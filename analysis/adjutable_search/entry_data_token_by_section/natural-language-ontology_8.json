    "main_text": "Natural Language Ontology as a Subdiscipline of Both Linguistics and Philosophy || How Does Natural Language Reflect Ontology?\n2.2 How Does Natural Language Reflect Ontology?\n\nIt is a guiding assumption of natural language ontology that natural\nlanguage reflects ontology. That is, the semantics of natural\nlanguages involves entities of various ontological categories,\nontological structures, and ontological notions on the basis of\nsyntactic roles of expressions, syntactic categories and features, and\nlexical words. The following will elaborate some of the ways in which\nnatural language reflects ontology. \n2.2.1 Entities in different semantic roles\n\nFirst of all, entities may play various roles in the semantic\nstructure of natural language sentences. To an extent, it depends on\nparticular semantic theories about relevant constructions or\nexpressions, though, what entities play what sorts of roles\n (\u00a72.2.2).\n \n2.2.1.1 Semantic values of referential NPs and variables\n\nMost importantly, entities play a role as the semantic values of\nreferential noun phrases (NPs), as the things that quantificational\nNPs range over, and as arguments of predicates. Referential NPs are\noccurrences of NPs in sentences in which they have the function of\nstanding for entities. Natural language comes with a wealth of\nexpressions referring to or quantifying over entities, as well as a\nwealth of expressions that express properties of entities (or\nrelations among them). The standard view is that with the utterance of\na simple sentence like the apple is red, the property\nexpressed by red is attributed to the entity the speaker\nrefers to with the apple.\n\nThe notion of a referential NP has played a central role in\nphilosophical discussions about ontological commitment; it is an\nimportant notion in semantics and also plays a role in syntactic\ntheory. Names and definite NPs can serve as referential NPs, as can\nspecific indefinites and certain determinerless (bare) plurals and\nmass nouns. Only certain syntactic positions are reserved for\nreferential NPs, such as the subject or the object position of\nextensional predicates, as opposed to intensional predicates like\nlook for, intentional predicates like imagine, and\nexistence predicates like exist and occur. There are\nvarious syntactic and semantic criteria for referential NPs. For\nphilosophers, since Frege, they include the ability of an NP to\nsupport anaphora, to be replaceable by quantificational NPs, and to\nserve as an argument of ordinary (i.e., extensional) predicates (Frege\n1892; Hale 1987). For syntacticians, referential NPs also must satisfy\ncertain syntactic conditions: they are generally taken to have the\nmore complex structure of a determiner phrase (DP) rather than just\nthat of what syntacticians take to be an NP, NPs being able to be used\nonly predicatively (Abney 1987; Borer 2005).\n\nThe notion of a referential NP (or Eigenname\n\u2018name\u2019 as it was called at the time) already plays a\ncentral role in Frege\u2019s (1892) philosophy of language, where it\nprovides a syntactic criterion for being an entity. For Frege, an\nentity is what can be the semantic value of a referential NP, since\nstanding for an entity is the role of a referential NP in the context\nof a sentence.\n\nEntities also play a role as semantic values of quantificational NPs,\nmore precisely, the variables that serve to formalize them.\nOntological commitment has been tied to the role of semantic values of\nvariables by Quine (1948), who put forward the dictum \u201cto be is\nto be the value of a variable\u201d. This was meant to apply not so\nmuch to natural language, though, but to regimentations of it in\nformal theories of science. Yet being the semantic value of a variable\nor being in the domain of a quantificational NP has become a\nwell-established criterion for being an entity in the practice of\nnatural language ontology.\n\nSome caution needs to be applied to both the Fregean and the Quinean\ncriterion of objecthood. There are apparently referential NPs whose\nfunction is not that of standing for an actual entity, for example the\nsubjects of negative existentials (Santa Claus does not\nexist) and the arguments of intentional verbs (John is\nthinking about Santa Claus). Furthermore, there are Meinongian\nviews according to which reference and quantification are not actually\nexistence-entailing but only lexical predicates are\n (\u00a73.2;\n Priest 2005). Moreover, there are views according to which\nreferential and quantificational NPs do not always range over\nentities, but may just have an inferential role (Hofweber 2016).\nFinally, not all quantificational NPs have the same semantic role,\nranging over entities that will also act as arguments of the embedding\npredicate. Quantificational NPs of the sort something,\neverything, and several things in English, which can\ntake the place of predicative complements as well as other\nnonreferential positions, have been argued to have a nominalizing\nfunction, introducing \u201cnew\u201d entities into the semantic\nstructure of a sentence (Moltmann 2013: Chap. 3) or to be non-nominal\nquantifiers, ranging over the same higher-order entities as are the\nsemantic values of the expressions they may replace (Rosefeldt\n2008).\n\nThe notion of a referential NP also plays a central role in the\ntradition of Montague Grammar, where referential NPs are taken to be\nof type e, the type of entities (Montague 1974). Montague\nhimself, though, also proposed type-lifting referential NPs to the\ntype of individual concepts (of type \\(\\langle\\langle e, t\\rangle,\nt\\rangle\\)). This was meant to allow for semantic uniformity with\nrespect to NPs that for Montague must stand for individual concepts,\nsuch as the rising temperature, the golden mountain,\nand the mathematician John claims to be (but see\n \u00a73.1.1).\n The move no longer maintains a straightforward notion of a\nreferential NP and thus a criterion for entities being part of the\nontology of natural language.\n2.2.1.2 Implicit arguments\n\nAnother role entities may play in the semantic structure of sentences\nis that of implicit arguments, that is, arguments of predicates that\nare not also the semantic values of referential NPs. For example, on\nDavidson\u2018s (1967) influential analysis of adverbial\nmodification, the sentence John walked slowly states that\nthere is an event which, together with John, is an argument of\nwalk and of which slowly (now treated as a predicate\nof events) is true  \n\\[\\exists e(\\textrm{walk}(e, \\textrm{John}) \\amp \\textrm{slowly}(e)).\\]\n\n\nThe very same considerations that lead Davidson to posit events as\nimplicit arguments apply to adjectives and motivate tropes as\narguments of adjectives. John is profoundly happy will then\nstate that there is a happiness trope that, together with John, is an\nargument of happy and of which profoundly is true\n \n\\[\\exists t(\\textrm{happy}(t, \\textrm{John}) \\amp \\textrm{profoundly}(t)).\\]\n\n\nInstead of tropes, degrees have been used widely as implicit arguments\nof adjectives (Kennedy 2007; Wellwood 2015). Other implicit arguments\nproposed in the literature are implicit location arguments for weather\npredicates (it is raining) (Perry 1986) and implicit taste\nparameters for predicates of personal taste (Stephenson 2007).\nImplicit arguments are posited when expressions appear to act as\npredicates targeting entities for which there are no overt NPs in the\nsyntactic context.\n\nThe semantic role of implicit arguments raises the question whether\nthere is a difference in ontological status between entities that are\nimplicit arguments and entities that are semantic values of\nreferential NPs. Davidson\u2019s arguments for events are generally\ntreated as stronger arguments for events being part of the ontology of\nnatural language than the fact that there are event-referring NPs,\nwhich may have to do with the distinction between core and periphery\nof language\n (\u00a74.1).\n There are alternatives to Davidson\u2019s semantics of adverbials,\nthough, which do not posit such implicit arguments (Kim 1976; Copley\n& Harley 2015).\n2.2.1.3 Parameters of evaluation and truthmakers\n\nYet another important role of entities in the semantic structure of\nnatural language is that of a parameter of evaluation for the truth of\nsentences. The standard semantic view takes a sentence to be true or\nfalse not absolutely, but relative to a time and a (possible) world.\nThis first of all gives justice to the intuition that sentences can be\ntrue or false in actual as well as counterfactual circumstances.\nMoreover, there are natural language expressions that have been\nconsidered operators shifting a parameter of evaluation. Tenses and\ntemporal adverbials are standardly taken to act as operators shifting\nthe time of evaluation and modals as operators shifting the world of\nevaluation. Also conditionals are generally treated as potentially\nshifting the world of evaluation for antecedent and consequent.\n\nThere is generally taken to be a difference in ontological commitment\nbetween parameters of evaluation on the one hand and semantic values\nof referential terms and implicit arguments of predicates on the\nother. It is generally understood that parameters of evaluation do not\ninvolve an ontological commitment on the part of the language user,\nbut are mere posits in the semantic theory, which means they have a\nstatus as entities only in the semantic metalanguage. Parameters of\nevaluation involve an ontological commitment on the part of the\nlanguage users only if there are referential expression in the object\nlanguage making reference to them, or so the general view appears to\nbe. For example, there are referential expressions in English\nreferring to times (today, that day, that moment, etc), but\nnot those referring to worlds, at least not from the core of language\n (\u00a74.1).\n Frege\u2019s criterion of objecthood of course does not apply to\nparameters of evaluation (and, in fact, it did not even apply to\nimplicit arguments).\n2.2.1.4 Other semantic roles for situations\n\nSituations have been considered parameters of evaluation, but they\nplay yet other semantic roles within particular approaches to natural\nlanguage semantics (see entry on\n situations in natural language semantics).\n Thus, in Austin\u2019s (1950) theory of sentence meaning, a speaker,\nwhen uttering a sentence, refers to a situation that provides semantic\nvalues for context-dependent expressions. Does this mean an\nontological commitment to situations? The answer to that question\nbears on another criterion for ontological commitment, that of an\nentity being part of the intended meaning of a sentence. Certainly, an\nontological commitment to situations is in place if situations must\nform part of the intention of speakers when correctly using a\nsentence, as is the case on that theory. This is also the case for\nvarious roles of situations in semantic analyses of definite and\nquantificational NPs, as well as E-type pronouns (Elbourne 2005). By\ncontrast, situations play a role strictly outside the (intended)\nmeaning of a sentence in R\u00e9canati\u2019s (2010) theory of\npragmatic enrichment.\n\nIn the more recent development of truthmaker semantics (Fine 2017b),\nsituations play somewhat similar roles to worlds as parameters of\nevaluation for the truth of sentences, though truthmakers are based on\na more restricted relation of exact truthmaking between situations and\nsentences. Situations in their role as truthmakers, it has been\nargued, also act as semantic values of referential and\nquantificational NPs, namely NPs with case as head noun\n(Moltmann 2021a), which would amount to an explicit ontological\ncommitment, in both the Fregean and the Quinean sense.\n2.2.2 The connection between ontology and compositionality\n\nThe ontology of natural language is intimately linked to\ncompositionality, the chief tenet of natural language semantics. Which\nentities play a role in the semantic structure of natural language\ndepends very much on what the semantic contribution of occurrences of\nexpressions to the composition of the meaning of the sentence is taken\nto be. Different compositional semantic analyses of the language may\nthus go along with different ontologies. This means that the choice of\nan ontology may depend on the choice of a compositional semantic\ntheory, which in turn may depend on the choice of a syntactic theory.\nGenerally, the contribution of referential NPs is taken to be that of\nstanding for entities and the role of predicates that of expressing\nproperties that are applied to entities. There is a formal\nalternative, though, on which referential NPs denote higher-level\nfunctions (individual concepts) that apply to predicate denotations\n (\u00a72.2.1.1).\n What is most important is that for the purpose of compositionality\nthe contributions of referential NPs and of predicates are the same in\ndifferent types of sentences. Sometimes, different syntactic analyses\nmay have significant consequences for ontological issues, such as the\nanalysis of the number of planets is eight as an identity\nstatement about numbers (Frege) as opposed to an analysis of the\nsentence as a so-called specificational sentence, conveying a\nquestion-answer relation\n (\u00a71.6).\n\nThere is also a view according to which the semantic role of\nexpressions reflects ontology. Specifically this view has been held by\nFrege, for whom predicates stand for concepts, that is, unsaturated\nentities that need to apply to an object to yield a truth value (entry\non\n Frege,\n see also Liebesman 2015, who takes a critical stance).\n2.2.3 Ontological categories and syntactic categories, positions, and structures\n\nNatural language may manifest ontology also in its syntactic\ncategories, which often appear to reflect ontological categories.\nThus, verbs are generally taken to reflect the category of events\n(Szab\u00f3 2015), and adjectives the category of tropes or\nparticularized properties (Williams 1953; Strawson 1959). Syntactic\ncategories do not strictly correlate with ontological categories,\nthough. Be in a hurry, be hurried, and\nhurry all are predicates seemingly standing for the same\nproperty, but based on the lexical content of a noun, an adjective,\nand a verb, respectively. Another, mere tendency of a correlation is\nthat of the syntactic mass-count distinction with the distinction\nbetween stuff and individuals\n (\u00a73.3).\n\nThere is no agreement, at this point, as to the ontological content of\nsyntactic category distinctions. This is a difficult issue also\nbecause there is a lot of cross-linguistic variation as to what\nsyntactic categories natural languages display (Gil 2000). Moreover,\nthere are theoretical developments in syntax that put familiar\nsyntactic category distinctions into question and require at least a\nrecasting of the issue. For example, in distributive morphology (Halle\n& Marantz 1993; Borer 2005), lexical elements (roots) are not\nassociated with syntactic categories in the lexicon. Only when they\nare inserted in a syntactic structure will they be associated with\nsyntactic categories, which means that they cannot owe any\nontologically relevant lexical content to a syntactic category.\nAnother example is the theory of radical lexical decomposition (Hale\n& Kayser 2002), according to which a range of full verbs are\nderived from combinations of a light verb and a noun, e.g.,\nwalk from take a walk (take being the light\nverb and walk the noun). This view gives up a close\nconnection between events and the category of verbs, but posits a much\ngreater range of nouns instead that underlie full verbs.\n\nOntological categories in natural language may be reflected in other\nways in syntax than in syntactic categories, for example in syntactic\npositions. On the recent cartographic theory of syntax (Cinque &\nRizzi 2010), syntactic positions in a sentence or an NP are associated\nwith a semantic content, which often amounts to an ontological\ncategory. For example different positions for adjectival modifiers in\nan NP are distinguished for modifiers of number, size, shape, and\ncolor.\n\nAnother correlation of syntactic structure with ontology may concern\nthe different types of situations that serve as truthmakers for\ndifferent types of modal auxiliaries (Ramchand 2018).\n2.2.4 Metaphysically relevant specific expressions and constructions\n\nBesides syntactic categories, natural language displays particular\ntypes of expressions and constructions that appear to express\nmetaphysical notions. Examples are of course the copula be,\nwhich conveys identity, predication, existence, and perhaps other\nrelated notions, modals that convey metaphysical modality (may,\nmust, essential, the nature of), existence predicates that convey\nexistence or ways of being (exist, occur, obtain)\n (\u00a71.2),\n ontological dependence (which may be conveyed by have or the\npossessor construction), part-whole-related expressions (Vieu 2006),\nexpressions of causation (make, cause) (Swanson 2012), and\ntruth (Hinzen & Wiltschko forthcoming, Moltmann 2021b). In\naddition, there are various nominal constructions that serve to denote\nentities of particular categories, perhaps introduced in particular\nconstruction-specific ways\n (\u00a73.1)\n\nWith metaphysically relevant expressions, there is a general issue\nwhether they may be used as technical terms pertaining to a particular\nphilosophical view, in which case the expressions may be regarded as\npart of the periphery of language, not displaying an ontological\nnotion that is part of the ontology of natural language\n (\u00a74.1).\n Nouns such as existence, property, being,\nevent, and number may be candidates since they can\nbe used with particular philosophical notions in mind, unlike the verb\nexist\n (\u00a71.3)\n and copula and modal verbs, which do not permit non-ordinary,\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d uses.\n2.2.5 Chomskyan skepticism about reference to objects in the semantics of natural language\n\nAs mentioned in\n Section 1.3,\n the view that referential NPs stand for objects is not\nuncontroversial. It has been the target of critique particularly by\nChomsky (1986; 1995; 2013), who put forward various challenges to the\ntraditional notion of reference as a relation to \u201creal\u201d\nobjects in a mind-independent reality. These are for the most part\ncases of inconsistent property ascriptions that objects on standard\nviews would not be able to bear. For example, what we refer to as a\n\u201cdoor\u201d could be painted, replaced, and walked through,\nproperties that could not be attributed jointly to material objects as\nstandardly understood. Another example Chomsky gives is a home, which\nunlike a house may have peculiar combinations of properties: one can\nown or sell a home, but not, for example paint a home. Other examples\nare cities, which can be destroyed and rebuilt at a different\nlocation, artifacts, which can undergo complete replacement of their\nparts, and persons with their relative independence of the bodies.\nEven terms like water, Chomsky (1995) argues, do not stand\nfor an external substance, but are individuated in part by their roles\nin people\u2019s lives. For example, water can be polluted but not\nH2O. Moreover, Sprite has the same percentage of\nH2O as tap water, but one would not call it water, water\nbeing individuated by function, not just chemical composition.\n\nAgainst the background of traditional assumptions of how reality and\nthe individuation of objects is to be conceived\n (\u00a71.3),\n Chomsky\u2019s conclusion is that natural language does not involve\nthe reference relation, as a relation to \u201creal\u201d objects.\nThe semantics of referential noun phrases rather involves\nlexical/conceptual structures deployed by speakers in particular\ncontexts to refer to particular aspects of reality. Instead of a\nsemantics with the (traditional) notion of external reference as its\ncentral notion, referential terms should have an internalist\nsemantics, involving another level of syntactic representation, that\nof lexical-conceptual structure. This view will then require a\ndifferent conception of compositionality than the standard one. Rather\nthan being based on objects and properties, compositional semantics\nwill have to do with concepts only or concepts together with mental\ninstructions (Pietroski 2018).\n\nChomsky\u2019s position, which denies that speakers using referential\nNPs refer to objects (on a particular standard understanding), appears\nto imply a rejection of natural language ontology as such. There are\ndifferent kinds of ontological responses to the various Chomskyan\nchallenges. First, one may adopt a different conception of reality.\nReality need not be conceived as a mind-independent realm of material\nobjects, subject to particular constraints on their spatio-temporal\nlocation. Instead it may be taken to consist in a plenitude of\nentities, including entities that are individuated by function and\npurposes. Second, one may adopt non-standard notions of an object that\nallow for apparently contradictory property attributions, such as\n\u201ccomplex objects\u201d that obtain properties from distinct\nentities of which they are composed (Arapinis & Vieu 2015) or\n\u201cvariable embodiments\u201d that inherit properties from\ndifferent manifestations (Fine 1999). A third type of response is to\nrevise standard views of predication by having predicates apply to\nunderspecified conceptual units (\u201cdot objects\u201d), which are\nthen mapped them onto real objects (Pustejovsky 1995) or to have\npredication be based on particular ways of property inheritance from\nparts or constituting matter (Liebesman & Magidor 2017). \n3. Distinctive Features of the Ontology of Natural Language\n3.1 Complex NPs and Constructional Ontology\n\nThe pursuit of natural language ontology appears to go along with a\nview of ontological pluralism according to which there is not a single\nontology, but several ontologies associated with different cognitive\nor representational functions, in addition to the ontology of what\nthere ultimately is. The following sections will discuss cases that\nappear to show a discrepancy between the ontology of natural language\nand the reflective ontology of ordinary speakers, that is, the\nontology speakers naively accept when thinking about what there is, an\nontology that includes the ontology of ordinary objects. They are just\nsome of examples of the wealth of \u201cderivative\u201d or\n\u201cminor\u201d entities that referential NPs may stand for and\nthat are likely to be rejected by speakers of the language when\nthinking about there is. Referential NPs standing for such\ncontroversial entities satisfy the very same criteria of\nreferentiality as NPs standing for less controversial entities, by\naccepting the same sorts of predicates as ordinary referential NPs,\nsupporting anaphoric pronouns, and being replaceable by\nquantifiers.\n3.1.1 Reference to unrestricted sums and kinds\n\nThe first case involves definite plurals and mass nouns as well as\nconjunctions of definite NPs. The dominant view in natural language\nsemantics is that the semantics of such NPs involves an ontology of\nunrestricted sums of individuals (in the case of plurals) and of\nquantities (in the case of mass NPs). That is, the things in my\ngarden stands for the sum of the things in my garden, the\ndefinite mass NP the sand in the Sahara stands for the sum of\nthe sand quantities in the Sahara, and the Eiffel Tower and the\nDalai Lama stands for the sum of the Eiffel Tower and the Dalai\nLama (Link 1983; Champollion & Krifka 2017; Ojeda 1993).\nMotivations for that view are that definite plurals and mass NPs\nexhibit standard criteria of referentiality and share predicates with\nsingular NPs with the same readings. Thus, heavy displays\nreadings applying to the entire referent of the definite NPs\nbelow:\n\n(3)\n\n\na.\n The stone is heavy\nb.\n The stones are heavy.\nc.\n The sand is heavy.\n\n\n\nA sum of individuals is generally understood on the basis of a part\nrelation specific to plurals and distinct from the part relation\napplying to individuals (Link 1979; Ojeda 1993).\n\nIf definite plural and mass NPs and conjunctions of definite NPs stand\nfor sums, they do not impose any restrictions on sum formation, which\nmeans that the ontology of natural language displays mereological\nuniversalism (see entry on\n mereology).\n Mereological universalism is generally not taken to obtain for the\nontology of ordinary objects, where sum formation appears subject to\nconditions of integrity (such as having a form or boundary) that the\npotential sum must fulfill (Simons 1987) or by teleological conditions\nof purpose (Rose & Schaffer 2017)\n (\u00a71.5).\n Such restrictions need not obtain for sum formation in the ontology\nof the real or fundamental, where mereological universalism is a\nplausible view.\n\nA similar issue arises with the denotation of bare (determinerless)\nplurals and mass nouns such as dinosaurs or water.\nBare plurals and mass nouns in English are generally taken to be able\nto act as terms referring to kinds (Carlson 1977):\n\n(4)\n\n\na.\nPigeons are widespread\nb.\n Water is transparent\n\n\n\nPredicates of kinds include those conveying properties of the kind as\na whole, as in\n (4a),\n and those conveying properties characteristic of the instances of the\nkind, as in\n (4b).\n The kind-referential status of the bare nouns in\n (4a, b)\n is supported by the usual criteria for referentiality. \nPigeons will thus stand for a kind whose instances are particular\npigeons, and water will stand for a kind (substance) whose\ninstances are particular water quantities.\n\nThe semantics of bare plurals and mass nouns involves a particular\nnotion of kind: kind formation for the purpose of the semantics of\nbare plural and mass nouns is unrestricted. Bare plurals like\ntypographical mistakes, old pink buttons or\ncheap red wine are semantically entirely on a par with\npigeons, displaying the same semantic characteristic readings\nof predicates. Those would hardly be considered kinds in folk\nmetaphysics or the ontology of the real, where not just any\ninstantiated (non-natural) property corresponds to a kind. \n\nSuch a divergence also holds for qualities. In the tradition of\nAristotle\u2019s Categories (see entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s Categories),\n bare adjective nominalizations such as wisdom in\n (5)\n can be regarded terms for qualities, universals whose instances have\nbeen taken to be tropes (modes or Aristotelian accidents) (Lowe\n2006):\n\n(5)\n Wisdom is better than cleverness.\n\n\nAs a universal, \u201cwisdom\u201d will have as its instances tropes\nsuch as Socrates\u2019 wisdom or the wisdom of that remark. With bare\nplurals and adjective nominalizations, English appears to reflect the\nAristotelian four-category ontology of individuals (primary\nsubstances), kinds of individuals (secondary substances), tropes\n(accidents/modes), and kinds of tropes (qualities). Like Aristotelian\nsecondary substances, the kinds that bare plurals stand for generally\ninherit their properties from their instances (Pigeons can\nfly) and exist only if instantiated (Pigeons exists\nimplies the existence of an individual pigeon). However, qualities as\ndenotations of bare adjectives are unrestricted.\nIrregularity, dirtiness, and underserved\nwealth will likewise stand for qualities, but not in any sense of\nnaturalness that would put them on a par with natural kinds.\n\nThe view that definite plurals and mass NPs and bare plurals and mass\nnouns stand for unrestricted sums or kinds is not uncontroversial. An\nalternative view that has been pursued for definite plurals is that of\nplural reference, the view according to which the definite plural\nthe stones refers to each stone at once, rather than\nreferring to a single plurality (Yi 2005; 2006; McKay 2006; Oliver\n& Smiley 2013; entry on\n plural quantification).\n There are various motivations for plural reference. One of them is\nthe intuition that a sentence such as\n (3b)\n is about the stones, not a distinct object that is the sum of stones.\nAnother motivation is the applicability of many and numerals\nlike ten to plurals (the stones are many / ten), but\nnot sums (?? the group / sum of the stones is many / ten).\nPlural reference is also motivated by the way the predicates are\nsome of and is one of are understood. If Genie\nis the name for the sum of Russell and Whitehead, only\n (6a)\n will be true, not\n (6b)\n (Yi 2005: 472):\n\n(6)\n\n\na.\nGenie is one of Frege and Genie.\nb.\n Genie is one of Frege and Russell and Whitehead.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, quantities as denotations of definite mass NPs (the\nsand) appear to behave neither as one nor as many and may\nultimately require a different account (Laycock 2006; McKay 2016).\n\nSimilar considerations shed doubt on bare plural and mass nouns\nreferring to kinds as single entities. For example, just as\n (7a),\n unlike\n (7b),\n cannot express the existence of a sum as an entity distinct from the\nindividuals,\n (8a)\n could not be used to make a claim about the existence of an entity\nthat is a possibly uninstantiated kind or property (Strawson 1959;\nWolterstorff 1970: Chap. 7), as opposed to\n (8b),\n which can be used that way:\n\n(7)\n\n\na.\nThe books exist.\nb.\n The sum of the books exists.\n\n(8)\n\n\na.\n Wisdom exists.\nb.\n The property of being wise exists.\n\n\n\nThere are two alternatives one might pursue for the semantics of kind\nterms of the sort of bare plurals and mass nouns: first, posit\nentities that fail to have properties themselves but have properties\nstrictly on the basis of inheritance from their instances; second,\nextend plural reference to bare plurals and mass nouns, by taking them\nto plurally refer to all the possible instances (Moltmann 2013: chap.\n2).\n3.1.2 Intensional definite NPs\n\nNPs such as the increasing air in the balloon, the rising\ntemperature, the people that can fit into the car, or\nthe book John needs to write appear to behave like\nreferential NPs and have been analyzed as standing for particular\nsorts of entities, variable embodiments or variable objects (Fine\n1999; Moltmann 2013: chap. 4), entities that are hardly part of the\nontology speakers in general accept when thinking about what there is.\nThere are alternatives to the ontological analysis, though, such as\nthat of Montague (Montague 1974), who took the temperature to\nstand for a functional concept, and of Grosu & Krifka (2007), who\ntook the related NP the gifted mathematician you claim to be\nto stand for an individual concept.\n3.1.3. Introduction of entities by abstraction\n\nAn important way of introducing abstract objects that has been\ndiscussed in the philosophical literature is that of abstraction from\nconcepts (Frege 1884; Wright 1983; Hale 1987). A related view is that\nof pleonastic entities introduced by \u201csomething-from-nothing\ntransformations\u201d on the basis of nonreferential expressions\n(Schiffer 1996). Are these strategies part of the (constructional)\nontology of natural language? On the Fregean view, abstraction is part\nof the semantics of functional number terms like the number of\nplanets, which, on that view, introduce a number on the basis of\na concept (the concept planet) and the relation of equinumerosity. The\npleonastic account was originally applied to that-clauses and\nnominals like the property of being wise (Schiffer 1996). The\nmethod of introducing objects on the basis of nonreferential\nexpressions has been argued to be associated with the compositional\nsemantics of close appositions of the sort the number eight\nand the truth value true, as well as other \u201creifying\nterms\u201d of the sort the property of being wise and\nthe fact that S (Moltmann 2013: chap. 6). The use of\nthe abstraction strategy may serve the purpose of enlarging the domain\nof the ontology of natural language by choice, if reifying terms are\npart of the \u201cperiphery\u201d, not the \u201ccore\u201d of\nlanguage\n (\u00a74.1).\n The introduction of entities by abstraction, though, also appears to\nunderlie the Kimian notion of events, as opposed to the Davidsonian\none of events as primitives (Kim 1976; Davidson 1967; Maienborn\n2007).\n3.2 Intentional or Nonexistent Objects\n\nThe view that there are nonexistent or intentional objects,\nMeinongianism, is a highly controversial philosophical view (van\nInwagen 2003; entries on\n existence,\n nonexistent objects,\n fictional entities).\n But it is a view that is often motivated or defended by appeal to\nnatural language (Fine 1982; van Inwagen 1977; Kripke 2013; McGinn\n2000; Parsons 1980; Priest 2005; Salmon 1987, 1998; Thomasson 1999),\nnamely sentences with existence predicates or intentional verbs such\nas look for or think about:\n\n(9)\n\n\na.\n Pegasus does not exist.\nb.\n John thought about / was looking for Pegasus.\n\n\n\nThe Meinongian takes Pegasus in\n (9a)\n and\n (9b)\n to stand for a nonexistent object. There is an alternative view,\nthough, on which it is an exceptional, empty occurrence of a name\n(Sainsbury 2005). Linguistic support for the Meinongian view comes\nfrom the fact that Pegasus in\n (8a)\n and\n (8b)\n fulfills standard criteria for referential terms, such as supporting\nanaphora and allowing for replacement by quantifiers\n(something), as well as from the compositional semantics of\nconstructions with relative clauses as below (Moltmann 2016):\n\n(10)\n\n\na.\nThe building John thought about does not exist.\nb.\n John thought about a building that does not exist.\n\n\n\nA compositional semantics of the relative clause constructions in\n (10a, b)\n can hardly be achieved without positing intentional objects as\narguments of both think about and exist. The task\nfor natural language ontology then is to develop a theory of\nintentional objects that is both coherent and does justice to their\nrestricted occurrences in the semantic structure of sentences.\n\nIf descriptive metaphysics is conceived as the \u201cmetaphysics of\nappearances\u201d, this might suggest that non-existent objects would\nhave to be posited as semantic values of referential NPs even with\nextensional predicates. Referential NPs should reflect entities of a\ncertain sort whether or not they exist. However, non-intentional\npredicates are existence-entailing (Priest 2005), which means that in\nextensional contexts only actual entities as semantic values of\nreferential NPs contribute to truth conditions. Thus, the building\nis tall is true only if the building being referred to is an\nactual building that is tall. In extensional contexts, referential NPs\nthat turn out not to refer to actual entities better fail to have a\nsemantic value rather than standing for nonexistent objects. \n\nIn intensional contexts, intentional objects have been posited also as\nsemantic values of anaphora, both within the context of an attitude of\na single agent and across attitudinal contexts involving different\nagents (Edelberg 1986). In those contexts, intentional objects serve\nas discourse referents (Karttunen 1976) and thus interact with dynamic\nsemantics, being individuated not just by what properties agents\nattribute to them, but also by the flow of information in the\ndiscourse (Edelberg 1986). Discourse referents in fact have sometimes\nbeen conceived ontologically even in extensional contexts (Landman\n1986), though this is not the dominant view in dynamic semantics (see\nentry on\n dynamic semantics).\n3.3 The Mass-Count Distinction\n\nThe mass-count distinction displays, in a particularly striking way, a\ndiscrepancy between the ontology displayed by natural language and the\nontology tied to cognition or what is generally taken to be the\nontology of the real. Various criteria distinguish count nouns from\nmass nouns in English. Most important is the availability of the\nplural and the applicability of cardinal and ordinal numerals with\ncount nouns, but not mass nouns (Pelletier & Schubert 1989/ 2003;\nDoetjes 2012). The mass-count distinction, it is generally agreed, has\nsemantic content, but there is much less agreement as to what that\ncontent amounts to (see entry on\n metaphysics of mass expressions).\n The mass-count distinction has often been taken to reflect the\nontological distinction between individuals (chair, door) and\nmatter or stuff (metal, wood), a distinction that has been\ncast either in terms of the notion of having a boundary or integrity\nor being an atom (with respect to some concept). However, more\nrecently linguists have drawn attention to a number of generalizations\nthat indicate that the distinction between singular count, mass, and\nplural nouns does not strictly go along with an ontological\ndistinction between different types of beings (Pelletier &\nSchubert 1989/2003; Chierchia 1998; Moltmann 1997; Rothstein 2017).\nFirst, singular count NPs seem to be able to stand for the very same\nthings as definite plural or mass NPs (the (loose) collection of\nstuff on this desk\u2014the stuff on this desk, the quantity of\nliquid in the container\u2014the liquid in the container).\nSecond, languages may make a choice of mass as opposed to count\nwithout apparent perceptual differences (rice\u2014oats,\ncorn\u2014peas, cattle\u2014cows). Also\ncross-linguistically, the choice of mass versus count for particular\nentities appears to an extent arbitrary (English\nhair\u2014Italian capelli, English\npasta\u2014French p\u00e2tes). Third, there is an\nimportant class of so-called object mass nouns, mass nouns that appear\nto stand for pluralities of well-individuated objects, such as\nhardware, jewelry, luggage, staff,\npolice force, often competing with apparent co-extensional\nplural nouns in the same language (clothes\u2014clothing,\npolicemen\u2014police force, cows\u2014cattle,\ncarpets\u2014carpeting). Yet like other mass nouns, object mass\nnouns resist numerals (* the three police force) as well as a\nrange of other predicates applicable to plurals (John listed the\nclothes / ??? the clothing, The policemen / ??\nthe police force are / is numerous). Whether a language\nchooses a singular count, plural, or mass noun appears to an extent\narbitrary; yet the choice between mass and count plays a role for the\napplicability of number-related predicates and quantifiers. The\nmass-count distinction thus displays a form of \u201cgrammaticized\nindividuation\u201d (Rothstein 2017), involving a language-driven\nnotion of unity that may diverge from the notion of unity that\npertains to cognition or what is taken to be the real structure of\nthings.\n4. The Issue of Ontologies\n4.1 The Ontology of Natural Language and the Core-Periphery Distinction\n\nNot only metaphysical assertions are generally set aside when pursuing\nnatural language ontology. Philosophers when clarifying metaphysical\nintuitions make use only of certain sorts of expressions (or uses of\nexpressions) and not others, and so for a linguist interested in the\nontology of natural language. Certainly, they will not appeal to\ntechnical philosophical expressions or uses of expressions, that is,\n(uses of) expressions meant to convey philosophical notions arrived at\nby reflection, whether by philosophers or non-philosophers (the\n\u201cfolk\u201d). It is a characteristic feature of natural\nlanguage to allow for expansion, permitting at least certain\ntypes of expressions to be used with a particular intended meaning and\nto allow conveying new concepts through the formation of new\nexpressions, by means of morphological processes or syntactic\ncomposition. These are entirely legitimate ways of using language, but\nthey are generally set aside when philosophers appeal to language as a\nway of clarifying metaphysical intuitions. For example, Heidegger\nintroduced the nominalization das Nichts \u201cthe\nnothing\u201d as well as the verb nichten \u201cto\nnothing\u201d. While this is not an illegitimate use of language, no\nphilosopher or linguist would take the existence of the nominalization\nor the verb to be evidence for there to be an entity that is a nothing\nor a corresponding process or state. Likewise, the possibility of\nforming, legitimately, the term the truth value true is\ncertainly never taken as evidence for truth values being entities.\nAnother example is the various meanings philosophers associate with\nthe noun existence. The fact that there are different notions\nof existence that different philosophers endorse and associate as the\nmeaning of the noun existence does not mean that the ontology\nof natural language reflects those notions all at once. As was\nmentioned in\n Section 2.2.4,\n not all expressions allow for \u201cnon-ordinary\u201d or\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d uses in that way. Expressions that belong\nto the functional part of grammar generally do not, such as\nauxiliaries (have, be, can, may), determiners, and\nquantifiers, and neither does the verb exist\n (\u00a71.3).\n\nPhilosophers and non-philosophers when engaging in ontological\nreflection may use or introduce expressions specifically meant to\nconvey their own ontological views. But such (uses of) expressions are\nnever considered indicative of the ontology implicit in natural\nlanguage. Yet they should come with a semantics as well, and may have\nto be assigned as semantic values entities or properties, even if\nfictional, in order to be integrated within a single compositional\nsemantics of the language. Still a distinction needs to be maintained,\nin some way, between what is implicitly accepted as part of our\nlinguistically manifest intuitions (non-technical expressions with\ntheir ordinary meaning) and what is added on through reflection.\n\nThe different ways in which the two sorts of linguistic data are\ntreated, by both philosophers and by linguists, motivate a distinction\nbetween the (ontological) core of natural language (or the\nuse of it) and its (ontological) periphery (Moltmann 2020c):\nonly the core, not the periphery, reflects our metaphysical intuitions\nand thus the ontology of natural language. Clearly, without a\ncore-periphery distinction, any ontological view or notion, as\nreflected in particular technical (uses) of terms, would be part of\nthe ontology of natural language. This would mean that the ontology of\nnatural language would no longer reflect metaphysical intuitions and\nwould comprise an unrestricted range of not generally mutually\ncompatible ontologies.\n\nThough the core-periphery distinction appears to have been tacitly\nmade throughout the history of philosophy as well as in the practice\nof contemporary semanticists, the task of making it precise faces\nconsiderable challenges. One challenge is to elaborate the distinction\ncontent-wise, say in terms of cognitive relations on the part of\nagents, distinguishing, in some way, between intuition or implicit\nacceptance and inferential or reflective acceptance (of part of the\nontology). A second challenge is to investigate whether the\ndistinction is grounded in the grammar of language. A plausible\nhypothesis to pursue is that it goes along with the divide between the\nfunctional part of language (which includes syncategorematic\nexpressions, syntactic categories and features, and auxiliary verbs)\nand the lexicon. The example of the contrast between\nexistence and exist suggests, though, that this may\nbe too simplified: the noun existence should belong to the\nperiphery (since it is able to convey just any notion of existence a\nparticular metaphysician has in mind), whereas the verb exist\nbelongs to the core, not permitting a non-ordinary use.\n\nThe question also arises whether and how the distinction relates to\nthe core-periphery distinction that Chomsky (1981, 1986) introduced\nfor syntax, where, very roughly, the core of the syntactic system of a\nlanguage represents universal grammar and the periphery exceptions and\noutside influences.\n\nNote that \u201cperiphery\u201d is not meant to mean\n\u201cmarginal\u201d in the sense of statistically less used.\nMoreover, it does not concern the kind of ontology itself: the\nperiphery may contain a technical use of a term which ends up denoting\nthe very same category or entity as a term from the core. What\nmatters, rather, is language-users\u2019 cognitive relation to\nsemantic values, whether it involves some form of reflection or\nderivative acceptance rather than implicit acceptance.\n\nGiven the core-periphery distinction,\n (2)\n will need to be revised as follows:\n\n(11)\n The ontology of a natural language is the ontology a speaker\nimplicitly accepts by way of making use of the core of the\nlanguage.\n\n\nThe periphery by itself imposes challenges for natural language\nsemantics and natural language ontology. The periphery, from a\nlinguistic point of view at least, is a legitimate part of natural\nlanguage (or a legitimate extension of it): technical (uses) of terms\ncertainly have a semantics and will reflect an ontology, even if it is\nnot the ontology of natural language, but one that goes beyond it. It\nis part of the task of natural language semantics to in principle\nallow for the semantic composition of the meaning of sentences\ncontaining philosophical (uses) of terms.\n\nIt has been argued that there is one kind of complex expression that\ngenerally belongs to the periphery, and that is reifying NPs of the\nsort the number eight, the property of being happy, the\nproposition that it is raining, or the truth value true\n(Moltmann 2020c). It is a general observation that philosophers\nusually stay away from reifying NPs when drawing on natural language\nfor motivating an ontological category. For example, Frege (1884) did\nnot motivate numbers as objects by appealing to the construction\nthe number eight in natural language, and he did not motivate\ntruth values as objects by appealing to the truth value true.\nRather he used expressions from the core like the number of\nplanets and eight when arguing for numbers being\nobjects, and his motivations for considering truth values to be\nobjects did not come from particular natural language sentences at\nall. Likewise, Hale (1987) argued for properties being objects not on\nthe basis of terms like the property of mercy, but rather\nsimple terms like mercy from the core of language. Finally,\nLink (1979) motivated mereological sums being part of the ontology of\nlanguage not on the basis of terms like the sum of the\nstudents from the periphery of language, but rather simple\ndefinite plurals like the students. The semantics of reifying\nterms itself appears to be associated with abstraction involving the\nintroduction of an entity on the basis of a nonreferential (use of) an\nexpression (Moltmann 2013, chap. 6). If such an operation of object\nintroduction (a form of derivative acceptance) defines the content of\nreifying terms\n (\u00a73.1.3),\n their classification as part of the periphery may become\nplausible.\n\nThe core-periphery distinction in natural language ontology would be\nimportant also for the quest for universals of natural language\nontology. Only the core reflects metaphysical intuitions, which are\ngenerally held to not display interpersonal inconsistency (see entry\non\n intuition).\n This means that only the core, not the periphery can represent a form\nof universal language-related ontology. Of course, the general\npresupposition that intuitions show no interpersonal inconsistency may\nbe in error, and so may be the assumption that the ontology of the\ncore is universal rather than showing language-particular\ndifferences.\n\nWhile philosophers and linguists generally appear to adopt a\ncore-periphery distinction implicitly, the distinction appears\nexplicitly in a general hypothesis about reference to abstract objects\nin natural language that has been pursued in Moltmann (2013):\n\n(12)\n\n\nThe Abstract-Objects Hypothesis\n\nNatural language does not involve reference to abstract objects in its\ncore, but only in its periphery. \n\n\nThe Abstract-Object Hypothesis is a particular thesis within\nnatural language ontology; it is not a methodological principle of\nnatural language ontology as such. This means that natural language\nontology, with (or even without) its core-periphery distinction, may\nbe pursued while not subscribing to the Abstract-Objects\nHypothesis.\n\nThe Abstract-Objects Hypothesis goes against the widely held belief\nthat reference to abstract objects in natural language is rampant\n (\u00a71.6).\n Based on a range of semantic and syntactic generalizations, Moltmann\n(2013) argues that this view is mistaken: what appear to be\nexpressions in the core of natural language, referring to abstract\nobjects (numbers, properties, propositions, degrees, expression types)\nare in fact expressions referring to particulars, pluralities of\n(actual or possible) particulars, or variable objects, or else they\nare expressions that fail to have a referential function in the first\nplace (numerals, clausal complements, predicative complements,\ncomplements of intensional transitive verbs). The particulars comprise\ntropes, including quantitative tropes (John\u2019s height) and number\ntropes (the number of planets) (see entry on\n tropes).\n Only in the periphery, so the view, is reference to abstract objects\npossible, for example through the use of reifying terms such as\nthe number eight, the property of being happy,\nthe word \u201chappy\u201d, or the proposition that it\nis raining. Thus, the view is that in its core, the ontology of\nnatural language displays a form of trope nominalism (see entry on\n nominalism in metaphysics).\n4.2 The Question of Ontologies\n\nDistinguishing different branches of metaphysics goes hand in hand\nwith the view according to which there is not a single ontology, but\nseveral, at least apparent, ontologies, ontologies pertaining to\nlanguage, to cognition, and to fundamental reality. But there is also\nthe question whether there is in fact a single ontology of natural\nlanguage. When natural language has been used to clarify metaphysical\nintuitions, the presupposition was that metaphysical intuitions do not\nshow interpersonal inconsistencies, which means that there is a unique\nontology reflected in the relevant ways in natural language. There are\nreasons to be skeptical of that presupposition. It is not necessarily\nthe case that there is a single ontology implicit in all natural\nlanguages, just as there may in fact be interpersonal differences\namong intuitions, which have now become the subject of experimental\nphilosophy (see entry on\n experimental philosophy).\n The proper subject matter of natural language ontology should thus be\nthe ontologies of natural languages. The possibility of\ninterlinguistic ontological differences touches touches upon the\nSapir-Whorf hypothesis and the controversy surrounding it (Pinker\n1994; Hespos & Spelke 2004; Pelletier 2011). Of course, it may\nturn out that the ontologies of natural languages are in fact the same\nor at least that there are constraints on how the they may differ from\neach other and what linguistic phenomena (of the lexical or functional\npart of grammar) such differences may pertain to. Assuming a\ndistinction between core and periphery, clearly, if there is a\nuniversal ontology shared by human languages, it should pertain to the\ncore only. Generative linguists may furthermore be interested in such\nconstraints, or a universal ontology, as a way of explaining how the\ngrammar of a language with the ontology that goes along with it can be\nlearned.\n5. Outlook\n\nNatural language ontology is just at the initial stage of developing\nas a discipline of its own. The methodological issues surrounding it\nstill await a serious discussion, such as the relation of the ontology\nreflected in language to different conceptions of reality and to\nontologies tied to other representational or cognitive functions, the\nparticular notion of implicit acceptance that the ontology of natural\nlanguage involves, the core-periphery distinction, the ontological\nstatus associated with different semantic roles, the way ontological\ncategories are reflected in natural language given recent theoretical\nsyntactic and cross-linguistic research, and the different connections\nof the ontology of natural language to the functional and the lexical\npart of grammar.",
