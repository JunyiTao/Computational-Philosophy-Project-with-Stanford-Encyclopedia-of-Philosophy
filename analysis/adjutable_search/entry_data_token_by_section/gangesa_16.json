    "main_text": "Testimony || An irreducible knowledge source\n7.1 An irreducible knowledge source\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhists have a pragmatic theory of\nconcept-formation and view language as at best helping us get what we\nwant and avoid what we want to avoid. The Buddha\u2019s words are to\nbe trusted because of his special experience and superior capacity as\na reasoner as well as his compassion motivating his most excellent\nadvice. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba imagines an attack on testimonial knowledge\nfrom Buddhist skeptical quarters such that, in fact, there is no\nknowledge but only helpful or unhelpful advice because there is no\ntruth, no veridicality. Statements do not correspond to facts.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s rebuttal centers on knowledge production\nthrough words. Any instance of knowledge has a mode of production\ndistinct from one that fails so to produce. The argument that\nerroneous utterances fail to generate knowledge cuts no ice, since\nerroneous utterances are not veritable testimony as we Naiy\u0101yikas\nunderstand it, he says (2020: 1215). We are able to distinguish\nerroneous and true utterances by the processes that produce them, and\nthus meet the skeptical challenge.\n\nA different line of rejection of testimony is attributed to the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika school, which is said to admit testimonial\nknowledge but to see its generation as coming from inference of a\ncertain sort. A hearer reasons: (1) Speaker \\(S\\) states p,\n(2) \\(S\\) is a \u201ctrustworthy authority,\u201d\n\u0101pta, (3) what such authorities state is true, and so,\ntherefore, (4) \\(p\\) is true. And if challenged, S could say that she\nknows \\(p\\) because of the inference. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s\nrebuttal centers on how premise (1) could be known. Testimony has to\nbe admitted as a separate knowledge source to understand how the\nreductionist\u2019s inference could get started. Just what is the\nknowledge source for (1)?\n",
