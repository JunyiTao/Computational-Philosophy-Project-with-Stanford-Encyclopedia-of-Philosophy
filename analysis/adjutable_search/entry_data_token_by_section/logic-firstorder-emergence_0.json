    "main_text": "George Boole\n1. George Boole\n\nThe modern study of logic is commonly dated to 1847, with the\nappearance of Boole\u2019s Mathematical Analysis of Logic.\nThis work established that Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic logic can be\ntranslated into an algebraic calculus, whose symbols Boole interpreted\nas referring either to classes or to propositions. His system\nencompasses what is today called sentential (or Boolean) logic, but it\nis also capable of expressing rudimentary quantifications. For\ninstance, the proposition \u201cAll Xs are Ys\u201d is\nrepresented in his system by the equation \\(xy = x\\), with the\nmultiplication being thought of either as an intersection of sets, or\nas logical conjunction. \u201cSome Xs are Ys\u201d is\nmore difficult, and its expression more artificial. Boole introduces a\n(tacitly: non-empty) set V containing the items common to\nX and Y; the proposition is then written \\(xy =\nV\\) (1847: 21). Boole\u2019s system, in modern terms, can be viewed\nas a fragment of monadic first-order logic. It is first-order because\nits notational resources cannot express a quantification that ranges\nover predicates. It is monadic because it has no notation for\nn-ary relations. And it is a fragment because it cannot express\nnested quantifications (\u201cfor every girl, there exists a boy who\nloves her\u201d). But these are our categories: not Boole\u2019s.\nHis logical system has no symbols corresponding to the quantifiers; so\neven to call it a restricted system of quantificational logic is\nanachronistic.\n\nThe two principal augmentations to Boole\u2019s system that produced\na recognizably modern logic were (a) the introduction, in addition to\none-placed predicates (\u201cx is mortal\u201d), of\nmany-placed relations (\u201cx is the brother of\ny\u201d; \u201cx lies between y and\nz\u201d); and (b) the introduction of a notation for universal\nand existential quantification. \n\nTwo logicians working in the Boolean tradition carried out these\nsteps. The first step was partially carried out by Augustus De Morgan\n(in De Morgan 1864). The second was carried out by C. S. Peirce (in\nPeirce 1885). Working entirely independently, Gottlob Frege carried\nout both steps simultaneously in his Begriffsschrift of 1879.\nThe subsequent history for several decades is a branching structure,\nwith numerous researchers working in different traditions and only\npartially aware of one another\u2019s accomplishments.\n",
