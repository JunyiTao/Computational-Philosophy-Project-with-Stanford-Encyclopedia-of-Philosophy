Its literal\nmeaning \u2013 good birth \u2013 suggests a suitable goal for all\nprospective parents, yet its historical connotations tie it to\nappalling policies, including forced sterilizations, selective breeding\nprograms in North America and Asia, and horrifying concentration camps\nand mass exterminations in Nazi Germany. Undoubtedly, we have an\nobligation never to forget the Holocaust, or indeed, any of the\nhorrible policies and actions that have been justified in the name of\ncreating better people. Yet intuitively we have some moral obligation\nto promote good births \u2013 to have, in the most literal sense,\neugenic aims. Indeed, if parents are encouraged to provide the best\nenvironment for their children (good nutrition, education, health care,\na loving family situation, etc.), why not also encourage them to ensure\ntheir children have good genes? And if we\nhave some moral obligation to secure the well-being\nof our future children (a question explored extensively in the\nliterature on the non-identity problem; see the entry on\n the nonidentity problem), \n do these obligations entail the\nuse of reprogenetic technologies and practices?  This question is\nparticularly important given that current genomic science and\ntechnology permit significant control over reproductive choices. Can\nthese contemporary practices be distinguished, in their aims, forms,\njustifications, and likely consequences, from the clearly morally\nimpermissible eugenic programs of the past?\n\n\nSome philosophers think they can be distinguished,\nand they have explored the desirability of a \u201cliberal\u201d or\n\u201cnew\u201d as opposed to an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d or\n\u201cold\u201d eugenics (Agar 2004). Liberal eugenics would be based\nupon prospective parents\u2019 free choice, pluralist values, and\nup-to-date scientific understanding of genomic science and technology.\nFurthermore, advocates of liberal eugenics aim to be sensitive to the\neffects of some problematic but deeply entrenched social problems\n(e.g., racism, sexism, heterosexism) on individual choice.\nAuthoritarian eugenics programs, in contrast, were coercive state\nprograms designed to promote social goods, and were based on\nproblematic scientific assumptions about hereditability. Liberal\neugenicists point to significant developments in our understanding of\ngenomic science to help distinguish contemporary liberal eugenics from\nits problematic predecessors. Indeed, scientific advances of the last\nseveral decades \u2013 years that include the advent of in vitro\nfertilization (IVF), the funding and completion of the Human Genome\nProject, creation of the National Human Genome Research Institute\n(NHGRI), and expansions of pre-implantation screening, prenatal testing\npanels, as well as development of genome editing \u2013 provide not only\nmore precise understandings of genes and their role in shaping\nphenotypes and gene-environment interactions, but also a multitude of\npossibilities for intervention in the process of reproduction. How\nought we to use this new knowledge and capacities? This entry proceeds\nas follows. It first offers a short history of the eugenics movement.\nThe second section presents some of the main arguments that attempt to\ndefine and defend a new or liberal eugenics. The last section covers a\nvariety of critiques of those arguments.\n", "toc": [{"#ShorHistEuge": "1. Short history of eugenics"}, {"#ArguForLibeEuge": "2.

Short history of eugenics\n\n\nPhilosophers have contemplated the meaning and\nvalue of eugenics at least since Plato recommended a state-run program\nof mating intended to strengthen the guardian class in\nhis Republic. However, the modern version of eugenics had\nits start with the 19th century cousin of Charles\nDarwin, British scientist Francis Galton (1883). Galton was interested\nin \u201cimproving human stock\u201d through scientific management of\nmating. His explicit goal was to create better humans. His ideas were\ntaken up widely in the early part of the 20th century\nby seemingly well-intended, and ideologically diverse, scientists and\npolicy makers, particularly in the United States, Britain, and the\nScandinavian countries. Notable eugenicists included Alexander Graham\nBell and Margaret Sanger. (For an excellent history of eugenics, see\nKevles 1985.)\n\n\nEugenicists had two-fold aims: to encourage people\nwith various desirable traits, e.g., health, intelligence, character,\nto reproduce together to create good births (what is known as\n\u201cpositive\u201d eugenics), and to end certain diseases and\ndisabilities by discouraging or preventing those with characteristics\nconsidered undesirable from reproducing (what is known as\n\u201cnegative\u201d eugenics). In the United States, programs to\nencourage positive eugenics involved the creation of \u201cFitter\nFamily Fairs\u201d in which families competed for prizes at local\ncounty fairs, much in the way that livestock is judged for conformation\nand physical dexterity (Stern 2002). Negative eugenics took the form of\nencouraged or forced sterilizations of men and, particularly, women\ndeemed unfit to reproduce (in the language of the day, this included\nindividuals who were \u201cpoor, mentally insane, feeble-minded,\nidiots, drunken\u201d and more). Much of eugenics ideology was\nreductionistic in nature, with many eugenicists assuming that social\nand behavioral conditions, such as poverty, vagrancy, or prostitution,\nwere inherited as genetic traits rather than shared as common social\nsituations. Nonetheless proponents of eugenic policies were aware of\nthe interplay between biology and the environment, even if they were\nnot very concerned with differentiating the various contributory\nfactors (Dyck 2014). Social problems such as alcoholism or diseases\nrelated to mental health were understood to have a genetic component\nthat could lead to difficulties in taking appropriate care of children\n(For an interesting discussion of the relevant social moral\nepistemology, see Buchanan 2007).\n\n\nRacist, sexist, ableist, xenophobic, and classist\nassumptions pervaded the discourse. In the US, for instance, alarm\ncalls were raised about the lower birth rates among white Protestant\nAmericans compared to the large immigrant Catholic populations of\nItalian and Irish descent. German scientists and policymakers visited\nthe United States to learn from their methods, and when the Nazis came\nto power in Germany, they began eugenic policies of their own. Early\nGerman policies called for the killing of people in institutions whose\nphysical or mental illnesses were deemed incurable. Such individuals\nwere considered to have \u201clives unworthy of life\u201d\n(lebensunwertes Leben). The Nazis\nalso encouraged selective breeding for Aryan traits (e.g., athletic,\nblond, blue-eyed). This policy quickly expanded to include bans on\nmarriage between particular groups, forced sterilization, and then\ninternment in concentration camps for individuals belonging to groups\ndeemed inferior (i.e., people who were disabled, homosexual, diagnosed\nwith psychiatric conditions, communists, considered to be Roma/gypsies,\nand/or Jewish). The purported aim was to promote the\n\u201chealth\u201d of the German population by controlling those who\nwere \u201cunhealthy.\u201d Prisoners faced extremely hard labor,\nmedical experimentation that was torturous and designed to test the\nlimits of the human body (Lifton 1986) and daily degradation and abuse.\nEventually, the Nazis escalated their eugenic program to the\n\u201cfinal solution\u201d of death camps, ultimately killing more\nthan six million Jewish people in the name of promoting Germany\u2019s\nhealth.\n\n\nFollowing the end of WWII, the term\n\u201ceugenic\u201d was so closely associated with the horrific\nprograms of Nazi Germany that eugenics societies across the world\nchanged their names (e.g., the American Eugenics Society became the\nSociety for the Study of Social Biology) and tempered their aims. Yet\nmany of the same practices and beliefs continued under a different\nguise, from immigration policies, to forced sterilization, to\npopulation control (Kevles 1985; MacLaren 1990; Kline 2001; Broberg and\nRoll-Hansen 2005; Lombardo 2008; Paul, Stenhouse, and Spencer 2018;\nWillson 2018). In the United States, involuntary eugenic sterilizations\nof \u201cfeeble-minded\u201d women in a variety of states didn\u2019t\nofficially end until the late 1970s and may continue covertly in some\nstate institutions. California had the highest rate of forced\nsterilizations, which were widely performed on prison inmates, people\nin mental institutions, and women considered to be bad mothers. Such\nsterilizations were motivated by both perceived individual and social\ngoods but were grounded on deep-seated prejudice as well as scientific\ninaccuracies (Kluchin 2009; Stern 2015). Concepts of\n\u201cfeeble-mindedness\u201d were historically entangled in deeply\nproblematic ways with ideas of race, class, and gender (Stubblefield\n2007). California has now joined Virginia and North Carolina in passing\nlegislation to compensate forced sterilization victims.\n\n\nLater, attempts to promote positive eugenics were\nrenewed with the creation of the Repository for Germinal Choice, a\nsperm bank created in 1978 with the idea of collecting sperm from Nobel\nlaureates, others deemed \u201cgeniuses\u201d and Olympic level\nathletes. Artificial insemination and IVF would thus allow women to\nchoose to reproduce with men presumed to have high-quality genes,\nwithout needing to form relationships with them. Although most Nobel\nprizewinners proved reluctant to donate to the sperm bank, the general\nidea took off. Today, advances in egg freezing have also permitted the\ncreation of egg banks and print and online ads in college newspapers\nregularly request sperm or eggs from donors who meet certain\nqualifications for health, intelligence, athleticism, and/or\nattractiveness. Individuals or couples who require gamete donation to\nreproduce can shop around for a donor who meets their desired criteria\n(see the entry on the\n donation and sale of human eggs and sperm). \n Importantly, these practices are not only examples of\npositive eugenics but also of negative eugenics. Racist, classist, and\nableist prejudices underlie these practices in ways that promote\nnegative eugenics by preventing or discouraging some women from\nreproducing (Roberts 1997; Daar 2018).  \n\n\nThe widespread practice of prenatal genetic\ntesting (traditionally through chorionic villus sampling or\namniocentesis in the second trimester of pregnancy, but now more\nroutinely done through non-invasive blood tests in the first trimester,\nat least as a first screen), similarly presents the opportunity for\nindividuals or couples to identify genes or genetic markers for traits\nthey prefer for their future children not to have. If prenatal testing\nidentifies an undesired gene variant, prospective parents may choose to\nabort the fetus, often with the plan to later attempt a new pregnancy.\nStudies suggest that approximately 80 to 90% of parents terminate\npregnancies identified with certain disorders (Rothschild 2005,\nBlakeley et al 2019). With the advent of preimplantation genetic\ntesting, prospective parents can choose to use IVF, and then test\nearly cells of the created embryos to identify embryos with genomic\nvariants they favor or those prefer to avoid. In this way, they\npreclude the potential need for abortion by choosing to implant only\nembryos that contain the desired genes.\n\n\nThe aim of these practices certainly appears\neugenic, though without an obviously coercive structure, and presumably\ndirected at benefiting the individual family rather than the state. The\nprofession of genetic counseling, started in the 1990s, provides\nprospective parents with detailed information about the meaning of the\ntests, and the opportunity for discussion of test results. In part due\nto concerns about eugenic overtones, genetic counseling is built on a\npolicy of \u201cnon-directiveness\u201d to ensure that the\nreproductive autonomy of prospective parents is respected. That tenet\nof genetic counseling has been challenged by scholars on grounds that\nit is impossible (Clarke 2017) and that it is undesirable (Davis 2010;\nDietz and Reynolds 2021).\n\n\nFinally, while past testing methods allowed\nidentification of chromosomal abnormalities such as Trisomy 13, Trisomy\n18, Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome), and monogenic disorders such as\nHuntington\u2019s disease, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies now\npermit an unparalleled wealth of information about fetuses\u2019 and\nembryos\u2019 genomes.  Although these technologies are not yet\nused routinely, their utility is being assessed in clinical trials.\nShould this expanded genomic information be available on prenatal\ntesting panels? Or for all prospective parents who request prenatal\ntesting? What about other additions that might be of interest to\nparticular parents, even if the genetic linkages to the particular\ntraits are less direct or even only mildly predictive: diabetes,\nobesity, or psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder or\nschizophrenia?\n\n\nMoreover, new genome editing technologies are now\nbeing used to modify sperm, eggs, and embryos. Indeed, although genome\nediting for reproductive purposes is implicitly or explicitly\nprohibited in most countries, in November 2018, Chinese researcher He\nJiankui used it to modify human embryos (Kirksey 2021). He and his team\nedited the embryos to disable a genetic pathway that HIV uses to infect\ncells. According to reports, three babies have been born from the\nedited embryos\n\n\nThese new genomic technologies could provide\nprospective parents \u2013and others \u2013 with a significant degree of\ncontrol over the characteristics of their children and the traits that\nshould and should not be promoted. Deciding how to deal with\nthem \u2013 as a society, and potentially as individual prospective\nparents \u2013 is a monumental task that calls for clarity about the\nbenefits and drawbacks of genomic testing and editing, and requires us\nto revisit the meaning of eugenics and the problems associated with\nit.\n\n\nAs this short history should make clear, past,\nstate-run, involuntary eugenic endeavors have been unjust and socially\ndisastrous. Yet advances in genomic testing and interventions continue\nto make possible practices that have eugenic features, albeit framed\ndifferently. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing, for\ninstance, are understood to enhance reproductive choice, even as they\nare clearly used by prospective parents to determine which individuals\nshould come into existence. Should they be considered eugenic\npractices? Is that necessarily morally troubling? As technological\nadvances push us to consider what genomic variants we ought to be able\nto test for, which to choose prenatally, and which to manipulate we may\nneed to reassess our current practices, explore their justifications,\nand sort through the ways in which they are eugenic and morally\nworrisome.\n2. Arguing for \u201cliberal\u201d eugenics\n2.1 Distinguishing \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d eugenics\n\n\nAdvocates of liberal or new eugenics agree that\npast eugenic practices were morally wrong and should not be repeated.\nHowever, they contend that the use of current reprogenetic technologies\ndoes not share any of the morally impermissible features of such past\neugenic programs (Silver 1997; Agar 2004; Harris 2007; Savulescu and\nKahane 2009). They argue that current practices do not involve the\nmorally troubling characteristics of their historical predecessors.\nFirst, reprogenetic technologies and practices\nare individual in nature rather than\nstate-sponsored. The intended benefit of any reprogenetic intervention\nis individual/private welfare (that of the child-to-be or of the\nfamily), rather than the welfare of the state. Second, they are\npremised on individual liberty, the freedom of\nparents to choose according to their own values and conceptions of the\ngood life. The state does not mandate contraception, sterilization,\nprenatal testing, abortion, or any other form of eugenic intervention\n(note: there are potential exceptions in which judges or states have\noffered long-term contraception such as Norplant as a condition of\nprobation related to a criminal offense or for the continued provision\nof welfare, see e.g., Dresser 1996). Rather, it allows individuals to\nchoose among a range of alternatives. Third, recognizing that\nindividual parents will often desire different things for their\noffspring, current reprogenetic technologies and practices\npresume value pluralism. This means allowing others to\nchoose in ways that we ourselves would not, in the interest of\npreserving a liberal society that is neutral about conceptions of the\ngood. The aim of a liberal eugenic program is\nto expand reproductive choices for individuals, in\ncontrast to the historical eugenic programs that clearly cut off\nreproductive options for many.\n\n\nOf course, this does not mean that no limits can\nbe imposed on people\u2019s choices. Even liberal eugenics advocates\ntypically presume that some restrictions would need\nto be in place to ensure that prospective parents could not act in ways\nclearly contrary to the interests of their future children, or in ways\nthat seem clearly vicious. As will be discussed below, disagreements\nexist about how and where those limits should be set.\n\n\nFinally, advocates of current reprogenetic\ntechnologies and practices highlight the difference between the kind\nand quality of the science underlying past and current reproductive\npolicies. Past eugenic programs relied on views of race, intelligence,\nand genetics that were, from our current perspective, \u201chopelessly\nwrong\u201d (Agar 2004: 7), while reprogenetic technologies are\ngrounded on purportedly sound scientific theories and evidence.\n\n\nFor advocates of liberal eugenics, the fundamental\ndifferences between the old and the new practices are reasons to reject\nclaims about the moral wrongness of current reprogenetic technologies.\nIn their view, what current and past eugenic practices share is the aim\nof improving our offspring, and arguably that is a morally worthy goal.\n  \n2.2 Using reprogenetic technologies\n\n\nMany theorists argue in favor of permitting\nparents to make choices about their future children\u2019s genetic make-up.\nSuch arguments run the gamut from a completely laissez-faire market\nsystem \u2013 or \u201cgenetic supermarket\u201d \u2013 of the sort\nconsidered by Robert Nozick (1974: 315) to a more highly regulated\nsystem, with controls to protect the well-being of future children as\nwell as socially valued goods (e.g., rough equality, efforts to\neliminate discrimination) that might be put at risk in a completely\nfree market environment (Buchanan et al 2000). Many also contend that\nthere is a morally relevant difference between choices aimed at\naddressing diseases and those aimed at selecting or enhancing\nnon-disease traits such as intelligence, self-confidence, height, eye\ncolor, or attractiveness. Further, while some liberal eugenics\nadvocates contend that reproductive interventions for non-disease\ntraits are permissible (Agar 2004, Green 2006), some argue that they\nare morally obligatory (Harris 2007; Savulescu 2005; Savulescu and\nKahane 2009).\n2.2.1 Addressing diseases\n\n\nLiberal eugenics arguments often start by\nrecognizing the value of treatment of disease. Disease, typically\ndefined as a negative departure from species typical functioning\n(Boorse 1975; Daniels 1994), can interfere with an individual\u2019s\nparticipation in society and/or individual flourishing. Buchanan et al.\n(2000) link disease to a reduction of opportunity, and so argue that\nprovision of medical treatment for disease is a way for the state to\npromote equality of opportunity. Parents are obliged to ensure that\ntheir children get medical treatment for diseases and can be charged\nwith negligence if they fail to do so. This obligation does not obtain\nin cases of diseases that result in relatively small negative effects\non participation (e.g., mild asthma) or where the potential benefits of\ntreatment are still somewhat uncertain or might be outweighed by the\npossible harms (e.g., some cancer treatments). Parents whose\nconceptions of the good life do not include medical treatment for\nserious diseases \u2013 as in some religious communities \u2013 are not\nallowed to impose this view on their children because the children\ndeserve the opportunity to choose to adopt those views or not when they\nare adults. Mandatory life-saving treatment of their childhood diseases\nhelps to ensure that they survive to make such decisions as adults\n(Feinberg 1980). This requirement has been the subject of some debate\n(see, e.g., DesAutels, Battin and May 1999).\n\n\nBuchanan et al. (2000) note that as technology\nadvances, theories of justice need no longer consider \u201cnatural\ninequalities\u201d to be given, or outside the scope of distribution.\nIf equality of opportunity is one of the aims of a society, then,\nprovision of certain forms of genetic intervention \u2013 including\ninterventions that determine who will be brought into\nexistence \u2013 may become owed to future people as\na matter of justice. If parents can decide between implanting an embryo\nthat carries a genetic marker associated with a serious disease \u2013 \ne.g., Tay Sachs \u2013 or an embryo without that marker, they would have\na moral obligation to choose the latter, in the name of promoting the\nhealth and well-being of the future child (impersonally, perhaps, given\nthe non-identity problem).\n\n\nLiberal eugenics advocates thus move from a\ncommonly accepted position regarding the obligation to treat serious\ndiseases in children, to a requirement for people to use genetic\ninterventions in reproduction (e.g., pre-implantation genetic testing\nor genome editing) as a way to avoid transmitting serious diseases to\none\u2019s offspring (Savulescu 2001; Agar 2004; Glover 2006; Green\n2007; Harris 2007; Savulescu and Kahane 2009).\n\n\nTo be clear, though, most liberal eugenics\nproponents do not suggest that all prospective parents would be obliged\nto seek reproductive counseling and use IVF in order to fulfill\ntheir parenting or impersonal duties (but see Savulescu and Kahane\n2009). Such a requirement would present serious ethical concerns. Given\nthe prohibitive costs and relatively low success rates of IVF\ntreatment, this kind of obligation would be overly demanding on\nprospective parents, and particularly on women. Arguably, it would also\nconstitute an infringement on people\u2019s procreative liberty.\n\n\nSimilarly, proponents contend that the obligation\nto use reprogenetics to avoid transmitting diseases to one\u2019s\noffspring does not extend to legal mandates on prenatal testing or\nabortion (or one day, genome editing). For them, such practices would\nbe consistent with the old eugenics but not with the new, liberal\nversion which values reproductive liberty (but see below for challenges\nto whether such view can be maintained consistently by at least some\nproponents of liberal eugenics).\n2.2.2 Addressing non-disease traits\n\n\n Liberal eugenics advocates recognize that\nmany prospective parents may be interested not only in addressing\nhealth-related problems in their offspring but also in selecting or\nediting non-disease related genes to improve their children\u2019s\nwellbeing. Why settle for the likelihood of normal functioning if one\ncould safely choose other traits that are likely to make a\nchild\u2019s life better?\n\n\nTwo reasons are given for the use of reprogenetic\ntechnologies in this way. First, according to some liberal eugenics\nproponents, non-disease traits such as intelligence, memory, sex, hair\nor skin color, height, or beauty affect people\u2019s wellbeing\n(Savulescu 2001; Harris 2005; Green 2007). Sometimes their effect on\nwellbeing is at least as significant as that of some diseases.  If\nso then, using reprogenetic technologies to select or edit some of\nthose traits would be morally permissible.\n\n\nSecond, as mentioned earlier, liberal eugenics\nadvocates place significant value in reproductive freedom, and they\ncontend that reprogenetic technologies can advance people\u2019s\nreproductive choices in meaningful ways (Roberston 1994; Buchanan et\nal. 2000; Savulescu 2001; Agar 2004; Harris 2007; Green 2007; Buchanan\n2011). If selecting or enhancing non-disease traits contributes to\npeople\u2019s reproductive projects, then provided that their actions\ndo not clearly and seriously harm others, they should be able to use\nreprogenetic technologies with such aims.\n\n\nLiberal eugenics proponents recognize that the\npermissibility to use reprogenetic technologies for non-disease traits\nraises significant moral concerns. For instance, obsessively focused\nprospective parents might design their children in ways that are\noverbearing or narrowly focused on a particular goal of the parents\n(Kass 2003; Sandel 2007). To avoid this problem, liberal eugenics\nadvocates propose various limits on genetic interventions for\nnon-disease traits. There is widespread agreement that interventions\nshould not harm the future child (by creating a life so miserable as to\nbe not worth living, as might be the subject of a wrongful life suit).\nBeyond that, variations include, for instance: (1) only interventions\non traits that will benefit the future children no matter what life\nplan they decide to pursue and that do not reinforce problematic social\nnorms (Agar 2004), (2) only interventions that preserve a child\u2019s right\nto an open future (Davis 2010), or (3) only interventions that preserve\nopen futures and protect some central core of our human nature (Glover\n2006), or (4) only interventions that rational people agree can be\nunderstood to be in the best interest of the child (Green 2007).\n\n\nHow might one harm a child through choosing\ngenetic traits? Perhaps by selecting for traits that clearly cause\nsignificant suffering and a typically short life span (e.g., Tay-Sachs\ndisease, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). Such constraints may seem unnecessary,\ngiven that most parents do not intentionally desire painful states for\ntheir children and would not seek to engineer them in this way. Also,\nrelatively few genetic conditions will be so inherently debilitating as\nto make life so obviously miserable that would prevent one to consider\nthat life is, on balance, a benefit.\n\n\nSome of the other constraints are more contentious\nbecause they involve decisions about lives that would be worth living\nbut have different features. For instance, it can be difficult to\ndetermine how one might ensure a child\u2019s capacity to choose from a\nvariety of life plans, or what traits would be necessary to protect a\nchild\u2019s right to an open future.\n\n\nDavis (2010) and Agar (2004) both use deafness as\na case for clarification, as such a case calls attention to the\ncontentious nature of these decisions. They both take hearing to be a\ncore human capacity, or a trait that is necessary for a wide variety of\nlife plans. Hence, they argue, engineering a child to be deaf will\nlimit that child\u2019s future options. This is not, of course, to say that\ndeaf individuals cannot live rewarding lives in which they flourish.\nIndeed, Agar recognizes that in some circumstances, lacking a capacity\nlike hearing will only lead to a small difference in relative freedom,\nand if so, then we might not have a \u201cgeneral requirement to\nreplace genetic arrangements linked with deafness\u201d (2004: 105).\nOn his view, prospective parents could engineer a child to be hearing\nbecause it would increase her real freedom but could not engineer a\nchild to be deaf. Weighing in on the now widely analyzed case of two\nDeaf women (the capital \u201cD\u201d marks membership in the\nlinguistic-cultural group of the Deaf; a small \u201cd\u201d only\nsignifies the physical state of the body) who sought out a deaf sperm\ndonor in hopes of having a deaf child (Spriggs 2002; Mundy 2002), Agar\nargues that they reduced their child\u2019s real freedom by attempting to\nensure that the child would be deaf. (Although this case did not\ninvolve reprogenetic technologies, one can easily imagine the use of\nsuch technologies to ensure the birth of a child who would be deaf.)\nDavis, too, acknowledges the claims of Deaf culture, and the reasons\nparents might prefer to have a child more like themselves, but argues\nthat deliberately trying to conceive a child who will have relatively\nlimited options \u2013 limited, in her view, not just due to enduring\ndiscrimination and social constraints, but also to bodily\ndeficits \u2013 is morally impermissible.\n\n\nConstraints on parental reproductive decisions\nabout what traits to choose can also be seen as conflicting with\nreproductive freedom and parental autonomy. For instance, Green\n(2007) rejects the \u201cright to an open future\u201d language in\npart because he thinks parents must be allowed to do things that are\nmore for their own interests than for the sake of their children, even\nwhen doing so affects how the children develop. Following William\nRuddick (2007), he thinks of parents as both guardians and\ngardeners \u2013 protecting their children so that they can grow as they\nwill, but also shaping how they grow in line with\nthe parents\u2019 hopes. Because he thinks \u201cparental love almost\nalways prevails\u201d (Green, 2007: 114) \u2013 when we are faced with\nan actual child of ours, we will (typically) love the child, regardless\nof the child\u2019s traits \u2013 he finds it morally acceptable that\nparents might want to choose traits for their children that do not\nstrictly speaking preserve an open future. If parents want a child with\na good shot at an athletic career, for instance, why not allow them to\nengineer for athleticism or great vision? Doing\nso might narrow other life opportunities, but not to\nthe extent that the child couldn\u2019t choose how her life goes. Her future\nwould still be open enough. Green emphasizes parental reproductive\nautonomy, and the continuum between shaping the future possibilities\nfor our existing children through parental values, education, religion,\nand more, and doing so through genetic interventions. His central\nrecommendation is that genetic interventions should be aimed at what\nis reasonably in the child\u2019s best interests (2007:\n216), recognizing that the parents\u2019 own interests are also relevant. By\n\u201creasonably\u201d he means that it is not enough for parents\nto think that something is in their child\u2019s best\ninterests; their judgment must accord with that of most other informed\nmembers of society (2007: 216). Once that condition is satisfied,\nparents would be permitted to choose, according to their own tastes and\npreferences, within a wide range of options of relatively\n\u201call-purpose\u201d traits (2007: 218). Just who the\n\u201cinformed\u201d members of society are, is of course, a matter\nof some contention (for discussion, see Hayry 2010).\n\n\nIn sum, theorists who argue for the permissibility\nof using reprogenetic technologies and practices for disease and\nnon-disease traits seek to preserve parental reproductive autonomy and\nto expand rather than reduce parental options. At the same time, they\nemphasize the need to increase the future child\u2019s options, so long as\ndoing so does not reinforce unjust social prejudices or threaten deeply\nheld core values. One problem with this thesis, to be explored more in\ndepth below in the section on critiques, is the appropriate scope of\nits central claims. Some critics (e.g., Asch 2000; Saxton 2000; Sparrow\n2005), for instance, suggest that it fails to recognize that many of\nthe presumptions about social prejudice could be extended to prejudice\nagainst people with certain diseases and disabilities, many of whom\nlive relatively well with traits or characteristics that genetic\nenhancers may well desire to eliminate or attempt to improve upon. If\nwe ought not collude with and exacerbate the social prejudices of\nsexism and racism through our reproductive genetic choices, why is\ndoing the same for ableist norms permissible?\n2.2.3 Morally permissible or obligatory?\n\n\nBut are parental choices regarding non-disease\ntraits simply morally permissible or are they morally obligatory? While\nadvocates of liberal eugenics agree on the obligation to address\ndisease-related genomic variants, they disagree regarding whether the\nuse of reprogenetic technologies for non-disease traits is a matter of\nmoral permissibility or obligation. For some proponents, it is morally\npermissible, but not obligatory, for parents to use (with some\nconstraints) reprogenetic technologies to select or edit non-disease\ntraits (Agar 2004; Green 2007). They reject the moral obligatoriness of\nthese practices for several reasons. First, there is the difficulty of\ndetermining just what counts as an improvement (beyond addressing\nserious disease). For instance, Agar (2004) questions whether it is\nobviously better for a child to be highly intelligent (roughly\napproximated by a likely IQ of 160). Might some parents reasonably\nchoose a more moderate level of intelligence for a child, presuming the\nchild will have greater social opportunities in the latter case?\nPerhaps the overall freedom of the child of moderate intelligence will\nbe greater than that of the child with high intelligence, even though\non that one dimension the child\u2019s capacities are comparatively\nlower. Second, while one might consider it reasonable to incur risks of\nreprogenetic intervention to treat or prevent diseases, it is by no\nmeans clear that the risk-benefit balance would be appropriate when\ndealing with non-medical traits.  Third, many recognize the\nimportance and value of diversity (Green 2007). Given the many ways in\nwhich parents can attempt to improve the lives of their children, it is\nnot clear why there would be a moral obligation to choose some\nnon-disease traits over others rather than simply allowing parents to\nchoose what they wish. Additionally, even if many people agree on the\nvalue of some non-disease characteristic and it becomes so common that\nits possession is practically required for equal participation in\nsociety, we might want to resist the temptation to make that\nintervention obligatory. For example, Agar (2004: 85)\nsuggests this might happen with the trait \u201cbeing somewhat happier\nthan is now normal\u201d if treatment tied to 5-HTTLPR, a genetic\nmarker associated with upbeat temperament, became common. The\nnow-typical temperament is not a disease, but a mere variety within the\ncapacious normal range of functioning and would likely remain so even\nin a future society of 5-HTTLPR-enhanced people.\nA liberal eugenics cannot mandate any one view of\nthe good life for its citizens.\n\n\nOther proponents (Harris, 2002, 2007; Savulescu\n2005; Savulescu and Kahane 2009) recognize the potential benefits of\ngenetic enhancement, and forthrightly argue in favor of moral\nobligations to pursue them. Some such enhancements might be relatively\nminor, while others might be radical enough to eventually create a new\nspecies (Glover 2006).\n\n\nEarly work by Savulescu (2001), for instance,\nargues that parents have an obligation to produce the best children\npossible. This obligation cannot be owed to any particular child (given\nthe non-identity problem), but is an impersonal obligation, to make the\nworld a better place. If parents are using pre-implantation genetic\ndiagnosis, they should always choose the embryo with the best chances\nat the best life. Non-disease traits, as mentioned earlier, can have\nsignificant effects on how well people\u2019s lives go. Savulescu\nimagines that the rational parent could make no other decision but to\navoid the negative linkages and promote the positive ones, where\npossible.\n\n\nBut this obligation is a moral one. Thus, the\nstate need not (indeed, should not) legally coerce parents to select or\nedit their offspring to produce the best children they can have\n(Savulescu 2001). To the contrary, the state must balance the benefits\nof potential enforcement against its existing obligations to protect\nreproductive liberties. Nonetheless, the state might have good reason\nto encourage parents to take such action, through education and\npersuasive public health campaigns (not unlike anti-smoking campaigns).\nOn this stronger view, others, too, would be right to express\ndisapproval (Savulescu and Kahane 2009)\n\n\nA similar position is advocated by Harris (2007).\nAlthough the arguments are about a moral obligation, these liberal\neugenics advocates recognize that other competing priorities (e.g.,\nautonomy of parents, welfare of other siblings, harm to others) could\npotentially trump this obligation.\n\n\nFor other liberal eugenics advocates the moral\nobligation to select or edit non-disease traits is grounded on social\nbenefits. For instance, Buchanan (2011) is broadly optimistic\nabout biomedical enhancement technologies \u2013 seeing them as not\nsignificantly unlike other enhancing societal innovations, such as\nliteracy, numeracy and agriculture \u2013  and argues in favor of\nfunding research and development into a broad array of enhancements.\nDoing so will be socially good: good for economic growth to avoid\nproblems of illiteracy, sickness, etc. that can accompany, for\ninstance, lower intelligence and merely typical immune systems.\n\n\nOther theorists likewise offer social benefit\njustifications for genetic enhancement. Elster (2011) advocates a\nprinciple of general procreative beneficence, changing the last part of\nSavulescu\u2019s PPB to an obligation to produce the best child, of those\npossible, \u201cwhose life will maximize the expected overall value in\nthe world.\u201d (2011: 483). Rather than focus on individual welfare,\nhe recommends a system of obligations that starts from general social\ngoods. Parents considering reproduction are then bound by a maximizing\nduty to the world.\n\n\nAlthough Savulescu highlights the well-being of\nthe individual in his work on procreative beneficence, in more recent\nwork, the obligation to produce the best seems to have shifted from an\nobligation to improve the world by privately producing the best\nindividuals, to an obligation to improve the world by producing\nindividuals who will help to solve social problems. For instance, in\ntheir book Unfit for the Future (2012), Persson and Savulescu\nargue that we are obligated to fund and explore moral\nbioenhancement (2012: 2) \u2013 the idea that we could\ngenetically or pharmacologically enhance our moral motivation, to\nreduce selfishness and aggression, and increase our sense of fairness,\naltruism, and our willingness to cooperate (see also Douglas 2008).\nGiven the massive threats to human well-being presented by global\nclimate change and the abundance of weapons of mass\ndestruction \u2013 and the fact that solutions to these large-scale\nproblems will require collective action to prevent future\nproblems \u2013 Persson and Savulescu claim that traditional methods of\nmoral change (e.g., education, public campaigns) are unlikely to be\neffective. If we care about the planet \u2013 and we should \u2013 then\nwe are obligated to invest in moral bioenhancement research, and\npresumably ensure that if successful, it gets wide uptake (Persson and\nSavulescu 2012). Buchanan (2011) is sympathetic, noting that critics\nwho worry about whether we will use this technology wisely may be\nshort-sighted.\n\n\nThis suggestion\nabout moral bioenhancement has sparked criticism\nfocused on threats to human freedom (Harris 2011; Simkulet 2013), the\nmeaning of being virtuous (Kabasenche 2013; Levin 2021), the complexity\nof human moral psychology (Zarpentine 2011), and the complexities of\nhuman biology (Wiseman 2016, Levin 2021).\n3. Criticisms of \u201cliberal\u201d eugenics\n\n\nGiven the historical horrors associated with\neugenics, it should be unsurprising that criticisms of liberal eugenics\n\u2013 whether regarding permission or obligation \u2013 are numerous and\nvaried. Proponents have tried to address some of those criticisms in\nmore or less convincing ways. In this section, we discuss some of the\nmost significant criticisms that have been presented against liberal\neugenics.\n\n\nSome critics point out the difficulty of making\nmeaningful comparisons about what is the \u201cbest\u201d life (de\nMelo Martin 2004; Parker 2007).  Other theorists \u2013 attentive\nto pervasive unjust discrimination in respect to sexism, racism,\nclassism, and heterosexism \u2013 emphasize the broadly negative\nconsequences of promoting or allowing liberal eugenic policies, given\nthe aggregation of many individual choices, and the slippery slope to\nan older style of coercive eugenics (Duster 1990; Sparrow 2011a). When\nsome parents insist that eliminating a trait will increase their\nchild\u2019s relative freedom and the group of people who live with that\ntrait point to the ways in which that choice contributes to and\nreinforces social prejudice against their group (Lane and Grodin 1997;\nSaxton 2000; Asch 2000; Kaposy 2018), how are we to proceed with the\nregulation of \u201cliberal\u201d eugenics?  Other critics call\nattention to the problematic conceptions of disability that underlie\nmany of the arguments as well as the negative effects liberal eugenics\nis likely to have on existing people with disabilities (Asch 1999;\nSaxton 2000; Amundson 2005). Still other critics highlight potential\ndamage to some core values, such as our conception of ourselves\n(Habermas 2003), what it means to be human (Sandel 2007; Kass 2003),\nand the parent-child relationship. When parents attempt to design their\nchildren, critics argue, they demonstrate a lack of humility in the\nface of nature, and more specifically, an attempt to control where they\nshould instead appreciate what is given (Sandel 2007; Kass 2003).\n3.1 The comparison problem\n\n\nThe reproductive choices that prospective parents are encouraged\n\u2013 or morally required \u2013 to make regarding their offspring are\nchoices about selecting or enhancing their children or selecting the\nbest they can have. All involve comparisons about traits that\ncontribute to better or worse lives. But deciding which traits are\npositive, and of those, which are better than others, is a task far\nfrom simple. Critics point to the difficulty of ranking the expected\nwell-being of future possible lives, given 1) disagreements about what\ntraits are positive and negative, and the need to contextualize such\ntraits in a particular environmental or societal context or family\nsituation, and 2) the reality that most embryos will have a complex\nmixture of positive and negative traits making meaningful pairwise\ncomparisons very difficult (de Melo Martin 2004; 2017; Parker\n2007).\n\n\nSavulescu and Kahane have tried to reply to these\nconcerns in various ways. For instance, they have argued that critics\nare overstating their case and that we do this kind of ranking all the\ntime when we make decisions about bringing up and educating our\nchildren. Ordinary morality, they argue, already asks parents to make\nthese comparisons (Savulescu and Kahane 2009).\n\n\nBut it is far from obvious that this is the case\n(de Melo-Martin 2017). Clearly, common morality requires that\nprospective parents care about their children\u2019s wellbeing, not\nthat they maximize it. Moreover, in ordinary life, parents are not\nrequired to choose between child A and child B in virtue of which one\nis more likely to have the best life. Rather, when prospective parents\nmake decisions that are likely to have an impact on their\nchildren\u2019s welfare, such decisions involve comparisons between\nthe life of a child if one does A or if one does B (e.g., if one\npromotes music training or sports).\n\n\nSavulescu and Kahane (2009) also contend that in\ncomplex cases where different forms of life might be equally good or\nthat are likely to contain incomparable forms of well-being,\nprospective parents choosing the child whose life can be expected to go\nbest are free to choose any of the available options.\n\n\nWhile this response suggests some greater\nflexibility in their view than might be apparent from the language of\nobligation, they do not always seem consistent in advocating for this\nflexibility (Sparrow 2007). Moreover, how will\nwe know when different forms of life are equally\ngood or when the associated well-being is incomparable?\n\n\nRather than giving a substantive account of\nwell-being (they argue that their account is compatible with several\ntheories of wellbeing such as hedonism, desire-fulfillment accounts,\nand objective list theories), Savulescu and Kahane simply assert\nconfidence that we will be able to find an agreeable one. They offer\nsimple examples to illustrate their view. Mild asthma, though only a\nminor impediment to well-being, is nonetheless not acceptable to choose\nif we have the information and an alternative embryo without the mild\nasthma. Deafness is clearly a detriment to well-being \u2013 at least in\nthis society \u2013 and so should not be selected. They are careful to\nadd that their view can appreciate deafness and recognize that it is\nclearly compatible with a good, even flourishing\nlife. But a life without asthma or deafness, they submit, would\nclearly be better. Our obligation is to produce the best, not\njust a life compatible with flourishing. They thus see the need for two\nsteps: finding a reasonable theoretical model of well-being, and then\ninvestigating whether a particular trait or condition is, on balance, a\ndetriment to overall well-being on that view.\n\n\nDespite their confidence, there is reason to think\nthere will be significant disagreement in both steps. A theory of\nwell-being that is acceptable to most might be so abstract as to fail\nto offer any significant help, and then the matter of determining how\ntraits or conditions in question are related to expected\nwell-being \u2013 such that we can do a comparison and select the\nbest \u2013 will be even more difficult (Parker 2007). Parents who see\nvalue in a wide variety of ways of being in the world \u2013 both for\nthe individual, and for society as a whole \u2013 may welcome children\nwho have traits that are not standardly considered advantageous.\nConsider, for instance, positive accounts about raising children with\nDown syndrome (Berube 1998; Estreich 2011; Kaposy 2018), and even\nprofound cognitive and physical disability (Kittay 1999). Indeed, as\nSparrow (2007) has pointed out, on any of the accounts of wellbeing\nthat Savulescu and Kahane consider, their proposal to choose the best\nchild will turn out to have either counterintuitive or incoherent\nresults. For instance, prospective parents who have a hedonist\nconception of wellbeing would be justified in choosing \u2013indeed\nobligated to do so \u2013 the child whose brain chemistry is more likely to\ncause feelings of pleasure. Similarly, on a desire-fulfillment account,\nparents would have reasons to choose children who will grow up to have\nless ambition or curiosity as their preferences will be more likely\nsatisfied, and thus would have better lives.\n3.2 The promoting injustice problem\n\n\nOne of the most serious challenges to liberal\neugenics is the concern that promoting \u2013and more so\nrequiring \u2013 these practices will contribute to social\ninjustices. Indeed, the past use of eugenic policies provides\ngood reasons for these worries.\n\n\nThe use of reprogenetic technologies to select or\nedit embryos can contribute to social injustices in various ways. For\ninstance, given the significant costs of these technologies, its use is\nlikely to increase inequalities between people who have the finances to\nafford them, and those who do not. The wealthy already have advantages;\nif we allow them to select or edit their offspring for improvements\n \u2013 so that they are smarter, faster, stronger, with less need to\nsleep, etc. \u2013 those children will be ever more competitive, and\nliable to increase the divide between rich and poor. (Lee Silver\nexplores this dystopian possibility with the GenRich and the Naturals\nin his Remaking Eden, 1997, though he still supports the use\nof these technologies.)\n\n\nProponents of liberal eugenics have offer several\nresponses to this concern. Some contend that these technologies will\neventually become widely available and thus, that the critics\u2019\nworries are overstated. For example, Green (2007) notes that all\ninnovations have a period of diffusion, during which early adopters pay\nhigher prices and take some risks for the potential of leading the way\nforward, and then, if the technology is successful, prices drop and the\nwider public gains access through the market. Similarly, Buchanan\n(2011) compares genetic intervention to literacy, numeracy, and\nagriculture, and argues that these innovations too were only available\nto a few at the start, but then became broadly accessible.\n\n\nFor others this problem would be avoided by\nensuring that the technologies are available to everyone, at least for\ntraits that offer significant advantages (Buchanan 2011). Traits that\nonly offer positional advantages \u2013 being taller than, perhaps\nfaster than \u2013 would then be self-defeating (Buchanan et al. 2000)\nif available to all, and the allure might fade. Other\ntraits \u2013 perhaps enhanced concentration, memory, or\nimmunity \u2013 might be advantageous regardless of how many people have\nthem. Providing funding to improve accessibility would then be\nnecessary in order to ensure fairness.\n\n\nOf course, whether these responses assuage\nconcerns about increasing inequality depends on their feasibility. We\nhave at least some reasons not to be very hopeful in such regard. \nAfter all, technologies such as IVF have been around for several\ndecades, and though more people now have access to them, they are far\nfrom being cheap technologies, accessible to everyone who wishes to use\nthem. Also, given the many serious problems our society faces,\nprioritizing access to these technologies rather than using resources\nfor something else that would be more cost-effective would require\njustification.\n\n\nAnother way in which the use of reprogenetic\ntechnologies to select or edit embryos can contribute to social\ninjustices is related not to access but to the kinds of values that are\nlikely to guide parental choices. Critics highlight the troubling\naggregate effect of individual choices, particularly when they are\noften ill-informed or relatively biased (de Melo Martin 2004; Goering\n2000). They call attention to the deeply entrenched social injustices\nthat pervade many societies, and that would typically inform individual\nfree choices. Tremain (2006) discusses this effect in relation to\ndisability. Russell (2010) argues that taking race to be a morally\nneutral feature (as Harris does) is only a \u201cveiled attempt\u201d\nto distinguish contemporary from historical eugenics practices. Perhaps\nrace should be morally neutral, but it is not commonly treated as such,\nand opening up \u201cchoice\u201d for people who harbor explicit or\nimplicit biases related to race allows for those biases to shape the\nnext generation. Oliver (2010) likewise highlights the trick of\nlabeling gender a morally neutral category in a world filled with\nsexism, and also rightly emphasizes the levels of surveillance and\ncontrol over women that are likely to follow the implementation of\nliberal eugenics. The unintended negative effects on pregnant women of\nincreased attention to prenatal testing and surveillance of pregnancy\ngenerally are explored in Katz Rothman (1986), Rapp (1999), and Kukla\n(2008), but tend to be ignored by liberal eugenics advocates (Oliver\n2010; de Melo-Martin 2017). (See also the entry on \n pregnancy, birth and medicine).\n\n\nLiberal eugenics proponents are generally\nsympathetic to these concerns \u2013indeed, some of them, have\nexplored directly issues related to collective action problems (Anomaly\n2020) \u2013 and have tried to respond to them. Some argue for constraints\non the types of traits that parents should be allowed to select or edit\n(Agar 2004; Green 2007). Some characteristics, e.g., homosexuality,\ndark skin, will only be harmful to the individual in a morally\ndefective social environment. What is needed in such a case, proponents\nargue, is to change attitudes and social practices instead of\npeople\u2019s genomes. For instance, Agar acknowledges that it would\nbe preferable to eliminate racism (2004: 155), but given how entrenched\nit is in many societies, he considers whether we might want to allow\nsome genetic interventions (e.g., engineering lighter skin tone) that\ncould help individuals avoid suffering from it. On this view, the use\nof reprogenetic technologies to select or edit certain traits could be\nhelpful at least in the short term, as it would help reduce some\nnear-term suffering, and the social solutions are distant and rather\nunlikely. Ultimately, however, he claims that we should not allow this\nkind of genetic engineering \u2013 not simply because it seems to\ncollude with a morally defective social environment, but because it\nreinforces and perhaps exacerbates that environment (it undermines work\ntoward changing the morally defective social environment) (2004:\n156\u2013157). Liberal states remain neutral about what constitutes\nthe good life, but impose certain restrictions (laws, policies) and\noffer education or aid (public health campaigns, food stamps) in the\nname of ensuring that citizens are safe, relatively stable, and have\nequal opportunity to pursue their goals.\n\n\nCritics, however, fear that regulations put in\nplace by advocates \u2013 whether in the form of laws, restrictions of\nthe use of federal or state funds, or mere recommendations or\nguidelines from medical societies \u2013 will not be sufficient to avoid\nthe negative consequences of eugenic practices (Duster 1990; Sparrow\n2011a). They point out the many ways that a collection of individual\nchoices, pressured by unjust social norms and assumptions, may lead to\nresults not wholly unlike those of the old eugenics programs.\n\n\nGreen (2007) also recommends against interventions\nthat would reinforce or increase discrimination, economic inequality,\nor racism (2007: 216\u2013226), but he does so with some reservations.\nParents understandably might want to reduce social burdens on their\nchildren through genetic interventions, he believes, and if we make\ndoing so illegal, they will likely go elsewhere or underground to get\nwhat they want. He also \u2013 optimistically \u2013 suggests that\nstereotypes and fashions ebb and flow and may be self-corrective (2007:\n227). Groups who have experienced significant discrimination over many\ngenerations will understandably reject such optimism. Indeed, the\ninsufficient progress made against these social ills and the historical\nevidence arguably calls for all of us to be skeptical of this\noptimism.\n\n\nSome have denied that social injustice could\nresult from selecting or editing for particular traits that increase\npeople\u2019s chances at a better life (Savulescu 2001). To the extent\nthat those traits contribute to inequality, the argument goes, it is\nunlikely that they could promote wellbeing (Savulescu 2001, 424). This\nclaim seems, however, either irrelevant or false (de Melo-Martin 2017).\nProspective parents choosing certain traits for their children could do\nso without realizing that they are actually undermining their\nchildren\u2019s wellbeing (see Anomaly 2020, a proponent of liberal\neugenics, who explicitly acknowledges coordination problems resulting\nfrom prospective parents\u2019 choices \u2013 although he does not\ndiscuss choices that might increase sexism or racism). For instance, in\na sexist society where parents systematically select for boys, it might\nbe the case that the wellbeing of those boys could diminish because of\nthe effects in society of fewer females. However, parents will realize\nthis only once the choices contributing to injustice have already been\nmade. But quite likely the claim is simply false. Consider racists\nsocieties. It is implausible that the selection of fair-skinned\nchildren in such societies would ever contribute to either a decrease\nin wellbeing for fair-skinned selected children or a decrease in social\ninjustices against those with darker skin (Sparrow 2007).\n\n\nIn some cases, liberal eugenics proponents simply\nbite the bullet and argue that social injustices should be addressed by\nchanging the social context rather than by constraining peoples\u2019\nreproductive choices (Savulescu 2001; Harris 2007; Savulescu and Kahane\n2009). For them, prospective parents have a moral requirement to\ncreate the best child even if doing so results in social\ninjustice. Savulescu and Kahane, for example, maintain that\nrestricting access to reprogenetic interventions regarding sex,\nsexuality, or skin color, in order to ensure that unjust norms are not\npromoted is not justified. Indeed, Savulescu explicitly maintains that\nprospective parents have a moral obligation to select the best child,\neven if doing so increases social injustices (Savulescu 2001). For\nthese proponents, society should address the unfair treatment of\nvarious groups, but they believe it should not be done through\nregulation of reproductive decision-making. Reproduction should not\nbecome an instrument of social change, at least not mediated or\nmotivated at a social level.\n3.3 The inconsistency problem\n\n\nRecall that proponents of liberal eugenics argue\nthat insofar as the choice of whether and how to use reprogenetic\ntechnologies is left up to individuals, these practices do not involve\nthe immoral characteristics of their historical predecessors. Critics\nhowever have been highly skeptical that liberal eugenics proposals can\nescape the charge of being problematically eugenic. For instance,\nBennett (2008) notes that an obligation to bring to birth the best\nchildren possible can only be established by placing a lower moral\nvalue on people with disabilities and that this obligation strongly\nargues for the introduction of eugenic policies.\n\n\nKoch (2011) highlights similarities to past\neugenic policies and accuses the central theorists of hubris \u2013 even\na \u201chuckster\u2019s promise\u201d (p. 199) \u2013 in presuming not only\nthat we will be able to engineer complex traits like intelligence, but\nthat they can know the appropriate regulatory limits and speak for all\nparents. In fact, the title of one of Persson and Savulescu\u2019s\nbook \u2013 Unfit for the Future (2012) \u2013 combined\nwith its thesis regarding the need for tightened controls on liberal\nsocieties to preserve human security, makes comparisons to eugenicists\nideas about unworthy lives unavoidable. (For a chilling review of\nPersson and Savulescu\u2019s book, see Munsterhjelm 2011).\n\n\nButtressing these concerns, critics have also\ncalled attention to other potentially troubling assumptions in the\ntheoretical framework of liberal eugenics that undermine claims about\nthe differences with the old eugenics. Bennett (2008), for instance,\ncontends that an appeal to impersonal or non-person-affecting harm\ncannot get supporters of liberal eugenics out of the non-identity\nproblem without resorting to troubling social justifications. Insofar\nas the liberal eugenic project is not interested in the welfare of\nparticular people but in producing what liberal eugenicists believe is\nthe best world possible, it is difficult to see the differences with\nthe old eugenics which aimed at promoting social and not personal\ngoods.\n\n\nSo, even though advocates of liberal eugenics\nclaim to value people equally (while acknowledging that their lives can\ngo better or worse), this does not square with the idea of some worlds\nbeing morally preferable simply because they do not\ncontain people with even mild disabilities or other presumably\nundesirable traits.\n\n\nSimilarly, Sparrow (2011a) points out the profound\ntension between the consequentialist justifications favored by liberal\neugenics advocates and their assurances about the preservation of\nreproductive liberties. For example, taking Savulescu to task, Sparrow\ndraws attention to the fact that in order to address concerns about\ncolluding with unjust social norms \u2013 which Savulescu does by\nadmitting that in certain cases parents ought not choose the\n\u201cbest\u201d child for their social environment, given sexism,\nracism, etc. \u2013 Savulescu must revert to attending to social\nconsequences, rather than individual welfare.  But, this would\ncommit proponents to sacrifice the well-being of individuals for the\nsake of social goals (2011a: 35\u201336). At a minimum, this calls for\nsome justification about what social goods would trump the reproductive\nchoices of individual prospective parents and about who should be\nmaking those decisions.\n\n\nSparrow also questions the justification for the\nassumption that parents ought to have the best\nchild they could have. If we are morally obligated\nto produce the best, and if any embryos we can produce are not likely\nto rank very high relative to those of others, wouldn\u2019t there also be\nan obligation to use a donated embryo (or a clone\nof the embryo that is the best)\n(Sparrow 2011a)? To be fair, Savulescu argues that other moral reasons\ncan trump prospective parents\u2019 moral obligations to choose the\nbest child, and some degree of reproductive autonomy will surely fit\nthere. Nonetheless, the tension between parental choices and\nconsequentialist demands is difficult to escape. Moreover, as Sparrow\npoints out, even if advocates of an obligation to enhance \u2013 like\nSavulescu and Harris \u2013 deny any requirement for the government to\ncoerce individuals to participate in genetic interventions for the sake\nof enhancement, governments might still be obligated to implement\npolicies that are not strictly coercive, e.g., systems of incentives\nand targeted health campaigns. Doing so would be a form of\nstate-sponsored control \u2013 even if only through non-coercive\npressure \u2013 of reproduction, and thus much more like troubling\nold-style eugenics.\n\n\nLiberal eugenics proponents, particularly those\nwho argue for a moral obligation to use reprogenetic technologies to\nimprove our offspring, also have difficulties responding to concerns\nabout the ways in which societal norms can lead toward homogeneity,\neven without state-sponsored programs. Parents who are free to choose\ncharacteristics for their offspring may be inclined to choose\nsimilarly, either because they agree (perhaps wrongly) that those\ncharacteristics are better, or because they worry their child will be\nat a substantial disadvantage relative to other children if they choose\nwhat is unpopular (or simply fail to intervene to ensure what is\npopular). If so, societal pressures on parental choices will have\neffects similar to policies enforced by a state \u2013 homogeneity of\ntraits selected across the population (Duster 1990).   \n\n\nIndeed, some liberal eugenics proponents, aware of\nthis concern, are willing to defend restrictions on parental\nreproductive freedom (Agar 2004). But here again, such restrictions are\nproposed in the name of ensuring a social good. Thus advocates of\nliberal eugenics face a dilemma: if parents should be the ones\ndetermining the future well-being of their children, then they will\nlikely choose in ways that a) some liberals find counter-intuitive,\ni.e., choosing a Deaf child, and b) may, through market pressures and\nsocial norms, lead to homogeneity from \u201ctyranny of the\nmajority\u201d (Sparrow 2011b: 515). If, on the other hand, parents\nshould not have this leeway, if some restrictions prevent them from\nchoosing in certain ways, then reproductive decisions about improving\nour offspring fall in the hands of the state. While, as mentioned\nearlier, most advocates of liberal eugenics express concern about the\nproblem of aggregate effects of individual choices, they often end up\nseeming to dismiss them (Green 2007), presuming that education or other\nmodes of dealing with the problems will be sufficient (Savulescu 2001),\nor just adding a qualification about the need to avoid reinforcing\nunjust social norms (Agar 2004), without fully exploring the difficulty\nof doing so.\n3.4 Disability rights critiques\n\n\nCommon among liberal eugenic proponents is the\nassumption that disability is a bad state. Selecting or editing against\ndisability is thus understood as what parents who care about their\nchildren\u2019s wellbeing ought to do. In response, the disability\ncommunity has presented strong arguments against liberal eugenics. The\ndisability rights critique of the \u201cnew\u201d eugenics takes on\ncurrent practices such as prenatal testing and PGT and selective\nabortion or destruction of embryos, as well as options such as gene\nediting.\n3.4.1 The expressivist argument\n\n\nIn what is known as the expressivist\nargument, disability theorists have argued that screening\nembryos or fetuses followed by destruction of the embryos or abortion\nof fetuses sends a negative message \u2013 \u201cIt is better not to\nexist than to have a disability\u201d (Saxton 2000), \u201cWe do not\nwant any more like you\u201d (Wendell 1996) \u2013 to existing people\nwith disabilities, particularly those living with disabilities for\nwhich testing is routinely done. The negative message is harmful and\nmight be considered a form of discrimination.\n\n\nThe expressivist argument highlights the ways in\nwhich prenatal testing feels threatening to people with disabilities\nand their allies/advocates. As Parens and Asch point out,\n\n\nIf one thinks for even a moment about the history\nof our society\u2019s treatment of people with disabilities, it is not\ndifficult to appreciate why people identified with the disability\nrights movement might regard such testing as dangerous. \u2026 living\nwith disabling traits need not be detrimental either to an individual\u2019s\nprospects of leading a worthwhile life, or to the families in which\nthey grow up, or to society at large. (2000: 4).\n\n\nThe expressivist argument is often defended by\ntheorists who are staunchly pro-choice about abortion; they typically\ndefend a woman\u2019s legal right to choose abortion for any reason but\npresent a moral argument against particular reasons for selective\nabortion. In making this distinction, they rely on the\n\u201cany/particular\u201d distinction proposed by Asch (2000): a\nwoman who does not want any child because she is not\nready to be a mother is different from one who is eager to be a mother\nbut then rejects this particular fetus or embryo, based on screening. A\ndifferent version of the expressivist argument looks beyond the\nindividual act of testing to focus on the\nsocial offer of prenatal testing, particularly in a\nsociety where it has become routinized, to consider the negative\nevaluation it expresses about the lives of existing people with\ndisabilities (Press 2000).\n\n\nObjections have been raised regarding the meaning\nof such \u201cexpressions\u201d (see, for instance, Buchanan 1996;\nNelson 2000), and the necessity of the negative message (Baily 2000;\nMcMahan 2005), as well as the relative moral significance of the\nmessage even if it is negative and expressed (Edwards 2004). Many\ntheorists emphasize that one can value the person with a disability,\nwhile devaluing the disability (Savulescu 2001; Glover 2006; McMahan\n2005). Glover (2006), for instance, is careful to note that we should\nbe very clear about expressing support for existing people with\ndisabilities even as we seek prenatal testing or other genetic\ninterventions.\n\n\nSuch distinction, however, can be difficult to\naccept for individuals who experience their disability as a central\npart of their identity (for discussion, see Wendell 1996; Saxton 2000;\nEdwards 2004). Furthermore, as Holm (2007) notes, even if we could\nconceptually separate prenatal testing from the disrespectful and\ndiscriminatory messages about people with disabilities, that does not\nmean they aren\u2019t deeply intertwined in current screening practices.\n\n\nSome disability rights advocates reject the\nexpressivist argument and are more concerned with the fairness and\ncompleteness of the information provided in the context of prenatal\ntesting than in the practice as a whole (Shakespeare 2006; Klein 2011;\nKaposy 2018). These advocates call attention to the attitudes,\npractices, education, and research of professionals involved in\nadministering prenatal testing and the prejudices rampant in our\nsociety against people with disabilities. They evince a disregard for\nthe experiences of disability as well as an ignorance of disability\nissues. The biases against people with disabilities that underly\ndecisions about selective abortion threaten the wellbeing of those with\ndisabilities.\n\n\nKaposy\u2019s book, Choosing Down\nSyndrome, for example, presents an extended argument for the\nposition that people with Down Syndrome can and often do have good\nlives, full of the wide variety of joys and sorrows attendant to being\nhuman. As he notes early on, the genetic realities (i.e., what is\navailable during prenatal testing) of Down Syndrome don\u2019t tell\nthe whole story.\n\n\nHe worries that expanded use of non-invasive first\ntrimester tests may ultimately increase the number of abortions of\nfetuses with Trisomy 21 and with it, further threaten the wellbeing of\npeople with Down Syndrome. But rather than arguing that people should\nnot selectively abort fetuses with Trisomy 21, pro-choice\nKaposy argues for a more capacious understanding of how good life can\nbe and why choosing to continue pregnancy after such a\ndiagnosis is perfectly reasonable. Indeed, if more people chose to have\nchildren with Down syndrome this would counter the prevalence of\nharmful prejudices. His key concern is that much of the impetus to\nabort following a prenatal diagnosis comes from misinformation, faulty\ninferences, and biases that people might disavow if they were made\naware of them. He offers his book as a way to increase the\n\u201csocial fund of knowledge.\u201d\n3.4.2 The meaning of disability\n\n\nPart of what concerns disability rights advocates\nis the questionable relation between the existence of certain\nimpairments or bodily anomalies and the availability of equality of\nopportunity or well-being (Silvers, Wasserman, and Mahowald 1998;\nAmundson 2005; Asch and Wasserman 2005) that seems to be a common\npresumption in liberal eugenics theories. Broadly, they worry that many\nof these theorists are relatively uninformed about the life experiences\nof people with disabilities, or unfairly dismissive of their claims\n(Amundson 2005; Goering 2008), and thus rely on an overly negative\nevaluation of their quality of life. As such, efforts to promote\n\u201cgood birth\u201d often undervalue existing people with\ndisabilities. Additionally, advocates of liberal eugenics, it is\nargued, allow one trait to stand in for all of what a potential person\ncan be (Asch and Wasserman 2005), and underestimate the value of human\ndiversity that includes non-standard modes of human functioning linked\nto disability (Silvers 1998; Garland-Thomson 2012), and the possibility\nof \u201cgains\u201d made possible through living with disability\n(Baumrin and Murray 2014). (For more discussion, see entries on \n disability: definitions and models; \n and \n feminist perspectives on disability.)\n\n\nAt least some liberal eugenic advocates are aware\nof this concern and have explored the possibility that our current\nsocial norms might be \u201cmorally defective\u201d in respect to\ndisability. For instance, Glover defends the permissibility of parental\nchoice within some limits, but he investigates just what counts as a\ndisability. He proposes that a disability involves a functional\nlimitation that \u201cimpairs the capacity for human\nflourishing\u201d (2006: 9), either by itself or in conjunction with\nsocial disadvantage. Thus, although racism results in social\ndisadvantage, having dark skin is not itself a disability, because it\nhas no associated functional limitation. Some conditions previously\nconsidered disabilities \u2013 e.g., achondroplasia \u2013 need not be\ndisabilities at all, according to this view (for more on\nachondroplasia, see Miller 2006; Davis 2010). Glover understands\n\u201cfunctional limitations\u201d as a contrast to normal human\nfunctioning, a species-based notion that itself involves significant\ndegrees of variation and the matter of setting (rather than\ndiscovering) boundaries. As such, \u201cnormal\u201d is not purely\nstatistical, but also partly normative (see also Buchanan et al. 2000).\nGlover recognizes the conceptual messiness of \u201cnormal\nfunctioning\u201d but still prefers it to alternatives. If an\nindividual prefers a bodily state that might otherwise count as a\nfunctional limitation (his example is Asperger\u2019s syndrome), then it\nisn\u2019t a disability for her (2006: 14); it does not\naffect her flourishing. He is much less sanguine about blindness and\ndeafness. Both conditions, he suggests, confer significant functional\nlimitations, and although they can certainly allow\nindividuals to have lives of great worth and flourishing \u2013 he\nexplores conflicting first-person accounts about going blind and\ngaining sight to explore the positive sides of the conditions and the\nnegative side of normalizing (2006: 15\u201322) \u2013 he concludes\nthat they are nonetheless disabilities that confer clear disadvantages\n(related to navigation, safety, etc.). As such, they are disabilities\nthat are understandably acceptable to some, but that ought not be\nchosen for future children. Such future children, like their parents,\nmight be able to flourish with the condition, but engineering it means\nintentionally impairing at least some capacities commonly relevant to\nflourishing. Interestingly, Glover concludes that the Deaf lesbian\ncouple who sought a deaf sperm donor did nothing wrong in conceiving\ntheir deaf child (the child cannot be harmed by his clearly worthwhile\nexistence), but he argues they would be wrong in not giving him a\ncochlear implant if the technology were perfected\n(2006: 26).\n\n\nGlover\u2019s attention to the difficulty of defining\ndisability is helpful, and he emphasizes the importance of taking\nseriously the perspectives of people who have lived with the\ndisabilities in question. But disability scholars push back on this\nline of argument by noting the inherent presumptions about what\nconstitutes flourishing or well-being that underlie the view (Campbell\nand Stramondo 2017; see also Schroeder 2018 who articulates a different\nview about the relevance of well-being, but with similar practical\nconclusions). For instance, what justifies the claim that living in\nsome disabled bodies is clearly disadvantageous, even if the individual\nliving that way understandably values her body, and not just as a\nnecessary reality but as a point of pride (Barnes 2016, esp. Ch 6)?\nWhat epistemic grounds are there for the claim that such a person has\nadapted \u2013 perhaps admirably, to a lesser condition \u2013 rather than\nsimply enjoys living one of a wide variety of good lives (Amundson\n2005, Barnes 2016, Stramondo 2021)?\n\n\nFurther, some scholars argue that disability (and\nalso race) are not simple passive products of reproduction. They are\ninstead active technologies in reproduction. They are instruments\ncreated and used in particular contexts and in the service of certain\ngoals and processes (Valentine 2021). Eugenics arguments often\nnaturalize race and disability as features of bodies, but these\ncategories can instead be understood as practices, relations, and forms\nof social organization (Valentine 2021, Benjamin 2019). On this view,\nthe idea that disability just is a functional limitation with inherent\ndisadvantages \u2013 disadvantages that can be addressed through\nreprogenetics interventions \u2013 ignores the fluidity of the\ncategories and the ways in which larger forces are at play, and it\nthereby ignores social problems, and social, structural solutions\n(Valentine 2021).\n3.5 Undermining core values\n\n\nGiven the emphasis that liberal eugenics\nproponents place on reproductive freedom, another concern raised by\ncritics is related to the possibility that the choices prospective\nparents will make will undermine some central core of human nature or\nof our normal human capacities. For some critics such as Kass (2003)\nand Sandel (2007), the human disposition of hubris or mastery that the\nproject of genetic engineering expresses and promotes, undermines a\ncentral aspect of humanity: our appreciation of the gifted character of\nhuman life, the sense that the way we are is not solely the product of\nour own doing. Similarly, Habermas (2003) contends that in transforming\nreproduction from a natural process of creation to one of manufacture,\ngenetic engineering practices will fundamentally alter relationships in\nthe moral community as well as human freedom and autonomy.\n\n\nConcern with the effects of reprogenetics on human\nnature are also present in proponents of liberal eugenics. For\ninstance, Glover proposes two potential features of great value in our\ncurrent nature: our capacity to rein in our violent and destructive\ntendencies, and our capacity to aim for a good life (for Glover, this\nis about a balance between happiness and flourishing). These are very\ntentatively offered, with many qualifications about possible linkages\nto other traits of value, and the likelihood that we might be more\nsuccessful in securing containment through non-genetic means. Still,\nthe suggestion is that if parents might be tempted to select for\ngenetic markers linked to, for instance, extreme selfishness or\nemotional coldness, in an attempt to have their child succeed in\ngaining power and riches, doing so would seem to endanger parts of our\nnature that we can widely agree are deeply valuable for society as a\nwhole.\n\n\nMost advocates of liberal eugenics, however,\ndismiss worries about effects on human nature. They contend that we\nhave likely unjustifiable intuitions that our present nature is worth\npreserving (Buchanan 2011) or they argue that a main trait of human\nnature is its changeability (Harris 2007). Other advocates claim that\nwe have a tendency to overvalue the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and this\nleads us to see some core values, e.g. openness to the unbidden,\ncurrent longevity parameters, etc., as optimal when in fact we are\nsimply affected by status quo bias (Green 2007; Bostrom and Ord\n2006).\n\n\nSome critics (Sparrow 2012) have argued that\nadvocates of liberal eugenics face a problem if they reject the idea\nthat some conception of human nature or of normal human capacities\nmatters for debates about genetic improvement. They must accept that\nparents\u2019 have reasons to choose some traits in spite of repugnant\nconsequences, or that parents\u2019 choices regarding some human\ntraits must take into account the interests of society. Others contend\nthat proponents of liberal eugenics simply fail to appreciate the\nhistoricity of the human condition and view human beings as a\ncollection of parameters that can be optimized in isolation of each\nother (Nordmann 2007).\n\n\nStill other critics (Sandel 2007; Kass 2003)\nhighlight the ways in which the motivations for the genetic improvement\nof our offspring express hubris, a \u201cdrive to mastery\u201d\n(Sandel 2007: 27) that, left unchecked, threatens not just human\nnature, but the meaning of parent-child relationships, from openness to\nthe \u201cunbidden\u201d and unconditional love to design and\nmanufacture (Kass 2003); from loving whatever child comes along, to\nloving a particular child because of chosen traits (Herissone-Kelly\n2007).\n\n\nSandel recognizes that many parents already exert\nexcessive influence on their children\u2019s lives, and may fail to love\nthem unconditionally, but he worries that genetic technologies will\nonly exasperate that tendency. Even though we might undertake genetic\npractices for the benefit of our offspring, in so doing, we make them\ninto creatures who must be indebted to us for their gifts, and for whom\nour love may be conditional on fulfilling our desires. If a parent\ndesigns a child to be a certain way, her investment will increase the\nparent\u2019s demands. In a similar vein, Kass (2003) notes that\nparental hopes will become parental expectations if we allow the\ndesigning of children. The concern about parental expectations and how\nchoice might affect the unconditional love we envision for parents is\nalso explored by disability scholars (Kittay and Kittay 2000; Asch and\nWasserman 2005).\n\n\nProponents of liberal eugenics respond that much\nof what we attempt to do in medicine to create treatments for disease\ncould itself fit under a \u201cdrive to mastery\u201d and might\nlikewise question our commitment to being \u201copen to the\nunbidden\u201d (see Buchanan 2011). Also, if the point is simply that\nwe must be attentive to our inclinations to hubris \u2013 we might get\ncarried away in thinking we can enhance appropriately \u2013 then we\ncould heed that warning without rejecting the use of genetic\ntechnologies to improve our offspring entirely. Other advocates simply\ndeny the value of humility (Glover 2006: 113).\n\n\nKamm (2005) dismisses Sandel\u2019s worries about\nmastery and openness to the unbidden but raises a different kind of\nworry about the enhancement project, one related to concerns regarding\naggregate effects of individual choice. Her fear is that we may lack\nimagination to see how a variety of traits (and different combinations\nof traits) can create goods we have yet to envision or experience.\nParents who might wish to design their child to have the good trait of\ncomposing classical music, for instance, would have been unable to\nconceive that it would be good to have a child who turns out to be one\nof the Beatles, at to have conceived it, would have involved creating\nthe style before the Beatles did.\n\n\nAnother worry linked to the desire for control\ncomes from Habermas (2003) who grounds his arguments in a deontological\nframework. He argues that by engineering our children in very specific\nways \u2013 beyond the treatment of disease \u2013 we may undermine their\ncapacity for self-definition, their sense of being responsible for\nthemselves (in respect to creating their own identities), and their\nfreedom (2003: 12\u201313). He claims that it is not genetic\nengineering per se that is the problem, but rather\nthe scope of its use as well as the attitude. In this case, the\nwrong attitude is one that is not attentive to likely second person\nconsent to the changes \u2013 would the child have granted approval for\nthe selected traits? For Habermas, what matters is the attitude of\nappreciating the need for the future person\u2019s presumed consent, rather\nthan the idea of making the change merely according to parental\npreferences.\n\n\nFurther, he worries that parents who engineer\ntheir children will have expectations of their children \u201cwithout,\nhowever, providing the addressee [the child] with an opportunity to\ntake a revisionist stand\u201d (2003: 51). Why not?\nThe genetic program is a mute, and in a sense, unanswerable fact. This\nis so because, unlike persons born naturally, someone who is at odds\nwith genetically fixed intentions is barred from developing, in the\ncourse of a reflectively appropriated and deliberately continued life\nhistory, an attitude toward her talents (and handicaps) which implies a\nrevised self-understanding and allows for\na productive response to the initial situation\n(Habermas 2003: 62).\n\n\nThe basis for this claim seems to rest on a\ndistinction between \u201cthe grown and the made\u201d (Habermas,\n2003: 52). Being created to be a particular way is\nbeing made, and so objectified, a product of the parents.\nBeing grown, by contrast, recognizes the individual subjectivity of the\nnew person, who is equal to her parents and not defined by them. This\nobjection shares much with Kass\u2019s (2003) concerns about genetic\ndespotism \u2013 control of one generation by the previous one.\n\n\nMany liberal eugenics advocates (Glover 2006;\nGreen 2007; Buchanan 2011) are also dismissive of these concerns. For\nthem, it is unclear how genetic selection or editing is different from\nother activities that presumably are also intended by parents to\n\u201cmake\u201d their children, such as registering them in school,\nsports practice, or piano lessons with the aim of having children who\nare likely to became academics, athletes, or musicians. Moreover,\nliberal eugenics proponents contend that it is not clear either why the\ngenetically designed child could not be revisionist\nin her response to her parents. Designing a child to have features that\nmake, for example, an athletic career possible (even likely) is not the\nsame as ensuring such a career, or even an athletic body. Parenting\nwould not lose its challenges simply because of the origins of the\nfeatures of the child in question.\n\n\nHowever, critics contend that advocates of liberal\neugenics assume that there are no morally relevant differences in the\nmeans parents take to try to shape their children. Such assumption\nseems questionable. For instance, the longer iterative process of\neducating a child enforces a kind of communicative engagement in ways\nthat cannot be part of engineering an embryo (Malmqvist 2011). Indeed,\narguably it is not just the means that are different (de\nMelo-Mart\u00edn 2018). The goals of engineering an embryo\n\u2013through selection or editing \u2013 and the goals of educating a\nchild \u2013in various ways \u2013 are similar only in appearance.\nWhile genetic selection or editing focuses on a particular trait, the\nemphasis of education or training is the whole person, with attention\nto the particular child\u2019s personality, even if the aspect of\ninterest \u2013e.g., music or sport excellence \u2013 are the\ncharacteristic that parents aim to inculcate in their children.\n \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Agar, Nicholas, 2004, <em>Liberal Eugenics:\nIn Defence of Human Enhancement</em>, Oxford UK: Blackwell.", "Anomaly, Jonathan, 2020. <em>Creating Future\nPeople: The Ethics of Genetic Enhancement</em>, London: Routledge.", "Amundson, Ron, 2005, \u201cDisability, Ideology\nand Quality of Life: A Bias in Biomedical Ethics\u201d, in Wasserman,\nBickenbach, and Wachbroit (eds), 101\u2013124.", "Asch, Adrienne, 1999, \u201cPrenatal Diagnosis\nand Selective Abortion: A Challenge to Practice and\nPolicy\u201d, <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>, 89(11):\n1649\u201357.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2000, \u201cWhy I Haven\u2019t\nChanged My Mind about Prenatal Diagnosis\u201d, in Parens and Asch\n(eds), 234\u2013358.", "Asch, Adrienne and Erik Parens, 2000, \u201cThe\nDisability Rights Critque of Prenatal Genetic Testing: Reflections and\nRecommendations\u201d, in Parens and Asch 2000: 3\u201343.", "Asch, Adrienne and David Wasserman, 2005,\n\u201cWhere is the Sin in Synecdoche?
