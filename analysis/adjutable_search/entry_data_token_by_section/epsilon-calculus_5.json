    "main_text": "More Recent Developments\n6. More Recent Developments\n\nIn this section we discuss the development of the epsilon-substitution\nmethod for obtaining consistency results for strong systems; these\nresults are of a mathematical nature. We cannot, unfortunately,\ndiscuss the details of the proofs here but would like to indicate that\nthe epsilon-substitution method did not die with Hilbert\u2019s\nprogram, and that a significant amount of current research is carried\nout in epsilon-formalisms.\n\nGentzen\u2019s consistency proofs for arithmetic\n launched a field of research known as ordinal analysis, and\nthe program of measuring the strength of mathematical theories using\nordinal notations is still pursued today. This is particularly\nrelevant to the extended Hilbert\u2019s program, where the\ngoal is to justify classical mathematics relative to constructive, or\nquasi-constructive, systems. Gentzen\u2019s methods of\ncut-elimination (and extensions to infinitary logic developed by Paul\nLorentzen, Petr Novikov, and Kurt Sch\u00fctte) have, in large part,\nsupplanted epsilon substitution methods in these pursuits. But epsilon\ncalculus methods provide an alternative approach, and there is still\nactive research on ways to extend Hilbert-Ackermann methods to\nstronger theories. The general pattern remains the same:\n\nEmbed the theory under investigation in an appropriate epsilon\ncalculus.\nDescribe a process for updating assignments to the epsilon\nterms.\nShow that the procedure is normalizing, i.e., given any set of\nterms, there is a sequence of updates that results in an assignment\nthat satisfies the axioms.\n\n\nSince the last step guarantees the consistency of the original theory,\nfrom a foundational point of view one is interested in the methods\nused to prove normalization. For example, one obtains an ordinal\nanalysis by assigning ordinal notations to steps in the\nprocedure, in such a way that the value of a notation decreases with\neach step.\n\nIn the 1960\u2019s, Tait (1960, 1965, 2010) extended\nAckermann\u2019s methods to obtain an ordinal analysis of extensions\nof arithmetic with principles of transfinite induction. More\nstreamlined and modern versions of this approach can be found in Mints\n2001 and Avigad 2002b. More recently, Mints, Tupailo, and Buchholz\nhave considered stronger, yet still predicatively justifiable,\nfragments of analysis, including theories of arithmetic comprehension\nand a \\(\\Delta^{1}_1\\)-comprehension rule (Mints, Tupailo &\nBuchholz 1996; Mints & Tupailo 1999; see also Mints 2016). Arai\n2002 has extended the epsilon substitution method to theories that\nallow one to iterate arithmetic comprehension along primitive\nrecursive well orderings. In particular, his work yields ordinal\nanalyses for predicative fragments of analysis involving transfinite\nhierarchies and transfinite induction.\n\nSome first steps have been taken in using the epsilon substitution\nmethod in the analysis of impredicative theories (see Arai\n2003, 2006 and Mints 2015).\n\nA variation on step 3 above involves showing that the normalization\nprocedure is not sensitive to the choice of updates, which is to say,\nany sequence of updates terminates. This is called strong\nnormalization. Mints 1996 has shown that many of the procedures\nconsidered have this stronger property.\n\nIn addition to the traditional, foundational branch of proof theory,\ntoday there is a good deal of interest in structural proof\ntheory, a branch of the subject that focuses on logical deductive\ncalculi and their properties. This research is closely linked with\nissues relevant to computer science, having to do with automated\ndeduction, functional programming, and computer aided verification.\nHere, too, Gentzen-style methods tend to dominate (see again the\n entry on proof theory).\n But the epsilon calculus can also provide valuable insights; cf. for\nexample Aguilera & Baaz 2019, or the discussion of\nHerbrand\u2019s theorem above.\n\nAside from the investigations of the epsilon calculus in proof theory,\ntwo applications should be mentioned. One is the use of epsilon\nnotation in Bourbaki\u2019s Theorie des ensembles (1958).\nThe second, of perhaps greater current interest, is the use of the\nepsilon-operator in the theorem-proving systems\n HOL\n and\n Isabelle,\n where the expressive power of epsilon-terms yields significant\npractical advantages.\n",
