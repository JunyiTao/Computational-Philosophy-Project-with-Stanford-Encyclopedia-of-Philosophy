    "main_text": "Cultural Politics || Naturalism\n3.1 Naturalism\n\nTo be a naturalist in Rorty\u2019s sense,\n\n\nis to be the kind of antiessentialist who, like Dewey, sees no breaks\nin the hierarchy of increasingly complex adjustments to novel\nstimulation \u2013 the hierarchy which has amoeba adjusting\nthemselves to changed water temperature at the bottom, bees dancing\nand chess players check-mating in the middle, and people fomenting\nscientific, artistic, and political revolutions at the top. (ORT,\n109)\n\n\nIn Rorty\u2019s view, both Dewey\u2019s pragmatism and Darwinism\nencourage us to see vocabularies as tools to be assessed in terms of\nthe particular purposes they may serve. Our vocabularies, Rorty\nsuggests, \u201chave no more of a representational relation to an\nintrinsic nature of things than does the anteater\u2019s snout or the\nbowerbird\u2019s skill at weaving\u201d (TP, 48). Pragmatic\nevaluation of various linguistically infused practices requires a\ndegree of specificity. From Rorty\u2019s perspective, to suggest that\nwe might evaluate vocabularies with respect to their ability to\nuncover the truth would be like claiming to evaluate tools for their\nability to help us get what we want \u2013 full stop. Is the hammer\nor the saw or the scissors better \u2013 in general? Questions about\nusefulness can only be answered, Rorty points out, once we give\nsubstance to our purposes.\n\nRorty\u2019s pragmatist appropriation of Darwin also defuses the\nsignificance of reduction. He rejects as representationalist the sort\nof naturalism that implies a program of nomological or conceptual\nreduction to terms at home in a basic science. Rorty\u2019s\nnaturalism echoes Nietzsche\u2019s perspectivism; a descriptive\nvocabulary is valuable insofar as the patterns it highlights are\nusefully attended to by creatures with needs and interests like ours.\nDarwinian naturalism, for Rorty, implies that there is no one\nprivileged vocabulary whose purpose it is to serve as a critical\ntouchstone for our various descriptive practices.\n\nFor Rorty, then, any vocabulary, even that of evolutionary\nexplanation, is a tool for a purpose, and therefore subject to\nteleological assessment. Typically, Rorty justifies his own commitment\nto Darwinian naturalism by suggesting that this vocabulary is suited\nto further the secularization and democratization of society that\nRorty thinks we should aim for. Accordingly, there is a close tie\nbetween Rorty\u2019s construal of the naturalism he endorses and his\nmost basic political convictions.\n",
