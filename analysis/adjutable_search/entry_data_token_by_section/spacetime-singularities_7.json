    "main_text": "Cosmology and the Arrow of Time\n8. Analogue Black Holes and Hawking Radiation\n\nThe Hawking temperature of a macroscopic black hole is unimaginably\nsmall. For the black hole at the center of the Milky Way (Sagittarius\nA*), approximately 4 million solar masses, it is\napproximately 10-14 Kelvin. Even a black hole of one solar\nmass would have a temperature of only about 60 billionths of a Kelvin.\nDirect experimental verification of its existence therefore seems\nbeyond the realm of the imaginable, at least for macroscopic black\nholes. (If nothing else, it would be utterly swamped just by the\nordinary cosmic microwave background radiation, itself approximately\n2.7 Kelvin, a raging inferno in comparison.) \n\nIn 1981, Unruh pointed out that a direct analogue of Hawking radiation\nshould occur in the most mundane and ordinary of physical systems,\nflowing water (under particular conditions). The physical basis for\nhis idea is almost ridiculously simple: if water is flowing past a\nboundary more rapidly than its speed of sound, than an effective event\nhorizon forms, for any disturbances in the water, which will propagate\nwith the speed of sound, will necessarily be \u201ctrapped\u201d\nbehind the boundary. He then argued that the scattering of water\nwavelets at the boundary will occur with a thermalized spectrum, in\nexact accord with Hawking radiation (Unruh 1981, 2008). Since then,\nanalogue models for Hawking radiation in a wide variety of fluid,\nsolid-state, optical and quantum systems have been found. (See\nBarcel\u00f3 et al. 2011, Robertson 2012, Jacobson 2013,\nand Faccio et al. 2013 for recent reviews.) \n\nThe remarkable fact that is of most interest to us is that, because\nUnruh's arguments relied only on simple physical properties of\nno-escape boundaries and the low-energy behavior of thermalized\nradiation caused by scattering of fields off of such boundaries, Unruh\nconcluded that these so-called \u201cdumb holes\u201d (dumb because\nsilent) could serve as experimentally viable proxies for testing the\nexistence of Hawking radiation for black holes (Leonhardt and Philbin\n2008). In particular, the validity of the analogue models is argued\nfor on the grounds that the essential features of Hawking radiation\nare due solely to a few simple, formal kinematical conditions\nsatisfied by a wide range of kinds of physical systems (Visser 1998a,\n2013; Unruh and Sch\u00fctzhold 2005; Unruh 2014). In particular, the\nmanifestation of radiation-like behavior formally analogous to true\nHawking radiation from a black hole has nothing to do with any\nspecific, dynamical features of general relativity. Therefore, the\nthought goes, to detect the analogue of Hawking radiation in any of\nthese systems provides indirect but strong confirmational support for\nthe existence of actual Hawking radiation. There are, moreover, now\nseveral claims to have experimentally detected analogue Hawking\nradiation: Belgiorno et al. (2010) based on ultrashort laser\npulse filaments, i.e., intense laser pulses in a transparent\nKerr medium (those with a third-order optical nonlinearity);\nWeinfurtner et al. (2011) based on obstructed supersonic\nfluid flow; Steinhauer (2014) based on a \u201cblack-hole\nlaser\u201d composed of phonons in an Einstein-Bose condensate; and\nthe list goes on. So, has Hawking radiation been experimentally\nconfirmed, even if only indirectly? \n\nUntil recently, little philosophical work has been done on these\nanalogue black holes. Dardashti et al. (2017) argue that such\nanalogue models of event horizons and Hawking radiation can provide\npowerful confirmatory support for the existence of Hawking radiation\naround actual black holes. Indeed, they argue that these particular\nkinds of analogue model and the concomitant support they purport to\nprovide are novel, both in the sense of being of a sort not\ninvestigated before in the philosophical literature and in the sense\nof representing an innovation in actual scientific practice. (See the\nEncyclopaedia entry\n Analogy and Analogical Reasoning.)\n They base their claim on the fact that these are not only theoretical\nmodels, but that they can be\u2014and are\u2014implemented as actual\nexperiments, and thus constitute not merely analogical reasoning, but\nexperimentally controlled physical simulation. If one accepts a\ncertain kind of universality argument (Unruh and Sch\u00fctzhold\n2005), they claim, then it is this latter characteristic that lends\nthe analogue models the possibility of strong confirmatory support of\nactual Hawking radiation; and to the contrary, without acceptance of\nthat universality argument\u2014if the models were based merely on\nstandard analogical theoretical reasoning\u2014no confirmatory\nsupport at all would be had. \n\nGryb et al. (2018) compare the kinds of universality argument\nseemingly needed in this case to the more standard, familiar form of\nsuch arguments made in the context of renormalization group methods.\nThey conclude that all available universality arguments made to\nsupport taking analogue experiments to confirm the existence of\nHawking radiation are wanting in at least one of six categories that\nthey collectively deem necessary for such arguments to work\n(robustness, physical plausibility, degree of universality, empirical\nsupport, and integration of robustness and universality), with failure\nof integration being the most serious problem. \n\nThere is room, moreover, for yet more skepticism here. The arguments\nare prima facie strong that the analogue of Hawking radiation\nshould manifest in a wide range of systems, as a purely kinematical\neffect following directly from a few simple kinematical principles\nthat all those systems satisfy (Unruh 2014). Nonetheless, true\ngravitational black holes are radically different from all the\nproposed analogue systems, in a variety of extensive and deep ways, as\nis general relativity as a physical theory from all the theories\ngoverning those other types of systems. As the debate and dissension\ndiscussed in\n section 6.1\n illustrates, the fundamental physics of Hawking radiation may not be\nwell enough understood to have confidence that some confounding\nphysical factor cannot be present in purely gravitational systems that\nis not present in any of the analogue systems, a factor that would\nblock production of Hawking radiation by true black holes. In other\nwords, there seems prima facie little reason to have faith\nthat the universality condition holds, except on the basis of purely\ntheoretical arguments pertaining to systems we have no empirical\nexperience of nor access to whatsoever. \n",
