    "main_text": "Main Themes || The Dimensionless\n2.4 The Dimensionless\n\nThe fourth theme, the dimensionless (wu hou, literally\n\u201clacking thickness\u201d), is more obscure, mentioned only once\nin the Xunzi and once in the Annals of L\u00fc\nBuwei. The dimensionless probably refers to a geometric point.\nAccording to the Mohists, the dimensionless does not\n\u201cfill\u201d anything (A65). A starting point (duan) is\nthe dimensionless tip of a solid object (A61). Allusions to the\ndisputers sometimes contrast the dimensionless with \u201cthe\ndimensioned\u201d (you hou, \u201chaving thickness\u201d),\nwhich the Mohists explain as having something it is bigger than (A55).\nThe dimensionless is probably associated with the disputers because of\nHui Shi\u2019s paradox that \u201cThe dimensionless cannot be\naccumulated, yet its size is a thousand miles.\u201d (Points cannot\nbe accumulated, yet a great girth or length is the sum of the points\nthat constitute it.) In passages referring to the disputers and their\nsophistries, \u201cthe dimensionless\u201d probably alludes to any\nparadox arising from the concept of a geometric point or an\ninfinitesimal. \n",
