    "main_text": "Further Issues || The Interpretation of SM Probabilities\n7.1 The Interpretation of SM Probabilities\n\nHow to interpret probabilities is a problem with a long philosophical\ntradition (for a survey of different views see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\n Since SM introduces probabilities, there is a question of how these\nprobabilities should be interpreted. This problem is particularly\npressing in SM because, as we have seen, the underlying mechanical\nlaws are deterministic. This is not a problem so long as the\nprobabilities are interpreted epistemically as in Jaynes\u2019\naccount\n (\u00a76.6).\n But, as we have seen, a subjective interpretation seems to clash with\nthe realist intuition that SM is a physical theory that tells us how\nthings are independently of what we happen to know about them. This\nrequires probabilities to be objective.\n\nApproaches to SM that rely on ergodic theory tend to interpret\nprobabilities as time-averages, which is natural because ergodicity\nprovides such averages. However, long-run time averages are not a good\nindicator for how a system behaves because, as we have seen, they are\nconstant and so do not indicate how a system behaves out of\nequilibrium. Furthermore, interpreting long-run time averages as\nprobabilities is motivated by the fact the that these averages seem to\nbe close cousins of long-run relative frequencies. But this\nassociation is problematic for a number of reasons (Emch 2005;\nGuttmann 1999; van Lith 2003; von Plato 1981, 1982, 1988,\n1994).\u00a0An alternative is to interpret SM probabilities as\npropensities, but many regard this as\u00a0problematic because\npropensities would ultimately seem to be incompatible with a\ndeterministic underlying micro theory (Clark 2001).\n\nLoewer (2001) suggested that we interpret SM probabilities as Humean\nobjective chances in Lewis\u2019 sense (1980) because the Mentaculus\n(see\n \u00a74.6)\n is a best system in Lewis\u2019 sense. Frigg (2008a) identifies some\nproblems with this interpretation, and Frigg and Hoefer (2015)\nformulate an alternative Humean account that is designed to overcome\nthese issues. For further discussion of Humean chances in SM, see\nBeisbart (2014), Dardashti, Glynn, Th\u00e9bault, and Frisch (2014),\nHemmo and Shenker (2022),\u00a0 Hoefer (2019), and Myrvold (2016,\n2021).\n",
