    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nHeinrich Scholz (1884\u20131956), German Protestant theologian,\nphilosopher, and logician, began his academic career as a protestant\nsystematic theologian at the University of Breslau. He then moved to\nthe University of Kiel and in 1928 to the University of M\u00fcnster\nin Westphalia. His Religionsphilosophie (Scholz 1921) became\nparticularly influential in protestant theology. Inspired by Alfred\nNorth Whitehead\u2019s and Bertrand Russell\u2019s Principia\nMathematica (Whitehead and Russell 1910\u20131913) he changed\nhis research area to mathematical logic and foundational research. He\nwas successful in establishing the \u201cSchule von\nM\u00fcnster\u201d (\u201cM\u00fcnster School\u201d) of\nlogicians and in founding the first academic department for\nmathematical logic in Germany, the \u201cInstitut f\u00fcr\nMathematische Logik und Grundlagenforschung\u201d\n(\u201cInstitute for Mathematical Logic and Foundational\nResearch\u201d) in M\u00fcnster, which is still in existence today.\nScholz combined research on logical calculi with an epistemological\nPlatonism and openness for metaphysical approaches. Nevertheless, he\nfelt close to the scientific world view of Logical Empiricism.\nFurthermore, with his Geschichte der Logik (Scholz 1931a)\nHeinrich Scholz was a pioneer in the historiography of logic.\n",
