    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || Weak and Strong Altruism\n3.2 Weak and Strong Altruism\n\nA quite different ambiguity concerns the distinction between weak and\nstrong altruism, in the terminology of D.S. Wilson (1977, 1980,\n1990). This distinction is about whether the altruistic action entails\nan absolute or relative fitness reduction for the donor. To count as\nstrongly altruistic, a behaviour must reduce the absolute\nfitness (i.e., number of offspring) of the donor. Strong altruism is\nthe standard notion of altruism in the literature, and was assumed\nabove. To count as weakly altruistic, an action need only reduce\nthe relative fitness of the donor, i.e., its fitness relative\nto that of the recipient. Thus for example, an action which causes an\norganism to leave an additional 10 offspring, but causes each\norganism(s) with which it interacts to leave an additional 20\noffspring, is weakly but not strongly altruistic. The action boosts\nthe absolute fitness of the \u2018donor\u2019, but boosts the\nabsolute fitness of other organisms by even more, thus reducing the\ndonor's relative fitness.\n\n\nShould weakly altruistic behaviours be classified as altruistic or\nselfish? This question is not merely semantic; for the real issue is\nwhether the conditions under which weak altruism can evolve are\nrelevantly similar to the conditions under which strong altruism can\nevolve, or not. Many authors argue that the answer is\n\u2018no\u2019, on the grounds that weakly altruistic behaviours are\nindividually advantageous, so can evolve with no component of kin\nselection or donor-recipient correlation, unlike strongly altruistic\nbehaviours (Grafen 1984, Nunney 1985, West et\nal. 2007). To appreciate this argument, consider a\ngame-theoretic scenario similar to the one-shot Prisoner's dilemma of\nsection 4, in which organisms engage in a pair-wise interaction that\naffects their fitness. Organisms are of two types, weakly altruistic\n(W) and non-altruistic (N). W-types perform\nan action that boosts their own fitness by 10 units and the fitness of\ntheir partner by 20 units; N-types do not perform the action. The\npayoff matrix is thus:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer 2\n\n\n\n\nWeak Altruist\nNon\n\n\nPlayer 1\nWeak Altruist\n30,30\n10,20\n\n\nNon\n20,10\n0,0\n\n\nPayoffs for (Player 1, Player 2) in units of reproductive\nfitness\n\n\nThe payoff matrix highlights the fact that weak altruism is\nindividually advantageous, and thus the oddity of thinking of it it as\naltruistic rather than selfish. To see this, assume for a moment that\nthe game is being played by two rational agents, as in classical game\ntheory. Clearly, the rational strategy for each individual\nis W, for W dominates N. Each individual\ngets a higher payoff from playing W\nthan N, irrespective of what its opponent \ndoes\u201430 rather than 20 if the opponent plays W, 10 rather\nthan 0 if the opponent plays N. This captures a clear sense\nin which weak altruism is individually advantageous.\n\nIn the context of evolutionary game theory, where the game is being\nplayed by pairs of organisms with hard-wired strategies, the\ncounterpart of the fact that W dominates N is the\nfact that W can spread in the population even if pairs are\nformed at random (cf. Wilson 1980). To see this, consider the\nexpressions for the overall population-wide fitnesses of W\nand N:\n\nW(W) = 30 * Prob(W partner/W) + 10\n* Prob(N partner/W)\n\n\nW(N) = 20 * Prob(W partner/N) + 0\n* Prob(N partner/N)\n\n\n(As before, Prob(W partner/W) denotes the\nconditional probability of having a weakly altruistic partner given\nthat one is weakly altruistic oneself, and so-on.)  From these\nexpressions, it is easy to see that W(W)\n> W(N) even if the there is no correlation among\npartners, i.e., even if Prob(W partner/W) =\nP(W partner/N) and P(N partner/W)\n= P(N partner/N). Therefore, weak altruism can evolve in the\nabsence of donor-recipient correlation; as we saw, this is not true of\nstrong altruism. So weak and strong altruism evolve by different\nevolutionary mechanisms, hence should not be co-classified, according\nto this argument.\n\n\nHowever, there is a counter argument due to D.S. Wilson (1977, 1980),\nwho maintains that weak altruism cannot evolve by individual selection\nalone; a component of group selection is needed. Wilson's argument\nstems from the fact that in a mixed (W,N) pair, the\nnon-altruist is fitter than the weak altruist. More generally, within\na single group of any size containing weak altruists and\nnon-altruists, the latter will be fitter. So weak altruism can only\nevolve, Wilson argues, in a multi-group setting\u2014in which the\nwithin-group selection in favour of N, is counteracted by\nbetween-group selection in favour of W. (On Wilson's view, the\nevolutionary game described above is a multi-group setting, involving\na large number of groups of size two.) Thus weak altruism, like strong\naltruism, in fact evolves because it is group-advantageous, Wilson\nargues.\n\n\nThe dispute between those who regard weak altruism as individually\nadvantageous, and those like Wilson who regard it as group\nadvantageous, stems ultimately from differing conceptions of\nindividual and group selection. For Wilson, individual selection means\nwithin-group selection, so to determine which strategy is favoured by\nindividual selection, one must compare the fitnesses of W\nand N types within a group, or pair. For other theorists,\nindividual selection means selection based on differences in\nindividual phenotype, rather than social context; so to determine\nwhich strategy is favoured by individual selection, one must compare\nthe fitnesses of W and N types in the same social\ncontext, i.e., with the same partner. These two comparisons yield\ndifferent answers to the question of whether weak altruism is\nindividually advantageous. Thus the debate over how to classify weak\naltruism is intimately connected to the broader levels of selection\nquestion; see Nunney 1985, Okasha 2005, 2006, Fletcher and Doebeli\n2006, West et al. 2007, for further discussion.\n",
