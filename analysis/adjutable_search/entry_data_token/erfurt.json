The notion that a word, once it has\nbeen imposed to signify, carries with it all of its syntactical modes,\nor possible combinations with other words, had been around since the\ntwelfth century. What the Modistae did was to posit the\norigins of the modi significandi in terms of parallel\ntheories of modi intelligendi (modes of understanding) and\nmodi essendi (modes of being). The result was a curious\namalgam of philosophy, grammar, and linguistics. Thomas of Erfurt\u2019s\nDe modis significandi became the standard Modist textbook in\nthe fourteenth century, though it has since enjoyed even greater fame\nlater thanks to its misidentification as a work of Duns Scotus. The\ntext appeared in early printed editions of Scotus\u2019s Opera\nOmnia, where it was read and commented upon by later figures such\nas Charles S. Peirce and Martin Heidegger, whose 1916 doctoral thesis,\nDie Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus, should\nhave been titled, Die Kategorienlehre des Duns Scotus und die\nBedeutungslehre des Thomas von Erfurt.\n", "toc": [{"#Life": "1.

Life\n\nAlmost nothing is known about the life of Thomas of Erfurt except that\nhe was active as a teacher and philosopher in the first quarter of the\nfourteenth\n century.[1]\n Presumably, he came from the city of Erfurt in present-day Germany.\nHis work shows the influence of the Paris Arts Masters Radulphus Brito\n(ca. 1270\u20131320) and Siger of Courtrai (ca. 1280\u20131341),\nwhich suggests that he was educated and perhaps also taught at the\nUniversity of\n Paris.[2]\n Later documents associate him with the school of St. Severus and the\nSchottenkloster of St. Jacob at\n Erfurt.[3]\n His most famous grammatical text, De modis significandi (On\nthe Modes of Signifying) was known by 1310 and was already being\ncommented upon by 1324. It is possible that he returned to Paris a\nnumber of times over the course of his academic career, although there\nare no records attesting to this.\n\nSome copies of De modis significandi attribute the work to an\nearly fourteenth-century English cleric named Thomas of Occam, but\nscholars have been skeptical about this because it occurs in just a\nhandful fifteenth-century\n manuscripts.[4]\n The vast majority of the manuscript evidence, and all of the earliest\nwitnesses, refer to its author as Thomas of Erfurt.\n2. Writings\n\nSix works have been attributed to Thomas of Erfurt. In addition to the\naforementioned grammatical treatise, whose full title is Tractatus\nde modis significandi seu Grammatica speculativa (ed.\nBursill-Hall\n 1972),[5]\n there are four short expositiones, or literal commentaries:\non Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge, Aristotle\u2019s Categories,\nAristotle\u2019s De interpretatione, and the anonymous Liber\nsex principiorum (Book of Six Principles). Finally, there is a\nvery brief work of mnemonic verses for teaching grammar to schoolboys,\nCommentarius in carmen \u2018Fundamentum puerorum\u2019\n(ed. Gansiniec 1960), although its editor believes that it is actually\nan anonymous abridgement of De modis significandi. In any\ncase, Thomas\u2019s reputation derives from De modis significandi,\nwhich remains his only work to have been studied in detail.\n\nDe modis significandi proved to be so popular that it became\nthe standard (and later, the representative) text for the Modist\ntradition (see next section), surviving in over 40 fourteenth- and\nfifteenth-century manuscripts. A printed edition appeared in the late\nfifteenth century that was reprinted a remarkable 11 times before its\n\u2018definitive\u2019 reprinting in Luke Wadding\u2019s 1639 edition of\nthe complete works of Duns\n Scotus.[6]\n3. Modism\n\nThomas of Erfurt belonged to an interesting though somewhat obscure\ngroup of late thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century philosophers\nknown as the speculative grammarians or Modistae. The term\n\u2018speculative grammarian\u2019 is ambiguous because it is also\nused by historians of medieval philosophy to refer to twelfth-century\nParisian grammar masters such as William of Conches, Peter Helias, and\nRalph of Beauvais, who systematically revised the ancient grammars of\nDonatus and Priscian \u2014 textbooks used to teach Latin to\nschoolboys \u2014 to produce a universal\n semantics.[7]\n The two groups are related, as it turns out, since these latter-day\ngrammarians adopted many of the theories as well as the universalizing\ntendencies of their twelfth-century predecessors. Foremost among them\nwas the theory of the modi significandi, or modes of\nsignifying. The term \u2018Modistae\u2019 or\n\u2018Modist\u2019 properly refers to the later group.\n\nThere was already a grammatical concept of the modi\nsignificandi by the time the first Modistae, Martin of\nDacia and Boethius of Dacia, appeared in Paris sometime before\n 1270.[8]\n Originally, the idea referred to the different ways in which a word\nor expression (dictio) is able to signify something. Words\nthemselves are the product of a primary act of imposition by which a\nparticular utterance is connected to some thing or property of a\nthing, the utterance providing the matter, which is said to be\n\u2018informed\u2019 by the act of imposition. The word acquires its\nmodi significandi through a second act of imposition encoding\nall of the general syntactic roles it can play in connection with\nother words and expressions, such as the various parts of speech it\ncan fulfill (e.g., noun, verb, adverb) and the grammatical forms of\nthese parts (e.g., the gender, number, and case of nouns; the tense\nand mood of verbs). These modes are said to cause the various lexical\nforms exhibited by the word in spoken and written languages. Thus,\nLatin uses the word \u2018canis\u2019 to signify what\nEnglish speakers mean by \u2018dog\u2019, but the same modes of\nsignifying determine their function as singular and as\n nouns.[9]\n We might think of modi significandi metaphorically as hooks\nor fasteners on a word because they reflect its potential for\ncombination with other words in propositions and other grammatically\nwell-formed constructions.\n\nIt is easy to see how such an account of meaning could lead to a\nbona fide theory of grammar, what Jan Pinborg called\n\u201cthe first systematic syntax developed in western\n linguistics\u201d.[10]\n Indeed, speculative grammarians of both periods have attracted the\nattention of linguists and philosophers\n alike.[11]\n But the stakes were higher for the Modistae because the\ninflux of Aristotle\u2019s writings on metaphysics and natural philosophy\nin the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries forced everyone to\nthink in terms of a new paradigm of knowledge. Could grammar be\nreconceived as the science of language (scientia\nsermocinalis)? The question here was whether grammar could count\nas an Aristotelian speculative science, i.e., whether it is\ndemonstrative in the sense of being a knowledge-producing activity\nordained by a single subject whose principles are universal and\n necessary.[12]\n Concerns of this sort clearly underlie Boethius of Dacia\u2019s appraisal\nof traditional grammar:\n\nsubjects in which a demonstrative mode of knowing is possible are\nseldom taught in a demonstrative way, but descriptively [sed modo\nnarrativo] \u2026 That is why Priscian states many conclusions\nfor which he offers no reasons, but merely the authority of ancient\ngrammarians. Accordingly, he does not teach, for only those who offer\nreasons for what they say are\n teachers.[13]\n\n\nThomas of Erfurt indicates in the opening lines of De modis\nsignificativis that he aims to be one of these teachers:\n\nThe rationale of the method. Since in all science, to\nunderstand and to know come about from the knowledge of principles, as\nis written in I Physics, text comment 1, therefore, wishing\nto have knowledge of the science of grammar, it is primarily necessary\nfor us to dwell upon all of its primary per se principles of\nwhich modes are the modes of signifying. But before knowledge is\nsought after in the particulars, there are certain things to be set\nout in advance in general, without which it is not possible to have\nthe fullest understanding of them. (DMS, Preamble;\nBursill-Hall: 1)\n\n\nFor Modistae such as Boethius of Dacia and Thomas of Erfurt,\nthe proper subject of grammar is well-formed, significant speech\n(sermo congrue significativus), the principles of which are\nexpressed in the modi significandi.\n\nBut this is where things get interesting, for the Modistae\nalso understood the theory of the modi significandi to\ninvolve claims about the nature of thought and reality. The problem\nwith Priscian, as twelfth-century grammarians had pointed out, is that\nhe said nothing about what causes the different parts of\nspeech. Hence the need for a theory of the modi significandi.\nBut the Modistae saw that this could only be part of the\nanswer, for grammar is a linguistic phenomenon, and linguistic\nphenomena must have a cause within the natural order of things.\nTherefore, to complete the explanation, they argued that the formal\nstructure of the modi significandi owes its existence to\nmodi intelligendi, or modes of understanding, which in turn\nare caused by modi essendi, or the modes of being a thing can\nexhibit outside the mind.\n\nThe heart of the Modist project is the assumption that there is a\ntriadic or parallel relationship between word, concept, and thing.\nMeaning is based proximately on understanding but ultimately on being.\nAccording to Thomas of Erfurt:\n\nEvery mode of signifying is from some property of the thing.\nConcerning the second thing to be noted, that since such notions or\nmodes of signifying are not fictions, it must be that every mode of\nsignifying radically originates from some property of the thing. This\nis plain thus: since the intellect, in order to signify, imposes the\nvoice under some mode of signifying, it considers the property itself\nof the thing from which it originally drew the mode of signifying;\nthis is because the intellect, since it is a passive power\nindeterminate of itself, does not advance to a determinate act unless\nit is determined from another source. Whence since it imposes the\nvoice in order to signify under the determinate mode of signifying, it\nis necessarily moved by a determinate property of the thing; therefore\nsome property of a thing, or mode of being of a thing, corresponds to\nany mode of signifying. (DMS, 2.4; Bursill-Hall: 3)\n\n\nNote the phrase, \u201csince such notions or modes of signifying are\nnot fictions.\u201d The modi significandi could not play any\ncausal role in determining the parts of speech, nor the corresponding\nmodi intelligendi in determining the modi\nsignificandi, nor the modi essendi in determining the\nmodi intelligendi, unless they all actually exist. Here the\nModistae drew on the Aristotelian idea that although spoken\nsounds and written marks differ from language to language, \u201cwhat\nthese are in the first place signs of \u2014 affections of the soul\n\u2014 are the same for all; and what these affections are likenesses\nof \u2014 actual things \u2014 are also the same\u201d (De\ninterpretatione\n 1.16a3\u20139).[14]\n Likewise, the ordering of modes was intended to replicate the\nordering of disciplines in an Aristotelian speculative science: just\nas psychology, the study of moving things qua animate, is\nsubordinate to physics, the study of things qua moving, and\nphysics is subordinate to metaphysics, the study of things\nqua existing, so the principles of grammar (modi\nsignificandi) are derived from mental acts of signifying\n(modi intelligendi), which reflect the way things really are\n(modi essendi).\n\nTidy conceptual schemes tend to become less so when confronted with\nthe empirical facts, and the Modistae spent a great deal of\ntime trying to explain recalcitrant linguistic data. After sketching\nthe origins of the modi significandi in the first chapters of\nhis treatise, Thomas immediately considers a few objections: how can\n\u2018goddess [dea]\u2019 be signified with a feminine\nnoun, which connotes passivity? Answer: a mode of signifying need not\nalways be drawn from the thing signified, for sometimes it \u201ccan\nbe taken from the property of the thing of another utterance;\u201d\nthus, when we say \u2018in God\u2019, we do not mean to attribute\npassivity to God, who suffers not, but only to \u201cimagine him as\nif being affected by our prayers.\u201d When we use a passive or\nfeminine mode of signifying in relation to God, what we are really\ndoing is signifying our own passive or feminine conception of some\nother thing that is a genuine recipient, i.e.,\nsomething that does correspond to a determinate mode of being\nqua recipient, and then imposing the same word to signify\nGod. In the same way, we impose names on things we cannot sense via\nthe properties of sensible things, thereby attributing \u201cactive\nmodes of signifying to their names\u201d (DMS 2.5;\nBursill-Hall: 4).\n\nBut what about words signifying fictions, such as\n\u2018chimera\u2019, or privations, such as \u2018blindness\u2019?\nThese do not correspond to any mode of being, active or passive, since\nthey signify nothing (i.e., no thing). According to Thomas, the active\nmodes of signifying chimeras \u201care taken from the parts from\nwhich we imagine a chimera to be composed, which [fiction] we imagine\nfrom the head of a lion, the tail of a dragon, etc\u201d\n(DMS 2.5; Bursill-Hall: 4). Names of privations, on the other\nhand, \u201cdesignate the modes of understanding of privations, which\nare their modes of being, through their own active modes of signifying\nabout privations\u201d. The idea here is that \u2018blindness\u2019\ncorresponds to our positive concept of sight qua absent,\nwhich enjoys a positive modus essendi in our intellects.\nThus, \u201calthough privations are not positive beings outside the\nsoul, they are nevertheless positive beings in the soul \u2026 and\nsince the understanding of them is their being, therefore, their mode\nof understanding would be their mode of being\u201d (DMS\n2.6; Bursill-Hall: 4). Blindness outside the soul cannot cause any\nconception of itself per se, since blindness per se\ndoes not exist, and what does not exist cannot be the cause of\nanything. Accordingly, when we say, \u2018Homer was a blind\nman,\u2019 the word \u2018blind\u2019 actively signifies the\npassive mode of understanding something as being without sight, and\nowes its semantic function to the way its corresponding concept is\nunderstood. In the case of concepts that are neither fictions nor\nprivations, these modes of understanding are further determined by\ntheir corresponding modes of being, i.e., by actual substances and\nproperties outside the soul.\n\nFor the Modistae, then, the words \u2018chimera\u2019 and\n\u2018horse\u2019 differ, but only in terms of the complexity of\ntheir underlying modes. Thomas follows Siger of Courtrai in\ndistinguishing between active and passive modi\nsignificandi/modi intelligendi to explain the difference\nbetween the act of signifying/understanding (materially construed as a\nproperty of the utterance/concept) and the object signified/understood\n(materially construed as a property of the thing\nsignified/understood). The fact that nothing answers to the name\n\u2018chimera\u2019 simply does not matter. Modism was a theory\nabout meaning (significatio) of a word as opposed to its\nreference (suppositio), and reference was regarded as\nsomething determined by logicians. Besides, if grammatical truths\nare universal and necessary \u2014 i.e., if there really is a science\nof grammar \u2014 then they cannot be altered by the fact that there\nare no chimeras. It is the assumption that some palpable phenomenon\nmust underlie every grammatical truth, causing it to be the way it is,\nwhich guides Thomas\u2019s discussion in the remainder of the treatise,\nwhich soon moves on to more practical matters such as the different\nparts of speech (\u2018Etymologia\u2019) and their syntax\n(\u2018Diasynthetica\u2019). Included in the latter are the\nconcepts of constructio (the syntactic joining of one word to\nanother), congruitas (the proper formation of such\nconstructions), and perfectio (the proper formation of\ncomplete expressions).\n\nModist explanations of semantic phenomena tended to be extremely\ncomplicated. Indeed, if we consider the manifold ways in which a word\ncan be a signifier together with its potential for combination with\nother words in expressions, there could be infinitely many modi\nsignificandi \u2014 a proliferation of modes repeated all over\nagain at the level of modi intelligendi. Philosophers today\nthink of Meinong\u2019s theory of objects as a paradigm of ontological\nincontinence. These philosophers have never met the Modistae,\nwho would make even Meinong seem parsimonious. But in a way this is\nunfair, of course, since the Modistae were not ontologists\nand had no interest in the ontological consequences of their theories.\nThey were first and foremost concerned with the phenomenon of\nlinguistic meaning, and invoked whatever entities they felt could best\nexplain what they observed.\n\nThomas\u2019s De modis significandi was the last work to develop\nModist doctrine to any significant\n degree.[15]\n Its clarity and relative brevity led to its adoption as the standard\nModist text in medieval universities, replacing the earlier Modi\nsignificandi of Martin of Dacia. But by 1330 and for reasons that\nremain unclear, Modism had completely disappeared from Paris, pushed\naside by the more powerful and comprehensive approach of the\nSummulae de dialectica of John Buridan (ca.\n 1300\u20131361).[16]\n Modism was never able to overcome certain difficulties, such as its\nrefusal to recognize extra-linguistic context, as a result of which it\ncould not explain how meaning can be communicated via incongruous or\nimperfect\n expressions.[17]\n But the most likely reason for its demise was that it no longer\nprovided satisfying explanations of the phenomena it was supposed to\nexplain. The one thing it could do, provide an account of the syntax\nof Latin grammar, could be achieved more economically by other means.\nIn addition, the theory became absurdly complicated in order to save\nthe phenomena of the modi significandi, suggesting that the\nmodi finally collapsed under their own weight, like so many\nPtolemaic epicycles.\n4. Influence\n\nThomas of Erfurt\u2019s De modis significandi has enjoyed more\nattention than it might otherwise have received thanks to its early\nmisidentification as a work of Duns\n Scotus.[18]\n As a result, it was printed along with authentic works on logic in\nvolume 1 of Luke Wadding\u2019s seventeenth-century edition of the\nOpera Omnia of Duns Scotus (Lyons 1639), and again in the\nnineteenth-century reprint of Wadding by Juan-Luis Viv\u00e8s (Paris\n 1891).[19]\n Until recently, the Wadding-Viv\u00e8s edition was the definitive\nsource for the works of Scotus, so anyone consulting it would have\nassociated De modis significandi with\n him.[20]\n Complicating the story somewhat is the fact that Scotus was\ninfluenced by Modism early in his career, though this was probably due\nto his exposure to Modist authors such as Simon of Faversham and\nAndrew of\n Cornwall.[21]\n It is unlikely that he was influenced by Thomas of Erfurt, because\nDe modis significandi did not circulate widely until after\nScotus\u2019s death.\n\nThomas of Erfurt had a famous contemporary, Meister Eckhart (c.\n1260\u20131328), the German Dominican philosopher and mystical\ntheologian. Meister Eckhart was not only present in Erfurt at roughly\nthe same time as Thomas, but also lived only a few streets away. It\nseems incredible that they could not have known each other personally\nand academically, though there is no explicit evidence that they did.\nDespite this, there is indirect evidence that Meister Eckhart was\ninfluenced by Thomas in his grammatical approach to interpreting\nscripture. Their intellectual relationship is the subject of a recent\nvolume of\n essays.[22]\n\n\nOne of the many later figures to have unwittingly admired Thomas was\nthe American philosopher, Charles Sanders Peirce (1839\u20131914),\nwho regarded Duns Scotus as a fellow traveler in metaphysics and whose\nown semiotic theory resembles the Modist program in certain\n respects.[23]\n Peirce quotes verbatim the first six chapters of De modis\nsignificandis in an 1869 lecture comparing (what he took to be)\nthe views of Duns Scotus and William of Ockham on names and\nsignification. But the lecture is introductory in character, leaving\nit uncertain whether Peirce fully appreciated what was at stake in\nModistic grammar, rather than viewing it, say, as some sort of\nlinguistic addendum to Scotus\u2019s\n metaphysics.[24]\n\nAnother figure so influenced was Martin Heidegger, whose\nHabilitationsschrift was published in 1916 under the title,\nDie Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus. This\nbook is only beginning to be studied by Heidegger scholars, which is a\npity because it is really about Heidegger\u2019s own project of advancing\nthe Husserlian notion of a priori grammar. A work of\nhistorical scholarship it is not. In what now seems a classic\nunderstatement, the historian of medieval philosophy Martin Grabmann\nwrote of this book in 1926, \u201cMartin Heidegger has demonstrated\nthe continuity of the Grammatica speculativa hitherto\nattributed to Duns Scotus with the terminology and overall\nintellectual outlook of Husserl, so that the structure and\ndistinctiveness of the medieval original is somewhat\n obscured\u201d.[25]\n In his defense, Heidegger never pretends to be doing history of\nphilosophy in Die Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns\nScotus. On the contrary, he states at the beginning of Part II\nthat he is mostly interested in exploring the implications of De\nmodis significandi for the broader theory of meaning, and that he\nis following scholarly consensus in attributing it to Duns\n Scotus.[26]\n\nIn 1922, however, Grabmann conclusively demonstrated that it was\nThomas of Erfurt who wrote De modis significandi, not Duns\n Scotus.[27]\n So the claim that Heidegger wrote his Habilitationsschrift\non Duns Scotus is only partly true. The first half, die\nKategorienlehre, is correctly addressed to Scotus\u2019s theory of the\ncategories as developed in his authentic commentaries on Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge, and Aristotle\u2019s Categories and De\nsophisticis elenchis. But the second half, die\nBedeutungslehre, is based almost entirely on Thomas of\n Erfurt.[28]\n\nFor more recent influence, we need look no further than Jacques\nDerrida, who mentions Thomas of Erfurt (this time dressed as himself)\nin connection with the old Peircean idea that logic is a branch of\nsemiotics: \u201cAs in Husserl (but the analogy, although it is most\nthought-provoking, would stop there and one must apply it carefully),\nthe lowest level, the foundation of the possibility of logic (or\nsemiotics) corresponds to the project of the Grammatica\nspeculativa of Thomas d\u2019Erfurt, falsely attributed to Duns\n Scotus\u201d (1976: 48).\n What impresses Derrida is not so much the reduction of logic to\ngrammar as the deconstructive potential of Husserl\u2019s phenomenology of\nsigns. The idea of deconstructing the science of language would have\nstruck Thomas as absurd, of course, though he probably would have felt\nsome affinity with the highly variegated notion of the sign in modern\nsemiotics. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Bursill-Hall, G.
