    "main_text": "\n\nOne task of metaphysics is to carve reality into\n categories.[1]\n Some things could have failed to exist; they fall under the category\ncontingent being. Some are events; they fall under\nevent. And so on. One might well wonder\u2014is there a\ncategory under which every thing falls? Offering an\ninformative account of such a category is no easy task. For nothing\nwould distinguish things that fall under it from those that\ndon\u2019t\u2014there being, after all, none of the latter. It seems\nhard, then, to say much about any fully general category; and it would\nappear to do no carving or categorizing or dividing at all.\nNonetheless there are candidates for such a fully general office,\nincluding thing, being, entity, item,\nexistent,\n\nand\u2014especially\u2014object.[2]\n\nIt is not obvious that there is any fully general category (whether\nobject or otherwise). Accordingly, not all accounts of\nobject assign it to a fully general category, instead\nallowing that there are non-objects. On those views, object\ndoes indeed divide.\n\nAccounts of object, then, differ with respect to whether\nthere are non-objects. And this is not the only fault line. Other\ndimensions of difference include what objects there are and\nwhat objects are. Accordingly, this entry will survey three\nbroad questions about the category object:\n\nWhat, if any, is its contrast or\ncomplement?\nWhat is its extension?\nWhat is its nature?\n\n\nEach of these questions admits of various specifications and answers\nthat we will consider in turn. Our focus will be largely theoretical\nand taxonomical, so we will only occasionally refer to historical\nsources. Our topic is abstract and broad, and touches on a number of\nissues in metaphysics that already enjoy coverage in this\nEncyclopedia. Our discussion of such topics will be brief; in\nthose cases, we will recommend consultation of the extant entries for\na more detailed treatment.\n",
