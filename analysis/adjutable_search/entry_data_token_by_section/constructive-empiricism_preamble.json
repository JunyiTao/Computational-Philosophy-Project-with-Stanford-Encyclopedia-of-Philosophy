    "main_text": "\n\nConstructive empiricism is the version of scientific anti-realism\npromulgated by Bas van Fraassen in his famous book The Scientific\nImage (1980). Van Fraassen defines the view as follows:\n\n\nScience aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and\nacceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically\nadequate. (1980, 12)\n\n\nWith his doctrine of constructive empiricism, van Fraassen is widely\ncredited with rehabilitating scientific anti-realism. There has been a\ncontentious debate within the philosophy of science community over\nwhether constructive empiricism is true or false. There is also some\nunclarity regarding what van Fraassen\u2019s arguments for the\ndoctrine actually are. In addition, there are controversies about what\nthe doctrine actually amounts to. While constructive empiricism has\nnot gained a wide number of adherents, it continues to be a highly\ninfluential doctrine in philosophy of science.\n",
