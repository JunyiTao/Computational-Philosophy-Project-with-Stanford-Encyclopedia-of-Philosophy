Conclusions, Open Issues, and Future Directions\n\nWhat can we conclude from this recounting of some of the more\nprominent recent attempts to construct models of scientific\nexplanation? What important issues remain open and what are the most\npromising directions for future work? Of course, any effort at\nstock-taking will reflect a particular point of view, but with this\ncaveat in mind, several observations seem plausible, even if not\ncompletely uncontroversial.\n",
