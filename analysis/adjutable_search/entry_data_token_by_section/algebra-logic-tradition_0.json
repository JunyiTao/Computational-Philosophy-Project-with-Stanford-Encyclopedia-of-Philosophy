Introduction\n\nBoole\u2019s The Mathematical Analysis of Logic presents many\ninteresting logic novelties: It was the beginning of\nnineteenth-century mathematization of logic and provided an\nalgorithmic alternative (via a slight modification of\nordinary algebra) to the catalog approach used in traditional\nlogic (even if reduction procedures were developed in the latter).\nInstead of a list of valid forms of argument, the validity of\narguments were determined on the basis of general principles and\nrules. Furthermore, it provided an effective method for proving\nlogical laws on the basis of a system of postulates. As Boole wrote\nlater, it was a proper \u201cscience of reasoning\u201d, and not a\n\u201cmnemonic art\u201d like traditional Syllogistics (Boole 1997:\n136).  Three-quarters of the way through this book, after finishing\nhis discussion of syllogistic logic, Boole started to develop the\ngeneral tools that would be used in his Laws of Thought\n(1854) to greatly extend traditional logic by permitting an argument\nto have many premises and to involve many classes. To handle the\ninfinitely many possible logical arguments of this expanded logic, he\npresented theorems that provided key tools for an algorithmic analysis\n(a catalog was no longer feasible).\n\nBoole\u2019s ideas were conceived independently of earlier anticipations,\nlike those developed by G.W. Leibniz. They emerged from the particular\ncontexts of English mathematics (see Peckhaus 2009). According to\nV\u00edctor S\u00e1nchez Valencia, the tradition that originated\nwith Boole came to be known as the algebra of logic since the\npublication in 1879 of Principles of the Algebra of Logic by\nAlexander MacFarlane (see S\u00e1nchez Valencia 2004: 389).\nMacFarlane considered \u201cthe analytical method of reasoning about\nQuality proposed by Boole\u201d as an algebra (see MacFarlane 1879:\n3).\n\nThis approach differs from what is usually called algebraic\nlogic; though there is some overlap, the historical development\nof the two areas are different. Algebraic logic is understood as:\n\n\na style [of logic] in which concepts and relations\nare expressed by mathematical symbols [\\(\\ldots\\)] so that\nmathematical techniques can be applied. Here mathematics shall mean\nmostly algebra, i.e., the part of mathematics concerned with finitary\noperations on some set. (Hailperin 2004: 323)\n\n\nAlgebraic logic can be already found in the work of Leibniz, Jacob\nBernoulli and other modern thinkers, and it undoubtedly constitutes an\nimportant antecedent of Boole\u2019s approach. In a broader perspective,\nboth are part of the tradition of symbolic knowledge in the\nformal sciences, as first conceived by Leibniz (see Esquisabel 2012).\nThis idea of algebraic logic was continued to some extent in the\nFrench Enlightenment in the work of Condillac and Condorcet (see\nGrattan-Guinness 2000: 14 ff.)\n\nBoole\u2019s methodology for dealing with logical problems can be described\nas follows:\n\nTranslate the logical data into suitable equations;\nApply algebraic techniques to solve these equations;\nTranslate this solution, if possible, back into the original\nlanguage.\n\n\nIn other words, symbolic formulation of logical problems and solution\nof logical equations constitutes Boole\u2019s method (see S\u00e1nchez\nValencia 2004: 389).\n\nLater, in his Pure Logic from 1864, Jevons changed Boole\u2019s\npartial operation of union of disjoint sets to the modern unrestricted\nunion and eliminated Boole\u2019s questionable use of uninterpretable terms\n(see Jevons 1890). Peirce (1880) eliminated explicitly the\nAristotelian derivation of particular statements from universal\nstatements by giving the modern meaning for \u201cAll \\(A\\) is\n\\(B\\)\u201d. In addition, he extended the algebra of logic for\nclasses to the algebra of logic for binary relations and introduced\ngeneral sums and products to handle quantification. Ernst\nSchr\u00f6der, taking inspiration from previous work by Hermann\n(1809\u20131877) and Robert Grassmann (1815\u20131901) and using the\nframework developed by Peirce, developed and systematized the\n19th Century achievements in the algebra of logic in his\nthree-volume work Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik\n(1890\u20131910).\n\nThe contributions of Gottlob Frege (1848\u20131925) to logic from the\nperiod 1879\u20131903, based on an axiomatic approach to\nlogic, had very little influence at the time (and the same can be said\nof the diagrammatic systems of C.S. Peirce developed at the\nturn of the century). Whitehead and Russell rejected the algebra of\nlogic approach, with its predominantly equational formulations and\nalgebraic symbolism, in favor of an approach strongly inspired by the\naxiomatic system of Frege, and using the notation developed by\nGiuseppe Peano, namely to use logical connectives, relation symbols\nand quantifiers.\n\nDuring the first two decades of the twentieth century, the algebra of\nlogic was further developed in the works of Platon Sergeevich\nPoretzsky (1846\u20131907), Louis Couturat (1868\u20131914), Leopold\nL\u00f6wenheim (1878\u20131957), and Heinrich Behmann\n(1891\u20131970) (see Styazhkin 1969). In particular, elimination\ntheorems in the algebra of logic influenced decision procedures for\nfragments of first-order and second-order logic (see Mancosu, Zach,\nBadesa 2009).\n\nAfter WWI David Hilbert (1862\u20131943), who had at first adopted\nthe algebraic approach, picked up on the approach of\nPrincipia, and the algebra of logic fell out of favor.\nHowever, in 1941, Tarski treated relation algebras as an equationally\ndefined class. Such a class has many models besides the collection\nof all binary relations on a given universe that was considered\nin the 1800s, just as there are many Boolean algebras besides the\npower set Boolean algebras studied in the 1800s. In the years\n1948\u20131952 Tarski, along with his students Chin and Thompson,\ncreated cylindric algebras as an algebraic logic companion to\nfirst-order logic, and in 1956 Paul Halmos (1916\u20132006)\nintroduced polyadic algebras for the same purpose. As Halmos (1956 b,\nc and d) noted, these new algebraic logics tended to focus on studying\nthe extent to which they captured first-order logic and on their\nuniversal algebraic aspects such as axiomatizations and structure\ntheorems, but offered little insight into the nature of the\nfirst-order logic which inspired their creation.\n",
