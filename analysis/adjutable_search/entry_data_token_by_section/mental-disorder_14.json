    "main_text": "Classification || Categorical and Dimensional Approaches\n6.2 Categorical and Dimensional Approaches\n\nPsychiatric classifications have often adhered, entirely or in part,\nto a nineteenth century, Kraepelinian model, where each disease is a\ndiscretely bounded entity, made up of a symptom cluster emanating from\nunderlying organic states or processes within the individual patient.\nBut the applicability of this model to mental disorder has been\nchallenged. Some would replace its idea of validity (involving a\nrelation between classificatory name and underlying disease) with the\nstatistical concept of predictive or prognostic validity, which\nproceeds without reference to underlying causes. Rather than\ndiscretely bounded, many disorders appear to be continuous with normal\nstates, and in an interpretive and definitional choice, over which the\ndata remains ambiguous, mental disorders arguably represent no more\nthan tails of normal distributions of particular traits in the general\npopulation \u2013 although the uniformity of these normal\ndistributions has also been questioned (Zachar 2014;Poland & Tekin\n2017; Machery 2017).\n\nSome diagnostic conditions (post-traumatic stress disorder, most\nunarguably) apparently arise from their subject\u2019s surrounding\nsocial, economic, and cultural context. Even those with more claim to\nidiopathic genetic, neurological, or biological causes as predisposing\nfactors are recognized to exhibit a course more strongly influenced by\nenvironmental and epigenetic than any fixed inherent factors \u2013\nthus putting further pressure on the \u201ccommon cause\u201d\nhypothesis, whereby a syndrome is explained by a single inherent\nfeature or set of features (Borsboom & Cramer 2013). Solely\ninternal, organic states and processes, and genes, cannot alone\nexplain all, and probably any, diagnostic disorders.\n\nWith their hypothesized common causes awaiting discovery, categorical\nanalyses present problems (such as the risk that allied symptoms may\nnot prove to emanate from a single common cause). But dimensional\napproaches make more evident the so-called boundary problem (Rashed\n2021) of where to assign the line between normal variation and\ndisorder. Theoretically, the \u201ccommon cause\u201d in categorical\nanalyses serves as an anchor uniting the often disparate and variable\nobservable symptoms making up a given disorder. (It is a feature that\njustifies the nomological approach of diagnostic classifications.)\nAside from this theoretical solution, categorical models are similarly\nbeset by boundary (fuzzy edges) problems. The presence of disorder is\npreceded and followed by a halo of prodromal and postdromal symptoms,\nover which clinical (and everyday) judgements are often unresolved.\nThese boundary issues remain regardless of the model adopted. In an\nexplicitly normative attempt to resolve an aspect of the boundary\nproblem as it occurs in social and political contexts, Mohammed Rashed\nemploys criteria governing recognition of social identities as a guide\nto pathological status (Rashed 2019, 2021).\n\nExpanding with each new addition, the collection of disorders\nenumerated and described in psychiatric classifications has prompted\nalarm over the boundaries of mental disorder, the erosion of normal,\nmentally healthy states and variations, and the inappropriate role\nplayed by medical psychiatry and, finally, science, in dictating norms\nof healthy psychic functioning. Philosophical criticisms of\n\u201cmedicalization\u201d emphasize the increasing influence of\nneuroscience in transforming cultural expectations and diminishing\nindividual agency, and the power over psychological norms exhibited by\nthe psychopharmacological industry (Phillips 2009, 2013; Rose &\nAbi-Rached 2013; Moncrieff 2008; Sadler 2005 , 2013, Whitaker &\nCosgrove 2015).\n\nIn contrast to these commonly-voiced apprehensions about\nover-medicalization, there remains the persistent charge of\nunder-diagnosis and under-treatment of those with\ndiagnosable mental disorder, often attributed to stigma, and to the\nsocioeconomic status of under-served communities. Epidemiological\nfindings about the incidence of disorder, as distinct from its\ndiagnosis, are notoriously insufficient, however, quite apart from a\nwant of independent biomarkers, due to self-stigma and fear of\ndiscrimination, for example, but also to distorting placebo effects,\nand to research methods misleadingly susceptible to false positives\n(Jopling 2009; Horwitz & Wakefield 2007; Poland & Von Eckardt\n2013)). The actual epidemiological data remains opaque and equivocal,\nleaving these contrary speculations unresolved and likely\nunresolvable.\n\nThe DSM and ICD diagnostic classifications have been remarkably\ninfluential worldwide: today, they appear almost immovably permanent.\nBut viewed within their broader moral, political, and social context,\nwhich includes psychiatry\u2019s apparently uneven provision of\neffective treatment, the appropriate stance to adopt towards them, as\nChristian Perring has pointed out, remains critical and skeptical\n(Perring 2016: 87).\n",
