    "main_text": "Critics of the Aristotelian science\n6. The influence of Abner\n\nOne must distinguish between two kinds of influence Abner had. Abner\ninfluenced with his polemical works the Jewish-Christian debate until\nthe end of the Middle Ages. Some born-Christians, like Alfonso de\nEspina, and especially Jewish apostates, like Pablo de Santa Maria,\nutilized his polemical works. Against this trend, there are more than\nfive Jewish polemicist works that explicitly answer the polemical\narguments of\n Abner.[23]\n Despite the utilization of Abner in debates, his works had almost no\nphilosophical influence on Christian theology because the Christian\nparticipants in the debates utilized the quotations of the Jewish\nsources by Abner and not his theological arguments as such, which in\ntheir content were very different from the official Catholic\ndogma.\n\nThe second way in which Abner had lasting influence was on the purely\nphilosophical plane. It should be noted that the direct philosophical\ninfluence of Abner was only on the Jewish community. In fact we do not\nsee that any Christian philosophers read the works of Jewish apostates\nin any other forum apart from the purely polemical one. By contrast,\nin the Jewish community the works of Abner had an important impact\nuntil the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. The deterministic\nopinion of Abner is with no doubt one of the major causes to the\nextensive number of works written on this subject in the\n14th and 15th centuries by Jewish philosophers.\nFor the most part, these works were against the opinion of Abner. The\nmost impressive philosophical influence of Abner was on Rabbi Hasdai\nCrescas (died in 1410/1411). Crescas was the main Jewish philosopher\nduring the end of the Middle Ages. Despite their opposite positions in\nthe Jewish-Christian debate (Crescas wrote one of the more\nphilosophical anti-Christian\n works),[24]\n Crescas borrowed some of the major original philosophical opinions of\nAbner, including determinism, the difference between the attributes of\nthe essence and the attributes that are essential, and the criticism\nof Aristotelian science. With regard to this entire subject, Crescas\nmolded his opinion using Abner combined with other sources. In spite\nof this important change, we can clearly see signs of the philosophy\nof Abner in the writing of Crescas, and these signs constitute nearly\nall the post medieval influence of Abner on Jewish and general Western\nphilosophy. \n",
