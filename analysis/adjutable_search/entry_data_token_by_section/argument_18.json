    "main_text": "Argumentation Across Fields of Inquiry and Social Practices || Argumentation in specific social practices\n4.5 Argumentation in specific social practices\n\nArgumentation is crucial in a number of specific organized social\npractices, in particular in politics, science, law, and education. The\nrelevant argumentative practices are studied in each of the\ncorresponding knowledge domains; indeed, while some general principles\nmay govern argumentative practices across the board, some may be\nspecific to particular applications and domains.\n\nAs already mentioned, argumentation is typically viewed as an\nessential component of political democratic practices, and as such it\nis of great interest to political scientists and political theorists\n(Habermas 1992 [1996]; Young 2000; Landemore 2013; Fishkin 2016; see\nentry on\n democracy).\n (The term typically used in this context is\n\u201cdeliberation\u201d instead of \u201cargumentation\u201d, but\nthese can be viewed as roughly synonymous for our purposes.) General\ntheories of argumentation such as pragma-dialectic and the Toulmin\nmodel can be applied to political argumentation with illuminating\nresults (Wodak 2016; Mohammed 2016). More generally, political\ndiscourse seems to have a strong argumentative component, in\nparticular if argumentation is understood more broadly as not only\npertaining to rational discourse (logos) but as also\nincluding what rhetoricians refer to as pathos and\nethos (Zarefsky 2014; Amossy 2018). But critics of\nargumentation and deliberation in political contexts also point out\nthe limitations of the classical deliberative model (Sanders 1997;\nTalisse 2019).\n\nMoreover, scientific communities seem to offer good examples of\n(largely) well-functioning argumentative practices. These are\ndisciplined systems of collective epistemic activity, with tacit but\nwidely endorsed norms for argumentative engagement for each domain\n(which does not mean that there are not disagreements on these very\nnorms). The case of mathematics has already been mentioned above:\npractices of mathematical proof are quite naturally understood as\nargumentative practices (Dutilh Novaes 2020a). Furthermore, when a\nscientist presents a new scientific claim, it must be backed by\narguments and evidence that her peers are likely to find convincing,\nas they follow from the application of widely agreed-upon scientific\nmethods (Longino 1990; Weinstein 1990; Rehg 2008; see entry on the\n social dimensions of scientific knowledge).\n Other scientists will in turn critically examine the evidence and\narguments provided, and will voice objections or concerns if they find\naspects of the theory to be insufficiently convincing. Thus seen,\nscience may be viewed as a \u201cgame of giving and asking for\nreasons\u201d (Zamora Bonilla 2006). Certain features of scientific\nargumentation seem to ensure its success: scientists see other\nscientists as prima facie peers, and so (typically at least) place a\nfair amount of trust in other scientists by default; science is based\non the principle of \u201corganized skepticism\u201d (a term\nintroduced by the pioneer sociologist of science Robert Merton [Merton, 1942]), which\nmeans that asking for further reasons should not be perceived as a\npersonal attack. These are arguably aspects that distinguish\nargumentation in science from argumentation in other domains in virtue\nof these institutional factors (Mercier & Heintz 2014). But\nultimately, scientists are part of society as a whole, and thus the\nquestion of how scientific and political argumentation intersect\nbecomes particularly relevant (Kitcher 2001).\n\nAnother area where argumentation is essential is the law, which also\ncorresponds to disciplined systems of collective activity with rules\nand principles for what counts as acceptable arguments and evidence.\n \nIn litigation (in particular in adversarial justice systems), there\nare typically two sides disagreeing on what is lawful or just, and the\nbasic idea is that each side will present its strongest arguments; it\nis the comparison between the two sets of arguments that should lead\nto the best judgment (Walton 2002). Legal reasoning and argumentation\nhave been extensively studied within jurisprudence for decades, in\nparticular since Ronald Dworkin\u2019s (1977) and Neil\nMacCormick\u2019s (1978) responses to HLA Hart\u2019s highly\ninfluential The Concept of Law (1961). A number of other\nviews and approaches have been developed, in particular from the\nperspectives of natural law theory, legal positivism, common law, and\nrhetoric (see Feteris 2017 for an overview). Overall, legal\nargumentation is characterized by extensive uses of analogies (Lamond\n2014), abduction (Askeland 2020), and defeasible/non-monotonic\nreasoning (Bex & Verheij 2013). An interesting question is whether\nargumentation in law is fundamentally different from argumentation in\nother domains, or whether it follows the same overall canons and norms\nbut applied to legal topics (Raz 2001).\n\nFinally, the development of argumentative skills is arguably a\nfundamental aspect of (formal) education (Muller Mirza &\nPerret-Clermont 2009). Ideally, when presented with arguments, a\nlearner should not simply accept what is being said at face value, but\nshould instead reflect on the reasons offered and come to her own\nconclusions. Argumentation thus fosters independent, critical\nthinking, which is viewed as an important goal for education (Siegel\n1995; see entry on\n critical thinking).\n A number of education theorists and developmental psychologists have\nempirically investigated the effects of emphasizing argumentative\nskills in educational settings, with encouraging results (Kuhn &\nCrowell 2011). There has been in particular much emphasis on\nargumentation specifically in science education, based on the\nassumption that argumentation is a key component of scientific\npractice (as noted above); the thought is that this feature of\nscientific practice should be reflected in science education (Driver,\nNewton, & Osborne 2000; Erduran & Jim\u00e9nez-Aleixandre\n2007).\n",
