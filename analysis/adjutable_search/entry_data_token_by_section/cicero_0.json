    "main_text": "Cicero\u2019s Life and Times\n1. Cicero\u2019s Life and Times\n\nThere are a number of good studies of Cicero\u2019s life (e.g.\nFuhrmann 1992, Rawson 1994, Tempest 2011); some background knowledge\nis salient to an understanding of his philosophical outlook. As\nalready mentioned, Cicero lived through a turbulent historical period.\nUnder the strains of empire, the Roman republican system of government\nhad fractured, and was eventually to prove unsustainable. Cicero was\nboth witness to and participant in some of the events that hastened\nthe collapse of republican government and that ushered in, within\nfifteen years or so of his death, the rule of Augustus, first of the\nRoman emperors.\n\nCicero rose to the highest political office in the republic \u2013\nthe consulship \u2013 in 63 BCE. His period as consul was both the\nhigh-water mark of his political career and a fateful turning-point.\nWhile consul, he put down the conspiracy against the republic led by\nCatiline. But his actions led to his being exiled in 58; and, while he\nwas restored to Rome the following year through the influence of\nPompey, he could do little other than contemplate with horror the\ndeterioration of relations between Caesar and Pompey that led to civil\nwar and the ascendancy of Caesar to the dictatorship. Caesar\u2019s\nassassination in 44 brought only brief respite. Cicero himself was put\nto death on Mark Antony\u2019s orders in 43.\n",
