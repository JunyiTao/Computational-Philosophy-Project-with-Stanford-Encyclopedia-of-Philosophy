    "main_text": "Objections to Deflationism || Inflationist Deflationism?\n4.8 Inflationist Deflationism?\n\nAnother objection to deflationism begins by drawing attention to a\nlittle-known doctrine about truth that G.E. Moore held at the\nbeginning of the 20th Century. Richard Cartwright (1987, 73) describes\nthe view as follows: \u201ca true proposition is one that has a\ncertain simple unanalyzable property, and a false proposition is one\nthat lacks the property\u201d. This doctrine about truth is to be\nunderstood as the analogue for the doctrine that Moore held about\ngoodness, namely that goodness is a simple, unanalyzable quality.\n\nThe potential problem that this Moorean view about truth presents for\ndeflationism might best be expressed in the form of a question: What\nis the difference between the Moorean view and deflationism? One might\nreply that, according to deflationary theories, the concept of truth\nhas an important logical role, i.e., expressing certain\ngeneralizations, whereas the concept of goodness does not. However,\nthis doesn\u2019t really answer our question. For one thing, it\nisn\u2019t clear that Moore\u2019s notion of truth does not also\ncapture generalizations, since it too will yield all of the instances\nof (ES). For another, the idea that the concept of truth plays an\nimportant logical role doesn\u2019t distinguish the metaphysics of\ndeflationary conceptions from the metaphysics of the Moorean view, and\nit is the metaphysics of the matter that the present objection really\nbrings into focus. Alternatively, one might suggest that the\ndistinction between truth according to Moore\u2019s view and\ndeflationary conceptions of truth is the distinction between having a\nsimple unanalyzable nature, and not having any underlying nature at\nall. But what is that distinction? It is certainly not obvious that\nthere is any distinction between having a nature about which nothing\ncan be said and having no nature at all.\n\nHow might a deflationist respond to this alleged problem? The key move\nwill be to focus on the property of being true. For the Moorean, this\nproperty is a simple unanalyzable one. But deflationists need not be\ncommitted to this. As we have seen, some deflationists think that\nthere is no truth property at all. And even among deflationists who\naccept that there is some insubstantial truth property, it is not\nclear that this is the sort of property that the Moorean has in mind.\nTo say that a property is unanalyzable suggests that the property is a\nfundamental property. One might understand this in something like the\nsense that Lewis proposes, i.e., as a property that is sparse and\nperfectly natural. Or one might understand a fundamental property as\none that is groundable but not grounded in anything. But deflationists\nneed not understand a purported property of being true in either of\nthese ways. As noted in Section 1.2, they may think of it as an\nabundant property rather than a sparse one, or as one that is\nungroundable. In this way, there are options available for\ndeflationists who want to distinguish themselves from the Moorean view\nof truth.\n",
