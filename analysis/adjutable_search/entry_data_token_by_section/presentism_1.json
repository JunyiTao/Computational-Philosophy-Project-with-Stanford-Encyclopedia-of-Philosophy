    "main_text": "Motivating Presentism\n2. Motivating Presentism\n\nThe most frequently cited reason given for endorsing\npresentism\u2014or, at least, treating it as worthy of serious\ncritical consideration\u2014trades upon some variant of the claim\nthat it\u2019s the \u201cintuitive\u201d or \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d view of time (e.g., Bigelow 1996: 36; Sider 2001: 11;\nMarkosian 2004: 48; De Clercq 2006: 386; Tallant 2009b: 407; Ingram\n2019: 39\u201343). Many friends agree, and more than a few foes\nconcede, that there\u2019s something compelling about the ideas that\npresent things really exist, whilst past and future things don\u2019t\nexist, and that some things begin to exist, and other things cease to\nexist (cf. Sullivan 2012: 153\u201365). Some who look to defend\npresentism will rest there with the bare claim that presentism is\nintuitive (etc.) and that this gives us reason to think that\nit\u2019s true.\n\nOne way to proceed is to extend this idea. Begin with the intuition\nthat there\u2019s something special about the\npresent\u2014something distinctive. This seems attractive enough. But\nhow might we capture it in our metaphysical model of time? One way to\ndo it is to assert that present things are the only things that exist,\nthat is, to endorse the presentist\u2019s ontic thesis. Certainly,\nthis marks the present as distinctive. And, to the extent that we wish\nto capture and preserve the idea that the present is\n\u201cspecial\u201d (in some sense), presentism fares well against\nthis measure. But, of course, any model that privileges the\npresent in some way or other will fare well against the same measure\n(such as the growing block theory, which states that the present is\nspecial in virtue of being the latest moment of existence). So, for\nthis argument to motivate presentism fully, further argument must be\ngiven for thinking that rival views don\u2019t come up to\nscratch.\n\nAnother way to motivate presentism is via appeal to experience. To\nborrow a famous example, consider a headache (e.g., Zimmerman 1998:\n212). If a headache exists, it hurts. It can\u2019t exist and fail to\nhurt. Now, suppose that we endorse the existence of the past (and deny\npresentism). Past headaches exist. But they don\u2019t hurt (at\nleast, so goes the claim). If headaches from hangovers last year hurt\nus, neither author would be in a position to write this, so severe\nwould be the pain. Since headaches must hurt, if they\nexist\u2014it\u2019s part of their essence to do so\u2014past\nheadaches cannot exist. This goes for the future headaches as well.\nThus, presentism is true. (For the classic statement of the\n\u201cthank goodness that\u2019s over\u201d argument, in favor of A\ntheories of time, see A.N. Prior 1959. The wider literature is\nvoluminous. Representative recent works include: Suhler &\nCallender 2012; Hoerl 2015; Pearson 2018.)\n\nThere are different examples that draw upon our experience of pain and\nour attitude towards it. Consider again a past headache and compare it\nto a (possible) future headache, something that may result from\noverenthusiastic behavior in the bar this evening. A future headache\nis something that worries us. It influences our behavior. We seek to\navoid it. We may even fear it. By contrast, we feel differently about\npast headaches (and past pains, generally). We don\u2019t fear past\npains. They don\u2019t worry us in quite the same way. One\nexplanation for this is that a past pain doesn\u2019t exist. Whilst a\nfuture pain doesn\u2019t exist either, we know that it will exist if\nwe behave in such-and-such a way. It\u2019s the potential for that\nheadache to exist (to come into being) that causes us to modify our\nbehavior. We wish to avoid that state. But if we think that past and\nfuture things exist, we cannot appeal to the explanation just given,\nfor if the past headache exists, presumably we should fear it or worry\nabout it, just as we should if a future headache exists. (For a brief,\ngeneral discussion of connections between time and rationality, see\nthe entry on\n time:\n \u00a712. For further reading on \u2018time biases\u2019 \u2014\nsuch as \u2018future bias\u2019, where an agent prefers that bad or\npainful experiences be in the past and that good or pleasurable\nexperiences be in the future \u2014 see, e.g., Hare 2007, 2013;\nSullivan 2017, 2018; Bnefsi 2020; Fernandes 2021.)\n\nLast, but not least, we might motivate presentism by appealing to\nontological parsimony (e.g., Bourne 2006: 68\u201369). Suppose that\nwe endorse something like \u201cOckham\u2019s razor\u201d,\nviz. the principle that one shouldn\u2019t multiply entities\nbeyond necessity (see the entry on\n  simplicity>,\n esp. \u00a72). By asserting that only present things exist, i.e., by\nnot positing the existence of any non-present things, the\npresentist\u2019s ontology is more parsimonious than the ontology of\ntheir opponents (e.g., growing block theorists posit the existence of\npast and present things, eternalists posit the existence of past,\npresent, and future things, etc.). All things being equal, we have at\nleast a defeasible preference for presentism over its rivals, if we\nhave a taste for ontological desert landscapes.\n\nThere are a number of complications with this way of motivating\npresentism. For one thing, although it\u2019s typical (in\nmetaphysics) to see appeals to ontological parsimony in cases where\none view is more \u201cqualitatively\u201d parsimonious\nthan its rivals, that is, cases where a view posits fewer\nkinds of thing than opposing views, it\u2019s far less\ntypical to see appeals in cases where one view is merely more\n\u201cquantitatively\u201d parsimonious than rivals, that\nis, cases where a view posits fewer things than another. The fact that\nappeals to quantitative parsimony are less typical reflects a general\nattitude that the only ontological parsimony that one ought to respect\nis qualitative parsimony. As David Lewis famously puts it:\n\n\nI subscribe to the general view that qualitative parsimony is good in\na philosophical or empirical hypothesis; but I recognize no\npresumption whatever in favor of quantitative parsimony (1973: 87)\n\n\nNow, it seems that if presentism is to be motivated by appeal to\nparsimony, then it must be motivated by appeal to considerations of\nquantitative parsimony. Presentism and eternalism don\u2019t\ndisagree about the kinds of things that exist. Both\npresentists and non-presentists tend to agree on the metaphysical\nkinds (or \u201contological categories\u201d) that exist. What they\ndisagree about is the temporal location of the things that exist.\nPresentism states that everything exists at the present time;\neternalism states that there are things that exist at other times. If\npresentism is to be motivated in this way, then we must justify a\npreference for quantitative parsimony in this case in the face of the\northodoxy that Lewis expresses. (See Tallant 2013 for an attempt to\ndeliver this sort of argument for presentism. For arguments that\njustify quantitative parsimony as a theoretical virtue, more\ngenerally, see Nolan 1997; Baker 2003; Jansson & Tallant\n2017.)\n\nAt the outset, we noted that presentism has been formulated,\ndeveloped, and modified in response to a range of objections. In what\nremains of this entry, we consider what we take to be the most\nprominent and well-developed of these objections and explain how\npresentists have tried to respond (\u00a7\u00a73\u20138).\n",
