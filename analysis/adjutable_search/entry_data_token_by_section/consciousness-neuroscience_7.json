    "main_text": "Methods for Tracking Consciousness || Introspection and Report\n2.1 Introspection and Report\n\nScientists primarily study phenomenal consciousness through subjective\nreports. We can treat reports in neuroscience as conceptual in that\nthey express how the subject recognizes things to be, whether\nregarding what they perceive (perceptual or observational reports, as\nin psychophysics) or regarding what mental states they are in\n(introspective reports). A report\u2019s conceptual content can be\nconveyed in words or through another overt behavior whose significance\nis fixed within an experimental context (e.g., pressing a button to\nindicate that a stimulus is present or that one sees it). Subjective\nreports of conscious states draw on distinctively first-personal\naccess to that state. The subject introspects.\n\nIntrospection raises questions that science has only recently begun to\naddress systematically in large part because of longstanding suspicion\nregarding introspective methods. Early modern psychology relied on\nintrospection to parse mental processes but ultimately abandoned it\ndue to worries about introspection\u2019s reliability (Feest 2012;\nSpener forthcoming). Introspection was judged to be an unreliable\nmethod for addressing questions about mental processing. To address\nthese worries, we must understand how introspection works, but unlike\nmany other psychological capacities, we lack detailed models of\nintrospection of consciousness (Feest 2014; for theories of\nintrospecting propositional attitudes, see Nichols & Stich 2003;\nGoldman 2006; Heal 1996; Carruthers 2011). This makes it difficult to\naddress long-standing worries about introspective reliability\nregarding consciousness.\n\nIn science, questions raised about the reliability of a method are\nanswered by calibrating and testing the method. This calibration has\nnot been done with respect to the type of introspection commonly\npracticed by philosophers. Such introspection has revealed many\nphenomenal features that are targets of active investigation such as\nthe phenomenology of mineness (Ehrsson 2009), sense of agency (Bayne\n2011; Vignemont & Fourneret 2004; Marcel 2003; Horgan, Tienson,\n& Graham 2003); transparency (Harman 1990; Tye 1992),\nself-consciousness (Kriegel 2003: 122), cognitive phenomenology (Bayne\n& Montague 2011); phenomenal unity (Bayne & Chalmers 2003)\namong others. A scientist might worry that philosophical introspection\nmerely recycles rejected methods of a century ago, indeed without the\nstringent controls or training imposed by earlier psychologists. How\ncan we ascertain and ensure the reliability of introspection in the\nempirical study of consciousness?\n\nOne way to address the issue is to connect introspection to attention.\nPhilosophical conceptions of introspective attention construe it as\ncapable of directly focusing on phenomenal properties and experiences.\nAs this idea is fleshed out, however, it is clearly not a form of\nattention studied by cognitive science, for the posited direct\nintrospective attention is neither perceptual attention nor what\npsychologists call internal attention (e.g., the retrieval of thought\ncontents as in memory recollection; (Chun, Golomb, & Turk-Browne\n2011)). Calibrating introspection as it is used in the science of\nconsciousness would benefit from concrete models of introspection,\nmodels we lack (see Spener 2015, for a general form of\ncalibration).\n\nOne philosophical tradition links introspection to perceptual\nattention, and this allows construction of concrete models informed by\nscience. The intuitive idea is expressed in Harman\u2019s\nobservation:\n\n\nLook at a tree and try to turn your attention to intrinsic features of\nyour visual experience. I predict you will find that the only features\nthere to turn your attention to will be features of the presented\ntree, including relational features of the tree \u201cfrom\nhere\u201d. (Harman 1990: 39) \n\n\nThis is related to a proposal inspired by Gareth Evans (1982): in\nintrospecting perceptual states, say judging that one sees an object,\none draws on the same perceptual capacities used to answer the\nquestion whether the object is present. In introspection, one then\nappends a further concept of \u201cseeing\u201d to one\u2019s\nperceptual\n report.[4]\n Thus, instead of simply reporting that a red stimulus is present, one\nreports that one sees the red stimulus. Paradoxically, introspection\nrelies on externally directed perceptual attention, but as noted\nearlier, identifying what one perceives is a way of characterizing\nwhat one\u2019s perception is like, so this \u201coutward\u201d\nperspective can provide information about the inner. Further, the\nadvantage of this proposal is that questions of reliability come down\nto questions of the reliability of psychological capacities that can\nbe empirically assessed, say perceptual, attentional and conceptual\nreliability. For example, Peters and Lau (2015) showed that accuracy\nin judgments about the visibility of a stimulus, the introspective\nmeasure, coincided with accuracy in judgments about stimulus\nproperties, the objective measure (see also Rausch & Zehetleitner\n2016).\n\nIntrospection can be reliable. Successful clinical practice relies on\naccurate introspection as when dealing with pain or correcting blurry\nvision in optometry. The success of medical interventions suggests\nthat patient reports of these phenomenal states are reliable. Further,\nin many of the examples to be discussed, the perceptual\nattention-based account provides a plausible cognitive model of\nintrospection. Subjects report on what they perceptually experience by\nattending to the object of their experience, and where perception and\nattention are reliable, a plausible hypothesis is that their\nintrospective judgments will be reliable as well. Accordingly, I\nassume the reliability of introspection in the empirical studies to be\ndiscussed. Still, given that no scientist should assert the\nreliability of a method without calibration, introspection must be\nsubject to the same standards. There is more work to be done.\n",
