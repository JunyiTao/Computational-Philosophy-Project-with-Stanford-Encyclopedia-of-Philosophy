    "main_text": "Interpretations of Qing || Qing as Nature, Essence or Genuineness\n3.1 Qing as Nature, Essence or Genuineness\n\nGraham (1990: 59) argues that qing should never be\ninterpreted as feelings or passions (i.e., inner subjective states of\nthe mind) in early Chinese philosophy. According to him, the\ninternalized or psychologized meanings of qing became fully\nand explicitly available later in the Song dynasty (960 CE and after)\nwhen qing is paired with xing (\u6027 objective nature\nor essence) in Neo-Confucian metaphysics. He states that qing\nas a noun in the context of pre-Han literature means \u201c\u2019the\nfacts\u2019\u2026as an adjective \u2018genuine\u2019\u201d.\nHowever, he explains in the contexts of the Xunzi and the\nLiji how qing is associated with emotions as\nexpressions of genuine of human nature. He (1990: 64) states that \n\n\nIn these texts [the Xunzi and the Liji], but nowhere\nelse in pre-Han literature, the word [qing] refers only to\nthe genuine in man which it is polite to disguise, and therefore to\nhis feelings. \n\n\nAccording to him, Xunzi uses qing in the sense of the genuine\nor essential nature and explained its affective expressions from the\nviewpoint where the nature of human beings can be found in inner\naffective states. In this way, Graham defends his interpretation of\nqing as essence or genuineness even in the contexts of\nsubjective feelings in some early Chinese texts.\n",
