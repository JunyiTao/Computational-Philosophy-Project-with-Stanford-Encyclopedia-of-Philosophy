    "main_text": "The Roots of Set Theory\n1. The Roots of Set Theory\n\n\nThere are various forces that gave rise to set theory, and various\nforces that sustain it and drive it on. The following two conceptions\nof set overlap but do not entirely coincide.\n\nThe notion of arbitrary set grew in the late 19th century\nfrom developments in analysis, somewhat in the way that the concept of\narbitrary real-valued function had grown earlier in the century. To\nthis day there are people who feel that the centre ground of set\ntheory lies in Analysis.\nA second idea is that of sets as one extensional (in the sense\nof the intension/extension distinction) limb (the others being lists\nand multisets) of a body whose intensional limbs are\nfunction-in-intension, properties, algorithm. (Sets as\nproperties-in-extension is not a completely straightforward story: the\npoint has been made that much of the heartsearching occasioned by the\nemergence of the Axiom of Choice as a principle of set existence arose\nprecisely because sometimes the sets it postulated seemed not to be the\nextension of any property. But this is to make the same point in a\nback-handed way: it shows that people were expecting sets to be\nextensions of known intensions.)\n\n\n\nIf we think of sets as extensions, what are the corresponding\nintensions? The answer must surely be: one-place predicates. (Solace\nfor the distractible: \u201cSo what are the extensions corresponding to\nmany-place predicates?\u201d The answer is not to worry; whatever you\nthink they ought to be, you can fake them with ordered tuples and\nsets).\n\n\nFrom our point of view, this is an interesting analysis, because on\nthis account of set, we clearly ought to believe in an axiom of\ncomplementation for sets. If you think that a negation of a proposition\nis a proposition (so that in particular a negation of an atomic\nproposition is a proposition) then you also believe that a negation (or\ncomplement or whatever you want to call it) of a predicate is another\npredicate. Notice that this doesn\u2019t tell you that your complementation\nhas to be classical, but it does tell you that a complement of a set\nshould be a set. This will turn out to be one of the axioms of NF.\n\n\nSets are just extensional entities with particular multiplicity\nproperties (that mark them off from multisets) and certain\nfunctionalities (that mark them off from functions-in-extension, graphs\netc). Among the variety of objects in the extensional canon, sets are\ndistinguished by their almost complete absence of structure. This\npoints to one of the most perplexing but prominent r\u00f4les of set\ntheory in modern mathematics. Almost any (indeed many people believe\nliterally any) fact in mathematics can be construed as a fact\nabout sets.\n\n\nThe idea that sets are extensions manifests itself in the idea (to\nwhich we will return) that set theory is the theory of one binary\nextensional relation (parallel to graph theory as the theory of a\nsingle symmetric irreflexive relation). Useful though this idea will\nturn out to be, it does not suggest any particular axioms for Set\ntheory.\n\n\nAxioms of set theory have arisen in part out of our understanding of the\nparadoxes. The most striking feature of the paradoxes is something\nvulgarly called \u201cself-reference\u201d, and ideas about how to\ndeal with it have been a useful constraint on our invention of axioms\nfor set theory. The search for a spell to ward off the evils attendant\nupon self-reference has fed into the axiomatisation of set theory in\ntwo ways, corresponding to the two ways in which self-reference has\nbeen (mis)-understood. Is it circularity in the specification\nof sets that is to be eschewed? Or do we locate the problem in\ncircularity in the membership relation between sets? At all\nevents, we have to be careful to keep to a minimum the number of\nsinews we cut, for there are important theorems (G\u00f6del\u2019s\nIncompleteness theorem among others) whose proofs rely on the same\n\u201cself-reference\u201d that we find in the paradoxes but which\nwe are loath to abandon.\n",
