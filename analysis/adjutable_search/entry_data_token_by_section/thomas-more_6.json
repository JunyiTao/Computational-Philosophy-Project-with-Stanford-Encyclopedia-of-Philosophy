In\n1518 he again publicly defended philosophy, specifically Greek\nphilosophy, in the curriculum at Oxford University (29 March\n<1518> letter to Oxford University [EW\n419.59\u201362]). Around 1518, More also included philosophy in the\ncurriculum for his children (<1518> letter to Gonell\n[EW 289.6]), and his daughters went on to dispute philosophy\nbefore Henry VIII in 1526 (<1526> letter from John Palsgrave\n[Corr 405.76\u201377]). His daughter Margaret devoted\nherself \u201cdiligently to philosophy\u201d, a course of studies\nthat More encouraged along with \u201cmedical science and sacred\nliterature\u201d but without neglecting \u201chumane letters and\nso-called liberal studies\u201d because in these latter studies in\nparticular \u201ca good judgment is formed or perfected\u201d\n(<1521> letter to Margaret Roper [EW\n314.50\u201380]).\n\nIn the letter to his children\u2019s tutor William Gonell (c. 1518),\nMore pointed out that the \u201cmost learned\u201d of the\nphilosophers serve usefully as \u201cguides of human life\u201d\n(EW 289.4\u20136), and that wisdom is an important objective\nof education, depending, as he believed, \u201con the inner knowledge\nof what is right [recti conscientia]\u201d\u2014or, in a\nmore accurate translation, \u201con a right conscience\u201d\n(EW 288.75\u201377). Another major objective of education is\nan inward \u201ccalm and \u2026 peace\u201d allowing a person to\nbe\n\n\nneither stirred by praise of flatterers nor stung by the follies of\nunlearned mockers of learning [neque ridentium literas\nilliteratorum mordeantur ineptiis]. (EW\n289.78\u201383)\n\n\nTowards these ends, More gave a special place to the classical authors\nbut also to the Bible and the Church Fathers (EW\n290.65\u201377).\n\nLater, More would again emphasize the special importance that should\nbe given to Greek writings\u2014classical, biblical, and patristic\n(<1518> letter to Oxford [EW 419\u201320]\u2014while\nalso recognizing the important contributions of Cicero, Seneca, the\nLatin Church Fathers (EW 419.13\u201314, 60), as well as\nThomas Aquinas, \u201cthat most learned and also most holy man\u201d\n(Response to Luther, Book 1 [CW 5: 355.23\u20134]),\n\u201cthe very flower of theology, and a man of that true perfect\nfaith and Christian living\u201d (The Confutation of\nTyndale\u2019s Answer [CW 8: 713.21, 14]).\n",
