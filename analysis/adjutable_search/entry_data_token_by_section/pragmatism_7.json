    "main_text": "Pragmatist Epistemology || Inquiry\n4.2 Inquiry\n\nPragmatist epistemologies often explore how we can carry out inquiries\nin a self-controlled and fruitful way. (Where much analytic\nepistemology centres around the concept of knowledge,\nconsidered as an idealised end-point of human thought, pragmatist\nepistemology centres around the concept of inquiry, considered\nas the process of knowledge-seeking and how we can improve it.) So\npragmatists often provide rich accounts of the capacities or virtues\nthat we must possess in order to inquire well, and the rules or\nguiding principles that we should adopt. A canonical account is\nPeirce\u2019s classic early paper \u201cThe Fixation of\nBelief\u201d. Here Peirce states that inquiry is a struggle to\nreplace doubt with \u2018settled belief\u2019, and that the only\nmethod of inquiry that can make sense of the fact that at least some\nof us are disturbed by inconsistent beliefs, and will subsequently\nreflect upon which methods of fixing belief are correct is\nthe Method of Science, which draws on the Pragmatic Maxim\ndescribed above. This contrasts with three other methods of fixing\nbelief: i) refusing to consider evidence contrary to one\u2019s\nfavored beliefs (the Method of Tenacity), ii) accepting an\ninstitution\u2019s dictates (the Method of Authority), iii)\ndeveloping the most rationally coherent or elegant-seeming belief-set\n(the A Priori Method). Notable recent reinterpretations and\ndefenses of Peircean pragmatist epistemology include (Haack 1993 and\nCooke 2007). (See also Skagestad 1981.)\n\nDewey\u2019s conception of inquiry, found in his Logic: the\nTheory of Inquiry is also rich, and arguably more radical than\nPeirce\u2019s in its underlying ontology (ED2: 169\u201379). Dewey\nsees inquiry as beginning with a problem; it aims for \u2018the\ncontrolled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation\ninto one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and\nrelations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a\nunified whole\u2019 (ED2: 171). As John E. Smith notes, where\n\u2018Peirce aimed at \u201cfixing\u201d belief, Dewey aimed at\n\u201cfixing\u201d the situation\u2019 (1978: 98). It is important\nto note that here the situation is objectively indeterminate,\nand is itself transformed by inquiry. The \u2018pattern of\ninquiry\u2019 that Dewey describes is common to the\ninformation-gathering of animals, practical problem solving, common\nsense investigations of our surroundings and scientific inquiry. He\nrecognizes that when we face a problem, our first task is to\nunderstand it through describing its elements and identifying their\nrelations. Identifying a concrete question that we need to answer is a\nsign that we are making progress. And the \u2018logical forms\u2019\nwe use in the course of inquiry are understood as ideal instruments,\ntools that help us to transform things and resolve our problem. The\ncontinuities Dewey finds between different kinds of inquiry are\nevidence of his naturalism and his recognition that forms of\nscientific investigation can guide us in all areas of our lives. All\nthe pragmatists, but most of all Dewey, challenge the sharp dichotomy\nthat other philosophers draw between theoretical beliefs and practical\ndeliberations. In some sense, all inquiry is practical, concerned with\ntransforming and evaluating the features of situations in which we\nfind ourselves. Shared inquiry directed at resolving social and\npolitical problems or indeterminacies was also central to\nDewey\u2019s conception of the good life and, relatedly, the\ndemocratic ideal. (Recently other pragmatists, closer to Peirce than\nDewey, have developed this idea: see for instance Talisse 2008; Misak\n1999; Westbrook 1991.)\n",
