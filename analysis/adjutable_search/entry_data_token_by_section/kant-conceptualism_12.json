    "main_text": "Points of Dispute || The \u2018Blindness\u2019 of Intuition\n5.3 The \u2018Blindness\u2019 of Intuition\n\nPerhaps the most obvious objection to the Sensibilist reading of\nintuition as autonomous from the intellect stems from Kant\u2019s\nfamous statement that\n\n\nIntuition and concepts therefore constitute the elements of all our\ncognition [Erkenntnis] \u2026 Thoughts without content\n[Inhalt] are empty, intuitions without concepts are\nblind\u2026 The understanding is not capable of intuiting anything,\nand the senses are not capable of thinking anything. Only from their\nunification can cognition arise. (A50\u201351/B74\u201375)\n\n\nThe so-called \u201cblindness\u201d problem raises two issues:\nfirst, that intuitions without concepts or conceptual synthesis are\nnot intentional states (George 1981; Pereboom 1988; Gr\u00fcne 2009)\nand so cannot provide the mind with relation to an object and, second,\nthat we cannot even identify the cognitive contribution made\nby sensory experience independent of its conceptualization\n(Falkenstein 1995; McDowell 1996: 51; Pippin 2005; cf. Bird 2006: ch.\n7.2).\n\nConcerning the first point, one question is whether Kant is really\nconcerned with the conditions of intentionality per se (Van\nCleve 1999: 95\u201397), or merely with the conditions under which a\ncertain kind of rational relation to objects is possible, one that\ncould support rational cognition and the acquisition of scientific\nknowledge. On this latter reading Kant\u2019s talk of \u201crelation\nto an object\u201d takes on a specific and technical significance\nthat should not be confused with intentionality per se (Hanna\n2005; Allais 2015: ch. 7; McLear 2020a). There is no settled\nconsensus on this issue, but the fact that intuition is\n\u201cblind\u201d does not seem to entail the strong position that\nintuition fails to provide any awareness of a\nmind-independent object.\n\nAllais (2009: 393\u20134; 2015: ch. 7) has argued against both the\nfirst and second points, pointing out that if we take Kant\u2019s\ndefinition of intuition (and likewise of concepts) seriously, then we\nmust be able to identify an independent contribution of sensibility to\ncognition\u2014viz. singular and immediate representation of an\nobject\u2014lest we fail to make sense of Kant\u2019s division\nbetween intuition and concept (cf. Kolb 1986; Falkenstein 1995: 63).\nRelatedly, others have remarked on the oddness of denying the\npossibility of articulating the distinct contribution made by\nsensibility given that Kant goes so far as to organize the structure\nof argument in the first Critique around the distinction\nbetween those contributions made by sensibility (the Transcendental\nAesthetic) and those made by the understanding (the Transcendental\nLogic, and in particular, the Analytic) (e.g., Bird 2006: 127; but cf.\nBauer 2012; Conant 2016). The claim of \u201cblindness,\u201d it is\nthus argued, should not be interpreted as so extreme as to render\nunintelligible fundamental aspects of Kant\u2019s architectonic, or\nof his repeated statements concerning the individual cognitive roles\nof the faculties of sensibility and understanding.\n\nOn an alternative and much weaker conception of the blindness problem,\nthe \u201cblindness\u201d of intuition might well only concern the\ndifficulties involved in articulating the nature of sensory content\nwithout drawing on concepts in the process of providing the\narticulation. As Bird (2006: 129\u2013130) notes however, this can be\nconceded without thereby admitting that there is no sensory content\n(or positive cognitive contribution) independent of conceptual\narticulation.\n",
