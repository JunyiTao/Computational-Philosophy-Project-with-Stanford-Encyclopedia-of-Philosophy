    "main_text": "The idea of zombies\n1. The idea of zombies\n\nDescartes held that non-human animals are automata: their behavior is\nwholly explicable in terms of physical mechanisms. But human behavior\n(he argued) could not be explained like that. Exploring the idea of a\nmachine that would look and behave like a human being, he thought two\nthings would unmask it: it could not use language creatively, and it\ncould not produce appropriate non-verbal behavior in arbitrarily\nvarious situations (Discourse V). For him, therefore, no\nmachine could behave like a human being. Knowing only seventeenth\ncentury technology, he concluded that to explain distinctively human\nbehavior required something beyond the physical: an immaterial mind,\ninteracting with processes in the brain and the rest of the body.\n(Importantly, he also had a priori arguments for the same\nconclusion, one of which anticipates the \u2018conceivability\nargument\u2019 discussed in Section 3 below.) If he is right, there\ncould not be a world physically like the actual world but lacking such\nminds: human bodies would not work properly. If we suddenly lost our\nminds our bodies might continue to run on for a while: our hearts\nmight continue to beat, we might breathe while asleep and digest food;\nwe might even walk or sing in a mindless sort of way (so he implies in\nhis Reply to Objections IV). But without the contribution\nmade by minds, behavior could not show characteristically human\nfeatures. So although Descartes did everything short of spelling out\nthe idea of zombies, the question of their possibility did not arise\nfor him. The nearest thing was automata whose behavior was easily\nrecognizable as not fully human.\n\nIn the nineteenth century scientists began to think that physics was\ncapable of explaining all physical events that were explicable at all.\nIt seemed that every physical effect has a physical cause: that the\nphysical world is \u2018closed under causation\u2019. The developing\nscience of neurophysiology was set to extend such explanations to\nhuman behavior. But if human behavior is explicable physically, how\ndoes consciousness fit into the story? One response \u2014\nphysicalism (or materialism) \u2014 is to insist that consciousness\ntoo involves only physical processes. However, the phenomena of\nconsciousness are hard to account for in those terms, and some\nthinkers concluded with Descartes that something nonphysical must be\ninvolved. Given they accepted the causal closure of the physical, they\nwere forced to conclude that consciousness has no effects on the\nphysical world. On this view human beings are \u2018conscious\nautomata\u2019, as T. H. Huxley put it: all physical events, human\nbehavior included, are explicable in terms of physical processes; and\nthe phenomena of consciousness are causally inert by-products \u2014\nepiphenomena (see James 1890, Chapter 5). It eventually became clear\nthat this view entailed there could be purely physical organisms\nexactly like us except for lacking consciousness. G. F. Stout argued\nthat if epiphenomenalism (the more familiar name for the\n\u2018conscious automaton\u2019 theory) is true,\n\nit ought to be quite credible that the constitution and course of\nnature would be otherwise just the same as it is if there were not and\nnever had been any experiencing individuals. Human bodies would still\nhave gone through the motions of making and using bridges, telephones\nand telegraphs, of writing and reading books, of speaking in\nParliament, of arguing about materialism, and so on. There can be no\ndoubt that this is prima facie incredible to Common Sense\n(Stout 1931: 138f.).\n\n\nWhat Stout describes here and finds prima facie incredible is\na zombie world: an entire world whose physical processes are closed\nunder causation (as the epiphenomenalists he was attacking held) and\nexactly duplicate those in the actual world, but where there are no\nconscious experiences.\n\nSimilar ideas were current in discussions of physicalism in the 1970s.\nAs a counterexample to the psychophysical identity theory there was an\n\u2018imitation man\u2019, whose \u2018brain-states exactly\nparalleled ours in their physico-chemical properties\u2019 but who\nfelt no pains and saw no colors (Campbell 1970). Zombies were put\nforward as a counterexample to physicalism in general, and arguments\ndevised to back up the intuition that they are possible (Kirk 1974a,\n1974b). However, these arguments fell short of their target because\nthey depended on much the same cluster of intuitions as the original\nidea.\n\nOther kinds of systems were envisaged which behaved like normal human\nbeings, or were even functionally like human beings, but lacked the\n\u2018qualia\u2019 we have (Block 1980a, 1980b, 1981; Shoemaker\n1975, 1981). (Roughly, qualia are the properties by which we classify\nexperiences according to \u2018what they are like\u2019: what it is\nlike to smell roasting coffee beans, for example. Even physicalists\ncan use this expression, although unlike dualists they take qualia to\nbe physical.) The most systematic use of the zombie idea against\nphysicalism is by David Chalmers 1996, whose important contributions\nto the debate will be considered shortly.\n\nIf zombies are to be counterexamples to physicalism, it is not enough\nfor them to be behaviorally and functionally like normal human beings:\nplenty of physicalists accept that merely behavioral or functional\nduplicates of ourselves might lack qualia. Zombies must be like normal\nhuman beings in all physical respects, and they must have the\nphysical properties that physicalists suppose we have. This requires\nthem to be subject to the causal closure of the physical, which is why\ntheir supposed lack of consciousness is a challenge to physicalism. If\ninstead they were to be conceived of as creatures whose behavior could\nnot be explained physically, physicalists would have no reason to\nbother with the idea: there is plenty of evidence that, as\nepiphenomenalists hold, our movements actually are explicable in\nphysical terms (see e.g. Papineau 2002).\n\nThe usual assumption is that none of us is actually a zombie, and that\nzombies cannot exist in our world. The central question, however, is\nnot whether zombies can exist in our world, but whether they, or a\nwhole zombie world (which is sometimes a more appropriate idea to work\nwith), are possible in some broader sense.\n",
