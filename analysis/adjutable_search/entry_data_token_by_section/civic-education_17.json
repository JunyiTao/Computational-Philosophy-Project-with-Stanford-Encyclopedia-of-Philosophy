    "main_text": "Modern Forms of Civic Education || Civic Education through Discussion\n4.3 Civic Education through Discussion\n\nEspecially if one\u2019s theory of democracy is deliberative (see\n section 2.3, above),\n the core of civic education may be learning to talk and listen with\nother people about public problems. That is a cognitively and\nethically demanding activity that can be learned from experience. The\nmost promising pedagogy is to discuss current events with a\nmoderator--usually the teacher--and some requirement to prepare in\nadvance. \n\nDebates are competitive discussions. Simulations (such as mock trials\nor the Model UN) involve discussing issues from the perspective of\nfictional or historical characters. And deliberations usually involve\nstudents speaking in their own real voice and trying to find common\nground. \n\nConsiderable evidence shows that moderated discussions of current,\ncontroversial issues increase students\u2019 knowledge of civic\nprocesses, their skills at engaging with other people, and their\ninterest in politics. See, e.g., Kawashima-Ginsberg and Levine\n(2014). \n\nHess (2009) and Hess & McAvoy (2014) argue for discussing current\ncontroversies and explore some of the ethical dilemmas that arise for\nteachers who do so. For instance, should a teacher disclose her or his\nown views or attempt to conceal them to be a neutral moderator? What\nquestions should be presented as genuinely controversial? (Most people\nwould insist that slavery is no longer a controversy and should not be\ntreated as such. But what about the reality of climate change?)\n",
