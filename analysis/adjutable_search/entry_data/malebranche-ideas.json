    "main_text": "\n1. The Nature and Scope of the Doctrine\n\nThe doctrine of Vision in God is easily misunderstood. It is not the\nview that we see God\u2019s essence \u2013 that vision in\nGod is vision of God \u2013 though Malebranche\u2019s chief\ncritic, the Cartesian Antoine Arnauld, charged that it was. It is also\nnot the view that corporeal objects, such as olive trees and Old\nEnglish sheepdogs, reside in God, or that God himself is corporeal.\nThe former would make Malebranche an idealist or an immaterialist, the\nlatter a Spinozist, but he rejects all such epithets.\n\nTo appreciate Malebranche\u2019s epistemological theory, one must\nremember that he was an orthodox Cartesian dualist and an orthodox\nChristian. Like Descartes, he maintained that there are two kinds of\ncreated substance \u2013 minds and bodies \u2013 and that the\nessence of bodies is extension (or spatial dimension). God, in turn,\nis an infinite, all-perfect, spiritual being. On this traditional\nChristian conception, it would be heresy to identify God with his\ncreatures, to suppose that God was extended, or to pretend to fathom\nGod\u2019s essence. Concerning the latter, Malebranche stressed that\nwe don\u2019t see God as he is in himself, for God\u2019s essence is\nperfectly simple, and by his grace we see only the diversity of\nparticular beings. God\u2019s simplicity also entails that he is not\nextended:\n\n\nGod\u2019s essence is his own absolute being, and minds do not see\nthe divine substance taken absolutely but only as relative to\ncreatures and to the degree that they can participate in it. What they\nsee in God is very imperfect, whereas God is most perfect. They see\nmatter that is shaped, divisible, and so on, but there is nothing\ndivisible or shaped in God, for God is all being, since he is infinite\nand comprehends everything; but he is no being in particular. Yet what\nwe see is but one or more particular beings, and we do not understand\nthis perfect simplicity of God, which includes all beings.\n(Search 3.2.6, OC 1:439; LO 231)\n\n\nHere Malebranche underscores another feature of God: the divine\nsubstance is not any particular being but \u2018all being\u2019 or\nwhat he elsewhere calls \u2018being in general.\u2019 We can see\nmaterial beings in God precisely because he is indeterminate; in\nseeing creatures we are seeing how they determinately\n\u2018participate in\u2019 or \u2018imitate\u2019 his\nperfections.\n\nIn conceiving God as \u2018being in general\u2019 Malebranche\nborrows much from the thirteenth-century scholastic thinker St. Thomas\nAquinas. Aquinas also conceives God as simple and indeterminate, and\nthinks it follows from this that we, with our finite minds, cannot\nfathom God\u2019s essence, and so must know him through his effects.\nMalebranche qualifies this last point somewhat by saying that we know\nGod through his possible (material) effects, that is,\nrelative to what he can produce. Indeed, Malebranche holds\nthat in God we see an infinity of possible worlds:\n\n\nWhen you contemplate \u2026 extension, you still see only the\narchetype both of the material world in which we live, and of an\ninfinity of other possible worlds. You are then actually seeing the\ndivine substance, for that alone is visible or capable of enlightening\nthe mind. But you do not see it in itself or as it really is. You see\nit only in its relation to material creatures, only as it is\nparticipable by or representative of them. Consequently, it is not\nstrictly speaking God whom you see, but only the matter he can produce.\n(Dialogue 2, OC 12:51; JS 21)\n\n\nAs we have seen, there are no particular beings in God, for God is\nsimple and general. But still Malebranche will insist that we\nsee material objects in God. How is this possible? The answer\nto this question involves another aspect of his doctrine not yet\nbroached \u2013 the theory of ideas. Malebranche defends a\nrepresentational theory of ideas, which holds that we don\u2019t see\nmaterial objects directly but only via the ideas that represent them.\nOn his version of this theory, material objects are unintelligible in\nthemselves and can be known only via something spiritual and\nimmediately present to the mind. Malebranche was not alone in the\nseventeenth-century in endorsing representationalism; in fact, it is\noften thought that he inherited this position from Descartes. Where\nthey clearly differ is in the ontological status they accord to ideas.\nDescartes develops a \u2018Christianized\u2019 version of the\nPlatonic theory of innate ideas, according to which ideas are created\nwith us at birth and constitute the very structure of our mind.\nMalebranche, in contrast, vehemently denies that ideas are created or\nthat they are modifications of finite minds, and instead regards them\nas eternal, necessary, and immutable realities that reside in God. To\nsay, then, that we perceive material things in God means that we\nimmediately perceive ideas in God, and via these ideas, we\nindirectly perceive corporeal objects. Ideas in God are the\n\u2018archetypes\u2019 or models that he uses to create things.\nThus, we can be assured that our knowledge of material things is of\nthe highest order.\n\nAs already noted, Malebranche restricts the doctrine of Vision in God\nto our sensory perception of material objects and their properties and\nto the abstract thought of mathematical essences. It does not\nencompass knowledge of God\u2019s essence, for as we have seen he\nthinks we know God only indirectly, by way of the material things that\nhe can create. But what about our knowledge of other things,\nespecially the self or the mind, or other minds? Why is that sort of\nknowledge excluded from the doctrine, especially since as a faithful\nCartesian dualist he maintains that there are both bodies and\nminds?\n\nGiven his theory of divine archetypes for creation, Malebranche must\nallow that there is an idea of the mind in God, but he does not think\nGod gives us access to this idea. We lack, therefore, what Descartes\nwould call a clear and distinct idea of the mind. And since ideas for\nMalebranche are the essences or natures of things, he denies that we\nhave knowledge of the mind\u2019s essence. To be sure, he endorses\nDescartes\u2019 cogito, or the claim that one knows\none\u2019s own existence. But here Malebranche distinguishes two\nkinds of knowledge (conno\u00eetre) \u2013 knowledge through\nideas as afforded by Vision in God and knowledge through consciousness\n\u2013 the latter being inferior. I have knowledge through\nconsciousness of the existence of my mind and its modifications, which\nis just to say that I know them by an inner awareness (sentiment\nint\u00e9rieur) that attends all of my thoughts, beliefs,\nsensations, passions, etc. But this awareness is limited to their bare\nexistence and fails to reveal their underlying nature. Indeed,\nalthough sensations and other such modifications of the mind are\ntypically strong and lively in their affects, they are \u2018confused\nmodalities \u2026 full of darkness\u2019 (Dialogue 3, OC 12:65; JS\n33). Malebranche\u2019s negative view of knowledge of the mind is the\nnatural complement to his theory of Vision in God. Following\nAugustine, Malebranche often stresses that the human mind is not a\nlight unto itself, and that God (or what he sometimes calls\n\u2018universal Reason\u2019) is the only true light, that is, the\nonly source of truth and knowledge: \u2018Man is not a light unto\nhimself. His substance, far from enlightening him, is itself\nunintelligible to him. He knows nothing except by the light of\nuniversal Reason which enlightens all minds, by the intelligible ideas\nwhich it discloses to them in its entirely luminous substance\u2019\n(Dialogue 3, OC 12:64; JS 32). The human mind is so utterly devoid of\ncognitive resources, and thus so completely dependent on God, that it\ncannot even know its own nature (for Malebranche on self-knowledge,\nsee Jolley 2000, Nolan and Whipple 2005, and Schmaltz 1996).\n\nMalebranche thinks that knowledge of other minds is even more\nimpoverished (if this seems possible), for here we must rely on\nconjecture. Other minds are not immediately present to us in the way\nthat our own mind and its modifications are, and so they cannot even\nbe known by consciousness. Instead, we must conjecture, on the basis\nof our sensory perception of the behavior of bodies similar to our\nown, that they are united to minds and that these minds are affected\nwith the same sorts of sensations and passions as ours. Such\nknowledge, however, is \u2018very liable to error\u2019\n(Search 3.2.7, OC 1:455; LO 239). One might wonder why\nMalebranche calls this \u2018knowledge\u2019 (la\nconnoissance) at all, and not \u2018opinion\u2019 or\n\u2018belief,\u2019 in keeping with the philosophical tradition. The\nsimple answer is that he is using the term broadly here to refer to\ndifferent forms of cognition \u2013 i.e., ways of perceiving\n(mani\u00e8res de voir) God, bodies, the self, and other\nminds.\n2. The Distinction between Ideas and Sensations\n\nIn the last section, we learned that there are no particular things in\nGod, but what about particular ideas? Malebranche sometimes\nwrites as if there are, and one commentator has argued that he was\ncommitted to such a view in the first edition of the Search\n(Gueroult 1955\u20139, vol. 1, 63f). This has since been disputed\n(see Schmaltz 2000, 72 and note 39), but whatever the case,\nMalebranche tends in later editions of the Search and in his\nlater writings generally to treat ideas as general and abstract. This\nis true both of the various geometrical ideas that we see in God and\nof the idea of extension: \u2018when I said that we see different\nbodies through the knowledge we have of God\u2019s perfections that\nrepresent them, I did not exactly mean that there are in God certain\nparticular ideas that represent each body individually \u2026\u2019\n(Elucidation 10, OC:154; LO 627). Beginning with the\nElucidations, Malebranche employs the term\n\u2018intelligible extension\u2019 to denote the general idea of\nextension, and to distinguish it from actual extension, which again is\nunintelligible in itself. In addition to being general, ideas\nin God are also \u2018pure\u2019 in the Cartesian sense that they\nare non-sensuous. Intelligible extension, then, is just the idea of\ngeometrical extension and its properties, or what in the\nseventeenth-century came to be known as the \u2018primary\nqualities.\u2019 Malebranche reduces these to two \u2013 figure\n(i.e., size and shape) and motion.\n\nThese two characteristic features of ideas raise the following\nquestions:\n\n\nIf intelligible extension is pure, then how can it represent\nsensible objects? Following Descartes, Malebranche wanted to\nhighlight the intellectual character of sense perception, but has he\ndone so at the expense of its sensory component?\n\nSupposing that intelligible extension does represent sensible objects\nhow, as a general idea, can it represent particular\nobjects?\n\n\nTo answer these questions we must first uncover an important\ndistinction that Malebranche draws between ideas on the one hand and\nsensations on the other. As we have already discovered, ideas are in\nGod and are cosubstantial with his substance. Sensations of colors,\nsounds, odors, heat, pleasure, etc., on the other hand, are\nmodifications of finite minds. Another important difference is that\nideas are intrinsically representational, whereas sensations are not.\nThe idea of a pyramid, for example, represents an actual pyramid in\nthe sense that it resembles it, but the sensation of pain that one\nexperience\u2019s when, say, accidentally lacerating one\u2019s arm,\nin no way resembles the wounded tissue. Ideas and sensations, then,\nare very different kinds of entity, but Malebranche maintains that\nsense perception combines elements of each.\n\n\nWhen we perceive something sensible, two things are found in our\nperception: sensation and pure idea. The sensation\nis a modification of our soul, and it is God who causes it in us. As\nfor the idea found in conjunction with the sensation, it is in God,\nand we see it because it pleases God to reveal it to us.\n(Search 3.2.6, OC 1:445; LO 234)\n\n\nThe composite character of sense perception provides answers to both\nof our questions. Malebranche explains:\n\n\nintelligible extension becomes visible and represents a certain body\nin particular only by means of color, because it is only by the\nvariety of colors that we judge the difference between the objects we\nsee\u2026. [A]s the sensations of color are essentially different,\nby means of them we judge the variety of bodies. If I distinguish your\nhand from your coat and both from the air surrounding them, this is\nbecause the sensations of light or color that I have of them are very\ndifferent (Dialogue 1, OC 12:46\u20137; JS 17).\n\nwe see or sense a given body when its ideas, i.e., when some figure\ncomposed of intelligible and general extension, becomes sensible and\nparticular through color or some other sensible perception by which\nits idea affects the soul and that the soul ascribes to it, for the\nsoul almost always projects its sensations on an idea that strikes it\nin lively fashion. (Elucidation 10, OC 3:152; LO 626)\n\n\nIn sense perception the mind \u2018projects\u2019 its sensations\nonto intelligible extension, or some determinate part of it, thereby\nrendering sensible what is otherwise abstract and general. It was a\ncommon view in the seventeenth century that sensations of color and\nlight, in particular, also serve another function in sense perception:\nthey enable us to discriminate shapes and, correlatively, individual\nbodies. As illusionists of the age were well aware, one can make a\nwoman appear headless if her head is covered with something that\nblends into the background (such as a black hood against a black\ncurtain) and she is dressed in clothing that is color-contrasting. In\nthese passages, Malebranche applies this general point to explain how\nthe sensations of color and light individuate intelligible extension\nand thereby yield sensory perceptions of particular objects.\nSensations both \u2018sensualize\u2019 and\n\u2018particularize\u2019 intelligible extension, and thus make it\npossible for us to see particular sensible objects in it.\n\nIn characterizing the relation between ideas and sensations here,\nMalebranche relies partially on metaphors. He speaks of\n\u2018projecting\u2019 our sensations onto ideas and elsewhere he\ncompares intelligible extension to a canvas onto which sensations are\n\u2018painted\u2019 (OC 6:78). Some commentators have attempted to\nunpack these metaphors and to offer a more specific account of the\nrelation between ideas and sensations in sense perception. They\nattribute an \u2018adverbial theory\u2019 of sensation to\nMalebranche. Since sensations are nonrepresentational, they do not\nconstitute an extra object of perception over and above the general\nidea of extension and the material objects they represent. In other\nwords, we do not perceive sensations; we directly perceive ideas and\nvia these ideas we indirectly perceive corporeal objects. Given this\naccount of the intentionality of perception, sensations are best\nunderstood adverbially, that is, as a way of perceiving\nobjects in the world. For example, when observing the setting sun, it\nwould be most accurate to say not that one senses \u2018red,\u2019\nbut that one senses redly (see Jolley 2000, 37f; Nadler 1992, 64; Pyle\n2003, 57, 63\u20135 and Radner 1978, 89). However, more recent\ndiscussions have cast serious doubts on whether Malebranche could be\ncommitted to an adverbial theory of sense perception, for a variety of\ndifferent reasons (see Nolan 2012, Ott 2014, and Simmons 2009).\n\nIn addition to the roles already discussed, sensations play one other\nimportant function in Malebranche\u2019s epistemology. They provide a\nkind of \u2018natural revelation\u2019 of the existence of bodies.\nIt is important to remember here that the idea of extension in God\ndoes not reveal anything about the existence of bodies, only their\nessence. Speaking once again of the composite character of sense\nperception, he writes: \u2018There is always a clear idea and a\nconfused sensation in the view we have of sensible objects. The idea\nrepresents their essence, and the sensation informs us of their\nexistence\u2019 (Dialogue 5, OC 12:113; JS 74). More strongly,\nsensations \u2018make us judge\u2019 that there is an object in the\nworld corresponding to our perception (Elucidation 10, OC 3:143; LO\n621). \u2018God joins the sensation to the idea when objects are\npresent so that we may believe them to be present\u2026.\u2019\n(Search, 6.2.6, OC 3:152; LO 234).\n\nAlthough sensations provide a \u2018strong propensity\u2019 to\nbelieve in the existence of bodies, they do not provide conclusive\nproof or even evidence of their existence, for the senses often\ndeceive us (Elucidation 6, OC 3:55f; LO 569f). Malebranche notes, for\nexample, that \u2018our eyes represent colors to us on the surface of\nbodies and \u2026 our ears make us hear sounds as if spread out\nthrough the air and in the resounding bodies; and if we believe what\nthe senses report, heat will be in fire, sweetness will be in sugar,\nmusk will have an odor\u2026.\u2019 (ibid., OC 3:55\u20136; LO\n569). Like many of the mechanical philosophers in the seventeenth\ncentury, Malebranche holds that so-called sensible qualities (colors,\nsounds, odors, heat and cold, etc.) are not in bodies \u2013 which\nagain are to be conceived in terms of geometrical extension alone\n\u2013 but are modifications of the mind. However, his point in the\npassage cited is that the senses deceptively entice us to attribute\nthem to bodies. If they deceive us in this way, then it is at least\npossible that they also deceive us about the existence of bodies.\n\nIf the senses do not provide absolute certainty about the existence of\nbodies, one might wonder why God uses them at all for this purpose,\nespecially since Malebranche also contends \u2018faith obliges us to\nbelieve that there are bodies\u2019 (ibid., OC 3:62; LO 573). Why\nthen don\u2019t the revelations of Scripture suffice? Why do we need\nthe \u2018natural revelations\u2019 of sense? The answer is that\nlike most Cartesians, Malebranche holds that the main purpose of the\nsenses is to aid and preserve one\u2019s mind-body union. If a lion\nis chasing me or if I am in danger of being consumed by a raging fire,\nI do not need to be absolutely certain that the lion or the fire\nexists in order to know that it is in my best interests to flee. So\nwhereas faith obliges me to believe in the existence of bodies\ngenerally, sensations inform me of the existence of those particular\nbodies, such as my own body and those in its vicinity, which may\naffect it positively or negatively.\n3. Descartes, Augustine, and the Argument from Properties\n\nMalebranche\u2019s philosophy generally owes much to the thought of\nDescartes and Augustine. This is particularly true in the case of\nVision in God, which bears a striking resemblance to Augustine\u2019s\ntheory of divine illumination, but which is also informed by Cartesian\nviews about the role of ideas in cognition and the intellectual\ncharacter of sensory perception. One way of gaining insight into the\ndoctrine of Vision in God then is by regarding it as a synthesis of\nDescartes and Augustine\u2019s philosophies of cognition. By\nintegrating their views, and using each as a corrective to the other,\nMalebranche produces a new doctrine that attempts to preserve and\nextend their philosophical insights while avoiding their limitations\nand problems.\n\nLet us pursue this inroad into Malebranche\u2019s theory of\ncognition, beginning with his Cartesian inheritance. Descartes is\noften read as holding a representative theory of perception, according\nto which our perception of material objects is mediated by ideas.\nIdeas are the immediate objects of perception and, via these ideas, we\nare able to perceive bodies in the world. He encourages such a reading\nin the Third Meditation, where he famously says that all ideas are\n\u2018as it were the images of things\u2019 (CSM 2:25, AT 7:37).\nDescartes explicitly denies that ideas are mental images;\nhowever, he suggests here that they are like images in the\nsense that they represent objects in the world.\n\nWhy would someone hold such a view, especially as it seems to violate\ncommonsense? In cases where I am looking directly at an object that is\nbefore me, such as a tree, I am inclined to think that what I perceive\ndirectly is the tree itself, not some ideational proxy for the tree.\nProponents of the representative theory, however, are often motivated\nby cases of non-veridical perception. In endorsing this theory\nhimself, Malebranche is no exception. When I hallucinate a pink\nelephant nothing in the world corresponds to my perception;\nnevertheless, my perception has an intentional character, i.e., it is\n\u2018of\u2019 or \u2018about\u2019 some object. Indeed,\nMalebranche maintains that all thought takes an object, on the grounds\nthat \u2018To see nothing is not to see; to think of nothing is not\nto think\u2019 (OCM 2:99, LO:320). Call this \u2018the principle of\nintentionality.\u2019 If, in hallucinating the pink elephant, there\nwere not some object of my hallucination I would not be having a\nperception at all. Ideas are introduced as a way of explaining how my\nperception can be intentional even in such cases. Absent a material\nthing, there must be some immaterial surrogate \u2013 call it an\n\u2018idea\u2019 \u2013 toward which my perception is immediately\ndirected.\n\nHaving established this result in the case of hallucinations, dreams,\nsensory illusions, etc., the representationalist must find a ground\nfor extending this conclusion to veridical perception. For in\nveridical perception the principle of intentionality could be\npreserved without appealing to ideas. One could say that the immediate\nobject of my perception is some material thing in the world.\nMalebranche eliminates this possibility by appealing to the principle\nthat all the immediate objects of perception must be of the same\nontological kind. One set of perceptions cannot have ideas as their\nobjects, while another set of perceptions is directed toward material\nthings. If non-veridical perceptions derive their intentional\ncharacter from being directed toward ideas, then so must all\nperceptions; otherwise this principle would be violated (see Nadler\n1992, 83).\n\nThe Argument from Properties: Establishing the representative\ntheory of perception is just one part of Malebranche\u2019s task in\ndefending the doctrine of Vision in God. Having argued that ideas are\nthe immediate objects of perception and thought, he must now deal with\na further question: \u2018where\u2019 are ideas? What is their\nlocus? Malebranche\u2019s answer of course is that ideas reside in\nGod, but in affirming this claim he is making his first important\nbreak with Descartes. It is fair to say that this is one place where\nMalebranche sees himself as correcting Descartes and using Augustine\nto do so. Descartes had taught that ideas are modifications of human\nminds. Indeed, Descartes would say that the ideas that figure most\nprominently in Malebranche\u2019s doctrine \u2013 viz. the\nidea of extension and the ideas of various mathematical objects\n\u2013 are innate, part of the very structure of the mind bestowed\nupon us by God. This means that Cartesian ideas are 1) finite mental\nitems and 2) created. Malebranche rejects both of these claims but,\nironically, he does so on grounds that appear to be at least partially\ninspired by Descartes\u2019 own writings.\n\nIn the Third Meditation, Descartes stresses that insofar as they\nrepresent things to us, ideas are real beings, even if the objects\nthey represent do not exist outside thought. The\n\u2018representational reality\u2019 of ideas falls short of the\nactual being of things in the world but, nevertheless, it is not\nnothing (AT 7:41, CSM 2:29). He reaffirms this point in the Fifth\nMeditation and adds that the ideas of various geometrical figures have\n\u2018immutable and eternal\u2019 essences, as is clear from the\nfact that these ideas resist efforts by our mind to deform them. For\nexample, once I have recognized that having angles equal to two right\nangles is part of the content of the idea of triangle, I am compelled\nto recognize this property \u2018whether I want to or not\u2019 (AT\n7:64, CSM 2:45). In general, Descartes holds that so-called\n\u2018clear and distinct ideas\u2019 are such that I cannot add\nanything to them or subtract anything from them (AT 7:51, 117\u20138;\nCSM 2:35, 83\u20134). Although he does not mention Descartes as his\nsource, Malebranche develops these points in a way that leads to some\nvery anti-Cartesian conclusions. He too wishes to stress that ideas\nare real beings and that they resist our mind\u2019s efforts to alter\nthem:\n\n\nI am thinking of a number, of a circle, of a room, of your chairs, in\na word, of particular beings. I am also thinking of being or of the\ninfinite, of undetermined being. All these ideas have some reality\nwhile I think of them. You do not doubt this, because nothingness has\nno properties and they do. (Dialogue 1, OC 12:37; JS:10)\n\nYou believe this floor exists because you feel it resist\nyou\u2026. But do you think your ideas do not resist you? Find me\nthen two unequal diameters in a circle, or three equal ones in an\nellipse. Find me the square root of eight and the cube root of\nnine\u2026. [M]ake two feet of intelligible extension equal no more\nthan one. Certainly the nature of this extension cannot countenance\nthat. It resists your mind. Do not, therefore, doubt its reality.\n(ibid., OC 12:41\u20132; JS:13\u201314)\n\n\nSo far, Malebranche has not said anything with which Descartes would\ndisagree: the fact that ideas have properties and resist our thought\ndemonstrates their reality. But Descartes also speaks of ideas as\n\u2018immutable and eternal.\u2019 Malebranche concurs with this as\nwell, and adds that they are \u2018necessary,\u2019\n\u2018universal,\u2019 and \u2018infinite\u2019. The idea of\nextension, for example, is \u2018necessary, eternal, immutable, and\ncommon to all minds\u2026.\u2019 (ibid., OC 12:42; JS:14) To say\nthat ideas are \u2018necessary\u2019 just means that \u2018it is\nimpossible that they should not be as they are,\u2019 and this is\nsomething that Malebranche thinks is discoverable in thought\n(Elucidation 10, OC 3:130; LO 614). Ideas are infinite in the sense\nthat they are \u2018inexhaustible.\u2019 One can discover in the\nidea of extension, for example, \u2018infinite numbers of\nintelligible triangles, tetragons, pentagons, and other such\nfigures,\u2019 as well as an infinite number of truths that can be\ndemonstrated of them (ibid.). The ideas of extension and the various\ngeometrical figures are also immutable (or unchanging) and eternal in\nthe sense that they did not come into being, and will not go out of\nbeing. And although cultural norms and tastes may vary among cultures,\nraces, and periods, the truths of mathematics are universal and common\nto all intelligences in the sense that all minds will, upon\nreflection, discover the same ones. Such truths are not the product of\nconvention but are intellectual givens that impose themselves on our\nthought.\n\nFrom the claim that ideas are necessary, eternal, immutable, etc.,\nMalebranche draws his first and most important anti-Cartesian\nconclusion, namely, that ideas must reside in God and be\n\u2018coeternal and consubstantial with Him\u2019 (Elucidation 10,\nOC 3:131; LO 614). Indeed, since Descartes affirms some or all of\nthese properties himself, consistency would seem to require that he\nabandon his view that ideas are created modes of finite minds. If\nideas are necessary and eternal then they cannot be created, as\ncreated things are contingent and have a beginning. Ideas also cannot\nbe modes of the soul, for \u2018it is clear that the soul\u2019s\nmodes are changeable but ideas are immutable; that its modes are\nparticular, but ideas are universal and general to all intelligences;\nthat its modes are contingent, but ideas are eternal and\nnecessary\u2026.\u2019 (Search, OC 2:103; LO 322\u20133).\nMalebranche expresses his positive conclusion at times by referring to\nGod once again as \u2018universal Reason\u2019 or the intelligible\nrealm of ideas:\n\nBut if it is true that the Reason in which all men participate is\nuniversal, that it is infinite, that it is necessary and immutable,\nthen it is certainly not different from God\u2019s own reason, for\nonly the infinite and universal being contains in itself an infinite\nand universal reason. All creatures are particular beings; universal\nreason, therefore, is not created. No creature is infinite; infinite\nreason, therefore, is not a creature. (Elucidation 10, OC 3:131;\nLO:614)\n\n\nAlthough he appears to draw these results from tensions within\nDescartes\u2019 theory of ideas, Malebranche finds additional support\nand inspiration for the doctrine of Vision in God in Augustine\u2019s\ntheory of divine illumination. Indeed, it is often said that Vision in\nGod combines Descartes\u2019 representationalism with an Augustinian\nor Neoplatonic ontology of ideas. The exact degree to which Augustine\ndirectly influenced Malebranche here, however, is difficult to gauge\nand one commentator has argued that the influence was minimal at most\n(See Connell 1967). That having been said, Malebranche often writes as\nif the lineage was direct and tends to minimize his philosophical\ndifferences with Augustine over the nature of cognition:\n\nIt therefore must be, as St. Augustine says in 500 hundred places,\nthat ideas are eternal, immutable, necessary, common to all souls, so\nthat there are most certainly truth and falsehood, justice and\ninjustice, eternal truths and laws; and that our souls are enlightened\nby the same ideas in consequence of the union that they have with this\nuniversal Reason which contains them all in its substance, which alone\nis the life and light of all intelligences\u2026. (OC 9:933)\n\n\nDespite what he regards as general agreement, Malebranche\ndifferentiates his view from Augustine\u2019s in two ways. First,\nwhereas Augustine spoke of seeing \u2018truths\u2019 in God,\nMalebranche speaks primarily of (immediately) seeing\n\u2018ideas.\u2019 This minor difference stems from\nMalebranche\u2019s tendency to privilege ideas and to understand\ntruth in terms of them. Truth is but a relation among ideas, though on\nhis scheme relations need not be anything real, over and above ideas,\nfor in perceiving any two ideas we can also grasp the relations\nbetween them.\n\nWe are of the opinion, then, that truths (\u2026 such as that twice\ntwo is four) are not absolute beings, much less that they are God\nHimself. For clearly, this truth consists only in the relation of\nequality between twice two and four. Thus, we do not claim, as does\nSaint Augustine, that we see God in seeing truths, but in seeing the\nideas of these truths \u2013 for ideas are real, whereas the\nequality between the ideas, which is the truth, is nothing\nreal \u2026. Thus, our view is that we see God when we see eternal\ntruths, and not that these truths are God, because the ideas on which\nthese truths depend are in God \u2013 it might even be that this was\nSaint Augustine\u2019s meaning. (Search 3.2.6, OC 1:444; LO\n234)\n\n\nMalebranche speaks rather baldly here. He seems to deny truths any\nreality whatsoever, but what he really wants is something weaker.\nElsewhere he draws a distinction between real relations like truth and\nimaginary relations such as falsehood. He denies reality only to the\nlatter, and wants to reduce real relations to ideas (Search\n6.1.5, OC 2:286; LO 433). Thus, the difference between Augustine and\nMalebranche on whether we directly perceive truths or ideas in God may\nbe only nominal, for Malebranche is not denying the reality of truths\nbut merely reducing them to ideas.\n\nSecond, and more significantly, Malebranche self-consciously extends\nAugustine\u2019s theory of divine illumination to material things.\nWhere Augustine limited his account to the intellectual apprehension\nof truths that are eternal and necessary, Malebranche conceives Vision\nin God as an all-encompassing theory of cognition that includes the\nsensory perception of sensible objects in the world. Malebranche\nbelieves that Augustine was prevented from seeing how the theory of\nillumination could be extended in this way as a result of two\nphilosophical prejudices. First, he maintained that we see bodies\ndirectly, without the aid of ideas. Second, like most philosophers\nprior to the scientific revolution he thought that colors, sounds,\npains, heat, and other sensory qualities are in bodies. But of course\nthese qualities change. If these two prejudices are combined, as\nMalebranche believed they were in Augustine\u2019s thinking, then to\nsay that we see material things in God would mean that God contains\nobjects that are changeable and corruptible. But this violates\nGod\u2019s immutability. Malebranche, however, thinks he has the\nresources for avoiding this result:\n\nWe further believe that changeable and corruptible things are known in\nGod, though Saint Augustine speaks only of immutable and incorruptible\nthings, because for this to be so, no imperfection need be placed in\nGod, since, as we have already said, it is enough that God should\nreveal to us what in Him is related to these things. (Search\n3.2.6, OC 1:444\u20135; LO 234)\n\n\nMalebranche is able to extend the scope of Augustine\u2019s theory of\nillumination as a result of what were then two recent philosophical\ndevelopments, courtesy of Descartes. First, the representational\ntheory of ideas allowed Malebranche to say that what we see directly\nin God are not changeable objects but ideas or essences. In the case\nof material things we see intelligible extension, which is immutable\nand incorruptible, in keeping with the divine nature. Second,\nMalebranche took from Descartes the view that colors and the other\nso-called \u2018secondary qualities\u2019 are not qualities of\nbodies but sensations or modifications of the mind (whether Descartes\nactually held this position himself is controversial). Since bodies do\nnot have these qualities, the idea of extension need not represent\nthem, and once again God is spared from having to accommodate\nchangeable entities. It is interesting to note here that by reducing\nsecondary qualities to sensations, Malebranche can also explain the\nvariations we see in the primary qualities of extension. Even if\nbodies are not colored, they still change their size, shape, motion,\nand position. How can intelligible extension represent those\nvariations without violating God\u2019s immutability? The answer is\nthat it need not, for as we have already discussed, color and light\nsensations \u2018particularize\u2019 extension and enable the mind\nto discriminate shapes and, correlatively, all the other primary\nqualities \u2013 sizes, positions, motions, etc. Sensations, then,\nare responsible for all the variations we see in material objects.\n4. Other Arguments for Vision in God\n\nIn the previous section, we examined Malebranche\u2019s most mature\nargument for locating ideas in God in the Argument from Properties.\nThis argument, which first appeared in Elucidations of The Search\nAfter Truth, highlights the Neoplatonic and Augustinian character\nof Malebranchean ideas and reveals his efforts to correct Descartes.\nWhen coupled with the Cartesian view that all perception is\nrepresentational, it provides one of Malebranche\u2019s strongest\nsupports for Vision in God.\n\nWhen first introducing the doctrine of Vision in God in the\nSearch, however, he takes a different tack. There he presents\na negative, or eliminative, argument in which he enumerates five\ncompeting theories of how material objects are known, and then\nsystematically eliminates each one until only Vision in God remains.\nFor such an argument to succeed, one must ensure that the enumeration\nis complete \u2013 that it exhausts all possible theories.\nMalebranche clearly thinks that he satisfies this requirement, though\ncritics from John Locke onwards have complained that it does not. Some\nrecent commentators have attempted to show why Malebranche\u2019s\nenumeration is, indeed, complete or at least why he thinks it is\n(Connell 1967, 162; Nadler 1992, 138\u2013140).\n\nBut rather than pursue that line of thought, we might note something\nelse about Malebranche\u2019s strategy: he does not rest content with\nthe standard structure of an eliminative argument. After raising\ndoubts about the four other theories, he marshals various positive\narguments in support of vision in God. One might think that\nMalebranche is simply making as strong a case as possible for his\npreferred theory or, since he has these other arguments ready to hand,\ndisplaying them for his readers\u2019 edification. But when his\npositive arguments are examined carefully, one finds that many of the\nsame reasons are used to cast doubt upon the rival theories. It would\nappear that as much as trying to convince the reader of Vision in God,\nthe Argument from Elimination lays the groundwork for that doctrine by\nprefiguring the positive reasons in favor of it or, to put it somewhat\ndifferently, by revealing what is required for us to have knowledge of\nmaterial objects. Malebranche holds that once one appreciates the\nrequirements or preconditions for knowledge, she will be forced to\nconclude that only Vision in God satisfies all of them. Thus, behind\nthe surface of Malebranche\u2019s eliminative argument lies a deeper,\nmore positive approach. Given this understanding of\nMalebranche\u2019s strategy, and in the interests of brevity, we\nshall focus here on the positive arguments that he adduces in favor of\nVision in God.\n\nMalebranche\u2019s arguments appeal primarily (but not exclusively)\nto facts about the divine nature and about the relation between God\n\u2013 the infinite substance \u2013 and his finite creation. This\nreflects the theological spirit of Malebranche\u2019s philosophy\ngenerally, but it is also a common strategy of the modern rationalists\n(most notably, Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche, and Leibniz) to derive\nconclusions about finite beings from considerations about infinite\nbeing. Malebranche identifies five main reasons in support of the\nclaim that \u2018we see all things in God.\u2019 Before developing\nthese reasons, however, he reminds the reader of two other\nconsiderations, introduced previously, that provide a prima facie case\nin favor of Vision in God. First, there must be ideas of all created\nbeings in God, for otherwise he would not have been able to create.\nThe view that \u2018blind creation\u2019 is impossible is part of\nMalebranche\u2019s Augustinian heritage, and relies on the intuition\nthat in order to create something one must have models or archetypes\nof what one is going to create. Ideas, then, serve as these\narchetypes, but they must be in God himself prior to creation for\notherwise there would something external to God constraining what he\ncould create, which would violate his omnipotence or supreme power.\nGod can have the ideas of all things within him because he contains an\ninfinite number of perfections and, as discussed in section 2, he sees\nall possible beings by considering how his perfections can be imitated\nin finite ways. There is a deeper intuition here as well, and that is\nthat if God is truly wise or omniscient then creation must be an\nintelligible and rational process whereby God acts in accordance with\ncertain standards. Malebranche rejects Descartes\u2019 doctrine that\nthe created universe is an arbitrary product of God\u2019s\nindifferent will. Ideas in God, then, constitute these eternal and\nimmutable standards.\n\nSecond, Malebranche holds that created minds enjoy an intimate union\nwith God even in this life, as a result of our complete and utter\ndependence on the creator. As a result of this union, God is always\n\u2018present\u2019 to our mind. Speaking metaphorically,\nMalebranche says that God is, in a sense, the \u2018place\u2019 of\nminds as space is the place of bodies. On the basis of these two\nconsiderations, Malebranche concludes that God could, if he saw fit,\ncause finite minds to see all things in him: \u2018the mind surely\ncan see what in God represents created beings, since what in God\nrepresents created beings is very spiritual, intelligible, and present\nto the mind. Thus, the mind can see God\u2019s works in Him, provided\nthat God wills to reveal to it what in Him represents them\u2019\n(Search 3.2.6, OC 1:437; LO 230). Since the ideas of all\nthings are already in God and our minds enjoy an intimate\nunion with him at all times, it is easy to see how God could make us\nsee all things in him. But, again, Malebranche does not intend these\nconsiderations to be decisive, only to show how Vision in God is\npossible and \u2018conforms to reason\u2019 (ibid., OC 1:438; LO\n230). The introduction of these considerations is primarily strategic,\nfor he then proceeds to develop and reinforce them in his five main\narguments, to which we now turn:\n\n\n\nThe Simplicity of the Divine Ways: Having already highlighted\nthe rational character of creation in the first consideration,\nMalebranche begins this argument with another such point that once\nagain underscores God\u2019s wisdom. God always creates in the\nsimplest of ways. This is a consequence not only of his simplicity,\nbut also of his wisdom and power.\n\nGod never does in very complicated fashion what can be done in a very\nsimple and straightforward way. For God never does anything uselessly\nand without reason. His power and wisdom are not shown by doing lesser\nthings with greater means \u2013 that is contrary to reason and\nindicates a limited intelligence. Rather, they are shown by doing\ngreater things with very simple and straightforward means (ibid.).\n\nHow is Vision in God simpler? And simpler than what? One of the\nalternative theories that he considers in the Argument from\nElimination is that God creates a complete set of innate ideas within\neach mind. But our mind is capable of thinking of an infinite number\nof figures, numbers, etc. Thus, if this alternative theory were true,\nit would mean God would have to create an infinite set of ideas for\nevery finite mind. But as God already contains within his\nunderstanding a complete set of ideas or archetypes for creation, it\nis far simpler for him to reveal them to us, to allow us to see all\nthings in him.\n\nOne should not underestimate the intended force of this argument.\nMalebranche is not conceding that God could have stocked\nevery mind with a complete set of innate ideas but just happened to\nact in accordance with his simplicity. One commentator has noted that\nin the first four editions of the Search, Malebranche begins\nthe argument by saying, \u2018although it is not absolutely denied\nthat God can make an infinity of infinite numbers of entities\nrepresentative of things with each mind he creates, nevertheless one\nought not to believe that he does\u2026.\u2019 Daisie Radner\nconcludes on the basis of this statement that the appeal to simplicity\nis \u2018not considered even by Malebranche to be one of the stronger\narguments for seeing all things in God,\u2019 for it does not rule\nout the alternative view, absolutely speaking (1978, 52). But this\nconclusion misunderstands the sentence above that Malebranche\nsubsequently excised in later editions. To get a grip on what he means\nwe must compare similar language, and a similar point about divine\nsimplicity, to which Malebranche appeals in his theodicy (i.e., his\nsolution to the problem of evil). He attempts to justify the existence\nof evil in the world by saying that although God wished to create the\nbest of all possible worlds absolutely speaking, he was constrained to\nact in such ways as honor his attributes or perfections \u2013\nespecially his simplicity: \u2018His ways must bear the character of\nHis attributes, as well as His work. It is not enough that His work\nhonor Him by its excellence; it is necessary in addition that His ways\nglorify Him by their Divinity\u2019 (Dialogue 9, OC 12:214; JS 163).\nFor Malebranche, God\u2019s works and his ways (or means of creating)\nmust honor him; he therefore strikes a balance between the\n\u2018beauty of the work\u2019 and the \u2018simplicity of his\nways\u2019 (Dialogue 9, OC 12:215; JS 164). This is not the best of\nall possible worlds that God could create, absolutely speaking, but it\nis the best relative to the simplicity of his ways (Jolley 2004). In\nmaking this point, Malebranche is not claiming that God could have\nmade a better world, for that would require violating his simplicity.\nOn the supposition that he is going to create anything, God must act\nso as to honor his perfections; otherwise he would not be an\nall-perfect being, which is impossible. The same point applies to\nMalebranche\u2019s epistemology; here too divine simplicity\nconstitutes a side constraint on God\u2019s actions, such that there\nis no genuine sense in which he could have created each mind with a\ncomplete set of ideas. Divine simplicity demands Vision in God.\n\n\n\nDependence: It is a mark of Christian philosophy generally to\nstress the dependence of created beings on God. This emphasis\nmanifests itself primarily in the traditional doctrine of divine\nconcurrence, according to which God not only creates but also\ncontinually conserves finite minds and bodies in their existence. But\nMalebranche thinks this doctrine has an air of mystery to it, and\nfails to capture the magnitude and character of our dependence:\n\u2018that general and confused term concourse, by means of\nwhich we would explain creatures\u2019 dependence on God, rouses not\na single distinct idea in an attentive mind\u2019 (OC 1:440, LO 231).\nA proper conception of God entails that we depend on God in every way\npossible, not just ontologically but cognitively as well. Vision in\nGod is the only theory that does justice to the latter, for on this\naccount God not only causes us to see material objects but he is the\none in whom we see them: \u2018He is truly the mind\u2019s light and\nthe father of lights\u2019 (ibid.).\n\nThe view that created beings depend completely on God informs\nMalebranche\u2019s entire philosophy. Indeed, Malebranche\nacknowledges this at the end of the chapter we are discussing, where\nhe returns to the theme of dependence and invokes the words of St.\nPaul which he sees his philosophy as vindicating: \u2018In God we\nlive, move, and have our being\u2019 (Acts 17:28). It is sometimes\nsaid that Vision in God is the \u2018epistemological correlate\u2019\nof Malebranche\u2019s Occasionalism, according to which God is the\nonly true cause (McCracken 1983, 66; Nadler 1992, 141; Pyle 2003, 56).\nWhere Occasionalism stresses our dependence on God\u2019s power,\nVision in God underscores our dependence on his wisdom. Without God,\nwe are both causally and cognitively impotent. \n\n\nInfinite Cognitive Capacity: In his first argument,\nMalebranche appealed to the fact that we are capable of thinking of an\ninfinite number of things, at least in principle, and this is obvious\nhe thinks from considerations of mathematical objects, which are\ninfinite in number. The question raised by the third argument \u2013\nwhich Malebranche declares to be his \u2018strongest\u2019 \u2013\nis how this infinite capacity is possible. He might have ended the\nargument here by concluding that we must see all things in God, for a\nfinite mind is incapable of containing an infinity of beings. Instead,\nhe attempts to strengthen his case by observing a further wrinkle in\nthe nature of cognition. Malebranche asserts that whenever we desire\nto think of some particular object we must first survey all beings and\nthen focus on the object we wish to think about. If we did not already\nhave at least a general and confused apprehension of the object we\nwished to consider, then we could not direct our attention to it.\nMalebranche takes this to be a datum of our experience, but the\nunderlying principle is of Platonic origin. Plato famously argues in\nthe Meno that all knowledge is recollection, for it is\nimpossible to inquire about that of which one is ignorant. One must be\nat least dimly aware of all things one seeks to know, and thus\nlearning is more like remembering than discovering something entirely\nnew (cf. McCracken 1983, 66). Augustine (On the Teacher10.33)\nhad already adapted this argument for his own ends, and here\nMalebranche is following suit.\n\nSo each of us is capable of thinking of an infinite number of things\nand, more importantly, in thinking of any particular thing one must\ngrasp this infinity. It is at this point that Malebranche concludes\n(for the reason given above) that this infinity of beings must be in\nGod, and that it is only through our union with God that these beings\nare present to us in thought. How does God contain this infinity? Not\nby literally being composed of an infinity of particular ideas, for\nagain God is perfectly simple. On Malebranche\u2019s conception, God\nis \u2018being in general,\u2019 \u2018infinite being,\u2019 or\n\u2018being without restriction\u2019 (3.2.8, OC 1:456; LO 241). In\nhim, \u2018all beings [are] contained in one\u2019 precisely because\nhe is infinite and indeterminate. This point allows him to further\nclarify the nature of cognition: \u2018not only does the mind have\nthe idea of the infinite, it even has it before that of the\nfinite\u2026. In order for us to conceive of a finite being,\nsomething must necessarily be eliminated from this general notion of\nbeing, which consequently must come first\u2019 (3.2.6, OC 1:441; LO\n232). Here Malebranche follows Descartes in affirming that the idea of\nthe infinite is conceptually prior to the idea of the finite, but then\nadds a twist that pushes him away from Descartes (and closer to\nSpinoza), namely that we conceive particular things by limiting or\nnegating the idea of the infinite. \n\n\nCausal Efficacy: In this argument, Malebranche begins by\nnoting that ideas are causally efficacious \u2018since they act upon\nthe mind and enlighten it\u2019 and \u2018make it happy or unhappy\nthrough pleasant or unpleasant perceptions by which they affect\nit\u2019 (3.2.6, OC 1:442; LO 232). To establish that these ideas are\nin God, he then invokes an Augustinian principle, namely that\n\u2018nothing can act immediately upon the mind unless it is superior\nto it.\u2019 To make sense of this principle, one must envisage, as\nAugustine did, a hierarchy of being in which minds are higher than\nbodies and God constitutes the upper limit of moral perfection. For\nMalebranche, these are the only substances there are. So it follows\nthat only God can act on the soul and, insofar as they are\nefficacious, ideas must be the very substance of God. \n\n\nThe Purpose of Creation: In his final argument, Malebranche\nappeals once again to creation, focusing this time on its purpose. He\nmaintains that as an absolutely perfect being, God can act only for\nhis own glory. There is nothing that he lacks for which created beings\nsomehow compensate. Thus, God created the universe so that his works\nwould reflect his perfections and, as much as possible, be directed\ntoward him. As conscious beings whose thoughts point beyond\nthemselves, minds are especially well suited to this purpose for only\nthey are capable of knowing his perfections. But don\u2019t we know\nother things besides God? Yes, Malebranche will answer, but given\nGod\u2019s aim in creation we can know his works only if we also see\nhim to some extent (3.2.6, OC 1:442\u20133; LO 233). Vision in God\nsatisfies this requirement, for it affirms that we see all things in\nGod by way of ideas that are identical with his substance. \n\n5. Efficacious Ideas\n\nMalebranche is a philosopher whose thought developed markedly over\ntime. In part this was due to his lively engagement with critics and\nhis attempts to respond to their objections, and also to his\nrecognition that his doctrines required further articulation than he\nhad provided in earlier writings. One of the most significant\ndevelopments to the theory of Vision in God was the view that ideas\nare causally efficacious. Malebranche had already argued that ideas\nhave properties \u2013 necessity, eternality, immutability,\nuniversality, etc. \u2013 but in response to an objection by his\nCartesian critic Pierre-Sylvain R\u00e9gis, he came to ascribe\ncausal powers to them as well. This new theory is introduced in the\ncontext of the claim that the mind is united to God, even in this\nlife. It is because of this union, Malebranche maintains, that Vision\nin God is possible. We are always in immediate contact with being in\ngeneral and so can focus our attention on the idea of intelligible\nextension at any time or immediately perceive it in sense\nperception.\n\nR\u00e9gis was rightly curious about the nature of this union with\nGod. Malebranche had spoken metaphorically of the\n\u2018presence\u2019 of God to the mind, but without ever specifying\nwhat he meant. R\u00e9gis noted that this union cannot be understood\non the model of the union of one body with another, for that requires\nactual physical contact; nor should it be thought to resemble the\nmind\u2019s union with the body, for that would make the mind and God\nmutually dependent on each other, and the infinite being depends on\nnothing. No, R\u00e9gis argued, the only viable way to understand\nthe God-mind union is on the model of cause to effect, respectively.\nAt this point he uncovers an important objection that he had been\nanticipating: if mind-God union is to be understood causally, then it\nis still possible that we perceive bodies by means of ideas that are\nin us, but caused by bodies themselves, as Descartes himself had\ntaught (SG 1:188; also see Schmaltz 2000, 76\u20137).\n\nIn his response, Malebranche attempts to exploit R\u00e9gis\u2019\nsuggestion but without leaving the door open to Cartesianism. Lacking\ncausal efficacy and being \u2018invisible\u2019 in themselves,\nbodies cannot act directly on the mind in the way that R\u00e9gis\nhad indicated. In virtue of being in God, however, the idea of\nextension can \u2018affect\u2019 or \u2018touch\u2019 the mind in\nvarious ways (OC 17\u20131, 282\u20133). In changes made to\npreviously published works, two years later (1695), Malebranche even\nmore explicitly ties the intelligibility of ideas to their causal\nefficacy (Robinet 1965, 259, note 2). Readers are told for the first\ntime that the reason ideas are intelligible and bodies are not is\nbecause only the former can act on the mind.\n\nThe theory that ideas are efficacious becomes Malebranche\u2019s\nmature position, and to mark this development changes are made to\nlater editions of the Search and to other writings. With the\nadvent of this theory, it becomes easier to see the relation between\nVision in God and Malebranche\u2019s other main doctrine of\nOccasionalism, or the view that God is the only genuine cause. Indeed,\none can regard Vision in God as a corollary to Occasionalism. As the\nonly true cause, God produces minds, bodies, and the various changes\nthey endure. The mind\u2019s nature is to think and to perceive, and\nGod produces those modifications via ideas, which are the instruments\nby which he enlightens us.\n\nMake no mistake about it, the theory of efficacious ideas marks a\nsignificant development in the doctrine of Vision in God. One\ncommentator aptly notes that Malebranche\u2019s epistemology shifts\nfrom being a vision in God to a vision by God\n(Alqui\u00e9 1974, 209). Ideas are no longer the direct objects of\nperception, passively awaiting our reflection upon them, but the\nactive agents of cognition. Moreover, whereas on Malebranche\u2019s\nearlier view ideas figured exclusively in the intellectual side of\nperception, on the new version of the doctrine they cause both our\nsensations and what he came to call our \u2018pure perceptions\u2019\n(perceptions pures). Malebranche had been reluctant\npreviously to say that ideas are \u2018sensible\u2019 lest he\nattribute colors and other sensible qualities to God. But on the\nrevamped doctrine he can say that ideas are both sensible and\nintelligible insofar as they causally affect our mind in different\nways (Schmaltz 2000, 80). \u2018When the idea of extension affects or\nmodifies the soul with a pure perception, then the soul conceives\nsimply this extension. But when the idea of extension touches the soul\nmore sharply, and affects it with a sense perception, then the soul\nsees, or senses extension\u2019 (Christian Conversations3,\nOC 4:75\u20136). Thus, the theory of efficacious ideas enables\nMalebranche to offer a more unified theory of cognition.\n6. Skepticism\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Descartes\u2019 epistemological project is\nits obsession with refuting skepticism. Descartes begins his\nMeditations by entertaining the widest and most radical\ndoubts possible so that he can defeat them once and for all. Some\ncommentators have suggested that Malebranche\u2019s doctrine of\nVision in God is also designed to refute skepticism, at least\nconcerning our knowledge of the essence of material things, but in\nfact the relation of his epistemology to skepticism is more complex,\nand he is best read as aiming for something more modest. Although\nMalebranche is as obsessed as Descartes with finding the correct\nmethod for discovering the truth, nothing like the Cartesian method of\nuniversal doubt can be found in his writings. There is a very simple\nreason for this: Malebranche refuses to take seriously some of the\nmore radical forms of skepticism. He never doubts that certain types\nof knowledge are possible. The task of the doctrine of Vision in God\nthen is not to refute skepticism, but to show how such\nknowledge is possible. The problem with rival theories of cognition,\nespecially Descartes\u2019, is that they encourage skepticism and\nfail to account for the knowledge we clearly have.\n\nAt times, Descartes seems to allow that there are some truths \u2013\nsuch as the simple propositions of mathematics \u2013 that can never\nbe doubted, but in darker moods that carry the day he worries whether\nan omnipotent deceiver might beguile us even about these. Malebranche,\nhowever, is more impressed by Descartes\u2019 first inclination. That\nI exist, that I have various thoughts, and that twice two equals four\nare not subject to deception but are known by what Malebranche calls\n\u2018simple perception,\u2019 by which the mind \u2018perceives a\nsimple thing without any relation to anything else whatsoever\u2019\n(Search 1.2, OC 1:49; LO 7). He opposes simple perception to\nreasoning or inference: whereas the former consists in a direct or\nimmediate grasp of something, reasoning constitutes an indirect\napprehension and involves more than one mental act (Schmaltz 1996,\n24). Because of the latter, reasoning requires the use of memory,\nwhich is subject to error and deception:\n\n\nFor when we reason, the memory acts; and where there is memory, there\ncan be error, should there be some evil genius on whom we depend in\nour knowledge who amuses himself by deceiving us\u2026. [But] I am\nquite persuaded that he could not deceive me in my knowledge through\nsimple perception\u2026. For even if I should really suppose such a\nGod, a God as powerful as I can imagine, I feel that in this\nextravagant supposition I could not doubt that I am, or that twice two\nequals four, because I perceive these things through simple perception\nwithout the use of memory. (Search 6.2.6, OC 2:370; LO\n480\u20131)\n\n\nMalebranche does not quite say here why he thinks things known through\nsimple perception are impervious to the omnipotent-deceiver doubt,\nthough his examples provide some indication. Descartes himself had\nsaid that even a malicious demon could not make him doubt his own\nexistence, at least while he is presently attending to this\nquestion. Such doubts are self-defeating: if the demon deceives\nme about anything then I must exist in order to be deceived. Rather\nthan offering an explanation of this kind, Malebranche is content here\nsimply to report on his own psychological response to the\n\u2018extravagant supposition\u2019 of a deceiving God, which fails\nto instill doubts in him about such simple truths. This supposition,\nhowever, does cause him to doubt things that depend on inference and\nhere he is quite explicit that this is due to the fallibility of\nmemory.\n\nTo defeat doubts of the latter variety, Malebranche thinks, \u2018It\nis \u2026 necessary to know by simple perception and not by inference\nthat God is not a deceiver, because reasoning can always be mistaken\nif we assume God to be a deceiver\u2019 (ibid., OC 2:371; LO 481).\nMalebranche is indicating here his own analysis of, and solution to,\nthe infamous Cartesian Circle. As he sees it, the Circle results from\n\u2018ordinary proofs of the existence and the perfections of\nGod\u2019 that involve inferences and hence are subject to the very\ndoubts that their conclusions are designed to dispel. Since on his\nview, simple perceptions are not subject to doubts of this or any\nkind, the only way to defeat the omnipotent deceiver doubt is by\nestablishing that God exists and is perfectly benevolent from\n\u2018proofs\u2019 by simple perception. The term\n\u2018proofs\u2019 here may seem confusing, given\nMalebranche\u2019s distinction between simple perception and\ninference, but he uses it loosely to refer to his version of the\nontological \u2018argument,\u2019 where God\u2019s existence is\nestablished directly from the idea of an infinite or supremely perfect\nbeing. Malebranche thinks that one of the virtues of the doctrine of\nVision in God is that it provides such a proof by simple perception.\nRecall from our earlier discussion in section 4 that Malebranche\nthinks we have an infinite cognitive capacity; for example, we can\nthink of any one of an infinite number of geometrical figures. A\nprecondition for this capacity, he maintains, is that we be in\nconstant and immediate union with the idea of being in general, which\nwe then delimit in various ways when thinking \u2018square,\u2019\n\u2018circle,\u2019 etc. But the idea of being in general or the\ninfinite can\u2019t be in any finite thing such as our mind. It can\nonly be in God \u2013 more precisely, it can only be God\nhimself, for there can be only one infinite or all-encompassing\nbeing:\n\n\nwe can only apprehend the infinite in the infinite itself\u2026. For\nthe first principle of our knowledge is that nothingness is not\nperceptible, whence if follows that, if we think of the infinite, it\nmust exist. We also see that God is not a deceiver, because, knowing\nthat He is infinitely perfect and that the infinite cannot lack any\nperfection, we clearly see that He does not want to beguile\nus\u2026. (ibid., OC 2:372; LO 481\u20132)\n\n\nAlthough Malebranche sometimes refers to the \u2018idea\u2019 of\nGod, strictly speaking, \u2018The infinite is its own idea\u2019\n(Dialogue 2, OC 12:53; JS 23). And we can explain our infinite\ncognitive capacity only by our union with this infinite being, who\nmust therefore exist.\n\nIn addition to thinking that there are some truths that are impervious\nto doubt, Malebranche also has a different understanding of\nDescartes\u2019 principle that whatever one clearly and distinctly is\ntrue. Descartes maintains that when I clearly and distinctly perceive\nsomething my will is causally compelled to affirm it. So, for example,\nif I understand the proposition that five is the sum of two added to\nthree then I will spontaneously affirm its truth. But as one\ncommentator has noted, Malebranche has a normative, rather than a\ncausal-psychological conception, of clear and distinct perceptions\n(Lennon 2000). Reason \u2018obliges,\u2019 rather than causally\ncompels, my will to assent. Indeed, I can resist a clear and distinct\nperception, but only at the risk of \u2018feeling an inward pain and\nthe secret reproaches of reason\u2019 (Search 1.2, OC 1:55;\nLO 10). This is significant because it explains why Malebranche\nrefuses to take some forms of skepticism seriously: skepticism with\nrespect to things perceived through clear and distinct perceptions is\nsimply perverse, for it violates norms to which reason demands\nadherence (Lennon 2000, 19).\n\nSo far, we have seen that Malebranche is concerned to defeat some\nforms of skepticism and is contemptuous and dismissive of others.\nAlthough Vision in God plays a prominent role in defeating skepticism\nof the first variety, regarding inference, its more primary task is to\nexplain how knowledge is possible. This point is evident in some of\nthe demonstrations that Malebranche marshals in support of the\ndoctrine, which have the character of \u2018transcendental\narguments.\u2019 Transcendental arguments typically begin with some\nclaim about knowledge that is taken as given. The transcendental move\nthen involves showing that such knowledge is possible only if some\ncondition, or set of conditions, has been satisfied. We might view the\nArgument from Properties, discussed in section 3, as an example of\nsuch an argument. Malebranche argues that the condition for the\npossibility of knowledge of truths that are necessary, immutable, and\ncommon to all minds or intelligences is that we see all things in\nGod:\n\n\nNo one disagrees that all men can know the truth, and even the least\nenlightened of philosophers agree that man participates in a certain\nReason that they do not determine \u2026. I see, for example,\nthat twice two is four, and that my friend is to be valued more than\nmy dog; and I am certain that no one in the world does not see this as\nwell as I\u2026. There must, therefore, be a universal Reason that\nenlightens me and all other intelligences. For if the reason I consult\nwere not the same that answers the Chinese, it is clear that I could\nnot be as certain as I am that the Chinese see the same truths as I do.\n(Elucidation 10, OC 3:129; LO 613)\n\n\nMalebranche begins here by assuming that we have knowledge of\nmathematical and moral truths. The problem involves showing\nhow this knowledge is possible, and he resolves it by\nappealing to Vision in God. The Argument from Properties is not the\nonly demonstration in Malebranche\u2019s arsenal that has a\ntranscendental flavor. Indeed, one can view all of his positive\narguments for Vision in God, including those discussed in section 4,\nas constituting an over-arching transcendental argument. Viewed in\nthis way, each of the considerations that he puts forth are not so\nmuch separate arguments as they are separate conditions for the\npossibility of knowledge that only Vision in God can jointly\nsatisfy.\n\nMalebranche\u2019s primary objection to other theories of cognition,\nthen, is that they fail to satisfy these conditions and, in the case\nof Descartes\u2019 theory in particular, encourage the\nskeptic\u2019s claim that we lack knowledge. Descartes\u2019 very\nconception of ideas as perceptions, or modifications of finite minds,\nmakes it impossible to guarantee that they accurately represent their\nobjects:\n\n\nFor if our ideas were only our perceptions, if our modes were\nrepresentative, how would we know that things correspond to our ideas,\nsince God does not think, and consequently does not act, according to\nour perceptions but according to His own; and therefore He did not\ncreate the world according to our perceptions but in accordance with\nHis ideas, on its eternal model that He finds in His essence\n(Search 4.11, OC 2:99; LO 320).\n\n[T]o maintain that ideas that are eternal, immutable, and common to\nall intelligences, are only perceptions or momentary particular\nmodifications of the mind, is to establish Pyrrhonism and to make room\nfor the belief that what is moral or immoral is not necessarily so,\nwhich is the most dangerous error of all. (Elucidation 10, OC 3:140; LO\n620)\n\n\nAs discussed in section 3, Descartes insists that our ideas of\ngeometrical figures and the like are \u2018eternal\u2019 and\n\u2018immutable\u2019 (and Malebranche takes him also to hold that\nthey are \u2018common to all intelligences\u2019), but Malebranche\nwonders here how this can be possible if they are merely fleeting\nmodes of finite minds. To identify ideas with such modes suggests that\nthey are merely subjective representations that vary among perceivers,\nand whose correspondence to reality can never be established. It thus\ninvites skepticism (or \u2018Pyrrhonism,\u2019 an ancient form of\nskepticism, though here the term just means radical or universal\nskepticism) regarding our knowledge of the essences of created\nthings.\n\nAgain, the virtue of Vision in God is that rather than encouraging\nskepticism, it shows how knowledge is possible. If ideas are eternal\nand immutable realities in God that serve as his archetypes for\ncreation, then there is no problem about whether they conform to their\nobjects. On the contrary, created objects must conform to them:\n\n\nIt is certain that things conform to the idea that God has of them.\nFor since God created them, He can only have made them according to\nthe idea that He has of them. Now according to the opinion that I\nmaintain, the idea that I have of extension in length, breadth, and\ndepth is not a modification of my soul: it is eternal, immutable,\nnecessary, common to God and all intelligences, and this idea is the\nmodel of created extension from which all bodies are formed. I can\nthus affirm with truth of created extension what I see contained in\nthis uncreated idea. (OCM 9:925\u20136)\n\n7. Objections and Replies\n\nAlthough Malebranche had his share of admirers and imitators, he also\nhad his share of critics. The theory of Vision in God was subjected to\nsevere and sometimes bitter attacks by some of his contemporaries,\nespecially Cartesians such as Arnauld and R\u00e9gis who saw\nthemselves as defending the legacy of Descartes against a corrupting\ninfluence. Fortunately for us, Malebranche was eager to defend himself\nand his replies to criticisms often help elucidate and amplify his\noriginal doctrine, as stated in the first edition (1674) of the\nSearch After Truth. In some cases, these replies are quite\nextensive. Although the dispute with Arnauld ranged over other topics,\nand was originally sparked by theological differences, it lasted some\n11 years and occupies several volumes (four of Malebranche\u2019s,\ntwo of Arnauld\u2019s) of their collected works. Some of\nMalebranche\u2019s critics were dismissive of his doctrine.\n\u2018[Vision in God] is an opinion that spreads not and is like to\ndie of itself, or at least do no great harm,\u2019 John Locke was\nreported as saying three days before his death (quoted in Cranston\n1957, 478). Malebranche, however, could be equally disparaging of his\nopponents. To his critic Simon Foucher, he quipped: \u2018When one\ncriticizes a book, it seems to me necessary at least to have read\nit\u2019 (OC 2:496). But once the dust from the ad hominems\nsettled, several important philosophical issues became apparent. We\nshall begin here by discussing objections to the doctrine that were\nprevalent in Malebranche\u2019s own time and his replies to them.\nWe\u2019ll focus on internal criticisms, that is, objections\nthat purport to expose incoherencies, unsound arguments, and\ninconsistencies with larger aspects of his philosophy (as opposed to\ncomplaints, for example, about his Cartesian infidelities). Toward the\nend of this section, we shall examine a few objections that have been\nraised by recent commentators.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with an objection that may have already occurred to\nthe reader. Malebranche claims that the idea of the infinite cannot be\na modification of our mind, for our mind is finite; it can only reside\nin God, the sole infinite being. But anyone familiar with\nDescartes\u2019 causal argument for God\u2019s existence, from the\nThird Meditation, knows that he argued otherwise. We have an innate\nidea of an actually infinite being that has been implanted in us by\nGod himself. How, as finite beings, can we contain such an idea? To\nanswer this question, Descartes drew an important distinction between\ntwo aspects of an idea \u2013 its so-called \u2018formal\u2019\nbeing and its \u2018objective,\u2019 or representational, being.\nFormal being is the kind of being or reality that ideas have in virtue\nof being modes or modifications of one\u2019s mind. As such, they all\nhave the same degree of finite reality. Whether I am thinking of the\nsun, my own mind, or an infinite substance, my ideas in this case are\nall finite, formally speaking. However, insofar as they represent\ndifferent things to my mind, my ideas have different degrees of what\nhe calls \u2018objective reality,\u2019 exploiting a notion\nprevalent among scholastic philosophers. The idea of myself as a\nthinking thing, for example, has a finite degree of objective reality,\nwhile the idea of God has an infinite degree of such reality. The\nlevel of objective reality of an idea is determined by the level of\nreality that the object it represents has formally. So Descartes\nthought that as a finite being, my ideas must all have a finite degree\nof formal reality, but they can have varying degrees of objective\nreality all the way up to the infinite level. He would thus reject\nMalebranche\u2019s claim that insofar as my ideas represent something\ninfinite, they must reside in God.\n\nOne should not suppose that Malebranche was unaware of\nDescartes\u2019 distinction between formal and objective reality. On\nthe contrary, he casts the distinction in even starker terms: the\nmind\u2019s perceptions have formal reality, and only formal\nreality, for they do not represent anything beyond themselves.\nObjective reality is reserved for ideas in God, the only\nrepresentative beings. But why can\u2019t ideas be perceptions in\nfinite minds? In particular, why can\u2019t our mind have an idea\nwith infinite objective reality? As faithful Cartesians, Arnauld and\nR\u00e9gis both raise this objection against Malebranche, though\nusing slightly different technical vocabulary. Instead of speaking of\nformal and objective reality, they speak of something being finite or\ninfinite in essendo as opposed to finite or infinite in\nrepraesentando, respectively. Addressing Malebranche directly,\nArnauld writes:\n\n\n[I]t is not true that a modality of our soul, which is finite, cannot\nrepresent an infinite thing; and it is true, on the contrary, that\nhowever finite our perceptions may be, there are some which must pass\nfor infinite in this sense, that they represent the infinite. This is\nwhat M. R\u00e9gis correctly maintained to you, and what he meant by\nthese terms, that they are finite in essendo, and infinite\nin repraesentando. You are not happy with this distinction.\nToo bad for you. (OA 40:88\u20139; also see R\u00e9gis SG\n1:194)\n\n\nMalebranche responds:\n\n\n[S]ince [the modalities of our soul] are finite, we cannot find the\ninfinite there, since nothingness is not visible, and one cannot\nperceive in the soul what is not there. Similarly, from the fact that\nI perceive in a circle an infinity of equal diameters, or rather, from\nthe fact that there are equal diameters therein in\nrepraesentando, I must concede that they are really there in\nessendo. For, in effect, a circle contains the reality of an\ninfinity of diameters. In order, then for a reality to be present to\nthe mind, for it to affect the mind, for the mind to perceive or\nreceive it, it necessarily must really be there. (OC 9:954)\n\n\nMalebranche\u2019s reply is subtle and lends itself to multiple\ninterpretations (see e.g., Nadler 1992, 41f; Radner 1978, 107\u20138,\n110\u201318 and Schmaltz 2000, 73). One way to understand it is to\ncompare it to a causal principle that Descartes invokes in his\nargument for God\u2019s existence in the Third Meditation. He claims\nthat the objective reality of an idea (such as that of God) must have\na cause with at least as much formal reality. Using this\nprinciple, he concludes that only a being with infinite formal reality\ncan be the cause of the (infinite) objective reality of my idea of\nsuch being. Now, Malebranche is not concerned with causes in this\ncontext but with what is required for something to be present to the\nmind; nevertheless, he is making the same general point: something\ncannot give what reality it does not have. In perceiving a general\nidea, such as a circle, we are able to perceive an infinite number of\npossible diameters (and thus an infinity of possible particular\ncircles). Thus, the general idea of circle contains an infinite degree\nof reality. If this idea were a modification of my mind, my mind\nitself would have to be infinite, which it clearly is not.\n\nHow should we assess Malebranche\u2019s reply? To the contemporary\nreader, the suggestion that ideas and things can have different levels\nof reality or being sounds bizarre, but to his seventeenth-century\nreaders, especially his Cartesian adversaries, this was a common view.\nEvaluated from that perspective, Malebranche\u2019s response holds up\nwell.\n\nLet us now consider a second objection, related to the first. A good\ngeneral source of objections to Vision in God is Malebranche\u2019s\nown Elucidations, which was first appended to the\nSearch in 1678, only four years after the original edition.\nThere he faces objections that had already been raised against the\ndoctrine, but also anticipates criticisms that were to be developed\nlater, such as Arnauld\u2019s worry that Vision in God reduces to\nVision of God, which we have already discussed. One of the\nobjections canvassed there raises a cluster of difficulties.\nMalebranche claims that God is the locus of intelligibility, but why\ncouldn\u2019t this \u2018intelligible world\u2019 (monde\nintelligible) reside in our own mind? God supposedly sees all\npossible creatures in his own perfections, but why couldn\u2019t the\nmind see extension at least in its own being? Malebranche subscribes\nto what might be called a \u2018cognitive resemblance thesis,\u2019\nwhich holds that the immediate object of cognition must have the same\nnature as the mind, which is immaterial or spiritual. According to\nthis principle, in order for the mind to see material things in\nthemselves, it would have to be material. But how is God any better\noff here, as he too is immaterial? \u2018The soul is not material,\nadmitted. But God, though he is a pure spirit, sees bodies in himself;\nwhy could not the soul, then, see them by considering itself, even\nthough it itself is spiritual?\u2019 (OC 3:147, LO 624).\n\nTo answer this objection, Malebranche stresses the distinction between\ninfinite and finite natures, as he understands it: whereas the mind is\na limited, particular being, God is \u2018universal being\u2019 or\n\u2018being without restriction\u2019 that consists of an infinity\nof perfections. Because he is infinite and indeterminate, God can\ncontain the perfections of materials things in an\n\u2018eminent\u2019 or higher sense, without thereby becoming\nextended. \u2018But as the soul is a particular being, a limited\nbeing, it cannot have extension in it without becoming material,\nwithout being composed of two substances\u2019 (OC 3:148, ibid.). The\nthesis that God contains the perfections of created beings\n\u2018eminently,\u2019 as opposed to \u2018formally\u2019 or\nliterally, is one that Malebranche borrows from Descartes, but he puts\nhis own spin on it by conceiving God as a general being. Recall that\nMalebranche appropriates this conception from St. Thomas Aquinas and,\nindeed, invokes the saint\u2019s name here:\n\n\nGod\u2019s ideas of creatures are, as Saint Thomas says, only his\nessence, insofar as it is participable or imperfectly imitable, for\nGod contains every creaturely perfection, though in a divine and\ninfinite way; he is one and he is all\u2026. But the soul \u2026 is\na particular being, a very limited and imperfect being. Certainly it\ncannot see in itself what is not there in any way at all. How could we\nsee in one species of being all species of being, or in a finite and\nparticular being a triangle in general and infinite triangles? (OC\n3:149, LO 625)\n\n\nThe claim that God is \u2018being in general,\u2019 however, invites\nfurther objections, both theological and philosophical. The God of\nChristianity is supposed to be a personal savior who hears our prayers\nand absolves us of sin, not an abstract\n universal.[1]\n It may be difficult to save Malebranche (or Aquinas) from this\nobjection, but one should note that the \u2018God of the\nphilosophers,\u2019 conceived of in purely intellectual terms as an\ninfinite and all perfect being, is already removed from the more\nchurchly conception. To add that God is universal being takes us even\nfurther from that conception, though the Christian philosopher can\nalways insist that scripture need not be taken literally. Malebranche\nhimself maintains that his view of God follows from divine infinity,\nwhich of course has a scriptural basis.\n\nThe conception of God as being in general also offended the\nphilosophical sensibilities of the seventeenth century, which tended\nto favor a nominalist or conceptualist account of universals.\nAccording to this anti-Platonistic view, which had adherents among\nrationalists (e.g., Descartes) and empiricists (e.g., Locke) alike,\nthe only things that exist are particulars, and so-called universals\nsuch as numbers or geometric objects are merely concepts or names. To\nconceive God as a universal violates this creed and, in the view of\nLocke specifically, makes God a bare abstraction (McCracken 1983,\n139). Malebranche, however, maintains that the existence of God or\nbeing in general is necessary to explain the very possibility of\nabstract thought:\n\n\nthe mind would be incapable of representing universal ideas of genus,\nspecies, and so on, to itself had it not seen all beings contained in\none\u2026. [S]ense can be made of the way the mind knows certain\nabstract and general truths only through the presence of Him who can\nenlighten the mind in an infinity of different ways. (Search\n3.2.6, OC 1:441; LO 232)\n\n\nIt is not clear, however, that the possibility of abstract cognition\ndemands Vision in God. Some rival theories of abstract\ncognition, prevalent in the period, did not require a Platonistic\nontology, and arguably were more philosophically satisfying.\n\nThis brings us to yet another objection, concerning the ontology of\nideas in God. Following Descartes, Malebranche proclaims throughout\nhis work that everything that exists is either a substance or a\nmodification of a substance. Thus, it would seem that if ideas are in\nGod then they too must be either substances in their own right or\ndivine modifications. Malebranche explicitly denies the latter, for\nGod is immutable and thus \u2018incapable of modifications\u2019\n(Elucidation 10, OC 3:149; LO 625). But they cannot be substances\neither for that would violate the theological doctrine that God is\nperfectly simple (more on this below). Malebranche, it would appear,\nis forced to abandon his substance-mode ontology: \u2018I believe\nthat intelligible extension is neither a substance nor a modification\nof substance, notwithstanding the axiom of the Philosophers [that\neverything is a either a substance or a mode]\u2019 (OC 6:245). One\nmust be careful, however, not to read this remark as conceding defeat,\nfor in the continuation of this reply to Arnauld and in the passage\nabove, he identifies ideas with God\u2019s substance:\n\u2018God\u2019s ideas of creatures are \u2026 only His essence,\ninsofar as it is participable or imperfectly imitable\u2019\n(Elucidation 10, OC 3:149; LO 625). Perhaps Malebranche is not\ninconsistent after all for, as it turns out, ideas are substances,\njust not distinct substances. They are God\u2019s substance conceived\nof in a certain way. The problem, unfortunately, goes beyond the issue\nof whether Malebranche is inconsistent. We are never given a clear\naccount of the ontology of ideas; even in identifying them with God he\nmust rely on the Platonic metaphor of participation.\n\nThere is also considerable pressure in Malebranche\u2019s philosophy\nagainst identifying ideas with God (even with all of the\nqualifications that identification usually assumes). In holding that\nGod creates via archetypes, Malebranche seems committed to the\nposition that ideas are discrete, and not just as we perceive them but\nfor God himself. This may require only one idea of extension, but\nthere also must be an idea of the mind. This again raises the problem\nof reconciling the theory of ideas with divine simplicity, a doctrine\nto which Malebranche is strongly committed and, ironically, to which\nhe appeals in arguing for Vision in God (see section 4). Even two\ndiscrete ideas in God would be sufficient to violate his simplicity,\nand sometimes Malebranche speaks as if there are more. He recognizes\nthat there is a problem here: \u2018there is a great deal of\ndifficulty in reconciling the Divine Being\u2019s simplicity with\nthis variety of intelligible ideas that He contains in His\nwisdom\u2019 (ibid., OC 3:137, LO 618). But his only solution is to\nappeal to divine incomprehensibility. \u2018[T]he divine substance in\nits simplicity \u2026 is beyond our reach\u2026.\u2019 (Dialogue 2,\nOC 12:52; JS 22).\n\nFar from trying to reconcile divine simplicity with his theory of\nideas, Malebranche seems to exacerbate the problem in some of the ways\nhe characterizes ideas. In Elucidation 10 and elsewhere, for example,\nhe speaks of the \u2018parts\u2019 of intelligible extension (see\ne.g., Elucidation 10, OC 3:152\u20133; LO 627). This locution led\nArnauld and others to worry not just about divine simplicity but\nwhether Malebranche was a Spinozistic pantheist who identified God\nwith extension. Malebranche replied that by \u2018parts\u2019 he\nmeant intelligible parts, not spatial ones (Dialogue 4, OC\n12:95, JS 58), but it is not clear how this solves the problem,\nespecially since these so-called intelligible parts continue to\nfunction like spatial ones within his theory, becoming larger or\nsmaller depending on the object we are perceiving and our perspective\non it (Radner 1978, 117f). The charge of Spinozism would continue to\nhaunt Malebranche throughout his career and was developed with even\ngreater zeal by a former student named Dortuous de Mairan toward the\nend of his life.\n\nOne recent commentator has tried to make sense of Malebranche\u2019s\ntalk of intelligible parts, in a way that preserves God\u2019s\nsimplicity and avoids the dangers of pantheism, by conceiving\nintelligible extension as a set of \u201cpoint-like entities\u201d\nthat correspond to material extension. Jasper Reid stresses that the\nformer are not real points and that the relation between them is not\none of actual distance. Indeed, he maintains that these intelligible\npoints are points only in relation to the intellect that conceives\nintelligible extension in a partial manner. One virtue of this\ninterpretation, he argues, is that it establishes an isomorphism or\nidentity of structure between intelligible extension and the corporeal\nworld without making the former materially extended (2003, 600).\nReid\u2019s view is motivated in part by the conviction that\nMalebranche conceived representation in terms of resemblance.\nIntelligible extension can represent the material world only if it\nresembles it in some way. He sees Malebranche\u2019s talk of\nintelligible parts as gesturing at the aforementioned structural\nresemblance. Reid\u2019s view is very ingenious but it suffers from\nphilosophical and textual shortcomings. Although one other commentator\n(Watson 1966) has argued that Malebranche conceived representation in\nterms of resemblance, the textual basis for such a claim is rather\ndubious (see Nadler 1992, 46f). More fatally, Reid\u2019s view\nrequires that one conceive of material extension as consisting of a\nsystem of extensionless points, but, like other mathematical objects,\npoints are abstractions or idealizations that do not exist in nature.\nAs Malebranche notes in the Search, \u201cNature is not abstract: the\nlevers and balls of mechanics are not the lines and circles of\nmathematics\u201d (OC 2:277; LO 428). In short, Reid\u2019s view\nworks only if one idealizes material extension, something Malebranche\nrefuses to do.\n\nRecent commentators have developed some of the traditional criticisms\nof the doctrine of Vision in God and proposed new ones of their own.\nThese days many commentators are impressed by the link between\nMalebranchean ideas and logical concepts (e.g., Jolley 1990, McCracken\n1983, Nadler 1992, Pyle 2003). Whereas Cartesian ideas were\npsychological entities or modes of finite minds, Malebranchean ideas\nare abstract, logical entities residing in a third realm (over and\nabove minds and bodies). The virtue of this conception is that it\nexplains how two or more people can be said to be thinking of the same\nabstract object, such as the number \u2018two,\u2019 and how various\nproperties, such as the Pythagorean Theorem, can be said to follow\nlogically from the idea of a right triangle. It also pushes\nMalebranche closer to Frege, Kant, and other more recent philosophical\nheroes, and makes him appear prescient with respect to certain\ninsights characteristic of contemporary analytic philosophy.\n\nOn the other hand, it also resurrects with renewed vigor some of the\nproblems considered above. Most notably, if ideas are abstract,\nlogical entities, then they are even more difficult to reconcile with\nMalebranche\u2019s substance-mode ontology. Indeed, one commentator\nhas argued that, to avoid inconsistency, Malebranche ought to have\nmade a clean break with the Cartesian assumption that everything is\neither a substance or a mode in favor of a more\n\u2018trialistic\u2019 view that grants that ideas, qua\nthird realm entities, are sui generis (Jolley 1990, 79). As\nabstract entities, it is also difficult to understand how ideas can\nhave causal powers, in keeping with the doctrine of efficacious ideas,\nor how they can be identical with God\u2019s substance (Jolley 1990,\n76f). In Malebranche\u2019s defense, one might note that the latter\nproblem arises only from regarding ideas as logical entities. Perhaps\nideas in God should not be conceived in this manner (Pepper-Bates\n2005, 93).\n\nAmong recent objections to Vision in God, one of the most important\nconcerns the relation of intelligible extension to sensations. As we\nhave seen, Malebranche draws an important distinction between these\nbut also thinks that sense perception combines elements of each. To\nthe sensory component Malebranche accords a crucial role in explaining\nhow intelligible extension is \u2018particularized\u2019 or\nindividuated, so as to represent a material object in the world.\nSensations of color and light, he says, are \u2018projected\u2019 or\n\u2018painted\u2019 onto intelligible extension as if it were an\nartist\u2019s canvas. The problem, however, is in understanding how\nthese radically disparate entities \u2013 ideas and sensations\n\u2013 can have any commerce with each other. Even if we reject the\nreading that ideas are logical entities, they are nevertheless general\nand pure, and thus different in kind from sensations.\n\nOne proposed solution to this difficulty involves the notion of\n\u2018seeing as\u2019 (see Nolan 2012, 27\u201332).\nMalebranche\u2019s painting analogy is merely a metaphor. Sensations\nof course are not literally painted onto intelligible extension. In\nfact, intelligible extension is not altered by our perception of it\nsince, like all things in God, it is immutable. Rather, we see\nintelligible extension as a particular object, such as a tree\nor a mountain, even though its intrinsic nature is very different.\nThese different ways of perceiving nevertheless qualify as cases of\nseeing intelligible extension because, according to the doctrine of\nefficacious ideas, it causes us to perceive it in these different\nways. In fact, when intelligible extension affects our mind with one\nset of sensations, we see it as a mountain; when it produces another\nset of sensations in us, we see it as a white-winged bird flying\nagainst a blue sky, etc. Malebranche writes:\n\n\nthere need be in God no sensible bodies or real figures in\nintelligible extension in order for us to see them in God or for God\nto see them in Himself. It is enough that His substance, insofar as\nthe corporeal creature can participate in it, should be able to be\nperceived in different ways. (Elucidation 10, OC 3:152; LO 626;\nemphasis added)\n\n\nLater in the same work he adds: \u201cwe see all things in God\nthrough the efficacy of his substance, and particularly sensible\nthings, through God\u2019s applying intelligible extension to our\nmind in a thousand different ways\u201d (OC 3:154, LO 628).\n\nOne attraction of this interpretation is that it also provides a\nsatisfying reply to de Mairan\u2019s objection, considered above,\nthat Malebranche succumbs to Spinozism by ascribing parts to\nintelligible extension. Once again, Malebranche could avail himself of\nthe notion of seeing as: we see intelligible extension as having parts\neven though it lacks real parts because it causes us to do so. Given\nMalebranche\u2019s representationalism, seeing intelligible extension\nin this way explains how we see the material world as divided into\ndiscrete bodies (see Nolan 2012, 35\u201337).\n",
