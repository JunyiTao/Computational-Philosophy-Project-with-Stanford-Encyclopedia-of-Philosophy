    "main_text": "Pragmatic Encroachment\n12. Pragmatic Encroachment\n\nTraditional approaches to knowledge have it that knowledge has to do\nwith factors like truth and justification. Whether knowledge requires\nsafety, sensitivity, reliability, or independence from certain kinds\nof luck has proven controversial. But something that all of these\npotential conditions on knowledge seem to have in common is that they\nhave some sort of intimate connection with the truth of the relevant\nbelief. Although it is admittedly difficult to make the relevant\nconnection precise, there is an intuitive sense in which every factor\nwe\u2019ve examined as a candidate for being relevant to knowledge\nhas something to do with truth of the would-be knowledgeable\nbeliefs.\n\nIn recent years, some epistemologists have argued that focus on such\ntruth-relevant factors leaves something important out of our picture\nof knowledge. In particular, they have argued that distinctively\npragmatic factors are relevant to whether a subject has\nknowledge. Call this thesis \u201cpragmatic\n encroachment\u201d:[37]\n\n\nPragmatic Encroachment:\n\nA difference in pragmatic circumstances can constitute a difference in\nknowledge.\n\n\nThe constitution claim here is important; it is trivial that\ndifferences in pragmatic circumstances can cause differences\nin knowledge. For example, if the question of whether marijuana use is\nlegal in Connecticut is more important to Sandra than it is to Daniel,\nSandra is more likely to seek out evidence, and come to knowledge,\nthan Daniel is. This uninteresting claim is not what is at issue.\nPragmatic encroachment theorists think that the practical importance\nitself can make for a change in knowledge, without reliance on such\ndownstream effects as a difference in evidence-gathering activity.\nSandra and Daniel might in some sense be in the same epistemic\nposition, where the only difference is that the question is more\nimportant to Sandra. This difference, according to pragmatic\nencroachment, might make it the case that Daniel knows, but Sandra\ndoes\n not.[38]\n\nPragmatic encroachment can be motivated by intuitions about cases.\nJason Stanley\u2019s 2005 book Knowledge and Practical\nInterests argues that it is the best explanation for pairs of\ncases like the following, where the contrasted cases are evidentially\nalike, but differ pragmatically:\n\n\nLow Stakes. Hannah and her wife Sarah are driving\nhome on a Friday afternoon. They plan to stop at the bank on the way\nhome to deposit their paychecks. It is not important that they do so,\nas they have no impending bills. But as they drive past the bank, they\nnotice that the lines inside are very long, as they often are on\nFriday afternoons. Realizing that it wasn\u2019t very important that\ntheir paychecks are deposited right away, Hannah says, \u201cI know\nthe bank will be open tomorrow, since I was there just two weeks ago\non Saturday morning. So we can deposit our paychecks tomorrow\nmorning\u201d.\n\nHigh Stakes. Hannah and her wife Sarah are driving\nhome on a Friday afternoon. They plan to stop at the bank on the way\nhome to deposit their paychecks. Since they have an impending bill\ncoming due, and very little in their account, it is very important\nthat they deposit their paychecks by Saturday. Hannah notes that she\nwas at the bank two weeks before on a Saturday morning, and it was\nopen. But, as Sarah points out, banks do change their hours. Hannah\nsays, \u201cI guess you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know that the\nbank will be open tomorrow\u201d. (Stanley 2005: 3\u20134)\n\n\nStanley argues that the moral of cases like these is that in general,\nthe more important the question of whether p, the harder it is\nto know that p. Other, more broadly theoretical, arguments for\npragmatic encroachment have been offered as well. Fantl & McGrath\n(2009) argue that encroachment follows from fallibilism and plausible\nprinciples linking knowledge and action, while Weatherson 2012 argues\nthat the best interpretation of decision theory requires\nencroachment.\n\nPragmatic encroachment is not an analysis of knowledge; it is merely\nthe claim that pragmatic factors are relevant for determining whether\na subject\u2019s belief constitutes knowledge. Some, but not all,\npragmatic encroachment theorists will endorse a necessary\nbiconditional that might be interpreted as an analysis of knowledge.\nFor example, a pragmatic encroachment theorist might claim that:\n\n\nS knows that p if and only if no epistemic weakness\nvis-\u00e1-vis p prevents S from properly using\np as a reason for action.\n\n\nThis connection between knowledge and action is similar to ones\nendorsed by Fantl & McGrath (2009), but it is stronger than\nanything they argue for.\n\nPragmatic encroachment on knowledge is deeply controversial. Patrick\nRysiew (2001), Jessica Brown (2006), and Mikkel Gerken (forthcoming) have\nargued that traditional views about the nature of knowledge are\nsufficient to account for the data mentioned above. Michael\nBlome-Tillmann (2009a) argues that it has unacceptably\ncounterintuitive results, like the truth of such claims as\nS knows that p, but if it were more important, she\nwouldn\u2019t know, or S knew that p until the\nquestion became important. Stanley (2005) offers strategies for\naccepting such consequences. Other, more theoretical arguments against\nencroachment have also been advanced; see for example Ichikawa,\nJarvis, and Rubin (2012), who argue that pragmatic encroachment is at\nodds with important tenets of belief-desire psychology.\n",
