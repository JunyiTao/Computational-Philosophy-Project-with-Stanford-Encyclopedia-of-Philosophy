A thorough\nexplanation of what a deduction is, and what they are composed of,\nwill necessarily lead us through the whole of his theory. What, then,\nis a deduction? Aristotle says:\n\nA deduction is speech (logos) in which, certain things having\nbeen supposed, something different from those supposed results of\nnecessity because of their being so. (Prior Analytics I.2,\n24b18\u201320)\n\n\nEach of the \u201cthings supposed\u201d is a\npremise (protasis) of the argument, and what\n\u201cresults of necessity\u201d is the conclusion\n(sumperasma).\n\nThe core of this definition is the notion of \u201cresulting of\nnecessity\u201d (ex anank\u00eas sumbainein). This\ncorresponds to a modern notion of logical consequence: \\(X\\) results\nof necessity from \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) if it would be impossible for \\(X\\)\nto be false when \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) are true. We could therefore take\nthis to be a general definition of \u201cvalid argument\u201d.\n",
