    "main_text": "\n\n\nResearch on \u201cimplicit bias\u201d suggests that people can act\non the basis of prejudice and stereotypes without intending to do so.\nWhile psychologists in the field of \u201cimplicit social\ncognition\u201d study consumer products, self-esteem, food, alcohol,\npolitical values, and more, the most striking and well-known research\nhas focused on implicit biases toward members of socially stigmatized\ngroups, such as African-Americans, women, and the\nLGBTQ\n community.[1]\nFor example, imagine\nFrank, who explicitly believes that women and men are equally suited\nfor careers outside the home. Despite his explicitly egalitarian\nbelief, Frank might nevertheless behave in any number of biased ways,\nfrom distrusting feedback from female co-workers to hiring equally\nqualified men over women. Part of the reason for Frank\u2019s\ndiscriminatory behavior might be an implicit gender bias. Psychological\nresearch on implicit bias has grown steadily (\u00a71), raising\nmetaphysical (\u00a72), epistemological (\u00a73), and ethical\nquestions\n (\u00a74).[2]\n",
