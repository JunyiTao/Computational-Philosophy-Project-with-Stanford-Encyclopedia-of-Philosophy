    "main_text": "\n\n\nAtomism in the form in which it first emerged in Ancient Greece was a\nmetaphysical thesis, purporting to establish claims about the ultimate\nnature of material reality by philosophical argument. Versions of\natomism developed by mechanical philosophers in the seventeenth\ncentury shared that characteristic. By contrast, the knowledge of\natoms that is now taken for granted in modern science is not\nestablished by a priori philosophical argument but by appeal\nto quite specific experimental results interpreted and guided by a\nquite specific theory, quantum mechanics. If metaphysics involves an\nattempt to give an account of the basic nature of material reality\nthen it is an issue about which science rather than philosophy has\nmost to say. A study of the path from philosophical atomism to\ncontemporary scientific atomism helps to shed light on the nature of\nphilosophy and science and the relationship between the two.\n\n\nFrom the nineteenth century onwards, when serious versions of\nscientific atomism first emerged, the philosophical relevance of a\nhistory of atomism becomes epistemological rather than metaphysical.\nSince atoms lie far beyond the domain of observation, should\nhypotheses concerning them form part of empirical science? There were\ncertainly philosophers and scientists of the nineteenth century who\nanswered that question in the negative. Contemporary philosophers\ndiffer over the question of whether the debate was essentially a\nscientific one or a philosophical one. Was there a case to oppose\natomism on the grounds that it was unfruitful or lacking in adequate\nexperimental support, or did such a case stem from some general\nepistemological thesis, perhaps some brand of positivism, that ruled\nout of court any attempt to explain observable phenomena by invoking\nunobservable atoms? Many contemporary philosophers see the ultimate\ntriumph of atomism as a victory for realism over positivism. Such\nclaims are historical as well as philosophical, so it is important to\nget the history straight when evaluating them. In this respect the\nphilosophical literature has yet to catch up with recent advances in\nthe history of nineteenth-century chemistry. This entry gives an\naccount of the key developments in atomism from the seventeenth\ncentury until the time, early in the twentieth century, when the\nexistence of atoms ceased to be a contentious issue. The focus is on\nthe epistemological status of the various versions, and on the\nrelationship between science and philosophy.\n",
