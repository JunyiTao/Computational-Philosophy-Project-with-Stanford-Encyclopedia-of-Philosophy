    "main_text": "Philosophy of Human Nature and Approach to Self-Cultivation\n2. Philosophy of Human Nature and Approach to Self-Cultivation\n\nZhu Xi developed a theory of basic human propensities (nature,\nxing) to account for both the possibility of human evil and\nthat of human goodness and perfectibility. On this theory, while\n(following Mencius, 372\u2013289 BCE) insisting that people are\nbasically good (well intended and sensitive to the sufferings of\nothers), he accepted that the manner in which a person\u2019s basic\ndisposition is manifested is conditioned and at times contained by\ntheir specific qi endowment (native talents and\ngifts, qizhi), family and social environment, and other\nfactors. Such factors together yield their empirical personality,\nintelligence, and aptitude for spiritual-ethical cultivation. Zhu\naccepted that there are real differences in individual disposition,\ncharacter, as well as aptitude for ethical self-cultivation and\nrealization, owing to individual variations in\nqi endowment, environment, etc. Furthermore, he argued that\npeople can become bad or evil due, for example, to a coarse or sensual\nqi endowment, the bad influence of ruthless kin or friends, a\nselfish or harsh social environment, a cruel streak, etc. Nonetheless,\nfollowing Mencius, he firmly believed that anyone who was sincerely\ncommitted to moral self-cultivation and was fervent in their moral practice\nwould surely make progress in achieving moral realization if not sagehood.\n\nZhu Xi\u2019s teacher, Li Tong, and friend, Zhang Shi (1133\u20131180),\npresented him with different approaches to cultivation based on the\npremise of basic still and active mindsets, respectively. But, Zhu\nfound that both of these approaches were one-sided and flawed. How is\none to leap from quiet-sitting and stillness to making timely moral\nresponses? When does one have the composure to introspect morally when\ntheir mind is constantly active and engaged? If neither the meditative\napproach nor the active approach to cultivation and practice were\nefficacious, what path remained open to Zhu Xi? Recent research shows\nthat Zhu Xi embarked on a careful reading of the works of Zhou Dunyi\nduring this period of spiritual-philosophical crisis in the course of which he\nrediscovered Zhou\u2019s doctrine of \u201cthe interpenetration of\nstillness and activity\u201d for the human mind and spirit (Adler\n2014). With this idea, Zhou Dunyi was advocating that whereas the\nstates of action and rest are mutually exclusive in the case of\nphysical objects, such states interpenetrate and are mutually\nimplicative in the case of human mental and spiritual phenomena (Adler\n2014). This doctrine piqued Zhu Xi\u2019s interest, and he came to\nsee it as offering a way out of the dilemma between Li Tong\u2019s\nstress on stillness and Hu Hong\u2019s stress on activity in\ncultivation and practice, and their respective shortcomings. Zhou\nDunyi\u2019s doctrine was particularly exciting to Zhu Xi for it\nhighlighted the distinctness and potential religiosity of the human\nmind and spirit, which Zhou describes as not subject to the same\nlimitations and restrictions as are physical phenomena. Zhou Dunyi\nmoreover associates this idea with a vital and well integrated model\nof human mind and spirit, self-cultivation, and cosmos. Inspired by\nZhou Dunyi\u2019s doctrine of the interpenetration of stillness and\nactivity and related ideas, Zhu Xi worked out a twofold cultivation\neffort that incorporated at once nurturing one\u2019s feeling of\nreverence (jing) to purify mind while investigating things to\ndiscern their determinate or defining patterns (li).\nCultivation of reverence, originally a religious virtue associated\nwith ancestor worship and ceremonial rites, as described in the\nclassics and taught by Confucius (551\u2013479 BCE), serves to purify\nthe mind, attune one to the promptings of the original good nature,\nand set one to act with appropriateness (yi). Moreover, by\ngrasping the defining patterns (li) of relationship and\nintercourse that constitute the world, society, people, and proper\nconduct, one gains the master key to acting with utmost propriety\n(zhongyong). The mind that is imbued with reverence and\ncomprehends these patterns will develop into a good will\n(zhuzai) dedicated to acting appropriately and with utmost\npropriety. Since jing takes on connotations of focus,\nconcentration, and alertness, as well as reverence in Zhu Xi\u2019s\ndiscourses, mindfulness has been suggested as the English translation\nthat covers the fullness of the term jing (Kalton 1988) in\nZhu Xi\u2019s thought.\n\nIn later life, Zhu started to regard this twofold approach to\ncultivation and realization as too complicated, gradual, and difficult\nto carry out in practice. Like Confucius before him and anticipating\nWang Yangming after him, Zhu Xi came to accept that the sincere\nConfucian adept must, on embarking on his or her project of ethical\nself-cultivation, first strive to establish his or her sincere\ndetermination (lizhi) to realize the cardinal Confucian\nvirtues and become an exemplary person (junzi), that is to\nsay, a master of appropriateness in interpersonal conduct and human\naffairs generally.\n",
