    "main_text": "\n1. Knowledge, Justification and Skepticism\n\nPhilosophically interesting forms of skepticism claim that we do not\nknow propositions which we ordinarily think we do know. We should\ndistinguish such skepticism from the ordinary kind, the claim that we\ndo not know propositions which we would gladly grant not to know.\nThus, it is a form of ordinary skepticism to say that we do not know\nthat there are an even number of stars in the Milky Way, but it is a\nform of philosophical skepticism to say that we do not know that the\nsun will come out tomorrow. Even though our interest is in\nphilosophical skepticism, we can start our inquiry by thinking about\nordinary skepticism.\n\nWhy do we readily grant, then, that we don\u2019t know that there are\nan even number of stars in the Milky Way? To begin with, the vast\nmajority of us do not even believe that proposition, and it is widely\nacknowledged that knowledge requires\n belief.[1]\n But even those who believe it do not know it, even if they luck out\nand it is true. They do not know it because they are not\njustified in believing it, and knowledge requires\n justification.[2]\n Of course, they are not justified in disbelieving that proposition\neither. Belief and disbelief are two of the so-called doxastic\nattitudes that we can adopt towards a proposition. We can also,\nof course, not even consider a proposition, and thus not adopt any\ndoxastic attitude towards it. But most philosophers would hold that in\naddition to belief and disbelief there is a third possible doxastic\nattitude that we can adopt towards a proposition: we can suspend\njudgment (or withhold assent) with respect to it. Suspension of\njudgment is thus a bona fide doxastic attitude alongside\nbelief and disbelief, and is not to be equated with the failure to\nadopt any doxastic\n attitude.[3]\n Because it is a genuine doxastic attitude, suspension of judgment\n(just like belief and disbelief, and unlike the failure to form any\ndoxastic attitude) can itself be justified or unjustified. For\ninstance, we would ordinarily think that suspension of judgment is\nnot justified with respect to the proposition that Paris is\nthe Capital of France, but it is with respect to the proposition that\nthere are an even number of stars in the Milky Way.\n\nSome arguments for philosophical skepticism target knowledge directly,\nnot concerning themselves with justification. For instance, some argue\nthat we do not know certain propositions because our beliefs in them\nare not sensitive (in a sense to be explained below), and\nthey claim that sensitivity is a condition on knowledge\u2014but\nperhaps not on justified belief. We will examine the bearing of the\nsensitivity condition on skeptical arguments assuming that it applies\nto justification. But even if an argument for philosophical skepticism\ntargets our knowledge in a certain area while remaining silent about\nwhether we have justified beliefs in that area, that argument will\nstill indirectly target our justification as well. For, if the\nargument succeeds, then it provides us with knowledge (or at least\njustified belief) that we do not know a certain proposition p.\nAnd it is plausible to hold that if we know (or justifiably believe)\nthat we do not know a proposition p, then we are not even\njustified in believing p.\n\nIn what follows, then, we identify skepticism with respect to a field\nof propositions F as the claim that the only justified attitude\nwith respect to propositions in F is suspension of judgment.\nPhilosophical skepticism, then, differs from ordinary skepticism at\nleast regarding the field of propositions to which it is claimed to\napply. But even within the realm of philosophical skepticism we can\nmake an interesting distinction by appealing to the scope of the\nthesis.\n2. Two Basic Forms of Philosophical Skepticism\n\nOne interesting distinction between kinds of philosophical skepticism\npertains to the question whether they iterate. Thus, consider\nskepticism about the future: the claim that the only justified\nattitude with respect to propositions about the future is suspension\nof judgment. That kind of philosophical skepticism overlaps partly\nwith ordinary skepticism about the future. We should all grant, for\ninstance, that we should suspend judgment with respect to the\nproposition that the flip of this fair coin in the next second will\ncome up heads, but most of us think that we should believe, not\nsuspend judgment with respect to, the proposition that the sun will\ncome out tomorrow. Being a skeptic with respect to the first-order\nproposition that the sun will come out tomorrow (that is to say,\nholding that the only justified attitude with respect to that\nproposition is suspension of judgment) can be combined with any of the\nthree doxastic attitudes with respect to the second-order proposition\nthat the only justified attitude with respect to the proposition that\nthe sun will come out tomorrow is to suspend judgment. Generalizing,\nwhenever the skeptic holds that the only justified attitude with\nrespect to a field of propositions F is to suspend judgment, we\ncan ask them which attitude is justified with respect to the\nproposition that the only justified attitude with respect to any\nproposition in F is suspension of judgment. Perhaps the most\nstraightforward answer here is that the only justified attitude with\nrespect to that second-order proposition is belief. After all,\nisn\u2019t skepticism with respect to F precisely the\nbelief that we should suspend judgment with respect to any proposition\nin F? We will call this combination of views\u2014the view\nthat we should suspend judgment with respect to any proposition in\nF and believe the proposition that we should suspend judgment\nwith respect to any proposition in F\u2014\u201cCartesian\nSkepticism\u201d, because of the skeptical arguments investigated by\nDescartes and his critics in the mid-seventeenth century. Other\nphilosophers, following an ancient tradition, refer to this view as\n\u201cAcademic Skepticism\u201d (see the entry on\n ancient skepticism).\n\nBut some skeptics are skeptics regarding second- (and higher-) order\npropositions as well as regarding first-order propositions. Following\nthe same ancient tradition, we will call that kind of skepticism\n\u201cPyrrhonian Skepticism\u201d. Without any claim to historical\naccuracy, we will take Pyrrhonian Skepticism to be absolute\nskepticism\u2014the thesis that suspension of judgment is the only\njustified attitude with respect to any proposition p.\nIs Pyrrhonian Skepticism so understood self-refuting? It is certainly\nformally consistent: no contradiction follows just from the\npropositions that the only justified attitude with respect to the\nproposition that p is suspension of judgment and that the only\njustified attitude with respect to the proposition that the only\njustified attitude with respect to the proposition that p is\nsuspension of judgment is suspension of judgment (say that three times\nfast!). But consider the principle that whenever someone is committed\nto a proposition p they are also (perhaps implicitly) committed\nto the proposition that belief is the (or at least a) justified\nattitude towards p. Call this the \u201cCommitment Iteration\nPrinciple\u201d. If the Commitment Iteration Principle holds, then\nPyrrhonian Skepticism is indeed self-refuting. For Pyrrhonian skeptics\nare committed to the claim that suspension of judgment is the only\njustified attitude with respect to some proposition p. By the\nCommitment Iteration Principle, they are then committed to the claim\nthat belief is a justified attitude with respect to the proposition\nthat suspension of judgment is the only justified attitude with\nrespect to p. Therefore, if they are in addition committed to\nthe claim that suspension of judgment is the only justified attitude\nwith respect to that very same proposition, they are committed to an\ninconsistent set of propositions. But Pyrrhonian skeptics need not\nhold the Commitment Iteration Principle. Indeed, they are committed to\nthinking that suspension of judgment is the only justified attitude\nwith respect to the Commitment Iteration Principle itself (and also\nwith respect to analogous principles which may make trouble for\nPyrrhonian Skepticism). Of course, Pyrrhonian Skepticism will not be\nacceptable to anyone who does hold the Commitment Iteration\nPrinciple\u2014but neither will Pyrrhonian Skepticism be acceptable\nto anyone who holds that we should not suspend judgment with respect\nto some proposition. It is not clear, then, that the charge of\nself-refutation represents an independent indictment of Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism. In any case, contemporary philosophers find Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism interesting not because they take seriously the possibility\nof its truth, but rather because there are interesting arguments in\nits favor, the responses to which shape the contours of many\ncontemporary epistemological theories.\n\nWe have distinguished between Cartesian and Pyrrhonian Skepticism, but\nwe have characterized both views in terms of a generic field of\npropositions F. In the case of Pyrrhonian Skepticism, F\nincludes every proposition, but we can generate different versions of\nCartesian Skepticism by varying F. A prominent version of\nCartesian Skepticism is external-world skepticism\u2014i.e.,\nCartesian Skepticism with respect to any proposition about the\n\u201cexternal world\u201d (not about the subject\u2019s own\n mind).[4]\n In what follows, we concentrate on external world Cartesian\nSkepticism and Pyrrhonian Skepticism.\n3. The Argument for Cartesian Skepticism Employing the Closure Principle\n\nMany contemporary philosophers take the canonical argument for\nCartesian Skepticism to involve skeptical hypotheses and a Closure\nPrinciple\n (CP).[5]\n A skeptical hypothesis (with respect to a proposition p and a\nsubject S) is a proposition SH such that if SH\nwere true, then: (a) S would not know p, and (b)\nS would not be able to distinguish SH from a situation\nwhere S knows p. The evil demon scenario that Descartes\nenvisions at the end of his \u201cFirst Meditation\u201d functions\nas a near-universal skeptical hypothesis, for the demon has the power\nto deceive any subject regarding almost any proposition. One way in\nwhich a SH may satisfy (a) is by describing a situation where\np is false, but this is not the only way. Descartes\u2019 evil\ndemon may induce in a disembodied subject\u2019s mind an experience\nas of the subject\u2019s own hands in front of her, as a result of\nwhich the subject believes that there are hands in front of her, while\nat the same time dangling some unattached hands in front of the\nsubject (we are waiving here difficulties having to do with how to\nlocate objects relative to disembodied subjects). The subject\u2019s\nbelief that there are hands in front of her is in that case true, but\nshe still doesn\u2019t know it. The connection between Closure\nprinciples and arguments for skepticism gets complicated if we\ncountenance skeptical hypotheses which do not entail the falsehood of\nthe proposition in question, and so in what follows we limit our\ndiscussion to those that do.\n\nLetting \u201ch\u201d stand for any proposition about the\nexternal world we would ordinarily take ourselves to be justified in\nbelieving, for example, G. E. Moore\u2019s famous \u201chere\u2019s\na hand\u201d (Moore 1939 [1993]), and re-using \u201cSH\u201d for a\nskeptical hypothesis relative to h (we leave the subject\ntacit), we can state the contemporary canonical CP-style argument\nfor Cartesian Skepticism as follows:\n\n\nCP1. If I am justified in believing that h, then I am\njustified in believing that \\({\\sim}\\textit{SH}\\).\nCP2. I am not justified in believing that\n\\({\\sim}\\textit{SH}\\).\nTherefore, I am not justified in believing that h.\n\n\n\nCP1 follows from the following Closure Principle (letting\n\u201cJx\u201d stand for the subject is justified in\nbelieving x):\n\n\nClosure Principle [CP]: For all\npropositions x and y, if x entails y, and\nJx, then Jy.\n\n\n(In the argument above, \\(x = h\\) and \\(y = {\\sim}SH\\).)\n\nA crucial feature of CP is that it does not depend upon employing a\nstringent notion of justification. Suppose that (positive)\njustification comes in degrees, where the lowest degree is something\nlike mere plausibility and the highest degree is absolute certainty.\nCP could be recast as follows:\n\n\nCP*: For all propositions, x and y, if\nx entails y, and Jx to degree u, then\nJy to degree v (where \\(u \\le v)\\).\n\n\nThere appear to be only three ways that one can respond to the\nCP-style skeptical argument: deny at least one premise, deny that the\nargument is valid, or reluctantly accept the conclusion\u2014if\nneither of the first two alternatives succeeds.\n3.1 Consideration of CP1\n\nLet us begin an examination of CP1 and the general closure principle,\nCP, of which CP1 is an instantiation. Closure certainly does hold for\nsome properties, for example, truth. If p is true and implies\nq, then q is true. It just as clearly does not hold for\nother properties, for example being surprising. It might be surprising\nthat Tom\u00e1s is taller than his father, but it is certainly not\nsurprising that Tom\u00e1s is taller than someone, and yet the\nformer entails the latter. What about justified belief? Does Closure\nhold for it?\n\nIt might be thought that the answer must be a clear \u201cNo\u201d,\nfor the following reasons. First, notice that every logical truth is\nentailed by every proposition. If Closure held for justification, then\nwe would have to say that everybody is justified in believing every\nlogical truth (provided that we are willing to grant that everybody is\njustified in believing at least one proposition). But this\ndoesn\u2019t seem plausible. Some logical truths are too complicated\nto even parse, let alone be justified in believing. If this is true,\nthen Closure doesn\u2019t hold for belief (that is to say, we may\nfail to believe propositions entailed by propositions we already\nbelieve). The existence of very complicated logical truths also\nunderlies another worry for Closure. For to every logical entailment\nbetween propositions there corresponds a logical truth: the (material)\nconditional with the entailing proposition in the antecedent and the\nentailed proposition in the consequent. Some of these logically true\nconditionals will be examples of propositions that we are not\njustified in believing (if only because the consequent is too\ncomplicated for beings like us to even parse). In that case, we might\nwell be justified in believing their antecedents without being\njustified in believing their consequents.\n\nBut it also appears that CP can easily be repaired. We can stipulate\n(i) that the domain of the propositions in the generalization of CP\nincludes only contingent propositions that are within S\u2019s\ncapacity to grasp and (ii) that the entailment is\n\u201cobvious\u201d to S. The skeptic can agree to those\nrestrictions because the skeptical scenarios are posited in such a way\nas to render it obvious that our ordinary beliefs are false in those\nscenarios, and it is taken to be a contingent claim that S is\nin the actual circumstances as described in the antecedent. (For a\nfull discussion of the required repairs of CP, see David &\nWarfield 2008 and Hawthorne 2014.)\n\nThere is one other important, required clarification of the restricted\nversion of CP. \u201cJustified belief\u201d is ambiguous. It could\nbe used to refer to a species of actually held beliefs\u2014namely,\nthose actually held beliefs of S that are justified. Or it\ncould refer to propositions that S is justified in\nbelieving\u2014regardless of whether S does indeed believe\nthem. Following Roderick Firth, the distinction between actually held\njustified beliefs and propositions one is justified in believing,\nregardless of whether they are actually believed, is often marked by\ndistinguishing between doxastic and propositional justification (see\nFirth 1978). If CP is to be acceptable, \u201cjustified in\nbelieving\u201d in the consequent must be used so as to refer to\npropositional justification for a reason already cited, i.e., that\nClosure does not hold for belief. In other words, one of\nS\u2019s actual beliefs, p, might be justified and\nS still fail to believe some proposition that is entailed by\n p.[6]\n\nWe are now in a position to ask: Does the restricted form of closure\nhold? There are at least three types of argument against closure in\nthe literature: alleged counterexamples, alleged unpalatable\nconsequences, and incompatibility with allegedly plausible\nepistemological theories. In the remainder of this section we examine\none exemplar of each of these.\n\nFred Dretske and others have produced cases in which they believe CP\n fails.[7]\n Dretske writes:\n\n\n\u2026something\u2019s being a zebra implies that it is not a\nmule\u2026cleverly disguised by the zoo authorities to look like a\nzebra. Do you know that these animals are not mules cleverly\ndisguised? If you are tempted to say \u201cYes\u201d to this\nquestion, think a moment about what reasons you have, what evidence\nyou can produce in favor of this claim. The evidence you had\nfor thinking them zebras has been effectively neutralized, since it\ndoes not count toward their not being mules cleverly\ndisguised to look like zebras. (Dretske 1970: 1015\u20131016)\n\n\nDretske is speaking of knowledge rather than justified beliefs, but\nthat seems irrelevant since the issue concerns the supposed lack of a\nsufficient source of evidence or reasons for the claim that the animal\nis not a cleverly disguised mule.\n\nThe crucial thing to note about this proposed counterexample is that\nit works only if the Closure Principle entails that the very same\nsource of evidence that justifies S in believing that the\nanimals are zebras must justify S in believing that they are\nnot cleverly disguised mules. Since the evidence for the former has\nbeen \u201ceffectively neutralized\u201d, it is not available for\nthe latter. Now, in response one could claim that once the question of\nwhether the animals are disguised mules has been raised, the evidence\nis \u201ceffectively neutralized\u201d for both the former and the\nlatter, and S is no longer justified in believing that the\nanimals are zebras. Thus, it could be held that this example could\nactually be used to support CP. Nevertheless, let us grant that the\nevidence for the claim that the animals are zebras cannot be used to\nshow that they are not cleverly disguised mules. Still, it could be\nargued that this would not force giving up CP.\n\nSuch an argument could begin by recalling that CP claimed merely that\nwhenever a subject is justified in believing p, then that\nsubject is justified in believing q. CP does not require that\nthe subject have the same evidence for p as she does for\nq. Dretske\u2019s purported counterexample seems to require\nthat CP implies that the adequate source of evidence is the same for\nboth propositions.\n\nNo doubt this constraint sometimes correctly portrays the relevant\nevidential relationships when some proposition entails some other\nproposition. For example, suppose I have adequate evidence for the\nclaim that Anne has two brothers. Then it would seem that the very\nsame evidence would be adequate for believing that Anne has at least\none brother. But the defender of CP, and more particularly the\nCartesian Skeptic, could point out that closure does not require this\nto hold for every case.\n\nThere are two other possibilities. First, one may hold that when\np entails q and there is some evidence e for\np, it is p itself that is evidence for q. For\nexample, it may be held that given that I have adequate evidence for\nbelieving that 2 is a prime number, I can use that very proposition\n(that 2 is a prime number) as an adequate reason for believing that\nthere is at least one even prime. (See Klein 1981, 1995, and 2000, but\nsee below for reasons for doubting that this is a genuine\npossibility.) Second, there are cases where the order is reversed\nbecause q serves as part of the evidence for p. For\nexample, suppose that I am justified, ceteris paribus, in\nbelieving that (pure) water is present if I am justified in believing\nthat there is present, at standard temperature and pressure, a clear,\nodorless, watery-tasting and watery-looking fluid that contains\nhydrogen and oxygen. This pattern is typical of abductive inferences,\nand is often referred to as \u201cinference to the best\nexplanation\u201d. (See Vogel 1990, 2014b for a discussion of Cartesian Skepticism and inference to\nthe best explanation.) In addition, there are cases in which it seems\nthat some contraries of h need to be eliminated prior to\nh\u2019s being justified. For example, reconsidering the\nzebra-in-the-zoo case, it seems to be true that if I had some good\nreason to think that the animals are cleverly disguised mules, such a\ncontrary would need to be eliminated before I would be justified in\nbelieving that the animals were\n zebras.[8]\n\nIt could also be argued that CP has unacceptable consequences. Of\ncourse, one of those unacceptable consequences may well be Cartesian\nSkepticism itself, but to point that out in the present context would\nbe dialectically unhelpful. It has been argued, however, that CP by\nitself has far-reaching skeptical consequences. Notice that the\nargument for Cartesian Skepticism under consideration contains CP2 as\nan essential premise. The present concern is that CP by itself (and\ntherefore CP1, if justified on the basis of CP), without help from\nCP2, has skeptical consequences. If that were true, that would be a\nreason to be wary of CP, for it would be a much stronger principle\nthan advertised.\n\nThe argument can be presented as a conflict between CP, on the one\nhand, and three other principles. Those three other principles are,\nallegedly, beyond reproach, and so CP is to be blamed for the\nconflict. The first principle in question may be thought of as\nenshrining the possibility of knowledge (and justification) by\nampliative inference:\n\n\nAmpliativity: It is possible for a subject S\nto be justified in believing h on the basis of evidence\ne even if S does not have independent justification (of\nat least the same degree of S\u2019s justification for\nbelieving h) for believing a proposition p such that\np and e together entail h.\n\n\nAmpliativity would be true if, for example, we can be justified in\nbelieving the conclusion of an inductive argument (say, that all\nemeralds are green) on the basis of believing its premises (say, that\na properly selected group of emeralds have been observed to be green),\nwithout in addition being independently justified in believing any\nother proposition which, together with those premises, entails the\nconclusion (such as, for example, the proposition that if a properly\nselected sample of emeralds have all been green, then all emeralds are\ngreen).\n\nThe next principle is in conflict with what we presented above as an\nalternative possibility to Dretske\u2019s interpretation of the\nevidential structure of CP. Dretske\u2019s counterexample works, we\nsaid, only if CP holds that whatever justifies the subject in\nbelieving p is also what justifies her in believing q.\nBut there are two other possibilities. Maybe the evidential relation\nis reversed: whatever justifies us in believing q justifies us\nin believing p. Or maybe, we said, p itself, and not\nwhatever justifies us in believing p, justifies us in believing\nq. The next principle goes directly against this\npossibility:\n\n\nMere Lemmas: If S is justified in believing\np on the basis of some evidence e, then p itself\ncan justify S in believing some other proposition q only\nif e justifies S in believing q.\n\n\nWe call the principle \u201cMere Lemmas\u201d because the idea\nbehind it is that if a proposition is a mere lemma, in the sense that\nit derives all of its justification from some prior evidence e,\nthen it doesn\u2019t have justificatory powers of its own,\nindependent of the justificatory powers of e. Suppose, for\ninstance, that you start out by knowing that Jim has a pet, but you\ndon\u2019t know what kind of pet it is (the example is from Pryor\n2004). Then you come to know that it is a hairless pet. Now you become\njustified (perhaps to a small degree) in believing that Jim\u2019s\npet is a hairless dog. That is to say, whatever degree of\njustification you had before to believe that Jim\u2019s pet is a\nhairless dog, you are now somewhat more justified in believing that\nsame proposition. That Jim\u2019s pet is a hairless dog of course\nentails that Jim\u2019s pet is a dog. But your justification for\nbelieving that Jim\u2019s pet is a hairless dog cannot in any way be\ntransmuted into justification for believing that Jim\u2019s pet is a\ndog. Whatever degree of justification you had before for believing\nthat Jim\u2019s pet is a dog, you are now less justified in believing\nthat same proposition (because hairless dogs are a small minority of\nhairless pets).\n\nBut what about the example with which we introduced the idea that,\nsometimes, when e is evidence for p, then p\nitself can be evidence for q? The example was the following: we\ncan have adequate evidence for believing that 2 is a prime number, and\nthen that proposition itself (that 2 is a prime number) can justify us\nin believing that that there is at least one even prime number. But,\nwhen examined more closely, this is not an obvious counterexample to\nMere Lemmas. For, what could our adequate evidence that 2 is a prime\nnumber be? Presumably, it would be that 2 is divisible only by 1 and\n2. That just is the definition of what it means for 2 to be a prime\nnumber, however, so some may balk at the idea that it counts as\nevidence for the proposition in question (rather than being identical\nwith it). In any case, it would not count as a counterexample to Mere\nLemmas. For if we have no evidence for the proposition that 2 is a\nprime number, then the condition for the application of Mere Lemmas is\nnot\n satisfied.[9]\n If, on the other hand, our evidence is that 2 is divisible only by 1\nand 2, then that proposition itself is obviously evidence for the\nproposition that an even number is prime.\n\nOur final principle is the following:\n\n\nEntailment: If p entails q, then\nq cannot justify S in disbelieving p.\n\n\nThe idea behind this principle is that if p entails q,\nthen should q turn out to be true then things are as p\nsays they are, and so we can hardly use q as evidence against\np. We return to Entailment below, but first we show how these\nthree principles are in conflict with CP.\n\nAssume, with Ampliativity, that a subject S is justified in\nbelieving a proposition h on the basis of some evidence\ne without having independent justification for believing any\nother proposition p such that p together with e\nentails h. Notice that h obviously entails h or\nnot-e. Therefore, by CP, S is justified in believing h\nor not-e. But, of course, e together with h or\nnot-e entails h. Therefore, if S is justified in\nbelieving h on the basis of e, then there is a\nproposition which S is justified in believing and which\ntogether with e entails h.\n\nNotice that this is close to, but not quite, the negation of\nAmpliativity. For Ampliativity denies that there will be any such\nproposition which S is independently justified in\nbelieving, and for all we have said S\u2019s justification for\nbelieving h or not-e is not independent. Independent of what?\nOf S\u2019s justification for believing h itself. For\nall we have said so far, S might be justified in believing\nh or not-e on the basis of h, or on the basis of\ne itself.\n\nBut, given Mere Lemmas, h cannot justify S in believing\nany proposition unless e does. Therefore, the only option left\nopen, short of denying Ampliativity, is to argue that e itself\njustifies S in believing h or not-e. But that is\nincompatible with Entailment. For notice that for e to justify\nS in believing h or not-e is for e to justify\nS in disbelieving its negation, i.e., e and not-h.\nBut, of course, e and not-h entails e, and so the\nentailment principle has it that e cannot justify S in\ndisbelieving e and not-h\u2014i.e., e cannot justify\nS in believing h or not-e.\n\nAlthough this particular reconstruction is our own (for more on it,\nsee Comesa\u00f1a forthcoming), some philosophers have taken\narguments similar to it to count against CP (see, for example, Huemer\n2001 and Sharon & Spectre 2017, and cf. Comesa\u00f1a 2017).\nHowever, others have argued against Entailment (see, for example,\nPryor 2014a,b and Vogel 2014b), and yet others have argued that denying Ampliativity\nitself is not as absurd as it might sound (Comesa\u00f1a 2014a,b).\nThe argument cannot, therefore, be taken to be a conclusive blow\nagainst CP.\n\nFinally, some epistemological theories are in conflict with\n CP.[10]\n Robert Nozick\u2019s account of knowledge is the best such example.\nRoughly his account is this (Nozick 1981: 172\u2013187):\n\nS knows that p iff:\n\n S believes p;\n p is true;\n if p were true, S would believe p;\n if p were not true, S would not believe\np.\n\n\nNozick called his account a \u201ctracking\u201d account of\nknowledge because whenever S knows that \\(p, S\\)\u2019s\nbeliefs track p. Think of a guided missile tracking\nits target. If the target were to move left, the missile would move\nleft. If the target were not to move left, the missile would not move\nleft. According to the tracking account of knowledge our beliefs must\ntrack the truth if we are to have knowledge.\n\nThere is one important clarification of conditions 3 and 4 that is\ndiscussed by Nozick, namely, that the method by which S\nacquires the belief must be held constant from the actual world to the\npossible world. A doting grandmother might know that her grandchild is\nnot a thief on the basis of sufficiently good evidence, but would\nstill believe that he wasn\u2019t a thief, even if he were, because\nshe loves him. So, we must require that the grandmother use the same\nmethod in both the actual and the near possible worlds, for,\notherwise, condition (4) would exclude some clear cases of knowledge.\nThis is not the place to provide a full examination of Nozick\u2019s\naccount of\n knowledge.[11]\n What is crucial for our discussion is that it is easy to see that, if\nNozick\u2019s account is correct, closure will fail for knowledge in\njust the kind of case that the Cartesian Skeptic is putting forward\nbecause of condition (4). Suppose S knows that there is a chair\nbefore her. Would she know that she is not in a skeptical scenario in\nwhich it merely appears that there is a chair? If the fourth condition\nwere a necessary condition of knowledge, she would not know that\nbecause if she were in such a scenario, she would be fooled into\nthinking that she wasn\u2019t. Thus, either condition (4) is too\nstrong or CP fails.\n\nThere are some reasons for thinking that condition (4) is too strong.\nConsider, for instance, this case in the literature: You put a glass\nof ice-cold lemonade on a picnic table in your backyard. You go inside\nand get a telephone call from a friend and talk for half an hour. When\nyou hang up you remember that you had left the ice-cold lemonade\noutside exposed to the hot sun and come to believe that it isn\u2019t\nice-cold anymore. It would seem that you could know that. Indeed, if\nit were false, that could only be due to some bizarre circumstance.\nThus, if the lemonade were still ice-cold, you would believe that it\nwasn\u2019t (see Vogel 1987: 206). The moral of this (and similar)\ncases seems to be that sensitivity is not a correct condition on\nknowledge.\n\nThere is much more to say about CP and CP1, but we will move on to\nconsidering the argument\u2019s other premise.\n3.2 Consideration of CP2\n\nCP2 claims that we are not justified in denying the skeptical\nhypothesis\u2014in other words, that we are not justified in\nbelieving that we are not being deceived. What arguments can be given\nfor CP2? It is tempting to suggest something like this: The skeptical\nscenarios are developed in such a way that it is assumed that we\ncould not tell that we were being deceived. For example, we\nare asked to consider that there is an Evil Genius \u201cso\npowerful\u201d that it could (1) make me believe that there were\nhands when there were none and (2) make it such that I could\nnot detect the illusion. But the skeptic must be very careful here.\nShe cannot require that in order for S to know (or be justified\nin believing) something, say x, that if x were false,\nshe would not still believe x. We have just seen (while\nexamining Nozick\u2019s account of knowledge) that this requirement\nis arguably too strong. So the mere fact that there could be skeptical\nscenarios in which S still believes that she is not in such a\nscenario cannot provide the skeptic with a basis for thinking that she\nfails to know that she is not (actually) in a skeptical scenario. But\neven more importantly, were that a requirement of knowledge (or\njustification), then we have seen that closure would fail and,\nconsequently, the basis for the first premise in the CP-style argument\nfor Cartesian Skepticism would be\n forfeited.[12]\n\n\nErnest Sosa has argued for three interrelated theses regarding CP2 and\nNozick\u2019s sensitivity condition: (i) that sensitivity can be\neasily confused with a different condition on knowledge (which Sosa\ncalls safety); (ii) that while sensitivity is not a correct necessary\ncondition on knowledge, safety is; (iii) finally, that our belief in\nthe negation of skeptical hypotheses is safe despite being\n insensitive.[13]\n\nNozick\u2019s sensitivity condition is a subjunctive\nconditional: if p were false, S would not believe\nit. The usual way in which such conditionals are evaluated is by\nassuming that there is an ordering of possible worlds\naccording to how much they resemble the actual world. A subjunctive\nconditional \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is true if and only if B is\ntrue in the closest (or all the closest) possible worlds where\nA is true. According to this semantics, subjunctive\nconditionals do not contrapose (the contrapositive of a conditional\nif A, B is if not-B, not-A). Thus, suppose that we\nflip a coin to decide whether you or I will strike this match: heads\nyou strike it, tails I do. The coin comes up head, you strike the\nmatch and it lights. In this situation, it is true that if I had\nstruck the match, it would have lit. But it doesn\u2019t seem to be\ntrue that if the match hadn\u2019t lit then I wouldn\u2019t have\nstruck it. The match might have failed to lit because it was wet while\neither of us struck it. In the possible worlds terminology, the\nclosest possible world where I strike the match is a world where it\nlights, but there are possible worlds where the match doesn\u2019t\nlight and I strike it that are as close to actuality as are worlds\nwhere the match doesn\u2019t light and you strike it.\n\nAfter noticing the failure of subjunctives to contrapose, Sosa\nproposed that we should replace Nozick\u2019s sensitivity condition\nwith its contrapositive, which Sosa calls a \u2018safety\u2019\ncondition. The following formulation seems to capture Sosa\u2019s\nintent:\n\n\nSafety: S\u2019s belief that p based\non e is safe if and only if S would not easily believe\nthat p based on e without it being so that p (in\nsymbols, S believes that p on basis \\(e \\rightarrow p\\)).\n(Sosa\n 2002)[14]\n\n\nNow, one initial worry about safety as a condition on knowledge is\nthat, given that belief and truth are also necessary for knowledge,\nsafety will always be (in this context) a true-true conditional (that\nis to say, both its antecedent and consequent will be true). This\nmeans that Sosa cannot accept the possible worlds semantics for\nsubjunctive conditionals briefly sketched above, at least if we assume\nthat every world is closer to itself than any other word. For when we\nhave a true-true conditional, the closest world where the antecedent\nis true will be the actual world, and so every such conditional will\nbe true (and, hence, any condition formulated by such conditionals\nwill be trivially\n satisfied).[15]\n Rather, Sosa understands the truth-conditions for the relevant\nconditions as requiring that the consequent be true in all nearby\npossible worlds where the antecedent is true.\n\nSosa\u2019s idea, then, is that we can explain away the temptation to\nthink that CP2 is true by noticing that although safety and\nsensitivity are easily confused with one another, my belief that I am\nnot the victim of a skeptical scenario is insensitive but safe, and\nthat whereas sensitivity is not a condition on knowledge, safety\nis.\n\nBut is safety a condition on knowledge? Several authors have thought\nthat, just as there are counterexamples to sensitivity, there are\ncounterexamples to safety as well. Here is one (taken from\nComesa\u00f1a 2005b):\n\n\nHalloween Party: There is a Halloween party at\nAndy\u2019s house, and I am invited. Andy\u2019s house is very\ndifficult to find, so he hires Judy to stand at a crossroads and\ndirect people towards the house (Judy\u2019s job is to tell people\nthat the party is at the house down the left road). Unbeknownst to me,\nAndy doesn\u2019t want Michael to go to the party, so he also tells\nJudy that if she sees Michael she should tell him the same thing she\ntells everybody else (that the party is at the house down the left\nroad), but she should immediately phone Andy so that the party can be\nmoved to Adam\u2019s house, which is down the right road. I seriously\nconsider disguising myself as Michael, but at the last moment I\ndon\u2019t. When I get to the crossroads, I ask Judy where the party\nis, and she tells me that it is down the left road.\n\n\nThat case is a counterexample to safety insofar as we agree that I\nknow that the party is at the house down the left road, and yet it\ncould very easily have happened that I have that same belief on the\nsame basis without it being so that the belief was true.\n\nSo far, we have argued that there are dangers in defending CP2 by\nappealing to the sensitivity condition, and that Sosa\u2019s attack\non CP2 might itself be subject to doubt. What else can be said for or\nagainst CP2?\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the rough idea that there is some kind of\nepistemic symmetry between what we take to be the actual case and a\nskeptical scenario. Of course, if we were the victims in a skeptical\nscenario, we wouldn\u2019t know that we are not (if only because it\nwould be false, but perhaps not only because of that). Given symmetry,\neven if we are not victims of a skeptical scenario, we do not know\nthat we are not. Moreover, we know all of this. As we suggested in\nsection 1, if we know that we don\u2019t know that p, then we\nare not even justified in believing that p. Therefore, CP2.\nEvery step in this argument can be challenged, but there is no doubt\nthat many philosophers find something along these lines at least worth\nthinking about. Let us take a closer look at the first step, the claim\nthat there is an epistemic symmetry between the good case and the\nskeptical scenario.\n\nWhat can this alleged symmetry amount to? One idea is that we have the\nsame evidence in both cases. According to a Cartesian account of this\ncommon evidence, it consists in mental states of the subject, such as\nher experiences. By construction, the subject has the same experiences\nin the skeptical scenario as she does in the good case. But some\nphilosophers, most notably Williamson 2000, have denied that we have\nthe same evidence in the good and the skeptical case. According to\nWilliamson, our evidence is constituted not by our experiences, but by\nwhat we know. Given that in the good case we know more propositions\nthat in the bad case, we have more evidence in the good case than we\ndo in the skeptical case. In the good case, for instance, we know\nmundane propositions such as the proposition that we have hands. Given\nthat knowledge entails justification, in the good case we are\njustified in believing that we have hands. Given CP, in the good case\nwe are justified in believing that we are not in the skeptical case.\nThis account of evidence entails that the relation of\nindiscriminability between the good case and the skeptical case is not\nsymmetric: victims of a skeptical scenario cannot distinguish the\nskeptical scenario from the good case (for all they know, they are in\nthe good case, and for all they know, they are in the skeptical case),\nbut subjects in the good case can distinguish between the cases (they\nknow that they are in the good case, and\u2014again, given\nCP\u2014they know that they are not in the skeptical\n case).[16]\n\nBut even those contemporary philosophers who grant that our epistemic\nposition with respect to external world propositions is the same in\nthe normal case as in the skeptical scenario can object to the\nsymmetry thesis. For even granting (as we must) that in the skeptical\nscenario we do not know that we are not in the skeptical scenario, it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that in the ordinary case we do not know that we\nare not in the skeptical scenario, not even assuming that we have the\nsame evidence in both cases. To begin with, an obvious difference\nbetween the normal case and the skeptical scenario is that in the\nskeptical scenario the proposition in question (that we are not in the\nskeptical scenario) is false, whereas in the normal case it is true.\nGiven that knowledge requires truth, we can explain why we lack\nknowledge in the skeptical scenario by appealing to this truth\ncondition on knowledge, rather than to the paucity of our evidence. In\nother words, our evidence for thinking that we are not in the\nskeptical scenario, this reply holds, is good enough to know that\nproposition, if only it were true. Now, the skeptic can then reply\nthat not all skeptical scenarios are such that external worlds\npropositions are false in them. For instance, if I am right now\ndreaming that I have hands I do not thereby know that I have hands,\neven though I do have hands while dreaming. We noted above that the\nintroduction of skeptical hypotheses which do not entail the falsity\nof external world propositions complicates the CP argument, but let us\nhere bracket that issue. For, in addition to truth, knowledge\nplausibly requires other non-evidential conditions. In the wake of the\nGettier problem, for instance, many philosophers have accepted that\nbesides belief, justification and truth, the right kind of relation\nbetween the truth of the proposition and the belief must hold, and\narguably it is this that fails in the dreaming scenario, rather than\n(again) the paucity of our evidence (see entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n Therefore, it can be held that there is an asymmetry between the good\ncase and the skeptical scenario even if we grant that we have the same\nevidence in both cases.\n\nThe Cartesian skeptic can nevertheless raise an uncomfortable question\nat this point: what is this alleged evidence in favor of the\nproposition that we are not in a skeptical scenario? One tempting\nanswer is that the evidence in question consists precisely of those\nexternal world propositions which are the target of the Cartesian\nargument. I know that I have hands, and, according to this view, that\nvery proposition is my evidence for the proposition that I am not a\nhandless brain in a vat. But recall our discussion of Dretske\u2019s\nmule case. There we pointed out that Dretske is, in effect,\nassimilating Closure and Transmission principles\u2014i.e., assuming\nthat the only way in which Closure principles can hold is if some\nevidence e is evidence both for p and any q\nentailed by p. We noted then that there is at least another\npossibility: it might be that we must be antecedently justified in\nbelieving q in order to be justified in believing some p\nwhich entails it. And indeed, it seems plausible that this is the\ndirection of the evidential relation between external world\npropositions and the negation of skeptical hypotheses: we cannot be\njustified in believing external world propositions unless we have\nantecedent justification for believing the negation of skeptical\nhypotheses (but cf. Pryor 2000).\n\nAnother alternative is to say that no evidence justifies us in\nbelieving the negations of skeptical hypotheses, but that we are\nnevertheless justified in believing them. On one version of this view,\nput forward by Crispin Wright 2004, our entitlement to\naccept that we are not in a skeptical scenario does not\ndepend on our having any kind of evidence, either empirical or a\npriori (see also Coliva (2015) for a development of a view in\nthis neighborhood). Indeed, we are entitled to accept those\npropositions because unless we were we would not be justified in\nbelieving any proposition. Notice two important\nterminological points in the statement of Wright\u2019s view: he\ndoesn\u2019t think that we are justified in believing that we are not\nin a skeptical scenario, but that we are entitled to accept that\nproposition. What are the differences between justification and\nentitlement, on the one hand, and belief and acceptance, on the other?\nRoughly, what we are calling justification Wright calls\n\u201cwarrant\u201d. He thinks that there are two kinds of warrant:\nwe can be warranted in believing a proposition because we have an\nevidential justification for it (where the evidence consists of the\npropositions we are warranted in believing or accepting), or we can be\nentitled to accept it even in the absence of any justification for\nthem. As for the difference between belief and acceptance, Wright is\nprepared to grant that to count as a belief an attitude must be\nevidence-based, and so entitlements cannot be entitlements to believe.\nTo be entitled to accept a proposition, for Wright, is to be justified\nin behaving (where \u201cbehavior\u201d is understood broadly, to\ninclude cognitive inferential behavior, for instance) approximately as\none would if one believed the proposition.\n\nOn another version of the view, although we do not have empirical\nevidence for the proposition that we are not in a skeptical scenario,\nwe do have a kind of justification for it which does not rest\nexclusively on the fact that if we didn\u2019t then we wouldn\u2019t\nbe justified in believing anything. Stewart Cohen 2010 has argued that\nour justification for believing that we are not in a skeptical\nscenario derives from the rationality of certain inferential rules\n(see also Wedgwood 2013). One such rule justifies us in concluding\n(defeasibly) that there is something red in front of us if we have an\nexperience with the content that there is something red in front of\nus. Now, we can use that rule \u201conline\u201d, when we do in fact\nhave an experience with the content that there is something red in\nfront of us, or \u201coffline\u201d, assuming for the sake of\nargument that we have an experience with the content that there is\nsomething red in front of us to see what follows from it. According to\nthe rule in question, it follows (again, defeasibly) that there is\nsomething red in front of us. We can now cancel the assumption by\nconcluding (defeasibly) with the following conditional: if I have an\nexperience with the content that there is something red in front of\nme, then there is something red in front of me. Notice that this\nconditional is incompatible with one specific skeptical hypothesis:\nthe hypothesis that (for whatever reason) I have an experience with\nthe content that there is something red in front of me but there is\nnothing red in front of me.\n4. Contextualism\n\nSo far, we have looked at reasons for and against the two premises of\nthe CP argument for Cartesian Skepticism. A different kind of approach\nto the argument requires some setup. Philosophers routinely\ndistinguish between sentences and the propositions\nexpressed by some of them. Sentences are language-dependent entities\nwhereas propositions are (something like) the informational content of\nsome of those language-dependent entities (see entry on\n propositions).\n Thus, we distinguish between the proposition that it is raining and\nthe English sentence It is raining. That very same\nproposition can be expressed by other sentences, such as the Spanish\nsentence Est\u00e1 lloviendo. Moreover, which proposition a\ngiven sentence expresses (if any) can depend on contextual\nfactors\u2014that is to say, the same sentence may express one\nproposition when produced in a given a context, and a different one\nwhen produced in a different context. Thus, when Tom\u00e1s says\nthat it is raining he expresses the proposition that it is raining in\nTucson on May 14, 2019, whereas when Manolo said \u201cEst\u00e1\nlloviendo\u201d last week, he expressed the proposition that it was\nraining in Mar del Plata on May 10, 2019.\n\nThe contextualist response to the argument for Cartesian Skepticism\nrests on the claim that which propositions the sentences used in that\nargument express is also a context-sensitive matter. Different\ncontextualists would fill in the details in different ways\u2014here\nwe follow most closely the contextualism of Cohen 1987, 1988, 2000,\n2005, 2014a,b, but see also Lewis 1996, DeRose 1992, 1995, 2002, 2004,\n2005 and Stine 1976. Notice, to begin with, that justification comes\nin degrees: one can be more justified in believing one proposition\nthan another. But there is also such a thing as being justified\ntout court. In this respect, it can be argued that\n\u201cjustified\u201d is like \u201ctall\u201d, in that we can\nmake sense both of comparative uses, such as when we say that\nTom\u00e1s is taller than his mother, and of non-comparative ones,\nsuch as when we say that Jordan is tall. Notice also that which\nproposition is expressed by a non-comparative use of\n\u201ctall\u201d does not float free from what would be appropriate\ncomparative uses. Thus, when I say \u201cJordan is tall\u201d, what\nI say is true provided that Jordan is taller than the average subject\nin the relevant contrast class. Thus, if Jordan is a fifth-grader,\nthen what I said would be true if Jordan is taller than the average\nfifth-grader, whereas if Jordan is an NBA player, then what I said\nwould be true if Jordan is taller than the average NBA player (who\nplays in Jordan\u2019s position, perhaps). Similarly, the\ncontextualist claims that when I say that I am justified in believing\na proposition, what I say is true if and only if my degree of\njustification for believing the proposition is higher than a\ncontextually set threshold. That threshold, moreover, can vary with\nthe conversational context. Thus, if we are doing epistemology and\nthinking about the requirements for justification, the threshold\nrequired for an utterance of \u201cI am justified in believing I have\nhands\u201d goes up to the point where few (if any) of us would count\nas having said something true, whereas in an everyday context the\nthreshold goes down to the point where most of us would count as\nhaving said something true.\n\nAccording to contextualism, then, there is no single proposition\nexpressed by the sentences used in the CP-based argument for Cartesian\nSkepticism. Rather, there are many such propositions. Two interesting\nones are the propositions expressed in everyday contexts, where CP2 as\nwell as the conclusion of the argument express false propositions, and\nthose expressed in heightened-scrutiny contexts, where both CP2 as\nwell as the conclusion of the argument express true propositions. CP1\n(as well as CP itself) always expresses a true proposition, as long as\nwe do not change contexts mid-sentence. Thus, the contextualist\nresponse to the CP-based argument is that it is at least two\narguments: a sound one, when produced in heightened-scrutiny contexts,\nand one with a false premise (and a false conclusion) when produced in\nordinary contexts. Contextualism is thus a more concessive response to\nthe skeptic than the ones we have canvassed so far, for it concedes\nthat the sentences used in the argument for Cartesian Skepticism can\nbe used to express propositions which constitute a sound argument.\n\nBut even though Contextualism represents a concessive answer to\nskepticism, it is certainly not concessive enough in the eyes of the\nskeptic. For the contextualist simply asserts that, in ordinary\ncontexts, we are justified in rejecting skeptical hypotheses. But\nrecall that the skeptic\u2019s idea was that CP2 is true even when we\nhave in mind even minimally demanding standards for justification. In\nother words, the skeptic claims that we are not justified in believing\nthe negation of skeptical hypotheses even a little bit, not just that\nwe do not meet a very stringent standard for justification. Now, the\nskeptic might well be wrong about this, but the contextualist, qua\ncontextualist, does not have any argument for his trademark claim that\nwe do have some justification for believing the negation of skeptical\nhypotheses. In this respect, contextualism as a response to the\nskeptic is parasitic on some independent argument to the effect that\nwe do have that kind of justification.\n\nA related issue regarding Contextualism pertains to its relevance to\nskepticism. Grant, if only for the sake of argument, that\nContextualism regarding knowledge and justification attributions is\ntrue. That is to say, grant that there are multiple properties that,\nsay, \u201cjustified\u201d could refer to. Couldn\u2019t skeptics,\nand epistemologists more generally, be interested in a subset (perhaps\njust one) of them? If so, the interesting epistemological arguments\nwould pertain to the conditions under which that property is\ninstantiated, and Contextualism would fall by the wayside. For a\ndebate regarding this and related issues, see Conee 2014a,b and Cohen\n2014a,b.\n\nA view which is related to, but crucially different from,\nContextualism goes under various names in the literature:\n\u201cSubject-Sensitive Invariantism\u201d, \u201cInterest Relative\nInvariantism\u201d or views which admit of \u201cpragmatic\nencroachment\u201d (see Fantl and McGrath 2002, 2007, 2009; Hawthorne\n2003; and Stanley 2005). Whereas the contextualist thinks that the\nsame sentence attributing justification can express different\npropositions depending on the context in which it is produced, the\nsubject-sensitive invariantist thinks that the proposition expressed\nis invariant, but its truth-value depends on features of the subject\nwhich can vary (such as how important it is to the subject that the\nbelief in question be true). Very roughly, a version of\nsubject-sensitive invariantism has it that a sentence of the form\n\u201cS is justified in believing p\u201d invariantly\nexpresses a proposition which entails that S\u2019s\njustification for believing p is at least high enough for\nS to be rational in acting as if p is true. Notice that\nwhether it is rational for S to act as if p is\ntraditionally thought to depend on two things: the degree of\njustification S has for believing that p (or, perhaps\nmore commonly in the context of decision theory, which degree of\nbelief, or credence, S is justified in assigning to p),\nand S\u2019s preferences. Thus, the more sensitive\nS\u2019s preferences are with respect to whether p is\ntrue, the more justified in believing p S must be for the\nproposition that S is justified (tout court) in\nbelieving p to be true. For instance, if nothing much hangs,\nfor S, on whether there is orange juice in the house, a faint\nmemory of having seen some in the fridge might be enough for it to be\ntrue that S is justified in believing that there is orange\njuice in the house. On the other hand, if S is diabetic and\nneeds to ingest some sugar quickly, that same faint memory might not\nbe enough for that same proposition to be true. Notice the difference\nbetween Contextualism and Subject-Sensitive Invariantism: the\ncontextualist might say that the same sentence (that S is\njustified in believing that there is orange juice in the house)\nexpresses two different propositions (one true, the other false)\ndepending on whether the conversational context includes the\ninformation that S is diabetic and needs to ingest sugar; the\nsubject-sensitive invariantist, on the other hand, holds that the\nsentence in question always expresses the same proposition, but that\nvery proposition is true in the first case but false in the\nsecond.\n\nSubject-Sensitive Invariantism has been subject to a number of\ncriticisms (see McGrath 2004; DeRose 2002, 2004, 2005; Cohen 2005;\nComesa\u00f1a 2013; Anderson and Hawthorne, 2019a,b), but the\ngeneral approach has also been ably defended (see the previously cited\nwork by Fantl and McGrath). Nevertheless, the same issue that arose\nwith respect to Contextualism seems to arise here. The\nSubject-Sensitive Invariantist needs an independent argument to the\neffect that we can be justified at least to a minimal degree in\nbelieving the negations of skeptical hypotheses, for otherwise his\ntrademark claim that propositions attributing us justification for\nbelieving such claims are true is itself unjustified.\n5. Pyrrhonian Skepticism\n\nWe turn now to Pyrrhonian\n Skepticism.[17]\n We remind the reader that our main interest here is not historical\n(for which see the entry on\n ancient skepticism),\n but rather systematic: we want to canvass the legacy of Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism for contemporary epistemology, and in so doing we set aside\neven the most cursory exegetical interest.\n\nRecall that, according to Pyrrhonian Skepticism, suspension of\njudgment is the only justified attitude with respect to any\nproposition (yes, including the proposition that suspension of\njudgment is the only justified attitude with respect to any\nproposition). We are interested here in whether there are good\narguments for such a view. We begin by recalling the tri-partite\ndistinction between belief, disbelief and suspension of judgment. If\nwe identify disbelief in a proposition with belief in its negation,\nthen we are left with two attitudes within the realm of coarse-grained\nepistemology: belief and suspension of judgment. We assume also that\nthe arguments to follow are addressed to someone who has an interest\nin, and has considered, the propositions in question. Otherwise, there\nis always the possibility of not taking any attitude whatsoever\ntowards a proposition. Such lack of an attitude cannot itself be\n(epistemically) justified or not. But if the subject is to take an\nattitude, then the argument for Pyrrhonian Skepticism has it that\nsuspension of judgment is the only justified one.\n\nThe Pyrrhonian skeptics sought suspension of judgment as a way of\nachieving calm (ataraxia) in the face of seemingly\nintractable disagreement. The Pyrrhonians had a number of ways, or\n\u201cmodes\u201d, to induce suspension of judgment. The importance\nof Pyrrhonian Skepticism to contemporary epistemology derives\nprimarily from these modes, and in particular from a subset of them\nreferred to collectively as \u201cthe modes of Agrippa\u201d. There\nare five modes associated with Agrippa, but three of them are the most\nimportant: the mode of hypothesis (or unsupported assertion), the mode\nof circularity (\u201creciprocal\u201d), and the mode of regression\nto infinity. The three modes of Agrippa function together in the\nfollowing way. Whenever the dogmatist (Sextus refers to those who are\nnot skeptics as \u201cdogmatists\u201d, and we will follow him in\nthis) asserts his belief in a proposition \\(p_1\\), the Pyrrhonian will\nchallenge that assertion, asking the dogmatist to justify \\(p_1\\), to\ngive reasons for thinking that it is true. The dogmatist will then\neither decline to answer the challenge or adduce another proposition\n\\(p_2\\) in support of \\(p_1\\). If the dogmatist refuses to answer the\nchallenge, the Pyrrhonian will be satisfied that the only justified\nattitude to take with respect to \\(p_1\\) is to suspend judgment,\nbecause no reason for it has been given (thus appealing to the mode of\nhypothesis). If the dogmatist adduces another proposition \\(p_2\\) in\nsupport of \\(p_1\\), then either \\(p_2\\) will be identical to \\(p_1\\)\nor it will be a different proposition. If \\(p_2\\) is the same\nproposition as \\(p_1\\), then the Pyrrhonian will also suspend judgment\nwith respect to \\(p_1\\), because no proposition can support itself\n(thus appealing to the mode of circularity). If, on the other hand,\n\\(p_2\\) is different from \\(p_1\\), then the Pyrrhonian will ask the\ndogmatist to justify his assertion of \\(p_2\\). And now either the\ndogmatist offers no reason in support of \\(p_2\\), or offers \\(p_2\\)\nitself or \\(p_1\\) as a reason, or adduces yet another proposition\n\\(p_3\\), different from both \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\). If the dogmatist\noffers no reason for \\(p_2\\), then the Pyrrhonian will invoke the mode\nof hypothesis again and suspend judgment in accordance with it; if\neither \\(p_2\\) itself or \\(p_1\\) are offered as reasons to believe in\n\\(p_1\\), then the Pyrrhonian will invoke the mode of circularity and\nsuspend judgment in accordance with it (because not only can no\nproposition be a reason for believing in itself, but also no genuine\nchain of reasons can loop); and, finally, if the dogmatist offers yet\nanother proposition \\(p_3\\), different from both \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\),\nas a reason to believe \\(p_2\\), then the same three possibilities that\narose with respect to \\(p_2\\) will arise with respect to \\(p_3\\). The\ndogmatist will not be able to continue offering different propositions\nin response to the Pyrrhonian challenge forever\u2014eventually,\neither no reason will be offered, or a proposition that has already\nmade an appearance will be mentioned again. The Pyrrhonian refers to\nthis impossibility of actually offering a different proposition each\ntime a reason is needed as \u201cthe mode of infinite\nregression\u201d. The three Pyrrhonian modes, then, work in tandem in\norder to induce suspension of judgment with respect to any proposition\nwhatsoever.\n\nThe Pyrrhonian use of the three modes of Agrippa in order to induce\nsuspension of judgment can be presented in the form of an argument,\nwhich has been called \u201cAgrippa\u2019s trilemma\u201d. It is at\nleast somewhat misleading to present the Pyrrhonian position in terms\nof an argument, because when someone presents an argument they are\nusually committed to the truth of its premises and its conclusion,\nwhereas Pyrrhonian skeptics would suspend judgment with respect to\nthem. Nevertheless, presenting an argument for Pyrrhonian Skepticism\ndoesn\u2019t do much violence to this skeptical position, because\nwhat is important is not whether the Pyrrhonians themselves accept the\npremises or the validity of the argument, but rather whether\nwe do. If we do, then it seems that we ourselves should be\nPyrrhonian skeptics (and if we do become Pyrrhonian skeptics as a\nresult of this argument, we can then start worrying about what to do\nwith respect to the fact that an argument whose premises we\nbelieved\u2014and perhaps still believe\u2014to be true convinced us\nthat we are not justified in believing anything). If we do not think\nthat the argument is sound, then we stand to learn something\ninteresting about the structure of an epistemological\ntheory\u2014because each of the premises of the apparently valid\nargument looks plausible at first sight.\n\nBefore presenting a reconstruction of Agrippa\u2019s trilemma we need\nto introduce some definitions. Let\u2019s say that a belief is\ninferentially justified if and only if it is justified (at\nleast in part) in virtue of its relations to other beliefs. A\njustified basic belief, by contrast, is a belief that is\njustified but not in virtue of its relations to other beliefs. An\ninferential chain is a set of beliefs such that every member\nof the set is allegedly related to at least one other member by the\nrelation \u201cis justified by\u201d. Agrippa\u2019s trilemma,\nthen, can be presented thus:\n\n\n If a belief is justified, then it is either a basic justified\nbelief or an inferentially justified belief.\n There are no basic justified beliefs.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n If a belief is justified, then it is justified in virtue of\nbelonging to an inferential chain.\n All inferential chains are such that either (a) they contain an\ninfinite number of beliefs; or (b) they contain circles; or (c) they\ncontain beliefs that are not justified.\n No belief is justified in virtue of belonging to an infinite\ninferential chain.\n No belief is justified in virtue of belonging to a circular\ninferential chain.\n No belief is justified in virtue of belonging to an inferential\nchain that contains unjustified beliefs.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n There are no justified beliefs.\n\n\n\nPremise 1 is beyond reproach, given our previous definitions. Premise\n2 is justified by the mode of hypothesis. Step 3 of the argument\nfollows from premises 1 and 2. Premise 4 is also beyond\nreproach\u2014the only remaining possible structure for an\ninferential chain to have is to contain basic justified beliefs, but\nthere are none of those according to premise 2. Premise 5 is justified\nby appeal to the mode of infinite regression, and premise 6 is\njustified by appeal to the mode of circularity. Premise 7 might seem\nto be a truism, but we will have to take a closer look at it.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Agrippa\u2019s trilemma is perfectly\ngeneral; in particular, it applies to philosophical positions as well\nas to ordinary propositions. In fact, when Agrippa\u2019s trilemma is\napplied to epistemological theories themselves, the result is what has\nbeen called \u201cthe problem of the criterion\u201d (see Chisholm\n1973).\n\nMany contemporary epistemological positions can be stated as a\nreaction to Agrippa\u2019s trilemma. In fact, all of premises 2, 5, 6\nand 7 have been rejected by different philosophers at one time or\nanother. We examine those responses in what follows.\n5.1 Rejecting Premise 2: Foundationalism\n\nFoundationalists claim that there are basic justified\nbeliefs\u2014beliefs that are justified but not in virtue of their\nrelations to other beliefs. In fact, according to foundationalism, all\njustified beliefs are either basic beliefs or are justified (at least\nin part) in virtue of being inferentially related to a justified\nbelief (or to some justified beliefs). This is where foundationalism\ngets its name: the edifice of justified beliefs has its foundation in\nbasic beliefs.\n\nBut how do foundationalists respond to the mode of hypothesis? If a\nbelief is not justified by another belief, then isn\u2019t it just a\nblind assertion? If basic beliefs are justified but not by other\nbeliefs, then how are they justified? What else besides\nbeliefs is there that can justify beliefs?\n\nTo this last question, many foundationalists reply: experience (we are\ntalking here about empirical knowledge; a priori knowledge\nraises interesting problems of its own, and it is of course also\nsubject to Agrippa\u2019s trilemma). To a rough first approximation\nthat glosses over many important philosophical issues, experiences are\nmental states that, like beliefs, aim to represent the world as it is,\nand, like beliefs too, can fail in achieving that aim\u2014that is,\nexperiences can misrepresent. Nevertheless, experiences are not to be\nidentified with beliefs, for it is possible to have an experience as\nof, e.g., facing two lines that differ in length without having the\nbelief that one is facing two lines that differ in length\u2014a\ncombination of mental states that anyone familiar with the\nM\u00fcller-Lyer illusion will recognize.\n\nThere are three important questions that any foundationalist has to\nanswer. First, what kinds of beliefs do experiences justify? Second,\nhow must inferentially acquired beliefs be related to basic beliefs in\norder for them to be justified? Third, in virtue of what do\nexperiences justify beliefs?\n\nWith respect to the first question, we can distinguish between\ntraditional foundationalism and moderate foundationalism. Traditional\nfoundationalists think that basic beliefs are beliefs about\nexperiences, whereas moderate foundationalists think that experience\ncan justify beliefs about the external world. Take, for example, the\nexperience that you typically have when looking at a tomato under good\nperceptual conditions\u2014an experience that, remember, can be had\neven if no tomato is actually\n there.[18]\n A moderate foundationalist would say that that experience justifies\nyou in believing that there is a tomato in front of you. The\ntraditional foundationalist, on the other hand, would say that the\nexperience justifies you only in believing that you have an experience\nas of a tomato in front of you. You may well be justified in believing\nthat there is a tomato in front of you, but only inferentially.\n\nA traditional argument in favor of traditional foundationalism relies\non the fact that whereas you can be mistaken regarding whether there\nis a tomato in front of you when you have an experience as of facing a\ntomato, you cannot, in the same situation, be mistaken regarding\nwhether you are undergoing such an experience. From the point of view\nof traditional foundationalism, this fact indicates that the moderate\nfoundationalist is taking an unnecessary epistemic risk\u2014the risk\nof having a foundation composed of false beliefs.\n\nThe moderate foundationalist can reply that the traditional\nfoundationalist must undertake a similar risk. For, while it is true\nthat if one is undergoing a certain experience then one cannot be\nmistaken in thinking that one is undergoing that experience, one can\nstill be mistaken about one\u2019s experiences\u2014for instance,\nperhaps one can believe that one is in pain even if the experience\nthat one is undergoing is actually one of feeling acutely\nuncomfortable. And if it were just as difficult to distinguish between\nthe true and the false in the realm of beliefs about our own\nexperiences as it is in the realm of beliefs about the external world,\nthen we could be wrong about which of our own beliefs are basically\njustified and which are not. If this kind of meta-fallibilism is\naccepted, then why not accept the further kind according to which\nbasic justified beliefs can be false? Of course, the resolution of\nthis dispute depends on whether, as the moderate believes, we can be\nmistaken about our own experiences.\n\nWhat about our second question: how must basic beliefs be related to\ninferentially justified beliefs? Here too there are two different\nkinds of foundationalism: deductivism and non-deductivism. According\nto the deductivist, the only way in which a (possibly one-membered)\nset of basic justified beliefs can justify another belief is by\nlogically entailing that other belief. In other words, there\nhas to be a valid argument at least some of whose premises\nare basic justified\n beliefs[19]\n and whose conclusion is the inferentially justified belief in\nquestion. Given that the argument is valid, the truth of the premises\nguarantees the truth of the conclusion\u2014it is impossible for all\nthe premises to be true while the conclusion is false. Non-deductivism\nallows relations other than logical entailment as possible\njustificatory relations. For instance, many foundationalists will\nclaim that good inductive inferences from basic justified\nbeliefs provide their conclusions with justification\u2014even though\ninductive arguments are not valid, that is, even though it is possible\nfor all the premises of a good inductive argument to be true while its\nconclusion is false. Although these are independent distinctions,\ntraditional foundationalists tend to be deductivists, whereas moderate\nfoundationalists tend to be non-deductivists. Notice that for a\ntraditional, deductivist foundationalist, there cannot be false\njustified beliefs. Many contemporary epistemologists would shy away\nfrom this strong form of infallibilism, and take that consequence to\nbe an argument against the conjunction of traditional foundationalism\nand deductivism.\n\nThe question that is most interesting from the point of view of\nPyrrhonian Skepticism is our third one: what is it about the relation\nbetween an experience and a belief that, according to the\nfoundationalist, allows the former to justify the latter? (Analogous\nquestions apply to non-foundationalist positions too, and the\ndiscussion to follow is not restricted to the specific case of\nfoundationalism.) There are three different proposals about how to\nanswer this question that are the most prominent. Let\u2019s call the\nprinciples that assert that a subject is justified in having a certain\nbelief given that she is undergoing a certain experience,\n\u201cepistemic principles\u201d. Our third question can then be\nstated as follows: what makes epistemic principles true?\n\nThe first proposal, which we shall call \u201cprimitivism\u201d,\nclaims that the question cannot have an intelligible answer. There is\nno more basic fact in virtue of which epistemic principles obtain.\nThey describe bedrock facts, not to be explained in terms of anything\nelse, but are instead to be used to explain other facts.\nEpistemological theorizing, according to the primitivist, ends with\nthe discovery of the correct epistemic principles (for views along\nthese lines, see Chisholm 1966 [and also the second and third\neditions: 1977, 1989] and Feldman & Conee 1985).\n\nThe other two positions are non-primitivist. Internalist\nnon-primitivism holds that epistemic principles are true in virtue of\nfacts about ourselves\u2014for instance, one prominent internalist\nview is that which epistemic principles are true for a given subject\nis determined by which epistemic principles that subject would accept\nunder deep reflection (see Foley\n 1993).[20]\nExternalist non-primitivism holds that epistemic principles\nare true in virtue of facts that are not about ourselves\u2014for\ninstance, one prominent externalist view is that certain experiences\nprovide justification for certain beliefs because the obtaining of\nthose experiences is reliably connected to the truth of those beliefs\n(that is, it couldn\u2019t easily happen that those experiences\nobtain without those beliefs being true; see Goldman 1979).\n\nBoth externalists and internalists think that primitivists are\noverlooking real facts, whereas primitivists think that there are\nfewer things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in non-primitivist\nphilosophy. Within the non-primitivist camp, externalists think that\ninternalists have too subjective a conception of epistemology\u2014to\nsome extent, thinking it so, or being disposed to think it so under\nconditions of deep reflection, makes it so for the internalist.\nInternalists, for their part, are likely to think that externalists\nare no longer engaged in the same project that both skeptics and\ninternalist epistemologists are engaged in, the project of determining\n\u201cfrom the inside\u201d whether one\u2019s beliefs are\njustified or amount to knowledge, because the obtaining of a relation\nbetween a belief of his and the external world is something that the\nsubject is in no position to ascertain \u201cfrom the\ninside\u201d.\n5.2 Rejecting Premise 5: Infinitism\n\nInfinitism, the claim that infinite evidential chains can provide\njustification to their members, is the answer to Agrippa\u2019s\ntrilemma that has received the least attention in the literature. This\nis due, at least in part, to the fact that infinitism has to deal with\nwhat might seem like formidable obstacles. For instance, it seems that\nno one actually has an infinite number of beliefs. To this objection,\nthe infinitist is likely to reply that actually occurring beliefs are\nnot needed, only implicit beliefs that are available to the subject in\norder to continue constructing his inferential chain if called upon to\ndo so (by others or by himself). The plausibility of this reply\ndepends on whether good sense can be made of the notion of implicit\nbelief and the notion of an implicit belief\u2019s being available\nfor a subject. A second apparently formidable problem for infinitism\nhas to do with the fact that the mere appeal to a new belief,\nregardless of its epistemic status, cannot provide justification to\nthe belief we started out with. In other words, infinitism seems to\nrun afoul of the following principle:\n\n\nPrinciple of inferential justification: If S\nis justified in believing p on the basis of S\u2019s\nbelief that q, then S is justified in believing\nq.\n\n\nThe infinitist might reply that he does not run afoul of that\nprinciple, because the beliefs adduced in support of the initial\nbeliefs are themselves justified by beliefs further down the chain.\nBut what goes for the initial set of beliefs goes, it seems, for\nlonger chains. If the appeal to a single unjustified belief cannot do\nany justificatory work of its own, why would appealing to a large\nnumber of unjustified beliefs do any better? Even leaving that problem\naside, the infinitist, like the coherentist, maintains that\njustification can arise merely in virtue of relations among beliefs.\nInfinitists will then have to respond to many of the same objections\nthat are leveled against coherentism\u2014in particular, they would\nhave to respond to the isolation objection mentioned in the next\nsection. (See Aikin 2011 and Klein 1999, 2007 for defenses of\ninfinitism; and see Turri & Klein 2014; Aikin & Peijnenburg\n2014; and Peijnenburg & Wenmackers 2014 for collections of essays\nwhich defend or criticize various forms of infinitism.)\n5.3 Rejecting Premise 3: Coherentism\n\nCoherentists reject two related features of the picture of evidential\nreasons that underlies Agrippa\u2019s trilemma. The first feature is\nthe idea that justification is an asymmetrical relation: if a\nbelief \\(p_1\\) justifies a different belief \\(p_2\\), then \\(p_2\\) does\nnot justify \\(p_1\\). The second feature is the idea that the unit of\njustification is the individual belief. Putting these two rejections\ntogether, the coherentist believes that justification is a symmetrical\nand holistic matter. It is not individual beliefs that are justified\nin the primary sense of the word, but only complete systems of\nbeliefs\u2014individual beliefs are justified, when they are, in\nvirtue of belonging to a justified system of beliefs. The central\ncoherentist notion of justification is best taken to be a comparative\none: a system of beliefs B1 is better justified than a system of\nbeliefs B2 if and only if B1 has a greater degree of internal\ncoherence than B2. One crucial question that coherentists have to\nanswer, of course, is what it takes for one system of beliefs to have\na greater degree of coherence than another. Many coherentists have\nthought that explanatory relations will be crucial in elucidating the\nnotion of coherence: the more explanatorily integrated a system is,\nthe more coherence it displays (see Quine & Ullian 1970 [1978] and\nBonJour 1978).\n\nThe main objection that coherentists have to answer has been called\n\u201cthe isolation objection\u201d. The objection centers on the\nfact that, according to the coherentist, the justification of a system\nof beliefs is entirely a matter of relations among the beliefs\nconstituting the system. But this runs against the strong intuition\nthat experience has a very important role to play in the justification\nof beliefs. To illustrate the problem, suppose that you and I both\nhave a highly coherent set of beliefs\u2014your system, it is safe to\nassume, contains the belief that you are reading, whereas mine\ndoesn\u2019t, and it contains instead the belief that I am swimming\n(because, let us suppose, I am swimming right now). Suppose now that\nwe switch systems of beliefs\u2014somehow, you come to have my set of\nbeliefs and I come to have yours. Given that coherence is entirely a\nmatter of relations among beliefs, your system will be as coherent in\nmy mind as it was in yours, and vice-versa. And yet, our beliefs are\nnow completely unjustified\u2014there you are, reading, believing\nthat you are swimming, and here I am, swimming, believing that I am\nreading. In other words, certain transformations that preserve\ncoherence in a system of beliefs do not seem to preserve\njustification.\n\nIn reply, coherentists have argued that it is possible to give\nexperience a role without sacrificing the idea that coherence is\nentirely a matter of relations among beliefs\u2014one idea is to\nrequire that any minimally acceptable system of beliefs contain\nbeliefs about the experiences that the subject is undergoing (see\nBonJour 1985 and Lehrer 1990). It is fair to say that there is no\nagreement regarding whether this move can solve the problem.\n5.4 Rejecting Premise 7: Positism\n\nOne position that can be traced back to some ideas in\nWittgenstein\u2019s On Certainty (Wittgenstein\n1969)\u2014and, perhaps, also to Ortega\u2019s Ideas y\nCreencias (Ortega y Gasset 1940)\u2014is that evidential chains\nhave to terminate in beliefs that are not properly said to be either\njustified or unjustified. This position, which we shall call\n\u201cPositism\u201d (not to be confused with\n\u201cpositivism\u201d), shares many features with Foundationalism:\nfor instance, both positists and foundationalists agree that\ninferential chains have to be finite and non-circular. But, whereas\nthe foundationalist thinks that the starting points of inferential\nchains are beliefs that are justified by something other than beliefs,\nthe positist thinks that the starting points of inferential chains are\nbeliefs that are not justified by anything\u2014they are posits that\nwe have to believe without justification. Despite this difference\nbetween the positist and the foundationalist, the positions are\nstructurally similar enough that analogues of the questions posed to\nthe foundationalist can be asked of the\n positist.[21]\n\nFirst, then, which beliefs are such that they are not justified and\nyet are the starting points of every inferential chain\u2014in other\nwords, how do we identify which are the posits? One answer that can be\ngleamed from Wittgenstein\u2019s On Certainty, which we will\ncall \u201crelativistic Positism\u201d, is that this is a matter\nthat is relative both to time and society, because what the posits are\nis determined by some function of the actual positing practices of the\nmembers of one\u2019s society at a certain time. Thus, according to\nWittgenstein, the proposition that no one has been to the moon was a\nposit for a certain long period of time\u2014it was a proposition\nthat no one felt the need to justify, and that was presupposed in many\njustificatory practices. For obvious reasons, though, that proposition\ncan no longer appropriately function as a posit. Other\nepistemologists, \u201cnon-relativistic positists\u201d, think that\nwhich beliefs are properly posited depends on some objective truth\nabout which beliefs have to be presupposed in order to engage in the\npractice of justifying beliefs at all. One prime candidate for playing\nthis role is the first-person belief that I am not being deceived by\nan evil demon into thinking that I am a normally embodied and situated\nhuman being (this is the view advocated by Wright 2004 that we already\nalluded to in section 3.2).\n\nThe second question, regarding how posits must be related to inferred\nbeliefs in order to justify them, can receive answers that are\ncompletely analogous to the foundationalists\u2019.\n\nThe third question, applied to positism, is the question why certain\nbeliefs are properly posited. Relativistic positists answer that this\nis so because of a certain societal fact: because they are taken to be\nso by an appropriate sub-sector of a certain society at a certain\ntime. Non-relativistic positists answer that a certain belief is\nproperly taken as a posit just in case every justificatory act that we\nengage in presupposes that the belief in question is true.\n\nOne objection that positists of both sorts have to face is that they\nare transforming a doxastic necessity into an epistemic\nvirtue\u2014that is, they are concluding that certain beliefs can\nproperly serve as the starting points of inferential chains because\nthat is how in fact they are treated (relativistic Positism) or\nbecause otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be possible to engage in\ninferential practices at all (non-relativistic Positism). The\nPyrrhonian skeptic, of course, will reply that the mere fact that most\nmembers of a society accept a certain belief without justification, or\neven the fact that if we don\u2019t do so then we cannot justify\nanything else, doesn\u2019t mean that it should be accepted without\njustification.\n5.5 Rejecting More than One Premise\n\nPerhaps the most interesting recent development in relation to\nPyrrhonian Skepticism is that more and more epistemologists are\narguing that the proper way to reply to Agrippa\u2019s trilemma is to\ncombine some of the positions that, for ease of exposition, we have\npresented as mutually exclusive. Thus, for example, many contemporary\nepistemologists put forward theories that contain elements of both\nFoundationalism and Coherentism (see, for instance, Haack 1993). It is\na testament to the endurance of Pyrrhonian Skepticism that\nphilosophers continue in this way to grapple with it.\n",
