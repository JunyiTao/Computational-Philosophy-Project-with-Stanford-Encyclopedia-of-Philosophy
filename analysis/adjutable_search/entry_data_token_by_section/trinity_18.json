    "main_text": "Four-self, No-self, and Indeterminate Self Theories || God as a Functional Person\n3.1 God as a Functional Person\n\nChad McIntosh (2015) formulates a Trinity theory which is similar to\nthree-self theories except that it adds God the Trinity as a fourth\ndivine self. This theory is inspired by recent work by philosophers on\ngroup persons. It\u2019s a longstanding part of legal tradition to\ntreat various kinds of non-persons, such as corporations, as\nif they were persons. This is particularly useful, e.g. in\nholding corporations responsible for damages they cause. But some\nphilosophers have argued for group agency realism, the thesis that\nsome groups of persons are themselves literal persons, with interests,\nknowledge, freedom, power to intentionally act, and moral\nresponsibility (168\u201371). McIntosh distinguishes\n\u201cintrinsicist\u201d persons, persons which are so because of\ntheir nature, from \u201cfunctional\u201d persons, persons which are\nso because of how they function. On this account the Persons\u00a0of\nthe Trinity are intrinsicist persons, while God the Trinity is a\nfunctional person (171).\n\nMcIntosh argues that since moral responsibility implies personhood (of\nsome kind), and it is clear that the Trinity must be praiseworthy,\ne.g. \u201cfor having achieved salvation for humankind\u201d or\n\u201cjust for having the character of a loving community\u201d,\nthen the Trinity must himself be a person. And it is widely agreed by\nChristians that the Trinity should be worshiped, but a non-person\ncan\u2019t be a fitting recipient of worship (173).\n\nOne may object that the Christian God is supposed to be a Trinity of\nPersons, not a Quaternity of Persons. As Leftow objects to another\ntheory,\n\n\u2026the very fact that the doctrine the Creed states is known as\nthat of the Trinity militates against calling a\nfour-[divine]-individuals view orthodox. Had the Creed-writers\nenvisioned God plus the Persons as adding up to four divine\nindividuals, surely the doctrine would have been called Quaternity\nfrom the beginning (Leftow 2018, 10).\n\n\nMcIntosh replies that the tradition demands that there are exactly\nthree Persons (Greek: hypostases) which share the divine\nnature or essence, which is captured by his claim that there are\nexactly three intrinsicist persons. This account does not\nclaim that God is a fourth hypostasis, a fourth intrinsicist person.\nRather, God is a functional person, a person not by his essence, but\nrather who exists as a person because of the unified functioning of\nthe Father, Son, and Spirit (174).\n\nMcIntosh argues that the theory neatly sidesteps a number of common\nobjections to three-self theories: here, God is a self and not merely\na group or a composite object which is less than a self. In contrast\nwith three-self theories, as a literal self, personal pronouns may be\nliterally used of him. And this group which is a \u201che\u201d can\nhave the divine attributes which imply being a self, such as\nomniscience and moral perfection. (See sections\n 2.4,\n 2.5.) It also, McIntosh argues, either falsifies or casts\ndoubt on the key premise in Tuggy\u2019s divine deception argument\nagainst three-self theories (175\u20137, 180; see section\n 2.3.)\n Following some Old Testament scholars, McIntosh claims that ancient\nIsraelites recognized many groups, including their own nation, as\nliteral (group, functional) persons. He argues that this belief\nexplains a number of oddities in the Old Testament, such as the idea\nof group guilt, apparent beings which seem in some sense to be\nextensions of Yahweh\u2019s personhood, and texts which switch easily\nbetween singular and plural subjects (177\u201380).\n",
