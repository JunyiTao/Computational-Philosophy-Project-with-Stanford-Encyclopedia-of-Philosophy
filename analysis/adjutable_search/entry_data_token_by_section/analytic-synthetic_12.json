    "main_text": "Post-Quinean Strategies || Neo-Cartesianism\n4.1 Neo-Cartesianism\n\nThe most unsympathetic response to Quine\u2019s challenges has been\nessentially to stare him down and insist upon an inner faculty of\n\u201cintuition\u201d whereby the truth of certain claims is simply\n\u201cgrasped\u201d directly through, as Bonjour (1998) puts it:\n\n\nan act of rational insight or rational intuition \u2026 [that] is\nseemingly (a) direct or immediate, nondiscursive, and yet also (b)\nintellectual or reason-governed \u2026 [It] depends upon nothing\nbeyond an understanding of the propositional content itself\u2026.\n(p. 102)\n\n\nBealer (1987, 1999) defends similar proposals. Neither Bonjour nor\nBealer are in fact particularly concerned to defend the analytic by\nsuch claims, but their recourse to mere understanding of propositional\ncontent is certainly what many defenders of the analytic have had in\nmind. Katz (1998, pp. 44\u20135), for example, explicitly made the\nvery same appeal to intuitions on behalf of the analytic claims\nsupported by his semantic theory. Somewhat more modestly, Peacocke\n(1992, 2004) claims that possession of certain logical concepts\nrequires that a person find certain inferences \u201cprimitively\ncompelling,\u201d or compelling not by reason of some inference that\ntakes \u201ctheir correctness\u2026as answerable to anything\nelse\u201d (1992, p. 6; see also his 2004, p. 100 and the other\nreferences in fn 9 above for the strategy, and fn 7, as well as\nHarman, 1996 [1999], and Horwich, 2000, for qualms).\n\nPerhaps the simplest reply along these lines emerges from a suggestion\nof David Lewis (1972 [1980]), who proposes to implicitly define, e.g.,\npsychological terms by conjoining the \u201cplatitudes\u201d in\nwhich they appear:\n\n\nInclude only platitudes that are common knowledge among us \u2013\neveryone knows them, everyone knows that everyone else knows them, and\nso on. For the meanings of our words are common knowledge, and I am\ngoing to claim that names of mental states derive their meaning from\nthese platitudes. (1972 [1980], p. 212)\n\n\nEnlarging on this idea, Frank Jackson (1998) emphasizes the role of\nintuitions about possible cases, as well as the need sometimes to\nmassage such intuitions so as to arrive at \u201cthe hypothesis that\nbest makes sense of [folk] responses\u201d (p. 36; see also pp.\n 34\u20135).[16]\n\nThe Quinean reply to all these approaches is, again, his main\nchallenge: how in the end are we to distinguish such claims of\n\u201crational insight,\u201d \u201cprimitive compulsion,\u201d\ninferential practices or folk beliefs, from merely some deeply\nentrenched empirical convictions, folk practices or, indeed, from mere\ndogmas? Isn\u2019t the history of thought littered with what have\nturned out to be deeply mistaken claims, inferences and platitudes\nthat people at the time have found \u201crationally\u201d and/or\n\u201cprimitively compelling,\u201d say, with regard to God, sin,\ndisease, biology, sexuality, or even patterns of reasoning themselves?\nAgain, consider the resistance Kahneman (2011) reports people\ndisplaying to correction of the fallacies they commit in a surprising\nrange of ordinary thought (cf. fn 7 above); or in a more disturbing\nvein, how the gifted mathematician, John Nash, claimed that his\ndelusional ideas \u201cabout supernatural beings came to me the same\nway that my mathematical ideas did\u201d (Nasar 1998, p. 11).\nIntrospected episodes, primitive compulsions, intuitions about\npossibilities, or even tacit folk theories alone are not going to\ndistinguish the analytic, since these all may be due as much to\npeople\u2019s (possibly mad!) empirical theories as to any special\nknowledge of meaning.\n\nA particularly vivid way to feel the force of Quine\u2019s challenge\nis afforded by a recent case that came before the Ontario Supreme\nCourt concerning whether laws that confined marriage to heterosexual\ncouples violated the equal protection clause of the constitution (see\nHalpern et al. 2001). The question was regarded as turning in\npart on the meaning of the word \u201cmarriage\u201d, and each party\nto the dispute solicited affidavits from philosophers, one of whom\nclaimed that the meaning of the word was tied to\nheterosexuality, another that it wasn\u2019t. Putting aside\nthe complex moral-political issues, Quine\u2019s challenge can be\nregarded as a reasonably sceptical request to know how any serious\ntheory of the world might settle it. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be\nsufficient merely to claim that marriage is/isn\u2019t necessarily\nheterosexual on the basis of common \u201cplatitudes,\u201d much\nless on \u201can act of rational insight [into] the propositional\ncontent itself\u201d; or because speakers found the inference from\nmarriage to heterosexuality \u201cprimitively compelling\u201d and\ncouldn\u2019t imagine gay people getting\n married![17]\n\nIndeed, some philosophers have offered some empirical evidence that\ncasts doubt on just how robust the data for the analytic might be. The\nmovement of \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d has pointed to\nevidence of considerable malleability of subject\u2019s\n\u201cintuitions\u201d with regard to the standard kinds of thought\nexperiments on which philosophical defenses of analytic claims\ntypically rely. Thus, Weinberg, Nichols and Stich (2001) found\nsignificant cultural differences between responses of Asian and\nWestern students regarding whether someone counted as having knowledge\nin a standard \u201cGettier\u201d (1963) example of accidental\njustified true belief; and Knobe (2003) found that\nnon-philosophers\u2019 judgments about whether an action is\nintentional depended on the (particularly negative) moral qualities of\nthe action, and not, as is presumed by most philosophers, on whether\nthe action was merely intended by the agent. Questions, of course,\ncould be raised about these experimental results (How well did the\nsubjects understand the project of assessing intuitions? Did the\nexperiments sufficiently control for the multitudinous\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d effects endemic to polling procedures? To what\nextent are the target terms merely polysemous \u2013 see\nsupplement, \u00a73\u2013 allowing for different uses in\ndifferent contexts?) However, the results do serve to show how the\ndetermination of meaning and analytic truths can be regarded as a far\nmore difficult empirical question than philosophers have traditionally\nsupposed (see Bishop and Trout, 2005, and Alexander and Weinberg,\n2007, for further discussion).\n",
