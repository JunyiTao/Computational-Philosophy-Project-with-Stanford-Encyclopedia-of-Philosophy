L. Mencken and Carl Jung\n\u2014 may or may not be fair to diplomats, but are surely correct in\nreminding us that more is involved in what one communicates than what\none literally says; more is involved in what one means than the\nstandard, conventional meaning of the words one uses. The words\n\u2018yes,\u2019 \u2018perhaps,\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 each\nhas a perfectly identifiable meaning, known by every speaker of\nEnglish (including not very competent ones). However, as those lines\nillustrate, it is possible for different speakers in different\ncircumstances to mean different things using those words. How is this\npossible? What\u2019s the relationship among the meaning of words,\nwhat speakers mean when uttering those words, the particular\ncircumstances of their utterance, their intentions, their actions, and\nwhat they manage to communicate? These are some of the questions that\npragmatics tries to answer; the sort of questions that, roughly\nspeaking, serve to characterize the field of pragmatics.\n",
