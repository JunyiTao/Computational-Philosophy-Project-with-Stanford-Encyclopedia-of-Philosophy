    "main_text": "\n\nMoral luck occurs when an agent can be correctly treated as an object\nof moral judgment despite the fact that a significant aspect of what\nshe is assessed for depends on factors beyond her control. Bernard\nWilliams writes, \u201cwhen I first introduced the expression\nmoral luck, I expected to suggest an oxymoron\u201d\n(Williams 1993, 251). Indeed, immunity from luck has been thought by\nmany to be part of the very essence of morality. And yet, as Williams\n(1976) and Thomas Nagel (1979) showed in their now classic pair of\narticles, it appears that our everyday judgments and practices commit\nus to the existence of moral luck. The problem of moral luck arises\nbecause we seem to be committed to the general principle that we are\nmorally assessable only to the extent that what we are assessed for\ndepends on factors under our control (call this the \u201cControl\nPrinciple\u201d). At the same time, when it comes to countless\nparticular cases, we morally assess agents for things that depend on\nfactors that are not in their control. And making the situation still\nmore problematic is the fact that a very natural line of reasoning\nsuggests that it is impossible to morally assess anyone for\nanything if we adhere to the Control Principle.\n",
