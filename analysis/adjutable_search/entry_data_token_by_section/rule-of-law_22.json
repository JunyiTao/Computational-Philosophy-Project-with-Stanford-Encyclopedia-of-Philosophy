    "main_text": "Controversies about Application || Development and Nation-Building\n8.6 Development and Nation-Building\n\nThe Rule of Law is often cited as the key to nation-building and to\nthe establishment of new democracies. Indeed it is often argued (e.g.,\nBarro 2000) that a new state needs Rule-of-Law\ninstitutions\u2014effective courts and commercial codes that can\nsecure property rights and the enforcement of contracts\u2014more\nthan or even before it needs democratic institutions such as an\nelected legislature. It is said that a legal system in a developing\ncountry dominated by legislative action will neither inspire the\nconfidence nor establish the stability that modern governance and\ninvestment require. (For discussion of these arguments, see Carothers\n1998 and\u2014more critically\u2014Carothers 2009.) This raises once\nmore the question of relation between the Rule of Law and\nlegislation\u2014only now it takes us also in the direction of\nconsidering an rather uncomfortably direct trade-off between Rule of\nLaw values and democracy.\n",
