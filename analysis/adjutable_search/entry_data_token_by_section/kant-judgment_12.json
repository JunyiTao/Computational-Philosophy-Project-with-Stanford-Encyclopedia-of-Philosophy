    "main_text": "Problems and Prospects || The top-down problem: judgment, transcendental affinity, and the systematic unity of nature\n4.2 The top-down problem: judgment, transcendental affinity, and the systematic unity of nature\n\nThe bottom-up problem has a metaphysical mirror-image, which can be\ncalled the top-down problem. This problem afflicts\nKant\u2019s transcendental doctrine of judgment, and consequently\nalso his theory of the principles of pure understanding (see the\nsupplement\n Completing the Picture of Kant\u2019s Metaphysics of Judgment).\n The worry here is simply that even allowing for the transcendental\nschematism of the judgment, there is still no absolute guarantee that\na given universal transcendental principle or transcendental concept\nof the understanding, construed as a rule for ordering sensory\nappearances or sensory objects, has been completely applied\nto sensory appearances or objects. In other words, even allowing for\nhis transcendental doctrine of the judgment, Kant has not given us\ngood reason to think that there cannot be any sensory appearances or\nobjects that fail to be subsumed under the transcendental principles\nof nature. In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant calls the\nspecifically causal-law-governed or nomological interconnection of all\nsensory appearances or objects under transcendental principles the\n\u201ctranscendental affinity\u201dof the sensory manifold of\nintuitions (A114). In the A edition of the first Critique, Kant\nasserts that if the categories are objectively valid, then the\ntranscendental affinity of the manifold automatically follows. Then,\nassuming the strongest version of transcendental idealism, he further\nasserts that from transcendental affinity, an \u201cempirical\naffinity\u201d of the sensory manifold of intuitions also directly\nfollows (A115). Now since empirical affinity is the complete\napplication to actual empirical nature of the system of causal laws\nunder transcendental principles, it follows that empirical affinity is\nthe same as the systematic unity of nature. So Kant is saying\nthat the systematic unity of nature is a trivial consequence of\ntranscendental affinity.\n\nIn the first Critique\u2019s Appendix to the Transcendental\nDialectic however, Kant quietly but very significantly backtracks on\nthis crucial point and treats the principle of the systematic unity of\nnature as stemming only from a regulative but not a\nconstitutive use of judgment, although this principle is also asserted\nto have some sort of transcendental force (see the supplement\n Kinds of Use).\n Then in the first Introduction to the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, Kant explicitly says that\n\n[it] is quite possible in itself (at least as far as the understanding\ncan make out a priori), [that] the multiplicity of these [empirical]\nlaws, along with the natural forms corresponding to them, being\ninfinitely great, [could] \u2026 present to us a raw chaotic\naggregate and not the least trace of a system, even though we must\npresuppose such a system in accordance with transcendental laws. (20:\n209)\n\n\nIn other words, now Kant is saying that the transcendental affinity of\nthe manifold does not entail an empirical affinity of the\nmanifold or the systematic unity of nature. To be sure, in the third\nCritique, he also explicitly ties together the principle of\nsystematic unity with the regulative use of reflective judgments of\ntaste, and says that it is a subjectively necessary transcendental\nprinciple presupposed by legitimate judgments of taste (see the\nsupplement\n Kinds of Use).\n But if the principle of systematic unity is only subjectively and not\nin fact objectively necessary, then Kant has not\nshown us that the system of causal laws of nature must be\ncompletely applied to sensory appearances or objects. Rather he has\nshown only that we must epistemically believe it to be\ncompletely applied to sensory appearances or objects. So there remains\nthe real possibility of relatively or absolutely chaotic aggregates of\nsensory appearances or objects that are not subsumed or even in\nprinciple cannot be subsumed under the transcendental affinity of the\nmanifold, i.e., the real possibility of the categorial anarchy of\nrogue objects. In other words, for all that Kant has argued, and by\nhis own reckoning, even assuming transcendental affinity there might\nstill be no complete application of transcendental laws to nature. So\nthe transcendental schematism of the pure concepts is insufficient to\nbridge the gap between categories and sensory appearances, and the\ntranscendental doctrine of judgment fails.\n",
