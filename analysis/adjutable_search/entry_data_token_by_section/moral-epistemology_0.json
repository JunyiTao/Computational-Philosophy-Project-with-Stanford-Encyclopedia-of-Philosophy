    "main_text": "Sociological: Moral Disagreement and Social Diversity\n1. Sociological: Moral Disagreement and Social Diversity\n\n\nPeople disagree about all kinds of things, from whether any milk is\nleft in the refrigerator to whether there is global warming. Some of\nthese disagreements are easily settled; others take a long time, even a\nhundred years or more, to reach resolution. Moral disagreement is no\nexception. That disagreement exists regarding moral questions is a\nsociological fact that is beyond question. Moral disagreements,\nhowever, appear to be particularly recalcitrant to resolution. Take the\nmorality of euthanasia or that of capital punishment. Each has been a\nsubject of moral disagreement for a long time. Moreover, it appears that people often\ndisagree even when they agree on non-moral facts. People can, for\nexample, disagree about whether capital punishment is ever morally\njustified, even when they agree that it has no general deterrence\nvalue, because one party believes it is a punishment that \u201cfits\u201d\ncertain crimes, no matter what its other consequences may be.\n\n\nIt would be a mistake to exaggerate the extent of moral\ndisagreement. There is considerable psychological and anthropological\nevidence that a small number of core moral values are espoused\nuniversally, such as: benevolence (avoiding harm to others and\noffering aid when the costs are not high); fairness (reciprocating\nhelp and sharing goods); loyalty (especially to family and community);\nrespect for authority (of one\u2019s parents and community leaders, when it\nis exercised responsibly); personal purity in body and mind (notably\nas it reflects moral character); and freedom (especially from\noppressive control by others). See Haidt 2012; Haidt & Joseph\n2004. Thus, when there is no conflict in moral values, as in Peter\nSinger\u2019s famous example of rescuing a toddler from drowning in a\nshallow pond by wading into it and ruining one\u2019s new suit, there is\nuniversal agreement about what a person ought to do across all\ncultures (Singer 1972).\n\n\nNevertheless, these values are often interpreted and applied\ndifferently not only across cultures but also across time within\nroughly the same cultures. For instance, until recently the dominant\nview in the United States and Europe has been that homosexuality is a\nmorally impure state but now the dominant view is that gay sex is not\ninherently morally impure or unacceptable. What accounts for this\nchange? Moreover, the core moral values can conflict, as when loyalty\nto family or religious authority demands that one not show benevolence\ntoward a despised outsider. What if the toddler to be rescued is from\nthe wrong tribe? Or take the extreme divide separating the politically\nleft and right over issues of freedom and fairness. Though each side\nespouses the core values listed, they interpret them differently and\ngive them different priorities in cases of moral conflict. It is far\nfrom clear how these kinds of moral disputes can ever be resolved.\n\n\nThese considerations lead to the following worry. If it is a\nsociological fact that moral disagreements are generally more\nrecalcitrant to resolution than disputes which do not involve\ndifferences about moral value \u2014 as I will assume for the sake of\nargument \u2014 what explains this fact? A possible explanation is that\nthere is no fact of the matter about whether the practice in question\nis morally right. People agree or disagree in their moral attitudes,\nbut there are no moral truths about which they can be mistaken. Hence,\nnothing about which they have conflicting attitudes is or can be a\nproper object of knowledge. In short, moral disagreements often resist\nresolution, however intelligent, informed, and respectful the\ndisputants may be, because moral knowledge is impossible.\n\n\nThe style of argument here is that of inference to the best\nexplanation (Harman 1965). Even if the sociological premise is granted,\nthe conclusion is not guaranteed to be true. Rather we have reason to\nbelieve the conclusion, assuming the premise is true, provided that no\nother explanation better accounts for the truth of the premise. This\nstyle of argument can be successful when no other explanation can\naccount for the truth of the premise. It may seem, however, that there\nare plausible alternative explanations that are compatible with the\npossibility of moral knowledge. Two main kinds of explanation are\nparticularly salient.\n\n\nOne explanation arises from cases of moral disagreement where the\nprospects of resolution appear most remote. When the disputants are\nfrom different cultures and their disagreement reflects a divergence in\nvalues between the cultures in which the disputants were raised, there\nmay appear to be insufficient common ground on which to effect a\nresolution. A moral relativist can explain this commonplace observation\nwith a theory of moral knowledge. A moral relativist can say that the\nlack of resolution is to be explained by the fact that the moral\nknowledge expressed by each disputant is relative to the culture in\nwhich the person learned his or her values. Thus, when someone from a\nculture in which women must veil their faces in public defends this\npractice as morally appropriate and indeed required, the relativist\nwould interpret the defense as expressing knowledge of what is\nacceptable and not acceptable in his or her culture. Similarly, when\nthe person coming from a culture in which the practice is not\nappropriate or required disagrees, he or she is simply expressing\nknowledge of what is acceptable morally in his or her culture. Each has\nmoral knowledge, despite the clash in their opinions, but their\nknowledge has to be understood relative to the culture in which the\nknowledge has its roots.\n\n\nThe brief description of moral relativism just given belies the\nimmense variety of forms in which it can be stated. Moral relativism\ncan be formulated to take account of differences in moral outlook\nbetween different people within the same society to explain the\ndifficulty of reaching resolution when the general culture of the\ndisputants is the same. It can also be formulated to avoid reference\nto an overarching non-relative moral claim and to allow criticism of\none\u2019s own culture. (See Harman 1975, 1978, and 1985; Lyons 1976; Wong\n1984; Wiggins 1988; Sayre-McCord 1991; Braybrooke et\nal. 1995; Copp 1995.)  Nevertheless, can any view that makes\nmoral truth relative to culture or personal point of view save the\npossibility of moral knowledge? An objection to relativism made famous\nby G. E. Moore is telling in the present context (Moore 1912). If the\nmeaning of the claims were as described, so that each disputant would\nbe saying something true or possibly true of his or her own culture\n(or point of view), there would be the notable logical consequence\nthat they would not be disagreeing with each other. Rather they would\nbe talking about different things.  Moore takes it to be obvious that\nreal disputants would be disagreeing, since each claim should be taken\nto be the contradictory of the other.  Hence, since relativism implies\nthat no moral disagreement exists in this case, he rejects moral\nrelativism as being unable to account for the fact of moral\ndisagreement.\n\n\nAs a general objection to moral relativism, the objection is\nunsuccessful, since it is possible to formulate moral relativism\nwithout the assumption that moral judgments express true or false\nclaims. Thus, Charles Stevenson, who takes them to be expressions of\nattitude, holds that people can disagree in attitude even if their\nmoral views have no truth-value and cannot be logically inconsistent in\nthe sense that Moore intended (Stevenson 1944 and 1963). The objection\nis successful, however, against the attempt to save the possibility of\nmoral knowledge by interpreting the moral claims as being true or false\nclaims about different cultures or points of view. If each disputant,\nin taking issue with the other, is disagreeing about what is true, then\nthe disputants cannot be making claims about different things and hence\ncannot have knowledge of the kind the moral relativist supposes. If\nthey did, neither could be disagreeing about the truth of the other\u2019s\nmoral claim. In the next section we will return to the position that\nmoral claims are merely expressions of attitude, a position consistent\nwith the fact of moral disagreement. For now we should concede that\nmoral relativism does not offer a satisfactory explanation of how moral\nknowledge is possible in cases of radical moral disagreement between\npeople of different cultures of subcultures.\n\n\nIs there another way we might explain the fact of moral disagreement\nwithout conceding the impossibility of moral knowledge? Any theory\nthat implies that moral knowledge is possible must face this question,\nbut in general a range of considerations is available that might\nprovide an alternative explanation depending on the nature of the\ndisagreement.  They divide into three kinds: (a) disagreements about\nnon-moral facts, (b) factors that distort judgment, and (c)\ndisagreements about certain complex empirical facts that are also\nmoral facts. In the first category are disagreements about religious\nfacts, such as whether God exists. We will consider below the\nrelevance of theology to moral epistemology. For the present it is\nsufficient to note that people with deep moral disagreements, say\nregarding abortion, euthanasia, and capital punishment, may have\ndifferent religious views. To the extent that these can be considered\nnon-moral views, for example, that God\u2019s will is unambiguously\nexpressed in the Bible, these differences may be able to explain the\nmoral disagreement. Moreover, if it is possible to know whether these\nnon-moral views are true, then we may be able explain moral\ndisagreement without conceding the impossibility of moral\nknowledge. Other kinds of disagreements also fall into category (a).\nPeople with different moral outlooks frequently disagree about the\npsychological nature of humans and other animals or about large-scale\neconomic and social theories relevant to assessing the consequences of\neconomic and social policy. Disagreements about these difficult\nnon-moral questions, assuming that these are issues about which\nobjective knowledge is possible, could explain the absence of moral\nagreement. Unless these explanations can be eliminated, the inference\nfrom persistent moral disagreement to the impossibility of moral\nknowledge is on shaky ground. In category (b) we can place such things\nas having personal bias because of the implications of the issue at\nhand, being in the grip of a social ideology, and feeling abnormally\ndepressed or fearful. A person, for example, who faces the death\npenalty for a crime, or someone who has strong feelings of vengeance,\nmay not be able to form an objective view of the morality of capital\npunishment. Again we have a possible alternative way to explain moral\ndisagreement. Finally, in category (c), if moral facts are extremely\ncomplex empirical facts (see the discussion of moral naturalism\nbelow), it is possible for moral disagreement to persist for the same\nreason that disagreement over complex scientific questions can\npersist.(For further discussion regarding moral disagreement see\nMiller 1992. For recent empirical work suggesting that moral\ndisagreement cannot be explained away by one of the above means, see\nDoris and Plakias 2008.)\n\n\nAlthough the possibility of these alternative explanations does not\nestablish that moral knowledge is possible, anyone arguing to the\nopposite conclusion by inference to the best explanation needs to make\na plausible case that they can all be eliminated. Moreover, as\ndefenders of moral knowledge point out, unless such a case is made out,\nthe default position should be that we know some moral truths.\nDefenders note that moral language is formulated as if moral claims can\nbe true and that we worry about whether to believe certain moral claims\njust as if truth is at stake. When challenged we appeal to evidence\njust as we do in the instance of straightforwardly factual claims, and\nwe make logical inferences that conform to logical systems based on\nclaims having truth-values. Though these points are not decisive, they\nunderline the importance of eliminating alternative explanations of\nmoral disagreement before concluding that moral knowledge is\nimpossible.\n",
