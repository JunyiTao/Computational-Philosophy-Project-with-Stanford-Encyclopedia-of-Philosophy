    "main_text": "The Morality of Procreation || Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n3.2 Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n\nSuppose that competent adults have the liberty to procreate. Are there\nlimits on the means that they may take in order to do so? In this and\nthe following section we focus on three methods of ART that have\ngenerated controversy: gamete donation, in vitro fertilization (IVF),\nand commercial surrogacy. (Here we focus on technologies already\nwidely used; for a discussion of reproductive human cloning, see the\nentry on\n cloning.)\n\nMost discussion has centered on whether it is permissible for\nprospective parents to avail themselves of these novel technologies\nfor procreation. There has also been some debate over whether people\nhave a claim to access these technologies through public health care\nsystems or private health insurance. Most rich countries with\nuniversal health care provide some treatment for infertility. For\nexample, the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service funds a\nlimited number of cycles of IVF for couples who meet eligibility\ncriteria. Given limited resources, providing ART takes away from money\nthat could be spent on other health care interventions (Roberts 1997).\nIn this context it is particularly important whether infertility is\nproperly considered a disease or disability in need of treatment\n(Neumann 1997; McLeod 2017). Another broad social concern raised by\nall these technologies is their role in the reproduction of race; when\nsuch technologies are used to produce racially similar children, they\nmay perpetuate the idea of race as natural, as opposed to a social\nconstruction (Russell 2018).\n\nGamete donation involves the provision of gametes by a man or woman\nwho is not intended to be the resulting child\u2019s social parent.\nInsemination by another man is not a new technology per se, but the\nmodern phenomena of sperm banking and anonymous providers have led\nsome to question the morality of artificial insemination by donor\n(AID). Some objections clearly have a religious basis; we therefore do\nnot discuss them here. But some conservatives about procreative\nliberty have also developed secular objections to gamete donation. The\nmost interesting of these focuses on the practice of paying gamete\nproviders. For example, Thomas Murray criticizes \u201cinsemination\nby vendor\u201d on the grounds that it inserts the values of the\nmarketplace into family life and thereby threatens to undermine it\n(Murray 1996, 34). The process of harvesting ova also involves serious\nrisks to the woman providing them, which are discussed in the\ndescription of the IVF process below.\n\nA different set of concerns centers on the moral responsibilities of\ngamete providers. Since in most jurisdictions gamete providers must\nwaive all parental claims over their genetic offspring, it has been\nwidely assumed that they do not have moral parental responsibilities.\nSeveral philosophers have, however, argued that gamete donation is\nmorally dubious, precisely because providers take their parental\nresponsibilities too lightly (Benatar 1999; Nelson 1991; Moschella\n2014). The argument can be challenged in at least two ways. First, we\nmight challenge the claim that gamete providers typically treat their\nparental responsibilities too lightly by transferring or alienating\nthem (Bayne 2003, Page 1985), especially in the case when gamete\ndonation occurs in a context in which assisted reproduction is\nregulated and would-be gamete recipients are screened. Second, one\ncould argue that in the broad nexus of persons responsible for\ncreating a child through assisted reproduction, the contribution of\ngamete providers is not especially morally significant (Fuscaldo\n2006). (See the entry on\n gamete donation and sale.)\n However, recent critics have argued that gamete donors morally cannot\ntransfer or alienate their parental responsibilities because these\ninvolve maintaining particular relationships which cannot be\ntransferred (Weinberg 2016; see also Brandt 2017).\n\nA distinct debate concerns the permissibility of procreating using\nanonymous gamete donors. Velleman argues that this practice is wrong\nbecause it frustrates children\u2019s interest in knowing their\ngenetic forebears (Velleman 2005). In response, Haslanger argues that\nnot only does this view make certain forms of adoption morally\nsuspect, it presupposes implausible connections between genetics,\nidentity, and human flourishing (Haslanger 2009). Policy debates over\nanonymous gamete donation have expanded to the question of whether\ndonor-conceived individuals\u2014as adults\u2014have the right to\nknow who their genetic parents are (Melo\u2010Mart\u00edn 2014;\nGroll 2020). Anonymous donation is now illegal in a number of\njurisdictions.\n\nIVF involves fertilizing ova outside the womb and transferring\nresulting embryos into the uterus. The woman whose ova are used is\ngiven a hormone treatment that induces producing multiple ova, which\nare harvested by a needle inserted through the vaginal wall.\nFertilization may involve incubating the ovum in sperm or injecting a\nsingle sperm into the ovum in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).\nSeveral embryos are transferred into the uterus after three to five\ndays. Since the birth of the first \u201ctest-tube baby\u201d in\n1978, IVF has become a fairly common procedure for addressing certain\nforms of infertility.\n\nObjections to IVF have focused on negative consequences for the women\nor their offspring and on wider societal implications. Stimulation of\nthe ovaries may lead to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a\npotentially serious condition. Like any surgical procedure there are\nrisks involved in retrieval of ova. Transferring multiple embryos\nincreases risk of multiple pregnancy, which can be risky for both\nmother and fetuses. Fetuses born as a result of IVF may be at an\nincreased risk of birth defects, lower birth weights, and premature\nbirth (Bower and Hansen 2005; Reefhuis et al. 2009). The absolute risk\nof these problems remains relatively low, however, and so they do not\nseem to justify a blanket prohibition on IVF.\n\nSimilar objections to those raised against gamete donation have also\nbeen raised against IVF, including that it commodifies children and\nfemale reproduction. Feminists have developed a more subtle critique.\nSherwin (1987) argues that the powerful desires that many people,\nespecially women, have for their own biological children are the\nproduct of problematic social arrangements and cultural values. While\nreproductive technologies like IVF may help some (privileged) women\nget what they want, they also further entrench the oppressive societal\nvalues that create these powerful desires in the first place.\n\nIVF typically results in creating more embryos than are used in the\nfertility treatment. The remaining embryos may be given to other women\nfor implantation, donated for research, destroyed, or cryogenically\nstored. There are likely over a million cryogenically stored embryos\nin the United States alone (Christianson et al. 2020). Depending on\none\u2019s view of the moral importance of human embryos this may be\nconsidered an especially worrying consequence of IVF. People who\nbelieve that such embryos have the same moral status as humans will\njudge that destroying them is wrong and creating them without a plan\nfor implantation is comparably bad. The use of surplus embryos as a\nsource of totipotent stem cells for medical research has generated\nobjections from religious groups and conservatives opposed to\nabortion. Consistency would seem to require that anyone who objects to\nusing these embryos in research ought also to object to their creation\nin the first place, since it almost inevitably results in surplus\nembryos that will eventually be destroyed.\n",
