    "main_text": "Metaphysical Sentimentalism || Ideal Dispositionalism\n4.2 Ideal Dispositionalism\n\nParalleling the case of moral judgment, problems with Simple\nSubjectivism motivate a move to Ideal Dispositionalism. According to\nthis type of view, the extension of moral or evaluative properties is\ndetermined by the sentimental responses of idealized subjects of some\nsort, or responses under idealized conditions. Consequently, the\nMissing Fallibility Problem is handily skirted: we can no doubt be\nmistaken about what an ideal observer would approve.\n\nIdeal Dispositionalist views also avoid the Missing Rigidity Problem.\nDepending on the details, it may suffice to idealize the subject of\nthe sentiments: maybe no impartial spectator would approve of slavery,\neven if the majority of people were to have a pro-slavery sensibility.\nIn case the idealization process is path-dependent (so that the\noutcome depends on the unidealized initial sentiments of the subject),\nIdeal Dispositionalists may make a rigidification move (Wiggins 1987:\n206). They can say that the starting point for idealization is\nconstituted by actually normal sentiments, which include a\nstrong desire not to be at the mercy of the good will of others, among\nothers. Thus, rigidified ideal observers would disapprove of slavery,\neven if it became statistically normal to approve of it. Peter Railton\n(2003) objects to rigidification, because for him what is\nintrinsically good or bad for someone is relational,\ndependent on the match between their responses and their objects, much\nas sweetness and bitterness are. Changes in people\u2019s\nsensibilities would change what\u2019s good (or sweet) for\nthem. Still, something like cruelty wouldn\u2019t become right even\nif it were generally approved of, since for Railton, its wrongness\nhangs on badness of its consequences rather than our disapproval of\nit, and pain that people are averse to would still be bad for\nthem.\n\nIdeal Dispositionalism comes in several varieties, which often\ncorrespond to views about the content of moral judgment (Firth 1952;\nLewis 1989; Smith 1994). Even if they avoid problems with fallibility\nand rigidity, there are a number of further challenges. Four will be\ndiscussed here.\n\nFirst, the Euthyphro Dilemma derives its name from the Platonic\ndialogue in which Socrates argues against a version of Divine Command\ntheory. Applied to ideal dispositionalism, it can be presented as\nfollows:\n\nA subjectivist theory defines the subject whose responses\ndetermine the extension of evaluative properties either in evaluative\nterms, whose application presupposes mind-independent evaluative\ntruths, or in non-evaluative terms.\nIf the subject is defined in evaluative terms, the theory\ncollapses into mind-independent realism: it presupposes the existence\nof at least some mind-independent evaluative truths.\nIf the subject is defined in non-evaluative terms, her responses\nwill be morally arbitrary and lacking in authority to determine the\nextension of evaluative properties.\nSo, a subjectivist theory is either self-defeating (because of\ncollapse into realism) or false (because of yielding arbitrary\nextensions for moral properties).\n\n\nIt is clear that subjectivist accounts with any kind of reductive\nambition cannot embrace the first horn of the dilemma (see below for\nnon-reductivist accounts). So it is the second horn that they must\nface. What exactly is the problem with it? According to Russ\nShafer-Landau, it is that\n\n\nit may be impossible to craft a set of [non-evaluative] constraints on\nattitude formation such that the emerging attitudes yield\nprescriptions that match up with our views about what constitutes\nparadigmatically moral and immoral behaviour (Shafer-Landau 2003:\n41)\n\n\nThe challenge is that ideal observers, when defined in non-evaluative\nterms, might approve of bad things, like ethnic cleansing, which would\ncounterintuitively entail that ethnic cleansing would be morally\nright. However, Shafer-Landau admits that there is no knock-down\nargument to the effect that any idealization in non-evaluative terms\nwill yield counterintuitive results.\n\nPerhaps the real challenge that the Euthyphro poses concerns the\nnormative authority of the responses of any kind of\nsubject defined in non-evaluative terms. One way to develop this\nchallenge may be called the Missing Normativity Problem. Many\nbelieve that moral rightness or wrongness are categorically\nreason-giving features of actions. Everyone, regardless of their\ninterests and desires, has a reason to refrain from morally wrong\nbehaviour. Suppose, then, that to be wrong is to be such as to be\ndisapproved of by any ideal observer. On a reductivist view, this is a\nnatural property of the action, specified in non-normative terms. The\nchallenge is: why would such a natural property be categorically\nreason-giving? Why should people care about doing only things that\nwould not be disapproved of by a hypothetical spectator?\n\nAs Mark Johnston puts it,\n\n\nTo say that something would be valued under condition K is\nnot thereby to commend it, but only to make a descriptive remark about\nits relation to certain psychological conditions. (Johnston 1989: 157;\ncf. Blackburn 1993: 274)\n\n\nThese challenges may be ways of spelling out the force of G. E.\nMoore\u2019s (1903) famous Open Question Argument: since it makes\nsense to grant that some X would be disapproved of by any\nimpartial, informed, but otherwise normal observer, but nevertheless\ndeny that X is morally wrong, there is reason to think that\nbeing disapproved of by an ideal observer is not the same thing as\nbeing morally wrong. To be sure, the Open Question Argument is\ncontentious, and there are a number of standard responses: perhaps the\nidentity of the properties is a posteriori, like that of\nwater and H2O (Brink 1989), or perhaps it is an unobvious\nconceptual truth that we can read off the platitudes surrounding our\nconcepts (Smith 1994). (See the entry on\n moral naturalism.)\n\nThe third issue is the Indeterminacy Problem. Given a characterisation\nof an ideal observer, is there really such a thing as an action that\nwould be approved of by any ideal observer, given divergence\nin pre-idealization attitudes? (Brandt 1955: 408) If ideal observers\ndisagree, there is, according to the theory, no fact of the matter.\nThis problem derives from an essential feature of idealized\ndispositional theories: the idealization begins from what people are\nactually like, and the process may not guarantee convergence in the\nrelevant respects.\n\nFinally, the Unmotivated Idealization Problem is that it is not\nobvious that the move from actual responses or dispositions to ideal\ndispositions has a rationale that is consistent with the core ideas of\nresponse-dependence theory. David Enoch (2005) has recently made a\nforceful case for this problem. He notes that if there are\nresponse-independent facts, it makes good sense to privilege responses\nof certain kind of subjects in certain conditions, because such\nfeatures of subjects and conditions are conducive to tracking the\nresponse-independent facts. But that option is obviously closed for\nthe ideal dispositionalist.\n\nEnoch claims that there is no real alternative rationale that is not\nad hoc or that doesn\u2019t tacitly rely on response-independent\nrealism. For example, appealing to our actual justificatory practice,\nin which we may privilege responses under full imaginative\nacquaintance, for example, is not an option, since that practice is\nitself best explained by the underlying assumption that there are\nmind-independent moral facts (Enoch 2005: 774). However, Hume might\nobject that the rationale for stepping back from our actual\nsentimental responses is avoiding \u201ccontinual contradictions in\nsociety and conversation\u201d and other practical problems\n (see Section 2.2).\n If this is right, our actual justificatory practice and the\nprivileged place it gives to reflectively corrected responses thus has\nan explanation and rationale that do not presuppose mind-independent\nevaluative facts. In this vein, Kauppinen (2014b, 580) holds that\n\u201cAn evaluative perspective is ideal or optimal when adopting it\nmost reliably avoids the practical problems caused by the uncorrected\nattitudes\u201d.
