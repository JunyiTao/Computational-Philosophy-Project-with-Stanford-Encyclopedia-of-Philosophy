    "main_text": "\n\nScience is often distinguished from other domains of human culture by\nits progressive nature: in contrast to art, religion, philosophy,\nmorality, and politics, there exist clear standards or normative\ncriteria for identifying improvements and advances in science. For\nexample, the historian of science George Sarton argued that \u201cthe\nacquisition and systematization of positive knowledge are the only\nhuman activities which are truly cumulative and progressive,\u201d\nand \u201cprogress has no definite and unquestionable meaning in\nother fields than the field of science\u201d (Sarton 1936). However,\nthe traditional cumulative view of scientific knowledge was\neffectively challenged by many philosophers of science in the 1960s\nand the 1970s, and thereby the notion of progress was also questioned\nin the field of science. Debates on the normative concept of progress\nare at the same time concerned with axiological questions about the\naims and goals of science. The task of philosophical analysis is to\nconsider alternative answers to the question: What is meant by\nprogress in science? This conceptual question can then be complemented\nby the methodological question: How can we recognize progressive\ndevelopments in science? Relative to a definition of progress and an\naccount of its best indicators, one may then study the factual\nquestion: To what extent, and in which respects, is science\nprogressive? \n",
