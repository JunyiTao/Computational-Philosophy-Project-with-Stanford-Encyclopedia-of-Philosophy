Further Research\n\nIn light of the foregoing, it seems that further research on the\nfollowing issues would be especially beneficial.\n\nThe first is determining the precise conditions under which epistemic\ncircularity is problematic. Though some epistemic circularity appears\nunavoidable, this would aid in determining the relative initial\nepistemological standing of intuition and perception.\n\nThe second is determining the exact actual and possible extent of\nintuitive disagreement and the proper response to such disagreement.\nThis would enable the proper evaluation of what appears to be the most\nserious sort of skeptical argument.\n",
