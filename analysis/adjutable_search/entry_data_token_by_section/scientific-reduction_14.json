    "main_text": "Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of mind || Local reductions and disjunctive kinds\n3.3 Local reductions and disjunctive kinds\n\nAnti-reductionist arguments based on the assumption that mental kinds\nare multiply realizable have been attacked on at least two different\ngrounds.\n\nClapp (2001) and Walter (2006) argued that high-level kinds can be\nlegitimately identified with disjunctive kinds. The high-level type is\nidentical to a kind we can refer to by a term consisting of a\ndisjunction of expressions each of which refers to one of the\ndifferent low-level kinds that realize the high-level kind:\nHx = (L1x or\nL2x\nor\u2026\u2026Lnx). We may be able\nto specify the relevant term only in principle in cases where the\ndisjunction is infinitely long. This strategy is also pertinent in\nDizadji Bahmani et al. 2010.\n\nAn alternative strategy suggested by David Lewis (1969, 1972) and\ndeveloped by Jaegwon Kim argues in favor of local reductions (Kim\n1992). High-level kinds are multiply realized in virtue of the fact\nthat different physical kinds play the required role in different\norganisms, systems or contexts. Thus, if we individuate the high-level\nkinds in a more fine-grained way, we can save a weaker form of\ntype-identity theory. Even though kind K might be multiply\nrealized by kinds P1, P2, \u2026\nPn, there are more specific contexts\nC1, C2\nCn, such that in each context\nCi, only one physical kind\nPi plays the role of K in that\ncontext. Thus we make more local or contextual identifications. For\nexample, pain in general may not be identical with any one neural\nkind, but we may be able to reductively identify human-pain with one\nneural kind, lizard-pain with a second neural kind and octopus-pain\nwith a third. The relevant context could be species-specific,\nindividual-specific or even specific for conditions of occurrence\nwithin an individual.\n\nThis idea was further developed by Brian Loar (1981: ch. 4), Jackson,\nPargetter and Prior (1982), and Michael Esfeld and Christian Sachse\n(Sachse 2007; Esfeld and Sachse 2007). Esfeld and Sachse (2007) and\nSachse (2007) describe how this insight can be accommodated within the\nhigh-level science by constructing fine-grained versions of the\nhigh-level types\u2014so called \u2018functional\nsub-types\u2019\u2014which can then be linked to the relevant\nlow-level kinds, using the resources of high-level science.\n",
