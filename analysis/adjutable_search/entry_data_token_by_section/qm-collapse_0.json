    "main_text": "General Considerations\n1. General Considerations\n\nA very natural question, which all scientists who are concerned about\nthe meaning and the value of science have to face, is whether one can\ndevelop a coherent worldview that can accommodate our knowledge of\nnatural phenomena as it is embodied in our best theories. Such a\nprogram meets serious difficulties with quantum mechanics, essentially\nbecause of two formal aspects of the theory according to its standard\nformulation, which are common to all of its versions, from the\noriginal nonrelativistic formulations of the 1920s, to current quantum\nfield theories: the linear nature of the state space and of the\nevolution equation; in other words: the validity of the superposition\nprinciple and the related phenomenon of entanglement, which, in\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s words: \n\n\nis not one but the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one\nthat enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought\n(Schr\u00f6dinger 1935: 807).\n\n\nThese two formal features have embarrassing consequences, since they\nimply \n\nobjective indefiniteness of physical properties both at the micro\nand macro level, unless the state collapses;\nobjective chance in natural processes, i.e., the nonepistemic\nnature of quantum probabilities; and\nobjective entanglement between spatially separated and\nnon-interacting constituents of a composite system, entailing a sort\nof holism and a precise kind of nonlocality.\n\n\nFor the sake of generality, we shall first of all present a very\nconcise sketch of \u2018the rules of the quantum game\u2019.\n",
