    "main_text": "Three useful constructions\n5. Three successful programmes\n\n\nEvery healthy branch of mathematics needs a set of problems that form a\nserious challenge for its researchers. We close with a brief\nintroduction to some of the research programmes that drove first-order\nmodel theory forwards in the second half of the twentieth century. The\nbook of Marcja and Toffalori in the bibliography gives further\ninformation about these programmes. There are other current programmes\nbesides these; see for example the handbook edited by Yuri Ershov,\nwhich is about model theory when the structures are built recursively. \n5.1. Categoricity and classification\n\n\nIn 1904 Oswald Veblen described a theory as categorical if it\nhas just one model up to isomorphism, i.e. it has a model and all its\nmodels are isomorphic to each other.  (The name was suggested to him\nby John Dewey, who also suggested the name \u2018disjunctive\u2019\nfor other theories.  This pair of terms come from traditional logic as\nnames of types of sentence.) The depressing news is that there are no\ncategorical first-order theories with infinite models; we can see this\nat once from the upward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem. In fact if T is\na first-order theory with infinite models, then the strongest kind of\ncategoricity we can hope for in T is that for certain infinite\ncardinals \u03ba, T has exactly one model of cardinality \u03ba, up\nto isomorphism. This property of T is called\n\u03ba-categoricity. \n\n\nNow there is a heuristic principle that many people have used,\nthough it seems to have no simple formulation. We suggest \u2018Few is\nbeautiful\u2019. The principle says that if a first-order theory T\nconstrains its models (of a particular cardinality) to be all similar\nto each other, this can only be because the models of T have few\nirregularities and asymmetries. So there should be a good structural\ndescription of these models. One should expect that they are\n\u2018good structures\u2019 from the point of view of classical\nmathematics. As a first step, one easily sees from the upward and\ndownward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems that if T is \u03ba-categorical\nfor some \u03ba at least as large as the number of formulas in the\nlanguage of T, then T must be a complete theory. From now on, T is a\ncomplete theory with infinite models; and for simplicity we will\nassume that the language of T is countable.\n\n\nIn 1954 Jerzy \u0141o\u015b announced that he could only find three\nkinds of example of theories T that are \u03ba-categorical.\nNamely:\n\nT is totally categorical if it is \u03ba-categorical for\nevery infinite cardinal \u03ba. A typical example is the complete\ntheory of an infinite-dimensional vector space over a finite\nfield.\nT is uncountably categorical (but not totally categorical)\nif it is \u03ba-categorical precisely when \u03ba is uncountable.\nEssentially the only example that \u0141o\u015b could find was the\ncomplete theory of an algebraically closed field; this is uncountably\ncategorical by a well-known theorem of Steinitz.\nT is countably categorical (but not uncountably\ncategorical) if it is \u03ba-categorical precisely when \u03ba is\ncountable. A typical example is the complete theory of a dense linear\nordering with no first or last element; this is countably categorical\nby a well-known theorem of Cantor.\n\n\n\n\u0141o\u015b asked whether there are any other possibilities besides\nthese three. (Of course most complete theories are not\n\u03ba-categorical for any \u03ba.) \n\n\nThis question of \u0141o\u015b was a tremendous stimulus to\nresearch, and it led to a classic paper of Michael Morley in 1965 which\nshowed that \u0141o\u015b\u2019s three possibilities are in fact the only\nones. One central idea of Morley\u2019s analysis was that models of an\nuncountably categorical theory have the smallest possible number of\ntypes of element; this led directly to the branch of model theory\ncalled stability theory, which studies theories that have a\nlimited number of element types. These theories have the remarkable\nproperty that every infinite indiscernible sequence in any of their\nmodels is indiscernible under any linear ordering whatever; so these\nsequences are a kind of generalisation of bases of vector spaces.\nAnother idea implicit in Morley\u2019s work, but much clarified by later\nwork of William Marsh, John Baldwin and Alistair Lachlan, was that in\nany model of an uncountably categorical theory there is a central core\n(called a strongly minimal set) which carries a dependence\nrelation obeying similar laws to linear dependence in vector spaces. In\nterms of this dependence relation one can define a dimension for the\nmodel, and what remains of the model outside the core is so closely\ntied to the core that the dimension determines the model up to\nisomorphism.\n\n\nSaharon Shelah developed Morley\u2019s ideas with great resourcefulness and\nenergy. His main aim was to stretch the \u2018Few is beautiful\u2019\nidea by showing that there are clear dividing lines between kinds of\ntheory T. On one side of a dividing line are theories with some good\nstructural property that forces the number of nonisomorphic models of\na given cardinality to be small. On the other side, every theory has\n(for example) two models of the same cardinality that are not\nisomorphic but are extremely hard to tell apart. Shelah coined the\nname classification theory for this research. The text of\nLascar listed below is an elegant introduction to this whole\nprogramme, from \u0141o\u015b to Shelah.  Meanwhile Shelah himself has\nextended it far beyond first-order logic.  Even in the first-order\ncase, Shelah had to invent new set-theoretic techniques (such as\nproper forcing) to carry out his constructions.\n Classification theory has two related though fundamentally\ndistinct aims: to classify the models of a theory (or to show that\nsuch a classification is impossible) by some relatively simple\ncombinatorial invariants and to classify theories themselves by the\npresence or absence of some fundamental structures within their\nmodels.  With the second edition of Classification Theory, Shelah\ndropped the subtitle \u201cAnd the number of non-isomorphic\nmodels\u201d in order to emphasize the broader goals of the project.\nIn general, a class of theories may be recognized as classification\ntheoretically robust if it admits characterizations both in terms of\ncardinals and with respect to some absolute condition on formulae\nrelative to the theory.  For example, by definition, a theory T in a\nlanguage L is stable if there is some cardinal \u03ba \u2265 |L| so\nthat for every model M of T of cardinality at most \u03ba, the number\nof 1-types over M is at most \u03ba.  Equivalently, a theory T is\nstable if no formula has the order property relative to T.\nThat is, there is no L-formula \u03c6(x;y)\n(where x and y may be tuples of variables) so that for\neach natural number n it is consistent with T that there be\na1,\n\u2026, an; b1, \u2026,\nbn so that\n\u03c6(ai,bj) holds\njust in case i \u2264 j.\n\n5.2. Geometric model theory\n\n Geometric model theory grew out of Michael Morley\u2019s 1965 paper, but in\na different direction from Shelah\u2019s work (though today it makes regular\nuse of technical tools developed by Shelah in his classification\nprogramme). Morley had shown that models of an uncountably categorical\ntheory have structural properties that are interesting in their own\nright, regardless of the complete theory of the structure; so it became\nthe custom to talk of uncountably categorical structures,\nmeaning models of uncountably categorical theories. (And likewise\ntotally categorical structures.) Independently Boris Zilber in\nSiberia and Greg Cherlin in the United States noticed that any infinite\ngroup that is definable in an uncountably categorical structure must\nhave many features in common with the algebraic groups studied by\nalgebraic geometers. Zilber in particular showed that many methods from\nalgebraic geometry generalise to the model-theoretic case. His secret\nweapon was Bezout\u2019s Theorem from geometry, which he used to guide him\nto solutions of very difficult model theoretic problems; for example\nhis theorem that no totally categorical theory can be axiomatised by a\nfinite number of axioms. (It was secret in the sense that it guided his\nintuition but never appeared explicitly in his results.) Zilber also\nnoticed an important difference between the first and second of \u0141o\u015b\u2019s\nexamples above. Namely, in a vector space the subspaces (i.e. the\nsubsets closed under linear dependence) form a modular lattice; but the\nalgebraically closed subsets of an algebraically closed field form a\nlattice that is not modular. \n\n\nPartly because of the difficulty of communications between Siberia\nand the West, these results of Zilber took some time to digest, and in\npart they had to be rediscovered in the West. But when the message did\nfinally get through, the result was a new branch of model theory which\nhas come to be known as geometric model theory. The programme\nis broadly to classify structures according to (a) what groups or\nfields are interpretable in them (in the sense sketched in the entry\n on\n model theory)\n and (b) whether or not the\nstructures have \u2018modular geometries\u2019; and then to use this\nclassification to solve problems in model theory and geometry. From\nthe mid 1980s the leader of this research was Ehud Hrushovski. In\nthe early 1990s, using joint work with Zilber, Hrushovski gave a\nmodel-theoretic proof (the first complete proof to be found) of the\ngeometric Mordell-Lang conjecture in all characteristics; this was a\nconjecture in classical diophantine geometry. Bouscaren (ed.) 1998\nis devoted to Hrushovski\u2019s proof and\nthe necessary background in model theory. Both (a) and (b) are\nfundamental to Hrushovski\u2019s argument.\n5.3. O-minimality\n\n\nOf the three programmes described here, this is the oldest, since it\ngrew out of Tarski\u2019s description of the complete theory of the field of\nreal numbers (which he proved by the method of quantifier elimination).\n In the course of giving this description,\nTarski had shown that every first-order formula \u03c6(x) in\nthe relevant language, possibly with parameters, is satisfied by\nexactly the same assignments as some boolean combination of formulas of\nthe form x < s or t < x where s,\nt are constant terms naming parameters. Another way of saying\nthis is that \nEvery set of elements definable by a first-order formula is\na finite union of open intervals with named endpoints, together with\nsome finite set of elements.\n\n\nA linearly ordered structure with this property is said to be\no-minimal. (The idea of the name is that o-minimality is an\nanalogue of \u2018strong minimality\u2019, in a form that makes sense\nfor structures that carry a linear ordering, whence \u2018o-\u2019\nfor ordering.) \n\n\nIn 1982 Lou van den Dries showed that the fact that the field of\nreal numbers is o-minimal gives a large amount of useful information\nabout the definable sets of higher dimension, such as the family of\ndefinable subsets of the real plane. Soon after this, Julia Knight,\nAnand Pillay and Charles Steinhorn noticed that if a structure\nA is o-minimal, then so is any structure elementarily\nequivalent to A, and that van den Dries\u2019 analysis of\nhigher-dimensional definable set applies to all these structures. These\nresults led to much activity on the frontier between model theory and\nfunction theory. Several old problems from model theory and function\ntheory were solved. Alex Wilkie showed that the field of real numbers\nwith a symbol for exponentiation is o-minimal and has a model-complete\ncomplete theory, and thereby gave a positive answer to Tarski\u2019s old\nproblem of whether this structure allows a quantifier elimination,\nthough his method was very far from the syntactic analysis that Tarski\nhad in mind.   (This is one case where we need to remember the difference \nbetween being model-complete and having quantifier elimination;  \nsee section 2 above.  The question whether this particular theory \nhas quantifier elimination is much harder and is closely related to \na deep conjecture of number theory called Schanuel\u2019s conjecture;  \nsee the paper of Macintyre and Wilkie.)\nWe now know a wide range of ways of adding interesting\nfeatures to the field of real numbers in such a way that the resulting\nstructure is still o-minimal (and hence in some sense mathematically\ntractable). Van den Dries has urged that o-minimal structures provide a\ngood setting for developing the \u2018tame topology\u2019 programme\nof Alexander Grothendieck.\n\nIn 2006, Jonathan Pila and Alex Wilkie showed that provided one\nremoves the subsets defined using only polynomial inequalities,\nsubsets of Rn definable in an\no-minimal expansion of the real field have few rational points.\nSubsequently, following a strategy first employed by Pila and Umberto\nZannier to reprove the Manin-Mumford conjecture various authors have\nused this o-minimal counting theorem to solve some important open\nproblems in diophantine geometry.\n\nKobi Peterzil and Sergei Starchenko have developed a \ntheory of o-minimal complex analysis.   Just as with \nthe classical approach to complex analysis, one may interpret \nthe complex numbers as the set of ordered pairs of real numbers \nwith addition and multiplication defined by the usual rules \ninvolving their real and imaginary parts.  Of their results in this \narea, their algebraicity theorem, which asserts that if a subset of \nCn is complex analytic (meaning that it\nis closed and is locally defined by the vanishing of finitely many \ncomplex analytic functions) and definable in some o-minimal expansion\nof the real field, then it must be algebraic, that is defined by the \nvanishing of polynomial equations, is the most striking result and \nhas been strong consequences in the study of functional transcendence and\nhomogeneous dynamics. \n\n\nAll three of these programmes generated new techniques for proof, constructions\nand classifications.  As we should expect, researchers have explored the range of\napplication of each technique.  One result of this has been the emergence of\nseveral useful classes of first-order theories which relate to more than\none of the three programmes.  For example a central tool of\nShelah\u2019s classification theory was his notion of forking, a\nfar-reaching generalisation of earlier algebraic notions of dependence\nrelation.  The class of simple theories is defined by the fact that\nforking has certain nice properties while the class of\nrosy theories is characterised by the existence of a good notion\nof independence coming from a further generalisation of forking called\n\u00fe-forking; several natural examples of simple theories\ncame to light in geometric model theory, and the complete theories of\no-minimal structures are examples of rosy theories.  In parallel with\nthese technical advances, first-order model theory continues to grow\nmore closely involved with problems in number theory, functional\nanalysis and other branches of pure and, and even applied,\nmathematics.\nIn Shelah's programme of classification theory, a central\nr\u00f4le is played by\ndividing lines.  That is, the class of all theories should be\ndivided into those having some property and those which do not and\nthis division into these two classes should be authentic in the sense\nthat the classes should admit various definitions of different\ncharacters.  For example, the class of stable theories may be\ndescribed in many facially dissimilar ways as, for example, those\ntheories with respect to which every type is definable, those with\nrespect to which no formula has the order property, or those for which\nthere is some infinite cardinal \u03ba at least as large as\nthat of the language for which over every model of size \u03ba\nthere are no more than \u03ba many 1-types.  Many of\nthese classification theoretic classes are defined by forbidding the\nexistence of certain combinatorial configurations.  For example, the\nclass of dependent or NIP (for \"Not the Independence\nProperty\") theories is defined by saying that for no formula\n\u03c6(x,y) is it possible to find a model\nM and sequences\n(ai)i=0\u221e and\n(bS) where the b sequence is indexed by the\nsubsets of the natural numbers so that\n\u03c6(ai,bS) if and only if\ni \u2208 S.  Around the same time that Shelah isolated the\nindependence property, Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis\ndiscovered the same notion in machine learning theory.  Consequences\nof the model theoretic analysis of NIP have since been drawn in theory\nof neural networks, extremal combinatorics, the theory of differential\nprivacy, and machine learning theory more broadly.\n\n",
