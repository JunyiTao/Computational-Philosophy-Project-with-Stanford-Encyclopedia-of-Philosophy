    "main_text": "Philosophical Relevance || Critique of Cognitive Science\n5.2 Critique of Cognitive Science\n\nThe claim that human minds work by representation and computation is\nan empirical conjecture and might be wrong. Although the\n computational-representational\n approach to cognitive science has been successful in explaining many\naspects of human problem solving, learning, and language use, some\nphilosophical critics have claimed that this approach is fundamentally\nmistaken. Critics of cognitive science have offered such challenges\nas:\n\nThe\n emotion\n challenge: Cognitive science neglects the important role of emotions\nin human thinking.\nThe\n consciousness\n challenge: Cognitive science ignores the importance of consciousness\nin human thinking.\nThe world challenge: Cognitive science disregards the significant\nrole of physical environments in human thinking, which is embedded in\nand extended into the world.\nThe body challenge: Cognitive science neglects the contribution of\n embodiment\n to human thought and action.\nThe dynamical systems challenge: The mind is a dynamical system,\nnot a computational system.\nThe social challenge: Human thought is inherently social in ways\nthat cognitive science ignores.\nThe mathematics challenge: Mathematical results show that human\nthinking cannot be computational in the standard sense, so the brain\nmust operate differently, perhaps as a quantum computer.\nThe interdisciplinarity challenge: Cognitive science has failed to\ngo beyond multidisciplinary interactions by developing a core theory\nthat unifies work in its many disciplines.\n\n\nThe first five challenges are increasingly addressed by advances that\nexplain emotions, consciousness, action, and embodiment in terms of\nneural mechanisms. The social challenge is being met by the\ndevelopment of computational models of interacting agents. The\nmathematics challenge is based on misunderstanding of\n G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem\n and on exaggeration of the relevance of quantum theory to neural\nprocesses. Response to the interdisciplinary challenge must recognize\nthat cognitive science still has many contending theoretical\napproaches, without the unification that theories of evolution and\ngenetics provide for biology. Nevertheless, interactions among\npsychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, and\ncomputer modeling have contributed to theoretical and empirical\nprogress concerning many aspects of cognition. For example,\n computational philosophy\n uses programmed models to address questions in epistemology, ethics,\nand other areas of philosophy.\n",
