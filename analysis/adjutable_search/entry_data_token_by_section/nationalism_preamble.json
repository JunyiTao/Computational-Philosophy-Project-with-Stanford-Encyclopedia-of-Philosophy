    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201cnationalism\u201d is generally used to describe two\nphenomena: \n\nthe attitude that the members of a nation have when they care\nabout their national identity, and\nthe actions that the members of a nation take when seeking to\nachieve (or sustain) self-determination.\n\n\n(1) raises questions about the concept of a nation (or national\nidentity), which is often defined in terms of common origin,\nethnicity, or cultural ties, and specifically about whether an\nindividual\u2019s membership in a nation should be regarded as\nnon-voluntary or voluntary. (2) raises questions about whether\nself-determination must be understood as involving having full\nstatehood with complete authority over domestic and international\naffairs, or whether something less is required.\n\nNationalism came into the focus of philosophical debate three decades\nago, in the nineties, partly in consequence of rather spectacular and\ntroubling nationalist clashes. Surges of nationalism tend to present a\nmorally ambiguous, and for this reason often fascinating, picture.\n\u201cNational awakening\u201d and struggles for political\nindependence are often both heroic and cruel; the formation of a\nrecognizably national state often responds to deep popular sentiment\nbut sometimes yields inhuman consequences, from violent expulsion and\n\u201ccleansing\u201d of non-nationals to organized mass murder. The\nmoral debate on nationalism reflects a deep moral tension between\nsolidarity with oppressed national groups on the one hand and\nrepulsion in the face of crimes perpetrated in the name of nationalism\non the other. Moreover, the issue of nationalism points to a wider\ndomain of problems related to the treatment of ethnic and cultural\ndifferences within democratic polity, arguably among the most pressing\nproblems of contemporary political theory.\n\nIn the last two decades, migration crisis and the populist reactions\nto migration and domestic economic issues have been the defining\ntraits of a new political constellation. The traditional issue of the\ncontrast between nationalism and cosmopolitanism has changed its\nprofile: the current drastic contrast is between populist aversion to\nthe foreigners-migrants and a more generous, or simply just, attitude\nof acceptance and Samaritan help. The populist aversion inherits some\nfeatures traditionally associated with patriotism and nationalism, and\nthe opposite attitude the main features of traditional\ncosmopolitanism. One could expect that the work on nationalism will be\nmoving further on this new and challenging playground, addressing the\nnew contrast and trying to locate nationalism in relation to it.\n\nIn this entry, we shall first present conceptual issues of definition\nand classification (Sections 1 and 2) and then the arguments put\nforward in the debate (Section 3), dedicating more space to the\narguments in favor of nationalism than to those against it in order to\ngive the philosophical nationalist a proper hearing. In the last part\nwe shall turn to the new constellation and sketch the new issues\nraised by nationalist and trans-nationalist populisms and the\nmigration crisis.\n",
