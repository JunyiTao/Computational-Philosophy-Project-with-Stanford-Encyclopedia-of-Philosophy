Integrity as Self-Integration\n\nOn the self-integration view of integrity, integrity is a matter of\npersons integrating various parts of their personality into a\nharmonious, intact whole. Understood in this way, the integrity of\npersons is analogous to the integrity of things: integrity is\nprimarily a matter of keeping the self intact and uncorrupted. The\nself-integration view of integrity makes integrity a formal relation\nto the self.\n\nWhat is a formal relation to the self? One answer is that a formal\nrelation can be attributed to a person without evaluating the\nrelation\u2019s components. Strength of will is probably a formal\nrelation one has to oneself. Very roughly, we might say that a display\nof strength of will is a particular relation between a person\u2019s\nintention and corresponding action: it is a matter of acting on an\nintention given serious obstacles to the action. This is a formal\nrelation to the self in the sense we are after because we don\u2019t\nneed to evaluate the appropriateness, value, justice, practical\nwisdom, and so on, either of the intention or corresponding action in\norder to identify the whole thing as a case of strength of will. We\nmight think that all displays of strength of will are valuable, so we\nmight have certain pro-attitudes to an action simply because it is an\nattempt to fulfill an intention in the face of serious obstacles. Yet\nwe don\u2019t need to make this evaluation in order to attribute a\ndisplay of strength of will to someone. All we need to do is inspect\nthe correspondence of intention and action given the difficulty of\nacting on the intention. We don\u2019t need to evaluate whether the\nintention is directed at anything worthwhile, for example. John\nBigelow and Robert Pargetter (2007) argue that strength of will is the\ncore of integrity (and that alternative conceptions of integrity tend\nto confuse integrity with authenticity). The self-integration account\nof integrity takes this formal characterization of integrity a step\nfurther. Self-integration is an achievement rather than a quality or\ndisposition such as strength of will \u2014 though strength of will\nis likely to be an important quality in those who achieve\nself-integration. Self-integration still represents a formal account\nof integrity. In attributing self-integration to a person we are\nmaking no evaluative judgement of the states that are integrated\nwithin the person.\n\nOne instructive attempt to describe the fully integrated self is Harry\nFrankfurt\u2019s (Frankfurt 1987, 33\u201334). Frankfurt does not\nexplicitly address himself to the problem of defining integrity,\nnonetheless he does describe an important and influential account of\nself-integration. According to Frankfurt, desires and volitions (acts\nof will) are arranged in a hierarchy. First-order desires are desires\nfor various goods; second-order desires are desires that one desire\ncertain goods, or that one act on one first-order desire rather than\nanother. Similarly, one may will a particular action (first-order\nvolition) or one may will that one\u2019s first order volitions are\nof a particular sort (second-order volition). Second-order desires and\nvolitions pave the way for third-order desires and volitions, and so\non. According to Frankfurt, wholly integrated persons bring these\nvarious levels of volition and desire into harmony and fully identify\nwith them at the highest level. There are various ideas as to what it\nmeans to fully identify with higher-level desires and volitions.\nHowever, such identification appears to involve knowing them; not\ndeceiving oneself about them; and acting on them (usually).\n\nA person is subject to many conflicting desires. If one simply acted\nat each moment out of the strongest current desire, with no\ndeliberation or discrimination between more or less worthwhile\ndesires, then one clearly acts without integrity. Frankfurt calls such\na person a \u2018wanton\u2019 (Frankfurt 1971). Integrity thus\nrequires that one discriminate between first-order desires. One may do\nthis by endorsing certain first-order desires and\n\u2018outlawing\u2019 others. For instance, one may endorse a desire\nto study and \u2018outlaw\u2019 a desire to party, and do so by\nreference to a higher order desire ranking success over fun.\nSecond-order desires may conflict. One may value success over fun, but\nalso both fear that a ruthless pursuit of success will make one boring\nand value being fun over being boring. Fully integrated persons will\nnot fall victim to such conflict; they will either avoid it altogether\n(if they can) or resolve the conflict in some way. Resolution of\nself-conflict may be achieved by appeal to yet higher level desires or\nvolitions, or by deciding to endorse one set of desires and outlawing\nothers. At some point the full integration of one\u2019s self will\nrequire that one decide upon a certain structure of higher level\ndesires and order one\u2019s lower level desires and volitions in\nlight of it. As Frankfurt puts it, when a person unreservedly decides\nto endorse a particular desire:\n\n\u2026 the person no longer holds himself at all apart from the desire to\nwhich he has committed himself. It is no longer unsettled or uncertain\nwhether the object of that desire\u2014that is, what he\nwants\u2014is what he really wants: The decision determines what the\nperson really wants by making the desires upon which he decides fully\nhis own. To this extent the person, in making a decision by which he\nidentifies with a desire, constitutes himself. (Frankfurt\n1987, 38)\n\n\nWhen agents thus constitute themselves without ambivalence (that is,\nunresolved desire for a thing and against it) or inconsistency (that\nis, unresolved desire for incompatible things), then the agent has\nwhat Frankfurt calls wholeheartedness. On one way of developing the\nintegrated-self view of integrity, wholeheartedness is equated with\nintegrity. It should be noted that self-conflict is not limited to\ndesire. Conflict also ranges over commitments, principles, values, and\nwishes. Furthermore, all of these things\u2014desires, commitments,\nvalues, and so on\u2014are in flux. They change over time so that\nachieving the kind of \u2018wholeheartedness\u2019 that Frankfurt\ndescribes is a never-ending process and task. Self-knowledge is\ncrucial to this process in so far as one must know what one\u2019s\nvalues, for example, are if one is to order them.\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s account illustrates one way of describing the\nfully-integrated self. (See Taylor 1981 for a different approach.) The\nkey question, however, is whether the idea of a fully-integrated self\nadequately captures the quality we ascribe when we say of someone that\nthey are a person of integrity. There have been a number of criticisms\nof the integrated-self view of integrity. First, it places only formal\nlimits on the kind of person who may be said to have integrity. People\nof integrity, however, are plausibly thought to be generally honest\nand genuine in their dealings with others. (See Halfon 1989,\n7\u20138.) Imagine a person who sells used-cars for a living and is\nwholeheartedly dedicated to selling cars for as much money as\npossible. Such a person will be prepared to blatantly lie in order to\nset up a deal. The person may well be perfectly integrated in\nFrankfurt\u2019s sense, but we should feel no temptation at all to\ndescribe them as having exemplary integrity.\n\nSecond, a person of integrity is plausibly said to make reasonable\njudgments about the relative importance of various desires and\ncommitments. Yet, again, the self-integration view places only formal\nlimits on the kind of desires that constitute a self. (See McFall\n1987, 9\u201311, Calhoun 1995, 237\u201338). As McFall notes, one\ncannot say with a straight face something like: \u2018Harold\ndemonstrates great integrity in his single-minded pursuit of\napproval.\u2019 (McFall 1987, 9; we discuss McFall\u2019s views more\nfully in Section 4, below.) If integrity is nothing more than the\nperfect integration of self, however, it is hard to see how one can\nautomatically deny Harold\u2019s integrity.\n\nThird, on some accounts, the fully and perfectly integrated person is\nnot able to experience genuine temptation. Temptation requires that\nthe full force of an \u2018outlaw\u2019 desire be experienced, but\nsuccessful integration of the self may mean that such desires are\nfully subordinated to wholeheartedly endorsed desires and this may\npreclude an agent fully experiencing them. (See Taylor 1981, 151 for\nan example of a view like this.) That a person experiences, and\novercomes, temptation would count against their integrity on such a\nview. One might think, however, that a capacity to overcome temptation\nand display strength of character is in fact a sign of a\nperson\u2019s integrity, not its lack. (Halfon 1989, 44\u20137 urges\nthis criticism.)\n\nFourth, Cheshire Calhoun argues that agents may find themselves in\nsituations in which wholeheartedness tends to undermine their\nintegrity rather than constitute it (Calhoun 1995, 238\u201341; see\nalso, Cox, La Caze and Levine 2003, 18\u20132.) Victoria Davion\n(1991) argues that a person may change radically and yet maintain\nintegrity. In the midst of a complex and multifaceted life one may\nhave compelling reasons to avoid neatly resolving incompatible\ndesires. The cost of the resolution of all self-conflict may be a\nwithdrawal from aspects of life that make genuine claims upon us.\nResolving self-conflict at the expense of fully engaging with\ndifferent parts of one\u2019s life does not seem to contribute to\none\u2019s integrity. It seems rather like the sort of cop-out that\nundermines integrity. (One should not confuse integrity with\nneatness.)\n\nChristian Golden (2019, 505) goes further in seeking to avoid\n\u2018framing ambivalence and conflict as defects of character and\naction\u2019, proposing humility as an alternative ideal to\nwholeheartedness as a model of personal integrity.\n\nOne possibility here is to acknowledge different kinds of integrity.\nFor example, Matthew Pianalto (2012) distinguishes between\npsychological integrity (a form of self-integration) and practical\nintegrity in order to deal with the integrity of agents for whom\nwholeheartedness is not a realistic option. Alfred Archer (2017, 435,\n453) argues that an integrated self has value whether or not we equate\nit with the virtue of integrity. Its principle value resides in the\neffect it has on moral agency. Self-integrated people tend\noverwhelmingly to be better, more effective moral agents than people\nwho are not integrated. Disintegration tends to undermine agency in\ngeneral, but most importantly, it tends to undermine moral agency.\nMoral exemplars exhibit strong traits of self-integration. The\nimportance and value of self-integration need not be identified with\nthe importance of integrity. They may have different foundations.\n",
