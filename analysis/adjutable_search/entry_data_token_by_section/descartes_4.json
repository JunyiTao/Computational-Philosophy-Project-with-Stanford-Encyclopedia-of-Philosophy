If\nDescartes were fully consistent, he would make no claims about\nGod\u2019s plans or his Providential acts and there would be no\nmiracles in his world (Light VII, 11:48; Princ.\nIII.2\u20133; see also Corr. 2:558, 3:214).\n\nDespite his precautions, he was drawn into theological controversy\nwith the Jesuits over Bourdin\u2019s set of objections, which led him\nto write to Father Dinet, Bourdin\u2019s superior, to allay any fears\nthat Descartes\u2019 philosophy caused theological difficulty\n(7:581). He was also drawn into theological controversy with Calvinist\ntheologians in the Netherlands. In the latter 1630s, Henry le Roy\n(1598\u20131679), or Regius, a professor of medicine in Utrecht,\ntaught Descartes\u2019 system of natural philosophy. Already by 1640,\nGisbertus Voetius (1589\u20131676), a theologian at Utrecht,\nexpressed his displeasure over this to Mersenne (3:230). Controversy\nbrewed, and Descartes included an attack on Voetius in the Letter to\nDinet. Voetius, as rector of the University, convinced the faculty\nsenate to condemn Descartes\u2019 (and Regius\u2019) philosophy in\n1642. He and his colleagues attacked Descartes in disputations in 1642\nand in a book by Martin Schoock (1643), to which Descartes responded\nwith a Letter to Voetius (1643). The controversy simmered.\nDescartes eventually fell out with Regius, who published a broadsheet\nmanifesto that deviated from Descartes\u2019 theory of the human\nmind. Descartes replied with his Comments on a Certain\nBroadsheet (1648). In 1648 he drafted a further response to\nongoing attacks by Voetius, ultimately published in 1656 (Querela\napologetica).\n\nIn the mid-1640s, Descartes continued work on his physiological\nsystem, which he had pursued throughout the 1630s. He allowed the\nunpublished manuscript of the Treatise on Man to be copied\n(4:566\u20137) and he began a new work (5:112), Description of\nthe Human Body, in which he sought to explain the embryonic\ndevelopment of animal bodies. During this period he corresponded with\nPrincess Elisabeth of Bohemia (daughter of Frederick V, a Protestant,\nand briefly King of Bohemia), now living in the Netherlands, at first\non metaphysical topics from the Meditations and then on the\npassions and emotions. Eventually, he wrote the Passions of the\nSoul (1649), a comprehensive and original theory of the passions\nand emotions that presented the most extensive account of his\nbehavioral physiology published during his lifetime.\n\nIn 1649, Descartes accepted the invitation of Queen Christina of\nSweden to join her court. At her request, he composed the Statutes of\nthe Swedish Royal Academy. On the day he gave them to her, he became\nill. He never recovered, and died on 11 February 1650.
