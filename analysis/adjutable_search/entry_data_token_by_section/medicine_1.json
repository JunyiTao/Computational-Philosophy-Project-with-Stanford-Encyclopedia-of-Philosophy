Contested and Controversial Disease Categories\n\nSome disease categories are far from straightforward in terms of being\nrecognized, named, classified, and made legitimate both within\nmedicine itself and for the wider society. In recent times there have\nbeen long-standing debates over a range of conditions including Lyme\ndisease, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), to name\njust a few (for extended historical discussions of these and related\nconditions, see Aronowitz 1998, 2001; Shorter 2008). Take CFS as an\nexample: its main symptoms are fatigue after exertion over a period\nlasting at least six months, but sufferers can have a wide array of\ncomplaints in diverse systems of the body; the range of severity is as\nwide as the range of symptoms. The condition has been associated with\nseveral other controversial syndromes and sometimes equated to with\nthem, most notably myalgic encephalitis and fibromyalgia, as well as\nother illnesses of inexact definition such as multiple chemical\nsensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome; more popular (and\nderogatory) labels also have been attached to it such as yuppie flu.\nDefinitive evidence as to the cause or basis of CFS has remained\nelusive, and in the absence of causal explanations, accurate diagnoses\nand effective treatments often have been difficult to obtain. Thus the\nillness has been perceived by many as being illegitimate because of\ndifficulties in proving the existence of a discrete disease condition,\ngiven the lack of traditional forms of clinical evidence for it, and\nit has had different statuses in different locales (see Ankeny and\nMackenzie 2016). These issues severely impact on the lives of those\naffected by this condition, and on the care that is thought to be\nappropriate to be made available to them.\n\nMental illnesses (and the term \u201cmental health\u201d itself)\nalso have traditionally posed considerable problems for categorization\nand conceptualization for both medical practitioners and philosophers\nof medicine. Many authors advocate the case that it is critical to\nmake a distinction between mental and physical illness (Macklin 1972),\nparticularly because of the moral implications associated with\nlabeling a condition as mental or psychological. Psychiatry is a field\nwhich has historically been loaded with value judgments, many of which\nwere quite dubious. There is a long history of using mental illness as\na way to categorize behaviors which are socially deviant as well as\nthose conditions of ill health with no apparent organic cause and\nwhich do not otherwise fit into our dominant biomedical model. Many\nscholars (e.g., Ritchie 1989; Gaines 1992; Mezzich et al. 1996;\nHorwitz and Wakefield 2007; Demazeux and Singy 2015) have critiqued\napproaches and the underlying assumptions of the various editions of\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual published by the American\nPsychiatric Association, which is a \u201cbible\u201d for\npsychiatric conditions for many practitioners and also has\nconsiderable public influence for instance on who can seek care. Key\nexamples of contested issues within the DSM include the highly\npoliticized nature of the processes of revision across various\neditions, various cultural, sexist, and gender biases inherent in\nspecific diagnostic categories, and the relatively weak reliability\nand validity of the classification system.\n\nOne key question is whether the biomedical model is the most\nappropriate approach to psychological or mental conditions and their\ntreatment. Some theorists have argued in favor of naturalistic\naccounts of disease, notably Thomas Szasz (1961, 1973, 1987). As a\nresult, he famously claimed that \u201cmental diseases\u201d are a\nmyth and do not exist because they do not result from tissue damage;\nin his view, all diseases must be correlated with this sort of\nphysical damage. He thus argues that the concept of mental illness is\na prescriptive concept used as though it were a merely descriptive\none, and also a justificatory concept masquerading as an explanatory\none. These conclusions lead him to a highly critical analysis of\npsychiatric practices, and to reclassifying such forms of suffering as\n\u201cproblems in living\u201d rather than diseases. However it is\nnot always clear in his account what his evidence for these claims is,\nand in particular whether he is making an in principle objection or\none that is grounded in the history of the mistreatment of people with\nmental illnesses, and the disservice done to them in part because of\nthe adoption of the medical model. In addition, some have noted that\nsome psychiatric conditions do in fact correlate with physiologically\ndetectable and other types of biological abnormalities. For instance\ntwin studies have demonstrated that genetics is a major factor in the\netiology of schizophrenia among other conditions typically considered\nto be psychiatric, although clearly not all conditions that are\ndiagnosable according to contemporary psychiatric standards fit this\nmodel.\n\nA prominent functionalist approach to mental disorders more recently\nhas been that of Wakefield (1992, 1996, 2007), as discussed above, who\nargues that mental disorders are best understood as\n\u201charmful\u201d dysfunctions, which permits a supposedly\nvalue-free foundation in terms of biological function gauged in\nevolutionary terms) with judgments coming in only in terms of the\njudgment of whether certain dysfunctions are harmful to their bearers.\nSuch accounts have been criticized along lines similar to analyses of\nBoorsian accounts by emphasizing that function and dysfunction cannot\nin fact be defined independently of value terms, but Wakefield\u2019s\naccount also has been questioned in terms of its practical\nimplications (e.g., Sadler and Agich 1995) and whether malfunction is\na necessary component of mental disorder (Murphy and Woolfolk\n2000).\n\nOther authors, notably George Engel (1977), have argued for the need\nto unify our understandings of mental and physical illness under a\nbroader, biopsychosocial model. Such a model would focus clinicians to\ntake account of both the physical, psychological, and social factors\nthat contribute to ill health, in contrast to the traditional\nbiomedical model which is faulted for being overly reductionistic\nrather than holistic. Such an account, it is claimed, would be more\neffective in dealing with borderline cases including people who are\ntold they are in need of treatment due to abnormal lab results or\nsimilar but who are feeling well, as well as those who appear to have\nno underlying somatic disease condition but are feeling unwell. Hence\nthis type of account does not draw any sharp distinction between the\nphysical and the mental (or even the social), leaving the question of\nappropriate therapies or approaches as a matter to be decided by the\ndoctor and his or her patient. Engel compellingly defended this type\nof account as more appropriate not only for clinical work but for\nresearch and teaching in medicine. It is arguable that it has\nimplicitly (and often explicitly) been adopted in much of current-day\nmedical practice and teaching, although it is less clear whether it\nhas had much influence in biomedical research, much of which tends to\nremain more reductionistic in its nature.\n",
