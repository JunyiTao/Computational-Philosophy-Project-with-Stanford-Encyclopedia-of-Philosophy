    "main_text": "Arguments Against Eliminative Materialism || The Self-Refutation Objection\n4.1 The Self-Refutation Objection\n\nMany writers have argued that eliminative materialism is in some sense\nself-refuting (Baker, 1987; Boghossian, 1990, 1991; Reppert, 1992). A\ncommon way this charge is made is to insist that a capacity or\nactivity that is somehow invoked by the eliminativist is itself\nsomething that requires the existence of beliefs. One popular\ncandidate for this activity is the making of an assertion. The critic\ninsists that to assert something one must believe it. Hence, for\neliminative materialism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist\nherself must believe that it is true. But if the eliminativist has\nsuch a belief, then there are beliefs and eliminativism is thereby\nproven false.\n\nEliminativists often respond to this objection by first noting that\nthe bare thesis that there are no beliefs is not itself contradictory\nor conceptually incoherent. So properly understood, the complaint is\nnot that eliminative materialism (qua-proposition) is self-refuting.\nRather, it is that the eliminativist herself is doing something that\ndisconfirms her own thesis. In the above example, the disconfirming\nact is the making of an assertion, as it is alleged by the critic that\nwe must believe anything we assert with public language. However, this\nlast claim is precisely the sort of folk-psychological assumption that\nthe eliminative materialist is suggesting we should abandon. According\nto eliminative materialism, all of the various capacities that we now\nexplain by appealing to beliefs do not actually involve beliefs at\nall. So the eliminativist will hold that the self-refutation critics\nbeg the question against eliminative materialism. To run this sort of\nobjection, the critic endorses some principle about the necessity of\nbeliefs which itself presupposes that eliminative materialism must be\nfalse (P. S. Churchland, 1986; Cling, 1989; Devitt, 1990; Ramsey,\n1991).\n\nA more sophisticated version of the self-refutation objection has been\noffered by Paul Boghossian with regard to eliminativist arguments\nbased on the content of psychological states. Boghossian maintains\nthat arguments for irrealism about the content of propositional\nattitudes work just as well in support of irrealism about all forms of\ncontent, including the content of ordinary linguistic expressions.\nMoreover, he argues that different forms of irrealism about linguistic\ncontent presuppose robust semantic notions, such as realist\nconceptions of truth and reference. This leads to the incoherent\nposition that, for example, there are no truth conditions and yet\ncertain sentences (or beliefs) about content are false (Boghossian,\n1990, 1991). In response, Michael Devitt and Georges Rey argue that\nBoghossian\u2019s argument, despite its sophistication, nevertheless\nbegs the question by ascribing to the eliminativist some version of\ntruth-conditional semantics, whereas many eliminativists would reject\nsuch a view of linguistic expressions. While eliminativists would need\nto construct some sort of non-truth-conditional semantics, Devitt and\nRey argue that the challenge of such a project reveals only that\neliminativism is implausible, not that it is, as Boghossian claims,\nincoherent (Devitt, 1990; Devitt and Rey, 1991).\n",
