Making sense of, and engaging in, dialogue\n\u201cWe\ncan ask just how it is that rhetoric somehow moves us \u2026\nAristotle locates the essential nature of rhetorical undertakings in\nthe ends sought rather than in the purely formal properties.\u201d\n\n\u2013Daniel N. Robinson, Consciousness and Mental Life, (2007:\n171\u20132)\n\n\nDialogue is interactive goal-directed (purposive) behavior, and in that\nsense the most natural form of language. More than in narrative or\ndescriptive language, the flow of surface utterances and speaker\nalternation reflect the interplay of underlying speaker goals and\nintentions. By themselves, however, utterances in a dialogue are\nambiguous as to their purpose, and an understanding of the discourse\ncontext and the domain of discourse are required to formulate or\nunderstand them. For example,\n\n(7.1)  Do you know what day this is?\n\n\n\ncould be understood as a request for an answer such as\n\n\u201cThursday, June 24\u201d, as a reminder of the importance of the\nday, or as a test of the addressee's mental alertness.\nThe immediate goal of such an utterance is to change the mental state\n(especially beliefs, desires and intentions) of the hearer(s), and\nspeech act theory concerns the\nway in which particular types of speech\nacts effect such changes, directly or indirectly (Austin 1962; Grice\n1968; Searle 1969). To choose speech acts sensibly, each participant\nalso needs to take account of the mental state of the other(s); in\nparticular, each needs to recognize\nthe other's beliefs, desires and\nintentions. Discourse conventions in cooperative conversation are\nadapted to facilitate this process: The speakers employ locutions that\nreveal their intended effects, and their acknowledgments and\nturn-taking consolidate mutual understanding. In this way\nmixed-initiative dialogue and potentially, cooperative domain action\nare achieved.\nIn the previous discussion of content\nplanning in language generation,\nwe said little about the formation of communicative intentions in this\nprocess. But in the context of purposive dialogue, it is\nessential to consider how a dialogue agent might arrive at the\nintention to convey certain ideas, such as episodic, instructional or\ndescriptive information, a request,  an acknowledgment and/or\nacceptance of a request, an answer to a question, an argument in\nsupport of a conclusion, etc.\nAs in the case of generating extended descriptions, narrative,\narguments, etc., using RST, a\nnatural perspective here is one centered\naround goal-directed planning. In fact, the application of this\nperspective to dialogue historically preceded its application to\nextended discourses. In particular, Cohen and Perreault (1979) proposed\na reasoning, planning, and plan recognition framework that represents\nspeech acts in terms of their preconditions and effects. For example, a\nsimple INFORM speech act might have the following preconditions\n(formulated for understandability from a first-person speaker\nperspective):\n\nThe\nhearer (my dialogue partner) does not know whether a certain\nproposition X is true; \n the hearer wants to be told by me\nwhether X is true; and  \n I do in fact know whether X is\ntrue.\n\n\nThe effect of implementing the INFORM as an utterance is then that the\nhearer knows whether X is true. An important feature of such\na framework is that it can account for indirect speech acts (Allen and\nPerreault 1980). For example, question (7.1), as an indirect request\nfor the date or day of the week, can be viewed as indicating the\nspeaker's awareness that the hearer can perform the requested\ninformation-conveying act only if the knowledge-precondition of that\nact is satisfied. Furthermore, since the hearer recognizes that\nquestioning a precondition of a potential act is one indirect way of\nrequesting the act, then (unless the context provides evidence to the\ncontrary) the hearer will make the inference that the speaker wants\nthe hearer to perform the information-conveying speech act. Note that\nthe reasoning and planning framework must allow for iterated\nmodalities such as \u201cI believe that you want me to tell you what\ntoday's date is\u201d, or \u201cI believe (because of the request I\njust made) that you know that I want you to pass the salt shaker to\nme\u201d. Importantly, there must also be allowance for mutual\nbeliefs and intentions, so that a common ground can be maintained as\npart of the context and collaboration can take place. A belief is\nmutual if each participant holds the belief, and the participants\nmutually believe that they mutually hold the belief. The mutual\nknowledge of the participants in a dialogue can be assumed to include\nthe overt contents of their utterances and common general knowledge,\nincluding knowledge of discourse conventions.\nSince the ultimate purpose of a dialogue may be to accomplish something\nin the world, not only in the minds of the participants, reasoning,\ngoal-directed planning, and action need to occur at the domain level as\nwell. The goals of speech acts are then not ends in themselves, but\nmeans to other ends in the domain, perhaps to be accomplished by\nphysical action (such as equipment repair). As a result, task-oriented\ndialogues are apt to be structured in a way that follows or \u201cechoes\u201d\nthe structure of the domain entities and the way they can be\npurposefully acted upon. Such considerations led to Grosz and Sidner's\ntheory of dialogue structure in task-oriented dialogues (Grosz and\nSidner 1986). Their theory centers around the idea of shifts of\nattention mediated by pushing and popping of \u201cfocus spaces\u201d on a stack.\nFocus spaces hold in them structured representations of the domain\nactions under consideration. For example, setting a collaborative goal\nof attaching a part to some device would push a corresponding focus\nspace onto the stack. As dictated by knowledge about the physical task,\nthe participants might next verbally commit to the steps of using a\nscrewdriver and some screws to achieve the goal, and this part of the\ndialogue would be mediated by pushing corresponding subspaces onto the\nfocus stack. When a subtask is achieved, the corresponding focus space\nis popped from the stack.\nImplementation of reasoning and planning frameworks covering both the\niterated modalities needed for plan-based dialogue behavior and the\nrealities of a task domain has proved feasible for constrained\ndialogues in restricted domains (e.g.,\nSmith et al. 1995), but\nquickly\ncomes up against a complexity barrier when the coverage of language and\nthe scope of the domain of discourse are enlarged. Planning is in\ngeneral NP-hard, indeed PSPACE-complete even in propositional planning\nformalisms (Bylander 1994), and plan recognition can be exponential in\nthe number of goals to be recognized, even if all plans available for\nachieving the goals are known in advance (Geib 2004).\nIn response to this difficulty, researchers striving to build usable\nsystems have experimented with a variety of strategies. One is to\npre-equip the dialogue system with a hierarchy of carefully engineered\nplans suitable for the type of dialogue to be handled (such as\ntutoring, repair, travel planning or schedule maintenance), and to\nchoose the logical vocabulary employed in NLU/NLG so that it meshes\nsmoothly with both the planning operators and with the surface\nrealization schemas aimed at the target domain. (As a noteworthy\nexample of this genre, see Moore & Paris 1993.) In this way\ndomain and\ntext planning and surface realization become relatively\nstraightforward, at least in comparison with systems that attempt to\nsynthesize plans from scratch, or to reason extensively about the\nworld, the interlocutor, the context, and the best way to express an\nidea at the surface level. But while such an\napproach is entirely defensible for an experimental system intended to\nillustrate the role of plans and intentions in a specialized domain, it\nleaves open the question of how large amounts of linguistic knowledge\nand world knowledge could be incorporated into a dialogue system, and\nused inferentially in\nplanning communicative (and other) actions.\nAnother strategy for achieving more nearly practical performance has\nbeen to precode (and to some extent learn) more \u201creactive\u201d (as opposed\nto deliberative) ways of participating in dialogue. Reactive techniques\ninclude (i) formulaic, schema-based responses (reminiscent of ELIZA)\nwhere such responses are likely to be appropriate; (ii) rule-based\nintention and plan recognition; e.g.,\nan automated travel agent\nconfronted with the elliptical input \n\u201cFlights to Orlando\u201d can usually\nassume that the user wishes to be provided with flight options from the\nuser's current city to Orlando, in a time frame that may have been\nestablished previously; (iii) statistical domain plan recognition based\non probabilistic modeling of the sequences of steps typically taken in\npursuit of the goals characteristic of the domain; and (iv) discourse\nstate modeling by classifying speech acts (or utterance acts) and\ndialogue states into relatively small numbers of types, and viewing\ntransitions between dialogue states as events determined by the current\nstate and current type of speech act. For example, in a state where the\ndialogue system has no immediate obligation, and the user asks a\nquestion, the system assumes the obligation of answering the question,\nand transitions to a state where it will try to discharge that\nobligation.\nHowever, systems that rely primarily on reactive techniques tend to\nlack deep understanding and behavioral flexibility. Essentially,\nknowledge-based inference and planning are replaced by rote behavior,\nconditioned by miscellaneous features of the current discourse state\nand observations in the world. Furthermore, deliberate reasoning and\nplan synthesis seem necessary for an agent that can acquire effective\ngoal-directed plans and behaviors autonomously. Although random trial\nand error (as in reinforcement learning), supervised learning, and\nlearning by imitation are other learning options, their potential is\nlimited. Random trial and error is apt to be impractical in the\nenormously large state space of linguistic and commonsense behavior;\nsupervised learning (of appropriate choices based on contextual\nfeatures) seems at best able to induce rote plan recognition and\ndiscourse state transitions (reactive behaviors of types (iii) and\n(iv) above); and imitation is possible only when relevant, readily\nobservable exemplary behaviors can be presented to the\nlearner\u2014and by itself, it can lead only to rote, rather than\nreasoned, behavior.\nIntegrating reactive methods with deliberate reasoning and planning may\nbe enabled in future by treating intentions and actions arrived at by\nreactive methods as tentative, to be verified and potentially modified\nby more deliberate reasoning if time permits. Excessive reasoning\nwith iterated modalities could also be avoided with stronger\nassumptions about the attainment of mutual belief. For example,\nwe might assume that both speaker and hearer spontaneously perform\nforward inferences about the world and about each other's mental states\nbased on discourse events and common knowledge, and that such forward\ninferences directly become mutual knowledge (on a \u201clikemindedness\u201d\nassumption), thus shortcutting many modally nested inferences.\n",
