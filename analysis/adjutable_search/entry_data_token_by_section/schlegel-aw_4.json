    "main_text": "Philosophy of Art || Romantic Art and the Longing for a Lost Unity\n3.2 Romantic Art and the Longing for a Lost Unity\n\nTo be sure, if art is seen as the embodiment of an eternal truth, of\nabsolute beauty, this implies that art is not Beauty itself.\nThis is also why, according to Schlegel, each work of art is the\nexpression of a certain longing, a craving for the recreation of that\nvery unity experienced through the \u201cspiritual feeling or\nintuition (geistige Anschauung) of Nature\u201d (SW: III,\n307). For Schlegel, it is only through art and through everything that\nart signifies, that man is capable of attaining (even if not\nabsolutely) such a wholeness, i.e., to recover what is felt as a\n\u2018lost\u2019 unity. The idea of longing or Sehnsucht is\nindeed essential in Schlegel\u2019s account of Romanticism and must\nbe understood in relation to the difference between ancient and modern\nart, which also was the structuring principle and, in a sense,\nconstituted the real object of Schlegel\u2019s analysis in his\nLectures on Dramatic Art. This opposition may be summarized\nas follows: whereas ancient poetry is plastic, sensual, harmonious,\nand, overall, a poetry of enjoyment of the present; modern poetry is a\npoetry of desire and longing (Sehnsucht), hovering between\nthe idealizations of a remote past and an unknown future (LDA: 9).\nAccording to Schlegel, these differences encompass every sphere of\nreality and every form of art, and are on the whole the result of a\nhistorical event, namely the establishment of Christianity.\n\nAs F.W.J. Schelling had done in his Lectures on the Philosophy of\nArt of 1803, what Schlegel emphasizes about the transition from\npaganism to Christianity is that it involved the realization of an\ninsurmountable breach between subject and object, between the I and\nthe World, i.e., between consciousness and nature. Christianity, he\nargues, awakened the consciousness of the internal rupture or\nfundamental discord between the finite and the infinite which, in\nSchlegel\u2019s analysis, is constitutive of modernity. In other\nwords, for Schlegel, modernity arises from the painful realization of\nan insurmountable fissure, and the subsequent insight that real\nhappiness can never be attained, i.e., \u201cthat no external object\ncan ever entirely fill our souls; and that every mortal enjoyment is\nbut a fleeting and momentary deception\u201d (LDA: 9). As a result,\nin Schlegel\u2019s view, to understand modern and especially Romantic\nliterature means to understand art as the eternal longing for the\nreconciliation of this fissure between the subject and the universe,\nthe finite and the infinite or the divine. Both the realization of the\ninsurmountable fissure as well as the longing for its reconciliation\nare part of a particular way of experiencing nature, the self, and the\ninfinite.\n\nIn their attempts at finding alternative ways of understanding reason\nand its relation to life, art and feelings, the Romantics also tried\nto recuperate or rediscover elements from what had been regarded as\nthe irrational and mythical spirit of the Middle Ages. Schlegel uses\nthe term \u2018Romantic\u2019 to denote the very specific historical\nand stylistic discrepancy between German and Modern art, on the one\nhand, and Ancient and Classicist art, on the other. Schlegel argued\nthat German culture, which he defined as having a natural inclination\ntoward the Romantic (LDA: 439), was indebted to all the cultures which\npreceded it. But he specifically laid the roots of the so-called\n\u2018Romantic spirit\u2019 in chivalry, i.e., in the union of the\nheroism of the northern conquerors with the humanistic principles of\nChristianity. Schlegel associated chivalry and the Middle Ages in\ngeneral with a certain form of purity that manifests itself (1) in a\nmore spiritual understanding of love and female worth, to the extent\nthat one could talk of a fusion between the metaphysical longing for\nthe infinite (or God) and the erotic longing for a woman; and (2) in a\n\u2018heroic\u2019 morality. It is a morality \u201cthat never\ncalculated consequences, but consecrated unconditionally certain\nprinciples of action\u201d (LDA: 8). On the other hand, though,\nSchlegel\u2019s genealogy of the \u2018romantic\u2019 would be\nincomprehensible without paying attention to his openness to and\ninterest in other cultures and languages. Thus, the \u2018Romantic\nspirit\u2019 is also found in the works of Shakespeare, and sought in\nthe spirit of romance cultures and languages, which, for Schlegel, are\nthe result of a fusion between Latin and Teutonic languages, in a\nsimilar way as German Romanticism \u201cis the fruit of the union of\nthe peculiarities of the North with fragments of antiquity\u201d\n(LDA: 5).\n",
