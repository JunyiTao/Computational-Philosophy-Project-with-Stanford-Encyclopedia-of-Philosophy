This view requires that educational goods be\ndistributed solely in accordance with individual merit. In the context\nof education, merit is often measured by entrance requirements,\naptitude tests, or grades on exams. Of course, merit could be defined\nin some other way\u2014by how hard a student works, by how much a\nstudent improves, or by classroom participation, although all of these\nindicators pose measurement challenges.\n\nMeritocratic equality of opportunity has well-known limitations,\nespecially with respect to children. If educational opportunities\nshould be given to those who have the most merit in terms of the best\nscores on entrance tests, we will overlook the fact that merit is\nendogenous to education, which is to say, educational opportunity\nitself creates merit (Satz 2007). The more educational opportunities\nan individual child has, the more \u201cmerit\u201d that child may\ncome to have. This might suggest that we should pay more attention to\nindividuals\u2019 underlying potential rather than to their assessed\nmerit. Yet few people believe that we should give opportunities to\nthose who have the most underlying but uncultivated ability at the\nexpense of those who have less underlying ability or who are less\nqualified but have worked hard (Miller 1996).\n\nTo illustrate a second limitation with the meritocratic conception of\nequal educational opportunity, imagine that all highly selective\nuniversity places have been awarded to members of the upper class\nthrough cronyism, and that a progressive new government is suddenly\nelected into power to enforce meritocratic admissions. After\ngenerations of consolidating superior education, jobs and wealth at\nthe expense of the poor, the upper-classes are in a far better place,\nparticularly if private schooling is available, to ensure that their\nchildren end up being the most meritorious, thereby preserving vast\nsocial inequalities between members of different classes. Although\nsome opportunities are open to all equally, opportunities to develop\n\u201cmerit\u201d are not distributed equally (Williams 1962).\nIntergenerational transmission of opportunities to cultivate merit\nwould generate a deeply divided and unequal society, which is at odds\nwith the ideal of equality of educational opportunity.\n\nTwo further limitations concerning meritocratic equality of\nopportunity in the context of education are worth noting, aside from\nthe possible toxic consequences of engaging in meritocratic rhetoric\n(Young 1958; Sandel 2020). The first, as has already been mentioned,\nis that the definition of merit itself can be contentious. Is there an\naccount of merit that is wholly independent of conceptions of justice\n(Sen 2000)? Is merit simply what maximizes productivity? Should merit\nbe based solely on test scores or also take into account moral\nattributes like the ability to work cooperatively with others?\n\nThe second is that while conditioning educational opportunities on\n\u201cmerit\u201d may look compelling when dealing with young\nadults, it is deeply problematic when applied to very young children.\nAs Michael Walzer (1983: 203) notes, the job of the reading teacher is\nto teach children to read, not merely to offer the opportunity to\nlearn to read. And this job presumably includes all children in a\nclassroom\u2014even those who are not especially\n\u201cmeritorious\u201d. Perhaps this is also why the educational\n\u201ctracking\u201d of very young children on the basis of ability\nseems especially objectionable\u2014there are certain capacities that\nneed to be cultivated in all children (Satz 2007).\n",
