    "main_text": "Background || Critical Theory\n1.1 Critical Theory\n\nCritical disability theory is able to challenge traditional disability\nstudies and engage in transformative, intersectional, and coalitional\ncritical work (Ellis et al. 2018). This is thanks in part to its\nheritage in the critical theory of the Frankfurt School and especially\nthe influence of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer (Burghardt 2011: 3:\nMeekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 51\u201352). Broadly understood,\ncritical theory identifies, describes, and analyzes the subsumed or\nhidden origins of social and political culture, discourses, and\ninstitutions. In these ways, critical theory also exposes the\ncontingency of ideas or circumstances often presumed natural or\nunchangeable. Diverse critical theories unite in the sense that they\ntarget ideology, distrust appearances, and often point out false\nconsciousness. Critical disability theory thus allies itself with\nContinental philosophical methods, including phenomenology, Freudian\npsychoanalysis, and neo-Marxist approaches (Kearney & Rainwater\n1996: 195). Continental philosophy involves a widespread rejection of\nmeaning narrowly rooted in science, and it responds to the crisis of\nthe collapse of meaning and temptation to nihilism in modernity\ngenerally (Kearney 1986: 2). Under this umbrella, critical theory\nfinds that meaning has social origins, often from \u201chistorical\nstrategies of domination and liberation\u201d; therefore, critical\ntheory is interested in \u201cthe social relation of the human\nsubject to the historical conditions of production or\nalienation\u201d (Kearney 1986: 2; see the entry on\n critical theory).\n\nCritical disability theory is committed to praxis and inquiry that\ninvolve \u201cin-depth analysis of the structural and as-yet\nincompletely understood psychic underpinnings of oppression\u201d\n(Burghardt 2011: 13). In this way, the critical theory of the\nFrankfurt School is a necessary ingredient to its work. Madeline\nBurghardt writes, \n\n\nCritical theory challenges cultural discursive institutions which\nundergird viable practices of exclusion and misrepresentation, and\nthus offers a map toward greater understanding and informed challenge.\nAt its core, critical theory insists that we remain attentive to\n\u201cthe human bottom of non-human things\u201d (Horkheimer 1972:\nxiii), suggesting an ongoing commitment to the lives implicated in\ncultural and political practices. (2011: 13)\n\n\nFor Helen Meekosha and Russell Shuttleworth, critical disability\ntheory necessarily includes four primary principles, as follows (2009:\n52). First, \u201ccritical social theory is irreducible to\nfacts\u201d, meaning that the methods of such a theory outstrip\nquantitative analysis and reject reduction to the quantitative;\nfurther, such theory rejects \u201catheoretical, context-free\nscience\u201d, claiming that such science is an inappropriate way to\naccess phenomena under analysis (2009: 52; see also Samuels 2014).\nSecond, \u201ccritical social theory links theory with praxis in the\nstruggle for an autonomous and participatory society\u201d (2009:\n52). This praxis involves viewing autonomy as \u201cemancipation from\nhegemonic and hierarchical ideologies\u201d rather than reducing\nautonomy to independence, as was common in disability theorizing in\nthe 1970s\u20131990s (2009: 52\u201353). Third, \u201ccritical\nsocial theory is self-aware of its historicity\u201d, meaning that it\nsees its own work as embedded within a time and place, reflexively\ntargeting itself with the historical analysis it applies to social\nstructures and institutions (2009: 53\u201354). Fourth,\n\u201ccritical social theory engages in dialogue among\ncultures\u201d; on this point, Meekosha and Shuttleworth \u201ccall\nfor an explicit dialogue with human rights and emancipatory thinking\nfrom the diversity of cultures\u201d and hope to avoid\n\u201cprojecting an international ideal\u201d from Western to\nnon-Western cultures (2009: 54).\n\nThe framing of critical disability theory within critical theory\npartially sets its agenda and opens out to fresh methodologies. For\nexample, critical theory acts as a hinge between critical disability\ntheory and feminist theory and can drive an integrated\nfeminist-disability analysis (Garland-Thomson 2002). Rosemarie\nGarland-Thomson\u2019s feminist-disability analysis engages\n\u201cseveral fundamental premises of critical theory\u201d,\nincluding these: representation structures reality; the margins define\nthe center; gender and disability are ways of signifying relationships\nof power; human identity is multiple and unstable; and all analysis\nand evaluation has political implications (2002: 6). Along these\nlines, Garland-Thomson writes, \n\n\nDisability\u2014like gender\u2014is a concept that pervades all\naspects of culture: its structuring institutions, social identities,\ncultural practices, political positions, historical communities, and\nthe shared human experience of embodiment. (2002: 4) \n\n\nIn this way, disability and ability are fundamentally\n\u201cproduced\u201d rather than discovered; this production occurs\nthrough a \u201cdisability/ability system\u201d. Disability\ntheorists can employ this system as a category of analysis to help\n\u201cdenaturalize\u201d disability (2002: 6). Similarly, Sami\nSchalk argues, \n\n\nby designating (dis)ability as a system of social norms which\ncategorizes, ranks, and values bodyminds and disability as a\nhistorically and culturally variable category within this larger\nsystem, critical disability studies can better engage in conversations\nabout the ways both ability and disability operate. (2017)\n\n\nThe benefits of critical disability theory, however, do not merely\naccrue to the study of disability. Critical disability theory offers\ncrucial resources to other analyses, including but not limited to\nthose conducted in feminist philosophy and philosophy more generally.\nFeminist theory needs disability analysis in order to achieve its own\ngoals, and, again, it is best to unite the two through common critical\ntheory strategies (Garland-Thomson 2002: 2\u20133). For\nGarland-Thomson, without disability analysis, feminism cannot\ncritically tackle problems like infanticide, selective abortion,\neugenic programs, coercive rehabilitation, genocide, and normalizing\nsurgical procedures, among other phenomena (2002: 9). Meanwhile,\nShelley Tremain demonstrates that feminist philosophy\u2019s\nconceptual work on \u201cessentialism and constructivism, identity,\nrace, sexuality, agency, experience, and oppression\u201d is\nfurthered through the development of a feminist philosophy of\ndisability, as disability analysis aids in debates over these terms\n(2015: 8).\n\nFurther, critical disability theory contributes to philosophy in a\nbroad range of ways. Critical disability theory challenges the\nmarginalization of the study of disability and its ghettoization\nwithin bioethics (and its circumscription, thereby, to the medical\nmodel) (Tremain 2017). As Tremain argues, disability matters to core\ndebates in philosophy. Specifically, philosophy of disability, as one\nform critical disability theory can take, contributes to central\nphilosophical puzzles, including debates over relativism, materialism,\nrealism, and determinism (2015).\n\nCritical disability theory is significantly aimed toward exposing and\nanalyzing ableism. Ableism is, minimally, discrimination on the basis\nof ability, perceived or actual (Campbell 2009: 5). Ableism as a\nprejudicial attitude prefers and prioritizes the features of the empty\nsubject Garland-Thomson refers to as the \u201cnormate\u201d while\nsystematically excluding the abnormal or non-normative embodied minds\n(1996: 9). But, critical disability thinking situates it maximally as\na set of primary social and political structures that marginalize,\norganize and rank subjects and objects, shapes discourse, and\nundergirds institutions. Ableism is \n\n\na network of beliefs, processes and practices that produces a\nparticular kind of self and body (the corporeal standard) that is\nprojected as the perfect, species-typical and therefore essential and\nfully human. Disability then is cast as a diminished state of being\nhuman. (Campbell 2001: 44) \n\n\nAbleism systematically interacts with other power structures that\nstigmatize to produce race, gender, sex, and disability. Ableism\nshapes our world and produces disability; \n\n\nregimes of ableism have produced a depth of disability negation that\nreaches into the caverns of collective subjectivity to the extent that\nthe notion of disability as inherently negative is seen as a\n\u2018naturalized\u2019 reaction to an aberration. (Campbell 2009:\n166) \n\n\nSome refer to this social and political structure as disablism or use\nthe terms interchangeably (Campbell 2009: 5 and Goodley 2014).\n\nAbleism and resistance to ableism is central to the tradition of\ncritical disability theory (Campbell 2008b). To conceive of its\nimportance, consider the parallel to racism: racism and anti-racist\nwork is a necessary and indisputable part of the tradition of critical\nrace theory, regardless of how racism is understood and framed. But,\nit would be wrong to consider ableism as an additive to sexism and\nracism. Instead, theorizing ableism is part of a \u201ccritique of\nthe dominant order, the other, or alterity\u201d (Goodley 2009).\nTheorizing ableism is urgent (Wolbring 2008).\n\nA core conception of ableism at work in everyday life is behind most,\nif not all, work in critical disability theory. Landmark texts in\ncritical disability theory treating ableism directly include Fiona\nKumari Campbell\u2019s work, which brings together politics, law, and\nculture to mark out and establish an expansive reading of ableism and\ndescribe its \u201cproduction, operation, and maintenance\u201d\n(2009: 4). Ableism erases disability, as \u201cableistnormativity\nresults in compulsive passing, wherein there is a failure to ask about\ndifference, to imagine human be-ingness differently\u201d (2009: 4).\nCampbell theorizes the false consciousness of internalized ableism\n(2008a). Jennifer Scuro analyzes ableism and brings its impacts to the\nfore to rethink neoliberalism and link the two together (2017).\n\nTheorists have recently used ableism to interrogate what disability\nis, including cognitive disability (Carlson 2001), how ableism works\ntogether with and produces race (Campbell 2008a), the ableism of the concept of\nresilience (Hutcheon & Wolbring 2013), questions of epistemic\nresponsibility (Reynolds 2016a), sexuality (Baril & Trevenen\n2014), and a critical theory of harm (Reynolds 2016b). Meanwhile an\nableist lens has been brought to the discipline and practice of\nacademia (Dolmage 2017; Wolbring 2012).\n\nThe denaturalization of disability is a key task of critical\ndisability theory, in line with its critical heritage (e.g., Tremain\n2017: 33 and 86). This work includes challenging the distinction\nbetween impairment and disability, common in more traditional\ndisability studies, which sets aside impairment as natural and\ndisability as socially constructed (Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009,\n50; Tremain 2017: 93, 115). Indeed, Tremain argues that impairment\nitself is socially constructed (2001). Denaturalizing disability and\nimpairment are part of the analysis, politicization, and\nintersectional understanding of disability sought by critical\ndisability theorists.\n\nNirmala Erevelles sounds a word of warning with regard to alliances\nacross critical theories, citing Sharon Snyder and David\nMitchell\u2019s concept of narrative prosthesis, whereby fiction\nwriters use disability to further plot. She worries that \n\n\nsomething similar happens in critical theory\u2014where, for example,\nDeaf/disability studies likens disability experiences to that of race,\nwhile race theorists describe their own oppression as disability. In\neach case, rather than interrogate the relationship, each group\nborrows the other\u2019s oppressive associations in an attempt to\nexplain its own oppression. (Erevelles and Kafer 2010: 217) \n\n\nAnalysis in critical disability studies hopes to move beyond the\nborrowing of oppressive associations to describe the intimate\nrelationships among systems of oppression.\n",
