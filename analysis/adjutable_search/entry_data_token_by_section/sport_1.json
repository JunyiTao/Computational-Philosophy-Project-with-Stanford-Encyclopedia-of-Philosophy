    "main_text": "Introduction || History of the Philosophy of Sport\n1.2 History of the Philosophy of Sport\n\n\nThe philosophy of sport was pre-dated and inspired by the philosophy\nof play, most notably Johan Huizinga\u2019s Homo Ludens\n(1938). However, sport is a distinctive type of play and not every\ninstance of sport is an instance of play (Suits, 1988), so sport\nrequires independent philosophical analysis. In the philosophy of sport\nliterature, myriad characterizations and definitions of the nature and\nscope of the field have been proffered (Torres, 2014, 4\u20135). For Paul\nWeiss, the philosophy of sport provides an \u2018examination of sport\nin terms of principles which are to be at once revelatory of the nature\nof sport and pertinent to other fields \u2013 indeed, to the whole of\nthings and knowledge\u2019 (Weiss, 1971, vii-viii). According to\nRobert G. Osterhoudt, first editor of the Journal of the Philosophy\nof Sport, this branch of Philosophy is committed \u2018to\nthe presentation of genuinely philosophical examinations, or reflective\nauthentic examinations of the nature of sport \u2026 and systematic\ndiscussions of issues peculiar to sport until they are reduced to\nmatters of a distinctly philosophical order\u2019 (Osterhoudt, 1973,\nix\u2013xi).\n\n\nR. Scott Kretchmar (1997) has suggested that, from the 1870s to the\n1990s, the philosophy of sport evolved from being a sub-branch of the\nphilosophy of education to being a field of study in its own right.\nDuring this time, the field went through three phases: the\n\u2018eclectic\u2019 phase, the \u2018system-based\u2019 phase and\nthe \u2018disciplinary\u2019 phase. In the eclectic phase, also\nreferred to as \u2018philosophy-of-education period,\u2019\nphilosophies of education laid the ground for the philosophical study\nof sport. Challenging the dominant intellectualist pedagogical\ntradition, philosophers such as William James, Edward L. Thorndike, and\nJohn Dewey emphasized the value of play, games, and sport in preparing\nhuman beings for achieving good lives. Physical educators Thomas D.\nWood and Clark Hetherington, among others, built upon these\nphilosophers to develop what was called \u2018The New Physical\nEducation,\u2019 a pedagogical movement aimed at showing that physical\neducation should become an integral part of overall human education.\nThese educators, despite contributing little to philosophical\ndiscussion, helped to generate an era where physical education was\nrequired in most educational programs.\n\n\nIn the \u2018system-based period,\u2019 pedagogical concerns\nmotivated the philosophical analysis of sport and physical exercise.\nHowever, the protagonists of this phase, such as Elwood Craig David and\nEarle Ziegler, relied on a method that placed greater weight on\nphilosophical modes of analysis. They began by describing and comparing\ndifferent philosophical systems, distilled them to the basic concepts\nand positions that related to physical education, and finished by\ndrawing practical implications and pedagogical recommendations. Their\nemphasis on philosophical systems created a fertile ground for the\ndevelopment of the philosophy of sport. As William J. Morgan (2000,\n205) notes, this shift in emphasis led to the progressive displacement\nof science and pedagogy as the main pillars of physical education\ncurricula, and it facilitated a broader approach to the study of\nphysical exercise and sport that gave pride of place to cultural and\nhistorical dimensions. \n\n\nThis evolution within physical education departments during the\n\u2018disciplinary phase\u2019 facilitated the emergence of the\nphilosophy of sport as a discipline in its own right. The Philosophic\nSociety for the Study of Sport (PSSS) was formed during the celebration\nof the 1972 Eastern Division conference of the American Philosophical\nAssociation (APA) in Boston; the organization\u2019s name was changed\nto International Association for the Philosophy of Sport (IAPS) in\n1999. The Society founded a scholarly journal, the Journal of the\nPhilosophy of Sport (JPS), and established that the mission of the\nSociety and the Journal was \u2018to foster interchange and\nscholarship among those interested in the scholarly study of\nsport\u2019 (Fraleigh 1983: 6). Weiss\u2019 contribution to the formation\nof the discipline in its early stages was crucial. With the publication\nof Sport: A Philosophic Inquiry in 1969, Weiss, a philosopher\nof international repute, demonstrated that sport provided a fertile\nground for philosophical inquiry. Along with Weiss, other pioneers of\nthe philosophical analysis of sport were Eleanor Metheny (1952, 1965)\nand Howard S. Slusher (1967), who also helped to consolidate the\nnascent sub-discipline by publishing monographs in the philosophy of\nsport. \n\n\nEarly philosophy of sport divided along \u2018analytic\u2019 and\n\u2018continental\u2019 lines. Klaus V. Meier (1988), Bernard Suits\n(1977), and Frank McBride (1975, 1979) focused on the possibility of\nproviding individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for\nsomething to be a \u2018sport\u2019. They drew on tools from\nanalytical philosophy to analyse the use of the term\n\u2018sport\u2019 (in both plain and academic language) and to\nattempt to identify traits common to all sports. Early philosophers of\nsport also examined sport phenomenologically. R. Scott Kretchmar, Drew\nH. Hyland, and Robert G. Osterhoudt, among others, drew on the works of\nEugene Fink, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Georg W. F. Hegel, Martin\nHeidegger, and Edmund Husserl to study the nature of sport by focusing\non the lived experiences of those individuals engaged in it.\n\n\nMore recently, the philosophy of sport has transitioned into a\n\u2018hermeneutic\u2019 or \u2018applied philosophy\u2019 phase\n(Lopez Frias, 2017; McNamee, 2007). The field took a\n\u2018practical\u2019 turn in the 1990s.  The work of Alasdair\nMacIntyre, especially his seminal work After Virtue (1984),\nplayed a key role in this shift among philosophers of sport towards\nnormative issues. Drawing on MacIntyre\u2019s concept of\n\u2018social practice,\u2019 philosophers of sport aimed to identify\nthe intrinsic goods and excellences of sport in order to assess and\ncritique sport and related ethical issues such as doping, cheating,\nand sportsmanship.\n\n\nClassic debates concerning the nature of sport and the phenomenology\nof participants\u2019 experience have not been abandoned, however. As we\nwill show later (section 2.1), the debate on the nature of sport\nremains central. Indeed, the rise of electronic games (so-called\n\u2018eSports\u2019) has reignited discussion of the defining\nelements of sport and, more broadly, the contrast between traditional\ngames and digital games (Conway, 2016). In particular, philosophers\nof sport have explored the question of whether eSports test physical\nskills (Van Hilvoorde, 2017; Holt, 2016), the implications of the\ninstitutionalization of eSport competitions (Hemphill, 2005; Parry,\n2018), and moral engagement in digital gaming (Edgar, 2016). \n\n\nStill more prominent is the phenomenology of sport. The rapid\nprogression of computational science and neuroscience has had a\nprofound influence in the philosophy of sport, encouraging exponential\ngrowth in publications concerning skill acquisition in sport\n(Ilund\u00e1in-Agurruza, 2016), the mind-body relationship (Gerber\nand Morgan, 1979), and sport experience (Breivik, 2014). The aesthetics\nof sport has also flourished in recent decades by focusing on two\nthemes (Edgar, 2014): the nature and relevance of aesthetic qualities\n(e.g. beauty, ugliness, grace, and strength) to the experience of\npractising and watching sport (see also Kreft, 2012; Lacerda and\nMumford, 2010; Lacerda, 2012) and the consideration of sport as an art\nand its relationship to art (see also Best, 1974, 1985; Elcombe, 2012;\nGaffney, 2013). So, while still an emergent field, the philosophy of\nsport has progressed quickly in developing central methods and\npreoccupations.\n",
