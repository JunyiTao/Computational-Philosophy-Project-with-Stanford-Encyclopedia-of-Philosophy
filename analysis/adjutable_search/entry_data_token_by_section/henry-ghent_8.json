    "main_text": "Analogy\n9. Analogy\n\n\nThe last aspect is clarified particularly in q. 2, art. 21 of the\nSumma, in which Henry deals with the theme of the relation\nbetween the being of creatures and the being of the creator.\n\n\nAccording to Henry, there is no real community, within creatural\nbeing, between substantial being and accidental being; as a\nconsequence, given that the distance between God\u2019s being and\ncreatures\u2019 being is much greater than the difference between the being\nof substance and that of accidents, being cannot be something common\nto both God and creatures. When being is predicated of God and\ncreatures, this only happens on the basis of the community of the\nname, and not of a real community: we are not dealing therefore with a\nunivocal predication, nor we are dealing with a purely equivocal\npredication, but with an intermediate, that is analogical,\npredication, one in which the term \u2018being\u2019 primarily and directly\nrelates to God, and only in a secondary way to creatures, since the\nlatter derive their being from God.\n\n\nThe analogy between God and creatures must be distinguished from the\nanalogical relation between substance and accident within the same\ncreatural being: while other beings relate to substance as their\nsubject, all creatures relate to God as to their end, their form (that\nis, as to the cause of their esse essentiae), and their\nefficient principle (that is, as to the cause of their esse\nactualis existentiae). Consequently, according to Henry, every\nreal concept through which the being of something is conceived without\nany further qualification (simpliciter), always refers to\nGod\u2019s being or to creatures\u2019 being, and never to something common to\nboth.\n\n\nYet Henry adds in this regard that those who have not been able to\ndistinguish among the many meanings of being (as instead Aristotle\ncorrectly did), and have rather understood being as one genus (as\nPlato did), held that the name \u2018being\u2019 referred to a single and common\nconcept. Univocity is therefore, according to Henry, a mistake, the\norigin of which lies in the indeterminacy of the concept of being\nwhich is first known by the intellect. In actual fact, as mentioned\nabove, indeterminacy is twofold, and points to something completely\ndifferent in the case of God\u2019s being (negative indeterminacy, which\nexcludes any possible determination in act and in potency) and in the\ncase of creatural being (privative indeterminacy, which excludes only\nany actual determination). Since, however, these two kinds may appear\nsimilar, those who are unable to perceive their difference conceive as\none and the same thing indeterminate being, whether it is taken in the\nfirst or in the second meaning, that is, whether it is proper to God\nor to the general concept of being. This univocal concept is therefore\na mistake, or an error, because nothing positive is really common to\nGod and creatures, but only something negative, as the \u2018right\u2019\nintellect subsequently acknowledges, when, going beyond the apparent\ninitial indistinctness, it conceives in a distinct, separate way\nnegatively indeterminate being and privatively indeterminate\nbeing.\n\n\nHenry\u2019s latter precision remains nonetheless ambiguous: the fact that\nthe \u2018right\u2019 intellect (rectus intellectus) can make a\ndistinction between the two kinds of indeterminacy only \u2018subsequently\u2019\n(consequenter; f. 125rS) suggests that the initial confusion\nis not only a mistake of the upholders of the univocity of being, but\na kind of deviation or temptation of the human intellect, especially\nif we consider that, in conceiving any determinate being, our\nintellect always conceives, at a more general level, indeterminate\nbeing, and within the latter, in a more original way, negatively\nindeterminate being (see above, \u00a7 8). Thus, in other texts (such as in\nthe following q. 3 of the same art. 21 of the Summa, where\nHenry is in actual fact citing Avicenna), Henry speaks of a common,\nanalogous concept of being, giving the impression of bringing analogy\ncloser to univocity. The first concept of being (ens largissimo\nmodo acceptum) is \u201csomething analogous common to Creator and\ncreature, containing within itself being as principle and being as\nproduced\u201d (\u201ccommune analogum ad creatorem et creaturam, continens sub\nse ens principium et ens principiatum\u201d, Summa, art. 21, q. 3,\ned. 1520, I, f. 126rD; my interpretation here differs somewhat from\nthat of Pickav\u00e9, who separates the question of analogy from that of\nthe first object of knowing by suggesting that the distinction between\nwhat is negatively indeterminate and what is privatively indeterminate\nhas a different meaning and function in the two cases. Concerning the\nconfusion between the two kinds of indeterminacy, Pickav\u00e9 prefers to\nspeak of \u2018weakness\u2019, instead of \u2018mistake\u2019 or \u2018error\u2019; see Pickav\u00e9\n2011a). This concept at first common to God and creatures (whether it\nis erroneously conceived as something positive, or correctly conceived\nas something negative) offers, at any rate, the only possible starting\npoint for a metaphysical demonstration of the existence of God, a\ndemonstration that, in appealing to Avicenna and to Augustine's De\nTrinitate, proceeds from the consideration of any determinate\nbeing or good to the distinct knowledge of God as pure, necessarily\nexisting Being (Summa, art. 22, q. 5; art. 24, q. 6).  Henry\ndoes not refrain, however, from presenting a posteriori\nproofs \u2014 in the order of efficient, formal and final causes\n\u2014 that nevertheless refer exclusively to the existence of\nGod de complexo; in other words, to the truth of the\nstatement \u201cGod exists\u201d (Summa, art. 22,\nq. 4).\n",
