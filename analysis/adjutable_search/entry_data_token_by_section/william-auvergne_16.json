This doctrine,\nwhich was popular among Franciscan thinkers, holds that the body of a\nhuman being is informed not just by a single soul, the rational soul,\nbut also by a vegetative and a sensitive soul. This multiplicity of\nsouls, it is held, serves to explain how human beings have the vital\noperations characteristic of plants and animals in addition to\npeculiarly human ones, and also explains the development of the\nfetus\u2019s vital functions. Against this doctrine, William claims\nto have shown earlier in On the Soul that not only the\noperation of understanding, but also the sensitive operations of\nseeing and hearing \u201care essential and proper to the soul\nitself\u201d (OO II suppl., 108b; Teske 2000, 164) and \u201chence,\nit cannot be denied except through insanity that one and the same soul\ncarries out such operations.\u201d Rather than posit a multiplicity\nof souls, William holds that higher souls incorporate the kinds of\noperations attributed to lower ones. The rational soul is infused into\nthe body directly by God when the fetus reaches a suitable stage of\norganization, and the prior animal or sensitive soul in the fetus\nceases to be. In this case too a view along similar lines was to be\ndeveloped by Aquinas.\n\nScholars have noted, however, that while William rejects a plurality\nof souls in the human body, he does subscribe to a version of the\ndoctrine of a plurality of substantial forms in the sense that he\ntreats the human body as itself a substance independent of its\nassociation with the soul, and hence having its own corporeal form,\nwhile also being informed by the human or rational soul, which renders\nit a living thing.
