    "main_text": "Foundational Theories of Meaning || Non-Mentalist Theories\n3.2 Non-Mentalist Theories\n\nAs noted above, not all foundational theories of meaning attempt to\nexplain meaning in terms of mental content. One might be inclined to\npursue a non-mentalist foundational theory of meaning for a number of\nreasons; for example, one might be skeptical about the mentalist\ntheories on offer; one might think that mental representation should\nbe analyzed in terms of linguistic representation, rather than the\nother way around; or one might think that representation should be\nanalyzable in non-representational terms, and doubt whether there is\nany true explanation of mental representation suitable to accompany a\nmentalist reduction of meaning to mental representation.\n\nTo give a non-mentalist foundational theory of meaning is to say which\naspects of the use of an expression determine\nmeaning\u2014and do so without taking that expression to simply\ninherit its content from some more fundamental bearer of content. In\nwhat follows I\u2019ll briefly discuss some of the aspects of the use\nof expressions which proponents of non-mentalist theories have taken\nto explain their meanings.\n3.2.1 Causal origin\n\nIn Naming and Necessity, Kripke suggested that the reference\nof a name could be explained in terms of the history of use of that\nname, rather than by descriptions associated with that name by its\nusers. In the standard case, Kripke thought, the right explanation of\nthe reference of a name could be divided into an explanation of the\nname\u2019s introduction as name for this or that\u2014an\nevent of \u201cbaptism\u201d\u2014and its successful\ntransmission from one speaker to another.\n\nOne approach to the theory of meaning is to extend Kripke\u2019s\nremarks in two ways: first, by suggesting that they might serve as an\naccount of meaning, as well as\n reference;[6]\n and second, by extending them to parts of speech other than names.\n(See, for discussion, Devitt 1981.) In this way, we might aim to\nexplain the meanings of expressions in terms of their causal\norigin.\n\nWhile causal theories don\u2019t take expressions to simply inherit\ntheir contents from mental states, it is plausible that they should\nstill give mental states an important role to play in explaining\nmeaning. For example, it is plausible that introducing a term involves\nintending that it stand for some object or property, and that\ntransmission of a term from one speaker to another involves the latter\nintending to use it in the same way as the former.\n\nThere are two standard problems for causal theories of this sort\n(whether they are elaborated in a mentalist or a non-mentalist way).\nThe first is the problem of extending the theory from the case of\nnames to to other sorts of vocabulary for which the theory seems less\nnatural. Examples which have seemed to many to be problematic are\nempty names and non-referring theoretical terms, logical vocabulary,\nand predicates which, because their content does not seem closely\nrelated to the properties represented in perceptual experience, are\nnot intuitively linked to any initial act of \u201cbaptism\u201d.\nThe second problem, which is sometimes called the \u201cqua\nproblem\u201d, is the problem of explaining which of the many causes\nof a term\u2019s introduction should determine its content. Suppose\nthat the term \u201cwater\u201d was introduced in the presence of a\nbody of H2O. What made it a term for this substance, rather\nthan for liquid in general, or colorless liquid, or colorless liquid\nin the region of the term's introduction? The proponent of a causal\ntheory owes some answer to this question; see for discussion Devitt\nand Sterelny (1987).\n\nFor a classic discussion of the prospects of causal theories, see\nEvans (1973). For a\nrecent theory which makes causal origin part but not all of the story,\nsee Dickie (2015).\n3.2.2 Truth-maximization and the principle of charity\n\nCausal theories aim to explain meaning in terms of the relations\nbetween expressions and the objects and properties they represent. A\nvery different sort of foundational theory of meaning which maintains\nthis emphasis on the relations between expressions and the world gives\na central role to a principle of charity which holds that\n(modulo some qualifications) the right assignment of meanings to the\nexpression of a subject\u2019s language is that assignment of\nmeanings which maximizes the truth of the subject\u2019s\nutterances.\n\nAn influential proponent of this sort of view was Donald Davidson, who\nstated the motivation for the view as follows:\n\n\nA central source of trouble is the way beliefs and meanings conspire\nto account for utterances. A speaker who holds a sentence to be true\non an occasion does so in part because of what he means, or would\nmean, by an utterance of that sentence, and in part because of what he\nbelieves. If all we have to go on is the fact of honest utterance, we\ncannot infer the belief without knowing the meaning, and have no\nchance of inferring the meaning without the belief. (Davidson 1974a:\n314; see also Davidson 1973)\n\n\nDavidson\u2019s idea was that attempts to state the facts in virtue\nof which expressions have a certain meaning for a subject face a kind\nof dilemma: if we had an independent account of what it is for an\nagent to have a belief with a certain content, we could ascend from\nthere to an account of what it is for a sentence to have a meaning; if\nwe had an independent account of what it is for a sentence to have a\nmeaning, we could ascend from there to an account of what it is for an\nagent to have a belief with a certain content; but in fact neither\nsort of independent account is available, because many assignments of\nbeliefs and meanings are consistent with the subject\u2019s\nlinguistic behavior. Davidson\u2019s solution to this dilemma is that\nwe must define belief and meaning together, in terms of an independent\nthird fact: the fact that the beliefs of an agent, and the meanings of\nher words, are whatever they must be in order to maximize the truth of\nher beliefs and utterances.\n\nBy tying meaning and belief to truth, this sort of foundational theory\nof meaning implies that it is impossible for anyone who speaks a\nmeaningful language to be radically mistaken about the nature of the\nworld; and this implies that certain levels of radical disagreement\nbetween a pair of speakers or communities will also be impossible\n(since the beliefs of each community must be, by and large, true).\nThis is a consequence of the view which Davidson embraced (see\nDavidson 1974b); but one might also reasonably think that radical\ndisagreement, as well as radical error, are possible, and hence that\nany theory, like Davidson\u2019s, which implies that they are\nimpossible must be mistaken.\n\nA different sort of worry about a theory of this sort is that the\nrequirement that we maximize the truth of the utterances of subjects\nhardly seems sufficient to determine the meanings of the expressions\nof their language. It seems plausible, offhand, that there will be\nmany different interpretations of a subject\u2019s language which\nwill be tied on the measure of truth-maximization; one way to see the\nforce of this sort of worry is to recall the point, familiar from our\ndiscussion of possible worlds semantics in\n \u00a72.1.5\n above, that a pair of sentences can be true in exactly the same\ncircumstances and yet differ in meaning. One worry is thus that a\ntheory of Davidson\u2019s sort will entail an implausible\nindeterminacy of meaning. For Davidson\u2019s fullest attempt to\nanswer this sort of worry, see Chapter 3 of Davidson (2005).\n3.2.3 Reference magnetism\n\nA different sort of theory emerges from a further objection to the\nsort of theory discussed in the previous section. This objection is\nbased on Hilary Putnam\u2019s (1980, 1981) model-theoretic argument.\nThis argument aimed to show that there are very many different\nassignments of reference to subsentential expressions of our language\nwhich make all of our utterances true. (For details on how the\nargument works, see the entry on\n Skolem\u2019s paradox,\n especially \u00a73.4.) Putnam\u2019s argument therefore leaves us\nwith a choice between two options: either we must accept that there\nare no facts of the matter about what any of our expressions refer to,\nor we must deny that is determined solely by a principle of\ntruth-maximization.\n\nMost philosophers take the second option. Doing so, however,\ndoesn\u2019t mean that something like the principle of charity\ncan\u2019t still be part of our foundational theory of meaning.\n\nDavid Lewis (1983, 1984) gave a version of this kind of response,\nwhich he credits to Merrill (1980), and which has since been quite\ninfluential. His idea was that the assignment of contents to\nexpressions of our language is fixed, not just by the constraint that\nthe right interpretation will maximize the truth of our utterances,\nbut by picking the interpretation which does best at jointly\nsatisfying the constraints of truth-maximization and the constraint\nthat the referents of our terms should, as much as possible, be\n\u201cthe ones that respect the objective joints in nature\u201d\n(1984: 227).\n\nSuch entities are often said to be more \u201celigible\u201d to be\nthe referents of expressions than others. An approach to the\nfoundations of meaning based on the twin principles of charity +\neligibility has some claim to being the most widely held view today.\nSee Sider (2011) for an influential extension of the Lewisian\nstrategy.\n\nLewis\u2019 solution to Putnam\u2019s problem comes with a\nnon-trivial metaphysical price tag: recognition of an objective graded\ndistinction between more and less natural properties. Some have found\nthe price too much to pay, and have sought other approaches to the\nfoundational theory of meaning. But even if we recognize in our\nmetaphysics a distinction between properties which are\n\u201cjoint-carving\u201d and those which are not, we might still\ndoubt whether this distinction can remedy the sorts of indeterminacy\nproblems which plague foundational theories based solely on the\nprinciple of charity. For doubts along these lines, see Hawthorne\n(2007).\n3.2.4 Regularities in use\n\nA different way to develop a non-mentalist foundational theory of\nmeaning focuses less on relations between subsentential expressions or\nsentences and bits of non-linguistic reality and more on the\nregularities which govern our use of language. Views of this sort have\nbeen defended by a number of authors; this section focuses on the\nversion of the view developed in Horwich (1998, 2005).\n\nHorwich\u2019s core idea is that our acceptance of sentences is\ngoverned by certain laws, and, in the case of non-ambiguous\nexpressions, there is a single \u201cacceptance regularity\u201d\nwhich explains all of our uses of the expression. The type of\nacceptance regularity which is relevant will vary depending on the\nsort of expression whose meaning is being explained. For example, our\nuse of a perceptual term like \u201cred\u201d might be best\nexplained by the following acceptance regularity:\n\n\nThe disposition to accept \u201cthat is red\u201d in response to the\nsort of visual experience normally provoked by a red surface.\n\n\nwhereas, in the case of a logical term like \u201cand\u201d, the\nacceptance regularity will involve dispositions to accept inferences\ninvolving pairs of sentences rather than dispositions to respond to\nparticular sorts of experiences:\n\n\nThe disposition to accept the two-way argument schema \u201cp,\nq // p and q\u201d.\n\n\nAs these examples illustrate, it is plausible that a strength of a\nview like Horwich\u2019s is its ability to handle expressions of\ndifferent categories.\n\nLike its competitors, Horwich\u2019s theory is also open to some\nobjections. One might worry that his use of the sentential attitude of\nacceptance entails a lapse into mentalism, if acceptance either just\nis, or is analyzed in terms of, beliefs. There is also a\nworry\u2014which affects other \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cconceptual\nrole\u201d or \u201cfunctional role\u201d theories of\nmeaning\u2014that Horwich\u2019s account implies the existence of\ndifferences in meaning which do not exist; it seems, for example, that\ntwo people\u2019s use of some term might be explained by distinct\nbasic acceptance regularities without their meaning different things\nby that term. Schiffer (2000) discusses the example of\n\u201cdog\u201d, and the differences between the basic acceptance\nregularities which govern the use of the term for the blind, the\nbiologically unsophisticated, and people acquainted only with certain\nsorts of\n dogs.[7]\n3.2.5 Social norms\n\nThis last concern about Horwich\u2019s theory stems from the fact\nthat the theory is, at its core, an individualist theory: it explains\nthe meaning of an expression for an individual in terms of properties\nof that individual\u2019s use of the term. A quite different sort of\nuse theory of meaning turns from the laws which explain an\nindividual\u2019s use of a word to the norms which, in a society,\ngovern the use of the relevant terms. Like the other views discussed\nhere, the view that meaning is a product of social norms of this sort\nhas a long history; it is particularly associated with the work of the\nlater Wittgenstein and his philosophical descendants. (See especially\nWittgenstein 1953.)\n\nAn important defender of this sort of view is Robert Brandom. On\nBrandom\u2019s view, a sentence\u2019s meaning is due to the\nconditions, in a given society, under which it is correct or\nappropriate to perform various speech acts involving the sentence. To\ndevelop a theory of this sort, one must do two things. First, one must\nshow how the meanings of expressions can be explained in terms of\nthese normative statuses\u2014in Brandom\u2019s (slightly\nnonstandard) terms, one must show how semantics can be explained in\nterms of pragmatics. Second, one must explain how these normative\nstatuses can be instituted by social practices.\n\nFor details, see Brandom (1994), in which the view is developed at\ngreat length; for a critical discussion of Brandom\u2019s attempt to\ncarry out the second task above, see Rosen (1997). For discussion of\nthe role (or lack thereof) of normativity in a foundational theory of\nmeaning, see Hattiangadi (2007), Gluer and Wilkforss (2009), and the\nentry on\n meaning normativity.",
