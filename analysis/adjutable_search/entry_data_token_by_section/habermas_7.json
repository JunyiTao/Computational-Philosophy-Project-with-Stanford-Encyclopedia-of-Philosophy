    "main_text": "Habermas\u2019s Mature Social Theory: The Theory of Communicative Action || Habermas\u2019s Social Ontology\n2.3 Habermas\u2019s Social Ontology\n\nThe third research program, Habermas\u2019s social ontology, rests on\nthe previous two.\n\nThis takes the form of dyadic analytic distinction between\n\u201csystem\u201d and \u201clifeworld\u201d, which form the\nontological counterparts or \u201ccomplements\u201d of instrument\nand strategic action, and communicative action respectively (1981\n[1987: 119]). Societies should be conceived \u201csimultaneously as\nsystems and lifeworlds\u201d (1981 [1987: 118]).\n\nThey are theoretical concepts, which enable social theorists to\nexplain social order.\n\nThey are also ontological concepts that respectively denote two\ndifferent kind of existing social order, or to put it another way two\ndistinct but complementary mechanisms of social integration. In the\nformer case, systems stabilize the\n\n\nnon-intended interconnections of action \u2026 by a non-normative\nregulation of individual decision that extend beyond the actor\u2019s\nconsciousness.\n\n\nIn the latter, the lifeworld, social integration is brought about by\nmeans of \u201ca normatively secured or communicatively achieved\nconsensus\u201d (1981 [1987: 117]).\n2.3.1 Lifeworld\n\nOn the one hand, Habermas presents the lifeworld phenomenologically as\n\u201ca background stock of cultural knowledge that is \u2018always\nalready\u2019 familiar to agents\u201d and thus makes mutual\nunderstanding possible. In this it has what he calls a \u201cpeculiar\nhalf transcendence\u201d that, unlike the formal notions of the\nsubjective, objective, and intersubjective worlds, cannot be\nobjectified and brought before consciousness (1981 [1987:\n154\u20134]). On the other hand, he associates it with specific\ndomains of social life\u2014such as family life, everyday life, and\ncivil society\u2014in which communicative actions predominate, and\nagents coordinate their interactions by means of speech-acts and their\nunderling validity claims (Baxter 2011: 166; Heath 2011: 75). Either\nway, the lifeworld enjoys a certain primacy over the system, since it\n\u201cremains the subsystem that defines the pattern of the social\nsystem as a whole\u201d and because systems \u201cneed to be\nanchored in the lifeworld\u201d (1981 [1987: 154]).\n2.3.2 System\n\nHabermas developed his notion of the system in his writings prior to\nTheory of Communicative Action, particularly through his\nengagement with Luhmann (1973a [1975: 1\u20138]). Systems are\nmacro-level processes that stabilize complexes of actions via steering\nmechanisms. The two main examples are the economy and bureaucracy,\nwhich function respectively via the steering mechanisms of money and\npower. Unlike the lifeworld, systems fulfil their functions through\n\u201ca non-normative regulation of individual decisions that extends\nbeyond the actor\u2019s consciousnesses\u201d (1981 [1987: 117]).\nThis is a reference to an \u201cinvisible hand\u201d mechanism of\nthe kind that occurs in Mandeville, Smith, and Hegel, with the\nimportant difference that in these latter theorists the invisible\nhand, providence-like, serves the common good. For Habermas the\nfunction of the systems of the economy and bureaucracy is merely to\nharmonize and stabilize complexes of individual actions, and thereby\nto bring about societal integration and reproduction. They act as\nrelief mechanisms that ease the burden on communicatively acting\nsubjects. Of course, in functioning societies the economy and\nbureaucracies should also serve the common good. According to\nHabermas\u2019s theory this only happens when the system bears the\nright kind of relation to the lifeworld.\n\nWhen Habermas first introduced the idea of the system he was engaging\nwith Luhmann\u2019s work and thinking mainly of cybernetic systems\n(1976a [1979: 170]; 1973a [1975: 130\u2013142]). A good example of a\ncybernetic system is a heater linked to a thermostat, where each\nserves as input and output. If the heat rises beyond a fixed\ntemperature, say 20 Celsius, the thermostat switches the heater off,\nand if it drops below that temperature the thermostat switches the\nheater on again (Heath 2011: 83\u201384). The result (or goal-state\nto use the slightly misleading technical term) is to keep the room at\nan even ambient temperature.\n\nHabermas construes systems, in the light of Luhmann, as spheres of\n\u201cnorm free\u201d sociality. \u201cIn capitalist societies the\nmarket is the most important example of a norm-free regulation of\ncooperative contexts\u201d (1981 [1987: 150, 154]). This puts him on\nthe side of those who see markets as destroying rather than nourishing\nthe web of moral relations. His predominant way of thinking about\nsubsystems is that they are \u201cdemoralized\u201d. This is true of\nthe market economy, bureaucracies and state administration, and the\nlaw, which in Theory of Communicative Action he treats as a\nsubsystem. That said, even in this text, while he claims that law in\nthe process of rationalization becomes \u201cdetached from the\nethical motivations of the legal person\u201d (1981 [1987: 174]), he\nnonetheless thinks of basic rights and the principle of popular\nsovereignty as sources of legitimation which act as\n\n\nbridge between a de-moralized and externalized legal sphere and a\ndeinstitutionalized and internalized morality. (1981 [1987: 178])\n\n\nSystems, which facilitate integration and social order through\n\u201cdelinguistified steering media\u201d like money and power,\nhave great advantages for citizens of modern societies. They fulfil\nfunctions that are too complex or burdensome to be undertaken by\ncommunicative action, that is, by individuals acting consciously in\nconcert. For example, markets distribute goods and resources to where\nthey are most needed, using price signals and laws of supply and\ndemand.\n\nHowever, systems also have disadvantages. For one thing, systems, once\nin place, operate independently of human agents. There is,\nconsequently, a gap between an actor\u2019s agency, and their\nconscious intentions and aims, and the purpose that they serve in the\nsystem. This lack of transparency is evident in firms, for instance,\nwhere the agents fulfil their roles and tasks, whether using\ninstrumental, communicative, or moral rationality, or a mix of all,\nwhile all the time behind their backs or \u201cbeyond their\nconsciousness\u201d at the macro-level they are making profit for the\nfirm\u2019s owners and shareholders. For another, Habermas claims,\nagents operating in spheres steered by delinguistified media are\ninclined to shift from communicative to instrumental and strategic\naction orientations with the result that\n\n\nsuccess-oriented action steered by egocentric calculations of utility\nloses its connection to action oriented by mutual understanding. (1981\n[1987: 196])\n\n\nWhether Habermas holds that agents\u2019 actions in economic and\nbureaucratic domains are merely constrained by system imperatives of\nthe relevant steering media, or reduced to instrumental and strategic\nactions is moot (J\u00fctten 2013). But it is empirically false for\nreasons given by Honneth and Joas and others that the mediatization of\na domain of social life would force agents to adopt only one type of\naction. As Joas puts it, every sphere of action contains \u201ca\nwealth of different types of action\u201d (Joas 1986 [1991: 104]).\nSystems, economic and bureaucratic, and the specific organisations\nthey comprise, all involve numerous different kinds of action. This is\nnot only an empirical claim but a conceptual one that follows from\nHabermas\u2019s own theory that instrumental and strategic action is\nparasitic on communicative action. Habermas has also been criticized\nfor being seduced by systems theory into merely accepting spheres of\nnorm free sociality, and the uncoupling of system and lifeworld as a\nnormal result of modernization and social differentiation (McCarthy\n1991).\n2.3.3 The Relation of Lifeworld to System\n\nThe relation of lifeworld to system is pivotal to Habermas\u2019s\nsocial theory. Most commentators (for example McCarthy 1991: 154 and\nBaxter 2011: 166) take this to be the main problem facing the theory.\nActually, as Habermas notes, there are two related problems: the\nproblem of constructing a theory that can combine systems theory and\naction theory fruitfully (1981 [1987: 201]), and the problem of\narticulating the actual relation between system and lifeworld.\n\nSo what is that relation? Habermas accords primacy to the lifeworld,\non the on the grounds that it \u201cdefines the pattern of the social\nsystem as a whole\u201d. Systemic mechanisms, he contends,\n\u201cneed to be anchored in the lifeworld\u201d (1981 [1987: 154]).\nIt is tempting to think that Habermas\u2019s thesis of the primacy of\nthe lifeworld over the system must have to do with the primacy of\ncommunicative over instrumental and strategic action, the view that\ninstrumental and strategic action are \u201cparasitic\u201d on\ncommunicative action, but not vice versa. However, that would be\nproblematic since Habermas does not succeed in establishing by means\nof speech-act theory that communicative action is the basic\nform of action on which instrumental and strategic action essentially\ndepend.\n\nEven if Habermas had an argument that conclusively demonstrated the\nprimacy of communicative over instrumental action, that would not\nsuffice to establish the primacy of the lifeworld over the system. The\nprimacy of one kind of action over another could not itself establish\nthe primacy of one kind of social order over another. That would be a\nconflation of levels. Habermas does in fact quite often conflate types\nof action with spheres of action, as we see from his claim cited above\nthat success-oriented individual actions are \u201csteered\u201d by\negocentric calculations (Joas 1986 [1991: 104]). For example, he talks\nof \u201csubsystems of purposive rational action\u201d and\n\u201cnormative steering\u201d (1981 [1987: 180\u20131]).\n2.4 Habermas\u2019s Critical Social Theory\n\nHabermas\u2019s thesis of the primacy of the lifeworld over the\nsystem gives him a framework in which to criticize neo-liberalism and\nits mania for the marketization and financialization of everyday life:\n\u201cthe whole program of subjecting the lifeworld to the\nimperatives of the market must be subject to scrutiny\u201d, whether\nin health care, public transport, military security, or secondary and\ntertiary education (2009: 186). He does this with his theory of the\ncolonization of the lifeworld by the system.\n2.4.1 Colonization\n\nRecall that mediatization\u2014the intrusion of steering media into\nsocial domains that were hitherto not systematically organized and\nintegrated\u2014is not, according to Habermas, itself a pathological\ndevelopment. It has a positive side, namely as a relief mechanism, a\nway of coping efficiently with complexity. But colonization, as the\nlabel suggests, is bad. Colonization occurs where\n\n\nsystemic mechanisms suppress forms of social integration even in those\nareas where a consensus-dependent coordination of action cannot be\nreplaced, that is, where the symbolic reproduction of the lifeworld is\nat stake. (1981 [1987: 196])\n\n\nSymbolic reproduction is where society is maintained through\ncommunicative actions. As a consequence of colonization, the lifeworld\nshrinks, and its capacity for symbolic reproduction atrophies (1981\n[1987: 154, 173]). This is functionally bad. To the extent that the\nsystem, and society as a whole, depend on the lifeworld and its\ncommunicative resources, colonization is self-stultifying and\ndestabilizing.\n\nHabermas follows Marx and Weber on this, rather than Luhmann, insofar\nas he shows that\n\n\nthe rationalization for the lifeworld makes possible the emergence and\ngrowth of subsystems whose independent imperatives turn back\ndestructively upon the lifeworld. (1981 [1987: 186])\n\n\nThis not only eradicates normative contexts of action but, he\nmaintains, supplants these with instrumental and strategic action\norientations, which he calls a \u201cpathological de-formation of the\ncommunicative infrastructure of the lifeworld\u201d (1981 [1987: 375,\n180, 181]). This recalls Adorno\u2019s discussion of bourgeois\ncoldness, but broadens and extends it and decouples it specifically\nfrom the moral abomination of Auschwitz (Adorno 1966 [1973: 363]). For\nexample, consider that once healthcare and housing are privatized and\nseen as mere commodities, landlords can evict tenants because of rent\narrears, and hospitals can turn away patients who cannot afford to\npay, with no moral qualms or social responsibility, because they see\nthese actions as merely economic transactions. Colonization is also\nbad, according to Habermas, insofar as it leads to a variety of social\npathologies pertaining to culture, society, and person, including loss\nof freedom, loss of meaning, crises in legitimation, anomie, and\nalienation (1981 [1987: 385; 142\u20133]).\n2.4.2 Reification\n\nHabermas presents his colonization thesis as a reformulation of the\nLuk\u00e1csian idea of reification that was so influential on the\nfirst generation of Frankfurt School critical theorists, especially\nAdorno (1981 [1984a: 399]; 1981 [1987: 1]). Luk\u00e1cs argues that\nthe commodification of all domains of modern society, and\nconsciousness thereof, has led to its \u201ctaking on the character\nof a thing\u201d, hence the economy and bureaucracy and the legal\nsystem appear to subjects as a \u201csecond nature\u201d\n(Luk\u00e1cs 1971: 83, 86). Consequently they adopt a passive\nattitude towards it, in theory as contemplation, in practice as\nadaptation. This results not only in an illusion, but also in a kind\nof inaction, since people see and treat things as natural, and so not\nup to them, and not alterable, when such things are in fact historical\nand in principle reversible, and up to them. That idea needs\nreformulating, Habermas maintains, because it mistakenly conflates\nrationalization and social differentiation with reification.\nLuk\u00e1cs, for example, thinks of rationalization as the\ndestruction of social totality, namely the substantial ethical life of\na community, as an unqualified bad, whereas Habermas sees it as having\nupsides and downsides.\n\nReification is the major downside, which Habermas sees as a specific\nalienating effect of the destruction of the communicative capacity for\nsymbolic reproduction and social integration provided by the\nlifeworld. In particular, reification arises when the intrusion of\nsteering media causes the \u201cconversion to another mechanism of\naction coordination\u201d (1981 [1987: 375]). Since this conversion\nhappens as it were behind the backs of social agents rather than\nthrough their conscious intentions and choices, colonization gives\nrise to \u201cobjectively false consciousness\u201d and its effects\n\u201chave to remain hidden\u201d (1981 [1987: 187]). Notably,\ncontra the Marxist tradition up to Luk\u00e1cs, the reification\neffect arises in class-unspecific ways and thus the crises do not\nprecipitate class conflict, which, Habermas argues, the welfare state\nhas largely succeeded in pacifying (1981 [1987: 187]). Furthermore,\nthough reification effects are \u201cfiltered through the pattern of\nsocial inequality\u201d, the latter is not one of the pathologies he\nfocuses on (1981 [1987: 349]). He focuses more on welfare state\nclientism, and juridification (1981 [1987: 357, 363\u20134]). This is\none of the important differences between Habermas\u2019s social\ntheory and Rawls\u2019s Theory of Justice, and leads to a\ncompletely different outlook in the diagnosis of social ills\n(J\u00fctten 2011).\n2.4.3 Normative Grounds\n\nThis brings us to the third significant feature of Habermas\u2019s\ncritical social theory: the problem of normative grounds. In the\nintroduction to Theory of Communicative Action Habermas\ndescribes his project as \u201cnot a meta-theory but the beginning of\na social theory concerned to validate its own critical\nstandards\u201d (Schn\u00e4delbach 1986 [1991: 8]), inviting the\ncontrast with the critical \u201csocial theory\u201d developed in\nthe mid twentieth century by Horkheimer and Adorno, which, according\nto Habermas\u2019s criticism, had foundered on \u201cthe difficulty\nof giving an account of its own normative foundations\u201d (1981\n[1984a: 374]). He also criticizes systems theory for failing to see\nthe primacy and fragility of the lifeworld, its function of embedding\nand facilitating all spheres of action, and its crucial role in\nproducing and reproducing social order. Systems theory conflates\nsystem and social integration and \u201cdeprives itself of the\nstandard of communicative rationality\u201d (1981 [1987: 186]).\n\nThis has led commentators to assume that the ideas of communicative\naction together with the theory that in modern society socialization\ntakes place through communicative action provide Habermas with an\naccount of normative foundations, of the kind he claimed was missing\nfrom earlier Frankfurt School theory. The trouble is that it is\nunclear to what extent this is a functionalist theory, supported by\nmainly empirical claims, or a normative one; and, if normative, in\nwhat sense. As Herbert Schn\u00e4delbach was among the first to point\nout, Habermas\u2019s approach of rationally reconstructing the\ncommunicative infrastructure of modern societies does not obviously\nfit the bill here. Functionalist explanation is not normative\njustification (Schn\u00e4delbach 1986 [1991: 21]). This also applies\nto his reconstructed theory of reification (J\u00fctten 2011). It is\nclear that Habermas\u2019s is a normative theory, to the extent that\nif his diagnosis is correct, the \u201cdamage\u201d done by\ncolonization is not only social and structural, individuals too are\nharmed and suffer as a result of it, and their legitimate expectations\nare disappointed. This is the case whether or not they are\n\u201cwronged\u201d. The problem can be put as a dilemma. Either\nHabermas\u2019s social theory is genuinely critical, in which case it\njudges that a colonized lifeworld is bad and ought to be changed (and\nsuch judgement requires substantive normative premises), or it stops\nshort of such a judgement, and is hence not properly critical.\n\nMaeve Cooke argues that Habermas\u2019s theory contains implicitly a\n\u201cutopian promise\u201d of a rationalized lifeworld, that is\n\u201creproduced through processes of intersubjective evaluation of\nvalidity claims\u201d (Cooke 1994: 162), so that substantial ethical\nreasons ground its normative claims. Other commentators, such as\nHonneth, assume that discourse ethics provides the account of its\nnormative foundations that, according to Habermas, earlier critical\ntheory stood in need of (Honneth 1985 [1991: 282]). However, there are\nnumerous problems with this view. One is that the normative claims of\ncritical theory stand in need of substantive moral reasons,\nrather than accounts of those reasons (Finlayson 2013a), and\nas Schn\u00e4delbach points out it is not clear that Habermas\u2019s\nrational reconstruction of communication as discourse can provide such\nreasons.\n3. Discourse Ethics\n\nDiscourse ethics was developed contemporaneously with the theory of\ncommunicative action and fits into roughly the same framework.\nDiscourse ethics comprises a number of different interlocking\ntheories:\n\nthe lineaments of a social theory of morality\na normative moral theory\na philosophical justification of the moral standpoint (the\nprinciple of universalization)\na theory of the development of moral consciousness\n\n\nUnlike the Theory of Communicative Action there is no single\nwork in which Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics is given a settled and\ncanonical statement. Instead, it is an evolving research programme,\npresented in a series of essays most of which are contained in two\nvolumes published in English as Moral Consciousness and\nCommunicative Action (1990a) and Justification and\nApplication (1993). The development of Habermas\u2019s discourse\nethics falls into two phases, roughly 1983\u20131990 and\n1991\u20131996. Broadly speaking, the essays in Moral\nConsciousness and Communicative Action comprise phase one, and\nthose from Justification and Application through to\nBetween Facts and Norms, phase two. We will call the theory\ndeveloped in phase one \u201cdiscourse ethics\u201d, and that in\nphase two, \u201cdiscourse morality\u201d. For in the beginning of\nthe 1990s Habermas introduces a distinction between morality as a\nnormative theory of rightness, and ethics as a theory of the good, in\nwhich light, he himself later notes, to be accurate he should have\nrenamed his theory \u201cthe discourse theory of morality\u201d\n(1993: 1; 1991: 7).\n3.1 Discourse\n\nDiscourse is not a synonym for language or speech. Only speech that is\nexplicitly oriented towards reaching rationally motivated consensus\ncounts as discourse (1981 [1984a: 42]). In other words, discourse is\ncommunication, for Habermas stipulates that communication just is\nspeech oriented towards reaching understanding. But discourse is\ncommunication of a special kind. When communication breaks down and\nthe everyday shared meanings and understandings that normally\ncoordinate interactions are disrupted, interlocutors have to switch\nfrom action to discourse. Discourses are a \u201creflective form of\nagreement-oriented action that \u2026sit on top of the latter\u201d\n(1986a [1990b: 245\u20136]). Discourse is a higher order of\ncommunication, with the aim of renewing or replacing a problematized\nconsensus. To participate in discourse just is to provide reasons with\nthe aim of convincing all interlocutors to accept a disputed validity\nclaim. So, on Habermas\u2019s view, discourse just is the language\ngame of argumentation in which disputed validity claims are\n\u201credeemed\u201d, and when a validity claim is redeemed\nsuccessfully the disrupted consensus is restored, renewed, or replaced\nby a new one.\n\nOn this picture, argumentation is a rule-governed practice, not a\nverbal free-for-all. Habermas identifies three levels of rules. First,\nthere are the basic rules of logic such as the principle of\ncontradiction, and the basic semantic rules of universalizability and\nconsistency (1983 [1990: 86]). Second, there are procedural norms such\nas the principles of sincerity and accountability, namely that every\nparticipant must undertake, if only implicitly, to assert only what\nshe genuinely believes and always either to justify upon request what\nshe asserts or to provide reasons for not offering a justification.\nThese are, contends Habermas, preconditions for all genuine\nargumentation, i.e., argumentation conceived as a \u201csearch for\ntruth\u201d and organized like \u201ca competition for better\narguments\u201d (1983 [1990: 87\u20138]). Third, there are the\nprocessual preconditions that immunize discourse against coercion,\nrepression, and inequality. These norms are supposed to insulate\ndiscourse from all persuasive forces except the \u201cunforced force\nof the better argument\u201d, and they must be followed, if a\nrationally motivated consensus is to be reached.\n\nHabermas suggests that the following rules of discourse can be\nestablished:\n\n(1)\nEvery subject with the competence to speak and act is allowed to\ntake part in a discourse.\n(2)\n\n\na.\nEveryone is allowed to question any assertion whatever.\nb.\nEveryone is allowed to introduce any assertion whatever into the\ndiscourse.\nc.\nEveryone is allowed to express his attitudes, desires, and\nneeds.\n \n(3)\nNo speaker may be prevented, by internal or external coercion,\nfrom exercising his rights as laid down in (1) and (2) (1983 [1990:\n89]; Rehg 1994: 62).\n\n\nThe above list is not intended to be complete. And Habermas nowhere\nprovides a complete list. They are a representative sample borrowed\nfrom Robert Alexy\u2019s Theory of Practical Discourse\n(Alexy 1978 [1990: 165\u20137]).\n3.2 Performative Self-Contradiction and Transcendental Pragmatic Justification\n\nHabermas assumes that the\n rules (1), (2) a\u2013c, and (3)\n above can be identified by a test of performative self-contradiction.\nA performative contradiction arises when a rule that speakers\npragmatically invoke by the illocutionary act of, say, assertion, is\ncontradicted by the semantic content of that assertion. An example is\nMoore\u2019s paradox: \u201cIt is raining but I don\u2019t believe\nit\u201d (Moore 1993). Habermas maintains that the test of whether\nthe denial of a rule yields a performative contradiction does not\njustify rules of discourse so much as identify them (1983 [1990: 95]).\nOn that point, he differs from his colleague Karl-Otto Apel, who in\nhis seminal 1973 paper attempts what he calls a\ntranscendental-pragmatic, \u201cultimate\u201d justification of the\nnorms of a minimal ethics, by showing how they follow directly from\nthe pragmatic preconditions of communication (Apel 1976 [1980]).\nAccording to Cristoph Lumer, Habermas made the same attempt in the\noriginal manuscript of Moral Consciousness and Communicative\nAction, though abandoned it in subsequent versions (Lumer 1997:\n50). Later, as Heath (2014: 843) notes, Habermas denies that his\nprinciple of universalizability (U)\u2014see\n \u00a73.3\n below\u2014can be justified through a \u201cperformative\ncontradiction argument\u201d, not only because applying the test of\nperformative contradiction to a rule is in his view heuristic, not\njustificatory, but also, because he thinks, no such principles and\ncertainly no substantive moral norms follow directly from those\nrules.\n3.3 The Principles of Discourse Ethics and their Justification\n\nThe two principles of discourse ethics are principle (D) and principle\n(U), the principle of universalizability. In phase one, Habermas\nformulates (D) as follows:\n\n(D)\nOnly those norms can claim to be valid that meet (or could meet)\nwith the approval of all in their capacity as participants in a\npractical discourse (1983 [1990: 66]).\n\n\nHe initially calls (D) \u201cthe principle of discourse ethics\u201d\n(1983 [1990: 66]). It takes the form of a straightforward validity to\nconsensus (or possible consensus) conditional. The scope of the\nconsensus is \u201call those affected\u201d by the norms. As such it\nis universal among participants in practical discourse, namely among\nall agents.\n\nIn addition, there is principle (U)\u2014the principle of\nuniversalization, which spells out the \u201ccriterion for\ngeneralizing maxims of action\u201d (1983 [1990: 62]). Every valid\nnorm has to fulfil the following condition:\n\n(U)\nAll affected can accept the consequences and the side effects its\ngeneral observance can be anticipated to have for the satisfaction of\neveryone\u2019s interests (and these consequences are\npreferred to those of known alternative possibilities (1983 [1990:\n65]).\n\n\nHabermas first introduces (U) as \u201ca rule of argument that makes\nagreement in practical discourses possible\u201d (1983 [1990: 66]).\nIn phase one he begins with a justification of (U), and then infers\n(D) (1983 [1990: 93]). The initial idea was that (U) was to be given a\n\u201ctranscendental pragmatic\u201d derivation from the rules of\ndiscourse, and (D) inferred from (U). The nature of the putative\ntransition between (U) and (D) however remains unclear (Lumer 1997:\n49), and Habermas has not succeeded in clarifying it.\n\nIn the 1983 programme, after having distanced himself from\nApel\u2019s programme, Habermas proposes to justify (U) by deriving\nit logically from two premises: (1) the rules of discourse and (2)\n\u201cthe idea of the justification of norms\u201d or \u201ca weak\nidea of normative justification\u201d (1983 [1990: 92, 97]). Later,\nin phase two, Habermas reverses the order of justification, and infers\n(U), now designated the \u201cmoral principle\u201d, from (D). At\nthe same time, he weakens (D) by making it apply generally to all\nnorms of action whether moral or not, and labels it \u201cthe\ndiscourse principle\u201d:\n\n(D)\nOnly those action norms are valid to which all possibly affected\npersons could agree as participants in rational discourse\n(1992b [1996b: 107]).\n\n\n(D) now merely \u201cexpresses the meaning of post-conventional\nrequirements of justification\u201d (1992b [1996b: 107]), and is\ngiven along with premise (2). It supposedly merely explicates\n\u201cthe point of view from which action norms can be impartially\ngrounded\u201d (1992b [1996b: 109]). While Habermas weakens (D) he\nstrengthens (U).\n\n\na norm is valid if and only if the foreseeable consequences\nand side effects of its general observance for the interests and\nvalue-orientations of each individual could be freely\naccepted jointly by all concerned. (1996a essay 1:\n60 [1998a: 42 translation amended])\n\n\nNeither Habermas\u2019s followers, with the possible exception of\nRehg (1991 & 1994), nor any of his critics, think that this\nlogical derivation of (U) goes through. Gradually, Habermas backs away\nfrom the claim that (U) can be given a logical or formal derivation.\nHe presents discourse ethics as a \u201cprogramme\u201d of\nphilosophical justification and keeps adding stronger premises to that\nprogramme (Lumer 1997: 53; Habermas 1983 [1990: 43]). According to\nKettner the fact that in phase two (D) is no longer the principle of\ndiscourse ethics, but construed as \u201cstill neutral\u201d with\nregard to morality and law, together with the fact that (U) is now the\nmoral principle, means that the grounding of discourse ethics\nis normatively incomplete, and this effectively amounts to the\n\u201cdisappearance\u201d of the original project, which was\nsupposed to show that the moral principle and the moral point of view\nfall out of the success conditions for communicative action (Kettner\n2002: 207, 211\u201312).\n\nTo sidestep the absence (or failure) of a logical derivation of (U),\nHabermas presents (U) provisionally as an abductive hypothesis (1996a\nessay 1: 60 [1998a: 42]) where abduction is an inference to the best\nexplanation. Ott makes an attempt to justify (D) and (U) as a\nconjunction of pragmatic implications (Ott 1996: 42\u201345), while\nFinlayson claims that U is best thought of as an inference to the best\nexplanation, and both agree that it rests on supplementary premises\ndrawn from Habermas\u2019s modernization theory (Finlayson 2000; Ott\n1996). This raises the question of what kind of justification of the\nmoral standpoint Habermas has in mind. In Moral Consciousness and\nCommunicative Action he presents discourse ethics as a defence of\na cognitivist account of morality against the moral sceptic on grounds\nthat even the sceptic must accept (1983 [1990: 76ff]). The\nphilosophical programme of justification looks like a\nconstructivist\u2014and what Gunnarsson calls a\n\u201crationalist\u201d\u2014argument, invoking slender premises\nand reaching thick normative conclusions, albeit the said normative\nconclusions are not substantial moral norms, but a moral principle of\nuniversalization, and an account of the moral point of view, in which\nmoral agents (participants in discourse) collectively validate\nsubstantial moral norms (Gunnarsson 2000: 99, see also Rees 2020:\n678\u201381, 689\u201391). Gunnarsson argues that all\nHabermas\u2019s rationalist arguments for (U) fail. Benhabib is also\nof this view. In an early critique she argued that (U) was redundant,\nand that (D) should be given a \u201cweak justification\nprogramme\u201d which adduced supplementary moral premises of\n\u201cuniversal respect\u201d and \u201cegalitarian\nreciprocity\u201d (Benhabib 1986: 308; 1992: 31). Habermas\u2019s\ntendency to add ever stronger supplementary premises for his\njustification of (U) is a tacit acknowledgement of his failure to\nprovide either a formal derivation or a \u201crationalist\u201d\njustification of (U). In doing so he moves away from his original idea\nof providing a philosophical justification of (U), towards a more\nmodest explication and reconstruction of the moral point of view,\nwhich can be corroborated by insights drawn from an array of\ndisciplines, including the moral psychology of Lawrence Kohlberg.\n3.4 (U) and Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative\n\nPrinciples (D) and (U) are supposed to capture the practice of\nuniversalization in ethics, but in a social sense that differs from\napparently similar procedures in Rawls, whom Habermas takes to be\nworking in the Kantian tradition of political philosophy. The\ndifferences are as follows. (U) is not presented as a moral norm: it\nis not formulated as an imperative. Initially, (U) is presented as\n\u201ca bridging principle\u201d on analogy with the principle of\ninduction, except that (U) tests whether norms are amenable to\nconsensus among all affected, given their interests. (U) is not a\nhypothetical test for generating moral norms. It rationally\nreconstructs an actual practice by which real moral\nagents, as participants in an actual discourse, themselves ascertain\nthe validity of moral norms, or institute them. Finally, whereas,\naccording to Habermas, the test of universalization contained in\nKant\u2019s first formulation of the Categorical Imperative is\n\u201cmonological\u201d, since it can be performed by each person\nindividually, the procedure captured by (U) is\n\u201cdialogical\u201d since it must involve other people acting\ntogether. As McCarthy puts it:\n\n\nRather than ascribing as valid to all others any maxim that I can will\nto be a universal law, I must submit my maxim to all others for the\npurposes of discursively testing its claim to universality. The\nemphasis shifts from what each can will without contradiction to be a\ngeneral law, to what all can will in agreement to be a universal norm.\n(1983 [1990: 67], Habermas quoting McCarthy 1978: 326)\n\n\nFinally, on the Kantian conception a maxim is adopted in virtue of its\nuniversal form, whereas on Habermas\u2019s conception it is not just\nthe form of the maxim that is universalized. It is in part the\ncontent of the norm that is universalized. This is\nwhy (U) refers to the \u201cinterests\u201d of everyone affected it.\nBut on Habermas\u2019s view universalization is thought of as a\nsocial process that extends to the very self-conception of the moral\nagent. Habermas\u2019s guiding idea here is G. H. Mead\u2019s notion\nof \u201cideal role taking\u201d (1988b: chapter 3 [1992a]; 1983\n[1990: 56\u201368, 121]), in which moral agents learn by projecting\nthemselves into the position of all other moral agents. This is a\nprocess whereby agents consider \u201cevery interest involved\u201d\nand evaluate what is \u201cgood for everyone under the same\nconditions\u201d, a process that, according to Mead, leads \u201cto\nthe development of a larger self, which can be identified with the\ninterests of others\u201d (Mead 1934 [1962: 363]).\n3.5 The Return of Habermas\u2019s Kantianism and the Morality/Ethics Distinction\n\nHabermas thus develops a distinctively social and intersubjective\nversion of ethics, different from Kant\u2019s. But certain\ndevelopments in phase two push back toward a Kantian conception of\ndiscourse ethics (Heath 2014: 846). In Between Facts and\nNorms, (U) is said to allow participants to agree on norms that\nare impartial, and that have \u201ccategorial validity\u201d (1992b\n[1996b: 28]). And Habermas appears to hold, like Kant, that the\nrational will is the source of moral obligation (1992b [1996b: 110];\nKettner 2002, 212). Furthermore, the moral domain, which in phase one\nencompassed the entire domain of action norms and values, later\n\u201cshrinks\u201d to a domain of thinner, universal moral norms\nwith characteristic overridingness and stringency (1991a chapter 6,\n202 [1993: 91]).\n\nIt is primarily Habermas\u2019s introduction of a tripartite typology\nof practical reason\u2014the ethical, moral, and pragmatic\nemployments of practical reason\u2014that drives his return to Kant\nin Between Facts and Norms. In particular Habermas introduces\na notion of ethical discourse that differs from moral discourse in\nthat it addresses clinical questions such as \u201cWhat is the good\nlife (for me, or for us)?\u201d and that is restricted in scope to\ncommunities with shared values. Ethical discourses differ, he claims,\nfrom moral discourses which deal with questions of justice, understood\nas what is equally in the interests of all (1983 [1990: 180]; 1991a\nchapter 5, 101\u2013105 [1993: chapter 1, 3\u20138]; 1996a essay 1:\n39\u201340 [1998a: 26\u20137]). He understands \u201cjustice\u201d\nnot as a political value, as the later Rawls does, but as the supreme\nmoral value, and the designated value of moral discourse, on analogy\nwith truth for theoretical discourse. Although he allows that many\nquestions can be addressed by both ethical and moral discourses, he\ndraws a sharp distinction between them and accords priority to\nmorality over ethics (1983 [1990: 104]; 1991a chapter 5, 100\u2013119\n[1993: chapter 1, 1\u201317]). Ethical discourses always take place\nwithin the bounds of moral permissibility, and on Habermas\u2019s\naccount no moral norm can be weighed against, or trumped by, any\nethical value. Along with various communitarians, Charles Taylor and\nMartin Seel both criticize Habermas on this point and defend the idea\nthat the good (albeit construed in different ways) has priority over\nthe morally right (Taylor 1989 [1992]; Seel 1995).\n\nThe ethics/morality distinction has also been a target of much\ncriticism. Benhabib (1986), McCarthy (1991; chapter 7: 181\u2013200);\nPutnam (2002); and Kettner (2002), among others have shown that\nHabermas cannot and does not maintain a sharp distinction between the\ntwo. The main reason they give is that the notion of value that\nHabermas associates with ethics bleeds into his conception of a valid\nmoral norm. Indeed, Habermas himself acknowledges the existence of\nwhat he calls a \u201chidden link\u201d between justice and the\ncommon good (1983 [1990: 202]), and \u201cthe remnant of the good at\nthe core of the right\u201d (\u201cdas Gute im Gerechten\u201d)\n(1996a essay 1: 43 [1998a: 29]). And he appears to think of this\nrelation, not as threat to his conception of morality but as a feature\nof it, namely that it rests on an underlying web of solidary relations\nbetween human beings. Habermas claims that morality arose from this\nweb of solidarity as a process of generalization and universalization\nin the course of modernization, and, he claims, although solidarity\nremains as the other side of justice (qua moral rightness)\nthis does not smudge the bright line between ethics and morality\n(Habermas 1986a [1990b]).\n\nKettner objects that Habermas\u2019s typology is dogmatic,\nestablished by \u201cterminological fiat\u201d and that it should\nnot be seen as an insight into the nature of practical reason (Kettner\n2002: 208). Few critics are prepared to defend Habermas\u2019s\ndistinction with the notable exception of Rainer Forst (Forst 2007\n[2011: 60\u201379]). In the final analysis, Habermas settles on the\nview of discourse ethics in general, and (U) in particular, as a\nreconstruction of an alternative to Kant\u2019s first formula of the\nCategorical Imperative that is allegedly superior to the latter in\nvirtue of being dialogical rather than monological and the\nreconstruction of an actual practice involving real moral agents.\n3.6 Dialogical vs. Monological Morality\n\nMuch depends on Habermas\u2019s articulation and defence of the\ndistinction between a dialogical and a monological ethics, and his\nargument for the superiority of the former, which he makes with\nvehemence and conviction both in his critical engagement with Lawrence\nKohlberg and later in his debate with Rawls. Nonetheless, critics have\nargued that the putative distinction between dialogical and\nmonological ethics is one without a difference, and have cast doubt on\nHabermas\u2019s argument for the cognitive superiority of dialogical\nethics. McMahon argues that (U) is ambiguous between two very\ndifferent conceptions of dialogicality. Weak dialogicality consists in\nthe concurrence of independent judgements about which norm would\nsatisfy the interest of all concerned, that is put together in\npiecemeal fashion (McMahon 2000: 521). Strong dialogicality, by\ncontrast, involves a collective, joint judgement by all affected.\nMcMahon claims that Habermas, and Rehg (1991 & 1994), whose\ninterpretation of (U) Habermas cites approvingly (1992b [1996b: 109]),\nendorse the strong conception. But the strong conception, which\nrequires that each participant in discourse suspend judgement until\nall other have cast their vote, is, so to speak, incoherent. For one\nthing, it robs each participant of any reason to judge from their own\nperspective whether a norm is valid. For another, it renders deviation\nfrom a norm impossible, because as soon as an agent deviates from a\nnorm, it is no longer valid, and cannot be criticized as mistaken\n(McMahon 2000: 529).\n\nAnother reason to think that the distinction is without a difference\nis that Habermas allows participants in an actual discourse to conduct\nadvocatory discourses whereby they imaginatively project themselves\ninto other people\u2019s points of view. He must allow this because\nit would be impossible to conduct an actual discourse with \u201call\naffected\u201d by a norm. So Habermas must allow that the\nconstituency of all participants in an actual discourse might be\nsmall, at the limit two people, and that the constituency of\n\u201call affected\u201d by a norm might consist of every moral\nagent and patient including the unborn. But with that degree of\nidealization, the difference between an ideal discourse conducted\nmonologically and an actual but advocatory dialogue between real\npeople has all but disappeared, and the cognitive superiority of the\nlatter cannot be maintained.\n3.7 Discourse Ethics and Critical Social Theory\n\nHabermas claimed in Theory of Communicative Action that\nAdorno and Horkheimer\u2019s critical theory failed to provide an\nadequate account \u201cof its own normative foundations\u201d (1981\n[1984a: 374]) and that his own project was, by contrast the\n\u201cbeginning of a social theory concerned to validate its own\ncritical standards\u201d (1981 [1984a: xxxix]).\n\nIn Legitimation Crisis Habermas had explored the idea that\ncritical social theory could find its point d\u2019appui in\n\u201csuppressed generalizable interests\u201d, namely the\nunrealized rational potentials of modern society (1973a [1975: 111]).\nAs we saw, and Habermas himself admits, he did not develop this\napproach in Theory of Communicative Action. He claimed that\ncritical theory must refrain from \u201ccritically evaluating\n\u2026 forms of life and cultures \u2026 as a whole\u201d and\nfocused instead on investigating the way in which communicative\npathologies arising from the colonization of the lifeworld hinder\n\u201clearning potentials\u201d (1981 [1984a: 383]). Critics such as\nSchn\u00e4delbach and Taylor countered that such an approach would\nonly explicate critical or rational potentials, but never\njustify normative criticisms of society (Schn\u00e4delbach\n1986 [1991]; Taylor 1986 [1991]). Recall that (U) is a moral principle\nthat is supposed to validate norms containing generalizable interests.\nSome of Habermas\u2019s supporters in the 1980s, for example, Honneth\nand Benhabib, argued that discourse ethics could serve as the account\nof the normative foundations that Habermas argued first generation\ncritical theory was missing (Honneth 1985 [1991: 286]; Benhabib 1986:\n279\u201381).\n\nThe trouble is that Habermas\u2019s social theory does not set out to\ncriticize society in virtue of its degree of conformity to principle\n(U) or to any substantive moral principle. Habermas continues to deny\nthat this is the proper approach of social theory. He explicitly\nrebukes Rawls for thinking that the theorist can criticize society by\nfirst designing \u201cthe basic norms of a well-ordered society on\nthe drafting table\u201d and then checking society against it (1990d\n[1994: 101]; 1996a essay 3: 122 [1998a: 97]). That approach arrogates\nthe task of criticism to the philosopher, instead of social agents and\ncitizens. Besides which, the problem, as Schn\u00e4delbach understands\nit, is that social criticism proper requires normative judgements,\nwhich must be supported by normative reasons, while discourse ethics\nlimits itself to the clarification of the moral point of view, and (U)\nis a procedural principle that leaves such judgements up to\nparticipants in discourse, and cannot furnish the requisite reasons\n(Finlayson 2013b).\n3.8 Other Criticisms\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s a number of feminist critics, inspired by Carol\nGilligan\u2019s critique of Kohlberg, In a Different Voice,\ndeveloped two significant lines of argument against Kantian moral\ntheory and Rawlsian liberalism. The first was that the\n\u201cliberal\u201d conception of the moral self is formal,\nabstract, and gender-neutral. The second was that the moral self is a\nmale self masquerading as neutral and universal. The suggestion is\nthat morality/moral theory is complicit with discrimination against\nwomen and patriarchal oppression. They aimed a similar criticism at\nKantian, Rawlsian, and Kohlbergian conceptions of \u201cthe moral\nstandpoint\u201d (Benhabib & Cornell [eds] 1987a; Benhabib 1992;\nMeehan [ed.] 1995). Among these feminist critics, some, e.g., Benhabib\nand Meehan, were initially supportive of discourse ethics because of\nits emphasis on including other voices, and its insistence its ideals\nmust be won from the reconstruction of actual practices of real\nagents. Later, their arguments were recalibrated and turned against\ndiscourse ethics. Because the moral self is conceived as formal and\nabstract, and because the moral point of view is characterized by the\nformal criteria of universalizability and reversibility,\nHabermas\u2019s discourse ethics cannot accommodate the kind of moral\nexperiences that, Gilligan maintains, are characteristic of women: it\nis blind to the importance of considerations of care and\nresponsibility for others. This leads Benhabib claims to a\nprivatisation, personalisation, and devaluation of women\u2019s moral\nexperiences (Benhabib & Cornell 1987a: 7\u20139; Benhabib 1992:\n152, 184). She argues further that \u201cthe restriction of the moral\ndomain to questions of justice\u201d results in \u201cthe\nprivatization of women\u2019s experience and leads to epistemological\nblindness towards the concrete other\u201d (Benhabib 1992: 164).\nThere is some doubt whether Benhabib\u2019s position amounts to a\nrefutation of Habermas\u2019s theory or an explication of it. The\nuniversalization procedure imposed by discourse involves participants\nin moral discourse imaginatively switching perspectives with concrete\nother people. If it were not so, if \u201cideal role taking\u201d\ndemanded only that one examined candidate norms from the perspective\nof others generally conceived, there would be nothing to gain from\nsuch a procedure (Finlayson 2013a). It is also unclear, whether such\ncriticisms apply to Habermas\u2019s moral theory, or to the actually\nexisting Kohlbergian \u201cStage 6\u201d morality he takes as its\nobject. Second, it is unclear whether the criticism shows merely that\ndiscourse ethics is a flawed moral theory, or whether it shows that,\nby dint of these flaws, the theory (or the morality it theorizes)\nperpetuates discrimination or oppression against women.\n\nFinally, discourse ethics together with the theory of modernity in\nTheory of Communicative Action has been criticized from an\nanti-colonial perspective. The most sustained and detailed criticism\ncomes from Amy Allen. Noting that Habermas\u2019s argument for\nprinciples (D) and (U) rests on assumptions drawn from modernization\ntheory, she brings the charge of Eurocentrism. Furthermore, building\non criticisms by Dussel (1993) and Bhambra (2011) among others, she\nargues that Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics is wedded to a theory of\nsocial evolution and the idea of modernization as a learning process,\nwhich commits him to a \u201cprogressive view of history\u201d\n(Allen 2016: 72\u20133). In spite of his attempt to deflate the\npresuppositions of the philosophy of history that weighed on Western\nMarxism, Allen and Dussel argue that Habermas\u2019s theory is\nfreighted with a dogmatic Hegelian universalism that in the final\nanalysis asserts the developmental superiority of European\nmodernity.\n4. The Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy: Between Facts and Norms\n\nBetween Facts and Norms is a legal and political theory\nfocused on the ways in which constitutional democracies produce and\ninstitutionalize democratically legitimate law. As Habermas wrote and\nresearched the book in the late 80s and early 90s, political theory\nwas in the grip of the debate between liberalism of a Rawlsian or\nKantian stripe, and communitarianism, or as Habermas preferred to call\nit Neo-Aristotelianism. In Between Facts and Norms he\nattempts to mediate between these two opposed approaches to political\ntheory. He does this by setting out and defending the thesis of the\nequiprimordiality (or co-originality) of liberal rights and popular\nsovereignty, and their correlative values of individual and collective\nautonomy.\n\nOne of the basic ideas in Between Facts and Norms is that the\nrule of law, and indeed\u2014though this is implied not\nstated\u2014legitimate liberal constitutional states, cannot exist\nwithout radical democracy (1992b [1996b: xlii]). But at the same time\nradical democracy has to be made compatible with the exigencies of\nlarge scale administrative and bureaucratic states organized through\nlaw. At the same time Habermas also tries to locate and defend the\ncommon ground between legal positivists, like Austin, and normativists\nlike Dworkin and Rawls. He does this by identifying and rationally\nreconstructing the \u201cnormative self-understanding\u201d of the\nlegal system as embodied in\n\n\nparticles and fragments of an \u201cexisting reason\u201d already\nincorporated in existing practices. (1992b [1996b: 287])\n\n\nHabermas does not oppose the ideal, but attempts to reconstruct\nidealizations embodied in existing practices, and set these in play\nwithout relying on the optimistic providential assumptions of the\nphilosophy of history. The practices he has in mind are legislative\npractices, and the \u201cparticles of existing reason\u201d consist\nin the various ways in which discourse is built into those practices.\nIn short Habermas reconstructs and describes the ways in which\ndiscourse is institutionalized by political and legal systems. Thus\nhis approach is a hybrid between the sociology of law and\njurisprudence, and normative political philosophy. The approach is\ncaptured by the title Faktizit\u00e4t und Geltung (literally\n\u201cFacticity and Validity\u201d), or Between Facts and\nNorms where the \u201cbetween\u201d designates a complex set of\ninterrelations, rather than a middle ground.\n4.1 The Two-Tracked Theory of Democracy\n\nHabermas\u2019s conception of democracy has been called a \u201ctwo\ntrack\u201d theory (Baynes 1995). That said, it is more like a\n\u201ctwo complex\u201d conception, since the \u201ctracks\u201d\nin question designate the formal and informal public spheres and each\nof these is a complex. At the centre is the parliamentary complex, not\nonly parliament but the administrative and judicial bodies\naccompanying it. Parliament itself is a formal \u201cpublic\u201d\nforum that is legally established and organized to take decisions\n(1992b [1996b: 355]).\n\nIt is surrounded by and embedded in an \u201cinformal\u201d public\nsphere, an \u201copen and inclusive network\u201d of various kinds\nof discourse\u2014moral, ethical, and pragmatic\u2014that form\n\u201ca \u2018wild\u2019 complex\u201d that is not formally\norganized, even though each form of discourse has its own internal\ndiscipline. (1992b [1996b: 307]). (Habermas also calls the informal\npublic sphere \u201ccivil society\u201d to indicate that it is not\nlegally or political regulated.) When deliberative democracy works as\nit should, discourse and its outputs\u2014moral norms, values, and\nmore broadly public opinion\u2014percolate into the parliamentary\ncomplex through a system of sluices and channels (1992b [1996b: 355]).\nThese inputs are then worked up in parliamentary discussion and debate\nand eventually embodied in the form of laws and policies and returned\nas outputs into society at large. As they have been shaped by public\nopinion and shared moral values, and worked up through debate, they\nfind acceptance by citizens on the basis of the reasons they embody.\nThat is how, when things go well, according to Habermas\u2019s\ntheory, legitimate law is produced. Roughly, this is Habermas\u2019s\naccount of the production of the \u201cvalidity\u201d of modern\nlaw.\n\nThis model can also be thought of in terms of the circulation of\ncommunicative power from periphery to centre, whereby the unregulated\nflows of communication and discourse in civil society lay siege to the\npolitical system, \u201cwithout, however, intending to conquer\nit\u201d (1992b [1996b: 487]) but in a manner than allows them to\ninfluence judgement and decisions in the political system. The model\nis supposed to explain how the embers of radical democracy can stay\naflame within a modern bureaucratic state. Earlier models of popular\nsovereignty presuppose that society is \u201can association writ\nlarge\u201d or a macro-subject with a sovereign will: citizens are\nactually authors of the very laws to which they must submit, and hence\nencounter these as an expression of, not a constraint on, their\nautonomy. But such a model would only work, if at all, in small-scale,\nethically homogeneous societies, with a very high degree of popular\nparticipation, none of which applies to modern Western states (1992b\n[1996b: 102\u20133]). By contrast, Habermas\u2019s discourse theory\noffers a picture where members of civil society can, through\nparticipation in discourse, help shape public opinion, which through\nthe circulation of communicative power from periphery to centre can\nindirectly \u201cprogram\u201d or \u201ccounter-steer\u201d the\npolitical system (1992b [1996b: 372; 332]) by means of laws and\npolicies that are \u201cin the equal interest of all\u201d (1992b\n[1996b: 98; 154]). In this way, he claims, the political autonomy of\nlegal persons is ensured since they\n\n\ncan at the same time understand themselves as authors of the law to\nwhich they are subject as addressees. (1992b [1996b: 408 187])\n\n\nWilliam E. Scheuerman\u2019s objection is pertinent here. On\nHabermas\u2019s view, a law acts as a \u201ctransformer\u201d\nbetween the communicative power circulating in civil society and the\nadministrative power of the legal and political systems, and it has to\ndo so if it is to facilitate social integration. However, this view is\nincompatible with Habermas\u2019s earlier conception of system and\nlifeworld, according to which the former, which includes the legal and\nadministrative system, remains a \u201cblock of more or less norm\nfree sociality\u201d (1981 [1987: 171]). And Scheuerman points out\nthat, not only is it improbable that communicative power can be\ntransformed into administrative power and counter-steer the political\nsystem, but Habermas gives no detail about where this interface\nlies\u2014institutionally speaking\u2014and how it operates.\n\nA more radical objection stems from direction of the Rochester School\nwho consider that the very idea of a \u201ccommon good\u201d or\n\u201cthe equal interests of all\u201d that might be served by law,\nis an illusion (Riker 1982). Other realist theorists of democracy,\ne.g., Luhmann, deny that public reasons flowing into the political\nsystem from civil society can and do steer political decisions\n(Luhmann 1969).\n4.2 The Co-Originality Thesis\n\nHabermas\u2019s theory asserts what he calls a co-originality thesis,\nbetween various pairs of political ideas: between the system of rights\nand the principle of democracy; between private/individual and\npublic/political/civic autonomy; between individual rights that secure\nthe former, and popular sovereignty that is the expression of the\nlatter. Co-originality means that both enjoy equal priority, and that\nneither is reducible to each other: they reciprocally call one another\ninto being. The co-originality relations are revealed when the idea of\nself-legislation, namely \u201cthat the addressees of law are\nsimultaneously authors of their rights\u201d is decoded in\ndiscourse-theoretical terms (1992b [1996b: 104, 314, 409]).\n\nThe co-originality thesis has both architectonic significance for\nHabermas\u2019s theory and substantive implications. The\narchitectonic implication is that both the principle of democracy, and\nthe system of rights are derived independently of principle (U). One\nsubstantive implication is, as Ingeborg Maus argues (Maus 1996 [2002:\n90\u201398]), that\n\n\nthe circular process in which the \u2026 legal form, and \u2026\nthe democratic principle\u2014are co-originally constituted\n(1992b [1996b: 122])\n\n\nindicates that basic rights are called into being by the democratic\nprocess and vice versa, in such a way that neither depends on, or is\nexternally constrained by, an antecedently existing order of moral\nrights (pace Larmore 1995) or an ethical form of life\n(pace Bernstein 1996 [1998] & Michelman 1998). The\nco-originality thesis thus expresses Habermas\u2019s view of the\nautonomy of the political (and legal) domain from the moral, and the\nsui generis nature of political legitimacy.\n4.3 The Principle of Democracy\n\nThe keystone of Habermas\u2019s political theory is the principle of\ndemocracy that states:\n\n\nOnly those statutes may claim legitimacy that can meet with the assent\nof all citizens in a discursive process of legislation that in turn\nhas been legally constituted. (1992b [1996b: 110])\n\n\nIt also takes the form of a validity to consensus conditional, though\ndemocratic discourse is inclusive of ethical, moral, and pragmatic\nreasons, and indeed fair compromises, so that consensus is a messy and\nimperfect affair. This makes the process of reaching discursive\nagreement far more difficult, when one considers that many deeply held\nethical values are limited to particular cultural communities, though\nthis difficulty is supposed to be mitigated by the mediation of the\nlegislative process.\n\nA central contention of Between Facts and Norms is that what\nHabermas calls the principle of democracy \u201cderives\u201d from\nthe interpenetration of principle (D) and the legal form (1992b\n[1996b: 122\u20133]). Recall that in phase two principle (D) is\nsupposed to be a rule of practical argumentation in general that is\nneutral with respect to morality and law (1992b [1996b: 107]). In this\nrespect, Habermas claims, as in respect of the circular process of\nreciprocal co-original constitution, the principle of democracy is\n\u201cmorally freestanding\u201d (1992b [1996b: 80]). That is, the\nprinciple of democracy is derived completely independently of the\nmoral principle (Finlayson 2019: 94). Here again Habermas insists on\nthe autonomy of the democratic political process, and claims that the\ndemocratic procedure of the production of law is the sole source of\nits legitimacy, and he criticizes the views of Rawls, Dworkin,\nLarmore, and Apel, all of whom, in various different ways, claim that\nthe legitimacy (or validity) of law is borrowed from that of\nmorality.\n\nOne difficulty facing Habermas is to square his claims that (a)\ndemocratic discourse is an amalgam of all three kinds of discourse,\nand (b) that political legitimacy is sui generis and both\nethically and \u201cmorally freestanding\u201d, with (c) the\nabsolute priority of morality in all spheres. He claims that\nlegitimate laws \u201cmust harmonize with the universal principles of\njustice\u201d (1992b [1996b: 99, 155]) and that legitimate laws must\nnot \u201ccontradict basic moral principles\u201d (1992b [1996b:\n106]), by which he means valid moral norms. He places a moral\npermissibility constraint on political legitimacy, in such a way that\nit appears that morality constrains political legitimacy from the\noutside (Finlayson 2016). Habermas does not, though, see this as an\n\u201cexternal\u201d constraint, since he argues that morality flows\ninto the political and legal domain through the constitutional role of\nbasic rights, and circulates within it. Nevertheless, the moral\npermissibility constraint smudges the bright line that Habermas likes\nto draw between what he calls natural law theories of legitimacy,\nwhich are based on an antecedent morality, and discourse theory, which\nis not.\n4.4 The System of Rights\n\nHabermas argues that, alongside the principle of democracy, what he\ncalls a \u201clogical genesis of rights\u201d arises from the\n\u201cinterpenetration\u201d of the legal form and the discourse\nprinciple (D) (1992b [1996b: 121]). The argument is hard to follow. It\nbegins from the premises of (D) and the form of modern law, and\nassumes that the idea of legitimate law presupposes that of a legal\nsubject qua bearer of rights, no matter what the content of those\nspecific rights is. The conclusion to the argument is a system of\nrights, of five different kinds.\n\nBasic rights to the greatest possible measure of equal individual\nliberties.\nBasic rights to membership in a voluntary association of\nconsociates under law.\nBasic rights to the actionability of rights arising from the legal\nprotection of rights-holders.\nBasic rights to the equal opportunity to participate in the\nprocesses of political will formation and the production of legitimate\nlaw.\nBasic rights to living conditions that are socially,\ntechnologically, and ecologically safeguarded, insofar as this is\nnecessary for citizens to exercise their civil rights 1\u20134\n(1996b: 123\u20134).\n\n\nThe first three rights are supposed to arise theoretically from the\napplication of the discourse principle to the form of law. These are\nrights that citizens must grant to one another if they are\n\u201clegitimately to regulate their living together by means of\npositive law\u201d (1992b [1996b: 126; 82; 118]). The next\ntwo\u2014political and social rights\u2014are practical and material\nenabling conditions that ensure the effectiveness of the first three\nrights. The first three rights, Habermas claims, are not specific\nrights, but what he calls \u201cunsaturated placeholders\u201d for\nspecific rights that have to \u201cbe interpreted and given concrete\nshape\u201d by actual citizens in response to determinate historical\nconditions (1992b [1996b: 125\u20136]). This is crucial to\nHabermas\u2019s theory, because it purports to reconstruct the\nability of citizens, from their perspective, to reciprocally grant one\nanother the rights necessary for their common existence as consociates\nunder law. That\u2019s why he claims that he, unlike Rawls,\ndoesn\u2019t design \u201cthe basic norms of a well-ordered society\non the drafting table\u201d, and then apply them to society (1990d\n[1994: 101]). In that sense, just as discourse ethics leaves the\nvalidation of moral norms to participants in discourse, the discourse\ntheory of law and democracy has to leave the political process of\nestablishing a system of rights up to citizens themselves as much as\npossible. This is the sense in which Habermas claims the discourse\ntheory of democratic legitimacy is \u201cstrictly procedural\u201d\nand more modest than \u201cnormative political theory\u201d \u00e0\nla Rawls (Habermas 1995: 117 & 132; Rawls 1995: 175\u2013177).\nFor all that, unlike in discourse ethics where neither (U) nor (D)\nhave the status of valid moral norms, Habermas nonetheless derives a\nsystem of rights that for all the world resembles T. H.\nMarshall\u2019s Whiggish account of civic, political, and social\nrights, in his classic work of political sociology (Marshall\n1950).\n4.5 Objections to Between Facts and Norms\n\nJoshua Cohen objects that the principle of discourse does not amount\nto a requirement of equal liberty, and that nothing so rich as\nHabermas\u2019s scheme of individual liberties follows solely from\nthe application of the discourse principle to the legal form (Cohen\n1999: 393, 398). He objects even while acknowledging that the various\nrights are not yet saturated: they are not yet specific, historically\nand socially determinate rights. But contra Cohen, on Habermas\u2019s\naccount, legal form, or modern \u201cform of law\u201d is a richer\nidea than the mere rule of law, and refers to a complex of features\nthat law has in a modern constitutional democratic state. As Baynes\nand Zurn point out, Habermas\u2019s theory reconstructs the way that,\nvia the discourse principle, the form of law in modern\u2014that is,\npost-traditional and post-conventional\u2014societies functions to\ncompensate for the loss of shared traditions, and relieves the burden\non citizens to reach reasoned agreement with one another and thereby\ncoordinate their actions (Baynes 2016: 166: Zurn 2011).\n\nSome critics argue that Habermas is wrong to look for a justification\nof basic rights that is functionalist, or merely \u201cinternal to\nlaw\u201d, one that sees them only as necessary conditions for the\ninstitutionalization of the democratic process, or one that is\nstrongly constructivist, that begins from slender premises that eschew\nmoral or ethical considerations (Forst 2011; Larmore 1995; Michelman\n1998; Bernstein 1996; and Cohen 1999; cf. Flynn 2003). The upshot of\nsuch criticisms is that Habermas\u2019s justification of the system\nof rights requires stronger normative support of one kind or another,\nand that political legitimacy is not entirely sui\ngeneris.\n\nRawls, Cohen, and Larmore argue in addition that Habermas\u2019s\npolitical theory rests on what Rawls calls a \u201ccomprehensive\ndoctrine\u201d since it is based on a controversial theory of meaning\nand communication and a controversial doctrine of method (Rawls 1995:\n139; Cohen 1999; Larmore 1995). However, there is an important\ndifference between comprehensive philosophical doctrines and\ncomprehensive moral, ethical or religious doctrines. The fact that a\nnormative political theory has controversial philosophical\nassumptions, which almost all do, does not create the kind of\npractical problems that arise when a political system, or\nconstitution, is saddled with controversial moral or religious\nassumptions, and its citizens cannot regard it as legitimate (Lister\n2007). To make that claim is to presuppose that political theory\nanswers to the same canons of justification as political systems\n(Laden 2010).\n5. Methodology and Philosophical Framework\n\nIn the transitional period of the 1970s when Habermas began his\ncommunicative turn, he developed various ideas about method that came\nto shape his mature work: for example, rational reconstruction\n (\u00a75.1)\n as a method for critical social theory, postmetaphysical thinking\n (\u00a75.2)\n as a framework for philosophy, and a set of related views about the\nproper role of philosophy.\n5.1 Rational Reconstruction\n\nRational reconstruction is the method, and the label, for a cluster of\nmethodological assumptions shaping the major philosophical projects of\nHabermas\u2019s middle period: the theory of communicative action,\ndiscourse ethics, and the discourse theory of law and democracy. He\noriginally developed it as part of an attempt to explain social\nphenomena and to recalibrate critical social theory on the basis of\nformal pragmatics.\n\nRational reconstruction is an approach that Habermas developed on the\nmodel of Noam Chomsky\u2019s universal grammar (1976b [1998b 1: 35]),\nJean Piaget\u2019s developmental psychology, and Lawrence\nKohlberg\u2019s moral psychology (1983 [1990: 33\u201341]). These\nare theories that reconstruct universal human capacities\u2014for\nlanguage acquisition, cognitive development, and moral reasoning,\nrespectively. Habermas\u2019s use of rational reconstruction aims to\nset out the structures, rules, and competences underlying lifeworld\npractices. The targets of the method may also be described as the\nidealizing, counterfactual commitments which participants in a\npractice must make, in order for the practice to be meaningful or\nrational for them (1999a [2003a: 85\u20136]; 2005b chapter 3 [2008a:\n81\u20134]). To rationally reconstruct a practice is to turn the\nimplicit \u201cknow how\u201d of participants into explicit\n\u201cknow that\u201d (1976b [1998b: 33, 34\u20135]). For example,\nrationally reconstructing the everyday practice of communication gives\naccess not to the semantic content of the speaker\u2019s\nparticular utterances, which is already explicitly known, but the\nimplicitly known rules which the speaker follows in\nsuccessfully communicating (1976b [1998b: 33]). Habermas calls this\n\u201cillocutionary\u201d or \u201cpragmatic\u201d meaning.\n\nThese underlying structures are\n\n\nbrought to consciousness through the choice of suitable examples and\ncounterexamples, through contrast and similarity relations, through\ntranslation, paraphrase and so on\u2014that is, through a well\nthought out, maieutic method of interrogation. (1976b [1998b: 40])\n\n\nThey are revealed not as timeless constants, but as they have\ndeveloped over time, with their internal developmental logics\n(Pedersen 2008: 463, 474\u20139). Habermas originally claimed that\nrational reconstruction uncovers knowledge of universal human\ncapabilities, \u201cspecies competences\u201d, rather than the\ncompetences of particular groups or individuals (1976b [1998b:\n34\u20135]; McCarthy 1991: 130\u20132). For example, rationally\nreconstructing the practice of everyday speech uncovers the rules of\ncommunicative action as such, not the grammar of a particular\nlanguage. However, Habermas\u2019s later description of the discourse\ntheory of law and democracy as a rational reconstruction of \u201cthe\nself-understanding of modern legal orders\u201d of democratic\nconstitutional states (1992b [1996b: 82], emphasis removed), evidently\na local phenomenon, suggests that he has since modified the scope of\nthe reconstructive method. Commentators are dividend on this point,\nwith some distinguishing between an \u201cempirical\u201d variety of\nreconstruction on display in the Theory of Communicative\nAction, and a \u201cnormative\u201d variety in Between\nFacts and Norms (Peters 1994: 119), and others arguing that the\nsame methodology underlies both projects (Patberg 2014: 511\u20133;\nhowever, see Gaus 2013: 561). This tension is partly resolved if we\nremember that democratic law-making draws on general communicative\ncompetencies, and makes use of pragmatic, ethical, and moral\ndiscourses. The phenomenon is local, but the capacities involved are\ngeneral.\n\nIn terms of his own work, formal pragmatics rationally reconstructs\nthe communicative capacities possessed by all human beings, making\nthem explicit in Habermas\u2019s accounts of communicative action and\nthe rules for redeeming validity claims (1976b [1998b: 22\u20134]).\nThe discourse theory of morality does this for our capacity for\nengaging in moral discourse, formalizing this in the (D) and (U)\nprinciples (1983 [1990a: chapter 2: 37, chapter 4: 174\u20135]),\nwhile the discourse theory of law and democracy does the same for the\npractice of lawmaking in democratic constitutional states, formalizing\nthis in the system of rights and the principle of democracy (1992b\n[1996b: 110\u20131, 118\u201324, 287]). Importantly, Habermas claims\nthat the theories produced by these processes of rational\nreconstruction have the status of falsifiable\nhypotheses\u2014they are not a priori since they are\nnot necessary claims, although they are supposed to be\n\u201cuniversal\u201d in the sense that they are, at present,\nwithout alternatives. Habermas sometimes refers to them having a\n\u201cweakly transcendental\u201d status.\n\nWhether or not formal pragmatics accurately describes the practice of\nhuman communication can only be decided a posteriori, by the\nfuture \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure\u201d of the theory as\nan input in further empirical investigations (1976b [1998b: 39]; 1983\n[1990: 32]), with Habermas suggesting coherence between theories as\nthe criterion of success (1981 [1987: 399\u2013400]; 1983 [1990a:\nchapter 2, 39]). J\u00f8rgen Pedersen has argued that it is still\nnot clear what constitutes success and failure in this context, and\nthus not fully clear how rationally reconstructed theories can be\ntested (Pedersen 2008: 478\u20131). Karl-Otto Apel, similarly,\nquestions what it would mean to falsify the \u201cunavoidable\npresuppositions of argumentation\u201d itself (Apel 2002: 19).\n\nHabermas claims that knowledge of the underlying structures and\ncompetences acquired through rational reconstruction can then be used\nfor the purposes of social critique. Supposedly, a version of a\npractice can be identified as pathological, or not fully rationalized,\nif it does not meet the counterfactual idealization which the practice\npresupposes (1983 [1990: 31\u20132]). Habermas thus identifies\nsystematically distorted communication, invalid moral norms, and\nillegitimate laws as deficits in communicative action, moral\ndiscourse, and democratic lawmaking, respectively. Rational\nreconstruction allows us to critique these actual practices according\nto their own internal standards, rather than the critic\u2019s\narbitrarily chosen standards or the philosopher\u2019s supposedly\ntranscendental standards (1992b [1996b: 5]). Similarly, the\ndevelopmental logic revealed by rational reconstruction can be used to\nevaluate processes of historical development as progressive examples\nof collective learning, or as regressive and pathological. As a method\nfor explaining social phenomena, rational reconstruction is neither\nmerely empirical nor hermeneutic; the principles it produces are\nsupposed to ground a kind of social and political theory which is\nneither \u201cideal\u201d nor \u201creal\u201d, but somewhere in\nbetween. Habermas\u2019s claim that philosophy can find within\ntraditions construed as learning processes a \u201cstandpoint of\ncritical evaluation\u201d (1996a essay 3 [1998a: 97]; 1992b [1996b:\n5]) is certainly in the spirit of critical theory, but arguably in\ntension with his other claims that that philosophy should \u201climit\nitself to the clarification of the moral point of view and the\nprocedure of democratic legitimation\u201d (Habermas 1995: 131;\nFinlayson 2019: 205).\n5.2 Postmetaphysical Thinking\n\nPostmetaphysical thinking, Habermas\u2019s paradigm for modern\nphilosophy, must be understood through contrast with its predecessor,\nmetaphysics. He labels much of the history of Western philosophy as\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d, counting Parmenides, Plato, Plotinus,\nAugustin, Aquinas, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Hegel as metaphysical\nthinkers (1988b essay 2 [1992a: 12\u201313]; 1988b essay 3 [1992a:\n29]). He sometimes distinguishes between metaphysics proper and the\n\u201cphilosophy of consciousness\u201d or \u201cphilosophy of the\nsubject\u201d associated with the rationalism of Descartes and the\nidealism of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling (1988b essay 3 [1992a: 31];\n1988b essay 8 [1992a:, 158\u201362]), though it is not clear whether\nthis should be considered a separate paradigm (1988b essay 2 [1992a:\n12\u201313]) or simply a late stage of metaphysics.\n\nAmong the characteristics of metaphysics are:\n\nA conception of philosophy as the queen of the sciences,\nwith its own unique method and form of knowledge, distinct from the\nnatural and social sciences, which can yield special insights into the\nnature of reality and the meaning of life. Plato\u2019s theory of\nforms is an excellent example of this, since Plato thinks that\nphilosophy, with its dialectical method, can offer true knowledge\n(episteme) of the forms, superior to mere opinion\n(doxa) about the material world.\nA substantive conception of reason as an Archimedean\npoint from which the philosopher can observe reality as a whole.\nThe metaphysical philosopher\u2019s goal is to attain an\nobserver\u2019s perspective on reality, from which they can learn\nuniversal and necessary truths. Philosophy can thus act as the judge\nand arbiter of both science and culture (1983 [1990: 2\u20133]).\nIdealism and identity thinking (1988b essay 3 [1992a:\n29\u201331]). Metaphysics assumes that ideas are primary and the\nmaterial world secondary, and that to grasp the underlying\nintellectual reality is to grasp the whole: \u201cthe structures of\nbeing themselves are what is laid hold of in knowledge\u201d (1988b\nessay 2 [1992a: 13). Again, Plato\u2019s theory of forms is a prime\nexample.\nFor philosophy of consciousness, the use of strong\ntranscendental arguments to ground claims about the nature of\nreality on the individual subject\u2019s self-knowledge. Habermas\nthinks that this turn to introspective self-knowledge as foundational\ntook place as a result of the pressure which natural science was\nputting on metaphysics by the eighteenth century. It may no longer be\nplausible that the individual subject can grasp \u201cthe structures\nof being themselves\u201d in thought, but they can at least grasp the\nstructure of their own thoughts, and build on these foundations some\ncertainty about the world. Kant\u2019s transcendental unity of\napperception (1988b essay 7 [1992a: 124\u20135]) and refutation of\nidealism in the First Critique are the clearest examples.\n\n\nHabermas concedes that this is a stipulative definition of\nmetaphysical philosophy, focused on idealism. Ancient materialism and\nscepticism, medieval nominalism, and modern empiricism do not fit the\nmould, but Habermas argues that they should be seen as\n\u201cantimetaphysical countermovements\u201d within the horizon of\nmetaphysics (1988b essay 3 [1992a: 29]). He often characterises modern\nphilosophical trends of which he is critical as covertly metaphysical.\nHabermas sees some trends as attempted breaks with metaphysics which\nremain trapped within the paradigm (Nietzsche, Heidegger,\nDerrida\u20141981 [1987: 83\u2013105, 131\u2013160,\n161\u2013184]), others as still being mired in the philosophy of\nconsciousness (Niklas Luhmann\u2019s systems theory\u20141981 [1987:\n368\u2013385]), and other again as deliberate attempts to return to\nthe philosophy of consciousness (Dieter Henrich\u2014 1988b essay 2\n[1992a: 10\u201327]).\n\nPostmetaphysical thinking begins with the first generation of\npost-Hegelian thinkers (Feuerbach, Marx, Kierkegaard) (1988b essay 3\n[1992a: 39]), and includes pragmatists such as C.S. Peirce and G.H.\nMead, speech-act theorists such as J.L. Austin and John Searle, the\nlater Wittgenstein, and Karl-Otto Apel.\n\nAmong the characteristics of postmetaphysical thinking are:\n\n\n\nRational reconstruction as a method (1988b essay 3 [1998b:\n38]). Since rational reconstruction is also used by many of the social\nsciences, philosophy is no longer seen as unique in its method and\nform of knowledge, but simply as one discipline among others.\nPostmetaphysical philosophy has no priority over the natural and\nsocial sciences, but neither is it subordinate to them. It opposes\nscientism, the idea that the natural sciences have unique authority\nand privileged access to the truth. \n\n\nA \u201cweak but not defeatistic (sic) concept of\nlinguistically embodied reason\u201d (1988b essay 7 [1992a: 142]).\nPostmetaphysical philosophy conceives of reason as being historically,\nsocially, and linguistically situated, embedded in the intersubjective\ncommunicative processes of the lifeworld, rather than transcending\nthem. The philosopher is a participant in these processes, not an\noutside observer. Postmetaphysical reason is immanent in the\ncommunicative practices of the lifeworld, and procedural (1988b essay\n3 [1992a: 34\u20135]), rather than being the external Archimedean\npoint of metaphysics. Habermas thus sees postmetaphysical thinking as\nhaving a detranscendentalized conception of reason. \n\n\nThe use of weak transcendental arguments, rather than the\nstrong transcendental arguments of metaphysics (Yates 2011:\n41\u20134). Benhabib defines strong transcendental arguments as ones\nwhich aim to\n\n\n(prove) the necessity and singularity of certain conditions without\nwhich some aspect of our world, conduct, and consciousness\ncould not be what it is.\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 cogito and Kant\u2019s refutation of\nidealism are examples, aiming to prove the existence of the subject\nand of the external world. Weak transcendental arguments, in contrast,\nfocus on lifeworld practices such as communicative action, moral\ndiscourse, and democratic deliberation (rather than experience as\nsuch), and\n\n\ndemonstrate more modestly that certain conditions need to be fulfilled\nfor us to judge those practices to be of a certain sort rather than of\na different kind. (Benhabib 2002: 38)\n\n\nUnlike strong transcendental arguments, weak transcendental arguments\nare both a posteriori, since they are based on rationally\nreconstructed experience, and falsifiable, since they can be refuted\nby further empirical experience (1976b [1998b: 42]). \n\n\nThe ability to provide context-transcending validity, despite\nabandoning metaphysical philosophy\u2019s search for universal\nnecessary truths. Validity claims are the clearest example (1988b\nessay 7 [1992a: 142]; 1983 [1990: 19, 203]). Although they are always\nadvanced from within a particular lifeworld context, they hold that a\ncertain thing is morally right for the intersubjective world, or true\nfor the objective world, as a whole. The claims raised are not just\nvalid within the context of the interlocutors raising them, but for\nall speaking and acting subjects, as they must be if postmetaphysical\nphilosophy is to critique existing social and political conditions\n(1988b essay 3 [1992a: 50]). Habermas speaks in this context of the\n\u201cimmanent transcendence\u201d or \u201ctranscendence from\nwithin\u201d of language (2005c). \n\n\nModesty with regard to ethical and ontological claims (Rees\n2018: 55\u20136, 60\u20132). Although it can clarify the procedures\nof moral discourse, it should refrain from making substantive\ncontributions to ethical discourse (1988b essay 3 [1992a: 50]; 1988d\n[1990a chapter 5, 211]). Unlike metaphysical philosophy, it refrains\nfrom making ontological claims about matters such as the existence of\nGod. In accordance with the postsecular orientation of\nHabermas\u2019s recent work, postmetaphysical philosophy remains\nagnostic about such matters, while being open to the truth-contents of\nreligious language. \n\n\nThe metaphysical philosopher is an isolated figure, aiming through the\nuse of their individual reason to attain a neutral observer\u2019s\nperspective on reality as a whole and produce knowledge of universal,\nnecessary truths. The postmetaphysical philosopher, in contrast, aims\nat a participant\u2019s perspective, working in dialogue with the\nnatural and social sciences and making use of a situated, procedural\nconception of reason. There is no transcendent Archimedean point for\nthe philosopher to occupy, since we are all embedded in our lifeworlds\nand our thinking conditioned by social, historical, and linguistic\nfactors. What remains distinctive about philosophy as a discipline is\nthat it can step back from the particular questions which the natural\nand social sciences focus on and produce general knowledge about the\nhuman condition; but this knowledge is now based on empirical data and\nrational reconstructions, and as such is contestable and revisable.\nPostmetaphysical philosophy no longer claims to be the role of judge\nand usher of science and culture, assigning each discipline and\ncultural practice to its proper place. Instead it acts as a\nplaceholder for fruitful collaborations between empirical research and\nphilosophical ideas, and as an interpreter mediating between the\nrationalized value-spheres of science, law, and art and the everyday\ndiscourse of the lifeworld (1983 [1990: 15\u20139]).\n6. Constitutional Patriotism, Cosmopolitanism, and International Law\n\nHabermas\u2019s views on national identity, the nation state, and\nglobal politics have been shaped by the historical experience of\nliving through the Third Reich, the division of Germany into East and\nWest, reunification, and the development of the European Union. The\nkey to his applied political theory\n\n\nconsists in differentiating between the three elements of statehood,\ndemocratic constitution, and civic solidarity, which are closely\nlinked in the historical form of the constitutional state. (2009\nchapter 7: 112)\n\n\nHabermas argues that the conjunction of these elements is contingent,\nnot necessary, and that in the \u201cpostnational\nconstellation\u201d of the late twentieth and early twenty-first\ncenturies they should be disaggregated. His theory of constitutional\npatriotism argues that civic solidarity need not be reduced to\nnational identity, but can rather be generated by the process of\nconstitution-making itself\n (\u00a76.1).\n With regard to the international arena, he argues that the\nconstitutionalization of international law can proceed without a\nglobal state, and, as such, cosmopolitans should aim at a\n\u201cpolitically-constituted world society\u201d (2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 161]) rather than a world republic\n (\u00a76.2).\n6.1 Constitutional Patriotism\n\nThe term \u201cconstitutional patriotism\u201d\n(Verfassungspatriotismus) was not coined by Habermas, but by\nthe political scientist Dolf Sternberger, who popularized it in a 1979\narticle marking the thirtieth anniversary of the Federal Republic of\nGermany (M\u00fcller 2006). Habermas took up the term and developed\nhis own distinct interpretation of it beginning with the\n\u201chistorians\u201d dispute\u2019 of 1986. Constitutional\npatriotism is the theory that in modern states the constitution can,\nand should, take the place of the nation as focus of citizens\u2019\nfeelings of collective identity and the source of their civic\nsolidarity. While originally concerned with specifically post-war West\nGerman questions about history and national identity (1988a), and thus\ndrawing on a rational reconstruction of the postnational form of\nidentification developed in the divided Germany, Habermas later\napplied the theory to modern states more generally, and to the\nEuropean Union in particular (1998c).\n\nNational identity, for Habermas, is a product of the modern era,\ndating from the time of the French Revolution and the later Romantic\nmovement. It was constructed by linguists, historians, and writers and\npropagated through the education system and the public sphere. As\nsuch, the nation is intermediate between traditional and\npost-traditional forms of identity (1988a: 5\u20137; 1992b [1996b:\n494\u20135]). In a traditional society, collective identity is\naccepted unreflexively, as are the society\u2019s conventional\nmorality and worldviews. It is a supposedly natural, pre-political\ngiven. Collective identity in post-traditional society, in contrast,\nis adopted in a reflexive manner, in light of reasons given in the\npublic sphere. While in reality post-traditional, the nation is\nreified as traditional and quasi-natural, and projected into a distant\npast. From the beginning, the nation played a political role in\ngenerating civic solidarity among strangers. National identity\nestablishes an abstract level of solidarity, transcending the\nface-to-face associations which bind people in traditional society:\nvillages, clans, and localities. The feeling that they belong to the\nsame nation motivates individuals to make sacrifices for others who\nthey have never met, whether in terms of redistributive taxation or\nmilitary service (1998c [2001a: 64\u20135]). This was crucial for the\nviability of democratic republics at the transition from traditional\nto post-traditional society. Nationhood provides the cultural\nsubstrate for the \u201cnation of citizens\u201d who govern\nthemselves democratically (1996a essay 4 [1998a: 117\u20138]). But,\nfor a number of reasons, the nation is less and less able to play this\nrole today. For one, all contemporary nation states are increasingly\nmulti-ethnic and multicultural, undermining the idea that a\npurportedly homogeneous collective identity can act as the substrate\nfor democracy. For another, the dangers of extreme ethnonationalism\nare all too obvious: they generate in-group/out-group distinctions\nthat can lead to discrimination, racism, and at the limit to ethnic\ncleansing and genocide. Finally, nation states themselves are\nincreasingly powerless in the face of factors outside their control,\nsuch as global capitalism and climate change. This \u201cpostnational\nconstellation\u201d requires a different form of social integration\n(1998c [2001a: 58\u2013112]).\n\nLuckily, according to Habermas, the relationship between\nconstitutional democracy and the nation is historically contingent\n(1992b [1996b: 495]; 1996a essay 5 [1998a: 132\u20133]; 1998c [2001a:\n76]). A modern society does not need anything as substantial as a\nshared religion, way of life, or repository of values to serve as the\nbasis of collective identity. A democratic political system can\ngenerate its own civic solidarity. Supposing that individuals have\nprogressed from a traditional to a post-traditional level of identity\nand are willing to adopt a more reflexive understanding of their\nidentity, the constitution can replace the nation as a source of civic\nsolidarity and attachment. The democratic procedure of\nconstitution-making not only produces legitimacy, as described in the\ndiscourse theory of law and democracy, but can also serve as the basis\nof belonging. The goal of constitutional patriotism is not, then, to\neliminate national identity, but rather to decentre\nit and deprive it of its political function. In concrete terms,\nconstitutional patriotism involves citizens developing critical and\nreflexive loyalties and attachments to their country\u2019s\nconstitution and the moral principles encoded therein. What results\nfrom this is a collective identity with a political function.\nCitizens\u2019 status as joint makers and interpreters of the same\nconstitution takes the place of their shared natality and status as\nco-nationals. This view is constitutional in that it revolves\naround the work of making, interpreting, and reflecting on the\nconstitution, which takes place in the public sphere. It is\npatriotic in that it has a binding effect on the community of\ncitizens, furnishing them with civic solidarity and a collective\nidentity. The formation of constitutional-patriotic identity,\nsignificantly, takes place at the level of opinion- and will-formation\nin the public sphere. Unlike supposedly natural and pre-political\nnational identity, it is formed in the light of rational discourse\n(2004 chapter 6 [2006c: 76\u20139]).\n\nCritics of constitutional patriotism argue that it is either too\n\u201cthin\u201d to play the role Habermas assigns to it, or too\n\u201cthick\u201d to really be postnational and open to all, as he\nclaims (Hayward 2007: 186\u20139). The first criticism is that the\nuniversal moral principles encoded in constitutions are too abstract\nand affectively thin to generate a sense of personal loyalty and\ncollective belonging among citizens, compared to the thick bonds of\nnational identity (1996a essay 5 [1998a: 132]; Canovan 2000). Habermas\nrejects this criticism. Citizens interpret the principles found in\ntheir constitution\u2014which represent universal moral and political\nnorms of democracy and human rights, and might be found in any\nliberal-democratic constitution\u2014in the light of their\ncommunity\u2019s unique historical experience. They internalize\nthese principles, not abstractly, but in the context of the history of\ntheir country (1996a essay 8 [1998a: 225\u20136]). Constitutional\nprinciples become part of the \u201cdense web\u201d of a\nsociety\u2019s (and an individual\u2019s) historical experiences and\npre-political values (2004 chapter 6 [2006c: 77\u20138]). It follows\nthat each country\u2019s constitutional patriotism will be different,\ninflected by the particular past that country has worked\nthrough\u2014Habermas notes that French constitutional patriotism,\nmarked by a tradition of revolutionary democracy, will be different to\nGerman constitutional patriotism, marked by the historical failure to\nproduce a working democracy (1992h: 240\u20131). Far from being an\nabstract, bloodless construct as critics have alleged, Habermas sees\nconstitutional patriotism as intimately connected to each\ncommunity\u2019s particular history and culture, and to its concerns\nabout identity and the common good\u2014its ethical-political\nself-understanding.\n\n\nThe same universalistic content must each time be appropriated from\nout of one\u2019s own specific historical life-situation, and become\nanchored in one\u2019s own cultural form of life. Every collective\nidentity, even a post-national one, is much more concrete than the\nensemble of moral, legal and political principles around which it\ncrystallizes. (1992h: 241)\n\n\nThe second criticism is that supposedly constitutional-patriotic\nidentity is, in reality, the thick identity of the dominant majority\nculture, albeit disguised (Laborde 2002: 593\u20139).\nHabermas\u2019s argument that constitutional principles are\ninterpreted in the light of particular histories plays into this\ncriticism. If a particular country\u2019s constitutional patriotism\nis so closely bound up with its ethical-political self-understanding,\nthen the language, culture, beliefs, and values of that\ncountry\u2019s majority culture will make a deep impression on it.\nConstitutional patriotism consequently collapses into civic\nnationalism. At the same time, Habermas\u2019s claim that the\nconnection between national identity and constitutional democracy is\nmerely contingent holds open the possibility that, even if they have\noverlapped in the past and the present, an ongoing learning process\nmay lead to the two being fully decoupled in the future (1998c [2001a:\n101\u20132]). A further question, articulated by Andrea Baumeister\namong others, is whether the liberal-democratic values which are to be\ninterpreted in the light of national histories are, in fact, as widely\naccepted as Habermas believes (Baumeister 2007: 491\u20135). If not,\nconstitutional patriotism may be more particularistic and Eurocentric\nthan it at first appears, raising questions about how those who do not\nadhere to such values are to be integrated into\nconstitutional-patriotic polities.\n\nHabermas\u2019s longstanding support for a European constitution\n(2001c [2006g]; 1996a essay 6 [1998a]) can be explained by his hope\nthat a European constitutional patriotism would provide the civic\nsolidarity that would allow the transnational polity of the European\nUnion to fulfil its democratic potential (2004 chapter 6 [2006c]).\n6.2 Cosmopolitanism and the Constitutionalization of International Law\n\nHabermas\u2019s views on international politics are characterised by\na revision of Kant\u2019s cosmopolitanism, and a total rejection of\nCarl Schmitt\u2019s conception of the political as irreducibly\nantagonistic (1996a essay 7 [1998a: 193\u2013201]; 2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 188\u201393]). After some early explorations (1996a essay 7\n[1998a]), he rejects a Kantian version of cosmopolitanism, arguing for\na \u201cpolitically constituted world society\u201d (2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 161]) rather than a world republic or a global federation. His\nfocus is the \u201cconstitutionalization of international law\u201d\n(2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 132\u20135]) without a world\ngovernment, with the limited aims of ensuring peace and protecting\nhuman rights, rather than democracy on a global scale. Habermas pays\nparticular attention to the different types of legitimation which\ndifferent levels of global governance would require, and the different\ntypes of constitution they would need.\n\nIn Perpetual Peace, Kant looks forward to the transformation\nof international law, with states as its subjects, into cosmopolitan\nlaw, with global citizens as its subjects. Habermas, in contrast,\nargues that cosmopolitan law must be dualistic, with both states\nand individuals as its subjects. The cosmopolitan community\nis dualistic in the sense that it is a community of both human beings\n(individual subjects), and states (collective subjects) (2004 chapter\n8 [2006c: 135]; 2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 317]). Both can act as the\nfounding subjects of a world constitution (2009 chapter 7: 119; 2011\n[2012: 58]).\n\nHabermas describes \u201ca multilevel political system that does not\nassume a state-like character as a whole\u201d (2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 144]), divided into three levels (2005b chapter 11 [2008a:\n322\u20137]), each with its own form of legitimation and type of\nconstitution:\n\nNational: nation states (2009 chapter 7:\n115\u20136). Although they are no longer fully sovereign in a\nglobalized world, states still have the monopoly on the use of force\nwithin their territories. They are based on a defined self-legislating\ndemos (\u201cnational\u201d or otherwise), which gives itself laws\nby following democratic procedures, thus linking the rule of law to\ndemocracy. In other words, states have a more \u201crepublican\u201d\ntype of constitution, which gives a central role to popular\nsovereignty established in a revolutionary moment (1998d [2001a:\n116\u20138]; 2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 122]). They can have full\ndemocratic legitimacy, as described in Between Facts and\nNorms, since within a state the authors of law can also be its\naddressees (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 141]). States have the highest\nrequirements of legitimacy within Habermas\u2019s model. They have\ntwo functions: firstly, to provide military force for implementing\nhuman rights and policy decisions of the higher levels (2005b chapter\n11 [2008a: 320\u2013321]), and secondly, to generate indirect\npolitical legitimacy for the higher levels.\nTransnational: continental blocs like the EU,\nHabermas\u2019s prime example of a transnational polity, along with\nits less-integrated siblings such as ASEAN and Mercosur (2005b chapter\n11 [2008a: 325\u20136]). Great powers such as the USA, China, Russia,\nand India also operate at the transnational level (2009 chapter 7:\n114), as do economic organizations such as the WTO, IMF, and World\nBank; and UN agencies such as the WHO and UNESCO (2011 [2012: 56]).\nThis is the most \u201cpluralist\u201d level in Habermas\u2019s\nmodel, since it contains very different types of polities, and\nincludes ones which are both liberal and illiberal, democratic and\nnon-democratic. At the transnational level there exists a\n\u201cglobal domestic politics\u201d (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 136,\n160]) addressing socioeconomic questions. Issues of wealth and\nredistribution, health and disease, trade, migration, and\nenvironmental policy can be discussed within and between transnational\npolities. Habermas still considers relations in and between them to\ncount as international relations or foreign policy, although recourse\nto war should be ruled out (2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 325]). The\nnormative yardstick for relations between transnational polities is\nfair negotiation, not the full democratic legitimacy which can exist\nwithin states (2009 chapter 7: 125\u20136; 2011 [2012: 57, 68]). They\nare nonetheless open to the influence of deliberative publics from\nbelow, and should institutionalize some degree of citizen\nparticipation, via referenda or mechanisms for responding to\ntransnational public spheres. Transnational polities also receive some\nindirect legitimation in virtue of their member states being\nlegitimate (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 142]). They thus have middling\nrequirements of legitimacy, which can be generated in a number of\ndirect and indirect ways, and may have several different types of\nconstitutions.\nSupranational: global organizations with\nuniversal membership, comprising both individuals and states as\nmembers. Habermas envisages a reformed United Nations as the central\ncomponent of the supranational layer, along with a stronger version of\nthe International Criminal Court (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 133\u20134,\n173\u20134]). Their remit is strictly to secure peace and prevent\nhuman rights violations (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 136]; 2005b chapter 11\n[2008a: 322]; 2011 [2012: 60\u20131]), with the security council\nperforming an executive function, the ICC a judicial function, and the\nUN Charter acting as a supranational constitution (2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 160\u20131]; 2009 chapter 7: 120). A reformed General\nAssembly could function as a world parliament, containing\nrepresentatives of both states and cosmopolitan citizens (2009 chapter\n7: 120\u20131), with its deliberations focused on interpreting and\nelaborating the meaning of the Charter, rather than the kind of\npolitical will-formation which takes place within national parliaments\n(2011 [2012: 60\u20131, 65]). All other cross-border political issues\nshould be dealt with at the transnational level\u2014the\nsupranational level is the preserve of law, rather than politics\n(2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 333\u20134, 343]; 2011 [2012: 65]).\n\n\nThis division of labour has drawn criticism, with Cristina Lafont\narguing that the relegation of all socioeconomic issues to the\ntransnational layer ensures that human rights violations stemming from\nglobal inequality cannot be addressed (Lafont 2008). Habermas\u2019s\nsuggestion that the \u201cslender but robust\u201d cross-cultural\nconsensus on basic human rights is enough to legitimate the\nsupranational level\u2019s policies (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 143];\n2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 343\u20134]) has also been criticized. There\nis room for doubt on this point, especially with regard to contentious\ncases such as LGBT rights (1998d [2001a: 113\u2013129]; Scheuerman\n2008: 143\u20135).\n\nSince it is neither democratic nor a state, the supranational level\nhas the lowest requirements of legitimacy (2004 chapter 8 [2006c:\n133\u20134, 143]; 2011 [2012: 65]), and is not suited to a republican\ntype of constitution, contra Kant. It is suited to a liberal type of\nconstitution, which prioritizes the rule of law rather than popular\nsovereignty (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 137\u20139]). A liberal\nconstitution constrains established power in accordance with human\nrights, but does not connect it to the will of a self-legislating\ndemos, which is in any case lacking at the global level (2005b chapter\n11 [2008a: 316]). Instead, the supranational level derives its\nlegitimacy directly from the negative duties which it enforces (to\nprevent human rights abuses and wars of aggression), and indirectly\nfrom the legitimacy of the states which comprise it (2004 chapter 8\n[2006c: 140\u20131, 143]; 2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 342\u20134]).\nThis may be supplemented by the periodic emergence of a global public\nsphere, mobilised in opposition to wars of aggression or in\ncondemnation of gross human rights violations (2004 chapter 8 [2006c:\n142]; 2005b chapter 11 [2008a: 343\u20134]; 2009 chapter 7:\n124\u20135).\n\nIn this model, supranational law is to have primacy over state law, in\nmuch the same way that EU law has primacy over the laws of member\nstates (2004 chapter 8 [2006c: 137]). The plausibility of\nHabermas\u2019s proposals depends on two learning processes.\nIndividuals must learn to think and act as both national and\ncosmopolitan citizens, switching between a perspective that centres\nnational interest and one that centres universal standards of justice\n(2009 chapter 7: 116\u20138), while states must learn to regard\nthemselves as members of an international community, not absolute\nsovereigns (2011 [2012: 61]). Habermas regards the\nconstitutionalization of international law as the \u201clegal\ndomestication of the intensified cooperation between states\u201d\n(2014: 8), by which the Hobbesian state of nature at the global level\ncan be gradually regulated and subject to law without the need for a\nglobal government, which could not in any case be fully legitimate.\nSome degree of global governance is unavoidable in the contemporary\npostnational constellation. What is crucial is that it should be\nconstitutional and grounded in universal moral principles, rather than\na technocracy at the service of neoliberal capitalism.\n7. Religion and Postsecularism\n\nHabermas\u2019s views about religion and its place in modern society\nhave changed strikingly over the course of his career. In a series of\ntexts written mostly after 2001 he revises the secularist bent of his\nearlier social and political theory, as expressed in Theory of\nCommunicative Action and Between Facts and Norms, so as\nto acknowledge religion\u2019s close relation to philosophy and the\ncentral place of religious believers in democratic states.\n\nInfluenced by Weber and Durkheim, Habermas had earlier characterised\nreligious beliefs as the worldviews of traditional societies that in\nthe course of rationalisation are superseded and replaced by secular\nforms. In religious belief the validity claims of objective truth,\nmoral rightness, and sincerity, and along with them the objective,\nintersubjective, and subjective world-relations, were fused together.\nSpeakers could not thematize and contest them (1981 [1984a: 214]; 1981\n[1987: 189]). This fusion, maintained by the strict segregation of\nsacred from profane domains of life, enabled a normative consensus to\ncrystallize by non-discursive means (1981 [1987: 54]). That which was\nin accord with society\u2019s ritually protected normative consensus\nwas right, that which violated it was wrong, and the consensus itself\nwas beyond questioning. The transition to modernity begins with the\n\u201clinguistification of the sacred\u201d, in which \u201cthe\nauthority of the holy is gradually replaced by the authority of an\nachieved consensus\u201d (1981 [1987: 77, see also 288]). Normative\nconsensus and social integration are achieved in modern societies\nthrough communicative action, carried out by competent speaking and\nacting subjects who have mastered all three validity claims and\nworld-relations (1981 [1987: 107, 145]). The sacred, the lynchpin of\nreligious worldviews, has dissolved into unrestricted discourse, in\nwhich any validity claim may be contested. Religious belief may\ncontinue to exist, but it is now one worldview among many, and like\nevery other social practice it must be continued by means of\ncommunicative action (1981 [1987: 88\u20139]).\n\nHabermas at this stage saw post-traditional society as secular (1992b\n[1996b: 443\u20134]). He subsequently rejected this view, stating\nthat\n\n\nMy earlier Hegelian view of religion as a formation destined to be\ndialectically superseded in the modern world has indeed changed. The\nempirical evidence of the survival of religion under modern conditions\nhas accumulated in recent decades. (2012 chapter 6 [2017: 143])\n\n\nHis most recent work paints a very different picture of the role of\nritual and the sacred (2012 chapter 3 [2017]), revising many of his\ncentral claims in the Theory of Communicative Action. Aside\nfrom these revisions to his social theory, Habermas\u2019s\npostsecular writings address the philosophical theme of the\nrelationship between religious faith and philosophical reason\n (\u00a77.1)\n as well as the political theme of religion\u2019s place within\ndeliberative democracy\n (\u00a77.2).\n7.1 Jerusalem and Athens: Religious Faith and Philosophical Reason\n\nHabermas has, since phase two of discourse ethics in the 1990s,\nconsidered religious traditions in modern societies to be fruitful\nsources of ethical values (1983 [1990]; 2001b chapter 1 [2003b]).\nSince postmetaphysical philosophy refrains from proposing concrete\nvisions of the good, modern subjects must \u201cappropriate\u201d or\n\u201ctranslate\u201d insights from religion (alongside art and\nliterature) to use as inputs in their ethical-existential and\nethical-political discourses. Maeve Cooke suggests that this process\nof ethical appropriation involves re-presenting the semantic contents\nof ethical insights, shorn of their religious, literary, and artistic\ncontexts, such that their exemplary force in disclosing visions of the\ngood remains intact and can be used in secular ethical discourses\n(Cooke 2011).\n\nPhilosophy, too, has a long history of appropriating or translating\nconcepts from religious traditions (2012 chapter 4 [2017:\n63\u20134]). Many apparently secular philosophical ideas have\ngenealogies stretching back to religion. Alongside well-known examples\nsuch as Schelling and Hegel\u2019s concept of the Absolute (2005c:\n304), Benjamin\u2019s use of the Messiah, and Adorno\u2019s use of\nthe ban on graven images (2005b chapter 8 [2008a: 232]), Habermas\ndiscusses several examples from Kant: the summum bonum, the\nethical community, moral faith, radical evil, and even the moral law\nitself can be seen as secular philosophical translations of the\nkingdom of God, the church, religious faith, original sin, and the Ten\nCommandments (2001b chapter 2 [2003b: 110]; 2005b chapter 11 [2008a:\n220\u20133, 224\u20136]). Habermas lists universal egalitarianism\nand communicative action (2002 chapter 8: 149, 160) as concepts from\nhis own work which have religious genealogies. Although some of the\noriginal concepts\u2019 meaning is inevitably lost in translation\n(2005c: 309; 2002 chapter 8: 164), such \u201ccritical\nassimilation(s) of religious concepts\u201d or\n\u201csecularizing, but at the same time salvaging, deconstruction(s)\nof religious truths\u201d (2003c: 110) can enrich the vocabulary of\npostmetaphysical philosophy (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 142]). Despite\nthis, Habermas insists that philosophical discourse itself remains\nsecular, retaining its \u201cmethodological atheism\u201d (2005c:\n304, 309; 2002 chapter 8: 160)\u2014it appropriates religious\nconcepts, but they do not remain religious concepts. They\nmust be contestable in justificatory discourses.\n\nThese conceptual appropriations link the apparently secular\nphilosophical tradition to the major world religions, and focusing on\nthem helps to establish a new postsecular self-understanding of\nphilosophy. Nonetheless, the process of appropriation could be said to\nplace philosophy in a superior position to religion. It seems as if\nphilosophy is able to judge which elements of religion count as\nrational enough to be worth appropriating, and which can be discarded\nas irrational; religion is reduced to a fund of concepts for\nphilosophy\u2019s use (2012 chapter 4 [2017: 63]). Habermas resists\nthis interpretation, arguing against a Kantian view in which pure\nrational faith should eventually replace historical faiths (2005b\nchapter 8 [2008a: 223]), or a Hegelian view in which religion is one\nmoment in the dialectic of absolute spirit, soon to be sublated into\nphilosophy (2005b chapter 8 [2008a: 230\u20131]). A truly\npostsecular self-understanding of philosophy, he claims, must move\nbeyond this.\n\nHabermas attempts to deflate philosophy\u2019s stance of superiority\nwith regard to religion by arguing that philosophical reason and\nreligious faith have a shared origin. Both originated in the Axial\nAge, the intellectual revolution which took place in Greece, Israel,\nIndia, and China between 800 and 200 BCE, as described by Karl Jaspers\n(Jaspers 1949 [1953]). This transition from mythos to\nlogos saw the emergence of universal, context-transcending\nthinking, and a deepening of human subjectivity and ethical thought.\nThe Western philosophical tradition beginning with Socrates, Plato,\nand Aristotle is as much an axial phenomenon as Judaism, Buddhism, and\nConfucianism (2012 chapter 4 [2017: 66\u20139]; Rees 2017:\n221\u20132). As Habermas puts it,\n\n\nboth modes, faith and knowledge, together with their traditions based\nrespectively in Jerusalem and Athens, belong to the history of the\norigins of the secular reason which today provides the medium in which\nthe sons and daughters of modernity communicate concerning their place\nin the world. (2008c [2010: 17])\n\n\nReligious faith is not, then, the \u201copaque other of reason\u201d\n(2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 142]). Rather than being hostile strangers,\nphilosophy and religion are in reality estranged siblings and equal\npartners in a fruitful dialogue (2008c [2010: 17\u201318]).\n7.2 Postsecular Deliberative Democracy\n\nIn writings since the turn of the millennium, Habermas adapts his\ndiscourse theory of law and democracy so as to take account of the\npostsecular nature of modern societies. He uses this expression\n\n\nto describe modern societies which must assume that religious groups\nwill continue to exist and that different religious traditions will\nremain relevant, even if the societies themselves are largely\nsecularized. (2012 chapter 4 [2017: 63])\n\n\nHis postsecular political theory, then, applies mostly to European and\nother Western countries with an established tradition of secular\ndemocracy, which must take account of the presence of religious\nminorities (2009 chapter 5: 59). One alleged problem with earlier\nmodels of deliberative democracy, such as those outlined by Rawls in\nPolitical Liberalism or by Habermas himself in Between\nFacts and Norms, is that they place unfair cognitive burdens on\nreligious citizens of secular states, and in doing so threaten to\nundermine these states\u2019 legitimacy. The central issue is the\nexclusion of religious language from the public sphere, and it can be\naddressed by modifying the discourse theory of law and democracy so as\nto let religious citizens participate fully. Habermas identifies two\nproblems with secular deliberative democracy. It forces religious\ncitizens to \u201csplit their identities\u201d between public\n(secular) and private (religious) personae (2005b chapter 5 [2008a:\n126\u20137, 130]), and places asymmetrical burdens upon them,\ncompared with their secular fellow citizens. Consider Rawls\u2019s\n\u201cduty of civility\u201d which required citizens not to make use\nof their comprehensive doctrines while deliberating in public, and to\nrestrict themselves to political conceptions of justice, which are\nwithin the bounds of public reason (Rawls 1995 [1996: 217]). Or\nconsider Rawls\u2019s later, more moderate view, namely the proviso\nwhich allows that citizens can adduce \u201ccomprehensive\nreasons\u201d in public political discussion, provided that \u201cin\ndue course\u201d these are replaced by proper political reasons\n(Rawls 1993 [2005: 462, l]). Following Paul Weithman and Nicholas\nWolterstorff (Weithman 2002; Audi & Wolterstorff 1997), Habermas\nobjects to Rawls\u2019s proviso for placing morally unacceptable\nburdens on citizens of faith, since\n\n\nmany religious citizens would not be able to undertake such an\nartificial division within their own minds without jeopardizing the\npious conduct of their lives. (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 127])\n\n\nHe also claims that burden is unfairly distributed, weighing only on\nbelievers (2001b chapter 2 [2003b: 109]; 2005b chapter 5 [2008a:\n136]). Some critics have countered that identity-splitting can also\naffect non-believers (Boettcher 2009; Holst & Molander 2015),\nwhile others rejoin that it is a reasonable demand to make of modern\ndemocratic citizens in pluralist societies, which does not threaten\ntheir complex identities (Mautner 2014: 24; Finlayson 2019: 11).\nHabermas, however, argues that both objections apply to Rawls\u2019s\nidea of public reason, governed by the proviso.\n\nNow, Habermas\u2019s account of legitimate law-making in Between\nFacts and Norms is wedded to the principle of the separation of\nchurch and state, and has an unabashedly secular conception of\npolitics. The principle of democracy implies that laws are legitimate\nwhen citizens\u2019 contributions to the informal public\nsphere filter through into the formal public sphere (the\nstate apparatus, parliaments, and legal systems), and influence\nlaw-making (1992b [1996b: 371\u20132, 441\u20132]). When this cycle\nof feedback is operating correctly, citizens can understand themselves\nas the \u201cauthors and addressees\u201d of the law (1992b [1996b:\n120]), since they have indirectly participated in the legislative\nprocess.\n\nHowever, religious citizens cannot contribute authentically to a\nsecular public sphere. Their contributions to public discourse, if\nphrased in secular language, will have little meaning for them, and\nthus they will find themselves in the heteronomous position of only\nbeing the addressees of the law, not its authors (2005b chapter 5\n[2008a: 128, 130]). Habermas fears that the secular nature of the\npublic sphere prevents religious citizens from fully taking part in\nthe discursive processes which legitimate laws. They might comply\nstrategically, seeing the law as a mere fact, and not a norm, but for\nthem the laws passed by secular democratic states would lack\nlegitimacy. There is evidently a danger here of large numbers of\nreligious believers becoming alienated from democratic law-making,\nwith the concomitant danger of political instability and a\nlegitimation crisis (2009 chapter 5: 76).\n\nThe problem is how to construe and design the modern political system\nin a way that is more congenial to religious citizens, without\nabandoning the secular political state, and how to show that the\nWeithman/Wolterstorff objections, which Habermas agrees apply\nRawls\u2019s proviso, do not apply to his own theory. His proposed\nsolution, a model of postsecular deliberative democracy, has\ntwo elements corresponding respectively to the formal and informal\npublic spheres; namely to the political system and civil society.\n\nFirst, echoing Rawls, Habermas proposes an \u201cinstitutional\ntranslation proviso\u201d at the threshold between the informal and\nformal public spheres. In the formal public sphere, public officials,\npoliticians, and judges must restrict themselves to secular language,\nbut in the informal public sphere, ordinary citizens are free to\ncontribute to public discourse in religious language (2009 chapter 5:\n76; 2005b chapter 5 [2008a 130\u20132]). Before these religious\nstatements pass through into the formal public sphere and impact the\nlegislative process, they are to be translated into secular terms, a\ncooperative task in which both religious and non-religious citizens\ntake part (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 112\u20133]; 2012 chapter 7 [2017:\n172]). The institutional translation proviso thus acts as a filter,\nmaintaining the secular nature of the state, but allowing religious\ncitizens free reign to air their religious reasons in informal public\ndiscourse (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 131]).\n\nSecond, religious and non-religious citizens in civil society must\nundergo complementary learning processes, leading to them becoming\nreflexive about their beliefs (2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 111\u20132]).\nFor religious believers, this involves coming to terms with three\naspects of modern society: reasonable pluralism, the priority of\nscientific knowledge, and the secular nature of the state (2001b\nchapter 2 [2003b: 104]; 2005b chapter 5 [2008a: 137]; 2012 chapter 7\n[2017: 173]). For non-believers, it involves accepting the continuing\npresence of religion in modern society, coming to view their\ndisagreements with believers as reasonable, accepting that believers\nhave a right to contribute to the public sphere in religious language,\nbeing willing to help translate those contributions into secular\nlanguage, and finally forgoing scientism, and scientistically\nmotivated atheism, in favour of political agnosticism (2005b chapter 4\n[2008a: 113]; 2005b chapter 8 [2008a: 263\u20134]; 2005b chapter 10\n[2008a: 309\u201310]; see also Baxter 2011: 205).\n\nTaken together, Habermas claims, these learning processes help to\nequalize the cognitive burdens borne by religious and non-religious\ncitizens. This model of postsecular deliberative democracy, Habermas\nargues, solves the problems of identity-splitting and de-legitimation\nwhich secularism inflicts on religious believers. Since they can now\ncontribute to the informal public sphere in religious language,\nbelievers no longer have to split their identities in two; since they\nknow that their religiously based contributions are making an impact\non the formal public sphere, they can see the laws which it produces\nas legitimate.\n\n\nEven if the religious language is the only one which they speak in\npublic, and if religiously justified opinions are the only ones they\ncan or wish to contribute to political controversies, they\nnevertheless understand themselves as members of a civitas\nterrena, which empowers them to be the authors of laws to which\nthey are subject as addressees. (2005b chapter 5 [2008a:\n130\u20131])\n\n\nHabermas\u2019s theory has come in for criticism from all sides. On\nthe one hand critics like Amy Allen claim that there is a residual\nasymmetry, and that Habermas still \u201cstacks the decks in favour\nof secularism\u201d (Allen 2013: 149). Wolterstorff agrees, though he\nthinks the problem lies with the idea of \u201cpost-metaphysical\nreason\u201d, while Allen traces it to his \u201cgenealogy of\npost-secular reason\u201d. Cristina Lafont argues, by contrast, that\nthe asymmetric burden falls the other way, since the cognitive\nlearning process imposes a duty on secular citizens to give up their\nscientistically motivated atheism in favour of politically motivated\nagnosticism (Lafont 2013: 238; Finlayson 2019: 14). The idea of\n\u201csacred-to-secular translation\u201d is central to\nHabermas\u2019s model of postsecular deliberative democracy. As an\nexample, Habermas cites German Christian groups translating the\nstatement from Genesis that \u201cGod created man in his own\nimage\u201d into secular language as \u201ca gamete fertilized\nex utero has the status of a subject of human rights\u201d\nas part of their arguments against stem-cell research (2001b chapter 2\n[2003b: 109]). Yet the idea has proved controversial. It is not clear,\nfor example, whether or not Habermas considers it to work the same way\nas ethical and philosophical appropriations of religious concepts (see\nCooke 2011; Kerkwijk 2015; Rees 2018: 143\u201365). For Wolterstorff\nit relies on the idea of post-metaphysical reason that is skewed in\nfavour of secularism, while Rees argues that the idea is empty, since\nno such translations are possible. ",
