    "main_text": "Problems of reduction || Ludwig\u2019s account\n4.3 Ludwig\u2019s account\n\nIn the writings of Ludwig there is no direct reference to the\nincommensurability thesis and the corresponding discussion. But\nobviously his approach implies the most radical denial of this thesis.\nHis reduction relation is composed of two simpler intertheoretic\nrelations called \u201crestriction\u201d and\n\u201cembedding\u201d. They come in two versions, exact and\napproximate. Part of their definitions are detailed rules of\ntranslation of the non-theoretic vocabulary of \\(T'\\) into that of\n\\(T\\). Hence commensurability, at least on the non-theoretical level,\nis insured by definition. The problem is then shifted to the task of\nshowing that some of the interesting cases of reduction, which are\ndiscussed in the context of incommensurability, fit into\nLudwig\u2019s definition. Unfortunately, he gives only one\nextensively worked-out example of reduction, namely thermodynamics vs.\nquantum statistical mechanics, in Ludwig (1987). Incommensurability of\ntheoretical terms could probably be more easily incorporated in\nLudwig\u2019s approach since it could be traced back to the\ndifference between the laws of \\(T\\) and \\(T'\\).\n",
