    "main_text": "Search For Life\n5. Search For Life\n\n\nEven the most pessimistic analyses of the likelihood of life\nsuggests life on Earth is not unique (Frank & Sullivan 2016). Many\nscientists take that as a good reason to search for life elsewhere in\nthe Universe. The current search for life elsewhere focuses on two\nextremes: the chemical byproducts of life and the technological signals\nof intelligent life. The social interactions of alien populations might\nbe interesting, but they are hard to study as of yet. Thus, we search\nfor biosignatures that might uniquely identify life from a great\ndistance. We\u2019ll take each in turn.\nBiosignatures, as the name implies, are purported to be markers of\nlife. Chemical biosignatures are compounds either rarely or never\nproduced without the assistance of life on Earth. Finding biosignatures\nthus implies a material conception of life, likely in the form of\nbiochemistry, metabolism, or thermodynamics. There have been many\nattempts to detect biosignatures, primarily on Mars. These approaches\ninclude experiments done on planetary surfaces, observations from Earth\nor low-earth orbit, and study of meteors and other debris from nearby\nplanetary bodies.\nMore practically, satellite or telescope observations of other\nplanets have been used to search for gasses outside of thermodynamic\nequilibrium. Methane has been sporadically detected on Mars since 2004\n(Formisano et al. 2004, Webster et al. 2018) with an accompanying claim\nof formaldehyde detection (Peplow 2005). Venus has also been a source\nof attention, with phosphine gas detected in the clouds above Venus\n(Greaves et al. 2020). A controversial finding, it nevertheless caught\nthe scientific imagination. Future scientific research is expected to\naccelerate this method of observation, especially with new data gathered by the new\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With its equipment, JWST is able to image exoplanets at  resolutions allowing the detection of gas biomarkers in the atmospheres of exoplanets (Loeb & Maoz 2013).\nBy contrast, there have been scarce attempts to detect\nchemical life while on the surface of another planet. In 1975, NASA\nsent the Viking landers to Mars, tasked with a variety of scientific\nexperiments including some that were purported to detect life if it was\npresent. One, the Labeled Release Experiment, did, but its results were\ninconsistent with the other on-board experiments, so the result was\ndeemed inconclusive (Levin & Straat 1976, Ezell & Ezell 1984).\nThe current Perseverence rover on Mars is able to assess\ncertain biosignatures and upcoming missions by NASA, the Chinese\nNational Space Administration, and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration\nAgency all seek to determine whether Mars has evidence of past or\ncurrent life.\nIt is not obvious that life on Mars would be a separate origin than\nlife on Earth, as the two planets exchange tons of rocks each year and\nit is at least theoretically possible that life could have formed on\none planet and been subsequently transferred to the other (McKay 2010).\nSince Mars is a smaller body than Earth, it coalesced before Earth and\nthus it is conceivable that life might have formed there first,\nalthough this is a relatively marginal view in the astrobiology\ncommunity. Meteorites from Mars and other planetary bodies have\nalso been the source of purported biosignatures. The Martian meteorite\nALH84001 was instrumental in forming the science of astrobiology in\n1996, after NASA scientists discovered bacteria-like structures (McKay\net al. 1996). Subsequent meteorites have also garnered scientific\ninterest (e.g. White et al. 2014).\nThe other major attempt to search for life, that of searching for\nintelligence, more readily captures the imagination. The search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has been ongoing for centuries\n(Dick  1982). Fierce debates between those that took Earth to be\nunique and those that took it to be one of a plurality of worlds\npersisted for millennia (and still do, to some extent). Advocates of\nthe plurality of worlds view searched their telescopes for evidence. A\nfamous instance is Percival Lowell\u2019s drawings of Martian canals\nin the 1890s. Influenced by the mid-1800s observations of what appeared\nto be channels criss-crossing Mars, Lowell drew a series of canals\nbased on his observations. Science fiction soon picked up the\nobservation and conjectured a dying civilization, hoping to squeeze\nwater out of the last bits of remaining ice in the Martian poles.\nPartially driven by the science fiction following Lowell\u2019s\ndrawings, the early 20th century saw increased interest in detecting\nradio signals from Outer Space. This interest accelerated after the\nlaunch of Sputnik in 1957 and was more systematically and formally\napproached starting in the late 1970s. SETI research has not been\npublicly funded since 1994, but private and public donors, as well as\nacademic and lay researchers have kept the program going since. There\nare many technical challenges to the search: space is unimaginably\nhuge, signals are weak, possibilities of interstellar communication are\nmyriad, and our searches can only cover an insignificant portion of the\ntask.\nMore controversially, many dozens of messages have been sent into\nOuter Space since 1974. A few have been in the form of physical objects\naboard spacecraft, but most have been radio signals aimed at promising\nstars or star clusters. sometimes called Active SETI or METI (Messaging\nExtraterrestrial Intelligence). Although the practice continues due to\nits low cost and relative ease, many philosophers, scientists, and\npolicy experts have come out against the practice largely due to the\nrisk of broadcasting our presence to potentially hostile forces on\nbehalf of future generations that cannot consent (Smith 2020).\n",
