He organised\na famous International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, held\nin London in 1965. Participants included Tarski, Quine, Carnap, Kuhn,\nand Popper. The Proceedings ran to four volumes (Lakatos (ed.) 1967\n& 1968, and Lakatos and Musgrave (eds.) 1968 & 1970). Lakatos\nhimself contributed three major papers to these proceedings. The first\nof these (Renaissance) has been dealt with already.\nThe second, \u201cChanges in the Problem of Inductive Logic\u201d\n(Changes), analyses the debate between Carnap and\nPopper regarding the relations between theory and evidence in science.\nIt is remarkable both for its conclusions and for its methodology. The\nconclusion, to put it bluntly, is that a certain brand of inductivism\nis bunk. The prospects for an inductive logic that allows you to\nderive scientific theories from sets of observation statements, thus\nproviding them with a weak or probabilistic justification, are dim\nindeed. There is no inductive logic according to which real-life\nscientific theories can be inferred, \u201cpartially proved\u201d or\n\u201cconfirmed (by facts) to a certain degree\u201d\u2019\n(Changes: 133). But Lakatos sought to prove his point\nby analysing the Popper/Carnap debate and reversing the common verdict\nthat Carnap had won and that Popper had lost. And here he faced a\nproblem. As Fox (1981) explains:\n\n\nThe facts on which the verdict was based were that Popper\u2019s\nclaimed refutations of Carnap all failed, through either fallacy or\nmisrepresentation, and that Carnap was a careful, precise, irenic\nthinker, in the habit of stating as his conclusions exactly what his\npremises warranted. The standards on which the verdict was based were\nthe respectable professional ones by which we mark third-year essays.\nThe verdict was: Carnap gets an A+, and Popper\u2019s refusal to\nwither away is a moral and intellectual embarrassment. (Fox 1981:\n94.)\n\n\nLakatos\u2019s strategy was to accept the facts but reverse the\nvalue-judgment by developing the twin concepts of a degenerating\nresearch programme and a degenerating problem-shift and\napplying them to Carnap\u2019s successive endeavours. But\nCarnap\u2019s programme was philosophico-mathematical rather than\nscientific. So what was wrong with it could not be that it failed to\npredict novel facts or that its predictions were mostly falsified. For\nit was not in the business of predicting empirical observations\nwhether novel or otherwise. (Indeed Lakatos\u2019s concept of a\ndegenerating philosophical programme seems to have preceded\nhis concept of a degenerating scientific programme.) So what\nwas wrong with Carnap\u2019s enterprise? In an effort to solve his\noriginal problem, Carnap had to solve a series of sub-problems. Some\nwere solved, others were not, generating sub-sub-problems of their\nown. Some of these were solved, others were not, generating\nsub-sub-sub-problems and sub-sub-sub-sub-problems etc. Since some of\nthese sub-problems (or sub-sub-problems) were solved, the programme\nappeared to its proponents be busy and progressive. But it was\ndrifting further and further away from achieving its original\nobjectives.\n\nNow for Lakatos, such problem-shifts are not necessarily degenerating.\nIf a programme ends up solving a problem that it did not set out to\nsolve, that is all fine and dandy so long as the problem that it\nsucceeds in solving is more interesting and important than the problem\nthat it did set out to solve.\n\n\nBut one may solve problems less interesting than the original one;\nindeed, in extreme cases, one may end up solving (or trying to solve)\nno other problems but those which one has oneself created while trying\nto solve the original problem. In such cases we may talk about a\ndegenerating problem-shift. (Changes:\n128\u20139.)\n\n\nThus Carnap starts off with the exciting problem of showing how\nscientific theories can be partially confirmed by empirical facts and\nends up with technical papers about drawing different coloured balls\nout of an urn. In Lakatos\u2019s opinion this does not constitute\nintellectual progress. Carnap had lost the plot.\n",
