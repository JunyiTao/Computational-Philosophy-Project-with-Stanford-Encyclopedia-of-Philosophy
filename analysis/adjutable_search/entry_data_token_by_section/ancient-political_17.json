    "main_text": "Hellenistic Philosophies and Politics || Epicureanism\n5.2 Epicureanism\n\nFounded by Epicurus in his \u201cGarden\u201d in Athens in the early\nthird century BCE, and elaborated by, among others, the remarkable\nLatin poet Lucretius in the mid first century BCE, the various members\nof the Epicurean school did not see politics as a straightforward part\nof the good life or a fulfillment of the flourishing of human nature,\nthough their views of its origins, nature, and largely instrumental\nvalue were complex (for an overview, see Robitzsch 2017). For his\npart, Epicurus himself (see the entry on\n Epicurus)\n is reported in his \u201cKey Doctrines\u201d to have held a\ncontractarian view of justice for mutual protection from harm\n(reminiscent of Glaucon\u2019s initial proposal about justice in\nRepublic Book II, which itself seems to echo the\nnomos-phusis debate among the 5th c. BCE sophists). Justice\nserves utility (Alberti 1995): as Epicurus wrote, \u201cIf someone\nmakes a law and it does not happen to accord with the utility of\nsocial relationships, it no longer has the nature of justice\u201d\n(KD 36, LS 22B) (on Epicurean justice, Aoiz and Boeri 2022).\nThe greatest utility is that of tranquility or security, which is the\nnaturally desired end or goal. While, as Annas 1993: 298 argues, the\nindividual Epicurean agent will be disposed to justice as part of the\npath to tranquility properly understood (\u201cThe just <life>\nis most free from disturbance\u2026\u201d, KD 36, LS 22B),\nnevertheless laws will be necessary to enforce obedience to the\ncontract by most people, and indeed one should obey the laws in order\nto attain peace of mind (KD 34\u201335, LS\n22A4\u20135).\n\nFor Epicureans, the city serves a legitimate and necessary function in\nensuring security. But this does not mean that an active public life\nis also normally the most rational path to security. On the contrary,\nwhile many people will be attracted to the possible fortune and glory\nof such a life, and while cities need such people, the Epicurean sage\nwill on the whole refrain from active political participation (for\ndiscussion of texts, including some exceptions, both in Lucretius and\nother evidence, see Fowler 2007). Instead the insecurities of life are\nbest met by the formation of a community of friends living together\nand sharing their lives. Friendships both secure us against risks and\nanxieties (more reliably than the hazards of a political career) and\nalso provide pleasures and indeed joy: to quote Epicurus once again,\n\u201cThe man of noble character is chiefly concerned with wisdom and\nfriendship. Of these the former is a mortal good, but the latter is\nimmortal\u201d (Vatican Sayings 78, LS 22F (7)).\n\nA potential sticking point for Epicurean ethics and politics is the\njustification for a still further dimension of communal life: the\nwillingness to sacrifice oneself for a friend, or to risk breaking the\nlaw for the greater good of one\u2019s fellow citizens (Sharples\n1996: 122). It would seem difficult to construct a compelling\ntheoretical justification for such actions from Epicurean premises,\nwhich privilege obedience to law in order to avoid civic strife (as\nseen for example in key moments in Lucretius\u2019 poem De Rerum\nNatura, V.925\u20131157; see Campbell 2003, especially on lines\n1011\u20131027), though Cicero has Torquatus report in De\nFinibus (I.69) that at least some Epicureans believed that\nfriendly relationships could mature into love of a friend for their\nown sake. Whatever the theoretical conundrum, it did not prevent a\nnumber of Epicureans from undertaking such risky public service, among\nthem more than one of the assassins of Julius Caesar (Sedley 1997;\nFowler 1989 discusses a wide range of Roman Epicurean attitudes). A\nmore modest but still striking example of Epicurean public service is\nthe huge portico inscribed with Epicurean sayings and exegesis in\nsecond-century Oenoanda (in modern-day Turkey) by one Diogenes of that\ncity (Smith 1992, 2003). Whether or not his fellow citizens\nappreciated the instruction, modern archaeologists and philosophers\nare grateful for this unparalleled source of knowledge of Epicurean\nphilosophy.\n",
