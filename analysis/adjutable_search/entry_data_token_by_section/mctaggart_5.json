    "main_text": "McTaggart\u2019s Metaphysical Pluralism\n6. McTaggart\u2019s Metaphysical Pluralism\n\n\nMcTaggart, unlike many of the idealists that were his contemporaries,\nwas a friend of the reality of relations and a kind of metaphysical\npluralist.\n\n\nMcTaggart\u2019s realism about relations seems to be a relatively\nmild realism: he believes in the existence of relations, and grants\nthat statements attributing relations to things might be true to the\nfullest degree, but it is not clear the extent to which he believed\nthat facts about the obtainings of relations were\nmetaphysically\n basic.[32]\nIt is true that the notion of perception, which is on the face of it a\nrelational notion, plays a fundamental role in his idealistic system.\nRecall that McTaggart held that reality consists of immaterial selves\nthat are unified by perceiving each other. What is not clear is whether\nMcTaggart believed that whenever some x perceives some\ny, it is virtue of the intrinsic qualities of x and\ny. (In one sense of the term \u201cintrinsic relation\u201d,\nperception would be an intrinsic relation if this claim were\ntrue.)\n\n\nMcTaggart believed that the most extreme kind of monism, namely the\ndoctrine that there is exactly one thing, is incoherent. For if there\nwere exactly one thing, it could have no attributes or features, and\nhence, on McTaggart\u2019s view, would really be\n nothing.[33]\nFor this\nreason, McTaggart held that we must not think of \u2018the absolute\nspirit\u2019 as an undifferentiated unity. In McTaggart\u2019s early\npaper, \u201cThe Further Determination of the Absolute\u201d,\nMcTaggart argues that if the absolute has features, then it must have\nparts standing in relations to one another.\n\nMcTaggart also rejected the less radical version of monism that holds\nthat there is only one substance. In first volume of the Nature of\nExistence, sections 65 and 73, McTaggart defined\n\u201csubstance\u201d as that which has features without being a\nfeature. In his later article, \u201can Ontological Idealism\u201d,\nhe defines \u201csubstance\u201d as that which has features without\nbeing a feature or having a feature as a part. The reason for the\nrevision is that at this point in McTaggart\u2019s career, he accepted\nthe existence of facts construed as complexes of particulars\nand properties. Facts satisfy the older definition of\n\u201csubstance\u201d but not the newer one. McTaggart argues\nthat we perceive that there are many substances, but also holds that it\nis a priori that, if there is one substance, then there are many, since\nit is a priori that every substance has infinitely many parts.\nMcTaggart also rejected solipsism understood as the view that\nreality consists of a single person, which although infinitely divided\nis such that nothing exists that is not a part of him. Solipsism thus\nunderstood is strictly compatible with the existence of a plurality of\nsubstances; however, McTaggart held that solipsism was ruled out by the\nrequirement that there be a relation of determining\n correspondence.[34]\n\n\nInterestingly, although McTaggart holds that some pantheistic\nphilosophers of the east held the view that there is exactly one\nsubstance, McTaggart denies that Spinoza held this view, and moreover\ndoes not attribute the view to his contemporaries, such as F.H.\nBradley. His pluralism consists in the fact that individual selves are\nthe fundamental units of being in his theory: from facts about the\nselves, all else follows. He is clearly a monist in the sense that he\nbelieved that all substances are immaterial substances.\n",
