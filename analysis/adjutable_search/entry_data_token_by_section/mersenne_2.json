    "main_text": "Metaphysical Issues || Metaphysics as Rational Theology\n3.1 Metaphysics as Rational Theology\n\nIn the Quaestiones, Mersenne offered a tripartition of the\ntheoretical sciences: metaphysics considers \u201ctrans-natural\nobjects, such as God and the angels, that are actually separated from\nall matter\u201d; doctrinal sciences\u2014that is\nmathematics\u2014deals with objects that are \u201cin truth\nmaterial, but considered abstracted from matter, such as the line and\nthe figure\u201d; natural sciences (physics) considers\n\u201cmaterial things as such, for example the heavens or the\nelements\u201d. (QG: col 92\u20133). In La\nV\u00e9rit\u00e9 (VS I: 50), Mersenne suggested that\nmetaphysics, although an abstract science, like logic and mathematics,\nis nevertheless closer to physics, in so far as their shared aim is to\nconsider \u201cthings as they are in themselves\u201d, and not\nsimply things as they appear to our senses\u2014in this both sciences\n\u201care rightly called sapience\u201d. He was later to revise this\ncoupling, suggesting in his Questions inou\u00efes (QI: 54)\nthat metaphysics is closer to mathematics, on account of the fact\nthat, contrary to physics, metaphysics and mathematics both consider\nimmutable and eternal objects, and are the only ones among the\nsciences capable of being really possessed by men here below.\n\nThe definition of metaphysics given in the Quaestiones is\nstrongly reminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics E1\u2014where\n\u201cprime philosophy\u201d is conceived as strictly concerned with\nthe separated or immaterial substances, thus with the\n\u201ctheological\u201d realm. Jean-Luc Marion (1994) pointed out\nthat although Mersenne, in several places, acknowledges formally\nanother traditional object for metaphysics, that is the \u201cens\nquatenus ens\u201d (the abstracted Being as such, whose science\napplies indifferently to all beings, created or uncreated), he seemed\nreluctant to give this science (that we now call ontology) any\nsubstance. In a striking passage from the Quaestiones,\nMersenne said that \u201cBeing\u201d is a name that suits God better\nthan any of the creatures:\n\n\nAmong all names \u201cbeing\u201d is the one that we should ascribe\nto God, rather than all the other ones naming the perfections of\ncreatures\u2026 God could justly say \u201cI am all Being, as I\ncontains all things more perfectly than they can contain\nthemselves\u201d. This is why all creatures could say \u201cmy name\nis non-Being, or non-entity\u201d (Non Esse, seu non Ens),\nas, according to Plato, truly all things except God have non-being\nrather than being. (QG: col. 21)\n\n\nIn later works the specificity of ontology was quickly dissolved into\nlogic on the one hand (an abstract science which shares with ontology\nthe same principle of non-contradiction, see VS 52\u201355) and into\nrational theology on the other hand, the science of immaterial beings\nand first causes. This dissolution may be seen as anticipating\nDescartes\u2019s own reduction of metaphysics to \u201cprime\nphilosophy\u201d, and, according to Marion, this is a very\nsignificant (albeit a merely negative one) legacy of Mersenne\u2019s\nwork to the history of metaphysics.\n",
