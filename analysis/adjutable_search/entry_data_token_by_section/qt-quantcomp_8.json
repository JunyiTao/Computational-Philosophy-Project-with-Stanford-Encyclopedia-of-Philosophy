    "main_text": "Basics || Adiabatic Algorithms\n3.2 Adiabatic Algorithms\n\nMany decades have passed since the discovery of the first quantum\nalgorithm, but so far little progress has been made with respect to\nthe \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of solving an\nNP-complete problem with a quantum-circuit. In 2000 a\ngroup of physicists from MIT and Northeastern University (Farhi et al.\n2000) proposed a novel paradigm for quantum computing that differs\nfrom the circuit model in several interesting ways. Their goal was to\ntry to solve with this algorithm an instance of the\nsatisfiability problem (see above), one of the most famous\nNP-complete problems (Cook 1971).\n\nAccording to the adiabatic theorem (e.g. Messiah 1961) and given\ncertain specific conditions, a quantum system remains in its lowest\nenergy state, known as the ground state, along an adiabatic\ntransformation in which the system is deformed slowly and smoothly\nfrom an initial Hamiltonian to a final Hamiltonian (as an\nillustration, think of moving a sleeping baby in a cradle from the\nliving room to the bedroom. If the transition is done slowly and\nsmoothly enough, and if the baby is a sound sleeper, then it will\nremain asleep during the whole transition). The most important\ncondition in this theorem is the energy gap between the ground state\nand the next excited state (in our analogy, this gap reflects how\nsound asleep the baby is). Being inversely proportional to the\nevolution time \\(T\\), this gap controls the latter. If this gap exists\nduring the entire evolution (i.e., there is no level crossing between\nthe energy states of the system), the theorem dictates that in the\nadiabatic limit (when \\(T\\rightarrow \\infty)\\) the system will remain\nin its ground state. In practice, of course, \\(T\\) is always finite,\nbut the longer it is, the less likely it is that the system will\ndeviate from its ground state during the time evolution.\n\nThe crux of the quantum adiabatic algorithm which rests on this\ntheorem lies in the possibility of encoding a specific instance of a\ngiven decision problem in a certain Hamiltonian (this can be done by\ncapitalising on the well-known fact that any decision problem can be\nderived from an optimisation problem by incorporating into it a\nnumerical bound as an additional parameter). One then starts the\nsystem in a ground state of another Hamiltonian which is easy to\nconstruct, and slowly evolves the system in time, deforming it towards\nthe desired Hamiltonian. According to the quantum adiabatic theorem\nand given the gap condition, the result of such a physical process is\nanother energy ground state that encodes the solution to the desired\ndecision problem. The adiabatic algorithm is thus a rather \u2018laid\nback\u2019 algorithm: one needs only to start the system in its\nground state, deform it adiabatically, and measure its final ground\nstate in order to retrieve the desired result. But whether or not this\nalgorithm yields the desired \u201cspeed-up\u201d depends crucially\non the behaviour of the energy gap as the number of degrees of freedom\nin the system increases. If this gap decreases exponentially with the\nsize of the input, then the evolution time of the algorithm will\nincrease exponentially; if the gap decreases polynomially, the\ndecision problem so encoded could be solved efficiently in polynomial\ntime. Although physicists have been studying spectral gaps for almost\na century, they have never done so with quantum computing in mind. How\nthis gap behaves in general remains thus far an open\nempirical question.\n\nThe quantum adiabatic algorithm holds much promise (Farhi et al.\n2001). It has been shown (Aharonov et al. 2008) to be polynomially\nequivalent to the circuit model (that is, each model can simulate the\nother with only polynomial overhead in the number of qubits and\ncomputational steps), but the caveat that is sometimes left\nunmentioned is that its application to an intractable computational\nproblem may sometimes require solving another, as intractable a task\n(this general worry was first raised by a philosopher; see Pitowsky\n(1990)). Indeed, Reichardt (2004) has shown that there are simple\nproblems for which the algorithm will get stuck in a local minimum, in\nwhich there are exponentially many eigenvalues all exponentially close\nto the ground state energy, so applying the adiabatic theorem, even\nfor these simple problems, will take exponential time, and we are back\nto square one.\n",
