    "main_text": "The Arguments for the Principles of Justice from the Original Position\n6. The Arguments for the Principles of Justice from the Original Position\n\nThe original position is not a bargaining situation where the parties\nmake proposals and counterproposals and negotiate over different\nprinciples of justice. Nor is it a wide ranging discussion where the\nparties debate, deliberate, and design their own conception of justice\n(unlike, for example, Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics; see Habermas,\n1995). Instead, the parties\u2019 deliberations are much more\nconstrained and regulated. They are presented with a list of\nconceptions of justice taken from the tradition of western political\nphilosophy. These include different versions of utilitarianism,\nperfectionism, and intuitionism (or pluralist views), rational egoism,\njustice as fairness, and a group of \u201cmixed conceptions\u201d\nthat combine elements of these. (For Rawls\u2019s initial list see TJ\n124/107) Rawls later says libertarian entitlement principles should\nalso be added to the list, and contends the principles of justice are\nstill preferable. (JF 83). (Nozick agrees and says the OP is incapable\nof yielding historical entitlement principles, but only patterned\nend-state principles instead. Nozick 1974, 198\u2013204. Rawls\nreplies that the difference principle does not conform to any\nobservable pattern but grounds fair distributions in a fair social\nprocess that must actually be carried out. PL, 282\u201383)\n\nThe parties\u2019 deliberations are confined to discussing and\nagreeing upon the conception that each finds most rational, given\ntheir specified interests. In a series of pairwise comparisons, they\nconsider all the conceptions of justice made available to them and\nultimately agree unanimously to accept the conception that survives\nthis winnowing process. In this regard, the original position is best\nseen as a kind of selection process wherein the parties\u2019\ndeliberations are constrained by the background conditions imposed by\nthe original position as well as the list of conceptions of justice\nprovided to them. They are assigned the task of agreeing on principles\nfor designing the basic structure of a self-contained society under\nthe circumstances of justice.\n\nIn making their decision, the parties are motivated only by their own\nrational interests. They do not take moral considerations of justice\ninto account except in so far as these considerations bear on their\nachieving their interests within society. Their interests again are\ndefined in terms of their each acquiring an adequate share of primary\nsocial goods (rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income\nand wealth, etc.) and achieving the background social conditions\nenabling them to effectively pursue their conception of the good and\nrealize their higher-order interests in developing and exercising\ntheir moral powers. Since the parties are ignorant of their particular\nconceptions of the good and of all other particular facts about their\nsociety, they are not in a position to engage in bargaining. In effect\nthey all have the same general information and are motivated by the\nsame interests.\n\nRawls makes four arguments in Theory, Part I for the\nprinciples of justice. The main argument for the difference principle\nis made later in TJ \u00a749, and is amended and clarified in\nJustice as Fairness: A Restatement. The common theme\nthroughout the original position arguments is that it is more rational\nfor the parties to choose the principles of justice over any other\nalternative. Rawls devotes most of his attention to the comparison of\njustice as fairness with classical and average utilitarianism, with\nbriefer discussions of perfectionism (TJ, \u00a750) and intuitionism\n(TJ 278\u201381) Here I\u2019ll focus discussion primarily on\nRawls\u2019s comparison between justice as fairness and\nutilitarianism.\n",
