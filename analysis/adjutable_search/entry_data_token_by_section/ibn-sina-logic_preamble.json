    "main_text": "\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 [hereafter: Avicenna] (980\u20131037 CE) is\u2014directly\nor indirectly\u2014the most influential logician in the Arabic\ntradition. His work is central in the re-definition of a family of\nproblems and doctrines inherited from ancient and late ancient logic,\nespecially Aristotle and the Peripatetic tradition. While, in general\nterms, Avicenna squarely falls into a logical tradition that it is\nreasonable to characterize as Aristotelian, the trove of innovations\nhe introduces establishes him as a genuinely new canonical figure. Every\nlater logician in this tradition confronts him, either as a critic or\nas a follower, to the extent that, with few exceptions, Aristotle and\nthe Peripatetic tradition almost entirely disappear from the\nscene. Arabic logic accordingly divides into two areas and periods:\npre-Avicennan and post-Avicennan (Street\n2004).[1]\n\nThe innovations introduced by Avicenna include systematic as well as\ntechnical points: from the division of logic into its main areas to\nthe reading of propositions and the understanding of modality; from a\nnew account of hypothetical propositions to his theory of\ndemonstration.\n\nThis entry aims to offer an account of some of the most representative\nfeatures of Avicenna\u2019s logic without any pretense to\nexhaustiveness. A standard classification of the works and contents of\nthe Aristotelian Organon in the Arabic tradition (which\nincludes Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge, alongside\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric and Poetics) divides\nthe study of logic broadly into two main areas focusing either on (i)\nformal aspects (e.g., the analysis of the truth conditions of\npropositions, inference, and the structure of arguments) or (ii) on\nmaterial aspects (e.g., the classification of arguments with\nrespect to their terms and premises, which underwrites a standard\ndivision of logic into five areas: demonstration, dialectic,\nsophistic, rhetoric, and poetics). The entry focuses primarily on (i)\nand limits the treatment of (ii) to the case of demonstration and\nfallacies.\n",
