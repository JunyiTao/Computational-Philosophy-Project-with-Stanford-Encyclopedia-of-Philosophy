    "main_text": "Maxwell, Szilard and Landauer || Landauer's principle\n1.3 Landauer's principle\n\n\nLandauer (1961) investigated the question of what are the physical\nlimitations on building a device to implement a computation. At the\ntime he wrote, an influential body of work had been developed, by\nBrillouin (1951, 1956), Gabor (1964) and Rothstein (1951), arguing\nthat the acquisition of information through a measurement required a\ndissipation of at least\nkT\u2009\u2009ln\u20092\nenergy for each bit of information gathered. von Neumann (1949) had\nalso suggested on the basis of Szilard's work, that every act of\ninformation processing was necessarily accompanied by this level of\nenergy dissipation.\n\n\nStarting by representing logical operations as abstract maps defined\nfrom one set of discrete logical states to another set, Landauer argued\nthat a physical system that was designed to implement the logical\noperation must have physical states to correspond to the logical\nstates. He then distinguished between logically reversible and\nlogically irreversible operations: an operation is logically reversible\nif the input state can be uniquely identified from the output\nstate.\n\n\nThe NOT operation, for example, is a logically reversible operation.\nIf the output is logical state one, then the input must have been\nlogical state zero, and vice versa. An example of a logically\nirreversible operation is the AND operation. If the output is logical\nstate zero, then there are three possible combinations of input logical\nstates that could have produced that output: (zero, zero); (zero, one);\nand (one, zero).\n\n\nAs logically reversible operations need to be 1:1 maps, Landauer\nargued they can be implemented by physical devices which do not\ncompress the physical state space. Logically irreversible operations\nreduce the logical state space, so must compress the physical state\nspace. Landauer argued that this must be accompanied by a corresponding\nentropy increase in the environment, in the form of heat dissipation.\nMost familiar logical operations are irreversible and so by this\nargument must generate heat.\n\n\n\n\nTo quantify the heat generation Landauer considered the most basic\nlogically irreversible operation to be resetting a bit. This operation\ntakes two input logical states, (conventionally zero and one) and\nalways outputs logical state zero (in some papers reset to one is\nconsidered instead).\n\n\nFor a physical implementation of this operation, it is usual to\nconsider a device similar to the Szilard engine. A box, in thermal\ncontact with a heat bath, contains a single molecule and a partition\nwhich divides the box in two. If the molecule is on the left hand side,\nthen the physical state represents logical state zero and if the\nmolecule is on the right hand side, it represents logical state\none.\n\n\nThe partition is then removed from the centre of the box, so the\nmolecule is free to travel throughout the box. The partition is\ninserted into the far right hand side of the box and, maintaining\nthermal contact, is slowly moved to the centre of the box. Once again,\ncollisions with the molecule exert a pressure on the partition,\nrequiring work to be performed, and the energy from the work is\ntransferred via the molecule to heat in the heat bath. Standard\ncalculations show this requires at least\nkT\u2009\u2009ln\u20092 work. One expression\nof what has now become known as \u201cLandauer's principle\u201d is\nthat there are no possible physical implementations of the resetting\noperation that can do better that this, that is, reset a bit to zero\nconverting less than\nkT\u2009\u2009ln\u20092\nof work into heat.\n\n\nLandauer referred to this operation as resetting, although in much of\nthe succeeding literature this has become known as erasure. This has\ncaused some confusion as \u201cerasing\u201d information could be\ntaken just to mean an operation which destroys the original\ninformation, without necessarily leaving the system determinately in\nthe zero state. An example of such\n\u2018erasure-by-destruction\u2019 would be to simply remove the\npartition from the box, wait long enough for thermalisation to\nrandomise the location of the molecule, then reinsert the partition in\nthe centre of the box.  Such an operation would clearly destroy the\noriginal information, represented by the original location of the\nmolecule, but requires no work to be performed. However, it is also\nclearly not an implementation of the reset operation.\n\n\nLandauer's argument suggests that, purely from the abstract properties\nof a logical operation one can deduce a thermodynamic constraint upon\nany physical system which is required to act as an embodiment of that\nlogical operation. It suggests there is a non-trivial thermodynamics\nof computation, a non-trivial connection between abstract logical\nfunctions and their physical implementation in thermal systems.\n\n\nLandauer did not, in his 1961 paper, directly address the question\nof whether a measurement was logically reversible or irreversible, but\nonly questioned whether the concept of a measurement had been defined\nsufficiently well in the work of Brillouin and others. At that point in\ntime, he regarded logical irreversibility as an essential part of\ncomputation and believed this was responsible for a necessary minimum\nheat generation in information processing. His arguments were presented\nas making more precise the arguments of Brillouin and von Neumann.\n\n\nBennett (1973) built upon Landauer's work, but argued that logical\nirreversibility could be avoided in computation in general. In\n(Bennett 1982) he argued that measurement could also be represented by\na logically reversible process, avoiding any need to generate\nheat. This represented a major change from von Neumann and Brillouin's\narguments, and Bennett's presentation of Landauer's principle rapidly\nbecame accepted as the fundamental principle of the thermodynamics of\ncomputation.\n",
