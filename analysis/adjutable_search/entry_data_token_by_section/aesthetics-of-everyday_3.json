    "main_text": "Negative Aesthetics\n4. Negative Aesthetics\n\nThis account of everyday life as pervaded by negative aesthetic\nqualities rather than lacking any aesthetic qualities gives rise to\n\u2018negative aesthetics.\u2019 This notion may at first appear to\nbe an oxymoron, if \u2018aesthetics\u2019 is understood in the usual\nhonorific sense. Katya Mandoki and Arnold Berleant stress the\nimportance of attending to this aesthetically negative aspect of\npeople\u2019s lives that is unfortunately all too common (Mandoki\n2007; Berleant 2010, 2012). Negative aesthetic qualities such as\nugliness, grotesqueness, repulsiveness, and disgust have not been\nabsent in the prevailing aesthetics discourse, but they don\u2019t\noccupy a prominent place (notable exceptions being Korsmeyer 2011,\nForsey 2016). Furthermore, more often than not, these negative\nqualities become justified as a necessary means to facilitating an\nultimately positive aesthetic experience. For example, a disgusting\ncontent of art may be necessary for conveying an overall message, such\nas an expos\u00e9 and critique of social ills, or a repulsive sight\nin nature, such as a predator devouring its prey, can be appreciated\nas an integral part of nature\u2019s process.\n\nNegative aesthetic qualities experienced as negative, in comparison,\nare unfortunately quite pervasive in everyday life and they directly\naffect the quality of life. They range from less noteworthy qualities\nsuch as the boring, the monotonous, the uninspiring, the banal, and\nthe dull to \u201caesthetic violence,\u201d \u201caesthetic\npain,\u201d \u201caesthetic poisoning,\u201d or \u201caesthetic\nassault,\u201d such as the hideous, the offensive, the repulsive, and\nthe vulgar (Mandoki 2007). These more dramatically negative qualities\ncan be experienced in a squalid urban space, deafening noise,\ncluttered billboard with gaudy signage and sordid visual images,\nstench from a nearby factory, and the like. In light of the fact that\naesthetics has tended to confine its scope to positive qualities and\nexperiences, everyday aesthetics challenges us to pay serious\nattention to the aesthetically negative aspects of our lives because\nof their immediate impact on the quality of life.\n\nThe focus on negative aesthetics is particularly important in everyday\naesthetics discourse because it leads to what may be regarded as its\nactivist dimension. When confronted with negative aesthetic qualities,\nwe generally don\u2019t remain a mere spectator but rather spring\ninto action to eliminate, reduce, or transform them. Even if we\ndon\u2019t or can\u2019t act, we wish we could do so and we think we\nshould. According to the prevailing mode of aesthetic analysis\nregarding art, and to a certain extent nature, our aesthetic life is\nprimarily characterized from a spectator\u2019s point of view. We are\nnot literally engaged in an activity with the object other than\naesthetic engagement. Even if we are inspired to act by art or nature,\nthe resultant action is generally indirect, such as joining a\npolitical movement or making a contribution to an organization.\n\nIn comparison, the action we undertake motivated by negative\naesthetics in daily life has a direct impact on life. On a personal\nlevel, we launder a stained shirt and iron it, clean the carpet soiled\nby spilled wine, repaint the living room wall, open a window to get\nfresh air after cooking fish indoors, tidy up the guest room, reformat\na document for a clearer look, and the list goes on (Forsey 2016;\nSaito 2017a). These actions are taken primarily in response to our\nnegative aesthetic reaction against stain, wrinkle, unpleasant color\nof the wall, fishy smell, mess and clutter, and disorganized look. On\na community level, eyesore-like abandoned structures get torn down or\ngiven a make-over, a squalid neighborhood gets cleaned up, and\nordinances are created to eliminate factory stench and cluttered\nbillboards. At least we often work, or believe we should work, toward\nimproving the aesthetics of everyday environment and life. Negative\naesthetic experiences are thus useful and necessary in detecting what\nis harmful to the quality of life and environment and provide an\nimpetus for improvement (Berleant 2012).\n",
