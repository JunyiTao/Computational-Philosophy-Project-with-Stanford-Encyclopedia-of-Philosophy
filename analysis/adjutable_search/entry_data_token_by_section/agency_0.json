    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\nIn a very broad sense, agency is virtually everywhere. Whenever\nentities enter into causal relationships, they can be said to act on\neach other and interact with each other, bringing about changes in\neach other. In this very broad sense, it is possible to identify\nagents and agency, and patients and patiency, virtually \neverywhere.[1]\nUsually, though, the term \u2018agency\u2019 is used in a much narrower sense to denote the performance of intentional actions. This\nway of thinking about agency has a long history in philosophy and it\ncan be traced back to Hume and Aristotle, among other historical\nfigures. In contemporary analytic philosophy, it is most commonly\nassociated with the influential work of Anscombe (1957) and Davidson\n(1963). Anscombe\u2019s and Davidson\u2019s views differ\nsignificantly in many respects, but they share the central doctrine\nthat action is to be explained in terms of the intentionality of intentional action. In the debates that followed, the philosophy of\naction revolved largely around the notion of intentional action. For\nsome time, the term \u2018agency\u2019 was rarely used, and if it was, it was usually taken to refer to the exercise of the capacity to perform intentional actions.[2] This has changed in the more recent\ndebate, where talk about agency has become more and more common in\nmany areas of philosophy (and in other areas of\nresearch).[3] To\nsome extent, this focus on the notion of agency has been fuelled by a\nresistance to the assimilation of agency to intentional action. As we\nwill see in the following section, this resistance amounts in some\ncases to the rejection of the standard conception of action,\nin some cases it amounts to the rejection of the\nstandard theory of action, and in some it amounts to the\nmore modest claim that there are different kinds of\nagency.\n",
