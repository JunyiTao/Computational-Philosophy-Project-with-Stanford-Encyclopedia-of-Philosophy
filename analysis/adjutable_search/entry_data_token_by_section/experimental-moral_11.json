It is important to distinguish here\nbetween \u2018good life\u2019 in the sense of a life that goes well\nfor the one who lives it, and a morally good life, since\nphilosophers have long debated whether a morally bad person could\nenjoy a good life. The empirical study of wellbeing focuses primarily\non lives that are good in the former sense: good for the person whose\nlife it is. Second, we need to distinguish between a hedonically good\nlife and an overall good life. A life that is hedonically good is one\nthat the subject experiences as pleasant; an overall good life might\nnot contain much pleasure but might be good for other reasons, such as\nwhat it accomplishes. We might decide, after investigation, that an\noverall good life must be a hedonically good life, but the two\nconcepts are distinct.\n\nWith these distinctions in mind, we can see the relevance of\nexperimental evidence to investigations in this area. First and\nperhaps most obviously, experiments can investigate our intuitions\nabout what constitutes a good life, thereby giving us insight into the\nordinary concepts of happiness, well-being, and flourishing. To this\nend, Phillips, Nyholm, and Liao (2014) investigated intuitions about\nthe relationship between morality and happiness. Their results suggest\nthat the ordinary conception of happiness involves both descriptive\nand normative components: specifically, we judge that people are happy\nif they are experiencing positive feelings that they ought to\nexperience. So, to use their examples, a Nazi doctor who gets positive\nfeelings from conducting his experiments is not happy. By contrast, a\nnurse who gets positive feelings from helping sick children is happy,\nthough a nurse who is made miserable by the same actions is not\nhappy.\n\nAnother set of experimental findings bearing on this question involves\nNozick\u2019s (1974: 44\u201345) experience machine thought\nexperiment. In response to the hedonist\u2019s claim that pleasure is\nthe only intrinsic good, Nozick asks us to consider the following:\n\nSuppose there was an experience machine that would give you any\nexperience you desired. Super-duper neuropsychologists could stimulate\nyour brain so that you would think and feel you were writing a great\nnovel, or making a friend, or reading an interesting book. All the\ntime you would be floating in a tank, with electrodes attached to your\nbrain. Should you plug into this machine for life, preprogramming your\nlife experiences? [\u2026] Of course, while in the tank you\nwon\u2019t know that you\u2019re there; you\u2019ll think that\nit\u2019s all actually happening [\u2026] Would you plug in?\n\n\nNozick argues that our response to the experience machine reveals that\nwell-being is not purely subjective: \u201cWe learn that something\nmatters to us in addition to experience by imagining an experience\nmachine and then realizing that we would not use it.\u201d De Brigard\n(2010) reports finding that subjects\u2019 intuitions about the\nexperience were different if they were told they were already in such\na machine, in which case they would not choose to unplug; he explains\nthis in terms of the status quo bias. Weijers (2014) goes further,\nasking subjects about Nozick\u2019s original scenario while also\nasking them to justify their response; he found that many of the\njustifications implied a kind of imaginative resistance to the\nscenario or cited irrelevant factors. He also found that respondents\nwere more likely to say that a \u2018plugged in life\u2019 would be\nbetter when they were choosing for someone else, rather than for\nthemselves. L\u00f6hr (2019) shows that a third of philosophers would\nstay in the machine and recommend it to others. Hindriks and Douven\n(2018) further show that people are more likely to agree to choose\npleasurable, but illusory experiences in scenarios that are more\nrealistic than the experience machine.   \n\nA second type of study involves investigating the causes and\ncorrelates of happiness, well-being, and life-satisfaction. These\nexperiments look at the conditions under which people report positive\naffect or life-satisfaction, as well as the conditions under which\nthey judge that their lives are going well. This is distinct from the\nfirst type of research, since the fact that someone reports an\nexperience as being pleasurable does not necessarily tell us whether\nthey would judge that experience to be pleasurable for someone else;\nthere may be asymmetries in first- and third-person evaluations.\nFurthermore, this type of research can tell us how various candidates\ncontribute to well-being from a first-person perspective, but that\ndoesn\u2019t settle the question of the concept of a good life. I\nmight judge that my life is going well, yet fail to notice that I am\ndoing so because I am in a very good mood, and that in fact I am not\naccomplishing any of my goals; if confronted with another person in a\nsimilar situation, I might not make the same judgment. Which of these\njudgments best represents our concept of well-being is a tricky\nquestion, and a normative one since experimental evidence alone may\nnot settle it. As it turns out, experiments have uncovered a number of\nfactors that influence our own reports and assessments of pleasure and\nwell-being. We will discuss two areas of research in particular:\nreports of pleasures and pains, and judgments of life\nsatisfaction.\n\nFirst, in the realm of hedonic evaluation, there are marked\ndivergences between the aggregate sums of in-the-moment pleasures and\npains and ex post memories of pleasures and pains. For example, the\nremembered level of pain of a colonoscopy is well-predicted by the\naverage of the worst momentary level of pain and the final level of\npain; furthermore, the duration of the procedure has no measurable\neffect on ex post pain ratings (Redelmeier & Kahneman 1996). What\nthis means is that people\u2019s after-the-fact summaries of their\nhedonic experiences are not simple integrals with respect to time of\nmomentary hedonic tone. If the colonoscopy were functionally completed\nafter minute 5, but arbitrarily prolonged for another 5 minutes so\nthat the final level of pain was less at the end of minute 10 than at\nthe end of minute 5, the patient would retrospectively evaluate the\nexperience as less painful. This complicates accounts of well-being in\nterms of pleasure (for example, Bentham\u2019s 1789/1961 hedonism)\ninsofar as it raises the question whether the pleasure being measured\nis pleasure as experienced in the moment, or retrospectively: if, in\nthe very act of aggregating pleasure, we change the way we evaluate\nit, this is a complication for hedonism and for some versions of\nutilitarianism. Since well-being is supposed to be a normative notion\ncapable of guiding both individual actions and social policy, findings\nlike these also call into question what, exactly, we ought to be\nseeking to maximize: pleasurable moments, or the overall retrospective\nevaluation of pleasure.\n\nSuch findings have led some philosophers to seek out alternatives to\nhedonism in hopes of establishing a more empirically stable\nunderpinning for well-being: in particular, the idea that well-being\nconsists in life satisfaction. The most prominent psychologist in this\nfield is Ed\n Diener[11]\n whose Satisfaction with Life Scale asks participants to agree or\ndisagree with statements such as, \u201cI am satisfied with my\nlife\u201d and \u201cIf I could live my life over, I would change\nalmost nothing.\u201d These questions seem to get at more stable and\nsignificant features of life than hedonic assessments in terms of\npleasure and pain, and one might expect the responses to be more\nconsistent and robust. However, two problems arise. The first is that\nparticipants\u2019 responses to life satisfaction questionnaires may\nnot be accurate reports of standing attitudes. Fox and Kahneman\n(1992), for instance, showed that, especially in personal domains\npeople seem to value (friends and love life), what predicts\nparticipants\u2019 responses is not recent intrapersonal factors but\nsocial comparison. Someone who has just lost a friend but still thinks\nof herself as having more friends than her peers will tend to report\nhigher life satisfaction than someone who has just gained a friend but\nwho still thinks of himself as having fewer friends than his\npeers.\n\nLife satisfaction surveys were also believed to be subject to\norder effects. If a participant is asked a global life satisfaction\nquestion and then asked about his romantic life, the correlation\nbetween these questions tends to be near zero, but if the participant\nis asked the dating question first, the correlation tends to be high\nand positive (Strack, Martin & Schwarz\n1988). Relatedly, weather and life-satisfaction were\ncorrelated when subjects were asked about weather first, but not when\nthe weather question followed the life-satisfaction query (Schwarz\n& Clore 1983). Recent work has however cast doubts on this\nkind of results: Schimmack and Oishi (2005) did not\nreplicate Strack et al.\u2019s (1988) findings and Lucas and Lawless\n(2013) found no evidence for an effect of weather on\nlife-satisfaction judgments (but see Connolly\n 2013).[12]\n Recent surveys suggest that the instability of life satisfaction\nsurveys, which some philosophers have been taken for granted, has been\nexaggerated (Lucas 2018). \n\nSchwarz\u2019s findings and similar ones have led some philosophers (e.g.,\nHaybron 2008) to argue that life-satisfaction judgments are too\narbitrary to ever satisfy the requirements of a theory of well-being.\nIn response, Tiberius and Plakias (2011) argue for an idealized\nlife-satisfaction theory they call value-based life\nsatisfaction, suggesting that by asking subjects to consider\ntheir life-satisfaction while attending to the domains they most value\nmuch of the instability plaguing the studies described above is\nremoved, a claim they support with research showing that judgments\nmade after priming subjects to think about their values demonstrate\nhigher levels of retest stability (Schimmack & Oishi 2005).\n",
