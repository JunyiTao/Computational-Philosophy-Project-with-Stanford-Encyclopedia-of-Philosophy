    "main_text": "\n\n\nAb\u016b-\u02bfAl\u012b al-\u1e24usayn ibn-\u02bfAbdall\u0101h\nIbn-S\u012bn\u0101 [Avicenna] (ca. 970\u20131037) was the preeminent\nphilosopher and physician of the Islamic\n world.[1]\nIn his work he combined the disparate strands of \n philosophical/scientific[2] \n thinking in Greek late antiquity and early\nIslam into a rationally rigorous and self-consistent scientific system\nthat encompassed and explained all reality, including the tenets of\nrevealed religion and its theological and mystical elaborations. In\nits integral and comprehensive articulation of science and philosophy,\nit represents the culmination of the Hellenic tradition, defunct in\nGreek after the sixth century, reborn in Arabic in the 9th\n(Gutas 2004a, 2010). It dominated intellectual life in the Islamic\nworld for centuries to come, and the sundry reactions to it, ranging\nfrom acceptance to revision to refutation and to substitution with\nparaphilosophical constructs, determined developments in philosophy,\nscience, religion, theology, and mysticism. In Latin translation,\nbeginning with the 12th century, Avicenna\u2019s\nphilosophy influenced mightily the medieval and Renaissance\nphilosophers and scholars, just as the Latin translation of his\nmedical Canon (GMed 1), often revised, formed the basis of\nmedical instruction in European universities until the 17th\ncentury. The Arabophone Jewish and Christian scholars within Islam, to\nthe extent that they were writing for their respective communities and\nnot as members of the Islamic commonwealth, accepted most of his ideas\n(notably Maimonides in his Arabic Guide of the Perplexed and\nBarhebraeus in his Syriac Cream of Wisdom). The Jewish\ncommunities in Europe used Hebrew translations of some of his works,\nthough they were far less receptive than their Roman Catholic\ncounterparts, preferring Averroes instead. The Roman Orthodox in\nConstantinople were quite indifferent to philosophical developments\nabroad (and inimical to those at home) and came to know\nAvicenna\u2019s name only through its occurrence in the Greek\ntranslations of the Latin scholastics that began after the\n4th Crusade. In his influence on the intellectual history\nof the world in the West (of India), he is second only to Aristotle,\nas it was intuitively acknowledged in the Islamic world where he is\ncalled \u201cThe Preeminent Master\u201d (al-shaykh\nal-ra\u02be\u012bs), after Aristotle, whom Avicenna called\n\u201cThe First Teacher\u201d (al-mu\u02bfallim al-awwal).\n\n",
