(Deutsch 1985)\n\n\nSince no machine operating by finite means can simulate classical\nphysics\u2019 continuity of states and dynamics, Deutsch argues that\nDP is false in a classical world. He argues that it is true for\nquantum physics, however, owing to the existence of the universal\nquantum Turing machine he introduces in the same paper, which thus\nproves both DP and the Church-Turing thesis it underlies to be sound.\nThis idea\u2014that the Church-Turing thesis requires a physical\ngrounding\u2014is set into historical context by Lupacchini (2018),\nwho traces its roots in the thought of G\u00f6del, Post, and Gandy. It\nis criticised by Timpson (2013), who views it as methodologically\nfruitful, but as nevertheless resting on a confusion regarding the\nmeaning of the Church-Turing thesis, which in itself has nothing to do\nwith physics.\n",
