    "main_text": "\n\nAristotle conceives of ethical theory as a field distinct from the\ntheoretical sciences. Its methodology must match its subject\nmatter\u2014good action\u2014and must respect the fact that in this\nfield many generalizations hold only for the most part. We study\nethics in order to improve our lives, and therefore its principal\nconcern is the nature of human well-being. Aristotle follows Socrates\nand Plato in taking the virtues to be central to a well-lived life.\nLike Plato, he regards the ethical virtues (justice, courage,\ntemperance and so on) as complex rational, emotional and social\nskills. But he rejects Plato\u2019s idea that to be completely\nvirtuous one must acquire, through a training in the sciences,\nmathematics, and philosophy, an understanding of what goodness is.\nWhat we need, in order to live well, is a proper appreciation of the\nway in which such goods as friendship, pleasure, virtue, honor and\nwealth fit together as a whole. In order to apply that general\nunderstanding to particular cases, we must acquire, through proper\nupbringing and habits, the ability to see, on each occasion, which\ncourse of action is best supported by reasons. Therefore practical\nwisdom, as he conceives it, cannot be acquired solely by learning\ngeneral rules. We must also acquire, through practice, those\ndeliberative, emotional, and social skills that enable us to put our\ngeneral understanding of well-being into practice in ways that are\nsuitable to each occasion.\n",
