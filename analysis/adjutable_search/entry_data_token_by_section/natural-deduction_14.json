IntElim and some Possible Philosophical Consequences\n\nCertain features of natural deduction have been thought to be of a\nmore general philosophical interest than just to the realm of\norganizing and displaying derivations of logical systems in an\nefficient and perspicuous form. Here we discuss two areas where the\nidea of Introduction and Elimination rules for each connective\nreverberates into philosophical debate of other topics.\n",
