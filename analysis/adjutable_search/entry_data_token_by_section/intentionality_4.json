    "main_text": "True negative existential beliefs\n5. True negative existential beliefs\n\nWhen Brentano reflected on the \u201cquasi-relational\u201d nature\nof the intentionality of thoughts about things that need not\nexist, he wrote that if one \u201cis denying something, the existence\nof the object is precisely what is excluded whenever [one\u2019s]\ndenial is correct\u201d. He thus assumed that one can correctly and\ncoherently deny the existence of things that do not exist. To show\nthat one can do so, however, is no easy task. The version of the\npuzzle that exercised both Alexius Meinong (a disciple of\nBrentano\u2019s) and Bertrand Russell at the turn of the twentieth\ncentury is the puzzle of true negative existential beliefs. How can a\nperson correctly believe that Pegasus does not exist? For a person to\ncorrectly believe that Pegasus does not exist, she must have a belief\nwhose content is the same as the content expressed by a true utterance\nof sentence (7).\n\n Pegasus does not exist.\n\n\nHow can the proposition expressed by an utterance of (7) be both true\nand about Pegasus? The puzzle arises from the observation that if the\nproposition is true, then presumably it is not about Pegasus since it\nsays that Pegasus does not exist. Conversely, if it is about Pegasus,\nthen Pegasus must exist. But if so, then it cannot be true since it\ndenies the existence of Pegasus. Thus, the puzzle has the form of a\ndilemma: either the proposition expressed by (7) is false or it is not\nabout Pegasus. At least, the puzzle is generated by the pair of\nassumptions that \u2018Pegasus\u2019 is a proper name and that\nproper names must have a reference. Is the first assumption\nright?\n\nIn his 1905 paper, \u201cOn denoting,\u201d Russell embraced the\nview that neither \u2018Pegasus\u2019 nor in fact most proper names\nof natural languages are genuine \u2018logical\u2019 proper names.\nHe held the epistemological view that unless one is directly\nacquainted with something, one cannot use in thought or\nlanguage a genuine \u2018logical\u2019 proper name referring to it.\nNor can one entertain a genuine singular thought about it. If one is\nnot directly acquainted with an object, then one must instead form a\ngeneral thought that is not about any particular individual. In fact,\nRussell (1911, 1919) held a dual view of acquaintance: on the one\nhand, he thought that acquaintance is a relation that can only hold\nbetween someone\u2019s mind and his or her own sense data. On the\nother hand, he held the view that one can be acquainted with\nuniversals (such as e.g., colors). If most\u2014if not\nall\u2014names of natural languages are not genuine\n\u2018logical\u2019 names, then what are they and what is their\nfunction in human thought and communication? On Russell\u2019s view,\nthey are \u201cdisguised\u201d or abbreviated definite descriptions,\ni.e., they are short for some definite description. Their logical\nfunction is that of a definite description.\n\nOn the face of it, the grammatical form of the quasi-English sentence\n\u2018the F is G\u2019 indicates that it serves to express a\nsubject-predicate (or singular) proposition true if and only if the\nobject that exemplifies the property expressed by predicate\n\u2018F\u2019 also exemplifies the property expressed by predicate\n\u2018G\u2019. But Russell (1905) designed a method\u2014his famous\ntheory of definite descriptions\u2014for eliminating the English\ndefinite article \u2018the\u2019 (as in \u2018the F\u2019) by\nmeans of a logical formula of first-order logic involving only\nquantifiers and variables. On his analysis, \u2018the F is G\u2019\ncan be paraphrased into the general existentially quantified\nproposition (8):\n\n \u2203x[Fx &\n\u2200y(Fy \u2192 y=x) &\nGx]\n\n\n(8) is true if and only if there is one and only one individual that\nis F and G. This proposition will be false just in\ncase nothing or more than one thing is both F and\nG.\n\nCombined with the assumption that \u2018Pegasus\u2019 is not a name\nbut a disguised definite description\u2014that it is short for e.g.,\n\u2018the winged horse\u2019\u2014Russell\u2019s theory of\ndefinite descriptions thus leads to a solution to the puzzle of true\nnegative existential beliefs. The solution is to accept the second\nhorn of the dilemma: the proposition is not about Pegasus. On this\naccount, one can correctly believe that Pegasus does not exist, since\nwhat one believes is what is expressed by an utterance of (7), namely\nthe true proposition that there does not exist a unique individual\nthat is a winged horse. Clearly, Russell\u2019s solution to the\npuzzle of true negative existential beliefs shows how, in\nBrentano\u2019s own terms, \u201cif someone thinks of something, the\none who is thinking must certainly exist, but the object of his\nthinking need not exist at all\u201d and furthermore the thought may\nbe true.
