    "main_text": "The neo-classical theories of truth || The correspondence theory\n1.1 The correspondence theory\n\nPerhaps the most important of the neo-classical theories for the\ncontemporary literature is the correspondence theory. Ideas that sound\nstrikingly like a correspondence theory are no doubt very old. They\nmight well be found in Aristotle or Aquinas. When we turn to the late\n19th and early 20th centuries where we pick up the story of the\nneo-classical theories of truth, it is clear that ideas about\ncorrespondence were central to the discussions of the time. In spite\nof their importance, however, it is strikingly difficult to find an\naccurate citation in the early 20th century for the received\nneo-classical view. Furthermore, the way the correspondence theory\nactually emerged will provide some valuable reference points for the\ncontemporary debate. For these reasons, we dwell on the origins of the\ncorrespondence theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries at\ngreater length than those of the other neo-classical views, before\nturning to its contemporary neo-classical form. For an overview of the\ncorrespondence theory, see David (2018).\n1.1.1 The origins of the correspondence theory\n\nThe basic idea of the correspondence theory is that what we believe or\nsay is true if it corresponds to the way things actually are \u2013\nto the facts. This idea can be seen in various forms throughout the\nhistory of philosophy. Its modern history starts with the beginnings\nof analytic philosophy at the turn of the 20th century, particularly\nin the work of G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell.\n\nLet us pick up the thread of this story in the years between 1898 and\nabout 1910. These years are marked by Moore and Russell\u2019s\nrejection of idealism. Yet at this point, they do not hold a\ncorrespondence theory of truth. Indeed Moore (1899) sees the\ncorrespondence theory as a source of idealism, and rejects it. Russell\nfollows Moore in this regard. (For discussion of Moore\u2019s early\ncritique of idealism, where he rejects the correspondence theory of\ntruth, see Baldwin (1991). Hylton (1990) provides an extensive\ndiscussion of Russell in the context of British idealism. An overview\nof these issues is given by Baldwin (2018).)\n\nIn this period, Moore and Russell hold a version of the identity\ntheory of truth. They say comparatively little about it, but it\nis stated briefly in Moore (1899; 1902) and Russell (1904). According\nto the identity theory, a true proposition is identical to a\nfact. Specifically, in Moore and Russell\u2019s hands, the theory\nbegins with propositions, understood as the objects of beliefs and\nother propositional attitudes. Propositions are what are believed, and\ngive the contents of beliefs. They are also, according to this theory,\nthe primary bearers of truth. When a proposition is true, it is\nidentical to a fact, and a belief in that proposition is correct.\n(Related ideas about the identity theory and idealism are discussed by\nMcDowell (1994) and further developed by Hornsby (2001).)\n\nThe identity theory Moore and Russell espoused takes truth to be a\nproperty of propositions. Furthermore, taking up an idea familiar to\nreaders of Moore, the property of truth is a simple unanalyzable\nproperty. Facts are understood as simply those propositions which are\ntrue. There are true propositions and false ones, and facts just are\ntrue propositions. There is thus no \u201cdifference between truth\nand the reality to which it is supposed to correspond\u201d (Moore,\n1902, p. 21). (For further discussion of the identity theory of truth,\nsee Baldwin (1991), Candlish (1999), Candlish and Damnjanovic (2018),\nCartwright (1987), Dodd (2000), and the entry on the\n identity theory of truth.)\n\nMoore and Russell came to reject the identity theory of truth in favor\nof a correspondence theory, sometime around 1910 (as we see in Moore,\n1953, which reports lectures he gave in 1910\u20131911, and Russell,\n1910b). They do so because they came to reject the existence of\npropositions. Why? Among reasons, they came to doubt that there could\nbe any such things as false propositions, and then concluded that\nthere are no such things as propositions at all.\n\nWhy did Moore and Russell find false propositions problematic? A full\nanswer to this question is a point of scholarship that would take us\ntoo far afield. (Moore himself lamented that he could not \u201cput\nthe objection in a clear and convincing way\u201d (1953, p. 263), but\nsee Cartwright (1987) and David (2001) for careful and clear\nexploration of the arguments.) But very roughly, the identification of\nfacts with true propositions left them unable to see what a false\nproposition could be other than something which is just like a fact,\nthough false. If such things existed, we would have fact-like things\nin the world, which Moore and Russell now see as enough to make false\npropositions count as true. Hence, they cannot exist, and so there are\nno false propositions. As Russell (1956, p. 223) later says,\npropositions seem to be at best \u201ccurious shadowy things\u201d\nin addition to facts.\n\nAs Cartwright (1987) reminds us, it is useful to think of this\nargument in the context of Russell\u2019s slightly earlier views\nabout propositions. As we see clearly in Russell (1903), for instance,\nhe takes propositions to have constituents. But they are not mere\ncollections of constituents, but a \u2018unity\u2019 which brings\nthe constituents together. (We thus confront the \u2018problem of the\nunity of the proposition\u2019.) But what, we might ask, would be the\n\u2018unity\u2019 of a proposition that Samuel Ramey sings \u2013\nwith constituents Ramey and singing \u2013 except Ramey bearing the\nproperty of singing? If that is what the unity consists in, then we\nseem to have nothing other than the fact that Ramey sings. But then we\ncould not have genuine false propositions without having false\nfacts.\n\nAs Cartwright also reminds us, there is some reason to doubt the\ncogency of this sort of argument. But let us put the assessment of the\narguments aside, and continue the story. From the rejection of\npropositions a correspondence theory emerges. The primary bearers of\ntruth are no longer propositions, but beliefs themselves. In a\nslogan:\n\nA belief is true if and only if it corresponds to a fact.\n\n\nViews like this are held by Moore (1953) and Russell (1910b; 1912). Of\ncourse, to understand such a theory, we need to understand the crucial\nrelation of correspondence, as well as the notion of a fact to which a\nbelief corresponds. We now turn to these questions. In doing so, we\nwill leave the history, and present a somewhat more modern\nreconstruction of a correspondence theory. (For more on facts and\nproposition in this period, see Sullivan and Johnston (2018).)\n1.1.2 The neo-classical correspondence theory\n\nThe correspondence theory of truth is at its core an ontological\nthesis: a belief is true if there exists an appropriate\nentity \u2013 a fact \u2013 to which it corresponds. If there is no\nsuch entity, the belief is false.\n\nFacts, for the neo-classical correspondence theory, are entities in\ntheir own right. Facts are generally taken to be composed of\nparticulars and properties and relations or universals, at least. The\nneo-classical correspondence theory thus only makes sense within the\nsetting of a metaphysics that includes such facts. Hence, it is no\naccident that as Moore and Russell turn away from the identity theory\nof truth, the metaphysics of facts takes on a much more significant\nrole in their views. This perhaps becomes most vivid in the later\nRussell (1956, p. 182), where the existence of facts is the\n\u201cfirst truism.\u201d (The influence of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nideas to appear in the Tractatus (1922) on Russell in this\nperiod was strong, and indeed, the Tractatus remains one of\nthe important sources for the neo-classical correspondence theory. For\nmore recent extensive discussions of facts, see Armstrong (1997) and\nNeale (2001).)\n\nConsider, for example, the belief that Ramey sings. Let us grant that\nthis belief is true. In what does its truth consist, according to the\ncorrespondence theory? It consists in there being a fact in the world,\nbuilt from the individual Ramey, and the property of singing. Let us\ndenote this \\(\\langle\\)Ramey, Singing\\(\\rangle\\). This fact\nexists. In contrast, the world (we presume) contains no fact\n\\(\\langle\\)Ramey, Dancing\\(\\rangle\\). The belief that Ramey sings\nstands in the relation of correspondence to the fact\n\\(\\langle\\)Ramey, Singing\\(\\rangle\\), and so the belief is\ntrue.\n\nWhat is the relation of correspondence? One of the standing objections\nto the classical correspondence theory is that a fully adequate\nexplanation of correspondence proves elusive. But for a simple belief,\nlike that Ramey sings, we can observe that the structure of the fact\n\\(\\langle\\)Ramey, Singing\\(\\rangle\\) matches the subject-predicate\nform of the that-clause which reports the belief, and may\nwell match the structure of the belief itself.\n\nSo far, we have very much the kind of view that Moore and Russell\nwould have found congenial. But the modern form of the correspondence\ntheory seeks to round out the explanation of correspondence by appeal\nto propositions. Indeed, it is common to base a\ncorrespondence theory of truth upon the notion of a structured\nproposition. Propositions are again cast as the contents of\nbeliefs and assertions, and propositions have structure which at least\nroughly corresponds to the structure of sentences. At least, for\nsimple beliefs like that Ramey sings, the proposition has the same\nsubject predicate structure as the sentence. (Proponents of structured\npropositions, such as Kaplan (1989), often look to Russell (1903) for\ninspiration, and find unconvincing Russell\u2019s reasons for\nrejecting them.)\n\nWith facts and structured propositions in hand, an attempt may be made\nto explain the relation of correspondence. Correspondence holds\nbetween a proposition and a fact when the proposition and fact have\nthe same structure, and the same constituents at each structural\nposition. When they correspond, the proposition and fact thus mirror\neach-other. In our simple example, we might have:\n\n\\[\\begin{matrix}\n\\text{proposition that} & \\text{Ramey}   & \\text{sings}   \\\\\n                        & \\downarrow     & \\downarrow     \\\\\n\\text{fact}             & \\langle Ramey, & Singing \\rangle\n\\end{matrix}\\]\n\n\nPropositions, though structured like facts, can be true or false. In a\nfalse case, like the proposition that Ramey dances, we would find no\nfact at the bottom of the corresponding diagram. Beliefs are true or\nfalse depending on whether the propositions which are believed\nare.\n\nWe have sketched this view for simple propositions like the\nproposition that Ramey sings. How to extend it to more complex cases,\nlike general propositions or negative propositions, is an issue we\nwill not delve into here. It requires deciding whether there are\ncomplex facts, such as general facts or negative facts, or whether\nthere is a more complex relation of correspondence between complex\npropositions and simple facts. (The issue of whether there are such\ncomplex facts marks a break between Russell (1956) and Wittgenstein\n(1922) and the earlier views which Moore (1953) and Russell (1912)\nsketch.)\n\nAccording to the correspondence theory as sketched here, what is key\nto truth is a relation between propositions and the world, which\nobtains when the world contains a fact that is structurally similar to\nthe proposition. Though this is not the theory Moore and Russell held,\nit weaves together ideas of theirs with a more modern take on\n(structured) propositions. We will thus dub it the neo-classical\ncorrespondence theory. This theory offers us a paradigm example of a\ncorrespondence theory of truth.\n\nThe leading idea of the correspondence theory is familiar. It is a\nform of the older idea that true beliefs show the right kind of\nresemblance to what is believed. In contrast to earlier\nempiricist theories, the thesis is not that one\u2019s ideas per\nse resemble what they are about. Rather, the propositions which\ngive the contents of one\u2019s true beliefs mirror reality, in\nvirtue of entering into correspondence relations to the right pieces\nof it.\n\nIn this theory, it is the way the world provides us with appropriately\nstructured entities that explains truth. Our metaphysics thus explains\nthe nature of truth, by providing the entities needed to enter into\ncorrespondence relations.\n\nFor more on the correspondence theory, see David (1994, 2018) and the\nentry on the\n correspondance theory of truth.\n1.2 The coherence theory\n\nThough initially the correspondence theory was seen by its developers\nas a competitor to the identity theory of truth, it was also\nunderstood as opposed to the coherence theory of truth.\n\nWe will be much briefer with the historical origins of the coherence\ntheory than we were with the correspondence theory. Like the\ncorrespondence theory, versions of the coherence theory can be seen\nthroughout the history of philosophy. (See, for instance, Walker\n(1989) for a discussion of its early modern lineage.) Like the\ncorrespondence theory, it was important in the early 20th century\nBritish origins of analytic philosophy. Particularly, the coherence\ntheory of truth is associated with the British idealists to whom Moore\nand Russell were reacting.\n\nMany idealists at that time did indeed hold coherence theories. Let us\ntake as an example Joachim (1906). (This is the theory that Russell\n(1910a) attacks.) Joachim says that:\n\nTruth in its essential nature is that systematic coherence which is\nthe character of a significant whole (p. 76).\n\n\nWe will not attempt a full exposition of Joachim\u2019s view, which\nwould take us well beyond the discussion of truth into the details of\nBritish idealism. But a few remarks about his theory will help to give\nsubstance to the quoted passage.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Joachim talks of \u2018truth\u2019 in the\nsingular. This is not merely a turn of phrase, but a reflection of his\nmonistic idealism. Joachim insists that what is true is the\n\u201cwhole complete truth\u201d (p. 90). Individual judgments or\nbeliefs are certainly not the whole complete truth. Such judgments\nare, according to Joachim, only true to a degree. One aspect of this\ndoctrine is a kind of holism about content, which holds that any\nindividual belief or judgment gets its content only in virtue of being\npart of a system of judgments. But even these systems are only true to\na degree, measuring the extent to which they express the content of\nthe single \u2018whole complete truth\u2019. Any real judgment we\nmight make will only be partially true.\n\nTo flesh out Joachim\u2019s theory, we would have to explain what a\nsignificant whole is. We will not attempt that, as it leads us to some\nof the more formidable aspects of his view, e.g., that it is a\n\u201cprocess of self-fulfillment\u201d (p. 77). But it is clear\nthat Joachim takes \u2018systematic coherence\u2019 to be stronger\nthan consistency. In keeping with his holism about content, he rejects\nthe idea that coherence is a relation between independently identified\ncontents, and so finds it necessary to appeal to \u2018significant\nwholes\u2019.\n\nAs with the correspondence theory, it will be useful to recast the\ncoherence theory in a more modern form, which will abstract away from\nsome of the difficult features of British idealism. As with the\ncorrespondence theory, it can be put in a slogan:\n\nA belief is true if and only if it is part of a coherent system of\nbeliefs.\n\n\nTo further the contrast with the neo-classical correspondence theory,\nwe may add that a proposition is true if it is the content of a belief\nin the system, or entailed by a belief in the system. We may assume,\nwith Joachim, that the condition of coherence will be stronger than\nconsistency. With the idealists generally, we might suppose that\nfeatures of the believing subject will come into play. \n\nThis theory is offered as an analysis of the nature of truth, and not\nsimply a test or criterion for truth. Put as such, it is clearly not\nJoachim\u2019s theory (it lacks his monism, and he rejects\npropositions), but it is a standard take on coherence in the\ncontemporary literature. (It is the way the coherence theory is given\nin Walker (1989), for instance. See also Young (2001) for a recent\ndefense of a coherence theory.) Let us take this as our neo-classical\nversion of the coherence theory. The contrast with the correspondence\ntheory of truth is clear. Far from being a matter of whether the world\nprovides a suitable object to mirror a proposition, truth is a matter\nof how beliefs are related to each-other.\n\nThe coherence theory of truth enjoys two sorts of motivations. One is\nprimarily epistemological. Most coherence theorists also hold a\ncoherence theory of knowledge; more specifically, a coherence theory\nof justification. According to this theory, to be justified is to be\npart of a coherent system of beliefs. An argument for this is often\nbased on the claim that only another belief could stand in a\njustification relation to a belief, allowing nothing but properties of\nsystems of belief, including coherence, to be conditions for\njustification. Combining this with the thesis that a fully justified\nbelief is true forms an argument for the coherence theory of truth.\n(An argument along these lines is found in Blanshard (1939), who holds\na form of the coherence theory closely related to\nJoachim\u2019s.)\n\nThe steps in this argument may be questioned by a number of\ncontemporary epistemological views. But the coherence theory also goes\nhand-in-hand with its own metaphysics as well. The coherence theory is\ntypically associated with idealism. As we have already discussed,\nforms of it were held by British idealists such as Joachim, and later\nby Blanshard (in America). An idealist should see the last step in the\njustification argument as quite natural. More generally, an idealist\nwill see little (if any) room between a system of beliefs and the\nworld it is about, leaving the coherence theory of truth as an\nextremely natural option.\n\nIt is possible to be an idealist without adopting a coherence theory.\n(For instance, many scholars read Bradley as holding a version of the\nidentity theory of truth. See Baldwin (1991) for some discussion.)\nHowever, it is hard to see much of a way to hold the coherence theory\nof truth without maintaining some form of idealism. If there is\nnothing to truth beyond what is to be found in an appropriate system\nof beliefs, then it would seem one\u2019s beliefs constitute the\nworld in a way that amounts to idealism. (Walker (1989) argues that\nevery coherence theorist must be an idealist, but not vice-versa.)\n\nThe neo-classical correspondence theory seeks to capture the intuition\nthat truth is a content-to-world relation. It captures this in the\nmost straightforward way, by asking for an object in the world to pair\nup with a true proposition. The neo-classical coherence theory, in\ncontrast, insists that truth is not a content-to-world relation at\nall; rather, it is a content-to-content, or belief-to-belief,\nrelation. The coherence theory requires some metaphysics which can\nmake the world somehow reflect this, and idealism appears to be it. (A\ndistant descendant of the neo-classical coherence theory that does not\nrequire idealism will be discussed in section 6.5 below.)\n\nFor more on the coherence theory, see Walker (2018) and the entry on\nthe\n coherence theory of truth.\n1.3 Pragmatist theories\n\nA different perspective on truth was offered by the American\npragmatists. As with the neo-classical correspondence and coherence\ntheories, the pragmatist theories go with some typical slogans. For\nexample, Peirce is usually understood as holding the view that:\n\nTruth is the end of inquiry.\n\n\n(See, for instance Hartshorne et al., 1931\u201358, \u00a73.432.)\nBoth Peirce and James are associated with the slogan that:\n\nTruth is satisfactory to believe.\n\n\nJames (e.g., 1907) understands this principle as telling us what\npractical value truth has. True beliefs are guaranteed not to conflict\nwith subsequent experience. Likewise, Peirce\u2019s slogan tells us\nthat true beliefs will remain settled at the end of prolonged inquiry.\nPeirce\u2019s slogan is perhaps most typically associated with\npragmatist views of truth, so we might take it to be our canonical\nneo-classical theory. However, the contemporary literature does not\nseem to have firmly settled upon a received\n\u2018neo-classical\u2019 pragmatist theory.\n\nIn her reconstruction (upon which we have relied heavily), Haack\n(1976) notes that the pragmatists\u2019 views on truth also make room\nfor the idea that truth involves a kind of correspondence, insofar as\nthe scientific method of inquiry is answerable to some independent\nworld. Peirce, for instance, does not reject a correspondence theory\noutright; rather, he complains that it provides merely a\n\u2018nominal\u2019 or \u2018transcendental\u2019 definition of\ntruth (e.g Hartshorne et al., 1931\u201358, \u00a75.553,\n\u00a75.572), which is cut off from practical matters of experience,\nbelief, and doubt (\u00a75.416). (See Misak (2004) for an extended\ndiscussion.)\n\nThis marks an important difference between the pragmatist theories and\nthe coherence theory we just considered. Even so, pragmatist theories\nalso have an affinity with coherence theories, insofar as we expect\nthe end of inquiry to be a coherent system of beliefs. As Haack also\nnotes, James maintains an important verificationist idea: truth is\nwhat is verifiable. We will see this idea re-appear in section 4.\n\nFor more on pragmatist theories of truth, see Misak (2018).\nJames\u2019 views are discussed further in the entry on\n William James.\n Peirce\u2019s views are discussed further in the entry on\n Charles Sanders Peirce.\n2. Tarski\u2019s theory of truth\n\nModern forms of the classical theories survive. Many of these modern\ntheories, notably correspondence theories, draw on ideas developed by\nTarski.\n\nIn this regard, it is important to bear in mind that his seminal work\non truth (1935) is very much of a piece with other works in\nmathematical logic, such as his (1931), and as much as anything this\nwork lays the ground-work for the modern subject of model theory\n\u2013 a branch of mathematical logic, not the metaphysics of truth.\nIn this respect, Tarski\u2019s work provides a set of highly useful\ntools that may be employed in a wide range of philosophical projects.\n(See Patterson (2012) for more on Tarski\u2019s work in its\nhistorical context.)\n\nTarski\u2019s work has a number of components, which we will consider\nin turn.\n2.1 Sentences as truth-bearers\n\nIn the classical debate on truth at the beginning of the 20th century\nwe considered in section 1, the issue of truth-bearers was of great\nsignificance. For instance, Moore and Russell\u2019s turn to the\ncorrespondence theory was driven by their views on whether there are\npropositions to be the bearers of truth. Many theories we reviewed\ntook beliefs to be the bearers of truth.\n\nIn contrast, Tarski and much of the subsequent work on truth takes\nsentences to be the primary bearers of truth. This is not an\nentirely novel development: Russell (1956) also takes truth to apply\nto sentence (which he calls \u2018propositions\u2019 in that text).\nBut whereas much of the classical debate takes the issue of the\nprimary bearers of truth to be a substantial and important\nmetaphysical one, Tarski is quite casual about it. His primary reason\nfor taking sentences as truth-bearers is convenience, and he\nexplicitly distances himself from any commitment about the\nphilosophically contentious issues surrounding other candidate\ntruth-bearers (e.g., Tarski, 1944). (Russell (1956) makes a similar\nsuggestion that sentences are the appropriate truth-bearers \u201cfor\nthe purposes of logic\u201d (p. 184), though he still takes the\nclassical metaphysical issues to be important.)\n\nWe will return to the issue of the primary bearers of truth in section\n6.1. For the moment, it will be useful to simply follow Tarski\u2019s\nlead. But it should be stressed that for this discussion, sentences\nare fully interpreted sentences, having meanings. We will\nalso assume that the sentences in question do not change their content\nacross occasions of use, i.e., that they display no\ncontext-dependence. We are taking sentences to be what Quine (1960)\ncalls \u2018eternal sentences\u2019.\n\nIn some places (e.g., Tarski, 1944), Tarski refers to his view as the\n\u2018semantic conception of truth\u2019. It is not entirely clear\njust what Tarski had in mind by this, but it is clear enough that\nTarski\u2019s theory defines truth for sentences in terms of concepts\nlike reference and satisfaction, which are intimately related to the\nbasic semantic functions of names and predicates (according to many\napproaches to semantics). For more discussion, see Wole\u0144ski\n(2001). \n2.2 Convention T\n\nLet us suppose we have a fixed language \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) whose\nsentences are fully interpreted. The basic question Tarski poses is\nwhat an adequate theory of truth for \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) would\nbe. Tarski\u2019s answer is embodied in what he calls Convention\nT:\n\nAn adequate theory of truth for \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) must imply, for\neach sentence \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{L}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is true if and only if \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\n(We have simplified Tarski\u2019s presentation somewhat.) This is an\nadequacy condition for theories, not a theory itself. Given the\nassumption that \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is fully interpreted, we may assume\nthat each sentence \\(\\phi\\) in fact has a truth value. In light of this,\nConvention T guarantees that the truth predicate given by the theory\nwill be extensionally correct, i.e., have as its extension\nall and only the true sentences of \\(\\mathbf{L}\\).\n\nConvention T draws our attention to the biconditionals of the form\n\n\\(\\ulcorner \\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\)\nis true if and only if \\(\\phi \\urcorner\\),\n\n\nwhich are usually called the Tarski biconditionals for a\nlanguage \\(\\mathbf{L}\\).\n2.3 Recursive definition of truth\n\nTarski does not merely propose a condition of adequacy for theories of\ntruth, he also shows how to meet it. One of his insights is that if\nthe language \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) displays the right structure, then\ntruth for \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) can be defined recursively. For instance,\nlet us suppose that \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is a simple formal language,\ncontaining two atomic sentences \u2018snow is white\u2019 and\n\u2018grass is green\u2019, and the sentential connectives \\(\\vee\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\).\n\nIn spite of its simplicity, \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) contains infinitely\nmany distinct sentences. But truth can be defined for all of them by\nrecursion.\n\nBase clauses:\n\n\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 is true if and only if snow is\nwhite.\n\u2018Grass is green\u2019 is true if and only if grass is\ngreen.\n\nRecursion clauses. For any sentences \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\):\n\n\n \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\vee \\psi \\urcorner\\) is true if\nand only if \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is true or\n\\(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urcorner\\) is true.\n \\(\\ulcorner \\neg \\phi \\urcorner\\) is true if and\nonly if it is not the case that \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is true.\n\n\n\nThis theory satisfies Convention T.\n2.4 Reference and satisfaction\n\nThis may look trivial, but in defining an extensionally correct truth\npredicate for an infinite language with four clauses, we have made a\nmodest application of a very powerful technique.\n\nTarski\u2019s techniques go further, however. They do not stop with\natomic sentences. Tarski notes that truth for each atomic sentence can\nbe defined in terms of two closely related notions: reference\nand satisfaction. Let us consider a language\n\\(\\mathbf{L}'\\), just like \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) except that\ninstead of simply having two atomic sentences,\n\\(\\mathbf{L}'\\) breaks atomic sentences into terms and\npredicates. \\(\\mathbf{L}'\\) contains terms\n\u2018snow\u2019 and \u2018grass\u2019 (let us engage in the\nidealization that these are simply singular terms), and predicates\n\u2018is white\u2019 and \u2018is green\u2019. So\n\\(\\mathbf{L}'\\) is like \\(\\mathbf{L}\\), but also\ncontains the sentences \u2018Snow is green\u2019 and \u2018Grass is\nwhite\u2019.)\n\nWe can define truth for atomic sentences of \\(\\mathbf{L}'\\)\nin the following way.\n\nBase clauses:\n\n\n\u2018Snow\u2019 refers to snow.\n\u2018Grass\u2019 refers to grass.\n\\(a\\) satisfies \u2018is white\u2019 if and only if\n\\(a\\) is white.\n\\(a\\) satisfies \u2018is green\u2019 if and only if\n\\(a\\) is green.\n\nFor any atomic sentence \\(\\ulcorner t\\) is\n\\(P \\urcorner\\): \\(\\ulcorner t\\) is\n\\(P \\urcorner\\) is true if and only if the referent of\n\\(\\ulcorner t \\urcorner\\) satisfies\n\\(\\ulcorner P\\urcorner\\).\n\n\nOne of Tarski\u2019s key insights is that the apparatus of\nsatisfaction allows for a recursive definition of truth for sentences\nwith quantifiers, though we will not examine that here. We\ncould repeat the recursion clauses for \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) to produce a\nfull theory of truth for \\(\\mathbf{L}'\\).\n\nLet us say that a Tarskian theory of truth is a recursive theory,\nbuilt up in ways similar to the theory of truth for\n\\(\\mathbf{L}'\\). Tarski goes on to demonstrate some key\napplications of such a theory of truth. A Tarskian theory of truth for\na language \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) can be used to show that theories in\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\) are consistent. This was especially important to\nTarski, who was concerned the Liar paradox would make theories in\nlanguages containing a truth predicate inconsistent.\n\nFor more, see Ray (2018) and the entries on\n axiomatic theories of truth,\n the\n Liar paradox,\n and\n Tarski\u2019s truth definitions.\n3. Correspondence revisited\n\nThe correspondence theory of truth expresses the very natural idea\nthat truth is a content-to-world or word-to-world relation: what we\nsay or think is true or false in virtue of the way the world turns out\nto be. We suggested that, against a background like the metaphysics of\nfacts, it does so in a straightforward way. But the idea of\ncorrespondence is certainly not specific to this framework. Indeed, it\nis controversial whether a correspondence theory should rely on any\nparticular metaphysics at all. The basic idea of correspondence, as\nTarski (1944) and others have suggested, is captured in the slogan\nfrom Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics \u0393 7.27, \u201cto\nsay of what is that it is, or of what is not that it is not, is\ntrue\u201d (Ross, 1928). \u2018What is\u2019, it is natural enough\nto say, is a fact, but this natural turn of phrase may well not\nrequire a full-blown metaphysics of facts. (For a discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s views in a historical context, see Szaif\n(2018).)\n\nYet without the metaphysics of facts, the notion of correspondence as\ndiscussed in section 1.1 loses substance. This has led to two distinct\nstrands in contemporary thinking about the correspondence theory. One\nstrand seeks to recast the correspondence theory in a way that does\nnot rely on any particular ontology. Another seeks to find an\nappropriate ontology for correspondence, either in terms of facts or\nother entities. We will consider each in turn.\n3.1 Correspondence without facts\n\nTarski himself sometimes suggested that his theory was a kind of\ncorrespondence theory of truth. Whether his own theory is a\ncorrespondence theory, and even whether it provides any substantial\nphilosophical account of truth at all, is a matter of controversy.\n(One rather drastic negative assessment from Putnam (1985\u201386, p.\n333) is that \u201cAs a philosophical account of truth,\nTarski\u2019s theory fails as badly as it is possible for an account\nto fail.\u201d) But a number of philosophers (e.g., Davidson, 1969;\nField, 1972) have seen Tarski\u2019s theory as providing at least the\ncore of a correspondence theory of truth which dispenses with the\nmetaphysics of facts.\n\nTarski\u2019s theory shows how truth for a sentence is\ndetermined by certain properties of its constituents; in\nparticular, by properties of reference and satisfaction (as well as by\nthe logical constants). As it is normally understood, reference is the\npreeminent word-to-world relation. Satisfaction is naturally\nunderstood as a word-to-world relation as well, which relates a\npredicate to the things in the world that bear it. The Tarskian\nrecursive definition shows how truth is determined by reference and\nsatisfaction, and so is in effect determined by the things in the\nworld we refer to and the properties they bear. This, one might\npropose, is all the correspondence we need. It is not correspondence\nof sentences or propositions to facts; rather, it is correspondence of\nour expressions to objects and the properties they bear, and then ways\nof working out the truth of claims in terms of this.\n\nThis is certainly not the neo-classical idea of correspondence. In not\npositing facts, it does not posit any single object to which a true\nproposition or sentence might correspond. Rather, it shows how truth\nmight be worked out from basic word-to-world relations. However, a\nnumber of authors have noted that Tarski\u2019s theory cannot by\nitself provide us with such an account of truth. As we will discuss\nmore fully in section 4.2, Tarski\u2019s apparatus is in fact\ncompatible with theories of truth that are certainly not\ncorrespondence theories.\n\nField (1972), in an influential discussion and diagnosis of what is\nlacking in Tarski\u2019s account, in effect points out that whether\nwe really have something worthy of the name\n\u2018correspondence\u2019 depends on our having notions of\nreference and satisfaction which genuinely establish word-to-world\nrelations. (Field does not use the term \u2018correspondence\u2019,\nbut does talk about e.g., the \u201cconnection between words and\nthings\u201d (p. 373).) By itself, Field notes, Tarski\u2019s theory\ndoes not offer an account of reference and satisfaction at all.\nRather, it offers a number of disquotation clauses, such\nas:\n\n\u2018Snow\u2019 refers to snow.\n\\(a\\) satisfies \u2018is white\u2019 if and only if\n\\(a\\) is white.\n\n\nThese clauses have an air of triviality (though whether they are to be\nunderstood as trivial principles or statements of non-trivial semantic\nfacts has been a matter of some debate). With Field, we might propose\nto supplement clauses like these with an account of reference and\nsatisfaction. Such a theory should tell us what makes it the case that\nthe word \u2018snow\u2019 refer to snow. (In 1972, Field was\nenvisaging a physicalist account, along the lines of the causal theory\nof reference.) This should inter alia guarantee that truth is\nreally determined by word-to-world relations, so in conjunction with\nthe Tarskian recursive definition, it could provide a correspondence\ntheory of truth.\n\nSuch a theory clearly does not rely on a metaphysics of facts. Indeed,\nit is in many ways metaphysically neutral, as it does not take a stand\non the nature of particulars, or of the properties or universals that\nunderwrite facts about satisfaction. However, it may not be entirely\ndevoid of metaphysical implications, as we will discuss further in\nsection 4.1.\n3.2 Representation and Correspondence\n\nMuch of the subsequent discussion of Field-style approaches to\ncorrespondence has focused on the role of representation in these\nviews. Field\u2019s own (1972) discussion relies on a causal relation\nbetween terms and their referents, and a similar relation for\nsatisfaction. These are instances of representation relations.\nAccording to representational views, meaningful items, like perhaps\nthoughts or sentences or their constituents, have their contents in\nvirtue of standing in the right relation to the things they\nrepresent. On many views, including Field\u2019s, a name stands in\nsuch a relation to its bearer, and the relation is a causal one.\n\nThe project of developing a naturalist account of the representation\nrelation has been an important one in the philosophy of mind and\nlanguage. (See the entry on\n mental representation.)\n But, it has implications for the theory of truth. Representational\nviews of content lead naturally to correspondence theories of truth.\nTo make this vivid, suppose you hold that sentences or beliefs stand\nin a representation relation to some objects. It is natural to suppose\nthat for true beliefs or sentences, those objects would be facts. We\nthen have a correspondence theory, with the correspondence relation\nexplicated as a representation relation: a truth bearer is true if it\nrepresents a fact.\n\nAs we have discussed, many contemporary views reject facts, but one\ncan hold a representational view of content without them. One\ninterpretation of Field\u2019s theory is just that. The relations of\nreference and satisfaction are representation relations, and truth for\nsentences is determined compositionally in terms of those\nrepresentation relations, and the nature of the objects they\nrepresent. If we have such relations, we have the building blocks for\na correspondence theory without facts. Field (1972) anticipated a\nnaturalist reduction of the representation via a causal theory, but\nany view that accepts representation relations for truth bearers or\ntheir constituents can provide a similar theory of truth. (See Jackson\n(2006) and Lynch (2009) for further discussion.)\n\nRepresentational views of content provide a natural way to approach\nthe correspondence theory of truth, and likewise,\nanti-representational views provide a natural way to avoid the\ncorrespondence theory of truth. This is most clear in the work of\nDavidson, as we will discuss more in section 6.5.\n3.3 Facts again\n\nThere have been a number of correspondence theories that do make use\nof facts. Some are notably different from the neo-classical theory\nsketched in section 1.1. For instance, Austin (1950) proposes a view\nin which each statement (understood roughly as an utterance event)\ncorresponds to both a fact or situation, and a type of situation. It\nis true if the former is of the latter type. This theory, which has\nbeen developed by situation theory (e.g., Barwise and Perry,\n1986), rejects the idea that correspondence is a kind of mirroring\nbetween a fact and a proposition. Rather, correspondence relations to\nAustin are entirely conventional. (See Vision (2004) for an extended\ndefense of an Austinian correspondence theory.) As an ordinary\nlanguage philosopher, Austin grounds his notion of fact more in\nlinguistic usage than in an articulated metaphysics, but he defends\nhis use of fact-talk in Austin (1961b).\n\nIn a somewhat more Tarskian spirit, formal theories of facts or states\nof affairs have also been developed. For instance, Taylor (1976)\nprovides a recursive definition of a collection of \u2018states of\naffairs\u2019 for a given language. Taylor\u2019s states of affairs\nseem to reflect the notion of fact at work in the neo-classical\ntheory, though as an exercise in logic, they are officially\n\\(n\\)-tuples of objects and intensions.\n\nThere are more metaphysically robust notions of fact in the current\nliterature. For instance, Armstrong (1997) defends a metaphysics in\nwhich facts (under the name \u2018states of affairs\u2019) are\nmetaphysically fundamental. The view has much in common with the\nneo-classical one. Like the neo-classical view, Armstrong endorses a\nversion of the correspondence theory. States of affairs are\ntruthmakers for propositions, though Armstrong argues that\nthere may be many such truthmakers for a given proposition, and vice\nversa. (Armstrong also envisages a naturalistic account of\npropositions as classes of equivalent belief-tokens.)\n\nArmstrong\u2019s primary argument is what he calls the\n\u2018truthmaker argument\u2019. It begins by advancing a\ntruthmaker principle, which holds that for any given truth,\nthere must be a truthmaker \u2013 a \u201csomething in the world\nwhich makes it the case, that serves as an ontological ground, for\nthis truth\u201d (p. 115). It is then argued that facts are the\nappropriate truthmakers.\n\nIn contrast to the approach to correspondence discussed in section\n3.1, which offered correspondence with minimal ontological\nimplications, this view returns to the ontological basis of\ncorrespondence that was characteristic of the neo-classical\ntheory.\n\nFor more on facts, see the entry on\n facts.\n3.4 Truthmakers\n\nThe truthmaker principle is often put as the schema:\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\), then there is an \\(x\\) such that necessarily, if\n\\(x\\) exists, then \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\n(Fox (1987) proposed putting the principle this way, rather than\nexplicitly in terms of truth.)\n\nThe truthmaker principle expresses the ontological aspect of\nthe neo-classical correspondence theory. Not merely must truth obtain\nin virtue of word-to-world relations, but there must be a thing that\nmakes each truth true. (For one view on this, see Merricks\n(2007).)\n\nThe neo-classical correspondence theory, and Armstrong, cast facts as\nthe appropriate truthmakers. However, it is a non-trivial step from\nthe truthmaker principle to the existence of facts. There are a number\nof proposals in the literature for how other sorts of objects could be\ntruthmakers; for instance, tropes (called \u2018moments\u2019, in\nMulligan et\u00a0al., 1984). Parsons (1999) argues that the truthmaker\nprinciple (presented in a somewhat different form) is compatible with\nthere being only concrete particulars.\n\nAs we saw in discussing the neo-classical correspondence theory,\ntruthmaker theories, and fact theories in particular, raise a number\nof issues. One which has been discussed at length, for instance, is\nwhether there are negative facts. Negative facts would be the\ntruthmakers for negated sentences. Russell (1956) notoriously\nexpresses ambivalence about whether there are negative facts.\nArmstrong (1997) rejects them, while Beall (2000) defends them. (For\nmore discussion of truthmakers, see Cameron (2018) and the papers in\nBeebee and Dodd (2005).)\n4. Realism and anti-realism\n\nThe neo-classical theories we surveyed in section 1 made the theory of\ntruth an application of their background metaphysics (and in some\ncases epistemology). In section 2 and especially in section 3, we\nreturned to the issue of what sorts of ontological commitments might\ngo with the theory of truth. There we saw a range of options, from\nrelatively ontologically non-committal theories, to theories requiring\nhighly specific ontologies.\n\nThere is another way in which truth relates to metaphysics. Many ideas\nabout realism and anti-realism are closely related to ideas about\ntruth. Indeed, many approaches to questions about realism and\nanti-realism simply make them questions about truth.\n4.1 Realism and truth\n\nIn discussing the approach to correspondence of section 3.1, we noted\nthat it has few ontological requirements. It relies on there being\nobjects of reference, and something about the world which makes for\ndeterminate satisfaction relations; but beyond that, it is\nontologically neutral. But as we mentioned there, this is not to say\nthat it has no metaphysical implications. A correspondence theory of\ntruth, of any kind, is often taken to embody a form of\nrealism.\n\nThe key features of realism, as we will take it, are that:\n\nThe world exists objectively, independently of the ways we think\nabout it or describe it.\nOur thoughts and claims are about that world.\n\n\n(Wright (1992) offers a nice statement of this way of thinking about\nrealism.) These theses imply that our claims are objectively true or\nfalse, depending on how the world they are about is. The world that we\nrepresent in our thoughts or language is an objective world. (Realism\nmay be restricted to some subject-matter, or range of discourse, but\nfor simplicity, we will talk about only its global form.)\n\nIt is often argued that these theses require some form of the\ncorrespondence theory of truth. (Putnam (1978, p. 18) notes,\n\u201cWhatever else realists say, they typically say that they\nbelieve in a \u2018correspondence theory of truth\u2019.\u201d) At\nleast, they are supported by the kind of correspondence theory without\nfacts discussed in section 3.1, such as Field\u2019s proposal. Such a\ntheory will provide an account of objective relations of reference and\nsatisfaction, and show how these determine the truth or falsehood of\nwhat we say about the world. Field\u2019s own approach (1972) to this\nproblem seeks a physicalist explanation of reference. But realism is a\nmore general idea than physicalism. Any theory that provides objective\nrelations of reference and satisfaction, and builds up a theory of\ntruth from them, would give a form of realism. (Making the objectivity\nof reference the key to realism is characteristic of work of Putnam,\ne.g., 1978.)\n\nAnother important mark of realism expressed in terms of truth is the\nproperty of bivalence. As Dummett has stressed (e.g., 1959;\n1976; 1983; 1991), a realist should see there being a fact of the\nmatter one way or the other about whether any given claim is correct.\nHence, one important mark of realism is that it goes together with the\nprinciple of bivalence: every truth-bearer (sentence or\nproposition) is true or false. In much of his work, Dummett has made\nthis the characteristic mark of realism, and often identifies realism\nabout some subject-matter with accepting bivalence for discourse about\nthat subject-matter. At the very least, it captures a great deal of\nwhat is more loosely put in the statement of realism above.\n\nBoth the approaches to realism, through reference and through\nbivalence, make truth the primary vehicle for an account of realism. A\ntheory of truth which substantiates bivalence, or builds truth from a\ndeterminate reference relation, does most of the work of giving a\nrealistic metaphysics. It might even simply be a realistic\nmetaphysics.\n\nWe have thus turned on its head the relation of truth to metaphysics\nwe saw in our discussion of the neo-classical correspondence theory in\nsection 1.1. There, a correspondence theory of truth was built upon a\nsubstantial metaphysics. Here, we have seen how articulating a theory\nthat captures the idea of correspondence can be crucial to providing a\nrealist metaphysics. (For another perspective on realism and truth,\nsee Alston (1996). Devitt (1984) offers an opposing view to the kind\nwe have sketched here, which rejects any characterization of realism\nin terms of truth or other semantic concepts.)\n\nIn light of our discussion in section 1.1.1, we should pause to note\nthat the connection between realism and the correspondence theory of\ntruth is not absolute. When Moore and Russell held the identity theory\nof truth, they were most certainly realists. The right kind of\nmetaphysics of propositions can support a realist view, as can a\nmetaphysics of facts. The modern form of realism we have been\ndiscussing here seeks to avoid basing itself on such particular\nontological commitments, and so prefers to rely on the kind of\ncorrespondence-without-facts approach discussed in section 3.1. This\nis not to say that realism will be devoid of ontological commitments,\nbut the commitments will flow from whichever specific claims about\nsome subject-matter are taken to be true.\n\nFor more on realism and truth, see Fumerton (2002) and the entry on\n realism.\n4.2 Anti-realism and truth\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the relation between truth and\nmetaphysics seen by modern realists can also be exploited by\nanti-realists. Many modern anti-realists see the theory of truth as\nthe key to formulating and defending their views. With Dummett (e.g.,\n1959; 1976; 1991), we might expect the characteristic mark of\nanti-realism to be the rejection of bivalence.\n\nIndeed, many contemporary forms of anti-realism may be formulated as\ntheories of truth, and they do typically deny bivalence. Anti-realism\ncomes in many forms, but let us take as an example a (somewhat crude)\nform of verificationism. Such a theory holds that a claim is correct\njust insofar as it is in principle verifiable, i.e., there is\na verification procedure we could in principle carry out which would\nyield the answer that the claim in question was verified.\n\nSo understood, verificationism is a theory of truth. The claim is not\nthat verification is the most important epistemic notion, but that\ntruth just is verifiability. As with the kind of realism we\nconsidered in section 4.1, this view expresses its metaphysical\ncommitments in its explanation of the nature of truth. Truth is not,\nto this view, a fully objective matter, independent of us or our\nthoughts. Instead, truth is constrained by our abilities to verify,\nand is thus constrained by our epistemic situation. Truth is to a\nsignificant degree an epistemic matter, which is typical of many\nanti-realist positions.\n\nAs Dummett says, the verificationist notion of truth does not appear\nto support bivalence. Any statement that reaches beyond what we can in\nprinciple verify or refute (verify its negation) will be a\ncounter-example to bivalence. Take, for instance, the claim that there\nis some substance, say uranium, present in some region of the universe\ntoo distant to be inspected by us within the expected lifespan of the\nuniverse. Insofar as this really would be in principle unverifiable,\nwe have no reason to maintain it is true or false according to the\nverificationist theory of truth.\n\nVerificationism of this sort is one of a family of anti-realist views.\nAnother example is the view that identifies truth with warranted\nassertibility. Assertibility, as well as verifiability, has been\nimportant in Dummett\u2019s work. (See also works of McDowell, e.g.,\n1976 and Wright, e.g., 1976; 1982; 1992.)\n\nAnti-realism of the Dummettian sort is not a descendant of the\ncoherence theory of truth per se. But in some ways, as\nDummett himself has noted, it might be construed as a descendant\n\u2013 perhaps very distant \u2013 of idealism. If idealism is the\nmost drastic form of rejection of the independence of mind and world,\nDummettian anti-realism is a more modest form, which sees epistemology\nimprinted in the world, rather than the wholesale embedding of world\ninto mind. At the same time, the idea of truth as warranted\nassertibility or verifiability reiterates a theme from the pragmatist\nviews of truth we surveyed in section 1.3.\n\nAnti-realist theories of truth, like the realist ones we discussed in\nsection 4.1, can generally make use of the Tarskian apparatus.\nConvention T, in particular, does not discriminate between realist and\nanti-realist notions of truth. Likewise, the base clauses of a\nTarskian recursive theory are given as disquotation principles, which\nare neutral between realist and anti-realist understandings of notions\nlike reference. As we saw with the correspondence theory, giving a\nfull account of the nature of truth will generally require more than\nthe Tarskian apparatus itself. How an anti-realist is to explain the\nbasic concepts that go into a Tarskian theory is a delicate matter. As\nDummett and Wright have investigated in great detail, it appears that\nthe background logic in which the theory is developed will have to be\nnon-classical.\n\nFor more on anti-realism and truth, see Shieh (2018) and the papers in\nGreenough and Lynch (2006) and the entry on\n realism.\n4.3 Anti-realism and pragmatism\n\nMany commentators see a close connection between Dummett\u2019s\nanti-realism and the pragmatists\u2019 views of truth, in that both\nput great weight on ideas of verifiability or assertibility. Dummett\nhimself stressed parallels between anti-realism and intuitionism in\nthe philosophy of mathematics.\n\nAnother view on truth which returns to pragmatist themes is the\n\u2018internal realism\u2019 of Putnam (1981). There Putnam glosses\ntruth as what would be justified under ideal epistemic conditions.\nWith the pragmatists, Putnam sees the ideal conditions as something\nwhich can be approximated, echoing the idea of truth as the end of\ninquiry.\n\nPutnam is cautious about calling his view anti-realism, preferring the\nlabel \u2018internal realism\u2019. But he is clear that he sees his\nview as opposed to realism (\u2018metaphysical realism\u2019, as he\ncalls it).\n\nDavidson\u2019s views on truth have also been associated with\npragmatism, notably by Rorty (1986). Davidson has distanced himself\nfrom this interpretation (e.g., 1990), but he does highlight\nconnections between truth and belief and meaning. Insofar as these are\nhuman attitudes or relate to human actions, Davidson grants there is\nsome affinity between his views and those of some pragmatists\n(especially, he says, Dewey).\n4.4 Truth pluralism\n\nAnother view that has grown out of the literature on realism and\nanti-realism, and has become increasingly important in the current\nliterature, is that of pluralism about truth. This view, developed in\nwork of Lynch (e.g. 2001b; 2009) and Wright (e.g. 1992; 1999),\nproposes that there are multiple ways for truth bearers to be true.\nWright, in particular, suggests that in certain domains of discourse\nwhat we say is true in virtue of a correspondence-like relation, while\nin others it is its true in virtue of a kind of assertibility relation\nthat is closer in spirit to the anti-realist views we have just\ndiscussed.\n\nSuch a proposal might suggest there are multiple concepts of truth, or\nthat the term \u2018true\u2019 is itself ambiguous. However, whether\nor not a pluralist view is committed to such claims has been disputed.\nIn particular, Lynch (2001b; 2009) develops a version of pluralism\nwhich takes truth to be a functional role concept. The functional role\nof truth is characterized by a range of principles that articulate\nsuch features of truth as its objectivity, its role in inquiry, and\nrelated ideas we have encountered in considering various theories of\ntruth. (A related point about platitudes governing the concept of\ntruth is made by Wright (1992).) But according to Lynch, these display\nthe functional role of truth. Furthermore, Lynch claims that on\nanalogy with analytic functionalism, these principles can be seen as\nderiving from our pre-theoretic or \u2018folk\u2019 ideas about\ntruth.\n\nLike all functional role concepts, truth must be realized, and\naccording to Lynch it may be realized in different ways in different\nsettings. Such multiple realizability has been one of the hallmarks of\nfunctional role concepts discussed in the philosophy of mind. For\ninstance, Lynch suggests that for ordinary claims about material\nobjects, truth might be realized by a correspondence property (which\nhe links to representational views), while for moral claims truth\nmight be manifest by an assertibility property along more anti-realist\nlines.\n\nFor more on pluralism about truth, see Pedersen and Lynch (2018) and\nthe entry on\n pluralist theories of truth.\n5. Deflationism\n\nWe began in section 1 with the neo-classical theories, which explained\nthe nature of truth within wider metaphysical systems. We then\nconsidered some alternatives in sections 2 and 3, some of which had\nmore modest ontological implications. But we still saw in section 4\nthat substantial theories of truth tend to imply metaphysical theses,\nor even embody metaphysical positions.\n\nOne long-standing trend in the discussion of truth is to insist that\ntruth really does not carry metaphysical significance at all. It does\nnot, as it has no significance on its own. A number of different ideas\nhave been advanced along these lines, under the general heading of\ndeflationism.\n5.1 The redundancy theory\n\nDeflationist ideas appear quite early on, including a well-known\nargument against correspondence in Frege (1918\u201319). However,\nmany deflationists take their cue from an idea of Ramsey (1927), often\ncalled the equivalence thesis:\n\n\\(\\ulcorner \\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\)\nis true \\(\\urcorner\\) has the same meaning as \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\n(Ramsey himself takes truth-bearers to be propositions rather than\nsentences. Glanzberg (2003b) questions whether Ramsey\u2019s account\nof propositions really makes him a deflationist.)\n\nThis can be taken as the core of a theory of truth, often called the\nredundancy theory. The redundancy theory holds that there is\nno property of truth at all, and appearances of the expression\n\u2018true\u2019 in our sentences are redundant, having no effect on\nwhat we express.\n\nThe equivalence thesis can also be understood in terms of speech acts\nrather than meaning:\n\nTo assert that \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is true is\njust to assert that \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\nThis view was advanced by Strawson (1949; 1950), though Strawson also\nargues that there are other important aspects of speech acts involving\n\u2018true\u2019 beyond what is asserted. For instance, they may be\nacts of confirming or granting what someone else said. (Strawson would\nalso object to my making sentences the bearers of truth.)\n\nIn either its speech act or meaning form, the redundancy theory argues\nthere is no property of truth. It is commonly noted that the\nequivalence thesis itself is not enough to sustain the redundancy\ntheory. It merely holds that when truth occurs in the outermost\nposition in a sentence, and the full sentence to which truth is\npredicated is quoted, then truth is eliminable. What happens in other\nenvironments is left to be seen. Modern developments of the redundancy\ntheory include Grover et al. (1975).\n5.2 Minimalist theories\n\nThe equivalence principle looks familiar: it has something like the\nform of the Tarski biconditionals discussed in section 2.2.\nHowever, it is a stronger principle, which identifies the two sides of\nthe biconditional \u2013 either their meanings or the speech acts\nperformed with them. The Tarski biconditionals themselves are simply\nmaterial biconditionals.\n\nA number of deflationary theories look to the Tarski biconditionals\nrather than the full equivalence principle. Their key idea is that\neven if we do not insist on redundancy, we may still hold the\nfollowing theses:\n\nFor a given language \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) and every \\(\\phi\\) in\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\), the biconditionals \\(\\ulcorner \\ulcorner \\phi\n\\urcorner\\) is true if and only if \\(\\phi \\urcorner\\) hold by\ndefinition (or analytically, or trivially, or by stipulation\n\u2026).\nThis is all there is to say about the concept of truth.\n\n\nWe will refer to views which adopt these as minimalist.\nOfficially, this is the name of the view of Horwich (1990), but we\nwill apply it somewhat more widely. (Horwich\u2019s view differs in\nsome specific respects from what is presented here, such as\npredicating truth of propositions, but we believe it is close enough\nto what is sketched here to justify the name.)\n\nThe second thesis, that the Tarski biconditionals are all there is to\nsay about truth, captures something similar to the redundancy\ntheory\u2019s view. It comes near to saying that truth is not a\nproperty at all; to the extent that truth is a property, there is no\nmore to it than the disquotational pattern of the Tarski\nbiconditionals. As Horwich puts it, there is no substantial underlying\nmetaphysics to truth. And as Soames (1984) stresses, certainly nothing\nthat could ground as far-reaching a view as realism or\nanti-realism.\n5.3 Other aspects of deflationism\n\nIf there is no property of truth, or no substantial property of truth,\nwhat role does our term \u2018true\u2019 play? Deflationists\ntypically note that the truth predicate provides us with a convenient\ndevice of disquotation. Such a device allows us to make some\nuseful claims which we could not formulate otherwise, such as the\nblind ascription \u2018The next thing that Bill says will be\ntrue\u2019. (For more on blind ascriptions and their relation to\ndeflationism, see Azzouni, 2001.) A predicate obeying the Tarski\nbiconditionals can also be used to express what would otherwise be\n(potentially) infinite conjunctions or disjunctions, such as the\nnotorious statement of Papal infallibility put \u2018Everything the\nPope says is true\u2019. (Suggestions like this are found in Leeds,\n1978 and Quine, 1970.)\n\nRecognizing these uses for a truth predicate, we might simply think of\nit as introduced into a language by stipulation. The Tarski\nbiconditionals themselves might be stipulated, as the minimalists\nenvisage. One could also construe the clauses of a recursive Tarskian\ntheory as stipulated. (There are some significant logical differences\nbetween these two options. See Halbach (1999) and Ketland (1999) for\ndiscussion.) Other deflationists, such as Beall (2005) or Field\n(1994), might prefer to focus here on rules of inference or rules of\nuse, rather than the Tarski biconditionals themselves.\n\nThere are also important connections between deflationist ideas about\ntruth and certain ideas about meaning. These are fundamental to the\ndeflationism of Field (1986; 1994), which will be discussed in section\n6.3. For an insightful critique of deflationism, see Gupta (1993).\n\nFor more on deflationism, see Azzouni (2018) and the entry on the\n deflationary theory of truth.\n6. Truth and language\n\nOne of the important themes in the literature on truth is its\nconnection to meaning, or more generally, to language. This has proved\nan important application of ideas about truth, and an important issue\nin the study of truth itself. This section will consider a number of\nissues relating truth and language.\n6.1 Truth-bearers\n\nThere have been many debates in the literature over what the primary\nbearers of truth are. Candidates typically include beliefs,\npropositions, sentences, and utterances. We have already seen in\nsection 1 that the classical debates on truth took this issue very\nseriously, and what sort of theory of truth was viable was often seen\nto depend on what the bearers of truth are.\n\nIn spite of the number of options under discussion, and the\nsignificance that has sometimes been placed on the choice, there is an\nimportant similarity between candidate truth-bearers. Consider the\nrole of truth-bearers in the correspondence theory, for instance. We\nhave seen versions of it which take beliefs, propositions, or\ninterpreted sentences to be the primary bearers of truth. But all of\nthem rely upon the idea that their truth-bearers are\nmeaningful, and are thereby able to say something about what\nthe world is like. (We might say that they are able to represent the\nworld, but that is to use \u2018represent\u2019 in a wider sense\nthan we saw in section 3.2. No assumptions about just what stands in\nrelations to what objects are required to see truth-bearers as\nmeaningful.) It is in virtue of being meaningful that truth-bearers\nare able to enter into correspondence relations. Truth-bearers are\nthings which meaningfully make claims about what the world is like,\nand are true or false depending on whether the facts in the world are\nas described.\n\nExactly the same point can be made for the anti-realist theories of\ntruth we saw in section 4.2, though with different accounts of how\ntruth-bearers are meaningful, and what the world contributes. Though\nit is somewhat more delicate, something similar can be said for\ncoherence theories, which usually take beliefs, or whole systems of\nbeliefs, as the primary truth-bearers. Though a coherence theory will\nhardly talk of beliefs representing the facts, it is crucial to the\ncoherence theory that beliefs are contentful beliefs of agents, and\nthat they can enter into coherence relations. Noting the complications\nin interpreting the genuine classical coherence theories, it appears\nfair to note that this requires truth-bearers to be meaningful,\nhowever the background metaphysics (presumably idealism) understands\nmeaning.\n\nThough Tarski works with sentences, the same can be said of his\ntheory. The sentences to which Tarski\u2019s theory applies are fully\ninterpreted, and so also are meaningful. They characterize the world\nas being some way or another, and this in turn determines whether they\nare true or false. Indeed, Tarski needs there to be a fact of the\nmatter about whether each sentence is true or false (abstracting away\nfrom context dependence), to ensure that the Tarski biconditionals do\ntheir job of fixing the extension of \u2018is true\u2019. (But note\nthat just what this fact of the matter consists in is left open by the\nTarskian apparatus.)\n\nWe thus find the usual candidate truth-bearers linked in a tight\ncircle: interpreted sentences, the propositions they express, the\nbelief speakers might hold towards them, and the acts of assertion\nthey might perform with them are all connected by providing something\nmeaningful. This makes them reasonable bearers of truth. For this\nreason, it seems, contemporary debates on truth have been much less\nconcerned with the issue of truth-bearers than were the classical\nones. Some issues remain, of course. Different metaphysical\nassumptions may place primary weight on some particular node in the\ncircle, and some metaphysical views still challenge the existence of\nsome of the nodes. Perhaps more importantly, different views on the\nnature of meaning itself might cast doubt on the coherence of some of\nthe nodes. Notoriously for instance, Quineans (e.g., Quine, 1960) deny\nthe existence of intensional entities, including propositions. Even\nso, it increasingly appears doubtful that attention to truth per\nse will bias us towards one particular primary bearer of\ntruth.\n\nFor more on these issues, see King (2018).\n6.2 Truth and truth conditions\n\nThere is a related, but somewhat different point, which is important\nto understanding the theories we have canvassed.\n\nThe neo-classical theories of truth start with truth-bearers which are\nalready understood to be meaningful, and explain how they get their\ntruth values. But along the way, they often do something more. Take\nthe neo-classical correspondence theory, for instance. This theory, in\neffect, starts with a view of how propositions are meaningful. They\nare so in virtue of having constituents in the world, which are\nbrought together in the right way. There are many complications about\nthe nature of meaning, but at a minimum, this tells us what the truth\nconditions associated with a proposition are. The theory then explains\nhow such truth conditions can lead to the truth value true,\nby the right fact existing.\n\nMany theories of truth are like the neo-classical correspondence\ntheory in being as much theories of how truth-bearers are meaningful\nas of how their truth values are fixed. Again, abstracting from some\ncomplications about meaning, this makes them theories both of truth\nconditions and truth values. The Tarskian theory of\ntruth can be construed this way too. This can be seen both in the way\nthe Tarski biconditionals are understood, and how a recursive theory\nof truth is understood. As we explained Convention T in section 2.2,\nthe primary role of a Tarski biconditional of the form\n\\(\\ulcorner \\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\)\nis true if and only if \\(\\phi \\urcorner\\) is to fix whether\n\\(\\phi\\) is in the extension of \u2018is true\u2019 or not. But it can\nalso be seen as stating the truth conditions of \\(\\phi\\). Both\nrely on the fact that the unquoted occurrence of \\(\\phi\\) is an\noccurrence of an interpreted sentence, which has a truth value, but\nalso provides its truth conditions upon occasions of use.\n\nLikewise, the base clauses of the recursive definition of truth, those\nfor reference and satisfaction, are taken to state the relevant\nsemantic properties of constituents of an interpreted sentence. In\ndiscussing Tarski\u2019s theory of truth in section 2, we focused on\nhow these determine the truth value of a sentence. But they also show\nus the truth conditions of a sentence are determined by these semantic\nproperties. For instance, for a simple sentence like \u2018Snow is\nwhite\u2019, the theory tells us that the sentence is true if the\nreferent of \u2018Snow\u2019 satisfies \u2018white\u2019. This can\nbe understood as telling us that the truth conditions of\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 are those conditions in which the referent\nof \u2018Snow\u2019 satisfies the predicate \u2018is\nwhite\u2019.\n\nAs we saw in sections 3 and 4, the Tarskian apparatus is often seen as\nneeding some kind of supplementation to provide a full theory of\ntruth. A full theory of truth conditions will likewise rest on how the\nTarskian apparatus is put to use. In particular, just what kinds of\nconditions those in which the referent of \u2018snow\u2019 satisfies\nthe predicate \u2018is white\u2019 are will depend on whether we opt\nfor realist or anti-realist theories. The realist option will simply\nlook for the conditions under which the stuff snow bears the property\nof whiteness; the anti-realist option will look to the conditions\nunder which it can be verified, or asserted with warrant, that snow is\nwhite.\n\nThere is a broad family of theories of truth which are theories of\ntruth conditions as well as truth values. This family includes the\ncorrespondence theory in all its forms \u2013 classical and modern.\nYet this family is much wider than the correspondence theory, and\nwider than realist theories of truth more generally. Indeed, virtually\nall the theories of truth that make contributions to the\nrealism/anti-realism debate are theories of truth conditions. In a\nslogan, for many approaches to truth, a theory of truth is a theory of\ntruth conditions.\n6.3 Truth conditions and deflationism\n\nAny theory that provides a substantial account of truth conditions can\noffer a simple account of truth values: a truth-bearer provides truth\nconditions, and it is true if and only if the actual way things are is\namong them. Because of this, any such theory will imply a strong, but\nvery particular, biconditional, close in form to the Tarski\nbiconditionals. It can be made most vivid if we think of propositions\nas sets of truth conditions. Let \\(p\\) be a proposition, i.e., a\nset of truth conditions, and let \\(a\\) be the \u2018actual\nworld\u2019, the condition that actually obtains. Then we can almost\ntrivially see:\n\n\\(p\\) is true if and only if \\(a \\in p\\).\n\n\nThis is presumably necessary. But it is important to observe that it\nis in one respect crucially different from the genuine Tarski\nbiconditionals. It makes no use of a non-quoted sentence, or in fact\nany sentence at all. It does not have the disquotational character of\nthe Tarski biconditionals.\n\nThough this may look like a principle that deflationists should\napplaud, it is not. Rather, it shows that deflationists cannot really\nhold a truth-conditional view of content at all. If they do, then they\ninter alia have a non-deflationary theory of truth, simply by\nlinking truth value to truth conditions through the above\nbiconditional. It is typical of thoroughgoing deflationist theories to\npresent a non-truth-conditional theory of the contents of sentences: a\nnon-truth-conditional account of what makes truth-bearers meaningful.\nWe take it this is what is offered, for instance, by the use\ntheory of propositions in Horwich (1990). It is certainly one of the\nleading ideas of Field (1986; 1994), which explore how a conceptual\nrole account of content would ground a deflationist view of truth.\nOnce one has a non-truth-conditional account of content, it is then\npossible to add a deflationist truth predicate, and use this to give\npurely deflationist statements of truth conditions. But the starting\npoint must be a non-truth-conditional view of what makes truth-bearers\nmeaningful.\n\nBoth deflationists and anti-realists start with something other than\ncorrespondence truth conditions. But whereas an anti-realist will\npropose a different theory of truth conditions, a deflationists will\nstart with an account of content which is not a theory of truth\nconditions at all. The deflationist will then propose that the truth\npredicate, given by the Tarski biconditionals, is an additional\ndevice, not for understanding content, but for disquotation. It is a\nuseful device, as we discussed in section 5.3, but it has nothing to\ndo with content. To a deflationist, the meaningfulness of\ntruth-bearers has nothing to do with truth.\n6.4 Truth and the theory of meaning\n\nIt has been an influential idea, since the seminal work of Davidson\n(e.g., 1967), to see a Tarskian theory of truth as a theory of\nmeaning. At least, as we have seen, a Tarskian theory can be seen as\nshowing how the truth conditions of a sentence are determined by the\nsemantic properties of its parts. More generally, as we see in much of\nthe work of Davidson and of Dummett (e.g., 1959; 1976; 1983; 1991),\ngiving a theory of truth conditions can be understood as a crucial\npart of giving a theory of meaning. Thus, any theory of truth that\nfalls into the broad category of those which are theories of truth\nconditions can be seen as part of a theory of meaning. (For more\ndiscussion of these issues, see Higginbotham (1986; 1989) and the\nexchange between Higginbotham (1992) and Soames (1992).)\n\nA number of commentators on Tarski (e.g., Etchemendy, 1988; Soames,\n1984) have observed that the Tarskian apparatus needs to be understood\nin a particular way to make it suitable for giving a theory of\nmeaning. Tarski\u2019s work is often taken to show how to\ndefine a truth predicate. If it is so used, then whether or\nnot a sentence is true becomes, in essence, a truth of mathematics.\nPresumably what truth conditions sentences of a natural language have\nis a contingent matter, so a truth predicate defined in this way\ncannot be used to give a theory of meaning for them. But the Tarskian\napparatus need not be used just to explicitly define truth. The\nrecursive characterization of truth can be used to state the semantic\nproperties of sentences and their constituents, as a theory of meaning\nshould. In such an application, truth is not taken to be explicitly\ndefined, but rather the truth conditions of sentences are taken to be\ndescribed. (See Heck, 1997 for more discussion.)\n6.5 The coherence theory and meaning\n\nInspired by Quine (e.g., 1960), Davidson himself is well known for\ntaking a different approach to using a theory of truth as a theory of\nmeaning than is implicit in Field (1972). Whereas a Field-inspired\nrepresentational approach is based on a causal account of reference,\nDavidson (e.g., 1973) proposes a process of radical\ninterpretation in which an interpreter builds a Tarskian theory\nto interpret a speaker as holding beliefs which are consistent,\ncoherent, and largely true.\n\nThis led Davidson (e.g. 1986) to argue that most of our beliefs are\ntrue \u2013 a conclusion that squares well with the coherence theory\nof truth. This is a weaker claim than the neo-classical coherence\ntheory would make. It does not insist that all the members of any\ncoherent set of beliefs are true, or that truth simply consists in\nbeing a member of such a coherent set. But all the same, the\nconclusion that most of our beliefs are true, because their contents\nare to be understood through a process of radical interpretation which\nwill make them a coherent and rational system, has a clear affinity\nwith the neo-classical coherence theory.\n\nIn Davidson (1986), he thought his view of truth had enough affinity\nwith the neo-classical coherence theory to warrant being called a\ncoherence theory of truth, while at the same time he saw the role of\nTarskian apparatus as warranting the claim that his view was also\ncompatible with a kind of correspondence theory of truth.\n\nIn later work, however, Davidson reconsidered this position. In fact,\nalready in Davidson (1977) he had expressed doubt about any\nunderstanding of the role of Tarski\u2019s theory in radical\ninterpretation that involves the kind of representational apparatus\nrelied on by Field (1972), as we discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.2. In\nthe \u201cAfterthoughts\u201d to Davidson (1986), he also concluded\nthat his view departs too far from the neo-classical coherence theory\nto be named one. What is important is rather the role of radical\ninterpretation in the theory of content, and its leading to the idea\nthat belief is veridical. These are indeed points connected to\ncoherence, but not to the coherence theory of truth per se. They also\ncomprise a strong form of anti-representationalism. Thus, though he\ndoes not advance a coherence theory of truth, he does advance a theory\nthat stands in opposition to the representational variants of the\ncorrespondence theory we discussed in section 3.2.\n\nFor more on Davidson, see Glanzberg (2013) and the entry on\n Donald Davidson.\n6.6 Truth and assertion\n\nThe relation between truth and meaning is not the only place where\ntruth and language relate closely. Another is the idea, also\nmuch-stressed in the writings of Dummett (e.g., 1959), of the relation\nbetween truth and assertion. Again, it fits into a platitude:\n\nTruth is the aim of assertion.\n\n\nA person making an assertion, the platitude holds, aims to say\nsomething true.\n\nIt is easy to cast this platitude in a way that appears false. Surely,\nmany speakers do not aim to say something true. Any speaker who lies\ndoes not. Any speaker whose aim is to flatter, or to deceive, aims at\nsomething other than truth.\n\nThe motivation for the truth-assertion platitude is rather different.\nIt looks at assertion as a practice, in which certain rules are\nconstitutive. As is often noted, the natural parallel here is\nwith games, like chess or baseball, which are defined by certain\nrules. The platitude holds that it is constitutive of the practice of\nmaking assertions that assertions aim at truth. An assertion by its\nnature presents what it is saying as true, and any assertion which\nfails to be true is ipso facto liable to criticism, whether\nor not the person making the assertion themself wished to have said\nsomething true or to have lied.\n\nDummett\u2019s original discussion of this idea was partially a\ncriticism of deflationism (in particular, of views of Strawson, 1950).\nThe idea that we fully explain the concept of truth by way of the\nTarski biconditionals is challenged by the claim that the\ntruth-assertion platitude is fundamental to truth. As Dummett there\nput it, what is left out by the Tarski biconditionals, and captured by\nthe truth-assertion platitude, is the point of the concept of\ntruth, or what the concept is used for. (For further discussion, see\nGlanzberg, 2003a and Wright, 1992.)\n\nWhether or not assertion has such constitutive rules is, of course,\ncontroversial. But among those who accept that it does, the place of\ntruth in the constitutive rules is itself controversial. The leading\nalternative, defended by Williamson (1996), is that knowledge, not\ntruth, is fundamental to the constitutive rules of assertion.\nWilliamson defends an account of assertion based on the rule that one\nmust assert only what one knows.\n\nFor more on truth and assertion, see the papers in Brown and Cappelen\n(2011) and the entry on\n assertion.",
