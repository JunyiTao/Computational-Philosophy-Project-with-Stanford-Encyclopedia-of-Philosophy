    "main_text": "\n\nImpartiality is sometimes treated by philosophers as if it were\nequivalent to moral impartiality. Or, at the very least, the\nformer word is often used, without the qualifying adjective\n\u2018moral\u2019, even when it is the particularly moral concept\nthat is intended. This is misleading, since impartiality in its\nbroadest sense is best understood as a formal notion, while moral\nimpartiality in particular is a substantive concept \u2013 and one\nconcerning which there is considerable dispute.\n\nThe idea that impartiality is a defining feature of the moral outlook\nraises obvious questions and difficulties in relation to our ordinary\nbeliefs and behaviors. Most of us live in ways that exhibit\nconsiderable partiality toward relatives, friends, and other loved\nones, and to others with whom we are affiliated or associated. The\nexistence of vast global disparities in the distribution of wealth and\naccess to resources may not seem to accord well with the\ncharacteristically modern view that all people are in some fundamental\nsense equal from a moral point of view. Although general and abstract\nmoral principles requiring impartiality tend to strike many of us as\nfairly plausible, our more particular views and practices often seem\nto place considerably less significance on it.\n\nThough we will begin by addressing the broader, formal concept, and\nend with a brief discussion of issues raised by particularly\nepistemic impartiality, this entry will be predominantly\nconcerned with moral impartiality; the sort of impartiality, that is,\nthat commonly features in normative moral and political theories.\n",
