    "main_text": "Relation to Other Scholars\n2. Relation to Other Scholars\n\nCrathorn\u2019s Sentences commentary is of great\nphilosophical and historical interest for the study of the first\ngeneration of Oxford thinkers after Ockham because he develops his own\nprovocative positions by discussing the major issues of his day and\ncriticizing the views of his contemporaries (Courtenay 1978, Gelber\n2004). His favorite target was Ockham, but he also argued against the\nviews of Thomas Aquinas (Krauss 1933), John Duns Scotus, Richard\nFitzralph, and Robert Holkot (Schepers 1970, 1972).\n\nAlthough Crathorn criticized Ockham, he remained a nominalist (he\nadmits only individuals in his ontology and subscribes to the same\nkind of theory of predication as Ockham). Above all, he worked out\nsome of the consequences of Ockham\u2019s views in epistemology, the\nphilosophy of language, and ontology, to show what problems they\ncreated. We do not know whether he knew Ockham personally, or only\nindirectly, through his younger disciple, Adam Wodeham. Indeed,\nWodeham frequently refers to a Dominican socius, who could\nhave been Crathorn himself or a certain John Grafton, another Oxford\nDominican of this time.\n",
