    "main_text": "Quantifier Accounts of Ontological Commitment || Relata of Ontological Commitment\n1.2 Relata of Ontological Commitment\nOntological commitment, on its face, is a relation between theories\nand entities, or kinds of entity. Before attempting to explicate and\nevaluate Quine's criterion of ontological commitment, it is important\nto specify more carefully the relata. A theory, for\nQuine, is just a set of sentences (or a single sentence) of some\nlanguage. But what language? Strictly speaking, Quine's criterion is\nonly to be applied to theories couched within the following\nespecially austere form of first-order predicate logic: there are\nfirst-order existential and universal quantifiers but no other\nvariable-binding operators; there are predicates, including identity,\nbut no function symbols or individual constants. Thus, all names and\ndefinite descriptions have been eliminated from the language;\nreference rests entirely with the variables. The elimination of\nsingular terms serves both to simplify the criterion and to avoid\nage-old confusions. Unlike bound variables, singular terms sometimes\ndo and sometimes do not carry ontological commitment: \u2018Socrates\nis wise\u2019 presumably does; but \u2018Pegasus does not\nexist\u2019 presumably does not. Whenever singular terms do carry\nontological commitment, it will be reflected in the assignment to the\nvariables of the regimented theory. Thus, whenever a sentence\ncontaining a definite description is ontologically committed to some\nentity satisfying the description, so will be the regimented sentence\nthat results from applying Russell's theory of descriptions (which\nwas endorsed by Quine). Whenever a sentence containing a name is\nontologically committed to some entity denoted by the name, so will\nbe a regimented sentence that contains a predicate applying\nexclusively to that entity. For example, if instead of using the name\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 we use a predicate \u2018Is-Socrates\u2019\ninterpreted to mean is-identical-with-Socrates (sometimes\nabbreviated \u2018Socratizes\u2019), the ontological commitment\nincurred by the name is transferred without loss to the bound\nvariable in \u2018\u2203x\nIs\u2011Socrates(x)\u2019 (or \u2018\u2203x\nSocratizes(x)\u2019).[3] \nUnless noted otherwise, \u2018theory\u2019 will always mean\n\u2018interpreted theory\u2019; uninterpreted theories say nothing\nand have no ontological commitments. When the theory is couched within\nfirst-order logic, the interpretation is given by standard Tarskian\nsemantics. In particular, each monadic predicate of the language of\nthe theory has been assigned a class as its interpretation;\neach n-ary predicate has been assigned a class\nof n-tuples; the quantifiers are interpreted objectually by\nway of assignments to the variables. On the other hand, it is not\nsupposed that the domain of the quantifiers has been fixed once and\nfor all. Sometimes, in applying the criteria, alternative domains are\nconsidered, and the theory is evaluated for truth under the various\nalternatives.\nThe restriction to theories couched within first-order predicate\nlogic is severe. Philosophers have been no less interested in the\nontological commitments of theories couched within other logical\nframeworks, such as higher-order or intensional logics\n(see \u00a71.7.2\nand \u00a71.7.3). Worse, if the criterion is to\nhave application to the actual ontological debates among philosophers,\nit will have to apply to theories couched within ordinary language as\nwell. This led Quine\u2014at least sometimes\u2014to endorse\nan extended criterion of ontological commitment: a theory is\nontologically committed to an entity or kind of entity if and only if\nevery acceptable paraphrase of the theory into (austere) first-order\npredicate logic is ontologically committed to that entity or kind of\nentity. This provides philosophers with a method for avoiding\nontological commitment: find an acceptable paraphrase of the theory\ninto first-order predicate logic that is not ontologically\ncommitted to the questionable entities (Quine 1948: 32, 1953:\n103\u2013104). (What counts as an \u201cacceptable\nparaphrase\u201d, and whether any sort of \u201cparaphrase\u201d\nshould be required, is discussed\nin \u00a74.2.)\nWhat about the second relatum? What is it that theories\nare committed to? Sometimes we say that a theory is committed to a\nparticular entity. For example, we say that the sentence\n\u2018Socrates exists\u2019 (or, in our austere language,\n\u2018\u2203x Socratizes(x)\u2019) is committed\nto Socrates. But more often we speak of ontological commitment to some\nentities in the plural, or to some kind of entity.  For\nexample, we speak of theories being committed to universals, or\nnumbers, or electrons. But ontological commitment to some entities\nplurally, or some kind of entity, is clearly not the same as\nontological commitment to each of the entities singly. Consider a\ntheory that contains \u2018\u2203x\nElephant(x)\u2019. It is ontologically committed to\nelephants, or to the kind elephant, but not to any particular\nelephant: no particular elephant need be the value of the variable\n\u2018x\u2019 in order for the sentence to be true. A\ntheory is committed to Ks, or a kind K, just in case\nthe values of the variables must include at least\none K in order for the theory to be true, in which case\nthe existence of Ks is in some sense entailed by the\ntheory. (More on different relevant senses of entailment\nin \u00a71.5\nand \u00a72 below.) \nBut there is a problem (Cartwright 1954; Scheffler and Chomsky\n1958; Jackson 1989; Michael 2008). Suppose first that ontological\ncommitment takes a plural argument in its second place, that a\ncommitment to Ks is a relation to the Ks\nthemselves. Then, on plausible assumptions, the meta-ontologist\ncannot assert that a theory is ontologically committed to Ks\nwithout being committed to Ks herself; for the\nmeta-ontologist's own domain of quantification must include at least\none K in order for \u2018T is ontologically\ncommitted to Ks\u2019 to be true. And that is wrong.\nSuppose instead, then, that ontological commitment is a relation, not\nto the Ks, but to the kind K. If a kind K\ncan exist without Ks existing, this may help. But, on\nplausible assumptions, it still has the untoward consequence that the\nmeta-ontologist cannot herself assert that a theory is ontologically\ncommitted to a kind K without being committed\nto kinds. And, whether kinds are construed as properties, or\nsets of possibilia, or taken to be sui generis,\nthat still seems wrong. This suggests that the logical form of\nstatements attributing ontological commitment is misleading, and that\nontological commitment is not a genuine relation at all; only then\nwill meta-ontological claims about ontological commitment themselves\nbe ontologically neutral, or as ontologically neutral as\npossible.[4] In\nthis article, the locutions \u2018ontological commitment\nto Ks\u2019 and \u2018ontological commitment to the\nkind K\u2019 will be used without presupposing that\nontological commitment is a relation to the Ks plurally, or\nto the kind K, or, indeed, that it is a relation at all. The\ndifferent accounts of ontological commitment will treat the matter\ndifferently.\nFinally, it will be useful in what follows to interpret\n\u2018K\u2019 and \u2018kind\u2019 broadly. So, for\nexample, not-being-an-electron is a kind,\nand being-an-electron-or-a-chair is a kind, and so is being\none of some random collection of entities. We may not be interested in\nasking whether a theory is ontologically committed to negative, or\ndisjunctive, or gerrymandered kinds; but it is harmless to allow the\ncriterion to supply answers. Moreover, this allows us to assimilate\nontological commitment to single entities to ontological commitment to\nkinds of entity: to be ontologically committed to a single\nentity, a, is just to be ontologically committed to the\nkind, is-identical-with-a.\n",
