    "main_text": "Logicism and Structuralism\n3. Logicism and Structuralism\n\nSo far we have focused on Dedekind\u2019s contributions in his overtly\nfoundational writings. We reviewed his innovative approaches to the\nnatural and real numbers; we also reconsidered his role in the rise of\nmodern set theory. Along the way, some philosophical issues have come\nup. A more extended reflection on them seems called for, however,\nespecially concerning Dedekind\u2019s \n\u201clogicism\u201d and\n\u201cstructuralism\u201d \n(both topics that have led to some controversies in the\nsecondary literature, as already indicated parenthetically).\n\nLike for Frege, the other main logicist in the nineteenth century,\n\u201clogic\u201d is \nmore encompassing for Dedekind than often\nassumed today (as comprising only first-order logic). Both thinkers\ntake the notions of object, set, and function to be fundamental for\nhuman thought and, as such, to fall within the range of logic. Each of\nthem then develops a version of set theory (a theory of\n\u201csystems\u201d, \u201cextensions\u201d, or\n\u201cclasses\u201d) \nseen as part of logic. Also for both, logic in\nthis encompassing sense is independent of intuitive considerations\nand, specifically, of traditional Euclidean geometry (understood to be \ngrounded in pure or empirical intuition). A main goal in reducing\nanalysis and arithmetic to logic is, thus, to establish that those\nfields too are independent of intuition (cf. Demopoulos & \nClark 2005).\n\nThe view that analysis is not dependent on geometry, since it falls\nwithin the realm of arithmetical and basic logical thought, was not\nentirely new at the time\u2014Gauss and Dirichlet already held such a\nview, as mentioned above (cf. also Ferreir\u00f3s 2007). What\nFrege\u2019s and Dedekind\u2019s new contributions consisted in were original,\ndetailed reductions of, on the one hand, analysis to arithmetic and,\non the other hand, arithmetic to logic. Moreover, each of them\ncomplemented these reductions with systematic elaborations of logic.\nAs Dedekind\u2019s work was better known than Frege\u2019s at the time, probably\nbecause of his greater reputation as a mathematician, he was seen as\nthe main representative of \n\u201clogicism\u201d \nby interested contemporaries, such as C.S. Pierce, Ernst \nSchr\u00f6der, and David Hilbert (cf. \nFerreir\u00f3s 1999, ch. 7, \nFerreir\u00f3s 2009).\n\nIn addition to these general commonalities in Dedekind\u2019s and Frege\u2019s\nversions of logicism, the two thinkers also agreed on a methodological\nprinciple encapsulated in the following remark by Dedekind: In\nscience, and especially in mathematics, \u201cnothing capable of\nproof ought to be accepted without proof\u201d (Dedekind 1888a,\npreface). This principle ought to be adhered to not so much because it\nincreases certainty. Rather, it is often only by providing an\nexplicit, detailed proof for a result that the assumptions on which it\ndepends become evident and, thus, its range of applicability\nestablished. Both Frege and Dedekind had learned that lesson from the\nhistory of mathematics, especially developments in geometry, algebra,\nand the calculus (see Reck 2013, building on Wilson 1992,\n2010, Tappenden 1995, 2006, Ferreir\u00f3s 1999, and Detlefen\n2011).\n\nBesides where they are in agreement, it is instructive to consider\nsome of the differences between Dedekind and Frege too. First and put\nin modern terminology, a major difference is that, while Frege\u2019s main\ncontributions to logic concern syntactic, proof-theoretic aspects,\nDedekind tends to focus on semantic, model-theoretic aspects. Thus,\nnothing like Frege\u2019s revolutionary analysis of deductive inference, by\nmeans of his \u201cBegriffsschrift\u201d, \ncan be found in Dedekind\u2019s\nworks. Dedekind, in turn, is much more explicit and clear than Frege\nabout issues such as categoricity, completeness, independence, etc. \nThis allows, among others, to\nsee him as a precursor of the \u201cformal \naxiomatic\u201d approach\nchampioned later by Hilbert and Bernays (Hallett 1994, 1995, Sieg\n& Schlimm 2005, 2014, Sieg 2010, 2014).\n\nCompared to Frege, Dedekind also has much more to say about the\ninfinite, not just by formulating a definition of that notion, but\nalso by exploring the possibility of different infinite cardinalities\nwith Cantor. And he shows more awareness of the challenge posed by\nKroneckerian computational and constructivist strictures to logicism.\nThe differences between Frege\u2019s and Dedekind\u2019s respective treatments\nof the natural and real numbers are noteworthy too. As we saw,\nDedekind conceives of the natural numbers primarily as ordinal\nnumbers; he also identifies them purely \n\u201cstructurally\u201d.\nFrege makes their application as cardinal numbers central; and he\ninsists on building this application into the very nature of the\nnatural numbers, thus endowing them with non-structural,\n\u201cintrinsic\u201d properties. \nThe case of the real numbers\nillustrates this divergence further. Finally, Frege\u2019s and Dedekind\u2019s\nunderlying conceptions of logic and language differ significantly. \n(The latter is one of the main reasons for why Dedekind is not \ninterpreted as a logicist in Sinaceur 2008, 2015,\n2017.)\n\nApart from Frege, it is illuminating to compare Dedekind\u2019s approach\nmore with later set-theoretic ones. We noted in the last section that\nmany of his innovations have been built into axiomatic set theory. Yet\nhere too, several differences emerge if one looks more closely. To\nbegin with, Dedekind does not start with an axiom of infinity as a\nfundamental principle; instead, he tries to prove the existence of\ninfinite sets. This can be seen as another application of the\nmethodological rule to prove everything \u201ccapable of\nproof\u201d, as well as a crucial aspect of his logicism. \nHowever, few set theorists today will want to go back to this aspect of Dedekind\u2019s\napproach. (Dedekind\u2019s argument in this connection is similar to an\nearlier one in Bolzano\u2019s posthumously published work; cf.\nFerreir\u00f3s 1999, ch. 7, Klev 2019.) \n\nA second marked difference between Dedekind and current set theory has\nalready come up too, but deserves further comment. This is his appeal\nto \u201cabstraction\u201d, and \n\u201ccreation\u201d,\nin the last step of his introduction of both the natural and the real\nnumbers (\u201cDedekind-abstraction\u201d, \nas it is called in Tait 1996). For the real numbers, the\nstandard procedure in axiomatic set theory is to follow Dedekind up to\nthis last step, but then to work with the Dedekind-cuts themselves as\n\u201cthe real numbers\u201d. \nWhile aware of this option (Dedekind 1876b, 1888b), Dedekind tells us to \napply \u201cabstraction\u201d to\nthe cuts insofar as they consist of complex sets, thus to\n\u201ccreate\u201d additional \nmathematical objects determined by\nbut not identical with them. Likewise, in the case of the natural\nnumbers it is standard today to construct a particular simple\ninfinity, usually the set of finite von Neumann ordinals, and then to\nidentify the natural numbers with them (thus: \\(0 = \\emptyset\\), \\(1 =\n\\{0\\}\\), \\(2 = \\{0, 1\\}\\), etc.). Once again, the step involving\n\u201cabstraction\u201d and \u201ccreation\u201d of Dedekind\u2019s\nprocedure is avoided by such identification.\n\nIn current approaches it is sometimes added that any other\nset-theoretically constructed system that is isomorphic to the system\nof Dedekind cuts or to the system of finite von Neumann ordinals,\nrespectively, would do as well, i.e. be usable mathematically as\n\u201cthe real numbers\u201d or \u201cthe natural numbers\u201d\nfor most practical purposes. This means that contemporary set theory\nis, often implicitly and without further elaboration, supplemented by\na \u201cset-theoretic structuralist\u201d \nview about the nature of\nmathematical objects (Reck & Price 2000). The resulting\nphilosophical position is different from Dedekind\u2019s. (But see again\nSieg & Morris 2018; in it Dedekind is interpreted as \nchanging his position over time, i.e., as having adopted a position close to\nset-theoretic structuralism by 1888.) Nor does Dedekind\u2019s position\ncoincide with several other forms of structuralism prominent in\ncontemporary philosophy of mathematics, e.g., those defended by\nGeoffrey Hellman, Michael Resnik, and Stewart Shapiro.\n\nWhy do most mathematicians and philosophers not follow Dedekind more\nclosely in this respect? Here the following difficulties play a role\n(cf. Boolos 1990, M\u00fcller-Stach 2017, among others): How exactly\nshould his notions of \u201cabstraction\u201d and\n\u201ccreation\u201d be understood, if they can be made sense of at\nall? And why did Dedekind insist on their use in the first place,\nsince we seem to be able to do without them as axiomatic set theory\nshows? A partial answer to the latter question is: For Dedekind, the\nreal numbers should not be identified with the corresponding cuts\nbecause those cuts have \u201cwrong properties\u201d; namely, as\nsets they contain elements, something that seems \u201cforeign\u201d\nto the real numbers themselves. Similarly, the natural numbers should\nnot be ascribed set-theoretic or other \u201cforeign\u201d\nproperties; they too should be conceived of \u201cpurely\narithmetically\u201d (see again Dedekind 1876b, 1888b). Can anything\nfurther be said in this connection?\n\nBy philosophical critics, Dedekind\u2019s procedure is often interpreted as\nfollows: As his language of \u201cabstraction\u201d \nand \u201ccreation\u201d \nsuggests, he is appealing to psychological\nprocesses. And the resulting entities\u2014\u201cthe real\nnumber\u201d and \u201cthe natural numbers\u201d\u2014must then be\npsychological or mental entities (existing in people\u2019s subjective\nconsciousness). If that was correct, his position would amount to a form of\npsychologism about mathematics that is deeply problematic, as Frege,\nHusserl, and others have taught us (cf. Dummett 1995). Partly to avoid\nsuch a damning conclusion, partly to attribute more philosophical\ndepth to Dedekind, the following reply can be found in the literature:\nWhile he does not say so explicitly, Dedekind\u2019s\npsychologistic-sounding language indicates a commitment to Kantian\nassumptions, in particular to Kant\u2019s transcendental psychology\n(Kitcher 1986, McCarty 1995, Klev 2019, cf. also Benis-Sinaceur 2008,\n2015, 2018, Floyd 2013). Then again, it is not clear that this takes\ncare of the psychologism charge fully (often also directed against\nKant), so that such a response would have to be spelled out further\n(cf. Yap 2017, Reck 2020, building on Cassirer 1907,\n1910). In itself, it also leaves unexplained the precise form of\nDedekind\u2019s \u201cabstraction\u201d.\n\nRecently another suggestion for how to get clearer about the nature of\n\u201cDedekind abstraction\u201d \nand, at the same time, avoid crude\nforms of psychologism has become prominent. Namely, instead of taking\nsuch abstraction to amount to a psychological process, it should be\nunderstood as a logical procedure (cf. Tait 1996, earlier Cassirer 1910). \nConsider again the case of the natural\nnumbers, where Dedekind is most explicit about this issue. What we are\nprovided with by him is this: First, the language and logic to be used\nare specified, thus the kinds of assertions and arguments that can be\nmade concerning the natural numbers; second, a particular simple\ninfinity is constructed; third, this simple infinity is used to\ndetermine the truth values of all arithmetic sentences (by equating\nthem with the truth values of corresponding sentences for the given\nsimple infinity); and fourth, this determination is justified by\nshowing that all simple infinities are isomorphic (so that, if a\nsentence holds for one of them, it holds for all).\n\nThe core of the procedure just described is the following: Something\nis true for the natural numbers exactly when the corresponding\nstatement holds for all simple infinities (i.e., is a semantic\nconsequence of the Dedekind-Peano axioms). What, then, are the natural\nnumbers? They are those mathematical objects whose properties are\ndetermined by all arithmetic truths; we \u201cabstract\naway\u201d from everything else in terms of a logical procedure.\nMoreover, this procedure can be spelled out, precisely and consistently, in terms of\n\u201cstructural abstraction principles\u201d \n(cf. Linnebo &\nPettigrew 2014, Reck 2018 for details). Along such lines, all that\nmatters about mathematical objects, indeed all that is built into\ntheir identity and nature, is what the corresponding mathematical\ntruths determine. Consequently, it is by specifying those truths that\nwe \u201ccreate\u201d, or better \nfully characterize, them. The\nresulting position seems clearly not psychologistic, and it might be\ncalled \u201clogical \nstructuralism\u201d (Reck 2003, Yap 2009a).\n\nInterpreted as such, Dedekind\u2019s approach is related to that of the\n\u201cAmerican Postulate Theorists\u201d, \nE. Huntington, O. Veblen,\netc. (cf. Awodey & Reck 2002).\nThere is also a close connection to, and a clear influence on, the\nformal axiomatics developed by Hilbert and Bernays later (cf. Sieg\n2010, 2014, also Hallett 1994, 1995, 2003). For all of these thinkers,\nwhat is crucial in, and sufficient for, mathematics is that the\ncompleteness and consistency of certain basic concepts, or of the\ncorresponding systems of axioms, are established. In Dedekind\u2019s case,\ncompleteness is to be understood in a semantic sense, as based on\ncategoricity; likewise, consistency is to be understood semantically,\nas satisfiability (Dedekind 1890); and both are tied to his distinctive\ncombination of logicism and structuralism.\n\nThe syntactic study of such issues, especially of consistency, that\nbecame a core part of Hilbertian \u201cproof theory\u201d is not\npresent in Dedekind\u2019s work. As already noted, the proof-theoretic side\nof logic is not pursued much by him. Nor is the \u201cfinitism\u201d\ncharacteristic of Hilbert & Bernays\u2019 later work present in\nDedekind (an aspect developed in response to the set-theoretic\nantinomies and to intuitionist challenges), especially if it is\nunderstood in a metaphysical sense. Such finitism might have been\nacceptable to Dedekind as a methodological stance, but in other\nrespects his position is strongly infinitary. In fact, the finite is\nexplained in terms of the infinite in his work: the notion of finitude\nby that of infinity, the natural numbers in terms of infinite sets,\netc. (cf. Hilbert 1922).\n\nThe summary of Dedekind\u2019s position in this section highlighted logical\nissues (his basic logical notions and procedures, compared both to\nFrege and to axiomatic set theory) and metaphysical issues\n(Dedekindian abstraction and creation, the structural nature of\nmathematical objects). However, there is another dimension of his\nposition\u2014another sense in which Dedekind\u2019s approach represents a\nunique combination of logicism and structuralism\u2014that deserves\nphilosophical attention. That side involves primarily methodological\nand epistemological aspects. Some of those aspects already played a\nrole in our discussions of his overtly foundational writings; but in\norder to shed more light on them, it helps to turn to his other\nmathematical work, starting with algebraic number theory.\n",
