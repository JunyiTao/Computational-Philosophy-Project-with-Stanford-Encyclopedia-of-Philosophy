    "main_text": "God\n3. God\n\n\nOne of Descartes' first metaphysical first principles that he\nproves is the existence and nature (as benevolent) of God. His primary\nreason for this is to call upon a benevolent God as a guarantor of the\ntruth of his clear and distinct ideas. Immediately after her\ndiscussion of her first principles of knowledge, Du Ch\u00e2telet\nalso turns to metaphysical first principles that can be derived from\nthe epistemology, and she too turns to a proof for the existence and\nnature of God. But her reasons for doing so are different from\nDescartes' immediate reasons as just articulated. For Du\nCh\u00e2telet, as Marcy Lascano has rightly argued, \u201cwanted to\nprovide a ground for physics that would explain the rational basis of\nthe workings of the universe. Proving that an eternal, good and\nrational being created the universe would provide such a ground\u201d\n(Lascano 2011, 743). In Du Ch\u00e2telet's words, \u201c[t]he study\nof nature elevates us to the knowledge of the supreme being; this\ngreat truth is even more necessary, if possible, to good physics than\nto morality, and it ought to be the foundation and conclusion of all\nthe research we make in this science\u201d (IP \u00a718, p. 138). As\nshown above, Du Ch\u00e2telet believes in the interconnectedness and\nsystematicity of the natural world as a whole, and she believes that\nthis is a crucial general reason why God has chosen to actualize this\nworld. And so, it seems humans do have cognitive access to\nthis sufficient reason for why God chose this world as opposed to any\nother world. In fact, Du Ch\u00e2telet links the interconnectedness\nand systematicity of the natural world as a whole with perfection\n(\u00a726), thus indicating that God's sufficient reason for his\nchoice of this world over any other possible worlds in a further\nprinciple, namely, the Principle of the Best. Du Ch\u00e2telet's\nbelief in the interconnectedness and systematicity of the natural\nworld as a whole is the key to her method and physics, even though\n(as shown below) there are limits to the role that can be played in\nphysics by these metaphysical features of the world. Nonetheless,\nestablishing the existence of God as one who would choose to actualize\nsuch a world is Du Ch\u00e2telet's next crucial step.\n\n\nWe shall not go into the details of her argument for the existence and\nnature of God (see Lascano 2011). We simply note here that hers is a\ncosmological argument for the existence of God, specifically one\nstarting from the existence in the world of contingent beings. Thus,\nher distinction between necessity and contingency as developed in her\nmaterial on the PC and the PSR, together with further use of the PSR\nin her chapter on God, lead to her particular proof for God's\nexistence.  She argues:\n All that exists has a sufficient reason for its\nexistence. The sufficient reason for the existence of a being must be\nwithin it, or outside it. Now the reason for the existence of a\ncontingent being cannot be within it, for if it carried the sufficient\nreason for its own existence, it would be impossible for it not to\nexist, which is contradictory to the definition of a contingent\nbeing. So the sufficient reason for the existence of a contingent\nbeing must necessarily be outside it\u2026. This sufficient reason\ncannot be found in another contingent being, nor in a succession of\nsuch beings, since the same question will always arise at the end of\nthis chain, however it may be extended. So it must come from a\nnecessary Being that contains the sufficient reason for the existence\nof all contingent beings, and for his own existence, and this being is\nGod. (IP \u00a719.5\u20136, p. 139, translation altered)\n\n\nLascano has noted the influence of both Leibniz and Locke on Du\nCh\u00e2telet's cosmological proof (Lascano 2011,\npassim). She also notes that Du Ch\u00e2telet makes a similar\nmistake to one Aquinas makes in his Five Ways, in assuming that an\ninfinite chain of causes cannot simply extend into the past with no\nneed of a supermundane cause (Lascano 2011, 756). It is a shame that Du\nCh\u00e2telet's acquaintance with the ideas of Samuel Clarke\n(Hutton 2012) did not extend as far as his cosmological proof from\ncontingency to necessity for the existence of God, for if it had, then\nperhaps she would have sidestepped this error. Nonetheless, again as\nLascano points out, her proof is a notable improvement on\nLocke's, and the key point to be drawn from her discussion of\nGod is that articulated above, namely the importance to Du\nCh\u00e2telet's scientific endeavors of God and the nature of\nthe world he creates.\n",
