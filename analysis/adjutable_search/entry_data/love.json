    "main_text": "\n\n1. Preliminary Distinctions\n\nIn ordinary conversations, we often say things like the following:\n\nI love chocolate (or skiing).\nI love doing philosophy (or being a father).\nI love my dog (or cat).\nI love my wife (or mother or child or friend).\n\n\nHowever, what is meant by \u2018love\u2019 differs from case to\ncase. (1) may be understood as meaning merely that I like this thing\nor activity very much. In (2) the implication is typically that I find\nengaging in a certain activity or being a certain kind of person to be\na part of my identity and so what makes my life worth living; I might\njust as well say that I value these. By contrast, (3) and (4)\nseem to indicate a mode of concern that cannot be neatly assimilated\nto anything else. Thus, we might understand the sort of love at issue\nin (4) to be, roughly, a matter of caring about another person as the\nperson she is, for her own sake. (Accordingly, (3) may be understood\nas a kind of deficient mode of the sort of love we typically reserve\nfor persons.) Philosophical accounts of love have focused primarily on\nthe sort of personal love at issue in (4); such personal love\nwill be the focus here (though see Frankfurt (1999) and Jaworska &\nWonderly (2017) for attempts to provide a more general account that\napplies to non-persons as well).\n\nEven within personal love, philosophers from the ancient Greeks on\nhave traditionally distinguished three notions that can properly be\ncalled \u201clove\u201d: eros, agape, and\nphilia. It will be useful to distinguish these three and say\nsomething about how contemporary discussions typically blur these\ndistinctions (sometimes intentionally so) or use them for other\npurposes.\n\n\u2018Eros\u2019 originally meant love in the sense of a\nkind of passionate desire for an object, typically sexual passion\n(Liddell et al., 1940). Nygren (1953a,b) describes eros as\nthe \u201c\u2018love of desire,\u2019 or acquisitive love\u201d\nand therefore as egocentric (1953b, p. 89). Soble (1989b, 1990)\nsimilarly describes eros as \u201cselfish\u201d and as a\nresponse to the merits of the beloved\u2014especially the\nbeloved\u2019s goodness or beauty. What is evident in Soble\u2019s\ndescription of eros is a shift away from the sexual: to love\nsomething in the \u201cerosic\u201d sense (to use the term Soble\ncoins) is to love it in a way that, by being responsive to its merits,\nis dependent on reasons. Such an understanding of eros is\nencouraged by Plato\u2019s discussion in the Symposium, in\nwhich Socrates understands sexual desire to be a deficient response to\nphysical beauty in particular, a response which ought to be developed\ninto a response to the beauty of a person\u2019s soul and,\nultimately, into a response to the form, Beauty.\n\nSoble\u2019s intent in understanding eros to be a\nreason-dependent sort of love is to articulate a sharp contrast with\nagape, a sort of love that does not respond to the value of\nits object. \u2018Agape\u2019 has come, primarily through\nthe Christian tradition, to mean the sort of love God has for us\npersons, as well as our love for God and, by extension, of our love\nfor each other\u2014a kind of brotherly love. In the paradigm case of\nGod\u2019s love for us, agape is \u201cspontaneous and\nunmotivated,\u201d revealing not that we merit that love but that\nGod\u2019s nature is love (Nygren 1953b, p. 85). Rather than\nresponding to antecedent value in its object, agape instead\nis supposed to create value in its object and therefore to\ninitiate our fellowship with God (pp. 87\u201388). Consequently,\nBadhwar (2003, p. 58) characterizes agape as\n\u201cindependent of the loved individual\u2019s fundamental\ncharacteristics as the particular person she is\u201d; and Soble\n(1990, p. 5) infers that agape, in contrast to eros,\nis therefore not reason dependent but is rationally\n\u201cincomprehensible,\u201d admitting at best of causal or\nhistorical\n explanations.[1]\n\nFinally, \u2018philia\u2019 originally meant a kind of\naffectionate regard or friendly feeling towards not just one\u2019s\nfriends but also possibly towards family members, business partners,\nand one\u2019s country at large (Liddell et al., 1940; Cooper, 1977).\nLike eros, philia is generally (but not universally)\nunderstood to be responsive to (good) qualities in one\u2019s\nbeloved. This similarity between eros and philia has\nled Thomas (1987) to wonder whether the only difference between\nromantic love and friendship is the sexual involvement of the\nformer\u2014and whether that is adequate to account for the real\ndifferences we experience. The distinction between eros and\nphilia becomes harder to draw with Soble\u2019s attempt to\ndiminish the importance of the sexual in eros (1990).\n\nMaintaining the distinctions among eros, agape, and\nphilia becomes even more difficult when faced with\ncontemporary theories of love (including romantic love) and\nfriendship. For, as discussed below, some theories of romantic love\nunderstand it along the lines of the agape tradition as\ncreating value in the beloved (cf.\n Section 4.2),\n and other accounts of romantic love treat sexual activity as merely\nthe expression of what otherwise looks very much like friendship.\n\nGiven the focus here on personal love, Christian conceptions\nof God\u2019s love for persons (and vice versa) will be\nomitted, and the distinction between eros and philia\nwill be blurred\u2014as it typically is in contemporary accounts.\nInstead, the focus here will be on these contemporary understandings\nof love, including romantic love, understood as an attitude\nwe take towards other\n persons.[2]\n\nIn providing an account of love, philosophical analyses must be\ncareful to distinguish love from other positive attitudes we take\ntowards persons, such as liking. Intuitively, love differs from such\nattitudes as liking in terms of its \u201cdepth,\u201d and the\nproblem is to elucidate the kind of \u201cdepth\u201d we intuitively\nfind love to have. Some analyses do this in part by providing thin\nconceptions of what liking amounts to. Thus, Singer (1991) and Brown\n(1987) understand liking to be a matter of desiring, an attitude that\nat best involves its object having only instrumental (and not\nintrinsic) value. Yet this seems inadequate: surely there are\nattitudes towards persons intermediate between having a desire with a\nperson as its object and loving the person. I can care about a person\nfor her own sake and not merely instrumentally, and yet such caring\ndoes not on its own amount to (non-deficiently) loving her, for it\nseems I can care about my dog in exactly the same way, a kind of\ncaring which is insufficiently personal for love.\n\nIt is more common to distinguish loving from liking via the intuition\nthat the \u201cdepth\u201d of love is to be explained in terms of a\nnotion of identification: to love someone is somehow to\nidentify yourself with him, whereas no such notion of\nidentification is involved in liking. As Nussbaum puts it, \u201cThe\nchoice between one potential love and another can feel, and be, like a\nchoice of a way of life, a decision to dedicate oneself to these\nvalues rather than these\u201d (1990, p. 328); liking clearly does\nnot have this sort of \u201cdepth\u201d (see also Helm 2010; Bagley\n2015). Whether love involves some kind of identification, and if so\nexactly how to understand such identification, is a central bone of\ncontention among the various analyses of love. In particular, Whiting\n(2013) argues that the appeal to a notion of identification distorts\nour understanding of the sort of motivation love can provide, for\ntaken literally it implies that love motivates through\nself-interest rather than through the\nbeloved\u2019s interests. Thus, Whiting argues, central to\nlove is the possibility that love takes the lover \u201coutside\nherself\u201d, potentially forgetting herself in being moved directly\nby the interests of the beloved. (Of course, we need not take the\nnotion of identification literally in this way: in identifying with\none\u2019s beloved, one might have a concern for one\u2019s beloved\nthat is analogous to one\u2019s concern for oneself; see\nHelm 2010.)\n\nAnother common way to distinguish love from other personal attitudes\nis in terms of a distinctive kind of evaluation, which itself can\naccount for love\u2019s \u201cdepth.\u201d Again, whether love\nessentially involves a distinctive kind of evaluation, and if so how\nto make sense of that evaluation, is hotly disputed. Closely related\nto questions of evaluation are questions of justification: can we\njustify loving or continuing to love a particular person, and if so,\nhow? For those who think the justification of love is possible, it is\ncommon to understand such justification in terms of evaluation, and\nthe answers here affect various accounts\u2019 attempts to make sense\nof the kind of constancy or commitment love seems to involve, as well\nas the sense in which love is directed at particular individuals.\n\nIn what follows, theories of love are tentatively and hesitantly\nclassified into four types: love as union, love as robust concern,\nlove as valuing, and love as an emotion. It should be clear, however,\nthat particular theories classified under one type sometimes also\ninclude, without contradiction, ideas central to other types. The\ntypes identified here overlap to some extent, and in some cases\nclassifying particular theories may involve excessive pigeonholing.\n(Such cases are noted below.) Part of the classificatory problem is\nthat many accounts of love are quasi-reductionistic, understanding\nlove in terms of notions like affection, evaluation, attachment, etc.,\nwhich themselves never get analyzed. Even when these accounts eschew\nexplicitly reductionistic language, very often little attempt is made\nto show how one such \u201caspect\u201d of love is conceptually\nconnected to others. As a result, there is no clear and obvious way to\nclassify particular theories, let alone identify what the relevant\nclasses should be.\n2. Love as Union\n\nThe\n union view claims that love consists in the formation of (or the\ndesire to form) some significant kind of union, a \u201cwe.\u201d A\ncentral task for union theorists, therefore, is to spell out just what\nsuch a \u201cwe\u201d comes to\u2014whether it is literally a new\nentity in the world somehow composed of the lover and the beloved, or\nwhether it is merely metaphorical. Variants of this view perhaps go\nback to Aristotle (cf. Sherman 1993) and can also be found in\nMontaigne ([E]) and Hegel (1997); contemporary proponents include\nSolomon (1981, 1988), Scruton (1986), Nozick (1989), Fisher (1990),\nand Delaney (1996).\n\nScruton, writing in particular about romantic love, claims that love\nexists \u201cjust so soon as reciprocity becomes community: that is,\njust so soon as all distinction between my interests and your\ninterests is overcome\u201d (1986, p. 230). The idea is that the\nunion is a union of concern, so that when I act out of that concern it\nis not for my sake alone or for your sake alone but for our\nsake. Fisher (1990) holds a similar, but somewhat more moderate view,\nclaiming that love is a partial fusion of the lovers\u2019\ncares, concerns, emotional responses, and actions. What is striking\nabout both Scruton and Fisher is the claim that love requires the\nactual union of the lovers\u2019 concerns, for it thus\nbecomes clear that they conceive of love not so much as an attitude we\ntake towards another but as a relationship: the distinction between\nyour interests and mine genuinely disappears only when we together\ncome to have shared cares, concerns, etc., and my merely having a\ncertain attitude towards you is not enough for love. This provides\ncontent to the notion of a \u201cwe\u201d as the (metaphorical?)\nsubject of these shared cares and concerns, and as that for whose sake\nwe act.\n\nSolomon (1988) offers a union view as well, though one that tries\n\u201cto make new sense out of \u2018love\u2019 through a literal\nrather than metaphoric sense of the \u2018fusion\u2019 of two\nsouls\u201d (p. 24, cf. Solomon 1981; however, it is unclear exactly\nwhat he means by a \u201csoul\u201d here and so how love can be a\n\u201cliteral\u201d fusion of two souls). What Solomon has in mind\nis the way in which, through love, the lovers redefine their\nidentities as persons in terms of the relationship: \u201cLove is the\nconcentration and the intensive focus of mutual definition on a single\nindividual, subjecting virtually every personal aspect of one\u2019s\nself to this process\u201d (1988, p. 197). The result is that lovers\ncome to share the interests, roles, virtues, and so on that constitute\nwhat formerly was two individual identities but now has become a\nshared identity, and they do so in part by each allowing the other to\nplay an important role in defining his own identity.\n\nNozick (1989) offers a union view that differs from those of Scruton,\nFisher, and Solomon in that Nozick thinks that what is necessary for\nlove is merely the desire to form a \u201cwe,\u201d\ntogether with the desire that your beloved reciprocates. Nonetheless,\nhe claims that this \u201cwe\u201d is \u201ca new entity in the\nworld\u2026created by a new web of relationships between [the\nlovers] which makes them no longer separate\u201d (p. 70). In\nspelling out this web of relationships, Nozick appeals to the lovers\n\u201cpooling\u201d not only their well-beings, in the sense that\nthe well-being of each is tied up with that of the other, but also\ntheir autonomy, in that \u201ceach transfers some previous rights to\nmake certain decisions unilaterally into a joint pool\u201d (p. 71).\nIn addition, Nozick claims, the lovers each acquire a new identity as\na part of the \u201cwe,\u201d a new identity constituted by their\n(a) wanting to be perceived publicly as a couple, (b) their attending\nto their pooled well-being, and (c) their accepting a \u201ccertain\nkind of division of labor\u201d (p. 72):\n\nA person in a we might find himself coming across something\ninteresting to read yet leaving it for the other person, not because\nhe himself would not be interested in it but because the other would\nbe more interested, and one of them reading it is sufficient for it to\nbe registered by the wider identity now shared, the\n we.[3]\n\n\nOpponents of the union view have seized on claims like this as\nexcessive: union theorists, they claim, take too literally the\nontological commitments of this notion of a \u201cwe.\u201d This\nleads to two specific criticisms of the union view. The first is that\nunion views do away with individual autonomy. Autonomy, it seems,\ninvolves a kind of independence on the part of the autonomous agent,\nsuch that she is in control over not only what she does but also who\nshe is, as this is constituted by her interests, values, concerns,\netc. However, union views, by doing away with a clear distinction\nbetween your interests and mine, thereby undermine this sort of\nindependence and so undermine the autonomy of the lovers. If autonomy\nis a part of the individual\u2019s good, then, on the union view,\nlove is to this extent bad; so much the worse for the union view\n(Singer 1994; Soble 1997). Moreover, Singer (1994) argues that a\nnecessary part of having your beloved be the object of your love is\nrespect for your beloved as the particular person she is, and this\nrequires respecting her autonomy.\n\nUnion theorists have responded to this objection in several ways.\nNozick (1989) seems to think of a loss of autonomy in love as a\ndesirable feature of the sort of union lovers can achieve. Fisher\n(1990), somewhat more reluctantly, claims that the loss of autonomy in\nlove is an acceptable consequence of love. Yet without further\nargument these claims seem like mere bullet biting. Solomon (1988, pp.\n64ff) describes this \u201ctension\u201d between union and autonomy\nas \u201cthe paradox of love.\u201d However, this a view that Soble\n(1997) derides: merely to call it a paradox, as Solomon does, is not\nto face up to the problem.\n\nThe second criticism involves a substantive view concerning love. Part\nof what it is to love someone, these opponents say, is to have concern\nfor him for his sake. However, union views make such concern\nunintelligible and eliminate the possibility of both selfishness and\nself-sacrifice, for by doing away with the distinction between my\ninterests and your interests they have in effect turned your interests\ninto mine and vice versa (Soble 1997; see also Blum 1980,\n1993). Some advocates of union views see this as a point in their\nfavor: we need to explain how it is I can have concern for people\nother than myself, and the union view apparently does this by\nunderstanding your interests to be part of my own. And Delaney,\nresponding to an apparent tension between our desire to be loved\nunselfishly (for fear of otherwise being exploited) and our desire to\nbe loved for reasons (which presumably are attractive to our lover and\nhence have a kind of selfish basis), says (1996, p. 346):\n\nGiven my view that the romantic ideal is primarily characterized by a\ndesire to achieve a profound consolidation of needs and interests\nthrough the formation of a we, I do not think a little\nselfishness of the sort described should pose a worry to either party.\n\n\nThe objection, however, lies precisely in this attempt to explain my\nconcern for my beloved egoistically. As Whiting (1991, p. 10) puts it,\nsuch an attempt \u201cstrikes me as unnecessary and potentially\nobjectionable colonization\u201d: in love, I ought to be concerned\nwith my beloved for her sake, and not because I somehow get\nsomething out of it. (This can be true whether my concern with my\nbeloved is merely instrumental to my good or whether it is partly\nconstitutive of my good.)\n\nAlthough Whiting\u2019s and Soble\u2019s criticisms here succeed\nagainst the more radical advocates of the union view, they in part\nfail to acknowledge the kernel of truth to be gleaned from the idea of\nunion. Whiting\u2019s way of formulating the second objection in\nterms of an unnecessary egoism in part points to a way out: we persons\nare in part social creatures, and love is one profound mode of that\nsociality. Indeed, part of the point of union accounts is to make\nsense of this social dimension: to make sense of a way in which we can\nsometimes identify ourselves with others not merely in becoming\ninterdependent with them (as Singer 1994, p. 165, suggests,\nunderstanding \u2018interdependence\u2019 to be a kind of reciprocal\nbenevolence and respect) but rather in making who we are as persons be\nconstituted in part by those we love (cf., e.g., Rorty 1986/1993;\nNussbaum 1990).\n\nAlong\n these lines, Friedman (1998), taking her inspiration in part from\nDelaney (1996), argues that we should understand the sort of union at\nissue in love to be a kind of federation of selves:\n\nOn the federation model, a third unified entity is constituted by the\ninteraction of the lovers, one which involves the lovers acting in\nconcert across a range of conditions and for a range of purposes. This\nconcerted action, however, does not erase the existence of the two\nlovers as separable and separate agents with continuing possibilities\nfor the exercise of their own respective agencies. [p. 165]\n\n\nGiven that on this view the lovers do not give up their individual\nidentities, there is no principled reason why the union view cannot\nmake sense of the lover\u2019s concern for her beloved for his\n sake.[4]\n Moreover, Friedman argues, once we construe union as federation, we\ncan see that autonomy is not a zero-sum game; rather, love can both\ndirectly enhance the autonomy of each and promote the growth of\nvarious skills, like realistic and critical self-evaluation, that\nfoster autonomy.\n\nNonetheless, this federation model is not without its\nproblems\u2014problems that affect other versions of the union view\nas well. For if the federation (or the \u201cwe\u201d, as on\nNozick\u2019s view) is understood as a third entity, we need a\nclearer account than has been given of its ontological status and how\nit comes to be. Relevant here is the literature on shared intention\nand plural subjects. Gilbert (1989, 1996, 2000) has argued that we\nshould take quite seriously the existence of a plural subject as an\nentity over and above its constituent members. Others, such as Tuomela\n(1984, 1995), Searle (1990), and Bratman (1999) are more cautious,\ntreating such talk of \u201cus\u201d having an intention as\nmetaphorical.\n3. Love as Robust Concern\n\nAs this criticism of the union view indicates, many find caring about\nyour beloved for her sake to be a part of what it is to love her. The\nrobust concern view of love takes this to be the central and defining\nfeature of love (cf. Taylor 1976; Newton-Smith 1989; Soble 1990, 1997;\nLaFollette 1996; Frankfurt 1999; White 2001). As Taylor puts it:\n\nTo summarize: if x loves y\n then x wants to benefit and be with y etc., and he\n has these wants (or at least some of them) because he\n believes y has some determinate characteristics \u03c8 in\n virtue of which he thinks it worth while to benefit and be\n with y. He regards satisfaction of these wants as an end and\n not as a means towards some other end. [p. 157]\n\n\nIn conceiving of my love for you as constituted by my concern for you\nfor your sake, the robust concern view rejects the idea, central to\nthe union view, that love is to be understood in terms of the (literal\nor metaphorical) creation of a \u201cwe\u201d: I am the one who has\nthis concern for you, though it is nonetheless disinterested and so\nnot egoistic insofar as it is for your sake rather than for my\n own.[5]\n\nAt the heart of the robust concern view is the idea that love\n\u201cis neither affective nor cognitive. It is volitional\u201d\n(Frankfurt 1999, p. 129; see also Martin 2015). Frankfurt\ncontinues:\n\nThat a person cares about or that he loves something has less to do\nwith how things make him feel, or with his opinions about them, than\nwith the more or less stable motivational structures that shape his\npreferences and that guide and limit his conduct.\n\n\nThis account analyzes caring about someone for her sake as a matter of\nbeing motivated in certain ways, in part as a response to what happens\nto one\u2019s beloved. Of course, to understand love in terms of\ndesires is not to leave other emotional responses out in the cold, for\nthese emotions should be understood as consequences of desires. Thus,\njust as I can be emotionally crushed when one of my strong desires is\ndisappointed, so too I can be emotionally crushed when things\nsimilarly go badly for my beloved. In this way Frankfurt (1999)\ntacitly, and White (2001) more explicitly, acknowledge the way in\nwhich my caring for my beloved for her sake results in my identity\nbeing transformed through her influence insofar as I become vulnerable\nto things that happen to her.\n\nNot all robust concern theorists seem to accept this line, however; in\nparticular, Taylor (1976) and Soble (1990) seem to have a strongly\nindividualistic conception of persons that prevents my identity being\nbound up with my beloved in this sort of way, a kind of view that may\nseem to undermine the intuitive \u201cdepth\u201d that love seems to\nhave. (For more on this point, see Rorty 1986/1993.) In the middle is\nStump (2006), who follows Aquinas in understanding love to involve not\nonly the desire for your beloved\u2019s well-being but also a desire\nfor a certain kind of relationship with your beloved\u2014as a parent\nor spouse or sibling or priest or friend, for example\u2014a\nrelationship within which you share yourself with and connect yourself\nto your\n beloved.[6]\n\nOne source of worry about the robust concern view is that it involves\ntoo passive an understanding of one\u2019s beloved (Ebels-Duggan\n2008). The thought is that on the robust concern view the lover merely\ntries to discover what the beloved\u2019s well-being consists in and\nthen acts to promote that, potentially by thwarting the\nbeloved\u2019s own efforts when the lover thinks those efforts would\nharm her well-being. This, however, would be disrespectful and\ndemeaning, not the sort of attitude that love is. What robust concern\nviews seem to miss, Ebels-Duggan suggests, is the way love involves\ninteracting agents, each with a capacity for autonomy the recognition\nand engagement with which is an essential part of love. In response,\nadvocates of the robust concern view might point out that promoting\nsomeone\u2019s well-being normally requires promoting her autonomy\n(though they may maintain that this need not always be true: that\npaternalism towards a beloved can sometimes be justified and\nappropriate as an expression of one\u2019s love). Moreover, we might\nplausibly think, it is only through the exercise of one\u2019s\nautonomy that one can define one\u2019s own well-being as a person,\nso that a lover\u2019s failure to respect the beloved\u2019s\nautonomy would be a failure to promote her well-being and therefore\nnot an expression of love, contrary to what Ebels-Duggan suggests.\nConsequently, it might seem, robust concern views can counter this\nobjection by offering an enriched conception of what it is to be a\nperson and so of the well-being of persons.\n\nAnother source of worry is that the robust concern view offers too\nthin a conception of love. By emphasizing robust concern, this view\nunderstands other features we think characteristic of love, such as\none\u2019s emotional responsiveness to one\u2019s beloved, to be the\neffects of that concern rather than constituents of it. Thus\nVelleman (1999) argues that robust concern views, by understanding\nlove merely as a matter of aiming at a particular end (viz., the\nwelfare of one\u2019s beloved), understand love to be merely\nconative. However, he claims, love can have nothing to do with\ndesires, offering as a counterexample the possibility of loving a\ntroublemaking relation whom you do not want to be with, whose well\nbeing you do not want to promote, etc. Similarly, Badhwar (2003)\nargues that such a \u201cteleological\u201d view of love makes it\nmysterious how \u201cwe can continue to love someone long after death\nhas taken him beyond harm or benefit\u201d (p. 46). Moreover Badhwar\nargues, if love is essentially a desire, then it implies that we lack\nsomething; yet love does not imply this and, indeed, can be felt most\nstrongly at times when we feel our lives most complete and lacking in\nnothing. Consequently, Velleman and Badhwar conclude, love need not\ninvolve any desire or concern for the well-being of one\u2019s\nbeloved.\n\nThis conclusion, however, seems too hasty, for such examples can be\naccommodated within the robust concern view. Thus, the concern for\nyour relative in Velleman\u2019s example can be understood to be\npresent but swamped by other, more powerful desires to avoid him.\nIndeed, keeping the idea that you want to some degree to benefit him,\nan idea Velleman rejects, seems to be essential to understanding the\nconceptual tension between loving someone and not wanting to help him,\na tension Velleman does not fully acknowledge. Similarly, continued\nlove for someone who has died can be understood on the robust concern\nview as parasitic on the former love you had for him when he was still\nalive: your desires to benefit him get transformed, through your\nsubsequent understanding of the impossibility of doing so, into\n wishes.[7]\n Finally, the idea of concern for your beloved\u2019s well-being need\nnot imply the idea that you lack something, for such concern can be\nunderstood in terms of the disposition to be vigilant for occasions\nwhen you can come to his aid and consequently to have the relevant\noccurrent desires. All of this seems fully compatible with the robust\nconcern view.\n\nOne might also question whether Velleman and Badhwar make proper use\nof their examples of loving your meddlesome relation or someone who\nhas died. For although we can understand these as genuine cases of\nlove, they are nonetheless deficient cases and ought\ntherefore be understood as parasitic on the standard cases. Readily to\naccommodate such deficient cases of love into a philosophical analysis\nas being on a par with paradigm cases, and to do so without some\nspecial justification, is dubious.\n\nNonetheless, the robust concern view as it stands does not seem\nproperly able to account for the intuitive \u201cdepth\u201d of love\nand so does not seem properly to distinguish loving from liking.\nAlthough, as noted above, the robust concern view can begin to make\nsome sense of the way in which the lover\u2019s identity is altered\nby the beloved, it understands this only an effect of love,\nand not as a central part of what love consists in.\n\nThis vague thought is nicely developed by Wonderly (2017), who\nemphasizes that in addition to the sort of disinterested concern for\nanother that is central to robust-concern accounts of love, an\nessential part of at least romantic love is the idea that in loving\nsomeone I must find them to be not merely important for their own sake\nbut also important to me. Wonderly (2017) fleshes out what\nthis \u201cimportance to me\u201d involves in terms of the idea of\nattachment (developed in Wonderly 2016) that she argues can make sense\nof the intimacy and depth of love from within what remains\nfundamentally a robust-concern\n account.[8]\n4. Love as Valuing\n\nA third kind of view of love understands love to be a distinctive mode\nof valuing a person. As the distinction between eros and\nagape in\n Section 1\n indicates, there are at least two ways to construe this in terms of\nwhether the lover values the beloved because she is valuable, or\nwhether the beloved comes to be valuable to the lover as a result of\nher loving him. The former view, which understands the lover as\nappraising the value of the beloved in loving him, is the\ntopic of\n Section 4.1,\n whereas the latter view, which understands her as bestowing\nvalue on him, will be discussed in\n Section 4.2.\n4.1 Love as Appraisal of Value\n\nVelleman (1999, 2008) offers an appraisal view of love, understanding\nlove to be fundamentally a matter of acknowledging and responding in a\ndistinctive way to the value of the beloved. (For a very different\nappraisal view of love, see Kolodny 2003.) Understanding this more\nfully requires understanding both the kind of value of the beloved to\nwhich one responds and the distinctive kind of response to such value\nthat love is. Nonetheless, it should be clear that what makes an\naccount be an appraisal view of love is not the mere fact that love is\nunderstood to involve appraisal; many other accounts do so, and it is\ntypical of robust concern accounts, for example (cf. the quote from\nTaylor\n above,\n Section 3). Rather, appraisal views are distinctive in\nunderstanding love to consist in that appraisal.\n\nIn articulating the kind of value love involves, Velleman, following\nKant, distinguishes dignity from price. To have a price, as\nthe economic metaphor suggests, is to have a value that can be\ncompared to the value of other things with prices, such that it is\nintelligible to exchange without loss items of the same value. By\ncontrast, to have dignity is to have a value such that\ncomparisons of relative value become meaningless. Material goods are\nnormally understood to have prices, but we persons have dignity: no\nsubstitution of one person for another can preserve exactly the same\nvalue, for something of incomparable worth would be lost (and gained)\nin such a substitution.\n\nOn this Kantian view, our dignity as persons consists in our rational\nnature: our capacity both to be actuated by reasons that we\nautonomously provide ourselves in setting our own ends and to respond\nappropriately to the intrinsic values we discover in the world.\nConsequently, one important way in which we exercise our rational\nnatures is to respond with respect to the dignity of other persons (a\ndignity that consists in part in their capacity for respect):\nrespect just is the required minimal response to the dignity\nof persons. What makes a response to a person be that of respect,\nVelleman claims, still following Kant, is that it \u201carrests our\nself-love\u201d and thereby prevents us from treating him as a means\nto our ends (p. 360).\n\nGiven this, Velleman claims that love is similarly a response to the\ndignity of persons, and as such it is the dignity of the object of our\nlove that justifies that love. However, love and respect are different\nkinds of responses to the same value. For love arrests not our\nself-love but rather\n\nour tendencies toward emotional self-protection from another person,\ntendencies to draw ourselves in and close ourselves off from being\naffected by him. Love disarms our emotional defenses; it makes us\nvulnerable to the other. [1999, p. 361]\n\n\nThis means that the concern, attraction, sympathy, etc. that we\nnormally associate with love are not constituents of love but are\nrather its normal effects, and love can remain without them (as in the\ncase of the love for a meddlesome relative one cannot stand being\naround). Moreover, this provides Velleman with a clear account of the\nintuitive \u201cdepth\u201d of love: it is essentially a response to\npersons as such, and to say that you love your dog is therefore to be\nconfused.\n\nOf course, we do not respond with love to the dignity of every person\nwe meet, nor are we somehow required to: love, as the disarming of our\nemotional defenses in a way that makes us especially vulnerable to\nanother, is the optional maximal response to others\u2019 dignity.\nWhat, then, explains the selectivity of love\u2014why I love some\npeople and not others? The answer lies in the contingent fit between\nthe way some people behaviorally express their dignity as persons and\nthe way I happen to respond to those expressions by becoming\nemotionally vulnerable to them. The right sort of fit makes someone\n\u201clovable\u201d by me (1999, p. 372), and my responding with\nlove in these cases is a matter of my \u201creally seeing\u201d this\nperson in a way that I fail to do with others who do not fit with me\nin this way. By \u2018lovable\u2019 here Velleman seems to mean\nable to be loved, not worthy of being loved, for\nnothing Velleman says here speaks to a question about the\njustification of my loving this person rather than that. Rather, what\nhe offers is an explanation of the selectivity of my love, an\nexplanation that as a matter of fact makes my response be that of love\nrather than mere respect.\n\nThis understanding of the selectivity of love as something that can be\nexplained but not justified is potentially troubling. For we\nordinarily think we can justify not only my loving you rather than\nsomeone else but also and more importantly the constancy of my love:\nmy continuing to love you even as you change in certain fundamental\nways (but not others). As Delaney (1996, p. 347) puts the worry about\nconstancy:\n\nwhile you seem to want it to be true that, were you to become a\nschmuck, your lover would continue to love you,\u2026you also want\nit to be the case that your lover would never love a schmuck.\n\n\nThe issue here is not merely that we can offer explanations of the\nselectivity of my love, of why I do not love schmucks; rather, at\nissue is the discernment of love, of loving and continuing to\nlove for good reasons as well as of ceasing to love for good reasons.\nTo have these good reasons seems to involve attributing different\nvalues to you now rather than formerly or rather than to someone else,\nyet this is precisely what Velleman denies is the case in making the\ndistinction between love and respect the way he does.\n\nIt is also questionable whether Velleman can even explain the\nselectivity of love in terms of the \u201cfit\u201d between your\nexpressions and my sensitivities. For the relevant sensitivities on my\npart are emotional sensitivities: the lowering of my emotional\ndefenses and so becoming emotionally vulnerable to you. Thus, I become\nvulnerable to the harms (or goods) that befall you and so\nsympathetically feel your pain (or joy). Such emotions are themselves\nassessable for warrant, and now we can ask why my disappointment that\nyou lost the race is warranted, but my being disappointed that a mere\nstranger lost would not be warranted. The intuitive answer is that I\nlove you but not him. However, this answer is unavailable to Velleman,\nbecause he thinks that what makes my response to your dignity that of\nlove rather than respect is precisely that I feel such emotions, and\nto appeal to my love in explaining the emotions therefore seems\nviciously circular.\n\nAlthough these problems are specific to Velleman\u2019s account, the\ndifficulty can be generalized to any appraisal account of love (such\nas that offered in Kolodny 2003). For if love is an appraisal, it\nneeds to be distinguished from other forms of appraisal, including our\nevaluative judgments. On the one hand, to try to distinguish love as\nan appraisal from other appraisals in terms of love\u2019s having\ncertain effects on our emotional and motivational life (as on\nVelleman\u2019s account) is unsatisfying because it ignores part of\nwhat needs to be explained: why the appraisal of love has these\neffects and yet judgments with the same evaluative content do not.\nIndeed, this question is crucial if we are to understand the intuitive\n\u201cdepth\u201d of love, for without an answer to this question we\ndo not understand why love should have the kind of centrality in our\nlives it manifestly\n does.[9]\n On the other hand, to bundle this emotional component into the\nappraisal itself would be to turn the view into either the robust\nconcern view\n (Section 3)\n or a variant of the emotion view\n (Section 5.1).\n4.2 Love as Bestowal of Value\n\nIn contrast to Velleman, Singer (1991, 1994, 2009) understands love to\nbe fundamentally a matter of bestowing value on the beloved. To\nbestow value on another is to project a kind of intrinsic\nvalue onto him. Indeed, this fact about love is supposed to\ndistinguish love from liking: \u201cLove is an attitude with no clear\nobjective,\u201d whereas liking is inherently teleological (1991, p.\n272). As such, there are no standards of correctness for bestowing\nsuch value, and this is how love differs from other personal attitudes\nlike gratitude, generosity, and condescension:\n\u201clove\u2026confers importance no matter what the\nobject is worth\u201d (p. 273). Consequently, Singer thinks, love is\nnot an attitude that can be justified in any way.\n\nWhat is it, exactly, to bestow this kind of value on someone? It is,\nSinger says, a kind of attachment and commitment to the beloved, in\nwhich one comes to treat him as an end in himself and so to respond to\nhis ends, interests, concerns, etc. as having value for their own\nsake. This means in part that the bestowal of value reveals itself\n\u201cby caring about the needs and interests of the beloved, by\nwishing to benefit or protect her, by delighting in her\nachievements,\u201d etc. (p. 270). This sounds very much like the\nrobust concern view, yet the bestowal view differs in understanding\nsuch robust concern to be the effect of the bestowal of value\nthat is love rather than itself what constitutes love: in bestowing\nvalue on my beloved, I make him be valuable in such a way that I ought\nto respond with robust concern.\n\nFor it to be intelligible that I have bestowed value on someone, I\nmust therefore respond appropriately to him as valuable, and this\nrequires having some sense of what his well-being is and of what\naffects that well-being positively or negatively. Yet having this\nsense requires in turn knowing what his strengths and deficiencies\nare, and this is a matter of appraising him in various ways. Bestowal\nthus presupposes a kind of appraisal, as a way of \u201creally\nseeing\u201d the beloved and attending to him. Nonetheless, Singer\nclaims, it is the bestowal that is primary for understanding what love\nconsists in: the appraisal is required only so that the commitment to\none\u2019s beloved and his value as thus bestowed has practical\nimport and is not \u201ca blind submission to some unknown\nbeing\u201d (1991, p. 272; see also Singer 1994, pp. 139ff).\n\nSinger is walking a tightrope in trying to make room for appraisal in\nhis account of love. Insofar as the account is fundamentally a\nbestowal account, Singer claims that love cannot be justified, that we\nbestow the relevant kind of value \u201cgratuitously.\u201d This\nsuggests that love is blind, that it does not matter what our beloved\nis like, which seems patently false. Singer tries to avoid this\nconclusion by appealing to the role of appraisal: it is only because\nwe appraise another as having certain virtues and vices that we come\nto bestow value on him. Yet the \u201cbecause\u201d here, since it\ncannot justify the bestowal, is at best a kind of contingent causal\nexplanation.\n [10]\n In this respect, Singer\u2019s account of the selectivity of love is\nmuch the same as Velleman\u2019s, and it is liable to the same\ncriticism: it makes unintelligible the way in which our love can be\ndiscerning for better or worse reasons. Indeed, this failure to make\nsense of the idea that love can be justified is a problem for any\nbestowal view. For either (a) a bestowal itself cannot be justified\n(as on Singer\u2019s account), in which case the justification of\nlove is impossible, or (b) a bestowal can be justified, in which case\nit is hard to make sense of value as being bestowed rather than there\nantecedently in the object as the grounds of that\n\u201cbestowal.\u201d\n\nMore generally, a proponent of the bestowal view needs to be much\nclearer than Singer is in articulating precisely what a bestowal is.\nWhat is the value that I create in a bestowal, and how can my bestowal\ncreate it? On a crude Humean view, the answer might be that the value\nis something projected onto the world through my pro-attitudes, like\ndesire. Yet such a view would be inadequate, since the projected\nvalue, being relative to a particular individual, would do no\ntheoretical work, and the account would essentially be a variant of\nthe robust concern view. Moreover, in providing a bestowal account of\nlove, care is needed to distinguish love from other personal attitudes\nsuch as admiration and respect: do these other attitudes involve\nbestowal? If so, how does the bestowal in these cases differ from the\nbestowal of love? If not, why not, and what is so special about love\nthat requires a fundamentally different evaluative attitude than\nadmiration and respect?\n\nNonetheless, there is a kernel of truth in the bestowal view: there is\nsurely something right about the idea that love is creative and not\nmerely a response to antecedent value, and accounts of love that\nunderstand the kind of evaluation implicit in love merely in terms of\nappraisal seem to be missing something. Precisely what may be missed\nwill be discussed below in\n Section 6.\n4.3 An Intermediate Position?\n\nPerhaps there is room for an understanding of love and its relation to\nvalue that is intermediate between appraisal and bestowal accounts.\nAfter all, if we think of appraisal as something like perception, a\nmatter of responding to what is out there in the world, and of\nbestowal as something like action, a matter of doing something and\ncreating something, we should recognize that the responsiveness\ncentral to appraisal may itself depend on our active, creative\nchoices. Thus, just as we must recognize that ordinary perception\ndepends on our actively directing our attention and deploying\nconcepts, interpretations, and even arguments in order to perceive\nthings accurately, so too we might think our vision of our\nbeloved\u2019s valuable properties that is love also depends on our\nactively attending to and interpreting him. Something like this is\nJollimore\u2019s view (2011). According to Jollimore, in loving\nsomeone we actively attend to his valuable properties in a way that we\ntake to provide us with reasons to treat him preferentially. Although\nwe may acknowledge that others might have such properties even to a\ngreater degree than our beloved does, we do not attend to and\nappreciate such properties in others in the same way we do those in\nour beloveds; indeed, we find our appreciation of our beloved\u2019s\nvaluable properties to \u201csilence\u201d our similar appreciation\nof those in others. (In this way, Jollimore thinks, we can solve the\nproblem of fungibility, discussed below in\n Section 6.)\n Likewise, in perceiving our beloved\u2019s actions and character, we\ndo so through the lens of such an appreciation, which will tend as to\n\u201csilence\u201d interpretations inconsistent with that\nappreciation. In this way, love involves finding one\u2019s beloved\nto be valuable in a way that involves elements of both appraisal\n(insofar as one must thereby be responsive to valuable properties\none\u2019s beloved really has) and bestowal (insofar as through\none\u2019s attention and committed appreciation of these properties\nthey come to have special significance for one).\n\nOne might object that this conception of love as silencing the special\nvalue of others or to negative interpretations of our beloveds is\nirrational in a way that love is not. For, it might seem, such\n\u201csilencing\u201d is merely a matter of our blinding\nourselves to how things really are. Yet Jollimore claims that this\nsense in which love is blind is not objectionable, for (a) we can\nstill intellectually recognize the things that love\u2019s vision\nsilences, and (b) there really is no impartial perspective we can take\non the values things have, and love is one appropriate sort of partial\nperspective from which the value of persons can be manifest.\nNonetheless, one might wonder about whether that perspective of love\nitself can be distorted and what the norms are in terms of which such\ndistortions are intelligible. Furthermore, it may seem that\nJollimore\u2019s attempt to reconcile appraisal and bestowal fails to\nappreciate the underlying metaphysical difficulty: appraisal is a\nresponse to value that is antecedently there, whereas bestowal is the\ncreation of value that was not antecedently there. Consequently, it\nmight seem, appraisal and bestowal are mutually exclusive and cannot\nbe reconciled in the way Jollimore hopes.\n\nWhereas Jollimore tries to combine separate elements of appraisal and\nof bestowal in a single account, Helm (2010) and Bagley (2015) offer\naccounts that reject the metaphysical presupposition that values must\nbe either prior to love (as with appraisal) or posterior to love (as\nwith bestowal), instead understanding the love and the values to\nemerge simultaneously. Thus, Helm presents a detailed account of\nvaluing in terms of the emotions, arguing that while we can understand\nindividual emotions as appraisals, responding to values\nalready their in their objects, these values are bestowed on\nthose objects via broad, holistic patterns of emotions. How this\namounts to an account of love will be discussed in\n Section 5.2,\n below. Bagley (2015) instead appeals to a metaphor of improvisation,\narguing that just as jazz musicians jointly make determinate the\ncontent of their musical ideas through on-going processes of their\nexpression, so too lovers jointly engage in \u201cdeep\nimprovisation\u201d, thereby working out of their values and\nidentities through the on-going process of living their lives\ntogether. These values are thus something the lovers jointly construct\nthrough the process of recognizing and responding to those very\nvalues. To love someone is thus to engage with them as partners in\nsuch \u201cdeep improvisation\u201d. (This account is similar to\nHelm (2008, 2010)\u2019s account of plural agency, which he uses to\nprovide an account of friendship and other loving relationships; see\nthe discussion of\n shared activity\n in the entry on\n friendship.)\n5. Emotion Views\n\nGiven these problems with the accounts of love as valuing, perhaps we\nshould turn to the emotions. For emotions just are responses to\nobjects that combine evaluation, motivation, and a kind of\nphenomenology, all central features of the attitude of love.\n\nMany accounts of love claim that it is an emotion; these include:\nWollheim 1984, Rorty 1986/1993, Brown 1987, Hamlyn 1989, Baier 1991,\nand Badhwar\n 2003.[11]\n Thus, Hamlyn (1989, p. 219) says:\n\nIt would not be a plausible move to defend any theory of the emotions\nto which love and hate seemed exceptions by saying that love and hate\nare after all not emotions. I have heard this said, but it does seem\nto me a desperate move to make. If love and hate are not emotions what\nis?\n\n\nThe difficulty with this claim, as Rorty (1980) argues, is that the\nword, \u2018emotion,\u2019 does not seem to pick out a homogeneous\ncollection of mental states, and so various theories claiming that\nlove is an emotion mean very different things. Consequently, what are\nhere labeled \u201cemotion views\u201d are divided into those that\nunderstand love to be a particular kind of evaluative-cum-motivational\nresponse to an object, whether that response is merely occurrent or\ndispositional (\u2018emotions proper,\u2019 see\n Section 5.1,\n below), and those that understand love to involve a collection of\nrelated and interconnected emotions proper (\u2018emotion\ncomplexes,\u2019 see\n Section 5.2,\n below).\n5.1 Love as Emotion Proper\n\nAn emotion proper is a kind of\n\u201cevaluative-cum-motivational response to an object\u201d; what\ndoes this mean? Emotions are generally understood to have several\nobjects. The target of an emotion is that at which the\nemotion is directed: if I am afraid or angry at you, then you are the\ntarget. In responding to you with fear or anger, I am implicitly\nevaluating you in a particular way, and this evaluation\u2014called\nthe formal object\u2014is the kind of evaluation of the\ntarget that is distinctive of a particular emotion type. Thus, in\nfearing you, I implicitly evaluate you as somehow dangerous, whereas\nin being angry at you I implicitly evaluate you as somehow offensive.\nYet emotions are not merely evaluations of their targets; they in part\nmotivate us to behave in certain ways, both rationally (by motivating\naction to avoid the danger) and arationally (via certain\ncharacteristic expressions, such as slamming a door out of anger).\nMoreover, emotions are generally understood to involve a\nphenomenological component, though just how to understand the\ncharacteristic \u201cfeel\u201d of an emotion and its relation to\nthe evaluation and motivation is hotly disputed. Finally, emotions are\ntypically understood to be passions: responses that we feel imposed on\nus as if from the outside, rather than anything we actively do. (For\nmore on the philosophy of emotions, see entry on\n emotion.)\n\nWhat then are we saying when we say that love is an emotion proper?\nAccording to Brown (1987, p. 14), emotions as occurrent mental states\nare \u201cabnormal bodily changes caused by the agent\u2019s\nevaluation or appraisal of some object or situation that the agent\nbelieves to be of concern to him or her.\u201d He spells this out by\nsaying that in love, we \u201ccherish\u201d the person for having\n\u201ca particular complex of instantiated qualities\u201d that is\n\u201copen-ended\u201d so that we can continue to love the person\neven as she changes over time (pp. 106\u20137). These qualities,\nwhich include historical and relational qualities, are evaluated in\nlove as\n worthwhile.[12]\n All of this seems aimed at spelling out what love\u2019s formal\nobject is, a task that is fundamental to understanding love as an\nemotion proper. Thus, Brown seems to say that love\u2019s formal\nobject is just being worthwhile (or, given his examples, perhaps:\nworthwhile as a person), and he resists being any more specific than\nthis in order to preserve the open-endedness of love. Hamlyn (1989)\noffers a similar account, saying (p. 228):\n\nWith love the difficulty is to find anything of this kind [i.e., a\nformal object] which is uniquely appropriate to love. My thesis is\nthat there is nothing of this kind that must be so, and that this\ndifferentiates it and hate from the other emotions.\n\n\nHamlyn goes on to suggest that love and hate might be primordial\nemotions, a kind of positive or negative \u201cfeeling\ntowards,\u201d presupposed by all other\n emotions.[13]\n\nThe trouble with these accounts of love as an emotion proper is that\nthey provide too thin a conception of love. In Hamlyn\u2019s case,\nlove is conceived as a fairly generic pro-attitude, rather than as the\nspecific kind of distinctively personal attitude discussed\nhere. In Brown\u2019s case, spelling out the formal object of love as\nsimply being worthwhile (as a person) fails to distinguish love from\nother evaluative responses like admiration and respect. Part of the\nproblem seems to be the rather simple account of what an emotion is\nthat Brown and Hamlyn use as their starting point: if love is an\nemotion, then the understanding of what an emotion is must be enriched\nconsiderably to accommodate love. Yet it is not at all clear whether\nthe idea of an \u201cemotion proper\u201d can be adequately enriched\nso as to do so. As Pismenny & Prinz (2017) point out, love seems\nto be too varied both in its ground and in the sort of experience it\ninvolves to be capturable by a single emotion.\n5.2 Love as Emotion Complex\n\nThe emotion complex view, which understands love to be a complex\nemotional attitude towards another person, may initially seem to hold\nout great promise to overcome the problems of alternative types of\nviews. By articulating the emotional interconnections between persons,\nit could offer a satisfying account of the \u201cdepth\u201d of love\nwithout the excesses of the union view and without the overly narrow\nteleological focus of the robust concern view; and because these\nemotional interconnections are themselves evaluations, it could offer\nan understanding of love as simultaneously evaluative, without needing\nto specify a single formal object of love. However, the devil is in\nthe details.\n\nRorty\n (1986/1993) does not try to present a complete account of love;\nrather, she focuses on the idea that \u201crelational psychological\nattitudes\u201d which, like love, essentially involve emotional and\ndesiderative responses, exhibit historicity: \u201cthey\narise from, and are shaped by, dynamic interactions between a subject\nand an object\u201d (p. 73). In part this means that what makes an\nattitude be one of love is not the presence of a state that we can\npoint to at a particular time within the lover; rather, love is to be\n\u201cidentified by a characteristic narrative history\u201d (p.\n75). Moreover, Rorty argues, the historicity of love involves the\nlover\u2019s being permanently transformed by loving who he does.\n\nBaier (1991), seeming to pick up on this understanding of love as\nexhibiting historicity, says (p. 444):\n\nLove is not just an emotion people feel toward other people, but also\na complex tying together of the emotions that two or a few more people\nhave; it is a special form of emotional interdependence.\n\n\nTo a certain extent, such emotional interdependence involves feeling\nsympathetic emotions, so that, for example, I feel disappointed and\nfrustrated on behalf of my beloved when she fails, and joyful when she\nsucceeds. However, Baier insists, love is \u201cmore than just the\nduplication of the emotion of each in a sympathetic echo in the\nother\u201d (p. 442); the emotional interdependence of the lovers\ninvolves also appropriate follow-up responses to the emotional\npredicaments of your beloved. Two examples Baier gives (pp.\n443\u201344) are a feeling of \u201cmischievous delight\u201d at\nyour beloved\u2019s temporary bafflement, and amusement at her\nembarrassment. The idea is that in a loving relationship your beloved\ngives you permission to feel such emotions when no one else is\npermitted to do so, and a condition of her granting you that\npermission is that you feel these emotions \u201ctenderly.\u201d\nMoreover, you ought to respond emotionally to your beloved\u2019s\nemotional responses to you: by feeling hurt when she is indifferent to\nyou, for example. All of these foster the sort of emotional\ninterdependence Baier is after\u2014a kind of intimacy you have with\nyour beloved.\n\nBadhwar (2003, p. 46) similarly understands love to be a matter of\n\u201cone\u2019s overall emotional orientation towards a\nperson\u2014the complex of perceptions, thoughts, and\nfeelings\u201d; as such, love is a matter of having a certain\n\u201ccharacter structure.\u201d Central to this complex emotional\norientation, Badhwar thinks, is what she calls the \u201clook of\nlove\u201d: \u201can ongoing [emotional] affirmation of the loved\nobject as worthy of existence\u2026for her own sake\u201d (p. 44),\nan affirmation that involves taking pleasure in your beloved\u2019s\nwell-being. Moreover, Badhwar claims, the look of love also provides\nto the beloved reliable testimony concerning the quality of the\nbeloved\u2019s character and actions (p. 57).\n\nThere is surely something very right about the idea that love, as an\nattitude central to deeply personal relationships, should not be\nunderstood as a state that can simply come and go. Rather, as the\nemotion complex view insists, the complexity of love is to be found in\nthe historical patterns of one\u2019s emotional responsiveness to\none\u2019s beloved\u2014a pattern that also projects into the\nfuture. Indeed, as suggested above, the kind of emotional\ninterdependence that results from this complex pattern can seem to\naccount for the intuitive \u201cdepth\u201d of love as fully\ninterwoven into one\u2019s emotional sense of oneself. And it seems\nto make some headway in understanding the complex phenomenology of\nlove: love can at times be a matter of intense pleasure in the\npresence of one\u2019s beloved, yet it can at other times involve\nfrustration, exasperation, anger, and hurt as a manifestation of the\ncomplexities and depth of the relationships it fosters.\n\nThis understanding of love as constituted by a history of emotional\ninterdependence enables emotion complex views to say something\ninteresting about the impact love has on the lover\u2019s identity.\nThis is partly Rorty\u2019s point (1986/1993) in her discussion of\nthe historicity of love\n (above).\n Thus, she argues, one important feature of such historicity is that\nlove is \u201cdynamically permeable\u201d in that the lover\nis continually \u201cchanged by loving\u201d such that these changes\n\u201ctend to ramify through a person\u2019s character\u201d (p.\n77). Through such dynamic permeability, love transforms the identity\nof the lover in a way that can sometimes foster the continuity of the\nlove, as each lover continually changes in response to the changes in\nthe\n other.[14]\n Indeed, Rorty concludes, love should be understood in terms of\n\u201ca characteristic narrative history\u201d (p. 75) that results\nfrom such dynamic permeability. It should be clear, however, that the\nmere fact of dynamic permeability need not result in the love\u2019s\ncontinuing: nothing about the dynamics of a relationship requires that\nthe characteristic narrative history project into the future, and such\npermeability can therefore lead to the dissolution of the love. Love\nis therefore risky\u2014indeed, all the more risky because of the way\nthe identity of the lover is defined in part through the love. The\nloss of a love can therefore make one feel no longer oneself in ways\npoignantly described by Nussbaum (1990).\n\nBy focusing on such emotionally complex histories, emotion complex\nviews differ from most alternative accounts of love. For alternative\naccounts tend to view love as a kind of attitude we take toward our\nbeloveds, something we can analyze simply in terms of our mental state\nat the\n moment.[15]\n By ignoring this historical dimension of love in providing an account\nof what love is, alternative accounts have a hard time providing\neither satisfying accounts of the sense in which our identities as\nperson are at stake in loving another or satisfactory solutions to\nproblems concerning how love is to be justified (cf.\n Section 6,\n especially the discussion of\n fungibility).\n\nNonetheless, some questions remain. If love is to be understood as an\nemotion complex, we need a much more explicit account of the pattern\nat issue here: what ties all of these emotional responses together\ninto a single thing, namely love? Baier and Badhwar seem content to\nprovide interesting and insightful examples of this pattern, but that\ndoes not seem to be enough. For example, what connects my amusement at\nmy beloved\u2019s embarrassment to other emotions like my joy on his\nbehalf when he succeeds? Why shouldn\u2019t my amusement at his\nembarrassment be understood instead as a somewhat cruel case of\nschadenfreude and so as antithetical to, and disconnected\nfrom, love? Moreover, as Naar (2013) notes, we need a principled\naccount of when such historical patterns are disrupted in such a way\nas to end the love and when they are not. Do I stop loving when, in\nthe midst of clinical depression, I lose my normal pattern of\nemotional concern?\n\nPresumably the answer requires returning to the historicity of love:\nit all depends on the historical details of the relationship my\nbeloved and I have forged. Some loves develop so that the intimacy\nwithin the relationship is such as to allow for tender, teasing\nresponses to each other, whereas other loves may not. The historical\ndetails, together with the lovers\u2019 understanding of their\nrelationship, presumably determine which emotional responses belong to\nthe pattern constitutive of love and which do not. However, this\nanswer so far is inadequate: not just any historical relationship\ninvolving emotional interdependence is a loving relationship, and we\nneed a principled way of distinguishing loving relationships from\nother relational evaluative attitudes: precisely what is the\ncharacteristic narrative history that is characteristic of love?\n\nHelm (2009, 2010) tries to answer some of these questions in\npresenting an account of love as intimate identification. To love\nanother, Helm claims, is to care about him as the particular person he\nis and so, other things being equal, to value the things he values.\nInsofar as a person\u2019s (structured) set of values\u2014his sense\nof the kind of life worth his living\u2014constitutes his\nidentity as a person, such sharing of values amounts to\nsharing his identity, which sounds very much like union accounts of\nlove. However, Helm is careful to understand such sharing of values as\nfor the sake of the beloved (as robust concern accounts insist), and\nhe spells this all out in terms of patterns of emotions. Thus, Helm\nclaims, all emotions have not only a target and a formal object (as\nindicated above), but also a focus: a background object the\nsubject cares about in terms of which the implicit evaluation of the\ntarget is made intelligible. (For example, if I am afraid of the\napproaching hailstorm, I thereby evaluate it as dangerous, and what\nexplains this evaluation is the way that hailstorm bears on my\nvegetable garden, which I care about; my garden, therefore, is the\nfocus of my fear.) Moreover, emotions normally come in patterns with a\ncommon focus: fearing the hailstorm is normally connected to other\nemotions as being relieved when it passes by harmlessly (or\ndisappointed or sad when it does not), being angry at the rabbits for\nkilling the spinach, delighted at the productivity of the tomato\nplants, etc. Helm argues that a projectible pattern of such emotions\nwith a common focus constitute caring about that focus. Consequently,\nwe might say along the lines of\n Section 4.3,\n while particular emotions appraise events in the world as having\ncertain evaluative properties, their having these properties is partly\nbestowed on them by the overall patterns of emotions.\n\nHelm identifies some emotions as person-focused emotions:\nemotions like pride and shame that essentially take persons as their\nfocuses, for these emotions implicitly evaluate in terms of the\ntarget\u2019s bearing on the quality of life of the person that is\ntheir focus. To exhibit a pattern of such emotions focused on oneself\nand subfocused on being a mother, for example, is to care about the\nplace being a mother has in the kind of life you find worth\nliving\u2014in your identity as a person; to care in this way is to\nvalue being a mother as a part of your concern for your own\nidentity. Likewise, to exhibit a projectible pattern of such emotions\nfocused on someone else and subfocused on his being a father is to\nvalue this as a part of your concern for his\nidentity\u2014to value it for his sake. Such sharing of\nanother\u2019s values for his sake, which, Helm argues, essentially\ninvolves trust, respect, and affection, amounts to intimate\nidentification with him, and such intimate identification just is\nlove. Thus, Helm tries to provide an account of love that is grounded\nin an explicit account of caring (and caring about something for the\nsake of someone else) that makes room for the intuitive\n\u201cdepth\u201d of love through intimate identification.\n\nJaworska & Wonderly (2017) argue that Helm\u2019s construal of\nintimacy as intimate identification is too demanding. Rather, they\nargue, the sort of intimacy that distinguishes love from mere caring\nis one that involves a kind of emotional vulnerability in which things\ngoing well or poorly for one\u2019s beloved are directly connected\nnot merely to one\u2019s well-being, but to one\u2019s ability to\nflourish. This connection, they argue, runs through the lover\u2019s\nself-understanding and the place the beloved has in the lover\u2019s\nsense of a meaningful life.\n6. The Value and Justification of Love\n\nWhy do we love? It has been suggested above that any account of love\nneeds to be able to answer some such justificatory question. Although\nthe issue of the justification of love is important on its own, it is\nalso important for the implications it has for understanding more\nclearly the precise object of love: how can we make sense of the\nintuitions not only that we love the individuals themselves rather\nthan their properties, but also that my beloved is not\nfungible\u2014that no one could simply take her place without loss.\nDifferent theories approach these questions in different ways, but, as\nwill become clear below, the question of justification is primary.\n\nOne way to understand the question of why we love is as asking for\nwhat the value of love is: what do we get out of it? One kind of\nanswer, which has its roots in Aristotle, is that having loving\nrelationships promotes self-knowledge insofar as your beloved acts as\na kind of mirror, reflecting your character back to you (Badhwar,\n2003, p. 58). Of course, this answer presupposes that we cannot\naccurately know ourselves in other ways: that left alone, our sense of\nourselves will be too imperfect, too biased, to help us grow and\nmature as persons. The metaphor of a mirror also suggests that our\nbeloveds will be in the relevant respects similar to us, so that\nmerely by observing them, we can come to know ourselves better in a\nway that is, if not free from bias, at least more objective than\notherwise.\n\nBrink (1999, pp. 264\u201365) argues that there are serious limits to\nthe value of such mirroring of one\u2019s self in a beloved. For if\nthe aim is not just to know yourself better but to improve\nyourself, you ought also to interact with others who are not just like\nyourself: interacting with such diverse others can help you recognize\nalternative possibilities for how to live and so better assess the\nrelative merits of these possibilities. Whiting (2013) also emphasizes\nthe importance of our beloveds\u2019 having an independent voice\ncapable of reflecting not who one now is but an ideal for who one is\nto be. Nonetheless, we need not take the metaphor of the mirror quite\nso literally; rather, our beloveds can reflect our selves not through\ntheir inherent similarity to us but rather through the interpretations\nthey offer of us, both explicitly and implicitly in their responses to\nus. This is what Badhwar calls the \u201cepistemic\nsignificance\u201d of\n love.[16]\n\nIn addition to this epistemic significance of love, LaFollette (1996,\nChapter 5) offers several other reasons why it is good to love,\nreasons derived in part from the psychological literature on love:\nlove increases our sense of well-being, it elevates our sense of\nself-worth, and it serves to develop our character. It also, we might\nadd, tends to lower stress and blood pressure and to increase health\nand longevity. Friedman (1993) argues that the kind of partiality\ntowards our beloveds that love involves is itself morally\nvaluable because it supports relationships\u2014loving\nrelationships\u2014that contribute \u201cto human well-being,\nintegrity, and fulfillment in life\u201d (p. 61). And Solomon (1988,\np. 155) claims:\n\nUltimately, there is only one reason for love. That one grand\nreason\u2026is \u201cbecause we bring out the best in each\nother.\u201d What counts as \u201cthe best,\u201d of course, is\nsubject to much individual variation.\n\n\nThis is because, Solomon suggests, in loving someone, I want myself to\nbe better so as to be worthy of his love for me.\n\nEach of these answers to the question of why we love understands it to\nbe asking about love quite generally, abstracted away from details of\nparticular relationships. It is also possible to understand the\nquestion as asking about particular loves. Here, there are several\nquestions that are relevant:\n\nWhat, if anything, justifies my loving rather than not loving this particular person?\nWhat, if anything, justifies my coming to love this particular person rather than someone else?\nWhat, if anything, justifies my continuing to love this particular person given the changes\u2014both in him and me and in the overall circumstances\u2014that have occurred since I began loving him?\n\n\nThese are importantly different questions. Velleman (1999), for\nexample, thinks we can answer (1) by appealing to the fact that my\nbeloved is a person and so has a rational nature, yet he thinks (2)\nand (3) have no answers: the best we can do is offer causal\nexplanations for our loving particular people, a position echoed by\nHan (2021). Setiya (2014) similarly thinks (1) has an answer, but\npoints not to the rational nature of persons but rather to the\nother\u2019s humanity, where such humanity differs from\npersonhood in that not all humans need have the requisite rational\nnature for personhood, and not all persons need be humans. And, as\nwill become clear\n below,\n the distinction between (2) and (3) will become important in\nresolving puzzles concerning whether our beloveds are fungible, though\nit should be clear that (3) potentially raises questions concerning\n personal identity\n (which will not be addressed here).\n\nIt is important not to misconstrue these justificatory questions.\n Thomas (1991),\n for example, rejects the idea that love can be justified:\n\u201cthere are no rational considerations whereby anyone can lay\nclaim to another\u2019s love or insist that an individual\u2019s\nlove for another is irrational\u201d (p. 474). This is because,\nThomas claims (p. 471):\n\nno matter how wonderful and lovely an individual might be, on any and\nall accounts, it is simply false that a romantically unencumbered\nperson must love that individual on pain of being irrational. Or,\nthere is no irrationality involved in ceasing to love a person whom\none once loved immensely, although the person has not changed.\n\n\nHowever, as LaFollette (1996, p. 63) correctly points out,\n\nreason is not some external power which dictates how we should behave,\nbut an internal power, integral to who we are.\u2026 Reason does not\ncommand that we love anyone. Nonetheless, reason is vital in\ndetermining whom we love and why we love them.\n\n\nThat is, reasons for love are pro tanto: they are a part of\nthe overall reasons we have for acting, and it is up to us in\nexercising our capacity for agency to decide what on balance we have\nreason to do or even whether we shall act contrary to our reasons. To\nconstrue the notion of a reason for love as compelling us to love, as\nThomas does, is to misconstrue the place such reasons have within our\n agency.[17]\n\nMost philosophical discussions of the justification of love focus on\nquestion\n (1),\n thinking that answering this question will also, to the extent that\nwe can, answer question\n (2),\n which is typically not distinguished from\n (3).\n The answers given to these questions vary in a way that turns on how\nthe kind of evaluation implicit in love is construed. On the one hand,\nthose who understand the evaluation implicit in love to be a matter of\nthe bestowal of value (such as Telfer 1970\u201371; Friedman 1993;\nSinger 1994) typically claim that no justification can be given (cf.\n Section 4.2).\n As indicated above, this seems problematic, especially given the\nimportance love can have both in our lives and, especially, in shaping\nour identities as persons. To reject the idea that we can love for\nreasons may reduce the impact our agency can have in defining who we\nare.\n\nOn the other hand, those who understand the evaluation implicit in\nlove to be a matter of appraisal tend to answer the justificatory\nquestion by appeal to these valuable properties of the beloved. This\nacceptance of the idea that love can be justified leads to two\nfurther, related worries about the object of love.\n\nThe\n first worry is raised by Vlastos (1981) in a discussion Plato\u2019s\nand Aristotle\u2019s accounts of love. Vlastos notes that these\naccounts focus on the properties of our beloveds: we are to\nlove people, they say, only because and insofar as they are\nobjectifications of the excellences. Consequently, he argues, in doing\nso they fail to distinguish \u201cdisinterested\naffection for the person we love\u201d from\n\u201cappreciation of the excellences instantiated by that\nperson\u201d (p. 33). That is, Vlastos thinks that Plato and\nAristotle provide an account of love that is really a love of\nproperties rather than a love of persons\u2014love of a type\nof person, rather than love of a particular person\u2014thereby\nlosing what is distinctive about love as an essentially\npersonal attitude. This worry about Plato and Aristotle might\nseem to apply just as well to other accounts that justify love in\nterms of the properties of the person: insofar as we love the person\nfor the sake of her properties, it might seem that what we love is\nthose properties and not the person. Here it is surely insufficient to\nsay, as Solomon (1988, p. 154) does, \u201cif love has its reasons,\nthen it is not the whole person that one loves but certain aspects of\nthat person\u2014though the rest of the person comes along too, of\ncourse\u201d: that final tagline fails to address the central\ndifficulty about what the object of love is and so about love as a\ndistinctly personal attitude. (Clausen 2019 might seem to address this\nworry by arguing that we love people not as having certain properties\nbut rather as having \u201corganic unities\u201d: a\nholistic set of properties the value of each of which must be\nunderstood in essential part in terms of its place within that whole.\nNonetheless, while this is an interesting and plausible way to think\nabout the value of the properties of persons, that organic unity\nitself will be a (holistic) property held by the person, and it seems\nthat the fundamental problem reemerges at the level of this holistic\nproperty: do we love the holistic unity rather than the person?)\n\nThe second worry concerns the fungibility of the object of love. To be\nfungible is to be replaceable by another relevantly similar\nobject without any loss of value. Thus, money is fungible: I can give\nyou two $5 bills in exchange for a $10 bill, and neither of us has\nlost anything. Is the object of love fungible? That is, can I simply\nswitch from loving one person to loving another relevantly similar\nperson without any loss? The worry about fungibility is commonly put\nthis way: if we accept that love can be justified by appealing to\nproperties of the beloved, then it may seem that in loving someone for\ncertain reasons, I love him not simply as the individual he is, but as\ninstantiating those properties. And this may imply that any other\nperson instantiating those same properties would do just as well: my\nbeloved would be fungible. Indeed, it may be that another person\nexhibits the properties that ground my love to a greater degree than\nmy current beloved does, and so it may seem that in such a case I have\nreason to \u201ctrade up\u201d\u2014to switch my love to the new,\nbetter person. However, it seems clear that the objects of our loves\nare not fungible: love seems to involve a deeply personal commitment\nto a particular person, a commitment that is antithetical to the idea\nthat our beloveds are fungible or to the idea that we ought to be\nwilling to trade up when\n possible.[18]\n\nIn\n responding to these worries, Nozick (1989) appeals to the union view\nof love he endorses (see the section on\n Love as Union):\n\nThe intention in love is to form a we and to identify with it\nas an extended self, to identify one\u2019s fortunes in large part\nwith its fortunes. A willingness to trade up, to destroy the very\nwe you largely identify with, would then be a willingness to\ndestroy your self in the form of your own extended self. [p. 78]\n\n\nSo it is because love involves forming a \u201cwe\u201d that we must\nunderstand other persons and not properties to be the objects of love,\nand it is because my very identity as a person depends essentially on\nthat \u201cwe\u201d that it is not possible to substitute without\nloss one object of my love for another. However, Badhwar (2003)\ncriticizes Nozick, saying that his response implies that once I love\nsomeone, I cannot abandon that love no matter who that person becomes;\nthis, she says, \u201ccannot be understood as love at all rather than\naddiction\u201d (p.\n 61).[19]\n\nInstead, Badhwar (1987) turns to her robust-concern account of love as\na concern for the beloved for his sake rather than\none\u2019s own. Insofar as my love is disinterested \u2014\nnot a means to antecedent ends of my own\u2014it would be senseless\nto think that my beloved could be replaced by someone who is able to\nsatisfy my ends equally well or better. Consequently, my beloved is in\nthis way irreplaceable. However, this is only a partial response to\nthe worry about fungibility, as Badhwar herself seems to acknowledge.\nFor the concern over fungibility arises not merely for those cases in\nwhich we think of love as justified instrumentally, but also for those\ncases in which the love is justified by the intrinsic value of the\nproperties of my beloved. Confronted with cases like this, Badhwar\n(2003) concludes that the object of love is fungible after all (though\nshe insists that it is very unlikely in practice). (Soble (1990,\nChapter 13) draws similar conclusions.)\n\nNonetheless, Badhwar thinks that the object of love is\n\u201cphenomenologically non-fungible\u201d (2003, p. 63; see also\n1987, p. 14). By this she means that we experience our\nbeloveds to be irreplaceable: \u201cloving and delighting in [one\nperson] are not completely commensurate with loving and delighting in\nanother\u201d (1987, p. 14). Love can be such that we sometimes\ndesire to be with this particular person whom we love, not another\nwhom we also love, for our loves are qualitatively different. But why\nis this? It seems as though the typical reason I now want to spend\ntime with Amy rather than Bob is, for example, that Amy is funny but\nBob is not. I love Amy in part for her humor, and I love Bob for other\nreasons, and these qualitative differences between them is what makes\nthem not fungible. However, this reply does not address the worry\nabout the possibility of trading up: if Bob were to be at least as\nfunny (charming, kind, etc.) as Amy, why shouldn\u2019t I dump her\nand spend all my time with him?\n\nA somewhat different approach is taken by Whiting (1991). In response\nto the first worry concerning the object of love, Whiting argues that\nVlastos offers a false dichotomy: having affection for someone that is\ndisinterested\u2014for her sake rather than my\nown\u2014essentially involves an appreciation of her excellences as\nsuch. Indeed, Whiting says, my appreciation of these as excellences,\nand so the underlying commitment I have to their value, just\nis a disinterested commitment to her because these\nexcellences constitute her identity as the person she is. The person,\ntherefore, really is the object of love. Delaney (1996) takes the\ncomplementary tack of distinguishing between the object of\none\u2019s love, which of course is the person, and the\ngrounds of the love, which are her properties: to say, as\nSolomon does, that we love someone for reasons is not at all to say\nthat we only love certain aspects of the person. In these terms, we\nmight say that Whiting\u2019s rejection of Vlastos\u2019 dichotomy\ncan be read as saying that what makes my attitude be one of\ndisinterested affection\u2014one of love\u2014for the\nperson is precisely that I am thereby responding to her excellences as\nthe reasons for that\n affection.[20]\n\nOf course, more needs to be said about what it is that makes a\nparticular person be the object of love. Implicit in Whiting\u2019s\naccount is an understanding of the way in which the object of my love\nis determined in part by the history of interactions I have with her:\nit is she, and not merely her properties (which might be instantiated\nin many different people), that I want to be with; it is she, and not\nmerely her properties, on whose behalf I am concerned when she suffers\nand whom I seek to comfort; etc. This addresses the first worry, but\nnot the second worry about fungibility, for the question still remains\nwhether she is the object of my love only as instantiating certain\nproperties, and so whether or not I have reason to \u201ctrade\nup.\u201d\n\nTo\n respond to the fungibility worry, Whiting and Delaney appeal\nexplicitly to the historical\n relationship.[21]\n Thus, Whiting claims, although there may be a relatively large pool\nof people who have the kind of excellences of character that would\njustify my loving them, and so although there can be no answer to\nquestion\n (2)\n about why I come to love this rather than that person within this\npool, once I have come to love this person and so have developed a\nhistorical relation with her, this history of concern justifies my\ncontinuing to love this person rather than someone else (1991, p. 7).\nSimilarly, Delaney claims that love is grounded in\n\u201chistorical-relational properties\u201d (1996, p. 346), so that\nI have reasons for continuing to love this person rather than\nswitching allegiances and loving someone else. In each case, the\nappeal to both such historical relations and the excellences of\ncharacter of my beloved is intended to provide an answer to question\n (3),\n and this explains why the objects of love are not fungible.\n\nThere seems to be something very much right with this response.\nRelationships grounded in love are essentially personal, and it would\nbe odd to think of what justifies that love to be merely\nnon-relational properties of the beloved. Nonetheless, it is still\nunclear how the historical-relational propreties can provide any\nadditional justification for subsequent concern beyond that which is\nalready provided (as an answer to question\n (1))\n by appeal to the excellences of the beloved\u2019s character (cf.\nBrink 1999). The mere fact that I have loved someone in the past does\nnot seem to justify my continuing to love him in the future.\nWhen we imagine that he is going through a rough time and begins to\nlose the virtues justifying my initial love for him, why\nshouldn\u2019t I dump him and instead come to love someone new having\nall of those virtues more fully? Intuitively (unless the change she\nundergoes makes her in some important sense no longer the same person\nhe was), we think I should not dump him, but the appeal to the mere\nfact that I loved him in the past is surely not enough. Yet what\nhistorical-relational properties could do the trick? (For an\ninteresting attempt at an answer, see Kolodny 2003 and also Howard\n2019.)\n\nIf we think that love can be justified, then it may seem that the\nappeal to particular historical facts about a loving relationship to\njustify that love is inadequate, for such idiosyncratic and subjective\nproperties might explain but cannot justify love.\nRather, it may seem, justification in general requires appealing to\nuniversal, objective properties. But such properties are ones that\nothers might share, which leads to the problem of fungibility.\nConsequently it may seem that love cannot be justified. In the face of\nthis predicament, accounts of love that understand love to be an\nattitude towards value that is intermediate between appraisal and\nbestowal, between recognizing already existing value and creating that\nvalue (see\n Section 4.3)\n might seem to offer a way out. For once we reject the thought that\nthe value of our beloveds must be either the precondition or the\nconsequence of our love, we have room to acknowledge that the deeply\npersonal, historically grounded, creative nature of love (central to\nbestowal accounts) and the understanding of love as responsive to\nvaluable properties of the beloved that can justify that love (central\nto appraisal accounts) are not mutually exclusive (Helm 2010; Bagley\n2015).\n",
