    "main_text": "Epistemology\n9. Epistemology\n\nWilliam James asked: \u201cDo mystical states establish the truth\nof those theological affections in which the saintly life has its\nroots?\u201d (1958, 415). This question can be divided into two: (Q1)\nIs a mystic warranted in thinking that his or her experiences are\nveridical or have evidential value? A mystical experience may be\npsychologically compelling for the person who had it, but is it also\ncognitively authoritative? And (Q2), are those who have not\nundergone any mystical experience, upon examining the evidence\npresented by mystics, warranted in thinking them veridical or endowed\nwith evidential value? The major philosophical reply in the\naffirmative to Q1 is called the \u201cDoxastic Practice Approach.\u201d The\nmajor defense of an affirmative reply to Q2 is called the\n\u201cArgument from Experience.\u201d\n",
