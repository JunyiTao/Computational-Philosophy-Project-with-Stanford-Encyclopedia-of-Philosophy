    "main_text": "Methods in Nishida\u2019s Thought\n7. Methods in Nishida\u2019s Thought\n\n\nNishida composed essays on interrelated themes rather than sequential\nand tightly edited books. Major essays were subsequently collected and\npublished as books, but often do not form chapters of a single\ncoherent work. Instead of investigating a problem in a series of\nstraightforward linear arguments, he tended to write in spirals that\nkept circling back on previous formulations and reworking them in new\ncontexts. His style is akin to the manner in which one repeatedly\npractices a traditional Japanese art like calligraphy, poetry or even\nZen mediation: working at a particular activity or expression, getting\nbetter and better at it without erasing one\u2019s previous attempts. It is\npossible, however, to discern four methods that pervade his philosophy\nand make it easier for the reader to follow the train of his\nthought.\n\n\nFirst is Nishida\u2019s way of taking the more inclusive as the more\nconcrete, and the more restricted as the more abstract. This makes\nsense insofar as abstraction involves removal of parts, but Nishida\nalso uses this method to reverse the usual order of things in\nexplanatory schemas or hierarchies. As mentioned earlier, the historical world lived by\nhuman beings, for example, is more concrete than the material world\nstudied by physics since the historical, human world comprehends (in\nboth senses of the word) the merely physical and can never be reduced\nto it. Between these two worlds is the biological realm of life\nforms, less concrete than the human world but more concrete than the\nphysical world.\n\n\nSecond is Nishida\u2019s recourse to the explanatory schema of wholes that\nreflect themselves in their parts. Here Nishida adapts the idea of\nself-representative systems presented in Josiah Royce and in Richard\nDedekind\u2019s idea of an infinite system reflected in its parts. For\nNishida, if there are no parts outside a whole, its evident\ndifferentiation must be explained.  After his first major book, An\nInquiry into the Good, Nishida came to explain this\ndifferentiating development not in terms of a temporal process but as\nthe self-reflective or self-mirroring structure of a whole. Knowledge,\nfor example, is not a matter of two disparate realities, a knowing\nmind and a known object, conforming to one another, but a single\nconcrete reality that \u201creflects itself in itself\u201d on\ndiffering levels that give rise to the more abstract notions of\nknowing subject and known objects. And after Nishida described\nself-awareness (jikaku) as the activity of self reflecting\nitself within itself, he came to speak of other structural wholes,\nincluding place or topos and even the world itself, as\n\u201cself-aware\u201d (jikaku-teki) insofar as they\nreflected themselves within themselves.\n\n\nThird is\nNishida\u2019s way of elaborating this \u201cwithin\u201d in terms of\nenfolding or enwrapping, as a whole enfolds or contains parts that\npartially reflect it , or as the universal of color encompasses that of\nred, for example.  Nishida also referred to more limited realms as\nparticularizations or \u201cself-determinations\u201d of more\ninclusive realms, but he often used the metaphor of wrapping to\ndescribe the manner of determination. The ultimate universal or\nenfolding whole has no determinate features; it is\n\u201cnothingness\u201d (mu).\n\n\nThe fourth method is Nishida\u2019s way of treating oppositions and\ndistinctions, emphasizing alternatively their undifferentiated ground\nor their irreducible relation. He often sought to return (not reduce) oppositions\nand distinctions to the non-differentiated condition that underlies\nthem, ultimately to the nothingness that gives rise to (or determines\nitself as) various distinctions. Although terms translating as\n\u201cground\u201d or \u201cfoundation\u201d are found throughout\nhis works, this emphasis undermines any recourse to a founding\nprinciple or entity wholly transcendent to, and thus ultimately\ndifferent from, the world or reality. \u201cAbsolute\nnothingness\u201d may be understood as the lack of any positively\ndefinable transcendent ground. When for example Nishida writes\n\u201cabsolute nothingness transcends all that is, but at the same\ntime all that is arises through it\u201d (NKZ IX, 6), we may\ninterpret him as pointing to an undifferentiated source beyond the\ndistinctions it gives rise to, a source that is necessarily entailed\nby their being brought together precisely as distinct from one\nanother.\n\n\nThe emphasis on relation similarly undermines any attempt to reduce\nopposed or distinguished terms to some element common to both. In mid\ncareer Nishida used the language of dialectics to describe relations,\nwhile insisting that the opposed terms were not sublated into a higher\nunity. Later he used expressions like \u201cthe self-identity of\nabsolute contradictories\u201d to describe the way in which opposed\nterms are held together, the many and the one for example. His notion\nof an \u201cinverse correlation\u201d also reflects this method.\nNishida\u2019s emphasis on relation modifies his notion of self-reflective\nstructures to make it clear that they maintain difference within a\nwhole and are not simply self-replicating or recursive. This is\nnoticeable in his last essay, for example, when he describes\nindividual selves as focal points where world reflects itself in\nitself (NKZ XI, 378). His rejection of a positive foundation or\nsubstratum, and his insistence on irreducible but inseparable terms in\nrelation, explain why the holistic tendency evident in his methodology\ndoes not devolve into a simple monism, and why many commentators refer\nto his philosophy as non-dualist instead.\n",
