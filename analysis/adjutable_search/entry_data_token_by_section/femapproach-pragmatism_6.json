    "main_text": "Pragmatist Feminist Philosophical Themes || Social Action\n3.4 Social Action\n\nEarly feminist pragmatists often influenced the intellectual culture\nof the Progressive Era and early pragmatist thought through activism.\nWhile early feminist pragmatists were influenced by Darwinian thought,\nthey rejected the harsh position of Social Darwinism that pits humans\nin a competitive fight for individual survival. Instead, they used the\nconcepts of evolution to theorize the possibilities of social\nprogress, affirming a social ethic that mandates humans have both the\nability and the responsibility to improve their environment. Charlotte\nPerkins Gilman, for example, concentrated much of her writing on\nsocial issues of women\u2019s environment, working towards radical\nchanges in the home environment to make it more democratic and\negalitarian. Gilman\u2019s writing recommended some Hull House\ninnovations as examples of some of the social changes she recommended,\nsuch as having professional cooks making healthy family meals in a\npublic kitchen, instituting day care centers, and abolishing\nindustrial child labor. Addams was also quite perceptive about the\nperplexities of home life for women; in Democracy and Social\nEthics, she consistently advocated that the private home life of\nwomen should more directly align with a public social good.\n\nAddams\u2019s life work\u2014involving both place-based local\nactivism and global outreach\u2014is a powerful illustration of\nenacting experimental values under specific conditions through an\niterative process of concrete experience and reflective\ntheorizing. Rather than a philosophic retreat from the events and\ntextures of everyday life, feminist pragmatists have chosen to do\nphilosophy in an interactive and public mode. Marilyn Fischer\ndescribes Addams\u2019s activism and writing as \u201can experiment\nin real time of the process of democratic, pragmatist political\nreconstruction\u201d. She continues by labeling her activism as the\n\u201cthe sort of concrete experience from which pragmatist theory\nemerges and to which it must return for validation\u201d (2013: 229).\nIn Jane Addams\u2019s Evolutionary Theorizing: Constructing\nDemocracy and Social Ethics (2019), Fischer shows that Addams, in\nanalyzing the most pressing social issues of her day, drew on a vast\narray of international intellectual resources, most notably from\ntheorists across the disciplines who patterned their work on\nevolutionary biology. By showing that Addams was a more wide-ranging\nintellectual than has been documented to date, Fischer\u2019s work\nalso expands our understanding of the roots of classical American\npragmatism.\n\nPeace activism is a field of social activism that engaged many of the\nwomen of the early progressive pragmatist era. Starting with the\nSpanish American War of 1899 and in the decades prior to World War I,\npragmatists and feminists worked on anti-imperialist campaigns and\nfought militarist influences in society. After the beginnings of the\nwar in Europe, political activism in opposition to war and working for\nalternatives to war became, for some women, their primary occupation.\nYet, for most of these activists, \u201cpeace\u201d was much more\nthat the absence of war; instead it signaled a new cooperative\napproach to social life. As noted early, Jane Addams and Emily Greene\nBalch both received the Nobel Peace Prize (Addams in 1931, Balch in\n1946). Addams and Balch were also founding members of Women\u2019s\nInternational League for Peace and Freedom, an organization which\ncontinues to be internationally influential in gender justice\nwork.\n\nIn the early 20th century peace activism and women\u2019s\nsuffrage movements were often linked. For these women, the movement\ntoward social justice, toward egalitarian economic structures, and\naway from competitive hierarchies necessitated a social structure\nbased in cooperation and peace, not war. Such belief in the\npossibility of substantially changing social and political realities\nis at the heart of both pragmatism and feminism. Contemporary scholars\nof peace, such as political scientist Patricia M. Shields, draw on\nAddams\u2019s philosophy of \u201c positive peace\u201d which\nincludes advocacy for social justice at all levels of society and\ngovernance (2017: 37). \n\nTwenty-first century feminist pragmatists also have expanded the\nphilosophies of early pragmatists feminists by bringing new activist\nvoices into the philosophic dialogue such as Gloria Anzuldua, Grace\nLee Boggs, bell hooks, Audre Lorde and Angela Davis (see Lake 2019,\n2020; McKenna and Pratt 2015; James 2009, 2013; Varner 2020 (Other\nInternet Resources)).  A number of contemporary feminist pragmatists\n(Heldke, Lake, McKenna, Parker) are advocating for ecological justice,\nfood justice, and animal justice.  Others are looking to scholars of\nwicked problems like Valerie Brown and Bryan Norton, and Design and\nSystems Thinking experts like Margaret Wheatley, Josina Vink, and\nArturo Escobar for new ways to address social problems.\n\nAsian American Civil Rights activist Grace Lee Boggs (1915\u20132015)\nhas received particular attention in recent years from pragmatist\nfeminists who have found Boggs\u2019s emphases on lived experience,\npluralism, complexity, and praxis to align with pragmatist feminist\ntraditions (Lake 2020). Boggs\u2019 place-based philosophic-activism\nin Detroit was preceded by formal philosophical training in\npragmatism. She received her 1940 Ph.D. in philosophy (see Grace Chin\nLee) from Bryn Mawr where she wrote her dissertation on pragmatist\nGeorge Herbert Mead. \n",
