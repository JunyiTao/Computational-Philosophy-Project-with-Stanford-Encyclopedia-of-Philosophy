    "main_text": "Three structuralist programs || Scheibe\u2019s program\n5.3 Scheibe\u2019s program\n\nThe German philosopher Erhard Scheibe (1927\u20132010) has published\nseveral books and numerous essays on various topics of philosophy of\nscience; see, for example, Scheibe (2001). He has often commented on\nthe programs of Sneed and Ludwig, such as in his \u201cComparison of\ntwo recent views on theories\u201d, reprinted in Scheibe (2001,\n175\u2013194). Moreover, he published one of the earliest case\nstudies of approximate theory reduction; see Scheibe 2001\n(306\u2013323) for the 1973 case study.\n\nIn his books on \u201creduction of physical theories,\u201d Scheibe\n(1997, 1999) developed his own concept of theory, which to some extent\ncan be considered an intermediate position between those of Ludwig and\nSneed. For example, he conveniently combines the model-theoretical and\nsyntactical styles of Sneed and Ludwig, respectively. Since his main\nconcern is reduction, he does not need to cover all the aspects of\nphysical theories that are treated in the other approaches. As already\nmentioned, he proposes a more flexible concept of reduction that is\nopen to extensions arising from new case studies.\n\nA unique feature of Scheibe\u2019s approach is the thorough\ndiscussion of almost all the important cases of reduction considered\nin the physical literature. These include classical vs.\nspecial-relativistic spacetime, Newtonian gravitation vs. general\nrelativity, thermodynamics vs. kinetic theory, and classical vs.\nquantum mechanics. He essentially arrives at the conclusion of a\ndouble incompleteness: the attempts of the physicists to prove\nreduction relations in the above cases are largely incomplete\naccording to their own standards, as well as according to the\nrequirements of a structuralistic concept of reduction. But this\nconcept is also not complete, Scheibe argues, since, for example, a\nsatisfactory understanding of \u201ccounter-factual\u201d limiting\nprocesses such as \\(\\hslash \\rightarrow 0\\) or \\(c\\rightarrow \\infty\\)\nhas not yet been developed. Bolinger in his (2016) gives a fairly\ngeneral account of the structuralistic programme with special emphasis\non Scheibe\u2019s work.\n",
