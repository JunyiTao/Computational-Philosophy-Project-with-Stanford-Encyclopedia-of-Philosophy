    "main_text": "Civil and Canon Law || Natural Law and Natural Rights\n6.1 Natural Law and Natural Rights\n\nComplex reflections on natural law were prompted by a text of Isidore\nof Seville (quoted in D. 1 c. 7; Gratian 1993: 6\u20137). According\nto Isidore, natural law includes \n\n\nthe common possession of all things, the one liberty of all, and the\nacquisition of what is taken from air, land and sea; also, the\nrestitution of a thing or money left for safekeeping. \n\n\nThe common possession of all things seems inconsistent with the\nacquisition and restitution of property.\n\nOne of the early commentators on Gratian, Rufinus, distinguished\nwithin natural law between commands or prohibitions, to which there\ncan be no exceptions, and \u201cindications\u201d\n(demonstrationes) pointing out what is better but not always\nobligatory. Thus natural law not only lays down rules but also\nrecommends ideals. The \u201cone liberty of all men\u201d and\n\u201ccommon possession of all things\u201d belong to the\n\u201cindications\u201d. Since the indications do not impose strict\nobligations, human laws can for good reasons set them aside. To do so\nmay even serve the recommended ideals, under some circumstances. \n\n\nFor example\u2026 it was established that those who pertinaciously\nrebelled against those who have authority over them would be\nperpetually slaves when defeated and captured in war\u2026 that\n[they]\u2026 should thereafter become gentle\u2026 \n\n\n\u2014a purpose recommended by natural law (trans. Lewis 1954: vol.\n1, 38; see Tierney 2014: 23\u20138).\n\nOne of the founders of Franciscan theology, Alexander of Hales,\nreported Rufinus\u2019s distinction and a similar distinction by Hugh\nof St Victor (Alexander of Hales [c. 1240] 1948: vol. 4, 348,\n351\u20132) but also suggested another way of resolving the\ninconsistency in Isidore\u2019s list, based on Augustine\u2019s\nexplanation of how the same God can be the author of the Old Law and\nof the New: namely, that the same principles may require different\nparticular rules for different\n circumstances.[34]\n According to Alexander, Isidore\u2019s list is not inconsistent\nafter all, since natural law prescribes community for the state of\ninnocence and respect for property for the fallen\n state.[35]\n The leading Franciscan theologian of the next generation,\nBonaventure, adopted a similar\n position.[36]\n\n\nBuilding on these ideas, Ockham developed a distinction between three\nkinds of natural law, according to which some principles of natural\nlaw apply everywhere and always, some applied only in the state of\ninnocence, and some apply only \u201con supposition\u201d, viz. on\nthe supposition of some voluntary act (e.g., an agreement or an act of\nlegislation), unless those concerned agree on something else. Thus\n\u201cthe common possession of all things, the one liberty of\nall\u201d belonged to the natural law in the state of innocence, but\n\u201cthe acquisition of what is taken from air, land and sea; also,\nthe restitution of a thing or money left for safekeeping\u201d\nbelonged to natural law \u201con supposition\u201d\u2014supposing\nAdam\u2019s sin, and supposing that human law has since made a\ndivision of property, it is a requirement of natural law to respect\nothers\u2019 property (William of Ockham, Letter:\n286\u201393; commentary in Kilcullen 2001a, Tierney 2014:\n103\u201316). Many things that belong to the law of nations are also\nnatural laws of the third kind.\n\nBesides natural law, scholastic thinkers developed a notion of natural\nrights, borrowing the notion of a right from the canon lawyers. A\nnatural right may be simply something that natural law requires or\npermits. But according to some, natural rights to certain freedoms\nbelong to natural law \u201cpositively\u201d, in the sense that\nthere is a presumption in their favour, so that they cannot be\nabolished, at least not for all circumstances, or cannot be abolished\nexcept for good reasons. Medieval natural rights foreshadow modern\n\u201chuman rights\u201d (Tierney 1997; M\u00e4kinen and Korkman\n2006; M\u00e4kinen 2010; Kilcullen 2010c,d; and Robinson 2014a).\n",
