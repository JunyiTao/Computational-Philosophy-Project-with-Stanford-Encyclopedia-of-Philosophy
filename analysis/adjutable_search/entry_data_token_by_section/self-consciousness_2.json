    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in the History of Philosophy || Early Modern Discussions of Self-Consciousness\n1.2 Early Modern Discussions of Self-Consciousness\n\nCentral to the early modern discussion of self-consciousness are\nDescartes\u2019 assertions, in the second of his\nMeditations, that \u201cI am, I exist, is\nnecessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my\nmind\u201d (Descartes 1641: 80), and, in both his Discourse\nand Principles, that \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d,\nor \u201ccogito ergo sum\u201d (Descartes 1637: 36, and\nDescartes 1644: 162; see the discussion of Reflection in the entry on\n seventeenth century theories of consciousness).\n The cogito, which was anticipated by Augustine (On the\nTrinity 10.10; Pasnau 2002: ch. 11), embodies two elements of\nself-awareness\u2014awareness that one is thinking and awareness that\none exists\u2014that play a foundational role in Descartes\u2019\nepistemological project. As such, it is crucial for Descartes that the\ncogito is something of which we can be absolutely certain.\nBut whilst most commentators are happy to agree that both \u201cI am\nthinking\u201d and \u201cI exist\u201d are indubitable, there is a\ngreat deal of debate over the grounds for such certainty and over the\nform of the cogito itself (Hintikka 1962; Wilson 1978: ch. 2, \u00a72;\nB. Williams 1978: ch. 3; Markie 1992). Of particular concern is the\nquestion whether these two propositions are known by inference or\nnon-inferentially, e.g., by intuition, an issue that echoes the\nmedieval debates concerning whether one can be said to perceive\noneself.\n\nOne philosopher who accepts the former, intuition-based, account is\nLocke, who claims that \n\n\nwe have an intuitive Knowledge of our own Existence, and an\ninternal infallible Perception that we are. In every Act of Sensation,\nReasoning, or Thinking, we are conscious to ourselves of our own\nBeing. (1700: IV.ix.3) \n\n\nA similar claim can be found in Berkeley\u2019s Three\nDialogues (1713: 231\u2013234; Stoneham 2002: \u00a76.4).\nFurther, Locke makes self-consciousness partly definitive of the very\nconcept of a person, a person being \u201ca thinking intelligent\nBeing, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as it\nself, the same thinking thing in different times and places\u201d\n(1700: II. xxvii.9; Ayers 1991: vol.II, ch.23; Thiel 2011: ch. 4), and\nself-consciousness also plays an important role in his theory of\npersonal identity (see\n \u00a74.1).\n\nIf Descartes, Locke, and Berkeley can be interpreted as accepting the\nview that there is an inner perception of the self, on this question\nHume stands in stark contrast notoriously writing that whilst \n\n\nthere are some philosophers, who imagine we are every moment\nintimately conscious of what we call our self [\u2026] For my part\nwhen I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I\nalways stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or\ncold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can\ncatch myself at any time without a perception, and never can\nobserve anything but the perception. (Hume 1739\u201340: bk.1, ch.4,\n\u00a76; Pitson 2002: ch. 1; Thiel 2011: ch. 12; cf.\nLichtenberg\u2019s famous remark that one should not say \u201cI\nthink\u201d but rather, \u201cit thinks\u201d, discussed in\nZ\u00f6ller 1992 and Burge 1998) \n\n\nHume\u2019s view that there is no impression, or perception, of\noneself is crucial to his case for the understanding of our idea of\nourselves as nothing more than a \u201cheap or collection of\ndifferent perceptions\u201d (1739\u201340: bk.1, ch.4, \u00a76;\nPenelhum 2000; G. Strawson 2011a), since lacking an impression of the\nowner of these perceptions we must, in accordance with his empiricist\naccount of concept acquisition, lack an idea of such. It is clear,\nthen, that in the early modern period issues of self-consciousness\nplay an important role in a variety of philosophical questions\nregarding persons and their minds.\n",
