    "main_text": "Defining Culture || Culture-as-social-formation\n1.2 Culture-as-social-formation\n\nOne attempt to reconceive culture in a way that responds to the\nessentialist challenge, but which retains a view of culture as largely\nencompassing, proposes that cultures are defined by their\nmembers\u2019 shared experience of social formation (Patten\n2014: 39). On this \u201csocial lineage\u201d account of culture,\nwhat makes a culture is that its members are subject to a\n\u201cset of formative conditions that are distinct from the\nformative conditions that are imposed on others\u201d (Patten 2014:\n51). The experience of being subjected to common institutions,\nunderstood broadly to include shared educational spaces, languages,\nmedia, as well as shared historical traditions and stories,\noverlapping familial structures, and so on, shapes a sense among\ncultural group members that they share a distinct way of seeing the\nworld, and that certain assumptions that they possess are shared by,\nor at least understood by, others. This view emphasizes a\nculture\u2019s historical trajectory, but does not require that its\ndefining norms, values and practices are unchanging over time. On the\ncontrary,\n\n\ninternal variation is possible because subjection to a common set of\nformative influences does not imply that people will end up with a\nhomogeneous set of beliefs or values. (Patten 2014: 52)\n\n\nAs a result, cultures are sites in which members can contest and\ndeliberate their meaning with enough shared assumptions about\nthe way the world works that they can recognize each other as engaged\nin the same project.\n\nPatten writes of the institutions to which cultural group members are\nsubject that they are at least to some degree \u201cisolated from the\ninstitutions and practices that work to socialize outsiders\u201d\n(Patten 2014: 52), and thus serve to distinguish one culture from\nanother. On this view, significant emphasis is placed on who is\ncontrolling the levers of the institutions that shape members\u2019\nformation: that is, it matters that members are in control of\nthe institutions to which they, themselves,\u00a0are subject, so that\nthey can plausibly shape their own social experience, and the\nexperience of younger members, in fundamental ways. Where the control\nover this social formation is denied, a culture\u2019s members are\nthereby harmed; when it is coercively denied, there is very likely an\ninjustice demanding remedy.\n\nBy focusing on the shared experience of subjection to common cultural\ninstitutions, this account avoids the accusation that what defines a\nculture is the stability of its basic norms and values over time:\nculture is not, on this view, a static entity. Instead, what matters\nis that cultural group members believe themselves to be members of a\ncultural group, and that this belief\u2019s foundation is\u00a0in the\nexperience of common cultural institutions, rather than in the\nspecific practices that are central to the group. These central\npractices can change fundamentally, without the cultural group itself\ndissolving. However, this view is subject to criticism by scholars who\nworry that those who control the levers of formation do not represent\nthe views of all members (Phillips 2018), that instead they are using\ntheir relative positions of power to create and enforce cultural norms\nand practices that do not command (or would not command, without\ncoercion) widespread agreement.\n",
