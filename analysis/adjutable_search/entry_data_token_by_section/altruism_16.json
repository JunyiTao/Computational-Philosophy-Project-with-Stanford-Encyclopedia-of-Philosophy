    "main_text": "Why care about others? || Nagel and the impersonal standpoint\n4.3 Nagel and the impersonal standpoint\n\nYet another conception of impartiality\u2014and a novel argument for\nthe rationality of altruism\u2014can be found in the work of Thomas\nNagel. In The Possibility of Altruism (1970), he seeks to\nundermine both psychological egoism, in its strong form, as defined in\n section 2.1\n above, and its normative counterpart (sometimes called\n\u201crational egoism or \u201cethical egoism\u201d), which holds\nthat one ought to have no direct concern with the good of\nothers. Indirect concern, the ethical egoist grants, can be\njustified: the good of others may be instrumental to one\u2019s own\ngood, or one might happen to have a sentimental attachment to others.\nBut absent these contingent relations to others, one has, according to\nthe ethical egoist, no reason to care about their well-being.\n\nNagel doubts that anyone actually is a psychological egoist (1970:\n84\u201385), but his major concern is to refute ethical egoism, by\nshowing that altruism is a rational requirement on action. His\nidea is not simply that we ought in certain circumstances to help\nothers for their sake; it is also that we are acting irrationally if\nwe do not. That is because it is required of us as rational beings to\nview ourselves and others from what Nagel calls \u201cthe impersonal\nstandpoint\u201d. As he puts it, \n\n\nto recognize others fully as persons requires a conception of oneself\nas identical with a particular, impersonally specifiable inhabitant of\nthe world, among others of a similar nature. (1970: 100)\n\n\nNagel likens the impersonal standpoint to the prudential policy of\nregarding all times in one\u2019s life as equal in importance. One\nhas reason not to be indifferent to one\u2019s future because the\npresent moment is not more reason-giving simply by virtue of being\npresent. Similarly, he holds, one has reason not to be indifferent to\nother people, because the fact that some individual is me is not more\nreason-giving simply because he is me. Terms like \u201cnow\u201d\nand \u201clater, \u201d \u201cme and not me\u201d point to no\ndifferences that make a rational difference. A time that is later\neventually becomes a time that is now; that is why it is arbitrary and\nirrational to discount the future simply because it is future. Giving\ngreater weight to someone\u2019s good because that person is me is no\nless irrational.\n\nThe \u201cimpersonal standpoint\u201d, as Nagel conceives it, is a\nview of the world from outside it, one that deprives one of\ninformation about which individual in that world one is. (It is, in\nthe phrase Nagel chose as the title of his 1986 book, The View\nFrom Nowhere.) From this perspective, one need not be a\nutilitarian or consequentialist\u2014one need not maximize the good,\nbut can abide by the constraints of principles of the right. But\ncertain principles are ruled out from the impersonal\nstandpoint: egoism is, as well as any other principle that gives one\nindividual or group a reason not shared by all others. For example, if\nsomeone has reason to avoid pain, that must be because\npain\u2014anyone\u2019s pain\u2014is to be avoided. So, it cannot\nbe the case that although I have a reason to avoid pain, others are\npermitted to be indifferent to my plight, as if that pain were not an\nobjectively bad thing, something that gives only the person who feels\nit a reason to oppose it. Nagel called such reasons\n\u201cobjective\u201d, as contrasted with \u201csubjective\u201d.\nParfit, in Reasons and Persons (1984), speaks instead of\n\u201cagent-relative\u201d and \u201cagent neutral\u201d reasons,\nand subsequently Nagel himself adopted these terms. The critique of\negoism in The Possibility of Altruism rests on the thesis\nthat all genuine reasons are agent neutral.\n\nWhat Nagel\u2019s position and utilitarianism have in common is a\nperspective that is the opposite of the self-centered world of\nrational egoism: from the point of view of this self-less perspective,\neach individual is just a tiny part of a vast universe of moral\nsubjects, each of no more importance or value than any other. Our\ncommon sense point of view, moving from our inner life looking\noutward, lulls us into a massive kind of insularity\u2014a tendency\nto downplay or ignore the fact that we are just one individual of no\ngreater importance than any other. We put ourselves at the center of\nour world, and this can only be corrected by stepping back, leaving\nout of our picture the particular individual one is, and making\ngeneral judgments about how human beings should behave towards each\nother. From this perspective, when one person ought to do something,\nsome related requirement is imposed on all others as well \u2013some\n\u201cought\u201d statement applies to each. \n\nNagel is faced with the problem of how to explain why self-interest is\nnot regularly swamped by agent-neutral reasons. If anyone\u2019s pain\nimposes on all other moral agents a requirement of some sort,\nthen one person\u2019s pain is everyone\u2019s problem. As Nagel\nsays in The View From Nowhere, (using the term\n\u201cobjective standpoint\u201d for the impersonal standpoint),\n\n\n\nwhen we take up the objective standpoint, the problem is not that\nvalues seem to disappear but that there are too many of them, coming\nfrom every life and drowning out those that arise from our own. (1986:\n147)\n\n\nIt would be consistent with this picture to add that the weight of\nreasons that derive from the situation of other people is extremely\nsmall and becomes increasingly so, as they are added together.\nTherefore, it might be said, they do not often outweigh reasons of\nself-interest. But that would be an ad hoc stipulation, and\nwould differ only slightly from the egoist\u2019s thesis that the\ngood of others has no independent weight. It is hard to\nbelieve that we are forced to choose between ethical egoism (which\nsays that only one\u2019s own pain ought to be one\u2019s direct\nconcern) and Nagel\u2019s conception of impartiality (according to\nwhich everyone\u2019s pain ought to weigh on me, because that of\nothers is as bad as my own). The first demands no altruism of us, the\nsecond too much.\n",
