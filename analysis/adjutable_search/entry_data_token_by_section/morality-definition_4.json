    "main_text": "Variations\n5. Variations\n\nAs one gives more substance and detail to the general notions of\nendorsement, rationality, and the relevant conditions under which\nrational people would endorse morality, one moves further from\nproviding a definition of morality in the normative sense, and closer\nto providing an actual moral theory. And a similar claim is true for\ndefinitions of morality in the descriptive sense, as one specifies in\nmore detail what one means in claiming that a person or group endorses\na system or code. In the following four subsections, four broad ways\nof making the definitions of morality more precise are presented. They\nare all sufficiently schematic to be regarded as varieties of\ndefinition, rather than as theories.\n",
