    "main_text": "Grounds of Moral Status || Incompletely Realized Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities\n5.6 Incompletely Realized Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities\n\nAlmost all the accounts we have considered so far recognize\ncognitively sophisticated capacities as sufficient qualifications for\nFMS. The search for additional sufficient qualifications for FMS,\nmeant to secure the justification for the commonsense view of who\nshould have this highest status, has run into considerable\ndifficulties, chiefly: overinclusion, appeal to criteria of\nquestionable moral relevance, and loss of the impartiality\ncharacteristic of FMS.\n\nJaworska and Tannenbaum (2014) offer an alternative approach, anchored\nin the idea that cognitively sophisticated capacities can be realized\nincompletely. If cognitively sophisticated capacities are sufficient\nto elevate a being\u2019s moral status, so too should the same\nsophisticated capacities incompletely realized.\n\nTo understand this proposal, let\u2019s begin with incompletely\nrealized activities. These are activities one engages in when one\nlearns X \u201cby doing\u201d: e.g., a novice piano player learns to\nplay by slowly reading simple note sequences and pressing (at least\nsome) corresponding piano keys, guided by the end of mastering the\ninstrument. With certain background conditions in place, the pressing\nof the keys is best thought of not as playing the piano badly, but\nrather as incomplete realizations of what piano playing amounts to.\nJaworska and Tannenbaum interpret certain activities of cognitively\nunsophisticated humans analogously. With certain background conditions\nin place, when a child or a cognitively impaired adult models, even in\na most rudimentary way, a cognitively sophisticated activity, guided\nby a mentor\u2019s (parent\u2019s, caretaker\u2019s) end of the\nmentee acquiring cognitive sophistication, the mentee incompletely\nrealizes the corresponding cognitively sophisticated activity. For\ninstance, playing a simple game like\n\u201cI-smile-then-you-smile\u201d becomes rule following as an\nincomplete realization of practical reasoning.\n\nThe key background conditions are: (1) it must be reasonable for the\nmentor to adopt this end and (2) the mentee\u2019s activities must be\nfeasible means of achieving the mentor\u2019s aim. These conditions\nensure a sufficiently firm connection between the mentee\u2019s\nrudimentary activities and the mentor\u2019s end of the mentee\nmastering the sophisticated activity.\n\nNow consider capacities, since they, and not activities, ground moral\nstatus. Unimpaired babies\u2019 activities with their caretakers\ncan straightforwardly fit the above template, so babies have\nthe capacity to incompletely realize cognitively\nsophisticated activities, and thus have the corresponding elevated\nmoral status. Perhaps more surprisingly, even many human beings\nincapable of achieving cognitive sophistication can fit the above\ntemplate. A caretaker of such impaired humans is required, in virtue\nof that role, to have that human\u2019s flourishing as an end, and\nthe flourishing of a human being encompasses developing sophisticated\ncognitive capacities. When circumstances are unfavorable and the\ncaretaker cannot reasonably hold the latter, subsidiary end as an aim\nto be realized, the caretaker can still reasonably hold this end as a\nstandard (meeting condition 1), i.e. as a guide as to what next best\naim to adopt. The activities of many cognitively impaired human beings\ncan be feasible means to the caretaker\u2019s next best aim guided by\nthis standard (meeting condition 2). In this way, these beings have\nthe capacity to incompletely realize cognitively sophisticated\nactivities and so also have the corresponding elevated moral status.\nBy contrast, it would never be reasonable for a dog\u2019s caretaker\nto hold the standard of developing the dog\u2019s cognitive\nsophistication, since the dog can fully flourish without such\nsophistication. Moreover, typically it is also unreasonable to hold\nthe end of making the dog cognitively sophisticated as an aim (not\nmerely as a standard). But even in some odd circumstances a caretaker\ncould reasonably adopt this aim, the activities of the dog would fail\nthe feasibility condition (2). So, either way, dogs lack incompletely\nrealized cognitively sophisticated capacities.\n\nThus, this account overcomes the under- and overinclusion problems of\nthe accounts canvassed above. Moreover, the capacities this account\nappeals to are modest extensions of the capacities deemed morally\nrelevant by a broad spectrum of views. In addition, the account\ngrounds impartial rather than relationship-based reasons for moral\nregard: the feature grounding status is not a relationship but rather\nis vested in the individual, just as the capacity to play a squash\nmatch is vested in the individual even though this requires that\nsomeone could play with her. The main shortcoming of this account is\nthat, although it provides grounds for an elevation of moral status,\nthere is no guarantee that this elevated status reaches the full array\n(and strength) of protections and entitlements associated with FMS.\nThe goal of this particular account was to show that two beings (e.g.\na baby and a dog) who are otherwise cognitively on a par, can have\ndiffering moral statuses in virtue of the fact that one, and not the\nother, currently has cognitively sophisticated capacities incompletely\nrealized. The account assumes that cognitively sophisticated\ncapacities are sufficient for FMS but does not address whether such\nincompletely realized capacities ground FMS or only a somewhat lesser\nmoral status.\n",
