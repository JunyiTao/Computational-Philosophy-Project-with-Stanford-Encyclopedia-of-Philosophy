What is Social Construction?\n\nWhile constructionist claims often take the passive form of a\ndeclaration that \u201cY is socially constructed,\u201d it\nis more useful to think of social constructionist claims as having the\nform of a two-part relation:\n\nX socially constructs Y.\n\n\nWe can then think of different accounts of social construction as\ndiffering in their accounts either of the relation itself, or of one\nor both relata.\n",
