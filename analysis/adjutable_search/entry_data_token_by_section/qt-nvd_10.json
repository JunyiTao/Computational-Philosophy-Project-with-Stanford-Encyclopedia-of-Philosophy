    "main_text": "Dirac and the Foundations of Quantum Theory || Pragmatics versus Axiomatics\n5.2 Middle Grounds\n\nEgg, Lam, and Oldofredi (2017) argue that the main disagreement\nbetween Doreen Fraser and David Wallace is over the very definition of\nQFT. Fraser takes QFT to be the union of quantum theory and special\nrelativity. If QFT = QM + SR as Fraser maintains, then LQFT fails to\nsatisfy that criterion since it employs cutoffs which violate\nPoincar\u00e9 covariance. For Wallace, the violation of QFT\nPoincar\u00e9 covariance is not as worrisome. QFT is not a truly\nfundamental theory since gravity is absent. Wallace is more interested\nin what QFT\u2019s approximate truth tells us about the world. LQFT\ngives us an effective ontology. The renormalization group tell us that\nQFT cannot be trusted in the high energy regimes where quantum gravity\ncan be expected to apply, i.e., the Planckian length scale where\ngravitational effects cannot be ignored. The violation of\nPoincar\u00e9 covariance via cutoffs may not amount to much if the\nfundamental quantum theory of gravity imposes some real cutoff,\naccording to Wallace. There are, however, other options to\nconsider.\n5.2.1 Pluralistic Approaches \n\nSome philosophers have rejected the seemingly either-or nature of the\ndebate between Wallace and Fraser to embrace more pluralistic views.\nOn these pluralistic views, different formulations of QFT might be\nappropriate for different philosophical questions. Baker (2016)\nadvocates that AQFT or LQFT should be trusted in domains of inquiry\nwhere their idealizations are unproblematic. For example, if the\ndomain to be interpreted is the Standard Model, then LQFT is the\nappropriate framework. Swanson (2017) analyzes LQFT, AQFT, and\nWightman QFT and argues that all three approaches are complementary\nand have no deep incompatibilities. LQFT supplies various powerful\npredictive tools and explanatory schemas. It can account for gauge\ntheories, the Standard Model of particle physics, the weak and strong\nnuclear force, and the electromagnetic force. However, the collection\nof calculational techniques are not all mathematically well-defined.\nLQFT provides QFT theories at only certain length scales and cannot\nmake use of unitarily inequivalent representations since LQFT uses\ncutoffs which renders all representations finite dimensional and\nunitarily equivalent by the Stone-von Neumann theorem. Axiomatic QFT\nis supposed to provide a rigorous description of fundamental QFT at\nall length scales, but that conflicts with the effective field theory\nviewpoint where QFT is only defined for certain lengths. But if\naxiomatic QFT capture what all QFTs have in common, then effective\nfield theories should be captured by it as well. Axiomatic QFT gives a\nprecise regimentation of LQFT, but it is unclear if axiomatic QFT is\nfully faithful to the LQFT picture. Within the axiomatic approach,\nWightman QFT has many sophisticated tools for building concrete models\nof QFT in addition to rigorously proving structural results like the\nPCT theorem and the spin statistics theorem. But Wightman QFT relies\non localized gauge-dependent field operators that do not directly\nrepresent physical properties. AQFT might provide a more physically\ntransparent gauge-free description of QFT. It has topological tools to\ndefine global quantities like temperature, energy, charge, particle\nnumber which use unitarily inequivalent representations. But AQFT has\ndifficulty constructing models. While LQFT is more mathematically\namorphous, there are recent algebraic constructions of low dimensional\ninteracting models with no known Lagrangian, which suggest that AQFT\nis more general than LQFT (Swanson 2017, p. 5). However, LQFT provides\nconstructive QFT with guidance on correctly building models\ncorresponding to Lagrangians particle physicists use with great\nempirical success (Hancox-Li 2017, p. 353).\n5.2.2 Constructive Quantum Field Theory\n\nConstructive QFT is an attempt to mediate between LQFT and axiomatic\nQFT by rigorously constructing specific interacting models of QFT. The\nnontrivial solutions it constructs are supposed to correspond to\nLagrangians that particle physicists use. This ensures that various\naxiomatic systems have a physical connection to the world via the\nempirical success of LQFT. While constructive QFT has done this for\nsome models with dimensions less than 4, it has not yet been\naccomplished for a 4 dimensional Lagrangian that particle physicists\nuse. Any model that satisfies the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms will\nautomatically satisfy the Wightman axioms. Constructive QFT tries to\nconstruct the functional integral measures for path integrals by\nshifting from Minkowski spacetime to Euclidean spacetime via a Wick\nrotation (what follows is based on section four of Hancox-Li (2017)).\nIn Euclidean field theory, the Schwinger functions, which are defined\nin terms of \\(Z\\), must satisfy the\nOsterwalder-Schrader axioms. The measure of \\(Z\\) is a\nGaussian measure on the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing\nfunctions. The Osterwalder-Schrader axioms are related to the Wightman\naxioms by the Osterwalder-Schrader Reconstruction Theorem which states\nthat any set of functions satisfying the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms\ndetermines a unique Wightman model whose Schwinger functions form that\nset. It allows the constructive field theorists to use the advantages\nof Euclidean space for defining a measure while ensuring that they are\nconstructing models that exist in Minkowski spacetime. It still has to\nbe verified that the solution corresponds to a renormalized\nperturbation series that physicists derive for the corresponding\nLagrangian in LQFT. The challenge is how to translate something not\nmathematically well-defined into something that is while showing that\nthe \u201csolutions\u201d in LQFT can be reproduced by something\nthat is consistent with a set of axioms. This is crucial since, as\nSwanson (2017) points out, it is unclear whether perturbation theory\nis an accurate guide for the underlying physics described by LQFT.\nThis leads Hancox-Li (2017) to argue that mathematically unrigorous\nLQFT is relevant to the rigorous program of constructive QFT in\nbuilding rigorous interacting models of QFT. Those models correspond\nto the Lagrangians of interest to particle physicists. Hence, LQFT can\ninform the theoretical content of QFT.\n\nAnother tool of constructive QFT is the use of asymptotic series,\nwhich can tell us which function the perturbative series is asymptotic\nto, which perturbative QFT does not. Constructive QFT tries to\ndetermine some properties of non-perturbative solutions to the\nequations of motion which guarantee that certain methods of summing\nasymptotic expansions will lead to a unique solution (see Hancox-Li\n2017, pp. 349\u2013350, for more details). Is the rigorously defined\npartition function \\(Z\\) asymptotic to the renormalized\nperturbative series? Roughly, a function is asymptotic to a series\nexpansion when successive terms of the series provide an increasingly\naccurate description of how quickly the function grows. The difference\nbetween the function and each order of the perturbation series is\napproximately small. But there are many different functions that have\nthe same asymptotic expansion. Ideally, we want there to be a unique\nfunction because then there is a unique non-perturbative solution. The\nconcept of strong asymptoticity requires that the difference between\nthe function and each order of the series is smaller than what was\nrequired by asymptoticity. A strongly asymptotic series uniquely\ndetermines a function. If there is a strong asymptotic series, then\nthe function can be uniquely reconstructed from the series by Borel\nsummation. The Borel transform of the series is given by dividing the\ncoefficients each term in the series by a factorial of the order of\nthat term and then integrating to recover the exact function. In\nconstructive QFT, the goal is to associate a unique function with a\nrenormalized perturbation series and some kind of Borel summability is\nthe main candidate so far, though the Borel transform cannot remove\nlarge-order divergences. The asymptotic behavior of the renormalized\nperturbation series can be extremely sensitive to the choice of\nregularization and render it asymptotic to a free field theory even if\nit appears to describe nontrivial perturbations (see Swanson 2017, p.\n11, for more details).\n",
