    "main_text": "Non-causal and Mathematical Explanation\n6. Additional Issues\n\nBesides the authors discussed above, there is a great deal of\nadditional recent work related to causal explanation that we lack the\nspace to discuss. For additional work on the role of abstraction and\nidealization in causal explanation (and whether the presence of\nvarious sorts of abstraction and idealization in an explanation\nimplies that it is non-causal) see Janssen and Saatsi (2019),\nReutlinger and Andersen (2016), Blanchard (2020), Rice (2021), and\nPincock (2022). Another set of issues that has received a great deal\nof recent attention concerns causal explanation in contexts in which\ndifferent \u201clevels\u201d are present (Craver & Bechtel 2007;\nBaumgartner 2010; Woodward 2020) This literature addresses questions\nof the following sort. Can there be \u201cupper-level\u201d\ncausation at all or does all causal action occur at some lower,\nmicrophysical level, with upper-level variables being casually inert?\nCan there be \u201ccross-level\u201d causation \u2013 e.g.,\n\u201cdownward\u201d causation from upper to lower levels? Finally,\nin addition to the work on explanatory depth discussed in\n Section 4,\n there has been a substantial amount of recent work on distinctions\namong different sorts of causal claims (Woodward 2010; Ross 2021a;\nRoss & Woodward 2022) and on what makes some causes more\nexplanatorily significant than others (e.g., Potochnik 2015).\n",
