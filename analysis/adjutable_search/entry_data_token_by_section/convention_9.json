    "main_text": "Critical reactions to Lewis || Alternative conventions?\n4.2 Alternative conventions?\n\n\nSeumas Miller (2001) deploys an example of Jean-Jacques Rousseau to\nquestion whether a convention must have a conventional alternative. In\nRousseau\u2019s example, agents stationed throughout a forest must\ndecide whether to hunt stag or hunt hares. Hunting stag yields a higher\npay-off for everyone, but only if all other players hunt stag as well.\nWe can represent a two-person stag hunt through the following pay-off\nmatrix:\n\n\n\n\nHunt Stag\nHunt Hare\n\n\nHunt Stag\n2, 2\n0, 1\n\n\nHunt Hare\n1, 0\n1, 1\n\n\nThe Stag Hunt Payoff Matrix\n\n\n\nMiller argues that, on Lewis\u2019s definition of\n\u201cconvention,\u201d hunting hares is not a possible convention, since a\nplayer who chooses to hunt rabbits does not prefer that the other\nplayer do likewise. Miller argues that this result accords with\nintuition. He furthermore argues that hunting stag \\(is\\),\nintuitively speaking, a possible convention. He concludes that Lewis errs by\nrequiring convention to have a conventional alternative.\n\n\nTyler Burge (1975) develops a related but distinct worry. He agrees\nwith Lewis that convention must have a conventional alternative, but he\ndenies that participants must know of such an alternative.\nBurge offers as an example a primitive, isolated society with a single\nlanguage. Members of this society believe, as a matter of religious\nprinciple, that theirs is the only possible language. Nevertheless,\nBurge argues, their linguistic practice is governed by convention.\nBurge concludes that Lewis adopts an overly\n\u201cintellectualist\u201d conception of convention, one that\ncredits participants in convention with far more rational\nself-understanding than they necessarily possess. While Burge agrees\nwith Lewis that conventions are arbitrary, he thinks that \u201cthe\narbitrariness of conventions resides somehow in the \u2018logic of the\nsituation\u2019 rather than in the participants\u2019 psychological\nlife\u201d (p. 253). For Burge, the arbitrariness of a convention\nconsists in the following facts: the conventions operative within a\nsociety emerge due to historical accident, not biological,\npsychological or sociological law; and, with effort comparable to that\nexpended in learning the original convention, parties to the convention\ncould have instead learned an incompatible convention that\nwould have served roughly the same social purpose.\n",
