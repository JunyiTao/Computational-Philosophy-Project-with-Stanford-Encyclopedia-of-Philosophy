    "main_text": "Current Views on Thought Experiments || The Mental\u2013Model Account\n4.6 The Mental\u2013Model Account\n\nThe last of the many accounts that emerged in the discussion about\nthought experiments is what could be called the\n\u201cmental\u2013model account.\u201d It attracts the most\nfollowers (see Andreas 2011; Bishop 1998; Cooper 2005; Gendler 2004;\nPalmieri 2003; Nersessian 1992, 1993, 2007; McMullin 1985;\nMi\u0161\u010devi\u0107 1992, 2007, 2021). When we conduct a thought\nexperiment, according to champions of this view, we manipulate a\nmental model instead of the physical realm: \u201cThe general claim\nis that in certain problem-solving tasks people reason by constructing\na mental model of the situations, events, and processes that in\ndynamic cases can be manipulated through simulation\u201d (Nersessian\n2018, p. 319). Like physical models, mental models are\nnon-propositional in nature. This means first of all \u201cthat the\ncarefully crafted thought\u2013experimental narrative focuses on the\nconstruction of a model of a kind of situation and\nmanipulating that model through simulation affords epistemic access to\ncertain features of current representations in a way that manipulating\npropositional representations using logical rules cannot\u201d\n(Nersessian 2018, pp. 319\u2013320). A narrative functions as a kind\nof user-manual for building the model, but it isn\u2019t identical to\na thought experiment. The biggest problem for the mental\u2013model\naccount is to explain how something non-propositional like a mental\nmodel can make an impact on the propositional realm, which happens\nwhen a thought experiment causes a revision in beliefs.\n",
