In this section, we\nwill give an overview of some of the ways in which comparative\ncognition has influenced ethics and political theory.\n3.7.1 Ethics\n\nEthical theorizing regarding animals focuses on two main issues: the\nquestion of moral status and the question of moral treatment. The\ndiscussion on moral status attempts to establish which animals are\nowed moral consideration and on what grounds. The discussion on moral\ntreatment starts from the assumption that some animals have moral\nstatus and aims to elucidate what the interests of these animals are\nand how to manage situations in which they conflict with our own.\nDiscussions in both of these debates are often informed by comparative\ncognition research.\n\nThe most common capacity that has been used to ground animals\u2019\nmoral status is sentience, roughly defined as the capacity to feel\npleasure and pain. Sentience is widely regarded as sufficient for\nanimals to be owed moral consideration, since only sentient animals\ncare about what happens to them. Early animal ethics focused\non animals most directly and gravely affected by human practices,\nnamely, the mammals and birds used in food production and biomedical\nresearch, and built a case in their defense based on evidence of their\nsentience. In recent years, evidence of sentience in other taxa is\nbeing used to argue that the circle of moral consideration should be\nwidened to include fish (Balcombe 2016; Sneddon 2006), cephalopods\n(King & Marino 2019; Mather & Anderson 2007), and arthropods\n(Mikhalevich & Powell 2020). Evidence from comparative psychology\nthat points to some animals being capable of sophisticated forms of\nagency has also been used in attempts to ground moral status on this\ncapacity (Sebo 2017; Wilcox 2020). Other philosophers object to using\nindividualistic cognitive capacities to ground moral standing, and\ninstead rely on our perception of animals and pre-existing\nrelationships as the relevant properties (Crary 2010; Diamond 1978;\nGruen 2015). However, it has been argued that even these approaches\ncannot ignore the cognitive capacities of individuals (Mons\u00f3\n& Grimm 2019).\n\nIf animals have moral status, the question emerges: what sort of\ntreatment are they owed? Moral treatment is usually considered to be a\nfunction of the interests that a being has, and these are\nclosely linked to their psychological capacities. Inspired by findings\nin comparative cognition, scholars have argued that some animals not\nonly have an interest in experiencing pleasure and avoiding pain, but\nthat they can also enjoy other goods, such as freedom (Gruen 2018;\nSchmidt 2015), friendship (Fr\u00f6\u00f6ding & Peterson 2011),\nrelationships of care (Mons\u00f3, Benz-Schwarzburg, & Bremhorst\n2018), and meaning (Purves & Delon 2018). This has potential\nimplications for the moral treatment that animals are owed, because it\ncould mean that animals are not just wronged when they are made to\nfeel pain, but also when they are deprived of opportunities to enjoy\nthese other goods.\n3.7.2 Political theory\n\nRecent years have witnessed a political turn in animal ethics, with\nthe appearance of several theories that discuss how political\ninstitutions and processes can be transformed to guarantee justice for\nanimals (Cochrane, Garner, & O\u2019Sullivan 2018). This work is\nsomewhat less capacity-oriented than traditional animal ethics, since\nit does not focus on the moral obligations of individual humans\ntowards animals, and tends to highlight instead the sorts of\nobligations that are generated at the state level by the relationships\nthat humans have historically held with animals (Donaldson &\nKymlicka 2011).\n\nStill, some of the work in political theory has been influenced by\nfindings in comparative cognition. An example of this is the debate\nsurrounding the notion of personhood, a term that marks those beings\nwho are entitled to legal protection, and which is often linked to\ncertain cognitive capacities, such as rationality, self-awareness, or\nsociality. Drawing on the accumulating psychological evidence,\nscholars have defended that personhood should be granted to great apes\n(Andrews et al. 2018; Cavalieri & Singer 1993), cetaceans\n(Cavalieri 2011; White 2007), and elephants (Poole 1998). The\ncapacities of animals documented by comparative cognition have also\nbeen used to defend different ways in which animals can be seen as\nhaving a political agency of their own, and thus as capable of\nengaging in political participation. Meijer (2019), for instance, has\nargued that animals can communicate in complex and nuanced ways using\nmultimodal signals, and that by means of these they can express their\nneeds and negotiate their relationships with us. Rather than seeing\nthem merely as voiceless victims, she encourages us to take their\nvoices into account when shaping an interspecies democracy.\n3.8 Summary\n\nThe philosophy of animal minds is a rich and growing area of\nphilosophy. Philosophers engage with the science of animal cognition\nto analyze the methods, assumptions, and values in the science itself.\nPhilosophers also use the research findings to support theories in\ntraditional topics in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind,\nlanguage and action, and value theory. Finally, attention to animal\ncognition can also highlight previously overlooked philosophical\nissues related to the nature of culture, learning, and teaching, and\nit provides a new lens to consider classic questions about human\nnature and our place among all the other animals.",
