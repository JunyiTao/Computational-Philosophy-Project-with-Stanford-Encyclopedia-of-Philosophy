But even if they were elegant and\naccessible, reading the Guide, and other translated texts,\nwould require background in philosophy. This Ibn Tibbon recognized.\nThus he did far more than simply producing literal translations; he\nalso initiated the creation of a cognate literature in Hebrew:\nphilosophical reference works and study aids. He produced the first\nmajor lexicon of philosophical Hebrew; and he included explanatory\nglosses in the margins of his translation of the Guide, which\nestablished the foundation for a proper commentary tradition. A brief\ndiscussion of the glossary will be given here.\n\n\nThe philosophical glossary or lexicon is, in fact, a very old genre.\nThe tradition of defining key terms was developed already in late\nantiquity, and continued into the Middle Ages. For example, al-Kindi,\nAvicenna, and Isaac Israeli all wrote books of definitions.\n\n\nIbn Tibbon\u2019s Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot was the first\nmajor philosophical lexicon written in Hebrew. It was written not as a\ngeneral introduction to philosophy, like the work of his predecessors,\nbut as a glossary to one translated text: Maimonides\u2019 Guide\nof the Perplexed. In fact, however, it is much more. It includes\nextended discussions of key terms, and works as both glossary and\nlexicon, introduction and primer. Many philosophical ideas appear in\nHebrew for the first time in the glossary; and there is evidence that\nthe text itself was studied independently, as a general reference work\nor study aid.\n\n\nIn order to illustrate its character, I\u2019ll present here four\nentries from the glossary: rhetorical statement, natural science (or\nphysics), divine science (or metaphysics), and mathematics. With these\nfour entries, Ibn Tibbon introduced his Hebrew reader to the entire\nAristotelian curriculum as it had developed in the Arabic world\n(including pseudo-Aristotelian works).\n\n\n1. Rhetorical Statement [Ma\u2019amar Haggadi]:\n\n\nKnow that there are five types of syllogism; Aristotle wrote a book\nabout each. The first is the demonstrative syllogism, in which\nsomething is deduced from true premises. He called [his book on this\ntype of syllogism] the \u201cBook on Demonstration\u201d\n[=Posterior Analytics]. The second is the dialectical\nsyllogism, in which something is deduced from generally accepted\npremises. He called [his book on this type of syllogism] the\n\u201cBook on Dispute and Victory\u201d [=Topics]. The\nthird type is the rhetorical syllogism, in which the premises are\nconvincing, that is, they convince the masses of their truth such that\nthey believe in them. These are inferior to the generally accepted\npremises; and they are certainly inferior to the demonstrative. He\ncalled [his book on this type of syllogism] \u201cRhetoric.\u201d\nWith this type of statement or syllogism, moreover, one preaches to\nthe people in order to incite them to do something or refrain from\ndoing something or to fix in their hearts the love of something such\nthat they approach it or the hatred of something such that they remove\nthemselves from it. A statement of this type is called\n\u201crhetorical statement,\u201d just as a statement of the first\ntype is called \u201cdemonstrative statement\u201d and one of the\nsecond is called \u201cdialectical statement.\u201d The fourth is\nthe poetic syllogism, in which the premises are such that they create\nan image in the heart of whoever hears them. This image leads such a\nperson to love or hate something, even when he knows that there is no\ntruth in those statements. He called [his book on this type of\nsyllogism] \u201cPoetics.\u201d The fifth [type of syllogism] is the\nsophistical syllogism, of which there are two types: a) the premises\nthemselves are sophistical, that is, although they appear to be true,\nwhen they are examined carefully by a scholar he finds that one or\nboth are false; b) although the premises are true, their combination\ndoes not generate a [true] conclusion, even though it seems to do\nso. This second type will deceive anyone who fails to examine [the\nconclusion] carefully or who is not an expert with regard to all of\nthe conditions of syllogisms. The name of the book concerning this,\nthe fifth, type of syllogism is the \u201cBook of Sophistry;\u201d\nit is the book called in Arabic al-Safsata and in Romance\nSofistica. These [five] works were prefaced by Aristotle with\nhis \u201cBook on Syllogism\u201d [=Prior Analytics], in\nwhich he discusses all of them and makes known [in general] the\nconditions and properties of the syllogism.\n\n\n2. Natural Science (Physics):\n\n\nThe Master [Maimonides] has indicated that this is what the Sages\ncalled the \u201caccount of the beginning.\u201d He meant by this\nthat the secrets of the \u201caccount of the beginning\u201d\nrepresent chapter headings in natural science, which is the science\nthat investigates all aspects of things that are governed by nature,\ni.e., all celestial and sublunary bodies and their accidents. The final\nsource of all books in this science are those written by Aristotle.\nThese include the following: 1) \u201cThe Discourses on Nature\u201d\n[=Physics], in which natural things are discussed in general.\n2) \u201cOn the Heavens and the World,\u201d in which the spheres,\nplanets, and stars, along with the four elements and their mixtures,\nare discussed in general. 3) \u201cOn Generation and\nCorruption,\u201d in which the causes of generation and corruption,\ntheir attributes and quiddity, are discussed in particular. 4)\n\u201cThe Signs of Heaven\u201d [=Meteorology], in which\naccidents and things that come into existence in the upper part of the\natmosphere are discussed; some of these things, when they come into\nexistence, are also found on land or in the sea. 5) \u201cOn Minerals\nand Stones,\u201d in which their quiddity and quality are discussed.\n6) \u201cOn Plants,\u201d in which the nature of every thing that\nexperiences growth is discussed. 7) \u201cOn Animals,\u201d in which\nall accidents which affect both rational and irrational animals are\ndiscussed, as well as the utility of their limbs. 8) \u201cOn the\nSoul,\u201d in which the faculties of the human soul are discussed in\ngeneral. 9) \u201cOn Sense and Sensibilia\u201d [=Parva\nnaturalia], in which the nature of the senses in particular, as\nwell as sleep and being awake, are discussed. As for the chapter\nheadings set forth in the biblical section on Genesis, they cover only\na small portion of what is contained in these books: not one in a\nhundred or even one in two hundred\u2026\n\n\n3. Divine Science (Metaphysics):\n\n\nA science which discusses that which has no nature, i.e., things that\nare intellectual and separate from matter, like the Lord, His angels,\nand other things that derive from the actions of the intellect and\nfrom the knowledge of the intellect\u2014they have no action in the\nsense world. The root of all books in this science is\nAristotle\u2019s book called \u201cMetaphysics.\u201d\n\n\n4. Mathematics:\n\n\nKnow that the demonstrative sciences have three divisions: natural\nscience, mathematics, and divine science. We have already explained\nthe first and the last. As for the second, namely mathematics, it\nincludes geometry, arithmetic, astronomy\u2014which includes the\nstudy of the spheres and planets and the judgments of the planets\n[=astrology]\u2014and the science of melody, which is called\n\u201cmusic.\u201d The three terms \u201cmathematics,\u201d\n\u201cpropadeutic\u201d and \u201ctraining\u201d are synonyms used\nfor this division of science; for it is like a science that trains,\nteaches, or serves the other two divisions.\n",
