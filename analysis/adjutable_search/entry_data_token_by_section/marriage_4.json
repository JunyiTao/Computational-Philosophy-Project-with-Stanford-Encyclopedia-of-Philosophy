    "main_text": "Marriage and Morals || Institutional Views\n3.2 Institutional Views\n\nThe main theoretical alternatives to the contractual view hold that\nmarital obligations are defined by the purpose of the institution and\nthat spouses cannot alter these institutional obligations (much like\nthe professional moral obligations of a doctor; to become a doctor,\none must voluntarily accept the role and its obligations, and one\ncannot negotiate the content of these obligations). The challenge for\ninstitutional views is to defend such a view of marriage, explaining\nwhy spouses may not jointly agree to alter obligations associated with\nmarriage. Kant confronted this question, arguing that special marital\nrights were morally necessary for permissible sex. His account of\nsexual objectification has influenced a prominent contemporary rival\nto the contractual view\u2014the new natural law view, which takes\nprocreation as essential to marriage. A second widespread approach\nfocuses solely on love as the defining purpose of marriage.\n3.2.1 New Natural Law: Marriage as Procreative Union\n\nLike Kant, the new natural law account of marriage focuses on the\npermissible exercise of sexual attributes; following Aquinas, it\nemphasizes the goods of marriage, which new natural lawyers, notably\nJohn Finnis (cf. George 2000, Grisez 1993, Lee 2008), identify as\nreproduction and fides\u2014roughly, marital friendship (see\nentry on The Natural Law Tradition in Ethics). Marriage is here taken\nto be the institution uniquely apt for conceiving and rearing children\nby securing the participation of both parents in an ongoing union. The\nthought is that there is a distinctive marital good related to sexual\ncapacities, consisting in procreation and fides, and\nrealizable only in marriage. Within marriage, sex may be engaged in\nfor the sake of the marital good. Marital sex need not result in\nconception to be permissible; it is enough that it is open towards\nprocreation and expresses fides. The view does not entail\nthat it is wrong to take pleasure in sex, for this can be part of the\nmarital good.\n\nHowever, sex outside marriage (as defined here) cannot be orientated\ntoward the marital good. Furthermore, sexual activity not orientated\ntoward this good\u2014including same-sex activity, masturbation,\ncontracepted sex, sex without marital commitment (even within legal\nmarriage)\u2014is valueless; it does not instantiate any basic good.\nFurthermore, such activity is impermissible because it violates the\nbasic good of marriage. Marital sex is thought to instantiate the good\nof marriage. By contrast, non-marital sex is thought to treat sexual\ncapacities instrumentally\u2014using them merely for pleasure. (It is\nhere that the account is influenced by Kant.) Non-marital sex violates\nthe good of marriage by treating sexual capacities in a way contrary\nto that good. Furthermore, for an agent merely to condone non-marital\nsex damages his or her relation to the marital good, for even a\nhypothetical willingness to treat sex instrumentally precludes proper\nmarital commitment (Finnis 1997, 120).\n\nAs Finnis emphasizes, one feature of the new natural law account of\nmarriage is that the structure of marriage can be fully explained by\nits purpose. Marriage is between one man and one woman because this is\nthe unit able to procreate without third-party assistance; permanence\nis required to give children a lifelong family. Finnis charges, as\nnoted above, that accounts which do not ground marriage in this\npurpose have no theoretical reason to resist the extension of marriage\nto polygamy, incest, and bestiality (Finnis 1995). As all non-marital\nsex fails to instantiate basic goods, there is no way morally to\ndistinguish these different relations.\n\nA further point concerns law: to guide citizens\u2019 judgments and\nchoices towards the relationship in which they can uniquely achieve\nthe marital good, the state should endorse marriage, as understood on\nthis view, and not recognize same-sex relationships as marriages.\nHowever, it might be asked whether this is an effective way to guide\nchoice, and whether state resources might be better spent promoting\nother basic human goods. Moreover, as the argument equally implies a\nstate interest in discouraging contraception, divorce, and\nextra-marital sex, the focus on same-sex marriage appears arbitrary\n(Garrett 2008, Macedo 1995). This objection is a specific instance of\na more general objection: this account treats sex and the marital good\ndifferently than it does the other basic human goods. Not only is less\nattention paid to promoting those goods legally (and discouraging\nbehavior contrary to them), but the moral principle forbidding action\ncontrary to basic human goods is not consistently applied\nelsewhere\u2014for example, to eating unhealthily (Garrett 2008).\n\nA second objection attacks the claim that non-marital sex cannot\ninstantiate any basic human goods. This implausibly consigns all\nnon-marital sex (including all contracepted sex) to the same value as\nanonymous sex, prostitution, or masturbation (Macedo 1995, 282).\nPlausibly, non-marital sex can instantiate goods such as\n\u201cpleasure, communication, emotional growth, personal stability,\nlong-term fulfillment\u201d (Corvino 2005, 512), or other basic human\ngoods identified by the new natural law account, such as knowledge,\nplay, and friendship (Garrett 2008; see also Blankschaen 2020).\n\nA third objection is related. The view seems to involve a double\nstandard in permitting infertile opposite-sex couples to marry\n(Corvino 2005; Macedo 1995). The new natural lawyers have responded\nthat penile-vaginal sex is reproductive in type, even if not in\neffect, while same-sex activity can never be reproductive in type\n(Finnis 1997, cf. George 2000, Lee 2008). Reproductive-type sex can be\noriented towards procreation even if not procreative in effect. But it\nis unclear how individuals who know themselves to be infertile can\nhave sex for the reason of procreation (Macedo 1995, Buccola 2005).\nUltimately, to differentiate infertile heterosexual couples from\nsame-sex couples, new natural lawyers invoke complementarity between\nmen and women as partners and parents. Thus, the defense of this\naccount of marriage turns on a controversial view of the nature and\nimportance of sexual difference (Finnis 1997, Lee 2008).\n\nA related, influential argument focuses on the definition of marriage.\nThis argues that marriage is necessarily between one man and one woman\nbecause it involves a comprehensive union between spouses, a unity of\nlives, minds, and bodies. Organic bodily union requires being united\nfor a biological purpose, in a procreative-type act (Girgis, et al.,\n2010). Like the new natural law arguments, this has raised questions\nas to why only, and all, different-sex couples, even infertile ones,\ncan partake in procreative-type acts, and why bodily union has special\nsignificance (Arroyo 2018, Johnson 2013).\n\nWhile much discussion of new natural law accounts of marriage\noscillates between attacking and defending the basis in biological sex\ndifference, some theorists sympathetic to new natural law attempt to\navoid the Scylla of rigid biological restrictions and the Charybdis of\nliberal \u201cplasticity\u201d regarding marriage (Goldstein 2011).\nGoldstein, for one, offers an account of marriage as a project\ngenerated by the basic good of friendship; while this project includes\nprocreation as a core feature, the institution of marriage has, on\nthis account, a compensatory power, meaning that the institution\nitself can compensate for failures such as inability to procreate.\nSuch an account grounds marriage in the new natural law account of\nflourishing, but it also allows the extension to same-sex marriage\nwithout, according to Goldstein, permitting other forms such as\npolygamy.\n3.2.2 Marriage as Protecting Love\n\nA second widespread (though less unified) institutional approach to\nmarriage appeals to the ideal marital love relationship to define the\nstructure of marriage. This approach, in the work of different\nphilosophers, yields a variety of specific prescriptions, on, for\nexample, whether marital love (or committed romantic love in general)\nrequires sexual difference or sexual exclusivity (Scruton 1986,\n305\u2013311, Chapter 11, Halwani 2003, 226\u2013242, Chartier\n2016). Some, but not all, proponents explicitly argue that the marital\nlove relationship is an objective good (Scruton 1986, Chapter 11,\n356\u2013361, Martin 1993). These views, however, all take the\nessential feature, and purpose, of marriage to be protecting a sexual\nlove relationship. The thought is that marriage helps to maintain and\nsupport a relationship either in itself valuable, or at least valued\nby the parties to it.\n\nOn this approach, the structure of marriage derives from the behavior\nneeded to maintain such a relationship. Thus marriage involves a\ncommitment to act for the relationship as well as to exclude\nincompatible options\u2014although there is controversy over what\nspecific policies these general commitments entail. To take an\nuncontroversial example, marriage creates obligations to perform acts\nwhich sustain love, such as focusing on the beloved\u2019s good\nqualities (Landau 2004). More controversially, some philosophers argue\nthat sustaining a love relationship requires sexual exclusivity. The\nthought is that sexual activity generates intimacy and affection, and\nthat objects of affection and intimacy will likely come into\ncompetition, threatening the marital relationship. Another version\nfocuses on the emotional harm, and consequent damage to the\nrelationship, caused by sexual jealousy. Thus, due to the\npsychological conditions required to maintain romantic love, marriage,\nas a love-protecting institution, generates obligations to sexual\nexclusivity (Martin 1993, Martin 1994, Scruton 1986, Chapter 11,\n356\u2013361, Steinbock 1986). However, philosophers dispute the\npsychological conditions needed to maintain romantic love. Some argue\nthat casual extra-marital sex need not create competing relationships\nor trigger jealousy (Halwani 2003, 235; Wasserstrom 1974). Indeed,\nsome have even argued that extra-marital sex, or greater social\ntolerance thereof, could strengthen otherwise difficult marriages\n(Russell 1929, Chapter 16), and some polyamorists (those who engage in\nmultiple sex or love relationships) claim that polyamory allows\ngreater honesty and openness than exclusivity (Emens 2004). Other\nphilosophers have treated sexual fidelity as something of a red\nherring, shifting focus to other qualities of an ideal relationship\nsuch as attentiveness, warmth, and honesty, or a commitment to justice\nin the relationship (Martin 1993, Kleingeld 1998).\n\nViews understanding marriage as protecting love generate diverse\nconclusions regarding its obligations. But such views share two\ncrucial assumptions: that marriage has a role to play in creating a\ncommitment to a love relationship, and that such commitments may be\nefficacious in protecting love (Cave 2003, Landau 2004, Martin 1993,\nMartin 1994, Mendus 1984, Scruton 1986, 356\u2013361). However, both\nof these assumptions may be questioned. First, even if commitment can\nprotect a love relationship, why must such a commitment be made\nthrough a formal marriage? If it is possible to maintain a long-term\nromantic relationship outside marriage, the question as to the point\nof marriage re-emerges: do we really need marriage for love? May not\nthe legal and social supports of marriage, indeed, trap individuals in\na loveless marriage or themselves corrode love by associating it with\nobligation? (Card 1996, Cave 2003; see also Gheaus 2016) Second, can\ncommitment, within or without marriage, really protect romantic love?\nHigh divorce rates would seem to suggest not. Of course, even if, as\ndiscussed in 3.1, agents cannot control whether they love, they can\nmake a commitment to act in ways protective of love (Landau 2004,\nMendus 1984). But this returns us the difficulty, suggested by the\npreceding paragraph, of knowing how to protect love!\n\nReflecting the difficulty of generating specific rules to protect\nlove, many such views have understood the ethical content of marriage\nin terms of virtues (Steinbock 1991, Scruton 1986, Chapter 11,\n356\u2013361). The virtue approach analyzes marriage in terms of the\ndispositions it cultivates, an approach which, by its reference to\nemotional states, promises to explain the relevance of marriage to\nlove. However, such approaches must explain how marriage fosters\nvirtues (Brake 2012). Some virtue accounts cite the effects of its\nsocial status: marriage triggers social reactions which secure spousal\nprivacy and ward off the disruptive attention of outsiders (Scruton\n1986, 356\u2013361). Its legal obligations, too, can be understood as\nUlysses\n contracts[1]:\n they protect relationships when spontaneous affection wavers,\nsecuring agents\u2019 long-term commitments against passing desires.\nWhether or not such explanations ultimately show that marital status\nand obligations can play a role in protecting love, the general focus\non ideal marital love relationships may be characterized as overly\nidealistic when contrasted with problems in actual marriages, such as\nspousal abuse (Card 1996). This last point suggests that moral\nanalysis of marriage cannot be entirely separated from political and\nsocial inquiry.\n",
