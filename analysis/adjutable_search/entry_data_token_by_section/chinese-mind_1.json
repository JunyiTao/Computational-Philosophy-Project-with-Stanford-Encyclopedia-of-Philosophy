    "main_text": "The heart-mind and its ontological relation to the body in classical Chinese philosophy || Holistic interpretations of the relationship between heart-mind and body\n1.1 Holistic interpretations of the relationship between heart-mind and body\n\nRoger T. Ames interprets the heart-mind and body as parts of a process\nhe calls \u201cbodyheartminding\u201d. He identifies the medium of\nthis process as qi (\u6c23), the \u201cvital energy\nfield\u201d (Ames 2015: 173). What we call \u201cthings\u201d are\npersistent yet transitory perturbations of physical and psychic\nenergy. Life is a process of real energy. In a similar vein,\nFran\u00e7ois Jullien (2005 [2007]) contrasts the Greek separation\nof body or \u201corganic being\u201d, and the principle of life or\n\u201canimation\u201d, (2005 [2007: 56\u201359]) on the one hand,\nwith the Chinese view that organic being and animation both emerge\nfrom qi, \u201cbreath-energy\u201d, on the other hand. All\nthings are condensations or coagulations of a \u201cdiffuse and\ninvisible flow of energy that wends its way ceaselessly through the\nworld, animating as it goes\u201d (2005 [2007: 76]). In China, the\nphenomena associated in the West with the soul is light, refined\nqi (breath) while bone is denser qi. Jullien sees no\nontological divide in these graduated distinctions in Chinese\nthought.\n",
