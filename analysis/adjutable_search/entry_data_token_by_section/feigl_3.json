    "main_text": "Analysis of the Mind-Body Problem\n4. Analysis of the Mind-Body Problem\n\nFeigl\u2019s treatment of the mind-body problem is his probably best\nwell-known\u2014and at the same time most\ncontroversial\u2014contribution to philosophy. It is often lumped\ntogether with the views of U.T. Place, J.J.C. Smart, D.M. Armstrong,\nand other Australian, \u2018materialist,\u2019 philosophers (see,\nfor example Kim 1998, pp. 1\u20132). Indeed, both Feigl\u2019s and\nthe Australians\u2019 approach toward the mind-body problem share a\nnumber of similarities. On the whole, they are both versions of a\nnon-dualistic (anti-Cartesian), physicalistically inspired\n\u2018identity theory.\u2019 However, there are significant\ndifferences between the Austrian (i.e. Feigl\u2019s) and the\nAustralian version of\u00a0the identity theory (see Stubenberg 1997).\nWhereas the Australians take the physical as unproblematic and attempt\nto reduce the mental to the physical, Feigl takes the mental as\nunproblematic and attempts to integrate it into a sophisticated\nphysicalistic conception of the world.\n\nIt is important to note that Feigl\u2019s version of the identity\ntheory is not without precursors. It has even been argued that\n\u201c[s]een against the backdrop of nineteenth-century German and\nAustrian philosophy, Feigl\u2019s approach was neither novel nor\naudacious; he merely revived a tradition that had once been a\nmainstream topic turned unfashionable; to be exact, he modified and\nspelled out one specific traditional position\u201d (Heidelberger\n2003, p. 234). This might be exaggerated, but it can hardly be\ncontested that Feigl, in his treatment of the mind-body problem, was\n(again) committed to the critical realist accounts of Alois Riehl (cf.\nRiehl 1879, 1881, 1887; further R\u00f6d 2001) and especially of the\nearly (pre-Viennese) Schlick (see the entry on\n Moritz Schlick).\n As Feigl himself frequently pointed out, it was the early\nSchlick\u2019s \u201cdouble-knowledge\u201d or\n\u201cdouble-language\u201d theory that exerted the greatest\ninfluence upon his own approach (see, for example, Feigl 1981, p.\n288). In a nutshell, Schlick, in his General Theory of\nKnowledge (1918; 1925), had argued that the difference of the\nmental and the physical is a difference between two conceptual systems\nand not a difference between two areas of reality. It was, in other\nwords, an epistemological rather than a metaphysical problem (cf.\nSchlick 1974, p. 300). According to Schlick, the \u201crelation\nbetween immediately experienced reality and the physical brain\nprocesses is [\u2026] no longer one of causal dependency but of\nsimple identity. What we have is one and the same reality,\nnot \u2018viewed from two different sides\u2019 or\n\u2018manifesting itself in two different forms\u2019, but\ndesignated by two different conceptual systems, the psychological and\nthe physical\u201d (ibid., p. 299). It was this very line of thought\nthat confirmed Feigl in his conviction that \u201cthe mind-body\nproblem is not a pseudoproblem\u201d (Feigl 1981, p. 349).\n\nThe essential question to be answered by an elaborated identity theory\nis, in Feigl\u2019s view, the following: \u201c[H]ow are the raw\nfeels related to behavioral (or neurophysiological) states?\u201d\n(1967, p. 5) By posing the question that way, Feigl excludes a\nreductive solution to the mind-body problem. More precisely, he\ndissociates himself from the \u201creductive fallacies\u201d (1981,\np. 16) of eliminative materialism and of radical behaviorism. On the\nother hand, however, Feigl is eager to demarcate his own position from\novertly\u2014metaphysically inspired\u2014dualistic conceptions,\nsuch as parallelism or epiphenomenalism. He explicitly opts for a\n\u201cmonistic solution\u201d (ibid., p. 298), arguing that the\ndualistic position would lead to an ungrounded \u201cduplication of\nrealities\u201d (1967, p. 94), whereas the\u2014scientifically\nwell-established\u2014principle of parsimony \u201cdoes oppose the\noperationistic predilection for speaking of two (or more) concepts if\nthe evidential facts, though completely correlated, are qualitatively\nheterogeneous\u201d (ibid.)\n\nOn the constructive side, Feigl\u2019s solution to the mind-body\nproblem might indeed be regarded as a direct continuation of the\nearlier \u2018double-language\u2019 conception presented by Schlick.\nLike in the case of the realism issue, Feigl attempts at a\nsemantically more sophisticated revision of the original Schlickian\npoint of view. One can even go further and say that it is the very\nsame terminology which is employed by Feigl in this connection. Thus,\njust like in the case of realism, Feigl categorically distinguishes\nthe evidential (or confirmatory) basis from the factual reference (or\ncontent) of the respective knowledge claims. Feigl writes:\n\nThe central core of the proposed solution rests upon the distinction\nbetween evidence and reference. No matter what indirect (behavioral)\nevidence we use for the ascription of mental states, the mental state\nascribed is not to be confused with the evidence which only leads\nsupport for the ascription. (Feigl 1967, p. 99)\n\n\nAccordingly, it is mental states which are to be regarded as the\nreferents of both psychological and physical terms. More precisely,\nFeigl assumes that, in the case of psychological terms, evidence is\nderived from (direct) knowledge by acquaintance, whereas in the case\nof physical (neurophysiological) terms evidence is derived from\n(indirect) knowledge by description (see Feigl 1967, p. 94). Yet, the\nreferent is in both cases the same, so that we have a relation of\n\u2018referential identity,\u2019 as in the context of Gottlob\nFrege\u2019s example of the terms \u2018morning star\u2019 and\n\u2018evening star\u2019 that differ in sense (Sinn), but\nnot in reference (Bedeutung), which in both cases is\nidentical, namely Venus (see, for this analogy, Feigl 1981, pp.\n346\u2013347). Consequently, we have two kinds of evidence for one\nand the same type of events. It is for this reason that Feigl\u2019s\nidentity theory is committed to a dualism at the evidential basis. Or,\nas Feigl puts it in \u201cThe \u2018Mental\u2019 and the\n\u2018Physical\u2019\u201d:\n\n[W]hat is had-in-experience, and (in the case of human\nbeings) knowable by acquaintance, is identical with the\nobject of knowledge by description provided first by molar\nbehavior theory and this in turn is identical with what the science of\nneurophysiology describes (or, rather, will describe when\nsufficient progress has been achieved) as processes in the central\nnervous system, perhaps especially in the cerebral cortex. In its\nbasic core this is the \u201cdouble knowledge\u201d theory held by\nmany modern monistic critical realists. (1967, p. 79)\n\n\nIn the footnote attached to this passage, Feigl refers the reader to\nthe views of Riehl, Schlick, Russell, and Roy Wood Sellars (among\nothers); and he then continues:\n\nThis view does not have the disadvantage of the Spinozistic doctrine\nof the unknown or unknowable third of which the mental and\nthe physical are aspects. The \u201cmental\u201d states or events\n(in the sense of raw feels) are the referents (denotata) of the\nphenomenal terms of the language of introspection, as well as of\ncertain terms of the neurophysiological language. For this reason I\nhave in previous publications called my view a \u201cdouble-language\ntheory.\u201d (ibid., pp. 79\u201380)\n\n\nThere are two peculiarities to be noticed in Feigl\u2019s version of\nthe double-language theory. First, it must be seen that qualia (raw\nfeels) are, for Feigl, the\u2014epistemologically\u2014basic\nreality. On his conception, we have privileged access to this\nbasic reality, so that (as Feigl points out in the postscript to\n\u201cThe \u2018Mental\u2019 and the \u2018Physical\u2019\u201d)\nthe \u201cegocentric account\u201d (ibid., p. 155) must be regarded\nas the most immediate mode of getting into contact with reality,\nwhereas \u201call scientific accounts [\u2026] deal with Being only\nindirectly and structurally\u201d (ibid.; see also Feigl 1981, pp. 17\nand 351). The privileged access to qualia (such as seeing red, feeling\npain, etc.) is, according to Feigl, accompanied by the use of\nindexical terms (such as \u201chere\u201d, \u201cnow\u201d,\n\u201cI\u201d, etc.) that in turn form part of a\n\u201cprivate\u201d (egocentric) language and which are\nsystematically analyzed in the context of the metalinguistic\ndiscipline of pure pragmatics (see Feigl 1967, p. 147). Thus, in\nFeigl\u2019s view, \u201cI must be able to know (by\n\u2018acquaintance\u2019) some phenomenal qualities and relations\n(redness, between-ness, etc.) in order to \u2018hook\u2019 (i.e.\nconnect) my private language to the intersubjective language of\nscience\u201d (ibid.). At the same time, he sees no problem in\ndescribing private mental states by intersubjective scientific\n(neurophysiological) terms. \u201cPrivacy,\u201d Feigl writes,\n\u201cis capable of public (intersubjective) description, and the\nobjects of intersubjective science can be evidenced by data of private\nexperience\u201d (ibid., p. 81). After all, Feigl is convinced of the\n\u201cindispensability of a subjectivistically understood conception\nof immediate (first person) experience\u201d (Feigl 1981, p. 353),\nwhich, on the one hand, entails a clear rejection of Ludwig\nWittgenstein\u2019s arguments against the possibility of a private\nlanguage (see Feigl 1981, p. 355), and, on the other hand, marks a\nsignificant contrast to the Australians\u2019 strategy of\n\u2018explaining away\u2019 the phenomenal properties of mental\nstates (see, in this connection, Stubenberg 1997, pp. 135\u2013136).\nThe possible objection that Feigl, by epistemologically privileging\nqualia, runs into the trap of panpsychism can be countered by the\nargument that all reality is, in fact, \u201cat bottom\nqualitative\u201d (Stubenberg 1997, p. 143). Thus, not only mental\nstates, but also the diverse physical magnitudes (like mass, pressure,\ngravitational field intensity, etc.) are distinguishable only by their\nqualitative peculiarities (see Feigl 1967, pp. 43\u201344; see\nfurther Schlick 1974, pp. 283\u2013285). But this does not imply that\nall reality is, like panpsychism would have it, intrinsically psychic.\nQualia form part of reality, but reality comprises more than only\nqualia. The point is that qualia (raw feels) are, for Feigl,\nepistemologically privileged as compared to ordinary objects and the\nentities posited by science. \u201cReference to one\u2019s own\nimmediate experience,\u201d Feigl (in an overtly Schlickian manner)\nwrites, \u201cis the (epistemological) prototype of all designations\nof objects, properties or relations by the words of our\nlanguage\u201d (1981, p. 355).\n\nThe second point to be noticed is that, according to Feigl\u2019s\nversion of the identity theory, the mode of ascertainment of\nthe identity of the mental (raw feels) and the physical (neural\nprocesses) is empirical in character. Had Feigl in his first\npublication on the mind-body problem in 1934 assumed that the\nrelationship between the mental and the physical is that of a\nlogical identity (thereby implying that the language of\npsychology can be fully translated into the language of physics,\nviz. neurophysiology), he, in his later writings, no longer\nconceived of that identity as a logically necessary, but as an\nempirical (contingent) kind of identity. This meant, in the first\nplace, that the corroboration of the philosophically outlined\nmonism had to be provided, not by philosophical analysis again, but by\nthe factual sciences themselves. \u201cOn the whole,\u201d Feigl\nconcluded:\n\nI should think, the available evidence points with remarkable\nconsistency in the direction of a system of psychology, psycho-physics\nand psychophysiology which provides for the monistic solution here\noutlined. But this is the empirical, the factual issue which\nphilosophical analysis cannot decide and should not prejudge. (Feigl\n1981, p. 298)\n\n\nThe sort of modesty displayed in passages like the above is very\ncharacteristic of Feigl\u2019s way of thinking. Just as in his\ndiscussion of the realism issue, he leaves it to the factual sciences\nto judge about the adequacy of his preferred philosophical position.\nHis methodological outlook can therefore be characterized as\n\u201cmetascientific\u201d (rather than metaphysical), in the sense\nthat \u201ca comprehensive reflection on the results of\nscience as well as on the logic and epistemology of scientific\nmethod\u201d (ibid., p. 349) is aspired to. However, the\ndecision between global philosophical stances, like realism and\nphenomenalism or, as concerns the mind-body problem, monism and\ndualism cannot be decided by empirical means, but only by a\n\u201cpragmatic justification\u201d (ibid., p. 294). In the case of\nthe identity theory, this pragmatic justification is, as has been\npointed out before, guided by the principle of parsimony.\n\nFeigl\u2019s approach to the mind-body problem became subject of\nextended controversy. While some authors directly contested the\nidentity thesis as such (see, for example, Abelson 1970 and Epstein\n1973; further the replies in Gr\u00fcnbaum 1972 and Nathanson 1972),\nothers urged that Feigl should clarify his conception of the relation\nof phenomenal predicates and \u201craw feels.\u201d Especially\nFeigl\u2019s Minnesota collaborator Paul Meehl argued along these\nlines, claiming that the main problem with Feigl\u2019s view stems\nfrom semantics (see Meehl 1966; further Aune 1966). On the whole, it\ncan be said that identity theory was discussed from various\nphilosophical perspectives. That Feigl left a considerable legacy can\nhardly be denied in this connection.\n",
