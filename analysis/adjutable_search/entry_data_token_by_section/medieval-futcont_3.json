    "main_text": "Interpreting Aristotle\n4. Later Medieval Views\n\nAn influential late medieval approach to future contingents was\nincluded in John Duns Scotus\u2019s theory of metaphysics as a\ntranscendental science in which the meaning of the univocal notion of\nbeing (ens) was defined as \u2018that to which to be is not\nrepugnant\u2019. Beings in this metaphysical sense are actual things\nas well as non-actual possible things, the imagined actuality of which\ndoes not include a contradiction. In the Augustinian tradition\nmetaphysical possibilities were ultimately based on the divine essence\nand represented the ways in which it could be imitated by created\nthings. According to Scotus, when God as an omniscient being knows all\npossibilities, he seemingly does not know them by turning first to his\nessence. Possibilities can be known in themselves; in fact, they would\nbe what they are even if there were no God. Scotus calls the\npropositional formulations of pure possibilities logical possibilities\n(possibile logicum). These express things and states of\naffairs to which it is not repugnant to be. Possibilities as such have\nno kind of existence of their own, but are real in the sense that they\nform the precondition for everything that is or can be. (For\nScotus\u2019s modal theory, see Vos et al. 1994; Knuuttila\n1996; Normore 1996, 2003; Honnefelder 2005.) Scotus takes it as an\nobvious fact that there are contingent states of affairs which could\nhave not been at that very moment of time at which they are\n(Ordinatio I.2.1.1\u20132, 86). This idea of simultaneous\nalternatives differed from the traditional view of the necessity of\nthe present and played and important role in Scotus\u2019s\nmetaphysics.\n\nAll possibilities of being receive intelligible or objective being as\nthe objects of God\u2019s knowledge. Some of these are included in\nGod\u2019s providential plan of creation and will receive actual\nbeing. The description of a possible state of affairs at a certain\nmoment consists of compossible possibilities. Since finite beings are\ncontingently actual, alternative possibilities are possible with\nrespect to the time of their actuality, but they are not compossible\nwith what is actual. According to Scotus, impossibilities are\nincompossibilities between possible ingredients, such as\nSocrates\u2019s sitting at a certain time and Socrates\u2019s not\nsitting at that same time (Lectura I.39.1\u20135, 62\u201363;\nOrdinatio I.35, 32, 49\u201351; I.36, 60\u20131; I.43, 5\u20137, 14).\n\nScotus\u2019s modal metaphysics incorporates many ideas similar to\nthose in the early medieval model developed by Abelard and the\nnominales, such as the denial of the necessity of the\npresent, the distinction between immutability and necessity and the\nuniversal validity of bivalence. Giving up the Thomistic view of the\natemporal presence of the flux of time to God, Scotus explains\nGod\u2019s knowledge of the truth-value of future contingent\npropositions as his knowing which of the possible scenarios will be\nactual and which will not (Lectura I.39.1\u20135, 44). The\ndefinite truth-values of the propositions about possible future events\ndo not make them necessary, many of these being acts of the will which\nas a free cause chooses between alternatives without being determined.\n(See Vos et al. 1994; S\u00f6der 1999; for some discussions\nof Scotus\u2019s view of the free acts of the will, see Dumont 2001;\nNormore 2003: 141\u2013145; Langston 2010.) \n\nScotus famously attempted to explain the contingency of God\u2019s\neternal choice by distinguishing between the instants of nature in\nGod\u2019s mind that represent conceptual succession without\nseparation or interval, for example, the instant of encountering\nopposite alternatives and the instant of choosing one of these. Future\ncontingent propositions founded on God\u2019s eternal choice are\ndeterminately true or false in such a way that they could be\notherwise, independently of whether they are known or not to humans\n(Ordinatio I.38.2, 426) These ideas are not found in\nScotus\u2019s early questions on Aristotle\u2019s De\ninterpretatione that mostly follow Boethius\u2019s views on\nfuture contingents, adding some more elaborated analyses of the\nstructure of future-tense propositions: they may signify that it is\ntrue now that something will be or signify that something will be\n(Opus 2.1.7\u20139). See the translations and commentary in\nBuckner and Zupko 2014. \n\nOckham followed Scotus in believing that God\u2019s choice could be\nother than it is and that future contingent propositions are true or\nfalse just as Scotus explicated, but he was dissatisfied with\nScotus\u2019s instants explanation, admitting that he did not have\nany of his own (Ordinatio d. 38, 578, 581, 584\u20135; Adams\n1987: 1130\u20131136. Ockham also criticized the view that God knows future free acts\nthrough his own acts of the will as their partial cause, which he,\nlike many of his contemporaries and later commentators, treated as\nScotus\u2019s position (Ordinatio d. 38, 582\u2013583). This was\nHenry of Ghent\u2019s view to which Scotus first subscribed but then\nqualified his acceptance. (See Hoenen 1993: 177\u2013179; S\u00f6der\n1999: 177\u2013183; Schabel 2000: 43\u201346.) Scotus thought that there\nare many contingent propositions known by God that are not simply\nchosen but rather permitted such as those about creaturely sins and\nother acts of free will (see Frost 2010).\n\nIn Scotus\u2019 theory, the synchronic alternatives of a future free\nact remain possibilities though not compossibilities at the instant of\nthat act. He thought that these \u201clogical potencies\u201d\nexpressed by propositions with non-repugnant terms are not sufficient\nfor freedom that requires \u201creal potencies\u201d for\nalternatives at an instant of time with respect to the same instant\n(see Dumont 1995). Ockham did not accept this part of Scotus\u2019s\ndenial of the necessity of the present, thinking that real capacities\nfor oppositions are diachronic (Ordinatio d. 38, 581). Opposite\nreal capacities without temporal succession at an instant were found\nproblematic by Thomas Wylton, an early critic of Scotus\u2019s ideas\nwho, while largely following Boethius, put forward some propositional\ndistinctions similar to those in Scotus\u2019s questions on De\ninterpretatione. See the edition and comments in Schabel 2011b;\nBornholdt 2017: 116\u2013120.\n\nOckham believed, as Scotus did, that future contingent propositions\nare true or false, that created wills are non-determined free causes,\nand that God knows contingent events without their being\nsimultaneously present to God. (For Ockham\u2019s view, see Adams and\nKretzmann 1983; Normore 1982.) While Scotus preferred to distinguish\nGod\u2019s eternal knowledge and choice from the temporal order\nsharply (Lectura I.39.1\u20132, n. 28, 85; Ordinatio I.40,\nn. 8), Ockham thought that they can be treated as temporally past.\nThis led him to ask how God\u2019s foreknowledge as something past\nand hence seemingly necessary is compatible with the contingency of\nfuture things. Ockham\u2019s answer was that even though God\u2019s\nforeknowledge is past, its content is future, and the past truth of\nfuture contingent propositions in God\u2019s immutable but contingent\nknowledge does not fall under the necessity of the past (Ordinatio\nd. 38, 387\u20138; Tractatus de praedestinatione\n515\u2013516). Many influential late thinkers embraced Ockham\u2019s\nview. (See Robert Holkot, Sent. II.2 in Seeing the Future\nClearly, 127, 145\u2013146; Gregory of Rimini, Lectura super I Sententiarum\nI.38.2.3 (302\u2013303); Pierre d\u2019Ailly, Quaestiones super libros Sententiarum I.11.3S.) This is also the hallmark of what is called the\nOckhamist view of divine foreknowledge in contemporary philosophical\ntheology (Zagzebski 1991: 66\u201397).\n\nWalter Chatton was a contemporary critic of Ockhams\u2019s views\nabout future contingents and divine knowledge. He also addressed the\ntheories of Scotus, Wylton, and particularly Peter Auriol, his main\nsource of inspiration, but mostly avoided formulating his own\nposition. For an English translation with a commentary of his main\ntreatise on future contingents, see Bornholdt 2017; see also the\n SEP entry on Walter Chatton.\n Peter Auriol put forward an original revision of the usual\ntheological position that while future contingent propositions were\nneither true nor false in Aristotle, this was not acceptable\nconcerning divine knowledge. Auriol argued that since these\npropositions lack a truth value, even God is aware of the future in an\n\u201cindistant\u201d way that does not imply that future contingent\npropositions should be treated as true or false. Auriol\u2019s\nindistant knowledge abstracts from temporality and simultaneity and is\nallegedly compatible with God\u2019s necessary immutability and human\nfree will (Schabel 2000: 67\u2013123). Auriol\u2019s position\ninspired much critical discussion until early sixteenth century. It\ncame to be regarded as heretical when a Papal commission made a\ndecision about the theses of Peter de Rivo, who defended a view\nsimilar to that of Auriol. Some of de Rivo\u2019s statements were\nofficially condemned in 1474 by Pope Sixtus IV (Baudry 1989 (ed.), La querelle des futurs contingents (Louvain 1465\u20131475). Textes in\u00e9dits; Schabel 1995\u201396, 2000:\n315\u2013336, 2003a).\n\nEnglish fourteenth-century authors often commented on the\nterminological distinctions between determinate and indeterminate\ntruth and falsity. Ockham characterized all prospective truths,\nwhether necessary or contingent, as immutable and therefore\ndeterminate, but there were other suggestions as well. Walter Burley,\nRichard of Campsall, Arnold of Strelley, and Robert Holkot preferred\nto call true propositions about future contingent things as\nindeterminately or contingently true. Some commentators have argued\nthat speaking about this special mode of being true or false was an\nattempt to modify bivalence by formulating an idea of many-valued\nlogic, see Normore 1982, 1993; Gelber 2004: 224\u2013250. For further\ntexts and studies on late medieval controversies related to\nforeknowledge, freedom and future contingents, see Genest 1992;\nSchabel 2003a, 2003b, 2007, 2011a, 2011b; Schabel, Friedman, and Balcoyiannopoulou\n2001; Rossini and Schabel 2005; Thakkar 2005, 2010. \n\nA central question for those who gave up the Thomist view was how God\ncan eternally know the acts of the will which is a free cause? An\ninfluential answer was offerred in the theory of middle knowledge by\nLuis de Molina (1535\u20131600). In addition to the knowledge of all\npossibilities and the possibilities which will be actualized in the\nprovidentially chosen history, God has a third kind of knowledge\n(scientia media), which comprises the hypothetical truths\nabout possible beings. In creating the world, God knows what possible\ncreatures would do in any possible situation (Freddoso 1988).\nMolina\u2019s \u2018middle knowledge\u2019 theory about\ncounterfactuals of freedom was actively debated in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth century and has remained a living issue in the philosophy\nof religion (Dekker 2000).\n",
