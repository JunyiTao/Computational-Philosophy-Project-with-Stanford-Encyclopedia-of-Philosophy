In order to establish the\nconservativeness of mathematics, the mathematical fictionalist has\nused metalogical results, such as the completeness and the compactness\nof first-order logic (Field 1992, 1980, 1989). The issue then arises\nas to whether the mathematical fictionalist can use these\nresults to develop the program.\nAt two crucial junctures, Field has made use of metalogical\nresults: (a) in his reformulation of the notion of conservativeness in\nnominalistically acceptable terms (Field 1989, pp. 119\u2013120;\nField 1991), and (b) in his nominalist proof of the conservativeness\nof set theory (Field 1992). These two outcomes are crucial for Field,\nsince they establish the adequacy of conservativeness for the\nmathematical fictionalist. For (a) settles that the latter can\nformulate that notion without violating nominalism, and (b) concludes\nthat conservativeness is a feature that mathematics actually has. But\nif these two outcomes are not legitimate, Field's approach cannot get\noff the ground. I will now consider whether these two uses of\nmetalogical results are acceptable on nominalist grounds.\n3.2.1 Conservativeness and the compactness theorem\nLet me start with (a). The mathematical fictionalist has relied on\nthe compactness theorem to formulate the notion\nof conservativeness in an acceptable way, that is, without\nreference to mathematical entities. As noted above, conservativeness\nis defined in terms of consistency. But this notion is\nusually formulated either in semantic terms (as the existence of an\nappropriate model), or in proof-theoretic terms (in terms of suitable\nproofs). However, as Field acknowledges, these two formulations of\nconsistency are platonist, since they depend on abstract objects\n(models and proofs), and therefore are not nominalistically\nacceptable.\nThe mathematical fictionalist way out is to avoid moving to the\nmetalanguage in order to express the conservativeness of\nmathematics. The idea is to state, in the object-language, the claim\nthat a given mathematical theory is conservative by introducing a\nprimitive notion of logical consistency: \u25caA. Thus,\nif B is any sentence, B* is the result of\nrestricting B to non-mathematical entities,\nand M1, \u2026, Mn are\nthe axioms of a mathematical theory M, the conservativeness\nof M can be expressed by the following schema (Field 1989,\np. 120):\n\n(C) If \u25caB, then \u25ca(B*\n  \u2227 M1 \u2227 \u2026\n  \u2227 Mn).\n\nIn other words, a mathematical theory M is conservative if\nit is consistent with every consistent theory about the physical\nworld B*.\nThis assumes, of course, that M is finitely axiomatized. But\nhow can we apply (C) in the case of mathematical theories that\nare not finitely axiomatizable (such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set\ntheory)? In this case, we cannot make the conjunction of all the\naxioms of the theory, since there are infinitely many of them. Field\nhas addressed this issue, and he initially suggested that the\nmathematical fictionalist could use substitutional quantification to\nexpress these infinite conjunctions (Field 1984). In a postscript to\nthe revised version of this essay (Field 1989, pp. 119\u2013120), he\nnotes that substitutional quantification can be avoided, provided that\nthe mathematical and physical theories in question are expressed in a\nlogic for which compactness holds. For in this case, the\nconsistency of the whole theory is reduced to the consistency of each\nof its finite conjunctions.\nThere are, however, three problems with this move.\n\nOne concern about the use of substitutional quantification in this context involves the nature of substitutional instances. If the latter turn out to be abstract, which would be the case if such substitutional instances were not mere inscriptions, they are not available to the nominalist. If the substitutional instances are concrete, the nominalist needs to show that there are enough of them.\nThe very statement of the compactness theorem involves set-theoretic talk: let G be a set of formulas; if every finite subset of G is consistent, then G is consistent. How can nominalists rely on a theorem whose very statement involves abstract entities? In order to use this theorem, an appropriate reformulation is required.\nLet us grant that it is possible to reformulate this statement without referring to sets. Can then the nominalist use the compactness theorem? As is well known, the proof of this theorem assumes set theory. The compactness theorem is usually presented as a corollary to the completeness theorem for first-order logic, whose proof assumes set theory (see, for example, Boolos and Jeffrey 1989, pp. 140\u2013141). Alternatively, if the compactness result is to be proved directly, then one has to construct the appropriate model of G\u2014which again requires set theory. So, unless mathematical fictionalists are able to provide an appropriate nominalization strategy for set theory itself, they are not entitled to use this result. In other words, far more work is required before a Field-type nominalist is able to rely on metalogical results.\n\nBut maybe this criticism misses the whole point of Field's\nprogram. As we saw, Field does not require that a mathematical\ntheory M be true for it to be used. Only\nits conservativeness is demanded. So, if M is added to\na body B* of nominalistic claims, no new nominalistic\nconclusion is obtained which was not obtained by B* alone. In\nother words, what Field's strategy asks for is the formulation of\nappropriate nominalistic bodies of claims to which\nmathematics can be applied. The same point holds for metalogical\nresults: provided that they are applied to nominalistic\nclaims, Field is fine.\nThe problem with this reply is that it involves the mathematical\nfictionalist program in a circle. The fictionalist cannot rely on\nthe conservativeness of mathematics to justify the use of a\nmathematical result (the compactness theorem) that is required for\nthe formulation of the notion of conservativeness itself. For\nin doing that, the fictionalist assumes that the notion of\nconservativeness is nominalistically acceptable, and this is exactly\nthe point in question. Recall that the motivation for Field to use the\ncompactness theorem was to reformulate conservativeness without having\nto assume abstract entities (namely, those required by the semantic\nand the proof-theoretic accounts of consistency). Thus, at this point,\nthe mathematical fictionalist cannot yet use the notion of\nconservativeness; otherwise, the whole program would not get off the\nground. I conclude that, similarly to any other part of mathematics,\nmetalogical results also need to be obtained nominalistically. Trouble\narises for nominalism otherwise.\n\n3.2.2 Conservativeness and primitive modality\nBut perhaps the mathematical fictionalist has a way out. As we saw,\nField spells out the notion of conservativeness in terms of a\nprimitive notion of logical consistency: \u25caA. And he also\nindicates that this notion is related to the model-theoretic concept\nof consistency\u2014in particular, to the formulation of this concept\nin von Neumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del finitely axiomatizable set theory\n(NBG). This is done via two principles (Field 1989, p. 108):\n\n(MTP#) If \u2610(NBG \u2192 there is a model for\n  \u2018A\u2019), then \u25caA\n(ME#) If \u2610(NBG \u2192 there is no model for\n  \u2018A\u2019), then \u00ac\u25caA.\n\nI am following Field's terminology: \u2018MTP#\u2019\nstands for model-theoretic possibility, and\n\u2018ME#\u2019 for model existence. The symbol\n\u2018#\u2019 indicates that, according to Field, these\nprinciples are nominalistically acceptable. After all, they are modal\nsurrogates for the platonistic principles (Field 1989,\npp. 103\u2013109):\n\n(MTP) If there is a model for \u2018A\u2019, then\n  \u25caA\n(ME) If there is no model for \u2018A\u2019, then\n  \u00ac\u25caA.\n\nIt may be argued that, by using these principles, the mathematical\nfictionalist will be entitled to use the compactness theorem. First,\none should try to state this theorem in a nominalistically acceptable\nway. Without worrying too much about details, let us grant, for the\nsake of argument, that the following characterization will do:\n\n(Compact#) If \u00ac\u25caT, then\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1,\n  \u2026, An[\u00ac\u25ca(A1\n  \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 An)],\n\nwhere T is a theory and each Ai, 1\n\u2264 i \u2264 n, is a formula (an axiom of T). The\nexpression\n\u2018\u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\u2019\nis to be read as \u2018there are finitely many\nformulas A1\u2026An\u2019. (This\nquantifier is not first-order. However, I am not going to press the\npoint that the nominalist seems to need a non-first-order\nquantifier to express a property typical of first-order\nlogic. This is only one of the worries we are leaving aside in this\nformulation.) This version is parasitic on the following platonistic\nformulation of the compactness theorem:\n\n(Compact) If there is no model for T, then\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1,\n  \u2026, An such that there is no model\n  for (A1 \u2227 \u2026\n  \u2227 An).\n\nIn order for mathematical fictionalists to be entitled to use the\ncompactness theorem, they will have to show that the nominalistic\nformulation (Compact#) follows from the platonistic one\n(Compact). In this sense, if the latter is adequate, so is the\nformer. More accurately, what has to be shown is that\n(Compact#) follows from a modal surrogate of\n(Compact). After all, since what is at issue is the legitimacy of the\ncompactness theorem on nominalist grounds, it would be\nquestion-begging to assume the full platonistic version from the\noutset. As we will see, there are two ways to try to establish this\nresult. Unfortunately, none of them works: both are formally\ninadequate.\nThe two options start in the same way. Suppose that\n\n(1) \u00ac\u25caT.\n\nWe have to establish that\n\n(2)\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\n  \u00ac\u25ca(A1\u2227\u2026\u2227An).\n\nIt follows from (1) and (MTP#) that\n\n(3) \u00ac\u2610(NBG \u2192 there is a model for\n  \u2018T\u2019),\n\nand thus\n\n(4) \u25ca(NBG \u2227 there is no model for\n  \u2018T\u2019).\n\nLet us assume the modal surrogate for the compactness theorem:\n\n(CompactM) \u2610(NBG \u2192 if there is no model for\n  \u2018T\u2019, then\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\n  such that there is no model for\n  (A1\u2227\u2026\u2227An)).\n\nNote that, since the modal surrogate is formulated in terms of\nmodels (rather than in terms of the primitive modal operator), it is\nstill not what mathematical fictionalists need. What they need is\n(Compact#), but one needs to show that they can get it. At\nthis point, the options begin to diverge.\nThe first option consists in drawing from (4) and\n(CompactM) that\n\n(5)\n  \u25ca(\u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\n  such that there is no model for (A1\n  \u2227\u2026\u2227 An)).\n\nThere are, however, difficulties with this move. First, note that\n(5) is not equivalent to (2), which is the result to be\nachieved. Moreover, as opposed to (2), (5) is formulated in\nmodel-theoretic terms, since it incorporates a claim about the\nnonexistence of a certain model. And what is required is a similar\nstatement in terms of the primitive notion of consistency. In\nother words, we need the nominalistic counterpart of (5), rather than\n(5).\nBut (5) has a nice feature. It is a modalized formulation of the\nconsequent of (Compact). And since (5) only states\nthe possibility that there is no model of a particular kind,\nit may be argued that it is nominalistically acceptable. (As\nwill be examined below, modal structuralists advance a nominalization\nstrategy exploring modality along these lines; see Hellman (1989).)\nField, however, is skeptical about this move. On his view, modality is\nnot a general surrogate for ontology (Field 1989,\npp. 252\u2013268). And one of his worries is that by allowing the\nintroduction of modal operators, as a general nominalization strategy,\nwe modalize away the physical content of the theory under\nconsideration. However, since metalogical claims are not expected to\nhave physical consequences, the worry need not arise here. At any\nrate, given that (5) does not establish what needs to be established,\nit does not solve the problem.\nThe second option consists in moving to (5\u2032) instead of\n(5):\n\n(5\u2032) \u2610(NBG \u2192\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\n  such that there is no model for (A1\n  \u2227\u2026\u2227 An)).\n\nNote that if (5\u2032) were established, we would have settled the\nmatter. After all, with a straightforward reworking of\n(ME#) (namely, If \u2610(NBG \u2192\n\u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\nsuch that there is no model for\n(A1\u2227\u2026\u2227An)),\nthen \u00ac\u25ca(A1\n\u2227\u2026\u2227 An)), it follows from\n(5\u2032) and (ME#) that\n\n(2)\n  \u2203f\u00a0A1\u2026An\n  \u00ac\u25ca(A1\n  \u2227\u2026\u2227 An),\n\nwhich is the conclusion we need. The problem here is that\n(5\u2032) does not follow from (4) and\n(CompactM). Therefore, we cannot derive it.\nClearly, there may well be another option that establishes the\nintended conclusion. But, to say the least, the mathematical\nfictionalist has to present it before being entitled to use metalogic\nresults. Until then, it is not clear that these results are\nnominalistically acceptable.\n3.2.3 Metalogic and the proof of the conservativeness of set theory\nI should now consider issue (b): Field's nominalistic proof of the\nconservativeness of set theory. Let us grant that the concept of\nconservativeness has been formulated in some nominalistically\nacceptable way. If Field's proof were correct, he would have proved\nthat mathematics itself is conservative\u2014as long as one assumes\nthe usual reductions of mathematics to set theory. How does Field\nprove the conservativeness of set theory? It is by an ingenious\nargument, which adapts one of the Field's platonistic conservativeness\nproofs (Field 1980). For our present purposes, we need not examine the\ndetails of this argument, but simply note that at a crucial point the\ncompleteness of first-order logic is used to establish its conclusion\n(Field 1992, p. 118).\nThe problem with this move is that, even if mathematical\nfictionalists formulate the statement of the completeness theorem\nwithout referring to mathematical entities, the proof of this\ntheorem assumes set theory (see, for instance, Boolos and Jeffrey\n1989, pp. 131\u2013140). Therefore, fictionalists cannot use the\ntheorem without undermining their nominalism. After all, the point of\nproviding a nominalistic proof of the conservativeness of set theory\nis to show that, without recourse to platonist mathematics, the\nmathematical fictionalist is able to establish that mathematics is\nconservative. Field has offered a platonist argument for the\nconservativeness result (Field 1980)\u2014an argument that explicitly\ninvoked properties of set theory. The idea was to provide\na reductio of platonism: by using platonist mathematics,\nField attempted to establish that mathematics was conservative and,\nthus, ultimately dispensable. In contrast with the earlier strategy,\nthe goal was to provide a proof of the conservativeness of set theory\nthat a nominalist could accept. But since the nominalistic proof\nrelies on the completeness theorem, it is not at all clear that it is\nin fact nominalist. Mathematical fictionalists should first be able to\nprove the completeness result without assuming set\ntheory. Alternatively, they should provide a nominalization strategy\nfor set theory itself, which will then entitle them to use metalogical\nresults.\nBut it may be argued that the mathematical fictionalist only\nrequires the conservativeness of the set theory in which the\ncompleteness theorem is proved. It should now be clear that this reply\nis entirely question begging, since the point at issue is exactly\nto prove the conservativeness of set theory. Thus, the\nfictionalist cannot assume that this result is already established at\nthe metatheory.\nIn other words, without a broader nominalization strategy, which\nallows set theory itself to be nominalized, it seems difficult to see\nhow mathematical fictionalists can use metalogical results as part of\ntheir program. The problem, however, is that it is not at all obvious\nthat, at least in the form articulated by Field, the mathematical\nfictionalist program can be extended to set theory. For it only\nprovides a nominalization strategy for scientific theories,\nthat is, for the use of mathematics in science (e.g., in\nNewtonian gravitational theory). The approach doesn't address the\nnominalization of mathematics itself.\nIn principle, one may object, this shouldn't be a problem. After\nall, the mathematical fictionalists\u2019 motivation to develop their\napproach has focused on one issue: to overcome the indispensability\nargument\u2014thus addressing the use of mathematics\nin science. And the overall strategy, as noted, has been to\nprovide nominalist counterparts to relevant scientific theories.\nThe problem with this objection, however, is that given the nature\nof Field's strategy, the task of nominalizing science cannot be\nachieved without also nominalizing set theory. Thus, what is needed is\na more open-ended, broader nominalism: one that goes hand in hand not\nonly with science, but also with metalogic. As it stands, the\nmathematical fictionalist approach still leaves a considerable\ngap.\n",
