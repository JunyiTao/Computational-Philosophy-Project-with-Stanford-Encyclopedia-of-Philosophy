    "main_text": "Replies to Bradleyean Arguments || Mutual Interdependence of Constituents\n3.4 Mutual Interdependence of Constituents\n\nIn \u201cFunction and Concept\u201d (1891), Frege famously described\na concept-object distinction as a special case of the\nfunction-argument distinction. Concepts, according to Frege, were\nunsaturated and incomplete entities, in need of completion by objects.\nBecause of such natures of concepts and objects, the two would\npresumably \u201cfit\u201d together without any intermediaries.\n\nTaking a cue from Frege, some philosophers have argued in favor of a\ntwo-sided dependence of constituents of states of affairs (and a\nmany-sided dependence of property tropes in trope bundles) as a\nnon-relational way of accounting for the unity of such complexes.\nBaxter (2001), for instance, has proposed that the unity of particular\nand universal should be analyzed as partial identity. For\nBaxter, both particulars and universals have \u201caspects\u201d.\nDifferent instances of one and the same universal are different\naspects of a universal; spatial parts of particulars are\ntheir different aspects. Particulars and universals can be\npartially identical by overlapping in their aspects. Baxter writes:\n\n\n\nSuppose Hume is a particular, Benevolence is a universal, and Hume is\nbenevolent. Then Hume has as an aspect, Hume insofar as he is\nbenevolent. Also Benevolence has as an aspect, Benevolence insofar as\nHume has it. These are the same aspect\u2014Hume\u2019s benevolence.\n(Baxter 2001: 454)\n\n\nHume\u2019s benevolence in Baxter\u2019s example is what\nArmstrong calls a state of affairs. In fact, Armstrong was\ntemporarily swayed by Baxter\u2019s partial identity view of\nstates of affairs, but then went on to object to the view on the\ngrounds that partial identity cannot be merely contingent. Thus, for\nlater Armstrong, \u201conce one has identity, even if only partial\nidentity, there will be found necessity\u201d (Armstrong 2005: 317).\nA particular, thus, necessarily has all the properties that\nit in fact has, and the universal necessarily has the\ninstances that it has. This outcome secures the unity of particulars\nand universals but at a cost of embracing a strong version of\nnecessitarianism.\n\nInspired by earlier Armstrong, Perovic (2016) has proposed a\nnon-necessitarian dependence model for particulars and universals in\nstates of affairs. On this model, the constituents of most states of\naffairs such as this chalk being white exhibit mutual\ngeneric existential dependence. This simply captures the idea\nthat a particular piece of chalk presumably cannot exist without\nhaving some color or other, it is generically existentially dependent\nupon some color universal. Similarly, the universal whiteness\nis generically existentially dependent on some concrete\nparticular, for it cannot exist without inhering in some concrete\nparticular or other, but it need not be the particular piece of chalk\na. However, the state of affairs this particular chalk\nbeing white exhibits the strongest kind of dependence on its\nconstitutive particular and universal\u2014namely, it seems to\nexhibit one-sided specific existential dependence on its\nconstituents. The reason why specific states of affairs seem to\nexhibit such strong existential dependence, is because of the simple\nfact that any change in a particular or in a universal would bring\nabout a different state of affairs. \n\nSimons (1994) put forward a similar proposal within the framework of\nhis \u201cnuclear theory\u201d of tropes. He thinks of bundles of\ntropes as having different levels of unity. Property tropes that are\nessential to a particular are tightly woven through mutual dependence\non one another, whereas property tropes that are accidental are more\nloosely dependent upon the tight bundle tropes in the nucleus.\n\nOne might find these sorts of proposals wanting since they only\ncharacterize the types of dependence that hold between constituents of\nunified wholes (whether they are states of affairs or nuclear bundles\nof tropes). But, the objection goes, they do not account for the\ndifference between constituents considered outside of such unities and\nconstituents in a unified whole. Here, Perovic (2016) is happy to\nadmit that she is not trying to provide such an account in the first\nplace. Following Armstrong, she takes the world to be exhausted by\nstates of affairs and takes particulars and universals to exist only\nin states of affairs.\n",
