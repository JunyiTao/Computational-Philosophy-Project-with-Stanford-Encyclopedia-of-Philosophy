    "main_text": "Natures and the four causes\n1. Natures and the four causes\n\nNature, according to Aristotle, is an inner principle of change and\nbeing at rest (Physics 2.1, 192b20\u201323). This means that\nwhen an entity moves or is at rest according to its nature reference\nto its nature may serve as an explanation of the event. We have to\ndescribe how\u2014to what extent, through what other processes, and\ndue to what agency\u2014the preconditions for the process of change\nor of being at rest are present, but once we have provided an account\nof these preconditions, we have given a complete account of the\nprocess. The nature of the entity is in and of itself sufficient to\ninduce and to explain the process once the relevant circumstances do\nnot preempt it.\n\nNatures as inner principles of change and rest are contrasted with\nactive powers or potentialities (dunameis), which are\nexternal principles of change and being at rest (Metaphysics\n9.8, 1049b5\u201310), operative on the corresponding internal passive\ncapacities or potentialities (dunameis again,\nMetaphysics 9.1, 1046a11\u201313). When a change, or a state\nof rest, is not natural, both the active and the passive potentiality\nneed to be specified. Natures, then, in a way do double duty: once a\nnature is operative, neither a further active, nor a further passive\ncapacity needs to be invoked. Even so, as will be clear from\nAristotle\u2019s discussion, this general thesis will require a host\nof qualifications.\n\nBecause natures\u2014beside the active and passive\npotentialities\u2014are ultimate grounds in causal explanations,\nAristotle sets out how they are integrated with the doctrine of\ncausation.\n\nAn explanation for a state of affairs must specify some feature or\nsome object (in general, some abstract or concrete entity) which is\nresponsible for it. The entity responsible is, Aristotle submits, a\ncause (aitia or aition, words used interchangeably\nby\n Aristotle).[4]\n Different explanations of a single state of affairs are possible, and\nindeed usually necessary, because there are different ways of being\nresponsible for distinct facets of the same state of affairs. The\nvarieties of responsibilities are grouped by Aristotle under four\nheadings, the so-called four causes.\n\nThe first two of these are matter and form, what an entity is made up\nfrom according to Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphic analysis.\nUnderstandably, both of them can be responsible for the features and\nthe behaviour of the entity they make up. Hylomorphic analysis,\ntogether with the separation of the material and formal causes as\ndistinct types, implies that if something is explicable in terms of\nmatter or form, explanations in terms of form will be different in\nkind from those given in terms of matter. As a rule there is a\ncollaboration between these causes: matter provides the potentialities\nwhich are actualised by the form. Accordingly, these causally relevant\nentities give rise to a hierarchic structure of\n explanation.[5]\n In order for a form to be realised, one needs to have suitable\nmatter. This suitable matter brings with it the features required by a\ngiven hylomorphic composite. These features, then, are on the one hand\nthe contribution of the matter, and as such the matter is the\n(material) cause of these features of the composite entity, whereas on\nthe other hand they are indispensable presuppositions for the\nrealisation of the form, and to that extent their presence is prompted\nby the\n form.[6]\n Such dependency relations between matter and form are labelled by\nAristotle as cases of hypothetical necessity. Aristotle sometimes\nillustrates his point by appealing to the matter required for the\nconstruction of a house. If there is a house to be built, one needs\nbuilding bricks, slabs, mortar, etc. Each part provides material with\nproperties within a definite range of the sort required for a house to\ncome into being. A house cannot, for example, be made out of liquid\nwater. That sort of matter would provide potentialities not suited for\nthe form of house.\n\nExplanations often specify entities beyond the role played by the\nmatter and the form of the entity itself. These cases are grouped by\nAristotle as efficient or moving causes on the one hand and as final\ncauses on the other. Efficient causes operate in a straightforward\nmanner by initiating processes and bringing about their effects,\nwhereas final causes account for processes and entities by being what\nthese processes and entities are for, what they objectively intend to\n attain.[7]\n The fact that the role of efficient causes is not identical to that\nof the matter and the form of the entity whose features they are to\nexplain does not require that every instance of efficient causation\nmust issue from outside the entity moved. On the contrary, an\nefficient cause can also be internal. In cases in which the efficient\ncause is internal, it will be, in its specific function, one of the\nparts, or even the formal aspect, of the entity caused to move.\n\nNatures, understandably, can feature in any of these four causal\nfunctions. However, when the matter of an entity functions as its\nnature\u2014i.e., when its natural motion and rest are explained in\nterms of the matter it is made of\u2014this matter must possess some\ncausally relevant features, bestowed upon it by its own formal\naspect.\n\nThis role of matter can be contrasted to the causal role of the three\nfurther types of causes\u2014of form, of efficient cause, and of\nfinal cause, respectively. This is so, because, as Aristotle adds,\nform and final cause often coincide. Moreover, when a nature is\nspecified as a first efficient cause, cause and effect are the same in\nform (or in species), though this is not to say that one and the same\nentity causes itself and is caused through its own causal efficacy\n(Physics 2.7, 198a24\u201327, cf. Metaphysics 8.4,\n1044a32\u2013b1).\n\nAs internal principles of moving and rest, natures stand in an\nexclusive relationship to the efficient or moving causes of the\nmotions and rests they bring about: in some cases when Aristotle is\nnot specifying the first moving cause, he can assert the identity of\nnature and moving cause. Accordingly, the soul of living beings will\nbe identified as the substance (i.e., form) and the moving cause of\nthe organism whose soul it\n is.[8]\n But the identification, even in this restricted sense, will need some\nfurther important qualifications, to which we will return in\n Section 5\n below, on movers and unmoved movers.\n",
