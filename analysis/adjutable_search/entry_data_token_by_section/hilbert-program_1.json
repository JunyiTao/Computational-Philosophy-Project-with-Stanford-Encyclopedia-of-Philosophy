    "main_text": "Historical development of Hilbert\u2019s Program || The influence of Principia Mathematica\n1.2 The influence of Principia Mathematica\n\nThe publication of Russell and Whitehead\u2019s\n Principia Mathematica\n provided the required logical basis for a renewed attack on\nfoundational issues. Beginning in 1914, Hilbert\u2019s student\nHeinrich Behmann and others studied the system of Principia\n(see\n Mancosu 1999\n on Behmann\u2019s role in Hilbert\u2019s school). Hilbert himself\nreturned to work on foundational issues in 1917. In September 1917, he\ndelivered an address to the Swiss Mathematical Society entitled\n\u201cAxiomatic Thought\u201d\n (1918a).\n It is his first published contribution to mathematical foundations\nsince 1905. In it, he again emphasizes the requirement of consistency\nproofs for axiomatic systems: \u201cThe chief requirement of the\ntheory of axioms must go farther [than merely avoiding known\nparadoxes], namely, to show that within every field of knowledge\ncontradictions based on the underlying axiom-system are absolutely\nimpossible.\u201d He poses the proof of the consistency of\narithmetic (and of set theory) again as the main open problems. In\nboth these cases, there seems to be nothing more fundamental available\nto which the consistency could be reduced other than logic itself. And\nHilbert then thought that the problem had essentially been solved by\nRussell\u2019s work in Principia. Nevertheless, other\nfundamental problems of axiomatics remained unsolved, including the\nproblem of the \u201cdecidability of every mathematical\nquestion,\u201d which also traces back to Hilbert\u2019s 1900\naddress.\n\nThese unresolved problems of axiomatics led Hilbert to devote\nsignificant effort to work on logic in the following years. In 1917,\nPaul Bernays joined him as his assistant in G\u00f6ttingen. In a\nseries of courses from 1917\u20131921, Hilbert, with the assistance\nof Bernays and Behmann, made significant new contributions to formal\nlogic. The course from 1917\n (Hilbert, 1918b),\n in particular, contains a sophisticated development of first-order\nlogic, and forms the basis of Hilbert and Ackermann\u2019s textbook\nPrinciples of Theoretical Logic\n (1928)\n (see\n Ewald and Sieg 2013,\n Sieg 1999, and Zach\n 1999,\n 2003).\n",
