    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Moral Motivation\n6.5 Moral Motivation\n\n\nIn his moral theory Reid attempts to draw from the rationalist\ntradition of Samuel Clarke and Richard Price and from the\nsentimentalist tradition of David Hume and Adam Smith. As a result,\nhis conception of the relationship between moral motivation and moral\naction is complex and difficult to unify. Motives appear to Reid to be\nboth the ends for which we act, and the mental states that prompt our\nactive behavior (Cuneo 2011).\n\n\nIn the first of the two passages below, both drawn from Active\nPowers, Reid implies that moral judgments about an action are not\nnecessarily connected to any moral motivation while in the second he\nasserts that moral judgments about an action are necessarily connected\nto moral motivation:\n\nA judge, from a regard to justice, and to the duty of his\noffice, dooms a criminal to die, while, from humanity or particular\naffection, he desires that he should live... The determination of the\nmind may be, not to do what we desire to do. (EAP\n2.1, 49)\nI am very apt to think, with Dr Price, that, in intelligent beings,\nthe desire of what is good, and aversion to what is ill, is\nnecessarily connected with the intelligent nature; and that it is a\ncontradiction to suppose such a being to have the notion of good\nwithout the desire of it, or the notion of ill without aversion to\nit. (EAP 3.3.2, 156)\n\n\n\nOne means by which to interpret these passages is through the lens of\na teleological and theistic account of moral perception (Cuneo\n2002). On this model, when we are functioning properly in the\nenvironments for which God designed us, then moral judgments are\naccompanied by moral motivations to act. However, this connection will\nfail in those who are damaged or poorly designed. For example,\npsychopaths suffer impairment in emotional response. Psychopaths can\nknow certain of their behaviors are outside standard morality and yet\nnot be motivated to alter their behavior. This, and the \u2018proper\nfunction\u2019 interpretation of the relation between moral judgment and\nmoral motivation, is suggested in Reid's remark about the\ndepraved:\nNor can we conceive a greater depravity in the heart of\nman, than it would be to see and acknowledge worth without feeling any\nrespect to it; or to see and acknowledge the highest worthlessness\nwithout any degree of dislike and indignation. (EAP 3.3.7,\n181)\n\n\nReid's account of moral motivation exemplifies his philosophical style\nin general, which eschews a priori speculation, the crafting of\nuniversal generalizations, and necessary and sufficient conditions in\nfavor of keeping close to his observations of others and his\nintrospection about himself. In the present context, Reid's account of\nmoral motivation does not endorse any universal generalizations about\nwhat does and does not motivate us to moral action. What this\nsacrifices in philosophical clarity it, perhaps, gains in its ability\nto respond to real life cases. (For more on Reid's moral philosophy,\nsee\n Reid's Ethics.)\n",
