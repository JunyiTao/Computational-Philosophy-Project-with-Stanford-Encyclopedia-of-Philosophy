    "main_text": "\n\nEvolutionary game theory originated as an application of the\nmathematical theory of games to biological contexts, arising from the\nrealization that frequency dependent fitness introduces a strategic\naspect to evolution. Recently, however, evolutionary game theory has\nbecome of increased interest to economists, sociologists, and\nanthropologists--and social scientists in general--as well as\nphilosophers. The interest among social scientists in a theory with\nexplicit biological roots derives from three facts. First, the\n\u2018evolution\u2019 treated by evolutionary game theory need not\nbe biological evolution. \u2018Evolution\u2019 may, in this context,\noften be understood as cultural evolution, where this refers\nto changes in beliefs and norms over time. Second, the rationality\nassumptions underlying evolutionary game theory are, in many cases,\nmore appropriate for the modelling of social systems than those\nassumptions underlying the traditional theory of games. Third,\nevolutionary game theory, as an explicitly dynamic theory, provides an\nimportant element missing from the traditional theory. In the preface\nto Evolution and the Theory of Games, Maynard Smith notes\nthat \u201c[p]aradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is\nmore readily applied to biology than to the field of economic\nbehaviour for which it was originally designed.\u201d It is perhaps\ndoubly paradoxical, then, that the subsequent development of\nevolutionary game theory has produced a theory which holds\ngreat promise for social scientists, and is as readily applied to the\nfield of economic behaviour as that for which it was originally\ndesigned.\n",
