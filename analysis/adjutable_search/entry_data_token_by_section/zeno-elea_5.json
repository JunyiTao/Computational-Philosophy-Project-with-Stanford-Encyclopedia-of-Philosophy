    "main_text": "The Extant Paradoxes || Other Paradoxes\n3. Zeno\u2019s Purposes\n\n\nThe commonly found claim that Zeno aimed to defend the paradoxical \nmonism of his Eleatic mentor, Parmenides, is based upon the \nspeculations by the young Socrates of Plato\u2019s Parmenides on \nZeno\u2019s ulterior motives. After the portion of the exchange between \nSocrates and Zeno quoted above (sect. 1), Socrates turns to \nParmenides and says:\n\n\nIn a way, he has written the same thing as you, but he\u2019s changed it\naround to try to fool us into thinking that he\u2019s saying something\ndifferent. For you say in the verses you\u2019ve composed that the all is\none, and you do a fine and good job of providing proofs of this. He,\non the other hand, says there are not many things, and he too provides\nnumerous and powerful proofs. Given that one says \u201cone\u201d\nand the other \u201cnot many,\u201d and that each speaks in this way\nso as to appear to have said none of the same things, when you are in\nfact saying virtually the same thing, what you\u2019ve said seems said in a\nway that\u2019s beyond the powers of the rest of\nus. (Pl. Prm. 128a6\u2013b6)\n\n\nSocrates virtually accuses Zeno of having plotted with Parmenides to \nconceal the fundamental identity of their conclusions. With so many \nreaders of Plato accustomed to taking Socrates as his mouthpiece in \nthe dialogues, it is not surprising that this passage has served as \nthe foundation for the common view of Zeno as Parmenidean legatee and\ndefender, by his own special means, of Eleatic orthodoxy. \nUnfortunately, this use of the Platonic evidence is unjustifiably \nselective, even prejudicial, in the weight it accords the words put \nin Socrates\u2019 mouth. Plato immediately has Zeno disabuse Socrates of \nhis suspicions about the book\u2019s ulterior purpose. \n\n\nZeno this time replies that Socrates has not altogether grasped the \ntruth about his book. First, he says, the book had nothing like the \npretensions Socrates has ascribed to it (Prm. 128c2\u20135). Zeno\nis made to explain his actual motivation as follows:\n\n\nThe treatise is in truth a sort of support for Parmenides\u2019 doctrine\nagainst those attempting to ridicule it on the ground that, if one is,\nthe doctrine suffers many ridiculous consequences that contradict it.\nThis treatise, therefore, argues against those who say the many are,\nand it pays them back with the same results and worse, intending to\ndemonstrate that their hypothesis \u201cif many are\u201d suffers\neven more ridiculous consequences than the hypothesis of there being\none, if one pursues the issue sufficiently. (Pl. Prm.\n128c6\u2013d6)\n\n\nZeno\u2019s account of how he defended Parmenides against those who \nridiculed him is designed to correct Socrates\u2019 mistaken impression \nthat Zeno was basically just arguing for the same thing as \nParmenides, that the all is one. Zeno is portrayed as trying to \ncorrect this mistaken view of his purposes as born of a superficial \nunderstanding of Parmenides\u2019 doctrine. Zeno\u2019s arguments against \nplurality will seem to entail Parmenides\u2019 doctrine only if his \nthesis, \u201cone is\u201d (hen esti), is taken to mean \nthat only one thing exists. However, the elaborate examination of \nthis very thesis, \u201cone is\u201d (hen esti), by \nParmenides himself in the latter part of the dialogue shows that \nPlato thinks it is not to be understood in any such trivial sense. \nFor not only does Parmenides end up examining the relation of his One\nto other things, which would have been impossible if his doctrine \nentailed their non-existence, but the relation other things have to \nthe One actually proves responsible in a way for their existence. \nZeno cannot be supposing that his arguments against plurality \nentailed the doctrine of Parmenides when that doctrine is represented\nin this same dialogue by Parmenides himself as something altogether \nmore involved than the simple thesis that only one thing exists. \nNevertheless, Zeno\u2019s description of the persons who attempted to \nridicule Parmenides is perfectly compatible with their \nhaving understood the thesis, \u201cone is\u201d (hen \nesti), as an assertion that only one thing exists. Zeno\u2019s \narguments constitute an indirect defense of \nParmenides\u2014\u201ca sort of support\u201d (bo\u00eatheia \ntis, 128c6)\u2014because they do nothing to disabuse his \ndetractors of their superficial understanding of his doctrine. \nInstead, as Zeno says, he tried to show that the assumption that \nthere are many things has consequences every bit as unpalatable as \nthose Parmenides\u2019 critics suppose his position has (cf. Procl. in\nPrm. 619.15\u201321). Thus, while Zeno accepts Socrates\u2019 point that \nhis own arguments aim to show that there are not many things, he \ncorrects Socrates\u2019 impression that, in arguing this point, he was \njust saying the same thing as Parmenides in a different form. \n\n\nThe evidence of Plato\u2019s Parmenides, then, does not license \nthe conventional view that Zeno\u2019s arguments against plurality and \nmotion were intended to support the strict monism of Parmenides. \nClaims to the contrary have rested upon selective and prejudicial use\nof this evidence due to the tendency to privilege Socrates\u2019 remarks \non Zeno\u2019s purposes over Zeno\u2019s own qualifications and corrections of \nthat analysis. What Plato actually suggests is that Zeno aimed to \nshow those whose superficial understanding of Parmenides had led them\nto charge him with flying in the face of common sense, that common \nsense views concerning unity and plurality are themselves riddled \nwith latent contradictions. Such is, essentially, the judgment of \nJonathan Barnes: \u201cZeno was not a systematic Eleatic solemnly \ndefending Parmenides against philosophical attack by a profound and \ninterconnected set of reductive argumentations. Many men had mocked \nParmenides: Zeno mocked the mockers. His logoi were designed\nto reveal the inanities and ineptitudes inherent in the ordinary \nbelief in a plural world; he wanted to startle, to amaze, to \ndisconcert. He did not have the serious metaphysical purpose of \nsupporting an Eleatic monism\u201d (Barnes 1982, 236). However, \nwhether the historical Zeno was actually involved in anything like \nthe dialectical context Plato envisages for him must remain \nuncertain. Even if there were already in Zeno\u2019s day individuals who \nmistook Parmenides\u2019 position for the thesis that only one thing \nexists, the idea that Zeno\u2019s arguments were motivated by a desire to \nrespond to such individuals in kind is as historically unverifiable \nas the claim Plato puts in his mouth that his book was stolen and \ncirculated before he could decide for himself whether to make his \narguments public (Pl. Prm. 128d7\u2013e1). \n\n\nNevertheless, just as Socrates\u2019 initial remark that Zeno\u2019s \narguments were all designed to show that there are not in fact many \nthings remains basically plausible, so there are elements in Zeno\u2019s \naccount of his own purposes that have the ring of historical truth \nand that square well with other evidence. Plato has Zeno continue his\nsecond response to Socrates (quoted above) by saying, \u201cIt was \nwritten by me in such a contentious spirit when I was still young. \n\u2026 You are mistaken in this regard, then, Socrates, that you suppose\nit was written, not under the influence of youthful contentiousness, \nbut under that of a more mature ambition\u201d (Pl. Prm. \n128d6\u2013e3). The point is repeatedly made that Zeno\u2019s book was written \nin a spirit of youthful contentiousness or \u201clove of \nvictory\u201d (philonikia, Prm. 128d7, e2). The \nmore mature Zeno seems a little embarrassed by the combative manner \nevident in the arguments of his younger days, as well he might since \nthat spirit would have come to be seen as typical of the eristic \ncontroversialists who sprang up in the sophistic era. Plato gives yet\nanother nod to the idea that Zeno was a forerunner of eristic \ncontentiousness when he has him say that his book \u201ccontradicts \n(antilegei) those who say the many are\u201d (Prm.\n128d2\u20133). This suggestion that Zeno was a practitioner of what came \nto be known as \u201cantilogic,\u201d or the art of contradiction, \nis consistent with Plato\u2019s representation of him in other dialogues \nas something of a sophist. In the Alcibiades, Socrates \nreports that Pythodorus and Callias each paid Zeno a hundred minae to\nbecome clever and skilled in argument (Alc. 119a3\u20136; cf. \nPrm. 126b\u2013c). Teaching for payment is of course one hallmark\nof the professional educators who styled themselves experts in \nwisdom. That Plato saw Zeno as a practitioner of the specific brand \nof argument known as antilogic is evidenced by the \nPhaedrus\u2019s famous description of him as the \n\u201cEleatic Palamedes\u201d for his ability to make the same \nthings appear to his audience both like and unlike, one and many, \nmoving and at rest (Phdr. 261d6\u20138). Again, at the beginning \nof the Sophist, when Theodorus introduces the Eleatic \nVisitor as an associate of Parmenides and Zeno and their followers, \nSocrates expresses concern that the Visitor may be \u201csome god of\nrefutation\u201d until Theodorus reassures him that the Visitor is \nmore moderate than those who spend their time in eristic and \ncompetitive disputation (Sph. 216a\u2013b). Plato\u2019s references \nthus consistently connect Zeno with the rise of eristic disputation, \nand it is perfectly plausible that his arguments against plurality \nand motion would have been well-known examples of making the weaker \ncase seem the stronger. \n\n\nThe portrait of Zeno and his tactics that emerges from Plato\u2019s \nreferences makes it seem natural that Aristotle, in one of his lost \ndialogues, entitled Sophist, spoke of Zeno as the inventor \nof dialectic (D.L. 8.57; cf. 9.25; S.E. M. 7.7). Precisely \nwhat Aristotle meant by this remains a matter of speculation, given \nthat Aristotle also attributes the invention of dialectic to Socrates\n(Arist. Metaph. M.4, 1078b25\u201330) and to Plato \n(Metaph. A.6, 987b31\u20133); he says he himself \ninvented the theory of it (SE \n34, 183b34\u2013184b8). There is also the question of\nwhether Aristotle viewed Zeno\u2019s arguments as more eristic than \nproperly dialectical. The difference, according to Aristotle, is that\ndialectical arguments proceed from endoxa or \u201cviews \nheld by everyone or by most people or by the wise, that is, by all, \nmost, or the especially famous and respected of the wise,\u201d \nwhereas eristic arguments proceed from what only seem to be, or what \nseems to follow from, endoxa (Top. \n1.1, 100a29\u201330, b22\u20135). Aristotle clearly \nbelieves that some of Zeno\u2019s assumptions have only a specious \nplausibility (see Top. 8.8, 160b7\u20139, SE \n24, 279b17\u201321, Ph. 1.2, 233a21\u201331, \nMetaph. B.4.1001b13\u201316), so that they would\nby Aristotle\u2019s own criteria be examples of eristic rather than\nproperly dialectical arguments. For Aristotle, then, Zeno was a\ncontroversialist and paradox-monger, whose arguments were nevertheless\nboth sophisticated enough to qualify him as the inventor of dialectic\nand were important for forcing clarification of concepts fundamental\nto natural science. Aristotle\u2019s view of Zeno thus seems largely in\naccordance with Plato\u2019s portrayal of him as a master of the art of\ncontradiction. \n\n\nShould we then think of Zeno as a sophist? Certainly Isocrates, the \nrhetorician and contemporary of Plato, did not hesitate to lump \nGorgias, Zeno, and Melissus together as among the other \n\u201csophists\u201d flourishing in the era of Protagoras and all \nproducing tedious treatises advocating the most outrageous claims \n(Isoc. Hel. [Orat. 10] 2\u20133). While there are \ndifficulties in giving precise definition to the term \n\u201csophist,\u201d one feature common to those normally classed \nas such that Zeno lacks is an interest in the interrogation of \ncultural norms and values. Zeno\u2019s influence, however, on the great \nsophists who were his contemporaries and, more generally, on the \ntechniques of argumentation promulgated among the sophists seems \nundeniable. Protagoras\u2019 development of the techniques of antilogic, \nrooted in his claim that there are two opposed arguments on every \nmatter (D.L. 9.51), seems likely to have been inspired by Zeno\u2019s \nnovel forms of argumentation as well as by his advocacy of the most \ncounter-intuitive of theses. Zeno\u2019s influence is especially clear, \nmoreover, in Gorgias\u2019 treatise, \u201cOn Nature, or On What Is \nNot,\u201d both in its penchant for argumentation via antithesis and\nreductio and in its use of premises drawn straight from Zeno\nhimself (see [Arist.] MXG 979a23, b25,\nb37). It is even possible that the famous circle of \ncontemporary intellectuals the great Athenian statesman Pericles \ngathered around himself provided a major conduit for Zeno\u2019s impact on\nthe first generation of sophists. Plutarch, at any rate, records that\n\u201cPericles heard Zeno of Elea discoursing on nature in the \nmanner of Parmenides, and practicing a kind of skill in \ncross-examination and in driving one\u2019s opponent into a corner by \nmeans of contradictory argument\u201d (Plu. Per. 4.5). The \nskill Plutarch attributes to Zeno, still evident in the fragmentary \nremains of his arguments, is just the kind of skill in argument \nmanifested in a great deal of sophistic practice. Although doubts \nhave been raised about the reliability of Plutarch\u2019s report that \nZeno, like Damon and Anaxagoras, was one of the many contemporary \nintellectuals whose company was avidly pursued by Pericles, there is \nlittle that seriously tells against it. Thus George Kerferd has \nargued both that the patronage of Pericles and his keen interest in \nthe intellectual developments of his day must have been critically \nimportant to the sophistic movement and that Zeno\u2019s paradoxes were a \nprofound influence on the development of the sophistic method of \nantilogic, which he sees as \u201cperhaps the most characteristic \nfeature of the thought of the whole period\u201d (Kerferd 1981, \n18\u201323, 59ff., 85).\n\n\nThe evidence surveyed here suggests that Zeno\u2019s paradoxes were \ndesigned as provocative challenges to the common-sense view that our \nworld is populated by numerous things that move from place to place. \nHis apparent demonstrations of how the common-sense view is fraught \nwith contradiction made him an influential precursor of sophistic \nantilogic and eristic disputation. It is not surprising that someone \nlike Isocrates should have viewed Zeno as a sophist to be classed \nwith Protagoras and Gorgias. To ask whether Zeno was in fact a \nsophist, a practitioner of antilogic, an eristic controversialist, or\na proper dialectician is to some extent inappropriate, for these \ndesignations all acquired their normal meaning and range of \napplication only after Zeno\u2019s time. While he perhaps does not fit \nexactly into any of these categories, still his development of \nsophisticated methods of argumentation to produce apparent proofs of \nthe evidently false conclusions that motion is impossible and that \nthere are not in fact many things made it quite natural for Plato, \nAristotle, Isocrates, and others to refer to him under all these \nlabels. \n\n\nIt is remarkable that, while many of the responses to Zeno\u2019s \nparadoxes, and even some modern formulations of the paradoxes \nthemselves, depend on advanced mathematical techniques, Zeno\u2019s \noriginal arguments do not themselves appear to have involved any \nparticularly complicated mathematics. Several of the paradoxes \ninvolve no specifically mathematical notions at all. The Achilles is \nperhaps the best example since it employs only very ordinary notions,\nsuch as getting to where another has started from. The other extant \narguments for the most part deploy similarly prosaic notions: being \nsomewhere or being in a place, being in motion, moving past something\nelse, getting halfway there, being of some size, having parts, being \none, being like, being the same, and so on. Where Zeno seems to have \nleapt ahead of earlier thinkers is in deploying specifically \nquantitative concepts, most notably quantitative concepts of limit \n(peras) and the lack of limit (to apeiron). Earlier\nGreek thinkers had tended to speak of limitedness and unlimitedness \nin ways suggesting a qualitative rather than a quantitative notion. \nWhile one might suppose that Zeno\u2019s turn to a more strictly \nquantitative conception of limit and limitlessness could have been \ninspired by his familiarity with Pythagorean philosophers and \nmathematicians in Magna Graecia, we can in fact trace the philosophy \nof limiters and unlimiteds only back as far as Philolaus, a \nPythagorean roughly contemporary with Socrates and thus a good deal \nyounger than Zeno.\n\n\nWhatever may have spurred Zeno\u2019s development of his collection of \nparadoxes, his arguments quickly achieved a remarkable level of \nnotoriety. They had an immediate impact on Greek physical theory. \nZeno\u2019s powerful principle that any spatially extended entity must be \nlimitlessly divisible would profoundly impact the development of the \nsubtle and powerful physical theories of both Anaxagoras, who accepts\nthe principle, and the early atomists, Leucippus and Democritus, who \nreject it. Zeno\u2019s arguments also had a formative influence on \nAristotle\u2019s own theory of the continuum and of continuous motion. \nMore generally, Zeno\u2019s arguments made it necessary for Greek natural \nphilosophers to develop something more than an everyday conception of\nthe composition of material bodies. His arguments, perhaps more than \nanything else, forced the Greek natural philosophers to develop \nproperly physical theories of composition as opposed to the \nessentially chemical theories of earlier thinkers such as Empedocles.\nThat mathematicians and physicists have worked ever since to develop \nresponses to the more ingenious of his paradoxes is remarkable, \nthough perhaps not surprising, for immunity to his paradoxes might be\ntaken as a condition upon the adequacy of our most basic physical \nconcepts. He may even have offered his collection of paradoxes to \nprovoke deeper consideration of the adequacy of theretofore \nunexamined notions. If so, it is likewise remarkable that he \nsimultaneously developed forms of argument\u2014most notably, \nreductio ad absurdum by means of antinomical and/or regress \narguments\u2014that have ever since been fundamental to \nphilosophical probing of conceptual adequacy. \n",
