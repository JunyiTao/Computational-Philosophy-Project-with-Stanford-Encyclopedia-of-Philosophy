    "main_text": "Leibnizian Essentialism\n3. Leibnizian Essentialism\n\n\nLeibniz's logical conception of the nature of substance,\naccording to which each individual substance has a concept so complete\nthat it contains all predicates true of it past, present, and future\n(or from which all its predicates are deducible), also seems to push\nhim to endorse a strong version of essentialism. Just\nhow strong this essentialism is has been the subject of debate among\nscholars of Leibniz's thought.\n\n\nCall essentialism the doctrine that for any individual\nsubstance, x, there is a property P of x\nsuch that, necessarily, if x exists, then x\nhas P.  In other words, there is some property that\nis essential to x.  For example, one could argue that\nhumanity is essential to Caesar; and if Caesar (somehow) were to lose\nthe property of being a human being, Caesar would cease to be\nCaesar.\n\n\nCall superessentialism the doctrine that for any\nindividual substance, x, and for any\nproperty P of x, necessarily,\nif x exists, then x has P.  In\nother words, every property is essential\nto x.  For example, one might imagine\nthat crosser of the Rubicon or possessor of 12,147 hairs\non his head on the Ides of March, 44 B.C.E. were properties that,\nwere they different, the Caesar of our world would no longer\nexist. (For the sake of argument, assume that the head-hair count is\ntrue; it is only supposed to get at some seemingly trivial property.)\nOr, put differently, if those properties were different, the Caesars\nwould be genuinely different individual substances.\n\n\nNow, it certainly seems that Leibniz's view is that, indeed,\nevery property of an individual substance is essential to\nit.\n\n\nThis very point is something that Antoine Arnauld noticed\nimmediately upon reading the Discourse on Metaphysics.\n(More exactly, Arnauld read only what are now usually presented as\nbrief synopses of the individual sections.) As he wrote to\nLeibniz, \u201cSince it is impossible that I should not always have\nremained myself, whether I had married or lived in celibacy,\nthe individual concept of myself contained neither of these\ntwo states; just as it is well to infer: this block of marble is the\nsame whether it be at rest or be moved; therefore neither rest nor\nmotion is contained in its individual concept.\u201d (G II 30)\nArnauld's point is quite simply that the property of being\ncelibate is not essential to him or to his concept\nbecause he would still be Arnauld even if he had married and had\nchildren.\n\n\nLeibniz's response takes us into some fascinating metaphysical\nterritory. Returning to his original example of Adam and his\nsins, Leibniz writes the following:\n\n\n\nI have said that all human events can be deduced not simply by\nassuming the creation of a vague Adam, but by assuming the creation of\nan Adam determined with respect to all these circumstances, chosen from\namong an infinity of possible Adams. This has given Arnauld the\noccasion to object, not without reason, that it is as difficult to\nconceive of several Adams, taking Adam as a particular nature, as it is\nto conceive of several mes. I agree, but when speaking of several\nAdams, I was not taking Adam as a determinate individual. I must\ntherefore explain myself. This is what I meant. When one considers in\nAdam a part of his predicates, for example, that he is the first man,\nset in a garden of pleasure, from whose side God fashioned a woman, and\nsimilar things conceived sub ratione generalitatis, in a\ngeneral way (that is to say, without naming Eve, Paradise, and other\ncircumstances that fix individuality), and when one calls Adam the\nperson to whom these predicates are attributed, all this is not\nsufficient to determine the individual, for there can be an infinity of\nAdams, that is, an infinity of possible persons, different from one\nanother, whom this fits. Far from disagreeing with what Arnauld says\nagainst this multiplicity of the same individual, I myself used this to\nmake it better understood that the nature of an individual must be\ncomplete and determinate. I am even quite convinced of what Saint\nThomas had already taught about intelligences, which I hold to apply\ngenerally, namely, that it is not possible for there to be two\nindividuals entirely alike, or differing only numerically. Therefore,\nwe must not conceive of a vague Adam, that is, a person to whom certain\nattributes of Adam belong, when we are concerned with determining\nwhether all human events follow from his assumption; rather, we must\nattribute to him a notion so complete that everything that can be\nattributed to him can be deduced from it. Now, there is no room for\ndoubting that God can form such a notion of him, or rather that he\nfinds it already formed in the realm of possibles, that is, in his\nunderstanding.\n\n\n It, therefore, also follows that he would\nnot have been our Adam, but another Adam, had other events happened to\nhim, for nothing prevents us from saying that he would be another.\nTherefore, he is another. (G II 41\u201342/AG 72\u201373)\n\n\n\nLeibniz's point is that, since the Adam of the actual world (call him\n\u201cAdam@\u201d) has a complete concept containing all\nof his properties and since Adam@ (or any substance)\nexpresses the entire world of which he is a member, Adam@\ncould not exist in a different world. Moreover, if any of\nAdam@'s properties were somehow changed, then the resulting\nbeing would not be Adam@.  This is indeed an important\nconsequence of his Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles. When\nwe speak of the Adam who brought sin into the world and an Adam who\ndid not, we cannot, strictly speaking, be referring to the same\nindividual. And that failure of identical reference is the key to\nseeing that all of Adam's properties are essential to him. Leibniz\nmakes this point about as clearly as he makes any point in \u00a730 of\nthe Discourse on Metaphysics in his discussion of Judas' sin:\n\u201cBut someone else will say, why is it that this man will\nassuredly commit this sin? The reply is easy: otherwise he would not\nbe this man.\u201d (A VI iv 1576/AG 61) In other words, Leibniz seems\nto deny the possibility of \u201ctransworld-individuals\u201d and\nasserts instead that every individual is \u201cworld-bound.\u201d\nNevertheless, Leibniz argues that there are \u201cvague Adams,\u201d\nthat is, quasi-individuals which exist in more than one world. And\nwhen we imagine other possible worlds in which \u201cAdam\u201d does\nnot sin or eats the forbidden donut, we are imagining only an\nincomplete or vague \u201cAdam\u201d who is the individual in that\nworld \u2013 not the same individual. That is, the\n\u201cvague Adams\u201d are only quasi-individuals because their\nindividual concepts are not complete. Indeed, when Leibniz speaks of\nthe \u201cvague Adams,\u201d what he has in mind is some set\nproperties that is common to a number of individuals:\nAdam@, Adamw\u2032 (i.e. Adam in\nworld\u2032), Adamw\u2033,\nAdamw\u2032\u2032\u2032, and so on. In the\nterminology of David Lewis's modal theory, they are the\n\u201ccounterparts\u201d of Adam in other possible worlds. Strictly\nspeaking, however, only individuals with complete individual concepts\nare denizens of other possible worlds; quasi-individuals per se cannot\nbe said to exist. But an incomplete concept can be used to delimit a\nset of counterparts that do exist with complete individual concepts in\ndifferent possible worlds. And lest it be thought that talk of the\nidea of a \u201cvague Adam\u201d is limited to his discussion in the\n1680s with Arnauld about modal matters, it should be noted that\nLeibniz makes much the same point 20 years later in the concluding\nsections of the\nTheodicy discussed and quoted above when he writes of the\n\u201cseveral Sextuses\u201d that are to be found in the palace\ncontaining the books of fates. All of this speaks very strongly\nfor attributing the doctrine of superessentialism to Leibniz throughout\nhis life as well as the denial of the doctrine of transworld\nidentity.\n\n\nBut if we attribute the doctrine of superessentialism to Leibniz, then\nit would seem that there will be a difficulty in distinguishing those\nproperties that traditionally were thought to be essential to an\nindividual and those that were thought to be mere accidents. In\nother words, if all properties are essential, on Leibniz's view,\nis there any difference between his humanity and his\nwearing a fluffy silk shirt on 1 January 1700? Not\nsurprisingly, Leibniz has a solution to this apparent problem. In an\nimportant work on logic from the period of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics and Correspondence with Arnauld, the General\nInquiries about the Analysis of Concepts and of Truths\n(Generales Inquisitiones de Analysi Notionum et Veritatum,\n1686), Leibniz makes the standard, Aristotelian distinction between\nessential properties and accidents, saying \u201cthat thing which is\ncalled \u2018a man\u2019 cannot cease to be a man except by\nannihilation; but someone can begin or cease to be a king, or learned,\nthough he himself remains the same.\u201d (A VI iv 740/LLP 47) The\nimportant point here is the species to which an individual\nbelongs contributes one level of properties to an individual; but, of\ncourse, these are properties that are held in common by all members of\nthat particular species. Therefore, for example, Adam is not only a\nman, but necessarily also rational and, to use the Aristotelian\nchestnut, a featherless biped. Following Mondadori (1993), let us\ncall being a human being a specific essential\nproperty. But there may also be individuating essential\nproperties, those which single x out from\nthe other members of the same species and which are nevertheless such\nthat, lacking them, x would no longer be\nx. For example, consider several counterpart\nAdams: one who brought no sin into the world, one who did so by eating\nthe forbidden donut, etc. As we have said, they cannot be\nidentical to Adam@, which is another way of saying that\nAdam@ would cease to be Adam@ if he no longer\nbrought sin into the world by eating the forbidden fruit. But now\nconsider a Plantinga-inspired example: the alligator who brought sin\ninto the world. Could the alligator count as a counterpart of\nAdam@? No, for lacking the property of humanity, there are\nsimply no counterparts of Adam@. In support of this view,\nconsider On Freedom, Fate and the Grace of God (De\nlibertate, fato, gratia Dei, 1686/87), where Leibniz first has a\ncritic of his view say that, \u201cGod \u2026 has in his intellect\na notion or an idea of Peter as perfect as possible containing all\ntruths concerning Peter, the objective reality of which constitutes\nthe complete nature or essence of Peter, and accordingly, to deny is\nessential to Peter and is foreknown by God.\u201d Leibniz's response\nemploys the distinction between necessary and contingent\nproperties:\n\n\nthere is contained in this complete notion of a possible Peter,\nwhich I concede is observed by God, not only the essential or the\nnecessary, namely, that which flows from incomplete or specific\nnotions, and which are demonstrated from terms so that the contrary\nimplies a contradiction, but also the existential or contingent so to\nspeak are contained therein, because it is of the nature of an\nindividual substance that its nature be perfect and complete. (A VI iv\n1600)\n\n\nWhile the first passage seems to be Leibniz's position, he\nactually finesses this view in the second passage. Those\nproperties that are said to be necessary or essential are actually what\nwere called above the specific essential properties.\nThus, Peter's specific essential properties include being a human\nbeing and what follows from that, for example, being rational.\nThe crucial feature of these properties is that their absence\nmeans that the individual would be annihilated entirely; for example,\nif humanity were somehow stripped from Peter's complete\nindividual concept, Peter would cease to exist\ncompletely. Those properties that are said to be\ncontingent or existential are all the myriad properties that\nindividuate Peter and that make Peter the particular person that he\nis. As Leibniz says, they are what fill out Peter's\ncomplete individual concept. Now, these properties can still be\nconsidered essential in the sense relevant to Leibniz's\nsuperessentialism, but in the following way (similar to what was said\nabove about Adam@): if such a property, for example,\ndenying Christ, were stripped from Peter's complete\nindividual concept, Peter would cease to be Peter. In other\nwords, imagine Peter's notion, containing, among other things,\nhumanity, being a disciple of Christ, being the\nfounder of the church, and being a denier of\nChrist. Leibniz's point seems to be that we\ncould peer into a nearby possible world where a\nPeter-counterpart did not deny Christ. But there is no nearby\npossible world in which a Peter was the alligator or marmoset that\ndenied Christ.\n\n\nIf, however, this is Leibniz's view, then it might seem that\nwe have a problem: the specific essential properties of an individual\nare few; the individuating essential properties are many; and the\nspecific essential properties are in fact so few that they do little\nwork. Yet, it should be emphasized that, for Leibniz, there is\nsomething very important about drawing a line between human beings and\nother animals: we are rational, while they are not; we are capable of\nmorality, while they are not. This view comes out most clearly in\nLeibniz's New Essays, where he is trying to undermine\nLocke's deep anti-essentialism: \u201cas we know the inner\nessence of man, namely reason, which resides in the individual man and\nis present in all men, and as we find among us no fixed inner feature\nwhich generates a subdivision, we have no grounds for thinking that the\ntruth about their inner natures implies that there is any essential\nspecific difference among men.\u201d (A VI, vi, 325\u201326/RB\n325\u201326) In other words, there are certain properties within us\nthat necessarily differentiate us from all other species and those that\ndifferentiate us from all other individuals within that species.\nIn this regard, Leibniz is a traditionalist, upholding a real,\nessential distinction between human beings and other creatures.\nYet, insofar as he believes that all properties of an\nindividual are essential to that individual, Leibniz is radical.\n",
