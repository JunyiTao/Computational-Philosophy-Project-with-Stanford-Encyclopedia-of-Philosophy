    "main_text": "Four Arguments for the Faithfulness of Pure Wave Mechanics || Experience is found in the relative memory records of observers\n5.1 Experience is found in the relative memory records of observers\n\nEverett held that one can find our actual experience in the model of\npure wave mechanics as relative measurement records associated with\nobservers modeled as ordinary physical systems. In the state\n\\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) above, since \\(J\\) has a different relative\nmeasurement record in each branch and since these relative records\nspan the space of possible outcomes, regardless of what result is in\nfact experienced, one will be able to find that experience as a\nrelative record of the modeled observer in the post-measurement\nstate.\n\nFurther, if one performs a sequence of measurements, it follows from\nthe linearity of the dynamics and Everett\u2019s physical model of an\nobserver that every physically possible sequence of determinate\nmeasurement results will be represented in the entangled\npost-measurement state as a relative sequence of determinate\nmeasurement records. This is also true if one only relatively, rather\nthan absolutely, makes a sequence of observations. In this precise\nsense, then, it is possible to find our experience as sequences of\nrelative records in the model of pure wave mechanics.\n\nEverett took such relative records to be sufficient to explain the\nsubjective appearances of observers because, at least for an ideal\nmeasurement, every post-measurement relative state will be one where\nthe observer in fact has, and, as we will see in the next section,\nwould report that she has, a fully determinate, repeatable measurement\nrecord that agrees with the records of other ideal observers. As he\nexplained the point, the system states observed by a relative observer\nare typically eigenstates of the observable being measured (1957,\n188). For further discussion of this point see Everett (1956,\n129\u201330), (1955, 67), (1956 121\u20133 and 130\u20133), and\n(1957, 186\u20138 and 194\u20135).\n\nNote that he did not require a physically preferred basis to show that\npure wave mechanics was empirically faithful. The principle of the\nfundamental relatively of states explicitly allows for arbitrarily\nspecified decompositions of the absolute universal state into relative\nstates. Given his understanding of empirical faithfulness, all he\nneeded to explain a particular actual record was to show that is that\nthere is some decomposition of the state that represents the\nmodeled observer with the corresponding relative record. It is there\nthat he finds the records corresponding to an observer\u2019s\nexperience in his model.\n",
