    "main_text": "The Nature of Players || Preference Logics for Games\n3.2 Preference Logics for Games\n\nFor reasoning about preferences, it must first be specified what it is\nthat agents\u2019 preferences apply to. The orthodox account lets\npreferences exclusively range over possible outcomes (Osborne\n& Rubinstein 1994). However, a\ngrowing trend in the logical literature assumes agents to rather care\nabout the truth value of general propositions than can describe both\nthe progression or outcome of a game. While not equivalent, the two\nperspectives are compatible. Both will be discussed in this\nsection.\n\nIn the classical picture, player i\u2019s preferences on a\ngame tree are represented by a preference relation \\(\\prec_i\\) ranging\nover the set of outcomes. Such a relation is usually assumed\ntransitive and reflexive, but need not be total.\n\nExample A game tree with preferences.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nJust as with the earlier modal logics for game forms, a relatively\nsimple logical formalism can already express relevant aspects of\nagency in games. It offers a low-complexity language for stating basic\nfeatures of action and information, without going into details of the\nunderlying quantitative mechanisms. More precisely, games with\npreferences naturally support a logic with modal operators\n\\([\\preceq_i]\\) interpreted as:\n\n\\([\\preceq_i]\\varphi\\)\n\\(\\varphi\\) holds in all states at least as good as the current\none to agent i.\n\n\nLogics of this type can express various properties relevant to games.\nThey can, for instance, say that all states better than the current\none are \\(\\varphi\\) states, making moving towards \\(\\varphi\\) states a\nnecessary condition for maximizing utility. They can also express,\nthat all best states are \\(\\varphi\\) states, with the formula \n\n\\[\\langle\\preceq_i\\rangle[\\preceq_i]\\varphi\\]\n\n\nFor more on modal preference logics, see \nHansson (1990, 2001),Girard\n(2008) and van der Torre\n(1997).\n\nModal preference logic has further extensions with natural connections\nto games. In a refined perspective, for instance, preferences may\nderive from reasons, say, criteria or goals various agents want to\nachieve. This gives rise to a duality between preference relations\namong outcome states and priority orders over formulas, describing the\nagents\u2019 goals. Dynamic accounts, finally, track how preference\ncan change under various input events. For more on both of these\nissues, see Liu (2011).\n\nHowever, modal preference logics, construed either way, are not yet\nrich enough to express one of the essential notions of game theory.\nFurther extensions are needed to deal with best responses,\nexpressing that the current move of a player is the best she can do in\nlight of her opponent\u2019s actions.\n\nBest response moves are the main ingredient for game equilibria.\nFormally, a Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile, fixing a\nunique choice for each player, where nobody can improve by\nunilaterally changing strategy when all others maintain theirs. There\nare several ways of defining this property in extended modal\npreference languages. One possibility is to simply introduce a new\natom \\(b_i\\), stating that the current world is the best player\ni could have achieved in light of the opponents\u2019 actions.\nIn this language, Nash equilibrium are characterized by \n\n\\[\\bigwedge_{i\\in \\text{Players}}b_i.\\]\n\n\nMore explicit definitions exist, building on the strict preference\nmodalities of van Benthem, Girard, and Roy\n(2009). Yet, perhaps the simplest illuminating approach uses an\nintersection modality from hybrid logic (Areces\nand ten Cate 2007) combining the\nagent\u2019s preference relation with her uncertainty between the\nopponent\u2019s action to characterize best responses and Nash\nequilibria (cf.\n Section 2.6):\n \n\\[\\bigwedge_{i\\in \\text{Players}}[\\prec_i\\cap\\equiv_i]\\bot\\]\n\n\nExpressing Nash equilibrium has served as a benchmark for logics of\nstrategic games (van der Hoek & Pauly\n2007). Yet there are other desiderata, often connected to\nanalyzing standard game-theoretic solution concepts for games. These\nare usually designed to find Nash equilibria or at least narrow down\nthe strategy profiles to those compatible with certain requirements of\nrationality. Well-known methods of this kind are Backward Induction\nfor extensive games and Iterated Removal of Strictly Dominated\nStrategies for strategic form games (Osborne\n& Rubinstein 1994). These will be discussed now, as they\nraise intriguing further logical issues.\n\n",
