    "main_text": "What is Relativism? || The hidden parameter definition\n1.3 The hidden parameter definition\nWhat also binds various forms of relativism is an underlying idea that claims to truth, knowledge or justification have an implicit, maybe even unnoticed, relationship to a parameter or domain. Gilbert Harman (1975), Robert Nozick (2001), and Crispin Wright (2008b) are among the philosophers to propose versions of this thesis. Paul Boghossian summarizes the position this way:\n\nthe relativist about a given domain, D, purports to have discovered that the truths of D involve an unexpected relation to a parameter. (Boghossian 2006b: 13)\n\nTo take an example, moral relativism, according to this approach, is the claim that the truth or justification of beliefs with moral content is relative to specific moral codes. So the sentence \u201cIt is wrong to sell people as slaves\u201d is elliptical for \u201cIt is wrong to sell people as slaves relative to the moral code of \u2026\u201d. Or alternatively, as Kusch (2010) formulates the idea on behalf of the relativist: \u201cIt is wrong-relative-to-the-moral-code-of-\u2026\u201d to sell people as slaves. The resulting sentence(s) turns out to be true, according to the relativist, depending on how we fill in the \u201c\u2026\u201d. So, \u201cIt is wrong to sell people as slaves\u201d comes out true relative to the moral code of the United Nations Charter of Human Rights and false relative to the moral code of ancient Greece. The justifying thought is that judgments about the morality of slavery, or any other ethical issue, are based on differing conventions, and there is no universal or objective criterion for choosing among differing competing socio-historically constituted conventions. Moreover, as a corollary of this approach, there is no truth of the matter of whether it is wrong to sell people as slaves, independently of the specification of some standard. Thus on the hidden parameter account, a consequence is that the relevant claims will be true, if at all, only relative to some parameter.\nThis particular approach to relativism is often expressed in explicitly linguistic terms and is favored by philosophers interested in the semantic dimensions of relativism. The claim is that predicates such as \u201cis true\u201d, \u201cis rational\u201d, \u201cis right\u201d, \u201cis good\u201d etc. in a natural language have the apparent logical form of one-place predicates, but their surface grammatical form is misleading, because upon further investigation they prove to be elliptical for two-place predicates such as \u201cis true relative to\u2026\u201d, \u201cis right according to\u201d, etc., (of course, where such predicates are available). Relativism, according to this approach, is the claim that a statement of the form \u201cA is P\u201d within a given domain (e.g., science, ethics, metaphysics, etc.) is elliptical for the statement \u201cA is P in relation to C\u201d, where A stands for an assertion, belief, judgment or action, P stands for a predicate such as \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cbeautiful\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201crational\u201d, \u201clogical\u201d, \u201cknown\u201d etc., and C stands for a specific culture, epistemic framework, language, belief-system, etc.\nThe three approaches outlined here are compatible and sometimes complementary. A relativistic thesis as captured by the approach outlined in \u00a71.1 for instance, will also be relativistic in at least one of the negative senses outlined in \u00a71.2. Moreover, as we shall see, since various subdivisions of relativism appearing in table 1 could, with appropriate modification, be expressed as claims about the truth of sentences falling in a particular domain, then the hidden predicate approach is applicable to them as well. (See \u00a75 for a more detailed way to give expression to the hidden parameter insight within recent work in the philosophy of language.)\n",
