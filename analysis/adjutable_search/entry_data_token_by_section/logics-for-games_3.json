    "main_text": "Overview || Computation and Agency\n1.3 Computation and Agency\n\nPhilosophical logic and mathematical logic are not the only\nilluminating perspectives on games. A third relevant viewpoint is that\nof computational logic. In modern computation, the paradigm is no\nlonger single Turing machines but interacting systems of multiple\nprocessors. These processors may cooperate, but they might also\ncompete for resources. In general, hence, it is useful to study\nmultiple agents engaging in computation, be it within human,\nartificial or mixed societies. Though doing so, games become a natural\nmodel for computation, too. In fact, games are rich multi-agent\nsystems where agents process information, communicate, and engage in\nactions, all driven by their respective preferences and goals. In the\nconverse direction, computer science themes such as complexity and\nalgorithmics have entered game theory, resulting in the area of \ncomputational game theory (Nisan et al.\n2007). For a richer survey of computational logics of agency\nand games, see van der Hoek and Pauly\n(2007) and Shoham and Leyton-Brown\n(2008). The present entry contains occasional links to\ncomputation. These are especially prominent for reasoning about\ntemporally extended games and their strategies (Sections\n 4.2,\n 4.4) and in the context of gamification\n (Section 6),\n where games are explored as a novel semantics for classical logical\nsystems.\n",
