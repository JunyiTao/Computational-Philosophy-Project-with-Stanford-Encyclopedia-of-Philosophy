    "main_text": "\n\nPrayer seems to be a prominent feature of every religion. When people\npray, they attempt to contact/communicate with special persons or\nentities, such as a God or gods, or dead relatives, or exemplary human\nbeings who are believed to occupy some special status.\n\nPeople pray for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes people pray in order\nto give thanks, sometimes to offer praise and adoration, sometimes to\napologize and seek forgiveness, and sometimes to ask for things. The\nfocus of this article is petitionary prayer, in which a petitioner\nrequests something. Historically, the philosophical puzzles\nconcerning petitionary prayer that have received most attention have\narisen in connection with the traditional monotheism shared by\nJudaism, Christianity, and Islam. According to traditional monotheism,\nGod knows everything that can be known, is perfectly good, impassible\n(unable to be affected by an outside source), immutable (unchanging),\nand free. God is also able to do anything compatible with the\npossession of the qualities just enumerated. In this entry, we will\nexplore the most prominent philosophical puzzles that arise in\nconnection with the idea of offering petitionary prayers to God, as\nunderstood along the lines just described, along with the most\ninfluential attempts to solve them.\n",
