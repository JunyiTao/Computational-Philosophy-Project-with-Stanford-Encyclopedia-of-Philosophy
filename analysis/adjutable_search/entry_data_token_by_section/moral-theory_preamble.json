Some of that disagreement centers on the issue of\ndemarcating the moral from other areas of practical\nnormativity, such as the ethical and the aesthetic. Some\ndisagreement centers on the issue of what a moral\ntheory\u2019s aims and functions are. In this entry,\nboth questions will be addressed. However, this entry is about moral\ntheories as theories, and is not a survey of specific\ntheories, though specific theories will be used as examples.\n",
