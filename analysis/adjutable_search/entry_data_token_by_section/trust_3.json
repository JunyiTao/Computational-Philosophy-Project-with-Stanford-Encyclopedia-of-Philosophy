    "main_text": "The Nature of Trust and Trustworthiness || Distrust\n1.3 Distrust\n\nAs suggested above, distrust has been somewhat of an afterthought for\nphilosophers (Hawley\n 2014),[9]\n although their attention to it has grown recently. As with trust and\ntrustworthiness, philosophers would agree that distrust has certain\nfeatures, although the few who have developed theories of distrust\ndisagree ultimately about the nature of it.\n\nThe following are features of distrust that are relatively\nuncontroversial (see D\u2019Cruz 2020):\n\nDistrust is not just the absence of trust since it is possible to\nneither distrust nor trust someone (Hawley 2014: 3; Jones 1996: 16;\nKrishnamurthy 2015). There is gap between the two\u2014\u201cthe\npossibility of being suspended between\u201d them (Ullmann-Margalit\n2004 [2017: 184]). (For disagreement, see Faulkner 2017.)\nAlthough trust and distrust are not exhaustive, they are\nexclusive; one cannot at the same time trust and distrust someone\nabout the same matter (Ullmann-Margalit 2004 [2017: 201]).\nDistrust is \u201cnot mere nonreliance\u201d (Hawley 2014: 3). I\ncould choose not to rely on a colleague\u2019s assistance because I\nknow she is terribly busy, not because I distrust her.\nRelatedly, distrust has a normative dimension. If I distrusted a\ncolleague for no good reason and they found out about it, then they\nwould probably be hurt or angry. But the same reaction would not\naccompany them knowing that I decided not to rely on them (Hawley\n2014). Being distrusted is a bad thing (Domenicucci and Holton 2017:\n150; D\u2019Cruz 2019: 935), while not being relied on needn\u2019t\nbe bad at all.\nDistrust is normally a kind of nonreliance, just as trust is a\nkind (or many kinds) of reliance. Distrust involves\n\u201caction-tendencies\u201d of avoidance or withdrawal\n(D\u2019Cruz 2019: 935\u2013937), which make it incompatible with\nreliance\u2014or at least complete reliance. We can be forced to rely\non people we distrust, yet even then, we try to keep them at as safe a\ndistance as possible.\n\n\nGiven the relationship between trust and distrust and the similarities\nbetween them (e.g., one is \u201cricher than [mere] reliance\u201d\nand the other is \u201cricher than mere nonreliance\u201d; Hawley\n2014: 3), one would think that any theory of trust should be able to\nexplain distrust and vice versa. Hawley makes this point and\ncriticizes theories of trust for not being able to make sense of\ndistrust (2014: 6\u20139). For example, will-based accounts imply\nthat distrust must be nonreliance plus an expectation of ill will, yet\nthe latter is not required for distrust. I could distrust someone\nbecause he is careless, not because he harbors ill will toward me\n(Hawley 2014: 6).\n\nHawley defends her commitment account of trust, in part, because she\nbelieves it is immune to the above criticism. It says that distrust is\nnonreliance plus the belief that the person distrusted is committed to\ndoing what we will not rely on them to do. In spite of them being\ncommitted in this way (or so we believe), we do not rely on them\n(2014: 10). This account does not require that we impute any\nparticular motive or feeling to the one distrusted, like ill will. At\nthe same time, it tells us why distrust is not mere nonreliance and\nalso why it is normative; the suspicion of the one distrusted is that\nthey will fail to meet a commitment they have, which is bad.\n\nSome have argued that Hawley\u2019s theory of distrust is subject to\ncounterexamples, however (D\u2019Cruz 2020; Tallant 2017). For\nexample, Jason D\u2019Cruz describes a financier who \u201cbuys\ninsurance on credit defaults, positioning himself to profit when\nborrowers default\u201d (2020: 45). The financier believes that the\nborrowers have a commitment not to default, and he does not rely on\nthem to meet this commitment. The conclusion that Hawley\u2019s\ntheory would have us reach is that he distrusts the borrowers, which\ndoesn\u2019t seem right.\n\nA different kind of theory of distrust can be found in the work of\nMeena Krishnamurthy (2015), who is interested specifically in the\nvalue that distrust has for political democracies, and for political\nminorities in particular (2015). She offers what she calls a\n\u201cnarrow normative\u201d account of distrust that she derives\nfrom the political writings of Martin Luther King Jr. The account is\nnarrow because it serves a specific purpose: of explaining how\ndistrust can motivate people to resist tyranny. It is normative\nbecause it concerns what they ought to do (again, resist; 392). The\ntheory states that distrust is the confident belief that others will\nnot act justly. It needn\u2019t involve an expectation of ill will;\nKing\u2019s own distrust of white moderates was not grounded in such\nan expectation (Krishnamurthy 2015: 394). To be distrusting, one\nsimply has to believe that others will not act justly, whether out of\nfear, ignorance, or what have you.\n\nD\u2019Cruz complains that Krishnamurthy\u2019s theory is too narrow\nbecause it requires a belief that the one distrusted will fail to\ndo something (i.e., act justly) (2020); but one can be\ndistrustful of someone\u2014say a salesperson who comes to your door\n(Jones 1996)\u2014without predicting that they will do anything wrong\nor threatening. D\u2019Cruz does not explain, however, why\nKrishnamurthy needs to account for cases like these in her theory,\nwhich again is meant to serve a specific purpose. Is it important that\ndistrust can take a form other than \u201cX distrusts\nY to [do] \u03a6\u201d for it to motivate political\nresistance (D\u2019Cruz 2020: 45)? D\u2019Cruz\u2019s objection is\nsound only if the answer is \u201cyes\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, D\u2019Cruz\u2019s work is helpful in showing what a\ndescriptive account of distrust should look like\u2014that is, an\naccount that unlike Krishnamurthy\u2019s, tracks how we use the\nconcept in many different circumstances. He himself endorses a\nnormative-expectation theory, according to which distrust involves\n\n\na tendency to withdraw from reliance or vulnerability in contexts of\nnormative expectation, based on a construal of a person or persons as\nmalevolent, incompetent, or lacking integrity. (2019: 936)\n\n\nD\u2019Cruz has yet to develop this theory fully, but once he does\nso, it will almost certainly be a welcome addition to the scant\nliterature in philosophy on distrust.\n\nIn summary, among the relatively few philosophers who have written on\ndistrust, there is settled agreement about some of its features but\nnot about the nature of distrust in general. The agreed-upon features\ntell us something about when distrust is warranted (i.e., plausible).\nFor distrust in someone to be plausible, one cannot also trust that\nperson, and normally one will not be reliant on them either. Something\nelse must be true as well, however. For example, one must believe that\nthis person is committed to acting in a certain way but will not\nfollow through on this commitment. The \u201csomething else\u201d is\ncrucial because distrust is not the negation of trust and neither is\nit mere nonreliance.\n\nPhilosophers have said comparatively little about what distrust is,\nbut a lot about how distrust tends to be influenced by negative social\nstereotypes that portray whole groups of people as untrustworthy\n(e.g., Potter 2020; Scheman 2020; D\u2019Cruz 2019; M. Fricker 2007).\nTrusting attitudes are similar\u2014who we trust can depend\nsignificantly on social stereotypes, positive ones\u2014yet there is\nless discussion about this fact in the literature on trust. This issue\nconcerns the rationality (more precisely, the irrationality)\nof trust and distrust, which makes it relevant to the next section,\nwhich is on the epistemology of trust.\n",
