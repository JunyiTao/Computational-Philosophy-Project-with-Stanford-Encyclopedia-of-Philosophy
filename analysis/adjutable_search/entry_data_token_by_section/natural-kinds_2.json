    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Natural Kinds || Natural Kind Realism\n1.2 Natural Kind Realism\n\nRealism about natural kinds is the view that there exist\nentities that are the natural kinds. While naturalism about natural\nkind classifications is a matter of there being natural groupings and\ndistinctions among things and as such has no ontological commitment,\nrealism is an ontologically committed view. Since \u2018(weak)\nrealism\u2019 is sometimes used to denote naturalism, we may\ndistinguish by using the term strong realism for the\nstronger, ontological, claim that the natural divisions between kinds\nreflect the boundaries between real entities; i.e. the\ndifference between silver and gold is not just a difference between\ntwo natural groups of thing, but is a difference between two distinct\nentities silver and gold.\n\nThe traditional realism versus nominalism debate is an ontological\ndebate over whether in order to account for properties we need to\ninvoke a class of entity, universals. There is an analogous debate as\nregards natural kinds, whether in order to account for our natural\nkind talk and our natural classifications, we need a special sort of\nentity in our ontology. The natural kind nominalist may accept that\nthere are genuinely natural classifications, but will reject the idea\nthat we should invoke any object as a consequence. For example, the\nnominalist might take the world to be made up of individuals, which\ncan be classified as kinds in a natural way. But, the nominalist\nclaims, there is no kind of entity beyond the individual instances of\neach kind. The (strong) realist maintains that we cannot explain the\ndistinction between natural and non-natural classifications without\nappealing to certain entities, the natural kinds. The naturalism\nversus conventionalism debate discussed in the preceding section asked\nwhether there is a genuine metaphysical difference between natural\nclassifications and non-natural classifications; it is not obvious\nthat the naturalist, who maintains that there is a metaphysical\ndifference, is obliged to understand that difference in terms of an\nontological category of entities that are natural kinds. The analogue\nin the debate over properties is whether there is a metaphysical\ndistinction between natural properties and non-natural properties,\nbetween, in David Lewis\u2019s terminology, sparse and abundant\nproperties (Lewis, 1986). There is no immediate contradiction in the\nposition of a nominalist who rejects universals, but who maintains\nthat there is a metaphysical difference between natural properties and\nother properties. The realist in both cases argues that, ultimately,\nnaturalism (about properties and about classification) requires a\ncommitment to entities (universals and natural kinds\nrespectively).\n1.2.1 Quine on Natural Kinds and Induction\n\nQuine is an example of a philosopher who accepts, to some extent,\nnatural classifications into kinds. He holds (1969) that kinds are\nsets, so he does think that there are entities that are kinds, and to\nthat extent he is a realist. That said, his realism is minimal, since\nsets are ubiquitous entities. Any coherent classificatory principle\nwill determine a set of things thus classified, whether natural or\nartificial. Thus the ontology of natural kinds does not of itself\nexplain there being natural kinds. Quine regards the notions\nof  kind and similarity as \u201csubstantially one\nnotion\u201d (1969, 119) but denies that it is straightforward to\ngive a definition of one in terms of the other. He does consider\ndefining relative similarity thus: a is more similar to\nb than to c iff a and b share more\nproperties than a and c do. But this will work only\nif properties are less abundant than sets are (since any two things\nare jointly members of any number of sets). And Quine regards such a\nnotion of property as no clearer than the notion of kind.\n\nQuine opens his discussion of natural kinds by asking \u201cwhat\ntends to confirm an induction?\u201d (see Criterion 2 above) (1969,\n114). With Goodman\u2019s new riddle of induction and Hempel\u2019s\nparadox of confirmation in mind, Quine answers that it is the\nsimilarity or sameness of kinds between instances that permits an\ninduction: two green emeralds are more similar than two grue emeralds\nwhen one of them is green and the other blue. It is the \u201cdubious\nscientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of\nkind\u201d (1969, 116) that prompts the discussion alluded to above.\nAn intuitive notion of similarity is used in our ordinary inductions.\nAnd the force of Darwinian processes gives us some reason to think\nthat we have evolved an innate similarity space that corresponds to\nsome natural similarities. At the same time, natural science, which\ndeveloped from these primitive inductions, supported by similarities,\nis able to reveal deeper similarities that may contradict superficial\nsimilarities. For example, we have strong sense that things of the\nsame colour are objectively alike, but science tells us that there is\nno deep similarity among like-coloured things. Quine thinks that in\ndue course science will obviate the need for a general notion of\nsimilarity or kind: in each area of science more specific notions will\ntake the place of the generic notion; this is a sign of the maturity\nof a branch of science. For example, in zoology we may replace talk of\nthe similarity between two animals by discussion of the historical\nproximity of their closest common ancestor.\n\nQuine\u2019s conception of natural kinds is liberal. Not all sets are\nnatural kinds, but any set whose members share a natural property are\na natural kind. So the set of white objects is at least a candidate\nnatural kind and Quine asserts that positively charged objects form a\nnatural kind. One might wonder whether an up quark, an uranium\nnucleus, a hydronium ion, a charged water droplet, and a balloon that\nhas been rubbed on someone\u2019s jumper all belong to one kind. The\nliterature on natural kinds (cf. Mill 1884) has tended to adopt a more\nrestricted conception of kinds, although articulating that conception\nis not straightforward. This question is related to the link that\nQuine draws between kinds and what it is that confirms induction. If\none adopts the narrower conception of kinds, then one will hold that a\nlaw such as \u2018positively charged objects repel one another\u2019\ndoes not concern kinds at all, but nonetheless may be confirmed by\ninstances of objects that are positively charged repelling one\nanother. So the real answer to \u201cwhat tends to confirm an\ninduction?\u201d is not \u201cnatural kinds and their\ninstances\u201d but is \u201cnatural properties and their\ninstances\u201d. A further reason for taking this view is that\ninductions often concern relations (such as the repulsion between two\nobjects). But we do not suppose that objects that enter into a natural\nrelation form a natural kind, nor that there is a natural kind of\nordered sequences of objects satisfying a given natural relation.\n1.2.2 Cluster Kind Realism\n\nFollowing Quine, some realists have expanded upon his intuition that a\nnatural kind\u2019s members share a natural property by counting\nfamilies of such properties that are contingently clustered in nature\n(Boyd 1991, 1999a; Millikan 1999). These families of properties\ncluster together over time either because the presence of some\nproperties in the family favours the presence of others or because\nthere are underlying internal mechanisms and/or extrinsic contextual\nmechanisms which tend to secure the co-occurrence of the properties. A\nnatural kind is any such family of co-occurring properties that may be\nemployed in inductive inferences or for the purposes of scientific\nexplanation. Cluster kind realists will readily concede that,\ndepending on the case, environmental pressures may affect and alter\nthe set of properties associated with a kind over time. Therefore, in\nsuch cases, none of the properties themselves need be individually\nnecessary for kind membership.\n\nRichard Boyd (1999) considers biological species to be paradigmatic\nnatural kind clusters, where the clustering is due to a\nhomeostatic mechanism. Homeostatic property clusters (HPCs)\noccur when mechanisms exist that cause the properties to cluster by\nensuring that deviations from the cluster have a low chance of\npersisting; the presence of some of the properties in the cluster\nfavours the presence of the others. A homeostatic mechanism thereby\nachieves self-regulation, maintaining a stable range of properties. In\nthe case of species, the homeostatic mechanisms may be intrinsic (e.g.\ngene exchange within a population or developmental factors) or\nextrinsic (e.g. a species\u2019s evolutionary niche provides common\nselective factors). Since individuals inherit their basic\ncharacteristics from their parents, and very few people are taller\nthan 2.5m, we can expect the next generation to contain few people of\nthat height. Height can, however, be affected by environmental\nfactors; a mutation can cause offpring to have genes different from\ntheir parents that might cause greater than usual height, and\nmalfunctioning of the pituitary gland can cause an excess of growth\nhormone. So there can be individual cases of excessive height. But\nthey will remain rare because such gigantism and acromegaly are\naccompanied by serious complicating disorders and often result in\npremature death. Consequently, these individuals are less likely to\nreproduce than others. Even greater extremes of height (e.g. 4m) are\njust not possible, since the same developmental factors would prevent\nthe individual from being viable at an earlier stage in life.\n\nColouration across a species is often uniform when it is a camouflage\nagainst predation. The more specific the ecological niche occupied,\nthe more uniform will colouration and other features be. Deviations\nwill lead to decreased fitness and will be selected against. Obligate\nmutualistic symbiosis often provides very specialized ecological\nniches; consequently certain key properties must be present in order\nfor an individual to survive. Certain beard worms, such as Riftia\npachyptila, live at ocean floor thermal vents and have no\ndigestive tract; instead they supply hydrogen sulphide and methane to\nbacteria in their trophosomes, which oxidise the hydrogen sulphide and\nmethane on behalf of the worm. As a result the worm cannot lack any\nproperty essential for the survival of the bacteria to which it is\nhost. Such homeostatic mechanisms do not preclude deviations from the\nstandard combinations of properties\u2014mutations do occur.\nHomeostasis just means that usually such mutations will not persist.\nThe rare benevolent, or even merely neutral, mutations may persist and\nflourish, in which case there will be variation and change.\nEnvironments may change, perhaps locally, also leading to variation\nand change (e.g. the famous peppered moth). Consequently, it will not\nalways be the case that property P in a homeostatic property cluster F\nis a necessary condition of an individual belonging to the relevant\nkind.\n\nOne potential problem with the HPC view account is that homeostatic\nmechanisms are not clearly delineated in the account. In other words,\nthe role of mechanisms in maintaining the stability of property\ncluster is not addressed in Boyd\u2019s original account. Craver\n(2009) is skeptical about our attempts to give a fully realist account\nof the homeostatic property clusters because conventional elements are\ninvolved in deciding when two mechanisms are of the same kind and also\nin identifying when one mechanism ends and the other begins. Tobin\n(2017) argues that there is an overlapping problem for mechanisms\nwhich is similar the overlapping problem often discussed in the\nnatural kinds literature.\n\nSlater (2015) claims that the HPC view can be made clearer by focusing\non the special sort of stability a cluster of properties might makes\nit successful for inductive and explanatory purposes, in favour of an\nappeal to mechanisms. Slater calls this view the Stable Property\nCluster account of natural kinds.\n\nIn such cases, the boundaries of the natural kind are vague. Cluster\nkinds nevertheless do form a kind (Criterion 4 above). Members will\nhave at least some properties in common (Criterion 1). Since the\nemergence of cluster kinds is not entirely random and a\ncausal-historical account can be provided in virtue of stable\nhomeostatic mechanisms, cluster kinds are sufficiently robust to\nsupport induction (Criterion 2) and perhaps even laws of nature in\nsome cases (Criterion 3). Conversely, because the boundaries between\nnatural kinds are vague, a cluster kind realist will reject the claim\nthat natural kinds are categorically distinct (Criterion 6). She may\nbe neutral on whether they always form hierarchies (Criterion 5). That\nsaid, not all clusters need exhibit the flexibility and vagueness of\nthese biological, homeostatic cases. In other cases the clustering may\nbe directly due to the laws of nature. Thus the laws of physics rule\nout fractional nuclear charge, with the consequence that the chemical\nelements are kinds that have clearly defined boundaries and nuclear\ncharge is a necessary and sufficient condition of kind membership.\n\nChakravarrty (forthcoming) argues that natural kind realism has run\nits course and that attempts to be more liberal about multifarious\nnatural kinds have meant that more recent natural kind realist\naccounts dissolve into conventionalism. Alternatively, many more\nrecent realist account of natural kinds attempt to cling on to natural\nkind realism by buttressing it to other forms of realism. For example,\ntheorist have identified what is (mind-independently) real with other\nthings (property clusters, correlations, mechanisms, structures and so\non). According to Chakravarrty this is to conflate sui\ngeneris natural kind realism with other kinds of realism (e.g.\nrealism about property clusters or realism about mechanisms).\n1.2.3 Fundamentalism and Reductionism\n\nAs mentioned above (introduction to Section 1.2), natural kind realism\nmay be understood as an analogue of realism about universals. A\nfurther question is whether these are simply analogues or in fact\nrelated positions. Perhaps natural kinds just are (a species of)\nuniversals or are reducible to universals. Within realism, that\nreductionist view can be contrasted with natural kind\nfundamentalism, which holds that not only are there natural\nkinds (as entities), but also that natural kinds find a basic and\nsui generis place in our ontology. We illustrate three\npositions within naturalism about natural kinds: (i) naturalism\nwithout (strong) realism; reductionist realism; fundamentalist\nrealism.\n\nAccording to David Armstrong (1997, 67\u20138) \u201cThe kinds mark\ntrue joints in nature. But it is not clear that we require an\nindependent and irreducible category of universal to accommodate the\nkinds\u201d. Armstrong\u2019s view is naturalistic, since there are\ngenuine natural divisions; but he is also resistant to realism. If\nthere were natural kinds they would be universals. But the properties\nshared by all and only the members of a kind will typically be very\ncomplex. For example, he considers whether there is some description\nof human DNA. There may be, but it would be too complex to qualify as\na genuine universal. And there is no reason to suppose that this\ncomplex universal would do any causal or nomic work. So there is not\nsimply an identity between natural kinds and a subcategory of\nuniversals, the natural kind universals (e.g., the universal of\nbeing gold, or of being a human)\u2014according to\nArmstrong\u2019s argument there are no natural kind universals. He\ndoes concede that the case is stronger for basic kind universals, such\nas electronhood, where a few properties (the electron\u2019s mass,\ncharge, and spin) are individually necessary and jointly sufficient\nfor kind membership.\n\nHawley and Bird (2011) argue that natural kinds are complex\nuniversals. A complex universal is a universal whose parts are\nuniversals (just as a complex particular is a particular whose parts\nare particulars). In the case of the electron the fundamental\nuniversals (the electron\u2019s mass, charge, and spin) do combine to\nform a complex universal. Since an universal is wholly\nlocated where the universal is located, every entity that instantiates\nelectronhood also instantiates its component universals, the\nelectron\u2019s mass, charge, and spin. Not every collection of\nuniversals constitutes a natural kind, just as not every collection of\nparticulars constitutes a natural (complex) particular. The facts that\nexplain the clustering of properties explain why these universals\ncompose a complex one. Not every complex universal is, like\nelectronhood, precise. Some are vague, and this fact can accommodate\nthe indeterminacy of kind constitution implied by Boyd\u2019s view of\nthe clusters in the case of biological kinds.\n\nLike Hawley and Bird, E. J. Lowe takes natural kinds to be entities\n(1998, 2006a, 2006b). Thus Lowe is a natural kind realist.\nFurthermore, he takes natural kinds\u2014substantial\nuniversals in his terminology\u2014to constitute an irreducible\nontological category (one category in his four-category ontology).\nHence he is a natural kind fundamentalist. Lowe argues that\nrecognizing the ontologically fundamental distinction between\nsubstantial universals (natural kinds) and non-substantial universals\n(properties) accounts for the laws of nature in a manner that, while\navoiding the problems of a regularity account, may nonetheless do\nwithout Armstrong\u2019s second order relation of necessitation,\nitself a relational universal (Armstrong 1983, 75\u2013110). Consider\nthe law that planets travel in ellipses. According to Lowe\u2019s\naccount, this should be understood as a matter of the kind\nplanet being characterized by the property travels in an\nellipse. (One might query whether all laws can be given this form\nand so whether the fact that some general truth is a law should be\nexplained this way. For what makes planets travel in ellipses is the\nfact that they have mass and hence little to do with their being\nplanets. For example, Kepler\u2019s law is an application of\nNewton\u2019s laws, but the latter concerns quantities (mass,\ndistance), which should be understood as universals not kinds.)\n\nAs in Lowe\u2019s ontology, natural kinds play a fundamental role in\nthe ontology of Brian Ellis (2001, 2002). For Ellis the term\n\u2018natural kind\u2019 covers three hierarchical categories:\nnatural kinds of objects (substantive kinds), natural kinds of\nprocesses and events (dynamic kinds), and natural kinds of properties\nand relations (property kinds). The chemical elements and compounds\nare substantive kinds; the different chemical reactions are dynamic\nkinds; a tetrahedral molecular structure is a (structural) property\nkind (whose species include the particular tetrahedral structures of\nmethane, carbon tetrachloride, silicon tetrafluoride and so forth).\nEllis is uncommitted on whether the dynamic kinds are independent of\nthe other two types of kinds; but these are independent of one\nanother. Each kind is a universal, and the three categories of kind\ntherefore form three categories of universal. Thus the substantive\nkinds\u2014the familiar kinds of thing and stuff\u2014are\nuniversals, but these are not reducible to property universals. Ellis\nnotes that laws of nature have a hierarchical structure:\nKepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion are an application of\nNewton\u2019s laws. He argues (2001, 90) that the only satisfactory\naccount of this is fact that natural kinds also exist in hierarchies\n(see Criterion 5).\n",
