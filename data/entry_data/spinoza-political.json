    "preamble": "\n\n\nAt least in anglophone countries, Spinoza\u2019s reputation as a\npolitical thinker is eclipsed by his reputation as a rationalist\nmetaphysician. Nevertheless, Spinoza was a penetrating political\ntheorist whose writings have enduring significance. In his two\npolitical treatises, Spinoza advances a number of forceful and original\narguments in defense of democratic governance, freedom of thought and\nexpression, and the subordination of religion to the state. On the\nbasis of his naturalistic metaphysics, Spinoza also offers trenchant\ncriticisms of ordinary conceptions of right and duty. And his account\nof civil organization stands as an important contribution to the development of constitutionalism and the rule of law.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Historical Background\n\n\nIn order to situate Spinoza\u2019s political writings, I will\nprovide a brief overview of the theologico-political context of the\nUnited Provinces, followed by a sketch of intellectual background to\nthese works.\n1.1 Theological and Political Background\n\n\nDespite being perhaps the most tolerant country in early-modern\nEurope\u2014a sanctuary for free thinkers and members of religious\nminorities\u2014the United Provinces were riven by religious conflict,\nas the Dutch sought to establish their identity after gaining\nindependence from Spain. The confessional rifts of the seventeenth\ncentury were certainly an important part of context in which Spinoza\ncomposed his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus [hereafter:\nTTP].\n\n\nThe early part of the seventeenth century was marked by a religious\nschism that rapidly took on political significance. In 1610,\nforty-four followers of liberal theologian Jacobus\nArminius\u2014referred to as Arminians\u2014wrote a formal\n\u201cRemonstrance,\u201d which articulated the ways in which they\ndeviated from orthodox Calvinism, particularly with respect to\nthe issues of self-determination and grace. The Arminians, or\nRemonstrants, defended religious toleration on the grounds that faith\nis expressed in the conscience of the individual, and so is not subject to the\ncoercive power of the state. The doctrinal and political views of the\nRemonstrants were opposed by the conservative Gomarists (followers of\nFranciscus Gomarus), or Counter-Remonstrants. For a little over a\ndecade (roughly 1607\u20131618), the dispute raged on, expanding outward\nfrom Holland and Utrecht.  Finally, in 1618, a national synod convened\n(the Synod of Dort) to define the public faith more clearly. The\nfallout from the Synod of Dort was disastrous for the tolerant\nArminians. The Advocate of the States of Holland, Johan\nOldenbarnevelt, who staunchly defended the Remonstrants, was put to\ndeath. And Arminians throughout the country were purged from town\ncouncils and universities (Israel 1995, 452ff).\n\n\nThe second half of the century witnessed its own major\ntheologico-political dispute in the United Provinces. At the center,\nonce again, were two theologians: Johannes Cocceius, a liberal theology\nprofessor at Leiden, and Gisbertus Voetius, Dean of the University of\nUtrecht. Disputes between Cocceian and Voetians began over abstruse\ntheological matters, but developed into a larger political and cultural\naffair. The Voetians led the assault on the Cartesian philosophy being\ntaught in the universities. They thought that the new science advocated\nby Descartes, with its mechanistic view of the material world, posed a\nthreat to Christianity in a variety of ways (Nadler 1999, 151\u20132 and\n308\u2013310). Spinoza\u2019s philosophy was reviled not only by the\nVoetians, but also by moderate Cocceian-Cartesians, who sought to\ndistance themselves from radicals.\n\n\nSpinoza was no stranger to religious persecution. As is well known,\nhe was himself excommunicated from the Jewish community in Amsterdam in\n1656. While Spinoza apparently endured the excommunication with\ncharacteristic equanimity, fellow Dutch apostate Jew, Uriel da Costa,\nwas unable to bear the indignity of excommunication from the Amsterdam\nJewish community. In 1640\u2014when Spinoza was only eight years\nold\u2014da Costa, who had denied the immortality of the soul and\nchallenged the status of the Torah as divine revelation, took his own\nlife.\n\n\nDa Costa\u2019s suicide surely made a lasting impression on\nSpinoza, but it did not affect him as personally as did the treatment\nof his friend Adriaan Koerbagh at the hands of Dutch authorities in the\nyears leading up to the publication of the TTP. In 1668 Koerbagh\npublished two treatises that provoked the wrath of the Calvinist\nclergy. In the more scandalous of the two\u2014Een Bloemhof van\nallerley lieflijkheyd (A Flower Garden of all Kinds of\nLoveliness)\u2014Koerbagh ridiculed a number of traditional religious\ndoctrines and practices, and, in the process, articulated his own\nreligious and metaphysical views. Among the shocking views that he\nadvanced were that Jesus is not divine, that God is identical with\nnature, that everything is necessitated by the laws of nature (the laws\nof God), and that miracles are impossible. These are all positions that\nSpinoza consistently endorsed. However, while Spinoza was famously\ncautious, Koerbagh was not, publishing the works in Dutch (thereby\nmaking them accessible to the general literate public) under his own\nname. Consequently, Koerbagh was tried and sentenced on charges of\nblasphemy. During his subsequent imprisonment under squalid conditions\nKoerbagh became ill. He died soon thereafter (in 1669). It is\ngenerally supposed that it was Koerbagh\u2019s imprisonment and death\nabove all else that precipitated the publication of the TTP (Nadler\n1999, 170).\n\n\nLiberal republicans were dealt a major blow in\n1672. In this so-called disaster year (rampjaar), French\ntroops, under the command of Louis XIV, invaded the United Provinces,\ncapturing a number of Dutch cities (Nadler 1999, 305). Grand\nPensionary (chief statesman and legal advisor) Johan de Witt\nshouldered much of the blame for this military embarrassment. De Witt\nwas the leader of the States of Holland for much of the republican\nperiod that followed the death of Stadholder (a quasi-monarchical\nposition held by the House of Orange) William II in 1650. After the\nFrench invasion, the stadholdership was reinstituted in the person of\nWilliam III, and De Witt was forced to resign. Shortly afterward he\nand his brother, Cornelis, were brutally killed by a zealous mob. This incident\nevoked uncommon anger in Spinoza, who was an admirer of de Witt and\nthe republican ideals for which he stood. According to one famous\naccount, Spinoza had to be restrained by his landlord from taking a\nsign reading ultimi barbarorum [\u201cultimate of\nbarbarians\u201d] to the site of the massacre (Freudenthal 1899,\n201). Spinoza\u2019s Tractatus Politicus was composed in the\naftermath of, and perhaps prompted by, the events of 1672.\n1.2 Intellectual Background\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s political thought draws from a number of sources,\nboth classical and modern. As one commentator puts it, \u201cSpinoza\nformed new conclusions from facts and concepts borrowed from\nothers\u201d (Haitsma Mulier 1980, 170). It is worth briefly\nconsidering some of the sources of the \u201cfacts and concepts\u201d\nthat he inherits.\n\n\nAt some point in the mid-1650\u2019s (around the time of his\ncherem, or excommunication) Spinoza began studying Latin with\nFranciscus Van den Enden. Van den Enden was an ex-Jesuit and radical\negalitarian with revolutionary tendencies. He was put to death in 1674\nafter having been found guilty of conspiring to depose Louis XIV in\norder to establish a free republic in Normandy. Van dan Enden was an\nanti-clerical democrat who appears to have profoundly influenced\nSpinoza. One commentator has gone so far as to call Van den Enden\n\u201cthe genius behind Spinoza,\u201d claiming that Van den\nEnden\u2019s writings \u201ccontain a political theory which is in\nfact the same as the one worked out by Spinoza\u201d (Klever 1996,\n26). Whether or not this assessment is fair, it is clear that\nSpinoza\u2019s thinking was nourished through his association with Van\nden Enden and the larger radical Cartesian circle in Amsterdam (Nyden-Bullock 2007).\n\n\nHobbes\u2019 influence on Spinoza is unmistakable. We know that\nSpinoza read De Cive carefully and that it was among his\npossessions when he died in 1677. He might also have read\nLeviathan, which appeared in Latin in 1668, as Spinoza was\ncompleting the TTP (Sacksteder\n1980). I will discuss Spinoza\u2019s work in relationship to\nHobbes\u2019 in some detail below (sections 2.1 and 2.2, below). Here\nI want to mention the impact of Dutch Hobbesians on Spinoza. Hobbesian\nthought was introduced into Dutch political discourse by Lambert van\nVelthuysen, an anti-clerical, liberal physician (Tuck 1979; Blom 1995).\nVelthuysen\u2019s Dissertatio is an unabashed defense of\nHobbes\u2019 thought, in which the duty to preserve oneself is given\npride of place (esp. Sect. XIII). Spinoza read and admired Velthuysen\nas a \u201cman of exceptional sincerity of mind,\u201d and was thus\ndisconcerted when Velthuysen denounced the TTP as the work of\na dangerous atheist (Epistles 42 and 43).\n\n\nAside from Velthuysen, the other primary Dutch conduits for\nHobbesian thought prior to Spinoza were the De la Court brothers (Petry\n1984; Kossmann 2000). Most of the De la Courts\u2019 writings were\npublished by Pieter De la Court after the death of his brother Johan in\n1660. However, because it remains unclear how much Pieter added and how\nmuch he took credit for the work his studious younger brother, I will refer to\nthese authors of these writings simply as the De la Courts, so as to\navoid attribution problems. The De la Courts were ardent republicans\nwho maintained good relations with Johan De Witt. Indeed, De Witt is\nthought to have written two chapters in the second edition of their\nbook Interest van Holland (see Petry 1984, 152). The De la\nCourts adopted the basic features of Hobbesian anthropology, but\neschewed juridical concepts like \u201cright\u201d and\n\u201ccontract\u201d (see Malcolm 1991, 548), opting to analyze the\ncivil condition in terms of the competing interests of participants.\nAccording to them, the aim of the state is to ensure that the interests\nof rulers are tied to the interests of the ruled, which is possible\nonly if one adopts a series of institutional measures, such as the use\nof blind balloting, the removal of hereditary posts, and the rotation\nof offices. Republics, they argued, will be marked by greater checks\nagainst self-interested legislation than monarchies (see Blom 1993).\nSpinoza evidently studied these works carefully; his institutional\nrecommendations in the Tractatus Politicus [hereafter: TP]\nreflect his debt to the De la Courts (Petry 1984; Haitsma Mulier\n1980).\n\n\nIt was likely the writings of the De la Courts that impressed upon\nSpinoza the perspicacity of Niccolo Machiavelli. The notion of\nbalancing the interests of competing parties was ultimately derived\nfrom Machiavelli (see Haitsma Mulier 1993, 254\u2013255). Spinoza\u2019s\nPolitical Treatise is shot through with Machiavellian insights\nand recommendations. Right at the outset of the work, Spinoza parrots\nMachiavelli\u2019s critique of utopian theorizing, elevating statesmen\nover philosophers, since only the latter begin with a realistic\nconception of human psychology (TP 1/1; cf. Machiavelli,\nThe Prince I.15). Machiavellian realism pervades Spinoza\u2019s\npolitical writings, playing a particularly significant role in the\nconstitutional theorizing of the TP. Spinoza, like Machiavelli,\nunderstood that prescriptions for improving the governance of a state\ncan be offered only after one has a proper diagnosis of the problems\nand a proper grasp of human nature (see Steinberg 2018a).\n2. Basic Features of Spinoza\u2019s Political Philosophy\n\n\nThree of the most striking and important claims of Spinoza\u2019s\nEthics are that (1) all things come to exist and act\nnecessarily from the laws of God\u2019s nature (e.g., EIP29\nand EIP33), (2) nature does not act on account of some end or\npurpose (EI Appendix), and (3) nature is everywhere and always\nthe same (EIII Preface). Collectively, these three claims\nentail that human behavior, like the behavior of everything else, is\nfully necessitated by, and explicable through, the immutable\u2014and\nnon-providential\u2014laws of God or Nature. This forms a significant\npart of the metaphysical backdrop against which Spinoza develops his\npolitical theory. For the sake of simplicity, I will call the view that\nis constituted by these three theses Spinoza\u2019s naturalism. This\nnaturalism led him to adopt bold views about the source and\nstatus of rights, obligations, and laws that distinguished his work from that of\nother seventeenth-century political theorists.\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s naturalism excludes the possibility of a transcendent God. Those\nwho believe in a transcendent God \u201cimagine that there are two\npowers, distinct from each other, the power of God and the power of\nnatural things\u2026. they imagine the power of God to be like the\nauthority of royal majesty, and the power of nature to be like a force\nand impetus\u201d (TTP 6/81). Of course, on Spinoza\u2019s account, God is\nnot a transcendent legislator, God is nature itself. Consequently, all accounts of right that are rooted in God\u2019s legislating will are specious. This is a direct rebuke not only of defenders of\nthe divine right of kings, but also of most accounts of natural rights\nas entitlements that were embraced by many seventeenth-century\ntheorists.\n\n\nMoreover, this naturalism also rules out the possibility of a normative order of things, or a way that\nthings should be, distinct from the actual order of\nthings. This undermines the teleological assumptions that form the\nbasis of natural law theory, whether Thomistic or Protestant. Even\nthose who wished to separate natural law from theology (e.g.,\nPufendorf), and those who de-emphasized the role of God\u2019s\nwill\u2014as Grotius does in his famous etiam si daremus\npassage\u2014still supposed that there is a way that things ought to\nbe, a normative natural order that can be decoupled from the actual\norder of things. According to this view, humans act contrary to nature\nwhen they act contrary to the prescriptions of right reason. Spinoza\nattacks this view, according to which \u201cthe ignorant violate the\norder of nature rather than conform to it; they think of men in nature\nas a state within a state [imperium in imperio]\u201d (TP\n2/6). The phrase \u201cimperium in imperio\u201d famously\nappears also in the preface to Ethics III, where Spinoza is\ncharacterizing the non-naturalist view that he opposes. In both of\nthese passages, Spinoza criticizes the assumption that man is governed\nby his own set of rational, normative laws, rather than the laws that\ngovern the rest of nature. It is precisely this position that Spinoza\nundercuts when he writes in the Ethics that \u201cthe laws\nand rules of Nature\u2026are always and everywhere the same\u201d\n(EIII preface) and in the TP that \u201cwhether man\nis led by reason or solely by desire, he does nothing that is not in\naccordance with the laws and rules of nature\u201d (TP 2/5).\n\n\nIn short, by adopting the view that nature is univocal and that man is\ngoverned by the same laws as everything else in nature, Spinoza\nrejects the natural law tradition (Curley 1991; A. Garrett 2003; for\ncontrasting views, see Kisner 2010 and Miller 2012). And even if\nSpinoza\u2019s naturalism is viewed as part of a larger naturalistic trend\nin Dutch political thought (Blom 1995), his disavowal of normative\nconceptions of nature and rejection of teleology indicates a clear\nbreak with tradition. To appreciate the depth and significance of\nSpinoza\u2019s naturalism, it will be helpful to compare his views on\nnatural right and obligation to Hobbes\u2019.\n2.1 Hobbes and Spinoza on the Right of Nature\n\n\nOne of the most notorious features of Spinoza\u2019s political\nthought is his account of natural right. He introduces this concept in\nTTP 16, where he boldly writes:\n\n\nBy the right and order of nature I merely mean the rules determining\nthe nature of each individual thing by which we conceive it is\ndetermined naturally to exist and to behave in a certain way. For\nexample fish are determined by nature to swim and big fish to eat\nlittle ones, and therefore it is by sovereign natural right that fish\nhave possession of the water and that big fish eat small fish. For it\nis certain that nature, considered wholly in itself, has a sovereign\nright to do everything that it can do, i.e., the right of nature\nextends as far as its power extends\u2026since the universal power\nof the whole of nature is nothing but the power of all individual\nthings together, it follows that each individual thing has the\nsovereign right to do everything that it can do, or the right of each\nthing extends so far as its determined power extends. (TTP 16, 195;\ncf. TP 2/4). \n\n\nIn claiming that the right of nature is coextensive with the power\nof nature and that this applies\nmutatis mutandis to the individuals in nature, Spinoza is\nsimply rejecting non-naturalism, rather than making a positive\nnormative claim. So although Spinoza is often seen as subscribing to\nthe view that \u201cmight makes right\u201d (see Barbone and Rice\n2000, 19; McShea 1968, 139), this is misleading if it is\ntaken as a normative claim. In fact, I take it that the coextensivity thesis is not to be\nunderstood as offering a new normative standard; rather, it is\nintended as a denial of any transcendental standard of justice (see\nCurley 1996, 322; Balibar 1998, 59). To say that something is done by\nright in Spinoza\u2019s sense is just to say that there is nothing in\nvirtue of which that action can be judged impermissible. So, even if\nSpinoza\u2019s account implies that Cort\u00e9s conquered the Aztecs by\nright, it does not follow that it was necessarily the right, or\nproper, thing to do (see TP 5/1; see section 2.3).\n\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s brazen denial of natural proscriptions on what one\ncan do roused the ire of early readers (e.g., Pufendorf 1934, 159). Of\ncourse, Thomas Hobbes, Spinoza\u2019s great predecessor, had made a\nsimilar claim. Indeed, Spinoza\u2019s account of natural right is\noften taken as evidence that he is a Hobbesian. Hobbes\u2019 account\nof natural right has been the subject of much interpretative dispute,\nin part because it seems to undergo a shift between his early political\nwritings and Leviathan. In De Cive Hobbes defines\nright as \u201cthe liberty each man has of using his natural faculties\nin accordance with right reason\u201d (1.7). In other words, natural\nright is the liberty to do anything consistent with the natural law\n(ibid. 2.1). This includes the right to do anything that one judges to\nbe necessary for one\u2019s preservation (1.8\u20131.9). Hobbes adds one\nproviso here, which might be called the \u201csincerity clause,\u201d\nnamely that one violates the law of nature, or acts without right, when\none acts in a way that one does not sincerely believe contributes to\none\u2019s preservation (1.10n). And later Hobbes suggests that\nbecause \u201cdrunkenness and cruelty\u201d cannot sincerely be\nthought to contribute to self-preservation, drunken and cruel actions\nare not performed by right, even in the state of nature (ibid., 3.27).\nIn short, as A. G. Wernham puts it, on Hobbes\u2019 view, man\u2019s\nnatural right \u201ccovers only some of his actions\u201d (Wernham\n1958, 14). Specifically, it covers those actions that are not contrary\nto the law of nature.\n\n\nIn Leviathan, however, Hobbes seems to advance an account\nof natural right that is apparently not bound by such normative\nconstraints (Ch. 14). But while it may seem that in the later work\nHobbes strips the concept of natural right of all normative content,\neven the view expressed in Leviathan may be seen to be at odds\nwith a thoroughgoing naturalism. To see this, consider Spinoza\u2019s\nreply to his friend to Jarig Jelles, when asked what sets his views\napart from Hobbes\u2019:\n\n\nWith regard to political theory, the difference between Hobbes and\nmyself, which is the subject of your inquiry, consists in this, that I\nalways preserve the natural right in its entirety [ego naturale jus\nsemper sartum tectum conservo], and I hold that the sovereign\npower in a State has right over a subject only in proportion to the\nexcess of its power over that of a subject (Epistle 50).\n\n\nWhat Spinoza is criticizing here is the Hobbesian view of contracts\n(covenants) or the transference of one\u2019s natural right. The\ntransferability or alienability of one\u2019s natural right to judge\nhow to defend oneself serves as the foundation of Hobbes\u2019\npolitical theory; it allows him to explain the formation of the\ncommonwealth and the legitimacy of the sovereign. In Spinoza\u2019s\nview, however, Hobbes violates naturalism here. By conceiving of\none\u2019s natural right as something like an entitlement that can be\ntransferred, which in turn leads him to drive a wedge between right and\npower in the commonwealth, Hobbes never fully rids his account of the\nvestiges of the juridical tradition that Spinoza sought to\noverturn.\n2.2 Hobbes and Spinoza on Obligation\n\n\nThe difference between Hobbes and Spinoza on right bears directly on\ntheir distinct accounts of obligation. Hobbes thinks that we incur\nbinding obligations when we make pledges under the appropriate\nconditions. By contrast, Spinoza maintains that \u201cthe validity of\nan agreement rests on its utility, without which the agreement\nautomatically becomes null and void\u201d (TTP 16/182; cf. TP\n2/12). To demand otherwise would be absurd, since men are bound by\nnature to choose what appears to be the greater good or lesser\nevil. We are bound by nature to act on our strongest interest and\ncannot be obligated by previous agreements to break this inviolable\npsychological law of nature.\n\n\nBy adhering to a strict naturalism about right and obligation and\nmaintaining that \u201cthe sovereign power in a State has right over a\nsubject only in proportion to the excess of its power over that of a\nsubject\u201d (Epistle 50), Spinoza, unlike Hobbes, places the burden\nof political stability on the sovereign rather than the subject (see\nWernham 1958, 27). The commonwealth must be structured so as to promote\ncompliance; when there is excessive vice or non-compliance, the blame\nmust be \u201claid at the door of the commonwealth\u201d (TP 5/3).\nSo, whereas Hobbes argues that the sovereign is always vested with\nnearly absolute legislative authority, Spinoza claims that \u201csince\nthe right of a commonwealth is determined by the collective power of a\npeople, the greater the number of subjects who are given cause by a\ncommonwealth to join in conspiracy against it, the more must its power\nand right be diminished\u201d (TP 3/9). If a sovereign is to maintain\nits right, it must legislate wisely, so as not to incite insurrection.\nSo while Spinoza does not accord to the people a proper right of\nrevolution, he proposes a naturalistic equivalent, since the right of\nthe state is essentially constituted, and limited, by the power of the\npeople (TP 2/17) (see Sharp 2013).\n\n\nThus, when Spinoza points to the differences between his view of\nnatural right and Hobbes\u2019 in his letter to Jelles, differences\nthat might appear negligible to the casual reader, he is identifying a\nsignificant distinction (see Wernham 1958, 35). Spinoza\u2019s\nthoroughgoing naturalism leads him to reject the sharp distinction that\nHobbes draws between civil state\u2014the product of\nartifice\u2014and the state of nature, along with the concomitant\nconception of obligation that arises with the inception of the\ncommonwealth. But given his naturalism and repudiation of rights and\nobligations as traditionally understood, one might be left wondering\nhow or whether Spinoza could offer a normative political theory at\nall.\n2.3 Spinoza and Normativity\n\n\nAs Edwin Curley rightly points out, to deny that there is a transcendental\nstandard of justice is not to deny that there is any normative standard\nby which we can evaluate action (Curley 1996). Even if one can act\nirrationally without violating nature that does not mean that all of\none\u2019s actions have the same normative status. As Spinoza puts it,\n\u201cit is one thing, I say, to defend oneself, to preserve oneself,\nto give judgment, etc., by right, another thing to defend and preserve\noneself in the best way and to give the best judgment\u201d (TP 5/1).\nThe goodness of an action is to be judged in relation to whether the\naction aids one\u2019s striving to preserve and augment one\u2019s power (see\nEIVP18S; TP 2/8; TTP 16/181). The striving to preserve and\naugment one\u2019s power, which constitutes one\u2019s actual essence\n(EIIIP7), provides a standard for moral judgments: things are\ngood or bad to the extent that they aid or diminish one\u2019s power of\nacting (Curley 1973). And just as the individual ought to do those\nthings that maximize his or her own power or welfare, Spinoza takes it\nas axiomatic that the state ought to do those things that maximize the\npower of the people as a whole (e.g., TTP 16/184).\n3. The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus\n\n\nAs indicated above, throughout the seventeenth century the United\nProvinces were torn apart by disputes concerning, among other things, the\npolitical authority of the church. Spinoza\u2019s Tractatus\nTheologico-Politicus can be seen as an intervention in this broad\ndispute. The stated goals of this work were to parry charges of atheism\n(Spinoza was hilariously unsuccessful in this respect), to oppose the\nprejudices of the theologians, and to defend the freedom to\nphilosophize (Epistle 30). My exposition of the political claims of the\nTTP will focus on the last two goals. Specifically, I will look at the\npolitical significance of Spinoza\u2019s critique of superstition and\nconsider his arguments for the freedom of philosophizing. This will be\nfollowed by an analysis of the role of the social contract in the\nTTP.\n3.1 Countering Superstition\n\n\nThe TTP contains a good deal of what has come to be known as biblical\ncriticism. Through careful linguistic and historical exegesis Spinoza\nidentifies numerous textual inconsistencies, which, with some\nphilosophical buttressing, lead Spinoza to deny the exalted status of\nprophets, the objective reality of miracles, and ultimately the divine origin of\nthe Pentateuch. The broad features of his critique are vital to our\nunderstanding of Spinoza\u2019s response to the \u201ctheologico-political\nproblem\u201d (Smith 1997) that plagued the Dutch Republic. (For two\nrecent first-rate monographs on the TTP that situate Spinoza\u2019s\ncritique of Scripture in historical context, see Nadler 2011 and James\n2012)\n\n\nAmong the politically relevant claims that Spinoza makes in the\nfirst fifteen chapters of the work is that Scripture does not compete\nwith philosophy as a source of knowledge; nor do the injunctions of\nScripture compete with the commands of civil authorities. By separating\nfaith from reason and making religion\u2019s role in the public realm\nsubordinate to that of the state, Spinoza tries to sanitize religion of\nits pernicious superstitious aspects. We may call the claim that faith is distinct\nfrom reason the separation thesis and the claim that religious\nlaw is dependent on and determined by civil law the single\nauthority thesis.\n3.2 Separation Thesis\n\n\nAt one point Spinoza calls the task of establishing the separation\nof faith from philosophy \u201cthe principal purpose of the whole\nwork\u201d (TTP 14/179). And a good deal of the biblical criticism in the\nTTP can be understood as paving the way for the separation thesis,\nsince in the earlier chapters much of what Spinoza is doing is\nundermining the claim of Scripture as a source of genuine knowledge.\nThe value of Scripture does not lie in its mysteries or its abstruse\nmetaphysical content, since to the extent that it is concerned with\nthese matters it is\u2014by Spinoza\u2019s lights\u2014utterly\nconfused. Rather, it lies in the simple moral truths that Scripture\ncontains, which encourage obedience to the state (Ch. 13). The books of\nScripture are written for an unsophisticated, uneducated audience and\nconvey information in a way that is suited to such an audience, in the\nform of fantastical accounts and parables that appeal to the\nimagination rather than the intellect. And so, Spinoza argues, although\nScripture may appear to reveal profound truths about God\u2019s nature\nand his participation in our world, its salient message is not\nmetaphysical, but moral: \u201cScripture requires nothing of men other than\nobedience, and condemns not ignorance, but disobedience\u201d\n(TTP 13/173). The ethical message of loving God and loving one\u2019s\nneighbor is the backbone of all religion (Ch. 12), the whole of divine\nlaw (TTP 14/178).\n\n\nThis ethical understanding of religion is reflected in the way that\nSpinoza re-conceives of several crucial religious concepts. For\ninstance, he claims that a text is sacred to the extent that it fosters\ndevotion to God and charity to others (e.g., TTP 12/151) and that a\nperson\u2019s piety is measured in terms of her or his commitment to\njustice, charity, and obedience. Since the aim of religion is obedience\nand good works, and the aim of philosophy is truth, religion and\nphilosophy ought not to be seen as rivals. By separating religion and\nphilosophy, faith and reason, Spinoza distances himself both from those\nwho\u2014like Maimonides and Spinoza\u2019s friend Ludwig\nMeyer\u2014contort Scripture to make it conform to reason and those\nwho claim that where Scripture\nconflicts with reason it is reason that we must renounce (TTP, Ch. 15). According to\nSpinoza, because reason and faith have separate domains, neither is\nsubservient to the other. The separation thesis has profound political\nimport, since by claiming that religion is not, like philosophy, a\nsource of knowledge, Spinoza undercuts the grounds for the theological\ndisputes that were the source of considerable unrest in the Dutch\nRepublic. The dominant message of the separation thesis is that\nScripture is not the source of metaphysical knowledge and so we ought\nnot to treat it as authoritative in these matters.\n3.3 Single Authority Thesis\n\n\nHowever, since Scripture does have a positive socio-political function in promoting justice and charity, one might wonder\nhow much authority the clergy has in public matters. Spinoza\u2019s\nresponse is that \u201cauthority in sacred matters belongs wholly to\nthe sovereign powers \u201d (Ch.  19, title). Like Hobbes, he\nembraces the Erastian position that religious law is realized through\nthe will of the civil authority (TTP, Ch. 19). The crux of the single\nauthority thesis is this: the sovereign is the sole civil and\nreligious authority. Indeed, because piety consists in practicing\njustice and obedience, and because there is no standard of justice\nother than the will of the sovereign (TTP 19, 239ff; EIVP37S2),\n\u201cit is also the duty of the sovereign authority alone to lay\ndown how a person should behave with piety towards their neighbor,\nthat is, to determine how one is obliged to obey God\u201d (TTP 19,\n242\u20133). The obvious, yet important, implication of the single\nauthority thesis is that clerics are at best spiritual advisors with\nno real claim to political power. The problem of dual allegiances\n(divine and civil) is overcome, since the two authorities converge in\nthe form of the sovereign.\n\n\nThe argument against ecclesiastical power here depends upon the\nsupposition that there is no transcendental standard of piety. Of\ncourse, a sovereign could delegate authority to religious\nfunctionaries, but Spinoza cautions against this, using the case of\nthe Hebrews to illustrate the dangers of priestly authority. The\ndecisive turn that precipitated the decline of the first Hebrew state\ncame with the ascendance of a priestly order. On Spinoza\u2019s account,\nunder Moses, civil law and religion \u201cwere one and the same\nthing\u201d (TTP 17, 213) and the Jews lived peaceably.  However, when\nthe priests\u2014chiefly the Levites\u2014were given the right to\ninterpret divine law, \u201ceach of them began seeking glory for his\nown name in religion and everything else...As a result religion\ndegenerated into fatal superstition\u201d (TTP 18, 231). The message here\nhad clear application in the Dutch context, where, as we\u2019ve noted,\nCalvinist theocrats\u2014who formed a menacing alliance with the\nhouse of Orange\u2014were increasingly wielding power to the\ndetriment of peace and stability (see Nadler 1999, 283\u20134).\n\n\nSpinoza punctuates his historical analysis of the Hebrew state by\ndrawing four lessons about the theologico-political problem, three of\nwhich are relevant here: (1) civil stability requires the limitation of\necclesiastical power; (2) it is disastrous for religious\nleaders to govern speculative matters; and (3) the sovereign\nmust remain the sole legislator. These historical observations support Spinoza\u2019s principle of toleration, which I discuss\nbelow.\n3.4 Positive Function of Religion\n\n\nDespite its potential for harm, Spinoza thinks that religion can\nperform a positive social function. It can help to breed an obedient\nspirit, making people pliable to civil law\u2014in this way religion\nplays a role in bolstering the state (e.g., TTP 14/168; cf. Moses\u2019 use of\na state religion, TTP 5/66). For instance, the ceremonial laws and\npractices of the Jews helped to foster and preserve cohesion among an\nignorant, nomadic populace (TTP Ch. 3 and Ch. 5). The central moral\nmessage of religion\u2014namely, to love one\u2019s neighbor (e.g., TTP 14,\n179)\u2014may be understood through reason; but Scripture presents\nthis message in a manner that is suited to the understanding of the\nmasses (TTP 14, 184; see Strauss 1965, Ch. 9 and Smith 1997,\nCh. 2). Religion also seems to play a crucial role in promoting\ncompliance with the law.  Michael Rosenthal has suggested that in\nSpinoza\u2019s scheme \u201ctranscendental beliefs\u201d assist in overcoming free rider problems; defections from agreements and\nnon-compliance with the law would likely be widespread among human\nbeings were it not for religion (Rosenthal 1998).\n\n\nThe salutary function of religion is undermined when sectarianism\nemerges. When groups like the Pharisees begin to regard themselves as\nspecial, disparaging and persecuting other groups, civil order is\ndisrupted. In order to prevent such fissures, Spinoza puts forth a\nuniversal or civil religion that captures the moral core of a plurality\nof faiths, to which all citizens can subscribe, irrespective of what\nother private beliefs they hold (TTP 14, 182\u20133). Like Rousseau after him,\nSpinoza thought that a universal public religion could bolster civic\nsolidarity, channeling religious passions into social benefits.\n3.5 Spinoza\u2019s Argument for Toleration\n\n\nSpinoza is often remembered for his contribution to the liberal\ntradition, due, in large part, to his defense of the freedoms of\nthought and speech in TTP 20. However, the tolerationism expressed in\nTTP 20 appears to stand in tension with the Erastian claim of TTP 19.\nHow can Spinoza be a liberal about religious practice while also\ndefending the view that the state maintains full right over matters of\nreligion (TTP, Ch. 19)? There are three things worth noting here. First, unlike Locke\u2019s tolerationism, Spinoza\u2019s defense of\ncivil liberties in TTP 20 is not fundamentally a defense freedom of\nworship (Israel 2001, 265\u2013266). Rather, it is essentially a defense of\nthe freedom to philosophize; freedom of worship is at best an\nincidental byproduct of this primary aim. Second, Spinoza\ndistinguishes between outward expressions of faith and one\u2019s\ninward worship of God. Sovereign authority over religious expression\nconcerns only the former, leaving the latter the domain of the\nindividual, for reasons that we will examine in a moment. Both of\nthese positions can be understood as lending support to the Arminian\ncause against Calvinist Theocrats (Nadler 1999, 12). Finally, it\nshould be mentioned that Spinoza\u2019s denial that freedoms concerning\noutward religious expression must be protected points to the limited\nnature of his brand of toleration. The sovereign retains full\ndiscretion to determine which actions are acceptable and what forms of\nspeech are seditious. As Lewis Feuer ruefully notes, Spinoza does not\noffer anything resembling Oliver Wendell Holmes\u2019s standard of\n\u201cclear and present danger\u201d to constrain sovereign\nintervention (1987, 114).\n\n\nWhat are Spinoza\u2019s arguments for his, albeit limited, defense\nfreedoms of thought and speech? The first argument is that it is\nstrictly impossible to control another\u2019s beliefs completely\n(20, 250\u201351). Since right is coextensive with power,\nlacking the power to control beliefs entails lacking the right to do\nso. However, since Spinoza admits that beliefs can be influenced in\nmyriad ways, even if not fully controlled, this argument amounts to a\nrather restricted defense of freedom of conscience.\n\n\nNext, the argument shifts from considering what the sovereign\ncan do to what it would be practical or\nprudent for a sovereign to do. Spinoza offers a battery of\npragmatic reasons in defense of non-interference. For instance, he\nargues that \u201ca state can never succeed very far in attempting to\nforce people to speak as the sovereign power commands\u201d (TTP 20,\n251). Men are naturally inclined to express what they believe (ibid.),\nand so just as attempts to regulate beliefs fail, so do attempts to\nregulate the expressions of these beliefs. Moreover, even if a state\nwere to regulate speech, this would only result in the erosion of good\nfaith [fides] on which civil associations depend, since men\nwould be \u201cthinking one thing and saying something else\u201d\n(TTP 20, 255). It is thus foolish to seek to regulate all speech, even if\nit is also \u201cvery dangerous\u201d to grant unlimited freedom of\nspeech (TTP 20, 252).\n\n\nSpinoza also argues that in general the more oppressively a sovereign\ngoverns, the more rebellious the citizens will be, since most people\nare \u201cso constituted that there is nothing they would more\nreluctantly put up with than that the opinions they belief to be true\nshould be outlawed\u201d (TTP 20, 255). The source of oppression and the\nresistance to it have a common root on Spinoza\u2019s account, namely,\nambition, or the desire for others to approve of the same things that\nwe do (see\nEIIIP29; cf. Rosenthal 2001 and 2003). Men being constituted\nas they are, when differences of opinion arise\u2014as they inevitably\ndo\u2014they are inclined to foist their standard on others and to\nresist others\u2019 attempts to do the same. So, however common\nattempts to regulate the beliefs, speech, and behavior of others may\nbe, it is politically unstable to do so. Moreover, Spinoza argues that\nit is often the least wise and the most obnoxious who initiate moral\ncrusades, and just as it is often the wisest and most peace-loving who\nare the targets of such campaigns (TTP 20, 256\u201358).\n\n\nIt is worth noting that these arguments in defense of civil liberties\nare thoroughly pragmatic; they rely on psychological principles and\nempirical observations to illustrate the instability and imprudence of\noppressive governance (see Steinberg 2010b). They are not principled\narguments that depend on rights or the intrinsic value of liberty,\nmuch to the frustration of some commentators (Feuer 1987; Curley\n1996).\n3.6 Social Contract in the TTP\n\n\nA good deal of scholarly attention has been placed on Spinoza\u2019s\naccount of the social contract in the TTP. Spinoza introduces the\ncontract in Chapter 16, when considering how people escape the\npre-civil condition. Here he claims that \u201c[men] had to make a\nfirm decision, and reach agreement, to decide everything by the sole\ndictate of reason\u201d (TTP 16, 198), which requires, as he later makes\nclear, that each transfers one\u2019s right to determine how to live and\ndefend himself to the sovereign (TTP 16, 199\u2013200);\ncf. EIVP37S2). He also cites the establishment of the Hebrew\nstate, with Moses as the absolute sovereign, as an historical example\nof a social contract (TTP 19, 240). The social contract seems to confer\nnearly boundless authority on the sovereign. So long as we are\nrational, \u201cwe are obliged to carry out absolutely all commands\nof the sovereign power, however absurd they may be\u201d (TTP 16,\n200).\n\n\nHowever, if Spinoza really relies upon the social contract as a\nsource of legitimacy, several problems arise. First of all, it seems\nunlikely that such a contract could ever have been formed, since the\nlegitimating strength of a social contract depends on farsighted\nrationality that Spinoza clearly thinks most people lack (see Den Uyl\n1983).\n\n\nBut even if such a contract were possible, a much greater problem\nremains for Spinoza. How can we take seriously a legitimacy-conferring\ncontract without violating the naturalism that is at the core of\nSpinoza\u2019s metaphysics? What is this right that is surrendered or\ntransferred? And how can one really transfer one\u2019s right, given\nthe coextensivity of right and power? Spinoza\u2019s\nnaturalistic, utility-based account of obligation (see 2.2, above) also seems to preclude the possibility of a binding social contract.\n\n\nSome commentators take these problems with Spinoza\u2019s social\ncontract to be insurmountable, and for this reason they regard him as\ncoming to his senses when he abandons the contract in the TP (Wernham\n1958, 25\u201327). Others have tried to reinterpret the contract in a way\nthat is makes it consistent with his naturalism. For instance, Barbone\nand Rice distinguish between two concepts that have been rendered in\nEnglish as \u201cpower.\u201d On the one hand there is\npotentia, which is the power that is essential to the\nindividual (Barbone and Rice 2000, 17). This power in inalienable. What\nis transferable is one\u2019s potestas, i.e. one\u2019s\nauthority (Barbone and Rice 2000, 17) or coercive power (Blom 1995,\n211).\n\n\nWhile this interpretation has the virtue of cohering with\nSpinoza\u2019s claim that he \u201calways preserve[s] the natural\nright in its entirety\u201d (Epistle 50), since one\u2019s right, or\npotentia, always remains intact, it leaves unexplained how\npotestas, which Barbone and Rice describe as a\n\u201csuper-added\u201d capacity, fits into the natural order. What\ncan it mean to possess, transfer, or renounce one\u2019s\npotestas? And how can transferring or revoking it result in an\nobligation, given Spinoza\u2019s utility-based account of\nobligation?\n\n\nPerhaps the best way to understand what it means to possess or give up one\npotestas is in psychological terms. Curley suggests this when\nhe looks to Hobbes\u2019 claim in Behemoth that the\n\u201cthe power of the mighty hath no foundation but in the opinion\nand belief of the people\u201d (EW VI, 184, 237\u2014cited in Curley\n1996, 326) as a way of understanding Spinoza\u2019s conception of\nsovereign formation. One could also cite Hobbes\u2019 famous claim in\nLeviathan that \u201creputation of power is power\u201d (Ch.\n10) as an expression of the same point. These passages can be\nunderstood as supporting the view that power is not transferred by way\nof a speech act, but rather by standing in the psychological thrall of\nthe sovereign. Sovereignty is the product of psychological deference\nrather than the formal transference of rights or titles. \n\n\nSome evidence in support of this psychological interpretation comes in\nTTP 17, where Spinoza claims that sovereign power or authority derives\nfrom the will of its subjects to obey (TTP 17, 209\u201310; cf. TP\n2/9\u201310). There are places in the text, however, when Spinoza\nseems to imply that we have obligations to the sovereign irrespective\nof our psychological or motivational state. In some of these\ninstances, a careful reading reveals that nothing of the sort is\nimplied. For instance, his claim that \u201cwe are obliged to carry\nabsolutely all the commands of the sovereign power, however absurd\nthey may be\u201d (TTP 16, 200) is contingent on our behaving rationally\nand wanting to avoid being regarded as enemies of the state. Still,\nthere are other places when he does imply that de facto\nobedience is neither necessary nor sufficient for establishing the\nlegitimacy of a civil body. For instance, he claims that the sovereign\nalone has right over religious matters such as interpreting Scripture,\nexcommunicating heretics, and making provisions for the poor (TTP 19, 239\n- 40), despite the fact that the church had, in fact, been exercising\npower in these matters. But this too can be reconciled with Spinoza\u2019s\nnaturalism, provided that we understand that the power or authority of\nclerics devolves upon them from the power or authority of the\nsovereign.\n4. The Tractatus Politicus\n\n\nOne might wonder why Spinoza, having published the TTP in 1670, spent\nthe last years of his life (until his death in 1677) working on a\nsecond political treatise that covers some of the same ground as the\nfirst. It is tempting to suppose that he must have come to reject many\nof his earlier views. However, with the possible exception of his view\nof the social contract (see 4.1), there is little evidence that\nSpinoza came to reject any of the central claims of his earlier\ntreatise. Rather, the TP is distinguished from the earlier treatise\nchiefly by its aims and rhetorical style. Whereas the TTP was an\noccasional piece, written for an audience of liberal Christian\ntheologians to address the problems posed by officious Calvinist\ntheocrats, the TP is concerned with the general organization of the\nstate and was written for philosophers. In the later treatise, Spinoza\nabandons what has been described as the \u201ctheological idiom of\npopular persuasion\u201d in favor of the dispassionate style of a\npolitical scientist (Feuer 1987, 151; cf. Balibar 1998, 50).\n\n\nThe TP is a fitting sequel to the Ethics (Matheron 1969).\nWhereas the Ethics reveals the path to individual freedom, the\nTP reveals the extent to which individual freedom depends on\ncivil institutions (Steinberg 2018a). We should not be surprised to find Spinoza\u2019s philosophy taking a civic turn near the end of his life. From his earliest writings, he claims that he is\nconcerned not just to perfect his own nature but also \u201cto form a\nsociety of the kind that is desirable, so that as many as possible may\nattain [a flourishing life] as easily and surely as possible\u201d\n(TdIE, \u00a714). The TP may be seen as Spinoza\u2019s\nattempt to articulate some of the conditions for the possibility of such a\nsociety.\n\n\nThe work can be divided into three sections. In the first section\n(roughly through Chapter 4), Spinoza discusses the metaphysical basis\nof the state and the natural limits of state power. In the second\nsection (Chapter 5), Spinoza lays out the general aims of the state.\nAnd in the third section (Chapter 6 to the end), Spinoza gives specific\nrecommendations for how various regime forms\u2014monarchy,\naristocracy, and democracy\u2014are to be constituted so as to satisfy\nthe aims of the state as set out in section two.\n4.1 Metaphysical Background\n\n\nIn the early chapters of the TP, Spinoza puts forth his naturalistic\nprogram, beginning with the premise that the state, like everything\nelse, is a natural thing (res naturalis), governed by the\nlaws of nature (see Bartuschat 1984, 30). It is in this light that we\ncan appreciate Spinoza\u2019s claim that \u201cone should not look for the\ncauses and natural foundations of the state in the teachings of\nreason\u201d (1/7). It has seemed to some (e.g., Wernham 1958, 265n)\nthat this statement indicates a sharp break with the contractarian\nconception of the state formation advanced in the TTP. This view is\nsupported by the fact that virtually no mention of a social contract\nis made in the later treatise (Wernham 1958, 25; Matheron 1990). This\nwould also fit with Lewis Feuer\u2019s suggestion that the later treatise\nbetrays a dimmer view of the masses, perhaps brought on by the events\nof 1672 (1987, ch. 5). At the very least, this passage illustrates a\nbreak with the ultra-rational conception of the social contract that\nappears to lie behind some of the claims of the TTP.\n\n\nHowever, Spinoza\u2019s account of the state as the spontaneous product of\nnatural passions is perfectly consistent with the psychological\ninterpretation of the contract (\u00a73.6, above). Indeed, he seems to\nsupport such a view in his work when he claims that individuals are\nunder the right [sub potestate] of the commonwealth (3/5), regardless of whether they\nobey its laws from fear or love of civic order (2/10; 3/8). They stand\nunder the right or power of the sovereign, because they are held (psychologically) in its sway.\n\n\nBut what exactly does it mean to deduce the foundations of the state\nfrom the nature of men? In the TP Spinoza tells us that men, who are\nindividually weak and effectively powerless compared to the aggregated\npowers of others (2/15; Cf. EIVP5dem.), come together as a\nresult of \u201csome common emotion...a common hope, or common fear,\nor desire to avenge some common injury\u201d (6/1; see Matheron 1969\nand 1990). The state is thus an unintended, but salutary, outcome of\nthe natural interplay of human passions. In this sense, the civil\ncondition is a natural condition.  Because, on this view, stable\npatterns of behavior emerge from blind interplay of the passions,\nthereby overcoming coordination problems, some have regarded Spinoza\u2019s\naccount as \u201cevolutionary,\u201d anticipating the theory of\nunintended consequences found in Mandeville, Smith, and Hayek (Den Uyl\n1985 and 1983). However, Spinoza says precious little about the\nprocess of civil formation itself in the TP, making such an\ninterpretation deeply underdetermined, at best. While one can, like\nDen Uyl (ibid.) or Matheron (1969, 1990), construct a genetic story on\nthe basis of Spinozistic psychology, the account that Spinoza himself\noffers is quite thin.\n4.2 General Aim of the State\n\n\nHaving established in the preceding chapters that anything that can\nbe done is done by right, Spinoza turns directly the question of how\nthe sovereign should exercise its power in Chapter Five,\nnoting that there is an important distinction between doing something\nby right and doing it in the best way (5/1). Here his concern is just\nto delineate the general aim of the state on the basis of which he can\ngive more fine-grained recommendations relative to regime forms (see\n4.3). The fundamental aim of the state, according to Spinoza, is\n\u201cpeace and security of life\u201d [pax vitaeque\nsecuritas] (5/2). To grasp what Spinoza means here we must try to\nunderstand what he means by peace. Spinoza rejects Hobbes\u2019\ndefinition of peace as the \u201cabsence of war\u201d (De\nCive 1, 12), calling it instead \u201ca virtue which comes from strength\nof mind\u201d (5/4), or a \u201cunion or harmony of minds\u201d\n(6/4). It is one thing for a state to persist or to avoid the ravages\nof war, it is quite another for the state to flourish. Spinoza makes\nthis point by way of an organic metaphor:\n\n\nSo when we say that the best state is one where men pass their lives\nin harmony, I am speaking of human life, which is characterized not\njust by the circulation of the blood and other features common to\nanimals, but especially by reason, the true virtue and life of the\nmind. (5/5)\n\n\nBut if the aim of the state is peace, and peace consists in the\n\u201charmony of minds\u201d or the rational activity, one might\nwonder how it is that the state could hope to achieve its end in light\nof Spinoza\u2019s skepticism concerning human rationality (1/5; 2/5;\n6/1). How is it that the state can promote the civic virtue or\n\u201cstrength of mind\u201d [fortitudo] on which peace\ndepends (5/2, 5/3)? This is perhaps the central normative question of\nthe TP (see Steinberg 2009; Steinberg 2018a). Spinoza addresses this\nquestion by way of offering institutional recommendations for each\nregime type.\n4.3 Constitutionalism and Model Regimes\n\n\nTo see how Spinoza provides a general response to the question of how\npeace or civic agreement is promoted, we must bear in mind that the\nrelation of agreement comes in degrees (see Blom 1993; Steinberg\n2009). Total agreement, what Blom calls \u201cmaximal\nagreement,\u201d is possible only to the extent that men are fully\nrational (EIVP31\u2013EIVP35). A society of free men would be a perfect\nunion (EIVP67\u201373). However, the free man exists only as an ideal; all\nactual men are imperfectly rational. The concern of the state is to\nbring it about that the actual relationships between people most\nclosely approximate the ideal society of free men. That is, the aim of\nthe state is to make irrational, selfish men as rational and virtuous\nas possible. (For tension between idealist and realist features of\nSpinoza\u2019s political thought, see Armstrong 2009).\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s solution, in broad form, is to adopt constitutional measures\nand institutional procedures that channel the natural passions of men\ntowards the common good. The vision here is one of mechanizing reason\nin much the same way the Venetian Republic is said to have\nmechanized virt\u00f9 (Pocock 1975, 284), a vision much\nindebted to the works of the De la Courts. Civil rationality is the\nproduct of a republican set of institutions that encourage broad\nparticipation, public deliberation, and the adoption of a variety of\naccountability-promoting mechanisms. A rationally organized state will\nnot only promote the common good, in so doing it will also strengthen\nthe civic commitment of its citizens; this is one key way in which the\nstate contributes to the reorientation of the affects of its citizens\nand increases the level of agreement between citizens, the product of\nwhich is harmony or peace (Steinberg 2009; Steinberg 2018a)\n4.3.1 Monarchy\n\n\nGiven that the fundamental aim of the state is peace, the question\nthat Spinoza seeks to address in chapters 6 and 7 of the\nPolitical Treatise is how a monarchy is to be\norganized so as to be maximally peaceful. He begins by repeating the\nclaim that men are largely irrational and selfish. And since the\npassions of common men must be regulated, it is tempting to suppose, as\nHobbes does, that heavy-handed governance is required. But Spinoza\nclaims that even if a despot is able to minimize violence and dissent,\nas the Turkish Sultans were (6/4), this produces only \u201cslavery,\nbarbarism, and desolation,\u201d not the sort of peace or agreement\namong men that is the true end of the state. Indeed, Spinoza claims\nthat the more completely authority is vested in one man the worse off\neveryone is, including the despot himself (6/8). This is because the\nKing is likely to look after his advantage alone, neglecting the\ngeneral welfare, which will ultimately result in the weakening of the\ncivitas. In order to overcome this condition, it is essential\nfor there to be constitutional checks on the behavior of the monarch.\nThese foundational laws are to be understood as the king\u2019s\n\u201cpermanent decrees\u201d [aeterna decreta], expressing\nhis real interests, which are not to be contravened. Spinoza likens\nthese \u201cdecrees\u201d to Ulysses\u2019 order that his oarsmen\nkeep him bound to the mast of his ship even when he is beckoned by the\nSirens\u2019 song (7/1). One of the central constitutional checks is\nthat the King deliberate with, and in some sense answer to, a large\ncouncil composed of citizens (6/15\u201330). Moreover, since the council\nmembers too are likely to be selfish and venal, it is important that\ntheir private interests are bound up with the common good (7/4; cf. 7/27\u201329). As\nMcShea puts it, a properly constituted state will be like a\n\u201chomeostatic mechanism\u201d (1968, 109), correcting divisive or\ndestructive tendencies by ensuring that an individual\u2019s interests\nis always tied to the interests of others. For instance, Spinoza writes\nthat in a properly constituted state:\n\n\nThe king\u2026whether motivated by fear of the people or by his\ndesire to win over the greater part of an armed populace, or whether\nhe is led by nobility of spirit to have regard to the public interest,\nwill always ratify the opinion that is supported by most votes-i.e.,\n(by Section 5 of this Chapter), that is of the greater advantage to\nthe greater part of the state; or else he will try, if possible, to\nreconcile the differing opinions submitted to him so as to gain\npopularity with all (7/11).\n\n\nUltimately, a model monarchy will be a constitutional monarchy that will strongly resemble a democracy. This fits with\nMatheron\u2019s suggestion that, because state power is fundamentally\nbased in the power of the people, those states that deviate least from\na democracy will be most powerful (Matheron 1997). Nevertheless, the\nfact that Spinoza countenanced the possibility that \u201ca people can\npreserve a considerable degree of freedom under a king\u201d (7/31), can be\nseen as a resignation to the reality of Orangism after the events of\n1672 (Blom 2007; Steinberg 2008).\n4.3.2 Aristocracy\n\n\nSpinoza discusses two types of aristocracy and the best forms of\neach. The first is a centralized aristocracy that appears to have been\nmodeled on the Venetian Republic (McShea 1968, 117; Haitsma Mulier\n1980). The second is a decentralized aristocracy, in which sovereignty\nis held by several cities. This type of aristocracy, which Spinoza\ntakes to be superior (9/15), is evidently modeled on the\nUnited Provinces. While Spinoza\u2019s recommendations vary between these\ntwo types of aristocracy, many of the general features remain the\nsame. Spinoza argues, in proto-Madisonian fashion, that the council of\npatricians must be sizable so as to reduce the potential for\nfactionalism (e.g., 8/1; 8/38). He also claims that a large council\nwill protect against selfish or irrational governance (8/6; 9/14). As\nis the case in Spinoza\u2019s discussion of monarchy, the emphasis here is\non finding mechanisms that balance the interests of participants and\nencourage cohesion (e.g., 8/19\u20138/24). One important way in which\ncohesion is encouraged is through the promulgation of the\n\u201cuniversal faith\u201d or civil religion set out in TTP 16\n(8/46).\n\n\nGiven that there will generally be more checks on authority and a\ngreater diffusion of political power in aristocracies than in\nmonarchies, we should not find it surprising that Spinoza claims that\naristocracies are likely to be more absolute than monarchies (8/7),\nsince a state is \u201cabsolute\u201d to the extent that it\nincorporates the rights of all its members and minimizes the basis for\ndissent (8/3, 8/4, 8/7; Steinberg 2018b).  Absoluteness thus indicates a norm very much\nlike peace, the cardinal civil norm; so to say that one regime form is\nmore absolute than another amounts to declaring its superiority.\n\n\nWhile Spinoza clearly indicates that aristocracies are, on the whole\nand in most cases, superior to monarchies, a more interesting and\nsomewhat more vexed question is how aristocracies compare with\ndemocracies. Raia Prokhovnik, for example, has claimed that\naristocracy is \u201cthe form of government [Spinoza] on mature\nreflection prefers\u201d (2004, 210; cf. Feuer 1987 and Melamed 2013). I believe that\nthere are strong reasons for denying that aristocracy displaces\ndemocracy in the TP as Spinoza\u2019s preferred regime. Spinoza does note\nthat the election of patricians as opposed to the birthright\nprivileges of participants in a democracy gives aristocracies an\nadvantage in theory (11/2). However, this advantage is offset by the\nbiased, self-serving practices of most patricians (ibid.). And since\nSpinoza claims that democracy is the most absolute form of regime\n(e.g., 11/1), it would seem that\u2014again, on the whole and in most\ncases\u2014Spinoza favors democracy. Ultimately, though, Spinoza is\nless interested in rank-ordering regimes than he is in determining how\neach regime-type must be organized in order to maximize freedom and\nthe common good.\n4.3.3 Democracy\n\n\nSpinoza had barely begun writing the first of what would likely have\nbeen two chapters on democracy when he died on February 21, 1677. His\nconception of democracy includes any system of popular governance in\nwhich the governing members acquire the right to participate by virtue\nof their civil status rather than by election. This conception of\ndemocracy is broad enough to include even variants of timocracy.\nSpinoza\u2019s own model democracy excludes all those who are not\nsui iuris\u2014e.g., women, servants (servos), and\nforeigners\u2014as well those who do not lead \u201crespectable lives\u201d\n(honesteque vivunt) (11/3). These elitist and exclusionary\naspects of Spinoza\u2019s democracy taint what would otherwise appear to be\na rather progressive form of democracy, from as much as we can glean\nfrom remarks scattered throughout the text.\n\n\nThe general tenor of Spinoza\u2019s democracy is easy to infer from his\ndiscussions of monarchy and aristocracy, both of which include strong\ndemocratic elements. What is particularly interesting is how Spinoza\ndefends these democratic features, since this gives us insight into\nhow democracies are to be defended in general. In the TTP Spinoza seems to\nprovides both principled and instrumental arguments in favor of\ndemocracy. The principled reason is that democracies preserve men\u2019s\nnatural equality (TTP 16, 202) and natural freedom (TTP 5/65). The major\ninstrumental defense of democracy is that \u201cthere is less reason\nin a democratic state to fear absurd proceedings\u201d (16/184). In\nthe TP, Spinoza focuses exclusively on the instrumental defense,\nhighlighting what has recently been called the epistemic advantage of\ndemocracy, i.e., the tendency of popular assemblies to legislate more\nwisely than other legislative bodies (e.g., Cohen, 1986; Estlund 1997;\nSteinberg 2010a; cf. entry on\n democracy. \nFor instance, he repeats his claim that larger councils are more\nlikely to be rational because collective decisions force members to\n\u201chave as their objective what is honourable, or at least appears\nso\u201d (8/6).  He claims that the deliberative features of\nlarge governing bodies improve competency, since \u201cmen\u2019s wits are\ntoo obtuse to get straight to the heart of every question, but by\ndiscussing, listening to others, and debating, their wits are\nsharpened\u201d (9/14). Spinoza also rebuffs those who claim that\nthere is \u201cno truth or judgment in the common people\u201d\n(7/27), claiming that \u201call men share in one and the same\nnature\u201d and that differences in competency stem primarily from\nthe fact that the masses are kept ignorant of the most important\naffairs of the state (ibid.; cf. 7/4). Contrary to Feuer\u2019s suggestion\nthat events such as the murders of the de Witts led to an\nanti-democratic turn in Spinoza\u2019s thought, these passages reveal the\ndepth of Spinoza\u2019s commitment to democracy and his refusal to endorse\nthe thesis that some men are innately more fit to govern than\nothers. So despite the fact that the explicit discussion of democracy\nin the TP was largely preempted by the author\u2019s death, this work\nremains a significant contribution to democratic theory.\n5. The Place of the State in Spinoza\u2019s Ontology\n\n\nIn recent years a lively discussion has emerged in the scholarly\nliterature concerning whether or not Spinoza\u2019s state is an individual\nwith its own conatus. At issue in this debate is whether Spinoza was\nmore of a collectivist or an individualist. The answer to this\nquestion is thought to carry implications for how we conceive of\nSpinoza\u2019s relationship to the liberal tradition. Some of the strongest\nevidence in support of the conception of the state as an individual\ncomes from the so-called physical digression between IIP13 and IIP14,\nwhere Spinoza directly discusses individuality. In this section,\nSpinoza tells us that an individual is a composite body whose parts\n\u201ccommunicate their motion to each other in a certain fixed\nmanner\u201d (II/100, A2, def, A3). The parts of an individual may be\nreplaced, but the individual will persist, provided that the\n\u201csame ratio of motion and rest\u201d is retained (ibid., L5,\nL4). Moreover, individuals who come together to act in a fixed way\nform larger individuals, terminating ultimately in the\nsupreme-individual: the whole of nature (II/101-102, L7). Elsewhere in\nthe Ethics, when remarking on the benefits of human\nassociations, Spinoza claims that \u201cif\u2026two individuals of\nentirely the same nature are joined to one another, they compose an\nindividual twice as powerful as each one\u201d (IVP18S). Here, once\nagain, Spinoza delineates a picture of composite, higher-order\nindividuals, opening up the possibility of viewing the state itself as\nan individual.\n\n\nAlexandre Matheron\u2019s Individu et Communaut\u00e9 chez\nSpinoza contains perhaps the most influential interpretation of\nSpinoza\u2019s account of individuality (1969, esp. Ch. 3). Matheron\nidentifies political societies as individuals, characterized by their\nown \u201cformal element,\u201d i.e., their own unique ratio of\nmotion and rest (see e.g., p. 42, 58).  Following Matheron, Etienne\nBalibar views the state as a highly composite individual, as an\n\u201cindividual of individuals, having a \u2018body\u2019\nand a \u2018soul\u2019 or mind\u201d (1998, 64), a status that he\ncalls elsewhere \u201ctransindividuality\u201d (1997). Others who\nhave espoused this view include Meinecke (1965) and Blom (2007).\n\n\nThis interpretation has been challenged in a number of ways. One\nargument against the view is that in the opening passages of TTP 17\nSpinoza, in contrast to Hobbes, claims that individuals always retain a\n\u201cconsiderable part\u201d of their own natural right; in other\nwords, human beings are never fully integrated into the\nsuper-individual, or state (Den Uyl 1983, 70). The problem with this\nobjection is that there is no reason to suppose that all individuals\nare characterized by complete integration of parts. Matheron, for\ninstance, describes the state as complex individual whose parts are\nonly integrated to a limited degree (1969, 58). Balibar, too, claims\nthat the \u201cautonomy\u201d of individuals is maintained even when\none is a part of a larger collective whole (1997, 21). It is perfectly\nconsistent to recognize the discrete individuality of humans while\nallowing that, under certain conditions of association, individuals can\nsimultaneously be members of larger units. One can be both\na collectivist and an individualist. The real\nanti-individualists are the idealists, who read Spinoza as maintaining\nthat \u201chuman individuality is illusory and untrue\u201d (Joachim\n1901, 130).\n\n\nA second objection to the view that the state is an individual is\nthat, whereas singular things can only be destroyed by external causes\n(IIIP4), \u201ca commonwealth is always in greater danger from its\ncitizens than from its enemies\u201d (e.g., TP 6/6).  If we assume\nthat all individuals are singular things (for a helpful discussion of\nthe relationship between these concepts, see D. Garrett 1994), then\nthe fact that states can ostensibly be destroyed by their parts (i.e.,\ncitizens) would be a sufficient basis for denying that they are\nindividuals (Barbone and Rice 2000, 26\u20137). This is a forceful\nobjection. However, it seems that an analysis of the apparent\nself-destruction of the commonwealth could be provided that parallels\nSpinoza\u2019s attempt to explain how suicide is possible in light of the\nconatus doctrine (EIVP20S). An apparently self-destructive state could\nbe regarded as one that is so affected by \u201chidden external\ncauses,\u201d so overwhelmed by destructive passions, that it takes\non a new nature that is contrary to its original nature (ibid.).\nSpecifically, Spinoza could explain cases of apparent civil\nself-destruction by maintaining that they occur only at the hands of\npoorly-integrated individuals who stand, at least to some degree,\noutside of the body politic. While this form of explanation is not\nwithout problems (see Bennett 1984, \u00a756), it is not obvious that\nthese problems are peculiar to collectivist interpretations of the\nstate.\n\n\nA third challenge to the collectivist interpretation is that if the\nstate is an individual, it should have a mind of its own. But Steven\nBarbone points out that references to the mind of the state are\ntypically preceded by qualifying phrases like veluti\n(\u201cas it were\u201d) and\nquasi (\u201cas if\u201d), indicating that the state has a\nmind only in a metaphorical sort of way (Barbone 2001, pp. 104\u2013105).\nThis objection might be mitigated by arguing that individuality is\nitself a matter of degree and that states are at best\n\u201cloose\u201d individuals (Della Rocca 1996, Ch. 2), with limited\ncohesion or regularity of action. This is consistent with the claim,\nnoted above, that integration into a larger union is itself a matter of\ndegree.\n\n\nUltimately, it seems to me that far less hinges on the success or\nfailure of the collectivist interpretation than has been assumed by\nits opponents. The primary concern expressed by critics like Den Uyl\nand Barbone seems to be that Spinoza not be understood as treating the\nstate as an individual with its own interests that might trump the\ninterests of its constituents. Isaiah Berlin condemned Spinoza along\nwith other positive liberty theorists precisely because he took\nSpinoza to be reifying the state and putting state interests above\nindividual interests (1969). But even if the state is an individual,\nit does not follow that its interests would supersede the interests of\nits citizens. Certainly from the perspective of a citizen, there is no\nreason why one would have to put the interests of the state above\none\u2019s own interests if these two were genuinely to come into to\nconflict. In short, the collectivist can embrace the normative primacy\nof the individual human being. If this is allowed, the matter of\nwhether the state is a literal or merely metaphorical individual seems\nto matter far less than many scholars have supposed.\n6. The Reception and Influence of Spinoza\u2019s Political Philosophy\n\n\nIn is difficult to assess adequately the scope of influence of\nSpinoza\u2019s political thought. Even where Spinoza\u2019s influence\non subsequent political thinkers is direct and indisputable, it is not\nalways easy to tease out the extent to this influence is due to his own\npolitical philosophy, as opposed to his metaphysics. Further\ncomplicating the assessment is the fact that Spinoza and Spinozism\nremained a bugbear throughout Europe for much of the late\n17th and 18th centuries, during which time\nSpinozism was widely associated with atheism. For this reason, even\nsympathetic philosophers often sought to distance their views\nfrom Spinoza\u2019s, positioning themselves as critics or downplaying\nfamiliarity with his texts. Nevertheless, we find traces of the\ninfluence of Spinoza\u2019s political writings throughout the\nEnlightenment, along with an array of hostile responses.\n\n\nThe publication of the unfinished TP in Spinoza\u2019s posthumous\nOpera was met with relative indifference, upstaged as it was\nby the simultaneous appearance of Ethics (Laerke 2010, 122).\nHowever, the TTP was read, discussed, and condemned in the decades\nfollowing its publication. The critical reception tended to focus on\nthe perceived anti-religious features of the work\u2014for instance,\nthe refutation of miracles and the denial of the divine origin of the\nPentateuch\u2014but the naturalistic account of right and law and the\narguments for the freedom to philosophize also provoked debate.\n\n\nJakob Thomasius, Leibniz\u2019s teacher in Leipzig, composed a\nwork, Adversus Anonymum, de Libertate Philosophandi,\ndevoted entirely to the refutation of the TTP and its underlying\nnaturalism. Leibniz too seems to have regarded Spinoza\u2019s views on\nright and law as more dangerous even than Hobbes\u2019, for while Hobbes at\nleast allowed conceptual space for a divine legislator, Spinoza did\nnot (Laerke 2010, 125). Even relatively liberal natural lawyers like Lambert van Velthuysen\n(1622\u20131685) and Samuel Pufendorf (1632\u20131694), regarded\nSpinoza\u2019s treatment of right and obligation as fundamentally\ndestructive. Velthuysen objects that, without a divine legislator,\nthere is \u201cno room left for precepts and commandments\u201d (Ep.\n42) in Spinoza\u2019s philosophy. And Pufendorf maintains that Spinoza\u2019s\nconception of right is defective in that it fails to produce a\n\u201cmoral effect\u201d or to put others under obligations\n(Pufendorf 1934, 391; see Curley 1995).\n\n\nWhile Spinoza\u2019s views on right and law were generally met with\ncontempt, his views on the freedom to philosophize [libertas\nphilosophandi] provoked a more balanced reaction. The doctrine\nhad its critics (see e.g., Israel 2010, 81\u20132), but it also had\nits admirers, perhaps including some of the most prominent early-modern\ntolerationists. Bayle, Locke, and Toland, for instance, were familiar\nwith Spinoza\u2019s defense and likely found some inspiration in it,\neven while they denied deep acquaintance (Locke) or situated themselves\nas critics (Bayle and Toland). Toland\u2019s use in\nPantheisticon of the same epigram from the opening of\nTacitus\u2019 Histories\u2014\u201crare are the happy times\nwhen we may think what we wish and say what we think [rara\ntemporum felicitas ubi sentire quae velis et quae sentias dicere\nlicet]\u201d\u2013 that Spinoza draws from in the title of TTP,\nCh. 20 indicates an affinity between the two thinkers on matters of\nfreedom of speech and thought (for more on the use of this epigram in\nthe 17th and 18th centuries, see Paul Russell\n2010, Ch. 7),\n\n\nLater enlightenment thinkers reprise Spinoza\u2019s claim that\nwhereas the freedoms of thought and expression should be protected, one\nought to obey the sovereign\u2019s decisions on matters of action (TTP\n20, 251\u20132). Echoes of this view may be found in Moses\nMendelssohn\u2019s separation of action and conviction in\nJerusalem (Mendelssohn 1983, 40; Gottlieb 2011, 50), a work\nfor which one scholar maintains that the TTP \u201cserves, if not as\nmodel, at least as decisive subtext\u201d (Goetschel 2004, 168). This\ndivision was even adopted by Frederick the Great, whose policy that men\nmay argue about whatever they wish, provided that they obey is famously\ncelebrated in Kant\u2019s essay \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d\n[Was ist Aufkl\u00e4rung?].\n\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning Spinoza\u2019s influence on the\ndemocratic thought of the French Enlightenment. Jonathan Israel has\nexamined the myriad ways in which Spinoza\u2019s philosophy shaped\negalitarian political thought, including, perhaps most significantly,\nthe political thought of the encyclop\u00e9distes (Israel 2011).\nSpinoza\u2019s influence here is primarily due to his naturalism,\nwhich inspired the materialist metaphysics that underpinned French\ndemocratic thought, rather than to his political arguments. And\nSpinoza\u2019s realist and arguably anti-revolutionary political\nmethod suggests that even if Spinoza\u2019s philosophy influenced\nrevolutionary democratic thought, it may have had little to do with his\nactual political philosophy. (For divergent assessments of\nSpinoza\u2019s attitude towards revolution, see Rosenthal 2013 and\nSharp 2013). Nevertheless, one finds more than a whiff of\nSpinoza\u2019s absolutist conception of democracy in the accounts of the general will\n[volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale] found in\nRousseau (see Ekstein 1944; Williams 2010) and Diderot (Israel\n2011).\n\n\nMore recently, Spinoza\u2019s political philosophy has figured\nprominently in post-1968 leftist French political thought (for a\nsurvey, see van Bunge 2012). However, in the United States, few\npolitical philosophers have seriously engaged Spinoza\u2019s work,\neven while scholarly interest has grown. There is reason to hope,\nhowever, that as Spinoza continues to emerge from Hobbes\u2019 shadow,\npolitical philosophers here may begin to appreciate the rich,\nconsistent, and resourceful arguments contained in his political\nwritings.\n",
