    "main_text": "Scientific inquiry as discovery\n2. Scientific inquiry as discovery\n\nPrior to the 19th century, the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d\nwas used broadly to refer to a new finding, such as a new cure, an\nunknown territory, an improvement of an instrument, or a new method of\nmeasuring longitude. One strand of the discussion about discovery\ndating back to ancient times concerns the method of analysis as the\nmethod of discovery in mathematics and geometry, and, by extension, in\nphilosophy and scientific inquiry. Following the analytic method, we\nseek to find or discover something \u2013 the \u201cthing\nsought,\u201d which could be a theorem, a solution to a geometrical\nproblem, or a cause \u2013 by analyzing it. In the ancient Greek\ncontext, analytic methods in mathematics, geometry, and philosophy\nwere not clearly separated; the notion of finding or discovering\nthings by analysis was relevant in all these fields.\n\nIn the ensuing centuries, several natural and experimental\nphilosophers, including Avicenna and Zabarella, Bacon and Boyle, the\nauthors of the Port-Royal Logic and Newton, and many others,\nexpounded rules of reasoning and methods for arriving at new\nknowledge. The ancient notion of analysis still informed these rules\nand methods. Newton\u2019s famous thirty-first query in the second\nedition of the Opticks outlines the role of analysis in\ndiscovery as follows: \u201cAs in Mathematicks, so in Natural\nPhilosophy, the Investigation of difficult Things by the Method of\nAnalysis, ought ever to precede the Method of Composition. This\nAnalysis consists in making Experiments and Observations, and in\ndrawing general Conclusions from them by Induction, and admitting of\nno Objections against the Conclusions, but such as are taken from\nExperiments, or other certain Truths \u2026 By this way of Analysis\nwe may proceed from Compounds to Ingredients, and from Motions to the\nForces producing them; and in general, from Effects to their Causes,\nand from particular Causes to more general ones, till the Argument end\nin the most general. This is the Method of Analysis\u201d (Newton\n1718, 380, see Koertge 1980, section VI). Early modern accounts of\ndiscovery captured knowledge-seeking practices in the study of living\nand non-living nature, ranging from astronomy and physics to medicine,\nchemistry, and agriculture. These rich accounts of scientific inquiry\nwere often expounded to bolster particular theories about the nature\nof matter and natural forces and were not explicitly labeled\n\u201cmethods of discovery\u201d, yet they are, in fact,\naccounts of knowledge generation and proper scientific reasoning,\ncovering topics such as the role of the senses in knowledge\ngeneration, observation and experimentation, analysis and synthesis,\ninduction and deduction, hypotheses, probability, and certainty. \n\nBacon\u2019s work is a prominent example. His view of the method of\nscience as it is presented in the Novum Organum showed how\nbest to arrive at knowledge about \u201cform natures\u201d (the most\ngeneral properties of matter) via a systematic investigation of\nphenomenal natures. Bacon described how first to collect and organize\nnatural phenomena and experimentally produced facts in tables, how to\nevaluate these lists, and how to refine the initial results with the\nhelp of further trials. Through these steps, the investigator would\narrive at conclusions about the \u201cform nature\u201d that\nproduces particular phenomenal natures. Bacon expounded the procedures\nof constructing and evaluating tables of presences and absences to\nunderpin his matter theory. In addition, in his other writings, such\nas his natural history Sylva Sylvarum or his comprehensive\nwork on human learning De Augmentis Scientiarium, Bacon\nexemplified the \u201cart of discovery\u201d with practical examples\nand discussions of strategies of inquiry.\n\nLike Bacon and Newton, several other early modern authors advanced\nideas about how to generate and secure empirical knowledge, what\ndifficulties may arise in scientific inquiry, and how they could be\novercome. The close connection between theories about matter and force\nand scientific methodologies that we find in early modern works was\ngradually severed. 18th- and early 19th-century\nauthors on scientific method and logic cited early modern approaches\nmostly to model proper scientific practice and reasoning, often\ncreatively modifying them\n (section 3).\n Moreover, they developed the earlier methodologies of\nexperimentation, observation, and reasoning into practical guidelines\nfor discovering new phenomena and devising probable hypotheses about\ncause-effect relations.\n\nIt was common in 20th-century philosophy of science to draw\na sharp contrast between those early theories of scientific method and\nmodern approaches. 20th-century philosophers of science\ninterpreted 17th- and 18th-century approaches as\ngenerative theories of scientific method. They function simultaneously\nas guides for acquiring new knowledge and as assessments of the\nknowledge thus obtained, whereby knowledge that is obtained \u201cin\nthe right way\u201d is considered secure (Laudan 1980; Schaffner\n1993: chapter 2). On this view, scientific methods are taken to have\nprobative force (Nickles 1985). According to modern,\n\u201cconsequentialist\u201d theories, propositions must be\nestablished by comparing their consequences with observed and\nexperimentally produced phenomena (Laudan 1980; Nickles 1985). It was\nfurther argued that, when consequentialist theories were on the rise,\nthe two processes of generation and assessment of an idea or\nhypothesis became distinct, and the view that the merit of a new idea\ndoes not depend on the way in which it was arrived at became widely\naccepted.\n\nMore recent research in history of philosophy of science has shown,\nhowever, that there was no such sharp contrast. Consequentialist ideas\nwere advanced throughout the 18th century, and the early\nmodern generative theories of scientific method and knowledge were\nmore pragmatic than previously assumed. Early modern scholars did not\nassume that this procedure would lead to absolute certainty. One could\nonly obtain moral certainty for the propositions thus secured.\n",
