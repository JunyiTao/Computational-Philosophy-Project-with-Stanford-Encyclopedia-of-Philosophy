    "main_text": "Inductive Versions of the Argument from Evil || Arguments\n3.1 Arguments\n\nIf the argument from evil is given an evidential formulation, what\nform should that take? There appear to be four main possibilities that\nhave been suggested in recent discussions. The first, which might be\ncalled the direct inductive approach, involves the idea that\none can show that theism is unlikely to be true without comparing\ntheism with any alternative hypothesis, other than the mere denial of\ntheism.  At the heart of this first approach, which was set out by\nWilliam Rowe, is the idea that one sound type of inductive inference\nis what might be referred to as instantial generalization, where this\nis a matter of projecting a generalization that has been found to hold\nin all cases that have been so far examined to all cases whatever.\nThe second, which can be labeled the indirect inductive\napproach, argues instead that theism can be shown to be unlikely to be\ntrue by establishing that there is some alternative\nhypothesis\u2014other than the mere negation of theism\u2014that is\nlogically incompatible with theism, and more probable than\ntheism. This approach, which was originally used by David Hume in one\nof his arguments in his Dialogues Concerning Natural\nReligion, and which has been set out and defended in a detailed\nway by Paul Draper, can be viewed as involving an inference to the\nbest explanation, a type of inductive inference that was discovered by\nC. S. Pierce, and which is now very widely accepted.\nThe third approach, which has been advanced by William Rowe,\ninvolves what might be referred to as a Bayesian approach,\nand it differs from the first two approaches in that it does not\ninvolve either instantial generalization or inference to the best\nexplanation, or, indeed, any sort of inductive inference. The idea,\ninstead, is to start out from premises that are themselves substantive\nprobabilistic claims, and then to show that it follows deductively\nfrom those premises, via axioms of probability theory, that it is\nunlikely that God exists.\nThe fourth and final approach, which has been set out by Michael\nTooley, involves the idea of bringing a substantive theory of\ninductive logic, or logical probability, to bear upon the argument\nfrom evil, and then to argue that when this is done, one can derive a\nformula giving the probability that God does not exist relative to\ninformation about the number of apparent evils to be found in the\nworld.\nThese four approaches will be set out and considered in the sections that follow.\n\n",
