    "main_text": "History || The Immediate History\n1.2 The Immediate History\n\nThis section discusses the broader social and intellectual context of\nthe third period indicated above, from which an explicit and nuanced\nphilosophy of liberation would emerge.\n\nAn important part of the origin of the philosophy of liberation as an\nautochthonous philosophical movement was rooted in the question of a\ndistinct or authentic Latin American philosophy. The problem of a\ndistinct Latin American philosophy has been in gestation at least\nsince the late nineteen century, when the so-called \u201cgeneration\nof patriarchs\u201d began to ask about a philosophy or thinking from\nand for the \u201cAmericas\u201d (Beorlegui 2004). This problem took\na distinct shape when Salazar Bondy (1968) re-framed it in terms of\nthe question as to the actual existence of a Latin American\nphilosophy. Using existentialist and Marxist categories, Salazar Bondy\ngave a negative answer. There is no authentic Latin American\nphilosophy because the sub-continent has lived and developed under\nconditions of mental colonialism, intellectual subordination, and\nphilosophical dependence. In order to achieve an authentic Latin\nAmerican philosophy, Salazar Bondy maintained, the sub-continent had\nto achieve its independence and establish its autonomy and\nself-determination. These thoughts, and Zea\u2019s subsequent\nresponse (1969), set the agenda for a generation. The philosophy of\nliberation , so explicitly christened, it could be argued, has gone\nthrough at least the following three stages: constitution and\nmaturation, persecution and exile, challenges and debates (Dussel\n2005; Beorlegui 2004; Cerutti Guldberg 1983 [2006]).\n\nConstitution and Maturation (1969\u20131975). The philosophy\nof liberation was explicitly labeled as such at the Second Argentine\nNational Congress of Philosophy, which was held in Cordoba in 1971\n(Dussel 2017). The inaugurating group was conformed by Osvaldo\nArdiles, Alberto Parisini, Juan Carlos Scannone, Julio de Zan, and\nAnibal Fornari. But this group took a more formal shape at the\njornadas (week long working seminars) of philosophy that were\norganized at the Jesuit University, Universidad of San Salvador (where\nPope Francis was educated), in San Miguel, in the outskirts of Buenos\nAires, Argentina. The first jornada took place in 1971, and a\nsecond was held later the same year with the title \u201cLatin\nAmerican Liberation\u201d. A third jornada was held in 1973,\nat which Salazar Bondy gave a paper titled \u201cFilosof\u00eda de\nla dominacion y filosof\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n (Philosophy\nof Domination and Philosophy of Liberation\u201d (1973), and Leopoldo\nZea gave a paper titled \u201cLa filosof\u00eda latinoamericana\ncomo filosof\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n (Latin American\nPhilosophy as a Philosophy of Liberation)\u201d (1973). This\nstage comes to a close in 1975 with the First Mexican National\nCongress of Philosophy in Morelia, Mexico, with papers by Dussel,\nMir\u00f3 Quesada, Arturo Roig, and Abelardo Villegas. This was an\nimportant meeting because it signaled the launching of the philosophy\nliberation as a Latin American philosophical agenda that supersedes\nits initial Argentine formulations. A new group of philosophers from\nacross Latin America entered into the debate: Hugo Assmann, Carlos\nBaz\u00e1n, Arturo Roig,\n\nIn 1974 the journal Revista de Filosof\u00eda\nLatinoamericana begins to be edited and published in Buenos\nAires, and goes on to become a major publishing venue for philosophers\nof liberation, along with Stromata, published at the\nUniversity of El Salvador, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in which many\nof the inaugural essays and quasi-manifestos of the movement were\npublished.\n\nPersecution and Exile (1975\u20131983). Following the\nmilitary lead coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Mar\u00eda Estela\nMart\u00ednez Per\u00f3n in March of 1976, there began a period\ncalled the \u201cdirty war,\u201d which was in fact a form of\n\u201cstate terrorism,\u201d that included the persecution and\nassassination of philosophers affiliated with the nascent movement of\nthe philosophy of liberation. Due to their persecution, many went into\nexile, moving to Canada, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. One of\nthe consequences of this persecution was that hitherto Argentine\nproject of a Latin American philosophy of liberation was brought to\nother parts of Latin America, making it into a continental project.\nHowever, the Latin American dictatorships of the sixties and the Cold\nWar in general, had directly influenced internal debates about the\n\u201cwho\u201d of Latin American philosophy, and consequently had\npolarizing and decisive effects for how liberation was understood. The\nrole of populism and nationalism in defining the task of philosophy\nbecame a litmus test. In 1980, the AFYL (Asociaci\u00f3n Filosofia y\nLiberaci\u00f3n [Philosophy and Liberation Association]), was\nestablished in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and it become a major vehicle\nfor organizing congresses, round tables, and sessions at international\nphilosophy congresses.\n\nChallenges and Debates (1983 to today). With the transition\nto democracy and the collapse or defeat of the military dictatorships\nin Latin America there began a new stage in the normalization and\nmaturation of liberation philosophy. Horacio Cerutti Guldberg\u2019s\nFilosof\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n latinoamericana\n(Philosophy of Latin American Liberation) (2006) offered the\nmost comprehensive historical and critical reconstruction of the\nmovement. In 1988\u201389, Jorge J.E. Gracia edited a special issue\non \u201cLatin American Philosophy\u201d, with a long essay by\nCerutti Guldberg in which a synoptic overview of the movement is\npresented. In 1993, Ofelia Schutte published her Cultural Identity\nand Social Liberation in Latin American Thought in which a\ncritical confrontation with some key theses of liberation philosophy\nis developed. These substantive texts signaled the maturity and\ngeneral coherence of the philosophy of liberation, at the very least\nas it was perceived by its critics. These works called for\nre-articulations and reformulations that made explicit the inner\ntensions and divisions within the group of thinkers that had first\ngiven voice to this new current and method of doing philosophy in\nLatin America.\n\nThese differences and divergences have become increasingly pronounced.\nIt may now no longer be possible to speak of a \u201cphilosophy of\nliberation\u201d, in the singular. Instead, it may be more\nappropriate to speak of \u201cphilosophies of\nliberation\u201d, in the plural, where what is shared is a set of\noverlapping themes among the distinct accounts of what are the\nsituations and conditions from which liberation is to be sought, and\ndifferent philosophical methods and traditions used to articulate\nthose accounts . To be sure, there remains a substantive core that\nholds together the constellation of the philosophy of liberation now\nin the middle of its fourth decade of existence. Widely shared\ncharacteristics of the various philosophies of liberation include the\nfollowing:\n\nAn indisputable point of departure for all philosophers liberation\nis the consciousness of the economic, social, political and cultural\ndependence of Latin America on Europe and the United States.\nThe general affirmation that \u201cphilosophy\u201d has to be\npracticed from a specific context of both engagement and commitment\nwithin the distinct Latin American historical and geopolitical\nsituation. The claim is that implicitly or explicitly all\nphilosophizing is always a form of commitment with an existential\nsituation. All philosophers of liberation share the conviction that a\nphilosophy that is worthy of that name is a tool or means of\nenlightenment, a theoretical elaboration at the service of a\npraxis of liberation. The philosophy of liberation is the\ntwin of a practice of emancipation.\nAll philosophizing is done out of a concrete historical situation.\nYet, this \u201cconcrete historical\u201d situation has received\ndifferent formulations, which define the different currents within the\nphilosophy of liberation (see\n section 3,\n below). For now, we can note that the \u201cpoint of\ndeparture\u201d can be a people, nation, or autochthonous culture; it\ncan refer to a class or economic group understood along Marxist lines;\nit can include a cultural, historical, existential project that\nmanifests itself in terms of a historical formation or agent.\nAs a critique of putatively colonized thinking and dependent\nphilosophy, the philosophy of liberation is a metaphilosophy. For this\nreason, issues of method are integral to its philosophical agenda. In\ntandem with the different \u201cpoints of departure\u201d for\nphilosophy that is authentically grounded, different liberation\nphilosophers argue on behalf of the virtues of one or another\nphilosophical method or current. Thus, we find some philosophers of\nliberation who are \u201cindigenistas\u201d, some who at one time or\nanother were Ricoeuerian, Heideggerian, Levinasian; others who were\nDiltheyan, Gadamerian, and Gaosian and/or Ortegian, and some who were\nMarxists. The philosophy of liberation, which is critical of European\nphilosophy, is so from within, immanently, even when some of its\nrepresentatives argue from some \u201canalectical\u201d standpoint,\nor standpoint of metaphysical \u201cexteriority\u201d to imperial\nand totalizing thought. It is thus not surprising that philosophy\n\u201ccompanions\u201d or handbooks to Existentialism,\nPhenomenology, Marxism, or to figures such as Martin Heidegger, Karl\nMarx, Emmanuel Levinas, include entries on \u201cphilosophy of\nliberation\u201d, or some of its most representative figures.\nInasmuch at it is defined by the word \u201cliberation\u201d,\nall philosophy of liberation is entangled with the project of\nsketching an utopia and identifying the \u201csubject\u201d of the\nconstruction of such an utopia. The utopia of liberation entails\neither recognizing the suppressed historical subject, or forging a new\none. This liberation or emancipating subject could\nbe\u00a0\u201cel pueblo\u201d, or the proletarian class, or\nthe popular sectors, made up by the \u201cpueblo\u201d now\nunderstood as the destitute and exploited of the nation. For others,\nas we will see, this subject is constituted by the nation as it is\nembodied in its popular sector. That sector is not understood simply\nin terms of class or even cultural identity, but in terms of an\nanti-colonial attitude aimed at national sovereignty.\n\n\nThese general and shared characteristics, problems and themes could be\nsummarized in three observations about the coherence and unity of the\nphilosophy of liberation.. First, there is a general agreement that\nLatin American philosophy must be a philosophy of liberation that aims\nat overcoming dependence, domination and subordination. Second, there\nis ample disagreement as to the who, what, or how, is this project of\nliberation to be undertaken. Third, there is also ample disagreement\nas to the \u201ccontent\u201d or final goal of liberation. In short,\nthe philosophy of liberation is defined by what many would argue is\nintegral to all philosophy as such, namely questioning the general\nindividual existential situation of alienation, the corresponding\nproject of liberation, and what the utopia of achieved liberation\ncould and would look like. Philosophers of liberation argue,\nnevertheless, that this questioning takes on a universal character\nonly and precisely because it is taken up from within a specific and\nunique existential, historical, and geo-political situation.\n",
