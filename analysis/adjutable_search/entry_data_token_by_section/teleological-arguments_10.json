Conclusion\n\nPerception and appreciation of the incredible intricacy and the beauty\nof things in nature\u2014whether biological or cosmic\u2014has\ncertainly inclined many toward thoughts of purpose and design in\nnature, and has constituted important moments of affirmation for those\nwho already accept design positions. Regardless of what one thinks of\nthe arguments at this point, so long as nature has the power to move\nus (as even Kant admitted that the \u2018starry heavens above\u2019\ndid), design convictions and arguments are unlikely to disappear\nquietly.\n",
