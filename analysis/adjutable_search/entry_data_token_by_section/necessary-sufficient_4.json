    "main_text": "Inferences, Reasons for Thinking, and Reasons Why\n5. Conclusion\n\nGiven the different roles for \u201cif\u201d just identified, it is\nhardly surprising that generalisations about necessary and/or\nsufficient conditions are hard to formulate. Suppose, for example,\nsomeone tries to state a sufficient condition for a seminar being good\nin a context where the speaker and all the listeners share the view\nthat Solange\u2019s presence is a reason why seminars would be good.\nIn this case, Solange\u2019s presence might be said to be a\nsufficient condition of the seminar being good in the sense that her\npresence is a reason why it is good. Now, is there a similar sense in\nwhich the goodness of the seminar is a necessary condition of\nSolange\u2019s presence? The negative answer to this question is\nalready evident from the earlier discussion. If we follow von\nWright\u2019s proposal, mentioned above, we get the following result:\nthat the seminar is not good is a sufficient condition of Solange not\nbeing present. But this cannot plausibly be read as a sufficient\ncondition in anything like the sense of a reason why. At most, the\nfact of the seminar not being a good one may be a reason for thinking\nthat Solange was not at it. So how can we tell, in general, what kind\nof condition is being expressed in an \u201cif\u201d sentence? As\nnoted in the case of the sea battle, when rewriting in the formal mode\ncaptures the sense of what is being said, and when the formulations\n\u201cif p, q\u201d and \u201cp only if\nq\u201d seem idiomatically equivalent, then an inferential\ninterpretation will be in order, von Wright\u2019s equivalences will\nhold, and the material conditional gives a reasonable account of such\ncases. As indicated above, there are limitations to such an approach\nand it provides at best a partial account of the circumstances under\nwhich conditional sentences express necessary or sufficient\nconditions.\n\nAs already noted, even the inferential use of \u201cif\u201d is not\nalways associated primarily with the business of stating necessary and\nsufficient conditions. This observation, together with the cases and\ndistinctions mentioned in the present article, shows the need for\ncaution when we move from natural language conditionals to analysis of\nthem in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, and also the\nneed for caution in modelling the latter conditions by means of formal\noperators. It appears that there are several kinds of conditionals,\nand correspondingly several kinds of conditions. As the developments\noutlined above have shown, there are as a result several formal\nschemes for translating and making sense of the variety of\nconditionals used in natural language and the conditions, if any, that\nthey express.\n",
