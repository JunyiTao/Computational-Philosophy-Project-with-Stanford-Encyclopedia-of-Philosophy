They initially went to Italy, where Louis (Ludwig) of\nBavaria, the Holy Roman Emperor, was in Pisa at the time, along with\nhis court and retinue. The Holy Roman Emperor was engaged in a\npolitical dispute with the Papacy, and Ockham\u2019s group found\nrefuge under his protection. On June 6, 1328, Ockham was officially\nexcommunicated for leaving Avignon without\n permission.[6]\n Around 1329, Louis returned to Munich, together with Michael, Ockham\nand the rest of their fugitive band. Ockham stayed there, or at any\nrate in areas under Imperial control, until his death. During this\ntime, Ockham wrote exclusively on political\n matters.[7]\n He died on the night of April 9/10, 1347, at roughly the age of\n sixty.[8]\n",
