    "main_text": "\n\n\nCategory theory has come to occupy a central position in contemporary\nmathematics and theoretical computer science, and is also applied to\nmathematical physics. Roughly, it is a general mathematical theory of\nstructures and of systems of structures. As category theory is still\nevolving, its functions are correspondingly developing, expanding and\nmultiplying. At minimum, it is a powerful language, or conceptual\nframework, allowing us to see the universal components of a family of\nstructures of a given kind, and how structures of different kinds are\ninterrelated. Category theory is both an interesting object of\nphilosophical study, and a potentially powerful formal tool for\nphilosophical investigations of concepts such as space, system, and\neven truth. It can be applied to the study of logical systems in which\ncase category theory is called \u201ccategorical doctrines\u201d at\nthe syntactic, proof-theoretic, and semantic levels. Category theory\neven leads to a different theoretical conception of set and, as such,\nto a possible alternative to the standard set theoretical foundation\nfor mathematics. As such, it raises many issues about mathematical\nontology and epistemology. Category theory thus affords philosophers\nand logicians much to use and reflect upon.\n\n",
