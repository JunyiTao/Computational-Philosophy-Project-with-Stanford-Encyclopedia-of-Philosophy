    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Essence and Existence\n4.1 Essence and Existence\n\nSuhraward\u2019s concept of light manages to \u2018disrupt\u2019\nthe classical Peripatetic ontology by rendering obsolete the Avicennan\ndistinction between \u2018essence\u2019 and \u2018existence\u2019\nin contingent beings (Rizvi 2000). Perhaps following Aristotle,\nAvicenna favored the primacy of essence over existence, the latter\nbeing considered an abstract concept. Suhrawardi criticized and\nrejected the Peripatetic logical distinction between the two concepts,\ninsisting that the concept of existence is added to quiddity in\nre, such that the general extension of the concept of existence\nremains a mental predicate, not a real one. Concepts such as being,\nthingness, etc. that Peripatetics considered a priori and\nreal are, for Suhrawardi, \u2018beings of reason\u2019\n(i\u2018tibar \u2018aqli), i.e. \u201cmerely mental\nconsiderations (i\u2018tibari) with no corresponding\nreality\u201d (Rizvi 1999, 222; PI, \u00a768, 56; Suh.\n1993a, 175\u20136). This is what some have labeled Suhrawardi\u2019s\n\u2018conceptualist\u2019 position, essence and existence being\ndistinct only in the mind, and his \u2018anti-realist\u2019 approach\nto existence, a notion predicated only of concepts in the mind\n(Benevich 2017, 206, 251), a possible later Nasir al-Din al-Tusi\ninspired reading. \n\nThe primacy of light signals a shift in the understanding of the very\nnature of the \u2018essence\u2019 of things. The respective degree\nor intensity of light of essences makes them distinct from one\nanother, although they all share in the same light whose origin\nremains with the Light of Lights. Everything partakes in and\nof light, in an almost infinite manner. The distinction\nbetween essence and existence no longer becomes appropriate to assert\ncontingency and only remains notional, since the difference between\nnecessary and contingent beings depends now on whether a being\npossesses light in itself or light for other than\nitself (Rizvi 1999, 223; PI, \u00a768). In the\nPhilosophy of Illumination (\u00a7121), Suhrawardi writes,\n\u201cLight is divided into light of itself and in itself and light\nof itself but in another. You know that accidental light is light in\nanother. Thus, it is not a light in itself although it is a\nlight of itself\u201d. \n\nRizvi (1999, 224) showed how later philosophers ascribed the\nontological primacy of essence (or quiddity) thesis to Suhrawardi who\n\u201cclearly states that quiddity/essence in itself is a conceptual\nand unreal a notion as existence\u201d, Suhrawardi noting that\n\u201cthe quiddity of luminosity [i.e., the same as light] is a\nmental universal\u201d (PI, \u00a7141). But it is also true\nthat Suhrawardi\u2019s \u201cphenomenological epistemology of\neidetic vision\u201d could easily imply a primacy of essence\n(Rizvi 1999, 224). The position is eminently nominalist, now that both\nexistence and essence are considered mere mental concepts, reality\nhaving been redefined with the new primacy of light. Likewise, his\ntheory of knowledge by presence remains \u201cdeeply nominalist and\nempiricist\u201d (viz. mystical experience) (Walbridge 2000, 169).\nHowever, light and essence cannot be synonymous. Both light and\ndarkness exist: \u201clight is the being of things as their\ninstantiating principle in concreto and not their\nessences\u201d (ibid.). Likewise, light is not identical\nwith substance, since both dark substances and accidental lights exist\n(Walbridge 2000, 24). Rizvi (1999, 224) notes that entities grasped as\nessences through presential knowledge are \u201capparent aspects of\nwhat one might regard as \u2018light monads\u2019\u201d, an idea\nwhose source appears to be highly Platonic or Neoplatonic (Proclus).\n\n\nFor Suhrawardi (PI, \u00a7\u00a7111\u20133), being is\ngrasped through the (non-sensible) vision of lights that lie beyond\nthe essences, as even the existence of bodies depends upon incorporeal\nlights: \u201cNothing that has an essence (dhat) of which it\nis not unconscious is dusky, for its essence is evident\n(zuhur) to it. It cannot be a dark state (hay\u2019a\nzulmaniyya) in something else, since even the luminous state\n(hay\u2019a nuriyya) is not a self-subsistent light (nur\nli-dhati-ha), let alone the dark state. Therefore, it is\nnonspatial pure incorporeal (nur mahd) light\u201d\n(PI, \u00a7114). Access to this ultimate reality of beings is\nachieved through the direct experience of its ontic light reality,\nrendering intuitive and non-discursive knowledge (logically) prior to\nany other type of knowledge. \n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s criticism of the essence-existence distinction had\nan impact on later discussions, namely those of Ibn Kammuna (d.1284)\n(Eichner 2010), Athir al-Din al-Abhari (d.ca.1265) and al-Katibi\nal-Qazwini (d.ca.1276) (Eichner 2012). Later, Mulla Sadra (d.1636)\nnotes Suhrawardi\u2019s confusion between the concept of existence\nand the reality of existence and replaces his notion of light with the\nnotion of being, blending Avicenna\u2019s ontology of contingency\nwith his ishraqi hierarchy of lights (Rizvi 1999, 225). \n",
