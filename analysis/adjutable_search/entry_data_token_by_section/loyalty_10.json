Justifying loyalty\n\nThere is a great deal of contingency to the development of loyalties.\nThe loyalties we develop to family, tribe, country, and religion often\nemerge almost naturally as we become increasingly aware of the social\nrelations that have formed us. Our identifications can be very deep\nand are often unquestioning. For some writers, this unchosenness is\nwhat distinguishes loyalty from other commitments such as fidelity\n(Allen, 1989). But loyalty also extends to consciously acquired\nrelational commitments, as we choose to associate with particular\npeople, groups, and institutions. Whether those latter loyalties\ndevelop depends on the extent to which the associations we choose to\nbe involved in acquire some intrinsic significance for us beyond any\ninstrumental value that may have first attracted us to them. Such\nexplanatory accounts, however, do not justify the loyalties we form or\nmay be inclined to form. Yet, because loyalties privilege their\nobjects, the provision of a justification is important.\n\nFor some writers, the distinction between chosen and unchosen\nloyalties is critical. Simon Keller, for example, considers that our\ngeneral unwillingness to question unchosen loyalties exhibits the lack\nof integrity often referred to as bad faith. Once we have such\nloyalties\u2014he focuses on patriotic loyalties\u2014we are\nresistant to their scrutiny and self-defensively discount challenges\nto them (Keller, 2005; 2007). There may be some truth to the view that\nwe are more likely to show bad faith as far as our unchosen loyalties\nare concerned, but it may be difficult to offer that as a general\ncomment on unchosen loyalties. There may be no more reason not to call\nour patriotism into question when we see how our country is behaving\nthan there is not to call a friendship into question when we see how\nour friend is behaving. It may be psychologically harder (and a moral\nhazard associated with loyalties) to challenge unchosen loyalties, but\nthat does not sustain a general judgment about them.\n\nSome have treated arguments for associational loyalty as though they\nwere cut from the same cloth as general arguments for associational\nobligations. They have, therefore, embedded claims for loyalty in\n\u201cfair-play\u201d or\n\u201cnatural-duty-to-support-just-institutions\u201d arguments for\nassociational obligations. But whatever the merits of such arguments\nas grounds for general institutional obligations, they do not provide\ngrounds for the particularistic obligations that we connect with\nloyalty. They do not capture the particularity of such obligations.\nEven consent-based arguments are insufficiently particularistic.\nLeaving aside the possibility that our basic political or parental or\nother associational obligations may also include an obligation to be\nloyal, we can usually fulfill what we take those obligations to be\nwithout any sense of loyalty to their objects. Obligations of loyalty\npresuppose an associational identification that more general\ninstitutional or membership obligations do not.\n\nOf the various instrumental justifications of loyalty, the most\ncredible is probably that developed by A.O. Hirschman (1970; 1974).\nHirschman assumes, along with many other institutional theorists, that\nvalued social relationships and institutions have an endemic tendency\nto decline. He claims, however, that social life would be seriously\nimpoverished were we self-advantageously to transfer or relinquish our\nassociational affiliations whenever a particular social institution\nfailed to deliver the goods associated with our connection to it, or\nwhenever a more successful provider of that good came along. On this\naccount, loyalty can be seen as a mechanism whereby we (at least\ntemporarily) persist in our association with the institution (or\naffiliation) while efforts are made (through giving voice) to bring it\nback on track. Loyalty commits us to securing or restoring the\nproductivity of socially valued institutions or affiliations. To the\nextent, then, that an institution or affiliation provides highly\ndesired or needed goods for people, they have reason to be loyal to it\nand, ceteris paribus, their loyalty should be given to the point at\nwhich it becomes clear that the institution is no longer capable of\nbeing recuperated or that one\u2019s loyal efforts will be in\nvain.\n\nBut as valuable as loyalty may be for associational recuperation, it\nis not clear that we can link its justification only to its\nrecuperative potential. For even within a generally consequentialist\nframework loyalty may play a more positive role. The loyal alumnus who\ndonates $100 million to an already healthy endowment fund is\ncontributing to institutional advancement rather than stemming\ninstitutional decline. In such a case the loyalty expresses a desire\nto further institutional interests rather than restore or even\npreserve them. The donation is seen as an expression of loyalty\nbecause it expresses a commitment to the institution in the face of\nthe alternatives available to the donor. An outside philanthropist\nmight, however, choose to donate the same amount, albeit not out of\nloyalty to the institution.\n\nMore critically, if loyalty is viewed simply in terms of the goods\nthat the associative object is able to secure or produce, the\nintrinsic value that the association has come to have for the loyal\nperson is overlooked, along with the sense of identification that it\nexpresses. It is out of that sense of identification that loyalty\narises.\n\nAn alternative account is that loyalty is owed to various associations\nas a debt of gratitude. Although gratitude as a ground of obligation\nalso stands in need of justification (McConnell, 1983), it tends to be\nmore widely acceptable as a justifying reason than loyalty. The fact\nthat we are the nonvoluntary beneficiaries of some of the associative\nrelations to which we are said to owe some of our primary\nloyalties\u2014say, familial, ethnic, or political\u2014has provided\nsome writers with a reason to think that gratitude grounds such\nloyalties (cf. Walker, 1988; Jecker, 1989).\n\nBut obligations of gratitude are not ipso facto obligations of\nloyalty: the brutalized Jew who was rescued by the Good Samaritan may\nhave had a debt of gratitude but he had no debt of loyalty (Luke\n10:25\u201337). Loyalty, moreover, may be owed where there is no\nreason for gratitude: as may be the case between friends. Obligations\nof gratitude are recompensive, whereas obligations of loyalty sustain\nassociations.\n\nThere may be a deeper reason for thinking that\u2014in some\nassociative relations\u2014loyalty ought to be fostered and shown. It\nresides in the conception of ourselves as social beings. We do not\ndevelop into the persons we are and aspire to be in the same fashion\nas a tree develops from a seedling into its mature form. Our genetic\nsubstratum is not as determinative of our final form as a\ntree\u2019s. Nor do we (generally) flourish as the persons we become\nand aspire to remain in the manner of a tree. We are social creatures\nwho are what we are because of our embeddedness in and ongoing\ninvolvement with relations and groups and communities of various\nkinds. Though these evolve over time, such social affiliations (or at\nleast some of them) become part of who we are; and, moreover, our\nassociation with such individuals, groups, and communities (though\noften instrumentally valued) becomes part of what we conceive a good\nlife to be for us. Our loyal obligation to them arises out of the\nvalue that our association with them has for us.\n\nA broad justification such as this leaves unstated what associations\nmight be constitutive of human flourishing. Perhaps there is no\ndefinitive list. But most would include friendships, familial\nrelationships, and some of the social institutions that foster,\nsustain, and secure the social life in which we engage as part of our\nflourishing. To the extent that we accept that engagement with or in a\nparticular form of association or relation is constitutive of our\nflourishing, to that extent we will consider loyalty to it to be\njustified\u2014even required.\n\nThe arguments that justify loyalty do not ipso facto justify unlimited\nsacrifice in the name of loyalty, though they do not rule out the\npossibility that, for example, a person might legitimately be willing,\nas an expression of loyalty, to lay down his life for another. That is\noften the case in wartime and may also be true of some friendships.\nThe strength of the claims of loyalty will depend on the importance of\nthe association to the person who has the association and, of course,\non the legitimacy of the association in question. Not only may some\nassociative relations be illegitimate, but the expectations of one\nassociation may come into conflict with those of another: we may have\nconflicts of loyalty. If the conflict is resolved by giving one\nloyalty precedence over another, it does not necessarily follow that\nloyalty to the one is disloyalty to the other. It is no disloyalty to\na friend who is counting on me if instead I attend to my dying\nmother\u2019s needs. Sometimes such priorities will be\nstraightforward, at other times not. Prioritization may, nevertheless,\ncall for an apology and compensation in respect of the disappointed\nparty. Even if we decide unwisely, our decision will not ipso facto\ncount as disloyalty. Disloyalty is more often associated with the\nself-serving or hypocritical abandonment of loyalty.\n",
