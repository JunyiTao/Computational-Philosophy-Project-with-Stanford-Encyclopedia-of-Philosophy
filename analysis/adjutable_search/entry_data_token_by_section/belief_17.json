    "main_text": "The Content of Beliefs || Frege\u2019s Puzzle\n3.5 Frege\u2019s Puzzle\n\nRecall that in the de dicto sense (see \u00a73.3 above) it\nseemed plausible to say that Lois Lane, who does not know that Clark\nKent is Superman, believes that Superman is strong but does not\nbelieve that Clark Kent is strong. Despite the intuitive appeal of\nthis view, some widely accepted \u201cRussellian\u201d views in the\nphilosophy of language appear committed to attributing to Lois exactly\nthe same beliefs about Clark Kent as she has about Superman. On such\nviews, the semantic content of a name, or the contribution it makes to\nthe meaning or truth conditions of a sentence, depends only on the\nindividual picked out by that name. Since the names\n\u201cSuperman\u201d and \u201cClark Kent\u201d pick out the same\nindividual, it follows that the sentence \u201cLois believes Superman\nis strong\u201d could not have a different meaning or truth value\nfrom the sentence \u201cLois believes Clark Kent is strong\u201d.\nPhilosophers of language have discussed this issue, known as\n\u201cFrege\u2019s Puzzle\u201d, extensively since the 1970s.\nAlthough the issues here arise for all the propositional attitudes (at\nleast), generally the puzzle is framed and discussed in terms of\nbelief. See the entry on\n propositional attitude reports.\n",
