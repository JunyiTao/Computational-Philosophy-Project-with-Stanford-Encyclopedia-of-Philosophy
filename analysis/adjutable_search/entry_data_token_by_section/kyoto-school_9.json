    "main_text": "Absolute Nothingness: Giving Philosophical Form to the Formless || Nishitani\u2019s Three-field Topology: Being, Nihility, and Emptiness\n3.5 Nishitani\u2019s Three-field Topology: Being, Nihility, and Emptiness\n\nIn the tradition of the Kyoto School, Tanabe\u2019s role has often\nbeen seen, justly or unjustly, as more of a dialectical counterpoint\nthan an independent alternative to Nishida. Following the lead of\nNishida\u2019s own creative appropriation of Tanabe\u2019s critique\nof his middle-period philosophy of place, many subsequent Kyoto School\nfigures have tended to incorporate Tanabe\u2019s dialectical thinking\ninto, rather than seeing it as a replacement for, Nishida\u2019s\ntopological thinking of absolute nothingness. To be sure, such\nthinkers as Takeuchi Yoshinori and Hase Sh\u014dt\u014d were\nprofoundly influenced by Tanabe who, inspired by Shin Buddhism,\nunderstands absolute nothingness in terms of the absolute mediation of\nOther-power. Yet many others received their primary impetus from\nNishida and from Zen. Although Nishida\u2019s conception of a kenotic\nand dialectical self-determination of the place of absolute\nnothingness was inspired by Shin Buddhism and Christianity as well as\nZen Buddhism, later Kyoto philosophers such as Nishitani, Abe, and\nUeda relates their thought primarily to Zen even as they also\ncontinued to engage in dialogue with Shin Buddhism and Christian\ntheology and mysticism.\n\nTanabe\u2019s method of thinking, as we have seen, was intensely\ndialectical, a method he developed through his prolonged study of\nHegel. Nishitani, on the other hand, began his study of Western\nthought by focusing on Bergson, Schelling, Nietzsche and the German\nmystics. Between 1937 and 1939 Nishitani studied with Heidegger, who\nwas at the time beginning to grapple with the question of nihilism,\nand whose phenomenology had developed into a thinking of the\n\u201cclearing of being\u201d or what he would later characterize as\na \u201ctopology of being\u201d (Heidegger 1975, Vol. 15, 335).\nInfluenced no doubt in part by his contact with Heidegger (and\nevidently in turn influencing Heidegger, who frequently invited him to\nhis house to learn about Zen), Nishitani developed, in his own highly\noriginal manner, existential and phenomenological aspects of\nNishida\u2019s topology of absolute nothingness.\n\nThe problem of nihilism gradually became a major focus of\nNishitani\u2019s personal and scholarly attention. Nishitani\nunderstood the historical phenomenon of nihilism as a vacuous\nnothingness that assaults the modern world, a world bereft of its\nethical and religious moorings. Despite Nishitani\u2019s appreciation\nof the profundity of his mentor Nishida\u2019s philosophy, he thought\nit failed to adequately address this crucial modern problem (see Ueda\n2011a). According to Nishitani, Nishida\u2019s philosophy, whether it\nbe his early thought of \u201cpure experience\u201d or his later\nnotion of \u201caction-intuition,\u201d begins already from a\nstandpoint where the dualistic consciousness of the ego has already\nbeen broken though (see NKC IX 247\u201348; Nishitani 1991,\n184\u201385). For his part, Nishitani was concerned with the question\nof how to think the topological pathway leading to such a breakthrough\nto non-duality.\n\nThe question of how to open up an existential path to the place of\nabsolute nothingness was particularly acute given the prevalence of\nthe pendulum swing between two extremes endemic to modernity: on the\none hand, an extreme reification of the subjective ego together with a\ncorresponding objectification and technological manipulation of\nthings; and, on the other hand, a reactive nihilism which threatens to\nnullify the very reality of both the self and things. For Nishitani,\nhumanism and science were incapable of overcoming this dilemma of\nreification vs. nullification; in fact, they had helped create it. In\nan age of secular egoism and anti-religious nihilism, how could an\nexperience of the place of absolute nothingness take place?\n\nTo begin with, Nishitani says we must heed the call of\nNietzsche\u2019s madman and cease fleeing from the experience of\nnihilism. God as the highest being is dead, and it remains an open\nquestion whether he can be reborn as absolute nothingness. In any\ncase, the venture of Nishitani\u2019s philosophy of Zen is more\nconcerned with the existential imperative of letting go of attachments\nthan it is with immediately grasping hold of a new concept for God. In\norder to finally free humans from their egoistic obsessions and\nmanipulative objectifications in the dualistic \u201cfield of\n[reified] being and [dualistic] consciousness,\u201d Nishitani argued\nfor the necessity of first boldly stepping back into the \u201cfield\nof nihility.\u201d\n\nYet the real breakthrough to a non-dualistic reaffirmation of self and\nworld only occurs when the relative nothingness of nihility is in turn\nbroken through to a genuine experience of absolute nothingness or true\nemptiness on the \u201cfield of emptiness.\u201d Nishitani thus\nexplained the personal encounter with nihilism as an experience of the\nextreme relative nothingness of \u201cnihility\u201d or\n\u201cvacuous nothingness\u201d (kyomu), and for him the\ncentral task of \u201covercoming nihilism by way of passing through\nnihilism\u201d entailed transgressing beneath (i.e.,\n\u201ctrans-descending\u201d) the \u201cfield of nihility\u201d to\nthe \u201cfield of emptiness\u201d (see NKC X, 109 and 122ff.;\nNishitani 1986, 97 and\n 108ff.).[15]\n As mentioned earlier (subsection 3.2), the \u201cfield of\nemptiness\u201d is not a vacuum of relative nothingness that assaults\nbeings from without; it is an open clearing wherein beings are neither\nnullified nor reified but rather let be in the mutual freedom of their\ncoming to be and passing away in unobstructed interrelation with one\nanother. It is also the place in which a genuine interpersonal\nencounter can take place (Nishitani 2004; Davis 2017).\n\nWhile Nishitani\u2019s \u201cfield of emptiness\u201d (k\u016b\nno ba) corresponds in many respects to what Nishida\ncalls the \u201cplace of absolute nothingness\u201d (zettai-mu\nno basho), Nishitani takes the peculiar problems that beset the\nmodern secular and technological world, as well as postmodern\ncritiques of metaphysics and subjectivity (especially those of\nNietzsche and Heidegger), far more seriously than did Nishida.\nNishitani also connects his thought much more explicitly with the\ntradition of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism than did Nishida, writing on,\nand writing from, what he calls the \u201cstandpoint of Zen\u201d\n(see NKC XI; and Nishitani 2009).\n",
