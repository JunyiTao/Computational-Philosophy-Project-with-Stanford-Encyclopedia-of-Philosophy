Experimentally trained psycholinguists\nadvocate using and adapting various experimental methods that have\nbeen developed in the cognitive and behavioral sciences to collect\nacceptability judgments. And while the debate is often cast in terms\nof which method is absolutely better, a more appropriate question\nmight be when one method is to be preferred to the others. Those\ninclined toward less experimentally controlled methods point out that\nthere are many clear and uncontroversial acceptability judgments that\ndo not need to be shown to be reliable. Advocates of experimental\nmethods point out that many purportedly clear, uncontroversial\njudgments have turned out to be unreliable, and led to false empirical\ngeneralizations about languages. Both seem to be right in different\ncases.\n\nChomsky has frequently stated his view that the experimental\ndata-gathering techniques developed in the behavioral sciences are\nneither used nor needed in linguistic theorizing. For example:\n\nThe gathering of data is informal; there has been little use of\nexperimental approaches (outside of phonetics) or of complex\ntechniques of data collection and data analysis of a sort that can\neasily be devised, and that are widely used in the behavioral\nsciences. The arguments in favor of this informal procedure seem to me\nquite compelling; basically, they turn on the realization that for the\ntheoretical problems that seem most critical today, it is not at all\ndifficult to obtain a mass of crucial data without use of such\ntechniques. Consequently, linguistic work, at what I believe to be its\nbest, lacks many of the features of the behavioral sciences. (Chomsky\n1969: 56)\n\n\nHe also expressed the opinion that using experimental behavioral data\ncollection methods in linguistics \u201cwould be a waste of time and\nenergy\u201d (1969: 81).\n\nAlthough many Emergentists\u2014the intellectual heirs of\nSapir\u2014would accept \u2018ask-the-informant\u2019 data, we\nmight expect them to tend to accept experimental data-gathering\nmethods that have been developed in the social sciences. There is\nlittle doubt that strict followers of the methodology preferred by\nBloomfield in his later career would disapprove of \u2018ask the\ninformant\u2019 methods. Charles Hockett remarked:\n\nA language, as a set of habits, is a fragile thing, subject to minor\nmodification in the slightest breeze of circumstance; this, indeed, is\nits great source of power. But this is also why the\ntransformationalists (like the rest of us!), using themselves as\ninformants, have such a hard time deciding whether certain candidates\nfor sentencehood are really \u2018in their dialect\u2019 or not; and\nit is why Bloomfield, in his field work, would never elicit paradigms,\nfor fear he would induce his informant to say something under the\nartificial conditions of talking with an outsider that he would never\nhave said in his own everyday surroundings. (Hockett 1968:\n89\u201390, fn. 31)\n\n\nWe might expect Bloomfield, having abandoned his earlier Wundtian\npsychological leanings, to be suspicious of any method that could be\ncast as introspective. And we might expect many contemporary\nExternalists to prefer more experimentally controlled methods too. (We\nshall see below that to some extent they do.)\n\nDerwing (1973) was one early critic of Chomsky\u2019s view (1969)\nthat experimentally controlled data collection is useless; but it was\nnearly 25 years before systematic research into possible confounding\nvariables in acceptability judgment data started being conducted on\nany significant scale. In the same year that Bard et al. (1996)\nappeared, Carson Sch\u00fctze (1996) published a monograph with the\nfollowing goal statement:\n\nI aim to demonstrate\u2026that grammaticality judgments and other\nsorts of linguistic intuition, while indispensable forms of data for\nlinguistic theory, require new ways of being collected and used. A\ngreat deal is known about the instability and unreliability of\njudgments, but rather than propose that they be abandoned, I endeavor\nto explain the source of their shiftiness and how it can be minimized.\n(1996: 1)\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Wayne Cowart stated that he wanted to\n\u201cdescribe a family of practical methods that yield demonstrably\nreliable data on patterns of sentence acceptability.\u201d He\nobserves that the stability and reliability of acceptability judgment\ncollection is\n\ncomplicated by the fact that there seems to be no consensus on how to\ngather judgments apart from a widespread tolerance for informal\nmethods in which the linguist consults her own intuitions and those of\nthe first handy informant (what we might call the \u201cHey,\nSally\u201d method). (Cowart 1997: 2)\n\n\nSch\u00fctze also expresses the importance of using experimental\nmethods developed in cognitive science:\n\n[M]y claim is that none of the variables that confound\nmetalinguistic data are peculiar to judgments about language. Rather\nthey can be shown to operate in some other domain in a similar way.\n(This is quite similar to Valian\u2019s (1982) claim that the data of\nmore traditional psychological experiments have all the same problems\nthat judgment data have.) (Sch\u00fctze 1996: 14)\n\n\nThe above can be read as sympathetic to the Essentialist preference\nfor elicited judgments.\n\nAmong the findings of Sch\u00fctze and Cowart about informal judgment\ncollection methods are these:\n\nThere is really no agreement in linguistics on what counts as an\ninformal method (though see Sprouse and Almeida 2010 (Other Internet\nResources) for a flat contradiction of this claim).\nThe collection of acceptability judgment data is just as\nvulnerable to the influence of extraneous variables as are other kinds\nof psychological data.\nJudgment samples can be biased in informal judgment\ncollection.\nExperimenter bias is often not controlled for in informal judgment\ncollection.\nJudgment materials are often not carefully prepared to present a\nrelevant, well-ordered, contrasting set of minimal pairs.\nThe instability of one-off speaker judgments can be controlled for\nby gathering judgments from a given speaker across time.\n\n\nAlthough Sch\u00fctze (1996) and Cowart (1997) are both critical of\ntraditional Essentialist informal elicitation methods, their primary\nconcern is to show how the claims of Essentialist linguistics can be\nmade less vulnerable to legitimate complaints about informal data\ncollection methods. Broadly speaking, they are friends of\nEssentialism. Critics of Essentialism have raised similar concerns in\nless friendly terms, but it is important to note that the debate over\nthe reliability of informal methods is a debate within Essentialist\nlinguistics as well.\n",
