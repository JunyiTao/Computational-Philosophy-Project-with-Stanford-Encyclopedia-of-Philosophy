    "main_text": "A Moderate Naturalism || Conceptual Analysis, Intuitions, and Epistemological Methodology\n5.1 Conceptual Analysis, Intuitions, and Epistemological Methodology\n\nAs the passage just quoted suggests, Goldman sees conceptual analysis\nand appeals to intuition as playing an ineliminable role within\nepistemological\n practice.[20]\n While, as noted above, within TE such an analysis has standardly\ntaken the form of a search for necessary and sufficient conditions,\nGoldman is dubious of that specific approach (e.g., 1986: 38\u201339,\n2015, 2007: 23 and papers there cited). Nonetheless, he insists that\n\u201carmchair\u201d conceptual investigation must be the starting\npoint of epistemological theorizing. For this reason he is dubious\nthat a satisfactory epistemology can be entirely concerned with\n\u201cextra-mental phenomena\u201d. In his most recent writing on\nthe subject, Goldman frames the problem (as he sees it) for\nKornblith\u2019s view as follows:\n\n\n\u2026for a given analysandum, there will often be multiple\ncandidates for being the relevant extra-mental phenomenon. If we set\nout to study knowledge empirically, as Kornblith instructs us, we will\nhave an excess of candidate extra-mental phenomena. Starting with\nKornblith\u2019s preferred candidate, there is the set of states that\nconsist in a creature believing a true proposition as a result of\nusing a reliable process. Second, there is the set of states that\nconsist in a creature believing something true (period). Third, there\nis the set of states consisting in a creature believing a proposition\njustifiedly (without its being true). Finally, there is a host of\nadditional candidates, each corresponding to a different theory that\nwas floated in response to the Gettier problem. Which of these many\ncandidate extra-mental phenomena should philosophers of knowledge seek\nto investigate empirically? And how should they choose the one that is\nreally knowledge?\n\nWhat emerges here is that the epistemologist would need some prior\nmethod for choosing the right extra-mental phenomenon. And it seems\ninevitable that the method for making this choice will have to be\nsomething like the traditional one of consulting speakers\u2019 judgments\nabout which states qualify\u2014\u201cintuitively\u201d\u2014as\nstates of knowing. In short, a prior method is needed to pick out\nwhich set of extra-mental events in the world should be the target of\na Kornblithian empirical investigation. Without such a prior method,\nthe epistemologist would be like a blind man sent on a mission without\na guide, or guide dog, to help him. Without a guide, how can one\nselect the relevant extra-mental phenomenon? But Kornblith seems\nintent on denying the epistemologist any such guide. (Goldman\n 2015)[21]\n\n\nGiven that it is anchored in precisely the sort of intuitional\nmethodology and conceptual investigation that is characteristic of TE,\nGoldman\u2019s approach does not of course face any immediate threat\nof (apparent) self-defeat. In what respect, though, is the view\nnaturalistic? In one place, Goldman characterizes his\npreferred form of naturalism\u2014he calls it \u201cmoderate\nnaturalism\u201d\u2014as the combination of two\n theses.[22]\n The first thesis states his commitment, which we encountered above\n (Section 3.2),\n to a psycho-etiological approach to understanding justification\n(warrant, etc.). The second embodies his own view as to how, or how\nfar, the methodology of TE needs to be altered and its autonomy\nmodulated (see the discussion of methodological NE in\n Section 1.2\n above):\n\n\nModerate Naturalism\n\n(A)\nAll epistemic warrant or justification is a function of the\npsychological (perhaps computational) processes that produce or\npreserve belief.\n(B)\nThe epistemological enterprise needs appropriate help from\nscience, especially the science of the mind. (Goldman 1999a:\n26)\n\n\n\nWhat sort of help from science might philosophy need? In\nEpistemology and Cognition (1986) Goldman presents a\n\u201ctwo-stage\u201d model of epistemological inquiry: the first\ninvolves traditional armchair, conceptual analysis to determine the\nkey contours of the relevant concepts (according to Goldman, it\nreveals the centrality of considerations of reliability thereto);\nthereafter it is (or should be) epistemology\u2019s task to determine\n\u201cwhich cognitive processes are available and reliable\u201d;\nand it is here, at this second stage, that \u201ccollaboration with the empirical science of psychology, or cognitive science\u201d\nis needed (2005: 408).\n\nNote:\n (A)\n here states that justification is a function of the psychological\nprocesses that produce or preserve belief. It represents a commitment\nto a certain form or degree of psychologism\n (Section 1.3).\n It does not state that all such justification is a\nposteriori: Goldman rejects the sort of strongly empiricist brand\nof NE that Kornblith and Quine embrace,\n [23]\n and he takes pains to argue that his own reliabilist way of\nunderwriting\n (A)\n is perfectly compatible with the existence of a priori\njustification (see his 1999a). (Kitcher too has suggested \u201cthat\nthe concept of a priori knowledge can be embedded in a naturalistic\nepistemology\u201d; 1980: 4.) And in his Epistemology and\nCognition (1986), for example, Goldman appears to regard the\nconceptual analysis and consulting of intuitions that he sees as\nessential to epistemology as itself a priori (see 1989:\n143).\n\nIn more recent work (Goldman 1999a, 2005, 2007; Goldman & Pust\n1998), however, Goldman has suggested that the conceptual work\ncharacteristic of epistemological theorizing is a form of a\nposteriori, empirical investigation. For example, conceptual\nanalysis typically involves the eliciting (or \u201ctesting\u201d)\nof intuitions\u2014a sample case is presented, and the epistemologist\nasks himself (or others) whether s/he thinks that the subject therein\npossesses knowledge. Rather than seeing this as\nindividuals\u2019 employing some special faculty geared towards\nanswering non-empirical questions, it can be seen as the\nemployment of an essentially experimental, \u201cproto-scientific\nmethod\u201d (2005: 408), geared towards the discovery of facts about\nthe \u201cexperimenter\u2019s\u201d, or others\u2019, epistemic\nconcepts. On this view, even the consultation of one\u2019s own\nintuitions is thoroughly empirical:\n\n\nClassificational intuitions should not be assimilated to mathematical\nor logical intuitions. They are somewhat more like introspections or\nreadouts of one\u2019s own internal states, in this instance, the\nclassificational implications of one\u2019s own concepts. Although\nthey are not perceptual, they share some features with\nobservations\u2026.even intuition-based evidence of the first-person\nkind is not a priori evidence. Moreover, optimal use of one\u2019s\nintuitions to arrive at theories of the contents of concepts, or the\nmeanings of predicates, should take account of semantical and\npsychological theory, both empirical rather than a priori disciplines.\n(Goldman 2005: 409)\n\n\nIn thus (re)casting conceptual analysis and the consulting of\nintuitions as an empirical endeavor, Goldman is moving away from\nBealer (1992) and BonJour (1994), for example, who take it as obvious\nthat the conceptual orientation characteristic of traditional\nepistemological practice marks it as a priori. Just as\nimportantly, Goldman is here moving closer to Kornblith. According to\nGoldman, while a reliance on intuitions, especially in connection with\nthe project of analysis, constitutes an obvious difference between\nphilosophical methodology and the methodology of empirical science,\nthat methodology is still empirical. In this respect,\nphilosophical methodology is not distinctive after all. It can appear\nto be such only because philosophical investigation, at least in its\ninitial stage, has as its target the empirical examination of our\nconcepts. It is his insistence upon the latter\u2014that the\ntarget of armchair empirical investigations are concepts, rather than\nany extra-mental epistemic phenomena themselves\u2014that remains the\ncrucial point on which Goldman and Kornblith\n disagree.[24]\n",
