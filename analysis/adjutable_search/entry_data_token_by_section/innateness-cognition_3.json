    "main_text": "Empirical Findings and Theories || Background: the Piagetian Paradigm and the Core Cognition Hypothesis\n2.1 Background: the Piagetian Paradigm and the Core Cognition Hypothesis\n\n\nThe research we will discuss in this section is inspired by the\nChomskyan paradigm, but there is an important difference between the\nlanguage case and this developmental work. Chomsky\u2019s\nLinguistic Nativism used Skinner\u2019s Behaviorism as a foil, but the\nBehaviorist paradigm was not the reigning scientific paradigm\nin the area of child development. In this field, the Swiss\npsychologist Jean Piaget was the dominant figure, and his research has\nserved as the backdrop for most developmental work over the last 40 or\n50\n years.[17]\n\n\n\nPiaget generally ignored Behaviorism, and conducted experimental\nstudies on the child\u2019s evolving conception of the world.\nHis extensive research agenda included the child\u2019s understanding\nof space, time, God, objects, causality, morality, dreams, number,\nbeing alive, and more. Piaget\u2019s specific questions and\nexperimental results\u2014which were reciprocally (mostly) ignored by\nBehaviorists\u2014have served as a jumping off point for many\nNativist-oriented theorists. But Piaget was not a Nativist.\nThe heart of the Piagetian paradigm is his stage\ntheory. On this view, children start with a very different\nconception of the world than adults have\u2014in fact, Piaget thought\nthat they start without a conception of an external world at\nall\u2014and they go through a series of identifiable stages that\nculminate in adult understanding. The powerful unifying idea here\nis that there is something about the general character of these stages\nthat is the same across all domains of understanding, and that the\ndynamics of stage transition is also uniform. To a first\napproximation, for Piagetians there are no significant distinctions\nbetween the developmental patterns in different domains of\nunderstanding. If we consider any domain, the stage theory\nimposes a uniform grid of steps in the development of that domain\nknowledge. The dynamic picture, again very roughly, is that a\nchild at a stage proceeds until she faces an insurmountable obstacle;\nher present grasp of things makes it impossible for her to deal with a\nrecalcitrant problem. This disequilibrium propels her to the next\n(pre-plotted) stage, in which new internal resources become\navailable\u2014an enriched conception of the world or a new\nflexibility in physical interaction\u2014and the earlier problem can\nbe resolved. The child recovers equilibrium until coping with\nproblems again causes a crisis that leads to the availability of more\nnew resources, and so on. The articulation of the Piagetian\nparadigm involved understanding the general nature of these\nstage-transitions better, exploring how the stage theory operates in\nspecific domains, and understanding the new cognitive and behavioral\nresources that make these transitions possible.\n\n\nPhilosophers will recognize the theory as in some ways analogous to\nthe theories of scientific development proposed by Thomas Kuhn\n(1962/1996) and others. Two important differences are worth\nmentioning, because they highlight what is distinctive about\nPiaget\u2019s approach. First, although science develops\norganically, there is, for Kuhn, no one specific resource that\napplies across all fields. What explains the shift from\none dominant paradigm to another in economics will typically not\nexplain the shift from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican paradigm in\nastronomy. But Piaget held that what makes it possible for the\nchild to advance in her understanding of space is in one sense the\nsame thing as what facilitates the stage transitions in the\nchild\u2019s developing understanding of God or morality.\nSecond, science depends on the contingent, uniquely fruitful\ninnovations that overthrow older understandings and set the stage for\nnew ones. But in children, Piaget\u2019s developmental stages\nare posited as mandatory; we might say they are innately prescribed\nsteps in normal development. The child\u2019s forward motion is\nregularized as the world presents its predictable problems, and the new\nresources become available to solve them and advance the child\u2019s\nunderstanding. The upshot is that although Piagetians produced\nprobing and highly detailed studies of various domains of the\nchild\u2019s understanding, they shared the Empiricist preference for\nan across-the-board domain-general mechanism that could explain the\ndevelopmental facts in every domain. Although there are\ninteresting ideas inherent in the Piagetian paradigm about the innate\nendowment that makes adult cognition possible, it is not easy to place\nPiagetian Constructivism on the Nativist-Empiricist\n spectrum.[18]\n\n\nPiaget\u2019s theories provided the scientific received view\nagainst which developmentalists inspired by Chomsky\u2019s linguistics\nreacted. These researchers set aside Piaget\u2019s assumption\nthat development is uniform across domains, and instead\u2014in part\ninspired by Chomsky\u2019s organology and modularity\nclaims\u2014considered each domain independently. The overall\nstrategy was to discover the cognitive capacities of the youngest\nchildren, and to develop and test hypotheses about (i) the initial\nstate, and (ii) the transitions that move the child from the initial\nstate to the normal adult repertoire.\n\nThe \u2018Core Cognition\u2019 hypothesis. Many\ndevelopmentalists in this camp share a commitment to the \u2018Core\nCognition\u2019 (sometimes called \u2018Core Knowledge\u2019)\nhypothesis (Carey 2009; Carey\n& Spelke 1996; Spelke et al. 1992; Spelke 1998, 2000, 2003). According to this hypothesis,\nevolution has equipped our species (and other species too) with an\ninnate repertoire of conceptual representation types, that is,\nrepresentations that cannot be reduced to the perceptual primitives\nfavored by the Empiricists or the sensory-motor primitives favored by\nPiagetians. Rather, evolution has shaped our perceptual input\nanalyzers to detect certain types of entities in the world, and has provided us with principles\u2014embodied in our cognitive machinery\u2014that determine how we (at least initially) think about such entities. These different types of\nentities are few in number. To date, there is a consensus among proponents of this\nhypothesis that the innately specified core domains\ninclude physical objects, number, and minds.[19] Proponents of the\nCore Cognition view defend a moderate Nativism; they leave work for learning mechanisms, which, together with\nmaturation, take the infant from limited \u2018core\u2019\nconceptual systems to the broad and highly elaborated knowledge of\nthe world that adults have. In some cases, adult knowledge\nextends the core; in others it \u2018over-writes\u2019 it. The conceptual machinery that embodies a core domain is often referred to as an \u2018intuitive theory\u2019\u2014for instance, a folk physics or folk psychology (sometimes theory of mind)\u2014to highlight the fact that each supports patterns of conceptualization of input and inference.  There is intense ongoing work on core domains, and research paradigms are being extended to non-human animals and across cultures.  In\nthe sections that follow, we review select findings on three\ndomains: physical objects, number, and intentional agents.[20]\nWe concentrate on very early\ndevelopment. While it is often difficult to say what\nexactly the research reveals about the young child\u2019s\nknowledge (for methodological as well as philosophical\nreasons), the earlier some distinctive elements of a competence are\npresent, the less likely that it was learned solely on the\nbasis of experience.\n\nMethodological innovation: the\n\u2018violation-of-expectancy\u2019 looking time. The work\nwe discuss depended on solving a knotty methodological problem: how to\ndiscover what is going on in the minds of preverbal infants and very\nyoung children? Though infants cannot report on what they are\nperceiving or thinking, one can make inferences from their reactions to\nobjects and events. Long before they utter their first words,\nthey suck, grasp, creep, crawl, and\u2014most importantly\u2014they\nlook. Since infants, like adults and other animals, look longer\nat an unexpected stimulus, where they look and for how long they look\ncan reveal a good deal about their expectations about the\nworld. While measures of grasping, crawling, and sucking have all\nbeen successfully used to reveal some of what is going on in the baby\u2019s\nmind, the measure that has been used most extensively is the\nviolation-of-expectancy looking time (sometimes called\npreferential looking time). Experiments using this measure\ntend to have a similar structure: during an initial phase, the child\nis presented with display \\(X\\), over and over, until the child\u2019s\ninterest wanes and looking time drops down to some criterion\n(the habituation phase). In the test phase, the\nchild is presented with two displays: \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\). If\nthe child reliably looks longer at \\(Y\\) than at \\(Z\\), this\nprovides evidence that \\(Z\\) is as expected, but that \\(Y\\)\nis unexpected.\n",
