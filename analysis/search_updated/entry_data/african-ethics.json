    "main_text": "\n1. On the terms \u2018Ethics\u2019 and \u2018Morality\u2019\n\n\nThe term \u2018ethics\u2019 is technically used by philosophers to\nmean a philosophical study of morality\u2014morality understood as a\nset of social rules, principles, norms that guide or are intended to\nguide the conduct of people in a society, and as beliefs about right\nand wrong conduct as well as good or bad character. Even though\nmorality is the subject matter of ethics, it is most often used\ninterchangeably with \u2018ethics\u2019. In spite of the\nphilosophical inquiries or analyses undertaken by individual\nmoral philosophers regarding morality (i.e., the morality of a\nsociety or people)\u2014analyses which often result in diverse positions or\nconclusions\u2014nevertheless, the basic features, the core elements\nof the morality of a society, those moral principles and values that\nactually guide and influence the lives of a people, remain pretty much\nwhat they are or have been. What individual moral philosophers, through\ntheir critical analyses and arguments, try to do is to explain,\nclarify, refine, sharpen, or enlarge the understanding of the concepts\nand issues of morality. Even though the moral beliefs and circumstances\nof their own societies constitute the immediate focus of their\nphilosophical activities\u2014for human experience is most directly\nfelt within some specific social or cultural\ncontext\u2014nevertheless, moral philosophers do not think or imply at\nall that the results of their reflective activities are to be tethered\nto their own societies as such. They believe, to the contrary, that, in the\nlight of our common humanity, which speaks to the common sentiments,\npurposes, responses, hopes, and aspirations of all human beings in\nrespect of certain situations, the conclusions of their reflections\nwould, surely, have implications for the capacious community of humankind, for\nthe universal human family.\n\n\nThus, moral principles and rules may emerge from or evolved by a\nparticular human society; even so, they are principles that\ncan\u2014and do\u2014apply to all human societies inasmuch as they\nrespond to basic human needs, interests, and purposes. When the Akan\nmoralist maintains, for instance, that \u2018To possess virtue is\nbetter than gold\u2019, or \u2018When virtue founds a town, the town\nthrives and abides\u2019, he strongly believes that he is making a\nmoral statement\u2014he is enunciating a moral principle\u2014that\ntranscends his own community and applies not only to other towns in his\nnation but, indeed, to all human societies, just as Socrates\nsurely intended his celebrated moral statement \u2018Virtue is\nknowledge\u2019 (whether true or not) to apply to peoples and cultures\nbeyond Athens and Greece, even beyond fifth century Greece. Thus, the\nmoral intent of the morally-freighted proverbs (or maxims) discussed in this entry\nis considered relevant to the moral life of the human being and, as\nsuch, is purported to have universal application or reference.\n\n\nAfter the reflective activities of the individual moral thinkers, the\nbeliefs and presuppositions of a people about right and wrong conduct,\ngood and bad character\u2014all of which featured in the moral life\nof the people prior to the activities of moral thinkers\u2014remain\nsubstantially or generally unscathed; they continue to constitute the\nmoral framework within which the members of the society\nfunction. Thus, even though a theoretical (or, academic) distinction\ncan be made between morality as constituted by the moral beliefs and\nprinciples that a group of people abides by in their daily lives (let\nus refer to this kind of morality as morality1) and\nmorality or ethics as comprising the reflections of moral thinkers on\nhuman conduct, on morality1 (let us refer to the reflective\nenterprise regarding morality as morality2), nevertheless,\nto the extent that morality2 provides a clarification and\nbetter explanation and understanding of morality1, it can\nbe said that the two terms, morality and ethics, refer essentially to\nthe same moral phenomenon\u2014human conduct\u2014and, thus, can be\nused interchangeably. Thus, in this entry, the term \u2018African\nethics\u2019 is used to refer both to the moral beliefs and\npresuppositions of the sub-Saharan African people and the\nphilosophical clarification and interpretation of those beliefs and\npresuppositions.\n\n\nI take note of a view expressed by some philosophers on\nAristotle's ethics: Bertrand Russell observed that\n\u201cAristotle's opinions on moral questions are always such as\nwere conventional in his day\u201d (1945: 174). This view is re-echoed\nby Hardie: \u201c[Aristotle's] moral ideas and moral ideals are,\nin some degree, the product of his time\u201d (1968: 120); he also\nasserts that \u201cAristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics is at\nleast in part an interpreter of Greek experience\u201d (W. F. R\nHardie, 1968: 123). In the same way, this entry present an\ninterpretretation of the moral ideas and values as found in the\nAfrican moral language, conceptions of society, conceptions of a\nperson, and so on.\n\n\nAlso, in this entry, \u2018African\u2019 refers to the salient\nfeatures or ideas of the African moral life and thought generally as\nreflected in, or generated by, African moral language and social\nstructure and life.  Many writers have made the observation that\ndespite the indisputable cultural diversity that arises from Africa's\nethnic pluralism, there are underlying affinities in many areas of the\nAfrican life; this is surely true in the African religious and moral\noutlook. There are some features of the moral life and thought of\nvarious African societies that, according to the cited sources, are\ncommon or shared features. There are other features that can be seen\nas common on conceptual or logical grounds. For instance, the claim\nthat the values and principles of African morality are not founded on\nreligion simply derives from the characterization of traditional\nAfrican religion as a non-revealed religion. (In the history\nof the indigenous religion in African, it does not seem that anyone in\nany African community, has ever claimed to have received a revelation\nfrom the Supreme Being intended either for the people of the community\nor for all humanity). This characterization makes African ethics\nindependent of religion and, thus, underlines the notion of the\nautonomy of ethics in regard to African ethics. If a religion is a\nnon-revealed religion, then it is independent of religious\nprescriptions and commands. The characterization of traditional\nAfrican religion would, thus, lead me to assert\u2014to generalize on\nlogical grounds\u2014that the moral system of each African\nsociety\u2014in the traditional setting\u2014does not derive from\nreligion: thus, it is an autonomous moral system. Similarly, the claim\nabout the social (non-individualistic) morality of the African society\nis closely related to the community and shared life of the African\npeople. And so on.\n\n\nThus, while Akan ethics is not a microcosm of African ethics, there is\nnevertheless evidence, both empirical and conceptual, that indicates\nthat the values, beliefs, and principles of Akan ethics\nreverberate mutatis mutandis on the moral terrains of other\nAfrican societies. Based on the qualifying expression mutatis\nmutandis (\u2018allowing for necessary variations and\nadjustments\u2019), it would be correct to say that the term\n\u2018African ethics\u2019 is appropriate. With all this said,\nhowever, neither Akan nor African ethics would be unique among the\nethical systems evolved by the various non-African cultures of the\nworld.\n2. African Words for Ethics (or Morality)\n\n\nWe would begin with an inquiry into African moral language, in\nsearch specifically of the word for \u2018ethics\u2019 in a few\nAfrican languages. Such an inquiry will give some insight into the\nbasic conception and understanding of ethics or morality. It must be\nnoted right from the outset that a substantial number of Sub-Saharan\nAfrican languages do not have words that can be said to be\ndirect equivalents of the word \u2018ethics\u2019 or\n\u2018morality\u2019. Here are some interesting results of inquiries\nmade from native speakers of a few African languages and how\nstatements about a person's ethical or moral conduct are expressed in\nthose languages, including two of the prominent languages in Ghana,\nAkan (the author's native language) and Ewe.\n\nWhen a speaker of the Akan language wants to say, \u201cHe has\nno morals\u201d, or, \u201cHe is immoral\u201d, or \u201cHe is\nunethical\u201d, \u201cHis conduct is unethical\u201d, he would\nalmost invariably say, \u201cHe has no character\u201d\n(Onni suban).\nThe statement, \u201cHe has no morals\u201d, or \u201cHe is\nunethical\u201d, is expressed by a speaker of the Ewe language as,\nnonomo mele si o (which means \u201cHe has no\ncharacter\u201d).\nIn Yoruba language and thought the word iwa means both\ncharacter and morality (it also means \u2018being\u2019 or\n\u2018nature\u2019).\nIn Igbo language of Eastern Nigeria, the word agwa,\nmeaning character, is used in such a statement as \u201che has no\nmorals\u201d (onwe ghi ezi agwa).\nIn Shona, the language spoken by a substantial majority of the\npeople of Zimbabwe, the word tsika means \u2018ethics\u2019\nor \u2018morality\u2019. But when they want to say of a person that\n\u201cHe has no morals\u201d, or \u201cHe is unethical\u201d, they\nwould often use the word hunhu which directly means\n\u2018character\u2019. Thus, Haana hunhu means \u201cHe has\nno character\u201d, \u201cHe is not moral\u201d, \u201cHe is\nunethical\u201d.\nIn South Sotho, a language spoken widely in Lesotho and southern\nZimbabwe (Matebeleland), there are no words that are the direct\nequivalents of \u2018ethics\u2019 or \u2018morality\u2019.\nReferences to the moral or ethical life or behavior are made using\nwords that mean behavior or character. Thus, moral statements such as\n\u201che has no morals\u201d or \u201chis action is unethical\u201d\nwill be expressed by words such as maemo\u2014which means\ncharacter or behavior: thus, maemo a mabe means \u201che has\na bad character\u201d, \u201chis behavior (action) is\nunethical.\u201d When a person behaves (or acts) in ways that are\nmorally right, they would say \u201che has a good character\u201d,\nusing the words lokileng or boitswaro, both of which\nmean good character or good behavior.\n\n\n\nThus, the inquiries into the moral language of several African\npeoples or cultures indicate that in these languages the word or\nexpression that means \u2018character\u2019 is used to refer to what\nothers call \u2018ethics\u2019 or \u2018morality\u2019. Discourses\nor statements about morality turn to be discourses or statements\nessentially about character. In Islamic moral philosophy the word used\nfor \u2018ethics\u2019, namely, akhlaq, means character. The\nimplication here is that ethics or morality is conceived in terms\nessentially of character. It is noteworthy that the Greek word\nethike, from which the English word \u2018ethics\u2019\nderives means \u2018character.\u2019 (ethos) What we call\n\u2018ethics\u2019 Aristotle calls \u2018the study (or, science) of\ncharacter\u2019, he ethike. For the Greek, as for the\nAfrican and the Arab, the character of the individual matters most in our moral\nlife and thought. \n3. The Notion of Character as Central to African  Ethics\n\n\nThere are of course other moral concepts in the African moral\nlanguage and thought. The concepts of good, bad (or, evil), right and\nwrong feature prominently in African moral thought, as they do in the\nmoral systems of other peoples and cultures. In Akan, for instance,\npa or papa means good and bone means bad or\nevil (see below). Thus, the expression onipa bone means a bad\nperson. A bad person is said to be a person with a bad character,\nsuban bone. When a person is known to be honest or generous or\ncompassionate, he would be judged by the Akan as a good person, by\nwhich they mean that he has a good character (suban). A person would\nbe judged as having a bad character if he is considered\ndishonest, wicked, or cruel. In most moral evaluations reference is\nmade to the character of a person; thus, character is basic\u2014the\ncrucial element\u2014in Akan, as it is in African, ethics generally.\nIwa (character) is, for the Yoruba, \u201cperhaps the most\nimportant moral concept. A person is morally evaluated according to\nhis/her iwa\u2014whether good or bad\u201d (Gbadegesin, 1991:\n79). African ethics is, thus, a character-based ethics that maintains\nthat the quality of the individual's character is most\nfundamental in our moral life.\n\n\nGood character is the essence of the African moral system, the\nlinchpin of the moral wheel. The justification for a character-based\nethics is not far to seek. For, all that a society can do, regarding\nmoral conduct, is to impart moral knowledge to its members, making\nthem aware of the moral values and principles of that society. In\ngeneral, society satisfactorily fulfills this duty of imparting moral\nknowledge to its members through moral education of various forms,\nincluding, as in African societies, telling morally-freighted proverbs\nand folktales to its younger members. But, having moral\nknowledge\u2014being made aware of the moral principles and rules of\nthe society\u2014is one thing; being able to lead a life consonant\nwith the moral principles is quite another. An individual may know and\nmay even accept a moral rule, such as, say, it is wrong to cheat the\ncustoms. But he may fail to apply this rule to a particular situation;\nhe is, thus, not able to effect the transition from knowledge to\naction, to carry out the implications of his moral belief.\n\n\nIn the Akan and other African moral systems such a moral failure\nwould be put down to the lack of a good character (suban pa).\nIn other words, the ability to act in accord with the moral principles\nand rules of the society requires the possession of a good character.\nThus, in the context of the activities of the moral life\u2014in our\ndecisions to obey moral rules, in the struggle to do the right thing\nand to avoid the wrong conduct, in one's intention to carry out a\nmoral duty, the quality of a person's character is of ultimate\nconsequence. It is from a person's character that all his or her\nactions\u2014good or bad\u2014radiate: the performance of good or bad acts\ndepends on the state of one's character. Wrong-doing is put down\nto a person's bad character. Thus, the Yoruba maxim (proverb):\n\u2018Good character is a person's guard.\u2019\n\n\nAfrican maxims are explicit about the formation of character:\ncharacter is acquired. A person is therefore responsible for the state\nof his or her character, for character results from the habitual\nactions of a person. An Akan maxim has it that \u201cone is not born\nwith a bad \u2018head\u2019, but one takes it on from the\nearth.\u201d The maxim means, among other things, that a bad habit is\nnot an inborn characteristic; it is one that is acquired. It would be\nworthless to embark on moral instruction through moral proverbs and\nfolktales, as it is done in African societies, if our character or\nhabits were inborn. But the belief is that the moral narratives would\nhelp the young people to acquire and internalize the moral values of\nthe society, including specific moral virtues, embedded in those\nethical narratives. The appropriate responses to moral instruction are\nexpected to lead to the acquisition of appropriate habits and their\ncorresponding characters. And, because character is acquired through\nour actions, habits, and expected responses to moral instructions, it\ncan, according to African moral systems, be changed or\nreformed.\n\n\nCharacter is defined by the Akan thinkers in terms of habits, which\nresult from a person's deeds or actions: \u2018character comes\nfrom your actions\u2019 (or deeds: nneyee), says an Akan\ntraditional thinker. Persistent performance of a particular action will\nproduce a certain habit and, thus, a corresponding character. To\nacquire virtue, a person must perform good actions, that is, morally\nacceptable actions so that they become habitual. The action or deed\nthat led to the acquisition of a newly good habit must be persistently\nperformed in order to strengthen that habit; in this way,virtue (or,\ngood character) is acquired. Over time such an acquired virtue becomes\na habit. This is the position of Akan ethics on the development and\nacquisition of a good (or, bad) character, for this is what the Akan\npeople mean when they say aka ne ho, \u201cit has remained\nwith him,\u201d \u201cit has become part of him,\u201d \u201cit has\nbecome his habit.\u201d Character is, thus, a behavior pattern formed\nas a result of past persistent actions. Thus, moral virtues\n(excellences of character) or vices arise through habituation.\n\n\nThe logic of the acquisition of our character or habits is that the\noriginal nature of the human being was morally neutral, neither good\nnor bad. A person's original moral neutrality will in the course\nof his life come to be affected, in one direction (the good) or the\nother direction (the bad) by his actions and responses to moral\ninstruction, advice and persuasion. The original moral neutrality of a\nhuman being constitutes the foundation of our conception of the moral\nperson, for it makes for\u2014allows room for\u2014choice, that is, moral\nchoice. Consequently, what a person does or does not do is most crucial\nto the formation and development of his or her character, and, thus, to\nbecoming moral or immoral.\n4. Moral Personhood\n\nLet me start the analysis of moral personhood in African moral\nphilosophy with a statement made by Ifeanyi Menkiti, an African\nphilosopher from Nigeria:\n\n The various societies found in traditional Africa routinely accept\nthis fact that personhood is the sort of thing which has to be\nattained, and is attained in direct proportion as one participates in\ncommunal life through the discharge of the various obligations defined\nby one's stations.  It is the carrying out of these obligations\nthat transforms one from the it-status of early child-hood, marked by\nan absence of moral function, into the person-status of later\nyears, marked by a widened maturity of ethical sense\u2014an ethical\nmaturity without which personhood is conceived as eluding\none. (Ifeanyi Menkiti, 1984: 176)\n\n\nMenkiti's statement adumbrates a conception of moral personhood, which\nwill now be discussed in some detail. The concept of a person in\nAfrican thought embodies ethical presuppositions. The word used for\n\u201cperson\u201d in the Akan language (undoubtedly the most widely\nspoken language in Ghana) is onipa. But the word\nonipa also means \u201chuman being\u201d and the plural form\nof it means \u201cpeople\u201d. Thus, the word onipa is an\nambiguous word. In the Akan society, when an individual's conduct\nvery often appears cruel, wicked, selfish, ungenerous or unsympathetic,\nit would be said of that individual that \u201che is not a\nperson\u201d (onnye onipa).\n\n\nIn Yoruba language the word eniyan means a person. Even\nthough the word is used in a normative as well as non-normative (or,\nordinary) sense, \u201cgreater emphasis is placed on the normative\ndimension of eniyan\u201d (Gbadagesin, 1991: 27). It can be\nsaid of some human individual that \u2018he or she is not a person\u2019\n(Ki i se eniyan). Such a comment is a \u201cjudgment of the\nmoral standing of the human being who is thus determined to fall short\nof what it takes to be recognized as such\u201d (Gbadagesin, 1991:\n27).\n\n\nThe Akan statement onnye onipa and the Yoruba statement\nKi i se eniyan both underline a conception of moral\npersonhood. The two statements are significant in two ways. The first\nis that, even though that individual is said not to be a\nperson, he is nonetheless acknowledged as a human being, not a\nbeast or fish. It is pretty clear that the statement implies a\ndistinction between the concept of a human being and the concept of a\nperson: an individual can be a human being without being a\nperson.\n\n\nThe second significant thing the statements imply is the assumption\nthat there are certain fundamental norms and ideals to which the\nconduct of a human being, if he is a person, ought to conform,\nthat there are moral virtues that an individual has the capacity to\ndisplay in his conduct and ought to display them, if he is a person.\nThe reason for the judgment that an individual is not a person if he\nbehaves or does not behave in a certain way is that that\nindividual's actions and behavior are considered as falling short\nof the ideals and standards of personhood. But it does not imply at all\nthat an individual considered \u201cnot a person\u201d loses his\nrights as a human being or as a citizen or that people in the community\nshould cease to demonstrate a moral concern for him or display the\nappropriate moral virtues in their treatment of him; only that he is\nnot considered a morally worthy individual.\n\n\nNow, the judgment that a human being is \u201cnot a person\u201d,\nmade in the wake of that individual's persistent unethical\nbehavior, implies that the practice of moral virtue is considered\nintrinsic to the conception of a person held in Akan or Yoruba moral\nthought. The position here is this: for any p, if p\nis person, then p ought to display in his behavior the moral\nnorms and ideals of personhood. When the behavior of a human being\nfails to conform to the acceptable moral principles or standards, or\nwhen a human being fails to display the expected moral virtues in his\nconduct, he is considered to be \u201cnot a\nperson.\u201d\n\n\nThe evaluative judgment opposite to the one we have been considering\nis \u201che is a person\u201d (oye onipa). This judgment is\nnot a descriptive judgment at all, even though it can be used\ndescriptively, as when in a forest one hunter made that judgment to his\ncolleague hunter who thought he saw a beast and was about to shoot it:\nthe judgment \u201che is a person\u201d (oye onipa) would in\nthat context be used descriptively by the other hunter to distinguish a\nhuman being from a beast. Thus, a descriptive use of that judgment\nwould be obvious and easily understood.\n\n\nWhat I am concerned to point up in the present circumstance is the\nnormative form of the judgment. Used normatively, the\njudgment, \u201che is a person,\u201d means \u2018he has a good\ncharacter\u2019, \u2018he is generous\u2019, \u2018he is\npeaceful\u2019, \u2018he is humble,\u2019 \u2018he has respect for\nothers.\u2019 A profound appreciation of the high standards of the\nmorality of an individual's behavior would elicit the judgment,\n\u201che is truly a person,\u201d (oye onipa paa!). A rider\nwould be in place here: while children are actual human beings and are\nmembers of the human community, they are not actual persons yet; they\nare persons only potentially and will attain the status of personhood\nin the fullness of time when they are able to exercise their moral\ncapacity and make moral judgments.\n\n\nNow, the denial of personhood to a human being on the grounds that\nhis actions are not in accord with certain fundamental norms and ideals\nof personhood or that that individual fails to display certain\nvirtues in his behavior is morally significant and worth noting. It\nmeans that human nature is considered in Akan metaphysical and moral\nthought to be essentially good, not depraved or warped by some original\nsin; that the human being is capable of doing good. It does not mean,\nhowever, that personhood, in this model of humanity, is innate but is\nearned in the ethical arena: it is the individual's moral\nachievement that earns him the status of a person. Every individual is\ncapable of becoming a person inasmuch as he has capacity for\nvirtue\u2014for performing morally right actions\u2014and should be treated (at\nleast potentially) as a morally responsible agent.\n\n\nIn this connection, let us pay some attention to the Akan belief\nembedded in a maxim that says, \u201cGod created every human being\n(to be) good\u201d (Onyame boo obiara yie). The view\nexpressed in this proverb seems to be at variance with the notion of\nthe moral-neutrality of the human being discussed earlier in\nconnection with character (section 3). The meaning of the maxim\n\u201cGod created every human (to be) good\u201d is not too clear;\nit may be interpreted in two ways. First, it may be taken as implying\nthat God created the human being actually to do good, that is, to\nactually behave virtuously and to always make the appropriate moral\nchoices. Second, it may be interpreted as meaning that God made the\nhuman being capable of moral choice, that is, that the human being was\nmerely endowed by his creator with the moral sense to distinguish\nbetween good and evil, right and wrong. The first interpretation\nimplies that the human being has been determined to be\ngood\u2014to actually pursue virtue: thus, the human being's\nmoral status is a settled matter. If the human being were created or\ndetermined actually and always to do good, there would never have been\na concept of evil or vice (bone) in Akan moral language,\nsince no human being would, in that kind of moral context, commit a\nvicious or evil act. In light of the evil and unethical actions of\nindividual human beings, the first interpretation which implies that\nthe human being is resiliently good cannot be accepted as the correct\nmeaning of the maxim, for it is plainly contradicted by our putative\nmoral experience. The first interpretation also subverts\nmoral-neutrality, a consequence that eliminates moral choice\u2014basic to\nthe notion of a moral person.\n\n\nThe second interpretation of the view that the human being was created\ngood (or, to be good), implies that the human being merely has the\ncapacity for virtue: that is, could pursue good, but could also pursue\nevil.  This means that the human being is endowed with moral sense\nand, so, has the capacity for both virtue and vice; his judgment on\nsome moral issue could go either direction: direction of the good or\ndirection of the evil. Thus, the notion of moral neutrality is\npreserved. The human being can then be held as a moral agent: not that\nhis virtuous character is a settled matter, but that he is capable of\nvirtue, and hence, of moral achievement, and can, thus, achieve\npersonhood.\n\n\nThe correctness of the second interpretation of the view that the\nhuman being was created good, as argued in the foregoing paragraphs,\ncan have an anchor also in the Akan notion of tiboa:\nconscience, moral sense\u2014a sense of right or wrong. This is a\nconception of an inner urge relevant to moral practice. Tiboa\nis held, among other things, as creating a sense of guilt in the\nindividual, convicting him or her of wrong deeds. Since response to a\nmoral rule is ultimately an individual or private affair, the notion of\ntiboa (conscience) is of great importance to our moral life.\nIt is by virtue of tiboa that the notion of self-sanctioning\nin moral conduct becomes intelligible. Because of its power to induce a\nsense of guilt, tiboa is held to influence the\nindividual's moral choice, decision, response, and attitude. The\nreality or phenomenon of moral choice is a rejection of the notion of a\nfixed or settled moral character of an individual that derives from the\npresupposition\u2014albeit false\u2014that the human being is born\nvirtuous. The activity of tiboa is in line with the\nmoral neutrality of the human being at birth. The activity of\ntiboa assists moral achievement and, thus, moral\npersonhood.\n\n\nLike the Akan people and others, the Rwanda (or, Ruanda) people also\nhave the concept of conscience. \u201cThe Rwanda word for conscience,\nkamera, means something that is internally felt. It is\nsituated in the heart\u201d (J. J. Maquet in Forde, 1954: 183). There\nindeed are external social sanctions which are useful as deterrents\nfrom prohibited behavior; but in moral motivation feelings of moral\nguilt and shame are traceable also to kamera or\ntiboa.\n5. The Humanistic Foundations of African Morality\n\n\nObservations have been made by a number of scholars that Africans\nare a very\u2014even a notoriously\u2014religious people, that religion so\ndeeply permeates all spheres of their lives that it cannot be\ndistinguished from nonreligious aspects of life, that in the African\ntraditional life there are no atheists, and that the African cultural\nheritage is intensely and pervasively religious. Historical evidence\nindicates that many colonial administrators in their dispatches to\ntheir colonial metropolis used to refer to Africans as \u2018this\nincurably religious people.\u2019 Assertions about the religiosity of\nthe African people have led some scholars to maintain that there is a\nconnection between religion and morality in African ethics. That some\nconnection may exist between religion and morality is conceivable in an\nenvironment that is widely alleged to be pervasively religious. But the\nnature of the connection needs to be fully clarified.\n\n\nThe connection has been taken by most scholars to mean that African\nmoral values and principles derive from religion, implying that\nAfrican morality is, thus, a religious morality (Opoku, 1978: 152),\nDanquah (1944: 3), Sarpong (1972: 41), Busia (1967: 16), Parrinder\n(1969: 28\u20139), Idowu (1962: 146). The claim implies in turn that\nthe moral beliefs and principles of the African people derive from\nthose of religion, that religion provides the necessary justification\nfor moral values and beliefs, and that moral concepts, such as good,\nbad, right and wrong, are defined (or, must be defined) in terms of\nreligious prescriptions or commands. However, there are other\nscholars, such as Godfrey Wilson, Monica Wilson, Maquet, Wiredu, who\ndeny the religious basis of the moral systems of the societies they\nstudied. Kwasi Wiredu observed that \u201cthe Akan moral outlook is\nthus logically independent of religion\u201d (Kwasi Wiredu in\nH. Odera Oruka and D. A. Masolo, 1983: 13). Godfrey Wilson wrote that\n\u201cAmong the Nyakyusa the ideas of social behaviour are not\nconnected with religion, nonetheless they exist\u201d and, after\nmentioning the moral virtues of the Nyakyusa, he added that \u201cBut\nthe positive, ideal statement of these virtues is not made in\nreligious terms\u201d (Godfrey Wilson in Ottenberg and Ottenberg\neds., 1960: 348). On the morality of the Rwanda, Maquet wrote that\n\u2018Thus the ethics of the Banyarwanda are not integrated on a\nreligious basis such as the will of God' (J. J. Maquet in Forde,\n1954:184). In Mende ethics, \u201cWrongbehavior is regarded as a\nbreaking of some specific rule of conduct, not as the flouting of some\ndivine or absolute law of the universe\u201d (Kenneth Little, in\nForde, 1954:134). These are unambiguous statements of the nonreligious\nfoundation of the morality of at least some African societies.\n\n\nThe claim, made by many scholars, that African morality is founded\non, or derives from, religion cannot, in my opinion, be upheld, if by\nmorality we are referring to social principles and norms that guide the\nconduct of people in a society. One reason is that, unlike Islam or\nChristianity, the traditional, that is, indigenous, African religion is\nnot a revealed religion whereby divine truth is revealed to a single\nindividual who becomes the founder. It is true that African religious\nexperience certainly features mystical or highly spiritual encounters\nbetween human beings (that is, priests, priestesses, diviners, etc.)\nand spiritual beings. Such encounters occur in divinations, spirit\nmediums, communication with the dead, and other forms of the mystical\nexperience. But, it may be noted, such mystical or spiritual encounters\nor contacts take place in an atmosphere that was already\nreligious; they are some of the manifestations of African religion, of\nAfrican spirituality.\n\n\nI define spirituality as a heightened form of religiosity\nreached by certain individuals in the community who have, or claim to\nhave, mystical contacts with the supernatural, the divine. It would be\ncorrect to assert, however, that the encounters are the\nresults, rather than the sources, of religion in Africa in the\ntraditional setting. And, even though \u2018spiritual messages\u2019\nmay be received by the practitioners of traditional African religion\nthrough those mystical encounters part of which\n(\u2018messages\u2019) may relate to moral conduct, nevertheless such\nmessages appear to be too few and far between to constitute an adequate\nbasis for a coherent ethical system. Moreover, the .moral character of\nsuch \u2018messages\u2019 would, in a non-revealed religious context,\nhave to be judged by the people themselves on the basis of their own\nmoral insights. This is a telling point that implies the independence\n(autonomy) of the moral attitudes of the people with regard to the\nconduct of the spiritual beings. This is the reason why an eminent\nGhanaian sociologist observed that \u201cThe gods are treated with\nrespect if they deliver the goods, and with contempt if they\nfail\u2026.Attitudes to [the gods] depend on their success [i.e., the\nsuccess of the gods], and vary from healthy respect to sneering\ncontempt\u201d (K. A. Busia in Forde, 1954: 205). The moral\ndisapprobation of the people with regard to the actions\u2014particularly\nthe unsuccessful actions\u2014of the deities constitutes the ground for the\nextinction of some of the deities from the Akan, possibly the African,\npantheon. The fact that the behavior of a supernatural being is thus\nsubject to human censure implies that it is possible for a\ndeity to issue commands that can be considered unethical by the\npractitioners of traditional religion. All this implies, surely, that\nit would be correct to assert that, rather than regarding African ethics\nas religious (or, religious-based), it would be more correct to regard\nAfrican religion as ethical.\n\n\nIn a revealed religion, what is revealed is generally\nelaborate and can be conceived to include moral principles and ideals\nas part of the will of God thus revealed. A morality that is founded on\nreligion is thus a necessary concomitant of a revealed religion. Since\nthe indigenous African religion is not a revealed religion, there is no\nway by which the people would have access to the will of God that\ncontains elaborate moral principles upon which a coherent moral system\ncan be erected. In the context of a non-revealed religion, then, to\nmake divine or supernatural commands the source of moral values and\nprinciples would be conceptually impossible.\n\n\nNow, how are the moral concepts of good, evil, right and wrong\nunderstood or defined in African ethics? When put to traditional\nsages (thinkers) of some Akan communities in Ghana the question, how do\nwe come to know that \u2018this action\u2019 is good and \u2018that\naction\u2019 is evil? no one responded that an action is good or evil\nbecause God (Onyame) had said so or that Onyame had\ntold us so. Thus, what is morally good or right is not that which is\ncommanded by God or pleasing to God or any spiritual being, or that\nwhich is in accordance with the will of a spiritual being. The\nresponses revealed, on the contrary, an undoubted conviction of a\nhumanistic\u2014a non-supernatural\u2014origin of moral values and\nprinciples, a conviction that provided insight into the Akan conception\nof the criterion of moral value. According to the ethics of the\nBanyarwanda, \u201cThat is good (or evil) which tradition has defined\nas good (or evil)\u201d (J. J. Maquet, loc. cit). In light of\nthe non-revealed nature of traditional African religion, it can be said\nthat the view regarding the non-religious (non-supernatural) origin of\nmoral principles and values would resonate on the moral terrains of\nmost other African communities. The sources of African morality in the\ntraditional setting, then, must be held as independent of religious\nprescriptions or supernatural powers.\n\n\nThe views of the traditional thinkers indicate that what is\ngood is constituted by the deeds, habits, and behavior patterns\nconsidered by the society as worthwhile because of their consequences\nfor human welfare. The goods would include such things as generosity,\nhonesty, faithfulness, truthfulness, compassion, hospitality,\nhappiness, that which brings peace, justice, respect, and so on. Each\nof these actions or patterns of behavior is supposed or known to bring\nabout social well-being. In Akan moral system (or African moral system\ngenerally), good or moral value is determined in terms of its\nconsequences for humankind and human society. All this can be\ninterpreted to mean that African morality originates from\nconsiderations of human welfare and interests, not from divine\npronouncements. Actions that promote human welfare or interest are\ngood, while those that detract from human welfare are bad. It is, thus,\npretty clear that African ethics is a humanistic ethics, a moral system\nthat is preoccupied with human welfare. Referring to African morality\ngenerally, Monica Wilson observed that \u201cThe basis of morality was\nfulfillment of obligation to kinsmen and neighbors, and living in amity\nwith them\u201d (1971: 98).\n\nIn African conceptions moral values originate from the\nbasic existential conditions in which human beings organize and conduct\ntheir lives. McVeigh made the following observation:\n\nTherefore, it is important to inquire concerning the African standard\nof judgment, what makes some things good and others bad. [Edwin] Smith\nreplies that the norm of right and wrong is custom; that is, the good\nis that which receives the community's approval; the bad is that\nwhich is disapproved. The right builds up society; the wrong tears it\ndown. One is social; the other anti-social (Malcolm J. McVeigh, 1974:\n84).\n\n\nIn the ethics of the Lovedu, a South Bantu ethnic group of the\nTransvaal:\n\n Right conduct is relative always to the human situation and\nmorality is oriented not from any absolute standards of honesty or\ntruth but from the social good in each situation. Conduct\nthat promotes smooth relationships, that upholds the social structure,\nis good; conduct that runs counter to smooth social relationships is\nbad (J. D. and E. J. Krige in Forde, 1954: 78). \n\n\nAnd, regarding the basis of Bantu morality, Molema remarked:\n\n The greatest happiness and good of the tribe was the end and aim of\neach member of the tribe. Now, utility forms part of the basis of\nperhaps all moral codes. With the Bantu, it formed the basis of\nmorality\u2026it was utilitarian.  This was the standard of\ngoodness, and in harmony with, and conformity to, this end must the\nmoral conduct be moulded. The effect of this, of course, was\naltruism (S.  M. Molema, 1920: 116). \n\n\nStatements and references made in the immediately foregoing\nparagraphs indicate the nonreligious foundation of African ethics. Now,\nhaving removed African ethics from its alleged religious moorings,\nwhere do we moor it? The answer, based on the foregoing references, is\nthat we moor it to the preoccupations of the African society with human\nwelfare and social harmony, to reflections on the existential\nconditions in which human beings function.\n\n\nNot being a revealed religion, traditional African religion can be\ncharacterized as a natural religion, a religion that derives from the\npeoples' own reflections on this complex world and their\nexperiences in it. The African metaphysic, to be sure, is a theistic\nmetaphysic; yet it does not nurture a theistic or supernatural ethic.\nJust as it was their own reflections that led to the creation of a\nnatural religion, so it was their own reflections on living a\nharmonious and cooperative life in a human society that led to the\ncreation of a \u2018natural\u2019 (a humanistic) ethic. Thus, side by\nside with Africa's natural religion (or, theology) is a\n\u2018natural\u2019 ethic grounded in human experiences in living\ntogether, a society-oriented morality that, thus, arises from the\nexistential conditions in which people conduct their lives. And so it\nis, that the moral values of the African people have a social and\nhumanistic, rather than a religious, basis and are fashioned according\nto the people's own understanding of the nature of human society,\nhuman relations, human goals, and the meaning of human life with its\nemotional features.\n\n\nWith all this said, however, it cannot be denied that religion plays\nsome role in the moral lives of people, such as African people, who\nare said to be \u201cincurably religious\u201d. Because God is held\nby the African people not only to be the overlord of the human society\nbut also to have a superbly moral character, and because the ancestors\n(ancestral spirits) are also supposed to be interested in the welfare\nof the society (they left behind), including the moral life of the\nindividual, religion constitutes part of the sanctions that are in\nplay in matters of moral practice. Thus, religion cannot be\ntotally banished from the domain of moral practice, notwithstanding\nthe fact that the moral values and principles of the African society\ndo not derive from religion.\n\n\nHumanism\u2014the doctrine that takes human welfare, interests, and\nneeds as fundamental\u2014constitutes the foundation of African ethics. It\nis the warp and woof the African moral life and thought. Indeed,\nAfrican prayers and other acts of worship are brimful of, or\ncharacterized by, requests to the supernatural beings for material\ncomforts, such as prosperity, health, and riches. And, even though the\nAfrican people do not consider God and other supernatural beings as the\nsources of their moral values and principles, nevertheless, they are\never aware of the powers of the supernatural beings and are ever ready\nto exploit their munificence for the promotion of human welfare,\nprosperity, and happiness.\n6. Humanity and Brotherhood\n\n\nThese two concepts, humanity and brotherhood, feature prominently in\nAfrican social and moral thought and practice. They are among the moral\nor human values that constitute the basic\u2014perhaps the\nultimate\u2014criteria that not only motivate but also justify human\nactions that affect other human beings. In African terms, humanity is\nnot just an anthropological term; it is also a moral term when it comes\nto considering the relations between members of the human species. The\nterm \u2018brotherhood\u2019 has come to refer to an association of\nmen and/or women with common aims and interests. But the notion of\nbrotherhood is essentially a moral notion, for it is about the\nrelations between individual human beings that make for their own\ninterest and well-being. There is some affiliation between humanity and\nbrotherhood in African ethical conceptions: if we are human, we are\n(must be) brothers, in a capacious, comprehensive sense of the word\n\u2018brother\u2019 (to be discussed shortly).\n\n\nWe start our discussion with the Akan maxim:\n\nHumanity has no boundary.\n(Honam mu nni nhanoa)\n\n\n\nThe Akan maxim literally means: \u2018In human flesh there is no\nedge of cultivation\u2014no boundary\u2019 (nhanoa). The\nmaxim can be interpreted as meaning that \u2018all humankind is one\nspecies\u2019, thus, that \u2018Humanity has no boundary.\u2019 When\nthe farmer cultivates his land, he does it up to a limit, an edge (in\nAkan: nhanoa, edge, boundary) where he has to stop, otherwise\nhe would trespass on another farmer's land. There is, thus, a\nlimit to the area of cultivation of land. But this, the maxim invites\nus to realize, is not so in the cultivation of the friendship and\nfellowship of human beings; the boundaries of that form of\ncultivation are limitless. For, humanity is of one kind; all humankind\nis one species, with shared basic values, feelings, hopes, and\ndesires.\n\n\nThis is most probably the reason why in almost all the autochthonous\nAfrican languages (here I exclude African languages, like Hausa and\nSwahili, that have borrowed a substantial number of Arabic words) there\nis really no word for \u2018race.\u2019 There are, instead, the words\n\u2018person\u2019, \u2018human being\u2019, and\n\u2018people.\u2019 So that, where others would speak in terms of\n\u2018the black race\u2019 or \u2018the white race\u2019, Africans\nwould say, \u2018black people\u2019, \u2018white people\u2019, and\nso on. And, instead of \u2018people of mixed race\u2019, they\nwould say, \u2018people of mixed blood.\u2019 The latter expression,\nhowever, is somewhat vague, since it also describes people of dual\nethnic parentage in African societies. But, in terms of the African\nperception of humanity, the important point is that the offspring of\nany \u2018blood mixing\u2019 is a human being and therefore belongs\nto the one human \u2018race\u2019 of which we are all a part. Thus,\neven though the African people traditionally live in small communities\nand are divided into different ethnic or cultural groups and into clans\nand lineages with complex networks of relationships, nevertheless, they\nperceive humanity to embrace all other peoples beyond their narrow\ngeographic or spatial confines, to constitute all human beings into one\nuniversal family of humankind. Even though this family is fragmented\ninto a multiplicity of peoples and cultures, nevertheless, it is a\nshared family\u2014a shared humanity\u2014the relationships among\nwhose members ought to feature a certain kind of morality: the morality\nof a shared humanity\n\n\nThe common membership of one universal human family constitutes\n(should constitute) a legitimate basis for the idea of universal human\nbrotherhood (or unity). This idea is depicted in, for instance, the\nAkan maxim:\n\nA human being's brother is a (or another) human being.\n (Or, \u2018Man's brother is man.\u2019)\n(Onipa nua ne onipa)\n\n\nThe maxim asserts unmistakably that a human being can be related\nonly to another human being, not to a\nbeast. Implicit in the African perception of humanity is the\nrecognition of all persons, irrespective of their racial or ethnic\nbackgrounds, as brothers. This is the reason why in African cultures\nthe word \u2018brother\u2019 is used to cover various and complex\nfamily relationships linked by blood ties. But the word is also used,\nsignificantly, by persons between whom there are no blood ties; thus,\nthe word is used comprehensively. The comprehensive meaning given to\nthe word \u2018brother\u2019 in African cultures is intended,\nindeed, to lift people up from the purely biologically determined\nblood relation level onto the human level, the level where the essence\nof humanity is held as transcending the contingencies of human\nbiology, race, ethnicity, or culture.\n\n\nA practical translation of the idea of brotherhood leads to such\nsocial and moral virtues as hospitality, generosity, concern for\nothers, and communal feeling. Several writers, including European\ntravelers to Africa in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,\nhave remarked upon these virtues as practiced in African social and\nmoral life. A Briton who spent about three decades in Central Africa\nfrom the latter part of the nineteenth century to the early part of the\ntwentieth century made the following observation:\n\nHospitality is one of the most sacred and ancient customs of\nBantuland, and is found everywhere. A native will give his\nbest house and his evening meal to a guest, without the slightest\nthought that he is doing anything extraordinary (Dugald\nCampbell, 1922: 45, emphasis added).\n\n\nAnd a contemporary African writer also notes:\n\nOne of the achievements of our [African] society was the universal\nhospitality on which they [i.e., members of the community and others]\ncould rely (Julius Nyerere, 1968: 5).\n\n\nMost people, including foreign visitors to Africa, often testify, in amazement, to\nthe ethic of hospitality and generosity of the\nAfrican people. That ethic is an expression of the perception of our\ncommon humanity and universal human brotherhood.\n\n\nAs regards the African conception of the worth and dignity of the\nhuman being, there is time to refer only to a couple of Akan maxims.\nOne such maxim is:\n\nThe human being is more beautiful than gold.\n(onipa ye fe sen sika)\n\n\nIn this maxim a human being is depicted as beautiful. That which is\nbeautiful is enjoyed for its own sake, not for the sake of anything\nelse. What the maxim is saying, therefore, is that a human being is to\nbe enjoyed for his or her own sake. To enjoy a human being for his/her\nown sake means you should appreciate his value as a human being and\ndemonstrate that appreciation by showing compassion, generosity, and\nhospitality. It means you should be open to the interests and welfare\nof others and feel it a moral duty to offer help where it is needed. To\nenjoy a human being also means you should recognize the other person as a\nfellow individual whose worth as a human being is equal to yours and\nwith whom you undoubtedly share basic values, ideals, and sentiments.\nThus, the main intent of the maxim is to point out the worth of a human\nbeing and the respect that ought to be given to her by virtue of her\nhumanity. Recognition of the worth of a human being is, according to\nthe maxim, more important than caring for wealth.\n\n\nKenneth Kaunda describes in some detail how the enjoyment of people\nis expressed in practical terms: \n\nOur conversation is a good example of this [enjoyment of people].  We\nwill talk for hours with any stranger who crosses our path and by the\ntime we part there will be little we do not know about each other. We\ndo not regard it as impertinence or an invasion of our privacy for\nsomeone to ask \u2018personal\u2019 questions, nor have we\ncompunction about questioning others in like manner. We are open to\nthe interests of other people. Our curiosity does not stem from a\ndesire to interfere in someone else's business but is an\nexpression of our belief that we are wrapped up together in this\nbundle of life and therefore a bond already exists between myself\nand a stranger before we open our mouths to talk (Kaunda, 1966:\n32). \n\n\nThe value of the human being is expressed also in the following\nmaxim:\n\nIt is the human being that counts: I call upon gold, it answers\nnot; I call upon cloth, it answers not; it is the human being that\ncounts.\n(Onipa ne asem: mefre sika a, sika nnye so, mefre ntama\na, ntama nnye so; onipa ne asem.)\n\n\n\nThe maxim says that it is only the human being that is of\nreal value, for in times of need or distress, if you appeal to gold and\nother material possessions they will not respond; only a human being\nwill. For these reasons, the worth of the human being is of the\nultimate consequence and ought therefore to be given the ultimate\nconsideration. From such maxims one can appreciate why human welfare\nand concern constitute the preoccupation of African ethics.\n7. The Notion of the Common Good\n\n\nThe notion of the common good features manifestly in African ethics.\nIn Akan moral thought, the notion is expressed most vividly in an art\nmotif that shows a \u2018siamese\u2019 crocodile with two heads but a\nsingle (i.e., common) stomach. The part of the motif\nrelevant to moral thought is the single stomach, and it is to the\nsignificance of this that I wish to pay some attention. The common\nstomach of the two crocodiles indicates that at least the basic\ninterests of all the members of the community are identical. It\ncan therefore be interpreted as symbolizing the common good,\nthe good of all the individuals within a society.\n\n\nThe common good is not a surrogate for the sum of the various\nindividual goods. It does not consist of, or derive from, the goods and\npreferences of particular individuals. It is that which is essentially\ngood for human beings as such, embracing the needs that are\nbasic to the enjoyment and fulfillment of the life of each\nindividual. If the common good were the aggregate of individual goods,\nit would only be contingently, not essentially, common and, on that\nscore, it would not be achieved in a way that will benefit all the\nindividuals in a society. If the common good is achieved, then the\nindividual good is also achieved. Thus, there should be no conceptual\ntension or opposition between the common good and the good of the\nindividual member of the community, for the common good embraces the\ngoods\u2014the basic goods\u2014of all the members of the community. If\nthe common good were understood as the basic good\u2014as human good\u2014as\nsuch, there would be no need to think of it as a threat to individual\nliberty as touted by Western liberal (individualist) thinkers, for,\nafter all, individual liberty is held as one of the basic goods of the\nmembers of the society. The contents of the common stomach, in the\nsymbolic art of the \u2018siamese crocodile\u2019, would not conflict\nwith the interests and needs of either of the crocodiles.\n\n\nThe good, as discussed in an earlier section, is defined by\nthe traditional thinkers of the Akan society in terms of peace,\nhappiness or satisfaction (human flourishing), justice, dignity,\nrespect, and so on. The common good embraces these goods and more.\n\n\nThere is no human being who does not desire peace, security,\nfreedom, dignity, respect, justice, equality, and satisfaction. It is\nsuch a moral, not a weird, notion embracive of fundamental\ngoods\u2014goods that are intrinsic to human fulfillment and to which\nall individuals desire to have access\u2014that is referred to as the\ncommon good. The unrelenting support by people in a community for such\nmoral values as social justice and equality on the one hand, and the\nspontaneous, universal denunciation of acts such as murder and cruelty\non the other hand, are certainly inspired by beliefs in the common\ngood.\n\n\nSimilarly, the institutions of various kinds\u2014legal, political,\neconomic, moral and others\u2014are set up in pursuit of certain\ncommonly shared values and goals, that is, a common good which a human\nsociety desires to achieve for all of its members. The\ninstitution of government or legal system is surely based on a common\nunderstanding of the need for societal values of social order and\nsocial peace. It is, thus, pretty clear that the common good is that\nwhich inspires the creation of a moral, social, political, or legal\nsystem for enhancing the well-being of people in a community.\n\n\nThe common good is a notion that is conceptually affiliated to the\nnotion of community and, thus, to the notion of human society as such.\nThe common good is an essential feature of the ethics espoused by the\ncommunitarian African society. The pursuit of the good of all is the\ngoal of the communitarian society, which the African society is. A\nsense of the common good\u2014which is a core of shared values\u2014is the\nunderlying presupposition of African social morality.\n8. Social, Not Individualistic, Ethics\n\n\nA humanistic morality, whose central focus is the concern for the\nwelfare and interest of each member of community, would expectably be a\nsocial morality which is enjoined by social life itself. Such\nis the nature of African morality. Social life or sociality is natural\nto the human being because every human being is born into an existing\nhuman society. A traditional Akan thinker asserted in a previously\nquoted proverb that says that \u2018When a human being descends from\nthe heavens, he [or she] descends into a human town [or, a human\nsociety].\u2019 The point of the maxim is that the human being is\nsocial by nature. This view finds a variant in Aristotle's\ncelebrated dictum that \u2018The human being is by nature a\nsocial animal\u2019, that is, that a human being is by nature a\nmember of a\npolis, a human community. [The word politikon used in\nAristotle's dictum means \u2018social\u2019 rather than\n\u2018political\u2019.] Being a member of the human community by\nnature, the individual is naturally related or oriented toward other\npersons and must have relationships with them. The natural sociality or\nrelationality of human beings would\u2014and should\u2014prescribe a\nsocial ethic, rather than the ethic of individualism. Individualistic\nethics that focuses on the welfare and interests of the individual is\nhardly regarded in African moral thought.\n\n\nAfrican social ethic is expressed in many maxims (or, proverbs) that\nemphasize the importance of the values of mutual helpfulness,\ncollective responsibility, cooperation, interdependence, and reciprocal\nobligations. Let me refer to a few of these, from the Akan\nrepertoire:\n\n The well-being of man depends on his fellow man.\n(onipa yieye firi onipa) \n\n\nThe point of this proverb is, not that a person should always look\nto another (or others) for his well-being and the attainment of his\ngoals, but that there are occasions when the demonstration by another\nperson (or other persons) of goodwill, sympathy, compassion, and the\nwillingness to help can be a great boost to a person's attempts\nto achieve his goals, to fulfill his life. The dependency noted in the\nforegoing proverb is to be put down to the limited nature of the\npossibilities of the human individual. Human limitations are in fact\nexpressed in the following Akan proverb:\n\nMan is not a palm-tree that he should be complete\n (or, self sufficient).\n(onipa nye abe na ne ho ahyia ne ho)\n\n\n\nThe proverb points up the inadequacies of the human being that make\nit impossible for him to fulfill his life, socially, economically,\nemotionally, psychologically, and so on. It is evidently true that in\nthe context of the society, in terms of functioning or flourishing in a\nhuman society, the human individual is not sufficient, for her\ncapacities, talents, and dispositions are not adequate for the\nrealization of her potential and basic needs. It is only through\ncooperation with other human beings that the needs and goals of the\nindividual can be fulfilled. With his self-sufficiency whittled away by\nman's natural condition, the individual requires the succor and\nrelationships of others in order to satisfy his basic needs. A social\nethic that recognizes the importance of the values of mutual help,\ngoodwill, and reciprocity is the kind of ethic that will counter the\nlack of human self-sufficiency in respect of talents and capacities and\nin many ways help realize his basic needs.\n\n\nReciprocity and interdependence are forthrightly expressed in the\nfollowing Akan maxims:\n\nThe right arm washes the left arm and the left arm\nwashes the right arm.\n(wo nsa nifa hohorow benkum, na benkum nso hohorow nifa)\n\n\n\nThat the left arm cannot wash itself is of course a matter of\neveryday experience. It is when the two arms wash each other that both\nbecome clean: thus, the need for interdependence.\n\nLife is mutual aid.\n(Obra ye nnoboa)\n\n\n\nThe Akan word nnoboa means \u2018helping each other to\nwork on the farm\u2019. In the farming communities of rural Ghana,\nwhen a farmer realizes that work on the farm cannot be completed within\na certain time if he did it single-handedly, he would request the\nassistance and support of other farmers in the community. The other\nfarmers would readily lend a helping hand to that farmer, who would, in\nthis way, achieve his productivity goals and do so on time. The same\nrequest would, when necessary, be made by the other farmers on\ndifferent occasions. It is this kind of experience that led an Akan\ntraditional thinker to create this proverb which, because of the word\n\u2018life\u2019 (obra), has been made to cover other\nspheres of the human life than the purely economic (or agricultural).\nRefusing to offer help to others and consistently seeking one's\nown good and disregarding the good of others will result in one's\nbeing denied the help and goodwill that may be necessary to achieve\ncertain ends. Since you refused to help someone who needed your help or\nsomeone who was in distress, you are likely to meet the same refusal or\ndenial when you need some help\u2014perhaps more help at that. The\nmorality of a shared life, as in any community, thus demands mutuality\nor reciprocity as a moral mandate in a world in which human beings,\nweak and limited in many ways, are subject to vulnerable\nsituations. Mutual aid, then, becomes a moral obligation.\n\n\nThat a human being, due to her limitations, deserved to be helped is\nexpressed in the following maxim:\n\nA human being needs help.\n(onipa hia moa)\n\n\nThe Akan word translated \u2018needs\u2019 is hia, which,\nas used in this maxim, has a normative  connotation; thus, it\ndoes more than simply expressing a fact about human life or the human\ncondition. The real meaning of the maxim, then, is that a human being\ndeserves, and therefore ought, to be helped. It also means that a human\nbeing must be regarded as an object of moral concern and should\ntherefore be entitled to help by others in the appropriate\ncircumstances. The reason why you should help someone in need is also\ngiven in the following maxim, among others:\n\n\n Your neighbor's situation is [potentially] your situation.\n(Wo yonko da ne wo da)\n\n\nTwo important things about this maxim need to be pointed out. One is\nthat the maxim is uttered in references only to the pitiable, miserable\nor unfortunate situation of another person (referred to in the maxim as\n\u201cyour neighbor\u201d\u2014wo yonko) or other people\n(your \u201cneighbors\u201d). These unfortunate situations or\ncircumstances insistently call for the demonstration of sympathy,\ncompassion, and willingness to offer some help. The other important\nthing about this maxim is that the word \u2018neighbor\u2019 in the\nmaxim does not necessarily refer to the person next door or in\none's community but to any other person in your\ncommunity and beyond: even in far-off places.\n\n\nThe basic or ultimate thrust of the maxim is that you should not\nshow insensitivity to people who are in pitiable situations, for one\nday you might be in that situation too and would need the help\nof others: thus, your neighbor's situation is potentially your\nsituation; every other person is basically you. Social morality thus\ndemands mutual reciprocity as a moral mandate in a world in which human\nbeings can easily be overcome\u2014even overwhelmed\u2014by the\ncontingencies of the human condition and existence. Altruism is, thus,\na fundamental moral value.\n\n\nInsensitivity to the needs and hardships or suffering situations of\nothers is repudiated in Akan morality, as it is, indeed, repudiated in\nthe moralities of all human cultures. In Akan moral thought and\npractice, a maxim that rebukes the lack of feeling for others is put\nthus:\n\nWhen it sticks into your neighbor's flesh,\nit is as if it stuck into a piece of wood.\n(etua wo yonko ho a, etua dua mu)\n\n\n\n\u201cSticking into your neighbor's flesh (or, body)\u201d is\nanother way of referring to the suffering, misfortune, hardship, or\npain of another person. When something, such as a needle, sticks into\nyour own flesh or body, you feel the pain. If it stuck into another\nperson's\u2014your neighbor's\u2014flesh, you would not directly\nfeel the pain. Even so, you should not feel insensitive to the pain or\nsuffering of that person and shrug off your moral shoulders, for the\nother person's body is certainly not a piece of wood that\ncannot feel pain.\n\n\nThe foregoing maxims and many others similar to them in content and\npurpose all underline a social morality. There are many African\nfolktales whose conclusions are intended to affirm the values of social\nmorality\u2014the kind of morality that is centered on human\nrelations. The social character of morality requires that the\nindividual member of the society, ever mindful of his interests, adjust\nthose interests to the interests and needs of others. This requires him\nto give due consideration to the interests and welfare of others.\nNecessarily embedded in a human community, the individual person has a\ndual moral responsibility: for him or herself as an individual\nand for others as co-members of the community with whom she shares\ncertain basic needs and interests.\n9. The Ethics of Duty, Not of Rights\n\n\nAfrican ethics, is a humanitarian ethics, the kind of ethics that\nplaces a great deal of emphasis on human welfare. The concern for\nhuman welfare may be said to constitute the hub of the African\naxiological wheel. This orientation of African ethics takes its\nimpulse, undoubtedly, from the humanistic outlook that characterizes\ntraditional African life and thought. Humanism\u2014the doctrine that\nsees human needs and interests as fundamental\u2014thus constitutes\nthe foundation of African ethics (see section 5 above).\n\n\nNow, the natural sociality or relationality of the human being that\nwould prescribe social ethic (see preceding section) would also\nprescribe the ethic of duty (or, responsibility). The natural\nrelationality of the individual immediately involves one in some social\nand moral roles in the form of obligations, commitments, and duties\n(or, responsibilities) to other members of his or her community which\nthe individual must fulfill. Social or community life itself, a robust\nfeature of the African communitarian society, mandates a morality that\nclearly is weighted on duty to others and to the community; it\nconstitutes the foundation for moral responsibilities and\nobligations.\n\n\nThere appears to be a conceptual tie\u2014perhaps also a practical\ntie\u2014between the social ethic prescribed by the communitarian\nethos and the ethic of duty mandated by the same ethos.\n\n\nA morality of duty is one that requires each individual to\ndemonstrate concern for the interests of others. The ethical values of\ncompassion, solidarity, reciprocity, cooperation, interdependence, and\nsocial well-being, which are counted among the principles of the\ncommunitarian morality, primarily impose duties on the individual with\nrespect to the community and its members. All these considerations\nelevate the notion of duties to a status similar to that given to the\nnotion of rights in Western ethics. African ethics does not give\nshort-shrift to rights as such; nevertheless, it does not give\nobsessional or blinkered emphasis on rights. In this morality duties\ntrump rights, not the other way around, as it is in the moral systems\nof Western societies. The attitude to, or performance of, duties is\ninduced by a consciousness of needs rather than of rights. In other\nwords, people fulfill\u2014and ought to fulfill\u2014duties to others not\nbecause of the rights of these others, but because of their needs and\nwelfare\n\n\nIt would be clear from the foregoing discussion that African ethics\ntakes a stand that would be against what are referred to as acts of\nsupererogation. A supererogatory act is defined as an act that is said\nto be \u2018beyond the call of duty\u2019; it is an act that is said\nto be over and above what a person is required to do as a moral agent.\nIn much of the literature on Western moral philosophy, an act of\nsupererogation is held not as a strictly moral duty. Thus, it\nis neither morally obligatory nor forbidden; therefore, it is not\nwrong, so the argument concludes, to omit or neglect performing it,\neven though it is good and commendable by virtue of its value and\nconsequences on others if it is performed. It is supposed to be a\nmeritorious act and yet optional, one that may be performed if the\nspirit moves you, but need not be performed. Thus, a distinction is\nmade in Western literature between moral duty and a supererogatory act,\nthe former considered obligatory and moral duty \u2018proper\u2019\nand the latter nonobligatory and optional, not being a\n\u2018proper\u2019 moral duty.\n\n\nSupererogationism is clearly an oxymoron: for, why should an act\nthat is good and morally commendable and will conduce to the well-being\nof another person (or, other persons) fail to exact obligation or\ncompel performance? We would normally think that there is a moral\nconnection between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019, and that\ntherefore a morally good act ought to be performed: if an act is\nmorally good, then it ought to be performed.\n\n\nAfrican morality, which is humanitarian, social, and duty-oriented\nrather than rights-oriented morality, does not make a distinction\nbetween a moral duty and a supererogatory duty\u2014one that is beyond\nthe call of duty and so does not have to be performed. In the light of\nour common humanity, it would not be appropriate\u2014in fact it would\ndemean our humanity\u2014to place limits to our moral duties or\nresponsibilities. Even though it is true that, as human beings, we are\nlimited in many ways and so are not capable of fulfilling our moral\nduties to all human beings at all times as such, nevertheless, the\nscope of our moral duties should not be circumscribed. African\nhumanitarian ethics would seek to collapse moral duty and moral\nideals\u2014the latter being the basis of the so-called supererogatory\nduty\u2014into one capacious moral universe inhabited both by the\nmorality of duty \u2018proper\u2019, obligation, and justice\nand the morality of love, virtue, compassion, benevolence, and\nother \u201cmoral ideals\u201d. Such a capacious morality would make\nno distinction between a morally obligatory act and a morally optional\nact. It would insist that no act that is morally good in itself or that\nwill conduce to the well-being of some individual or group of\nindividuals should be considered morally optional, to be morally\nshrugged off or unconscionably set aside, if we understand morality to\nbe something that serves (or, should) serve human needs. Thus, as the\nsecond part of a previous quotation says,\n\n\nA native will give his best house and his evening meal to a\nguest, without the slightest thought that he is doing anything\nextraordinary (Dugald Campbell, section 6 above).\n\n\n\n\nThus, African ethics\u2014an ethics that is weighted on duty, not on\nrights\u2014would, in principle, not consider moral duty of any kind\nas extraordinary, optional, or supererogatory. The African humanitarian\nethic makes all people objects of moral concern, implying that our\nmoral sensitivities should be extended to all people, irrespective of\ntheir cultures or societies.\n10. Conclusion\n\n\nAfrican morality is founded on humanism, the doctrine that considers\nhuman interests and welfare as basic to the thought and action of the\npeople. It is this doctrine as understood in African moral thought\nthat has given rise to the communitarian ethos of the African\nsociety. For, ensuring the welfare and interests of each member of\nsociety can hardly be accomplished outside the communitarian society.\nThe communitarian ethos is also borne of beliefs about the natural\nsociality of the human being, expressed, for instance, in the Akan\nmaxim, previously referred to, that says that \u201cwhen a human\nbeing descends from the heavens, he descends into a human\ntown\u201d(onipa firi soro besi a, obesi onipa\nkurom). Social or community life is, thus, not optional to the\nhuman being. Social life, which follows upon our natural sociality,\nimplicates the individual in a web of moral obligations, commitments,\nand duties to be fulfilled in pursuit of the common good or the\ngeneral welfare.\n\n\nThus, African humanitarian ethics spawns social morality, the\nmorality of the common good, and the morality of duty that is so\ncomprehensive as to bring within its compass what are referred to as\nmoral ideals (such as love, virtue, compassion), which are considered \nsupererogatory in Western ethics. But central or basic\nto the African morality is character, for the success of the moral life\nis held to be a function of the quality of an individual's\npersonal life. A moral conception of personhood is held in African\nethics, the conception that there are certain basic moral norms and\nideals to which the conduct of the individual human being, if he is a\nperson, ought to conform. The recognition in the African ethical\ntraditions of all human beings as brothers by reason of our common\nhumanity is indeed a lofty moral ideal that must be cherished and made\na vital or robust feature of global ethics in our contemporary world.\nIt is a bulwark against developing bigoted attitudes toward peoples of\ndifferent cultures or skin colors who are, also, members of the\nuniversal human family called race.\n",
