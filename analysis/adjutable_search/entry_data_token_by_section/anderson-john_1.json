Outline of Anderson\u2019s Philosophy\n\nThe emphasis of Anderson\u2019s realism is upon\nindependence, directed particularly at the notion of\nconstitutive relations (which he takes to be the central error of\nidealism), but also employed in qualifying reductivist and\ninstrumentalist forms of scientific explanation. His position is that\nalthough whatever exists has relations and is conditioned, it is\nnonetheless a specific existing thing with qualities of its own. It is\nthe aim of critical inquiry in any given field to identify relevant\nqualities and characteristics and to state the issue in the form of\nobjective and communicable truth. Whatever our interests draw our\nattention to, the truth of the matter is independent of our\nconsideration. Whatever innovative and imaginative uses we make of\nparticular things, those uses are available to us because of existing\nproperties in the things themselves. For Anderson, two aspects of\nphilosophical speculation have been linked throughout the history of\nthe subject, and his own thought can be considered as a single system\nwith these complementary aspects: the logical and the ethical.\n\nFirst, there is a single way of being, that of ordinary things\nbehaving in ordinary ways in space and time. All theories of higher\nand lower realities can only be stated in terms of the common reality\nwe all know and share. Anderson applied this thesis across the board:\nthere are not different kinds or degrees of truth, only\nsomething\u2019s being the case or not; universals and values do not\nexist above the world of space and time in a transcendent sphere of\noperation; powers are not entities distinct from the processes they\nexplain; the mental realm cannot be conceived as operating in a sphere\nseparate from or other than space and time. There is no absolute or\nlogical distinction between universals and particulars \u2013\nuniversals exist within the ordinary world, but never apart from the\nparticulars they describe; that is, there is no ontological level\nabove or below that of the state of affairs or the fact of a\npredicated subject. As the study of the formal features of facts,\nlogic provides an account of what is objectively real: logic entails a\ngeneral ontology.\n\nSecond, Anderson emphasised both the objective and subjective\ndifficulties inherent in the endeavour to see things as they are, and\nthe necessary discipline acquired in ongoing traditions of critical\ninquiry. Confronting the reality of our existence entails recognising\nand not turning away from the ubiquity of conflict, tension and strife\nin all spheres. For Anderson ethical goods exist in the world in such\nactivities as intellectual inquiry, artistic production and scientific\ninvestigation. Ethical investigation is primarily concerned with\nidentifying those human activities which are driven by internal\nstandards of correctness and value and not by concern for external\nrewards or utilities. But these activities exist perilously in a world\nseriously inclined towards stasis and corruption. There is an almost\ntheological depth to Anderson\u2019s pessimism in this regard. \n\nAnderson\u2019s views in normative philosophy are outlined in\nwritings in ethical inquiry, narrowly construed, aesthetics, political\nthought and educational philosophy. Ethics is the study of\nthe real qualities of human activities, not of what is right or\nobligatory, these latter questions being relegated to the study of\ncustomary norms and expectations arising from particular practices and\nways of life. Similarly, aesthetics is the study of the\nqualities of beautiful things, and is neither a study of feelings,\nexpressions or judgments, nor a source of directives for artists. A\nwork of art succeeds to the extent that it objectively portrays its\ntheme, accounts for what is the case (for example, anger\nconsidered as the \u201ctheme\u201d of The Iliad). Literary\ncriticism consists in assessing whether the artist has succeeded,\nobjectively, in capturing or portraying the chosen theme. In his\nsocial and political thought, Anderson holds that society is\na complex of competing and cooperating movements neither united by\ninclusive social purpose, nor reducible to its individual members.\n\nUnderlying both logical and ethical aspects of Anderson\u2019s\nthought is the identification of systematic confusions and errors in\nphilosophical thought. One persistent confusion is the\nmisidentification of relations as qualities. Most commonly, being in\nsome relation is thought to constitute the \u201cnature\u201d of\nsome special status entity. But whereas a term together with a quality\nis a complete unit just as it stands, a term and a relation is simply\nincomplete without a second term. Anderson applied this thesis widely:\nthere are no such things whose nature it is to be known or perceived\n(\u201cideas\u201d); there is no such thing whose nature it is to\nknow (\u201cconsciousness\u201d); there are no such things whose\nnature it is to be pursued or whose nature it is to direct action\n(\u201cvalues\u201d conceived as standing over and above the goods\nand values of this life). Relations are often more evident to us than\nthe underlying qualities of the things related and so relational\nexplanations suggest themselves to us quite naturally. On the other\nhand, significant intellectual effort is required in any given field\nto understand the illusory nature of such explanations and the manner\nin which they obstruct the identification and assertion of real\nissues.\n\nAccording to Anderson, one central confusion infecting modern\nphilosophy since Descartes has been its obsession with epistemological\nquestions, the attempt to provide unshakeable foundations for our\nknowledge of the external world. There is no gap between mind and\nworld that needs to be bridged because mentality belongs to the\nspatio-temporal world along with everything else. This is not to say\nthat misunderstanding is impossible, just that understanding is\npossible. It is possible to know various conditions and characters of\nthings in the first place only because things have these\ncharacters independently of our inquiries. And since as knowers we\noccupy the single world of space and time we come under the same\nconditions and so come into relations with those things that we are\ninvestigating. All knowledge depends upon empirical investigation and\nso is fallible: it is not built upon any more immediate or reliable\nentities such as sense data or self-evident ideas. Epistemological and\nontological bedrock is the complex situation of being there and\nso, a particular\u2019s being of a certain kind. Knowing minds\nare themselves complex spatio-temporal things, societies of emotions\nand feelings without a unifying consciousness to which these might\nbelong nor some ultimate self which could conceivably take a stand\nsomehow outside and beyond the world of space and time. Modern\nphilosophy\u2019s epistemological obsession can be regarded as an\nillogical attempt to look behind the proposition, to gain a sideways\nview of how our propositions hook up to the real world.\n",
