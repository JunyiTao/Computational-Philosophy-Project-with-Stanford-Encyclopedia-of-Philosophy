    "main_text": "Versions of the Coherence Theory of Truth\n1. Versions of the Coherence Theory of Truth\n\n\nThe coherence theory of truth has several versions. These versions\ndiffer on two major issues. Different versions of the theory give\ndifferent accounts of the coherence relation. Different varieties of\nthe theory also give various accounts of the set (or sets) of\npropositions with which true propositions cohere. (Such\na set will be called a specified set.) \n\n\nAccording to some early versions of the coherence theory, the\ncoherence relation is simply consistency. On this view, to say that a\nproposition coheres with a specified set of propositions is to say that\nthe proposition is consistent with the set. This account of coherence\nis unsatisfactory for the following reason. Consider two propositions\nwhich do not belong to a specified set. These propositions could both\nbe consistent with a specified set and yet be inconsistent with each\nother. If coherence is consistency, the coherence theorist would have\nto claim that both propositions are true, but this is impossible.\n\n\nA more plausible version of the coherence theory states that the\ncoherence relation is some form of entailment. Entailment can be\nunderstood here as strict logical entailment, or entailment in some\nlooser sense. According to this version, a proposition coheres with a\nset of propositions if and only if it is entailed by members of the\nset. Another more plausible version of the theory, held for example in\nBradley (1914), is that coherence is mutual explanatory support\nbetween propositions.\n\n\nThe second point on which coherence theorists (coherentists, for\nshort) differ is the constitution of the specified set of propositions.\nCoherentists generally agree that the specified set consists of\npropositions believed or held to be true. They differ on the questions\nof who believes the propositions and when. At one extreme, coherence\ntheorists can hold that the specified set of propositions is the\nlargest consistent set of propositions currently believed by actual\npeople. For such a version of the theory, see Young (1995). According\nto a moderate position, the specified set consists of those\npropositions which will be believed when people like us (with finite\ncognitive capacities) have reached some limit of inquiry. For such a\ncoherence theory, see Putnam (1981). At the other extreme, coherence\ntheorists can maintain that the specified set contains the propositions\nwhich would be believed by an omniscient being. Some idealists seem to\naccept this account of the specified set.\n\n\nIf the specified set is a set actually believed, or even a set which\nwould be believed by people like us at some limit of inquiry,\ncoherentism involves the rejection of realism about truth. Realism\nabout truth involves acceptance of the principle of bivalence\n(according to which every proposition is either true or false) and the\nprinciple of transcendence (which says that a proposition may be true\neven though it cannot be known to be true). Coherentists who do not\nbelieve that the specified set is the set of propositions believed by\nan omniscient being are committed to rejection of the principle of\nbivalence since it is not the case that for every proposition either it\nor a contrary proposition coheres with the specified set. They reject\nthe principle of transcendence since, if a proposition coheres with a\nset of beliefs, it can be known to cohere with the set.\n",
