    "preamble": "\n\nPropositional logic is the study of the meanings of, and the\ninferential relationships that hold among, sentences based on the role\nthat a specific class of logical operators called the propositional\nconnectives have in determining those sentences\u2019 truth or\nassertability conditions. As early as Aristotle it was observed that\npropositional connectives have a logical significance, and over many\ncenturies piecemeal observations about some of their properties were\nmade. But propositional logic per se did not emerge until the\nnineteenth century with the appreciation of the value of studying the\nbehavior of propositional connectives in isolation of other\noperators.\n\nFor example, a variation of the famous canonical syllogism where A is\nthe sentence \u201cAll men are mortal, and Socrates is a man\u201d,\nand B is the sentence \u201cSocrates is mortal\u201d can give rise\nto a plurality of questions about the relationship between A and B.\nWhether B follows logically from A ought not depend, it is thought, on\nwhat words like \u201cmortal\u201d or \u201cman\u201d mean. But\none could reasonably ask either of the questions, \n\n\nDoes B follow from A purely by virtue of the meaning of the words\n\u201cand\u201d, \u201cis\u201d, \u201care\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, and \u201ca\u201d? \n\n\nand \n\n\nDoes B follow from A purely by virtue of the meaning of the word\n\u201cand\u201d? \n\n\nIntuitively, the answer to the first question is \u201cyes\u201d,\nand the answer to the second question is \u201cno\u201d.\n\nThe example suggests that there is a right way to ask the question,\nfor surely B does follow logically from A. So when we want to ask if a\nsentence follows logically, we should attend to the role of all words\nsuch as \u201cand\u201d, \u201cis\u201d, \u201care\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, and \u201ca\u201d. Consider, however, if C is the\nsentence \u201cAll men are mortal\u201d and D is the sentence\n\u201cSocrates is a man\u201d, that C also follows from A, but the\nmeanings of the words \u201cis\u201d, \u201care\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, and \u201ca\u201d play no role in the intuitive\nverification of that fact. (Because A is just the sentence \u201cC\nand D\u201d, nothing beyond an understanding of the meaning of the\nword \u201cand\u201d is needed to see that A cannot be true without\nC also being true.) It seems significant that B and C not only each\nfollow from A, but that they do so in different ways. The inference\nfrom A to C is not only simpler or more direct than the inference to\nB. In whatever sense B follows from A, so too does C, whereas there is\na stricter sense in which C, but not B, follows from A: Although both\nB and C follow \u201clogically\u201d from A, the logical bond\nbetween C and A is stronger than that between B and A. This highlights\nthe importance, not just of determinations about whether one sentence\nfollows from another, but of what standard of logicality underwrites\nthat determination.\n\nPropositional logic is the study of just such a specification of a\nstandard of logicality, wherein only the meanings of the propositional\nconnectives (e.g., \u201cand\u201d in the example above, but not\n\u201cis\u201d, \u201call\u201d, etc.) are considered in\nevaluating things such as the cogency of a deduction or a\nsentence\u2019s truth conditions.\n\nA sentential connective is a linguistic particle that binds sentences\nto create a new compound sentence or that inflects a single sentence\nto create a new sentence. Among the sentential connectives, a\npropositional connective has the characteristic feature that when the\noriginal sentences it operates on are (or express) propositions, the\nnew sentence that results from its application also is (or expresses)\na proposition. There are, as one would expect, many competing theories\nabout what a proposition is, and propositional logic originated as a\nscientific discipline independent of that debate. For this reason, the\nprecise demarcation of which linguistic particles qualify as\npropositional connectives is somewhat vague and even contentious. But\nthe general heuristic is that a propositional connective must create\nfrom some original sentences a new sentence that makes a claim of the\nsame order. Intuitively, because \u201cA and B\u201d is just an\naffirmation of the content of A and the content of B, and \u201cnot\nA\u201d is just a denial of the content of A, \u201cand\u201d and\n\u201cnot\u201d are serving as propositional connectives. \u201cIt\nis necessary that A\u201d, on the other hand, is a claim not about\nthe content of A but about the sentence A itself. Similarly, \u201cA\nimplies B\u201d is a claim about the sentences A and B, that they\nstand in an implication relationship with one another, rather than a\nclaim about the sort of thing that A and B themselves are claims\nabout. For this reason, the necessity qualifier and the implication\nrelation are typically not thought of as propositional connectives but\nas modal operators. The conditional operator in such expressions as\n\u201cIf A, then B\u201d has not received a consensus: On some\nanalyses, this has been treated as a propositional connective, but on\nothers it cannot be.\n\nIn presenting propositional logic, we will not assume any particular\ntheory of propositions. As we will see, the development of and\nplurality of systems of propositional logic can only be appreciated\nwhen no particular conception of proposition is in place. The only\nstipulations are that the connectives operate always on whole\nsentences and never on sub-sentential items like predicates or terms,\nand that they create sentences in the same evaluation class as the\nones they operate on, never higher-order expressions about the\nsentences in that class.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Basic Framework\n\nThe formal language of propositional logic consists of\n\u201catomic\u201d propositional variables, \\(p_1\\), \\(p_2\\),\n\\(p_3\\), \u2026, and propositional connectives, \\(c_1^1\\),\n\\(c_2^1\\), \\(c_3^1\\), \u2026, \\(c_1^2\\), \\(c_2^2\\), \\(c_3^2\\),\n\u2026, \\(c_1^3\\), \u2026. The expressions\u2019 subscripts are\nused to distinguish them from one another; the fact that we use\nnatural numbers indicates the typical convention that the vocabulary\nbe countable. The propositional connectives\u2019 superscripts\nindicate their \u201carity\u201d, i.e., the number of propositions\nthat they operate on in order to create a new proposition. The\nformulas of propositional logic are defined recursively by\n\n\n\nAtomic propositional variables are formulas.\n\n\nIf \\(c_n^m\\) is a propositional connective, and \\(\\langle\\)A, B, C,\n\u2026\\(\\rangle\\) is a sequence of m, possibly but not\nnecessarily atomic, possibly but not necessarily distinct, formulas,\nthen the result of applying \\(c_n^m\\) to \\(\\langle\\)A, B, C,\n\u2026\\(\\rangle\\) is a formula.\n\n\nThe result of applying \\(c_n^m\\) to \\(\\langle\\)A, B, C,\n\u2026\\(\\rangle\\) is customarily written in functional notation:\n\\(c_n^m\\)(A, B, C, \u2026). Examples of formulas are\n\n\n\n\\(p_4\\)\n\n\n\\(c_1^2(p_7, p_3)\\)\n\n\n\\(c_2^2(c_1^1(p_1), c_1^1(c_1^2(p_2, p_3)))\\)\n\n\n\\(c_5^3(p_2, c_3^2(c_4^1(c_6^2(p_3, p_3)), p_5),\nc_9^1(p_2))\\)\n\n\nThis recursive definition of the formulas of propositional logic\njustifies the use of the label \u201catomic\u201d for the\npropositional variables: Every formula is built up stepwise from atoms\nthrough a finite application of propositional connectives. It can be\nhelpful to think of the connectives as \u201cpropositional\nfunctions\u201d that take propositions (denoted by formulas) as input\nand return propositions as output. The space of propositions is then\ngiven as the free algebra on the atomic formulas generated by these\nfunctions, and the specification of a proposition is given by the\nstandard \u201ccomposition of functions\u201d notation. This\nterminology is not common, however, because the expression\n\u201cpropositional function\u201d has a quite different use of high\ncurrency (see the entry on\n Bertrand Russell).\n\nIt is customary to indicate the specific connectives one is studying\nwith special characters, typically \\(\\wedge\\), \\(\\vee\\), \\(\\supset\\),\n\\(\\neg\\), to use infix notation for binary connectives, and to display\nparentheses only when there would otherwise be ambiguity. It is also\ncommon to investigate properties of propositional formulas that do not\ndepend on the the occurrence of atoms fundamentally, in which case\nformula variables A, B, C, etc. appear in the expression in place of\nsentence letters. Thus if \\(c_1^1\\) is relabeled \\(\\neg\\), \\(c_1^2\\)\nis relabeled \\(\\wedge\\), and \\(c_2^2\\) is relabeled \\(\\vee\\), then in\nplace of the\n third formula\n listed above one would write \\(\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg(\\rB\\wedge\\rC)\\).\n2. The Classical Interpretation\n\nThe logical analysis of propositional formulas proceeds from an\nassociation of some meaning with the connectives, and there are\nseveral ways of doing this. Because the original motivation for\nstudying propositional logic is the observation that some particles in\nnatural language often behave like propositional connectives, a\nnatural first move is to try to specify formal rules of inference or\nprecise assertability conditions that capture or approximate the role\nthat these natural language predicates serve in informal reasoning.\nTwo of the earliest specifications were in terms of truth functions\nand in terms of axiomatic deduction systems. After considering these\nin turn, we will compare the more sophisticated specifications given\nby Gentzen\u2019s calculi.\n2.1 Truth-functionality\n\nIf \\(\\calV\\) is a set of truth values, a function\n\\(\\calV^n\\longrightarrow\\calV\\) mapping n-tuples of truth\nvalues to truth values is called an n-ary truth function. The\nnumber of values in \\(\\calV\\) is called the valence of the function\nspace. In the bivalent case, the truth values are denoted \\(\\bT\\) and\n\\(\\bF\\), and one has the classical theory of truth. Observe that in\nthis classical function space are two 0-ary truth functions which,\nfollowing the conventions on indices for propositional connectives we\ncould denote \\(f_1^0\\) and \\(f_2^0\\), but are conventionally denoted\n\\(\\top\\) and \\(\\bot\\), defined by \\(\\top=\\bT\\) and \\(\\bot=\\bF\\), and\nfour unary truth functions defined by \n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_1^1(\\bT)&=f_1^1(\\bF)=\\bT,\\\\\nf_2^1(\\bT) &=\\bT, \\\\\nf_2^1(\\bF) &=\\bF, \\\\\nf_3^1(\\bT) &=\\bF, \\\\\nf_3^1(\\bF) &=\\bT, \\\\\nf_4^1(\\bT) &=f_4^1(\\bF)=\\bF. \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nOne sees that \\(f_1^1\\) performs no operation on its input and is\nessentially the same as \\(\\top\\). \\(f_4^1\\) is similarly an impostor:\n\\(\\bot\\) dressed up as a unary function. One can quickly check that\nthe number of n-ary truth functions is \\(2^{2^n}\\)\u2014there\nbeing 2 possible output values on each of the \\(2^n\\) possible\nn-tuples of input values, and that at each stage, a number of\ntruth functions are impostors from lower arity. A case of special\ninterest are the sixteen binary truth functions, which one can fully\nindividuate by specifying their range on the 4 possible input\nvalues:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\ninput\n\\(\\langle\\bT, \\bT\\rangle\\)\n\\(\\langle\\bT, \\bF\\rangle\\)\n\\(\\langle\\bF, \\bT\\rangle\\)\n\\(\\langle\\bF, \\bF\\rangle\\)  \n\n\n\\(f_1^2\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\) \n\n\\(f_2^2\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\) \n\n\\(f_3^2\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\) \n\n\\(f_4^2\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\) \n\n\\(f_5^2\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\) \n\n\\(f_6^2\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\) \n\n\\(f_7^2\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\) \n\n\\(f_8^2\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\) \n\n\\(f_9^2\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\) \n\n\\(f_{10}^2\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\) \n\n\\(f_{11}^2\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\) \n\n\\(f_{12}^2\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\) \n\n\\(f_{13}^2\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bT\\) \n\n\\(f_{14}^2\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\)\n\\(\\bF\\) \n\n\\(f_{15}^2\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bT\\) \n\n\\(f_{16}^2\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)\n\\(\\bF\\)  \n\n\n\nOne immediately recognizes the impostors \\(f_1^2 = \\top\\), \\(f_4^2 =\nf_2^1\\) acting on the first input value, \\(f_6^2 = f_2^1\\) acting on\nthe second input value, \\(f_{11}^2 = f_3^1\\) acting on the second\ninput value, \\(f_{13}^2 = f_3^1\\) action on the first value, and\n\\(f_{16}^2 = \\bot\\), leaving ten essentially new binary truth\nfunctions.\n\nThe truth-functional analysis of propositional logic proceeds by\nassociating n-ary truth functions with the n-ary\npropositional connectives. The classical case considered thus far,\nwhere the truth value space is bivalent, admits a strikingly simple\nanalysis. Observe first that the functions \\(f_1^3\\), \\(f_2^2\\), and\n\\(f_2^8\\) approximate the truth conditions of some uses of the natural\nlanguage particles \u201cnot\u201d, \u201cor\u201d, and\n\u201cand\u201d (another use of the particle \u201cor\u201d is\narguably approximated by \\(f_2^7\\)). Thus if we associate these\nfunctions with the three connectives labeled earlier \\(\\neg\\),\n\\(\\vee\\), and \\(\\wedge\\), we could compute the truth value of complex\nformulas such as \\(\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg(\\rB\\wedge\\rC)\\) given different\npossible assignments of truth values to the sentence letters A, B, and\nC, according to the composition of functions indicated in the\nformula\u2019s propositional structure. One can check that this\nformula takes the value F precisely when each of A,\nB, and C is assigned T and takes the value\nT otherwise. Under this interpretation, one can\ndefine\n\n\n\nA is a classical propositional validity if it\nevaluates as T on every possible assignment of values\nto its atomic propositional variables;\n\n\nA is classically satisfiable if it evaluates as\nT on at least one possible assignment of values to\nits atomic propositional variables (and is classically\nunsatisfiable otherwise);\n\n\nA is a classical propositional consequence of B if on\nno assignment of values to the atoms that occur in A and B on which B,\nevaluates as T does A evaluate as\nF;\n\n\nA is a classical propositional equivalent of B if A\nand B evaluate as T on precisely the same assignments\nof values to atoms.\n\n\nIn this way, the language of propositional logic restricted to the\nconnectives \\(\\neg\\), \\(\\vee\\), and \\(\\wedge\\) corresponds with the\nformulas of the familiar two element Boolean algebra of\ncomplementation, union, and intersection. The familiar Boolean laws\nof\n\n\n\ninterchange:\n\nIf A and B are equivalent, and A occurs as a subformula of \\(\\rC_1\\),\nthen the result of replacing an occurrence of A in \\(\\rC_1\\) with B is\na formula \\(\\rC_2\\) that is equivalent to \\(\\rC_1\\).\n\n\nsubstitution:\n\nIf A and \\(\\rB_1\\) and \\(\\rC_1\\) are any formulas whatsoever, then the\nresult of replacing each occurrence of the propositional\nvariable \\(p\\) in \\(\\rB_1\\) and \\(\\rC_1\\) with A are formulas\n\\(\\rB_2\\) and \\(\\rC_2\\) with the properties: \\(\\rB_2\\) is valid if\n\\(\\rB_1\\) is; \\(\\rB_2\\) is unsatisfiable if \\(\\rB_1\\) is; \\(\\rB_2\\) is\na consequence of \\(\\rC_2\\) if \\(\\rB_1\\) is a consequence of \\(\\rC_1\\);\n\\(\\rB_2\\) and \\(\\rC_2\\) are equivalent if \\(\\rB_1\\) and \\(\\rC_1\\)\nare.\n\n\ncomplementation:\n\n\\(\\rA\\vee\\neg\\rA\\) is a classical validity (called the \u201claw of\nexcluded middle\u201d (lem) in propositional\nlogic).\n\n\ndouble complementation:\n\n\\(\\neg\\neg\\rA\\) is equivalent to A.\n\n\ncommutativity:\n\n\\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\) is equivalent to \\(\\rB\\wedge\\rA\\), and \\(\\rA\\vee\\rB\\)\nis equivalent to \\(\\rB\\vee\\rA\\).\n\n\nassociativity:\n\n\\((\\rA\\wedge\\rB)\\wedge\\rC\\) is equivalent to \\(\\rA\\wedge\n(\\rB\\wedge\\rC)\\), and \\((\\rA\\vee\\rB)\\vee\\rC\\) is equivalent to\n\\(\\rA\\vee (\\rB\\vee\\rC)\\).\n\n\ndistribution:\n\n\\(\\rA\\vee (\\rB_1\\wedge\\rB_2\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge\\rB_n)\\) is equivalent\nto \\((\\rA\\vee\\rB_1)\\wedge (\\rA\\vee\\rB_2)\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge\n(\\rA\\vee\\rB_n)\\) and\n\n\\(\\rA\\wedge (\\rB_1\\vee\\rB_2\\vee \\ldots \\vee\\rB_n)\\) is equivalent to\n\\((\\rA\\wedge\\rB_1)\\vee (\\rA\\wedge\\rB_2)\\vee \\ldots \\vee\n(\\rA\\wedge\\rB_n)\\).\n\n\nDe Morgan equivalence:\n\n\\(\\neg(\\rB_1\\wedge\\rB_2\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge\\rB_n)\\) is equivalent to\n\\(\\neg\\rB_1\\vee\\neg\\rB_2\\vee \\ldots \\vee\\neg\\rB_n\\) and\n\n\\(\\neg(\\rB_1\\vee\\rB_2\\vee \\ldots \\vee\\rB_n)\\) is equivalent to\n\\(\\neg\\rB_1\\wedge\\neg\\rB_2\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge\\neg\\rB_n\\).\n\n\ntherefore apply to this language of \u201cBoolean propositional\nformulas\u201d.\n2.1.1 Normal forms\n\nConsider any other propositional connective denoted \\(\\star\\), of any\narity, say 3, and suppose that with it too is associated an arity-3\ntruth function. As before let us specify this truth function by\nindicating its output on each of the \\(2^3\\) possible input\nvalues.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\ninput\n\\(\\star\\)  \n\n\n\\(\\langle\\)T, T,\nT\\(\\rangle\\)\nT \n\n\\(\\langle\\)T, T,\nF\\(\\rangle\\)\nT \n\n\\(\\langle\\)T, F,\nT\\(\\rangle\\)\nF \n\n\\(\\langle\\)T, F,\nF\\(\\rangle\\)\nF \n\n\\(\\langle\\)F, T,\nT\\(\\rangle\\)\nF \n\n\\(\\langle\\)F, T,\nF\\(\\rangle\\)\nT \n\n\\(\\langle\\)F, F,\nT\\(\\rangle\\)\nF \n\n\\(\\langle\\)F, F,\nF\\(\\rangle\\)\nF  \n\n\n\nThere is a simple algorithm for constructing a Boolean formula that is\nequivalent to \\(\\star\\)(A, B, C): For each row of the defining table\nfor \\(\\star\\) in which the output value is T,\nconstruct a conjunction of each propositional variable that is\nassigned T and the negation of each propositional\nvariable that is assigned F in that row\u2019s\ninput: in our case, \\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\wedge\\rC\\) from row 1,\n\\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\wedge\\neg\\rC\\) from row 2, and\n\\(\\neg\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\wedge\\neg\\rC\\) from row 3. Then disjoin these\nconjunctions. In our case the final formula is  \n\\[(\\rA\\wedge \\rB\\wedge\\rC)\\vee (\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\wedge\\neg\\rC)\\vee (\\neg \\rA\\wedge \\rB\\wedge\\neg\\rC).\\]\n\n\nIt is clear that this formula will evaluate as T on\nall the rows that \\(\\star\\)(A, B, C) did and as false on all the other\nrows. Suppose, now, that one is given a propositional formula with any\narbitrary composition of connectives, and that under the classical\ninterpretation these connectives are associated with truth-functional\nconnectives of the appropriate arity. This formula will be equivalent\nto some simple formula with a single connective whose arity is equal\nto the total number of propositional variables in the original\nformula. By the construction just rehearsed, that simple formula is\nagain equivalent to a Boolean formula of a certain form. Thus we have\nverified the Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) theorem:\n\n\nTheorem 1. Any formula of propositional logic\nunder the classical interpretation is equivalent to a disjunction of\nconjunctions of propositional variables and negated propositional\nvariables.\n\n\nSimilar reasoning can be used to verify equivalence to a\n\u201cconjunctive normal formula\u201d, a conjunction of\ndisjunctions of propositional variables and negated propositional\nvariables.\n2.1.2 Truth-functional completeness\n\nOne corollary of the DNF theorem is that Boolean logic\u2014the\nfragment of propositional logic with only the connectives \\(\\neg\\),\n\\(\\wedge\\), and \\(\\vee\\)\u2014is in a sense just as expressive as\nfull classical propositional logic with infinitely many connectives of\ninfinitely many arities. This fact is often expressed by saying that\nthe set of connectives \\(\\{\\neg, \\wedge, \\vee\\}\\) on the classical\ninterpretation is \u201ctruth-functionally complete\u201d: the other\nconnectives aren\u2019t all exactly impostors in the above used\nsense, but they can each be viewed as an abbreviation of some\ncombination of Boolean connectives. Algebraically, one can think of\nthe infinite function space as being fully spanned by the Boolean\nfunctions.\n\nThe idea of truth-functional completeness can be pressed further with\nthe simple observation that \\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\) is the classical\nequivalent of \\(\\neg (\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg\\rB)\\), so that it too can be\nviewed as an abbreviation. So the pair \\(\\{\\vee, \\neg\\}\\) is\ntruth-functionally complete. Likewise, \\(\\rA\\vee\\rB\\) abbreviates\n\\(\\neg (\\neg\\rA\\wedge\\neg\\rB)\\): \\(\\{\\wedge, \\neg\\}\\) is\ntruth-functionally complete. In 1913, Henry Sheffer rediscovered an\nunpublished observation of Charles Sanders Peirce that the functions\n\\(f_9^2\\) and \\(f_{15}^2\\) approximating the truth conditions of the\nnatural language expressions \u201cnot both \u2026and\n\u2026\u201d and \u201cneither \u2026nor \u2026\u201d each\nindividually span the entire space of bivalent truth-functions.\n2.1.3 Realization in switching circuits\n\nMore productive than reducing the number of connectives to the\nsmallest possible truth-functionally complete set, though, has been\nthe selection of connectives that convey the greatest perspicuity into\nthe structure of deductive inference. We have already indicated that\nthe Boolean connectives, by closely approximating the truth conditions\nof the ordinary language particles \u201cnot\u201d,\n\u201cand\u201d, and \u201cor\u201d, provide a formal mechanism\nfor evaluating contentful human inference. Another merit of the\nBoolean selection is its natural realization in the description of\nrelay and switching circuits. In 1940 Claude Shannon described an\ninterpretation of propositional logic in which sentence letters stand\nfor circuits: atomic circuits are nodes \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) connected\nby a gated path which, when closed, allows a current to pass between\n\\(n_1\\) to \\(n_2\\) and, when open, does not. \\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\)\nrepresents the serial connection of circuits A and B, \\(\\rA\\vee\\rB\\)\nrepresents their parallel connection, and \\(\\neg\\rA\\) represents a\ncircuit that is closed if A is open and open if A is closed (this is a\ntheoretical posit: the interpretation alone provides no predetermined\nway to construct such a circuit). Letting the value 0 represent a\ncircuit being closed and the value 1 represent a circuit being open,\none sees that the formulas of propositional logic represent all the\npossible ways of constructing electrical circuits, and their classical\ntruth functional analysis determines exactly whether a circuit so\nrepresented is open: open circuits evaluate as T,\nclosed circuits as F.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of classical propositional logic,\nShannon\u2019s thesis greatly facilitated circuit design.\nImmediately, one sees that any circuit is equivalent to (i.e., opens\nand closes under the same conditions as) a circuit described by a\ndisjunctive normal formula. Thus one could be given complex circuits\nA, B, and C, connect A and B in series (\\(\\rA\\vee\\rB\\)), then connect\nthis in parallel to C (\\((\\rA\\vee\\rB)\\wedge\\rC\\)), and finally desire\na circuit that is closed when this is open: \\(\\neg\n((\\rA\\vee\\rB)\\wedge\\rC)\\). This formula describes the conditions under\nwhich the circuit you are after will be closed, but it does not\nspecify a way of constructing it. The DNF theorem tells us that there\nis a \u201cnormal\u201d circuit with the same closure conditions.\nBecause all switches in such normal circuits apply at the atomic\nlevel, there is a known way to construct them. More, there are\nsystematic methods for simplifying disjunctive normal formulas to\nequivalent formulas with the fewest number of occurrences of atoms\n(Quine 1955 presents an algorithm originally discovered by Samson and\nMills 1954). Combined with Shannon\u2019s result, this shows not only\nthat symbolic manipulation provides a guide for how to construct a\ncircuit with desired closure conditions but that it can be used to\ndesign the least complicated and resource demanding one.\n2.1.4 The material conditional\n\nAnother important feature of the classical interpretation is the\nspecial role played by the binary truth function \\(f_5^2\\), which\nalways returns the value T unless given the input\n\\(\\langle\\)T, F\\(\\rangle\\). This\ntruth function is often described, controversially, as giving the\ntruth conditions for the indicative mood conditional connective\n\u201cif \u2026, then \u2026\u201d, or even, erroneously, for\nthe relation \u201cimplies\u201d. It is important to underscore the\nerror in attributing truth functionality to the implication relation.\nTo say that one proposition implies another is to say that under any\nconditions in which the first is true, the second is also true. To\nsuggest that this relation is truth-functional is to suggest that\nsimply knowing whether A and B are true is enough to determine whether\nA implies B. This suggestion is untenable because the truth or falsity\nof A and B indicate nothing about other conditions. B could be true\nbut, for all that, not be implied by A because under some other\nsituation A could be true while B is false. As emphasized above, the\nimplication relation is not ordinarily thought of as a propositional\nconnective at all, but a relation that two propositions might bear to\none another.\n\nWhat is more interesting is the thesis that \\(f_5^2\\) captures the\ntruth conditions of, at least some uses of, conditional expressions in\nthe indicative mood. The binary connective given this truth-functional\ninterpretation is known as the \u201cmaterial conditional\u201d and\nis often denoted \\(\\supset\\). One can readily check that\n\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) is equivalent to the Boolean expression\n\\(\\neg\\rA\\vee\\rB\\). There is a vast literature about the tenability of\nthe claim that ordinary language conditional expressions are\ntruth-functional. The claim itself is apparently ancient, attributed\nto Philo of Melaga and referenced in Chrysippus\u2019s early\nsystematization of propositional logic. It has been defended in a\nmodern context by Charles Peirce, H. P. Grice, and Frank Jackson. But\nits detractors have been many (see the entry on\n indicative conditionals).\n\nOf special interest is the suggestion, originally due to Frank Ramsey,\nthat expressions of the form \u201cIf A, then B\u201d in the\nindicative mood are best understood in terms of conditional\nprobabilities as \u201cThe probability of B given A is nearly certain\n(\\(\\bP_\\rA (\\rB) > 0.95\\))\u201d. In 1976 David Lewis proved that\nthe conditional expressions, so understood, not only fail to be\ntruth-functional but in fact are not even propositions. Dorothy\nEdgington (1995: 280) provided the following simple argument for\nLewis\u2019s result: Suppose \\(\\bP_\\rA (\\rB)\\) measured the\nprobability of some (not necessarily truth functional) proposition\n\\(\\rA\\cdot\\rB\\). If \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) implies \\(\\rA\\cdot\\rB\\), then\n\\(\\rA\\cdot\\rB\\) is true whenever A is false. Therefore,\n\\(\\rA\\cdot\\rB\\) cannot be unlikely when A is unlikely. But the\nunlikelihood of A certainly does not prevent \\(\\bP_\\rA (\\rB)\\) from\nbeing very low. If, on the other hand, \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) does not\nimply \\(\\rA\\cdot\\rB\\), then \\(\\rA\\cdot\\rB\\) could be false when\n\\(\\neg(\\rA\\wedge\\neg \\rB)\\) is true, and certainty about\n\\(\\neg(\\rA\\wedge\\neg \\rB)\\) would still leave room for doubt about\n\\(\\rA\\cdot\\rB\\). But being certain of \\(\\neg(\\rA\\wedge\\neg\\rB)\\)\nsuffices for \\(\\bP_A (\\rB)=1\\). It follows that \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\)\nneither implies nor doesn\u2019t imply \\(\\rA\\cdot\\rB\\), and the only\nway this could happen is for \\(\\rA\\cdot\\rB\\) not to have\ntruth-conditions at all, for \\(\\bP_\\rA (\\rB)\\) not to measure the\nprobability of any proposition.\n\nThis example highlights again the delicacy of the problem of\ndetermining which connectives can be analyzed under the purview of\npropositional logic. On some interpretations (including the\ntruth-functional one), indicative mood conditionals can be, but on\nRamsey\u2019s interpretation they cannot. In 1982, W. V. O. Quine\nanticipated Lewis\u2019s result by expressing the caution, which he\nattributed to Philip Rhinelander, not to confuse the statement of a\nconditional \u201cIf A, then B\u201d with the statement of B on\ncondition A. The latter, he held, is typically the proper way of\nunderstanding an expression of the form \u201cIf A, then B\u201d,\nwhich, because it is a non-statement in the absence of the condition\nA, cannot be understood as a proposition at all.\n\nGottlob Frege is often counted among the defenders of the material\nconditional, but his attitude towards the connective is nuanced. His\nsystematization of propositional logic did feature a connective with\nthe truth conditions given by \\(f_5^2\\), but Frege rejected the idea\nthat this connective expressed the indicative conditional of natural\nlanguage. He wrote, \u201cthe causal connection implicit in the word\n\u2018if\u2019 \u2026is not expressed by our symbols\u201d (1972:\n116). It is a matter of ongoing debate whether Frege believed that the\nmaterial conditional failed even to capture the truth conditions of\nordinary language indicative conditionals or if he meant only that\nalthough it captures those conditionals\u2019 truth conditions, the\nmaterial conditional fails to capture other, non truth-conditional\naspects of meaning. What is clear is that whatever mismatch he\ndetected between ordinary conditional statements and the material\nconditional did not dissuade him from placing the latter in the center\nof his logical investigations.\n\nGiven the plurality of truth-functionally complete sets of\nconnectives, why would Frege or anyone else select the material\nconditional as a primitive connective for classical logic? Frege saw\nthat the value of selecting the material conditional as a primitive\nconnective not from its approximation of ordinary language expression\nbut from its role internal to logical theory. Let us write\n\\(\\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rB\\) to indicate that the formula B is valid in\nthe classical theory of truth. Generalizing this turnstile notation,\none also writes \\(\\rA \\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rB\\) to indicate that B is a\nclassical propositional consequence of A, and where \\(\\calS\\) is a set\nof propositional formulas, \\(\\calS \\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rB\\) to indicate\nthat B is a classical propositional consequence of all the formulas in\n\\(\\calS\\). A fundamental fact, readily verifiable with a truth table,\nis that \\(\\calS\\cup\\{\\rA\\}\\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rB\\) if, and only if,\n\\(\\calS\\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rA\\supset\\rB\\). In the case that \\(\\calS\\)\nis empty, \\(\\rA\\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rB\\) exactly when\n\\(\\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rA\\supset\\rB\\). Earlier we emphasized that the\nmaterial conditional cannot be understood as an expression of logical\nimplication. The relation of classical logical consequence, on the\nother hand, is in fact a (particularly strict sort of) logical\nimplication relation, one to which the material conditional is in fact\ndirectly related: \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) does not express any implication\nrelation between A and B, but the claim that \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) is a\nclassical propositional validity is such an expression of\nimplication.\n2.1.5 Decidability\n\nA logic is said to be decidable if there is a reliable method for\ndetermining whether a formula is satisfiable. Classical propositional\nlogic is readily seen to be decidable: Given an arbitrary formula,\nsimply enumerate in the tabular method used above each of the possible\nsequences of truth values that can be input to its atomic\npropositional variables, and compute the composition of functions on\neach of these inputs. Because formulas are finite strings of symbols,\neach contains only a finite number, say n, of atoms, so that\nthe truth-table will have exactly \\(2^n\\) rows. Completing the truth\ntable is therefore a finite determinate task, at the end of which one\nwill have discovered whether or not the formula is satisfiable.\n2.1.6 NP-completeness\n\nThe problem of determining whether a formula of classical\npropositional logic is satisfiable is known as sat.\nAlthough decision procedures exists for sat,\nall known procedures for making this\ndetermination in a predetermined manner for every possible formula are\nin a precise sense tedious and inefficient: no procedure has been\ndiscovered which returns an answer after a number of computation steps\npolynomially bounded by the size of the formula one tests, i.e., it is\nunknown whether sat is in the complexity class\nP of problems solvable by a deterministic procedure\nin polynomial time. It is known that sat is in\nthe complexity class NP\u2014those questions that\ncan be answered by a non-deterministic procedure in polynomial time.\nIn 1971, Steven Cook proved that sat is\n\u201cNP-complete\u201d: any problem in the class\nNP is reducible in polynomial time to sat.\nA corollary of Cook\u2019s theorem is that if\nsat is in the class P, then\nNP = P. It is generally believed\nthat NP is a strictly larger class of problems than\nP and, for this reason, that no\n\u201cefficient\u201d procedure for solving sat\nin the sense of polynomial time computability\nexists. In the decades since Cook\u2019s discovery, a wide range of\nproblems have been shown to be NP-complete. But\nclassical propositional logic figured prominently in the context of\nthe discovery of NP-completeness. Its perspicuity was\nparticularly suited to stage the concept\u2019s formation.\n2.1.7 Compactness\n\nA fundamental fact about classical propositional logic is that it is\n\u201ccompact\u201d. To motivate the idea of compactness, consider\nthe set of formulas \\(\\calS = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3, \\neg (p_1\\wedge\np_2\\wedge p_3) \\}\\). Every proper subset of \\(\\calS\\) is\n\u201csimultaneously satisfiable\u201d, i.e., given any such proper\nsubset, there is a single assignment of truth values to atoms under\nwhich each of the subset\u2019s formulas are true. However, \\(\\calS\\)\nitself is not simultaneously satisfiable: Making each of \\(p_1\\),\n\\(p_2\\), and \\(p_3\\) true guarantees the falsity of \\(\\neg (p_1\\wedge\np_2\\wedge p_3)\\). What if another set \\(\\calT\\) contains infinitely\nmany formulas? Our observation about \\(\\calS\\) might well foster the\nintuition that every proper subset of \\(\\calT\\) could be\nsimultaneously satisfiable despite there being no assignment of truth\nvalues to atoms that satisfies every formula in \\(\\calT\\). What if,\ninstead of knowing that every proper subset of \\(\\calT\\) is\nsimultaneously satisfiable, one were told only that each\nfinite subset of \\(\\calT\\) is? Because most proper subsets of\n\\(\\calT\\) are infinite, the intuition that \\(\\calT\\) could\nnevertheless fail to be simultaneously satisfiable is only\nstrengthened.\n\nThe Compactness Theorem (G\u00f6del 1930) tells us that this intuition\nis misleading:\n\n\nTheorem 2. If each finite subset of \\(\\calT\\) is\nsimultaneously satisfiable, then so is \\(\\calT\\).\n\n\nNotice that by \u201crelaxing\u201d the hypothesis from\n\u201cproper subset\u201d to \u201cfinite subset\u201d, the\nCompactness Theorem is true and in fact trivial when \\(\\calT\\) is\nfinite: \\(\\calT\\) is one of its own finite subsets. When \\(\\calT\\) is\ninfinite, though, relaxing the hypothesis dramatically increases the\ntheorem\u2019s strength (In the language of quantification theory,\nthe theorem involves a strong quantifier switch: From the fact that,\ngiven any finite subset of \\(\\calT\\), one can always find an\ninterpretation that satisfies it (potentially a different\ninterpretation for each finite subset), one may infer the existence of\na single interpretation that satisfies every possible finite subset of\n\\(\\calT\\) one might ever be given).\n\nFor a striking corollary of compactness, suppose that A is the\nclassical propositional consequence of the infinite set of formulas\n\\(\\calU\\) (\\(\\calU \\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rA\\)). If every finite subset of\n\\(\\calU\\cup\\{\\neg\\rA\\}\\) were simultaneously satisfiable, then by\ncompactness, \\(\\calU\\cup \\{\\neg\\rA\\}\\) would be simultaneously\nsatisfiable, contrary to the our supposition. Therefore, some finite\nsubset of \\(\\calU\\cup\\{\\neg\\rA\\}\\) is not simultaneously\nsatisfiable\u2014for some finite subset \\(\\calV\\) of \\(\\calU\\), there\nis no assignment of truth values to atoms that makes every formula in\n\\(\\calV\\) true and A false. Classical propositional consequence is\nalways \u201cfinitely determined\u201d: If \\(\\calU \\dturnstile{\\CTT}\n\\rA\\), then for some finite subset \\(\\calV\\) of \\(\\calU\\), \\(\\calV\n\\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rA\\).\n2.2 Deduction\n\nFormal deduction systems, introduced by Gottlob Frege in 1879, provide\nan alternative specification of the meanings of propositional\nconnectives. Such systems are characterized by a finite set of\nformulas called axioms and a finite set of inference rules. The\npropositional axioms in Frege\u2019s system are\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rA&\\supset (\\rB\\supset\\rA) \\tag*{axiom 1}\\\\\n(\\rC\\supset (\\rB\\supset\\rA))&\\supset ((\\rC\\supset\\rB)\\supset (\\rC\\supset\\rA))  \\tag*{axiom 2}\\\\\n(\\rB\\supset\\rA)&\\supset (\\neg\\rA\\supset \\neg\\rB) \\tag*{axiom 3}\\\\\n\\rA&\\supset \\neg\\neg\\rA \\tag*{axiom 4}\\\\\n\\neg\\neg\\rA&\\supset\\rA \\tag*{axiom 5}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n \n\nThe inference rules of are\n\n\n\nmodus ponens: \\(\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\)}\\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\)}\\BinaryInfC{\\(\\rB\\)}\n\\end{prooftree}\\)  \n\n\nsubstitution: If \\(p\\) is an atomic variable in B, and C is any\nformula whatsoever, then let \\(\\rB'\\) be the result of replacing every\noccurrence of \\(p\\) with C, and from B infer \\(\\rB'\\).\n\n\nA proof is defined as a finite sequence of formulas, each one of which\neither is an axiom or follows from previous entries in the sequence by\nan application of an inference rule. A theorem is a formula which\noccurs as the final entry in a proof, and we denote the theoremhood of\na formula A by \\(\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rA\\)\u2014here cpc\nstands for \u201cthe classical propositional\ncalculus\u201d. We have presented the formal deduction system found\nin Frege 1879, but cpc is meant to label any\nequivalent system. Frege\u2019s system is in two senses adequate for\nrepresenting classical propositional logic: Because the pair \\(\\{\\neg,\n\\supset\\}\\) is truth-functionally complete, any formula expressible\nwith any combination of bivalent truth-functional connectives\nwhatsoever can be translated into a formula in Frege\u2019s system.\nMoreover, the system is complete in the sense that all and only the\nclassical propositional tautologies are theorems. The verification of\nthis propositional completeness theorem below uses a different\ndeductive system for cpc due to Hilbert and\nBernays. As Jean Nicod (1917) was the first to observe, there are even\npresentations of cpc using only the single\n\u201cnot both \u2026and \u2026\u201d connective \\(|\\), e.g.,\nwith the lone axiom \n\\[((\\rA | (\\rB | \\rC)) | ((\\rE | (\\rE | \\rE)) | ((\\rD | \\rB) | ((\\rA | \\rD) | (\\rA | \\rD)))))\\]\n\n\nand rules of inference\n\nNicod\u2019s inference: \\(\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\)} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rA|(\\rB|\\rC)\\)} \\BinaryInfC{\\(\\rC\\)}\n\\end{prooftree}\\) \nsubstitution: If \\(p\\) is an atomic variable in B, and C is any\nformula whatsoever, then let B\u2019 be the result of replacing every\noccurrence of \\(p\\) with C, and from B infer B\u2019.\n\n\nIn parallel to the truth-functional framework for classical logic, one\ncan also introduce the notion of deduction from hypotheses: If\n\\(\\calS\\) is a set of formulas, then a sequence of formulas whose last\nentry is A and in which every entry either is an axiom, a member of\n\\(\\calS\\), or the result of an application of a inference rule from\nearlier entries is called a derivation of A from \\(\\calS\\). In\nformulating this notion for cpc, however, some\ncare is needed. One does not want, for example, every formula to be\ndeducible from a propositional variable, and yet the substitution rule\nallows one to infer anything from \\(p_1\\). In moving from pure\naxiomatic provability to the idea of deduction from arbitrary\nhypotheses, therefore, the substitution rule is restricted to be\napplicable only to axioms. One can easily show that this restriction\ndoes not affect the set of theorems. With this restriction in place,\nwe can denote the derivability of A from the set \\(\\calS\\) by \\(\\calS\n\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rA\\).\n2.2.1 The Deduction Theorem\n\nIn 1910 Frege pointed out, but did not prove, that\n\\(\\calS\\cup\\{\\rA\\}\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rB\\) if, and only if,\n\\(\\calS\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rA\\supset\\rB\\). The first recorded proofs are\nin Herbrand 1930 and Tarski 1933. Whereas the analogous observation in\nthe case of the truth-functional interpretation is trivial, this\nresult of Herbrand and Tarski is more complex. One direction is\nreadily verified: Any \\(\\calS\\)-derivation \\(\\calD\\) of\n\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) is obviously also a \\(\\calS\\cup\\{\\rA\\}\\)-derivation.\nTo construct a \\(\\calS\\cup\\{\\rA\\}\\)-derivation of \\(\\rB\\), simply\nappend the two formulas \\(\\rA\\) and \\(\\rB\\) to the end of\n\\(\\calD\\).\n\nThe other direction is known as the Deduction Theorem. It\u2019s\nproof uses induction on the length of the \\(\\calS\\cup\\{\n\\rA\\}\\)-derivation of \\(\\rB\\):\n\n\nTheorem 3. \\(\\calS\\cup\\{\n\\rA\\}\\turnstile{\\CPC}\\rB\\) only if \\(\\calS\n\\turnstile{\\CPC}\\rA\\supset\\rB\\)\n\n\n\nProof. (base step) If there is a\none-line derivation of \\(\\rB\\) from \\(\\calS\\cup\\{ \\rA\\}\\), then it is\npossible to construct a \\(\\calS\\)-derivation of \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\). To\nsee this, notice that there are only three types of one-line\nderivations:\n\n\\(\\rB\\) is in the set \\(\\calS\\)\n\\(\\rB\\) is \\(\\rA\\)\n\\(\\rB\\) is an axiom\n\n\nThe following three \\(\\calS\\)-derivations exhibit the fact that\n\\(\\calS \\turnstile{\\CPC}\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) in case 1, 2, and 3,\nrespectively:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n\n\\rB & (\\rB\\supset\n((\\rC\\supset\\rB)\\supset\\rB))\\supset\n((\\rB\\supset\n(\\rC\\supset\\rB))\\supset(\\rB\\supset\\rB)) &\n\\rB \\\\\n\n\\rB\\supset (\\rA\\supset\\rB) & \\rB\\supset\n((\\rC\\supset\\rB)\\supset\\rB) & \\rB\\supset\n(\\rA\\supset\\rB) \\\\\n\n\\rA\\supset\\rB & (\\rB\\supset\n(\\rC\\supset\\rB))\\supset(\\rB\\supset\\rB)) &\n\\rA\\supset\\rB \\\\\n\n& \\rB\\supset (\\rC\\supset\\rB) & \\\\\n\n& \\rB\\supset\\rB &\n\n  \n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\n\nIt is easy to check that each line of each derivation is either a\nmember of \\(\\calS,\\) an axiom, or the results of an application of\nmodus ponens. (The middle sequence qualifies as a\n\\(\\calS\\)-derivation of \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) because of the assumption\nthat \\(\\rA\\) is \\(\\rB\\).)\n\n(induction step) Assume that whenever there is\na \\(\\calS\\cup\\{ \\rA\\}\\)-derivation of \\(\\rB\\) that is n or\nfewer lines long, there is a \\(\\calS\\)-derivation of\n\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\). Now suppose there is an \\(n+1\\) line long\n\\(\\calS\\cup\\{ \\rA\\}\\)-derivation \\(\\calD\\) of \\(\\rB\\). It is possible\nthat the justification for line \\(n+1\\) is one of the possibilities\nfrom the base case\u2014that \\(\\rB\\) is an axiom, is from the set\n\\(\\Gamma\\), or is identical to \\(\\rA\\). In any of those cases, the\n\\(\\calS\\)-derivation of \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) would be constructed as in\nthe base case. In the novel case that the last line is the result of\nan application of modus ponens, the formulas\n\\(\\rC\\supset\\rB\\) and \\(\\rC\\) occur as earlier lines in \\(\\calD\\).\nTherefore \\(\\calS\\cup\\{ \\rA\\}\\)-derivations that are n lines\nlong or shorter of \\(\\rC\\supset\\rB\\) and \\(\\rC\\) appear as\nsubsequences of \\(\\calD\\). The induction hypothesis then guarantees\nthe existence of \\(\\calS\\)-derivations of \\(\\rA\\supset\n(\\rC\\supset\\rB)\\) and of \\(\\rA\\supset\\rC\\). Let  \n\\[\\calD_1 = \\langle\\rS_1, \\rS_2, \\ldots, \\rA\\supset (\\rC\\supset\\rB)\\rangle\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\calD_2 = \\langle\\rT_1, \\rT_2, \\ldots, \\rA\\supset\\rC\\rangle\\]\n\n\nbe examples of such derivations, and consider the sequence:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{c}\n\n  \\calD_1\\\\\n  \\calD_2\\\\\n  (\\rA\\supset (\\rC\\supset\\rB))\\supset\n  ((\\rA\\supset\\rC)\\supset\n  (\\rA\\supset\\rB))\\\\\n  (\\rA\\supset\\rC)\\supset\n  (\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\\\\n  \\rA\\supset\\rB\n\n\\end{array}\\]\n \n\nThis is a \\(\\calS\\)-derivation of \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\).\u00a0\u25fb\n\n\nBecause this verification of the Deduction Theorem depends only on the\nfirst two of Frege\u2019s axioms, it applies also in many\nnon-classical contexts including, importantly, a large class of\nconstructive propositional logics.\n2.2.2 Basic meta-theory\n\nAnother analogue to the evident facts from the truth-functional\nframework, this time the DNF theorem, played a historical role in the\nmetatheoretical analysis of axiomatic systems. Hilbert showed how to\nassociate with every formula A a disjunctive normal formula\n\\(\\rA_{\\dnf}\\) and a conjunctive normal formula \\(\\rA_{\\cnf}\\) such\nthat  \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n&\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rA \\supset\\rA_{\\dnf},\\\\ \n&\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rA_{\\dnf} \\supset\\rA, \\\\\n&\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rA \\supset\\rA_{\\cnf}, \\text{ and }\\\\ \n&\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rA_{\\cnf} \\supset\\rA.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nIn particular, applying the Deduction Theorem, A and \\(\\rA_{\\cnf}\\)\nare inter-derivable.\n\nFrege\u2019s axiomatization obviously depends on the expressive\nadequacy of the pair \\(\\{\\supset, \\neg\\}\\), about which one cannot\nreally be certain unless one has in mind some account of the meaning\nof the connectives other than that provided by the deduction system\nitself. Russell and Whitehead in Principia Mathematica and\nHilbert and Ackermann in 1928 followed Frege in working with a small\nset of basic connectives and using others as abbreviations. In 1926,\nBernays questioned \u201cthe predominant tendency \u2026to reduce\nthe number of basic connectives and therewith the number of\naxioms\u201d, observing that \u201cone can, on the other hand,\nsharply distinguish the various connectives\u201d and thereby not\npresuppose equivalences such as \\(\\neg\\rA\\vee\\rB = \\rA\\supset\\rB\\)\nthat do not appear in the axiomatic framework itself. Such an approach\nallows one to explore modifications of an axiom system in which\ncertain equivalences do not hold, and to compare them with one\nanother. The axiomatic framework is generally a crude device for such\ncomparative studies; the spirit of Bernays\u2019s insight reached its\nmaturation in the natural deduction and sequent calculi of Gentzen\n(1934\u201335) wherein the meaning of each connective is fully\nspecified, in terms of characterizing inference rules, in isolation of\nthe other connectives.\n\nThe axiomatic framework with minimal signature (following Russell and\nWhitehead, Hilbert used only \\(\\{\\vee, \\neg\\}\\)) nevertheless\nsubmitted to the Hilbert school\u2019s profound metatheoretical\nanalysis in terms of consistency, independence, maximality, and\ncompleteness proofs. In order to preserve the context of discovery,\nthe following retraces the original proofs provided in Hilbert\u2019s\nlectures \u201cPrinzipien der Mathematik\u201d from 1917.\n2.2.2.1 Consistency\n\nAn formal deductive system S is\nconsistent if for no formula A is \\(\\turnstile{\\rS} \\rA\\) and\n\\(\\turnstile{\\rS} \\neg\\rA\\). To prove consistency of cpc,\nHilbert reasoned as follows: Let the sentence\nletters range over the numbers 1 and 0, interpret the disjunction\nsymbol as multiplication and the negation symbol as the function \\(1 -\nx\\). In this interpretation, every formula is a function on 0 and 1\ncomposed of multiplication and \\(1 - x\\). Hilbert observed that the\naxioms are each interpreted as functions that return the value 0 on\nevery input, and that the rules of inference each preserve this\nproperty (so that every theorem is constant 0). Furthermore, the\nnegation of any theorem is constant 1 and therefore unprovable. Thus,\nno formula is provable if its negation also is, so the system is\nconsistent.\n2.2.2.2 Maximality\n\nA formal deductive system is maximal if any proper extension\nof it is inconsistent. Hilbert used the same interpretation from his\nconsistency argument to show:\n\n\nTheorem 4. cpc is\nmaximal.\n\n\n\nProof. As above, a formula is provable only if it is constant\n0 under the interpretation, which, in the case of a conjunctive normal\nformula, occurs precisely when each of its conjuncts contains both a\nnegated and unnegated occurrence of some propositional variable. Now\nlet A be any unprovable formula. Its associated formula \\(\\rA_{\\cnf}\\)\nmust also be unprovable and therefore must contain a conjunct C with\nno propositional variable appearing both negated and unnegated. To\nshow that cpc+A (cpc\naugmented with A as an additional axiom) is inconsistent, let B be any\nformula whatsoever, and label D the result of substituting, into\n\\(\\rA_{\\cnf}\\), B for every propositional variable that occurs\nunnegated in C and \\(\\neg\\rB\\) for every propositional variable that\noccurs negated in C. It is easy to show that  \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n&\\turnstile{\\CPC+\\rA} \\rA, \\\\\n&\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rA\\supset\\rA_{\\cnf},\\\\\n&\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rA_{\\cnf}\\supset\\rD, \\text{ and}\\\\\n&\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rD\\supset\\rB.\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nThus \\(\\turnstile{\\CPC+\\rA} \\rB\\) for any formula B.\u00a0\u25fb\n\n\nHilbert and others called this same property\n\u201ccompleteness\u201d, in analogy to the completeness axiom from\nHilbert\u2019s foundational studies of plane geometry and number\ntheory. But as completeness has come to mean something else in the\nlogical domain, this property is now commonly referred to as\n\u201cPost-completeness\u201d (after Post 1921 who rediscovered this\nproperty of cpc) or, as here, as\n\u201cmaximality\u201d.\n2.2.2.3 Completeness\n\nThe Completeness Theorem describes an exact correspondence between the\ntruth-functional and deductive frameworks:\n\n\nTheorem 5. \\(\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rA\\) if, and only\nif, \\(\\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rA\\).\n\n\n\nProof. This result is often described as difficult to\nestablish, but in Hilbert\u2019s 1917 lectures, it is an immediate\ncorollary of maximality. Already it was observed in the consistency\nargument that only formulas interpreted as constant 0 functions are\nprovable. Suppose that some formula A were constant 0 but unprovable\nin cpc. Then the same consistency argument as\nbefore would carry through for cpc+A,\ncontradicting the maximality result just proved. It follows that every\nformula interpreted as a constant 0 function is a theorem of cpc.\nThe formulas interpreted as constant 0\nfunctions are just the valid formulas on the classical\ntruth-functional interpretation.\u00a0\u25fb\n\n\nA direct route to the Completeness Theorem is also possible. A famous\nproof from Kalm\u00e1r 1935 begins with two observations:\n\nK1\n \\(\\turnstile{\\CPC} (\\rA\\supset \\rB)\\supset ((\\neg \\rA\\supset\n\\rB)\\supset \\rB)\\)\nK2\nLet A be any formula with propositional variables \\(p_1\\),\n\\(p_2\\), \u2026, \\(p_n\\), and let \\(\\mathit{v}\\) be an assignment of\ntruth values to propositional variables. Define \\(\\rC_k = p_1\\) if\n\\(\\mathit{v}(p_1) = \\mathbf{T}\\), \\(\\neg p_1\\) if \\(\\mathit{v}(p_k) =\n\\mathbf{F}\\). Then if \\(\\mathit{v}(\\rB) = \\mathbf{T}\\), \\(\\rC_1,\n\\rC_2, \\ldots, \\rC_n \\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rB\\).\n\n\n\nProof. Suppose now that T is a classical validity with\npropositional variables \\(p_1\\), \\(p_2\\), \u2026, \\(p_n\\). Then by\n K2,\n for every assignment \\(\\mathit{v}\\) of truth values to propositional\nvariables, \\(\\mathit{v}(\\rT) = \\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\rC_1, \\rC_2,\n\\ldots, \\rC_n \\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rT\\). Let \\(\\mathit{u}\\) and\n\\(\\mathit{w}\\) be assignments of truth values that differ only in that\n\\(\\mathit{u}(p_n) = \\mathbf{T}\\) whereas \\(\\mathit{w}(p_n) =\n\\mathbf{F}.\\)  \n\\[\\rC_1, \\rC_2, \\ldots, \\rC_{n-1}, p_n \\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rT\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\rC_1, \\rC_2, \\ldots, \\rC_{n-1}, \\neg p_n \\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rT.\\]\n\n\nBy the Deduction Theorem, \n\\[\\rC_1, \\rC_2, \\ldots, \\rC_{n-1} \\turnstile{\\CPC} p_n\\supset \\rT,\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\rC_1, \\rC_2, \\ldots, \\rC_{n-1} \\turnstile{\\CPC} \\neg p_n\\supset \\rT.\\]\n\n\nBy\n K1,\n  \n\\[\\rC_1, \\rC_2, \\ldots, \\rC_{n-1} \\turnstile{\\CPC} (p_n\\supset \\rT)\\supset ((\\neg p_n\\supset \\rT)\\supset \\rT).\\]\n\n\nTwo applications of modus ponens yield \n\\[\\rC_1, \\rC_2, \\ldots, \\rC_{n-1} \\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rT.\\]\n\n\nRepeating this same reasoning for \\(p_{n-1}\\) yields  \n\\[\\rC_1, \\rC_2, \\ldots, \\rC_{n-2} \\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rT,\\]\n\n\nand after n repetitions \\(\\turnstile{\\CPC} \\rT\\) is\nestablished.\u00a0\u25fb\n\n\nProving completeness directly in this manner allows a different\nargument for maximality:\n\n\nProof. For suppose \\(\\centernot{\\turnstile{\\CPC}} \\rA\\). Then\nby completeness, \\(\\centernot{\\dturnstile{\\CTT}} \\rA\\). So there is\nsome assignment \\(\\mathit{v}\\) of truth values to propositional\nvariables on which A evaluates as F. Let \\(\\rA'\\) be\nthe result of replacing every propositional variable assigned\nT by \\(\\mathit{v}\\) with \\(p_1\\supset p_1\\) and every\npropositional variable assigned F by \\(\\mathit{v}\\)\nwith \\(p_1\\supset\\neg p_1\\). \\(\\rA'\\) is unsatisfiable. Therefore\n\\(\\neg \\rA'\\) is valid. So \\(\\turnstile{\\CPC+\\rA} \\neg\\rA'\\). But\n\\(\\turnstile{\\CPC+\\rA} \\rA\\) and, by substitution,\n\\(\\turnstile{\\CPC+\\rA} \\rA'\\). So cpc+A is\ninconsistent.\u00a0\u25fb\n\n2.2.2.4 Completeness as semi-decidability\n\nThe set of theorems of a formal deductive system can be seen to be\nrecursively enumerable. To construct a simple enumeration, let us add\nto the language of propositional logic the symbol \u201c;\u201d as a\nsequential location demarcator so that the language consists of \\(p_1,\np_2, \\ldots, (, ), \\supset, \\neg, \\hbox{and} ;\\). Then we can list all\npossible sequences of symbols in stages:\n\n\nStage 1: list all strings of symbols of length 1 using only the\npropositional variable \\(p_1\\).\nStage 2: list all strings of symbols of length 1 or 2 using only\npropositional variables \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\).\n...\n\n\n\nAt each stage, the vocabulary is finite, so there are only finitely\nmany strings of symbols to list. But every proof is a finite string of\nsymbols and therefore gets listed at some stage or another. Therefore,\ngiven a formula A, one can begin searching for a proof one stage at a\ntime, checking only finitely many strings at each stage. If A is\nvalid, then by completeness it is provable, and one will discover a\nproof of it after examining some finite number of strings. On the\nother hand, if A is not valid, the search will never halt.\n\nCompleteness results are often described as valuable because they make\nevident the recursive enumerability of a logic\u2019s validities. In\nthe case of classical propositional logic, validity is already known\nto be recursively enumerable and even decidable by a much simpler and\nmore efficient method of truth table evaluation. The Completeness\nTheorem\u2019s value derives instead from the fact that two vastly\ndifferent conceptions of logicality\u2014formal provability and\ntruth-functional validity\u2014coincide. The situation is different\nwith other logical systems. The most famous example is first-order\nclassical quantification theory, which Church and Turing proved to be\nundecidable in 1936. Here, the Completeness Theorem of G\u00f6del 1930\nis especially insightful: the set of quantificational validities is\nnot recursive, but it is at least recursively enumerable. In fact, the\ncompleteness results for classical propositional logic and\nquantification theory were the historical occasion for the\nclarification of the distinction between recursive and recursively\nenumerable sets\u2014a distinction seen as elementary today but the\nsource of considerable confusion in the first decades of the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nCompleteness results can play a role for many alternative systems of\npropositional logic similar to the one they play for classical\nquantification theory: Urquhart 1984 showed that the systems e\nand r of relevance logic\nare undecidable; Lincoln et al. 1992 showed that full propositional\nlinear logic ll is undecidable. In these\narenas, a complete formal derivation system can provide some concrete\naccess to the space of valid formulas whose abstract definition is not\notherwise readily navigable.\n2.2.2.5 Independence\n\nThe style of reasoning exhibited in the consistency argument can be\ngeneralized to show independence results. The idea of the consistency\nargument was first to describe a property P such that\n\n\n\nall the axioms have P, and\n\n\nif an inference rule is applied to a formula with P, then the formula\nthat results from its application also has P\n\n\nand then to show that certain formulas do not have P. Because all\ntheorems either are axioms or are generated from axioms by iterated\napplications of inference rules, those latter formulas cannot be\ntheorems.\n\nIn the consistency proof, P is the property of being interpreted as a\nconstant 0 function, and the formulas that do not have P are the\nnegations of theorems. The reasoning can be generalized, though.\nSuppose P were some other property that all but one of the axioms have\nand that is similarly preserved by the inference rules. By verifying\nthis one could show that the one axiom is not derivable from the\nothers and therefore that the deductive system would have fewer\ntheorems without it. For example, the classical interpretation of\n\\(\\supset\\) is a function that returns 1 on the input \\(\\langle 0,\n1\\rangle\\) and 0 otherwise, and the classical interpretation of\n\\(\\neg\\) is the function that returns 1 on the input 0 and returns 0\non the input 1. All five of Frege\u2019s axioms are constant 0 on\nthis interpretation. If we modify the interpretation so that\n\\(\\supset\\) is unchanged but \\(\\neg\\) returns 1 on the input 1 and\nreturns 0 on the input 0, then\n axioms 1, 2, 4, and 5\n are still interpreted as constant 0 functions, whereas axiom 3\nreturns 1 on the input \\(\\langle 0, 1\\rangle\\). The inference rules\nstill preserve the property of being constant 0 on this modified\ninterpretation, so we know that axiom 3 cannot be proved using only\naxioms 1, 2, 4, and 5 and that without axiom 3 Frege\u2019s system\nwould not be complete.\n\nFor a more interesting example, consider the interpretation of\n\\(\\supset\\) and \\(\\neg\\) in terms of trivalent functions given by the\nfollowing tables:\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nA\nB\n\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\)  \n\n\n0\n0\n0 \n\n1\n0\n0 \n\n2\n0\n0 \n\n0\n1\n1 \n\n1\n1\n0 \n\n2\n1\n0 \n\n0\n2\n2 \n\n1\n2\n2 \n\n2\n2\n0  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nA\n\\(\\neg\\rA\\)  \n\n\n0\n2 \n\n1\n2 \n\n2\n0  \n\n\n\n\nIf P is the property of being a constant 0 function on this\ninterpretation, then one can verify that\n\n\n\naxioms 1, 2, 3, and 4 each have P\n\n\nP is preserved by modus ponens and substitution\n\n\naxiom 5 evaluates as 1 on the input 1 and so does not have property\nP\n\n\nand that axiom 5 is therefore independent of the first four\naxioms.\n\nThe use of non-classical (typically higher valence) truth-functional\ninterpretations to define properties to be used in independence proofs\ndates back to Schr\u00f6der 1890. It was pursued in full generality by\n\u0141ukasiewicz, who also proved results about the scope of this\ntechnique.\n2.3 Gentzen\u2019s calculi\n\nIn 1934\u201335, Gerhard Gentzen introduced two alternative\nframeworks for presenting deductive inference that have led to\nparticularly refined analyses of propositional logic. We will look\nfirst at Gentzen\u2019s system of natural deduction and later\nconsider his sequent calculus.\n2.3.1 Natural deduction\n\nIn lectures from early 1920, David Hilbert remarked that a formal\ndeduction system\u2019s inference rules can be thought of as\nproviding the meanings of the connectives they govern (Hilbert 2013:\n323). Hilbert\u2019s idea is given a profound realization in\nGentzen\u2019s natural deduction calculus. Natural deduction is an\nearly and emblematic achievement in \u201cproof-theoretic\nsemantics\u201d: the tradition of specifying definitions in\ninferential, rather than denotational, terms.\n\nIn systems like cpc the only inference rule\nresponsible specifically to a connective is modus ponens.\nWhat would it mean for this rule not only to describe a deductively\nvalid pattern of inference but in fact to provide a definition of the\nconnective \\(\\supset\\)? If one understands modus ponens not\njust as one among many patterns of valid inference but as saying that\nit is definitive of the conditional \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) that it\nlicenses the inference from \\(\\rA\\) to \\(\\rB\\), then part of what one\nmeans is that any sentence that, together with \\(\\rA\\), allows the\ninference to \\(\\rB\\) expresses something equivalent to or stronger\nthan \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\). To illustrate this, let us rewrite modus\nponens in the turnstile notation as  \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\rA\\supset\\rB, \\rA\n\\vdash \\rB\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nUnderstood as a definition of \\(\\supset\\), this determines the\nfollowing form of the Deduction Theorem, stating that\n\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) can be inferred from any other formula that\nsimilarly licenses the inference from A to B:  \n\\[\n\\hbox{for all }\\rC, \\hbox{if } \\rC, \\rA\n\\vdash \\rB, \\hbox{then }\n\\rC\\vdash \\rA\\supset\\rB\n\\]\n\n\nIn Gentzen\u2019s terminology, rules like modus ponens that\ndescribe the definitive way of reasoning from a sentence governed by a\ncertain connective are called \u201celimination rules\u201d. The\nDeduction Theorem, in describing the definitive pattern of reasoning\nwhose conclusion is governed by a certain connective, is an example of\nan \u201cintroduction rule\u201d. Gentzen wrote: \n\n\nThe introductions represent \u2026the \u201cdefinitions\u201d of\nthe symbols concerned, and the eliminations are no more, in the final\nanalysis, than the consequences of these definitions. \u2026By\nmaking these ideas more precise it should be possible to display the\nElim-rules as unique functions of their corresponding Intro-rules.\n(1934\u201335: \u00a7II 5.13) \n\n\nThe precisification Gentzen foresaw is this: Elimination rules are not\n\u201cconsequences\u201d of their corresponding introduction rules;\nneither are introduction rules \u201cconsequences\u201d of their\ncorresponding elimination rules; but rules of the one type do follow\nfrom the conception of their corresponding rules of the other type as\ndefinitions. When conditionalization is understood as an operation\nthat maps \\(\\rA\\) and \\(\\rB\\) to the proposition that together with\n\\(\\rA\\) licenses an inference to \\(\\rB\\), modus ponens\ncaptures the part about licensing this inference, and the Deduction\nTheorem captures the part about being the thing that so\nlicenses it, so that any other proposition that allows an inference\nfrom \\(\\rA\\) to \\(\\rB\\) only does so via \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\)\n(see Franks 2021).\n\nTo take another example, consider the inferences \\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\vdash\n\\rA\\) and \\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\vdash \\rB\\). One might think of these as\ndefinitive of the logical conjunction: To know \\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\) is to\nbe in a position to immediately infer both A and B. If so, then simply\nbeing in the position to immediately infer both A and B should suffice\nto allow one to conclude \\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\): For all \\(\\rC\\), if\n\\(\\rC\\vdash \\rA\\) and \\(\\rC\\vdash \\rB\\), then \\(\\rC\\vdash\n\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\). Here again, Gentzen labeled the first pair of\ninferences the elimination rule for \\(\\wedge\\) and the latter\ninference its introduction rule.\n\nGentzen\u2019s system of natural deduction is a presentation of logic\nin terms of an intro/elim pair of rules, related as are modus\nponens and the Deduction theorem, providing an inferential\ndefinition of each logical particle. His natural deduction system of\npropositional logic has such pairs of rules for the propositional\nconnectives \\(\\supset\\), \\(\\wedge\\), \\(\\vee\\), and \\(\\neg\\), which he\npresented in two-dimensional inference figures: \n\\[\\hspace{-10em}\n\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\)} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\)}\n\\RightLabel{\\({\\supset}\\text{elim}\\)} \\BinaryInfC{\\(\\rB\\)}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{4em}\n\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\([\\rA]\\)} \\noLine\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\vdots\\)}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\rB\\)} \\RightLabel{\\({\\supset}\\text{intro}\\)}\n\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\)} \\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\\[\\hspace{-4em}\n\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\)} \\UnaryInfC{\\(\\rA\\)}\n\\end{prooftree} \\quad \\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\)}\n\\RightLabel{\\({\\wedge}\\text{elim}\\)} \\UnaryInfC{\\(\\rB\\)}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{4em}\n\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\)} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rB\\)}\n\\RightLabel{\\({\\wedge}\\text{intro}\\)} \\BinaryInfC{\\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\)}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n \n\\[\\hspace{-3em}\n\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\vee\\rB\\)} \\AxiomC{[\\(\\rA\\)]}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\vdots\\)} \\noLine\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\rC\\)}\n\\AxiomC{[\\(\\rB\\)]} \\noLine\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\vdots\\)}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\rC\\)} \\RightLabel{\\({\\vee}\\text{elim}\\)}\n\\TrinaryInfC{\\(\\rC\\)} \\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{7em}\n\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\)} \\UnaryInfC{\\(\\rA\\vee\\rB\\)}\n\\end{prooftree} \\quad \\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rB\\)}\n\\RightLabel{\\({\\vee}\\text{intro}\\)} \\UnaryInfC{\\(\\rA\\vee\\rB\\)}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n \n\\[\\hspace{-10em}\n\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\(\\neg\\rA\\)} \\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\)}\n\\RightLabel{\\({\\neg}\\text{elim}\\)} \\BinaryInfC{\\(\\bot\\)}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{6em}\n\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\([\\rA]\\)} \\noLine\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\vdots\\)}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\bot\\)} \\RightLabel{\\({\\neg}\\text{intro}\\)}\n\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\neg A\\)} \\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nNotice the appearance of the arity-0 connective \\(\\bot\\) in the\n\\(\\neg\\) rules, which has no inferential definition of its own.\n\nNatural deduction proofs are trees constructed by iterating these\nrules. When all the assumptions in such a proof are discharged by the\napplication of a rule, the formula in the tree\u2019s single root\nnode is said to be proved; otherwise it is said to be derived from the\nset of assumptions that remain open at leaf nodes. Let us write\n\\(\\turnstile{\\ND} \\rA\\) when there is a natural deduction proof of\nA.\n\nGentzen observed that the natural deduction calculus with intro/elim\npairs of rules for the connectives \\(\\supset\\), \\(\\wedge\\), \\(\\vee\\),\nand \\(\\neg\\) is not equivalent to classical propositional\nlogic: \\(\\turnstile{\\ND} \\rA\\) only if \\(\\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rA\\), but,\nfor example, \\(\\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rA\\vee\\neg\\rA\\) whereas\n\\(\\centernot{\\turnstile{\\ND}} \\rA\\vee\\neg\\rA\\). \u201cThe law of\nexcluded middle, which the intuitionists reject\u201d, Gentzen wrote,\n\u201coccupies a special position\u201d in natural deduction.\nGentzen\u2019s framework revealed that the specification of the\nmeanings of the propositional connectives in terms of binary truth\nfunctions does not correspond with the \u201cinferential\u201d\nspecification of their meanings in terms of the intro/elim rule\nscheme. In fact, Johansson pointed out in 1937 that the introduction\nand elimination rules of Gentzen\u2019s natural deduction cannot even\nderive the rule of disjunctive syllogism  \n\\[\n  \\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{\\(\\rA\\vee\\rB\\)}\\AxiomC{\\(\\neg\\rB\\)}\\BinaryInfC{\\(\\rA\\)}\n  \\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nThis elementary inference that Chrysippus famously attributed to\nhunting dogs cannot be justified by the inferential meaning of the\n\\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\vee\\) connectives alone. To derive the disjunctive\nsyllogism rule, one needs the additional primitive inference figure\n \n\\[\n  \\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{\\(\\bot\\)}\\UnaryInfC{A}\n  \\end{prooftree}\n\\qquad(\\textit{ex falso quodlibet});\\]\n\n\nto derive the principle of excluded middle, one needs in addition the\ndouble negation rule  \n\\[\n  \\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{\\(\\neg\\neg\\rA\\)}\\UnaryInfC{\\(\\rA\\)} \n  \\end{prooftree}.\n\\]\n\n\nThese rules can be used together with the introduction and elimination\nrules for the propositional connectives to construct natural deduction\nsystems nd+\\(\\frac{\\bot}{\\rA}\\) for\nintuitionistic propositional logic and nd+\\(\\frac{\\neg\\neg\\rA}{\\rA}\\)\nfor classical\npropositional logic, but Gentzen observed, such inference schemata\n\u201cfall outside the intro/elim framework \u2026\u201d.\n(Classical propositional logic is often given a natural deduction\npresentation nd+\\(\\frac{\\bot}{\\rA}\\)+\\(\\frac{\\neg\\neg\\rA}{\\rA}\\),\nbut the ex falso quodlibet rule is redundant in that system\nbecause \\(\\bot \\turnstile{\\ND+({\\neg\\neg\\rA}/{\\rA})} \\rB\\).)\n\nThe distinction between classical and intuitionistic logic predates\nGentzen\u2019s work. But with its inferential definition of\npropositional connectives, natural deduction sheds new light on the\ndistinction: classical, intuitionist, and other logicians can agree to\nthe same definitions of the propositional connectives, the differences\nbetween their conceptions of logic having to do with the acceptability\nof principles like the law of excluded middle that are independent of\nthe connectives\u2019 meanings.\n2.3.2 Sequent calculus\n\nThis same point is brought out in a different way in Gentzen\u2019s\npropositional sequent calculi. These calculi present logical inference\nin the form of sequents: expressions of the form \u201c\\(\\Gamma\n\\Lrightarrow \\Delta\\)\u201d in which Greek letters stand for\n(possibly empty) finite sequences of formula. The sequences to the\nleft and to the right of the coordinating \u201csequent arrow\u201d\n\\(\\Lrightarrow\\) are called the antecedent and succedent.

(Obviously the rules exchange(R) and contraction(R) play\nno role in pi and can be omitted.) \n\n\nCut Elimination Theorem: If one modifies pk\nand pi simply by removing the rule\n\u201ccut\u201d, the resulting calculi  pk-\nand pi- are such that \\(\\turnstile{\\PK} \\rA\\)\nif, and only if, \\(\\turnstile{\\text{PK-}} \\rA\\), and\n\\(\\turnstile{\\text{PI}} \\rA\\) if, and only if,\n\\(\\turnstile{\\text{PI-}} \\rA\\). \n\n\nAll the formulas that appear anywhere in a pk-\nor pi- proof are subformulas of the formulas\nthat appear in the endsequent. (This \u201csubformula property\u201d\nclearly does not hold of pk and pi\nproofs.) \n\n\nObservation 2 provides yet another perspective on the way logicians\ncould disagree about the validity of principles like the law of\nexcluded middle without disagreeing about the meanings of the\npropositional connectives. The treatment of \\(\\vee\\) and \\(\\neg\\) is\nidentical in pk and pi;\nthe only difference between them is in the\nbackground structure of reasoning.\n\nObservation 1 allows one immediately to conclude that pk\nis complete with respect to the classical truth\nfunctional interpretation of propositional logic. Gentzen did not draw\nthis conclusion because he had a different understanding of\ncompleteness made possible by the sequent calculus: Because the rule\n\u201ccut\u201d can be shown to fully capture the general concept of\nlogical consequence\u2014something Gentzen took himself to have\ndemonstrated in 1932\u2014, observation 3, that \u201ccut\u201d is\neliminable from pk, shows that the left/right\nrules for the propositional connectives are complete in the sense that\nno logical consequence of formulas provable with them is itself\nunprovable with them (see Franks 2010). This way of framing\ncompleteness has the further advantage that pi\ncan be said to be complete in the same sense.\n2.3.3 Constructive completeness of pk and of pi\n\nBecause of observation 4, however, it is possible to prove the\ncompleteness of pk in the usual sense very\nsimply.\n\n\nProof. Let us call a sequent \\(\\Gamma\\Lrightarrow \\Delta\\)\nvalid if the formula \\(\\bigwedge\\Gamma\\supset\\bigvee\\Delta\\) is valid\non the classical truth-functional interpretation. As one expects, it\nis easy to check that all the rules of pk\npreserve validity. More surprisingly, the same rules, except for\nthinning, preserve validity when read backwards. Call such inference\nfigures \u201cinvertible\u201d. Suppose now that one is given a\nsequent \\(\\Gamma\\Lrightarrow \\Delta\\) containing n logical\nconnectives. A straightforward mathematical induction demonstrates\nthat, if \\(\\Gamma\\Lrightarrow \\Delta\\) is valid, then there is a pk-proof\nof it. Suppose first that \\(n=0\n(\\Gamma\\Lrightarrow \\Delta\\) contains no logical connectives). Then\nthere must be some atom \\(p_i\\) that appears in both its antecedent\nand its succedent. Obviously \\(\\Gamma\\Lrightarrow \\Delta\\) can be\nproved from \\(p_i \\rightarrow p_i\\) by a series of thinning and\nexchange inferences. Now with the induction hypothesis that\n\\(\\Gamma\\Lrightarrow \\Delta\\) is provable when \\(n=k\\), suppose\n\\(n=k+1\\). Select any formula in \\(\\Gamma\\Lrightarrow \\Delta\\) that is\nnot atomic and identify its main connective. Suppose, for example,\nthat it is in \\(\\Gamma\\) and its main connective is \\(\\supset\\). Then\nwe can begin building a proof from the bottom up, using\n\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) as our selected formula and \\(\\Theta\\) to stand for\n\\(\\Gamma\\) with the selected occurrence of the formula\n\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) deleted: \n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n \\AxiomC{\\(\\Theta \\Lrightarrow \\Delta, \\rA\\)}\n \\AxiomC{\\(\\rB, \\Theta \\Lrightarrow \\Delta\\)}\n \\RightLabel{ $\\supset$(L)}\n \\BinaryInfC{\\(\\dfrac{\\rA \\supset \\rB, \\Theta\\Lrightarrow \\Delta}\n                     {\\phantom{\\rA \\supset \\rB,\\,}\\Gamma\\Lrightarrow \\Delta}\\)}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\kern-5em\\lower 1.5em \\text{exchange(L)}\\]\n\n\nBecause of the invertibility of \\(\\supset\\)(L) both leaf\nnodes of this tree are labeled with valid sequents containing k\nconnectives. The induction hypothesis guarantees that they have pk-proofs.\nTherefore \\(\\Gamma\\Lrightarrow \\Delta\\)\nhas a pk-proof. An analogous argument applies\nfor each connective. In the special case that \\(\\Gamma\\) is empty and\n\\(\\Delta\\) contains a single (valid) formula, this construction shows\nthat \\(\\turnstile{\\text{PK-}} \\rA\\) if \\(\\dturnstile{\\CTT}\n\\rA.\\) \u25fb\n\n\nAs was mentioned, Gentzen did not present this very simple version of\nthe completeness theorem. Because he was interested in cut-elimination\nas an expression of the completeness of his rules, he pursued that\ninstead, providing an elaborate proof transformation technique.\nKnowledge of the completeness of pk-, though,\nleads to an alternate verification of cut-elimination: Suppose\n\\(\\turnstile{\\PK} \\rA\\). Because all basic sequents are valid and all\npk rules preserve validity,\n\\(\\dturnstile{\\CTT} \\rA\\). But pk- is\ncomplete, so \\(\\turnstile{\\PK\\text{-}} \\rA\\) .\n\nReflection on the construction implicit in this completeness argument\nin fact shows that an arbitrary formula can in this way be tested for\nvalidity and therefore provides a new decision procedure for classical\nlogic: The end result of the construction will either be a proof or\nwill be a tree whose leaf nodes indicate how to construct a falsifying\ninterpretation for \\(\\Gamma\\Lrightarrow \\Delta.\\)\n\nA version of the same argument applies also to pi,\nnot\u2014of course\u2014to show that it is\ncomplete with respect to its classical truth-functional\ninterpretation, but to show that it is complete with respect to\nanother sort of interpretation based on Kripke frames. The interesting\nthing about this approach to an analysis of intuitionistic logic is\nthat one need not have in mind in advance what sort of interpretation\none wants to show pi complete with respect to.\nJust setting out algorithmically to build a cut-free pi\nproof will either succeed or will indicate the\nsort of falsifying interpretation that applies in the intuitionistic\ncase (see Takeuti 1987 [2013]).\n3. Non-Classical Interpretations\n\nClassical propositional logic is evidently a valuable framework not\nonly for organizing principles of reasoning but for providing a fairly\nsimple setting for showcasing basic theoretical phenomena such as\ncompleteness, formal consistency, axiomatic independence, and the\nlike. But a considerable measure of the value of its systematic\ndevelopment lies in the indications, along the way, of ways to deviate\nfrom the classical framework and devise alternative interpretations of\nthe propositional connectives. We have touched on a few indications\nalready: the independence of the principle of excluded middle from the\nother axioms in Frege\u2019s formal deduction system, the\nimplausibility of the material conditional as an analysis of the truth\nconditions of ordinary indicative mood \u201cif \u2026then\u201d\nstatements, etc. Here we survey some of the most prevalent alternative\nsystems of propositional logic.\n3.1 Multi-valued logics\n\nAlready we indicated how truth-functional interpretations with valence\ngreater than 2 can be utilized to provide independence proofs for\naxiom systems. G\u00f6del (1932) defined a sequence\n\\(\\{S_n\\}_{n=2}^\\infty\\) of n-valued logics that generalize the\nclassical interpretation: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n    v(\\neg\\rA)  &=  \\begin{cases}\n               0                 & v(\\rA) = n-1\\\\\n               n-1               & \\text{otherwise}\n                  \\end{cases}\\\\\n    v(\\rA\\wedge\\rB)  &=  \\mathbf{max}\\{v(\\rA),\nv(\\rB)\\}\\\\\n    v(\\rA\\vee\\rB)  &=  \\mathbf{min}\\{v(\\rA),\nv(\\rB)\\}\\\\\n    v(\\rA\\supset\\rB)  &=  \\begin{cases}\n               v(\\rB)           & v(\\rA) <\nv(\\rB)\\\\\n               0               & \\text{otherwise}\n           \\end{cases}\\\\\n    v(\\bot) &= n-1\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nwith \\(\\dturnstile{S_n}\\rA\\) if \\(v(\\rA) = 0\\) for all assignments of\nvalues from \\(\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\) to atomic formulas.\n\n\\(S_2\\) is just the classical theory of truth. \\(S_3\\) was used above\nto demonstrate the independence of Frege\u2019s fifth axiom.\nG\u00f6del used the whole sequence in a demonstration that\nintuitionistic logic is not complete with respect to any finite-valued\ntruth-functional interpretation.\n\nBeyond such utilitarian roles, multi-valued logics have attracted\ninterest in their own right. Important examples are the (strong and\nweak) Kleene 3-valued logics, which are meant to assign truth values\nto propositions about partial recursive functions. Other 3-valued\nlogics have been proposed as improvements on the material conditional\nas interpretations of indicative mood conditionals (see Cobreros et al\n2014). 4-valued logics have been used to model computation on\ndatabases containing conflicting information\u2014here the values\ncorrespond with the information states \u201ctrue\u201d,\n\u201cfalse\u201d, \u201cboth\u201d, and \u201cneither\u201d\n(see Belnap 1977). Graham Priest 1992 has applied the same framework\nin the development of a system of relevance logic, again offering an\nimproved formalization of conditional language.\n\nAnother important class of multi-valued logics are the\ninfinitely-valued \u201cfuzzy logics\u201d. These have been used in\norder to provide an analysis of propositions with vague terms, which\ncan be thought of as admitting degrees of truth.\n3.2 Constructive logics\n\nWe have already noted that simply rejecting the lem\nleads to a subtle deviation from the classical\ninterpretation: The classical truth functional interpretation falls\naway, but the inferential definition of the connectives evident in\nnatural deduction can be preserved. The intuitionistic propositional\ncalculus ipc has been studied in great depth.\nAmong its prominent features are:\n\n1. The \u201cdisjunction property\u201d: the fact that\n\\(\\turnstile{\\IPC} \\rA\\vee\\rB\\) only if either \\(\\turnstile{\\IPC}\n\\rA\\) or \\(\\turnstile{\\IPC} \\rB\\). G\u00f6del (1932, 1933a) contain\nthe first observations that ipc has the\ndisjunction property. The first recorded proof is in Gentzen\n1934\u201335, where it is a trivial consequence of cut elimination\nfor pi: The only way a pi-\nproof can have the endsequent \\(\\Lrightarrow\n\\rA\\vee\\rB\\) is for the last inference to be a thinning(R) or\n\\(\\vee(\\rR)\\). If the inference were thinning(R), then the previous\nsequent would be \\(\\Lrightarrow\\). Because pi\nis consistent, that is impossible. Therefore, the previous sequent\nmust either be \\(\\Lrightarrow \\rA\\) or \\(\\Lrightarrow \\rB\\).\n\nAt one time it was conjectured that ipc can be\ncharacterized as the strongest propositional logic with the\ndisjunction property (an example of a weaker logic is\nJohansson\u2019s mpc, corresponding to the\npure system of natural deduction nd). In 1957,\nKreisel and Putnam studied the \u201cindependence of premises\n(IndPrem)\u201d inference \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$\\neg\\rA\\supset(\\rB\\vee\\rC)$}\\UnaryInfC{($\\neg\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\vee(\\neg\\rA\\supset\\rC)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nand observed that \n\\[\\neg\\rA\\supset(\\rB\\vee\\rC)\\centernot{\\turnstile{\\IPC}} (\\neg\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\vee(\\neg\\rA\\supset\\rC)\\]\n\n\nalthough the logic kp = ipc+IndPrem\nalso has the disjunction property. Today\nit is known that there are infinitely many distinct logical systems\nintermediate in strength between ipc and cpc,\nand that infinitely many of them have the\ndisjunction property.\n\n2. The failure of truth-functionality: The intuitive understanding of\nintuitionism is to replace the idealistic concept of truth with the\nnotion of having been constructively verified. Some authors suggested\nthat in the propositional case, this might lead to a 3-valued logic:\none value indicating that a statement was constructively verified,\nanother value indicating that it had been constructively refuted, and\na third value indicating that neither of these is the case. This seems\nat least to accord with ipc\u2019s rejection\nof lem. However, because there are only a\nsmall number of 3-valued semantic environments, others were able to\nrule out this possibility case-by case. This led to speculation that\nthe right semantics might have valence 4 or possibly 5.\nG\u00f6del\u2019s 1932 proof rules out all truth-functional\ninterpretations of any finite valence.\n\nBecause of the failure of truth-functionality, a new framework for\nunderstanding ipc validity is needed. Adequate\ntopological, algebraic, and Kripke-frame semantics have been\nintroduced, and completeness results demonstrating a correspondence\nbetween these frameworks and various proof systems abound. We have\nalready indicated that the completeness argument for the\nintuitionistic sequent calculus pi with\nrespect to Kripke frames is a variation of the simple constructive\ncompleteness theorem for pk with respect to\nthe classical theory of truth. Again, the argument shows that pi\nis decidable: Given a formula A, the algorithm\neither returns a pi-proof of A or a falsifying\nKripke frame.\n\nThere is also an informal, intuitive understanding of ipc\ntheoremhood called the BHK interpretation.\nAccording to this interpretation, the disjunction property is a formal\nanalogue of the definition of the \\(\\vee\\) symbol: To have a proof of\n\\(\\rA\\vee\\rB\\) just means that either \\(\\rA\\) or \\(\\rB\\) has been\nproved. In a similar fashion, to have a proof of \\(\\rA\\wedge\\rB\\)\nmeans that both \\(\\rA\\) and \\(\\rB\\) have been proved; a proof of\n\\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) is a construction that allows any proof of A to be\ntransformed into a proof of B; a proof of \\(\\neg\\rA\\) is a\nconstruction that allows any proof of A to be transformed into a proof\nof \\(\\bot\\). In this specification of the meanings of the connectives,\n\u201cprovability\u201d refers to informal provability by any means\nwhatsoever, rather than to formal provability within a specific\nsystem.\n\nBecause the BHK interpretation specifies, not what expressions like\n\\(\\rA\\vee\\rB\\) and \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) mean, but what it means to say\nthat such expressions are provable, the \\(\\supset\\) connective is\ntypically referred to in the intuitionistic setting as the\n\u201cimplication\u201d operator. This is sometimes misread as a\ndisagreement with the classical distinction between the conditional\nconnective and the implication relation. But as we have seen, on the\nclassical conception, too, the expression \\(\\vdash \\rA\\supset\\rB\\)\nrepresents implication, i.e., truth of the conditional claim on every\nassignment. On the intuitionistic conception, however, the connectives\nare understood primitively in terms of what it means for expressions\ngoverned by them to be provable. The same conception figures into the\nunderstanding of connectives in relevance logic, where again\n\\(\\supset\\) is typically described as an implication operator (and its\nclassical treatment is faulted for engendering the \u201cparadoxes of\nmaterial implication\u201d, not the \u201cparadoxes of material\nconditionalization\u201d.)\n\n3. A striking feature of ipc is the presence\nof inference rules like IndPrem that are not derivable \n\n\\[\\neg\\rA\\supset(\\rB\\vee\\rC) \\centernot{\\turnstile{\\IPC}} (\\neg\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\vee(\\neg\\rA\\supset\\rC)\\]\n\n\nbut that nevertheless preserve the property of ipc-provability.\nOther examples of such rules\nare \n\\[ \\begin{prooftree}\n \\AxiomC{$(\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\supset (\\rA\\vee\\rC)$}\n \\RightLabel{ Mints\u2019s rule}\n \\UnaryInfC{(($\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\supset\\rA)\\vee((\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\supset\\rC)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n \n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n  \\AxiomC{$(\\neg\\neg\\rA\\supset\\rA)\\supset (\\neg\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg\\rA)$}\n  \\RightLabel{ Rose\u2019s rule}\n  \\UnaryInfC{$\\neg\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg\\rA$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nIs it right to say that such rules are valid patterns of\nintuitionistic inference? The question is ambiguous in a way that\nexperience with classical logic desensitizes one to. For it can be\nshown that any rule that preserves the property of being a classical\nvalidity is also derivable in cpc itself. The\nfact that the rules under whose application the set of ipc\ntheorems is closed properly extends the ipc-derivable\nrules leads to a new concept: the\nformer rules are called \u201cadmissible\u201d. The intuitionsitic\nstudy of propositional logic thereby reveals a fundamental distinction\nin the basic concept of deductive validity, between a rule licensing\nlegitimate inferences from theorems and it applying also to arbitrary\nhypotheses.\n\nBecause the primitive understanding of logical connectives from the\nintuitionist perspective is in terms of the conditions of the\nprovability of statements containing them, one might, and many authors\nhave, maintained that admissibility is the proper precisification of\nthe concept of deductive validity for ipc. On\nthe other hand, what distinguishes ipc from\nmpc is the derivability of the rule ex\nfalso quodlibet. That rule (as well as the disjunctive syllogism)\nis admissible already in mpc, so the decision\nto include it explicitly as a derivable inference in ipc\nindicates some recognition of the importance of\nderivability. What can be said definitely is that the distinction\nbetween derivability and admissibility is important in constructive\nlogics in a way that it is not in cpc.\n\n4. Three of the De Morgan inferences are derivable in ipc,\nbut the inference\n\\(\\frac{\\neg(\\rA\\wedge\\rB)}{\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg\\rB}\\) is not. ipc\ntherefore serves as a background theory from\nwhich the strength of this inference can be measured. One might\nconjecture that ipc+\\(\\frac{\\neg(\\rA\\wedge\\rB)}{\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg\\rB}\\)\nis fully classical, but in fact this system still does not prove lem.\nIt does, however, prove the so-called weak law\nof excluded middle (wlem):\n\\(\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg\\neg\\rA\\). Moreover, all De Morgan\u2019s inferences\nare derivable in ipc+wlem,\nso that wlem and\n\\(\\frac{\\neg(\\rA\\wedge\\rB)}{\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg\\rB}\\) can be said to be\nequivalent over the base theory ipc. The logic\nipc+\\(\\frac{\\neg(\\rA\\wedge\\rB)}{\\neg\\rA\\vee\\neg\\rB}\\),\nsometimes called De Morgan logic or Jankov\u2019s logic, occupies a\nunique place in the hierarchy of systems intermediate in strength\nbetween ipc and cpc.\nIt has a natural realization in the Medvedev lattice of degrees of\nsolvability. The setting is Baire space \\(\\omega^\\omega\\) (the set of\nfunctions from \\(\\omega\\) to \\(\\omega\\)) and the problem of producing\nan element of a given subset of this space. Subsets of Baire space are\ncalled mass problems, and their elements are called solutions. One\nmass problem is said to reduce to another if there is an effective\nprocedure for transforming solutions of the second into solutions of\nthe first. If one defines the lattice \\(\\calM\\) of degrees of\nreducibility of mass problems, the set of identities of \\(\\calM\\)\ncorresponds to the set of theorems De Morgan logic (Sorbi 1991), so\nthat the theory of mass problems provides a constructive\ninterpretation of this logic. (This is like a constructive analogue to\nthe way switching circuits are a realization of cpc.)\nUnlike ipc, however,\nno rule admissible in De Morgan logic is underivable (Prucnal 1976).\nThus one sees that wlem, standing in the place\nof full lem, allows for a constructive\ninterpretation without exhibiting underivable admissible rules.\n\n5. We have observed how the Gentzen calculi highlight certain\nrelationships between ipc and cpc.\nTranslation schemes of Kolmogorov, Glivenko,\nG\u00f6del, and Gentzen make evident other relationships between these\nand other systems. We begin with a result of Val\u00e9rii Glivenko\n(1929):\n\n\nTheorem 6. If \\(\\turnstile{\\CPC}\\rA\\), then\n\\(\\turnstile{\\IPC}\\neg\\neg\\rA\\).\n\n\n\nProof.

But then \\(\\turnstile{\\IPC}\\neg\\neg\\rA\\)\nand \\(\\turnstile{\\IPC}\\neg\\rA\\).\n\n\nGlivenko\u2019s theorem provides a simple translation \\(t_\\rV\\) of\nclassical logic into intuitionistic logic defined by \\(t_\\rV (\\rA) =\n\\neg\\neg\\rA\\) for all formulas A. It is a translation in the sense\nthat \\(\\turnstile{\\CPC}\\rA\\) if, and only if,\n\\(\\turnstile{\\IPC}t_\\rV(\\rA\\)). This translation is limited in that it\ndoes not extend to quantification theory.

Unlike \\(t_\\rV\\), the schemes of\nKolmogorov and of G\u00f6del/Gentzen can be extended to quantifiers.\nThe latter can be further extended to theories of arithmetic and to\nset theory (see Troelstra & van Dalen 1988).\n\nIn 1933b, G\u00f6del provided similar translation from ipc\nto the modal logic S4.\nS4 is cpc\nsupplemented with a new primitive symbol\n\\(\\Box\\) so that, if A is a formula, then \\(\\Box\\rA\\) is a formula, a\nnew rule of inference\n\n\\(\\dfrac{\\rA}{\\Box\\rA}\\)\n\n\nand three new axioms\n\n\\(\\Box\\rA\\supset\\rA\\)\n\\(\\Box\\rA\\supset (\\Box (\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\supset\\Box\\rB)\\)\n\\(\\Box\\rA\\supset\\Box\\Box\\rA\\)\n\n\nG\u00f6del defined a translation \\(t_\\Box\\) of formulas from ipc\ninto the language of S4\nby:\n\n\\(t_\\Box(\\neg\\rA) \\text{ is } \\Box\\neg\\Box t_\\Box(\\rA)\\)\n\\(t_\\Box(\\rA\\supset\\rB) \\text{ is } \\Box t_\\Box(\\rA)\\supset\\Box\nt_\\Box(\\rB)\\)\n\\(t_\\Box(\\rA\\vee\\rB) \\text{ is } \\Box t_\\Box(\\rA)\\vee\\Box\nt_\\Box(\\rB)\\)\n\\(t_\\Box(\\rA\\wedge\\rB) \\text{ is } \\Box t_\\Box(\\rA)\\wedge\\Box\nt_\\Box(\\rB)\\)\n\n\nand stated, without proof:  \n\\[\\turnstile{\\IPC}\\rA \\text{ if, and only if, }\n\\turnstile{\\text{S4}} t_\\Box(\\rA).\\tag{*}\\]\n\n\nG\u00f6del further declared both that \u201cthe translation of\n\\(\\rA\\vee\\neg\\rA\\) is not derivable in S4\u201d\nand also that \u201cneither in\ngeneral is any formula of the form \\(\\Box\\rA\\vee\\Box\\rB\\) for which\nneither \\(\\Box\\rA\\) nor \\(\\Box\\rB\\) is already provable in S4\u201d:\n\n\\[\\turnstile{\\text{S4}}\\Box\\rA\\vee\\Box\\rB\n\\text{ only if either }\\turnstile{\\text{S4}}\\Box\\rA\n\\text{ or }\n\\turnstile{\\text{S4}}\\Box\\rB\\tag{**}\\]\n\n\n(*) and (**) together obviously entail the disjunction property for\nipc.\n3.3 Relevance and connexive logics\n\nReturning to the problem of approximating natural language\nexpressions, some writers have proposed overcoming the apparent\ninadequacies of the material conditional by stipulating stronger\nconditions on the truth of propositions of the form \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\).\nRelevance logicians suggest that many of the features exhibited by the\nmaterial conditional that seem like departures from speakers\u2019\nintuitions about the truth of conditional expressions stem from\nascriptions of truth to conditionals whose antecedents are irrelevant\nto their consequents. As a formal measure to ensure relevance, they\npropose a \u201cvariable sharing condition\u201d. Variable sharing\nis generally thought to be only a necessary condition for relevance,\nhowever, and the project of describing sufficient formal conditions is\nongoing.\n\nConnexive logicians aim instead to make good of the intuition that for\na conditional statement to be true, the negation of its consequent\nshould be incompatible with its antecedent. This requirement on the\ntruth of conditional statements has a formidable history, appearing in\nlogical manuscripts of the Stoic philosophers Chrysippus and Sextus\nEmpiricus and evidently garnering more support at the time than the\ncontrary opinion of Philo of Melaga. A related idea appears already in\nthe Prior Analytics, where Aristotle claimed that it is\nimpossible that if not A, then A. This, \u201cAristotle\u2019s\nthesis\u201d, can be formalized as \\(\\neg (\\neg\\rA\\supset\\rA)\\),\nwhich is obviously invalid both classically and intuitionistically.\nSometimes instead the formula \\(\\neg (\\rA\\supset\\neg\\rA)\\) is called\nAristotle\u2019s thesis. Systems of connexive logic accept both as\naxioms, as well as the principles\n\\((\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\supset\\neg(\\rA\\supset\\neg\\rB)\\) and\n\\((\\rA\\supset\\neg\\rB)\\supset\\neg(\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\), which purport to\nformalize the original idea attributed to Chrysippus above. (These\nlatter two principles are interderivable, over the base theory ipc,\nwith Aristotle\u2019s theses).\n\nBy including as theorems principles that are classically invalid, such\nlogics risk trivialization because of the maximality of cpc.\nSome approaches address this problem by\nrejecting classical principles such as the \\(\\wedge\\)-elimination rule\nof natural deduction, avoiding thereby any formula and its negation\nbeing theorems. Other approaches are \u201cparaconsistent\u201d,\ni.e., they allow theorems A and \\(\\neg\\rA\\) but do not allow the\nderivation of arbitrary formulas from this contradiction.\nParaconsistent approaches are often interpretable with the 4-valued\ntruth-assignment mentioned above.\n3.4 Linear logic\n\nIf many departures from the classical framework are motivated by\nwanting to study connectives that more closely approximate the truth\nconditions of ordinary language expressions, linear logic (introduced\nin Girard 1987) can be thought of as a push in the opposite direction.\nJust as Frege saw logical significance in the material conditional\ndespite (maybe even because of) its lack of correspondence with\nordinary \u201cif \u2026then\u201d statements for reasons internal\nto logical theory, linear logic can be thought of as an attempt to\ndiscover in the fine structure of formal logic those propositional\nconnectives that play specific inference-tracking roles that ordinary\nexpressions might be too crude to articulate.\n\nWe saw earlier how in the sequent calculus classical and\nintuitionistic logic differ not in the inference rules governing the\npropositional connectives but in the background structure of\nreasoning\u2014specifically, in the presence or absence of multiple\nformulas in succedents. Linear logic analyzes this relationship\nfurther through adjustments to other structural aspects of reasoning.\nIt is well known that the operational rules of pk\ncan be written either in a\n\u201ccontext-sharing\u201d or \u201ccontext-independent\u201d\nform. The operational rules were given a context-sharing presentation\nabove, but for example the rule \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n  \\def\\fCenter{\\Lrightarrow}\n\\Axiom$\\Gamma\\fCenter \\Theta, \\rA$\n\\Axiom$\\rB, \\Gamma\\fCenter \\Theta$\n\\RightLabel{\\({{\\supset}\\text{(L)-cs}}\\)}\n\\BinaryInf$\\rA \\supset \\rB, \\Gamma\\fCenter \\Theta$\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\ncould instead be given a context-independent presentation:\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n  \\def\\fCenter{\\Lrightarrow}\n\\Axiom$\\Gamma\\fCenter \\Theta, \\rA$\n\\Axiom$\\rB, \\Delta\\fCenter \\Lambda$\n\\RightLabel{\\({\\supset}\\text{(L)-ci}\\)}\n\\BinaryInf$\\rA \\supset \\rB, \\Gamma, \\Delta\\fCenter \\Lambda, \\Theta$\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe equivalence of these presentations is easy to verify:\n\n\\[\n\\xlongequal[{\\Large \\rA \\,\\supset\\, \\rB, \\Gamma \\,\\Lrightarrow\\, \\Theta}]\n{\\Large\n    \\begin{prooftree}\n    \\def\\fCenter{\\Lrightarrow}\n    \\Axiom$\\Gamma\\fCenter \\Theta, \\rA$\n    \\Axiom$\\rB, \\Gamma\\fCenter \\Theta$\n    \\BinaryInf$\\rA \\,\\supset\\, \\rB, \\Gamma, \\Gamma \\fCenter \\Theta, \\Theta$\n    \\end{prooftree} }\n\\raise 1.6em {{\\supset}\\text{(L)-ci}}\n\\kern -3.5em \\text{\\}exchanges and contractions}\n\\]\n \n\\[\\frac{\n  \\xlongequal[{\\Large \\Gamma,\\Delta \\,\\Lrightarrow\\, \\Lambda,\\Theta,\\rA}]{{\\Large \\Gamma \\,\\Lrightarrow\\, \\Theta,\\rA}} \n\\text{\\}thinnings and exchanges\\{}\n  \\xlongequal[{\\Large\\rB,\\Gamma, \\Delta \\,\\Lrightarrow\\, \\Lambda,\\Theta}]{{\\Large \\rB, \\Delta \\,\\Lrightarrow\\, \\Lambda}} \n}{\n \\rA \\supset \\rB, \\Gamma, \\Delta \\,\\Lrightarrow\\, \\Lambda, \\Theta\n}\n{\\supset}\\text{(L)-cs}\n\\]\n\n\nbut we see that their equivalence depends on the presence of the\nstructural rules thinning and contraction.\n\nIn propositional linear logic, there are two conjunction-like\noperators, \\(\\otimes\\) and \\(\\amp\\), and two disjunction-like\noperators \\(\\oplus\\) and \\(\\parr\\). \\(\\oplus\\) is given a\ncontext-sharing left rule and a right rule with \u201cbuilt-in\nthinning\u201d like the intuitionistic version of \\(\\vee(\\rR)\\).\n\\(\\parr\\) is its structural dual: its left rule is context-independent\nand its right rule is just like the classical \\(\\vee(\\rR)\\).\nSimilarly, \\(\\otimes(\\rR)\\) is context-independent and \\(\\otimes\\)(L)\nis just like the classical \\(\\wedge\\)(L), whereas \\(\\&(\\rR)\\) is\ncontext-sharing and \\(\\&\\)(L) has built in thinning. The\nconnectives \\(\\&\\) and \\(\\oplus\\) with context-sharing rules are\ncalled \u201cadditives\u201d; \\(\\otimes\\) and \\(\\parr\\) with\ncontext-independent rules are called \u201cmultiplicatives\u201d.\nBut there are no structural rules for thinning and contraction, so the\nadditive and multiplicative rules are not equivalent.\n\nDisambiguating the logical conjunction and disjunction into additive\nand multiplicative versions lends great perspicuity to the\nrelationship between classical and intuitionistic logic. For example,\nthere are two versions of lem. The additive\nversion \\(\\rA\\oplus\\neg\\rA\\) can be thought of as based on the\nintuitionsitic disjunction: Since neither of its disjuncts is\nprovable, neither is it. The multiplicative version\n\\(\\rA\\parr\\neg\\rA\\), on the other hand, corresponds to the classical\nunderstanding and is readily provable (\u201clinear\nimplication\u201d \\(\\rA\\multimap\\rB\\) is defined as\n\\(\\neg\\rA\\parr\\rB\\), so the multiplicative lem\ncorresponds with the linear identity \\(\\rA\\multimap\\rA\\)).\n\nIn the absence of contraction and weakening, formulas of linear logic\nstand for something more like resources than permanent statements or\nconstructions. Just as intuitionistic logic replaced the classical\nunderstanding of a conditional \\(\\rA\\supset\\rB\\) \u201ceither A is\nfalse or B is true\u201d with a procedural claim \u201cGiven A, I\ncan produce B\u201d, linear logic is able to distinguish claims\n\u201cGiven one copy of A, I can produce one copy of B\u201d from\n\u201cGiven three copies of A, I can produce one copy of B\u201d.\nThis allows modeling of propositions about resource use in\ncomputation, and much of the attention directed towards linear logic\nhas arisen because of its natural realization in computational models\nsuch as Petri nets.\n\nThe fragment of linear logic presented so far is called mall\n(for multiplicative/additive linear logic). In\norder to preserve its distinctive properties but also be able to\nexpress claims interpretable as, for example, the intuitionistic\nimplication, the linear modalities are introduced. These are unary\nconnectives for which restricted forms of weakening and contraction\napply. They are called \u201cmodalities\u201d for a reason, though:\nThey are governed by the same left and right rules as the necessity\nand possibility operators of modal logic S4.\nThis makes it unclear whether full linear\nlogic ll with their inclusion qualifies as a\npropositional logic.\n\nThis is no fault of linear logic, but rather one of its main\ncontributions to the study of propositions. As stressed in the\nintroduction to this article, a helpful attitude for the development\nof propositional logic is to bracket questions about the nature of\npropositions and simply require that the propositional connectives\nreturn expressions of the same order as those they operate on. From\nthis perspective, the idea of \u201cpersistent factual truth\u201d\nor \u201creusable construction\u201d, which is the basic starting\npoint of classical and intuitionistic logic, is related to linear\nlogic\u2019s basic unit of \u201climited resource\u201d just as the\nmodalities \u201cnecessary truth\u201d and \u201cpossible\ntruth\u201d are related to the category of \u201cpersistent factual\ntruth\u201d or \u201creusable construction\u201d.\n",
