    "main_text": "Elements of Capacity\n4. Elements of Capacity\n\nDespite the fact that aspects of the concept of decisional capacity\nremain unspecified and undeveloped, it is possible to identify some\nshared elements that all or almost all theorists agree must be part of\nthe picture. Four sub-capacities are most prominent. These are (1)\nChoice, (2) Understanding, (3) Appreciation, and (4) Reasoning. Some\ntheorists have also suggested the need for something like (5) Value or\nAbility to Value (discussed in\n \u00a76.1)\n and still others have posited the need for (6) Authenticity (also\ndiscussed in\n \u00a76.1).\n Below is a presentation of the most basic and agreed upon elements\nand an explanation of how these have come to be understood in\npractice.\n",
