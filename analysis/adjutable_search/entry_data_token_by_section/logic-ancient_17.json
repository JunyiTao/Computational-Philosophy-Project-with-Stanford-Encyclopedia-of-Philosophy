    "main_text": "The Stoics || Stoic Syllogistic\n5.4 Stoic Syllogistic\n\n\nIn terms of contemporary logic, Stoic syllogistic is best understood\nas a substructural backwards-working Gentzen-style natural-deduction\nsystem that consists of five kinds of axiomatic arguments (the\nindemonstrables) and four inference rules, called themata. An\nargument is a syllogism precisely if it either is an indemonstrable or\ncan be reduced to one by means of the themata\n(D. L. 7.78). Thus syllogisms are certain kinds of formally valid\narguments. The Stoics explicitly acknowledged that there are valid\narguments that are not syllogisms; but assumed that these could be\nsomehow transformed into syllogisms.\n\n\nAll basic indemonstrables consist of a non-simple assertible as\nleading premiss and a simple assertible as co-assumption, and have\nanother simple assertible as conclusion. They were defined by five\nstandardized meta-linguistic descriptions of the forms of the\narguments (S. E. M 8.224\u20135; D. L. 7.80\u20131):\n\n A first indemonstrable is an argument that concludes from a\nconditional and its antecedent the consequent <of the\nconditional> \n A second indemonstrable is an argument that concludes from a\nconditional and the contradictory of the consequent the contradictory\nof the antecedent <of the conditional>. \n A third indemonstrable is an argument that concludes from the\nnegation of a conjunction and one of the conjuncts the contradictory\nof the other conjunct.\n A fourth indemonstrable is an argument that concludes from a\ndisjunction and one of the disjuncts the contradictory of the other\ndisjunct.\n A fifth indemonstrable is an argument that concludes from a\ndisjunction and the contradictory of one of its disjuncts the other\ndisjunct.\n\n\n\nWhether an argument is an indemonstrable can be tested by comparing\nit with these meta-linguistic descriptions. For instance,\n\n\nIf it is day, it is not the case that it is night.\n But it is night.\n Therefore it is not the case that it is day.\n\n\n\n\ncomes out as a second indemonstrable, and\n\n\nIf five is a number, then either five is odd or five is even.\n But five is a number.\n Therefore either five is odd or five is even.\n\n\n\n\nas a first indemonstrable. For testing, a suitable mode of an argument\ncan also be used as a stand-in. A mode is syllogistic, if a\ncorresponding argument with the same form is a syllogism (because of\nthat form). However in Stoic logic there are no five modes that can be\nused as inference schemata that represent the five types of\nindemonstrables. For example, the following are two of the many modes\nof fourth indemonstrables:\n\nEither the 1st or the 2nd.\nBut the 2nd.\nTherefore not the 1st.\n\nEither the 1st or not the 2nd.\nBut the 1st.\nTherefore the 2nd.\n\n\n\nAlthough both are covered by the meta-linguistic description, neither\ncould be singled out as the mode of the fourth\nindemonstrables: If we disregard complex arguments, there are\nthirty-two modes corresponding to the five meta-linguistic\ndescriptions; the latter thus prove noticeably more economical. The\nalmost universal assumption among historians of logic that the Stoics\nrepresented their five (types of) indemonstrables by five modes is\nfalse and not supported by textual \nevidence.[4]\n\n\nOf the four themata, only the first and third are extant.\nThey, too, were meta-linguistically formulated. The first\nthema, in its basic form, was:\n\n When from two [assertibles] a third follows, then from\neither of them together with the contradictory of the conclusion the\ncontradictory of the other follows (Apuleius\nInt. 209.9\u201314).\n\n\n\nThis is an inference rule of the kind today called antilogism. The\nthird thema, in one formulation, was:\n\nWhen from two [assertibles] a third follows, and from the\none that follows [i.e. the third] together with another,\nexternal assumption, another follows, then this other follows from the\nfirst two and the externally co-assumed one (Simplicius Cael.\n237.2\u20134).\n\n\n\nThis is an inference rule of the kind today called cut-rule. It is\nused to reduce chain-syllogisms. The second and fourth\nthemata were also cut-rules, and reconstructions of them can\nbe provided, since we know what arguments they together with the third\nthema were thought to reduce, and we have some of the\narguments said to be reducible by the second thema. A\npossible reconstruction of the second thema is:\n\nWhen from two assertibles a third follows, and from the third and\none (or both) of the two another follows, then this other follows from\nthe first two.\n\n\n\nA possible reconstruction of the fourth thema is:\n\nWhen from two assertibles a third follows, and from the third and\none (or both) of the two and one (or more) external assertible(s)\nanother follows, then this other follows from the first two and the\nexternal(s). (Cf. Bobzien 1996.)\n\n\n\nA Stoic reduction shows the formal validity of an argument by applying\nto it the themata in one or more steps in such a way that all\nresultant arguments are indemonstrables. This can be done either with\nthe arguments or their modes (S. E. M\n8.230\u20138). For instance, the argument mode\n\n\nIf the 1st and the 2nd, the 3rd.\n But not the 3rd.\n Moreover, the 1st.\n Therefore not: the 2nd.\n\n\n\n\ncan be reduced by the third thema to (the modes of) a second\nand a third indemonstrable as follows:\n\n\nWhen from two assertibles (\u2018If the 1st and the\n2nd, the 3rd\u2019 and \u2018But not the\n3rd\u2019) a third follows (\u2018Not: both the\n1st and the 2nd\u2019\u2014this follows by a\nsecond indemonstrable) and from the third and an external one\n(\u2018The 1st\u2019) another follows (\u2018Not: the\n2nd\u2019\u2014this follows by a third indemonstrable),\nthen this other (\u2018Not: the 2nd\u2019) also follows\nfrom the two assertibles and the external one.\n\n\nThe second thema reduced, among others, arguments with the\nfollowing modes (Alex. Aphr. An. Pr. 164.27\u201331):\n\n\nEither the 1st or not the 1st.\nBut the 1st.\nTherefore the 1st.\n\n\nIf the 1st, if the 1st, the 2nd.\nBut the 1st.\nTherefore the 2nd.\n\n\n\nThe Peripatetics chided the Stoics for allowing such useless\narguments. In agreement with contemporary logic, the Stoics insisted\nthat, if the arguments can be reduced, they are valid.\n\n\nThe four themata can be used repeatedly and in any\ncombination in a reduction. Thus propositional arguments of\nindeterminate length and complexity can be reduced. Stoic syllogistic\nhas been formalized, and it has been shown that the Stoic deductive\nsystem shows strong similarities with relevance logical systems like\nthose by Storrs McCall. Like Aristotle, the Stoics aimed at proving\nnon-evident formally valid arguments by reducing them by\nmeans of accepted inference rules to evidently valid\narguments. Thus, although their logic is a propositional\nlogic, they did not intend to provide a system that allows for the\ndeduction of all propositional-logical truths, but rather a system of\nvalid propositional-logical arguments with at least two premises and a\nconclusion. Nonetheless, we have evidence that the Stoics expressly\nrecognized many simple logical truths. For example, they accepted the\nfollowing logical principles: the principle of double negation,\nstating that a double negation (\u2018not: not: p\u2019) is\nequivalent to the assertible that is doubly negated (i.e. p)\n(D. L. 7.69); the principle that any conditional formed by using the\nsame assertible as antecedent and as consequent (\u2018if p,\np\u2019) is true (S. E. M 8.281, 466); the principle\nthat any two-place disjunctions formed by using contradictory\ndisjuncts (\u2018either p or not: p\u2019) is true\n(S. E. M 8.282, 467); and the principle of contraposition,\nthat if \u2018if p, q\u2019 then \u2018if not:\nq, not: p\u2019 (D. L. 7.194, Philodemus\nSign., PHerc. 1065, XI.26\u2013XII.14).\n",
