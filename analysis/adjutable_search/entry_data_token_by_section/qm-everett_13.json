    "main_text": "The Bare Theory and Extensions || The Bare Theory\n8.1 The Bare Theory\n\nThe bare theory is pure wave mechanics with the standard\ninterpretation of states (rule 3). This approach takes seriously\nEverett\u2019s proposal of simply dropping the collapse dynamics\n(rule 4b) from the standard theory then try to derive the standard\ntheory\u2019s predictions as subjective experiences from the\nresulting theory. Inasmuch as the bare theory is arguably identical to\npure wave mechanics, studying it is a good way to assess the virtues\nand vices of Everett\u2019s proposal. It is also a good first step in\nfiguring out what auxiliary assumptions are needed in order to get a\nstraightforward account of determinate records and forward-looking\nquantum probabilities starting from pure wave mechanics. See Albert\nand Loewer (1988), Albert (1992), and Barrett (1994) for a description\nof the bare theory and Geroch (1984) for a similar reading of\nEverett.\n\nOn the bare theory there is no distinction between absolute and\nrelative states nor is there any special notion of typicality. Rather,\none uses Everett\u2019s model of an idealized observer to argue that\nit would appear to such observers that they had the perfectly\ndeterminate measurement outcomes predicted by the collapse dynamics\nwhen they in fact did not. The thought is that this is one way of\ncapturing Everett\u2019s goal of deducing the standard predictions of\nquantum mechanics as the subjective appearances of observers who are\nthemselves treated within the theory. We have already seen the basic\nargument in section 5.2. We will start by briefly reviewing how it\ngoes in a slightly more general setup.\n\nSince \\(J\\) would report that she had a determinate result in\npost-measurement state: \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\nup}\\rangle_S\\]\n\n\nand would report that she had a determinate result in post-measurement\nstate: \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rangle_S\\]\n\n\n\\(J\\) would, by the linearity of the dynamics, also report that she\ngot a perfectly determinate result, either spin up or spin down, in\nthe post-measurement state \\(J\\) gets when observing \\(S\\) in\nstate \n\\[\n\\alpha|\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S + \\beta|\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rangle_S.\\]\n\n\nAssuming that she perfectly correlates her record with the \\(x\\)-spin\nof \\(S\\) in a way that does not disturb its spin, then on the linear\ndynamics (rule 4a), the resultant post-measurement state in this case\nis \n\\[\\alpha|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\nup}\\rangle_S + \\beta|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S.\\]\n\n\nIf asked in this state \\(J\\) would be in a superposition of reporting\n\u201cI got a determinate result, either spin up or spin down\u201d\nin the first branch and reporting \u201cI got a determinate result,\neither spin up or spin down\u201d in the second branch, which is an\neigenstate of reporting \u201cI got a determinate result, either spin\nup or spin down.\u201d Hence, if we assume that her reports are in\nfact true of her experience, it would appear to \\(J\\) that\nshe got a perfectly determinate ordinary measurement result even when\nshe did not determinately get \u201cspin up\u201d and she did not\ndeterminately get \u201cspin down\u201d. One might think of this as\na disjunctive experience. The disjunctive experience is not\nan experience of either ordinary determinate result, but it is one\nwhere the observer is convinced that her result is\n\u201cdeterminately spin up or determinately spin\ndown\u201d.\n\nOne can similarly argue from the linear dynamics and the properties of\nan ideal observer that if \\(J\\) repeats her spin measurement, then she\nwill end up with the sure-fire disposition to report that she got the\nsame result for the second measurement as for the first, even when she\ndid not in fact get an ordinary determinate result for either. As a\nresult, it will appear to her that there has been a collapse of the\nquantum-mechanical state when in fact there has been no collapse,\nsplitting of worlds, or anything else that would produce an ordinary\ndeterminate measurement record. The subjective appearance of a\ncollapse here is an illusion produced by the linear dynamics. It\nrepresents her inability to distinguish between ordinary and\ndisjunctive experience.\n\nThe linear dynamics also entails intersubjective agreement between\ndifferent observers. If a second observer were to check \\(J\\)\u2019s\nmeasurement result, the second observer would end up believing that\nhis result agreed with her result, even when neither observer in fact\nhas an ordinary determinate measurement record. In this sense, there\nis subjective agreement on the apparent result of the apparent\ncollapse.\n\nFinally, one can show that an observer who repeats a measurement on an\ninfinite sequence of systems in the same initial state will approach a\nstate where she has the sure-fire dispositions to report that her\nmeasurement results were randomly distributed with the standard\nquantum statistics, even when she in fact got no ordinary results for\nany of her measurements. This follows from the relative frequency and\nrandomness results in section 3.2. Hence she will end up believing\nthat she got a determinate measurement result to each measurement and\nthat these results were distributed precisely as one would expect on\nthe standard collapse dynamics. See Everett (1956, 129\u201330),\n(1955, 67), (1956, 121\u20133 and 130\u20133), and (1957,\n186\u20138 and 194\u20135) for his discussions of these formal\nproperties of pure wave mechanics.\n\nWhile the bare theory has a number of suggestive properties, there are\nat least two serious problems. To begin, it is not empirically\ncoherent. If the bare theory were true, it would be impossible to have\nempirical evidence for accepting it as true given the radical sort of\nillusions it predicts. See Barrett (1996) for a discussion of\nempirical coherence in the context of the bare theory and John\nBell\u2019s (1981, 133\u20137) Everett (?) theory. Another is that\nif the bare theory were true, one would most likely fail to have any\ndeterminate beliefs at all since, on the linear dynamics, one would\nexpect the global state to almost never be an eigenstate of any\nparticular observer being sentient or even existing. For a further\ndiscussion of how experience is supposed to work in the bare theory\nand some the problems it encounters see Albert (1992), Bub, Clifton,\nand Monton, (1998), and Barrett (1999 and 2020).\n",
