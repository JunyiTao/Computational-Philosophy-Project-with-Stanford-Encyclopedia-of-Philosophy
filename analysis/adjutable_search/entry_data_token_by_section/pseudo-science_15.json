Two forms of pseudo-science\n\nSome forms of pseudoscience have as their main objective the promotion\nof a particular theory of their own, whereas others are driven by a\ndesire to fight down some scientific theory or branch of science. The\nformer type of pseudoscience has been called pseudo-theory\npromotion, and the latter science denial(ism) (Hansson\n2017). Pseudo-theory promotion is exemplified by homeopathy,\nastrology, and ancient astronaut theories.  The term\n\u201cdenial\u201d was first used about the pseudo-scientific claim\nthat the Nazi holocaust never took place. The phrase \u201cholocaust\ndenial\u201d was in use already in the early 1980s (Gleberzon\n1983). The term \u201cclimate change denial\u201d became common\naround 2005 (e.g. Williams 2005). Other forms of science denial are\nrelativity theory denial, tobacco disease denial, hiv denialism, and\nvaccination denialism.\n\nMany forms of pseudoscience combine pseudo-theory promotion with\nscience denialism. For instance, creationism and its skeletal version\n\u201cintelligent design\u201d are constructed to support a\nfundamentalist interpretation of Genesis. However, as practiced today,\ncreationism has a strong focus on the repudiation of evolution, and it\nis therefore predominantly a form of science denialism.\n\nThe most prominent difference between pseudo-theory promotion and\nscience denial is their different attitudes to conflicts with\nestablished science. Science denialism usually proceeds by producing\nfalse controversies with legitimate science, i.e. claims that there is\na scientific controversy when there is in fact none. This is an old\nstrategy, applied already in the 1930s by relativity theory deniers\n(Wazeck 2009, 268\u2013269). It has been much used by tobacco disease\ndeniers sponsored by the tobacco industry (Oreskes and Conway 2010;\nDunlap and Jacques 2013), and it is currently employed by climate\nscience denialists (Boykoff and Boykoff 2004; Boykoff 2008). However,\nwhereas the fabrication of fake controversies is a standard tool in\nscience denial, it is seldom if ever used in pseudo-theory\npromotion. To the contrary, advocates of pseudosciences such as\nastrology and homeopathy tend to describe their theories as\nconformable to mainstream science.\n",
