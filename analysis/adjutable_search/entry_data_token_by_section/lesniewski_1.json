    "main_text": "Early Works\n2. Early Works\n\n Le\u015bniewski\u2019s early writings are all papers on topics in\nthe philosophy of logic and language, concerned with such issues as\ntruth, denotation and connotation, the status of the laws of logic, and\nRussell\u2019s Antinomy. The primary influences in this period were\nJohn Stuart Mill, Anton Marty, and Edmund Husserl: he himself described\nthe works as grammatical in nature. Although Le\u015bniewski later\nrepudiated his early works, they contain many seeds of his later\ninterests, attitudes, and working practices. From the beginning there\nis an obsessive rigor in developing logical principles, including an\ninstinctively clear and consistent marking of the use/mention\ndistinction, that is, distinguishing talk in a language from talk about\na language. Le\u015bniewski\u2019s early works are mainly reactions to\nwork by others, whether Brentano and Cornelius on existential\npropositions, \u0141ukasiewicz on the Principles of Contradiction and\nExcluded Middle, Twardowski on universals, or Kotarbi\u0144ski on the\ntimelessness of truth.\n\n The turning point in this period came when in 1911 Le\u015bniewski read\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s groundbreaking 1910 monograph O zasadzie\nsprzeczno\u015bci u Arystotelesa [On the Principle of\nContradiction in Aristotle], a radical rethink of the status of the\nprinciple of contradiction in the light of modern logic. That work\ncontained an appendix in which there was a short exposition of modern\nsymbolic logic, in the notation of Couturat, and in Chapter 18 a brief\ndiscussion of Russell\u2019s antinomy of the set of sets which are not\nmembers of themselves. Le\u015bniewski initially thought the Russell\nAntinomy was easy to fix\u2014and while trying to fix it missed a\nonce-a-day train when changing stations in Russia. He spent the next\nyears perfecting his solution, and indeed the rest of his life was\ndevoted to providing a rigorous, antinomy-free foundation for\nmathematics which avoided both the sloppiness of Principia and\nwhat he considered the fiction of standard set theory.\n\n According to Le\u015bniewski\u2019s dissertation and first paper, all\npositive existential propositions are analytic. This sounds absurd, but\nLe\u015bniewski has reasons. Like Mill, he distinguishes between a\nterm\u2019s denotation, which is the object or objects it stands for,\nand its connotation, which is the property or properties it ascribes to\nsomething. A proposition is defined to be analytic if it is (1) in\npositive subject\u2013predicate form, and (2) contains no predicates\nconnoting properties not connoted by the subject. A proposition is\nsynthetic if it is (1) positive and (2) contains some predicate\nconnoting a property not connoted by the subject. Contrary to Mill, who\nsaid that \u2018being\u2019 connotes the property of existing,\nLe\u015bniewski thinks the predicate \u2018exist\u2019 does not\nconnote any properties. A fortiori, \u2018exist\u2019 used as a\npredicate connotes no property not contained in the subject. Negative\nexistential propositions, which have the form \u2018\\(X\\) is/are\nnon-existing\u2019 are synthetic, except for such whose subject\nconnotes non-existence, e.g. \u2018A square circle does not\nexist\u2019 does not, so it is synthetic, but \u2018All non-existing\nobjects are non-existing\u2019 is analytic. All negative existential\npropositions are contradictory, because every subject connotes\nsomething of the form \u2018being which possesses properties\n\\(A, B, C, D\\), etc.\u2019 Analytic\nnegative existentials have contradictory subjects. So instead of saying\n\u2018\\(X\\) exists\u2019 we should, to express the proposition\nwe want to be synthetic and contingent, rather say \u2018Some being is\nthe object \\(X\\)\u2019.\n\n Le\u015bniewski saves appearances, which are that some existential\npropositions are true and others are false, by proposing a normative\nschema that propositions should fulfill to be proper expressions of the\nthought intended. Every proposition is to represent the possessing by\nthe object(s) denoted by the subject of the properties connoted by the\npredicate. Sentences which fail to conform to this norm are improper or\ninadequate, and should be replaced by proper alternatives. For example\n\u2018People exist\u2019, which is true but is intended to be\nsynthetic, should be expressed as \u2018Some beings are people\u2019,\nwhile \u2018A square circle does not exist\u2019 should be expressed\nby \u2018No being is a square circle\u2019. Here is a table of some\nof the equivalences:\n\n\nInadequate Expression\nAdequate Alternative\n\n\nOnly objects \\(A\\) exist\nAll beings are objects \\(A\\)\n\n\nObjects \\(A\\) exist\nSome beings are objects \\(A\\)\n\n\nObject \\(A\\) exists\nOne (a certain) being is object \\(A\\)\n\n\nObject \\(A\\) does not exist \nObjects \\(A\\) do not exist\nNo being is a/the object \\(A\\)\n\n\n\n In \u201cAn Attempt at a Proof of the Ontological Principle of\nContradiction\u201d (1912) Le\u015bniewski argues that \u2018No\nobject is able to be both \\(B\\) and not\\(-B\\)\u2019 is true\nbut disagrees with the equivalence (now generally accepted) that\n\u2018No \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018If\nsomething is \\(A\\) then it is not \\(B\\)\u2019. The article\nis written in criticism of some ideas of \u0141ukasiewicz and it\nafforded the occasion for the first personal meeting of the two later\ncolleagues. \u0141ukasiewicz described the meeting decades later in a\npoignant diary entry for 9 May 1949:\n\n\nYesterday was the feast of St. Stanislaus, Bishop. This was\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s name day. On his last one he already lay in the\nsame hospital in which five days later he was to die. I met\nLe\u015bniewski in Lw\u00f3w in 1912. I lived then with my uncle in\n10, Chmielowski Street. One afternoon someone rang at the entrance\ndoor. I opened the door and I saw a young man with a light, pointed\nbeard, a hat with a wide brim and a big black cockade instead of a tie.\nThe young man bowed and asked politely: \u201cDoes Professor\n\u0141ukasiewicz live here?\u201d. I replied that it was so.\n\u201cAre you Professor \u0141ukasiewicz?\u201d asked the stranger. I\nreplied that it was so. \u201cI am Le\u015bniewski, and I have come to\nshow you the proofs of an article I have written against you.\u201d I\ninvited the man into my room. It turned out that Le\u015bniewski was\npublishing in Przegl\u0105d Filozoficzny an article containing\ncriticism of some my views in The Principle of Contradiction in\nAristotle. This criticism was written with such scientific\nexactness that I could not find any points which I could take up with\nhim. I remember that when, after hours of discussion, Le\u015bniewski\nparted from me, I went out as usual to the Kawiarnia Szkocka [Scottish\nCaf\u00e9, a favorite meeting-place for academics in Lw\u00f3w],\nand I declared to my colleagues waiting there that I would have to give\nup my logical interests. A firm had sprung up whose competition I was\nnot able to face. [Translated by Arianna Betti and Owen LeBlanc;\nsee Polish Philosophy Page: Stanislaw Lesniewski, in the\nOther Internet Resources section below]\n\n\n\n In \u201cThe Critique of the Logical Principle of the Excluded\nMiddle\u201d (1913) Le\u015bniewski distinguishes between an\nontological principle \u2013 Every object is either \\(A\\) or not\n\\(A\\) \u2013 and a logical principle \u2013 Of two\ncontradictory propositions, at least one must be true. He rejects the\nlatter because he takes \u2018Every centaur has a tail\u2019 and\n\u2018Some centaur does not have a tail\u2019 to be contradictories,\nbut both to be false because the subject-term \u2018centaur\u2019 is\nempty. This clearly depends on a reading of the universal with\nexistential import. If instead for the universal we take \u2018Any\ncentaur has a tail\u2019, which is true if there are no centaurs,\nthen we do get a contradictory pair with opposite truth-values.\n\n In the course of this paper Le\u015bniewski argues against\nTwardowski\u2019s theory of general objects and Meinong\u2019s theory\nof impossible objects, as well as offering solutions to the paradoxes\nof Grelling and the Liar. The paper is the richest of his early\n\u201clogico-grammatical\u201d works. The argument against Twardowski\ngoes as follows. Call a general object one which has all and\nonly the properties shared by some group of objects. For example the\ngeneral horse has all and only the properties shared by all horses: it\nis neither black nor brown nor white, neither male nor female, neither\nyoung nor old, but it is indisputably equine, mammalian, and born of\ntwo equine parents. Le\u015bniewski now reduces the definition to\nabsurdity. Of any group of at least two objects, there will be some\nproperty that some of them have that others do not have. For example,\nsome horses are black and others are not black. So the general horse is\nnot black, because some horses are not black; but nor is it not black,\nbecause some horses are not not black. Hence the general horse is\nneither black nor not black, which is a contradiction. Hence there are\nno general objects for groups of more than one thing. Le\u015bniewski\nliked this argument well enough to retain his allegiance to it even\nwhile repudiating all other parts of his early work; he rejected\nuniversals consistently thereafter. But the argument does not affect\nthose theories of universals which are happy to accept that universals\nmay have properties their instances do not, for example being\ninstantiated, or repeated.\n\n In \u201cIs truth only eternal or both eternal and without a\nbeginning?\u201d (1913) he argues for timeless bivalence against\nKotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s view that future contingent propositions lack\na determinate truth-value. This paper convinced Kotarbi\u0144ski he had\nbeen in error. The exchange is notable for showing that the discussion\nof the logical status of future contingent propositions, which inspired\n\u0141ukasiewicz to invent many-valued logic a few years later, was\nalready under way in Lw\u00f3w before the First World War.\n\n In \u201cIs the class of classes not subordinate to themselves\nsubordinate to itself?\u201d (1914) Le\u015bniewski offers his first\npublished analysis of Russell\u2019s Paradox, claiming that \u2018the\nclass of \\(A\\)s\u2019 refers to the unique mereological sum of\n\\(A\\)s, so that since every object is subordinate to itself, no\nclass of objects is not subordinate to itself, and Russell\u2019s\nParadox fails to arise. The non-standard term \u2018subordinate\nto\u2019 which he took from \u0141ukasiewicz, is defined by\nLe\u015bniewski as follows. An object \\(P\\) is subordinate to a\nclass \\(K\\) if and only if, for some a, \\(K\\) is a class of\n\\(a\\)s (a mereological sum of \\(a\\)s, as we shall see), and\n\\(P\\) is an \\(a\\). Let \\(P\\) be a hemispherical part of\na sphere \\(Q\\). The class of all hemispheres of \\(Q\\) is, on\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s understanding, simply \\(Q\\) itself, so\n\\(P\\) is subordinate to \\(Q\\). In fact, according to this\nview, any object is a class, and subordinate to itself. Le\u015bniewski\nretained this \u201cconcrete\u201d understanding of classes\nthroughout his life, claiming that it conformed to Cantor\u2019s own\nstatements. That other set theories gave a different account of things\nwas in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s view their problem, not his.\n\n During World War I, when Le\u015bniewski lived in Moscow, he completed\n\u201cFoundations of a General Theory of Sets I\u201d (1916). Despite\nthe use of the term \u2018mnogo\u015b\u0107\u2019 (set),\nthis was a first rigorous deductive presentation of the theory of\nparts, wholes and concrete collections. Le\u015bniewski later dropped\nthe term \u2018mnogo\u015b\u0107\u2019 and instead invented\nthe term \u2018Mereology\u2019, meaning \u2018theory of\nparts\u2019, an irregular coinage from the Greek\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, part, in order to\ndifferentiate his view from what he ironically called\n\u201cofficial\u201d set theory. In this paper the language is a\nhighly regimented Polish supplemented with variables, because at the\ntime Le\u015bniewski did not trust symbolic methods, having found the\nuse/mention confusions in Whitehead and Russell\u2019s Principia\nMathematica a barrier to understanding, and assuming any symbolic\nlogic had to be like that. Only later did Le\u015bniewski discover the\nmuch tidier work of Frege, which he thereafter held up as the foremost\nexample of symbolic logic to that date. Le\u015bniewski was one of the\nearliest logicians to appreciate the virtues of Frege\u2019s logical\nwork as largely independent of its inconsistency. In later years,\nLe\u015bniewski proved that Frege\u2019s \u201cway out\u201d of the\nparadox, which involved a restriction of the fatal abstraction\nprinciple Basic Law V, had the unacceptable consequence that there\ncould not be more than one object. This work was not published, but was\nreconstructed after World War II by Soboci\u0144ski (1949).\n",
