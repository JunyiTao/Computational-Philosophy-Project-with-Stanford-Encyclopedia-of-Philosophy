    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || What is territory?\n1.1 What is territory?\n\nOne common preliminary distinction is between territory and land. Land\nis that part of the earth\u2019s surface that is not covered by\nwater. Territory is a political and geographic concept. It refers to\nthe spatial area of jurisdictional authority. States have territory:\nit is the geographical extent of their jurisdictional authority. This\nusually covers the land within the borders of the state, but it can\nand does in the modern world extend off shore into the sea, below the\nearth\u2019s surface (to control resources) and above the\nearth\u2019s surface, as most states also claim jurisdiction over\ntheir air space. Territory, then, is not co-extensive with land,\nalthough all (or almost all) land on this planet is divided up into\ndifferent jurisdictional units, or territories. The critical geography\nliterature on \u2018territory\u2019 tends to primarily conceive of\n\u2018territory\u2019 as a geographical area that is controlled, or\nover which power is exercised (Elden 2013); whereas the political\nphilosophy literature tends to be more interested in territory as the\ndomain of legitimate jurisdictional control and associated rights\n(Miller 2012; Nine 2012; Banai 2014; Moore 2015; Angeli 2015; Stilz\n2019). Territory is also distinct from property as will be explained\nbelow.\n",
