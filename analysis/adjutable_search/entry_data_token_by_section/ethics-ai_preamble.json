    "main_text": "\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are digital technologies\nthat will have significant impact on the development of humanity in\nthe near future. They have raised fundamental questions about what we\nshould do with these systems, what the systems themselves should do,\nwhat risks they involve, and how we can control these.\n\nAfter the Introduction to the field (\u00a71), the main themes\n(\u00a72) of this article are: Ethical issues that arise with AI\nsystems as objects, i.e., tools made and used by humans. This\nincludes issues of privacy (\u00a72.1) and manipulation (\u00a72.2),\nopacity (\u00a72.3) and bias (\u00a72.4), human-robot interaction\n(\u00a72.5), employment (\u00a72.6), and the effects of autonomy\n(\u00a72.7). Then AI systems as subjects, i.e., ethics for\nthe AI systems themselves in machine ethics (\u00a72.8) and artificial\nmoral agency (\u00a72.9). Finally, the problem of a possible future AI\nsuperintelligence leading to a \u201csingularity\u201d (\u00a72.10).\nWe close with a remark on the vision of AI (\u00a73).\n\nFor each section within these themes, we provide a general explanation\nof the ethical issues, outline existing positions\nand arguments, then analyse how these play out with current\ntechnologies and finally, what policy consequences\nmay be drawn.\n",
