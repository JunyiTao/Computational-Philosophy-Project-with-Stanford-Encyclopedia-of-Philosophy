    "main_text": "Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? || Einstein\u2019s versions of the argument\n1.3 Einstein\u2019s versions of the argument\n\nIf the argument developed in EPR has its roots in the 1930 Solvay\nconference, Einstein\u2019s own approach to issues at the heart of EPR has\na history that goes back to the 1927 Solvay conference. (Bacciagaluppi\nand Valentini 2009, pp. 198\u2013202, would even trace it back to\n1909 and the localization of light quanta.) At that 1927 conference\nEinstein made a short presentation during the general discussion\nsession where he focused on problems of interpretation associated with\nthe collapse of the wave function. He imagines a situation where\nelectrons pass through a small hole and are dispersed uniformly in the\ndirection of a screen of photographic film shaped into a large\nhemisphere that surrounds the hole. On the supposition that quantum\ntheory offers a complete account of individual processes then, in the\ncase of localization, why does the whole wave front collapse to just\none single flash point? It is as though at the moment of collapse an\ninstantaneous signal were sent out from the point of collapse to all\nother possible collapse positions telling them not to flash. Thus\nEinstein maintains (Bacciagaluppi and Valentini 2009, p. 488),\n\nthe interpretation, according to which |\u03c8|\u00b2 expresses the\nprobability that this particle is found at a given point,\nassumes an entirely peculiar mechanism of action at a distance, which\nprevents the wave continuously distributed in space from producing an\naction in two places on the screen.\n\n\nOne could see this as a tension between local action and the\ndescription afforded by the wave function, since the wave function\nalone does not specify a unique position on the screen for detecting\nthe particle. Einstein continues,\n\nIn my opinion, one can remove this objection only in the following\nway, that one does not describe the process solely by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger wave, but that at the same time one localizes the\nparticle during propagation.\n\n\nIn fact Einstein himself had tried this very route in May of 1927\nwhere he proposed a way of \u201clocalizing the particle\u201d by\nassociating spatial trajectories and velocities with particle\nsolutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. (See Belousek 1996 and\nHolland 2005; also Ryckman 2017.) Einstein abandoned the project and\nwithdrew the draft from publication, however, after finding that\ncertain intuitive independence conditions were in conflict with the\nproduct wave function used by quantum mechanics to treat the\ncomposition of independent systems. The problem here anticipates the\nmore general issues raised by EPR over separability and composite\nsystems. This proposal was Einstein\u2019s one and only flirtation with the\nintroduction of hidden variables into the quantum theory. In the\nfollowing years he never embraced any proposal of that sort, although\nhe hoped for progress in physics to yield a more complete theory, and\none where the observer did not play a fundamental role. \u201cWe\nbelieve however that such a theory [\u201ca complete description of\nthe physical reality\u201d] is possible\u201d (p. 780). Commentators\nhave often mistaken that remark as indicating Einstein\u2019s predilection\nfor hidden variables. To the contrary, after 1927 Einstein regarded\nthe hidden variables project \u2014 the project of developing a more\ncomplete theory by starting with the existing quantum theory and\nadding things, like trajectories or real states \u2014 an improbable\nroute to that goal. (See, for example, Einstein 1953a.) To improve on\nthe quantum theory, he thought, would require starting afresh with\nquite different fundamental concepts. At Solvay he acknowledges Louis\nde Broglie\u2019s pilot wave investigations as a possible direction to\npursue for a more complete account of individual processes. But then\nhe quickly turns to an alternative way of thinking, one that he\ncontinued to recommend as a better framework for progress, which is\nnot to regard the quantum theory as describing individuals and their\nprocesses at all and, instead, to regard the theory as describing only\nensembles of individuals. Einstein goes on to suggest difficulties for\nany scheme, like de Broglie\u2019s and like quantum theory itself, that\nrequires representations in multi-dimensional configuration space.\nThese are difficulties that might move one further toward regarding\nquantum theory as not aspiring to a description of individual systems\nbut as more amenable to an ensemble (or collective) point of view, and\nhence not a good starting point for building a better, more complete\ntheory. His subsequent elaborations of EPR-like arguments are perhaps\nbest regarded as no-go arguments, showing that the existing\nquantum theory does not lend itself to a sensible realist\ninterpretation via hidden variables. If real states, taken as hidden\nvariables, are added into the existing theory, which is then tailored\nto explain individual events, the result is either an incomplete\ntheory or else a theory that does not respect locality. Hence, new\nconcepts are needed. With respect to EPR, perhaps the most important\nfeature of Einstein\u2019s reflections at Solvay 1927 is his insight that a\nclash between completeness and locality already arises in considering\na single variable (there, position) and does not require an\nincompatible pair, as in EPR.\n\nFollowing the publication of EPR Einstein set about almost immediately\nto provide clear and focused versions of the argument. He began that\nprocess within few weeks of EPR, in the June 19 letter to\nSchr\u00f6dinger, and continued it in an article published the\nfollowing year (Einstein 1936). He returned to this particular form of\nan incompleteness argument in two later publications (Einstein 1948\nand Schilpp 1949). Although these expositions differ in details they\nall employ composite systems as a way of implementing indirect\nmeasurements-at-a-distance. None of Einstein\u2019s accounts contains the\n Criterion of Reality\n nor the tortured EPR argument over when values of a quantity can be\nregarded as \u201celements of reality\u201d. The Criterion and these\n\u201celements\u201d simply drop out. Nor does Einstein engage in\ncalculations, like those of Podolsky, to fix the total wave function\nfor the composite system explicitly. Unlike EPR, none of Einstein\u2019s\narguments makes use of simultaneous values for complementary\nquantities like position and momentum. He does not challenge the\nuncertainty relations. Indeed with respect to assigning eigenstates\nfor a complementary pair he tells Schr\u00f6dinger \u201cist mir\nwurst\u201d\u2014literally, it\u2019s sausage to me; i.e., he couldn\u2019t\ncare less. (Fine 1996, p. 38). These writings probe an incompatibility\nbetween affirming locality and separability, on the one hand, and\ncompleteness in the description of individual systems by means of\nstate functions, on the other. His argument is that we can have at\nmost one of these but never both. He frequently refers to this dilemma\nas a \u201cparadox\u201d.\n\nIn the letter to Schr\u00f6dinger of June 19, Einstein points to a\nsimple argument for the dilemma which, like the argument from the 1927\nSolvay Conference, involves only the measurement of a single variable.\nConsider an interaction between the Albert and Niels systems that\nestablishes a strict correlation between their positions. (We need not\nworry about momentum, or any other quantity.) Consider the evolved\nwave function for the total (Albert+Niels) system when the two systems\nare far apart. Now assume a principle of locality-separability\n(Einstein calls it a Trennungsprinzip\u2014separation\nprinciple): Whether a determinate physical situation holds for Niels\u2019\nsystem (e.g., that a quantity has a particular value) does not depend\non what measurements (if any) are made locally on Albert\u2019s system. If\nwe measure the position of Albert\u2019s system, the strict correlation of\npositions implies that Niels\u2019 system has a certain position. By\nlocality-separability it follows that Niels\u2019 system must already have\nhad that position just before the measurement on Albert\u2019s system. At\nthat time, however, Niels\u2019 system alone does not have a state\nfunction. There is only a state function for the combined system and\nthat total state function does not single out an existing position for\nNiels\u2019 system (i.e., it is not a product one of whose factors is an\neigenstate for the position of Niels\u2019 system). Thus the description of\nNiels\u2019 system afforded by the quantum state function is incomplete. A\ncomplete description would say (definitely yes) if a quantity of\nNiels\u2019 system had a certain value. (Notice that this argument does not\neven depend on the reduction of the total state function for the\ncombined system.) In this formulation of the argument it is clear that\nlocality-separability conflicts with\n the eigenvalue-eigenstate link,\n which holds that a quantity of a system has a value if and only if\nthe state of the system is an eigenstate (or a proper mixture of\neigenstates) of that quantity with that value as eigenvalue. The\n\u201conly if\u201d part of the link would need to be weakened in\norder to interpret quantum state functions as complete descriptions.\n(See the entry on\n Modal Interpretations\n and see Gilton 2016 for a history of the eigenvalue-eigenstate\nlink.)\n\nThis argument rests on the ordinary and intuitive notion of\ncompleteness as not omitting relevant truths. Thus, in the argument,\nthe description given by the state function of a system is judged\nincomplete when it fails to attribute a position to the system in\ncircumstances where the system indeed has a position. Although this\nsimple argument concentrates on what Einstein saw as the essentials,\nstripping away most technical details and distractions, he frequently\nused another argument involving more than one quantity. (It is\nactually buried in the EPR paper, p. 779, and a version also occurs in\nthe June 19, 1935 letter to Schr\u00f6dinger. Harrigan and Spekkens,\n2010 suggest reasons for preferring a many-variables argument.) This\nsecond argument focuses clearly on the interpretation of quantum state\nfunctions in terms of \u201creal states\u201d of a system, and not\non any issues about simultaneous values (real or not) for\ncomplementary quantities. It goes like this.\n\nSuppose, as in EPR, that the interaction between the two systems links\nposition and also linear momentum, and that the systems are far apart.\nAs before, we can measure either the position or the momentum of\nAlbert\u2019s system and, in either case, we can infer (respectively) a\nposition or a momentum for Niels\u2019 system. It follows from the\nreduction of the total state function that, depending on whether we\nmeasure the position or the momentum of Albert\u2019s system, Niels\u2019 system\nwill be left (respectively) either in a position eigenstate or in a\nmomentum eigenstate. Suppose too that separability holds, so that\nNiels\u2019 system has some real physical state of affairs. If locality\nholds as well, then the measurement of Albert\u2019s system does not\ndisturb the assumed \u201creality\u201d for Niels\u2019 system. However,\nthat reality appears to be represented by quite different state\nfunctions, depending on which measurement of Albert\u2019s system one\nchooses to carry out. If we understand a \u201ccomplete\ndescription\u201d to rule out that one and the same physical state\ncan be described by state functions with distinct physical\nimplications, then we can conclude that the quantum mechanical\ndescription is incomplete. Here again we confront a dilemma between\nseparability-locality and completeness. Many years later Einstein put\nit this way (Schilpp 1949, p. 682);\n\n[T]he paradox forces us to relinquish one of the following two\nassertions:\n\n(1) the description by means of the psi-function is complete\n\n(2) the real states of spatially separate objects are independent of\neach other.\n\n\nIt appears that the central point of EPR was to argue that any\ninterpretation of quantum state functions that attributes real\nphysical states to systems faces these alternatives. It also appears\nthat Einstein\u2019s different arguments make use of different notions of\ncompleteness. In the first argument completeness is an ordinary notion\nthat amounts to not leaving out any relevant details. In the second,\ncompleteness is a technical notion which has been dubbed\n\u201cbijective completeness\u201c (Fine 1996 ): no more than one\nquantum state should correspond to a real state. These notions are\nconnected. If completeness fails in the bijective sense, and more than\none quantum state corresponds to some real state, we can argue that\nthe ordinary notion of completeness also fails. For distinct quantum\nstates will differ in the values they assign to certain quantities.\n(For example, the observable corresponding to the projector on a state\ntakes value 1 in one case but not in the other.) Hence each will omit\nsomething that the other affirms, so completeness in the ordinary\nsense will fail. Put differently, ordinary completeness implies\nbijective completeness. (The converse is not true. Even if the\ncorrespondence of quantum states to real states were one-to-one, the\ndescription afforded by a quantum state might still leave out some\nphysically relevant fact about its corresponding real state.) Thus a\ndilemma between locality and \u201ccompleteness\u201c in Einstein\u2019s\nversions of the argument still implicates ordinary completeness. For\nif locality holds, then his two-variable argument shows that bijective\ncompleteness fails, and then completeness in the ordinary sense fails\nas well.\n\nAs we have seen, in framing his own EPR-like arguments for the\nincompleteness of quantum theory, Einstein makes use of\n separability\n and\n locality,\n which are also tacitly assumed in the EPR paper. Using the language\nof \u201cindependent existence\u201c he presents these ideas clearly\nin an article that he sent to Max Born (Einstein 1948). \n\nIt is \u2026 characteristic of \u2026 physical objects that they\nare thought of as arranged in a space-time continuum. An essential\naspect of this arrangement \u2026 is that they lay claim, at a\ncertain time, to an existence independent of one another, provided\nthese objects \u201care situated in different parts of space\u201d.\n\u2026 The following idea characterizes the relative independence of\nobjects (A and B) far apart in space: external influence on A has no\ndirect influence on B. (Born, 1971, pp. 170\u201371)\n\n\nIn the course of his correspondence with Schr\u00f6dinger, however,\nEinstein realized that assumptions about separability and locality\nwere not necessary in order to get the incompleteness conclusion that\nhe was after; i.e., to show that state functions may not provide a\ncomplete description of the real state of affairs with respect to a\nsystem. Separability supposes that there is a real state of affairs\nand locality supposes that one cannot influence it immediately by\nacting at a distance. What Einstein realized was that separability was\nalready part of the ordinary conception of a macroscopic object. This\nsuggested to him that if one looks at the local interaction of a\nmacro-system with a micro-system one could avoid having to assume\neither separability or locality in order to conclude that the quantum\ndescription of the whole was incomplete with respect to its\nmacroscopic part. \n\nThis line of thought evolves and dominates over problems with\ncomposite systems and locality in his last published reflections on\nincompleteness. Instead he focuses on problems with the stability of\nmacro-descriptions in the transition to a classical level from the\nquantum. \n\nthe objective describability of individual macro-systems (description\nof the \u201creal-state\u201d) can not be renounced without the\nphysical picture of the world, so to speak, decomposing into a fog.\n(Einstein 1953b, p. 40. See also Einstein 1953a.)\n\n\nIn the August 8, 1935 letter to Schr\u00f6dinger Einstein says that he\nwill illustrate the problem by means of a \u201ccrude macroscopic\nexample\u201d.\n\nThe system is a substance in chemically unstable equilibrium, perhaps\na charge of gunpowder that, by means of intrinsic forces, can\nspontaneously combust, and where the average life span of the whole\nsetup is a year. In principle this can quite easily be represented\nquantum-mechanically. In the beginning the psi-function characterizes\na reasonably well-defined macroscopic state. But, according to your\nequation [i.e., the Schr\u00f6dinger equation], after the course of a\nyear this is no longer the case. Rather, the psi-function then\ndescribes a sort of blend of not-yet and already-exploded systems.\nThrough no art of interpretation can this psi-function be turned into\nan adequate description of a real state of affairs; in reality there\nis no intermediary between exploded and not-exploded. (Fine 1996, p.\n78)\n\n\nThe point is that after a year either the gunpowder will have\nexploded, or not. (This is the \u201creal state\u201d which in the\nEPR situation requires one to assume separability.) The state\nfunction, however, will have evolved into a complex superposition over\nthese two alternatives. Provided we maintain the eigenvalue-eigenstate\nlink, the quantum description by means of that state function will\nyield neither conclusion, and hence the quantum description is\nincomplete. For a contemporary response to this line of argument, one\nmight look to the program of decoherence. (See\n Decoherence.)\n That program points to interactions with the environment which may\nquickly reduce the likelihood of any interference between the\n\u201cexploded\u201d and the \u201cnot-exploded\u201d branches of\nthe evolved psi-function. Then, breaking the eigenvalue-eigenstate\nlink, decoherence adopts a perspective according to which the (almost)\nnon-interfering branches of the psi-function allow that the gunpowder\nis indeed either exploded or not. Even so, decoherence fails to\nidentify which alternative is actually realized, leaving the quantum\ndescription still incomplete. Such decoherence-based interpretations\nof the psi-function are certainly \u201cartful\u201d, and their\nadequacy is still under debate (see Schlosshauer 2007, especially\nChapter 8).\n\nThe reader may recognize the similarity between Einstein\u2019s\n exploding gunpowder example\n and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat (Schr\u00f6dinger 1935a, p. 812). In the\ncase of the cat an unstable atom is hooked up to a lethal device that,\nafter an hour, is as likely to poison (and kill) the cat as not,\ndepending on whether the atom decays. After an hour the cat is either\nalive or dead, but the quantum state of the whole atom-poison-cat\nsystem at this time is a superposition involving the two possibilities\nand, just as in the case of the gunpowder, is not a complete\ndescription of the situation (life or death) of the cat. The\nsimilarity between the gunpowder and the cat is hardly accidental\nsince Schr\u00f6dinger first produced the cat example in his reply of\nSeptember 19, 1935 to Einstein\u2019s August 8 gunpowder letter. There\nSchr\u00f6dinger says that he has himself constructed \u201can\nexample very similar to your exploding powder keg\u201d, and proceeds\nto outline the cat (Fine 1996, pp. 82\u201383). Although the\n\u201ccat paradox\u201d is usually cited in connection with the\nproblem of quantum measurement (see the relevant section of the entry\non\n Philosophical Issues in Quantum Theory)\n and treated as a paradox separate from EPR, its origin is here as an\nargument for incompleteness that avoids the twin assumptions of\nseparability and locality. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s development of\n\u201centanglement\u201d, the term he introduced for the\ncorrelations that result when quantum systems interact, also began in\nthis correspondence over EPR \u2014 along with a treatment of what he\ncalled quantum \u201csteering\u201d (Schr\u00f6dinger 1935a, 1935b;\nsee\n Quantum Entanglement and Information).\n",
