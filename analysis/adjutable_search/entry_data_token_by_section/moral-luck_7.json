    "main_text": "Responding to the Problem: Three Approaches || Incoherence\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe problem of moral luck is deeply unsettling. Naturally, there is a\nwide variety of responses to it. On the one extreme are those who deny\nthat there is any sort of moral luck, and on the other are those who\naccept every sort of moral luck. Most writers who have responded to\nthe problem fall somewhere in between; either they explicitly take a\nmixed approach or they confine their arguments to a carefully\ndelineated subset of types of moral luck while remaining uncommitted\nwith respect to the others. The extreme positions are vulnerable to\nthe objection that they have left some consideration or other\ncompletely unaccounted for. But those who occupy the middle also face\na formidable challenge: where can one draw a principled line between\nacceptable and unacceptable forms of luck? As we have seen, one\napparently natural place to draw a line is between resultant luck and\nall of the other sorts. On this view, there is no resultant moral\nluck, despite initial appearances, although there is moral luck of all\nthe other kinds. Thus, occupiers of this position face the challenge\nof setting out a plausible rationale for drawing the line where they\ndo. But they also face the challenge of where precisely to draw\nanother line, namely, the line around what counts as\n\u201cresults.\u201d For we can ask on which side of this line do\nintentions, willings, bodily movements, and so on, fall. Do results\ninclude everything that happens after the formation of an intention or\nthe exertion of the will, for example? Or everything that follows the\nbeginning of the formation of an intention or the\nbeginning of the exertion of the will? Or everything that\nfollows the \u201caffection of the heart\u201d of which Adam Smith\nwrote so eloquently? These are difficult questions for those who would\ndraw a line at resultant luck. But difficult questions await every\nother proposal, too. Fortunately, there is a rich and growing\nliterature providing a full spectrum of responses to explore.\n",
