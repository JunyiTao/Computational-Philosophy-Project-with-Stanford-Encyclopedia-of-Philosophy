    "main_text": "Metaphysics || On Generation and Passing Away\n3.8 On Generation and Passing Away\n\nAs is standard within the intellectual milieu dominated by\nAristotelian physics, Israeli opined that the generation and passing\naway of terrestrial objects was the result of recombination of\nelements and their attendant properties (heat, coldness, wetness and\ndryness), a process which is governed by the movement of the cosmic\nsphere. Later thinkers would, via astrology, attribute certain roles\nin this process to the \u201cintelligences\u201d governing\nindividual celestial objects and their relative positions. The\nheavens, which are not composed of the four elements and hence not\naffected by their contrary qualities, are not subject to generation\nand degeneration.
