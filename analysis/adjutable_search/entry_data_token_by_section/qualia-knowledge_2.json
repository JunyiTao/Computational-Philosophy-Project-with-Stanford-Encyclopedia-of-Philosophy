    "main_text": "Some Clarifications || Two Versions of the Argument\n3.1 Two Versions of the Argument\n\nAs Horgan (1984) points out, talk of \u2018physical\ninformation\u2019 in the context of the knowledge argument is\nambiguous between an epistemological and an ontological reading.\n\u201cPhysical information\u201d may be interpreted (a) in the sense\nof what Horgan calls \u2018explicit physical information\u2019\n(according to Horgan\u2019s proposal a sentence S expresses\nexplicit physical information about certain processes just in case\nS belongs to, or follows from, a theoretically adequate\nphysical account of those processes) or (b) in the sense of\n\u2018ontologically physical information\u2019 which is explicated\nin Horgan (1984, 150) as follows: a sentence S\n\u201cexpresses ontologically physical information about certain\nprocesses just in case (i) all entities referred to or quantified over\nin S are physical entities, and (ii) all the properties and\nrelations expressed by the predicates in S are physical\nproperties and relations.\u201d Presupposing a distinction along\nthese lines one may replace \u2018to have all explicit physical\ninformation about x\u2019 by \u2018to have complete\nphysical knowledge about x\u2019 and one may replace\n\u2018to have all ontologically physical information about\nx\u2019 by \u2018to know all the physical facts about\nx\u2019. The argument may thus be reformulated in two\ndifferent ways:\n\n(V1) The weaker version of the knowledge argument:\n\n\n(1a) Mary has complete physical knowledge concerning facts\nabout human color vision before her release.\n\n(2a) But there is some kind of knowledge concerning facts\nabout human color vision that she does not have before her\nrelease.\n\nTherefore\n\n(3a) There is some kind of knowledge concerning facts about\nhuman color vision that is non-physical knowledge.\n\n(V2) The stronger version of the knowledge argument:\n\n\n\n(1b) Mary knows all the physical facts concerning human color\nvision before her release.\n\n(2b) But there are some facts about human color vision that\nMary does not know before her release.\n\nTherefore\n\n(3b) There are non-physical facts concerning human color\nvision.\n\n\nThe conclusion of the stronger version of the argument (3b) is an\nontological claim that the physicalist must reject. The\nconclusion of the weaker version of the argument is merely an\nepistemological claim that is compatible with denying the existence of\nnon-physical facts. Although Jackson\u2019s original formulation in terms\nof information is open to both interpretations it is clear that the\nsecond stronger version is what he had in mind.\n\nAs many have pointed out, the result of the weaker version (3a) does\nnot imply the result of the stronger version (3b). That a person has\nincomplete knowledge about a certain topic does not imply without\nfurther assumptions that there is some specific fact she does not have\nknowledge of. The example of knowledge about oneself (de se\nknowledge) may illustrate the general point. Let us suppose that John,\nwho is at t in Amsterdam, does not know that he is now in\nAmsterdam (if asked about his present location he would assert\n\u201cI am now in Venice\u201d). John\u2019s knowledge concerning the\npresent location of people is incomplete. He lacks a specific locating\npiece of de se knowledge. Still, there need not be any fact\nconcerning the location of people that John does not have knowledge\nof. It does not follow from the description of the case that John does\nnot have knowledge of the fact that John is in Amsterdam. John may\nwell know that John is in Amsterdam but, having forgotten that he is\nhimself John, he may fail to conclude that he is now in Amsterdam. If\nJohn finally learns that he is in Amsterdam, he does not thereby learn\na new fact \u2013 or so many philosophers would insist \u2013 he gains\nnew knowledge of a fact that he already knew in a different way.\n\nIf \u2013 in analogy to the de se case \u2013 some physical\nfacts about color vision can be known in two different ways, \u2013 in\na \u2018physical way\u2019 (under \u2018physical concepts\u2019)\nand in some other, non-physical way (under \u2018non-physical\nconcepts\u2019), then it is possible to acquire new (non-physical)\nknowledge about a (physical) fact without thereby acquiring knowledge\nof a new fact (the very same fact may have been known before under its\nphysical conceptualization). Many authors accept the weaker version of\nthe argument but reject the stronger one for the reason just sketched:\nthey admit that Mary gains new propositional knowledge but deny that\nshe thereby comes to know facts that she did not know before in some\nother way. (These authors accept the first premise of both versions of\nthe argument and the second premise of the first version as well, but\nthey deny the second premise of the second version and insist that\n(2a) does not imply (2b)). Their position with respect to the\nknowledge argument will be called the New Knowledge/Old\nFact-View (see\n Section 4.6\n below). Others deny even the weaker version V1 and claim that Mary\ndoes not gain any new propositional knowledge (no new knowledge about\nsomething that is the case, no factual knowledge). Their position will\nbe called the No Propositional Knowledge View (see\n Sections 4.3\n and\n 4.5\n below).\n\nTo locate the different points of disagreement it is helpful to\nformulate the stronger version of the argument more explicitly.\n\n(V3) Explicit formulation of the knowledge argument (stronger\nversion) :\n\n\nPremise P1\nMary has complete physical knowledge about human\ncolor vision before her release.\n\n\nTherefore  \n\nConsequence\u00a0C1\nMary knows all the physical facts about human color\nvision before her release. \n\nPremise P2 \nThere is some (kind of) knowledge concerning facts\nabout human color vision that Mary does not have before her release.\n\n\nTherefore (from (P2)):  \n\nConsequence\u00a0C2\nThere are some facts about human color vision that\nMary does not know before her release.\n\n\nTherefore (from (C1) and (C2)):  \n\nConsequence\u00a0C3\nThere are non-physical facts about human color\nvision. \n\n\n\nOnce C1 and C2 are accepted, there is obviously no way to avoid C3\n(which follows logically from the former two). Moreover, is seems hard\nto deny that it is in principle possible to have complete\nphysical knowledge about human color vision (or about an appropriately\nchosen part thereof). If so, premise P1 should be accepted as an\nappropriate description of a legitimate thought experiment. To avoid\nthe antimaterialist conclusion C3 the physicalist can (a) object\nagainst the inference from P1 to C1 (a minority of philosophers have\nchosen this strategy, see\n Section 4.2\n below) or he or she can avoid C2 by (b) denying premise P2 (this is\nthe strategy chosen by proponents of the No Propositional\nKnowledge View, see Sections\n 4.3\n and\n 4.5\n below) or by (c) blocking the inference from premise P2 to C2 (this\nis the strategy chosen by a majority of physicalist philosophers who\nsubscribe to some version of the New Knowledge/Old Fact View,\nsee\n Section 4.6\n below).\n",
