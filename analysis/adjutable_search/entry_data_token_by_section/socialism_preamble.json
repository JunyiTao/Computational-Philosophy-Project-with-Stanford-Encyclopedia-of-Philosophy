    "main_text": "\n\nSocialism is a rich tradition of political thought and practice, the\nhistory of which contains a vast number of views and theories, often\ndiffering in many of their conceptual, empirical, and normative\ncommitments. In his 1924 Dictionary of Socialism, Angelo\nRappoport canvassed no fewer than forty definitions of socialism,\ntelling his readers in the book\u2019s preface that \u201cthere are\nmany mansions in the House of Socialism\u201d (Rappoport 1924: v,\n34\u201341). To take even a relatively restricted subset of socialist\nthought, Leszek Ko\u0142akowski could fill over 1,300 pages in his\nmagisterial survey of Main Currents of Marxism\n(Ko\u0142akowski 1978 [2008]). Our aim is of necessity more modest. In\nwhat follows, we are concerned to present the main features of\nsocialism, both as a critique of capitalism, and as a proposal for its\nreplacement. Our focus is predominantly on literature written within a\nphilosophical idiom, focusing in particular on philosophical writing\non socialism produced during the past forty-or-so years. Furthermore,\nour discussion concentrates on the normative contrast between\nsocialism and capitalism as economic systems. Both socialism and\ncapitalism grant workers legal control of their labor power, but\nsocialism, unlike capitalism, requires that the bulk of the means of\nproduction workers use to yield goods and services be under the\neffective control of workers themselves, rather than in the hands of\nthe members of a different, capitalist class under whose direction\nthey must toil. As we will explain below, this contrast has been\narticulated further in different ways, and socialists have not only\nmade distinctive claims regarding economic organization but also\nregarding the processes of transformation fulfilling them and the\nprinciples and ideals orienting their justification (including, as we\nwill see, certain understandings of freedom, equality, solidarity, and\n democracy).[1]\n",
