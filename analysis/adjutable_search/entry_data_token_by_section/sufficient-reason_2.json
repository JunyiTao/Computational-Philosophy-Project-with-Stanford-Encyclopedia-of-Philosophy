    "main_text": "Leibniz\n3. Leibniz\n\nNo philosopher is more closely associated with the PSR than Gottfried\nWilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716). He was the first to call it by name\nand to recognize it as a major principle of philosophy. Still, Leibniz\nwas well aware of the similarity between his principle and\nSpinoza\u2019s claims. Thus, in a 1676 marginal note to his copy of\nSpinoza\u2019s \u201cLetter on the Infinite\u201d (which we have\njust discussed at the end of \u00a72), he writes: \u201cThis is\nrightly observed, and agrees with what I am accustomed to saying that\nnothing exists but that for whose existence a sufficient reason can be\nprovided\u201d (Leibniz, Labyrinth of the Continuum, 117/\nAiii71). Leibniz\u2019s treatment of the PSR is also noteworthy for\nits systematicity and the centrality that he accords it.\n\nLeibniz often presents it, along with the Principle of Contradiction,\nas a principle of \u201creasoning\u201d. For example, in the\nMonadology (1714) he writes:\n\n\n31. Our reasonings are based on two great principles, that of\ncontradiction, in virtue of which we judge that which involves a\ncontradiction to be false, and that which is opposed or contradictory\nto the false to be true.\n\n32. And that of sufficient reason, by virtue of which we consider that\nwe can find no true or existent fact [fait], no true\nassertion [\u00e9nonciation v\u00e9ritable], without\nthere being a sufficient reason why it is thus and not otherwise,\nalthough most of the time these reasons cannot be known to us. (G VI,\n612/L 646)\n\n\nThese principles are characterized in what appears to be epistemic\nterms. They are principles of \u201cour reasoning\u201d. They\nconcern what we \u201cjudge\u201d or \u201cfind\u201d. And yet it\nis clear that Leibniz intends them to have metaphysical as well as\nepistemic import. In the case of the PSR, this will become more\nevident when we discuss how Leibniz understands the notion of a\nsufficient reason but it is already indicated in the passage quoted\nabove by the fact that Leibniz explicitly states that there are\nsufficient reasons for every truth or fact even if such reasons are\nunknowable by us. (The distinction between the epistemic and\nthe metaphysical collapses with respect to God because there can\nbe no gap between what an omniscient being knows and how things\nare.) \n\nThe scope of the PSR, as stated above, includes facts and truths.\nLeibniz sometimes, however, characterizes the scope of the principle\nin different terms. For example, he writes:\n\n\n[T]he principle of sufficient reason, namely, that nothing\nhappens [rien n\u2019arrive] without a reason. (G\nVII 356; LC L2; AG 321, our emphasis)\n\n\nThe PSR is here said to apply to what \u201chappens\u201d. This\nsuggests a version of the PSR that applies not to truths or facts but\nrather events: Every event has a sufficient reason.\n\nThese vacillations in the formulation of the PSR are not typically\ntaken to register indecision on Leibniz\u2019s part as to the scope\nof the PSR. Rather they are usually understood as indicating that\nLeibniz views the scope of the PSR to be very wide, perhaps even\nabsolutely general, but at least wide enough to encompass facts,\ntruths, and events (see Rodriguez-Pererya 2018).\n\nLeibniz associates the Principle of Contradiction and the PSR with a\nvariety of domains where each is especially important. For example,\nthere are domains where the truths of the domain depend on\none of the two principles. These domains are characterized modally:\nThe Principle of Contradiction rules over the domain of necessary\ntruths and the PSR rules over the domain of contingent truths (A 6 4\n1616/MP 75; G VII 355\u201356/LC 15\u201316).\n\nThere are also domains that are characterized in terms of subject\nmatter or areas of inquiry. The Principle of Contradiction allows us\nto study mathematics, whereas the PSR allows us to study metaphysics,\nnatural theology, and physics (G VII, 355\u20136; LC L2; AG 321). It\nis far from obvious that these two ways of assigning domains to the\nPrinciples are equivalent. For example, it would be natural to assume\nthat metaphysics and natural theology would include necessary\npropositions and thus the PSR would encroach upon the territory\nassigned to the Principle of Contradiction according to the modal\ncharacterization.\n\nWe must therefore distinguish distinct ways of associating the\nprinciples with various domains. The first way is to specify the\ndomain to which each principle applies. Leibniz appears to\nbelieve that, according to this approach, there is a single universal\ndomain and it is associated equally with each principle. There are no\ncontradictory contingent facts or truths and so the Principle of\nNoncontradiction applies to all contingent truths as well as\nall necessary truths. Likewise, it is usually assumed that, for\nLeibniz, every necessary truth has a sufficient reason (see Broad\n1975: 12 and 34 and Rodriguez-Pererya 2018). For example, mathematical\ntruths, might have sufficient reasons in the form of proofs that rest\non statements of identity. Thus the PSR applies to all\nnecessary truths as well as all contingent truths.\n\nThe second way of associating the principles with specific domains is\nto specify the domain of truths that is grounded on or\ndepends on each principle. According to Leibniz, only\ncontingent truths depend on and are grounded by the PSR. Likewise,\nLeibniz believes that only necessary truths depend on and are grounded\nby the Principle of Contradiction. What does it mean for some truths\nto depend on a principle? Leibniz is not explicit on this\npoint but we will get a better idea in the next section when we\nconsider the question of what counts as a sufficient reason.\n\nThe third way is to specify a domain of truths that can be\ninvestigated on the basis of each principle. For Leibniz, we\ncan know mathematical truths only on the basis of the Principle of\nContradiction and only metaphysical, theological, and physical truths\nrequire the PSR in order to be known. We will see in more detail in\nwhat way the PSR allows us to investigate these domains in the section\non applications.\n",
