    "main_text": "Argument from a Weak Principle of Sufficient Reason\n6. Argument from a Weak Principle of Sufficient Reason\n\nRichard Gale and Alexander Pruss (1999) advanced a modal version of\nthe cosmological argument. They reject the strong version of the PSR,\naccording to which \u201cfor every proposition \\(p\\), if \\(p\\) is\ntrue, then there is a proposition, \\(q\\), that explains \\(p\\)\u201d.\nIn its place they favor using a weak version of the PSR\u2014it is\npossible that for every true proposition, there is a proposition,\n\\(q\\), that explains \\(p\\)\u2014that they believe is less\nquestion-begging and more initially acceptable to critics. They phrase\nthe argument in terms of contingent and necessary propositions. A\ncontingent proposition is one that is both possibly true and possibly\nfalse (i.e., true in some worlds and false in others); a necessarily\ntrue proposition is true in every possible world. In its simplest\nform, the argument is (1) if it is possible that it is necessary that\na supernatural being of some sort exists, then it is necessary that a\nsupernatural being of that sort exists. Since (2) it is possible that\nit is necessary that a supernatural being of some sort exists, (3) it\nis necessary that this being exists. The being that Gale has in mind\nis a very powerful and intelligent designer-creator, not the perfect\nGod of Anselm, for this perfect God who would exist in all possible\nworlds would be incompatible with the existence of gratuitous and\nhorrendous evils to be found in some of those possible worlds.\n\nIf one grants modal Axiom S5 (if it is possible that it is necessary\nthat \\(p\\), then it is necessary that \\(p\\)), the critical premise in\nthe argument is the second, and Gale and Pruss proceed to defend it\nusing their weak PSR. They begin with the notion of a Big Conjunctive\nFact (BCF), which is the totality of propositions that would be true\nof any possible world were it actualized. Since all possible worlds\nwould have the same necessary propositions, they are differentiated by\ntheir Big Conjunctive Contingent Fact (BCCF), which would contain\ndifferent contingent propositions. Let \\(p\\) be the BCCF of the actual\nworld \\(W\\). Suppose, further, that it is possible that \\(p\\) has an\nexplanation, that is, that it is possible that some proposition \\(q\\)\nexplains \\(p\\). As such, there is a possible world \\(W_{1}\\) that\ncontains \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and the proposition that \\(q\\) explains \\(p\\).\nThe question now is whether \\(W_{1}\\) is the actual world, that is,\nwhether there is a proposition \\(q\\) that explains \\(p\\) in the actual\nworld. Gale argues that \\(W_{1}\\) (which contains \\(q\\) and the\nproposition that \\(q\\) explains \\(p\\)) is the actual world, for since\n\\(W_{1}\\) contains \\(p\\), there can be no property of \\(p\\) that is\nnot found in \\(W_{1}\\). Every conjunct of \\(p\\) will be a conjunct of\n\\(p_{1}\\) (the BCCF of \\(W_{1}\\)) in \\(W_{1}\\). Suppose that \\(r\\) is\na conjunct of \\(p\\) in \\(W\\), then not-\\(r\\) cannot be a conjunct of\n\\(p_{1}\\) in \\(W_{1}\\). Since \\(W\\) and \\(W_{1}\\) have the same\nproperties, \\(W_{1}\\) is the actual world. Therefore, since these\nworlds are identical, the actual world contains \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and the\nproposition that \\(q\\) explains \\(p\\). That is, there is something\nthat explains the BCCF of the actual world. The explanation of the\nBCCF cannot be scientific, for such would be in terms of law-like\npropositions and statements about the actual world at a given time,\nwhich would be contingent and hence part of the BCCF. Since the only\nexplanations we can conceive of are personal or scientific, \\(q\\)\nprovides a personal explanation of the BCCF in terms of the\nintentional action of a necessary being who freely brings it about\nthat the world exists. \\(q\\) cannot report the action of a contingent\nbeing, for then the being would be part of \\(p\\) and explained by\n\\(q\\). However, something cannot explain itself. Hence, although\ncontingent, \\(q\\) reports the action of a necessary being. Gale\nconcludes that although this necessary being exists in every possible\nworld, this tells little about its power, goodness, and other\nqualities. To make this being palatable to theists, he offers that the\nargument be supplemented by other arguments, such as the teleological\narguments, to suggest that the necessary being is the kind of being\nthat satisfies theistic requirements. Since \n\n\nthe actual world\u2019s universe displays a wondrous complexity due\nto its law-like unity and simplicity, fine tuning of natural\nconstants, and natural purpose and beauty,\u2026there exists a\nnecessary supernatural being who is very powerful, intelligent, and\ngood and freely creates the actual world\u2019s universe. (1999:\n468\u201369) \n\n\n(For the detailed 18 step deductive argument, see Gale and Pruss 1999:\n462\u201369).\n\nSeveral objections have been raised about the argument from the weak\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Almeida and Judisch (2002) construct\ntheir objection via two reductio arguments. They note that, according\nto Gale\u2019s argument, \\(q\\) is a contingent proposition in the\nactual world that reports the free, intentional action of a necessary\nbeing. As such, since the actual world contains the contingent\nproposition \\(q\\), non-\\(q\\) is possible. That is, there is a possible\nworld \\(W_{2}\\) that contains \\(p\\), non-\\(q\\), and the proposition\nthat \\(q\\) does not explain \\(p\\). However, by Gale\u2019s own\nreasoning, \\(W_{2}\\) is identical to the actual world. But the actual\nworld cannot contain both \\(q\\) and non-\\(q\\). Thus, \\(q\\) cannot be a\ncontingent proposition.\n\nOn the other hand, assume that \\(q\\) is a contingently necessary\nproposition, that is, that it is possible that \\(q\\) is necessary and\npossible that \\(q\\) is not necessary. By S5, we get that it is\nnecessary that \\(q\\) is necessary, making it impossible that \\(q\\) is\nnot necessary. As a result, it is both possible and not-possible that\n\\(q\\) is not necessary, which likewise shows that \\(q\\) cannot be a\ncontingently necessary proposition. The only other option is that\n\\(q\\) is a necessary truth, which would beg the question. Thus, the\nargument fails by being unable to characterize \\(q\\). For rebuttals,\nsee Gale and Pruss (2002) and Rutten (2012: 84\u201387, see Other\nInternet Resources).\n\nGraham Oppy (2000) similarly argues that suppose \\(p_1\\) is the BCF of\nsome possible world, and \\(p_1\\) has no explanation. Then, given \\(r\\)\n(namely, that \\(p_1\\) has no explanation) there is a conjunctive fact\n\\(p_1\\) and \\(r\\). Since by hypothesis the conjunctive fact \\(p_1\\)\nand \\(r\\) is true in some world, on Gale\u2019s account it is true in\nthe actual world. Then by the weak PSR there is a world in which this\nconjunction of \\(p_1\\) and \\(r\\) possibly has an explanation. If there\nis an explanation for the conjunction of \\(p_1\\) and \\(r\\), there is\nan explanation for \\(p_1\\). Thus, we have the contradiction that\n\\(p_1\\) both has and does not have an explanation, which is absurd.\nHence, no world exists where the BCF lacks an explanation, which is\nthe strong principle of sufficient reason that Gale allegedly\ncircumvented. Since accepting the weak PSR would commit the nontheist\nto the strong PSR and ultimately to a necessary being, the nontheist\nhas no motivation to accept the weak PSR.\n\nGale and Pruss (2002) subsequently concede that their weak PSR does\nentail the strong PSR, but they contend that there still is no reason\nnot to proceed with the weak PSR, which they think the nontheist would\naccept. The only grounds for rejecting it, they claim, is that it\nleads to a theistic conclusion, which is not an independent reason for\nrejecting it. Oppy, however, maintains that appealing to some initial\ninstincts of acceptance is irrelevant. Perhaps the nontheists did not\nsee what granting the weak PSR entailed, that it contradicted other\nthings they had independent reasons to believe, or they did not fully\nunderstand the principle. There is a modus tollens reason to\nreject it, since there are other grounds for thinking that theism is\nfalse.\n\nJerome Gellman has argued that the Gale/Pruss conclusion to a being\nthat is not necessarily omnipotent also fails; this being is\nessentially omnipotent and, if omnipotence entails omniscience, is\nessentially omniscient. This too Gale and Pruss concede, which means\nthat the necessary being they conclude to is not significantly\ndifferent from that arrived at by the traditional cosmological\nargument that appeals to the moderate version of the PSR (that\ncontingent beings need a sufficient reason or explanation for\ntheir existence). \n",
