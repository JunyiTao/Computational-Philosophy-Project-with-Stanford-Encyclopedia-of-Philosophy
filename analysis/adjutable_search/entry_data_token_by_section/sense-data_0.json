    "main_text": "The Classical Notion of Sense Data: Term and Concept\n1. The Classical Notion of Sense Data: Term and Concept\n\nConsider your present visual experience. Suppose that you are seated\nat a table in a garden. You are looking at objects on the table and at\nthe vivid colors of flowers in nearby beds. Now focus on a particular\nstatic instance of your looking: the moment in which you see a white\ncoaster on a brown garden table with a cut daisy lying just beyond the\ncoaster. The sense data for this scene would be the particular shapes\nand colors as immediately experienced, e.g., a white patch as seen out\nin front of you. You are looking at the coaster from an angle of about\nforty-five degrees. At this angle, many observers report the momentary\nvisual experience of an elliptical white shape. (Try to experience\nthis for yourself by observing a round coaster on a table at the\nsuggested angle. As we will discover, not everyone agrees that the\npatch looks elliptical: some find a circle at a slant.) The table top\nis small enough that you can take it in at one glance: at this angle,\nmany describe their momentary visual experience as containing a\ntrapezoidal brown expanse, with the larger base of the trapezoid\ntoward them. The daisy presents sense data of a specific yellow and\nround shape, white petal-shapes, and green leaf- and stem-shapes.\n\nThese descriptions of sense data focus on the basic visual properties\ncolor and shape: the facts that we are seeing a table, a coaster, and\na daisy are not, in the usual sense-data theories, part of what is\ngiven. Typically, the sense data are just patches with a shape and a\ncolor; thus, if the daisy were partly obscured by a mug that had been\nplaced on the coaster, there would be two green shapes among the sense\ndata, on either side of the mug-shape, with no notion that the one\nbelonged with the other. Viewers typically are, of course, aware that\nspecific objects are present. In that case, the theory says that they\nhave gone beyond their sense data to perceive objects or things of\nvarious kinds (table, coaster, flower), as opposed to the bare shape\nand color of each sense datum.\n\nThe technical term \u201csense data\u201d was made prominent in\nphilosophy during the early decades of the twentieth century by G. E.\nMoore and Bertrand Russell, followed by intense elaboration and\nmodification of the concept by C. D.\n Broad,[1]\n H. H. Price, and A. J. Ayer, among others. Although the promoters of\nsense data disagreed in various ways, they mainly agreed on the\nfollowing points:\n\nIn perceiving, we are directly and immediately aware of a\nsense datum.\nThis awareness occurs by a relation of direct mental\nacquaintance with a datum.\nSense data have the properties that they appear to\nhave.\nThese properties are determinate; in vision, we\nexperience determinate shapes, sizes, and colors.\nOur awareness of such properties of sense data does not\ninvolve the affirmation or conception of any object beyond the\ndatum.\nThese properties are known to us with certainty (and\nperhaps infallibly).\nSense data are private; a datum is apprehended by only\none person.\nSense data are distinct from the act of sensing, or the\nact by which we are aware of them.\n\n\nThis list constitutes a basic analysis of the Classical Notion of\nsense data.\n Item (1)\n says that sense data are not perceived by the mediation of anything\nelse. This was often put by saying that sense data are the immediate\nobjects of acts of sensing.\n Item (2)\n states that our mental relation to sense data is one of direct\nacquaintance.\n (3)\n says that if we immediately sense a brown patch of a certain shape,\nwe are acquainted with an item that has the phenomenal brownness and\nthe shape as present in our experience. That is, however color may be\nconsidered in physical science (as a microphysical property of object\nsurfaces, for instance), the sense datum possesses the phenomenally\npresent color property.\n (4)\n indicates that such properties are experienced as determinate; for\nexample, we experience a specific shade of brown.\n Item (5)\n distinguishes the awareness of sensory qualities such as color and\nshape from the judgment or affirmation that a material object (or\nother entity) might underlie the sense datum.\n (6)\n claims that each perceiver is certain about, and, in a stronger\nversion, cannot err about, there being an instance of brown color of a\ncertain shape that is experienced.\n (7)\n holds that sense data are private, or perhaps that they inhabit a\nprivate space, so that sense data can be related to one another for\none perceiver, but the sense data of one perceiver are not in an\nimmediate relation to the sense data of another.\n (8)\n says that sense data are distinct from the mental acts by which we\nperceive them; in the Classical Notion, this typically included that\nthey are not mind-dependent but are independent items.\n\nIt may be helpful to mention several things that are not included in\nthe above. Sense data are described as immediate objects of awareness,\nbut there is no statement that we therefore only immediately perceive\nsense data and do not immediately perceive external objects, a\nconclusion which many theorists accepted. Further, there is no\nspecification of whether sense data are two dimensional or contain\ndepth. Early theorists are typically read as asserting two-dimensional\n data;[2]\n the second wave, including Price (1932: 3, 218\u2013220), explicitly\ngave some of them depth. There is no statement about whether sense\ndata persist beyond the momentary sensing of them, as there was\ndisagreement on this point. There is no assertion of their origin,\ncausal or otherwise. It is natural to think of sense data as caused by\nobjects and as being related to those objects as appearance to\nreality, a position expressed by some authors (e.g., Russell 1912: ch.\n1; Broad 1923: 237\u2013240). But that conception is not included\nhere in the agreed-upon attributes of sense data in their early\nhistory. Similarly,\n item 5\n distinguishes the apprehension of a sense datum from that of a\nmaterial object or other entity; it takes no stand on whether such\nobjects are inferred from sense data, are affirmed by a cognitive act\nthat is not an inference, or are treated in some other way. Nor does\nitem 5 say whether sense data represent objects or their properties,\nindependently of a further act of judgment or affirmation; some\nclassical theorists denied that sense data are intrinscially\nrepresentational. Further, sense data were not tied to specific\nneurophysiological processes, even if it was admitted by some authors\nthat they are conditioned by neurophysiological states (such as those\nthat produce afterimages). Finally, na\u00efve realists sometimes\ndescribed the immediate apprehension of a portion of the surface of an\nobject as a perceptual datum. Present-day taxonomies of philosophies\nof perception typically contrast na\u00efve direct realism with\nsense-data theory, an outlook that results in part from the present\ntendency to treat sense data as mental (Crane & French 2015\n[2021]). But in the classical period, there were arguments to the\neffect that sense data are direct perceptions of a part of the surface\nof a material object (Moore 1918\u201319: 23\u201324), a position\nthat Price (1932: chs. 2\u20133) described and sought to\nundermine.\n\nIn the above statement of the Classical Notion, nothing explicit is\nsaid about the metaphysical classification of sense data. They might\nbe events, substances, states of substances; they might be either\nphysical or mental. As mentioned, the majority of authors involved in\nthe original discussion held that sense data are not mental. But some\ntheorists advised that the term \u201csense data\u201d in its basic\nmeaning should be treated as neutral on ontology (e.g., Moore\n1913\u201314; Price 1932: 18\u201320), even if further argument led\nto a view that they are not mental. For the neutralists, accepting\nthat sense data exist should be compatible with various theories of\nperceptual ontology, such as na\u00efve realism, representative\nrealism, Berkeleyan idealism, and Kantian transcendental idealism.\n\nEarly theorists who considered sense data to be mind-independent\ntypically thought of them as persisting through time. Russell, in\nearly sense-data writings (1912: ch. 1), viewed such data as existing\napart from the mind as a special kind of thing (neither mental nor\nphysical), which was commonly designated as a tertium quid or\n\u201cthird thing\u201d, in addition to objects (such as a physical\ntable) and the perceiver\u2019s mental states. Such intermediary\nthird things might be epistemically given only in the act of sensing\nthem, but they would not depend for their existence on that act. This\nled to the notion of unsensed sense data (e.g., mind-independent\npatches of color), which were sometimes called\n\u201csensibilia\u201d to indicate that they could be sensed if\nsomeone were at the right location, but that they existed in any case\n(Russell 1914b: sec. 3). In the second half of the twentieth century,\nwhen sense data came to be viewed mainly as mind-dependent, they were\nconsidered to be mental objects or contents of which we are directly\naware. Accordingly, the white shape of the coaster-shaped patch would\nbe a property of the mental object that is experienced, which was\ntaken to mean that the mental state itself would have among its\nproperties a white and roundish patch of color (Jackson 1977: chs.\n4\u20135).\n\nThe initial positing of sense data arose within an extant discussion\nof sense perception and its objects. In Oxford and Cambridge of the\nlate nineteenth century, it was common to discuss perception as part\nof the \u201cproblem of the external world\u201d, an epistemological\nproblem found in modern philosophy, from Descartes onward, concerning\nwhether we know an external world beyond our own minds and, if so, how\nwe know it. These discussions typically assumed a distinction between\nsensation and perception, similar in many ways to that later drawn\nbetween sense data and the perception of material objects. A standard\ndescription of how vision occurs would say that sensations of shape\nand color are first produced via the stimulation of the sensory\nnerves, and that from such sensations the perceiver forms perceptions\nof objects, perhaps through a process of judgment or through learned\nassociative connections among sensations. Let us turn, then, to the\nhistory of theories of sensation and perception, and the rise of sense\ndata.\n",
