He is well known as an\nadvocate of The Theory of Representational Realism, according to which\nour perceptions are indirect cognitive transactions with the\nworld: a perceptual experience of a worldly object is not an immediate\nawareness of the object itself, but mediated by an immediate awareness\nof a sensum. For example, when we see a coin from a certain\nangle we are immediately aware of an elliptical sensum.\n",
