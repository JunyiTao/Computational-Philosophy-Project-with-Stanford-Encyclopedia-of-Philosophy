    "main_text": "Outline of scientific debates over nativism || The rise of instinct psychology at the turn of the 20th century\n1.2 The rise of instinct psychology at the turn of the 20th century\n\nWallace\u2019s criticisms were overshadowed by Darwin\u2019s\npopularity and influence. The final decade of the 19th\ncentury saw growing scientific interest in the study of instincts,\nmuch of it in a Darwinian vein. This was also a period of intense\ndispute about the nature of instincts. A key point of disagreement\nconcerned the relationship between instinct and habit during\ndevelopment. William James outlined a list of roughly forty human\ninstincts in his Principles of Psychology, and famously\nproclaimed that humans possess more (not fewer) instincts compared to\nother animals. His list included such eyebrow-raising candidates as\n\u201ca native impulse in everyone to conceal love affairs\u201d, a\n\u201cgenuine instinct of cleanliness\u201d, and an \u201cinstinct\nof personal isolation, which in women is called coyness\u201d (1890,\n393). It is important to understand what James meant when classifying\nsuch behaviors as instinctive. For James, the influence of instinct on\nbehavior takes place during early stages of development. As he\nexplained in Principles of Psychology, \u201cMost instincts\nare implanted for the sake of giving rise to habits and\u2026 this\npurpose, once accomplished, the instincts themselves, as such, have no\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre in the psychical economy, and consequently\nfade away\u201d (1890, 398). Thus, to call a behavior\n\u201cinstinctive\u201d meant, for James, that it has a\ndevelopmental origin in some more basic behavior which itself required\nno prior experience. After first performance, however, the original\nbehavior is modified by reason, learning, and habit. This\ndevelopmental model stood in contrast to the more static view of\ninstinct defended by Romanes and others, wherein instincts often\nremain unmodified by experience into maturity.\n\nA second point of scientific disagreement concerned the evolutionary\norigin of instincts. The prevailing view, held by Romanes and others,\ninvolved the inheritance of acquired habits.\n\u201cLate-19th century psychologists and intellectuals in\ngeneral assumed that heredity and environment could not be separated\nfunctionally or treated as independent factors, because change induced\nby the environment would sooner or later (depending on the author)\nbecome a part of the organism\u2019s racial heritage\u201d (Cravens\nand Burnham 1971, 637\u201338). This model was fiercely criticized by\nAugust Weismann (1891 (1888)), who drew a sharp distinction between\ngerm plasm and soma. On Weismann\u2019s model, the germ plasm (i.e.\nhereditary material) is sequestered early in development placing it\nbeyond the influence of somatic modifications, including habits or\nother traits acquired over the life of an organism. In addition,\nWeismann maintained that selection acts only on traits that emanate\ndirectly from the germline (Johnston 1987). He allowed that some\ntraits are the product of environmental modifications during\ndevelopment. But these, Weismann held, could never become adaptations.\nThus, Weismann distinguished hereditary traits, which were under\ndirect control of the germline and could become adapted to the\nenvironment, from acquired traits, which were due to arbitrary\nenvironmental influences on the soma.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Weismann\u2019s views became popular at a time\nwhen many behavioral scientists rejected the distinction between\ninnate vs acquired characteristics. Not only James, but also Conwy\nLloyd Morgan (1896), Henry Fairfield Osborn (Kemp 1896) and James Mark\nBaldwin (1896) were developing models of behavioral evolution and\ndevelopment that emphasized an interaction between learned and\nhereditary factors (Boakes 1984). These authors followed Weismann in\naccepting that habits did not become incorporated into heredity as\ninstincts, but sought to explain how it could appear that\nacquired behavior became hereditary through mechanisms later, and\ndismissively, labelled \u2018Baldwin effects\u2019. According to\nhistorian Timothy Johnston, Weismann\u2019s popularity explains,\n\u201cwhy the dichotomy [between innate vs acquired traits] has been\nso influential and so long-lived in the twentieth century, despite\nrepeated and quite cogent arguments against it\u201d (1995, 115).\n\nWe have just considered two points of disagreement over the nature of\ninstinct that arose in the late 19th century as this concept was\ngaining in scientific currency. In fact, Morgan (1895) identified a\ntotal of seven \u201cdefinitional\u201d issues surrounding the\ninstinct concept in his day. It is noteworthy, given how fecund the\nconcept of instinct was in motivating scientific research between\n1880\u20131900, that instinct was already being criticised for its\nambiguity. Morgan expressed his frustration with this situation in the\nfollowing, frequently cited passage:\n\nInstinctive activities are unconscious (Claus), non-mental\n(Calderwood), incipiently conscious (Spencer), distinguished by the\npresence of consciousness (Romanes), accompanied by emotions in the\nmind (Wundt), involve connate ideas and inherited knowledge\n(Spalding); synonymous with impulsive activities (James), to be\ndistinguished from those involving impulse proper (Hoffding,\nMarshall); not yet voluntary (Spencer), no longer voluntary (Lewes),\nnever involuntary (Wundt); due to natural selection only (Weismann),\nto lapsed intelligence (Lewes, Schneider, Wundt), to both (Darwin,\nRomanes); to be distinguished from individually-acquired habits\n(Darwin, Romanes, Sully, and others), inclusive thereof (Wundt); at a\nminimum in man (Darwin, Romanes), at a maximum in man (James);\nessentially congenital (Romanes), inclusive of individually-acquired\nmodifications through intelligence (Darwin, Romanes, Wallace). (Lloyd\nMorgan 1895, quoted in Herrnstein 1972, 26)\n\n\nThe next two decades saw no decline in psychologists\u2019 interest\nin instincts. Between 1900 and 1920 over 600 articles and books were\npublished on this topic in the USA and England alone (Cravens 1978).\nMany of these publications emulated William James\u2019 work,\npresenting lists of candidate human and animal instincts. However,\nthese authors often departed from James\u2019 developmental account,\nviewing instincts instead as emerging fully formed and insensitive to\nexperience. Lists of candidate instincts also varied dramatically,\nwith some authors positing as few as two human instincts and others\nidentifying as many as 110 (L. L. Bernard 1921). William\nMcDougall\u2019s Introduction to Social Psychology (1908)\nwas an attempt to impose rigor to this branch of psychology. McDougall\nwas critical of his fellow instinct theorists, complaining that\n\u201c[h]undreds of passages might be quoted from contemporary\nauthors, even some of considerable philosophical culture, to\nillustrate how these two words [\u2018instinct\u2019 and\n\u2018instinctive\u2019] are used with a minimum of meaning,\ngenerally with the effect of disguising from the writer the obscurity\nand incoherence of his thought\u201d (1908, cited in Herrnstein\n1972). McDougall\u2019s solution was to define instincts more\nprecisely as motivational or \u2018hormic\u2019 internal states.\nSpecifically, he proposed that instincts are:\n\nan inherited or innate psycho-physical disposition which determines\nits possessor to perceive, and to pay attention to, objects of a\ncertain class, to experience an emotional excitement of a particular\nquality upon perceiving such an object, and to act in regard to it in\na particular manner, or, at least, to experience an impulse to such\naction. (1908, 25)\n\n\nMcDougall went on to posit various learning rules describing how both\nthe perceptual inputs and the behavioral outputs associated with an\ninstinct are modified by experience (Herrnstein 1972). Thus, much like\nJames, McDougall downplayed the distinction between instinctive vs\nacquired behavior, focusing instead on the developmental interaction\nbetween instincts (viewed as motivational states) and other factors\nsuch as perception and action. Dewsbury (1993) further notes that, for\nMcDougall, instincts were psychological processes that interacted with\nperceptions, emotions, and behavioral impulses.\n\nMcDougall\u2019s effort to reform the scientific concept of instinct\nwas perhaps too little too late, as his work primarily served as\nfodder for a group of anti-hereditarian psychologists who emerged in\nthe early 1920s. Three of the most outspoken critics of instinct were\nKnight Dunlap, Luther Lee Bernard, and Zing-Yang Kuo (Gu\u014d\nR\u00e8nyu\u01cen). Their arguments are worth considering,\nespecially since many of the same objections would be revived two\ndecades later in opposition to the ethological concept of\ninnateness.\n",
