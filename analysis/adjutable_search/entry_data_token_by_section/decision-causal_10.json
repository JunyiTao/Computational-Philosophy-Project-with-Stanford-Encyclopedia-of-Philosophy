    "main_text": "Current Issues || Outcomes\n3.3 Outcomes\n\nOne issue concerning outcomes is their comprehensiveness. Are an\nact\u2019s outcomes possible worlds, temporal aftermaths, or causal\nconsequences? Gibbard and Harper ([1978] 1981: 166\u2013168) mention\nthe possibility of narrowing outcomes to causal consequences, as\npractical applicability advocates. The narrowing must be judicious,\nhowever, because the expected-utility principle requires that outcomes\ninclude every relevant consideration. For example, if an agent is\naverse to risk, then each of a risky act\u2019s possible outcomes\nmust include the risk the act generates. Its inclusion tends to lower\neach possible outcome\u2019s utility.\nIn Sobel\u2019s canonical formula for expected utility,\n\n\\[\n\\textit{EU} (A) = \\sum_i P(A \\gt W_i)\\util (W_i).\n\\] \n\n\nThe formula, from one perspective, omits states of the world because\nthe outcomes themselves form a partition. The distinction between\nstates and outcomes dissolves because worlds play the role of both\nstates and outcomes. States are dispensable means of generating\noutcomes that are exclusive and exhaustive. According to a basic\nprinciple, an act\u2019s expected utility is a probability-weighted\naverage of possible outcomes that are exclusive and exhaustive, such\nas the worlds to which the act may lead.\nSuppose that a world\u2019s utility comes from realization of\nbasic intrinsic desires and aversions. Granting that the utilities of\ntheir realizations are additive, the utility of a world is a sum of\nthe utilities of their realizations. Then besides being a\nprobability-weighted average of the utilities of worlds to which it\nmay lead, an option\u2019s expected utility is also a\nprobability-weighted average of the realizations of basic intrinsic\ndesires and aversions. In this formula for its expected utility,\nstates play no explicit role:\n\n\\[\n\\textit{EU} (A) = \\sum_i P(A \\gt B_i)\\util (B_i),\n\\] \n\n\nwhere \\(B_i\\) ranges over possible realizations of basic intrinsic\ndesires and aversions. The formula considers for each basic desire and\naversion the prospect of its realization if the act were performed. It\ntakes the act\u2019s expected utility as the sum of the\nprospects\u2019 utilities. The formula provides an economical\nrepresentation of an act\u2019s expected utility. It eliminates\nstates and obtains expected utility directly from outcomes taken as\nrealizations of basic desires and aversions.\n\nTo illustrate calculation of an act\u2019s expected utility using\nbasic intrinsic desires and aversions, suppose that an agent has no\nbasic intrinsic aversions and just two basic intrinsic desires, one\nfor health and the other for wisdom. The utility of health is 4, and\nthe utility of wisdom is 8. In the formula for expected utility, a\nworld covers only matters about which the agent cares. In the example,\na world is a proposition specifying whether the agent has health and\nwhether he has wisdom. Accordingly, there are four worlds:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH  \\amp W, \\\\\nH   \\amp {\\sim}W, \\\\\n{\\sim}H   \\amp  W, \\\\\n{\\sim}H   \\amp {\\sim}W.\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] \n\n Suppose that \\(A\\) is equally likely to generate any\nworld. Using worlds, \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\textit{EU} (A) & = P(A \\gt(H \\amp W))\\util (H \\amp W) \\\\\n&\\qquad + P(A \\gt(H \\amp{\\sim}W))\\util (H \\amp{\\sim}W) \\\\\n&\\qquad + P(A \\gt({\\sim}H \\amp W))\\util ({\\sim}H \\amp W) \\\\\n&\\qquad + P(A \\gt({\\sim}H \\amp{\\sim}W))\\util ({\\sim}H \\amp{\\sim}W) \\\\\n& = (0.25)(12) + (0.25)(4) + (0.25)(8) + (0.25)(0) \\\\\n& = 6.\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\n\\] \n\n Using basic intrinsic attitudes,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\textit{EU} (A) &= P(A \\gt H)\\util (H) + P(A \\gt W)\\util (W) \\\\\n& = (0.5)(4) + (0.5)(8) \\\\\n& = 6.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n The two methods of computing an option\u2019s utility\nare equivalent given that, under supposition of an act\u2019s\nrealization, the probability of a basic intrinsic desire\u2019s or\naversion\u2019s realization is the sum of the probabilities of the\nworlds that realize it.\n",
