What is faith? What makes faith reasonable or unreasonable,\nvaluable or disvaluable, morally permissible or impermissible,\nvirtuous or vicious? How does faith relate to psychological states\nsuch as belief, desire, trust, and hope? How does faith relate to\naction? To what extent is faith under our voluntary control? Because\nanswers to these further questions depend on what faith is, as well as\non assumptions about relevant evaluative norms and the philosophical\npsychology and theory of action applicable to faith, this entry\nfocusses on the nature of faith, while also touching upon\nimplications of various models of faith for assessments of its\nreasonableness and value.\n\n\u2018Faith\u2019 is a broad term, appearing in locutions that point\nto a range of different phenomena. We speak of \u2018having faith\nthat you will succeed, despite setbacks,\u2019 \u2018having faith in\ndemocracy,\u2019 \u2018putting faith in God,\u2019 \u2018believing\nthat God exists by faith,\u2019 \u2018being a person of\nfaith,\u2019 \u2018professing and keeping the faith (or losing\nit),\u2019 \u2018keeping (or failing to keep) faith with\nsomeone\u2019, and so on. At its most general \u2018faith\u2019\nmeans much the same as \u2018trust\u2019. Uses of\n\u2018faith\u2019 and \u2018faithfulness\u2019 closely parallel\n\u2018trust\u2019 and \u2018trustworthiness\u2019 and these are\noften used interchangeably. Yet one of the striking and intriguing\nfacts about theorizing in this area (the study of faith, faithfulness,\nand related phenomena), is that people have offered radically\ndifferent accounts of what faith is\u2014to such an extent that there\nremains disagreement even about the basic ontological category to\nwhich faith belongs. Is it a psychological state and, if so, is it\ncognitive, affective/evaluative, or perhaps some combination of both?\nIs it an act or disposition to act\u2014or is there at least some\nsort of connection to action essential to faith and, if so, to what\nsorts of acts?\n\nThis entry will focus on religious faith as paradigmatic\u2014or,\nrather, it will focus on the kind of faith exemplified in theistic\nfaith (i.e., faith in God, faith that God exists, and commitment\nto a theistic interpretation of reality), while leaving open whether\nfaith of that same general kind also belongs to other,\nnon-theistic, religious contexts, or to contexts not usually thought\nof as religious at all. The question of faith outside of a theistic\ncontext, such as whether it is apt to speak of the faith of a\nhumanist, or even an atheist, using the same general sense of\n\u2018faith\u2019 as applies to the theist case, is taken up in the\nfinal Section (11).\n\nPhilosophical reflection on theistic religious faith has produced\nmarkedly different accounts or models of its nature. This entry\norganizes discussion of accounts or models of faith around key\ncomponents that feature in such accounts\u2014with varying emphases,\nand with varying views about how these components relate to one\nanother. These components are the cognitive, the\naffective, the evaluative, and the\npractical (volitional, actional and behavioural). Models of\nfaith may also be usefully categorized according to further\nprinciples, including\n\nhow the model relates faith as a state to the actional components\nassociated with faith;\nwhether the model takes the object of faith to be exclusively\npropositional (e.g., faith that such and such) or not (e.g., faith in\npersons or ideals);\nthe type of epistemology with which the model is\nassociated\u2014whether it is broadly \u2018internalist\u2019 or\n\u2018externalist\u2019, \u2018evidentialist\u2019 or\n\u2018fideist\u2019;\nwhether the model is necessarily restricted to theistic religious\nfaith, or may extend beyond it.\n\n\nThe entry proceeds dialectically, with later sections presupposing the\nearlier discussion.

Models of faith and their key components\n\nWhile philosophical reflection on faith of the kind exemplified in\nreligious contexts might ideally hope to yield an agreed definition in\nterms of necessary and sufficient conditions that articulate the\nnature of faith, the present discussion proceeds by identifying key\ncomponents that recur in different accounts of religious faith. It\nalso aims to identify a focal range of issues on which different\nstances are taken by different accounts. There is a plurality of\nexisting philosophical understandings or models of faith of the\nreligious kind. This discussion therefore aims to set out\ndialectically an organisation of this plurality, while also giving\nindications of the reasons there may be for preferring particular\nmodels over others. Since \u2018religion\u2019 itself may well be a\n\u2018family resemblance\u2019 universal, essentialism about faith\nof the religious kind might be misplaced. Nevertheless, the concept of\nfaith as found in the Abrahamic, theist, religious traditions is\nwidely regarded as unified enough for an inquiry into its nature to\nmake sense, even if a successful real definition is too much to expect\n(this kind of faith might conceivably be a conceptual primitive, for\nexample).\n\nNote that some philosophers approach the target of religious faith by\nfirst classifying and analysing ordinary language uses of the term\n\u2018faith\u2019 and locutions in which that term occurs. See, for\nrecent examples, Audi 2011 (Chapter 3, Section I), who identifies\nseven different kinds of faith, and Howard-Snyder (2013b), who\nattempts a general analysis of \u2018propositional\u2019\nfaith\u2014i.e., faith that p is true, where p is a relevant\nproposition. The present discussion, however, deals directly with the\ntarget notion of the kind of faith exemplified in religious\nfaith, assuming the background of a working grasp of the notion\nas deployed in religious forms of life, and specifically in those\nbelonging to the theist traditions. Insights from the analysis of\nfaith understood more broadly may, nevertheless, be important in\nconstructing models of faith of the religious kind, as will emerge\nbelow in the discussion of religious faith as a kind of trust (Section\n6).\n\nThe notion of religious faith as the possession of a whole people is\nfamiliar, and arguably theologically primary in the theist traditions.\nPhilosophical accounts of theistic faith typically focus, however, on\nwhat it is for an individual person to \u2018have faith\u2019 or be\n\u2018a person of faith\u2019. An initial broad distinction is\nbetween thinking of faith just as a person\u2019s state when\nthat person \u2018has faith\u2019, and thinking of it as also\ninvolving a person\u2019s act, action or activity.\nFaith may be a state one is in, or comes to be in; it may also\nessentially involve something one does. An adequate account of faith,\nperhaps, needs to encompass both. In the Christian context, faith is\nunderstood both as a gift of God and also as requiring a human\nresponse of assent and trust, so that their faith is something with\nrespect to which people are both receptive and active.\n\nThere is, however, some tension in understanding faith both as a gift\nto be received and as essentially involving a venture to be willed and\nenacted. A philosophical account of faith may be expected to\nilluminate this apparent paradox. One principle for classifying models\nof faith is according to the extent to which they recognise an active\ncomponent in faith itself, and the way they identify that active\ncomponent and its relation to faith\u2019s other components. It is\nhelpful to consider the components of faith (variously recognised and\nemphasised in different models of faith) as falling into three broad\ncategories: the affective, the cognitive and the\npractical. There are also evaluative components in\nfaith\u2014these may appear as implicated in the affective and/or the\ncognitive components, according to one\u2019s preferred meta-theory\nof value.\n2. The affective component of faith\n\nOne component of faith is a certain kind of affective psychological\nstate\u2014namely, having a feeling of assurance or trust. Some\nphilosophers hold that faith is to be identified simply with such a\nstate: see, for example, Clegg (1979, 229) who suggests that this may\nhave been Wittgenstein\u2019s understanding. Faith in this\nsense\u2014as one\u2019s overall \u2018default\u2019 affective\nattitude on life\u2014provides a valuable foundation for flourishing:\nits loss is recognised as the psychic calamity of \u2018losing\none\u2019s faith\u2019. But if foundational existential assurance is\nto feature in a model of faith of the kind exemplified by theists,\nmore needs to be added about the kind of assurance involved. The\nassurance of theistic faith is essentially a kind of confidence: it is\nessentially faith in God. In general, faith of the kind\nexemplified by theistic faith must have some intentional\nobject. It may thus be argued that an adequate model of this kind\nof faith cannot reduce to something purely affective: some\nbroadly cognitive component is also required. (For an account\nthat takes faith to be fundamentally affective, while allowing that it\nmight also involve cognitive aspects, see Kvanvig 2013.)\n3. Faith as knowledge\n\nWhat kind of cognitive component belongs to faith, then? One\npossibility is that it is a kind of knowledge, but there is\nthen a question about the kind of knowledge that it is: e.g., is it\nknowledge \u2018by acquaintance\u2019, or\n\u2018propositional\u2019 knowledge \u2018by description\u2019, or\nboth? One type of model of faith as knowledge identifies faith as\npropositional knowledge of specific truths, revealed by God. A model\nof this type has received prominent recent defence in the work of\nAlvin Plantinga, who proposes an account which he regards as following\nin the tradition of the reformers, principally John Calvin (see\nPlantinga 2000, 168\u201386). Calvin defines faith thus: \u2018a\nfirm and certain knowledge of God\u2019s benevolence towards us,\nfounded upon the truth of the freely given promise in Christ, both\nrevealed to our minds and sealed upon our hearts through the Holy\nSpirit\u2019 (John Calvin, Institutes III, ii, 7, 551,\nquoted by Plantinga (2000, 244)).\n\nAppeal to a special cognitive faculty\n\n\u2018Reformed\u2019 epistemologists have appealed to an externalist\nepistemology in order to maintain that theistic belief may be\njustified even though its truth is no more than basically\nevident to the believer\u2014that is, its truth is not rationally\ninferable from other, more basic, beliefs, but is found to be\nimmediately evident in the believer\u2019s experience (see Plantinga\nand Wolterstorff 1983, Alston 1991, Plantinga 2000). On\nPlantinga\u2019s version, (basic) theistic beliefs count as knowledge\nbecause they are produced by the operation of a special cognitive\nfaculty whose functional design fits it for the purpose of generating\ntrue beliefs about God. Plantinga calls this the sensus\ndivinitatis, using a term of Calvin\u2019s. (For discussion of\nthe extent to which Plantinga\u2019s use of this term conforms to\nCalvin\u2019s own usage see Jeffreys 1997 and Helm 1998.) This\nquasi-perceptual faculty meets functional criteria as a mechanism\nthat, when functioning in the right conditions, confers\n\u2018warrant\u2019 (where warrant is whatever must be added to true\nbelief to yield knowledge) and, granted theism\u2019s truth, it\nprobably yields \u2018basic\u2019 knowledge because God designs it\njust for that purpose. In defence of specifically Christian belief,\nPlantinga argues that the same warrant-conferring status belongs to\nthe operation of the Holy Spirit in making the great truths of the\nGospel directly known to the believer.\n\nThe welcome certainty of faith\n\nThis appeal to a God-given \u2018higher\u2019 cognitive faculty is\nfound (in the early 12th Century) in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s\nDeliverance from Error, where it provides the key to the\n\u2018Sufi\u2019 resolution of his religious crisis and his\nsceptical doubts about the deliverances of sense perception and\nunassisted human reason. Faith is thus understood as a kind of basic\nknowledge attended by a certainty that excludes doubt. But faith will\nnot be exclusively cognitive, if, as in Calvin\u2019s definition,\nfaith-knowledge is not only \u2018revealed to our minds\u2019 but\nalso \u2018sealed upon our hearts\u2019. For, on this model, faith\nwill also have an affective/evaluative component that includes a\nwelcoming of the knowledge received.\n\nPractical aspects of faith on this model\n\nThis model of faith as a kind of knowledge, certain and welcome,\nexhibits faith as essentially something to be received, something\ndelivered by the proper functioning of a special cognitive faculty.\nNevertheless, the model may admit a practical component, since an\nactive response is required for reception of the divine gift. Such a\npractical component is implied by the real possibility that faith may\nbe resisted: indeed, Christians may hold that in our sinful state we\nwill inevitably offer a resistance to faith that may be overcome only\nby God\u2019s grace. It is, however, a further step for persons of\nfaith to put their revealed knowledge into practice by trusting their\nlives to God and seeking to obey his will. On this \u2018special\nknowledge\u2019 model of faith, however, this activity counts as\n\u2018acting out\u2019 one\u2019s faith rather than as a part of\nfaith itself. Persons of faith thus act \u2018in\u2019,\n\u2018through\u2019 or \u2018by\u2019 faith: but, on this model,\ntheir faith itself is the welcomed revealed knowledge on which they\nact.\n4. Faith and reason: the epistemology of faith\n\nModels of faith as knowledge may be thought lacking because they admit\nno actional component in faith itself. Faith seems essentially to\ninvolve some kind of active venture in commitment and trust,\neven if talk of a \u2018leap of faith\u2019 may not be wholly apt.\nMany have held that faith ventures beyond what is ordinarily\nknown or justifiably held true, in the sense that faith involves\naccepting what cannot be established as true through the proper\nexercise of our naturally endowed human cognitive faculties. As Kant\nfamously reports, in the Preface to the Second Edition of his\nCritique of Pure Reason: \u2018I have \u2026 found it\nnecessary to deny knowledge, in order to make room for\nfaith\u2019 (Kant 1787 [1933, 29]). Theist philosophers do,\nhowever, typically defend the claim that faith is not \u2018contrary\nto reason\u2019. On models of faith that take a cognitive component\nas central, and construe faith\u2019s object as propositional,\nreasonable faith therefore seems subject to a general\nevidentialist principle\u2014\u2018a wise man ...\nproportions his belief to the evidence\u2019, as Hume puts it (Hume\n1748 [2007], \u201cOf Miracles\u201d, 80). And W. K. Clifford\nelevates evidentialism to the status of an absolute moral requirement,\naffirming that \u2018it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone\nto believe anything upon insufficient evidence\u2019 (Clifford 1877\n[1999, 77]. Faith\u2019s venturesomeness may thus seem in tension\nwith its reasonableness, and models of faith differ in the way they\nnegotiate this tension in response to evidentialist challenges.\nAnother way to classify models of faith, then, is in terms of their\nassociated epistemology\u2014and, in particular, whether and\naccording to what norms of \u2018evidential support\u2019, they\naccept that faith\u2019s cognitive component needs to meet a\nrequirement to be grounded on available evidence.\n\nThe Reformed epistemologist model of faith as \u2018basic\u2019\nknowledge (outlined in Section 3) generates an epistemology under\nwhich, although ordinary cognitive faculties and sources of evidence\ndo not yield firm and certain inferred knowledge of theistic truths,\nthere is (if Christian theism is true) a \u2018higher\u2019\ncognitive faculty that neatly makes up the deficit. This model seems\nthus to secure the rationality of faith: if faith consists in beliefs\nthat have the status of knowledge, faith can hardly fail to be\nrational. And, once the deliverances of the special cognitive faculty\nare included amongst the believer\u2019s basic experiential evidence,\nan evidential requirement on reasonable belief seems to be met. (Note\nthat Plantinga originally expressed his defence of \u2018properly\nbasic\u2019 theistic belief in terms of the rationality of believing\nin God \u2018without any evidence or argument at all\u2019\n(Plantinga 1983, 17). He does respect an evidential requirement,\nhowever, holding that it may be fully met through what is basically,\nnon-inferentially, evident in the believer\u2019s experience. Hence\nPlantinga\u2019s insistence that his Reformed epistemology is not\nfideistic (Plantinga 2000, 263).)\n\nReflective faith and the question of entitlement\n\nIt is not clear, however, whether Reformed epistemology\u2019s model\nof faith can achieve all that is needed to show that theist faith is\nreasonable. From the perspective of reflective persons of faith (or\nwould-be faith), the question of entitlement arises: are they\nrationally, epistemically\u2014even, morally\u2014entitled to adopt\nor continue in their faith? This question will be existentially\nimportant, since faith will not be of the kind exemplified by\nreligious faith unless its commitments make a significant difference\nto how one lives one\u2019s life. Reflective believers, who are aware\nof the many options for faith and the possibility of misguided and\neven harmful faith-commitments, will wish to be satisfied that they\nare justified in their faith. The theist traditions hold a\ndeep fear of idolatry\u2014of giving one\u2019s \u2018ultimate\nconcern\u2019 (Tillich 1957 [2001]) to an object unworthy of it. The\ndesire to be assured of entitlement to faith is thus not merely\nexternally imposed by commitment to philosophical critical values: it\nis a demand internal to the integrity of theistic faith itself.\nArguably, believers must even take seriously the possibility that the\nGod they have been worshipping is not, after all, the true God\n(Johnston 2009). But, for this concern to be met, there will need to\nbe conditions sufficient for justified faith that are\n\u2018internalist\u2019\u2014that is, conditions whose obtaining\nis, at least indirectly if not directly, accessible to believers\nthemselves. And, as already noted, those conditions are widely assumed\nto include an evidentialist requirement that faith is justified only\nif the truth of its cognitive content is adequately supported by the\navailable evidence.\n\nThe Reformed epistemologist model as leaving the question of\nentitlement unanswered\n\nIt may be argued, however, that, if the Reformed\nepistemologist\u2019s model is correct, those who seek to meet an\nevidentialist requirement will be unable to satisfy themselves of\ntheir entitlement to their faith. Theistic truths may be directly\nrevealed, and experienced as immediately evident, yet, on reflection,\none may doubt whether such experiences are genuinely revelatory since\ncompeting \u2018naturalist\u2019 interpretations of those\nexperiences seem available. Furthermore, there are rival sources\nyielding contrary claims that equally claim to be authentically\nrevelatory. It may be true, as Plantinga\u2019s Reformed epistemology\nmaintains, that if God exists then certain basic theist\nbeliefs meet externalist criteria for knowledge, even though the truth\nof the propositions concerned remains open to reflective\n\u2018internalist\u2019 doubt. On an externalist account, that is,\none might lack independent evidence sufficient to confirm that one has\nknowledge that God exists while in fact possessing that very\nknowledge. One may thus refute an objector who claims that\nwithout adequate evidence one cannot possess knowledge. But this\nconsideration is still insufficient to secure entitlement to theistic\nfaith\u2014if, as may be argued, that entitlement requires that\none has evidence adequate to justify commitment to the truth\nthat God exists. For, one has such evidence only conditionally on\nGod\u2019s existence\u2014but it is precisely entitlement to\nbelieve that God exists that is at issue (Kenny 1992, 71; Bishop and\nAijaz 2004). For a wider discussion of the possibility of religious\nknowledge that, inter alia, endorses the present point, see\nZagzebski 2010.\n5. Faith as belief\n\nIf faith is not \u2018firm and certain\u2019 basic knowledge of\ntheistic truths, then a model of faith as having a propositional\nobject may still be retained by identifying faith with belief\nof relevant content\u2014and the question whether a faith-belief may\nhave sufficient justification to count (if true) as (non-basic)\nknowledge may remain open. To have theist faith might thus be\nidentified with holding a belief with theological content\u2014that\nGod exists, is benevolent towards us, has a plan of salvation,\netc.\u2014where this belief is also held with sufficient firmness and\nconviction. Richard Swinburne labels this the \u2018Thomist\nview\u2019 of faith, and expresses it thus: \u2018The person of\nreligious faith is the person who has the theoretical conviction that\nthere is a God\u2019 (Swinburne 2005, 138). (Aquinas\u2019s own\nunderstanding of faith is more complex than this formulation suggests,\nhowever, as will be noted shortly.)\n\nThe rationality of faith on this model will rest on the rationality of\nthe firmly held theological beliefs in which it consists. As Swinburne\nnotes, if such beliefs are founded on evidence that renders their\ntruth sufficiently more probable than not, then the beliefs concerned\nmay amount to knowledge on a contemporary \u2018justified true\nbelief\u2019 fallibilist epistemology, even though they fall short of\nknowledge on Aquinas\u2019s own criteria, which require that what is\nknown be \u2018seen\u2019 (i.e., fully and directly comprehended)\n(Summa Theologiae 2a2ae 1, 4 & 5 (Aquinas 1265\u20131273\n[2006], 27)). In any case, the reasonableness of faith on this model\nof faith as (non-basic) theological belief depends on the beliefs\nconcerned being adequately evidentially justified. The claim that this\ncondition is satisfied is defended by John Locke in The\nReasonableness of Christianity (1695 [1999]), and, in\ncontemporary philosophy, by Richard Swinburne\u2019s Bayesian\napproach to the epistemology of Christian belief (see, for example,\nSwinburne 2003).\n\nSome argue, however, that the truth of theism is \u2018evidentially\nambiguous\u2019\u2014that is, that our total available evidence is\nequally viably interpreted from both a theist and a naturalist/atheist\nperspective (Hick 1966 and 1989; Davis 1978; Penelhum 1995; McKim\n2001). This thesis of evidential ambiguity may be supported as the\nbest explanation of the diversity of belief on religious matters,\nand/or of the persistence of the debate about theism, with\nphilosophers of equal acumen and integrity engaged on either side. Or\nthe ambiguity may be considered systematic\u2014for example, on the\ngrounds that both natural theological and natural atheological\narguments fail because they are deeply circular, resting on implicit\nassumptions acceptable only to those already thinking within the\nrelevant perspective. (In relation to Swinburne\u2019s Bayesian\nnatural theology, in particular, this objection surfaces in criticism\nof assumptions about how to set the prior probabilities implicated in\ncalculations of, for example, theism\u2019s probability on the\nevidence of the \u2018fine-tuning\u2019 of the Universe\u2019s\nbasic physical constants, or of the probability, on all our evidence,\nof the truth of the Resurrection.) If the ambiguity thesis is correct,\nthen\u2014assuming evidentialism\u2014firmly held theistic belief\nwill fail to be reasonable.\n\nOn this model of faith as non-basic belief, all that characterizes\nfaith apart from its theological content is the firmness or conviction\nwith which faith-propositions are held true. Firm belief in the truth\nof a scientific theoretical proposition, for example, fails to count\nas faith only through lacking the right kind of content. This\nmodel therefore shares with the Reformed epistemologist model in\ntaking its theological content as essential to what makes theistic\nfaith faith, and so rejects the suggestion that faith of the\nsame sort as found in the theist religious traditions might also be\nfound elsewhere.\n\nFurthermore, in taking faith to consist in non-basic belief that\ntheological propositions are true, this model invites the assumption\nthat theological convictions belong in the same category of factual\nclaims as scientific theoretical hypotheses with which they\naccordingly compete. That assumption will lead those who think that\ntheological claims are not reasonably accepted on the\nevidence to regard faith as worthless and intellectually\ndishonourable\u2014at best, \u2018a degenerating research\nprogramme\u2019 (Lakatos 1970). (On this negative assessment of\nfaith\u2019s evidential support, persons of faith come perilously\nclose to the schoolboy\u2019s definition mentioned by William James:\n\u2018Faith is when you believe something that you know ain\u2019t\ntrue\u2019 (James 1896 [1956, 29]). Or, if persons who have theistic\nfaith readily abandon theological explanations whenever competing\nscientific ones succeed, their God gets reduced to \u2018the God of\nthe gaps\u2019.) These misgivings about the model of faith as firmly\nheld factual theological belief dissolve, of course, if success\nattends the project of showing that particular theological claims\ncount as factual hypotheses well supported by the total available\nevidence. Those who doubt that this condition is or can be met may,\nhowever, look towards a model of faith that understands faith\u2019s\ncognitive content as playing some other role than that of an\nexplanatory hypothesis of the same kind as a scientific explanatory\nhypothesis.\n\nAquinas\u2019s account of faith\n\nThough firmly held theological belief is central to it,\nAquinas\u2019s understanding of faith is more complicated and nuanced\nthan the view that faith is \u2018the theoretical conviction that God\nexists\u2019. Aquinas holds that faith is \u2018midway between\nknowledge and opinion\u2019 (Summa Theologiae 2a2ae 1, 2\n(Aquinas [2006], 11)). Faith resembles knowledge, Aquinas thinks, in\nso far as faith carries conviction. But that conviction is not well\ndescribed as \u2018theoretical\u2019, if that description suggests\nthat faith has a solely propositional object. For Aquinas,\nfaith denotes the believer\u2019s fundamental orientation towards the\ndivine. So \u2018from the perspective of the reality believed\nin\u2019, Aquinas says, \u2018the object of faith is something\nnon-composite\u2019 (hence, definitely not\npropositional)\u2014namely God himself. Nevertheless, grasping the\ntruth of propositions is essential to faith, because\n\u2018from the perspective of the one believing \u2026 the\nobject of faith is something composite in the form of a\nproposition\u2019 (Summa Theologiae, 2a2ae, 1, 2 (Aquinas\n[2006], 11 & 13), our emphases).\n\nA further problem with describing as Thomist a model of faith simply\nas firm belief that certain theological propositions are true is that\nAquinas takes as central an act of \u2018inner assent\u2019\n(Summa Theologiae, 2a2ae, 2, 1 (Aquinas [2006],\n59\u201365)). This is problematic because, (i) in its dominant\ncontemporary technical usage belief is taken to be a mental\n(intentional) state\u2014a propositional attitude, namely,\nthe attitude towards the relevant proposition that it is true; (ii)\nbelief in this contemporary sense is widely agreed not to be under\nvolitional control\u2014not directly, anyway; yet (iii) Aquinas holds\nthat the assent given in faith is under the control of the will.\nAquinas need not, however, be construed as accepting \u2018believing\nat will\u2019, since assent may be construed as an act that has to be\nelicited yet terminates a process that is subject to the will\u2014a\nprocess of inquiry, deliberation or pondering that involves mental\nactions, or, in the case of theist faith, a process of divine grace\nthat can proceed only if it is not blocked by the will.\n\nMost importantly, however, Aquinas says that assent is given to the\npropositional articles of faith because their truth is revealed by\nGod, and on the authority of the putative source of this\nrevelation. Terence Penelhum puts it like this: \u2018Thomas tells us\nthat although what one assents to in faith includes many items not\nostensibly about God himself, one assents to them, in faith, because\nthey are revealed by God \u2026 It is because they come from him and\nbecause they lead to him that the will disposes the intellect to\naccept them\u2019 (Penelhum 1989, 122: see Summa Theologiae,\n2a2ae, 1, 1 & 2 (Aquinas [2006], 5\u201315)). So, Aquinas\u2019s\nmodel of faith is of believing (assenting to) propositional\ntruth-claims on the basis of testimony carrying divine\nauthority. John Locke follows the same model: \u2018Faith\n\u2026 is the assent to any proposition \u2026 upon the credit of\nthe proposer, as coming from God, in some extraordinary way of\ncommunication\u2019 (Locke 1698 [1924, 355]; compare also Alston\n1996, 15).\n\nThe unanswered question of entitlement\u2014again\n\nTheist faith as assent to truths on the basis of an authoritative\nsource of divine revelation is possible, though, only for those\nwho already believe that God exists and is revealed through\nthe relevant sources. Might such faith, then, have to rest on a\nprior faith\u2014faith that God exists and that\nthis is God\u2019s messenger or vehicle of communication?\nThose foundational claims, it might be maintained, are held true on\nthe grounds of adequately supporting evidence, such as putatively\nprovided by arguments of natural theology and the claimed evidence for\nmiraculous endorsement of a prophet\u2019s authority. Theist faith\nmight then have a purely rational foundation. But this could hardly be\nso for every person of faith, since not everyone who believes\nwill have access to the relevant evidence or be able to assess it\nproperly. Besides, and more importantly, although Aquinas allows that\nrational assessment of the available evidence may lead a person to\nfaith, he does not think that such an assessment could ever elicit\nassent itself\u2014only demonstration could achieve that and so high\na level of proof is not here available (see Aquinas [2006], footnote\n2b, 58\u20139). Aquinas\u2019s view is thus that all\nbelievers stand in need of God\u2019s grace: \u2018the assent of\nfaith, which is its principal act \u2026 has as its cause God,\nmoving us inwardly through grace\u2019 (Summa Theologiae,\n2a2ae 6, 1 (Aquinas [2006], 167)). It follows, then, that, on\nAquinas\u2019s view, believing that God exists and is revealed in\nspecific ways is itself a matter of faith, and not a purely\nrationally evidentially secured prolegomenon to it.\n\nAquinas\u2019s model of faith thus shares with the Reformed\nepistemologist model the problem that it leaves unanswered the\nreflective believer\u2019s concern about entitlement. Attempting to\nsettle that concern by meeting the evidential requirement leads to\ncircularity: theological truths are to be accepted on divine\nauthority, yet the truth that there is such an\nauthority (historically mediated as the relevant tradition\nmaintains) is amongst those very truths that are to be accepted on\ndivine authority\u2014indeed, it is the crucial one. As Descartes\nputs it in the Dedication to his Meditations, \u2018It is of\ncourse quite true that we must believe in the existence of God because\nit is a doctrine of Holy Scripture, and conversely, that we must\nbelieve Holy Scripture because it comes from God. \u2026 But this\nargument cannot be put to unbelievers because they would judge it to\nbe circular\u2019 (Descartes 1641 [Cottingham et al. 1984, 3]). Thus,\nalthough they differ on the question whether the firm beliefs of faith\ncount as knowledge, both Aquinas and Calvin understand faith as\nessentially involving accepting the truth of propositions as revealed\nthrough willingly receiving God\u2019s gracious gift of that very\nrevelation. The question remains how accepting this gift could be\nepistemically rational. The externalist account of how Christian\nbeliefs may have epistemic worth proposed in Plantinga\u2019s model\nof faith (named \u2018the A/C\u2019 model because its sources are\nsupposedly found in Aquinas as well as Calvin) offers some help with\nthe required explanation, but (as noted in the final paragraph of\nSection 4 above) may arguably not by itself be sufficient.\n\nRevelation\u2014and its philosophical critique\n\nThe reasonableness of belief that God exists is a focal issue in the\nPhilosophy of Religion. Theist traditions typically, or some would say\nessentially, make a foundational claim about an authoritative source,\nor sources, of revealed truth. What is salient includes belief or some\nrelated sort of affirmation, not just that God exists but associated\ncontent such as that this God exists, the God who is revealed\nthus and so (in great historical acts, in prophets, in scriptures, in\nwisdom handed down, etc.). The reasonableness of theism is therefore\nas much a matter of the reasonableness of an epistemology of\nrevelation as it is of a metaphysics of perfect being. The question of\nhow God may be expected to make himself known has gained prominence\nthrough recent discussion of the argument for atheism from\n\u2018divine hiddenness\u2019 (Schellenberg 1993; Howard-Snyder and\nMoser 2002). That argument holds that a loving God would make his\nexistence clear to the non-resistant\u2014but this claim is open to\nquestion. Perhaps God provides only \u2018secret\u2019 evidence of\nhis existence, purposely overturning the expectations of our\n\u2018cognitive idolatry\u2019 in order to transform our egocentric\nself-reliance (Moser 2008); besides, there may be significant\nconstraints logically inherent in the very possibility of unambiguous\ndivine revelation to finite minds (King 2008).\n\nSimilarly, accounts of theistic faith will be open to critique when\nthey make assumptions about the mechanisms of revelation. In\nparticular, the model of faith as assent to propositions as revealed\nholds that, since God\u2019s grace is required for that assent, when\ngrace is effective the whole \u2018package deal\u2019 of\npropositional revealed truth is accepted. This yields the notion of\n\u2018the Faith\u2019, as the body of theological truths to\nbe accepted by \u2018the faithful\u2019, and it becomes a sign of\nresistance to divine grace to \u2018pick and choose\u2019 only some\ntruths, as heretics do (Greek: hairesis, choice; see\nSumma Theologiae 2a2ae 5, 3 (Aquinas [2006], 157\u201361)).\nFor heresy to be judged, however, some human authority must assume it\npossesses the full doctrinal revelation, with God\u2019s grace\noperating without resistance in its own case. Whether that assumption\ncan ever be sufficiently well founded to justify condemning and\npurging others is an important question, whose neglect may be\nseriously harmful, as we are reminded by the fact that the phrase for\n\u2018act of faith\u2019 in\nPortuguese\u2014auto-da-f\u00e9\u2014came to mean the\npublic burning of a heretic.\n\nBut the deeper assumption made by this model of faith as non-basic\n(justified) belief (as, too, by the model of it as basic knowledge\nyielded by the proper functioning of a special cognitive faculty) is\nthat God\u2019s self-revelation is primarily the revelation of the\ntruth of propositions articulated in human language (compare Swinburne\n1992). Alternative understandings of revelation are available,\nhowever. In particular, it may be held that it is primarily the\ndivine itself that is revealed\u2014the reality, not merely a\nrepresentation of it. (See Lebens 2023 for discussion of faith as\nknowledge by acquaintance with God from a Jewish perspective).\nPropositional articulations of what is revealed may still be\nessential, but they need to be accepted as at a remove from the object\nof revelation itself, and therefore as limited. The development of\npropositional articulations expressing the nature and will of the\nself-revealing God\u2014the doctrines of \u2018the\nFaith\u2019\u2014will, of course, be understood as a process under\nprovidential grace. It is often assumed that that process can achieve\n\u2018closure\u2019 in a completed set of infallibly known creedal\npropositions. But this assumption about how divine inspiration\noperates may be contested, both on the theological grounds that it\nreflects the all-too-human desire to gain control over God\u2019s\nself-revelation (to \u2018pin God down once and for all\u2019), and\non the wider epistemological grounds that any attempt to grasp\nindependent reality in human language will be in principle limited and\nfallible, subject to revision in the light of future experience.\n6. Faith as an act of trust\n\nNot all models of faith, however, identify it as primarily a matter of\nknowing or believing a proposition or a set of them, even with the\naddition of some affective or evaluative component. What is most\ncentral to theistic faith may seem better expressed as believing\nin God, rather than as believing that God exists.\nThe Christian Nicene creed begins \u2018Credo in unum Deum\n\u2026\u2019 and it is arguable that in this context \u2018belief\nin\u2019 is neither merely an idiomatic variant on, nor reducible to,\n\u2018belief that\u2019 (Price 1965). It may thus be held that\ntheists\u2019 acceptance of propositional truths as divinely revealed\nrests on believing in God\u2014and it is this\n\u2018believing in\u2019, or \u2018having faith in\u2019, which\nis, fundamentally, the nature of faith. Noting that, while faith is\nheld to be a virtue, believing as such is not, Wilfred Cantwell Smith\nargues that \u2018faith is not belief\u2019, \u2018but something of\na quite different order\u2019 (Smith 1979, 128), requiring\n\u2018assent\u2019 \u2018in the dynamic and personal sense of\nrallying to [what one takes to be the truth] with delight and\nengagement\u2019 (142). Arguably, to put or to maintain faith\nin God involves a readiness to act, perhaps by relying on God\nin relevant ways and/or grounded in a practical commitment. Our\nconsiderations now shift, then, from propositional-attitude-focussed\nmodels of faith to those focussed on action, or what J. L.\nSchellenberg calls \u2018operational\u2019 models (2005, 126).\n\nJudeo-Christian scripture envisions humans as actively engaged in a\ncovenantal relationship with God. Their ongoing participation in, and\ncommitment to, such a relationship paradigmatically involves both\nfaith in God and faithfulness to God (McKaughan and Howard-Snyder\n2022a and 2023a; Pace and McKaughan 2020). The kind of faith of which\nChristian faith is a paradigm case, then, may be understood as\n\u2018action-centred commitment\u2019 (McKaughan 2016, 78), e.g., to\nthe Christian \u2018way\u2019. Arguably, faith understood as a\ncombination of affective and cognitive elements would miss its\nessential active component. We now turn, then, to consider a\nfiducial model\u2014a model of faith as trust, understood\nnot simply as an affective state but as an action.\n\nOn a fiducial model, having faith in God is making a practical\ncommitment\u2014the kind involved in trusting God, or,\ntrusting in God. (The root meaning of the Greek\npistis, \u2018faith\u2019, is \u2018trust\u2019 (see\nMorgan 2015).) On such a model, faith\u2019s active, practical\ncomponent takes central place, though a cognitive component may be\npresupposed by it. Swinburne calls it the \u2018Lutheran\u2019\nmodel, and defines it thus: \u2018the person of faith does not merely\nbelieve that there is a God (and believe certain propositions about\nhim)\u2014he trusts Him and commits himself to Him\u2019 (2005,\n142). Yet, as noted earlier, Aquinas too takes the ultimate object of\nfaith to be God, \u2018the first reality\u2019, and, furthermore,\nunderstands \u2018formed\u2019 faith as trusting commitment to God,\nmotivated by, and directed towards, love of God as one\u2019s true\nend (see Summa Theologiae 2a2ae, 4, 3; Aquinas [2006],\n123\u20137). It is true that Aquinas allows that the devils have\nfaith in a certain sense, but this \u2018faith\u2019 amounts only to\ntheir belief that what the Church teaches is the truth, arrived at not\nby grace but \u2018forced from them\u2019 reluctantly by \u2018the\nacumen of their natural intelligence\u2019 (Summa Theologiae\n2a2ae, 5, 2; Aquinas [2006], 155 & 157). Aquinas\u2019s account\nof \u2018saving\u2019 faith is thus also a fiducial model.\n\nThe venture of trust\n\nAs noted at the outset, there is a usage of \u2018faith\u2019 for\nwhich \u2018having/placing faith in\u2019 is (near enough)\nsynonymous with \u2018trusting\u2019 or \u2018trusting in\u2019.\n(For discussion of how faith relates to a range of contemporary\ntheories of trust, see McKaughan and Howard-Snyder 2022b.) If,\nmoreover, faith of the religious kind is itself a type of trust, then\nwe may expect our understanding of religious faith to profit from an\nanalysis of trust in general. It is therefore worth considering what\nfollows about the nature of faith of the sort exemplified in theistic\nfaith from holding it to be a kind of active trust.\n\nConceptually fundamental to trust is the notion of a person (or\npersons)\u2014the truster\u2014trusting in some agent or\nagency\u2014the trustee\u2014for some (assumedly)\nfavourable outcome (though what the trustee is trusted for is often\nonly implicit in the context). Trust involves a venture; so\ntoo\u2014it is widely agreed\u2014does faith. So, if faith is trust,\nthe venture of faith might be presumed to be the type of venture\nimplicated in trust. A venture is an action that places the agent and\noutcomes of concern to the agent significantly beyond the\nagent\u2019s own control. Trust implies venture. When we trust we\ncommit ourselves to another\u2019s control, accepting\u2014and, when\nnecessary, co-operating as \u2018patient\u2019\u2014with the\ndecisions of the trustee. Venturing in trust is usually assumed to be\nessentially risky, making oneself vulnerable to adverse\noutcomes or betrayal. Swinburne makes the point this way: \u2018To\ntrust someone is to act on the assumption that she will do for you\nwhat she knows that you want or need, when the evidence gives some\nreason for supposing that she may not and where there will be bad\nconsequences if the assumption is false\u2019 (2005, 143). Annette\nBaier makes no requirement for evidence that the trustee may prove\nuntrustworthy, but nevertheless takes trust to involve \u2018accepted\nvulnerability to another\u2019s possible but not expected\nill will (or lack of good will) toward one\u2019 (Baier 1986, 235,\nour emphasis). Accordingly, it seems sensible to hold that one should\ntrust only with good reason. But if, as is plausible, good reason to\ntrust requires sufficient evidence of the trustee\u2019s\ntrustworthiness, reasonable trust appears both to have its\nventuresomeness diminished and, at the same time, to become more\ndifficult to achieve than we normally suppose. For we often lack\nadequate\u2014or even, any\u2014evidence of a trustee\u2019s\ntrustworthiness in advance of our venture, yet in many such cases we\nsuppose that our trust is reasonable (see, for example, Adams 1987).\nBut, if adequate evidence of trustworthiness is not required\nfor reasonable trust, how is reasonable trust different from\n\u2018blind\u2019 trust?\n\nThe answer seems clear: reasonable trust is practically\nrational trust. The question of when one may rationally trust\nanother may thus be resolved by a decision-theoretic calculation,\nfactoring in the extent to which one\u2019s evidence supports the\npotential trustee\u2019s trustworthiness and the utilities of the\npossible outcomes, given one\u2019s intended aims. The exercise of\npractical reasoning does include mental acts which are epistemically\nevaluable, however. When one takes it to be true in practical\nreasoning that someone will prove trustworthy, that mental act may be\nmore or less epistemically rational: it would break the evidentialist\nnorm to employ in a decision-theoretic calculation a credence that\ndoes not match one\u2019s available evidence. In many situations, it\nwill be practically rational, given one\u2019s intentions, to trust\nanother person only if one believes, or, at least, believes with high\nprobability, that the person will prove trustworthy. In such\nsituations it is also often the case, as already noted, that we\ndon\u2019t have adequate evidence in advance that this\nperson will be trustworthy in this particular respect. Yet,\naffording high credence to a person\u2019s trustworthiness may still\nbe epistemically rational given wider available evidence of, for\nexample, the person\u2019s past friendliness and trustworthiness in\nother matters, or, if the person is a stranger, of our shared social\nexperience that trusting others generally elicits a trustworthy\nresponse. Nevertheless, it can still be\nrational\u2014practically rational, that is\u2014to trust\nanother when we don\u2019t have adequate evidence that they\nwill prove trustworthy. In a life-threatening situation, for example,\nit may be rational to trust unlikely rescuers if they are the only\nones available. Or, when we have wider aims, it may be practically\nrational to trust those without a record of trustworthiness, as with\n\u2018educative\u2019 and \u2018therapeutic\u2019 trust where\npeople are trusted for the sake of their development or rehabilitation\nas trustworthy persons. Being in established relationships of\nfriendship with others, too, can also require commitment to continue\nto trust them even in the face of evidence that, otherwise, would make\nit reasonable to believe them unworthy of trust.\n\nOn models that take faith of the theist kind to consist fundamentally\nin an act of trust, the analogy with interpersonal trust is\nsuggestive. When one person trusts another there seems typically\n(though not uniformly) to be a doxastic aspect (the truster\u2019s\nbelief that the trustee is trustworthy). But what\u2019s essential is\nthe fiducial aspect, which consists in an active commitment or\n\u2018entrusting\u2019 to the other. Paul Helm proposes that theist\nfaith similarly has importantly distinct doxastic and fiducial\naspects: in addition to belief about God\u2019s existence and\ntrustworthiness for salvation held with a degree of strength\nproportional to the believer\u2019s evidence, persons of faith must\nalso entrust themselves to the one on whom they rely (Helm 2000).\nWhile it is widely agreed that theist faith must have a cognitive\naspect, some philosophers hold that this need not be doxastic (as we\nshall see in Section 8).\n7. Faith as doxastic venture\n\nThere are significant differences, however, between the trusting\ninvolved in theistic faith and that involved in interpersonal trust.\nFor one thing, trusting would seem not to risk any possibility of\ndisappointment if God really is the trustee. Given the existence of\nthe God of unchanging love, one trusts in ultimately perfect safety.\nBut the venture of actually entrusting oneself to God seems to begin\nwith the challenge of being able to believe or accept that, indeed,\nthere is such a God. While some affirm that this claim is a matter of\nbasic knowledge, and some that there is sufficient evidence to justify\nit, others, as already noted, hold that everyone has to confront the\nevidential ambiguity of foundational theistic claims. For those who\nreject the model of theist faith as basic knowledge and also think\nthat the question of God\u2019s existence cannot be settled\nintellectually on the basis of the available evidence, the venture\ninvolved in trusting in God (if such there be) may seem to include a\ndoxastic venture: those who trust already venture beyond the\navailable evidence, in their very believing or\naccepting that God exists and may be relied on for salvation.\nTrusting in God seems to presuppose, in other words, trusting\nthat God exists. But, if so, the question becomes pressing\nwhether, and under what conditions, one may be entitled to such an\nevidence-transcending venture in practical commitment to a particular\nview of ultimate reality and its implications for how we should\nlive.\n\nTheological non-realism\n\nOne way to relieve this pressure is to offer a non-realist\nanalysis of theological claims. Trusting God will then not entail any\ncommitment to reality\u2019s being a certain way. Rather, on\narguably the most sophisticated kind of non-realist view, theological\nbeliefs arise because living \u2018trustingly\u2019 comes to be\nexpressed and reinforced through a culturally constructed fiction\nabout God and his great saving acts. This existential confidence may\nthen be described, using the language of the fiction, as\n\u2018trusting God\u2019 (Cupitt 1980, Geering 1994). On such a\nnon-realist account, the model of faith as trust brackets the\ncognitive component of faith, and risks becoming, in effect, a model\nof faith as purely a certain kind of affective state. But, in any\ncase, non-realist models will be rejected by those who take faith to\nhave a cognitive component that functions as a grasping\u2014or\nwould-be grasping\u2014of how things really are.\n\nDefending doxastic venture by analogy with interpersonal\ntrust?\n\nAssuming, then, that theist faith does include (under realist\nassumptions) a venture in practical commitment to truth-claims about\nultimate reality, the justifiability of such a venture might yet be\nthought defensible by analogy with interpersonal situations where\npractical commitment seems justifiably to be made beyond one\u2019s\nevidence to the claim that a person will prove trustworthy in some\nrelevant respect. Reflecting on that proposal discloses further points\nof disanalogy, however. In cases of interpersonal trust, a venture is\noften needed in initially taking the trustee to be\ntrustworthy, but evidence will inevitably later emerge which will\neither confirm or disconfirm the truth of that claim, and trust may,\nand rationally should, be withdrawn if the news is bad. But\nif\u2014as we are here assuming\u2014one ventures beyond evidential\nsupport in taking it to be true in practical reasoning that God exists\nand may be trusted for salvation, this may be a venture that is not\nconfined to initial commitment but rather persists in needing to be\nmade. This will be the case on accounts of the evidential ambiguity of\ntheism that take the ambiguity to hold in principle, ruling out any\npossibility of evidential disambiguation. Those accounts may grant, of\ncourse, that continuing to journey in theistic faith may\npsychologically reinforce one\u2019s commitment, providing subjective\nconfirmation that the theist view of reality is correct. Yet these\nreinforcing experiences, which often involve faith renewed in the face\nof apparent failures of divine love, do not possess the\nuncontroversial status of evidence that independently and\ninter-subjectively confirms the initial venture.\n\nDoxastic venture without doxastic voluntarism\n\nMany dismiss the idea that one may venture in one\u2019s very\nbelieving that God exists as committing a category error: ventures are\nvoluntary, but propositional belief is not directly under voluntary\ncontrol. Trusting God, however, entails practical commitment to\nthe truth of theological faith-propositions, and commitment to\nthe truth of a proposition in one\u2019s practical reasoning\nmay be under direct voluntary control.\n\nIt is one thing to be in the mental state of holding that the\nproposition that p is true; it is another to take it to be\ntrue that p in one\u2019s practical reasoning (although\nthese typically go together, since to hold that p is true is\nto be disposed to take it to be true that p in\npractical reasoning whenever the question whether p becomes\nsalient). Practical commitment to a faith-proposition\u2019s truth\ntherefore could be a venture: there is no category error in\nallowing this possibility. Doxastic venturing\u2014venturing in\nbelieving\u2014is thus not a matter of willing oneself to believe\nwithout adequate evidential support; rather it is a matter of taking\nan already held belief to be true in one\u2019s practical\nreasoning even though (as one may oneself recognise) its truth lacks\nsuch support.\n\nThe psychological possibility of doxastic venture\n\nSome philosophers have argued, however, that one cannot (in full\nreflective awareness, anyway) believe that p while accepting\nthat one has insufficient evidence for p\u2019s truth (Adler\n2002). The counterclaim that this is possible is defended by William\nJames, in his controversial 1896 lecture, \u2018The Will to\nBelieve\u2019 (James 1896 [1956]). James agrees that belief cannot be\ndirectly willed and must be otherwise causally evoked (he later came\nto wish that he had used \u2018The Right to Believe\u2019 as his\nlecture\u2019s title). James observes, however, that many beliefs\nhave causes that do not constitute or imply an evidential grounding of\ntheir truth. James labels such causes\n\u2018passional\u2019\u2014again, a potentially misleading term,\nsince its intended referents include much more than emotional causes\nof belief. In particular, beliefs may be caused by \u2018the\ncircumpressure of one\u2019s caste or set,\u2019 of which\none\u2019s inherited religious tradition is a paradigm case (James\n1896 [1956, 9]). James is thus able to explain the psychological\npossibility of doxastic venture: one already has a\n\u2018passionally\u2019 caused belief, which one then takes to be\ntrue in practical reasoning despite its lack of adequate evidential\ngrounding (compare Creel 1994, who similarly describes\n\u2018faith\u2019 as a \u2018non-evidential doxastic\npassion\u2019).\n\nNote that a doxastic venture model of theistic faith reconciles faith\nas gift with faith\u2019s active components: taking a\nfaith-proposition to be true in practical reasoning is a basic\n(mental) action (which leads on to further actions involved in\ntrusting God and seeking to do God\u2019s will); the gift provides\nthe motivational resources for this basic action, namely a firm belief\nin the truth of the faith-proposition, despite its lack of adequate\nevidential support. (In the next section, the possibility is\nconsidered that the gift of these motivational resources might be\neffective yet not amount to actual belief.) It is also worth noting\nthat those who find the focus on the individual something of a\ndeficiency in analytical accounts of faith (Eklund 2015) may perceive\nin James\u2019 account some acknowledgment of the social aspect of\nfaith. Arguably, the standard \u2018passional\u2019 or\n\u2018non-evidential\u2019 cause of religious belief is cultural\nimmersion within an historical faith-tradition. The motivational\nresources for faith-commitment may thus be an essentially social\npossession.\n\nExamples of doxastic venture models\n\nOn the doxastic venture model, faith involves full practical\ncommitment to a faith-proposition\u2019s truth, despite the\nrecognition that this is not \u2018objectively\u2019 justified on\nthe evidence. Kierkegaard\u2019s definition of faith as \u2018an\nobjective uncertainty held fast in an appropriation process of the\nmost passionate inwardness\u2019 in Concluding Unscientific\nPostscript (Kierkegaard 1846 [1968, 180]) is an example of a\ndoxastic venture model. So too is Paul Tillich\u2019s account of\nfaith as \u2018the state of being ultimately concerned\u2019, since\nthe claim of the object of one\u2019s ultimate concern to\n\u2018promise total fulfilment even if all other claims have to be\nsubjected to it or rejected in its name\u2019 cannot in principle be\nestablished on the basis of the evidence (Tillich 1957 [2001, 1 and\n21]).\n\nAquinas\u2019s model of faith, though widely thought of as conforming\nto an evidential requirement on belief, may arguably be open to\ninterpretation as a doxastic venture model. As noted in Section 5,\nAquinas holds that the available evidence, though it supports the\ntruth of foundational faith-propositions, does not provide what\nAquinas counts as sufficient (i.e., demonstrative) support to justify\ninner assent (in addition to references to the Summa\nTheologiae given previously, see 2a2ae. 2, 1 (Aquinas [2006],\n63); and compare also Penelhum 1989, 120). Now, whether practical\ncommitment to the truth of a given faith-proposition does or does not\nventure beyond adequate evidential support will be relative to\nassumptions about (a) where the level of evidential support required\nfor \u2018adequacy\u2019 should be set, and (b) just how firm and\ndecisive propositional faith-commitment needs to be. On some such\nassumptions, for example those made by Bayesians, the support provided\nby the evidence Aquinas adduces\u2014or, by a suitable contemporary\nupgrading of that evidence such as that provided in the works of\nRichard Swinburne\u2014may be considered enough to make reasonable a\nsufficiently high degree of belief (or credence) in the truth of\ntheistic faith-propositions so that believers need not venture beyond\nthe support of their evidence. Interpreting Aquinas\u2019s model of\nfaith as conforming to evidentialism may thus be viable. Nevertheless,\nAquinas\u2019s own assumptions on these matters may leave him closer\nto Kierkegaard and Tillich than is commonly thought (consider\nSumma Theologiae 2a2ae 4, 1 and, once again, 2a2ae 6, 1\n(Aquinas [2006], 117\u20139 & 167)).\n\nThe special role of faith-propositions\n\nBayesians might argue that there is no occasion for faith as doxastic\nventure since, once practical commitment to the truth of propositions\nis recognised as a matter of degree, whatever the state of the\navailable evidence relating to a given proposition, there will always\n(given initial credences) be a rational credence properly associated\nwith that evidence, and hence there are no possible circumstances\nwhere \u2018the evidence does not decide\u2019, so that an\nevidentialist requirement can indeed apply universally. Note, however,\nLara Buchak\u2019s (2012, 2018) discussion of ways in which Bayesians\nmight understand faith as going beyond the evidence, and her own\nproposal that faith-ventures essentially include an\nadditional practical commitment, which may be rational under\ncertain conditions, not to inquire further into evidence relevant to\nthe truth of the propositions concerned for the sole purpose of\ndeciding what to do. (For critical discussion of this kind of\nrestriction on inquiry in connection with faith commitments, see\nDormandy 2018 and Howard-Snyder and McKaughan 2022a. Katherine\nDormandy has recently proposed a positive defence of evidentialism in\nconsidering the question of what makes it good to form positive\nbeliefs about those you have faith in, including God (Dormandy\n2022).)\n\nIf the domain of faith is, as Stephen Evans puts it, \u2018the\nassumptions, convictions and attitudes which the believer brings\nto the evidence for and against religious truth\u2019 (Evans\n1985, 178), and faith\u2019s cognitive component offers a\n\u2018total interpretation\u2019 of the world of our experience\n(Hick 1966, 154), then (foundational) faith-propositions function as\n\u2018highest-order framing principles\u2019 which\nnecessarily cannot have their truth settled by appeal to the\nforce of a body of independent evidence (Bishop 2007a, 139\u201344).\nTaking such a faith-proposition to be true, then, is not something\nthat comes in degrees: either one \u2018buys into\u2019 the overall\nworldview (foundational) faith-propositions propose, or one does not.\nSuch a choice is existentially important, and settling it raises\nanxiety about exercising a responsibility that cannot\u2014without\n\u2018bad faith\u2019\u2014be transferred onto the relatively\nimpersonal function of one\u2019s reason, since a venture beyond any\ninter-subjectively rational evidential confirmation is required. The\ndoxastic venture model may thus be regarded as capturing the spiritual\nchallenge of faith more satisfactorily than do models that conform to\nevidentialism. This is because, on the doxastic venture model, faith\ninvolves a deeper surrender of self-reliant control, not only in\ntrusting God, but in accepting at the level of practical commitment\nthat there is a God\u2014indeed, this God\u2014who is to be\ntrusted.\n\n\nDoxastic venture models of faith and epistemic concern\n\nDoxastic venture in relation to faith-propositions can be justifiable,\nof course, only if there are legitimate exceptions to the\nevidentialist requirement to take a proposition to be true just to the\nextent of its evidential support\u2014and only if the legitimate\nexceptions include the kind of case involved in religious, theistic,\nfaith-commitment.\n\nA possible view of theistic faith-commitment is that it is wholly\nindependent of the epistemic concern that cares about evidential\nsupport. On this view, faith reveals its authenticity most clearly\nwhen it takes faith-propositions to be true contrary to the\nweight of the evidence. This view is widely described as\n\u2018fideist\u2019, but ought more fairly to be called\narational fideism, or, where commitment contrary to the\nevidence is positively favoured, irrational or\ncounter-rational fideism. Despite its popular attribution\nboth to the church father Tertullian and to \u2018the father of\nexistentialism\u2019, Kierkegaard, counter-rational fideism does not\nseem to have been espoused by any significant theist philosophers\n(passages in Tertullian and Kierkegaard that appear to endorse this\nposition may be interpreted as emphasizing that Christian faith\nrequires accepting, not logical contradiction, but\n\u2018contradiction\u2019 of our \u2018natural\u2019 expectations,\nwholly overturned in the revelation that the power of divine love is\ntriumphant in the Crucified One).\n\nSerious philosophical defence of a doxastic venture model of faith\nthus implies a moderate version of fideism, for which epistemic\nconcern is not overridden and for which, therefore, it is a constraint\non faith-commitment that it not accept what is known, or\njustifiably believed on the evidence, to be false. Rather, faith\ncommits itself only beyond, and not against, the\nevidence\u2014and it does so out of epistemic concern to\ngrasp truth on matters of vital existential importance. The thought\nthat one may be entitled to commit to an existentially momentous\ntruth-claim in principle undecidable on the evidence when forced to\ndecide either to do so or not is what motivates William James\u2019s\n\u2018justification of faith\u2019 in \u2018The Will to\nBelieve\u2019 (James 1896 [1956]). If such faith is to be justified,\nits cognitive content will (on realist assumptions) have to cohere\nwith our best evidence-based theories about the real world. Faith may\nextend our scientific grasp of the real, but may not counter it.\nWhether the desire to grasp more truth about the real than science can\nsupply is a noble aspiration or a dangerous delusion is at the heart\nof the debate about entitlement to faith on this moderate fideist\ndoxastic venture model.\n\nA discussion of the debate between the moderate, Jamesian, fideist and\nthe evidentialist is beyond this entry\u2019s scope. Still, it is\nworth remarking that those who think that faith understood as doxastic\nventure may be justified as reasonable face the challenge of providing\nthe tools for weeding out intuitively unreasonable forms of faith. On\nthe other side, those evidentialists who reject doxastic venture as\nalways impermissible have to consider whether taking a stance on the\nnature of reality beyond anything science can even in principle\nconfirm may not, in the end, be unavoidable, and potentially\nimplicated in the commitments required for science itself (see Bishop\n2007a, Chapters 8 and 9; Bishop 2023). For a useful recent collection\nof articles on the wider theme of the relation of religious faith to\nintellectual virtue, see Callahan and O\u2019Connor 2014.\n8. Venturing faith, without belief\n\nSome accounts allow that faith centrally involves practical commitment\nventuring beyond evidential support, yet do not require (or, even,\npermit) that the venturer actually believes the\nfaith-proposition assumed to be true. Such accounts may be described\nas proposing a \u2018non-doxastic\u2019 venture model of faith. F.\nR. Tennant holds a view of this kind: he takes faith to be the\nadoption of a line of conduct not warranted by present facts, that\ninvolves experimenting with the possible or ideal, venturing into the\nunknown and taking the risk of disappointment and defeat. Faith is not\nan attempt to will something into existence but rather treating hoped\nfor and unseen things as if they were real and then acting\naccordingly (Tennant 1943 [1989, 104]). Swinburne refers to this as\nthe \u2018pragmatist\u2019 model of faith (Swinburne 2005,\n147\u20138; Swinburne 2001, 211; compare also Golding 1990, 2003 and\nMcKaughan 2016). The origins of Swinburne\u2019s pragmatist model are\nto be found in a much earlier paper, Swinburne 1969.\n\nWilliam Alston (1996) suggests that faith may involve an active\n\u2018acceptance\u2019 rather than purely receptive belief. A\nclearly non-doxastic venture model results if acceptance is understood\non Jonathan Cohen\u2019s account under which to accept that\np is \u2018to have or adopt a policy of deeming, positing,\nor postulating that p\u2014i.e. of including that\nproposition \u2026 among one\u2019s premisses for deciding what to\ndo or think in a particular context, whether or not one feels it\nto be true that p\u2019 (Cohen 1992, 4, our emphasis). The\nfirmness of faith-commitment is then just the firmness of one\u2019s\n\u2018resolve to use [faith-claims] as a basis for\none\u2019s thought, attitude and behaviour\u2019 (Alston 1996, 17):\nthere is no firm assurance of their truth. Decisive\ncommitment in the absence of such assurance may nevertheless be\npossible, motivated (as Swinburne suggested in the first edition of\nhis Faith and Reason) by the evaluative belief that\n\u2018unless [faith-propositions are true], that which is most\nworthwhile is not to be had\u2019 (Swinburne, 1981, 117). A faith\nventure that lacks belief in the faith-proposition to which commitment\nis made need not, and probably could not, lack cognitive components\naltogether, as this suggestion of Swinburne\u2019s indicates.\n\nAndrei Buckareff (2005) and J. L. Schellenberg (2005, 138\u20139)\npropose non-doxastic (or, \u2018sub-doxastic\u2019) venture models\nof propositional faith, with Schellenberg emphasising the positive\nevaluation that persons of faith make of the truth-claim to which they\ncommit themselves. In response to Daniel Howard-Snyder (2013a)\nSchellenberg allows that faith may in some instances involve belief\nwhile still maintaining that \u2018non-doxastic religious faith\n\u2026 will turn out to be a particularly important way of having\nreligious faith as we head into the future\u2019 (2013, 262). Bishop\n(2005), in response to Buckareff, also agrees that authentic faith\nneed not always be a specifically doxastic venture. There may, then,\nbe an emerging consensus amongst proponents of venture models that\nfaith, at its core, consists in suitably motivated persistent\npractical commitment \u2018beyond the evidence\u2019 to the\npositively evaluated truth of foundational faith-claims which may, but\nneed not, actually be believed to be true.\n\nRobert Audi (2011) has also defended a non-doxastic account of faith,\ncontrasting \u2018fiducial faith\u2019 and \u2018doxastic\nfaith\u2019, and arguing that authentic religious faith need only\namount to the former. Audi\u2019s account is not strictly a\n\u2018venture\u2019 model, however, since he does not take\ncommitment beyond the support of adequate evidence to be essential.\nAudi\u2019s account suggests that religious faith is sui\ngeneris, but capable of being understood through its relations\nwith other psychological states and actions, such as beliefs,\nevaluations and practical commitments. Rational assessment of\nreligious faith, Audi thinks, must avoid treating it as implying\nbelief, while recognising that greater confidence attaches to it than\nto religious hope. For another version of a non-doxastic account of\nfaith, as a person\u2019s \u2018affective orientation or\nstance\u2019, see Jonathan Kvanvig (2013, 2018). The question whether\nfaith entails belief (even if it may not consist purely in beliefs)\nremains a lively focus of debate. For defence of the view that faith\nentails belief, see Malcolm and Scott 2016 and Mugg 2021; for\ncriticism see Howard-Snyder 2019.\n9. Faith and hope\n\nSome philosophers have suggested that the epistemological challenges\nfaced by accounts of faith as involving belief beyond the evidence may\nbe avoided by construing theist commitment as hope. Theist hope seems\nnot to be mere tenacity (\u2018clinging to one\u2019s hopes\u2019)\n(Taylor 1961), but a more complex attitude. James Muyskens suggests,\nfor example, that one who hopes \u2018keep[s] his life open or fluid\nwith respect to [a faith-proposition] p\u2014where (a)\nneither p nor not-p is certain for him, (b) he wants\np and (c) he sees p as constructively connected with\nhis own well-being and/or concept of himself as a person\u2019 (1979,\n35). Muyskens contrasts hope with faith (understood as belief),\narguing that a religion of hope is both epistemically and religiously\nsuperior to a religion of faith. But faith is not generally understood\nas competing with hope (Creel 1993), and some philosophers\nidentify faith with hoping that the claims of faith are true\n(Pojman 1986; 2003). Hope as such is an attitude rather than an active\ncommitment, and, as Audi observes, it contrasts with the attitude of\nfaith at least in this respect, namely, that surprise makes little\nsense as a response to discovering that the object of one\u2019s\nfaith is indeed the case, whereas there need be nothing inappropriate\nin surprise at the fulfilment of one\u2019s hopes (see Audi 2011,\n74).\n\nA more adequate model of faith as hope, then, may rather take faith to\nbe acting in, or from, hope. Such a model then comes close to\na non-doxastic venture model of faith, differing only in so far as\nacting from hope that God exists differs from taking this claim to be\ntrue (albeit without belief) in one\u2019s practical reasoning, but\nthis difference may be undetectable at the level of behavioral\noutcomes (see McKaughan 2013). A model of faith as acting in hope\nshares with the doxastic and non-doxastic venture models in rejecting\nthe view that faith requires cognitive certainty. But one can act in\nhope with firmness and resilience, given a strong affective/evaluative\nstance, even if one lacks belief that one\u2019s hopes will be\nfulfilled. Hoping that p, however, does not involve taking a\nstand on its being true that p, which is widely thought to be\nessential to faith.\n\nThe \u2018venture\u2019 models of faith (with or without belief) and\nthe model of faith as a venture in hope all fit the view that faith is\nconsistent with doubt, and, indeed, impossible without doubt of some\nkind, though they allow that persons who have faith may give firm and\nsustained commitment to the truth of faith-propositions in practice\n(for discussion of different kinds of doubt and their compatibility or\nincompatibility with faith and belief see Howard-Snyder 2013b, 359).\nThe \u2018certainty\u2019 of faith on these models is more a matter\nof the certainty that persons of faith find themselves\nconferring on the foundational claims of their faith, rather\nthan a matter of discovering in themselves a certain knowledge or\nintellectual conviction of the truth of these claims. It is possible,\nthen, on these accounts of faith, to be a committed person of faith\nand also an \u2018agnostic\u2019 in Thomas Huxley\u2019s original\nsense of someone who does not claim as knowledge the commitments he or\nshe nevertheless makes as a foundational practical orientation to\nreality. (For discussion of the compatibility of Muslim faith and\ndoubt, see Aijaz 2023.)\n10. Faith as a virtue\n\nFaith is traditionally regarded as one of the\n\u2018theological\u2019 virtues. If a virtue is a \u2018disposition\nof character which instantiates or promotes responsiveness to one or\nmore basic goods\u2019, then theistic faith qualifies since it is\n\u2018a responsiveness to practical hope and truth\u2019, provided\ntheistic faith-claims are indeed true (Chappell 1996, 27). Faith will\nnot, however, be a virtue as such, if it is accepted that\nfaith can be misplaced or, even, \u2018demonic\u2019, directed upon\na \u2018false ultimate\u2019 (Tillich 1957 [2001, 21]). To be\nvirtuous, faith must be faith in a worthy object: it is faith in\nGod that is the theological virtue. More generally, faith is\nvirtuous only when it is faith to which one is entitled. An account of\nthe conditions under which faith is permissible is thus the key to an\nethics of faith.\n\nOn models of faith as a (special) kind of knowledge, or as firmly held\nbelief, it may seem puzzling how faith could be a virtue\u2014unless\nsome implicit practical component emerges when such models are further\nexplicated, or, alternatively, a case may be made for the claim that\nwhat is involuntary may nevertheless be praiseworthy, with theist\nfaith as a case in point (Adams 1987). (For discussion of how faith\nmight be voluntary, even if faith entails belief, or indeed is a type\nof belief, and belief is not under our direct voluntary control, see\nRettler 2018.) Furthermore, as already suggested (Sections 4 & 5\nabove), models of faith as knowledge or belief fail to provide\nnon-circular conditions sufficient for entitlement, unless the truth\nof faith-propositions is established by independent argument and\nevidence. If faith is understood as, or as essentially including,\nbeliefs held on insufficient evidence, it is also hard to understand\nwhy Abrahamic religious traditions have valued it so highly, let alone\nwhy God might be thought to make salvation contingent on such belief\n(Kvanvig 2018, 106; McKaughan and Howard-Snyder 2021).\n\nFiducial models of faith seem more attuned to exhibiting faith as a\nvirtue, though a defence of the trustworthiness of the one who is\ntrusted for salvation may be required. Doxastic and non-doxastic\nventure models of faith can vindicate faith as a virtue, provided they\nprovide robust entitlement conditions, to ensure that not just any\n\u2018leap of faith\u2019 is permissible. The Jamesian account\nalready mentioned (Section 7) aims to meet this need. James\u2019s\nown view of what suffices to justify a faith-venture arguably needs an\nethical supplement: both the non-evidential motivation for the venture\nand its content must be morally acceptable (Bishop 2007a,\n163\u20136).\n\nIf faith of the religious kind is to count as valuable and/or\nvirtuous, it seems there must be a suitable degree of resilience in\nthe commitment made (see Howard-Snyder and McKaughan 2022b for\narguments that faith requires resilience; for discussion of the value\nand potential virtuousness or viciousness of resilient faith see\nMcKaughan and Howard-Snyder 2023a; on the rationality of resilient\nfaith see Buchak 2017, Jackson 2021, and McKaughan 2016). Persons of\nreligious faith and faithfulness both put their faith in and are\nfaithful to the object of their commitment, though the\nsalient kind of faithfulness may be a matter of the continual renewal\nof faith rather than of maintaining it unchanged (Pace and McKaughan\n2020). (See Audi 2014 for a discussion of faith and faithfulness in\nrelation to virtue. Audi defends faithfulness as, like courage, an\n\u2018adjunctive\u2019 virtue, and argues that being \u2018a person\nof faith\u2019 counts as a \u2018virtue of personality\u2019.)\n\nFaith is only one of the Christian theological virtues, of course, the\nothers being hope and charity (or love, agap\u0113): St. Paul\nfamously affirms that the greatest of these is love (I Cor. 13:13).\nThe question thus arises how these three virtues are related. One\nsuggestion is that faith is taking it to be true that there are\ngrounds for the hope that love is supreme\u2014not simply in the\nsense that love constitutes the ideal of the supreme good, but in the\nsense that living in accordance with this ideal constitutes an\nultimate salvation, fulfilment or consummation that is, in reality,\nvictorious over all that may undermine it (in a word, over evil). The\nsupremacy of love is linked to the supremacy of the divine itself,\nsince love is the essential nature of the divine. What is hoped for,\nand what faith assures us is properly hoped for, is a sharing\nin the divine itself, loving as God loves (see Brian Davies on\nAquinas, 2002). On this understanding, reducing faith to a kind of\nhope (Section 9 above) would eradicate an important relation between\nthe two\u2014namely that people of faith take reality to be such that\ntheir hope (for salvation, the triumph of the good) is well founded,\nand not merely an attractive fantasy or inspiring ideal. (See Jeffrey\n2017 for discussion of the moral permissibility of faith, particularly\nin connection with hope.)\n11. Faith beyond (orthodox) theism\n\nWhat is the potential scope of faith? On some models, the kind of\nfaith exemplified by theistic faith is found only there. On models\nwhich take faith to consist in knowledge or belief, faith is\nintrinsically linked to theological content\u2014indeed, in the case\nof Christian faith, to orthodox Christian theological\ncontent, specifiable as one unified set of doctrines conveyed to\nreceptive human minds by the operation of divine grace. The venture\nmodels, however, allow for the possibility that authentic faith may be\nvariously realised, and be directed upon different, and mutually\nincompatible, intentional objects. This pluralism is an important\nfeature of accounts of faith in the American pragmatist tradition.\nJohn Dewey strongly rejected the notion of faith as a special kind of\nknowledge (Dewey 1934, 20), as did William James, whose\n\u2018justification of faith\u2019 rests on a\npermissibility thesis, under which varied and conflicting\nfaith-commitments may equally have a place in the \u2018intellectual\nrepublic\u2019 (James 1896 [1956, 30]). Charles S. Peirce, another\ninfluential American pragmatist, arguably held a non-doxastic view of\nfaith (Pope 2018).\n\nBoth Dewey and James defend models of faith with a view to advancing\nthe idea that authentic religious faith may be found outside what is\ngenerally supposed to be theological orthodoxy. Furthermore, they\nsuggest that \u2018un-orthodox\u2019 faith may be more\nauthentic than \u2018orthodox\u2019 faith. \u2018The faith that is\nreligious\u2019, says Dewey, \u2018[I should describe as] the\nunification of the self through allegiance to inclusive ideal ends,\nwhich imagination presents to us and to which the human will responds\nas worthy of controlling our desires and choices\u2019 (1934, 33).\nAnd James: \u2018Religion says essentially two things: First, she\nsays that the best things are the more eternal things, the overlapping\nthings, the things in the universe that throw the last stone, so to\nspeak, and say the final word. ... [and] the second affirmation of\nreligion is that we are better off now if we believe her first\naffirmation to be true\u2019 (James 1896 [1956, 25\u20136]). While\nsome of what Dewey and James say about justifiable faith may appear\nnon-realist, in fact they both preserve the idea that religious faith\naspires to grasp, beyond the evidence, vital truth about reality. For\nexample, Dewey holds that religious belief grounds hope because it\ntakes something to be true about the real world \u2018which carr[ies]\none through periods of darkness and despair to such an extent that\nthey lose their usual depressive character\u2019 (1934,\n14\u20135).\n\nA general\u2014i.e., non-theologically specific\u2014account of the\nreligious kind of faith may have potential as a tool for criticising\nspecific philosophical formulations of the content of religious faith.\nThe conditions for permissible faith-venture may exclude\nfaith in God under certain inadequate conceptions of who or what God\nis. Arguably, the \u2018personal omniGod\u2019 of much contemporary\nphilosophy of religion is just such an inadequate conception (Bishop\n2007b). An understanding of what faith is, then, may motivate radical\nexplorations into the concept of God as held in the theistic\ntraditions (Bishop 1998; Johnston 2009; Bishop and Perszyk 2014,\n2023).\n\nCan there be faith of the same general kind as found in theistic\nreligious faith yet without adherence to any theistic tradition? Those\nwho agree with F. R. Tennant that \u2018faith is an outcome of the\ninborn propensity to self-conservation and self-betterment which is a\npart of human nature, and is no more a miraculously superadded\nendowment than is sensation or understanding\u2019 (1943 [1989, 111])\nwill consider that this must be a possibility. Tennant himself\nsuggests that \u2018much of the belief which underlies\nknowledge\u2019\u2014and he has scientific knowledge in\nmind\u2014\u2018is the outcome of faith which ventures beyond the\napprehension and treatment of data to supposition, imagination and\ncreation of ideal objects, and justifies its audacity and\nirrationality (in accounting them to be also real) by practical\nactualization\u2019 (1943 [1989, 100]). Faith in this sense, however,\nmay not seem quite on a par with faith of the religious kind. True,\nscientists must act as if their \u2018ideal objects\u2019\nare real in putting their theories to the empirical test; but they\nwill \u2018account them to be also real\u2019 only when these tests\ndo provide confirmation in accordance with the applicable\ninter-subjective norms.\n\nIf faith is understood as commitment beyond independent\ninter-subjective evidential support to the truth of some overall\ninterpretation of experience and reality, then all who commit\nthemselves (with sufficient steadfastness) to such a\nWeltanschauung or worldview will be people of faith. Faith of\nthis kind may be religious, and it may be religious without being\ntheistic, of course, as in classical Buddhism or Taoism. Some have\nargued that faith is a human universal: Cantwell Smith, for example,\ndescribes it as \u2018a planetary human characteristic [involving\nthe] capacity to perceive, to symbolize, and live loyally and richly\nin terms of, a transcendent dimension to [human] life\u2019 (1979,\n140\u2013141). There may also, arguably, be non-religious faith: for\nexample, \u2018scientific atheists\u2019 or\n\u2018naturalists\u2019 may be making a faith-venture when they take\nthere to be no more to reality than is in principle discoverable by\nthe natural sciences. The suggestion that atheism rests on a\nfaith-venture will, however, be resisted by those who maintain\n\u2018the presumption of atheism\u2019 (Flew, 1976): if atheism is\nrationally the default position, then adopting it requires no\nventure.\n\nAn atheist\u2019s faith-venture may, in any case, seem oddly so\ndescribed on the grounds that it provides no basis for practical hope\nor trust. Providing such a basis may plausibly be thought necessary\nfor faith\u2014the truth to which the venturer commits must be\nexistentially important in this way. (Note James\u2019s requirement\nthat faith-commitment is permissible only for resolving a\n\u2018genuine option\u2019, where a genuine option has inter\nalia to be \u2018momentous\u2019, that is, existentially\nsignificant and pressing (James 1896 [1956, 3\u20134]).) Truth-claims\naccepted by faith of the religious kind seem essentially to be\n\u2018saving\u2019 truths\u2014solutions to deep problems about the\nhuman situation. And there may thus be arguments as to which religious\ntradition offers the best solutions to human problems (see, for\nexample, Yandell 1990, 1999). J. L. Schellenberg (2009) argues that\nthe only kind of religious faith that could be justified (if any is)\nis a sceptical \u2018ultimism\u2019, in which one\n\u2018assents\u2019 to and treats as real an imaginatively grasped\nconception of a metaphysically, axiologically and soteriologically\nultimate reality.\n\nSome may nevertheless argue that an existentially vital faith that\ngrounds hope can belong within a wholly secular context\u2014that is,\nwithout counting in any recognisable sense as \u2018religious\u2019.\nCantwell Smith claims, for example, that \u2018the Graeco-Roman\nheritage \u2026 and its fecundating role in Western life [can] be\nseen as one of the major spiritual traditions of our world\u2019\n(1979, 139). Annette Baier suggests that \u2018the secular equivalent\nof faith in God, which we need in morality as well as in science or\nknowledge acquisition, is faith in the human community and its\nevolving procedures \u2013 in the prospects for many-handed cognitive\nambitions and moral hopes\u2019 (Baier 1980, 133). More broadly, some\nmaintain that a meaningful spirituality is consistent with a\nnon-religious atheist naturalism, and include something akin to faith\nas essential to spirituality. For example, Robert Solomon takes\nspirituality to mean \u2018the grand and thoughtful passions of\nlife\u2019, and holds that \u2018a life lived in accordance with\nthose passions\u2019 entails choosing to see the world as\n\u2018benign and life [as] meaningful\u2019, with the tragic not to\nbe denied but accepted (Solomon 2002, 6 & 51). (For further\ndiscussion of faith in secular contexts, see Preston-Roedder 2018,\nTsai 2017, and Ichikawa 2020; for special journal issues addressing a\nvariety of issues in the philosophy of faith in both religious and\nsecular contexts, see Rice et al. 2017; Malcolm 2023; McKaughan and\nHoward-Snyder 2023b.)\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, Robert Merrihew, 1987, \u201cThe virtue of faith\u201d,\nin <em>The Virtue of Faith and Other Essays in Philosophical\nTheology</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 9\u201324.", "Adler, Jonathan Eric, 2002, <em>Belief\u2019s Own Ethics</em>,\nCambridge MA: MIT Press.", "al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee, circa 1107 [2001], <em>Deliverance from\nError and Mystical Union with the Almighty: Al-Munquidh Min\nAl-Dal\u00e2l</em>, G.
