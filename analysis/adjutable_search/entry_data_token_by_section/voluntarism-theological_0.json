    "main_text": "Metaethical and normative theological voluntarism\n1. Metaethical and normative theological voluntarism\n\nTo be a theological voluntarist with respect to some moral status is\nto hold that entities have that status in virtue of some act of divine\nwill. But some instances of this view are metaethical theses; some\ninstances of it are normative theses.\n\nConsider, for example, theological voluntarism about the status of\nacts as obligatory or non-obligatory. One might hold that there is a\nsingle supreme obligation, the obligation to obey God. Every\nparticular type of act that one might perform thus has its moral\nstatus as obligatory or non-obligatory in virtue of God\u2019s having\ncommanded the performance of acts of that type or God\u2019s not\nhaving commanded acts of that type. This is a common version of divine\ncommand theory, according to which all of the more workaday\nobligations that we are under (not to steal from each other, not to\nmurder each other, to help each other out when it would not be\ninconvenient, etc.) bind us as a result of the exercise of God\u2019s\nsupreme practical authority.\n\nThe view just described is a version of normative theological\nvoluntarism. It is a normative view because it asserts that some\nnormative state of affairs obtains\u2014namely, the normative state\nof affairs its being obligatory to obey God. And it is a\nversion of theological voluntarism because it holds that all other\nnormative states of affairs, at least those involving obligation,\nobtain in virtue of God\u2019s commanding activity.\n\nMetaethical theological voluntarism, by contrast, does not assert the\nobtaining of any normative state of affairs. (For a contrary view, see\nHeathwood 2012, p. 7.) It is possible for one to be a metaethical\ntheological voluntarist and to hold that no normative states of\naffairs obtain. Rather, metaethical theological voluntarists aim to\nsay something interesting and informative about moral concepts,\nproperties, or states of affairs; and they want to say something\ninteresting and informative about them by connecting them to acts of\nthe divine will. Metaethical theological voluntarists might claim that\n(e.g.) obligation is a theological concept, or that the property of\nbeing obligatory is a theological property, or that obligations are\ncaused immediately by the divine will. But note that none of these\nviews asserts that there are any obligations.\n",
