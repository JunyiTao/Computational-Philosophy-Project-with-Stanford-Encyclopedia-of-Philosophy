    "main_text": "Theory of Perception\n3. Theory of Perception\n\nDemocritus\u2019 theory of perception depends on the claim that\neid\u00f4la or images, thin layers of atoms, are constantly\nsloughed off from the surfaces of macroscopic bodies and carried\nthrough the air. Later atomists cite as evidence for this the gradual\nerosion of bodies over time. These films of atoms shrink and expand;\nonly those that shrink sufficiently can enter the eye. It is the\nimpact of these on our sense organs that enables us to perceive.\nVisible properties of macroscopic objects, like their size and shape,\nare conveyed to us by these films, which tend to be distorted as they\npass through greater distances in the air, since they are subject to\nmore collisions with air atoms. A different or complementary account\nclaims that the object seen impresses the air by the\neid\u00f4la, and the compacted air thus conveys the image to\nthe eye (DK 68A135; Baldes 1975). The properties perceived by other\nsenses are also conveyed by contact of some kind. Democritus\u2019 theory\nof taste, for example, shows how different taste sensations are\nregularly produced by contact with different shapes of atoms.\n\nTheophrastus, who gives us the most thorough report of Democritus\u2019\ntheory, criticizes it for raising the expectation that the same kinds\nof atoms would always cause similar appearances. However, it may be\nthat most explanations are directed towards the normal case\nof a typical observer, and that a different account is given as to the\nperceptions of a nontypical observer, such as someone who is\nill. Democritus\u2019 account why honey sometimes tastes bitter to people\nwho are ill depends on two factors, neither of which undercut the\nnotion that certain atomic shapes regularly affect us in a given way.\nOne is that a given substance like honey is not quite homogeneous, but\ncontains atoms of different shapes. While it takes its normal\ncharacter from the predominant type of atom present, there are other\natom-types present within. The other is that our sense-organs need to\nbe suitably harmonized to admit a given atom-type, and the disposition\nof our passageways can be affected by illness or other conditions.\nThus someone who is ill may become unusually receptive to an atom-type\nthat is only a small part of honey\u2019s overall constitution.\n\nOther observed effects, however, require a theory whereby the same\natoms can produce different effects without supposing that the\nobserver has changed. The change must then occur in the object seen.\nThe explanation of color seems to be of this variety: Aristotle\nreports that things acquire their color by \u2018turning,\u2019\ntrop\u00ea (GC 1.2, 315b34). This is the\nDemocritean term that Aristotle had translated as\n\u2018position,\u2019 thesis, i.e. one of the three\nfundamental ways in which atoms can alter and thus appear differently\nto us. Aristotle gives this as the reason why color is not ascribed to\nthe atoms themselves. Lucretius\u2019 account of why color cannot belong to\natoms may help clarify the point here. We are told that if the sea\u2019s\natoms were really blue, they could not undergo some change and look\nwhite (DRN 2.774\u20135), as when we observe the sea\u2019s\nsurface changing from blue to white. This seems to assume that, while\nan appearance of a property P can be produced by something that is\nneither P nor not-P, nonetheless something P cannot appear not-P.\nSince atoms do not change their intrinsic properties, it seems that\nchange in a relational property, such as the relative position of\natoms, is most likely to be the cause of differing perceptions. In the\nshifting surface of the sea or the flutter of the pigeon with its\nirridescent neck, it is evident that the parts of the object are\nmoving and shifting in their positional relations.\n\nBy ascribing the causes of sensible qualities to relational properties\nof atoms, Democritus forfeits the prima facie plausibility of\nclaiming that things seem P because they are P. Much\nof Theophrastus\u2019 report seems to focus on the need to make it\nplausible that a composite can produce an appearance of properties it\ndoes not intrinsically possess. Democritus is flying in the face of at\nleast one strand of commonsense when he claims that textures produce\nthe appearance of hot or cold, impacts cause colour sensations. The\nlists of examples offered, drawing on commonsense associations or\nanecdotal experience, are attempts to make such claims persuasive.\nHeat is said to be caused by spherical atoms, because these move\nfreely: the commonsense association of quick movement with heating may\nbe employed here. Betegh (2020) suggests that larger void spaces are\ndirectly associated with heating, rather than that rarefaction\nindirectly causes heat by allowing freer and more frequent atomic\nmotion.\n\nAristotle sometimes criticizes Democritus for claiming that visible,\naudible, olfactory and gustatory sensations are all caused by touch\n(DK 68A119). Quite how this affects the account of perception is not\nclear, as the sources tells us little about how touch is thought to\nwork. Democritus does not, however, seem to distinguish between touch\nand contact, and may take it to be unproblematic that bodies\ncommunicate their size, shape and surface texture by physical\nimpact.\n",
