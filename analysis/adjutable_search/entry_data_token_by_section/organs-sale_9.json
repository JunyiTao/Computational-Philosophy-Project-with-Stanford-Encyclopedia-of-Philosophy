This is the distinction between cases in\nwhich altruism is obligatory (where there is a moral duty to\nhelp others) and those in which altruism is\nsupererogatory (morally good, but not morally\nrequired\u2014going \u2018above and beyond\u2019 one's duty)\n(Wilkinson 2003). This distinction is relevant for the following\nreason. If (say) altruistic kidney donation were morally obligatory,\nthen to demand money for one's organ (and, arguably, to accede to such\na demand) would be wrong. But if, on the other hand, altruistic\ndonation were supererogatory, then to demand money for one's organ\nwould not be wrong. Rather, it would be merely non-supererogatory:\nperhaps not good, but not wrong.  So, with this\ndistinction in place, one might (at least in some cases) accept that\naltruistic donations are good whilst also saying that there is nothing\nwrong with non-altruistic donation\u2014the point being that\nnon-altruistic donation, while not as good as altruistic donation, is\nnonetheless (morally) permissible. This has implications for the sort\nof altruism argument which can be made against organ sale. If it could\nbe shown that altruistic donation is obligatory then the argument\nwould be stronger, or at least more straightforward, because it would\nfollow that selling was wrong (it is wrong to demand money for what\none ought to be giving freely anyway). But if all that could be shown\nwas that altruistic donation is good, then it would not follow from\nthis, or at least it would not follow directly, that selling is\nwrong. For it might be merely non-supererogatory (Wilkinson &\nGarrard 1996).\n\n\nThis may be one area then where the differences between different\npossible organ sale systems are relevant. For it is not wildly\nimplausible to posit the existence of a duty to donate one's\norgans for posthumous transplantation. Indeed, this view is not\nconfined to utilitarian bioethicists, with even the Church of England\nstating in 2007 that (posthumous) organ donation is a Christian\nduty (BBC News Online 2007). Thus there may well be a valid\naltruism argument against a system in which people sell rights to their\nbody after death: the argument being that they should donate them\nanyway without expecting payment. This style of argument looks\nless promising, though, when looking at non-directed living kidney\ndonation (to strangers). Here, I suspect most of us want to say\nthat becoming such a donor is heroic and supererogatory, not a moral\nobligation, and so the altruism argument does not engage. Another\ninteresting example is blood (from living donors). In many\ncountries, there is a widespread view that people ought to do this\nfreely and (if this view is correct) this could underpin an altruism\nargument against paying for blood: the claim being that people ought\nnot to be paid for that which they have an obligation freely to\ngive.\n",
