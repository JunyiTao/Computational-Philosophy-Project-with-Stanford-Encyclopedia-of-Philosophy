Life and Writings\n\nG\u00e9raud (or Gerauld) de Cordemoy was born in October of 1626,\nthe son of a University of Paris professor. He was the third of four\nchildren born to G\u00e9raud and Nicole de Cordemoy, and the only\nson. His father died when he was nine years old, and other than this,\nalmost nothing is known of Cordemoy\u2019s early years. While there\nis not a record of the date of his marriage (to Marie de Chazelles),\nthe first of his five children is known to have been born on December\n7, 1651, when Cordemoy was twenty-five.\n\nCordemoy earned a living as a lawyer, but was very active in Parisian\nphilosophical circles. He attended various philosophy salons, and was\nacquainted with the Minim Emmanuel Maignan and the physicist Jacques\nRohault, both organizers of philosophical conferences. In 1664,\nCordemoy\u2019s essay Discours de l\u2019\u00e1ction des corps\n(A Discourse on the action of bodies) was included, along with a\ndiscourse by Rohault, in the posthumous publication of\nDescartes\u2019 Le Monde (The World) by Claude Clerselier.\nThat essay would later become the second of the six discourses which\nmake up one of Cordemoy\u2019s two most important works, Le\nDiscernement du corps et de l\u2019\u00e2me en six discours pour\nservir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9claircissement de la physique (The\nDistinction of the body and the soul in six discourses, in order to be\nuseful for the clarification of physics) (1666). In this work,\nCordemoy presents his atomism, his arguments for occasionalism, and\nhis accounts of the distinction of and the interaction between the\nmind and the body.\n\nCordemoy\u2019s other important work, the Discours physique de la\nparole (A Physical discourse on speech), appeared in 1668, as did\nhis Copie d\u2019une lettre ecrite \u00e0 un s\u00e7avant\nreligieux de la Compagnie de J\u00e9sus (A Copy of a letter written\nto a learned religious of the Company of Jesus). The latter is\nCordemoy\u2019s attempt to reconcile Cartesian philosophy with the\nstory of creation as found in the Book of Genesis. The former is an\naccount of speech production, and its popularity led to\nCordemoy\u2019s being recognized as one of the more important French\nphilosophers of his time. He was even the model for the character of\nthe Master of Philosophy in Moli\u00e8re\u2019s play Le\nBourgeois Gentilhomme.\n\nOther, shorter works by Cordemoy include his Traitez de\nMetaphysique (Treatise on Metaphysics) and his Traitez sur\nl\u2019Histoire et la Politique (Treatise on History and\nPolitics). At the time of his death, Cordemoy was working on a\nhistory of France, which would be completed by his eldest son\nLouis-G\u00e9raud and which appeared in two volumes, in 1685 and\n1689. In addition to his philosophical and historical publications,\nCordemoy served briefly as the director of l\u2019Academie\nFran\u00e7ais (having been elected a member in 1675) and was\nfor a time the tutor to the Dauphin, son of King Louis XIV. Shortly\nafter his 58th birthday, Cordemoy suffered a brief illness\nand died, on October 15, 1684.\n2. Atomism\n\nDescartes had held that the essence of body is extension, and that as\na result matter can be divided without end. If it is the nature of a\nbody to take up space in three dimensions, that is, to have width,\nlength, and height, then we can always conceive of that width, length,\nor height being divided. Further, according to Cartesian metaphysics,\nextension is the principle attribute of body, and as such cannot exist\nindependently of body (nor can body exist independently of it). Thus\naccording to Descartes, anywhere there is extended space, there is\nbody occupying that space, making the existence of a void impossible.\nAnd so it is surprising to find Cordemoy, whose metaphysics is in most\nother respects quite Cartesian, arguing at the beginning of the\nDiscernement for the existence of both indivisible atoms and\nempty space.\n\nThe First Discourse of the Discernement opens with five\nclaims about bodies which lay the ground for Cordemoy\u2019s physics\n(which he goes on to discuss in Discourses Two and Three). He tells us\nthat bodies are: (1) limited in their extension, and this limit is\ncalled the \u2018figure\u2019 of the body; (2) inasmuch as each body\nis a substance, bodies are not divisible into smaller bodies, nor are\nbodies penetrable by other bodies; (3) the relation a body has to\nother bodies is called its \u2018place\u2019; (4) a change in this\nrelation is the motion of the body; and (5) when the relation\ncontinues unchanged, the body is at rest. Cordemoy then declares that\nmatter is clearly and distinctly understood as an assembly of bodies.\nProperly considered, bodies are parts of matter, and depending how\nthese bodies are related to each other determines what sort of portion\nof matter the collection is: if they are very near each other, it is a\nheap (un tas); if they are \u201cchanging their position\nincessantly\u201d (1968, 96), it is a fluid (une liqueur);\nand if the bodies are not moving and cannot be separated from each\nother, it is a mass (une masse).\n\nWhile not stated explicitly, Cordemoy\u2019s reason for accepting\natomism seems to be based on his understanding of the concept of\nsubstance. Following Descartes, Cordemoy takes substance to be that\nwhich requires nothing else for its existence. Strictly speaking, this\nwould make God the only substance, but in the created world, Descartes\nheld that we may consider minds and body to be substances in a\nqualified sense. Each of these substances has a principle attribute\ndistinguishable from it only by reason. It is this attribute through\nwhich we conceive the substance, and it is that to which all of the\nsubstance\u2019s other properties are referred. For minds this\nattribute is thought, and for body it is, as mentioned above,\nextension.\n\nWith regard to body, Cordemoy warns that we must be careful to avoid\nthe mistake made by other Cartesians, who have conflated what are in\nfact two distinct things, namely, \u2018bodies\u2019 and\n\u2018matter\u2019. The former are, according to Cordemoy, the true\nextended substances, while the latter are assemblages, or\ncollections, of the former. The key point is that as substances,\nbodies must be simple: if bodies had parts, they would depend on those\nparts to be what they are, and in this way the parts would threaten a\nbody\u2019s very status as a substance. Thus we are led to atomism on\nstrictly a priori grounds: in positing bodies as substances, we are\nprecluded from attributing parts to them, for if we did, they would no\nlonger be substances. Matter on this account is divisible not because\nits nature is extension and any extension can always be divided, but\nrather because it is composed of bodies which can be separated from\neach other, though each one is itself indivisible.\n\nThe reason for this confusion between body and matter is due, says\nCordemoy, to an over-reliance on the senses: \u201cwe have a very\nclear idea of body, and as we know that they are extended substances,\nwithout thinking clearly we join this notion which we have of body to\nthat which we have of matter. Taking a mass for a body, we consider it\nas a substance, believing that all that we see is only the same\nextension. And because all that we see as extended is divisible, we\nthus join the notion of that which is extended to the notion of that\nwhich is divisible, such that we believe divisible all that is\nextended\u201d (1968, 97). The bodies being too small to be\nperceived, we can be misled into thinking that a collection of bodies,\nthat is, matter, is the true extended substance, and from\nmatter\u2019s divisibility wrongly conclude that material substance\ncan therefore be divided.\n\nCordemoy also maintains the possibility of a void, that is, space\nwhich is truly empty, and as before, his argument is based on his\nunderstanding of the concept of substance. If we have three contiguous\nbodies and the one in the middle is destroyed in an instant, we will,\nCordemoy claims, be left with an empty space between the two remaining\nbodies (that is, the two would not instantaneously rush together).\nThese two bodies, being substances, possess a metaphysical\nindependence from what happens to other bodies. For Cordemoy, to hold\notherwise would disqualify bodies (atoms) from being substances, on\nhis understanding of the concept of substance. Likewise, if one could\nremove all of the matter filling a vase, the sides of the vase,\npace Descartes and others, would not collapse, according to\nCordemoy. The bodies that compose the sides are each themselves\nsubstances, and as such are ontologically independent of what happens\nto other bodies (for again, if they were not, they would not qualify\nas a substance).\n\nCordemoy concludes the First Discourse with a discussion of three\ninconveniens, problems with which Descartes\u2019 plenum\ntheory must deal but which Cordemoy\u2019s atomism escapes. The first\ninvolves a distinction between two concepts, \u2018indefinite\u2019\nand \u2018infinite\u2019, which Cordemoy claims amount to the same\nthing: \u201cWhen I ask [the Cartesians] if this substance, which\nthey believe to be divisible, is divisible to infinity, as it seems to\nme their supposition would give them to understand, they respond that\nit is not, but that it is divisible indefinitely. When I begged them\nto explain this indefinite division to me, I was led to understand it\nin the same way that the whole world understands the infinite\u201d\n(1968, 99). Descartes was (usually) careful to distinguish between\nthat to which we cannot see or comprehend an end, which he termed\n\u2018indefinite\u2019, and that which we know in a positive way to\nbe without limit, which he termed \u2018infinite\u2019. The\ndivisibility of matter is for Descartes indefinite, while only God can\nproperly be said to be infinite. Cordemoy\u2019s complaint is that if\n\u2018indefinite\u2019 and \u2018infinite\u2019 really amount to\nthe same thing\u2014and he thinks according to the Cartesians\u2019\nown account they do\u2014then \u201cthere is something\ninconceivable\u201d (ibid.) in claiming that bodies are\ndivisible ad infinitum, since this would threaten their\nstatus as substances. (Clearly, though, this objection goes through\nonly given a prior acceptance of Cordemoy\u2019s atomism.)\n\nThe second and third inconveniens both deal with Descartes\ntheory of the individuation of physical bodies. For Descartes, bodies\nare individuated in terms of motion: an individual body is that\nportion of matter which moves together, that is, which changes place\nwith respect to the bodies which are its neighbors. Cordemoy\u2019s\nfirst question is how, on this account, can we individuate a body at\nrest: \u201cAccording to their doctrine, we cannot conceive of a body\nat rest between other bodies, because supposing that it is touching\nthem, this doctrine teaches that together with them it makes only one\nbody. Yet it seems to me that we have a very clear and very natural\nidea of a body perfectly at rest between other bodies, where nothing\nis in motion, and what I say of each body accords perfectly well with\nthis idea\u201d (1968, 99). It is, then, our clear conception of a\nbody at rest between other bodies but at the same time distinct from\nthem which signals trouble for the Cartesians theory. Cordemoy, on the\nother hand, faces no such problem, since for him the only\ntrue physical individuals are bodies/atoms; all other\n\u2018bodies\u2019 are rightly called matter, and are individuals\nonly in a loose sense of the word.\n\nThe third problem raised by Cordemoy concerns a body which has its\ndifferent parts in motion in different directions, such as a tree and\nits branches being blown in the wind. According to Descartes\u2019\nown definition of a physical individual, we would seem to have a\nproblem, since the different parts are changing differently with\nrespect to the other individuals which would be considered its\nneighbors. In such cases, it would seem to \u201cfollow that when\nneighboring bodies push it in different spots along opposing lines,\nthey will divide it in as many ways as it is pushed\u201d\n(ibid.). As with the second complaint, this violates the\nclear idea we have of the object as one thing. And as before, Cordemoy\nnotes that no such problem arises for his atomism.\n\nCordemoy was, as mentioned previously, alone among Descartes\u2019\nfollowers in his acceptance of atomism. One of his harshest critics\nwas his fellow Cartesian Dom Robert Desgabets, who accused Cordemoy of\ngiving ammunition to the enemies of Descartes, namely the Gassendists,\nthemselves atomists. Desgabets had been sent a copy of the\nDiscernement by Clerselier, and quickly responded to it with\nhis Lettre \u00e9crite a M. Clerselier touchant les nouveaux\nraisonnements pour les atomes et le vide contenus dans le livre du\ndiscernement du corps et de l\u2019\u00e2me (A Letter written to M.\nClerselier concerning the new arguments for atoms and the void\ncontained in the book on the distinction of the body and the\nsoul). In addition to his accusation of betraying the true\nphilosophy, Desgabets defends the intelligibility of the\nindefinite/infinite distinction and offers several criticisms of\nCordemoy\u2019s position. He notes that in Cartesian terms, as\ndistance is a mode, it can only exist as a mode of a substance. Thus\nwherever we have a distance, it must be a distance of\nsomething, and as distance is expressed quantitatively, that\nsomething can always be divided, even if only by God. The same line of\nthinking shows the impossibility of the void: if it is claimed that\nbetween two points there is only empty space, there is nothing there\nwhich could posses any properties, including length. So of what is the\nlength between the two points a property? Cordemoy did not respond to\nDesgabets in print, but the Benedictine would seem to have raised some\nimportant questions for anyone holding atomism grounded upon a\nCartesian metaphysics.\n3. Occasionalism\n\nCordemoy was one of the first, if not the first, to argue that\nCartesian metaphysics leads to occasionalism, the doctrine that God is\nthe one true cause active in the world. (Louis de La Forge\u2019s\nTrait\u00e9 de l\u2019esprit de l\u2019homme et de ses\nfacultez et fonctions, et de son union avec le corps (Treatise on the\nmind of man and its faculties and functions, and on its union with the\nbody), which also argued for occasionalism on Cartesian grounds,\nappeared just months before the Discernement, though Cordemoy\nclaims to have accepted occasionalism as early as 1658 (1968, 145). It\nis unlikely that either Cordemoy or de La Forge influenced the\nother.)\n\nCordemoy\u2019s argument for occasionalism with regard to body-body\ninteraction appears in the Fourth Discourse of the\nDiscernement (he will later expand his occasionalism to cover\nall \u2018interaction\u2019 in the created world). There we are\ngiven a series of definitions and axioms, and conclusions derived from\nthese. Cordemoy begins by asserting as axioms (1) a thing does not\nhave of itself (de soy) that which can be lost without\nceasing to be what it is, and (2) bodies are able to lose their motion\nwithout ceasing to be bodies. The conclusion drawn is that bodies do\nnot have motion of themselves (that is, they do not possess the\nproperty of motion essentially), since they continue to be bodies when\nnot in motion. Nor can one body give motion to another. This is not\nstated as one of Cordemoy\u2019s axioms, but rather follows from\nCartesian metaphysics, which holds motion to be a mode or state of a\nbody, and not a quality distinct from the body. As such, a\nmode\u2014that is, the very same mode\u2014cannot be transferred\nfrom one body to another.\n\nAs for the first mover, it could not itself be a body, since if it\nwere, it would have to have motion of itself (for as first mover,\nwhere else would it get it?), and this has been shown to be impossible\nfor bodies. Thus we may also conclude that the first mover is not a\nbody. But there being only two kinds of substances (Cordemoy\u2019s\nthird axiom), bodies and minds, only a mind remains as a candidate for\nthe first mover. Further, it is clear that our (finite) minds are not\nthe source of motion in bodies. In the first place, our minds cannot\neffect our bodies in certain ways, either because they are immune to\nsuch influence (e.g., I cannot will the cells in my liver to cease\ndividing) or because of old age or injury (e.g., a crippled man cannot\nwill himself to walk). Second\u2014and noteworthy in that it\nanticipates both Malebranche and Hume\u2014if we restrict ourselves\nto what we observe, we never experience a causal connection but only\ntemporal succession between our volitions at one moment and our\nbody\u2019s actions the next. Third, if we could produce motion in\nbodies at will, it would, says Cordemoy, upset God\u2019s plan for\nthe quantity of motion which God conserves in the world. Thus he\nconcludes that an infinite will must be the first mover.\n\nIt is Cordemoy\u2019s fourth and fifth axioms which, together with\nthis conclusion, get us occasionalism. The fourth axiom states that to\nmove is an action, and the fifth claims that an action can only be\ncontinued by the agent which initiated it. Therefore, the mind which\ninitiates the motion of bodies, God, is the same agent who continues\ntheir motion in the present. As with those who fail to distinguish\nbodies from matter, the fault of those who posit finite causes are\nguilty of making an unsupported inference from their sense experience.\nMaking a point that Malebranche and Hume would later echo, Cordemoy\nsays: \u201cWhen we say, for example, that body B drives body A away\nfrom its place, if we examine well what is acknowledged for certain in\nthis case, we will only see that body B was moved, that it encountered\nC, which was at rest, and that since this encounter, the first ceased\nto be moved [and] the second commenced to be moved. But if we\nrecognize that B gave some of its motion to C, that is truly only a\nprejudice which comes from what we do not see.\u201d In good\nCartesian spirit, Cordemoy is claiming that it is reason which points\nout the way the world must be, and that uncritical acceptance of the\ndeliverances of the senses will only lead to error.\n4. The Mind and the Body\n\nLike Descartes\u2019 Meditations, the Discernement\ncontains six sections, and also like the Meditations, it\nconcludes with discussions of the union of and the distinction between\nthe mind and the body (though while Cordemoy addresses them in this\norder, Descartes, in the 6th Meditation, first tackles the\ndistinction, and later the nature of the union). But unlike Descartes,\nwho had gone to some length to argue that the nature of the mind is to\nthink, Cordemoy\u2019s Fifth Discourse accepts this as a given.\nFurther, Cordemoy does not provide an argument that the mind and body\nform a substantial union, but gives an example to show that they are\nunited, that of the body moving when the mind wills that it do so. In\nfact, the union is defined in terms of this sort of\ninteraction: to say that the mind and body are united simply is to say\nthat they interact. (Thus the question of whether the problem of the\nmind-body union is distinct from that of mind-body interaction, which\nhas been much discussed in Descartes scholarship, does not arise for\nCordemoy.) The Fifth Discourse also contains Cordemoy\u2019s\nexpansion of his occasionalism to cover interaction between the mind\nand the body. God\u2019s activity is required here on the grounds\nthat as the union is defined in terms of the interaction of\nessentially distinct substances with mutually exclusive essences, we\nmust go outside that union to account for the ability of one substance\nto effect change in the other.\n\nThe final of the six discourses which make up the\nDiscernement addresses the question of the distinction\nbetween the mind and the body, as well as an argument that the\nexistence of the mind is better known than the existence of the body\n(but note: not that the nature of the former is better known\nthan the nature of the latter, as Descartes had claimed) and\na glossary of the affects of the mind, the body, and the mind-body\nunion. Cordemoy\u2019s first argument for the distinction begins by\nlisting a number of features of bodies, and contrasts this with a list\nof features of minds. Seeing that what is most fundamental to body is\nabsent from the list of properties of the mind, and vice versa, he\nconcludes that we thus \u201chave reason to judge that they are two\ncompletely different things\u201d (1968, 153).\n\nCordemoy employs a second argument for the distinction, one which,\nwhile much less rigorous than Descartes\u2019, follows in spirit the\nargument from the Discourse on Method by appealing to doubt:\n\u201cI even see that when I wish to doubt everything that I know\nwhen I think of bodies, I am not able at the same time to doubt my\nthought. For let it be false, if you will, that there are any bodies\nin the world; it cannot be that there are no thoughts, inasmuch as I\nwould be thinking. How could I believe that my thought might be the\nsame thing that I call \u2018body\u2019? I can suppose that there\naren\u2019t any bodies, and I cannot suppose that I do not think, the\nsupposition itself being a thought. Thus I know firstly that the soul,\nor that which thinks, is different from the body\u201d (1968, 153).\nCordemoy goes on to argue along similar lines that he can be assured\nof the existence of his mind, but that the existence of his body, and\nall other bodies, must be taken as an article of faith.\n5. Language and Speech\n\nThough it is in the Discernement that we find the basics of\nCordemoy\u2019s philosophy, it was his Discours physique de la\nparole which was most identified with him. (Unlike the\nDiscernement, the Discours was translated into\nEnglish during Cordemoy\u2019s lifetime.) The Discours opens\nwith the question of other minds: while I know that I am a thinking\nthing, how can I be certain that other humans are\u2014might not they\nbe mindless automata who only behave as if there were clever\nthoughts behind their behavior? Following Descartes, Cordemoy claims\nthat it is other humans\u2019 use of language\u2014both in its\ncomplexity and its creativity\u2014which assures me that they have\nminds, in that such communication cannot be explained on mechanical\nprinciples alone. Cordemoy then concludes this discussion, saying:\n\u201cNow that it is no longer possible for me to doubt that the\nbodies which resemble mine are united to souls, and since I am sure\nthat there are other men than me, I think that I ought to look with\ncare at what remains to be known about speech\u201d (1968, 209). The\nremainder of the Discours is taken up with this\ninvestigation.\n\n\u2018True\u2019 language use, as opposed to the mere production of\nsound, is according to Cordemoy a matter of \u201cgiving signs to\none\u2019s thoughts\u201d (1968 196). Language is on his account an\nartificial system of signs, the purpose of which is to communicate our\nthoughts, the words standing as their representatives, to one another.\nIt is the creative aspect of language which demands the presence of a\nrational soul. True speech requires two things, says Cordemoy:\n\u201cthe formation of the voice, which can only come from the body,\nand the signification or idea that is joined with it, which can only\ncome from the soul\u201d (1968, 198). Yet while there is a need for a\nsoul in order to engage in what would rightly be called genuine\nlanguage use, the ability to make sounds can be explained on entirely\nmechanistic grounds (the explanation being for Cordemoy very similar\nto how musical instruments produce sound). In this way sound\nproduction is like nutrition, circulation, and respiration, none of\nwhich, as Descartes had also believed, require a soul, but which\nresult instead from a proper disposition of one\u2019s organs. As for\nanimals such as parrots which not only make sounds, but utter words,\nCordemoy claims that \u2018returning words\u2019 is not a sign of a\nsoul in such creatures, any more than a canyon\u2019s echo requires\nrocks to have souls.
