    "main_text": "Philosophical foundations for analogical reasoning || Pragmatic justification\n4.4 Pragmatic justification\n\nArguably, the most promising available defense of analogical reasoning\nmay be found in its application to case law (see\n Precedent and Analogy in Legal Reasoning).\n Judicial decisions are based on the verdicts and reasoning that have\ngoverned relevantly similar cases, according to the doctrine of\nstare decisis (Levi 1949; Llewellyn 1960; Cross and Harris\n1991; Sunstein 1993). Individual decisions by a court are\nbinding on that court and lower courts; judges are obligated\nto decide future cases \u2018in the same way.\u2019 That is, the\nreasoning applied in an individual decision, referred to as the\nratio decidendi, must be applied to similar future cases (see\n Example 10).\n In practice, of course, the situation is extremely complex. No two\ncases are identical. The ratio must be understood in the\ncontext of the facts of the original case, and there is considerable\nroom for debate about its generality and its applicability to future\ncases. If a consensus emerges that a past case was wrongly decided,\nlater judgments will distinguish it from new cases,\neffectively restricting the scope of the ratio to the\noriginal case.\n\nThe practice of following precedent can be justified by two main\npractical considerations. First, and above all, the practice is\nconservative: it provides a relatively stable basis for\nreplicable decisions. People need to be able to predict the actions of\nthe courts and formulate plans accordingly. Stare decisis\nserves as a check against arbitrary judicial decisions. Second, the\npractice is still reasonably progressive: it allows for the\ngradual evolution of the law. Careful judges distinguish bad\ndecisions; new values and a new consensus can emerge in a series of\ndecisions over time.\n\nIn theory, then, stare decisis strikes a healthy balance\nbetween conservative and progressive social values. This justification\nis pragmatic. It pre-supposes a common set of social values, and links\nthe use of analogical reasoning to optimal promotion of those values.\nNotice also that justification occurs at the level of the practice in\ngeneral; individual analogical arguments sometimes go astray. A full\nexamination of the nature and foundations for stare decisis\nis beyond the scope of this entry, but it is worth asking the\nquestion: might it be possible to generalize the justification for\nstare decisis? Is a parallel pragmatic justification\navailable for analogical arguments in general?\n\nBartha (2010) offers a preliminary attempt to provide such a\njustification by shifting from social values to epistemic values. The\ngeneral idea is that reasoning by analogy is especially well suited to\nthe attainment of a common set of epistemic goals or values. In simple\nterms, analogical reasoning\u2014when it conforms to certain\ncriteria\u2014achieves an excellent (perhaps optimal) balance between\nthe competing demands of stability and innovation. It supports both\nconservative epistemic values, such as simplicity and coherence with\nexisting belief, and progressive epistemic values, such as\nfruitfulness and theoretical unification (McMullin (1993) provides a\nclassic list).\n",
