    "main_text": "Failure of Epistemic Transmission || Varieties of Non-Transmissive Arguments\n3.2 Varieties of Non-Transmissive Arguments\n\nSome non-transmissive arguments explicitly feature their\nconclusion among their premises. Suppose \\(p\\) is justified for \\(s\\)\nby \\(e\\), and consider the premise-circular argument that deduces\n\\(p\\) from itself. This argument cannot satisfy\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n even if\n (C1)\n and\n (C2)\n are satisfied. The reason is that no part of \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification for \\(p\\) can be acquired in virtue of, among\nother things, the satisfaction of\n (C2).\n For if\n (C1)\n is satisfied, \\(p\\) is justified for \\(s\\) by \\(e\\)\nindependently of \\(s\\)\u2019s knowledge of \\(p\\)\u2019s\nself-entailment, thus not in virtue of\n (C2).\n\nNon-transmissive arguments are not necessarily premise-circular. A\ndifferent source of non-transmissivity instantiating a subtler form of\ncircularity is the dependence of evidential relations on background or\ncollateral information. This type of dependence is a rather familiar\nphenomenon: the boiling of a kettle gives one justification for\nbelieving that the temperature of the liquid inside is approximately\n100\u00b0C only if one knows that the liquid is water and that\natmospheric pressure is the one of the sea-level. It doesn\u2019t if\none knows that the kettle is on the top of a high mountain, or the\nliquid is, say, sulfuric acid.\n\nWright argues, for instance, that the following epistemic set-up,\nwhich he calls the information-dependence template, suffices\nfor an argument\u2019s inability to transmit justification.\n\n\nA body of evidence, \\(e\\), is an information-dependent justification\nfor a particular proposition \\(p\\) if whether \\(e\\) justifies \\(p\\)\ndepends on what one has by way of collateral information, \\(i\\).\n[\u2026] Such a relationship is always liable to generate examples\nof transmission failure: it will do so just when the particular \\(e,\np\\), and \\(i\\) have the feature that needed elements of the relevant\n\\(i\\) are themselves entailed by \\(p\\) (together perhaps with other\nwarranted premises). In that case, any warrant supplied by \\(e\\) for\n\\(p\\) will not be transmissible to those elements of \\(i\\). (Wright\n2003: 59, edited.)\n\n\nThe claim that \\(s\\)\u2019s justification from \\(e\\) for \\(p\\)\nrequires \\(s\\) to have background information \\(i\\) is customarily\nunderstood as equivalent (in this context) to the claim that\n\\(s\\)\u2019s justification from \\(e\\) for \\(p\\) depends on some type\nof independent justification for believing or accepting\n \\(i\\).[5]\n\nInstantiating the information-dependence template appears\nsufficient for an argument\u2019s inability to transmit\nfirst-time justification. Consider again this triad:\n\nTwins\n\n\\(\\rE_2\\). \nThis girl looks just like Jessica.\n\\(\\rP_2\\).\n This girl is actually Jessica.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_2\\).\n This girl is not Jocelyn.\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(s\\)\u2019s background information entails that Jessica and\nJocelyn are indistinguishable twins. Imagine that \\(s\\) acquires\n \\(\\rE_2\\).\n It is intuitive that \\(\\rE_2\\) could justify\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n for \\(s\\) only if \\(s\\) had independent justification for\nbelieving\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\n in the first instance. Thus, Twins instantiates the\ninformation-dependence template. Note that \\(s\\) acquires\nfirst-time justification for \\(\\rQ_2\\) in Twins only if \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n\n\\(\\rE_2\\)\n gives her justification for\n \\(\\rP_2\\),\n \n\n\n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n \\(s\\) knows that\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\n and\n\n\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n \\(s\\) acquires first-time justification for believing\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\nin virtue of\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n and\n (C2\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\)).\n \n\n\nThe satisfaction of\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n requires \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for believing\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\nnot to be independent of \\(s\\)\u2019s justification from\n \\(\\rE_2\\)\n for\n \\(\\rP_2\\).\n However, if\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n is true, the informational-dependence template requires\n\\(s\\) to have justification for believing \\(\\rQ_2\\)\nindependently of \\(s\\)\u2019s justification from \\(\\rE_2\\)\nfor \\(\\rP_2\\). Thus, when the information-dependence template\nis instantiated,\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n and (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Twins}}\\)) cannot be satisfied at\nonce. In general, no argument satisfying this template together with a\ngiven evidence will be transmissive of first-time justification based\non that evidence.\n\nOne may wonder whether a deductive argument from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\)\ninstantiating the information-dependence template is unable\nto transmit additional justification for \\(q\\). The answer\nseems affirmative when the additional justification is\nindependent justification. Suppose the\ninformation-dependence template is instantiated such that\n\\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(p\\) from \\(e\\) depends on\n\\(s\\)\u2019s independent justification for \\(q\\). Note that \\(s\\)\nacquires additional independent justification for \\(q\\) only if \n\n(C1)\n \\(e\\) gives her justification for \\(p\\), \n(C2)\n \\(s\\) knows that \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\), and \n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{ai}}\\))\n \\(s\\) acquires an additional independent justification in virtue\nof (C1) and (C2).\n\n\nThis additional justification is independent of \\(s\\)\u2019s\nantecedent justification for \\(q\\) only if, in particular, condition\n (IN3)\n of the characterization of additional independent justification is\nsatisfied. (IN3) says that if \\(s\\) had not been antecedently\njustified in believing \\(q\\), upon learning \\(e, s\\) would have\nacquired via transmission a first-time justification for believing\n\\(q\\). (IN3) entails that if \\(q\\) were not antecedently justified for\n\\(s, e\\) would still justify \\(p\\) for \\(s\\). Hence, the satisfaction\nof (IN3) is incompatible with the instantiation of the\ninformation-dependence template, which entails that if \\(s\\)\nhad not antecedent justification for \\(q, e\\) would not\njustify \\(p\\) for \\(s\\). The instantiation of the\ninformation-dependence template then precludes transmission\nof independent justification.\n\nAs suggested by Wright (2007), the instantiation of the\ninformation-dependence template might also appear sufficient\nfor an argument\u2019s inability to transmit additional\nquantitatively strengthening justification. This claim might\nappear intuitively plausible: perhaps it is reasonable that if the\njustification from \\(e\\) for \\(p\\) depends on independent\njustification for another proposition \\(q\\), the strength of the\njustification available for \\(q\\) sets an upper bound to the strength\nof the justification possibly supplied by \\(e\\) for \\(p\\). However,\nthe examples by Wright (2011) and Moretti & Piazza (2013)\nmentioned in\n Sect. 2\n appear to undermine this intuition. For they involve arguments that\ninstantiate the information-dependent template yet seem to\ntransmit quantitatively strengthening justification to their\nconclusions. (Alspector-Kelly 2015 suggests that these arguments are a\nsymptom that Wright\u2019s explanation of non-transmissivity is\noverall inadequate.) \n\nSome authors have attempted Bayesian formalizations of the\ninformation dependence template (see the supplement on\n Bayesian Formalizations of the Information-Dependence Template.)\n Furthermore, Coliva (2012) has proposed a variant of the same\ntemplate. In accordance with the information-dependence\ntemplate, \\(s\\)\u2019s justification from \\(e\\) for \\(p\\) fails\nto transmit to \\(p\\)\u2019s consequence \\(q\\) whenever \\(s\\)\u2019s\npossessing that justification for \\(p\\) requires \\(s\\)\u2019s\nindependent justification for \\(q\\). According to Coliva\u2019s\nvariant, \\(s\\)\u2019s justification from \\(e\\) for \\(p\\) fails to\ntransmit to \\(q\\) whenever \\(s\\)\u2019s possessing the latter\njustification for \\(p\\) requires \\(s\\)\u2019s independent\nassumption of \\(q\\), whether this assumption is justified\nor not. Pryor (2012: \u00a7 VII) can be read as pressing\nobjections against Coliva\u2019s template, which are addressed in\nColiva (2012).\n\nWe have seen that non-transmissivity may depend on premise-circularity\nor reliance on collateral information. There is at least a third\npossibility: an argument can be non-transmissive of the justification\nfor its premise(s) based on given evidence because the evidence\njustifies directly the conclusion\u2014i.e.,\nindependently of the argument itself (cf. Davies 2009). In\nthis case the argument instantiates indirectness, for\n\\(s\\)\u2019s going through the argument would result in nothing but\nan indirect (and unneeded) detour for justifying its conclusion. If\n\\(e\\) directly justifies \\(q\\), no part of the justification for \\(q\\)\nis based on, among other things, \\(s\\)\u2019s knowledge of the\ninferential relation between \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). So\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n is unfulfilled whether or not\n (C1)\n and\n (C2)\n are fulfilled. Here is an example from Wright (2002):\n\nSoccer\n\n\\(\\rE_6\\).\n Jones has just kicked the ball between the white posts.\n\\(\\rP_6\\).\n Jones has just scored a goal.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_6\\).\n A game of soccer is taking place.\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(s\\) learns evidence\n \\(\\rE_6\\).\n On ordinary background information, \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\))\n\n\\(\\rE_6\\)\n justifies\n \\(\\rP_6\\)\n for \\(s\\), \n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\))\n \\(s\\) knows that\n \\(\\rP_6\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_6\\),\n and\n \\(\\rE_6\\)\n also justifies\n \\(\\rQ_6\\)\n for \\(s\\).\n\n\nIt seems false, however, that\n \\(\\rQ_6\\)\n is justified for \\(s\\) in virtue of the satisfaction of\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\))\n and\n (C2\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\)).\n Quite the reverse, \\(\\rQ_6\\) seems justified for \\(s\\) by\n \\(\\rE_6\\)\n independently the satisfaction of (C1\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\)) and\n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\)). This is so because in the (imagined) actual\nscenario it seems true that \\(s\\) would still possess a justification\nfor \\(\\rQ_6\\) based on \\(\\rE_6\\) even if \\(\\rE_6\\) did not\njustify\n \\(\\rP_6\\)\n for \\(s\\). In fact suppose \\(s\\) had noticed that the referee\u2019s\nassistant raised her flag to signal Jones\u2019s off-side. Against\nthis altered background information, \\(\\rE_6\\) would no longer justify\n\\(\\rP_6\\) for \\(s\\) but it would still justify \\(\\rQ_6\\) for \\(s\\).\nThus, Soccer is non-transmissive of the justification\ndepending on \\(\\rE_6\\). In general, no argument instantiating\nindirectness in relation to some evidence is transmissive of\njustification based on that evidence.\n\nThe information-dependence template and indirectness\nare diagnostics for a deductive argument\u2019s inability to transmit\nthe justification for its premise(s) \\(p\\) based on evidence \\(e\\) to\nits conclusion \\(q\\), where \\(e\\) is conceived of as a\nbelieved proposition capable of supplying\ninferential and (typically) fallible justification\nfor \\(p\\). (Note that even though \\(e\\) is conceived of as a belief,\nthe collateral information \\(i\\), which is part of the\ntemplate, doesn\u2019t need to be believed on some views.)\nThe justification for a proposition \\(p\\) might come in other forms.\nFor instance, it has been proposed that a proposition \\(p\\) about the\nperceivable environment around the subject \\(s\\) can be justified by\nthe fact that \\(s\\) sees that \\(p\\) (where\n\u2018sees\u2019 is taken to be factive). In this case,\n\\(s\\) is claimed to attain a kind of non-inferential and\ninfallible justification for believing \\(p\\). This view has\nbeen explored by epistemological disjunctivists (see for\ninstance McDowell 1982, 1994 and 2008, and Pritchard 2007, 2008, 2009,\n2011 and 2012a).\n\nOne might find it intuitively plausible that when \\(s\\) sees that \\(p,\ns\\) attains non-inferential and infallible justification for believing\n\\(p\\) that doesn\u2019t rely on \\(s\\)\u2019s background information.\nSince this justification for believing \\(p\\) would be a\nfortiori unconstrained by \\(s\\)\u2019s independent justification\nfor believing any consequence \\(q\\) of \\(p\\), in these cases the\ninformation-dependence template could not possibly be instantiated.\nTherefore, one might be tempted to conclude that when \\(s\\) sees that\n\\(p, s\\) acquires a justification that typically transmits to the\npropositions that \\(s\\) knows to be deducible from \\(p\\) (cf. Wright\n2002). Pritchard (2009, 2012a) comes very close to endorsing this view\nexplicitly.\n\nThe latter contention has not stayed unchallenged. Suppose one accepts\na notion of epistemic justification with internalist\nresonances saying that a factor \\(J\\) is relevant to \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification only if \\(s\\) is able to determine, by reflection alone,\nwhether \\(J\\) is or is not realized. On this notion, \\(s\\)\u2019s\nseeing that \\(p\\) cannot provide \\(s\\) with justification for\nbelieving \\(p\\) unless \\(s\\) can rationally claim that she is\nseeing that \\(p\\) upon reflection alone. Seeing that \\(p\\),\nhowever, is subjectively indistinguishable from hallucinating\nthat \\(p\\), or from being in some other delusional state in which it\nmerely seems to \\(s\\) that she is seeing that \\(p\\). Hence,\none may find it compelling that \\(s\\) can claim by reflection alone\nthat she\u2019s seeing that \\(p\\) only if \\(s\\) has an independent\nreason for ruling out that it merely seems to her that she does (cf.\nWright 2011). If this is true, for many deductive arguments from \\(p\\)\nto \\(q, s\\) won\u2019t be able to acquire non-inferential and\ninfallible justification for believing \\(p\\) of the type described by\nthe disjunctivist and transmit it to \\(q\\). This will happen whenever\n\\(q\\) is the logical negation of a proposition ascribing to \\(s\\) some\ndelusionary mental state in which it merely seems to her that she\ndirectly perceives that \\(p\\).\n\nWright\u2019s disjunctive template is meant to be a\ndiagnostic of transmission failure of non-inferential justification\nwhen epistemic justification is conceived of in the internalist\nfashion suggested\n above.[6]\n According to Wright (2000), for any propositions \\(p, q\\) and \\(r\\)\nand subject \\(s\\), the disjunctive template is instantiated\nwhenever: \n\n(D1)\n \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\);\n(D2)\n \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(p\\) consists in \\(s\\)\u2019s\nbeing in a state subjectively indistinguishable from a state in which\n\\(r\\) would be true;\n(D3)\n \\(r\\) is incompatible with \\(p\\);\n(D4)\n \\(r\\) would be true if \\(q\\) were false.\n\n\nTo see how this template works, consider again the following\ntriad:\n\nZebra\n\n\\(\\rE_3\\).\n The animals in the pen look like zebras.\n\\(\\rP_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are zebras.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are not mules cleverly disguised to look\nlike zebras.\n\n\n\nThe justification from\n \\(\\rE_3\\)\n for\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n arguably fails to transmit across the inference from \\(\\rP_3\\) to\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n because of the satisfaction of the information-dependence\ntemplate. For it seems true that \\(s\\) could acquire a\njustification for believing \\(\\rP_3\\) on the basis of \\(\\rE_3\\) only\nif \\(s\\) had an independent justification for believing \\(\\rQ_3\\). Now\nsuppose that \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(\\rP_3\\) is based on,\nnot \\(\\rE_3\\) but \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_3\\).\nLet\u2019s call Zebra* the corresponding variant of\nZebra. Given the non-inferential nature of the\njustification considered for \\(\\rP_3\\), Zebra* could not\ninstantiate the information-dependence template. However, it\nis easy to check that Zebra* instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate. To begin with, \n\n(D1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n\n\\(\\rP_3\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_3\\);\n \n(D2\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n is constituted by \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_3\\), which is\nsubjectively indistinguishable from the state that \\(s\\) would be in\nif it were true that\n\n\n\\(\\rR_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\).\n the animals in the pen are mules cleverly disguised to look like\nzebras; \n\n(D3\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n\\(\\rR_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)\n is incompatible with\n \\(\\rP_3\\);\n and, trivially, \n(D4\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n if\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n were false\n \\(\\rR_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)\n would be true.\n\n\nSince Zebra* instantiates the disjunctive template,\nit is non-transmissive of at least first-time justification.\nIn fact note that \\(s\\) acquires first-time justification for\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n in this case if and only if \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification for\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n based on seeing that \\(\\rP_3\\), \n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n \\(s\\) knows that\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_3\\),\n and \n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n \\(s\\) acquires first-time justification for believing\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n in virtue of\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n and\n (C2\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)).\n \n\n\nAlso note that\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n requires \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for believing\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\nnot to be independent of \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n based on seeing that \\(\\rP_3\\). However, if\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n is true, the disjunctive template requires \\(s\\) to have\njustification for believing \\(\\rQ_3\\) independent of\n\\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(\\rP_3\\) based on her seeing that\n\\(\\rP_3\\). (For if \\(s\\) could not independently exclude that\n\\(\\rQ_3\\) is false, given (D4), (D3) and (D2), \\(s\\) could not exclude\nthat the incompatible alternative \\(\\rR_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\) to\n\\(\\rP_3\\), which \\(s\\) cannot subjectively distinguish from \\(\\rP_3\\)\non the ground of her seeing that \\(\\rP_3\\), is true.) Thus, when the\ndisjunctive template is instantiated,\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n and (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)) cannot be satisfied at\nonce.\n\nThe disjunctive template has been criticized by McLaughlin (2003) on\nthe ground that the template is instantiated whenever the\njustification for \\(p\\) is fallible, i.e. compatible with\n\\(p\\)\u2019s falsity. Here is an example from Brown (2004). Take this\ndeductive argument:\n\nFox\n\n\\(\\rP_7\\).\n The animal in the garbage is a fox.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_7\\).\n The animal in the garbage is not a cat.\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(s\\) has a fallible justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_7\\)\n based on \\(s\\)\u2019s experience as if the animal in the\ngarbage is a fox. Take now \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\) to be\n\\(\\rP_7\\)\u2019s logical negation. Since the justification that \\(s\\)\nhas for \\(\\rP_7\\) is fallible, condition\n (D2)\n above is met by default. As one can easily check, conditions\n (D1),\n (D3), and\n (D4)\n are also met. So,\n Fox\n instantiates the disjunctive template. Yet it is intuitive\nthat Fox does transmit justification to its conclusion.\n\nOne could respond to McLaughlin that his objection is misplaced\nbecause the disjunctive template is meant to apply to\ninfallible, and not fallible, justification. A more\ninteresting response to McLaughlin is to refine some condition listed\nin the disjunctive template to block McLaughlin\u2019s\nargument while letting this template account for transmission failure\nof both fallible and infallible justification. Wright (2011) for\ninstance suggests replacing\n (D3)\n with the following\n condition:[7]\n\n(D3\\(^{*}\\))\n \\(r\\) is incompatible with some presupposition of the cognitive\nproject of obtaining justification for \\(p\\) in the relevant\nfashion.\n\n\nAccording to Wright\u2019s (2011) characterization, a presupposition\nof a cognitive project is any condition such that doubting it before\ncarrying out the project would rationally commit one to doubting the\nsignificance or competence of the project irrespective of its\n outcome.[8]\n For a wide class of cognitive projects, examples of these\npresuppositions include: the normal and proper functioning of the\nrelevant cognitive faculties, the reliability of utilized instruments,\nthe obtaining of the circumstances congenial to the proposed method of\ninvestigation, the soundness of relevant principles of inference\nutilized in developing and collating one\u2019s results, and so\non.\n\nWith\n (D3\\(^{*}\\))\n in the place of\n (D3),\n Fox no longer instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate. For the truth of \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\), stating that\nthe animal in the garbage is not a fox, appears to jeopardize no\npresupposition of the cognitive project of obtaining perceptual\njustification for\n \\(\\rP_7\\).\n Thus (D3\\(^{*}\\)) is not fulfilled. On the other hand, arguments that\nintuitively don\u2019t transmit do satisfy (D3\\(^{*}\\)). Take\nZebra*. In this case \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\) states that the\nanimals in the pen are mules cleverly disguised to look like zebras.\nSince \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\) entails that conditions are unsuitable\nfor attaining perceptual justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_3\\),\n \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\) looks incompatible with a presupposition of\nthe cognitive project of obtaining perceptual justification for\n\\(\\rP_3\\). Thus, \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\) does satisfy (D3\\(^{*}\\)) in\nthis case.\n",
