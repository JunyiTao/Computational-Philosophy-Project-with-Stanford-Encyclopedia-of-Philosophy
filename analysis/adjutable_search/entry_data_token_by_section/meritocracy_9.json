    "main_text": "Meritocratic Governance || Other approaches\n3.5 Other approaches\n\nAlthough Brennan has written in support of restricting the suffrage\n (\u00a73.2),\n his preferred form of governance is, apparently, what he calls\ngovernment by simulated oracle (see Brennan 2016):\n\n\nEvery citizen may vote. When citizens vote, they (a) indicate their\npolicy preferences or their preferred political outcomes, while (b)\nindicating their demographic information, and (c) taking a test of\nbasic political knowledge. The government then uses data sets (a),\n(b), and (c) to determine, statistically, what a fully informed\nelectorate would want, while correcting for the influence of race,\nincome, sex, and/or other demographic factors on the vote. In short,\ngovernment-by-simulated-oracle estimates what a demographically\nidentical but fully informed electorate would want,\nand then implements that instead of what the uninformed electorate in\nfact wants. (Brennan 2018: 55\u201356)\n\n\nWhat ought to count is not voters\u2019 expressed\npreferences\u2014which are affected by ignorance, irrationality, and\nthe other dysfunctions which so trouble him and other\nmeritocrats\u2014but their enlightened preferences. If I\ncast a vote for X rather than Y because I hold false\nbeliefs or am biased, then perhaps my vote should accrue to Y\nrather than X. For Y is what I would vote for, if\nnot for my ignorance or irrationality.\n\nWhile there has been significant work on enlightened preferences in\neconomics and political science (e.g., Althaus 2003, Caplan 2007, and\nGilens 2012), Brennan has not explored this system in any detail.\n(Ahlstrom-Vij [2022] does so, and thinks the system qualifies as\ndemocratic, not meritocratic.) One challenge is that it\u2019s\nunclear what is meant by demographic bias. Our political preferences\nare shaped by myriad elements of our identity, including our\ndemographics. Evangelical Protestants are much more opposed to\nabortion than adherents of other religions (Pew 2022). Is this bias of\nthe sort that must be neutralized? Or a predictable and bona\nfide consequence of a deeper ideology?\n\nA second strategy for dealing with the voter ignorance/irrationality\nproblem is distinguishing two political classes and assigning them\ndifferent roles. On the one hand there are regular citizens, who are\nresponsible for setting political goals and determining their\nsociety\u2019s values. That is done democratically. On the other\nhand, there are legislators and bureaucrats. They are responsible for\npursuing, in the manner they deem best, the ends identified by the\nregular citizens.\n\nThe ignorance/irrationality problem is thus putatively solved: While\nthe latter task requires expertise which the public does not have, the\nformer task does not. Indeed, perhaps the former task is enabled by\nthe folk wisdom which legislators/bureaucrats lack. One is reminded of\nWilliam F. Buckley\u2019s quip:\n\n\nI would rather be governed by the first 2,000 people in the telephone\ndirectory than by the Harvard University faculty. (Quoted in Meyer\n1961: 143)\n\n\nThis approach, which has come to be known as values-only\nvoting (Beerbohm 2012; Christiano 1996 & 2008), puts the\npublic and legislators/bureaucrats in a principal-agent relationship.\nFor instance, the public may decree, via the democratic process, that\nthe economy ought to be more equal. That goal is adopted by the\nlegislators/bureaucrats, who choose and implement the policies which,\nin their superior judgment, will best promote it. In doing so, they\ncan avoid pitfalls which the general public might not, like levying a\nluxury tax whose burden falls on workers.\n\nAs with Brennan\u2019s government by simulated oracle, there is a\ndividing line problem here: What counts as an end and what counts as a\nmeans and can they be distinguished? Dimitri Landa and Ryan Pevnick\ngive the example of a public that seeks to \u201cminimize the\ninnocent loss of life\u201d (2020: 10). In response, legislators\ndutifully ban guns and abortion. It seems like a large portion of the\npublic would be dissatisfied with how \u201cits vision\u201d was\ncarried out. Landa and Pevnick also point out that under values-only\nvoting, citizens may be unable to exert sufficient oversight\u2014an\nexample of a principal/agent problem which may afflict this\ndivision of labor.\n\nAnother proposal, most fully explored by Claudio L\u00f3pez-Guerra\n(2011, 2014, 2020), uses lotteries to reduce political influence from\nthe public broadly to a proper subset of it (see also Guerrero 2014;\nLandemore 2020; and Saunders 2010 & 2012). In\nL\u00f3pez-Guerra\u2019s envisioned system (which he does not\nunreservedly endorse and which, he says, qualifies as democratic),\nthere is universal suffrage in the sense that virtually all citizens\nare eligible to vote. But for any given election, not all do.\nSome citizens are chosen at random to participate. The rest are\ndisenfranchised (for that election). The chosen citizens engage in an\n\u201cexhaustive informative program designed to acquaint them with\nthe alternatives regarding the ballot\u201d (L\u00f3pez-Guerra\n2011: 212). Then they cast their votes. That program ensures that all\ncitizens who actually exercise political influence are\nwell-informed.\n\nIn this way, all citizens are potential meritocrats, and the\nmeritocratic class\u2014which changes from election to\nelection\u2014is determined purely at random. All citizens,\nregardless of intelligence, race, age, etc. have an equal chance to\nexercise political influence.\n\nA potential problem is the loss of aggregative power when the\nelectorate is reduced in this way. The primary justification for this\nsystem is epistemic quality: We would get better political outcomes\nunder it, according to L\u00f3pez-Guerra, relative to the democratic\nstatus quo. But one important argument in favor of the status quo\n (\u00a75.3)\n is that a large group of relatively incompetent voters may outperform\na small group of relatively competent voters. Under\nL\u00f3pez-Guerra\u2019s system, the electorate is smaller but\ncompetence is higher. Absent modeling it is unclear how it would\nperform relative to democracy.\n",
