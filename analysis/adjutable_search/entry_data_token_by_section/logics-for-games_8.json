    "main_text": "Game Structure and Game Logics || Levels of Representation\n2.1 Levels of Representation\n\nThe starting point of any logical analysis is to fix its perspective\non games. This section will review several major candidates for doing\nso, starting with the two most prominent perspectives. The first of\nthese makes the temporal structure of a game explicit, representing it\nas a tree in the standard mathematical sense.\n\nExample A two-player extensive form game.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nA game in extensive form is a tree where each non-terminal\nnode or state specifies which player is to move next, while\nedges correspond to the players\u2019 possible moves. The leaves of\nthe tree, finally, denote the possible outcomes O of game play.\nThere are many possible variations on these stipulations for states\nand moves, but they do not affect the essentials of a logical\nanalysis.\n\nThe second major perspective on games emphasizes the players\u2019\navailable strategies. Suppressing all information about temporal\nstructure, a game in strategic form yields the matrix\npictures known from game theory. In its classic interpretation, a game\nin strategic form represents a set of players that each select a\ncomplete strategy for the entire game without knowledge of the other\nplayers\u2019 choices. Each strategy profile, i.e., combination of\none strategy per player, then induces an outcome \\(O_i\\). The\nmotivation for this structure might seem complex on first sight. Yet,\nit can also be viewed as something quite simple: a one-step game with\nparallel rather than sequential moves, which is the simplest case of\nsimultaneous action.\n\nExample A two-player strategic form game.\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n\na\nb\n\nA\nc\n\\(O_1\\) \n\\(O_2\\)\n\nd\n\\(O_3\\)\n\\(O_4\\)\n\n\nExtensive and strategic forms differ in their focus. The former\nemphasize the sequential temporal structure of a game, while the\nlatter highlights strategy choice prior to play. One can freely switch\nbetween both when appropriate to the purpose at hand. Besides these\ntwo, there are other natural dimensions, highlighting players\u2019\npowers for influencing outcomes (cf.\n Section 2.5)\n or players\u2019 information about the game (cf.\n Section 3.6).\n\nRemark While all examples so far concerned two-player\ngames, no such restriction is needed. Both extensive games and\nstrategic form games work for any number of players, although\noccasional subtleties may occur. A few will be mentioned below.\nMoreover, with more players, possible coalitions enter the picture, a\ntopic that will not be treated in this entry. Finally, selected\naspects of agency may sometimes enter through the back door. Many\nscenarios in real life contain external chance events outside of any\nplayer\u2019s control, such as a roll of a die, weather conditions,\nor technical malfunctions. Such factors can usually be incorporated\ninto a logical analysis by admitting Nature as additional player.\n\n\n",
