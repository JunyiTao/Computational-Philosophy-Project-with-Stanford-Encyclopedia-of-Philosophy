    "main_text": "Should we doubt the evidential force of intellectual intuitions? || Pragmatism\n6.5 Pragmatism\n\nAnother approach that discounts the role of intuitions in philosophy,\nespecially in epistemology, is pragmatic. The idea is to first\ndetermine what epistemic goals we want principles to serve, and then\nto discover empirically which epistemic principles, if adhered to,\nwill best serve those goals (Weinberg 2006). For instance, your goal\nmight be to have lots of true beliefs or, alternatively, to have few\nfalse ones. Or your goal might be to have beliefs that make you happy.\nProbably the best set of rules to follow to obtain lots of true\nbeliefs will be different from, and more lenient than, the best set of\nrules to follow to avoid having false beliefs. Probably those sets of\nrules will be different from the set of rules you should adopt if you\nare interested in having beliefs that make you happy. It\u2019s\nreasonable to think that intuitions will have to be appealed to in\ndetermining what makes a goal an epistemic goal rather than\nsome other sort of goal, and what precisely that epistemic goal is.\nLehrer (1986: 6\u20137) holds that the epistemic goal is not\nto maximize true beliefs or minimize false ones. For him, it is the\nfollowing: for any proposition, P, that a person is\nconsidering, believe P if and only if it is true. Intuition\nmust be relied on to determine what the epistemic goal is.\nIntuitively, Pascal\u2019s Wager is about whether belief in God pays,\nnot about whether there is good evidence to believe that God exists or\ndoes not exist. The goal of the argument is not epistemic but\npragmatic in a narrow sense, namely, to believe what will make your\nlife, including your afterlife, go best for you. Intuitively, the goal\nof having beliefs that will make your life go well is not an epistemic\ngoal. Epistemic goals have to do with truth, fitting your beliefs to\nthe evidence, having evidentially justified beliefs, etc.\n\nThe pragmatic approach that sketched here seems doomed at the outset:\nit cannot avoid appealing to intuitions in order to determine what the\ncorrect epistemic goal is. And if it is appropriate to appeal to\nintuitions to determine the correct epistemic goal, why not also other\nepistemic intuitions to determine what knowledge, justification, etc.,\nare?\n",
