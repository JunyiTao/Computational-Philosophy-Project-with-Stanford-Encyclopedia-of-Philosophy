    "main_text": "\n\nAlthough Leibniz never wrote a systematic ethical treatise, in his\nview theology is a type of jurisprudence, a science of law (NE, p.\n526). And Leibniz contributed a systematic work to the field of\ntheology, namely, the Theodicy (1710), the only large-scale\nphilosophical work that he published during his lifetime. Given that\nLeibniz the natural theologian and metaphysician is, at the same time,\na moral philosopher, ethics has a central place in his philosophical\nsystem. No divisions exist among the nominally different fields. Thus\nthe view that he never wrote a systematic ethical treatise is not true\nwithout qualification. Moreover, the fact that he views theology as a\nscience of law provides some insight into the character of his ethics.\nHe offers a natural law theory, and, like other such theories, its\nbasic structure consists of a theory of the good and a theory of law.\nCompliance with the principles spelled out in the latter is necessary\nand sufficient to achieve the good. Since, according to Leibniz, God\nis the measure of the good, the primary directive of his ethics is\nthat one ought to imitate divinity as far as possible.\n",
