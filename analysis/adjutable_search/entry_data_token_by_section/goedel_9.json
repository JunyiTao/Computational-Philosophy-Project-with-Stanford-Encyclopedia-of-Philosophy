Out of 14 items, only two\nrefer to realism, remarks 10 and 12:\n\nMaterialism is false.\n\n\nConcepts have an objective existence.\n\n\nG\u00f6del published his views on realism for the first time in his\n1944. The following is one of his most quoted passages on the\nsubject:\n\n\nClasses and concepts may, however, also be conceived as real objects,\nnamely classes as \u201cpluralities of things,\u201d or as\nstructures consisting of a plurality of things and concepts as the\nproperties and relations of things existing independently of our\ndefinitions and constructions.\n\nIt seems to me that the assumption of such objects is quite as\nlegitimate as the assumption of physical bodies and there is quite as\nmuch reason to believe in their existence. They are in the same sense\nnecessary to obtain a satisfactory system of mathematics as physical\nbodies are necessary for a satisfactory theory of our sense\nperceptions and in both cases it is impossible to interpret the\npropositions one wants to assert about these entities as propositions\nabout the \u201cdata,\u201d i.e., in the latter case the actually\noccurring sense perceptions.\n\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s reference to the impossibility of interpreting\nempirical laws, or more precisely, instantiations of them\u2014the\nstatements \u201cone wants to assert,\u201d\u2014as statements\nabout sense perceptions, is likely an endorsement of the (then)\ncontemporary critique of phenomenalism. The critique was based on the\nobservation that sense data are so inextricably bound up with the\nconditions under which they are experienced, that no correspondence\nbetween statements about those and the statements \u201cwe want to\nassert\u201d can be given (see Chisholm 1948 for example). More\ngenerally G\u00f6del was against verificationism, namely the idea that\nthe meaning of a statement is its mode of verification.\n\nThe analogical point in the first part of the passage was amplified by\nG\u00f6del in the draft manuscript \u201cIs Mathematics a Syntax of\nLanguage?\u201d:\n\nIt is arbitrary to consider \u201cThis is red\u201d an immediate\ndatum, but not so to consider the proposition expressing modus ponens\nor complete induction (or perhaps some simpler propositions from which\nthe latter follows). (G\u00f6del 1995, p. 359)\n\n\nSome writers have interpreted G\u00f6del in this and similar passages\npragmatically, attributing to him the view that because empirical\nstatements are paradigmatic of successful reference, reference in the\ncase of abstract concepts should be modelled causally. (See Maddy\n1990.) Interpreting reference to abstract objects this way,\nit is argued, addresses the main difficulty associated with realism,\nthe problem how we can come to have knowledge of abstract objects.\nOthers have argued that G\u00f6del had no paradigm case in mind; that\nfor him both the empirical and the abstract case are either equally\nproblematic, or equally unproblematic. (See Tait 1986.) The latter\nview is referred to as epistemological parity in van Atten and Kennedy\n2003. (See also Kennedy and van Atten 2004.)\n\nIn his 1947 \u201cWhat is Cantor\u2019s Continuum Problem?\u201d,\nG\u00f6del expounds the view that in the case of meaningful\npropositions of mathematics, there is always a fact of the matter to\nbe decided in a yes or no fashion. This is a direct consequence of\nrealism, for if there exists a domain of mathematical objects or\nconcepts, then any meaningful proposition concerning them must be\neither true or\n false.[23]\n The Continuum Hypothesis is G\u00f6del\u2019s example of a\nmeaningful question. The concept \u201chow many\u201d leads\n\u201cunambiguously\u201d to a definite meaning of the hypothesis,\nand therefore it should be decidable\u2014at least in principle. Most\nstrikingly G\u00f6del does not leave the matter there but goes on to\noffer a practical strategy for determining the value of the continuum,\nas well as the truth value of other axioms extending ZFC.\nSpecifically, he offers two criteria for their decidability: the first\ninvolves conceptual analysis and is associated with G\u00f6del\u2019s\nrationalistic program. (See the above section on G\u00f6del\u2019s\nrationalism.) Secondly one must keep an eye on the so-called success\nof the axiom, as a check or indicator of which direction to look to\nfor the solution of its truth. For example, G\u00f6del notes in the\npaper that none of the consequences of the Axiom of Constructibility\nare very plausible. It is, then, likely false. See Maddy 2011 and\nKoellner 2014 for discussion of intrinsic vs extrinsic justifications\nfor new axioms of set theory.\n\nFor further discussion of G\u00f6del\u2019s philosophical views see\nthe supplementary documents:\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Turn to Phenomenology\n\n\nand\n\nA Philosophical Argument About the Content of Mathematics\n\n",
