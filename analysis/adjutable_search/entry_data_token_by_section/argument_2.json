    "main_text": "Types of Arguments || Deduction\n2.1 Deduction\n\nValid deductive arguments are those where the truth of the premises\nnecessitates the truth of the conclusion: the conclusion cannot\nbut be true if the premises are true. Arguments having this\nproperty are said to be deductively valid. A valid argument\nwhose premises are also true is said to be sound. Examples of\nvalid deductive arguments are the familiar syllogisms, such as:\n\n\n\nAll humans are living beings.\n\nAll living beings are mortal.\n\nTherefore, all humans are mortal.\n\n\n\nIn a deductively valid argument, the conclusion will be true in\nall situations where the premises are true, with no\nexceptions. A slightly more technical gloss of this idea goes as\nfollows: in all possible worlds where the premises hold, the\nconclusion will also hold. This means that, if I know the premises of\na deductively valid argument to be true of a given situation, then I\ncan conclude with absolute certainty that the conclusion is also true\nof that situation. An important property typically associated with\ndeductive arguments (but with exceptions, such as in relevant logic),\nand which differentiates them from inductive and abductive arguments,\nis the property of monotonicity: if premises A and\nB deductively imply conclusion C, then the addition of\nany arbitrary premise D will not invalidate the argument. In\nother words, if the argument \u201cA and B; therefore\nC\u201d is deductively valid, then the argument\n\u201cA, B and D; therefore C\u201d is\nequally deductively valid.\n\nDeductive arguments are the objects of study of familiar logical\nsystems such as (classical) propositional and predicate logic, as well\nas of subclassical systems such as intuitionistic and relevant logics\n(although in relevant logic the property of monotonicity does not\nhold, as it may lead to violations of criteria of relevance between\npremises and conclusion\u2014see entry on\n relevance logic).\n In each of these systems, the relation of logical consequence in\nquestion satisfies the property of necessary truth-preservation (see\nentry on\n logical consequence).\n This is not surprising, as these systems were originally designed to\ncapture arguments of a very specific kind, namely\nmathematical arguments (proofs), in the pioneering work of\nFrege, Russell, Hilbert, Gentzen, and others. Following a paradigm\nestablished in ancient Greek mathematics and famously captured in\nEuclid\u2019s Elements, argumentative steps in mathematical\nproofs (in this tradition at least) must have the property of\nnecessary truth preservation (Netz 1999). This paradigm remained\ninfluential for millennia, and still codifies what can be described as\nthe \u201cclassical\u201d conception of mathematical proof (Dutilh\nNovaes 2020a), even if practices of proof are ultimately also quite\ndiverse. (In fact, there is much more to argumentation in mathematics\nthan just deductive argumentation [Aberdein & Dove 2013].)\n\nHowever, a number of philosophers have argued that deductive validity\nand necessary truth preservation in fact come apart. Some have reached\nthis conclusion motivated by the familiar logical paradoxes such as\nthe Liar or Curry\u2019s paradox (Beall 2009; Field 2008; see entries\non the\n Liar paradox\n and on\n Curry\u2019s paradox).\n Others have defended the idea that there are such things as\ncontingent logical truths (Kaplan 1989; Nelson & Zalta\n2012), which thus challenge the idea of necessary truth preservation.\nIt has also been suggested that what is preserved in the transition\nfrom premises to conclusions in deductive arguments is in fact\nwarrant or assertibility rather than truth (Restall 2004).\nYet others, such as proponents of preservationist approaches to\nparaconsistent logic, posit that what is preserved by the deductive\nconsequence relation is the coherence, or incoherence, of a set of\npremises (Schotch, Brown, & Jennings 2009; see entry on\n paraconsistent logic).\n Nevertheless, it is fair to say that the view that deductive validity\nis to be understood primarily in terms of necessary truth preservation\nis still the received view.\n\nRelatedly, there are a number of pressing philosophical issues\npertaining to the justification of deduction, such as the exact nature\nof the necessity involved in deduction (metaphysical, logical,\nlinguistic, epistemic; Shapiro 2005), and the possibility of offering\na non-circular foundation for deduction (Dummett 1978). Furthermore,\nit is often remarked that the fact that a deductive argument is not\nampliative may entail that it cannot be informative, which in turn\nwould mean that its usefulness is quite limited; this problem has been\ndescribed as \u201cthe scandal of deduction\u201d (Sequoiah-Grayson\n2008).\n\nBe that as it may, deductive arguments have occupied a special place\nin philosophy and the sciences, ever since Aristotle presented the\nfirst fully-fledged theory of deductive argumentation and reasoning in\nthe Prior Analytics (and the corresponding theory of\nscientific demonstration in the Posterior Analytics; see\n Historical Supplement).\n The fascination for deductive arguments is understandable, given\ntheir allure of certainty and indubitability. The more\ngeometrico (a phrase introduced by Spinoza to describe the\nargumentative structure of his Ethics as following \u201ca\ngeometrical style\u201d\u2014see entry on\n Spinoza)\n has been influential in many fields other than mathematics. However,\nthe focus on deductive arguments at the expense of other types of\narguments has arguably skewed investigations on argument and\nargumentation too much in one specific direction (see (Bermejo-Luque\n2020) for a critique of deductivism in the study of\nargumentation).\n\nIn recent decades, the view that everyday reasoning and argumentation\nby and large do not follow the canons of deductive argumentation has\nbeen gaining traction. In psychology of reasoning, Oaksford and Chater\nwere the first to argue already in the 1980s that human reasoning\n\u201cin the wild\u201d is essentially probabilistic, following the\nbasic canons of Bayesian probabilities (Oaksford & Chater 2018;\nElqayam 2018; see\n section 5.3\n below). Computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers\nhave also developed a strong interest in non-monotonic reasoning and\nargumentation (Reiter 1980), recognizing that, outside specific\nscientific contexts, human reasoning tends to be deeply\ndefeasible (Pollock 1987; see entries on\n non-monotonic logic\n and\n defeasible reasoning).\n Thus seen, deductive argumentation might be considered as the\nexception rather than the rule in human argumentative practices taken\nas a whole (Dutilh Novaes 2020a). But there are others, especially\nphilosophers, who still maintain that the use of deductive reasoning\nand argumentation is widespread and extends beyond niches of\nspecialists (Shapiro 2014; Williamson 2018).\n",
