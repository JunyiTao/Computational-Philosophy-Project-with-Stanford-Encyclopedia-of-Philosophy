    "main_text": "Memory and Personal Identity || Theory of Memory\n5.1 Theory of Memory\n\n\nConsistent with Reid's faculty psychology, memory is a faculty of its\nown and it takes a unique set of objects. Just as the faculty of\nperception takes as its objects mind-independent bodies, the faculty\nof memory takes as its objects events in the past. Reid develops this\ninto a direct theory of memory akin to his direct theory of\nperception, and in contrast to the Ideal Theory and account of memory\n(Copenhaver 2006).\n\n\nThe objects of memory are events in the past. Just like perceptions,\nmemories are accompanied by their own phenomenology and sensory\nexperience. When one remembers hitting a game-winning serve in a\nvolleyball match, one may experience memory-images of the court and\nfeelings of triumph. However, the imagery and emotion accompanying the\nmemory are not identical to the memory. To suggest that they are\nidentical to the memory is to confuse the psychological means by which\nthe memory occurs with the content of the memory belief. In Reid's day\nthe theory of memory endorsed by proponents of the Theory of Ideas\nmade a similar confusion, in his opinion, by claiming that memories\nare mental events in which a past idea is compared to a present\nidea. According to Reid, these philosophers confused the act of\nremembering with the thing remembered (see EIP 3.1).\n\n\nThe direct theory distinguishes personal memory from factual memory\n(Hamilton 2003). \u201cI remember hitting the winning serve\u201d is\nan example of personal memory, which does not take form as a\npropositional attitude. Those memories that do take form as\npropositional attitudes, e.g. \u201cI remember that I hit the winning\nserve,\u201d are not necessarily personal memories. This is because I\nmay remember hitting the winning serve only because my best friend has\nreminded me of that over the years. In that case my memory is not\nknown directly by virtue of the fact that I have not thought in the\nfirst-person of an event in my past; instead, this memory arises\nthrough inference from testimony.\n\n\nReid's advocacy of a direct theory of memory requires a commitment to\nthe claim that memories take past events as their objects, which\ncontrasts with Locke's theory. Reid explains this contrast with an\nexample having to do with the fact that, yesterday, he has smelled a\ncertain rose, and that, today, he remembers smelling the rose's\nfragrance:\nPhilosophers indeed tell me, that the immediate object of\nmy memory and imagination in this case, is not the past sensation, but\nan idea of it, an image, phantasm, or species of the odour I smelled:\nthat this idea now exists in my mind, or in my sensorium; and the mind\ncontemplating this present idea, finds it a representation of what is\npast, or of what may exist; and accordingly calls it memory... This is\nthe doctrine of the Ideal Philosophy. [But] memory appears to me to\nhave things that are past, and not present ideas, for its\nobject. ... I beg leave to think with the vulgar, that when I remember\nthe smell of the tuberose, that very sensation which I had yesterday,\nand which has now no more any existence, is the immediate object of my\nmemory. (IHM 2.3, 28)\n\n\nPersonal memories are present-tense mental states with first-person\nperspective that take past events as intentional objects.\n\n\nTo clarify the epistemology of memory, Reid distinguishes between\ndistinct and indistinct memories. He says distinct memories are\n\u201creal knowledge\u201d and indistinct memories are not:\n\u201cMemory is always accompanied with the belief of that which we\nremember, as perception is accompanied with the belief of that which\nwe perceive,\u201d which emphasizes the structural similarity between\nthe two faculties. He adds, \u201cin mature years, and in a sound\nstate of mind, every man feels that he must believe what he distinctly\nremembers, though he can give no other reason of his belief, but that\nhe remembers the thing distinctly\u201d (EIP 3.1, 254). This final\nremark gestures at the unaccountability of memory.\n\n\nReid exemplifies his commitment to the unaccountability of memory\nexperience by placing a first principle about memory in his set of\nfirst principles of contingent truths: \u201cThat those things did\nreally happen which I distinctly remember\u201d (EIP 6.5, 474). Reid\nillustrates the cogency of this first principle by describing a\ncourtroom scene in which a defense attorney appeals to global\nskepticism about the reliability of memory in an effort to undermine\nthe devastating testimony of eyewitness about the actions of his\nclient. The argument \u201cwould have no other effect upon the judge\nor jury, than to convince them that he was disordered in his\njudgement\u201d (EIP 6.5, 475). The canonization of memory in his set\nof first principles indicates that Reid does not believe that the\nreliability of the faculty of memory can be justified in a\nnon-circular way since any attempt to demonstrate its reliability will\npresuppose its reliability (EIP 6.4, 481; IHM 2.3, 28).\n\n\nReid attempts to explain why memory is unaccountable:\nThe knowledge which I have of things past by my memory,\nseems to me as unaccountable as an immediate knowledge would be of\nthings to come; and I can give no reason why I should have the one and\nnot the other, but that such is the will of my Maker. (EIP 3.2,\n255\u20136)\nWhen I believe that I washed my hands and face this morning, there\nappears no necessity in the truth of this proposition. It might be, or\nit might not be. A man may distinctly conceive it without believing it\nat all. How then do I come to believe it? I remember it\ndistinctly. This is all I can say. (EIP 3.2, 256)\n\n\nWhen Reid says \u2018memory is unaccountable\u2019 he means that we don't know\nwhy distinct memory is always accompanied by belief; we don't know why\nit reliably produces true belief; and we can't established that memory\nbeliefs are true in a non-circular fashion (van Woudenberg\n2004). Further analysis of the epistemology of memory belief is\nprevented by virtue of this unaccountability. This insight about the\nepistemology of memory belief indicates subtlety about the limits of\nanalysis, which has drawn favorable comparisons to Wittgenstein\n(Wolterstorff 2000, ch. 9).\n",
