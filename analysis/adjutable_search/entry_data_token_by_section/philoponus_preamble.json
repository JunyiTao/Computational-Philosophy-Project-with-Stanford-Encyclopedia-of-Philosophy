    "main_text": "\n\n\nJohn Philoponus, a Christian philosopher, scientist, and theologian\nwho lived approximately from 490 to 570 CE, is also known as John the\nGrammarian or John of Alexandria. The epithet \u2018Philoponus\u2019\nmeans literally \u2018Lover of toil\u2019.  Philoponus\u2019 life and\nwork are closely connected to the city of Alexandria and the\nAlexandrian Neoplatonic school. Although the Aristotelian-Neoplatonic\ntradition was the source of his intellectual roots and concerns, he\nwas an original thinker who eventually broke with that tradition in\nmany important respects, both substantive and methodological, and\ncleared part of the way which led to more critical and empirical\napproaches in the natural sciences. Which intellectual, religious, or\nother cultural circumstances of his life and times may have put\nPhiloponus into the position to initiate and foreshadow the eventual\ndemise of Aristotelianism is a most fascinating question. Scholarship has done much in recent years to arrive at a fuller appreciation of the work and accomplishment of this important late antique philosopher.\n",
