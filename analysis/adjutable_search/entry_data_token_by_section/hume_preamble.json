    "main_text": "\n\nGenerally regarded as one of the most important philosophers to write\nin English, David Hume (1711\u20131776) was also well known in his\nown time as an historian and essayist. A master stylist in any genre,\nhis major philosophical works\u2014A Treatise of Human\nNature (1739\u20131740), the Enquiries concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1748) and concerning the Principles of\nMorals (1751), as well as his posthumously published\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion (1779)\u2014remain\nwidely and deeply influential.\n\nAlthough Hume\u2019s more conservative contemporaries denounced his\nwritings as works of scepticism and atheism, his influence is evident\nin the moral philosophy and economic writings of his close friend Adam\nSmith. Kant reported that Hume\u2019s work woke him from his\n\u201cdogmatic slumbers\u201d (Prolegomena, Introduction)\nand Jeremy Bentham remarked that reading Hume \u201ccaused the scales\nto fall\u201d from his eyes (\u201cA Fragment on Government\u201d,\nchapter 1, paragraph 36, footnote 2).  Charles Darwin regarded his\nwork as a central influence on the theory of evolution. The diverse\ndirections in which these writers took what they gleaned from reading\nhim reflect both the richness of their sources and the wide range of\nhis empiricism. Today, philosophers recognize Hume as a thoroughgoing\nexponent of philosophical naturalism, as a precursor of contemporary\ncognitive science, and as the inspiration for several of the most\nsignificant types of ethical theory developed in contemporary moral\nphilosophy.\n",
