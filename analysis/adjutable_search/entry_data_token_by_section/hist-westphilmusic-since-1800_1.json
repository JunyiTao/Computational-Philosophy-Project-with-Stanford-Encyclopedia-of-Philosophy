    "main_text": "Nineteenth Century || Romantic Metaphysics of Music: Schopenhauer\n1.2 Romantic Metaphysics of Music: Schopenhauer\n\nThe art of music occupies a central place in Arthur\nSchopenhauer\u2019s (1788\u20131860) philosophical system, with\nwhich it is inextricably linked. A brief overview of\nSchopenhauer\u2019s system is thus in order. He accepts the Kantian\ndistinction between the world as it is in itself and as it appears to\nus, but rejects Kant\u2019s claim that we cannot know reality as it\nis independently from its phenomenal manifestation. As representing\nsubjects, our knowledge is bound by what Schopenhauer terms\nprincipium individuationis, which orders representations\naccording to a spatio-temporal structure and determines causal\nrelationships between them. Objects are thus given to us in a mediated\nfashion, as representations. But one object is given to us as\nexperiencing subjects both in a mediated and in an unmediated fashion.\nThis is our own body, which is experienced both from the outside, as a\nrepresentation, and from the inside, as an incessant succession of\ndrives and impulses. Schopenhauer claims that this reveals the\nfundamental noumenal essence of the world as Will. Since the Will is\nendless striving and desiring, and since desiring and striving are by\nnature sources of pain, the world is essentially characterized by\nsuffering. Additionally, Schopenhauer claims that the Will objectifies\nitself in the world through a set of Platonic Ideas, which exist\nbeyond the principium individuationis, and are ranked\naccording to the degree in which the Will is objectivized in them.\n\nIn Schopenhauer\u2019s system, art acquires its value from its\ncapacity to represent the Ideas, exploiting a form of cognition that\nis different from rational and intellectual cognition, which by nature\ncannot go beyond the principium individuationis. This\ncognition is valuable because it removes us from the network of\ndeterministically linked representations and motives that constitute\nour ordinary existence in the thralls of our desires and longings.\n\nSchopenhauer ranks the various arts according to the Ideas they\nrepresent. The higher the degree of objectivation of the Will in a\ngiven Idea, the higher the hierarchical position of the art\nrepresenting that Idea. Accordingly, architecture is found at the\nbottom of the hierarchy, as it deals with the Ideas of basic physical\nforces and inanimate matter, whereas tragedy occupies the highest\nposition, as it represents the struggles of the human condition, where\nthe Will is most evidently manifest.\n\nIn this hierarchy of the arts, music\u2019s value is superior even to\nthat of tragedy. According to Schopenhauer, music is not a\nrepresentation of Ideas, but rather of the Will itself. Music and the\nworld are expressions of the same metaphysical principle, the Will.\nThis motivates Schopenhauer\u2019s remark that music could exist even\nif there were no world at all (1819: \u00a752). If music is an\nexpression of the Will just as the world is, and given that the Will\nobjectifies itself in the world through the Platonic Ideas, one can\ntrace a parallel between music and degrees of objectivation of the\nWill. Particularly, Schopenhauer sets up an analogy between pitch\nrange and degrees of objectivation. Thus, the lowest areas of the\naudible pitch range are associated with the lowest degrees, such as\ninorganic nature and physical forces, whereas the higher regions of\nthe pitch range match with the highest level of objectivation of the\nWill, self-conscious human beings. Schopenhauer motivates this\nanalysis through a rather audacious interpretation of both acoustics\nand music theory. This series of correspondences between music and the\nextra-musical world is reminiscent of the Pythagorean notion of\ncelestial harmony (see the entry\n history of western philosophy of music: from antiquity to 1800, section 1.1).\n Schopenhauer questionably and conveniently identifies high pitch with\nmelody. This is questionable because the melodic element in music is\nnot determined by pitch range, but rather by relational properties,\nnor is a melody always composed of the highest notes in a given piece.\nIt is convenient, because the parallel between pitch range and degrees\nof objectivation allows Schopenhauer to consider the unfolding of a\nmelody as analogous to human emotional life. Much as human life is\ncharacterized by an alternation of need and satisfaction, melodies\nfeature continuous shifts from tension to relaxation. The emotions we\nencounter in music have a peculiar status: they are neither\nparticular, for they are beyond the principium\nindividuationis, nor general, as they are not abstracted from\nparticular cases as concepts are, and cannot therefore be captured\nlinguistically.\n\nIt should be stressed that, according to Schopenhauer, music does not\narouse such emotions in the listener, and if it did, it would\nnot be valuable on those grounds. In fact, the value of music resides\nexactly in its capacity to present us with the Will in its highest\ndegree of objectivation, without having to experience its stirrings\nourselves\u2014the latter experience would be an inherently\nunpleasant one, according to Schopenhauer. The value of music as art\nis thus, according to Schopenhauer, eminently cognitive.\n\nFrom this view of music, some normative consequences follow. First,\nbecause the analogy between music and the world depends on their being\nexpressions of the same metaphysical Will, and because the Will lies\nbeyond the scope of conceptual knowledge, Schopenhauer condemns\nimitative music, as this depicts the world by imitating its sonic\nappearance to a subject, rather than its inner essence. Second,\nbecause the knowledge provided by music is superior to discursive\nknowledge, Schopenhauer dismisses works and genres in which the music\nis subservient to the lyrics. Third, because Schopenhauer holds the\nmusic\u2019s melodic element to be central to its value, he is\ndismissive of music in which melody is inconspicuous (\u201cIn the\ncompositions of today there is more emphasis on the harmony than the\nmelody; I however take the opposite view and regard melody as the core\nof music, to which harmony relates as does sauce to a roast\u201d\nSchopenhauer 1851: chapter 19, \u00a7 219).\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s view of music influenced a number of composers.\nHis impact on Richard Wagner could hardly have been greater (see\n \u00a71.4;\n Magee 1997: chapter 17; Karnes & Mitchell 2020; on\nSchopenhauer\u2019s musical aesthetics, see Alperson 1981; Budd 1985:\nchapter 5; Wicks 2008: 106\u2013111).\n",
