    "main_text": "The descriptive question: What are the features of consciousness? || Self-perspectival organization\n4.5 Self-perspectival organization\n\n\nThe perspectival structure of consciousness is one aspect of its\noverall phenomenal organization, but it is important enough to merit\ndiscussion in its own right. Insofar as the key perspective is that of\nthe conscious self, the specific feature might be called\nself-perspectuality. Conscious experiences do not exist as\nisolated mental atoms, but as modes or states of a conscious self or\nsubject (Descartes 1644, Searle 1992, though pace Hume 1739). A visual\nexperience of a blue sphere is always a matter of there being some self\nor subject who is appeared to in that way. A sharp and stabbing pain is\nalways a pain felt or experienced by some conscious subject. The self\nneed not appear as an explicit element in our experiences, but as Kant\n(1787) noted the \u201cI think\u201d must at least potentially\naccompany each of them.\n\n\nThe self might be taken as the perspectival point from which the\nworld of objects is present to experience (Wittgenstein 1921). It\nprovides not only a spatial and temporal perspective for our experience\nof the world but one of meaning and intelligibility as well. The\nintentional coherence of the experiential domain relies upon the dual\ninterdependence between self and world: the self as perspective from\nwhich objects are known and the world as the integrated structure of\nobjects and events whose possibilities of being experienced implicitly\ndefine the nature and location of the self (Kant 1787, Husserl\n1929).\n\n\nConscious organisms obviously differ in the extent to which they\nconstitute a unified and coherent self, and they likely differ\naccordingly in the sort or degree of perspectival focus they embody in\ntheir respective forms of experience (Lorenz 1977). Consciousness may\nnot require a distinct or substantial self of the traditional Cartesian\nsort, but at least some degree of perspectivally self-like organization\nseems essential for the existence of anything that might count as\nconscious experience. Experiences seem no more able to exist without a\nself or subject to undergo them than could ocean waves exist without\nthe sea through which they move. The Descriptive question thus requires\nsome account of the self-perspectival aspect of experience and the\nself-like organization of conscious minds on which it depends, even if\nthe relevant account treats the self in a relatively deflationary and\nvirtual way (Dennett 1991, 1992).\n",
