    "main_text": "Major Themes of Diderot\u2019s Philosophy || Determinism and change\n2.4 Determinism and change\n\nAll forms of materialism are deterministic, but in different ways.\nNothing compels the materialist to accept that the body and the\npassions are deterministic just like a simple machine.\nUnsurprisingly, a lot depends on how causes are understood,\nand how much weight they are meant to bear in both an ontology and an\naccount of action (see entry on\n causal determinism).\n Thus it is quite possible to hold, like Helv\u00e9tius,\nd\u2019Holbach or Hobbes, that there is a fixed, stable and\npredictable relation between our sensory input, our mental life and\nconsequently our \u201ctemper\u201d and our actions. \u201cAs a\nbeing that is organized so as to think and to feel\u201d,\nD\u2019Holbach explained, \u201cyou must feel pleasure or pain; you\nmust love or hate in accordance with the way your organs are affected\nby the causes surrounding you or within you\u201d (D\u2019Holbach\n1770/1781: I.i [1990: 18]).\n\nBut the organismic elements in Diderot\u2019s materialism and vision\nof the body lead him to challenge Helv\u00e9tius\u2019 program of\nreform, which asserts, on the basis of an empiricist and specifically\nsensationalist epistemology, that human beings really are fully\nmodifiable \u201cblank slates\u201d, modifiable in terms of\nwhat we call stimuli and responses. Interestingly, it is by denying\nthis \u201cfull modifiability\u201d that Diderot can defend a\ncertain notion of individuality. The fact that individuals differ from\neach other at the level of their organisation grants them a\ndegree of self-determination. \u201cEvery day, I see men who prefer\nto die rather than to correct themselves\u201d (DPV XVIII: 344). That\nis, what Diderot calls \u201cmodifiability\u201d, which might better\nbe termed \u201ccorrigibility\u201d, has limits, and these limits do\nnot just reflect some kind of blunt innatism (whether of genetic\nheritage or of character), but rather a degree of individuality,\nincluding at the level of agency. Biologically, Diderot often stressed\nthe enormous variation of traits such as intelligence from one\nindividual to another, noting that the difference between an\n\u201cidiot\u201d and a \u201cgenius\u201d hinges on tiny shifts\nin \u201cbrain fibers\u201d. There is more difference, he insists,\nbetween one individual and another in terms of intelligence than\nbetween a human being and an animal (DPV XXIV: 299). But there is no\nsharp divide between the biological and the personal, for Diderot.\n\nHelv\u00e9tius had described to Diderot how severely he was punished\nfor De l\u2019Esprit, with the consequence that he would\n\u201crather die than write another line again\u201d. Diderot\nresponds with a long tale about two cats he saw from his window, who\nfell from a roof. One died from the fall, but the other got up,\nbruised and bloodied, and said to himself,\n\n\nI would rather die than ever climb on the roof again. What am I\nlooking for up there? A mouse that is not worth the tasty morsel I\ncould get from my mistress, or steal from the cook \u2026\n\n\nHowever, as soon as the cat feels better, he climbs back up on the\nroof again (RH; DPV XXIV: 542\u2013543). Just like the cat\nis determined by his own constitution and drives, similarly,\nHelv\u00e9tius has no choice but to go on writing.\n\nDiderot\u2019s determinism is also his way of extending core\nempiricist tenets such as nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit\nin sensu (there is nothing in the mind that was not first in our\nsense), which acquires a determinist dimension: \u201cthere is only\none operation in man, sensing. This operation is \u2026 never\nfree\u201d (OH; DPV XXIV: 300; cf. PC; DPV XX: 85)\nand\n\n\nperception comes from sensation; from perception, we get reflection,\nmeditation and judgment. There is nothing free in intellectual\noperations, or in sensation. (EP; DPV XVII: 335)\n\n\nThere is also a tension in Diderot\u2019s approach to determinism\nbetween his acceptance of physicalism (\u201cthere is only one kind\nof cause \u2026 physical causes\u201d: to Landois, DPV IX: 258) and\ncausal closure (\u201cthe physical world and the moral world are one\nand the same\u201d: PC; DPV XX: 53), and his insistence that\nagency, which for him covers the action of complex organisms overall\nand is not restricted to humans or even higher mammals, requires\nanother, specific kind of causality: \u201cI am a man, and I require\ncauses proper to man\u201d (RH; DPV XXIV: 523). Diderot is\nnot defending free will or an unchallenged space of agency, yet there\nis a kind of residual anthropocentrism in some of his arguments,\npresented in the language of unified causality. As he explains:\n\n\nWithout regard for the sum of elements of which I am composed, I am\none, and a cause only has one effect. I have always been one single\ncause [une cause une], thus I have never had more than one\neffect to produce; my duration is thus nothing more than a succession\nof necessary effects.\n\n\nDiderot is neither asserting total interconnection (as in Laplacian\ndeterminism) nor defending the existence of freedom to act as\n\u201cindifference\u201d or \u201cagent causation\u201d, but an\nintermediate view (once known as the Hume-Mill thesis) according to\nwhich what it is to be \u201cme\u201d is to be a particular causal\nnexus.In that sense, I cannot \u201cdo otherwise than myself\u201d\nor \u201cbe anyone other than myself\u201d (JLF; DPV XXIII:\n190, 28; on Diderot on individuality and selfhood, see Thiel 2015,\nWolfe 2015).\n\nHowever, in good Lucretian fashion, this unified causal loop we call\n\u201courself\u201d or \u201cmyself\u201d is itself subject to\nwhat Diderot terms \u201cvicissitude\u201d, a term that connotes\nchange and flux in this context.\n\n\nIn one and the same man, everything is in perpetual\nvicissitude\u2026 It is only by means of memory that we are the same\nindividual to others and to ourselves. At my age, there may not be a\nsingle molecule in my body that I brought into the world at my birth;\n(DPD; DPV X: 423)\n\neverything changes, everything passes \u2026 only the Whole remains.\n(RA; DPV XVII: 128)\n\n\nDiderot wrote that\n\n\nfruits, vegetables and animals are in perpetual vicissitude as regards\ntheir qualities, forms and constituents; an ancient from four thousand\nyears ago or better, our nephews in ten thousand years will most\nlikely recognize none of the fruits we have today;\n\n\nthus\n\n\nwe must be extremely careful in our judgments of the ancient\nhistorians and naturalists regarding the forms, virtues and other\nqualities of beings which are in perpetual alteration.\n(\u201cAcmella\u201d, Enc. I: 460a)\n\n\nThe instability in this continual movement between seemingly free and\nwillful individuality and collective, biological/metaphysical\ndeterminism also sits at the heart of the perpetual dialectic between\n\u201cMoi\u201dand \u201cLui\u201d in Le Neveu de\nRameau.\n\nFurther, this emphasis on mutability, change and\n\u201cvicissitudes\u201d including at a specifically biological\nlevel can sound evolutionary to a post-Darwinian reader, and for\nDiderot, \u201cto be born, to live, to die is merely to change\nforms\u201d (RA; DPV XVII: 139), in the\n\u201cever-changing\u201d \u201coverall order of nature\u201d:\n\u201cEverything is in in fluxu et eterno et perpetuo et\nnecessario\u201d (OH; DPV XXIV: 317). He also\nexplicitly uses the Lucretian phrase Rerum novus nascitur\nordo. Should these passages be understood as anticipations of\nevolutionary science? In fact, contrary to a widespread tendency in\nolder scholarship, it is mistaken to consider Diderot as either a\npredecessor or a speculative exponent of evolutionary doctrines. That\nhe was an earnest disciple of Lucretius, fascinated with monsters and\nwith the transience and mutability of the physical (particularly the\nliving) universe overall, does not make him a \u201cforerunner of\nDarwin\u201d.\n\nOn the biological side, his fascination with monsters also feeds into\nhis philosophy of nature overall. \u201cOn the entire surface of the\nearth\u201d, he writes,\n\n\nthere is not a single man who is normally constituted or perfectly\nhealthy. The human species is just a mass of more or less counterfeit,\nmore or less sick individuals \u2026 What I say of man applies just\nas well to animals, plants or minerals. (EP; DPV XVII:\n515)\n\n\nThis explains why, as he had written earlier,\n\n\nthe dissection of a monster \u2026 is more useful to the historian\nof nature [i.e., the experimental life scientist or biologist in\nmodern parlance] than the study of one hundred individuals who\nresemble each other.
