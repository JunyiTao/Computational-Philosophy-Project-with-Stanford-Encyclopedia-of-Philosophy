    "main_text": "Distinctive Features of the Ontology of Natural Language || Intentional or Nonexistent Objects\n3.2 Intentional or Nonexistent Objects\n\nThe view that there are nonexistent or intentional objects,\nMeinongianism, is a highly controversial philosophical view (van\nInwagen 2003; entries on\n existence,\n nonexistent objects,\n fictional entities).\n But it is a view that is often motivated or defended by appeal to\nnatural language (Fine 1982; van Inwagen 1977; Kripke 2013; McGinn\n2000; Parsons 1980; Priest 2005; Salmon 1987, 1998; Thomasson 1999),\nnamely sentences with existence predicates or intentional verbs such\nas look for or think about:\n\n(9)\n\n\na.\n Pegasus does not exist.\nb.\n John thought about / was looking for Pegasus.\n\n\n\nThe Meinongian takes Pegasus in\n (9a)\n and\n (9b)\n to stand for a nonexistent object. There is an alternative view,\nthough, on which it is an exceptional, empty occurrence of a name\n(Sainsbury 2005). Linguistic support for the Meinongian view comes\nfrom the fact that Pegasus in\n (8a)\n and\n (8b)\n fulfills standard criteria for referential terms, such as supporting\nanaphora and allowing for replacement by quantifiers\n(something), as well as from the compositional semantics of\nconstructions with relative clauses as below (Moltmann 2016):\n\n(10)\n\n\na.\nThe building John thought about does not exist.\nb.\n John thought about a building that does not exist.\n\n\n\nA compositional semantics of the relative clause constructions in\n (10a, b)\n can hardly be achieved without positing intentional objects as\narguments of both think about and exist. The task\nfor natural language ontology then is to develop a theory of\nintentional objects that is both coherent and does justice to their\nrestricted occurrences in the semantic structure of sentences.\n\nIf descriptive metaphysics is conceived as the \u201cmetaphysics of\nappearances\u201d, this might suggest that non-existent objects would\nhave to be posited as semantic values of referential NPs even with\nextensional predicates. Referential NPs should reflect entities of a\ncertain sort whether or not they exist. However, non-intentional\npredicates are existence-entailing (Priest 2005), which means that in\nextensional contexts only actual entities as semantic values of\nreferential NPs contribute to truth conditions. Thus, the building\nis tall is true only if the building being referred to is an\nactual building that is tall. In extensional contexts, referential NPs\nthat turn out not to refer to actual entities better fail to have a\nsemantic value rather than standing for nonexistent objects. \n\nIn intensional contexts, intentional objects have been posited also as\nsemantic values of anaphora, both within the context of an attitude of\na single agent and across attitudinal contexts involving different\nagents (Edelberg 1986). In those contexts, intentional objects serve\nas discourse referents (Karttunen 1976) and thus interact with dynamic\nsemantics, being individuated not just by what properties agents\nattribute to them, but also by the flow of information in the\ndiscourse (Edelberg 1986). Discourse referents in fact have sometimes\nbeen conceived ontologically even in extensional contexts (Landman\n1986), though this is not the dominant view in dynamic semantics (see\nentry on\n dynamic semantics).\n",
