Breaking free of the\ntranslation agenda, a new work was imagined, to be edited by Diderot\nand D\u2019Alembert, that would serve as the vehicle promoting the\nnew philosophie.\n\nIn November 1750, Diderot released a \u201cProspectus\u201d for the\nEncyclop\u00e9die, inviting readers to subscribe to a new\nmultivolume compendium. In this preview, Diderot began to reveal his\nconception of what the Encyclop\u00e9die would become. No\nlonger a translation of someone else\u2019s book, and even less a\nstaid compendium of already established learning, Diderot imagined the\nEncyclop\u00e9die as a dynamic site of living thought, an\nengine for changing, not codifying, existing knowledge. These ideas\nwere further developed in Diderot\u2019s article\n\u201cEncyclop\u00e9die\u201d, which was published in volume V of\nthe work in 1755.\n\nThe middle of the eighteenth century has appeared to many as a\nwatershed moment in French intellectual history. As a\nnineteenth-century commentator put it, after this date \u201cwritings\nhostile to religion appeared and multiplied, and a war broke out\nbetween skepticism and faith\u201d (Wilson 1972: 94\u201395, quoting\nan editor of Barbier 1857: vol. 4, p. 378, fn. 1). Whatever the prior\npreparation, the launch of the Encyclop\u00e9die at\nprecisely this moment fueled this dynamic, and it quickly provoked a\nwar between its editors and the religious authorities in France. At\nthe heart of the struggle were the Jesuits, especially\nGuillaume-Fran\u00e7ois Berthier, who used the Jesuit journal to\nattack the new encyclopedia project and its editors. Diderot responded\nwith pamphlets, and this sparring continued as the first two volumes\nof the Encyclop\u00e9die appeared in print.\n\nThe tension with French clerical authorities worsened when the\nabb\u00e9 de Prades, a friend of Diderot\u2019s and contributor to\nthe Encyclop\u00e9die\u2014he wrote the entry\n\u201cCertitude\u201d\u2014successfully defended what was later\ndeemed to be a theologically suspect doctoral thesis. The controversy\nled the crown to temporarily suspend the publication\nprivil\u00e8ge for the Encyclop\u00e9die, but\nthanks to the favor that Diderot and his partners enjoyed in higher\nplaces, publication was resumed and Volumes II\u2013VI appeared\nwithout pause between 1751\u20131756 even though accompanied by\nongoing criticism from the Jesuits.\n\nNew controversies over the Encyclop\u00e9die occurred in\n1757, although the return of unrest had little overtly to do with\nphilosophie. The trigger was an attempt on King Louis\nXV\u2019s life by a house servant named Damiens, who stabbed the king\nwith a small penknife. The act of regicide itself was less significant\nfor the Encyclop\u00e9die than the perceived motivation for\nthe crime, for authorities began to link Damiens\u2019s purported\nmadness to the unchecked spread of subversive philosophie.\nProvoked by these public fears, French authorities issued new edicts\ncracking down on allegedly subversive books, and new works critical of\nthe Encyclop\u00e9die also appeared, generating the idea of\nan \u201cEncyclopedist party\u201d organized for the purpose of\nattacking morality, religion and government. When Volume VII appeared\nsoon after Damiens\u2019s attack, the tinder was therefore set for a\nnew eruption of controversy.\n\nThe controversy grew intense, leading D\u2019Alembert to resign as\neditor, putting Diderot in sole control of the project. The final blow\nagainst the Encyclop\u00e9die occurred in July 1758 when\nClaude-Adrien Helv\u00e9tius published On the Mind (De\nl\u2019Esprit), one of the most overtly materialist and\nheterodox works of the French Enlightenment. Although Helv\u00e9tius\nwas not technically an encyclop\u00e9diste, he certainly\nmoved in the same circles, and his work fit comfortably with the\nimaginary template of subversive materialist philosophie that\ncrystallized after the Damiens Affair. Accordingly, as the officials\nin charge of securing public order, morality, and the book\ntrade\u2014the three were one in absolutist France\u2014began to\ncrack down on Helv\u00e9tius and De l\u2019Esprit, the\nEncyclop\u00e9die found itself pulled into the courts as a\nsupposed accomplice aiding and abetting its crimes.\n\nThanks to a secretive ad hoc agreement, however, work on the final ten\nvolumes of the Encyclop\u00e9die was allowed to continue,\nleading to the full publication of the work in 1765 with each of the\nvolumes falsely indicating a publication in Neuch\u00e2tel as a way\nof complying with the royal ban. During the same years, the volumes of\naccompanying plates appeared since they were not subject to the ban,\nand by 1772 the final volumes of the plates were published to\naccompany the seventeen volumes of text that were already in print.\nWith that the entire Encyclop\u00e9die was brought to\ncompletion.\n",
