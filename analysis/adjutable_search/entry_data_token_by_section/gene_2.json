This\nrequired other experimental systems, which began to take shape in the\n1930s to 1950s (Morange 2020, Part One). For instance, Max\nDelbr\u00fcck (1906\u20131981) and others turned to T-phages (viruses\nthat infect the bacterium e.coli) because they assumed that\nviruses were essentially \u201cnaked genes\u201d. While these\nresearchers were able to show that genetic phenomena (mutation,\nexchange of genetic material) were present in viruses and bacteria as\nwell and to achieve higher resolution of analysis, this work remained\nas formal as Drosophila genetics. It was only through\nintegrating new technologies from physics and chemistry into the new\nexperimental systems that microbial genetics led to molecular\ngenetics. Results from biochemical work in biomedical microbiology and\nfrom work involving radioactive isotopes to label biological molecules\nprovided evidence that DNA might be the genetic material.\n\nSeveral researchers turned their efforts to elucidating the structure\nof DNA (Judson 1979: Ch. 2; Morange 2020: Ch.11; Olby 1974: Section\nV). Among them were James Watson (born 1928) and Francis Crick\n(1916\u20132004). They used data from DNA X-ray crystallography\nproduced by Maurice Wilkins (1916\u20132004), Rosalind Franklin\n(1920\u20131958), and co-workers, and adopted the style of reasoning\nand use of ball-and-stick models of molecules pioneered by Linus\nPauling (1901\u20131994). DNA was already known to consist of a\nsugar-phosphate structure and the four bases cytosine (C), guanine\n(G), adenine (A) or thymine (T). Based on additional evidence, Watson\nand Crick eventually came to consider a double helix model with the\nbases on the inside and a pairing of A with T and G with C, which was\npublished in April 1953. Shortly thereafter they published another\npaper which spelled out the consequences for genetics (Watson &\nCrick 1953a,b). The model suggested a mechanism of DNA replication\naccording to which the two chains of the DNA separate and each\nacquires a novel complementary strand on the basis of base pair\ncomplementarity. Hence it explained the previously postulated\nautocatalytic properties of genes. Seymour Benzer (1921\u20132007),\nworking with phage was able to push the resolution of genetic analysis\nto a level below the gene, by mapping mutation loci within genes\n(Holmes 2006). His work supported the DNA model as it showed that not\nonly genes, but also their components were arranged in a linear\nsequence and suggested that single bases could be the locus of\nmutation. Benzer concluded that the understanding of the classical\ngene as unit of mutation, recombination and function needed to be\nrevised (Benzer 1957). He suggested the novel terms\n\u201cmuton\u201d, \u201crecon\u201d and \u201ccistron,\u201d\nwhere only the latter gained some currency to refer to genes as units\nof function.\n\nThe acceptance of DNA as genetic material and of its structure brought\nthe search for the material basis of genes to an end. Subsequently,\nthe focus shifted on the question of how genes realized their\nheterocatalytic capacities. At this point, the question was reframed\nin terms of protein synthesis (Judson 1979: Ch. 6; Morange 2020: Ch.\n12). Proteins consist of one or several polypeptide chains, which are\ncomposed of amino acids. In the early 1950s, Frederick Sanger\n(1918\u20132013) had determined the amino acid sequence for\npolypeptides of insulin (Chadarevian 1996). On this basis, Crick\nre-defined the problem by observing that\n\n\n[t]he actual chemical step by which any two amino acids [\u2026] are\njoined together is probably always the same [\u2026].\n\n\nTherefore, the aspect of protein synthesis in need of explanation\nwas\n\n\nthat only a single standard set of twenty amino acids can be\nincorporated, and that for any particular protein the amino acids\nmust be joined up in the right order.\n\n\nIn other words, it was\n\n\nthe problem of \u201csequentialization\u201d. (Crick 1958: 144)\n\n\nIn response to this problem Crick formulated the sequence hypothesis,\nwhich assumed\n\n\nthat the specificity of a piece of nucleic acid [i.e., a stretch of\nDNA or RNA] is expressed solely by the sequence of its bases, and that\nthis sequence is a (simple) code for the amino acid sequence of a\nparticular protein. (1958: 152)\n\n\nThe three-dimensional conformation of the protein was then seen as\nemerging spontaneously as a function of its sequence. Additionally,\nCrick formulated what he called the \u201ccentral dogma\u201d,\nregarding the directionality of the relation of DNA\u2019s sequence\nof bases and proteins\u2019 sequence of amino acids:\n\n\n[The central dogma] states that once \u201cinformation\u201d has\npassed into protein it cannot get out again. In more detail,\nthe transfer of information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from\nnucleic acid to protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to\nprotein, or from protein to nucleic acid is impossible. (1958:\n153)\n\n\nThe language of \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201ccode\u201d had\nentered genetics only recently and from several sources. One was Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s (1887\u20131961) What is life?\n(1944), where he spoke of a \u201ccode-script\u201d; another was the\nbroader cold war techno-cultural context of cryptography, computer\nscience, and cybernetics (Kay 2000; Keller 2000). In this context,\nbefore the early 1960s, most authors treated the problem of the role\nof DNA in protein synthesis in a theoretical manner, relying on\nmathematical and cryptographic considerations, and using computers to\nsolve the combinatorial puzzle. Although some theoretical insights and\nmuch of the language developed at this time was important for later\ndevelopments, these attempts by geneticists were ultimately\nunsuccessful (Sarkar 1996; Stegmann 2021).\n\nBiochemists at the time were equally convinced that genes played an\nimportant role in protein synthesis (Judson 1979: Ch. 6 and 8; Morange\n2020: Ch. 12; Rheinberger 1997). New evidence emerged from the medical\ngenetics and biochemistry of sickle cell anemia, indicating the\nrelation of gene mutations and amino acid alterations, from in\nvitro systems of protein synthesis based on e.coli cell\nextracts, leading to the characterization of ribosomes and transfer\nRNA (tRNA), as well as from work establishing the existence and role\nof messenger RNA (mRNA) and its complementarity to DNA. The image that\nresulted from this diverse evidence was that mRNA transferred\ninformation from nuclear DNA to the cytoplasm, where ribosomes, as\nlargely unchanged structures, facilitated the assembly of amino acid\nchains based on the sequence of mRNA. In 1961, Crick and co-workers\nshowed experimentally that three bases code for one amino acid, that\ncoding triplets do not overlap and that they are read from a fixed\nstarting point. In the same year, Marshall Nirenberg (1927\u20132010)\nand Heinrich Matthaei (born 1929) published results from an experiment\nin which synthetic RNA consisting only of uracil bases (RNA contains\nuracil, instead of thymine) was introduced in a cell free protein\nsynthesis system, resulting in the production of a monotonous protein\nconsisting of the amino acid Phenylalanine. Thus, it was shown that\nthe RNA triplet UUU coded for this amino acid. This result opened the\npossibility to solve the genetic code experimentally and several labs\nparticipated in this project, leading to a complete table of\ncorrelated codons (coding triplets) and amino acids by 1967.\n",
