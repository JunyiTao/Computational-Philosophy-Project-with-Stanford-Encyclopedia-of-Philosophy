    "main_text": "\n\n\nWe are attuned in everyday conversation not primarily to the sentences\nwe utter to one another, but to the speech acts that those utterances\nare used to perform: requests, warnings, invitations, promises,\napologies, predictions, and the like. Such acts are staples of\ncommunicative life, but only became a topic of sustained\ninvestigation, at least in the English-speaking world, in the middle\nof the twentieth \ncentury.[1] \nSince that time \u201cspeech act theory\u201d has become influential\nnot only within philosophy, but also in linguistics, psychology, legal\ntheory, artificial intelligence, literary theory, and feminist thought\namong other scholarly \n disciplines.[2] \nRecognition of the significance of speech\nacts has illuminated the ability of language to do other things than\ndescribe reality. In the process the boundaries among the philosophy\nof language, the philosophy of action, aesthetics, the philosophy of\nmind, political philosophy, and ethics have become less sharp. In\naddition, an appreciation of speech acts has helped lay bare a\nnormative structure implicit in linguistic practice, including even\nthat part of this practice concerned with describing reality. Much\nrecent research aims at an accurate characterization of this normative\nstructure underlying linguistic practice.\n",
