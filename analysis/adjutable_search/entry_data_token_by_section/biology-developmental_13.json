For example, decomposing a system into its\nconstituents to understand the features manifested by the system\npromotes a dissection of the causal interactions of the localized\nconstituents, while downplaying interactions with elements external to\nthe system (Wimsatt 1980; Bechtel and Richardson 1993). Sometimes the\ndescriptive and explanatory practices of the sciences are successful\nprecisely because they intentionally ignore aspects of natural\nphenomena or use a variety of approximation techniques. Idealization\nis one type of reasoning strategy that scientists use to describe,\nmodel, and explain that purposefully departs from features known to be\npresent in nature. For example, the interior space of a cell is often\ndepicted as relatively empty even though intracellular space is known\nto be crowded (Ellis 2001); the variable of cellular volume takes on a\nvalue that is known to be false (i.e., relatively empty).\nIdealizations involve knowingly ignoring variations in properties or\nexcluding particular values for variables, in a variety of different\nways, for descriptive and explanatory purposes (Jones 2005; Weisberg\n2007).\n\n\u201cNormal development\u201d is conceptualized through strategies\nof abstraction that manage variation inherent within and across\ndeveloping organisms (Lowe 2015, 2016). The study of ontogeny in model\norganisms\n (Section 4)\n is usually executed by establishing a set of normal stages for\nembryonic development (see Other Internet Resources). A developmental\ntrajectory from fertilized zygote to fully-formed adult is broken down\ninto distinct temporal periods by reference to the occurrence of major\nevents, such as fertilization, gastrulation, or metamorphosis (Minelli\n2003: ch. 4; see\n Section 1.2).\n This enables researchers in different laboratory contexts to have\nstandardized comparisons of experimental results (Hopwood 2005, 2007).\nThey are critical to large communities of developmental biologists\nworking on well-established models, such as chick (Hamburger and\nHamilton 1951) or zebrafish (Kimmel et al. 1995): \u201cEmbryological\nresearch is now unimaginable without such standard series\u201d\n(Hopwood 2005: 239). These normal stages are a form of idealization\nbecause they intentionally ignore kinds of variation in development,\nincluding variation associated with environmental variables. While\nfacilitating the study of particular causal relationships, this means\nthat specific kinds of variation in developmental features that might\nbe relevant to evolution are minimized in the process of rendering\nontogeny experimentally tractable (Love 2010).\n\nPhenotypic plasticity is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon. It\ninvolves the capacity of a particular genotype to generate phenotypic\nvariation, often in the guise of qualitatively distinct phenotypes, in\nresponse to differential environmental cues (Pigliucci 2001; DeWitt\nand Scheiner 2004; Kaplan 2008; Gilbert and Epel 2009). One familiar\nexample is seasonal caterpillar morphs that depend on different\nnutritional sources (Greene 1989). Some of the relevant environmental\nvariables include temperature, nutrition, pressure/gravity, light,\npredators or stressful conditions, and population density (Gilbert and\nEpel 2009). The reaction norm is a summary of the range of\nphenotypes, whether quantitatively or qualitatively varying, exhibited\nby organisms of a given genotype for different environmental\nconditions. When the reaction norm exhibits discontinuous variation or\nbivalent phenotypes (rather than quantitative, continuous variation),\nit is often labeled a polyphenism\n (Figure 7).\n\n\n\nFigure 7: A color polyphenism in\nAmerican Peppered Moth caterpillars that represents an example of\nphenotypic plasticity.\n\n\nPhenotypic plasticity has been of recurring interest to biological\nresearchers and controversial in evolutionary theory. Extensive study\nof phenotypic plasticity has occurred in the context of quantitative\ngenetic methods and phenotypic selection analyses, where the extent of\nplasticity in natural populations has been demonstrated and\noperational measures delineated for its detection (Scheiner 1993;\nPigliucci 2001). Other aspects of plasticity require different\ninvestigative methods to ascertain the sources of plasticity during\nontogeny, the molecular genetic mechanisms that encourage plasticity,\nand the kinds of mapping functions that exist between the genotype and\nphenotype (Pigliucci 2001; Kirschner and Gerhart 2005: ch. 5). These\nlatter aspects, the origin of phenotypic variation during and after\nontogeny, are in view at the intersection of development and\nevolution: How do molecular genetic mechanisms produce (or reduce)\nplasticity? What genotype-phenotype mapping functions are prevalent or\nrare? Does plasticity contribute to the origination of evolutionary\nnovelties (Moczek et al. 2011; West-Eberhard 2003)?\n\nIn order to evaluate these questions experimentally, researchers need\nto alter development through the manipulation of environmental\nvariables and observe how a novel phenotype can be established within\nthe existing plasticity of an organism (Kirschner and Gerhart 2005:\nch. 5). This manipulation could allow for the identification of\npatterns of variation through the reliable replication of particular\nexperimental alterations within different environmental regimes.\nHowever, without measuring variation across different environmental\nregimes, you cannot observe phenotypic plasticity. These measurements\nare required to document the degree of plasticity and its patterns for\na particular trait, such as qualitatively distinct morphs. An\nevaluation of the significance of phenotypic plasticity for evolution\nrequires answers to questions about where plasticity emerges, how\nmolecular genetic mechanisms are involved in the plasticity, and what\ngenotype-phenotype relations obtain.\n\nDevelopmental stages intentionally ignore variation associated with\nphenotypic plasticity. Animals and plants are raised under stable\nenvironmental conditions so that stages can be reproduced in different\nlaboratory settings and variation is often viewed as noise that must\nbe reduced or eliminated if one is to understand how development works\n(Frankino and Raff 2004). This practice also encourages the selection\nof model organisms that exhibit less plasticity (Bolker 1995). The\nlaboratory domestication of a model organism may also reduce the\namount or type of observable phenotypic variation (Gu et al. 2005),\nthough laboratory domestication also can increase variation (e.g., via\ninbreeding). Despite attempts to reduce variation by controlling\nenvironmental factors, some of it always remains (Lowe 2015) and is\ndisplayed by the fact that absolute chronology is not a reliable\nmeasure of time in ontogeny, and neither is the initiation or\ncompletion of its different parts (Mabee et al. 2000; Sheil and\nGreenbaum 2005). Developmental stages allow this recalcitrant\nvariation to be effectively ignored by judgments of embryonic\ntypicality. Normal stages also involve assumptions about the causal\nconnections between different processes across sequences of stages\n(Minelli 2003: ch. 4). Once these stages have been constructed, it is\npossible to use them as a visual standard against which to recognize\nand describe variation as a deviation from the norm (DiTeresi 2010;\nLowe 2016). But, more typically, variation ignored in the construction\nof these stages is also ignored in the routine consultation of the\nstages in day-to-day research contexts (Frankino and Raff 2004).\n\nNormal stages fulfill a number of goals related to descriptive and\nexplanatory endeavors that developmental biologists engage in (Kimmel\net al. 1995). They yield a way to measure experimental replication,\nenable consistent and unambiguous communication among researchers,\nespecially if stages are founded on commonly observable morphological\nfeatures, facilitate accurate predictions of developmental phenomena,\nand aid in making comparisons or generalizations across species. As\nidealizations of ontogeny, normal stages allow for a classification of\ndevelopmental events that is comprehensive with suitably sized and\nrelatively homogeneous stages, reasonably sharp boundaries between\nstages, and stability under different investigative conditions\n(Dupr\u00e9 2001), which encourages more precise explanations within\nparticular disciplinary approaches (Griesemer 1996). Idealizations\nalso can facilitate abstraction and generalization, both of which are\na part of extrapolating findings from the investigative context of a\nmodel organism to other domains (Steel 2008; see\n Section 4\n and\n 5.1).\n\nThere are various weaknesses associated with normal stages that\naccompany the fulfillment of these investigative and explanatory\ngoals. Key morphological indicators sometimes overlap stages,\nterminology that is useful for one purpose may be misleading for\nanother, particular terms can be misleading in cross-species\ncomparisons, and manipulation of the embryo for continued observation\ncan have a causal impact on ontogeny. Avoiding variability in stage\nindicators can encourage overlooking the significance of this\nvariation, or at least provide a reason to favor its minimization.\n\nThus, there are good reasons for adopting normal stages to periodize\nmodel organism ontogeny, and these reasons help to explain why their\ncontinued use yields empirical success. However, similar to other\nstandard (successful) practices in science, normal stages are often\ntaken for granted, which means their biasing effects are neglected\n(Wimsatt 1980), some of which are relevant to evolutionary questions\n(e.g., systematically underestimating the extent of variation in a\npopulation). This is critical to recognize because the success of a\nperiodization is not a function of the eventual ability to relax the\nidealizations; periodizations are not slowly corrected so that they\nbecome less idealized. Instead, new periodizations are constructed and\nused alongside the existing ones because different idealizations\ninvolve different judgments of typicality that serve diverse\ndescriptive and explanatory aims. In addition to the systematic biases\ninvolved in developmental staging, most model organisms are poorly\nsuited to inform us about how environmental effects modulate or\ncombine with genetic or other factors in development\u2014they make\nit difficult to discover details about mechanisms underlying reaction\nnorms. Short generation times and rapid development are tightly\ncorrelated with insensitivity to environmental conditions through\nvarious mechanisms such as prepatterning (Bolker 1995).\n\nThe tension between the specific practice of developmental staging in\nmodel organisms and uncovering the relevance of variation due to\nphenotypic plasticity for evolution can be reconstructed as an\nargument.\n\nVariation due to phenotypic plasticity is a normal feature of\nontogeny.\nThe developmental staging of model organisms intentionally\ndownplays variation in ontogeny associated with the effects of\nenvironmental variables (e.g., phenotypic plasticity) by strictly\nlimiting the range of values for environmental variables and by\nremoving variation in characters utilized to establish the\ncomprehensive periodization.\nTherefore, using model organisms with specified developmental\nstages will make it difficult, if not impossible, to observe patterns\nof variation due to phenotypic plasticity.\n\n\nAlthough this tension obtains even if the focus is not on evolutionary\nquestions, sometimes encouraging developmental biologists to interpret\nabsence of evidence as evidence of the developmental insignificance of\nphenotypic plasticity, it is exacerbated for evolutionary researchers.\nThe documentation of patterns of variation is precisely what is\nrequired to gauge the evolutionary significance of phenotypic\nplasticity. Practices of developmental staging in model organisms can\nretard our ability to make either a positive or negative assessment.\nDevelopmental staging, in conjunction with the properties of model\norganisms, tends to encourage a negative assessment of the\nevolutionary importance of phenotypic plasticity because the variation\nis not manifested and documented, and therefore is unlikely to be\nreckoned as substantive. Idealizations involving normal stages\ndiscourage a robust experimental probing of phenotypic plasticity,\nwhich is an obstacle to determining its evolutionary significance.\n\nThe consequences of this tension for the intersection of development\nand evolution are two-fold. First, the most powerful experimental\nsystems for studying development are set up to minimize variation that\nmay be critical to comprehending how evolutionary processes occur in\nnature. Second, if evolutionary investigations revolve around a\ncharacter that was assessed for typicality to underwrite the temporal\npartitions that we call stages, then much of the variation in this\ncharacter was conceptually removed as a part of rendering the model\norganism experimentally\n tractable.[21]\n\nThe identification of drawbacks that accompany strategies of\nidealization used to study development invites consideration of ways\nto address the liabilities identified (Love 2006). We can construct a\nprincipled perspective on how to address these liabilities by adding\nthree further premises:\n\nReasoning strategies involving idealization, such as (2), are\nnecessary to the successful prosecution of biological investigations\nof ontogeny.\nTherefore, compensatory tactics should be chosen in such a way as\nto specifically redress the blind spots arising from the kind of\nidealizations utilized.\nGiven (1)\u2013(3), compensatory tactics must be related to the\neffects of ignoring variation due to phenotypic plasticity that result\nfrom the developmental staging of model organisms.\n\n\nAt least two compensatory tactics can promote observations of\nvariation due to phenotypic plasticity that is ignored when\ndevelopmental stages are constructed for model organisms: the\nemployment of diverse model organisms and the adoption of alternate\nperiodizations.\n\nVariation often will be observable in non-standard model organisms\nbecause experimental organisms that do not have large communities\nbuilt around them are less likely to have had their embryonic\ndevelopment formally staged, and thus the effects of idealization on\nphenotypic plasticity are not operative. In turn, researchers are\nsensitized to the ways in which these kinds of variation are being\nmuted in the study of standard models. Stages can be used then as\nvisual standards to identify variation as deviations from a norm and\nthereby characterize patterns of\n variability.[22]\n\nA second compensatory tactic is the adoption of alternative\nperiodizations. This involves choosing different characters to\nconstruct new temporal partitions, thereby facilitating the\nobservation of variation with respect to characteristics previously\nstabilized in the normal stage periodization. These alternative\nperiodizations often divide a subset of developmental events according\nto processes or landmarks that differ from those used to construct the\nnormal stages, and they may not map one-one onto the existing normal\nstages, especially if they encompass events beyond the trajectory from\nfertilization to a sexually mature adult. This lack of isomorphism\nbetween periodizations also will be manifested if different measures\nof time are utilized, whether sequence (event ordering) or duration\n(succession of defined intervals), and whether sequences or durations\nare measured relative to one another or against an external standard,\nsuch as absolute chronology (Reiss 2003; Colbert and Rowe 2008). These\nincompatibilities prevent assimilating the alternative periodizations\ninto a single, overarching staging scheme. In all of these cases,\nidealization is involved and therefore each new periodization is\nsubject to the liabilities of ignoring kinds of variation. However,\nalternative periodizations require choosing different characters to\nstabilize and typify when defining its temporal partitions, which\nmeans different kinds of variation will be exposed than were\npreviously\n observable.[23]\n\nThe compensatory tactics of employing a diversity of model organisms\nand adopting alternative periodizations may be conceptually\nappropriate for addressing how the practice of developmental staging\nhas an impact on the detection of phenotypic plasticity, but this does\nnot remove associated costs (human, financial, and otherwise) or\ncontroversy. The advantages of a single, comprehensive periodization\nfor a general model organism (e.g., zebrafish normal stages) must be\nweighed in light of the advantages of alternative, process-specific\nperiodizations. However, by openly scrutinizing these practices in\nrelation to the phenomenon of interest and recognizing both advantages\nand drawbacks involved in the idealizations utilized, developmental\nand evolutionary biologists are better positioned to offer systematic\ndescriptions and comprehensive explanations of biological\nphenomena.\n",
