    "main_text": "\n\nIdeas are among the most important items in Descartes\u2019\nphilosophy. They serve to unify his ontology and epistemology. As he\nsays in a letter to Guillaume Gibieuf (1583\u20131650), dated 19\nJanuary 1642, \u201cI am certain that I can have no knowledge of what\nis outside me except by means of the ideas I have within\n me.\u201d[1]\n Descartes never published anything that specifically worked out a\ntheory of ideas. Even so, he said enough in published and unpublished\nwork, as well as in correspondence, that allows for a basic\nreconstruction of a theory. This entry will focus principally on the\ntheory of ideas and how it relates to Descartes\u2019 ontology,\nthough in Section 6 of this entry, which includes discussion of simple\nnatures and Descartes\u2019 concepts of clarity and distinctness,\ncertain components of his epistemology are briefly considered. For\nmore on the epistemology, see the related entry\n Descartes, Ren\u00e9: epistemology.\n",
