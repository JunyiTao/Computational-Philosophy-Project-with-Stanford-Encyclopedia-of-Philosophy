Political and Social Thought\n\n With the progress of the critical edition of Marchia\u2019s\nSentences commentary, we are beginning to appreciate more\nfully his thought in philosophical theology and natural\nphilosophy. Investigating where Marchia stands in political theory has\nbeen much easier due to Mariani\u2019s publication of the\nImprobatio some fourteen years ago (Marchia 1993), probably\nwritten in the beginning of 1330. While the nature of the relationship\nbetween societal factors, on the one hand, and science and\nphilosophical theology, on the other, has long been a subject of\ncontroversy, it is clear that political thought is closely tied to the\ncircumstances of the thinker. As in the case of Ockham, circumstances\ndrove Marchia into opposition to Pope John XXII. Unlike Ockham,\nhowever, Marchia had dealt with some issues of social and political\nphilosophy in the early 1320s in book IV of his Sentences\ncommentary. In the tense climate of the struggle against Pope John at\nthe end of the decade, when Marchia\u2019s writings focused on more worldly\naffairs, he made some subtle modifications to serve his new aims\n(Lambertini 2006b). The group of scholars supporting the ex-minister\ngeneral of the Franciscans Michael of Cesena gathered at Louis of\nBavaria\u2019s court in Munich and collaborated on their anti-John XXII\ntracts. It has been shown that Marchia\u2019s Improbatio\ninfluenced Ockham\u2019s Opus nonaginta dierum (Miethke 1969;\nLambertini 2000, 2003, 2006a, 2006b) and most probably the Cesena\ngroup\u2019s Appellatio magna monacensis (Lambertini 2001). Thus,\nas in philosophical theology and natural philosophy, Marchia had an\nhistorical impact.\n\n\nThe Franciscans maintained that they lived the most perfect life\nthat was humanly possible, following the model of Christ and the\napostles who, they claimed, possessed nothing either as individuals or\nin common. John XXII not only denied that Christ and the apostles had\nno possessions, but he also declared the Franciscan position to be\nheretical. The resulting quarrel came to touch on such issues as usury,\nownership of property, disposal of property, natural and divine law and\nrights, papal infallibility, and ultimately the basis of\nsovereignty.\n\n\nOn the question on dominion, or possession, of property, Marchia\naccepted the pope\u2019s assertion that, even in the state of nature before\nthe fall, Adam had dominion over the things he used, but Marchia denied\nthat this type of dominion had much at all in common with\npost-lapsarian dominion: they are alterius generis, differing\nlike violent and natural, like corruptible and incorruptible\n(Lambertini 2000, VII). Before the fall, Adam had \u201cdominion of natural\nliberty and perfection,\u201d according to the \u201cprimaeval natural law\u201d;\nafterwards, although Marchia admitted that there was a \u201cremnant of\nnatural law,\u201d basically it had to be replaced by positive law and the\ndominion of \u201cservile necessity\u201d and the \u201cpower of compulsion.\u201d This is\nbecause, if left to his own devices, post-lapsarian man would grab all\nhe could get.\n\n\nMarchia describes the situation in the state of nature thus:\nIn the state of nature all things had been common to all\npeople, not only with respect to the dominion of things but also with\nrespect to use, whether de iure or de facto \u2014\nwith respect to use de iure because the right of using whatever was\nsuitable to them had been common to all and proper to none. (Marchia\n1993, pp. 154\u20135)\n\n Moreover, even before the creation of Eve, Adam had no dominion over\nthings that was \u201cproper\u201d to him. Therefore Pope John erred in claiming\nthat the eventual \u201cdivision of things\u201d into private possessions\nstemmed from divine law, since it came from human or positive law,\nnecessitated by human iniquity. The first division, by human law,\noccurred already with Cain and Abel before the Flood. Of course God\nrestored common dominion to Noah and his sons with the Deluge, but\nhumans and human law soon reinstated the division of goods. This was\nnot by divine will, for \u201cwhen they began to build the tower [of Babel]\nit was by human counsel, not by divine \u2014 indeed God was not\npleased.\u201d By extension, the laws of emperors and princes derive from\nhuman law, not divine, with the exception of Hebrew law in the time\nbefore Christ, a special status lost at the crucifixion.\n\n\nThe upshot is that private property is not divinely instituted, for\nMarchia: it is a human introduction. In the state of nature, by divine\nlaw, humans had a common \u201cdominion\u201d over goods, but this dominion is\nnot at all the dominion of human law, of private property. Moreover, it\nis this common dominion that Christ and the apostles followed. It is\ntherefore humanly possible to do so, indeed the best possible way to\nlive, and the Franciscans approached it more closely than anyone\nelse.\n\n\nOn the question of ecclesiastical power, of course, Marchia was also\nin disagreement with Pope John XXII (Lambertini 2000, IX). In order to\ndefend Christ\u2019s poverty and that of the Franciscans by extension,\nMarchia interpreted Christ\u2019s remark to Pilate that \u201cmy kingdom is not\nof this world\u201d as meaning not only that the origins of his kingdom and\nthe source of his power are not of this world, but also that his\nkingdom and his power are not with respect to the things of this world.\nIndeed, for Marchia, Caesar had legitimate sovereignty over this world.\nMarchia thus denied that Christ, as a man, possessed any temporal\npower, and hence he rejected John XXII\u2019s claim that Christ was\nrex and dominus in a temporal sense. The implication\nis that the pope could not inherit temporal power over the entire\nearth, although Marchia admitted that the temporal sword could pertain\nto the pope indirectly and mediately.\n\n\nGiven that the few historical surveys that have been done demonstrate\nthat Marchia had an impact on his successors in many areas of\nphilosophical thought, and given that it is only in the past twenty-five\nyears that any substantial part of his works has been available in\nprint, we can expect the flood of investigations of the ideas of this\ninteresting and important scholastic thinker to continue.\n",
