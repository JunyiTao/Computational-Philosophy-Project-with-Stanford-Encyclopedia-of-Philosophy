She\nformulates three requirements that an analogical argument must satisfy\nin order to be acceptable:\n\nRequirement of material analogy. The horizontal relations\nmust include similarities between observable properties.\nCausal condition. The vertical relations must be causal\nrelations \u201cin some acceptable scientific sense\u201d (1966:\n87).\nNo-essential-difference condition. The essential\nproperties and causal relations of the source domain must not have\nbeen shown to be part of the negative analogy.\n\n3.3.1 Requirement of material analogy\n\nFor Hesse, an acceptable analogical argument must include\n\u201cobservable similarities\u201d between domains, which she\nrefers to as material analogy. Material analogy is contrasted\nwith formal analogy. Two domains are formally analogous if\nboth are \u201cinterpretations of the same formal theory\u201d\n(1966: 68). Nomic isomorphism (Hempel 1965) is a special case\nin which the physical laws governing two systems have identical\nmathematical form. Heat and fluid flow exhibit nomic isomorphism. A\nsecond example is the analogy between the flow of electric current in\na wire and fluid in a pipe. Ohm\u2019s law \n\n\\[\\tag{6}\n\\Delta v = iR\n\\]\n\n\nstates that voltage difference along a wire equals current times a\nconstant resistance. This has the same mathematical form as\nPoiseuille\u2019s law (for ideal fluids): \n\n\\[\\tag{7}\n\\Delta p = \\dot{V}k\n\\]\n\n\nwhich states that the pressure difference along a pipe equals the\nvolumetric flow rate times a constant. Both of these systems can be\nrepresented by a common equation. While formal analogy is linked to\ncommon mathematical structure, it should not be limited to nomic\nisomorphism (Bartha 2010: 209). The idea of formal analogy generalizes\nto cases where there is a common mathematical structure between\nmodels for two systems. Bartha offers an even more liberal\ndefinition (2010: 195): \u201cTwo features are formally similar if\nthey occupy corresponding positions in formally analogous theories.\nFor example, pitch in the theory of sound corresponds to color in the\ntheory of light.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, material analogy consists of what Hesse calls\n\u201cobservable\u201d or \u201cpre-theoretic\u201d similarities.\nThese are horizontal relationships of similarity between properties of\nobjects in the source and the target. Similarities between echoes\n(sound) and reflection (light), for instance, were recognized long\nbefore we had any detailed theories about these phenomena. Hesse\n(1966, 1988) regards such similarities as metaphorical relationships\nbetween the two domains and labels them \u201cpre-theoretic\u201d\nbecause they draw on personal and cultural experience. We have both\nmaterial and formal analogies between sound and light, and it is\nsignificant for Hesse that the former are independent of the\nlatter.\n\nThere are good reasons not to accept Hesse\u2019s requirement of\nmaterial analogy, construed in this narrow way. First, it is apparent\nthat formal analogies are the starting point in many\nimportant inferences. That is certainly the case in mathematics, a\nfield in which material analogy, in Hesse\u2019s sense, plays no role\nat all. Analogical arguments based on formal analogy have also been\nextremely influential in physics (Steiner 1989, 1998).\n\nIn Norton\u2019s broad sense, however, \u2018material analogy\u2019\nsimply refers to similarities rooted in factual knowledge of the\nsource and target domains. With reference to this broader meaning,\nHesse proposes two additional material criteria.\n3.3.2 Causal condition\n\nHesse requires that the hypothetical analogy, the feature transferred\nto the target domain, be causally related to the positive\nanalogy. In her words, the essential requirement for a good argument\nfrom analogy is \u201ca tendency to co-occurrence\u201d, i.e., a\ncausal relationship. She states the requirement as follows:\n\n\nThe vertical relations in the model [source] are causal relations in\nsome acceptable scientific sense, where there are no compelling a\npriori reasons for denying that causal relations of the same kind may\nhold between terms of the explanandum [target]. (1966: 87)\n\n\nThe causal condition rules out analogical arguments where there is no\ncausal knowledge of the source domain. It derives support from the\nobservation that many analogies do appear to involve a transfer of\ncausal knowledge.\n\nThe causal condition is on the right track, but is arguably too\nrestrictive. For example, it rules out analogical arguments in\nmathematics. Even if we limit attention to the empirical sciences,\npersuasive analogical arguments may be founded upon strong statistical\ncorrelation in the absence of any known causal connection.\nConsider\n (Example 11)\n Benjamin Franklin\u2019s prediction, in 1749, that pointed metal\nrods would attract lightning, by analogy with the way they attracted\nthe \u201celectrical fluid\u201d in the laboratory:\n\n\nElectrical fluid agrees with lightning in these particulars: 1. Giving\nlight. 2. Colour of the light. 3. Crooked direction. 4. Swift motion.\n5. Being conducted by metals. 6. Crack or noise in exploding. 7.\nSubsisting in water or ice. 8. Rending bodies it passes through. 9.\nDestroying animals. 10. Melting metals. 11. Firing inflammable\nsubstances. 12. Sulphureous smell.\u2014The electrical fluid is\nattracted by points.\u2014We do not know whether this property is in\nlightning.\u2014But since they agree in all the particulars wherein\nwe can already compare them, is it not probable they agree likewise in\nthis? Let the experiment be made. (Benjamin Franklin\u2019s\nExperiments, 334)\n\n\nFranklin\u2019s hypothesis was based on a long list of properties\ncommon to the target (lightning) and source (electrical fluid in the\nlaboratory). There was no known causal connection between the twelve\n\u201cparticulars\u201d and the thirteenth property, but there was a\nstrong correlation. Analogical arguments may be plausible even where\nthere are no known causal relations.\n3.3.3 No-essential-difference condition\n\nHesse\u2019s final requirement is that the \u201cessential\nproperties and causal relations of the [source] have not been shown to\nbe part of the negative analogy\u201d (1966: 91). Hesse does not\nprovide a definition of \u201cessential,\u201d but suggests that a\nproperty or relation is essential if it is \u201ccausally closely\nrelated to the known positive analogy.\u201d For instance, an analogy\nwith fluid flow was extremely influential in developing the theory of\nheat conduction. Once it was discovered that heat was not conserved,\nhowever, the analogy became unacceptable (according to Hesse) because\nconservation was so central to the theory of fluid flow.\n\nThis requirement, though once again on the right track, seems too\nrestrictive. It can lead to the rejection of a good analogical\nargument. Consider the analogy between a two-dimensional rectangle and\na three-dimensional box\n (Example 7).\n Broadening Hesse\u2019s notion, it seems that there are many\n\u2018essential\u2019 differences between rectangles and boxes. This\ndoes not mean that we should reject every analogy between rectangles\nand boxes out of hand. The problem derives from the fact that\nHesse\u2019s condition is applied to the analogy relation\nindependently of the use to which that relation is put. What counts as\nessential should vary with the analogical argument. Absent an\ninferential context, it is impossible to evaluate the importance or\n\u2018essentiality\u2019 of similarities and differences.\n\nDespite these weaknesses, Hesse\u2019s \u2018material\u2019\ncriteria constitute a significant advance in our understanding of\nanalogical reasoning. The causal condition and the\nno-essential-difference condition incorporate local factors, as urged\nby Norton, into the assessment of analogical arguments. These\nconditions, singly or taken together, imply that an analogical\nargument can fail to generate any support for its conclusion, even\nwhen there is a non-empty positive analogy. Hesse offers no theory\nabout the \u2018degree\u2019 of analogical support. That makes her\naccount one of the few that is oriented towards the modal, rather than\nprobabilistic, use of analogical arguments\n (\u00a72.3).\n",
