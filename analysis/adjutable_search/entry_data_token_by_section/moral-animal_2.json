    "main_text": "The Moral Considerability of Animals || Human Exceptionalism\n1.2 Human Exceptionalism\n\nLike speciesism, human exceptionalism can be understood in different\nways. The most common way of understanding it is to suggest that there\nare distinctly human capacities and it is on the basis of these\ncapacities that humans have moral status and other animals do not. But\nwhich capacities mark out all and only humans as the kinds of beings\nthat can be wronged? A number of candidate capacities have been\nproposed\u2014developing family ties, solving social problems,\nexpressing emotions, starting wars, having sex for pleasure, using\nlanguage, or thinking abstractly, are just a few. As it turns out,\nnone of these activities is uncontroversially unique to human. Both\nscholarly and popular work on animal behavior suggests that many of\nthe activities that are thought to be distinct to humans occurs in\nnon-humans. For example, many species of non-humans develop long\nlasting kinship ties\u2014orangutan mothers stay with their young for\neight to ten years and while they eventually part company, they\ncontinue to maintain their relationships. Less solitary animals, such\nas chimpanzees, baboons, wolves, and elephants maintain extended\nfamily units built upon complex individual relationships, for long\nperiods of time. Meerkats in the Kalahari desert are known to\nsacrifice their own safety by staying with sick or injured family\nmembers so that the fatally ill will not die alone. All animals living\nin socially complex groups must solve various problems that inevitably\narise in such groups. Canids and primates are particularly adept at\nit, yet even chickens and horses are known to recognize large numbers\nof individuals in their social hierarchies and to maneuver within\nthem. One of the ways that non-human animals negotiate their social\nenvironments is by being particularly attentive to the emotional\nstates of others around them. When a conspecific is angry, it is a\ngood idea to get out of his way. Animals that develop life-long bonds\nare known to suffer from the death of their partners. Some are even\nsaid to die of sorrow. Darwin reported this in The Descent of\nMan: \u201cSo intense is the grief of female monkeys for the\nloss of their young, that it invariably caused the death of certain\nkinds\u201d (1871: 40). Jane Goodall\u2019s report of the death of\nthe healthy 8 year old chimpanzee Flint just three weeks after the\ndeath of his mother Flo also suggests that sorrow can have a\ndevastating effect on non-human animals (see Goodall 2000:\n140\u2013141 in Bekoff 2000). Coyotes, elephants and killer whales\nare also among the species for which profound effects of grief have\nbeen reported (Bekoff 2000) and many dog owners can provide similar\naccounts. While the lives of many, perhaps most, non-humans in the\nwild are consumed with struggle for survival, aggression and battle,\nthere are some non-humans whose lives are characterized by expressions\nof joy, playfulness, and a great deal of sex (Woods 2010). Recent\nstudies in cognitive ethology have suggested that some non-humans\nengage in manipulative and deceptive activity, can construct\n\u201ccognitive maps\u201d for navigation, and some non-humans\nappear to understand symbolic representation and are able to use\n language.[1]\n\nIt appears that most of the capacities that are thought to distinguish\nhumans as morally considerable beings, have been observed, often in\nless elaborate form, in the non-human world. Because human behavior\nand cognition share deep roots with the behavior and cognition of\nother animals, approaches that try to find sharp behavioral or\ncognitive boundaries between humans and other animals remain\ncontroversial. For this reason, attempts to establish human uniqueness\nby identifying certain capacities, are not the most promising when it\ncomes to thinking hard about the moral status of animals.\n",
