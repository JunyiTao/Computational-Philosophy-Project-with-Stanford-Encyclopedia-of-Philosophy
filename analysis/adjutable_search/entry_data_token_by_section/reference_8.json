Definite Descriptions\n\nIn contrast to the sorts of terms we have considered so far, the\nprimary question regarding definite descriptions\u2014complex\nexpressions like \u2018the biscuit\u2019 or \u2018the\noff-license\u2019\u2014is not how they refer, but whether they\nrefer at all.\n\nBoth Meinong (1904) and Frege (1892) thought that they did. That left\nthem with a problem, however, since the overt descriptive material\nfound in definite descriptions is typically insufficient to identify a\nsingle object as the referent. For Frege, at least, there was a fairly\nobvious solution: treat that overt descriptive material as just a part\nof the sense of the definite description, allowing more material to be\nadded by whatever fuller description the speaker happens to have in\nmind. Faced with this same set of issues, Russell (1905) took the\nopposite tack: he posited that descriptions simply do not refer.\nRather, what he offered was a translation procedure for sentences of\nthe form \u2018The A is B\u2019, which he posited to mean: there is\none and only one A, and that A is also\n B.[13]\n\nThis dispute becomes even more interesting when one considers that\nboth Russell and Frege agreed that names were to be\nunderstood as, in some sense, akin to definite descriptions. Now we\nare in a better position to see the deep differences between them, in\nspite of this superficial agreement. For Frege, that claim in no way\nprevented names from being genuine devices of reference. For Russell,\nit did. For Frege, a name\u2019s contribution to the truth or falsity of a\nsentence was (intensional contexts to the side) its referent. For\nRussell, it was the associated description.\n\nWhy suppose that definite descriptions fail to refer? After all, we\ncertainly seem to use them to talk about particular objects;\nwhen I say \u201cI want the sloop to the right of that one,\u201d I\nseem to be expressing a desire to possess a particular sloop, not just\na desire to be relieved from slooplessness in some complicated\nfashion. What\u2019s more, we can substitute definite descriptions for\nnames and indexicals in most linguistic contexts. Naively then, it\nmight seem reasonable to posit that, if names and indexicals refer,\nthen so too do token definite descriptions. Russell, however, did not\nlack for motivation in his claim that definite descriptions fail to\nrefer. Consider assertive utterances of the following sentences:\n\nThe King of France is bald.\nThe author of Middlemarch is the third child of Robert\nand Christiana Evans.\n\n\n(11) is meaningful, and certainly not true. Russell takes it to be\nplainly false, though that is controversial (see Strawson (1950) and,\nmore recently, Von Fintel (2004)). Regardless, if one thinks that\ndefinite descriptions are devices of reference, then it\u2019s unclear how\none will be justified in claiming that sentences like (11) are\nmeaningful. After all, the description clearly doesn\u2019t refer. With\n(12), the problem facing the referentialist is different: since both\nthese descriptions should refer to the same individual, Mary Ann Evans\n(or \u2018George Eliot\u2019), it becomes highly unclear why (12)\nshouldn\u2019t be knowable apriori. As with identity statements\ninvolving co-referring names, this looks to be merely an instance of\nthe law of self-identity.\n\nNote that Russell\u2019s theory, in contrast, has no difficulty explaining\nany of this. (11) just makes a claim about there being a unique king\nof France, a claim which is both perfectly meaningful and\nstraightforwardly false. (12), on the other hand, makes a claim about\nthe unique satisfier of one set of properties also uniquely satisfying\nanother set of properties. That should hardly ever count as knowable\napriori.\n\nStill, there are also reasons to question Russell\u2019s claim that\ndefinite descriptions fail to refer. For instance, as Strawson (1950)\npointed out, many assertive utterances involving definite descriptions\nwill seem true even when the relevant description fails to have a\nunique satisfier. So, consider:\n\nThe table is covered with books.\n\n\nAssertively uttered in a context where there is a single table stacked\nhigh with books, (13) would seem to be true. Yet Russell predicts the\nopposite, so long as there is at least one additional table somewhere\nor other in the universe. Strawson\u2019s alternative was to claim that\nthere are genuinely referential uses of definite\ndescriptions. Used in this way, definite descriptions will, like names\nand indexicals, contribute an object or individual to the content\nasserted by the utterance\u2014so long, that is, as that object\nsatisfies the relevant descriptive material. Otherwise, such tokens\nwill still count as meaningful in virtue of being associated with\ncoherent rules of use, but they will fail to refer. That, Strawson\nclaims, means that the assertive utterances of which they are a part\nwill fail to be either true or false. The contrasting category here is\nof a attributive use of a definite description, which is\nsupposed to function more or less as Russell suggested.\n\nKeith Donnellan (1966) went even further than Strawson, claiming that\ndefinite descriptions can be used to refer even when the putative\nreferent fails to satisfy the descriptive material explicit in the\ndescription itself. In what is probably his most famous example,\nDonnellan asks us to consider an utterance of the following:\n\nWho is the man drinking the martini?\n\n\nSuppose that we are both looking at a man who appears to be drinking a\nmartini, but is in fact drinking water, when you utter (14). On\nDonnellan\u2019s telling, this is irrelevant; the token description\n\u2018the man drinking the martini\u2019 can refer to this man in\nour visual field regardless of whether he is in fact drinking a\nmartini. What matters, according to Donnellan, is just that you\nhave this man \u2018in mind\u2019 when using the relevant\ndescription, that you use the description with this man as your\nintended target.\n\nOne might worry, as did Alfred MacKay (1968), that this means that\nDonnellan is open to the charge of offering a Humpty Dumpty view of\ndefinite descriptions\u2014one on which there are no substantive\nconstraints on what token descriptions can be used to refer to.\nInterestingly, Donnellan (1968)\u2019s response was to appeal to the\nGricean theory of meaning, thus raising the possibility that what he\nmeant by \u2018having in mind\u2019 is something akin to the\nGricean\u2019s notion of having a referential intention. As we saw above,\nhowever, there is reason to think that even this sort of move won\u2019t\nsuffice to head off the collapse of intentionalism into Humpty\nDumpty-ism in a fully general sense. So there is still reason to be\nconcerned that Donnellan\u2019s willingness to jettison the explicit\ndescriptive material as a constraint on referential success is perhaps\na bridge too far.\n\nBut what of the intuitions behind Donnellan\u2019s example? For, even if we\nreject his claim that a description like \u2018the F\u2019\ncan be used to refer to something that isn\u2019t an F, it still\nseems as though communication is possible in a case like (14). That\nis, I should be able to tell who you\u2019re asking about regardless of\nwhether I know that this man is drinking a water rather than a\nmartini. Kripke (1977) suggested that the way to deal with cases like\nthese is to view the sort of reference involved as merely pragmatic,\nas having to do with communicative efficacy rather than with the sort\nof strict aboutness relevant to determining truth or falsity in a\ncontext. According to Kripke, there is no need to posit that definite\ndescriptions ever refer; instead, we can explain away their\napparent referential properties by noting that, even if they do not\nrefer, speakers will typically have targets in mind for them to latch\nonto nonetheless. So long as we are reasonably good at recovering\nthose targets, we can use them to direct each other\u2019s thought to\nparticular objects without needing to posit that token instances of\nthese expressions themselves ever manage to lock onto those objects\nand individuals. In other words, we are free to accept the Russellian\ntheory of descriptions, supplemented with this claim that descriptions\nare very often used to direct listeners\u2019 attention to the\n\u2018speaker\u2019s referent\u2019, as Kripke called what he took to be\nthe referential analogue of Gricean \u2018speaker\u2019s meaning\u2019\n(or, roughly, whatever the speaker is trying to get across to the\nlistener, literally or otherwise).\n\nKripke seems to have in mind that genuine linguistic reference\u2014or\nwhat he calls \u2018semantic reference\u2019\u2014needs to run\npurely via convention. His paradigm example is names, which he takes\nto be associated with a convention to the effect that their reference\nis fixed via an appeal to causal chains. Alternatively, he might have\npointed to Kaplan\u2019s character-based approach to the pure indexicals, a\nview which is equally reliant on conventions to establish reference.\nAs we saw above, however, there are plausibly limits to\nthis sort of approach: a conventionalist approach to the reference of\nimpure indexicals, like demonstratives and pronouns, has not been\nforthcoming. Likewise, once we take seriously the problem of names\nwith multiple bearers, it becomes far less clear that the reference of\ntoken uses of names can be fixed by anything so simple as a linguistic\nconvention. Rather, in both cases, it looks like it is going to be\nrather tempting to appeal to facts about the speaker in order to fix\nlinguistic reference. But if that is acceptable there, the case for\nruling out definite descriptions as non-referring starts to look much\nweaker. \n\nIf, unlike Kripke, we start with the idea that linguistic\nreference is, at root, the result of an act, of something that\nwe do rather than something that words themselves do, then\ndefinite descriptions start to look more like the normal case and\nindexicals like the outlier. This is, in fact, an old idea, one that\ndates back to Susan Stebbing (1943) and the later work of Ludwig\nWittgenstein (1958), and which we already saw running through the\nideas of Grice, Strawson, and\n Donnellan.[14]\n The enduring worry, of course, is that without some restrictions on\nhow we can use terms to successfully refer, we will divorce the theory\nof reference from both our intuitions on cases and from any role in an\noverall theory of communication. But if we embrace certain limits on\nreferential success\u2014to be imposed by either Gricean\nreflexivity, conventionalized constraints, or both\u2014these\nworries can plausibly be avoided. And, indeed, with respect to\ndefinite descriptions the case for there being a conventionalized\nconstraint on referential success, as Strawson took there to be, can\nlook particularly appealing.\n\nMore recently, a different sort of challenge has emerged for those\nclaiming that token definite descriptions sometimes refer: namely, the\ndifference in meaning which is standardly assumed to mark definite\ndescriptions off from their indefinite cousins (that is, descriptions\nlike \u2018a philosopher\u2019 as opposed to \u2018the\nphilosopher\u2019) has itself been called into question. Two main\nreasons have been offered for rejecting a difference in meaning\nbetween these sorts of phrases. First, pinning down exactly what this\ndistinction is supposed to amount to has proven remarkably difficult;\nevery aspect of Russell\u2019s original analysis, for instance, has\nsubsequently been cast into doubt. Second, a great many\nlanguages turn out to lack anything like the definite/indefinite distinction. This\nraises the possibility that this distinction is a far less\nsignificant, and less well-defined, feature of meaning, even in a\nlanguage like English, than it is usually taken to be (see Ludlow and\nSegal (2004); see also Abbott (2008) for counterarguments and the\nentry on\n descriptions\n for extensive discussion along with further references).\n\nHow would rejecting the definite/indefinite distinction affect debates\non whether token definite descriptions sometimes refer? Well, if it\nwere clear that indefinite descriptions could not be used to refer,\nand if these were indeed semantically equivalent to definite\ndescriptions, then we would have additional reason to think that\ndefinite descriptions cannot be used to refer either. On the other\nhand, some have argued that indefinite descriptions can refer,\nthough these arguments are highly controversial (see Chastain (1975)\nand Fodor and Sag (1982); again, see the entry on\n descriptions\n for further discussion and references). Even if we were to reject\nsuch a view, advocates of the unitary theory still typically grant\nthat there is a pragmatic difference marked by the use of\n\u2018the\u2019 as opposed to \u2018a\u2019. So it would be open\nto the stalwart defender of the view that token definite descriptions\nsometimes refer to try to argue that such pragmatic markers can play a\nsignificant role in regulating the use of descriptions to \nrefer\u2014despite these markers being nowhere reflected in meaning at\nthe level of what is said or asserted. Obviously, none of this will be\nsettled here.\n",
