    "main_text": "Preference logic\n2. Preference logic\n\nAlthough not all philosophical references to preference make use of\nformal tools, preferences are almost always assumed to have structural\nproperties of a type that is best described in a formalized language.\nThe study of the structural properties of preferences can be traced\nback to Book III of Aristotle\u2019s Topics. Since the early\ntwentieth century several philosophers have studied the structure of\npreferences with logical tools. In 1957 and in 1963, respectively,\nS\u00f6ren Halld\u00e9n and Georg Henrik von Wright proposed the\nfirst complete systems of preference logic (Halld\u00e9n 1957, von\nWright 1963). The subject also has important roots in utility theory\nand in the theory of games and decisions. The preferences studied in\npreference logic are usually the preferences of rational individuals,\nbut preference logic is also used in psychology and behavioural\neconomics, where the emphasis is on actual preferences as revealed in\nbehaviour.\n",
