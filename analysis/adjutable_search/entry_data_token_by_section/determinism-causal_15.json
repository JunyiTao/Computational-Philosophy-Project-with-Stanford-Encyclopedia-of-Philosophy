    "main_text": "The Status of Determinism in Physical Theories || General Relativity (GTR)\n4.3 General Relativity (GTR)\n\nDefining an appropriate form of determinism for the context of general\nrelativistic physics is extremely difficult, due to both foundational\ninterpretive issues and the plethora of weirdly-shaped space-time\nmodels allowed by the theory\u2019s field equations. The simplest way\nof treating the issue of determinism in GTR would be to state flatly:\ndeterminism fails, frequently, and in some of the most interesting\nmodels. Here we will briefly describe some of the most important\nchallenges that arise for determinism, directing the reader yet again\nto Earman (1986, 2007), and also Earman (1995) for more depth.\n4.3.1 Determinism and manifold points\n\nIn GTR, we specify a model of the universe by giving a triple of three\nmathematical objects, <M,\ng,T>. M represents\na continuous \u201cmanifold\u201d: that means a sort of unstructured\nspace (-time), made up of individual points and having smoothness or\ncontinuity, dimensionality (usually, 4-dimensional), and global\ntopology, but no further structure. What is the further structure a\nspace-time needs? Typically, at least, we expect the time-direction to\nbe distinguished from space-directions; and we expect there to be\nwell-defined distances between distinct points; and also a determinate\ngeometry (making certain continuous paths in M be\nstraight lines, etc.). All of this extra structure is coded into\ng, the metric field. So M and\ng together represent space-time. T\nrepresents the matter and energy content distributed around in\nspace-time (if any, of course).\n\nFor mathematical reasons not relevant here, it turns out to be\npossible to take a given model spacetime and perform a mathematical\noperation called a \u201chole diffeomorphism\u201d h* on\nit; the diffeomorphism\u2019s effect is to shift around the matter\ncontent T and the metric g relative\nto the continuous manifold\n M.[6]\n If the diffeomorphism is chosen appropriately, it can move around\nT and g after a certain time t =\n0, but leave everything alone before that time. Thus, the new\nmodel represents the matter content (now h*\nT) and the metric (h*g) as\ndifferently located relative to the points of M making up\nspace-time. Yet, the new model is also a perfectly valid model of the\ntheory. This looks on the face of it like a form of indeterminism:\nGTR\u2019s equations do not specify how things will be distributed in\nspace-time in the future, even when the past before a given time\nt is held fixed. See\n Figure 5:\n\n\n\nFigure 5: \u201cHole\u201d\ndiffeomorphism shifts contents of spacetime\n\n\nUsually the shift is confined to a finite region called the\nhole (for historical reasons). Then it is easy to see that the\nstate of the world at time t = 0 (and all the history that\ncame before) does not suffice to fix whether the future will be that\nof our first model, or its shifted counterpart in which events inside\nthe hole are different.\n\nThis is a form of indeterminism first highlighted by Earman and Norton\n(1987) as an interpretive philosophical difficulty for realism about\nGTR\u2019s description of the world, especially the point manifold\nM. They showed that realism about the manifold as a part of\nthe furniture of the universe (which they called \u201cmanifold\nsubstantivalism\u201d) commits us to an automatic indeterminism in\nGTR (as described above), and they argued that this is unacceptable.\nNote that this indeterminism, unlike most others we are discussing in\nthis section, is empirically undetectable: our two models\n<M, g, T> and the\nshifted model <M, h*g,\nh*T> are empirically\nindistinguishable.\n\nA huge range of responses to the Hole Argument have been published\nsince 1989; after an initial burst of articles in the late 1980s and\nearly-mid 1990s, there was a relatively quiet period, followed by a\nrevival of interest from 2011 onward (see\n the hole argument\n for in-depth consideration of a number of responses to the argument).\nOne popular family of responses (e.g., Hoefer 1996, Pooley 2006)\ndeparts from the observation that the differences represented by the\nmodels <M, g, T> and\n<M, h*g,\nh*T> are purely haecceitistic\nand therefore may be rejected if one adopts an anti-haecceitistic\nmetaphysics. Following Belot & Earman (2001), anti-haecceitist\nsubstantivalism is sometimes called \u201csophisticated\nsubstantivalism\u201d.\n4.3.2 Singularities\n\nThe separation of space-time structures into manifold and metric (or\nconnection) facilitates mathematical clarity in many ways, but also\nopens up Pandora\u2019s box when it comes to determinism. The\nindeterminism of the Earman and Norton hole argument is only the tip\nof the iceberg; singularities make up much of the rest of the berg. In\ngeneral terms, a singularity can be thought of as a \u201cplace where\nthings go bad\u201d in one way or another in the space-time model.\nFor example, near the center of a Schwarzschild black hole, curvature\nincreases without bound, and at the center itself it is undefined,\nwhich means that Einstein\u2019s equations cannot be said to hold,\nwhich means (arguably) that this point does not exist as a part of the\nspace-time at all! Some specific examples are clear, but giving a\ngeneral definition of a singularity, like defining determinism itself\nin GTR, is a vexed issue (see the entry on \n singularities and black holes\n and Earman (1995) for extensive treatments; Callender and Hoefer\n(2001) gives a brief overview). We will not attempt here to catalog\nthe various definitions and types of singularity.\n\nDifferent types of singularity bring different types of threat to\ndeterminism. In the case of ordinary black holes, mentioned above, all\nis well outside the so- called \u201cevent horizon\u201d, which is\nthe spherical surface defining the black hole: once a body or light\nsignal passes through the event horizon to the interior region of the\nblack hole, it can never escape again. Generally, no violation of\ndeterminism looms outside the event horizon; but what about inside?\nSome black hole models have so-called \u201cCauchy horizons\u201d\ninside the event horizon, i.e., surfaces beyond which determinism\nbreaks down.\n\nAnother way for a model spacetime to be singular is to have points or\nregions go missing, in some cases by simple excision. Perhaps the most\ndramatic form of this involves taking a nice model with a space-like\nsurface t = E (i.e., a well-defined part of the\nspace-time that can be considered \u201cthe state state of the world\nat time E\u201d), and cutting out and throwing away this\nsurface and all points temporally later. The resulting spacetime\nsatisfies Einstein\u2019s equations; but, unfortunately for any\ninhabitants, the universe comes to a sudden and unpredictable end at\ntime E. This is too trivial a move to be considered a real\nthreat to determinism in GTR; we can impose a reasonable requirement\nthat space-time not \u201crun out\u201d in this way without some\nphysical reason (the spacetime should be \u201cmaximally\nextended\u201d). For discussion of precise versions of such a\nrequirement, and whether they succeed in eliminating unwanted\nsingularities, see Earman (1995, chapter 2).\n\nThe most problematic kinds of singularities, in terms of determinism,\nare naked singularities (singularities not hidden behind an\nevent horizon). When a singularity forms from gravitational collapse,\nthe usual model of such a process involves the formation of an event\nhorizon (i.e. a black hole). A universe with an ordinary black hole\nhas a singularity, but as noted above, (outside the event horizon at\nleast) nothing unpredictable happens as a result. A naked singularity,\nby contrast, has no such protective barrier. In much the way that\nanything can disappear by falling into an excised-region singularity,\nor appear out of a white hole (white holes themselves are, in fact,\ntechnically naked singularities), there is the worry that anything at\nall could pop out of a naked singularity, without warning (hence,\nviolating determinism en passant). While most white hole\nmodels have Cauchy surfaces and are thus arguably\ndeterministic, other naked singularity models lack this property.\nPhysicists disturbed by the unpredictable potentialities of such\nsingularities have worked to try to prove various cosmic\ncensorship hypotheses that show\u2014under (hopefully) plausible\nphysical assumptions\u2014that such things do not arise by stellar\ncollapse in GTR (and hence are not liable to come into existence in\nour world). To date no very general and convincing forms of the\nhypothesis have been proven (see the entry on \n singularities and black holes,\n section 4) so the prospects for determinism in GTR as a mathematical\ntheory do not look terribly good.\n",
