    "main_text": "Variations on the Standard Dialogical Framework || .4 Material dialogues\n3.3 The Built-In Opponent\n\nAs mentioned in\n Section 1,\n the present entry focuses on the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition of\ndialogical logic (tradition 1). It may however be of use to outline\nthe general ideas of the Built-In Opponent (BIO) conception of\ndeduction, even though Catarina Dutilh Novaes stresses in her work\nthat this approach is distinct from the Lorenzen and Lorenz dialogical\ntradition (e.g., Dutilh Novaes 2015: 600; 2020: 37; Dutilh Novaes & French\n2018: 135).\n\nThe BIO conception of deduction is a rational reconstruction of\ndeductive reasoning inspired by certain historical considerations (see\nfor example Dutilh Novaes, 2016). In this regard, it claims neither\nhistorical nor factual accuracy, but it is a rational\nreconstruction of deductive reasoning, historically\ninspired. The purpose of this framework is to provide a\ndialogical interface\u2014in the sense of a junction\npoint\u2014between actual reasoning (deduction understood as a social\npractice, not as a logical norm) and formal logic. The BIO interface\ndeals mostly with people\u2019s actual reasoning patterns (Dutilh\nNovaes 2013) and informal logic (Dutilh Novaes & French 2018:\n131), bringing the general features of logic and argumentation to the\nfore. Thus,\n\n\nthe main claim is that, rather than comprising the canons for correct\nthinking, the traditional principles of deduction reflect\nrules for engaging in certain kinds of dialogical practices.\n(Dutilh Novaes 2015: 599)\n\n\nThis interface thus allows to approach empirical studies concerning\nthe way people actually reason with a dialogical model in mind, and\nthus explain the greater or lesser magnitude (across cultures and\nwithin a culture) with which people\u2019s reasoning patterns diverge\nfrom the norms of classical logic, by the greater or lesser\nfamiliarity these people have with certain types of dialogues they\nengage in. Thus, for instance, familiarity with testing situations\ncommon in school would greatly help people understand what is expected\nof them during the questioning process the empirical studies use for\nobtaining their data (Dutilh Novaes 2013).\n\nBut this BIO interface also allows to approach logical\nconsiderations from a dialogical perspective, either by considering\ndeduction as a very specialized social practice, or by putting\nGentzen\u2019s Natural Deduction or Sequent Calculus into a\ndialogical setting (French 2015; Dutilh Novaes & French 2018;\nFrench 2021). Deduction in itself is considered as an essentially\ndialogical matter (Dutilh Novaes 2013; 2015; 2016; 2020), where the role of\nthe interlocutor (the Opponent or Skeptic) has been\n\u201cinternalized\u201d over time, in the sense that the deductive\nmethod has integrated its role, which is not apparent anymore (Dutilh\nNovaes 2015: 600). In this regard, when a mathematician or a logician\nspells out a proof, they adopt both roles, the proponent\u2019s and\nthe opponent\u2019s. This is the idea behind the \u201cBuilt-In\nOpponent\u201d expression which was inspired by G\u00f6ran\nSundholm\u2019s lectures and talks on assertion, by the year 2000,\nwhen suggesting the idea that elimination rules can be read as the\nmoves of an opponent aimed at testing the thesis. Another work dealing\nwith the connexion between Natural Deduction and the dialogical\napproach in the sense of tradition 1 is Rahman et al. (2009) which was\nalso directly influenced by Sundholm\u2019s suggestion, and where the\nbranches in the inference rules are said to incarnate the\nchoices of the players as they appear in the extensive form of a\nstrategy. The BIO conception shares this inspiration but developed in\nits own, proper dialogical conception and its proper objectives.\n\nThe BIO interface mostly takes the form of Prover-Skeptic games\ninspired from S\u00f8rensen and Urzyczyn (2006), which developed a\ndialogical framework motivated by questions in the study of\ncomputation. In the BIO, the Prover (or proponent) is the player who\nproves that the conclusion of the deduction follows from the premises,\nand the Skeptic (or opponent) is the player who doubts each step of\nthe proof and who will raise objections if he can. The game starts\nwith Prover asking Skeptic to grant the premises, which Skeptic\naccepts for the sake of the argument. Then Prover states what\nnecessarily follows from these premises, and Skeptic\u2019s role is\nto make sure that each new statement made by Prover clearly follows\nfrom the previous statements. Prover can thus provide counter-examples\nto a statement or ask clarifications (\u201cwhy does this\nfollow?\u201d). Skeptic\u2019s role is thus to check that the proof\nis compelling. The play is asymmetric, since Prover defends and\nSkeptic attacks.\n\nFrom this informal structure, the BIO interface can import traditional\nNatural Deduction, with the introduction and elimination rules, or\neven a \u201c\u2018structurally explicit\u2019 sequent to sequent\nstyle\u201d version (French 2021: section 3.1) in the fashion of\nDummett (1977). Prover then brings forth sequents for Skeptic to\naccept, and Prover is entitled to state sequents that follow in virtue\nof the introduction and elimination rules or in virtue of\n\u201cstructural\u201d rules.\n\nAs mentioned above, \u201cstructural rules\u201d may refer to two\nthings: either to the standard dialogical structural rules presented\nin Section 2, or, as it is here the case, to rules imported from\nanother framework (which would be called \u201cstrategic\u201d rules\nin the standard framework). In the BIO approach, Prover can thus\nproduce sequents that follow from others in virtue of rules such as\ncontraction or weakening. The aim of this kind of dialogical approach\nis to understand the \u201cstructural\u201d properties of\ndeduction.\n\nWhen concerned with formal logic, the BIO interface thus has purely\nstrategic considerations, and is not much concerned by the play level.\nIn this respect, the disappearance of the opponent in deductive proofs\nis justified through the strategic focus: Prover does not actually\nneed Skeptic if Prover is careful enough in carrying out the deductive\nmethod (making gap-free proofs).\n",
