    "main_text": "The Divine Creative Act || God, Matter and the Omnipresence of Desire\n4.3 God, Matter and the Omnipresence of Desire\n\n\nReturning to our earlier discussion, Ibn Gabirol describes pure\nmatter as stemming directly from the Divine Essence itself, with form,\non the contrary, arising somewhat secondarily\nfrom the Divine Will. While this is not to suggest that God is Himself\nmade up of matter (as concluded by some fans of Ibn Gabirol such as\nDavid of Dinant in the history of Christian philosophy who ran into\ntrouble with the Church for theorizing God as matter), there is\narguably in Ibn Gabirol an intimate link between God and matter. Such a\nlink between materiality and God is not much of a conceptual stretch\n(though in standard Platonic, Neoplatonic, and Aristotelian contexts we\nwould tend to link God with form): both matter and God are utterly\nhidden and utterly grounding for all else, while form (and the\nWill/Wisdom with which it is associated) mark the lesser\n\u201cactive\u201d or \u201cmanifesting\u201d mode of divinity and\nof the cosmos. While of course for Ibn Gabirol God is an utter unity,\nwe may nonetheless theorize with Ibn Gabirol as follows: As God's\nessential hiddenness moves forward into action (Wisdom/Will/Word), so\ntoo pure material pre-existence moves forward into manifest being (i.e.\nbecomes more and more en-formed). Here, in an important sense, the\nimages of \u201cdarkness and the hidden\u201d trump the images of\n\u201clight and the manifest\u201d both as they relate to God and to\nthe cosmos: as God's hidden Essence precedes and grounds his\nacts, so too matter precedes and grounds enformed being (and as such,\nall existents). Here, God and matter\u2014in their dark / hidden\nrespects\u2014have something very important in common. (See Pessin\n2009, p. 290, for chart mapping the superiority in this regard of the\nmaterial over the formal).\n\n\nIt ought be noted that herein lies a paradox found in one form or\nanother in all versions of Neoplatonism: on the one hand, there is a\nsense that moving forward (or downward) in the great chain of being is\na tragic fall away from the purity of divine unity; on the other hand,\nthere is a sense (not, for example, found in Gnostic materials) that\nthere is beauty and light in the creation, which is to say that in the\ncontinual downward manifesting of being we find the trace of Divine\nWill. In the context of Ibn Gabirol's conceptual space in which\n(as we will see in more detail in section 5) reality is seen as the\nprocess of moving from a more hidden / material to a more manifest /\nformal reality, the result is at once (1) a sense of loss in the move\naway from God's own hiddenness (with a sense that darkness is\nsublime) and (2) a sense of beauty and increasing grace as more and\nmore forms continue to manifest (\u201cjoining\u201d to matter\nthrough the intermediation of the Divine Will), resulting ultimately in\nthe fullness of the cosmos (with a sense that light is sublime). These\ndueling images of the sublimity of unity (or pre-creation) on the one\nhand and manifestness (or creation) on the other (here in terms of the\nsublimity of darkness on the one hand and light on the other) offer an\ninsight into what we may call a Neoplatonic \u201ctheology of\nparadox\u201d which is very much at play in Ibn Gabirol.\n\n\nIn his conception of God's relation to matter in the act of\ncreation, we must also emphasize Ibn Gabirol's focus on desire.\nProviding a bit more context to (and a different translation of) Ibn\nGabirol's Keter Malkh\u00fbt [Kingdom's\nCrown] rehearsing of God's \u201csplitting of the\nnothing\u201d (see section 4.1), consider:\n\n\nYou are wise, and your wisdom gave rise to an endless desire in the\nworld as within an artist or worker\u2014to bring out the stream of\nexistence from Nothing\u2026He called to Nothing\u2014which split;\nto existence\u2014pitched like a tent\u2026With desire's span\nhe established the heavens\u2026 (Canto 9 of the Keter\nMalkh\u00fbt; translation from Cole 2001, p. 149)\n\n\nIn these poetic lines, as elsewhere throughout his writing, Ibn\nGabirol emphasizes the central motion of desire at the core of the\nuniverse. This can be seen throughout the Fons Vitae\nin the dual reminders that (1) all things have matter at their core,\nand (2) matter's own reality consists essentially in desire (viz.\na desiring-after-form). These two simple ideas lead to a much more\narresting insight, viz. inasmuch as all things are grounded in matter,\nand inasmuch as matter is a marker of desire, it follows that all\nreality is grounded in desire. Desire\u2014in the guise of matter\u2014is \nin this sense a central principle of Ibn\nGabirol's\n universe.[26]\n",
