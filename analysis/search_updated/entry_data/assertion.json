    "preamble": "\n\nAsserting is the act of claiming that something is the case\u2014for\ninstance, that oranges are citruses, or that there is a\ntraffic congestion on Brooklyn Bridge (at some time). We make\nassertions to share information, coordinate our actions, defend\narguments, and communicate our beliefs and desires. Because of its\ncentral role in communication, assertion has been investigated in\nseveral disciplines. Linguists, philosophers of language, and\nlogicians rely heavily on the notion of assertion in theorizing about\nmeaning, truth and inference.\n\nThe nature of assertion and its relation to other speech acts and\nlinguistic phenomena (implicatures, presuppositions, etc.) have been\nsubject to much controversy. This entry will situate assertion within\nspeech act theory and pragmatics more generally, and then go on to\npresent the current main accounts of\n assertion.[1]\n\nBy an account of assertion is here meant a theory of what\na speaker does (e.g., expresses a belief) in making an\nassertion. According to such accounts, there are deep properties of\nassertion: specifying those properties is specifying what asserting\nconsists in. There must also be surface properties, which are\nthe properties by which a competent speaker can tell whether an\nutterance is an assertion, for instance that it is made by means of\nuttering a sentence in the indicative mood.\n\nWe shall classify accounts according two parameters. Firstly, we\ndistinguish between normative and descriptive\naccounts. Normative accounts rely on the existence of norms or\nnormative relations that are essential to assertoric practice.\nDescriptive accounts don\u2019t. Secondly, we distinguish between\ncontent-directed and hearer-directed accounts.\nContent-directed accounts focus on the relation between the speaker\nand the content of the proposition asserted, while hearer-directed\naccounts focus on the relations between speaker and hearer. Some\ntheories have both normative and descriptive components. The entry is\nstructured as follows\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Speech Acts\n\nConsider typical utterances made by means of the following\nsentences\n\n(1)\n\n\na.\nThere is beer in the fridge.\nb.\nIs there a beer in the fridge?\nc.\nI wish there were a beer in the fridge.\nd.\nPut a beer in the fridge!\n \n\n\nSentence (1a) would typically be used to make an assertion. The\nspeaker would tell or inform a hearer that there is\na beer in the fridge. Such an utterance of is called\nassertoric, or assertive. By contrast, (1b) would be\nused to ask a question (and the utterance would then be\ninterrogative), (1c) to express a wish (optative),\nand (1d) to make a command, or a request (imperative). This\nentry is about utterances of the first kind, and about the speech acts\nperformed by means of them.\n\nGottlob Frege emphasized the distinction between judging a thought\ncontent (what Frege called a Thought) to be true, and merely\nthinking/entertaining that content. Both are distinct from the content\nitself. Analogously, he distinguished between utterances with\nassertoric quality, or force (see below), and utterances\nwithout assertoric force. For instance, an assertoric\nutterance of\n\n(2)\nIf it is raining, there will be umbrella salesmen in the\nstreet.\n\n\nas a whole, by which the conditional proposition is asserted, contains\nas a proper part an utterance or the antecedent \u2018it is\nraining\u2019. But the utterance of \u201cit is raining\u201d is\nnot itself assertoric. The conditional can be true whether the\nantecedent is true or false, and hence the speaker\u2019s belief\nabout rain is left open by the assertion\n\nLike Frege, C.S. Peirce stressed the importance of distinguishing\n\u201cbetween a proposition and what one does with it\u201d. He also\nadopted, albeit implicitly, a distinction between force and\ncontent:\n\n\none and the same proposition may be affirmed, denied, judged, doubted,\ninwardly inquired into, put as a question, wished, asked for,\neffectively commanded, taught, or merely expressed, and does not\nthereby become a different proposition (Peirce [NEM]:\n 248).[2]\n\n\nFrege characterized the assertoric quality of an utterance as an\nassertoric force (\u201cbehauptende Kraft\u201d;\nFrege 1918a [TFR: 330]) of the utterance. This idea was later taken\nover by J. L. Austin (1962 [1975: 99\u2013100]), the founding father\nof the general theory of speech acts. Austin distinguished between\nseveral levels of speech act, including these: the locutionary act,\nthe illocutionary act and the perlocutionary act. The locutionary act\nis the act of \u201c\u2006\u2018saying something\u2019 in the full\nnormal sense\u201d (1962 [1975: 94]), which is the utterance of\ncertain words with certain meanings in a certain grammatical\nconstruction, such as uttering \u2018I like ice\u2019 as a sentence\nof English.\n\nThe notion of an illocutionary act was introduced by Austin by means\nof examples (1962 [1975: 98\u2013102]), and that is the normal\nprocedure. Illocutionary acts are such acts as asserting, asking a\nquestion, warning, threatening, announcing a verdict or intention,\nmaking an appointment, giving an order, expressing a wish, making a\nrequest. An utterance of a sentence, i.e., a locutionary act, by means\nof which a question is asked is thus an utterance with\ninterrogative force, an if an assertion is made, it has\nassertoric force.\n\nThe perlocutionary act is made by means of an illocutionary act, and\ndepends entirely on the hearer\u2019s reaction. For instance, by\nmeans of arguing the speaker may convince the hearer, and by\nmeans of warning the speaker may frighten the hearer. In\nthese examples, convincing and frightening are perlocutionary\nacts.\n\nThe illocutionary act does not depend on the hearer\u2019s reaction\nto the utterance. Still, according to Austin (1962 [1975:\n116\u20137]) it does depend on the hearer\u2019s being aware of the\nutterance and understanding it in a certain way: I haven\u2019t\nwarned someone unless he heard what I said. In this sense, the\nperformance of an illocutionary act depends on the \u201csecuring of\nuptake\u201d (Austin 1962 [1975: 117]). However, although\nAustin\u2019s view is intuitively plausible for speech acts verbs\nwith speaker-hearer argument structure (like x congratulates\ny) or speaker-hearer-content argument structure (x\ntells y that p), it is less plausible when the\nstructure is speaker-content (\u201cBill asserted that\np\u201d). It may be said that Bill failed to tell\nLisa that the station was closed, since she had already left\nthe room when he said so, but that Bill still asserted that\nit was closed, since Bill believed she was still\n there.[3]\n\nAustin had earlier (1956) initiated the development of speech act\ntaxonomy by means of the distinction between constative and\nperformative utterances. Roughly, whereas in a constative\nutterance you report an already obtaining state of affairs\u2014you\nsay something\u2014in a performative utterance you create\nsomething new: you do something (Austin 1956 [1979: 235]).\nAssertion is the paradigm of a constative utterance. Paradigm examples\nof performatives are utterances by means of which actions such as\nbaptizing, congratulating and greeting are performed. However, when\ndeveloping his general theory of speech acts, Austin abandoned the\nconstative/performative distinction, the reason being that it is not\nso clear in what sense something is done for instance by\nmeans of an optative utterance, whereas nothing is done by means of an\nassertoric one.\n\nAustin noted, e.g., that assertions are subject both to infelicities\nand to various kinds of appraisal, just like performatives (Austin\n1962 [1975: 13\u201366]). For instance, an assertion is\ninsincere in case of lying as a promise is insincere when the\nappropriate intention is lacking (Austin 1962 [1975: 40]). This is an\ninfelicity of the abuse kind. Also, an assertion is,\naccording to Austin, void in case of a failed referential\npresupposition, such as in Russell\u2019s\n\n(3)\nThe present King of France is bald\n\n\n(Austin 1962 [1975: 20]). This is then an infelicity of the same\nkind\u2014flaw-type misexecutions\u2014as the use of the\nwrong formula in a legal procedure (Austin 1962 [1975: 36]), or of the\nsame kind\u2014misinvocations\u2014as when the requirements\nof a naming procedure aren\u2019t met (Austin 1962 [1975: 51]).\n\nFurther, Austin noted that when it comes to appraisals, there is not a\nsharp difference between acts that are simply true and false, and acts\nthat are assessed in other respects (Austin 1962 [1975: 140\u20137]).\nOn the one hand, a warning can be objectively proper or improper,\ndepending on the facts. On the other hand, assertions (statements) can\nbe assessed as suitable in some contexts and not in others, and are\nnot simply true or\n false.[4]\n\nAs an alternative to the constative/performative distinction, Austin\nsuggested five classes of illocutionary types (or illocutionary\nverbs): verdictives, exercitives,\ncommissives, behabitives and expositives\n(Austin 1962 [1975: 151\u201364]). You exemplify a verdictive, e.g.,\nwhen as a judge you pronounce a verdict; an exercitive by appointing,\nvoting or advising; a commissive by promising, undertaking or\ndeclaring that you will do something; a behabitive by apologizing,\ncriticizing, cursing or congratulating; an expositive by acts\nappropriately prefixed by phrases like \u2018I reply\u2019, \u2018I\nargue\u2019, \u2018I concede\u2019 etc., of a general expository\nnature.\n\nIn this classification, assertion would best be placed under\nexpositives, since the prefix \u201cI assert\u201d is or may be of\nan expository nature. Austin explicitly includes the verbs\n\u201caffirm\u201d, \u201cdeny\u201d, and \u201cstate\u201d, in\nhis first group of expositives (1962 [1975: 162]). Marina Sbis\u00e0\n(2020) argues that assertion belongs to both expositives and to\nverdictives, insofar as assertion expresses a judgment/verdict.\n\nOther taxonomies have been proposed, for instance by Stephen Schiffer\n(1972), John Searle (1975b), Kent Bach and Robert M. Harnish (1979),\nFrancois Recanati (1987), and William P. Alston\n (2000).[5]\n2. Pragmatics\n\nAssertion is generally thought of being open, explicit and direct, as\nopposed for instance to implying something without explicitly saying\nit. In this respect, assertion is contrasted with\npresupposition and implicature. The contrast is,\nhowever, not altogether sharp, partly because of the idea of indirect\nspeech acts, including indirect assertions.\n2.1 Presupposition\n\nA sentence such as\n\n(4)\nKepler died in misery.\n\n\nis not true unless the singular term \u2018Kepler\u2019 has\nreference. Still, Frege argued that a speaker asserting that Kepler\ndied in misery, by means of (4) does not also assert that\n\u2018Kepler\u2019 has reference (Frege 1892 [TPW: 69]). That Kepler\nhas reference is not part of the sense of the sentence. Frege\u2019s\nreason was that if it had been, the sense of its negation\n\n(5)\nKepler did not die in misery.\n\n\nwould have been that Kepler did not die in misery or\n\u2018Kepler\u2019 does not have reference, which is absurd.\nAccording to Frege, that \u2018Kepler\u2019 has reference is rather\npresupposed, both in an assertion of\n (4)\n and in an assertion of its negation.\n\nThe modern treatment of presupposition has followed Frege in treating\nsurvival under negation as the most important test for presupposition.\nThat is, if it is implied that p, both in an assertion of a\nsentence s and in an assertion of the negation of s,\nthen it is presupposed that p in those assertions (unless\nthat p is entailed by all sentences). Other typical examples\nof presupposition (Levinson 1983: 178\u2013181) include\n\n(6)\nJohn managed [didn\u2019t manage] to stop in time.\n\n\nimplying that John tried to stop in time, and\n\n(7)\nMartha regrets [doesn\u2019t regret] drinking John\u2019s home\nbrew.\n\n\nimplying that Martha drank John\u2019s home brew.\n\nIn the case of\n (4),\n the presupposition is clearly of a semantic nature, since the\nsentence \u201cSomeone is identical with Kepler\u201d, which is true\njust if \u2018Kepler\u2019 has reference, is a logical consequence\nof\n (4)\n and (under a standard interpretation) of (5). By contrast, in the\nnegated forms of\n (6)\n and\n (7),\n the presupposition can be canceled by context, e.g., as in\n\n(8)\nJohn didn\u2019t manage to stop in time. He didn\u2019t even\ntry.\n\n\nThis indicates that in this case the presupposition is rather a\npragmatic phenomenon; it is the speaker or speech act rather than the\nsentence or the proposition expressed that presupposes something.\n\nHowever, the issue of separating semantic from pragmatic aspects of\npresupposition is complex, and regarded differently in different\napproaches to presupposition (for an overview, see Simons\n 2006).[6]\n2.2 Implicature\n\nFrege noted (1879: [TPW:10]) that there is no difference in truth\nconditional content between sentences such as\n\n(9)\n\n\na.\nJohn works with real estate and likes fishing.\nb.\nJohn works with real estate but likes fishing.\n \n\n\n\u201cand\u201d and \u201cbut\u201d contribute the same way to\ntruth and falsity. However, when using\n (9b),\n but not when using\n (9a),\n the speaker indicates that there is a contrast of some kind between\nworking with real estate and liking fishing. The speaker is not\nasserting that there is a contrast. We can test this, for\ninstance, by forming a conditional with\n (9b).\n The antecedent of (10) preserves the contrast rather than make it\nhypothetical, showing that the contrast is not asserted, forming a\nconditional with\n (9b)\n in the antecedent preserves the contrast rather than make it\nhypothetical:\n\n(10)\nIf John works with real estate but likes fishing, I think we can\nbring him along.\n\n\nIt is usually said that the speaker in cases like\n (9b)\n and\n (10)\nimplicates that there is a contrast. These are examples of\nimplicature. H. Paul Grice (1975, 1989) developed a general\ntheory of implicature. Grice called implicatures of the kind\nexemplified conventional, since it is a standing feature of\nthe word \u201cbut\u201d to give rise to them.\n\nMost of Grice\u2019s theory is concerned with the complementing kind,\nthe conversational implicatures. These are subdivided into\nthe particularized ones, which depend on features of the\nconversational context, and the generalized ones, which\ndon\u2019t (Grice 1975: 37\u20138). The particularized\nconversational implicature rely on general conversational maxims, not\non features of expressions. These maxims are thought to be in force in\nordinary conversation. For instance, the maxim Be orderly!\nrequires of the speaker to recount events in the order they took\nplace. This is meant to account for the intuitive difference in\ncontent between\n\n(11)\n\n\na.\nJohn took off his shoes and sat down.\nb.\nJohn sat down and took off his shoes.\n \n\n\nAccording to Grice\u2019s account, the speaker doesn\u2019t assert,\nonly implicates that the events took place in the order recounted.\nWhat is asserted is just that both events did take place.\n\nReal or apparent violations of the maxims generate implicatures, on\nthe assumption that the participants obey the over-arching\nCooperative Principle. For instance, in the conversation\n\n(12)\n\n\nA:\nWhere does John spend the summer?\nB:\nSomewhere in Canada.\n \n\n\nB implicates that he doesn\u2019t know where in Canada John\nspends the summer. The reasoning is as follows: B violates\nthe Maxim of Quantity to be as informative as required. Since\nB is assumed to be cooperative, we can infer that he cannot\nsatisfy the Maxim of Quantity without violating some other maxim. The\nbest candidate is the sub-maxim of the Maxim of Quality, which\nrequires you not to say anything for which you lack sufficient\nevidence. Hence, one can infer that B doesn\u2019t know.\nAgain, B has not asserted that he doesn\u2019t know, but\nstill managed to convey it in an indirect\n manner.[7]\n2.3 Indirect assertions\n\nThe distinction between assertion and implicature is to some extent\nundermined by acknowledging indirect assertion as a kind of\nassertion proper. A standard example of an indirect speech act is\ngiven by\n\n(13)\nCan you pass the salt?\n\n\nBy means of uttering an interrogative sentence the speaker requests\nthe addressee to pass the salt. The request is indirect. The question,\nliterally concerning the addressee\u2019s ability to pass the salt,\nis direct. As defined by John Searle (1975b: 59\u201360), and also by\nBach and Harnish (1979: 70), an indirect illocutionary act is\nsubordinate to another, more primary act and depends on the success of\nthe first. An alternative definition, given by Sadock (1974: 73), is\nthat an act is indirect just if it has a different illocutionary force\nfrom the one standardly correlated with the sentence-type used.\n\nExamples of indirect assertions by means of questions and\ncommands/requests are given by\n\n(14)\n\n\na.\nMay I tell you that, obviously, the square root of a quarter is a\nhalf?\nb.\nLet me tell you that, obviously, the square root of a quarter is a\nhalf!\n \n\n\n(Levinson 1983: 266). Rhetorical questions also have the force of\nassertions:\n\n(15)\nIs not Switzerland a peace-loving nation?\n\n\nAnother candidate type is irony:\n\n(16)\nSwitzerland is known for its aggressive foreign policy.\n\n\nassuming the speaker does mean the negation of what is literally said.\nHowever, although in a sense the act is indirect, since the speaker\nasserts something different from what she would do on a normal, direct\nuse of the sentence, and relies on the hearer to realize this, it is\nnot an indirect assertion by either definition. It isn\u2019t on the\nfirst, since the primary act (the literal assertion) isn\u2019t even\nmade, and it isn\u2019t on the second, since there is no discrepancy\nbetween force and sentence\n type.[8]\n\nThe very idea of indirect speech acts is, however, controversial. It\nis not universally agreed that an ordinary utterance of\n (13)\n is indirect, since it has been denied, e.g., by Levinson (1983:\n273\u20136) that a question has really been asked, over and above the\nrequest. Similarly, Levinson have questioned the idea of a standard\ncorrelation between force and sentence form, by which a request would\ncount as indirect on Sadock\u2019s criterion.\n\nCommon to all conceptions of indirect assertions is that they are not\nexplicit: what is expressed, or literally said, is not the same as\nwhat is asserted. One question is whether an utterance is an assertion\nproper that p if that content is not exactly what is\nexpressed, or whether it is an act of a related kind, perhaps an\n implicature.[9]\n2.4 Explicitness\n\nA related question is how far an utterance may deviate from\nexplicitness and yet be counted as an assertion, proper or indirect.\nAccording to one intuition, as soon as it is not fully determinate to\nthe hearer what the intended content of an utterance is, or what force\nit is made with, the utterance fails to be assertoric.\nUnderdetermination is the crucial issue. This has been argued by\nElizabeth Fricker (2012). But the issue is controversial, and\nobjections of several kinds have been made, for instance by John\nHawthorne (2012), Andrew Peet (2015, forthcoming) and Manuel\nGarc\u00eda-Carpintero (2016,\n 2019b).[10]\n3. Descriptive Accounts, Content-Directed\n\nDescriptive accounts characterize assertion in terms of its\npsychological, social, and linguistic features, without appeal to\nnormative notions. The content-directed accounts focus on the\nrelations between the speaker and content and between hearer and\ncontent.\n3.1 Relation to truth\n\nFrege (1918a [TFR: 329]) held that an assertion is an outward sign of\na judgment (Urteil). A judgment in turn, in\nFrege\u2019s view, is a step from entertaining a Thought to\nacknowledging its truth (Frege 1892 [TPW:\n 64]).[11]\n The subject first merely thinks the Thought that p, and\nthen, at the judgment stage, moves on to acknowledge it as true. Since\nfor Frege, the truth value is the reference (Bedeutung) of a\nsentence, a judgment is an advance from the sense of a sentence to its\nreference. In case the subject makes a mistake, it is not the actual\nreference, but the reference the subject takes it to\nhave.\n\nFor Frege, truth is not relative. There is exactly one point of\nevaluation of a Thought, the world itself. If instead we accept more\nthan one point of evaluation, such as different possible worlds, truth\nsimpliciter is equated with truth at the actual world. We can\nthen adapt Frege\u2019s view to say that judging that p is\nadvancing to reference at the actual world, or again,\nevaluating as true in the actual world.\n\nOn this picture, what holds for judgment carries over to assertion. It\nis in the force of an utterance that the step is taken from the\ncontent to the actual point of evaluation. This view has been stated\nby Recanati with respect to the actual world:\n\n\n[\u2026] a content is not enough; we need to connect that content\nwith the actual world, via the assertive force of the utterance, in\nvirtue of which the content is presented as characterizing that world.\n(Recanati 2007: 37)\n\n\nIn Pagin (2016a: 276\u2013278), this idea is generalized. If contents\nare possible-worlds propositions, the points of evaluation are\npossible worlds. All actual judgments are then applications of\npropositions to the actual world. If contents are\ntemporal propositions, true or false with respect to\nworld-time pairs, then all actual judgments are applications to the\nordered pair of the actual world and a relevant time, usually the time\nat which the judgment is made. This is the point with respect to which\na sentence, used in a context of utterance, has its truth value (cf.\nKaplan 1989: 522). Again, the relation is general: if the content of a\njudgment is a function from indices of some type to truth\nvalues, then a judgment is the very step of taking the content to be\ntrue at the actual/current index, or again applying the\ncontent to that index. The force of an assertion, on this\nview, connects the content of the assertion with the relevant index.\nThe assertion indicates that the content is true at the\nindex.\n\nOn the more social side, it is often said that in asserting a\nproposition the speaker \u201cpresents the proposition as true\u201d\n(cf. Wright 1992: 34). Prima facie, this characterizes\nassertion well. However, there are problems with the idea. One is that\nit should generalize to other speech act types, but does not seem to\ndo so. For instance, does a question present a proposition as one the\nspeaker would like to know the truth value of? If so, it does\nnot seem that this way of presenting the proposition distinguishes\nbetween the interrogative force in\n (17a),\n the optative force in\n (17b),\n and the imperative force in\n (17c).\n\n(17)\n\n\na.\nIs Elsa at home?\nb.\nI would like to know whether Elsa is at home.\nc.\nInform me whether Elsa is at home!\n \n\n\nIf other speech act types could be characterized in ways analogous to\nassertion, that would strengthen the proposal. If not, it appears to\nbe a weakness.\n\nAnother problem is that it remains unclear what\n\u201cpresenting\u201d amounts to. It must be a sense of the word\ndifferent from that in which the proposition is presented as true in\nthe sentence\n\n(18)\nThe proposition that snow is white is true.\n\n\neven if the sentence is not uttered assertorically. That is,\n\u201cpresent as true\u201d must not refer to a feature simply of\ncontent. Since there is a sense of \u201cpresent as\nsuch-and-such\u201d that does refer to representational\ncontent, there is a need to specify, in a non-question-begging way,\nthe other sense of \u201cpresent\u201d that is relevant.\n\nIn addition, there is a question of distinguishing the assertoric way\nof presenting something as true from weaker illocutionary\nalternatives, such as guesses and conjectures, which also in some\nsense present their contents as being true.\n\nThere are therefore weaker senses of \u201cpresent as true\u201d,\nwhich do not require that the presentation itself is made with\nassertoric force (like an obsolete label on a bottle), and these\nsenses are too weak. There is clearly also a stronger sense that\ndoes require assertoric force (for cases when the label is\ntaken to apply), but that is just what we want to have\n(non-circularly) explained. Simply using the phrase \u201cpresent as\ntrue\u201d does not by itself help.\n\nAnother idea for characterizing assertion in terms of truth-related\nattitudes is that assertion aims at truth. This is stated for\ninstance both by Bernard Williams (1966), by Michael Dummett (1973\n[1981]), and more recently by Marsili (2018). The notion of\n\u201caiming at truth\u201d can be understood in rather different\nways (for some ways of understanding what it could be for\nbelief to aim at truth, see Engel 2004 and Gl\u00fcer &\nWikforss\n 2013).[12]\n\nWilliams (1966) characterizes assertion\u2019s aim in different\nterms. For him, the property of aiming at truth is what characterizes\nfact-stating discourse, as opposed to, e.g., evaluative or\ndirective discourse. It is natural to think of\n\n(19)\nThe moon is about 384.000 km from the Earth.\n\n\nas stating a fact, and of\n\n(20)\nBardot is good.\n\n\nas expressing an evaluation, not corresponding to any fact of the\nmatter. On Williams\u2019s view, to regard a sincere utterance of\n\n(21)\nIt is wrong to steal.\n\n\nas a moral assertion, is to take a realistic\nattitude to moral discourse: there are moral facts, making moral\nstatements objectively true or false. This view again comes in two\nversions. On the first alternative, the existence of moral facts\nrenders the discourse fact-stating, whether the speaker thinks so or\nnot, and the non-existence renders it evaluative, again whether the\nspeaker thinks so or not. On the second alternative, an utterance of\n (21)\n is an assertion if the speaker has a realistic attitude towards moral\ndiscourse and otherwise not.\n\nOn these views, it is assumed that truth is a substantial property\n(Williams 1966: 202), not a concept that can be characterized in some\ndeflationary way. As a consequence, the sentence\n\n(22)\n\u201cBardot is good\u201d is true.\n\n\nis to be regarded as false, since\n (22)\n is objectively neither true nor false; there is no fact of the\n matter.[13]\n3.2 Cognitive models of communication\n\nPerhaps the best way of capturing the cognitive nature of assertion is\nto give a theory of the cognitive features of normal communication by\nmeans of assertion. A classic theory is Stalnaker\u2019s (1974,\n1978). Stalnaker provides a model of a conversation in which assertion\nand presupposition dynamically interact. On Stalnaker\u2019s model,\npropositions are presupposed in a conversation if they are on record\nas belonging to the common ground between the speakers. When an\nassertion is made and accepted in the conversation, its content is\nadded to the common ground, and the truth of the proposition in\nquestion will be presupposed in later stages. What is presupposed at a\ngiven stage has an effect on the interpretation of new utterances made\nat that stage. For Stalnaker, the common ground is a set of\npropositions. He models this with the set of worlds in which all\ncommon ground propositions are true, the context set.\n\nIn this framework Stalnaker (1978: 88\u201389) proposes three rules\nfor assertion:\n\n(Stal)\n\n\ni.\nA proposition is always true in some but not in all of the\npossible worlds in the context set.\nii.\nAny assertive utterance should express a proposition, relative to\neach possible world in the context set, and that proposition should\nhave truth value in each possible world in the context set.\niii.\nThe same proposition is expressed relative to each possible world\nin the context set.\n \n\n\nStalnaker comments on the first rule:\n\n\nTo assert something incompatible with what is presupposed is\nself-defeating [\u2026] And to assert something which already\npresupposed is to attempt to do something that is already done.\n\n\nOn such an approach, the satisfaction of a presupposition is an\nadmittance condition of an assertion (cf. Karttunen 1974;\nHeim 1988). This idea connects with Austin\u2019s more general idea\nof felicity conditions of speech\n acts.[14]\n Does Stalnaker offer an account of assertion itself? The answer is\nno, for the role of assertion is shared by other speech acts such as\nassuming and conjecturing (Stalnaker 1978: 153).\nWhat is added to the common ground is only for the purpose of\nconversation, and need not be actually believed by the\nparticipants. It is only required that it be accepted (cf.\nStalnaker 2002: 716).\n\nStalnaker has not (as far as we are aware) attempted to add a\ndistinguishing feature of assertion to the model. This has, however,\nbeen attempted by Schaffer (2008), K\u00f6lbel (2011: 68\u201370),\nand Stokke\n (2013).[15]\n\nAnother cognitive account is offered by Pagin (2011, 2020). The\naccount is summarized by the phrase: \u201can assertion is an\nutterance that is prima facie informative\u201d. For an utterance to\nbe informative is for it to be made in part \u201cbecause it is\ntrue\u201d. What this amounts to is different, but complementary, for\nspeaker and hearer. For the speaker, part of the reason for\nusing a particular sentence is that it is true (in context); that is,\nthe speaker believes, with a sufficient strength, that the sentence\nexpresses a true proposition, and utters it partly because of that.\nFor the hearer, taking the utterance as informative, means, by\ndefault, to update their credence in the proposition as a response to\nthe utterance, both in the upwards direction and to a level above\n0.5.\n\nThe prima facie element of the account means that the typical\nproperties on the speaker and hearer side are only default\nproperties associated with surface features of the utterance: the\ndeclarative sentence type, a typical intonation pattern, etc. There\nare many possible reasons why a speaker may utter such a sentence\nwithout believing the proposition, and why a hearer may not adjust\ntheir credence in the typical manner. For example, the speaker may be\nlying, the hearer may distrust the speaker, or may already have given\nthe proposition a very high credence before the utterance. On\nPagin\u2019s picture, it is the cognitive patterns associated with\nsurface features, on the production and comprehension sides, that\ncharacterize assertion. This way of dividing the account between\nspeaker and hearer is somewhat controversial.\n\nYet another cognitive account is elaborated in Jary (2010).\nJary\u2019s account is situated within Relevance Theory, a\nmore general account of cognition and communication. As a typical\ningredient of this general framework, when an assertion is made, the\nproposition expressed by the utterance is presented as \u201crelevant\nto the hearer\u201d (2010: 163), where \u2018relevant\u2019 is a\ntechnical term (Sperber & Wilson 1986 [1995: 265]).\n\nWhat distinguishes assertion from other speech act types is something\ndifferent:\n\n\nAssertion cannot be defined thus, though. In order for an utterance to\nhave assertoric force, it must also be subject to the cognitive and\nsocial safeguards that distinguish assertion. [\u2026] It is the\napplicability of these safeguards that distinguishes assertion both\nfrom other illocutionary acts and from other forms of information\ntransfer. (Jary 2010: 163\u2013164)\n\n\nSocial safeguards consist in sanctions against misleading assertions,\nwhile cognitive safeguards consist in the ability of the hearer to not\nsimply accept what is said but meta-represent the speaker as\nexpressing certain beliefs and intentions (2010: 160). It is part of a\nfull account of assertion, according to Jary, that assertions are\nsubject to these safeguards. This also distinguishes assertions from\npromises and commands, where the proposition is not presented as\nsubject to the hearer\u2019s safeguards; \u201crejection is not\npresented as an option for the hearer\u201d (2010: 73).\n4. Descriptive Accounts, Hearer-Directed\n\nHearer-directed accounts of assertion are primarily concerned with the\nspeaker\u2019s thoughts and intentions about their audience.\n4.1 Self-representation\n\nAccording to Frege (1918a [TFR: 329]), as noted, an assertion is an\noutward sign of a judgment (Urteil). The term\n\u201cjudgment\u201d has been used in several ways. If it is used to\nmean either belief, or act by which a belief is formed or\nreinforced, then Frege\u2019s view is pretty close to the view\nthat assertion is the expression of belief.\n\nThis idea, that assertion is the expression of belief, has a longer\nhistory, going back to at least Kant. How should one understand the\nidea of expressing here? It is natural to think of a belief state,\nthat is, a mental state of the speaker, as causally co-responsible for\nthe making of the assertion. The speaker has a belief and wants to\ncommunicate it, which motivates an assertoric utterance. But what\nabout the cases when the speaker does not believe what he asserts? Can\nwe still say, even of insincere assertions, that they express belief?\nIf so, in what sense?\n\nWithin the communicative intentions tradition, Bach and Harnish have\nemphasized that an assertion gives the hearer evidence for\nthe corresponding belief, and that what is common to the sincere and\ninsincere case is the intention of providing such evidence:\n\n\nFor S to express an attitude is for S to\nR-intend the hearer to take S\u2019s utterance as\nreason to think S has that attitude. (Bach & Harnish\n1979: 15, italics in the original)\n\n\n(\u2018R-intend\u2019 is, as above, short for \u201creflexively\nintend\u201d). On this view, expressing is wholly a matter of\nhearer-directed intentions.\n\nThis proposal has the advantage of covering both the sincere and the\ninsincere case, but has the drawback of requiring a high level of\nsophistication. By contrast, Bernard Williams (2002: 74) has claimed\nthat a sincere assertion is simply the direct expression of\nbelief, in a more primitive and unsophisticated way. Insincere\nassertions are different. According to Williams (2002: 74), in an\nassertion, the speaker either gives a direct expression of\nbelief, or he intends the addressee to \u201ctake it\u201d\nthat he has the belief (cf. Owens 2006).\n\nPresumably, the intention mentioned is an intention about what the\nhearer is to believe about the speaker. In this case the objection\nthat too much sophistication is required is less pressing, since it\nonly concerns insincere assertions. However, Williams\u2019s idea (as\nin Grice 1969) has the opposite defect of not taking more\nsophistication into account. The idea, that the alternative to\nsincerity is the intention to make the hearer believe that the speaker\nbelieves what he asserts, is not general enough. For instance, there\nis double bluffing, where the speaker asserts what is true in order to\ndeceive the hearer, whom the speaker believes will expect the speaker\nto lie. Again, an insincere speaker S who asserts that\np may know that the hearer A knows that\nS does not believe that p, but may still intend to\nmake A believe that S does not know about\nA\u2019s knowledge, precisely by making the assertion that\np. There is no definitive upper limit to the sophistication\nof the deceiving speaker\u2019s calculations. In addition, the\nspeaker may simply be stonewalling, reiterating an assertion without\nany hope of convincing the addressee of anything.\n\nA more neutral way of trying to capture the relation between assertion\nand believing was suggested both by Max Black (1952) and by Davidson\n(1984: 268): in asserting that p the speaker\nrepresents herself as believing that p. This\nsuggestion appears to avoid the difficulties with the appeal to\nhearer-directed intentions.\n\nA somewhat related approach is taken by Mitchell S. Green (2007), who\nappeals to \u201cexpressive conventions\u201d. Grammatical moods can\nhave such conventions (2007: 150). According to Green (2007: 160), an\nassertion that p invokes a set of conventions according to\nwhich the speaker \u201ccan be represented as bearing the\nbelief-relation to p\u201d.\n\nAs one can represent oneself as believing, one can also represent\noneself as knowing. Inspired by Davidson\u2019s proposal, Peter Unger\n(1975: 253\u2013270) and Michael Slote (1979: 185) made the stronger\nclaim that in asserting that p the speaker represents\nherself as knowing that p. To a small extent this idea had been\nanticipated by G. E. Moore when claiming that the speaker\nimplies that she knows that p (1912 [1966: 63]).\n\nHowever, it is not so clear what representing oneself amounts to. It\nmust be a sense different from that in which one represents the\nworld as having certain features. The speaker who asserts\n\n(23)\nThere are black swans.\n\n\ndoes not also claim that she believes that there are black\nswans. It must apparently be some weaker sense of\n\u201crepresent\u201d, since it is not just a matter of\nbeing, as opposed to not being, fully explicit. If I am asked what I\nbelieve and I answer by uttering\n (23),\n I do represent myself as believing that there are black swans, just\nas I would have done by explicitly saying that I believe that\nthere are black swans. I do represent myself as believing that there\nare black swans, equivalently with asserting that I do. What I assert\nthen is false if I don\u2019t have the belief, despite the existence\nof black swans.\n\nOn the other hand, it must also be stronger than the sense of\n\u201crepresent\u201d by which an actor can be said to represent\nhimself as believing something on stage. The actor says\n\n(24)\nI\u2019m in the biology department.\n\n\nthereby representing himself as asserting that he is in the biology\ndepartment, since he represents himself as being a man who honestly\nasserts that he is in the biology department. By means of that, he in\none sense represents himself as believing that he is in the biology\ndepartment. But the audience not invited to believe that the\nspeaker, that is, the actor, has that belief.\n\nApparently, the relevant sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is not easy\nto specify. That it nevertheless tracks a real phenomenon is often\nclaimed to be shown by Moore\u2019s Paradox. This is the paradox that\nassertoric utterances of sentences such as\n\n(25)\nIt is raining but I don\u2019t believe that it is raining.\n\n\n(the omissive type of Moorean sentences) are distinctly odd, and even\nprima facie self-defeating, despite the fact that they may\nwell be true. Among the different types of account of Moore\u2019s\nParadox, Moore\u2019s own emphasizes the connection between asserting\nand believing. Moore\u2019s idea (1944: 175\u2013176; 1912 [1966:\n63]) was that the speaker in some sense implies that she\nbelieves what she asserts. So by asserting\n (25)\n the speaker induces a contradiction between what she asserts and what\nshe implies. This contradiction is then supposed to explain the\n oddity.[16]\n4.2 Communicative intentions\n\nTypically, the speaker who makes an assertion has hearer-directed\nintentions in performing a speech act. The speaker may intend\nthe hearer to come to believe something or other about the speaker, or\nabout something else, or intend the hearer to come to desire or intend\nto do something. Such intentions can concern institutional changes,\nbut need not. Intentions that are immediately concerned with\ncommunication itself, as opposed to ulterior goals, are called\ncommunicative intentions.\n\nThe idea of communicative intentions derives from Grice\u2019s (1957)\narticle \u2018Meaning\u2019, where Grice defined what it is for a\nspeaker to non-naturally mean something. Although Grice did\nnot explicitly attempt to define assertion, his ideas can be\nstraightforwardly transposed to provide a definition:\n\n(Gr-A)\nS asserts that p by the utterance u iff\nthere is a hearer H such that\n\n\ni.\nS intends u to produce in H the belief\nthat p\nii.\nS intends H to recognize that i\niii.\nS intends H to believe that p at least\npartly for the reason that i\n \n\n\nIn the early to mid 1960s Austin\u2019s speech act theory and\nGrice\u2019s account of communicative intentions began to merge. The\nconnection is discussed in Strawson 1964. Strawson inquired whether\nillocutionary force could be made overt by means of communicative\nintentions. He concluded that when it comes to highly conventionalized\nutterances, communicative intentions are largely irrelevant, but that\non the other hand, convention does not play much role for ordinary\nillocutionary types. Strawson also pointed out a difficulty with\nGrice\u2019s analysis: it may be the case that all three conditions\n(i-iii) are fulfilled, but that the speaker intends the hearer to\nbelieve that they aren\u2019t (for instance, if the speaker\nwants the hearer to believe that p for reasons altogether\nindependent from his making the statement).\n\nSuch intentions to mislead came to be called sneaky\nintentions (Grice 1969), and they constituted a problem for\nspeech act analyses based on communicative intentions. The idea was\nthat genuine communication is essentially open: the speaker\u2019s\ncommunicative intentions are meant to be fully accessible to the\nhearer. Sneaky intentions violate this requirement of openness, and\ntherefore apparently they must be ruled out one way or another.\nStrawson\u2019s own solution was to add a fourth clause about the\nspeaker\u2019s intention that the hearer recognize the third\nintention. However, that solution only invited a sneaky intention one\nlevel up (cf. Schiffer 1972: 17\u201342; Vlach 1981; Davis 1999).\n\nAnother solution was to make the intention reflexive. This\nwas proposed by Searle (1969), in the first full-blown analysis of\nillocutionary types made by appeal to communicative intentions. Searle\ncombined this with an appeal to social institutions as created by\nrules. We return to these in\n section 5.1.\n\nSearle criticized Grice for requiring the speaker to intend\nperlocutionary effects, such as what the speaker shall come\nto do or believe, pointing out that such intentions aren\u2019t\nessential (1969: 46\u20137). Instead, according to Searle, the\nspeaker intends to be understood, and also intends to achieve\nthis by means of the hearer\u2019s recognition of this very intention\nitself. Moreover, if the intention is recognized, it is also\nfulfilled: \u201cwe achieve what we try to do by getting our audience\nto recognize what we try to do\u201d (Searle 1969: 47). This\nreflexive intention is formally spelled out as follows:\n\n(Srl-I)\nS utters sentence T and means it (i.e., means\nliterally what he says) = S utters T and\n\n\na.\nS intends (i-1) the utterance U of T to\nproduce in H the knowledge (recognition, awareness) that the\nstates of affairs specified by (certain of) the rules of T\nobtain. (Call this the illocutionary effect, IE)\nb.\nS intends U to produce IE by means of the\nrecognition of i-1\nc.\nS intends that i-1 will be recognized in virtue of (by\nmeans of) H\u2019s knowledge of (certain of) the rules governing (the\nelements of) T (Searle 1969: 49\u201350).\n \n\n\nThe illocutionary effect IE is the effect of generating the state\nspecified in the constitutive rule. In the case of assertion, the\nspeaker intends that her utterance counts as an undertaking\nthat p represents an actual state of affairs, depending on\nthe constitutive rule (cf.\n section 5.1).\n\nBach and Harnish follow Searle in appealing to reflexive communicative\nintentions. On their analysis (1979: 42), assuming a speaker\nS and a hearer H,\n\n(BH-A)\nS asserts that p iff S expresses\n\n\ni.\nthe belief that p, and\nii.\nthe intention that H believe that p.\n \n\n\nAccording to Bach and Harnish\u2019s understanding, a speaker\nS expresses an attitude just in case S\nR-intends (reflexively intends) the hearer to take\nS\u2019s utterance as reason to think S has that\nattitude. They understand the reflexive nature of the intention pretty\nmuch like Searle. They say (1979: 15) that the intended effect of an\nact of communication is not just any effect produced by means of\nrecognition of the intention to produce a certain effect, it is\nthe recognition of that intention.\n\nThese appeals to reflexive intentions were later criticized, in\nparticular by Sperber and Wilson (1986 [1995:256\u2013257]). Their\npoint is that if an intention I has as sub-intentions both\nthe intention J and the intention that the hearer recognize\nI, this will yield an infinitely long sequence: the intention\nthat: J and the hearer recognize the intention that:\nJ and the hearer recognize the intention that: J and\n\u2026). If this is an intention content at all, it is not humanly\n graspable.[17]\n\nApart from the communicative intentions accounts of assertion, there\nare more general questions about what intentions are required of a\nspeaker in order for his utterance to qualify as an assertion. For\ninstance, must he intend it to be an assertion? Must it be\nmade voluntarily?\n5. Normative Accounts, Content-Directed\n5.1 Norms of assertion\n\nMost of the discussion on assertion during the past twenty years has\nconcerned norms of assertability. Simply put, philosophers aim to\ndetermine under which conditions it is epistemically permissible (or\nproper, warranted, correct, appropriate) to make an assertion.\n5.1.1 Modern approaches: correctness and warranted assertability\n\nPhilosophers have long been interested in analyzing what we mean when\nwe characterize an assertion as \u201ccorrect\u201d,\n\u201cjustified\u201d, \u201cproper\u201d,\n\u201cwarranted\u201d, \u201cassertible\u201d, or\n\u201cwarrantedly assertible\u201d. The latter notion was taken on\nboard in pragmatism, and in later forms of anti-realism. Dewey (1938)\nseems to have been the first to characterize truth in terms of\nassertoric correctness, with his notion of warranted\nassertibility, even though this idea had a clear affinity with\nthe verifiability principle of Moritz Schlick (1936). Dewey, following\nPeirce, regarded truth as the ideal limit of scientific inquiry (1938:\n345), and a proposition warrantedly asserted only when known\nin virtue of such an inquiry. Warranted assertibility is the property\nof a proposition for which such knowledge potentially exists\n(1938: 9). Dewey was later followed by, notably, Dummett (1976) and\nPutnam (1981). Common to them is the position that there cannot be\nanything more to truth than being supported by the best available\nevidence. In these early discussions, the strategy was that of getting\na handle on truth by means of an appeal to the notion of the\ncorrectness of an assertion, which was taken as more fundamental. On\nDummett\u2019s view, we do get a notion of truth distinct\nfrom the notion of a correct assertion only because of the\nsemantics of compound sentences (1976: 50\u201352). The\nquestion of what the correctness of an assertion consists in was not\nitself much discussed in earlier work, but became subject of\ndiscussion already in the 1980s, with the work of Boghossian and\nothers.\n5.1.2 Contemporary approaches: the norm of assertion\n\nThe contemporary wave of discussion about assertoric normativity is\nalmost exclusively content-directed; the norms concern the epistemic\nrelation between the speaker and the content of their\n assertion.[18]\n Williamson (1996, 2000) initiated this debate by proposing that\nassertion is governed by a single norm, of the format:\n\n(N)\nOne must: assert p only if p has\nC.\n\n\nAccording to this hypothesis, you are entitled to assert a proposition\nonly if that proposition has a certain unspecified property\nC. The (N)-schema formalizes the key philosophical question\nabout assertability: which epistemic property C that makes a\nproposition assertable?\n\nWilliamson\u2019s answer is that property C must be\nknowledge, i.e., being known by the speaker. If this is\nright, you can properly assert only what you know: assertion is\ngoverned by the knowledge-norm\n (KNA):\n\n(KNA)\nOne must: assert p only if one knows p.\n\n\n(Williamson 2000: 243). (KNA) is proposed as part of an account of\nassertion. Other norms have been proposed: the most prominent\nalternatives are the truth norm (TNA), the justification norm (JNA)\nand the belief norm (BNA):\n\n(TNA)\nOne must: assert p only if p.\n(JNA)\nOne must: assert p only if one is epistemically justified\nin believing p.\n(BNA)\nOne must: assert p only if one believes p.\n\n\nDetermining which of these norms governs assertion depends (at least\nin part) on what we mean by hypothesizing that assertion is governed\nby a simple norm by N. In the next section\n (5.1.3),\n we clarify what philosophers typically mean when they say that\nN governs assertions. In the subsequent section\n (5.1.4),\n we review the various accounts of which specific norm governs\nassertion (i.e., the different views as to which property\nC makes a proposition assertable).\n5.1.3 What kind of norm?\n\nWilliamson\u2019s initial framing of the debate on the norm of\nassertion takes for granted a number of assumptions: for instance,\nthat there is a single norm, that it is constitutive of assertion,\nthat all and only assertions are subject to it. In subsequent work,\nsome of these assumptions have been questioned. Here we limit\nourselves to list each assumption (ignoring the numerous objections\nthat affect them). The interested reader will find a discussion of the\ncase for and against each assumption in the supplementary document\n Which Kind of Norm?.\n\n(A1)\nSpecificity: N applies specifically to\nassertion: only assertions are subject to N.\n(A1*)\nDirectness: Assertions are subject to N\ndirectly, qua assertions.\n\n\nBy Specificity, N is a norm that regulates only one\nspecies of action: asserting. In this sense, it is specific to\nassertion. It governs the making of assertions in general, and nothing\nelse. Directness is closely connected to\nSpecificity. It clarifies that assertions are subject to\nN only in virtue of the fact that they are assertions.\n\n(A2)\nUniqueness: There is only one norm of assertion:\nassertion is only subject to N\n(A2*)\nIndirectness: Assertions are subject to other normative\nstandards, but only indirectly (not in virtue of the fact that they\nare assertions).\n\n\nThe \u201cuniqueness assumption\u201d holds that assertion is\nsubject to a single norm. Indirectness specifies that\nUniqueness is compatible with recognizing that there are\nother norms that apply to assertion, albeit only indirectly\n(Williamson 1996: 489). For instance, an assertion can follow\nN (e.g., satisfy the Justification Norm JNA) and violate\nstandard of politeness, morality, legality, etc. Unlike N,\nthese other normative standards are not specific to assertion, since\nthey apply also to other actions (questions, orders, as well as\nnon-linguistic actions).\n\nAn important corollary of Indirectness is that whether an\nassertion is all-things-considered permissible or not may depend on\nfactors that are independent of N. When you say something\noffensive, or reveal a secret that you agreed to keep, you may follow\nN and yet make an (all-things-considered) impermissible\nassertion. And when you lie to save a life, you may violate N\nand make an assertion that is (all-things-considered) permissible.\n\n(A3)\nIndividuation: N uniquely identifies assertion:\nassertion is the only speech act that is only subject to\nN.\n\n\nAccording to the Individuation assumption, the norm of\nassertion is individuating: assertion can be defined as the unique\nspeech act who is subject to this unique norm (Williamson 2000: 241;\nGoldberg 2015: 25; Montminy 2013a). It should be emphasized here that\nit is being subject to the norm that characterizes assertion,\nnot conforming to the norm. An assertion that violates the\nnorm is still an assertion. A definition of assertion in terms of its\nnorm would read as:\n\n(D)\nS asserts that p iff in saying p,\nS is subject to the obligation imposed by N.\n\n\nIf\n (A3)\n holds, an important motivation for identifying N is that it\nwill provide us with a definition of assertion. Once we determine what\nN is (say, JNA), we can disambiguate the content of this\ndefinition (say, \u201cthe only speech act who is only subject to\nJNA\u201d).\n\n(A4)\nEssentiality: Being subject to N is essential to\nassertion as an action type: Necessarily, assertion is subject to\nN.\n\n\nThe Essentiality assumption goes beyond\nIndividuation: Individuation allows that assertion\nis only actually individuated by N, and that it could have\nbeen governed by some other norm. By contrast,\n (A4)\n holds that assertions could not exist and be governed by a different\nnorm: if assertion were subject to a different norm, it would be a\ndifferent speech act. Nothing but an assertion could violate the norm,\nif the\n (A3)\n and\n (A4)\n properties hold.\n\n(A5)\nPermissibility: N establishes a condition for\npermissible assertion: p is permissible to assert only if\np meets C.\n\n\nBy\n (A5),\n an assertion is permissible (appropriate, epistemically proper,\nwarranted, correct\u2014depending on one\u2019s favorite\nterminology) only if it meets condition C, and impermissible\nif it does not meet C. Permission is related to the negative\nevaluation of assertions: assertions who violate N are\nprima facie faulty, and criticizable (qua violations of\nN). Permissibility only establishes what is\nnecessary for permissible assertion, not what is\n sufficient.[19]\n\nMost theorists take for granted that N is the\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d norm of assertion, and some explicitly\nadvocate\n (A6).[20]\n\n(A6)\nConstitutivity: N is the constitutive norm of\nassertion.\n\n\nHowever, there is substantial (and often unacknowledged) disagreement\nabout what constitutivity amounts to (for more the debate surrounding\neach of these assumptions, see the supplementary document\n Which Kind of Norm?).\n5.1.4 Which Norm of Assertion?\n\nFor the most part, the literature on norms of assertion has concerned\nthe question of which specific norm governs assertion, and\nwhat are the reasons for favoring one candidate norm over another.\nBelow, we briefly go through the main candidates from the\nliterature.\nThe knowledge norm\n\n(KNA)\nOne must: assert p only if one knows p.\n\n\nOver and above Williamson,\n (KNA)\n has been favored by DeRose (2002), Reynolds (2002), Adler (2002:\n275), Hawthorne (2004), Stanley (2005), Engel (2008), Schaffer (2008),\nand Turri (2010), among others.\n\nIn addition to direct intuitions about the appropriateness of specific\nsentences, proponents of the knowledge norm have adduced indirect\nevidence in the form of intuitions about conversational patterns,\nclaiming that these patterns are best explained by the acceptance of\nthe knowledge norm. Williamson himself appeals to such patterns, such\nas those arising from Moorean Assertions\n (26),\n Lottery Assertions\n (27),\n and Challenges\n (28):\n\n(26)\nIt is raining, but I don\u2019t know that it is raining.\n(27)\nYour ticket did not win.\n(28)\nHow do you know that?\n\n\nConcerning the first, Williamson (2000: 253) claims that an utterance\nof\n (26)\n is just as odd as any ordinary Moorean sentence involving belief,\nsuch as\n (25)\n above. The oddity of\n (26)\n can be explained by appeal to the knowledge norm, and this is taken\nby supporters of\n (KNA)\n to be a datum in its favor. By\n (KNA),\n (26) is proper only if the speaker knows that the proposition\nexpressed by\n (26)\n is true. Since knowledge distributes over conjunction, this means\nthat the speaker should know that it is raining and also that she does\nnot know that it is raining. Since knowledge is factive, this\ngenerates a contradiction: it follows that an assertion of\n (26)\n cannot be proper, and this explains its oddity.\n\nSimilarly,\n (KNA)\n seems well positioned to explain the oddity of asserting\n (27)\n merely on probabilistic grounds. Suppose that a (fair) lottery with a\nlarge number of tickets has been held; only one ticket has won.\nB has a ticket, but neither A nor B knows\nthe result. A asserts\n (27)\n on merely probabilistic grounds. Although the probability that the\nticket has won is very low (and one can get it arbitrarily low, short\nof zero, by increasing the number of tickets in the lottery), it is\nintuitively incorrect for A to tell\n (27)\n to B (Williamson 2000: 246\u2013249). No probability short\nof 1 seems to authorize A\u2019s utterance of\n (27).\n Since A does not know that\n (27)\n is true,\n (KNA)\n explains the unacceptability of A\u2019s utterance.\n\nFinally, in standard contexts, it is perfectly appropriate to\nchallenge an assertion with questions like\n (28),\n but\n (28)\n presupposes that the speaker knows that what she says is true.\n (KNA)\n is well positioned to explain why this presupposition is appropriate:\nif speakers are only entitled to assert what they know, then it is\nwithin the hearer\u2019s conversational rights to assume (and\npresuppose) that the speaker knows that what they say is true. Further\nconversational patterns supporting\n (KNA)\n have been proposed, e.g., by Benton (2011).\n\nThe claim that\n (KNA)\n is supported by these conversational patterns has been extensively\ncriticized. The most common line is that the available data can be\nexplained equally well (if not better) by competing accounts. For\ninstance, several authors argue that the oddity of Moorean Assertions\nand Lottery Assertions can be explained by appeal to a justification\n norm.[21]\n Others have noted that these conversational patterns may be explained\nby appealing to more general principles, rather than assertoric norms\nspecifically. For instance, it has been argued that Lottery Assertions\nand Moorean Assertions are improper because they violate more general\n(Gricean) conversational\n principles.[22]\n\nA different criticism comes from Sosa (2009), who notes that\n (KNA)\u2019s\n explanation of Moorean assertions fails to generalize as it should,\nbecause\n (KNA)\n is unable to explain \u201cdubious assertions\u201d: cases in which\nthe speaker asserts p while admitting that he doesn\u2019t\nknow whether he knows that p (but see Benton 2013, Montminy\n2013a). Finally, several authors have questioned the assumption that\nit is always improper to assert that one\u2019s ticket is a loser on\npurely probabilistic\n grounds.[23]\n\nThe argument from challenges like\n (28)\n is surely the least compelling. First, to meet the challenge raised\nby\n (28),\n it would be sufficient for the speaker to show that she has good\nreasons to believe that what she said is true (Lackey 2007:\n610; Kvanvig 2009: 143; McKinnon & Turri 2013). It does not seem,\nby contrast, that the speaker has to prove that she knows (rather than\nmerely believe) that what she said is true. Second, taking the\nargument seriously proves too much. Consider\n (29):\n\n(29)\nAre you sure?\n(30)\nHow can you be certain?\n\n\nSince\n (29)\n and\n (30)\n are also natural ways to challenge an assertion, by the same logic,\nwe should conclude that assertion is also governed by a certainty\nrule. We could extend this to other challenges (Is that true?). So the\nchallenge argument doesn\u2019t seem to show a primacy of knowledge\nover alternative rules.\n\nA general problem with the appeal to conversational patterns is that\nthey don\u2019t seem to favor specifically normative views over\ncorresponding non-normative views. For instance, it appears that any\nlinguistic phenomenon that can be explained by appeal to a knowledge\nnorm can be equally well explained by appeal to the view that\nasserters represent themselves as knowing what they say, although\nthere is no norm (cf. Pagin 2016b; D. Black 2018). Combine this with\nextraneous, non-assertion-specific norms. That A\u2019s lottery\nassertion\n (27)\n is bad can then be explained by appeal to self-representation of\nknowledge, together with the general moral norm that it is wrong to\nmislead hearers.\n\nMany objections against\n (KNA)\n are based on the idea that its requirements are too strong. First,\nGettiered assertions. Suppose that you have a justified true\nbelief that falls short of knowledge. For instance, you walk into a\ncaf\u00e9, look at the clock, and conclude that it\u2019s 4.35; but\nyour belief is only accidentally true because (unbeknownst to you) the\nclock has been stuck at 4.35 for several days. If someone asks you the\ntime, it seems perfectly appropriate for you to respond \u201c4.35\npm\u201d. However, by making such an assertion, you would be\nviolating\n (KNA),\n which intuitively speaks against it (Lackey 2007: 596; Kvanvig 2009:\n146\u20137; Coffman 2014: 36).\n\nSimilar objections arise in relation to the intuitive permissibility\nof unlucky assertions: assertions that you have excellent\nreasons to believe to be true, but that happen to be false. Since the\nproblem with unlucky assertions is that\n (KNA)\n entails\n (TNA)\n (it only allows true assertions), we will discuss it below, as we\nconsider objections to\n (TNA).\n\nLackey objects that\n (KNA)\n fails to accommodate selfless assertions. She presents\nseveral examples: one involves a teacher, Stella, who firmly believes\nin creationism, but is aware that the scientific consensus is that\nhumans evolved from apes. Stella recognizes that Darwinism is\nsupported by stronger empirical evidence, but this is not enough to\nshake her firm belief in creationism. Suppose that she tells her\nstudents:\n\n(31)\nHomo sapiens evolved from Homo erectus.\n\n\nIntuitively, it would be appropriate for Stella, as a teacher, to\nassert\n (31).\n However,\n (KNA)\n predicts that\n (31)\n is incorrect, because Stella does not believe, and therefore does not\nknow, that\n (31)\n is true. Selfless assertion have generated a lively debate, mostly\ninvolving attempts to explain their propriety within a\n (KNA)-framework\n (see Montminy 2013a, Turri 2015, Mili\u0107 2017).\n\nFurther objections concern so-called unsafe assertions, where\nthe speaker does know what is asserted, but would easily have made the\nassertion in a similar situation without\n knowledge.[24]\n\nA few authors who sympathize with\n (KNA)\n have emphasized the role of the hearer. Their proposals are similar\nto\n (KNA),\n but set the condition in relation to the transmission of knowledge to\nthe hearer. An example is Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (2004:\n156):\n\n(KNA-T)\nOne must: assert p only if one\u2019s audience comes\nthereby to be in a position to know that p.\n\n\nSimilar norms have also been proposed by Pelling (2013a) and by\nHinchman (2013). Garc\u00eda-Carpintero suggests that his version is\npreferable to Williamson\u2019s because it brings out the social,\ncommunicative function of language (but see Willard-Kyle forthcoming\nfor objections to KNA-T).\n[25]\nThe truth norm\n\nMost alternatives to the knowledge norm that are weaker than\n (KNA):\n they require less than knowledge for proper assertion. Weiner (2005)\nand Whiting (2013, 2015) propose a truth norm (cf. also Alston\n2000):\n\n(TNA)\nAssert that p only if p is true.\n\n\nJust like the knowledge norm, the truth norm is factive: both entail\nthat you can assert a proposition only if it is true. This generates a\nproblem concerning the intuitive appropriateness of unlucky\nassertions. To illustrate, imagine that you have had a cat for\nseveral years. During a conversation, a friend asks you if you have\nany pets at home, and you reply:\n\n(32)\nI have a cat at home.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to you, however, some thieves broke into your house and\nstole everything you have, including your cat. Since you could not\npossibly have foreseen the eventuality of such an absurd theft, it\nseems that your assertion is appropriate: in response to your\nfriend\u2019s question,\n (32)\n is simply the right thing to say. However,\n (KNA)\n and\n (TNA)\n give a different verdict: they predict that\n (32)\n is an inappropriate response. What\u2019s more,\n (TNA)\n (but not\n (KNA))\n predicts that the appropriate reply would have been to assert the\nnegation of\n (32),\n namely that you don\u2019t have a cat at home. But again, such a\n\u201clucky assertion\u201d would be intuitively inappropriate:\nsince you have no reason to believe that your cat was stolen, in\nsaying that you don\u2019t have a pet you would be\n lying.[26]\n\nProponents of\n (KNA)\n and\n (TNA)\n tend to concede that unlucky assertions (and Gettiered\nassertions) are intuitively appropriate, and that lucky assertions are\nintuitively inappropriate. Their standard defense strategy is to\ninvoke some distinctions that explain away their incorrect\npredictions. Williamson (2000: 256\u2013257) suggests that making\nunlucky and Gettiered assertions is reasonable, and this is why\nassertions like\n (32)\n usually don\u2019t warrant criticism. However, here the prediction\nthat uttering\n (32)\n is reasonable is made by general observations about rationality, and\nnot by\n (KNA)\n itself. If\n (KNA)\u2019s\n job is to tell us which assertions are appropriate and which are not,\nit is not clear how these observations really help its case, since\nthere are other norms (such as\n (JNA))\n that are able to make this prediction without appeal to independent\nepistemic standards.\n\nA parallel solution has been delineated by DeRose, who draws a\ndistinction between primary and secondary propriety. Primary\npropriety is just what a rule says: when a rule prescribes to\nf only if C, it is primarily proper to f if\nC, and primarily improper to f if not C.\nSecondary propriety is dictated by whether you have reasons to think\nyou are following the rule. If you f because you reasonably\nbelieve that C, but C is accidentally false, your\naction is primarily improper but secondarily proper, and doesn\u2019t\ndeserve blame. If you f although you reasonably believe that\nC is false, but C is accidentally true, your\nassertion is primarily proper but secondarily improper, and\ndoesn\u2019t deserve praise. This strategy helps defend\n (TNA)\n and\n (KNA)\n against the devised counterexamples. Unlucky and Gettiered assertions\nare primarily improper but secondarily proper, and that\u2019s why\nthey don\u2019t deserve blame. Lucky assertions are primarily proper\nbut secondarily improper, and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t\ndeserve praise.\n\nSeveral authors reject this distinction between primary and secondary\n propriety.[27]\n Most of them think that this distinction is spurious. If the job of\nan epistemic norm is to identify the one epistemic standard C\nfrom which it is appropriate to assert, then it is not clear that\nappealing to secondary propriety, epistemic excuses or reasonableness\nis a legitimate move, given that more economic alternatives are\navailable. Reasonably thinking that you are in C (secondarily\nfollowing the rule) is itself an epistemic state; if being in such a\nstate epistemically entitles you to assert, such permissibility should\nbe built into the\n norm.[28]\n\nAccepting the distinction between primary and secondary propriety\ninduces a problem for the intuitive support for the various theories.\nA large part of the intuitions that serve to support one or the other\nnorm theory relies on raw intuitions about what one should or\nshouldn\u2019t assert in some situation, or what is proper or\nimproper to assert there. If there are several ways an assertion can\nbe proper or improper, then it is not easy to see which concept of\npropriety is being tracked by these intuitions. The idea is that a\nparticular intuition that seems to disconfirm a particular normative\ntheory can be explained away by saying that it does not in fact track\nthe primary propriety, but instead only some secondary propriety.\nSince intuitions don\u2019t come labeled as \u201cprimary\u201d and\n\u201csecondary\u201d, there is a risk of a substantial\nunderdetermination of theory by data (stressed by Pagin 2016b): two\ntheorists need not agree about whether or not an intuition about a\nparticular case supports a certain theory.\n\nA problem persists even if we reject the primary/secondary\ndistinction. As noted, everyone agrees that assertions are governed by\nvarious norms: moral, prudential, conversational, rules of etiquette.\nWhen does an intuition track the intended notion of a proper\nassertion, and when something else altogether? Kvanvig (2011: 235) and\nEngel (2008: 52\u201354) have drawn attention to this. According to\nKvanvig, intuitions typically concern whether assertions are\nall-things-considered appropriate. But an assertion may be\n\u201call-things-considered appropriate\u201d without being\n\u201cepistemic appropriate\u201d (or the other way around). Since\nwe do not have a reliable method for telling apart intuitions about\n\u201coverall appropriateness\u201d from intuitions about\n\u201cepistemic appropriateness\u201d, it is often unclear to which\nextent a given set of intuitions supports or undermines a given theory\n(cf. Hawthorne & Stanley 2008: 585\u20136). To address this\nproblem, Greenberg (forthcoming) proposes to reframe the debate in\nterms of epistemic norms constraining action, rather than\nassertion.\n\nComplex refinements of\n (TNA)\n have been proposed, too. MacFarlane (2014: 103) adopts a truth norm,\nbut requires it to be qualified as being reflective. This\nmeans, in the context of MacFarlane\u2019s relativism, that\nthe proposition should be true in the context of utterance, as\nassessed from the same context of\n utterance.[29]\n According to MacFarlane, the truth norm needs to be complemented by a\nretraction rule that enjoins the speaker to retract the\nassertion if it turns out not be true (cf. Dummett 1991: 165), in a\ncontext of assessment:\n\n(RNA)\nRetract an (unretracted) assertion if it turns out not to be\ntrue.\n\n\nThis rule is also stated in the context of MacFarlane\u2019s\nrelativism, with respect to a context of use and a context of\nassessment. According to the resulting view, assertion is governed\njointly by the (reflective) truth norm and the retraction rule.\nRescorla (2009a), who defends a commitment account of assertion (see\n section 6.1),\n argues there is no norm at all for proper making of\nassertions. There are only norms that govern later reactions. He\nproposes three alternatives to\n (RNA),\n which share the idea that when a speaker is challenged with respect\nto an assertion he has made, he must either defend the assertion or\nelse retract it (Rescorla 2009a: 103\u2013105; cf. Rescorla\n2009b).\nThe justification norms\n\nSeveral authors have argued that assertability requires justification,\nrather than belief or knowledge. A standard formulation would be:\n\n(JNA)\nAssert only that for which you have proper justification.\n\n\nWhat \u201cjustification\u201d is taken to refer to varies between\nauthors. Douven (2006, 2009) and Lackey (2007, 2008) argue for a norm\nof rational belief. Note that\n (JNA)\n does not require that you believe what you say: all that it\nrequires is that it is (or would be) rational for you to\nbelieve it. As such,\n (JNA)\n classifies selfless assertions (which are disbelieved, but\nrational to believe) as appropriate, a prediction that Lackey (2007)\ntakes to be a crucial advantage of\n (JNA).\n\nDifferent conversational contexts may require different degrees of\njustification. For instance, suppose that you are serving your friend\na curry that you just defrosted. You remember that you prepared it for\na vegan dinner over a month ago, but you\u2019re not absolutely sure.\nIf your friend has a mild dislike for cheese,\n (33)\n may be an appropriate thing to say; not so much if your friend has a\ndeadly allergy to lactose:\n\n(33)\nThere is no cheese in this curry.\n\n\nTo accommodate this sort of intuitions, some authors have proposed\ncontext-sensitive versions of\n (JNA).\n Gerken (2012, 2014, 2017) says that an assertion must be based\n\u201con a degree of discursive justification for believing that\np that is adequate\u201d relative to the conversational\ncontext. He also argues that the notion of justification is best\nunderstood in internalist terms: a speaker asserting p is\njustified only if they would be able to consciously articulate their\nreasons in support of p. McKinnon (2013, 2015) also defends a\nversion of\n (JNA)\n that is context-sensitive. She argues that one may assert that\np only if (i) the speaker has supportive reasons for\np, and (ii) the relevant conventional and pragmatic elements\nof the context of assertion are present. On this view, the pragmatic\nfeatures of the context have an effect on which epistemic support is\nneeded. Pragmatic features can regard the stakes involved\n(how much depends practically on the truth of what is asserted) or\npedagogical requirements (in case the speaker is a teacher\nwho is required to teach what is rational to believe; McKinnon 2015:\nSection 4.4).\n\nIf justification comes in degrees, perhaps some propositions are more\nassertable than others. According to an influential view (Jackson\n1974, 565, cf. Lewis 1976, 297), the degree to which a proposition is\nassertable is a function of its probability. But Sam Carter\n(forthcoming) shows that this view makes systematically incorrect\npredictions. He suggests that assertability is a matter of\nnormality instead: \u201casserting p is more\nappropriate than asserting q, for a speaker in evidential\nstate E, iff amongst the worlds compatible with E, p is more\nnormal than q\u201d (in turn, normality has to do with what\nis compatible with our evidence-based expectations; cf. Carter\nforthcoming: \u00a75 for a formal definition).\n\n(JNA)\n does not explicitly forbid insincere assertions (assertions that are\nbelieved to be false). Some find this feature unattractive, and prefer\nto amend\n (JNA)\n so as to introduce a belief-requirement, as in\n (JBNA):\n\n(JBNA)\nAssert that p only if you justifiably believe that\np.\n\n\nSince\n (JBNA)\n requires both justification and belief, it entails that both\n (JNA)\n and\n (BNA)\n are true. But how should we characterize justification for\nthe purpose of this more demanding norm? For Kvanvig (2009, 2011), the\nrelevant notion is knowledge-level justification: \u201cthe kind [of\njustification] that is sufficient for knowledge in the presence of\nungettiered true belief\u201d (2009: 156); a stronger version of this\nrequirement (would-be-knowledge) is defended by Coffman (2014).\n\nA datum that justification rules may have trouble explaining is the\nwrongness of false assertions. There seems to be something inherently\ndefective about false assertions, and there is clearly a sense in\nwhich true, justified assertions are more valuable than false, equally\njustified ones. But\n (JNA)\n and\n (JBNA)\n have no resources to explain what is defective about falsity. In\nresponse, Marsili (2018) notes that proponents of non-factive accounts\ncan avail themselves of the notion of an assertion\u2019s aim: when\nwe make an assertion, we purport to describe the world as it is; our\nassertion\u2019s purported goal is met only if the assertion is true.\nOn this view, false assertions are not impermissible, but are still\ndefective, because they fail to meet their purported aim.\n\nThere are views that come very close to justification rules. Maitra\nand Weatherson (2010: 112) propose what they call The Evidence\nResponsiveness Rule: that one assert that p only if\none\u2019s attitude towards p is properly responsive to the\nevidence (they also propose to complement it with an action\nrule, that it is proper to assert that p only if acting\nas if p is \u201cthe thing for you to do\u201d). Smithies\n(2012) defends the view that p is assertable only if you have\na justification to believe that you are in a position to know that\np (cf. Koethe 2009, Rosenkranz forthcoming). This version of\n (JNA)\n restores a guiding normative role for knowledge, while accommodating\nmany of the intuitions that motivate a preference for\n (JNA)\n or\n (KNA)\n (for a critique, see M. Smith 2012).\nOther proposals\n\nBelief norms are the weakest norms on the market:\n\n(BNA)\nAssert only what you believe.\n\n\nThe belief norm is explicitly stated by Hindriks (2007) and Bach\n(2008: 77). If one substitutes \u2018say\u2019 for\n\u2018assert\u2019, this is close to a reformulations of\nGrice\u2019s second submaxim of Quality (\u201cDo not say what you\nbelieve to be false\u201d (Grice 1989: 27).\n\nIntuitively,\n (BNA)\n is too permissive: it allows us to assert whatever we believe, even\nif we have no evidence but a hunch to support our claim. To explain\naway this prediction, advocates of\n (BNA)\n typically add that while\n (BNA)\n is the only norm that is specific to assertion (and regulates\nassertion directly, cf.\n (A1)\n and\n (A2)),\n it is not the only norm that regulates it. Since assertions\nnecessarily express a belief, and appropriate belief (and/or\npractical action) is allegedly governed by a knowledge-norm,\n (KNA)\n ultimately determines which assertions all-things-considered\nappropriate (Hindriks 2007; Bach 2008; Montminy 2013a).\n\nAll the alternatives to the knowledge norm considered so far require\nless than knowledge for proper assertion. A stronger\nrequirement has been suggested by Stanley (2008):\n\n(EC-A)\nAssert only what is epistemically certain.\n\n\nHere one is epistemically certain of a proposition p\n\n\nif and only if one knows that p (or is in a position to know\nthat p) on the basis of evidence that gives one the highest\ndegree of justification for one\u2019s belief that p. (2008:\n35)\n\n\nAccording to Stanley, since the certainty norm requires more than just\nknowledge, everything that can be explained by appeal to the knowledge\nnorm can also be explained by appeal to the certainty\n norm.[30]\n\nGoldberg (2015) argues that the norm of assertion hypothesis can\nexplain why we have a (pro tanto) epistemic entitlement believe what\nwe are told. He identifies some requirements that are needed to meet\nthis desideratum. One is that the norm of assertion is robustly\nepistemic, and strong enough to warrant testimonial belief (2015: 96).\nAnother is that it must be common knowledge between speaker\nand hearer that the speaker\u2019s assertion is subject to this norm.\nA further requirement (2015: 8) is that the speaker\nauthorizes the hearer to defer back to the speaker the\nresponsibility of meeting challenges to the assertion. Together, these\nassumptions should be able to explain why beliefs based on testimony\nare pro tanto justified.\nExperimental evidence\n\nMost authors who write about the norm of assertion appeal to their own\nintuitions. However, this is an area where experimental data is highly\nrelevant. If the aim is to describe a real-word communicative act,\nrather than a purely idealized philosopher\u2019s construct, it\nfollows a good theory of assertion should make predictions that are\nconsistent with our actual practice: it should deem appropriate the\nassertions that ordinary speakers deem appropriate, and inappropriate\nthe ones that they criticize as inappropriate. If this is right,\ncompeting accounts can be tested empirically against the intuitions of\ncompetent speakers of the language.\n\nEmpirical research on the norm of assertion was initiated by Turri.\nHis (2013) study aims to determine whether people\u2019s\nassertability judgments are better predicted by a factive norm, like\n (KNA)\n or\n (TNA),\n or a non-factive one, like\n (JNA)\n or\n (BNA).\n Turri reports the results of six experiments, primarily investigating\njudgments about unlucky assertions (false assertions that the speaker\nreasonably believes to be true). In the first experiment, Maria\nincorrectly thinks that she has a 1990 Rolex in her watch collection,\nbecause this is what her inventory says. When a friend asks Maria if\nshe has that particular Rolex, participants are asked: \u201cShould\nMaria tell her guest that she has a 1990 Rolex in her\ncollection?\u201d [Yes/No]. Participants overwhelmingly selected the\nnegative option (No), even when different factors were manipulated\n(the control questions, what is at stake, the response options, etc.),\napparently providing robust evidential support for factive accounts.\nTurri has since conducted several more studies, accumulating an\nimpressive body of evidence supporting factive accounts of assertion\nin general and the knowledge-norm in particular (for a review, see\nTurri 2017), including studies on other potential counterexamples to\n (KNA),\n like selfless assertions (2015a), and Gettiered\nassertions (2016).\n\nIt seemed that the debate was settled in favor of the knowledge rule,\nuntil new studies came out that pointed in the opposite direction.\nReuter and Br\u00f6ssel (2019) argue that two factors likely skewed\nthe results in favor of factive accounts in Turri\u2019s (2013)\nseminal study. First, the protagonist (Maria) has a defeater against\nher belief: she is aware that her inventory is occasionally\nmistaken. Second, participants were asked what Maria should\nsay, but it would seem more appropriate to ask whether her assertion\nwas permissible. Manipulating these factors reverted the\nresults: a majority of participants gave responses aligning with\nnon-factive accounts. The authors then conducted new experiments\ninvolving both lucky assertions (true, but not justified) and\nunlucky assertions (false, but justified), finding that\n (JNA)\n was reliably a better predictor of assertability than any of its\nfactive rivals\n (TNA,\n KNA).\n\nKneer (2017) also found solid evidence that\n (JNA)\n is a better predictor of assertability judgments than\n (KNA),\n TNA, and\n (BNA).\n In a first experiment, he tested Gettiered assertions and\nunlucky assertions, measuring assertability with different\nprompts: he asked whether the protagonist \u201cshould say\np\u201d, whether she \u201cis permitted to say\np\u201d, and if saying p is\n\u201cappropriate\u201d. In both the Gettiered condition\nand the unlucky condition, the overwhelming majority of\nparticipants considered p assertable, but not known. Kneer\nconcludes that \u201cknowledge quite clearly doesn\u2019t constitute\nthe norm of assertion\u201d. The other experiments were therefore\ndesigned to verify whether\n (JNA) makes\n more reliable predictions. Experiments 2 and 3 found robust evidence\nthat\n (JNA) is\n a better predictor of assertability judgments than\n (KNA),\n both in Gettier assertions and unlucky assertions,\neven when different factors (like the response options or the kind of\nepistemic support) are manipulated. Experiment 4 shows that\n (JNA) is\n a better predictor of assertability judgments than\n (BNA):\n people judge that \u201chaving a hunch\u201d that p is\ntrue is not good enough ground to assert p. Like Reuter and\nBr\u00f6ssel, Kneer concludes that\n (JNA),\n rather than\n (KNA),\n is better supported by the empirical evidence. In a subsequent study,\nKneer (2021) found that these results are stable across different\ncultures.\n\nThese results are at odds with the initial findings by Turri and\ncolleagues. Given the contrasting data available, how can we determine\nwhich account is best supported by empirical evidence? To answer this\nquestion, Marsili and Wiegmann (2021) note that, in all their\ndifferences, Turri\u2019s studies share a central methodological\naspect: they explore laypeople intuitions by asking a sample of\nsubjects to judge what a particular agent should do in a\ngiven scenario, before the protagonist makes the assertion;\nKneer, Reuter and Br\u00f6ssel adopt instead different prompts and\ntense structures. Marsili and Wiegmann argue that the divergent\nresults are the predictable bi-product of a flaw in the questioning\nmethod employed in the former set of studies. They note that\n\u201cshould\u201d can be interpreted in two ways:\nteleologically (or instrumentally), when it indicates what\nyou should do to achieve your aims, and deontologically, when\nit indicates what you should do to live up to some norms or\nobligations. The authors found experimental evidence that participants\nin Turri\u2019s studies interpreted the test questions\nteleologically, which undermines a factive interpretation of the\nresults. Furthermore, they identify measures that can be introduced to\nprompt the intended (deontological) reading of the test question,\nfinding that when these measures are implemented into Turri\u2019s\nvignettes, participants\u2019 judgments overwhelmingly align with\nnon-factive views like\n (JNA).\n\nIt would therefore seem that the latest studies have tipped the scale\nin favor of non-factive views like\n (JNA).\n However, further research will be needed to settle the disagreement\non empirical grounds.\n5.2 Conventions\n\nAustin held that illocutionary acts as opposed to perlocutionary acts\nare conventional, in the sense that they can be made explicit\nby the so-called performative formula (Austin 1962: 103). According to\nAustin, one can say \u201cI argue that\u201d or \u201cI warn you\nthat\u201d but not \u201cI convince you that\u201d or \u201cI\nalarm you that\u201d. Presumably, the idea was that a speech act type\nis conventional just if there exists a convention by which an\nutterance of a sentence of a certain kind ensures (if uptake is\nsecured) that a speech act of that type is performed. Austin probably\nthought that in virtue of the performative formulas this condition is\nmet by illocutionary but not by perlocutionary act types.\n\nThe more general claim that illocutionary force is correlated by\nconvention with sentence type has been advocated by Dummett (1973\n[1981: 302, 311]). On this view, it is a convention that declarative\nsentences are used for assertion, interrogative for questions and\nimperative for commands and requests. Similar views have been put\nforward by Searle (1969) and Kot\u2019\u00e1tko (1998), and the\nidea has been more recently defended by K\u00f6lbel (2010). According\nto Searle (1969: 38, 40), illocutionary acts are conventional, and the\nconventions in question govern the use of so-called force-indicating\ndevices (Searle 1969: 64) specific to each\n language.[31]\n\nHowever, the view that illocutionary acts types are conventional in\nthis sense has met with much opposition. Strawson (1964:\n153\u2013154) objected early on that ordinary illocutionary acts can\nbe performed without relying on any convention to identify the force,\nfor instance when using a declarative sentence like \u201cThe ice\nover there is very thin\u201d for a warning. This kind of criticism,\ndirected against Dummett, has later been reinforced by Robert J.\nStainton (1996, 2006), stressing that in appropriate contexts,\nsub-sentential phrases like \u201cJohn\u2019s father\u201d\n(pointing at a man) or \u201cvery fast\u201d (looking at a car) can\nbe used to make assertions, and gives linguistic arguments why not all\nsuch uses can be treated as cases of ellipsis (that is, as cases of\nleaving out parts of a well-formed sentence that speaker and hearer\ntacitly aware of). If Strawson and Stainton are right, convention\nisn\u2019t necessary for making assertions.\n\nMoreover, Davidson (1979, 1984) stressed that no conventional sign\ncould work as a force indicator in this sense, since any conventional\nsign could be used (and would be used) in insincere utterances, where\nthe corresponding force was missing, including cases of deception,\njokes, impersonation and other theatrical performances. Basically the\nsame point is made by Bach and Harnish (1979: 122\u2013127). If\nDavidson, and Bach and Harnish are right, then conventions are also\nnot sufficient (but see K\u00f6lbel 2010 for an argument against this\nview).\n\nWilliamson (1996, 239) has argued that that speech acts defined by\nconstitutive rules (like assertion, in his own view) cannot be\nconventional. However, Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (2019) has shown that\nthis position is controversial. The situation is complicated by the\nfact that the general question of when a convention, or rule of any\nkind, is in force for a speaker, is substantial and complex\n(for more on the relation of assertion to convention, Green\n2020a).\n6. Normative Accounts, Hearer-Directed\n6.1 Commitment\n\nMaking an assertion has normative consequences. To characterize the\nsocial dimension of assertion, some authors focus on the distinctive\nresponsibilities\n (\u201ccommitments\u201d[32])\n that a communicator takes on when they claim that something is the\ncase. We shall begin by reviewing two main ways to understand what\nassertoric commitment is.\n\nA first view, that we may call \u201ccommitment as\naccountability\u201d, focuses on the sanctions that speakers\naccept to face if what they claimed turns out to be false. This\ncharacterization of assertion was first developed by Peirce:\n\n\nan act of assertion [\u2026] renders [the speaker] liable to the\npenalties of the social law (or, at any rate, those of the moral law)\nin case [the asserted proposition] should not be true, unless he has a\ndefinite and sufficient excuse. ([CP]: 2.315)\n\n\nWilliam P. Alston (2000: 55) presents the idea as follows: a speaker\naccepts responsibility for a content p being true iff the\nspeaker\n\n\nknowingly [takes] on the liability to ([lay] herself open to) blame\n(censure, reproach, being taken to task, being called to account), in\ncase of\n not-p.[33]\n\n\nThe notion of liability at play here is normative: when you\nassert that p, your audience acquires a (defeasible) right to\ncriticize you if what you say is false. On this view, to assert is\nakin to signing a contract by means of which you take responsibility\nfor something (what you said) being true, and accept to pay the\nconsequences\n otherwise.[34]\n\nTo emphasize this, some authors write that assertions\nguarantee (Peirce [CP]: 5.543; Watson 2004: 66),\nassure (Moran 2005, Hinchman 2013) or warrant\n(Carson 2006) that their content is true. However, it is not obvious\nthat what assertions guarantee is that their content is true.\nIt may be that an assertor instead accepts the responsibility for\nbeing justified in believing that one knows that the\nproposition is true (Green 2009), or that they know that the\nproposition is true.\n\nAn alternative way to characterize the responsibilities generated by\nassertions is to focus on what the speaker is expected to do,\nin virtue of making an assertion. Assertoric responsibility can be\nunderstood as a commitment to act in a certain way. When you\nmake an assertion, you generate an expectation that you will behave in\ncertain ways and not in others, especially in relation to what you\nwill say\n next.[35]\n To take a simple example, once you assert that p, it becomes\ninappropriate for you to make statements that blatantly contradict\np (Hamblin 1970b), or to behave in ways that are sharply at\nodds with accepting p as true (Geurts\n 2019).[36]\n\nFurthermore, making an assertion commits you to respond to\npeople\u2019s questions and challenges in certain ways, as the\nconversation evolves. Brandom (1994: 173\u2013175) emphasizes this,\nand argues that asserting achieves two different social results at the\nsame time: (i) it commits the speaker to defend her claim in response\nto legitimate challenges; and relatedly (ii)\nauthorizes the hearer to claim anything that follows from\nwhat the speaker asserted. MacFarlane (2003: 14\n [Other Internet References])\n summarizes (and revises) the underlying idea as follows:\n\n\nTo assert a sentence S (at a context U) is\n(inter alia) to commit oneself to providing adequate grounds\nfor the truth of S (relative to U), in response to\nany appropriate challenge, or (when appropriate) to defer this\nresponsibility to another asserter on whose testimony one is relying.\nOne can escape this commitment only by withdrawing the assertion.\n\n\nSeveral technical notions are at play here. One is the notion of\nchallenge. To challenge an assertion is to question its\nveracity (or, at least, the speaker\u2019s entitlement to make the\nassertion). An interlocutor can challenge an assertion by means of\nquestions, such as (Q),  or explicit denials, like (D):\n\n(Q)\nHow do you know that?\n(D)\nThat\u2019s not true!\n\n\nChallenges like (Q) and (D) \n are usually appropriate, but not always. For instance, they may be\ninappropriate if in the conversaation it is already settled that what\nthe speaker said is\n true.[37]\n Asserting only commits you to respond to appropriate\nchallenges \u2013 or else retract your assertion (on norms of\nretraction, see\n section 5.1.4.)\n\nIt is often argued that there is a whole family of speech acts\n(\u201cassertives\u201d or \u201crepresentatives\u201d) that\n\u201ccommit the speaker (to varying degrees) to something\u2019s\nbeing the case\u201d (Searle 1979: 12): illocutionary acts such as\nwarning, denying, reminding, arguing, deducing, and so forth.\nThese speech acts differ in the strength of the commitments they\ngenerate (e.g., swearing that p involves a stronger\ncommitment than plain assertion), and in the conditions required for\ntheir felicitous performance (e.g., warning about p is only\nappropriate if p involves a risk or danger for the\ninterlocutor). If a speech act involves a stronger commitment than\nassertion and/or extra felicity conditions, we can say that it is\n\u201cstronger\u201d than assertion. Searle and Vanderveken (1985)\nnote that whenever you perform the stronger speech act, you have also\nmade an assertion. For example, it would not be incorrect to report\n (34)\n or\n (35)\n by saying that the speaker has claimed, asserted,\nor affirmed that she is a certified forklift operator:\n\n(34)\nI swear that I am a certified forklift operator.\n(35)\nI warn you that I am a certified forklift operator.\n\n\nIf this is right, the term \u201cassertion\u201d does not designate\na single illocutionary act, but rather a class of them: it denotes\nevery speech act that is normatively stronger than (or equal to)\nassertion. This seems to lose track of a narrower meaning of the term\n\u201cassertion\u201d, one that sets plain assertions apart from\nstronger assertives. A strategy to rescue this narrow meaning while\nacknowledging assertion\u2019s close ties with other assertives is\nfound in Green (2013, 2017, 2020b: 8). Green, (like Brandom)\nunderstands commitment as a responsibility to defend your claim, and\nargues that an assertion commits you to a greater justificatory burden\nthan weaker assertives, and lesser than stronger assertives (for an\nalternative, like-minded solution, Marsili 2015: 123\u2013127).\nLabinaz (2018) outlines some difficulties for extending the Brandomian\nframework to assertive speech acts, and proposes to adopt an\nalternative approach to degrees of commitment that rather owes to the\nwork of Austin (cf. also Labinaz & Sbis\u00e0 2014:\n\u00a73).\n\nWe have seen that assertions differ from other speech acts in terms of\nthe commitments that they engender. It has also been noted that\nassertions themselves can differ in terms of the commitments that they\ngenerate: not all assertions generate commitment of the same\nstrength.\n\nUsing expressions like \u201cI think that A is\nB\u201d, \u201cProbably/Perhaps A is\nB\u201d, or \u201cA is quite B\u201d, a\nspeaker can mitigate their assertion that A is\nB. And using intensifiers like \u201cI know that A\nis B\u201d, \u201cSurely A is B\u201d,\nor \u201cA is absolutely B\u201d, the speaker can\nstrengthen or boost their assertion that A\nis B. These expressions modulate the degree of the\ncommitment engendered by the assertions in which they occur: they can\nbe used to undertake more or less responsibility\ntowards the content of the assertion, and more generally to modulate\nthe force and of the resulting speech\n act.[38]\n\nThe commitments generated by assertions have often been compared to\nthose generated by promises. For instance, by saying\n (36)\n to a friend, a speaker will typically commit herself to calling the\nrepair shop at 8.\n\n(36)\nI promise to call the repair at 8.\n\n\nIn a standard context, as a result of uttering\n (36),\n both the speaker and the addressee will regard the speaker as having\nincurred an obligation to the addressee.\n\nIn the literature, the standard view is that assertions and promises\ngenerate commitments of different kinds, so that they belong to\ndifferent families (e.g., Searle 1969, 1979). The relation between\nasserting and promising is discussed in detail in Watson (2004), who\nintroduces a distinction between primary and\nsecondary commitments. Assertions and promises differ in the\nprimary commitments that they generate. When you promise to\n\u03c6, your primary commitment is to (intend to)\nact so as to make \u03c6 happen. By contrast,\nwhen you assert that p, your primary commitment is to facts\nthat are independent of your actions: namely, for Watson, the\ndefensibility of p (Watson 2004: 68). Furthermore,\nboth assertions and promises also involve a secondary commitment to\nact in certain ways \u201cif one is queried or if things go\nwrong\u201d (2004: 67). The speaker\u2019s commitment to defend the\nassertion if challenged is on this view a secondary commitment, that\nfollows from the primary one (2004: 70).\n\nSome authors maintain a stronger connection between promising and\nasserting. Marsili (2016) argues that promising that you will\n\u03c6 \u201cillocutionary entails\u201d\nasserting that you will \u03c6. The idea is that\npromises behave like the \u201cstrong assertives\u201d discussed\nabove (swearing, confessing, guaranteeing, etc.), whose performance\ncommits the speaker to having made an assertion. For instance, if Pepa\nutters\n (36),\n it would be appropriate to say that Pepa has asserted,\naffirmed or claimed that she will call the repair shop.\nAnd if Pepa does not believe that she will call the repair shop, it\nwould be appropriate to say that Pepa has lied. In this sense,\npromising that you will do something entails asserting that you will\ndo\n it.[39]\n\nHawley (2019) also draws a strong connection between asserting and\npromises, but in the opposite direction: she analyses assertion in\nterms of promising (cf. also Carson 2006). Hawley suggests that\nwhenever you make an assertion about p, you also promise to\nspeak truthfully as to whether p. This means that whenever\nyou assert, your promise to speak truthfully is simultaneously made\nand either fulfilled or broken (depending on whether you are speaking\ntruthfully or not). However, this view has trouble explaining an\nimportant difference between asserting and promising: assertions can\nbe mitigated (\u201cMaybe I will do it\u201d is perfectly fine) but\npromises cannot (\u201cI promise that maybe I will do it\u201d is\nnot a genuine promise).\n\nCommitment-making is central to some \u201cmixed\u201d accounts of\nassertion\u2014that is, accounts that incorporate insights from\ndifferent theories of assertion. For Peirce, commitment is central to\nassertion, but not alone in characterizing it. In his view, asserting\nalso involves belief-expression: it \u201cconsists in the furnishing\nof evidence by the speaker to the hearer that the speaker believes\nsomething\u201d (Peirce [CP]: 2.335). Furthermore, for Peirce\nassertion is necessarily accompanied by an intention to convince the\nhearer: \u201cevery assertion involves an effort to make the intended\ninterpreter believe what is asserted\u201d (Peirce [CP]: 5.547). In\nshort, Peirce\u2019s view is that in asserting that p, you\nattempt to convince your audience that p is true by providing\nthem with evidence that you believe that p, thereby becoming\ncommitted to (i.e., accountable for) the truth of\n p.[40]\n\nAnother mixed account is defended by Searle (1969) (cf. also Searle\n1975b: 322 and Searle & Vanderveken 1985). Searle\u2019s\ncharacterization of assertion varies slightly throughout his writings,\nbut the central idea is that assertion can be identified on the basis\nof its distinctive rules\u2014the rules for uttering an assertion\n\u201csuccessfully\u201d and \u201cnon-defectively\u201d (i.e.,\nfelicitously). They are presented as rules for the use of\nforce-indicating devices (Searle 1969: 62\u20134). The rules can be\nsummarized as follows. Here S is the speaker and H\nthe hearer:\n\n(Searle)\n\n\n1.\nThe propositional content rule: what is to be expressed is any\nproposition p\n2.\nFirst preparatory rule: S has evidence (reasons etc.) for\nthe truth of p.\n3.\nSecond preparatory rule: It is not obvious to both S and\nH that H knows (does not need to be reminded of,\netc.) p.\n4.\nSincerity rule: S believes p.\n5.\nConstitutive rule: Counts as an undertaking to the effect that\np represents an actual state of affairs.\n \n\n\nThe fifth rule is the crucial one, and is held to be\nconstitutive of assertion. Searle contrasts constitutive\nrules with regulative\n rules.[41]\n Constitutive rules, according to Searle, are like definitions: they\ndefine what it is to engage in a certain activity: for instance,\n\u201cattacking the king in such a way that no move will leave it\nunattacked counts as checkmate\u201d (Searle 1969: 33).\n\nSearle seems to adopt a notion of \u201ccommitment\u201d that\ninvolves both a responsibility to respond to challenges (\u00e0 la\nBrandom) and a liability to sanctions (\u00e0 la Peirce): the\nassertor is expected to \u201cbe able to provide reasons for the\noriginal statement [\u2026] and can be held publicly responsible if\nit turns out to be false\u201d (Searle 2010: 82). Like Peirce, also\nSearle (1969: 65) integrates commitment with belief-expression: the\nspeaker expresses the state required by the sincerity rule, i.e., in\nthe case of assertion, whose sincerity rule is (4), the speaker\nexpresses a belief. Finally, the speaker implies that the preparatory\nconditions are met\u2014so that Searle\u2019s view has the odd\nconsequence that in asserting p, you imply that p is\nnot obviously true.\n\nA third \u201cmixed\u201d account is defended by Green (1999, 2000,\n2007, 2013, 2017, 2020a). Green distinguishes three different\nnormative notions in terms of which assertions (and other assertive\nspeech acts) can be characterized:\n\nFidelity\nLiability\nFrankness\n\n\nThe first component, fidelity, tracks commitment: one\u2019s\nresponsibility to respond to legitimate challenges. More specifically,\nfor Green, being assertorically committed to p means\nbeing responsible to provide \u201cstrong justification if\nchallenged\u201d (2017). Here \u201cstrong\u201d is used in\ncontrast to weaker assertives, like conjectures, for performing which\nis sufficient to be able to provide some (non-conclusive)\njustification if challenged.\n\nThe second component is liability to error:\n\n\none who asserts that P is liable to be right or wrong on the\nissue of P\u2019s truth exactly as P turns out to\nbe true or false. (2020a: 350)\n\n\nThis is a feature that assertion has in common with weaker assertives:\nalso in guessing or hypothesizing that p, you may be right or\nwrong depending on whether p is actually true. This relates\nto Dummett\u2019s idea that \u201can assertion is a kind of gamble\nthat the speaker will not be proved wrong\u201d (1976: 84).\n\nThe third component, frankness, has to do with sincerity:\n\u201cassertion is sincere just in case the speaker believes the\ncontent she has asserted\u201d (Green 2020a: 350). This requirement\nsets assertion aside from other assertives (such as educated guesses\nand conjectures) that do not require belief for sincere performance\n(but rather, e.g., some reasons to think the content true).\n\nA full account of assertion has to provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions for asserting. But is commitment to\nwhat you say sufficient for asserting? That is, if you say that\np and thereby also commit to the truth of p, does it\nfollow that you have asserted that p? Pagin (2004) offers a\nnegative response. The reason is that one can construct an utterance\ntype that isn\u2019t assertoric, but that would be assertoric\naccording to envisaged sufficiency view. A simple example is given\nby\n\n(37)\nI hereby commit myself to the truth of the proposition that there\nare black swans.\n\n\nWhoever utters\n (37)\n felicitously incurs a commitment to the truth of the proposition that\nthere are black swans. However, intuitively\n (37)\n would not be an assertion that there are black swans; at most, it is\na declaration of the speaker\u2019s intent to be committed to that\nproposition. What is said here does not entail that there are black\nswans (it may be accurate even if there are no black swans). If this\nis right, then incurring a commitment is not sufficient for asserting.\nThis objection puts pressure on any \u201chearer-directed\u201d\naccount, including all the ones discussed in section 4, because\nparallel constructions can be derived from any hearer-directed view;\nfor instance (against belief-expression views) by letting the speaker\ndeclare that she is representing herself as believing a given\nproposition.\n\nSome authors have questioned whether this test really undermines\ncommitment accounts of assertion (and social accounts more\ngenerally). Pegan (2009) argues that the counterexamples can be\nblocked by carefully amending the theory; see Pagin (2009) for a\nresponse. MacFarlane (2011) and Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (2013)\nsuggest that if we distinguish between what is said\nand what is asserted, we can\nregard (37) as an assertion that all swans are\nblack. Marsili & Green (2021) argue that this sort of test is\nunreliable, questioning some key assumptions needed for\n(37) to work as a\ncounterexample. They acknowledge, nonetheless, that assertions are not\nfully reducible to their social effects.\n",
