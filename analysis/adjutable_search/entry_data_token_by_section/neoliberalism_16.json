And\nin some respects, the neoliberals were libertarian under some\nconditions. Indeed, Buchanan thought anarchy was the morally best\nregime, even if it was infeasible in practice. But it is still common\nfor libertarians to criticize more moderate libertarians for allowing\nany redistribution of wealth, such as Murray Rothbard (1973, 1982\n[2002]), Robert Nozick (1974), or for prioritizing democracy over more\nepistocratic or elite-leaning forms of political decision-making, such\nas Jason Brennan (2016).\n",
