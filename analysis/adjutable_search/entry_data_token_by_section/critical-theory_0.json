    "main_text": "The Frankfurt School: Origins, Influences, and Development\n1. The Frankfurt School: Origins, Influences, and Development\n\nThe \u201cFrankfurt School\u201d of critical theory is not really a\nschool at all. It is a loosely held together tradition constituted by\nongoing debates among adherents about how best to define and develop\nthat tradition. This includes disagreements about methods, about how\nto interpret earlier figures and texts in the tradition, about whether\npast shifts in focus were advances or dead ends, and about how to\nrespond to new challenges arising from other schools of thought and\ncurrent social developments. This section tells a largely\nchronological story, focusing on the origins, influences, and key\ntexts of the Frankfurt School, and concludes with reference to ongoing\ndebates on how to inherit and continue the tradition.\n",
