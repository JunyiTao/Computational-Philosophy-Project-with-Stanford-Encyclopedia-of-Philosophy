    "main_text": "Premise Semantics || Motivations\n4.1 Motivations\n\nSome early theories of conditionals said that a counterfactual is\ntrue, or assertable, if and only if its antecedent, together with\nfurther \u201cco-tenable\u201d premises, implies its consequent\n(Ramsey 1931 commenting on Mill; Chisholm 1946; Goodman 1947, 1955;\nMackie 1962). D. Lewis called such theories metalinguistic, the idea\nbeing that \u201cif \\(A\\), \\(C\\)\u201d is true provided there is an\nargument leading from the sentence \\(A\\) and additional premises to\n\\(C\\). On these accounts, the counterfactual is either a sentence\nmeaning that some suitable argument backing it exists, or\u2014as in\nMackie\u2019s version\u2014it is itself an elliptical presentation\nof such an argument. The principal problem of any such theory is to\nspecify which \u201cadditional premises\u201d are suitable to be\nconjoined to a given antecedent and which are not. Goodman (1955)\nviews the additional premises as general laws, supplemented by\nrelevant factual conditions, but the problem is to determine which\nfacts are to be assumed, and which facts are to be retracted. Rescher\n(1964) treats additional potential premises as ordered according to\ntheir position in a system of \u201cmodal categories\u201d.\n\nAn account of the co-tenability idea based on possible worlds was\nfurther elaborated in the work of Veltman (1976) and Kratzer (1979),\nin what has come to be known as premise semantics (an\nexpression coined by D. Lewis 1981). Premise semantics can be\npresented either as providing acceptance conditions or as providing\ntruth conditions. It is compatible with an epistemic as well as with\nan ontic interpretation of conditionals. The former builds on the idea\nthat the premises represent essentially an agent\u2019s basic\nbeliefs; this is the approach of Veltman (1976) who took inspiration\nfrom Ramsey. The latter takes the premises to represent the basic\nfacts of a possible world; this is the approach of Kratzer (1979,\n1981), who was inspired by Rescher and Lewis (D. Lewis 1981) and has\nfunctions assigning a premise set to every possible world. In any\ncase, the idea of premise semantics is this. Relative to a given set\n\\(\\Gamma\\) of premises (assigned to a possible world \\(w\\)), a\nconditional \\(A>B\\) is accepted (or true at \\(w\\)) if and only if\nfor every maximal subset of \\(\\Gamma'\\) of \\(\\Gamma\\) that is\nconsistent with \\(A\\) it holds that \\(\\Gamma' \\cup \\{A\\}\\) implies\n\\(B\\).\n",
