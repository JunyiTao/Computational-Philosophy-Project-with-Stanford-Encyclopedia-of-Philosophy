For Butler, even though the self is\nthe mere effect of repeated gender performances, it is nonetheless\nreal: There are selves, they are socially constructed. What is strictly\nfictional, for Butler, is the view that they are unified cores which\nexist prior to gendered behavior. Butler does not want to deny\nthe existence of our psychic lives.\n\n\nFor Butler, gender performance is citational in that it\ntacitly cites or draws on gender norms (1993, 12\u20133;\n230\u201333). But it is precisely this citing of the norm as\nauthoritative which confers authority upon the norm (1993,\n13). Indeed, the agent herself as the one who either willfully\ncomplies or fails to comply with the authoritative norm is likewise\nproduced through this process of citation (1993, 13, 225, 232). Thus,\nButler sees the agent qua unified source of gendered behavior as\nperformatively constituted through repeated acts of gendered\nbehavior. This is to say: The \u2018agent\u2019 is, far from the\ncause of gendered performance, its effect (1990, 184\u20135; 1991,\n24; 1993, 232).\n\n\nSuch a view yields a kind of paradox: If the agent is the mere effect\nof the repeated acts, then how are the acts themselves produced?  The\nconcerns may be mitigated to some extent by recognizing that Butler is\ninterested in the very formation of self-identity as understood within\na psychoanalytic tradition. She follows Freud in seeing the ego as\nformed largely through a process of complex identifications.\nIdentification, in this context, is to be understood as the stable\npsychic \u201ctaking on\u201d of perceived properties of a lost love\nobject (1990, 73\u201384; 1991 26\u20137). In this way, the lost\nobject becomes a part of the ego through a process of imitation: The\nobject is internalized (and psychically \u201cpreserved\u201d).\n\n\nIn Butler's view, the taboo against (heterosexual) incest presupposes\na prior taboo against homosexuality (which effectively constitutes\nheterosexual desire as such) (1990, 82). Yet the taboo requires that\nthe loved object as well as the homosexual desire itself be given\nup. In a process of melancholy the lost object is not grieved because\nthe desire cannot even be acknowledge in the first place. So the lost\nobject is internalized through this process of identification by which\nthe individual now psychically takes on the attributes of the lost\nobject, thereby acquiring a heterosexual gender identity (1990,\n78\u201381; 1991, 26\u20137). In this way, imitation lies at the\nroot of the very formation of gender identity.\n\n\nFor Butler the term psyche applies to more than simply the\nself or ego as constituted through gender imitation. In addition to the\nconscious self, she is also interested in the psychic workings of the\nunconscious as postulated in psychoanalysis. In Butler's view,\nthe psyche outstrips the performatively constituted agent insofar as\nthe repeated acts fail to entirely imitate the preceding ones and,\nindeed, insofar as they must be repeated at all (1991, 24). Butler\nallows for \u201cpsychic excess\u201d which applies to that which is\nboth presupposed by and yet excluded by heterosexual gender identities.\nFor example, the love of the lost object discussed above cannot be\nallowed into the heterosexual gender identity. Nonetheless it is part\nof the psyche\u2014is \u201cpsychic excess\u201d\u2014insofar as it is\nessentially presupposed by and yet disowned in the formation of\nheterosexual gender identity. Such excess manifests itself, for Butler,\nin performative failures and in behaviors which expose the imitative\ncharacter of gender (24\u20135).\n\n\nThis involves a notable departure from the \u201cdouble\nconsciousness\u201d model of resistance (and identity) discussed\nabove. Rather than flagging the simultaneous blending of conflicting\ncultural claims to form a subject position that is constituted by its\nborderland status, Butler deploys the notion of \u201cpsychic\nexcess\u201d and points to the re-significations of performance (as\nwithin a historical chain) in ways that subvert a stable\nsubject position altogether. This means that Butler situates subversion\nin disruptions which fail to imitate in the same way, which expose and\nundermine the illusion of a stable self. Despite this difference,\nhowever, both the notion of \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d and\nButler's theory of gender performativity similarly depart from\nRaymond's view which postulates a self at least ideally freed\nfrom oppressive machinations.\n\n\nIn light of her appeal to citationality, Butler further clarifies that\nthe subversive potential of gender performance is significantly\nconstrained since, in order for gender performance to be subversive,\nit still must cite existing gender norms as norms (1993, 122\u20134,\n226\u20137).  This means that gender subversion is limited by the\nhistory of past iterations of gender performance. Butler also allows\nthat there are ways in which gender performance can both replicate and\nsubvert sexist, racist, and heterosexist norms at once. For example,\nshe aims to defend an ambivalent picture of the culture portrayed in\nJennie Livington's 1991 film Paris is Burning which documents\nthe drag ball competitions of various \u2018houses\u2019 in New York\nCity, held by mostly black and latino/a queer men, transsexuals, and\nqueens (1993, 121\u2013140).\n\n\nButler's discussion of the film is especially notable for its\nexplicit treatment of transsexuality. She is largely responding to bell\nhooks who criticizes the film for the invisibility of the subject\nposition of the director (a white, Yale-educated, lesbian woman) in\nshaping an objectifying spectacle of non-white gender and sexuality\n(1992, 150\u20131) and the very behavior and attitudes of the individuals\ndocumented in the film (147\u201350). Following in the tradition of Raymond,\nhooks raises worries about the masculinity involved in the drag\nperformances (citing the competitive edge involved in the balls as well\nas the celebration of sexual objectification) (148\u20139). Moreover, she\npoints out that white femininity seems elevated in these balls as the\ncanonical form of femininity (150). Butler, by contrast, aims to\nhighlight both subversion and the ways in which such subversion is\nconstrained and even erased through dominant heterosexist forms of\ngender.\n\n\nThe bulk of Butler's defense of this ambivalence derives from\nher discussion of the life and death of Venus Xtravaganza, a light\nskinned Latina, and self-identified pre-operative transsexual woman.\nXtravaganza dreams of a happy, suburban, heterosexual life but works as\na prostitute and is ultimately killed. On the one hand, Butler sees the\nmurder as the effect of the dominant order to annihilate that which\nsubverts its (in this case, Xtravaganza's\n\u201cin-between\u201d body and gender incongruence) (1993, 131). On\nthe other hand, Butler sees the murder of Xtravaganza as flowing from\nher \u201ctragic misreading of the social map of power\u201d where\nher hopes to live a happy life in the suburbs are shattered when she is\ntreated in the way in which women of color are treated (1993, 131).\nWhile Butler sees Xtravaganza's life is genuinely subversive of\ndominant regulations of gender, she also raises worries about the\nnature of Xtravaganza's desire for gender realness as a\nmiddle-class, heterosexual woman (133) . In Butler's view, this\ndesire is primarily an attempt to transcend race and class through\ngender transformation (130).\n",
