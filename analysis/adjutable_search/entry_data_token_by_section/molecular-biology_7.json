    "main_text": "Concepts in Molecular Biology || Information\n2.2 Information\n\nThe language of information appears often in molecular biology. Genes\nas linear DNA sequences of bases are said to carry\n\u201cinformation\u201d for the production of proteins. During\nprotein synthesis, the information is \u201ctranscribed\u201d from\nDNA to messenger RNA and then \u201ctranslated\u201d from RNA to\nprotein. With respect to inheritance, it is often said that what is\npassed from one generation to the next is the\n\u201cinformation\u201d in the genes, namely the linear ordering of\nbases along complementary DNA strands. Historians of biology have\ntracked the entrenchment of information-talk in molecular biology (Kay\n2000) since its introduction.\n\nThe question for philosophers of biology is whether an analysis of the\nconcept of information can capture the various ways in which the\nconcept is used in molecular biology (e.g., Maynard Smith 2000). The\nusage of \u201cinformation\u201d in the mathematical theory of\ncommunication is too impoverished to capture the molecular biological\nusage, since the coded sequences in the DNA are more than just a\nsignal with some number of bits that may or may not be accurately\ntransmitted (Sarkar 1996b,c; Sterelny and Griffiths 1999; Shannon and\nWeaver 1949). Conversely, the usage in cognitive neuroscience, with\nits talk of \u201crepresentations\u201d (e.g., Crick 1988) may be\nsaid to be too rich, since the coded sequences in the DNA are also not\nsaid to have within them a representation of the structure of the\nprotein (Darden 2006b). No definition of \u201cinformation\u201d as\nit is used in molecular biology has yet received wide support among\nphilosophers of biology.\n\nStephen Downes (2006) helpfully distinguishes three positions on the\nrelation between information and the natural world:\n\nInformation is present in DNA and other nucleotide sequences.\nOther cellular mechanisms contain no information.\nInformation is present in DNA, in other nucleotide sequences and\nother cellular mechanisms, for example cytoplasmic or extra-cellular\nproteins; and in many other media, for example, the embryonic\nenvironment or components of an organism\u2019s wider\nenvironment.\nDNA and other nucleotide sequences do not contain information, nor\ndo any other cellular mechanisms.\n\n\nThese options may be read either ontologically or heuristically. A\nheuristic reading of (1), for instance, views the talk of information\nin molecular biology as useful in providing a way of talking and in\nguiding research. And so the heuristic benefit of the information\nconcept can be defended without making any commitment to the\nontological status (Sarkar 2000). Indeed, one might argue that a vague\nand open-ended use of information is valuable for heuristic purposes,\nespecially during early discovery phases in the development of a\nfield.\n\nPhilosophers\u2019 discussions of the concept of information in\nbiology have also focused on its ontological reading. Three different\nphilosophical accounts of information serve as exemplars of\nDownes\u2019 three categories. Ulrich Stegmann (2005) provides an\nexample of Downes\u2019 first category with his analysis of\ntemplate-directed synthesis. (Stegmann does explicitly allow that\ncomponents other than nucleotide sequences might contain what he calls\ninstructional information. However, his only example is a thought\nexperiment involving enzymes linearly ordered along a membrane;\nnothing of the sort is known to actually exist or even seems very\nlikely to exist.) Stegmann calls this the sequentialization view.\nStegmann\u2019s instructional account of genetic information requires\nthat the component carrying the information satisfy the following\nconditions: an advance specification of the kind and order of steps\nthat yield a determinate outcome if the steps are carried out. On his\naccount, DNA qualifies as an instructional information carrier for\nreplication, transcription and translation. The sequence of bases\nprovides the order. The hydrogen bonding between specific bases and\nthe genetic code provide the specific kinds of steps. And the\nmechanisms of replication, transcription, and translation yield\ncertain outcomes: a copy of the DNA double helix, an mRNA, and a\nlinear order of amino acids. Also, because DNA carries information for\na specific outcome, an error can occur as the mechanism operates to\nproduce that outcome; hence Stegmann\u2019s account allows for errors\nand error-correcting mechanisms (such as proof reading mechanisms that\ncorrect DNA mutations). For more on this topic, see the entry on\n biological information.\n\nEva Jablonka (2002) is an example of Downes\u2019 second category.\nShe argues that information is ubiquitous. She defines information as\nfollows: a source becomes an informational input when an interpreting\nreceiver can react to the form of the source (and variations in this\nform) in a functional manner. She claims a broad applicability of this\ndefinition. The definition, she says, accommodates information\nstemming from environmental cues as well as from evolved signals, and\ncalls for a comparison between information-transmission in different\ntypes of inheritance systems \u2014 the genetic, the epigenetic, the\nbehavioral, and the cultural-symbolic. On this view, genes have no\ntheoretically privileged informational status (Jablonka 2002:\n583).\n\nIn line with Downes\u2019 third category, C. Kenneth Waters argues\nthat information is a useful term in rhetorical contexts, such as\nseeking funding for DNA sequencing by claiming that DNA carries\ninformation. However, from an ontological perspective, Waters claims\nthat explication of DNA\u2019s causal role has no need for the\nconcept of information. Genes, he argues, should not be viewed as\n\u201cimmaterial units of information\u201d (Waters 2000: 541). As\ndiscussed in\n Section 2.3\n below, Waters\u2019 focus is on stretches of DNA whose causal roles\nare as actual specific difference makers in genetic mechanisms (Waters\n2007). Talk of information is not needed; causal role function talk is\nsufficient. (For more on Waters\u2019 view see his entry on\n molecular genetics;\n for others who make similar points, see Sustar 2007; Weber 2005,\n2006.)\n",
