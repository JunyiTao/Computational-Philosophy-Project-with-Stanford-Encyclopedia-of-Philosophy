    "main_text": "Causal Modeling || Identification Problems\n3.2 Identification Problems\n\nWe will be interested in a variety of problems that have a general\nstructure. There will be a query concerning some causal\nfeature of the system being investigated. A query may concern:\n\n The qualitative causal structure on a set of variables. For\ninstance, we may ask which DAG, or which ADMG, correctly describes the\ncausal structure among the variables in \\(\\bV = \\{S, T, W, X, Y,\nZ\\}\\). Or we may be interested in some specific feature of the causal\nstructure, such as whether X is a direct cause of Y.\nProblems with this type of query are sometimes called causal\ndiscovery problems.\n The effects of interventions. If we were to intervene in\nthe causal structure and set the value of X to x, what\nis the probability that Y would take the value y? For\ninstance, if we were to intervene by giving drugs to a patient, what\nis the probability that he would recover?\n\n\nA given problem will also have a set of inputs. These fall into a\nvariety of categories:\n\n Metaphysical and methodological assumptions: These are general\nassumptions about the relationship between causal structure and\nprobability. These assumptions function like a probabilistic theory of\ncausation. They tell us, in particular, how causal relationships\nconstrain probabilistic relationships. The main assumptions that we\nwill consider are the Markov Condition (MC), the\nMinimality Condition, and the Faithfulness\nCondition. \n Background assumptions about the causal structure: We may assume\nthat a particular DAG or ADMG describes the causal structure on some\nset of variables, or assume that the correct graph does or does not\ninclude an arrow from X to Y. In particular, we may have\ntime order information that constrains the possible causal structures.\nFor instance, if we know that X concerns a time earlier than\nY, then we can rule out causal structures in which Y\ncausally influences X.\n Observations: Information about the probability distribution P\nover the variables in \\(\\bV\\).\n\n\nIn realistic scientific cases, we never directly observe the true\nprobability distribution P over a set of variables. Rather, we observe\nfinite data that approximate the true probability when sample sizes\nare large enough and observation protocols are well-designed. Since\nour primary concern is with the philosophical issue of how\nprobabilities determine or constrain causal structure, we will not\naddress these important practical concerns. An answer to a query that\ncan be determined from the true probabilities is said to be\nidentifiable. For instance, if we can determine the correct\nDAG on a variable set \\(\\bV\\) from the probability distribution on\n\\(\\bV\\), the DAG is identifiable.\n",
