    "main_text": "Occasionalism\n3. Occasionalism\n\nCordemoy was one of the first, if not the first, to argue that\nCartesian metaphysics leads to occasionalism, the doctrine that God is\nthe one true cause active in the world. (Louis de La Forge\u2019s\nTrait\u00e9 de l\u2019esprit de l\u2019homme et de ses\nfacultez et fonctions, et de son union avec le corps (Treatise on the\nmind of man and its faculties and functions, and on its union with the\nbody), which also argued for occasionalism on Cartesian grounds,\nappeared just months before the Discernement, though Cordemoy\nclaims to have accepted occasionalism as early as 1658 (1968, 145). It\nis unlikely that either Cordemoy or de La Forge influenced the\nother.)\n\nCordemoy\u2019s argument for occasionalism with regard to body-body\ninteraction appears in the Fourth Discourse of the\nDiscernement (he will later expand his occasionalism to cover\nall \u2018interaction\u2019 in the created world). There we are\ngiven a series of definitions and axioms, and conclusions derived from\nthese. Cordemoy begins by asserting as axioms (1) a thing does not\nhave of itself (de soy) that which can be lost without\nceasing to be what it is, and (2) bodies are able to lose their motion\nwithout ceasing to be bodies. The conclusion drawn is that bodies do\nnot have motion of themselves (that is, they do not possess the\nproperty of motion essentially), since they continue to be bodies when\nnot in motion. Nor can one body give motion to another. This is not\nstated as one of Cordemoy\u2019s axioms, but rather follows from\nCartesian metaphysics, which holds motion to be a mode or state of a\nbody, and not a quality distinct from the body. As such, a\nmode\u2014that is, the very same mode\u2014cannot be transferred\nfrom one body to another.\n\nAs for the first mover, it could not itself be a body, since if it\nwere, it would have to have motion of itself (for as first mover,\nwhere else would it get it?), and this has been shown to be impossible\nfor bodies. Thus we may also conclude that the first mover is not a\nbody. But there being only two kinds of substances (Cordemoy\u2019s\nthird axiom), bodies and minds, only a mind remains as a candidate for\nthe first mover. Further, it is clear that our (finite) minds are not\nthe source of motion in bodies. In the first place, our minds cannot\neffect our bodies in certain ways, either because they are immune to\nsuch influence (e.g., I cannot will the cells in my liver to cease\ndividing) or because of old age or injury (e.g., a crippled man cannot\nwill himself to walk). Second\u2014and noteworthy in that it\nanticipates both Malebranche and Hume\u2014if we restrict ourselves\nto what we observe, we never experience a causal connection but only\ntemporal succession between our volitions at one moment and our\nbody\u2019s actions the next. Third, if we could produce motion in\nbodies at will, it would, says Cordemoy, upset God\u2019s plan for\nthe quantity of motion which God conserves in the world. Thus he\nconcludes that an infinite will must be the first mover.\n\nIt is Cordemoy\u2019s fourth and fifth axioms which, together with\nthis conclusion, get us occasionalism. The fourth axiom states that to\nmove is an action, and the fifth claims that an action can only be\ncontinued by the agent which initiated it. Therefore, the mind which\ninitiates the motion of bodies, God, is the same agent who continues\ntheir motion in the present. As with those who fail to distinguish\nbodies from matter, the fault of those who posit finite causes are\nguilty of making an unsupported inference from their sense experience.\nMaking a point that Malebranche and Hume would later echo, Cordemoy\nsays: \u201cWhen we say, for example, that body B drives body A away\nfrom its place, if we examine well what is acknowledged for certain in\nthis case, we will only see that body B was moved, that it encountered\nC, which was at rest, and that since this encounter, the first ceased\nto be moved [and] the second commenced to be moved. But if we\nrecognize that B gave some of its motion to C, that is truly only a\nprejudice which comes from what we do not see.\u201d In good\nCartesian spirit, Cordemoy is claiming that it is reason which points\nout the way the world must be, and that uncritical acceptance of the\ndeliverances of the senses will only lead to error.\n",
