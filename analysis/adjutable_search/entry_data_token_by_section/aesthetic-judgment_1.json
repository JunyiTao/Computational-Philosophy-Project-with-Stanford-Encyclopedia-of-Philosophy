    "main_text": "The Judgment of Taste || Subjectivity\n1.1 Subjectivity\n\nThe first necessary condition of a judgment of taste is that it is\nessentially subjective. What this means is that the judgment\nof taste is based on a feeling of pleasure or displeasure. This\ndistinguishes judgments of taste from empirical judgments. Central\nexamples of judgments of taste are judgments of beauty and ugliness.\nJudgments of taste can be about art or nature.\n\nThis subjectivist thesis would be over-strict if it were interpreted\nin an \u201catomistic\u201d fashion, so that some subjective\nresponse corresponds to every judgment of taste, and vice versa.\nSometimes one makes a judgment of taste on inductive grounds or on the\nbasis of authority. But these cases indirectly rely on judgements made\non the basis of subjective responses. A more holistic picture of the\nrelation between response and judgment would preserve the spirit of\nthe subjectivist doctrine while fitting our actual lives more\naccurately. The subjectivist doctrine needs to be refined in order to\ndeal with the cases of induction and authority. But it must not be\nabandoned. The doctrine is basically right.\n\nHowever, it is not obvious what to make of the subjectivity of the\njudgment of taste. We need an account of the nature of the pleasure on\nwhich judgments of beauty are based.\n\nBeyond a certain point, this issue cannot be pursued independently of\nmetaphysical issues about realism, for the metaphysics we favor is\nbound to affect our view of the nature of the pleasure we take in\nbeauty. In particular, we need to know whether or not pleasure in\nbeauty represents properties of beauty and ugliness that things\npossess. If not, does it involve the cognitive faculties that we\ndeploy in understanding the world, as Kant thought? Or is it not a\nmatter of the cognitive faculties, but a matter of sentimental\nreactions, which are schooled in various ways, as Hume and others\nthought? These are very hard questions. But there are some things we\ncan say about the pleasure involved in finding something beautiful\nwithout raising the temperature too high.\n\nKant makes various points about pleasure in the beautiful, which fall\nshort of what we might call his \u201cdeep\u201d account of the\nnature of pleasure in beauty, according to which it is the harmonious\nfree play of the cognitive faculties, of imagination and\nunderstanding. According to Kant\u2019s \u201csurface\u201d account\nof pleasure in beauty, it is not mere sensuous gratification, as in\nthe pleasure of sensation, or of eating and drinking. Unlike such\npleasures, pleasure in beauty is occasioned by the perceptual\nrepresentation of a thing. (In contemporary terms, we would put this\nby saying that pleasure in beauty has an intentional content.)\nMoreover, unlike other sorts of intentional pleasures, pleasure in\nbeauty is \u201cdisinterested\u201d. This means, roughly, that it is\na pleasure that does not involve desire\u2014pleasure in beauty is\ndesire-free. That is, the pleasure is neither based on desire nor does\nit produce one by itself. In this respect, pleasure in beauty is\nunlike pleasure in the agreeable, unlike pleasure in what is good for\nme, and unlike pleasure in what is morally good. According to Kant,\nall such pleasures are \u201cinterested\u201d\u2014they are bound\nup with desire. This is discussed in section 3 below. This is all\nimportant as far as it goes, but it is all negative. We need to know\nwhat pleasure in beauty is, as well as what it is\nnot. What can be said of a more positive nature?\n",
