    "main_text": "Can contractualism really avoid aggregation?\n8. Can contractualism really avoid aggregation?\n We saw earlier that, unlike utilitarianism, contractualism rejects\naggregation. However, there are some cases where\ncontractualism\u2019s aversion to aggregation seems to lead to\nundesirable results. (For a variety of contractualist responses to\naggregation, see Reibetanz 1998, Norcross 2002, Kumar 2011, Fried\n2012a. See also sections 9 and 12, as contractualists and their\nopponents often discuss aggregation alongside either demandingness or\nrisk.)\n\nConsider the following situation, drawn from a\nfamous article by John Taurek (Taurek 1977).\n\n\nThe Rocks. Six innocent swimmers have become trapped on two\nrocks by the incoming tide. Five of the swimmers are on one rock,\nwhile the last swimmer is on the second rock. Each swimmer will drown\nunless they are rescued. You are the sole life-guard on duty. You have\ntime to get to one rock in your patrol-boat and save everyone on it.\nBecause of the distance between the rocks, and the speed of the tide,\nyou cannot get to both rocks in time. What should you do?\n\n\nSuppose you decide to save the lone swimmer on the second rock.\nIntuitively, this seems wrong. Surely you should have saved five\npeople instead of one. The challenge for contractualism is to explain\nwhy what you did is wrong. Utilitarians have a straightforward answer,\nbased on aggregation. You should save the five people instead of the\none simply because five deaths is a worse result than one death. This\ncase is tricky for contractualism because it rejects aggregation. The\nfive people will each want to reject the principle that\nallows you to save the one, by appealing to the fact that such a\nprinciple leaves them to die. But the lone person on the second rock\nwill want to reject any principle that allows you to save the five.\nAnd the reason for objecting to the principle is exactly the same in\neach case\u2014this principle leaves that person to die. The\nfive people cannot appeal to the fact that there are more of\nthem\u2014because this is not an individual reason. (Suppose you are\none of the five. The fact that four other people will die is not\nsomething you can object to, as it is not something that happens to\nyou.) It therefore looks as if we have reached a stalemate\u2014and\nperhaps the best solution (the principle that no-one can reasonably\nreject) is to toss a coin. That way, each of the six people gets a\nfifty-fifty chance of survival. No-one can reasonably reject\nthis principle on the grounds that it only gives\nthem a fifty-fifty chance of survival, because any alternative gives\nsomeone even less chance. Tossing a coin is the only principle that\nguarantees everyone at least a fifty-fifty chance. So it is\nthe only principle that no-one can reasonably reject.\n\nOne contractualist response is to bite the bullet, and accept that\ncoin tossing is the right answer. Many contractualists, however, wish\nto capture the intuition that you ought to save the five. Recall that\nan agent\u2019s reason for rejecting a principle can be based, not on\nits effect on her well-being, but on what that principle says about\nher or how it treats her. Imagine one of the five swimmers on the\nfirst rock arguing as follows: \u201cCoin tossing is clearly the\nright principle if there is one person on each rock, as it balances\ntheir competing reasons. If you apply the same principle when there\nare five on this rock, you are saying it makes no difference that\nthere are five rather than one. So you are acting exactly as if I\nwasn\u2019t here, facing this life and death situation. A principle\nthat allows you\u2014in effect\u2014to ignore my plight in this way\ndoesn\u2019t show respect for me. If there were one person on each\nrock, their claims to be rescued would cancel out. So we then look to\nsee whether there are other people on either rock. There are several\nsuch people, and I am one of them. My claim to be rescued remains\nun-trumped. So you should rescue the five.\u201d (For a critique of\nthis argument, see Otsuka 2001.)\n\nA further difficult kind of case for contractualism is where the\nburdens that different persons stand to suffer are unequal\u2014and\nso cannot balance each other and cancel each other out\u2014but are\nstill very severe in each case. The following example is suggested by\nDerek Parfit\u2019s discussion of contractualism and aggregation\n(Parfit 2003). Consider a choice between two scenarios. In the first,\none person suffers agony for a hundred years; while in the second a\nmillion people suffer agony for a hundred years minus a day. An\nadditional day of agony is a considerable burden. Therefore if we\nconsider the situation from the perspective of the single individuals\ninvolved, it would seem that the first person\u2019s complaint\n(\u2018I will suffer for a hundred years\u2019) outweighs the\ncomplaint of any other single individual (\u2018I will suffer for a\nhundred years minus a day\u2019). However, a utilitarian would argue\nthat, in this case, the second scenario is worse.\n\nA utilitarian might conclude that, while this ideal of choosing a\nscenario that is acceptable to each person from his or her personal\npoint of view is extremely appealing, it is not always attainable. In\nparticular, this ideal is not practical when we cannot avoid placing a\nsevere burden on at least one person. Contractualism focuses each\nperson\u2019s mind on the burdens imposed on himself or herself, and\non other individuals\u2014and invites us to withdraw our burdens if\nwe see other individuals suffering much more under a competing\nprinciple. However, in our present example, each of the individuals in\nthe second scenario would find the situation unacceptable from their\npersonal point of view, simply because of the magnitude of the\nsuffering it involves. It is not plausible that they would withdraw\ntheir complaint because the person in the first scenario stands to\nsuffer a slightly greater burden. It can be argued that in such cases\nwe should give intrinsic moral weight to the number of persons who\nsuffer a severe burden and so minimise the number of persons for whom\nthe situation is unacceptable.\n\nThe contractualist has several possible replies. They could simply\ndeny the utilitarian\u2019s intuition. Perhaps it is wrong to impose\na greater burden on a single person, even to save many others from a\nslightly worse burden. Contractualists who want to capture the\nutilitarian\u2019s intuition might argue that, just as complaints are\nnot always tied to well-being, the strength of an individual\u2019s\ncomplaint need not be proportional to the loss of well-being. Perhaps\na principle that allows me to suffer for a century minus a day is just\nas objectionable to me as one that allows me to suffer for a century.\nOnce the complaints are on a par, we can then appeal to our earlier\ntie-breaking method, and conclude that it is wrong to favour the one\nover the many. (A utilitarian will reply that in any context a day of\nagony is an enormous moral burden\u2014it is no less bad if the\nperson has already suffered for almost a century\u2014so that the\ncomplaint of the individual in the first scenario has to be seen as\nsignificantly greater than that of any individual in the second\nscenario.)\n\nIn chapter 21 of On What Matters, Parfit presents further\narguments that can be deployed against the individualist\nrestriction\u2014which limits the grounds for rejecting a principle\nto its implications for single people. First, Parfit presents\na series of cases where, he argues, \u201cany contractualism that\nincorporates the individualist restriction must conflict with all\nplausible views about the distribution of benefits and burdens\u201d\n(Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 198). One representative case is the\nfollowing (Parfit 2011, volume 2, pp. 199\u2013200):\n\nCase Six: The only possible alternatives are these:\n\n\n\n\nBlue will live to the age\nof:\nEach of some number of\nother people will live to: \n\nWe do nothing\n30\n30 \n\nWe do A\n70\n30 \n\nWe do B\n35\n35 \n\n\n\nFollowing Parfit, utilitarians will object that, if we endorse the\nindividualist restriction, then \u201cwe ought to give Blue her 40\nmore years of life rather than giving 5 more years to Blue and to as\nmany as a million of these other people. \u2026 this is\nclearly false\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 200).\n\nSecond, Parfit offers a new argument that, when the individualist\nrestriction does enable the contractualist to reach the right\nconclusions, it cannot do so for the right reasons. Consider the\nfollowing case (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 196):\n\nCase Three: The only possible alternatives are these:\n\n\n\n\nFuture days of pain \n\n\nfor Blue:\nfor each of some number of\nother people: \n\nWe do nothing\n100\n10 \n\nWe treat Blue\n0\n10 \n\nWe treat the others\n100\n0 \n\n\n\nHere, the utilitarian says that, if the number of other people exceeds\nten, then we should treat the others, as this maximises total\nwell-being. Parfit argues that \u201cmost of us would reject this\nutilitarian claim, believing instead that we ought to save Blue from\nher great ordeal. We might even believe that we ought to save Blue\nfrom her 100 days of pain rather than saving any number of\nsuch other people from their much smaller burden of 10 days of\npain\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 2, pp. 196\u20137).\n\nThe individualist restriction enables contractualism to diverge from\nutilitarianism in this case. Because the other people\u2019s reasons\ncannot be aggregated, they cannot ever outweigh Blue\u2019s reason.\nBut opponents of the individualist restriction will object that this\nis a coincidence. The real reason we should treat Blue is not because\nBlue\u2019s burden would otherwise be greater, but because Blue would\notherwise be so much worse-off. For instance, suppose instead that, if\nwe do nothing, everyone (Blue included) will suffer 100 days of pain\n[This is Parfit\u2019s Case Four]. We must now choose\nbetween relieving Blue of all of her 100 days, or relieving\neveryone (Blue included) of 10 of their 100 days of pain. Those who\nfavour a more impersonal formulation of contractualism will object\nthat the individualist restriction must instruct us to do the former.\n\u201cAnd [this conclusion] is clearly false\u201d (Parfit 2011,\nvolume 2, p. 202).\n\nIn Cases Four and Six, opponents of the individualist restriction will\nargue that we can only get the right result by allowing the other\npeople to pool their individual complaints\u2014otherwise, they\ncannot hope to overrule Blue. Those who find this intuition compelling\nmay conclude that contractualists must drop the individualist\nrestriction, and instead accommodate Case Three by saying that\n\u201cpeople have stronger moral claims, and stronger grounds to\nreject some principle, the worse off these people are\u201d (Parfit\n2011, volume 2, p. 202). Other contractualists may be prepared to bite\nthe bullet here, or to seek alternative ways to accommodate these\nintuitions, on the grounds that the individualist restriction is an\nessential feature of contractualism, without which contractualism\ncannot hope to escape the extreme and alienating demands of\nutilitarianism\u2014the topic of the next section.\n",
