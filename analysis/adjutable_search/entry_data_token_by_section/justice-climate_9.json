    "main_text": "Responsibilities || The Burden-Sharing Question\n5.2 The Burden-Sharing Question\n\nThree principles, in particular, have emerged.\n5.2.1 The Polluter Pays Principle\n\nOne principle commonly referred to as the Polluter Pays Principle holds that\nburdens should be borne in proportion to how much an agent has emitted\n(Shue 2014: 182\u2013186). This is an intuitively plausible approach. It\nreflects a widely held principle about responsibility, namely\nthat we can, subject to certain conditions, hold agents responsible\nfor their actions.\n\nThis noted, there are several complications. First, some argue that it\nis unfair to hold agents responsible for the harms resulting from\ntheir emission of greenhouse gases if they were excusably ignorant of\nthe impact of their actions. They then argue that many of those who\nhave emitted greenhouse gases in the past were excusably ignorant and\nso cannot be held liable.\n\nSeveral replies have been given to this line of argument.\nFirst, on an empirical note, we can respond that for several decades\nnow people could not plausibly claim to be excusably ignorant about\nthe effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Of course, specifying\nprecisely when one could no longer claim to be excusably ignorant will\nbe hard, but the salient point is that there are limits to the extent\nto which one can plead excusable ignorance (Singer 2002:\n 34).[4]\n Second, some argue that it can be fair to ascribe burdens to those\nwho were excusably ignorant of the harms of their emissions if those\nwho emitted benefited sufficiently from the emissions. The rough\nthought here is that while someone might reasonably complain that it\nis unfair to penalise them for non-culpably contributing to harm,\ntheir case is considerably weakened if it is also the case that the\nharmful activity also created benefits for them. If they have\nbenefited then making them pay would not be so onerous and might even\nleave them no worse off than if they had they not emitted. (For\ndiscussion of the \u201cexcusable ignorance\u201d objection and\nresponses to it see Gosseries [2004: 39\u201341].)\n\nA second challenge draws attention to the fact that many emitters are\nno longer alive. Why, the objection goes, should those alive now foot\nthe bill for the acts of previous generations? Again responses have\nbeen forthcoming. Some may adopt a collectivist approach and hold that\nthe relevant agents are collective bodies like states, and so they\nhold that since country X emitted in the past country X\nshould pay now. Some, by contrast, respond by appealing again to the\nidea of benefiting. They hold that individuals alive today (and in the\nfuture) enjoy benefits that result from previous emissions-generating\nactivities and so have a duty to pay at least some of the costs\nincurred in their production. (For discussion see Neumayer [2000: 189], Shue [2014: 186] and\nGosseries [2004: 41\u201355].)\n\nThere is a third challenge. What if persons need to engage in\nactivities which emit greenhouse gases in order to enjoy a decent\nminimum standard of living? Many hold that it is unfair to make\nextremely poor people pay the cost of emitting greenhouse gases where\ndoing so would push them beneath a decent standard of living. More\ngenerally, one might argue that if people are entitled to a certain\nstandard of living (which need not be specified according to\nsufficientarian criteria, but could also be specified according to\negalitarian or prioritarian or some other criteria) then it would be\nwrong to make them pay if doing so entails that they cannot enjoy that\nstandard of living.\n\nIt is worth noting here that if one does think that the existing\nglobal poor should not be required to bear the costs of their\nemissions then this might also be relevant for one\u2019s assessment\nof rich countries\u2019 past emissions. For if developing countries\nnow should not be financially penalised for the emissions that they\nincur when seeking to develop then should not the same be said of the\nemissions incurred by (now affluent) countries when they were also\npoor?\n5.2.2 The Beneficiary Pays Principle\n\nIn light of these kinds of challenges many hold that the Polluter Pays\nPrinciple should be supplemented by other principles. As we have seen\nin the previous subsection some appeal to what has been termed the\nBeneficiary Pays Principle. This holds that agents should pay because,\nand to the extent that, they have benefited from the activities that\ninvolve the emission of greenhouse gases (Page 2012).\n\nThis approach faces a number of questions. One concerns which\nemissions come under its remit. Does it just cover cases that the\nPolluter Pays Principle cannot deal with (e.g., the emissions of the\nprevious generations) (Duus-Otterstr\u00f6m 2014)? Or does it have wider applicability?\n\nSecond, one might query whether benefiting is always sufficient to\nrender someone liable to pay. Someone may, for example, benefit from\nemissions and yet remain very poor. If one thinks that the Polluter\nPays Principle should not be applied in cases where it would push\nsomeone beneath a decent standard of living then one might, for the\nsame reason, think that the Beneficiary Pays Principle is similarly\nconstrained.\n\nNote that if this reasoning is correct it supports the Integrationist\napproach outlined in\n Section 1,\n for it suggests that when answering who should pay one should not\nbracket out more general considerations such as what rights, if any,\npersons have to enjoy a certain standard of living (such as an\n\u201cequal standard of living\u201d or a \u201cminimum standard of\nliving\u201d).\n5.2.3 The Ability to Pay Principle\n\nThis takes us to a third proposed principle. Some have argued that any\nburdens incurred by mitigation and adaptation should be distributed\naccording to agents\u2019 ability to pay. This principle is widely\ninterpreted to mean that the greater an agent\u2019s ability to pay\nthe greater the proportion of the cost that they should be expected to\npay (Shue 2014: 186\u2013189; Moellendorf 2014: esp.\n173\u2013180).\n\nOne criticism of this principle is that it wholly divorces the\nquestion of who pays from questions about who caused the problem or\nwho benefited from causing the problem. In addition to this, some\nargue that it relies on controversial moral assumptions, namely that\nthe wealthy have a positive duty of assistance (Duus-Otterstr\u00f6m\n2014: 451\u2013452).\n\nWhere one stands on the Ability to Pay Principle is likely to depend\non one\u2019s overall account of (global) distributive justice. For\nexample, those who think that global justice requires a more equal\nworld will, other things being equal, endorse a proposal that the\ncosts should be borne primarily by the most advantaged and not by the\nworld\u2019s poorest.\n\n(For further discussion of these three principles and the above\nobjections to them, see Caney 2005, 2010a.)\n5.3 The Political Action Question and First-Order and Second-Order Responsibilities\n\nAlthough much of the literature has focused on who should pay, there\nis another set of questions concerning responsibilities. To approach\nit, it is useful to distinguish between first-order and second-order\nresponsibilities, where a first-order responsibility in this context\nis a responsibility either (a) to mitigate climate change or\nfacilitate adaptation or (b) to bear the costs of mitigation or\nadaptation or both. A second-order responsibility, in this context, is\na responsibility to take action that ensures that others comply with\ntheir first-order (climate) responsibilities. (The distinction between\nfirst- and second-order responsibilities is made by Onora\nO\u2019Neill [2005: 428 & 433\u2013436] and is applied to the\ncase of climate change by Caney [2014a: 134\u2013147].) Second-order\nresponsibilities are responsibilities to change the social, economic\nand political environment so that agents comply with their first-order\nresponsibilities. They can include, for example,\ndisincentivising carbon-intensive options (through, say,\ncarbon taxes or quotas or mandatory regulations) thereby inducing\nagents to comply with a first-order responsibility to mitigate. Or\nthey can involve incentivising others to discharge their\nmitigation responsibilities by, for example, subsidising\nclean sources of energy or by designing the urban environment so that\npeople are more likely to walk or cycle or use public transport rather\nthan drive.\n\nA similar idea is advanced by Elizabeth Cripps who refers to what she\nterms \u201cpromotional duties\u201d (2013: 116 & chapter 6\n[esp. 140\u2013150]). These are \u201c[d]uties to attempt to bring\nabout the necessary collective action\u201d (2013: 116). What actions\nmight these involve? Cripps considers the promotional duties of\nindividuals and suggests that these involve campaigning, running for\nelection, signing petitions, sending letters to politicians, giving\nmoney to environmental organisations, and going on marches (2013:\n143). Walter Sinnott-Armstrong also suggests that citizens have a duty\nto campaign for their governments to implement climate legislation\n(2010: 344). One might also add to this list of second-order\nresponsibilities, duties to engage in civil disobedience and\nresistance against laws that result in unjustified emissions or\ninadequate levels of adaptation.\n\nTwo further points are worth noting. First, much of the focus has been\non what we might term \u201cpositive\u201d second-order\nresponsibilities. They are \u201cpositive\u201d because they require\nagents to take action. Given the arguments above, however, we also\nhave good reason to think that there are \u201cnegative\u201d\nsecond-order responsibilities as well. Whereas a positive second-order\nduty is a duty to take steps to ensure that others comply with their\nfirst-order responsibilities, a negative second-order duty would be a\nduty not to thwart or undermine initiatives to tackle climate change.\nThis is relevant given the argument that some organisations\u2014most\nnotably fossil fuel companies and electric utilities companies, as\nwell as some labour organisations\u2014have gone to considerable\nlengths to undermine attempts to combat climate change (Mildenberger\n2020; Oreskes & Conway 2010: chapter 6; Stokes 2020).\n\nSecond, the focus of many of those philosophers mentioned above has\nbeen on political institutions. While institutions are necessary they\nare likely to be insufficient. To arrive at a systematic and\ncomprehensive account of agents\u2019 second-order responsibilities\nit is worth starting with a political, social and economic analysis of\nwhy agents are not discharging responsibilities to mitigate and adapt.\nIf we start with this we can then work back from it and identify what\nneeds to be done by whom to bring about the necessary change. This is\nhighly likely to involve changing ideologies (for example, those that\nfoster fossil-fuel-driven growth), cultural practices, and social\nnorms, as well as institutions.\n5.4 Who are the Duty Bearers?\n\nWe can turn now to the fourth question. What kind of agent is the\nduty-bearer?\n\nIt is helpful here to focus on responsibilities to mitigate since\nthere has been considerable debate among philosophers as to whether\nindividuals have responsibilities to limit their own personal\nemissions or not. Some, like Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, are sceptical\nof the proposition that individuals have duties to limit their own\nemissions. He considers a large number of separate commonsense moral\nprinciples and argues that none of these can be marshalled to show\nthat individuals have a duty to limit their own emissions. One central\ntheme in his argument is that individuals\u2019 personal emissions\nmake no difference (Sinnott-Armstrong 2010).\n\nTwo kinds of response have been made to these kinds of arguments. The\nfirst disputes the claim that individuals make no difference. Avram\nHiller argues that \n\n\nit is prima facie wrong to perform an act which has an\nexpected amount of harm greater than another easily available\nalternative (Hiller 2011: 352) \n\n\nand argues that individual emissions, while small, violate this\nprinciple. Similarly, Broome argues that individuals\u2019 emissions\ncreate \u201cexpected harm\u201d and they have a duty not to do so\n(Broome 2019). John Nolt argues in the same vein, and calculates the\nimpact of a North Americans\u2019 emissions over their lifetime (Nolt\n2011).\n\nA second response would be to appeal to a different kind of principle.\nFor example, one might argue that we have a duty not to participate in\ncollective processes which generate unjust outcomes. To do so would be\nstand in the wrong kind of relationship to such collective processes.\nSuch a reply might seek to build on the work on\n\u201ccomplicity\u201d by Christopher Kutz (2000). In addition to a\nnegative duty not to participate in such destructive processes one\nmight also argue, as Tracy Isaacs has done, for a duty of individuals\nin \u201ccollective contexts\u201d to form associations and create\nsocial forces for change (Isaacs 2011: chapter 5 esp.\n144\u2013155).\n\nOne further comment is in order. As noted above, while\nSinnott-Armstrong believes that individuals do not have a moral\nresponsibility to limit their emissions he does believe that\nindividuals have political responsibilities to vote and to pressurise\ntheir representatives to pass climate legislation. As Hiller notes,\nthis position may be unstable. The reasons\nSinnott-Armstrong gives as to why individuals do not have mitigation\nresponsibilities (their actions are inconsequential) would, if\ncorrect, also seem to establish that they do not have political\nresponsibilities either. For one person\u2019s vote is also almost\ncertainly inconsequential (Hiller 2011: 364\u2013365).\n\nTo sum up, then, if we consider who has what\nresponsibilities to address climate change, it is helpful to\ndistinguish between four questions. First, who should engage in\nmitigation and adaptation? Second, who should bear any cost involved\nin mitigation and adaptation? Third, who has the responsibility to\nensure that the relevant duty bearers for questions 1 and 2 discharge\ntheir responsibilities? Finally, for each of the above we need to know\n\u201cwhat kind of agent is being ascribed duties?\u201d\n6. Justice and the Greenhouse Gas Budget\n\nOne critical responsibility is to limit the emission of greenhouse\ngases. Many hold that, at the moment, some greenhouse gases can\nnonetheless be permissibly emitted. There is, then, a question about\nhow the use of the remaining \u201cgreenhouse gas budget\u201d can\nbe distributed and among whom. As we have seen the size of the budget\ndepends in part on what temperature target is selected and how risk\naverse we think we should be. To illustrate: the Fifth Assessment\nReport of the IPCC reported that if we want to have a probability of\nat least 67% of avoiding a more than 1.5\u00b0C increase in global mean\ntemperatures then there is a budget of approximately 420\nGtCO2 (Rogelj, Shindell, & Jiang 2019: 108). (If we\noperate with a less ambitious target then the budget is quite\ndifferent. See table 2.2 in Rogelj, Shindell, & Jiang [2019:\n108].)\n\nOne key question then is, \u201cHow should this budget be\nshared?\u201d What principles of distributive justice should be\napplied to this \u201cgood\u201d?\n6.1 Subsistence\n\nOne approach put forward by Henry Shue argues that rights to emit\ngreenhouse gases should be distributed so as to meet peoples\u2019\n\u201csubsistence\u201d needs, and that such emissions should take\npriority over \u201cluxury\u201d emissions (Shue 2014: chapter 2).\nThe focus on meeting basic needs here seems hard to dispute. Many\nphilosophers and environmental campaigners have, however, argued that\nequality should be the guiding principle\u2014and not subsistence (or\nnot merely subsistence).\n6.2 Equality\n\nMany, that is, have endorsed what we might call the \u201cequal\nper capita\u201d view. This holds that rights to emit\ngreenhouse gases should be distributed equally. An important and\ninfluential statement of this position was affirmed by Anil Agarwal\nand Sunita Narain in Global Warming in an Unequal World\n(1991). They start from the premise that the atmosphere is part of the\n\u201cglobal commons\u201d (see also Shiva 2016). They infer from\nthis that it should be divided equally among all human beings. As they\nput it:\n\n\nThe question is how should this global common\u2014the global carbon\ndioxide and methane sinks\u2014be shared amongst the people of the\nworld? \u2026 [I]n a world that aspires to such lofty ideals like\nglobal justice, equity and sustainability, this vital global common\nshould be shared equally on a per capita basis. (Agarwal\n& Narain 1991: 9) \n\n\nSimilar positions have been taken by Dale Jamieson (2010:\n272\u2013273), and Steve Vanderheiden (2008: 107\u2013109 &\nchapter 7 [esp. 226\u2013227]). Peter Singer (2002: 43\u201344) has\nalso argued for it for partly moral and partly pragmatic reasons.\n\nBefore noting objections, it is worth observing that that the\n\u201cequal per capita view\u201d encompasses a family of\nviews and that one might distinguish between many different versions\nof this view. For example, one version holds that countries\nshould be ascribed rights to emit greenhouse gases and that the size of their quota should vary in line with the number of people in their society\n(Agarwal & Narain 1991: 9\u201310). However, one might interpret\nit in a more individualistic way, and ascribe equal rights to emit to each\nindividual.\n\nIn addition to this, there are different ways of treating past (and\ncurrent) emissions. Some, for example, hold that countries have\nemission rights and that a country\u2019s past emissions should be\ndebited from its quota (Neumayer 2000: esp. 186). Others suggest\ndisregarding past emissions and favour applying the equal per\ncapita emissions approach to the remaining budget (Singer 2002:\n43\u201344; Vanderheiden 2008: 229\u2013230). Still others argue\nthat we should phase in the equal per capita view gradually\nover time, and hence high emitters now will have more-than-equal\nemission rights at the start of the transition period, with their\nshare decreasing until it reaches equality (A. Meyer 2000).\n\nA number of different objections might be levelled against the equal\nper capita view (in all versions). First, some query why it\nis appropriate to treat this good in isolation. The equal per\ncapita view is a paradigm case of an isolationist position.\nHowever, theories of distributive justice tend to focus on the fair\ndistribution of a total package of goods (Bell 2008: esp. 250; Caney\n2012: 265\u2013271; Miller 2008: 142\u2013143). Of course,\nsometimes, in special cases, we do treat goods (e.g., rights to vote)\nin isolation, but it is not at all clear why that reasoning should\napply to this case and it is arguable that in these other cases they\nare grounded in a more general integrationist theory.\n\nSecond, it is worth asking why we should care about emissions at all.\nIn themselves they do not matter to the people who generate them or\nwho enjoy the goods and services whose production involves greenhouse\ngas emissions. They matter because they are a by-product of activities\nthat people engage in to serve important human interests. More\nspecifically they largely arise because of energy use (for building,\nheating, cooling, transporting, manufacturing, lighting and so on) and\nbecause of agriculture and land use change. Given this it makes sense\nto focus on protecting and promoting these interests (bearing in mind,\nof course, limits to emissions) not the distribution of emissions\nin themselves. Suppose, for example, that we compare two people, and\nlet us suppose that both enjoy whatever one takes to be the fair\ndistribution of goods overall. Suppose, for simplicity\u2019s sake,\nthat that is an equal standard of living. Suppose, however, that one\nmeets her interests through fossil fuels and the other through solar\nenergy, it is hard to see why that is necessarily unfair to the second\nperson. True they emit less. But that is irrelevant given that they\nenjoy what is, ex hypothesi, the fair standard of living\n(Hayward 2007: 432\u2013433 & 440\u2013444; Caney 2012:\n285\u2013291). In short: to care about emissions is not to care about\nwhat really matters from the point of view of justice.\n\nIt is worth noting that this objection tells not only against\nthe equal per capita view. It has force against all theories of distributive justice that\ntreat the right to emit as a distribuendum. It would, for example,\nbe an objection to the \u201csubsistence emissions\u201d approach\noriginally pioneered by Shue (Hayward 2007).\n\nThere is a third problem with treating emissions as an appropriate\ndistribuendum. The problem is that a dilemma arises when we\nconsider our responsibilities to future generations. There seem to be\nseveral options. Option 1 would be to deny that there are duties of\njustice to future generations to ensure that they too have rights to\nemit greenhouse gases. Perhaps someone might hold that there are no\nduties of justice at all to them (1a). Or they might hold that there\nare but that they do not include leaving them rights to emit (1b).\n(1a) seems implausible in light of the points made in\n Section 3;\n and (1b) adopts a discriminatory attitude to future people that\nstands in need of moral justification.\n\nA second option is to think that future people have rights and hence\nthat, on the view under consideration, they too have an equal right to\nemit greenhouse gases. If, however, one thinks that all current and\nfuture persons are entitled to equal per capita emissions\nthen we face two severe problems. (i) It will be exceptionally\ndifficult, if not impossible, to calculate how much everyone is\nentitled to. Furthermore, (ii), given the number of future and present\npeople included the equal per capita share would surely be\nclose to zero.\n\nIn light of these problems a better way forward would be not\nto focus on emissions per se, but rather to focus on meeting\npeople\u2019s interests in food and energy and so on, and to draw on\nother safe sources to meet these needs. What is imperative is to\ntransition away from a carbon-based economy towards one not dependent\non fossil fuels. Only in this way we can avoid the dilemma set out\nabove.\n7. Justice and Climate Policies\n\nA further set of normative questions arises when we turn to consider\nwhat policies might be adopted to mitigate (and adapt to) climate\nchange. Many policies that have been recommended or adopted themselves\nraise questions of justice. We can see this by considering three\npolicy areas.\n7.1 Mitigation and Alternative Energy Sources\n\nThe first concerns other energy sources. In practice these can raise\nquestions of justice. For example, the construction of hydroelectric\nplants can lead to the displacement of peoples from their homes and\nindigenous peoples from their traditional homelands. The use of\nbiofuels can lead to increased food prices as crops are devoted to\nproducing fuel. The use of nuclear energy can lead to health risks.\nThe salient point here is that mitigation (and adaptation) policies\nmay raise ethical questions.\n\nHow should one address these? One suggestion would be that we should\ndraw on the same principles and values that one employs to evaluate climate\nimpacts. So, if, for example, one thinks that climate change is unjust\nin part because it undermines the. enjoyment of individual human\nrights then it would seem to follow that one should seek to implement\nmitigation (and adaptation) policies that honour these individual\nhuman rights. And, if one thinks climate change is unjust, in part,\nbecause it undermines the cultural rights of indigenous peoples then,\nagain, it would seem to follow one should seek to implement mitigation\n(and adaptation) policies that honour these. One\u2019s answer to the\nchallenges posed by the harmful side-effects of some mitigation\npolicies would then be part of one\u2019s overall theory.\n7.2 Population\n\nSome philosophers have argued that a commitment to preventing\ndangerous climate change requires adopting policies designed to limit\nor reduce world population size (Cafaro 2012; Cripps 2015). Their\nargument is that population growth is one of the main factors\ncontributing to climate change. Other things being equal, more people\nresult in more emissions, so, given the direness of the situation\npolicies need to be implemented which will sufficiently lower world\npopulation size. Some\u2014like Sarah Conly\u2014argue, on this\nbasis, each couple has a right to no more than one child (Conly 2016).\n\n\nAssessing such arguments requires a combination of empirical,\nnormative and political analysis. A first step would be to consider\nall the determinants of climatic harms and to have a\nquantitative analysis of their effects and the extent to which their\necological footprint could be reduced. Such an analysis would include\nnot simply the number of people, but also (1) the levels of\nconsumption, (2) the extent of waste, (3) the nature of the energy\nsystem (does it use renewables or not?), (4) the distribution of\naccess to clean technology, (5) the extent to which energy efficiency\nprogrammes are in place, (6) the extent to which fossil fuels are\nbeing subsidised, (7) the nature of the public transport system, (8)\nthe urban infrastructure and the spatial organisation of cities, (9)\nbuilding design, (10) the extent to which deforestation is reversed,\nand programmes of afforestation and reforestation are pursued, and so\non (Caney 2020). To make a case for a Conly-style conclusion one would\nthen have to show that either:\n\nthe above are insufficient, or\nthe above are (singly or in combination) sufficient but constitute\na less desirable kind of response than limiting procreative choice,\nor, perhaps\nthe above may be sufficient and more desirable than Conly\u2019s\nresponse but they are less politically feasible.\n\n\nAnother challenge facing Conly\u2019s conclusion is that it needs to\nshow that the optimal response turns out to be 1 child per couple and\nthat the same constraint applies equally to all irrespective of the\nsize of their ecological footprint.\n\nEthical concerns about attempts to limit world population have long\nbeen expressed. For example, Maria Mies and Vandana Shiva argued in\nEcofeminism (1993 [2014]) that programmes to limit world\npopulation reinforce control of women\u2019s bodies. Furthermore,\nthey object to proposals to curb world population growth that do not\ncall into question the high consumption lifestyles of affluent\ncountries, and instead convey the morally misleading message that\nresponsibility for the environmental crisis lies with low-emitting\ndeveloping countries (Mies & Vandana 1993 [2014: chapter 19]).\n7.3 Geoengineering\n\nOne additional climate policy needs also be mentioned, namely\n\u201cgeoengineering\u201d the climate system, either by extracting\ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere (Carbon Dioxide Removal) or by\nseeking to block the sun\u2019s rays (Solar Radiation Management).\nThese raise a host of ethical issues.\n\nOne concern is that some forms of geoengineering can have harmful\nside-effects, ones that can harm already vulnerable people (a point\nwhich takes us back to\n Section 7.1).\n For example, some forms of solar radiation management may affect the\nmonsoon season in India (Jamieson 2014: 220).\n\nA second challenge is that while they may constitute a response to\nclimate change in some sense, some geoengineering policies (like Solar\nRadiation Management), do not tackle other greenhouse-gas related\nproblems like ocean acidification, whereas mitigation policies would\n(Jamieson 2014: 220).\n\nA related concern is that geoengineering policies are unnecessary\nbecause other less risky policies (like mitigation) should be\nadopted.\n\nA fourth problem concerns the political legitimacy of decisions to go\nahead with geoengineering. Geoengineering policies can have\nwide-ranging impacts on many countries and so it would be problematic\nfor some to engage in it unilaterally (Jamieson 2014: 222\u2013224).\nIf they are to be legitimate such world-shaping policies would stand\nin need of an inclusive decision-making process that is global in\nscope.\n\n(For rich discussions of the ethical issues surrounding geoengineering\nsee further Gardiner [2010; 2011: chapter 10], Jamieson [2014:\n219\u2013227] and, from a Confucian perspective, Wong [2015].)\n8. Climate Justice in a Nonideal World\n\nThe preceding sections have discussed different questions of justice\nthat arise when considering how to respond to climate change, and they\nhave explored different answers that can be given. One persistent\nfeature of global and domestic climate policies is that there has been\na high level of noncompliance with principles of climate justice.\nGiven this, it is appropriate to ask: \u201cWhat principles of\njustice should apply in the context of noncompliance?\u201d\n\nDifferent responses have been given. To locate them it may be helpful\nto set out the possibilities (Caney 2016).\n\nOne response might be \u201cduty-reallocation\u201d.\nThat is, one might propose a solution in which some bear some of the\nresponsibilities that should, ideally, be borne by others.\nA second response might be to relax the moral\nconstraints on mitigation policies, the aim being to make it more\nlikely that non-complying agents will discharge their duties to\nmitigate.\nA third (related) response might be to adopt other\nextreme responses that one might think are normally unacceptable but\npermissible in an emergency.\nA fourth response might be to take a more proactive\nstance and seek to tackle the underlying structures which lead to\nnoncompliance (for example, by designing institutions which reduce\nsuch noncompliance and undermining organisations which are thwarting\nsuccessful climate action).\nA fifth response might be \u201ctarget\nmodification\u201d. That is, one might lower one\u2019s ambition, so\nwhereas one might think that justice ideally requires a 1.5\u00b0C\ntarget one might accept a less ambitious target.\n\n\nA number of philosophers have argued for a\n type (1)-like response.\n One version maintains that some (the advantaged) should take on more\nthan their fair share of responsibilities. A second version is defended by Broome. He\nargues that current generations ought to reduce their emissions to\ntackle climate change and that they ought to absorb the costs of doing\nso. However, he also thinks that implementing an effective climate\ntreaty is of paramount significance and that parties will not agree to\none if they have to pay. In light of this he suggests that they should\nmitigate but pass on the costs to future generations (Broome 2012:\n47\u201348). Broome thinks this involves an unjust distribution of\ncosts but that it is nonetheless, all things considered, justified\nbecause it helps prevent dangerous climate change. Broome\u2019s\nsolution involves some (current people) making\nothers (future people) bear an unjust burden. A third related\nposition is defended by Eric Posner and David Weisbach (2010). They\nargue that a climate treaty is imperative but will not be feasible\nunless it leaves signatories to the climate treaty no worse off. They\nassume that the benefits from such a treaty will be such that there is\na \u201csurplus\u201d and so no one need be worse off. However, if\nthis assumption does not hold then their commitment to leaving high\nemitters no worse off might also entail that others bear an unjust\nburden (making it a\n type (1) response).\n As they recognise, even if there is a surplus some powerful states\nmay agree to a treaty only if they receive such extensive compensation\nthat it leaves others with more than their fair share of\nresponsibilities or burdens (Posner and Weisbach 2010: 181). \n\nConsider now\n (2):\n some might think that normally one should not convert a place of\ngreat natural beauty into giant fields of solar panels, but they might\nalso think that, in dire circumstances, this prohibition can be\noverturned. If we now consider\n (3):\n many would see geoengineering as a version of this kind of response.\nAnd if we turn to\n (4):\n This is a corollary of some of the views discussed in\n Section 5.3,\n which generally held that agents have political responsibilities to\ncreate just and effective institutions and responsibilities to combat\nongoing campaigns to thwart effective climate action.\n\nWhat response (or combination of responses) one thinks to be the least\nbad here will depend on one\u2019s overall theory of justice.\nSufficientarians, for example, may think that the affluent\u2014those\nabove the specified sufficiency threshold\u2014should take on more\nthan their fair share of burdens, but will reject the idea that any of the world\u2019s\npoorest should be required to adopt\n response (1)\n (unless perhaps it is absolutely necessary for very large numbers of future people to\nenjoy what they are entitled to).\n9. Concluding Remarks\n\nIt is time to conclude. This entry has provided an overview of eight\nquestions of justice that arise in the context of climate change. It\nis salutary to end by noting two points\n\nFirst, it is worth noting that the focus has been on climate\njustice and that justice is not the only relevant value. When\nconfronting the challenges of climate change (and the Anthropocene\nmore generally) justice clearly plays a large role, but many would\nargue for the relevance of other kinds of moral consideration,\nincluding a recognition of the intrinsic value of the natural world.\nClimate ethics, one might say, includes more than justice.\n\nSecond, it is also worth noting that taking climate justice seriously\nmay have major implications for existing economic institutions and\nideologies (such as the valorisation of economic growth), as well as\nfor political institutions (Gardiner 2011; Jamieson 2014). Some\ncritics of the status quo believe that capitalism cannot cope with\nclimate change. Some doubt the ability of our contemporary\ninstitutional architecture to address the current challenges facing\nhumanity. Evaluating such claims clearly requires extensive empirical\nanalysis. Only with the help of climate science, history, politics,\neconomics, anthropology, political economy, sociology, science and\ntechnology studies, and law can we begin to address such claims. But\nphilosophical analysis has its part to play and without an\nunderstanding of climate justice we lack a compass to guide us.",
