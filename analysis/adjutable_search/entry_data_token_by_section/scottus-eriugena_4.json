    "main_text": "Life and Writings || Other Writings\n1.5 Other Writings\n\nA fragmentary Commentary on the Gospel of St. John\n(Commentarius in Evangelium Iohannis) and a sermon\n(Homilia in Johannem) on the Prologue to St. John\u2019s\nGospel were also written probably in the late 860s or 870s. A number\nof interesting poems (Carmina) survive which show the breadth of\nEriugena\u2019s learning; but also portray him as a courtier quite\nwell versed in political affairs. Some poems are written specifically\nin praise of the king, including an important poem, Aulae\nsidereae (Starry Halls) which appears to celebrate the dedication\nof Charles the Bald\u2019s new church in Compigne on 1 May 875. The\npoems show Eriugena\u2019s fascination with Greek and some poems are\nactually written entirely in Greek; and the poems are probably the\nmost Maximean in character through their cosmic Christology. It is\nprobable that Eriugena died sometime around 877. An apocryphal tale,\ndating from the twelfth century, records that Eriugena was stabbed to\ndeath by his students with their pens!\n",
