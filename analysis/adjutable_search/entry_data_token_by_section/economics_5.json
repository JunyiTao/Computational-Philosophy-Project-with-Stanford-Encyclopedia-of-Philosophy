    "main_text": "Six central methodological problems || Reasons versus causes\n2.2 Reasons versus causes\n\nOrthodox theoretical microeconomics is as much a theory of rational\nchoices as it a theory that explains and predicts economic outcomes.\nSince virtually all economic theories that discuss individual choices\ntake individuals as acting for reasons, and thus in some way rational,\nquestions about the role that views of rationality and reasons should\nplay in economics are of general importance. Economists are typically\nconcerned with the aggregate results of individual choices rather than\nwith the actions of particular individuals, but their theories in fact\noffer both causal explanations for why individuals choose as they do\nand accounts of the reasons for their choices. See also the\nentries on\n methodological individualism and\n reasons for action: justification, motivation, explanation.\n\nExplanations in terms of reasons have several features that\ndistinguish them from explanations in terms of causes. Reasons purport to\njustify the actions they explain, and indeed so called\n\u201cexternal reasons\u201d (Williams 1981) only justify action,\nwithout purporting to explain it. Reasons can be evaluated, and they\nare responsive to criticism. Reasons, unlike causes, must be\nintelligible to those for whom they are reasons. On grounds such as\nthese, many philosophers have questioned whether explanations of human\naction can be causal explanations (von Wright 1971, Winch 1958). Yet\nmerely giving a reason \u2014 even an extremely good reason \u2014\nfails to explain an agent\u2019s action, if the reason was not in\nfact \u201ceffective.\u201d Someone might, for example, start\nattending church regularly and give as his reason a concern with\nsalvation. But others might suspect that this agent is deceiving\nhimself and that the minister\u2019s attractive daughter is in fact\nresponsible for his renewed interest in religion. Donald Davidson\n(1963) argued that what distinguishes the reasons that explain an\naction from the reasons that fail to explain it is that the former are\nalso causes of the action. Although the account of rationality within\neconomics differs in some ways from the\n folk psychology\n people tacitly invoke in everyday explanations of actions, many of\nthe same questions carry over (Rosenberg 1976, ch. 5; 1980, Hausman\n2012).\n\nAn additional difference between explanations in terms of reasons and\nexplanations in terms of causes, which some economists have\nemphasized, is that the beliefs and preferences that explain actions\nmay depend on mistakes and ignorance (Knight 1935). As a first\napproximation, economists can abstract from such difficulties caused\nby the\n intentionality\n of belief and desire. They thus often assume that people have perfect\ninformation about all the relevant facts. In that way theorists need\nnot worry about what people\u2019s beliefs are. (If people have\nperfect information, then they believe and expect whatever the facts\nare.) But once one goes beyond this first approximation, difficulties\narise which have no parallel in the natural sciences. Choice depends\non how things look \u201cfrom the inside\u201d, which may be very\ndifferent from the actual state of affairs. Consider for example the\nstock market. The \u201ctrue\u201d value of a stock depends on the\nfuture profits of the company, which are of course uncertain. In 2006\nhouse prices in the U.S. were extremely inflated. But whether they\nwere \u201ctoo high\u201d depended at least in the short run, on\nwhat people believe. They were excellent investments if one could sell\nthem to others who would be willing to pay even more for them.\nEconomists disagree about how significant this subjectivity is.\nMembers of the Austrian school argue that these differences are of\ngreat importance and sharply distinguish theorizing about economics\nfrom theorizing about any of the natural sciences (Buchanan and\nVanberg 1989, von Mises 1981).\n",
