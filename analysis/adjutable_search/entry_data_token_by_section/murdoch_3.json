    "main_text": "Murdoch\u2019s View of the Self Against the Existentialist/Behaviorist Account\n4. Murdoch\u2019s View of the Self Against the Existentialist/Behaviorist Account\n\nMurdoch developed her own view of morality in reaction against both\nHare and (notwithstanding her admiration for it) Sartrean\nexistentialism as she understood it. (For a critique of her take on\nexistentialism, see Moran 2012.) Both viewed freedom as fundamental to\nthe moral enterprise. For Hare the moral agent is free to choose their\nmoral values, constrained only by the requirement that the agent\nprescribe those values universally. Sartre shares the former view but\neschews the universalist \u201clogic of morality\u201d\n constraint.[2]\n For Sartre, anguish (Angst) attends our recognition that our choices\nare totally up to us; Hare\u2019s view lacks that existential\nanguish. But what interests Murdoch is their shared privileging of the\nchoosing will in the moral enterprise, the central image of the moral\nagent as responsible and free (and, in Hare\u2019s case, rational),\nand their rejection of a structure of objective value outside the\nindividual that gives authoritative direction for deciding and\nchoosing. Murdoch sees the appeal of this view, in both its\nexistentialist and analytic forms, but finds it false to our moral\nexperience and to the nature of moral agency.\n\nIn the 1962 \u201cThe Idea of Perfection\u201d (in\nSovereignty), Murdoch begins to develop a contrasting picture\nof the self, moral agency, and moral reality, building on her 1956\n\u201cVision and Choice in Morality\u201d. Her stated target is not\nHare, who is only briefly mentioned, but Stuart Hampshire, whom she\nadmired as a subtler and deeper thinker (and to whom she dedicated\nSovereignty) and whom she regarded, in his 1959 Thought\nand Action, as having articulated and defended much more\nexplicitly than Hare the view of human agency and the self underlying\nHare\u2019s moral theory (largely but not entirely incorporating the\nseven characteristics of Hare\u2019s philosophy mentioned above).\nMurdoch says that the will does not engage in choice out of nowhere,\nbut out of a rich and complex individual psyche formed by ongoing\nattitudes, perceptions, drives, attachments, beliefs, and modes of\nattention. This substantial self is in the process of formation,\nchange, and development all the time; and it provides the context for\nchoice in determinate situations (against\n point 4 above).\n Murdoch notes that sometimes our way of apprehending a particular\nsituation will seem to make so evident to us what we should do that\nprocesses of deliberation standardly underlying choice will not be\nnecessary and we will simply perform the action. We should not, she\nthinks, value a kind of \u201cfreedom\u201d that would exert will\ncontrary to an accurate perception of moral features of the situation\nthat bear on conduct.\n\nMurdoch says that philosophy should develop a moral or philosophical\npsychology that provides the terms in which to understand and\ncharacterize the substantial self to which she gives center stage,\ndisplacing the existentialist/analytic (which she sometimes calls\n\u201cexistentialist-behavioristic\u201d) freely choosing will. This\ncall for a new turn in philosophical ethics toward what came to be\ncalled \u201cmoral psychology\u201d helped to usher in that subject.\nIt somewhat echoed Murdoch\u2019s friend Elizabeth Anscombe\u2019s\nsimilar but more radical and striking charge in her 1958 \u201cModern\nMoral Philosophy\u201d to put the subject of ethics on hold until a\nphilosophical psychology that clarified the notions of intention,\nwill, desire, and belief could be developed. But Anscombe thought of\nphilosophical psychology as an enterprise independent of and prior to\ndoing ethics (Anscombe 1958 [1997: 38]). By contrast Murdoch did not\nthink such a philosophical psychology (a term she also sometimes used\nbut more frequently used \u201cmoral psychology\u201d) could be\nseparated from ethics (OGG: 46/337; Diamond 2010; Brewer 2009:\n8\u20139).\n\nMurdoch takes some steps toward developing such a moral psychology by\nembracing Freud as the great theorist of the human mind, who \n\n\nsees the psyche as an egocentric system of quasi-mechanical energy,\nlargely determined by its own individual history, whose natural\nattachments are sexual, ambiguous, and hard for the subject to\nunderstand or control. (OGG: 51/341) \n\n\nThis substantial self constrains the will much more extensively than\nthe existentialist/analytic picture recognizes. \u201cThe area of\n[the moral agent\u2019s] vaunted freedom of choice is not usually\nvery great\u201d (SGC: 78/364). We cannot easily rid ourselves of\npernicious emotions, attachments and motives that work against moral\nmotivation and behavior. Murdoch adds, \n\n\nIntrospection reveals only the deep tissue of ambivalent motive, and\nfantasy is a stronger force than reason. Objectivity and unselfishness\nare not natural to human beings. (OGG: 51/241) \n\n\nShe sees the Freudian view as \u201ca realistic and detailed picture\nof the fallen man\u201d (OGG: 51/241), one of many places where her\nphilosophy is influenced by a Christian worldview, as she fully\nrecognizes. This pessimistic view of the human psyche plays a central\nrole in Murdoch\u2019s thought for her entire life, bolstered by her\nencounter with Schopenhauer and her particular take on Kant, both of\nwhom articulate a philosophic dualism with a strong egoistic\nanti-moral force countered by a moral force (differing among those\ntwo philosophers) in the psyche.\n",
