    "main_text": "Contractarianism and Justice || Gauthier\n5.1 Gauthier\n\nGauthier (1986) presents the social contract as a bargain between\nrational individuals who can gain through co-operating with one\nanother, but who are competing over the division of the resulting\nsurplus. He assumes that each is interested only in trying to maximise\nhis own welfare, and he also assumes that there is a non-co-operative\nbaseline from which the bargaining begins \u2013 so nobody would\naccept a solution that left her less well off than in the baseline\ncondition. Each person can identify the outcome under which they fare\nbest \u2013 their maximum gain \u2013 but they have no reason to\nexpect others to accept that. Gauthier argues that rational bargainers\nwill converge on the principle of Minimax Relative\nConcession, which requires each to concede the same relative\nproportion of their maximum possible gain relative to the\nnon-co-operative baseline. Thus suppose there is a feasible\narrangement whereby each participant can achieve two-thirds of their\nmaximum gain, but no arrangement under which they all do better than\nthat, then this is the arrangement that the principle recommends. Each\nperson has made the same concession relative to the outcome that is\nbest for them personally \u2013 not accepting the same absolute loss\nof welfare, let it be noted, but the same proportionate loss.\n\nThere are some internal difficulties with Gauthier\u2019s theory that\nneed to be recorded briefly (for a full discussion, see Barry 1989,\nesp. Part III). One is whether Minimax Relative Concession is in fact\nthe correct solution to the bargaining problem that Gauthier\nintroduces, as opposed to the standard Nash solution which (in a\nsimple two-person case) selects the outcome in which the product of\nthe two parties\u2019 utilities is maximised (for discussion of\ndifferent solutions to the bargaining problem, see the entry on\n contemporary approaches to the social contract,\n \u00a7 3.2). A second is whether Gauthier is able to justify positing\na \u2018Lockean\u2019 baseline, under which each is assumed to\nrespect the natural rights of the others, as the starting point for\nbargaining over the surplus \u2013 as opposed to a more conflictual\n\u2018Hobbesian\u2019 baseline in which individuals are permitted to\nuse their natural powers to threaten one another in the process of\nestablishing what each could expect to get in the absence of\nco-operation. But the larger question is whether a contract modelled\nin this way is an appropriate device for delivering principles of\njustice. On the one hand, it captures the idea that the practice of\njustice should work to everyone\u2019s advantage, while requiring all\nthose involved to moderate the demands they make on one another. On\nthe other hand, it prescribes a final distribution of benefit that\nappears morally arbitrary, in the sense that A\u2019s\nbargaining advantage over B \u2013 which stems from the fact\nthat his maximum possible gain is greater than hers \u2013 allows him\nto claim a higher level of benefit as a matter of justice.\nThis seems implausible: there may be prudential reasons to recommend a\ndistribution that reflects the outcome that self-interested and\nrational bargainers would arrive at, but claims of justice need a\ndifferent basis.\n",
