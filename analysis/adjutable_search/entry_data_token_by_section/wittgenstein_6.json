    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein || Philosophical Investigations\n3.2 Philosophical Investigations\n\nPhilosophical Investigations was published posthumously in\n1953. It was edited by G. E. M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees and translated\nby Anscombe. It comprised two parts. Part I, consisting of 693\nnumbered paragraphs, was ready for printing in 1946, but rescinded\nfrom the publisher by Wittgenstein. Part II was added on by the\neditors, trustees of his Nachlass. In 2009 a new edited\ntranslation, by P. M. S. Hacker and Joachim Schulte, was published;\nPart II of the earlier translation, now recognized as an essentially\nseparate entity, was here labeled \u201cPhilosophy of Psychology\n\u2013 A Fragment\u201d (PPF).\n\nIn the Preface to PI, Wittgenstein states that his new\nthoughts would be better understood by contrast with and against the\nbackground of his old thoughts, those in the Tractatus; and\nindeed, most of Part I of PI is essentially questioning. Its\nnew insights can be understood as primarily exposing fallacies in the\ntraditional way of thinking about language, truth, thought,\nintentionality, and, perhaps mainly, philosophy. In this sense, it is\nconceived of as a therapeutic work, viewing philosophy itself\nas therapy. (Part II (PPF), focusing on\nphilosophical psychology, perception etc., was different, pointing to\nnew perspectives (which, undoubtedly, are not disconnected from the\nearlier critique) in addressing specific philosophical issues. It is,\ntherefore, more easily read alongside Wittgenstein\u2019s other\nwritings of the later period.)\n\nPI begins with a quote from Augustine\u2019s\nConfessions which \u201cgive us a particular picture of the\nessence of human language,\u201d based on the idea that \u201cthe\nwords in language name objects,\u201d and that \u201csentences are\ncombinations of such names\u201d (PI 1). This picture of\nlanguage cannot be relied on as a basis for metaphysical, epistemic or\nlinguistic speculation. Despite its plausibility, this reduction of\nlanguage to representation cannot do justice to the whole of human\nlanguage; and even if it is to be considered a picture of only the\nrepresentative function of human language, it is, as such, a poor\npicture. Furthermore, this picture of language is at the base of the\nwhole of traditional philosophy, but, for Wittgenstein, it is to be\nshunned in favor of a new way of looking at both language and\nphilosophy. The Philosophical Investigations proceeds to\noffer the new way of looking at language, which will yield the view of\nphilosophy as therapy.\n",
