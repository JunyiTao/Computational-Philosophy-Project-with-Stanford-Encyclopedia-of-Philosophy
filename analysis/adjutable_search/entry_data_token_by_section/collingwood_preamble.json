    "main_text": "\n\nR. G. Collingwood (1889\u20131943) was a British philosopher and\npractising archaeologist best known for his work in aesthetics and the\nphilosophy of history. During the 1950s and 1960s his philosophy of\nhistory, in particular, occupied centre stage in the debate concerning\nthe nature of explanation in the social sciences and whether or not\nthey are ultimately reducible to explanations in the natural sciences.\nPrimarily through the interpretative efforts of W. H. Dray,\nCollingwood\u2019s work in the philosophy of history came to be seen\nas providing a powerful antidote against Carl Hempel\u2019s claim for\nmethodological unity.\n\nCollingwood is the author of two of the most important treatises in\nmeta-philosophy written in the first half of the twentieth century,\nAn Essay on Philosophical Method (1933), and An Essay on\nMetaphysics (1940). They both contain a sustained discussion of\nthe role and character of philosophical analysis and why the method of\nphilosophy is distinct from and irreducible to the methods of the\nnatural and the exact sciences.\n\nHe is often described as one of the British Idealists, although the\nlabel fails to capture his distinctive kind of idealism, which is\nconceptual rather than metaphysical. In his correspondence with\nGilbert Ryle, Collingwood himself explicitly rejected the label\n\u201cidealist\u201d because he did not endorse the arch-rationalist\nassumptions that shaped much British idealism at the end of the\nnineteenth and the early part of the twentieth century and\nconsequently did not wish to be identified with it.\n\nFrom the mid-thirties onwards Collingwood\u2019s work increasingly\nengaged in a dialogue with the newly emerging school of analytic\nphilosophy. In An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) he attacked the\nneo-empiricist assumptions prevalent in early analytic philosophy and\nadvocated a logical transformation of metaphysics from a study of\nbeing or ontology to a study of the absolute presuppositions or\nheuristic principles which govern different forms of enquiry.\nCollingwood thus occupies a distinctive position in the history of\nBritish philosophy in the first half of the twentieth century. He\nrejects equally the neo-empiricist assumptions that prevailed in early\nanalytic philosophy and the kind of metaphysics that the analytical\nschool sought to overthrow. His logical reform of metaphysics also\nensures a distinctive role and subject matter for philosophical\nenquiry and is thus far from advocating a merely therapeutic\nconception of philosophy or the dissolution of philosophical into\nlinguistic analysis in the manner of ordinary language philosophy.\n\nSee the separate entry for a discussion of\n Collingwood\u2019s aesthetics.\n",
