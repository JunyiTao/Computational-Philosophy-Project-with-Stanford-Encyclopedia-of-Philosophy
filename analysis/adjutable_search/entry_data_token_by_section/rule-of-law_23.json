What is the relation between the Rule\nof Law and the concept of law? A case can be made\u2014controversial,\nno doubt\u2014for bringing the two of them together (see Waldron 2008\nand also Simmonds 2008). The concept of law could be understood to\nembrace the fundamental elements of legality, though this\nidentification looks less plausible the more substantive the\nconception of the Rule of Law is held to be. On this account, a system\nof governance doesn\u2019t count as law unless it exhibits the\ncharacteristic forms and processes that we associate with legality.\nOtherwise we lose our sense of the institutional distinctiveness of\nlaw as a way of ruling a society. We saw earlier that Lon Fuller (1958\nand 1964) envisaged a connection along these lines. So, in his later\nwork did Ronald Dworkin. Dworkin (2004) asked us to consider a\nsituation in which judges and lawyers were grappling with hard issues\nof interpretation or with difficult dilemmas posed by multiple sources\nof law. He said that in such cases, we might say that what was\nrequired as a matter of law might be different from what was required\nas a matter of justice. That is a familiar separation (even if Dworkin\nthought it was narrower and more blurred than most legal positivists\nbelieved). But he said, it would make no sense to say that what was\nrequired as a matter of legality or respect for the Rule of Law was\ndifferent from what the legal solution was to this case. To figure out\nthe legal solution we have to address the various legal and political\nmaterials precisely in light of our commitment to legality. \n\n\nA conception of legality is \u2026 a general account of how to\ndecide which particular claims are true\u2026. We could make little\nsense of either legality or law is we denied this intimate connection.\n(Dworkin 2004: 24\u20135)\n\n\nHowever this is not the received position. According to Joseph Raz\n(1977) and others you cannot understand what the Rule of Law is unless\nyou already and independently understand what law is and the\ncharacteristic evils that law is likely to give rise to (which the\nRule of Law tries to prevent). On this account, legality represents a\nparticular set of concerns about law that have emerged in our\ncivilization. The fact that these concerns are undoubtedly moral in\ncharacter (even though they are not comprehensive moral concerns)\nmeans that\u2014in Raz\u2019s view\u2014it is better to keep them\nseparate from the concept of law itself, for fear of introducing a\nmoral element into that concept.\n",
