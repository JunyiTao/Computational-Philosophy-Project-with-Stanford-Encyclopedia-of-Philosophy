    "main_text": "Life and Works || Sources\n1.2 Sources\n\nApart from the surviving fragments of his writings, our knowledge of\nArchytas\u2019 life and work depends heavily on authors who wrote in\nthe second half of the fourth century, in the fifty years after\nArchytas\u2019 death. Archytas\u2019 importance both as an\nintellectual and as a political leader is reflected in the number of\nwritings about him in this period, although only fragments of these\nworks have been preserved. Aristotle wrote a work in three volumes on\nthe philosophy of Archytas, more than on any other of his\npredecessors, as well as a second work, consisting of a summary of\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus and the writings of Archytas (A13).\nUnfortunately almost nothing of these works has survived. Scholars\nhave generally regarded them as authentic (Huffman 2005: 583\u201394)\nbut Schofield has recently raised some doubts (2014: 81\u20132).\nAristotle\u2019s pupil Eudemus discussed Archytas prominently in his\nhistory of geometry (A6 and A14) and in his work on physics (A23 and\nA24). Another pupil of Aristotle\u2019s, Aristoxenus, wrote a\nLife of Archytas, which is the basis for much of the\nbiographical tradition about him (A1, A7, A9). Aristoxenus (375-ca.\n300) was in a good position to have accurate information about\nArchytas. He was born in Tarentum and grew up during the height of\nArchytas\u2019 prominence in the city. In addition to whatever\npersonal knowledge he had of Archytas, he draws on his own father\nSpintharus, who was a younger contemporary of Archytas, as a source\n(e.g., A7). Aristoxenus began his philosophical career as a\nPythagorean and studied with the Pythagorean Xenophilus at Athens, so\nthat it is not surprising that his portrayal of Archytas is largely\npositive. Nonetheless, Archytas\u2019 opponents are given a fair\nhearing (e.g., Polyarchus in A9), and Archytas himself is represented\nas not without small flaws of character (A7). Other fourth-century\nsources such as the Seventh Letter in the Platonic corpus and\nDemosthenes\u2019 (?) Erotic Oration focus on the connection\nbetween Archytas and Plato (see below).\n",
