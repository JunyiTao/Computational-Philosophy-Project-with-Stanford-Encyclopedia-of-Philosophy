As a formal measure to ensure relevance, they\npropose a \u201cvariable sharing condition\u201d. Variable sharing\nis generally thought to be only a necessary condition for relevance,\nhowever, and the project of describing sufficient formal conditions is\nongoing.\n\nConnexive logicians aim instead to make good of the intuition that for\na conditional statement to be true, the negation of its consequent\nshould be incompatible with its antecedent. This requirement on the\ntruth of conditional statements has a formidable history, appearing in\nlogical manuscripts of the Stoic philosophers Chrysippus and Sextus\nEmpiricus and evidently garnering more support at the time than the\ncontrary opinion of Philo of Melaga. A related idea appears already in\nthe Prior Analytics, where Aristotle claimed that it is\nimpossible that if not A, then A. This, \u201cAristotle\u2019s\nthesis\u201d, can be formalized as \\(\\neg (\\neg\\rA\\supset\\rA)\\),\nwhich is obviously invalid both classically and intuitionistically.\nSometimes instead the formula \\(\\neg (\\rA\\supset\\neg\\rA)\\) is called\nAristotle\u2019s thesis. Systems of connexive logic accept both as\naxioms, as well as the principles\n\\((\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\supset\\neg(\\rA\\supset\\neg\\rB)\\) and\n\\((\\rA\\supset\\neg\\rB)\\supset\\neg(\\rA\\supset\\rB)\\), which purport to\nformalize the original idea attributed to Chrysippus above. (These\nlatter two principles are interderivable, over the base theory ipc,\nwith Aristotle\u2019s theses).\n\nBy including as theorems principles that are classically invalid, such\nlogics risk trivialization because of the maximality of cpc.\nSome approaches address this problem by\nrejecting classical principles such as the \\(\\wedge\\)-elimination rule\nof natural deduction, avoiding thereby any formula and its negation\nbeing theorems. Other approaches are \u201cparaconsistent\u201d,\ni.e., they allow theorems A and \\(\\neg\\rA\\) but do not allow the\nderivation of arbitrary formulas from this contradiction.\nParaconsistent approaches are often interpretable with the 4-valued\ntruth-assignment mentioned above.\n",
