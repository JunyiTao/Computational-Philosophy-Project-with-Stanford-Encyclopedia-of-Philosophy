Accuracy\n\nGenerationist forms of content variantism raise the question of\naccuracy in memory in an especially vivid way: if the content of the\nretrieved representation can differ from that of the trace, which can\nin turn differ from that of the perceptual\nrepresentation\u2014or if,\nas the simulation theory claims, there need be no trace linking the\nretrieved representation and the perceptual\nrepresentation\u2014there\nwould seem to be no guarantee that memory provides us with accurate\nrepresentations of past events. Generationist forms of content\nvariantism do not, however, guarantee inaccuracy, and preservationist\nforms of content variantism do not guarantee accuracy, for the\naccuracy of memory has two distinct dimensions.\n",
