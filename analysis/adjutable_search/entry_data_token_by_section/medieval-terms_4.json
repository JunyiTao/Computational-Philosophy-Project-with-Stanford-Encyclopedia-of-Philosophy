    "main_text": "Appellation\n5. Appellation\n\nPerhaps the term with the most varied history is\n\u2018appellatio\u2019, though even so, one can discern a common\nthread running through it. It starts, we saw, as an equivalent of\n\u2018nominatio\u2019 in Anselm and Abelard, and by the thirteenth\ncentury is used to pick out the present extension of a term, that of\nwhich it can be truly predicated in the present tense: \u201cSo now\none should know that appellation is spoken of in four ways \u2026 In\nthe fourth way, appellation is said to be the acceptance of a term for\na suppositum or supposita existing actually, and our present focus is\non appellation spoken of in this fourth way\u201d (Lambert, tr.\nMaloney pp.\n 261\u20132).[34]\n In Burley, at the turn of the fourteenth century, it almost usurps\nthe place of \u2018copulatio\u2019, being for him the relation of\nthe predicate to its inferiors: \u201cThus, just as supposition taken\nstrictly is a property of the subject insofar as it is matched with\nthe predicate, so appellation is a property of the predicate matched\nwith the subject or with an inferior\u201d (De Puritate, tr.\nSpade p.\n 131).[35]\n There are shades too, of Abelard: \u201ca univocal general term\nappellates its inferiors but does not signify\n them\u201d.[36]\n But the crucial phrase which runs through the history of the term\nappears here too: \u201cthe predicate appellates its form\u201d\n(ed. Boehner, p. 48: \u201cpraedicatum appellat suam\nformam\u201d). What Burley says he means by this is that the\npredicate should be truly predicable at some time, in the present\ntense, of the supposita of the subject.\n\nIt is ampliation and restriction which distinguish this property of\nthe predicate from properties of the subject. For, on the standard\naccount, the subject may be ampliated, or restricted, by the predicate\n(or by the copula or other signs), but the predicate itself is never\nampliated or restricted: as we saw above, \u2018A white thing was\nblack\u2019 is true only if \u2018black\u2019 has at some time been\ntruly predicable of the supposita of the subject, namely, of what is\nor was white. In contrast, \u2018A white thing is black\u2019 may\nnever have been true \u2013 indeed, in this case, it never will have\nsince it is self-contradictory. So the subject does not always\n\u201cappellate its form\u201d, that is, one must use a\ndemonstrative to give the truth-conditions of such propositions (see\nPanaccio 2012, \u00a72 esp. p. 144\u20135). A consequence pointed out by\nJohn Buridan, among\n others,[37]\n is that conversion needs application with care in such cases.\nConsider \u2018The just will be justly damned\u2019: this can be\ntrue, if those who are just sin in the future. But \u2018Justly will\nthe just be damned\u2019 is false, for \u2018Justly are the just\ndamned\u2019 will never be true. Similarly, \u2018Socrates\napproaching you know\u2019 can be true while \u2018You know Socrates\napproaching\u2019 (the \u201chooded man\u201d fallacy from\nAristotle\u2019s De Sophisticis Elenchis 179b1\u20133) may\nbe false (for you know Socrates, but do not recognize him\napproaching). It is explained by reason of the fact that the predicate\nappellates its form (for \u2018You know Socrates approaching\u2019\nrequires that the predicate \u2018know Socrates approaching\u2019 be\ntrue of you and so is false), whereas \u2018Socrates approaching you\nknow\u2019 requires only that \u2018Him you know\u2019 be true,\nreferring to Socrates, and it is true. The doctrine of appellation\ncould thus be used to diagnose familiar fallacies.\n\nScott, in his discussion of Buridan\u2019s treatment of the sophism,\n\u2018You know the one approaching\u2019 (pp. 42\u20139), claims\nthat Buridan\u2019s concept of appellation (which he misleadingly\ntranslates as \u2018connotation\u2019) in his diagnosis is novel,\nand Spade follows him in his commentary on Peter of Ailly (p.109\nn.188). But the notion is clearly continuous with Burley\u2019s in\nthat \u2018appellating its form\u2019 requires true predication via\na demonstration. Indeed, it is continuous with Lambert\u2019s usage,\nfor \u2018chimera\u2019 has no appellata precisely because\n\u2018hoc est chimera\u2019 (\u2018This is a chimera\u2019) is\nfalse whatever is demonstrated. Admittedly, Buridan explicitly\nrestricts appellation to appellative terms, that is, \u201cevery term\nconnoting something other than what it supposits for\u201d\n(Summulae de Dialectica: Treatise on Suppositions, tr. Klima,\np. 291), and it \u201cappellates that which it connotes as pertaining\nto that which it supposits for\u201d. Thus \u2018white\u2019\nconnotes whiteness and supposits for white things. What appears to be\nnovel in Buridan is the extension of the doctrine to intentional\nverbs, which, Buridan says, cause the terms following them (the\npredicate, or part of the predicate) to appellate their\nrationes, that is, the concepts by which they signify what\nthey do. Thus in \u2018You know Socrates approaching\u2019, the\nexpression \u2018Socrates approaching\u2019 appellates its concept,\nthe ratio \u2018Socrates approaching\u2019, and so the\nproposition is false unless you are aware who it is; whereas in\n\u2018Socrates approaching you know\u2019, the subject\n\u2018Socrates approaching\u2019 appellates its concept only under\ndisjunction to the rationes of other possible substituents in\nthe same grammatical position, and so it suffices that \u2018Him you\nknow\u2019 be true, where \u2018him\u2019 refers to Socrates under\nsome concept or\n other.[38]\n",
