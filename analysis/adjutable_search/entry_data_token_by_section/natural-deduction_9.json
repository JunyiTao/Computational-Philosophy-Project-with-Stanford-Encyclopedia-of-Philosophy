    "main_text": "Normalization || Normalization of Intuitionistic Logic\n5.1 Normalization of Intuitionistic Logic\n\nGentzen (1934) remarked that the introduction rules were like\ndefinitions of the logical operators, and that the elimination rules\nwere consequences of their definitions. Making this remark precise is\nnot easy, but it has an intuitive plausibility. In the\nparadigmatically simple case of conjunction, the premises needed for\nan application of \\(\\land\\)-I are simply the two conjuncts, so the\nrule can be seen as \u201cdefining\u201d a conjunction to be true in\nthe case that both of its conjuncts are. In an application of\n\\(\\land\\)-E, the conclusion is one of the conjuncts, and so something\nthat has to be true if the conjunction is, supposing conjunction to be\n\u201cdefined\u201d that way. For other operators it is a bit less\nstraightforward. The required subproof for \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I is one in\nwhich the consequent is derived from the antecedent: thought of as a\ndefinition, this says that \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) is true just in case\n\\(B\\) is (somehow) obtainable from \\(A\\). The rule of\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)-E can be seen as a kind of consequence: to infer \\(B\\)\nfrom the (major) premiss \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and the (minor) premiss\n\\(A\\) is to treat \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) as licensing one to infer \\(B\\)\nwhen \\(A\\) is given. (The special rules needed for Classical logic are\nharder to fit into this framework, an issue we discuss further, in the\ncontext of harmony, which we introduce in\n \u00a77.)\n\nIgnoring, for now, the metaphor of defining a connective (we will come\nback to it in\n \u00a77),\n there is a formal point here. If, in constructing a derivation, one\nuses an introduction rule to get a formula with a certain main\noperator, and then applies the corresponding elimination rule with\nthat formula as (major) premiss, one has made an avoidable\n\u201cdetour\u201d in the argumentation. It is easy to see in many\ncases that the detour could have been avoided: to use \\(\\land\\)-E in\nthis way is just to obtain (a second copy of) a formula that was\nalready there to be used as a premiss of the \\(\\land\\)-I,. Similarly,\nusing \\(\\rightarrow\\)-E after \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I could be obtained more\ndirectly: the minor premise is an occurrence of the same formula as\nthe hypothesis of the \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I subproof, so simply use the\nsteps of the subproof as lines of the main proof.\n\nGentzen saw that this could be generalized, at least for the system\nfor intuitionistic logic. Call the \u201croute straightening\u201d\nmodifications to a derivation described in the previous paragraphs\n(i.e., deleting the \u201cdetour\u201d conjunction or conditional\nand taking a premiss of the former introduction rule as the\nconclusion, or obtaining the conclusion by means of argumentation from\nthe subproof for the introduction rule), and analogous modifications\nfor the other operators, an immediate reduction. Then, roughly, his\nresult (now called the Normalization Theorem) is that any derivation\ncan be transformed by a sequence of immediate reductions into a\nderivation in normal form, in which no (occurrence of) a formula\nobtained by one of the introduction rules is used as the major premiss\nof an elimination rule. We give examples of immediate reductions in\n figure 6.\n This is rough because of an annoying complication in the cases of the\nelimination rules (\\(\\lor\\)-E, \\(\\exists\\)-E) which involve\nsubproofs.\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 6: Examples of Immediate\nReductions. [An\n extended description of figure 6\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThere are two variant forms of the complication. (1) A formula is\nobtained by an introduction rule and then reiterated into the\nsubproof, and then used as the major premiss of an elimination rule\nthere: the needed immediate reduction for this\nintroduction-elimination detour isn\u2019t possible because the\nmaterial (premiss, premises, subproof) needed isn\u2019t available in\nthe subproof of the \\(\\lor\\)-E or \\(\\exists\\)-E. (Note that this\nproblem can\u2019t arise if we have a Gentzen-style presentation of\nnatural deduction: where a Fitch-style derivation uses reiteration to\nget a second copy of a formula, the Gentzen-style derivation just\nrepeats the whole argumentation leading to the formula above each of\nits occurrences.) The fix for this is conceptually simple (though in\nsome cases it can lead to an increase in total derivation size, since\nit can involve installing multiple copies of many formulas): instead\nof reiterating the formula into the subproof, reiterate whatever was\nneeded to derive it, derive it by the introduction rule within the\nsubproof, and proceed to the immediate reduction. (2) The conclusion\nof the \\(\\lor\\)-E or \\(\\exists\\)-E inference, which is also the last\nline of the subproof(s), is obtained by an introduction rule inside\nthe subproof, and is then used as the (major) premiss of an\nelimination rule in the main derivation. Again, an immediate reduction\nof the detour is not possible: the conclusion is in the main\nderivation, but the materials needed for its direct derivation are\navailable only in the subproof(s). It is perhaps a little less obvious\nthat the fix for this works, but it is again conceptually simple: do\nthe second elimination inference inside the subproof(s), so its\nconclusion is the last line of the subproof(s), and then take its\nconclusion in place of the original as the conclusion of the main\n\\(\\lor\\)-E or \\(\\exists\\)-E inference. Call modifications of this sort\nto a derivation permutative reductions. Then the less rough statement\nof Gentzen\u2019s theorem is that any derivation (in the natural\ndeduction system for intuitionistic logic) can be converted, by a\nsequence of immediate and permutative reductions, into the normal\nform, in which no occurrence of a formula is both the conclusion of an\nintroduction rule and the major premiss of an elimination rule.\nDerivations in normal form have interesting and useful properties.\nPerhaps the most noteworthy is the subformula property: every\nformula in a normal derivation is a subformula of (that is, either\nidentical to or a part of) either an undischarged hypothesis or the\nfinal conclusion.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Example of Permutative\nReduction. [An\n extended description of figure 7\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs an example of the applications of normalization theorems, the fact\nthat normal derivations have the subformula property has implications\nfor the decision problems. In propositional logic, there are only\nfinitely many subformulas of the (finitely many) initial premises and\nconclusion, so a normal derivation can contain occurrences only of\nfinitely many formulas. This (with a bit more work) implies that there\nis a finite upper bound on the size of possible normal derivations of\na given conclusion from given premisses, so the propositional logic is\n(in principle!) decidable by an exhaustive search of possible\nderivations (Gentzen 1934 proves the decidability of Intuitionistic\npropositional logic in essentially this way, appealing to his\nHauptsatz for the sequent calculus rather than normalization\nfor natural deduction.) Turning to First Order logic, normal\nderivations have only a looser subformula property: for every free\nvariable, the instance \\(F(a)\\) substituting that free variable for\nthe quantified variable counts as a subformula of \\(\\forall xF(x)\\)\nand \\(\\exists xF(x)\\). First order logic is, of course, undecidable:\nwhat this shows is that no upper bound can be computed for the number\nof distinct instances of a quantification that need to occur in\n\\(\\forall\\)-I or \\(\\exists\\)-E subproofs in the proof of a valid\nformula of a given length.\n",
