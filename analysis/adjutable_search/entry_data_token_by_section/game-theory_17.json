We can now return to the branch point left off several\nparagraphs back, where this stream of investigation meets that coming\nfrom evolutionary game theory. There is no serious doubt that, by\ncomparison to other non-eusocial animals\u2014including our nearest\nrelatives, chimpanzees and bonobos\u2014humans achieve prodigious\nfeats of coordination (see\n Section 4)\n (Tomasello et al. 2004). A lively controversy, with important philosophical\nimplications and fought on both sides with game-theoretic arguments,\nwent on for some time over whether this capacity can be wholly\nexplained by cultural adaptation, or is better explained by inference\nto a genetic change early in the career of H. sapiens.\n\nHenrich et al.\n (2004,\n 2005) have run a series of experimental games with\npopulations drawn from fifteen small-scale human societies in South\nAmerica, Africa, and Asia, including three groups of foragers, six\ngroups of slash-and-burn horticulturists, four groups of nomadic\nherders, and two groups of small-scale agriculturists. The games\n(Ultimatum, Dictator, Public Goods) they implemented all place\nsubjects in situations broadly resembling that of the Trust game\ndiscussed in the previous section. That is, Ultimatum and Public Goods\ngames are scenarios in which both social welfare and each\nindividual\u2019s welfare are optimized (Pareto efficiency achieved)\nif and only if at least some players use strategies that are not\nsub-game perfect equilibrium strategies (see\n Section 2.6).\n In Dictator games, a narrowly selfish first mover would capture all\navailable profits. Thus in each of the three game types, SPE players\nwho cared only about their own monetary welfare would get outcomes\nthat would involve highly inegalitarian payoffs. In none of the\nsocieties studied by Henrich et al. (or any other society in\nwhich games of this sort have been run) are such outcomes observed.\nThe players whose roles are such that they would take away all but\nepsilon of the monetary profits if they and their partners played SPE\nalways offered the partners substantially more than epsilon, and even\nthen partners sometimes refused such offers at the cost of receiving\nno money. Furthermore, unlike the traditional subjects of experimental\neconomics\u2014university students in industrialized\ncountries\u2014Henrich et al.\u2019s subjects did not even\nplay Nash equilibrium strategies with respect to monetary\npayoffs. (That is, strategically advantaged players offered larger\nprofit splits to strategically disadvantaged ones than was necessary\nto induce agreement to their offers.) Henrich et al.\ninterpret these results by suggesting that all actual people, unlike\n\u2018rational economic man\u2019, value egalitarian outcomes to\nsome extent. However, their experiments also show that this extent\nvaries significantly with culture, and is correlated with variations\nin two specific cultural variables: typical payoffs to cooperation\n(the extent to which economic life in the society depends on\ncooperation with non-immediate kin) and aggregate market integration\n(a construct built out of independently measured degrees of social\ncomplexity, anonymity, privacy, and settlement size). As the values of\nthese two variables increase, game behavior shifts (weakly) in the\ndirection of Nash equilibrium play. Thus the researchers conclude that\npeople are naturally endowed with preferences for egalitarianism, but\nthat the relative weight of these preferences is programmable by\nsocial learning processes conditioned on local cultural cues.\n\nIn evaluating Henrich et al.\u2019s interpretation of these\ndata, we should first note that no axioms of RPT, or of the various\nmodels of decision mentioned in\n Section 8.1,\n which are applied jointly with game theoretic modeling to human\nchoice data, specify or entail the property of narrow selfishness.\n(See\n Ross (2005a)\n ch. 4;\n Binmore (2005b)\n and\n (2009);\n and any economics or game theory text that lets the mathematics speak\nfor itself.) Orthodox game theory thus does not predict that people\nwill play SPE or NE strategies derived by treating their own monetary\npayoffs as equivalent to utility.\n Binmore (2005b)\n is therefore justified in criticizing Henrich et al for\nrhetoric suggesting that their empirical work embarrasses orthodox\ntheory. \n\nThis is not to suggest that the anthropological interpretation of the\nempirical results should be taken as uncontroversial. Binmore\n (1994,\n 1998,\n 2005a,\n 2005b) has argued for many years, based on a wide range of\nbehavioral data, that when people play games with non-relatives they\ntend to learn to play Nash equilibrium with respect to utility\nfunctions that approximately correspond to income functions. As he\npoints out in\n Binmore (2005b),\n Henrich et al.\u2019s data do not test this hypothesis for\ntheir small-scale societies, because their subjects were not exposed\nto the test games for the (quite long, in the case of the Ultimatum\ngame) learning period that theoretical and computational models\nsuggest are required for people to converge on NE. When people play\nunfamiliar games, they tend to model them by reference to games they\nare used to in everyday experience. In particular, they tend to play\none-shot laboratory games as though they were familiar\nrepeated games, since one-shot games are rare in normal\nsocial life outside of special institutional contexts. Many of the\ninterpretive remarks made by Henrich et al. are consistent\nwith this hypothesis concerning their subjects, though they\nnevertheless explicitly reject the hypothesis itself. What is\ncontroversial here\u2014the issues of spin around\n\u2018orthodox\u2019 theory aside\u2014is less about what the\nparticular subjects in this experiment were doing than about what\ntheir behavior should lead us to infer about human evolution.\n\nGintis (2004),\n (2009a) argues that data of the sort we have been discussing\nsupport the following conjecture about human evolution. Our ancestors\napproximated maximizers of individual fitness. Somewhere along the\nevolutionary line these ancestors arrived in circumstances where\nenough of them optimized their individual fitness by acting so as to\noptimize the welfare of their group\n (Sober and Wilson 1998)\n that a genetic modification went to fixation in the species: we\ndeveloped preferences not just over our own individual welfare, but\nover the relative welfare of all members of our communities, indexed\nto social norms programmable in each individual by cultural\nlearning. Thus the contemporary researcher applying game theory to\nmodel a social situation is advised to unearth her subjects\u2019\nutility functions by (i) finding out what community (or communities)\nthey are members of, and then (ii) inferring the utility function(s)\nprogrammed into members of that community (communities) by studying\nrepresentatives of each relevant community in a range of games and\nassuming that the outcomes are correlated equilibria. Since the\nutility functions are the dependent variables here, the games must be\nindependently determined. We can typically hold at least the strategic\nforms of the relevant games fixed, Gintis supposes, by virtue of (a)\nour confidence that people prefer egalitarian outcomes, all else being\nequal, to inegalitarian ones within the culturally evolved\n\u2018insider groups\u2019 to which they perceive themselves as\nbelonging and (b) a requirement that game equilibria are drawn from\nstable attractors in plausible evolutionary game-theoretic models of\nthe culture\u2019s historical dynamics.\n\nRequirement (b) as a constraint on game-theoretic modeling of general\nhuman strategic dispositions is no longer very controversial\u2014or,\nat least, is no more controversial than the generic adaptationism in\nevolutionary anthropology of which it is one expression. However, many\ncommentators are skeptical of Gintis\u2019s suggestion that there was\na genetic discontinuity in the evolution of human sociality. (For a\ncognitive-evolutionary anthropology that explicitly denies such\ndiscontinuity, see\n Sterelny 2003.)\n Based partly on such skepticism (but more directly on behavioral\ndata) Binmore\n (2005a,\n 2005b) resists modeling people as having built-in preferences\nfor egalitarianism. According to Binmore\u2019s\n (1994,\n 1998,\n 2005a)\n model, the basic class of strategic problems facing non-eusocial\nsocial animals are coordination games. Human communities evolve\ncultural norms to select equilibria in these games, and many of these\nequilibria will be compatible with high levels of apparently\naltruistic behavior in some (but not all) games. Binmore argues that\npeople adapt their conceptions of fairness to whatever happen to be\ntheir locally prevailing equilibrium selection rules. However, he\nmaintains that the dynamic development of such norms must be\ncompatible, in the long run, with bargaining equilibria among\nself-regarding individuals. Indeed, he argues that as societies evolve\ninstitutions that encourage what Henrich et al. call\naggregate market integration (discussed above), their utility\nfunctions and social norms tend to converge on self-regarding economic\nrationality with respect to welfare. This does not mean that Binmore\nis pessimistic about the prospects for egalitarianism: he develops a\nmodel showing that societies of broadly self-interested bargainers can\nbe pulled naturally along dynamically stable equilibrium paths towards\nnorms of distribution corresponding to Rawlsian justice\n (Rawls 1971).\n The principal barriers to such evolution, according to Binmore, are\nprecisely the kinds of other-regarding preferences that conservatives\nvalorize as a way of discouraging examination of more egalitarian\nbargaining equilibria that are within reach along societies\u2019\nequilibrium paths.\n\nResolution of this debate between Gintis and Binmore fortunately need\nnot wait upon discoveries about the deep human evolutionary past that\nwe may never have. The models make rival empirical predictions of some\ntestable phenomena. If Gintis is right then there are limits, imposed\nby the discontinuity in hominin evolution, on the extent to which\npeople can learn to be self-regarding. This is the main significance\nof the controversy discussed above over Henrich et\nal.\u2019s interpretation of their field data. Binmore\u2019s\nmodel of social equilibrium selection also depends, unlike\nGintis\u2019s, on widespread dispositions among people to inflict\nsecond-order punishment on members of society who fail to sanction\nviolators of social norms.\n Gintis (2005)\n shows using a game theory model that this is implausible if\npunishment costs are significant. However,\n Ross (2008a)\n argues that the widespread assumption in the literature that\npunishment of norm-violation must be costly results from failure to\nadequately distinguish between models of the original evolution of\nsociality, on the one hand, and models of the maintenance and\ndevelopment of norms and institutions once an initial set of them has\nstabilized. Finally, Ross also points out that Binmore\u2019s\nobjectives are as much normative as descriptive: he aims to show\negalitarians how to diagnose the errors in conservative\nrationalisations of the status quo without calling for revolutions\nthat put equilibrium path stability (and, therefore, social welfare)\nat risk. It is a sound principle in constructing reform proposals that\nthey should be \u2018knave-proof\u2019 (as Hume put it), that is,\nshould be compatible with less altruism than might prevail in\npeople.\n",
