A recent review of initiatives for\nimproving data sharing identified the awarding of open data and open\nmaterials badges as the most effective scheme (Rowhani-Farid, Allen,\n& Barnett 2017). One such badge scheme is coordinated by the\nCenter for Open Science who currently award three badges: Open Data,\nOpen Materials and Pre-Registration. Badges are attached to articles\nthat follow a specific set of criteria to engage in these activities.\nKidwell et al. (2016) evaluated the effectiveness of badges in the\njournal Psychological Science and found substantial increases\n(from 3 to 39%) in data sharing over a less than two-year period. Such\nincreases were not found in similar journals without badge schemes\nover the same period.\n\n",
