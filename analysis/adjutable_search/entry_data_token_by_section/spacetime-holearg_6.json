    "main_text": "Unhappy Consequences\n6. Unhappy Consequences\n\nWe can now assemble the pieces above to generate unhappy consequences\nfor the manifold substantivalist. Consider the two distributions of\nmetric and material fields related by a hole transformation. Since the\nmanifold substantivalist denies Leibniz Equivalence, the\nsubstantivalist must hold that the two systems represent distinct\nphysical systems. But the properties that distinguish the two are very\nelusive. They escape both (a) observational verification and (b) the\ndetermining power of cosmological theory.\n\n(a) Observational verification. The substantivalist must\ninsist that it makes a physical difference whether the galaxy passes\nthrough event \\(E\\) or not. But we have already noticed that the\ntwo distributions are observationally equivalent: no observation can\ntell us if we are in a world in which the galaxy passes through event\n\\(E\\) or misses event \\(E\\).\n\nIt might be a little hard to see from Figure 6 that the two\ndistributions are observationally equivalent. In the first\ndistribution on the left, the middle galaxy moves in what looks like a\nstraight line and stays exactly at the spatial midpoint between the\ngalaxies on either side. In the second distribution on the right, all\nthat seems to be undone. The galaxy looks like it accelerates in\ntaking a swerve to the right, so that it moves closer to the galaxy on\nits right.\n\nThese differences that show up in the portrayal of Figure 6 are all\nnon-invariant differences. For the right hand distribution, the galaxy\ndoes veer to the right in the figure, but at the same time, distances\nbetween events get stretched as well, just as they get stretched in\nthe various map projections shown in the supplement,\n Visualizing Leibniz Equivalence Through Map Projections.\n So the galaxy always remains at the spatial midpoint of the galaxies\non either side; it just doesn\u2019t look like it is at the spatial\nmidpoint from the way the figure is drawn.\n\nSimilarly, an acceleration vector along the galaxy\u2019s worldline\ndetermines whether the galaxy is accelerating. That acceleration\nvector is an invariant. So, if the galaxy in the left hand\ndistribution has a zero acceleration vector, then the corresponding\ngalaxy in the right hand distribution will also have a zero\nacceleration vector. Remember, a hole transformation preserves\ninvariants. So if a galaxy is unaccelerated in the left hand\ndistribution, it is also unaccelerated in the right hand\ndistribution.\n\n(b) Determinism. The physical theory of relativistic\ncosmology is unable to pick between the two cases. This is manifested\nas an indeterminism of the theory. We can specify the distribution of\nmetric and material fields throughout the manifold of events,\nexcepting within the region designated as The Hole. Then the theory is\nunable to tell us how the fields will develop into The Hole. Both the\noriginal and the transformed distribution are legitimate extensions of\nthe metric and matter fields outside The Hole into The Hole, since\neach satisfies all the laws of the theory of relativistic cosmology.\nThe theory has no resources which allow us to insist that one only is\nadmissible.\n\nIt is important to see that the unhappy consequence does not consist\nmerely of a failure of determinism. We are all too familiar with such\nfailures and it is certainly not automatic grounds for dismissal of a\nphysical theory. The best known instance of a widely celebrated,\nindeterministic theory is quantum theory, where, in the standard\ninterpretation, the measurement of a system can lead to an\nindeterministic collapse onto one of many possible outcomes. Less well\nknown is that it is possible to devise indeterministic systems in\nclassical physics as well. Most examples involves oddities such as\nbodies materializing at unbounded speed from spatial infinity, so\ncalled \u201cspace invaders.\u201d (Earman, 1986a, Ch. III; see also\n determinism: causal)\n Or they may arise through the interaction of infinitely many bodies\nin a supertask\n (Supertasks).\n More recently, an extremely simple example has emerged in which a\nsingle mass sits atop a dome and spontaneously sets itself into motion\nafter an arbitrary time delay and in an arbitrary direction (Norton,\n2003, Section 3).\n\nThe problem with the failure of determinism in the hole argument is\nnot the fact of failure but the way that it fails. If we deny manifold\nsubstantivalism and accept Leibniz Equivalence, then the indeterminism\ninduced by a hole transformation is eradicated. While there are\nuncountably many mathematically distinct developments of the fields\ninto the hole, under Leibniz Equivalence, they are all physically the\nsame. That is, there is a unique development of the physical fields\ninto the hole after all. Thus the indeterminism is a direct\nconsequence of the substantivalist\u2019s metaphysical commitments.\nSimilarly, if we accept Leibniz Equivalence, then we are no longer\ntroubled that the two distributions cannot be distinguished by any\npossible observation. They are merely different mathematical\ndescriptions of the same physical reality and so should agree on all\nobservables.\n\nSo, the anti-substantivalist conclusion invited by the hole argument\nis this. We can load up any physical theory with objects or properties\n(here: spacetime events) that cannot be fixed by observation. If their\ninvisibility to observation is not already sufficient warning that\nthese properties are illegitimate, then finding that they visit\nindeterminism onto a theory that is otherwise deterministic ought to\nbe warning enough. Therefore, such objects or properties (again, here\nspacetime events) should be discarded along with any doctrine that\nrequires their retention.\n",
