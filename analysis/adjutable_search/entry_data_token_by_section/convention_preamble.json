    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe central philosophical task posed by conventions is to analyze what\nthey are and how they differ from mere regularities of action and\ncognition. Subsidiary questions include: How do conventions arise? How\nare they sustained? How do we select between alternative conventions?\nWhy should one conform to convention? What social good, if any, do\nconventions serve? How does convention relate to such notions as rule,\nnorm, custom, practice, institution, and social contract? Apart from\nits intrinsic interest, convention is important because philosophers\nfrequently invoke it when discussing other topics. A favorite\nphilosophical gambit is to argue that, perhaps despite appearances to\nthe contrary, some phenomenon ultimately results from convention.\nNotable candidates include: property, government, justice, law,\nmorality, linguistic meaning, necessity, ontology, mathematics, and\nlogic.\n",
