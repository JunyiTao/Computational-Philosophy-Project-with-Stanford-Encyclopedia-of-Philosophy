    "main_text": "Incomparability\n2. Incomparability \n\nRather than focus on commensurability between abstract values, recent\nresearch focuses on the incomparability between concrete bearers of\nvalue, often in the context of choice (Broome 1997, 2000; Chang 1997,\n2002; Griffin 1986; Raz 1986). Bearers of value sometimes appear\nincomparable in cases like Joseph Raz\u2019s example of the choice\nbetween careers (described above in subsection 1.2).\n\nThe case for incomparability in such examples relies in part on what\nRuth Chang calls the \u201cSmall Improvement Argument\u201d (Chang\n2002b, 667). As noted in the initial discussion of the example, if the\nlegal and musical careers were of equal value, then a slightly\nimproved version of the legal career would be better than the musical\ncareer, but this judgment appears incorrect. The Small Improvement\nArgument takes the following general form: \u201cif (1) A is\nneither better nor worse than B (with respect to V),\n(2) A+ is better than A (with respect to\nV), (3) A+ is not better than B (with\nrespect to V), then (4) A and B are not\nrelated by any of the standard trichotomy of relations (relativized to\nV)\u201d where V represents the relevant set of\nconsiderations for purposes of the comparison (Chang 2002b,\n667\u2013668).  In addition to Raz, Derek Parfit and Walter\nSinnott-Armstrong are among those who have advanced the Small\nImprovement Argument (Parfit 1984; Sinnott-Armstrong 1985). A similar\nargument, but for preference relations has, however, a longer\nhistory. Leonard J. Savage hints towards this possibility already\n1954, in 1958 R. Duncan Luce presents a version of the argument that\nhe attributes to Howard Raiffa, and it is also discussed by Ronald de\nSousa in 1974 (Savage 1954; Luce 1958; de Sousa 1974).\n\nFocusing on the incomparability of bearers of value has given rise to\ntwo lines of inquiry in the literature. The first concerns the\nrelation between incomparability and vagueness; some argue that\nalleged examples of incomparability are better understood in terms of\nvagueness. The second concerns the range of comparative relations that\ncan hold between two items; some argue that the Small Improvement\nArgument does not establish incomparability but rather that there are\nmore value relations than previously believed. This section summarizes\ndebate within each line of inquiry.\n",
