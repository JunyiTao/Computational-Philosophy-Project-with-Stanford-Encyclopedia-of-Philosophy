    "main_text": "Ontology and Metaphysics || Criticisms of Transcendental Idealism\n2.1 Criticisms of Transcendental Idealism\n\n\nDespite Ingarden\u2019s deep admiration for Husserl, one crucial issue \u2014\ntranscendental idealism \u2014 divided them. Indeed, Ingarden was already\n\u201ctormented\u201d by the problem for years before he completed\nhis dissertation [\u201cLetter,\u201d 422], and by 1918 had\ndefinitively determined that he could not share Husserl\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism [Streit, vii]. Ingarden\u2019s concern with\nand rejection of transcendental idealism directly or indirectly\ndetermined the course of much of his later philosophical work, so much\nso that in 1961 he describes his process of working on idealism as one\n\u201cwhich has been in fact occupying my entire scholarly\nlife.\u201d [\u201cLetter,\u201d 437].\n\n\nThe transcendental idealism Ingarden rejects is the position that\nthe so-called \u2018real world\u2019 depends on consciousness for its\nexistence and essence; that it exists only for consciousness\nand beyond that is a \u2018nothing\u2019. While there is some debate\namong Husserl scholars over whether or not Husserl genuinely took the\n\u2018turn\u2019 to transcendental idealism in a metaphysical sense\n(as opposed to merely treating it as if it were true while undertaking\nthe methodology of transcendental reduction), Ingarden clearly saw\nHusserl as turning from the realism of the Logical\nInvestigations to a metaphysical form of transcendental idealism\nby the time the first volume of Ideas was published, and the\ntwo frequently debated this topic in letter and in person during the\nperiod from 1918\u20131938.\n\n\nIngarden takes Husserl to have been driven to transcendental\nidealism largely by his epistemological goals and transcendental\napproach to phenomenology. If the very idea of three-dimensional\nexternal objects makes sense, it would be essential that our\nperceptions of them are inevitably inadequate: They may be presented\nfrom one point of view or another, but never exhaustively and entirely\n-- so room is always left open for new perceptions that would lead us\nto entirely revise our past judgments. Such objects thus would\ninherently transcend any finite set of experiences of them; no external\nobject could be part of any experience of it, and any judgments we\nattempt to make about them would be open to doubt. Thus if\nphenomenology is to be a \u2018rigorous science\u2019 grounded only\nin what does not go beyond our experience, it must limit its study to\nobjects of \u2018immanent perception\u2019, the meaningful series of\n(actual and possible) contents of consciousness rather than any\nsupposedly transcendent objects presented by them. Moreover, as Husserl\nargues in \u00a741 of the Cartesian Meditations, since the\ntranscendental ego is the source of all sense, any meaning of\n\u2018transcendent object\u2019 \u2018outside of\nconsciousness\u2019, etc. must be a meaning constructed through\nlayerings of the senses of our conscious acts, and transcendental\nphenomenology can analyze how these meanings are built up out of other\nmeanings of individual acts of perception and intention (e.g. \u2018is\nperceived from this angle\u2019, \u2018could be perceived from\nanother angle, in these other ways\u2019, etc.) This is the meaning\nthat the question e.g. \u2018is this object real?\u2019 may have from\nwithin the standpoint of transcendental phenomenology. Any attempt to\ngo beyond this understanding of \u2018transcendent object\u2019 or\n\u2018real object outside of consciousness\u2019, however, to talk of\nsomething beyond what can be constituted by any actual or possible\nexperience is literally going beyond what can be meaningfully asked; it\nis literally non-sense. The very idea of a world outside of and\nindependent from all actual and possible experience is thus, from this\npoint of view, an illegitimate concept, a kind of disguised nonsense.\nThe only \u2018real world\u2019 of which we can legitimately speak,\nhave knowledge, or enter into other intentional relations with is the\n\u2018real world\u2019 as constituted by, and essentially correlated\nwith, meaningful series\u2019 of intentional acts.\n\n\nIngarden accepted that, as long as we approach the realism problem\nfrom the standpoint of epistemology, or from within the standpoint of\ntranscendental phenomenology, there is no way out to establish the\nexistence and knowledge of a mind-independent world. Nor, however, can\none establish that the real world depends on consciousness, since any\nattempted talk about the world in-itself and its nature would be\nmeaningless \u2014 thus from that standpoint, the controversy over the\nexistence of the world would have to remain undecided. But he also\nthought that other approaches to philosophy were legitimate, and indeed\nthat one should begin from ontology rather than epistemology.\n\n\nAccording to Ingarden, the realism/idealism problem is fundamentally\na metaphysical problem (about the actual existence of the so-called\n\u2018real\u2019 world and its relation to consciousness), but may be\nnon-circularly approached via ontology by examining what the possible\nsorts of relation between consciousness and the world could be. In\nparticular, Ingarden hoped that an ontological approach to the\nrealism/idealism problem could lead to a solution by attempting to\nidentify what the possible modes of being would be of the\n\u2018real\u2019 world and of consciousness, and how the two could\npossibly be related. This was the motive for his monumental work in\nontology, The Controversy over the Existence of the World,\ndesigned to describe the different possible modes of being and their\npossible interrelations, with a view to narrowing down possible\nsolutions to the realism/idealism problem. Unfortunately, the work was\nnever fully completed (although the first two volumes were published\nand the third in progress at the time of Ingarden\u2019s death), but the\nportions that exist nonetheless contain many important and detailed\nontological analyses valuable in their own right as well as having the\npotential to contribute to the discussion of the realism/idealism\ncontroversy. Prominent among these is his distinction between formal,\nmaterial, and existential ontologies, and distinguishing \u2018modes\nof being\u2019 as highest existential categories.\n",
