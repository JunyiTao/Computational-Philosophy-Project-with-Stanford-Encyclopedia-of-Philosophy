    "main_text": "Self-Location in Decision Theory and Formal Epistemology\n7. Objections\n\nThe positive accounts concerning self-locating belief we\u2019ve\ndescribed above (Lewis\u2019 and Perry\u2019s, the accounts of\ncommunication, the accounts of updating, etc.) each face their own\nspecific objections and challenges. Here, however, we take up\nobjections to the main argumentative thread pursued in this piece:\nthat cases of ignorance, similarity, and difference require us to\nrecognize a distinctive category of self-locating belief.\n\nWe have assessed this as a thesis in the philosophy of mind. Yet\nit\u2019s easy for this thesis to become conflated with various\ntheses in the philosophy of language, and thus for arguments against\nthe need for special linguistic constructions to express self-locating\nattitudes to be mistaken for arguments that such attitudes don\u2019t\nexist to begin with. (Here it doesn\u2019t help that many of\nPerry\u2019s key examples appear in the course of his argument for an\n\u201cessential indexical\u201d.)\n\nMillikan (1990), for instance, argues that self-locating attitudes\n(doxastic or otherwise) could exist without the presence of indexicals\nin either communicative language or the language of thought (if there\nbe such). She imagines creatures, each of whom has a special name for\nthemselves\u2014a name employed in all and only their self-locating\nthoughts and expressions. For instance, John might employ the name\n\u201cJP\u201d whenever he thinks or speaks a self-locating thought\nabout himself, and never otherwise; while David might use\n\u201cDL\u201d, etc. We can imagine that these creatures\u2019\nlanguage entirely lacks expressions whose characters shift across\ncontexts (in the sense of Kaplan 1989).\n\nIf Millikan is right that such creatures could exist, then it seems\nthe cases of ignorance, similarity, and difference we\u2019ve\nidentified could perhaps occur without necessitating any indexicals,\nused either among the actors in the examples or among the theorists\ndescribing the cases. Notice, however, that this is not an argument\nagainst the existence of self-locating attitudes; it is simply an\nargument that self-locating attitudes could exist without the\nattendant presence of indexicals.\n\nSimilarly, a number of authors have argued that the cases that seem to\ncall for self-locating beliefs are \u201cjust Frege cases\u201d\n(Millikan 1990: 730; Devitt 2013; Magidor 2015; and especially\nCappelen & Dever 2013). Cappelen and Dever offer the following\nparallel case to Perry\u2019s messy shopper:\n\n\nPushing my cart down the aisle I was looking for CK to tell him he was\nmaking a mess. I kept passing by Superman, but couldn\u2019t find CK.\nFinally, I realized, Superman was CK. I believed at the outset that CK\nwas making a mess. And I was right. But I didn\u2019t believe that\nSuperman was making a mess. That seems to be something that I came to\nbelieve. And when I came to believe that, I stopped looking around and\nI told Superman to clean up after himself. My change in beliefs seems\nto explain my change in behavior. (Cappelen & Dever 2013: 33)\n\n\nThe objection seems to be that the motivating cases for self-locating\nbelief don\u2019t do anything new; they don\u2019t highlight any\nphenomena we shouldn\u2019t already have been aware of from decades\nof study of Frege\u2019s puzzle. We know from that puzzle that our\ntheory of content needs to accommodate multiple ways of referring to\nthe same object, and that cases of ignorance, similarity, and\ndifference can arise from such multiplicity. While there are plenty of\ndebates about which theory of propositions handles this puzzle best,\nyour preferred mechanism for solving that puzzle should equally well\nhandle the motivating cases above\u2014or so the objection goes.\n\nThis line might succeed as an objection against the claim that cases\nof self-location require us to modify our theory of propositions (as,\nfor instance, Lewis suggests). Perhaps if we had a theory of\npropositions that successfully handled Frege puzzles, it would apply\nmutatis mutandis to these cases as well. (Though see Shaw\n2019 for a denial of this concession.) But that is no argument against\nthe existence of a distinctive category of self-locating beliefs.\n\nTo see why, let\u2019s focus on one theory of propositions that\npurports to address Frege cases (a similar point could be made on any\nother such theory). Imagine that propositions are Russellian, but are\nbelieved under guises. So I might believe de re of someone\nthat their pants are on fire, and also see on a Zoom call that\nsomeone\u2019s pants are on fire. If the person about whom I have the\nde re belief is also the unfortunate Zooming individual, then\nI believe the same proposition under two guises\u2014one de\nre and one descriptive (with the relevant description being\nsomething like the guy on Zoom).\n\nPut in terms of guise theory, the cases of ignorance, similarity, and\ndifference seem to show that there exists a distinctive category of\nattitudes whose propositional contents are not believed under de\nre or descriptive guises. When Perry realizes that he is the one\nmaking a mess, he does not come to believe the proposition that Perry\nis making a mess under the guise that John Perry is making a\nmess, nor does he come to believe that proposition under the\nde re guise that that guy is making a mess. To\naccount for Perry\u2019s new doxastic state, we need to recognize a\ndistinctive type of belief that is not a state of believing a\nproposition under a descriptive or de re guise. We can\nconcede that self-locating beliefs are still beliefs in propositions\nunder guises, understood as guise theory wants to understand them in\nits proposed response to Frege puzzles. But that does not keep them\nfrom being a distinctive category of beliefs.\n\nCappelen and Dever do, however, offer a distinct line of attack that\nbears directly on the existence of self-locating doxastic states.\n(Their attack builds upon suggestions in Magidor 2015.) Many of our\ncases of ignorance, similarity, and difference cite as evidence for\nthe presence of significant self-locating beliefs an action performed\nby an agent. That Perry has resolved his ignorance about the identity\nof the messy shopper is indicated by his rearranging a sack; the\ndifference between my taking my own pants to be on fire and my\nfriend\u2019s taking my pants to be aflame is indicated by my\ndropping to the ground and rolling around; etc. In each case, it is\neventually argued that these actions cannot be entirely explained by\ndescriptive or de re cognitive states, and thus that we need\nto attribute self-locating beliefs to the agents in question in order\nexplain their actions. More generally, there is a consistent\nsuggestion across the self-location literature that self-locating\ncognitive states play a central, and crucial, role in action\nexplanation.\n\nCappelen and Dever deny that self-locating doxastic states play any\nrole in action explanation, hoping to thwart some of the main\nmotivating cases for asserting that such doxastic states exist. They\nbegin by asking us to imagine a god whose doxastic states are all of\nthe type envisioned by the Simple Picture\u2014binary relations\nbetween the believer and objects of belief that are traditional\npropositions. This god\n\n\ncan bring about states of the world just by intending them or maybe\njust by thinking them. The god thinks, \u201cThe door is\nclosed\u201d, and straightaway the door is closed. (2013: 37)\n\n\nIt seems this god could perform all sorts of\nactions\u2014intentionally bring about all sorts of states of\naffairs\u2014without having any self-locating representations at\nall.\n\nYet the actions of non-omnipotents are a bit more difficult to\nexplain. Why, when my friend and I both realize my pants are aflame,\ndo I but not he drop to the ground and roll? Cappelen and Dever deny\nthat this is because I possess some special self-representing\ncognitive state that my friend lacks. They trace the difference in\naction not to a difference in belief or desire, but instead to a\ndifference in ability. Both my friend and I believe that Mike\u2019s\npants are aflame, and both of us desire that Mike drop to the ground\nand roll around. But Mike has the ability to make that happen, while\nAndy lacks that ability (at least directly\u2014Andy can do things\nlike shout at Mike in an effort to induce dropping and rolling); so\nMike does it and Andy doesn\u2019t. Cappelen and Dever suggest that\none can explain all the differences in action here without invoking\nself-locating self-representations at any point.\n\nOne might be dubious that such an explanatory strategy can be\nsuccessfully executed all the way through\u2014can we really tell the\nwhole story of an action without invoking self-locating\nrepresentation at any stage? Will this work across all examples of\nhuman action, and all action descriptions we might be inclined to use?\n(See Torre 2018 and Ninan 2016 for doubts on each front.)\nThere\u2019s also a tricky question here about argumentative burdens,\nand what\u2019s required to discharge them. Suppose it\u2019s\ngranted that there could be agents\u2014like Cappelen and\nDever\u2019s god\u2014who performed intentional actions without\npossessing any self-locating doxastic attitudes. One might still\nmaintain that real-life humans employ self-locating representations in\ntheir practical deliberations, and perhaps that we are wired up so as\nto be incapable of intentionally acting without invoking self-locating\nattitudes. (Indexicals might not be essential for\nall agents, but self-locating attitudes might be\nessential for us.)\n\nIs this an empirical question about human agential psychology? (And\nare there interesting, related questions about animals and infants?)\nOr could we argue for self-locating attitudes on the grounds that\nincluding them in our theory of mind makes that theory simpler, more\nunified, and more fruitful? When we look not just at immediate action\ngeneration, but across the whole spectrum of an agent\u2019s\npractical deliberation\u2014her hopes, plans, goals, and\naspirations\u2014there certainly seems to be a disproportionate focus\non how events affect one particular individual, and what that\nindividual is capable of. The various motivational stories we\u2019ve\ncited suggest that that individual\u2019s experiences and abilities\nfactor into her cognitive architecture in ways that others\u2019\nexperiences and abilities don\u2019t (or don\u2019t nearly as\nfrequently), and in ways that explain her actions without explaining\nthe actions of others (or explaining them in the same way). Perhaps\ntheories of mind are possible that account for all these patterns of\nsimilarity and difference without postulating self-locating beliefs.\nBut it may also be that theories of self-locating belief are the best\nexplanations of these phenomena currently on offer.\n",
