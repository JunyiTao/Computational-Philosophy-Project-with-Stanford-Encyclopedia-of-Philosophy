    "main_text": "Systemic Evil\n5. Systemic Evil\n\nSystemic evil is the kind of evil that exists at the level of\nsystems or groups rather than merely at the level of individuals.\nOrganized structures like governments, corporations, teams, and\nreligious institutions can be evil in this way; so can more\nloosely-organized systems such as \u201cAcademia\u201d, \u201cWhite\nSupremacy\u201d, and \u201cWall Street\u201d. Indeed, Google\nincludes the motto \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d in\nits Company Code of Conduct (for the origins of this, see\nChang 2019); disgruntled employees later sued the company alleging\nthat it had violated that pledge (Allyn 2021).\n\nSystemic evil seems empirical rather than metaphysical, but its\norigins are difficult to identify. It does not appear to be a merely\nnatural phenomenon, or a spooky non-agential one, and yet its\nsupra-agential character makes it seem not entirely moral either.\n\nHannah Arendt\u2019s early work on totalitarianism (1951) depicts\nsystemic evil as a kind of empirical evil for which no\nindividual or even collection of individuals is fully responsible. The\ncogs in the machine, as well as the leader or leadership, may be the\norigin of some of the harms involved, but the evil of the whole\nstructure (on Arendt\u2019s view) is somehow greater than the sum\nproduced by its parts.\n\nRacism is another prominent example of systemic evil. Recent accounts\nof entrenched racist structures in certain societies (the United\nStates, for instance) suggest that such evil has its origin not merely\nin actions and intentions but also in omissions and\npassivity: people who do not explicitly support the\nsystemic evil can count as agents of it. If this is right, then active\nwork against the evil in question\u2014\u201canti-racist\u201d\nactivity rather than \u201cnon-racist\u201d activity, for\nexample\u2014becomes morally required (Kendi 2019). But even such\nactive opposition efforts may not be sufficient to avoid complicity in\nsystemic evil: some theorists argue that even anti-racist people\nliving in racist societies are \u201ctainted\u201d by its evil all\nthe same (Rothstein 2017). That leads to the next kind of problem\ncase.\n",
