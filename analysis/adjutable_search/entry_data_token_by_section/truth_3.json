    "main_text": "The neo-classical theories of truth || Pragmatist theories\n1.3 Pragmatist theories\n\nA different perspective on truth was offered by the American\npragmatists. As with the neo-classical correspondence and coherence\ntheories, the pragmatist theories go with some typical slogans. For\nexample, Peirce is usually understood as holding the view that:\n\nTruth is the end of inquiry.\n\n\n(See, for instance Hartshorne et al., 1931\u201358, \u00a73.432.)\nBoth Peirce and James are associated with the slogan that:\n\nTruth is satisfactory to believe.\n\n\nJames (e.g., 1907) understands this principle as telling us what\npractical value truth has. True beliefs are guaranteed not to conflict\nwith subsequent experience. Likewise, Peirce\u2019s slogan tells us\nthat true beliefs will remain settled at the end of prolonged inquiry.\nPeirce\u2019s slogan is perhaps most typically associated with\npragmatist views of truth, so we might take it to be our canonical\nneo-classical theory. However, the contemporary literature does not\nseem to have firmly settled upon a received\n\u2018neo-classical\u2019 pragmatist theory.\n\nIn her reconstruction (upon which we have relied heavily), Haack\n(1976) notes that the pragmatists\u2019 views on truth also make room\nfor the idea that truth involves a kind of correspondence, insofar as\nthe scientific method of inquiry is answerable to some independent\nworld. Peirce, for instance, does not reject a correspondence theory\noutright; rather, he complains that it provides merely a\n\u2018nominal\u2019 or \u2018transcendental\u2019 definition of\ntruth (e.g Hartshorne et al., 1931\u201358, \u00a75.553,\n\u00a75.572), which is cut off from practical matters of experience,\nbelief, and doubt (\u00a75.416). (See Misak (2004) for an extended\ndiscussion.)\n\nThis marks an important difference between the pragmatist theories and\nthe coherence theory we just considered. Even so, pragmatist theories\nalso have an affinity with coherence theories, insofar as we expect\nthe end of inquiry to be a coherent system of beliefs. As Haack also\nnotes, James maintains an important verificationist idea: truth is\nwhat is verifiable. We will see this idea re-appear in section 4.\n\nFor more on pragmatist theories of truth, see Misak (2018).\nJames\u2019 views are discussed further in the entry on\n William James.\n Peirce\u2019s views are discussed further in the entry on\n Charles Sanders Peirce.\n",
