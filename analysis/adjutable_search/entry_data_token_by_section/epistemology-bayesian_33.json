    "main_text": "The Problem of Idealization || Applications Empowered by Idealization\n6.3 Applications Empowered by Idealization\n\nThere is a third approach to the problem of idealization: to some\nBayesians, some aspects of the Bayesian idealization are to be\nutilized rather than removed, because it is those aspects of\nidealization that empower certain important applications of\nBayesian epistemology in science. Here is the idea. Consider a human\nscientist confronted with an empirical problem. When some hypotheses\nhave been stated for consideration and some data have been collected,\nthere remains an inferential task\u2014the task of inferring from the\ndata to one of the hypotheses. This inferential task can be done by\nhuman scientists alone, but it has been done increasingly often this\nway: by developing a computer program (in Bayesian statistics) to\nsimulate an idealized Bayesian agent as if that agent were hired to\nperform the inferential task. The purpose of this inferential task\nwould be undermined if what is simulated by the computer were a\ncognitively underpowered agent who mimics the limited capacities of\nhuman agents. Howson (1992: sec. 6) suggests that this inferential\ntask is what Bayesian epistemology and Bayesian statistics were mainly\ndesigned for at the early stages of their development. See Fienberg\n(2006) for the historical development of Bayesian statistics.\n\nSo, on the above view, idealization is essential to the existing\napplications of Bayesian epistemology in science. If so, the real\nissue is whether the kind of scientific inquiry empowered by\nBayesian idealization serves the purpose of the inferential task\nbetter than do the non-Bayesian rivals, such as so-called\nfrequentism and likelihoodism in statistics. For a\ncritical comparison of those three schools of thought about\nstatistical inference, see Sober (2008: ch. 1), Hacking (2016), and\nthe entry on\n philosophy of statistics.\n For an introduction to both Bayesian statistics and frequentist\nstatistics written for philosophers, see Howson & Urbach (2006:\nch. 5\u20138).\n\n\n",
