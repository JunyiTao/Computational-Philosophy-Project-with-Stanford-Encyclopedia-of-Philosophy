Complex names also occur\nin sentences, as the expressions \u2018part of \\(A\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018ingredient of \\(A\\)\u2019 in \u2018every part of\n\\(A\\) is an ingredient of \\(A\\)\u2019. Le\u015bniewski had\nhitherto taken such logical bits of language for granted, but now he\nneeded to formalize them. He wanted a logical calculus of names and the\nexpressions involving them. There were precedents in traditional\nsyllogistic, and more especially in the algebra of logic of Ernst\nSchr\u00f6der, which Le\u015bniewski looked at in coming up with his\nown system, based as in the case of Mereology on his intuitive\nunderstanding of the relevant expressions as carefully used in ordinary\nlanguage. At first he gathered propositions he was sure were true, such\nas \u2018If \\(A\\) is \\(b\\), then \\(A\\) is\n\\(A\\)\u2019. We know about this one because it is mentioned,\npresumably scornfully, in a diary entry by Twardowski for 1 July 1919,\nas being the first axiom of the new system that Le\u015bniewski was\nworking on at the time. Le\u015bniewski has left us a graphic\ndescription of his method of working at this crucial and fluid time of\nhis development [Collected Works 366\u20139]:\n\n \nWhile using colloquial language in scientific work and attempting to\ncontrol its \u2018logic\u2019, I endeavoured to somehow rationalize\nthe way in which I was using in colloquial language various types of\npropositions passed down to us by \u2018traditional logic\u2019.\nWhile relying on \u2018linguistic instinct\u2019 and the often\nnon-uniform tradition of \u2018traditional logic\u2019, I attempted\nto devise a consistent method of working with propositions that were\n\u2018singular\u2019, \u2018particular\u2019,\n\u2018general\u2019, \u2018existential\u2019 etc. The results of my\nefforts were useful and I continued my efforts in applying to the\n\u2018symbolism\u2019 the equivalents of various types of\npropositions, after the change to the \u2018symbolic\u2019 way of\nwriting.\n\n \nWhile working in this way, and attempting to define some expressions\nin terms of others, Le\u015bniewski came to focus on singular\npropositions of the form \u2018\\(A\\) is (a) \\(b\\)\u2019,\nwhich he henceforth wrote as \u2018\\(A \\isa b\\)\u2019, borrowing from Peano the lower-case epsilon, the\nfirst letter of the Greek \u2018\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u2019,\nis. It was this connection with meanings of \u2018is\u2019\nthat prompted Le\u015bniewski to name this system\n\u2018Ontology\u2019. He thought it would be possible to base it on\nsingular inclusions like \u2018\\(A \\isa b\\)\u2019\nalone, in addition to concepts taken from the logic of connectives and\nquantifiers. The key thought was that the following should be true\n\n \\(A\\) is \\(a\\) if and only if (every \\(A\\) is\n\\(a\\), and at most one object is \\(A)\\)\n \n\n \nThis requires the two expressions \u2018every \\(A\\) is\n\\(a\\)\u2019 and \u2018at most one object is \\(A\\)\u2019 to\nbe defined. The first can be helped along by\n\n every \\(a\\) is \\(b\\) if and only if (some object is\n\\(a\\), and for any \\(X\\), if \\(X\\) is \\(a\\), then\n\\(X\\) is \\(b)\\)\n \n\n \nwhich requires \u2018some\u2019 and \u2018object\u2019 to be\ndefined: they can be helped further by\n\n\n some \\(a\\) is \\(b\\) if and only if for some \\(X,\nX\\) is \\(a\\) and \\(X\\) is \\(b\\)\n\n if \\(A\\) is \\(b\\), then \\(A\\) is an object\n\n\n \nwhile the second can be helped by\n\n at most one object is \\(a\\) if and only if for any \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), if \\(A\\) is \\(a\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(a\\),\nthen \\(A\\) is the same object as \\(B\\)\n \n\n \nand finally we have\n\n \\(A\\) is the same object as \\(B\\) if and only if \\((A\\)\nis \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(A)\\).\n \n\n \nPutting these together, and inspired by Russell\u2019s theory of\ndefinite descriptions, Le\u015bniewski arrived in 1920 at a single\naxiom based on the single primitive \u2018is\u2019:\n\n \n\\(A\\) is \\(a\\) if and only if ((for some \\(B,\nB\\) is \\(A)\\) and (for any \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), if\n\\(B\\) is \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) is \\(A\\), then \\(B\\)\nis \\(C)\\), and (for any \\(B\\), if \\(B\\) is \\(A\\)\nthen \\(B\\) is \\(a))\\)\n \n\n \nThe story has it that Le\u015bniewski discovered this axiom, his\nefforts fortified by eating bars of chocolate, while sitting on a bench\nin Warsaw\u2019s Saxon Garden. Symbolically, using a somewhat more\nmodern symbolism than Le\u015bniewski\u2019s, but borrowing his upper\ncorners for marking quantifier scope, the axiom becomes\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{OL} \n\\forall Aa\\ulcorner A \\isa a \\leftrightarrow (&\\exists B \\ulcorner B \\isa A\\urcorner \\\\\n&\\wedge \\forall BC \\ulcorner(B \\isa A \\wedge C \\isa A) \\rightarrow B \\isa C\\urcorner \\\\\n&\\wedge \\forall B \\ulcorner B \\isa A \\rightarrow B \\isa a\\urcorner)\\urcorner\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n \nSeveral things are notable about this axiom and its formulation. It is\nin the form of a universally quantified equivalence, with the\nright-hand side as it were explicating the left-hand side, so that it\nis a kind of implicit definition of the primitive\n\u2018\\(\\isa\\)\u2019. The right-hand side, taking its cue from\nRussell, says that there is at least one \\(A\\) (first conjunct),\nthere is at most one \\(A\\) (second conjunct), and any \\(A\\)\nis an \\(a\\) (third conjunct). The use of capital letter variables\nis an informal aid to perspicuity: they mark the positions in\nsentences (especially before \u2018\\(\\isa\\)\u2019) where a variable\ncan only yield a truth of its immediate context if it is\nsingular. Where small Italic variables are used, there is no such\npresumption of singularity. In principle only one typeface of\nvariables is needed. On the basis of his axiom and several rules of\ninference, Le\u015bniewski developed a powerful system of general\nlogic comparable in strength to a simple type theory: he writes in\n1929, \u201cIn 1921 I developed my \u2018theory of types\u2019\n[\u2026] It was something like Whitehead\u2019s and Russell\u2019s theory of\ntypes, which I had generalised and simplified in a certain way\u201d\n(Collected Works, 421). \n",
