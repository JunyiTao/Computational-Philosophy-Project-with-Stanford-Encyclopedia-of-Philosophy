    "main_text": "Entrenchment\n3. Entrenchment\n\nAccording to most theorists, another important feature of\nconstitutionalism is that the norms imposing limits upon government\npower must be in some way, and to some degree, be entrenched,\neither legally or by way of constitutional\n convention.[7]\n In other words, those whose powers are constitutionally\nlimited\u2014i.e., the institutions of government\u2014must not be\nconstitutionally at liberty to change or expunge those limits at their\npleasure. Most written constitutions contain amending formulae which\ncan be triggered by, and require the participation of, the government\nbodies whose powers they limit. But these formulae invariably require\nsomething more than a simple decision on the part of the present\ngovernment, through e.g., Presidential fiat or simple majority vote in\nthe legislature, to invoke a change. Sometimes constitutional\nassemblies are required, or super-majority votes, referendums, or the\nagreement of not only the central government in a federal system but\nalso some number or percentage of the governments or regional units\nwithin the federal\n system.[8]\n Entrenchment not only facilitates a degree of stability and\npredictability over time (a characteristic aspiration of\nconstitutional regimes), it is arguably a requirement of the very\npossibility of constitutionally limited government. Were a\ngovernment institution entitled, at its pleasure, to change the very\nterms of its constitutional limitations, we might begin to question\nwhether there would, in reality, be any such limitations. Consider\nRegina once again. Were she entitled, at her discretion, to remove\n(and perhaps later reinstate) the constitutional restriction\npreventing her from legislating on some religious matter on which she\nhad strong views, then it is perhaps questionable whether Regina could\nsensibly be said to be bound by this\n requirement.[9]\n On the other hand, were there a constitutional rule or convention\nspecifying that Regina is entitled to remove this restriction only if\nshe succeeds in convincing two thirds of her subjects to vote for the\nchange, then one might feel more comfortable speaking of\nconstitutional limitation. Of course this constitutional meta-rule or\nconvention is itself subject to change or elimination\u2014a fact\nthat raises a host of further puzzles. For example, does such an act\nrequire application of the very rule in question\u2014i.e., two\nthird\u2019s majority vote\u2014or are the sovereign people of\nRegina\u2019s society at liberty to change or expunge it at\ntheir pleasure? If we accept (a) the distinction between\ngovernment and sovereignty urged above; (b) that ultimate sovereignty\nresides in the people whom Regina governs; and (c) that sovereignty\ncannot be self-limiting, (X cannot limit X) then we\nmight sensibly be led to conclude that the constitutional\nmeta-rule\u2014and hence the constitutional regime of which it is an\nintegral part\u2014both exist at the pleasure of the general\npopulation of Regina\u2019s society. Entrenchment may be an essential\nelement of constitutional regimes, but it would seem that\nconstitutions neither can nor should be entrenched against the actions\nof a sovereign people.\n",
