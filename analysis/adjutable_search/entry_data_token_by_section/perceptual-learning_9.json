    "main_text": "Varieties of Perceptual Learning || Attentional Weighting\n2.3 Attentional Weighting\n\nIn attentional weighting, through practice or experience people come\nto systematically attend toward certain objects and properties and\naway from other objects and properties. Paradigm cases of attentional\nweighting have been shown in sports studies, where it has been found,\nfor instance, that expert fencers attend more to their\nopponents\u2019 upper trunk area, while non-experts attend more to\ntheir opponents\u2019 upper leg area (Hagemann et al., 2010). Practice or experience\nmodulates attention as fencers learn, shifting it towards certain\nareas and away from other areas.\n\nIn the case of the expert fencer, a shift in the weight of attention\nto the opponents\u2019 upper trunk area facilitates the\nexpert\u2019s fencing skills. However, shifts in attentional\nweighting can also fail to facilitate skills or even stifle them. For\nexample, a new golfer with inadequate coaching might develop the bad\nhabit of attending to their putter while putting, rather than learning\nto keep their \u201ceye on the ball.\u201d This unhelpful shift in\nattentional weighting may well stifle the new golfer\u2019s ability\nto become a skillful putter.\n\nOne way to understand weighted attention is as attention that has\nbecome automatic with respect to particular properties. In\nother words, when the expert fencer attends to the upper trunk area,\nthis attention is no longer governed by her intention (see Wu 2014:\n33, for more on this account of automaticity). Rather, as the result\nof practice, the expert fencer\u2019s attention is now automatic\nwith respect to the trunk area. This italicized part is\nimportant. On Wayne Wu\u2019s account of attention, for instance, one\nmight ask whether attention is automatic with respect to different\nfeatures of the process of attention: \u201cwhere attention is\ndirected and in what sequence, how long it is sustained, to what\nspecific features in the scene, and so on\u201d (p. 34). In the case\nof the expert fencer, plausibly her attention is automatic with\nrespect to the trunk area, even if it is not automatic in other\nrespects. This automaticity is the product of her learning\nprocess.\n",
