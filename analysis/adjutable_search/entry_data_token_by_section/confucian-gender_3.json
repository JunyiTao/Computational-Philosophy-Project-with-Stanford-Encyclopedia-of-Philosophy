    "main_text": "Nei-wai \u5167\u5916 and Gendered Differentiation || Nei-wai as Gendered Spheres\n3.1 Nei-wai as Gendered Spheres\n\nRitual differentiation gives rise to role differentiation, and among\nthem, gender role differentiation (nann\u00fc zhibie\n\u7537\u5973\u4e4b\u5225 or fufu youbie\n\u592b\u5a66\u6709\u5225) is foundational. As it is said in\nthe Book of Rites (Liji),\n\n\nFrom the distinction between man and woman came the righteousness\nbetween husband and wife. From the righteousness between husband and\nwife came the affection between father and son. From the affection\nbetween father and son came the rectitude between ruler and minster.\nHence it is said, \u201cThe marriage rite is the root of other ritual\nobservances\u201d. (Liji, \u201cHunyi\u201d\nchapter; for other translations see Legge 1885)\n\n\nGender role differentiation, in turn, is marked along the spatial\nbinary of inside-outside (nei-wai \u5167\u5916).\nAccording to the Book of Changes (Yijing),\n\n\nIn the Family (Jiaren \u5bb6\u4eba) hexagram, a\nwoman\u2019s correct place is in the nei and man in the\nwai, that men and women occupy their correct places is the\ngreat righteousness of heaven and earth [\u2026] Let the father be\nthe father, the son son, the brothers brothers, the husband husband,\nthe wife wife, then the way of family will be correct; when the family\nis correct then the world will be secured. (Yijing,\n\u201cJiaren\u201d hexagram,\n\u201cTuanzhuan\u201d commentary; for other translations\nsee Legge 1882)\n\n\nGender role differentiation corresponding to the spatial binary of\nnei-wai, hence, lays the groundwork for all other\nhuman relations\u2014be familial or political\u2014to follow.\n\nThe nei-wai binary - much like the yin-yang binary -\nis correlative, overlapping, as well as cross- and beyond-gender. But\nunlike the cosmic concept of yin-yang, nei-wai is\nprimarily a spatial concept demarcating both ritual and physical\nboundaries. This inside-outside spatial demarcation doesn\u2019t mean\nthat nei is inferior to wai. On the contrary,\nnei is the focused center on which one anchors in order to\nproceed to or retract from the wai. Even though the\nnei-wai spatial boundary is ever shifting and overlapping\ndepending on one\u2019s proximity to the focused center (Yu 1986; Ko\n1994; Ames 1994; Hay 1994), whatever counts as nei is\nnecessarily and invariably encircled by the expansive sphere of\nwai. The sphere of nei is necessarily and invariably\na defined inside marking whatever outside of it as wai.\nHence, the spatial concept of nei-wai, when it is coupled\nwith gender role differentiation, draws a much more restrictive\nsphere\u2014both ritually and physically\u2014for women compared to\na more expansive sphere for men where advanced literary learning,\nnon-familial roles, and service to the wider world including\nofficialdom are located.\n\nAccording to the Book of Songs (Shijing), the gender\nmarking of nei-wai signifying the spheres of domesticity and\nofficialdom respectively begins as soon as a child is born: a boy is\nclothed in robes, placed on couches to sleep and given [official]\nscepters to play with, whereas a girl is clothed in wraps, laid on the\nground to sleep, and given [weaving] tiles to play with\n(Shijing, Song 189 \u201cSigan\u201d; for other\ntranslations see Legge 1876). Similarly, in the Liji, the\nbirth of a boy is signaled by placing a bow (i.e., archery as one of\nthe six arts in the Confucian educational curriculum for men) on the\nleft side of the door, whereas a girl\u2019s birth is marked by a\nhandkerchief (i.e., weaving/embroidering as part of women\u2019s work\nin the four womanly virtues, side \u56db\u5fb7) on the\nright side of the door. Children are to begin their self-conscious\nembodiment of these gender roles at age seven when boys and girls\ncease to sit together nor eat together on the same mat, and at age\nten, their educational curricula begin to diverge widely: a boy is to\nventure out seeking worthy mentors to broaden his education befitting\nhis anticipated expansive responsibilities both as a husband and as a\nscholar-knight (shi \u58eb), whereas a girl is engaged in\nhomebound training for an enclosed, domestic life befitting her\nanticipated role as a congenial, pleasant, understanding, and\ncompliant wife (Liji, \u201cNeize\u201d\nchapter).\n",
