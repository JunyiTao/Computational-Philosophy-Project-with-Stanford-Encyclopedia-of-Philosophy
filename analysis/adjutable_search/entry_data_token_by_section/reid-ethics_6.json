    "main_text": "Moral Principles || Reid\u2019s defense of the objectivity of moral first principles\n3.1 Reid\u2019s defense of the objectivity of moral first principles\n\nSo far, then, we have a sense of what, according to Reid, the first\nprinciples of morality are and the roles that Reid wished them to\nplay. What should be added is that Reid thinks them to be objective in\na fairly strong sense. Or to put things somewhat more guardedly, if we\ninterpret Reid\u2019s claims that motives do not exist to mean only\nthat they do not exist in space/time, then Reid thinks they are\nobjective in a fairly robust sense (for different interpretations, see\nDavid 1985, Nichols 2002, Yaffe 2004, and Van Cleve 2015, ch. 10).\n\nIn the first place, Reid believes that the fundamental moral\nprinciples cannot be the product of convention. His argument in this\ncase is directed against Hume. In Reid\u2019s view, Hume defends a\nconventionalist account of justice, which rides on a quasi-genetic\naccount of the emergence of the norms of justice. According to\nHume\u2019s story, we begin with a notion of our good on the whole.\nOut of a concern to secure our good on the whole, we create the rules\nof justice by convention. In response, Reid notes that to have the\nconcept of one\u2019s good on the whole, one must also have the\nconcepts of \u2018being a favor\u2019 and \u2018being an\ninjury.\u2019 These concepts, however, are \u201cearly in the mind\nof man as any rational notion whatever\u201d (EAP V.v: 309). Reid\ncontends that Hume would seem also to be committed to as much. Hume,\nafter all, believes gratitude and resentment to be\n\u201cnatural\u201d sentiments that are concerned with favors and\ninjuries. Call those concepts that cluster around the notion of\njustice, such as \u2018being wronged,\u2019 \u2018being what is\ndeserved,\u2019 and \u2018being that to which one is\nentitled,\u2019 our concepts of primary justice. Reid argues\nthat Hume\u2019s quasi-genetic story faces a problem, for a person\ncannot have the concepts \u2018being a favor\u2019 and \u2018being\nan injury\u2019 without first having the concepts of primary\njustice.\n\nConsider favors. Favors, says Reid, are naturally connected with the\nbenevolent affection of gratitude; they are what merit this response.\nBut to express gratitude toward someone who has performed a favor is\nto believe or presuppose that that agent has benefited you by going\nbeyond what is owed. Or consider being injured (as opposed to simply\nbeing harmed). Being injured, says Reid, is naturally connected with\nthe malevolent affection of resentment. To express resentment toward\nan agent who has injured you is, however, to believe or presuppose\nthat he has wronged you, given you less than you deserve. If this is\nright, we do not derive the primary concepts of justice from an\ninterest to secure our good on the whole. To the contrary, the reverse\nis true; we can arrive at a notion of our own good on the whole only\nif we possess the concepts of primary justice. But if so, we cannot\nhold that we somehow constructed our notions and the rules of justice\nfrom a concern to secure our good on the whole. Our notion of our good\non the whole presupposes them (see Cuneo 2015 and Powell and Yaffe\n2015).\n\nIn fact, Reid believes that reflection on our concepts of primary\njustice reveals more than this. It also reveals that these concepts\nare irreducible to other normative concepts and fundamental to moral\nthinking. Reid\u2019s way of making this point is to note that Hume\nattempts to ground the rules of justice not just in our notion of our\ngood on the whole, but also in considerations of utility. Reid holds\nthat this is a mistake. To \u201chave the conception of\njustice,\u201d it is necessary that \u201cone perceive its\nobligation distinct from its utility\u201d (EAP V.v: 306).\nConsiderations of utility, Reid holds, are the wrong sort of reasons\nto ground accountability relations, which are among the objects of our\nconcepts of primary justice. In his book, The Second-Person\nStandpoint, Stephen Darwall puts the point like this: To see that\nsomething is required of another is to take up the\n\u201csecond-person standpoint\u201d with regard to him. To occupy\nthis standpoint is to have the authority to hold that person\naccountable for not doing what is required of him. Failure to perform\nan act that increases utility, however, is not the right sort of thing\nfor which to hold someone accountable (see Darwall 2006, especially\nthe discussion of Reid in Ch. 8; see also Wolterstorff 2010).\n\nIn addition to rejecting moral constructivist accounts of justice,\nReid rejects what we today would call response-dependent accounts of\nmoral facts. Roughly put, response-dependent views, which Reid\nattributes to sentimentalists such as Hutcheson and Hume, maintain\nthat moral reality is determined by the sorts of affective reactions\nwe have to the world. It is because certain actions and events elicit\ncertain types of affective states in us that they have properties such\nas being wrong or being obligatory. Drawing upon\nwhat rationalists such as Balguy and Price had argued, Reid asks us to\nconsider fundamental moral principles, such as the claim that, in\nordinary conditions, an agent ought to honor his promise. Claims such\nas this, Reid says, are necessarily true. But if the\nresponse-dependent view were correct, it is difficult to see how that\ncould be so. After all, we can imagine being constituted in such a way\nthat we failed to disapprove of those who do not honor their promises.\nIf the response-dependent view were true, then in those counterfactual\ncircumstances honoring one\u2019s promises would not be obligatory;\nfailing to honor them, accordingly, would not be wrong. But that is\nfalse, for basic moral principles do not exhibit this sort of\ncontingency. Even in those counterfactual conditions it would be wrong\nnot to honor one\u2019s word. If so, sentimentalists views, Reid\nconcludes, are false (see EIP VI.vi: 494\u201395).\n",
