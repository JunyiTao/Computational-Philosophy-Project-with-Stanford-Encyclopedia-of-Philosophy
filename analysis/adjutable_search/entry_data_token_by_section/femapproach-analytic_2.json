Various Ways to Characterize Differences Among Feminist Philosophers\n\nAlthough an essay on analytic feminism focuses our attention on\ndifferences among philosophical methods that feminists favor, these\ndistinctions were not salient in the early days of contemporary\nfeminist philosophy in the 1970s. Even during the 1980s and 1990s when\nmethodological and other differences came under more scrutiny, the\nquestion of whether a feminist philosopher finds more valuable\nresources in analytic philosophy or in pragmatism, poststructuralism,\nphenomenology, Marxism, critical theory, or hermeneutics was of more\nconcern to certain academic feminist philosophers than it was to the\nwider feminist scholarly or political communities. In fact, academic\nfeminist philosophers in many parts of the world report taking less\nnote of feminists\u2019 methodological distinctions than do feminist\nphilosophers in North\n America.[3]\n\nToday, although many feminist philosophers\u2019 mainstream\nphilosophical education still often focuses on one philosophical\nmethod or tradition, one can find \u201canalytic feminists\u201d\ndiscussing Beauvoir, Foucault, or Butler without hesitation. It is\nfair to say that because of feminist philosophers\u2019 political\nvalues and desire to communicate with other feminists, they are more\nmotivated to search for methodological cross-fertilization than are\nmany nonfeminist philosophers. (See the entries on\n intersections between pragmatist and Continental feminism\n and\n intersections between analytic and Continental feminism.)\n\nThe categories of feminist philosophies/theories most widely known\noutside academic philosophy since the 1970s are those developed by\nAlison Jaggar based on political values, goals, and assumptions.\nJaggar distinguishes liberal, radical, classical Marxist, and\nsocialist feminism. Each kind of feminism identifies the principal\nsources of women\u2019s oppression and encompasses an epistemology\nand a theory of human nature as well as political theory and\nstrategies for social change\n (1983)[4]\n It is very important to note that some women of color have long\nobjected to the widespread and hegemonic use of these categories (see\nSandoval 1991, 2000). In addition, because the categories are based in\npolitical theories, it is not surprising that they function better in\nsocial/political theorizing both in and outside of philosophy than for\nphilosophers doing metaphysics, philosophy of science, aesthetics, and\nso on.\n\nSandra Harding developed a different widely used set of categories of\nfeminist philosophies in the context of philosophy of science and\nepistemology (1986). Harding distinguishes feminist empiricists\n(practicing natural and social scientists who tended to rely on\nlogical positivist theories), feminist standpoint theorists who drew\nfrom Marxist epistemology, and feminist postmodernists. Although\nHarding is distinguishing feminists by philosophical methodology, it\nis important to emphasize that her category of \u201cfeminist\nempiricist\u201d captures a trend among pathbreaking women scientists\nwho aimed to hold scientific practice to alleged standards of\nscientific objectivity and neutrality; however, the assumptions behind\nthis trend are not what philosophers today have in mind when speaking\nof feminist empiricism. Contemporary analytic feminist empiricist\nphilosophers tend to be post-Wittgensteinian-Quinean-Davidsonian\nempiricists, so not subject to the principal objections Harding raised\nof the scientists. See, for example, Longino (1990, 2002), Nelson\n(1990), Solomon (2001), E. Lloyd (2008), as well as essays collected\nin Scheman and O\u2019Connor (2002), Nelson and Nelson (2003), Clough\n(2003), Superson and Brennan (2005), Grasswick (2011), Crasnow and\nSuperson (2012), and Garavaso (2018).\n\nAs we will see in more detail below, analytic feminists are among\nthose who argue that they are not captured by either Jaggar\u2019s or\nHarding\u2019s sets of categories. The analytic feminists who\ndistinguish their philosophical method from their political values and\nassumptions would reject, for example, a necessary connection between\nbeing either an analytic philosopher or an empiricist and being a\n liberal.[5]\n",
