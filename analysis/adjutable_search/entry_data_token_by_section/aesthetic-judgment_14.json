    "main_text": "The Notion of the Aesthetic || Some Terminological Remarks\n4.1 Some Terminological Remarks\n\nLet us now turn to the contemporary notion of the aesthetic. The\npredicate \u201caesthetic\u201d can qualify many different kinds of\nthings: judgments, experiences, concepts, properties, or words. It is\nprobably best to take aesthetic judgments as central. We can\nunderstand other aesthetic kinds of things in terms of aesthetic\njudgments: aesthetic properties are those that are ascribed in\naesthetic judgments; aesthetic experiences are those that ground\naesthetic judgments; aesthetic concepts are those that are deployed in\naesthetic judgments; and aesthetic words are those that have the\nfunction of being used in the linguistic expression of aesthetic\njudgments.\n\nThe most common contemporary notion of an aesthetic judgment would\ntake judgments of beauty and ugliness as paradigms\u2014what we\ncalled \u201cjudgments of taste\u201d in part 1. And it excludes\njudgments about physical properties, such as shape and size, and\njudgments about sensory properties, such as colors and sounds.\nHowever, in addition to judgments of beauty and ugliness, the\ncontemporary notion of an aesthetic judgment is typically used to\ncharacterize a class of judgments that also includes judgments of\ndaintiness, dumpiness, delicacy and elegance. In this respect, the\ncontemporary notion seems to be broader than Kant\u2019s, since he\nfocused just on judgments of beauty and ugliness. However, there is\nalso a respect in which the contemporary notion seems to be narrower\nthan Kant\u2019s notion. For Kant used the notion to include both\njudgments of beauty (or of taste) as well as judgments of the\nagreeable\u2014for instance, the judgment that Canary-wine\nis nice (Kant 1790, 5: 203\u2013204, 214 [2000: 89\u201390 and 99]).\nBut the modern notion, unlike Kant\u2019s, usually excludes\njudgments of the agreeable. Moreover, the contemporary notion usually\nexcludes judgments about pictorial and semantic content of a work of\nart. For example, the judgment that a painting represents a flower\nmight be \u201crelevant\u201d to an aesthetic judgment about it, but\nit is not itself an aesthetic judgment.\n",
