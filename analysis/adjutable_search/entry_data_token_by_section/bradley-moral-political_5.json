    "main_text": "The End of Morality\n6. Bradley\u2019s Political Philosophy\n\n\nBradley never produced a book on political philosophy and the few\npublished papers touching on social and political themes present views\nthat do not diverge from the position he set out in\nEthical Studies, in particular, in the fifth essay, My\nStation and its Duties. From that text we can see that Bradley\nwould have sided with the Twentieth Century communitarians who opposed\nthe individualistic political theories of Rawls and Nozick (see\nKymlicka, Chapter 4). In terms of the more recent debates about\nLiberal neutrality (see Wall and\nKlosko\u2019sPerfectionism and Neutrality)\u2014in\nwhich the liberals advance the claim that that political institutions\nand society\u2019s laws and institutional structures are not to\nreflect any particular conception of the good\u2014Bradley would\nundoubtedly have sided with the opponents of neutrality who think\ncultural, ethnic, religious and other such groups have a set of values\nthat are central to who they are and which they rightly feel need\nprotecting. Similarly, Bradley\u2019s views on individual rights\nare consistent with the social holism of \u201cMy\nStation.\u201d He opposed natural rights, taking rights to be\nsocial constructs. Indeed, in a paper in 1894 he allied himself\nwith the Utilitarians in claiming that the general welfare takes\nprecedence over the rights of individuals and went so far as to say\nthat \u201cthe right of the moral organism is absolute\u201d over and\nagainst the rights of its members (Collected Essays, p.\n158). In one discussion of punishment he takes seriously the\n\u201cprinciple of social surgery\u201d taken as \u201cthe right and\nthe duty of the organism to suppress its undesirable growths\u201d\n(Collected Essays, p. 152). All of this is consistent\nwith the claim in Ethical Studies that the moral standards and\ndemands of the society\u2014and by implication, acceptance of\nsociety\u2019s political institutions\u2014have a prima facie claim on\nthe individual members of that society.\nBradley also recognized the importance of social nurturing and teaching\nthat raise a human being from the level of its basic desires and\nimpulses to the level at which she becomes, and is recognized as, a\nrational moral agent. Only if one has learned the normative\nlanguage of the community and shows by one\u2019s behavior that the\nvalues and standards are understood, and that one is able to act with\nthem in mind, does a person get recognized as a member of the moral\ncommunity and treated as a full and equal member who can be reasoned\nwith and who will take the values embedded in, and reflected in,\nsociety\u2019s social and political institutions into consideration in\nher volitional action. Social and political institutions are not\ncreated by atomic individuals out of some pre-social primordial\nmaterial, and this marks the place that contract theories of the state\ngo wrong. Their basic error is to think that talk of individuals\nabstracted from all social relations would have any meaning. This error\nis compounded by assuming that individuals are pure rational\ncalculators without emotional attachments to others around them who\nenter into social cooperation only for personal gain. This error\nthen gets connected to the earlier error in theories such as\nLocke\u2019s when it is claimed that these abstract atomic individuals\nenter the contracting situation with a bundle of natural rights which\nthey hold as perpetual constraints on what others can do. Bradley\nand all the British Idealists thought that contract theories and\nindividualistic approaches to social and political relations were\ngrounding their political philosophies on false views of human nature\nand human society. In a word, their basic errors were mistakes in\nmetaphysics.\nAlthough it is not a topic for this occasion, it would be of some\ninterest to consider what his contemporaries had to say regarding the\ninterplay of ethics and political theory.  On this issue, Green\u2019s work\non ethics and his lectures on political obligation would be worth\nconsulting. Moreover, the student of this period in the history of\nBritish moral philosophy would also do well to compare the writings of\nGreen, Bradley and Sidgwick.  All three published around the same\ntime: Sidgwick\u2019s Methods in 1874, Bradley\u2019s Ethical\nStudies in 1876 and Green\u2019s Prolegomena to Ethics\nposthumously in 1883.  Taken together, these works provide important\nassessments of the writings of earlier moral theorists, such as Kant\nand J. S. Mill, as well interesting discussions of moral psychology,\ncentral moral concepts, and the role of moral theory.  These are all\ndifficult and complex texts - which makes comparative studies of their\nviews rather daunting.  Fortunately, some studies have recently\nappeared that offer useful introductions to such a comparative study -\nespecially, Mander\u2019s studies of the British Idealists and Irwin\u2019s\nchapters on Sidgwick, Green and Bradley in his history of ethics (see\nthe bibliography, below).\n",
