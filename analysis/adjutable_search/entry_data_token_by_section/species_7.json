    "main_text": "Species Pluralism || Varieties of Pluralism\n3.1 Varieties of Pluralism\n\nSpecies pluralism comes in various forms (for example, Kitcher 1984,\nMishler and Brandon 1987, Dupr\u00e9 1993, and Ereshefsky 2001).\nKitcher and Dupr\u00e9 offer forms of species pluralism that\nrecognize the species concepts mentioned above\u2014biological\nspecies, phylogenetic species, and ecological species\u2014as well as\nother species concepts. As we saw in Section 1.2, Kitcher accepts\nspecies concepts that require species to be individuals, and he\naccepts species concepts based on the structural similarities of\norganisms. The latter type of species are not spatiotemporally\ncontinuous entities. Such species merely need to contain organisms\nthat share theoretically significant properties. Dupr\u00e9\u2019s\nversion of species pluralism is more robust. He recognizes all of the\nspecies concepts found in Kitcher\u2019s version of pluralism.\nDupr\u00e9\u2019s pluralism also allows species concepts based on\nsimilarities highlighted by non biologists. For example, Dupr\u00e9\naccepts species concepts based on gastronomically significant\nproperties.\n\nIf one thinks that the term \u2018species\u2019 is a theoretical\nterm found within evolutionary biology, then one might find\nDupr\u00e9\u2019s version of pluralism too promiscuous. If the\nquestion is how the term \u2018species\u2019 is defined in biology,\nthen how it is defined outside of biology does not count. Think of a\nparallel situation in physics. When we are interested in the\nscientific meaning of the term \u2018work\u2019 we do not attend to\nits meaning in the sentence \u2018How was work today?\u2019\nSimilarly, the use of the word \u2018species\u2019 by culinary\nexperts does not reveal the theoretical meaning of\n\u2018species.\u2019\n\nKitcher\u2019s pluralism is more circumspect: it limits species\nconcepts to those that are legitimized by theoretical biology. Still,\none might worry that Kitcher\u2019s form of pluralism is too liberal.\nKitcher\u2019s pluralism allows that some species are\nspatiotemporally continuous entities (individuals), while other\nspecies may be spatiotemporally unrestricted entities (natural kinds).\nAs we saw in Section 2.1, Hull\u2019s evolutionary unit argument\nstates that within the purview of evolutionary biology, species must\nbe individuals. Kitcher\u2019s pluralism does not satisfy this\nrequirement. If one assumes that \u2018species\u2019 is a\ntheoretical term in evolutionary theory and that species are\nindividuals, then Kitcher\u2019s pluralism is too inclusive.\n\nAnother version of species pluralism is found in Ereshefsky (2001).\nThis version of pluralism adopts Hull\u2019s conclusion that species\nmust be spatiotemporally continuous lineages. Nevertheless, this\nversion of pluralism asserts that there are different types of\nlineages called \u2018species.\u2019 The Biological Species Concept\nand related concepts highlight those lineages bound by the process of\ninterbreeding. The Phylogenetic Species Concepts highlight those\nlineages of organisms that share a common and unique ancestry.\nEcological approaches to species focus on lineages of organisms that\nare exposed to common sets of stabilizing selection. According to this\nform of species pluralism, the tree of life is segmented by different\nprocesses into different types of species lineages.\n\nIt is worth noting that the motivation behind Dupr\u00e9\u2019s,\nKitcher\u2019s and Ereshefsky\u2019s versions of pluralism is\nontological not epistemological. Some authors (for example, Rosenberg\n1994) suggest that we adopt pluralism because of our epistemological\nlimitations. The world is exceedingly complex and we have limited\ncognitive abilities, so we should accept a plurality of simplified and\ninaccurate classifications of the world. The versions of species\npluralism offered by Dupr\u00e9, Kitcher, and Ereshefsky are not\nepistemologically driven. Evolutionary theory, a well substantiated\ntheory, tells us that the organic world is multifaceted. According to\nDupr\u00e9, Kitcher, and Ereshefsky, species pluralism is a result\nof a fecundity of biological forces rather than a paucity of\nscientific information.\n",
