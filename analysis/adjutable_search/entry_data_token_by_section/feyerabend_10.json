In his autobiography (pp. 103\u20134) he describes how\nAgassi had to help him prepare for these lectures, since they covered\na subject Feyerabend had never studied (see also SFS, p.\n116). He also describes how for some time he felt directionless and\nunsettled: he was \u201ckilling time\u201d. \n\nIn the summer of that year, he again visited Alpbach, where he met the\nphilosopher of science Philipp Frank (another former Logical\nPositivist), who exerted on him a (somewhat delayed) influence:\n\nFrank argued that the Aristotelian objections against Copernicus\nagreed with empiricism, while Galileo\u2019s law of inertia did not.\nAs in other cases, this remark lay dormant in my mind for years; then\nit started festering. The Galileo chapters of Against Method\nare a late result. (KT, p. 103. See also SFS, p.\n112).\n\n\nAround the same time, Feyerabend met David Bohm, who was lecturing in\nphysics at the University of Bristol. Bohm had been the favoured\nproteg\u00e9 of Niels Bohr, and his first book, Quantum\nTheory (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1951), was a lengthy\ndefence of the Copenhagen Interpretation of the quantum theory. But in\nthe early 1950s Bohm rejected his former view, and became one of the\nleading defenders of the then-unpopular \u201chidden-variables\u201d\ntheory. He was to be a significant influence on Feyerabend, weaning\nhim away from Popper with his somewhat Hegelian account of the\nstructure of reality. Feyerabend produced a critical study of\nBohm\u2019s 1957 book Causality and Chance in Modern Physics\nin 1960, when he was still very much under Popper\u2019s influence.\nIn their later work, though, Bohm and Feyerabend moved in parallel\ndirections, towards an interest in \u201cfringe\u201d science. And\nBohm\u2019s ideas sunk in gradually, having visible effects on\nFeyerabend\u2019s published productions from the mid\u20131960s\nonwards (see Van Strien 2020). Feyerabend increasingly flirted with\nthe vaguely Hegelian metaphysic that he had discerned and critiqued in\nBohm\u2019s book.\n\nIn 1956, Feyerabend got married for the second time, this time to one\nof his former students, Mary O\u2019Neill. But this relationship\nseems to have been very short-lived, for he reports that his wife\nspent Christmas 1957 away from him with her parents, that she\nsubsequently had an affair, and that the last time he saw her was\n1958.\n\nFeyerabend remembers his Bristol lecture course on quantum mechanics\nas being a disaster. However, in the summer of 1956, along with Alfred\nLand\u00e9, he chaired a successful seminar on philosophical issues\nin quantum mechanics at Alpbach. A related success was his\ncontribution to the 1957 Colston Research Symposium, where he gave a\npaper \u201cOn the Quantum Theory of Measurement\u201d. Here\nFeyerabend introduced what was to become a long-running theme in his\nwork: that there is no separate and neutral\n\u201cobservation-language\u201d or \u201ceveryday language\u201d\nagainst which the theoretical statements of science are tested, but\nthat \u201cthe everyday level is part of the theoretical\nrather then something self-contained and independent\u201d\n(Philosophical Papers, Volume I, p. 217, emphasis added).\nThis was his principal contribution to his central subject, the\nrelation between theory and experience. It constituted not only a\ndecisive break with the positivist conception of theories, but also\nsomething of a step beyond Popper\u2019s conception.\n",
