    "main_text": "The relation between the Treatise and the Enquiries\n2. The relation between the Treatise and the Enquiries\n\nIn 1775, as he was readying a revised edition of his Essays and\nTreatises for the press, Hume sent his publisher an\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d, asking that it be included in this and\nany subsequent edition of his works. In it, he complains that his\ncritics focused \u201call their batteries\u201d on the\nTreatise, \u201cthat juvenile work\u201d, which he\npublished anonymously and never acknowledged. He urges his readers to\nregard the Enquiries \u201cas containing his philosophical\nsentiments and principles\u201d, assuring his publisher that they\nprovide \u201ca compleat answer\u201d to his critics.\n\nHume\u2019s apparent disavowal of the Treatise and his\nregard for the Enquiries raise a question about how we should\nread his work. Should we take his statements literally and let the\nEnquiries represent his considered view, or should we ignore\nhis \u201cAdvertisement\u201d and take the Treatise as the\nbest statement of his position?\n\nBoth options presuppose that the differences between the\nTreatise and the Enquiries are substantial enough to\nwarrant taking one or the other as best representing Hume\u2019s\nviews, but there are good reasons for doubting this. Even in the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d, Hume says, \u201cMost of the principles,\nand reasonings, contained in this volume, were published\u201d in the\nTreatise. He repeats his conviction that he was guilty of\n\u201cgoing to press too early\u201d, and that his aim in the\nEnquiries was to \u201ccast the whole anew \u2026 where\nsome negligences in his former reasoning and more in the expression,\nare \u2026 corrected\u201d.\n\nHume\u2019s description of his aims suggests another option. Rather\nthan repudiating the Treatise, perhaps his recasting of it\nrepresents a shift in the way he presents his \u201cprinciples and\nreasoning\u201d rather than a substantive change in what he has to\nsay. He reinforces this option when he says of the first\nEnquiry that the \u201cphilosophical Principles are the same\nin both\u201d and that \u201cBy shortening & simplifying the\nQuestions, I really render them much more complete\u201d (HL 73.2).\nHe also comments in \u201cMy Own Life\u201d that the\nTreatise\u2019s lack of success \u201cproceeded more from\nthe manner than the matter\u201d\u2014more from its\nstructure than its content (MOL 8). It is not unreasonable to\nconclude that Hume\u2019s recasting of the Treatise was\ndesigned to address this issue, which suggests that we might\nunderstand him best by reading both works, despite their differences,\ntogether.\n",
