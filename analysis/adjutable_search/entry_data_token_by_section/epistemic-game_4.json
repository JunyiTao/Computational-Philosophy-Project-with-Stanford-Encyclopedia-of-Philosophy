    "main_text": "The Epistemic View of Games || Imperfect Information and Perfect Recall\n1.5 Imperfect Information and Perfect Recall\nIn a game with imperfect information (see Ross 2010 for a\ndiscussion), the players may not be perfectly informed about the moves\nof their opponents or the outcome of chance moves by nature. Games\nwith imperfect information can be pictured as follows:\n\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe interpretation is that the decision made at the first node\n(\\(d_0\\)) is forgotten, and so the decision maker is uncertain about\nwhether she is at node \\(d_1\\) or \\(d_2\\). See Osborne (2003: ch. 9 &\n10) for the general theory of games with imperfect information. In\nthis section, we briefly discuss a foundational issue that arises in\ngames with imperfect information.\nKuhn (1953) introduced the distinction between perfect\nand imperfect recall in games with imperfect\ninformation. Roughly, players have perfect recall provided they\nremember all of their own past moves (see Bonanno 2004; Kaneko &\nKline 1995 for general discussions of the perfect recall\nassumption). It is standard in the game theory literature to assume\nthat all players have perfect recall (i.e., they may be uncertain\nabout previous choices of their opponents or nature, but they do\nremember their own moves).\nAs we noted in Section 1.3, there are\ndifferent stages to the decision making process. Differences between\nthese stages become even more pronounced in extensive games in which\nthere is a temporal dimension to the game. There are two ways to think\nabout the decision making process in an extensive game (with imperfect\ninformation). The first is to focus on the initial \u201cplanning\nstage\u201d. That is, initially, the players settle on a strategy\nspecifying the (possibly random) move they will make at each of their\nchoice nodes (this is the players\u2019 global\nstrategy). Then, the players start making their respective moves\n(following the strategies which they have committed to without\nreconsidering their options at each choice node). Alternatively, we\ncan assume that the players make \u201clocal judgements\u201d at\neach of their choice nodes, always choosing the best option given the\ninformation that is currently available to them. A well-known theorem\nof Kuhn (1953) shows that if players have perfect recall, then a\nstrategy is globally optimal if, and only if, it is locally optimal\n(see Brandenburger 2007 for a self-contained presentation of this\nclassic result). That is, both ways of thinking about the decision\nmaking process in extensive games (with imperfect information) lead to\nthe same recommendations/predictions.\nThe assumption of perfect recall is crucial for Kuhn\u2019s\nresult. This is demonstrated by the well-known absent-minded\ndriver\u2019s problem of Piccione and Rubinstein\n(1997a). Interestingly, their example is one where a decision maker\nmay be tempted to change his strategy after the initial planning\nstage, despite getting no new information. They describe the\nexample as follows:\n\nAn individual is sitting late at night in a bar planning his\nmidnight trip home. In order to get home he has to take the highway\nand get off at the second exit. Turning at the first exit leads into a\ndisastrous area (payoff 0). Turning at the second exit yields the\nhighest reward (payoff 4). If he continues beyond the second exit, he\ncannot go back and at the end of the highway he will find a motel\nwhere he can spend the night (payoff 1). The driver is absentminded\nand is aware of this fact. At an intersection, he cannot tell whether\nit is the first or the second intersection and he cannot remember how\nmany he has passed (one can make the situation more realistic by\nreferring to the 17th intersection). While sitting at the bar, all he\ncan do is to decide whether or not to exit at an\nintersection. (Piccione & Rubinstein 1997a: 7)\n\nThe decision tree for the absent-minded driver is pictured\nbelow:\n\n\nFigure 3\n\nThis problem is interesting since it demonstrates that there is a\nconflict between what the decision maker commits to do while planning\nat the bar and what he thinks is best at the first intersection:\n\nPlanning stage:\nWhile planning his trip home at the bar,\nthe decision maker is faced with a choice between \u201cContinue;\nContinue\u201d and \u201cExit\u201d. Since he cannot distinguish\nbetween the two intersections, he cannot plan to \u201cExit\u201d at\nthe second intersection (he must plan the same behavior at both \\(X\\)\nand \\(Y\\)). Since \u201cExit\u201d will lead to the worst outcome\n(with a payoff of 0), the optimal strategy is \u201cContinue;\nContinue\u201d with a guaranteed payoff of 1.\n\nAction stage: \nWhen arriving at an intersection, the decision maker is faced with a\nlocal choice of either \u201cExit\u201d or \u201cContinue\u201d\n(possibly followed by another decision). Now the decision maker knows\nthat since he committed to the plan of choosing \u201cContinue\u201d\nat each intersection, it is possible that he is at the second\nintersection. Indeed, the decision maker concludes that he is at the\nfirst intersection with probability 1/2. But then, his expected payoff\nfor \u201cExit\u201d is 2, which is greater than the payoff\nguaranteed by following the strategy he previously committed to. Thus,\nhe chooses to \u201cExit\u201d.\n\nThis problem has been discussed by a number of different\nresearchers.[4]\n It is beyond the scope of this article to\ndiscuss the intricacies of the different analyses. An entire issue\nof Games and Economic Behavior (Volume 20, 1997) was devoted\nto the analysis of this problem. For a representative sampling of the\napproaches to this problem, see Kline (2002); Aumann, Hart, &\nPerry (1997); Board (2003); Halpern (1997); Piccione & Rubinstein\n(1997b).\n",
