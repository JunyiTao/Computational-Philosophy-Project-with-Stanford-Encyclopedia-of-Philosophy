The controversy has\nseveral foci. Five of the most hotly debated ones are existence,\nidentity, characteristics, originality, and authenticity. Is there such\na thing as Latin American philosophy? In what does its identity\nconsist? Does it have any distinguishing marks? Is it original? And is\nit authentic?\n\nThe disagreements in the answers given to these questions are deep.\nThere are at least four ways of looking at them depending on the\napproach used: universalist, culturalist, critical, and ethnic. The\nuniversalist views philosophy as a universal discipline akin to\nscience. Consequently, the fundamental issue for universalists turns on\nwhether Latin Americans have been able to produce the kind of universal\ndiscipline that one expects when one has science as a model. Its\nproblems are common to all humans, its method is also common, and its\nconclusions are supposed to be true, regardless of particular\ncircumstances. Most universalists, such as Frondizi, see Latin\nAmerican philosophy as largely a failure in this respect.\n\nThe culturalist thinks that truth is always perspectival, dependent on\na point of view. The method to acquire truth is always dependent\non a cultural context. Philosophy is a historical, non-scientific\nenterprise concerned with the elaboration of a general point of view\nfrom a certain personal or cultural perspective. Accordingly, the\nculturalist can allow for the existence of Latin American philosophy\ninsofar as Latin Americans have engaged in developing views from their\nperspective as individuals or as Latin Americans, and using whatever\nmeans they have found appropriate to do so. Whether they are original\nor authentic, or have produced a kind of scientific philosophy, are\nirrelevant matters. This is Leopoldo Zea\u2019s position (see Zea in\nGracia 1988\u201389).\n\nThe critical approach considers philosophy a result of social\nconditions, and closely related to those conditions. Some conditions\nare conducive to the production of philosophy, or what is sometimes\ncalled authentic philosophy, whereas others are not. Unfortunately,\nproponents of this position (e.g., Salazar Bondy, 1969) have typically\nseen Latin American philosophy as a failure in this respect because of\nthe conditions operative in the region. According to them, Latin\nAmerican philosophy is, and will continue to be, inauthentic and\ntherefore not true philosophy, as long as Latin American philosophers\ncontinue to emulate the views of philosophers from the developed\nworld. \n\nThe ethnic approach argues that Latin American philosophy needs to be\nunderstood as the philosophy produced by the Latin American people. The\nnotion of Latin Americans as a people is the key to understanding both\nhow Latin American philosophy has unity in diversity. It is one because\nan ethnic group has produced it, but it differs from place to place and\nacross time because different historical circumstances prompt the\npeople that produce it to address different problems and to adopt\ndifferent perspectives and methods. This approach seeks to understand\nhow Latin American philosophy can be universal, particular, and\nauthentic, (see Gracia, 2008, ch 7).\n\nQuestions concerning the notion of Latin American philosophy were first\nraised in Latin America in the nineteenth century. However, it was not\nuntil the end of the first half of the twentieth century that they were\nseriously explored, in particular, by Zea and Frondizi. Since then,\nthis topic has been a constant source of discussion and controversy.\nIndeed, it is perhaps the most discussed subject matter within Latin\nAmerican philosophy.\n3.4 Feminist Philosophy\n\nSince at least the 19th century, feminist academic work in Latin\nAmerica has had a complicated and generally ambivalent relationship\nwith academic and philosophical work more generally (Fornet-Bentacourt,\n2009). For example, after Independence, women were granted greater\naccess to education but recognizably feminist concerns tended to be\nmostly peripheral to academic and philosophical discussion. This\nhistory has led some to argue that feminist philosophy should be\ncentered not in philosophy but in a diverse collection of academic\nfields and (often activist) social practices. For example, Ofelia\nSchutte (2011) has maintained that feminist philosophy requires a home\nin a broader Latin American feminist theory and not in the\ndiscipline of philosophy in Latin America because \u201cfeminism is\ntoo new there to be able to effectively transform centuries of\nmasculine intellectual dominance in philosophy\u201d (p. 784).\n\nDespite feminist philosophy\u2019s ongoing ambivalent relationship\nwith academic philosophy in Latin America, there has nevertheless been\na recurring strand of academic philosophical work in an identifiable\nfeminist vein since the end of the 19th century (Oliver 2007, p. 32).\nFor example, Uruguayan philosopher Carlos Vaz Ferreria (1871\u20131958) gave\na series of lectures in 1917 on feminism, which were later published in\n1935 under the title Sobre feminismo [On\nFeminism]. Mexican philosopher Graciela Hierro (1928\u20132003)\npublished extensively on feminist ethics and the role of feminism in\npublic and academic spaces. Moreover, starting in the 1980s there has\nbeen considerable growth in the field, with important work by such\nfigures Mar\u00eda P\u00eda Lara, Mar\u00eda Luisa\nFemen\u00edas, and Ofelia Schutte. A good deal of recent feminist\nphilosophy has been transnational in its sources, explicitly drawing on\nacademic philosophy in the Americas and Continental Europe, but also\ndrawing from the history of feminist activism in Latin America, social\nscience research, and personal narratives.\n\nThe diversity of interests and positions of Latin American feminists\nmakes it difficult to provide a simple but accurate characterization of\nthe field. It is sometimes held that, in comparison to U.S. forms of\nfeminist thought, Latin American feminism has had a somewhat greater\ninterest in the critical analysis of families, class, and ethnicity\n(Schutte and Femen\u00edas 2010, p. 407\u20139). Consistent with the wider\nLatin American philosophical tradition\u2019s impulse to self-critical\nreflexiveness about its tradition, it is perhaps fair to say that Latin\nAmerican feminist philosophy has been particularly reflexive or\nself-critical about what it means to pursue feminist philosophy in\nLatin America. For example, feminist philosophers have emphasized the\nneed to recognize that academic philosophers, wherever they live, enjoy\na cultural privilege that may put them at some distance from the living\nconditions of most women in Latin America (Femen\u00edas and Oliver,\n2007, p. xi). Given such a model of \u201cepistemic privilege\u201d\nwhere, as a matter of actual social practices, the experiences and\ncategories of some tend to be valued over others, a number of feminist\nphilosophers have thought feminist philosophers have a special reason\nto consider the ways in which feminist goals are conceptualized and\nrepresented in popular and academic discourse (Schutte 2011, p.\n785).\n\nAlthough the future of feminist philosophy in Latin America remains\nunclear, it seems rather likely that a range of its prominent\nconcerns\u2014including activist philosophy, concerns for epistemic\nand cultural privilege, and reliance on interdisciplinary interpretive\nframeworks will survive in the interests of a range of academic\ncontexts.
