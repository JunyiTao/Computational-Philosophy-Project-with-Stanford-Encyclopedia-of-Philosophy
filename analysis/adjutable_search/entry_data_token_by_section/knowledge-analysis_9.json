    "main_text": "Modal Conditions || Relevant Alternatives\n5.3 Relevant Alternatives\n\nA third approach to modal conditions on knowledge worthy of mention is\nthe requirement that for a subject to know that p, she must\nrule out all \u201crelevant alternatives\u201d to p.\nSignificant early proponents of this view include Stine 1976, Goldman\n1976, and Dretske 1981. The idea behind this approach to knowledge is\nthat for a subject to know that p, she must be able to\n\u201crule out\u201d competing hypotheses to p\u2014but that only\nsome subset of all not-p possibilities are \u201crelevant\u201d for\nknowledge attributions. Consider for example, the differences between\nthe several models that have been produced of Apple\u2019s iPhone. To\nbe able to know by sight that a particular phone is the 6S model, it\nis natural to suppose that one must be able to tell the difference\nbetween the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 7; the possibility that the phone\nin question is a newer model is a relevant alternative. But perhaps\nthere are other possibilities in which the belief that there is an\niPhone 6S is false that do not need to be ruled out\u2014perhaps, for\ninstance, the possibility that the phone is not an iPhone, but a\nChinese knock-off, needn\u2019t be considered. Likewise for the\npossibility that there is no phone at all, the phone-like appearances\nbeing the product of a Cartesian demon\u2019s machinations. Notice\nthat in these cases and many of the others that motivate the\nrelevant-alternatives approach to knowledge, there is an intuitive\nsense in which the relevant alternatives tend to be more\nsimilar to actuality than irrelevant ones. As such, the\nrelevant alternatives theory and safety-theoretic approaches are very\nsimilar, both in verdict and in spirit. As in the case of a safety\ntheorist, the relevant alternatives theorist faces a challenge in\nattempting to articulate what determines which possibilities are\nrelevant in a given\n situation.[21]\n",
