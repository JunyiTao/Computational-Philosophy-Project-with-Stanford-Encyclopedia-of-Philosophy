    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods and Distributive Justice || Fully Rivalrous Resources?\n5.5 Fully Rivalrous Resources?\n\nOften, the goods that are the object of just distributions are\nrivalrous: money, health care etc. Some personal relationship goods do\nnot seem to be fully rivalrous: with respect to attention, friendship,\nor the emotions of love, it is not true that consumption by one\nindividual prevents simultaneous consumption by others. As Brownlee\nputs it:\n\n\nIf each of us gives love to everyone and seeks love from everyone,\nit\u2019s not the case that there will be an insufficient amount of\nlove to go around. (2016a: 71)\n\n\nAt the same time, since everybody\u2019s resources are finite, there\nare obvious limits to home many people can simultaneously enjoy a\nperson\u2019s love, friendship, attention, company etc. The fact that\npersonal relationship goods are not fully rivalrous should, in\nprinciple, create a relative abundance that facilitates their\ndistribution, especially if the right principle of distribution is\nsufficiency rather than equality.\n",
