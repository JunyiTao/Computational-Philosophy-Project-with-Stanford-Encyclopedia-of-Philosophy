    "main_text": "Issues in the Special Sciences || Max Weber and Objectivity in the Social Sciences\n6.1 Max Weber and Objectivity in the Social Sciences\n\nThere is a long tradition in the philosophy of social science\nmaintaining that there is a gulf in terms of both goals as well as\nmethods between the natural and the social sciences. This tradition,\nassociated with thinkers such as the neo-Kantians Heinrich Rickert and\nWilhelm Windelband, the hermeneuticist Wilhelm Dilthey, the\nsociologist-economist Max Weber, and the twentieth-century\nhermeneuticists Hans-Georg Gadamer and Michael Oakeshott, holds that\nunlike the natural sciences whose aim it is to establish natural laws\nand which proceed by experimentation and causal analysis, the social\nsciences seek understanding (\u201cVerstehen\u201d) of\nsocial phenomena, the interpretive examination of the meanings\nindividuals attribute to their actions (Weber 1904 [1949]; Weber 1917\n[1949]; Dilthey 1910 [1986]; Windelband 1915; Rickert 1929; Oakeshott\n1933; Gadamer 1960 [1989]). See also the entries on\n hermeneutics\n and\n Max Weber.\n\nUnderstood this way, social science lacks objectivity in more than one\nsense. One of the more important debates concerning objectivity in the\nsocial sciences concerns the role value judgments play and,\nimportantly, whether value-laden research entails claims about the\ndesirability of actions. Max Weber held that the social sciences are\nnecessarily value laden. However, they can achieve some degree of\nobjectivity by keeping out the social researcher\u2019s views about\nwhether agents\u2019 goals are commendable. In a similar vein,\ncontemporary economics can be said to be value laden because it\npredicts and explains social phenomena on the basis of agents\u2019\npreferences. Nevertheless, economists are adamant that economists are\nnot in the business of telling people what they ought to value. Modern\neconomics is thus said to be objective in the Weberian sense of\n\u201cabsence of researchers\u2019\nvalues\u201d\u2014a conception that we discussed in detail\nin\n section 3.\n\nIn his widely cited essay \u201c\u2018Objectivity\u2019 in Social\nScience and Social Policy\u201d (Weber 1904 [1949]), Weber argued\nthat the idea of an aperspectival social science was meaningless:\n\n\nThere is no absolutely objective scientific analysis of [\u2026]\n\u201csocial phenomena\u201d independent of special and\n\u201cone-sided\u201d viewpoints according to which expressly or\ntacitly, consciously or unconsciously they are selected, analyzed and\norganized for expository purposes. (1904 [1949: 72])\n\nAll knowledge of cultural reality, as may be seen, is always knowledge\nfrom particular points of view. (1904 [1949:. 81])\n\n\nThe reason for this is twofold. First, social reality is too complex\nto admit of full description and explanation. So we have to select.\nBut, perhaps in contraposition to the natural sciences, we cannot just\nselect those aspects of the phenomena that fall under universal\nnatural laws and treat everything else as \u201cunintegrated\nresidues\u201d (1904 [1949: 73]). This is because, second, in the\nsocial sciences we want to understand social phenomena in their\nindividuality, that is, in their unique configurations that have\nsignificance for us.\n\nValues solve a selection problem. They tell us what research questions\nwe ought to address because they inform us about the cultural\nimportance of social phenomena:\n\n\nOnly a small portion of existing concrete reality is colored by our\nvalue-conditioned interest and it alone is significant to us. It is\nsignificant because it reveals relationships which are important to\nuse due to their connection with our values. (1904 [1949: 76])\n\n\nIt is important to note that Weber did not think that social and\nnatural science were different in kind, as Dilthey and others did.\nSocial science too examines the causes of phenomena of interest, and\nnatural science too often seeks to explain natural phenomena in their\nindividual constellations. The role of causal laws is different in the\ntwo fields, however. Whereas establishing a causal law is often an end\nin itself in the natural sciences, in the social sciences laws play an\nattenuated and accompanying role as mere means to explain cultural\nphenomena in their uniqueness.\n\nNevertheless, for Weber social science remains objective in at least\ntwo ways. First, once research questions of interest have been\nsettled, answers about the causes of culturally significant phenomena\ndo not depend on the idiosyncrasies of an individual researcher:\n\n\nBut it obviously does not follow from this that research in the\ncultural sciences can only have results which are\n\u201csubjective\u201d in the sense that they are valid for one\nperson and not for others. [\u2026] For scientific truth is\nprecisely what is valid for all who seek the truth. (Weber 1904 [1949:\n84], emphasis original)\n\n\nThe claims of social science can therefore be objective in our third\nsense\n (see section 4).\n Moreover, by determining that a given phenomenon is \u201cculturally\nsignificant\u201d a researcher reflects on whether or not a practice\nis \u201cmeaningful\u201d or \u201cimportant\u201d, and not\nwhether or not it is commendable: \u201cProstitution is a cultural\nphenomenon just as much as religion or money\u201d (1904 [1949: 81]).\nAn important implication of this view came to the fore in the\nso-called \u201cWerturteilsstreit\u201d (quarrel concerning\nvalue judgments) of the early 1900s. In this debate, Weber maintained\nagainst the \u201csocialists of the lectern\u201d around Gustav\nSchmoller the position that social scientists qua scientists should\nnot be directly involved in policy debates because it was not the aim\nof science to examine the appropriateness of ends. Given a policy\ngoal, a social scientist could make recommendations about effective\nstrategies to reach the goal; but social science was to be value-free\nin the sense of not taking a stance on the desirability of the goals\nthemselves. This leads us to our conception of objectivity as freedom\nfrom value judgments.\n",
