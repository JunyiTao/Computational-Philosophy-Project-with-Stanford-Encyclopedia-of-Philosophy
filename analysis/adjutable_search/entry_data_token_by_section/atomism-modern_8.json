It marked a decisive break\nwith the idea that there is just one kind of matter, an assumption\nthat extended from Democritus to Newton and beyond. If Dalton's atoms\nwere regarded as ontologically basic, then there needed to be as many\nkinds of matter as there are chemical elements.  Further, atoms of\neach element needed to posses a range of characteristic properties to\naccount for chemical combination as well as physical aggregation and\nother physical properties. As a philosophical theory of the ultimate\nnature of material reality, Daltonian atomism was not a serious\ncontender and was not treated as such. A more significant issue is the\nstatus of Daltonian chemistry as an experimental science. To what\nextent was Daltonian chemistry borne out by and able to fruitfully\nguide experiment?\n\n\nA basic issue concerning the empirical statues of Daltonian atomism\nwas already pinpointed in an early exchange between Dalton (1814) and\nBerzelius (1815). Dalton was keen to present himself as the Newton of\nchemistry. In his view, just as Newton had explained Kepler\u2019s\nlaws with his new mechanics, so he, Dalton, had explained the laws of\nproportion with his atomism. Without atomism the joint truth of the\nthree laws of proportion is a mystery. Berzelius questioned the\nexperimental grounds for assuming anything stronger than the laws of\nproportion, since, he argued, all of the chemistry could be\naccommodated by the latter. That is, nothing testable by the chemistry\nof the time follows from Dalton's atomic theory that does not follow\nfrom the laws of proportion plus the experimental law of combining\nvolumes for gases.\n\n\nBerzelius (1814) expressed his version of Daltonian chemistry using\nformulae. Dalton had pictured atoms as spheres and compound atoms as\ncharacteristic arrangements of spheres. Berzelius claimed that the two\nmethods were equivalent but that his method was superior because it\nwas less hypothetical. It is clear that Berzelius's version cannot be\nboth less speculative and equivalent to Dalton's theory at the same\ntime. But it is also clear what Berzelius intended. His point was that\nthe testable empirical content of the two theories were equivalent as\nfar as the chemistry of the time was concerned, but that his version\nwas less speculative because it did not require a commitment to atoms.\nThe symbols in Berzelian formulae can be interpreted as representing\ncombing weights or volumes without a commitment to atoms. A Daltonian\natomist will typically take the hydrogen atom as a standard of weight\nand the atomic weight of any other element will represent the weight\nof an atom of that element relative to the weight of the hydrogen\natom. On such an interpretation the formula H2O represents\ntwo atoms of hydrogen combined with one of oxygen. But, more in\nkeeping with the weight determinations that are carried out in the\nlaboratory, it is possible to interpret atomic weights and formulae in\na more empirical way. Any sample of hydrogen whatever can be taken as\nthe standard, and the atomic weight of a second element will be\ndetermined by the weight of that element which combines with it. The\nformula H2O then represents the fact that water contains\ntwo atomic weights of hydrogen for every one of oxygen. Of course,\ndetermining atomic weights and formulae requires some decision to\nsolve the under-determination problem, but that is the case whether\none commits to atoms or not.\n\n\nBerzelius was right to point out that as far as being supported by\nand serving to guide the chemistry of the time was concerned, his\nformulation using formulae served as well as Dalton's formulation\nwithout committing to atomism. What follows from this will depend on\none's stand on confirmation and explanation in science. A\nstrong-minded empiricist might conclude from Berzelius\u2019s\nobservation that Dalton's atomism had no place in the chemistry\nof the time. Others might agree with Dalton that the mere fact that\nDalton's theory could explain the laws of proportion in a way\nthat no available rival theory could constituted a legitimate argument\nfor it in spite of the lack of evidence independent of combining\nweights and volumes. Atomism could be defended on the grounds that\nattempts to articulate and improve it might well fruitfully guide\nexperiment in the future and lead to evidence for it that went beyond\ncombining weights and volumes. But such articulations would clearly\nrequire properties to be ascribed to atoms in addition to their\nweight.\n\n\nBerzelius himself took this latter option. He developed an atomic\ntheory that attributed the combination of atoms in compounds to\nelectrostatic attractions. He developed a \u2018dualist\u2019 theory\nto bring order to compounds involving several types of molecules. For\ninstance, he represented copper sulphate as (CuO + SO3).\nHere electropositive copper combines with electronegative oxygen but in\na way that leaves the combination slightly electropositive, whereas\nelectropositive sulphur combines with oxygen in a way that leaves the\ncombination slightly electronegative. The residual charges of the\n\u2018radicals\u2019 as they became known could then account for\ntheir combination to form copper sulphate.\n\n\nBerzelius's conjectures about the electrical nature of\nchemical combination owed their plausibility to the phenomenon of\nelectrolysis, and especially the laws governing it discovered by\nFaraday, which linked the weights of chemicals deposited in\nelectrolysis to chemical equivalents. But evidence for the details of\nhis atomistic theory independent of the evidence for the experimental\nlaws that the theory was designed to support was still lacking.\nContemporaries of Berzelius proposed other atomic theories to explain\nelectrical properties of matter. Amp\u00e8re proposed electrical\ncurrents in atoms to explain magnetism and Poisson showed how\nelectrostatic induction could be explained by assuming atomic dipoles.\nIn each of these cases some new hypothesis was added to atomism for\nwhich there was no evidence independent of the phenomenon explained.\nNevertheless, the fact that there existed this range of possible\nexplanations all assuming the existence of atoms can be seen as\nconstituting evidence for atoms by those favouring inferences to the\nbest explanation.\n\n\nIn the early decades of the life of Dalton's atomic chemistry various\nattempts were made to solve the problem of the under-determination of\natomic weights and formulae. We have already mentioned the appeal to\nthe equal numbers hypothesis and vapour densities. The fact that\nchemists of the time did not have the resources to make this solution\nwork has been explored in detail by Brooke (1981) and Fisher (1982). A\nsecond method was to employ an empirical rule, proposed by Dulong and\nPetit, according to which the product of the specific heats and the\natomic weights of solids is a constant. The problem with this at the\ntime was, firstly, that some atomic weights needed to be known\nindependently to establish the truth of the rule, and, secondly, there\nwere known counter-instances. A third method for determining atomic\nweights employed Mitscherlich\u2019s proposal (Rocke, 1984, 154\u20136)\nthat substances with similar formulae should have similar crystal\nstructure. This method had limited application and, again, there were\ncounter-examples.\n\n\nOur considerations so far of the status of Daltonian atomism have not\nyet taken account of the area in which chemistry was to be making\nspectacular progress by the middle of the nineteenth century, namely,\norganic chemistry. This is the topic of the next section.\n",
