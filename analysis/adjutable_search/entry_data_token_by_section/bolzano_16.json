    "main_text": "Epistemology and Philosophy of Science || Immediate and Mediated Judgments\n4.4 Immediate and Mediated Judgments\n\nJudgments are psychical phenomena and they belong therefore not to\nWorld 3 but to our real world. Each judgment is an act or event that\ntakes place at a certain time in a certain mind and is herewith part\nof a causal network. As a part of our real world, each judgment comes\ninto being in time (and will pass away later on). From an\nepistemological point of view it is of particular relevance whether a\njudgment is caused or mediated by other judgments or whether this is\nnot the case, i.e., whether the judgment is \u201cimmediate\u201d\n(WL III, 123 ff.). If a judgment \\(m\\) is caused or mediated by a set\n\\(\\mu\\) of judgments, Bolzano calls the mind\u2019s transition from\n\\(\\mu\\) to \\(m\\) \u2018Schluss\u2019\n(\u2018inference\u2019), as distinct from the usage of this\nterm explained in section 3.8. An inference in this sense is\na mental process (belonging to World 2) of inferring a judgment \\(m\\)\nfrom a set \\(\\mu\\) of others; we can represent it by \\(\\langle \\mu ,\nm\\rangle\\). Such an inference \u2014 as opposed to an\n\u201cinference in itself\u201d or an argument \u2014 is a causal\nprocess, to be clear. Since by each of the judgments involved in an\ninference \u2014 by the members of \\(\\mu\\) as well as by \\(m\\)\n\u2014 a proposition is uniquely determined (due to \\(\\mathbf{G})\\)\nas its \u201cmaterial\u201d, by every inference \\(\\langle \\mu ,\nm\\rangle\\) an argument \\(\\langle \\sigma , s\\rangle\\) is uniquely\ndetermined, for which Bolzano has defined what it means, e.g., that\n\\(s\\) is a logical consequence of \\(\\sigma\\), or that \\(s\\) has a\ncertain logical probability \\(\\gt \\bfrac{1}{2}\\) relative to\n\\(\\sigma\\). (These concepts can then be applied indirectly to the\ninference \\(\\langle \\mu , m\\rangle\\) and used for its evaluation, as\nwe will see in the following section 4.5.)\n\nFrom the obvious existence of mediated judgments, however, it follows\nthat there must also be immediate judgments (WL III, 125,\n138\u2013139). Immediate judgments cannot be false and must therefore\nbe certain (WL III, 212, 229, 263). Certainty has thereby not to be\ntaken in its objective sense in which a proposition \\(s\\) is certain\nrelative to a set \\(\\sigma\\) of propositions iff the logical\nprobability of \\(s\\) relative to \\(\\sigma\\) is 1, i.e., iff \\(s\\) is a\nlogical consequence of \\(\\sigma\\) (WL II, 173). In the present\ncontext, certainty must rather be taken in a subjective sense in which\nit is primarily a property of a judgment; if two judgments grasp one\nand the same proposition, one of them can be certain (in this\nsubjective sense of the term) whereas the other one is not (WL III,\n263 f.). As the two most important kinds of immediate judgments among\nthe empirical ones Bolzano mentions judgments of the form \u201cI\n\u2014 have \u2014 an appearance \\(X\\)\u201d and \u201cThat (what\nI just now perceive of) \u2014 has \u2014 property \\(b\\)\u201d (WL\nI, 181, WL III, 131, 139, 229). Judgments of these two kinds are\ncalled \u2018(immediate) perceptual judgments\u2019, whereas the\nterm \u2018empirical judgment\u2019 is normally used only for\nmediated judgments containing a subjective intuition (WL III, 131 f.).\nThe propositions \u201cgrasped\u201d by these immediate perceptual\njudgments are empirical propositions whose subject ideas are\nintuitions that are usually expressed by means of the indexicals\n\u2018I\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019. Bolzano\u2019s philosophy of\nscience can thus be found to be empiricist, founded on a phenomenalist\nbasis.\n\nWith respect to all judgments \\(m\\) mediated by a set \\(\\mu\\) of\njudgments, it is of high relevance whether the argument \\(\\langle\n\\sigma , s\\rangle\\) corresponding to \\(\\langle \\mu , m\\rangle\\)\nfulfills certain criteria. In the sections 3.8 and 3.9 we have already\ndealt with two logical relations which can obtain between the\nconclusion \\(s\\) and the set \\(\\sigma\\) of premises of an argument\n\\(\\langle \\sigma , s\\rangle\\) and which can easily be transferred to\n\\(\\langle \\mu , m\\rangle\\): it is on the one hand the peculiar feature\nof \\(s\\) being a logical consequence of \\(\\sigma\\), and on the other\nhand the peculiar feature of \\(s\\) having a certain degree of logical\nprobability \\(\\gt \\bfrac{1}{2}\\) relative to \\(\\sigma\\). With\nrespect to empirical judgments, considerations of probability are in\nthe foreground. Logical consequence \u201ctransfers\u201d certainty,\nalso in its subjective sense, from the premises to the conclusion of\nan inference. That is to say, if each member of a set \\(\\mu\\) of\njudgments is certain for a person \\(A\\) (as is the case for each\nimmediate judgment), and if a judgment \\(m\\) is mediated or caused by\n\\(\\mu\\) insofar as it is inferred by \\(A\\) from \\(\\mu\\) as a logical\nconsequence of it, then \\(m\\) is also certain for \\(A\\) (WL III, 264\nf.). In order for this to be the case, it is of course not enough for\nthe argument \\(\\langle \\sigma , s\\rangle\\) corresponding to \\(\\langle\n\\mu , m\\rangle\\) to be logically correct, but it is required that\n\\(A\\) infers \\(m\\) from \\(\\mu\\) in virtue (kraft) of\nthe logical correctness of this argument.\n\nError and uncertainty have two possible sources according to Bolzano:\neither the premises that one presupposes are uncertain (or even\nfalse), or one has used a mere probability inference (WL III, 265 f.),\ni.e., an inference whose conclusion asserts the truth of a proposition\n\\(s\\) itself instead of merely asserting the truth of the proposition\n[\\(s\\) is probable] (WL I, 182 ff., WL II, 510, WL III, 212 f.).\nConsiderations of this kind amount to quite a refined epistemological\nsystem of subjective probability, in which Bolzano distinguishes\ndegrees of credibility and of assurance by using his probability\ntheory (WL III, 274\u2013288). Unfortunately, these investigations\nare little known, since they are only developed in the third volume of\nhis Theory of Science which receives far less attention than\nit deserves.\n",
