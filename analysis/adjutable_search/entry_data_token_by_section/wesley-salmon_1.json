    "main_text": "Probability and Induction\n2. Probability and Induction\n\nSalmon regarded probability as an essential component of science and\nhuman knowledge at large, and induction as the fundamental ingredient\nof scientific method. In so doing, he followed in the steps of his\nmentor Reichenbach, of whom he said:\n\n\nJust as Hume was the great empiricist of the eighteenth century, so it\nmay be, will Reichenbach be remembered as the great empiricist of the\ntwentieth century. (Salmon 1979b: 2\u20133)\n\n\nDavid Hume is undoubtedly a major source of inspiration for both\nReichenbach and Salmon, who placed themselves in the empiricist\ntradition, and shared Hume\u2019s conviction that prediction is the\nmain task of science, to be fulfilled using induction. By embracing a\nprobabilistic version of inductivism Reichenbach and Salmon intended\nto make a step forward in the direction indicated by Hume.\n",
