    "main_text": "Ethical Thought and Value Pluralism || The Emergence of Value Pluralism in Berlin\u2019s Work\n4.3 The Emergence of Value Pluralism in Berlin\u2019s Work\n\nSome of the elements of value pluralism are detectable in\nBerlin\u2019s early essay \u2018Some Procrustations\u2019 (1930),\npublished while he was still an undergraduate at Oxford. This essay,\ndrawing on Aristotle, and focusing on literary and cultural criticism\nrather than philosophy proper, made the case for epistemological and\nmethodological, rather than ethical, pluralism. Berlin criticised the\nbelief in, and search for, a single method or theory, which could\nserve as a master key for understanding all experience. He insisted\nthat, on the contrary, different standards, values and methods of\nenquiry are appropriate for different activities, disciplines and\nfacets of life. In this can be seen the seeds of his later work on the\ndifferences between the sciences and the humanities, of his attacks on\nsystematic explanatory schemes, and of his value pluralism; but all\nthese ideas had yet to be developed or applied.\n\nBerlin was further nudged towards pluralism by discovering what he saw\nas a suggestion by Nicolas Malebranche that simplicity and goodness\nare incompatible (1680, e.g. 116\u201317, 128\u201330); this struck\nhim at the time as an \u2018odd interesting view!\u2019, but it\nstuck, and he became convinced of its central and pregnant truth\n(2004,\n 72).[17]\n Berlin set out his basic account of what he would later label monism\nin his biography of Marx (1939, 37), but did not explicitly criticise\nit or set out a pluralistic alternative to it, although his lecture\n\u2018Utilitarianism\u2019 (1937b), dating from the late 1930s, does\ninclude an argument that anticipates his later claim that values are\nincommensurable. The basic crux of pluralism, and Berlin\u2019s\nconnection of it to liberalism, is apparent in rough, telegraphic form\nin Berlin\u2019s notes for his lecture \u2018Democracy, Communism\nand the Individual\u2019 (1949), and pluralism is also advanced in an\naside, though not under that name, in \u2018Historical\nInevitability\u2019 (1954: see 2000b, 151). Berlin referred to\npluralism and monism as basic, conflicting attitudes to life in 1955\n(Berlin et al. 1955, 504). But his use of the term and his explication\nof the concept did not fully come together, it appears, until Two\nConcepts of Liberty (1958; even then, his articulation of\npluralism is incomplete in the first draft of the essay).\n\nThereafter, variations on Berlin\u2019s account of pluralism appear\nthroughout his writings on Romanticism. Late in his life, taking stock\nof his career, and trying to communicate what he felt to be his most\nimportant philosophical insights, Berlin increasingly devoted himself\nto the explicit articulation and refinement of pluralism as an ethical\ntheory. He had referred in a private letter of 1968 (Ignatieff 1998,\n246) to \u2018the unavoidability of conflicting ends\u2019 as his\none genuine discovery. He devoted the lecture he gave in accepting the\nAgnelli Prize in 1988, \u2018The Pursuit of the Ideal\u2019, to\nexplaining what pluralism meant, and this remains the most eloquent\nand concentrated summary of pluralism. Berlin also discussed pluralism\nin many interviews and printed exchanges with other scholars from the\n1970s onward, in an attempt to work through the conflicts,\ncontroversies and confusions to which his ideas gave rise; but many of\nthese resisted Berlin\u2019s attempts at resolution, and continue to\nfigure in, and sometimes dominate, discussions of his work.\n",
