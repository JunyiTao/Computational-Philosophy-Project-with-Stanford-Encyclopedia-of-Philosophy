In fact, Brito develops his own account of the analogy of\nbeing, according to which being is predicated of substances and\naccidents with respect to a single concept, but under different\nmodalities (Donati 2013: 338). For him, the predication of being has\nreality in the ontological structure of things, specifically in\nmetaphysical constituents called presentations (apparens) or\nmodes of being (modus essendi). A thing\u2019s presentations\nor modes of being are properties of the thing that manifest themselves\nin its perceivable operations (Donati 2013: 344; Ebbesen 2001: 479).\nThese presentations explain both the common attribution and the\ndifferent ways in which being is attributed to substance and accident,\nwithout having to appeal to a multiplicity of forms. The common\npredication of being to substance and accident is supported by a\ncommon mode of being: their esse formaliter\u2014the\nprinciple of being that formally exists in both of them (Donati 2013:\n345). The different modalities of predication, in turn, are taken from\nthe substance\u2019s capacity to exist in its own right and by the\naccident\u2019s dependence on the substance for its existence, which\nare modes of being of the substance and of the accident, respectively.\n\n",
