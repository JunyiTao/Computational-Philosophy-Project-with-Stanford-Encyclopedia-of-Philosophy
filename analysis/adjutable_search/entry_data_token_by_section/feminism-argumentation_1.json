    "main_text": "Arguing to Win || Metaphors and norms of masculine aggression\n1.1 Metaphors and norms of masculine aggression\n\nThe metaphor of argument-as-war provides a central example for George\nLakoff and Mark Johnson\u2019s landmark book, Metaphors We Live\nBy (1980). War can operate as \u201cstructural metaphor\u201d\nfor arguing:\n\n\nThough there is no physical battle, there is a verbal battle, and the\nstructure of an argument\u2014attack, defense, counterattack,\netc.\u2014reflects this. (1980: 4)\n\n\nWithout that structure, Lakoff and Johnson suggest that we could not\neven recognize a piece of discourse as an argument.\n\nMoulton (1983) observes that prioritizing aggression in the practice\nof arguing and the association of aggression with certain forms of\nmasculinity is problematic. If people assume that success requires\naggression, then discussants must appear aggressive in order to appear\ncompetent at arguing. Not only may the assumption be false, but it may\nentail a distinct disadvantage for women. Cultures that treat\naggression as a natural quality in men encourage and advantage men in\neristic modes of engagement. When success demands aggression,\ncontributions to an exchange of reasons made in other\nstyles\u2014including those that read as feminine\u2014will not\nmeasure up; and they may not even be noticed. At the same time, a\nwoman can seem to be aggressive merely by asserting her own viewpoint\nor by showing competence in some other fashion. She may tend to stand\nout in many contexts as behaving inappropriately, even as her actions\nbecome acknowledged, because of her feminine social identity (Moulton\n1983: 150; Rancer & Stewart 1985; Hample et al. 2005; Kukla 2014;\nOlberding 2014).\n\nMoulton calls attention to ways in which philosophical approaches to\narguing and reasoning in Euro-American culture take on a pronounced\nadversarial dynamic that reflects aggressive expectations. Her concern\nabout the discipline and about models for argumentation is shared by\nmany feminist philosophers (Ayim 1988; Burrow 2010; Gilbert 1994,\n1997; Hundleby 2010, 2013b, Rooney 2003, 2010) and some who are not\nspecifically feminist (Cohen 1995). Maryann Ayim observes that a\nculture of hostility can be viewed in the militaristic, violent,\nsubjugating, and controlling language used to describe philosophical\narguing, especially the metaphor of argument-as-war:\n\n\nPhilosophers tend to value their \u201csharper\u201d students, whom\nthey may openly praise for their \u201cpenetrating\u201d insights.\nOccasionally they find students of \u201cpiercing\u201d\nintelligence, one or two perhaps with minds like \u201csteel\ntraps\u201d. Philosophers regard such students as important: They\nrequire \u201ctough-minded\u201d opponents with whom they can\n\u201cparry\u201d in the classroom, so they can exhibit to the\nothers what the \u201cthrust\u201d of philosophical argumentation is\nall about. This \u201cbattle of wits\u201d is somewhat risky,\nhowever, and a \u201ccombatant\u201d must take care always to\n\u201chave the upper hand\u201d, to \u201cwin thumbs down\u201d,\nto \u201cavoid being hoist by your own petard\u201d. If you find\nyourself pressed for time at the end of a lecture, with your\n\u201cback to the wall\u201d, or as it is occasionally even more\ncolorfully expressed, \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place\u201d,\nyou may have to resort to \u201cstrong arm tactics\u201d, to\n\u201cbarbed\u201d comments, to \u201cgo for the jugular\u201d, to\n\u201ccut an opponent\u2019s argument to pieces\u201d, or to\n\u201cbring out the big guns or heavy artillery\u201d. If caught in\nthe throes of a real dilemma, you many even have to \u201ctake the\nbull by the horns\u201d or rebut the dilemma by advancing a\n\u201ccounter\u201d dilemma. (Ayim 1988: 188)\n\n\nMartial metaphors and competitive evaluation foster the eristic goal\nof defeating others and their views (Cohen 1995), even perhaps, Ayim\nsuggests, for instructors in regard to their students. While this\nattitude may seem obviously inappropriate for instructors to take with\nstudents over whom they have authority, the available range of such\nlanguage suggests a general disciplinary culture that enforces\naggression through conflating it with success (Moulton 1983).\n\nAdmittedly, aggressive interaction may be comfortable for many women\nand uncomfortable for some men, and it may be inflected with class and\nrace biases with similarly variable effect. Yet these may be merely\nexceptions to the \u201cmasculine\u201d homosocial culture of\nhostility that many feminists maintain prevails in philosophical\narguing. Rooney argues that culture reinforces male status in the\ndiscipline and resonates with narratives of opposition against not\njust ideas but also against people who present them,\nespecially women (Rooney 2010: 229). Common ideals of masculinity and\nrationality coincide with the association of aggression with success,\npower, effectiveness, and vitality; they contrast with emotion,\nunreason, body, sexuality, instinct, nature, and\n rhetoric,[2]\n all notions that Euro-American cultures regularly associate with\nfemininity.\n\nIn the history of Euro-American philosophy, Rooney (2010) observes,\nmasculine reason regularly appears in battle against feminine elements\nof unreason, a battle that occurs both within the knower and among\naspects of thought. \u201cEmbattled reason\u201d constantly\nstruggles to subordinate feminine elements of unreason, and the\nsuppression of perceived negative qualities that are gendered as\n\u201cfeminine\u201d provides a central means for achieving the\nideals of reason and rationality central to the discipline. That the\ndiscipline functions this way can discourage women\u2019s\nparticipation. So, Rooney argues\n\n\nthat a full feminist accounting of the general cultural problem with\ngender, adversariality, and authority must include consideration of\nphilosophy\u2019s history and its lingering effects. (2010: 209,\n217\u2013219)\n\n\nOtherwise the discipline may continue to perpetuate sexist standards\nof reason from the larger culture and its history.\n\nDaniel Cohen (1995) suggests that antagonistic attitudes may not\nactually enhance competition and the knowledge it is supposed to\nserve, and that imposing the goal of agreement can silence rational\ndiscourse and undermine the goal of philosophy to further inquiry. The\nvalue of information that challenges our own beliefs can always be\nhard to recognize, a difficulty described as \u201cconfirmation\nbias\u201d, and this problem can be exacerbated when the focus of\narguing is winning rather than learning or ascertaining truth (Makau\n& Marty 2013: 39\u201340, 167; Linker 2015).\n",
