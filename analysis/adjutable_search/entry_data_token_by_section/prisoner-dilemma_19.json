Zero-Determinant Strategies\n\nIn a social network game, agents choose from a population of potential\nopponents; in the version of the IPD that interested Axelrod, agents\nmust play every other member of the population of which they are a\npart. The original description of the IPD by Dresher and Flood,\nhowever, concerned a single pair of players who repeatedly play the\nsame PD game. In a brief, but influential, paper a pair of\ndistinguished physicists, William Press and Freeman Dyson, recently\nreturned attention to this original version of the IPD, or rather to\nthe infinitely repeated version of it.\n\nLet's call this version of the game the (infinite) two-player IPD, or\n2IPD. In other versions of the IPD, where pairs from a larger\npopulation come together repeatedly to play the game, a successful\nstrategy is one that scores well. \u201cWell\u201d may mean (as in\nthe case of evolution under the replicator dynamic) a score at least\nhigh as the average score in the population, or (as in the case of the\nevolution under the imitation dynamic) at least as high as the scores\nof the most successful agents in the population. Under those\nconditions, it is much more important, in a particular round of the\ngame, to raise your own score than to lower your opponent's. Axelrod\nrepeatedly (and with cause) advised participants in his tournaments\nnot to be envious. In the 2IPD, however, the population size is two.\nIn that case it is as valuable to lower your opponent's payoff as to\nraise your own, and it can even be beneficial to lower your own\npayoff, if doing so lowers your opponent's more than yours.\n\nAnother noteworthy feature of the 2IPD, proved rigorously in Press and\nDyson (Appendix A), is that a long memory is unnecessary to play well.\nSuppose I adopt a memory-one strategy i.e., I condition each move only\non our last interaction. Then Press and Dyson show that you can't\nbenefit by using a longer memory: whatever strategy you adopt, there\nis an equivalent memory-one strategy you could have adopted that would\nnet us both the same scores. By adopting a memory-one strategy myself,\nI ensure that a longer memory will be of no benefit to you. Thus we\ncan, without loss of generality, take the 2IPD game to be a game\nbetween agents with memory-one strategies.\n\nA 2IPD game between memory-one agents (and indeed any 2-player, 2-move\ngame between memory-one agents) can be represented in a particularly\nperspicuous way. Let \\(\\bO_1, \\bO_2, \\bO_3, \\bO_4\\) be the four\noutcomes \\(\\bC\\bC, \\bC\\bD, \\bD\\bC\\) and \\(\\bD\\bD\\). The memory-one\nstrategies (as noted in the discussion of evolution above) are the\nstrategies \\(\\bS(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)\\) of cooperating with probability\n\\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\) after outcomes \\(\\bO_1, \\bO_2, \\bO_3, \\bO_4\\).\n(If we assume that the game is repeated infinitely many times and that\n\\(0 \\lt p_i \\lt 1\\) for \\(i=1,2,3,4\\), the initial move can be\nignored.). Let \\(\\bS(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)\\) and \\(\\bS(q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4)\\)\nbe the strategies of players One and Two. (The subscripts are switched\nfor Player Two, so that \\(p_2\\) and \\(q_2\\) both give the probability\nof cooperation after receiving the sucker payoff and \\(p_3\\) and\n\\(q_3\\) give the probability of cooperation after receiving\ntemptation.) Let \\(p'_i = 1 - p_i\\) and \\(q'_i=1 - q_i\\) (for\n\\(i=1,2\\)) (so that \\(p'_i\\) and \\(q'_i\\) are odds of defection). Then\nwe can represent the 2IPD between One and Two as a \u201cMarkov\ntransition matrix,\u201d that displays the odds of moving from any\nstate to any state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\bO_1\\)\n\\(\\bO_2\\)\n\\(\\bO_3\\)\n\\(\\bO_4\\) \n\n\\(\\bO_1\\)\n\\(p_1 q_1\\)\n\\(p_1 q'_1\\)\n\\(p'_1 q_1\\)\n\\(p'_1 q'_1\\) \n\n\\(\\bO_2\\)\n\\(p_2 q_3\\)\n\\(p_2 q'_3\\)\n\\(p'_2 q_3\\)\n\\(p'_2 q'_3\\) \n\n\\(\\bO_3\\)\n\\(p_3 q_2\\)\n\\(p_3 q'_2\\)\n\\(p'_3 q_2\\)\n\\(p'_3 q'_2\\) \n\n\\(\\bO_4\\)\n\\(p_4 q_4\\)\n\\(p_4 q'_4\\)\n\\(p'_4 q_4\\)\n\\(p'_4 q'_4\\)  \n\n\nFor example, the odds of moving from state \\(\\bO_2\\), where One\ncooperates and Two defects to state \\(\\bO_4\\) where both players\ndefect is given in the second row and the fourth column: \\(p'_2\nq'_3\\).\n\nViewing a game in this way makes it possible apply the machinery of\nmatrix algebra and Markov chains, which led Press and Dyson to the\nidentification of the class of Zero-Determinant (ZD) strategies. (A\nsimpler proof of Press and Dyson's central result, employing more\nmodest mathematical machinery, is given in Appendix A of Hilbe et al.)\nA ZD strategy is a strategy by which a player can ensure a fixed\nlinear relation between his own long-term average payoff and his\nopponent's. For example, TFT \\((= \\bS(1,0,1,0))\\)\nturns out to be such a strategy for any PD. If I adopt\nTFT, then I guarantee that, whatever strategy you\nchoose, we will get the same payoff. If you choose unconditional\ncooperation \\((=\\bS(1,1,1,1))\\) or GTFT \\((= \\bS(1,\n.25,1,.25))\\) we both get the reward payoff, if you choose\nunconditional defection we both approach an average of the punishment.\nFor other choices, you may get a payoff between the punishment and\nreward. Whatever you choose, however, you will still get the same\npayoff as me.\n\nThere are a variety of such ZD strategies for the IPD (and indeed for\nmost two-player, two-move games). For a standard PD with payoffs 5, 3,\n1, 0, three other representative ZD strategies are the following:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\textbf{SET-2}    & = \\bS(\\tfrac{3}{4}, \\tfrac{1}{4}, \\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{1}{4}), \\\\\n\\textbf{EXTORT-2} & = \\bS(\\tfrac{7}{8}, \\tfrac{7}{16}, \\tfrac{3}{8}, 0), \\\\\n\\textbf{GEN-2}    & = \\bS(1, \\tfrac{9}{16}, \\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{1}{8}).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nPress and Dyson emphasize strategies like SET-2 and\nEXTORT-2. If Player One adopts\nSET-2, then Player Two will get a payoff of 2 no\nmatter what strategy she employs. In the memory-one 2IPD a player can\nset his opponent's strategy to any value between the punishment and\nreward payoffs. Hilbe et al. call such strategies\n\u201cequalizer\u201d strategies, but in our context perhaps\n\u201cdictator\u201d would be a better label. If Player One knows\nabout the dictator strategies and knows Player Two to be a na\u00efve\nutility-maximizer, he can trick her into playing a strategy that suits\nhim by raising the level to which he sets her payoff when her recent\nplay satisfies his desires. Of course, a more witting Player Two might\nrealize that the same dictatorial strategies are available to her.\nThese will be of no use, however, unless they lead to a shift in\nPlayer One's behavior. If the existence of the dictator strategies is\ncommon knowledge for the two players, then they might profitably agree\nto set each other's scores to the reward payoff. Since each is\nemploying a dictator strategy, neither can benefit in the short term\nby deviating. If either deviates in hopes of a long term gain, the\nother could detect it by the change in his or her own payoff and take\nretaliatory action. Whether such an agreement is stable, of course,\ndepends on whether the players can make their threats of retaliation\ncredible.\n\nEXTORT-2 is an example of an\n\u201cextortionary\u201d ZD strategy. If Player One adopts\nEXTORT-2, then his payoff \\(V(\\bone,\\btwo)\\) will\nalways be \\(2V(\\btwo,\\bone)-1\\) (where \\(V(\\btwo,\\bone)\\) is the\npayoff to Player Two). Player Two can, of course, guarantee herself a\nreturn of at least one by constant defection. If she does, Player One\nwill defect with increasing frequency and their average payoffs will\nboth approach the punishment value. Because of the linear relation\nthat links their payoffs, however, if she does better than this, she\nwill necessarily lose to Player One. Indeed, any increment above\npunishment to her own score will be only half the same increment to\nher opponent's. Against a na\u00efve, utility-maximizing opponent,\nEXTORT-2 is even more effective than\nSET-2. No tricks are needed. Whenever the na\u00efve\nopponent scores more than the punishment payoff she loses to the\nextortionist. Whatever she does to increase her own payoff, will, of\nnecessity, increase the extortionist's by double the amount. The best\nthat she can do against EXTORT-2 is to cooperate\nunconditionally. This will result in the pair realizing the outcomes\n\\(\\bC\\bC\\) and \\(\\bD\\bC\\) in a ratio of three to one, giving the her\nan average payoff of 2.25, while the extortionist nets 3.5. Her only\nhope of escape is to abandon utility-maximization and acquire what\nPress and Dyson call a \u201ctheory of mind.\u201d If she realizes\nthat her actions might cause the extortionist to abandon his strategy,\nshe might herself adopt an extortionary strategy. This would lower\nboth of their payoffs in the short term, but she might hope for better\nresults in the long term. The upshot, according to Press and Dyson, is\nthat while an extortionist strategy will always defeat a na\u00efve\nutility-maximizer, the 2IPD between an extortionist and a more\nsophisticated agent becomes an ultimatum game. The extortionist\nproposes an unfair division of the joint payoffs, leaving his opponent\nwith the unhappy choice of accepting it or making both players worse\noff. (It is perhaps worth noting that this analysis omits the\npossibility that the extorted party is aware of the payoffs to her\nopponent as well as herself, and, realizing that the IPD is being\nplayed between just two agents, seeks to minimize the difference\nbetween her opponent's payoff and her own. Adopting such an attitude\nwould presumably lead her to a strategy of unconditional defection.\nThe payoffs of both players would then approach the punishment value,\nthe extortionist's from below and the extorted's from above.)\n\nNeither dictatorial nor extortionary strategies would seem likely to\nfare well in an evolutionary setting with larger populations. By\ndefinition, successful strategies become more commonplace in an\nevolutionary framework, and therefore more likely to face others like\nthemselves. Because dictators and extortionists do not do well against\nthemselves, any success they have in the evolutionary context will be\nself-limiting. Hilbe et al. confirm these intuitions. They show that\nwhen a very small population of general memory-one strategies is\nsubject to mutation and evolution, the time that agents spend\napproximating ZD strategies is reasonably high compared the number of\nsuch strategies that are possible, the relative time spent\napproximating dictator strategies in particular is higher, and the\nrelative time spent approximating extortionary strategies much higher\nstill. As population size increases, however, the proportion of time\nspent approximating all three categories drops rapidly. When the\npopulation exceeds ten, time spent as exemplars of these strategies is\nvirtually zero. At about the same population level, the average\ncomponents \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) of the strategies \\(\\bS(x,y,z,w)\\) of\nsurviving agents (representing the odds of cooperating after receiving\nreward and punishment payoffs) rise rapidly while average components y\nand w decline slowly, so that in larger populations the average of the\nstrategies looks like \\(\\bS(1, .9, .1, .1)\\)\u2014an imperfect\nversion of \\(\\bP_1\\). (As might be expected, as the average of\nstrategies approaches \\(\\bP_1\\), the average payoff increases and\napproaches the reward value. This suggests that in some circumstances\nthe familiar idea that cooperation is more difficult among large\ngroups than small ones gets matters exactly backwards.) \n\nAlthough extortionary ZD strategies fare poorly under evolution, Hilbe\net al., suggest that they do play an important evolutionary role, as\n\u201ccatalysts\u201d for the evolution of cooperation. They explore\nin some detail the course of evolution among agents restricted to a\nsmall choice of strategies, including unconditional defection, an\nextortionary ZD strategy and the familiar (relatively cooperative)\nstrategy \\(\\bP_1\\). In the absence of extorters, unconditional\ndefection predominates in a population of any size. In the presence of\nextorters, however, \\(\\bP_1\\) becomes more successful as population\nsize increases. In populations larger than fifty, it predominates. The\nsame basic results hold when unconditional cooperation is added as a\nstrategy choice. In the absence of extortionary strategies\nTFT can play a similar catalytic role, allowing\n\\(\\bP_1\\) to predominate over unconditional defection (with or without\nunconditional cooperators present). The short explanation is that\nTFT and the extortionary strategies can both drift\ninto a population of unconditional defectors as neutral mutants, and\nthe proportion of TFT can grow for a time.\nEventually, however, \\(\\bP_1\\) will do better than either.\n\nIt should be noted that Hilbe et al. defend and employ a\n\u201cpairwise comparison\u201d model of evolution that is markedly\ndifferent from the kinds of evolutionary dynamics discussed previously\nin this entry. At each stage a pair of agents is randomly selected and\nthe first adopts the strategy of the second with a probability that\nincreases with the difference between their payoffs. Under this kind\nof dynamics, if the rate of mutation is sufficiently low, the\npopulation will always move to \u201cfixation,\u201d i.e., a state\nin which every agent employs the same strategy. The time to reach\nfixation increases with population size and, if every strategy gets\nthe same payoff against every other, then the odds of strategy \\(\\bs\\)\nbecoming fixed are proportional to the fraction of the population that\nemploys \\(\\bs\\). These features correspond to familiar properties in\npopulation genetics but they are not true of, for example, the\nreplicator dynamics. \n\nIn a commentary on the article introducing ZD strategies, Stewart and\nPlotkin (2012) point out that more generous ZD strategies like\nGEN-2 had been relatively neglected by Press and\nDyson. If Player One adopts GEN-2 in a 2IPD with\ntraditional payoff matrix, then his payoff \\(V(\\bone,\\btwo)\\) will be\n\\(2V(\\btwo,\\bone)-3\\). Player Two then can allow Player One any payoff\nbetween the punishment value of one and the reward value of three,\nwhile ensuring that her own payoff is larger. Her highest paying\nresponse is \\(\\bCu\\), which results in the average long-term payoff of\nthree to both players. If she is willing to adopt a strategy that\nreduces her average payoff below the reward level, she will reduce\nPlayer One's by twice as much. Stewart and Plotkin (2012) report that\na strategy like GEN-2 actually gets the highest score\namong nineteen strategies in a simulated IPD tournament like Axelrod's\nthat includes TFT, GTFT, \\(\\bP_1\\),\nGRIM and other strategies championed in previous\nwritings. A version of EXTORT-2 gets the second\nlowest score. Significantly, the EXTORT-2 version won\nthe second most \u201chead-to-head\u201d contests, and the\nGEN-2 version won the fourth fewest. As Axelrod\nemphasized in connection with TFT, beating one's\nopponents is not the path to success in a PD tournament. Suggestive as\nit is, however, the Stewart and Plotkin commentary leaves open the\nquestion of whether it is the ZD-character of strategies like\nGEN-2 that engenders their success.\n\nIn more recent work, Stewart and Plotkin (2013) present evidence that\nsupports a qualifiedly affirmative answer to the open question. Their\nwork borrows from a detailed mathematical investigation of the\ninfinite IPD by Ethan Akin. Akin, 2013) focuses on strategies that\nsatisfy exactly the conditions we might want for a morally appropriate\n\u201csolution\u201d to the 2IPD: (1) use by both players ensures\nthe cooperative payoff, (2) use by both players constitutes a nash\nequilibrium, i.e., a strategy-pair giving each player a payoff that he\ncannnot improve upon by deviating from it unilaterally and (3)use by\nboth players prevents exploitation by either\u2014any change in\nstrategy by either player that reduces the payoff of his opponent will\nalso reduce his own. Akin labels such strategies \u201cgood\u201d\nand derives a remarkably simple characterization of them. A strategy\n\\(\\bS(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)\\) is good if and only if it meets the following\nconditions: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np_1 & = 1, \\\\\n(p_2, p_3, p_4) & \\ne (1,0,0), \\\\\np_3\\tfrac{(T-R)}{(R-S)} & \\lt (1-p_2), \\text{ and} \\\\\np_4\\tfrac{(T-R)}{(R-P)} & \\lt (1-p_2).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nIt is easy to check that, with standard PD payoffs,\nGRIM, TFT, GTFT and\nGEN-2 all meet these conditions, but\nEXTORT-2, SET-2 and \\(\\bP_1\\) do\nnot. (\\(\\bP_1\\) does meet the conditions when the payoffs satisfy \\(R\n\\gt \\tfrac{1}{2}(T+P)\\).)\n\nStewart and Plotkin show that the good strategies that are also ZD are\nexactly the generous ZD strategies, i.e., those like\nGEN-2 that concede a greater share of the payoffs\nbetween punishment and reward to the opponent. When the investigations\nof Hilbe et al. are extended to include focus on the good strategies\nand, in particular, to the generous ZD strategies, the patterns\nexhibited turn out to be quite different. In small populations,\nstrategies spend little time near these strategies in these two groups\n(relative to chance) and in larger populations they spend a much\nlarger proportion of their time there. In big populations a very high\nproportion of the strategies most strongly favored by evolution are\nboth good and ZD. The story is not entirely straightforward, however.\nStrategies that are good but not ZD are moderately favored by\nevolution, and a few strategies that are neither ZD nor good, are also\nstrongly favored.\n\nThere is no doubt that the identification of the ZD strategies has\nnewly energized investigations into simple games and into the IPD in\nparticular. Its lessons for the evolutionary PD and for the emergence\nof cooperation are not yet fully understood.\n",
