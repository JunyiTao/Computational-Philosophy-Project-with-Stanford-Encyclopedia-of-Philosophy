    "main_text": "Belief and Truth || Belief and Assertion\n4.1 Belief and Assertion\n\nRamsey\u2019s primary analysis of belief and assertion appears in his\npapers \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 (1926a), \u2018Facts and\nPropositions\u2019 (1927a) and \u2018The Nature of Truth\u2019\n(1929c), with some significant remarks on general beliefs made in\n\u2018Universals of Law and of Fact\u2019 (1928b) and \u2018General\nPropositions and Causality\u2019 (1929b).\n\nIn \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 Ramsey presents his view on the\nnature of partial belief, and this paper is considered the inaugural\nwork of the family of approaches to probability known as\nsubjectivism. Since the present section focuses on his\nsemantic analysis of belief and assertion, and not on subjective\nprobabilities, the analysis of partial belief developed in\n\u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 will be left aside.\n\nRamsey was a pragmatist about belief (Hookway 2005, 182ff; Dokic and\nEngel 2002, 2, 8, 55), although not about truth. He explicitly\ndeclares his pragmatism in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 (1926a)\nand in \u2018Fact and Propositions\u2019 (1927a). In \u2018Truth\nand Probability\u2019, he explains his approach to rationality as\n\u2018a kind of pragmatism: we judge mental habits by whether they\nwork\u2019 (1926a, [PP] 93\u201394). In \u2018Facts and\nPropositions\u2019, in contrast, the topic is the notion of meaning:\n\u2018The essence of pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning\nof a sentence is to be determined by reference to the actions to which\nasserting it would lead\u2019 (1927a, [PP] 51). He attributes his\npragmatism about meaning to the influence of Bertrand Russell. In\nfact, in The Analysis of Mind (1921), Russell explained the\nintentional properties of words through their causal history. As Acero\n(2005, 16) stresses, Russell at that time identified the meaning of a\nword with its use, and it seems to be this aspect of Russell\u2019s\nphilosophy of mind that Ramsey acknowledges as the source of his\npragmatism about meaning in \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 (cf.\nDokic and Engel 2002, 22). Sahlin (1990, 70) and Hookway (2005,\n185\u2013187) point out that Peirce must also have had an effect on\nRamsey\u2019s pragmatist views since many themes in Peirce\u2019s\nearly works are detectable in Ramsey\u2019s writings (Hookway 2005,\n185\u20136). More recently, Misak (2016a) has tracked Peirce\u2019s\ninfluence on Ramsey in full detail, using the entries on Peirce that\nRamsey inserted into his diary. It is now clear that Ramsey read\nPeirce extensively and that the American philosopher deeply influenced\nRamsey\u2019s views on meaning, truth and probability (Misak 2016a,\n157).\n\nAs a pragmatist, Ramsey individuates beliefs by attending to their\ncauses and effects. Thus, attitudes towards two sentences prompted by\nthe same causes and producing the same effects express the same\nbelief, no matter the linguistic constitution of the sentences used to\nexpress it. \u2018Belief\u2019, Ramsey acknowledges, is an ambiguous\nterm (1927a, [PP] 40). Both human beings and non-linguistic animals\ncan be said to possess beliefs. In non-linguistic animals, beliefs are\ndispositions to act; in linguistic animals, beliefs are mental states\nwith a particular kind of content that involves entertaining words.\nChickens that avoid eating a particular kind of caterpillar, due to\nsystematically connecting it with disagreeable past experiences,\nbelieve that caterpillars of this kind are poisonous. This is\nRamsey\u2019s causal theory of belief, which Dokic and Engel (2002,\n24) extend to beliefs of any kind and attribute to Peirce\u2019s\ninfluence on Ramsey. The beliefs of linguistic animals are\nspecifically defined in terms of attitudes towards complexes of signs\nwith logical structure (Hookway 2005, 185). Both kinds of belief,\nlinguistic and non-linguistic, are analysed in pragmatist terms, in\nwhich \u2018the relations between belief and action do take centre\nstage in some of [Ramsey\u2019s] most influential writings on this\ntopic\u2019 (Hookway 2005, 186).\n\nEven if the main targets of Ramsey\u2019s analysis are those beliefs\nexpressed in words and \u2018consciously asserted and denied\u2019\n(1927a, [PP] 40), it is still illuminating to consider his treatment\nof animal beliefs, in which the pragmatist connection between belief\nand action is yet more perspicuous.\n\nRamsey distinguishes mental and objective factors in his analysis of\nbelief. In the case of the chicken, the simplest one, the mental\nfactor is part of the animal\u2019s external behaviour (1927a, 159),\ni.e. its behaviour of refraining from eating caterpillars on the basis\nof disagreeable past experiences. The objective factor in this case is\na conglomerate of relevant aspects of the world, i.e. the caterpillar\nand the property of being poisonous, with which the mental factor\nstands in some kind of relation. In beliefs expressed in words, on the\nother hand, the mental factor is partly constituted by those words or\nsymbols \u2018spoken aloud or merely imagined, connected\ntogether\u2019. Beliefs expressed in words can be classified into\nthree different categories: (i) those whose content is represented by\npredicates or relations together with their arguments, i.e. by atomic\nsentences with simple structures such as \u2018aRb\u2019,\n(ii) those whose content includes logical connectives\n(\u2018not\u2019, \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019), and (iii)\ngeneral beliefs. In (i), the simplest linguistic case, an agent having\na belief that aRb means that she connects the words\n\u2018a\u2019, \u2018R\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 in her mind in a certain way. A further\ningredient of the mental factor in linguistic creatures is a sort of\nfeeling that accompanies the words in one\u2019s mind. By\n\u2018feeling\u2019 Ramsey does not mean a private sentiment, but\nrather some attitude of the agent that might be expressed in less\nsubjective terms, such as \u2018\u201cspecific quality\u201d or\n\u201cact of assertion\u201d and \u201cact of denial\u201d\u2019\n(loc. cit., n. 2).\n\nPurely private feelings towards contents, Ramsey argues, play no role\nin the analysis of belief and are useless for measuring degrees of\nbelief, as he explains in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019:\n\nAs soon as we regard belief quantitatively, this seems to me the only\nview we can take of it. It could well be held that the difference\nbetween believing and not believing lies in the presence or absence of\nintrospective feelings. But when we seek to know what is the\ndifference between believing more firmly and believing less firmly, we\ncan no longer regard it as consisting in having more or less of\ncertain observable feelings; at least I personally cannot recognize\nany such feelings. (1926a, [PP] 65).\n\n\nThere are basically two reasons why he takes private feelings to be\nirrelevant for the analysis of belief. The first of these concerns the\ndifficulty of assigning objective measurements, but undoubtedly the\ndefinitive reason rests on the fact that our most unshakable beliefs\ncome without any particular sensation (Dokic and Engel 2002, 7). As\nRamsey puts it: \u2018[N]o one feels strongly about things he takes\nfor granted\u2019 (loc. cit.). At this point, the similarities with\nthe view that Wittgenstein held in his pragmatist period are evident\n(for the mutual influence between Ramsey and Wittgenstein, see \u00a72\nabove).\n\nLinguistic beliefs of the second category, i.e. those that also\ninclude logical terms such as \u2018not\u2019, \u2018and\u2019 and\n\u2018or\u2019 are more complex. Concerning them, Ramsey heavily\nrelies on the Tractarian view of logical constants. Like Wittgenstein,\nRamsey thinks that logical words are not names, i.e. they do not\nrepresent. The meanings of \u2018not\u2019 and \u2018or\u2019 are\ndetermined by the agents\u2019 attitudes towards the sentences that\ninclude them. Believing that not-p and disbelieving that\np are \u2018equivalent occurrences\u2019 (1927a, [PP] 43),\ni.e. they express the same attitude because their practical effects\nare indistinguishable (1927a, [PP] 44; Dokic and Engel 2002, 24).\n\nA specific difficulty in analyzing beliefs of this second category\nderives from the need to identify attitudes held towards several\natomic sentences at the same time, while when atomic sentences are\nconsidered one by one only two mutually exclusive feelings must be\ntaken into account: full belief and full disbelief. The\n\u2018intermediate attitudes of partial belief\u2019, which he\nproposes to \u2018leave to the theory of probability\u2019 (1927a,\n[PP] 45), are discussed in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019. To\ndeal with attitudes held towards various atomic sentences at once,\nRamsey borrows from the former Wittgenstein the notion of\ntruth-possibility. When n atomic sentences are at play, there\nare 2n possible combinations of fully believing\nand fully disbelieving. Thus, \u2018the meaning of a sentence is\nagreement and disagreement with such and such\ntruth-possibilities\u2019 (op. cit., 46), and a proposition is\n\u2018a disjunction of the truth-possibilities with which [it]\nagrees\u2019 (op. cit., 47).\n\nThe third category of linguistic beliefs is general beliefs, i.e.\nthose whose expression involves the words \u2018all\u2019 and\n\u2018some\u2019. Concerning general propositions, Ramsey\nsuccessively held two different views. The first of these, explained\nin \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 (1927a) and \u2018Universals\nof Law and Fact\u2019 (1928b), is essentially the Tractarian view\nthat quantified sentences are conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic\npropositions (Sahlin 1990, 76; Dokic and Engel 2002, 30). The only\ndifference he found between conjunctions and disjunctions, on the one\nhand, and universal and particular sentences, on the other, was that\nthe arguments of genuine conjunctions and disjunctions can be\nenumerated, whereas the arguments of quantified sentences are given by\nmeans of propositional functions. These propositional functions show\ntheir usefulness in those cases in which either we do not know their\nparticular instances, or there are so many of them that enumerating\nthem is impossible. When such enumeration is logically possible we\nhave universals of fact; when it is not, we have universals of law.\nOne might think that the details that distinguish conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, and universals of fact from genuine general propositions\nwould vanish from the perspective of an omniscient subject who could\nentertain the totality of all application instances. Ramsey\nnevertheless rejects this idea because the role of general\npropositions is pragmatic, as an aid in the task of systematizing\n\u2018our knowledge as a deductive system\u2019 (1928b, [PP] 143),\nrather than semantic.\n\nThe second view appears in \u2018General Propositions and\nCausality\u2019 (1929b), and this is a fully pragmatist account\naccording to which general beliefs do not have a truth-value (Dokic\nand Engel 2002, 30; Sahlin 1990, 78). Here Ramsey presents his famous\naccount of atomic beliefs as maps: \u2018A belief of the primary\nsort\u2019, i.e. one without quantifiers, \u2018is a map of\nneighbouring space by which we steer\u2019 (1929b, [PP] 146). If\nbeliefs are maps of the neighbourhood, general beliefs \u2013\nunderstood as codifying general inferences \u2013 should be maps of\ninfinite extension, except that an infinite map is \u2018no longer a\nmap; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over before\nwe need its remoter parts\u2019 (loc. cit.). Quantified sentences are\nthus \u2018rules for action or attitudes\u2019\n(Dokic and Engel 2002, 31), and express \u2018an inference we are at\nany time prepared to make\u2019 (1929b, [PP] 146). Dokic and Engel\n(2002) also stress the similarities between Ramsey\u2019s account of\ngeneral beliefs and Wittgenstein\u2019s view of laws as rules of\ninference.\n\nGeneral beliefs with general contents, \u2018variable\nhypotheticals\u2019 as Ramsey calls them, are not propositions at\nall. With respect to the role of general beliefs, Ramsey is prepared\nto explicitly endorse a central thesis of any pragmatist approach to\nmeaning: \u2018[m]any sentences express cognitive attitudes without\nbeing propositions\u2019 (1929b, [PP] 147). The cognitive attitude\nthey express is still belief, which in the case of general beliefs\nRamsey characterizes as composed of (i) a general enunciation, i.e.\nthe endorsement of a sentence that expresses it \u2013 \u2018all men\nare mortal\u2019, for instance \u2013 and (ii) \u2018a habit of\nsingular belief\u2019 (1929b, [PP] 148). These two steps are\nconnected by the psychological law that gives the meaning of\n\u2018all\u2019 (1929b, [PP] 149).\n",
