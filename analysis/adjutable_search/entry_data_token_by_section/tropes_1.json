    "main_text": "The Nature of Tropes\n2. The Nature of Tropes\n\nAccording to several trope theorists\u2014perhaps most notably,\naccording to Williams\u2014what exists when a trope does is an\nabstract particular. The word \u2018abstract\u2019 is\nambiguous. On the one hand, Williams tells us, it means\n\u201ctranscending individual existence, as a universal,\nessence, or Platonic idea is supposed to transcend it\u201d\n(1953a: 15). On this meaning, to be abstract is to be\nnon-spatiotemporal. Tropes\u2014which are standardly taken to exist\nin spacetime\u2014are clearly not (or, not\nnecessarily) abstract in this sense (which explains why some\nphilosophers\u2014e.g., K\u00fcng 1967; Giberman 2014, 2022;\ncf. also Simons 1994: 557\u2014insist on referring to the\ntrope as \u2018concrete\u2019). But then there is this\nother\u2014according to Williams \u201caboriginal\u201d\u2014sense\nof the term. A sense in which, to be \u2018abstract\u2019 is to be\n\u201cpartial, incomplete, or fragmentary, the trait of what\nis less than its including whole\u201d (Williams 1953a: 15).\nIt is in this sense that the trope is supposed to be\nabstract.\n\nIs saying of the trope that it is abstract in this sense enlightening?\nSome have worried that it isn\u2019t (cf. e.g., Maurin 2002:\n21; cf. also Daly 1997). That this worry is unwarranted has\nrecently been pretty convincingly argued by Fisher (2020). When\nWilliams argues that the trope is abstract in the sense of\n\u201cpartial, incomplete, or fragmentary\u201d, Fisher notes, what\nhe means is that it \u201cfails to exhaust the content of the region\nit occupies or is merely part of the content of that region\u201d\n(Fisher 2020: 45; cf. also Williams 1986 [1959]: 3). One\nconsequence of this, is that the trope can only be attended to via a\nprocess of abstraction. (In Campbell\u2019s words (1990: 2),\nit can only be \u201cbrought before the mind ... by a process of\nselection, of systematic setting aside, of these other qualities of\nwhich we are aware\u201d.) But this, Fisher points out, does\nnot mean that the trope is abstract because it is a\nproduct of abstraction (if it did, then since attending to basically\nanything (short of everything) involves abstracting away from the\nsurrounding environment, saying of the trope that it is\n\u2018abstract\u2019 would be saying nothing very\ninformative at all). What it means, rather, is that the trope is\nsomething that requires abstraction to be brought before the mind\nbecause it is abstract (which, in turn, it is\nbecause it is such that it does not exhaust the content of\nthe region it occupies or is merely part of the content of that\nregion). This takes care of this worry (for more reasons to view the\nabstractness of the trope as integral to its nature, see the\ndiscussion in section 3.1 below).\n",
