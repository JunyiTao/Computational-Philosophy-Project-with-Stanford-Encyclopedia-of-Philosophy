    "main_text": "\n\nEarly philosophical interpretations of the general theory of\nrelativity selected distinct aspects of that theory for favored\nrecognition. Followers of Mach initially lauded Einstein\u2019s\nattempt to implement a \u201crelativization of inertia\u201d in the\ngeneral theory, but ultimately were more comfortable with\nEinstein\u2019s operationalist treatment of the concept of distant\nsimultaneity in the special theory. Kantians and neo-Kantians, if\nfreed from strict fealty to the doctrines of the Transcendental\nAesthetic and Transcendental Analytic, pointed to the surpassing\nimportance of certain synthetic \u201cintellectual forms\u201d in\nthe general theory, above all, the principle of general covariance. To\nan emerging logical empiricism, the philosophical significance of\nrelativity theory was above all methodological, that conventions must\nfirst be laid down in order to express the empirical content of a\nphysical theory. In a more far reaching development, already by its\ncompletion in November 1915, attempts were made to extend general\nrelativity\u2019s geometrization of gravitational force to\nnon-gravitational interactions, in particular, to electromagnetism.\nAmong these, that of Weyl, and shortly thereafter of Eddington, may be\ndistinguished from others, in particular from Einstein\u2019s many\nsubsequent proposals. Weyl and Eddington aimed not only at a unified\nfield theory, in the sense of a classical field theory in which all\nfundamental interactions are described by objects of spacetime\ngeometry, but also at reconstructing gravitation and electromagnetism\nfrom the epistemological standpoint of a refurbished transcendental\nidealism.\n",
