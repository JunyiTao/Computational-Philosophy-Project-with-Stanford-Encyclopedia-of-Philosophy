One\nalternative is to think of the precedent as representing a decision on\nthe balance of reasons in the individual case before the\ncourt that later courts are required to treat as correctly decided\n(see Lamond 2005). The precedent court took a range of facts into\naccount in reaching its decision. Those facts\u2014facts such as the\nbreach of trust, the trustee having power to transfer the property,\nthe recipient being a volunteer, and the good faith of the\nrecipient\u2014ground reasons for reaching some particular legal\nconclusion. On this approach, what the ratio provides is a\nstatement of the factors which the court regarded as providing the\nreasons that were crucial for reaching its result. So the\nratio represents the view of the court that those facts spoke\nin favour of the outcome, and that they were not defeated by any\ncombination of the other factors present in the case. For example, the\ncourt decides that the recipient of trust property must hold the\nproperty on trust if they are a volunteer even though they acted in\ngood faith. In reaching its conclusion the court must deliberate on\nthe competing merits of these two parties and decide which is better\nsupported. Both parties were ignorant of the dishonesty or\nincompetence of the trustee, so neither is favoured on that score; the\nrecipient has acquired property which the trustee did have the legal\npower (though not the right) to transfer, so upholding the security of\nproperty transactions favours allowing the innocent recipient to\nobtain the complete title to the property (leaving the beneficiary\nwith a personal claim for damages against the defaulting trustee); the\nprinciple that no-one can transfer a greater interest than they\npossess favours the beneficiary. Other considerations favour one or\nother of the parties. In making its ruling, the court concludes that\nin the circumstances of the case before it the merits favour the\nbeneficiary of the trust rather than the recipient.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between this approach and that in terms of\nprecedents laying down rules?  It lies in the fact that instead of the\nratio representing a rule which presumptively settles the\ndisposition of later cases whose facts fall within its scope, it\nprovides a pro tanto justification for such a disposition,\ni.e., other things being equal this is how the later case should be\ndecided. And it is this that provides a natural explanation for the\npractice of distinguishing. The correct statement of the doctrine of\nprecedent is that later courts are bound by cases\u2014not\nsimply by rationes\u2014and bound to either follow or\ndistinguish them. So later courts whose case-facts fall within the\nscope of the ratio must consider the precedent, but\ndo so in order to consider whether the differences in facts between\nthe later and the precedent cases justify deciding the cases\ndifferently. What the later court cannot do, on the other hand, is to\ndistinguish on the basis of factors that were present in the\nearlier case (even if they were not part of the decision's\nratio), because to do so would be to imply that the earlier\ndecision had reached the wrong conclusion on the balance of reasons. A\nlater court cannot treat the case as wrongly decided, unless\nit is able and willing to overrule it\n\n\nThe idea that a precedent is reaching a conclusion on the balance of\nreasons in the particular case at hand makes sense of a number of\nother features of common law judgments. It explains the practice of\nproviding elaborate accounts of the circumstances of the\ncase, even though only a small subset of those circumstances matter to\nthe ratio, since they were the group of factors that the\ncourt considered in reaching its decision. It is also consistent with\nthe lengthy discussions of the reasons for the conclusion, and the\nlack of interest on the part of courts in providing a carefully worded\nformulation of the ratio: what matters is the substance of\nthe factors considered in reaching the decision, not the particular\nlanguage in which they are couched.\n\n\nThe main challenge for this account of precedent lies in explaining\nwhen a later court is bound to follow a precedent which it\nregards as having been incorrectly decided. In the case of\nthe trust property, the later court may think the precedent court\nmistaken to have concluded that the recipient must return the property\nto the beneficiary. May a later court avoid the result of the\nprecedent by pointing to any general factual difference\nbetween the cases (e.g. this is real property rather than personal\nproperty, this is an implied rather than an express trust), and\ndistinguish the precedent by stating a narrower ratio?  After\nall, the balance of reasons never supported the precedent in the first\nplace, so shouldn't it be confined to the narrowest possible\nstatement of its facts?  In which case precedents seem to have very\nlittle binding force indeed.\n\n\nOne obvious possibility for avoiding this problem would be to ask how\nthe precedent court would have assessed the facts in later\ncase. But although this would be satisfactory in theory (if sometimes\ndifficult in practice), it again does not reflect legal\npractice. Courts sometimes approach the question in this way, but\noften they do not, and there is no legal requirement that\nthey do so. A better response is this: the basic common law\nrequirement in stare decisis is to treat earlier cases as\ncorrectly decided. A case may be distinguished, but only if that\ndistinction does not imply that the precedent was wrongly decided. So\nin the later case the court must decide whether the factual difference\n(real versus personal property, implied versus express trust) provides\na better justification against the earlier decision than the\nfacts of that case on their own. If it does, then the court may\ndistinguish (citing that differences with the original case), since\nthat does not imply that precedent was mistaken. If\nnot\u2014because real property or implied trusts raise no special\nconsiderations in this context\u2014then the precedent must be\nfollowed. This approach, of course, assumes that it is\npossible to make these sorts of comparative judgements (for arguments\nthat this is not generally possible see Alexander 1989, 34\u20137).\n",
