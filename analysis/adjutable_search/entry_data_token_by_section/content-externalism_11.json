    "main_text": "Extended Mind || The Mark of the Cognitive/Mental\n5.4 The Mark of the Cognitive/Mental\n\nTied to this lack of definitiveness is the third charge leveled\nagainst extended mind: the coupling-constitution confusion. A\nsimple charge of confusion is difficult to sustain. Proponents of\nextended mind are, in general well aware of the distinction\nbetween causal coupling and constitution. In the case of Otto, for\nexample, Clark and Chalmers argue that a sentence should be identified\nwith a belief\u2014rather than the latter being merely coupled with\nthe former\u2014precisely because the sentence has the functional\nrole of a belief. A more plausible form of the objection might be that\nthe arguments provided by proponents of extended mind\u2014whether state- or process-oriented\u2014do not\nestablish what these proponents have taken them to\nestablish. Specifically, they do not establish anything more than the\nclaim that cognitive processes are coupled with external processes\nrather than that they are constituted by them. Answering both the\noriginal intentionality objection and the coupling-constitution\nobjection, therefore, seems to require the ability to identity when a\nprocess is, and is not, a cognitive process.\n\nRupert (2009) argues that the best way to approach this is through the\nidentification of a cognitive system, an identification that will rest\nheavily on how the sciences of the mind individuate such systems. The\nmost plausible conception of a cognitive system, he argues, counts\nagainst extended mind. Another approach argues the need for\nidentification of a mark of the cognitive\u2014a set of\nnecessary, sufficient, or necessary and sufficient, conditions for a\nprocess to count as cognitive. Reaction to this suggestion can be\ndivided into three broad camps. First, there are those who think that\na mark of the cognitive is not necessary. Just as we can study biology\nwithout a mark of the biological, and practice medicine without a\ncriterion of the medical, we can also do cognitive science without a\ncriterion of the cognitive (Allen 2017). Second, there are those who\nthink a criterion of cognition is required, can be identified, and\ncounts against extended mind (Adams 2010). Third, there are\nthose who think a criterion of the cognitive is available and it\nsupports extended mind (Rowlands 2009, 2010).\n",
