    "preamble": "\n\nRichard Rorty (1931\u20132007) developed a distinctive and\ncontroversial brand of pragmatism that expressed itself along two main\naxes. One is negative \u2013 a critical diagnosis of what Rorty takes\nto be defining projects of modern philosophy. The other is positive\n\u2013 an attempt to show what intellectual culture might look like,\nonce we free ourselves from the governing metaphors of mind and\nknowledge in which the traditional problems of epistemology and\nmetaphysics (and indeed, in Rorty\u2019s view, the self-conception of\nmodern philosophy) are rooted. The centerpiece of Rorty\u2019s\ncritique is the provocative account offered in Philosophy and the\nMirror of Nature (1979, hereafter PMN). In this book, and in the\nclosely related essays collected in Consequences of\nPragmatism (1982, hereafter CP), Rorty\u2019s principal target\nis the philosophical idea of knowledge as representation, as a mental\nmirroring of a mind-external world. Providing a contrasting image of\nphilosophy, Rorty has sought to integrate and apply the milestone\nachievements of Dewey, Hegel and Darwin in a pragmatist synthesis of\nhistoricism and naturalism. Characterizations and illustrations of a\npost-epistemological intellectual culture, present in both PMN (part\nIII) and CP (xxxvii\u2013xliv), are more richly developed in later\nworks, such as Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (1989,\nhereafter CIS), in the popular essays and articles collected in\nPhilosophy and Social Hope (1999, hereafter PSH), and in the\nfour volumes of philosophical papers, Objectivity, Relativism, and\nTruth (1991, hereafter ORT); Essays on Heidegger and\nOthers (1991, hereafter EHO); Truth and Progress (1998,\nhereafter TP); and Philosophy as Cultural Politics (2007,\nhereafter PCP). In these writings, ranging over an unusually wide\nintellectual territory, Rorty offers a highly integrated, multifaceted\nview of thought, culture, and politics, a view that has made him one\nof the most widely discussed philosophers in our time.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nRichard McKay Rorty was born on October 4th, 1931, in New York City.\nHe grew up, as he recounts in Achieving Our Country (1998,\nhereafter AOC), \u201con the anti-communist reformist Left in\nmid-century\u201d (AOC, 59), within a circle combining anti-Stalinism\nwith leftist social activism. \u201cIn that circle,\u201d Rorty\ntells us, \u201cAmerican patriotism, redistributionist economics,\nanticommunism, and Deweyan pragmatism went together easily and\nnaturally\u201d (AOC, 61). In 1946, Rorty went to the University of\nChicago, to a philosophy department which at that time included\nRudolph Carnap, Charles Hartshorne, and Richard McKeon, all of whom\nwere Rorty\u2019s teachers. After receiving his BA in 1949, Rorty\nstayed on at Chicago to complete an M.A. (1952) with a thesis on\nWhitehead supervised by Hartshorne. From 1952 to 1956 Rorty was at\nYale, where he wrote a dissertation entitled \u201cThe Concept of\nPotentiality.\u201d His supervisor was Paul Weiss. After the\ncompletion of his Ph.D., followed by two years in the army, Rorty\nreceived his first academic appointment, at Wellesley College. In\n1961, after three years at Wellesley, Rorty moved to Princeton\nUniversity where he stayed until he went to the University of\nVirginia, in 1982, as Kenan Professor of the Humanities. Rorty left\nthe University of Virginia in 1998, accepting an appointment in the\nDepartment of Comparative Literature at Stanford University. In the\ncourse of his career, Rorty received several academic awards and\nhonours, including a Guggenheim Fellowship (1973\u201374) and a\nMacArthur Fellowship (1981\u20131986). He held a number of\nprestigious lectureships, giving, among others, the Northcliffe\nLectures at University College, London (1986), the Clark Lectures at\nTrinity College, Cambridge (1987), and the Massey Lectures at Harvard\n(1997). Rorty died on June 8th, 2007.\n2. Against Epistemology\n\nOn Rorty\u2019s account, modern epistemology is not only an attempt\nto legitimate our claim to knowledge of what is real, but also an\nattempt to legitimate philosophical reflection itself \u2013 a\npressing task, on many accounts, once the advent of the so-called\nnew science of the sixteenth and seventeenth century\ngradually gave content to a notion of knowledge obtained by the\nmethodological interrogation of nature itself. Because the result of\nthis kind of interrogation, theoretical empirical knowledge, is so\nobviously fruitful, and also carries with it seemingly uncontentious\nnorms of progress, its mere presence poses a legitimation challenge to\na form of thought, and claim to knowledge, that is distinct from it.\nCartesian epistemology, in Rorty\u2019s picture, is designed to meet\nthis challenge. It is sceptical in a fundamental way; sceptical doubts\nof a Cartesian sort, that is, doubts that can be raised about any set\nof empirical claims whatever, and so cannot be alleviated by\nexperience, are tailor-made to preserve at once a domain and a job for\nphilosophical reflection. Rorty\u2019s aim in PMN is to undermine the\nassumptions in light of which this double legitimation project makes\nsense.\n2.1 Epistemological Behaviorism\n\nThat any vocabulary is optional and mutable is the basic conviction\nbehind Rorty\u2019s attack on representationalist epistemology\ncarried out in PMN. It informs, for instance, the genealogy (chapter\none) and deconstruction (chapter two) of the concept of mind offered\nin the book\u2019s first part, \u201cOur Glassy Essence.\u201d This\nhistoricist conviction, however, is not itself a central theme of PMN,\nand it emerges for explicit discussion only in the final section of\nthe book, \u201cPhilosophy,\u201d which is the shortest and in some\nways least developed of its three parts. The argumentative core of PMN\nis found in its second part, \u201cMirroring.\u201d Here Rorty\ndevelops and extends a diverse lot of arguments \u2013 notably from\nWilfrid Sellars, Willard van Orman Quine, Thomas Kuhn, Ludwig\nWittgenstein, and Donald Davidson \u2013 into a general critique of\nthe defining project of modern epistemology, viz., the conceptions of\nmind, of knowledge and of philosophy bequeathed by the 17th\nand 18th centuries. Rorty\u2019s key claim is that\n\u201cthe Kantian picture of concepts and intuitions getting together\nto produce knowledge is needed to give sense to the idea of\n\u2018theory of knowledge\u2019 as a specifically philosophical\ndiscipline, distinct from psychology\u201d (PMN, 168). According to\nRorty,\n\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that if we do not have the distinction\nbetween what is \u201cgiven\u201d and what is \u201cadded by the\nmind,\u201d or that between the \u201ccontingent\u201d (because\ninfluenced by what is given) and the necessary (because entirely\n\u201cwithin\u201d the mind and under its control), then we will not\nknow what would count as a \u201crational reconstruction\u201d of\nour knowledge. We will not know what epistemology\u2019s goal or\nmethod could be. (PMN, 168\u20139)\n\n\nEpistemology, in Rorty\u2019s account, is wedded to a picture of\nmind\u2019s structure working on empirical content to produce in\nitself items \u2013 thoughts, representations \u2013 which, when\nthings go well, correctly mirror reality. To loosen the grip of this\npicture on our thinking is to challenge the idea that epistemology\n\u2013 whether traditional Cartesian or 20th century linguistic\n\u2013 is the essence of philosophy. To this end, Rorty combines a\nreading of Quine\u2019s attack on a version of the structure-content\ndistinction in \u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d (1951) with a\nreading of Sellars\u2019 attack on the idea of givenness in\n\u201cEmpiricism and the Philosophy of Mind\u201d (1956/1997). On\nRorty\u2019s reading, though neither Sellars nor Quine is able fully\nto take in the liberating influence of the other, they are really\nattacking the same distinction, or set of distinctions. While Quine\ncasts doubt on the notion of structure or meaning which\nlinguistically-turned epistemology had instated in place of mental\nentities, Sellars, questioning the very idea of givenness, came at the\ndistinction from the other side:\n\n\n\u2026Sellars and Quine invoke the same argument, one which bears\nequally against the given-versus-nongiven and the\nnecessary-versus-contingent distinctions. The crucial premise of this\nargument is that we understand knowledge when we understand the social\njustification of belief, and thus have no need to view it as accuracy\nof representation. (PMN, 170)\n\n\nThe upshot of Quine\u2019s and Sellars\u2019 criticisms of the myths\nand dogmas of epistemology is, Rorty suggests, that \u201cwe see\nknowledge as a matter of conversation and of social practice, rather\nthan as an attempt to mirror nature\u201d (PMN, 171). Rorty provides\nthis view with a label: \u201cExplaining rationality and epistemic\nauthority by reference to what society lets us say, rather than the\nlatter by the former, is the essence of what I shall call\n\u2018epistemological behaviorism,\u2019 an attitude common to Dewey\nand Wittgenstein\u201d (PMN, 174).\n\nEpistemological behaviorism leaves no room for the kind of\npractice-transcending legitimation that Rorty identifies as the\ndefining aspiration of modern epistemology. Assuming that epistemic\npractices do, or at least can, diverge, it is not surprising that\nRorty\u2019s commitment to epistemological behaviorism should lead to\ncharges of relativism or subjectivism. Indeed, many who share\nRorty\u2019s historicist scepticism toward the transcending ambitions\nof epistemology \u2013 friendly critics like Hilary Putnam, John\nMcDowell and Daniel Dennett \u2013 balk at the idea that there are no\nconstraints on knowledge save conversational ones. Yet this is a\ncentral part of Rorty\u2019s position, repeated and elaborated as\nlate as in TP and PCP. Indeed, in TP he invokes it precisely in order\nto deflect this sort of criticism. In \u201cHilary Putnam and the\nRelativist Menace,\u201d Rorty says:\n\n\nIn short, my strategy for escaping the self-referential difficulties\ninto which \u201cthe Relativist\u201d keeps getting himself is to\nmove everything over from epistemology and metaphysics into cultural\npolitics, from claims to knowledge and appeals to self-evidence to\nsuggestions about what we should try. (TP, 57)\n\n\nThat epistemological behaviorism differs from traditional forms of\nrelativism and subjectivism is easier to see in light of Rorty\u2019s\ncriticism of the notion of representation, and the cluster of\nphilosophical images which surround it.\n2.2 Antirepresentationalism\n\nRorty\u2019s enduring attitude to relativism and subjectivism is that\nboth are products of the representationalist paradigm. Though the\ntheme is explicit in PMN and CP (\u201cPragmatism, Relativism,\nIrrationalism\u201d), it is with Rorty\u2019s later and further\nappropriation of Davidson that his criticism of the idea of knowledge\nas representation becomes fully elaborated (ORT,\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d and Part II). Drawing on Davidson\u2019s\ncriticism of the scheme-content distinction (\u201cOn the Very Idea\nof a Conceptual Scheme\u201d) and of the correspondence theory of\ntruth (\u201cThe Structure and Content of Truth\u201d), Rorty is\nable to back up his rejection of any philosophical position or project\nwhich attempts to draw a general line between what is made and what is\nfound, what is subjective and what is objective, what is mere\nappearance and what is real. Rorty\u2019s position is not that these\nconceptual contrasts never have application, but that such application\nis always context and interest bound and that there is, as in the case\nof the related notion of truth, nothing to be said about them in\ngeneral. Rorty\u2019s commitment to the conversationalist view of\nknowledge must therefore be distinguished from subjectivism or\nrelativism, which, Rorty argues, presuppose the very distinctions he\nseeks to reject. Equally, Rorty\u2019s epistemological behaviorism\nmust not be confused with an idealism that asserts a primacy of\nthought or language with respect to the unmediated world, since this,\ntoo, is a position that is undercut by Rorty\u2019s Davidsonian\nposition. In light of the view of truth and of meaning that Rorty\nappropriates from Davidson, his conversationalism is not a matter of\ngiving priority to the subjective over the objective, or to\nmind\u2019s power over world\u2019s constraint. Rather it is the\nother side of his anti-representationalism, which denies that we are\nrelated to the world in anything other than causal terms. Differently\nput, Rorty argues that we can give no useful content to the notion\nthat the world, by its very nature, rationally constrains choices of\nvocabulary with which to cope with it (TP, \u201cThe Very Idea of\nHuman Answerability to the World: John McDowell\u2019s Version of\nEmpiricism\u201d). \ufeffThis has implications for Rorty\u2019s\nview of the contribution of philosophy to intellectual progress:\n\u201cwhat matters in the end are changes in the vocabulary rather\nthan changes in belief, changes in truth-value candidates rather than\nassignments of truth-value\u201d (CIS, 47\u201348). As Rorty reads\nphilosophy, its significant achievements are not discoveries of the\ntruth or falsehood of certain propositions, but innovations in our\ndescriptive capacities \u2013 changes in what we are able to say and\nthink.\n2.3 Rationality, Science, and Truth\n\nAttacking the idea that we must acknowledge the world\u2019s\nnormative constraint on our belief-systems if we are to be rational\nsubjects, Rorty has drawn a great deal of criticism that takes\nscience, particularly natural science, as its chief reference point.\nTwo general kinds of criticisms are often raised. The first insists\nthat science consists precisely in the effort to learn the truth about\nhow things are by methodically allowing us to be constrained in our\nbeliefs by the world. On this view, Rorty is simply denying the very\nidea of science. The other kind of criticism seeks to be internal: if\nRorty\u2019s view of science were to prevail, scientists would no\nlonger be motivated to carry on as they are; science would cease to be\nthe useful sort of thing that Rorty also thinks it is (see, e.g.,\nBernard Williams, \u201cAuto da Fe\u201d in Malachowski, 1990).\nHowever, Rorty\u2019s view of science is more complicated than he\nhimself sometimes implies. He says: \u201cI tend to view natural\nscience as in the business of controlling and predicting things, and\nas largely useless for philosophical purposes\u201d (\u201cReply to\nHartshorne,\u201d Saatkamp, 32). Yet he spends a good deal of time\ndrawing an alternative picture of the intellectual virtues that good\nscience embodies (ORT, Part I). This is a picture which eschews the\nnotion that science succeeds, when it does, in virtue of being in\ntouch with reality in a special way, the sort of way that\nepistemologists, when successful, can clarify. It is in this sense\nspecifically that Rorty disavows science as philosophically\nsignificant. Good science may nevertheless be a model of rationality,\nin Rorty\u2019s view, exactly in so far as scientific practice has\nsucceeded in establishing institutions conducive to the democratic\nexchange of views.\n\nThe provocative and counterintuitive force of Rorty\u2019s treatment\nof rationality and science in terms of conversational ethics is\nundeniable. It is important to realize, though, that Rorty is not\ndenying that there is any bona fide use of notions like truth,\nknowledge, or objectivity. Rather his point is that our ordinary uses\nof these notions always trade for their content and point on\nparticular features of their varying contexts of application. His\nfurther point is that when we abstract away from these different\ncontexts and practices, in search of general notions, we are left with\npure abstract hypostatizations incapable of providing us with any\nguide to action at all. The upshot, Rorty holds, is that we simply do\nnot have a concept of objective reality which can be invoked either to\nexplain the success of some set of norms of warrant, or to justify\nsome set of standards over against others. This is perhaps clearest in\nRorty\u2019s treatment of the concept of truth. With regard to truth,\nRorty\u2019s rhetoric and philosophical strategy has indeed shifted\nover the last three decades. As late as in 1982 (in CP) he still\nattempts to articulate his view of truth by drawing on William\nJames\u2019s famous definition in terms of what is good in the way of\nbelief. Soon after this, however, Rorty comes to doubt the point of\nany theory of truth, and, following Davidson\u2019s lead, explicitly\nrejects all attempts to explicate the notion of truth in terms of\nother concepts. Rorty\u2019s mature view of the point and\nsignificance of the concept of truth is first elaborated in\n\u201cDavidson, Pragmatism and Truth\u201d (in ORT). Recent\nexpressions are found in the first of the two Spinoza Lectures given\nat the University of Amsterdam in 1997, \u201cIs it Desirable to Love\ntruth?\u201d, in the paper, \u201cIs Truth a Goal of Inquiry? Donald\nDavidson versus Crispin Wright\u201d (TP), as well as in the\nintroductions to, respectively, TP and PSH. In these writings, Rorty\nargues that while \u201ctruth\u201d has various important uses, it\ndoes not itself name a goal towards which we can strive, over and\nabove warrant or justification. His argument is not that truth is\nreducible to warrant, but that the concept has no deep or substantive\ncriterial content at all. That is, there are only semantic\nexplanations to be offered for why it is the case that a given\nsentence is true just when its truth conditions are satisfied. So\naiming for truth, as opposed to warrant, does not point to a possible\nline of action, just as we have no measure of our approximation to\ntruth other than increasing warrant. Indeed, for Rorty, this is part\nof what makes the concept so useful, in a manner not coincidentally\nanalogous with goodness; it ensures that no sentence can ever be\nanalytically certified as true by virtue of its possession of some\nother property. Rorty\u2019s attitude to the concept of truth has\nbeen much criticized, often on the grounds that the very notion of\nwarrant, indeed the concept of belief in general, presupposes the\nnotion of truth. However, it may be that we can do justice to these\nconnections without supposing that the notion of truth thus involved\nbacks up the notions of belief and warrant with any substantive\nnormative content of its own. Indeed, that neither the concept of\ntruth, nor those of objectivity and of reality, can be invoked to\nexplain or legitimate our inferential practices and our standards of\nwarrant, is the essence of Rorty\u2019s conversationalism, or\nepistemological behaviorism.\n3. Cultural Politics\n\nTaking epistemological behaviorism to heart, Rorty urges, means that\nwe can no longer construe the authority of science in terms of\nontological claims. Though many disagree, this is not, for Rorty, to\ndenigrate or weaken the authority of science. Indeed, a prominent\nfeature of Rorty\u2019s post-metaphysical, post-epistemological\nculture, is a thoroughgoing Darwinian naturalism.\n3.1 Naturalism\n\nTo be a naturalist in Rorty\u2019s sense,\n\n\nis to be the kind of antiessentialist who, like Dewey, sees no breaks\nin the hierarchy of increasingly complex adjustments to novel\nstimulation \u2013 the hierarchy which has amoeba adjusting\nthemselves to changed water temperature at the bottom, bees dancing\nand chess players check-mating in the middle, and people fomenting\nscientific, artistic, and political revolutions at the top. (ORT,\n109)\n\n\nIn Rorty\u2019s view, both Dewey\u2019s pragmatism and Darwinism\nencourage us to see vocabularies as tools to be assessed in terms of\nthe particular purposes they may serve. Our vocabularies, Rorty\nsuggests, \u201chave no more of a representational relation to an\nintrinsic nature of things than does the anteater\u2019s snout or the\nbowerbird\u2019s skill at weaving\u201d (TP, 48). Pragmatic\nevaluation of various linguistically infused practices requires a\ndegree of specificity. From Rorty\u2019s perspective, to suggest that\nwe might evaluate vocabularies with respect to their ability to\nuncover the truth would be like claiming to evaluate tools for their\nability to help us get what we want \u2013 full stop. Is the hammer\nor the saw or the scissors better \u2013 in general? Questions about\nusefulness can only be answered, Rorty points out, once we give\nsubstance to our purposes.\n\nRorty\u2019s pragmatist appropriation of Darwin also defuses the\nsignificance of reduction. He rejects as representationalist the sort\nof naturalism that implies a program of nomological or conceptual\nreduction to terms at home in a basic science. Rorty\u2019s\nnaturalism echoes Nietzsche\u2019s perspectivism; a descriptive\nvocabulary is valuable insofar as the patterns it highlights are\nusefully attended to by creatures with needs and interests like ours.\nDarwinian naturalism, for Rorty, implies that there is no one\nprivileged vocabulary whose purpose it is to serve as a critical\ntouchstone for our various descriptive practices.\n\nFor Rorty, then, any vocabulary, even that of evolutionary\nexplanation, is a tool for a purpose, and therefore subject to\nteleological assessment. Typically, Rorty justifies his own commitment\nto Darwinian naturalism by suggesting that this vocabulary is suited\nto further the secularization and democratization of society that\nRorty thinks we should aim for. Accordingly, there is a close tie\nbetween Rorty\u2019s construal of the naturalism he endorses and his\nmost basic political convictions.\n3.2 Ethnocentrism and Relativism\n\nOne result of Rorty\u2019s naturalism is that he is an avowed\nethnocentrist. If vocabularies are tools, then they are tools with a\nparticular history, having been developed in and by particular\ncultures. In using the vocabulary one has inherited, one is\nparticipating in and contributing to the history of that vocabulary\nand so cannot help but take up a position within the particular\nculture that has created it. As he puts it,\n\n\n\u2026one consequence of antirepresentationalism is the recognition\nthat no description of how things are from a God\u2019s-eye point of\nview, no skyhook provided by some contemporary or yet-to-be-developed\nscience, is going to free us from the contingency of having been\nacculturated as we were. Our acculturation is what makes certain\noptions live, or momentous, or forced, while leaving others dead, or\ntrivial, or optional. (ORT, 13)\n\n\nThis view looks to many readers like a version of cultural relativism.\nGranted, Rorty does not say that what is true, what is good, and what\nis right is relative to some particular ethnos, and so in that sense\nhe is no relativist. But the worry about relativism \u2013 that it\nleaves us with no rational way to adjudicate conflict \u2013 seems to\napply equally to Rorty\u2019s ethnocentric view. Rorty\u2019s answer\nis to say that in one sense of \u201crational\u201d that is true,\nbut that in another sense it is not, and to recommend that we drop the\nformer (TP, 186\u2013201). Rorty\u2019s position is that we have no\nnotion of rational warrant that exceeds, or transcends, or grounds,\nthe norms that liberal intellectuals take to define thorough,\nopen-minded, reflective discussion. It is chimerical, Rorty holds, to\nthink that the force or attractiveness of these norms can be enhanced\nby argument that does not presuppose them. It is pointless, equally,\nto look for ways of convicting those who pay them no heed of\nirrationality. Persuasion across such fundamental differences is\nachieved, if at all, by concrete comparisons of particular\nalternatives, by elaborate description and redescription of the kinds\nof life to which different practices conduce. In his own work,\nRorty\u2019s offers such comparisons, descriptions, and\nredescriptions, with the goal of making liberalism the most attractive\nalternative.\n3.3 Liberalism and Irony\n\nRorty is a self-proclaimed postmodernist bourgeois liberal\n(\u201cPostmodernist Bourgeois Liberalism,\u201d ORT). His\nliberalism is postmodernist because it does not depend on a\nmetanarrative according to which liberalism is the realization and\nembodiment of transcultural and ahistorical conceptions of rationality\nand morality. Rather, its institutions and practices are the lucky\nresult of a contingent history. His liberalism is bourgeois because\nthis contingent history includes economic conditions that make these\ninstitutions and practices possible (see section 3.7).\n\nThus, his liberalism is a pragmatic liberalism. He is skeptical of\npolitical thought purporting to uncover hidden, systematic causes for\ninjustice and exploitation, and on that basis proposing sweeping\nchanges to set things right. (ORT Part III; EHO; CIS Part II; AOC).\nRather, liberalism involves piecemeal reforms advancing economic\njustice and increasing the freedoms that citizens are able to enjoy.\nIt is also a romantic liberalism. He follows Judith Shklar in\nidentifying liberals by their belief that \u201ccruelty is the worst\nthing we do,\u201d and contends it is our ability to imagine the ways\nwe can be cruel to others, and how we could be different, that enables\nus to gradually expand the community with which we feel solidarity\n(CIS, 146).\n\nIt is possible, Rorty thinks, to be both a liberal and an ironist. The\nironist, a figure Rorty contrasts with \u201cthe\nmetaphysician,\u201d is a central character in CIS. The metaphysician\nis someone who adheres to the \u201ccommon sense\u201d view that it\nis possible to discover the true nature of reality or the true nature\nof the self, whereas the ironist is someone who understands that any\nparticular description of reality or of the self that she might adopt\nwill be adopted only for contingent reasons, often having to do with\nher culture and upbringing. Because she recognizes that the\ndescriptions she uses are optional, she is often on the lookout for\nnew ways of describing things, particularly when she \u201chas\nradical and continuing doubts about the final vocabulary she currently\nuses\u201d (CIS, 73). Because she believes \u201cthere is nothing\nbeyond vocabularies which serves as a criterion of choice between\nthem\u201d (CIS, 80), these doubts can only be resolved by comparing\nalternative possible vocabularies. Thus, she seeks out different and\ncompelling descriptions that she can adopt or incorporate into her own\nfinal vocabulary.\n\nRorty\u2019s liberal ironist, recognizing \u2013 indeed, affirming\n\u2013 the contingency of her own commitments, is explicitly\nethnocentric (ORT, \u201cSolidarity or Objectivity\u201d). She\naccepts that bourgeois liberalism has no universality other than the\ntransient and unstable one which time, luck, and discursive effort\nmight win for it. Recognizing the contingency of these values and the\nvocabulary in which they are expressed, while retaining the\ncommitments, is the attitude of the liberal ironist (CIS, essays 3,4).\nLiberal ironists have the ability to combine consciousness of the\ncontingency of their own evaluative vocabulary with a commitment to\nreducing suffering \u2013 in particular, with a commitment to\ncombatting cruelty (CIS, essay 4, ORT, Part III).\n3.4 Public and Private\n\nRorty\u2019s version of liberalism is expressed also in the\ndistinction he draws between the private and the public (CIS). This\ndistinction is often misinterpreted to imply that certain domains of\ninteraction or behavior should be exempted from evaluation in moral or\npolitical or social terms. The distinction Rorty draws, however, has\nlittle to do with traditional attempts to draw lines of demarcation of\nthis sort between a private and a public domain \u2013 to determine\nwhich aspects of our lives we do and which we don\u2019t have to\nanswer for publicly. Rorty\u2019s distinction, rather, goes to the\npurposes of theoretical vocabularies. We should, Rorty urges, be\n\u201ccontent to treat the demands of self-creation and of human\nsolidarity as equally valid, yet forever incommensurable\u201d (CIS,\nxv). Rorty\u2019s view is that we should treat vocabularies for\ndeliberation about public goods and social and political arrangements,\non the one hand, and vocabularies developed or created in pursuit of\npersonal fulfilment, self-creation, and self-realization, on the\nother, as distinct tools. The attempt to bring them together, in an\noverarching theory, is part of what has led philosophy to pursue\nprojects that have exceeded their usefulness.\n\nRorty\u2019s distinction between public and private is personified in\nthe figure of the liberal ironist (CIS, chapter 4). She is a person\nwho recognizes that her final vocabulary can be split into two parts,\nwhere the public part of her final vocabulary has to do with her\nresponsibilities to others (justice), and the private part of her\nfinal vocabulary has to do with her responsibilities to herself\n(self-creation). Arguably, the liberal ironist is the type of person\nRorty himself aspired to be, as evidenced by his autobiographical\nessay, \u201cTrotsky and the Wild Orchids\u201d (in PSH). There, he\nadmits that much of his early philosophical career had been an attempt\nto reconcile public and private, but he \u201cgradually decided that\nthe whole idea of holding reality and justice in a single vision had\nbeen a mistake\u201d (PSH, 12).\n\nCritics have often worried that Rorty\u2019s line between public and\nprivate simply reinscribes one of the most problematic features of\nliberalism. However, the line Rorty draws between public and private\nis necessarily porous; it is in part because of the move of private\nvocabularies to the public realm that social progress occurs.\n3.5 Redescription and Social Progress\n\nThe key imperative in Rorty\u2019s ethico-political agenda is the\ndeepening and widening of solidarity. Consistent with his\nethnocentrism, he distinguishes between \u201cus\u201d and\n\u201cthem,\u201d arguing that thinking of more and diverse people\nas \u201cone of us\u201d is the hallmark of social progress (CIS,\n191). Solidarity is brought about by gradual and contingent expansions\nof the scope of \u201cwe;\u201d it is created through the hard work\nof training our sympathies rather than through the recognition of\nantecedent criteria that stipulate what we have in common. We train\nour sympathies, Rorty thinks, by exposing ourselves to forms of\nsuffering we had previously overlooked. Thus, the task of the\nintellectual, with respect to social progress, is not to provide\nrefinements of social theory, but to sensitize us to the suffering of\nothers, and refine, deepen and expand our ability to identify with\nothers, to think of others as like ourselves in morally relevant ways.\n(EHO, Part III; CIS, Part III). The liberal ironist, in particular,\nsees \u201cenlarging our acquaintance\u201d (CIS, 80) as the only\nway to assuage the doubts she has about herself and her culture.\n\nThe task of achieving solidarity is, for Rorty, divided up between\nagents of love (or guardians of diversity) and agents of justice (or\nguardians of universality). Rorty writes,\n\n\nThe moral tasks of a liberal democracy are divided between the agents\nof love and the agents of justice. In other words, such a democracy\nemploys and empowers both connoisseurs of diversity and guardians of\nuniversality. The former insist that there are people out there whom\nsociety has failed to notice. They make these candidates for admission\nvisible by showing how to explain their odd behavior in terms of a\ncoherent, if unfamiliar, set of beliefs and desires \u2013 as opposed\nto explaining this behavior with terms like stupidity, madness,\nbaseness or sin. The latter, the guardians of universality, make sure\nthat once these people are admitted as citizens, once they have been\nshepherded into the light by the connoisseurs of diversity, they are\ntreated just like all the rest of us. (ORT, \u201cOn Ethnocentrism: A\nReply to Clifford Geertz\u201d 206)\n\n\nThis distinction between guardians of universality and guardians of\ndiversity corresponds to Rorty\u2019s distinction between\npropositions and vocabularies (see section 2.2). A change in our\nbeliefs may result from convincing argument that occurs at the\nintra-vocabulary level, within what Rorty earlier refers to as\n\u201cnormal discourse\u201d (PMN, 320). A change in what we\nperceive as interesting truth-value candidates occurs at the\ninter-vocabulary level, within \u201cabnormal discourse.\u201d\nAbnormal discourse, Rorty contends, can produce \u201canything from\nnonsense to intellectual revolution\u201d (PMN, 320). Which of these\nit will produce depends on whether the new descriptions offered up\ncatch on more broadly. Rorty identifies romanticism as the view that\nthe latter sort of change is the more significant one (CIS\n\u201cIntroduction,\u201d essay 1).\n\nThe guardians of diversity contribute to social progress by offering\nnew descriptions that the liberal ironist might find in her search for\nnew and compelling descriptions to adopt or incorporate into her own\nfinal vocabulary. In CIS, this role is attributed to strong poets and\nironist theorists on the one hand, and novelists and journalists, on\nthe other. Strong poets and ironist theorists, like Marcel Proust,\nFriedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, and Jacques Derrida, offer new\ndescriptions in their private attempts to achieve autonomy by getting\nout from under the final vocabularies they have inherited. Novelists,\nlike Vladimir Nabokov, George Orwell, Charles Dickens, Harriet Beecher\nStowe, and Radclyffe Hall, offer new descriptions that draw our\nattention to the suffering of previously-overlooked people and groups.\nThey contribute to social progress by pointing out \u201cconcrete\ncases of particular people ignoring the suffering of other particular\npeople\u201d (ORT, 79). Because reading novels is one of the best\nways to sensitize ourselves to the suffering experienced by others\n\u2013 to see that they have \u201cthe same tendency to bleed when\npricked\u201d (RR, 465) \u2013 Rorty thinks a liberal arts education\nis key to maintaining liberal democracy, and for strengthening a\nglobal human rights culture (\u201cHuman Rights, Rationality, and\nSentimentality\u201d in TP). In other essays, like \u201cFeminism\nand Pragmatism,\u201d the role of guardian of diversity is expanded\nto include prophetic thinkers, like Catharine A. MacKinnon and Marilyn\nFrye, who offer new descriptions in their public efforts to reduce\nsuffering.\n\nRorty ultimately refers to these methods for securing social progress\nas \u201ccultural politics.\u201d Cultural politics includes both\nnegative projects \u2013 abandoning words and descriptions that block\nour ability to sympathize with others \u2013 and positive projects\n\u2013 new ways of speaking that help us see that\n\u201cothers\u201d are \u201cjust like us,\u201d and therefore\ndeserve to be part of our moral community (\u201cCultural Politics\nand the Question of the Existence of God\u201d in PCP). Cultural\npolitics thus involves imagining and articulating utopian visions, a\ntask he contends falls naturally to the Left, which is, \u201cby\ndefinition, the party of hope. It insists that our nation remains\nunachieved\u201d (AOC, 14).\n3.6 Rorty\u2019s America\n\nRorty\u2019s utopian yearnings describe an America that has taken up\nhis proposal to replace theory with metaphor and universal moral\nprinciples with feelings of solidarity (\u201cLooking Backwards from\nthe Year 2096\u201d in PSH). He also argues that achieving solidarity\nrequires economic security; when our economic circumstances are such\nthat we are forced to choose between feeding our families and feeding\nstrangers, the community to which one is loyal will contract. In his\nwords,\n\n\nOur loyalty to \u2026 larger groups will, however, weaken, or even\nvanish altogether, when things get really tough. Then people whom we\nonce thought of as like ourselves will be excluded. Sharing food with\nimpoverished people down the street is natural and right in normal\ntimes, but perhaps not in a famine, when doing so amounts to\ndisloyalty to one\u2019s family. The tougher things get, the more\nties of loyalty to those near at hand tighten, and the more those to\neveryone else slacken. (PCP, 42)\n\n\nFollowing the pragmatist insight that beliefs are habits of action,\nRorty contends that to hold a belief simply means that one is inclined\nto act in certain ways and not in others. Thus, \u201cto believe that\nsomeone is \u2018one of us,\u2019 a member of our moral community,\nis to exhibit readiness to come to their assistance when they are in\nneed\u201d (Rorty 1996, 13). Thus \u201can answer to the question\n\u2018who are we?\u2019 which is to have any moral significance, has\nto be one which takes money into account\u201d (Rorty 1996, 14).\n\nThis helps to explain why Rorty calls for a return to the reformist\nLeft of the 1960s in America, when universities and unions found\ncommon cause. What Rorty calls the \u201ccultural Left\u201d \u2013\nthe contemporary, academic left \u2013 is plagued by two related\nproblems. First, it has ignored economic inequality (Rorty\u2019s\nshorthand for which is \u201cselfishness\u201d) and focused on\nother, identity-based forms of inequality (Rorty\u2019s shorthand for\nwhich is \u201csadism\u201d). While Rorty thinks attempting to\nameliorate racial and gender inequality is a laudable goal, he laments\nthe fact that this focus has displaced the focus on economic\ninequality. Second, Rorty worries that the cultural left tries to\ntheorize its way \u201cinto political relevance,\u201d and thereby\nadopts a \u201cspectatorial approach\u201d (AOC, 94). In so doing,\nit prioritizes knowledge over hope. Thus, Rorty enjoins the cultural\nLeft to abandon its spectatorial approach by abandoning theory and\nreviving its hope in the promise of America.\n\nA reinvigorated Left would have to reclaim the sort of pride in\nAmerica that animated the work of the reformist Left. Rorty opens\nAchieving Our Country (1998) by writing,\n\n\nNational pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a\nnecessary condition for self-improvement. Too much national pride can\nproduce bellicosity and imperialism, just as excessive self-respect\ncan produce arrogance. But just as too little self-respect makes it\ndifficult for a person to display moral courage, so insufficient\nnational pride makes energetic and effective debate about national\npolicy unlikely. (AOC, 3)\n\n\nWhile philosophical theorizing about America is a symptom of\nhopelessness, engaging in debates about what America can do and become\nrepresents a hopeful attitude that he thinks is required for social\nprogress.\n4. Rorty in the Conversations of Philosophy\n\nThe wide scope of Rorty\u2019s metaphilosophical deconstruction of\nrepresentationalism in PMN, together with a penchant for uncashed\nmetaphor and swift, broad-stroke historical narrative of the sort\ndisplayed in CP, earned Rorty a sturdy reputation as an\nanti-philosopher\u2019s philosopher. At the same time, however, as\nhis reputation within the dominant cultures of analytic philosophy was\nwaning in the wake of PMN, his writings from the 1980s in particular\ngained a significant readership beyond the confines of the profession.\nStill, while his academic engagement certainly ranged far beyond the\nconfines of analytic philosophy, it would be wrong to say that Rorty\nturned his back on that enterprise. The relationship, as we shall see\n\u2013 though both complicated and shifting over the decades \u2013\nhas continued to develop as Rorty\u2019s work is appropriated by new\ngenerations of readers.\n4.1 Critical Responses\n\nBy 1970, the year Rorty was promoted to full professor at Princeton,\nhe had made a name for himself in analytic philosophy. He had written\na series of original and often prescient essays (MLM) on issues then\nat the of center of professional attention, notably in philosophy of\nmind and metaphilosophy, and he had also edited the volume, The\nLinguistic Turn: Essays in Philosophical Method (1992). This\ncollection of papers by prominent contributors, framed by\nRorty\u2019s extensive introduction, received a great deal of\nattention and acclaim. It did much to cement the idea of a linguistic\nturn (Rorty attributes the notion to Gustav Bergman (Rorty 1992, xx))\nas a sea change in the history of philosophy.\n\nThroughout the 1970s Rorty\u2019s metaphilosophical papers prodded\nthe self-understanding of contemporary analytical philosophy,\nadvocating the relevance of American pragmatism, Wittgenstein, and\nthinkers in the European Continental tradition to the self-conception\nof post-positivist analytic philosophy. It is well documented that\nRorty became increasingly disenchanted with the practice of philosophy\nas it was conducted by the dominant figures in the Princeton\ndepartment during this period, and no doubt the feeling was\nreciprocated (Gross, 2008).\n\nNevertheless, within the philosophical community at large,\nRorty\u2019s standing was such that he was elected President of the\nEastern Division of the American Philosophical Association for the\nacademic year 1979\u20131980. Just weeks before he gave the\nPresidential Address (\u201cPragmatism, Relativism, and\nIrrationalism,\u201d see RR), however, PMN was published by Princeton\nUniversity Press. To Rorty\u2019s surprise (Rorty in Lewis-Kraus,\n2003), this monograph was read as an attack on the basic creed of\nanalytic philosophy as such, rather than as an attempt at benevolent\nreform. Most reviews were hostile to what was regarded as\nRorty\u2019s end-of-philosophy message, and in the years that\nfollowed, Rorty\u2019s challenge to representationalist epistemology\nwas in many influential quarters studiously ignored.\n\nIn retrospect, the hostility may appear excessive, but understandable.\nAs we have seen in connection with Rorty\u2019s attitude to science,\nit is particularly Rorty\u2019s treatment of truth and knowledge that\ndrew fire from philosophers. While a great variety of philosophers\nhave criticized Rorty on this general score in a great variety of\nways, a common concern stands out; Rorty\u2019s conversationalist\nview of truth and knowledge leaves us entirely unable to account for\nthe notion that a reasonable view of how things are is a view suitably\nconstrained by how the world actually is. This criticism is levelled\nagainst Rorty not only from the standpoint of metaphysical and\nscientific realist views of the sort that Rorty hoped would soon be\nextinct. It is expressed also by thinkers who respect Rorty\u2019s\ndialectical acumen, who have some sympathy with Rorty\u2019s\nhistoricist view of intellectual progress, and who find persuasive his\ncritique of Kantian and Platonist features of modern philosophy. John\nMcDowell (McDowell, 1994), for instance, claims that Rorty\u2019s\nview of the relation between agent and world as merely causal runs\nafoul of the notion that our very concept of a creature with beliefs\ninvolves the idea of a rational constraint of the world on our\nepistemic states. Pascal Engel, in his exchange with Rorty on the\nnotion of truth (Rorty and Engel, 2007), takes Rorty to task for\ngiving up the very notion that undergirds rational argument and\nconviction, without which it is hard to see what the remit of\nphilosophy might possibly be.\n\nHowever, critics are not concerned only with what they see as a\nmisguided view of belief, truth, and knowledge, whether relativist,\nsubjectivist, or idealist in nature. An important reason for the high\ntemperature of much of the debate that Rorty has inspired is that he\nappears to some to reject the very values that are the basis for any\narticulation of a philosophical view of truth and knowledge at all. As\nEngel emphasizes, Rorty is indeed critical of the role of argument in\nintellectual progress, and he is dismissive of the very idea of\ntheories of truth, of knowledge, of rationality, and the like.\nPhilosophers such as Hilary Putnam and Susan Haack, who shared\nRorty\u2019s view that analytic philosophy would do well to\nincorporate the lessons of American pragmatism, focused their\ncriticisms on exactly this aspect of Rorty\u2019s views. Haack, in\nparticular, frames her attacks on Rorty along these lines in moral\nterms; to her mind, Rorty\u2019s efforts to abandon the basic\nconcepts of traditional epistemology are symptoms of a vulgar\ncynicism, which contributes to the decline of reason and intellectual\nintegrity that Haack and others find to be characteristic of much\ncontemporary thought. The charge of intellectual irresponsibility is\nsometimes raised, or at last implied, in connection with Rorty\u2019s\nuse of historical figures. Rorty\u2019s reading of Descartes and of\nKant in PMN have often been challenged, as has his more constructive\nuses of Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein. The kind of\nappropriation of other writers and thinkers that Rorty performs will\nat times seem to do violence to the views and intentions of the\nprotagonists. Rorty, however, is quite clear about the rhetorical\npoint and scholarly limitations of these kinds of redescriptions, as\nhe explains in \u201cThe Historiography of Philosophy: Four\nGenres\u201d (Rorty, 1984).\n4.2 Claim to Pragmatism\n\nRorty\u2019s reading of earlier philosophers has always been\nunabashedly appropriative, and hence often controversial. His\nheterodox reading of Dewey and his generally dismissive attitude\ntoward Peirce has also meant that Rorty found few friends among the\nkeepers of the pragmatist tradition in the American academy. Prominent\nreaders of the classical American pragmatists have expressed deep\nreservations about Rorty\u2019s interpretation of Dewey and Peirce,\nin particular, and of his construal of the pragmatist movement in\ngeneral (see, for instance, Misak, 2013.) Consequently, Rorty\u2019s\nentitlement to the label \u201cpragmatist\u201d has been challenged.\nHaack\u2019s strong claims on this score are notable, but there are\nmany others. (See the discussions of Rorty in Alexander, 1987;\nBrodsky, 1982; Campbell, 1984; Edel, 1985; Gouinlock, 1995; Lavine\n1995; R.W: Sleeper, 1986; as well as the essays in Langsdorf and\nSmith, 1995.) For Rorty, the key figure in the American pragmatist\nmovement is John Dewey, to whom he attributes many of his own central\ndoctrines. In particular, Rorty finds in Dewey an anticipation of his\nown view of philosophy as the facilitator of a humanist politics, of a\nnon-ontological view of the virtues of inquiry, of a holistic\nconception of human intellectual life, and of an anti-essentialist,\nhistoricist conception of philosophical thought. To read Dewey his\nway, however, Rorty explicitly sets about separating the\n\u201cgood\u201d from the \u201cbad\u201d Dewey (see\n\u201cDewey\u2019s Metaphysics\u201d in CP, and \u201cDewey\nbetween Hegel and Darwin\u201d in TP). He is critical of what he\ntakes to be Dewey\u2019s backsliding into metaphysics in\nExperience and Nature, and has no patience for the\nconstructive attempt of Logic: The Theory of Inquiry. Rorty\nthus imposes a scheme of evaluation on Dewey\u2019s works which many\nscholars object to. Lavine, for one, claims that \u201cscientific\nmethod\u201d is Dewey\u2019s central concept (Lavine 1995, 44).\nSleeper holds that reform rather than elimination of metaphysics and\nepistemology is Dewey\u2019s aim (Sleeper 1986, 2, chapter 6).\n\nRorty\u2019s least favourite pragmatist is Peirce, whom he regards as\nsubject to both scheme-content dualism and to a degree of scientism.\nSo it is not surprising that Haack, whose own pragmatism draws\ninspiration from Peirce, finds Rorty\u2019s recasting of pragmatism\nliterally unworthy of the name. From Haack\u2019s perspective,\nRorty\u2019s opposition to the epistemological orientation of modern\nphilosophy breaks fundamentally with the American pragmatists, in so\nfar as he dismisses the very project that gave direction to their\nwork. While classical pragmatism is an attempt to understand and work\nout a novel legitimating framework for scientific inquiry, Haack\nmaintains, Rorty\u2019s \u201cpragmatism\u201d (Haack consistently\nuses quotes) is simply an abandonment of the very attempt to learn\nmore about the nature and adequacy conditions of inquiry. Instead of\naiding us in our aspiration to govern ourselves through rational\nthought, Rorty weakens our intellectual resilience and leaves us even\nmore vulnerable to rhetorical seduction. To Haack and her\nsympathisers, Rorty\u2019s pragmatism is dangerous, performing an\nend-run on reason, and therefore on philosophy. Cheryl Misak, who is\none of the most influential voices among contemporary pragmatists, and\nwho also shares Haack\u2019s enthusiasm for Peirce, criticizes Rorty\nalong similar lines. When Rorty abandons the notion of objectivity,\nMisak argues, he also dispenses with the capacity for normative\ncritique (Misak, 2013). Rorty, from this perspective, ends up with a\npragmatism of subjectivity in the tradition of William James.\n4.3 Analytic Philosophy\n\nRorty is sometimes portrayed as a renegade, as someone who went\nthrough a transformation from bona fide analytical philosopher to\nsomething else, and then lived to tell a tale of liberation from\nyouthful enchantment. This portrayal, however, distorts both\nRorty\u2019s view of analytical philosophy and the trajectory of his\nthinking. Indeed, Rorty\u2019s relationship to the traditions of\nWestern philosophy is more nuanced than his reputation might suggest.\nSo, too, is his relation to analytical philosophy in particular.\n\nThough the introduction to the 1967 volume on the linguistic turn\n(Rorty, 1992) and the early papers in philosophy of mind from the\n1960s do show Rorty adopting frameworks for philosophical problems\nthat he later dispenses with, these writings at the same time very\nclearly bear the mark of the fundamental metaphilosophical attitude\nwhich becomes increasingly explicit in the next decade (see Stephen\nLeach and James Tartaglia, \u201cIntroduction,\u201d MLM\n1\u201315). In the Preface to PMN, referring to Hartshorne, McKeon,\nCarnap, Robert Brumbaugh, Carl Hempel, and Paul Weiss, Rorty says,\n\n\nI was very fortunate in having these men as my teachers, but, for\nbetter or worse, I treated them all as saying the same thing: that a\n\u201cphilosophical problem\u201d was a product of the unconscious\nadoption of a set of assumptions built into the vocabulary in which\nthe problem was stated \u2013 assumptions which were to be questioned\nbefore the problem itself was taken seriously. (PMN, xiii)\n\n\nThis way of stating the lesson, however, appears to leave open the\npossibility that certain philosophical problems eventually may\nlegitimately be taken seriously \u2013 that is, at face value in the\nsense that they require constructive solutions \u2013 provided the\nassumptions which sustain their formulation stand up to proper\ncritical scrutiny. Taken this way, the attitude Rorty here expresses\nwould be more or less the same as that of all those philosophers who\nhave diagnosed their predecessors\u2019 work as mixtures of\npseudo-questions and genuine problems dimly glimpsed, problems which\nnow, with the proper frame of questioning fully clarified, may be\nproductively addressed. But the full force of the lesson Rorty learned\nemerges only with the view that this notion of proper critical\nscrutiny is questionable. For Rorty, to legitimate the assumptions on\nwhich a philosophical problem is based would be to establish that the\nterms we require to pose that problem are really mandatory, that the\nvocabulary in which we encounter the problem is in principle\ninescapable. But Rorty\u2019s construal of the linguistic turn, as\nwell as his proposals for eliminating the vocabulary of the mental,\nare really at odds with the idea that we might hope to construct a\ndefinitive vocabulary for philosophy. Even in his early days,\nRorty\u2019s approach to philosophy is shaped by the historicist\nconviction that no vocabulary is inescapable in principle. This means\nthat progress in philosophy is gained less from constructive solutions\nto problems than through therapeutic dissolution of their causes, that\nis, through the invention of new vocabularies achieved by the launch\nof new and fruitful metaphors (\u201cIntroduction\u201d in PMN;\n\u201cUnfamiliar Noises: Hesse and Davidson on Metaphor\u201d in\nORT).\n\nTo hold that no vocabulary is final is also to hold that no vocabulary\ncan be free of unthematized yet optional assumptions. Hence any effort\nto circumvent a philosophical problem by making such assumptions\nvisible is subject to its own circumvention. Accordingly, the fact\nthat Rorty often distances himself from the terms in which he earlier\nframed arguments and made diagnoses is in itself no reason to impose\non him, as some have done, a temporal dichotomy. It may be that\nRorty\u2019s early work, inspired by a less critical, less\ndialectical reading of Quine and Sellars than that offered in PMN, is\nmore constructive than therapeutic in tone and jargon, and therefore\nfrom Rorty\u2019s later perspective in an important sense misguided.\nHowever, what ties together all Rorty\u2019s work, over time and\nacross themes, is his complete lack of faith in the idea that there is\nan ideal vocabulary, one which contains all genuine discursive\noptions. Rorty designates this faith Platonism (an important theme in\nCIS). That there are no inescapable forms of description is a thought\nwhich permeates Rorty\u2019s work from the 1960s through his later\ntherapeutic articulations of pragmatism right up until his\ncharacterization of philosophy as cultural politics (PCP).\nCharacterizations of pragmatism in terms of anti-foundationalism\n(PMN), of anti-representationalism (ORT), and of anti-essentialism\n(TP) are all explicitly parasitic on constructive efforts in\nepistemology and metaphysics, and are intended to highlight the\nvarious ways these efforts remain under the spell of a Platonic faith\nin ideal concepts and mandatory forms of descriptions.\n\nRorty\u2019s use of Quine and Sellars to make his fundamental points\nagainst the idea of philosophy as a knowledge legitimation project, as\nwell as his articulation of his critique in terms of typically\n\u201canalytical\u201d philosophical problems, has contributed to an\nimpression of PMN as an internal indictment of analytic philosophy as\nsuch. Many \u2013 some gleeful, some chagrined \u2013 have read PMN\nas a purported demonstration of the bankruptcy of one of the two\ncontemporary main streams of Western philosophy. Such readers draw\nsupport for this view also from the fact that much of Rorty\u2019s\nwritings since PMN have been concerned to show the virtues in thinkers\nlike Heidegger and Derrida (EHO). Forty years later, however, it seems\nunwise to superimpose the analytic-continental divide onto the message\nof PMN, or onto Rorty. In PMN, his central point is that philosophy\nneeds to break free from the metaphor of mind as a medium of\nappearances, appearances that philosophy must help us sort into the\nmere and the reality-corresponding ones. Rorty made this point in a\nvocabulary that was developed by Anglo-American (whether by birth,\nnaturalization, or late adoption) philosophers in the course of the\npreceding half-century. It is not necessary, and probably misleading,\nto see Rorty\u2019s criticism of epistemology and the assumptions\nthat make it appear worthwhile as a criticism of a particular\nphilosophical style of philosophy or set of methodological habits.\nReading PMN in conjunction with the essays in CP (see particularly\nessay 4, \u201cProfessionalized Philosophy and Transcendentalist\nCulture\u201d, essay 12, \u201cPhilosophy in America Today\u201d,\nand also \u201cIntroduction\u201d), one quickly sees that the target\nof PMN cannot be a putative school or branch of the subject called\n\u201cAnalytic Philosophy.\u201d Because Rorty thinks philosophy has\nno essence, has no defining historical task, fails to mark out a\nspecial domain of knowledge, and is not, in short, a natural kind (CP,\n226), he leaves no ground from which to level that sort of critique.\nNor is it his intention to do so. Around the time of the publication\nof PMN, Rorty\u2019s view of the matter was \u201cthat\n\u2018analytic philosophy\u2019 now has only a stylistic and\nsociological unity\u201d (CP, 217). He then qualifies this point as\nfollows: \u201cIn saying [this], I am not suggesting that analytic\nphilosophy is a bad thing, or is in bad shape. The analytic style is,\nI think, a good style. The esprit de corps among\nanalytic philosophers is healthy and useful\u201d (CP, 217). However,\nwhile Rorty apparently bears no prejudice against analytic philosophy\nin particular, the very reason for his tolerance \u2013 his\nantiessentialist, historicist view of philosophy and its problems\n\u2013 has for many critics been a point of objection. After his\nfaint praise, Rorty goes on:\n\n\nAll I am saying is that analytic philosophy has become, whether it\nlikes it or not, the same sort of discipline as we find in the other\n\u201chumanities\u201d departments \u2013 departments where\npretensions to \u201crigor\u201d and to \u201cscientific\u201d\nstatus are less evident. The normal form of life in the humanities is\nthe same as that in the arts and in belles-lettres; a genius does\nsomething new and interesting and persuasive, and his or her admirers\nbegin to form a school or movement. (CP, 217\u2013218)\n\n\nThis is perfectly consonant with the attitude to the notion of\nphilosophical method Rorty expresses 20 years later: \u201cSo-called\nmethods are simply descriptions of the activities engaged in by the\nenthusiastic imitators of one or another original mind \u2013 what\nKuhn would call the \u201dresearch programs\u201c to which their\nworks gave rise\u201d (TP, 10). Rorty\u2019s metaphilosophical\ncritique, then, is directed not at particular techniques or styles or\nvocabularies, but toward the idea that philosophical problems are\nanything other than transient tensions in the dynamics of evolving,\ncontingent vocabularies. If his critique has bite specifically against\nanalytic philosophy, this may be because of a lingering faith in\nphilosophical problems as lasting intellectual challenges that any\nhonest thinker has to acknowledge, and which may be met by making\nprogress in methodology. Rorty himself, however, nowhere says that\nthis faith is part of the essence of analytical philosophy. On the\ncontrary, it is clear that pioneering analytical philosophers, people\nlike Sellars, Quine, and Davidson, provided Rorty with indispensable\ncritical tools in his attack on the epistemological\nlegitimation-project that has been a central concern in philosophy\nsince Descartes.\n\nShorn of the ambition to make progress on perpetual problems,\nphilosophy in the analytic tradition remains a dynamic enterprise, as\nRorty\u2019s own work demonstrates. It is true that Rorty, as a\nprofessor of the humanities at the University of Virginia, found a\nlarger intellectual audience outside philosophy departments, as he\nincreasingly turned to literary theory and to political thought.\nHowever, while drawing on sources outside the analytic tradition and\nalso outside the field of philosophy, Rorty never ceased to engage\nwith analytic philosophy, and he retained a significant audience among\nAnglophone philosophers critical of the resurgence of metaphysics\nbrought on by the seminal work of Saul Kripke. A slow but persistent\nresurgence and rearticulation of pragmatic naturalism beginning in the\n1990s, gaining force after the turn of the millennium, provided new\nperspectives on Rorty and on the dialectical role of his\nmetaphilosophical critique.\n\nIn the years since Rorty\u2019s death, the publication of monographs\nand anthologies dedicated to his thought suggests that interest in\nRorty\u2019s contributions is on the rise in the world of Anglophone\nphilosophy. The tone of these critical appraisals is generally\ndifferent from the frequently harsh responses to the slayer of\nrepresentationalist epistemology that appeared during the 1980s.\nPerceptions of Rorty\u2019s critique have clearly softened; recent\ncommentators appear less concerned to defend the epistemological\nenterprise, and more interested in coming to terms with Rorty\u2019s\ncritique and to understand it in historical perspective. Moreover,\nRorty\u2019s work is increasingly being addressed as a contribution\nto political thought, with attention shifting away from\nmeta-epistemology and on to Rorty\u2019s vision and defense of\nliberalism, his distinctive conception of social progress, and his\nassessments of the prospects of reform toward greater social justice.\nWhile his attack on representationalism gained Rorty notoriety as a\nmetaphilosophical nihilist, the legacy that is now taking shape tends\nrather to highlight Rorty\u2019s fundamental and enduring concern\nwith the connection between philosophical thinking and the pursuit of\nhuman happiness, thus making a place for Rorty\u2019s voice in a\nconversation that springs from the founding impulses of Western\nphilosophy.\n",
