    "main_text": "\n\nJames of Viterbo (c. 1255\u20131308) is one of a number of highly\nsignificant theologians who were active in the last quarter of the\nthirteenth century, alongside Godfrey of Fontaines, Henry of Ghent and\nGiles of Rome, three authors whose views he constantly discusses and\nwith whom he often disagrees. Though decidedly influenced by the work\nand outlook of St. Augustine, James was very much an independent\nthinker, whose originality was fuelled by his attentive reading of the\nGreek and Arabic commentators on Aristotle. On several issues, such as\ncognition, the love of self over God, the relation between the\nspiritual and temporal powers, James held strikingly original and\noften controversial positions.\n",
