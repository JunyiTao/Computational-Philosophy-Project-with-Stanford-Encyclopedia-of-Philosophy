    "main_text": "The Dutch Book Argument and Probabilistic Consistency || The Dutch Book Argument as Revealing Inconsistency\n2.1 The Dutch Book Argument as Revealing Inconsistency\n\nA popular response to the objections to the DBA considered in section\none suggests that incoherence is not a pragmatic defect per se, and\nthat the Dutch Book is merely a dramatic device for illustrating a\nkind of logical defect. Skyrms (1987) attributes this reading of the\nDBA to Ramsey, finding support in his remarks that\n\nAny definite set of degrees of belief which broke them [the laws of\nprobability] would be inconsistent in the sense that it violated the\nlaws of preference between options\u2026If anyone\u2019s mental\ncondition violated these laws, his choice would depend on the precise\nform in which the options were offered him, which would be absurd. He\ncould have a book made against him by a cunning bettor and would stand\nto lose in any event. (Ramsey 1926, p. 41)\n\n\nAdditional support for this interpretation can be found in\nRamsey\u2019s assertion that the subject of his paper is the\nlogic of partial belief.\n\nMany authors, including Armendt (1993), Christensen (1996, 2004),\nHellman (1997), Howson and Urbach (1993), and more recently, Briggs\n(2009) and Mahtani (2015),  have endorsed and elaborated upon the\nidea that violation of the probability axioms amounts to a kind of\ninconsistency. For example, Armendt (1993) tells us that it involves\nan inconsistency that is revealed by the fact that degrees of belief\nguide action, and that Dutch Book vulnerability amounts to giving\nconflicting evaluations to the same option(s). He calls this\n\u201cdivided-mind\u201d inconsistency, which he says is a flaw of\nrationality. This fits the typical sort of case where an agent\nviolates additivity, and sometimes applies to violations of the other\naxioms, but incoherence does not always entail having two different\nevaluations of the same option. Although degrees of belief often serve\nas guides to action, they need not be tied to an evaluation of options\nat all. However, it is a fundamental assumption of most versions of\nthe DBA that credences do have such a role, as in the theories of\nRamsey and de Finetti, so it is of interest that even with this\nassumption, incoherence need not involve giving conflicting\nevaluations (Vineberg 2001). Consider for instance a person who is\nless than fully confident of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, perhaps\nbecause they don\u2019t know that it has been proven. On at least\nsome ways of understanding propositions, this need not entail\nattaching two different judgments to the same proposition. One could\nalso violate coherence by only attaching a probability of less than\none to a single proposition that is a logical truth, or one could\navoid different evaluations by having the same level of confidence in\nevery proposition. These examples aside, even the additivity axiom is\nproblematic on Armendt\u2019s interpretation, for it requires, for\nmutually exclusive propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\),\nthat joint bets on \\(p\\) and on \\(q\\)\namount to the same option as a bet on \\(p\\)\nor \\(q\\). This in turn presumes that\nvalues are additive, which goes beyond simply having degrees of\nconfidence in \\(p, q\\), and their disjunction, although Armendt (1993)\nsuggests that the assumption is generally met and appropriate for the\npurposes of the DBA.\n\nIn \u201cTruth and Probability\u201d, Ramsey assumes that, at least\nunder idealized conditions, degrees of belief manifest themselves in\npreferences for options. This allows Ramsey to characterize the\ninconsistency involved in violating the probability axioms in terms of\nviolating the axioms of rational preference. While he never claims\nthat degrees of belief are necessarily linked to preferences, the\nmodel of belief and preference that he offers assumes such an\nassociation, and indeed a great achievement of the paper is what\namounts to a representation theorem establishing that an agent\nsatisfying the axioms that he specifies for rational preference can be\nrepresented as having degrees of belief that satisfy the probability\naxioms. In the model he offers, degrees of belief serve as guides to\naction through their connection with preferences, so that therein at\nleast incoherence does manifest itself in preference\ninconsistency. But the way that Ramsey casts the inconsistency\ninvolved in violating the axioms in terms of preference inconsistency\nleaves it unclear that his goal of characterizing the logic of partial\nbelief has been satisfactorily met. One trouble is that it does not\nshow us that the preference inconsistency to which incoherent beliefs\nare tied is appropriately analogous to inconsistency for simple (or\nfull) belief, which involves believing inconsistent propositions, i.e.\na set of propositions that cannot all be true. Another worry is that\nin Ramsey\u2019s model degrees of belief are linked with preferences,\nand it seems that having a degree of belief does not by its nature\nrequire any such connection with preference and action. One can surely\nhave finely graded beliefs in propositions without those beliefs being\nconnected to preferences.  Moreover, consistency for full belief\nderives from the concept of belief as holding propositions to be true\nand from the logic of propositions, without any such assumed tie to\naction, and although Ramsey thought that such a connection was\nnecessary to clarify the idea of partial belief, it seems that a fully\nanalogous characterization of consistency for partial belief should do\nwithout it.  \n",
