    "main_text": "Compounds of Conditionals: Problems for the Suppositional Theory\n6. Other Conditional Speech Acts and Propositional Attitudes\n\nAs well as conditional beliefs, there are conditional desires, hopes,\nfears, etc.. As well as conditional statements, there are conditional\ncommands, questions, offers, promises, bets, etc.. \u201cIf he\ncalls\u201d plays the same role in \u201cIf he calls, what shall I\nsay?\u201d, \u201cIf he calls, tell him I\u2019m out\u201d and\n\u201cIf he calls, Mary will be pleased\u201d. Which of our theories\nextends to these other kinds of conditional? \n\nOne believes that \\(B\\) to the extent that one thinks \\(B\\) more\nlikely than not \\(B\\); according to Supp, one believes that \\(B\\) if\n\\(A\\) to the extent that one believes that \\(B\\) under the supposition\nthat \\(A\\), i.e. to the extent that one thinks \\(A \\amp B\\) more\nlikely than \\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\); and there is no proposition \\(X\\) such\nthat one must believe \\(X\\) more likely than \\({\\sim}X\\), just to the\nextent that one believes \\(A \\amp B\\) more likely than \\(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B\\). Conditional desires appear to be like conditional\nbeliefs: to desire that \\(B\\) is to prefer \\(B\\) to \\({\\sim}B\\); to\ndesire that \\(B\\) if \\(A\\) is to prefer \\(A \\amp B\\) to \\(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B\\); there is no proposition \\(X\\) such that one prefers\n\\(X\\) to \\({\\sim}X\\) just to the extent that one prefers \\(A \\amp B\\)\nto \\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\). I have entered a competition and have a very\nsmall chance of winning. I express the desire that if I win the prize\n\\((W)\\), you tell Fred straight away \\((T)\\). I prefer \\(W \\amp T\\) to\n\\(W \\amp{\\sim}T\\). I do not necessarily prefer \\((W \\supset T)\\) to\n\\({\\sim}(W \\supset T)\\), i.e. \\(({\\sim}W\\) or \\(W \\amp T)\\) to \\(W\n\\amp{\\sim}T\\). For I also want to win the prize, and much the most\nlikely way for \\(({\\sim}W\\) or \\(W \\amp T)\\) to be true is that I\ndon\u2019t win the prize. Nor is my conditional desire satisfied if I\ndon\u2019t win but in the nearest possible world in which I win, you\ntell Fred straight away.\n\nIf I believe that \\(B\\) if \\(A\\), i.e. (according to Supp) think \\(A\n\\amp B\\) much more likely than \\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\), this puts me in a\nposition to make a conditional commitment to \\(B\\): to assert that\n\\(B\\), conditionally upon \\(A\\). If \\(A\\) is found to be true, my\nconditional assertion has the force of an assertion of \\(B\\). If \\(A\\)\nis false, there is no proposition that I asserted. I did, however,\nexpress my conditional belief \u2014 it is not as though I said\nnothing. Suppose I say \u201cIf you press that switch, there will be\nan explosion\u201d, and my hearer takes me to have made a conditional\nassertion of the consequent, one which will have the force of an\nassertion of the consequent if she presses the button. Provided she\ntakes me to be trustworthy and reliable, she thinks that if she\npresses the switch, the consequent is likely to be true. That is, she\nacquires a reason to think that if she presses it, there will be an\nexplosion; and hence a reason not to press it.\n\nConditional commands can, likewise, be construed as having the force\nof a command of the consequent, conditional upon the\nantecedent\u2019s being true. The doctor says to the nurse in the\nemergency ward, \u201cIf the patient is still alive in the morning,\nchange the dressing\u201d. Considered as a command to make\nHook\u2019s conditional true, this is equivalent to \u201cMake it\nthe case that either the patient is not alive in the morning, or you\nchange the dressing\u201d. The nurse puts a pillow over the\npatient\u2019s face and kills her. On the truth-functional\ninterpretation, the nurse can claim that he was carrying out the\ndoctor\u2019s order. Extending Jackson\u2019s account to conditional\ncommands, the doctor said \u201cMake it the case that either the\npatient is not alive in the morning, or you change the\ndressing\u201d, and indicated that she would still command this if\nshe knew that the patient would be alive. This doesn\u2019t help. The\nnurse who kills the patient still carried out an order. Why should the\nnurse be concerned with what the doctor would command in a\ncounterfactual situation?\n\nHook will reply to the above argument about conditional commands that\nwe need to appeal to pragmatics. Typically, for any command,\nconditional or not, there are tacitly understood reasonable and\nunreasonable ways of obeying it; and killing the patient is to be\ntacitly understood as a totally unreasonable way of making the\ntruth-functional conditional true \u2014 as, indeed, would be\nchanging the dressing in such an incompetent way that you almost\nstrangle the patient in the process. The latter clearly is obeying the\ncommand, but not in the intended manner. But it is stretching\npragmatics rather far to say the same of the former. To take a less\ndramatic example, at Fred\u2019s request, the Head of Department\nagrees to bring it about that he gives the Kant lectures if his\nappointment is extended. She then puts every effort into making sure\nthat his appointment is not extended. Is it plausible to say that this\nis doing what she was asked to do, albeit not in the intended way?\n\nExtending Stalnaker\u2019s account to conditional commands, \u201cIf\nit rains, take your umbrella\u201d becomes \u201cIn the nearest\npossible world in which it rains, take your umbrella\u201d. Suppose I\nhave forgotten your command or alternatively am inclined to disregard\nit. However, it doesn\u2019t rain. In the nearest world in which it\nrains, I don\u2019t take my umbrella. On Stalnaker\u2019s account, I\ndisobeyed you. Similarly for conditional promises: on this analysis I\ncould break my promise to go to the doctor if the pain gets worse,\neven if the pain gets better. This is wrong: conditional commands and\npromises are not requirements on my behaviour in other possible\nworlds.\n\nAmong conditional questions we can distinguish those in which the\naddressee is presumed to know whether the antecedent is true, and\nthose in which he is not. In the latter case, the addressee is being\nasked to suppose that the antecedent is true, and give his opinion\nabout the consequent: \u201cIf it rains, will the match be\ncancelled?\u201d. In the former case \u2014 \u201cIf you have been\nto London, did you like it?\u201d \u2014 he is expected to answer\nthe consequent-question if the antecedent is true. If the antecedent\nis false, the question lapses: there is no conditional belief for him\nto express. \u201cNot applicable\u201d as the childless might write\non a form which asks \u201cIf you have children, how many children do\nyou have?\u201d. You are not being asked how many children you have\nin the nearest possible world in which you have children. Nor is it\npermissible to answer \u201c17\u201d on the grounds that \u201cI\nhave children \\(\\supset\\) I have 17 children\u201d is true. Nor are\nyou being asked what you would believe about the consequent if you\ncame to believe that you did have children.\n\nWidening our perspective to include these other conditionals tends to\nconfirm Supp\u2019s view. Any propositional attitude can be held\ncategorically, or under a supposition. Any speech act can be performed\nunconditionally, or conditionally upon something else. Our uses of\n\u201cif\u201d, on the whole, seem to be better and more uniformly\nexplained without invoking conditional propositions.\n",
