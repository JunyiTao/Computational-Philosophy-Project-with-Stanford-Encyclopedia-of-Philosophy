These papers advance theses\nthat Alexander would expand on in Space, Time, and Deity\n(1920).\n\nIn \u201cThe Basis of Realism\u201d (1914), Alexander rejects\nidealism in favour of realism. He writes that the \u201ctemper\u201d\nof realism is to de-anthropomorphise: to put man and mind in their\nproper places in the world of things. Whilst mind is properly\nunderstood as part of nature, this does not diminish its value\n(Alexander 1914: 279\u201380). For Alexander, realism is thus\nnaturalistic. This paper is an expansion of Alexander\u2019s less\nrigorous (1909\u201310), where he compares the new conception of mind\nas a mere part of the universe\u2014as opposed to being at the centre\nof the universe\u2014to the move from geocentrism to\nheliocentrism.\n\nA key part of Alexander\u2019s view is that minds exist in the world\nalongside other things. Minds are \u201ccompresent\u201d with other\nobjects in the world, such as tables and mountains. In fact, all\nexistents are compresent with each other:\n\n\nThere is nothing peculiar in the relation itself between mind and its\nobjects; what is peculiar in the situation is the character of one of\nthe terms, its being mind or consciousness. The relation is one of\ncompresence. But there is compresence between two physical things. The\nrelation of mind and object is comparable to that between table and\nfloor. (Alexander 1914: 288)\n\n\nAccording to Alexander, we perceive the world directly: we do not\nperceive representations or ideas of tables, but the tables themselves\n(or aspects of the tables). We are conscious of our\nperceptual process, a consciousness he labels\n\u201cenjoyment\u201d. Any direct theory of perception must account\nfor error. If we perceive the world directly, how do we make\nmistakes about it? Alexander\u2019s answer is that we do not perceive\nthe world incorrectly, but we can incorrectly apply partial\nperceptions to wholes. For example, we may correctly perceive a table\nas having a flat edge, but incorrectly apply that perception to\nthe table as a whole.\n\nAlexander also argues here that minds emerge from lower-level living\norganisms, and are no less real for it:\n\n\n[M]ind, though descended on its physical side from lower forms of\nexistence, is, when it comes, a new quality in the world, and no more\nceases to be original because in certain respects it is resoluble into\nphysical motions, than colour disappears because it is resoluble into\nvibrations. (Alexander 1914: 304)\n\n\nThe biology that informed Alexander\u2019s early (1889) work on\nethics survives in his account of mind: mind emerges in the world\nthrough evolution. This theory of \u201cemergent evolution\u201d is\nakin to that advanced by C. Lloyd Morgan; Alexander later references\nMorgan\u2019s Instinct and Experience (1912). Alexander\nadds here that the lowest level of existence is space and\ntime\u2014that they are \u201cthe foundation of all\nreality\u201d\u2014and he greatly expands on this view in his book\n(1920).\n\nOn Alexander\u2019s realism, including the motivations underlying\nit and the question of whether realism can be found in his\nearliest work, see Weinstein (1984), Fisher (2017; 2021b),\nand Thomas (2021). \n",
