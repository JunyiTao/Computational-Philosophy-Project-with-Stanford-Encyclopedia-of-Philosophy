    "main_text": "Varieties of Dualism: Interaction || Epiphenomenalism\n3.2 Epiphenomenalism\n\n\nIf the reality of property dualism is not to be denied, but the\nproblem of how the immaterial is to affect the material is to be\navoided, then epiphenomenalism may seem to be the answer. According to\nthis theory, mental events are caused by physical events, but have no\ncausal influence on the physical. I have introduced this theory as if\nits point were to avoid the problem of how two different categories of\nthing might interact. In fact, it is, at best, an incomplete solution\nto this problem. If it is mysterious how the non-physical can have it\nin its nature to influence the physical, it ought to be equally\nmysterious how the physical can have it in its nature to produce\nsomething non-physical. But that this latter is what occurs is an\nessential claim of epiphenomenalism. (For development of this point,\nsee Green (2003), 149\u201351). In fact, epiphenomenalism is more effective\nas a way of saving the autonomy of the physical (the world as\n\u2018closed under physics\u2019) than as a contribution to avoiding the\nneed for the physical and non-physical to have causal commerce.\n\n\nThere are at least three serious problems for epiphenomenalism.\nFirst, as I indicated in section 1, it is profoundly\ncounterintuitive. What could be more apparent than that it is the pain\nthat I feel that makes me cry, or the visual experience of the boulder\nrolling towards me that makes me run away? At least one can say that\nepiphenomenalism is a fall-back position: it tends to be adopted\nbecause other options are held to be unacceptable.\n\n\nThe second problem is that, if mental states do nothing, there is no\nreason why they should have evolved. This objection ties in with the\nfirst: the intuition there was that conscious states clearly modify our\nbehaviour in certain ways, such as avoiding danger, and it is plain\nthat they are very useful from an evolutionary perspective.\n\n\nFrank Jackson (1982) replies to this objection by saying that it is\nthe brain state associated with pain that evolves for this reason: the\nsensation is a by-product. Evolution is full of useless or even harmful\nby-products. For example, polar bears have evolved thick coats to keep\nthem warm, even though this has the damaging side effect that they are\nheavy to carry. Jackson\u2019s point is true in general, but does not seem\nto apply very happily to the case of mind. The heaviness of the polar\nbear\u2019s coat follows directly from those properties and laws which make\nit warm: one could not, in any simple way, have one without the other.\nBut with mental states, dualistically conceived, the situation is quite\nthe opposite. The laws of physical nature which, the mechanist says,\nmake brain states cause behaviour, in no way explain why brain states\nshould give rise to conscious ones. The laws linking mind and brain are\nwhat Feigl (1958) calls nomological danglers, that is, brute\nfacts added onto the body of integrated physical law. Why there should\nhave been by-products of that kind seems to have no\nevolutionary explanation.\n\n\nThe third problem concerns the rationality of belief in\nepiphenomenalism, via its effect on the problem of other\nminds. It is natural to say that I know that I have mental states\nbecause I experience them directly. But how can I justify my belief\nthat others have them? The simple version of the \u2018argument from\nanalogy\u2019 says that I can extrapolate from my own case. I know\nthat certain of my mental states are correlated with certain pieces of\nbehaviour, and so I infer that similar behaviour in others is also\naccompanied by similar mental states. Many hold that this is a weak\nargument because it is induction from one instance, namely, my own. The\nargument is stronger if it is not a simple induction but an\n\u2018argument to the best explanation\u2019. I seem to know from my\nown case that mental events can be the explanation of behaviour, and I\nknow of no other candidate explanation for typical human behaviour, so\nI postulate the same explanation for the behaviour of others. But if\nepiphenomenalism is true, my mental states do not explain my behaviour\nand there is a physical explanation for the behaviour of others. It is\nexplanatorily redundant to postulate such states for others. I know, by\nintrospection, that I have them, but is it not just as likely that I\nalone am subject to this quirk of nature, rather than that everyone\nis?\n\nFor more detailed treatment and further reading on this topic, see the\nentry\n epiphenomenalism.\n \n\n",
