Critiques of Nishida\u2019s Philosophy\n Criticisms of Nishida\u2019s thought were a significant part of its\ndevelopment during his lifetime, and continue to this day to inform\ndebates about its meaning and relevance. Insofar as Nishida aimed at a\ncomprehensive \u201csystem of self-awareness\u201d (Nishida 1987b,\n70)\u2013\u2013ultimately the system of absolute nothingness\ndetermining itself as the historical world\u2013\u2013his philosophy\nseems to preclude the possibility of radical internal critique. Nishida\ndid not envision his system as closed to development or to an open\nfuture. But several key notions that he never abandoned leave scant\nroom for acknowledging gaps: the notions of a\nuniversal that reflects itself clearly if not completely in its\nparticulars, of a world that mirrors itself in its individuals, of\nmore inclusive topoi that fully envelop less inclusive topoi, or of an\nabsolute that is immanent in all relative selves. How does such a\nsystem account for fallibility, unpredictability, distortion or\nviolence? And where does the author Nishida stand in relation to the\nsystem that he describes. Is the author too merely a reflection of the\nsystem?\n\nIn contrast to interpreting Nishida\u2019s thought as presenting a system\nthat would preempt problems, one can also read it as a series of\nattempts to clarify for himself the activity of living a philosophical\nlife. From this perspective, critique appears as a constant feature of\nNishida\u2019s personal development. During his lifetime Nishida took his\ncritics seriously and sometimes changed course because of their\ncriticisms. Takahashi Satomi, while still a graduate student at the\nUniversity of Tokyo, criticized Nishida\u2019s notion of pure experience\nand spurred him to clarify it in an article published soon after\nAn Inquiry Into the Good. His colleague at Kyoto University,\nS\u014dda Kiichiro, criticized the lack of clarity in his initial\nformulation of basho (place) in 1926 and prompted him to\nremove Neo-Kantian comparisons. More significantly, in the early 1930s\nhis younger colleague Tanabe Hajime and his former student and Marxist\nphilosopher Tosaka Jun criticized Nishida\u2019s focus on consciousness and lack\nof attention to history and social being; Nishida subsequently\ndeveloped his notions of the historical world and the historical\nbody. In the last years of his life, he seemed to anticipate his death\nand recognize human finitude more strongly as an inevitable disruption\nof any comprehensive systematic account. Two years before his death in\n1945, he wrote, \u201cOur life and our existence are not our\nown. They are the determinations of absolute nothingness\u2026. Philosophy\nbegins with the self set on living truly. It is a way for the self to\nbecome self-aware and to live\u201d (NKZ 10, 401,\n 472).[5] \n Nishida\u2019s philosophy continues to live in the profusion of critical\nengagements indicated in the list of secondary literature below. \n",
