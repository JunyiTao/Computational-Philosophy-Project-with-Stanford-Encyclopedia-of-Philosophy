    "main_text": "Characterizing Moral Anti-realism\n1. Characterizing Moral Anti-realism\n\nTraditionally, to hold a realist position with respect to X\nis to hold that X exists objectively. On this view, moral\nanti-realism is the denial of the thesis that moral\nproperties\u2014or facts, objects, relations, events, etc. (whatever\ncategories one is willing to countenance)\u2014exist objectively.\nThis could involve either (1) the denial that moral properties exist\nat all, or (2) the acceptance that they do exist but this existence is\n(in the relevant sense) non-objective. There are broadly two ways of\nendorsing (1): moral noncognitivism and moral error theory. Proponents\nof (2) may be variously thought of as moral non-objectivists, or\nidealists, or constructivists. So understood, moral anti-realism is\nthe disjunction of three theses:\n\nmoral noncognitivism\nmoral error theory\nmoral non-objectivism\n\n\nUsing such labels is not a precise science, nor an uncontroversial\nmatter; here they are employed just to situate ourselves roughly. In\nthis spirit of preliminary imprecision, these views can be initially\ncharacterized as follows:\n\nMoral noncognitivism holds that our moral judgments\nare not in the business of aiming at truth. So, for example, A.J. Ayer\ndeclared that when we say \u201cStealing money is wrong\u201d we do\nnot express a proposition that can be true or false, but rather it is\nas if we say \u201cStealing money!!\u201d with the tone of\nvoice indicating that a special feeling of disapproval is being\nexpressed (Ayer [1936] 1971: 110). Note how the predicate\n\u201c\u2026 is wrong\u201d has disappeared in Ayer\u2019s\ntranslation schema; thus the issues of whether the property of\nwrongness exists, and whether that existence is objective, also\ndisappear.\n\nThe moral error theorist thinks that although our\nmoral judgments aim at the truth, they systematically fail to secure\nit: the world simply doesn\u2019t contain the relevant\n\u201cstuff\u201d to render our moral judgments true. For a more\nfamiliar analogy, compare what an atheist usually claims about\nreligious judgments. On the face of it, religious discourse is\ncognitivist in nature: it would seem that when someone says \u201cGod\nexists\u201d or \u201cGod loves you\u201d they are usually\nasserting something that purports to be true. However, according to\nthe atheist, the world isn\u2019t furnished with the right kind of\nstuff (gods, afterlife, miracles, etc.) necessary to render these\nassertions true. The moral error theorist claims that when we say\n\u201cStealing is morally wrong\u201d we are asserting that the act\nof stealing instantiates the property of moral wrongness, but in fact\nthere is no such property, or at least nothing in the world\ninstantiates it, and thus the utterance is untrue.\n\nNon-objectivism (as it will be called here) allows\nthat moral facts exist but holds that they are non-objective. The\nslogan version comes from Hamlet: \u201cthere is nothing either good\nor bad, but thinking makes it so.\u201d For a quick example of a\nnon-objective fact, consider the different properties that a\nparticular diamond might have. It is true that the diamond is made of\ncarbon, and also true that the diamond is worth $1000, say. But the\nstatus of these facts seems different. That the diamond is carbon\nseems an objective fact: it doesn\u2019t depend on what we think of\nthe matter. (We could all be under the impression that it is not\ncarbon, and all be wrong.) That the diamond is worth $1000, by\ncontrast, seems to depend on us. If we all thought that it was worth\nmore (or less), then it would be worth more (or less).\n\n[This entry uses the label \u201cnon-objectivism\u201d instead of\nthe simple \u201csubjectivism\u201d since there is an entrenched\nusage in metaethics for using the latter to denote the thesis that in\nmaking a moral judgment one is reporting (as opposed to expressing)\none\u2019s own mental attitudes (e.g., \u201cStealing is morally\nwrong\u201d means \u201cI disapprove of stealing\u201d). So\nunderstood, subjectivism is a kind of non-objectivist theory, but\nthere are many other kinds of non-objectivist theory, too.]\n\nIt is tempting to construe this idea of non-objectivity as\n\u201cmind-dependence,\u201d though this, as we will see below, is a\ntricky notion, since something may be mind-independent in one sense\nand mind-dependent in another. Cars, for example, are designed and\nconstructed by creatures with minds, and yet in another sense cars are\nclearly concrete entities whose ongoing existence does not depend on\nour mental activity. Those who feel pessimistic that the notion of\nmind-dependence can be straightened out might prefer to characterize\nmoral realism in a way that makes no reference to objectivity. There\nis also the concern that the objectivity clause threatens to render\nmoral anti-realism trivially true, since there is little room for\ndoubting that the moral status of actions usually (if not always)\ndepends in some manner on mental phenomena, such as the\nintentions with which the action was performed or the episodes of\npleasure and pain that ensue from it. (See Sayre-McCord 1986; also his\nthe entry on\n moral realism.)\n Whether such pessimism is warranted is not something to be decided\nhastily. Perhaps the judicious course is to make a terminological\ndistinction between minimal moral realism\u2014which is the\ndenial of noncognitivism and error theory\u2014and robust moral\nrealism\u2014which in addition asserts the objectivity of moral\nfacts. (See Rosen 1994 for this distinction.) In what follows,\nhowever, \u201cmoral realism\u201d will continue to be used to\ndenote the traditional robust version.\n\nIf moral anti-realism is understood in this manner, then there are\nseveral things with which it is important not to confuse it.\n\nFirst, moral anti-realism is not a form of moral\nskepticism. If we take moral skepticism to be the claim that\nthere is no such thing as moral knowledge, and we take knowledge to be\njustified true belief, then there are three ways of being a moral\nskeptic: one can deny that moral judgments are beliefs, one can deny\nthat moral judgments are ever true, or one can deny that moral\njudgments are ever justified. The noncognitivist makes the first of\nthese denials, and the error theorist makes the second, thus\nnoncognitivists and error theorists count as both moral anti-realists\nand moral skeptics. However, since the non-objectivity of some fact\ndoes not pose a particular problem regarding the possibility of\none\u2019s knowing it (I might know that a certain diamond is worth\n$1000, for example), then there is nothing to stop the moral\nnon-objectivist from accepting the existence of moral knowledge. So\nmoral non-objectivism is a form of moral anti-realism that need not be\na form of moral skepticism. Conversely, one might maintain that moral\njudgments are sometimes objectively true\u2014thus being a moral\nrealist\u2014while also maintaining that moral judgments always lack\njustification\u2014thus being a moral skeptic. (See entry for\n moral skepticism.)\n\nSpeaking more generally, moral anti-realism, as it has been defined\nhere, contains no epistemological clause: it is silent on the question\nof whether we are justified in making moral judgments. This is worth\nnoting since moral realists often want to support a view of morality\nthat would guarantee our justified access to a realm of objective\nmoral facts. But any such epistemic guarantee will need to be argued\nfor separately; it is not implied by realism itself. Indeed, if\nobjective facts are those that do not depend on our mental activity,\nthen they are precisely those facts that we can all be mistaken about,\nand thus it seems reasonable to suppose that the desire for moral\nfacts to be objective and the desire for a guarantee of epistemic\naccess to moral facts are desiderata that are in tension with each\nother.\n\nSecond, it is worth stating explicitly that moral anti-realism is not\na form of moral relativism\u2014or, perhaps more\nusefully noted: that moral relativism is not a form of moral\nanti-realism. Moral relativism is a form of cognitivism according to\nwhich moral claims contain an indexical element, such that the truth\nof any such claim requires relativization to some individual or group.\nAccording to a simple form of relativism, the claim \u201cStealing is\nmorally wrong\u201d might be true when one person utters it, and\nfalse when someone else utters it. The important thing to note is that\nthis would not necessarily make moral wrongness non-objective. For\nexample, suppose someone were to make the relativistic claim that\ndifferent moral values, virtues, and duties apply to different groups\nof people due to, say, their social caste. If this person were asked\nin virtue of what these relativistic moral facts obtain, there is\nnothing to prevent them offering the full-blooded realist answer:\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the way the universe objectively is.\u201d\nRelativism does not stand opposite objectivism; it stands opposite\nabsolutism (the form of cognitivism according to which the truth of\nmoral claims does not require relativization to any individual or\ngroup). One can be both a moral relativist and a moral objectivist\n(and thus a moral realist); conversely, one can be both a moral\nnon-objectivist (and thus a moral anti-realist) and a moral\nabsolutist. (See entries for\n relativism\n and\n moral relativism.)\n\nOf course, someone could simply stipulate that moral realism includes\nthe denial of moral relativism, and perhaps the philosophical\ncommunity could be persuaded to adopt this definition (in which case\nthis entry would need to be revised). But it seems reasonable to\nsuspect that the common tendency to think that moral realism and moral\nrelativism are opposed to each other is, more often than not, due a\nconfused conflation of the objectivism/non-objectivism distinction and\nthe absolutism/relativism distinction.\n\nThird and finally, it might be helpful to clarify the relationship\nbetween moral anti-realism and moral naturalism. The\nmoral naturalist believes that moral facts exist and fit within the\nworldview presented by science. (For example, a utilitarian view that\nidentifies moral obligation with the production of happiness will\ncount as a form of moral naturalism, since there is nothing\nparticularly scientifically mysterious about happiness.) A moral\nnaturalist may maintain that moral facts are objective in nature, in\nwhich case this moral naturalist will count as a moral realist. But a\nmoral naturalist may instead maintain that the moral facts are not\nobjective in nature, in which case this moral naturalist will count as\na moral anti-realist. Consider, for example, a simplistic\nnon-objectivist theory that identifies moral goodness (say) with\nwhatever a person approves of. Such a view would be a form of\nanti-realism (in virtue of its non-objectivism), but since the\nphenomenon of people approving of things is something that can be\naccommodated smoothly within a scientific framework, it would also be\na form of moral naturalism. Conversely, if a moral realist maintains\nthat the objective moral facts cannot be accommodated within the\nscientific worldview, then this moral realist will count as a moral\nnon-naturalist. (See entries for\n naturalism\n and\n moral naturalism.)\n\nThe noncognitivist and the error theorist, it should be noted, count\nas neither moral naturalists nor moral non-naturalists, since they do\nnot believe in moral facts at all. These kinds of moral anti-realist,\nhowever, may well be naturalists in a more general sense: they may\nmaintain that the only items that we should admit into our ontology\nare those that fit within the scientific worldview. Indeed, it is\nquite likely that it is their commitment to this more general\nontological naturalism that lies behind the noncognitivist\u2019s and\nthe error theorist\u2019s moral skepticism, since they may deem that\nmoral properties (were they to exist) would have to have\ncharacteristics that cannot be accommodated within a naturalistic\nframework.\n\nSumming up: Some moral anti-realists will count as moral skeptics, but\nsome may believe in moral knowledge. Some moral anti-realists will be\nrelativists, but some may be moral absolutists (and many are neither).\nSome moral anti-realists will be moral naturalists, but some may be\nmoral non-naturalists, and some will be neither moral naturalists nor\nnon-naturalists. These various positions can be combined into a\npotentially bewildering array of possible complex metaethical\npositions (e.g., non-skeptical, relativistic, non-naturalistic moral\nanti-realism)\u2014though, needless to say, these views may vary\ngreatly in plausibility.\n",
