    "main_text": "The Limits of Inquiry and the Complexity of Empirical Problems || Verifiable and Refutable Hypotheses\n3.1 Verifiable and Refutable Hypotheses\n\nThe next set of concepts we need to understand the structure of\nhypotheses that can be settled by reliable inquiry are the notions of\n verifiable and  falsifiable  hypotheses. The\nverifiability and falsifiability of claims have been extensively\ndiscussed in epistemology and the philosophy of science, especially by\nphilosophers concerned with issues in logical empiricism. This\nsubsection describes how these concepts are used in learning theory,\nthen compares the learning-theoretic concepts with discussions in\nbroader epistemology.\n\nA hypothesis \\(H\\) is  verifiable  if whenever \\(H\\)\nis correct, eventually evidence is observed that entails that \\(H\\)\nis correct. More formally: \\(H\\) is verifiable with respect to a\nhypothesis set \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) if for every complete data sequence for which\n\\(H\\) is correct, there is a finite number of observations that\nfalsify all alternative hypotheses \\(H'\\) from \\(\\mathbf{H}\\).\nA hypothesis \\(H\\) is  refutable  if whenever \\(H\\),\neventually evidence is observed that falsifies \\(H\\). More\nformally: \\(H\\) is refutable with respect to a hypothesis set\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\) if for every complete data sequence for which \\(H\\) is\nnot correct (but some other hypothesis in \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is), there\nis a finite number of observations that falsifies \\(H\\).\n\nExamples\n\nThe hypothesis \\(H_2 =\\) \u201csome (observed) raven is not\nblack\u201d is verifiable but not refutable. It is verifiable because\nany data sequence for which it is correct, features a non-black raven\nat some finite time. The observation of the non-black raven entails\n\\(H_2\\). The hypothesis \\(H_2\\) is not\nfalsifiable, because if only black ravens are observed forever,\nthen \\(H_2\\) is incorrect, but there is no finite number of\nobservations that falsifies \\(H_2\\).\nThe hypothesis \\(H_1 =\\) \u201call (observed) ravens are\nblack\u201d is refutable but not verifiable. It is refutable because\nany data sequence for which it is not correct, features a non-black\nraven at some finite time. The observation of the non-black raven\nfalsifies \\(H_1\\). \\(H_1\\) is not verifiable,\nbecause if only black ravens are observed forever, then \\(H_1\\)\nis correct, but there is no finite number of observations that entails\n\\(H_1\\).\nIn the New Riddle of Induction of\n Section 1.2\n (diagram repeated below for convenience), the hypothesis \u201call\n(observed) emeralds are green\u201d is falsifiable but not\nverifiable, for the same reason as \u201call (observed) ravens are\nblack\u201d is refutable but not verifiable.\nAny of the grue hypotheses \\(H_t =\\) \u201call (observed)\nemeralds are grue(t) \u201d is verifiable  and  refutable.\n\\(H_t\\) is refutable because any complete data sequence for\nwhich a gruesome generalization is incorrect will feature a\ncounterexample that falsifies it. \\(H_t\\) is verifiable because\nif it is correct, the first observation of a blue emerald at time\n\\(t\\) falsifies the hypothesis \u201call (observed) emeralds are\ngreen \u201d and also falsifies all other \\(H_t\\)\nhypotheses.\n\n\nThe example of the gruesome hypotheses shows that an empirical\nhypothesis can be both verifiable and refutable (sometimes called\n\u201cdecidable\u201d in analogy with\n computation theory).\n Other typical examples of decidable empirical claims are singular\nobservations, such as \u201cthe first raven is black\u201d, and Boolean\ncombinations of singular observations.\n\n\nFigure 4 [An extended description of figure 4 is in a supplement.]\n\n\nWe will briefly discuss similarities and differences to related\nconcepts from epistemology and the philosophy of science.\n\nVerificationism  is part of the philosophy of\n logical empiricism.\n The core idea is that for a claim to be meaningful, it must be\nempirically verifiable. The main difference with our concept is the\nphilosophical objective: the goal of learning theory is not to\nseparate meaningful from meaningless claims, but to characterize the\nstandards of empirical success we can expect from inquiry for a given\nset of hypotheses. A hypothesis that is verifiable according to the\ndefinition above allows inquiry to provide a  positive test :\nwhen the hypothesis is correct, inquiry will eventually indicate its\ncorrectness with certainty (given background knowledge). The specific\ndefinitions of \u201cverifiability\u201d offered by the logical\nempiricists are not equivalent to verifiability in the\nlearning-theoretic sense. For example,\n strict verificationism\n holds that \u201cin order to be meaningful a claim must be implied\nby a finite number of observation sentences.\u201d. No finite number\nof observation sentences is equivalent to the hypothesis that\n\\(H_2 =\\) \u201csome (observed) raven is not black\u201d,\nbecause this hypothesis is equivalent to an infinite disjunction of\nobservation sentences (i.e., a non-black raven at time 1, a non-black\nraven at time 2, \u2026).\n\nFalsificationism\n is a well-known view in the philosophy of science. The core idea is\nthat for a hypothesis to be scientific, rather than pseudo-scientific\nor metaphysical, it must be falsifiable in the following sense:\n\u201cstatements \u2026, in order to be ranked as scientific, must be\ncapable of conflicting with possible, or conceivable\nobservations\u201d. (Popper 1962, 39). The main difference with our\ndevelopment is the philosophical objective: the goal of learning\ntheory is not to demarcate scientific hypotheses from\npseudo-scientific theories, but to characterize the standards of\nempirical success we can expect from inquiry for a given set of\nhypotheses. A hypothesis that is refutable according to the definition\nabove allows inquiry to provide a  negative test: when the\nhypothesis is incorrect, inquiry will eventually indicate its\nincorrectness with certainty (given background knowledge). The\nspecific definition of \u201cfalsifiability\u201d in the Popper\nquote above is not equivalent to refutability in the\nlearning-theoretic sense [Schulte and Juhl 1996]. For example, the\nhypothesis \\(H =\\) \u201cthe first raven is black and some other\nraven is non-black\u201d conflicts with the possible observation that\nthe first raven is white. However, if in fact all observed ravens are\nblack, then \\(H\\) is incorrect but not falsified by any finite\nnumber of observations, hence not refutable according to the\nlearning-theoretic definition. For further discussion of the\nrelationship between Popperian falsification and learning theory see\n[Genin 2018].\n",
