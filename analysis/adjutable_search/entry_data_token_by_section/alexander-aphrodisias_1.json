    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works and their history\n1.2 Works and their history\n\nAs the list of his work shows, Alexander was a prolific writer. His\nwritings comprise both commentaries (hupomn\u00eamata) on\nthe works of Aristotle and several systematic treatises of his own\n(including works on \u2018problems\u2019, consisting of series of\nessays on different Aristotelian texts and topics). Of the\ncommentaries, the following are extant:  On Prior Analytics\nI, Topics, Metaphysics, Meteorologica, and On\nSense Perception. Of the commentary on the Metaphysics\nonly the first five books are by general consent accepted as genuine;\nthe remaining nine books are attributed to the late commentator\nMichael of Ephesus (11th-12th century CE.). The commentary on the\nSophistical Refutations, ascribed to Alexander in some\nmanuscripts, is considered spurious. References by later commentators\nshow that Alexander\u2019s commentaries covered all of Aristotle\u2019s\ntheoretical philosophy, including his physical writings (with the\nexception of the biological works). The list of his lost work is long:\nthere are references to commentaries on the Categories,\nDe interpretatione, Posterior Analytics,\nPhysics, and On the Heavens, as well as On the\nSoul and On Memory. Alexander did not write commentaries\non Aristotle\u2019s Ethics or Politics, nor on the\nPoetics or the Rhetoric. That he had quite some\ninterest in ethical problems, however, is witnessed by the discussions\nin his own treatises. Among the extant short systematic writings the\nfollowing are regarded as genuine: Problems and Solutions, Ethical\nProblems, On Fate, On Mixture and Increase, On the\nSoul and a Supplement to On the Soul\n(\u2018Mantissa\u2019 lit. \u2018make-weight\u2019) that not only\ncontain discussions of questions concerning psychology but also\nproblems in physics, ethics, vision and light, as well as fate and\nprovidence. The \u2018Mantissa\u2019 may not be by Alexander but a\ncompilation of notes by his students. The rest, Medical Questions,\nPhysical Problems, and On Fevers are considered\nspurious. Of his lost works some have been preserved in Arabic because\nthey were highly influential (see D\u2019Ancona & Serra 2002): On\nthe Principles of the Universe, On Providence,\nAgainst Galen on Motion, and On Specific\nDifferences. Because of Alexander\u2019s prestige and authority as an\ninterpreter of Aristotle, many of his works now lost were incorporated\nin the commentaries of his successors, whether they name him or not.\nNothing certain is known about the relative chronology of his\nwritings, but this is not an issue of much importance, since his\ncommentaries may well represent the results of many years of teaching,\nwith later insertions and additions, in a way quite similar to\nAristotle\u2019s own texts. This would explain the lack of any attempt at\nelegance and the occurrence of inconsistencies or unclear transitions\nin Alexander.\n",
