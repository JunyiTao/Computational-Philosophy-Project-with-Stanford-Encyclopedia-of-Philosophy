Immutable Laws and Contingent Trends\n\nAn additional mistake which Popper discerns in historicism is the\nfailure of the historicist to distinguish between scientific\nlaws and trends. This makes him think it possible to\nexplain change by discovering trends running through past history, and\nto anticipate and predict future occurrences on the basis of such\nobservations. Here Popper points out that there is a critical\ndifference between a trend and a scientific law: the latter is\nuniversal in form, while a trend can be expressed only as a singular\nexistential statement. This logical difference is crucial: neither\nconditional nor unconditional predictions can be based upon trends,\nbecause trends may change or be reversed with a change in the\nconditions which gave rise to them in the first instance. As Popper\nputs it, there can be no doubt that\n\n\nthe habit of confusing trends with laws, together with the intuitive\nobservation of trends such as technical progress, inspired the central\ndoctrines of \u2026 historicism. (1957: 106)\n\n\nHe does not, of course, dispute the existence of trends or deny that\nobserving them can be of practical utility value. But the essential\npoint is that a trend is something which itself ultimately\nstands in need of scientific explanation, and it cannot therefore\nfunction as the frame of reference in terms of which an unconditional\nprediction can be based.\n\nA point which connects with this has to do with the role which the\nevolution of human knowledge has played in the historical development\nof human society. Human history has, Popper points out, been strongly\ninfluenced by the growth of human knowledge, and it is\nextremely likely that this will continue to be the case\u2014all the\nempirical evidence suggests that the link between the two is\nprogressively consolidating. However, this gives rise to a further\nproblem for the historicist: no scientific predictor, human or\notherwise, can possibly predict its own future results. From this it\nfollows, he holds, that no society can predict, scientifically, its\nown future states of knowledge. Thus, while the future evolution of\nhuman history is extremely likely to be influenced by new developments\nin human knowledge, we cannot now scientifically determine what such\nknowledge will be.\n\nFrom this it follows that if the future holds any new discoveries or\nany new developments in the growth of our knowledge, then it is\nimpossible for us to predict them now, and it is therefore impossible\nfor us to predict the future development of human history now, given\nthat the latter will, at least in part, be determined by the future\ngrowth of our knowledge. Thus, once again historicism\ncollapses\u2014the dream of a theoretical, predictive science of\nhistory is unrealisable, because it is an impossible dream.\n\nPopper\u2019s argues against the propriety of large-scale planning of\nsocial structures on the basis of this demonstration of the logical\nshortcomings of historicism. It is, he argues, theoretically as well\nas practically misguided, because, again, part of what we are planning\nfor is our future knowledge, and our future knowledge is not something\nwhich we can in principle now possess\u2014we cannot adequately plan\nfor unexpected advances in our future knowledge, or for the effects\nwhich such advances will have upon society as a whole. For him, this\nnecessitates the acceptance of historical indeterminism as the only\nphilosophy of history which is commensurate with a proper\nunderstanding of the provisional and incomplete nature of human\nknowledge.\n\nThis critique of historicism and holism is balanced, on the positive\nside, by Popper\u2019s affirmation of the ideals of individualism and\nmarket economics and his strong defence of the open society\u2014the\nview that a society is equivalent to the sum of its members, that the\nactions of the members of society serve to fashion and to shape it,\nand that the social consequences of intentional actions are very\noften, and very largely, unintentional. This part of his social\nphilosophy was influenced by the economist Friedrich Hayek, who worked\nwith him at the London School of Economics and who was a life-long\nfriend. Popper advocates what he (rather unfortunately) terms\n\u201cpiecemeal social engineering\u201d as the central mechanism\nfor social planning: in utilising this mechanism, intentional actions\nare directed to the achievement of one specific goal at a time, which\nmakes it possible to determine whether adverse unintended effects of\nintentional actions occur, in order to correct and readjust when this\nproves necessary. This, of course, parallels precisely the critical\ntesting of theories in scientific investigation. This approach to\nsocial planning (which is explicitly based upon the premise that we do\nnot, because we cannot, know what the future will be like) encourages\nattempts to put right what is problematic in\nsociety\u2014generally-acknowledged social ills\u2014rather than\nattempts to impose some preconceived idea of the \u201cgood\u201d\nupon society as a whole. For Popper, in a genuinely open society\npiecemeal social engineering goes hand-in-hand with negative\nutilitarianism, the attempt to minimise the amount of suffering and\nmisery, rather than, as with positive utilitarianism, the attempt to\nmaximise the amount of happiness. The state, he holds, should concern\nitself with the task of progressively formulating and implementing\npolicies designed to deal with the social problems which actually\nconfront it, with the goal of mitigating human misery and suffering to\nthe greatest possible degree. The positive task of increasing social\nand personal happiness, by contrast, can and should be left to\nindividual citizens, who may, of course, act collectively to that end.\n\u201cMy thesis\u201d, Popper states, is that\n\n\nhuman misery is the most urgent problem of a rational public policy\nand that happiness is not such a problem. The attainment of happiness\nshould be left to our private endeavours. (1963: 361)\n\n\nThus, for Popper, in the final analysis the activity of\nproblem-solving is as definitive of our humanity at the level of\nsocial and political organisation as it is at the level of science,\nand it is this key insight which unifies and integrates the broad\nspectrum of his thought.\n",
