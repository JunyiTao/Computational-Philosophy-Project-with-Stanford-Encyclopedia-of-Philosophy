    "main_text": "Thinking\n11. Thinking\n\nRyle\u2019s express target in The Concept of Mind was the\nCartesianism of the Official Doctrine, and the ontological,\nepistemological and semantic predicament we would be confronted with\nif the view were correct. Because of this target, many of his\nreminders about how mental expressions are used point to the kinds of\ncircumstances and performances that would satisfy them: often these\ninclude what others suitably trained have no trouble seeing. But he\nwas dissatisfied that in this work he left out some of the cardinal\nuses of concepts of thinking, in which there may be no performances\nfor others to witness. Certainly, the concept of thinking applies to\nobservable performances. But it also applies to the many\nthinking-activities we may imagine of Rodin\u2019s Le\nPenseur who is merely sitting on a rock with his chin in his\nhand. Ryle\u2019s professed long-range objective in much of his later\nwork was to come to an understanding of the various sorts of thinking\nqua pensive without committing either the\n\u201cCategory-howler of Behaviourism or the Category-howler of\nCartesianism\u201d (1979a, 17). In these later articles, he suggests\nthat what is needed besides the choice between \u201cnot muscular,\ntherefore inner\u201d or \u201cnot inner, therefore muscular\u201d\nis a way of enlarging the domain of the mental so that it includes not\nonly actions or performances but also certain omissions or failures to\nact that are conceived on a relatively high step of the ladder of\nsophistication of mental discourse (1979c, 119).\n\nLike all or at least most philosophically interesting concepts, Ryle\nthought there was no general answer to the question \u2018What does\nthinking consist of?\u2019 (any more that there is a general answer\nto the question \u2018What does working consist of?\u2019).\n\nWhen we start to theorise about thinking, we naturally hanker to\nfollow the chemist\u2019s example, namely, to say what thinking\nconsists of and how the ingredients of which it consists are\ncombined \u2026. But modelling thinking on processes like perspiring,\ndigesting, counting, and apple-picking, which can be broken down into\ningredient processes which have been coordinated in a certain way is a\nmistake \u2026. (1951b, 260)\n\n\nThere is a host of widely different sorts of toiling and idlings,\nengaging in any one of which is thinking.\n\nRyle rejects the view that thinking is symbol manipulation: indeed, he\ndenies that words, phrases or sentences are symbols, if symbols are to\nbe understood as proxies or as representations for something else\n(perhaps that which the word is alleged to designate). Thinking, in\nthe sense of pondering, calculating, and musing, is not reserved for\nthe labour of trying to decide things. Nor do we reserve the title\n\u2018thinking\u2019 for inner processes. An architect can think out\nhis plan while manipulating toy bricks as can a sculptor plan a statue\nin marble by modelling a piece of plasticine. Additional labours might\nbe necessary to put these plans into words. In general, thinking\nshould not be equated with using language.\n\nOur ordinary ways of describing our ponderings and musings tend to be\ngraphic and not literal. They should be histories, not chronicles, and\nas such the plot should be told in abstraction from any particular\nstream-of-consciousness reports of detail we may recall. In only some\ncases of thinking the accomplishment of a task, if there is one,\ninvolves the thinker\u2019s being equipped to declare his policy,\nscheme or theory. But there can be thinking where there is no talking\nor even the attempt to talk. Mozart\u2019s thinking results in\nsomething playable, not statable; Cezanne may make mistakes but is not\nin error. A symphony is not composed in English or German, it has no\ntranslation, and there is no evidence for or against it. Thus,\nalthough it is an important truth that the products of thinking may be\npublishable truths or falsehoods (and not unshareable\nintrospectibles), this is true for only some types of thinking (1979b,\n85).\n\nWhen the thinking does result in propositions or sayings, however, the\ntemptation is on the one hand toward excessive inflation, and on the\nother toward excessive deflation. For the result is not merely a\nstring of words linked together in a grammatically well-formed\nsentence. In recognising this truth, however, we are tempted toward\nthe view that bits of language are only necessary as the interpersonal\nvehicles of objective Meanings that are thinkable, in principle, to\nany hearers or readers of any nationalities.\n\nThese Meanings are for the Duplicationist those significance-cargoes\nthat are carried indifferently by your French and my English internal\nlocutions\u2014though the challenge to exhibit to his Reductionist\ncritic even one such cargo, prised off its French or English vehicle,\nis as usual unwelcome to him. (1979b, 87)\n\n\nRyle\u2019s solution is to reject the vehicle-cargo model. In owning\na penny, the duplicationist is right in saying I own more than a mere\nmetallic disc; but the reductionist is also right in rejecting the\nidea that I own two things: a mere disc and a non-metallic,\nunpocketable yet marketable cargo. The word I employ is not a noise\nand something else as well; nor is just a noise. In learning a\nword\u2019s meaning, I become enabled to conduct with it a host of\ninter alia informative, calculative, recording,\nanagram-solving, and versifying transactions of quite specific kinds.\nJust as a penny is not just a disc and nor is it a disc and something\nelse as well, so a word is not just noise, but nor is it a noise and\nsomething else as well. The penny is an institutionally-qualified\nenabling instrument that I can use for specific sorts of transactions.\nThe word is a complexly qualified noise, endowed with a quite specific\nsaying-power, endowed by institutional regulations, accumulating\npublic custom, pedagogic disciplines, and so on. The formulation of\nthe qualifications of both penny and word would \u201crequire not\njust some simple auxiliary nouns, simple adjectives or simple verbs\nbut a whole batch of syntactically variegated subordinate\nclauses\u201d (1979b, 88).\n\nEven if it is true that Le Penseur is saying things to\nhimself, this description fails because it stops just where it ought\nto begin. \u2018Murmuring syllables\u2019 to himself is the thinnest\npossible description of what he is engaged in. A thick description may\nbe that he is trying to find out whether or not the things that he is\nsaying will lead him where he wants to go:\n\n\u2026 in his pondering, reflecting, deliberating, etc., the thinker\nis not guiding himself anywhere, but trying to find out whether this\nor that track of his own making would or would not qualify as a\nguiding, as opposed to a mis-guiding, or non-guiding, track. (1968,\n494)\n\n\nExploring is on a higher-sophistication level than piloting; and\npiloting is on a higher sophistication level than following a\npilot\u2019s lead. If Le Penseur is trying to find the proof\nof a new theorem then he is working on a higher accomplishment-level\nthan he is in trying to teach his student his proof when he has got\nit; just as trying to teach it is on a higher-sophistication level\nthan that on which his students are working in trying to master\nit.\n\nOn its thinnest description, Le Penseur may be muttering to\nhimself a few geometrical words or phrases, just as on its thinnest\ndescription a penny is a piece of metal. But to say that that is not\nall he is doing (or that that is not all the penny\nis) is consistent with saying it is the only thing he is doing or with\ndenying that the penny is a piece of metal and something else as\nwell.\n\nA statesman signing his surname to a peace-treaty is doing much more\nthan inscribe the seven letters of his surname, but he is not doing\nmany or any more things. He is bringing war to a close by inscribing\nthe seven letters of his surname. (1968, 496)\n\n\nThinking can be saying things to oneself under a thin description.\nUnder a thicker description it may be saying things to oneself with\nthe specific heuristic intention of trying to open one\u2019s eyes or\nconsolidate one\u2019s grasp. It is this specific, experimental\nintention that is obliterated, Ryle tells us, by sweeping generic\nslogans such as \u201cThought is Language\u201d or \u201cThinking\nis Saying Things to Oneself\u201d, whether or not this is\nsupplemented by \u201c\u2026 and Something Else as Well.\u201d The\nadverb \u2018experimentally\u2019 adds not an extra action but the\nintention-to-find-out-what-happens-when \u2026. Neither the\nReductionist nor the Duplicationist (the Behaviourist or the\nCartesian) can account for the adverb\n\u2018experimentally\u2019.\n\nThey had tried to tell us what pondering is, eluding that little knot\nof subordinate clauses, such as \u2018\u2026 in order\nto \u2026\u2019, \u2018what happens\u2026\u2019, and\n\u2018\u2026 when \u2026\u2019 without which the notion of\nexperimenting cannot be unpacked; no more than burglary,\ntreaty-signing, or goal-scoring can deliberately be described in\nsimple adjectives plus simple verbs, whether mundane or\ntranscendent. What qualifies an undertaking as one of pondering or,\nnot very differently, as one of discussing, is not any catalogue of\nsimple qualities and simple relations, whether rude or refined, but\nsome nexus of statable because statement-shaped conditions.
