    "main_text": "Building Blocks of Modern Theories of Information || Optimal Codes\n3.2 Optimal Codes\n\nThe fact that frequencies of letters vary in a language was known\nsince the invention of book printing. Printers needed many more\n\u201ce\u201ds and \u201ct\u201ds than \u201cx\u201ds or\n\u201cq\u201ds to typeset an English text. This knowledge was used\nextensively to decode ciphers since the seventeenth century (Kahn\n1967; Singh 1999). In 1844 an assistant of Samuel Morse, Alfred Vail,\ndetermined the frequency of letters used in a local newspaper in\nMorristown, New Jersey, and used them to optimize Morse code. Thus the\ncore of theory of optimal codes was already established long before\nShannon developed its mathematical foundation (Shannon 1948; Shannon\n& Weaver 1949). Historically important but philosophically less\nrelevant are the efforts of Charles Babbage to construct computing\nmachines (Difference Engine in 1821, and the Analytical Engine\n1834\u20131871) and the attempt of Ada Lovelace (1815\u20131852) to\ndesign what is considered to be the first programming language for the\nAnalytical Engine.\n",
