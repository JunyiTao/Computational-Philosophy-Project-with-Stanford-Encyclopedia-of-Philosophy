    "main_text": "\n\nFun fact: the word \u2018ambiguous\u2019, at least according to the\nOxford English Dictionary, is ambiguous: it can mean uncertainty or\ndubiousness on the one hand and a sign bearing multiple meanings on\nthe other. I mention this merely to disambiguate what this entry is\nabout, which concerns a word or phrase enjoying multiple meanings. In\nthis sense, ambiguity has been the source of much frustration,\nbemusement, and amusement for philosophers, lexicographers, linguists,\ncognitive scientists, literary theorists and critics, authors, poets,\norators and pretty much every other being who uses language regularly\nto communicate.\n\nPhilosophers\u2019 interest in ambiguity stems from several sources,\nranging from an intense interest in logical representation to\npragmatic, political and ethical concerns about how we use language to\ncommunicate. An example of the first concerns regarding the\nregimentation of natural language in formal logic: arguments that may\nlook good in virtue of their linguistic form in fact can go very wrong\nif the words or phrases involved are equivocal. It would be logical\nfolly, for example, to conclude from the true (on one reading)\nsentences \u2018All bachelors are necessarily unmarried\u2019 and\n\u2018Adam was a bachelor\u2019 that Adam was necessarily unmarried.\nIn other words, philosophers have often found ambiguity the sort of\nthing one needs to avoid and eradicate when they do their serious\nphilosophical business. Frege worried about the phenomenon enough to\ncounsel against allowing any multiplicities of sense in a perfect\nlanguage. An example of the second may be found in the infamous case\nof Smith vs. United States in which the law stipulated that a\nweapon used in the main question was whether the law proscribing\npenalties for using a firearm in committing a crime applied\nto weapons used as items of exchange for drugs.\n\nAuthors, poets, lyricists and the like, on the other hand, have often\nfound ambiguity to be an extremely powerful tool. Thomas\nPynchon\u2019s sentence \u201cwe have forests full of game and\nhundreds of beaters who drive the animals toward the hunters such as\nmyself who are waiting to shoot them,\u201d (Against the Day, p. 46)\nutilizes the referential ambiguity of \u2018them\u2019 to great\neffect when said by his fictionalized Archduke Ferdinand.\nShakespeare\u2019s \u201cAsk for me tomorrow and you shall find me a\ngrave man\u201d (Romeo and Juliet, Act III, Scene 1 line 97\u201398)\nplays cleverly on the double meaning of \u2018grave\u2019. Comedians\nhave often found ambiguity useful in the misdirection essential to\nsome forms of comedy. Groucho Marx\u2019s \u201cI shot an elephant\nin my pajamas\u201d is a classic example.\n\nAmbiguity is important and it is worth examining what the phenomenon\nis and how it differs and relates to similar phenomena such as\nindexicality, polysemy, vagueness, and especially sense generality.\nWhile \u2018is an uncle\u2019 can be satisfied by both brothers of\nmothers and brothers of fathers, the phrase is not ambiguous but\nunspecified with respect to parent.  The boundaries of the predicate\n\u2018is a heap\u2019 is famously difficult to detect but the\nproblem doesn\u2019t seem to be that \u2018heap\u2019 enjoys too\nmany meanings. The article will focus on what the phenomenon is and\nisn\u2019t and discuss some of the interesting factors that\nconfound the easy detection and categorization of apparent\nambiguities.\n",
