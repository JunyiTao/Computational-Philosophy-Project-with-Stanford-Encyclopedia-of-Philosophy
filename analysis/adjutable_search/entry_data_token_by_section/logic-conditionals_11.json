    "main_text": "Premise Semantics || Correspondence with ordering semantics\n4.3 Correspondence with ordering semantics\n\nDavid Lewis (1981) proved that the truth conditions of premise\nsemantics and ordering semantics fundamentally correspond to each\nother. One can start with a premise model and define a strict partial\nordering for an o-model that gives the same results: define \\(u\n\\prec_w v\\) iff the set of all premises in \\(\\Gamma(w)\\) true at world\n\\(u\\) is a proper superset of the set of premises true at world \\(v\\).\nAnd conversely, one can start with an o-model based on a strict\npartial ordering and define a premise model that gives the same\nresults: define \\(\\Gamma(w)\\) as the set of all propositions of the\nform \n\n\\[X_v := \\{u\\in W: u\\prec_w v \\text{ or } u=v\\},\\]\n\n\nfor every \\(v\\in W\\).\n\nLewis in his paper discusses several refinements of the\ncorrespondence, depending on which conditions are imposed on ordering\nframes, and further results can be found in Chemla (2011). From a\nphilosophical and foundational perspective, the correspondence may be\ntaken to suggest that the choice between an ordering-first approach\nand a premise-first approach doesn\u2019t matter. Arguably, however,\na premise semantics may be judged more explanatory than one in which\nthe ordering comes first, for two reasons. First of all, from a\ncognitive perspective, it may be argued that premise semantics is\ncloser to implementing the Ramsey test idea, since an ordering\nsemantics only implicitly refers to the idea of making adjustments to\none\u2019s belief set. Secondly, in an o-semantics the question is\nindeed moot what determines similarity between worlds. Of course,\nwhich facts to admit or not in premise semantics is also problematic,\nbut using propositions as an ordering source makes clearer that\nsimilarity between worlds is a relative rather than an absolute\nmatter. In recent years, several authors have proposed to further\nclarify the problem of premise selection in counterfactuals by looking\nat causal models of reasoning (K. Schulz 2007; Briggs 2012; S.\nKaufmann 2013; Santorio 2019).\n\nBased on the correspondence between ordering semantics and premise\nsemantics, Kratzer (1979) mentions that Burgess\u2019s system\nB is sound and complete for the latter. Veltman\n(1985: 108\u2013132) proved that flat conditionals interpreted by\npremise semantics can be characterized by the axioms of system\nP. Results obtained in the 1990s show that such\nconditionals have an additional special property that cannot, however,\nbe expressed as an axiom of conditional\n logic:[6]\n\n\\((*)\\)\nIf \\((A\\vee B) >C\\) is accepted (or true at \\(w\\)), then there\nare \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) such that \\(D\\wedge E\\) entails \\(C\\), and \\(A\n>D\\) and \\(B >E\\) are both accepted (or true at \\(w\\)).\n\n\nAmong the recent modifications of premise semantics with causal\nmodels, Santorio\u2019s (2019) filtering semantics ends up giving up\nOR.\n",
