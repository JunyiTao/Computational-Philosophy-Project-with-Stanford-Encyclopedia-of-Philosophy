    "main_text": "Philosophy || Ethics\n3.6 Ethics\n\nBoethius\u2019 lost Quaestiones morales was probably a\nquestion commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics.\nThere he must have discussed human free will, because elsewhere he\nsays that topic belongs to ethics. But in particular, he is likely to\nhave concentrated on the nature of the supreme good (= happiness), to\nwhich he (later, presumably) dedicated a small treatise.\n\nDe summo bono (\u201cOn the Supreme Good\u201d) is a\npassionate defense of the thesis that the ideal life is that of an\nintellectual, a philosopher, who spends his life in the pursuit of\ntruth. It is a rhetorical masterpiece, containing one of the longest\nperiods in all of Latin literature that keeps the reader in suspense\nfor about two pages. According to Boethius, the supreme good possible\nfor man consists in \u201cknowing the true, doing the good, and\ntaking delight in both\u201d. By concentrating on the quest for\ntruth, the philosopher comes to act in a morally correct way (a)\nbecause of the insight he has gained in what is base and what is\nnoble, (b) because being absorbed in theoretical work and enjoying it\nhe will not be tempted by sensual pleasures, and (c) because, as\nopposed to other activities, theorizing cannot be overdone. So, the\nphilosopher \u201clives as man was born to live\u201d.\n\nSpecial attention is paid to the philosopher\u2019s quest for\nknowledge about the First Cause, alias God, but what Boethius claims\nwe can know is actually just that it/he is the cause of the\n\u201cproduction\u201d of all beings, of their mutual order in the\nchain of being, and of their conservation (cf.\n \u00a73.1,\n above).\n\nBoethius\u2019 argumentation is primarily based on the Aristotelian\nergon argument: the highest good for a human being is to\ndevelop to the full the capability that is specific to humans, i.e.,\nour rationality or intellect, and there are many echoes of\nNicomachean Ethics X, but his explanation of why the\nphilosopher will act virtuously is not easily compatible with the\nAristotelian insistence that ethics is not a theoretical science and\nthat habituation is central to making people virtuous.\n\nThe happiness that Boethius is concerned with is entirely\nthis-worldly. A future life is only mentioned once, in an ambiguous\nremark to the effect that the more one manages to obtain the happiness\nthat reason tells us is possible in this life, the closer one is to\nthe happiness that faith makes us expect in a/the life to come. It\ncould mean that virtuous behavior betters one\u2019s chances on\ndoomsday, but it could also just mean that the philosopher\u2019s\nhappy contemplative life is the closest approximation to the bliss of\nthe beatific vision.\n\nOne of the theses condemned in 1277 is a slightly altered, but\nbasically correct quotation of a passage in De summo bono. It\nsays: \n\n\nThat there is no more excellent state [of life] (status) than\nto dedicate oneself to philosophy. \n\n\nNo reason is given why it is wrong, but the bishop and his men\nprobably thought that a life in holy orders or as a theologian ought\nto be considered a more excellent status.\n",
