    "main_text": "Some Criticisms of Interventionist Accounts\n14. Some Recent Positive Developments.\n\nThe material above has largely focused on the use of interventionist\nor manipulability based ideas to provide an interpretation of causal\nclaims, with little attention paid to the use of these ideas in causal\ninference\u2014that is, inference to causal relationships from\nexperimental and non-experimental data. The latter is an important\nsubject in its own right. Roughly speaking, if one thinks of causal\nclaims as claims about the outcomes of possible manipulations or\nexperiments, then this suggests distinctive ways of conceptualizing\nproblems of causal inference from non-experimental data: these may be\nconceptualized as problems of inferring from such data (and other\nassumptions) what the outcome of a possible experiment would be\nwithout doing the experiment in question. This point of view can used\nto motivate or rationalize the use of such procedures as instrumental\nvariables or regression discontinuity designs\u2014see, e.g., Angrist\nand Pischke 2009 for econometric applications of these ideas.\n\nAnother important extension of interventionist ideas, also with a\nfocus on inference but containing conceptual innovations as well is\ndue to Eberhardt (Eberhardt 2007, Eberhardt and Scheines 2007). These\nauthors generalize the notion of intervention in two ways. First, they\nconsider interventions that do not deterministically fix the value of\nvariable(s) intervened on but rather merely impose a probability\ndistribution on those variables. Second, they explore the use of what\nhave come to be called \u201csoft\u201d interventions. These are\ninterventions that unlike the fully surgical (\u201chard\u201d)\ninterventions considered above (both Pearl\u2019s setting\ninterventions and the notion associated with\n M1\u2013M4),\n do not completely break the previously existing relationships between\nthe variable \\(X\\) intervened on and its causes \\(C\\) but rather\nsupply an exogenous source \\(I\\) of variation to \\(X\\) that leaves its\nrelations to \\(C\\) intact but where \\(I\\) is uncorrelated with \\(C\\).\nCertain experiments are naturally modeled in this way. For example, in\nan experiment in which subjects are randomly given various amounts of\nadditional income (besides whatever income they have from other\nsources) this additional income functions as a soft, rather than a\nhard intervention. Soft interventions may be possible in practice or\nin principle in certain situations in which hard interventions are\nnot. Eberhardt 2007 and Eberhardt and Scheines 2007 explore what can\nbe learned from various combinations of soft and hard, indeterministic\nand deterministic interventions together with non-experimental data in\nvarious contexts. Unsurprisingly each kind of intervention and\nassociated data have both advantages and limitations from the point of\nview of inference.\n",
