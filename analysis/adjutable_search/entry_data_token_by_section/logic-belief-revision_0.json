    "main_text": "Introduction || History\n1.1 History\n\nBelief revision (belief change, belief dynamics) has been recognized\nas a subject of its own since the middle of the 1980s. It grew out of\ntwo converging research traditions.\n\nOne of these emerged in computer science. Since the beginning of\ncomputing, programmers have developed procedures by which databases\ncan be updated. The development of Artificial Intelligence inspired\ncomputer scientists to construct more sophisticated models of database\nupdating. The truth maintenance systems developed by Jon Doyle (1979)\nwere important in this development. One of the most significant\ntheoretical contributions was a 1983 paper by Ronald Fagin, Jeffrey\nUllman and Moshe Vardi, in which they introduced the notion of\ndatabase priorities. \n\nThe second of these two research traditions is philosophical. In a\nwide sense, belief change has been a subject of philosophical\nreflection since antiquity. In the twentieth century, philosophers\nhave discussed the mechanisms by which scientific theories develop,\nand they have proposed criteria of rationality for revisions of\nprobability assignments. Beginning in the 1970s, a more focused\ndiscussion has taken place on the requirements of rational belief\nchange. Two milestones can be pointed out. The first was a series of\nstudies conducted by Isaac Levi in the 1970s (Levi 1977, 1980). Levi\nposed many of the problems that have since then been major concerns in\nthis field of research. He also provided much of the basic formal\nframework. William Harper\u2019s (1977) work from the same period has\nalso had a lasting influence. \n\nThe next milestone was the AGM model, so called after its three\noriginators, Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n, Peter G\u00e4rdenfors, and\nDavid Makinson (1985). Alchourr\u00f3n and Makinson had previously\ncooperated in studies of changes in legal codes (Alchourr\u00f3n and\nMakinson 1981, 1982). G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s early work was concerned\nwith the connections between belief change and conditional sentences\n(G\u00e4rdenfors 1978, 1981). With combined forces the three wrote a\npaper that provided a new, much more general and versatile formal\nframework for studies of belief change. (On the history of their joint\nwork, see Makinson 2003 and G\u00e4rdenfors 2011.) Since the paper was\npublished in the Journal of Symbolic Logic in 1985, its major\nconcepts and constructions have been the subject of significant\nelaboration and development. The AGM model and developments that have\ngrown out of it still form the core of belief revision theory.\n",
