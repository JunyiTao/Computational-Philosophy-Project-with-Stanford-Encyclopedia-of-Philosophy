Concluding Remarks\nThe epistemic view on games is that players should be seen as\nindividual decision makers, choosing what to do on the basis of their\nown preferences and the information they have in specific\ninformational contexts. What decision they will make\u2014the\ndescriptive question\u2014or what decision they should make\u2014the\nnormative question, depends on the decision-theoretic choice rule that\nthe player use, or should use, in a given context. We conclude with\ntwo general methodological issues about epistemic game theory and some\npointers to further reading.\n7.1 What is an epistemic game theory trying to accomplish?\nCommon knowledge of rationality is an informal assumption that game\ntheorists, philosophers and other social scientists often appeal to\nwhen analyzing social interactive situations. The epistemic program in\ngame theory demonstrates that there are many ways to understand what\nexactly it means to assume that there is \u201ccommon\nknowledge/belief of rationality\u201d in a game situation.\nBroadly speaking, much of the epistemic game theory literature is\nfocused on two types of projects. The goal of the first project is to\nmap out the relationship between different mathematical\nrepresentations of what the players know and believe about each other\nin a game situation. Research along these lines not only raises\ninteresting technical questions about how to compare and contrast\ndifferent mathematical models of the players\u2019 epistemic states,\nbut it also highlights the benefits and limits of an epistemic\nanalysis of games. The second project addresses the nature of rational\nchoice in game situations. The importance of this project is nicely\nexplained by Wolfgang Spohn:\n\n\u2026game theory\u2026is, to put it strongly, confused about\nthe rationality concept appropriate to it, its assumptions about its\nsubjects (the players) are very unclear, and, as a consequence, it is\nunclear about the decision rules to be applied\u2026.The basic\ndifficulty in defining rational behavior in game situations is the\nfact that in general each player\u2019s strategy will depend on his\nexpectations about the other players\u2019 strategies. Could we\nassume that his expectations were given, then his problem of strategy\nchoice would become an ordinary maximization problem: he could simply\nchoose a strategy maximizing his own payoff on the assumption that the\nother players would act in accordance with his given expectations. But\nthe point is that game theory cannot regard the players\u2019\nexpectations about each other\u2019s behavior as given; rather, one\nof the most important problems for game theory is precisely to decide\nwhat expectations intelligent players can rationally entertain about\nother intelligent players\u2019 behavior. (Spohn 1982: 267)\n\nMuch of the work in epistemic game theory can be viewed as an\nattempt to use precise representations of the players\u2019 knowledge\nand beliefs to help resolve some of the confusion alluded to in the\nabove quote.\n7.2 Alternatives to maximizing expected utility\nIn an epistemic analysis of a game, the specific recommendations or\npredictions for the players\u2019 choices are derived from\ndecision-theoretic choice rules. Maximization of expected utility, for\ninstance, underlies most of the results in the contemporary literature\non the epistemic foundations of game theory. From a methodological\nperspective, however, the choice rule that the modeler assumes the\nplayers are following is simply a parameter that can be varied. In\nrecent years, there have been some initial attempts to develop\nepistemic analyses with alternative choice rules, for\ninstance minregret Halpern & Pass (2009).\n7.3 Further reading\nThe reader interested in more extensive coverage of all or some of\nthe topics discussed in this entry should consult the following\narticles and books.\n\nLogic in Games by Johan van Benthem: This book uses the\ntools of modal logic broadly conceived to discuss many of the issues\nraised in this entry (2014, MIT Press).\nThe Language of Game Theory by Adam Brandenburger: A\ncollection of Brandenburger\u2019s key papers on epistemic game\ntheory (2014, World Scientific Series in Economic Theory).\nEpistemic Game Theory by Eddie Dekel and Marciano\nSiniscalchi: A survey paper aimed at economists covering the main\ntechnical results of epistemic game theory (2014, Available online).\nEpistemic Game Theory: Reasoning and Choice by\nAndr\u00e9s Perea: A non-technical introduction to epistemic game\ntheory (2012, Cambridge University Press).\nThe Bounds of Reason: Game Theory and the Unification of the\nBehavioral Sciences by Herbert Gintis: This book offers a broad\noverview of the social and behavioral science using the ideas of\nepistemic game theory (2009, Princeton University Press).\n",
