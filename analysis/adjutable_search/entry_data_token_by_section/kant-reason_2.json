    "main_text": "Theoretical reason: reason\u2019s cognitive role and limitations || Reason in science\n1.2 Reason in science\n\nThe principle of reasoned unity also applies to scientific judgments\nand theories. However, it takes a more complex form, since science\nseeks universal laws.\n\nKant claims that reason is \u201cthe origin of certain concepts and\nprinciples\u201d (A299/B355) independent from those of sensibility\nand understanding. Kant refers to these as \u201ctranscendental\nideas\u201d (A311/B368) or \u201cideas of [pure] reason\u201d\n(A669/B697). He also defines reason as a \u201cfaculty of\nprinciples\u201d (A299/B356). But what are these concepts and\nprinciples, and can they be justified? Since Kant also argues that\n\u201cideas of reason\u201d often lead to error and contradiction,\nthese are serious questions.\n\nOne sort of error arises when we claim knowledge of objects beyond\nsensory experience, such as God or the soul. Another sort arises when\nwe form \u201ctranscendental ideas.\u201d We may try to\nconceptualize the ultimate basis of everything that exists, such as\nthe universe as a whole. Kant refers to these as \u201cworld\nwholes\u201d or cosmological ideas. As discussed in a moment\n (\u00a71.3),\n when we claim objective knowledge about these, we fall into\ncontradictions or \u201cantinomies.\u201d For example, Kant holds\nthat we can argue equally well for the opposing claims: that the\nuniverse has a beginning in time and that it does not.\n\nScientific enquiry assumes that the world forms a well-ordered,\nsystematic unity where all events can be subsumed under causal laws.\nThis is not just the idea that events have causes\u2014an inescapable\nassumption that Kant refers to as a category of the understanding.\nRather, the claim is that universal laws underlie all particular\nrelations of cause and effect. This is what Kant has in mind when he\nspeaks of the \u201cunity of reason\u201d in the first\nCritique. (See e.g. A302/B359, A665/B693, A680/B780.)\n\nAs an illustration, consider Copernicus\u2019s hypothesis that the\nearth orbits the sun. This hypothesis contradicts our everyday\nperceptions\u2014perceptions that we normally rely on without\nquestion. Historically, Galileo\u2019s observations were a turning\npoint. The telescope gave a much more extensive picture of planets and\nstars, casting doubt on our everyday perspective. Although a new\nscientific tool is involved (the telescope), the reasoning is quite\nordinary. In the face of inconsistent appearances, we must decide\nwhich perspective to endorse\u2014just as we may judge that an\nimpression is merely an optical illusion, or a dream is only a\n dream.[7]\n\nFor Kant\u2019s account of scientific reasoning, Newton is more\nimportant (Bxxii n; cf.\n \u00a71.4\n below). Newton\u2019s laws of gravity unify Copernicus\u2019s\nhypothesis and Galileo\u2019s observations\u2014and much more\nbesides (A663/B691). The laws are universal: they extend to all\nheavenly objects, not only the sun\u2019s motion relative to the\nearth.\n\nBut we can never experience all events. However extensive our\nexperiences may be, and however many people\u2019s experiences we\ndraw on, experience is finite. As such, it can never justify the\nprinciple that laws are genuinely universal, or that these laws will\ncontinue to hold in the\n future.[8]\n Kant argues that reason is justified in adopting these principles\n(and others). However, he makes a subtle distinction. These principles\nshould guide scientific inquiry\u2014in Kant\u2019s term, they are\n\u201cregulative.\u201d But they do not provide knowledge\nof the world\u2014as Kant puts it, they are not\n\u201cconstitutive.\u201d (See e.g., Buchdahl 1992; Friedman 1992c;\n Kant\u2019s theory of judgment,\n \u00a74.2.)\n\nFor Kant, the categories of the understanding are the paradigm example\nof constitutive ideas. For example, the category of causation\nstructures all our knowledge. We do not perceive cause and effect\ndirectly. Instead, experience is only possible because we\nassume events have causes. (See\n Kant and Hume on causality\n for more detail.) Although we can make mistakes about specific\ncauses, we also have the following knowledge about cause and effect:\nwe know that every event has a cause. The category of cause\nand effect constitutes experience\u2014it enables us to\nexperience the world.\n\nBy contrast, regulative principles govern our investigations, without\noffering any guarantee as to what we will find. Science seeks the\ngreatest possible completeness and systematicity (cf. Guyer 1989 &\n2006, Abela 2006, Mudd 2017). Although scientists often pursue highly\nspecialized inquiries, science also has a regulative goal. It\nmust integrate all findings under the most all-encompassing laws.\nNewton\u2019s laws have been modified by general relativity, for\nexample, pointing to the open-ended, \u201cregulative\u201d nature\nof this quest. Likewise, scientists are still looking for a\nsatisfactory way to integrate general relativity with quantum\n mechanics.[9]\n\nWe cannot know in advance how far science will succeed, or that nature\nis constituted as wholly law-like. This would represent a\n\u201cconstitutive principle,\u201d a \u201ccosmological\u201d\nknowledge claim which goes beyond any possible experiences. Instead,\nthe principle of seeking law-like unity represents a\n\u201cmaxim\u201d or regulative principle of reason\n(A666/B694). Rather than determining what science must find, such\nprinciples guide scientific practice.\n\nKant\u2019s account of science, and especially the role of\n\u201cteleological\u201d or purposive judgment, is further developed\nin the Critique of the Power of Judgment. See Guyer 1990,\nFreudiger 1996, and Nuzzo 2005, as well as\n Kant\u2019s aesthetics and teleology\n (\u00a73). On Kant\u2019s account of science more generally, see\nWartenberg 1992, Buchdahl 1992, Friedman 1992b & 2013, Mudd 2016\nand Breitenbach 2018. On reason and science, see Neiman 1994: Ch. 2\nand Grier 2001: Ch. 8. The entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophy of science\n considers Kant\u2019s view of the natural sciences, especially\nphysics.\n",
