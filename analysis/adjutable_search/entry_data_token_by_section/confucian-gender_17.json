Few publications outside the\nChinese-comparative philosophical communities have explored any\nfeminist potential in non-western intellectual traditions including\nConfucianism to address women\u2019s issues, concerns and experiences\nin the contemporary world. Non-western philosophies, if included at\nall, in feminist theorizing serve more as negative examples\nillustrating how else things could possibly go wrong for\n\u201cthird-world\u201d women, instead of serving as positive\nconceptual resources for women\u2019s liberation from gender-based\noppression.\n\nDespite the lack of positive engagement from the feminist communities\nwith Confucian philosophy, the Chinese-comparative communities,\nnevertheless, persist. Around the mid-2010s, the Chinese-comparative\ncommunities began to go beyond the issue of compatibility between care\nethics and Confucian ren and took a step further to\narticulate positive Confucian approaches to address women\u2019s\nconcerns, issues, and experiences in the contemporary world, such as\nabortion, same-sex marriage, mothering, ecofeminism, domestic\nviolence, elder care, etc. (Butnor & McWeeny 2014; Olberding 2015;\nPang-White 2016; Foust & Tan 2016; Yuan 2019). The field of\ncomparative feminist philosophy exploring the feminist potential in\nConfucianism is the latest attempt to reconceptualize the complex\nconnection between gender and Confucian philosophy laying the\nfoundation for an inclusive, transnational, transcultural feminist\ntheory.\n",
