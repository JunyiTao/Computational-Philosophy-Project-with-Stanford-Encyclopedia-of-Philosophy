Scholarly uses of the term\n\u2018atomism\u2019 range over mereological theories in widely\ndifferent contexts (Zilioli 2021); not all possible senses of the term\nare discussed here. Several ancient atomist theories are treated in\nmore depth in other articles in this encyclopedia: the reader is\nreferred to individual entries for detailed discussions by the\nrelevant experts (see the list of related entries at the end of this\narticle).\n\nThe term \u2018atomism\u2019 is sometimes understood to refer to\ntheories explaining changes in the material world by the\nrearrangements of minute particles of matter, or to the idea that any\nkind of magnitude\u2014geometrical extension, time and space\u2014is\ncomposed of indivisible parts. Theories of mathematical minima were\nformulated in response to paradoxes like those of Zeno of Elea (early\n5th c. BCE) about infinite divisibility of magnitudes.\nHowever, theories of smallest parts could be introduced for reasons\nquite distinct from mathematical problems about divisibility: atomism\nin classical Indian philosophy seems to have been motivated by the\ndesire to reflect the categories used in analysis of the metaphysical\nstructure of reality shown in language (Carpenter 2021). While in the\nGreek tradition, atoms were held to be eternal and indestructible\nparticles that persist through changes in the visible world of\nexperience, that is not always a feature of ancient atomist theories.\nSome Indian philosophical systems held that atoms are created and\nsubject to transformation or destruction, or that they are only\nmomentary features of experience. Atomists from monotheistic\nschools\u2014including medieval Islamic kal\u0101m\nphilosophers and seventeenth century figures like Pierre\nGassendi\u2014adapted atomist theories to allow for the creation and\ndestruction of atoms by God.

Atomism in Classical Indian Philosophy\n\nThe beginnings of atomism in classical Indian philosophy are difficult\nto ascertain, but it likely has origins several centuries before the\ncommon era. Two distinct systems that regard Vedic texts as\nauthoritative, Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, favoured atomist\naccounts of the material world. Quite different atomist theories are\nfound in Buddhist and Jaina systems. Other Indian philosophical\nsystems were critical of atomism, arguing instead for an idealist\naccount of experience. The Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu (5th c.\nCE), whose earlier Treasury of Metaphysics is often\nconsidered an atomist account, critiqued atomism in his Twenty\nVerses.\n\nThe terms translated \u2018atom\u2019 in Indian philosophy\n(a\u1e47u, param\u0101\u1e47u) refer\nprimarily to the smallness of parts (Gangopadhyaya 1980): this notion\nof smallness, found in the Upanishads, was developed into atomist\ntheories in the commentary tradition. A classic argument for atomism\nreasons by analogy from the fact that perceptible objects seem to be\ncomposed of parts (Chatterjee 2017). Yet, the argument ran, bodies\ncannot be infinitely divisible because this would lead to the\nparadoxical result that a mountain and a mustard seed would be equal\nin size. This rebuttal\u2014closely echoed in Islamic\ndebates\u2014is based on the kind of paradox about summation of\ninfinite series also found in the ancient Greek tradition (Bhaduri\n1947, 55). The comparison of mountain and mustard seed was also\ndeployed to argue that the concepts of small and large would be\nindistinguishable unless smallness had a defined magnitude\n(Gangopadhyaya 1980, 29).\n\nNot all Indian atomist theories regard minima as substantial entities.\nCarpenter (2021) describes the trope theory of Vasubandhu as\n\u2018absolute atomism\u2019: this characterization challenges the\nnotion that atomism canonically centres on the positing of enduring\nparticles. Instead, the focus is on minimal units in time as well as\nspace, which are simultaneously minimal components of ontological\nunits and not substance-attribute composites.\n\nA tradition that the Greek atomist Democritus was acquainted with the\nideas of the \u2018gymnosophists\u2019 or \u2018naked wise\nmen\u2019 of India is difficult to authenticate. Claims that Indian\natomism was shaped by Greek influences (Keith 1921, 17) are uncommon\nin recent scholarship. The possibility that Islamic atomism was\nimpacted by debates in classical Indian philosophy has been more\nextensively considered, particularly given parallel arguments and the\nshared view that atoms never exist in isolation (Pines 1997; Wolfson\n1976). Another feature common to both traditions is a willingness to\nascribe sensible qualities to atoms, in contrast to Greek atomist\ntheories. Indian Buddhist scholars introduced atomist theories to\nChina from the second century CE onward, but they seem not to have\nbeen adopted into ancient Chinese natural philosophy (Needham 1969,\n22).\n1.1 Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika systems developed separately,\nthe former focusing on epistemological issues and the latter on\nontology. Nonetheless, there were enough overlap and later\nreconciliations between them that scholars often consider their\npicture of the natural world together. Both schools developed as\ntraditions of commentary on the Upanishads, dating back to 800 BCE\n(Phillips 1995). In contrast to the Buddhist tradition, atoms in these\nsystems of thought were regarded as external material substances that\npersist through change, although\u2014in line with the teachings of\nthe Vedic scriptures\u2014the atoms were thought to be created.\nImportant figures in the textual tradition include Ka\u1e47\u0101da,\nregarded as founder of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school;\nPr\u00e1sastap\u0101da, author of the first surviving commentary;\nGautama (ca. 150 CE); V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (ca. 400 CE). The work of\nUdayana (11th c. CE) and Ga\u00f1ge\u015ba (c. 1325 CE) gave rise to\na new school, Navya- Ny\u0101ya, that largely merged the two\ntraditions (Matilal 1977; Phillips 1995; Ganeri 2019).\n\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism developed in constant dialogue\nwith other Indian philosophical schools: in a context where Buddhism\noffered a compelling narrative of personal salvation through\ndetachment from the unrealities of the experienced world, some Hindu\nphilosophers responded by bolstering their case for the realism of the\nexperienced world, and real atomic substances were invoked to explain\nboth mental and physical events (Ganeri 2011, 167\u20138). The idea\nthat experienced properties inhere in real external substances was\nused to account for intersubjective agreement about the external\nworld.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory posited different kinds of\natoms for each of the elements earth, water, air and fire, in contrast\nto the Jaina theory that there is a single homogenous matter out of\nwhich everything is composed (Gangopadhyaya 1980). Atoms were regarded\nas substances and bearers of different attributes. Different clusters\nof properties were ascribed to atoms of different kinds (Dasgupta\n1987; Chatterjee 2017). In contrast to the Greek atomists, who denied\nthat sensible properties really inhere in atoms at all, atoms of\ndifferent elements are thought to have perceptible properties, such as\ncold for water atoms. Some theorists allow for the possibility of\naltering the fundamental properties of atoms by heating (Thakar 2003).\nFor atomists in the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika systems, who held\nthat the atoms are made of fundamentally different matter, there is a\nproblem of explaining how properties of one kind of atom can affect an\natom of a different kind, i.e. how the viscosity of water atoms is\nable to combine with earth atoms and to change their consistency\n(Gangopadhyaya 1980, 34).\n\nAtoms combine into dyads and triads before they aggregate into bodies\nof a kind that can be perceived. The theory however faced a question\nhow atoms can combine, if they are indeed partless: unless we can\ndistinguish different parts to an atom, it is difficult to see how\nthey can be said to be next to one another\u2014side by\nside\u2014any more than mathematical points can be said to join\ntogether rather than collapsing into a single point. The response is\nto deny the analogy to points, since atoms are tangible entities and\ntwo of them cannot occupy the same place (Bhaduri 1947, 63), thus\natoms do not lose their identity when they aggregate. Another approach\nto the problem is due to Vasubandhu in the Buddhist tradition (see\nCarpenter 2021).\n\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism also faced the challenge that\ntheir theory was only based on logical inference and could not be\nconfirmed by experience (Bhaduri 1947, 58). In the atomism of Gautama,\nrecognizing the reality of composites is important to secure the basis\nfor knowledge, since atoms themselves are too small to be seen.\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana supports this conclusion empirically, pointing\nout that a forest may be visible from a distance where the individual\ntrees are not (Sarkar 2021). In an ongoing controversy with Buddhist\nphilosophers over the reality of composite entities, Ny\u0101ya\natomists denied that we are aware of composites only indirectly or by\nmeans of awareness of individual parts (Matilal 1986, 268).\n\nNy\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomists held that the world was\ncreated when order was imposed on pre-existing matter: the motion of\natoms was ascribed to a divine source. Their analysis of motion and\nits causes employs concepts that have been compared to modern notions\nof force (Kumar 2019). Although the systems had naturalistic leanings,\nunusual motions such as the action of a magnet might be\nascribed\u2014as it was in the European middle ages\u2014to the\nmoral condition of human agents (Matilal 1977, 58). The organization\nof atoms was cited as a proof for the existence of God by the 11th\ncentury CE atomist Udayana (Gangopadhyaya 1980, 36). The mind and self\nor soul\u2014like time and space\u2014was regarded as a distinct\ncategory from material elements, a distinction traced back to the\nclassical scriptures.\n1.2 Buddhist atomist theories\n\nDeveloped in the centuries after the Buddha (6th c. BCE), Buddhist\nphilosophies, especially the Abhidhamma school, systematized the\nunderlying philosophy of a body of texts that focused on human lived\nexperience. The entities in Buddhist theory that are considered\natomistic are not substances but momentary events, dharmas or\ndhammas: \u2018the constituents of sentient experience, the\nirreducible \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d that make up one\u2019s\nworld\u2019 (Ronkin 2005, 41). These atomic particulars can be mental\nor physical, and have been compared to trope theories or process\nmetaphysics in contemporary scholarship. Unlike theories of atomic\nsubstances, Buddhist atoms are not composed of multiple properties. In\ncontrast to Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomists, Buddhists deny\nthat there is an underlying substance uniting different properties\nlike the colour and the weight of a jar (Bhaduri 1947). Atomic\nproperty-instances do not occur in isolation, any more than nouns and\nverbs made sense alone.\n\nDespite the phenomenological character that atoms sometimes bear in\nBuddhist thought, questions about compositionality occur which\nparallel issues in other ancient atomist theories (Goodman 2004,\nCarpenter 2021). Vai\u015be\u1e63ika thought\u2014which accepted\ncategories like substance and soul\u2014impacted the articulation of\nAbhidhamma ontology, an articulation that sometimes led to charges of\n\u2018ontologization,\u2019 i.e. of moving away from the\nexperiential focus of Buddhist thought towards a more systematic\nmetaphysics (Ronkin 2005). Material atoms are first found in Buddhist\nthought in the work of Dharmasri (2nd c. CE), and feature in the work\nof Vasubandhu and Sanghabhadra (both 5th c. CE) (Ronkin 2005, 56).\n\nBuddhist versions of atomism differ from\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika versions on the status of the wholes\ncomposed of atoms, with the former treating composites as mere\naggregates, the latter regarding them as distinct entities in their\nown right (Sarkar 2021). The Buddhist emphasis on the transitory\nnature of material reality was part of the motivation for their\ninterest in atomist explanations (Gangopadhyaya 1980, 52; Ronkin 2005,\n59). In the enumeration of different kinds of mental states, notions\nthat correspond to materiality are included, although earth, water,\nwind and fire are typically considered to be merely mental constructs\nin Buddhist thought.\n\nAtoms were nonetheless used in materialist explanations, which account\nfor physical phenomena such as the combination of different elements\nto form macroscopic materials. Because we appear to see visible\nparticles of dust, or rays of light shining on glass or mirrors, it\nseemed reasonable to suppose that interactions too small to perceive\nproduce observed changes in the macroscopic world (Dasgupta 1987).\nHeat and light were thought to be produced by minute corpuscles\nentering other bodies. Buddhist atomism regarded atomic properties\nsuch as solidity, heat and motion as producing perceptible changes at\nthe macroscopic level (Gangopadhyaya 1980, 13\u201314). Even with\nnon-material atoms, the question of their occupation of space was\nconsidered: Matilal suggests that tangibility may have been regarded\nas a latent property of the atoms, which emerges like visibility when\nthey cluster (Matilal 1986, 361). Different Buddhist schools disagreed\non the answer to these questions.\n\nProblems about the possibility of motion, developed especially by the\nBuddhist N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (2nd c. CE), prompted responses in other\nschools of thought (Matilal 1977, 79; Dasgupta 1987). Although the\npersistence of macroscopic bodies might be illusory, there were\ndiscussions about the momentum or persisting tendencies of moving\nbodies, the different directions exhibited by these tendencies in a\nrotating wheel, and the cohesion of particles within moving\nbodies.\n1.3 Jaina atomism\n\nJaina atomist theory treats matter, space and time as composed of\nindivisible smallest parts (Pines 1987). Although natural philosophy\nmay not have occupied a large role in Jaina thought, the reason for\npositing atoms is as the ultimate cause of perceived physical\nqualities (Nyayavijayaji 1998). They posited a homogenous matter out\nof which every material body is composed, in contrast to the atomism\nof the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and Buddhist systems, which\nposited atoms of different kinds for each of the elements earth,\nwater, fire and air (Gangopadhyaya 1980). Atoms thus bring different\nproperties to aggregates, as, for example, the addition of water atoms\ncauses earth atoms to stick together (Dasgupta 1987). The tendency of\natoms to cohere into aggregates was thought to come from their own\nnature and not from external pressures (Nyayavijayaji 1998).\n\nJaina atomists also regarded soul as a distinct kind of entity,\nalthough they held that material atoms can percolate into soul and\naffect it. Space was also treated as a distinct kind of substance\n(Mehta 1954). Jaina tradition claims to have been the oldest atomist\nsystem and to have inspired Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism, although\nrecent scholarship suggests that the reverse is true (Matilal 1977,\n60; Thakar 2003, 7\u20138, 450).\n2. Ancient Greek Atomism\n\nAncient Greek atomists developed a systematic and comprehensive\nnatural philosophy accounting for the origins of everything from the\ninteraction of indivisible bodies, as these atoms\u2014which have\nonly a few intrinsic properties like size and shape\u2014strike\nagainst one another, rebound and interlock in an infinite void. In\nboth its Democritean and its Epicurean versions, Greek atomism\neschewed teleological explanation and denied divine intervention or\ndesign, regarding every composite of atoms as produced purely by\nmaterial interactions of bodies, and accounting for the perceived\nproperties of macroscopic bodies as produced by these same atomic\ninteractions. Ancient Greek atomists formulated views on ethics,\ntheology, political philosophy and epistemology consistent with this\nphysical system. This powerful and consistent materialism was regarded\nby Aristotle as a chief competitor to teleological natural philosophy;\nfollowing his criticisms, the theory was reformulated by Epicurus and\nhad a second life as the philosophy of a school devoted to the pursuit\nof tranquillity and a communal life of simple pleasures.\n2.1 Leucippus and Democritus\n\nLeucippus (5th c. BCE) is usually credited with inventing atomism in\nthe Greek tradition. According to a passing remark by the geographer\nStrabo, Posidonius (1st c. BCE Stoic philosopher) reported\nthat ancient Greek atomism can be traced back to a figure known as\nMoschus or Mochus of Sidon, who lived at the time of the Trojan wars.\nThis report was given credence in the seventeenth century: the\nCambridge Platonist Henry More traced the origins of ancient atomism\nback, via Pythagoras and Moschus, to Moses. This theologically\nmotivated view appealed to those who saw revelation as the source of\nall truth and wanted to trace ancient Greek ideas to Biblical sources.\nAn ancient Greek source commenting on the travels of Democritus\ncredits his mathematical interests to time spent among Egyptian\ngeometers and suggests that he may have learned from the philosophers\nof India.\n\nIn 1877, Tann\u00e9ry argued that Zeno of Elea\u2019s arguments\nabout divisibility would make most sense if formulated in response to\nan atomist theory supposedly held by some early Pythagoreans.\nTann\u00e9ry\u2019s thesis has been thoroughly challenged since\nthen: most scholars instead consider atomism to be one of a number of\npositions formulated in response to the arguments of Parmenides and\nZeno (first half of the fifth century).\n\nLittle is known about Leucippus, while the ideas of his student\nDemocritus\u2014who is said to have taken over and systematized his\nteacher\u2019s theory\u2014are known from a large number of reports\nand fragments quoted by others. These early atomists theorized that\nthe two fundamental and oppositely characterized constituents of the\nnatural world are indivisible bodies\u2014atoms\u2014and void. The\nlatter is described simply as nothing, or as the negation of being.\nAtoms were said to be intrinsically unchangeable; they can move about\nin the void and combine into different clusters, which give rise to\nthe macroscopic bodies of the perceived world. Because all macroscopic\nobjects are in fact combinations of atoms, everything in the world of\nour experience is transitory and subject to dissolution while the\natoms themselves persist through all time.\n\nAccording to Aristotle\u2019s presentation (On Generation and\nCorruption I 8), the motivation for the first postulation of\nindivisible bodies is to answer a metaphysical puzzle about the\npossibility of change and multiplicity. Parmenides had argued that any\ndifferentiation or change in Being implies that \u2018what is\nnot\u2019 either is or comes to be. Although there are problems in\ninterpreting Parmenides\u2019 precise meaning, he was understood to\nhave raised a problem about how change can be possible without\nsomething coming from nothing. Several Presocratics formulated, in\nresponse, philosophical systems in which change is not considered to\nrequire something coming into being from complete nonexistence, but\nrather the arrangement of pre-existing elements into new combinations.\nThe atomists held that, the atoms are unchangeable and contain no\ninternal differentiation of a sort that would allow for division.\n\nBy positing indivisible bodies, the atomists were also thought to be\nanswering Zeno\u2019s paradoxes about the impossibility of motion.\nZeno had argued that, if magnitudes can be divided to infinity, it\nwould be impossible for motion to occur. The problem seems to be that\na body moving would have to traverse an infinite number of spaces in a\nfinite time. By supposing that the atoms form the lowest limit to\ndivision, the atomists escape from this dilemma: a total space\ntraversed has only a finite number of parts. As it is unclear whether\nthe earliest atomists understood the atoms to be physically or\ntheoretically indivisible, they may not have made the distinction.\nMakin\u2019s argument that atomic indivisibility is based on the\nhomogeneity of substance and not smallness explains why Democritus\nallowed for the possibility of even very large atoms (Makin 1993,\n55).\n\nAtoms can differ in size, shape, order and position; they move about\nin the void, and\u2014depending on their shape\u2014some can\ntemporarily bond with one another by means of tiny hooks and barbs on\ntheir surfaces. Thus the shape of individual atoms affects the\nmacroscopic texture of clusters of atoms, which may be fluid and\nyielding or firm and resistant, depending on the amount of void space\nbetween and the coalescence of the atomic shapes. The texture of\nsurfaces and the relative density and fragility of different materials\nare also accounted for by the same means. Atoms cannot fuse, but\nrather repel one another when they collide. Observations about the\ntendencies of bodies bumping one another were frequently exploited to\nexplain the apparently patterned motions of macroscopic bodies in the\nvisible world.\n\nThe atomists accounted for perception by means of films of atoms\nsloughed off from their surfaces by external objects, and entering and\nimpacting the sense organs. They tried to account for all sensible\neffects by means of contact, and regarded all sense perceptions as\ncaused by the properties of the atoms making up the films acting on\nthe atoms of animals\u2019 sense organs. Perceptions of color are\ncaused by the \u2018turning\u2019 or position of the atoms; tastes\nare caused by the shape of the atoms contacting the tongue, e.g.,\nbitter tastes by the tearing caused by sharp atoms; feelings of heat\nare ascribed to friction. Heat itself is said to be caused by the\nadmixture of tiny fire atoms. Democritus considered thought to be a\nmaterial process involving the local rearrangement of bodies, just as\nmuch as is perception.\n\nA famous quotation from Democritus distinguishes between perceived\nproperties like colors and tastes, which exist only \u2018by\nconvention,\u2019 in contrast to the reality, which is atoms and\nvoid. However, he apparently recognized an epistemological problem for\nan empiricist philosophy that nonetheless regards the objects of sense\nas unreal. In another famous quotation, the senses accuse the mind of\noverthrowing them, although mind is dependent on the senses. The\naccusation is that, by developing an atomist theory that undermines\nthe basis for confidence in sense perception, thought has in effect\nundercut its own foundation on knowledge gained through the senses.\nDemocritus sometimes seems to doubt or deny the possibility of\nknowledge.\n\nThe early Greek atomists try to account for the formation of the\nnatural world by means of their simple ontology of atoms and void\nalone. Leucippus held that there are an infinite number of atoms\nmoving for all time in an infinite void, and that these can form into\ncosmic systems or kosmoi by means of a whirling motion which\nrandomly establishes itself in a large enough cluster of atoms. It is\ncontroversial whether atoms are thought to have weight as an intrinsic\nproperty, causing them all to fall in some given direction, or whether\nweight is simply a tendency for atoms (which otherwise move in any and\nevery direction, except when struck) to move towards the centre of a\nsystem, created by the whirling of the cosmic vortices. When a vortex\nis formed, it creates a membrane of atoms at its outer edge, and the\nouter band of atoms catches fire, forming a sun and stars. These\nkosmoi are impermanent, and are not accounted for by purpose\nor design. The earth is described as a flat cylindrical drum at the\ncenter of our cosmos.\n\nSpecies are not regarded as permanent abstract forms, but as chance\ncombinations of atoms. Living things are regarded as having a\npsych\u00ea or principle of life; this is identified with\nfiery atoms. Organisms are thought to reproduce by means of seed:\nDemocritus seems to have held that both parents produce seeds composed\nof fragments from each organ of their body. Whichever of the parts\ndrawn from the relevant organ of the parents predominates in the new\nmixture determines which characteristics are inherited by the\noffspring. Democritus is reported to have given an account of the\norigin of human beings from the earth. He is also said to be the\nfounder of a kind of cultural anthropology (Cole 1967), since his\naccount of the origin of the cosmos includes an account of the origin\nof human institutions, including language and social and political\norganization.\n\nA large group of reports about Democritus\u2019 views concern ethical\nmaxims: some scholars have tried to regard these as systematic or\ndependent on atomist physics, while others doubt the closeness of the\nconnection. Because several maxims stress the value of\n\u2018cheerfulness,\u2019 Democritus is sometimes portrayed as\n\u2018the laughing philosopher.\u2019 The frequent association\nbetween hedonism and atomism may stem from the denial of any source of\ngood other than immediate experience; the tendency to reduce\nexperience to the rubbing together of atoms may have contributed to\nthe impression that atomists are preoccupied with physical\npleasure.\n2.2 Plato, Platonists and Pythagoreans\n\nAlthough the Greek term atomos is most commony associated\nwith the solid and impenetrable bodies posited by Leucippus and\nDemocritus, Plato\u2019s Timaeus presents a different kind\nof physical theory based on indivisibles and was also regarded as a\nkind of atomism. Plato\u2019s discussion of the composition of solids\nfrom plane surfaces is sometimes thought to be based on fourth-century\nPythagorean theories. A fourth-century Pythagorean, Ecphantus,\ninterpreted the Pythagorean monads as indivisible bodies: he is\nreported to have been sympathetic to atomism of a kind similar to\nDemocritus\u2019.\n\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus elaborates an account of the world\nwherein the four different basic kinds of body\u2014earth, air, fire,\nand water\u2014are regular solids composed from plane figures:\nisosceles and scalene right-angled triangles. Because the same\ntriangles can form into different regular solids, the theory thus\nexplains how some of the elements can transform into one another, as\nwas widely believed. In this theory, it is the elemental triangles\ncomposing the solids that are regarded as indivisible, not the solids\nthemselves. When Aristotle discusses the hypothesis that the natural\nworld is composed of indivisibles, the two views he considers are\nthose of Plato and Democritus. Aristotle criticizes both Plato and\nfourth-century Pythagoreans for constructing natural bodies possessing\nweight from indivisible mathematical abstractions, whether plane\nsurfaces or numbers. It has been suggested that Plato accepted time\natoms, i.e., indivisible minima in time, but this is\ncontroversial.\n\nA treatise in the Aristotelian corpus probably not by Aristotle\nhimself (On Indivisible Lines) addresses and refutes a number\nof arguments offered for the existence of indivisible lines, without\nnaming their author. Plato\u2019s student Xenocrates (396\u2013314\nBCE), third head of the Academy, is reported to believe in indivisible\nlines, and he may well be the target of the Aristotelian treatise. One\nof the arguments attacked addresses a Zenonian problem about\ntraversing or touching in succession an infinite series of parts. The\nidea that there are indivisible lines offers an alternative to the\nview that any extended magnitude must be divisible to infinity. A\ndistinct argument claims that, if the physical elements composing a\nbody are regarded as the ultimate parts, they cannot be further\ndivisible. Although this does not argue for indivisible lines per\nse, it is used to suggest that the objects of sense as well as\nthose of thought must include things without parts.\n\nA further argument depends on thinking that opposite properties must\nhave opposite characteristics: if \u2018many\u2019 or\n\u2018large\u2019 things have infinite parts, it is argued, then\n\u2018few\u2019 or \u2018small\u2019 things must have only a\nfinite number of parts. It is then concluded that there must be a\nmagnitude without parts, apparently so that it is not further\ndivisible and thus composed of an infinite number of parts. The last\nargument depends on the idea that mathematicians talk of commensurable\nlines, and posit a single unit of measurement: this would not be\npossible if the unit were divisible, because the parts of the unit, if\nmeasured, would be measured by the unit measure and it would then turn\nout to contain multiple units within itself.\n\nIn late antiquity, the Neoplatonist Proclus defended Plato\u2019s\naccount against Aristotle\u2019s objections; these arguments are\npreserved in Simplicius\u2019 commentary on Aristotle\u2019s On\nthe Heavens. Simplicius credits the Pythagoreans as well as Plato\nwith a theory composing bodies from plane surfaces. Simplicius also\ncompares Pythagorean views to Democritean atomism, inasmuch as both\ntheories posit a cause for hot and cold rather than taking these to be\nfundamental principles, as the Aristotelians do.\n2.3 Minima Naturalia in Aristotelian Thought\n\nAn argument in Aristotle (Physics 1.4, 187b14\u201321) is\nsometimes taken by later writers as evidence that Aristotle allowed\nfor the existence of minima in natural things. Aristotle writes that\nthere is a smallest size of material substrate on which it is possible\nfor the form of a given natural tissue to occur. Blood and bone, say,\nare all materially composed of given proportions of earth, air, fire,\nand water: there needs to be a certain minimal amount of these\nmaterial components present before the form of blood or bone can\noccur. This doctrine\u2014while surely compatible with\nAristotle\u2019s view that the material components are nonetheless\ncontinuous and divisible at any point\u2014is sometimes read by\nNeoplatonist commentators and later sources interested in\nrapprochement with atomism as evidence that Aristotle\nendorsed the existence of minimal physical parts.\n\nIn late antiquity, this debate seems to have moved away from the\nradical solution of positing minimal physical parts or atoms\u2014a\nview that seems to have had few advocates\u2014into a puzzle about\nthe possibilities of \u2018bottom up\u2019 explanation versus the\nneed to regard emergent properties as \u2018supervening\u2019 and\nnot mere products of the necessary material base. The term\ntraditionally translated \u2018supervene\u2019\nhere\u2014epigignomai\u2014refers to the idea that forms\nare thought to come from a distinct source and inhere in suitable\nmaterial, rather than to be produced by the material substrate: it\ndoes not exactly correspond to the technical notion of supervenience\nformulated in late-20th century philosophy of mind. The reasons for\npositing minimal thresholds for the supervenience of form in John\nPhiloponus concern the inadequacy of material explanation because\nchanges in the matter do not correlate numerically to\u2014and hence\ncannot fully explain\u2014changes in qualities, and not because of\nconcerns about minimal parts (Berryman 2002).\n\nScholars have highlighted the importance of Islamic philosophers in\ndeveloping what came to be known in medieval Latin philosophy as the\ndoctrine of minima naturalia (Dijksterhuis 1961, 205; Glasner\n2001; McGinnis 2015). Giles of Rome particularly developed the notion\nof a natural minima in Thomistic thought: the notion of a minimum size\nfor a given substance was linked in these discussions to the problem\nthat a given quantity of one element could only be rarefied so far\nbefore it becomes a different element (Duhem 1985, 35\u201345).\n\nBook 4 of Aristotle\u2019s Meteorology was sometimes\nregarded as inauthentic in the past because of its use of explanations\nof the microstructure of matter, explanations that some scholars\nargued were too much of a concession in the direction of atomism to be\nAristotle\u2019s own. These arguments are no longer widely\naccepted.\n2.4 Diodorus Cronus\n\nDiodorus Cronus (late 4th c. BCE), a member of the supposed\nDialectical School, is reported to have offered new arguments that\nthere must be partless bodies or magnitudes. Most reports suggest that\nhis focus was on logical arguments rather than on physical theory: he\nused arguments that depend on positing mutually exhaustive\nalternatives.\n\nPerhaps drawing on an argument of Aristotle\u2019s (Sens. 7,\n449a20\u201331]), Diodorus apparently used the idea that there is a\nsmallest size at which an object at a given distance is visible as the\nbasis for an argument that there are indivisible magnitudes. His\nargument begins from the idea that there is a difference in size\nbetween the smallest size at which a given object is\nvisible\u2014presumably from a given distance\u2014and the largest\nsize at which it is invisible. Unless we concede that, at some\nmagnitude, a body is both invisible and visible (or neither), there\ncannot be any other magnitude intermediate between these two\nmagnitudes. Magnitudes must increase by discrete units.\n\nSextus Empiricus (AM 10.48ff) reports an argument of\nDiodorus\u2019 also concluding that magnitudes have discrete\nintervals. It also denies the existence of moving bodies, insisting\nthat bodies move neither when they are in the place where they are,\nnor when they are in the place where they are not. Since these\nalternatives are presented as exhaustive, the conclusion must be that\nbodies are never moving. However, rather than assert that everything\nis static, Diodorus took the view that bodies must have moved\nwithout ever being in motion: they are simply at one place at\none moment, and at another place at another moment.\n\nAs well as postulating the existence of indivisible smallest bodies\nand magnitudes, Diodorus seems to have supposed that there are\nindivisible smallest units of time. The argument about motion does not\nquite make it explicit that this is what he is committed to, but it is\na reasonable inference: given his insistence that bodies are always at\none place or another at any given time, he might well suppose that\ninfinite divisibility of time would open up the threatening\npossibility of indeterminacy as to whether the change of place has\ntaken place.\n\nFor those who posit indivisibles as a way to escape paradoxes about\ninfinite divisibility, parallel arguments might equally well have been\napplied to the problem of completing tasks in an infinitely divisible\ntime. Sextus Empiricus reports that the Aristotelian Strato of\nLampsacus (d. 268/70 BCE) argued for time atoms, although this is\ncontradicted by other sources. Sorabji (1983) suggests that Strato\nmerely countenanced the possibility that time could be\ndiscrete while space and motion are continuous, without endorsing this\nposition.\n2.5 Epicurean Atomism\n\nDemocritus\u2019 atomism was revived in the early Hellenistic period:\nEpicurus (341\u2013270 BCE) founded an atomist school in Athens about\n306 BCE. The Epicureans formed more of a closed community than other\nschools, and promoted a philosophy of a simple, pleasant life lived\nwith friends. The community included women, and some of its members\nraised children. The works of the founder were revered and some of\nthem were memorized, a practice that was thought to have discouraged\nphilosophical innovation by later members of the school, although this\nview has been challenged (Fish and Sanders 2011).\n\nEpicurus seems to have learned of atomist doctrine through\nDemocritus\u2019 follower Nausiphanes. Because Epicurus made some\nsignificant changes in atomist theory, it is often thought that his\nreformulation of the physical theory is an attempt to respond to\nAristotle\u2019s criticisms of Democritus. Even more significant,\nhowever, is the increasing centrality of ethical concerns to\nEpicurus\u2019 atomism, and the importance of the view that belief in\nan atomist physical theory helps us live better lives.\n\nEpicurus takes to heart a problem Democritus himself recognized, which\nis that atomist theory threatens to undermine itself if it removes any\ntrust we can place in the evidence of the senses, by claiming that\ncolors, etc. are unreal. He notoriously said that \u2018all\nperception is true,\u2019 apparently distinguishing between the\ncausal processes which impact our senses, all of which originate with\nthe films of atoms sloughed off by objects, and the judgments we make\non the basis of them, which may be false. Reasoning to truths about\nthings that are not apparent\u2014like the existence of\natoms\u2014depends on the evidence of the senses, which is always\ntrue in that it consists of impacts from actually existing films. For\nparticular phenomena, like meteorological events, Epicurus endorses\nthe existence of multiple valid explanations, acknowledging that we\nmay have no evidence for preferring one explanation over another.\n\nIt may be that Epicurus was less troubled by any such epistemological\nuncertainties because of his emphasis on the value of atomist theory\nfor teaching us how to live the untroubled and tranquil life. Denying\nany divine sanction for morality, and holding that the experience of\npleasure and pain are the source of all value, Epicurus thought we can\nlearn from atomist philosophy that pursuing natural and necessary\npleasures\u2014rather than the misleading desires inculcated by\nsociety\u2014will make pleasure readily attainable. At the same time,\nwe will avoid the pains brought on by pursuing unnatural and\nunnecessary pleasures. Understanding, on the basis of the atomist\ntheory, that our fears of the gods and of death are groundless will\nfree us from our chief mental pains.\n\nEpicurus made significant changes to atomist physical theory. It seems\nthat Democritus did not distinguish clearly between the physical\nuncuttability of atoms and their conceptual indivisibility: this\nraises a problem about how atoms can have parts, as evidenced by their\nvariations in shape or their ability to compose a magnitude, touching\none another in a series on different sides. Epicurus distinguished the\ntwo, holding that uncuttable atoms did have conceptually distinct\nparts, but that there was a lowest limit to these. Different solutions\nto this problem are found in ancient Indian atomism.\n\nEpicurus\u2019 view of the motion of atoms also differs from\nDemocritus\u2019. Rather than talking of a motion towards the center\nof a given cosmos, possibly created by the cosmic vortex, Epicurus\ngrants to atoms an innate tendency to downward motion through the\ninfinite cosmos. The downward direction is simply the original\ndirection of atomic fall. This may be in response to Aristotelian\ncriticisms that Democritus does not show why atomic motion exists,\nmerely saying that it is eternal and that it is perpetuated by\ncollisions. Moreover, although this is not attested in the surviving\nwritings of Epicurus, authoritative later sources attribute to him the\nidea that it belongs to the nature of atoms occasionally to exhibit a\nslight, otherwise uncaused swerve from their downward path. This is\nthought to explain why atoms have from infinite time entered into\ncollisions instead of falling in parallel paths: it is also said, by\nLucretius, to enter into the account of action and responsibility.\nScholars have proposed a number of alternative interpretations as to\nhow this is thought to work.\n\nThe epistemological concerns discussed above required a different view\non the nature of composites and macroscopic, perceptible properties.\nEpicurus rejected Democritus\u2019 eliminativist position that\nperceived properties only exist \u2018by convention\u2019 (Sedley\n1988; O\u2019Keefe 2005). Epicurus\u2019 successor Polystratus\nfurther defended and elaborated a claim about the reality of\nproperties, including relational properties. Moreover, with the\nrecovery of new papyrological evidence, controversy has arisen about\nthe extent to which Epicurus rejected Democritus\u2019 attempt to\naccount for all causal processes by the properties of the atoms and\nvoid alone. Although Epicurus\u2019 ideas have long been known from\nthree surviving letters preserved in the biography by Diogenes\nLaertius, no copy of his longer work On Nature had been\navailable. However, following excavation of the Epicurean library at\nHerculaneum that was buried by a volcanic eruption, some parts of this\nwork are being recovered. Many of the scrolls found are badly damaged,\nhowever, and interpretation of this newly recovered material is\nongoing.\n\nThe Herculaneum library contains much work of the Epicurean Philodemus\n(1st c. BCE). Philodemus wrote extensively, including on the history\nof philosophy, ethics, music, poetry, rhetoric and the emotions. He\nwrote a treatise on the theory of signs: because they are empiricists,\nbelieving that all knowledge comes from our sense experience, later\nEpicureans were concerned about the basis for our knowledge of\nimperceptibles like the atoms, and engaged in an extensive debate with\nthe Stoics about the grounds for inferences to imperceptible\nentities.\n\nAlthough Epicurus\u2019 doctrines teach the value of a quiet life in\na specially constructed Epicurean community and decry the search for\nfame, atomist theory is also regarded as a cure for the troubles\nafflicting others outside the community, and there are certainly\nEpicurean texts written for a wider audience. Besides the letters by\nEpicurus himself summarizing his doctrines, the Epicurean philosopher\nLucretius (d. c. 50 BCE) wrote a long Latin poem advocating\nEpicurus\u2019 ideas to Roman audiences (Sedley 1998). Lucretius\nmakes clear his close allegiance to Epicurus\u2019 own views, and\nprovides more detail on some topics than has survived from\nEpicurus\u2019 own work, such as an extended account of the origins\nof human society and institutions. A less sympathetic contemporary of\nLucretius, Cicero, also wrote a number of Latin works in which an\nEpicurean spokesman presents the doctrines of the school.\n\nDiogenes of Oenoanda propagated Epicurean doctrines in Asia Minor,\ninscribing them on the wall of a Stoa in his home town so as to\nconvert passersby to Epicurean theory. Excavation of these since the\nnineteenth century has also produced new texts. Smith (1993), in his\nlatest edition of the text of the inscriptions, dates them to the\nearly second century CE.\n2.6 Atomism and Particle Theories in Ancient Greek Sciences\n\nSome figures concerned with the natural sciences, especially medicine,\nare thought to have regarded organic bodies as composed of particles.\nGalen (2nd c. CE), in On the Natural Faculties, divides\nmedical theorists into two groups, following the division of natural\nphilosophers. On the one side are continuum theorists, who hold that\nall matter is infinitely divisible but that all the matter in things\nsubject to generation and corruption is susceptible to qualitative\nalteration. On the other are those who suppose that matter is composed\nof tiny, unchangeable particles separated by void spaces, and explain\nqualitative change as produced only in compound bodies, by\nrearrangement of the particles alone. In Galen\u2019s view,\nqualitative alteration is needed to produce the powers whereby\nbeneficent Nature directs change: Galen credits the first group with\nasserting the priority of Nature and its beneficent order, and the\nlatter with denying this.\n\nAlthough ancient Greek natural philosophers tend to fall on either\nside of Galen\u2019s divide (Furley 1987)\u2014continuum theory plus\nbeneficent teleology, vs. atomism plus blind necessity\u2014 there is\na danger in taking this dichotomy to be exhaustive or exclusive of\npossible natural philosophies. Inasmuch as the view Plato develops in\nTimaeus is atomistic and also endorses teleological\nexplanation, for example, his position complicates the picture, and\nother theories of natural philosophy in the Hellenistic period do not\ndivide so neatly onto one side or the other. Comparison to other\ntraditions makes clear that atomism has no necessary affinity to the\nabsence of divine organization. Galen has polemical interests in\ndiscrediting those who deny the need for qualitatively irreducible\nfaculties or powers employed by Nature to produce beneficial\nresults.\n\nA prevailing tendency in modern scholarship to identify particle\ntheories with \u2018mechanistic\u2019 thinking is not representative\nof ancient atomism: the identification of Greek atomism as a precursor\nto the New Science was due to the work of 17th century figures like\nPierre Gassendi, Henry More and Robert Boyle. Galen elsewhere\nexplicitly contrasts atomist thought with the schools who appeal to\nexplanations from mechanics (Berryman 2002). Galen\u2019s\npresentation of Greek natural philosophy was important in the later\nreception of ideas into Islamic philosophy (Langermann 2009) and the\nRenaissance (Copenhaver 1998).\n\nThe theories of Heracleides of Pontus (4th c. BCE) and Asclepiades of\nBythnia (2nd c. BCE) are sometimes likened to atomism (Gottschalk\n1980; Vallance 1990). Both\u2014a pupil of Plato, and a medical\ntheorist\u2014are said to have posited the existence of corpuscles\nthey call anarmoi onkoi, likely some kind of partless masses:\nthe precise meaning is uncertain. Although the theories of Asclepiades\nin particular are often assimilated to atomism, it may be that\nGalen\u2019s characterization of this view is polemical, and that\nAsclepiades\u2019 particles are capable of division. Galen is the\nsource for a distinctive argument against the idea that atoms were\nalike in substance, based on the Hippocratic idea that organisms\ncomposed of a single substance would not be able to experience\nsensations like pain (Leith 2014). Ironically, Galen\u2019s theory of\nthe four elements was sometimes interpreted as an atomist theory by\nmedieval sources (Langermann 2009).\n\nOne of the most prominent writers on mechanics in antiquity, Hero of\nAlexandria (1st c. CE), is sometimes regarded, following Hermann\nDiels, as an atomist in the Democritean tradition. In the introduction\nto his Pneumatica, Hero describes matter as made up of\nparticles with spaces between them. However, Hero\u2019s account of\npneumatic effects involving compression of air seems to depend on the\ndeformation of elastic particles which can be compressed artificially\nbut will spring back to their original shape quite vehemently. If so,\nhis account denies a fundamental tenet of classical atomism, that\natoms do not change in their intrinsic properties like shape (Berryman\n2011). Pneumatics, because its effects were thought to depend on\nforces acting against a void, provided stimulus to discussions of the\npossibility of void and why its supposed impossibility would cause\nwater to move against its natural direction. In late antiquity, John\nPhiloponus theorized that void must be at least theoretically possible\nfor these effects to occur (Sedley 1987).\n3. The Legacy of Ancient Atomism\n\nThe conventional division into \u2018ancient and modern\u2019 was\ndeveloped in a European context that does not necessarily reflect the\nhistory of other cultures. Without intending to overstate the value or\ngenerality of this division, we might regard three major bodies of\nthought as inheriting ideas from the \u2018ancient\u2019 traditions\ndiscussed above: atomism in Islamic kal\u0101m thought; the\nrevival of atomism in the European Renaissance and after; and the\ncontinued interest in atomist theories in Indian philosophy through\nthe early modern period.\n3.1 Atomism in the Islamic World\n\nBeginning in the late 8th century CE/2nd century AH),\ndifferent versions of atomism were adopted and developed by many\nadherents of the Islamic schools of kal\u0101m or theology.\nThe most important of these early atomist schools were located in\nBasra and Baghdad. The philosopher-physician Ab\u016b Bakr\nal-R\u0101z\u012b (d. 313/925) also developed an atomist theory (Pines\n1997; Baffioni 1982; Adamson 2014; Koetschet 2019), although adherents\nof the philosophical schools known as falsafa more commonly\nadhered to a philosophical picture based on Neoplatonic continuum\nmetaphysics. Some medieval Jewish philosophers of the Karaite school,\nwriting in Arabic and influenced by kal\u0101m thought,\nadopted atomist views (Ben-Shammai, 1985). Critics of\nkal\u0101m atomism include Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, the\n11th/5th century philosopher known as Avicenna\nin the West, and Maimonides (12th/6th C) in his Guide for the\nPerplexed. Fakhr al-d\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b responded to Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s criticisms in the 12th/6th century (Dhanani\n2015), and atomist ideas were publicized by the work of al-Ij\u012b\n(d. 1355 CE) and his student al-Taftazani, which present arguments\nfrom earlier kalam and falsafa natural philosophy\nand were used for teaching purposes (Dhanani 2017).\n\nAlthough the loss of texts makes it difficult to trace the origins of\natomism in Islamic thought, scholars argue that ancient Greek theories\nmay have reached the Mutakallimun by oral transmission if not\nby translation of texts; the indirect transmission may explain some\ndivergences (Wolfson 1976; Dhanani 1994). Epicurean rather than\nDemocritean ideas may have been transmitted through doxographies (van\nEss 2018) or from Galen\u2019s critiques (Langermann 2009); other\npossible routes of transmission that have been explored include the\nGreek sceptical tradition and the supposed atomism of the Pythagorean\nEcphantus (Baffioni 1982). Attempts have also been made to link\nkal\u0101m atomism to the Indian tradition (Pines 1997;\nWolfson 1976): echoes include a similar argument that a mountain and a\nmustard seed would be equal if bodies were infinitely divisible, and\nthe fact that perceptible properties are ascribed to atoms, in\ncontrast to the Greek tradition. Whatever its antecedents, the\ndevelopment of atomism in an Islamic context\u2014where different\nphilosophical questions prevailed\u2014led to creative innovations\nand a distinctive critical tradition of atomist thought (Rashed\n2005).\n\nUnlike Greek atomists, Abu al-Hudhayl\u2014regarded as the founder of\nkal\u0101m atomism\u2014posited that atoms were\nindiscernible from one another even in size or shape. Rashed (2005)\nargues for the distinctness of al-Hudhayl\u2019s atoms from both\nancient Greek or Indian antecedents, since atoms were conceived as\nEuclidean points and not as extended material bodies. Rashed stresses\nthe importance of the conception of atoms as in motion at an\ninstant, connecting it to the development of a notion that bodies\noccupying infinitesimal locations could possess motion as a dynamic\nproperty, and to a treatment of mathematical properties that were not\nmerely regarded as abstracted from bodies, as in the Aristotelian\ntradition (Rashed 2005). Al-Nazz\u0101n, a prominent early critic of\natomism, tried to solve paradoxes about motion over infinitely\ndivisible continua with the alternative thesis that motion consisted\nin an imperceptible \u2018leap\u2019 from one location to\nanother.\n\nBecause any Islamic metaphysical system was committed to a Creator\nGod, the ancient Greek use of atomism to solve the problem of change\nwithout something coming from nothing could not be the motivation for\nkal\u0101m atomism. Some scholars believe the created nature\nof atoms could have been used as an argument for the existence of God,\nsince creation implies a Creator (Adamson 2016, 16). Atoms could not\ncontinue existing on their own but were continually recreated by God\nat every instant. Al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s atomism, by contrast,\ndenied that creation from nothing was possible and supposed that atoms\nwere eternal (Pines 1997, 48). Baffioni (1982) contrasts\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s physical motivations for adopting atomism\nwith the \u2018teleological\u2019 atomism of the kal\u0101m\nschools.\n\nCentral debates about the viability of atomism in the Islamic world\ncentred on infinite divisibility, applying paradoxes similar to those\nof Zeno to the problem of an ant crawling over a sandal. A problem\nabout the fact that different particles in a rolling millstone or\nwheel must be moving at different speeds, despite the apparent\ncohesiveness of the millstone, is found in Islamic discussions. The\ninsistence within kal\u0101m atomism on recognizing accidents\nthat adhere in the whole of composite bodies, and that cannot be\ntraced back to the properties of individual atoms, may share the\nmotivation of Epicurus\u2019 attempt to avoid the eliminativism of\nDemocritus\u2019 theory. Likewise, epistemological arguments for\npreserving confidence in sense perception, even given the possibility\nof illusion, may have been formulated to avoid the sceptical potential\ninherent in a Democritean approach to perception and empirical\nknowledge.\n\nAtoms in Islamic philosophy were typically defined by the occupation\nof space and the exclusion of other bodies; by their ability to\nreceive accidents; and by their ability to be perceived by the senses\nof sight and touch, presumably in sufficiently large aggregates. The\nassertion of an entailment between materiality and occupying space was\napparently directed against the Peripatetic notion of matter and the\nAristotelian notion of natural place (Dhanani 1994, 88\u201389). The\nspatial extendedness of atoms was also linked to the notion that atoms\nserved as a unit for measuring extension. Because spherical atoms\npacked together would leave a space that is smaller than the\natom\u2014which would be impossible if atoms represented the smallest\npossible magnitude\u2014atoms were said to be cubic (Dhanani 1994,\n115). Atoms were thought to adhere to one another without the physical\n\u2018hooks\u2019 proposed by Democritus; even so, it proved\ndifficult to avoid ascribing subatomic parts to atoms.\n\nAs in the Greek tradition, the positing of atoms in Islamic thought\nwas paired with assertions about the existence of void space, in\nopposition to the continuum physics characteristic of most\nfalsafa thought (cf. Pines 1979). Debate over the existence\nof void was enriched by the need to explain the operation of so-called\npneumatic devices like the siphon, medical cupping glasses or syringe\n(Lugal and Sayili 1951; Koetschet 2019). The supposed impossibility of\nvoid space forming was used to account for observed fluid movements in\npneumatic devices, raising questions about how a metaphysical\nimpossibility might produce physical motions. Ingenious thought\nexperiments were developed to test the assumptions at work, asking\nwhat would happen if a single film of atoms were trapped between two\ncupping glasses, or comparing the effect of cupping glasses on stone\nto their effect on flesh (Dhanani 1994, 77). The fascination with\npneumatic technology in the medieval Islamic world is attested in\nsurviving texts which detail increasingly complex marvels: trick\nfountains, surprise vessels, water clocks with elaborate mechanical\nside-shows (Hill 1974, 1979), although the explanation of these\neffects did not necessarily involve atomist or particle theories of\nmatter. \n3.2 Ancient Greek Atomism in Later European Philosophy\n\nAristotelian natural philosophy came to predominate in the medieval\nLatin West during the 13th century, and prevailed in the universities\ninto the seventeenth century. Nonetheless, scholars recognize pockets\nof interest in atomist thought in the middle ages, including a 12th\ncentury \u2018renaissance\u2019 of atomism (Pabst 1991, 1994; Grant\n1996; Dijksterhuis 1961), and the work of the 14th century\n\u2018indivisibilists,\u2019 who focused on the mathematics of\nmotion (Duhem 1985; Murdoch 1982, 1984). Reasons for the renewed\ninterest in atomist thought have been linked to the vision of a\nrelatively autonomous nature found in Timaeus (Pabst 1994),\nand to the need to account for motion of immaterial bodies like angels\n(Murdoch 1984). Medical authors and Latin sources were important in\nthe transmission of ideas from antiquity to the 12th century, for whom\nthe atomist theories in the Arabic tradition were largely inaccessible\n(Pabst 1994, 86). Later medieval Latin philosophers would have access\nto ideas from the Islamic atomist tradition through Maimonides\u2019\nreports and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s refutations: modern scholarly\nopinions differ as to the extent to which Latin theorists were aware\nof Islamic atomism, however: recent scholarship has uncovered more\nevidence of borrowings from the Islamic world into the 14th century\nLatin texts (Murdoch 1974; Sorabji 1982; Freudenthal 2003; Grellard\n2009; Robert 2009).\n\nAlthough 12th century atomists were inspired by Plato,\nCalcidius\u2019 widely circulated commentary did not include the\npassages detailing Plato\u2019s geometrical atomism: instead, they\ndeveloped particle theories and attempted to reconcile these with the\ndoctrine of the four elements. An original attempt by Thierry of\nChartes to solve the problem of the different motions of the four\nelements\u2014fire and air tending upward, earth and water tending\ndownward to different degrees\u2014relied on the relative\ncohesiveness of different elements to explain the different degrees of\nmobility (Pabst 1991). Elemental intertransformation shows that\nelements must be composed of atoms of similar substance, but fire\natoms, say, are less entangled with one another and thus more mobile\nthan other kinds of atoms. Other classic problems, including puzzles\nabout the different speeds of particles of a rotating wheel, continued\nto occupy theorists into the early modern period; this problem was\ncalled rota Aristotelis or \u2018Aristotle\u2019s\nwheel\u2019 because of its appearance in the pseudo-Aristotelian\nMechanica (Palmerino 2001).\n\nRenaissance alchemy, as much as the reworking of ancient Greek atomist\ntheories by adherents of the \u2018New Science\u2019 of the\nseventeenth century, proved important sources of inspiration for\ncorpuscularian theories in the early modern world (Newman 2006). The\nAristotelian notion of minima naturalia, and the appeal to\nmicrostructures of matter in explanation of chemical changes in\nAristotle\u2019s Meteorology IV, meant that consideration of\ncorpuscularian explanations need not automatically be framed as a\nrejection of Aristotle. A useful corrective here to the tendency to\nregard early modern atomism as merely reviving ancient Greek theories\nis Newman\u2019s argument that an \u2018operational\u2019 notion of\nminima\u2014the smallest unit that seems to be manifest in the best\nexplanation of the observed phenomena\u2014emerged from the\nalchemical tradition and provided an alternative to the metaphysical\narguments of the ancient Greek atomists (Newman 2006, 2009).\n\nHero of Alexandria\u2019s matter theory has long been considered an\nimportant source for Robert Boyle and other New Scientists of the\nseventeenth century (Boas 1949). However, Hero\u2019s theory differed\nfrom classical atomism, and drew heavily on the need to explain\npneumatic effects (see section 2.6 above). The evidence of\nSennert\u2019s influence on Boyle casts further doubts on the\ncentrality of ancient Greek atomism to his matter theory. Newman\n(2006, 2009) argues that the relevant sense of \u2018atom\u2019\ndepended on the incapacity for chemical decomposition, not spatial or\nphysical indivisibility, a notion grounded in empirical evidence\nrather than logical or mathematical reasoning.\n\nMilton (2002) offers a helpful perspective on why ancient Greek\natomism, despite its naturalist worldview, was not especially\nconducive to scientific investigation. Features of seventeenth century\nNew Science that do not fit well with classical atomist theory include\nthe application of mathematical analysis to motion and the appeal to a\nmachine model to conceptualize the possibility that complex causal\nsequencing could produce regular and determinate results without\nongoing intelligent direction (Berryman 2009). A modern scholarly\ntendency to describe Democritean atomism as \u2018mechanistic\u2019\ncontributes to a prevailing overestimate of the scientific credentials\nof ancient Greek atomism.\n\nEpicurean philosophy played a very different role in the seventeenth\nand eighteenth centuries, providing a classical \u2018cover\u2019\nfor hedonistic and anti-religious sentiment among intellectuals\nattracted by the vision of a tranquil life free of fear of the gods\n(Kargon 1966; Wilson 2008). Women philosophers and intellectuals were\nunusually prominent amongst the seventeenth century advocates and\ntranslators of Epicurus (Wilson 2008). The Cambridge Platonists may\nhave fueled the identification of atomism with atheism, because of the\npresentation of ancient Greek natural philosophy in Cudworth\u2019s\nTrue Intellectual System of the Universe. A tendency to\nmischaracterize Epicurean philosophy as licentious persisted.\n\nThe young Karl Marx wrote his doctoral dissertation on Democritus, a\nfact that may have contributed to his sensitivity to materialist\nexplanations. Given the association with Marx, Soviet-era scholarship\nproduced important work on Democritus, especially S.I. Luria\u2019s\nmagisterial edition of the fragments.\n3.3 Early Modern Indian Atomism\n\nThe philosophical traditions discussed above continued for over a\nmillenium in the Indian schools, without the historical discontinuity\ncaused in Europe and West Asia by the collapse of the Roman Empire and\nthe rise of Islam. The debate between \u2018idealist\u2019 and\n\u2018realist\u2019 metaphysics continued, the latter represented by\nthe Navya-Ny\u0101ya school which developed about the fourteenth\ncentury, building on the work of Udayana and G\u00e1nge\u1e63a\n(Phillips 1995). Stephen Phillips argues that the \u2018New\nLogic\u2019 thought of Navya-Ny\u0101ya school proliferated in Indian\nculture and law as well as impacting other philosophical schools,\nespecially after 1500 CE. Although it incorporated\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika realism, the focus was on epistemology and on\ncognitive experience rather than on the atomist metaphysics.\n\nJonardon Ganeri (2011) has argued for regarding the early modern\nperiod in India as a period of innovation comparable to that in\nEurope, although the Indian intellectual world was less concerned to\npresent itself as a radical break from the past than was true of the\nEuropean \u2018New Science.\u2019 Fran\u00e7ois Bernier, protege\nof the French atomist Pierre Gassendi, travelled to India in 1656 and\nfound a receptive audience in the Sanskrit scholars trained in the\natomism of the classical period of Indian philosophy (Ganeri 2011).\nJayar\u0101ma, an early modern Indian atomist working in the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika tradition, produced an atomist theory that Ganeri\nargues is closer to that of Daniel Sennert than to that of Gassendi\n(Ganeri 2011, p. 218). Substantial concessions are made within this\natomist metaphysics towards acknowledging the reality of emergent\nproperties.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["General", "Atomism in Classical Indian Philosophy", "Leucippus and Democritus", "Plato, Platonists and Pythagoreans", "Minima Naturalia in Aristotelian Thought", "Diodorus Cronus", "Epicurean Atomism", "Atomism and Particle Theories in Ancient Greek Sciences", "Atomism in the Islamic World", "Ancient Greek Atomism in Later European Philosophy", "Early Modern Indian Atomism"], "cat_ref_text": {"General": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Dijksterhuis, E.J., 1961. <em>The Mechanization of the World\nPicture</em>, trans.
