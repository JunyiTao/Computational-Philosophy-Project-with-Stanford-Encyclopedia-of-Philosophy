    "main_text": "The Arguments for the Principles of Justice from the Original Position || The Strains of Commitment\n6.4 Stability, Publicity, and Self-Respect\n\nRawls\u2019s strains-of-commitment argument explicitly relies upon a\nrarely noted feature of his argument: as mentioned earlier, there are\nin effect two social contracts. First, hypothetical agents\nsituated equally in the original position unanimously agree to\nprinciples of justice. This agreement has attracted the most attention\nfrom Rawls\u2019s critics. But the parties\u2019 hypothetical\nagreement in the original position is patterned on the general\nacceptability of a conception of justice by free and equal persons in\na well-ordered society. Rawls says, \u201cThe reason for invoking the\nconcept of a contract in the original position lies in its\ncorrespondence with the features of a well-ordered society [which]\nrequire\u2026that everyone accepts, and knows that the others\naccept, the same principles of justice\u201d (CP 250). In order for\nthe hypothetical parties in the original position to agree on\nprinciples of justice, there must be a high likelihood that real\npersons, given human nature and general facts about social and\neconomic cooperation, can also agree and act on the same principles,\nand that a society structured by these principles is feasible and can\nendure. This is the stability requirement referred to\nearlier. One conception of justice is relatively more stable than\nanother the more willing people are to observe its requirements under\nconditions of a well-ordered society. Assuming that each conception of\njustice has a corresponding society that is as well-ordered as can be\naccording to its terms, the stability question raised in\nTheory is: Which conception of justice is more likely to\nengage the moral sensibilities and sense of justice of free and equal\npersons as well as affirm their good? This requires an inquiry into\nmoral psychology and the human good, which takes up most of Part III\nof A Theory of Justice.\n\nRawls makes two arguments in Theory from the original\nposition that invoke the stability requirement, the arguments (1) from\npublicity and (2) from self-respect (see TJ, \u00a729)\n\n(1) The argument from publicity: Rawls contends that utilitarianism,\nperfectionism, and other \u201cteleological\u201d conceptions are\nunlikely to be freely acceptable to many citizens when made fully\npublic under the conditions of a well-ordered society. Recall the\npublicity condition discussed earlier: A feature of a\nwell-ordered society is that its regulative principles of justice are\npublicly known and appealed to as a basis for deciding laws and\njustifying basic institutions. Because all reasonable members of\nsociety accept the public conception of justice, there is no need for\nthe illusions and delusions of ideology for a society to function\nproperly and citizens to accept its laws and institutions willingly.\nIn this sense a well-ordered society lacks false consciousness about\nthe bases of social and political relations. (PL 68\u201369n.) A\nconception of justice that satisfies the publicity condition but that\ncannot maintain the stability of a well-ordered society is to be\nrejected by the parties in the original position. Rawls contends that\nunder the publicity condition justice as fairness generally engages\ncitizens\u2019 sense of justice and remains more stable than\nutilitarianism (TJ 177f./154f.rev.) For public knowledge that reasons\nof maximum average (or aggregate) utility determine the distribution\nof benefits and burdens would lead those worse-off to object to and\nresent their situation, and reject the principle of utility as the\nbasic principle governing social institutions. After all, the\nwell-being and interests of the least advantaged, perhaps even their\nbasic liberties, are being sacrificed for the greater happiness of\nthose who are already more fortunate and have a greater share of\nprimary social goods. It is too much to expect of human nature that\npeople should freely acquiesce in and embrace such publicly known\nterms of cooperation. By contrast, the principles of justice are\ndesigned to advance reciprocally everyone\u2019s position; those who\nare better off do not achieve their gains at the expense of the less\nadvantaged. \u201cSince everyone\u2019s good is affirmed, all\nacquire inclinations to uphold the scheme\u201d (TJ, 177/155). It is\na feature of our moral psychology, Rawls contends, that we normally\ncome to form attachments to people and institutions that are concerned\nwith our good; moreover we tend to resent those persons and\ninstitutions that take unfair advantage of us and act contrary to our\ngood. Rawls argues at length in chapter 8 of Theory,\n\u00a7\u00a770\u201375, that justice as fairness accords better than\nalternative principles with the reciprocity principles of moral\npsychology that are characteristic of human beings\u2019 moral\ndevelopment.\n\nIn Political Liberalism, Rawls expands the publicity\ncondition to include three levels: First, the principles of justice\ngoverning a well-ordered society are publicly known and appealed to in\npolitical debate and deliberation; second, so too are the general\nbeliefs in light of which society\u2019s conception of justice is\ngenerally accepted\u2014including beliefs about human nature and the\nway political and social institutions generally work\u2014and\ncitizens generally agree on these beliefs that support society\u2019s\nonception of justice. Finally the full justification of the public\nconception of justice is also publicly known (or at least publicly\navailable to any who are interested) and is reflected in\nsociety\u2019s system of law, judicial decisions and other political\ninstitutions, as well as its system of education.\n\n(2) The argument from the social bases of self-respect: The\npublicity condition is also crucial to Rawls\u2019s fourth argument\nfor the principles of justice, from the social bases of self-respect\n(TJ, 178\u201382/155\u201359 rev.). These principles, when publicly\nknown, give greater support to citizens\u2019 sense of\nself-respect than do utilitarian and perfectionist principles.\nRawls says self-respect is \u201cperhaps the most important primary\ngood,\u201d (TJ, 440/386 rev.) since few things seem worth doing if a\nperson has little sense of their own worth or no confidence in their\nabilities to execute a worthwhile life plan or fulfill the duties and\nexpectations in their role as citizens. The parties in the original\nposition will then aim to choose principles that best secure their\nsense of self-respect. Now being regarded by others as a free and\nindependent person of equal status with others is crucial to the\nself-respect of persons who regard themselves as free and equal\nmembers of a democratic society. Justice as fairness, by affording and\nprotecting the priority of equal basic liberties and fair equal\nopportunities for all, secures the status of each as free and equal\ncitizens. For example, because of equal political liberties, there are\nno \u201cpassive citizens\u201d who must depend on others to\npolitically protect their rights and interests; and with fair equal\nopportunities no one has grounds to experience the resentment that\ninevitably arises in societies where social positions are effectively\nclosed off to those less advantaged or less powerful. Moreover, the\nsecond principle secures adequate social powers and economic resources\nfor all so that they find the effective exercise of their equal basic\nliberties to be worthwhile. The second principle has the effect of\nmaking citizens socially and economically independent, so that no one\nneed be subservient to the will of another. Citizens then can regard\nand respect one another as equals, and not as masters or subordinates.\n(\u201cNon-domination,\u201d an idea central to contemporary\nRepublicanism, is then essential to citizens\u2019 sense of\nself-respect in Rawls\u2019s sense. See Pettit 1997.) Equal basic\nliberties, fair equal opportunities, and political and economic\nindependence are primary among the social bases of self-respect in a\ndemocratic society. The parties in the original position should then\nchoose the principles of justice over utilitarianism and other\nteleological views both to secure their sense of self-respect, and to\nprocure the same for others, thereby guaranteeing greater overall\nstability. In connection with Rawls\u2019s argument for the\ngreater stability of principles of justice on grounds of their\npublicity and the bases of self-respect, Rawls provides a Kantian\ninterpretation of difference principle. He says: \u201c[T]he\ndifference principle interprets the distinction between treating men\nas means only and treating them as ends in themselves. To regard\npersons as ends in themselves in the basic design of society is to\nagree to forgo those gains that do not contribute to everyone\u2019s\nexpectations. By contrast to regard persons as means is to be prepared\nto impose on those already less favored still lower prospects of life\nfor the sake of the higher expectations of others\u201d (TJ 157\nrev.). Rawls says the principle of utility does just this; it treats\nthe less fortunate as means since it requires them to accept even\nlower life prospects for the sake of others who are more fortunate and\nalready better off. This exhibits a lack of respect for the less\nadvantaged and in turn has the effect of undermining their sense of\nself respect. (TJ 158 rev.) The difference principle, by contrast,\ndoes not treat people as means or undermine their sense of self\nrespect, and this adds to the reasons the parties have for choosing\nthe principles of justice instead of the principle of utility.\n\n\nRawls substantially relies on the publicity condition to argue against\nutilitarianism and perfectionism. He says publicity \u201carises\nnaturally from a contractarian standpoint\u201d (TJ, 133/115 rev.).\nIn Theory he puts great weight on publicity ultimately\nbecause he thinks that giving people knowledge of the moral bases of\ncoercive laws and the principles governing society is a condition of\nfully acknowledging and respecting them as free and responsible\nrational moral agents. With publicity of principles of justice, people\nhave knowledge of the real reasons for their social and political\nrelations and the formative influences of the basic structure on their\ncharacters, plans and prospects. In a well-ordered society with a\npublic conception of justice, there is no need for an \u201cesoteric\nmorality\u201d that must be confined \u201cto an enlightened\nfew\u201d (as Sidgwick says of utilitarianism, Sidgwick 1907 [1981],\n490). Moreover, public principles of justice can serve agents in their\npractical reasoning and provide democratic citizens a common basis for\npolitical argument and justification. These considerations underlie\nRawls\u2019s later contention that having knowledge of the principles\nthat determine the bases of social relations is a precondition of\nindividuals\u2019 freedom.(CP 325f.) Rawls means in part that\npublicity of society\u2019s fundamental principles is a condition of\ncitizens\u2019 exercise of the powers and abilities that enable them\nto take full responsibility for their lives. Full publicity is then a\ncondition of the political and (in TJ) moral autonomy of\npersons, which are significant values according to justice as\nfairness. (TJ \u00a778, PL 68, CP 325\u201326)\n\nUtilitarians often regard Rawls\u2019s emphasis on the publicity of\nthe fundamental principles underlying social cooperation as\nunwarranted. They contend that publicity of laws is of course\nimportant for them to be effective, but there\u2019s no practical\nneed for the publicity of the fundamental principles (such as the\nprinciples of efficiency and utility) that govern political decisions,\nthe economy, and society, much less so for the publicity of the full\njustification of these principles. Most people are not interested and\nhave little understanding of the complex often technical details that\nmust go into deciding laws and social policies. Moreover, as Sidgwick\nclaimed, utilitarianism functions better as an \u201cesoteric\nmorality\u201d that is not generally incorporated into the public\njustification of laws and institutions. Others claim that\nRawls\u2019s arguments from publicity are exaggerated. If people were\nproperly educated to believe that promoting greater overall happiness\nor welfare is the ultimate requirement of justice and more generally\nof morality, then just as they have for centuries constrained their\nconduct and their self-interests and accepted political constraints on\ntheir own liberties for the sake of their religious beliefs, so too\ncould they be educated to accept the promotion of social utility and\nthe general welfare as the fundamental bases for social and political\ncooperation.\nSupplementary Documents on Other Topics\n\nAdditional topics concerining the original position are discussed\nin the following supplementary documents:\n\nThe Argument for the Difference Principle. \nExplains the Difference Principle and the least advantaged class.\nComparison of the difference principle with mixed conceptions,\nincluding restricted utility.
