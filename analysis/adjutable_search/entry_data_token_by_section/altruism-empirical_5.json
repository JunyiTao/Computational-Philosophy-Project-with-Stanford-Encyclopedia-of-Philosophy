    "main_text": "The Egoism vs. Altruism Debate in Psychology || The Social Punishment Hypothesis\n5.1 The Social Punishment Hypothesis\n\nOne of the more popular egoist alternatives to the empathy-altruism\nhypothesis is the idea that people engage in helping behavior because\nthey fear that other people will punish them if they do not. If I\ndon\u2019t help, the actor is supposed to worry, people will be angry\nor they will think badly of me, and this may have negative effects on\nhow they treat me in the future. As it stands, this egoist hypothesis\ncan\u2019t explain the fact that empathy increases the likelihood of\nhelping, but a more sophisticated version is easy to construct by\nadding the assumption that people think social sanctions for not\nhelping are more likely when the target engenders empathy.\n\nTo test this hypothesis\u2014which Batson calls the socially\nadministered empathy-specific punishment hypothesis\u2014against\nthe empathy-altruism hypothesis, Batson and his associates (Fultz et\nal. 1986) designed an experiment in which they manipulated both the\nlevel of empathy that subjects felt for the target and the likelihood\nthat anyone would know whether or not the subject had opted to help a\nperson in need. Others can form a negative evaluation of your decision\nnot to help only if they know the choice you are facing and\nthe decision you have made; if your decision is secret, you need have\nno fear of social sanctions. Thus the socially administered\nempathy-specific punishment hypothesis predicts that subjects who\nexhibit high empathy on a given occasion will be more likely to help\nwhen they believe others will know if they fail to do so. On the\nempathy-altruism hypothesis, by contrast, high empathy subjects are\nmotivated by an ultimate desire to help, and thus their helping levels\nshould be high whether or not others would know if they decided not to\nhelp. In the low empathy condition, both hypotheses predict that\nlevels of helping will be low. These predictions are summarized in\nTables 1 and 2. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential for Negative\nSocial Evaluation\nEmpathy\n\nLow\nHigh\n\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\n\nLow\nLow\nLow\n\n \n\n\u2190\nLevel of Empathy\n\n\u2190\nLevel of Helping\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Predictions About the Amount of\nHelping (Low or High) on the Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis.\n\n\nSubjects in the experiment were told that they were participating in\nan impression formation study, and that they had been randomly\nassigned to the role of \u201clistener\u201d in which they would\nread confidential notes from another student participant, the\n\u201ccommunicator\u201d. They were given two notes from Janet\nArnold, an out-of-state freshman who reveals that she is very lonely\nand hoping to find a friend. After completing a form on which subjects\nindicated their impressions of Janet and their emotional responses to\nher note, they were presented with an unexpected opportunity to\nbefriend Janet by volunteering to take part in a study of long-term\nrelationships involving an initial meeting with Janet and periodic\nphone interviews about the development of their friendship.\nParticipants who were willing to help were asked how much time they\nwere willing to spend with Janet during the next month.\n\nTo manipulate empathy, Batson and his associates used the Stotland\ntechnique. Subjects assigned to the low-empathy condition were\ninstructed to \n\n\nRead the information in the communicator\u2019s notes carefully,\ntrying to be as objective as possible. Try to focus on the techniques\nused to get the communicator\u2019s message across. \n\n\nSubjects assigned to the high-empathy condition were instructed to\n\n\n\nRead the information in the communicator\u2019s notes carefully,\ntrying to take the perspective of the individual writing the notes.\nTry to imagine how this individual feels about what he or she writes.\n(1991: 132)\n\n\nFour steps were taken to manipulate the perceived potential for\nnegative social evaluation. In the low-potential condition\n(1991: 132):\n\nSubjects were told that they would be the only person ever to read\nthe communicator\u2019s notes, and the notes were delivered in a\nsealed envelope.\nSubjects were assured that the questionnaires reporting their\nreactions to Janet\u2019s note would be anonymous.\nSubjects\u2019 responses to the invitation to participate in the\nlong-term relationship study were returned to the professor in a\nsealed envelope, so no one would know if they did not want to help\nJanet. (Since they believed the professor had not read Janet\u2019s\nnote, they could be expected to surmise that he would not know that\nJanet needed a friend.)\nIn the letter inviting them to participate in the relationship\nstudy, subjects were told that Janet would be contacted \u201conly if\nyou want a meeting; if you do not, then we will not contact the\ncommunicator and he or she will not know that you were ever asked\nabout actually meeting\u201d.\n\n\nIn the high-potential condition (1991: 133):\n\nSubjects were told that the experimenter would read the\ncommunicator\u2019s notes. Also, the experimenter would collect the\nquestionnaire when the subject completed it and would compare the\ncontent of the notes with the impressions the subject formed.\nNo envelope was provided for their response to the invitation to\nparticipate in the long-term relationship study, so subjects could\ninfer that the experimenter would know about Janet\u2019s need for a\nfriend, about their emotional reaction to Janet, and would also know\nwhether or not they had agreed to help Janet.\nSubjects were told that Janet would know if they decided not to\nhelp.\n\n\nAs Batson notes, procedures in the high-potential condition \n\n\nwere designed to highlight the possibility of negative social\nevaluation if the participant decided not to volunteer to spend time\nwith Janet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential for Negative\nSocial Evaluation\nEmpathy\n\nLow\nHigh \n\nHigh\n0.67\n1.71\n\nLow\n1.29\n2.44\n \n \n\n\u2190\nLevel of Empathy\n\n\u2190\nLevel of Helping\n\n\n\nTable 3. Amount of Help Offered Janet,\ngiven as the mean amount of time participants offered to spend with\nJanet (Fultz et al. 1986, Study 2)\n\n\nThe results, given in Table 3, indicate that the socially administered\nempathy-specific punishment hypothesis did not fare well. On the basis\nof this experiment and a similar experiment in which empathy for Janet\nwas not manipulated but was measured by self-report, Batson concludes\nthat the socially administered empathy-specific punishment hypothesis\nis not consistent with the experimental facts.\n\n\nContrary to what the social-evaluation version of the empathy-specific\npunishment hypothesis predicted, eliminating anticipated negative\nsocial evaluation in these two studies did not eliminate the\nempathy-helping relationship. Rather than high empathy leading to more\nhelp only under high social evaluation, it led to more helping under\nboth low and high social evaluation. This pattern of results is not\nconsistent with what would be expected if empathically aroused\nindividuals are egoistically motivated to avoid looking bad in the\neyes of others; it is quite consistent with what would be expected if\nempathy evokes altruistic motivation to reduce the victim\u2019s need\n(Batson 1991: 134).\n\n\nThough two experiments hardly make a conclusive case, these studies\nmake the socially administered empathy-specific punishment hypothesis\nlook significantly less plausible than the empathy-altruism\nhypothesis. So one popular egoist hypothesis has been dealt a serious\nblow: high empathy subjects were more likely to help whether or\nnot they could expect their behavior to be socially\nscrutinized. At least in some circumstances, empathy appears to\nfacilitate helping independently of the threat of social sanction.\n",
