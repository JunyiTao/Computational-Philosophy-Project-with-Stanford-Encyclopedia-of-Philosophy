    "main_text": "\n\nKarl Jaspers (1883\u20131969) began his academic career working as a\npsychiatrist and, after a period of transition, he converted to\nphilosophy in the early 1920s. Throughout the middle decades of the\ntwentieth century he exercised considerable influence on a number of\nareas of philosophical inquiry: especially on epistemology, the\nphilosophy of religion, and political theory.\n\nThe influence of Kant over Jaspers is widely acknowledged in the\nliterature, to the extent that he has been depicted as \u201cThe\nfirst and the last Kantian\u201d (Heinrich Barth, quoted in Ehrlich\n1975, 211). Usually this evaluation is based on his reliance on the\nsubjective-experiential transformation of Kantian philosophy, which\nreconstructs Kantian transcendentalism as a doctrine of particular\nexperience and spontaneous freedom, and emphasizes the constitutive\nimportance of lived existence for authentic knowledge. However,\ncurrent commentators of his philosophy have started questioning this\nview. Jaspers obtained his widest influence, not through his\nphilosophy, but through his writings on governmental conditions in\nGermany, and after the collapse of National Socialist regime he\nemerged as a powerful spokesperson for moral-democratic education and\nreorientation in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nDespite his importance in the evolution of both philosophy and\npolitical theory in twentieth-century Germany, today Jaspers is to a\nlarge extent a neglected thinker. The explanations that are given for\nthis are various. In the first place, it is argued that he did not\nfound a particular philosophical school. For him, philosophy is a way\nof thought, which uses expert knowledge while going beyond it. He\nbelieved that by means of devoting oneself to philosophy, individuals\ndo not cognize objects but explicate and actualize their being as\nthinkers and thus become themselves. Consequently, he did not attract\na cohort of apostles, and, outside Germany at least, his works are not\noften the subject of high philosophical discussion. This is partly the\nresult of the fact that the philosophers who now enjoy undisputed\ndominance in modern German philosophical history, especially Martin\nHeidegger, Georg Luk\u00e1cs and Theodor W. Adorno, wrote\ndisparagingly about Jaspers, and they were often unwilling to take his\nwork entirely seriously. Another explanation for Jaspers\u2019s\nrelative marginality relates to problematic nature of the English\ntranslations of his writings that render his thinking rather\nincommunicable to readers from English speaking countries. To be sure,\nhe was extremely fortunate with his many translators, the most\nprominent of whom are Ralph Manheim and E.B. Ashton. But the\ntranslations often use misleading expression, choose different words\nto express the very same word in the original German, and thus confuse\nthe readers. Also, unindicated omissions and other problems that\nresult from favouring aesthetic considerations over accuracy all\ncontribute to falsifying the original. It has been argued that Jaspers\ncould not appeal to the English-speaking philosophical mind due to\nbeing too speculative and metaphysical or simply beyond the reach of\nthe Anglo-American cultural horizons. To all these factors, one might\nadd the fact of Jaspers\u2019s association with the more prosaic\nperiods of German political life, and of his name being tarred with an\naura of staid bourgeois common sense. Nonetheless, Jaspers\u2019s\nwork set the parameters for a number of different philosophical\ndebates, the consequences of which remain deeply influential in\ncontemporary philosophy, and in recent years there have been signs\nthat a more favourable reconstructive approach to his work is\nbeginning to prevail.\n",
