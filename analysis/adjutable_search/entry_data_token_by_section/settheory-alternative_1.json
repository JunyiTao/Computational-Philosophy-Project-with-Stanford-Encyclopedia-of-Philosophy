    "main_text": "Why Set Theory? || The Dedekind construction of the reals\n1.1 The Dedekind construction of the reals\n\nIn the nineteenth century, analysis (the theory of the real numbers)\nneeded to be put on a firm logical footing. Dedekind\u2019s\ndefinition of the reals (Dedekind 1872) was a tool for this\npurpose.\n\nSuppose that the rational numbers are understood (this is of course a\nmajor assumption, but certainly the rationals are more easily\nunderstood than the reals).\n\nDedekind proposed that the real numbers could be uniquely correlated\nwith cuts in the rationals, where a cut was determined by a\npair of sets \\((L, R)\\) with the following properties: \\(L\\) and \\(R\\)\nare sets of rationals. \\(L\\) and \\(R\\) are both nonempty and every\nelement of \\(L\\) is less than every element of \\(R\\) (so the two sets\nare disjoint). \\(L\\) has no greatest element. The union of \\(L\\) and\n\\(R\\) contains all rationals.\n\nIf we understand the theory of the reals prior to the cuts, we can say\nthat each cut is of the form \\(L = (-\\infty , r) \\cap \\mathbf{Q}, R =\n[r, \\infty) \\cap \\mathbf{Q}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is the set of all\nrationals and \\(r\\) is a unique real number uniquely determining and\nuniquely determined by the cut. It is obvious that each real number\n\\(r\\) uniquely determines a cut in this way (but we need to show that\nthere are no other cuts). Given an arbitrary cut \\((L, R)\\), we\npropose that \\(r\\) will be the least upper bound of \\(L\\). The Least\nUpper Bound Axiom of the usual theory of the reals tells us that \\(L\\)\nhas a least upper bound \\((L\\) is nonempty and any element of \\(R\\)\n(which is also nonempty) is an upper bound of \\(L\\), so \\(L\\) has a\nleast upper bound). Because \\(L\\) has no greatest element, its least\nupper bound \\(r\\) cannot belong to \\(L\\). Any rational number less\nthan \\(r\\) is easily shown to belong to \\(L\\) and any rational number\ngreater than or equal to \\(r\\) is easily shown to belong to \\(R\\), so\nwe see that the cut we chose arbitrarily (and so any cut) is of the\nform \\(L = (-\\infty , r) \\cap \\mathbf{Q}, R = [r, \\infty) \\cap\n\\mathbf{Q}\\).\n\nA bolder move (given a theory of the rationals but no prior theory of\nthe reals) is to define the real numbers as cuts. Notice that\nthis requires us to have not only a theory of the rational numbers\n(not difficult to develop) but also a theory of sets of rational\nnumbers: if we are to understand a real number to be identified with a\ncut in the rational numbers, where a cut is a pair of sets of rational\nnumbers, we do need to understand what a set of rational numbers is.\nIf we are to demonstrate the existence of particular real numbers, we\nneed to have some idea what sets of rational numbers there are.\n\nAn example: when we have defined the rationals, and then defined the\nreals as the collection of Dedekind cuts, how do we define the square\nroot of 2? It is reasonably straightforward to show that \\((\\{x \\in\n\\mathbf{Q} \\mid x \\lt 0 \\vee x^2 \\lt 2\\}, \\{x \\in \\mathbf{Q} \\mid x\n\\gt 0 \\amp x^2 \\ge 2\\})\\) is a cut and (once we define arithmetic\noperations) that it is the positive square root of two. When we\nformulate this definition, we appear to presuppose that any property\nof rational numbers determines a set containing just those rational\nnumbers that have that property.\n",
