Multi-Modal Systems in Philosophical Discussions\n\nAs the previous sections indicate, the specific interplay between\ndifferent modalities (the way they are combined and which bridge\nprinciples hold) is crucial to provide an accurate representation and\nanalysis of different philosophical concepts. In fact, in several\noccasions, the combination of different modalities have shed light on\nphilosophical issues. We will illustrate this for the concepts of\nabduction, knowability, \u2018believing to know\u2019, truthmakers\nand the interplay between assumptions and beliefs while keeping in\nmind an endless list of other philosophical paradoxes and problems\nthat all arise in a multi-modal setting. (Among many others, see the\nYablo paradox in Yablo (1985, 1993) as well as the SEP discussions on\n deontic paradoxes\n and on\n paradoxes without self-reference.\n See also the SEP analyses on the\n knower paradox,\n on\n dynamic epistemic paradoxes\n and on the\n surprise examination paradox;\n for the latter, see also a proposed solution in Baltag and Smets\n(2010\n Other Internet Resources).)\n",
