    "main_text": "Imagination, Politics, Allegory || Allegory and Obscure Writing: External Layers vs. True Ideas\n7.2 Allegory and Obscure Writing: External Layers vs. True Ideas\n\n\nIt is precisely in the context of the above insights that the idea of\ninterpreting texts in terms of an external and internal\nlayer\u2014including, as we will see, allegorical interpretation of\nthe Bible\u2014becomes so important for Maimonides. For Maimonides,\nallegory \u2014 which couches difficult truths in colorful, vibrant\nimages\u2014and other forms of obscure writing emerge as especially\neffective tools for leading average people to live in accordance with\nthe truths they cannot understand on their own (in this way allowing\nthem the opportunity to live a good life) while shielding them from\nscientific and philosophical truths which would be so hard for them to\nunderstand as to (a) be unable to effect any positive outcomes in\ntheir lives, and/or (b) confuse them to the point of apostasy (an\noutcome which, for Maimonides, precisely blocks the opportunity to\nlive a good life). In this context, Maimonides sees the Bible itself\nas filled with allegorical renderings \u2014 renderings masterfully\ncrafted by Moses, the prophet par excellence. Here, the Bible is a\nliterary masterpiece penned by Moses under the inspiration of the\nactive intellect, but through his own imaginative lens: the Bible is\nin this sense the truth couched in imaginative and rhetorically\npersuasive images (such as anthropomorphic descriptions of God as\nsitting, standing, etc.).  Again (see 7.1), it is\nprecisely the Bible's construction (by Moses the prophet) through\nimaginative and rhetorically effective images and stories that enables\nit to operate upon the hearts (or, more technically, the imaginations)\nof average people, enabling them to live lives in accordance with the\ntruths that they themselves cannot grasp. For his Islamic predecessors\nit is, of course, Muhammad who plays this operative role as the\nvirtuous lawgiving prophet able to lead a community to virtue through\nthe creative imagery and persuasions of religion through the\nimaginative and rhetorically persuasive imageries of the Quran.\n\n\nAs we will discuss more below, in such a context, allegorical\ninterpretation emerges as the key method of properly interpreting the\nBible (or, in the Islamic case, the Quran). For, if the prophet pens\nthe Scripture in a way designed to couch the philosophical truth in\nimaginative images (e.g., anthropomorphic depictions of God), then the\ntrue interpretation of that Scripture must aim at uncovering the\nphilosophical truth behind the surface images.  \n\n\nMaimonides' own sensitivity to the effectiveness and necessity of\ncouching ideas in imaginative images \u2014 and, as such, the\nefficacy of giving voice to truth always indirectly \u2014 can help\nus understand (and, can afford philosophical significance to) what\nseems to be Maimonides' own indirect (and sometimes, as we have seen\nin the case of creation, downright confusing) manner of expressing\nhimself in the Guide. Relatedly, Maimonides' sensitivity to the\neffectiveness of indirectly expressing truths can help us see\nphilosophical significance in his own use of metaphors and parables,\nas well as his allegorical interpretations of the Bible throughout the\nGuide. In fact, Maimonides himself expresses the importance of\nallegory through his own allegorical rendering of the Proverbs 25:11\nidea that \u201cA word fitly spoken is like golden apples in silver\nfiligree casings\u201d (\u201ctap\u016b\u1e25\u0113y zahav\nbi-mask\u012byy\u014dt kesef, davar dav\u016br al afnav\u201d)\n(G Intro, P 11). Here, following in the spirit of al-Farabi's Platonic\n\u201cgentle physician\u201d (see above) who \u201coffers the sick\nman the drugs that are useful to him in his familiar and appetizing\nfood \u201d (PL 92), Maimonides is sensitive to the importance of\nhiding truth (gold) in more familiar (silver) garb\u2014garb which,\nalso following al-Farabi above\u2014must be attractive and fanciful\n(silver filigree) so as to impress itself upon the imagination of the\naverage person. The truths which Maimonides seeks to reveal with this\nimage are manifold: sometimes, in order to do service to the golden\ntruth, one must craft delicate silver casings (viz.,\nallegories, parables, stories, metaphors, and other effective uses of\nlanguage); these \u2018casings\u2019 are filigreed\u2014incredibly\ndifficult to make, as well as extremely beautiful and tempting to look\nat; these casings cover the golden core reality (which is to say,\nallegories hide the truth in itself), and yet, they allow onlookers to\ncatch a glimpse\u2014through the filigree's apertures\u2014of the\nvery golden core which they cover; and, finally, in at once hiding and\nrevealing the true center, these filigree casings of silver are not\nthemselves gold: where gold stands for truth, we may say that these\nfiligree casings of silver are not themselves truth. Where the casings\nare the allegories, parables, and other methods employed by the\nLawgiver (in the Bible and in other forms of religious guidance), the\nimplication is that that many of the ideas of the Bible and of\nreligion more generally (as, for example, anthropomorphic descriptions\nof God as sitting, standing, talking, willing, etc.) are not actually\ntrue. They are, rather, delicate craftings (even: works of art)\ndesigned to captivate the interests of average people and, in this\nway, lead them to living in accordance with the truth.\n\n\nAs these lessons apply to the Biblical imagery used to describe God,\nwe meet back up with our earlier ideas of apophasis (negative\ntheology) in Maimonides: Maimonides, with Islamic philosophers before\nhim, denies that God has attributes, and, as such, reads those\npassages of the Bible which describe God in human terms as allegorical\nin nature. In this regard, Maimonides seizes upon the rabbinic dictum\nthat the Torah speaks in the language of\nhumans.[28]\nBeholden to the idea of using \u201cwords fitly spoken,\u201d\nMaimonides sees the Bible as filled with allegorical constructions,\nconstructions which admit of both an external and an internal sense:\nthe external sense of the text are the \u201cwords fitly\nspoken\u201d (the \u201csilver filigree casings\u201d aimed at the\nmasses), while the internal sense\u2014the golden apple\u2014is the\nphilosophical truth reserved for the elite.\n\n\nFollowing on this general sensitivity to various layers of textual\nmeaning, Maimonides shares his penchant for allegorical reading\ntogether with many Islamic philosophical exegetes, including\nAl-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, and in this way is part of a larger\ntradition of textual interpretation (ta\u2018w\u012bl) in\nwhich Scriptures are seen as having \u201couter\u201d\n(\u1e93\u00e2hir) as well as \u201cinner\u201d\n(b\u0101\u1e6din)\n senses.[29]\n\n\nOn the importance of keeping philosophical interpretations (i.e. true\ninsights alluded to by the text) away from average people, consider\nAverroes. Reflecting in particular on texts dealing with the\nafterlife, he notes:\n\nFor anyone not adept in science, it is obligatory to take them [the\ndescriptions of the next life] in their apparent\n[\u1e93\u0101hir] sense; for him it is unbelief to interpret\nthem because it leads to unbelief. That is why we are of the opinion\nthat, for anyone among the people whose duty it is to have faith in\nthe apparent [\u1e93\u0101hir] sense, interpretation is\nunbelief because it leads to unbelief. Anyone adept in interpretation\nwho divulges that to him calls him to unbelief; and the one who calls\nto unbelief is an unbeliever [k\u0101fir]. [DT 34, B 21]\n\nWhile Averroes himself sees the surface meaning as separate from\ntruth-yielding philosophical interpretations of the scriptural text,\nhe criticizes allegorical interpretation as an allowable mode of\nscriptural interpretation for the average person as it will lead them\nto confusion and possible apostasy.\n\n \nWe might here note Kraemer\u2019s reminder too about the broader context of\nobscure writing in this milieu:\n\nAlexandrian introductions to Aristotle, which were known in the\nIslamic environment, elucidated that the aim of Aristotle\u2019s obscurity\nwas to exclude the unworthy, like curtains in temples (Kraemer 2010,\n50).\n\n\n\nTurning to an example of allegorical rendering of Scriptures in\nMaimonides' Islamic philosophical context, consider al-Farabi's\nidentification of the Trustworthy Spirit of Quran XXVI, 193 with the\nactive intellect. And, stressing the allegorical nature of the Quran,\nAvicenna describes the prophet's proper mode of communication, stating\nthat \u201ca condition the prophet must adhere to is that his words\nshould be symbols and his expression hints\u201d (PP 116). Along\nsimilar lines, speaking in general to a hermeneutics of scriptural\ninterpretation, Averroes points out that since the Quran does not\nconflict with reason, any apparently unreasonable (or, philosophically\nuntenable) Quranic verses must be read allegorically so as to be\nbrought into accordance with reason. In this spirit of allegorical\nhermeneutics, Maimonides includes \u201clexicographical\nchapters\u201d throughout his Guide in which he explains the various\nequivocal meanings of Biblical terms; this strategy can be seen in\nmany Islamic contexts, as, for example in Avicenna's f\u012b\nithb\u0101t al-nubuww\u0101t, where \u201clight\u201d is\ndefined as an equivocal term partaking of an essential as well as a\nmetaphorical meaning (PP 116).  \n\n\nIn addition to sharing the sensibility that Scripture admits of\nequivocal terms and \u201cinner meanings\u201d, Maimonides and his\nIslamic predecessors and contemporaries often draw their attention to\nvery similar sorts of scriptural claims, most notably, those\nscriptural claims (in the Bible for Maimonides, and in the Quran for\nthe Muslim thinkers) which suggest divine corporeality on their\nsurface. One example can be found in a comparison of Maimonides' and\nAverroes' respective allegorical analyses of the idea\u2014found in\nvarious guises in both the Bible and the Quran\u2014that God rests in\na place. For both thinkers, it is simply false to say of God that He\nis found in space in some place. And so, Maimonides renders this idea\nof God-in-place allegorical in his treatment of a number of Biblical\nterms, including the terms \u201cplace\u201d (maq\u014dm)\n(Guide 1.8), \u201cthrone\u201d (G 1.9), \u201cindwelling\u201d (G\n1.10; G 1.25), and \u201cto sit\u201d (G 1.11). In like manner, we\nfind Averroes' commenting too on texts suggesting that God has a place\n(or, relatedly, that He has a body)\u2014including the Quranic\ndescription of \u201cGod's directing Himself [2:29] and the Tradition\nabout His \n descent\u201d[30]\u2014as \n texts which have a surface\nmeaning which \u201cis obligatory for those adept in\ndemonstration\u201d to interpret allegorically (DT, B 19).\n\n\nIt might be noted that while Maimonides seems to see Biblical allegory\nas speaking (like any well-crafted allegory or parable) in ways most\nfit for helping its average readers, there is an odd way in which he\nalso seems to fault the Bible's frequent allegories (e.g., its talk of\nGod in corporeal terms) for providing folks with ideas about God which\nare false, and which stand, it would seem, as obstacles to their\nattainment of knowledge. Observing that \u201cman has in his nature a\nlove of, and an inclination for, that to which he is habituated\u201d\n(G 1.31, P 67), and that \u201cman has love for, and the wish to\ndefend, opinions to which he is habituated and in which he has been\nbrought up and has a feeling of repulsion for opinions other than\nthose,\u201d Maimonides notes:\n\n\nFor this reason also man is blind to the apprehension of the true\nrealities and inclines toward the things to which he is habituated.\nThis happened to the multitude with regard to the belief in His\ncorporeality and many other metaphysical subjects as we shall make\nclear. All this is due to people being habituated to, and brought up\non, texts that it is an established usage to think highly of and to\nregard as true and whose external meaning is indicative of the\ncorporeality of God and of other imaginings with no truth in them, for\nthese have been set forth as parables and riddles\u2026 (G 1.31, P\n67)\n\n\n\n\nAlong these very same lines, Maimonides wonders why some religious\npractitioners believe God to have attributes, to be corporeal and to\nbe essentially change-able in any way. To this he answers,\n\n\nFor he who believes in this doctrine was not led to it by intellectual\nspeculation; he merely followed the external sense\n(zaw\u0101hir literally \u201cexternal senses\u201d) of the\ntexts of the Scriptures (G 1.53, P 119; Munk 1931, 81).\n\n\n\n\nIt seems fair to say, in light of such passages in the Guide as the\ntwo above, that the allegorical artistry of the Bible, in its intended\neffect\u2014of leading average people to be able to live in\naccordance with the truth\u2014comes with some unpleasant side\neffects, viz. it might indeed leave some people with patently\nfalse ideas about God and reality. In a system where having knowledge\nof the truth is paramount\u2014and is even the precondition for\nprovidence (as we have seen above)\u2014the fact that the Bible's\n\u201csurface\u201d (or: \u201cexternal\u201d) sense leads some to\nembrace false beliefs is a pretty serious problem, suggesting, it\nwould seem, that the average person who needs to be led by the\nexternal sense of Biblical parables will never be able to attain the\ntrue human perfection. Here, it seems that the persuasive rhetoric of\nScripture's external sense fills the imagination with images vibrant\nenough to lead even the average person to live in accordance with\ntruth, but will, as such, stand always as a veil preventing that\nperson from ever attaining the truth per se.\n\n\nHaving explored the Islamic background, we might additionally note\nthat Maimonides himself associates the tradition of allegorical\ninterpretation of Biblical texts with Rabbinic writing strategies; as\nsuch, we may say that Maimonides sees a kinship between philosophical\nallegorization and a Biblical and Rabbinic Jewish hermeneutic at the\nheart of Judaism. \n\n\nIt is important to note in all of this that Maimonides emphasizes the\nimportance of sharing with even average people the truth of God\u2019s\nabsolute unity and (relatedly) the truth of God\u2019s incorporeality. This\nmeans, of course, that in spite of his emphasis on the need to shield\nthe golden apple of truth from the masses much of the time, Maimonides\nadvocates overtly teaching every person that the anthropomorphic\nimages in the Bible are literally false. In other words, in spite of\nMaimonides\u2019 emphasis on (a) the importance of addressing the average\nperson by way of imagination (not intellect), (b) the role of the\nBible\u2019s external layer (the \u201csilver filgree\u201d) as precisely\naimed at the imagination, and (c) the repeated appearance in the\nBible\u2019s external layer of imaginative anthropomorphic images,\nMaimonides nonetheless thinks it is important to tell people that God\nhas no body.\n\n\nWe might highlight a difference in this regard with Averroes for whom\nit is never a good idea to share any such truths with the masses (see\nPines 1969, cxviii-cxix; Stroumsa 2009, 74-76). This can be seen as\nsignaling a larger philosophical-hermeneutical divide between the two\nthinkers: Whereas both understand the difference between religion and\nphilosophy, and while both understand the role of religious scriptures\n(and religion) as aiming\u2014through its external meanings\u2014to\naddress the imaginative needs of the average person, Maimonides has a\nbroader understanding of the external layer of the text: For\nMaimonides, but not for Averroes, when it comes to the topic of divine\nembodiment, even the external layer of text, when carefully read,\noffers a non-anthropomorphic set of meanings. In line with his strong\nsense that even the average religious person must be taught that God\nis incorporeal, Maimonides sees the Bible\u2019s external claims about\ndivine corporeality as themselves beckoning\u2014even within the\nexternal layer of the text\u2014to non-corporeal meanings, even for\nthe average person. Averroes does not share this sense and, as Pines\nputs it, instead feels that \u201cthe simple faith of the average\nnonphilosophical person should not be troubled; and he should be left\nfree to stick to his own unsophisticated beliefs even in such matters\nas the corporeality of God\u201d (Pines 1969, cxix).\n\n\nStroumsa sees Maimonides as actively responding to Averroes on this\nvery point at Guide 2.25 where he emphasizes that the \u201cintention\nof the text\u201d is to offer, even at the external level, a\nnon-corporeal interpretation of anthropomorphic claims about God;\nStroumsa sees this as a response on Maimonides part to Averroes\u2019 own\ntalk of the \u201cintention of the Lawgiver\u201d which, on the\ncontrary, ensures that the external meaning of the scriptural text is\nsimply an imaginative teaching about divine corporeality aimed to\naccommodate the average person\u2019s need for\n images.[31] Reflecting\n on some of the hermeneutical tensions (or subtleties) in\nMaimonides\u2019 work, Stroumsa identifies the influence of\nal-Ghazali\u2019s Fay\u1e63al where Maimonides tries to save\nmidrashic ideas by describing them as allegories, and the influence of\nAverroes where Maimonides emphasizes the importance of the reader\u2019s\nstaying within the limits of her ability to understand\ntruths.[32]\n",
