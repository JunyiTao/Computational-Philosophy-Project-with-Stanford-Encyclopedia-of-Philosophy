The Historical Development of Leibniz\u2019s Physics\n\n\nIn his earliest days, Leibniz read a wide range of works \ndrawn from his father\u2019s considerable library. Later he was formally \neducated at the University of Leipzig (1661\u20131666), briefly at the \nUniversity of Jena (1663), and finally at the University of Altdorf \n(1666\u20131667). From these sources, Leibniz gained an early acquaintance\nwith the Aristotelian-Scholastic tradition, as well as a taste of \nneo-platonic themes common in Renaissance humanism. By his own \naccount, he quickly \u201cpenetrated far into the territory of the \nScholastics,\u201d and derived \u201csome satisfaction\u201d from \n\u201cPlato too, and Plotinus\u201d (G III 606/L 655). Although he \nconsciously broke with the Scholastic tradition while still quite \nyoung, its doctrines clearly made a lasting impression on him, and \nserved him both as a font of ideas and a readily available target of \ncriticism. Indeed, one can justifiably see many of Leibniz\u2019s mature \ndoctrines as reactions \u2013 either positive or negative \u2013 to\nthe Scholastic views that he first became acquainted with while still\na student in Germany.\n\n\nAccording to his own recollection, it appears that Leibniz threw \nhimself into the mechanical philosophy sometime around the year \n 1661.[1]\n In a well-known letter to Nicolas Remond, Leibniz \u2013 then in the\ntwilight of his years \u2013 recounted his early conversion:\n\n\nAfter having finished the trivial \n schools[2],\n I fell upon the moderns, and I recall walking in a grove on the \noutskirts of Leipzig called the Rosental, at the age of fifteen, and \ndeliberating whether to preserve substantial forms or not. Mechanism \nfinally prevailed and led me to apply myself to mathematics. (G III \n606/L 655) \n\n\nAlthough we have no records of Leibniz\u2019s work from the years \nimmediately following his youthful adoption of mechanism, there is \nabundant evidence that by the late 1660s, he had studied the \nwritings of a wide range of mechanistic\n philosophers,[3]\n committed himself to the \u201chypothesis of the moderns, which \nconceives no incorporeal entities within bodies but assumes nothing \nbeyond magnitude, figure, and \n motion,\u201d[4]\n and had begun to search for ways to improve the \nmechanistic philosophy of his\n predecessors.[5]\n\n\n\nThe early influence of natural philosophers such as Gassendi and \nHobbes \u2013 whom Leibniz would later characterize as working in the \nEpicurean tradition \u2013 is particularly apparent in his first \npair of systematic works on motion. In the Theoria motus \nabstracti (TMA), dedicated to the French Academy in 1671, \nLeibniz introduces a set of abstract laws of motion (A \nVI.ii.261\u2013276/L 139\u2013142). At the heart of those laws is the Hobbesian\nnotion of conatus, which Leibniz describes as \u201cthe beginning \nand end of motion,\u201d and which he seems to conceive of as a \ntendency to motion in a particular direction. Leibniz argues that the\nmotion of a body in isolation is determined entirely by its own \nconatus, and that the motions of colliding bodies are determined \nsolely by the combination of their respective conatuses. In this way,\nLeibniz\u2019s abstract theory of motion assigns no role whatsoever, with \nrespect to the fundamental laws of motion, to the sizes or masses of \nmaterial bodies. According to the TMA, a tiny pebble with a certain \nvelocity striking a large boulder at rest would, under idealized \nconditions, continue to move with the boulder with the same velocity \nthat it had initially. \n\n\nLeibniz, of course, recognized that the laws of motion sketched in \nthe TMA are radically at odds with the testimony of everyday \nexperience. After all, it would seem to be the case that if the world\nwere governed by the laws of the TMA, it should be no more difficult \nto move a planet than a \n pebble.[6]\n Leibniz sought to close this gap between the fundamental laws and \nexperience with the publication of his Hypothesis physica \nnova (HPN) also known as the Theoria motus concreti, \nwhich he also dedicated in 1671, this time to the Royal Society of \nLondon (A.VI.ii.221\u2013257). In the HPN, Leibniz argues that the laws of\nthe TMA yield the Huygens-Wren laws of impact when taken together \nwith the contingent structure of the actual world. Central to \nLeibniz\u2019s strategy is the idea that all bodies in the actual world \nare elastic due to a pervasive aether, and are composed of discrete \nparticles. Although mass continues to play no foundational role in \nhis applied system of physics, Leibniz is cleverly able to argue that\nlarger bodies will generally be more resistant to motion due to the \nlarger number of particles from which they are constituted. A pebble \nstriking a planet will thus fail to have any significant effect \nbecause the pebble\u2019s velocity is propagated to the planet not at a \nsingle blow but particle by particle. Its motion is consequently \ndiluted \u2013 and even reversed \u2013 as it is repeatedly summed \nwith the velocity of each subsequent particle.\n\n\nIn 1672, Leibniz was sent to Paris as part of a diplomatic mission \nwhere he stayed \u2013 short trips aside \u2013 for the next four \nyears. His time spent in the intellectually vibrant French capital \nproved crucial to the development of his mature views in physics. \nWhile in Paris, Leibniz gained an expert\u2019s knowledge of the \nmathematics of his time, embarked on an intensive study of Cartesian \nphysics, and made contact with many of the leading natural \nphilosophers of his day. \n\n\nIn such fertile circumstances \u2013 which included tutoring by \nHuygens himself and direct access to Descartes\u2019s unpublished \nnotebooks \u2013 Leibniz quickly fashioned his own penetrating \ncritique of Cartesian physics. As early as \n 1676,[7]\n he had found what he considered to be a fatal flaw in Descartes\u2019s \ncornerstone conservation law, namely, that it violates the principle \nof the equality of cause and effect. When Leibniz published \nessentially the same objection in his Brief Demonstration of a \nNotable Error of Descartes\u2019s and Others Concerning a Natural Law\nin 1686, it sparked a now famous dispute among natural philosophers \nthat has become known as the vis viva controversy \n(GM VI 117\u2013119/L \n 296\u2013298).[8]\n For Leibniz the argument of the Brief Demonstration marked \nnot only an important event in his understanding of the Cartesian \nsystem, but also a turning point in the development of his own \ndistinctive physics. \n\n\nOn the one hand, the argument of the Brief Demonstration\nforced Leibniz to rethink the foundations of his early theory of\nmotion. For the charge of violating the principle of the equality of\ncause and effect that he leveled against Cartesians spoke as well\nagainst the laws of the TMA and the HPN. The paradoxical result of the\nideal laws of the TMA \u2013 that a tiny body moving with a given\nspeed might impart the same speed to a relatively enormous body\n\u2013 appeared, at least intuitively, as an example of a potentially\neven greater increase in local force than anything allowed by\nDescartes\u2019s rules of impact. Conversely, according to the\nphenomenal laws of the HPN, since the combination by impact of two\nconatuses can fall short, but never exceed, the strict sum of the\nconatuses of the two individual bodies, the total conatus present in\nthe world must naturally decline over time \u2013 another violation\nof the equality principle. In short, in the argument of the Brief\nDemonstration, Leibniz found a devastating criticism not only of\nCartesian physics, but also of Early Leibnizian physics. \n\n\nOn the other hand, Leibniz\u2019s embrace of the principle of the equality\nof cause and effect helped inspire his development of a series of \nambitious positions that would collectively serve as the moorings of \nhis mature physics. The failure of Descartes\u2019s conservation law \nencouraged Leibniz to attach new significance to an alternative \nconservation principle that he had learned from Huygens by 1669 at \nthe \n latest.[9]\n Leibniz came to see that if force is taken to be equivalent to the \nquantity of vis viva \u2013 rather than the quantity of \nmotion as Descartes had implied \u2013 then, in cases such as those \nhighlighted by the Brief Demonstration, no violation of the \nprinciple of equality of cause and effect need be tolerated. In \nsubsequent works, including his Dynamica de Potentia et Legibus \nNaturae corporea (1689), Essay of Dynamics on the Laws of \nMotion \u2026 (1690), and Specimen\nDynamicum (1695), Leibniz attempts to build on this \ndiscovery by suggesting further implications not only for the \nconservation of force, but also for the laws of motion and even the \nfundamental nature of physical bodies. One can see in\nhis devastating critique of the Cartesian conservation law the seeds \nof much of what is distinctive in his own mature physics.\n\n\nAlthough Leibniz continued to refine, develop, and extend his views \non the laws of motion and impact, his work in the philosophy of \nphysics was most famously capped by his correspondence with\nSamuel Clarke [10]\n The controversy between Leibniz and Clarke began when the \nPrincess of Wales passed along to \nClarke in 1715 a letter written by Leibniz decrying the decline of \nreligion in England inspired by the rise of Newton\u2019s natural \nphilosophy. Taking place against the backdrop of a bitter dispute \nover the priority of the calculus, Clarke responded in Newton\u2019s \ndefense and a series of five letters and replies were exchanged. \nAmong the many topics covered in the correspondence, the letters are \nbest known for the opposing views of space and time which they offer:\nLeibniz defending roughly the view that space is an ideal system of \nrelations holding between bodies, and Clarke defending the view that \nspace is something more like a container in which bodies are located \nand move. The increasingly detailed and pointed exchange ended only \nwith Leibniz\u2019s death in 1716, with Clarke, in the historical sense at\nleast, having the last word. \n2. Leibniz on matter\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s views on the nature of matter are subtle and layered. From \nthe time of his youthful conversion in the Rosental, he remained \nbroadly sympathetic to the explanatory project of the new mechanical \nphilosophy and its ambition to explain natural phenomena in terms of \nmatter and motion rather than in terms of a wide range of irreducible\nformal natures. In spite of this general sympathy, however, he was \nalso one of the most penetrating critics of the dominant conceptions \nof matter in the mechanistic tradition. This section looks first at \nLeibniz\u2019s critiques of the two most important of those conceptions \nbefore turning to his own positive account of the passive powers of \nbodies. \n2.1 The critique of atomism\n\n\nAlthough there was much disagreement over details, early modern \natomists generally affirmed that complex bodies are to be understood \nas being composed of naturally indivisible material atoms moving \nabout in an independently existing space. Such atoms were commonly \nheld to lack all but a few basic properties such as size, shape, and \npossibly weight. While Leibniz himself was attracted to such a \nconception of body in his early years, he eventually came to see \natomism as deeply antithetical to his general understanding of the \nnatural world. Not surprisingly then, many of Leibniz\u2019s arguments \nagainst atomism attempt to show how common atomist commitments \nconflict with central principles of his mature natural \n philosophy.[11]\n\n\n\nOne such argument highlights a tension between Leibniz\u2019s principle of\ncontinuity \u2013 according to which \u201cno change happens \nthrough a leap\u201d \u2013 and the common assumption that material\natoms must be perfectly hard and inflexible. Taking for granted this \nsupposed perfect hardness and inflexibility, Leibniz argues that the \ncollision of any two atoms would lead to a discontinuous change in \nnature: \n\n\n[I]f we were to imagine that there are atoms, that is, bodies of \nmaximal hardness and therefore inflexible, it would follow that there\nwould be a change through a leap, that is, an instantaneous change. \nFor at the very moment of collision the direction to the motion \nreverses itself, unless we assume that the bodies come to rest \nimmediately after the collision, that is, lose their force; beyond \nthe fact that it would be absurd in other ways, this contains, again,\na change through a leap, and instantaneous change from motion to \nrest, without passing through the intermediate steps. (SD II.3/AG \n132)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s suggestion here is that collisions between perfectly hard, \ninflexible atoms would violate the principle of continuity since \n\u2013 being unable to flex or give \u2013 their directions and \nspeeds would have to change instantaneously upon contact. Tacitly \nrejecting the possibility that continuity could be preserved by \naction at a distance, Leibniz insists that continuity presupposes \nelasticity, and that elasticity in turn presupposes having parts that\ncan move relative to one another. Given that the original argument \ncan be invoked no matter how small the colliding bodies, Leibniz \nconcludes that all bodies must be elastic, and must\ntherefore have parts, contrary to the central thesis of atomism.\nHe thus concludes that \u201cno body is so small that it is without \nelasticity, and furthermore \u2026 there are no elements of bodies \n\u2026 nor are there little solid globes \u2026 both determinate \nand hard. Rather, the analysis proceeds to infinity\u201d \n(SD.II.45/AG 132\u2013133). \n\n\nAnother line of argument offered by Leibniz against material atomism \nhighlights a tension with what might be called his \u201cprinciple \nof plentitude.\u201d That principle, grounded in Leibniz\u2019s broader \ntheological and metaphysical views, maintains that existence itself \nis good, and as a consequence God creates as much being as is \nconsistent with the laws of logic and his own moral goodness. \nNaturally, Leibniz sees the principle of plentitude as being \ninconsistent with the existence of a barren void or interspersed \nvacua:\n\n\n[T]o admit the void in nature is ascribing to God a very imperfect\nwork \u2026 I lay it down as a principle that every perfection which\nGod could impart to things, without derogating from their other\nperfections, has actually been imparted to them. Now let us fancy a\nspace wholly empty. God could have placed some matter in it without\nderogating, in any respect, from all other things; therefore, he has\nactually placed some matter in that space; therefore, there is no\nspace wholly empty; therefore, all is full. (G VII.378/AG\n332)\n\n\nInterestingly, Leibniz uses the principle of plentitude not only to \nargue against the atomists\u2019 postulation of empty space, but \nalso against the possibility of simple indivisible atoms themselves. \nFor, Leibniz argues, no matter how small one imagines atoms to be, as\nlong as they are reckoned internally simple and homogenous, the world\ncould still contain more variety, richness, and being if they were \nmore finely divided. He thus draws the characteristic conclusion that\n\u201cThe least corpuscle is actually subdivided in infinitum and \ncontains a world of other creatures which would be wanting in the \nuniverse if that corpuscle were an atom, that is, a body of one \nentire piece without subdivision\u201d (G VII.377\u2013378/AG 332).\n\n\nA third, somewhat obscure, but especially intriguing line of argument\ntakes off from a position defended by Descartes in his Principles\nof Philosophy and touches on Leibniz\u2019s work on the so-called \n\u201cLabyrinth of the Continuum.\u201d In the Principles,\nDescartes had argued that (i) the world is a plenum, (ii) all motion \nin a plenum must be circular, and (iii) such circular motion \npresupposes the \u201cinfinite, or indefinite, division of the \nvarious particles of matter\u201d as they adjust and shift to \naccommodate a continuous flow around bends and through narrows (AT \nVIIIA.59/CSM 1:239). Concerning these propositions, Leibniz \napprovingly remarks, \u201cWhat Descartes says here is most \nbeautiful and worthy of his genius, namely, that every motion in \nfilled space involves circulation and that matter must somewhere be \nactually divided into parts smaller than any given quantity\u201d (L\n393). But whereas Descartes had insisted only on the \n\u201cindefinite\u201d division of \u201cmerely some part of \nmatter\u201d (AT VIIIA.60/CSM 239) Leibniz pushes for a stronger \nconclusion. Dismissing Descartes\u2019s cautious \u201cindefinite \ndivision\u201d as \u201cbeing not in the thing, but in the \nthinker,\u201d he takes the argument to show that every part of \nmatter is actually infinitely divided (A VI.ii.264). Similarly, \nrather than apparently restricting the infinite division of matter to\nsome select moving parts, Leibniz maintains that every part of matter\nis everywhere moving, and so the sort of accommodation envisioned by \nDescartes must occur everywhere (A. 6.3.565f; 6.3.58f). Thus, for \nLeibniz, not only are some parts of matter actually infinitely \ndivided, but every part of matter is divided to infinity (Levey 1998,\nfn6)!\n\n\nThe actual infinite division of all matter is, of course, sufficient \nto rule out any standard picture of material atomism since any body \nthat might lay claim to being an indivisible atom would itself be \nactually subdivided into smaller sub-bodies. But Leibniz is not done.\nEven more radically, he argues that Descartes\u2019s initial \nconsiderations lead not \u201cmerely\u201d to the conclusion that \nthere are no smallest bodies, but furthermore show that strictly \nspeaking no determinate shapes can be ascribed to bodies at all. \n\n\n[W]ith respect to shape, I uphold another paradox, namely, that there\nis no shape exact and real, and that neither sphere, nor parabola, \nnor other perfect shape will ever be found in body\u2026. One will\nalways find there inequalities to infinity. That comes about because \nmatter is actually subdivided to infinity. (translated, Sleigh 1990, \n112) \n\n\nAlthough how to best interpret Leibniz\u2019s arguments for the ideality \nof exact shape \u2013 and indeed how to best interpret his \nadmittedly paradoxical conclusion \u2013 remains open for debate, \nthe general idea here seems clear enough. While mechanistic physics \nappeals to exact shapes like cubes and spheres, the actual \ninfinite division of matter reveals that these can be at best \napproximations of the shapes of real bodies. For the shapes of real \nbodies must \u2013 again at best \u2013 be infinitely complex since\nthey are everywhere divided into bodies actually distinct in virtue \nof their differing accommodating motions. Although Leibniz\u2019s \nconclusion is especially bold and enigmatic, it is nonetheless not \nuntypical for him in so far as it suggests that mechanism \u2013 carefully thought \nthrough \u2013 points towards a radically different underlying metaphysical \nreality. \n2.2 The critique of Cartesian corpuscularianism\n\n\nLeibniz allied himself with Descartes and most later Cartesians in \nopposing material atomism. Nonetheless he was equally concerned to \nrebut the Cartesian account of matter according to which the whole \nessence of matter is extension \u2013 that is, the thesis that \nmatter is something like geometrical extension made concrete. \nAlthough Leibniz characteristically offers a wide range of arguments \nagainst the Cartesian identification of matter with extension, it \nwill serve our purposes to focus on three especially \nimportant arguments all rooted in the guiding idea that the notion of\nextension is simply too impoverished to provide an intelligible \nfoundation for physics. \n\n\nThe first of these arguments presses on the relationship between the \nnature of matter and the laws of motion. Leibniz, in effect, argues \nthat the thesis that the whole essence of matter is extension saddles\nCartesians with a dilemma: they must either hold that the laws of \nmotion are grounded in the nature of extension, or that God acts \ndirectly to bring about the lawful regularities that are observed in \nthe world. Leibniz maintains that the first horn is inconsistent with\nthe true laws of motion, while the second horn leads to the untenable\npostulation of perpetual miracles. In order to better appreciate \nLeibniz\u2019s line of reasoning here, it is worth unpacking a \nlittle his thinking with respect to each horn of the dilemma. \n\n\nBehind Leibniz\u2019s rejection of the first horn lies the assumption that\nif bodies were nothing but matter, and matter nothing but extension, \nthen bodies would be wholly and essentially passive. But if bodies \nwere wholly and essentially passive, Leibniz reasons, they would \nnecessarily be entirely indifferent to motion, and consequently they \nwould obey radically different laws of motion than the ones we \nactually observe: \n\n\nIf there were nothing in bodies but extended mass and nothing in \nmotion but change of place and if everything should and could be \ndeduced solely from these definitions by geometrical necessity, it \nwould follow \u2026 that upon contact the smallest body would \nimpart its own speed to the largest body without losing any of this \nspeed; and we would have to accept a number of such rules which are \ncompletely contrary to the formation of a system. (DM 21/AG 53\u201354)\n\n\nThere is, of course, some irony in Leibniz\u2019s argument here. For, as \nwe noted above, in his early theory of motion Leibniz himself held \nthat bodies offer no resistance to being moved, and thus that it \nwould take no more effort to budge a boulder than a bobby pin. In his\nlater works, however, Leibniz rejects the ideal laws of motion that \nhe had espoused in the TMA, while nonetheless continuing to hold that\nif matter were indifferent to motion, then the laws\nof his abstract theory of motion would hold. Leibniz thus concludes \nthat since his early laws of motion do not govern actual bodies, \nbodies must not be indifferent to motion, and thus must not be \n\u2013 as Descartes had maintained \u2013 simply bits of \ngeometrical extension made real. \n\n\nAll of this, of course, might seem to simply put greater pressure on \nthe second horn of Leibniz\u2019s dilemma. For it might seem that it is \nopen to Descartes\u2019s defenders to maintain that the laws of motion are\nthe result of God\u2019s direct decree, and that consequently they do not \n\u2013 as Leibniz seems to assume \u2013 follow from the nature of \nbody as such. (Indeed, Descartes himself implies that the laws of \nmotion follow inexorably not from the nature of matter, but rather \nfrom the nature of God (AT VIIIA 61\u201362/CSM 1:240).) For Leibniz, \nhowever, such a view is equivalent to conceding that the laws of \nnature hold by dint of divine miracle since \u201cproperly speaking,\nGod performs a miracle when he does something that surpasses the \nforces he has given to creatures and conserves in them\u201d (Letter\nto Arnauld, 30 April 1687, G II 93/AG 83). Thus, for Leibniz, a \nmiracle occurs when a creature performs an action that does not flow \nfrom its own natural powers, and so bodies could obey laws of motion \nnot grounded in their own natural powers only through the advent of a\nperpetual miracle. If Leibniz\u2019s understanding of miracles is granted,\nhis second horn is thus much harder to resist than one might have \notherwise supposed. \n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s second argument focuses on the ability of Cartesian physics\nto account for qualitative variety in the world. The thesis that the \nwhole essence of matter is extension blocks Descartes from holding \nthat matter is itself intrinsically diverse as well as from supposing\nthat matter is differentially distributed in empty space. Clearly \nrecognizing the constraints imposed by his reductive account of body,\nDescartes elegantly maintains that all qualitative variety is to be \ngrounded in the motion of bodies, that is, that \u201cAll the \nvariety in matter, all the diversity of its forms, depends on \nmotion\u201d (Principles 2:23/CSM 1:232). Qualitative variety \namongst bodies for Descartes thus appears to be grounded not in the \nintrinsic natures of bodies or their parts, but rather in the way in \nwhich the parts of bodies move relative to one another. To take an \nexample friendly to Descartes, it might be supposed that the \nqualitative differences between a block of ice, a puddle of water, \nand a cloud are to be explained not by appeal to intrinsic \ndifferences in the elements that constitute them, nor by appeal to \nthe density of their elements in space, but rather in terms of the \nrelative speeds holding between those elements. One might thus \nimagine \u2013 incorrectly of course \u2013 that the hardness of \nice depends only on water molecules being at rest with respect to one\nanother, the fluidity of water only on water molecules moving with \nrespect to one another at a moderate speed, and the etherealness of a\ncloud only on water molecules moving with an extreme relative speed. \n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s ingenious attack on this Cartesian model of qualitative \nvariety proceeds in two steps. The first step charges that motion \nalone is unable to account for qualitative variety at an instant: \nsince all qualitative variety in the Cartesian system depends on \nmotion, and there is no motion in an instant, it follows that in a \nCartesian world there could be no qualitative variety at an \n instant.[12]\n The second step of Leibniz\u2019s argument charges that if the world is \nqualitatively homogenous at every instant, then it must be \nqualitatively homogenous over time as well. For if the world is \nqualitatively undifferentiated at each instant, then every instant \nwill be qualitatively identical, and so the world as a whole will not\nundergo any qualitative change as it passes from one instant to the \nnext. To use an anachronistic analogy, the two steps taken together \nimply that a Cartesian world would be like a filmstrip whose every \nframe is blank, and thus whose projection would not only be \nhomogenous at each instant, but through time as well.\n\n\nA third argument, especially important in connection with Leibniz\u2019s \nmore general metaphysics, takes issue with the implication that \nCartesian bodies \u2013 or at least Cartesian matter taken as a \nwhole \u2013 might be on a metaphysical par with created minds. \nAgain, it might be helpful to see Leibniz\u2019s thinking here as \nproceeding in two steps. First, drawing on principles integral to his\nmetaphysics, Leibniz insists that independence and \nunity are marks of true substances. The independence \ncriterion suggests that we can usefully distinguish between created \nsubstances that depend only upon God for their existence, and \nderivative creatures that depend not only upon God but also upon the \nexistence of created substances as well. The unity criterion implies \na distinction between creatures that are true, indivisible unities, \nand creatures that are mere accidental unities, or \n\u201caggregates.\u201d Leibniz maintains that only the former have\na rightful claim to being genuine created substances, since, as he \nfamously puts it in a letter to Arnauld, \u201cwhat is not truly \none being is not truly one being either\u201d (G \nII.97/AG 86).\n\n\nWith his two criteria in hand, Leibniz next argues that the bodies of\nCartesian physics fail to meet the standards for created substances \ntwice over. For on the one hand, every Cartesian body must be \nextended and divisible, and so must be composed of parts. But this, \nLeibniz maintains, is sufficient by itself to show that Cartesian \nbodies are not fundamental created entities: for if every Cartesian \nbody is composed of parts, then by the independence criterion, the \nparts will be more fundamentally real than the wholes which they \ncompose. No body whose essence is simply extension could therefore be\na genuine created substance according to Leibniz. On the other hand, \naccording to Descartes\u2019s physics the only principle available to \nunite bodies \u2013 at least as they are studied by physicists \n\u2013 is motion. But it is clear that Leibniz thinks that the sort \nof unity that might be provided by mere common motion is insufficient\nfor genuine, substantial unity. Even if an army were to always march \nin perfect step, it would still not be a unity per se, and \nthus would not be \u201ctruly one being either\u201d (G II\n76/AG 79). Thus measured either by the standards of the independence \ncriterion or the unity criterion, Cartesian bodies can be shown to be\nnot fully real in the deepest sense available to created beings. In \nthis thought, Leibniz sees not only an important contrast with human \nminds \u2013 which as partless simples are plausibly independent and\nunified \u2013 but also another indication that mechanistic physics \nmust itself rest on a deeper metaphysical reality quite different \nfrom the \u201cmanifest image\u201d with which we are familiar from\neveryday experience. \n2.3 The passive powers of bodies\n\n\nMuch about Leibniz\u2019s own positive conception of matter as it is \nstudied by physics can be gleaned from his criticisms of his \npredecessors. So, for example, his critique of atomism already \nsuggests that Leibnizian bodies must always be flexible or \n\u201csoft\u201d to some \n degree,[13]\n fill every region of the natural world, and be infinitely divisible, \nindeed, be infinitely divided. Likewise, his critique of the \nCartesian conception of matter implies that the properties of bodies \nare not limited to their passive powers, that bodies must always \nadmit of intrinsic variety, and that ordinary physical objects such \nas desks and chairs must be ontologically dependent upon a deeper \nlevel of metaphysical reality. Nonetheless, we should be able to get \nan even better grip on Leibniz\u2019s positive conception of matter by \nlooking more explicitly at four passive powers, or forces, which he \nattributes to bodies as they are studied by the physicist. \n\n\n(1) As we noted above, the physics of the TMA assigns to bodies no \nresistance to motion, and thus predicts that under idealized \nconditions it should be no harder to move something massive than \nsomething minuscule. In distancing himself from this early view, \nLeibniz comes to argue that, in fact, matter \u201cresists being \nmoved through a certain natural inertia it has \u2026 so \nthat it is not indifferent to motion and rest, as is commonly \nbelieved, but requires more active force for motion in proportion to \nits size\u201d (G IV.510/AG 161). In short, Leibniz came to maintain\nthat bodies have an intrinsic power resistant to motion, which he \ncalls, following Kepler, \u201cnatural inertia.\u201d \nSignificantly, Leibnizian natural inertia is a force which is opposed\nto motion itself, and not merely, as Newton held, to changes in \nvelocity. Thus, while Newton maintains that no active force is \nrequired to keep a body moving with a constant velocity under \nidealized conditions, Leibniz maintains that a body in motion in the \nabsence of any countervailing active force will naturally come to \nrest. \n\n\n(2) In addition to offering resistance to motion, Leibniz thought it\nessential to bodies that they resist mutual collocation \u2013 to\nsome degree, they must be \u201csolid\u201d or impenetrable.  In\nattributing solidity to bodies, Leibniz rejects the Cartesian\nsuggestion that impenetrability simply follows from the property of a\nbody\u2019s being extended. For, Leibniz argues, it could be the case\nthat a body\u2019s solidity is due to a body\u2019s having a certain\nreluctance \u2013 but not an unconquerable one \u2013 to share a\nplace with another body, and thus he implies that it is, for example,\nat least conceivable that two bodies might be forced to overlap in\nmuch the same way that we generally imagine bodies and regions of\nspace to coincide (NE, Book II, Ch. iv). Having distinguished solidity\nfrom extension, Leibniz goes on to further distinguish solidity from\nhardness. He suggests that whereas solidity concerns the ability of a\nbody to resist being collocated with another body, hardness concerns\nthe ability of a body to resist changing its shape or structure. Thus\na body, according to Leibniz, might be perfectly solid\n(i.e. impenetrable) and yet not hard, a point he illustrates by noting\nthat \u201cif two bodies were simultaneously inserted into the two\nopen ends of a tube, into which each of them fitted tightly, the\nmatter which was already in the tube, however, fluid [or\n\u2018soft\u2019] it might be, [the matter] would resist just\nbecause of its sheer impenetrability [i.e.\n\u2018solidity\u2019]\u201d (NE, Book II, Ch. iv).\n\n\n(3) In addition to the (relatively) basic powers of natural inertia \nand solidity, Leibniz recognizes two further derived passive powers \nof bodies. The first, which we might call \u201cfirmness\u201d or \n\u201ccohesiveness,\u201d concerns the ability of a body to resist \nbeing scattered or torn into pieces. (An egg and a baseball differ \nnot only with respect to their \u201cnatural inertia\u201d and \nimpenetrability, but also with respect to their ability to hold \nthemselves together, as it were, under impact.) In the New \nEssays, Leibniz writes:\n\n\nBut now a new element enters the picture, namely firmness or\nthe bonding of one body to another. This bonding often results in \none\u2019s being unable to push one body without at the same time pushing \nanother which is bonded to it, so that there is a kind of \ntraction of the second body. Because of this bonding, there \nwould be resistance even if there were no inertia or manifest \nimpetus. For \u2026 if space were full of small cubes, a hard body \nwould encounter resistance to its being moved among them. This is \nbecause the little cubes \u2013 just because they were hard, i.e. \nbecause their parts were bonded together \u2013 would be difficult \nto split up finely enough to permit circular movement in which the \nposition being evacuated by the moving body would at once be refilled\nby something else. (NE Book II, Ch. iv)\n\n\nAlthough Leibniz recognizes \u201cfirmness\u201d as an important \npassive power attributable to bodies, like many other mechanists, he \nis reluctant to posit the existence of primitive attractive forces \nin nature (SD II.52/AG 136; see also Leibniz\u2019s Fifth Letter to \nClarke, paragraph 35/Alexander 66). He thus insists that firmness is \na derived passive power of bodies since \u201cwe should not explain \nfirmness except through the surrounding bodies pushing a body \ntogether\u201d (SD II.52/AG 136). \n\n\n(4) A final passive property of bodies might go without mention if \nnot for the special twist that Leibniz puts on it. Even while arguing\nagainst the Cartesian thesis that the whole essence of matter is \nextension, Leibniz could hardly deny that bodies as they are studied \nby physicists are extended, or if one prefers, that they have the \nproperty of physical extension. Nonetheless, Leibniz intriguingly \nsuggests that physical extension \u2013 far from constituting the \nwhole essence of matter \u2013 is not even a basic property of \nbodies. In an informative piece dated to 1702, Leibniz writes:\n\n\n\u2026 I believe that the nature of body does not consist in \nextension alone \u2026 since extension is a continuous and \nsimultaneous repetition \u2026 it follows that whenever the same \nnature is diffused through many things at the same time, as, for \nexample, malleability or specific gravity or yellowness is in gold, \nwhiteness is in milk, and resistance or impenetrability is generally \nin body, extension is said to have place \u2026 From this, it is \nobvious that extension is not an absolute predicate, but is relative \nto that which is extended or diffused, and therefore it cannot be \nseparated from the nature of that which is diffused \u2026 (G \nIV.393f/AG 251; see also GP II 269/AG 179, and GP II 183/L 519).\n\n\n\nLeibniz thus grants that while physical extension is to be ascribed \nto the bodies of physics, it is not to be treated as a basic or \nfundamental property of matter. Rather, physical extension itself is \nto be understood as a repetition, or distribution, of more basic \nforces. Leibniz\u2019s radical suggestion would, in effect, turn the \nCartesian understanding of matter on its head: whereas, for example, \nDescartes attempted to explain solidity in terms of physical \n extension,[14]\n Leibniz proposes to explain physical extension in terms of solidity \n\u2013 a body isn\u2019t solid because it is extended, it is \nextended because it has the ability to exclude other bodies! \n3. Leibniz\u2019s Dynamics\n\n\nOne of the cornerstones of Leibniz\u2019s mature physics is to be found in\nhis thesis that the bodies studied by physicists must be viewed not \nonly in terms of passive powers and motion, but also active forces. \nThis section sketches Leibniz\u2019s chief physical argument for the \npostulation of active forces and then looks respectively at the roles\nthat active forces play in his mature physics and how they are \nrelated to his deeper metaphysics. \n3.1 A Brief Demonstration\n\n\nIn his Principles of Philosophy, Descartes had argued that \nthe quantity of motion in the world remains constant, where the \nquantity of motion of a body is determined by its speed times its \nsize. So, for example, at Principles 2:36, Descartes argues \nthat \u201cif one part of matter moves twice as fast as another \nwhich is twice as large, we must consider that there is the same \nquantity of motion in each part; and if one part slows down, we must \nsuppose that some other part of equal size speeds up by the same \namount\u201d (AT VIIIA 61/CSM 240). This general conservation \nprinciple, which Descartes takes to be grounded in God\u2019s immutable \nnature, in turn serves as the foundation for his three laws of motion\nas well as his rules of impact. \n\n\nIn a short piece fully and tellingly entitled A Brief \nDemonstration of a Notable Error of Descartes and Others Concerning a\nNatural Law, According to which God is Said Always to Conserve the \nSame Quantity of Motion; a Law which They also Misuse in \nMechanics, Leibniz publicly attacked Descartes\u2019s conservation \nprinciple and thereby the foundations of Cartesian physics (GM \nVI.117\u2013119/L 296\u2013302). The central argument of the Brief \nDemonstration is ingenious and elegant, but only deceptively \nstraightforward, and Leibniz continued to develop and expand upon its\ncentral theme for many years after its initial public presentation in\n 1686.[15]\n\n\n\nAt the heart of Leibniz\u2019s main line of argument lie four premises: \n(1) The amount of force a body acquires in virtue of falling from a \ncertain altitude is equal to the amount of force that would be \nrequired to raise that same body to the same altitude. (2) The amount\nof force a one pound body acquires by falling from a height of four \nmeters is equal to the amount of force a four pound body acquires by \nfalling from a height of one meter. (3) Galileo\u2019s Law: the distance \ntraveled by a falling body is directly proportional to the square of \nthe time it falls (i.e. d = at2 where a \nis a constant); so, to illustrate, a falling body traveling a \ndistance of one meter in one second will travel four meters in two \nseconds, nine meters in three seconds, and sixteen meters in four \nseconds, \n etc.[16]\n (4) The total amount of force in the world is conserved both locally \nand globally with the result that there is always as much force in a \ncause as in its effect.\n\n\nUsing these four premises, Leibniz attempts to establish three \nprincipal conclusions. First, he argues that Descartes\u2019s quantity of \nmotion is not an adequate measure of force. To see this, suppose that\na four pound brick falls from a height of one meter in one second. \nIts quantity of motion = 1 m/s \u00d7 4lbs = 4 units. By Galileo\u2019s \nLaw it follows that a one pound brick dropped under similar \ncircumstances will travel four meters in two seconds (since the \ndistance traversed is proportional to the square of time). \nThe quantity of motion of a one pound brick falling through a \ndistance of four meters therefore = 2 m/s \u00d7 1lbs = 2 units. \nSince by the second premise the force of the two bodies is equal, but\ntheir quantities of motion are unequal, Leibniz concludes that \nquantity of motion is an inadequate measure of force. \n\n\nSecond, Leibniz is similarly able to argue that the quantity of \nvis viva (mv2) is an adequate \nmeasure of force. For, the quantity of vis viva of \nthe four pound brick falling from a height of one meter = \n(1m/s)2 \u00d7 4 lbs = 1 m/s \u00d7 4lbs = 4 units, and\nthe quantity of vis viva of the one pound brick \nfalling from a height of four meters = (2 m/s)2 \u00d7 1 \nlbs = 4 m/s \u00d7 1 lbs = 4 units. Thus if force is measured by \nthe quantity of vis viva rather than the quantity \nof motion the equality of the force acquired by the one pound body \nduring its four meter fall will be equal to the force acquired by the\nfour pound body during its one meter fall. \n\n\nThird, Leibniz is further able to argue that the quantity of vis \nviva rather than the quantity of motion is conserved. To see \nthis, suppose that a one pound brick, having been raised to a height \nof four meters, falls on the end of a teeter-totter imparting a \nmotion to a four pound brick on the other end. Now if the amount of \nactive force is conserved \u2013 if there is as much force in the \neffect as in the cause \u2013 then (by the first premise) the brick \nshould be raised to a height of one meter. That being the case, \nhowever, it is clear from the preceding demonstrations that the \nquantity of vis viva but not the quantity of motion will be \nconserved (since the quantity of motion has decreased from 4 units to\n2 units).[17]\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the fourth premise plays a crucial role \nnot only in Leibniz\u2019s proof, but also in the larger picture of what \nhe takes his proof to show. Early in his career, Leibniz took the \nprinciple of the equality of cause and effect to be a necessary \n truth.[18]\n Later, however, he came to hold that it is only hypothetically or \nmorally necessary \u2013 a contingent feature that must nonetheless \nbe found in the best of all possible worlds (see, for example, G IV \n281/L272). From the status of the principle of equality of cause and \neffect, Leibniz in turn drew two important conclusions, one \nmetaphysical, one methodological. With respect to metaphysics, he \ntook the contingent status of the principle of equality of cause and \neffect to be evidence that the laws of motion and force are \nthemselves contingent, and thus he argued that the elegance of the \nlaws of nature provides evidence of God\u2019s benevolent design of the \nuniverse. With respect to methodology, he took the derivation of the \nconservation of vis viva as confirmation of the utility \n\u2013 indeed the practical necessity \u2013 of considerations of \ndivine teleology in making scientific discoveries even in the domain \nof physics. \n3.2 Physics and active forces\n\n\nIn his important summary of his dynamics \u2013 generally known by \nits Latin title \u201cSpecimen Dynamicum\u201d \u2013 \nLeibniz distinguishes between two kinds of active force. The first, \nand most important, is of course vis viva itself. In the \ncontext of his physics, vis viva, or \u201cliving \nforce,\u201d represents for Leibniz a measure of a body\u2019s ability to\nbring about effects in virtue of its motion. It is an active force \nwhich allows a moving body to, say, raise itself up to a given height\nor impart a motion to a slower body. (Intuitively, we might think of \nit as the \u201cforce\u201d that a bowling ball, for example, has \nin virtue of its falling from some height, or the power a baseball \nhas once released from a pitcher\u2019s hand.) As noted above, Leibniz \nmaintains that vis viva is conserved both locally in \nparticular cases of impact, and globally in the created world taken \nas a whole. The living force a body expends in raising itself to a \ngiven height must therefore be equal to the living force it gains by \nfalling from that height; the vis viva a body is able to \ntransfer to another body through impact must be equal to the \nmeasurement of vis viva it loses during that \n impact.[19]\n\n\n\nThe fact that collisions between actual bodies are never perfectly \nelastic represents a prima facie objection to the \nconservation of vis viva. Although the law looks tolerably \naccurate if we consider the collision of, say, two billiard balls, or\ntwo steel spheres, it seems woefully off if we consider, say, the \ncollision of two lumps of clay, or two scoops of ice cream. Indeed, \nin non-elastic collisions it appears that much \u2013 even all \n\u2013 of the active force of the colliding bodies as measured by \nmv2 may be lost. In addressing this \nfairly obvious worry, Leibniz returns to the idea that any body \n\u2013 no matter how small \u2013 must be composed of infinitely \nmany smaller bodies. He then argues that the apparent loss of vis\nviva in cases of inelastic collision is to be attributed to the \nfact that living force has been transferred to the smaller parts of \nthe gross bodies in a way that does not contribute fully to the \nmotion of the whole. It is thus lost in the sense that it does not \ncontribute to the motion of the larger bodies, but it is nonetheless \nconserved in the deeper sense that it is still present in the motion \nof the smaller bodies from which the larger bodies are constituted. \nLeibniz therefore insists, \u201cwhen the parts of the bodies absorb\nthe force of the impact, as a whole, as when two pieces of rich earth\nor clay come into collision \u2026 when, I say, some force is \nabsorbed by the parts, it is as good as lost \u2026 But this loss \n\u2026 does not detract from the inviolable truth of the law of the\nconservation of the same force in the world. For that which is \nabsorbed by the minute parts is not absolutely lost for the universe,\nalthough it is lost for the total force of the concurrent \nbodies\u201d (GM VI.230/Langley 670).\n\n\nIn his Specimen, Leibniz terms his second postulated active \nforce \u201cvis mortua\u201d or \u201cdead force,\u201d \nalthough it also appears in connection with the titles, \n\u201csolicitation,\u201d \u201cconatus,\u201d and \n\u201cimpetus.\u201d In spite of their correlative labels, the \nnotion of dead force appears to be less carefully worked out by \nLeibniz than the notion of living force. In the Specimen he \ntells us:\n\n\nOne force is elementary which I also call dead force, since \nmotion does not yet exist in it, but only a solicitation to motion, \nas with \u2026 a stone in a sling while it is still being held by a\nrope\u2026. An example of dead force is centrifugal force itself, \nand also the force of heaviness or centripetal force, and the force \nby which a stretched elastic body begins to restore itself. But when \nwe are dealing with impact, which arises from a heavy body which has \nalready been falling for some time, or from a bow that has already \nbeen restoring its shape for some time, or from a similar cause, the \nforce in question is living force, which arises from an infinity of \ncontinual impressions of dead force. (GM VI.238f/AG 121f)\n\n\nFrom this passage and surrounding texts, we can glean three central \nideas Leibniz associates with the notion of dead force. First, just \nas we might think of vis viva as a measure of the force a \nmoving body has in virtue of its being in motion, so we might think \nof vis mortua as a measure of the force a body has to bring \nabout motion even while at rest, or at an instant. Second, living \nforce is related to dead force by an infinite summation; vis \nviva is, as it were, an infinite accumulation of individual \ninstances of vis \n mortua.[20]\n Third, dead force is thus more immediately related to the study of \nstatics than to the study of dynamics, and Leibniz repeatedly \nsuggests that Cartesians have indeed been misled into maintaining the\nconservation of quantity of motion by confusing the laws of statics \nwith the laws of dynamics.\n\n\nOn some ways of reading of Leibniz\u2019s texts, the measure of dead force\napproaches very closely the measure of force more clearly at work in \nNewton\u2019s \n Principia.[21]\n It is therefore worth noting that although he could hardly deny the \ntechnical achievement of Newton\u2019s masterpiece, Leibniz was \nnonetheless eager to distance his own thinking about force from that \nof his great rival\u2019s. In a polemical piece whose title has been \ntranslated as \u201cAgainst Barbaric Physics,\u201d Leibniz writes:\n\n\nIt is, unfortunately, our destiny that, because of a certain aversion\ntoward light, people love to be returned to darkness\u2026. That \nphysics which explains everything in the nature of body through \nnumber, measure, weight, or size, shape and motion, and so teaches \nthat, in physics, everything happens mechanically, that is, \nintelligibly, this physics seems excessively clear and easy\u2026.\nIt is permissible to recognize magnetic, elastic, and other sorts of \nforces, but only insofar as we understand that they are not primitive\nor incapable of being explained, but arise from motions and shapes. \nHowever, the new patrons of such things don\u2019t want this. And it\nhas been observed that in our own times there was a real suggestion \nof this view among certain of our predecessors who established that \nthe planets gravitate and tend toward one another. It pleased them to\nmake the immediate inference that all matter essentially has a \nGod-given and inherent attractive power and, as it were, mutual love,\nas if matter had senses, or as if a certain intelligence were given \nto each part of matter by whose means each part could perceive and \ndesire even the most remote thing. (G VII.337\u2013339/AG 312=313; see \nalso Leibniz\u2019s fourth paper to Clarke, paragraph 45/Alexander 43) \n\n\nThe grounds for Leibniz\u2019s negative reaction to Newton\u2019s conception of\nforce, and specifically Newton\u2019s apparent postulation of a universal force\nof gravitation, are various and complex. One especially important \ntheme, however, indicated in the passage above, concerns what \nconception of force should be allowed to operate in the study of \nphysics. On the negative side, Leibniz thought that by postulating \nwhat he understood to be an irreducible force holding between bodies \nand acting at a distance, Newton had abandoned the intelligible \nexplanations of the mechanical philosophy, and returned to \nuninformative scholastic accounts that rested content with the \npostulation of primitive powers. On the positive side, Leibniz \nthought that by treating forces as inherent powers of bodies tied \ninextricably to their ability to move and be moved, his own \nconception of force could preserve the intelligibility that was the \ngreat hallmark of mechanism, while nonetheless improving upon the \nwork of those such as Huygens, Descartes and Galileo. For, by \nLeibniz\u2019s lights, the active and passive forces he postulates not \nonly render physics itself more accurate and consonant with reason \nbut at the same time set the stage for its intelligible grounding in \nhis own deeper metaphysics. In this way, Leibniz\u2019s understanding of \ndynamics becomes inextricably bound up with his more thoroughly \nmetaphysical views to which we must now briefly turn. \n3.3 Forces and Metaphysics\n\n\nIf the most important distinction of the Specimen Dynamicum \nwith respect to physics is between active and passive forces, its \nmost important distinction with respect to metaphysics is between \nwhat Leibniz calls \u201cprimitive\u201d and \n\u201cderivative\u201d forces. He holds that while derivative \nforces are of primary interest to the working physicist, they are \nmetaphysically secondary to primitive forces, and he speaks of the \nformer as being \u201cmodifications\u201d or \n\u201climitations\u201d of the latter (GM VI.236/AG 119). Although \nthe topic of the relationship between derivative and primitive forces\nquickly takes us away from Leibniz\u2019s treatment of physics and into \nthe heart of his metaphysics, it should be worthwhile to at least \ncall attention to this interface where what we are inclined to think \nof as Leibniz\u2019s physics so clearly bumps up against \u2013 indeed \noverlaps with \u2013 what we are inclined to think of as his \nmetaphysics. \n\n\nIt is widely accepted that Leibniz\u2019s primitive forces are supposed to\nserve as the intelligible metaphysical grounds for the forces that are\nof concern in physics, and more specifically that active derivative\nforces are to be grounded in active primitive forces while passive\nderivative forces are to be grounded in passive primitive\nforces. Furthermore, there is no denying that Leibniz sees his\ndistinction between active and passive primitive forces as being in\nsome way analogous to the distinction between Aristotelian form and\nmatter. Thus in the Specimen, he tells us that\n\u201cprimitive [active] force (which is nothing but the first\nentelechy) corresponds to the soul or substantial form [of\nthe scholastics]\u201d while \u201cthe primitive force of being\nacted upon or of resisting constitutes that which is\ncalled primary matter in the schools\u201d (GM VI.236\u2013237/AG\n119\u2013120). What has remained less certain is the answer to the\nquestion, \u201cWhere, as it were, does Leibniz think active and\npassive primitive forces are located?\u201d \n\n\nAnswering this question is complicated by Leibniz\u2019s embrace of \nthe seemingly fantastic thesis that the gross bodies studied in \nphysics are to be understood as being composed of infinitely many \norganisms: \n\n\nI am very far removed from the belief that animate bodies are only a \nsmall part of the others. For I believe rather that everything is \nfull of animate bodies \u2026 and that since matter is endlessly \ndivisible, one cannot fix on a part so small that there are no \nanimate bodies within, or at least bodies endowed with a basic \nentelechy or \u2026 with a vital principle, that is to say \ncorporeal substances, about which it may be said in general of them \nall that they are living. (G II.118/Garber 1998, 294)\n\n\nThus, according to Leibniz, the block of wood that is pushed up an \ninclined plane, or the ball dropped from a leaning tower must be \ncomposed of infinitely many organisms, with each of those organisms \nbeing composed of further organisms, etc. These organisms therefore \nmust in some way be counted as more ontologically basic than the \ngross bodies which they compose. \n\n\nDrawing on his commitment to panorganicism, his talk of corporeal \nsubstances, and his explicit invocation of the Aristotelian notions \nof form and matter, it has been suggested that in his middle years \nLeibniz held to an essentially Aristotelian ontology according to \nwhich the fundamental level of reality is occupied by organisms \ncomposed of substantial forms and matter. As Daniel Garber \u2013 \nthe reading\u2019s most influential defender \u2013 puts the view, it is \n\u201ca world whose principal inhabitants are corporeal substances \nunderstood on an Aristotelian model as unities of form and matter, \norganisms of a rudimentary sort, big bugs which contain smaller bugs,\nwhich contain smaller bugs still, all the way down\u201d (1985, 29). \nAccording to this picture, the derivative forces studied by \nphysicists are grounded in the active and passive natures of the\norganisms from which they are composed. Organisms strive and are \nacted upon at the most basic level of ontology, and those strivings \nand passions serve as the ground for the active and passive \nderivative forces examined, for example, in collisions between \nelastic spheres. Although Leibniz\u2019s panorganicism remains striking, \nthis picture promises a relatively straightforward account of the foundations of \nLeibniz\u2019s physics, and squares tolerably well with many of his texts,\nespecially from his middle years. \n\n\nThe \u201cbugs all the way down\u201d model is not, however, the\nonly model of fundamental metaphysics that one can find in Leibniz\u2019s\nwritings. In his most mature works, Leibniz suggests that at the\ndeepest level of ontology, we find only simple, mind-like\nsubstances, or \u201cmonads.\u201d Although strictly indivisible,\nLeibniz insists that monads can nonetheless be thought of as unities\nof form, insofar as they are active, and matter, insofar as they are\npassive. According to this metaphysics, the gross bodies studied by\nphysicists are at least twice removed from monadic reality. Gross\nbodies are grounded in organisms, or \u201ccorporeal\nsubstances,\u201d while corporeal substances are themselves grounded\nin simple substances, or \u201cmonads.\u201d This same chain of\nontological dependence, however, likewise holds for forces: the active\nforces attributed to gross bodies are \u201cwell-founded\u201d in\nthe active forces attributable to organisms, which are\n\u201cwell-founded\u201d in the active forces of monads, just as the\npassive forces attributable to gross bodies are\n\u201cwell-founded\u201d in the passive forces attributable to\norganisms, which in turn are \u201cwell-founded\u201d in the passive\nforces of monads. A full understanding of these grounding relations\nwould of course require a more detailed explication of the relations\nbetween monads, corporeal substances, and gross bodies, as well as a\nfuller account of what\u201cgrounding\u201d amounts to in this\ncontext. Nonetheless, even this rough sketch should suffice to\nindicate the broad outlines of Leibniz\u2019s commitment to founding the\nactive and passive forces he postulates as part of his physics in the\nmost fundamental level of reality which he postulates as part of his\nmost mature metaphysics. \n4. Leibniz on the Laws of Motion\n\n\nThe laws of motion held a privileged place in the mechanical \nphilosophy of the early modern period. Together with bodies they \nserved as the chief explanatory postulates of the new physics. It is \nthus not surprising that Leibniz held strong views concerning the \njustification of the laws of motion, the content of those laws, and \ntheir implications for the epistemology and metaphysics of motion. In\nthinking about Leibniz\u2019s positive views on the laws of motion, it \nmight prove once again helpful to first look at his reasons for being\ndissatisfied with the account offered by Descartes. \n4.1 Refuting Cartesian Laws of Motion\n\n\nIn addition to maintaining that the quantity of motion in the world \nis conserved, Descartes held that material bodies are governed by \nthree laws of motion and seven rules of impact (AT VIIIA 62\u201371/CSM \n 1:240\u2013245).[22]\n The first two laws in the Principles concern the movements \nof bodies in isolation, and taken together constitute Descartes\u2019s \nformulation of the principle of inertia. The third law in the \nPrinciples regulates the behavior of bodies colliding under \nidealized conditions: \n\n\nWhen a moving body comes upon another, if it has less force for \nproceeding in a straight line than the other has to resist it, then \nit is deflected in another direction, and retaining its motion, \nchanges only its determination. But if it has more, then it moves the\nother body with it, and gives the other as much of its motion as it \nitself loses. (AT VIIA.65/CSM 1:242)\n\n\nSignificantly, the third law thus distinguishes between two kinds of \ncases that Descartes believes to be importantly different. The first \nkind of case occurs when a moving body with a given power for \nproceeding collides with another body that has a greater power for \nresisting. Descartes maintains that in such situations the moving \nbody\u2019s direction or determination is altered, but that nonetheless \nthe quantity of motion for each of the colliding bodies remains the \nsame. The second kind of case occurs when a moving body with a given \npower for proceeding collides with another body that has a lesser \npower for resisting. Descartes maintains that in such situations, the\nmoving body\u2019s determination remains the same, and that the moving \nbody carries the resisting body along with it in such a way that \ntheir shared total quantity of motion remains the same. The seven \nrules further spell out the implications Descartes takes his laws of \nmotion to have for more specific cases of impact. \n\n\nAlthough Descartes\u2019s laws of motion go beyond his conservation law in\nplacing further constraints on the directions of bodies, they \nnonetheless presuppose that the total quantity of motion of bodies \nremains the same. Leibniz is therefore able to argue that Descartes\u2019s\nlaws of motion are untenable because they would lead to violations of\nthe conservation of force as measured by mv2. \nThus, in a letter to Bayle of 1687, Leibniz introduces, as an \nexample, a case where a ball B moving with 100 degrees of \nspeed collides head on with a ball C moving with 1 degree of\nspeed. Before the collision the two balls collectively have 101 units\nof quantity of motion as measure by ms, and 10,001 units of \nvis viva as measured by mv2. \nAccording to Descartes\u2019s Third Rule, after the collision the two \nballs should move together in the direction of B with a \nspeed of 50 \u00bd units. Their quantity of motion will be 101 \nunits as dictated by Descartes\u2019s conservation law, but their quantity\nof vis viva will be 2(50 \u00bd)2 or \n5100 \u00bd units. Leibniz thus objects that Descartes\u2019s laws of \nmotion would violate the conservation of vis viva \nand with it the principle that the whole cause must be equal to the \nentire effect (G III.46).\n\n\nIn addition to attacking Descartes\u2019s laws of motion on the basis of \nthe principle of the equality of cause and effect, Leibniz also \nmaintains that they would violate another \u201cmetaphysical\u201d \nprinciple, namely, the principle of continuity according to \nwhich continuous changes in inputs should lead to continuous changes \nin \n outputs.[23]\n Thus, for example, in a letter to Malebranche of July 1687, Leibniz \nwrites:\n\n\nI shall not repeat here what I have said before about the other \nsource of [Descartes\u2019s] errors, in taking the quantity of motion for \nthe force. But his first and second rules, for example, do not agree \nwith each other. The second says that if two bodies B and \nC collide in a straight line and with equal velocities, but \nB is but the least amount greater than C, \nC will be reflected with its former velocity, but B\nwill continue its motion. But according to his first rule, if \nB and C are equal and collide in a straight line, \nboth will be reflected and return at a velocity equal to that of \ntheir approach. This difference in the outcome in these two cases is \nunreasonable, however, for the inequality of the two bodies can be \nmade as small as you wish, and the difference between the assumptions\nin the two cases, that is, the difference between such inequality and\na perfect equality, becomes less than any difference; therefore \naccording to our principle, the difference between the effects or \nconsequences ought also to become less than any given difference. (G \nIII.53/L 352)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s argument here is that as the sizes of the bodies B\nand C change continuously from inequality to equality the \neffects of that change should be continuous as well. Descartes\u2019s \nrules of impact, however, would have an infinitesimal change in input\n\u2013 a change from B\u2019s being infinitesimally bigger than \nC, to C\u2019s being equal in size to B \u2013\nresult in a leap of output \u2013 from C rebounding while \nB remains stationary, to both B and C \nrebounding. Leibniz maintains that Descartes\u2019s rules of impact must \ntherefore be false since they violate the principle of continuity. \n\n\nIt is worth noting that, for Leibniz, the significance of the \nprinciple of continuity runs deeper than providing yet another reason\nfor thinking that the Cartesian laws of motion are \n flawed.[24]\n For him the principle of continuity is a contingent principle of \norder grounded not in brute necessity, but in divine benevolence \n\u2013 a discontinuous world would not be impossible, but merely \nsub-optimal. As such, Leibniz takes it to yield further support for \nthe metaphysical and methodological points noted above in connection \nwith his \u201cproof\u201d of the conservation of vis \nviva. Metaphysically, Leibniz takes the principle of continuity \nto support the claim that the true laws of motion are contingent \nsince they follow not from God\u2019s immutable nature or eternal truths, \nbut rather from God\u2019s wisdom and benevolence. Methodologically, he \ntakes it to support once again his view that the most promising route\nto the discovery of nature\u2019s secrets is neither blind empiricism, nor\ndeductive rationalism, but a combination of observation, pure reason,\nand reflection on the constraints imposed by considerations of the \nbest.\n4.2 A system of conservation principles\n\n\nFrom the perspective of kinematics, there is little new in Leibniz\u2019s\npositive account of the laws of motion. As we have seen, Leibniz\u2019s\nearliest systematic physics sought to accommodate the laws of impact\nas developed by Huygens and Wren by showing how those results might be\nderived from more fundamental laws of motion and the structure of the\nactual world. In his later work, that strategy is replaced by the\nattempt to show how essentially those same (\u201cconcrete\u201d)\nlaws of motion may be derived from a set of three conservation\nlaws. Although Leibniz\u2019s contribution to the kinematics of motion and\nimpact was thus not revolutionary, he nonetheless had the good sense\nto champion the best accounts going, and made them his own through his\nelegant derivations and by relating them to the broader themes of his\ndynamics and metaphysics. \n\n\nOne of the conservation laws that Leibniz takes to govern the \nbehavior of material bodies is what he calls the conservation of \nrelative velocity (GM VI.227/Langley 667). According to this \nprinciple, two perfectly elastic bodies will maintain the same \nrelative velocity with respect to their common center of gravity \nbefore and after \n collision.[25]\n That is, letting A and B represent two elastic \nballs involved in a head on collision: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\Velocity\\ A_{\\before} &- \\Velocity\\ B_{\\before} = \\\\\n & \\Velocity\\ B_{\\after} - \\Velocity\\ A_{\\after}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nor more simply:\n\n\\[\nV_{A\\ \\before} - V_{B\\ \\before} = V_{B\\ \\after} - V_{A\\ \\after}\n\\]\n\n\n\nLeibniz suggests that the conservation of relative velocity is rooted\nin the conservation of the ability of the two colliding bodies to \nperform work on one another. The guiding idea here seems to be that \nthe ability of, say, the balls A and B to act on \none another in virtue of their relative motion, should not be lost at\nall (at least in idealized cases), so that after a collision they \nshould continue to have the same ability to act on one another as \nthey had before they collided, and thus that they should have the \nsame relative velocity after the collision as they had \n before.[26]\n\n\n\nA second conservation law Leibniz calls the conservation of \nquantity of progress. According to it, two bodies will maintain \nthe same relative progress \u2013 where progress is measured by the \nquantity of mass (molem) times velocity \u2013 before and \nafter collision (GM VI.227/Langley 667). Thus, letting A and\nB once again represent two balls involved in a head on \ncollision:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\Mass\\ A\\times V_{A\\ \\before}) &+ (\\Mass\\ B\\times V_{B\\ \\before}) = \\\\\n &(\\Mass\\ B\\times V_{B\\ \\after}) + (\\Mass\\ A\\times V_{A\\ \\after}) \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nor more simply:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nM_A \\times V_{A\\ \\before} &+ M_B \\times V_{B\\ \\before} =  \\\\\n &M_B \\times V_{B\\ \\after} + M_A \\times V_{A\\ \\after}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s conservation of progress is closely related to the \nCartesian law of conservation of quantity of motion (and the more \nfamiliar law of the conservation of momentum). As Leibniz is at pains\nto emphasize, however, his law differs from the Cartesian law at \nleast in that it traffics in \u201csigned\u201d velocities rather \nthan scalar speeds. Leibniz is thus able to maintain that although \n\u201cit will be found that the total progress is conserved, or that\nthere is as much progress in the same direction before or after the \nimpact\u201d nonetheless the quantity of motion, as measured simply \nby speed times mass is not conserved (GM VI.217/Langley 658). \n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s third law applies the conservation of vis\nviva to cases of impact. It therefore maintains that the \n\u201cmotive\u201d or \u201cliving\u201d force, as measured by \nmass times velocity squared for a pair of bodies is the same before \nand after collision (GM VI.227/Langley 667\u2013668): \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n M_A \\times (V_{A\\ \\before})^2 &+ M_B \\times (V_{B\\ \\before})^2 = \\\\\n &M_B \\times (V_{B\\ \\after})^2 + M_A \\times (V_{A\\ \\after})^2\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nUnlike the quantity of progress, but like relative velocity, the \nquantity of vis viva appears to be conserved only \nin elastic collisions. At the macro-level, when a lump of soft clay \nstrikes another lump of soft clay, their momentum is conserved but \nkinetic energy is lost. As noted above, rather than abandon the \nuniversality of his third law, Leibniz suggests instead that energy \nis conserved but redistributed to the minute parts of which the clay \nis composed. In this way, he tells us \u201cthat which is absorbed \nby the minute parts is not absolutely lost for the universe, although\nit is lost for the total force of the concurrent bodies\u201d (GM \nVI.231/Langley 670). \n\n\nIn his Essay on Dynamics, Leibniz shows how from any two of \nhis conservation laws the third law may be derived. This might \nsuggest that Leibniz sees all three as being on a par with one \nanother. In fact, however, he insists that the conservation of \nvis viva is more fundamental than the conservation \nof relative velocity or common progress. His reasons for privileging \nmv2 in this way are far from clear, but he must \nhave recognized them to be necessarily metaphysical. Although the \nmeasurement of mv2 is relative to a choice of \nreference frame, Leibniz probably thought that it had a better claim \nto tracking an intrinsic property of bodies in light of the \nconsiderations he raises in his Brief Demonstration. For \nLeibniz, vis viva is a force attributable to particular \nbodies in virtue of which they are able to perform work on other \nbodies \u2013 or as in the case of a pendulum \u2013 on themselves; he \nthus held the conservation of vis viva to be the most \nfundamental, overarching conservation law for the physical world. \n4.3 Absolute or relative motion?\n\n\nAs far as kinematics is concerned, Leibniz, like most of his \ncontemporaries, accepted the observational under-determination of \nconstant linear motion. That is to say, he granted that \u2013 if we\nbracket considerations of force \u2013 there\u2019s no saying which of \ntwo bodies moving relative to each other with a constant velocity is \nreally moving. So, for example, Leibniz would have conceded \nthat we can\u2019t tell just by looking whether Train A or \nTrain B is really moving, even if they are moving \nwith a constant velocity relative to one another. This observational \nunder-determination or \u201cinvariance\u201d \u2013 often called \nGalilean invariance \u2013 is still accepted today, \nalthough the natural assumption that it makes sense to speak of any \nbody as \u201creally\u201d moving with a constant velocity \nindependently of an arbitrarily chosen frame of reference is not. \n\n\nContinuing to restrict ourselves to kinematics, Leibniz appears to \nembrace something even stronger than Galilean invariance. He suggests\nthat not only is constant linear motion observationally \nunderdetermined, but furthermore that \u201cIf we consider change in\nposition alone, or that which is merely mathematical in \nmotion,\u201d then all motion is observationally \nunderdetermined (A VI.iv.2017/Lodge 2003, 278). That is to say, he \nseems to accept that not even accelerations \u2013 changes in \ndirection or speed \u2013 can be detected by empirical observation. \nThus, for example, he writes:\n\n\nThe law of nature concerning the equivalence of hypotheses that we \nestablished earlier, namely, that a hypothesis which once corresponds\nto the present phenomena will always correspond to the subsequent \nphenomena in that way, is not only true for rectilinear motion but \nmore generally, however the bodies act on one another, just as long \nas the system of bodies is isolated from others, or no external agent\ncomes along. (GM VI.507/Lodge 2003, 280) \n\n\nEven if we grant that we cannot tell whether it is our train that is \ngliding along with a constant velocity or the train that we see \nthrough the window, we might nonetheless maintain that we can tell \n\u2013 by, say, the sudden jerk we feel \u2013 if our train has \njust accelerated by increasing its speed, or \u2013 because we feel \nourselves pushed against the wall \u2013 that it is rounding a sharp\ncorner. Leibniz, however, seems to deny \n this,[27]\n insisting instead that \u201cno eye, wherever in matter it might be \nplaced, has a sure criterion for telling from the phenomena where \nthere is motion, how much motion there is and of what sort it is, \nor even whether God moves everything around it, or whether he \nmoves that very eye itself\u201d (AG \n 91).[28]\n\n\n\nFrom the observational under-determination of all motion considered \nkinematically, Leibniz infers that if there were nothing more to \nmotion than change of position relative to other bodies, then there \nwould be no real or genuine motion in the world at \n all.[29]\n He is thus committed to maintaining that if there were nothing more \nto motion than relative change of position, then, since motion could \nbe ascribed with equal right to, say, Train A or Train \nB, then there would be no fact of the matter as to whether \nTrain A or Train B is moving, and thus it would \nmake no sense to say that either Train A or Train B\nis moving. The suggestion that motion be treated as irreducibly \nrelational \u2013 so that motion could be ascribed to Train \nA relative to one reference frame, and to Train B \nrelative to another reference frame \u2013 would have had no \nattraction for Leibniz, who consistently denied that there are any \ngenuine external relations (i.e. relations that do not wholly \nsupervene on intrinsic properties). \n\n\nAccepting the observational under-determination of motion understood \nas mere change of relative position, and finding absurd the \nconsequence that there is no genuine motion in the world, Leibniz \ndenies the premise that there is nothing more to motion than relative\nchange of position. He thus maintains that rather than grant that \nthere is no real motion, \u201cin order to say that something is \nmoving, we will require not only that it change its position with \nrespect to other things but also that there be within itself a cause \nof change, a force, an action\u201d (G IV.396/L 393). Intuitively, \nLeibniz\u2019s suggestion is that genuine motion requires, in addition to \nrelative change of place, a cause of that relative change. To return \nto our earlier example, if Train A moves relative to Train \nB, we should say, according to Leibniz, that Train \nA really moves if and only if, it is the active cause of \ntheir relative motion. Since, for Leibniz, being an active cause, or \nlocus of force, is a non-relativistic property attributable to \nindividual bodies, it is in principle capable of breaking the \n\u201cequivalence of hypotheses\u201d and thus grounding true or \ngenuine motion. \n\n\nWhile force, however, thus provides the necessary metaphysical \ngrounds for the existence of genuine motions, it does not, at least \nas far as the physicist is concerned, solve the empirical issue of \nwhich bodies can be ascribed genuine motion (Garber 1995, 307; but \nsee also Lodge 2003). For, as we have seen, the ascription of force \n\u2013 of vis viva or mv2 \n\u2013 is itself empirically relative to a frame of reference. The \npostulation of force makes genuine motion possible; it does not tell \nus which bodies are genuinely in motion and which are moved merely \nrelatively. In practice Leibniz thus counsels that \u2013 as in \nastronomy \u2013 \u201cone can hold the simplest hypothesis \n(everything considered) as the true one\u201d (GM II 184/AG 308). \nAlthough the metaphysician can rest assured that true motion must be \nabsolute, the physicist must therefore be content to work with \nrelative motions and simplifying assumptions. \n5. Leibniz on Space and Time\n\n\nIn his Principia, Newton had suggested that the absolute\nmotion of bodies is to be defined relative to absolute space and time,\nand to be discovered by its properties, causes and\n effects.[30]\n Leibniz, as we have just seen, opposed such a view, holding instead\nthat true motions are to be defined with respect to the active forces\nthat he took to be inherent in truly moving bodies. This disagreement\nbetween Newton and Leibniz over the nature of true motion surfaced\nmore explicitly in their disagreement over the nature of space and\ntime in the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence. In the five letters he\nmanaged to write before his death, Leibniz succeeded in articulating\nnot only his reasons for opposing what he took to be Newton\u2019s\nconception of absolute space and time, but also sketching an\nalternative picture according to which they are to be understood as\nabstract systems of relations. \n5.1 Against Absolute Space and Time\n\n\nIn his correspondence with Leibniz, Clarke defends what has become \nknown as an absolute theory of space and time. The version championed\nby Clarke on Newton\u2019s behalf might briefly be characterized for our \npurposes as having four central theses. First, space and time are \nlogically and metaphysically prior to physical bodies and events. \nThat is to say, although space and time could exist even if there \nwere no physical bodies or events, the existence of things like \nplanets and flashes could not exist without space and time. Second, \nphysical bodies and events exist within space and time \n\u2013 the beach ball is collocated with a region of space equal to \nits volume; the explosion endures through a determinate measure of \nabsolute time. Third, although we may distinguish regions, or \n\u201cparts,\u201d of space and time, neither space nor time \nstrictly speaking are divisible since no region of space or time \ncould be separated, or \u201cpulled apart,\u201d from any other \nregion. Fourth, ontologically speaking, space and time may be \nidentified with attributes of God: infinite space just is the \nattribute of God\u2019s Immensity, while infinite time just is \nthe attribute of God\u2019s Eternity. \n\n\nLeibniz introduces three main lines of attack against the \nClarke-Newton conception of absolute space and time. The first line \nfocuses on the suggestion that space and time might be identified \nwith the divine attributes, and on Newton\u2019s claim \u2013 made in his\n Optics[31]\n \u2013 that space is, as it were, the sensorium of God. \nLeibniz, at root, argues that such claims are deeply misleading at \nbest, heretical at worst. Thus, for example, against the suggestion \nthat space might be identified with God\u2019s Immensity, he \nwrites to Clarke, \u201cif space is a property of God \u2026 space\nbelongs to the essence of God. But space has parts: therefore there \nwould be parts in the essence of God\u201d (Fifth Paper, paragraph \n43; G VII.399/Alexander 68). Likewise, he argues that if time were \nidentified with God\u2019s Immensity, then we would have to say \nthat since things are in time, they are in God\u2019s Immensity, \nand thus in God\u2019s essence, \u201cStrange expressions; which plainly \nshow, that the author [i.e. Clarke] makes a wrong use of terms\u201d\n(Fifth Paper, paragraph 44; G VII.399/Alexander \n 68).[32]\n Finally, from his first letter on, Leibniz seizes on what he takes to\nbe the impious implication of Newton\u2019s suggestion that space might in\nsome sense be considered the seat of divine perception or cognition, \nwriting, \u201cSir Isaac Newton says, that space is an organ, which \nGod makes use of to perceive things by. But if God stands in need of \nany organ to perceive things by, it will follow, that they do not \ndepend altogether upon him, nor were produced by him\u201d (First \nPaper, paragraph 3; G VII.352/Alexander 11). \n\n\nA second, more philosophical, line of attack pivots on Leibniz\u2019s \ncommitment to the Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR). In \nthe present context we can understand the PSR as demanding that there be \nsome reason for God\u2019s creating the world in one way rather than \nanother since \u201cA mere will without any motive, is a fiction, \nnot only contrary to God\u2019s perfection, but also chimerical and \ncontradictory\u201d (Fourth Paper, paragraph 2; G \nVII.371\u20132/Alexander 36). Leibniz argues that if the PSR is granted, \nthe apparent possibility of absolute space and time can be \nundermined. For, on the supposition that God creates the world in an \ninfinite, homogenous, absolute space, there could be no reason for \nhis creating the world oriented in one way with respect to that space\nrather than another way \u2013 that is, there could be no reason to \nprefer the world situated in one way rather than, say, rotated in \nspace by ninety degrees. Since the supposition of absolute space thus\nleads to a violation of the PSR, the supposition itself must be \nrejected as chimerical or confused according to Leibniz. Similarly, \non the supposition that God creates the world in an infinite, \nhomogenous, absolute time, there could be no reason for God\u2019s \ncreating the world at one time rather than at another time. Again, \nsince the supposition leads to a violation of the PSR, Leibniz \nmaintains that the supposition itself must be rejected as chimerical \nor confused. \n\n\nA third line of attack offered by Leibniz against the Newtonian \nconception of space and time draws on another principle familiar from\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics, namely, the Principle of the Identity of \nIndiscernibles (PII). In the present context we may understand \nthe PII as ruling out the possibility of two things being distinct, \nbut not distinct in virtue of some discernible property. It thus \nsuggests that where we cannot identify a recognizable difference \nbetween two things or possibilities, those two are in fact only one \n\u2013 that is, as Leibniz puts it, that \u201cTo suppose two \nthings indiscernible, is to suppose the same thing under two \nnames\u201d (Fourth Paper, paragraph 6; G VII.372/Alexander 37). \nArmed with the PII, Leibniz argues once again that the apparent \npossibility of absolute space and time can be undermined. For on the \nsupposition of absolute space, the world oriented in one way with \nrespect to space would have to be a distinct possibility from the \nworld oriented in another way with respect to absolute space. But, \naccording to Leibniz, two such purported possibilities would be \nindiscernible since no being \u2013 not even God or an angel \u2013\ncould recognize any difference between them. Leibniz thus concludes \nthat since the supposition of absolute space leads to a violation of \nthe PII, the supposition itself must be rejected. By essentially the \nsame reasoning, Leibniz argues similarly that the apparent \npossibility of absolute time is also inconsistent with the PII and so\ntoo must be rejected as chimerical or confused. \n5.2 Leibnizian Space and Time\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s positive account of space and time might be thought of as \nresting on two primary pillars and being filled out by a number of \nancillary theses. The first pillar consists in an alternative model, \nor conception, of space and time offered in conscious opposition to \nthe Newtonian conception absolute space and time. According to \nLeibniz, space and time are not so much things in which \nbodies are located and move as systems of relations holding \nbetween things. He thus famously tells Clarke in his Third Paper:\n\n\nAs for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space \nto be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an \norder of coexistences, as time is an order of successions. (Third \nPaper, paragraph 4; G VII.363/Alexander 25\u201326)\n\n\nThe main idea is perhaps illustrated more intuitively by a helpful \nexample that Leibniz introduces in his Fifth Paper. There he suggests\nthat space and time are analogous to a family tree. Unlike the \nrelationship between, say, a mighty oak and its leaves, a \ngenealogical tree is not something which exists as a thing \nindependently of, and prior to, its members, but is itself rather \nsomething like an abstract system of relations holding between \nbrothers, sisters, parents, children, aunts, uncles, etc. Analogously\nfor Leibniz, space and time are not to be thought of as containers in\nwhich bodies are literally located and through which they move, but \nrather as an abstract structure of relations in which actual (and \neven possible) bodies might be embedded. \n\n\nThe second pillar of Leibniz\u2019s positive account of space and time is \nrooted in his view that \u2013 even understood as systems of \nrelations \u2013 space and time as \u201cbeings of reason\u201d \nare in a sense at least two steps removed from the monads of his \nmature metaphysics. (i) Although bodies may be held to stand in \nspatial and temporal relations to one another, Leibniz claims, space \nand time themselves must be considered abstractions or idealizations \nwith respect to those relations. For while relations between bodies \nand events are necessarily variable and changing, the relations \nconstituting space and time must be viewed as determinate, fixed, and\nideal. (ii) As we have briefly noted, however, according to Leibniz\u2019s\nmost mature metaphysics, physical bodies and events are themselves to\nbe understood as merely well-founded phenomena. Relations of relative\ndistance and duration holding between bodies must therefore \nthemselves be a step removed from monadic reality, and thus space and\ntime must be, as it were, a second step removed from the most basic \nnon-relational entities of Leibniz\u2019s most mature metaphysics. In \nspite of this double relation holding between ideal space and time on\nthe one hand and monadic reality on the other, Leibniz nonetheless \ninsists that ideal space must be intelligibly related to the various \nperceptions by which monads represent the world, each from its own \n\u201cpoint of view,\u201d just as ideal time must be intelligibly \nrelated to the various appetites in accordance with which monads \nsequentially unfold in synchronized harmony. Although the details of \nthis intelligible grounding story remain less than perspicuous, there\ncan be no doubt that Leibniz saw his relationalism about space and \ntime as dovetailing with the foundations of his monadic metaphysics.\n\n\nBeyond arguing that space and time are ideal systems of relations, \nLeibniz also defends a number of less central theses that help to \nflesh out his positive conceptions of space and time. For our \npurposes it might be worth quickly calling attention to three of the \nmost significant. First, although he takes space and time to be ideal\nsystems of relations, Leibniz nonetheless insists that they are \nconceived of as infinite. In doing so he takes a characteristically \nintermediate position, partially siding with most early moderns in \nrejecting the notion of an imaginary space surrounding a finite \ncosmos, but also partially siding with earlier medieval thinkers in \naffirming that \u201cSince space is itself an ideal thing \u2026 \nspace out of the world must needs be imaginary [but] \u2026 The \ncase is the same with empty space within the world; which I also take\nto be imaginary\u201d (Fifth Paper, paragraph 33; G \nVII.396/Alexander \n 64).[33]\n Second, Leibniz maintains that although the existence of empty space \nis possible \u2013 logically speaking, two bodies could exist at a \nspatial distance with nothing between them \u2013 nonetheless it is \nmorally certain that the actual world is a plenum. For, as we have \nalready noted in connection with his critique of atomism, Leibniz \nmaintains the existence of empty space would be inconsistent with \nGod\u2019s decision to create the best of all possible worlds. Third, in \nspite of his critique of Newton, Leibniz affirms that space and time \nare continuous, homogenous, and infinitely divisible (although not \nactually divided to infinity). He holds that the ascription of such \nproperties to space and time is only possible once they are \nrecognized to be ideal, or \u201cimaginary,\u201d and in this way \nLeibnizian space and time are further distinguished not only from \nNewtonian absolute space and time, but also from extended Leibnizian \nbodies. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"SelPriTex\">Selected Primary Texts</a>", "<a name=\"SelPriTexTra\">Selected Primary Texts in Translation</a>", "<a name=\"SelGenStuCol\">Selected General Studies and Collections</a>", "<a name=\"LeiLifWor\">Leibniz\u2019s Life and Works</a>", "<a name=\"LeiEarPhy\">Leibniz\u2019s Early Physics</a>", "<a name=\"LeiMatBib\">Leibniz on Matter</a>", "<a name=\"LeiDynBib\">Leibniz\u2019s Dynamics</a>", "<a name=\"LeiLawMotBib\">Leibniz on The Laws of Motion</a>", "<a name=\"LeiSpaTimBib\">Leibniz on Space &amp; Time</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"SelPriTex\">Selected Primary Texts</a>": ["</h3>\n<table class=\"cellpad-small-dense vert-top cell-rl\">\n<tr>", "[A]", "German Academy of Sciences, ed., <em>Gottfried Wilhelm\nLeibniz: S\u00e4mtliche Schriften und Briefe</em>, Darmstadt and\nBerlin: Akademie Verlag, 1926\u2013.
