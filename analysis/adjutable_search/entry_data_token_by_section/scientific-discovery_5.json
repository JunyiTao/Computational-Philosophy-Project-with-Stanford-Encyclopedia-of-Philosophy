Logics of discovery after the context distinction\n\nOne way of responding to the demarcation criterion described above is\nto argue that discovery is a topic for philosophy of science because\nit is a logical process after all. Advocates of this approach to the\nlogic of discovery usually accept the overall distinction between the\ntwo processes of conceiving and testing a hypothesis. They also agree\nthat it is impossible to put together a manual that provides a formal,\nmechanical procedure through which innovative concepts or hypotheses\ncan be derived: There is no discovery machine. But they reject the\nview that the process of conceiving a theory is a creative act, a\nmysterious guess, a hunch, a more or less instantaneous and random\nprocess. Instead, they insist that both conceiving and testing\nhypotheses are processes of reasoning and systematic inference, that\nboth of these processes can be represented schematically, and that it\nis possible to distinguish better and worse paths to new\nknowledge.\n\nThis line of argument has much in common with the logics of discovery\ndescribed in\n section 4\n above but it is now explicitly pitched against the disciplinary\ndistinction tied to the context distinction. There are two main ways\nof developing this argument. The first is to conceive of discovery in\nterms of abductive reasoning\n (section 6.1).\n The second is to conceive of discovery in terms of problem-solving\nalgorithms, whereby heuristic rules aid the processing of available\ndata and enhance the success in finding solutions to problems\n (section 6.2).\n Both lines of argument rely on a broad conception of logic, whereby\nthe \u201clogic\u201d of discovery amounts to a schematic account of\nthe reasoning processes involved in knowledge generation.\n",
