    "main_text": "The Nature of Fiction || Fiction as Make-Believe\n1.4 Fiction as Make-Believe\n\nThe problems faced by pretense accounts of fiction that only consider\nwhat authors do have made some philosophers look instead at the role\nthat readers play. Indeed, approaches that look at the role of readers\n(or, more generally, consumers) of fiction have now become standard in\nthe literature. Kendall Walton\u2019s version of such a view appeared\nin his ground-breaking Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations\nof the Representational Arts (Walton 1990). Walton focuses on the\nway a text can be used as a resource in games of make-believe in which\nparticipants pretend, imagine, or make believe that the world is as\nthe text represents it as being. (Walton\u2019s view, it should be\nstressed, applies to representational entities in general: dolls,\nglobs of mud, paintings, sculptures, and so on, not just literary\ntexts.) Just as children use tree stumps as props in a game of\nmake-believe in which the stumps count as bears, so a community of\nreaders can use a text as a prop in a game of make-believe in which\nthe text is treated as a record of events, situations, conversations,\netc. Any text whose function is to serve as a prop in a game of\nmake-believe, thereby prescribing imaginings about its content, counts\nas a work of fiction for Walton. (Function is determined by a number\nof factors such as author\u2019s intentions and views about how the\nwork can be appropriately used; Walton 1990: 91.) If readers let their\nimaginings be directed in this way, they are then participating in a\ngame of make-believe that is authorized by the work.\n\nFor Walton, then, what is necessary for a text to count as a work of\nfiction is that it is supposed to serve as a prop in a game of\nmake-believe, one that requires readers of the text to make believe\nits content. Note that this does not exclude the author from having a\nsimilar attitude to the work. Authors too may imagine or make believe\nor pretend that what they are saying is true (cf. Searle), but what is\ncrucial to a work of fiction is that this is a requirement on\nconsumers of fiction. (For this reason, day-dreaming out loud\ndoes not count as fiction.) Walton argues that this make-believe view\nprevents most biographies, textbooks, newspaper articles, and the\nlike, from being works of fiction, since it is \n\n\nnot [their] function, as such, to serve as props in games of\nmake-believe. They are used to claim truth for certain propositions\nrather than to make propositions fictional. (1990: 70) \n\n\nBut there is a complication. Walton intends the account to provide a\nsufficient condition for being a work of fiction, not just a necessary\ncondition. In proposing this, he self-consciously departs from our\nordinary, intuitive concept of fiction, which he sees as only \u201ca\nrough everyday classification\u201d (Walton 1990: 72) in urgent need\nof refinement (among other problems, the ordinary concept of fiction\nis liable to treat certain works, for example, didactic dialogues like\nBerkeley\u2019s Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous\n(1713), as both non-fiction and fiction; Walton 1990: 72). But that\nmeans that his new way of construing the fiction/non-fiction\ndistinction does not align with the usual way of understanding it,\nsince many works of apparent non-fiction\u2014many newspaper\narticles, biographies, real-life adventure tales, and so on\u2014are\nwritten in a way that is designed to engage readers\u2019 imagination\nand so satisfy the conditions for being works of fiction. Thus, he\nwrites\n\n\nSome histories are written in such a vivid, novelistic style that they\nalmost inevitably induce the reader to imagine what is said,\nregardless of whether or not he believes it. (Indeed, this may be true\nof Prescott\u2019s History of the Conquest of Peru.) If we\nthink of the work as prescribing such a reaction, it serves as a prop\nin a game of make-believe. (Walton 1990: 71) \n\n\nSimilarly, there is \n\n\nno doubt that [Norman Mailer\u2019s The Executioner\u2019s\nSong\u2014a novelistic retelling of the execution of Gary\nGilmore] \u2026 has the function of prescribing imaginings (Walton\n1990: 80) \n\n\nand so counts as fiction for Walton. Walton even thinks that any\nmetaphor is a fiction since a metaphor prescribes imagining (Walton\n1993), and that objects that were not produced to function in this\nway, such as naturally produced cracks in a rock, could be treated as\nprops that prompt imaginings, and so could turn out to be a work of\nfiction (Walton 1990: 87).\n",
