    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life \nThis philosopher\u2019s family name was \u201cWang,\u201d his personal\nname was \u201cShouren,\u201d and his \u201ccourtesy name\u201d\nwas \n\u201cBo\u2013an.\u201d[1]\n However, he is normally known today as\n\u201cWang Yangming,\u201d based on a nickname he adopted when he\nwas living in the Yangming Grotto of Kuaiji Mountain.  Born in 1472\nnear Hangzhou in what is now Zhejiang Province, Wang was the son of a\nsuccessful official.  As such, he would have received a fairly\nconventional education, with a focus on the Four Books of the\nConfucian tradition: the Analects (the sayings of Confucius\nand his immediate disciples), the Great Learning (believed to\nconsist of an opening statement by Confucius with a commentary on it\nby his leading disciple, Zengzi), the Mean (attributed to\nZisi, the grandson of Confucius, who was also a student of Zengzi),\nand the Mengzi (the sayings and dialogues of Mencius, a\nstudent of Zisi).  The young Wang would have literally committed these\nclassics to memory, along with the commentaries on them by the master\nof orthodox Confucianism, Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200).  The study of\nthese classics\u2013cum\u2013commentary was thought to be morally\nedifying; however, people also studied them in order to pass the civil\nservice examinations, which were the primary route to government\npower, and with it wealth and prestige.  At the age of seventeen\n(1489), Wang had a conversation with a Daoist priest that left him\ndeeply intrigued with this alternative philosophical system and way of\nlife.  Wang was also attracted to Buddhism, and remained torn between\nDaoism, Buddhism and Confucianism for much of his early life.  Whereas\nConfucianism emphasizes our ethical obligations to others, especially\nfamily members, and public service in government, the Daoism and\nBuddhism of Wang\u2019s era encouraged people to overcome their attachment\nto the physical world.  Wang continued the serious study of Zhu Xi\u2019s\ninterpretation of Confucianism, but was disillusioned by an experience\nin which he and a friend made a determined effort to apply what they\ntook to be Zhu Xi\u2019s method for achieving sagehood:\n\n\u2026my friend Qian and I discussed the idea that to become a sage\nor a worthy one must investigate all the things in the world.  But how\ncan a person have such tremendous energy?  I therefore pointed to the\nbamboos in front of the pavilion and told him to investigate them and\nsee.  Day and night Qian went ahead trying to investigate to the\nutmost the Pattern of the bamboos.  He exhausted his mind and\nthoughts, and on the third day he was tired out and took sick.  At\nfirst I said that it was because his energy and strength were\ninsufficient.  Therefore I myself went to try to investigate to the\nutmost.  From morning till night, I was unable to find the Pattern of\nthe bamboos.  On the seventh day I also became sick because I thought\ntoo hard.  In consequence we sighed to each other and said that it was\nimpossible to be a sage or a worthy, for we do not have the tremendous\nenergy to investigate things that they have.  (Translation modified\nfrom Chan 1963, 249)\n\nAs we shall see (Section 2, below), it is unclear whether Wang and\nhis friend were correctly applying what Zhu Xi meant by \u201cthe\ninvestigation of things.\u201d However, Wang\u2019s experience of finding\nit impractical to seek for the Pattern of the universe in external\nthings left a deep impression on him, and influenced the later course\nof his philosophy.\nWang continued to study Daoism as well as Buddhism, but also showed\na keen interest in military techniques and the craft of writing\nelegant compositions.  Meanwhile, he progressed through the various\nlevels of the civil service examinations, finally passing the highest\nlevel in 1499.  After this, Wang had a meteoric rise in the\ngovernment, including distinguished service in offices overseeing\npublic works, criminal prosecution, and the examination system.\nDuring this period, Wang began to express disdain for overly refined\nliterary compositions like those he had produced in his earlier years.\nWang would later criticize those who \u201cwaste their time competing\nwith one another writing flowery compositions in order to win acclaim\nin their age, and\u2026no longer comprehend conduct that honors what\nis fundamental, esteems what is real, reverts to simplicity, and\nreturns to purity\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 275).\nIn addition, Wang started to turn his back on Daoism and Buddhism,\nwhich he came to regard as socially irresponsible:\n\u201c\u2026simply because they did not understand what it is to\nrest in the ultimate good and instead exerted their selfish minds\ntoward the achievement of excessively lofty goals, [Buddhists and\nDaoists] were lost in vagaries, illusions, emptiness, and stillness\nand had nothing to do with the family, state or world\u201d (Tiwald\nand Van Norden 2014, 244, gloss mine).  Nonetheless, Wang continued to\nshow an intimate familiarity with Daoist and Buddhist literature and\nconcepts throughout his career.\nA life\u2013changing event for Wang occurred in 1506.  A eunuch\nwho had assumed illegitimate influence at court had several able\nofficials imprisoned for opposing him.  Wang wrote a\n\u201cmemorial\u201d to the emperor in protest.  The eunuch\nresponded by having Wang publicly beaten and exiled to an\ninsignificant position in a semi\u2013civilized part of what is now\nGuizhou Province.  Wang had to face considerable physical and\npsychological hardship in this post, but through these challenges he\nachieved a deep philosophical awakening (1508), which he later\nexpressed in a poem he wrote for his students:\n\nEveryone has within an unerring compass; The root and source of\nthe myriad transformations lies in the mind. I laugh when I\nthink that, earlier, I saw things the other way around;\nFollowing branches and leaves, I searched outside! (Ivanhoe 2009, 181)\n\nIn other words, looking outside oneself for moral truth, as he and\nhis friend Qian had tried to do when studying the bamboos, was\nignoring the root of moral insight, which is one\u2019s own innate\nunderstanding.\nFortunately for Wang, in the year when his term of service in\nGuizhou was over (1510), the eunuch who had Wang beaten and banished\nwas himself executed.  Wang\u2019s official career quickly returned to its\nstratospheric level of achievement, with high\u2013ranking posts and\nexceptional achievements in both civil and military positions. This\ninevitably led to opposition from the faction\u2013ridden court. Wang\nwas even accused of conspiring with the leader of a rebellion that\nWang had himself put down. \nWang had begun to attract devoted disciples even before his exile\nto Guizhou, and they gradually compiled the Record for\nPractice (the anthology of his sayings, correspondence, and\ndialogues that is one of our primary sources for Wang\u2019s\nphilosophy). It is reflective of Wang\u2019s philosophy that the\ndiscussions recorded in this work occurred in the midst of his active\nlife in public affairs.  Near the end of his life, Wang was called\nupon to suppress yet another rebellion (1527).  The night before he\nleft, one of his disciples recorded the \u201cInquiry on the\nGreat Learning,\u201d which was intended as a primer of\nWang\u2019s philosophy for new disciples.  Wang put down the rebellion, but\nhis health had been declining for several years, and he died soon\nafterward (1529).\nOn his deathbed, Wang said, \u201c\u2009\u2018This mind\u2019\nis luminous and bright.
