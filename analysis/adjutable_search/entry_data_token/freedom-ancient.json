They asked questions about when\npeople are morally responsible for their actions and what must be the\ncase for people to deliberate and act effectively, and in doing so\nthey confronted arguments that tried to establish that humans are not\nresponsible and effective agents. But if we want to understand these\nphilosophers correctly, we should be careful not to assimilate ancient\ntheories of freedom and determinism too quickly to the problem of free\nwill and determinism in contemporary philosophy, which asks whether\ncausal determinism is compatible with the sort of freedom\u2014or\nalternatively, with the sort of control over our actions\u2014that is\nnecessary for moral responsibility. (See the entries on\n free will\n and\n causal determinism.)\n While ancient philosophers did argue about whether causal determinism\nis compatible with moral responsibility, their concerns ranged more\nwidely. We can divide their discussions into two broad areas.\n\nThe first is effective agency\u2014do humans have the\nability to act as they wish to, in order to get what they desire?\nAristotle thinks that effective deliberation and action presupposes\nthe openness or contingency of the future\u2014that what is going to\nhappen is not necessary. Aristotle confronts an argument that tries to\nestablish that the future is necessary, and hence that deliberation\nand action are futile. This argument, however, proceeds not from\ncausal determinism, but from what might be called \u201clogical\ndeterminism\u201d\u2014the thesis that, from eternity, statements\nabout the future have had fixed truth values. The Epicureans, Stoics,\nand academic skeptic Carneades confront the same argument, but they\nalso consider the relationship between \u201clogical\ndeterminism\u201d and causal determinism, and whether causal\ndeterminism is compatible with effective agency.\n\nThe second area is\nmoral responsibility, our ability to be justifiably subject\nto praise and reward, or blame and punishment for what we do.\nAristotle gives an extended analysis of voluntary actions, ones for\nwhich a person is responsible. He asserts that humans are the origin\nof their voluntary actions, and that we have the ability to do\notherwise than we do. But the problem of free will and determinism\ndoes not obviously arise in Aristotle\u2019s discussion, because he\ndoes not consider whether moral responsibility is compatible with\ncausal determinism, as a general thesis. Instead, he considers another\nthreat to our responsibility, which we may dub \u201cpsychological\ndeterminism\u201d: that our actions are automatically elicited by a\ncombination of our psychological states, such as our desires and\ncharacter traits, in conjunction with perceptual input, such that we are not\nreally in control of what we do. In response, Aristotle argues that we are in control of our character, because it is a result of\nour earlier voluntary actions. Epicurus agrees with Aristotle that we\nare in charge of our character, which results in our actions, and he\nalso contends that to argue that people are not responsible for their\nactions is self-refuting. Finally, Epicurus believes that causal\ndeterminism is incompatible with human freedom, and he introduces an\nindeterministic atomic motion, the \u201cswerve\u201d, to combat\nthis threat\u2014although how it is supposed to do so is unclear. The\nStoics, on the other hand, affirm that every single event is causally\ndetermined by God in accordance with his providential plan, and they\ntry to show how what we do is under our control in such a world. The\nlater Aristotelian Alexander of Aphrodisias reacts to the Stoics by\nbuilding an Aristotelian theory on which the ability to do otherwise\nis required for moral responsibility, and such an ability is\nincompatible with causal determinism. Plotinus, who takes himself to\nbe following Plato, incorporates Stoic elements into his own theory of\nfreedom, but his deep disagreements with Stoic metaphysics lead him to\nreject much of what they say about fate.\n", "toc": [{"#FataBivaDete": "1.

Fatalism, Bivalence, and Determinism\n\nIn the ancient world, a number of arguments were put forward that\nproceed from the Principle of Bivalence, a basic principle in logic,\nin order to establish fatalism\u2014where \u201cfatalism\u201d is\nthe view that the future is inevitable and we are powerless to do\nanything to shape it. Most prominently, these arguments are presented\nin chapter 9 of On Interpretation, Aristotle\u2019s treatise\non semantics, and in Cicero\u2019s On Fate, which discusses\nthe \u201cLazy Argument\u201d. The \u201cMaster Argument\u201d, a\nsimilar argument for the necessity of the future that was taken to\nhave fatalist implications, is both put forward and endorsed by\nDiodorus Cronus (died c. 284 BCE). These arguments differ in their\ndetails, but in broad strokes here is how they all proceed.\n(Henceforward, \u201cthe fatalist argument\u201d refers to this\ngeneral argument.)\n\nThe Principle of Bivalence (PB) states that every statement has\nexactly one truth value: either true, or false. And because PB does\napply to every statement, it applies also to statements about what\nwill occur in the future. (The example Aristotle gives is \u201cthere\nwill be a sea battle tomorrow\u201d, while in On Fate Cicero\ntalks about \u201cyou will recover from this illness\u201d.) So for\nany pair of contradictory statements about the future\u2014such as\n\u201cyou will recover from this illness\u201d and \u201cyou will\nnot recover from this illness\u201d\u2014exactly one of them is\ntrue, and has been true from eternity (Fat. 29, LS 55S; see the\n Bibliography for abbreviations used).\n But if it is true from eternity that an event will occur, then that\nevent is necessary (Fat. 21, LS 38G). Since PB applies to\nevery statement about what might occur in the future, every future\nevent is necessary. (This is why, in the context of contemporary\ndiscussions of fatalist arguments that proceed from PB, PB is\nsometimes referred to as \u201clogical determinism\u201d.) However,\nbecause there is no point in deliberating about what is necessary\n(Int. 9 18b31\u201336), there is no point in deliberating about\nanything in the future. As Aristotle puts it, if the fatalist argument\ngoes through, \n\n\nthere would be no need to deliberate or to take trouble (thinking that\nif we do this, this will happen, but if we do not it will not). For\nthere is nothing to prevent someone\u2019s having said ten thousand\nyears beforehand that this would be the case, and another\u2019s\nhaving denied it; so that whichever of the two was true to say then,\nwill be the case of necessity. (Int. 9 18b31\u201336) \n\n\nAristotle makes it clear that it does not matter whether people\nactually made such predictions; what matters is that one of the\nuttered statements would have been true. Or as Cicero says, if it has\nbeen true from eternity that you will recover from an\nillness, then there would be no point in trying to bring about the recovery,\nsince it will happen no matter what you do (Fat. 28, LS\n55S).\n\nWhy believe the argument\u2019s premise that, if a statement has been\ntrue from eternity, then the event that it predicts is necessary? One\ncommon reason is the immutability of the past, that we cannot now do\nanything to change the past. This immutability is the reason the Stoic\nChrysippus gives (against Cleanthes, who preceded him as head of the\nStoa) for why the past is necessary (Fat. 14, LS 38E). And if\nthe past is necessary, it might seem to follow that I cannot now do\nanything to change the past truth of statements about the future.\nAristotle thinks that the present is also necessary, saying\n\u201cWhat is, necessarily is, when it is; and what is not,\nnecessarily is not, when it is not\u201d (Int.\n19a23\u20135). After all, if I am presently bleeding from a wound,\nwhile it might be possible for me either to bleed to death or not, and\nI might do something to make it the case that I don\u2019t bleed to\ndeath, I cannot do anything to change the fact that I am bleeding\nright now. But then, the present truth of a statement about what will\nresult from my wound may also seem to make the outcome necessary, as\nmuch as the past truth would.\n\nIn connection with this argument, \u201cnecessary\u201d does not\nmean metaphysically necessary, causally necessary, or logically\nnecessary. Instead, things that are necessary are inevitable or beyond\nour power to affect. Aristotle gives mathematical truths, celestial\nmotions and the past as examples of things we do not bother\ndeliberating about. Aristotle, Epicurus, the academic skeptic\nCarneades, and the Stoic Chrysippus all wish to reject the conclusion\nof the fatalist argument, but they have different responses to the\nargument based on their views about whether the Principle of Bivalence\nis compatible with effective deliberation. After Aristotle, they\nalso consider whether causal determinism is compatible with effective\ndeliberation.\n1.1 Aristotle and tomorrow\u2019s sea battle\n\nAristotle thinks that the conclusion of the fatalist argument is\nfalse, because it is obvious that deliberation is not futile:\nwe often deliberate about what to do, act upon that deliberation, and\nthereby bring things about that otherwise would not have occurred. And\nmore generally, there are many things that are not necessary before\nthey happen, but may either occur or not occur. Aristotle gives the\nexample of a cloak wearing out: before it wore out, it did not\nhave to wear out, as it was still possible that it be cut up\ninstead. (Int. 9 19a8\u2013a22)\n\nUnfortunately, how Aristotle rejects the conclusion is less\nclear than that he rejects it, because De\nInterpretatione 9 is an extremely compressed text (see Gaskin\n1995 and chapter 6 of Van Rijen 1989 for details). But on the most\ncommon and historically influential interpretation, Aristotle responds\nto the argument by rejecting its premise, that the Principle of\nBivalence applies universally. Instead, it is true only for the most\npart and does not apply to statements about the future that can\npossibly be true or false, such as \u201cthere will be a sea battle\ntomorrow\u201d or \u201cthis cloak will be cut up\u201d.\nLet\u2019s take the statement, \u201cOver 100,000 people will die of\nCovid-19 in the United States in 2020\u201d. Before 100,001 people\ndie, it is not inevitable that this will occur; instead, it depends on\nwhat people do, and the statement is neither true nor false. Once\n100,001 people die, then the statement changes truth value from\nNeutral or Indeterminate to True, as well as becoming necessary for us\nnow, because we can no longer do anything about it.\n1.2 Epicurus on the fatalist argument and determinism\n\nIn his response to the fatalist argument, Epicurus largely follows\nAristotle (at least as Aristotle is commonly interpreted). He agrees\nwith Aristotle that some things happen of necessity, and some by\nchance, while others depend on us (Ep. Men. 133, NE\n3.3 1112a30\u201332). And he also thinks that, if the Principle of\nBivalence applied to all statements, everything would be necessary,\nand so he rejects it, saying that statements like \u201cPhiloctetes\nwill be wounded\u201d are neither true nor false before Philoctetes\nis wounded or not (Fat. 37, LS 20H). Unlike Aristotle\n(Int. 9 19a30\u201333), Epicurus rejects not only PB, but also the\nLaw of Excluded Middle\u2014the principle that every statement of the\nform \u201cp or not-p\u201d is necessarily true. So Aristotle thinks\nthat the statement \u201ceither there will be a sea battle tomorrow,\nor there will not be\u201d is true, while Epicurus does not.\nRejecting the Law of Excluded Middle might seem strange\u2014after\nall, doesn\u2019t p or not-p exhaust all of logical space?\nBut Epicurus apparently thinks that for the disjunction as a whole to\nbe true, one of its disjuncts would have to be true, and he does not\nwant to admit this, because then (per the fatalist argument)\nthat disjunct would also be necessary (Cicero, Academica\n2.97, LS 20I).\n\nCausal determinism does not figure into the fatalist argument in\nAristotle\u2019s De Interpretatione, or in Diodorus\nCronus\u2019 Master Argument for the necessity of the future.\nInstead, the arguments rely entirely on semantic and logical\nconsiderations. Cicero\u2019s On Fate, however, introduces\nthe topics of the relationship of causal determinism to the principle\nof bivalence, and of whether causal determinism has fatalistic\nimplications. In this treatise, Cicero presents the positions of\nEpicurus, the Academic skeptic Carneades, and the Stoic\nChrysippus.\n\nEpicurus and the Stoics believe that the principle of bivalence with\nregard to statements about the future and causal determinism are\ninterentailing: that is, a statement about the future is true if and\nonly if there exists at that time sufficient causal conditions to\nbring about the state of affairs described in the statement.\n(Likewise, a statement will be false if and only if there exist\nsufficient conditions to preclude the state of affairs described in\nthe statement, and neither true nor false if current conditions are\nsufficient neither to bring about nor to preclude the state of affairs\ndescribed in the statement.) As the Stoics put it, \n\n\nThere cannot be things which are going to be true if they do not have\ncauses of their future being. So things which are true must\nnecessarily have causes. (Fat. 26, LS 70G) \n\n\nEpicurus agrees (Fat. 19). On the other hand, if there is\n\u201cmotion without a cause\u201d, i.e., events that are not\ncausally determined, then both Epicurus and the Stoics agree that not\nevery statement is either true or false (Fat. 20\u20131, LS 38G).\nThe future has not occurred yet, so nothing exists at present to make\na statement about the future true unless there presently exist\nsufficient conditions to bring about the state of affairs predicted by\nthe statement.\n\nEpicurus is a materialist in his metaphysics. For Epicurus, the two\nentities that exist per se are bodies and the empty space\n(the void) that they move in. The bodies that we see are aggregates of\natoms, which are minute, uncuttable bodies. Anything else that\nexists\u2014such as colors, time, or justice\u2014depends for its\nexistence on the existence of bodies and void. And so, everything that\noccurs depends ultimately on the motions of atoms through the void,\nwith atomic motions caused by things like the atoms\u2019 past\nmotions and their collisions and entanglements with other atoms.\nEpicurus\u2019 predecessor Democritus, one of the original inventors\nof atomism, thought that these were the only causes of atomic motion.\nThe Epicureans believe that Democritus\u2019 position would imply\nthat the future is predetermined in a way that would make action and\ndeliberation futile (Diogenes of Oinoanda, (inscription)\n32.1.14\u20143.14, LS 20G), and Epicurus wants to avoid being \n\n\na slave to the \u2018fate\u2019 of the natural\nphilosophers\u2026which involves an inexorable necessity. (Ep.\nMen.134, LS 20A) \n\n\nSince he thinks that both the logical principle of bivalence and\ncausal determinism have fatalistic implications, he rejects both\nbivalence and causal determinism. In order to avoid fatalism, within\nhis materialism and atomism, Epicurus posits an indeterministic atomic\nmotion, the \u201cswerve\u201d (Fat. 22, LS 20E). As the\nEpicurean poet Lucretius puts it, if atomic motion were caused only by\nthe weight of atoms and their collisions and entanglements, human\nbeings, as well as all other animals, would be subject to necessity\nand unable to move themselves around as they please. But we obviously\ncan move ourselves around as we please, and so there is another cause\nof atomic motion, an occasional minute swerve to the side that occurs\n\u201cat no fixed region of space or fixed time\u201d and liberates\nus from fate (DRN 2.251\u201393, LS 20F). Because determinism is\nfalse, the future is still open, and statements like \u201cyou will\nrecover from an illness\u201d are, at present, neither true nor\nfalse.\n1.3 Carneades on the fatalist argument and a voluntary motion of our minds\n\nCarneades also wishes to rebut the fatalist argument and deny that\nwhat will occur is\n inevitable.[1]\n Unlike Aristotle and Epicurus, however, he does not reject the\nPrinciple of Bivalence, and he says that whenever you have a pair of\ncontradictory statements, such as \u201cTim O\u2019Keefe will die\nfrom cancer\u201d and \u201cTim O\u2019Keefe will not die from\ncancer\u201d, one is true and the other false (Fat. 37, LS\n20H). Instead of rejecting PB, he thinks the fatalist argument goes\nwrong when it assumes that if it is true from eternity that an event\nwill occur, then that event is necessary. That is because both\nEpicurus and Stoics are wrong to believe that the principle of\nbivalence and causal determinism are interentailing. The truth of a\nstatement does not imply that there are \u201cimmutable eternal\ncauses\u201d that make it true (Fat. 28, LS 70G).\nInstead, it is simply the fact that things will turn out as the\nstatement says they will that makes it true.\n\nAn example to illustrate Carneades\u2019 position: let us imagine\nthat Tim O\u2019Keefe develops cancer, but he seeks out treatment,\nrecovers, and ends up dying peacefully in his sleep of other causes at\nthe age of 100, in 2068. If somebody were to say, in 2020, \u201cTim\nO\u2019Keefe will not die of cancer\u201d, they said something true,\nbecause, just as they said, Tim O\u2019Keefe in fact did not die of\ncancer. Their statement was not \u201cneutral\u201d when they made\nit, and later became true; it was true all along. In order to\ndefend his position, Carneades appeals to the symmetry of the past and\nfuture: \n\n\nFor just as we call \u201ctrue\u201d those past things of which it\nwas at an earlier time true that they were being actualized, so we\nwill call \u201ctrue\u201d those future things that of which it will\nlater be true that they are being actualized. (Fat. 27, LS\n70G) \n\n\nJust as something\u2019s being true in the past does not depend on\nits having certain effects now, something\u2019s being true\nin the future does not depend on its having certain causes\nnow. If the statement \u201cTim O\u2019Keefe was adopted in\n1968\u201d is now true, it is not true because he presently remembers\nbeing told by his mother and father that they adopted him, or because\nof any of the other present effects of his adoption. Instead, it is\ntrue simply because he was, as a matter of fact, adopted in 1968.\n\nTo understand Carneades\u2019 position, we should distinguish between\nthe truthmaker for a statement and the cause of an\nevent. If I go to the doctor and recover from my cancer, the\ncause of my recovering from the disease is the doctor\u2019s\ntreatment, and the cause of my going to the doctor is my decision to\ndo so. The truthmaker for the statement \u201cTim will\nrecover from his cancer\u201d is my recovering from the cancer, but\nthe statement\u2019s eternal truth doesn\u2019t cause my\nfuture recovery. Once we make this distinction, then we should see\nthat the principle of bivalence does not threaten our freedom.\nAccording to Carneades, our own voluntary actions are one of the\ncauses of events. And these actions are under our control. The way\nCarneades puts it is that the cause of our actions is a\n\u201cvoluntary motion of the mind\u201d, a motion which has an\nintrinsic nature of being in our power and of obeying us\n(Fat. 24\u20135, LS 20E). There is a truth beforehand concerning\nhow I will act, e.g., that I will seek out treatment for my cancer.\nBut my action of seeking out treatment is nonetheless under my\ncontrol, and my seeking out the treatment is not necessary, as I have\nthe ability not to seek out the treatment. (Consider here\nCarneades\u2019 analogy with the past: just because there is a truth\nabout how I did voluntarily act in the past, this does not imply that\nmy past actions were not under my control, or that it was necessary\nthat I act in the ways that I did.)\n\nCarneades thinks that, while the fatalist argument from bivalence\nfails, the fatalist argument can be successfully restated in terms of\ncausal determinism, since causal determinism is incompatible with our\nactions truly being in our power (Fat. 31, LS 70G.) That is\nbecause, for our actions to be in our power, we must have the ability\nto make things turn out otherwise than they actually do turn out\n(Fat. 45), and this ability is incompatible with all things\nbeing predetermined by an interconnected chain of natural causes\n(Fat. 31, LS 70G). According to Carneades, human actions have\na cause\u2014the \u201cvoluntary motion of the mind\u201d\u2014but\nthe way in which we exercise this power and move ourselves is not\nitself causally necessitated.\n\nThis is why Carneades denies that even the gods can foretell the\nfuture. Carneades assumes that to know what is going to occur in the\nfuture, you must know the present causes which will bring about that\nfuture event. For instance, in order to know that a major earthquake\nwill occur in California a year hence, I would need to have\ninformation about the present disposition of California\u2019s\nvarious faults and the pressure they are exerting on one another,\nalong with the facts about things like how faults operate, which all\ntogether will bring about the future quake. Not even Apollo, however,\ncan foretell events like Oedipus killing his father, even though it\nhas always been true that Oedipus would do so. That is\nbecause such actions, before they occur, have no pre-existing causes\nthat would bring them about, that Apollo could inspect in order to\ntell that they are going to occur (Fat. 32\u201333, LS 70G).\n1.4 The Stoics on the fatalist argument and co-fated events\n\nEpicurus believes that both the Principle of Bivalence and causal\ndeterminism are false; the Stoics believe that both are true, and that\ntheir truth does not render us powerless or make what will happen\ninevitable. In fact, the Stoics think that every event is both\ncausally determined and fated. The Stoics believe that God is wise,\ngood, perfectly happy, and creator of the world (DL 7.147, LS\n54A). But God is not an immaterial entity separate from the world who\ncreated it ex nihilo\u2014instead, god is the\nworld. and his mind pervades and organizes all things (Cicero, On\nthe Nature of the Gods 1.39, LS 54B; Alexander, On\nMixture 225, 1\u20132, LS 54H). Because God is good, he wishes to\nbenefit everything (Clement, The teacher 1.8.63 1\u20132, LS 60I).\nSo God\u2019s providential will is to make the world the best he can.\nGod is extremely powerful but not omnipotent, as he works within the\nlimits of what is physically possible, like a craftsman skillfully\nbuilding something with the materials at hand. The way God realizes\nhis providential will is through setting up the causal order of the\nworld to bring it about. Fate is an everlasting \u201cordering and\nsequence of causes\u201d which brings about every single thing that\nhas happened, is happening, and is going to happen. This is \u201cnot\nthe \u2018fate\u2019 of superstition, but that of physics\u201d\n(Cicero, On Divination 1.125\u20136, LS 55L). So for example, if\nGod has it as part of his providential plan that I will recover from\ncancer, God will fate my recovery by building that future event into\nthe overall organization of the cosmos from its foundation, so that\nthe fated recovery will necessarily arise as the series of causes\nunspools itself over time.\n\nThe Stoics believe that having everything that occurs fated in this\nway is compatible with our deliberating and acting effectively. To see\nthis, consider the following example. Suppose that I am a Stoic, and I\ncontract cancer. As a Stoic, I realize that it has been true from\neternity and fated either that I will recover from the cancer, or that\nI will not. But that does not render the outcome of my cancer\ninevitable or make it pointless for me to seek treatment. The Stoic\nChrysippus says that certain outcomes are simple, while\nothers are conjoined. Simple outcomes are ones that will occur no\nmatter what I do. For instance, as a mortal being, that I will die is\ninevitable; it will happen no matter what I\n do.[2]\n In the case of such simple outcomes, deliberation and action would be\npointless. However, other things are conjoined, where an outcome is\nlinked to its cause, which is necessary for it to occur. For instance,\nif Oedipus is going to be born of Laius, that is conjoined with Laius\nand Jocasta having intercourse. In the case of my fated recovery from\ncancer, that fated recovery is conjoined to my action of seeking\ntreatment, and Chrysippus says that the two are\n\u201cco-fated\u201d: it is fated (and causally determined)\nboth that I will recover from the cancer and that I\nwill seek treatment; it is through my fated action of seeking\ntreatment that my fated recovery will occur (Fat. 30, LS\n55S). Since my action of seeking treatment is causally efficacious in\nbringing about its purpose, it isn\u2019t pointless. My action is\nitself both causally determined and causally efficacious. Furthermore,\neven if it\u2019s causally determined that I\u2019ll recover,\ncounterfactuals like \u201cif I don\u2019t seek treatment, I will\ndie\u201d can still be true. As Chrysippus puts it, even if\nit\u2019s true (and causally determined) that somebody will wrestle,\nit doesn\u2019t follow that they\u2019ll wrestle whether or not they\nhave an opponent, and even if it\u2019s true (and causally determined)\nthat somebody will recover from a disease, it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat they\u2019ll recover whether or not they call a doctor\n(Fat. 30, LS 55S).\n\nThe Stoics say that actions like my seeking treatment for cancer,\nwhich are brought about by fate through the animal,\nare \u201cin the power\u201d of the animal, but they deny that we\nare free to choose between opposite actions\u2014seeking\ntreatment or not seeking treatment (Alexander, On Fate ch 13,\n181,13\u2013182,20, LS 62G). The Stoics believe Carneades is wrong to think\nthat we need such a power to choose between opposite actions in order\nto stave off the fatalist argument and avoid its conclusion that the\nfuture is inevitable and we are powerless to do anything to shape it.\nEven if my action of seeking treatment is causally determined, and I\ndo not have the ability not to seek treatment, seeking treatment can\nstill lead to the cure of my cancer, a cure that would not have\nhappened if I had not sought treatment. Like Aristotle, who was not\nwilling to give up the idea that we effectively deliberate about our\nactions, the Stoics posit that I can effectively and rationally\ndeliberate about what to do, even if the outcome of my deliberation\nand the actions that result from it are both causally determined. If I\nam in an unclear situation, considering the pros and cons of various\nactions is rational and will likely lead to a better decision than\nacting impulsively. Consider an example where I am offered a job, and\nI think things through before deciding to accept it. I had to go\nthrough the process of deliberation to reach that fated outcome;\nit\u2019s no more true that I would have accepted the job whether or\nnot I deliberated about the offer than it is that I would have\nrecovered from cancer whether or not I sought treatment. So in the\noriginal fatalist argument, the Stoics would reject the premise that\nif it is true from eternity that an event will occur, then that event\nis necessary, in the sense of inevitable or beyond our power to\neffect, and they also reject Carneades\u2019 assertion that events\nthat have been causally determined from eternity are necessary in that\nsense.\n\nZeno, the founder of Stoicism, and Chrysippus were each said to\ncompare the relationship of humans and fate to that of a dog tied to a\ncart: \n\n\nWhen a dog is tied to a cart, if it wants to follow it is pulled and\nfollows, making its spontaneous act coincide with necessity, but if it\ndoes not want to follow it will be compelled in any case. So it is\nwith men too: even if they do not want to, they will be compelled in\nany case to follow what is destined. (Hippolytus, Refutation of\nall heresies 1.21, LS 62A) \n\n\nThis analogy suggests that god has preordained certain outcomes that\nwill happen no matter what decisions people make, with our decisions\naffecting only the manner in which this fated outcome occurs.\nGod will bypass and override any efforts to defy him. (Perhaps if I\nirrationally decide not to seek treatment for my cancer, god\nimplements a contingency plan that ensures my fated recovery, albeit\nin a way that involves far more trouble and pain for me.)\n\nBut at least as deployed by Chrysippus, the above interpretation of\nthe dog and cart analogy is probably incorrect. If certain outcomes\nwere fated to occur no matter what we were to decide or to do, that\nwould seem to make deliberation and action futile, whereas Chrysippus\nwishes to assert that our actions do have an impact on what occurs,\nwith god bringing about the fated outcome through our fated action.\nInstead, Chrysippus is probably making the more general point that it\nis impossible to resist god\u2019s providential plan and the edicts\nof fate, and that trying to do so is a bad idea. That is because\ngod\u2019s providential plan encompasses everything whatsoever that\noccurs in the cosmos, which would include even vicious actions and\nattempts to defy god (Plutarch, On Stoic Self-Contradiction\n1050c-d, LS 54T). The Stoics also share the Greek ethical commonplace\nthat vice is a kind is psychic disharmony and disorder that causes\nagitation and distress (Cicero, Tusculan disputations 4.29,\n34\u20135, LS 61O). Furthermore, the wise person willingly submits themself\nto god\u2019s will\u2014they wish for things to happen as they do\nhappen, which is the same as wishing for them to happen as god wills them\nto happen. Such submission brings happiness (Epictetus,\nHandbook 8; Seneca, On Benefits 4.34.4). And so, a\nvicious person who tries to defy the will of god fails in their plan, as\neven their attempted defiance has been fated by god, but through their\nfoolish actions they do \u201csucceed\u201d in bringing about their\nown misery, just like the dog being dragged along the path.\n2. Voluntary Action, Moral Responsibility, and What is \u201cUp to Us\u201d\n\nAncient Greek philosophers considered when we are rightly held\naccountable for our actions, and these discussions overlap\nconsiderably with contemporary debates about free will and\ndeterminism. But we should be cautious about framing these debates in terms of their views on free will and determinism.\nFirst of all, there is no phrase in the ancient texts that should\nobviously be translated as \u201cfree will\u201d. (The later\nEpicurean Lucretius uses the Latin phrase libera voluntas,\nwhich is often translated as \u201cfree will\u201d, but whether\nlibera voluntas is the same as \u201cfree will\u201d is far\nfrom obvious\u2014see section\n 2.4.1\n below.) Instead of talking about whether humans possess a faculty of\nwill, and what the conditions are for that will to be free, they talk\nabout when actions are voluntary, and what must obtain in order for\nour actions or states of character to be \u201cup to us\u201d\n(eph\u2019 hemin) or to \u201cdepend on us\u201d\n(par\u2019 hemas). Secondly, the ancient discussions do not\nhave at their center the question of whether causal determinism is\ncompatible with our having control over our actions\u2014in\nparticular, whether it is compatible with the ability to do\notherwise\u2014although they do raise this issue.\n2.1 Aristotle on voluntary action\n\nThe first extended treatment of moral responsibility is\nAristotle\u2019s in NE 3.1\u20135. Voluntary actions, says\nAristotle, are subject to praise and blame, whereas involuntary ones\nare excused (NE 3.1 1109b30\u201332). Voluntary actions are ones\nwith their origin in the agent themself, where they know the\nparticular circumstances of the action (NE 3.1 1111a23\u201324).\nTo say that the origin of an action is the agent simply means that the\ncause or explanation of an action is the person\u2019s own beliefs,\ndesires, states of character, and other psychological states. If I\ndecide to poison my mother for the sake of getting my inheritance, the\naction of putting cyanide into a mug of chamomile and almond tea can\nbe explained by my greed and callousness, by my resulting desire for\nthe inheritance and disregard for the welfare of my mother, and by my\nbelief that poisoning my mother would be an effective means to\nobtaining the inheritance. On the other hand, forced actions are\ninvoluntary\u2014for instance, the movement of a sea voyager who is\nblown astray by a wind or carried away by kidnappers. In such cases,\nthe person\u2019s movements have an external origin, and they\nthemself don\u2019t contribute anything to their movements.\n\nBesides force, another excusing condition is non-culpable ignorance of\nparticular matters of fact regarding the circumstances of the action.\nIf my mother\u2019s joints are aching, and I bring her some Tylenol\ncapsules that, unbeknownst to me, have been laced with cyanide, I\nshould not be blamed for her death. Even though my action of bringing\nthe capsules has an \u201cinternal origin\u201d, I did not willingly\nkill my mother\u2014rather, it was inadvertent, and my action evinces\nno malevolent desires or character flaws. (Nonetheless, says\nAristotle, I should regret what I have done and feel pain at it. If I\ndo not, then something is wrong with me, and so the action is not\nentirely involuntary, but \u201cnon-voluntary\u201d (NE 3.1\n1110b18\u201324).) But not all ignorance excuses. For instance, if I\nwillingly get drunk, and therefore I don\u2019t notice a stop sign\nand end up inadvertently harming somebody when I run the stop sign, I\nam responsible for putting myself into the state of ignorance, and\nhence responsible for my subsequent actions. Also, Aristotle believes\nthat ignorance of what is good and bad does not excuse a person. If I am\ndepraved enough, I might sincerely believe that I am doing nothing\nwrong when I poison my mother, that I am simply being savvy and\nappropriately ruthless in pursuing my self-interest. That\nkind of ignorance, says Aristotle, is what makes people vicious, and\nbeing a bad person isn\u2019t an excuse for acting badly (NE\n3.1 110b28\u20131111a2). (As we shall see, Aristotle believes that people\nare at least partly responsible for their own characters.)\n\nAristotle also discusses \u201cmixed actions\u201d, ones that are\ndone knowingly but unwillingly. He gives the examples of a captain\ntossing their cargo overboard to save their ship during a storm, and a\nperson doing something dishonorable at the order of a tyrant in order\nto save the lives of their family. These are not the sorts of actions\nthey would normally perform, but they feel forced to do so under the\ncircumstances. Such actions, says Aristotle, are voluntary,\nand the agent is responsible for them\u2014after all, the origin of\nthe action was inside the agent, and they knew the particular\ncircumstances of their actions. However, when assessing actions, we\nneed to take those circumstances in account, so that actions that\nnormally would be wrong, like tossing cargo overboard, are sometimes\nactually praiseworthy and reflect well on the agent.\n\nFinally, Aristotle says that sometimes people do wrong actions\n\u201cunder pressure which overstrains human nature and which no one\ncould withstand\u201d, and such actions are forgiven (NE 3.1\n1110a23\u201325). Unfortunately, he does not give an example or explain why\nsuch actions are pardoned. But a plausible example would be in the\nnovel 1984, when Winston Smith betrays his lover Julia at the\npoint where O\u2019Brien threatens to have his face chewed off by\nrats, after months of torture in the bowels of the Ministry of Love.\nWhile the betrayal does have an \u201cinternal origin\u201d in\nSmith\u2019s terror of the rats and his belief that betraying Julia\nwould spare him, almost any human being would have been broken under\nthe circumstances. Therefore, when we wish to explain why Smith\nbetrays Julia, it is not because of any character flaws or disordered\ndesires particular to Smith\u2014instead, we say that no matter\nwhether a person was virtuous or vicious, they would have acted as\nSmith did in such a situation, so Smith\u2019s betrayal doesn\u2019t reflect\nbadly on him.\n\nWhen an action is voluntary and its origin is within us, it is up to\nus either to perform the action or not (NE 3.1 1110a17\u201318),\nso if it\u2019s up to us to perform some action which is noble, we\nalso have the ability not to act, which would be base (NE 3.5\n1113b5\u201314). Since we have the ability to do otherwise in the case of\nall voluntary actions, and it is only for voluntary actions that\npeople are rightly held responsible, Aristotle endorses the Principle\nof Alternate Possibilities (PAP): a person is morally responsible for\nwhat they have done only if they could have done otherwise.\n\nWhether Aristotle\u2019s theory of what is voluntary is compatibilist\nor incompatibilist with regard to causal determinism is highly\ncontested. But the question itself may be misguided, as Aristotle\nnever formulates the thesis of causal determinism or asks whether\ndeterminism is compatible with people engaging in voluntary actions.\nThe best we can do is ask whether, given his other philosophical\ncommitments, Aristotle\u2019s conditions on voluntary action are best\nunderstood as compatible with determinism, or incompatible with it.\nSome contemporary philosophers believe that causal determinism is\nincompatible with an agent genuinely being the source of his action,\nas his action could be traced back to environmental, genetic, and\nother factors outside of and prior to the agent. But Aristotle seems\nnot to be working with that strong a notion of sourcehood when he says\nthat the agent is the origin of his actions: he says that choice is\norigin of action, while desire and practical reason are the origin of\nchoice (NE 6.2 1139a32\u201333). So Y can be the origin of Z,\nwhile Y itself has an origin in X. Likewise, many philosophers believe\nthat PAP is incompatible with causal determinism, while others believe\nthat they are compatible. Aristotle himself is silent on the issue,\nand he never produces an explication of what exactly he means when he\nsays an agent who acts voluntarily could have done otherwise. However,\nhe does think that virtue is a perfection of a person\u2019s\ncharacter, one that reliably produces virtuous actions. The virtuous\nperson has both correct beliefs about what to do, and correct desires,\nso he would seem to have no motive to do anything other than the right\nthing, and Aristotle does say that the virtuous person would never\nvoluntarily do anything vicious (NE 4.9 1128b25\u201330). So it\nseems that, while the virtuous person who voluntarily performs a\nvirtuous action could have acted otherwise and done something\nvicious, nonetheless there are sufficient conditions\u2014ones that\ninclude his own virtue\u2014which preclude him from exercising this\nability. While opinions on the question are divided, perhaps the\nsafest thing to say is that Aristotle\u2019s theory is compatible\nwith compatibilism. (See Destr\u00e9e (2011) for an incompatibilist\ninterpretation of Aristotle based on \u2018sourcehood\u2019 and\nAristotle\u2019s acceptance of PAP, and Bobzien (2014) for\ncriticisms. Meyer (2011) gives an interpretation on which\nAristotle\u2019s theory of voluntary action and of character\nformation is compatible with compatibilism.)\n2.2 Aristotle on character formation\n\nAlthough Aristotle says that voluntary actions are subject to praise\nand blame, he does not simply identify morally responsible actions\nwith voluntary ones. Small children and animals can engage in\nvoluntary behavior, moving themselves around, using the information\nthey have about their environment, in order to get what they want.\nWhat distinguishes adult humans from small children and other animals\nis our possession of practical reason, which allows us to deliberate\nabout what to do in order to best achieve what we believe to be good\nand then to make choices on the basis of that deliberation\n(NE 3.2\u20134). Only creatures who can make these sorts of\ndeliberative choices are capable of virtue or vice, and only such\ncreatures are accountable for what they do.\n\nFurthermore, our capacity for deliberative choice allows us to shape\nour own characters, and Aristotle thinks that we need to be able to do\nso in order to be responsible for the actions that flow from those\ncharacters. In NE 3.5, Aristotle considers an argument\nagainst our responsibility for our actions that proceeds from\npsychological determinism. It goes as follows: let us suppose that a\ncareless person exceeds the speed limit because they did not notice\nthe sign posting the limit. Aristotle says that the law rightly\npunishes such cases of ignorant wrongdoing, because the person is\nresponsible for his own negligent ignorance, just as in the case of\nthe ignorant drunkard. But, the objection goes, some people just are\ncareless; they\u2019re simply the sort of people who aren\u2019t\ngoing to take care (NE 3.5 1114a3\u20134). So it\u2019s not up to\nthem not to be careless. More generally, people do what they do\nbecause they believe it gets them what is good. But what seems good to\na person is not under their control; instead, it is determined by\ntheir character (NE 3.5 1114a30\u20131114b12). If I choose to\npoison my mother, it\u2019s because I believe that doing so will be\ngood for me. But I did not choose to believe that wealth is so\nincredibly important for my well-being, and the interests of others\nand considerations of justice so negligible, that getting lots of\nmoney through undetected murder would be good for me. As Plato says in\nhis dialogue the Timaeus, nobody is willingly evil. Instead,\nthrough some combination of poor natural endowments and poor\neducation, neither of which the evil person had under their control,\nthey become vicious. So they are not to blame for their vice; rather,\nthose who nurtured them are to blame (Tim. 86d-87a).\n\nAristotle agrees that what seems good to us is determined by our\ncharacter, and that we aim at what we believe is good. There are cases\nof akrasia, or \u201cweakness of will\u201d, where a\nperson\u2019s beliefs about what is good and their desires conflict,\nand they do what they believe is bad in order to gratify their desires\n(NE 7.3). But when a person\u2019s beliefs and desires are\nin harmony\u2014as in the case of a thoroughly virtuous or vicious\nperson\u2014their actions will follow from their beliefs about and\ndesires for what seems to be good, plus their beliefs about what means\nwill achieve that apparent good. So in the case of the vicious and\nwilling murderer, while he may be able to refrain from\nmurder, he will not do so, given who he is. He will not\nchoose to go against what his beliefs and desires have set before him\nas good. For Aristotle, choice is the final step of a process of\ndeliberation, in which we work through the possible means to achieve\nour end, until we hit upon the one that we think will work best to get\nus what we wish to achieve, whereupon we choose that means and act\n(NE 3.3).\n\nBut Aristotle thinks that this does not absolve the vicious person of\nresponsibility for their actions, because they are responsible for\nmaking themselves into the person they currently are through their\npast actions. Virtue is a state of character developed through\npractice in a way analogous to how we gain craft knowledge or other\npractical skills: I become courageous by acting courageously, just as\na person becomes a good carpenter by practicing making cabinets or a\ngood basketball player by working on their free throws (NE\n2.1). But vice is also developed through a person\u2019s repeated\nactions; it\u2019s by cheating that a person makes themselves unjust\nand by engaging in drinking bouts that they become dissolute drunkards\n(NE 3.5 1114a4\u20137). Aristotle admits that some people are\nincorrigibly bad, because they have firmly fixed bad characters, and\nhence they cannot now control what appears good to them. But at one\ntime, they had the ability to change their character, and hence they\nare responsible for what now seems good to them. Aristotle compares\nsuch a person to an incurably sick person, who made themself ill\nthrough their dissolute living and their refusal to listen to their\ndoctor\u2019s orders. The sick person is responsible for their\nsickness, even though there is nothing they can do about it now; so\ntoo with the thoroughly vicious person (NE 3.5\n1114a12\u201322).\n\nIt might seem that Aristotle\u2019s response implies a vicious\nregress. My present action is caused by my present character plus my\nother psychological states, such as my beliefs. In order to be\nresponsible for this action, I must be responsible for the state of\ncharacter that in part causes it. Aristotle responds that my past\nvoluntary actions caused my present character, and so I am responsible\nfor it. But if I must be responsible for these actions in order to be\nresponsible for the character state that they cause, we ask in turn\nwhether I am responsible for the character states that caused these\nactions, and so on and so forth, until we are drawn back to factors of\nheredity and environment which I am not responsible for. In response\nto this problem, some scholars have proposed that Aristotle believes that some\ncharacter-forming actions are not caused by my past states of\ncharacter (Kane (2014), who attributes such a view to Aristotle and\nuses it as inspiration for his own view), or that he believes there\nare some breaks or \u201cfresh starts\u201d in the causal process\nleading to my present character, so that it cannot be drawn back to\npast factors that were not in my power (Furley 1967; Bobzien 2000).\nBut it is difficult to see how positing causal breaks would help make\nthe process of character formation more under the control of a person,\nand in any case, Aristotle apparently is not aware of this supposed\nproblem with his response. Instead, he seems to think that, as long as\nwe need to refer to a person\u2019s past actions in order to explain\nhow they came to be the sort of person they are, this suffices for\nshowing that they helped form their own character and it is was up to\nthem who they became.\n2.3 Epicurus on reason, character formation, and what \u201cdepends on us\u201d\n\nLike Aristotle, Epicurus believes that our ability to shape the\ndevelopment of our character is central to our being responsible for\nour actions, and that we have this ability because of our reason.\nFurthermore, the person who argues that our actions do not depend on\nus refutes themself in the very act of arguing for their thesis.\n\nThe Epicureans think that all of our actions are explained by our desire\nfor pleasure, our aversion to pain, and our beliefs about how best to\nobtain pleasure and avoid pain (Ep. Men 128, Fin.\n1.23, 1.30 1.46). People engage in wrongdoing because they have\nincorrect beliefs about what will bring them pleasure (KD 7,\n10, SV 16, Fin. 1.32\u201333, 1.55). If a person wrongly\nbelieves that pursuing great wealth will make them happy, then they\nwill pursue wealth. But this psychological hedonism does not render us\nhelpless, because our beliefs are under our control, and it is reason\nwhich gives us this control over our beliefs. We can learn to\ndistinguish which of our desires are for things we really need, and\nwhich desires cause us harm, and thereby reject the harmful desires\n(KD 18\u201322, 29\u201330). Using our reason, we can overcome hate,\nenvy, contempt, and other emotions that might lead us to wrongdoing\n(DL 10.117).\n\nThis reasons-responsiveness is what distinguishes us from other\nanimals and allows us to control our own development, while other\nanimals cannot. Other animals have in-born temperaments: for instance,\nlions are naturally irascible because their minds contain many fire\natoms, while stags are timid because they have more wind atoms\n(DRN 3.288\u2013306). People also have natural temperaments: some\nare easily moved to anger, while others are too fearful (DRN\n3.307\u2013318). But we can use our reason to expel any harmful\ndispositions, so that only trivial traces of these temperaments\nremain, and we are able to achieve a life worthy of the gods\n(DRN 3.319\u2013322).\n\nIn book 25 of his treatise On Nature (LS 20B\u2013C), Epicurus\nalso asserts that how we develop depends on us, and then he tries to\nshow that it is self-refuting to maintain that all things occur of\nnecessity. Unfortunately, while this is an important text for\nunderstanding Epicurus, it is also extremely unclear. Epicurus has a\ncontorted and jargon-ridden writing style, and the text as we have it\nis full of gaps, because it is preserved on charred scrolls from an\nEpicurean villa buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE. So\nthe summary of his arguments below, like any summary of this text, is\nbound to be controversial, and it is considerably more clear than\nEpicurus\u2019 own arguments.\n\nEpicurus says some people have disordered congenital dispositions,\ne.g., they are naturally hotheaded due to their atomic make-up. But\nunlike wild animals, we blame a person who develops badly and remains\na hothead as an adult, because the way we actually develop depends on\nus, and not on the nature of our atoms. We each have\n\u201cseeds\u201d, psychological potentials to develop one way or\nthe other, and which \u201cseeds\u201d develop depend on us and on\nbeliefs of our own making. Further evidence for our control over\nourselves, says Epicurus, is that we rebuke, oppose, and reform each\nother as if the responsibility for what we do lies also \u201cin\nourselves\u201d, not just in our congenital dispositions and in our\nenvironment. If somebody argues against this thesis and maintains that\neverything we do is necessitated, he refutes himself. That is because\nin his action of engaging in debate, the person is assuming that he is\nresponsible for reasoning correctly and that his opponent is\nresponsible for talking nonsense.\n\nAt first blush, this self-refutation argument appears quite\nunpromising, as Epicurus\u2019 opponent has an obvious reply: they\ncan maintain that the actions of the people engaging in the debate,\nincluding their own, are necessitated, and nonetheless try to show\nthat their own position is better-supported and thereby convince their\nopponent to change their mind. Epicurus, however, thinks that this\nreply fails. We have a concept of what it means for something to be\nnecessitated, versus for something to depend on us. And the empirical\nbasis for these concepts is observing ourselves in action\u2014in\nparticular, observing our actions of rebuking, opposing, and reforming\none another. We see that we can dissuade other people from an action,\ne.g., I can talk to my friend and convince him not to give in to a\nbully\u2019s demands and to stand up to him instead. We also see that\nsometimes we decide to do things we don\u2019t feel like doing, e.g.,\nI undergo painful dental work in order to avoid greater pain in the\nfuture. From these observations, we form the distinction between\nthings that depend on us, versus ones that are necessitated, and we\nshow our understanding of this distinction in our actions, as we try\nto dissuade one another from things that \u201cdepend on us\u201d,\nwhile it would be pointless to do so for those that are necessitated.\nAccording to Epicurus, if his opponent claims that all of our actions\nare necessitated, and they do not challenge the empirical basis of our\ndistinction, they are merely \u201cchanging a name\u201d. To show\nthat our actions are necessitated in a substantial way, the opponent\nwould have to show how we are mistaken when we think that we can use\nour reason to persuade one another to act differently, that we can\ndecide to undergo short-term pain for the sake of long-term gain, and\nthe like. But the action of trying to persuade somebody to change\ntheir mind, by giving them reasons to think that their current\nconviction is mistaken, is precisely the sort of thing that forms the\nbasis for the conceptions that Epicurus\u2019 opponent is trying to\nchallenge (see Castagnoli 2010: 145\u2013159 for more on this\nargument).\n2.4 The role of the swerve in protecting our freedom\n\nAs noted above (in section 1.2), Epicurus introduces an\nindeterministic atomic motion, the swerve, in order to protect human\nfreedom. It is not mentioned in any of the extant texts by Epicurus\nhimself, but a variety of later sources attribute the doctrine to him.\nThe two most extensive discussions we have of the swerve\u2019s role\nin protecting human freedom are in Cicero\u2019s On Fate,\nwhich describes how the swerve is needed in order to preserve the\nopenness of the future and avert the fatalistic implications of the\nPrinciple of Bivalence, and in lines 251\u2013293 of Book 2 of On\nthe Nature of Things, Lucretius\u2019 exposition of Epicurean\nphysics.\n\nLucretius argues that is evident that animals can and do act freely.\nHowever, if atoms did not sometimes randomly swerve to the side,\nanimals would not be able to act freely. Therefore, atoms sometimes\nrandomly swerve to the side. In this argument, Lucretius moves from\nsomething he thinks we can observe (that animals act freely), and on\nits basis infers something that we cannot directly perceive (that\natoms swerve slightly to the side). Free actions are ones where the\nbody follows the mind\u2019s desires (DRN 2.268), and free\nactions have an \u201cinternal source\u201d in a literal sense for\nLucretius: they are produced by the animal\u2019s mind, which is a\nbodily organ in its chest.\n\nLucretius spends most of his argument establishing the premise that\nanimals do, in fact, act freely, by giving two examples. Both examples\nare supposed to show that animals have an internal capacity to\ninitiate motion, which distinguishes animal motion from the way in\nwhich inanimate objects are simply moved around by external blows. The\nfirst example is of race horses eager to burst from the starting\ngates. Lucretius claims that we see a slight delay between the\nexternal stimulus of the opening of the gates and the resultant motion\nof the horses surging forward. This delay supposedly shows that there\nexists motion initiated by the mind, in which case it takes some time\nfor the decision of the mind to stir together and move all of the\nmatter of the horse. The second example appeals to our own experience,\nin cases such as being in a jostling crowd: we are not always\nhelplessly shoved around by these outside forces but are sometimes\nable to fight against them to go where we wish, and we initiate this\nmotion ourselves.\n\nUnfortunately, Lucretius is much less forthcoming in supporting or\nelucidating his other premise. If there were not a swerve, and causal\ndeterminism were true, why would animals be unable to act freely? And\nhow exactly is the swerve supposed to help preserve freedom? At the\nstart of his argument, Lucretius says that if there were not an atomic\nswerve, to prevent all motion from being interlinked in an endless\nchain of causation and thereby to annul the decrees of fate, we would\nnot have the ability to move ourselves around as we wished. And at the end\nof his argument, Lucretius says that, in order for our actions not to\nbe subject to an \u201cinternal necessity\u201d, there must be an\natomic motion that is not necessitated, since nothing comes to be from\nnothing (DRN 2.284\u2013293). A number of answers to the above\nquestions have been advanced, but each of these interpretations\nsuffers from philosophical and textual problems. Below are some of these\nanswers.\n2.4.1 Free will and the ability to do otherwise\n\nA common way of answering these questions is to say that free will is\nincompatible with causal determinism because determinism precludes us\nfrom having the ability to do otherwise than we do, and this ability\nis needed to have free will (Purinton 1999). Human beings are\naggregates of atoms, and our decisions are caused by the motions of\nthe atoms that make up our minds. If the atoms that make us up moved\nin accordance with deterministic laws\u2014if we were subject to\n\u201cinternal necessity\u201d\u2014then we would be unable to act\notherwise than how we do act. But because the atoms in our mind can\nswerve, then it is possible for me to do otherwise than I do. There is\na range of possible outcomes for any action I take, depending on\nwhether, when, and how many atoms in my mind swerve. And so, I have\nfree will and can be rightly held responsible for my actions.\n\nOne problem with this interpretation is that Lucretius does not seem\nconcerned with moral responsibility or the ability to do otherwise.\nThe Latin phrase Lucretius uses for what allows us to \u201cact\nfreely\u201d is libera voluntas, which is often translated\nas \u201cfree will\u201d. But libera voluntas is not\nsomething particular to adult humans, who can be held morally\nresponsible for their actions. It is shared by all animals. And\nlibera voluntas is not described as an ability to do\notherwise, which allows animals to be accountable for what they do.\nInstead, libera voluntas is effective agency; it allows\nliving creatures all over the earth to do what they want to\ndo and to advance wherever pleasure leads them (DRN\n2.251\u2013260). And in any case, inserting random atomic swerves into\none\u2019s mind is an unpromising basis for the production of free\nand responsible actions; instead, it would seem to result in random\nand blameless twitches. Let us imagine that after thinking things\nover, I am getting ready to pick up the phone and accept a job offer,\nbut before I pick up the phone, a series of atomic swerves occur in my\nmind, and I start singing Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Are the\nChampions\u201d instead. Is the singing a free and responsible\naction? Or if I do pick up the phone and accept the job, does the\npossibility that random atomic swerves might have caused me to sing\ninstead help preserve my free will? To the extent that random swerves\nare involved in action, they seem to undercut our control over our\nactions, rather than preserve it.\n2.4.2 Character development and internal necessity\n\nAlternatively, it has been proposed that the Epicureans\u2019 concern\nis with our control over character development, which Epicurus\ndiscusses in On Nature book 25, not free will (Furley 1967;\nBobzien 2000). If determinism were true, how we develop would be\nnecessitated\u2014our current character would be the inevitable\nresult of eternal chains of cause and effect, and traceable entirely\nto external factors of environment and heredity beyond our control.\nLucretius is referring to this threat when he talks about the\n\u201cinternal necessity\u201d that the swerve saves us from by\nbreaking the chains of cause and effect. Once again, however,\nLucretius\u2019 concern when he describes the swerve does not seem to\nbe the ability of humans to shape their own character development, or\nthe way determinism may threaten it. And leaving that worry aside,\nhaving the process of character development caused in part by random\natomic swerves seems no better than having it caused entirely by\ndeterministic atomic motions, as far as our control over it. What is\nneeded is not to falsify determinism, but to preserve our ability to\nuse our reason to change ourselves.\n2.4.3 The self and emergence\n\nIn On Nature 25, Epicurus says that how we develop depends on\nus, and not on the nature of our atoms. Based on this assertion and\nsome other passages in On Nature 25, David Sedley (1983,\n1988) argues that Epicurus believes that how we act is not determined by\nthe atoms that make up our minds. Instead, from complex atomic systems\nlike the atoms that makes up our minds, there emerges human reason,\nour desires, and other psychological entities, which cannot be\nidentified with atomic states. All together, these entities make up\nthe person, or the self. According to Sedley, Epicurus thinks that the\nself acquires causal powers that transcend the laws that bind atomic\nmotion and that can even \u201creach down\u201d and cause changes to the\natoms that make up my mind, and thereby initiate actions. However, the\nself would not be able to exercise this power if physical laws were\nsufficient on their own to determine all atomic motions. As a minimal\nindeterminacy at the atomic level, the swerve allows the self\n\u201celbow room\u201d where it can exercise its power to act one\nway or the other within the laws of physics, but in a way\nthat is not determined by the laws of physics.\n\nOn Nature 25, however, is extremely unclear. The\nbetter-preserved and clearer texts we have by the Epicureans that deal\nwith their philosophy of mind, such as On the Nature of\nThings and The Letter to Herodotus (Epicurus\u2019\nsummary of his physics) seem to support an identity theory of\nmind\u2014that the mind is just a bodily organ (like the brain, but\nlocated in the chest), and that psychological states and events are\nthe same as atomic states and events. The passages cited to support an\n\u201cemergent self\u201d do not obviously commit Epicurus to the\nposition, and they can be read in a way that is consistent with an\nidentity theory of mind. And even if Epicurus did believe in an\nemergent self that acquires causal powers that transcend the powers of\nthe atoms, he would not need to posit the swerve. The \u201claws of\nphysics\u201d simply sum up the effects of a number of causal factors\nthat determine how an atom will move, like its weight and its\ncollisions with other atoms. If there really were an emergent and transcendent self, that self would add another causal factor that could\nmove the atoms. There doesn\u2019t need to be an antecedent\nindeterminacy to ensure that the atoms can be moved by the self. In\nhis solution to the fatalist \u201clazy argument\u201d (see section\n1.3), Carneades says something along these lines: once we have a\n\u201cvoluntary motion of the mind\u201d that obeys us, we do not\nneed a random swerve to help ensure our freedom.\n2.4.4 Bivalence and the swerve\n\nFinally, the swerve may do nothing more than fulfill the function,\ndescribed above, that Cicero gives to it in On\nFate\u2014because of the swerve, statements about what will\nhappen in the future are, at present, neither true nor false. And so,\nwhat will happen is not inevitable, and our deliberations about what\nto do and our actions are not futile (O\u2019Keefe 2005). This fits\nwith Lucretius\u2019 description of how determinism threatens our\nlibera voluntas\u2014if each motion were linked to a prior\nmotion from eternity, animals would not be able to do what they want\nto do and to advance wherever pleasure leads them. So the swerve is\nnot directly involved in the production of free action, it simply\nhelps dispose of one threat to our freedom, the one spelled out by the\nfatalist argument: if the Principle of Bivalence were true, and\napplied to statements about the future, the future would be\nnecessitated, and we would be helpless.\n\nHowever, the Epicureans need not have such concerns about the\nPrinciple of Bivalence. If the Stoics are right, neither the Principle\nof Bivalence nor causal determinism would rob us of freedom, since\naction and deliberation can still be effective even if the Principle\nof Bivalence holds and causal determinism is true. However, if one is\nnot convinced by the Stoics, then Carneades\u2019 position seems more\ncogent than Epicurus\u2019. To secure our ability to shape the\nfuture, what matters is our ability to control our actions in a way\nthat is not causally predetermined\u2014Carneades\u2019\n\u201cvoluntary motion of the mind\u201d\u2014whereas positing a\nrandom atomic motion to falsify a logical principle is beside the\npoint. And if the swerve has no direct role either in the production\nof action or the formation of our character, it is unclear what\nLucretius might be referring to when he says that the swerve saves us\nfrom \u201cinternal necessity\u201d.\n\nNo matter which interpretation is correct, it looks like introducing\nan atomic swerve to preserve our freedom was not a good idea.\n2.5 The Stoics on what is \u201cup to us\u201d, the principle of alternate possibilities, and punishment\n\nThe Stoics are materialists, and they believe that every action we\nperform is causally determined by god as part of his divine plan. This\nmight seem to make us helpless puppets of god, puppets who cannot rightly be held responsible for what we do. The Stoics, however, develop\na theory of animal behavior generally and human action in particular\nthat tries to counter this suspicion. Like both Aristotle and\nEpicurus, for the Stoics, the possession of reason is key to making humans responsible\nfor their actions.\n\nAccording to the Stoics, inanimate objects like logs and stones are\nmoved around from the outside. Animals, however, move themselves\naround. Animal motion has an internal source, the animal\u2019s own\nmind, which is a material, bodily organ. The Stoics\u2019 distinction\nbetween inanimate and animate motion is reminiscent of\nLucretius\u2019 distinction between the passive way inanimate objects\nare moved around, compared to the active motion of animals, which have\nlibera voluntas and can move themselves around as they wish.\nThe Stoics, however, believe that animals moving themselves around is\ncompatible with the way in which animals move being causally\ndetermined. Animals move themselves when an impression occurs which\narouses an impulse. For instance, a hungry dog may see a hunk of meat,\nand this arouses an impulse to run up to the meat and eat it. The\nimpulse is triggered by the impression, but this is still a case of\nthe dog moving itself toward the meat, not merely being passively\npushed around by the impression.\n\nIn the case of rational animals, like humans, there is a crucial\nadditional step. We have \n\n\nreason, which passes judgment on impressions, rejecting some of these\nand accepting others, in order that the animal may be guided\naccordingly. (Origen, On principles 3.1.2\u20133, LS 53A) \n\n\nFor instance, I may see a pulled-pork sandwich in front of me when I\nam hungry. But instead of saying, \u201cMmmm, looks good\u201d, and\nstraightaway gobbling it down, I think \u201cEating meat produced by\nfactory farms would be wrong\u201d and refrain. On the other hand,\nChrysippus believes that animals are made for the sake for human\nbeings\u2014for instance, that appetizing pigs have no purpose other\nthan slaughter and that god created them as part of our cuisine\n(Porphyry, On Abstinence, 3.20.1, 3, LS 54P). And so, given\nhis foolish and vicious views about the moral status of animals,\nChrysippus would gladly decide to chow down on a pulled-pork\nsandwich.\n\nAny action proper will include this step of assent to an impression\nthat leads to an impulse, and it is this additional step that\ndistinguishes human action from mere animal behavior. This does not\nmean that actions require extended and self-conscious deliberation. If\nyou insult my hipster sideburns and I straightaway get angry and punch\nyou in the face, I have assented to the impression that you have\nwronged me and it would be good to retaliate and cause you pain, even\nthough I haven\u2019t thought it over carefully.\n\nTo illustrate the Stoic doctrine of the internal source of animal\nmotion Chrysippus uses the analogy of a stone cylinder rolling down a\nslope. The cylinder\u2019s rolling down the slope may require an\ninitial shove. But that initial shove only triggers the motion, and\nthe primary cause of the motion is the cylinder\u2019s own shape and\n\u201crollability\u201d. Likewise, human action may require an\ninitial impression as its trigger, but how a person acts depends on\nthe person themself, on the sort of person they are and how they\nrespond to their impressions (Cicero, Fat. 39\u201343, LS\n62C).\n\nAssent is up to us and under our control, and assent is the cause\nof our actions. Therefore, our actions are attributable to us, and we\nare rightly held responsible for them. I do not control whether I am\nhealthy, although I can aim at maintaining my health. I do not\ncontrol whether other people hurl insults at me, but it is up to me\nwhether I react angrily when I am insulted. What we do is controlled\nby our will and intellect, and the misdeeds of bad people can rightly\nbe attributed to their own vice (Gellius, Noctes Atticae,\n7.2.6\u201313, LS 62D).\n\nThe Stoics reject the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP). We\ndon\u2019t have \n\n\nthe freedom to choose between opposite actions \u2026 [instead], it\nis what comes about through us that is up to us. (Alexander,\nOn fate ch. 13, 181,13, LS 62G1) \n\n\nAssent is up to us and under our control, and we are rightly\nheld responsible for what we do, even though we do not have the\nability to do otherwise than we do. If we accept PAP, then the actions\nof the virtuous person will be praiseworthy only if they are capable\nof acting in a way other than how they do act. But the truly virtuous\nperson is incapable of acting viciously, of doing anything wrong.\nImagine that I am a virtuous person, and that I have promised my young\ndaughter a piece of cake if she finishes her dinner. She finishes her\ndinner and asks for the cake. There is only one action that I can and\nwill do in that particular situation: give her the cake as promised.\nLet us suppose that there was some small chance that I would\nnot keep my promise\u2014that I\u2019d pretend to look for the cake\nand not find it, and lie to her about its being missing, so that I\ncould have it for myself later. If I were capable of depriving my\ndaughter of her promised cake so that I could chow down on it later,\nthen I would not really be a virtuous person. There would have to be\nsomething wrong with me. And so if we accept PAP, we would have to\naccept the absurd result that we should not praise virtuous people for\nacting virtuously, as they cannot do anything other than the virtuous\naction in any situation. And so, we should reject PAP (Alexander,\nOn fate ch. 26, 196,24\u2013197,3, LS 61M).\n\nAristotle would say that the virtuous person will not break\ntheir promise to their daughter, but that they are capable of\ndoing so. The Stoics reject this response. Virtue is a reliable\ndisposition to do what one should. I am not forced to get the\ncake for my daughter, but if I am truly a good person, I am incapable\nof doing otherwise, because I cannot but want to get her the cake\n(Seneca On Benefits 6.21.2\u20133). The Stoics conceive of virtue\nas a kind as practical skill that allows a person to live well, and\nthe wise person will consistently exercise this skill, so that\neverything they do they do well (Stobaeus Eclogues\n2.66,14\u201367,4, LS 61G). So an \u201cability\u201d to break my promise\nto my daughter is something I do not want to have, as it would be a\ndefect, a form of folly, and a disability.\n\nThe Stoics believe that their doctrine that god causally determines\nour every action is compatible with all of our ordinary moral\npractices. They share with Aristotle the idea that virtue is a\nperfection of our nature as rational and social animals, and they\nbelieve that the proper action to perform is the one that can be given\na reasonable justification. (See the texts in Long and Sedley sections\n59\u201361.) Let us suppose that causal determinism is true and that I\nbreak my promise to my daughter and chow down on the cake. Even if\nevery action is causally determined by God, right reason still\ncommands right actions and prohibits wrong ones. We can still give the\nreasons why breaking my promise to my daughter is irrational and\nwrong, and why keeping my promise would be rational and right. So,\neven though I was causally determined to break my promise, my doing so\nwas wrong. And if there are right and wrong actions, there are also\nvirtues and vices, character traits that dispose us to act rightly and\nwrongly, respectively. So, in the example above, I am a vicious\nperson: I am the kind of person who will break his promise to his\ndaughter for the sake of filling his belly. But virtue is noble, and\nthus commendable, whereas vice is shameful, and thus reprehensible.\nAnd commendable things deserve honor, whereas reprehensible things\ndeserve censure and punishment. So I am a shameful, reprehensible\nperson, and I am rightly criticized for my action (Alexander, On\nFate ch. 35, 207, 5\u201321, LS 62J).\n\nWhile the Stoics think that vicious people are responsible for what\nthey do, and that wrongdoing merits censure and punishment, they\nreject retributive punishment, punishment that seeks to set back a\nperson\u2019s interests as fitting payback for the wrong they have\ndone. Like god, the virtuous person wishes to harm none and to benefit\nall. We should regard ourselves as akin to all human beings, and we\nshould seek to benefit as many people as we can (Cicero Fin.\n3.62\u20138, LS 57F). Punishment is a fitting response to wrongdoing, but\nright punishment is rehabilitative, a loving correction of\nthe person punished (Alexander, On fate ch. 35, 207,5\u201321, LS\n62J). The model here is akin to parental discipline. If my sons are\nsquabbling, and one of them angrily hits the other, I might send him\nto time-out, deprive him of dessert, and ground him for a week. But I\ndo not do so because I want my son to suffer or I think he had it\ncoming to him. Instead, while my son might find the punishment\npainful, I inflict the punishment because I think that the discipline\nwill be good for him, that it will help him realize that he has done something\nwrong and that he needs to change himself. In their theory of\npunishment, as in much of their ethical theory, the Stoics are\nfollowing the lead of Plato, who also rejects retributive punishment\nin favor of rehabilitative punishment. (See in particular\nProtagoras 323d-324d and Gorgias 472d-479e.) Plato,\nhowever, rejects retribution in part because he believes that all\nwrongdoing is due to ignorance of what is good. Hence, he thinks,\nnobody does wrong willingly, and nobody is deserving of retributive\npunishment.\n\nAccording to the Stoics, both the virtuous, wise person and the\nvicious fool are responsible for their actions, because the actions of\neach of them are equally a result of their assent, which is under\ntheir control. Nonetheless, in another sense, only the wise person is\ntruly free (DL 7.33). The later Stoic Epictetus often compares the\nfoolish person to a slave, under the yolk of vicious and damaging\ndesires (for instance, Handbook 14 and Discourses\n2.2). Similarly, the Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius likens the fool to\na puppet who is jerked here and there by irrational impulses (for\ninstance, Meditations 2.2, 6.16). The fool is dominated by\ndesires and beliefs that are alien to his nature as a rational being,\nbecause right reason commands all virtuous actions and forbids all\nvicious actions. Only the wise person is free from these alienating\nand disturbing desires and beliefs; only the wise person has mastered\nhimself and is in harmony with himself.\n 2.6 Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019 incompatibilist Aristotelianism\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias is an adherent of Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy, best known for his extensive commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s texts. In his treatise On Fate, Alexander\ndevelops an Aristotelian theory on human freedom in reaction to the\nStoics\u2019 clearly determinist and compatibilist theory.\nAlexander\u2019s theory is based on what Aristotle says, and he\nclaims simply to be presenting Aristotle\u2019s views. But\nAlexander\u2019s treatment takes many elements of Aristotle, which on\ntheir own can be read as either compatible with causal determinism or\nincompatible with causal determinism, and develops them in\nincompatibilist ways. Alexander thinks that causal determinism is\nincompatible both with effective deliberation and with the sort of\ncontrol over our actions needed for moral responsibility.\n\nThe Stoics identify fate with the causal organization of the cosmos.\nEvery thing that occurs has a cause which is sufficient to produce\nexactly that outcome. And given the totality of circumstances, it is\ncausally impossible for things not to turn out the particular way that\nthey do (Alexander, On Fate ch. 22). Alexander believes that\nhaving things causally determined by fate in this way is incompatible\nwith some outcomes being contingent. On the Stoic position, if there\nis going to be a sea battle tomorrow, the causal structure of the\ncosmos guarantees that there will be a sea battle tomorrow and makes\nit impossible that there not be a sea battle tomorrow (Alexander,\nOn Fate ch. 9). But deliberating about things that will\nnecessarily occur or necessarily not occur is pointless; it makes\nsense to deliberate only about things that can either possibly occur\nor not. Furthermore, if I deliberate about whether to instigate a sea\nbattle or not, it makes sense to do so only if I have the ability\neither to instigate a sea battle or not to do so. I do not deliberate\nwhether or not to fly if I cannot fly, or if I must fly\n(Alexander, On Fate ch. 11\u201312). So, effective deliberation\nrequires that a person have the ability to do otherwise than they do,\nand Alexander thinks that such an ability is incompatible with causal\ndeterminism.\n\nAlexander also believes that the Stoic position implies that our\nactions are not really \u201cup to us\u201d, i.e., that we do not\nhave the sort of control over our actions which is required to be\nrightly praised, blamed, rewarded, or punished for them. Alexander\nthinks this because he subscribes to something like the principle that\n\u201cought implies can\u201d, i.e., that a person can be morally\nobligated to do something only if they have the ability to do it. This\nis shown in our own case, when we feel regret and blame ourselves for\ndoing something because we think we were able not to choose to do the\nevil thing we had done (Alexander, On Fate ch. 12,\n180.29\u201331). And in the case of other people, too, we blame and punish\nthem on the assumption that they were able to refrain from wrongdoing.\nIf they had to do what they did, under the circumstances, they are\nblameless. (Alexander thinks that it is inadequate to say that they\nwould have acted differently if circumstances had been different;\nAlexander, On Fate ch. 16.)\n\nAlexander turns Chrysippus\u2019 analogy of the cylinder rolling down\nthe slope against the Stoic position. Chrysippus says that, while an\ninitial shove is required to get the cylinder moving, whether and how\nthe cylinder rolls depends on its shape, and likewise, while an\ninitial impression is needed to get a person moving, how they respond\nto the impression depends on the type of person they are, and thus\nthey are responsible for how they act. But, says Alexander, round\nthings must roll down a slope when shoved; it is not up to them\nwhether or not to roll. Instead, they are compelled to roll by a kind\nof internal necessity. And if the Stoics are right, vicious people are\nlikewise compelled by their vicious natures, by a kind of internal\nnecessity, to do their evil deeds (Alexander, On Fate ch.\n17).\n\nLike Carneades, Alexander believes that his own doctrine of free\nchoice doesn\u2019t introduce motion without a cause. A person has\nvarious motives they can act on: they may want to obtain this pleasure\nor that one, or to get something that they believe is to their\nadvantage, or to do something because they think it\u2019s the right\nthing to do. Nothing predetermines or necessitates what the person\nwill end up freely choosing to do: they might accept this job or that\none, given the competing considerations in favor of each, and they can\nvalue the pleasure of cake over the importance of keeping their\npromises, or vice-versa. But no matter what they end up choosing, they\nare the cause of their own choices and of the actions that result from\nthem (Alexander, On Fate ch. 15).\n\nBut what about the thoroughly virtuous person? Alexander agrees with\nthe Stoics that virtuous people are psychologically incapable of doing\nanything vicious. However, it does not follow that every action they\nperform is causally necessitated. There is often a range of available\nactions that are consistent with virtue, or some leeway in the\nprecise way in which they may do the action which virtue requires, and\nit is up to them which of these options they choose (Alexander, On\nFate ch. 29). Alexander also follows Aristotle in thinking that\npeople are responsible for developing their character through their\nown voluntary actions, in a way analogous to developing skills through\npractice. This, thinks Alexander, distinguishes virtuous humans from\nthe gods. Humans are not by nature virtuous. Instead, they have to\ndevelop their virtue, and they are capable of either becoming virtuous\nor not. And so, we praise the person who develops the virtues, because\nthe type of person they became was up to them. But the gods\nnecessarily possess their goodness as a kind of natural gift, and they\nare incapable of becoming bad. And so, because their goodness was not\nup to them, we rightly honor the gods for their goodness, but we do not\npraise them (Alexander, On Fate chs. 27, 32).\n 2.7 Plotinus on freedom and the good\n\nPlotinus is a follower of Plato, and in his attempt to spell out\nsystematically the truths contained in Plato\u2019s dialogues, he\nfounded the philosophical movement nowadays called Neoplatonism. He\ndevelops a distinctive position on human freedom, one that overlaps\nconsiderably with the Stoics\u2019 position. However, because of his\ndeep metaphysical differences with the Stoics, he breaks with them on\nthe role of fate in producing human action.\n\nFor Plotinus, to say that something is \u201cup to us\u201d is to\nsay that we have power or mastery over it. He contrasts this mastery\nwith servitude or slavery. True power is the power to do what we wish,\nin order to gain what we desire. So Plotinus thinks that a person who\nacts under compulsion is not acting freely. He also agrees with\nAristotle that a person who acts in ignorance of the particulars of\nhis situation is not acting voluntarily: if I inadvertently poison my\nmother with cyanide-laced Tylenol, I am not doing what I wished to do,\nas I did not wish to poison my mother. But he disagrees with\nAristotle, and agrees with Plato, in thinking that ignorance of the\nrightness or wrongness of what I propose to do excuses (Enn.\nVI.8[39].1). Plotinus believes that all desire is desire for the good\n(Enn. VI.8[39].7). If I poison my mother, I do so because I\nbelieve that doing so is good for me. But if I\u2019m wrong about\nthat, then when I kill her, I\u2019m not really gaining what I\ndesire, because I wanted to get what was good for me. (It\u2019s for\nthese sorts of reasons that Plato, in Gorgias 466c-468e,\ndenies that a tyrant who is able to kill, torture, or imprison anybody\nas he sees fit has great power. Power enables a person to get what\nthey desire, which is what is good for them, and the tyrant\u2019s\nso-called \u201cpower\u201d actually harms him.)\n\nFollowing Plato in the Republic, Plotinus repeatedly asserts\nthat for the mind to be controlled by the appetites or passions is a\nkind of slavery, because the mind is being controlled by something\noutside of itself (Enn. VI.8[39].2, VI.8[39].3). Reason\nshould rule the person, and an action is free if it proceeds from\nknowledge (Enn. VI.8[39].1, VI.8[39].6). So Plotinus joins\nthe Stoics in thinking that only the wise person is free.\n\u201cFreedom\u201d in this sense is primarily an ethical ideal, not\na condition on moral responsibility.\n\nBecause freedom is a power to obtain what is truly good for yourself,\nPlotinus also joins the Stoics in rejecting the principle that, in\norder to be in control of what you do, you must have the ability to do\notherwise than you do. Let us imagine that my daughter has a serious\nheart condition, and after researching the options to repair her\nheart, I follow the correct course of action, both because I love her\nand because I recognize that doing so is also good for me. If my\nreason is in charge of what I do, and I know that what I am doing is\nfor the best, then I am incapable of not doing what I do. But it not\nsome lack of power or external obstacle that prevents me from\nneglecting my daughter and doing what is worse. Instead, my action is\nan expression of my knowledge and my will, and that is why I cannot do\notherwise (Enn. VI.8[39].10). Likewise, Plotinus thinks it\nwould be perverse to say that I am forced or compelled to help my\ndaughter, that my action is involuntary because it springs from some\nsort of \u201cinternal necessity\u201d. Instead, an action is free\nwhen it is directed towards a good that you recognize, and slavery\nconsists in being powerless to move towards your good. This is the\nkind of freedom enjoyed by the divine intellect. Plotinus believes\nthat the Form of the Good, as described in places like book 6 of\nPlato\u2019s Republic, is the transcendent source of\neverything that exists. (Plotinus sometimes calls it the One, to\nstress its simplicity.) The divine intellect fully understands and\neternally contemplates the Good, and it does so freely\u2014for why\nwould it not do so? (Enn. VI.8[39].4)\n\nPlotinus wants to allow the wise person untrammeled mastery, and so he\nrestricts the scope of their freedom to their reasoning and will, and\nnot, strictly speaking, to their actions. If I am wise, I have control\nover my reasoning and the decisions I make on account of my reasoning.\nBut which actions I perform are not entirely up to me, but depend on\nexternal circumstances beyond my control. If I am a brave person, I\nwill stand ready to risk my life in war for a noble cause, but such a\nwar may never arise. And of course, the effects of my actions are not\nup to me\u2014perhaps my daughter will die of her heart condition\ndespite my best efforts (Enn. VI.8[39].5). However, because\nhappiness consists in wisdom and virtue, the wise person\u2019s\ninability to entirely control their actions or their actions\u2019\neffects does nothing to prevent them from having the sort of power\nthat matters\u2014the power to obtain what is good. This aspect of\nPlotinus\u2019 thought echoes the Roman Stoic Epictetus. In order to\nbe happy, says Epictetus, we must distinguish between what is up to us\nand what is not, and the one thing that god has placed under our\ncontrol is the correct use of impressions i.e., to decide rightly what\nto believe and what to do (Epictetus, Discourses 1.1.7\u201312, LS\n62K). Because Epictetus thinks that freedom consists in our control\nover an internal power of assent, Frede (2011) claims that the notion\nof a \u201cfree will\u201d first appears in Epictetus.\n\nDespite the considerable overlap between Plotinus and the Stoics on\nfreedom, they differ significantly on fate. The Stoics think that\ngod\u2019s mind is a fiery breath. It is a material substance that\npervades the cosmos and causally determines every event that will\noccur through its organization of the cosmos, which includes the\nmatter that makes up our own minds. The motions in the cosmos, then,\nare the result of both the operations of matter and\nof reason. Plotinus, on the other hand, distinguishes the causal\ninfluences of matter and of mind. The One, the divine intellect, soul,\nand our intellects are all immaterial, and bodies are the lowest form\nof beings. For Plotinus, any purely materialistic metaphysics, such as\nthe Epicureans\u2019 scheme of atoms moving in the void, cannot\nexplain the operations of mind, which stands above matter\n(Enn. III.1[3].3).\n\nPlotinus criticizes the Stoics because, on their theory, humans and\ntheir minds are parts of god, and god works his will through human\nactions. Plotinus believes that, if this were true, our decisions\nwould be caused by something outside of ourselves and would not really\nbe our own\u2014we would not be agents any more than our feet are,\nwhen we use them to kick something. (The Stoics would reply that\nhumans both move themselves and are moved by god through\nfate.) Furthermore, the Stoics\u2019 theory has the unacceptable\nresult of making god the cause of evil, when humans act wrongly\n(Enn. III.1[3].4). Instead, says Plotinus, we should hold\nthat human minds are genuinely separate things, and that they are\nself-movers, the cause of their own thoughts and decisions\n(Enn. III.1[3].4, III.1[3].8, III.2[47].7). Here, Plotinus\nagain follows Plato, who in his creation-myth the Timaeus\nasserts that human souls are distinct from the world-soul that\nanimates the cosmos (Tim. 41d).\n\nFor Plotinus, wrongdoing is involuntary, because it is always due to\nignorance, but the evil person is still its cause (Enn.\nIII.2[47].10). The wrongdoer is not culpable for what they do, but\nthey still suffer two sorts of punishments\u2014although these\npunishments might better be called \u201cconsequences\u201d. The\nfirst penalty they pay for their wrongdoing is becoming evil, which is\nbad for them (Enn. III.2[47].4; III.2[47].8; cf. Plato,\nLaws 728b-c). Secondly, our behavior in this life will have\nan impact on how we will fare in our future lives. Plotinus believes\nin a cycle of reincarnation in which past wrongs lead to future\nsuffering (Enn. III.2[47].12). Furthermore, the choices a\nperson makes within this life will determine the sort of animal (or\nplant) they are reincarnated as, with those who maintain the human\nlevel becoming humans once again, whereas those dominated by passions\nor appetites reincarnated as an appropriate sort of animal or plant\n(Enn. III.4[15].2).\n\nPlotinus develops his theory of reincarnation as a reading of\nPlato\u2019s Myth of Er, which closes the Republic\n(Rep. 614b-621d). In the Myth, disembodied souls between\ncycles of reincarnation have a variety of lives to choose between.\nWhich life they choose is entirely up to them, and the gods are not to\nblame. However, once they choose a particular life, they are bound by\nnecessity to that life and to the events within that life\u2014for\ninstance, a greedy soul chooses the life of a tyrant without examining\nit closely, only to realize after his choice that he is fated to eat\nhis children. On a literal reading, the myth seems to confine control\nover what will happen within one\u2019s life to the choice one makes\nprior to that life, as a disembodied soul. But Plotinus thinks that\nthe Myth is an allegory for how all of the soul\u2019s choices in\nthis life shape what will happen to it in the future (Enn.\nIII.4[15].3; III.4[15].5). It is better to be incarnated in some\nbodies rather than others\u2014it is better to be a human rather than\na wolf, and some humans have bodily temperaments more conducive to\ngoodness than others. Nonetheless, the body one is incarnated into\ndoes not determine what one will do; it is up to the soul what it will\ndo given the opportunities available to it within that life\n(Enn. III.4[15].5).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary texts in translation", "Primary texts cited", "Secondary sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary texts in translation": ["</h3>\n<p>\nTranslations of Aristotle are from Barnes (1984), and of other texts\nare from Long and Sedley (1987).
