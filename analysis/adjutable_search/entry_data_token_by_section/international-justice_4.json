    "main_text": "Varieties of Institutionalism || The Basic Structure as Cooperative Interdependence\n3.2 The Basic Structure as Cooperative Interdependence\n\nLeft institutionalists are distinguished from right institutionalists\nin three ways. First, left institutionalists tend to argue for more\nrobust distributive obligations that operate directly on the\ninstitutions that characterize international politics. Second, they\ntend to reject a strongly bifurcated view of the differences between\ninternational and domestic justice, some arguing that there is no\ndifference, others arguing that there are many institutional contexts\nthat give rise to distributive obligations, and still others claiming\nthat domestic and international institutional contexts, and their\ncorresponding principles of distributive justice, operate on a smooth\ncontinuum. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, left\ninstitutionalists reject the right institutionalist emphasis on\ncoercion in activating claims of distributive justice. To the\ncontrary, left institutionalists typically characterize the basic\nstructure in terms of cooperation, the provision of basic goods, or\neconomic interdependence (Sangiovanni 2007: 19\u201320).\n\nWe have already examined some early left institutionalist responses\nabove. We will, here, consider some more recent extensions of the\nview. These thinkers generally accept that the state\u2014with its\ncoercive legal apparatus\u2014gives rise to especially stringent\ndemands of distributive justice. However, they argue that the nature\nof the global economic system also gives rise to robust\ndistributive obligations. These distributive obligations arise\ndirectly in virtue of the institutional features of the\nglobal economic system irrespective of their effects on domestic\njustice. What differentiates them from the early, more radical left\ninstitutionalist thinkers, is that they recognize and accept that\ndistinct norms of egalitarian concern might be appropriate in the\ndomestic and global contexts. Moderate left institutionalists then\naccept with Rawls a two-tiered account of global justice; they differ\nfrom right institutionalists (and from Rawls) in arguing that distinct\nnorms of distributive justice apply to individuals at the global\nlevel.\n\nModerate left institutionalists generally present some view as to what\nactivates these distributive obligations. Darrell Moellendorf (2011),\nfor example, offers the following, jointly sufficient criteria:\n\n\nThe version of membership dependence that I affirm is based upon what\nI term the principle of associational justice. The idea is\nthat duties of social justice exist between persons who have a moral\nduty of equal respect to one another if those persons are co-members\nin an association that is (1) relatively strong, (2) largely\nnonvoluntary, (3) constitutive of a significant part of the background\nrules for the various relationships of their public lives, and (4)\ngoverned by norms that can be subject to human control. (2011:\n537)\n\n\nCohen and Sabel (2006) have offered three distinct principles by which\nthese distributive duties might be justified. Andrea Sangiovanni\n(2007), despite the fact that his view has much in common with right\ninstitutionalisn, presents a left-oriented view because his account of\ninternational distributive justice is both non-coercive and\ndirect:\n\n\nI will argue that equality is a relational ideal of\nreciprocity among those who support and maintain the\nstate\u2019s capacity to provide the basic collective goods necessary\nto protect us from physical attack and to maintain a stable system of\nproperty rights and entitlements. (Sangiovanni 2007: 19\u201320)\n\n\nThese views can all be used to directly evaluate global inequalities.\nHowever, unlike the more extreme left institutionalism of early Beitz\nand Pogge, each view produces comparatively less egalitarian results\nat the global level. Moellendorf argues that, even though both the\nglobal economic system and the state satisfy all four criteria, the\nformer activates obligations of \u201creciprocity\u201d while the\nlatter activates the obligations of \u201cinclusive and equal\ncitizenship\u201d. Cohen and Sabel argue that the state requires\nliberal egalitarianism while international institutions create\nobligations of \u201cinclusion\u201d. In both cases, the obligations\nat the global level are less robust than at the domestic. Similarly,\nSangiovanni argues that the provision of collective goods generates an\nobligation of reciprocity, understood as egalitarian shares. The\nglobal economic system gives rise to distributive obligations, but the\nscope of the obligation is limited to the public goods produced by the\nsystem itself, in the event it comes to produce them (whether it\ncurrently does so is a matter of controversy). This means that\nSangiovanni\u2019s account could be indifferent to considerable\ninequality among citizens of different countries as long as\nreciprocity held within each country and obtained in the contribution\nto a system of physical and economic rights made by the\ninternational system. What is important to note about moderate\nleft institutionalism, and what distinguishes it from the more extreme\nversion, is that moderates seek robust principles of distributive\njustice that apply to the particular domain of the global that are of\na piece with the principles of distributive justice domestically but\nare nonetheless sensitive to the differences between the two\ndomains.\n\nModerate left institutionalist views are considerably more diverse\nwhen compared to moderate right institutionalists: there is no central\nconcept\u2014like coercion\u2014that binds them together. And\nmoderate left institutionalism, as a view that is responsive to the\nparticular features of international institutions, has much to\nrecommend it. However, there are some areas of concern. First, one\nmight worry that many left institutionalist arguments import notions\nof coercion into their view. Moellendorf makes\n\u201cnon-voluntariness\u201d one of the criteria of distributively\nrelevant institutions, which seems to imply that individuals or states\nthat don\u2019t wish to participate in the global economy will be\ncoerced into doing so, generally by threat of economic catastrophe.\nSimilarly, Cohen and Sabel present their three \u201cweak\u201d\nnon-coercive accounts of when obligations of distributive justice are\nactivated, but their argument that the WTO should invoke norms of\ninclusion is based\u2014at least partly\u2014on the fact that the\nWTO can issue coercive threats. Sangiovanni discusses the provision of\npublic goods, which may seem non-coercive, but if these public goods\nare necessary for even minimally decent lives, then it seems that the\nthreat of their non-provision could very well be a coercive one. To\nput it another way, is it really the case that economic cooperation\nthrough trade\u2014even institutionalized in order to solve\ncoordination problems\u2014is ever enough to invoke norms of\ndistributive justice if there is no chance that that economic\ncooperation, no matter how unequally distributed, will undermine the\npossibility of the participants to live decent lives? The worry here\nis that left institutionalists might be begging the question by\ncovertly assuming that the international system is indeed coercive,\nwill remain coercive even if reformed, and is coercive in precisely\nway needed to generate obligations of distributive justice. Left\ninstitutionalists, therefore, are quite adept at identifying\ninjustices in the international arena, but they are less persuasive at\nshowing that the appropriate normative response to these wrongs is to\nhave the international system be governed by principles of\ndistributive justice. For example, suppose Moellendorf is correct that\nthe WTO wrongly forces an inappropriate development model on weak and\nfailing nations that serves the rich and powerful while undermining\nthe ability of those nations to become democratically well-ordered.\nCertainly the right response to recognizing this wrong is to have the\nWTO cease that unjust behavior. It is hard to see why we\nwould need the more robust norm of distributive equality to understand\nthe wrongness of the WTO\u2019s behavior.\n",
