    "main_text": "The Law of Peoples: Liberal Foreign Policy\n5. The Law of Peoples: Liberal Foreign Policy\n\nWith the theories of legitimacy and justice for a self-contained\nliberal society completed, Rawls then extends his approach to\ninternational relations with the next in his sequence of theories: the\nlaw of peoples.\n\nRawls assumes that no tolerable world state could be stable. He cites\nKant in asserting that a world government would either be a global\ndespotism or beleaguered by groups fighting to gain their political\nindependence. So the law of peoples will be international, not\ncosmopolitan: it will be a foreign policy that guides a liberal\nsociety in its interactions with other societies, both liberal and\nnon-liberal.\n\nRawls describes the main ideas motivating his law of peoples as\nfollows:\n\nTwo main ideas motivate the Law of Peoples. One is that the great\nevils of human history\u2014unjust war and oppression, religious\npersecution and the denial of liberty of conscience, starvation and\npoverty, not to mention genocide and mass murder\u2014follow from\npolitical injustice, with its own cruelties and callousness\u2026\nThe other main idea, obviously connected with the first, is that, once\nthe gravest forms of political injustice are eliminated by following\njust (or at least decent) social policies and establishing just (or at\nleast decent) basic institutions, these great evils will eventually\ndisappear (LP, 6\u20137).\n\n\nThe most important feature of the \u201crealistic utopia\u201d that\nRawls envisages in The Law of Peoples is that the great evils\nof human history no longer occur. The most important condition for\nthis realistic utopia to come about is that all societies are\ninternally well-ordered: that all have just, or at least decent,\ndomestic political institutions.\n",
