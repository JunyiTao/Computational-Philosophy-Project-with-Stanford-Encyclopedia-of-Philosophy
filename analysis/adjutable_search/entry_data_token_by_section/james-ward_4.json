    "main_text": "Natural Theology\n5. Natural Theology\n\n\nAs in the rest of his philosophy, evolutionary theory also looms large\nin Ward\u2019s natural theology. The existence of God, Ward frankly\nrecognizes, cannot be proved. However, a theory of interacting monads\ncannot guarantee that the universe will keep moving towards a state of\nincreasing harmony and cohesion: \u201cwithout such a spiritual\ncontinuity as theism alone seems able to ensure,\u201d Ward remarks,\n\u201cit looks as if a pluralistic world were condemned to a\nSisyphean task\u201d (215). At the same time, the worldly monads need\nthe leadership of a supreme agent if harmony has to be widespread\nacross the entire universe.  Accordingly, Ward\u2019s main problem is to\nunderstand how God can be related to the world of monads and guide\nthem towards the realization of societies of ever increasing\nperfections.\n\n\nIt is clear to Ward that there must be an ontological gap between\nGod and the monads. God cannot be a primus inter\npares\u2014only a monad among other monads (as Leibniz\u2019s\nlanguage sometimes suggests). Since God is the world\u2019s ratio\nessendi\u2014its ontological foundation, rather than its creator\nin time\u2014He must be regarded as altogether transcendent. At the\nsame time, since God has to lure the evolutionary process, He cannot\nmerely maintain the world in existence, but must somehow actively enter\ninto it; His relation to the world must therefore involve an aspect of\nimmanence. This gives rise to a dilemma: how could God be both immanent\nand transcendent? Ward can do no better than to provide an analogy in\nwhich God is compared with a Cosmic Artist:\n\n\nWe may discern perhaps a faint and distant analogy\u2026 in what\nwe are wont to style the creations of genius\u2026 the immortal works\nof art, the things of beauty that are a joy forever, we regard\nas\u2026 the spontaneous output of productive imagination, of a free\nspirit that embodies itself in its work, lives in it and loves it.\n(238\u2013239)\n\n\nNeedless to say, this analogy is too \u2018faint and distant\u2019\nto be of any real help.\n\n\nWard strikes an original note in his attempt to accommodate the\nreality of God with epigenesis. Since he believes that novelties could\nonly be generated by the interplay of genuinely free agents, he\nconceives of God as limiting himself in the exercise of his power, so\nas to let the monads free: \u201cUnless creators are created,\u201d\nhe says, \u201cnothing is really created\u201d (437). Having\nrenounced omnipotence, God cannot have knowledge of a future he does\nnot control anymore. This means that the notion of divine\nomniscience\u2014which in the case of Leibniz takes the form of the\ndoctrine of complete concepts\u2014must be abandoned.  God lacks\nknowledge of future contingents; nevertheless, he is aware of all the\npossibilities open to a monad at any moment, so that the future will\nnever come to him as unexpected: \u201cGod, who knows both tendencies\nand possibilities completely, is beyond surprise and his purpose\nbeyond frustration\u201d (479). Clearly, such a God cannot be the\nperfect, immutable God of Leibniz and of classical theism, but is a\ndeveloping God whose knowledge of the world increases with the\nunfolding of cosmic history. How does such a God lure the world\ntowards greater perfection? This question too is left unanswered;\nalways candid, Ward acknowledges that God\u2019s \u201cmodus\noperandi\u2026is to us inscrutable\u201d (479).\n",
