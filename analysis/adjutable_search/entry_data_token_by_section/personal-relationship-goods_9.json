    "main_text": "The Value of Personal Relationship Goods || Necessary to Secure Other Rights\n3.4 Necessary to Secure Other Rights\n\nIf, as the arguments in subsection\n 3.2.\n and\n 3.3.\n indicate, some personal relationship goods are essential for survival\nand health and for developing autonomy, then they are also necessary\nin order to ensure the securing of various (human) rights. This at\nleast will be the case on the interest theory of rights (Brownlee\n2013, forthcoming): If rights protect powerful interests, and if we\nhave powerful interests in surviving, in opportunities to preserve our\nhealth, and to pursue our (reasonable) conception of life etc., then\nour social needs have to be met for our rights to be respected. She\nconcludes this is a reason to believe that we also have an even more\nurgent right to those personal relationship goods that are necessary\nin order to stay alive, remain healthy, develop, and have the physical\nand psychological conditions necessary to pursue any life plans.\n\nNote that the same logic could apply to a theory focused on\nindividuals\u2019 entitlements to certain capabilities or\nfunctionings, rather than to a theory of human rights. Martha Nussbaum\n(2000; 2011: 33\u201334), for instance, believes that some of the\ncore capabilities to which we all have a claim of justice are\ncapabilities for affiliation and emotion. If, indeed, being affiliated\nand enjoying the capacity of forming attachments with others are\npreconditions for achieving other capabilities\u2014such as bodily\nhealth, practical reasoning, or play\u2014then the former are more\nbasic. Similarly, on one view (Wolff & de-Shalit 2007), some forms\nof advantage are \u201cfertile\u201d, in the sense that their\nachievement either conditions or makes more likely the achievement of\nother forms of advantage. In this sense, personal relationship goods\nare \u201cfertile\u201d, provided that the above arguments\nconcerning their instrumental value are correct.\n",
