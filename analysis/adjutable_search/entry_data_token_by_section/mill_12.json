    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Practical Philosophy || Morality\n4.3 Morality\n\nIt is important to note that the claims made so far concern\nMill\u2019s axiology (Fletcher 2008). They concern, that is to say,\nwhat states of affairs are valuable\u2014which outcomes are\ngood. Such axiological claims are, in themselves, silent on\nthe question of our moral obligations. Mill is not a maximizing\nutilitarian about the moral. Although, admittedly, he often makes\nstatements which seem to imply that he is committed to this\nposition\u2014most famously, towards the beginning of\nUtilitarianism, that \u201cactions are right in proportion\nas they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the\nreverse of happiness\u201d (Utilitarianism, X:\n210)\u2014such statements should be understood as simplifying devices\nfor the purposes of initial exposition. Other, more careful,\nstatements clearly show that this is not his considered position.\n\nThe maximizing utilitarian believes that we are morally obliged to\nbring about the most happiness we can\u2014that insofar as\nwe fall short of this mark, we violate our moral obligations. Yet Mill\nclearly believes that we are not obliged to do all that we\ncan upon pain of moral censure.\n\n\nIt is not good that persons should be bound, by other people\u2019s\nopinion, to do everything that they would deserve praise for doing.\nThere is a standard of altruism to which all should be required to\ncome up, and a degree beyond it which is not obligatory, but\nmeritorious. (Auguste Comte and Positivism, X: 337)\n\n\nMill, that is to say, believes in the existence of a class of\nsupererogatory acts (Donner 2009: 140\u20133). While it might be\nextremely praiseworthy to do the most good that we\ncan\u2014and while there might be reason to do the most good\nthat we can\u2014failure to do so is not the standard that marks the\ndistinction between acting morally and immorally. Rather, Mill claims,\nthe notion of moral wrong is connected to that of\npunishment.\n\n\nI think there is no doubt that this distinction lies at the bottom of\nthe notions of right and wrong; that we call any conduct wrong, or\nemploy, instead, some other term of dislike or disparagement,\naccording as we think that the person ought, or ought not, to be\npunished for it. (Utilitarianism, X: 246)\n\n\nMill\u2019s notion of \u2018punishment\u2019, however, is a broad\none.\n\n\nWe do not call anything wrong, unless we mean to imply that a person\nought to be punished in some way or other for doing it; if not by law,\nby the opinion of his fellow creatures; if not by opinion, by the\nreproaches of his own conscience. [\u2026] [If] it is not a case of\nmoral obligation; we do not blame them, that is, we do not think that\nthey are proper objects of punishment. (Utilitarianism, X:\n246)\n\n\nAn act is morally wrong, then, if it is blameworthy, i.e., if\nit would be proper to blame an agent for performing that act.\nThe question, of course, is what grounds such norms of blame.\nInterpreters have in general taken Mill to believe that whether we\nought to blame an individual for any given act\u2014and whether,\ntherefore that act is morally wrong\u2014is determined by\nconsiderations of utilitarian efficiency. An act is wrong, therefore,\nif it would be productive to overall utility to blame an individual\nfor performing that act\u2014or, under a rule-focused interpretation,\nif it would be productive to overall utility for there to exist a rule\nto the effect that individuals performing actions of that sort were\nsubject to\n blame.[5]\n\nThe efficiency of such norms of blame will be dependent, in part, on\nthe culture in which they are to operate\u2014on the dispositions of\nindividuals to react to blame and the promise of blame, and on the\npossibility of inculcating these dispositions in a given\ngroup\u2014and, for this reason, the domain of moral duty will vary\nwith time and place (Auguste Comte, X: 338; Miller 2010: 99).\nA significant remaining question is whether there is a constraint\nplaced on morality by the logic of that emotion: whether, in other\nwords, there are certain actions which, because of the nature of the\nemotion of blame, cannot be regarded as morally wrong (Jacobson\n2008).\n\nMill\u2019s stance on the place of morality in practical reasoning\noverall\u2014how our moral obligations are related to what we ought\nto do, all things considered\u2014is complex. Mill writes that \n\n\nthe moral view of actions and characters [\u2026] is\nunquestionably the first and most important mode of looking at them.\n(Bentham, X: 112) \n\n\nBut, at the same time, he is critical of those\n\u201cmorality-intoxicated\u201d philosophers who take morality to\ncrowd out the sphere of practical reason entirely\u2014who treat the\nmoral dimension of questions about how we should act \u201cas if it\nwere the sole one\u201d (Auguste Comte, X: 336;\nBentham, X: 112). \u201cPractical Reason\u201d\u2014or, as\nMill also terms it, \u201cthe Art of Life\u201d\u2014has as its\nproper object, bringing into existence the greatest possible\n happiness.[6]\n It is divided into three domains: \u201cMorality, Prudence or\nPolicy, and Aesthetics; the Right, the Expedient, and the Beautiful or\nNoble\u201d (System, VIII: 949; cf. Bentham, X:\n112). An action is prudent simply to the extent that it maximizes a\nperson\u2019s individual utility, which can of course be in part a\nfunction of others\u2019 utility; an action is beautiful to the\nextent that it is admirable, and excites aesthetic pleasure in its\ncontemplation (cf. Loizides 2013: 133\u201340).\n\nMoral rules play a role in guiding and evaluating action, to be sure,\nbut so do rules of aesthetics and prudence: these too promote the\ngeneral happiness, and as such provide reasons for action. There can,\nof course, be clashes between such rules of morality, prudence, and\naesthetics\u2014and, indeed, clashes of rules within those\ndomains. In such cases, Mill writes, it is \u201crequisite that first\nprinciples should be appealed to\u201d (Utilitarianism, X:\n226; cf. System, VIII: 951). Mill also allows that appeal be\nmade directly to the principle of utility on occasions when an agent\nknows that following rules\u2014moral, prudential, or\naesthetic\u2014would generate significantly less overall happiness\nthan violating those rules (Utilitarianism, X: 223;\nTaylor\u2019s Statesman XIX: 638\u201340). But Mill is\nunclear as to how often such clashes and exceptions license direct\nappeal to the principle of utility. To the extent that one ought\noften to ignore the rules of morality, prudence, and\naesthetics, and act simply on the basis of which action is most\nchoice-worthy according to the theory of practical reason overall,\nMill is, in the end, pulled towards something which comes to resemble\nan act-utilitarianism position (Turner 2015).\n",
