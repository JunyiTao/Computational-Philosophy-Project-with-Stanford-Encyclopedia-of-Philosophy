    "main_text": "\n\nLeibniz\u2019s place in the history of the philosophy of mind is best\nsecured by his pre-established harmony. In a more popular view,\nthis is the thesis that, roughly, there is no mind-body interaction\nstrictly speaking, for there is only a non-causal relationship of\nharmony, parallelism, or correspondence between mind and body.\nCertainly, the pre-established harmony is important for a proper\nunderstanding of Leibniz\u2019s philosophy of mind. But there is much\nmore to be considered, and even when it comes to the pre-established\nharmony, this more popular view needs to be refined, particularly\ninsofar as it suggests that Leibniz accepts a roughly Cartesian,\nalbeit non-interactionist dualism. He does not accept such a dualism,\nand in fact, Leibniz is justly famous for his critiques not only of\nmaterialism but also of any dualism of this sort. In short, he made\nimportant contributions to a number of classical topics in the\nphilosophy of mind, including materialism, dualism, and mind-body\ninteraction.\n\nBut Leibniz had much to say about the philosophy of mind that goes\nwell beyond these traditionally important topics. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, his system sometimes contains ideas of relevance even to\ncontemporary discussions in the cognitive sciences. More generally, he\ndiscusses in depth the nature of perception and thought (conscious and\nunconscious) and the nature of human motivation and striving (or, as\nhe would say, appetition). We will take up such topics in what\nfollows.\n",
