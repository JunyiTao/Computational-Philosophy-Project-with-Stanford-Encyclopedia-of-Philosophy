    "main_text": "The Star of Redemption || Part II\n3.3 Part II\n\n\nThe second part of the Star introduces theology as\ncomplement to philosophy: here the theological \u201ccategories\u201d\nof creation, revelation, and redemption are shown to\n\u201cfulfill\u201d what is promised in the philosophical\nconstructions of God, world, and self from the book\u2019s first part.\nThis fulfillment occurs through the \u201ccourse\u201d along which\nthe elemental God, world, and self step into relations with one\nanother, relations that form the actuality we experience. Rosenzweig\ndesignates the divine turning into relation with the world as\ncreation; the divine turning into relation with the individual\nself as revelation; and the turning of the self into loving\nrelation with the world as redemption. How we are to\nunderstand the beginning of this chain of relations\u2014i.e.,\nwhy the divine \u201ccreates\u201d the world\u2014is an\nopen question among scholars, and some claim that Rosenzweig intends\nthe original turning of the divine to the world, and to the self,\nrespectively, to be grasped as acts of will or love inexplicable by\nphilosophical means. But Rosenzweig also makes it clear that particular\nbeings need to step into relations with one another precisely\nin order to realize themselves as what they are. God does not\nactually become the God he is elementally until he realizes\ndivine freedom in the grounding of the existence of the world in\ncreation, and until he receives human recognition for his divine being\nthrough revelation. The world does not actually become the\nworld it is elementally until it receives its essential grounding from\nthe divine in creation, and until its particulars attain to their own\nvital self-determination in redemption. The self does not\nactually become what it is elementally until it is awoken to\nits free I-hood through revelation, and until it realizes its freedom\nin its turning in love to the world in redemption.\n\n\nNow, in order for each element to fulfill itself through its\nrelations to its others, Rosenzweig asserts, each must undergo a\ncertain transformation. Rosenzweig here draws methodological\nconsequences from the very notion of revelation itself. The German for\nrevelation, Offenbarung, suggests that every being must\nundergo a kind of \u201copening up\u201d in turning into the\nrelations with others that revelation entails. Such opening up\nand turning outward demands what Rosenzweig calls a\n\u201creversal\u201d [Umkehr] of the \u201cYes\u201d and\nthe \u201cNo\u201d which united within each isolated element. What\nwas the \u201cYes\u201d pole within a given elements (i.e., its\nsubstantial pole) reverses into a \u201cNo\u201d (i.e., activity),\nand what was the \u201cNo\u201d pole within the element reverses into\na \u201cYes\u201d. Relations between elements are constituted, then,\nwhen, e.g., the \u201cNo\u201d pole within a given element reverses\ninto a \u201cYes\u201d and then unites up with what had been the\n\u201cYes\u201d pole within another element, now reversed into a\n\u201cNo\u201d. To give an example: creation demands that\nthe active, free pole of God (\u201cNo\u201d) reverse itself into the\nsubstantial grounding (\u201cYes\u201d) of the existence of the world\n(\u201cNo\u201d) which itself emerged out of the reversal of the\nessential pole (\u201cYes\u201d) within the elemental world. The\nunion of divine \u201cYes\u201d and worldly \u201cNo\u201d forged\nin creation, then, attains the same \u201cfactual\u201d character as\nrelation as did the union of \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d\nwithin each element: creation is a fact\u2014a\n\u201cTatsache\u201d\u2014according to Rosenzweig, insofar as it\nresults from the unifying relation between the being of the divine\ncreator (\u201cSache\u201d) and the active existence\n(\u201cTat\u201d) of the world\n\n\nRosenzweig devotes great care to demonstrating that the elemental\nbeings fulfill themselves through their reversals into relations with\ntheir others. But over the course of the second part of the\nStar, Rosenzweig proceeds to show that while God, world, and\nself realize themselves as the beings that they are by entering into\nthese reciprocal relations, this very course of\nrelations\u2014creation, revelation, redemption\u2014will at once\nlead them to realize the unity of the \u201cAll\u201d. Indeed,\nthe Star locates the unity, posited by the German Idealists\nat the beginning of their systems, in the\nredemptive conclusion of its systematic course. And\nRosenzweig can claim to have articulated the \u201cAll\u201d in both\nits identity and difference within his system because the very course\nof relations that leads particulars to form the unity of the\n\u201cAll\u201d at once permits each particular to realize itself as\nparticular.\n\n\nThe course God, world, and self take into relations through the\nsecond part of the Star, according to Rosenzweig, generates\nthe actuality which we experience. Indeed, as indicated in the\n\u201cNew Thinking\u201d section above, Rosenzweig aims to show that\nwe have access to these relations of creation, revelation, and\nredemption, through the quintessentially temporal quality of our\nexperience. We experience the world we inhabit as\n\u201calready-there\u201d from the moment we become aware of it, and\nthis experience of the world as our past, Rosenzweig contends,\nis an experience of creation. Each of us experiences her own\nawakening to free selfhood as an experience that is quintessentially\npresent; it is none other than this experience of awakening to\nfree selfhood which Rosenzweig understands as our experience of\nrevelation. Finally, we experience our opening up into loving relations\nwith others in the world, and the possibilities such relations\ngenerate, through the prism of the future; and it is through\nthis future-directed experience that we anticipate\nredemption.\n\n\nRosenzweig draws important epistemological consequences from the\nfact that we can be shown to experience the relations of creation,\nrevelation, and redemption that occur between God, world, and self. He\nasserts that the fact that we have access through experience\nto the relations between those elements whose construction we traced\nthrough thought, offers us evidence for the credibility of\nthose very constructions. Rosenzweig suggests that the relationship\nbetween the thought of the first part of the Star and the\nexperience of the second part of the Star should be understood\nas one of promise and fulfillment; and he understands himself to be\nbringing together philosophy and theology in this very relation. For as\nthe elements constructed in the first part of the Star are\nshown to realize themselves, to fulfill their elemental potential\nthrough the theological relations of creation, revelation, and\nredemption, in the book\u2019s second part, Rosenzweig can claim to\nhave shown that philosophy finds its abstract constructs realized in\ntheology\u2019s account of actuality, and that theology finds the\nconditions for the possibility of its account of actuality in the\nconstructs of philosophy. It is this very reciprocally-confirming\nrelationship between philosophy and theology that Rosenzweig believes\nexemplifies the \u201cnew thinking.\u201d\n\n\nMuch as it was in his earlier thinking, the central theological\nconcept here in the second part of the Star is revelation. In\nRosenzweig\u2019s earliest formulations, revelation denotes the\nturning of the absolute other into relation with the human self in the\nworld, a relation through which the human self orients herself in the\nworld. In the Star, this same relation occurs in the midst of\na nexus of relations between beings, and it does indeed orient the\nhuman being who receives revelation within this nexus of relations.\nAware of herself as having been born into the world, awakening to her own\nfree selfhood, the human being is called on to enter into those\nrelations with others in the world that will realize the redemptive\nunity of the \u201cAll.\u201d Insofar as this unity of the\n\u201cAll\u201d is anticipated as future, moreover, its\nrealization may be said to depend on human beings taking up the\nvocation they become aware of in revelation. The systematic unity of\nthe \u201cAll\u201d Rosenzweig seeks to know in the present,\nremains a possibility to be actualized. And Rosenzweig understands\nrevelation to orient the human being towards this actualization.\n",
