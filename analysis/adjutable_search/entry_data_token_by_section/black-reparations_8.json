Supersession and Historic Injustices\n\n\nOthers have objected to arguments for reparations for\n\u201chistoric\u201d injustices, specifically Europeans\u2019 theft\nof Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the U.S. from their original\noccupiers the Aborigines, Maori, and American Indians (Waldron 1992:\n4\u201328). The basic objection is that the historic wrongs of the\nancestors of the Europeans now in the territories have been\n\u201csuperseded\u201d (Waldron 1992: 24). Possibly the objection can\nbe raised against the inheritance argument for reparations to U.S.\nblacks.\n\nThe following example has been used to illustrate what is meant by\nan historic wrong being superseded. Suppose that there are plenty of\nwater holes on the savanna and two groups P and Q\neach have a waterhole, but\n\n\n\nmotivated purely by greed, members of group Q descend on\nthe water hole possessed by group P and insist on sharing that\nwith them. (What\u2019s more they do not allow reciprocity; they do\nnot allow members of P to share any water hole that was\nlegitimately in the possession of Q.) That is an injustice.\nBut then circumstances change, and all the water holes of the territory\ndry up except the one that originally belonged to P. The\nmembers of group Q are already sharing that water hole on the\nbasis of their earlier incursion. But now that circumstances have\nchanged, they are entitled to share the water hole; so that their doing\nso no longer counts as an injustice. It is in fact part of what justice\nrequires. The initial injustice of Q against P has\nbeen superseded by circumstances. (Waldron 1992: 25)\n\n\n\nWhat is meant by the circumstances having changed so that the\ninitial injustice \u201chas been superseded?\u201d The meaning seems\nto be that, although the members of Q acted unjustly when they\nfirst shared P\u2019s water hole, they do not act unjustly\nnow when they share P\u2019s water hole; and this is because\ncircumstances have changed. In the changed circumstances the members of\nP and Q are now joint owners of the waterhole. It\nmight be asserted that this follows from one of the conditions Locke\nlaid down as necessary for taking something as property, the Lockean\nproviso, as Nozick famously put it (Nozick 1974: 175; Locke 1689: Book\nII, 5, sec 27). According to the proviso, the water hole used to be\nP\u2019s waterhole when circumstances were such that it was\npermissible for P to make it his property. But circumstances\nhave changed so that it is no longer permissible for P to make\nthe waterhole his exclusive property. The present circumstances make\nthe waterhole the joint property of P and Q.\n\nThis argument seems persuasive if we suppose that the only\nalternative to making the waterhole the joint property of P\nand Q is for P to prevent Q from using its\nwater since in that case Q would die very painfully. But there\nare other alternatives. Members of P (Ps) can\ngenerously allow the members of Q (Qs) to use the\nwater; or they can sell the water to the members of Q; or they\ncan rent Q a piece of land next to the waterhole. These\nalternatives may be ruled out by Locke\u2019s apparent opposition to\narrangements that put some people in a position of extraordinary\ndependence on others. For example, he argued that a beggar has a\n\u201cright\u201d to a portion of a rich man\u2019s surplus when she\nmust have it in order to survive. If so the Qs must have\nrights to an adequate supply of the water in P\u2019s\nwaterhole. Otherwise if the Ps with ostensible generosity\nallowed Qs to drink they could also have demanded demeaning\nbehavior from the Qs in exchange; or if they sold water to the\nQs they could raise its price as much as they liked; and so\non. But in any case, there are alternatives to the joint ownership of\nthe waterhole by the Ps and Qs that do not turn the\nQs into P\u2019s dependents. We could, for example,\ndivide the waterhole so that the Qs get an adequate supply of\nwater and are not dependent on the Ps.\n\nIn this scenario, the entire case for supersession would seem to\nrest on the Lockean proviso and its alleged prohibition of claiming\nunowned stuff as property when there is not enough and as good left\nover for others. We say \u201calleged prohibition\u201d for it is not\nat all clear that Locke\u2019s words amount to such a prohibition.\nHowever, the supersession thesis fails even if we allow the\nprohibition. To see this, let us agree that the Ps and\nQs are now joint owners of the waterhole and that the\nPs cannot demand that the Qs depart leaving them the\nwaterhole\u2019s sole owners. Our agreement does not imply that we\nalso agree that the Ps cannot demand reparations from the\nQs for the damages that the Qs earlier wrongly caused\nthem. That would be absurd because it implies that the Ps and\nthe Qs had always been joint owners of the waterhole, but by\nassumption the Ps and Qs were not always joint owners\nof the waterhole. In particular, by assumption, the Ps were\nonce the sole owners of the waterhole when the Qs attacked\nthem and stole their water. This foregoing sketch is meant to parallel\nthe case of the Europeans and indigenous peoples in New Zealand,\nAustralia, and the Americas. For convenience, let us consider the\nEuropeans and the Maoris in New Zealand. We concede that these two\npeople are now the joint owners of the land mass of New Zealand. The\nMaoris cannot demand that land mass back as reparation because they are\nno longer its sole owners. They used to be its sole owners, but\ncircumstances have changed and now they are only its joint owners. No\none can demand that anyone leave. But that concession does not make the\ninjustice of the European conquest two hundred years ago disappear into\nthin air. New Zealand may not now belong exclusively to the Maori, but\nit once did, and when it did, the Europeans did then injure them\nunjustly. If those injuries persist in the Maoris\u2019 descendants\nbecause the European conquerors and their descendants did not pay or\nmake reparations to the original Maoris, their descendants have rights\nto reparations against the Europeans\u2019 descendants for their\ninjuries, even if they do not have rights that the Europeans\u2019\ndescendants leave New Zealand to them. To put the point in a different\nway, the fact that restitution is no longer possible and morally\nmandatory does not imply that reparations is not still possible and\nmorally mandatory. Restitution, the return of a stolen item to its\nrightful owner, is often a part of making reparations to the victim of\nthe theft, but as we stressed earlier it is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for such reparations. It is not sufficient because if I\nsteal your bicycle and then return it to you, though I have made\nrestitution I have not made reparations since the damages you suffer as\na result of my theft may be more that the loss of the bicycle; and\nrestitution the return of your bicycle may not cancel, undo or erase\nthe damages you suffered as a result of my theft. And restitution is\nnot necessary for reparations because while the loss or destruction of\na stolen item may make its restitution impossible, it does not make\nreparation for the loss of the item impossible or obligatory. If the\nbicycle I stole from you is lost restitution is impossible. But it does\nnot follow that reparations is impossible. I can still make reparations\nto you by providing you with the money to buy another\n one.[4]\n\nThe distinction between restitution and reparations resolves another\ncase that may weaken sympathies for reparations for historic\ninjustices. The case involves the theft of a car that ends up years\nlater the treasured possession of the thief\u2019s daughter who has no\nidea that it was stolen (Waldron 1992, 14\u201315). In the meantime, the\ncar\u2019s original owner has eventually outgrown his attachment to it\nand gotten many other cars. The inference that we are invited to draw\nis that it would be wrong for him to compel the thief\u2019s daughter\nto return the car to him, given that she has invested so much of her\nlife in it and he has lost interest in it. Perhaps; but just because it\nwould be wrong of him to demand restitution, it does not follow that it\nwould be wrong of him to demand reparations; that his rights to\nreparations are somehow \u201csuperseded\u201d. This is an entirely\ndifferent question. The owner may act wrongly in insisting on\nrestitution; maybe he should allow the thief daughter to keep the car.\nBut it does not follow that he cannot demand reparations from the thief\nfor the losses he suffered as a result of the theft of his car.\n\nThese results should make it obvious that the supersession argument\ncannot nullify claims for reparations for historic injustices. To\nconsider the example of New Zealand, perhaps restitution of the land\nmass of New Zealand to the Maori is out of the question. Perhaps\njustice cannot demand that Europeans leave New Zealand to the Maori.\nBut it does not follow that justice does not demand that the Europeans\nmake reparations to the Maori for violating their rights and injuring\nthem when New Zealand belonged to them. Theft injures the victim by\ndepriving him of the thing that was stolen from him; but it also\ninjures him by depriving him of the benefits that he was going to earn\nand enjoy because of his possession of that thing. For the reasons we\nhave surveyed, he may lose his rights to restitution; the thing for\nexample may be lost or destroyed. But it does not follow that he\ntherefore also loses his rights to reparations. Arguments for those\nrights have to deal with the various objections to historic reparations\nreviewed in this entry and elsewhere, but they are not undone by the\nsupersession argument.\n",
