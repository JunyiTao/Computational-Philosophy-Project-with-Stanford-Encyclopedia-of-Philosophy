    "main_text": "History of and Significance of Principia Mathematica || History of Principia Mathematica\n2.1 History of Principia Mathematica\n\nLogicism is the view that (some or all of) mathematics can be reduced\nto (formal) logic. It is often explained as a two-part thesis. First,\nit consists of the claim that all mathematical truths can be\ntranslated into logical truths or, in other words, that the vocabulary\nof mathematics constitutes a proper subset of the vocabulary of logic.\nSecond, it consists of the claim that all mathematical proofs can be\nrecast as logical proofs or, in other words, that the theorems of\nmathematics constitute a proper subset of the theorems of logic. As\nRussell writes, it is the logicist\u2019s goal \u201cto show that\nall pure mathematics follows from purely logical premises and uses\nonly concepts definable in logical terms\u201d (1959: 74).\n\nThe logicist thesis appears to have been first advocated in the late\nseventeenth century by Gottfried Leibniz. Later, the idea was defended\nin much greater detail by Gottlob Frege. During the critical movement\nof the 1820s, mathematicians such as Bernard Bolzano, Niels Abel,\nLouis Cauchy, and Karl Weierstrass succeeded in eliminating much of\nthe vagueness and many of the contradictions present in the\nmathematics of their day. By the mid- to late-1800s, William Hamilton\nhad gone on to introduce ordered couples of reals as the first step in\nsupplying a logical basis for the complex numbers and Karl\nWeierstrass, Richard Dedekind, and Georg Cantor had all developed\nmethods for founding the irrationals in terms of the rationals. Using\nwork done by H.G. Grassmann and Richard Dedekind, Guiseppe Peano had\nthen gone on to develop a theory of the rationals based on his now\nfamous axioms for the natural numbers. By Frege\u2019s day, it was\nthus generally recognized that large parts of mathematics could be\nderived from a relatively small set of primitive notions.\n\nEven so, it was not until 1879, when Frege developed the necessary\nlogical apparatus, that logicism could finally be said to have become\ntechnically plausible. After another five years\u2019 work, Frege\narrived at the definitions necessary for logicising arithmetic and\nduring the 1890s he worked on many of the essential derivations.\nHowever, with the discovery of paradoxes such as\n Russell\u2019s paradox\n at the turn of the century, it appeared that additional resources\nwould need to be developed if logicism were to succeed.\n\nBy 1902, both Whitehead and Russell had reached this same conclusion.\nBoth men were in the initial stages of preparing second volumes to\ntheir earlier books on related topics: Whitehead\u2019s 1898 A\nTreatise on Universal Algebra and Russell\u2019s 1903 The\nPrinciples of Mathematics. Since their research overlapped\nconsiderably, they began collaborating on what would eventually become\nPrincipia Mathematica. By agreement, Russell worked primarily\non the philosophical parts of the project, including the book\u2019s\nphilosophically rich Introduction, the theory of\n descriptions,\n and the no-class theory (in which set or class terms become\nmeaningful only when placed in well-defined contexts), all of which\ncan still be read fruitfully even by non-specialists. The two men then\ncollaborated on the technical derivations. As Russell writes,\n\n\nAs for the mathematical problems, Whitehead invented most of the\nnotation, except in so far as it was taken over from Peano; I did most\nof the work concerned with series and Whitehead did most of the rest.\nBut this only applies to first drafts. Every part was done three times\nover. When one of us had produced a first draft, he would send it to\nthe other, who would usually modify it considerably. After which, the\none who had made the first draft would put it into final form. There\nis hardly a line in all the three volumes which is not a joint\nproduct. (1959: 74)\n\n\nInitially, it was thought that the project might take a year to\ncomplete. Unfortunately, after almost a decade of difficult work on\nthe part of the two men, Cambridge University Press concluded that\npublishing Principia would result in an estimated loss of 600\npounds. Although the press agreed to assume half this amount and the\nRoyal Society agreed to donate another 200 pounds, this still left a\n100-pound deficit. Only by each contributing 50 pounds were the\nauthors able to see their work through to publication. (Whitehead,\nRussell, & James 1910)\n\nPublication involved the enormous job of type-setting all three\nvolumes by hand. In 1911, the printing of the second volume was\ninterrupted when Whitehead discovered a difficulty with the symbolism.\nThe result was the insertion (on roman numeral pages) of a long\n\u201cPrefatory Statement of Symbolic Conventions\u201d at the\nbeginning of Volume II.\n\nThe initial print run of 750 copies of Volume I and 500 copies of each\nof Volumes II and II from Cambridge University Press had been sold by\n1922 when Rudolf Carnap wrote to Russell asking for a copy. Russell\nresponded by sending Carnap a 35 page handwritten summary of the\ndefinitions and some important theorems in the work (Linsky 2011:\n14\u201315). As no plates were available for a second printing,\nRussell began the work of preparing a second edition that appeared in\n1925\u201327. The first was reset along with a new introduction and\nthree appendices, and Volume II was reset as well. Volume III was\nreproduced by a photographic process, and so the page numbers from the\nfirst edition are the same in this volume. Principia\nMathematica is still in print with Cambridge University Press.\nAs\nwith many works in mathematics, the later progress of the field of\nsymbolic logic led to numerous improvements. Work in the\nschool of logic started by David Hilbert at G\u00f6ttingen and in the\nPolish school of logicians led by S. Le\u015bniewski and his most famous student, Alfred Tarski, began with correcting\nwhat they saw as defects and gaps in PM. See Kahle (2013) and Wolenski (2013). The criticisms were immediate,\nbegun by Chwistek (1912) soon after the first volume had been\npublished. A series of important new presentations of mathematical\nlogic, in particular Hilbert and Ackermann (1928), Hilbert and Bernays\n(1934), and Kleene (1952), were adopted as text books by successive\ngenerations of logicians. As pointed out in Urquhart (2013) this lead\nto a slow decline in the number of references to PM in technical work\nin logic, as well as its gradual replacement by other texts for the\nIntroduction to Symbolic Logic courses that soon became a staple\noffering of university departments of philosophy. By the 1950s PM was\nno longer used as a textbook, even in graduate courses. PM\u2019s\ninfluence, then, was enormous from 1910 to 1950, with it now having\nthe status of a recognized classic that is unfamiliar to students of\nlogic, and even unreadable because of its superseded notation. This\nentry, together with the entry on \n the notation in Principia Mathematica,\n are intended to make the contributions of this monumental work\navailable, and to enable further research on some of the ideas hidden\nin those three long volumes.\n",
