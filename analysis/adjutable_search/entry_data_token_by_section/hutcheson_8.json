    "main_text": "Hutcheson\u2019s Normative Ethics || Virtue and Utility\n2.3 Virtue, Happiness, and Hedonism\n\nThe first sentence of Hutcheson\u2019s System of Moral\nPhilosophy runs this way: \n\n\nThe intention of moral philosophy is to direct men to that course of\naction which tends most effectually to promote their greatest\nhappiness and perfection; as far as it can be done by observations and\nconclusions discoverable from the constitution of nature, without aids\nof supernatural revelation. (System, 1) \n\n\nPut another way, Hutcheson holds that his aim in discussing the very\nnature of virtue, benevolence, and the moral sense, is to persuade\npeople to act in such a way as to develop \u201ctheir greatest\nhappiness and perfection\u201d (see Heydt 2009). And to this end, it\nis important to note that Hutcheson steadfastly maintains that\nvirtuous behavior is in the interest of the virtuous. Of course, given\nthat Hutcheson holds that behavior is virtuous insofar as it is\nmotivated by benevolence and not self-interest, it is\nimpossible (on Hutcheson\u2019s view) to pursue one\u2019s\nself-interest through virtuous behavior. To be motivated by self-love\ndiminishes, to that extent, the virtue of one\u2019s action.\n\nBut it is nevertheless the case, for Hutcheson, that virtue\nis in one\u2019s self-interest. Notice, however, that\nHutcheson\u2019s argument for this claim is not straightforward. As\nhas already been indicated, Hutcheson is a hedonist: \n\n\nBecause we shall afterwards frequently use the Words Interest,\nAdvantage, natural Good, it is necessary here to fix their Ideas. The\nPleasure in our sensible Perceptions of any kind, gives us our first\nIdea of natural Good, or Happiness; and then all Objects which are apt\nto excite this Pleasure are call\u2019d immediately Good\u2026Our\nSense of Pleasure is antecedent to Advantage or Interest, and is the\nFoundation of it. (Inquiry, 86) \n\n\nBut how could it be that a hedonist, of all things, believes\nthat benevolent acts\u2014acts that are motivated for the good of\nothers\u2014are always in our self-interest? Surely such acts can\ninvolve sacrifice of our own pleasure, as when a father dutifully endures the\npainful duration of \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: the Live\nMusical!\u201d for the sake of his daughter\u2019s delight in\nwatching it.\n\nThe simple story, to be complicated shortly, runs this way. Hutcheson\nholds that the moral sense is a greater repository of pleasure than\nthe other senses. He says, in many places, that the operation of the\nmoral sense provides more pleasure than the operation of the\nother senses, internal and external. Hutcheson states, in the\nInquiry, that the moral sense \u201cgives us more Pleasure\nand Pain that all our other Facultys\u201d (Inquiry, 163).\nIn the Essay, Hutcheson writes: \n\n\nOur moral Sense thus regulated, and constantly followed in our\nActions, may be the most constant Source of the most stable\nPleasure. (Essay, 126)\n\n\nHutcheson offers a number of arguments for this, generally appealing\nto our own intuitions about the nature of happiness: \n\n\nNow should we imagine a rational Creature in a sufficiently happy\nState, though his Mind was, without interruption, wholly\noccupy\u2019d with pleasant Sensations of Smell, Taste, Touch,\n&c., if at the same time all other Ideas were excluded? Should we\nnot thing the State low, mean and sordid, if there were no Society, no\nLove or Friendship, no good Offices? (Inquiry, 163) \n\n\nSo much for the external senses. But he goes on: \n\n\nWould we ever wish to be in the same Condition with a wrathful,\nmalicious, revengeful, or envious Being, tho we were at the same time\nto enjoy all the Pleasures of the external and internal\nsenses?\u2026What Castle-builder, who forms to himself imaginary\nScenes of Life, in which he thinks he should be happy, ever made\nacknowledg\u2019d Treachery, Cruelty, or Ingratitude, the Steps by\nwhich he mounted to his wish\u2019d for Elevation, or Parts of his\nCharacter, when he had attain\u2019d it? We always conduct our selves\nin such Reveries, according to the Dictates of Honour, Faith,\nGenerosity, Courage\u2026. (Inquiry, 163\u20134)\n\n\nNow, this is fine as far as it goes. But notice that Hutcheson does\nnot explain why it should be that, e.g., our Castle-building friends\ntend to imagine that they are virtuous rather than vicious. And why\nshould it be that in every case, the virtuous are better-off than the\nvicious?\n\nA key mechanism here is the notion of a \u201creflex Act\u201d. Lord\nShaftesbury\u2014borrowing Locke\u2019s notion of\n\u201creflection\u201d\u2014introduces the idea this way (see Baier\n& Luntley 1995):\n\n\nIn a Creature capable of forming general Notions of Things, not only\nthe outward Beings which offer themselves to the Sense, are the\nObjects of the Affection; but the very Actions themselves,\nand the Affections of Pity, Kindness, Gratitude, and their\nContrarys, being brought into the Mind by Reflection, become Objects.\nSo that, by means of this reflected Sense, there arises another kind\nof Affection towards those very Affections themselves, which have been\nalready felt, and are now become the subject of new Liking or Dislike.\n(Shaftesbury 1711, v. 2, 16)\n\n\nFor Hutcheson, while we do not immediately receive pleasure from our\nown virtuous actions, we nevertheless can take the part of a spectator\nto ourselves. When we do this, our virtuous actions will trigger our\nmoral sense, itself\u2014as Hutcheson is insistent upon\u2014the\nfount of the most valuable pleasures. (Hutcheson details this in the\n\u201cD\u201d (i.e., final, 1738) edition of the Inquiry.)\nHe writes: \n\n\nevery Spectator is persuaded that the reflex Acts of the virtuous\nAgent upon his own Temper will give him the highest pleasures.\n(Inquiry, 217n47)\n\n\nAgain, this is fine as far as it goes. But we may still wonder why it\nis that such \u201creflex Acts\u201d, even if engaging the moral\nsense, necessarily produce the \u201chighest pleasures?\u201d And\nwhat is exactly meant by such a phrase?\n\nOne solution to this puzzle, opted for by some commentators, holds\nthat Hutcheson is a kind of qualitative hedonist\u2014a view\naccording to which some pleasures are of higher quality, and therefore\nmore valuable, pleasurableness held equal (Edwards 1979: 30; Riley\n2008: 275; Strasser 1987: 518; Crisp 2020: 124). And there are some\nvery tantalizing passages that suggest just this:\n\n\nAs to pleasures of the same kind, \u2019tis manifest their values are\nin a joint proportion of their intenseness and duration. In estimating\nthe duration, we not only regard the constancy of the object, or its\nremaining in our power, and the duration of the sensations it affords,\nbut the constancy of our fancy or relish: for when this changes it\nputs an end to the enjoyment. In comparing pleasures of different\nkinds, the value is as the duration and dignity of the kind jointly.\nWe have an immediate sense of a dignity, a perfection, or beatifick\nquality in some kinds, which no intenseness of the lower kinds can\nequal, were they also as lasting as we could wish. No intenseness or\nduration of any external sensation gives it a dignity or worth equal\nto that of the improvement of the soul by knowledge, or the ingenious\narts; and much less is it equal to that of virtuous affections and\nactions. (System, 117)\n\n\nHere it would seem that Hutcheson\u2019s justification for treating\nvirtuous conduct as in the interest of the virtuous is as plain as\nday. In conducting our \u201creflex Acts\u201d concerning our own\nvirtuous conduct, we trigger our \u201cvirtuous affections\u201d,\nwhich themselves have a \u201cworth\u201d that no intenseness or\nduration of any external sensation could match. If we interpret\nHutcheson as a qualitative hedonist, the explanation of the benefits\none maintains as a result of virtue are straightforward.\n\nWhat is less straightforward is whether or not Hutcheson genuinely is\nthis form of qualitative hedonist. And there is very good reason to\ndoubt it. (Much more detailed argument for this point is available in\nDorsey 2010.) Nowhere in this passage is the \u201cdignity\u201d of\na pleasure thought an axiologically significant variable. In the\nEssay, Hutcheson writes explicitly that: \n\n\nThe Value of any Pleasure, and the Quantity or\nMoment of any Pain, is in a compounded proportion of the\nIntenseness and Duration. (Essay, 87) \n\n\nIn the Inquiry, he seems especially clear that the\nsuperiority of the moral sense is quantitative rather than\nqualitative: it produces \u201cmore\u201d pleasure than our other\nsenses (Inquiry, 162). Furthermore, while the System\npassage cited above is extremely suggestive when it comes to\ninterpreting Hutcheson as a qualitative hedonist, a mere chapter\nearlier in the System he seems to commit to a straightforward\nquantitative hedonism: \n\n\nsupreme happiness must consist in the most constant enjoyment of the\nmost intense and durable pleasures. (System, 100) \n\n\nOn a quantitative reading of Hutcheson\u2019s hedonism, rather than\nbeing an axiological guarantee that the pleasures of the moral sense\nare more valuable, it is simply a matter of psychological fact that\nhuman beings take more intense and durable pleasures from the moral\nsense, sufficient to override whatever joys may be taken in the low\nroad.\n",
