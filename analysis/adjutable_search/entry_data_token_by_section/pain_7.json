    "main_text": "Perceptual theories || Introduction\n3.1 Introduction\n\nThe core commitment of any perceptual view of pain, put as broadly as\npossible, is that normally, in having or feeling pain, one is\nperceiving something extramental. In other words, feeling\npain normally involves perceiving something in the same sense\nin which one perceives a red apple when one sees it in good light. It\ninvolves exteroception. Sometimes, in ordinary parlance, the term\n\u2018perception\u2019 is used in conjunction with\n\u2018pain\u2019 as in \u2018pain perception\u2019 to mean\nawareness of pain, or just feeling/experiencing pain. This is the\nintrospective use of \u2018perception\u2019 and should be\nsharply distinguished from what the perceptual theorists mean when\nthey claim that feeling pain involves perceiving something. They have\nexteroception in mind, and we\u2019ll use the term always in this\nsense.\n\nAccording to perceptual theorists, when one feels, say, a sharp pain\nin the back of one\u2019s hand, one perceives some physical feature\nor condition of one\u2019s hand. The proper modality for this\nperception is somatosensory, similar to the sensory modality of touch\nor proprioception (the sensory modality internal to one\u2019s body\nthat informs one about the position and movement of one\u2019s body\nand body parts). Most perceptual theorists identify this feature with\ntissue damage or some condition of the tissue that would likely result\nin damage if sustained in that condition. More abstractly, it is some\nsort of physical disorder due to some tissue trauma, irritation,\ninflammation, or some such pathological condition, or a condition\nclose to such. It is also possible to identify the object of\nperception in pain with the activation of nociceptors innervating the\ndamaged or irritated tissue. (Nociceptors are peripheral nerve endings\nrelatively specialized to respond to potentially damaging stimuli,\ni.e., to noxious stimuli). Let\u2019s use \u2018tissue damage\u2019\nas a stand-in for whatever physical disorderly condition of bodily\ntissue is said to be perceived in feeling pain according to perceptual\ntheorists. Normally, when we talk about the location of a pain, we are\ntalking about the location of this perceptual object, i.e., the\nlocation where the tissue damage is occurring or about to occur.\n\nPerceptual theories of pain as alternatives to sense-datum theories\nwere first explicitly stated and philosophically developed in the\n1960s. The most influential and prominent defenders were Armstrong\n(1962; 1968) and Pitcher (1970; 1971). There were others, but in terms\nof setting the tone and philosophical agenda for the subsequent\ndiscussion for decades to come, it is fair to say that no one has\nsurpassed their enormous\n influence.[9]\n At the time, the dominant view was that pains and other intransitive\nbodily sensations are not perceptual at all: they were conceived to be\nsensations or experiences (\u00e0 la sense-datum theories) that are\nreliably caused by (actual or impending) injury or damage to body\ntissue or internal organs. They were thus thought to be useful warning\nsignals, but they didn\u2019t have much in common with standard ways\nof perceiving extramental world. This view has still many defenders\ntoday. Although the conception of pains as sense-data has been largely\nabandoned, those who are not sympathetic to perceptual theories still\nhold what might be called the \u201csensation or qualia view of\npain\u201d, according to which pain is not a phenomenal\nobject but a phenomenal quality of one\u2019s\nexperience, or alternatively, it is a subjective experience with\ncertain qualia or qualitative character that one is directly\nacquainted with when one is in pain. (Conee 1984 defends a qualia view\nof pain. But he draws a distinction between the state of being in pain\nand this state\u2019s qualitative content, qualia. He claims that we\nuse \u2018pain\u2019 for both, depending on the context. Aydede 2019\ndevelops a modern version of qualia theories that is adverbialist and\nweak representationalist with completely physicalist credentials and\nclaimed to be free of the problems that plagued the older qualia\ntheories.)\n",
