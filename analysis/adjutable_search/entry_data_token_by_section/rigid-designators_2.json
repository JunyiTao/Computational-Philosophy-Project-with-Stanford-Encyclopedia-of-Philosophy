    "main_text": "A Basic Characterization of Rigid Designation, its Interest, and the Breadth of its Application || Rigidity for a Diversity of Grammatical Categories\n1.3 Rigidity for a Diversity of Grammatical Categories\n\nRigidity is most straightforwardly applied to proper names of concrete\nobjects. There is general agreement that \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Biden\u2019 refer rigidly. The debate about which\nexpressions in natural languages are rigid designators is typically\nset up with a background assumption that proper names are singular\nterms. This assumption is challenged by predicative accounts of names (think of \u2018every Biden\u2019:  Fara 2015).  Whether such alternatives can \u201cexplain why names are rigid\u201d (Lee 2020, p. 253; Schoubye 2018), perhaps in recognizing singular reference or denotation for some uses of names tacitly equivalent to demonstratives or definite descriptions (categories discussed below), remains a matter of controversy.\n\n\nRigidity is applied commonly to indexicals, like\n\u2018now\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019, as well as names. If, when I use\n\u2018you\u2019 in a context, my utterance means something like\nthe person at the door (Nunberg 1993; Smith 1989 \u00a75),\nthen presumably it is not rigid. You may be at the door, but in\nanother possible world it is another philosopher who comes visiting.\nOn the other hand, if (as Kaplan proposes: 1989a) \u2018you\u2019\nrefers directly to an individual, without amounting to a disguised\ndescription meaning the same as a description like \u2018the person\nat the door\u2019, then it would seem to be rigid. So if I say,\npleasantly surprised, \u201cYou made good time,\u201d we could\ndiscuss reasons for this and conditions under which this might not\nhave been the case, but in all of our considerations the same\nindividual, and not anyone else who might have been at my door in good\ntime or not, is the one in question. The individual in question is the\none who is in fact identical to you (as any account\ncould put it). After Kaplan, indexicals have typically been treated as\nrigid; but there seem to be nonrigid uses. \n\nDemonstratives such as \u2018that\u2019 raise similar issues as\nindexicals. So also do noun phrases like \u2018that flower you just\npicked\u2019 (see King 2001, chap 2, for discussion). As Wolter\n(2009, p. 457) observes, \u201cthere is not yet consensus\u201d\nabout which such expressions \u201callow non-rigid interpretations\nand which do not,\u201d but it is standard to hold some to be rigid (Nowak 2019).\n\nThe paradigm example of non-rigid designators, since the work\nof of Kripke, has been definite descriptions like\n\u2018the brightest non-lunar object in the evening sky\u2019.\nHowever, some definite descriptions, such as \u2018the successor of\n2\u2019, are rigid designators; their rigidity seems to arise in\nvirtue of facts about metaphysical reality, in this case, the\nnecessity of mathematical facts, rather than facts about the semantic\nproperties of expressions. Such definite descriptions are therefore\n\u201cde facto\u201d rigid designators. The Russellian view that\ndefinite descriptions are quantified expressions is also widely held.\nSince it is natural to think of rigidity but not, in view of Russell,\nto think of definite descriptions in connection with singularity, the\nquestion dawns of how to think about rigidity with categories of\nexpressions other than singular terms. This broad topic, which\nsurfaces in other connections too, has received much discussion in\nrecent years. \n\nAnother category of terms whose singular status raises questions is\nthat of natural kind terms like \u2018gold\u2019 and\n\u2018water\u2019. Again, these seem widely to be thought singular\nat least some of the time. They are frequently counted as rigid. Other\nrelated and again apparently singular terms that are sometimes counted\nrigid include \u2018redness\u2019 and \u2018loudness\u2019. More\ncontroversial are singular terms for properties that are more\nartificial: \u2018bachelorhood\u2019, or \u2018soda pop\u2019.  \nNot just singular terms but also general terms, like\n\u2018tiger\u2019, \u2018hot\u2019, and \u2018red\u2019 are\noften recognized as rigid (following Kripke\u2019s suggestion: 1980, p.\n134). These terms raise complications not present for singular\nterms.  I discuss kind and property terms toward the end of this entry.\n\nTerms from other grammatical categories, as well, might admit a\nrigid/non-rigid distinction (for the broadest account of rigidity available, see Haze 2021). Philosophers have attended relatively\nlittle to the status of verbs and adverbs, in this connection (but\nsee, e.g., L\u00f3pez de Sa 2008). Compare \u2018to begin\nwriting\u2019, \u2018to commence writing\u2019, and \u2018to do\nwhat the teacher commanded at time t\u2019 (where the\ncommand was, \u201cBegin writing\u201d). Evidently, the necessity of\n\u2018One is about to begin writing if and only if one is about to\ncommence writing\u2019 is not enjoyed by \u2018One is about to begin\nwriting if and only if one is about to do what the teacher commanded\nat time t\u2019. Arguably, the reason for the modal\ndifferences has to do with the rigidity or non-rigidity, in some\nappropriately extended sense, of the contained verbs. Something\nsimilar applies to adverbs. Compare \u2018She ran quickly\u2019 with\n\u2018She ran in the manner signaled by her coach\u2019 (where the\nsignal means: Run quickly!). \n",
