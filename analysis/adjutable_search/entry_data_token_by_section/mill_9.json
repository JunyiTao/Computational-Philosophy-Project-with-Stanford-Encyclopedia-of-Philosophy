    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Theoretical Philosophy || Mill\u2019s Theoretical Philosophy: Self-Supporting or Self-Undermining?\n3.7 Mill\u2019s Theoretical Philosophy: Self-Supporting or Self-Undermining?\n\nMill\u2019s theoretical philosophy is, in an important sense,\ncircular and self-supporting (Skorupski 1989: 125, 149). As noted,\nMill views enumerative induction\u2014the sole method of warranted\ntheoretical reasoning\u2014as self-validating and self-improving. We\nspontaneously take certain initial inductive moves to be justified.\nInduction\u2019s self-examination then leads to an increasing\nconfidence that induction is a warranted way of reasoning\nabout the world, and to a general sharpening of that method of\nreasoning. Induction could have been self-undermining\u2014its\nsuccess as a form of reasoning about the world, established on its own\nterms, is not trivial.\n\nMore broadly, however, Mill\u2019s theoretical view of mind and world\nis as a whole circular and self-supporting. Mill\u2019s\nnaturalistic picture of the relation between mind and world\u2014of\nthe mind as itself part of the natural order and incapable of\nknowledge a priori\u2014must itself be treated as a\nsubstantive discovery. As such, it could only be arrived at by\ninductive reasoning. Inductive investigation allows us to better\nunderstand that the mind is itself governed by natural laws\u2014and\nto better understand the processes of sense perception that allow us\nto be causally receptive to the world. Elements of Mill\u2019s\nassociationist psychology are apt to strike us as outdated\u2014but\nthat does not alter the basic point that the naturalistic study of\nmind has been enormously successful in affording a better\nunderstanding of how we process the world we occupy. Such discoveries\nclarify and strengthen our sense of why a priori knowledge is\nimpossible in the first place, and why empirical investigation is\nnecessary for any genuine knowledge.\n\nThe view that Mill sketches is rich in potential\u2014and it has\nsufficient breadth to promise a successful means of theoretically\norienting ourselves in the world. The issue, of course, is, whether\nnaturalism is the only possible view. Granting that\nMill\u2019s theoretical philosophy is impressive on the grounds of\noffering a systematic and coherent way of thinking about the world and\nthe history of our theoretical engagement with it, the question\nremains whether that coherence and systematicity is any guarantee of\ntruth. The question must remain whether there are equally\ngood non-naturalistic ways of thinking about the world and our place\nwithin it. Because naturalism is a substantive doctrine, that is a\npossibility to which Mill must remain open.\n\nA more pressing question still is whether Mill\u2019s picture truly\nis coherent. As discussed above, Mill\u2019s naturalistic\napproach drives him, via his inductivism and endorsement of\nthe Relativity of Knowledge, towards idealism. Ultimately, he holds,\nthe only things that we can be warranted in believing are permanent\npossibilities of sensation. But such objects are not\u2014at least\nnot obviously\u2014natural entities. Mill is never entirely\nclear about the status of the permanent possibilities of sensation. To\nthe extent that they are ideal objects, we might doubt their status as\nnatural entities; the further reified such entities are in relation to\nactual sensations, the less plausible it is to characterise\nthe inference from sensation to the possibility of sensation as an\ninductive one. Whether Mill\u2019s naturalism is compatible with his\nidealism is very much an open question.\n\nThe worry enters from multiple directions. Perhaps most obviously, it\ncalls into question the down-to-earth realism that Mill endorses\nwithin the philosophy of science. Mill\u2019s claim that that the\nprocess of science involves finding the structure already\npresent in nature seems at least in tension with the claim that\nall knowledge is phenomenal and relativized. More subtly, Mill\u2019s\nbasic conception of the relation of mind and world also seems\nchallenged. Mill claims that a priori knowledge is impossible\nbecause we cannot know \n\n\nthat the universe of thought and that of reality, the Microcosm and\nthe Macrocosm (as they were once called) must have been framed in in\ncomplete correspondence with one another. (Examination, IX:\n68) \n\n\nBut if the world is fundamentally ideal\u2014if, as Mill\nseems to claim, our world is the world as conditioned by our\nmediating senses, because we can know and represent it in no other\nway\u2014we might wonder why a basic harmony between the\narchitecture of mind and world should not be taken as given, and a\npriori knowledge not be possible. Indeed, Mill\u2019s claim that\ncognition must be mediated by some method of\ncognising\u2014that any creature must perceive in this\nway\u2014itself seems suspiciously unrevisable and a\npriori.\n\nThese problems emerge because the priority between mind and world in\nMill\u2019s work is unclear: the mind is seen as both the condition\nfor the representation of the only world we ever encounter, and as a\nnatural object within the world. The former is brought to the\nforeground only in Mill\u2019s most philosophical moments\u2014the\nlatter is present throughout Mill\u2019s characterisation of\nscientific and ordinary thinking. One option to resolve this tension,\nof course, is to follow Kant in distinguishing transcendental and\nempirical levels of reflection\u2014another is to follow the\npost-Kantian idealists in attempting to unite and overcome such\noppositions wherever they occur. Mill, however, never worked through\nthe internal pressures of his own position with sufficient rigour to\nfeel the push within naturalism towards these\n positions.[4]\n",
