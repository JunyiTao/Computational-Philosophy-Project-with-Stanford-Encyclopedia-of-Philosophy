    "main_text": "The Public Justification Principle || Idealization\n2.4 Idealization\n\nOnce the outer bounds of the public are set (see\n Section 2.5\n below), and we know which individuals have to have reason(s) for some\narrangement to legitimize that arrangement, public reason liberals\nmust explain how to ascribe reasons to the members of this group.\nSpecifically, public reason liberals, unless they are empirical\nconsent theorists, engage in idealization to show how citizens\u2019\nbeliefs, desires, and values enter into the process of public\njustification. Idealization is the practice of considering\ncitizens\u2019 beliefs, desires, and values as if they possessed good\ninformation and good reasoning. It is typically employed because an\nindividual\u2019s morally significant reasons may not be the same as\nthe reasons she affirms. Her affirmed reasons might rest on poor\ninformation, poor reasoning, or incoherent beliefs and desires.\nJustificatory populism determines citizens\u2019 reasons by\ntheir actual commitments (Eberle 2002, 200).\n\nRawls\u2019s primary model of idealization (1971, 118) is the veil of\nignorance. It models parties as reasonable by withholding information\nthat would undermine the impartiality of their deliberations. (The\nveil device models reasonableness and the parties\u2019 veiled\nreasoning models rationality.) J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1999, 198)\nprefers deliberative conditions without abstract idealization. He\nconstrains the form of discourse to actual individuals. David Gauthier\n(1986, 245) prefers a bargaining scenario. Individuals know the\ncharacteristics of persons, but they do not know which person they\nare.\n\nIdealization alters citizens\u2019 belief-value sets. A\ncitizen\u2019s belief-value set is the set of all her beliefs,\ndesires, goals, and plans, i.e., everything she thinks and wants.\n(This idea derives from Bernard Williams\u2019s (1981, 102)\nconception of a subjective motivational set.) A citizen is idealized\nwhen we consider her belief-value set as it might be. Theorists change\none or more of her beliefs, desires, and goals according to some\ncriteria. They may imagine her having more or different information or\nvalues. Or they must insist on modeling her as fully rational. Both\nmodels alter her belief-value set. And the appropriate level of\nidealization might vary with context. Perhaps it depends on the\nepistemic quality of reasoning demanded by the situation. (Some\nreasoning aims to design institutions, whereas one might use other\nreasoning to plan a family vacation).\n\nTo motivate idealization, consider how public justification fares\nwithout it. Populist views \u201ctake citizens as they are: the\ndefault populist position is that a rationale \\(R\\) counts as a public\njustification only if the members of the public find \\(R\\) acceptable\nin light of their existing [subjective motivational sets],\nirrespective of their epistemic pockmarks and doxastic defects\u201d\n(Eberle 2002, 200). Populist conceptions of idealization have severe\nproblems.  People can \u201cwithhold their assent because of\nobstinacy, selfishness, laziness, perversity, or confusion\u201d\n(Gaus 1996, 121). Populism also problematically requires asking\neveryone about their reasons before deciding whether a coercive law is\njustified.\n2.4.1 Radical Idealization\n\nPublic justification theorists typically prefer radical idealization.\nThey do this to fix the weaknesses of justificatory populism and alter\nbelief-value sets to rid them of inconsistencies and ignorance.\nRadical idealization thus has two dimensions\u2014rationality and\ninformation\u2014pushed to their upper bound.\n2.4.1.1 Rationality\n\nThe distinction between full rationality and less-than-full\nrationality is central to idealization. Though, as we will see, full\nrationality is elusive. To attribute reasons to citizens based on poor\nreasoning corrupts public justification. A theory of full rationality\nidealizes agents by giving parties flawless cognitive powers. (See\nRawls (1971, 12) and Gauthier (1986, 234) for explicit attributions of\nfull rationality to their agents.)\n\nThe assumption of full rationality initially seems irresistible. If we\ncan discern the reasons citizens would affirm if perfectly rational,\nsurely these reasons would be morally relevant. The public reason\nliberal tries to justify demands and coercion to members of her\nsociety. How could she do better than full rationality? Another\nmotivation for embracing full rationality is to generate agreement.\nMany assume that suitably idealized individuals will agree on matters\nthey otherwise would not. Rawls ascribes full rationality to parties\nto the original position to induce agreement. Were they less than\nfully rational, the parties might reach different conclusions.\n\nBut problems with full rationality abound. First, the notion of full\nrationality may be incoherent when applied to finite and fallible\nbeings (see Cherniak 1986). It requires adjusting a dense web of\nbeliefs and values. And these beliefs and values are not computable in\nreal-time given limited resources. Second, full rationality will\nproduce justifications that individuals cannot reflectively endorse.\nIndividuals\u2019 actual beliefs and values differ significantly from\nthose which justify the arrangements. (This is one way in which the\nproblem of stability might arise. See below 5.2.)\n2.4.1.2 Information\n\nAgain, public reason liberals add information to the belief-value set\nof ordinary citizens. (And, indeed, remove misinformation.) They\nthereby avoid holding public justification captive to ignorance.\nRawls, Gauthier, and Habermas all pursue this strategy. Their models\nassume that idealized agents have all (and only) the facts that\ndetermine what reasons they have. Public reason liberals remove\nbeliefs and desires that stop individuals from adopting an impartial\nperspective. They add such general and specific information necessary\nfor the agent to reason well about the issues before her. Public\nreason liberals disagree about what sets of information interfere with\nimpartiality. But all theorists subtract misinformation and biasing\ninformation.\n\nInformational idealization ranges between complete information and\nadequate or relevant information. The motivations for embracing and\nrejecting full information resemble those for full rationality. A full\ninformation account is attractive because it attributes reasons to\ncitizens based on many true propositions and no false ones. Further,\ncomplete information might guarantee determinate recommendations, and\nif agents share relevant information, they will tend to converge on\nsimilar conclusions. Yet, complete information may model citizens in\nan implausibly abstract fashion, and it gives them powers that no\nfinite and fallible being has.\n2.4.2 Moderate Idealization\n\nPublic reason liberals take criticisms of radical idealization\nincreasingly seriously. (See Gaus 2011, 232\u2013260 and Vallier\n2014, 145\u2013180.) If these criticisms are successful, one might\nreconsider returning to justificatory populism. However, there may be\na third option: moderate idealization. Moderate idealization assigns\nreasons based on some standard of adequate information and reasoning.\nYet it falls short of full information and perfect reasoning. The\nmoderate idealization theorist argues that we can go too far in\nseparating idealized belief-value sets from citizens\u2019 dingy,\nreal-world belief-value sets. We will eventually sever the tie between\nthem. And, as Wolterstorff insists (2007, 153), the idealized person\nmay have no reason to care about his counterpart\u2019s\nrecommendations. (Also see Enoch 2013, 164\u2013170; for a reply, see\nGaus 2015). The pull toward radical idealization must balance\nrespecting citizens as they are. (This latter element will be crucial\nfor maintaining stability; see 5.2.) Radical idealization may test the\n\u201cstrains of commitment\u201d (Rawls 1971, 155\u20139) in\ndemanding that citizens cognitively struggle to see what reasons they\nhave. But moderate idealization may prove acceptable to most ordinary\ncitizens. Moderate idealization is an appropriate acknowledgment of\nthe demands of the impartial perspective.\n2.4.3 Reasonableness\n\nIdealization limits the set of reasons that figure into public\njustification. \u201cNormative\u201d idealizations that represent\nthe public as reasonable do likewise. In one way, reasonableness may\nseem to be a redundant category. Rawls, Gauthier, and Habermas\nrepresent citizens as reasonable by depriving them of partializing\ninformation. But reasonableness is not redundant. It attributes\ncognitive dispositions to agents uncaptured by idealizing beliefs,\ndesires, and values.\n\nRawls\u2019s conception of the reasonable plays two roles in his\ntheory of justice. First, the veil of ignorance models reasonableness.\nBut a citizen of the well-ordered society is also reasonable because\nshe possesses the following four dispositions (Rawls 2005,\n49\u201352, 53\u201358, 60, 76, 119, 162\u20133, 229). (1) A\ndisposition to engage in public justification or to offer\njustifications for her own preferred principles and abide by the\njustified principles proposed by others. (2) A disposition to\nrecognize the \u201cburdens of judgment\u201d implies reasonable\npluralism. (3) A disposition to reject the repression of other\nreasonable points of view. (4) A disposition to rely on methods of\nreasoning that others can share or access.\n\nPublic reason liberals share something like the standard conception of\nreasonableness. But idealizing members of the public as reasonable\nruns into two problems. First, such idealization risks ruling too many\ncitizens out of the justificatory public. Second, representing the\npublic as reasonable might forestall justifying coercive social\narrangements in a way that helps them to approximate a voluntary\nagreement (Nagel 1987).\n",
