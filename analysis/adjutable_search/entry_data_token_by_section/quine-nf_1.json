    "main_text": "Wellfoundedness and ZF\n2. Wellfoundedness and ZF\n\n\nThe axioms of ZF are motivated by the second point of view \u2013 in\nfact by a very specific school of it: the view that the key is not\nmere noncircularity of \\(\\in\\) but wellfoundedness.\nA set \\(x\\) is wellfounded if there are no infinite sequences\n\\(\\ldots x_n \\in x_{n-1} \\in \\ldots x_3 \\in x_2 \\in x_1\\). The axioms\nof ZF can usefully be thought of as arising from an attempt to\naxiomatise the theory of wellfounded sets.  This project has been so\nsuccessful that nowadays many people believe that wellfounded sets are\nthe only kind of set there is \u2013 if it isn\u2019t wellfounded it\nisn\u2019t a set but a hyperset perhaps. This idea is a\nmodern rewriting of history: Set theory did not\nstart with the idea that all sets should be wellfounded (had\nit done so, the axiom scheme of na\u00efve comprehension would never\nhave been entertained!) The idea that we should admit a candidate set\nas a genuine set only if promises to be wellfounded is an overreaction\nto the uncontroversial observation that the suspect collections that\nfeature in the paradoxes (the universe, the Russell class) are all\nflagrantly illfounded, or at least would be if they existed. It is\neasy to jump from this insight to the conclusion that wellfoundedness\nof \\(\\in\\) is the only thing that matters. The result of this jump is\nZF set theory.\n\n\nBut historically-wrong and philosophically-hasty does not imply\nunproductive. There is no doubt that restricting attention to\nwellfounded sets (in the sense that it is them alone that one tries to\naxiomatise) concentrated the minds of 20th century mathematicians to\ngreat effect. ZF does seem to avoid the paradoxes, and the conception\nof set it formalises is one that apparently allows one to interpret the\nwhole of mathematics. But how can an historically wrong and\nphilosophically hasty story have such a happy ending? The answer is\nthat, although it may be a mistake to think that all sets are\nwellfounded, it is not a mistake to think that the concept of\nwellfounded set is worth axiomatising.\n",
