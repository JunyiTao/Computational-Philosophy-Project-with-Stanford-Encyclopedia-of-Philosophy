    "main_text": "Significant Interactions Between Modalities || Agents\n4.4 Agents\n\nIn the context of the design and implementation of autonomous agents,\none of the most famous architectures is the\nbelief-desire-intention (BDI) model (Bratman 1987;\nHerzig, Lorini, Perrussel, & Xiao 2017).\n\nDeveloped initially as a model of human practical reasoning (Bratman\n1987), the BDI model proposes an explanation of practical\nreasoning involving action, intention, belief, goal, will,\ndeliberation and several other concepts. Thus, it is natural to think\nabout combining simple modal logics for some of these notions in order\nto define logics for such richer settings. Indeed, several formal\nsemantics for such models have been proposed, some of them based on\ndiverse temporal logics (Cohen & Levesque 1990; Governatori,\nPadmanabhan, & Sattar 2002; Rao & Georgeff 1991), some others\nbased on dynamic logics (van der Hoek, van Linder, & Meyer 1999;\nSingh 1998), and some based on both (Wooldridge 2000). The crucial\npart in most of them is the interaction between these different\nattitudes. For example, on the one hand, if an agent intends to\nachieve something (say, \\(I\\varphi)\\), one would expect for her to\ndesire that something \\((D\\varphi)\\); otherwise, it does not make\nsense to devote resources to achieve it. On the other hand, desiring\nsomething should not imply an intention to achieve it: it does not\nseem reasonable to commit resources to all our desires, even the\nunrealistic ones (and, perhaps more importantly, intention and desires\nwould collapse into a single notion). Moreover, it seems clear that an\nagent who desires to be rich \\((Dr)\\) does not necessarily believe\nthat she is rich \\((Br)\\). Finally, if an agent has an intention to\nwrite a book \\((Ib)\\), should she believe that she will write it\n\\((BFb)\\), thus ruling out all possible unforeseen circumstances that\ncould prevent her from doing it?\n\nA concise description of this interaction in some of these proposals\ncan be found in the first part of\n Subsection 4.2\n in the SEP entry on\n the logic of action\n written by Segerberg, Meyer, and Kracht (2016).\n",
