    "main_text": "Range of Meanings and Uses || Etymological meaning of retributivism\n3.1 Etymological meaning of retributivism\n\nAs Didier Fassin (2018: 47) explains: \n\n\nretribution \u2026 comes from Latin \u2026\nretribuere [which] is composed of the prefix re-,\n\u201cin return\u201d, and tribuere, literally \u201cto\ndivide among tribes\u201d. \n\n\nFassin\u2019s point is that the root meaning traces to a tort-like\nidea, that when members of one tribe harm members of another, they\nhave to pay compensation to keep the peace.\n\nSeeing the root idea in this way helps to highlight a peculiar feature\nof the modern idea. There is something morally straightforward in the\nolder idea that if members of one group harm members of another, then\nthe harmed group could demand compensation. There is something at\nleast mysterious, however, in the modern thought that an individual\ncould owe suffering punishment to his fellow citizens for\nhaving committed a wrong. How does his suffering punishment \u201cpay\nhis debt to society\u201d?\n\nImportant as it is to recognize this question, it is also important to\nrecognize that the concept of retributive justice has evolved, and any\nquest for its justification must start with the thought that the core\nof the concept is no longer debt repayment but deserved\npunishment.\n",
