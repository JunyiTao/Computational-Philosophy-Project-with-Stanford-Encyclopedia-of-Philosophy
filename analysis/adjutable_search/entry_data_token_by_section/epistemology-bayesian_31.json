    "main_text": "The Problem of Idealization || De-idealization and Understanding\n6.1 De-idealization and Understanding\n\nOne reply to the problem of idealization is to look at how idealized\nmodels are used and valued in science, and to argue that certain\nvalues of idealization can be carried over to epistemology. When a\nscientist studies a complex system, she might not really need an\naccurate description of it but might rather want to pursue the\nfollowing:\n\nsome simplified, idealized models of the whole (such as a block\nsliding on a frictionless, perfectly flat plane in vacuum);\ngradual de-idealizations of the above (such as adding more and\nmore realistic considerations about friction);\nan articulated reason why de-idealizations should be done this way\nrather than another to improve upon the simpler models.\n\n\nParts 1 and 2 do not have to be ladders that will be kicked away once\nwe reach a more realistic model. Instead, the three parts, 1\u20133,\nmight work together to help the scientist achieve a deeper\nunderstanding of the complex system under study\u2014a kind of\nunderstanding that an accurate description (alone) does not provide.\nThe above is one of the alleged values of idealized models in\nscientific modeling; for more, see section 4.2 of the entry on\n understanding\n and the survey by Elliott-Graves and Weisberg (2014: sec. 3). Some\nBayesians have argued that certain values of idealization are\napplicable not just in science but also in epistemology (Howson 2000:\n173\u2013177; Titelbaum 2013a: ch. 2\u20135; Schupbach 2018). For\nmore on the values of building more or less idealized models not just\nin epistemology but generally in philosophy, see T. Williamson\n(2017).\n\nThe above reply to the problem of idealization has been reinforced by\na sustained project of de-idealization in Bayesian epistemology. The\nfollowing gives you the flavor of how this project may be pursued.\nLet\u2019s start with the usual complaint that Probabilism\nimplies:\n\n\nStrong Normalization. An agent ought to assign\ncredence 1 to every logical truth.\n\n\n\nThe worry is that a person can meet this demand only by luck or with\nan unrealistic ability\u2014the ability to demarcate all logical\ntruths from the other propositions. But some Bayesians argue that the\nstandard version of Probabilism can be suitably de-idealized to obtain\na weak version that does not imply Strong Normalization. For example,\nthe extensibility version of Probabilism (discussed in\n section 3.1)\n permits one to have credence gaps and, thus, have no credence in any\nlogical truth (de Finetti 1970 [1974]; Jeffrey 1983; Zynda 1996).\nIndeed, the extensibility version of Probabilism only implies:\n\n\nWeak Normalization. It ought to be that, if an\nagent has a credence in a logical truth, that credence is equal to\n1.\n\n\n\nSome Bayesians have tried to de-idealize Probabilism further, to set\nit free from the commitment that any credence ought to be as sharp as\nan individual real number, precise to every digit. For example, Walley\n(1991: ch. 2 and 3) develops a version of Probabilism according to\nwhich a credence is permitted to be unsharp in this way. A credence\ncan be bounded by one or another interval of real numbers\nwithout being equal to any particular real number or any\nparticular interval\u2014even the tightest bound on a credence can be\nan incomplete description of that credence. This\ninterval-bound approach gives rise to a Dutch Book argument for an\neven weaker version of Probabilism, which only implies:\n\n\nVery Weak Normalization. It ought to be that,\nif an agent has a credence in a logical truth, then that credence is\nbounded only by intervals that include 1.\n\n\n\nSee\n supplement A\n for some non-technical details. For more details and related\ncontroversies, see the survey by Mahtani (2019) and the entry on\n imprecise probabilities.\n\nThe above are just some of the possible steps that might be taken in\nthe Bayesian project of de-idealization. There are more: Can Bayesians\nprovide norms for agents who can lose memories and forget what they\nused to take as certain? See Meacham (2010), Moss (2012), and\nTitelbaum (2013a: ch. 6 and 7) for positive accounts; also see\n section 5.4\n for discussion. Can Bayesians develop norms for agents who are\nsomewhat incoherent and incapable of being perfectly coherent? See\nStaffel (2019) for a positive account. Can Bayesians provide norms\neven for agents who are so cognitively underpowered that they only\nhave all-or-nothing beliefs without a numerical credence? See Lin\n(2013) for a positive account. Can Bayesians develop norms that\nexplain how one may be rationally uncertain whether one is rational?\nSee Dorst (2020) for a positive account. Can Bayesians develop a\ndiachronic norm for cognitively bounded agents? See Huttegger (2017a,\n2017b) for a positive account.\n\nWhile the project of de-idealization can be pursued gradually and\nincrementally as illustrated above, Bayesians disagree about how far\nthis project should be pursued. Some Bayesians want to push it\nfurther: they think that Very Weak Normalization is still too strong\nto be plausible, so Probabilism needs to be abandoned altogether and\nreplaced by a norm that permits credences less than 1 in logical\ntruths. For example, Garber (1983) tries to do that for certain\nlogical truths; Hacking (1967) and Talbott (2016), for all logical\ntruths. On the other hand, Bayesians of the more traditional variety\nretain a more or less de-idealized version of Probabilism, and try to\ndefend it by clarifying its normative content, to which I now\nturn.\n",
