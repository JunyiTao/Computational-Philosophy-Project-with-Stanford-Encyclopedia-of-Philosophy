    "main_text": "Art, Aesthetics, and Poetics\n6. Art, Aesthetics, and Poetics\n\nBildung and philosophy, as education to self-responsibility,\nare closely related to the realm of art. There are at least two\ndimensions of this relationship. First, Novalis is well aware that\nBildung, the call to self-understanding and autonomy through\nan engagement with tradition and other cultures, cannot proceed by way\nof an appeal to formal methodology. No rule can ever guarantee the\nsuccessful outcome of the individual\u2019s education in culture.\nRather, it is a matter of moving from the particular to the universal,\nbut without a universal at hand by which this move can be justified.\nWhat is required is a context-sensitive judgment. The process of\nBildung is itself an art (Kunst) in the sense that\nit takes tact or reflective judgment (such a use of the term\n\u201cart,\u201d as opposed to merely mechanical processes, was\nfairly common at the time and can also be found in the work of Herder,\nKant, and Schleiermacher). Along these lines, Novalis speaks of the\nwill to Fichtecize artistically (LFI #11), and also criticizes Fichte\nand Kant for being unpoetic (AB #924). The second sense in which art,\nphilosophy, and Bildung are related has to do with art being\none of the media, maybe even the privileged medium, through which\nBildung is achieved. In this context, it is important to keep\nin mind that as far as the philosophy of art goes, Novalis\u2019s\nperiod is one of transition. Around this time, aesthetics, as a\nKantian investigation into the validity-claim of the pure judgment of\ntaste, is established as an autonomous philosophical discipline with\nthe Critique of Judgment. Yet it is nonetheless the case that\nhistorical and intercultural engagement was, until and throughout this\nperiod, largely a matter of studying religious and cultural artefacts\nfrom temporally or geographically distant eras. These objects were not\nnecessarily approached aesthetically\u2014that is, subjected to pure\naesthetic judgment in Kant\u2019s meaning of the term\u2014but also,\nas in the works of Herder and Hegel, viewed as part of the larger\nfabric of the moral sciences. Novalis often leans in this direction,\nand at one point even follows Herder in addressing aesthetics as a\npsychological discipline (AB #423).\n\nNovalis\u2019s philosophy of art does not only lead to a recognition\nof the value of intertemporal and intercultural understanding. In\nfact, in a work such as Walter Benjamin\u2019s study of the romantic\nnotion of criticism, one encounters the idea that romantic aesthetics\nrepresents a proto-modernist theory of art.\n\nIn line with his general philosophy of history, Novalis contrasts\nmodern art to the art of ancient cultures. As opposed to ancient art,\nwhich was afforded a direct moral and religious relevance, modern art\nreflects its status as art. Or, stronger still, modern art sees itself\nas art only\u2014yet, precisely as art (only) can it give voice and\nexpression to experiences that cannot be grasped by a\npost-Enlightened, philosophical reason. As part of the Schillerian era\nof sentimentality, modern philosophy mourns the absence of a\npre-subjective, pre-reflexive anchoring of reason. Herein consists the\nso-called homesickness of philosophy (AB #857). Modern philosophy\nlongs for a principle that can shore up thought and subjectivity by\nreference to a dimension of being that is ontologically prior to it.\nGiven its discursive nature, philosophy is constitutively cut-off from\nsuch an absolute grounding. Art, however, can testify to this\ndimension of being; it can express what modern philosophy wants, yet\nis painfully aware that it cannot get. In this sense, \u201cthe poet\nis the transcendental physician,\u201d as Novalis provocatively puts\nit (LFI #36). Given its linguistic nature, poetry in particular should\nstrive to realize its own inherent potential rather than imitating\nphilosophy and other discursive forms of expression.\n\nNovalis\u2019s understanding of art in general and literature in\nparticular is perhaps best articulated\u2014or, rather,\nexemplified\u2014in a novel such as Heinrich von\nOfterdingen. Though unfinished, the novel, which includes ample\nmeta-reflections on aesthetic matters, illustrates the dream-like\natmosphere that has made Novalis\u2019s work the prime example of\nmagical idealism, the romantic prism through which nature itself\noccurs as a work of art, as being expressive of a deeper meaning and\nperfection that defuses the possible tension between necessity and\nfreedom, sensuousness and understanding, and gives human beings a\nsense of belonging and being at home in the world.\n",
