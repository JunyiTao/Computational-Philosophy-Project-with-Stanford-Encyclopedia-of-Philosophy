    "main_text": "Epistemology and history\n3. Epistemology and history\n\nVives was pessimistic about the possibility of attaining knowledge as\nunderstood in Aristotelian terms; and his thought anticipates the\nmoderate skepticism of early modern philosophers such as Francisco\nSanches (1551\u20131623) and Pierre Gassendi (1592\u20131655). Vives\nbelongs, like Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626), to the so-called\n\u201cmaker\u2019s knowledge\u201d tradition, which regards\nknowledge as a kind of making or as a capacity to make (see A.\nP\u00e9rez-Ramos, Francis Bacon\u2019s Idea of Science and the\nMaker\u2019s Knowledge Tradition, Oxford and New York: Clarendon\nPress and Oxford University Press, 1988). He often insists on the\npractical nature of knowledge; for instance, in De causis\ncorruptarum artium, he maintains that peasants and artisans know\nnature far better than many philosophers (VI, 190). In Satellitium\nanimi (The Soul\u2019s Escort, 1524), a collection of\naphorisms dedicated to Princess Mary, he points out that \u201cman\nknows as far as he can make\u201d (IV, 63). A central tenet of the\nmaker\u2019s knowledge tradition is that man cannot gain access to\nnature\u2019s intimate works, since these, as opera divina\n(divine works), are only known to God, their maker.\n\nAccording to Vives, things have two different layers: one external,\nconsisting in the sensible accidents of the thing, and another,\ninternal, and therefore hidden, which is the essence of the thing\n(III, 197). \u201cThe true and genuine essences of all things\u201d,\nhe writes, \u201care not known by us in themselves. They hide\nconcealed in the innermost part of each thing where our mind, enclosed\nby the bulk of the body and the darkness of life, cannot\npenetrate\u201d (III, 406\u20137). Vives subscribes to the\nAristotelian principle that all of our knowledge has its origin in\nperception. We cannot learn anything, he maintains, except through the\nsenses (III, 193 and 378). But he also maintains that the human mind\n\u201cmust realize that, since it is locked up in a dark prison and\nsurrounded by obscurity, it is prevented from understanding many\nthings and cannot clearly observe or know what it wants: neither the\nconcealed essence of material things, nor the quality and character of\nimmaterial things; nor can it, on account of the gloom of the body,\nuse its acuity and swiftness\u201d (III, 329). In other words, since\nthe senses cannot grasp what is incorporeal or hidden, sense\nperception does not yield any knowledge of the essence of things but\nonly of their accidents. Vives\u2019 view, however, is that sensory\nknowledge must nonetheless be transcended by means of reasoning. Yet,\naccording to him, the best that human reason can accomplish in this\nprocess is to provide a judgment grounded in all the available\nevidence, thereby increasing the probability of the conclusion. In his\nview, our knowledge of the essence of a thing is only an approximate\nguess based on the sensible operations of the thing in question (III,\n122).\n\nThe most reliable guide for human inquiry, he argues, is\nmankind\u2019s natural propensity toward what is good and true. This\nlight of our mind, as he also calls it, is always, directly or\nindirectly, inclined toward what is good and true, and can be regarded\nas the beginning and origin of prudence and of all sciences and arts.\nThis natural propensity can be perfected if it is subjected to\nteaching and exercise, just as the seeds of plants grow better if they\nare cultivated by the industrious hands of a farmer. He found\nphilosophical grounds for this idea in Cicero\u2019s report (see,\ne.g., De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods),\nI.43\u20135) of the Hellenistic theory of anticipationes\n(anticipations) and of naturales informationes (natural\nnotions), which we have not learned from teachers or custom, but are\ninstead derived and received from nature (III, 356\u20137). The\ntopics, which Vives conceives as a reflection of the ontological\norder, represent another valuable instrument for human inquiry. In his\nview, the topics are a set of universal aspects of things that help to\nbring order to the great variety of nature. As such, they play an\nimportant role as organizing principles of knowledge. They are like a\ngrid through which knowledge can be acquired and arguments formulated\n(see Nauta, 2015). Nevertheless, human knowledge can be nothing other\nthan a finite participation in creation. Because of the limitations\nthat characterize man\u2019s fallen state, investigations into the\nrealm of nature can only lead to conjectures, and not to firm and\nindubitable knowledge, which we neither deserve nor need. In De\nprima philosophia, Vives writes: \u201chuman inquiry comes to\nconjectural conclusions, for we do not deserve certain knowledge\n(scientia), stained by sin as we are and hence burdened with\nthe great weight of the body; nor do we need it, for we see that man\nis ordained lord and master of everything in the sublunary\nworld\u201d (III, 188). In his opinion, certainty is not a\nprerequisite for advances in science and philosophy; and as a\ncriterion for scientific progress and for the rational conduct of\nlife, he advocates a method consisting in sound judgment based on\nexperience.\n\nHistory, seen as the sum of all human experience, is therefore of\ngreat importance for all branches of learning. In De tradendis\ndisciplinis, Vives maintains that \u201chistory appears to\nsurpass all disciplines, since it either gives birth to or nourishes,\ndevelops [and] cultivates all arts\u201d (VI, 291). In this sense,\nhistory is not primarily regarded as the memory of great deeds or the\nsource of useful examples, but as a process of development. In\nprinciple, every new generation is better equipped than the preceding\none, since it can derive advantage from all earlier experience:\n\u201cIt is therefore clear \u2013 he maintains \u2013 that if only\nwe apply our minds sufficiently, we can formulate better opinions\nabout matters of life and nature than could Aristotle, Plato, or any\nof the ancients\u201d (VI, 6\u20137). According to Vives, the saying\n\u201cwe are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants\u201d is plainly\nfalse. We are not dwarfs, nor were they giants. All humans are\ncomposed of the same structure (VI, 39). The idea of progress plays an\nessential role in Vives\u2019 conception of intellectual history, and\nseveral of the cultural problems he deals with, such as the causes of\nthe corruption of the arts, are approached from an historical\nperspective.\n",
