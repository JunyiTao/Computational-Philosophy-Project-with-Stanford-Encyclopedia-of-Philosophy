    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nTwo preliminary observations about the Japanese cultural tradition are\nrelevant to the arts. First, classical Japanese philosophy understands\nreality as constant change, or (to use a Buddhist expression)\nimpermanence. The world of flux that presents itself to our\nsenses is the only reality: there is no conception of some stable\n\u201cPlatonic\u201d realm above or behind it. The arts in Japan\nhave traditionally reflected this fundamental\nimpermanence\u2014sometimes lamenting but more often celebrating it.\nThe idea of muj\u014d (impermanence) is perhaps most\nforcefully expressed in the writings and sayings of the\nthirteenth-century Zen master D\u014dgen, who is arguably\nJapan\u2019s profoundest philosopher, but there is a fine expression\nof it by a later Buddhist priest, Yoshida Kenk\u014d, whose Essays\nin Idleness (Tsurezuregusa, 1332) sparkles with\naesthetic insights:\n\nIt does not matter how young or strong you may be, the hour of death\ncomes sooner than you expect. It is an extraordinary miracle that you\nshould have escaped to this day; do you suppose you have even the\nbriefest respite in which to relax? (Keene, 120)\n\n\nIn the Japanese Buddhist tradition, awareness of the fundamental\ncondition of existence is no cause for nihilistic despair, but rather\na call to vital activity in the present moment and to gratitude for\nanother moment\u2019s being granted to us.\n\nThe second observation is that the arts in Japan have tended to be\nclosely connected with Confucian practices of self-cultivation, as\nevidenced in the fact that they are often referred to as \u201cways\n[of living]\u201d: chad\u014d, the way of tea (tea\nceremony), shod\u014d, the way of writing (calligraphy), and\nso forth. And since the scholar official in China was expected to be\nskilled in the \u201cSix Arts\u201d\u2014ceremonial ritual, music,\ncalligraphy, mathematics, archery, and charioteering\u2014culture and\nthe arts tend to be more closely connected with intellect and the life\nof the mind than in the western traditions.\n\nTo this day it is not unusual in Japan for the scholar to be a fine\ncalligrapher and an accomplished poet in addition to possessing the\npertinent intellectual abilities.\n",
