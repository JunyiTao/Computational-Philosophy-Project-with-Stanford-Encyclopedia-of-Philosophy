    "main_text": "The objective connection among truths: grounding (Abfolge)\n7. The objective connection among truths: grounding (Abfolge)\n\nThe Contributions of 1810 already contain speculation about\nan \u201cobjective connection among truths\u201d that is supposed to\nguide the organization and presentation of scientific knowledge.\nBolzano\u2019s discussion of this notion in the TS\nrepresents the last stage of his development of formal logic and is at\nthe same time the first modern study of axiomatic systems (\u00a7162,\n168 198\u2013222, 378; see also Bolzano 2004a, \u00a713, 14, 17, and\nthe other Bolzanian texts translated in Roski and Schnieder, 2022)\n.\n\nBolzano\u2019s idea of an objective order among truths has its origin\nin the Aristotelian distinction between proofs of the fact\nand those that yield the reason of the fact. His problem is\nthat of determining what should count as a proof of the second kind,\nthe sort that he calls an objective grounding of a truth.\nPreliminary to this inquiry is one in which he tries to characterize\nthe individual steps of such proofs in terms of the relation of\nground to consequence, which he calls Abfolge (also\ntranslated as \u2018grounding\u2019).\n\nFinding no satisfactory definition of grounding in the works of others\nand declaring himself unable to define the concept of grounding (or\nrather of a ground), he says that he is inclined to regard it as\nsimple (\u00a7202). In accordance with his methodology, he tries to at\nleast partially characterize the notion by stating a number of theses\nabout it that he considers to be true. To begin with, he claims that\nonly true propositions stand in the relation of ground to consequence.\nPerhaps unwisely, he assumes uniqueness: \u201cthere is only one\nobjective ground [for a given truth]\u201d (TS IV:\n\u00a7528; cf. \u00a7206). In many cases, the ground consists of a\ncollection of truths. The parts (members) of this collection are\ncalled partial grounds, the collection the complete or total ground.\nSimilarly, Bolzano distinguishes between the total and merely partial\nconsequences of a given ground. In modern terms, we would take the\nrelation he describes to be one that holds between two sets, an option\nnot open to Bolzano because, on his understanding, a collection must\ncontain at least two parts.\n\nGrounding is anti-transitive: If \\(\\Gamma\\) is the ground of\n\\(\\Delta\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) in turn the ground of \\(E\\), then \\(\\Gamma\\)\nis not the ground of \\(E\\), though we can speak of supporting\ntruths or, improperly, of remote grounds in such cases.\nGrounding is also anti-symmetrical and anti-reflexive. It should not\nbe confused with either deducibility or causality. Not with the former\nbecause deducibility holds among false as well as true propositions,\nis reflexive (for propositions that are not universally invalid wrt to\nthe variables of deduction), merely asymmetrical, and merely\nintransitive (being transitive, notably, in cases where the variables\nare the same). Nor with the latter, because the causal relation holds\nbetween actual objects, while grounding relates non-actual objects,\nnamely, true propositions in themselves. Causality and grounding are\nnonetheless connected, Bolzano thinks, taking claims of the form\n\u2018A causes B\u2019 to be analyzable as follows: \u2018[A\nexists] (partially) grounds [B exists]\u2019 (TS,\n\u00a7168).\n\nAlthough grounding is not a species of deducibility, Bolzano thinks\nthat there are cases in which a truth is both deducible from, and\ngrounded in, other truths. In some cases of this kind, he thinks, a\nrelation of ground to consequence also holds among the variants of the\noriginal propositions, provided only that the resulting propositions\nare all true. He speaks of formal grounding in such cases\n(TS,\u00a7162). Later, he cites the following example:\n[Socrates was an Athenian and a philosopher] is both grounded in and\ndeducible from [Socrates was an Athenian] and [Socrates was a\nphilosopher] (wrt [Socrates], [Athenian], and [philosopher]), and the\nsame holds, he clearly thinks, for all variants consisting of true\npropositions, e.g., [Nixon was a Republican and a crook], [Nixon was a\nRepublican], [Nixon was a crook] (TS, \u00a7199; cf.\n\u00a7221, no.7; and, for another example of formal grounding, see\n\u00a7226, no.5).\n\nBolzano maintains that there are truths that have no grounds, citing\nthe example [There is something]=[[Something] has objectuality]\n(TS, \u00a7 214). He calls them basic truths\n(Grundwahrheiten). He thinks that there must be more than one\nbasic truth, \u201cfor I cannot understand how from a single truth\nall others would follow either as consequences, or consequences of\nconsequences, etc.\u201d (\u00a7215). As in the\nContributions, Bolzano emphasizes that this is not an\nepistemic notion: in particular, basic truths need not be evident, and\nmay require proof in the sense of a certification.\n\nAssociated with each non-basic truth is a structured collection of\nsupporting truths (grounds, grounds of grounds, and so on). Bolzano\ndepicts such collections as trees (TS, \u00a7220). In some\ncases, dependence relations proceed ad infinitum , e.g., the\ngrounds of a truth describing a contingent state of a created\nsubstance (TS, \u00a7216). In others, the branches terminate\nin basic truths.\n\nBolzano\u2019s discussion in Volume 2 of TS ends with a few\nconjectures bearing especially on formal grounding relations among\npurely conceptual truths like those of mathematics (TS,\n\u00a7221). To begin with, he maintains that the grounds of non-basic\npurely conceptual truths always lie in other purely conceptual truths.\nWhen the consequence is deducible from the ground, there are no\nredundant premises (a condition satisfied, as we saw above, in cases\nof exact deducibility). In addition, the individual truths supporting\na purely conceptual truth are never more complex than it is. Each is,\nmoreover, the simplest among all propositions equivalent to it.\n(Bolzano uses these claims to argue that the grounding trees for\npurely conceptual truths are always finite.) They are also the most\ngeneral propositions from which the truth can be deduced.\n\nCombining these criteria, he proposed the following as a sufficient\ncondition for formal grounding: If the truth \\(M\\) is exactly\ndeducible from truths \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) with respect to \\(i, j,\n\\ldots\\), and \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are the simplest of all propositions\nequivalent to them (presumably again wrt \\(i, j, \\ldots\\)), and if\nnone of \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) is more complex than \\(M\\), then a\nrelation of formal grounding holds between \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) and\n\\(M\\) (\u00a7221, no.7).\n\nWhen these conditions are met systematically in the ordering of truths\nbelonging to a purely conceptual science, he conjectures further,\ndeductive efficiency is also maximized (\u00a7221, no. 3). Indeed, at\nthe end of \u00a7221, he entertains the thought that grounding might\nbe defined in terms of deductive efficiency:\n\n\nI occasionally doubt whether the concept of ground and consequence,\nwhich I have above claimed to be simple, is not complex after all; it\nmay turn out to be none other than the concept of an ordering of\ntruths which allows us to deduce from the smallest number of simple\npremises the largest possible number of the remaining truths as\nconclusions. (TS, \u00a7221, 388 note) \n\n\nRoski (2014: 370) sums up the general tendency of Bolzano\u2019s\nreflections as follows:\n\n\n[They are] partial answers to the question under what conditions a\ndeductive argument is explanatory [\u2026] On what I took to be the\nmost charitable reading of them, Bolzano\u2019s principles\nessentially boil down to the claim that a logically valid argument is\nexplanatory, only if there is no argument with fewer\npremises, for none of the premises is there a logically equivalent\nproposition that is simpler, and none of the premises is more complex\nthan the conclusion.[\u2026] These principles, I have maintained,\ncan be considered to be an explication of the idea that every premise\nand every concept in an explanatory argument is deductively relevant.\nMore importantly, they can be considered to be an explication of the\nidea that explanation ought to go in hand with some kind of\ntheoretical economy.\n\n\nCommentators have drawn attention to a number of shortcomings of\nBolzano\u2019s proposals (see, e.g., Mancosu, 1999, Rumberg, 2013,\nRoski, 2017). This would not have surprised him, since he was himself\naware that the above criteria could generate conflicts (see, e.g.,\n2004a, \u00a717), and had frankly admitted that his remarks about\ngrounding were tentative and incomplete, merely a first attempt to\ncircumscribe the concept:\n\n\nAlmost everything I advance in this part is tinged with uncertainty,\non many topics I have not reached any decision, and at best my\ninquiries are only fragments and suggestions which will have attained\ntheir goal if they provide others with the stimulus to reflect further\non these matters\u201d (TS II: \u00a7195, 327\u20138).\n\n",
