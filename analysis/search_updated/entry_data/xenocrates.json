    "preamble": "\n\nXenocrates (of Chalcedon, a city on the Asian side of the Bosporus\nopposite Byzantium, according to Diogenes Laertius (D.L.) iv 14),\nbecame head of the Academy after Speusippus died, in 339/338\n(\u201cin the second year of the 110th Olympiad\u201d). D.L. says he\nheld that position for twenty-five years, and died at 82. So his dates\nwork out to 396/395\u2013314/313.\n\nOn the death of Plato, when Speusippus became head of the Academy,\nXenocrates and Aristotle may have left Athens together at the\ninvitation of Hermeias of Atarneus (see Strabo XIII 57, printed in\nGaiser 1988, 380\u2013381, discussed at 384\u2013385), and\nXenocrates returned to succeed Speusippus. According to D.L. (iv 3),\nthis was at Speusippus\u2019 request, while the Academicorum Index\nHerculanensis (cols. VI-VII: Mekler 1902, 38\u201339, Gaiser\n1988, 193) tells us that the younger members of the Academy voted on\nthe succession and confirmed Xenocrates by a narrow margin. These two\naccounts, although not incompatible, do not tell the same story, and\nit does not appear\u00a0 possible to get behind them to what really\nhappened.\n\nD.L.\u2019s bibliography (iv 11\u201314) lists over 70 titles; nothing\nwhatever of these has survived, even in the form of identifiable\nquotations in other authors. Reconstruction of Xenocrates\u2019 views\nturns, as in the case of Speusippus, on Aristotle, and, again as in\nthe case of Speusippus, this is made the more difficult by Aristotle\u2019s\nfrequent failure actually to name Xenocrates when talking about his\nviews. In fact, Aristotle never mentions Xenocrates by name in\ndiscussing his metaphysical views.\n\nWhat is left of Xenocrates\u2019 views is here divided up under three\nheadings: Metaphysics, Theory of Knowledge, and Ethics. Sextus\nEmpiricus tells us (Adversus mathematicos vii 16; fr. 1H,\n82IP: here and in the sequel \u2018H\u2019 refers to the collection\nof fragments in Heinze 1892 and \u2018IP\u2019 to that in Isnardi\nParente 1982) that Xenocrates was explicit about the division of\nphilosophical topics implicit in Plato, into \u2018physics\u2019,\n\u2018ethics\u2019, and \u2018logic\u2019; this became the norm in\nStoicism and Hellenistic philosophy in general. We have a great deal\nmore to work with under the first heading than under the other two. As\nis standard with this terminology, what we are accustomed to refer to\nas metaphysics and theory of knowledge are included in\n\u2018physics\u2019 and \u2018logic\u2019, respectively.\n\nSextus\u2019 report about the standard division of philosophy coming\nthrough Xenocrates but ultimately from Plato is typical of much of\nwhat we hear about Xenocrates: he appears to have been at least as\nconcerned to carry on the thought of Plato as to promulgate ideas of\nhis own.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Metaphysics\n\nMost of what we can reconstruct about Xenocrates pertains to his\nmetaphysics. We do this largely by identifying views of his that\nappear in Aristotle\u2019s criticisms of the metaphysical views of his\npredecessors and contemporaries, and chaining together with these\nother texts that can plausibly be taken as dealing with his views. But\nthere are a few sources other than Aristotle.\n\nOne of them is Proclus, who says, commenting on the\nParmenides (Cousin 1864, 888.11\u201319, 36\u201338; fr.\n30H, 94IP):\n\nBut to the ideas both belonged: both to be intelligible and {to be}\nunchanging in substance, \u2018mounted on a holy pedestal\u2019,\nthat is, on pure mind, being such as to complete the things that are\nin potentiality and being causes that give them their form; whence\n{Plato} going up to these principles makes the whole of coming-to-be\ndependent on them, just as Xenocrates says, positing that the idea is\na paradigmatic cause of the {things} that are always constituted\naccording to nature \u2026\u00a0. Xenocrates, then, wrote down this\ndefinition of the idea as in conformity with the founder, positing it\nas a separate and divine cause; \u2026\n\n\n\u2018The founder\u2019 is Plato. The phrase \u2018mounted on a\nholy pedestal\u2019 comes from Plato, Phaedrus 254b7, where\nthe soul has been likened to a charioteer who sees the Forms of the\nbeautiful and temperance so mounted. Some of the phrasing is no doubt\nneoplatonist rather than Xenocratean, but the formulation, \u2018the\nidea is a paradigmatic cause\u2019, seems to be, as Proclus says,\nXenocrates\u2019 attempt to capture Plato\u2019s intent: see here Plato,\nParmenides 132d.\n\nThere is disagreement over the rest of the formulation Proclus\nattributes to Xenocrates: in speaking of \u2018the things that are\nalways constituted according to nature\u2019, did Xenocrates intend\nto rule out forms for individuals, which are transitory, and for\nartefacts, which are not constituted according to nature? This is the\nway Proclus goes on to interpret Xenocrates, and it is hard to see how\nto get around that, although attempts have been made (see Cherniss\n1944 [1962], 256). But there is indirect confirmation of Proclus\u2019\ninterpretation, at least where artefacts are concerned, from Clement\nof Alexandria, who tells us (in Stromateis II 5) that\nXenocrates claimed that knowledge of the intelligible substance is\ntheoretical as opposed to practical \u2018judgment\u2019; at that\nrate, carpenters are not contemplating forms when they make beds and\nshuttles, despite what is said by Plato in Republic X 596b\nand Cratylus 389a\u2013b, and (if it is by Plato) Letter\nvii 342d. But it should be noted that the rejection of forms for\nartefacts is in agreement with what Aristotle has to say about Plato\nand Platonists in Metaphysics I 9. 991b6\u20137, XII 3.\n1070a13\u201319, and in the fragmentary remains of On Ideas\nin Alexander (see esp. Hayduck 1891, 79.23\u201324, 80.6). Likewise\nthe rejection of forms for individuals squares with Aristotle\u2019s attack\non the \u2018argument from thinking\u2019 (Metaphysics I 9.\n990b14\u201315 = XIII 4. 1079a10\u201311, supplemented by Alexander,\nHayduck 1891, 81.25\u201382.7): if every object of thought is a form,\nthen there are forms also \u201cfor the perishables\u201d (990b14 =\n1079b10) or \u201cfor the particulars and perishables, such as\nSocrates, Plato\u201d (Alexander, Hayduck 1891, 82.2\u20133).\n\nThe version of the Theory of Forms associated with Xenocrates is that\nwhich Aristotle ascribes to the later Plato (see Metaphysics\nXIII 4. 1078b10\u201312 for the qualification \u2018later\u2019),\nin which the Forms are \u2018generated\u2019 and are, in the first\ninstance, numbers. Xenocrates operated, in parallel with Speusippus\nand Plato (as Aristotle reports Plato), with a scheme in which two\nprinciples--the One and something called any or all of \u2018the\neverflowing\u2019, \u2018plurality\u2019 (A\u00ebtius i 3. 23), or\n\u2018the Indefinite Dyad\u2019 (Theophrastus, Metaphysics\nvi)--generate these form-numbers, and then, in turn, lines, planes,\nsolids, and perceptible things.\n\nThe talk of generation Xenocrates reinterpreted as a mere pedagogical\ndevice; we hear about this technique from Aristotle, De caelo\nI 10. 279b32\u2013280a2, and Simplicius\u2019 commentary ad loc. (Heiberg\n1893, 303.33\u201334) names Xenocrates in this connection, as does\nPlutarch (De animae procreatione in Timaeo 3. 1013a\u2013b,\nCherniss 1976, 168\u2013171). Here it is a device for interpreting\nthe creation story in the Timaeus; that Xenocrates also\napplied it to the generation of the formal numbers we learn from\nAristotle, Metaphysics XIV 4. 1091a28\u201329 and the\ncommentary on that passage in pseudo-Alexander (Hayduck 1891,\n819.37\u2013820.3).\n\nIn trying to understand what Aristotle tells us about formal numbers,\nit is necessary to bear in mind the fundamental distinction he draws\nbetween formal numbers and mathematical numbers: both are, according\nto Aristotle, composed of units, but formal numbers are composed of\nvery strange units, such that those in one formal number cannot be\ncombined with those in any other. The units of which mathematical\nnumbers are composed can be added and subtracted freely. (See here\nMetaphysics XIII 6. 1080a15\u2013b4.) And furthermore there\nis only one formal number for each of the numbers 2, 3, 4, etc., where\nthere are indefinitely many instances of each among the mathematical\nnumbers. (See here Metaphysics I 6. 987b14\u201318.) The\nmathematical numbers are the ones mathematicians work with, e.g. in\nperforming arithmetical operations, and that is presumably why they\nare called \u2018mathematical\u2019. There is a corresponding\ndivision between types of geometrical figures, but we hear too little\nabout this; most of what follows will be concerned with numbers.\n\nThe position that there are both formal numbers and mathematical\nnumbers Aristotle ascribes to Plato. Speusippus rejects the formal\nnumbers (and the entire theory of forms along with them; see the entry\non\n Speusippus).\n The position Aristotle ascribes to Xenocrates is a bit more\nelusive.\n\nIn Metaphysics VII 2, Aristotle tells us, in\n1028b19\u201321, that Plato accepted three sorts of entities: forms,\nmathematicals, and perceptibles; in this context that means formal\nnumbers, mathematical numbers, and perceptibles. He then, in\nb21\u201324, talks about Speusippus\u2019 views (see the entry on\n Speusippus).\n In both cases he gives us the names. Then, in b24\u201327 he says\nthis:\n\nBut some say that the forms and the numbers have the same nature,\nwhile the others, lines and planes, come next, {and so on} down to the\nsubstance of the heavens and to the perceptibles.\n\n\nAsclepius\u2019 commentary on this passage (Hayduck 1888, 379.17\u201322)\ntells us that it is dealing with Xenocrates.\n\nThe core of Xenocrates\u2019 view is that \u201cthe forms and the numbers\nhave the same nature:\u201d that is, the formal numbers and the\nmathematical numbers have the same nature. A series of half a dozen\npassages in the Metaphysics can, in consequence of this\nidentification, be associated with Xenocrates (see XII 1.\n1069a30\u2013b2, XIII 1. 1076a20, 6. 1080b21\u201330, 8.\n1083b1\u20138, 9. 1086a5\u201311, XIV 3. 1090b13\u20131091a5). From\nthese passages it appears that he is saying that the distinction\nbetween formal and mathematical numbers (as well as the corresponding\ndistinction among geometrical objects) is unnecessary; he does this by\nassimilating mathematical numbers to form-numbers and telling us that\nmathematics can be done entirely with formal numbers. In other words,\nsince he thinks that mathematics can be done with formal numbers, he\nfeels it acceptable to call formal numbers mathematical numbers.\n\n1086a5\u20139 makes it sound as if some part of Xenocrates\u2019 case for\nhis position was based on the consideration that all that can be based\non the two ultimate principles, the One and the Indefinite Dyad, is\nthe series of formal numbers. Without some further comment, it is hard\nto see much of an argument here, but we may be able to piece together\na little about the relationship of the numbers to the One. In Eudemian\nEthics (I 8. 1218a24\u201333) Aristotle attacks an Academic\n\u2018demonstration\u2019\u00a0 aimed at showing that The One is the\ngood itself, i.e the Idea of the good. He calls it\n\u2018tricky\u2019 or \u2018bizarre\u2019 (translations of\nparabolos vary considerably), and it is indeed bizarre: from the\npremises that the numbers aim for unification and that \u201call the\nthings that are aim for some one good\u201d it concludes that the\ngood itself must be the One. As it stands, this is gappy, but what is\nreally bizzare is the first premise, that numbers strive to get their\nunits to stick together; that is too much for Aristotle (and no doubt\nfor the rest of us as well).\n\n\nIn the passage of Proclus\u2019 Parmenides commentary cited above\nthere appears a passage dealing with a view that makes the\nparticipants in an Idea \u2018aim for\u2019 that Idea, which in turn\naims for that which \u2018comes before\u2019 it, which must be the\nOne. So Xenocrates looks to be the source for the\n\u2018bizarre\u2019 demonstration, and if so he is invoking final\ncausality in relating the forms (which are formal numbers) to the One.\nAristotle himself has the heavenly spheres move as they do out of a\ndesire to emulate the unmoved mover (Metaphysics XII 7. 1072a26-b4),\nand even says that the matter in a form/matter compound \u2018aims\nat\u2019 its form (Physics I 9. 192a16\u201325), so this use of final\ncausality was, one supposes, Academic. But about Xenocrates\u2019\n\u2018demonstration\u2019 Aristotle is merciless: \u201cone should\n\u2026 not without reason give any credit at all to things it is not\neasy to believe even with reason\u201d.\n\nIt may help a little, but not a lot, to notice that Xenocrates makes\n(see below) the soul is a self-moving number.  In any case, the\nresulting position is possibly quite unstable: Aristotle certainly\nthinks so. For Plato and Speusippus, the addition of 2 and 3 is a\nmatter of putting together a group of units that is a mathematical 2\nwith a disjoint group of units that is a mathematical 3 (that numbers\nare such collections of units is a view that can still be found later,\nperhaps most importantly, given his influence, in\nEuclid, Elements VII def. 2). Aristotle, too, understood\naddition in this way, although with a completely different take on the\nunderlying ontology. We do not know how Xenocrates understood\naddition: perhaps as a sort of map telling you that if you are on the\nunique formal number 2 and you want to add the unique formal number 3\nto it, you cannot, strictly speaking, do that, but taking three steps\non in the series will get you to the unique formal number 5, and that\nis what \u20182 + 3 = 5\u2019 really means. There is, as far as I\nknow, no evidence to support this conjecture, but it has the advantage\nof explaining Aristotle\u2019s complaint, voiced more than once in\nthe passages cited (see 1080b28\u201330, 1083b4\u20136,\n1086a9\u201311), that Xenocrates actually makes doing mathematics\nimpossible: he ends up destroying mathematical number, and if the\nabove guess should be correct about Xenocrates\u2019 handling of\naddition, it is readily seen how someone of Aristotle\u2019s\npersuasion might think that Xenocrates is not so much explaining\naddition as explaining it away.\n\nAristotle complains in 1080b28\u201330 that on Xenocrates\u2019 view\nit is not so that every two units make up a pair, and also that on his\nview not every geometrical magnitude divides into smaller\nmagnitudes. This has to do with Xenocrates\u2019 acceptance of the\nidea that there are indivisible lines; this idea Aristotle ascribes to\nPlato in\nMetaphysics I 9. 992a20\u201322, and Alexander\u2019s commentary\non that passage adds the name Xenocrates, in a way that suggests that\nXenocrates\u2019 acceptance of indivisible magnitudes was even better known\nthan Plato\u2019s (Hayduck 1891, 120.6\u20137; see also Simplicius on\nDe caelo, Heiberg 1894, 563.21\u201322 and many other\npassages in the commentators in which this ascription occurs: frs.\n41\u201349H, 123\u2013147IP). As Proclus understood Xenocrates\u2019\nposition, it applied to the Form of the line rather than to\ngeometrical or physical magnitudes (see Diehl 1904,\n245.30\u2013246.4), but this is very much a minority view: Porphyry\nis quoted by Simplicius in the latter\u2019s commentary on the\nPhysics (Diels 1882, 140.9\u201313) as saying that,\naccording to Xenocrates, what is:\n\n\u2026 is not divisible ad infinitum, but {division} stops\nat certain indivisibles {atoma}. But these are not\nindivisible as partless and least {magnitudes}, but while they are\ncuttable with respect to quantity and matter and have parts, in form\nthey are indivisible and primary; he supposed that there were certain\nprimary indivisible lines and primary planes and solids composed out\nof them.\n\n\nThis suggests that Xenocrates might have thought he could do with the\nnotion of a line what Aristotle was prepared to do with\nnotions such as man. Aristotle is prepared to say that a man\nis indivisible, and so a suitable unit for the arithmetician\u2019s\ncontemplation, in the sense that if you divide a man into two parts\nwhat you get is not two men (see Metaphysics XIII 3.\n1078a23\u201326). Xenocrates may have thought the notion of a line\ncould be made to work in the same way: beyond a certain point,\ndivisions will no longer yield lines. It is difficult to think how he\ncould have made this plausible; once again, one can see why Aristotle\nmight have regarded Xenocrates\u2019 position as unmathematical.\n\nXenocrates\u2019 espousal of indivisible magnitudes has led to the\nconjecture that the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise On Indivisible\nLines is at least in part an attack on him, and that the\narguments recounted in its first chapter in favor of the claim that\nthere are indivisible lines, which are rebutted in the sequel, might\ncome from Xenocrates. Unfortunately, those arguments are quite\nobscure, and the text itself is not in very good shape (an admirably\nconcise summary of the first four of these arguments may be found in\nFurley 1967, 105). But some of the arguments owe a lot to Zeno of\nElea: that Xenocrates was influenced by Zeno is only what one would\nexpect, and is confirmed elsewhere (see esp. the passage from Porphyry\ncited in part above, apud Simplicius on the Physics,\nDiels 1882, 140.6\u201318).\n\nIn the passage of Metaphysics VII 2 quoted above, after we\nget the identification of formal and mathematical numbers, with the\nformal numbers actually carrying the weight, there is a brief\ndescription of the rest of the universe: \u201cwhile the others,\nlines and planes, come next, {and so on} down to the substance of the\nheavens and to the perceptibles.\u201d It appears that Xenocrates\npictured the universe as unfolding in the sequence: (1) forms =\nnumbers; (2) lines; (3) planes; (4) solids; (5) solids in motion, i.e.\nastronomical bodies; \u2026; (n) ordinary perceptible things. Solid\nshapes aren\u2019t mentioned in this sentence, but they were earlier, in\n1028b17\u201318, and they are a standard stage in this sequence.\n\nThere is here an implicit contrast between Xenocrates and Speusippus,\nwhose universe was to Aristotle discontinuous or disjointed:\nXenocrates\u2019 universe is at least a more orderly one (see the entry on\n Speusippus).\n And something like this rather faint praise is echoed in\nTheophrastus\u2019 Metaphysics. Theophrastus complains that\nPythagoreans and Platonists fail to give us a full story about the\nconstruction of the universe: they just go so far and stop\n(6a15\u2013b6). Then he says (6b6\u20139):\n\nand none of the others {does any different} except Xenocrates: for he\nplaces all things somehow around the world-order, alike perceptibles\nand intelligibles, i.e. mathematicals, and again even the divine\n{things}.\n\n\nSo we have it from Aristotle that Xenocrates\u2019 universe showed\ncontinuity, and from Theophrastus that it covered everything. Of\ncourse, we do not know how.\n\nExactly what Theophrastus means by \u2018the divine things\u2019 is\nhard to say. There are two candidates: the objects of astronomical\nstudies, which would connect with Aristotle\u2019s account, or those of\ntheological studies, about which Xenocrates also had much to say.\nThese are not exclusive candidates. A passage in A\u00ebtius (Diels\n1879, 304b1\u201314) tells us that Xenocrates took the \u2018unit\nand the dyad\u2019 to be gods, the first male and the second female,\nand also thought of the heavenly bodies as gods; in addition he\nsupposed there were sublunary daimones. These latter were\nbeings intermediary between gods and men, also mentioned in Plato,\nSymposium 202d\u2013203a.\n\nWe hear more about the gods, daimones, and men from Plutarch,\nwho tells us (De defectu oraculorum 416c\u2013d, Babbitt\n1936, 386\u2013387) that Xenocrates associated them with types of\ntriangle: gods with equilateral ones, daimones with isosceles\nones, and men with scalene triangles: as isosceles triangles are\nintermediate between equilateral ones and scalene ones, so\ndaimones are intermediate between gods and men. According to\nPlutarch (417b, De Iside et Osiride 360d\u2013f: in Babbitt\n1936, 390\u2013391 and 58\u201361, respectively.), Xenocrates\u2019\ndaimones come in good and bad varieties: they may have had\nsomething to do with the explanation of the existence of evil.\n\nIn addition, there are isolated snatches of other views of Xenocrates\nthat might fall under the heading \u2018metaphysics\u2019.\n\nSimplicius, in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Categories\n(Kalbfleisch 1907, 63.21\u201324) tells us that Xenocrates objected\nto Aristotle\u2019s list of ten categories as too long: he thought all that\nwas needed was the distinction, visible in Plato, between things that\nare \u2018by virtue of themselves\u2019 and things that are\n\u2018relative to something\u2019 (see, e.g., Sophist 255c,\nand Dancy 1999). The standard examples help clarify this: the terms\nman and horse are of the first sort, whereas\nlarge, relative to small, good relative to\nbad, etc., are of the latter type.\n\nThere was, it appears from a text also preserved by Simplicius (in his\ncommentary on the Physics, Diels 1882, 247.30\u2013248.20,\nfrom Hermodorus, an early associate of Plato\u2019s), an internal\nconnection between these \u2018old academic categories\u2019 and the\nOne and the Indefinite Dyad. The One was the heading over the category\nof things that are \u2018by virtue of themselves\u2019: such things\nare standalone entities, one thing. The Indefinite Dyad was\nthe heading over the category of relatives: such a term refers to an\nindefinite continuum pointing in two directions. All this is referred\nto Plato, not Xenocrates, but if Xenocrates accepted Plato\u2019s later\ntheory, or at least some of it, he presumably accepted this as well,\nand saw in Aristotle\u2019s proliferation of categories a threat to the\nbasic two principles he shared with Plato.\n\nA text preserved in Arabic (see Pines 1961) has Alexander of\nAphrodisias criticizing Xenocrates for saying that the (less general)\nspecies is prior to the (more general) genus because the latter, being\nan element in the definitions of the former, is a part of them (and\nwholes are subsequent to parts).\n\nA long passage in Themistius\u2019 commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima (Heinze 1899, 11.18\u201312.33) seems to stem from\nXenocrates\u2019 On Nature (in 11.37\u201312.1 Themistius says\n\u201cIt is possible to gather all these {things} from the On\nNature of Xenocrates\u201d). This is a discussion of a story\nabout the composition of the soul from the formal numbers 1, 2, 3, and\n4 (although 1 was not normally considered a number), mentioned in\nDe anima 408b18\u201327. The motivation for this account of\nthe soul, in both Aristotle and Themistius, is the explanation of how\nwe can know things about the universe: the universe is derivative from\nthose numbers, and so, if the soul is similarly derivative, the soul\ncan know things under the principle that like things are known by\nlike. This cognitive sort of account is contrasted with another\nmotivic type of account, that takes as the primary thing to be\nexplained the fact that the soul can initiate motion.\n\nHowever, it is quite clear that, even if the story about the reduction\nof the soul to numbers stems from Xenocrates\u2019 On Nature, the\nnumerical reduction was supposed by Themistius not to be Xenocrates\u2019,\nbut (perhaps) Plato\u2019s. Aristotle and Themistius both give separate\nmention to the account of the soul that is traditionally ascribed to\nXenocrates: that it is a self-moving number (De anima\n408b32\u201333; Themistius in 12.30\u201333; the ascription to\nXenocrates is supported by a large number of texts gathered as frs.\n60H, 165\u2013187IP: e.g., Alexander of Aphrodisias on Aristotle\u2019s\nTopics, Wallies 1891, 162.17). Both Aristotle and Themistius\ncharacterize this account as an attempt to combine the cognitive and\nthe motivic ways of thinking about the soul; as Themistius puts it\n(12.30\u201333):\n\nAnd there were others who wove the two together into the explanation\nof the soul, both moving and knowing, such as the one who asserted the\nsoul {to be} a number that moves itself, pointing by\n\u2018number\u2019 to the capacity for knowing and by \u2018moving\nitself\u2019 to that for moving.\n\n\nThemistius does not here tell us that this is Xenocrates\u2019 account, but\nhe does later on (see esp. 32.19\u201334, which refers expressly to\nXenocrates\u2019 On Nature book 5).\n2. Theory of Knowledge\n\nAs already noted, this heading comes under \u2018logic\u2019 in\nSextus Empiricus. No one reports anything for Xenocrates about what we\nwould think of as pure logic; Sextus (Adversus mathematicos\nvii 147\u2013149) gives us a scrap about epistemology. Xenocrates is\nsupposed to have divided the substances or entities into three groups:\nperceptible, intelligible, and believable (also referred to as\n\u2018composite\u2019 and \u2018mixed\u2019). The intelligible\nones were objects of knowledge, which Xenocrates apparently spoke of\nas \u2018epistemonic logos\u2019 or \u2018knowing account\u2019,\nand were \u2018located\u2019 outside the heavens. The perceptible\nones were objects of perception, which was capable of attaining truth\nabout them but nothing that counted as knowledge; they were within the\nheavens. The composite ones were the heavenly objects themselves, and\nobjects of belief, which is sometimes true and sometimes false.\n\nThis scheme descends from that in Plato, Republic V ad\nfin., where the objects of knowledge were differentiated from\nthose of belief, and from Republic VI ad fin., where\nthat division is portrayed on a divided line. In the latter passage,\nPlato seems actually to have four divisions of types of cognition and\ntheir objects, but this is notoriously difficult (see Burnyeat 1987),\nand Xenocrates appears to have rethought it. His tripartite division\nof objects looks like that in Aristotle, Metaphysics XII\n1.\n\nThe phrase \u2018epistemonic logos\u2019 is one Sextus (145) also\nassigns to Speusippus; it also recalls discussions in Aristotle (e.g.\nMetaphysics VII 15) and the end of Plato\u2019s\nTheaetetus. An \u2018epistemonic logos\u2019 is the sort of\naccount that carries knowledge with it.\n\nThe intelligible domain must have included the formal numbers dealt\nwith above, which was also, as mentioned, the domain of mathematics,\nwhile the special place for the heavens accords with the fact that one\nof the items in D.L.\u2019s bibliography is \u201cOn Astronomy, 6\nbooks\u201d.\n\nThis picture seems to square with Aristotle\u2019s exempting Xenocrates\nfrom the charge, leveled against Speusippus, of producing a\ndiscontinuous universe, and with Theophrastus\u2019 comment to the effect\nthat Xenocrates\u2019 universe encompassed everything.\n\nHere again we encounter Xenocrates the theologian: Sextus tells us\n(149) that Xenocrates associated the three fates with his three groups\nof substances: Atropos with the intelligible ones, Clotho with the\nperceptible ones, and Lachesis with the believable ones. This sounds a\nXenocratean touch: it connects with the interpretation of Plato (see\nRepublic X 620d\u2013e) and takes mythology very\nseriously.\n3. Ethics\n\nHere we are very much in the dark: we have only disconnected snippets\nto consider.\n\nAristotle names Xenocrates in the Topics in connection with\ntwo ethical views: at II 6. 112a37\u201338 he ascribes to him the\nview that a happy man is one with a good soul, along with (perhaps)\nthe claim that one\u2019s soul is one\u2019s daimon, whatever that\nmeans; at VII 1. 152a7\u20139 he ascribes to him an argument to the\neffect that the good life and the happy life are the same, employing\nas premises the claims that the good life and the happy life are both\nthe most choosable (a little later, in 152a26\u201330, Aristotle\nobjects to this argument).\n\nPlutarch claims (De communibus notitiis adversus Stoicos\n1069e\u2013f) that Xenocrates made happiness turn on living in\naccordance with nature; since this may derive from Antiochus of\nAscalon, whose project it was to assimilate the Academy to Stoicism,\nit is suspect. Clement (Stromateis II 22) ascribes to him the\nview that happiness is the possession of one\u2019s own excellence in the\nsoul. This view bears a family resemblance to Aristotle\u2019s (NE\nI 7. 1098a16\u201317, 9. 1099b26). The negative emphasis in\nXenocrates\u2019 evaluation of philosophical activity as \u201cstopping\nthe disturbance of the affairs of life\u201d ([Galen], Historia\nphilosophiae 8, in Diels 1879 605.7\u20138) sounds like a step\nin the direction of the Hellenistic goal of undisturbedness.\n",
