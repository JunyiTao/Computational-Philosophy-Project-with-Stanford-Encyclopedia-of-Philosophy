    "main_text": "Japanese Pure Land Buddhism\u2019s Encounter with Modernity || Christian Critique of Pure Land Buddhism\n5.1 Christian Critique of Pure Land Buddhism\n\nDuring the four decades from the opening of Japan to about the time of\nthe World\u2019s Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893, Buddhist\ninstitutions were forced into a largely defensive posture in the face\nof programs for radical social change and the influx of Christian\nmissionizing. Buddhist reform movements were beginning to arise, but\non the whole it was a period for regrouping, apologetics, and new\norganizational rather than intellectual development. The observations\nand criticisms by Christian missionaries regarding Japanese Buddhism\nduring this period reveal the challenges to which Buddhists sought to\nrespond. An example is a lecture delivered by M. L. Gordon\n(1844\u20131900), a Congregational missionary and teacher, to the\n\u201cGeneral Conference of the Protestant Missionaries of\nJapan\u201d in Osaka in 1883. To more than one hundred missionaries,\nGordon, a scholar of Japanese Buddhism and author of tracts in both\nJapanese and English, discussed \u201cthe religious influence of\nBuddhism as an obstacle to the reception of the Gospel in Japan\u201d\n(Gordon 1883). He notes that in the modernizing Japan of his time,\n\u201cthere are many among the educated classes who not only have no\nsympathy with Buddhism but violently hate it.\u201d Still, he\nbelieved Buddhism remained the primary impediment to missionizing.\nMoreover, he identified Pure Land Buddhism, specifically the Shin\nBuddhism (J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b) in the tradition of Shinran\u2019s\nthought, as \u201cthe most popular and flourishing\u201d of Buddhist\nschools. Gordon\u2019s critique of Japanese Buddhism, and of Shin\nBuddhism in particular, highlights issues that Buddhist thinkers have\ncontinued to grapple with in the modern era up to today: reasoned\nunderstanding in the face of modern knowledge, existential engagement,\nand social action.\n\nGordon\u2019s attack on Pure Land Buddhism begins with the assertion\nthat it \u201cis not the Buddhism which Gotama taught\u201d and,\ngoing even further, that \u201cthe Buddhism taught by the Shin sect\nof Japan is in some respects exactly opposed to the teaching of\nShakya\u201d (Gordon 1882, p. 108). Utilizing contemporaneous\nEuropean scholarship in Sanskrit and Pali, Gordon lists contradictions\nbetween \u201cBuddhism as Gotama taught it\u201d and \u201cthe\nso-called Mahayana\u201d teachings, which \u201care perversions\nrather than denials of the truth, and hence are all the more\ndangerous.\u201d The problem Gordon encounters is partly a rift with\nWestern rationality\u2014what he calls the ability \u201cfor the\nBuddhist mind to look a logical contradiction squarely in the face\nwithout recognizing it.\u201d Even more important to him, however,\nare how the perceived deviations in the Pure Land tradition that have\ntransformed \u201coriginal Buddhism\u201d into a religion in the\nmode of Christianity.\n\nGordon adduces \u201cthe three great biblical doctrines\u201d that\nfor him evince Christianity\u2019s superiority over Japanese\nBuddhism: \u201cGod, Sin, and Salvation.\u201d These touch on the\nphilosophical issues of ontology, anthropology, and ethics that we\nhave considered, and adumbrate the topics Japanese Buddhists would\ntake up and continue to tackle into the twentieth century. Gordon\nbegins by remarking on \u201cthe difficulty of bringing the Buddhist\nto an adequate conception of God.\u201d Here, the concept of God as\ncreator is pivotal for Gordon, in part because it identifies in God a\nunique transcendence not present in the conceptions of Buddhas. As\nJapanese Buddhists pointed out in their first encounters with\nChristianity, the notion of divine incarnation fits easily into a\nbroad Japanese Buddhist paradigm of the emergence of form from\nformless reality. In Gordon\u2019s words, \u201cThe doctrine of the\nIncarnation may be referred to \u2026 as having been greatly\ndegraded by Buddhism. Incarnations are frequent.\u201d Further,\nrelated to emergence or manifestation is the ontological ambiguity of\nnonduality. Hence Gordon finds, perhaps with some frustration, that\n\u201cif we were to ask the priest who preaches this [Pure Land]\ndoctrine \u2026 whether Amida really exists or not, he would perhaps\nafter some squirming admit that either view of the case is perfectly\nadmissible.\u201d\n\nFor Gordon, God as creator serves as the linchpin for the other two\nkey doctrines, sin and salvation. In lacking a conception of creator,\nBuddhism \u201crecognizes no supreme and intelligent Ruler and Judge\nof the universe.\u201d This leads to \u201conly a very inadequate\nidea of sin,\u201d one that trivializes it and in fact promotes\n\u201cimmorality.\u201d A further consequence is that salvation in\nBuddhism is \u201csalvation from the misery of the present world\nrather than salvation from sin.\u201d Pure Land Buddhism, in other\nwords, denigrates the significance of present life and looks only to\nthe promise of deliverance in the future.\n\nChristianity\u2019s challenge to Japanese Buddhists involved what\nGordon expressed as \u201cpower over the hearts and lives of\nmen,\u201d which had not necessarily been sought by the Japanese\ntemple priests whose chief duty was to the calendar of memorial\nceremonies. In his autobiographical account of his ministry, Gordon\nspeaks of his converts\u2019 testimony about the depth of their\nexperiences. He states: \u201cA powerful impression of [sin] as a\npersonal burden is not common. One old lady testified that she had\nhardly thought of herself as a sinner, until she began to hear this\n\u2018new way.\u2019 \u2026 Christianity alone brings true\nrepentance\u201d (Gordon 1893, pp. 213\u2013214).\n\nGordon further states, \u201cChristianity makes loving service to\nmankind more prominent than other religions.\u201d The\nmissionaries\u2019 challenge to articulate both a personal and a\ncorporate, social ethic roused the Buddhists to establish schools,\nhospitals, and various kinds of chaplaincies.\n",
