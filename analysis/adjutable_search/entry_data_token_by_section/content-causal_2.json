Specific Causal Theories of Mental Content\n\nThe unifying inspiration for causal theories of mental content is that\nsome syntactic item \u201cX\u201d means X because \u201cX\u201ds\nare caused by\n Xs.[5]\n Matters cannot be this simple, however, since in general one expects\nthat some causes of \u201cX\u201d are not among the\ncontent-specifying causes of \u201cX\u201ds. There are numerous\nexamples illustrating this point, each illustrating a kind of cause\nthat must not typically be among the content-determining causes of\n\u201cX\u201d:\n\nSuppose there is some syntactic item \u201cX\u201d that is a\nputative mental representation of a dog. Dogs will presumably cause\ntokens of \u201cX\u201d, but so might foxes at odd angles, with some\nobstructions, at a distance, or under poor lighting conditions. The\ncausal theorist will need some principle that allows her to say that\nthe causal links between dogs and \u201cX\u201ds will be\ncontent-determining, where the causal links between, say, foxes and\n\u201cX\u201ds will not. Mice and shrews, mules and donkeys, German\nShepherds and wolves, dogs and paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 dogs, dogs and\nstuffed dogs, and any number of confusable groups would do to make\nthis point.\nA syntactic item \u201cX\u201d with the putative content of dog\nmight also be caused by a dose of LSD, a set of strategically placed\nand activated microelectrodes, a brain tumor, or quantum mechanical\nfluctuations. Who knows what mental representations might be triggered\nby these things? LSD, microelectrodes, etc., should (typically) not be\namong the content-determining causes of most mental\nrepresentations.\nUpon hearing the question \u201cWhat kind of animal is named\n\u2018Fido\u2019?\u201d a person might token the syntactic item\n\u201cX\u201d. One will want at least some cases in which this\n\u201cX\u201d means dog, but to get this result the causal theorist\nwill not want the question to be among the content-determining causes\nof \u201cX\u201d.\nIn seeing a dog, there is a causal pathway between the dog through\nthe visual system (and perhaps beyond) to a token of \u201cX\u201d.\nWhat in this causal pathway from the dog to \u201cX\u201d\nconstitutes the content-determining element? In virtue of what is it\nthe case that \u201cX\u201d means dog, rather than retinal\nprojection of a dog, or any number of other possible points along the\npathway? Clearly there is a similar problem for other sense\nmodalities. In hearing a dog, there is a causal pathway between the\ndog through the auditory system (and perhaps beyond) to a token of\n\u201cX\u201d. What makes \u201cX\u201d mean dog, rather than\nsound of a dog (barking?) or eardrum vibration or motion in the stapes\nbone of the inner ear? One might press essentially the same point by\nasking what makes \u201cX\u201d mean dog, rather than some complex\nfunction of all the diverse causal intermediaries between dogs and\n\u201cX\u201d.\n\n\nThe foregoing problem cases are generally developed under the rubric\nof \u201cfalse beliefs\u201d or \u201cthe disjunction\nproblem\u201d in the following way and can be traced to Fodor (1984).\nNo one is perfect, so a theory of content should be able to explicate\nwhat is going on when a person makes a mistake, such as mistaking a\nfox for a dog. The first thought is that this happens when a fox (at a\ndistance or in poor lighting conditions) causes the occurrence of a\ntoken of \u201cX\u201d and, since \u201cX\u201d means dog, one has\nmistaken a fox for a dog. The problem with this first thought arises\nwith the invocation of the idea that \u201cX\u201d means dog. Why\nsay that \u201cX\u201d means dog, rather than dog or fox? On a\ncausal account, we need some principled reason to say that the content\nof \u201cX\u201d is dog, hence that the token of \u201cX\u201d is\nfalsely tokened by the fox, rather than the content of \u201cX\u201d\nis dog or fox, hence that the token of \u201cX\u201d is truly\ntokened by the fox. What basis is there for saying that\n\u201cX\u201d means dog, rather than dog or fox? Because there\nappears always to be this option of making the content of a term some\ndisjunction of items, the problem has been called \u201cthe\ndisjunction\n problem\u201d.[6]\n\nAs was noted above, what unifies causal theories of mental content is\nsome version of the idea that \u201cX\u201ds being causally\nconnected to Xs makes \u201cX\u201ds mean Xs. What divides causal\ntheories of mental content, most notably, is the different approaches\nthey take to separating the content-determining causes from the\nnon-content-determining causes. Some of these different theories\nappeal to normal conditions, others to functions generated by natural\nselection, others to functions acquired ontogenetically, and still\nothers to dependencies among laws. At present there is no approach\nthat is commonly agreed to correctly separate the content-determining\ncauses from the non-content determining causes while at the same time\nrespecting the need not to invoke existing semantic concepts. Although\neach attempt may have technical problems of its own, the recurring\nproblem is that the attempts to separate content-determining from\nnon-content-determining causes threaten to smuggle in semantic\nelements.\n\nIn this section, we will review the internal problematic of causal\ntheories by examining how each theory fares on our battery of test\ncases (I)\u2013(IV), along with other objections from time to time.\nThis provides a simple, readily understood organization of the project\nof developing a causal theory of mental content, but it does this at a\nprice. The primary literature is not arranged exactly in this way. The\npositive theories found in the primary literature are typically more\nnuanced than what we present here. Moreover, the criticisms are not\narranged into the kind of test battery we have with cases\n(I)\u2013(IV). One paper might bring forward cases (I) and (III)\nagainst theory A, where another paper might bring forward cases (I)\nand (II) against theory B. Nor are the examples in our test battery\nexactly the ones developed in the primary literature. In other words,\nthe price one pays for this simplicity of organization is that we have\nsomething less like a literature review and more like a theoretical\nand conceptual toolbox for understanding causal theories.\n",
