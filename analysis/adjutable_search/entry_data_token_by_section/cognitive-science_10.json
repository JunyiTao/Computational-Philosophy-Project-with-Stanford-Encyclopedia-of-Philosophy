    "main_text": "Theoretical Approaches || Theoretical neuroscience\n4.7 Theoretical neuroscience\n\nTheoretical neuroscience is the attempt to develop mathematical and\ncomputational theories and models of the structures and processes of\nthe brains of humans and other animals. It differs from connectionism\nin trying to be more biologically accurate by modeling the behavior of\nlarge numbers of realistic neurons organized into functionally\nsignificant brain areas. Computational models of the brain have become\nbiologically richer, both with respect to employing more realistic\nneurons such as ones that spike and have chemical pathways, and with\nrespect to simulating the interactions among different areas of the\nbrain such as the hippocampus and the cortex. These models are not\nstrictly an alternative to computational accounts in terms of logic,\nrules, concepts, analogies, images, and connections, but should mesh\nwith them and show how mental functioning can be performed at the\nneural level. The explanatory schema for theoretical neuroscience\nis:\n\nExplanation target:\n\nHow does the brain carry out functions such as cognitive\ntasks?\n Explanatory pattern:\n\nThe brain has neurons organized by synaptic connections into\npopulations and brain areas.\nThe neural populations have spiking patterns that are transformed\nvia sensory inputs and the spiking patterns of other neural\npopulations.\nInteractions of neural populations carry out functions including\ncognitive tasks.\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of theoretical neuroscience, mental\nrepresentations are patterns of neural activity, and inference is\ntransformation of such patterns.
