    "main_text": "\n\r\nLike most other ancient philosophers, Plato maintains a virtue-based\r\neudaemonistic conception of ethics. That is to say, happiness or\r\nwell-being (eudaimonia) is the highest aim of moral thought\r\nand conduct, and the virtues (aret\u00ea:\r\n\u2018excellence\u2019) are the dispositions/skills needed to attain\r\nit. If Plato\u2019s conception of happiness is elusive and his\r\nsupport for a morality of happiness seems somewhat subdued, there are\r\nseveral reasons. First, he nowhere defines the concept of happiness\r\nnor makes it the direct target of investigation but introduces it in\r\nan oblique way in the pursuit of other questions. Second, the\r\ntreatment of the human good varies in the different dialogues, so that\r\nreaders find themselves confronted with the problem of what to make of\r\nthe discrepancies between different works. This touches on a\r\nfundamental problem with Plato\u2019s work \u2013 namely, whether to\r\nfollow a \u2018unitarian\u2019, \u2018revisionist\u2019, or\r\n\u2018developmentalist\u2019 approach to his writings. Whereas\r\nunitarians regard the dialogues as pieces of one mosaic and take the\r\nview that Plato, in essence, maintains a unified doctrine from his\r\nearliest to his latest works, revisionists maintain that Plato\u2019s\r\nthought underwent a fundamental transformation later in his life,\r\nwhile \u2018developmentalists\u2019 hold that Plato\u2019s views\r\nevolved significantly throughout his career. While revisionism has\r\nlost its impact in recent years, developmentalism has gained in\r\ninfluence. Although there is no unanimity, few unitarians nowadays\r\ndeny that the character of Plato\u2019s early, middle, and late works\r\ndiffers in style, language, scope, and content, as is to be expected\r\nin a philosopher who was at work for more than fifty years. Most\r\ndevelopmentalists, in turn, agree that it is impossible to line up\r\nPlato\u2019s works like pearls on a string and to reconstruct his\r\nprogress from dialogue to dialogue; where the views expressed in\r\ndifferent dialogues seem to disagree, there may be complementation or\r\nsupplementation at work, rather than divergence. Given that Plato\r\nnever speaks in his own voice, it is important to take note of who the\r\ninterlocutors are and what role is assigned to Socrates, if he is the\r\nmain speaker. Plato\u2019s dialogues should never be treated in\r\nisolation when it comes to the reconstruction of his doctrine; but\r\neven the comparison and contrasting of ideas presented in different\r\ndialogues is not a safe recipe for interpreting this elusive\r\nthinker\u2019s views (for a more detailed discussion see the entry on\r\n Plato).\n\r\nPlato\u2019s so-called \u2018Socratic\u2019 dialogues share certain\r\ncharacteristics as a group. They are short interrogations by Socrates\r\nof the kind indicated in his explanation of his divine mission in the\r\nApology. They seem designed, inter alia, to undermine\r\nunquestioned traditional views and values rather than to develop\r\npositive accounts. The positive accounts contained in the middle, the\r\nso-called \u2018Platonic\u2019, dialogues \u2013 that are grouped\r\naround the Republic \u2013 treat happiness in different ways\r\nas a state of perfection in a moral as well as in an intellectual\r\nsense. The exact nature of this state of mind is not easy to pinpoint,\r\nhowever, because it is based on metaphysical presuppositions that are,\r\nat least prima facie, both hazy and out of the realm of ordinary\r\nunderstanding. There is not, as there is in Aristotle, an explicit\r\ndetermination of happiness as the actualization of one\u2019s best\r\npotential in a well-organized community. Instead, at least in some\r\ntexts, Plato\u2019s moral ideals appear both austere and\r\nself-abnegating: The soul is to remain aloof from the pleasures of the\r\nbody in the pursuit of higher knowledge, while communal life demands\r\nthe subordination of individual wishes and aims to the common\r\ngood.\n\r\nThe difficulties of assessing Plato\u2019s ethical thought are\r\ncompounded by the fact that the metaphysical underpinnings seem to\r\nchange during his long life. In the Socratic dialogues, there are no\r\nindications that the search for virtue and the human good goes beyond\r\nthe human realm. This changes in the middle dialogues that show a\r\ngrowing interest in an all-encompassing metaphysical grounding of\r\nknowledge, a development that leads to the positing of the\r\n\u2018Forms\u2019 as the determinants of the true nature of all\r\nthings, culminating in the Form of the Good as the transcendent\r\nprinciple of all goodness. Though the theory of the Forms is not\r\nconfined to human values but encompasses the whole of nature, Plato, in\r\nthe middle dialogues, seems to assume no more than an analogy between\r\nhuman affairs and cosmic harmony. The late dialogues, by contrast,\r\ndisplay an increasing tendency to assume a unity of the microcosm of\r\nhuman life and the macrocosmic order of the entire universe, a\r\ntendency that is displayed most fully in the Philebus and the\r\nTimaeus. While these holistic tendencies appeal to the\r\nimagination because they rely on harmonic relations expressed in\r\nmathematical proportions, the metaphysical status of the Forms is even\r\nharder to make out in the late dialogues than in the middle dialogues.\r\nThough Plato\u2019s late works do not show any willingness to lower\r\nthe standards of knowledge as such, Plato indicates that his design of\r\na rational cosmic order is based on conjecture and speculation, an\r\nacknowledgment that finds its counterpart in his more pragmatic\r\ntreatment of ethical standards and political institutions in his last\r\npolitical work, the Laws.\n",
