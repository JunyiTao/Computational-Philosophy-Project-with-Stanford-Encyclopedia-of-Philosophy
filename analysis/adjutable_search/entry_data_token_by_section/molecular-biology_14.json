    "main_text": "Molecular Biology and General Philosophy of Science || Experimentation\n4. Conclusion\n\nAn overview of the history of molecular biology revealed the original\nconvergence of geneticists, physicists, and structural chemists on a\ncommon problem: the nature of inheritance. Conceptual and\nmethodological frameworks from each of these disciplinary strands\nunited in the ultimate determination of the double helical structure\nof DNA (conceived of as an informational molecule) along with the\nmechanisms of gene replication, mutation, and expression. With this\nrecent history in mind, philosophers of molecular biology have\nexamined the key concepts of the field: mechanism, information, and\ngene. Moreover, molecular biology has provided cases for addressing\nmore general issues in the philosophy of science, such as reduction,\nexplanation, extrapolation, and experimentation.\n",
