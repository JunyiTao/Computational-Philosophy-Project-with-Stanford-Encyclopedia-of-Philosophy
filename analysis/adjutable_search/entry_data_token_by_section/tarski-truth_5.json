    "main_text": "Some kinds of truth definition on the 1933 pattern || The standard truth definitions\n2.1 The standard truth definitions\n\nThe two standard truth definitions are at first glance not definitions\nof truth at all, but definitions of a more complicated relation\ninvolving assignments \\(a\\) of objects to variables: \n\\[\na \\text{ satisfies the formula } F\n\\]\n\n\n(where the symbol \u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 is a placeholder for a name of a\nparticular formula of the object language). In fact satisfaction\nreduces to truth in this sense: \\(a\\) satisfies the formula \\(F\\) if\nand only if taking each free variable in \\(F\\) as a name of the object\nassigned to it by \\(a\\) makes the formula \\(F\\) into a true sentence.\nSo it follows that our intuitions about when a sentence is true can\nguide our intuitions about when an assignment satisfies a formula. But\nnone of this can enter into the formal definition of truth, because\n\u2018taking a variable as a name of an object\u2019 is a semantic\nnotion, and Tarski\u2019s truth definition has to be built only on\nnotions from syntax and set theory (together with those in the object\nlanguage); recall Section 1.1. In fact Tarski\u2019s reduction goes\nin the other direction: if the formula \\(F\\) has no free variables,\nthen to say that \\(F\\) is true is to say that every assignment\nsatisfies it.\n\nThe reason why Tarski defines satisfaction directly, and then deduces\na definition of truth, is that satisfaction obeys recursive\nconditions in the following sense: if \\(F\\) is a compound\nformula, then to know which assignments satisfy \\(F\\), it\u2019s\nenough to know which assignments satisfy the immediate constituents of\n\\(F\\). Here are two typical examples:\n\nThe assignment \\(a\\) satisfies the formula \u2018\\(F\\)\nand \\(G\\)\u2019 if and only if \\(a\\) satisfies \\(F\\) and\n\\(a\\) satisfies \\(G\\).\nThe assignment \\(a\\) satisfies the formula \u2018For all\n\\(x\\), \\(G\\)\u2019 if and only if for every individual \\(i\\), if\n\\(b\\) is the assignment that assigns \\(i\\) to the variable \\(x\\) and\nis otherwise exactly like \\(a\\), then \\(b\\) satisfies \\(G\\).\n\n\nWe have to use a different approach for atomic formulas. But for\nthese, at least assuming for simplicity that \\(L\\) has no function\nsymbols, we can use the metalanguage copies \\(\\#(R)\\) of the predicate\nsymbols \\(R\\) of the object language. Thus:\n\nThe assignment \\(a\\) satisfies the formula \\(R(x,y)\\) if and only\nif \\(\\#(R)(a(x),a(y))\\).\n\n\n(Warning: the expression \\(\\#\\) is in the metametalanguage, not in the\nmetalanguage \\(M\\). We may or may not be able to find a formula of\n\\(M\\) that expresses \\(\\#\\) for predicate symbols; it depends on\nexactly what the language \\(L\\) is.)\n\nSubject to the mild reservation in the next paragraph, Tarski\u2019s\ndefinition of satisfaction is compositional, meaning that the\nclass of assignments which satisfy a compound formula \\(F\\) is\ndetermined solely by (1) the syntactic rule used to construct \\(F\\)\nfrom its immediate constituents and (2) the classes of assignments\nthat satisfy these immediate constituents. (This is sometimes phrased\nloosely as: satisfaction is defined recursively. But this formulation\nmisses the central point, that (1) and (2) don\u2019t contain any\nsyntactic information about the immediate constituents.)\nCompositionality explains why Tarski switched from truth to\nsatisfaction. You can\u2019t define whether \u2018For all\n\\(x, G\\)\u2019 is true in terms of whether \\(G\\) is true, because in\ngeneral \\(G\\) has a free variable \\(x\\) and so it isn\u2019t either\ntrue or false.\n\nThe reservation is that Tarski\u2019s definition of satisfaction in\nthe 1933 paper doesn\u2019t in fact mention the class of assignments\nthat satisfy a formula \\(F\\). Instead, as we saw, he defines the\nrelation \u2018\\(a\\) satisfies \\(F\\)\u2019, which determines what\nthat class is. This is probably the main reason why some people\n(including Tarski himself in conversation, as reported by Barbara\nPartee) have preferred not to describe the 1933 definition as\ncompositional. But the class format, which is compositional on any\nreckoning, does appear in an early variant of the truth definition in\nTarski\u2019s paper of 1931 on definable sets of real numbers. Tarski\nhad a good reason for preferring the format \u2018\\(a\\) satisfies\n\\(F\\)\u2019 in his 1933 paper, namely that it allowed him to reduce\nthe set-theoretic requirements of the truth definition. In sections 4\nand 5 of the 1933 paper he spelled out these requirements\ncarefully.\n\nThe name \u2018compositional(ity)\u2019 first appears in papers of\nPutnam in 1960 (published 1975) and Katz and Fodor in 1963 on natural\nlanguage semantics. In talking about compositionality, we have moved\nto thinking of Tarski\u2019s definition as a semantics, i.e. a way of\nassigning \u2018meanings\u2019 to formulas. (Here we take the\nmeaning of a sentence to be its truth value.) Compositionality means\nessentially that the meanings assigned to formulas give at\nleast enough information to determine the truth values of\nsentences containing them. One can ask conversely whether\nTarski\u2019s semantics provides only as much information as we\nneed about each formula, in order to reach the truth values of\nsentences. If the answer is yes, we say that the semantics is\nfully abstract (for truth). One can show fairly easily, for\nany of the standard languages of logic, that Tarski\u2019s definition\nof satisfaction is in fact fully abstract.\n\nAs it stands, Tarski\u2019s definition of satisfaction is not an\nexplicit definition, because satisfaction for one formula is defined\nin terms of satisfaction for other formulas. So to show that it is\nformally correct, we need a way of converting it to an explicit\ndefinition. One way to do this is as follows, using either higher\norder logic or set theory. Suppose we write \\(S\\) for a binary\nrelation between assignments and formulas. We say that \\(S\\) is a\nsatisfaction relation if for every formula \\(G, S\\) meets the\nconditions put for satisfaction of \\(G\\) by Tarski\u2019s definition.\nFor example, if \\(G\\) is \u2018\\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\)\u2019,\n\\(S\\) should satisfy the following condition for every assignment\n\\(a\\): \n\n\\[\nS(a,G) \\text{ if and only if } S(a,G_1) \\text{ and } S(a,G_2).\n\\]\n\n\nWe can define \u2018satisfaction relation\u2019 formally, using the\nrecursive clauses and the conditions for atomic formulas in\nTarski\u2019s recursive definition. Now we prove, by induction on the\ncomplexity of formulas, that there is exactly one satisfaction\nrelation \\(S\\). (There are some technical subtleties, but it can be\ndone.) Finally we define\n\n\\(a\\) satisfies \\(F\\) if and only if: there is a satisfaction relation\n\\(S\\) such that \\(S(a,F)\\). \n\nIt is then a technical exercise to show that this definition of\nsatisfaction is materially adequate. Actually one must first write out\nthe counterpart of Convention \\(T\\) for satisfaction of formulas, but\nI leave this to the reader.\n",
