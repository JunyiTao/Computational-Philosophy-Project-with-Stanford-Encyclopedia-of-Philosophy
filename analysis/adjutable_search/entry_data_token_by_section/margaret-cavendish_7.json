    "main_text": "Free Will and the Orderly Behavior of Bodies\n8. Free Will and the Orderly Behavior of Bodies\n\nLike many of her seventeenth-century contemporaries, Cavendish\nsubscribes to the view that the universe is a plenum of contiguous\nbodies and that there is no empty space. We might wonder how\nindividual bodies would have any freedom or wiggle room to behave as\nthey please if they are so surrounded and tightly packed in. As we\nhave seen, Cavendish holds that bodies sometimes dominate and\nover-power the bodies that surround them, but she thereby\nsuggests that bodies are sometimes not dominated. She writes for\nexample that\n\nNature is full of variety of motions or actions, so are her parts, or\nelse she could not be said to be self-moving, if she were bound to\ncertain actions, and had not liberty to move as she pleases.\n(Cavendish 1668a, 158)\n\n\nNature having a free power to move, may move as she will. (Cavendish\n1664. 214).\n\n\nthe spirits work more easie, at least more freely, when they are not\ntaskt, than when they are like Apprentices or Journey-men; and will be\nmany times more active when they take or have liberty to play, or to\nfollow their own Appetites, than when they work (as I said) by\nconstraint\u2026 (Cavendish 1671, 590)\n\n\nHere we have Cavendish indicating that (in at least some circumstanes)\nthe various parts of nature are able to move as they please or as they\nwill. But we do not yet know what it means for her to say that a body\nmoves as it will. Perhaps Cavendish subscribes to a libertarian view\nof freedom according to which a creature is free when it possesses a\ntwo-way contra-causal ability to do otherwise. On such a view, an\nagent will always act in a certain way at a given moment, but at the\ntime of action it is always possible for the agent to do otherwise. Or\nperhaps Cavendish subscribes to a compatibilist view of freedom\naccording to which creatures do not possess a two-way ability to do\notherwise, but their action is free in the sense that is due to their\nwill alone, and is not encumbered by other causes.\n\nBodies are generally speaking free, Cavendish supposes, but it is not\nyet clear if she holds that the freedom of bodies is of a libertarian\nor a compatibilist variety. She does not use that contemporary\nterminology herself, of course, and so the question is whether or not\nshe cashes out freedom in terms of a contra-causal power by which\nbodies possess the ability to do otherwise than they do \u2013 again,\neven if she does not use that language \u2013 or if she takes freedom\nto be a matter of the wherewithal that a body has to act by the\nmotions that are internal to it and to keep those motions from being\nsquelched or redirected by an obstacle or hindrance. She nowhere\nspeaks in these exact terms either, but she does make some\ncomments that are very revealing.\n\nFor example, she defines voluntary motion as self-motion, and she\ndescribes the freest bodies at those that are able to make their way\nthrough the plenum with agility and without constraint. She\nwrites,\n\nby voluntary actions I understand self-actions; that is, such actions\nwhose principle of motion is within themselves, and doth not proceed\nfrom an exterior Agent\u2026. (Cavendish 1668a, \u201cTo the\nReader\u201d)\n\n\nhad not the Sensitive Parts incumbrances, they would be, in a degree,\nas agil, and as free as the Rational. (Cavendish 1668b, 20)\n\n\nall the motions are so ordered by Natures wisdom, as not any thing in\nNature can be otherwise, unless by a Supernatural Command and Power of\nGod. (Cavendish 1664, 144)\n\n\nWe might want to be more skeptical of this last passage, because\nCavendish is making a claim that makes reference to the nature and\nactivity of a being of which she thinks we have no idea, but the claim\nis still suggestive. Bracketing a miracle, nothing can happen in\nnature in any other way than it happens in fact, she is saying, but\nshe also supposes that bodies are still generally speaking free. They\nare free, she indicates in the other two passages, when their activity\nand behavior is not obstructed or constrained.\n\nThere are numerous passages throughout her corpus in which\nCavendish describes bodies as free, but there are just a few in\nwhich she fleshes out what it is to which freedom and voluntariness\namount. In these, her view is squarely compatibilist. There are also\npassages in which address the issue of free will from a theological\nperspective \u2013 where she considers whether or not an omniscient\nGod would have preordained all things from eternity or whether God\nwould have left the behavior of creatures more open (for example in\nCavendish 1668a, 295\u2013296, \u201cFurther Observations Upon\nExperimental Philosophy\u201d) \u2013 but in these she is careful to\nsuspend judgment. Other passages suggest a compatibilist reading of\nthe free behavior of creatures as well:\n\nBut man, and for all that I know, all other things, are governed by\noutward Objects, they rule, and we obey; for we do not rule and they\nObey, but every thing is led like dogs in a string, by a stronger\npower, but the outward power being invisible, makes us think, we set\nthe rules, and not the outward Causes, so that we are governed by that\nwhich is without us, not that which is within us; for man hath no\npower over himself. (Cavendish 1663, 29)\n\n\nAs for Chance, it is the visible Effects of some hidden\nCause; and Fortune, a sufficient Cause to produce such\nEffects: for, the conjunction of sufficient Causes, doth produce such\nor such Effects; which Effects could not be produced, if any of those\nCauses were wanting. (Cavendish 1668b, 16)\n\n\nIn a plenum of contiguous bodies, a body will sometimes redirect the\nmotions of a second body in way that that body resists, and in such\ncases the behavior of the second body is not free. In other cases the\nbehavior of the second body is amenable to the redirection of motion,\nand in these cases the motions of the second body are\n\u201coccasioned\u201d and \u201cforced\u201d (Cavendish 1664,\n443), yet the body is still moving as it\n pleases.[39]\n In yet other cases still, a body moves by way of motions that (of\ncourse) are internal to it, but without any outside interference or\nobstruction. But in such a case a body has the motions that it has in\nfact, and not any others. Nor will a body ever be the spontaneous\nsource of any new motion; nor does it (ever) acquire any new motion\nfrom other bodies. It has the motions that it has, and it acts\naccordingly. In a plenum of bodies that are always surrounded by\nfurther bodies, no individual body will ever be entirely independent,\nbut Cavendish is surely correct that some bodies are able to surround\nthemselves with a buffer that weakens or neutralizes the impact of\nbodies further out.\n\nOne potential objection to a compatibilist reading of Cavendish on\nfreedom is that there are numerous passages in her corpus in which she\nsays that bodies behave in a manner that is irregular (Boyle 2017). If\nbodies exhibit irregularity and disorder, they would appear to be in\npossession of a faculty of spontaneity, and Cavendish would appear to\nhold that in at least some instances they exercise freedom of the\nlibertarian variety.\n\nHere are some of the passages in which Cavendish speaks of\nirregularities that occur in nature:\n\n\u2026 [S]ome diseases have such sudden alterations, by the sudden\nchanges of motions, that a wise Physician will not, nor cannot venture\nto apply so many several medicines so suddenly as the alteration\nrequires; and shall therefore Physicians be condemned? And not onely\ncondemned for what cannot be helped by reason of the variety of\nirregular motions, but what cannot be helped in Nature? (Cavendish\n1664, 376)\n\n\n\u2026 Nature poysing her Actions by Opposites, there must needs be\nIrregularities, as well as Regularities; which is the cause that\nseldom any Creature is so exact, but there is some Exception.\n(Cavendish 1668b, 84)\n\n\nGOD, Eternally Perfect: Nature, Eternally Imperfect. GOD, Eternally\nInalterable: Nature Eternally Alterable. GOD, without Error: Nature,\nfull of Irregularities. GOD knows exactly, or perfectly, Nature:\nNature doth not perfectly know. (Cavendish 1668b, 241)\n\n\nCavendish certainly speaks of irregularities and disorder, but there\nare also passages in which she steps back and says that what she has\nin mind when she speaks of an irregularity is just an entity or event\nthat appears irregular to us against the background of our\nexpectations and\n conceptions.[40]\n She says for example that\n\nthere cannot be confusion amongst those parts of Nature, but there\nmust be a constant union and harmony betwixt them; for cross and\nopposite actions make no confusion, but onely a variety; and such\nactions which are different, cross and opposite, not moving always\nafter their usual and accustomed way, I name Irregular, for want of a\nbetter expression; but properly there is no such thing as Irregularity\nin Nature\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 538\u2013539)\n\n\n\u2026 Nevertheless, all these motions, whether regular or\nirregular, are natural; for regularity and irregularity hath but a\nrespect to particulars, and to our conceptions, because those motions\nwhich move not after the ordinary, common or usual way or manner, we\ncall Irregular. (Cavendish 1664, 359\u2013360)\n\n\nThere are a couple of different ways to read the passages in which\nCavendish speaks of irregularities in nature. One is to count them up\nand argue that because they outnumber the competing passages \u2013\nand they do \u2013 Cavendish holds that irregularities are real.\nAnother is to argue that she holds that there exist no irregularities\nat all. On this approach, we would emphasize the passages in which she\nsays that we identify something as an irregularity when it\nruns counter to our expectations. Any such passage would be treated as\na kind of meta-text that is instructing us how to read the passages in\nwhich irregularities are introduced. In that case, Cavendish could\nspeak of irregularities in a million passages or even more, but if she\nalso tells us that all that she means by the term\n\u201cirregularity\u201d is something that runs counter to our\nexpectations, then there is no need to count up the passages pro and\ncon. They are all consistent with the view that nature exhibits an\nexceptionless order.\n\nPerhaps another reason for thinking that creatures have libertarian\nfreedom is that there is normativity in nature \u2013 that there are\nthings that are good and things that are bad, and things that\ncreatures ought (or ought not) to do \u2013 but if there is\nnormativity in nature, then there must be a robust (and libertarian\nsense) in which it is possible for creatures to abide by that\nnormativity. But it is difficult to locate normativity in Cavendish\u2019s\nsystem. She holds that the elemental bodies of nature have features\nlike size, figure, motion, thought, and perception, but there is not a\nsingle passage in her corpus in which she includes normative features\nlike goodness and badness. Instead she says things like that\n\u201cNature knows of notthing else but of corporeal figurative\nMotions\u201d (Cavendish 1664, 333). In a piece entitled \u201cNo\nJudge in Nature,\u201d she writes that \u201cNo Intreaty, nor\nPetition can perswade Nature, nor any Bribes can corrupt, or alter the\ncourse of Nature. Justly there can be no complaints made against\nNature, nor to Nature.\u201d (Cavendish 1653b, 5). There is certainly\nroom for Cavendish to develop what we now call a naturalist\nmeta-ethics, according to which normative claims just reduce to\nfactors like the attitudes and preferences of subjects. She supposes\nthat different humans have different preferences and desires, and that\nnon-human creatures have preferences and desires also, and she could\neasily make sense of how different moral codes arise in different\ncommunities and subcommunities. But none of that is to suggest that\nshe allows that there is such a thing as good or bad\nsimpliciter or that she supposes that because there are\nthings we ought to do, there are things that we have the libertarian\nfreedom to do (or not\n do).[41]\n",
