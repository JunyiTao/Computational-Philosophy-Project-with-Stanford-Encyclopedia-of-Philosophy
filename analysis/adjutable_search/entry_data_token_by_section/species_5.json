    "main_text": "The Ontological Status of Species || The New Biological Essentialism\n2.5 The New Biological Essentialism\n\nGriffiths (1999), Okasha (2002), and LaPorte (2004) have suggested a\nform of species essentialism which can be called \u2018relational\nessentialism\u2019. According to relational essentialism, certain\nrelations among organisms, or between organisms and the environment,\nare necessary and sufficient for membership in a species. Such\nrelations, argue Griffiths, Okasha, and LaPorte, are species essences.\nFor example, they suggest that being descendent from a particular\nancestor is necessary and sufficient for being a member of a\nspecies.\n\nDevitt (2008) rejects relational essentialism. He argues that\nrelational essentialism fails to answer two crucial questions. The\ntaxon question: Why is organism O a member of species\nS? The trait question: Why do members of species S\ntypically have trait T? Devitt suggests that to answer these\nquestions species need intrinsic essences; and because relational\nessentialism only posits relational essences, relational essentialism\nfails to answer these questions. Devitt\u2019s target is not merely\nto discredit relational essentialism, but also to argue for a new form\nof intrinsic biological essentialism. According to Devitt (2008), a\nspecies\u2019 essence is the cluster of intrinsic properties and\nperhaps the relations that cause the typical traits of a taxon\u2019s\nmembers. Let us consider Devitt\u2019s critique of relational\nessentialism. In doing so, we will learn about both relational\nessentialism and Devitt\u2019s intrinsic biological essentialism.\n\nRecall the trait question: Why do zebras have stripes? Devitt (2008,\n352ff.) argues that explanations that merely cite relations are\ninsufficient to explain the traits typically found among zebras. We\nmust cite intrinsic properties as well, and such properties are\nessential intrinsic properties of zebras. Devitt is right that we need\nto cite more than relations to explain why zebras have stripes.\nGenerally, to explain the occurrence of a homologue, such as stripes\nin zebras, we need to cite both relations among organisms and\nintrinsic factors within organisms. More precisely, embryonic zebras\nhave developmental mechanisms that cause zebras to have stripes. These\nmechanisms are intrinsic features of embryonic zebras. But those\ndevelopmental mechanisms must be passed down from parent to offspring,\nvia genealogical relations. So a robust explanation of why zebras have\nstripes cites both the relations and intrinsic properties that cause\nstripes.\n\nGiven the observation that we should cite both genealogy and\ndevelopmental mechanisms to understand why zebras have stripes, should\nwe infer, as Devitt does, that the taxon Zebra has an intrinsic\nessence? Some argue \u2018no\u2019 (Ereshefsky 2010a). Biologists\nexplain the characters of organisms by citing other characters,\nwithout the added metaphysical claim that a character cited in an\nexplanans is essential for membership in a taxon. Consider how a\nbiologist explains the occurrence of stripes in a zebra. In its\nembryonic state, a zebra has an ontogenetic mechanism that causes it\nto develop stripes. That developmental mechanism is neither necessary\nnor sufficient for membership in Zebra. Some zebras lack that\nmechanism. Moreover, the developmental mechanism that causes stripes\nin zebras causes stripes in a variety of mammals, including cats.\nGenerally, the intrinsic properties that cause organismic traits do\nnot coincide with taxonomic boundaries: they cross-cut such\nboundaries. The belief that such intrinsic properties are essential\nfor taxon membership is not part of biological theory.\n\nLet\u2019s turn to the taxon question: Why are certain organisms\nmembers of species S? Relational essentialists argue that\nmodern species concepts posit relational properties, such as\ninterbreeding, genealogy, and occupying a specific niche, as the\ndefining features of species. Relational essentialists tell us that\nbiologists do not posit intrinsic properties as the defining features\nof species. Devitt responds (2008) that citing the relations among the\norganisms of a species does not explain why particular organisms are\nmembers of a certain species. According to Devitt, saying that\norganism O can interbreed with other Homo sapiens\nleaves unanswered why those other organisms are Homo sapiens.\nThen there\u2019s an unanswered regress: why are any of them Homo\nsapiens? According to Devitt, to answer that question we must\ncite essential intrinsic properties in organisms.\n\nHas Devitt made the case for intrinsic essentialism? Perhaps not. Once\nagain, why are certain organisms members of species S?\nAccording to our best biological theory, if S is an\ninterbreeding species, then those organisms have intrinsic\nreproductive mechanisms that allow them to interbreed with one\nanother. However, we do not know which intrinsic mechanisms are\nmechanisms that cause an organism to be a member of a particular\nspecies. We need some way of determining which mechanisms cause an\norganism to be a member of one species versus a member of another\nspecies. Here we must turn to relations: particular population and\ngenealogical relations among organisms. The answer to why particular\nreproductive mechanisms are mechanisms of species S is that\nthose mechanisms occur in organisms whose populations are\ngenealogically connected in a single lineage. Relations are\nexplanatorily prior in explaining taxon identity, not intrinsic\nproperties.\n\nTo reinforce this point, consider which aspects of an organism can be\nchanged while it remains a member of the same species, and which\naspects cannot be changed. The intrinsic reproductive mechanisms\nwithin the organisms of a species can be changed, but being part of\nthe same lineage or gene pool cannot be changed. To make this more\nconcrete consider the case of ring species. A ring species consists of\na geographic ring of populations such that organisms in contiguous\npopulations can successfully mate, but organisms in populations at\ndistant links in the ring cannot successfully mate. The organisms in\ndistant populations of a ring species have different reproductive\nmechanisms (Mayr 1963, 512ff.). Suppose Joe is a member of a ring\nspecies. Joe could have had a different intrinsic reproductive\nmechanism than the one he has. Imagine counterfactually that he is a\nmember of a different population of his ring species, namely one with\ndifferent reproductive mechanisms than those found in his actual\npopulation. In this counterfactual situation Joe is still a member of\nhis species so long as we do not remove him from the lineage and gene\npool of that ring species. Generally, an organism in a species can\nhave a different reproductive mechanism and still be a part of that\nspecies. But an organism cannot be removed from its original lineage\nand put in another lineage and remain part of the original species.\nWhen it comes to species membership, intrinsic mechanisms within the\norganisms of a species can vary, but certain relations among its\norganisms cannot vary (Ereshefsky 2010a). (For more critiques of\nDevitt\u2019s intrinsic essentialism see Barker 2010 and Lewens 2012.\nFor Devitt\u2019s response to those criticisms see Devitt 2021.)\n\nDo the results of this section thus far imply that relational\nessentialism is correct? Consider two traditional requirements of\nessentialism highlighted by Okasha (2002). The membership requirement:\nthe essence of a kind provides the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor membership in that kind. The explanatory requirement: citing a\nkind\u2019s essence is central in explaining the properties typically\nassociated with the members of that kind. Given these two requirements\nOkasha offers the following argument. Because certain relations are\nnecessary and sufficient for membership in a species, such relations\nsatisfy the membership requirement of essentialism. However, those\nrelations do not satisfy the explanatory requirement. According to\nOkasha, relations such as genealogy and interbreeding fail to explain\nthe traits typically found among the members of a species. Instead, we\nmust cite the \u201cgenotype and its developmental environment\u201d\n(2002, 204) to explain such traits. Despite failing to meet the\nexplanatory requirement, Okasha thinks that certain relations are\ntaxon essences. Okasha writes that there is no a priori\nreason to retain the explanatory requirement of essentialism and\nsuggests that it should be dropped. With the explanatory requirement\nout of the way and the membership requirement satisfied, Okasha\nconcludes that species have relational essences.\n\nA potential problem with Okasha\u2019s relational essentialism is\nthat if the relations that serve as the identity conditions for a\nspecies are not central in explaining the typical traits among a\nspecies\u2019 members, then such relations are not essences. Okasha\njettisons a core feature of essentialism: that the essence of a kind\nplays a central role in explaining the typical features of a\nkind\u2019s members. Essentialists, from Aristotle to Locke, from\nKripke to Devitt, believe that essences figure centrally in explaining\nthe traits typically found among the members of a kind. If we give up\nthat explanatory component of essentialism we give up a core feature\nof essentialism, a feature that distinguishes real essences from\nnominal essences. Nominal essences demarcate membership in a kind, but\nthey do not explain the typical traits of a kind. Arguably, any\napproach to natural kinds that aims to capture the kinds of science\nshould preserve this explanatory feature of kinds. So in the end,\nrelational essentialism may not be essentialism because it fails to\nsatisfy a core aim of essentialism.
