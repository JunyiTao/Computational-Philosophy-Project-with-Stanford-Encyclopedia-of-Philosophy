    "main_text": "Analogical arguments || Examples\n2.1 Examples\n\nAnalogical arguments vary greatly in subject matter, strength and\nlogical structure. In order to appreciate this variety, it is helpful\nto increase our stock of examples. First, a geometric example:\n\nExample 7\n (Rectangles and boxes). Suppose that you have established that of all\nrectangles with a fixed perimeter, the square has maximum area. By\nanalogy, you conjecture that of all boxes with a fixed surface area,\nthe cube has maximum volume.\n\nTwo examples from the history of science:\n\nExample 8\n (Morphine and meperidine). In 1934, the pharmacologist Schaumann was\ntesting synthetic compounds for their anti-spasmodic effect. These\ndrugs had a chemical structure similar to morphine. He observed that\none of the compounds\u2014meperidine, also known as\nDemerol\u2014had a physical effect on mice that was\npreviously observed only with morphine: it induced an S-shaped tail\ncurvature. By analogy, he conjectured that the drug might also share\nmorphine\u2019s narcotic effects. Testing on rats, rabbits, dogs and\neventually humans showed that meperidine, like morphine, was an\neffective pain-killer (Lembeck 1989: 11; Reynolds and Randall 1975:\n273).\n\nExample 9\n (Priestley on electrostatic force). In 1769, Priestley suggested that\nthe absence of electrical influence inside a hollow charged spherical\nshell was evidence that charges attract and repel with an inverse\nsquare force. He supported his hypothesis by appealing to the\nanalogous situation of zero gravitational force inside a hollow shell\nof uniform density.\n\nFinally, an example from legal reasoning:\n\nExample 10\n (Duty of reasonable care). In a much-cited case (Donoghue v.\nStevenson 1932 AC 562), the United Kingdom House of Lords found\nthe manufacturer of a bottle of ginger beer liable for damages to a\nconsumer who became ill as a result of a dead snail in the bottle. The\ncourt argued that the manufacturer had a duty to take\n\u201creasonable care\u201d in creating a product that could\nforeseeably result in harm to the consumer in the absence of such\ncare, and where the consumer had no possibility of intermediate\nexamination. The principle articulated in this famous case was\nextended, by analogy, to allow recovery for harm against an\nengineering firm whose negligent repair work caused the collapse of a\nlift (Haseldine v. CA Daw & Son Ltd. 1941 2 KB 343). By\ncontrast, the principle was not applicable to a case where a workman\nwas injured by a defective crane, since the workman had opportunity to\nexamine the crane and was even aware of the defects (Farr v.\nButters Brothers & Co. 1932 2 KB 606).\n",
