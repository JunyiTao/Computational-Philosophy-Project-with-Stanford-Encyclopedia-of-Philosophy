P\u0101r\u012bkh, who brought\nthe Tattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha to light, in their 1940 edition\n(p. iv-xi) of the treatise, assign the work to 8th century (p. x).\nThis dating was slightly modified by Sukhl\u0101lj\u012b\nSa\u1e41ghav\u012b (1941) who placed Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s\nTattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha between 725\u2013825, which, in turn, is\naccepted by Eli Franco (1987: 12\u201313). However, the latter, in\nthe \u2018Preface to the second edition\u2019 of 1994, modifies the\ndate of Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da and assigns him to the\nperiod of 770\u2013830 on the basis of what he thinks are\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s indirect references (primarily terminological\ngrounds) to the Buddhist philosopher Dharmottara (ca.\n740\u2013800).\n\nIn fact, that dating of the Tattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha could be\nslightly modified to perhaps 800\u2013840. I would place\nJayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da after the Digambara Jaina\nphilosopher Akala\u1e45ka Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (c. 720\u2013780) and\nbefore Vidy\u0101nanda P\u0101trakesarisv\u0101min (c. 850), a\nphilosopher in the same tradition who commented on Akala\u1e45ka. As\nFranco (1994: XI) himself notices, the Buddhist Kamala\u015b\u012bla\n(c. 740\u2013795) nowhere refers to Jayar\u0101\u015bi in his\nencyclopedic commentary of the Tattva-sa\u1e45graha. Further, we\nfind no mention of Jayar\u0101\u015bi in the oeuvre of Akala\u1e45ka\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da, although he was very well acquainted with current\nideas of his contemporaries. It would be especially surprising in the\ncase of Akala\u1e45ka Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da not to mention an author who\ngreatly influenced the way Jaina thinkers argued and formulated their\nthoughts, because both of them seem to belong to South India. On a few\noccasions Akala\u1e45ka did have a chance to either allude or even\ndirectly refer to such an original thinker as Jayar\u0101\u015bi\ncertainly was, but he nowhere does it. A good instance is\nAkala\u1e45ka\u2019s work A\u1e63\u1e6da-\u015bat\u012b \u2018In Eight\nHundred Lines\u2019 (itself a commentary on the work\n\u0100pta-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101, \u2018An Examination of An\nAuthoritative Person\u2019) of Samantabhadra, c. 580\u2013640). In\nit, (the commentary on verse 1.3 of\n\u0100pta-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101, A\u1e63\u015ap.2 = A\u1e63S\n29.20), Akala\u1e45ka refers to a materialist argument: \u2018[The\nopponent]: \u201cFor this reason it has been said that there is no\nomniscient person, because truth claims [of various teachers competing\nfor primacy] turn out to be wrong cognitive criteria, inasmuch as\nthere is no difference between them (i.e., all are equal in their\nconvincing force). Since one accepts that [it is not possible to\ndecide for or against a view among a few competing ones], there is\nnothing wrong [in rejecting the idea of an omniscient person].\u201d\n[Akala\u1e45ka:] Ergo this decision of some [thinkers, i.e.,\nmaterialists] is itself void of any rational basis. For, as we know,\nthe scope of perception [which could prove the materialist\u2019s rejection\nof an omniscient person] cannot itself demonstrate that there cannot\nbe any other proof of an omniscient person, because this would have\ntoo far-reaching consequences. Neither can [the materialist prove that\nan omniscient person cannot exist] with the help of inference\n\u00a0(anum\u0101na), because it has no validity [for him]\u2019.\nAkala\u1e45ka clearly has in mind a typical materialist philosopher\nwho rejects the idea of omniscience, but at the same time accepts\nperception (pratyak\u1e63a) as the only valid instrument of\nknowledge, while rejecting the validity of inference (anum\u0101na).\nThat is a standard account of a materialist (C\u0101rv\u0101ka /\nLok\u0101yata) thinker in India and there is really nothing to suggest\nthat what Akala\u1e45ka had here in mind as the target of his\ncriticism was a \u2018qualified sceptic\u2019 (like\nJayar\u0101\u015bi) who rejected the ultimate validity also of\nperception.\n\nHowever, the account changes in what Vidy\u0101nanda (c. 850) has to\nsay on Akala\u1e45ka\u2019s passage. Vidy\u0101nanda is, to our knowledge,\nthe first Indian philosopher to know of and to directly refer to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi. In his A\u1e63\u1e6da-sahasr\u012b \u2018In\nEight Thousand Lines\u2019, Vidy\u0101nanda (A\u1e63S 29.20\u201336.6)\ntakes the passage \u2018\u201cSince one accepts that [it is not\npossible to decide for or against a view among a few competing ones],\nthere is nothing wrong [in rejecting the idea of an omniscient\nperson].\u201d [Akala\u1e45ka:] Ergo this decision of some\n[thinkers, i.e., materialists] is itself void of any rational\nbasis\u2019 (tath\u00ea\u1e63\u1e6datv\u0101d ado\u1e63a ity\neke\u1e63\u0101m\napr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ikaiv\u00ea\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25) as\nexplicitly implying two kinds of approaches to the same question.\nFirst (A\u1e63S 29.20 ff.), he says some nihilistic thinkers (eke)\nare the Lauk\u0101yatika (the followers of Lok\u0101yata, the\nmaterialist school), who do not admit any instrument of knowledge\nwhich would could go beyond the perceptible world, i.e., they accept\nperception as the only cognitive criterion. Second, Vidy\u0101nanda\nsays (A\u1e63S 31.2 ff.), there are also \u2018those who propound\nthe dissolution of [all] categories\u2019\n(tattv\u00f4paplava-v\u0101din), a term which could hardly be more\nunivocal in its clearly referring to Jayar\u0101\u015bi. Had\nAkala\u1e45ka known of Jayar\u0101\u015bi, his \u2018qualified\nscepticism\u2019 and rejection of the validity of perception also, he\nwould have included him among those who rejected the idea of an\nomniscient being.\n\nThat Jayar\u0101\u015bi postdates Akala\u1e45ka is evident also from\nthe fact that, in his Ascertainment of Perfection\n(Siddhi-vini\u015bcaya), Akala\u1e45ka refers to\n\u2018heretics\u2019 (n\u0101stika) and to the materialist\ntradition, which maintains that the world is composed of the four\nelements, but at the same time accepts only one valid cognitive\nprocedure (pram\u0101\u1e47a), namely perception (pratyak\u1e63a),\nnot even inference (anum\u0101na), and therefore cannot demonstrate\nsuch element-based structure of the universe, or alternatively\nentertains a possibility that there are no valid cognitive procedures\nat all (pram\u0101\u1e47\u00e2bh\u0101va) or finds problems with\ndefining what perception is\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a-lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u00e2nupapatti; SVi 4.12, p.\n272.3\u20135). These are clearly the forerunners of the ideas\nelaborated by Jayar\u0101\u015bi, however at the time of\nAkala\u1e45ka they are still in an undeveloped form, and clearly the\nJaina philosopher does not refer to Jayar\u0101\u015bi. However, his\ncommentator Anantav\u012brya (SVi\u1e6c, p. 277.6\u2013278.22)\nimmediately recognizes in these nascent ideas the elaborated system of\nJayar\u0101\u015bi, retroactively projecting them onto\nAkala\u1e45ka\u2019s passage, and refers to Jayar\u0101\u015bi and\nhis treatise by name.\n",
