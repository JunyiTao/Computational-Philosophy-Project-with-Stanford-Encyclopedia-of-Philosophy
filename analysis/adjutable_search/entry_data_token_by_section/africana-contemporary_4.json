    "main_text": "History in contemporary perspective: guiding principles\n3. History in contemporary perspective: guiding principles\n\nIntellectual and institutional histories are unusually central to\nAfricana philosophy, and are intertwined to an unusual degree, but\nthis is not the place to explore the institutional histories in\ndetail. The next section will provide a contemporary intellectual\nhistory, in order to establish the structural elements and thematic\npreoccupations that organize a great deal of the contemporary work\nwe\u2019ll soon consider. Still, it is important to organize the\ndiscussion in a way that makes room for responsible institutional\nhistories and accommodates their insights.\n\nAccordingly, three principles will guide the discussion to come.\nFirst, this study will focus on Africana philosophy as a\nfield. This means that the contributions of individual\nthinkers, however provocative or insightful, will be relevant here\nlargely insofar as they bear on the networks of intellectual exchange\nand institutional credentialing that invite description with terms\nlike \u201cdiscipline\u201d and \u201ctradition.\u201d It also\nmeans observing a distinction between the history of Africana\nphilosophy as an enterprise and the history of African-descended\nphilosophers as a cohort. Many members of this cohort have of course\nmade valuable, germinal contributions to the field, beginning with\ntowering figures like Alexander Crummell, whose establishment of the\nAmerican Negro Academy was an early exercise in building these\nnetworks. But many others, as Stephen C. Ferguson II points out,\n\u201cneed not (and have not) exclusively engaged the Africana\nexperience as an area of inquiry\u201d (Ferguson 2009, 23). The\nformer will be part of the story told here; the latter will not.\n\nSecond, this study will focus, to some degree, on\nprofessional academic work. Philosophical activity outside of\nthe academy\u2014in other institutional spaces or prior to the\nemergence of contemporary universities and their professional\nscholars\u2014will not be peremptorily excluded here, but will be\nrelevant insofar as it bears on the work that happens or might happen\nin or near the academy. The academy is of course not the only site for\nresponsible attempts at knowledge production, but it is a mechanism\nfor systematically enshrining certain of these attempts as resources\nfor more work. That is the aspect of Africana philosophy that I mean\nto take up here.\n\nThird, the discussion will approach the field as a\nparadisciplinary formation, which is to say that it will\nfocus on work that happens or might happen in and near philosophy\ndepartments. In speaking here of proximity to philosophy departments,\nI mean principally to capture two overlapping categories of thinkers:\nscholars who take up recognizably philosophical themes or resources\nin, say, departments of English or political science; and historical\nfigures without the sort of departmental affiliation that registers\nfor scholars now, but who make the kinds of moves and noises that\nencourage philosophers to invite them into their narratives of the\nfield. Which is to say: if philosophy of social science can have\nClifford Geertz and philosophy writ large can have Hume, Kierkegaard,\nEmerson, and Jane Addams, then Africana philosophy can have Patricia\nHill Collins and Alexander Crummell (both of whom will return\nbelow).\n\nIt is important to remain in the orbit of the academic discipline of\nphilosophy for at least three reasons: to preserve space for\nreflection on the distinctly philosophical questions that Africanaity\nputs in play, to cultivate distinctly philosophical resources for\ntreating those questions, and to credit the contributions and career\ntrajectories of the few African-descended philosophers who did their\nwork before the field established itself as a going concern. At the\nsame time, though, focusing just on work by card-carrying philosophers\nwould be unduly restrictive. For one thing, the discipline and the\nprofession have long been hostile both to sustained reflection on the\nissues that define the field and, in quite concrete ways, to the\nhumans who attempted to undertake this reflection. As a result, much\nof this reflection has happened and continues to happen in other\nplaces\u2014in political theory, sociology, literary theory, artistic\npractice, and more. In addition, and as a related matter, Africana\nphilosophy has in practice long been remarkably ecumenical, as the\ncontributor lists for key reference works makes clear. Excluding the\npolitical theorists, sociologists, Black studies scholars, and others\nwho have worked, often in conversation with professional philosophers,\nto advance the field would not only needlessly limit the available\nresources but would also run counter to ongoing practice.\n\nWith these guiding principles in place, and in deference to the\nframing conditions of historicity, coloniality, and heterodoxy, the\nnext section will present a swift history of Africana philosophy.\nConstructing historical narratives is always, to some degree, a\npresentist exercise: it is an attempt to read the past while guided by\ncontemporary concerns and informed by contemporary resources. This\nreading will lean into that aspect of the exercise\u2014it is, in\neffect, a reading of the history as seen in contemporary perspective,\nand is therefore also a way of wading a bit further into the\ncontemporary preoccupations that are the subject of this entry.\n\nThis presentist orientation recommends sorting the history into two\nbroad stages. The first is a long pre-history of the\nparadisciplinary formation under scrutiny here, a period, prior to the\nestablishment of the field in hegemonic epistemic communities, during\nwhich many key themes, issues, texts, and figures emerged. The second\nis a shorter, more recent stage, itself composed of three shorter\nperiods, during which the field established itself, achieved\nconsolidation, and moved into the contemporary moment.\n",
