    "main_text": "The Hybrid Evaluative-Feeling Tradition in Recent Philosophy || Emotions as Patterns of Salience\n7.3 Emotions as Patterns of Salience \n\nAnother influential approach in recent philosophy of emotions takes\nthem to be \n\n\nmechanisms that control the crucial factor of salience among what\nwould otherwise be an unmanageable plethora of objects of attention,\ninterpretations, and strategies of inference and conduct. (de Sousa\n1987: xv; see also Elgin 2006; Evans 2001; Ben-Ze\u2019ev 2000) \n\n\nFor example, there are innumerable things I could in principle be\nfocusing on as I find myself face to face with a grizzly bear on a\nhike, but my fear focuses my attention squarely on the bear, on how\nto interpret its movements, and on how to infer and execute an escape\nstrategy. This approach may be taken to have a \u201cperceptual\nflavor\u201d (Prinz 2004: 223) because it describes emotions as\nmechanisms for changing salience, and perceptions can certainly affect\nsalience. But de Sousa aims to draw attention to the broader role\nemotions play in providing the framework for cognitions of both\nperceptual varieties (e.g., what we see and hear) and non-perceptual\nvarieties (e.g., what we believe and remember). \n\nSome philosophers suggest that the directive power that emotions exert\nover cognitions is partly a function of their essentially dramatic or\nnarrative structure (Rorty 1987 [1988]). Goldie (2012) offers a\nparticularly subtle examination of the role of narrative in\nconstituting our emotions over the long term. It seems conceptually\nincoherent to suppose that one could have an emotion\u2014say, an\nintense jealousy or a consuming rage\u2014for only a fraction of a\nsecond (Wollheim 1999). One explanation of this feature of emotions is\nthat a story plays itself out during the course of each emotional\nepisode, and stories take place over stretches of time. Interestingly,\nGoldie argues that the narrative structure of emotions is the same\nwhether emotions are experienced towards real or fictional objects,\nwhich explains why we can respond to fictional characters with\nfull-fledged, although motivationally muted, emotional responses (for\na review of other solutions to the so-called paradox of\nfiction, see Cova & Friend forthcoming).\n\nDe Sousa (1987) has suggested that the stories characteristic of\ndifferent emotions are learned by association with \u201cparadigm\nscenarios\u201d. Paradigm scenarios involve two aspects: first, a\nsituation type providing the characteristic objects of the specific\nemotion-type (where objects can be particular and formal), and second,\na set of characteristic or \u201cnormal\u201d responses to the\nsituation, where normality is determined by a complex and\ncontroversial mix of biological and cultural factors. These scenarios\nare drawn first from our daily life as small children and later\nreinforced by the stories, art, and culture to which we are exposed.\nLater still, they are supplemented and refined by literature and other\nart forms capable of expanding the range of one\u2019s imagination of\nways to live (de Sousa 1990; Faucher and Tappolet 2008b).\n\nOnce our emotional repertoire is established, we interpret new\nsituations through the lens of different paradigm scenarios. When a\nparticular scenario suggests itself as an interpretation, it arranges\nor rearranges our perceptual, cognitive, and inferential dispositions.\nWhen a paradigm scenario is evoked by a novel situation, the resulting\nemotion may or may not be appropriate to the situation that triggers\nit. Thus, a childhood fear of clowns may be reappraised and overcome\nin adult life as a result of a more realistic appraisal. In that sense\nat least, emotions can be assessed for rationality (see\n section 10\n for further discussion).\n",
