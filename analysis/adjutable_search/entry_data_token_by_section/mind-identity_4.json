    "main_text": "Functionalism and Identity Theory\n5. Functionalism and Identity Theory\n\n\nIt has commonly been thought that the identity theory has been\nsuperseded by a theory called \u2018functionalism\u2019. It could be\nargued that functionalists greatly exaggerate their difference from\nidentity theorists. Indeed some philosophers, such as Lewis (1972 and\n1994) and Jackson, Pargetter and Prior (1982), have seen functionalism\nas a route towards an identity theory. \n\n\nLike Lewis and Armstrong, functionalists define mental states and\nprocesses in terms of their causal relations to behaviour but stop\nshort of identifying them with their neural realisations. Of course the\nterm \u2018functionalism\u2019 has been used vaguely and in different\nways, and it could be argued that even the theories of Place, Smart and\nArmstrong were at bottom functionalist. The word\n\u2018functionalist\u2019 has affinities with that of\n\u2018function\u2019 in mathematics and also with that of\n\u2018function\u2019 in biology. In mathematics a function is a set\nof ordered n-tuples. Similarly if mental processes are defined directly\nor indirectly by sets of stimulus-response pairs the definitions could\nbe seen as \u2018functional\u2019 in the mathematical sense. However\nthere is probably a closer connection with the term as it is used in\nbiology, as one might define \u2018eye\u2019 by its function even\nthough a fly's eye and a dog's eye are anatomically and physiologically\nvery different. Functionalism identifies mental states and processes by\nmeans of their causal roles, and as noted above in connection with\nLewis, we know that the functional roles are possessed by neural states\nand processes. (There are teleological and homuncular forms of\nfunctionalism, which I do not consider here.) Nevertheless an\ninteractionist dualist such as the eminent neurophysiologist Sir John\nEccles would (implausibly for most of us) deny that all functional\nroles are so possessed. One might think of folk psychology, and indeed\nmuch of cognitive science too, as analogous to a \u2018block\ndiagram\u2019 in electronics. A box in the diagram might be labelled\n(say) \u2018intermediate frequency amplifier\u2019 while remaining)\nneutral as to the exact circuit and whether the amplification is\ncarried out by a thermionic valve or by a transistor. Using terminology\nof F. Jackson and P. Pettit (1988, pp. 381\u2013400) the \u2018role\nstate\u2019 would be given by \u2018amplifier\u2019, the\n\u2018realiser state\u2019 would be given by \u2018thermionic\nvalve\u2019, say. So we can think of functionalism as a \u2018black\nbox\u2019 theory. This line of thought will be pursued in the next\nsection.\n\n\nThinking very much in causal terms about beliefs and desires fits in\nvery well not only with folk psychology but also with Humean ideas\nabout the motives of action. Though this point of view has been\ncriticised by some philosophers it does seem to be right, as can be\nseen if we consider a possible robot aeroplane designed to find its way\nfrom Melbourne to Sydney. The designer would have to include an\nelectronic version of something like a map of south-eastern Australia.\nThis would provide the \u2018belief\u2019 side. One would also have\nto program in an electronic equivalent of \u2018go to Sydney\u2019.\nThis program would provide the \u2018desire\u2019 side. If wind and\nweather pushed the aeroplane off course then negative feedback would\npush the aeroplane back on to the right course for Sydney. The\nexistence of purposive mechanisms has at last (I hope) shown to\nphilosophers that there is nothing mysterious about teleology. Nor are\nthere any great semantic problems over intentionality (with a\n\u2018t\u2019). Consider the sentence \u2018Joe desires a\nunicorn\u2019. This is not like \u2018Joe kicks a football\u2019.\nFor Joe to kick a football there must be a football to be kicked, but\nthere are no unicorns. However we can say \u2018Joe desires-true of\nhimself \"possesses a unicorn\" \u2019. Or more generally \u2018Joe\nbelieves-true S\u2019 or \u2018Joe desires-true S\u2019 where S is\nan appropriate sentence (Quine 1960, pp. 206\u201316). Of course if one does\nnot want to relativise to a language one needs to insert \u2018or some\nsamesayer of S\u2019 or use the word \u2018proposition\u2019, and\nthis involves the notion of proposition or intertranslatability. Even\nif one does not accept Quine's notion of indeterminacy of translation,\nthere is still fuzziness in the notions of \u2018belief\u2019 and\n\u2018desire\u2019 arising from the fuzziness of\n\u2018analyticity\u2019 and \u2018synonymy\u2019. The identity\ntheorist could say that on any occasion this fuzziness is matched by\nthe fuzziness of the brain state that constitutes the belief or desire.\nJust how many interconnections are involved in a belief or desire? On a\nholistic account such as Lewis's one need not suppose that\nindividuation of beliefs and desires is precise, even though good\nenough for folk psychology and Humean metaethics. Thus the way in which\nthe brain represents the world might not be like a language. The\nrepresentation might be like a map. A map relates every feature on it\nto every other feature. Nevertheless maps contain a finite amount of\ninformation. They have not infinitely many parts, still less continuum\nmany. We can think of beliefs as expressing the different bits of\ninformation that could be extracted from the map. Thinking in this way\nbeliefs would correspond near enough to the individualist beliefs\ncharacteristic of folk and Humean psychology.\n",
