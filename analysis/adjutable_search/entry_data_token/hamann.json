Life\n\nJohann Georg Hamann was born in K\u00f6nigsberg in 1730, the son of a\nmidwife and a barber-surgeon. He began study in philosophy and\ntheology at the age of 16, changed to law but mainly read literature,\nphilology, and rhetoric, but also mathematics and science. He left\nuniversity without completing his studies and became the governor to a\nwealthy family on a Baltic estate. During this time he continued his\nextraordinarily broad reading and private research. He took up a job\nin the family firm of a friend from his K\u00f6nigsberg days,\nChristoph Berens, and was sent on an obscure mission to London, in\nwhich he evidently failed. He then led a high life until he ran out of\nfriends, money and support. In a garret, depressed and impoverished,\nhe read the Bible cover to cover and experienced a religious\nconversion.\n\nHe returned to the House of Berens in Riga, where they evidently\nforgave him his failure. He fell in love with Christoph Berens\u2019\nsister, Katharina, but was refused permission to marry her by his\nfriend, on the grounds of his religious conversion; Berens was an\nenthusiastic follower of the Enlightenment and was nauseated by the\nmore pious manifestations of Hamann\u2019s new-found religiosity.\nSmarting from this blow and its motivations, Hamann returned to his\nfather\u2019s house in K\u00f6nigsberg, where he lived for the rest\nof his life until his final months.\n\nIn K\u00f6nigsberg, he never held an official academic post, nor an\necclesiastical one; this may in part have been due to his pronounced\nspeech impediment, which inhibited him from either lecturing or\npreaching. Eventually, through the intercession of his acquaintance,\nImmanuel Kant, he found employment as a low-level civil servant\nworking in the tax office of Frederick the Great; a ruler Hamann in\nfact despised. Nevertheless his principal activity was as an editor\nand a writer; he was considered one of the most widely-read scholars\nof his time (greatly aided by his fluency in many languages), as well\nas a notorious author. During this time, despite his committed\nChristianity, he lived with a woman whom he never married but to whom\nhe remained devoted and faithful, having four children on whom he\ndoted, and who occasionally feature in his writings (principally as\nunruly distractions to the author\u2019s scholarship).\n\nAt the end of his life he accepted an invitation to M\u00fcnster from\none of his admirers, Princess Gallitzin. He died in M\u00fcnster in\n1788.\n\nHamann had a profound influence on the German \u2018Storm and\nStress\u2019 movement, and on other contemporaries such as Herder and\nJacobi; he impressed Hegel and Goethe (who called him the brightest\nhead of his time) and was a major influence on Kierkegaard. His\ninfluence continued on twentieth century German thinkers, particularly\nthose interested in language. His popularity has increased\ndramatically in the last few decades amongst philosophers,\ntheologians, and German studies scholars around the world.\n2. Writings\n\nHamann\u2019s writings are all short; he was not given to extensive\ntreatises. They are also usually motivated by something very specific:\nsomeone else\u2019s publication, or particular circumstances and\nevents. When responding to these, he presupposes considerable\nknowledge on the part of the reader; typically his responses to the\nwork of others involves adoption of their terminology and style,\nblending into mimicry and parody as a rhetorical and argumentative\ndevice. Moreover, woven into these writings is an extraordinary\nbreadth and quantity of citations and allusions; and by no means are\nthese all clear and obvious. Thus, when he chooses, his essays are a\ntapestry of multicolored threads of the ideas, language, and imagery\nof thinkers, be they ancient, biblical, or contemporary. These are\nwoven across a woof of a love of irony, which as ever adds a layer of\ninterpretative complexity.\n\nHamann\u2019s writings also frequently appear under the name of\nvarious fanciful characters: Aristobolus, the Knight of the\nRose-Cross, the Sibyl, Adelgunde. It cannot be assumed that such\ncharacters faithfully represent Hamann\u2019s own views; The opinions\nof Aristobolus, for example, are a device to deconstruct and drive to\nabsurdity a number of views which Hamann opposes.\n\nThese factors combine to make Hamann\u2019s writings notoriously\ndifficult to understand and interpret. Goethe observed that when\nreading Hamann, \u201cone must completely rule out what one normally\nmeans by understanding\u201d [Goethe, 550]. Even if one has \u2013\nor painfully acquires, or borrows from other current scholars \u2013\nthe breadth of reference to understand the source of an allusion or\ncitation, it is not always clear what the citation is doing there, and\nwhat Hamann means to suggest by referring to it. He delighted in\nsporting with his reader; preferring to present a balled fist and\nleave it to the reader to unroll it into a flat hand (to borrow one of\nhis own images; cf. the end of the \u201cMetacritique of the Purism\nof Reason\u201d, 1780).\n\nThis impenetrability has been taken by some to signify an incapacity\nfor clear expression on Hamann\u2019s part. Hegel remarked:\n\u201cThe French have a saying: Le stile c\u2019est\nl\u2019homme meme (\u2018The style is the man himself\u2019);\nHamann\u2019s writings do not have a particular style but\nrather are style through and through\u201d [Hegel, 209].\nOthers, however, have pointed to the clarity and concision of his\nletters, in contrast to the puzzling style he uses to address the\npublic. They suggest that Hamann\u2019s challenging style forms are\nan important part of Hamann\u2019s hermeneutics and his understanding\nof the relationship between the writer and reader: two halves of a\nwhole who must relate themselves to one another and unite for a common\ngoal (\u201cReader and Critic\u201d, 1762). The reader cannot be\npassive and must work to reconstruct Hamann\u2019s meaning. As Hamann\nobserved, \u201cA writer who is in a hurry to be understood today or\ntomorrow runs the danger of being misunderstood the day after\ntomorrow.\u201d\n\nConsequently, Hamann is highly susceptible to misinterpretation. For\nexample, one can find in recent English-language treatments the\nunderstanding of Hamann as an \u2018irrationalist\u2019, and one who\nsimply opposed the Enlightenment with all his might; this however is\nnot supported by the majority of Hamann scholars and is seen as a\nfailure to understand the complexity of his thinking.\n\nHis principal writings include: Biblische Betrachtungen\n[Biblical Reflections], Gedanken \u00fcber meinen Lebenslauf\n[Thoughts on the Course of my Life], Brocken [Fragments],\nSokratische Denkw\u00fcrdigkeiten [Socratic Memorabilia],\nWolken [Clouds], Kreuzz\u00fcge des Philologen\n[Crusades of the Philologian], a collection of essays including\nAesthetica in Nuce, Versuch \u00fcber eine akademische Frage\n[Essay on an academic question], and Kleeblatt Hellenistischer\nBriefe [Cloverleaf of Hellenistic Letters]; Schriftsteller\nund Kunstrichter [Author and Critic], Leser und\nKunstrichter [Reader and Critic], F\u00fcnf Hirtenbriefe\n[Five Pastoral Letters], Des Ritters von Rosencreuz letzte\nWillensmeynung \u00fcber den g\u00f6ttlichen und menschlichen Urprung\nder Sprache [The Knight of the Rose-Cross\u2019 Last Will and\nTestament on the divine and human origin of language],\nPhilologische Einf\u00e4lle und Zweifel [Philological Ideas\nand Doubts], Hierophantische Briefe [Hierophantic Letters],\nVersuch einer Sibylle \u00fcber die Ehe [Essay of a Sibyl on\nMarriage], Konxompax, Metakritik \u00fcber den Purismum der\nVernunft [Metacritique of the Purism of Reason], Golgotha und\nScheblimini [Golgotha and Scheblimini], Fliegender Brief\n[Flying Letter].\n3. Metacritique\n\nAt the end of his life, Hamann chose to designate his authorship as\n\u201cMetacritique\u201d, a word he coined for his engagement with\nKant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. Instead of creating a\nsystematic theology, or an epistemology, he seems to have seen his\nwork as one that examines the foundations and nature of philosophical\nand theological critique itself. Rather like the late Wittgenstein,\nhis work was deconstructive; he belongs in the camp of philosophers\nwhom Richard Rorty has described as \u201cedifying and\ntherapeutic\u201d rather than \u201cconstructive and\nsystematic\u201d (Rorty, 5\u20136). He brings to any issue in\nphilosophy not a constructive account, but an approach, a set of\nconvictions, something akin to ethical principles. He anticipated\nRorty\u2019s emphasis on the curative aspects of this task; at the\nend of his life, he wanted his collected works to be published under\nthe title \u201cCurative Baths\u201d\n(\u201cSaalbadereyen\u201d \u2014 a reference to healing\npractices of the time and an allusion to his father\u2019s\nprofession.) Each volume was to be called a \u2018Tub\u2019. This\nproject was sadly never realized, not even under a more conventional\ntitle.\n\nOne abiding characteristic of Hamann\u2019s many responses to the\nphilosophy of his time, therefore, is this \u2018metacritical\u2019\ninstinct: not to construct a rival account, but to go for the jugular;\nnot to set up a rival critique, but to insist that critique itself\nmust be subject to meta-critique, which concerns itself with the\nissues that must be attended to in relation to the act of\nphilosophical reflection itself. It consists of attention to the\nfundamental stance or position on issues or insights that must\nunderlie any work on philosophy or theology. According to Hamann,\noften \u201cthe difficulties lie in womb of the concepts\u201d (N\nIII, 31, 21). Hamann\u2019s writing therefore is not so much\n\u2018unsystematic\u2019 as is sometimes said, but\n\u2018presystematic\u2019. He addresses issues that must be\nrecognized in any self-critical reflection, matters that must be\npresuppositions for any system. Thus one of the most salient features\nof his \u201cMetacritique of the Purism of Reason\u201d, his\nunpublished response to Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason,\nwas to focus on the question of language. Through a tissue of imagery,\nhe suggests that a proper view of language implies that the alleged\n\u2018purity\u2019 of a priori reason is untenable.\n\nThese metacritical issues, for Hamann, principally include language,\nknowledge, and the nature of the human person. Hamann also, most\nurgently and most controversially (then as now), did not believe that\nany of these issues can be answered outside a theological perspective;\nthat is, without reference to God as humanity\u2019s creator and\ndialogue partner.\n4. Relation\n\nA second feature of Hamann\u2019s approach is a tendency which Goethe\nsaw as holism. This is perhaps not the best way to describe\nHamann\u2019s insight, as Hamann characteristically emphasised the\nbrokenness of human experience, and fragmentariness of human\nknowledge: \u201cGaps and lacks \u2026 is the highest and deepest\nknowledge of human nature, through which we must climb our way up to\nthe ideal \u2014 ideas and doubts \u2014 the summum bonum\nof our reason\u201d (ZH 3, 34:33\u201335). Hamann essentially\ndisliked attempts to isolate the phenomenon under consideration from\nother aspects with which he felt it to be intimately connected; this\nprecludes a deep and true understanding of our existence. Taken as far\nas he did, this means that philosophy of language must include a\ndiscussion of God, and a discussion of God must make reference to\nsexuality and vice versa.\n\nThus in \u201cEssay of a Sibyl on Marriage\u201d, which he takes as\nan opportunity to write about sex, a proper understanding of human\nsexuality and erotic enjoyment cannot be understood without seeing\nhumanity as the creature of God, made in God\u2019s image. He plays\nwith the Christian idea of God as a Trinity to depict a trinity of\nwoman-man-God in the moment of lovemaking; and reworks the account of\nthe creation of Adam in Genesis to describe the act of coitus itself.\nThe woman on perceiving her lover in his excitement sees \u2018that\nrib\u2019 and cries out in enthusiastic appropriation, \u2018That is\nbone of my bone and flesh of my flesh!\u2019 The man then\n\u2018fills the hole of the place with flesh\u2019 (as Genesis\ndescribes God doing with Adam after the creation of Eve). In doing so\nthe lover also acknowledges that the origin of a man is in\nwoman\u2019s body: the \u2018Sibyl\u2019 describes this moment of\nlovemaking as \u201che entered in whence he once came forth.\u201d\nIndeed, as Christ was born of a woman, the salvation of humanity\nproceeds from a woman\u2019s sexual body; the vagina is also\ndescribed as the place that the Saviour came forth as the body\u2019s\nhealer (the German language permits Hamann here to pun on\n\u2018healer\u2019 and \u2018saviour\u2019). This inclination to\ncombine topics more often kept separate (such as \u2018the concept of\nGod\u2019 and \u2018having sex\u2019) is salient throughout his\nwork.\n5. The Union of Opposites\n\nHamann\u2019s tool for conceiving the interrelation of these\ndimensions of human life increasingly was the Principle of the Union\nof Opposites. He writes approvingly of this principle to his friends;\nparticularly after his encounter with Kant\u2019s new epistemology,\nclaiming to value it more than the principles of contradiction and of\nsufficient reason, and indeed more than the whole Kantian Critique (ZH\n5, 327:12ff; ZH 4, 462:7\u20138). Contradictions and apparent\noppositions fill our experience:\n\nYes, daily at home I have the experience that one must always\ncontradict oneself from two viewpoints, [which] never can agree, and\nthat it is impossible to change these viewpoints into the other\nwithout doing the greatest violence to them. Our knowledge is\npiecemeal \u2014 no dogmatist is in a position to feel this great\ntruth, if he is to play his role and play it well; and through a\nvicious circle of pure reason skepsis itself becomes dogma (ZH 5,\n432:29\u201336). (This is in the context of a discussion of\nKant.)\n\nFar from being a pre-condition for truth, the absence of contradiction\nis in Hamann\u2019s eyes a pre-condition for dogmatism. Knowledge\nmust not proceed on the basis of unanimity and the absence of\ncontradiction, but must proceed through the dialogue and relation of\nthese different voices. (Hamann does not think in terms of\nHegel\u2019s later dialectical synthesis.) When Hamann speaks of\n\u2018opposition\u2019 and contradictions, however, he does so in an\nironic tone; for it is clearly his conviction that there is a\nfundamental unity in things, and the oppositions and contradictions\nthat we perceive are chiefly of our own making. He insists that his\nperception is \u2018without Manichaeism\u2019 (ZH 5,\n327:16\u201317). Body and mind, senses and reason, reason and passion\nare not truly opposed. These are contrasting elements of the same\nunified \u2014 unified but not homogenous \u2014 reality. Hamann\ntries to steer a course between Scylla and Charybdis: between the\ndogmatic, even tyrannical extermination of opposition and\ncontradiction; and the elimination of contradiction through a false\nsynthesis or fusion achieved by an apparent acceptance of antithetical\nrealities.\n\nThe Principle of the Union of Opposites as a tactical tool, therefore,\ndoes not imply that Hamann sees the world in terms of divisions and\ndualism. It is his strategy for coping with the schematic antitheses\nabundant in Enlightenment philosophy.\n\nNothing seems easier than the leap from one extreme to the other, and\nnothing so difficult as the union to a center. \u2026 [The Union of\nOpposites] always seems to me to be the one sufficient reason of all\ncontradictions \u2014 and the true process of their resolution and\nmediation, that makes an end to all feuds of healthy reason and pure\nunreason. (ZH 4, 287:5\u201317)\n\n6. \u2018Prosopopoeia\u2019\n\nHamann used the notion of \u2018Prosopopoeia\u2019, or\npersonification, as an image of what can happen in philosophical\nreflection. In a medieval morality or mystery play, the experience of\nbeing chaste or being lustful is transformed from a way of acting or\nfeeling into a dramatic character who then speaks and acts as a\npersonification of that quality. So too in philosophy, Hamann\nsuggests. The philosopher distinguishes differing aspects in the\nphenomenon under scrutiny and exaggerates their difference. These\naspects are ennobled into faculties, and through\n\u2018prosopopoeia\u2019 are hypostasized into entities. Thus in the\nact of reflecting on something, \u2018reasoning\u2019 is\ndistinguished from \u2018feeling\u2019, and turned from a verb or\ngerund into a noun \u2014 \u2018reason\u2019\u2014which is then\nnamed as a constituent of our being. Reason then becomes a thing to\nwhich we can ascribe properties. (This shows perhaps a streak\nbordering on nominalism in Hamann.)\n\nThe best example of this, and of Hamann\u2019s response, is his\ntreatment of the word \u2018reason\u2019. Since he handles it with a\nkind of skepticism or even distaste, he is often called an\n\u2018irrationalist\u2019. It is clear however that Hamann puts a\nhigh value on certain ways of being reasonable and of reasoning\nactivity. \u201cWithout language we would have no reason,\nwithout reason no religion, and without these three essential aspects\nof our nature, neither mind [Geist] nor bond of\nsociety\u201d (N III, 231, 10\u201312).\n\nHamann\u2019s treatment of reason instead is a deconstruction, both\nof the prosopopoeic use of the word and the Enlightenment valuation of\nit. There is no such thing as reason \u2014 there is only reasoning.\nReasoning, as something we do, is as fallible as we are, and as such\nis subject to our position in history, or own personality, or the\ncircumstances of the moment. \u2018It\u2019 is therefore not a\nuniversal, healthy and infallible \u2018faculty\u2019 as\nHamann\u2019s Enlightenment contemporaries often maintained:\n\nBeing, belief and reason are pure relations, which cannot be\ndealt with absolutely, and are not things but pure scholastic\nconcepts, signs for understanding, not for worshipping, aids\nto awaken our attention, not to fetter it. (ZH 7, 165:7\u201311)\n\n7. Enlightenment\n\nHamann is sometimes portrayed simply as an opponent of \u201cthe\nEnlightenment\u201d. This presupposes of course that \u201cthe\nEnlightenment\u201d constitutes a unified stance on a number of\nphilosophical issues, an assumption which is questionable. The\nmajority of Hamann scholars today see his position in a more complex\nway. Hamann opposed many of the popular convictions of his time.\nHowever, Hamann fought his contemporaries on many fronts; therefore\nthere were often areas of considerable agreement with some of his\nopponents. One example would be the way that he deployed Hume as a\nweapon against Enlightenment rationalism, not least against Kant\n(although Hamann was the one who introduced Kant to Hume\u2019s\nwritings in the first place). Although Hamann, as a Christian, had\nprofound disagreements with Hume\u2019s thought in its atheistic\naspects, nevertheless he used Humean skepticism in his own\ndeconstructive writings. Hume\u2019s doubts about the reliability and\nself-sufficiency of reason were grist to Hamann\u2019s mill.\nHume\u2019s insistence that \u201cbelief\u201d underlies much of\nour thinking and reasoning was adopted and deployed by Hamann, often\nwith a linguistic sleight of hand. By using the word\n\u201cGlaube\u201d (which in German includes both\n\u201cbelief\u201d in an epistemic sense and \u201cfaith\u201d in\na religious sense), Hamann could assert that \u201cfaith\u201d, not\nrational grounds, underlies his contemporaries\u2019 high valuation\nof reason. Thus even the enthusiastic advocates of impartiality and\n\u201creason\u201d, who are also skeptics about \u201cblind\nfaith\u201d, have ultimately only faith as the ground for their\nconvictions.\n\nJudging from letters late in his life, Hamann preferred to be seen as\na \u201cmetacritic\u201d of the Enlightenment. His dissatisfactions\nwith what he viewed as a certain Enlightenment program began early,\nfollowing his conversion to Christianity; and his challenge could be\nseen not as a blunt, unreasoning opposition to rationality, but as a\ndeeper (and more disruptive) challenge to what rationality and\nEnlightenment actually consist in. Often these are seen in his\nresonses to his friend Immanuel Kant. An early challenge came in his\nfirst public essay, \u201cSocratic Memorabilia\u201d (1759), which\nwas dedicated to Kant and their mutual friend Christoph Berens. Kant\nand Berens had sought to cast him as a campaigner on behalf of the\nEnlightenment. In the essay he portrays Socrates, the hero of the\nEnlightenment, as a Christ-figure rather than a champion of secular\nreason. Hamann\u2019s abreaction to what he viewed as a misguided\ndeification and purification of reason reaches a climax in 1784, in\nhis unpublished response to Kant \u2014 \u201cMetacritique of the\nPurism of Reason\u201d (1984) and in an inflamed private letter to\nChristian Jacob Kraus in the same year. This letter takes issue with\nKant\u2019s famous essay \u201cAn Answer to the Question: What is\nEnlightenment?\u201d (1984). Here he argues that what Kant describes\nas the intellectual \u201cself-incurred minority\u201d (minority in\nthe sense of being a minor, immaturity, tutelage) of the general\npublic, an (alleged) need to be told what to think, is not\nself-imposed. Rather, it is imposed, Hamann suggests, on the one hand\nby a politically authoritarian regime hostile to dissent and political\nfree-thinking, while encouraging religious free-thinking; and on the\nother hand by professional experts: the \u201cprattle and reasoning\nof those emancipated immature ones, who set themselves up as\nguardians\u201d. \u201cTrue enlightenment,\u201d Hamann concludes\nsarcastically, \u201cconsists in an emergence of the immature person\nfrom a supremely self-incurred guardianship.\u201d\n8. Language\n\nLanguage is one of Hamann\u2019s most abiding philosophical concerns.\nFrom the beginning of his work, Hamann championed the priority which\nexpression and communication, passion and symbol possess over\nabstraction, analysis and logic in matters of language. Neither logic\nnor even representation (in Rorty\u2019s sense) possesses the rights\nof the first-born. Representation is secondary and derivative rather\nthan the whole function of language. Symbolism, imagery, metaphor have\nprimacy; \u201cPoetry is the mother-tongue of the human race\u201d\n(N II, 197). To think that language is essentially a passive system of\nsigns for communicating thoughts is to deal a deathblow to true\nlanguage.\n\nFor all Hamann\u2019s emphasis in his earlier writings on passion and\nemotion, he does not equate language with emotional expression. This\nbecame clear in his engagement with the writing of his younger friend\nHerder on the origin of language. Language has a mediating\nrelationship between our reflection, one another, and our world; and\nas it is not simply the cries of emotion of an animal, so too it is\nnot a smothering curtain between us and the rest of reality. Language\nalso has a mediating role between God and us. Hamann\u2019s answer to\na debate of his time, the origin of language \u2014 divine or\nhuman?\u2014is that its origin is found in the relationship between\nGod and humanity. Typically he has the \u2018Knight of the\nRose-Cross\u2019 express this in the form of a \u2018myth\u2019,\nrather than attempting to work out such a claim logically and\nsystematically. Rewriting the story of the Garden of Eden, he\ndescribes this paradise as:\n\nEvery phenomenon of nature was a word,\u2014the sign, symbol and\npledge of a new, mysterious, inexpressible but all the more intimate\nunion, participation and community of divine energies and ideas.\nEverything the human being heard from the beginning, saw with its\neyes, looked upon and touched with its hands was a living word; for\nGod was the word. (NIII, 32: 21\u201330)\n\n\nThis makes the origin of language as easy and natural as child\u2019s\nplay.\n\nBy the end of his life, because of his engagement with Kant, the most\nurgent question among the relationships that constitute language is\nthe relationship of language to thinking or \u2018reason\u2019. In\nhis view, the central question of Kant\u2019s first\nCritique, the very possibility of a priori knowledge\nand of pure reason, depends on the nature of language. In a passage\nfull of subtle allusions to Kantian passages and terms, he writes:\n\nIndeed, if a chief question does remain: how is the power to think\npossible?\u2014The power to think right and left,\nbefore and without, with and above experience?\nthen it does not take a deduction to prove the genealogical priority\nof language\u2026. Not only the entire ability to think rests on\nlanguage... but language is also the crux of the misunderstanding\nof reason with itself. (N III, 286:1\u201310)\n\n\nLanguage is forced to take part in the \u2018purification of\nphilosophy\u2019, as he describes it in his Metacritique of Kant: the\nattempt to expunge experience and tradition from rational reflection.\nLanguage itself is the final victim in this threefold\n\u2018purification\u2019. It is for this reason however that\nlanguage can constitute the cure for philosophy. Language is the\nembodiment of experience and tradition; as long as the ability to\nthink rests on language, neither \u2018reason\u2019 nor\n\u2018philosophy\u2019 can be pure of the empirical, of experience,\nand of the experience of the others to whom we relate. It itself, for\nHamann, embodies a relation: it itself is a \u2018union of\nopposites\u2019, of the aesthetic and the logical, the bodily and the\nintellectual; it unites the divisions Kant\u2019s Critique\ncreates.\n\nFor Hamann, in contrast to Kant, the question is therefore not so much\n\u2018what is reason?\u2019 as \u2018what is language?\u2019, as\nhe writes in a letter. This is the ground of the paralogisms and\nantinomies that Kant raises in his Critique. Sharing Hume\u2019s\nempiricism and Berkeley\u2019s suspicion of universals and abstract\nterms, he concludes: \u201cHence it happens that one takes\nwords for concepts, and concepts for the\nthings themselves\u201d (ZH 5, 264:34\u2013265:1). Language\nthen has a fundamental role to play in unmasking the\nphilosopher\u2019s tendency to \u2018prosopopoeia\u2019. The\nrelation of language to reason he certainly did not feel had solved,\nhowever, as he wrote to a friend:\n\nIf only I was as eloquent as Demosthenes, I would have to do no more\nthan repeat a single word three times. Reason is language\u2014Logos;\nI gnaw on this marrowbone and will gnaw myself to death over it. It is\nstill always dark over these depths for me: I am still always awaiting\nan apocalyptic angel with a key to this abyss. (ZH 5, 177:16\u201321)\n\n9. Knowledge\n\nFor Hamann, knowledge is inseparable from self-knowledge, and\nself-knowledge inseparable from knowledge of the other. We are\nvisible, as in a mirror, in each other; \u201cGod and my neighbor are\ntherefore a part of my self-knowledge, my self-love\u201d (N I,\n302:16\u201323). He writes in a letter: \u201cSelf knowledge begins with\nthe neighbor, the mirror, and just the same with true self-love; that\ngoes from the mirror to the matter\u201d (ZH 6, 281:16\u201317).\nSometimes this exploration of self-knowledge through interpersonal\nintimacy takes a sexual form, as in the Sibyl\u2019s Essay on\nMarriage (already discussed).\n\nAll forms of knowledge, of learning and development even of the most\nnatural functions, require the help of another. (The \u2018Knight of\nthe Rose Cross\u2019, while jesting with Hume, tells us ironically\nthat even eating and drinking, and indeed excretion, are not\ninstinctual or innate but require teaching.) (N III, 28:26\u201328; N\nIII, 29:7\u201310) This is conceived not only in such immediately\ninterpersonal ways, but also more widely in the context of the\ncommunity. The indispensability of \u2018the other\u2019 for\nknowledge is also the reason that Hamann gives the importance he does\nto tradition in the formation of knowledge. \u201cOur reason arises,\nat the very least, from this twofold lesson of sensuous revelations\nand human testimonies\u201d (N III 29:28\u201330). Years before\nKant\u2019s first Critique, Hamann attempts to relate the\nsenses and the understanding and their roles in knowledge, using a\ncharacteristically concrete metaphor: the senses are like the stomach,\nthe understanding like blood vessels. Not only do the blood vessels\nneed the stomach to receive the nourishment that they distribute; the\nstomach also needs the blood vessels to function. This insistence on\nthe mutual dependency and interrelation of sense experience and\nunderstanding (as opposed to many Enlightenment views that plumped for\neither reason or the senses as the dominant party) was refined in his\nengagement with Kant\u2019s critique. Throughout his life, he was\nneither materialist, purely empiricist or positivist, nor idealist,\nrationalist or intellectualist in his epistemology. Rather, he is\nfirmly against dividing knowledge or ways of knowing into different\nkinds. \u201cThe philosophers have always given truth a bill of\ndivorce, by separating what nature has joined together and vice\nversa\u201d (N III, 40: 3\u20135). With Kant\u2019s critique, the\nproblem becomes still more urgent; Kant\u2019s treatment of the issue\nis a \u201cviolent, unwarranted, obstinate divorce of what nature has\njoined together\u201d. Revising Kant\u2019s metaphor of sensibility\nand understanding as two stems of human knowledge, he suggests we see\nknowledge as a single stem with two roots. Thus he rejects the\ndivision of what can be known a priori from what can be known\na posteriori, and many of the consequences of such a stance. Here\nagain he reaches for the \u2018Principle of the Union of\nOpposites\u2019 in his deployment of imagery to suggest a different\napproach. The relation of the senses and understanding is a\n\u2018hypostatic union\u2019, a \u2018communicatio\nidiomatum\u2019 (phrases borrowed from Christian theological\ndiscussion of how the two natures of divine and human are united in\nChrist). This mysterious union can only be revealed and understood by\n\u2018ordinary language\u2019. (In suggesting that the problems in\nphilosophy can be cured by attending to \u2018ordinary\nlanguage\u2019, he clearly anticipates the late Wittgenstein).\n\nIn this engagement with Kant, Hamann returns and deepens the lesson he\nhad learnt much earlier in his reading of Hume: that belief or faith\nis an essential precursor for knowledge. Everything is dependent or\ngrounded on faith; there is no privileged position for any kind or\nform of knowledge (a priori, scientific, etc.) In Hamann\u2019s\nepistemology, the hard division between \u2018knowledge\u2019 and\n\u2018belief\u2019 or \u2018faith\u2019 becomes eroded. Both\nknowledge and faith rest on a foundation of trust; neither rest on a\nfoundation of indubitability. \u201cEvery philosophy consists of\ncertain and uncertain knowledge, of idealism and realism, of\nsensuousness and deductions. Why should only the uncertain be called\nbelief? What then are\u2014rational grounds?\u201d (ZH 7,\n165:33\u201337) \u2018Sensuousness\u2019 translates\nSinnlichkeit (Kant\u2019s \u2018sensibility\u2019). Belief\nand reason both need each other; idealism and realism are a fantasized\nopposition, of which the authentic use of reason knows nothing. The\nunity that lies in the nature of things should lie at the foundation\nof all our concepts and reflection (ZH 7, 165:7\u201317).\n10. Interpretation and Understanding\n\nFrom his \u2018debut\u2019 work, Socratic Memorabilia,\nHamann began to promulgate a particular view of what it means to\nunderstand something. From the beginning of that essay he emphasized\nthe importance of passion and commitment in interpretation;\nundermining the more conventional assumption that objectivity and\ndetachment are prerequisites of philosophical reflection and\nunderstanding. In Aesthetica in Nuce, wearing the authorial\nmask of the \u2018kabbalistic philologian\u2019, he provocatively\nmaintained that initiation into orgies were necessary before the\ninterpreter could safely begin the hermeneutical act. The idea that\none must rid oneself of presuppositions, prejudices, and predilections\nin order to do justice to the subject matter he characterizes as\n\u2018monastic rules\u2019\u2014i.e. an excessive asceticism and\nabstinence. He goes so far as to compare such individuals to\nself-castrating eunuchs (N II, 207:10\u201320).\n\nHamann\u2019s skepticism about neutrality and objectivity does not\nmake him a \u2018subjectivist\u2019, however. The stance and\ndisposition of the interpreter is integral, helpful, indeed,\nindispensable and must be acknowledged; but limitless subjectivity\narouses Hamann\u2019s scorn. Those who \u2018flood the text\u2019\nwith glosses and marginalia, \u201cdreaming up one\u2019s own\ninspiration and interpretation,\u201d Hamann likens to the blind\nleading the blind (N II, 208:3ff).\n\nThe constraints which Hamann places on the interpreter\u2019s\nsubjectivity are not those usually advocated, therefore: an avoidance\nof prejudice and pre-conceptions; an amnesia for one\u2019s own\nhistory, tradition and culture; an obedience to exegetical rules. The\nfirst restraint on subjective distortion is the interpreter\u2019s\nown common sense; the last is the reaction of the text itself:\n\u201cwhat are you trying to make of me?\u201d The\ninterpreter\u2019s freedom is inextricable from the\ninterpreter\u2019s respect and responsibility, in Hamann\u2019s\nview.\n\nThe responsible interpreter is conscious of standing within something\nlarger than oneself: a tradition. The wise interpreter is a kabbalist,\none who interprets an ancient text, and a rhapsodist\u2014the\noriginal meaning of the latter being one who stitches something\ntogether from pre-existing materials. (In Ancient Greece the\n\u2018rhapsodist\u2019 was one who recited poems cobbled together\nfrom prior sources, usually bits of Homer.) In creating\ninterpretations, the interpreter enjoys the freedom to create anew, as\nHamann created his characteristic prose from pre-existing texts, while\ncreating a new meaningful piece. Hamann\u2019s use of this genre\nitself makes the point: the demand that only one meaning may exist for\na text arises from an impoverished notion of meaning and creativity;\none that misunderstands the nature of composition and the nature of\ninterpretation alike.\n\nHamann\u2019s rejected both exegetical \u2018materialism\u2019 and\n\u2018idealism\u2019, as he called them \u2014 literalism and\nexcessive flights of fancy. In thus insisting on the integrity of\n\u2018the letter and the spirit\u2019, he means to preserve\nthe place of author, text and reader alike. Both meaning and\ninterpretation rest in a three-way relationship.\n\nFor Hamann, the depth and meaning of a text go beyond the\nauthor\u2019s own contribution, and are the responsibility of the\ninterpreter: \u201cFew authors understand themselves, and a proper\nreader must not only understand his author but also be able\nto see beyond him\u201d (ZH 6, 22:10\u201312). And yet this\nrecognition that the author\u2019s opinions and intentions do not\nexhaust the possibilities of the text does not annihilate the place of\nthe author. At the very least, the \u2018beyond\u2019 of the text\nincludes a territory which, if unknown to the author, is not\nunrelated: that is, the author\u2019s own unconscious workings and\nmeanings. It is not accidental that Hamann observes not that\nfew authors understand their own text, but that few authors\nunderstand themselves. This suggests a picture of creation in\nwhich more of the author is expressed in a text and entrusted to the\ninterpreter than the author\u2019s conscious intentions and opinions.\nThis in turn suggests a picture of interpretation\u2014of\n\u201cunderstanding one\u2019s hero\u201d as Hamann put it when\nwriting about Socrates\u2014in which greater sensitivity, insight,\nand fidelity is demanded of the interpreter than would otherwise be\nthe case. Above all, the interpreter must have the courage to be a\nkabbalist; that is, to say more than the text does, not to express\noneself but to say what the author left unsaid. The fruits of such\nfaithful creativity may be impossible to \u2018justify\u2019 or\n\u2018verify\u2019 to the demands of the objectivist, however.\n\nFundamentally, for Hamann hermeneutics consists in perceiving the\nunderlying relationship beneath the phenomenon in question; at the\nleast, of course, the relationship between the author and the\ninterpreter which requires such fidelity. Given Hamann\u2019s\nreligious views, this at once introduces a theological dimension.\nUltimately, this means that for Hamann proper hermeneutics rests on\none thing: perceiving God revealed within the phenomenon, whether that\nbe nature or history (cf. Socratic Memorabilia and\nAesthetica in Nuce for examples). Even the interpretation of\nourselves is a revelation of God; a recognition of whose image solves\nall the most complicated knots and riddles of our nature (N II,\n206:32\u2013207:2; 198:3\u20135).\n11. Humanity\n\nThe topics examined so far all have their anthropological\nimplications. Hamann\u2019s critique of the socio-political\nimplications of Kant\u2019s vision of \u2018enlightenment\u2019\nrests on a conviction about our social and political destiny. Hamann\nsees our socio-political vocation as consisting firstly in\n\u2018criticism\u2019 (or \u2018critique\u2019)\u2014recognizing\nand appropriating, or hating and rejecting, the true vs. the false,\ngood vs. evil, beautiful vs. ugly; and secondly in\n\u2018politics\u2019, which is increasing or reducing them. This is\nnot the prerogative of the ruler; every one is at once their own\n\u2018king\u2019, their own \u2018legislator\u2019; but also the\n\u2018first-born of their subjects\u2019. It is our\n\u201crepublican privilege\u201d to contribute to this destiny,\n\u201cthe critical and magisterial office of a political\nanimal\u201d (N III, 38\u201339).\n\nThe concepts of knowledge and language and their many facets also\nimply a particular anthropology: the diversity yet integration of the\nhuman being. For Hamann, the truest picture of humanity is of\ndiversity in unity; a number of different, often contrasting aspects\nand features together composing the human person. Hamann consequently\ndid not confine his attention to epistemology and reason when\nconsidering what human beings are, and passion, the thirst for\nvengeance, and sexual ecstasy form a part of his picture as well. (In\nresponse to the Enlightenment aesthetic of art as the imitation of\n\u2018beautiful nature\u2019, Hamann\u2019s ironic observation was:\n\u201cThe thirst for vengeance was the beautiful nature which Homer\nimitated\u201d (ZH 2, 157:12).)\n\nThe theme of interdependence between human beings, which was\nemphasized in his epistemology, also has its roots in his\nunderstanding of what it is to be human. We are not self-sufficient;\nbut for Hamann, even our lacks and failings have a positive thrust,\nthis signifier of dependency making us all the more suited for the\nenjoyment of nature and one another.\n\nIf there is a fundamental key to his thinking on humanity, it is the\nidea that the human being is the image of God. This is admittedly more\ntheological than philosophical, but is essential for understanding\nHamann\u2019s philosophical anthropology. Hamann\u2019s treatment of\nthis perennial theme is hardly conventional in the history of\nChristian thinking. While the experience of sinfulness and wickedness\nis a powerful theme, particularly in his earlier, post-conversion\nwriting, the fundamental thrust of his thinking is the easy exchange\nbetween the human and the divine. In this exchange, language is\n\u201cthe sign, symbol and pledge of a new, mysterious, inexpressible\nbut all the more intimate union, participation and community of divine\nenergies and ideas\u201d (N III, 32:21\u201324). Despite his\nreputation for being an irrationalist, reasoning too relates us to\nGod; God, nature and reason are described as having the same relation\nas light, the eye and what we see, or as author, text and reader (ZH\n5, 272:14\u201316).\n\nOne must also remember that Hamann confessed that he could not\nconceive of a Creative Spirit without genitalia; indeed, he was quite\nhappy to assert that the genitals are the unique bond between creature\nand Creator. So sexuality in divine-human relations has two aspects.\nFirst, as paradigm of creativity, it is the way in which our\nGod-likeness can most strikingly be seen. Secondly, as the point of\nthe most profound unity, it is the locus for our union both with\nanother human being and with the divine. Provocatively, Hamann sees\noriginal sin and its rebellion as embodied not in sexuality, but in\nreason. Overweening reason is our attempt to be like God; meanwhile,\nprudery is the rejection of God\u2019s image, while trying to be like\nGod in the wrong sense (bodilessness). (See Essay of a Sibyl on\nMarriage and Konxompax.) One should therefore distinguish\n\u2018likeness to God\u2019 from \u2018being equal to God\u2019.\nIn the Sibyl\u2019s essay, the male version of grasping at equality\nwith God (cf. Phil. 2:6) is the attempt to be self-sufficient, to be\nthe God of monotheism: the sole ruler, who possesses self-existence.\nInstead, the encounter with the opposite sex should engender in the\nman an attitude of profound respect towards the woman\u2019s body, as\nthe source of his own existence, from his mother. As the source of his\nown joy, lovemaking also is an acknowledgement of his own dependence,\nhis lack of self-sufficiency and autonomy. But this dependence on\nanother paradoxically is the Godlikeness of the Creator, the father,\nthe one who humbles himself in self-giving (a favourite Hamannian\ntheme in his discussion of God). Meanwhile, the woman\u2019s\ntemptation is to an artificial innocence; a secret envy of God\u2019s\nincorporeality and impassibility. The defence of one\u2019s virginity\nis another cryptic attempt at self-sufficiency. Instead, the woman\nmust brave the \u2018tongues of fire\u2019 in a \u2018sacrifical\noffering of innocence\u2019, in order to realize her Godlikeness;\nwhich is not to be found in bodilessness and the absence of passion,\nbut in passionate creativity; in the willingness to be incarnate.\nThus, if human beings are in the image of God, it is a trinitarian\nimage of God, a mutual relation of love of \u2018Father\u2019,\n\u2018Son\u2019 and \u2018Spirit\u2019; found in creating, in\nsaving, and in tongues of fire.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Hamann\u2019s writings", "Hamann\u2019s Letters", "Other selections", "Other editions and commentaries, in German", "English translations and commentaries", "Monographs and Studies in English", "Literature reviews", "The International Hamann-Colloquium", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Hamann\u2019s writings": "</h3>\n<p>\nHamann\u2019s works, including those unpublished in his lifetime,\nwere reprinted in a collection edited by Josef Nadler:</p>\n<blockquote>\nHamann, Johann Georg, <em>S\u00e4mtliche Werken</em>, edited by Josef\nNadler, 6 volumes, Vienna: Verlag Herder, 1949\u20131957; reprinted\nWuppertal: Brockhaus, 1999.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nCitations from this source, in conformity with common practice for\nHamann references, are given above as: N II, 13:10.
