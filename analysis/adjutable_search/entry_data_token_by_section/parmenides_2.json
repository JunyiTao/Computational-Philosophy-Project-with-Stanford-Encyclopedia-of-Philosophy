    "main_text": "Overview of Parmenides\u2019 Poem || The Ways of Inquiry\n2.2 The Ways of Inquiry\n\nImmediately after welcoming Parmenides to her abode, the goddess\ndescribes as follows the content of the revelation he is about to\nreceive:\n\nYou must needs learn all things,/ both the unshaken heart of\nwell-rounded reality/ and the notions of mortals, in which there is no\ngenuine trustworthiness./ Nonetheless these things too will you learn,\nhow what they resolved/ had actually to be, all through all pervading.\n(Fr. 1.28b-32)\n\n\nThis programmatic announcement already indicates that the\ngoddess\u2019 revelation will come in two major phases. The goddess\nprovides some further instruction and admonition before commencing the\nfirst phase, the demonstration of the nature of what she here\nmysteriously calls \u201cthe unshaken heart of well-rounded\nreality\u201d (fr. 1.29). She then follows this first phase of her\nrevelation with what in the originally complete poem was a much longer\naccount of the principles, origins, and operation of the cosmos and\nits constituents, from the heavens and the sun, moon, and stars right\ndown to the earth and its population of living creatures, including\nhumans themselves. This second phase, a cosmological account in the\ntraditional Presocratic mold, is what she here refers to as \u201cthe\nnotions of mortals, in which there is no genuine\ntrustworthiness\u201d (fr. 1.30).\n\nThe governing motif of the goddess\u2019 revelation is that of the\n\u201cways of inquiry.\u201d In the all-important fragment 2, she\nspecifies two such ways:\n\nCome now, I shall tell\u2014and convey home the tale once you have\nheard\u2014/just which ways of inquiry alone there are for\nunderstanding:/ the one, that [it] is and that [it] is not not to be,/\nis the path of conviction, for it attends upon true reality,/ but the\nother, that [it] is not and that [it] must not be,/ this, I tell you,\nis a path wholly without report:/ for neither could you apprehend what\nis not, for it is not to be accomplished,/ nor could you indicate it.\n(Fr. 2)\n\n\nThe second way of inquiry is here set aside virtually as soon as it is\nintroduced. The goddess goes on to refer back to the first way of\ninquiry and then speaks of another way as characteristic of mortal\ninquiry:\n\nIt is necessary to say and to think that What Is is; for it is to be,/\nbut nothing it is not. These things I bid you ponder./ For I shall\nbegin for you from this first way of inquiry,/ then yet again from\nthat along which mortals who know nothing/ wander two-headed: for\nhaplessness in their/ breasts directs wandering understanding. They\nare borne along/ deaf and blind at once, bedazzled, undiscriminating\nhordes,/ who have supposed that it is and is not the same/ and not the\nsame; but the path of all these turns back on itself. (Fr. 6,\nsupplementing the lacuna at the end of verse 3 with\narx\u00f4 and taking s\u2019 earlier in the verse\nas an elision of soi, as per Nehamas 1981, 103\u20135; cf.\nthe similar proposal at Cordero 1984, ch. 3, expanding parts of\nCordero 1979.)\n\n\nHere the goddess again articulates the division of her revelation into\nthe two major phases first announced at the end of fragment 1. Compare\nher subsequent pronouncement at the point of transition from the first\nphase\u2019s account of reality to the second phase\u2019s\ncosmology: \u201cAt this point I cease for you the trustworthy\naccount and meditation/ regarding true reality; from this point on\nmortal notions/ learn, listening to the deceptive order of my\nverses\u201d (fr. 8.50\u20132).\n\nClearly, the goddess\u2019 account of \u201ctrue reality\u201d\nproceeds along the first way of inquiry introduced in fragment 2. Some\nhave thought the cosmology proceeds along the second way of inquiry\nintroduced at fr. 2.5, on the ground that the two ways introduced in\nfragment 2 appear to be presented as the only conceivable ways of\ninquiry. However, the way presented in fragment 6, as that along which\nwanders the thought of mortals \u201cwho have supposed that it is and\nis not the same and not the same\u201d (fr. 6.7\u20138a), involves\nan intermingling of being and not-being altogether different from what\none sees in the way of inquiry earlier specified as \u201cthat [it]\nis not and that [it] must not be\u201d (fr. 2.5). Fragment 6 thus\nappears to be introducing a third and different way, one not to be\nidentified with fragment 2\u2019s second way, which has already been\nset aside. The same mixture of being and non-being likewise features\nin the goddess\u2019 warning to Parmenides in fragment 7 not to allow\nhis thought to proceed along the way typical of mortal inquiries:\n\u201c\u2026for this may never be made manageable, that things that\nare not are./ But you from this way of inquiry restrain your\nunderstanding,/ and do not let habit born of much experience force you\nalong this way,/ to employ aimless sight and echoing hearing/ and\ntongue. But judge by reason the strife-filled critique/ I have\ndelivered\u201d (fr. 7). Some have thought that here the\ngoddess\u2019s last directive signals that some argument, with\nidentifiable premises and conclusion, has been presented in the\npreceding verses. She in fact appears to be indicating that her harsh\ncriticism of the inapprehension of ordinary humans, resulting from\ntheir exclusive reliance on the senses, has been designed to keep\nParmenides firmly planted on the first way of inquiry.\n",
