    "main_text": "Related themes\n5. Related themes\n\nWhen philosophers think about markets and their place and role in\nsociety, they need to be aware of the fact that theories\nabout markets can sometimes carry their own implicit value\njudgments. This is why they need to be sensitive to methodological\nquestions of the scientific discipline that focuses on markets, i.e.\neconomics. When it comes to normative conclusions, political\nphilosophers should also take into account the arguments brought\nforward by business ethicists, who discuss the moral duties of market\nparticipants. As Heath et al. (2010) have recently argued, debates in\nbusiness ethics and in political philosophy would benefit from being\nmore closely integrated, and this holds in particular for debates\nabout markets. In this final section, these two related themes are\nbriefly discussed. \n",
