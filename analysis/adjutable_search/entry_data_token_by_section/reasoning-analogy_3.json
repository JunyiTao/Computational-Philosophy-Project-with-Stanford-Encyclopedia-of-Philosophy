    "main_text": "Analogical arguments || Plausibility\n2.3 Plausibility\n\nTo say that a hypothesis is plausible is to convey that it has\nepistemic support: we have some reason to believe it, even prior to\ntesting. An assertion of plausibility within the context of an inquiry\ntypically has pragmatic connotations as well: to say that a hypothesis\nis plausible suggests that we have some reason to investigate it\nfurther. For example, a mathematician working on a proof regards a\nconjecture as plausible if it \u201chas some chances of\nsuccess\u201d (Polya 1954 (v. 2): 148). On both points, there is\nambiguity as to whether an assertion of plausibility is categorical or\na matter of degree. These observations point to the existence of two\ndistinct conceptions of plausibility, probabilistic and\nmodal, either of which may reflect the intended conclusion of\nan analogical argument.\n\nOn the probabilistic conception, plausibility is naturally\nidentified with rational credence (rational subjective degree of\nbelief) and is typically represented as a probability. A classic\nexpression may be found in Mill\u2019s analysis of the argument from\nanalogy in A System of Logic:\n\n\nThere can be no doubt that every resemblance [not known to be\nirrelevant] affords some degree of probability, beyond what would\notherwise exist, in favour of the conclusion. (Mill 1843/1930:\n333)\n\n\nIn the terminology introduced in\n \u00a72.2,\n Mill\u2019s idea is that each element of the positive analogy boosts\nthe probability of the conclusion. Contemporary\n\u2018structure-mapping\u2019 theories\n (\u00a73.4)\n employ a restricted version: each structural similarity\nbetween two domains contributes to the overall measure of similarity,\nand hence to the strength of the analogical argument.\n\nOn the alternative modal conception, \u2018it is plausible\nthat \\(p\\)\u2019 is not a matter of degree. The meaning, roughly\nspeaking, is that there are sufficient initial grounds for taking\n\\(p\\) seriously, i.e., for further investigation (subject to\nfeasibility and interest). Informally: \\(p\\) passes an initial\nscreening procedure. There is no assertion of degree. Instead,\n\u2018It is plausible that\u2019 may be regarded as an epistemic\nmodal operator that aims to capture a notion, prima facie\nplausibility, that is somewhat stronger than ordinary epistemic\npossibility. The intent is to single out \\(p\\) from an\nundifferentiated mass of ideas that remain bare epistemic\npossibilities. To illustrate: in 1769, Priestley\u2019s argument\n (Example 9),\n if successful, would establish the prima facie plausibility\nof an inverse square law for electrostatic attraction. The set of\nepistemic possibilities\u2014hypotheses about electrostatic\nattraction compatible with knowledge of the day\u2014was much larger.\nIndividual analogical arguments in mathematics (such as\n Example 7)\n are almost invariably directed towards prima facie\nplausibility.\n\nThe modal conception figures importantly in some discussions of\nanalogical reasoning. The physicist N. R. Campbell (1957) writes:\n\n\nBut in order that a theory may be valuable it must \u2026 display an\nanalogy. The propositions of the hypothesis must be analogous to some\nknown laws\u2026. (1957: 129)\n\n\nCommenting on the role of analogy in Fourier\u2019s theory of heat\nconduction, Campbell writes:\n\n\nSome analogy is essential to it; for it is only this analogy\nwhich distinguishes the theory from the multitude of others\u2026\nwhich might also be proposed to explain the same laws. (1957: 142)\n\n\nThe interesting notion here is that of a \u201cvaluable\u201d\ntheory. We may not agree with Campbell that the existence of analogy\nis \u201cessential\u201d for a novel theory to be\n\u201cvaluable.\u201d But consider the weaker thesis that an\nacceptable analogy is sufficient to establish that a theory\nis \u201cvaluable\u201d, or (to qualify still further) that an\nacceptable analogy provides defeasible grounds for taking the theory\nseriously. (Possible defeaters might include internal inconsistency,\ninconsistency with accepted theory, or the existence of a (clearly\nsuperior) rival analogical argument.) The point is that Campbell,\nfollowing the lead of 19th century philosopher-scientists\nsuch as Herschel and Whewell, thinks that analogies can establish this\nsort of prima facie plausibility. Snyder (2006) provides a\ndetailed discussion of the latter two thinkers and their ideas about\nthe role of analogies in science.\n\nIn general, analogical arguments may be directed at establishing\neither sort of plausibility for their conclusions; they can have a\nprobabilistic use or a modal use.\n Examples 7\n through\n 9\n are best interpreted as supporting modal conclusions. In those\narguments, an analogy is used to show that a conjecture is worth\ntaking seriously. To insist on putting the conclusion in probabilistic\nterms distracts attention from the point of the argument. The\nconclusion might be modeled (by a Bayesian) as having a certain\nprobability value because it is deemed prima facie\nplausible, but not vice versa.\n Example 2,\n perhaps, might be regarded as directed primarily towards a\nprobabilistic conclusion.\n\nThere should be connections between the two conceptions. Indeed, we\nmight think that the same analogical argument can establish both\nprima facie plausibility and a degree of probability for a\nhypothesis. But it is difficult to translate between epistemic modal\nconcepts and probabilities (Cohen 1980; Douven and Williamson 2006;\nHuber 2009; Spohn 2009, 2012). We cannot simply take the probabilistic\nnotion as the primitive one. It seems wise to keep the two conceptions\nof plausibility separate.\n",
