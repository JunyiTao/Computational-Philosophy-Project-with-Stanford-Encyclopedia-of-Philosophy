Authenticity and Chronology\n\nIn the more exuberantly speculative days of the 19th century, the\nauthenticity of the Laws was rejected by various figures:\neven the great Platonist, Ast, held that \u201cOne who knows the true\nPlato needs only to read a single page of the Laws in order\nto convince himself that it is a fraudulent Plato that he has before\n him.\u201d[1]\n Such skepticism is hard to understand, especially since Aristotle\nrefers to the Laws as a dialogue of Plato\u2019s in numerous\npassages and today no serious scholar doubts its authenticity.\n\nOn the question of chronology, two external references are\nhelpful:\n\nAristotle tells us that the Laws is later than the\nRepublic, (Pol. 2.6) and\nDiogenes Laertius (3.37) reports that it was unfinished at\nPlato\u2019s death (and the text of the Laws itself shows\nsome signs of incompleteness and lack of\n revision).[2]\n\n\nPlatonic scholars also frequently appeal to stylometry (that is, the\nquantitative study of the features of Plato\u2019s prose style) to\nhelp to date the dialogues. Although the usefulness of stylometry is\nsometimes questioned, it is widely accepted and the agreement of many\nsuch studies allows us to divide the dialogues, with some confidence,\ninto three\n groups.[3]\n\nGroup 3: Critias, Laws, Philebus,\nSophist, Statesman, and Timaeus\n\nGroup 2: Parmenides, Phaedrus, Republic,\nand Theaetetus\n\nGroup 1: the rest\n\n\nDrawing upon other evidence, it is reasonable to see the dialogues in\nGroup 3 as the latest. Given the length of the Laws (it is\nthe longest of the dialogues and is, roughly 20% longer than the\nRepublic), it seems likely that its composition overlapped\nwith the composition of at least some of the other dialogues in Group\n3.\n2. Overview\n\nThe Laws comprises a conversation in 12 books, set on Crete,\namong three interlocutors: an unnamed Athenian Visitor (Plato\u2019s\nspokesman in the Laws), Megillus, a Spartan, and Kleinias, a\nCretan. The Athenian proposes that the three discuss governance and\nlaws as they walk along the long road to the temple of Zeus. The first\ntwo books of the dialogue consider the proper goal or end\n(telos) of legislation, which turns out to be the virtue of\nthe citizens. They also contain discussion of topics, such as ethical\npsychology and education, which will help them to understand how a\ncity could achieve this goal. The third book turns to a discussion of\nthe origins of political systems (politeia) and of changes in\nthose political systems, and attempts to draw lessons for the lawmaker\nfrom the histories of various actual states, including Persia, Sparta,\nCrete, and Athens. At the end of Book 3 (Laws\n702B4\u2013D5), Kleinias reveals that he has a practical use for just\nthe kinds of discussions they\u2019ve been having: the cities of\nCrete have decided to found a new city, to be named Magnesia, in a\nlong abandoned part of Crete, and he, along with nine others, is to be\nresponsible for doing so. He asks the Athenian to help in the\nconstruction of the new city\u2019s constitution and laws. The\nAthenian agrees, and proposes that they use a new method of law-giving\n\u2013 one in which preludes which aim at persuading the citizens\ncome before the laws themselves. Books 4\u20135 contain an argument\nfor the use of preludes and the Great Prelude to the laws in general.\nThe Great Prelude to the laws in general ends in the latter part of\nBook 5, after which the Athenian proceeds to sketch, often in\nconsiderable detail, the constitution, the political and social\ninstitutions, and the laws of this new city, along with the political\nand ethical principles that justify them.\n\nA brief sketch of the content and structure of the first 5 books of\nthe Laws follows. From that point on (after the end of the\nGreat Prelude), we will organize our discussion topically rather than\ngoing book by book.\nBook 1\n\nThe dialogue begins with an investigation into the reasons for the\nlaws and social practices of Sparta and Crete. The Athenian argues\nthat laws ought to be justified not by reference to war \u2013 which\nis how both Megillus and Kleinias first attempt to justify the laws of\ntheir own cities \u2013 but rather by reference to what is best,\nwhich is complete virtue (that is, courage, justice, moderation, and\nwisdom, rather than courage alone). In fact, the Athenian says that\nthe complete virtue of the citizens as a whole should be the single\ngoal of the lawgiver (Laws 630C3\u20136; see also e.g.,\n705D3\u2013706A4,\n 963A).[4]\n The Athenian also tells us that laws are true laws insofar as they\npromote the happiness (eudaimonia) of the citizens\n(Laws 631B; see also 715B, 743C\u2013D). Immediately after\nhe first makes this latter claim, he draws a distinction between human\nand divine goods and tells us that the human goods \u2013 like wealth\nand health \u2013 are dependent upon the divine goods, of which\nwisdom is first, then moderation, then justice, and finally courage;\nhe later describes this dependency by saying that the human goods are\ngood for someone who is virtuous but bad for bad men (Laws\n661B\u2013C). The dependency thesis helps Plato bring together the\ntwo characterizations of the goal of the laws in terms of the\ncitizens\u2019 virtue and happiness, respectively: if virtue is\nnecessary for benefit and thus for happiness, promoting the happiness\nof the citizens will require making them virtuous. This dependency\nthesis, as well as the dual characterization of the goal of the laws,\nraises but leaves unanswered questions about the precise relation\nbetween virtue and happiness, however: for example, is virtue actually\nsufficient for happiness, or is it simply\n necessary?[5]\n\nThe remainder of Book 1 is concerned with ethical psychology and\neducation: that is, with beginning the project of showing how a city\ncould produce citizens who possess complete virtue. This discussion\nheavily emphasizes the importance of feeling pleasure and pain\ncorrectly; the Athenian, in fact, claims that \u201c[For] human\nbeings who inquire into laws almost their entire inquiry concerns\npleasures and pains, in cities and in private dispositions. These two\nsprings flow forth by nature, and he who draws from the right one, at\nthe right time, and in the right amount is happy.\u201d\n(Laws 636D5\u2013E1). This phase of the discussion begins\nwith the Athenian announcing his intention to discuss the institutions\nwhich promote courage, which he swiftly notes should cover the ability\nto resist pleasure in addition to the ability to resist pain. He\nproposes controlled symposia (drinking parties) as the institution\nwhich will train this ability to resist pleasure, to the surprise of\nhis interlocutors. As this sort of training will serve as an important\npart of ethical education, this suggestion leads the Athenian to\ndiscuss education in general. Education involves the direction of a\nchild\u2019s pleasures, desires, and love towards his adult\noccupation; in the case of the citizens, education must draw their\nsouls to a desire and love of being a perfect citizen who rules and is\nruled in accordance with justice (Laws 643C\u2013D).\nPleasure is clearly central to the account of ethical psychology and\neducation in the Laws, and one important question to ask of\nthe Laws is why this is so. Is coming to have the correct\npleasures simply of instrumental value (insofar as it blocks one route\nto akratic action and vice or focuses the child on the things which he\nmust come to find valuable), or are at least some of these pleasures\ngood in their own right, e.g. in virtue of their\n contents?[6]\n\nThe discussion of Book 1 closes with a model of the soul which, the\nAthenian says, will make it clearer what virtue and vice are, and will\nhelp us to understand what effects various sorts of educational\npractices, such as the symposia, should be expected to have on the\nhuman soul (Laws\n 645C).[7]\n The model is one of a puppet\n (thauma)[8]\n made by the gods, possessing three cords, two, hard and iron,\nrepresenting the expectations of pleasure and pain, and one, soft and\ngold, representing reason or calculation (Laws 644D). This\nmodel differs in noteworthy ways from the image of the soul as\ncomposed of a human, a lion, and a hydra-headed beast in the\nRepublic and the charioteer and two horses of the\n Phaedrus.[9]\n The three elements in the puppet image are affections rather\nthan possessors of affections; and the most important\ndivision here is between the two iron cords and the golden cord, with\nno fundamental difference (of the sort that we see when spirit is\ncalled reason\u2019s natural ally in the Republic) between\nthe two iron cords. How to explain the differences in the model of the\nsoul that we get here from the ones we get in other dialogues is\nanother important question for interpreters of the\n Laws.[10]\nBook 2\n\nBook 2 begins by returning to the definition of education; the\nAthenian here tells us that education consists in training a child to\nfeel pleasure and pain, and to love and hate, correctly, before he can\nunderstand the reason why (Laws 653B\u2013C). Education in\nmusic and gymnastics is particularly crucial for the project of\nethical education. The Athenian tells us that young children naturally\ndesire to move and to make noise, and are naturally capable of taking\npleasure in order in movement and sound (Laws\n653D\u2013654A); one explanation for the centrality of music and\ngymnastics in the educational program, then, could appeal to the role\nof music and gymnastics in training this capacity to perceive and take\npleasure in\n order.[11]\n Book 2 focuses primarily on musical education and the standard of\ncorrectness in music; Book 7 returns to the topic of education in\ngymnastics, and lays out the rest of the educational program. These\ntopics will be discussed further in section 7 of this article (Poetry\nand Education).\n\nPart of the discussion of poetry in Book 2 deals with its content. The\nAthenian praises the Spartans and the Cretans for compelling poets to\nteach that the good man is happy and for giving no attention to the\nbad man; he also asserts that the poet ought also to teach that human\ngoods are dependent upon virtue and that the most pleasant life, the\nmost just life, and the happiest (most eudaim\u00f4n) life\ncoincide (Laws 662C\u2013E). This latter doctrine has great\nsignificance given that, as the Athenian says next, no man will\nvoluntarily do anything unless it involves more pleasure than pain;\nthis passage has also been thought to provide evidence that Plato\nremains a rational eudaimonist in the\n Laws.[12]\n The Athenian tells us that the views that the poet is to be compelled\nto espouse are both most true and most useful for persuading the\ncitizens to live virtuously (Laws 664C).\nBook 3\n\nBook 3 abruptly moves to a discussion of the origin of government,\nbeginning from the disorganized condition in which human beings would\nhave been left after one of the great catastrophes which the Athenian\ntakes to have destroyed human society over and over again. After\ndescribing how cities would have first come about out of this\ndisorder, the Athenian turns to the discussion of the histories of\nactual states. He first focuses on the histories of Sparta, Argos, and\nMessene, with particular attention to the features of the Spartan\nconstitution which saved it from the corruption which afflicted its\nneighbors. This discussion highlights the destructive power of\nignorance about what is to be valued (Laws 688C) and the\ndanger of entrusting too much power to a single, corruptible,\nindividual (Laws 691C\u2013D). The Athenian then turns to a\ndiscussion of Persia and Athens. The Athenian begins this discussion\nby reminding us that a lawgiver ought to aim at his city\u2019s being\nfree, wise, and a friend to itself (Laws 693B). He then\nclaims that there are two forms of constitution from which the rest\nare derived, monarchy and democracy, and attempts to show the virtues\nof the moderate forms, and the vices of the extreme forms, of each\nconstitution by considering Persia\u2019s development from a moderate\nto an extreme monarchy and Athens\u2019s development from a moderate\nto an extreme democracy. The moral of this discussion is that only a\nmixture of monarchy and democracy can allow a state to be both wise\nand free (Laws 693E) \u2013 a state which is strikingly\ncharacterized in the case of the earlier, more moderate form of\nAthenian democracy, as voluntary slavery to the laws (Laws\n 700A).[13]\n After this discussion has been completed, Kleinias announces that the\ndiscussion has had a practical point: he, along with nine others, is\nto craft laws for a new Cretan colony. He asks for the help of the\nAthenian and Megillus in building up the laws and institutions of this\nnew state, which is the project of the rest of the Laws.\nBook 4\n\nBook 4 opens with a discussion of the way in which the geographical\nlocation and features of the proposed city of Magnesia affect the ease\nor difficulty of creating a virtuous city. It then turns to consider\nthe method of settlement of the proposed city, and the practical\nchallenges of forming a group of settlers (whether they be from one or\nmany states) into a genuinely new society. Here, the Athenian suggests\nthat the easiest way to form new and good institutions in a society is\nfor it to be blessed with a good tyrant who wishes to create\ninstitutions conducing to virtue. The Athenian moves on to ask what\ntype of polity they ought to form; he answers by saying that the best\nruler a city can have is god, and that they ought to imitate the rule\nof god by ordering their city in obedience to reason, the immortal\nelement within themselves. These regulations set down by reason are to\nbe called law (Laws\n 714A).[14]\n\nThe Athenian then imagines their address to the new settlers. He\nbegins by emphasizing the power of god over human affairs and suggests\nthat each man ought therefore to become dear to god. The way to do\nthis, he says, is to come to be like god, i.e. to become virtuous\n(Laws 716A\u2013E). After discussing the worship of the gods\nand the veneration of parents, the Athenian pauses to reflect on the\nway in which the laws that he is beginning to describe are to make the\ncity happy (Laws 718B). He distinguishes between two methods\nof law-giving, one appropriate to free men and another to slaves,\nillustrating this by means of a distinction between a slave doctor who\nsimply prescribes what he thinks to be right to each of his patients,\nand a free doctor who investigates the ailment with his patient and\ninstructs him as to the nature of his disease as much as possible,\nprescribing a treatment only with the patient\u2019s consent\n(Laws 720A\u2013720E). The analogous method in the case of\nlaw-giving, the Athenian tells us, is to offer preludes to the laws\nthat aim at persuasion, and it is this method that he proposes to\nfollow in establishing the laws of Magnesia, condemning the\nalternative as the employment of mere force (Laws\n722B\u2013C). After illustrating this \u2018double method\u2019 in\nthe case of marriage laws, the three decide to proceed systematically\nfor the rest of the dialogue, giving first the preludes and then the\nlaws. Issues connected with the preludes will be discussed in greater\ndetail in section 5 (Preludes in the Laws).\nBook 5\n\nBook 5 continues the Great Prelude to the laws in general which\nstarted with the discussion of gods and ancestors in Book 4. The\nAthenian begins this next phase of the address by telling the citizens\nthat they ought to honor their souls above all their other\npossessions, as their souls are both most their own and the most\ndivine of all their possessions. To honor one\u2019s soul, he tells\nthem, is to follow virtue and, in general, good things, rather than to\nallow it to satisfy any desires and to enjoy any pleasures it might\nwant; and, at the end of the discussion, this ability of the soul to\nfollow the good is identified as that which explains why the soul is\nto be so highly honored. Next on the list comes the body, which ought\nto be honored by being put in a moderate state, as that is what best\nsupports the good state of the soul; third are money and property,\nwhich also ought to be held in moderation, for the same reason. After\na very brief discussion of relations with friends and strangers, the\nAthenian turns to the character of the person who leads the finest or\nmost noble (kallista) life. There, he describes various\npraiseworthy or blameworthy traits of character, before giving a\ngeneral warning to all citizens to avoid excessive self-love as\n\u201cthe greatest of all evils\u201d and \u201cthe cause of all of\neach man\u2019s wrongdoings on every occasion\u201d (Laws\n731D6\u2013E5). Instead, he encourages each citizen to love not\nhimself or his own possessions but rather what is just, whether it\nbelongs to himself or to someone else. This claim will be discussed\nfurther in section 9 (Ethics).\n\nThe prelude then moves from the \u201cdivine things\u201d with which\nit has been occupied to the \u201chuman things\u201d, chief among\nthem pleasure and pain, explaining that \u201cto these every mortal\nanimal is, as it were, inextricably attached and bound in the most\nserious ways\u201d (Laws 732E5\u20137). The Athenian then\nsets out the types of pleasures and pains which characterizes moderate\nand immoderate lives, with the aim of arguing that those which\ncharacterize the moderate life should be preferred and thus that the\nlife of virtue is the most pleasant life. This ends the Great Prelude\nto the laws in general, and the Athenian announces that they must now\nsketch the organization of the state (Laws 734E). The rest of\nBook 5 is concerned primarily with the citizens\u2019 properties\n\u2013 the number of households there shall be, the degree of\nvariance in wealth that the citizens shall be allowed to attain, and\nthe way that the citizens should engage with money \u2013 and with\njustifying those precepts with reference to the citizens\u2019\nhappiness. The rest of the Laws continues to describe and to\njustify the organization and the laws of this new city.\n3. The Laws\u2019 Relation to the Republic\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, the Laws undertakes to create a good\ncity and to discuss political theory, ethics, psychology, and other\ntopics relevant to the creation of such a city. This makes it very\nnatural to ask what the relation between the Laws and the\nRepublic is. The predominant view, until fairly recently,\nholds that the Republic is Plato\u2019s statement of what\nthe ideally best city is; the Laws, on the other hand,\ndescribes the city that would be best, given less optimistic\nassumptions about what human nature is capable of. This position has\ntwo variants, depending on one\u2019s view of whether Plato at the\ntime of the Republic thought that its political program was\ncompatible with human nature. If one thinks that even at the time of\nthe Republic, Plato thought that its ideal city placed too\ngreat demands on its citizens to be psychologically realizable, then\none can hold that the Laws is entirely consistent with the\nRepublic: they could, at least as far as their philosophical\npositions are concerned, have been written at the same\n time.[15]\n If, on the other hand, one thinks that Plato held that the city of\nthe Republic was psychologically possible, even if difficult\nto realize, it is natural to see the Laws as the outcome of a\nchange in Plato\u2019s views about human\n nature.[16]\n The first view faces two challenges:\n\nproviding evidence from the Republic that Plato did not\nthink its ideal city was realizable, and\neither explaining why the Republic does not at least\ngesture in the direction of the arrangements of the Laws as\nthe best humanly possible option or arguing that we can find such\nevidence.\n\n\nThe second view should explain why Plato becomes more pessimistic\nabout human nature. The need for such an explanation is especially\npressing, since the most common attempt to do so by appealing to\nPlato\u2019s experiences in Sicily is philosophically quite\n unsatisfactory.[17]\n\nIn recent years, it has been argued that there are deep and pervasive\ndifferences between the Republic and the Laws (and\nmore generally between the dialogues of Group 3 and those of Group 2)\non ethical and political\n questions.[18]\n The debate over these claims is just in its initial stages and no\nscholarly consensus has yet emerged. Among other topics relevant to\nthe interpretation of the Laws, this entry sketches a few\nimportant topics of contemporary controversy and then points to lines\nof future research. To begin, perhaps the most important passage in\nthe Laws directly bearing on its relation to the\nRepublic comes in Book 5. There, in what is nowadays perhaps\nthe most famous passage in the Laws, the Athenian announces\nthat they are to engage in the construction of a\n\u201csecond-best\u201d city.\n\nAnyone who uses reason and experience will recognize that a\nsecond-best city [deuter\u00f4s \u2026 pros to beltiston]\nis to be constructed \u2026 That city and that constitution are\nfirst, and the laws are best, where the old proverb holds as much as\npossible throughout the whole city: it is said that the things of\nfriends really are in common. (Laws 739A3\u2013740C3)\n\n\nThe traditional assumption is that Plato here endorses the city\nsketched in the Republic as the best possible city, but now\nthinks that the demands it places on its inhabitants are too high: the\ncity in the Laws is the second-best, but is the best that is\nlikely to be compatible with human nature. It is also sometimes\nthought to follow from this that Plato still endorses the basic\nelements of the Republic\u2019s political and ethical\ntheory.\n\nBut such an interpretation misreads the passage. Even if Plato were to\nendorse the political arrangements of the Republic as the\nbest possible ones, it would not follow that he also endorses all the\nclaims concerning political theory made in the Republic, much\nless that he endorses all of the Republic\u2019s claims in\nethics, psychology and epistemology. The political arrangements of the\nRepublic are entailed by, and are consistent with, many\ndifferent sets of premises, some of which are mutually inconsistent.\nNor does the present passage endorse all of the political structures\nof the Republic, rather it endorses the community of\nproperty, women and children and the goal of making the city as\nunified as possible. But what is most important is that this passage\ndoes not in fact endorse the Republic\u2019s method for\nmaking the city one by introducing a certain kind of community of\nproperty and families. In the Republic, these institutions\nare restricted to the first two classes, but are rejected for the\nthird class, the producers. The Laws passage presents as the\n\u201cfirst-best\u201d city, not that of the Republic, but\none in which there is, throughout the entire city, a community of\nproperty and of women and children. So the claim that the city\nsketched in the Laws is second-best does not suggest that the\nRepublic still represents Plato\u2019s ideal political\n arrangement.[19]\n What the Laws represents as the ideal \u2013 that is to be\napproximated as closely as possible \u2013 is a city in which all\ncitizens are subject to the same extremely high ethical demands.\n4. The Social and Political Institutions of Magnesia\n\nThis section provides a brief overview of the basic social and\npolitical institutions of Magnesia. Magnesia will be located in a part\nof Crete that has been left empty by an ancient migration and is about\nten miles from the sea. The site is basically self-sufficient in\nresources without having much excess to export. Plato sees this\nunsuitability for active commerce and distance from the sea as\nadvantages: they discourage the maritime and commercial activities\nthat corrupt cities by fostering a love of money-making in the\ncitizens and by allowing close contact with foreigners who bring\ninnovation and have not received the good ethical education afforded\nto Magnesians.\n\nThe city will be relatively populous: its number of households is to\nremain permanently at\n 5,040.[20]\n Immigration and emigration policies are designed to avoid population\nexcess and deficiency. Each household will have an allotment\nconsisting of two plots of land: one nearer the city\u2019s center\nand one nearer its borders. Each household\u2019s allotment is\nintended to be equally productive (Laws 737CE, 745CD) and to\nsupport a comfortable, although not luxurious, life for the\nhousehold\u2019s members. The households and land are not owned or\nfarmed in common, but each shareholder must consider his share to be\nat the same time the common property of the whole city (Laws\n740A3\u20136). Part of the sense in which the lot is in common is\nthat it is inalienable and cannot be divided or aggregated: the\nassignment of the lot to a household is intended to support the\nhousehold throughout the generations. (There are also restrictions on\nthe use of the\n land.[21]\n ) Further, each household will help, out of its own resources, to\nfund Magnesia\u2019s system of common\n meals.[22]\n Plato establishes four property classes: the members of the top or\nfirst class have assets worth between three and four times the value\nof the lot (and the tools and animals needed to farm it), the second\nclass between two and three times this value and so\n on.[23]\n Anything accumulated over the highest amount will be confiscated by\nthe city (Laws 744D\u2013745A). Such assets do not include\ngold and silver, since these may be possessed only by the city; there\nwill be only a token currency (Laws\n 742AB).[24]\n\nMany of Magnesia\u2019s inhabitants are not citizens. There is a\nconsiderable slave population (including both public and private\nslaves) and they, of course, are not citizens. Also found within the\ncity are transient foreigners and resident foreigners (metics) who may\nstay for twenty years. Slaves and foreigners are an economic necessity\nfor the city for they will carry on the trading, manufacturing and\nmenial occupations that are barred to citizens. The lot holders or\nheads of households are citizens, but citizenship is not restricted to\nthem and owning land is not a necessary condition of citizenship. The\nsons and heirs of lot holders are called \u201ccitizens\u201d and\nare liable to military service at age 20, can participate in elections\nat that age and can serve in office at\n 30.[25]\n They will not inherit the household lot, however, until their father\ndies. What of women? In Magnesia, the private family is not abolished.\nAlthough women lack an independent right to own property, they are\nliable to military training and service and attend their own common\nmeals (Laws 780D). The Athenian holds that they can attain\nthe four cardinal virtues and for this reason requires that they be\neducated (Laws 804D\u2013805A). For Aristotle, women are not\ncitizens of the ideal city, since they are excluded from political\noffice. But in Magnesia, women can participate in elections and hold\npolitical office and the Athenian explicitly counts them as citizens\n(Laws\n 814C2\u20134).[26]\n\nLet us turn to the political system or constitution\n(politeia) of Magnesia. Magnesia has a rich variety of\noffices, but the main ones are: the Assembly (koinos\nsullogos, ekkl\u00easia), the Council\n(boul\u00ea), the magistrates, especially the guardians of\nthe laws (nomophulakes), the courts and the Nocturnal Council\n(nukterinos sullogos). The Nocturnal Council is discussed in\nmore detail below in section 6.\n\nThe Assembly is the main electoral authority in the city; it is\ncomposed of all citizens, or more precisely, all those who have served\nor are serving in the military. The Assembly is responsible for the\nelection of most of the city\u2019s officers and magistrates. The\nother functions explicitly given to it are\n\na role in judging offenses against the public,\nmaking awards of merit,\nextending the term of residence for metics, and\npassing on proposed changes in the laws, at least those regarding\ndances and sacrifices.\n\n\nIt may also have other responsibilities in connection with foreign\n affairs.[27]\n\nThe Council is composed of 90 members chosen by election from each\nproperty class for a total of 360 members. Men are eligible for office\nat age 30, women at age 40. Members serve one-year terms. The Council\nexercises ordinary administrative powers, such as calling and\ndissolving the Assembly, receiving foreign ambassadors, supervising\nelections and so on.\n\nThe guardians of the laws (nomophulakes) are composed of 37\ncitizens, at least fifty years of age who serve from the time of their\nelection until age 70 (Laws 755A). There are four ways in\nwhich the nomophulakes guard the\n laws:[28]\n\nAlthough they do not seem to have the authority to discipline\nother magistrates, they are assigned the general task of supervising\nthem and are expected to bring appropriate cases to the attention of\nthe proper officials.\nThey exercise wide supervisory powers over citizens in general\nand, for example, are charged with fining those who spend excessively,\ngranting permission to travel abroad and overseeing the care of\norphans.\nThey possess various judicial functions and are in charge of\nespecially important or difficult cases involving the family, property\nand the abuse of laws.\nPerhaps their most important task is the revision and\nsupplementation of the existing laws, although the extent of revision\npossible is\n controversial.[29]\n\n\nFinally, there is an extensive system of courts in Magnesia, both\npublic and private. One of Plato\u2019s major innovations, compared\nwith Athenian law, is the elaborate structure of appeals in judicial\ncases. It is worth noting that Plato holds that citizens, in virtue of\ntheir standing in the political community, may legitimately expect to\nhave a share in the administration of justice (Laws\n767E9\u2013768B3).\n5. Preludes in the Laws\n\nA significant part of the impetus for interpretations that see\nconsiderable differences between the Republic and the\nLaws comes from the presence in the latter of\n\u201cpreludes\u201d to individual laws and to the lawcode as a\nwhole that are available to all the citizens. In Plato\u2019s own\nview, one of the most important innovations in the political theory of\nthe Laws is the requirement that good lawgivers try to persuade the\ncitizens and not simply issue commands to them by means of laws\n(Laws 722B5\u2013C2). Plato compares the lawgiver in\nMagnesia to a free doctor treating free people. Slave doctors who\ntreat other slaves merely give them orders and then rush off to other\npatients. Free doctors treating free people must explain to their\npatients the condition they have and the rationale for treatment\nbefore prescribing (Laws 722B\u2013723B). In doing so, they\nwill \u201ceducate\u201d the patients and use \u201carguments that\ncome close to philosophizing\u201d (Laws 857C2\u2013E5).\nSimilarly, Plato thinks that the lawgiver in Magnesia should not\nmerely issue legal commands: law without persuasion is condemned as\nmere force (722B). Drawing on Plato\u2019s programmatic remarks in\nBooks 4, 9, and 10 the preludes should have the following\nfeatures.\n\nWhat the person who is to be persuaded is asking for is to be\n\u201ceducated\u201d or \u201ctaught,\u201d that is, to be given\ngood epistemic reasons for thinking that the principles lying behind\nthe legislation are true (Laws 885DE).\nWhat the lawgiver and the preludes actually do is characterized as\n\u201cteaching,\u201d that is, giving reasons to the citizens and\nbringing it about that they \u201clearn\u201d (Laws 718CD,\n720D, 723A, 857DE and 888A).\nThe preludes are thus designed to be instances of rational\npersuasion, that is, attempts to influence the citizens\u2019 beliefs\nby appealing to rational considerations. They are not intended to\ninculcate false, but useful beliefs, or to effect persuasion through\nnon-rational means.\nThe preludes are meant to provide quite general ethical\ninstruction. The lawgiver is to be a primary source of instruction\nabout what is fine, just and good. Thus the citizens will learn why\nthe laws are fine and just and should also learn why following the\nlaws and, more generally, acting virtuously is good for them. They are\nto receive a true and reasoned account of what is good for human\nbeings.\n\n\nThe view that this use of preludes marks a significant difference from\nthe Republic depends on two claims.\n\nThe Laws advocates the use of preludes, along with other\nmethods, to educate the citizens and give them some rational\nunderstanding of the laws and, more generally, an understanding of\nethical truths.\nThe Republic does not intend to provide, except to its\nhighest class, the philosopher-rulers, an education that can result in\nsuch a rational appreciation of basic ethical truths.\n\n\nWith respect to (II), advocates of the change interpretation point to\npassages from the Republic such as the following.\n\nTherefore, to insure that someone like that [one whose reason is not\nstrong enough to rule himself] is ruled by something similar to what\nrules the best person, we say that he ought to be the slave\n[doulon] of that best person who has a divine ruler within\nhimself. (Rep. 590C8\u2013D1)\n\n\nThe education provided to the two lower classes, it is argued, thus\ndoes not succeed in enabling them to be ruled by their own reason and\nleaves them in the state of slaves. In Republic Book 7, Plato\nconsiders whether the musical education the auxiliaries receive (which\nis the most advanced education that they get) tends to the good of\nleading the soul out of the Cave and toward the\n\u201cintelligible\u201d or \u201cknowable region.\u201d The\nanswer is that it does not, since musical education\n\neducated the guardians through habits. Its harmonies gave them a\ncertain harmoniousness, not knowledge; its rhythms gave them a certain\nrhythmical quality; and its stories whether fictional or nearer the\ntruth, cultivated other habits akin to these. But there was nothing in\nit that aimed at any such subject as you are now seeking.\n(Rep. 522A4\u2013B1, cf. 484C3\u2013D10 and\n516E8\u2013517E2)\n\n\nThus all citizens, other than the philosopher-rulers, remain within\nthe Cave.\n\nBoth (I) and (II) are, however, quite controversial. With respect to\n(I), some have argued that despite the fact that Plato\u2019s\nprogrammatic remarks about the preludes suggest that they are designed\nto further a rational appreciation of ethical truths, what is actually\nprovided for the vast majority of the citizens is, primarily,\nrhetorical persuasion appealing to their sense of honor and shame.\nThis gap is then explained either by the hypothesis (i) that Plato is\nbeing deceptive, or his mental capacities declined in old age; or (ii)\nthat the programmatic remarks represent an ideal that Plato makes it\nclear cannot be realized in actual\n practice.[30]\n Evaluating the acceptability of (II) will require careful examination\nof the education provided to the Republic\u2019s auxiliary\nand money-making classes and, in particular, consideration of what the\nauxiliaries\u2019 \u201cmusical education\u201d provides them\n with.[31]\n\nInterpretations that see the main aim of the preludes as providing,\nalong with the rest of the citizens\u2019 education, a rational,\nalthough less than fully philosophic, grasp of basic ethical\nprinciples need not hold that this is the only aim of the preludes or\nthat there is only one kind of prelude. Plato does include some\npreludes \u2013 e.g. those to laws pertaining to murders that are\nespecially heinous in that they are fully voluntary and committed out\nof desire for pleasure, envy and so on \u2013 that work primarily by\nrhetorical means or appeal to myths that Plato probably did not accept\nas literally true (e.g. 870D\u2013871A). Such preludes are designed,\nas Saunders notes, for those citizens who have badly failed to benefit\nfrom Magnesia\u2019s educational system (Saunders 1992,\n210\u201311). Such preludes are a last resort before the infliction\nof punishment and are aimed at the inevitable failures among the\ncitizens. Interpretations stressing the rational aim of the preludes\nargue that Magnesia\u2019s education is intended to give the citizens\nas a whole the ability to follow the more sophisticated preludes and\nthat such preludes are not restricted to an elite sub-class of\ncitizens.\n\nFurther progress in resolving these disputes might be made by\ncontinued research on three topics. First, we must consider the\npreludes in light of the broader context of the citizens\u2019\neducation in the Laws. What sort of education is provided for\nthem and what cognitive and ethical abilities will such education\nfoster? Second, we need to examine Plato\u2019s views about education\nin the other late dialogues, especially the\n Statesman.[32]\n Finally, the issues concerning citizens\u2019 education are\nintimately linked to deep questions in Plato\u2019s psychology and\nepistemology. In order to understand what kind of education is\nrequired in order to have a rational grasp of ethical principles we\nmust consider the nature of ethical learning, given Plato\u2019s\nepistemology and psychology, in both the middle and late periods. This\nissue is discussed a bit further in section 10.\n6. The Nocturnal Council and Political Participation\n\nA second, more longstanding, controversy about the Laws\nconcerns the role of the body known as the \u201cNocturnal\nCouncil\u201d which is so-called because it meets daily from dawn\nuntil sunrise when everyone has the most leisure from public and\nprivate activities (Laws\n 961B6\u20138).[33]\n The Nocturnal Council is first explicitly mentioned in Book 10 (but\nis alluded to earlier at Laws 632C4\u20136 and\n818A1\u20133) where it is assigned an educational function. Those who\nhave violated Magnesia\u2019s impiety laws due to ignorance, rather\nthan bad character, are to be imprisoned for five years. During their\nimprisonment, the members of the Nocturnal Council meet with them in\norder to reform their beliefs by teaching (Laws 909A). The\nNocturnal Council\u2019s membership seems to include:\n\nthe 10 oldest guardians of the laws,\nthe current supervisor of education and his predecessors,\nexaminers (officials who check the qualifications of those\nentering office and audit them when they leave office) and other\ncitizens who have won awards of honor,\ncertain citizens who have traveled abroad under official auspices\nto gather knowledge and have been invited to participate by the\nNocturnal Council itself, and\neach of the above members is to nominate for membership (whose\nacceptance is subject to the approval of the other members) a younger\nassociate between the ages of 30 and 40 (Laws 951D4\u2013E5\nand 961A1\u2013B6).\n\n\nIn Book 12, the Athenian returns to the Nocturnal Council and\nemphasizes its great importance for the city. The following passage\nfrom Book 12 has encouraged some to think that Plato here grants the\nNocturnal Council very great, or even unlimited, political power.\n\nIf this divine council should come into being for us, dear friends,\nthe city ought to be handed over to it [paradoteon tout\u00f4i\nt\u00ean polin] (Laws 969B2\u20133, cf.\n960B5\u2013E11 and 961C3\u20136)\n\n\nSome scholars have held, on the basis of these passages, that Plato\nintends the Nocturnal Council to be the main political authority in\nMagnesia. On this view, either it will have the same powers as did the\nphilosopher kings in the Republic to change laws and\ninstitutions as it sees fit or the extent of its powers will simply be\nleft to the Nocturnal Council itself to\n determine.[34]\n Such an interpretation has, however, quite high costs. As its main\ncontemporary proponent concedes, it requires us to see the\nLaws as inconsistent: the earlier provisions of political\nauthority to various offices are incompatible with assigning such\nunlimited powers to the Nocturnal\n Council.[35]\n Further, such a grant of power is at least in serious tension with\none of the Laws\u2019 basic political principles. Repeatedly\nin the Laws, Plato emphasizes that allowing any magistrate or\npolitical body unchecked authority runs too great a risk of the abuse\nof power. Such a risk is still too great even if the possessors of\npower have genuine knowledge: even those with full knowledge are\nsubject to corruption in such\n circumstances.[36]\n\nOther interpreters, such as Glenn Morrow, have suggested that the\nNocturnal Council\u2019s role is primarily\n informal.[37]\n This Council is to possess various sorts of knowledge and it must\nalso educate its own members. Even without possessing powers beyond\nthose explicitly assigned to it, the Nocturnal Council should exercise\na considerable influence on Magnesia\u2019s governance. Its members\ninclude some of the city\u2019s most important officials. Plato would\ncertainly expect that these officials\u2019 administration of the\nlaws and revision of them \u2013 if this is permitted \u2013 will be\ninformed by their studies. Perhaps even more important, the younger\nassociate members of the Nocturnal Council will come to fill many\noffices of the state and will exercise an informal, but still\nsignificant, influence on other citizens in the deliberations that\nplay such an important role in Magnesia\u2019s system of government,\nas well as in their other contacts with their fellows.\n\nThere is, however, a third option. Morrow adopts his\n\u201cinformal\u201d interpretation in part because Plato does not\nexplicitly assign to the Nocturnal Council any powers beyond those we\nhave noted. But one could hold that the Laws is not intended\nto provide a fully determinate blueprint of the just\n city.[38]\n On this interpretation, there is an open texture to the political and\nsocial institutions that Plato sketches and we should allow for a\nrange of ways of implementing the basic structure. For example, Plato\nappears to assign to the \u201cguardians of the laws\u201d (the\nnomophulakes) some important role in revising Magnesia\u2019s laws.\nIn his Book 12 discussion, Plato describes the members of the\nNocturnal Council as \u201cthose who will really be guardians of the\nlaws\u201d (Laws 966B5). The members of the Nocturnal\nCouncil will, if properly educated, be \u201cmade into guardians\nwhose like, with respect to the virtue of safekeeping, we have not\nseen come into being in our lives previously\u201d (Laws\n969C2\u20133). We need not see these claims as a volte-face on\nPlato\u2019s part, if we allow for a range of ways in which the\noutline of Magnesia sketched can be realized that fall between\nexcluding the Nocturnal Council from any political role at all and\nseeing them as philosopher kings in disguise. We can thus allow that\nthe Nocturnal Council is intended to have genuine political authority\ngoing beyond its explicitly stated responsibilities that still falls\nwell short of autocratic power, without expecting the\nLaws\u2019 text to make this authority fully\ndeterminate.\n\nBut in addition to the specific issue of the extent of the Nocturnal\nCouncil\u2019s powers, there is a deeper question. The more political\nauthority that is assigned to the Nocturnal Council, the more\npolitically passive most citizens of Magnesia will be. Thus the\nquestion about the power of the Nocturnal Council has significant\nimplications for our evaluation of the ethical capacities of\nnon-philosophical citizens. If their education really does give them\nsome rational appreciation of the principles underlying the laws of\nMagnesia, we should expect that they can, to a significant degree, be\nfree from detailed regulation and supervision by others. Further, not\nonly is it the case that they will be capable of being free from such\nregulation, but we should expect that deliberating and acting upon\ntheir grasp of ethical principles forms an important part of their own\n good.[39]\n If, however, their political activity is reduced to the level of the\ntwo lower classes in the Republic, who have little or no part\nin political deliberation or judicial administration, we might think\nthat Plato has the same fairly low estimate of the ethical capacities\nof ordinary citizens in both works. Resolving the issue of the\nNocturnal Council\u2019s powers thus has broad implications for our\nunderstanding of Plato\u2019s later ethics.\n7. Poetry and Education\n\nThe goal of the city of the Laws, as we\u2019ve seen, is to\nproduce citizens who possess complete virtue (Laws\n630C3\u20136; see also e.g. 705D3\u2013706A4, 963A). The education\nin virtue of the citizens is, therefore, of central importance for the\nLaws: we are told early on that well-educated men will turn\nout to be good men and thus that it is of great importance for a state\nto educate its citizens well (Laws 641B). This makes the\neducation of the citizens a topic of great importance for interpreters\nof the Laws as well, especially insofar as understanding what\neffect the educational program of Magnesia can be expected to have on\nthe citizens will help us to understand what sort of virtue the\ncitizens can be expected to have.\n\nThe educational program of Magnesia begins with music and gymnastics,\nand Plato emphasizes the deep importance of this part of the\neducational program in various parts of the\n Laws.[40]\n The right nurture of children begins in the womb, and is described as\n\u201cpre-natal gymnastics\u201d: pregnant women are to walk, and,\nlater, nurses are to carry the children, so as to, as much as\npossible, have the children moved as though they were being constantly\nrocked by the sea (Laws 789B\u2013790C). From the ages of\nthree to six children are to play at prescribed games (Laws\n797B; but see also the claim, at 794A, that the games arise from\nnatural instinct). Plato in fact insists that childrens\u2019 games\nare of decisive importance for legislation, as a change in the games\nwill, he thinks, lead to a change in the childrens\u2019 standards\nfor propriety and impropriety; this will, in turn, lead to a change in\ntheir characters and in the laws they desire to be governed\n by.[41]\n At the age of six the sexes are to be divided and lessons in music\nand gymnastics begun. Both music and gymnastics include imitations of\nvirtuous people engaged in virtuous activities or exhibiting virtuous\ntraits, such as fighting courageously or feeling moderate pleasures\n(see e.g. Laws 655A\u2013655E, 660A, 795E\u2013796C, and\n814E\u2013816B); what it is to be well-educated in choristry is to\ndelight in and to hate the imitations that one ought, more so than to\nbe able to execute certain songs and dances skillfully (Laws\n654C\u2013D). This education in music and gymnastics is a lifelong\nprocess: citizens of Magnesia are meant to sing and dance in\nage-specific choruses for the rest of their lives, and are told that\nit is their duty to constantly encourage in themselves an appetite for\nethically improving songs (Laws 665C). The oldest chorus\nmembers participate in symposia in addition to singing, at least in\npart with the goal of making their souls soft and youthful, and thus\nonce again capable of being molded by the legislator (Laws\n671C\u2013D).\n\nIn addition to music and dance, children are given a literary\neducation, are taught to play the lyre, and learn arithmetic,\ngeometry, and astronomy (Laws 809C). The Athenian warns\nagainst having children read the poets, as, he says, each has said\nsome things badly, but declares that the text of the Laws\nitself and whatever other prose, poetry, or speeches should resemble\nit are appropriate for the children to study (Laws\n 811B\u2013E).[42]\n In arithmetic and geometry, the Athenian emphasizes how shameful it\nis for the citizens to be ignorant (as so many Greeks then were) of\nincommensurability (Laws 819E\u2013820D). The situation is\neven worse in astronomy: there, the common belief that the planets\nwander rather than traveling the same circular path is not only\nshameful but also impious, as it is a mistake about the gods\n(Laws 821A\u2013D).\n\nOne striking feature of the educational program in the Laws\nis its emphasis on music and gymnastics, from the very beginning up to\nthe very end of a life. What sort of impact does this type of\neducation have on the soul and how can we explain why it is so central\nto the educational program? In considering these questions, it is\nworth thinking about the educational program in the Republic\nas a contrast case: there the musical education given to the\nauxiliaries is said to be an education through habits which cannot\nproduce genuine virtue (Rep 522A4\u2013B1, cf.\n484C3\u2013D10 and\n 516E8\u2013517E2).[43]\n If we think that Plato wants the educational program of Magnesia to\nproduce something approaching genuine virtue in the citizens, then\nwe\u2019ll need to give an account of how music and dance can do more\nthan produce good habits in the citizens. (This is not to say that\nhabituation does not or cannot play an important role in the\neducational program: see e.g. Laws 656B.)\n\nOne recent\n strategy[44]\n that might explain the centrality given to education in music and\ngymnastics in the Laws begins with the following passage:\n\n[A]lmost without exception, every young creature is incapable of\nkeeping either its body or its tongue quiet, and is always striving to\nmove and to cry, leaping and skipping and delighting in dances and\ngames, and uttering, also, noises of every description. Now, whereas\nother creatures are devoid of any perception of the various kinds of\norder and disorder in movement (which we term rhythm and harmony), to\nus men the very gods, who were given, as we said, to be our fellows in\nthe dance, have granted the pleasurable perception of rhythm and\nharmony, whereby they cause us to move and lead our choirs\u2026\n(Laws 653D7\u2013654A3)\n\nThis passage tells us that human beings are capable of perceiving\norder in sound and motion and that they have natural tendencies\ntowards moving and making noise which provide the opportunity for that\ncapacity to perceive order to be trained. Insofar as good order is\nwhat makes things\n fine,[45]\n then the pleasurable perception of the good order in sound and motion\nwill be a way of appreciating finemaking properties, which could in\nturn help the child to acquire or refine the concepts of fineness and\ngoodness. And if this perception and resulting comprehension of order\nis cognitively continuous with the grip on order that is involved in\ngenuine virtue, then this also helps us show how this education could\nbe part of the acquisition of genuine\n virtue.[46],\n [47]\n\nCitizens of Magnesia, as we\u2019ve seen, also get a sophisticated\neducation in mathematics and astronomy. The particular results that\nthis education aims to impart may be significant. As Ian Mueller has\npointed out, incommensurability is itself a non-sensible property: two\n(physical) lines which represent incommensurable magnitudes will\nnonetheless appear to someone who measures them carefully to be\n commensurable.[48]\n Understanding the fact that there are some incommensurable segments\nthus crucially involves a grip on non-sensible properties, which is\nessential for coming to grasp genuine value\n properties.[49]\n The results aimed at in astronomical education are also significant:\ncircular motion is the motion associated with reason and thus the\ncircular motion of the gods is related to their status as paradigms of\nreason and of goodness.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen, then, that there are robust resources available for\nan interpreter of the Laws to show how the educational system\nof Magnesia could produce something like genuine virtue: their\neducation in music and dance may serve to give students an\nappreciation of order which will help them to grasp value concepts,\nand their mathematical and astronomical education may be designed to\nallow them to articulate those concepts and to see their role in\nstructuring the cosmos. There are, however, also reasons to worry\nabout how robust the virtue established by the educational system of\nMagnesia really is. The lifelong nature of education \u2013 and, in\nparticular, the striking claim that old men must participate in\nsymposia so as to make their souls young and malleable again \u2013\nsuggests that the virtue of the citizens is fragile enough to require\nconstant\n upkeep.[50]\n The way in which we account for what does or can go wrong to make the\ncitizens\u2019 virtue need reinforcement will also help us fix on the\nnature of that reinforcement and thus on the way in which the\neducational system affects the souls of the citizens more generally.\nMore research, then, is needed into the two interrelated questions of\nthe way in which the education given to the citizens of Magnesia has\nits effect and of what sort of virtue the educational program of\nMagnesia can or tends to produce.\n\nPlato also offers some discussion of the standards of music and poetry\nin their own right in the course of his discussion of education. As in\nother works, Plato is quite critical of the ethical content of poetry\nand the ethical knowledge possessed by the poet (see e.g.\nLaws 719A\u2013C, 811B\u2013E) and heavily censors the\npoetry that will be allowed into the city (see e.g. Laws\n657B, 719B\u2013D, 796E\u2013802E). Plato also here offers a\nsomewhat obscure discussion of the standard for correctness in music,\nsaying both that it must be judged by the pleasure of the virtuous man\n(Laws 659A) and that, because music is imitative, the\nstandard must involve not pleasure but truth, and that correct music\nis music which resembles the imitation of the beautiful (Laws\n 668A\u2013B).[51]\n8. Theology\n\nThe Athenian opens the dialogue by asking Kleinias and Megillus\nwhether god or some man is responsible for their laws, and they answer\nthat, for each of them, it is a god (Zeus for the Cretans and Apollo\nfor the\n Spartans).[52]\n God is thus presented from the very start of the dialogue as the\nappropriate source of law and human institutions. This notion of god\nas the lawgiver or ruler for a city returns in Book 4, when the three\nare considering what sort of constitution to give to their new city:\nthere, the Athenian claims that the best ruler for a city to have is\ngod, and that they ought to imitate the rule of god by ordering their\nsociety in obedience to the immortal element within themselves, namely\nreason, which here will have the name of law (Laws 714A; see\nalso Laws 762E, where service to the laws is said to be\nservice to the gods). God is also presented in the Laws as\nthe appropriate model for a human life. In the address to the new\nsettlers, they are told that they ought to become like god, and that\nto do this is to become virtuous; in fact, the Athenian claims that\ngod is the measure of human affairs, where this means that god, by\npossessing the virtues, embodies the standard to which we should aim\n(Laws\n 716C\u2013D).[53]\n It is also worth noting that the early books of the Laws\noften present a fairly traditional theology: we\u2019re encouraged to\npray to the gods, the gods are presented as having the power to\nintervene in human affairs, and the Athenian happily uses the names of\nthe Olympian gods (see e.g. Laws 717A, 828B\u2013D).\n\nBook 10 takes up the existence and nature of the god(s) as its main\ntheme, and it is here that we get the most sophisticated theology the\nLaws has to offer. The bulk of the book is presented as the\nprelude to impiety laws, and consists in an argument against three\nbeliefs which are the characteristic causes of impiety: (1) that the\ngods do not exist; (2) that the gods are not concerned with human\nbeings; and (3) that the gods can be influenced by prayers and\nsacrifices.\n\nThe Athenian begins by addressing those who believe that the gods do\nnot exist. He attributes to these people the view that it is material\nsubstances which exist by nature and which are the causes of the\nmotions we see in the cosmos, and says that what they\u2019ve failed\nto understand is the nature and power of soul \u2013 that is, the\nfact that soul is \u201camong the first things\u201d and older than\nbodies, and that \u201cit more than anything governs their changes\nand all of their transformations\u201d (Laws\n 892A2\u20137).[54]\n He begins by arguing that soul, which he here defines in terms of\nself-motion, must be the source of all other motions, as none of them\nhave the capacity to move themselves. Soul is not simply the original\nsource of all motion, however; the Athenian also claims that it\ngoverns the motion of all bodies which are in motion by using\nits own characteristic motions (e.g., wishing and believing) to take\nover the secondary motions of\n bodies.[55]\n As soul governs the motion of bodies in general, it must govern the\nmotions of the heavens in particular (896E); and as those motions are\norderly, they must be governed by a good soul possessing reason rather\nthan a bad soul (897B\u2013898C). The Athenian then says that such a\nsoul \u2013 one possessing reason and governing the orderly motions\nof the heavens \u2013 ought to be regarded as a god (899A\u2013B).\nThis concludes the argument with someone who thinks that the gods do\nnot exist. The Athenian then turns to argue that god (or, the gods)\ncare for human beings and cannot be bribed. These arguments crucially\nappeal to a characterization of god as a craftsman and a ruler: god\nwould be a poor craftsman indeed if he did not attend to even the\nsmall parts of the whole (i.e., human beings), and a bad ruler if he\ncould be bribed with prayers and\n sacrifices.[56]\n\nThese arguments raise a number of questions:\n\n\n\nThe Athenian goes back and forth, in the entire text of the\nLaws, between speaking of \u2018god\u2019 and \u2018the\ngods\u2019. How many gods are there, and, if more than one, is there\none which is somehow\n supreme?[57]\n\n\n\nWhat is the nature of a god? Plato\u2019s argument demonstrates that\nthere are gods by identifying a certain sort of soul \u2013 one that\npossesses reason and governs the heavens \u2013 as a god. Are\nall gods like this, or can there be a god without soul? Plato\nalso claims that soul is \u201camong the first things to have come\ninto being\u201d (892C4). Do some or all gods come into being, or is\nthere a god who has always\n existed?[58]\n\n\n\nSoul is said to be the cause of all motions and, thus, \u201cof good\nthings and bad\u201d (896D6), and Plato suggests the hypothesis of an\nevil soul precisely to explain bad things (896E). On the other hand,\nPlato elsewhere explains the existence of evil in other\n terms[59];\n and soul and especially god are deeply linked to reason and good\norder in this discussion. Is a cosmic soul (either good or bad)\nresponsible for evil in the Laws, or is there some other\ncause of\n evil?[60]\n\n\n\nHow do cosmic souls govern the motions of the celestial bodies? Is it\nby being within them, by acting on them by means of some external\nmatter, or in some other\n way?[61]\n\n\n\nFinally, how does the theology of the Laws relate to the\ntheology of other late dialogues such as the Timaeus,\nPhilebus, and\n Statesman?[62]\n\n\n\nWhat is clear from the theological discussion in Book 10, however, is\nthat god is something which governs the cosmos, by using reason, in a\nway that aims at its best state. This adds richness to the idea that\ngod and god\u2019s rule provides a standard for law and for\nindividual human lives: just as god governs the cosmos, so too law\ngoverns a society and reason an individual, in all cases for the sake\nof their best\n state.[63]\n9. Ethics\n\nThere is a strong case to be made that Plato, as in other works,\naccepts rational eudaimonism in the Laws: that is, that he\nbelieves that each individual\u2019s goal, insofar as he is rational,\nis his own happiness or well-being (eudaimonia). Some of the\nmost explicit evidence for this can be found at Laws\n662C\u2013E, in which the Athenian presents as appropriate the demand\nthat the life that is recommended by an ancestor or a god be the\nhappiest and most pleasant\n life[64];\n but the emphasis the Laws places on the happiness of the\ncitizens as the aim of the laws and the importance it gives to showing\nthat virtue conduces to a happy and a pleasant life also suggest that\nPlato remains within a eudaimonist framework. The Laws also\noffers some discussion of what it is that is good for a human being\n(as we would expect if Plato remains a rational eudaimonist). Plato\ndistinguishes between human goods such as health, beauty, and wealth,\nand divine goods, namely the virtues, and claims that human goods are\nnot good independently of virtue. Instead, they are good for the good\nman, but bad for the bad man (661B\u2013C; cf. 631D). There are\nimportant questions here about the precise nature of human\neudaimonia and the precise way in which the human goods\nbenefit the good man and fail to benefit or even harm the bad man. Is\nvirtue sufficient or only necessary for\n eudaimonia?[65]\n Do the human goods benefit the good man only insofar as they increase\nhis capacity to act virtuously, and harm the bad man only insofar as\nthey increase his capacity to act viciously, or is there additional\nvalue and disvalue in the possession of human goods, e.g. are they\ngenuinely good in a way that can only be appreciated by those who are\n virtuous?[66]\n What is clear from this discussion, however, is that virtue is an\nessential component of human happiness and a precondition for all\nother benefit.\n\nSeveral passages in the Laws suggest that the sort of virtue\nthat Plato thinks the citizens of Magnesia ought to exhibit involves\nan impartialist sort of regard for the good of the cosmos as a whole\nrather than a special regard for one\u2019s own good. Perhaps the\nmost striking of these passages occur in the midst of the theological\ndiscussions in Book 10. Immediately after the Athenian\u2019s\narguments that god does not neglect men, he goes on to give a short\nspeech in which he declares that the cosmos has been put together by\ngod with a view to the safety and virtue of the whole, and that the\nparts of the cosmos \u2013 including human beings \u2013 have come\nto be for the sake of the eudaimonia (happiness or\nwell-being) of the whole\n cosmos[67]\n (Laws 903B\u2013D). This passage suggests that what it is\nproper for human beings to do, insofar as they are parts of the cosmos\nand generated for the sake of its eudaimonia, is to aim at\nits eudaimonia; and this suggestion is confirmed by a passage\nwhich follows closely upon this one, in which the Athenian portrays\nhuman beings as the allies and the possessions of the gods in a cosmic\nbattle of good against evil (Laws 905E8\u2013906B3).\nFinally, towards the beginning of the Great Prelude to the laws in\ngeneral, Plato warns about the evil of self-love and suggests that\nwhat each man must do instead is to love \u201cneither himself nor\nhis own belongings, but things just, whether they happen to be actions\nof his own or rather those of another man\u201d (Laws\n731D\u2013732A). This looks like a rejection of partiality to oneself\nas such, and a requirement to instead love what is of value. The\nargument turns on the thought that a lover is a bad judge of value, as\nhe is necessarily partial to what he loves. If this is right, the\nconclusion is very radical indeed: any sort of love that is directed\nat anything other than the just and good and fine will be problematic,\nand this will include love of family, friends, and fellow-citizens,\nexcept insofar as they are just, good and fine. While these three\npassages are different in detail, the picture that emerges from them\nis one on which what we are meant to do is to orient ourselves towards\nwhat is of genuine value and, perhaps as a consequence, to aim at the\nwell-being of the cosmos as a whole, rather than to be oriented\ntowards our own narrowly-construed good or the good of particular\nindividuals as such.\n\nThe discussion of these passages is still at a very early stage and no\nconsensus about how to understand them has yet emerged. However, if we\ndo think that they show that Plato held impartialist ethical views in\nthe Laws, we will be left with important questions about how\nto reconcile those views with his eudaimonism. What conception of an\nindividual\u2019s own happiness or well-being could yield as a\nconclusion that one ought to aim at the happiness or well-being of the\ncosmos as a whole rather than one\u2019s own (narrowly construed)\nhappiness? And what assumptions would make it plausible to think that\nmy aiming at the well-being of the whole would necessarily correspond\nto something that was worth calling my own\n good?[68]\n (Why, for example, couldn\u2019t my aiming at the well-being of the\nwhole call on me to sacrifice myself to the good of others to the\nextent that I was no longer able to cultivate my own virtue and thus\ncould not, according to the Dependency Thesis, be benefited by\nanything at\n all?[69])\n\nWe might also profitably compare Plato\u2019s ethical views in the\nLaws to those which he expresses in the Republic.\nPlato in the Republic famously claims that the\nphilosopher-kings will return to rule as a matter of necessity, and\nthere is a large literature exploring just how this fits into a\neudaimonist framework, given that it looks like the narrowly-construed\ngood of the philosopher-kings would be best served by contemplation of\nthe Forms. It would be worth exploring the relationship between the\ntwo dialogues on this point, especially given that the Laws\nseems to endorse a conception of an individual\u2019s well-being\nwhich could lead them to set aside their own, narrowly-construed\nwell-being in just as, if not more, radical a way than the\nRepublic.\n10. Plato\u2019s Later Epistemology, Metaphysics, and Psychology\n\nWith respect to the specific controversies we have examined, for\nexample, that over the role of the preludes and that concerning the\npowers of the Nocturnal Council, we have found that the issues under\ndispute have important connections to Plato\u2019s epistemology and\npsychology. This should not, however, be surprising. To understand the\nnature of ethical learning and what ethical cognitive states can be\nproduced by different kinds of education, we must ultimately turn to\nPlato\u2019s epistemology, metaphysics, and psychology. Further,\nsince the appropriate political role for citizens depends in large\npart on the kinds of ethical character and knowledge (or true belief)\nthey can acquire, we can only understand Plato\u2019s later political\nphilosophy by understanding its connections with his later\nepistemology, metaphysics, and psychology.\n\nThe idea that Plato\u2019s ethics and politics rest, at least in\nlarge part, on his views in these other areas of philosophy is not\nnovel. Much of the best work on the ethical and political theory of\nthe Republic tries to draw such\n connections.[70]\n But this has not yet happened to anything approaching the same degree\nwith respect to his later ethics and\n politics.[71]\n This is due perhaps primarily to the fact that while the\nRepublic provides within itself an account articulated in\nsome detail not only of Plato\u2019s ethics and politics, but also of\nthe psychology, epistemology and metaphysics on which they rest, the\nLaws is comparatively lacking in extended argumentation on\nthese basic philosophical issues. But Plato is not trying in the Laws\nto provide a comprehensive philosophical statement of the sort found\nin the Republic. Questions of psychology, epistemology,\nethics and metaphysics (including the metaphysics of value) are\nexplored in great detail and with extraordinary sophistication in the\nother later dialogues. Indeed, they are treated in much more detail\nand with greater philosophical power than in the middle period. And it\nis these later dialogues that provide the indispensable background for\nunderstanding the Laws. Thus we should read it together with,\nfor example, the Philebus\u2019 metaphysics of value and\naccount of pleasure and with the epistemology and psychology of the\n Timaeus.[72]\n More cautiously, we should look for connections with the\nepistemology, metaphysics and psychology of other dialogues which are\nplausibly thought to be post-Republic, but do not fall into\nthe final group of six, such as the Phaedrus and the\n Theaetetus.[73]\n By examining Plato\u2019s philosophical positions in these later\ndialogues, we can work out the deeper justification for Plato\u2019s\nvision of political and ethical community in the Laws. And by\narticulating this vision, we gain greater understanding of the other\nlater dialogues on which it rests.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Commentaries, Text, and Translations", "Secondary Sources", "Other Bibliographies"], "cat_ref_text": {"Commentaries, Text, and Translations": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Burnet, J., 1901\u20137. <em>Platonis Opera</em>, 5 volumes,\nOxford: Oxford University Press.", "Bury, R., 1926. <em>Laws</em>, 2 volumes, New York: G.P.\nPutnam\u2019s Sons.", "Des Places, \u00c9. and A.
