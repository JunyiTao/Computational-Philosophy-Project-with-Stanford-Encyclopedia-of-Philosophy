    "main_text": "The Cognitive Science of Cultural Capacities\n3. The Cognitive Science of Cultural Capacities\n\nHumans, and some non-human animals, are natural social learners. A\ncrucial form of social learning is enabled by their cultural\ncapacities, typically understood as capacities that allow them to\nacquire and transmit cultural information. The number, character, and\ncontribution of the different psychological mechanisms that underlie\nthese cultural capacities remain a matter of much debate within\ncognitive science, as does the issue of which ones are required to\nproduce and sustain not just culture but complex cultural traits and\ncumulative culture. This section describes research that\ninvestigates these capacities, the methodological and evidential\nreasoning involved, and some of the conceptual issues that it\nraises.\n\nImportant caveat: for the purposes of this section, capacities and\nmechanisms are classified as \u201ccultural\u201d in virtue of their\nfunctionality, what they do. Broadly speaking, they count as\ncultural if they support the spread of cultural information. This is\nimportantly distinct from saying they are cultural in virtue of their\nprovenance. Some of the psychological mechanisms that enable\nthe acquisition and transmission of cultural information\u2014such as\nthose that underpin mindreading or normative cognition\u2014may\nthemselves be the products of cultural rather than biological\nevolution, and thus be mostly culturally inherited, e.g., cognitive\n\u2018gadgets\u2019 in Heyes\u2019 terminology (Heyes 2018a; Birch\n& Heyes 2021; also see\n Section 3.3).\n Other mechanisms that enable the acquisition and transmission of\ncultural information may be genetically inherited, e.g., cognitive\n\u201cinstincts.\u201d Both would count as contributing to cultural\ncapacities in the sense at issue here.\n",
