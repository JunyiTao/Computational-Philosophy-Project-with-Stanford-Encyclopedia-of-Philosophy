    "main_text": "Defining Public Goods and Distinguishing Between Different Kinds of Public Goods || Different Kinds of Public Goods\n1.3 Different Kinds of Public Goods\n\nDistinctions can also be drawn among public goods. Most\npublic goods do not affect all inhabitants of a large community\nequally. Fire protection services in Lower Manhattan are not consumed\nby those living in the Bronx, much less by Californians. Public parks\nbenefit those who live in the neighbourhood, playgrounds only those\nwho live in the neighbourhood and have children of a certain age (and\nindeed they might constitute a public bad for others). Charles Tiebout\nhas developed a theory of local government, after which the\nterm \u201clocal public good\u201d was coined (Tiebout 1956,\nStiglitz 1982). Other public goods may benefit all of humanity, such\nas climate change mitigation. We can therefore distinguish\nlocal, national, and global public goods\n(on the latter, see Kaul et al. 2003).\n\nA partial public good is one from whose consumption some\nindividuals can be excluded but not others. Mancur Olson gives the\nexample of a parade that is a public good for those living in tall\nbuildings overlooking the parade route but a private good to those who\nneed to buy a ticket for a seat in the stands along the way (Olson\n1971: 14). A full public good, by contrast, is one from whose\nconsumption all individuals can be excluded.\n",
