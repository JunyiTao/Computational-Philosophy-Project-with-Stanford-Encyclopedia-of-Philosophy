    "main_text": "The Fragment as Philosophical Form\n2. The Fragment as Philosophical Form\n\nThe very term romanticism is often traced back to the medieval novel\nof chivalry in which the hero\u2019s lonely fight against evil, sin,\nand moral weakness is fuelled by the twin motivation of faith and\nlove, hence reflecting a universe in which the individual is unified\nwith and understands himself through the de facto tradition\nto which he pledges allegiance. However, the turn to the Middle Ages\nis not primarily expressive of a sentimental cultivation of the past,\nbut had long been part of the German Enlightenment and its critique of\npolitical absolutism. Like the enlightenment philosophers, the Jena\nromantics were always clear that the organic unity of pre-modern\nsocieties was lost once and for all. When Novalis, in Christianity\nor Europe and other texts, wishes to revive the spirit of the\nMiddle Ages, he is frequently referring to the cosmopolitan thrust of\nthe Hanseatic League rather than a homogenous, tradition-based, and\nauthoritarian medieval culture. As such, Novalis\u2019s philosophy is\nresponsive to the conditions of modernity. In his work, modern\nphilosophy is seen as fundamentally self-reflexive in nature, as\nbelonging to the age of self-critical reason; that is, it is linked up\nwith the quest not only for first-order knowledge of nature and human\nbeing, but also for second-order knowledge of what human knowledge\ninvolves in the first place.\n\nAs a philosophical form, the fragment reflects the conditions of\nmodernity. In Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s view, the hyper-reflexive\nexpressive registers of irony and humor are particularly suited to\nvoice the modern mindset, and are, as such, intrinsically linked to\nthe fragment (such a view is also present in Novalis\u2019s writings,\nthough underemphasized in comparison with Friedrich Schlegel).\nNovalis\u2019s turn to the fragment has a different philosophical\nmotivation. The fragment questions the idea that philosophical\nsystem-building, be it of a deductive or a teleological kind, is fit\nto capture the nature of reality. Like\nBl\u00fcthenstaub\u2014though the title was added when Friedrich\nSchlegel was editing Novalis\u2019s text for publication\u2014the\nfragment emerges as an intellectual seed or pollen that is meant to\nfoster critical and independent reflection rather than presenting a\nsystem of self-contained theorizing.\n\nAlthough the fragment, as a philosophical form, is often associated\nwith the early Jena romantics, it was not invented by this group.\nRather, the fragment has a long history, stretching back to the\nancient Greeks, but also to modern writers such as Chamfort, La\nRochefoucauld, and Lichtenberg. (Chamfort\u2019s work was translated\ninto German in the 1790s and eagerly read and discussed at the time.)\nWithin circles closer to the romantics, Herder, from the late 1760s\non, had been exploring the philosophical potential of the fragment.\nHerder\u2019s turn to the fragment was motivated by a wide-spanning\nskepticism with regard to the idea of a totalizing or teleological\nsystem of reason. The young Herder leads this skepticism back to the\nphilosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment. Novalis makes frequent\nreferences to Herder\u2019s work and person.\n\nWith its broken form and literary style, Novalis\u2019s return to the\nfragment has been taken to challenge the distinction between art and\ncritical thinking that was entirely central to Kant and Fichte.\nHowever, while the fragment draws on the expressive registers of\nliterature, it does not represent a deconstruction of the difference\nbetween philosophy and poetry, science and art. It is, rather, an\nattempt, from within the realm of critical reason, to explore\na reality whose complex nature cannot be captured by the work of a\nnarrowly oriented rationality (Verstandesdenken, in the\neighteenth-century glossary). Like Schelling and Hegel, Novalis\nchallenges the dry and narrow understanding of reason that, in their\nview, had come to dominate the post-Enlightenment world of politics,\nscience, and letters. Like them, he does this not by appealing to the\npurely irrational, but by developing a notion of reason that includes\na dimension of historicity and takes into account the experience of\nart, literature, and religious and affective sentiments of various\nkinds. Unlike Schelling and Hegel, however, Novalis believes that such\na notion of reason can only be obtained by leaving behind the idea of\na final and all-encompassing philosophical system. But as Herder had\nbeen demonstrating already in the early 1770s, to question the idea of\nan all-encompassing system is not the same as to endorse intellectual\nchaos or unsystematic thought procedures. When reading the early\nromantic philosophy of Novalis, one should keep in mind the warning of\nhis friend Friedrich Schlegel: Just as a fully systematic philosophy\nmight be an illusion, a completely unsystematic philosophy would\ninstantly kill off every intellectual ambition. Thus the challenge of\nromantic philosophy consists in the attempt to think systematically\nbut without allowing thought to stagnate in a final set of truths or\ndogma. Philosophy ought to be open-ended; it should develop in close\ninteraction with the natural sciences as well as the humanities. In\nshort, philosophy should take the shape of a sustained intellectual\nexperiment; it should be forever on its way and thoroughly inductively\nminded. This philosophical credo runs through the entire work of\nNovalis, from Miscellaneous Observations to Notes for a\nRomantic Encyclopaedia (Das Allgemeine Brouillon) and\nChristianity or Europe.\n\nEven though the fragment is expressive of the\ndeeper\u2014anti-teleological, if one likes\u2014motivations of\nNovalis\u2019s thinking, it is easy to make too much of the form in\nwhich substantial parts of his work is handed down to us. As is made\nclear by the publication of the critical edition, many of\nNovalis\u2019s texts are available as fragments simply because he did\nnot have the time to polish his thoughts or because they were never\nintended for publication. Furthermore, a text such as Pollen,\nwhich was indeed intended for publication, was edited by Friedrich\nSchlegel, who broke up some of the longer passages into shorter\nfragments.\n",
