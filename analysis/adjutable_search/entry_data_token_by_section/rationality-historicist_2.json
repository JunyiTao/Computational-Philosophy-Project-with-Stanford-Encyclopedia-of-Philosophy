    "main_text": "Historicist Conceptions of Rationality: The Battle of the Big Systems || The Methodology of Scientific Research Programs\n1.3 The Methodology of Scientific Research Programs\n\nCriticism and the Growth of Knowledge (1970), edited by\nLakatos and Alan Musgrave, was a second major contribution to the\nhistoricism debate. This collection of articles, originating from a\n1965 London conference, was in significant respects a reaction to\nKuhn; but it is especially important for Lakatos\u2019s own\ncontribution to the volume, \u201cFalsification and the Methodology\nof Scientific Research Programmes\u201d (MSRP), an attempt to\naccommodate a broadly Popperian perspective to some of Kuhn\u2019s\nideas and thereby to diverge from Popperian orthodoxy. Lakatos had\nlong favored an historical approach to the philosophy of mathematics\nand science (see his 1976). One of his central concerns was to defend\nthe rational continuity and progressiveness of modern science from the\nchallenge of radical change. Another was to fend off charges of\nhistorical relativism.\n\nLike Kuhn\u2019s paradigms and Laudan\u2019s research traditions\n(see below), the unit of rational appraisal for Lakatos is not a\nsingle theory at a point in time; instead, it is a series of theories\nthat are rationally-connected moments in the development of an\nidentifiable research program. In MSRP these theories share a\nnegative heuristic containing inviolable principles and a\npositive heuristic that both provides a \u201cprotective\nbelt\u201d around the negative heuristic and guides future research.\nThe forward-looking heuristic element was, as for Kuhn, an important\nfeature missing from traditional accounts of science. In MSRP,\nresearch programs are evaluated as to their progressiveness\nover historical time, i.e., which grows knowledge fastest.\nLakatos\u2019s measure of knowledge growth is novel prediction, the\nadvantage going to which program yields more novel\ntheoretical predictions and more confirmed novel\npredictions than its competitors. This is a historicist position since\ndetermining whether something is a novel prediction requires detailed\nknowledge of the historical context of discovery in which the\npredictive theory was produced (Lakatos & Zahar 1976).\nUnfortunately, however, Lakatos\u2019s falsificationism had become so\nsophisticated that he could provide no rule for when it was rational\nto abandon a degenerating research program that was being outstripped\nby a more progressive one; for scientists, he said, may legitimately\nmake risky choices. In any case, contrary to Kuhn, two or more\nresearch programs may exist side-by-side. Lakatosian rationality does\nnot dictate that researchers all join the same program.\n\nWhat is the relation between a theory of scientific rationality and a\ngeneral methodology of science? Like the Popperians from which he\ndiverged, Lakatos held that methodologies are theories of\nscientific rationality (Curtis 1986). Similarly, a metamethodology\n(tasked with determining which methodology outperforms others) is\nidentical with a metatheory of scientific rationality. Lakatos\u2019s\nmetatheory recapitulates MSRP at the metalevel. According to Lakatos,\nhis meta-MSRP shows that MSRP defeats competing methodologies, because\nit provides the best fit with the history of science in the sense that\nit renders the history of science maximally rational. That is, MSRP\nmakes rational sense of both the intuitively rational episodes and\nsome that its competitors have to exclude as externally caused\ndeviations from the rational ideal. Indeed, it predicts that\nsome counterintuitive cases will be seen to be rational when examined\nclosely.\n\nLakatos\u2019s paper, \u201cThe History of Science and Its Rational\nReconstructions\u201d (1971: 91) opens with a promising paraphrase of\nKant (previously used by Hanson (1962: 575, 580) and by Herbert Feigl\n(1970: 4): \u201cPhilosophy of science without history of science is\nempty; history of science without philosophy of science is\nblind\u201d. However, his use of rational reconstructions of\nsupporting historical episodes\u2014the science as it allegedly could\nhave been done or should have been done\u2014made the actual\nscience look more internally correct (according to MSRP) than it was.\nHistorians and philosophical critics replied sharply that this was not\ngenuine history and hence not a fair test (see Arabatzis forthcoming).\n\nLakatos and his followers (e.g., Worrall 1988, 1989) conceived MSRP as\na fixed and final methodology by contrast with Kuhn\u2019s,\nToulmin\u2019s, and (eventually) Laudan\u2019s changing\nmethodologies. The idea that all previous history of science was\nworking up to this final methodology that Lakatos was first to\ndivine\u2014the end-of-history for methodology, so to speak\u2014was\none of the broadly Hegelian themes in Lakatos\u2019s work. Another\nwas that there is no instant rationality as proposed by the formal\napproaches of standard confirmation theory. Writes Daniel Little (in\nthe entry on\n philosophy of history)\n \u201cHegel finds reason in history; but it is a latent reason, and\none that can only be comprehended when the fullness of history\u2019s\nwork is finished\u2026 \u201d. The owl of Minerva flies out at\ndusk. For Lakatos rational judgments can only be made retrospectively.\nFor example, one cannot judge an experiment as crucial at the time it\noccurs, only in historical retrospect (1970: 154ff). Appraisals are\nmade with hindsight. (See the entry on\n Lakatos.)\n",
