In a widely cited paper,\nNisbett and Wilson (1977) present studies showing that subjects\nroutinely misidentify the factors that influenced their reasoning\nprocesses. For instance, subjects in one study explained their\npreference for a product by its apparent quality, when in fact the\nproducts were all precisely alike: the subjects\u2019 preferences\nwere apparently driven by the product\u2019s spatial position\nrelative to its competitors seemed to drive the preferences.\n\n\nThe accuracy of subject reports is so poor as to suggest that any\nintrospective access that may exist is not sufficient to produce\ngenerally correct or reliable reports. (1977: 33)\n\n\nWhile these studies are instructive, Wilson acknowledges that their\nresults are limited in that they apply only to the unconscious sources\nof decisions; they are silent as to our privileged access to our\ncurrent states. \n\n\n[T]o the extent that people\u2019s responses are caused by the\nconscious self, they have privileged access to the actual causes of\nthese responses; in short, the Nisbett and Wilson argument was wrong\nabout such cases. (Wilson 2002: 106)\n\n\nSchwitzgebel (2002) has marshalled other sorts of empirical evidence\nto show that introspective reports are unreliable. But he has also\nsuggested that our attitudes about introspection may be particularly\nobstinate. This conclusion is borne out by his collaboration with a\npsychologist on a study of introspection using a method called\nExperience Sampling (Hurlburt and Schwitzgebel 2007). Strikingly,\ntheir careful analysis of the study\u2019s results does not resolve\ntheir differences about the reliability of introspection: Hurlburt\nremains \u201coptimistic\u201d about introspection\u2019s\nreliability while Schwitzgebel remains \u201ca skeptic\u201d).\n\nThis outcome suggests that not only careful empirical work, but also\ndifficult conceptual work, is required for determining the scope and\ndegree of introspection\u2019s reliability\u2014solving what Goldman\naptly terms \u201cthe problem of calibration\u201d (Goldman 2004:\n14). Some targets of introspection, such as sensations, can be\nidentified only through introspection itself: third-personal methods\n(for instance, identifying pain via a brain scan) depend on prior\ncorrelations between third-personal and introspective data. Goldman\nnotes that, for this reason, we can fix the range of introspective\nreliability only by using introspection and evaluating its\nresults for internal coherence and for consistency with other sources.\nBut since there is no clear consensus as to how to evaluate the\nresults of introspection, or how to weigh its results against other\nsources of evidence about mental states, the problem of calibration is\nespecially thorny and complex as it relates to introspection. Spener\n(2015) proposes that we calibrate introspection by reference to\nabilities that we could not possess unless introspection were reliable\n(relative to certain circumstances, and about certain states). For\nexample, our ability to focus binoculars on a distant object suggests\nthat introspection is reliable in identifying when things look\nblurry.\n",
