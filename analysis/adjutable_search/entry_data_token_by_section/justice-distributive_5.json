    "main_text": "Desert-Based Principles\n6. Desert-Based Principles\n\nAnother complaint against welfarism is that it ignores, and in fact\ncannot even make sense of, claims that people deserve certain\neconomic benefits in light of their actions (Feinberg, Lamont 1997).\nThe complaint is often motivated by the concern that various forms of\nwelfarism treat people as mere containers for well-being, rather than\npurposeful beings, responsible for their actions and creative in their\nenvironments. \n\nThe various proposed\n desert-based\n principles of distribution differ primarily according to what they\nidentify as the basis for deserving. While Aristotle proposed virtue,\nor moral character, to be the best desert-basis for economic\ndistribution, contemporary desert theorists have proposed desert-bases\nthat are more practically implemented in complex modern societies.\nMost contemporary desert theorists have pursued John Locke\u2019s\nlead in this respect. Locke argued people deserve to have those items\nproduced by their toil and industry, the products (or the value\nthereof) being a fitting reward for their effort (see Miller 1989).\nLocke\u2019s underlying idea was to guarantee to individuals the\nfruits of their own labor and abstinence. Most contemporary proposals\nfor desert-bases fit into one of three broad categories:\n\nContribution: People should be rewarded for their work activity\naccording to the value of their contribution to the social product.\n(Miller 1976, Miller 1989, Riley 1989)\nEffort: People should be rewarded according to the effort they\nexpend in their work activity (Sadurski 1985a,b, Milne 1986). \nCompensation: People should be rewarded according to the costs\nthey incur in their work activity (Dick 1975, Lamont 1997).\n\n\nAccording to the contemporary desert theorist, people freely apply\ntheir abilities and talents, in varying degrees, to socially\nproductive work. People come to deserve varying levels of income by\nproviding goods and services desired by others (Feinberg 1970).\nDistributive systems are just insofar as they distribute incomes\naccording to the different levels earned or deserved by the\nindividuals in the society for their productive labors, efforts, or\ncontributions.\n\nContemporary desert-principles all share the value of raising the\nstandard of living\u2014collectively, \u2018the social\nproduct\u2019. Under each principle, only activity directed at\nraising the social product will serve as a basis for deserving income.\nThe concept of desert itself does not yield this value of raising the\nsocial product; it is a value societies hold independently. Hence,\ndesert principles identifying desert-bases tied to socially productive\nactivity (productivity, compensation, and effort all being examples of\nsuch bases) do not do so because the concept of desert requires this.\nThey do so because societies value higher standards of living, and\ntherefore choose the raising of living standards as the primary value\nrelevant to desert-based distribution. This means that the full\ndevelopment of desert-based principles requires specification (and\ndefense) of those activities which will or will not count as socially\nproductive, and hence as deserving of remuneration (Lamont 1994).\n\nIt is important to distinguish desert-payments from entitlements. For\ndesert theorists a well-designed institutional structure will make it\nso that many of the entitlements people have are deserved. But\nentitlements and just deserts are not conceptually the same and\nregularly come apart. For instance, as Feinberg notes, a person can be\nentitled to assume the presidential office without deserving it\n(Feinberg 1970, 86) and a person who accidentally apprehends a\ncriminal may be entitled to a reward but not deserve it. Conversely, a\nteam may deserve to win the championship prize but not be entitled to\nit or a person may deserve an economic benefit but not be entitled to\nit. Indeed, these and many other instances of desert and entitlements\ncoming apart provide the bases for desert theorists to argue for\ninstitutional reform. For desert theorists, the institutional\nstructure should facilitate people\u2019s economic entitlements\n(including one\u2019s property holdings) tracking their just\ndeserts.\n\nPayments designed to give people incentives are a form of entitlement\nparticularly worth distinguishing from desert-payments as they are\ncommonly confused (Barry 1965, 111\u2013112). Incentive-payments are\n\u2018forward-looking\u2019 in that they are set up to create a\nsituation in the future, while desert-payments are\n\u2018backwards-looking\u2019in that they are justified with\nreference to work in the present or past. Even though it is possible\nfor the same payment to be both deserved and an incentive, incentives\nand desert provide distinct rationales for income and should not be\nconflated (Lamont 1997).\n\nWhile some have sought to justify current capitalist distributions via\ndesert-based distributive principles, John Stuart Mill and many since\nhave forcefully argued the contrary claim\u2014that the\nimplementation of a productivity principle would involve dramatic\nchanges in modern market economies and would greatly reduce the\ninequalities characteristic of them. It is important to note, though,\nthat contemporary desert-based principles are rarely complete\ndistributive principles. They usually are only designed to cover\ndistribution among working adults, leaving basic welfare needs to be\nmet by other principles.\n\nThe specification and implementation problems for desert-based\ndistribution principles revolve mainly around the desert-bases: it is\ndifficult to identify what is to count as a contribution, an effort or\na cost, and it is even more difficult to measure these in a complex\nmodern economy.\n\nThe main moral objection to desert-based principles is that they make\neconomic benefits depend on factors over which people have little\ncontrol. John Rawls has made one of the most widely discussed\narguments to this effect (Rawls 1971), and while a strong form of this\nargument has been clearly refuted (Zaitchik, Sher), it remains a\nproblem for desert-based principles. The problem is most pronounced in\nthe case of productivity-based principles\u2014people\u2019s\nproductivity seems clearly to be influenced by many factors over which\nthey have little control.\n\nIt is interesting to note that under most welfare-based principles, it\nis also the case that people\u2019s level of economic benefits\ndepends on factors beyond their control. But welfarists view this as a\nvirtue of their theory, since they think the only morally relevant\ncharacteristic of any distribution is the welfare resulting from it.\nWhether the distribution ties economic benefits to matters beyond our\ncontrol is morally irrelevant from the welfarist point of view. (As it\nhappens, welfarists often hold the empirical claim that people have\nlittle control over their contributions to society anyway.) However,\nfor people\u2019s benefits to depend on factors beyond their control\nis a more awkward result for desert theorists who, with luck\negalitarians, emphasize the responsibility of people in choosing to\nengage in more or less productive activities.\n",
