    "main_text": "Feyerabend\u2019s Later Work: Towards Relativism, but then Beyond It || Against Method (1970\u201375)\n5.1 Against Method (1970\u201375)\n\nAfter stints in London, Berlin, and Yale (all of them running\nalongside his post at UC Berkeley), Feyerabend took up a visiting\nprofessorship at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and lectured\nthere in 1972 and 1974 (pp. 134\u20135). He even considered settling\ndown in New Zealand around that time (p. 153), although this hardly\nseems compatible with his jet-setting lifestyle. \n\nBy the early 1970s Feyerabend had flown the falsificationist coop and\nwas ready to expound his own perspective on scientific method. In\n1970, he published a long article entitled \u201cAgainst\nMethod\u201d in which he attacked several prominent accounts of\nscientific methodology. In their correspondence, he and Lakatos\nsubsequently planned the construction of a debate volume, to be\nentitled For and Against Method, in which Lakatos would put\nforward the \u201crationalist\u201d case that there was an\nidentifiable set of rules of scientific method which make all good\nscience science, and Feyerabend would attack it. Lakatos\u2019\nunexpected death in February 1974, which seems to have shocked\nFeyerabend deeply, meant that the rationalist part of the joint work\nwas never completed.\n\nLater that year, Feyerabend found himself lecturing at the University\nof Sussex:\n\nI have no idea why and how I went to the University of Sussex at\nBrighton\u2026 what I do remember is that I taught two terms\n(1974/1975) and then resigned; twelve hours a week (one lecture\ncourse, the rest tutorials) was too much. (p. 153).\n\n\nA member of Feyerabend\u2019s audience recalls things in rather more\ndetail:\n\nSussex University: the start of the Autumn Term, 1974. There was not a\nseat to be had in the biggest Arts lecture theatre on campus. Taut\nwith anticipation, we waited expectantly and impatiently for the\nadvertized event to begin. He was not on time\u2014as usual. In fact\nrumour had it that he would not be appearing at all that illness (or\nwas it just ennui? or perhaps a mistress?) had confined him to bed.\nBut just as we began sadly to reconcile ourselves to the idea that\nthere would be no performance that day at all, Paul Feyerabend burst\nthrough the door at the front of the packed hall. Rather pale, and\nsupporting himself on a short metal crutch, he walked with a limp\nacross to the blackboard. Removing his sweater he picked up the chalk\nand wrote down three questions one beneath the other: What\u2019s so\ngreat about knowledge? What\u2019s so great about science?\nWhat\u2019s so great about truth? We were not going to be\ndisappointed after all!\n\n\nDuring the following weeks of that term, and for the rest of his year\nas a visiting lecturer, Feyerabend demolished virtually every\ntraditional academic boundary. He held no idea and no person sacred.\nWith unprecedented energy and enthusiasm he discussed anything from\nAristotle to the Azande. How does science differ from witchcraft? Does\nit provide the only rational way of cognitively organizing our\nexperience? What should we do if the pursuit of truth cripples our\nintellects and stunts our individuality? Suddenly epistemology became\nan exhilarating area of investigation.\n\nFeyerabend created spaces in which people could breathe again. He\ndemanded of philosophers that they be receptive to ideas from the most\ndisparate and apparently far-flung domains, and insisted that only in\nthis way could they understand the processes whereby knowledge grows.\nHis listeners were enthralled, and he held his huge audiences until,\ntoo ill and too exhausted to continue, he simply began repeating\nhimself. But not before he had brought the house down by writing\n\u201cAristotle\u201d in three-foot high letters on the blackboard\nand then writing \u201cPopper\u201d in tiny, virtually illegible\nletters beneath it! (Krige 1980, pp. 106\u20137).\n\n\nBecause his health was poor, Feyerabend started seeing a healer who\nhad been recommended to him. The treatment was successful, and\nthenceforth Feyerabend used to refer to his own case as an example of\nboth the failures of orthodox medicine and the largely unexplored\npossibilities of \u201calternative\u201d or traditional remedies.\n\n\nInstead of the volume written jointly with Lakatos, Feyerabend put\ntogether his tour de force, the book version of Against\nMethod (London: New Left Books, 1975), which he sometimes\nconceived of as a letter to Lakatos (to whom the book is dedicated). A\nmore accurate description, however, is the one given in his\nautobiography:\n\nAM is not a book, it is a collage. It contains descriptions,\nanalyses, arguments that I had published, in almost the same words,\nten, fifteen, even twenty years earlier\u2026 I arranged them in a\nsuitable order, added transitions, replaced moderate passages with\nmore outrageous ones, and called the result \u201canarchism\u201d. I\nloved to shock people\u2026 (pp. 139, 142).\n\n\nThe book contained many of the themes mentioned so far in this essay,\nsprinkled into a case study of the transition from geocentric to\nheliocentric astronomy. But whereas he had previously been arguing in\nfavour of methodology (a \u201cpluralistic\u201d methodology, that\nis), he had now become dissatisfied with any methodology. He\nemphasised that older scientific theories, like Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory of motion, had powerful empirical and argumentative support,\nand stressed, correlatively, that the heroes of the scientific\nrevolution, such as Galileo, were not as scrupulous as they were\nsometimes represented to be. He portrayed Galileo as making full use\nof rhetoric, propaganda, and various epistemological tricks in order\nto support the heliocentric position. The Galileo case is crucial for\nFeyerabend, since the \u201cscientific revolution\u201d is his\nparadigm of scientific progress and of radical conceptual change, and\nGalileo is his hero of the scientific revolution. He also sought\nfurther to downgrade the importance of empirical arguments by\nsuggesting that aesthetic criteria, personal whims and social factors\nhave a far more decisive role in the history of science than\nrationalist or empiricist historiography would indicate. \n\nAgainst Method explicitly drew the \u201cepistemological\nanarchist\u201d conclusion that there are no useful and exceptionless\nmethodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth\nof knowledge. The history of science is so complex that if we insist\non a general methodology which will not inhibit progress the only\n\u201crule\u201d it will contain will be the useless suggestion:\n\u201canything goes\u201d. In particular, logical empiricist\nmethodologies and Popper\u2019s Critical Rationalism would inhibit\nscientific progress by enforcing restrictive conditions on new\ntheories. The more sophisticated \u201cmethodology of scientific\nresearch programmes\u201d developed by Lakatos either contains\nungrounded value-judgements about what constitutes good science, or is\nreasonable only because it is epistemological anarchism in disguise.\nThe phenomenon of incommensurability renders the standards which these\n\u201crationalists\u201d use for comparing theories inapplicable.\nThe book thus (understandably) had Feyerabend branded an\n\u201cirrationalist\u201d. At a time when Kuhn was downplaying the\n\u201cirrationalist\u201d implications of his own book, Feyerabend\nwas perceived to be casting himself in the role others already saw as\nhis for the taking. (He did not, however, commit himself to\npolitical anarchism. His political philosophy was a mixture\nof liberalism and social democracy).\n\nHe later said:\n\nOne of my motives for writing Against Method was to free\npeople from the tyranny of philosophical obfuscators and abstract\nconcepts such as \u201ctruth\u201d, \u201creality\u201d, or\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d, which narrow people\u2019s vision and ways\nof being in the world. Formulating what I thought were my own attitude\nand convictions, I unfortunately ended up by introducing concepts of\nsimilar rigidity, such as \u201cdemocracy\u201d,\n\u201ctradition\u201d, or \u201crelative truth\u201d. Now that I\nam aware of it, I wonder how it happened. The urge to explain\none\u2019s own ideas, not simply, not in a story, but by means of a\n\u201csystematic account\u201d, is powerful indeed. (pp.\n179\u201380).\n\n",
