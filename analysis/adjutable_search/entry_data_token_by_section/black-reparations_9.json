    "main_text": "Supersession and Historic Injustices\n10. Reparations Policies\n\nNot much has been published on possible policies of reparations to\nU.S. blacks. But at least a few words concerning such matters are in\norder in case said reparations are morally justified\nand\n required.[5]\nA rights-based\napproach to reparations to U.S. blacks by the U.S. government might\nmost plausibly construe such reparations both compensatorily and\nnon-compensatorily. In so doing, reparations are a cluster of rights to\nsuch means of corrective justice imposing duties on the U.S. government\nto provide said reparations to U.S. blacks. The provision of such\nrights is not to be diminished due to the amount of that which is owed,\nthough it would be counter-productive to settle on an amount or demand\nso much that the U.S. could not possibly pay it. The main point is to\nestimate a combined figure that captures the fact that the peculiar\ninstitution was widely and deeply supported by several U.S. industries\nand workforces, from U.S. financial institutions to ship builders, from\nU.S. lawmakers and courts to slave owners, and well beyond (DeWolf\n2008). Thus it is not unreasonable to argue that there was and remains\na collective liability of the U.S. to provide such reparations (Corlett\n2010: 161\u2013186; McGary 1999).\n\nCompensatory reparations can be calculated with approximation by\nfiguring on a moderate number of sub-Saharan Africans who were brought\nagainst their wills to the territory of the U.S. to serve as slaves.\nThen a moderate estimation can be made of average life expectancy of\nsaid slaves, and how many hours a day and per week, etc. said slaves\nworked without monetary compensation. Perhaps even more important are\nthe human rights abuses of slavery itself, an amount that might be\nestimated in terms of punitive damages. There are also social,\npolitical and psychological effects of slavery, among others, damages\nto some extent lingering amongst several U.S. black communities\nthroughout the U.S..\n\nHowever, in order to respect the sovereignty of U.S. blacks as a\npeople and their autonomy as individuals, no presumption should be made\nthat would make the provision of reparations to them dependent on the\nreconciliation between said blacks and the U.S.. In order to effect\nthis, a Committee on Black Reparations might be established only by\nvote of U.S. blacks, having a 3\u20134 year service for each member. There\nwould be no shortage of highly qualified U.S. blacks to serve\nexcellently on said committee: from educators, business persons,\nattorneys, medical experts, etc.. Said committee would alone decide\nwhat to do with the monetary reparations paid by the U.S. Treasury. An\nannual audit of the transactions between the two parties could be\nconducted by a party of the committee\u2019s choice.\n\nSince the amount of compensatory reparations would likely reach into\nthe trillions of dollars, the U.S. Congress would be asked to pass into\nlaw a U.S. Black Reparations Tax which might amount to a 3% tax on\nevery income made in the U.S., in perpetuity (In perpetuity because of\nthe relatively low percentage of the tax). The taxes received by the\ncommittee would presumably be used for the education of U.S. blacks,\nmedical costs, job training, retirement benefits, cash disbursements\nfor rent, mortgage payments, etc.. \n\nBut also owed to U.S. blacks are non-compensatory reparations. Among\nother things, the names and images of the confederacy have no place in\nofficial public spaces as if they represented the U.S., state or local\ngovernment. This is because, among other things, the U.S. Civil War was\n(at least in the minds of many) supposed to symbolize the bloody and\npainful sacrifice of many soldiers and families for the sake of\ninstituting a slaveless society. Because of this, U.S. history books\nmust continue to be revised in order to provide more balanced and\naccurate stories of the truth, inclusive of all peoples. This includes\nthe revelation of the ugliest of truths often shrouded in myths in the\nname of U.S. patriotism. But genuine patriotism has nothing to do with\nmisleading or false information dressed in the guise of history. It\nmust often recount the evils of the 1921Tulsa, Oklahoma massacre of\nU.S. blacks by whites, the 1923 Rosewood, Florida massacre of many U.S.\nblacks by many U.S. whites, the murder of Emmet Till and the lynchings\nof thousands of other blacks, and the pervasive terrorism of U.S.\nblacks by the KKK. Continued recognition of such evils must replace\nself-serving glorified images and imaginings which persist to this very\nday in the minds of many U.S. whites that in one way or another promote\nwhite privilege. Such changes should be lawfully instituted, not\nbecause to fail to do so would stand as offensive (Corlett 2018), but\nrather because truth, justice and fairness demand it.\n",
