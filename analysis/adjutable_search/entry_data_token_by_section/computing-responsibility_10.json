    "main_text": "Rethinking the concept of moral responsibility || Responsibility as practice\n3.2 Responsibility as practice\n\nSantonio de Sio and van den Hoven\u2019s analysis of meaningful human\ncontrol draws attention to the social function of moral\nresponsibility, which provides yet another perspective on the issue\n(Stahl 2006; Tigard 2021b). Both prospectively and retrospectively,\nresponsibility works to organize social relations between people and\nbetween people and institutions. It sets expectations between people\nfor the fulfillment of certain obligations and duties and provides the\nmeans to correct or encourage certain behavior. For instance, a\nrobotics company is expected to build in safeguards that prevent\nrobots from harming humans. If the company fails to live up to this\nexpectation, it will be held accountable and in some cases it will\nhave to pay for damages or undergo some other kind of punishment. The\npunishment or prospect of punishment can encourage the company to have\nmore regard for system safety, reliability, sound design and the risks\ninvolved in their production of robots. It might trigger the company\nto take actions to prevent future accidents. Yet, it might also\nencourage it to find ways to shift the blame. The idea that\nresponsibility is about interpersonal relationships and expectations\nabout duties and obligations places the focus on the practices of\nholding someone responsible (Strawson 1962, Talbert 2022).\n\nThe particular practices and social structures that are in place to\nascribe responsibility and hold people accountable, have an influence\non how we relate to technologies. Just before the turn of the century,\nNissenbaum already noted that the difficulties in attributing moral\nresponsibility can, to a large extent, be traced back to the\nparticular characteristics of the organizational and cultural context\nin which computer technologies are embedded. She argued that how we\nconceive of the nature, capacities and limitations of computing is of\ninfluence on the answerability of those who develop and use computer\ntechnologies (1997). At the time, she observed a systematic erosion of\naccountability in our increasingly computerized society, where she\nconceived of accountability as a value and a practice that places an\nemphasis on preventing harm and risk. Accountability means there will\nbe someone, or several people, to answer not only for the malfunctions\nin life-critical systems that cause or risk grave injuries and cause\ninfrastructure and large monetary losses, but even for the malfunction\nthat cause individual losses of time, convenience, and contentment\n(1994, p. 74). It can be used as \u201ca powerful tool for motivating\nbetter practices, and consequently more reliable and trustworthy\nsystems\u201d (1997, p. 43). Holding people accountable for the harms\nor risks caused by computer systems provides a strong incentive to\nminimize them and can provide a starting point for assigning just\npunishment.\n\nCultural and organizational practices, at the time, however seemed to\ndo the opposite, due to \u201cthe conditions under which computer\ntechnologies are commonly developed and deployed, coupled with popular\nconceptions about the nature, capacities and limitations of\ncomputing\u201d (p. 43). Nissenbaum identified four barriers to\naccountability in society: (1) the problem of many hands, (2) the\nacceptance of computer bugs as an inherent element of large software\nsystems, (3) using the computer as scapegoat and (4) ownership without\nliability. According to Nissenbaum people have a tendency to shirk\nresponsibility and to shift the blame to others when accidents occur.\nThe problem of many hands and the idea that software bugs are an\ninevitable by-product of complex computer systems are too easily\naccepted as excuses for not answering for harmful outcomes. People are\nalso inclined to point the finger at the complexity of the computer\nand argue that \u201cit was the computer\u2019s fault\u201d when\nthings go wrong. Finally, she perceived a tendency of companies to\nclaim ownership of the software they developed, but to dismiss the\nresponsibilities that come with ownership. To illustrate, she pointed\nto extended license agreements that assert a manufacturer\u2019s\nownership of software, but disclaim any accountability for the quality\nor performance of the product. \n\nThese four barriers, Nissenbaum argued, stand in the way of a\n\u201cculture of accountability\u201d that is aimed at maintaining\nclear lines of accountability. Such a culture fosters a strong sense\nof responsibility as a virtue to be encouraged and everyone connected\nto an outcome of particular actions is answerable for it.\nAccountability, according to Nissenbaum, is different from liability.\nLiability is about looking for a person to blame and to compensate for\ndamages suffered after the event. Once that person has been found,\nothers can be let \u2018off the hook\u2019, which may encourage\npeople to look for excuses, such as blaming the computer.\nAccountability, however, applies to all those involved. It requires a\nparticular kind of organizational context, one in which answerability\nworks to entice people to pay greater attention to system safety,\nreliability and sound design, in order to establish a culture of\naccountability (see also Martin 2019, Herkert et AL 2020) . An\norganization that places less value on accountability and that has\nlittle regards for responsibilities in organizing their production\nprocesses is more likely to allow their technological products to\nbecome incomprehensible. Nissenbaum\u2019s analysis illustrates that\nour practices of holding someone responsible - the established ways of\nholding people to account and of conveying expectations about duties\nand obligations - are continuously changing and negotiated, partly as\na response to the introduction of new technologies (see also Noorman\n2012).\n\nA lack of such a culture of accountability can lead to responsibility\nbeing attributed to the wrong people. These people become, what\nMadeleine Clare Elish calls the moral crumple zone (2019).\nThese human actors absorb responsibility, even though they only have\nvery limited or no control over the systems they work with. Elish\nargues that, given the complexity of technological systems, the media\nand the public tend to blame accidents on human error and misattribute\nresponsibility to the nearest human operator, such as a pilot or\nmaintenance personnel, rather than the technological systems or the\ndecision-makers higher up the chain.\n\nNissenbaum argued that the context in which technologies are developed\nand used has a significant influence on the ascription of moral\nresponsibility, but several authors have stressed that moral\nresponsibility cannot be properly understood without recognizing the\nactive role of technology in shaping human action (Jonas 1984; Verbeek\n2006; Johnson and Powers 2005; Waelbers 2009). According to Johnson\nand Powers it is not enough to just look at what humans intend and do.\n\u201cAscribing more responsibility to persons who act with\ntechnology requires coming to grips with the behavior of the\ntechnology\u201d (2005, p. 107). One has to consider the\nvarious ways in which technological artifacts mediate human actions.\nMoral responsibility is, thus, not only about how the actions of a\nperson or a group of people affect others in a morally significant\nway; it is also about how their actions are shaped by technology.\nMoral responsibility from this perspective is not located in an\nindividual or an interpersonal relationship, but is distributed among\nhumans and technologies.\n",
