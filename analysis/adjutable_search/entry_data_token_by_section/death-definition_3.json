    "main_text": "A Progressive Alternative: The Higher-Brain Approach || Appeals to Personal Identity\n2.2 Appeals to Personal Identity\n\nA second argumentative strategy in defense of the higher-brain\napproach claims to appeal to our personal identity while remaining\nagnostic on the question of our essence (Green and Wikler 1980).\nThe fundamental claim is that, whatever we are essentially, it is\nclear that one of us has gone out of existence once the capacity for\nconsciousness has been irreversibly lost, supporting the higher-brain\nstandard of death. Clearly, though, any view of our numerical identity\nover time\u2014our persistence conditions\u2014is conceptually\ndependent on a view of what we essentially are (DeGrazia 1999;\nDeGrazia 2005, ch. 4). If we are essentially human animals, and not\nessentially beings with psychological capacities, then, contrary to\nthe above argument, it is not clear\u2014indeed, it is\nfalse\u2014that we go out of existence upon irreversible loss of the\ncapacity for consciousness; rather, we die upon the collapse of\norganismic functioning. The appeal to personal identity in support of\nthe higher-brain standard depends on the thesis that we are\nessentially minded beings and therefore inherits the challenges facing\nthis view, as discussed in the previous subsection. Nevertheless, the\nappeal to personal identity, construed as a distinct argumentative\nstrategy, was somewhat influential in early discussions of the definition of death (see, e.g., President's\nCommission 1981, 38\u20139).\n",
