Perhaps they\nsend you to a medical lab that will take a blood sample to run a\nbiochemical analysis. After the results arrive, consult with a\nphysician specialist whose expertise is the particular bodily organ or\nsystem where the ailment is localized. The specialist prescribes a\ndrug that has been mass-produced in a factory, after a biology\nlaboratory extracted the active ingredient from a natural source, or\nperhaps synthesized it from scratch. The drug\u2019s efficacy has\nbeen proven by testing the drug experimentally on two groups with the\nrelevant disease, randomly sorted into an experimental group and a\ncontrol group so that the drug\u2019s measurable bodily effects could\nbe scrutinized and counted. This is biomedicine. It has quickly grown\nto be so pervasive around the globe that it is difficult to\ncharacterize biomedicine.\n",
