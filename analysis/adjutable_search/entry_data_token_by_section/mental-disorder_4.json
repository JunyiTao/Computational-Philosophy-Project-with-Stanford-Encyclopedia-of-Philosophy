    "main_text": "The Mental in Mental Disorder || The Mark of the Mental\n3.2 The Mark of the Mental\n\nIn some philosophical accounts including those stemming from\nphenomenological traditions, the mental is distinguished by particular\nfeatures: it bears a special relationship to conscious awareness, and\nto persons, for example, or may be taken to exhibit the distinctive\n\u201caboutness\u201d or intentionality exclusive to mental\nattitudes (see\n \u00a75).\n Similarly, some theorizing emphasizes the reasons-responsiveness of\nall human thought and action, by which disorder can alone be explained\nand understood (Campbell 2013; Thornton 2007; Summers &\nSinnott-Armstrong 2019).\n\nExplanations in cognitive psychology have taken several different\nforms over the years: information processing models, which themselves\nwere made up of computational processes and representations;\nconnectionist networks; and, more recently, directly neural accounts.\nMoreover, philosophical reconstructions of cognitive psychology and\ncognitive science must be distinguished from the cognitive psychology\npracticed by psychologists\u2014although little discussion of\n\u201cthe mental\u201d occurs in either. Instead, focus is on the\ncognitive when, as was pointed out earlier, the\n\u201ccognitive\u201d subsumes capacities, states, and processes\nthat used to be considered non-cognitive, such as sensations and\nemotions. Widespread acceptance of these shifts in much theoretical\nand research writing on mental disorder has gone some way toward\neclipsing more philosophical concepts of mind and the mental, even\nthough commonsense cognitive capacities, which are understood to\ninvolve intentionality, remain the starting point of the research\nprogram of cognitive science, and branches of cognitive psychology and\ncognitive neuroscience address traditionally \u201cmental\u201d\nprocesses such as reasoning and consciousness.\n\nThe focus of cognitive psychology usually lies with computation and\nrepresentation. Mental/cognitive states (representations) depict\nfeatures of the outside world (as well as other mental states and\nabstract entities), and mental/cognitive processes operate on those\ninner symbols, transforming and manipulating them (see Von Eckardt\n1993; Friedenberg & Silverman 2011; Cratsley & Samuels 2013,\nand the\n entry on Cognitive Science).\n Although demarcated by the faculties known as \u201cmental\u201d,\nthe realm of the cognitive is typically construed as properties or\nprocesses with a causal role in determining behavior, or behavioral\ncapacities, that offer no resistance to naturalistic characterization\n(Chalmers 1996). Candidates for a distinctive \u201cmark of the\ncognitive\u201d are debated\u2014but so is the need for one ( see\nVarga 2018; Allen 2017).\n",
