    "main_text": "Strength of Evidence || Probative Value of Specific Items of Evidence\n3.1 Probative Value of Specific Items of Evidence\n\nIn reaching the verdict, the trier of fact has to assess the probative\nvalue of the individual items of evidence which have been received at\nthe trial. The concept of probative value can also play a role at the\nprior stage (which was the focus in\n section 2)\n where the judge has to make a ruling on whether to receive the\nevidence in the first place. In many legal systems, if the judge finds\nthe probative value of a proposed item of evidence to be low and\nsubstantially outweighed by countervailing considerations, such as the\nrisk of causing unfair prejudice or confusion, the judge can refuse to\nlet the jury hear or see the evidence (see, e.g., Rule 403 of the\nUnited States\u2019 Federal Rules of Evidence).\n\nThe concept of probative value (or, as it is also called, probative\nforce) is related to the concept of relevance.\n Section 2.1.2\n above introduced and examined the claim that the likelihood ratio is\nthe measure of relevance. To recapitulate, the likelihood of an item\nof evidence, E (in our previous example, the likelihood of a\nblood type match) given a hypothesis H (that the accused is\nin fact guilty) is compared with the likelihood of E given\nthe negation of H (that the accused is in fact innocent).\nPrior to the introduction of E, one may have formed some\nbelief about H based on other evidence that one already has.\nThis prior belief does not affect the likelihood ratio since its\ncomputation is based on the alternative assumptions that H is\ntrue and that H is false (Kaye 1986a; Kaye and Koehler 2003;\ncf. Davis and Follette 2002 and 2003). Rulings on relevance are\nmade by the judge when objections of irrelevance\nare raised in the course of the trial. The relevance of\nan item of evidence is supposedly assessed on its own, without\nconsideration of other evidence, and, indeed, much of the other\nevidence may have yet to presented at the point when the judge\nrules on the relevance of a particular item of\nevidence (Mnookin 2013:\n 1544\u20135).[12]\n\nProbative value, as with relevance, has been explained in terms of the\nlikelihood ratio (for detailed examples, see Nance and Morris 2002;\nFinkelstein and Levin 2003). It was noted earlier that evidence is\neither relevant or not, and, on the prevailing understanding, it is\nrelevant so long as the likelihood ratio deviates from 1:1. But\nevidence can be more or less probative depending on the value of the\nlikelihood ratio. In our earlier example, the probative value of a\nblood type match was 1.0:0.5 (or 2:1) as 50% of the suspect population\nhad the same blood type as the accused. But suppose the blood type is\nless common and only 25% of the suspect population has it. The\nprobative value of the evidence is now 1.0:0.25 (or 4:1). In both\ncases, the evidence is relevant; but the probative value is greater in\nthe latter than in the former scenario. It is tempting to describe\nprobative value as the degree of relevance but this would be\nmisleading as relevance in law is a binary concept.\n\nThere is a second way of thinking about probative value. On the second\nview, but not on the first, the probative value of an item of evidence\nis assessed contextually. The probative value of E may be low\ngiven one state of the other evidence and substantial given a\ndifferent body of other evidence (Friedman 1986; Friedman and Park\n2003; cf. Davis and Follette 2002, 2003). Where the other evidence\nshows that a woman had died from falling down an escalator at a mall\nwhile she was out shopping, her husband\u2019s history of spousal\nbattery is unlikely to have any probative value in proving that he was\nresponsible for her death. But where the other evidence shows that the\nwife had died of injuries in the matrimonial home, and the question is\nwhether the injuries were sustained from an accidental fall from the\nstairs or inflicted by the husband, the same evidence of spousal\nbattery will now have significant probative value.\n\nOn the second view, the probative value of an item of evidence\n(E) is not measured simply by the likelihood ratio as it is\non the first view. Probative value is understood as the degree to\nwhich E increases (or decreases) the probability of the\nproposition or hypothesis (H) in support of (or against)\nwhich E is led. The probative value of E is measured\nby the difference between the probability of H given\nE (the posterior probability) and the probability of\nH absent E (the prior probability) (Friedman 1986;\nJames 1941: 699).\n\nProbative value of \\(E = P(H | E) - P(H)\\)\n\n\\(P(H | E)\\) (the posterior probability) is derived by applying\nBayes\u2019 theorem\u2014that is, by multiplying the prior\nprobability by the likelihood ratio (see discussion in\n section 3.2.2\n below). On the present view, while the likelihood ratio does not\nitself measure the probative value of E, it is nevertheless a\ncrucial component in the assessment.\n\nA major difficulty with both of the mathematical conceptions of\nprobative value that we have just examined is that for most evidence,\nobtaining the figures necessary for computing the likelihood ratio is\nproblematic (Allen 1991: 380). Exceptionally, quantitative base rates\ndata exist, as in our blood type example. Where objective data is\nunavailable, the fact-finder has to draw on background experience and\nknowledge to come up with subjective values. In our blood type\nexample, a critical factor in computing the likelihood ratio was the\npercentage of the \u201csuspect population\u201d who had the same\nblood type as the accused. \u201cReference class\u201d is the\ngeneral statistical term for the role that the suspect population\nplays in this analysis. How should the reference class of\n\u201csuspect population\u201d be defined? Should we look at the\npopulation of the country as a whole or of the town or the street\nwhere the alleged murder occurred? What if it occurred at an\ninternational airport where most the people around are foreign\nvisitors? Or what if it is shown that both the accused and the victim\nwere at the time of the alleged murder inmates of the same prison?\nShould we then take the prison population as the reference class? The\ndistribution of blood types may differ according to which reference\nclass is selected. Sceptics of mathematical modelling of probative\nvalue emphasize that data from different reference classes will have\ndifferent explanatory power and the choice of the reference class is\nopen to\u2014and should be subjected to\u2014contextual argument and\nrequires the exercise of judgment; there is no a priori way of\ndetermining the correct reference class. (On the reference class\nproblem in legal factfinding, see, in addition to references cited in\nthe rest of this section, Colyvan, Regan, and Ferson 2001; Tillers\n2005; Allen and Roberts 2007.)\n\nSome writers have proposed quantifiable ways of selecting, or\nassisting in the selection, of the appropriate reference class. On one\nsuggestion, the court does not have to search for the optimal\nreference class. A general characteristic of an adversarial system of\ntrial is that the judge plays a passive role; it is up to the parties\nto come up with the arguments on which they want to rely and to\nproduce evidence in support of their respective arguments. This\nadversarial setting makes the reference class problem more manageable\nas the court need only to decide which of the reference classes relied\nupon by the parties is to be preferred. And this can be done by\napplying one of a variety of technical criteria that statisticians\nhave developed for comparing and selecting statistical models (Cheng\n2009). Another suggestion is to use the statistical method of\n\u201cfeature selection\u201d instead. The ideal reference class is\ndefined by the intersection of all relevant features of the case, and\na feature is relevant if it is correlated to the matter under enquiry\n(Franklin 2010, 2011: 559\u2013561). For instance, if the amount of\ndrug likely to be smuggled is reasonably believed to co-vary with the\nairport through which it is smuggled, the country of origin and the\ntime period, and there is no evidence that any other feature is\nrelevant on which data is available, the ideal reference class is the\nclass of drug smugglers passing through that airport originating from\nthat country and during that time period. Both suggestions have\nself-acknowledged limitations: not least, they depend on the\navailability of suitable data. Also, as Franklin stresses, while\nstatistical methods \u201chave advice to offer on how courts should\njudge quantitative evidence\u201d, they do so \u201cin a way that\nsupplements normal intuitive legal argument rather than replacing it\nby a formula\u201d (Franklin 2010: 22).\n\nThe reference class problem is not confined to the probabilistic\nassessment of the probative value of individual items of evidence. It\nis a general difficulty with a mathematical approach to legal proof.\nIn particular, the same problem arises on a probabilistic\ninterpretation of the standard of proof when the court has to\ndetermine whether the standard is met based on all the evidence\nadduced in the case. This topic is explored in\n section 3.2\n below but it is convenient at this juncture to illustrate how the\nreference class problem can also arise in this connection. Let it be\nthat the plaintiff sues Blue Bus Company to recover compensation for\ninjuries sustained in an accident. The plaintiff testifies, and the\ncourt believes on the basis of his testimony, that he was run down by\na recklessly driven bus. Unfortunately, it was dark at the time and he\ncannot tell whether the bus belonged to Blue Bus Company. Assume\nfurther that there is also evidence which establishes that Blue Bus\nCompany owns 75% of the buses in the town where the accident occurred\nand the remaining 25% is owned by Red Bus Company. No other evidence\nis presented. To use the data as the basis for inferring that there is\n0.75 probability that the bus involved in the accident was owned by\nBlue Bus Company would seem to privilege the reference class of\n\u201cbuses operating in the town\u201d over other possible\nreference classes such as \u201cbuses plying the street where the\naccident occurred\u201d or \u201cbuses operating at the time in\nquestion\u201d (Allen and Pardo 2007a: 109). Different reference\nclasses may produce very different likelihood ratios. It is crucial\nhow the reference class is chosen and this is ultimately a matter of\nargument and judgment. Any choice of reference class (other than the\nclass that shares every feature of the particular incident,\nwhich is, in effect, the unique incident itself) is in principle\ncontestable.\n\nCritics of the mathematization of legal proof raise this point as an\nexample of inherent limitations to the mathematical modelling of\nprobative value (Allen and Pardo\n 2007a).[13]\n Allen and Pardo propose an alternative, the explanatory theory of\nlegal proof. They claim that this theory has the advantage of avoiding\nthe reference class problem because it does not attempt to quantify\nprobative value (Pardo 2005: 374\u2013383; Pardo and Allen 2008: 261,\n263; Pardo 2013: 600\u2013601). Suppose a man is accused of killing\nhis wife. Evidence is produced of his extra-marital affair. The unique\nprobative value of the accused\u2019s infidelity cannot be\nmathematically computed from statistical base rates of infidelity and\nuxoricides (husbands murdering wives). In assessing its probative\nvalue, the court should look instead at how strongly the evidence of\ninfidelity supports the explanation of the material events put forward\nby the side adducing the evidence and how strongly it challenges the\nexplanation offered by the opponent. For instance, the prosecution may\nbe producing the evidence to buttress its case that the accused wanted\nto get rid of his wife so that he could marry his mistress, and the\ndefence may be advancing the alternative theory that the couple was\nunusual in that they condoned extra-marital affairs and had never let\nit affect their loving relationship. How much probative value the\nevidence of infidelity has depends on the strength of the explanatory\nconnections between it and the competing hypotheses, and this is not\nsomething that can be quantified.\n\nBut the disagreement in this debate is not as wide as it might appear.\nThe critics concede that formal models for evaluating evidence in law\nmay be useful. What they object to is\n\n\nscholarship arguing \u2026 that such models establish the correct or\naccurate probative value of evidence, and thus implying that any\ndeviations from such models lead to inaccurate or irrational outcomes.\n(Allen and Pardo 2007b: 308)\n\n\nOn the other side, it is acknowledged that there are limits to\nmathematical formalisation of evidential reasoning in law (Franklin\n2012: 238\u20139) and that context, argument and judgment do play a\nrole in identifying the reference class (Nance 2007b).\n",
