    "main_text": "Ethics\n7. Ethics\n\nOckham\u2019s ethics combines a number of themes. For one, it is a\nwill-based ethics in which intentions count for everything\nand external behavior or actions count for nothing. In themselves, all\nactions are morally neutral.\n\nAgain, there is a strong dose of divine command theory in\nOckham\u2019s ethics. Certain things (i.e., in light of the previous\npoint, certain intentions) becomes morally obligatory,\npermitted or forbidden simply because God decrees so. Thus, in Exodus,\nthe Israelites\u2019 \u201cspoiling the Egyptians\u201d (or rather\ntheir intention to do so, which they carried out) was not a\nmatter of theft or plunder, but was morally permissible and indeed\nobligatory\u2014because God had commanded it.\n\nNevertheless, despite the divine command themes in Ockham\u2019s\nethics, it is also clear that he wanted morality to be to some extent\na matter of reason. There is even a sense in which one can find a kind\nof natural law theory in Ockham\u2019s ethics; one way in which God\nconveys his divine commands to us is by giving us the natures we\n have.[47]\n Unlike Augustine, Ockham accepted the possibility of the\n\u201cvirtuous pagan\u201d; moral virtue for Ockham does not depend\non having access to revelation.\n",
