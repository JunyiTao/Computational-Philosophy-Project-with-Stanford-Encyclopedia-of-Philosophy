    "main_text": "\n\nAmong biological entities, cells are regarded as of special importance\nsince they are widely viewed as the simplest organized systems that\nare unambiguously alive. Although one can debate about entities such\nas viruses, there is little debate that cells are living. Cells\nperform all the activities critical to life, from metabolism to\nreproduction. All cells alive today maintain themselves far from\nthermodynamic equilibrium with their environment and are part of a\ncontinuous lineage of cell division that goes back approximately 4\nbillion years. The study of cells has required developing means of\nmaterially manipulating them and our contemporary understanding of\ncellular phenomena integrates results from a wide range of material\ninterventions. In introducing a special issue of Studies in\nHistory and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences on\nthe cell, O\u2019Malley and M\u00fcller-Wille assert \n\n\nThe cell, we suggest, is a nexus: a connection point between\ndisciplines, methods, technologies, concepts, structures and\nprocesses. Its importance to life, and to the life sciences and\nbeyond, is because of this remarkable position as a nexus, and because\nof the cell\u2019s apparently inexhaustible potential to be found in\nsuch connective relationships. (2010: 169) \n\n\nThe examination of cell biology, in turn, is a potent nexus for\nproductive interactions between philosophers, historians, and social\nscientists, each of whom raises questions about the study of cells\nrelevant to the others.\n\nDuring the period when philosophy of science focused primarily on\nlaws, cell biology was largely neglected. Although it is important to\ncell biologists to discover useful generalizations, these are seldom\ncharacterized as laws. Once philosophers of science turned their\nattention from laws to mechanisms, from representational realism to\nmodels and their functionality, and from concepts and theories to\nexperiments and instrumentation, more philosophers of science have\nturned their attention to the practices of cell biology. These\npractices are epistemically challenging. Due to the fact that cells\nare mostly microscopic, they raise traditional philosophical issues\nconcerning the status of unobservables and the trustworthiness of\nevidence. Since a major concern of cell biology is to relate functions\n(e.g., biochemical reactions) to cell structures, cell biologists need\nnot just to observe but also to physically manipulate cells and their\nconstituent structures and to develop informative representations.\nTheir activities thus provide rich examples for philosophers. Although\na great deal of cell biology has yet to be tapped for philosophical\nanalysis, we provide examples in which philosophers (as well as\nhistorians) have investigated and analyzed material practices in cell\nbiology. We start, however, closer to theoretical interests, examining\nhow the discipline of cell biology developed and how metaphors have\nplayed crucial roles in shaping how scientists have conceptualized\ncells. Subsequently we turn to controversies over whether cells can be\nunderstood mechanistically or require a vitalist or holist\nperspective. After that, we turn to questions of epistemology,\nincluding strategies for representing cells visually and for\ndeveloping mechanistic accounts of cell functioning.\n",
