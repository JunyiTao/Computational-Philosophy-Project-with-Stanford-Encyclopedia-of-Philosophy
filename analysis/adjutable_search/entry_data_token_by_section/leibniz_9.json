    "main_text": "Some Fundamental Principles of Leibniz's Philosophy || Principle of Continuity\n3.6 Principle of Continuity\n\n\nAccording to Leibniz, there are \u201ctwo famous labyrinths where\nour reason very often goes astray\u201d (G VI 29/H 53). The first\nconcerns human freedom, the latter the composition of the continuum.\nLeibniz, however, thought that he had found the way out of each\nlabyrinth, and his solution to the problem of the continuum is related\nultimately to a maxim or law that he\nemploys not only in his mathematical writings but also in his\nmetaphysics. As he puts it in the Preface to the New Essays,\n\u201cNothing takes place suddenly, and it is one of my great and best\nconfirmed maxims that nature never makes leaps\u201d (A VI\nvi 56/RB 56). More exactly, Leibniz believes that this law or principle\nimplies that any change passes through some intermediate change and\nthat there is an actual infinity in things. The Principle of Continuity\nwill be employed to show that no motion can arise from a state of\ncomplete rest and that \u201cnoticeable perceptions arise by degrees\nfrom ones which are too minute to be noticed\u201d (ibid.).\n",
