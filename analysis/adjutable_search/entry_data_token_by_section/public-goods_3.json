    "main_text": "Defining Public Goods and Distinguishing Between Different Kinds of Public Goods || Examples of Public Goods\n1.4 Examples of Public Goods\n\nThe following are examples of goods that are typically regarded as\npublic goods:\n\n Security. National defence has already been mentioned as\nan example. More generally, the ability to live safely and peacefully\nin a neighbourhood, city, region, or country (for instance, through\npolice and armed forces) is considered a public good because it is\ndifficult to exclude any inhabitant of the protected area from\nbenefitting from the protection and one inhabitant\u2019s enjoyment\nof protection does not generally diminish other inhabitants\u2019\nequal enjoyment.\n Education and science. The public goods character of\neducation and science is somewhat more subtle. It is easily possible\nto exclude individuals from being schooled, and so \u201chaving an\nMIT engineering degree\u201d is a private good. However, the more\neducated the general population is, the more individuals benefit from\nthis general education\u2014independently of how much they invest (or\nthe public invests) in their own education\u2014in a manner that is\nnon-excludable and non-rivalrous. A better educated population makes\nit easier for businesses to thrive, and everybody profits from a\nthriving economy, not only those who are well-educated. It is\ndifficult to exclude individuals from a thriving economy and a given\nindividual\u2019s benefit is not diminished by anybody else\u2019s\nbenefit. Scientific ideas are also considered to be public goods\n(Boldrin & Levine 2008). Once an idea (such as a scientific\ntheory) has been created it is difficult to exclude individuals from\nbenefitting (unless the idea is protected by a patent, see below), and\nindividuals\u2019 benefit is non-rivalrous. It is important to\ndistinguish between the idea and its physical manifestation. The idea\nof a steam engine is a public good, whereas particular steam engines\nare both excludable and rivalrous.\n Infrastructure. Though infrastructure is often referred\nto as a public good (e.g., OECD 2016), whether the classification is\ncorrect depends on the details of the specific kind of infrastructure\nand technology. Paradigmatic examples of infrastructure are often not\npublic goods. Roads and motorways are excludable, as the existence of\ntoll roads attests. If the toll for a private road is sufficiently\nlow, it can be rivalrous as well due to congestion. The same can be\nsaid about the internet. A traditional lighthouse is more likely to\nhave public-goods character, though depending on the physical nature\nof the signal it sends, it may well be excludable (Varian 1992: 415).\nThe reason many commentators classify infrastructure as a public good\nis that it tends to lead to positive externalities. The (close)\nrelationship between public goods and externalities is explained\nbelow.\n Environment. Clean air is a paradigmatic good, at least\noutside. Without massive infringements of an individual's rights it is\nvirtually impossible to exclude him or her from benefitting from clean\nair. And outside of narrowly enclosed spaces, clean air is non-rival.\nSimilarly with the absence of littering. If I decide not to litter, I\ncannot easily prevent you from enjoying the clean space, and your\nenjoyment of it does not reduce anyone else\u2019s.\n Public health. Individuals benefit from a healthy\npopulation in a variety of ways. For example, the fewer individuals\nare infected with a contagious disease, the less likely it is that any\ngiven (currently healthy) infects him- or herself. These benefits\nobtain in a non-excludable and non-rivalrous manner. A healthier\npopulation is also more likely to be productive, making public health\nanalogous to education.\n\n",
