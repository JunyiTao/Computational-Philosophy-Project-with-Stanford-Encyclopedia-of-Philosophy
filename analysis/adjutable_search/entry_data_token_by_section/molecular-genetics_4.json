    "main_text": "Was classical genetics reduced to molecular genetics?\n3. Was classical genetics reduced to molecular genetics?\n\n\nPhilosophers of science have been intrigued by ideals of\nreductionism and the grand scheme that all science will one day be\n\u201creduced\u201d to a universal science of\nfundamental physics (see the entry on\n inter-theory relations in physics)\n for philosophical and scientific concepts of reductionism in the\ncontext of physical science). Philosophical reductionists believe that\nscientific knowledge progresses when higher-level sciences\n(e.g., chemistry) are reduced to lower-level sciences\n(e.g., physics). The so-called received view of scientific\nknowledge, codified in Nagel (1961) and Hempel (1966), promoted\nreductionism as a central ideal for science, and confidently asserted\nthat much progress had been made in the reduction of chemistry to\nphysics. Nagel constructed a formal model of reduction and applied it\nto illuminate how the science of thermodynamics, which was couched in\nterms of higher-level concepts such as pressure and temperature, was\nallegedly reduced to statistical mechanics, couched in terms of the\nlower-level concepts of Newtonian dynamics such as force and mean\nkinetic energy. In 1969, Schaffner claimed that the same kind of\nadvance was now taking place in genetics, and that the science of\nclassical genetics was being reduced to an emerging science of\n\u201cmolecular genetics.\u201d Schaffner's claim, however, was\nquickly challenged by Hull. Other philosophers of biology developed\nHull's anti-reductionist arguments and a near consensus developed that\nclassical genetics was not and would not be reduced to molecular\ngenetics. Although the philosophical case for anti-reductionism has\nbeen challenged, many philosophers still assume that the\nanti-reductionist account of genetics provides an exemplar for\nanti-reductionist analyses of other sciences.\n",
