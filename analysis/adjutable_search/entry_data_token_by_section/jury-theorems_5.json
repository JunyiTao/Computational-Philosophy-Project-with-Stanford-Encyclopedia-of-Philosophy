    "main_text": "Three Jury Theorems || Partial solution: the Conditional Jury Theorem\n2.3 Partial solution: the Conditional Jury Theorem\n\nDependencies between votes can be \u201cconditionalised away\u201d.\nGiven the common causes\u2014the shared evidence,\netc.\u2014votes no longer exhibit dependence, as they no longer carry\nnew information about common causes, hence about one another.\nConditionalisation blocks the information flow through common causes.\nThese considerations apply a well-known principle: causally\nindependent phenomena are probabilistically independent conditional on\ntheir common causes (Reichenbach 1956).\n\nThe conditionalisation strategy assumes that votes do not influence\none another, i.e., are causally independent, as in secret\nvoting. Otherwise information can flow between votes\ndirectly, not just via common causes, and conditionalising on\ncommon causes fails to make votes probabilistically independent.\n\nTo implement conditionalisation, introduce a random variable\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\), called the facts, on which to conditionalise.\nOne could interpret the facts as the totality of common causes, but\nsimpler interpretations are also possible. The facts could be some\nproxy of common causes. Most commonly, \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is the fact\ndetermining the correct alternative. This correct-making fact is\nstandardly called the state (of the world). In a\ncourt\u2019s convict-or-acquit decision, its possible values could be\n\u201cguilty\u201d and \u201cinnocent\u201d, which make\n\u201cconvict\u201d or \u201cinnocent\u201d correct, respectively.\n Section 2.1,\n Section 4.1 and\n Section 5.1\n discuss the state.\n\nThe new jury theorem will therefore rest on the following\nprimitives.\n\nPrimitives of the Conditional Jury Theorem: correctness\nevents \\(R_{1},\\) \\(R_{2}, \\ldots\\) and an arbitrary random variable\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (the facts variable, representing for instance\nthe state or the common causes), all defined relative to a probability\nspace.\n\nConvention: Definitions involving \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) will assume\nthat each value of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) has positive probability (which\nfacilitates conditionalising, but restricts attention to discrete\nrather than continuous \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)). All definitions could be\n generalised.[7]\n\nThese are the revised premises and theorem.\n\nConditional Independence (CI). The individual\ncorrectness events \\(R_{1},\\) \\(R_{2}, \\ldots\\) are independent given\nany value \\(x\\) of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\n\nConditional Competence (CC). For any value \\(x\\) of\nthe facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), the conditional correctness probability\n\\(P(R_{i}|x)\\)\u2014the specific competence on\n\\(x\\)\u2014exceeds \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and is the same for all\nindividuals \\(i\\).\n\nConditional Jury Theorem: Assuming CI and CC, the\nprobability of majority correctness, \\(P(\\Maj_{n})\\), increases in\n (odd[8])\n group size \\(n\\) and converges to 1.\n\nThis theorem reaches the same optimistic conclusions as\nCondorcet\u2019s theorem, but based on new premises. The new\nindependence assumption is more plausible to the extent that the facts\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\) include common causes or proxies thereof. If the facts\nare the state of the world\u2014a very rough proxy of common\ncauses\u2014one obtains the literature\u2019s most common form of\nconditionalisation and the classical State-Conditional Jury\nTheorem (e.g., Austen-Smith & Banks 1996). The Conditional Jury\nTheorem generalises this familiar jury theorem to an arbitrary target\nof conditionalisation \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Replacing\nstate-conditionalisation by arbitrary conditionalisation makes the\njury theorem more flexible, opening the door to genuinely plausible\nindependence assumptions.\n\nHow has the competence assumption evolved? Conditional Competence is\nlogically stronger than Unconditional Competence: individuals must\noutperform fair coins not just globally, but given any facts. For\ninstance, in a court\u2019s decision to convict or acquit, where the\nfacts are the state of guilt or innocence, each individual (judge)\nmust be more likely correct than incorrect given guilt and also given\ninnocence.\n\nAn individual \\(i\\)\u2019s general competence is expressible as his\n(probability-weighted) average specific competence across possible\nfacts, i.e., possible values \\(x\\) of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\):\n\n\n\\[\\tag{1} P(R_{i})=\\sum_{x}P(R_{i}|x)P(x). \\]\n\n\n\nThis shows that CC implies UC.\n\nUnfortunately, the Conditional Jury Theorem maintains the unrealistic\nconclusion of asymptotic infallibility. Conditionalisation on facts\ncan repair the independence premise, but another problem in the\npremises remains, as will now be explained.\n",
