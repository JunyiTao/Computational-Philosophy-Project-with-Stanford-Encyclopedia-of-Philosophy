    "main_text": "Physical cartesianism and the consequences of metaphysical divergence || Areas of agreement and divergence\n3.1 Areas of agreement and divergence\n\nSpinoza agrees with the Cartesian conception of body as res\nextensa (Latin, extended thing), i.e., things necessarily and\nexhaustively conceived through\n extension.[1]\n He was, like Descartes, a plenist, rejecting the intelligibility of a\nvacuum. Furthermore, we know from Spinoza's correspondence that he\naccepted nearly all of Descartes' kinematic views, that is, the laws\nhe articulated describing the course of physical phenomena.\nHe likewise agrees with Descartes that physical nature should not be\nconceived as a teleological system, and that appeals to final causes\nshould be banished from physical theory.\n\nYet Spinoza had substantial disagreements with Descartes over a wide\nrange of metaphysical issues that bear on physical theory. Most\nobviously, he rejected Descartes' dualism of extended and mental\nsubstances in favor of substance monism, and correspondingly rejected\nCartesian mind-body interactionism. Some of these metaphysical\ndisagreements penetrate right to the grounds of the physical views the\ntwo thinkers share, revealing much of their agreement to be quite\nsuperficial. Consider, for example, their shared rejection of appeals\nto final causes in physics. Descartes held that final causal or\nteleological thinking is useless in physics, not because physical\nnature is not in fact teleological, but because our finite\nunderstanding cannot hope to understand the divine will, hence cannot\ngrasp the purposes with which physical nature is imbued. For Spinoza,\nin contrast, the problem is not epistemological but metaphysical. The\ndivine cause of the world has no will, and does not create things with\na plan in mind (1p32c, p33d, s2); hence nature is simply not a\nteleological system at all.\n\nSpinoza's agreement with the Cartesian laws of nature and collision\nprovides a telling set of further examples. Spinoza explicated and\nelaborated on these at length and in detail in the PCP.\nInterpreting this work as an expression of Spinoza's own thinking is a\ndelicate matter, since its explicit aim is to present and explicate\nDescartes' views, not Spinoza's own. Despite this, the PCP\nprovides a number of indications of where Spinoza diverges from\nDescartes on the metaphysical foundations of physics. In particular,\nthe demonstrations Spinoza offers of most of the basic principles of\nCartesian physics are often significantly different from or\nsupplementary to Descartes' own, and seem to presage important\nelements of Spinoza's mature thought as expressed in the\nEthics.\n\nOne such supplement involves Spinoza's attempt to extend the range of\napplication of Descartes' collision rules. Descartes' collision rules\nare limited in scope to the special case of bodies moving along a\nsingle line. In a scholium following a corollary Spinoza adds to\nDescartes' third rule, Spinoza explains that the vexed Cartesian term\n\u201cdeterminatio\u201d (determination) signifies not just\nthe direction of a motion, but also a force of motion along that\ndirection (PCP IIp27s). He then attempts to demonstrate how\nthe Cartesian collision laws can be extended to oblique collisions, by\nshowing how this force can be resolved into components by the rule of\nparallelograms. Spinoza's confused attempt fails, but this failure is\nnot of much interest on its own. Given that the oblique case is surely\nmore ordinary than the collinear case, and given that generality of\napplication is something one would surely want in collision laws, what\nis interesting is why Descartes did not himself attempt to provide\nrules of more general coverage, and why Spinoza felt that he had to do\nso.\n\nA plausible answer lies in a difference in their views as to the\ndegree and way in which physical nature forms a closed system.\nDescartes held that quantity of motion, conceived as the product of\nspeed and bulk, is conserved in all physical\n interactions.[2]\n This view allowed him to hold that mental substances can interact\nwith bodies and influence their motions, so long as they influence\nonly their direction. But given such influence, there can be no fully\ngeneral physical laws covering collisions. The precise state of a\nphysical system for Descartes cannot be determined by its prior state\nplus the laws of\n nature.[3]\n In this sense Descartes was not a physical determinist. Given that\nthe possible intrusion of extra-physical influence precludes fully\ngeneral collision laws, Descartes might not have thought it worthwhile\nto puzzle too much over the formulation of laws concerning non-linear\nmotion, thinking it sufficient to illustrate the application of the\nprinciples governing interaction only in the simplest cases.\n\nSpinoza emphatically rejected Cartesian interactionism. For him,\nextended nature is an entirely closed system. All the determinations\nof body, including not just quantity of motion but also direction, are\nwholly accounted for by the causal determination of other bodies,\ncombined with the nature of the body in question. Spinoza makes this\nquite clear in Ip28:\n\nEvery singular thing, or any thing which is finite and has a\ndeterminate existence, can neither exist nor be determined to produce\nan effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an effect by\nanother cause, which is also finite and has a determinate existence\n\u2026 and so on, to infinity.\n\n\nSince modes of distinct attributes cannot cause or explain one\nanother, and since God is the cause of modes only insofar as he is\nconsidered to be affected by another thing under the attribute of\nwhich they are modes (IIp6, IIp9), it follows that every determination\nof an extended thing results from the exclusive determining operations\nof other extended things. In this light, Spinoza should have felt more\nacutely than Descartes the need for a set of collision laws of fully\ngeneral application.\n\nUnbeknownst to him this need could only be met effectively by the\nrejection of Descartes' conservation law. Spinoza nowhere calls this\nlaw explicitly into question, and his acceptance of Descartes'\ncollision laws strongly suggests that he did in fact accept it. But he\ncannot have accepted the metaphysical grounds Descartes offers for it.\nFor Descartes, substances are dependent for their existence at every\nmoment upon God's concurrent creative activity, and since God's will\nis constant, he always recreates the whole of the extended world with\nexactly the same quantity of motion as he put there in the beginning.\nEach and every one of Descartes' laws of motion is for him\nmetaphysically grounded in the immutability of the divine will. But\nSpinoza's God has no will, and the world is not a product of creation,\nin the sense in which creation follows from a decision to act in\naccord with a conception formed in the understanding. Spinoza's own\ncommitment to rationalism nonetheless demands that there be some\nreason for the conservation of motion.\n",
