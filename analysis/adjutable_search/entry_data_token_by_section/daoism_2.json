    "main_text": "Impact of the School of Names\n5. Impact of the School of Names\n\nOne stark difference between the two main texts of Daoism is the\nrelation to the School of Names. The Laozi, though clearly\nhaving a theory of the pragmatics of naming, betrays neither exposure\nto the doctrines nor the analytical terminology developed by the\ndialectical Mohists for dealing with theory of language. The\nZhuangzi clearly does reveal that exposure. To understand\nthis phase in the development of Daoism, we note briefly what the\noutstanding linguistic issues were and how they were formulated, then\nwe will look at the implications of Daoist\nresponses\u2014particularly those found in the Zhuangzi.\n\n\nThe focus on mingwords:names\ngrows from recognizing the\ninterpretive problem concerning acting on some guide. The disputes\nabout dao are intimately tied to issues about words\u2014in\nparticular, what is to count as a correct use and what action or\nobjects count as following the guidance.\n\nThe early Mohists advocated using a utilitarian standard to determine\nboth the correct application of words to actions and the choice of\nword order in social guiding discourse. \u201cWhich dao\nshould we follow\u201d became \u201cwhich words shall we use to\nsocialize people and how should we interpret the words of social\nguiding discourse in guiding our behavior?\u201d In effect, the early\nMohist answer to both questions is settled by making allegedly\n\u201cnatural\u201d distinctions between benefit and harm. Thus\nlanguage content and conventions of interpretation should be governed\nby the utility principle.\n\nLater Mohists formulated a more \u201crealistic\u201d theory of what\ncounts as the normatively correct way to use names. We should mark the\ndistinctions that underlie names in ways that trace patterns of\nobjective similarity and difference in things. This realism governs\nthe correct ways both to use terms and to interpret them. We rely on\nutility to determine how we structure terms into strings in\nguidance\u2014in discourse dao . So, for example, a thief is\na man\u2014is governed by the rules of similarity. Still, we allow\nguidance that includes both the guiding strings \u201cdon\u2019t kill\nmen\u201d and \u201cyou may kill thieves.\u201d \n\nThis realism led the later Mohists to linguistic conclusions that\nchallenged any anti-language attitude\u2014including those expressed\nby early Daoists. First, the later Mohists argued that in any\ndisagreement about how to distinguish realities with names, there was\na right answer. It may, however, be hard to know or prove. So, for\nexample, if we are disputing about whether to use \u201cox\u201d or\n\u201cnon-ox\u201d of some obscure object, one of the answers will\nbe correct. This undermines both the nihilistic and the anti-language\noptions to understanding Laozi. Second, Mohists argued that any\nattempt to formulate the anti-language position was self condemning.\n\u201cAll language is bad\u201d must be a \u201cbad\u201d thing to\nsay.\n\nOther figures classified in the School of Names responded to the\nMohist realists. Gongsun Long (mentioned sporadically in the\nZhuangzi) took himself to be defending Confucian accounts of\nrectifying names and Hui Shi constructs what looks like a relativist\nchallenge to Later Mohist accounts. We will look only at Hui Shi\u2019s\naccount here because he plays such a significant role in the text of\nthe Zhuangzi .\n\nHui Shi implicitly addressed the claim that the correct use of words\ndepends on objective patterns of similarity and difference. What we\nknow of his writings (which the Zhuangzi history suggests\nwere prodigious) is mainly a sequence of theses cited at the end of\nthe Zhuangzi history. These focused on propositions about\ncomparative \u201cnames\u201d\u2014e.g., large and small. Clearly\nsome things properly termed \u2018large\u2019 are objectively\nsmaller than other things properly called \u2018small\u2019. A small\nelephant is considerably larger than a huge ant! So correct naming\nmust not be based on objective distinctions in the world, but on our\nprojections from a point of view or purpose in using them. Similarly,\n\u2018tall\u2019, \u2018short\u2019, and time words (e.g.,\n\u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019, \u2018today\u2019 and\n\u2018tomorrow\u2019) are implausibly attributed to objective\ndistinctions\n\nFrom this, according to the list of propositions in the\nZhuangzi history, Hui Shi apparently concluded that we can\ncluster things in arbitrary ways. This insight is not taken to be\nabout sets and members, but about divisions into parts and wholes. So\nwe can speak of a great \u201cone\u201d that is a kind of everything\nconcept\u2014nothing lies outside it and of a small \u201cone\u201d\nwhich cannot be further distinguished or divided. Objectively there\nare no distinctions\u2014the cosmos is one, and we should direct the\nsame guiding attitudes toward the whole\u2014\u201clove all things\nequally.\u201d\n",
