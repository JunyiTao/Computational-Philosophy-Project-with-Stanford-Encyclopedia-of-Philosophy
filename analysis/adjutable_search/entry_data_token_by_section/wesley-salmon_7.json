    "main_text": "Space and Time\n4. Space and Time\n\nSalmon took an interest in the philosophy of space and time while\nattending Reichenbach\u2019s courses as a graduate student at UCLA,\nand continued working on the topic for many years. His first\npublication in the field was the collection of essays Zeno\u2019s\nParadoxes (1970a), including contributions by Abner Shimony,\nBertrand Russell, Henri Bergson, Max Black, J.O. Wisdom, James\nThomson, Paul Benacerraf, G.E.L. Owen, and Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum, plus a\nlong introduction and an appendix on \u201cSets and Infinity\u201d\nby Salmon himself. As stated at the beginning of the introduction,\nSalmon\u2019s goal in bringing together the essays forming the\ncollection was systematic rather than historical. His motivation lay\nin the conviction that after a long period in which Zeno\u2019s\nparadoxes had been regarded as mere sophisms, from the middle of the\nNineteenth and even more in the Twentieth century they had become the\nfocus of sophisticated philosophical discussion. The articles included\nin the book tackle five of Zeno\u2019s arguments, namely four\nparadoxes of motion and the paradox of plurality. At the heart of the\nparadoxes lies the problem of defining the notions of continuum and\ninfinity. According to Salmon, such paradoxes cannot be solved in\npurely logical or mathematical terms because \u201cit is also\nnecessary to show how the abstract mathematical system can be used for\nthe description of concrete physical reality\u201d (Salmon 1970a:\n16). It is worth noting that one of the chapters consists of a few\npages taken from Russell\u2019s Our Knowledge of the External\nWorld (1929) outlining his at-at theory of motion, which later\nplayed a key role within Salmon\u2019s theory of causal processes\n(see\n \u00a7 5.5.2).\n\nIn 1975 Salmon published a second book called Space, Time and\nMotion: A Philosophical Introduction (1975a) which contains a\nmasterly introduction to the topic. The four chapters of the book lead\nthe non-specialist reader through the essentials of the philosophy of\nspace and time from non-Euclidean geometries and Zeno\u2019s\nparadoxes to special relativity and simultaneity. The book, which\npresupposes only an elementary background knowledge of geometry and\nmathematics on the part of the reader, is meant as an invitation to\npursue the topics addressed in a more systematic and specialized way.\nSalmon fully achieved this purpose, whose treatment of thorny subjects\nsucceeded in being both \u201cscientifically sound\u201d and\n\u201cintuitive and easy\u201d (Salmon 1988c: 276).\n\nSalmon addressed simultaneity in other writings, including the article\n\u201cThe Philosophical Significance of the One-Way Speed of\nLight\u201d (1977c) which contains a defense of simultaneity\u2019s\nconventionality, dating back to Einstein and argued for in detail by\nReichenbach (1928 [1957]). After surveying a number of experimental\nmethods devised for the measurement of the speed of light, from\nGalileo to J. Bradley, H.L. Fizeau, and J.L. Foucault, Salmon went on\nto discuss synchrony, arguing that a conventional element is involved\nin all of such accounts. Since simultaneity rests on synchrony and\nultimately on the one way speed of light, by showing that the latter\ncannot be ascertained experimentally Salmon intended to \u201cgive\nsubstance to the abstract conventionality issue\u201d (Salmon 1977c:\n255), namely to Einstein\u2019s claim that the relation between the\nspeed of light in two different directions is not a matter that can be\nestablished empirically, but only by convention.\n\nFurther reading: For a classical introduction to the\nphilosophy of space and time see Gr\u00fcnbaum 1973. For a more recent\naccount see Malament 2012. A collection of essays on the key problems\nof the philosophy of physics is contained in Batterman (ed.) 2013. An\noverview of the debate on the topic is to be found in Huggett, Nick,\nCarl Hoefer, and James Read, 2022.\n",
