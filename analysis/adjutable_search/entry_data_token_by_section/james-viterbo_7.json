    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Individuation\n3.4 Individuation\n\nJames discusses individuation in two places: Quodl. I, q. 21\nand Quodl. II, q. 1. I will focus on the first treatment,\nbecause it is the lengthier of the two and because the tenor of\nJames\u2019 brief remarks on individuation in Quodl. II, q.\n1, despite certain similarities with his earlier discussion (Wippel\n1994), make it hard to see how they fit into an overall theory of\nindividuation.\n\nThe question James faces in Quodl. I, q. 21 is a markedly\ntheological one, namely whether, if the soul were to take on the ashes\nor the matter of another man at resurrection, the resulting individual\nwould be the same as before resurrection. In order to answer that\nquestion, James tells us, it is first necessary to determine what the\ncause of numerical unity is in the case of composite beings. There\nhave been numerous answers to that question and James provides a short\naccount of each. Some philosophers have appealed to quantity as the\nprinciple of numerical unity; others to matter; others yet to matter\nas subtending indeterminate dimensions; finally, others have turned to\nform as the cause of individuation. According to James, each of these\nanswers is part of the correct explanation though each is insufficient\nif taken on its own. The correct view, according to him, is that form\nand matter taken together are the principal causes of numerical\nidentity in the composite, with quantity contributing something\n\u201cin a certain manner.\u201d Form and matter, however, are\nprincipal causes in different ways; more precisely, each accounts for\na different kind of numerical unity. For by \u2018singularity\u2019\nwe can really mean two distinct things: we can mean the mere fact of\nsomething\u2019s being this or that singular thing, or we can point\nto a thing qua \u201csomething complete and perfect within a certain\nspecies\u201d (Quodl. I, 21, 227, 134\u201335). It is\nmatter that accounts for the first kind of singularity, and form for\nthe second. Put otherwise, the kind of unity that accrues to a thing\non account of its being a mere singular results from the concurrence\nof the \u201csubstantial\u201d unity provided by matter and the\n\u201caccidental\u201d unity provided by quantity. By contrast, the\nunity that characterizes a thing by virtue of the perfection or\ncompleteness it displays is conferred to it by the form, which is the\nprinciple of perfection and actuality in composites.\n\nAlthough James thinks he can quite legitimately enlist the support of\nsuch prestigious authorities as Aristotle and Averroes in favor of the\nview that matter and form together are constitutive of a thing\u2019s\nnumerical unity, his solution has struck commentators as a somewhat\ncontrived and ad hoc attempt to reach a compromise solution at all\ncosts (Pickav\u00e9 2007; Wippel 1994). James, it has been\nsuggested, \u201cseems to be driven by the desire to offer a\ncompromise position with which everyone can to some extent\nagree\u201d (Pickav\u00e9 2007: 55). Such a suggestion does accord\nwith James\u2019 oft-expressed preference for solutions that present\na \u201cmiddle way\u201d (media via) among competing\ntheories (Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, q. 11, p.\n23, 513; Quodl. II, q. 7, p. 108, 118; De regimine\nchristiano, 210; see also Quodl. II, q. 5, p. 65,\n208\u2013209), although these professions of moderation must\nsometimes be taken with a grain of salt, as we will see in\n Section 8\n below.\n",
