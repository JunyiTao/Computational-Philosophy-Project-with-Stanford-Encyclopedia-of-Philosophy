    "main_text": "The Structural Equations Framework || SEF and Chancy Causation\n5.5 Defaults and Deviants\n\nIn\n \u00a74\n we saw two examples of the kinds of case that have motivated some\nauthors to endorse contextualism. The examples exhibit different\nfeatures. In the case of the theft of the coconut cake, the idea is\nthat in different contexts of utterance, the very same causal claim\n\u2013 \u201cSuzy\u2019s theft of the coconut cake from the shop\ncaused her subsequent illness\u201d \u2013 can vary in truth value,\ndepending on whether the context determines that what is at issue is\nSuzy\u2019s criminality (theft rather than purchase) or, instead,\nwhich item she stole (coconut cake rather than Bath bun). The case of\nthe gardener and the Queen, by contrast, is a case where the (alleged)\ncause (the gardener\u2019s omission) and non-cause (the\nQueen\u2019s) stand in the same counterfactual relationship to the\neffect, and yet judgements differ with respect to their causal\nstatus.\n\nA major focus of the debate within the SEF approach has been the\nsecond kind of case \u2013 cases of what Menzies calls\n\u2018counterfactual isomorphs\u2019 (Menzies 2017), where two\ndifferent scenarios have isomorphic causal models and yet our\njudgements about what causes what differs in the two different\nscenarios. For example, consider a case of \u2018bogus\nprevention\u2019 (Hiddleston 2005): believing that Killer has\npreviously poisoned Victim\u2019s coffee, Bodyguard puts an antidote\ninto it. However, in fact Killer had a change of heart and\ndidn\u2019t poison the coffee. Victim survives \u2013 but his\nsurvival was not, surely, caused by Bodyguard\u2019s action, for\nthere was no threat to Victim\u2019s life that Bodyguard neutralized.\nIt is possible, however, to construct a causal model of this case that\nis isomorphic to a standard case of symmetric overdetermination: Billy\nand Suzy are throwing rocks again, but this time both of their throws\nhit the bottle at the same time, so that each is sufficient for its\nshattering and neither hit pre-empts the other. In that case\n(allegedly), we identify both Billy\u2019s and Suzy\u2019s throws as\ncauses of the bottle\u2019s shattering (Blanchard and Schaffer 2017:\n185\u20136).\n\nOne broad line of response to the problem of counterfactual isomorphs\nhas been to distinguish between \u2018default\u2019 (or\n\u2018normal\u2019) and \u2018deviant\u2019 events, and to build\nthis distinction into the way in which causal information is extracted\nfrom the model. For example, Menzies\u2019 approach exploits the\nmachinery seen above with respect to Hithcock\u2019s solution to the\nproblem of symmetric overdetermination, which involves fixing\n\u2018off-path\u2019 variables at non-actual values. Menzies\u2019\nsuggestion is that we fix those variables at their \u2018most\nnormal\u2019 values, so that in effect we evaluate the relevant\ncounterfactuals from the perspective of a world where those normal\nvalues are actualised rather than from the perspective of the actual\nworld (Menzies 2004, 2007, 2009).\n\nIntuitively, the basic idea is that (in the overdetermination case)\nthe \u2018most normal\u2019 value of each of BT and ST\nis 0 (throwing rocks at bottles isn\u2019t normal!), so from the\nperspective of a world where ST = 0, BS counterfactually\ndepends on ST (and similarly for BT). So both\nBilly\u2019s and Suzy\u2019s throws count as causes of the\nbottle\u2019s shattering. Poisoning someone\u2019s coffee is also\nnot normal. So we hold Killer\u2019s failure to poison the coffee\nfixed (so in this case the \u2018most normal\u2019 world is just the\nactual world as far as the poisoning is concerned), which delivers the\nright result that Victim\u2019s survival does not counterfactually\ndepend on Bodyguard\u2019s administering the antidote. (See Hitchcock\n2007 for a different solution that trades on the default/deviant\ndistinction.)\n\nIt is hard to see, however, how there could be a univocal and\nreasonably well defined notion of \u2018normality\u2019 that would\ndeliver clear verdicts on what the \u2018normal\u2019 or\n\u2018default\u2019 values of variables are, and hence would deliver\nan objectively \u2018correct\u2019 set of models, all of which\ndeliver the same verdict for the same situation (Blanchard and\nSchaffer 2017: \u00a7\u00a72 and 3). Blanchard and Schaffer argue that\n\u2018default-relativity\u2019 does not solve some of the problems\nit was supposed to solve; more importantly, however, they argue that\nthe alleged cases of isomorphic causal models are not really genuine\ncases in the first place: they arise because one (or both) of the\nrelevant models falls foul of the independently-motivated criteria for\n\u2018aptness\u2019 (see\n \u00a75.3\n above). For example, one such criterion is that the variables not be\nallotted values \u2018that one is not willing to take\nseriously\u2019 (Hitchcock 2001: 287). But the case of the gardener\nand the Queen violates that criterion: the possibility of the Queen\nwatering my flowers is, precisely, one that we do not take seriously.\nIn other cases, they argue, the isomorphism results from deploying\n\u2018impoverished\u2019 models: models that fail to include enough\nvariables to adequately represent the \u2018essential causal\nstructure\u2019 of the situation being modelled (Blanchard and\nSchaffer 2017: \u00a73).\n\nBlanchard and Schaffer\u2019s own view is that, insofar as our causal\njudgements do exhibit something like default-relativity, this is due\nto cognitive heuristics that engender biases in our judgements.\nAlternatives to \u2018deviant\u2019 events tend to \u2018leap\nout\u2019 at us \u2013 they are salient because they are easy to\nimagine \u2013 whereas alternatives to \u2018default\u2019 events\ndon\u2019t. Blanchard and Schaffer\u2019s view can thus be seen as a\nversion of invariantism, where the kinds of case that are supposed to\nmotivate contextualism are accommodated through features of our causal\ntalk and thought that are extraneous to the (non-norm-dependent)\nconcept of causation.\n\nA host of issues remain in this area. One is whether or not we should\ndemand a uniquely \u2018correct\u2019 answer to the question of what\ncount as \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018default\u2019 values of\nvariables in the first place; perhaps, if for example there are\ndifferent dimensions of \u2018normality\u2019 (statistical\nlikelihood, consonance with moral or legal norms, etc.), we should\nembrace the idea that two apt models of the very same situation might\ndeliver different and equally correct results, depending on how the\nnormal or default values are set \u2013 which in turn would depend on\nthe context (e.g. the purpose for which the model is being\ndeployed).\n\nMore general issues that lie in the background of the debate about\n\u2018default-relativity\u2019 include whether the purpose of the\nconcept of causation is best served by an \u2018egalitarian\u2019 or\n\u2018invariantist\u2019 concept of causation or rather by one that\ntakes the concept to enshrine normative considerations. Hitchcock\n(2017), for example, argues that since our interest in what causes\nwhat is, in essence, an interest in what kinds of intervention would\nbring about the kinds of results we want, we should take the latter\nline. A still more general issue is whether there is just one concept\nof causation at which all of the accounts on the table are or should\nbe aiming, or instead several (Hall 2004, McDonnell 2018). Or perhaps\ncausation is what Nancy Cartwright (following Neurath) calls a\n\u2018Ballung\u2019 concept: \u201ca concept with rough, shifting,\nporous boundaries, a congestion of different ideas and implications\nthat can in various combinations be brought into focus for different\npurposes and in different contexts\u201d (2017: 136).\n",
