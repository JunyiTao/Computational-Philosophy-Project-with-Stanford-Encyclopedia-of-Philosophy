Nevertheless, these\nexigencies can be smothered, perhaps even silenced, by\ndespair. Such is the case in the example of the\n\u201cfunctionalized\u201d person. The broken world can smother\ntranscendent exigencies, leaving only quotidian, functional\nneeds intact. Ontological exigence, the need for\ntranscendence, is linked to a certain dissatisfaction\u2014one that\nis all the more troubling because one is unable to soothe this\ndissatisfaction by one\u2019s own powers. However, without a feeling\nthat something is amiss, without the feeling of dissatisfaction,\nontological exigence withers. This is why the functional\nperson, the person who no longer even notices that the world is\nbroken, is described as having lost the awareness of the ontological\nand the need for transcendence. In the face of this potential despair,\nMarcel claims that:\n\nBeing is\u2014or should be\u2014necessary. It is impossible that\neverything should be reduced to a play of successive appearances which\nare inconsistent with each other\u2026 or, in the words of\nShakespeare, to \u201ca tale told by an idiot.\u201d I aspire to\nparticipate in this being, in this reality\u2014and perhaps this\naspiration is already a degree of participation, however rudimentary.\n(Marcel 1995, p.\n 15)[3]\n\n\nThus, ontological exigence is a need and a demand for some\nlevel of coherence in the cosmos and for some understanding of our\nplace and role within this coherence. It is the combination of wonder\nand the attendant desire, not to understand the entire cosmos, but to\nunderstand something of one\u2019s own place in\n it.[4]\n Note that, for Marcel, ontological exigence is not merely a\n\u201cwish\u201d for being or coherence, but is an \u201cinterior\nurge\u201d or \u201cappeal.\u201d \u201cOtherwise stated, the\n[ontological] exigence is not reducible to some psychological state,\nmood, or attitude a person has; it is rather a movement of\nthe human spirit that is inseparable from being human\u201d (Keen\n1984, p. 105).\n",
