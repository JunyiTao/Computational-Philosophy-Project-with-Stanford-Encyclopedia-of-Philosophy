    "main_text": "Criticisms of Quaker defences of women || Response to criticisms\n6. Conclusion: Fell\u2019s place in history of feminism\n\n\nIn this last respect, Fell and her fellow Quakers anticipate the\nideas and arguments of later seventeenth-century feminists, such as\nMary Astell and Damaris Masham. These later women build on the basic\nProtestant insight that a woman\u2019s salvation depends upon herself\nalone and her own independent capacity for reflection on her beliefs.\nThey call on women to avoid blind obedience to human religious\nauthority and they assert a woman\u2019s capacity to discern moral and\nreligious truths for herself. But their arguments are also based on an\negalitarian concept of reason\u2014or the idea that men and women have\nthe same natural capacity for rational judgment\u2014and not the idea\nthat women are spiritually equal to men by virtue of a supernatural\nlight. It is reason, according to Astell and Masham, that is the\n\u201cCandle of the Lord\u201d in all human beings. They therefore\nemphasize that in order to attain everlasting happiness through virtue,\nwomen must be properly educated in order to improve their rational\nfaculties. In later centuries, these part-secular, part-religious ideas\nabout reason and education would evolve into calls for social and\npolitical equality for women.\n\n\nMargaret Fell is not an advocate of an egalitarian concept of reason\nor a supporter of equal educational opportunities for women. Her\narguments in favour of female preaching rest on a principle of\nspiritual equality, or the idea that both men and women have the\nsupernatural light of Christ within them. But for Fell, the ability to\nhearken to that light implicitly requires that women possess a natural\ncapacity to discern the truth for themselves, to exercise strength of\nwill, and to exhibit moral virtue or excellence of character. In these\nrespects, Fell\u2019s arguments for female preaching contain an\nimplicit feminist challenge to negative perceptions about women\u2019s\nmoral and intellectual abilities in her time. On these grounds, we\nmight conclude that her writings constitute something of a bridge\nbetween the querelle des femmes of the late-medieval period\nand the later feminist arguments of figures such as Astell and\nMasham.\n",
