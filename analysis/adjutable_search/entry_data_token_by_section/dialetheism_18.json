    "main_text": "Themes for Further Research\n7. Conclusion\n\nSince Aristotle, the assumption that consistency is a requirement for\ntruth, validity, meaning, and rationality, has gone largely\nunchallenged. Modern investigations into dialetheism, in pressing the\npossibility of inconsistent theories that are nevertheless meaningful,\nvalid, rational, and true, call that assumption into question. If\nconsistency does turn out to be a necessary condition for any of these\nnotions, dialetheism prompts us to articulate why; just by pushing\nphilosophers to find arguments for what previously were undisputed\nbeliefs renders a valuable service (Scharp 2007, p. 544). And if\nconsistency turns out not to be an essential requirement for all\ntheories, then the way is open for the rational exploration of areas\nin philosophy and the sciences that have traditionally been closed\noff. \n",
