    "main_text": "Antiquity\n1. Antiquity\n\nLippman (1992: chapter 1) observes that Greek Antiquity is responsible\nfor two ideas that shaped Western musical thought until at least the\nseventeenth century. The first amounts to a metaphysical\nclaim. While details vary greatly, this is the claim that the laws and\nstructure of music correspond to those of the universe. This view is\nat times supplemented with the additional thought that celestial\nbodies themselves produce music as they follow their orbits. The\nPythagorean concept of cosmic harmony, or harmony of the spheres, is\nthe first known example of the metaphysical conception of music. The\nsecond idea is an ethical view, sometimes referred to as\nethos theory. According to this view, music has the capacity to alter\nmood and mold personality, and thus may contribute to moral education\n(see Lippman 1964: chapter 2).\n\nSome authors, especially those of Pythagorean persuasions, explicitly\nlink the ethical view to the metaphysical one: if the whole universe\nis musical, so is the human soul, hence music\u2019s power over it.\nIn other authors, such as Aristotle, the ethical and educational value\nof music is construed as depending mainly on its capacity to imitate\nor arouse emotions.\n",
