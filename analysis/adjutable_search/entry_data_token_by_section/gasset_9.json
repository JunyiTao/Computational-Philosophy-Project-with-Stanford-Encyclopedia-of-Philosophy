This expression, which\nappears in my first book and which condenses in final volume my\nphilosophic thought, does not only mean the doctrine that my work\nexpounds and proposes, but means that my work is an executive case of\nthe same doctrine. My work is, by its essence and its presence,\ncircumstantial. This is precisely what the cited phrase declares.\n(Obras, VI: 347\u201348)\n\n\nThe first book to which Ortega referred was his Meditations on\nQuixote (1914), a work of essays he thought propelled\nphilosophical aspirations. According to some commentators, the nucleus\nof Ortega\u2019s basic philosophical principle\u2014the notion that human\nlife is the ultimate reality\u2014is formulated in the\nMeditations on Quixote through the instrumentality of his\nwell known expression, \u201cI am I and my circumstances\u201d. A\nclose and critical reading of the Meditations on Quixote and\nOrtega\u2019s later writings reveals that albeit \u201cI am I and my\ncircumstances\u201d appeared in this early work, we fail to perceive\na systematic elaboration of \u201cI am I and my circumstances\u201d\nas an analytical and ontological statement in his general philosophic\npoint of view before his later works. The psychological interpretation\nof external and internal excitation, as discussed by Freud in the\nOutline of Psychoanalysis (1904) and The Psychopathology\nof Everyday Life (1904), arrested Ortega\u2019s attention on this new\nscientific method between 1911 and 1915. Husserl and the\nphenomenological movement, and Freud and the psychoanalytical\nmovement, presented for Ortega the new \u201cintellectual tendency of\nour times\u2014subjectivism, or subjectivistic relativism\u201d\n(Obras, XII: 417). This intellectual tendency became his\nphilosophic concern during the succeeding years. This concern became\napparent in his lectures of 1921\u201322, subsequently published as\nThe Theme of Our Time (1923). For Ortega, the\n\u201cprincipal theme of our time\u201d, the essence of which\n\u201cmodernity\u201d had to confront, comprised the concept that\n\u201chuman life is in an eminent degree psychological life\u201d\n(Obras, III: 152\u2013156).\n\nThe phenomenon of human life thus possesses a \u201cdouble\ncharacter\u201d: the physiological and the psychological. In the\nmodern movement of culture, each dimension of human character has to\nfind its expression within the \u201cspirit of the time\u201d\n(Obras, III: 165\u201366, 68, 297\u201398). The\ntransformation of the modern sense of human life may be understood\nbest from the new art of his time. Ortega perceived the artists of his\nday as creating a much more radical alteration in the subjective\nattitude of art. From the point of view of the new sense of art, human\nreality possesses its inner perception. This shift of emphasis in the\nrealm of aesthetics countervailed the earlier emphasis on\n\u201cnaturalist\u201d, \u201cmaterialist\u201d or\n\u201crealist\u201d factors in human life. The transition in\naesthetic sensibility from nineteenth-century \u201crealism\u201d,\nand its corresponding concern with human reality, to the\n\u201cnew\u201d perceptions of the early twentieth century\ncreativity, marked for him the \u201cdehumanization of art\u201d.\nThe \u201cmodern\u201d movement culminated in a new aesthetic\nsensitivity\u2014what Ortega labeled a \u201cpure\u201d,\n\u201cartistic art\u201d\u2014which consciously separated its\naudience into groups: the \u201cspecially gifted minority\u201d who\ncomprehended modern art and the majority of those who found it\nincomprehensible. The new aesthetic sensibility of modernity, which\ncalled for the \u201cprogressive elimination of the human, all too\nhuman elements\u201d predominant in romantic and naturalistic\nproduction, resulted in creating an art of figures instead of an art\nof adventures, an art that refused solely to report the world, and\nvowed to create it (Obras, III: 358, 355\u201356). This\nmodern group of artists and critics who produced art and possessed\n\u201can organ of comprehension\u201d denied to the majority\nconstituted \u201ca specially gifted minority\u201d. A pronounced\nemphasis on the \u201cpsychic structure of the individual\u201d thus\nbecame one of the primary consequences of modernity\u2019s shift from\nrealism and human representation.\n\nIf Ortega\u2019s notion that the \u201cpsychic\u201d depictions of modern\nart were only accessible to a gifted minority were extended to\nincorporate the notion that every individual intellectual activity\napprehends reality from a point of view accessible only to itself, his\nphilosophy of \u201cperspectivism\u201d as the synthetic principle\nwhich \u201cregulated the world from the point of view of life\u201d\nbecomes intelligible. The \u201ctheme of our time\u201d reflected\nthe absolutist tendencies of rationalism and the skeptical\ninclinations of relativism, proposing Ortega\u2019s doctrine of \u201cthe\npoint of view as a third view of the process of knowledge, which is a\nperfect synthesis of the two\u201d (Obras, III: 179,\n198).\n",
