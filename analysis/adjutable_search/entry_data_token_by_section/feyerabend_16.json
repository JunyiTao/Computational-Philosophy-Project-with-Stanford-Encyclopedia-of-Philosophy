    "main_text": "Feyerabend\u2019s Later Work: Towards Relativism, but then Beyond It || Ten Wonderful Years: The Eighties in Berkeley and Zurich\n5.3 Ten Wonderful Years: The Eighties in Berkeley and Zurich\n\nOut of all Feyerabend\u2019s many academic positions, perhaps the one\nhe enjoyed most was his tenure throughout the 1980s at the\nEidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, Zurich. Feyerabend\napplied for the post after his friend Eric Jantsch had told him that\nthe Polytechnic was looking for a philosopher of science. The\nselection process was, by Feyerabend\u2019s account, very long and\nsomewhat involved (pp. 154ff.). Having recently left another post in\nKassel, he apparently gave up hopes of being hired by the Swiss, and\n\u201cdecided to remain in Berkeley and stop moving about\u201d (p.\n158). But, after several stages in the decision-making procedure, he\nwas finally given the job, and \u201cten wonderful years of\nhalf-Berkeley, half-Switzerland\u201d (p. 158) turned out to be\nexactly what he had been looking for. At Zurich he lectured on\nPlato\u2019s Theaetetus and Timaeus, and then on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics. The two-hour seminars, many of\nwhich were organised by Christian Thomas (with whom Feyerabend was to\nedit anthologies) were run on the same lines as Berkeley: no set\ntopic, but presentations by the participants (p. 160). Feyerabend\nlater considered this to be the period in which he \u201cgot his\nintellectual act together\u201d (p. 162), meaning that he recovered\nfrom the critical reactions to Against Method and was finally\nfreed from the necessity of defending it against all criticism.\nHowever, this didn\u2019t seem to have affected his attitude towards\nwork: in Zurich he refused offers of an office, because no office\nmeant no office hours, and therefore no waste of time (pp. 131, 158)!\n\n\nMany of the more important papers Feyerabend published during the\nmid-1980s were collected together in Farewell to Reason\n(London: Verso, 1987). The major message of this book is that\nrelativism is the solution to the problems of conflicting beliefs and\nof conflicting ways of life. Feyerabend starts by suggesting that the\ncontemporary intellectual scene in Western culture is by no means as\nfragmented and cacophonous as many intellectuals would have us\nbelieve. The surface diversity belies a deeper uniformity, a monotony\ngenerated and sustained by the cultural and ideological imperialism\nwhich the West uses to beat its opponents into submission. Such\nuniformity, however, can be shown to be harmful even when judged by\nthe standards of those who impose it. Cultural diversity, which\nalready exists in some societies, is a good thing not least because it\naffords the best defence against totalitarian domination.\n\nFeyerabend proposes to support the idea of cultural diversity both\npositively, by producing considerations in its favour, and negatively\n\u201cby criticising philosophies that oppose it\u201d\n(FTR, p. 5). Contemporary philosophies of the latter type are\nsaid to rest on the notions of Objectivity and\nReason. He seeks to undermine the former notion by pointing\nout that confrontations between cultures with strongly held opinions\nwhich are each believed by members of the cultures in question to be\nobjectively true can turn out in different ways. The result of such\nconfrontation may be the persistence of the old views, fruitful and\nmutual interaction, relativism, or argumentative evaluation.\n\u201cRelativism\u201d here means the decision to treat the other\npeople\u2019s form of life and the beliefs it embodies as\n\u201ctrue-for-them\u201d, while treating our own views as\n\u201ctrue-for-us\u201d. Feyerabend feels that this is an\nappropriate way to resolve such confrontation.\n\nAdmittedly, these outcomes are indeed possible. But this does not\nestablish any form of relativism. Indeed, we might as well turn the\nargument around, and say that the possibility of the dispute being\nresolved by one participant freely coming around to the other\u2019s\npoint of view shows the untenability of relativism.\n\nFeyerabend complains that the ideas of reason and rationality are\n\u201cambiguous and never clearly explained\u201d (FTR, p.\n10); they are deified hangovers from autocratic times which no longer\nhave any content but whose \u201chalo of excellence\u201d (ibid.)\nclings to them and lends them spurious respectability:\n\n[R]ationalism has no identifiable content and reason no recognisable\nagenda over and above the principles of the party that happens to have\nappropriated its name. All it does now is to lend class to the general\ndrive towards monotony. It is time to disengage Reason from this drive\nand, as it has been thoroughly compromised by the association, to bid\nit farewell. (FTR, p. 13).\n\n\nRelativism is the tool with which Feyerabend hopes to \u201cundermine\nthe very basis of Reason\u201d (ibid.). But is it Reason with a\ncapital \u201cR\u201d, the philosophers\u2019 abstraction alone,\nthat is to be renounced, or reason itself too? Feyerabend is on weak\nground when he claims that \u201cReason\u201d is a\nphilosophers\u2019 notion which has no content, for it is precisely\nthe philosopher who is willing to attach a specific content\nto the formal notion of rationality (unlike the layperson, whose\nnotion of reason is closer to what Feyerabend calls the\n\u201cmaterial\u201d conception, where to be rational is \u201cto\navoid certain views and to accept others\u201d (ibid., p. 10)). \n\nRelativism is a result of cultural confrontation, an \u201cattempt to\nmake sense of the phenomenon of cultural variety\u201d (FTR,\np. 19). Feyerabend is well aware that the term\n\u201crelativism\u201d itself is understood in many different ways.\nBut his attempt to occupy a substantial yet defensible relativist\nposition is a failure. At some points he merely endorses views which\nno-one would deny, but which do not deserve to be called relativist\n(such as the idea that people may profit from studying other points of\nview, no matter how strongly they hold their own view (FTR,\np. 20)). At others he does manage to subscribe to a genuinely\nrelativist view, but fails to show why it must be accepted.\n\nIt was only in 1988, on the 50th anniversary of Austria\u2019s\nunification with Germany, that Feyerabend became interested in his\npast (p. 1). The Feyerabends left California for life in Switzerland\nand Italy in the fall of 1989 (p. 2). It was during this move that\nFeyerabend re-discovered his mother\u2019s suicide note (p. 9), which\nmay have been one of the factors that spurred him to write his\nautobiography. Feyerabend looked forward to his retirement, and he and\nGrazia decided to try to have children. He claimed to have forgotten\nthe thirty-five years of his academic career almost as quickly as he\nhad earlier forgotten his military service (p. 168).\n",
