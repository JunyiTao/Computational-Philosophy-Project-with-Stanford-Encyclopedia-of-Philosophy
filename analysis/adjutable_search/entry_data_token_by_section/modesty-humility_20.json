    "main_text": "Epistemology || Open-Mindedness\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nModesty and humility touch on a variety of more general issues in\nphilosophy. It relates to moral issues about self and other: Whether\nthere are special moral requirements regarding our self-orientation and\nif so, what underlies them?\n\n\nIt also touches on a variety of debates within virtue theory: What\nkinds of self-attitudes enable the exercise of virtue? What features of\nthe self are salient to a virtuous person? What features make the\nstates associated with modesty and humility virtuous in the first\nplace?\n\n\nFinally, it involves questions that arise at the intersection of\nethics and epistemology: Are there moral or rational limits on the\nkinds of goodness or badness I can attribute to myself? Can moral\nvirtue be compatible with, or even require, epistemic failings? Careful\ntheorizing about the nature of modesty and humility helps to shape and\ninform these larger questions in ethics and epistemology.\n",
