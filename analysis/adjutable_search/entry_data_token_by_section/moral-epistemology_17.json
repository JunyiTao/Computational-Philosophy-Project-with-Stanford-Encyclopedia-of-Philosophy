    "main_text": "The Six Clusters of Problems: Any Progress?\n11. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has addressed six major clusters of problems that threaten\nthe possibility of moral knowledge. Subject to the constraints noted\nat the outset, the aim has been to examine these problems with an eye\nto their complexity, especially their mutual ramifications, and to\nexplore avenues of possible resolution that are evident in the\nphilosophical and interdisciplinary literature. From this survey, we\ncan see that for each cluster of problems there are avenues of\nresolution worth further exploration, especially given\ninterdisciplinary research implying that moral knowledge is deeply\nsocial.\n",
