    "main_text": "Synchronic Norms (II): The Problem of the Priors || Forward-Looking Bayesianism\n4.3 Forward-Looking Bayesianism\n\nSome Bayesians propose that some norms for priors can be obtained by\nlooking into possible futures, with two steps (Good 1976):\n\n\nStep I (Think Ahead). Develop a normative\nconstraint C on the posteriors in some possible futures in\nwhich new evidence is acquired.\nStep II (Solve Backwards). Require one\u2019s\npriors to be such that, after conditionalization on new evidence, its\nposterior must satisfy C.\n\n\n\nFor lack of a standard name, this approach may be called\nforward-looking Bayesianism. This name is used here as an\numbrella term to cover different possible implementations, of which\ntwo are presented below.\n\nHere is one implementation. It might be held that one ought to favor a\nhypothesis if it explains the available evidence better than any other\ncompeting hypotheses do. This view is called inference to the best\nexplanation (IBE) if construed as a method for theory choice, as\noriginally developed in the epistemology of all-or-nothing beliefs\n(Harman 1986). It can be carried over to Bayesian epistemology as\nfollows:\n\n\nExplanationist Bayesianism (Preliminary\nVersion). One\u2019s prior ought to be such that, given each\nbody of evidence under consideration, a hypothesis that explains the\nevidence better has a higher posterior.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s stated here is only a preliminary version. More\nsophisticated versions are developed by Lipton (2004: ch. 7) and\nWeisberg (2009a). This view is resisted by some Bayesians to varying\ndegrees. van Fraassen (1989: ch. 7) argues that IBE should be rejected\nbecause it is in tension with the two core Bayesian norms. Okasha\n(2000) argues that IBE only serves as a good heuristic for guiding\none\u2019s credence change. Henderson (2014) argues that IBE need not\nbe assumed to guide one\u2019s credence change because it can be\njustified by little more than the two core Bayesian norms. For more on\nIBE, see the entry on\n abduction,\n in which sections 3.1 and 4 discuss explanationist Bayesianism.\n\nHere is another implementation of forward-looking Bayesianism. It\nmight be thought that, although a scientific method for theory choice\nis subject to error due to its inductive nature, it is supposed to be\nable, in a sense, to correct itself. This view is called the\nself-corrective thesis, originally developed in the epistemology\nof all-or-nothing beliefs by Peirce (1903) and Reichenbach (1938: sec.\n38\u201340). But it can be carried over to Bayesian epistemology as\nfollows:\n\n\nSelf-Correctionist Bayesianism (Preliminary\nVersion). One\u2019s prior ought, if possible, to have at least\nthe following self-corrective property in every possible state of the\nworld under consideration: one\u2019s posterior credence in the true\nhypothesis under consideration would eventually become high and stay\nso if the evidence were to accumulate indefinitely.\n\n\n\nAn early version of this view is developed by Freedman (1963) in\nstatistics; see Wasserman (1998: sec. 1\u20133) for a minimally\ntechnical overview. The self-corrective property concerns the long\nrun, so it invites the standard, Keynesian worry that the long run\nmight be too long. For replies, see Diaconis & Freedman (1986b:\npp. 63\u201364) and Kelly (2000: sec. 7). A related worry is that a\nlong-run norm puts no constraint on what matters, namely, our doxastic\nstates in the short run (Carnap 1945). A possible reply is that the\nself-corrective property is only a minimum qualification of\npermissible priors and can be conjoined with other norms for credences\nto generate a significant constraint on priors. To substantiate that\nreply, it has been argued that such a constraint on priors is actually\nstronger than what the rival Bayesians have to offer in some important\ncases of statistical inference (Diaconis & Freedman 1986a) and\nenumerative induction (Lin forthcoming).\n\nThe above two versions of forward-looking Bayesianism both encourage\nBayesians to do this: assimilate some ideas (such as IBE or\nself-correction) that have long been taken seriously in some\nnon-Bayesian traditions of epistemology. Forward-looking Bayesianism\nseems to be a convenient template for doing that.\n",
