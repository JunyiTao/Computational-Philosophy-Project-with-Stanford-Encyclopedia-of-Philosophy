    "main_text": "Human Reproductive Cloning || Human Dignity\n3.4 Human Dignity\n\nUNESCO\u2019s Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human\nRights (1997) was the first international instrument to condemn human\nreproductive cloning as a practice against human dignity. Article 11\nof this Declaration states: \u201cPractices which are contrary to\nhuman dignity, such as reproductive cloning of human beings, shall not\nbe permitted\u2026\u201d This position is shared by the World\nHealth Organization, the European Parliament and several other\ninternational instruments. Critics have pointed out that the reference\nto human dignity is problematic as it is rarely specified how human\ndignity is to be understood, whose dignity is at stake, and how\ndignity is relevant to the ethics of cloning (Harris 2004, Ch.2,\nBirnbacher 2005, McDougall 2008,). Some commentators state that it is\nthe copying of a genome which violates human dignity (Kass 1998);\nothers have pointed out that this interpretation could be experienced\nas an offence to genetically identical twins, and that we typically do\nnot regard twins as a threat to human dignity (although some societies\nin the past did), nor do we prevent twins from coming into existence.\nOn the contrary, IVF, which involves an increased \u2018risk\u2019\nof having twins, is a widely accepted fertility treatment.\n\nHuman dignity is most often related to Kant\u2019s second formulation\nof the Categorical Imperative, namely the idea that we should never\nuse a person merely as a means to an end. I have, however, already\ndiscussed this concern in section 4.2.2.\n",
