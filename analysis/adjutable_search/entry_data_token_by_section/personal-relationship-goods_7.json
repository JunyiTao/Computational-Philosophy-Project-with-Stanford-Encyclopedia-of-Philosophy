    "main_text": "The Value of Personal Relationship Goods || Survival, Health and Development\n3.2 Survival, Health and Development\n\nFirst and foremost, personal relationship goods are necessary for\nminimally functional lives (Kittay 1999; Liao 2006; Gheaus 2009;\nBrownlee 2013, 2016a). As already noted, a foundational claim of the\nethics of care is that all individuals go through periods of\nvulnerability\u2014most notably childhood\u2014during which they\ncannot survive, let alone flourish, without the care of another human\nbeing. Relying on empirical research, Brownlee (2013) extends a\nsimilar claim to people of all ages. She argues that chronic lack of\nadequate social contact\n\n\ngenerates the same threat response as pain, thirst, hunger, or fear by\nsetting off a chain of anxiety-inducing physiological reactions known\nas the \u2018fight or flight\u2019 response. (p. 211)\n\n\nand leads to a host of physical and mental health problems such as\nhigh blood pressure, obesity, diminished immunity, alcoholism,\nsuicidal tendencies and depression. Adequate social contact, in this\ncontext, includes ongoing relationships that are not (significantly)\nabusive or neglectful and that provide psychological support and\nacceptance. Not only children\u2019s health, and that of individuals\nwho are ill or disabled, but everybody\u2019s, depends on being in\nsome personal relationship(s). Further, she claims, individuals\u2019\nemotional, linguistic, and social abilities also depend on enough\nsocial contact.\n\nBrownlee argues that, because \u201cwhen we are deprived of adequate\nsocial connections \u2026 we tend to break down mentally,\nemotionally, and physically\u201d (2016a: 55), we have rights to the\nprovision of those personal relationship goods that make minimally\nadequate lives possible. A group of personal relationship goods that\nhas obvious instrumental value are those realized in very close caring\nrelationships. It is difficult to dispute that some such goods,\nincluding affection, companionship, emotional care, attention,\nencouragement and so on contribute to other aspects of\nindividuals\u2019 wellbeing. More controversially, Matthew Liao\nargues\u2014relying on empirical sources\u2014that lack of love\nthreatens the physical, psychological and social development of\nchildren and therefore entitles them to love (Liao 2006, 2015; Cowden\n2012a). (The alleged duty to love children is more fully discussed in\n section 4).\n",
