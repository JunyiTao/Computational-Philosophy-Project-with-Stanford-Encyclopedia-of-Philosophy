    "main_text": "The Nature of Philosophy\n2. The Nature of Philosophy\n\nThe traditional ambition of philosophy, in epistemology and\nmetaphysics, is to provide a systematic account of the extent and\nreliability of our knowledge, and on that basis, to provide a synoptic\nand well-based account of the main features of Reality. When Williams\nwas in his prime, this ambition was largely repudiated as\ninappropriate or unattainable, and a much more modest role for\nphilosophy was proposed. In setting forth his own position, in the\npreface to the collection of his selected essays (1966, p.viii), he\nlists some of these fashionable philosophies from the mid-twentieth\ncentury:\n\n\n\u2026logical positivism, logical behaviorism, operationalism,\ninstrumentalism, the miscellaneous American linguisticisms, the\nEnglish varieties of Wittgensteinism, the Existentialisms, and Zen\nBuddhism\u2026\n\n\nEach of these is, in its own way, a gospel of relaxation. They all\npropose that, in place of the struggle to uncover how things are,\ncareful descriptions of how things appear will suffice. None is\nambitious enough to set about constructing a positive and systematic\nepistemology and metaphysics.\n\nUndeterred by this spirit of the age, Williams continued to insist\nthat philosophical issues, including those of traditional metaphysics,\nare real questions with genuine answers (Fisher 2017). Conceptual\nanalysis, concentration on phenomenological description, or\nexploration of the vagaries of language, may have their (subordinate)\nplace, but to elevate them to a central position is an evasion of\nphilosophy\u2019s main task.\n\nStill worse was the suggestion that philosophical questions are mere\nsurface expressions of a philosopher\u2019s underlying\npsycho-pathology. The claim of Morris Lazerowitz to that effect,\nsuggesting that Bradley\u2019s Absolute Idealism was no more than an\nintellectual\u2019s poorly expressed death wish, or that\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument against the reality of time a panic fear of\nchange, he met with a stern rebuke (1959, pp 133\u201356).\n\nHe set forth a Realist philosophy on traditional empiricist\nprinciples: \u201cHe thought that practically everything was right\nout there where it belonged\u201d (Firth, Nozick and Quine 1983, p\n246). He maintained that while all knowledge of fact rests on\nperceptual experience, it is not limited to the perceptually given,\nbut can be extended beyond that by legitimate inference (1934a). In\nthis way his Realism can develop the breadth and depth required to do\njustice to all the scientific techniques which so far surpass mere\nperception.\n\nWilliams\u2019s empiricism extended to philosophy itself. He\nchallenged the prevailing orthodoxy that philosophy is a purely a\npriori discipline. He emphasized the provisional character of\nmuch philosophizing, and the striking absence of knock-down arguments\nin philosophic controversy (\u201cHaving Ideas In The Head\u201d\n1966, 189\u2013211).\n",
