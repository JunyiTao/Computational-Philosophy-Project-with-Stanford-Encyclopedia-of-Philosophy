    "main_text": "Can The Cognitivist/Non-cognitivist Distinction Be Sustained? || Non-cognitivist Overreaching and Possible Collapse\n6. Conclusion\n\nNon-cognitivism first came on the scene as a rather starkly drawn\nalternative to prevailing cognitivist and realist construals of moral\ndiscourse. As it developed to enable it to explain features of moral\ndiscourse relied on by its critics, the view became more subtle and\npresented a less stark contrast with realist positions. The main\nnegative claims were often somewhat moderated. For example, the claim\nthat moral judgments had no descriptive meaning evolved into a claim\nthat any such meanings were secondary. The claim that moral judgments\ncould not be true or false became the claim that they could be true or\nfalse only in a minimal or deflationary sense. Not all of the shifts\nhave been embraced by all non-cognitivists, but it is fair to say that\ncurrent versions are more complex and subtle than the theories from\nwhich they descend. As a result the arguments for and against the\nviews have gotten rather intricate and even technical. That trend is\nlikely to continue for at least a while longer as ideas from other\nareas of philosophy are employed to further hone the objections and\nfill out the responses to them.\n",
