    "main_text": "Developmental and Social Psychology || Impulse\n1.1 Impulse\n\nHumans begin life endowed only with impulses as motor sources of\nactivity. Impulses include drives, appetites, instincts, and reflexes.\nThey are \u201caffective-motor responses\u201d: primitive tendencies\nof movement toward some things (eyes toward human faces, hand to\ngrasping whatever is within reach), away from others (spitting out\nbitter food, averting eyes from too bright light, brushing off pesky\nflies), and even activity with no particular orientation toward\nexternal objects (stretching, rolling over, crying, fidgeting).\nImpulsive activity is not purposive. It involves no idea of an end to\nbe achieved by the activity. When a newborn sucks on its\nmother\u2019s nipple, it obtains food and thereby satisfies its\nhunger. But it has no idea that this will be a consequence of its\nsucking, and does not suck with the end in view of obtaining food (HNC\n65\u201369).\n\nDewey\u2019s choice of impulse as the original motor source of\nconduct contrasts with conventional desire-based psychology in two\nways. First, it takes activity rather than rest as the default state\nof human beings. Desires are defined by the states of affairs they aim\nto achieve. On this model, action needs to be inspired by an idea of\nsome deficit. Once the deficit is repaired, the desire is fulfilled,\nand the organism returns to a state of rest. Dewey observed that this\nmodel does not fit what we know about children. They are constantly in\nmotion even when they achieve no particular purpose in moving. They\ndon\u2019t need any end in view or perception of external lack to\nmove them (HNC 118\u20139). Second, impulse psychology stresses the\nplasticity of the sources of conduct. Desires are fixed by their ends.\nImpulses can be directed and shaped toward various ends.\nChildren\u2019s primitive impulses to move their bodies energetically\ncan be directed, through education, toward the development of socially\nvalued skills and interpersonally coordinated activity (HNC\n69\u201375).\n\nDesires or ends in view arise from the child\u2019s experiences of\nthe consequences of its impulsive activity. A newborn infant cries\nwhen it is hungry, at first with no end in view. It observes that\ncrying results in a feeding, which relieves its hunger. It gets the\nidea that by crying, it can get relief. When crying is prompted by\nthis idea, the child sees it as a means to a further end, and acts for\nthe first time on a desire (that is, with an end in view) (TV\n197\u20138). What desires the child acquires are shaped by\nothers\u2019 responses to its original impulsive activity, by the\nresults that others permit such activity to achieve. Parents who\nrespond indiscriminately to their children\u2019s crying end up with\nspoiled children whose desires proliferate without consideration for\nothers\u2019 interests. Parents who respond selectively shape both\ntheir children\u2019s use of means (crying) and their ends, which are\nmodulated in response to the resistance and claims of others. This\nplasticity of ends and means is possible because the original source\nof activity is impulse, not desire. Impulses demand some outlet, but\nwhat ends they seek depends on the environment, especially\nothers\u2019 responses to the child.\n",
