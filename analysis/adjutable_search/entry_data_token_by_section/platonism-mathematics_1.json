    "main_text": "What is Mathematical Platonism? || Historical remarks\n1.1 Historical remarks\n\nPlatonism must be distinguished from the view of the historical Plato.\nFew parties to the contemporary debate about platonism make strong\nexegetical claims about Plato\u2019s view, much less defend it.\nAlthough the view that we are calling \u2018platonism\u2019 is\ninspired by Plato\u2019s famous theory of abstract and eternal Forms\n(see the entry on\n Plato\u2019s metaphysics and epistemology),\n platonism is now defined and debated independently of its original\nhistorical inspiration.\n\nNot only is the platonism under discussion not Plato\u2019s,\nplatonism as characterized above is a purely metaphysical view: it\nshould be distinguished from other views that have substantive\nepistemological content. Many older characterizations of platonism add\nstrong epistemological claims to the effect that we have some\nimmediate grasp of, or insight into, the realm of abstract objects.\n(See e.g., Rees 1967.) But it is useful (and nowadays fairly standard)\nto reserve the term \u2018platonism\u2019 for the purely\nmetaphysical view described above. Many philosophers who defend\nplatonism in this purely metaphysical sense would reject the\nadditional epistemological claims. Examples include Quine and other\nphilosophers attracted to the so-called indispensability\nargument, which seeks to give a broadly empirical defense of\nmathematical platonism. (See the entry on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nFinally, the above definition of \u2018mathematical platonism\u2019\nexcludes the claim that all truths of pure mathematics are necessary,\nalthough this claim has traditionally been made by most platonists.\nAgain, this exclusion is justified by the fact that some philosophers\nwho are generally regarded as platonists (for instance, Quine and some\nadherents of the aforementioned indispensability argument) reject this\nadditional modal claim .\n",
