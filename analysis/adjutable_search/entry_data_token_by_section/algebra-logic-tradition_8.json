Stone: Models for the Algebra of Logic\n\nTraditional logic studied certain simple relationships between\nclasses, namely being a subclass of and having a nonempty\nintersection with. However, once one adopted an axiomatic\napproach, the topic of possible models besides the obvious ones\nsurfaced. Beltrami introduced models of non-Euclidean geometry in the\nlate 1860s. In the 1890s Schr\u00f6der and Dedekind constructed models\nof the axioms of lattice theory to show that the distributive law did\nnot follow. But when it came to the algebra of classes, Schr\u00f6der\nconsidered only the standard models, namely each was the collection of\nall subclasses of a given class.\n\nThe study of general models of the axioms of Boolean algebra did not\nget underway until the late 1920s; it was soon brought to a very high\nlevel in the work of Marshall Harvey Stone (1903\u20131989) (see his\npapers 1936, 1937). He was interested in the structure of rings of\nlinear operators and realized that the central idempotents, that is,\nthe operators \\(E\\) that commuted with all other operators in the ring\nunder multiplication (that is, \\(EL = LE\\) for all \\(L\\) in the ring)\nand which were idempotent under multiplication (\\(EE = E\\)) played an\nimportant role. In a natural way, the central idempotents formed a\nBoolean algebra.\n\nPursuing this direction of research led Stone to ask about the\nstructure of an arbitrary Boolean algebra, a question that he answered\nby proving that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a Boolean\nalgebra of sets. In his work on Boolean algebras he noticed a\ncertain analogy between kernels of homomorphisms and the ideals\nstudied in ring theory\u2014this led him to give the name\n\u201cideal\u201d to such kernels. Not long after this he discovered\na translation between Boolean algebras and Boolean rings; under this\ntranslation the ideals of a Boolean algebra corresponded precisely to\nthe ideals of the associated Boolean ring. His next major contribution\nwas to establish a correspondence between Boolean algebras and certain\ntopological spaces now called Boolean spaces (or Stone spaces). This\ncorrespondence would later prove to be a valuable tool in the\nconstruction of exotic Boolean algebras. These results of Stone are\nstill a paradigm for developments in the algebra of logic.\n\nInspired by the rather brief treatment of first-order statements about\nrelations in Vol. III of the Algebra der Logik,\nL\u00f6wenheim (1915) showed that if such a statement could be\nsatisfied in an infinite domain then it could be satisfied in a\ndenumerable domain. In 1920 Thoralf Skolem (1887\u20131963)\nsimplified L\u00f6wenheim\u2019s proof by introducing Skolem normal forms,\nand in 1928 Skolem replaced his use of normal forms with a simpler\nidea, namely to use what are now called Skolem functions. He used\nthese functions to convert first-order sentences into universal\nsentences, that is to say, into sentences in prenex form with all\nquantifiers being universal (\\(\\forall\\)).\n",
