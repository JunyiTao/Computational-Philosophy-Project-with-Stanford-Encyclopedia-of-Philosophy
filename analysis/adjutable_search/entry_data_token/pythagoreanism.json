Aristotle\u2019s expression, \u201cso-called\nPythagoreans,\u201d suggests both that at his time this group of\nthinkers was commonly called Pythagoreans and, at the same time, calls\ninto question the actual connection between these thinkers and\nPythagoras himself. Aristotle ascribes no specific names to these\nPythagoreans, but the philosophy which he assigns to them is very\nsimilar to what is found in the fragments of\n Philolaus\n of Croton (ca. 470-ca. 390 BCE). Thus, Philolaus and his successor\nEurytus are likely to have been the most prominent of these\nPythagoreans. Philolaus posits limiters and unlimiteds as first\nprinciples and emphasizes the role of number in understanding the\ncosmos. Aristotle also identifies a distinct group of these so-called\nPythagoreans who formulated a set of basic principles known as the\ntable of opposites. Plato\u2019s sole reference to Pythagoreans cites\ntheir search for the numerical structure of contemporary music and is\nprobably an allusion to\n Archytas\n (ca. 420-ca. 350 BCE), who is the first great mathematician in the\nPythagorean tradition. Starting from the system of Philolaus he\ndeveloped his own sophisticated account of the world in terms of\nmathematical proportion.\n\n(3) Many other sixth-, fifth- and fourth-century thinkers are labeled\nPythagoreans in the Greek tradition after the fourth century BCE. By\nthe late fourth century CE many of the most prominent Greek\nphilosophers including Parmenides, Plato and Aristotle come to be\ncalled Pythagoreans, with no historical justification. There are\nnonetheless a number of thinkers of the fifth and fourth century BCE,\nwho can legitimately be called Pythagoreans, although often little is\nknown about them except their names. The most important of these\nfigures is Hippasus. What criterion should be used to identify an\nearly figure as a Pythagorean is controversial and there is debate\nabout individual cases. Fourth-century evidence shows that\nPythagoreanism gave an unusually large role to women for an ancient\nphilosophhical school. It is likely that the Pythagorean communities\nthat practiced a way of life that they traced back to Pythagoras died\nout in the middle of the fourth century BCE. \n\n(4) The last manifestation of Pythagoreanism, Neopythagoreanism, has\nbeen the most influential. Neopythagoreanism is not a unified school\nof thought but rather a tendency, stretching over many centuries, to\nview Pythagoras, with no historical justification, as the central and\noriginal figure in the whole Greek philosophical tradition. This\nPythagoras is often thought to have received his philosophy as a\ndivine revelation, which had been given even earlier to wise men of\nthe ancient Near East such as the Persian Magi, the Hebrews (Moses in\nparticular), and the Egyptian priests. All Greek philosophy after\nPythagoras, insofar as it may be true, is seen as derived from this\nrevelation. Thus, Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s ideas are viewed\nas derived from Pythagoras (with the mediation of other early\nPythagoreans). Many pseudepigrapha are produced in later times in\norder to provide the Pythagorean \u201coriginals\u201d on which\nPlato and Aristotle drew. Some strands of the Neopythagorean tradition\nemphasize Pythagoras as master metaphysician, who supposedly\noriginated what are, in fact, the principles of Plato\u2019s later\nmetaphysics, the one and the indefinite dyad. Other Neopythagoreans\ncelebrate Pythagoras as the founder of the quadrivium of\nmathematical sciences (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music),\nwhile still others portray him as a magician or as a religious expert\nand sage, upon whom we should model our lives. Neopythagoreanism\nprobably began already in the second half of the fourth century BCE\namong Plato\u2019s first successors in the Academy, but particularly\nflourished from the first century BCE until the end of antiquity.\nNeopythagoreanism has close connections to Middle and Neoplatonism and\nfrom the time of Iamblichus (4th c. CE) is largely absorbed into\nNeoplatonism. It was the Neopythagorean version of Pythagoreanism that\ndominated in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.\n", "toc": [{"#PhilPyth": "1.

The Philosophy of Pythagoras\n\nSee the entry on\n Pythagoras.\n2. The Most Prominent Pythagoreans of the Fifth and Fourth Century\n2.1 Philolaus\n\nSee the entry on\n Philolaus.\n2.2 Eurytus\n\nIn the ancient sources, Eurytus is most frequently mentioned in the\nsame breath as Philolaus, and he is probably the student of Philolaus\n(Iamblichus, VP 148, 139). Aristoxenus (4th c. BCE) presents\nPhilolaus and Eurytus as the teachers of the last generation of\nPythagoreans (Diogenes Laertius VIII 46) and Diogenes Laertius reports\nthat Plato came to Italy to meet Philolaus and Eurytus after the death\nof Socrates (III 46). In order to be the pupil of Philolaus, who was\nborn around 470, and teach the last generation of Pythagoreans around\n400, Eurytus would need to be born between 450 and 440. The sources\nare very confused as to which S. Italian city he was from, Croton\n(Iamblichus, VP 148), Tarentum (Iamblichus, VP 267;\nDiogenes Laertius VIII 46) or Metapontum (Iamblichus, VP 266\nand 267). It may be that the Eurytus from Metapontum is a different\nEurytus. It is possible that Archytas studied with Eurytus, since\nTheophrastus (Aristotle\u2019s successor in the Lyceum) cites\nArchytas as the source for the one testimony we have about the\nphilosophy of Eurytus (Metaph. 6a 19\u201322). In the\ncatalogue of Pythagoreans at the end of Iamblichus\u2019 On the\nPythagorean Life (267), Eurytus appears between Philolaus and\nArchytas in the list of Pythagoreans from Tarentum, which may thus\nsuggest that he was regarded as the pupil of Philolaus and a teacher\nof Archytas.\n\nAccording to Theophrastus (Metaph. 6a 19\u201322), Eurytus\narranged pebbles in a certain way in order to show the number which\ndefined things in the world, such as a man or a horse. Aristotle\nrefers to the same practice (Metaph. 1092b8 ff.), and\nAlexander provides commentary on the Aristotelian passage\n(CAG I. 827.9). Aristotle introduces Eurytus as someone who\nregarded numbers as causes of substances by being the points that\nbound spatial magnitudes. He says that Eurytus made likenesses of the\nshapes of things in the natural world with pebbles and thus determined\nthe number which belongs to each thing by the number of pebbles\nrequired. Scholars often treat Eurytus\u2019 procedure as puerile and\nhave sometimes not taken him seriously (Kahn 2001, 33), or suggested\nthat Theophrastus is ironical in his presentation (e.g., Zhmud 2012,\n410\u2013411). There is, however, no obvious irony in\nTheophrastus\u2019 remarks. He, in fact, presents Eurytus very\npositively as someone who showed in detail how specific parts of the\ncosmos arose out of basic principles, in contrast to other thinkers,\nwho posit basic principles but do not go very far in explaining how\nthe world arises from those principles. This positive presentation may\nreflect Theophrastus\u2019 source, Archytas, who perhaps saw Eurytus\nas attempting to carry out Philolaus\u2019 project of determining the\nnumbers that give us knowledge of things in the world (Huffman 2005,\n55; see also Netz 2014, 173\u2013178).\n\nHow are we, then, to understand Eurytus\u2019 procedure? It does not\nseem plausible to suppose that he simply drew a picture or an outline\ndrawing of a man or a horse and then counted the number of pebbles\nrequired to make the outline (Riedweg 2005, 86) or fill in the\npicture, since the number would vary with the size of the drawing and\nthe size of the pebbles. A large picture of a man would require many\nmore pebbles than a small one, so that it would seem arbitrary which\nnumber to associate with man. This interpretation treats Eurytus as a\nmosaicist and is largely derived from Alexander\u2019s testimony.\nAristotle\u2019s presentation supports another interpretation. He\ndraws a parallel with those who arrange numbers of pebbles into\nshapes, such as a triangle or a square. This suggests that Eurytus had\nobserved that, e.g., any three points in a plane determine a triangle\nand any four a quadrilateral. He may then have drawn the general\nconclusion that any shape or structure was determined by a unique\nnumber of points and tried to represent these by setting out the\nnecessary number of pebbles. Thus, the complex structure of a\nthree-dimensional object such as the human body would require a large\nnumber of points, but the number of points required to determine a\nhuman being could be expected to be unique and to differ from the\nnumber that determined any other object in the natural world, such as\na horse (Kirk and Raven 1957, 313 ff.; Guthrie 1962, 273 ff.; Barnes\n1982, 390\u2013391; Cambiano 1998). It is important to note that\nnothing in these reports suggests that Eurytus thought that things\nwere composed of numbers or that he regarded the points that defined a\ngiven thing as atoms of which things were made, as has sometimes been\nsupposed (Cornford 1922\u20131923, 10\u201311). Instead, he is best\nunderstood as making a bold attempt to show that the structure of all\nthings is determined by number and thus to provide specifics for\nPhilolaus\u2019 general thesis that all things are known through\nnumber. Another approach is to argue that no reference is being made\nto creating a picture out of pebbles. The pebbles refer instead to\ncounters on an abacus, which the Greeks used for calculations. In this\ncase Eurytus can be supposed to have started by identifying certain\nbasic numerical properties with features of the world and then\nderiving the number of man or horse through calculations using the\nabacus (Netz 2014, 173\u2013178).\n2.3 Aristotle\u2019s \u201cSo-called\u201d Pythagoreans\n\nAristotle refers to the Pythagoreans frequently in his extant works,\nespecially in the Metaphysics. There are several puzzles\nabout these references. First, his usual practice is to refer to the\nPythagoreans as a group rather than naming individuals. He mentions\nPhilolaus and Eurytus by name only once each and Archytas four times.\nYet, the basic Pythagorean system which he describes in most detail in\nMetaphysics 1.5 shows such strong similarities to the\nfragments of Philolaus that Philolaus must be the primary source\n(Huffman 1993, 28\u201394, Schofield 2012, 147), although some\nscholars emphasize that Aristotle clearly did use other sources\n(Primavesi 2012, 255) and even that Philolaus, while perhaps the acme\nof Pythagorean philosophy, might not have represented mainstream\nPythagoreanism thus explaining why Aristotle refers to the\nPythagoreans as a group rather than singling out Philolaus (McKirahan\n2013). Second, he frequently refers to the Pythagoreans that he\ndiscusses as the \u201cso-called\u201d Pythagoreans. Why does he add\nthe qualifying phrase \u201cso-called?\u201d This phrase indicates\nnot that these are false Pythagoreans in contrast to some other true\nPythagoreans but rather that this is the standard way of referring to\nthese people, it is what people call them; but the phrase also\nindicates that Aristotle has reservations about the name. Aristotle is\nexpressing his doubts about how or whether these figures are connected\nto Pythagoras himself, whom Aristotle regards as a wonder-working\nfounder of a way of life rather than as participating in the tradition\nof Presocratic cosmology (Huffman 1993, 31\u201334). It could also be\nthat it is the very variety of sources that Aristotle is using that\nleads him to recognize that there are quite different stages in the\ndevelpment of Pythagoreanism and hence to wonder in what sense a\nfigure like Philolaus who is at the end of that development should\nstill be called a Pythagorean (Primavesi 2014).\n\nThe biggest puzzle, however, concerns the philosophical system that\nAristotle assigns to the Pythagoreans. For the purposes of his\ndiscussion in the Metaphysics, he treats most Pythagoreans as\nadopting a mainstream system in contrast to another group of\nPythagoreans whose system is based on the table of opposites (see\nsection 2.4). The central thesis of the mainstream system is stated in\ntwo basic ways: the Pythagoreans say that things are numbers or that\nthey are made out of numbers. In his most extended account of the\nsystem in Metphysics 1.5, Aristotle says that the\nPythagoreans were led to this view by noticing more similarities\nbetween things and numbers than between things and the elements, such\nas fire and water, adopted by earlier thinkers. The Pythagoreans thus\nconcluded that things were or were made of numbers and that the\nprinciples of numbers, the odd and the even, are principles of all\nthings. The odd is limited and the even unlimited. Aristotle\ncriticizes the Pythagoreans for being so enamored of numerical order\nthat they imposed it on the world even where it was not suggested by\nthe phenomena. Thus appearances suggested that there were nine\nheavenly bodies orbiting in the heavens but, since they regarded ten\nas the perfect number, they supposed that there must be a tenth\nheavenly body, the counter-earth, which we cannot see. Later,\nAristotle is also critical of the Pythagoreans for employing\nprinciples that do not derive from the sensible world, i.e.,\nmathematical principles, even though all their efforts were directed\nat explaining the physical world (Metaphysics 989b29). How\ncan they explain features of physical bodies such as weight or motion\nusing principles which have no weight and do not move\n(990a8\u2013990a16)? Indeed, it becomes clear that Aristotle\ninterpreted the Pythagorean cosmogony as starting out by constructing\nthe number one. The one then draws in the unlimited and produces the\nrest of the number series and evidently the cosmos at the same time.\nThe number one and the other numbers from 1 to 10 are conceived of as\nphysical entities (Metaphysics 1091a13\u201318). The puzzle\nis that Aristotle\u2019s description makes clear that he is basically\ndescribing Philolaus\u2019 system (e.g., the counter-earth, limit and\nunlimited, the generation of a one), yet a number of his central\nassertions are flatly contradicted by the surviving fragments of\nPhilolaus. Most importantly, Philolaus never says that things are\nnumbers or are made out of numbers. For Philolaus things are composed\nof limiters and unlimiteds held together by harmony (Frs. 1, 2 and 6)\nand unlimiteds appear to include physical things like fire and breath\n(Fr. 7, Aristotle Fr. 201). Numbers and the odd and the even do play a\nprominent role in Philolaus (Frs. 4\u20135), but there is no hint\nthat they are understood as physical entites. Instead number has an\nepistemological role: all things are known through number (Fr. 4). How\nare we to explain this tension between what Aristotle reports and the\nfragments of Philolaus? One approach is to recognize that Aristotle is\nnot giving a historical report of what the Pythagoreans said but an\ninterpretation of what he found in Philolaus and others. He does not\nin fact know of any text in which the Pythagoreans said that things\nwere numbers or were made of numbers. Instead this is a conclusion\ndrawn by Aristotle; it is his summary statement of what the\nPythagorean system amounts to. That this is what Aristotle is doing is\nsuggested by another passage in the Metaphysics where he\nstarts out by flatly stating that the Pythagoreans say that all things\nare numbers but then goes on to add \u201cat least they apply\nmathematical theories to bodies as if they (the bodies) consisted of\nthose numbers\u201d(Metaphysics 1083b16). The \u201cat\nleast\u201d and \u201cas if\u201d show that Aristotle is drawing an\ninference rather than referring to any explicit statement by the\nPythagoreans that things are numbers. Thus for Philolaus there are\nanalogies between numbers and things and numbers give us knowledge of\nthings but Aristotle mistakenly takes this to be equivalent to saying\nthat things are numbers or are made of numbers. Another approach is to\nargue that Aristotle was right that Philolaus and other Pythagoreans\nthought of the number one and other numbers as physical entities. The\none constructed in Philolaus Fr. 7 is not just the primal physical\nunity but also the number one (Schofield 2012). At the opposite\nextreme, Zhmud argues that Aristotle has essentially invented this\nPythagorean system with little regard for what any actual Pythagoreans\nsaid in order to serve as background for his account of Plato\u2019s\ntheory of principles (2012a, 438, 394\u2013414). Another approach\ntries to mitigate the differences between Philolaus and Aristotle and\nsuggests that Aristotle\u2019s emphasis on number was derived from\nPythagorean numerology that was independent of Philolaus but that was\ncombined with material from Philolaus as a result of Aristotle\u2019s\ndecision to present one mainstream Pythagorean system (Primavesi\n2012). \n2.4 The Pythagoreans of the Table of Opposites\n\nAt Metaphysics 986a22, after presenting his account of the\nphilosophy of \u201cthe so-called\u201d Pythagoreans (985b23), which\nhas strong connections to the philosophy of Philolaus, Aristotle turns\nto \u201cothers of this same group\u201d and assigns to them what is\ncommonly known as the table of opposites (the opposites arranged\naccording to column [kata sustoichian]). These Pythagoreans\npresented the principles of reality as consisting of ten pairs of\nopposites:\n\n\nlimit\nunlimited \n\nodd\neven \n\nunity\nplurality \n\nright\nleft \n\nmale\nfemale \n\nrest\nmotion \n\nstraight\u00a0\u00a0\ncrooked \n\nlight\ndarkness \n\ngood\nbad \n\nsquare\noblong \n\n\nAristotle then contrasts these Pythagoreans with Alcmaeon of Croton,\nwho said that the majority of human things come in pairs, and praises\nthe Pythagoreans for carefully defining the pairs of opposites both in\nnumber and character, whereas Alcmaeon seemed to present a randomly\nselected and ill-defined group of opposites. Aristotle suggests that\neither Alcmaeon was influenced by these Pythagoreans or they by him.\nAristotle was thus not sure of the date of these Pythagoreans but\nseems to entertain the idea that they either lived a little before\nAlcmaeon or a little after, which would make them active anywhere from\nthe late 6th to the mid 5th century. Aristotle\u2019s manner of\nintroducing these Pythagoreans suggests that they are distinct from\nPhilolaus and his pupil Eurytus and perhaps earlier (Schofield 2012:\n156), but it is not possible to be more specific about their identity.\nIt is possible that Aristotle only knows of the table through oral\ntransmission and that there were no specific names attached to it.\n\nThe table shows a strong normative slant by including good in one\ncolumn and bad in the other. In contrast, while Philolaus posits the\nfirst two opposites in the table, limit and unlimited, as first\nprinciples, there is no suggestion in the extant fragments of\nPhilolaus that limit was good and unlimited bad. Opposites played a\nlarge role in most Presocratic philosophical systems. The Pythagoreans\nwho posited the table of opposites differed from other early Greek\nphilosophers not only in the normative view of the opposites but also\nby including strikingly abstract pairs such as straight and crooked\nand odd and even, in contrast to the more concrete opposites such as\nhot and cold, which are typical elsewhere in early Greek philosophy.\nSimilar tables of opposites appear in the Academy (Aristotle,\nMetaph. 1093b11; EN 1106b29 referring to Speusippus;\nSimplicius in CAG IX. 247. 30ff.), and Aristotle himself\nseems at times to adopt such a table (Metaph. 1004b27 ff.;\nPhys. 201b25). Later Platonists and Neopythagoreans will\ncontinue to develop these tables (see Burkert 1972a, 52, n. 119 for a\nlist). The table of opposites thus provides one of the clearest cases\nof continuity between early Pythagoreanism and Platonism. Zhmud argues\nthat the table has little to do with early Pythagoreanism and is\nlargely a product of the Academy (2012: 449\u2013452), but\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of it in connection with Alcmaeon clearly\nshows that he regarded it as belonging to the fifth-century and it is\nimplausible to suppose that he confused the work of his contemporaries\nin the Academy with Pythagorean ideas that were developed over a\ncentury earlier. It may well be that the similarity between this\nPythagorean table of opposites and later Academic versions led to the\nNeopythagorean habit, starting already in the early Academy, of\nmistakenly assigning the fundamental pair of opposites in\nPlato\u2019s late metaphysics, the one and the indefinite dyad, back\nto Pythagoras (see on Neopythagoreanism below).\n2.5 Archytas\n\nSee the entry on\n Archytas.\n3. Other Pythagoreans of the Sixth, Fifth and Fourth Centuries\n3.1 The Catalogue of Pythagoreans in Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life: Who Counts as a Pythagorean?\n\nIamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life (4th c. CE) ends\nwith a catalogue of 218 Pythagorean men organized by city followed by\na list of 17 of the most famous Pythagorean women. Of these 235\nPythagoreans, 145 appear nowhere else in the ancient tradition. This\nimpressive list of names shows the wide impact of Pythagoreanism in\nthe fifth and fourth centuries BCE. To what extent is it reliable? A\nlong line of scholars has argued that the catalogue has close\nconnections to and is likely to be based on Aristoxenus in the fourth\ncentury BCE and is thus a reasonably accurate reflection of early\nPythagoreanism rather than a creation of the later Neopythagorean\ntradition (Rohde 1871\u20131872, 171; Diels 1965, 23;\nTimpanaro-Cardini 1958-1964, III 38 ff.; Burkert 1972a, 105, n. 40;\nZhmud 2012b, 235\u2013244). This is up to a point a reasonable\nconclusion, since it is hard to see who would have been better placed\nthan Aristoxenus to have such detailed information.\n\nThe arguments connecting Aristoxenus to the catalogue are not\nunassailable, however, and it is likely that the list has been altered\nin transmission, so that it cannot simply be accepted as the testimony\nof Aristoxenus (Huffman 2008a). No names on the list can be positively\nassigned to a date later than Aristoxenus, but this would be likely to\nbe true, even if the list were compiled at a later date, since\nPythagoreanism appears to have largely died out for the two centuries\nimmediately following Aristoxenus\u2019 death. Thus, Iamblichus does\nnot mention any Pythagorean who can be positively dated after the time\nof Aristoxenus anywhere else in On the Pythagorean Life\neither. Scholars have also argued that Iamblichus cannot have composed\nthe catalogue, since he mentions some 18 names that do not appear in\nthe catalogue. This argument would only work, if Iamblichus were a\ncareful and systematic author, which the repetitions and\ninconsistencies in On the Pythagorean Life show that he was\nnot. While it is unlikely that Iamblichus composed the catalogue from\nscratch, it is perfectly possible that he edited it in a number of\nways, while not feeling compelled to make it consistent with\neverything he says elsewhere in the text. There are some peculiarities\nof the catalogue that suggest a connection to Aristoxenus. Philolaus\nand Eurytus are listed not under Croton but under Tarentum, just as\nthey are in one of the Fragments of Aristoxenus (Fr. 19 Wehrli =\nDiogenes Laertius VIII 46). On the other hand, some features of the\ncatalogue are inconsistent with what we know of Aristoxenus.\nAristoxenus\u2019 teacher, Xenophilus, who is identified as from the\nThracian Chalcidice in the Fragments of Aristoxenus (Frs. 18 and 19\nWehrli), is identified as from Cyzicus in the catalogue. Moreover, the\nlegendary figure, Abaris, is included in the catalogue and even said\nto be from the mythical Hyperborea, whereas Aristoxenus is usually\nseen as resolutely trying to rationalize the Pythagorean tradition.\nThus, while Aristoxenus is quite plausibly taken to be the author of\nthe core of the catalogue, it is likely that additions, omissions, and\nvarious changes have been made to the original document and hence it\nis impossible to be sure, in most cases, whether a given name has the\nauthority of Aristoxenus behind it or not.\n\nThe catalogue includes several problematic names, such as Alcmaeon,\nEmpedocles, Parmenides and Melissus. Alcmaeon was active in Croton\nwhen the Pythagoreans flourished there, but Aristotle explicitly\ndistinguishes Alcmaeon from the Pythagoreans and scholarly consensus\nis that he is not a Pythagorean (see the entry on\n Alcmaeon).\n Most scholars would agree that Empedocles was heavily influenced by\nPythagoreanism; in the later tradition fragments of Empedocles are\nroutinely cited to support the Pythagorean doctrines of metempsychosis\nand vegetarianism (e.g., Sextus Empiricus, Adversus\nMathematicos IX 126\u201330). On the other hand, both in the\nancient and in the modern world, Empedocles is not usually labeled a\nPythagorean, because, whatever the initial Pythagorean influences, he\ndeveloped a philosophical system that was his own original\ncontribution. Parmenides is again not usually identified as a\nPythagorean in either the ancient or modern tradition and, although\nscholars have speculated on Pythagorean influences on Parmenides,\nthere is little that can be identified as overtly Pythagorean in his\nphilosophy. The reason for Parmenides\u2019 inclusion in the\ncatalogue is pretty clearly the tradition that his alleged teacher\nAmeinias was a Pythagorean (Diogenes Laertius IX 21). There is no\nreason to doubt this story, but it gives us no more reason to call\nParmenides a Pythagorean than to call Plato a Socratic or Aristotle a\nPlatonist. It would appear that Melissus was included on the list\nbecause he was regarded in turn as the pupil of Parmenides. Inclusion\nin the catalogue thus need not indicate that a figure lived a\nPythagorean way of life or that he adopted metaphysical principles\nthat were distinctively Pythagorean; he need only have had contact\nwith a Pythagorean teacher. It is possible that Aristoxenus included\nParmenides and Melissus on the list for these reasons or that he had\nbetter reasons for including them (e.g., evidence that they lived a\nPythagorean life), but it is precisely famous names such as these that\nwould be likely to have been added to the list in later times, and\nthey may well not have appeared in Aristoxenus\u2019 catalogue at\nall.\n\nZhmud (2012a, 109\u2013134) has argued that it begs the question to\nuse a doctrinal criterion to identify Pythagoreans. We need to first\nidentify Pythagoreans and then see what their doctrines are.\nAristoxenus\u2019 catalogue of Pythagoreans as preserved in\nIamblichus is the crucial source. Zhmud takes the Pythagoreans on this\nlist whom we can identify (the overwhelming majority are just names\nfor us) and studies their interests and activities in order to arrive\nat a picture of early Pythagoreanism. Of the 235 names Zhmud finds\nonly 15 about whom we know anything significant. Some of these are\nnon-controversial (Hippasus, Philolaus, Eurytus and Archytas).\nHowever, Zhmud puts particular emphasis on a series of figures not\ntypically regarded as Pythagoreans, e.g., Democedes, Alcmaeon, Iccus,\nMenestor,and Hippon. The range of interests of these figures leads him\nto conclude that there is no one characteristic that is shared by all\nPythagoreans and that Wittgestein\u2019s concept of a family\nresemblance should be employed to describe Pythagoreanism. Moreover,\nhis reliance on figures like Alcmaeon and Menestor leads him to the\nsurprising conclusion that natural science and medicine were more\nimportant than mathematics for the philosophical views of early\nPythagoreans (2012a, 23). The foundation for this view of early\nPythagoreanism is problematic since the scholarly consensus is that\nAlcmaeon was not a Pythagorean and it is also far from certain that\nMenestor was a Pythagorean (see below). As argued above,\nIamblichus\u2019 catalogue cannot be used mechanically as a guarantee\nthat a given figure was a Pythagorean, because we cannot be sure that\nit always reflects Aristoxenus. What criteria should then be used?\n\nFirst, anyone identified as a Pythagorean by an early source\nuncontaminated by the Neopythagorean glorification of Pythagoras (see\nbelow) can be regarded as a Pythagorean. This would include sources\ndating before the early Academy (ca. 350 BCE), where Neopythagoreanism\nhas its origin, and Peripatetic sources contemporary with the early\nAcademy (ca. 350\u2013300 BCE, e.g., Aristotle, Aristoxenus and\nEudemus), who, under the influence of Aristotle, defined themselves in\nopposition to the Academic view of Pythagoras.\n\nSecond, a doctrinal criterion is applicable. Anyone who espouses the\nphilosophy assigned to the Pythagoreans by Aristotle can be regarded\nas a Pythagorean, although Aristotle presents that philosophy under an\ninterpretation that must be taken into account. It is important that\nthe use of such a doctrinal criterion be limited to quite specific\ndoctrines such as limiters and unlimiteds as first principles and the\ncosmology that includes the counter-earth and central fire.\nParticularly to be avoided is the assumption that any early\nmathematician or any early figure who assigns mathematical ideas a\nrole in the cosmos is a Pythagorean. Mathematicians such as Theodorus\nof Cyrene (who is included in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue) and\nHippocrates of Chios (who is not) are not treated as Pythagoreans in\nthe early sources such as Plato, Aristotle and Eudemus, and there is\naccordingly no good reason to call them Pythagoreans. Similarly, the\nsculptor, Polyclitus of Argos, stated that \u201cthe good comes to be\n\u2026 through many numbers,\u201d (Fr. 2 DK), but no ancient\nsource calls him a Pythagorean (Huffman 2002). As Burkert has\nemphasized, mathematics is a Greek and not just a specifically\nPythagorean passion (1972a, 427).\n\nThird, anyone universally (or almost universally) called a Pythagorean\nby later sources, and whom early sources do not treat as independent\nof Pythagoreanism, explicitly or implicitly, can be regarded as a\nPythagorean. This would include figures embedded in the biographical\ntradition about Pythagoras and the early Pythagoreans, such as the\nhusband and wife, Myllias and Timycha.\n\nThis last criterion is more subjective than the first two and\ndifficult cases arise. The fifth-century botanist Menestor (DK I 375)\nis discussed by Theophrastus and called one of \u201cthe old natural\nphilosophers\u201d (CP VI 3.5) with no mention of any\nPythagoreanism. In this case, the inclusion of a Menestor in\nIamblichus\u2019 catalogue is not enough reason to regard\nTheophrastus\u2019 Menestor as a Pythagorean. On the other hand,\nalthough Aristotle treats Hippasus separately from the Pythagoreans,\nas he does Archytas, the almost universal identification of Hippasus\nas a Pythagorean in the later tradition and his deep involvement in\nthe biography of early Pythagoreanism, show that he should be regarded\nas a Pythagorean (on Hippasus, see section 3.4 below). The\nfifth-century figure Hippo (DK I 385), who is derided by Aristotle and\npaired with Thales as positing water as the first principle\n(Metaph. 984a3), is a particularly difficult case. An Hippo\nis listed in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue under Samos and Censorinus\ntells us that Aristoxenus assigned Hippo to Samos rather than\nMetapontum (DK I 385.4\u20135). This makes it look as if Aristoxenus\nmay be responsible for including Hippo in the catalogue. Burkert has\nalso tried to demonstrate connections between Hippo\u2019s philosophy\nand that of the Pythagoreans (1972a, 290, n. 62). On the other hand,\nneither Aristotle nor Theophrastus nor any of the Aristotelian\ncommentators call him a Pythagorean and the doxographers describe this\nHippo as from Rhegium (e.g., Hippolytus in DK I 385.17). It is thus\nnot clear whether we are dealing with one person or two people named\nHippo and it is doubtful that the Hippo discussed by the Peripatetics\nwas a Pythagorean (Zhmud regards Hippo as well as Menestor and\nTheodorus as Pythagoreans \u2014 2012a, 126\u2013128). Those figures\nof the sixth, fifth and fourth century who have the best claim to be\nconsidered Pythagoreans will be discussed in the following\nsections.\n3.2 The Earliest Pythagoreans: Brontinus, Theano, etc.\n\nIn the standard collection of the fragments and testimonia of the\nPresocratics, Cercops, Petron, Brontinus, Hippasus, Calliphon,\nDemocedes, and Parmeniscus are listed as older Pythagoreans (DK I\n105\u2013113). Hippasus, who is the most important of these figures,\nwill be discussed separately below (sect. 3.4). Of the rest only\nBrontinus, Calliphon and Parmeniscus appear in Iamblichus\u2019\ncatalogue.\n\nBrontinus is presented as either the husband or father of Theano (see\nsection 3.3 below). Brontinus (DK I 106\u2013107) is elsewhere said\nto have had a wife Deino and to be either from Metapontum or Croton.\nLittle is known about him, but his existence appears to be confirmed\nby Alcmaeon, writing in the late sixth or early fifth century, who\naddresses his book to a Brontinus along with Leon and Bathyllus (Fr. 1\nDK). The latter two may also be Pythagoreans, since a Leon is listed\nunder Metapontum and a Bathylaus (sic) under Posidonia, in\nIamblichus\u2019 catalogue.\n\nThe elusive connection between Orphism and Pythagoreanism rears its\nhead with Brontinus. In late antiquity there was a consensus that\nPythagoras himself had been initiated into the Orphic mysteries and\nderived much of his philosophy from Orphism (Proclus, Commentary\non Plato\u2019s Timaeus, 3.168.8). Authors of the fifth century\nBCE know of no such initiation and often indicate that the influence\nwent the other way by reporting that Pythagoras was, in fact, the\nauthor of supposed Orphic texts (Ion of Chios as reported in Diog.\nLaert. 8.8). Similarly, the fourth-century author, Epigenes, reports\nthat Brontinus is supposed to be the real author of two works\ncirculating in the name of Orpheus (West 1983, 9 ff.). In the end it\nis impossible to determine the relationship between Pythagoreanism and\nOrphism because of the difficulty of defining either movement\nprecisely (see Betegh 2014).\n\nCercops (DK I 105\u2013106) is an even more obscure figure who is,\nagain according to Epigenes, the supposed Pythagorean author of Orphic\ntexts (West 1983, 9, 248), although Burkert doubts that he was a\nPythagorean (1972a, 130).\n\nTo Petron (DK I 106) is ascribed the startling doctrine that there are\n183 worlds arranged in a triangle, but he is only known from a passage\nin Plutarch, is not called a Pythagorean there and is probably a\nliterary fiction (Guthrie 1962, 322\u2013323; Burkert 1972a, 114;\nZhmud 2012a, 117).\n\nA Parmeniscus (DK I 112\u2013113) is called a Pythagorean by Diogenes\nLaertius (IX 20) and may be the same as the Parmiskos listed under\nMetapontum in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue. Athenaeus reports that a\nParmeniscus of Metapontum lost the ability to laugh after descending\ninto the cave of Trophonius, only to recover it in a temple on Delos,\nwhere the surviving inventory of the temple of Artemis records a\ndedication of a cup by a Parmiskos (Burkert 1972a, 154).\n\nThere no good reason to think that Democedes (DK I 110\u2013112), the\nphysician from Croton, was himself a Pythagorean, although he had some\nPythagorean connections. He is famous from Herodotus\u2019 account\n(III 125 ff.) of his service to the tyrant, Polycrates, and the\nPersian king, Darius. One late source names him a Pythagorean (DK I\n112.21). Iamblichus mentions a Pythagorean named Democedes, who was\ninvolved in the political turmoil surrounding the conspiracy of Cylon\nagainst the Pythagoreans, but it is far from clear that this was the\nphysician (VP 257\u2013261). Herodotus never calls Democedes\na Pythagorean nor do any other of the later sources (e.g., Aelian,\nAthenaeus, the Suda), nor does he appear in Iamblichus\u2019\ncatalogue. A Calliphon, who could be Democedes\u2019 father, is\npresented as an associate of Pythagoras by Hermippus (DK I 111.36 ff.)\nand appears in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue, so it is reasonable to\nregard him as a Pythagorean, although we know nothing more of him. It\nis reported (Herodotus III 137) that Democedes married the daughter of\nthe Olympic victor, Milon, who was the Pythagorean, whose house was\nused as a meeting place (Iamblichus, VP 249). It was\nundoubtedly because Democedes came from Croton at roughly the time\nwhen Pythagoras was prominent there and because of the Pythagorean\nconnections of his father and father-in-law that late sources came to\nlabel Democedes himself a Pythagorean. For an argument that Democedes\nwas a Pythagorean see Zhmud 2012a, 120.\n3.3 Pythagorean Women\n\nWomen were probably more active in Pythagoreanism than any other\nancient philosophical movement. The evidence is not extensive but is\nsufficient to give us a glimpse of their role. At the end of the\ncatalogue of Pythagoreans in Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean\nLife, after the list of 218 male Pythagoreans, the names of 17\nPythagorean women are given (VP 267). Since this list is\nlikely to be based on the work of Aristoxenus, it probably represents\nwhat Aristoxenus learned from fourth-century Pythagoreans, although we\ncannot, of course, be certain that some names were not inserted into\nthe list after the time of Aristoxenus (see section 3.1 above). Eleven\nare identified as the wife, daughter or sister of a man but seven are\nsimply identified by their region or city-state of origin, although\nthe Echecrateia of Phlius listed seems likely to be connected to the\nEchecrates of Phlius who appears in Plato\u2019s Phaedo. We\nknow nothing else about most of the names on the list and thus cannot\nbe sure in individual cases whether they belong to the sixth, fifth or\nfourth century. For a speculative reconstruction of the role of women\nin the Pythagorean society see Rowett (2014, 122\u2013123), but this\nreconstruction partly depends on the speech that Iamblichus reports\nPythagoras gave to the women of Croton upon his arrival (VP\n54\u201357); however, while Pythagoras did give speeches to different\ngroups, including women, the text of the speech in Iamblichus is\nprobably a later fabrication (Burkert 1972a, 115; Zhmud 2012a, 70).\nThe Pythagoreans put particular emphasis on marital fidelity on the\npart of both men and women (Gemelli Marciano 2014, 145). There is also\nno reliable evidence for any writings by these women, although in the\nlater tradition works were forged in the names of some of them and of\nother Pythagorean women not on the list (see section 4.2 below). \n\nThe most famous name on the list is Theano who is here called the wife\nof Brontinus but who is elsewhere treated as either the wife, daughter\nor pupil of Pythagoras (Diogenes Laertius VIII 42; Burkert 1972a,\n114). The role of women in early Pythagoreanism and the centrality of\nTheano is further attested by Aristoxenus\u2019 contemporary,\nDicaearchus, who reports that Pythagoras had as followers not just men\nbut also women and that one of these, Theano, became famous (Fr. 40\nMirhday = Porphyry, VP 19). It is striking that Dicaearchus\ndoes not identify her as the wife of either Brontius or Pythagoras but\nsimply as a follower of Pythagoras. In the later tradition a number of\nworks were forged in her name (see section 4.2 below), but we have\nlittle reliable evidence about her (see Thesleff 1965, 193\u2013201,\nfor testimonia and texts; Delatte 1922, 246\u2013249; and Montepaone\n1993). The second most famous name on the list is Timycha who, when\nten months pregnant, reportedly bit off her own tongue so that she\ncould not, under torture, reveal Pythagorean secrets to the tyrant\nDionysius (Iamblichus, VP 189\u2013194). This story goes\nback to Neanthes, writing in the late fourth or early third century\nand may rely on local Pythagorean tradition (Schorn 2014, 310).\n3.4 Hippasus and Other Fifth-century Pythagoreans: acusmatici and  math\u00eamatici\n\nHippasus is a crucial figure in the history of Pythagoreanism, because\nthe tradition about him suggests that even in the fifth century there\nwas debate within the Pythagorean tradition itself as to whether\nPythagoras was largely important as the founder of a set of rules to\nfollow in living one\u2019s life or whether his teaching also had a\nmathematical and scientific dimension. Hippasus was probably from\nMetapontum (Aristotle, Metaph. 984a7; Diogenes Laertius VIII\n84), although Iamblichus says there was controversy as to whether he\nwas from Metapontum or Croton (VP 81), and he is listed under\nSybaris in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue (VP 267). He is\nconsistently portrayed as a rebel in the Pythagorean tradition, in one\ncase a democratic rebel who challenged the aristocratic Pythagorean\nleadership in Croton (Iamb. VP 257), but more commonly as the\nthinker who initiated Pythagorean study of mathematics and the natural\nworld.\n\nIt is in this latter role that he is connected with the split between\ntwo groups in ancient Pythagoreanism, the acusmatici (who\nemphasized rules for living one\u2019s life, including various\ntaboos) and the math\u00eamatici (who emphasized study of\nmathematics and the natural world). Each group claimed to be the true\nPythagoreans. Our knowledge of this split comes from Iamblichus, who\nunfortunately presents two contradictory versions, with the result\nthat Hippasus is sometimes said to be one of the\nmath\u00eamatici and sometimes one of the\nacusmatici. Burkert has convincingly shown that the correct\nversion is that reported by Iamblichus at De Communi Mathematica\nScientia 76.19 ff. (1972a, 192 ff.). According to this account,\nthe acusmatici denied that the math\u00eamatici\nwere Pythagoreans at all, saying that their philosophy derived from\nHippasus instead. The math\u00eamatici for their part, while\nrecognizing that the acusmatici were Pythagoreans of a sort,\nargued that they themselves were Pythagoreans in a truer sense.\nHippasus\u2019 supposed innovations, they said, were in fact\nplagiarisms from Pythagoras himself. The math\u00eamatici\nexplained that, upon Pythagoras\u2019 arrival in Italy, the leading\nmen in the cities did not have time to learn the sciences and the\nproofs of what Pythagoras said, so that Pythagoras just gave them\ninstructions on how to act, without explaining the reasons. The\nyounger men, who did have the leisure to devote to study, learned the\nmathematical sciences and the proofs. The former group were the first\nacusmatici, who learned the oral instructions of Pythagoras\non how to live (the acusmata = \u201cthings heard\u201d),\nwhile the latter group were the first math\u00eamatici.\nHippasus was thus closely connected to the math\u00eamatici\nin this split in Pythagoreanism but ended up being disavowed by both\nsides. For an attempt to further characterize the\nmath\u00eamatici see Horky 2013.\n\nIt is difficult to be sure of Hippasus\u2019 dates, but he is\ntypically regarded as active in the first half of the fifth century\nand perhaps early in that period (Burkert 1972a, 206; Zhmud 2012a,\n124\u2013125). The split in Pythagoreanism may have occurred after\nthe main period of his work and was perhaps connected to the attacks\non the Pythagorean societies by outsiders around 450 BCE (Burkert\n1972a, 207), but certainty is not possible. Zhmud (2012a,\n169\u2013192) has argued that the split is an invention of the later\ntradition, appearing first in Clement of Alexandria and disappearing\nafter Iamblichus. He also notes that the term  acusmata\nappears first in Iamblichus (On the Pythagorean Life\n82\u201386) and suggests that it also is a creation of the later\ntradition. He admits that the Pythagorean maxims did exist earlier, as\nthe testimony of Aristotle shows, but they were known as\nsymbola, were originally very few in number and were mainly a\nliterary phenomenon rather than being tied to people who actually\npracticed them (Zhmud 2012a, 192\u2013195). The consensus view, which\naccepts the split, is based on Burkert\u2019s argument that\nIamblichus\u2019account of the split between the acusmatici\nand math\u00eamatici can be shown to be derived from\nAristotle (1972a, 196). Burkert later reaffirmed this position,\nalthough with a little less confidence, asserting that the\nAristotelian provenance of the text is \u201cas obvious as it is\nunprovable\u201d (1998, 315). Indeed the description of the split in\nwhat is likely to be the original version (Iamblichus, On General\nMathematical Science 76.16\u201377.18) uses language in\ndescribing the Pythagoreans that is almost an Aristotelian signature,\n\u201cThere are two forms of the Italian philosophy which is called\nPythagorean\u201d (76.16). Aristotle famously describes the\nPythagoreans as \u201cthose called Pythagoreans\u201d and also as\n\u201cthe Italians\u201d (e.g., Mete. 342b30,\nCael. 293a20). Thus, Aristotle remains the most likely\nsource. Zhmud also argues against the split on the grounds that there\nare no individuals in the historical record that can be confidently\nidentified as acusmatici. Since the acusmatici were\nneither original nor full-time philosophers, however, and simply\npreserved the oral taboos handed down by Pythagoras, it is not\nsurprising that they are not singled out for attention in the sources.\nOnly a relatively small number of the names in Iamblichus\u2019\ncatalogue can certainly be identified as math\u00eamatici\nand most of the others, particularly the 145 individuals whose names\nare only known from the catalogue, are likely to be\nacusmatici, who to a greater or lesser degree followed the\nPythagorean acusmata, but left no other trace of their\nactivity. In addition, a number of other Pythagoreans of the fifth and\nfourth century, who figure in anecdotes about the Pythagorean life are\nlikely to be acusmatici (see below). \n\nHippasus is the first figure in the Pythagorean tradition who can with\nsome confidence be identified as a natural philosopher, mathematician\nand music theorist. His connections are as much with figures outside\nthe Pythagorean tradition as those within it. This independence may\nexplain why neither Aristotle nor the doxographical tradition label\nhim a Pythagorean, but he is too deeply embedded in the traditions\nabout early Pythagoreanism for there to be any doubt that he was in\nsome sense a Pythagorean. Aristotle pairs Hippasus with Heraclitus as\npositing fire as the primary element (Metaph. 984a7) and this\npairing is repeated in the doxography that descends from Theophrastus\n(DK I 109. 5\u201316), according to which Hippasus also said that the\nsoul was made of fire. Philolaus, who was probably two generations\nlater than Hippasus, might have been influenced by Hippasus in\nstarting his cosmology with the central fire (Fr. 7). For Philolaus,\nhowever, the central fire is a compound of limiter and unlimited,\nwhereas Hippasus is presented as a monist and does not start from\nPhilolaus\u2019 fundamental opposition between limiters and\nunlimiteds.\n\nThere are only a few other assertions about the cosmology of Hippasus\nand most of these seem to be the result of Peripatetic attempts to\nclassify him, such as the assertions that he makes all things from\nfire by condensation and rarefaction and dissolves all things into\nfire, which is the one underlying nature and that he and Heraclitus\nregarded the universe as one, (always) moving and limited in extent\n(DK I 109.8\u201310). More intriguing is the claim that he thought\nthere was \u201ca fixed time for the change of the cosmos\u201d\n(Diogenes Laertius VIII 84), which might be a reference to a doctrine\nof eternal recurrence, according to which events exactly repeat\nthemselves at fixed periods of time. This doctrine is attested\nelsewhere for Pythagoras (Dicaearchus in Porphyry, VP 19).\nOur information about Hippasus is sketchy, because he evidently did\nnot write a book. Demetrius of Magnesia (1st century BCE) reports that\nHippasus left nothing behind in writing (Diogenes Laertius VIII 84)\nand this is in accord with the tradition that Philolaus was the first\nPythagorean to write a book.\n\nHippasus originates the early Pythagorean tradition of scientific and\nmathematical analysis of music, which reaches its culmination in\nArchytas a century later. The correspondence between the central\nmusical concords of the octave, fifth, and fourth and the whole number\nratios 2 : 1, 3 : 2 and 4 : 3 is reflected in the acusmata\n(Iamblichus, VP 82) and was thus probably already known by\nPythagoras. This correspondence was central to Philolaus\u2019\nconception of the cosmos (Fr. 6a). Although the later tradition tried\nto assign the discovery to Pythagoras himself (Iamblichus, VP\n115), the method described in the story would not in fact have worked\n(Burkert 1972a, 375\u2013376). Hippasus is the first person to whom\nis assigned an experiment demonstrating these correspondences that is\nscientifically possible. Aristoxenus (Fr. 90 Wehrli = DK I 109. 31\nff.) reports that Hippasus prepared four bronze disks of equal\ndiameters, whose thicknesses were in the given ratios, and it is true\nthat, if free hanging disks of equal diameter are struck, the sound\nproduced by, e.g., a disk half as thick as another will be an octave\napart from the sound produced by the other disk (Burkert 1972a, 377).\nHippasus, thus, may be the first person to devise an experiment to\nshow that a physical law can be expressed mathematically (Zhmud 2012a,\n310).\n\nAnother text associates Hippasus with Lasus of Hermione in an attempt\nto demonstrate the correspondence by filling vessels with liquid in\nthe appropriate ratios. It is less clear whether this experiment would\nhave worked as described (Barker 1989, 31\u201332). Lasus was\nprominent in Athens in the second half of the sixth century at the\ntime of the Pisistratid tyranny and was thus probably a generation\nolder than Hippasus. There is no indication that Lasus was a\nPythagorean and this testimony suggests that the discovery of and\ninterest in the mathematical basis of the concordant musical intervals\nwas not limited to the Pythagorean tradition. Lasus and Hippasus are\nsometimes said to have been the first to put forth the influential but\nmistaken thesis that the pitch of a sound depended on the speed with\nwhich it travels, but it is far more likely that Archytas originated\nthis view. In the later tradition Hippasus is reported to have ranked\nthe musical intervals in terms of degrees of concordance, making the\noctave the most concordant, followed by the fifth, octave + fifth,\nfourth and double octave (Boethius, Mus. II 19).\n\nFinally, Iamblichus associates Hippasus with the history of the\ndevelopment of the mathematics of means (DK I 110. 30\u201337), which\nare important in music theory, but Iamblichus\u2019 reports are\nconfused. It is likely that Hippasus worked only with the three\nearliest means (the arithmetic, geometric and subcontrary/harmonic)\nand that the changing of the name of the subcontrary mean to the\nharmonic mean should be ascribed to Archytas rather than Hippasus\n(Huffman 2005, 179\u2013173).\n\nThe most romantic aspect of the tradition concerning Hippasus is the\nreport that he drowned at sea in punishment for the impiety of making\npublic and giving a diagram of the dodecahedron, a figure with twelve\nsurfaces each in the shape of a regular pentagon (Iamblichus,\nVP 88). This is best understood as reflecting some sort of\nmathematical analysis of the dodecahedron by Hippasus, but it is\nimplausible in terms of the history of Greek mathematics to suppose\nthat he carried out a strict construction of the dodecahedron, which\nalong with the other four regular solids is most likely to have first\nreceived rigorous treatment by Theaetetus in the fourth century BCE\n(Mueller 1997, 277; Waterhouse 1972; Sachs1917, 82). Nor is it clear\nwhy public presentation of technical mathematical analysis should\ncause a scandal, since few people would understand it. The most likely\nexplanation is that the dodecahedron was a cult object for the\nPythagoreans (dodecahedra in stone and bronze have been found dating\nback to prehistoric times) and that it was because of these religious\nconnections that Hippasus\u2019 public work on the mathematical\naspects of the solid was seen as impious (Burkert 1972a, 460).\n\nAnother late story, which appears first in Plutarch, reports a scandal\nwhich arose when knowledge of irrational magnitudes was revealed,\nwithout specifying any punishment for the one who revealed it\n(Numa 22). In Pappus\u2019 later version of the story, the\nperson who first spread knowledge of the existence of the irrational\nwas punished by drowning (Junge and Thomson 1930, 63\u201364).\nIamblichus knows two different versions of the story, one according to\nwhich the malefactor was banished and a tomb was erected for him,\nsignifying his expulsion from the community (VP 246), but\nanother according to which he was punished by drowning as was the\nperson (not specifically said to be Hippasus here) who revealed the\ndodecahedron (VP 247). Modern scholars have tried to combine\nthe two stories and suppose that Hippasus discovered the irrational\nthrough his work on the dodecahedron (von Fritz 1945). This is pure\nspeculation, however, since neither does any ancient source connect\nHippasus to the discovery of the irrational nor does any source relate\nthe discovery of the irrational to the dodecahedron (Burkert 1972a,\n459). Some scholars nonetheless credit Hippasus with the discovery of\nirrationality (Zhmud 2012a, 274\u2013278).\n\nSome have argued that Hippasus was an important figure for the early\nAcademy to whom Academic doctrines were ascribed in order give them\nhis authority and even that he might be the Prometheus mentioned by\nPlato as handing down the method from the gods in the\nPhilebus (Horky 2013). However, there is no explicit mention\nof Hippasus by any member of the Academy and he is a minor figure in\nfourth-century accounts of early Greek philosophy (e.g., Aristotle) so\nit is hard to see what authority he could give to Academic views. \n\nThe other major Pythagoreans of the fifth century were Philolaus and\nEurytus, who are discussed above.\n\nThe name, but not too much more, is known of a number of other fifth\ncentury figures, who with varying degrees of probability may be\nconsidered Pythagoreans. To the beginning of the fifth century belongs\nAmeinias the teacher of Parmenides (Diogenes Laertius VIII 21). The\nathlete and trainer, Iccus of Tarentum, is listed in Iamblichus\u2019\ncatalogue, but none of the other sources, including Plato, call him a\nPythagorean. In the later tradition, he was famous for the simplicity\nof his life and \u201cthe dinner of Iccus\u201d was proverbial for\nplain fare. Plato praises his self control and reports that he touched\nneither women nor boys while training. (Laws 839e; see\nProtagoras 316d and DK I 216. 11 ff.).\n\nSome scholars have treated the Sicilian comic poet Epicharmus as a\nPythagorean and argued that the growing argument which appears in a\nfragment of controversial authenticity ascribed to him in Diogenes\nLaertius (3.11) is thus Pythagorean in origin (Horky 2013,\n131\u2013140). However, no fifth- or fourth-century source identifies\nEpicharmus as a Pythagorean and he does not appear in the catalogue of\nIamblichus. The earliest explicit mention of him as a Pythagorean is\nin Plutarch (Numa 9) in the first century CE. There is no\ncompelling evidence that the reference to Epicharmus as a Pythagorean\nin Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life 266 derives from\nthe fourth-century historian Timaeus as Horky proposes (2013, 116).\nBurkert suggests that the information on Didorus in 266 might derive\nfrom Timaeus (1972, 203\u2013204) but Iamblichus regularly combines\nmaterial from a number of sources so that neither Burkert nor most\nscholars regard the passage as a whole as deriving from Timaeus\n(Schorn 2014 only mentions VP 254\u2013264 as having material from\nTimaeus). Epicharmus has also been thought to be a Pythagorean because\nthe growing argument which he uses for comic effect uses pebbles to\nrepresent numbers and refers to odd and even numbers. However, neither\nof the features is peculiarly Pythagorean; the concept of odd and even\nnumbers belongs to Greek mathematics in general and not just to the\nPythagoreans and the use of counters (pebbles) on an abacus is the\nstandard way in which Greeks manipulated numbers (Netz 2014, 178; cf.\nBurkert\u2019s doubts that there is anything Pythagorean in the\nEpicharmus fragment 1972a, 438). Most scholars regard\nEpicharmus\u2019 Pythagoreanism as a creation of the later tradition\n(Zhmud 2012a, 118; Riedweg 2005, 115; Kahn 2001, 87). \n\nThere is no reason to regard the physician Acron of Acragas as a\nPythagorean, as Zhmud does (1997, 73; he appears to have changed his\nmind in 2012a, 116). Acron is a contemporary of Empedocles and is\nconnected to him in the doxographical tradition (DK I 283. 1\u20139;\nDiogenes Laertius VIII 65). No ancient source calls him a Pythagorean.\nHis name appears in a very lacunose papyrus along with the name of\nAristoxenus (Aristoxenus, Fr. 22 Wehrli), but it is pure speculation\nthat Aristoxenus labeled him a Pythagorean; Euryphon the Cnidian\ndoctor of the fifth century, who was not a Pythagorean, also appears\nin the papyrus. Acron\u2019s father\u2019s name was Xenon, and a\nXenon appears in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue, but he is listed as from\nLocri and not Acragas, so again this is not good evidence that Acron\nwas a Pythagorean.\n\nThe Pythagorean Paron (DK I 217. 10\u201315) is probably a fiction\nresulting from a misreading of Aristotle (Burkert 1972a, 170).\nAristotle reports the expression of a certain Xuthus, that \u201cthe\nuniverse would swell like the ocean,\u201d if there were not void\ninto which parts of the universe could withdraw, when compressed\n(Physics 216b25). Simplicius says, on unknown grounds, that\nthis Xuthus was a Pythagorean, and scholars have speculated that he\nwas responding to Parmenides (DK I. 376. 20\u201326; Kirk and Raven\n1957, 301\u2013302; Barnes 1982, 616).\n\nAristoxenus reports that two Tarentines, Lysis and Archippus, were the\nsole survivors when the house of Milo in Croton was burned, during a\nmeeting of the Pythagoreans, by their enemies (Iamblichus, VP\n250). A later romantic version in Plutarch (On the Sign of\nSocrates 583a) has it that Lysis and Philolaus were the two\nsurvivors, but it appears that the famous name of Philolaus has been\nsubstituted for Archippus, about whom nothing else is known.\nAristoxenus goes on to say that Lysis left southern Italy and went\nfirst to Achaea in the Peloponnese before finally settling in Thebes,\nwhere the famous Theban general, Epaminondas, became his pupil and\ncalled him father. In order to be the teacher of Epaminondas in the\nearly fourth century, Lysis must have been born no earlier than about\n470. Thus the conflagration that he escaped as a young man must have\nbeen part of the attacks on the Pythagoreans around 450, rather than\nthose that occurred around 500, when Pythagoras himself was still\nalive. The later sources often conflate these two attacks on the\nPythagoreans (Minar 1942, 53). Nothing is known of the philosophy of\nLysis, but it seems probable that he should be regarded as one of the\nacusmatici, since his training of Epaminondas appears to have\nemphasized a way of life rather than mathematical or scientific\nstudies (Diodorus Siculus X 11.2) and Epaminondas\u2019 use of the\nname father for Lysis suggests a cult association (Burkert 1972a,\n179). In the later tradition, Lysis became quite famous as the author\nof a spurious letter (Thesleff 1965, 111; cf. Iamblichus, VP\n75\u201378) rebuking a certain Hipparchus for revealing Pythagorean\nteachings to the uninitiated (see on the Pythagorean pseudepigrapha\nbelow, sect. 4.2).\n\nZopyrus of Tarentum is mentioned twice, in a treatise on siege-engines\nby Biton (3rd or 2nd century BCE), as the inventor of an advanced form\nof the type of artillery known as the belly-bow (Marsden 1971,\n74\u201377). Zopyrus\u2019 bow used a winch to pull back the string\nand hence could shoot a six-foot wooden missile 4.5 inches thick\n(Marsden 1969, 14). It is not implausible to suppose that this is the\nsame Zopyrus as is listed in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue of\nPythagoreans under Tarentum (Diels 1965, 23), although Biton does not\ncall him a Pythagorean. The traditional dating for Zopyrus puts him in\nthe first half of the fourth century (Marsden 1971, 98, n. 52), but\nKingsley has convincingly argued that he was in fact active in the\nlast quarter of the fifth century, when he designed artillery for\nCumae and Miletus (1995, 150 ff.). In a famous passage, Diodorus\nreports that in 399 BCE Dionysius I, the tyrant of Syracuse, gathered\ntogether skilled craftsmen from Italy, Greece and Carthage in order to\nconstruct artillery for his war with the Carthaginians (XIV 41.3). It\nseems not unlikely that Zopyrus was one of those who came from Italy.\nThere is no reason to suppose, however, as Kingsley (1995, 146) and\nothers do, that Zopyrus\u2019 interest in mechanics was connected to\nhis Pythagoreanism or that there was a specifically Pythagorean school\nof mechanics in Tarentum (Huffman 2005, 14\u201317).\n\nIt is controversial whether this Zopyrus of Tarentum is the same as\nZopyrus of Heraclea, who is not called a Pythagorean in the sources,\nbut who is reported in late sources to have written three Orphic\npoems, The Net, The Robe and The Krater,\nwhich probably dealt with the structure of human beings and the earth\n(West 1983, 10 ff.). This Zopyrus could be from the Heraclea closely\nconnected to Tarentum, but he might also be from the Heraclea on the\nBlack Sea. A late source connects Zopyrus of Heraclea with Pisistratus\nin the 6th century (West 1983, 249), which would mean that he could\nnot be the same as Zopyrus of Tarentum in the late 5th century. On the\nother hand, Orphic writings are assigned to a number of other\nPythagoreans, and it is not impossible that the same person had\ninterests both in Orphic mysticism and mechanics. Kingsley supposes\nthat the myth at the end of Plato\u2019s Phaedo is based in\nminute detail on Zopyrus\u2019 Krater or an intermediary\nreworking of it (1995, 79\u2013171), and tries to connect specific\nfeatures of the myth to Zopyrus\u2019 interest in mechanics (1995,\n147\u2013148), but the parallel which he detects between the\noscillation of the rivers in the mythic account of the underworld and\nthe balance of opposing forces used in a bow is too general to be\ncompelling. The connection between Zopyrus and the Phaedo is\nhighly conjectural and must remain so, as long as there are no\nfragments of the Krater, with which to compare the\nPhaedo.\n\nA harmonic theorist named Simus is accused of having plagiarized one\nof seven pieces of wisdom inscribed on a bronze votive offering, which\nwas dedicated in the temple of Hera on Pythagoras\u2019 native island\nof Samos, by Pythagoras\u2019 supposed son Arimnestus (Duris of Samos\nin Porphyry, VP 3). There is a Simus listed under Posidonia\n(Paestum in S. Italy) in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue of Pythagoreans,\nso that DK treated him as a Pythagorean (I 444\u2013445) who, like\nHippasus, stole some of the master\u2019s teaching for his own glory.\nThere is, however, no obvious connection between the two individuals\nnamed Simus except the name. Most scholars have thus treated Simus as\nif he were a harmonic theorist in competition with and independent of\nthe Pythagorean tradition (Burkert 1972a, 449\u2013450; Zhmud 2012a,\n118; West 1992, 79 and 240; Wilamowitz 1962, II 93\u201394).\n\nWhat exactly he stole is very unclear. He is said to have removed\nseven pieces of wisdom from the monument and put forth one of them as\nhis own. This is perhaps best understood as meaning that he took an\ninscribed piece of metal from the dedicated object, perhaps a cauldron\n(see Wilamowitz 1962, II 94). The inscription will have included all\nseven pieces of wisdom, but Simus chose to publish only one of them as\nhis own, the other six being thus lost. The piece of wisdom he put\nforth as his own is called a kan\u00f4n\n(\u201crule\u201d). West takes this as a reference to the monochord,\nwhich was called the kan\u00f4n, used to determine and\nillustrate the numerical ratios, which were related to the concordant\nintervals (1992, 240). Since, however, the kan\u00f4n seems\nto have been something inscribed on the dedication, along with six\nother pieces of wisdom, it is perhaps better to assume that the\nkan\u00f4n was a description of a set of ratios determining\na scale (Burkert 1972a, 455; Wilamowitz 1962, 94). There must have\nbeen a scale in circulation associated with the name of Simus. The\nstory that Duris reports is then an attempt by the Pythagoreans to\nclaim this scale as, in fact, the work of Pythagoras or his son, which\nSimus plagiarized. Duris wrote in the first part of the third century\nBCE, so Simus has to be earlier than that. If the son of Pythagoras\nreally made the dedication in the temple, this would have occurred in\nthe fifth century, but it is unclear how much later than that\nSimus\u2019 kan\u00f4n became known. West dates him to the\nfifth century, whereas DK places him in the fourth. Zhmud suspects\nthat he is an invention of the pseudo\u2013Pythagorean tradition\n(2012a, 118).\n\nIamblichus describes an \u2018arithmetical method\u2019 known as the\nbloom of Thymaridas (In Nic. 62), and elsewhere discusses two\npoints of terminology in Thymaridas, including his definition of the\nmonad as \u201climiting quantity\u201d (In Nic. 11 and 27).\nSome scholars have dated Thymaridas to the time of Plato or before,\nbut others argue that the terminology assigned to him cannot be\nearlier than Plato and shows connections to Diophantus in the third\ncentury CE (see Burkert 1972a, 442, n. 92 for a summary of the\nscholarship). There is also a Thymaridas in the biographical\ntradition, who may or may not be the same individual. In a highly\nsuspect passage in Iamblichus, Thymarides is listed as a pupil of\nPythagoras himself (VP 104) and a Thymaridas of Paros appears\nin Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue and is mentioned in one anecdote\n(VP 239). There is also a worrisome connection to the\npseudo-Pythagorean literature. A Thymaridas of Tarentum is presented\nin an anecdote (Iamblichus, VP 145) as arguing that people\nshould wish for what the gods give them rather than praying that the\ngods give them what they want, a sentiment that is also found in a\ngroup of three treatises forged in Pythagoras\u2019 name (Diogenes\nLaertius VIII 9). The anecdote is drawn from Androcydes\u2019 work on\nthe Pythagorean symbola or taboos. If this work could be\ndated to the fourth century, it would confirm an early date for\nThymaridas, but all that is certain is that Androcydes\u2019 work was\nknown in the first century BCE and thus that the anecdote originated\nbefore that date (Burkert 1972a, 167). It seems rash, given this\nconfused evidence, to follow Zhmud and regard Thymaridas as a younger\ncontemporary or pupil of Archytas (2012a, 131).\n3.5 The Fourth Century: Aristoxenus, the Last of the Pythagoreans, and the Pythagorists\n\nAristoxenus (ca. 375- ca. 300 BCE) is most famous as a music theorist\nand as a member of the Lyceum, who was disappointed not be to named\nAristotle\u2019s successor (Fr. 1 Wehrli). In his early years,\nhowever, he was a Pythagorean, and he is one of the most important\nsources for early Pythagoreanism. He wrote five works on\nPythagoreanism, although it is possible that some of these titles are\nalternative names for the same work: The Life of Pythagoras,\nOn Pythagoras and His Associates, On the Pythagorean\nLife, Pythagorean Precepts and a Life of\nArchytas. None of these works have survived intact, but portions\nof them were preserved by later authors (Wehrli 1945). Aristoxenus is\na valuable source because, as a member of the Lyceum, he is free of\nthe distorted image of Pythagoras propagated during his lifetime by\nPlato\u2019s successors in the Academy (see below, sect. 4.1) and\nbecause of his unique connections to Pythagoreanism. \n\nHe was born in Tarentum during the years when the most important\nPythagorean of the fourth century, Archytas, was the leading public\nfigure and his father, Spintharus, had connections to Archytas (Fr. 30\nWehrli). When Aristoxenus left Tarentum, as a young man, and\neventually came to Athens (ca. 350), his first teacher was the\nPythagorean, Xenophilus, before he went on to become the pupil of\nAristotle (Fr. 1 Wehrli). Some modern scholars are skeptical of\nAristoxenus\u2019 testimony, seeing his denial that there was a\nprohibition on eating beans and his assertion that Pythagoras was not\na vegetarian and particularly enjoyed eating young pigs and tender\nkids (Fr. 25 = Gellius IV 11), as attempts to make Pythagoreanism more\nrational than it was (Burkert 1972a, 107, 180). On the other hand, his\nLife of Archytas is not a simple panegyric; Archytas\u2019\nfoibles are recognized and his opponents are given a fair hearing. On\nAristoxenus as a source for Pythagoreanism see most recently Zhmud\n2012b and Huffman 2014b, 285\u2013295.\n\nPerhaps Aristoxenus\u2019 most interesting work on Pythagoreanism is\nthe Pythagorean Precepts, which is known primarily through\nsubstantial excerpts preserved by Stobaeus (Frs. 33\u201341 Wehrli).\nThis work does not mention any Pythagoreans by name but presents a set\nof ethical precepts that \u201cthey\u201d (i.e. the Pythagoreans)\nproposed concerning the various stages of human life, education, and\nthe proper place of sexuality and reproduction in human life. There\nare also analyses of concepts important in ethics, such as desire and\nluck. Given Aristoxenus\u2019 background, the Precepts would\nappear to be invaluable evidence for Pythagorean ethics in the first\nhalf of the fourth century, when Aristoxenus was studying\nPythagoreanism. They might be expected to partially embody the views\nof his teacher Xenophilus. The standard scholarly view of this work,\nhowever, is that Aristoxenus plundered Platonic and Aristotelian ideas\nfor the glory of the Pythagoreans (Wehrli 1945, 58 ff.; Burkert 1972a,\n107\u2013108; Zhmud 2012a, 65). There are serious difficulties with\nthe standard view, however (Huffman 2019). The analysis of luck that\nwas supposedly taken from Aristotle is, in fact, in sharp conflict\nwith Aristotle\u2019s view (Mills 1982) and appears to be one of the\nviews Aristotle was attacking. While the Precepts do have\nsimilarities to passages in Plato and Aristotle, they are at a very\nhigh level of generality and are shared with passages in other fifth\nand fourth century authors, such as Xenophon and Thucydides; it is the\ndistinctively Platonic and Aristotelian features that are missing.\n\nThe Precepts are thus best regarded as what they appear on\nthe surface to be, an account of Pythagorean ethics of the fourth\ncentury. This ethical system shows a similarity to a conservative\nstrain of Greek ethics, which is also found in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic, but has its own distinctive features (Huffman\n2019). The central outlook of the Precepts is a distrust of\nbasic human nature and an emphasis on the necessity for supervision of\nall aspects of human life (Fr. 35 Wehrli). The emphasis on order in\nlife is so marked that the status quo is preferred to what is\nright (Fr. 34). The Pythagoreans were particularly suspicious of\nbodily desire and analyzed the ways in which it could lead people\nastray (Fr. 37). There are strict limitations on sexual desire and the\npropagation of children (Fr. 39). Despite the best efforts of\nhumanity, however, many things are outside of human control, so the\nPythagoreans examined the impact of luck on human life (Fr. 41).\n\nAristoxenus is a source for the famous story of the two Pythagorean\nfriends Damon and Phintias, which was set during the tyranny of\nDionysius II in Syracuse (367\u2013357). As a test of their\nfriendship Dionysius falsely accused Phintias of plotting against him\nand sentenced him to death. Phintias asked time to set his affairs in\norder, and Dionysius was amazed when Damon took his place, while he\ndid so. Phintias showed his equal devotion to his friend by showing up\non time for his execution. Dionysius cancelled the execution and asked\nto become a partner in their friendship but was refused (Iamblichus,\nVP 234; Porphyry, VP 59\u201360; Diodorus X\n4.3).\n\nIn Diodorus\u2019 version, Phintias is presented as actually engaged\nin a plot against Dionysius and some argue that Aristoxenus\u2019\nversion is an attempt to whitewash the Pythagoreans (Riedweg 2005,\n40). On the other hand, Dionysius\u2019 eagerness to join in their\nfriendship, which occurs in both versions, is harder to understand if\nthere really had been a plot (see Burkert 1972a, 104). There are two\nother considerations. First, Aristoxenus cites Dionysius II himself as\nhis source, whereas it is unclear what source Diodorus used. Second,\nit is far from clear that Aristoxenus would object to the Pythagoreans\nplotting against a tyrant. Thus, there are good reasons for regarding\nAristoxenus\u2019 version as more accurate.\n\nCleinias and Prorus are another pair of Pythagorean friends, whose\nstory may have been told by Aristoxenus (Iamblichus, VP 127),\nalthough they were not friends in the usual sense. Cleinias, who was\nfrom Tarentum, knew nothing of Prorus of Cyrene other than that he was\na Pythagorean, who had lost his fortune in political turmoil. On these\ngrounds alone he went to Cyrene, taking the money to restore\nProrus\u2019 fortunes (Iamblichus, VP 239; Diodorus X 4.1).\nNothing else is known of Prorus, although some pseudepigrapha were\nforged in his name (Thesleff 1965, 154.13). It appears that Cleinias\nwas a contemporary of Plato, since Aristoxenus reports that he and an\notherwise unknown Pythagorean, Amyclas, persuaded Plato not to burn\nthe books of Democritus, on the grounds that it would do no good,\nsince they were already widely known (Diogenes Laertius IX 40).\nCleinias was involved in several other anecdotes. Like Archytas he\nsupposedly refused to punish when angry (VP 198) and, when\nangered, calmed himself by playing the lyre (Athenaeus XIV 624a).\nAsked when one should resort to a woman he said \u201cwhen one\nhappens to want especially to be harmed\u201d (Plutarch,\nMoralia 654b). Several pseudepigrapha appear in\nCleinias\u2019 name as well.\n\nMyllias of Croton and his wife Timycha appear in Iamblichus\u2019\ncatalogue and are known from a famous anecdote of uncertain origin,\nwhich is preserved by Iamblichus (VP 189 ff.). They were\npersecuted by the tyrant Dionysius II of Syracuse, but Timycha showed\nher loyalty and courage by biting off her tongue and spitting it in\nthe tyrant\u2019s face, rather than risk divulging Pythagorean\nsecrets under torture.\n\nNone of the Pythagoreans mentioned in the previous four paragraphs\nappear to have to have anything to do with the sciences or natural\nphilosophy. Since their Pythagoreanism consists exclusively in their\nway of life, they are best regarded as examples of the\nacusmatici. Many scholars have regarded Diodorus of Aspendus\nin Pamphylia (southern Asia Minor), as an important example of what\nthe Pythagorean acusmatici were like in the first half of the\nfourth century (Burkert 1972a, 202\u2013204). Diodorus is primarily\nknown through a group of citations preserved by Athenaeus (IV 163c-f),\nwhich describe him as a vegetarian who was outfitted in an outlandish\nway, some features of which later became characteristic of the Cynics,\ne.g., long hair, long beard, a shabby cloak, a staff and\nbeggar\u2019s rucksack (cf. Diogenes Laertius VI 13). The historian\nTimaeus (350\u2013260), however, casts doubt on Diodorus\u2019\ncredentials as a Pythagorean saying that \u201che pretended to have\nassociated with the Pythagoreans\u201d and Sosicrates, another\nhistorian (2nd century BCE; fragments in Jacoby) says that his\noutlandish dress was his own innovation, since before this\nPythagoreans had always worn white clothing, bathed and wore their\nhair according to fashion (Athenaeus IV 163e ff.). Iamblichus, the\nother major source for Diodorus outside Athenaeus, also treats\nDiodorus with reserve, saying that he was accepted by the leader of\nthe Pythagorean school at the time, one Aresas, because there were so\nfew members of the school. He continues, perhaps again with\ndisapproval, to report that Diodorus returned to Greece and spread\nabroad the Pythagorean oral teachings.\n\nThese sources clearly suggest that Diodorus was anything but a typical\nPythagorean, even of the acusmatic variety. Burkert has\nargued that this reflects a bias of sources such as Aristoxenus, who\nwanted to make Pythagoreanism appear reasonable and emphasized the\nversion of Pythagoreanism practiced by the math\u00eamatici\nrather than the acusmatici. In support of this conclusion, he\nargues that the two earliest sources present Diodorus as a Pythagorean\nwithout any qualifications (1972a, 204). It is important to look\ncarefully at those sources, however. First, neither is a philosopher\nor a historian, who might be expected to give a careful presentation\nof Diodorus. The oldest is a lyre player named Stratonicus (died 350\nBCE), who was famous for his witticisms, and the other, Archestratus\n(fl. 330 BCE), wrote a book entitled The Life of Luxury,\nwhich focused on culinary delights. Such sources might be expected to\naccept typical stories that went around about Diodorus without any\nclose analysis.\n\nIn the case of our earliest source, Stratonicus, there is, moreover,\nonce again evidence suggesting that Diodorus was not regarded as a\ntypical Pythagorean. In describing Diodorus\u2019 relationship to\nPythagoras, Stratonicus does not use a typical word for student or\ndisciple, but rather the same word (pelat\u00eas) that Plato\nused in the Euthyphro to describe the day-laborer who died at\nthe hands of Euthyphro\u2019s father. Diodorus is thus being\npresented sarcastically as a hired hand in the Pythagorean tradition,\nwhich is very much in accord with the later presentations of him as a\npoor man\u2019s Pythagoras on the fringes of Pythagoreanism. Thus,\nrather than accusing the sources of bias against Diodorus, it seems\nbetter to accept their almost universal testimony that he was not a\ntypical acusmatic but rather a marginal figure, who used\nPythagoreanism in part to try to gain respectability for his own\neccentric lifestyle.\n\nIndividuals known as \u201cPythagorists,\u201d i.e. Pythagorizers,\nare ridiculed by writers of Greek comedy, such as Alexis, Antiphanes,\nAristophon, and Cratinus the younger, in the middle and second half of\nthe fourth century (see Burkert 1972a, 198, n. 25 for the evidence and\n200, n. 41 for the dating). The most important of the fragments of\nthese comedies that deal with the Pythagorists are collected by\nAthenaeus (IV 160f ff) and Diogenes Laertius (VIII 37\u201338). The\nterm \u201cPythagorist\u201d is usually negative in the comic\nwriters (Arnott 1996, 581\u2013582) and picks out people who share\nsome of the same extreme ascetic lifestyle as Diodorus. A fragment of\nAntiphanes describes someone as eating \u201cnothing animate, as if\nPythagorizing\u201d (Fr. 133 Kassel and Austin = Athenaeus IV 161a).\nIn The Pythagorizing Woman, Alexis presents the vegetarian\nsacrificial feast that is customary for the Pythagoreans as including\ndried figs, cheese and olive cakes, and reports that the Pythagorean\nlife entailed \u201cscanty food, filth, cold, silence, sullenness,\nand no baths\u201d as well as drinking water instead of wine (Frs.\n201\u2013202 = Athenaeus IV 161c and III 122f).\n\nA number of these characteristics can be connected to the\nacusmata (Arnott 1996, 583), e.g., the lack of bathing may be\na joke based on the acusma that forbids the Pythagoreans from\nusing the public baths (Iamblichus, VP 83), Antiphanes (fr.\n158) satirizes the acusmata\u2019s bizarre list of foods\nthat can be eaten (D.L. 8.19) by describing his Pythagoreans as\nsearching for sea orach, and the silence or sullenness ascribed to the\nPythagoreans in comedy accords not just with the acusmata but\nwith early testimony about the Pythagoreans in Isocrates\n(Busiris 29) and Dicaearchus (Fr. 40 Mirhady). A fragment of\nAristophon\u2019s Pythagorist suggests that this ascetic\nlife was based on poverty rather than philosophical scruple and that,\nif you put meat and fish in front of these Pythagorists, they would\ngobble them down (Fr. 9 = Athenaeus IV 161e). In a fragment of Alexis,\nafter the speaker reports that the Pythagoreans eat nothing animate,\nhe is interrupted by someone who objects that \u201cEpicharides eats\ndogs, and he is a Pythagorean,\u201d to which the response is,\n\u201cyes, but he kills them first and so they are not still\nanimate\u201d (Fr. 223 + Athenaeus 161b). Epicharides and some other\nnamed figures may well be Athenians who are satirized by being\nassigned a Pythagorean life (Athenaeus 2006, 272). Another fragment of\nAristophon\u2019s Pythagorist reports that the Pythagoreans\nhave a far different existence in the underworld than others, in that\nthey feast with Hades because of their piety, but this just occasions\nthe remark that Hades is an unpleasant god to enjoy the company of\nsuch filthy wretches (Fr. 12 = Diogenes Laertius VIII 38).\n\nBoth Alexis (Fr. 223 = Athenaeus IV 161b) and Cratinus the younger\n(Fr. 7 = Diogenes Laertius VIII 37) wrote plays entitled The\nPeople of Tarentum, which, although they may not have been\nprimarily about Pythagoreans, featured depictions of them (Arnott\n1996, 625\u2013626). In this case, the Pythagoreans are again\nsatirized for their simple diet, bread and water (which is called\n\u201cprison fare\u201d), and for drinking no wine. In these plays,\nhowever, the Pythagoreans are also presented as feeding on\n\u201csubtle arguments\u201d and \u201cfinely honed thoughts\u201d\nand as pestering others with them, in a way that is reminiscent of\nAristophanes\u2019 treatment of Socrates in the Clouds.\n\nGiven the fragmentary nature of the evidence, it is unclear whether\nthese ascetic Pythagoreans who engage in argument are the same as the\nPythagorists in the other comedies, who are characterized by their\nfilth and eccentric appearance. Certainly the latter are more\nreminiscent of Diodorus of Aspendus, while the former might be closer\nto what we know of someone like Cleinias. In the first half of the\nthird century, the poet Theocritus still preserves a memory of these\nPythagorists as \u201cpale and without shoes\u201d (XIV 5). The\nscholiast to the passage testifies to the continuing controversy about\nthe Pythagorists by drawing a distinction between Pythagoreans who\ngive every attention to their body and Pythagorists who are filthy\n(although another scholion reports that others say the opposite, see\nArnott 1996, 581). A passage in Iamblichus (VP 80) similarly\nargues that the Pythagoreans were the true followers of Pythagoras,\nwhile the Pythagorists just emulated them.\n\nIn recent scholarship, the tendency has been to regard Diodorus and\nthe Pythagorists as legitimate Pythagoreans of the acusmatic stamp,\nwhose eccentricities are perhaps a little exaggerated in comedy. The\nextensive evidence from antiquity which argues that they were not true\nPythagoreans is interpreted as bias on the part of conservative\nPythagoreans of the hyper-math\u00eamatici sort, such as\nAristoxenus, who wanted to disassociate themselves and Pythagoreanism\nin general from such strange people. This is a possible interpretation\nof the evidence, but, as the evidence for Diodorus shows, it is also\nquite possible that Diodorus and the more extreme Pythagorists\ndepicted in comedy were in fact people with whom few Pythagoreans\neither of the math\u00eamatici or the acusmatici\nwanted to associate themselves. Many religious movements have a\nradical fringe, and there is little reason to think that\nPythagoreanism should differ in this regard. In connection with his\nthesis that the  acusmata were a literary phenomenon and that\nno one lived a life in accordance with them Zhmud argues that the\nPythagorists of comedy are a creation of the comic stage and do not\nprovide evidence for Pythagoreans living a life governed by\nacusmata (Zhmud 2012a, 175\u2013183). It is true that many\nof the features of the Pythagorists are shared with Socrates as\npresented in the Clouds (subtle arguments, plain food, filthy\nclothes). Zhmud suggests that vegetarianism was added to this stock\npicture of the philosopher to give a Pythagorean color and that this\nvegetarianism was derived solely from the eccentric figure of Diodorus\nof Aspendus. However, as noted above there are more connections to the\nacusmata than just vegetarianism and it is hard to believe\nthat the repeated jokes at the expense of those living a Pythagorean\nlife had no correlate in reality other than Diodorus. \n\nPerhaps the best way to evaluate the complicated evidence for\nfourth-century Pythagoreanism is to conclude that there were three\nmain groups, each of which admitted some variation. There were\nmath\u00eamatici such as Archytas who did serious research\nin the mathematical disciplines and natural philosophy but who also\nlived an ascetic life that emphasized self-control and avoidance of\nbodily pleasure. Other Pythagoreans such as Cleinias or Xenophilus may\nhave done no work in the sciences but lived a Pythagorean life, which\nwas similar to that of Archytas and followed principles similar to\nthose set out in Aristoxenus\u2019 Pythagorean Precepts.\nThey may have observed some mild dietary restrictions and may be\nsimilar to the figures satirized in The Men of Tarentum as\neating a simple diet but still engaged in subtle arguments. There was\nprobably a continuum of people in this category with some following\nmore or different sets of the acusmata than others. Finally\nthere are the Pythagorean hippies such as Diodorus and the\nPythagorists, who ostentatiously live a life in accord with some of\nthe acusmata, but who take such an extreme interpretation of\nthem as to be regarded as eccentrics by most Pythagoreans.\n\nDiogenes Laertius reports, evidently on the authority of Aristoxenus,\nthat the last Pythagoreans were Xenophilus from the Thracian\nChalcidice (Aristoxenus\u2019 teacher), and four Pythagoreans from\nPhlius: Phanton, Echecrates, Diocles and Polymnastus. These\nPythagoreans are further identified as the pupils of Philolaus and\nEurytus. Little more is known of Xenophilus beyond his living for more\nthan 105 years (DK I 442\u2013443). The Pythagoreans from Phlius are\njust names except Echecrates (DK I 443), to whom Phaedo narrates,\nevidently in Phlius, the events of Socrates\u2019 last day in\nPlato\u2019s Phaedo. Socrates\u2019 interlocutors in the\nPhaedo, Simmias and Cebes, are often regarded as\nPythagoreans, because they are said to have been pupils of Philolaus\nwhen he was in Thebes. They are also shown to be pupils of Socrates,\nhowever, and it is unclear that their connection to Philolaus was any\ncloser than their connection to Socrates. They are not listed in\nIamblichus\u2019 catalogue as Pythagoreans; Diogenes Laertius\nincludes them with other followers of Socrates (II 124\u2013125).\nEchecrates might have been born around 420 and thus be a young man at\nthe dramatic date of the Phaedo. Aristoxenus\u2019 assertion\nthat these were the last of the Pythagoreans would then suggest that\nPythagoreanism died out around 350, when Echecrates was an old\nman.\n\nRiedweg says that this claim is \u201cdemonstrably untrue\u201d\npointing to a Pythagorean, Lycon, who criticized Aristotle\u2019s\nsupposed extravagant way of life and to the Pythagorists discussed\nabove (2005, 106). This seems slender evidence upon which to be so\ncritical of Aristoxenus. Virtually nothing is known of Lycon, and\nAristocles (1st-2nd c. CE), who recounts the criticism of Aristotle,\nsays that Lycon \u201ccalled himself a Pythagorean,\u201d thus\nexpressing some sort of reservation about his credentials (DK I\n445\u2013446). Aristoxenus\u2019 assertion is probably to be\nunderstood as a general claim that, with the deaths of the\nPythagoreans from Phlius around the middle of the fourth century,\nPythagoreanism as an active movement was dead. This would be\ncompatible with a few individuals still claiming to be Pythagoreans\nafter 350.\n\nThis is not inconsistent with the existence of a few isolated\nindividuals, who still claim to be Pythagoreans. Certainly, from the\nevidence available to modern scholars, Aristoxenus\u2019 claim is\nlargely true. From about 350 BCE until about 100 BCE, there is a\nradical drop in evidence for individuals who call themselves\nPythagoreans. Iamblichus (In Nic. 116.1\u20137) appears to\ndate the Pythagoreans Myonides and Euphranor, who worked on the\nmathematics of means, after the time of Eratosthenes (285\u2013194\nBCE) and hence to the second century BCE or later (Burkert 1972a,\n442), but Iamblichus\u2019 history of the means is very confused and\nthey might belong to the rise of Neopythagoreanism in the first\ncenturies BCE and CE. Kahn (2001, 83) sees a hint of Pythagorean cult\nactivity in the spurious Pythagorean Memoirs, which must date\nsometime before the first half of the first century BCE, when they are\nquoted by Alexander Polyhistor (see section 4.2 below). A few other\nPythagorean pseudepigrapha appear in the period (see further below,\nsect. 4.2), although it is unclear what sort of Pythagorean community,\nif any, was associated with them. Pythagoreanism is not completely\ndead between 350 and 100 (see further below, sect. 3.5), but few\nindividual Pythagoreans or organized groups of Pythagoreans can be\nidentified in this period.\n3.6 Timaeus, Ocellus, Hicetas and Ecphantus\n\nThe names Timaeus of Locri and Ocellus of Lucania are famous as the\nauthors of the two most influential Pythagorean pseudepigrapha (see\nbelow, sect. 4.2). In his catalogue of Pythagoreans, Iamblichus lists\nan Ocellus under Lucania and two men named Timaeus, neither under\nLocri. The later forgery of works attributed to Timaeus and Ocellus\ndoes not of course mean that Pythagoreans of these names did not\nexist, and it is possible that the Timaeus of Locri who is the main\nspeaker in Plato\u2019s Timaeus was an historical Timaeus\n(some have thought Plato uses him as a mask for Archytas, however). If\nthey really did exist, however, nothing is known about them, since all\nother reports in the ancient tradition are likely to be based on\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus or the spurious works in their\nname.\n\nSome scholars have argued that Hicetas and Ecphantus, both of\nSyracuse, were not historical figures at all but rather characters in\ndialogues written by Heraclides of Pontus, a fourth-century member of\nthe Academy. By a misunderstanding, they came to be treated as\nhistorical Pythagoreans in the doxographical tradition (see Guthrie\n1962, 323 ff. for references). This theory arose because both Hicetas\nand Ecphantus are said to have made the earth rotate on its axis,\nwhile the heavens remained fixed, in order to explain astronomical\nphenomena, and, in one report, Heraclides is paired with Ecphantus as\nhaving adopted this view (Aetius III 13.3 =DK I 442.23). In addition\nEcphantus is assigned a form of atomism (DK I 442.7 ff.) similar to\nthat assigned to Heraclides (Fr. 118\u2013121 Wehrli). It is not\nuncommon in the doxographical tradition for a report of the form\n\u201cx and y believe z\u201d to mean that \u201cy, as reported by\nx, believes z,\u201d so it is suggested that in this case\n\u201cHeraclides and Ecphantus\u201d means \u201cEcphantus as\npresented by Heraclides.\u201d There is a serious problem with this\ningenious theory. The doxographical reports about Hicetas and\nEcphantus ultimately rely on Theophrastus (Cicero mentions\nTheophrastus by name at DK I 441.27), and it is implausible that\nTheophrastus would treat characters invented by his older\ncontemporary, Heraclides, as historical figures. Theophrastus did\naccept the Academic glorification of Pythagoras (see on\nNeopythagoreanism below, sect. 4.1), but this provides no grounds for\nsupposing that he accepted a character in a dialogue as a historical\nperson (pace Burkert 1972a, 341).\n\nThe testimonia for Hicetas are meager and contradictory (DK I\n441\u2013442). He appears to have argued that the celestial phenomena\nare best explained by assuming that all heavenly bodies are stationary\nand that the apparent movement of the stars and planets is the result\nof the earth\u2019s rotation around its own axis. He may also have\nfollowed Philolaus in positing a counter-earth, opposite the earth on\nthe other side of a central fire, although, if he did, it is unclear\nhow he would have explained why it and the central fire are not\nvisible from the rotating earth. In Philolaus\u2019 system the\ncentral fire remains invisible because the earth orbits the central\nfire as it rotates on its axis, thus keeping one side of the earth\nalways turned away from the central fire. A little more is known about\nEcphantus (DK I 442). He too is said to have believed that the earth\nmoved, not by changing its location (as Philolaus proposed, in making\nthe earth and counter-earth revolve around the central fire: see\nSection 4.2 of the entry on\n Philolaus),\n but by rotating on its axis.\n\nCopernicus was inspired by these testimonia about Hicetas and\nEcphantus, as well as those about Philolaus, to consider the motion of\nthe earth (see below, sect. 5.2). Ecphantus developed his own original\nform of atomism. He is best understood as reacting to and developing\nthe views of Democritus. He agreed with Democritus 1) \u201cthat\nhuman beings do not grasp true knowledge of the things that are, but\ndefine them as they believe them to be\u201d (DK I 442.7\u20138; cf.\nDemocritus Frs. 6\u201310) and 2) that all sensible things arise from\nindivisible first bodies and void. He differs from Democritus,\nhowever, in supposing that atoms are limited rather than unlimited in\nnumber and that there is just one cosmos rather than many. As in\nDemocritus, atoms differ in shape and size, but Ecphantus adds power\n(dynamis) as a third distinguishing factor. He explains\natomic motion not just in terms of weight and external blows, as the\natomists did, but also by a divine power, which he called mind or\nsoul, so that \u201cthe cosmos was composed of atoms but organized by\nprovidence\u201d (DK I 442.21\u201322). It is because of this divine\npower that the cosmos is spherical in shape. This unique spherical\ncosmos is reminiscent of Plato\u2019s Timaeus, but the rest\nof Ecphantus\u2019 system differs enough from Plato that there is no\nquestion of its being a forgery based on the Timaeus. One\ntestimony says that he was the first to make Pythagorean monads\ncorporeal, thus differing from the fifth-century Pythagoreans\ndescribed by Aristotle, who do not seem to have addressed the question\nof whether numbers were physical entities or not.\n\nIt is difficult to be sure of the date of either Hicetas or Ecphantus.\nSince, however, both seem to be influenced by Philolaus\u2019 idea of\na moving earth and since Ecphantus appears to be developing the\natomism of Democritus, it is usually assumed that they belong to the\nfirst half of the fourth century (Guthrie 1962, 325\u2013329; Zhmud\n2012a, 130). Hicetas does not appear in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue.\nThere is an Ecphantus in the catalogue, but he is listed under Croton\nrather than Syracuse, so it cannot be certain whether he is the\nEcphantus described in the doxography.\n3.7 Plato and Pythagoreanism\n\nThere is currently a very wide range of opinions about the\nrelationship of Plato to Pythagoreanism. Many scholars both ancient\nand modern have thought that Plato was very closely tied to\nPythagoreanism. In the biography of Pythagoras read by Photius in the\n9th century CE (Bibl. 249) Plato is presented as a member of\nthe Pythagorean school. He is the pupil of Archytas and the ninth\nsuccessor to Pythagoras himself. If this were true then Plato would\ncertainly be the most illustrious early Pythagorean after Pythagoras\nhimself. Some modern scholars, while not going this far, have seen the\nconnections between Plato and the Pythagoreans to be very close\nindeed. Thus, A. E. Taylor in his great commentary on the\nTimaeus says that his main thesis is that \u201cthe teaching\nof Timaeus [in Plato\u2019s Timaeus] can be shown to be in\ndetail exactly what we should expect from an fifth-century Italian\nPythagorean\u201d (1928, 11). Guthrie in his famous history of\nancient philosophy commented that Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy\nwere so close that it is difficult to separate them (1975, 35).\nRecently it has been argued that Plato was so steeped in\nPythagoreanism that he structured his dialogues by counting numbers of\nlines and placing important passages at points in the dialogue that\ncorrespond to important ratios in Pythagorean harmonic theory\n(Kennedy, 2010 and 2011). Thus, the vision of the form of beauty\nappears 3/4 of the way through the Symposium by line count\nand the ratio 3 : 4 corresponds to the central musical interval of the\nfourth. There are, however, serious questions about the methodology\nused (Gregory 2012) and it is a serious problem both that no one in\nthe ancient world reports that Plato used such a practice and that the\nmiddle of the dialogue, which corresponds to the most concordant\nmusical interval, the octave (2:1), does not usually contain the most\nphilosophically important content. Another approach sees Plato as\nengaged with and heavily influenced by Pythagorean ideas in passages\nwhere the Pythagoreans are not specifically mentioned in dialogues\nsuch as the Cratylus (401b11-d7) and Phaedo\n(101b10\u2013104c9) (Horky 2013). The problem is that in contrast to\nthe Philebus, where the connection to Philolaus is clear (see\nbelow), the connections to the Pythagoreans in these passages are too\nindirect or general (e.g., the concepts odd and even and the number 3\nin the Phaedo passage are not unique to the Pythagoreans) to\nbe very convincing and partly depend on the doubtful assumption that\nEpicharmus was a Pythagorean (see section 3.4 above). The central text\nfor many of those who see Plato as closely tied to Pythagoreanism is\nAristotle\u2019s comment in Metaphysics 1.6 that Plato\n\u201cfollowed these men (i.e. the Pythagoreans according to these\nscholars) in most respects\u201d (987a29\u201331). In contrast to\nthese attempts to connect Plato closely to Pythagoreanism, most recent\nPlatonic scholars seem to think Pythagoreanism of little importance\nfor Plato. Thus two prominent handbooks to Plato\u2019s thought\n(Kraut 1992; Benson 2006) and another book of essays devoted\nspecifically to the Timaeus, (Mohr and Sattler 2010) hardly\nmention the Pythagoreans at all. \n\nIn recent studies of the topic that lie somewhere between these\nextremes, one approach is to argue that there is clear Pythagorean\ninfluence on Plato but that its scope is much more limited than often\nassumed (Huffman 2013). Plato explicitly mentions Pythagoras and the\nPythagoreans only one time each in the dialogues and this provides\nprima facie evidence that Pythagorean influence was not\nextensive. Moreover, at Metaphysics 987a29\u201331 the\n\u201cthese men\u201d that Aristole says Plato follows in most\nrespects may not be the Pythagoreans but the Presocratics in general.\nAristotle\u2019s presentation as a whole mainly attests to\nPythagorean influence only on Plato\u2019s late theory of principles.\nIt is often assumed that Plato owes his mathematical conception of the\ncosmos and his belief in the immortality and transmigration of the\nsoul to Pythagoreanism (Kahn 2001, 3\u20134). However, the role of\nPythagoreanism in Greek mathematics has been overstated and while\nPlato had contacts with mathematicians who were Pythagoreans like\nArchytas, the most prominent mathematicians in the dialogues,\nTheodorus and Theaetetus, are not Pythagoreans. It is thus a serious\nmistake to assume that any mention of mathematics in Plato suggests\nPythagorean influence. The same is true of the immortality and\ntransmigration of the soul in Plato, which are often assumed to be\nderived from Pythagoreanism. Some have also thought that Platonic\nmyths and especially the myth at the end of the Phaedo draw\nheavily on Pythagoreanism (Kingsley 1995, 79\u2013171). However, most\nof the contexts in which Plato mentions the immortality of the soul\nincluding the Platonic myths, suggest that he is thinking of mystery\ncults and the Orphics rather than the Pythagoreans (Huffman 2013,\n243\u2013254). On the other hand, in the Philebus (16c-17a)\nPlato gives clear acknowledgement of the debt he owes to men before\nhis time who posit limit and unlimited as basic principles. The\nfragments of Philolaus and Aristotle\u2019s reports on Pythagoreanism\nmake clear that this is a reference to Philolaus and the Pythagoreans.\nThe principles of limit and unlimited are clearly connected to\nPlato\u2019s one and indefinite dyad and it is precisely these\nprinciples of Plato that Aristotle connects most closely to\nPythagoreanism (Metaph. 987b25\u201332). Thus Plato\u2019s\nevidence coheres with Aristotle\u2019s to suggest that Pythagoreanism\nexerted considerable influence on Plato\u2019s late theory of\nprinciples. It is also true that specific aspects of Plato\u2019s\nmathematical view of the world are owed to the Pythagoreans, e.g., the\nworld soul in the Timaeus is constructed according to the\ndiatonic scale that is prominent in Philolaus (Fr. 6a). However, most\nof the Timaeus is not derived from Pythagoreanism and some of\nit in fact conflicits with Pythagoreanism (e.g., Archytas famously\nargued that the universe was unlimited while Plato\u2019s in\nlimited). The same is true for Plato as a whole. Isolated ideas such\nas the one and the dyad and the structure of the world soul show heavy\nPythagorean influence, but there is no evidence that Pythagoreanism\nplayed a central role in the development of the core of Plato\u2019s\nphilosophy (e.g., the theory of forms).\n\nA second approach is to argue that, while it is true that not all\nmentions of mathematics or all mentions of the transmigration of the\nsoul derive from Pythagoreanism, nonetheless a central system of value\nthat appears early in Plato\u2019s work and persists to the end is\nderived from Pythagoreanism (Palmer 2014). Already in the\nGorgias Plato argues that principles of order and correctness\nwhich are found in the cosmos and explain its goodness also govern\nhuman relations. Socrates here puts forth a much more definite\nconception of the good than in earlier dialogues. His complaint that\nCallicles pays no attention to the role played by orderliness and\nself-control and neglects geometrical equality (507e6\u2013508a8)\nmirrors the emphasis on organization and calculation in contemporary\nPythagorean texts such as Archytas Fr. 3 and Aristoxenus\u2019\nPythagorean Precepts Fr. 35. It thus appears that\n\u201cSocrates\u2019\u201d new insight into the good in\nGorgias derives from Plato\u2019s contact with the\nPythagoreans after the death of the historical Socrates. Plato never\nabandons this Pythagorean conception of value and it can be traced\nthrough the Phaedo and Republic to late dialogues\nsuch as the Timaeus, where the cosmos is embued with\nprinciples of mathematical order, and Philebus, where the\nhighest value is assigned to measure (66a). The question is whether\nthis emphasis on measure and order is uniquely Pythagorean in\norigin.\n4. Neopythagoreanism\n\nNeopythagoreanism is characterized by the tendency to see Pythagoras\nas the central and original figure in the development of Greek\nphilosophy, to whom, according to some authors (e.g. Iamblichus,\nVP 1), a divine revelation had been given. This revelation\nwas often seen as having close affinities to the wisdom of earlier\nnon-Greeks such as the Hebrews, the Magi and the Egyptians. Because of\nthe belief in the centrality of the philosophy of Pythagoras, later\nphilosophy was regarded as simply an elaboration of the revelation\nexpounded by Pythagoras; it thus became the fashion to father the\nviews of later philosophers, particularly Plato, back onto Pythagoras.\nNeopythagoreans typically emphasize the role of number in the cosmos\nand treat the One and Indefinite Dyad as ultimate principles going\nback to Pythagoras, although these principles in fact originate with\nPlato. The origins of Neopythagoreanism are probably to be found\nalready in Plato\u2019s school, the Academy, in the second half of\nthe fourth century BCE. There is evidence that Plato\u2019s\nsuccessors, Speusippus and Xenocrates, both presented Academic\nspeculations arising in part from Plato\u2019s later metaphysics as\nthe work of Pythagoras, who lived some 150 years earlier. After a\ndecline in interest in Pythagoreanism for a couple of centuries,\nNeopythagoreanism emerged again and developed further starting in the\nfirst century BCE and extending throughout the rest of antiquity and\ninto the middle ages and Renaissance. During this entire period, it is\nthe Neopythagorean construct of Pythagoras that dominates, a construct\nthat has only limited contact with early Pythagoreanism; there is\nlittle interest in an historically accurate presentation of Pythagoras\nand his philosophy. In reading the following account of\nNeopythagoreanism, it may be helpful to refer to the\n Chronological Chart of Sources for Pythagoras,\n in the entry on Pythagoras.\n4.1 Origins in the Early Academy: Speusippus, Xenocrates and Heraclides in Contrast to Aristotle and the Peripatetics\n\nThe evidence for Speusippus, Plato\u2019s successor as head of the\nAcademy, is fragmentary and second hand, so that certainty in\ninterpretation is hardly possible. In one passage, however, he assigns\nnot just Plato\u2019s principles, the one and the dyad, to \u201cthe\nancients,\u201d who in context seem likely to be the Pythagoreans,\nbut also a development of the Platonic system according to which the\none was regarded as beyond being (Fr. 48 Taran; see Burkert 1972a,\n63\u201364; Dillon 2003, 56\u201357). Some scholars reject this\nwidely held view on the grounds that this fragment of Speusippus is\nspurious (Zhmud 2012a, 424\u2014425, who cites other scholars; Taran\n1981, 350ff.; for a response see Dillon 2014, 251) and if this were\ntrue it would seriously weaken the case for supposing that\nNeopythagoreanism began already in the Academy. Speusippus also wrote\na book On Pythagorean Numbers (Fr. 28 Taran), which builds on\nideas attested for the early Pythagoreans (e.g., ten as the perfect\nnumber, although Zhmud regards the perfection of ten as a Platonic\nrather than a Pythagorean doctrine 2012a, 404\u201309). We cannot be\nsure, however, either that the title goes back to Speusippus or that\nhe assigned all ideas in it to the Pythagoreans. Aristotle twice cites\nagreement between Speusippus and the Pythagoreans (Metaph.\n1072b30 ff.; EN 1096b5\u20138), which might suggest that\nSpeusippus himself had identified the Pythagoreans as his predecessors\nin these areas. Speusippus and Xenocrates denied that the creation of\nthe universe in Plato\u2019s Timaeus should be understood\nliterally; when the view that the cosmos was only created in thought\nand not in time is assigned to Pythagoras in the later doxography\n(A\u00ebtius II 4.1 \u2014 Diels 1958, 330), it certainly looks as if\nan idea which had its origin in the interpretation of Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus in the Academy is being assigned back to Pythagoras\n(Burkert 1972a, 71). The evidence is not sufficient to conclude that\nSpeusippus routinely assigned Platonic and Academic ideas to the\nPythagoreans (Taran 1981, 109), but there is enough evidence to\nsuggest that he did so in some cases.\n\nSpeusippus\u2019 successor as head of the Academy, Xenocrates, may\nactually have followed some version of the Pythagorean way of life,\ne.g., he was apparently a vegetarian, refused to give oaths, was\nprotective of animals and followed a highly structured daily regimen,\nsetting aside time for silence (Dillon 2003, 94\u201395 and 2014,\n254\u2013257; Burkert, however, argues that he rejected\nmetempsychosis [1972a, 124]). He wrote a book entitled Things\nPythagorean, the contents of which are unfortunately unknown\n(Diogenes Laertius IV 13). In the extant fragments of his writings, he\nrefers to Pythagoras by name once, reporting that \u201che discovered\nthat the musical intervals too did not arise apart from number\u201d\n(Fr. 9 Heinze). Several doctrines of Xenocrates are also assigned to\nPythagoras in the doxographical tradition, e.g., the definition of the\nsoul as \u201ca number moving itself,\u201d which Xenocrates clearly\ndeveloped on the basis of Plato\u2019s Timaeus (Plutarch,\nOn the Generation of the Soul 1012d; A\u00ebtius IV\n2.3\u20134). This suggests that Xenocrates, like Speusippus, may have\nassigned his own teachings back to Pythagoras or at least treated\nPythagoras as his precursor in such as way that it was easy for others\nto do so (Burkert 1972a, 64\u201365; Dillon 2003, 153\u2013154;\nZhmud [2012a, 55 and 426\u2013427] disputes this interpretation).\n\nYet another member of the early Academy, Heraclides of Pontus\n(Gottschalk 1980), in a series of influential dialogues, further\ndeveloped the presentation of Pythagoras as the founder of philosophy.\nIn the dialogue, On the Woman Who Stopped Breathing,\nPythagoras is presented as the inventor of the word\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d (Frs. 87\u201388 Wehrli = Diogenes Laertius\nProem 12 and Cicero, Tusc. V 3.8). Although some scholars\nhave tried to find a kernel of truth in the story (e.g., Riedweg 2005,\n90 ff., for a response see Huffman 2008b), its definition of the\nphilosopher as one who seeks wisdom rather than possessing it is\nregarded by many scholars as a Socratic/Platonic formulation, which\nHeraclides, in his dialogue, is assigning to Pythagoras as part of a\nliterary fiction (Burkert 1960 and 1972a, 65). Heraclides also assigns\nto Pythagoras a definition of happiness as \u201cthe knowledge of the\nperfection of the numbers of the soul\u201d (Fr. 44 Wehrli), in which\nagain the Platonic account of the numerical structure of the soul in\nthe Timaeus appears to be fathered on Pythagoras. Other\nfragments show Heraclides\u2019 further fascination with the\nPythagoreans. He developed what would become one of the canonical\naccounts of Pythagoras\u2019 previous incarnations (Fr. 89 Wehrli).\nPerhaps on the basis of the Pythagorean Philolaus\u2019 astronomical\nsystem, he developed the astronomical theory, later to be championed\nby Copernicus, according to which the apparent daily motion of the sun\nand stars was to be explained by the rotation of the earth (Frs.\n104\u2013108; see on Hicetas and Ecphantus above, sect. 3.6). For a\ndifferent view of Heraclides\u2019 relation to the Pythagoreans see\nZhmud 2012a, 427\u2013432.\n\nIn contrast to the fascination with and glorification of Pythagoras in\nthe Academy after Plato\u2019s death, Aristotle did not treat\nPythagoras as part of the philosophical tradition at all. In the\nsurveys of his predecessors in his extant works, Aristotle does not\ninclude Pythagoras himself and he evidently presented him in his lost\nspecial treatises on the Pythagoreans only as a wonder-worker and\nfounder of a way of life. While Aristotle did acknowledge close\nconnections between Plato\u2019s late theory of principles (One and\nIndefinite Dyad) and fifth-century Pythagoreans, he also sharply\ndistinguished Plato from the Pythagoreans on a series of important\npoints (Metaph. 987b23 ff.), perhaps in response to the\nAcademy\u2019s tendency to assign Platonic doctrines to Pythagoras.\nAristotle\u2019s students Eudemus, in his histories of arithmetic,\ngeometry and astronomy and Meno, in his history of medicine, follow\nAristotle\u2019s practice of not mentioning Pythagoras himself,\nreferring to individual Pythagoreans such as Philolaus or to the\nPythagoreans as a group. Eudemus assigns the Pythagoreans a number of\nimportant contributions to the sciences but does not give them the\ndecisive or foundational role found in the Neopythagorean tradition.\nAristotle\u2019s pupils Dicaearchus (Porphyry, VP 19) and\nAristoxenus do mention Pythagoras but this is because they are\nfocusing on the the Pythagorean way of life and the history of the\nPythagorean communities. Neither assign to Pythagoras or the\nPythagoreans the characteristics of Neopythagoreanism. Aristoxenus is\none of the most important and extensive sources for Pythagoreanism\n(see 3.5 above). He presents Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans in a\npositive manner but avoids the hagiography and extravagant claims of\nthe later Neopythagorean tradition. The standard view is that he tries\nto emphasize the rational as opposed to the religious side of\nPythagoras (e.g. Burkert 1972a, 200\u2013205), but several fragments\ndo highlight the religious aspect of Pythagoras\u2019 work, assigning\nhim the doctrine of metempsychosis (fr. 12) and associating him with\nthe Chaldaean Zaratas (Fr. 13) and the Delphic oracle (Fr. 15). It is\nonly by rejecting the authenticity of such fragments (as does Zhmud\n2012a, 88\u201391) that Aristoxenus\u2019 account is purged of\nreligious elements. Dicaearchus\u2019 account of Pythagoreas is also\nusually viewed as positive. He is supposed to have presented\nPythagoras as the model of the practical life as opposed to the\ncontemplative life (Jaeger 1948, 456; Kahn 2001, 68). However,\nDicaearchus presents a very sarcastic account of Pythagoras\u2019\nrebirths according to which he was reborn as the beautiful prostitute\nAlco (Fr. 42) and careful reading of his other accounts of Pythagoras\nsuggests that he may have presented him as a charismatic charlatan who\nbewitched his hearers (Fr. 42) and was seen as a threat to the\nestablished laws of the state and hence was refused entrance by such\ncity-states as Locri (Fr. 41a). Thus, Aristoxenus and Dicaearchus were\nas divided in their interpretation of Pythagoras as were Heraclitus\nand Empedocles in earlier centuries. The Peripatetic tradition as a\nwhole is in strong contrast, then, with the Academy insofar as it\nemphasizes Pythagoreans rather than Pythagoras himself. When\nPythagoras is mentioned, it is mostly in connection with the way of\nlife, and interpretations range from positive to strongly satirical\nbut in either case avoid the hagiography of the Neopythagorean\ntradition. \n\nIt is then one of the great paradoxes of the ancient Pythagorean\ntradition that Aristotle\u2019s successor, Theophrastus, evidently\naccepted the Academic lionization of Pythagoras, and identifies\nPlato\u2019s one and the indefinite dyad as belonging to the\nPythagoreans (Metaph. 11a27 ff.), although Aristotle is\nemphatic that this pair of principles in fact belong to Plato\n(Metaph. 987b25\u201327). Since Theophrastus\u2019 work,\nTenets in Natural Philosophy, was the basis of the later\ndoxographical tradition, it may be that Theophrastus is responsible\nfor the Neopythagorean Pythagoras of the Academy dominating the later\ndoxography, the Pythagoras who originated the one and the indefinite\ndyad (A\u00ebtius I 3. 8), but it may also be that the Pythagorean\nsections of the doxography were rewritten in the first century BCE,\nunder the influence of the Neopythagoreanism of that period (Burkert\n1972a, 62; Zhmud 2012a, 455).\n\nThe standard view has thus been that the Academy was the origin of\nNeopythagoreanism with its glorification of Pythagoras and its\ntendency to assign mature Platonic views back to Pythagoras and the\nPythagoreans. Aristotle and the Peripatetics on the other hand\ndiminish the role of Pythagoras himself and, while noting connections\nbetween Plato and the Pythagoreans, carefully distinguish Pythagorean\nphilosphy from Platonism. Zhmud has recently put forth a challenge to\nthis view arguing the situation is almost the reverse: the Academy in\ngeneral regards Pythagoras and Pythagoreans favorably but does not\nassign mature Platonic views to them, it is rather Aristotle who ties\nPlato closely to the Pythagoreans (2012a, 415\u2013456).\n4.2 The Pythagorean Pseudepigrapha\n\nAlthough the origins of Neopythagoreanism are thus found in the fourth\ncentury BCE, the figures more typically labeled Neopythagoreans belong\nto the upsurge in interest in Pythagoreanism that begins in the first\ncentury BCE and continues through the rest of antiquity. Before\nturning to these Neopythagoreans, it is important to discuss another\naspect of the later Pythagorean tradition, the Pythagorean\npseudepigrapha. Many more writings forged in the name of Pythagoras\nand other Pythagoreans have survived than genuine writings. Most of\nthe pseudepigrapha themselves only survive in excerpts quoted by\nanthologists such as John of Stobi, who created a collection of Greek\ntexts for the edification of his son in early fifth century CE. The\nmodern edition of these Pythagorean pseudepigrapha by Thesleff (1965)\nruns to some 245 pages.\n\nThere is much uncertainly as to when, where, why and by whom these\nworks were created. No one answer to these questions will fit all of\nthe treatises. Most scholars (e.g., Burkert 1972b, 40\u201344;\nCentrone 1990, 30\u201334, 41\u201344 and 1994) have chosen Rome or\nAlexandria between 150 BCE and 100 CE as the most likely time and\nplace for these compositions, since there was a strong resurgence of\ninterest in Pythagoreanism in these places at these times (see below).\nThesleff\u2019s view that the majority were composed in the third\ncentury BCE in southern Italy (1961 and 1972, 59) has found less\nfavor. Centrone argues convincingly that a central core of the\npseudepigrapha were forged in the first centuries BCE and CE in\nAlexandria, because of their close connection to Eudorus and Philo,\nwho worked in Alexandria in that period (Centrone 2014a). For an\noverview of the Pythagorean pseudepigrapha see Centrone 2014a and\nMoraux 1984, 605\u2013683.\n\nA number of motives probably led to the forgeries. The existence of\navid collectors of Pythagorean books such as Juba, King of Mauretania\n(see below), and the scarcity of authentic Pythagorean texts will have\nled to forgeries to sell for profit to the collectors. Other short\nletters or treatises may have originated as exercises for students in\nthe rhetorical schools (e.g., the assignment might have been to write\nthe letter that Archytas wrote to Dionysius II of Syracuse asking that\nPlato be freed; see Diogenes Laertius III 21\u201322). The contents\nof the treatises suggest, however, that the primary motivation was to\nprovide the Pythagorean texts to support the Neopythagorean position,\nfirst adumbrated in the early Academy, that Pythagoras was the source\nof all that is true in the Greek philosophical tradition. The\npseudepigrapha show the Pythagoreans anticipating the most\ncharacteristic ideas of Plato and Aristotle. Most of the treatises are\ncomposed in the Doric dialect (spoken in Greek S. Italy) but, apart\nfrom that concession to verisimilitude, there is little other attempt\nto make them appear to be archaic documents that anticipated Plato and\nAristotle. Instead, Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s philosophical\npositions are stated in a bald fashion using the exact Platonic and\nAristotelian terminology. In many cases, however, this glorification\nof Pythagoras may not have been the final goal. The ancient authority\nof Pythagoras was sometimes used to argue for a specific\ninterpretation of Plato, often an interpretation that showed Plato as\nhaving anticipated and having responded to criticisms of Aristotle.\nFor example, in defense of the interpretation of Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus, which defends Plato against Aristotle\u2019s\ncriticisms by claiming that the creation of the world in the\nTimaeus is metaphorical, a Platonist could point to the\nforged treatise of Timaeus of Locri which does present the generation\nas metaphorical but which can also be regarded as Plato\u2019s\nsource. These pseudo-Pythagorean treatises are adopting the same\nstrategy as Eudorus of Alexandria and thus may be more important for\ndebates within later Platonism than for Pythagoreanism per se\n(Bonazzi 2013). \n\nOne plausible explanation of the sudden proliferation of Pythagorean\npseudepigrapha in the first century BCE and first century CE is the\nreappearance of Aristotle\u2019s esoteric writings in the middle of\nthe first century BCE (Kalligas 2004, 39\u201342). In those treatises\nPlato is presented as adopting a pair of principles, the one and the\nindefinite dyad, which are not obvious in the dialogues, but which\nAristotle compares to the Pythagorean principles limit and unlimited\n(e.g., Metaph. 987b19\u2013988a1). Aristotle can be read,\nalthough probably incorrectly, as virtually identifying Platonism and\nPythagoreanism in these passages. Thus, Pythagorean enthusiasts may\nhave felt emboldened by this reading of Aristotle to create the\nsupposed original texts upon which Plato drew. They may also have\nfound support for this in Plato\u2019s making the south-Italian\nTimaeus his spokesman in the dialogue of the same name. It is thus not\nsurprising that the most famous of the pseudepigrapha is the treatise\nsupposedly written by this Timaeus of Locri (Marg 1972), which has\nsurvived complete and which is clearly intended to represent the\noriginal document on which Plato drew, although it, in fact, also\nresponds to criticisms made of Plato\u2019s dialogue in the first\ncouple of centuries after it was written (Ryle 1965, 176\u2013178).\nThe treatise of Timaeus of Locri is first mentioned by Nicomachus in\nthe second century CE (Handbook 11) and is thus commonly\ndated to the first century CE. Another complete short treatise (13\npages in Thesleff) is On the Nature of the Universe\nsupposedly by the Pythagorean Ocellus (Harder 1966), which has\npassages that are almost identical to passages in Aristotle\u2019s\nOn Generation and Corruption. Since Ocellus\u2019 work is\nfirst mentioned by the Roman polymath, Varro, scholars have dated it\nto the first half of the first century BCE. Although Plato was in\ngeneral more closely associated with the Pythagorean tradition than\nAristotle, a significant number of Pythagorean pseudepigrapha follow\n\u2018Ocellus\u2019 in drawing on Aristotle (see Karamanolis 2006,\n133\u2013135).\n\nIt is likely that in some cases letters were forged in order to\nauthenticate these forged treatises. Thus a correspondence between\nPlato and Archytas dealing with the acquisition of the writings of\nOcellus (Diogenes Laertius VIII 80\u201381) may be intended to\nvalidate the forgery in Ocellus\u2019 name (Harder 1966, 39ff). A\nletter from Lysis to Hipparchus (Thesleff 1965, 111\u2013114), which\nenjoyed considerable fame in the later tradition and is quoted by\nCopernicus, urges that the master\u2019s doctrines not be presented\nin public to the uninitiated and recounts Pythagoras\u2019\ndaughter\u2019s preservation of his \u201cnotebooks\u201d\n(hypomn\u00eamata) in secrecy, although she could have sold\nthem for much money (see Riedweg 2005, 120\u2013121). Burkert (1961,\n17\u201328) has argued that this letter was forged to authenticate\nthe \u201cPythagorean Notes\u201d from which Alexander Polyhistor\n(1st century BCE) derived his influential account of Pythagoreanism\n(Diogenes Laertius VIII 24\u201336 \u2014 see the end of this\nsection and for Alexander see section 4.5 below). While some of\nPythagoras\u2019 teachings were undoubtedly secret, many were not,\nand the claim of secrecy in the letter of Lysis is used to explain\nboth the previous lack of early Pythagorean documents and the recent\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of what are in reality forged documents, such\nas the notebooks.\n\nThere are fewer forged treatises in Pythagoras\u2019 name than in the\nname of other Pythagoreans and they are a very varied group suggesting\ndifferent origins. Callimachus, in the third century BCE, knew of a\nspurious astronomical work circulating in Pythagoras\u2019 name\n(Diogenes Laertius IX 23) and there may have been a similar work\nforged in the second century (Burkert 1961, 28\u201342). A group of\nthree books, On Education, On Statesmanship and\nOn Nature, were forged in Pythagoras\u2019 name sometime\nbefore the second century BCE (Diogenes Laertius VIII 6 and 9; Burkert\n1972a, 225). Heraclides Lembus, in the second century BCE, knew of at\nleast six other works in Pythagoras\u2019 name, all of which must\nhave been spurious, including a Sacred Discourse (Diogenes\nLaertius VIII 7). The thesis that the historical Pythagoras wrote a\nSacred Discourse should be rejected (Burkert 1972a, 219).\nThere was also a spurious treatise on the magical properties of plants\nand the Golden Verses, which are discussed further below\n(sect. 4.5). On the spurious treatises assigned to Pythagoras see\nCentrone 2014a, 316\u2013318.\n\nArchytas\n appears to have been the most popular name in which to forge\ntreatises. Some 45 pages are devoted to pseudo-Archytan treatises in\nThesleff\u2019s collection as compared to 30 pages for Pythagoras.\nThe most famous of the pseudo-Archytan texts is The Whole System\nof Categories, which, along with On Opposites,\nrepresents the attempt to claim Aristotle\u2019s system of categories\nfor the Pythagoreans. The pseudo-Archytan works on categories are very\nfrequently cited by the commentators on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories (e.g., Simplicius and Syrianus) and were regarded\nas authentic by them, but in fact include modifications made to\nAristotle\u2019s theory in the first century BCE and probably were\ncomposed in that century (Szlezak 1972). Another treatise, On\nPrinciples, is full of Aristotelian terminology such as\n\u201cform,\u201d \u201csubstance,\u201d and \u201cwhat\nunderlies\u201d; On Intelligence and Perception contains a\nparaphrase of the divided line passage in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic. There are also a series of pseudepigrapha on ethics\nby Archytas and other authors (Centrone 1990). Philolaus, the third\nmost famous Pythagorean after Pythagoras and Archytas, also turns up\nas the author of several spurious treatises, but a number of the\nforgeries were in the names of obscure or otherwise unknown\nPythagoreans. Thus, Callikratidas and Metopos are presented as\nanticipating Plato\u2019s doctrine of the tripartite soul and as\nusing Plato\u2019s exact language to articulate it (Thesleff 1965,\n103.5 and 118.1\u20134). Although there are indications that some\nancient scholars had doubts about the authenticity of the\npseudo-Pythagorean texts, for the most part they succeeded in their\npurpose all too well and were accepted as genuine texts on which Plato\nand Aristotle drew.\n\nAlthough the pseudepigrapha are too varied to admit of one origin,\nCentrone has recently argued that a core group of pseudepigrapha do\nappear to be part of a single project (2014a). They are written in\nDoric Greek (the dialect used in southern Italy where the Pythagoreans\nflourished) in order to give them the appearance of authenticity and\nshare a common style. There are some twenty-five treatises belonging\nto this group and they include some of the most famous pseudepigrapha,\nincluding the work by ps.-Timaeus that was supposed to be\nPlato\u2019s model, ps.-Archytas\u2019 works on categories and\nps.-Ocellus On the Universe. These treatises espouse the same\nbasic system and seem designed to cover all the basic fields of\nknowledge. The system is based on theory of principles in which God is\nthe supreme entity above a pair of principles, one of which is limited\nand the other unlimited, and which are identified with Aristotelian\nform and matter. This system is very similar to what is found in\nEudorus, a Platonist working in Alexandria in the fist cenutury BCE.\nStarting from these principles a common system is then developed which\napplies to theology, cosmology, ethics, and politics. The connections\nto Eudorus and to Philo who also worked in Alexandria, very much\nsuggest that this group of treatises was developed as a coherent\nproject in Alexandria sometime in the first century BCE or the first\ncentury CE.\n\nOne important group of Pythagorean pseudepigrapha are those forged in\nthe names of Pythagorean women. Although some work has been done on\nthem there is still a pressing need for a comprehensive collection of\nthese texts and a study of them in light of the most recent\nscholarship on Pythagoreanism. Pomeroy 2013 provides some useful\ncommentary but has serious drawbacks (see Centrone 2014b and Brodersen\n2014). Many of the texts are collected in Thesleff 1965 under the\nnames Theano, Periktione, Melissa, Myia and Phintys and taken together\noccupy about 15 pages of text. To Periktione are assigned two\nfragments from a treatise On the Harmony of a Woman.\nPeriktione is the name of Plato\u2019s mother and it is probable that\nhers is the famous name in which these works were forged. Two further\nfragments from On Wisdom are also assigned to her. These\nfragments show a strong similarity to fragments from a treatise with\nidentical title by Archytas and are likely to have been assigned to\nPeriktione by mistake. Two fragments from a work On the Temperance\nof a Woman are assigned to Phintys. For Theano, the most famous\nPythagorean woman (see 3.3 above), one fragment of a work On\nPiety is preserved as well as the titles of several other works,\nnumerous apophthegms and a number of letters. On Theano in the\npseudepigraphal tradition see Huizenga 2013, 96\u2013117. Melissa and\nMyia are represented by one letter each. With few exceptions the works\nfocus on female virtue, proper marital conduct, and practical issues\nsuch as how to choose a wet nurse and how to deal with slaves. The\nadvice is quite conservative, stressing obedience to one\u2019s\nhusband, chastity and temperance. There is little that is specifically\nPythagorean. Since the authors are pseudonymous it is impossible to be\nsure whether they were in fact written by women using female\npseudonyms or men using female pseudonyms (Huizenga 2013, 116). In the\ncase of the letters St\u00e4dele\u2019s edition (1980) is to be\npreferred to Thesleff (1965). The letters of Melissa and Myia along\nwith three letters of Theano are often found together in the\nmanuscript tradition and may have come to be seen as offering a\ncurriculum for the moral training of women (Huizenga 2013). Due to the\ndearth of preserved writings by women from the ancient world some have\nbeen tempted to suppose that the writings are genuine works by the\nnamed authors. However, as demonstrated above, Pythagorean\npseudepigrapha were very widespread and more common than genuine\nPythagorean works. In such a context the onus of proof is on someone\nwho wants to show that a work is genuine. The content of the writings\nby Pythagorean women is simply too general to make a convincing case\nthat a specific writing could only have been written by the supposed\nauthor rather than by a later forger. In fact, the writings by women\nfit the pattern of the rest of the pseudepigrapha very well. They are\ngenerally forged in the name of famous Pythagorean women, whose names\ngive authority to the advice imparted (Huizenga 2013, 117). How better\ncould one impart force to advice to women than to assign that advice\nto women who belonged to the philosophical school that gave most\nprominence to women? The pseudepigrapha written in the names of\nPythagorean women probably mostly date to the first centuries BCE and\nCE like the other Pythagorean pseudepigrapha, but certainty is not\npossible. \n\nOne of the most discussed treatises among the pseudepigrapha are the\nPythagorean Notes, which were excerpted by Alexander\nPolyhistor in the first century BCE, who was in turn quoted by\nDiogenes Laertius in his Life of Pythagoras (VIII\n24\u201333). Thus the Notes date before the middle of the\nfirst century BCE (probably towards the end of the third century BCE\n[Burkert 1972a, 53]) and are earlier than most pseudepigrapha. In\nDiogenes\u2019 life the Pythagorean Notes serve as the main\nstatement of Pythagoras\u2019 philosophical views. The treatise is\nwildly eclectic, drawing from Plato\u2019s Timaeus, the\nearly Academy and Stocisim and the scholarly consensus is that the\ntreatise is a forgery (Burkert 1961, 26ff., Long 2013, Laks 2014). It\nis tempting to suppose that some early material may be preserved\namidst later material, but the text is such an amalgam that it is in\npractice impossible to identify securely any early material (Burkert\n1961, 26; Laks 2014, 375). The Notes are well organized and\npresent a complete if compressed philosophy organized around the\nconcept of purity (Laks 2014). Starting from basic principles (the\nPlatonic monad and dyad) they give an account of the world, living\nbeings, and the soul ending with moral precepts (some of the\nPythagorean acusmata). Kahn thought that the treatise\nreflected a Pythagorean community that was active in the Hellenistic\nperiod (2001, 83) but Long is more likely to be right that its learned\neclecticism suggests that it is a scholarly creation (Long 2013,\n158\u2013159).\n4.3 Neopythagorean Metaphysics: Eudorus, Moderatus, Numenius and Hippolytus\n\n\u201cNeopythagorean\u201d is a modern label, which overlaps with\ntwo other modern labels, \u201cMiddle Platonist\u201d and\n\u201cNeoplatonist,\u201d so that a given figure will be called a\nNeoplatonist or Middle Platonist by some scholars and a Neopythagorean\nby others. There are several different strands in Neopythagoreanism.\nOne strand focuses on Pythagoras as a master metaphysician. In this\nguise he is presented as the author of a theory of principles, which\nwent even beyond the principles of Plato\u2019s later metaphysics,\nthe one and the indefinite dyad, and which shows similarities to the\nNeoplatonic system of Plotinus. The first Neopythagorean in this sense\nis Eudorus of Alexandria, who was active in the middle and later part\nof the first century BCE. He evidently presented his own innovations\nas the work of the Pythagoreans (Dillon 1977, 119). According to\nEudorus, the Pythagoreans posited a single supreme principle, known as\nthe one and the supreme god, which is the cause of all things. Below\nthis first principle are a second one, which is also called the monad,\nand the indefinite dyad. These latter two are Plato\u2019s principles\nin the unwritten doctrines, but Eudorus says they are properly\nspeaking elements rather than principles (Simplicius, in\nPhys., CAG IX 181. 10\u201330). The system of\nprinciples described by Eudorus also appears in the pseudo-Pythagorean\nwritings (e.g., pseudo-Archytas, On Principles; Thesleff\n1965, 19) and it is hard to be certain in which direction the\ninfluence went (Dillon 1977, 120\u2013121). On Eudorus\u2019\nconnection to the pseudo-Pythagorean writings see also Bonazzi 2013\nand Centrone 2014. A generation after Eudorus, another Alexandrian,\nthe Jewish thinker Philo, used a Pythagorean theory of principles,\nwhich is similar to that found in Eudorus, and Pythagorean number\nsymbolism in order to give a philosophical interpretation of the\nOld Testament (Kahn 2001, 99\u2013104; Dillon 1977,\n139\u2013183). Philo\u2019s goal was to show that Moses was the\nfirst philosopher. For Philo Pythagoras and his travels to the east\nevidently played a crucial role in the transmission of philosophy to\nthe Greeks (Dillon 2014). Philo like Eudorus has close connections to\nthe Pythagorean pseudepigrapha (Centrone 2014). \n\nModeratus of Gades (modern Cadiz in Spain), who was active in the\nfirst century CE, shows similarities to Eudorus in his treatment of\nPythagorean principles. Plutarch explicitly labels him a Pythagorean\nand presents his follower, Lucius, as living a life in accord with the\nPythagorean taboos, known as symbola or acusmata\n(Table Talk 727b). It is thus tempting to assume that\nModeratus too lived a Pythagorean life (Dillon 1977, 345). His\nphilosophy is only preserved in reports of other thinkers, and it is\noften difficult to distinguish what belongs to Moderatus from what\nbelongs to the source.\n\nHe wrote a comprehensive eleven volume work entitled Lectures on\nPythagoreanism from which Porphyry quotes in sections 48\u201353\nof his Life of Pythagoras. In this passage, Moderatus argues\nthat the Pythagoreans used numbers as a way to provide clear teaching\nabout bodiless forms and first principles, which cannot be expressed\nin words. In another excerpt, he describes a Pythagorean system of\nprinciples, which appears to be developed from the first two\ndeductions of the second half of Plato\u2019s Parmenides. In\nthis system there are three ones: the first one which is above being,\na second one which is identified with the forms and which is\naccompanied by intelligible matter (i.e. the indefinite dyad) and a\nthird one which is identified with soul. The first two ones show\nconnections to Eudorus\u2019 account of Pythagorean first principles;\nthe whole system anticipates central ideas of the most important\nNeoplatonist, Plotinus (Dillon 1977, 346\u2013351; Kahn 2001,\n105\u2013110).\n\nModeratus was a militant Neopythagorean, who explicitly charges that\nPlato, Aristotle and members of the early academy claimed as their own\nthe most fruitful aspects of Pythagorean philosophy with only small\nchanges, leaving for the Pythagoreans only those doctrines that were\nsuperficial, trivial and such as to bring discredit on the school\n(Porphyry, VP 53). These trivial doctrines have been thought\nto be the various taboos preserved in the symbola, but, since\nhis follower Lucius is explicitly said to follow the symbola,\nit seems unlikely that Moderatus was critical of them. The charge of\nplagiarism might suggest that Moderatus was familiar with the\npseudo-Pythagorean treatises, which appear to have been forged in part\nto show that Pythagoras had anticipated the main ideas of Plato and\nAristotle (see Kahn 2001, 105).\n\nIt is with Numenius (see Dillon 1977, 361\u2013379 and Kahn 2001,\n118\u2013133, and the entry on\n Numenius,\n especially section 2), who flourished ca. 150 CE in Apamea in\nnorthern Syria (although he may have taught at Rome), that\nNeopythagoreanism has the clearest direct contact with the great\nNeoplatonist, Plotinus. Porphyry reports that Plotinus was, in fact,\naccused of having plagiarized from Numenius and that, in response,\nAmelius, a devotee of Numenius\u2019 writings and follower of\nPlotinus, wrote a treatise entitled Concerning the Difference\nBetween the Doctrines of Plotinus and Numenius (Life of\nPlotinus 3 and 17). The third century Platonist, Longinus, to a\ndegree describes Plotinus himself as a Neopythagorean, saying that\nPlotinus developed the exegesis of Pythagorean and Platonic first\nprinciples more clearly than his predecessors, who are identified as\nNumenius, his follower Cronius, Moderatus and Thrasyllus, all\nNeopythagoreans (Porphyry, Life of Plotinus 20). Numenius\nalso had considerable influence on Porphyry (Macris 2014, 396),\nIamblichus (O\u2019Meara 2014, 404\u2013405) and Calcidius (Hicks\n2014, 429).\n\nNumenius is regularly described as a Pythagorean by the sources that\ncite his fragments such as Eusebius (e.g. Fr. 1, 4b, 5 etc. Des\nPlaces). He presents himself as returning to the teaching of Plato and\nthe early Academy. That teaching is in turn presented as deriving from\nPythagoras. Plato is described as \u201cnot better than the great\nPythagoras but perhaps not inferior to him either\u201d (Fr. 24 Des\nPlaces). Strikingly, Numenius presents Socrates too as a Pythagorean,\nwho worshipped the three Pythagorean gods recognized by Numenius (see\nbelow). Thus Plato derived his Pythagoreanism both from direct contact\nwith Pythagoreans and also from Socrates (Karamanolis 2006,\n129\u2013132). For Numenius a true philosopher adheres to the\nteaching of his master, and he wrote a polemical treatise, directed\nparticularly at the skeptical New Academy, with the title On the\nRevolution of the Academics against Plato (Fr. 24 Des Places).\nNumenius presents the Pythagorean philosophy to which Plato adhered as\nultimately based on a still earlier philosophy, which can be found in\nEastern thinkers such as the Magi, Brahmans, Egyptian priests and the\nHebrews (Fr. 1 Des Places). Thus, Numenius was reported to have asked\n\u201cWhat else is Plato than Moses speaking Greek?\u201d (Fr. 8 Des\nPlaces).\n\nNumenius presents his own doctrine of matter, which is clearly\ndeveloped out of Plato\u2019s Timaeus, as the work of\nPythagoras (Fr. 52 Des Places). Matter in its disorganized state is\nidentified with the indefinite dyad. Numenius argues that for\nPythagoras the dyad was a principle independent of the monad; later\nthinkers, who tried to derive the dyad from the monad (he does not\nname names but Eudorus, Moderatus and the Pythagorean system described\nby Alexander Polyhistor fit the description), were thus departing from\nthe original teaching. In emphasizing that the monad and dyad are\nindependent principles, Numenius is indeed closer to the Pythagorean\ntable of opposites described by Aristotle and to Plato\u2019s\nunwritten doctrines. Since it is in motion, disorganized matter must\nhave a soul, so that the world and the things in it have two souls,\none evil derived from matter and one good derived from reason.\nNumenius avoids complete dualism in that reason does have ultimate\ndominion over matter, thus making the world as good as possible, given\nthe existence of the recalcitrant matter.\n\nThe monad, which is opposed to the indefinite dyad, is just one of\nthree gods for Numenius (Fr. 11 Des Places), who here follows\nModeratus to a degree. The first god is equated with the good, is\nsimple, at rest and associates only with itself. The second god is the\ndemiurge, who by organizing matter divides himself so that a third god\narises, who is either identified with the organized cosmos or its\nanimating principle, the world soul (Dillon 1977, 366\u2013372).\nNumenius is famous for the striking images by means of which he\nelucidated his philosophy, such as the comparison of the helmsman, who\nsteers his ship by looking at the heavens, to the demiurge, who steers\nmatter by looking to the first god (Fr. 18 Des Places).\nNumenius\u2019 argument that there is a first god above the demiurge\nis paralleled by a passage in another treatise, which shows\nconnections to Neopythagorean metaphysics, The Chaldaean\nOracles (Majercik 1989), which were published by Julian the\nTheurgist, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius (161\u2013180 CE) and\nthus at about the same time as Numenius was active. It is hard to know\nwhich way the influence went (Dillon 1977, 363).\n\nIn The Refutation of all Heresies, the Christian bishop\nHippolytus (died ca. 235 CE) adopts the strategy of showing that\nChristian heresies are in fact based on the mistaken views of pagan\nphilosophers. Hippolytus spends considerable time describing\nPythagoreanism, since he regards it as the primary source for gnostic\nheresy (see Mansfeld 1992 for this and what follows).\nHippolytus\u2019 presentation of Pythagoreanism, which groups\ntogether Pythagoras, Plato, Empedocles and Heraclitus into a\nPythagorean succession, belongs to a family of Neopythagorean\ninterpretations of Pythagoreanism developed in the first century BCE\nand the first two centuries CE and which also appear in later\ncommentators such as Syrianus and Philoponus. Hippolytus\u2019\ninterpretation shows similarities to material in Eudorus, Philo\nJudaeus, Plutarch and Numenius among others, although he adapts the\nmaterial to fit his own purposes. He regards Platonism and\nPythagoreanism as the same philosophy, which ultimately derives from\nEgypt. Empedocles is regarded as a Pythagorean and is quoted,\nsometimes without attribution, as evidence for Pythagorean views.\nAccording to Hippolytus the Monad and the Dyad are the two Pythagorean\nprinciples, although the Dyad is derived from the Monad. The\nPythagoreans recognize two worlds, the intelligible, which has the\nMonad as its principle, and the sensible, whose principle is the\ntetraktys, the first four numbers, which correspond to the\npoint, line, surface and solid. The tetraktys contains the\ndecad, since the sum of 1, 2, 3 and 4 is 10, and this is embodied in\nthe ten Aristotelian categories, which describe the sensible world.\nThe pseudo-Archytan treatise,  The Whole System of\nCategories, had already claimed this Aristotelian doctrine for\nthe Pythagoreans (see 4.2 above). Finally, the intelligible world is\nequated with Empedocles\u2019 sphere controlled by the uniting power\nof Love in contrast to the world of sense perception in which the\ndividing power of Strife plays the role of the demiurge\n(Refutation of all Heresies 6, 23\u201325).\n4.4 Neopythagorean Mathematical Sciences: Nicomachus, Porphyry and Iamblichus\n\nA second strand of Neopythagoreanism, while maintaining connection to\nthese metaphysical speculations, emphasizes Pythagoras\u2019 role in\nthe mathematical sciences. Nicomachus of Gerasa (modern Jerash in\nJordan) was probably active a little before Numenius, in the first\nhalf of the second century CE. Unlike Neopythagoreans such as Eudorus,\nModeratus and Numenius, whose works only survive in fragments, two\ncomplete works of Nicomachus survive, Introduction to\nArithmetic and Handbook of Music. More than anyone else\nin antiquity he was responsible for popularizing supposed Pythagorean\nachievements in mathematics and the sciences. The Handbook of\nMusic gives the canonical but scientifically impossible story of\nPythagoras\u2019 discovery of the whole number ratios, which\ncorrespond to the basic concordant intervals in music: the octave\n(2:1), fifth (3:2), and fourth (4:3); he supposedly heard the concords\nin the sounds produced by hammers of varying weights in a\nblacksmith\u2019s shop, which he happened to be passing (Chapter 6\n\u2014 translation in Barker 1989, 256 ff.). In the next century,\nIamblichus took this chapter over virtually verbatim and without\nacknowledgement in his On the Pythagorean Life (Chapter 26)\nand it was repeated in many later authors. The harmonic theory\npresented by Nicomachus in the Handbook is not original and\nis, in fact, somewhat retrograde. It is tied to the diatonic scale\nused by Plato in the Timaeus (35b-36b), which was previously\nused by the Pythagorean Philolaus in the fifth-century (Fr. 6a) and\nshows no awareness of or interest in the more sophisticated analysis\nof Archytas in the fourth century BCE. Nicomachus is not concerned\nwith musical practice but with \u201cwhat pure reasoning can reveal\nabout the properties of a rationally impeccable and unalterable system\nof quantitative relations\u201d (Barker 2007, 447). Nicomachus also\nrelies heavily and without acknowledgement on a non-Pythagorean\ntreatment of music, Aristoxenus\u2019 Elementa Harmonica,\nmany of the ideas of which he assigns to the Pythagoreans (e.g., in\nChapter 2; see Barker 1989, 245 ff.).\n\nThe Handbook was influential because it put forth an\naccessible version of Pythagorean harmonics (Barker 2014,\n200\u2013202). Nicomachus provided a more detailed treatment of\nPythagorean harmonics in his lost Introduction to Music. Most\nscholars agree that Books I-III and perhaps Book IV of Boethius\u2019\nDe Institutione Musica are a close paraphrase, which is often\nessentially a translation, of Nicomachus\u2019 lost work (see Bower\nin Boethius 1989, xxviii and Barker 2007, 445). Even more influential\nthan his work on harmonics was Nicomachus\u2019 Introduction to\nArithmetic. Again Nicomachus was not an original or particularly\ntalented mathematician, but this popularizing textbook was widely\ninfluential. There were a series of commentaries on it by Iamblichus\n(3rd CE), Asclepius of Tralles (6th CE), and Philoponus (6th CE) and\nit was translated into Latin already in the second half of the second\ncentury by Apuleius. Most importantly, Boethius (5th-6th CE) provides\nwhat is virtually a translation of it in his De Institutione\nArithmetica, which became the standard work on arithmetic in the\nmiddle ages. On Boethius\u2019 use of Nicomachus see Hicks 2014,\n422\u2013424.\n\nIn the Introduction to Arithmetic, Nicomachus assigns to\nPythagoras the Platonic division between the intelligible and sensible\nworld, quoting the Timaeus as if it were a Pythagorean text\n(I 2). He also assigns Aristotelian ideas to Pythagoras, in particular\na doctrine of immaterial attributes with similarities to the\nAristotelian categories (I 1). Nicomachus divides reality into two\nforms, magnitude and multitude. Wisdom is then knowledge of these two\nforms, which are studied by the four sciences, which will later be\nknown as the quadrivium: arithmetic, music, geometry and\nastronomy. He quotes a genuine fragment of Archytas (Fr. 1) in support\nof the special position of these four sciences. Nicomachus presents\narithmetic as the most important of the four, because it existed in\nthe mind of the creating god (the demiurge) as the plan which he\nfollowed in ordering the cosmos (I 4), so that numbers thus appear to\nhave replaced the Platonic forms as the model of creation (on forms\nand numbers in Nicomachus see Helmig 2007). It is striking that, along\nwith this Platonization of Pythagoreanism, Nicomachus does give an\naccurate presentation of Philolaus\u2019 basic metaphysical\nprinciples, limiters and unlimiteds, before attempting to equate them\nwith the Platonic monad and dyad (II 18).\n\nAnother work by Nicomachus, The Theology of Arithmetic, which\ncan be reconstructed from a summary by Photius and an anonymous work\nsometimes ascribed to Iamblichus and known as the Theologoumena\nArithmeticae (Dillon 1977, 352\u2013353), suggests that he\nlargely returned to the system of principles found in Plato\u2019s\nunwritten doctrines and did not follow Eudorus and Moderatus in\nattempts to place a supreme god above the demiurge. Nicomachus\napparently presents the monad as the first principle and demiurge,\nwhich then generates the dyad, but much is unclear (Dillon 1977,\n353\u2013358). The Theology of Arithmetic may have been most\ninfluential in its attempt to set up an equivalence between the pagan\ngods and the numbers in the decad, which was picked up later by\nIamblichus and Proclus (Kahn 2001, 116). Nicomachus also wrote a\nLife of Pythagoras, which has not survived but which Porphyry\n(e.g., VP 59) and Iamblichus used (Rohde 1871\u20131872;\nO\u2019Meara 2014, 412\u2013413).\n\nAfter Plotinus (205\u2013270 CE), Neopythagoreanism becomes absorbed\ninto Neoplatonism. Although Plotinus was clearly influenced by\nNeopythagorean speculation on first principles (see above), he was not\na Neopythagorean himself, in that he did not assign Pythagoras a\nprivileged place in the history of Greek philosophy. Plotinus treats\nPythagoras as just one among many predecessors, complains of the\nobscurities of his thought and labels Plato and not Pythagoras as\ndivine (Enneads IV 8.11 ff.).\n\nThe earliest extant Life of Pythagoras is that of Diogenes\nLaertius, who was active ca. 200 CE. The most recent treatment of\nDiogenes\u2019 life is Laks 2014, on which much of what follows\ndepends. Unlike his successors Porphyry and Iamblichus (see below)\nDiogenes had no philosophical affiliation and hence no philosophical\naxe to grind in presenting the life of Pythagoras. Indeed, it is\nstriking that his life shows little influence from the Neopythagorean\nauthors discussed above. Diogenes draws on a wide variety of important\nsources, some going back to the fourth century and others deriving\nfrom the Hellenistic period. This material is put together in a very\nloose, sometimes undetectable, organizational structure. There is a\nnotable section on Pythagoras\u2019 supposed writings (VIII,\n6\u20137). He shows particular interest in the Pythagorean way of\nlife and quotes a large number of Pythagorean symbola for\nsome of which his source was Aristotle (VIII 34\u201335). The main\nsection on Pythagoras\u2019 philosophical doctrines is a long\nquotation from the first-century polymath Alexander Polyhistor who\nclaims to be in turn drawing on a treatise called Pythagorean\nNotes (VIII 24\u201333). For more on this treatise see the\nsection on Pythagorean pseudepigrapha above (4.2). Diogenes quotes a\nnumber of passages satirizing Pythagoras, including Xenophanes\u2019\nfamous puppy fragment, and presents some of his own epigrams making\nfun of the Pythagorean way of life (VIII, 36). However, other parts of\nhis life present Pythagoras in a quite postive light so that it is\nhard to determine precisely what attitude Diogenes took towards\nPythagoras (Laks 2014, 377\u2013380).\n\nThe Life of Pythagoras by Plotinus\u2019 pupil and editor,\nPorphyry (234-ca. 305) is one of our most important sources for\nPythagoreanism (For what follows see Macris 2014). It was originally\npart of his now lost Philosophical History. Continuing\ninterest in Pythagoras in later centuries led the Life of\nPythagoras to be preserved separately and it is the only large\nsection of the Philosophical History to survive. The\nPhilosophical History  ended with Plato and clearly regarded\nPlatonic philosophy as the true philosophy so that Pythagoras seems to\nhave been highlighted as a key figure in the development of\nPlato\u2019s philosophy. Porphyry\u2019s Life of Pythagoras\nis particularly valuable, because he often clearly identifies his\nsources. This same penchant for identifying and seeking out important\nPythagorean sources can be seen in his commentary on Ptolemy\u2019s\nHarmonics (2nd CE), in which he preserves several genuine\nfragments of the early Pythagorean Archytas, along with some\npseudo-Pythagorean material. In the Life of Pythagoras\nPorphyry does not structure his information according to any\noverarching theme but instead sets out the information derived from\nother sources in a simple and orderly way with the minimum of\neditorial intervention. Although he cites some fifteen sources, some\ngoing back to the fourth century BCE, it is likely that he did not use\nmost of these sources but rather found them quoted in the four main\nsources, which he used directly: 1) Nicomachus\u2019 Life of\nPythagoras, 2) Moderatus\u2019 Lectures on\nPythagoreanism, 3) Antonius Diogenes\u2019 novel\nUnbelievable Things Beyond Thule, and 4) a handbook of some\nsort. Since these sources come from the first and second centuries CE,\nPorphyry basically provides us with the picture of Pythagoras common\nin Middle Platonism. This Pythagoras is the prototype of the sage of\nold who was active as a teacher and tied to religious mystery.\nHowever, he is not yet Iamblichus\u2019 priviliged soul sent to save\nhumanity (Macris, 2014, 390). Porphyry provides little criticism of\nhis sources and, although his life has a neutral factual tone, in\ncontrast to Diogenes Laertius in his Life of Pythagoras, he\nincludes no negative reports about Pythagoras.\n\nIt would appear, however, that Pythagoras was not made the source of\nall Greek philosophy, but was rather presented as one of a number of\nsages both Greek and non-Greek (e.g., Indians, Egyptians and Hebrews),\nwho promulgated a divinely revealed philosophy. This philosophy is, in\nfact, Platonic in origin as it relies on the Platonic distinction\nbetween the intelligible and sensible realms; Porphyry unhistorically\nassigns it back to these earlier thinkers, including Pythagoras.\nPythagoras\u2019 philosophy is thus said to aim at freeing the mind\nfrom the fetters of the body so that it can attain a vision of the\nintelligible and eternal beings (Life of Pythagoras\n46\u201347). O\u2019Meara thus seems correct to conclude that\nPorphyry was \u201c\u2026not a Pythagoreanizing Platonist \u2026\nbut rather a universalizing Platonist: he finds his Platonism both in\nPythagoras and in very many other quarters\u201d (1989, 25\u201329).\nPorphyry himself lived an ascetic life that was probably largely\ninspired by Pythagoreanism (Macris 2014, 393\u2013394).\n\nPorphyry\u2019s pupil, Iamblichus (ca. 245- ca. 325 CE), from Chalcis\nin Syria, opposed his teacher on many issues in Neoplatonic philosophy\nand was responsible for a systematic Pythagoreanization of\nNeoplatonism (see O\u2019 Meara 1989 and 2014), particularly under\nthe influence of Nicomachus\u2019 earlier treatment of Pythagorean\nwork in the quadrivium. Iamblichus wrote a work in ten books\nentitled On Pythagoreanism. The first four books have\nsurvived intact and excerpts of Books V-VII are preserved by the\nByzantine scholar Michael Psellus. Book One, On the Pythagorean\nLife, has biographical aspects but is primarily a detailed\ndescription of and a protreptic for the Pythagorean way of life. It\nmight be that Iamblichus\u2019 Pythagoras is intended in part as a\npagan rival to Christ and to Christianity, which was gaining strength\nat this time. Porphyry, indeed, had written a treatise Against the\nChristians, now lost. In Iamblichus, Pythagoras\u2019 miraculous\ndeeds include a meeting at the beginning of his career with fishermen\nhauling in a catch (VP 36; cf. Matthew 1. 16\u201320; see\nIamblichus, On the Pythagorean Life, Dillon and Hershbell\n(eds.) 1991, 25\u201326). O\u2019Meara, on the other hand, doubts\nthis connection to Christ (2014, 405 n. 21) and suggests that\nIamblichus may have constructed Pythagoras as a rival to\nPorphyry\u2019s presentation of Plotinus as the model philosopher\n(1989, 214\u2013215). In the end we cannot be certain whether\nIamblichus is responding to Porphyry or Porphyry to Iamblichus, but\nthey can be seen as battling over Plato\u2019s legacy (O\u2019Meara\n2014, 403). Porphyry in his Life of Plotinus and edition of\nhis works is promoting Plotinus\u2019 interpretation of Plato.\nIamblichus, on the other hand, advocates a return to the philosophy\nthat inspired Plato, Pythagoreanism. Pythagorean philosophy is\nportrayed by Iamblichus as a gift of the gods, which cannot be\ncomprehended without their aid; Pythagoras himself was sent down to\nmen to provide that aid (VP 1).\n\nIamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life is largely a\ncompilation of earlier sources but, unlike Porphyry, he does not\nusually identify them. Rohde (1871\u20131872) argued influentially\nthat  On the Pythagorean Life was largely a compilation from\ntwo sources: Nicomachus\u2019 Life of Pythagoras and a life\nof Pythagoras by Apollonius of Tyana. O\u2019Meara argues that this\nunderestimates both the extent to which Iamblichus reworked his\nsources for his own philosophical purposes and the variety of sources\nthat he used (O\u2019Meara 2014, 412\u2013415). A particularly clear\nexample of Iamblichus\u2019 distintive development of ideas found in\nearlier sources can be seen in his treatment of the doctrine of the\nharmony of the spheres (O\u2019Meara 2007). It is also true that the\nremaining books of On Pythgoreanism use a variety of sources.\nBook Two, Protreptic to Philosophy, is an exhortation to\nphilosophy in general and to Pythagorean philosophy in particular and\nrelies heavily on Aristotle\u2019s lost Protrepticus. Book\nThree, On General Mathematical Science, deals with the\ngeneral value of mathematics in aiding our comprehension of the\nintelligible realm and is followed by a series of books on the\nspecific sciences. The treatment of arithmetic in Book IV takes the\nform of a commentary on Nicomachus\u2019 Introduction to\nArithmetic. Books V-VII then dealt with arithmetic in physics,\nethics and theology respectively and were followed by treatments of\nthe other three sciences in the quadrivium: On Pythagorean\nGeometry, On Pythagorean Music and On Pythagorean\nAstronomy. Iamblichus was particularly interested in Pythagorean\nnumerology and his section on arithmetic in theology is probably\nreflected in the anonymous treatise which has survived under the title\nTheologoumena Arithmeticae and which has sometimes been\nascribed to Iamblichus himself. It appears that here again Iamblichus\nrelied heavily on Nicomachus, this time on his Theology of\nArithmetic.\n\nIt is possible that Iamblichus used the ten Books of On\nPythagoreanism as the basic text in his school, but we know that\nhe went beyond these books to the study of Aristotelian logic and the\nPlatonic dialogues, particularly the Timaeus and\nParmenides (Kahn 2001, 136\u2013137). Nonetheless, it was\nbecause of Iamblichus that Pythagoreanism in the form of numerology\nand mathematics in general was emphasized by later Neoplatonists such\nas Syrianus (fl. 430 CE) and Proclus (410/412\u2013485 CE). Proclus\nis reported to have dreamed that he was the reincarnation of\nNicomachus (Marinus, Life of Proclus 28). Proclus did treat\nPlato\u2019s writings as clearer than the somewhat obscure writings\nof the Pythagoreans but his Platonism is still heavily Pythagorean\n(O\u2019 Meara 2014, 415). The successors of Proclus appear to follow\nhis and Iamblichus\u2019 interpretation of Pythagoras (O\u2019Meara\n2013).\n4.5 Pythagoreans as Relgious Experts, Magicians and Moral Exemplars: Pythagoreanism in Rome, The Golden Verses and Apollonius of Tyana\n\nA third strand in Neopythagoreanism emphasizes Pythagoras\u2019\npractices rather than his supposed metaphysical system. This\nPythagoras is an expert in religious and magical practices and/or a\nsage who lived the ideal moral life, upon whom we should model our\nlives. This strand is closely connected to the striking interest in\nand prominence of Pythagoreanism in Roman literature during the first\ncentury BCE and first century CE. Cicero (106\u201343 BCE) in\nparticular refers to Pythagoras and other Pythagoreans with some\nfrequency. In De Finibus (V 2), he presents himself as the\nexcited tourist, who, upon his arrival in Metapontum in S. Italy and\neven before going to his lodgings, sought out the site where\nPythagoras was supposed to have died. At the beginning of Book IV\n(1\u20132) of the Tusculan Disputations, Cicero notes that\nPythagoras gained his fame in southern Italy at just the same time\nthat L. Brutus freed Rome from the tyranny of the kings and founded\nthe Republic; there is a clear implication that Pythagorean ideas,\nwhich reached Rome from southern Italy, had an influence on the early\nRoman Republic. Cicero goes on to assert explicitly that many Roman\nusages were derived from the Pythagoreans, although he does not give\nspecifics. According to Cicero, it was admiration for Pythagoras that\nled Romans to suppose, without noticing the chronological\nimpossibility, that the wisest of the early Roman kings, Numa, who was\nsupposed to have ruled from 715\u2013673 BCE, had been a pupil of\nPythagoras.\n\nIn addition to references to Pythagoras himself, Cicero refers to the\nPythagorean Archytas some eleven times, in particular emphasizing his\nhigh moral character, as revealed in his refusal to punish in anger\nand his suspicion of bodily pleasure (Rep. I 38. 59;\nSen. XII 39\u201341). Cicero\u2019s own philosophy is not\nmuch influenced by the Pythagoreans except in The Dream of\nScipio (Rep. VI 9), which owes even more to Plato.\n\nThe interest in Pythagoras and Pythagoreans in the first century BCE\nis not limited to Cicero, however. Both a famous ode of Horace (I 28)\nand a brief reference in Propertius (IV 1) present Archytas as a\nmaster astronomer. Most striking of all is the speech assigned to\nPythagoras that constitutes half of Book XV of Ovid\u2019s\nMetamorphoses (early years of the first century CE) and that\ncalls for strict vegetarianism in the context of the doctrine of\ntransmigration of souls. These latter themes are true to the earliest\nevidence for Pythagoras, but the rest of Ovid\u2019s presentation\nassigns to Pythagoras a doctrine that is derived from a number of\nearly Greek philosophers and in particular the doctrine of flux\nassociated with Heraclitus (Kahn 2001, 146\u2013149).\n\nThis flourishing of Pythagoreanism in Roman literature of the golden\nage has its roots in one of the earliest Roman literary figures,\nEnnius (239\u2013169 BCE), who, in his poem Annales, adopts\nthe Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis, in presenting himself as\nthe reincarnation of Homer, although he does not mention Pythagoras by\nname in the surviving fragments. Roman nationalism also played a role\nin the emphasis on Pythagoreanism at Rome. Since Pythagoras did his\nwork in Italy and Aristotle even referred to Pythagoreanism in some\nplaces as the philosophy of the Italians (e.g., Metaph.\n987a10), it is not surprising that the Romans wanted to emphasize\ntheir connections to Pythagoras. This is particularly clear in\nCicero\u2019s references to Pythagoreanism but once again finds its\nroots even earlier. In 343 BCE during the war with the Samnites,\nApollo ordered the Romans to erect one statue of the wisest and\nanother of the bravest of the Greeks; their choice for the former was\nPythagoras and for the latter Alcibiades. Pliny, who reports the story\n(Nat. XXXIV 26), expresses surprise that Socrates was not\nchosen for the former, given that, according to Plato\u2019s\nApology, Apollo himself had labeled Socrates the wisest; it\nis surely the Italian connection that explains the Romans\u2019\nchoice of Pythagoras. Cicero (not Aristoxenus as suggested by Horky\n2011) connects the great wisdom assigned to the Samnite Herrenius\nPontius to his contact with the Pythagorean Archytas (On Old\nAge 41). This Roman attempt to forge a connection with Pythagoras\ncan also be seen in the report of Plutarch (Aem. Paul. 1)\nthat some writers traced the descent of the Aemelii, one of\nRome\u2019s leading families, to Pythagoras, by claiming\nPythagoras\u2019 son Mamercus as the founder of the house.\n\nAlthough Rome\u2019s special connection to Pythagoras thus had\nearlier roots, those roots alone do not explain the efflorescence of\nPythagoreanism in golden age Latin literature; some stimulus probably\ncame from the rebirth of what were seen as Pythagorean practices in\nthe way certain people lived. The two most learned figures in Rome of\nthe first century BCE, Nigidius Figulus and Varro, both have\nconnections to Pythagorean ritual practices. Thus we are told that\nVarro (116\u201327 BCE) was buried according to the Pythagorean\nfashion in myrtle, olive and black poplar leaves (Pliny, Nat.\nXXXV 160). Amongst Varro\u2019s voluminous works was the\nHebdomad\u00eas (\u201cSevens\u201d), a\ncollection of 700 portraits of famous men, in the introduction to\nwhich Varro engaged in praise for the number 7, which is similar to\nthe numerology of later Neopythagorean works such as Nicomachus\u2019\nTheology of Arithmetic; in another work Varro presents a\ntheory of gestation, which has Pythagorean connections, in that it is\nbased on the whole number ratios that correspond to the concordant\nintervals in music (Rawson 1985, 161).\n\nIt is Nigidius Figulus, praetor in 58, who died in exile in 45,\nhowever, who is usually identified as the figure who was responsible\nfor reviving Pythagorean practices. In the preface to his translation\nof Plato\u2019s Timaeus, which is often treated as virtually\na Pythagorean treatise by the Neopythagoreans, Cicero asserts of\nNigidius that \u201cfollowing on those noble Pythagoreans, whose\nschool of philosophy had to a certain degree died out, \u2026 this\nman arose to revive it.\u201d Some scholars are dubious about this\nclaim of Cicero. They point to the evidence cited above for the\nimportance of Pythagoreanism in Rome in the two centuries before\nNigidius and suggest that Cicero may be illegitimately following\nAristoxenus\u2019 claim that Pythagoreanism died out in the first\nhalf of the fourth century (Riedweg 2005, 123\u2013124). While there\nmay be some evidence that there were practicing Pythagoreans in the\nsecond half of the fourth century (see above section 3.5), it is hard\nto find anyone to whom to apply that label in the third and second\ncenturies, so that, from the perspective of the evidence available to\nus at present, Cicero may well be right that Nigidius was the first\nperson in several centuries to claim to follow Pythagorean practices.\nHowever, the sources for Nigidius are meager and there is no evidence\nthat he was the leader of a large and powerful group. If there was an\norganized group at all, it is more likely to have been a smaller\ncircle (Flinterman 2014, 344).\n\nIt is difficult to be sure in what Nigidius\u2019 Pythagoreanism\nconsisted. There is no mention of Pythagoras or Pythagoreans in the\nsurviving fragments of his work nor do they show him engaging in\nPythagorean style numerology as Varro did (Rawson 1985, 291 ff.). In\nJerome\u2019s chronicle, Nigidius is labeled as Pythagorean and\nmagus; the most likely suggestion, thus, is that his\nPythagoreanism consisted in occult and magical practices. Pliny treats\nNigidius alongside the Magi and also presents Pythagoras and\nDemocritus as having learned magical practices from the Magi.\nCicero describes Nigidius as investgating matters that nature had\nhidden and this may be a reference to such magical lore (Flinterman\n2014, 345). Nigidius\u2019 expertise as an astrologer (he is reported\nto have used astrology to predict Augustus\u2019 future greatness on\nthe day of his birth [Suetonius, Aug. 94.5]) may be another\nPythagorean connection; Propertius\u2019 reference (IV 1) to Archytas\nshows that Pythagorean work in astronomy was typically connected to\nastrology in first century Rome.\n\nWhat led Nigidius and Varro to resurrect purported Pythagorean cult\npractices? One important influence may have been the Greek scholar\nAlexander Polyhistor, who was born in Miletus but was captured by the\nRomans during the Mithridatic wars and brought to Rome as a slave and\nfreed by Sulla in 80 BCE. He taught in Rome in the 70s. It is an\nintriguing suggestion that Nigidius learned his Pythagoreanism from\nAlexander (Dillon 1977, 117; For critiques of this suggestion see\nFlinterman 2014, 349\u2013350 and Long 2013, 145). There is no\nevidence that Alexander himself followed Pythagorean practices, but he\nwrote a book On Pythagorean Symbols, which was presumably an\naccount of the Pythagorean acusmata (or symbola),\nwhich set out the taboos that governed many aspects of the Pythagorean\nway of life. In addition, in his Successions of the\nPhilosophers, he gave a summary of Pythagorean philosophy, which\nhe supposedly found in the Pythagorean Notes (See section 4.2\nabove) and which has been preserved by Diogenes Laertius (VIII\n25\u201335). The basic principles assigned to Pythagoras are those of\nthe Neopythagorean tradition that begins in the early Academy, i.e.,\nthe monad and the indefinite dyad. Since Alexander also assigns to the\nPythagoreans the doctrine that the elements change into one another,\nwe might suppose that Ovid also used Alexander directly or indirectly,\nsince he assigns a similar doctrine to Pythagoras in the\nMetamorphoses (XV 75 ff., Rawson 1985, 294).\n\nIt is necessary to look in a slightly different direction, in order to\nsee how magical practices came to be particularly associated with\nPythagoras and thus why Nigidius was called Pythagorean and\nmagus. In the first century, it was widely believed that\nPythagoras had studied with the Magi (Cicero, Fin. V 87),\ni.e. Persian priests/wise men. What Pythagoras was thought to have\nlearned from the Magi most of all were the magical properties of\nplants. Pliny the elder (23\u201379 CE) identifies Pythagoras and\nDemocritus as the experts on such magic and the Magi as their teachers\n(Nat. XXIV 156\u2013160). Pliny goes on to give a number of\nspecific examples from a book on plants ascribed to Pythagoras. This\nbook is universally regarded as spurious by modern scholars, and even\nPliny, who accepts its authenticity, reports that some people ascribe\nit to Cleemporus. We can date this treatise on plants to the first\nhalf of the second century or earlier, since Cato the elder\n(234\u2013149 BCE) appears to make use of it in his On\nAgriculture (157), when he discusses the medicinal virtues of a\nkind of cabbage, which was named after Pythagoras (brassica\nPythagorea).\n\nA clearer understanding of this pseudo-Pythagorean treatise on plants\nand a further indication of its date can be obtained by looking at the\nwork of Bolus of Mendes, an Egyptian educated in Greek (see Dickie\n2001, 117\u2013122, to whom the following treatment of Bolus is\nindebted). Bolus composed a work entitled Cheiromecta, which\nmeans \u201cthings worked by hand\u201d and may thus refer to\npotions made by grinding plants and other substances (Dickie 2001,\n119). Bolus discussed not just the magical properties of plants but\nalso those of stones and animals. Pliny regarded the\nCheiromecta as composed by Democritus on the basis of his\nstudies with the Magi (Nat. 24. 160) and normally cites its\ncontents as what Democritus or the Magi said. Columella, however,\ntells us what was really going on (On Agriculture VII 5.17).\nThe work was in fact composed by Bolus, who published it under the\nname of Democritus. Bolus thus appears to have made a collection of\nmagical recipes, some of which do seem to have connections to the\nMagi, since they are similar to recipes found in 8th century cuneiform\ntexts (Dickie 2001, 121). In order to gain authority for this\ncollection, he assigned it to the famous Democritus.\n\nSince Democritus was sometimes regarded as the pupil of Pythagoreans\n(Diogenes Laertius IX 38), Bolus\u2019 choice of Democritus to give\nauthority to his work may suggest that someone else (the Cleemporus\nmentioned by Pliny?) had already used Pythagoras for this purpose and\nthat the pseudo-Pythagorean treatise on the magical properties of\nplants was thus already in existence when Bolus wrote, in the first\nhalf of the second century BCE. An example of the type of recipe\ninvolved is Pliny\u2019s ascription to Democritus of the idea that\nthe tongue of a frog, cut out while the frog was still alive, if\nplaced above the heart of a sleeping woman, will cause her to give\ntrue answers (Nat. XXXII 49). Thus, the picture of Pythagoras\nthe magician, which may lie behind a number of the supposed\nPythagorean practices of Nigidius Figulus, is based on little more\nthan the tradition that Pythagoras had traveled to Egypt and the east,\nso that he became the authority figure, to whom the real collectors of\nmagical recipes in the third and second century BCE ascribed their\ncollections.\n\nNigidius\u2019 revival of supposed Pythagorean practices spread to\nother figures in first century Rome. Cicero attacked Vatinius, consul\nin 48 and a supporter of Caesar, for calling himself a Pythagorean and\ntrying to shield his scandalous practices under the name of Pythagoras\n(Vat. 6). The scandalous practices involved necromancy,\ninvoking the dead, by murdering young boys. Presumably this method of\nnecromancy would not be ascribed to Pythagoras, but the suggestion is\nthat some methods of consulting the dead were regarded as Pythagorean.\nCicero later ended up defending this same Vatinius in a speech which\nhas not survived but some of the contents of which we know from the\nancient scholia on the speech against Vatinius. In this speech Cicero\ndefended Vatinius\u2019 habit of wearing a black toga, which he\nattacked in the earlier speech (Vat. 12), as a harmless\naffectation of Pythagoreanism (Dickie 2001, 170). Thus, the title of\nPythagorean in first century Rome carried with it associations with\nmagical practices, not all of which would have been widely approved.\n\n\nAnother example of the connection between Pythagoreanism and magic and\nits possible negative connotations is Anaxilaus of Larissa (Rawson\n1985, 293; Dickie 2001, 172\u2013173). In his chronicle, Jerome\ndescribes him with the same words as he used for Nigidius, Pythagorean\nand magus, and reports that he was exiled from Rome in 28\nBCE. We know that Anaxilaus wrote a work entitled Paignia\n(\u201ctricks\u201d), which seems to have consisted of some rather\nbizarre conjuring tricks for parties. Pliny reports one of\nAnaxilaus\u2019 tricks as calling for burning the discharge from a\nmare in heat in a flame, in order to cause the guests to see images of\nhorses\u2019 heads (Nat. XXVIII 181). The passion for things\nPythagorean can also be seen in the figure of king Juba of Mauretania\n(ca. 46 BCE \u2013 23 CE), a learned and cultured man, educated at\nRome and author of many books. Olympiodorus describes him as \u201ca\nlover of Pythagorean compositions\u201d and suggests that Pythagorean\nbooks were forged to satisfy the passion of collectors such as Juba\n(Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca 12.1, p. 13).\n\nThe connection between Pythagoreanism and astrology visible in\nNigidius can perhaps also be seen in Thrasyllus of Alexandria (d. 36\nCE), the court astrologer and philosopher, whom the Roman emperor\nTiberius met in Rhodes and brought to Rome. Thrasyllus is famous for\nhis edition of Plato\u2019s dialogues arranged into tetralogies, but\nhe was a Platonist with strong Pythagorean leanings. Porphyry in his\nLife of Plotinus (20) quotes Longinus as saying that\nThrasyllus wrote on Platonic and Pythagorean first principles (Dillon\n1977, 184\u2013185). Most suggestive of all is the quotation from\nThrasyllus preserved by Diogenes Laertius (Diogenes Laertius IX 38),\nin which Thrasyllus calls Democritus a zealous follower of the\nPythagoreans and asserts that Democritus drew all his philosophy from\nPythagoras and would have been thought to have been his pupil, if\nchronology did not prevent it. It is impossible to be sure what\nThrasyllus had in mind here, but one very plausible suggestion is that\nhe is thinking of Democritus as a sage, who practiced magic, the\nDemocritus created by Bolus, who was the successor to the arch mage\nPythagoras, the supposed author of the treatise on the magical uses of\nplants (Dickie 2001, 195). Some have argued that the subterranean\nbasilica discovered near the Porta Maggiore and dating to the first\ncentury CE was the meeting place of a Pythagorean community but the\nevidence for this suggestion is very weak (Flinterman 2014).\n\nWe cannot be sure whether the Pythagoreanism of Nigidius, Varro and\ntheir successors was limited to such things as burial ritual, magical\npractices and black togas or whether it extended to less spectacular\nfeatures of a \u201cPythagorean\u201d life. Q. Sextius, however,\nfounded a philosophical movement in the time of Augustus, which\nprescribed a vegetarian diet and taught the doctrine of transmigration\nof souls, although Sextius presented himself as using different\narguments than Pythagoras for vegetarianism (Seneca, Ep. 108.\n17 ff.). One of these Sextians, as they were known, was Sotion, the\nteacher of Seneca, and it is Seneca who gives us most of the\ninformation we have about them. It is also noteworthy that Sextius is\nalso reported to have asked himself at the end of each day \u201cWhat\nbad habit have you cured today? What vice have you resisted? In what\nway are you better\u201d (Seneca, De Ira III 36). Cicero\ntells us that it was \u201cthe Pythagorean custom\u201d to call to\nmind in the evening everything said, heard or done during the day\n(Sen. 38, cf. Iamblichus, VP 164). The practice\ndescribed by Cicero is directed at training the memory in contrast to\nSextius\u2019 questions, which call for moral self-examination. On\nPythagoreanism in Rome see further Flinterman 2014.\n\nSomething similar to the Sextian version of the practice is found in\nlines 40\u201344 of the Golden Verses, a pseudepigraphical\ntreatise consisting of 71 Greek hexameter verses, which were ascribed\nto Pythagoras or the Pythagoreans. The poem is a combination of\nmaterials from different dates, and it is uncertain when it took the\nform preserved in manuscripts and called the Golden Verses;\ndates ranging from 350 BCE to 400 CE have been suggested (see Thom\n1995). It is not referred to by name until 200 CE. The Golden\nVerses are frequently quoted in the first centuries CE and thus\nconstitute one model of the Pythagorean life in Neopythagoreanism, one\nthat is free from magical practices. Much of the advice is common to\nall of Greek ethical thought (e.g., honoring the gods and parents;\nmastering lust and anger; deliberating before acting, following\nmeasure in all things), but there are also mentions of dietary\nrestrictions typical of early Pythagoreanism and the promise of\nleaving the body behind to join the aither as an immortal.\n\nOur most detailed account of a Neopythagorean living a life inspired\nby Pythagoras is Philostratus\u2019 Life of Apollonius of\nTyana. Apollonius was active in the second half of the first\ncentury CE and died in 97; Philostratus\u2019 life, which was written\nover a century later at the request of the empress Julia Domna and\ncompleted after her death in 217 CE, is more novel than sober\nbiography. According to Philostratus, Apollonius identified his wisdom\nas that of Pythagoras, who taught him the proper way to worship the\ngods, to wear linen rather than wool, to wear his hair long, and to\neat no animal food (I 32). Some have wondered if Apollonius\u2019\nPythagoreanism is largely the creation of Philostratus, but the\nstandard view has been that Apollonius wrote a life of Pythagoras used\nby Iamblichus (VP 254) and Porphyry (Burkert 1972, 100), and\nthe fragment of his treatise On Sacrifices has clear\nconnections to Neopythagorean philosophy (Kahn 2001, 143\u2013145).\nRohde thought that large parts of Apollonius\u2019s Life of\nPythagoras could be found in Iamblichus\u2019 On the\nPythagorean Life, but recently more and more doubt has arisen as\nto whether the Apollonius who wrote the Life of Pythagoras\nused by Iamblichus is really Apollonius of Tyana (Flinterman 2014,\n357). \n\nLike Pythagoras, Apollonius journeys to consult the wise men of the\neast and learns from the Brahmins in India that the doctrine of\ntransmigration, which Apollonius inherited from Pythagoras, originated\nin India and was handed on to the Egyptians from whom Pythagoras\nderived it (III 19). Philostratus (I 2) emphasizes that Apollonius was\nnot a magician, thus trying to free him from the more disreputable\nconnotations of Pythagorean practices associated with figures such as\nAnaxilaus and Vatinius (see above). Nonetheless, Philostratus\u2019\nlife does recount a number of Apollonius\u2019 miracles, such as the\nraising of a girl from the dead (IV 45). On Apollonius as a\nPythagorean see further Flinterman 2014.\n\nThese miracles made Apollonius into a pagan counterpart to Christ. The\nemperor Alexander Severus (222\u2013235 CE) worshipped Apollonius\nalongside Christ, Abraham and Orpheus (Hist. Aug., Vita Alex.\nSev. 29.2). Hierocles, the Roman governor of Bithynia, who was\nrigorous in his persecution of Christians, championed Apollonius at\nthe expense of Christ, in The Lover of Truth, and drew as a\nresponse Eusebius\u2019 Against Hierocles. As mentioned\nabove, there is some probability that Iamblichus intends to elevate\nPythagoras himself as a pagan counterpart to Christ in his On the\nPythagorean Life (Dillon and Hershbell 1991, 25\u201326).\n\nThe satirist Lucian (2nd CE) provides us with a hostile portrayal of\nanother holy man with Pythagorean connections, Alexander of\nAbnoteichus in Paphlagonia, who was active in the middle of the second\ncentury CE. In Alexander the False Prophet, Lucian reports\nthat Alexander compared himself to Pythagoras (4), could remember his\nprevious incarnations (34) and had a golden thigh like Pythagoras\n(40). Lucian shows the not often seen negative side to both\nPythagoras\u2019 and Alexander\u2019s reputations when he reports\nthat, if one took even the worst things said about Pythagoras,\nAlexander would far outdo him in wickedness (4). Some have seen\nAlexander as largely a literary construction by Lucian with little\nhistorical basis but other evidence confirms that there were traveling\nPythagorean wonder-workers in the early imperial period (Flinterman\n2014, 359). \n\nDespite these attacks on figures such as Apollonius and Alexander who\nmodeled themselves on Pythagoras, the Pythagorean way of life was in\ngeneral praised; the Neopythagorean tradition which portrays\nPythagoras as living the ideal life on which we should model our own\nreaches its culmination in Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean\nLife and Porphyry\u2019s Life of Pythagoras\n5. Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance\n\nThe influence of Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance was\nextensive and was found in most disciplines, in literature and art as\nwell as in philosophy and science. Here only the highlights of that\ninfluence can be given (see further Heninger 1974, Celenza 1999,\nCelenza 2001, Kahn 2001, Riedweg 2005, Hicks 2014 and Allen 2014, to\nall of whom the following account is indebted). It is crucial to\nrecognize from the beginning that the Pythagoras of the Middle Ages\nand Renaissance is the Pythagoras of the Neopythagorean tradition, in\nwhich he is regarded as either the most important or one of the most\nimportant philosophers in the Greek philosophical tradition. Thus,\nRalph Cudworth, in The True Intellectual System of the\nUniverse asserted that \u201cPythagoras was the most eminent of\nall the ancient Philosophers\u201d (1845, II 4). This is a far cry\nfrom the Pythagoras that can be reconstructed by responsible\nscholarship. Riedweg has put it well: \u201cHad Pythagoras and his\nteachings not been since the early Academy overwritten with\nPlato\u2019s philosophy, and had this \u2018palimpsest\u2019 not in\nthe course of the Roman empire achieved unchallenged authority among\nPlatonists, it would be scarcely conceivable that scholars from the\nMiddle Ages and modernity down to the present would have found the\npre-Socratic charismatic from Samos so fascinating\u201d (2005,\n128).\n5.1 Boethius/Nicomachus, Calcidius, Macrobius and the Middle Ages\n\nIn the Middle Ages Pythagoras and Pythagorean philosophy were regarded\nas the height of Greek philosophical achievement, although, somewhat\nparadoxically Pythagoreanism was not still an active philosophy as\nwere Platonism and Aristotelianism but instead belonged to an\n\u201cimagined history\u201d of philosophy (Hicks 2014, 420). The\nview of Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages was heavily determined by\nthree late ancient Latin writers: Calcidius, Macrobius and Boethius.\nIt was in particular the mathematical Pythagoreanism of Nicomachus as\ntransmitted by Boethius that determined the medieval picture of\nPythagoras. In ethics, Christians were able to embrace some\nPythagorean maxims such as the principle labeled Pythagorean by\nBoethius: \u201cFollow God\u201d (Consolation of Philosophy\n1.4). Some attention was also paid to other Pythagorean\nsymbola (see section 5.2 below). On the other hand the\ndoctrine of metempsychosis with its idea that human beings were born\nagain as animals was repugnant to Christian doctrine (John of\nSalisbury, Policraticus 7.10). When it comes to\nPythagoras\u2019 life it is crucial to recognize that\nIamblichus\u2019 and Porphyry\u2019s lives of Pythagoras were not\nknown in the Middle Ages so that Pythagoras\u2019 activities were\nmostly known through passages from classical authors and church\nfathers (Hicks 2014, 421). Pythagoras was included in medieval\nencyclopedic works and was given particularly thorough treatment by\nVincent of Beauvais (before 1200\u20131264) in his Speculum\nhistoriale (3.24\u201326), by John of Wales (fl.\n1260\u20131283) in Compendiloquium (3.6.2) and in The\nLives and Habits of the Philosophers ascribed to, but probably\nnot actually composed by, Walter Burley (1275\u20131344; see Riedweg\n2005, 129; Heninger 1974, 47; Hicks 2014, 421). \n\nThe most influential texts for the conception of Pythagoras in the\nLatin Middle Ages and early Renaissance were Boethius\u2019\n(480\u2013524 CE) De Institutione Arithmetica and De\nInstitutione Musica, which are virtually translations of the\nNeopythagorean Nicomachus\u2019 (second century CE) Introduction\nto Arithmetic and Introduction to Music (this larger\nwork is now lost, but a smaller Handbook of Harmonics\nsurvives). Boethius followed Nicomachus\u2019 classification of four\nmathematical sciences depending on the nature of their objects\n(arithmetic deals with multitude in itself, music with relative\nmultitude, geometry with unmoving magnitudes and astronomy with\nmagnitude in motion). Boethius introduced the term\nquadrivium, \u201cfourfold road\u201d to understanding, to\nrefer to these four sciences. In music theory, Boethius presents the\nPythagoreans as taking a middle position, which gives a role in\nharmonics to both reason and perception. His presentation of the\nPythagorean position was central to music theory for over a thousand\nyears (Hicks 2014, 424). Boethius recounts the apocryphal story of\nPythagoras\u2019 discovery in a blacksmith\u2019s shop of the ratios\nthat govern the concordant intervals (Mus. I 10). \n\nThe medieval picture of Pythagoras as a natural philosopher and the\nmedieval understanding of his theory of the nature of the soul were\nheavily influenced by the Latin commentary on Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus by Calcidius (4th century CE) and the Commentary\non the Dream of Scipio by Macrobius (5th century CE). Calcidius\nregarded Plato\u2019s Timaeus as a heavily Pythagorean\ndocument. Under the influence of the Neopythagorean Numenius,\nCalcidius assigned to Pythagoras the view that god was unity and\nmatter duality (Hicks 2014, 429). Calcidius describes Plato\u2019s\nWorld-Soul in a way that highlights its harmonic structure and\nMacrobius explicitly ascribes to Pythagoras the view that the soul is\na harmony (Commentary on the Dream of Scipio 1.14.19). The\ndoctrine of the harmony of the spheres, which portrays the cosmos as a\nharmony that is expressed in the music made by the revolutions of the\nplanets, follows from the numerical structure of the World-Soul and\nwas also assigned to Pythagoras by Calcidius. Most medieval\nNeoplatonic cosmoligies adopted the doctrine, but the reintroduction\nof Aristotle\u2019s criticism of it in the thirteenth century caused\nmany to abandon the theory until it was revived in the Renaissance by\nFicino (Hicks 2014, 434). Later, Shakespeare refers to the doctrine\nmemorably in The Merchant of Venice (V i. 54\u201365).\nCicero\u2019s presentation of it in the Dream of Scipio was\nalso influential in the Renaissance (Heninger 1974, 3).\n\nPythagorean influence also appeared at less elevated levels of\nmedieval culture. A fourteenth-century manual for preachers, which\ncontained lore about the natural world and is known as The Light\nof the Soul, ascribes a series of odd observations about nature\nto Archita Tharentinus, who is presumably intended to be the fourth\ncentury BCE Pythagorean, Archytas of Tarentum. These are mostly cited\nfrom a book, which was evidently forged in Archytas\u2019 name and\nknown as On Events in Nature. Some of the observations are\nplausible enough, e.g., that a person at the bottom of a well sees\nstars in the middle of the day, others more puzzling, e.g., that a\ndying man emits fiery rays from his eyes at death, while still others\nmay have connections to magic, e.g., \u201cif someone looks at a\nmirror, before which a white flower has been placed, he cries.\u201d\nSome magical lore ascribed to an Architas is also found in the\nthirteenth-century Marvels of the World (ps.-Albertus\nMagnus), e.g., \u201cif the wax of the left ear of a dog be taken and\nhung on people with periodic fever, it is beneficial\u2026\u201d\nThese texts seem to continue the connection between Pythagoreanism and\nmagic, which developed in the third and second centuries BCE, and is\nprominent in Rome during the first-century BCE (see above section\n4.5).\n5.2 The Renaissance: Ficino, Pico, Reuchlin, Copernicus and Kepler\n\nIn the Renaissance, Pythagoreanism played an important role in the\nthought of fifteenth- and sixteenth century Italian and German\nhumanists. The Florentine Marsilio Ficino (1433\u20131499) is most\nproperly described as a Neoplatonist. He made the philosophy of Plato\navailable to the Latin-speaking west through his translation of all of\nPlato into Latin. In addition he translated important works of writers\nin the Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean tradition, such as Plotinus,\nPorphyry, Iamblichus and Proclus. From that tradition he accepted and\ndeveloped the view that Plato was heir to an ancient\ntheology/philosophy (prisca theologia) that was derived from\nearlier sages including Pythagoras, who immediately preceded Plato in\nthe succession (Allen 2014, 435\u2013436). Ficino like the\nNeopythagoreans had no conception of an early and a late\nPythagoreanism, for him Pythagoreanism was a unity as indeed was the\nentire tradition of ancient theology (Celenza, 1999, 675\u2013681).\nFicino regarded works ascribed to the Chaldaean Zoroaster, the\nEgyptian Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus and Pythagoras, which modern\nscholarship has shown to be forgeries of late antiquity, as genuine\nworks on which Plato drew (Kristeller 1979, 131). Ficino provided a\ncomplete translation of the writings ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus\ninto Latin as well as translations of 39 of the short Pythagorean\nsayings known as symbola, many of which are ancient, and\nHierocles\u2019 commentary on the pseudo-Pythagorean Golden\nVerses (Heninger 1974, 63 and 66). The Golden Verses\n(see Thom 1995) were, in fact, one of the most popular Greek texts in\nthe Renaissance and were commonly used in textbooks for learning\nGreek; other pseudo-Pythagorean texts, such as the treatises ascribed\nto Timaeus of Locri and Ocellus, were translated early and regarded as\ngenuine texts on which Plato drew (Heninger 1974, 49, 55\u201356).\nFicino thought, moreover, that this whole pagan tradition could be\nreconciled with Christian and Jewish religion and accepted the view\nthat Pythagoras was born of a Jewish father (Heninger 1974, 201). For\nFicino and the Renaissance as a whole, Pythagoras was the most\nimportant of the Presocratic philosophers but he never overshadowed\nPlato, who was the highest authority, in part because there was no\nextensive body of texts by Pythagoras himself to compete with the\nPlatonic dialogues (Allen 2014, 453).\n\nFicino translated Iamblichus\u2019 four works on Pythagoreanism for\nhis own use and Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life had\nparticular influence on him. Ficino felt that in his time there was a\nneed for a divinely inspired guide on earth and fashioned himself as\nsuch a prophet under the influence of Iamblichus\u2019 presentation\nof Pythagoras as a divine guide sent by the gods to save mankind\n(Celenza 1999, 667\u2013674). The Pythagorean musical practice that\nhe found in Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life , with\nits emphasis on the impact of music on the soul, shaped his own music\nmaking and his presentation of himself as a Pythagorean and Orphic\nholy man (Allen 2014, 436\u2013440). Ficino and other Renaissance\nthinkers grappled with the challenge that the Pythagorean notion of\nmetempsychosis presented to Christiantiy and how it might be\nreconciled with Christian views (Allen 2014, 440\u2013446). Ficino\nwas eager to absolve Plato from such a heresy. He does this in part by\ntreating metempsychosis metaphorically as referring to the\nsoul\u2019s ability to remake itself, but he also emphasized that\nmetempsychosis was not present in Plato\u2019s latest work,\nLaws, and made the Pythagoreans scapegoats by suggesting that\nother passages in Plato refer not to Plato\u2019s own doctrines but\nthe Pythagoreans (Celenza 1999, 681\u2013691). Ficino saw his own\narithmology as Pythgorean and study of Neopythagorean mathematical\ntreatises by Nicomachus and Theon led Ficino to conclude that\nPlato\u2019s nuptial number in Book 8 of the Republic was 12\n(Allen 2014, 446\u2013450). He also mistakenly and paradoxically\nfollowed the Neopythagoreans in thinking that the Pythagoreans\noccupied the crucial position in the history of philosophy of the\nfirst philosophers to distinguish between the corporeal and\nincorporeal and to assert the superiority of the latter, an\nachievement that is more reasonably assigned to Ficino\u2019s hero\nPlato (Celenza 1999, 699\u2013706). \n\nThe Pythagorean symbola were important to Ficino and the\nRenaissance. They had already been interpreted as moral maxims by the\nearly church fathers (e.g., Clement, Origen and Ambrose). Ambrose, for\nexample, interpreted the Pythagorean \u201cdo not take the public\npath\u201d to mean that priests should live lives of exceptional\npurity (Ep. 81). Jerome discussed 13 symbola in his\nEpistle Against Rufinus and this list became the basis for\nmedieval discussions of the symbola in texts such as the\nSpeculum historiale of Vincent of Beauvais and the Lives\nand Habits of the Philosophers  of Walter Burley (Celenza 2001,\n11\u201312). Ficino particularly encountered them in\nIamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life and\nProtrepticus. For Ficino, their brevity was appropriate to\nrevealing the supreme reality, since he argued that the closer the\nmind approaches to the One the fewer words it needs (Allen 2014,\n450\u2013451). In addition, he found them relevant to the preparation\nand purification of the soul (Celenza, 1999, 693). They were widely\ndiscussed by Ficino\u2019s contemporaries and successors (Celenza\n2001, 52\u201381). Some figures wrote treatises devoted to their\ninterpretation (Ficino\u2019s mentor Antonio degli Agli, his follower\nGiovanni Nesi [for an edition of Nesi\u2019s work see Celenza 2001],\nFilippo Beroaldo the Elder and Lilio Gregorio Giraldi), while others\ndiscussed them as part of larger works (Erasmus and Reuchlin). Not\neveryone took the symbola seriously; Angelo Poliziano, the\ngreat Florentine philologist and professor, presents a satire on them\nin the fashion of Lucian, joking about Pythagoras\u2019 ability to\ntalk to animals and ridiculing the prohibition on beans (Celenza 2001,\n33).\n\nFicino\u2019s friend and younger contemporary, Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola (1463\u20131494), advanced an even more radical doctrine of\nuniversal truth, according to which all philosophies had a share of\ntruth and could be reconciled in a comprehensive philosophy\n(Kristeller 1979, 205). His Oration on the Dignity of Man\nshows the variety of ways in which he was influenced by the\nPythagorean tradition. He equates the friendship that the Pythagoreans\nsaw as the goal of philosophy (see, e.g., Iamblichus, VP 229)\nwith the peace that the angels announced to men of good will (1965,\n11\u201312); the Pythagorean symbola forbidding urinating\ntowards the sun or cutting the nails during sacrifice are interpreted\nallegorically as calling on us to relieve ourselves of excessive\nappetite for sensual pleasures and to trim the pricks of anger (1965,\n15); the practice of philosophizing through numbers is assigned to\nPythagoras along with Philolaus, Plato and the early Platonists (1965,\n25\u201326); Pythagoras is said to have modeled his philosophy on the\nOrphic theology (1965, 33). Finally, on the basis of the\npseudo-Pythagorean letter of Lysis to Hipparchus, Pythagoras is said\nto have kept silent about his doctrine and left just a few things in\nwriting to his daughter at his death. In observing such silence,\nPythagoras is portrayed as following an earlier practice symbolized by\nthe sphinx in Egypt and most of all by Moses, who indeed published the\nlaw to men but supposedly kept the interpretation of that law a\nsecret. Pico equates this secret interpretation of the law with the\nCabala, an esoteric doctrine in which the words and numbers of Hebrew\nscripture are interpreted according to a mystical system (1965, 30;\nsee also Heptaplus 1965, 68).\n\nPico\u2019s interest in reconciling the Cabala with Christianity and\nthe pagan philosophical tradition, including Pythagoreanism, was\nfurther developed by the German humanist, Johannes Reuchlin\n(1445\u20131522). In the dedicatory letter for his Three\nBooks On the Art of the Cabala (1517), which was\naddressed to Pope Leo X, Reuchlin says that as Ficino has restored\nPlato for Italy so he will \u201coffer to the Germans Pythagoras\nreborn,\u201d although he cannot \u201cdo this without the cabala of\nthe Hebrews, because the philosophy of Pythagoras took its beginning\nfrom the precepts of the cabalists\u201d (tr. Heninger 1974, 245).\nThus, in an earlier work (De verbo mirifico) he had equated\nthe four consonants in the Hebrew name for God, JHVH, with the\nPythagorean tetraktys, and gave to each of the letters, which\nare equated with numbers as in Greek practice, a mystical meaning. The\nfirst H, which also stands for the number five that the Pythagoreans\nequated with marriage, is thus taken to symbolize the marriage of the\ntrinity with material nature, which was equated with the dyad by the\nNeopythagoreans (Riedweg 2005, 130).\n\nAt the level of popular culture, several fortune-telling devices were\ntied to Pythagoras, the most famous of which went under the name of\nthe Wheel of Pythagoras (Heninger 1974, 237). Pythagoras was probably\nmost widely known, however, through Ovid\u2019s presentation of him\nat the beginning of Book XV of the Metamorphoses, which was\nimmensely popular in the Renaissance (Heninger 1974, 50). Ovid\nrecounts the story, which had already been recognized as apocryphal by\nCicero (Tusc. IV 1), that the second Roman king, Numa,\nstudied with Pythagoras. Pythagoras is presented inaccurately by Ovid\nas a great natural philosopher, who discovered the secrets of the\nuniverse and who believed in a doctrine of the flux of four elements.\nOn the other hand, Ovid\u2019s emphasis on the prohibition on eating\nanimal flesh and on the immortality of the soul have some connection\nto the historical Pythagoras. In the Renaissance, Pythagoras was not\nprimarily known for the \u201cPythagorean Theorem,\u201d as he is\ntoday. Better known was the doubtful anecdote (Burkert 1960, Riedweg\n2005, 90\u201397), going back ultimately to Heraclides of Pontus but\nknown to the Renaissance mainly through Cicero (Tusc. V\n3\u20134), that he was the first to coin the word\n\u201cphilosopher\u201d (Heninger 1974, 29).\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Pythagorean influence was particularly\nimportant in the development of astronomy. The Polish astronomer\nCopernicus (1473\u20131543), in the Preface and Dedication to\nPope Paul III attached to his epoch making work, On the\nRevolution of the Heavenly Spheres, reports that, in his\ndissatisfaction with the commonly accepted geocentric astronomical\nsystem of Ptolemy (2nd century CE), he laboriously reread the works of\nall the philosophers to see if any had ever proposed a different\nsystem. This labor led him to find inspiration not from Pythagoras\nhimself but rather from later Pythagoreans and in particular from\nPhilolaus. Copernicus found in Cicero (Ac. II 39. 123) that\nthe Pythagorean Hicetas (4th century BCE \u2014 Copernicus mistakenly\ncalls him Nicetas) had proposed that the earth revolved around its\naxis at the center of the universe and in pseudo-Plutarch (Diels 1958,\n378) that another Pythagorean, Ecphantus, and Heraclides of Pontus\n(both 4th century BCE), whom Copernicus regarded as a Pythagorean, had\nproposed a similar view. More importantly, he also found in\npseudo-Plutarch that the Pythagorean, Philolaus of Croton (5th century\nBCE), \u201cheld that the earth moved in a circle \u2026 and was\none of the planets\u201d (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly\nSpheres 1. 5, tr. Wallis).\n\nCopernicus reports to the Pope that he was led by these earlier\nthinkers \u201cto meditate on the mobility of the earth.\u201d\nPythagorean influence on Copernicus was not limited to the notion of a\nmoving earth. In the same preface he explains his hesitation to\npublish his book in light of the pseudo-Pythagorean letter of Lysis to\nHipparchus, which recounts the supposed reluctance of the Pythagoreans\nto divulge their views to the common run of people, who had not\ndevoted themselves to study (for further Pythagorean influences on\nCopernicus see Kahn 2001, 159\u2013161). A number of the followers of\nCopernicus saw him as primarily reviving the ancient Pythagorean\nsystem rather than presenting anything new (Heninger 1974, 130 and\n144, n. 131); Edward Sherburne reflects the common view of the late\n17th century in referring to the heliocentric system as \u201cthe\nsystem of Philolaus and Copernicus\u201d (Heninger 1974,\n129\u2013130), although in the Philolaic system it is, in fact, a\ncentral fire and not the sun that is at the center of the\nuniverse.\n\nThe last great Pythagorean was Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630\n\u2014 see Kahn 2001, 161\u2013172 for a good brief account of\nKepler\u2019s Pythagoreanism). Kepler began by developing the\nCopernican system in light of the five regular solids (tetrahedron,\ncube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron), to which Plato\nappealed in his construction of matter in the Timaeus (see\nespecially 53B-55C). He followed the Renaissance practice illustrated\nabove of regarding Greek philosophy as closely connected to the wisdom\nof the Near East, when he asserted that the Timaeus was a\ncommentary on the first chapter of Genesis (Kahn 2001, 162).\nIn the preface to his early work, Mysterium Cosmographicum\n(1596), Kepler says that his purpose is to show that God used the five\nregular bodies, \u201cwhich have been most celebrated from the time\nof Pythagoras and Plato,\u201d as his model in constructing the\nuniverse and that \u201che accommodated the number of heavenly\nspheres, their proportions, and the system of their motions\u201d to\nthese five regular solids (tr. Heninger 1974, 110\u2013111).\n\nIn ascribing geometrical knowledge of the five regular solids to\nPythagoras, Kepler is following an erroneous Neopythagorean tradition,\nalthough the dodecahedron may have served as an early Pythagorean\nsymbol (see on Hippasus in section 3.4 above and Burkert 1972,\n70\u201371, 404, 460). Thus, this aspect of Kepler\u2019s work is\nmore Platonic than Pythagorean. The five solids were conceived of as\ncircumscribing and inscribed in the spheres of the orbits of the\nplanets, so that the five solids corresponded to the six planets known\nto Kepler (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury). There were\nsix planets, because there were precisely five regular bodies to be\nused in constructing the universe, corresponding to the five intervals\nbetween the planets. This view was overthrown by the later discovery\nof Uranus as a seventh planet. Kepler\u2019s cosmology was, however,\nfar from a purely a priori exercise. Whereas his\ncontemporary, Robert Fludd, developed a cosmology structured by\nmusical numbers, which could in no way be confirmed by observation,\nKepler strove to make his system consistent with precise observations.\nKahn suggests that we here see again the split \u201cbetween a\nrational and an obscurantist version of Pythagorean thought,\u201d\nwhich is similar to the ancient split in the school between\nmathematici and acusmatici (2001, 163).\n\nClose work with observational data collected by Tycho Brahe led Kepler\nto abandon the universal ancient view that the orbits of the planets\nwere circular and to recognize their elliptical nature. More clearly\nPythagorean is Kepler\u2019s consistent belief that the data show\nthat the motions of the planets correspond in various ways to the\nratios governing the musical concords (see Dreyer 1953,\n405\u2013410), so that there is a heavenly music, a doctrine attested\nfor Philolaus and Archytas, which probably goes back to Pythagoras as\nwell. For Kepler, however, the music produced by the heavenly motions\nwas \u201cperceived by reason, and not expressed in sound\u201d\n(Harmonice Mundi V 7). In his attempt to make the numbers of\nthe heavenly music work, he joked that he would appeal to the shade of\nPythagoras for aid, \u201cunless the soul of Pythagoras has migrated\ninto mine\u201d (Koestler 1959, 277).\n\nKepler has been described \u201cas the last exponent of a form of\nmathematical cosmology that can be traced back to the shadowy figure\nof Pythagoras\u201d (Field 1988, 170). It is true that Kepler\u2019s\nwork led the way to Newton\u2019s mechanics, which cannot be\ndescribed in terms of ancient geometry and number theory but relies on\nthe calculus and which relies on a theory of physical forces that is\nalien to ancient thought. On the other hand, many modern scientists\naccept the basic tenet that knowledge of the natural world is to be\nexpressed in mathematical formulae, which is rightly regarded as a\ncentral Pythagorean thesis, since it was first rigorously formulated\nby the Pythagoreans Philolaus ( Fr. 4) and Archytas and may, in a\nrudimentary form, go back to Pythagoras himself.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aelian, 1997, <em>Historical Miscellany</em>, N.
