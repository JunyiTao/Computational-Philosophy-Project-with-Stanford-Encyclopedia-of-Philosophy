    "main_text": "Exemplification and exhaustive interpretations\n8. Exemplification and exhaustive interpretations\n\nMinimal interpretations of sentences are a common phenomenon and are\nnot only found in the antecedents of donkey sentences. Among the most\nwidely discussed cases are exhaustive answers to questions, or more\ngenerally, exhaustive interpretations (Groenendijk & Stokhof 1984,\nBonomi & Casalegno 1993, Sevi 2005, Schulz and van Rooij 2006,\nSpector 2006, Fox 2007, Fox & Hackl 2006; see also the entry\n implicature).\n Here is an illustration.\n\n(53)\n\n\n\nJosephine:  \nWho caught anything? \n\nBeatrice:\nJason and Willie did.\n\n\n\nWe tend to understand Beatrice\u2019s answer as suggesting that Jason\nand Willie were the only ones who caught something. This is the\nexhaustive interpretation of Beatrice\u2019s answer. Non-exhaustive\nor \u201cmention some\u201d answers are often marked with special\nintonation or particles, as in (54), for example:\n\n(54)\n\n\n\nJosephine:  \nWho caught anything? \n\nBeatrice:\nJason and Willie did for sure. \n\n\n\nIn this case, Beatrice indicates that she does not mean her answer to\nbe understood exhaustively. In combination with Groenendijk and\nStokhof\u2019s 1984 analysis of questions, the exemplification\nrelation allows a strikingly simple characterization of exhaustive and\nnon-exhaustive answers. If we import Groenendijk and Stokhof\u2019s\nanalysis into a situation semantics, the extension of\nJosephine\u2019s question in (54) is the proposition in (55):\n\n(55)\n\u03bbs [\u03bbx \u2203y\ncaught(y)(x)(s) = \u03bbx\n\u2203y\ncaught(y)(x)(w0)]\n\n\n(55) describes possible situations in which the set of those who\ncaught something is the same as the set of those who caught something\nin the actual world. Since question extensions are propositions, they\ncan be exemplified. Suppose Jason, Willie, and Joseph are the only\nones who caught anything in the actual world. Then (55) is exemplified\nby all minimal situations in which Jason, Willie, and Joseph caught\nsomething. If nobody caught anything in the actual world, then any\nactual situation exemplifies (55). Bringing in the Austinian\nperspective, we can now say that answers to questions are always\nunderstood as claims about the actual situations that exemplify the\nquestion extension. Via their exemplifying situations, then, question\nextensions determine possibly multiple topic situations that answers\nare understood to make claims about. When an answer is interpreted as\nexhaustive, the proposition it expresses is understood as\nexemplified by the topic situations. When an answer is\ninterpreted as non-exhaustive, the proposition it expresses is\nunderstood as being merely true in the topic situations. We\nhave, then:\n\n(56)\n\n\n\nQuestion extension\nA proposition. The set of situations that answer the question in\nthe same way as the actual world does. \n\nAustinian topic situations  \nAll actual situations that exemplify the question\nextension. \n\nExhaustive answers\nPropositional answers that are understood as exemplified by the\ntopic situations. \n\nNon-exhaustive answers\nPropositional answers that are understood as true in the topic\nsituations. \n \n\n\nThe proposition expressed by Beatrice\u2019s exhaustive answer in\n(53) is understood as exemplified by the topic situations determined\nby Josephine\u2019s question, and that implies that Jason and Willie\nwere the only ones who caught anything. In contrast, Beatrice\u2019s\nnon-exhaustive answer in (54) is understood as being true in the topic\nsituations, and that allows for the possibility that there were others\nwho caught something.\n\nIt might be useful to consider a few more possible answers that\nBeatrice might have given in response to Josephine\u2019s question\nand find out what the exemplification approach would predict if the\nanswers are understood exhaustively:\n\n(57)\n\n\na.\nTwo cats did.\nb.\nBetween two and five cats did.\nc.\nNobody did.\n \n\n\nThe proposition expressed by 57(a) is exemplified by minimal\nsituations in which two cats caught something. If the topic situations\nare of this kind, they, too, are minimal situations in which two cats\ncaught something. But then the only ones who caught anything in the\nactual world are two cats. Building in maximalization, the proposition\nexpressed by 57(b) is exemplified by minimal situations in which a\nbunch of two to five cats that consisted of all the cats that caught\nsomething in some salient resource situation caught something. If the\ntopic situations are of this kind, then only cats caught something,\nand there were between two and five of them. For 57(c), the set of\nsituations that exemplify the proposition it expresses coincides with\nthe set of situations in which it is true. Consequently, there is no\ndifference between an exhaustive and a non-exhaustive interpretation.\nThe topic situations include the actual world, and what is being\nclaimed about them is that nobody caught anything.\n\nThe examples discussed suggest that the notion of minimality that is\nneeded for the analysis of donkey conditionals also accounts for\nexhaustive interpretations of answers. A third area where what looks\nlike the same notion of minimality shows up is Davidsonian event\npredication.\n",
