Arrow\u2019s Framework\nThe problem of finding an aggregation procedure arises, as Arrow\nframed it, in connection with some given alternatives between which\nthere is a choice is to be made. The nature of these alternatives\ndepends on the kind of choice problem that is being studied. In the\ntheory of elections, the alternatives are people who might stand as\ncandidates in an election. In welfare economics they are different\nstates of a society, such as distributions of income and labour\nrequirements. The alternatives conventionally are referred to using\nlower case letters from the end of the alphabet\nas \\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\); the set of all\nthese alternatives is \\(X\\). The people whose tastes and values\nwill inform the choice are assumed to be finite in number, and they\nare enumerated \\(1, \\ldots, n\\).\nArrow\u2019s problem arises, then, only after some alternatives\nand people have been fixed. It is for them that an aggregation\nprocedure is sought. Crucially, though, this problem\narises before relevant information about the people\u2019s\npreferences among the alternatives has been gathered, whether that is\nby polling or some other method for eliciting or determining\npreferences. The question that Arrow\u2019s theorem answers is, more\nprecisely, this: Which procedures are there for arriving at a social\nordering of some given alternatives, on the basis of some given\npeople\u2019s preferences among them, no matter what these preferences turn\nout to be?\nIn practice, meanwhile, we sometimes must select a procedure for\nmaking social decisions without knowing for which alternatives and\npeople it will be used. In recurring elections for some public office,\nfor instance, there is a different slate of candidates each time, and\na different population of voters, and we must use the same voting\nmethod to determine the winner, no matter who the candidates and\nvoters are and no matter how many of them there happen to be. Such\nprocedures are not directly available for study within Arrow\u2019s\nframework, with its fixed set \\(X\\) of alternatives and people\n\\(1, \\ldots, n\\). Arrow\u2019s theorem is still relevant to them,\nthough. It tells us that even when the alternatives and\npeople are held fixed, then still there is no \u201cgood\u201d\nmethod for deriving social orderings. Now, if there is no good method\nfor voting even once, with the particular candidates and voters who\nare involved on that occasion, then nor, presumably, is there a good\nmethod that can be used repeatedly, with different candidates and\nvoters each time.\n",
