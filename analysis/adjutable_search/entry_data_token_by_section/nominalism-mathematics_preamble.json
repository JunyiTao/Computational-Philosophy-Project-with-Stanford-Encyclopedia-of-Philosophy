    "main_text": "\n\nNominalism about mathematics (or mathematical nominalism) is the view\naccording to which either mathematical objects, relations, and\nstructures do not exist at all, or they do not exist as abstract\nobjects (they are neither located in space-time nor do they have\ncausal powers). In the latter case, some suitable concrete replacement\nfor mathematical objects is provided. Broadly speaking, there are two\nforms of mathematical nominalism: those views that require the\nreformulation of mathematical (or scientific) theories in order to\navoid the commitment to mathematical objects (e.g., Field 1980;\nHellman 1989), and those views that do not reformulate mathematical or\nscientific theories and offer instead an account of how no commitment\nto mathematical objects is involved when these theories are used\n(e.g., Azzouni 2004). Both forms of nominalism are examined, and they\nare assessed in light of how they address five central problems in the\nphilosophy of mathematics (namely, problems dealing with the\nepistemology, the ontology, and the application of mathematics as well\nas the use of a uniform semantics and the proviso that mathematical\nand scientific theories be taken literally).\n",
