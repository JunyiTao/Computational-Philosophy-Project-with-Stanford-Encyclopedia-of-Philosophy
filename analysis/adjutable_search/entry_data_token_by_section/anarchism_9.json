    "main_text": "Anarchism in Political Philosophy || Contingent, Consequentialist, and a posteriori Anarchism\n2.3 Contingent, Consequentialist, and a posteriori Anarchism\n\nA less stringent form of anarchism will argue that states could be\njustified in theory\u2014even though, in practice, no state or very\nfew states are actually legitimate. Contingent anarchism will hold\nthat states in the present configuration of things fail to live up to\nthe standards of their own justification. This is an a\nposteriori argument (see Simmons 2001) based both in a\ntheoretical account of the justification of the state (for example,\nthe social contract theory of liberal-democratic theory) and in an\nempirical account of how and why concrete states fail to be justified\nbased upon this theory. The author of the present article has offered\na version of this argument based upon the social contract theory,\nholding that the liberal-democratic social contract theory provides\nthe best theory of the justification of the state, while arguing that\nvery few states actually live up to the promise of the social contract\ntheory (Fiala 2013a).\n\nOne version of the contingent anarchist argument focuses on the\nquestion of the burden of proof for accounts that would justify\npolitical authority. This approach has been articulated by Noam\nChomsky, who explains:\n\n\n[This] is what I have always understood to be the essence of\nanarchism: the conviction that the burden of proof has to be placed on\nauthority, and that it should be dismantled if that burden cannot be\nmet. Sometimes the burden can be met. (Chomsky 2005: 178)\n\n\nChomsky accepts legitimate authority based in ordinary experience: for\nexample, when a grandfather prevents a child from darting out into the\nstreet. But state authority is a much more complicated affair.\nPolitical relationships are attenuated; there is the likelihood of\ncorruption and self-interest infecting political reality; there are\nlevels and degrees of mediation, which alienate us from the source of\npolitical authority; and the rational autonomy of adults is important\nand fundamental. By focusing on the burden of proof, Chomsky\nacknowledges that there may be ways to meet the burden of proof for\nthe justification of the state. But he points out that there is a\nprima facie argument against the state\u2014which is based in a\ncomplex historical and empirical account of the role of power,\neconomics, and historical inertia in creating political institutions.\nHe explains:\n\n\nSuch institutions face a heavy burden of proof: it must be shown that\nunder existing conditions, perhaps because of some overriding\nconsideration of deprivation or threat, some form of authority,\nhierarchy, and domination is justified, despite the prima facie case\nagainst it\u2014a burden that can rarely be met. (Chomsky 2005:\n174)\n\n\nChomsky does not deny that the burden of proof could be met. Rather,\nhis point is that there is a prima facie case against the state, since\nthe burden of proof for the justification of the state is rarely\nmet.\n\nContingent anarchism is based in consequentialist reasoning, focused\non details of historical actuality. Consequentialist anarchism will\nappeal to utilitarian considerations, arguing that states generally\nfail to deliver in terms of promoting the happiness of the greater\nnumber of people\u2014and more strongly that state power tends to\nproduce unhappiness. The actuality of inequality, classism, elitism,\nracism, sexism, and other forms of oppression can be used to support\nan anarchist argument, holding that even though a few people benefit\nfrom state power, a larger majority suffers under it.\n\nThere is a significant difference between anarchism that is offered in\npursuit of utilitarianism\u2019s greater happiness ideal and\nanarchism that is offered in defense of the minority against the\ntyranny of the majority. As we shall see in the next section,\nindividualist anarchists are primarily concerned with the tendency of\nutilitarian politics to sacrifice the rights of individuals in the\nname of the greater good.\n\nBefore turning to that conception of anarchism, let\u2019s note two\nclassical authors who offer insight into utilitarian anarchism. Godwin\narticulated a form of anarchism that is connected to a utilitarian\nconcern. Godwin\u2019s general moral thought is utilitarian in basic\nconception, even though he also argues based upon fundamental\nprinciples such as the importance of liberty. But Godwin\u2019s\narguments are a posteriori, based upon generalizations from\nhistory and with an eye toward the future development of happiness and\nliberty. He writes:\n\n\nAbove all we should not forget, that government is an evil, an\nusurpation upon the private judgment and individual conscience of\nmankind; and that, however we may be obliged to admit it as a\nnecessary evil for the present. (Godwin 1793: bk V, ch. I, p. 380)\n\n\nThis claim is similar to Chomsky\u2019s insofar as it recognizes the\ncomplicated nature of the historical dialectic. The goal of political\ndevelopment should be in a direction that goes beyond the state (and\ntoward the development of individual reason and morality). But in our\npresent condition, some form of government may be \u201ca necessary\nevil\u201d, which we ought to strive to overcome. The point here is\nthat our judgments about the justification of the state are\ncontingent: they depend upon present circumstances and our current\nform of development. And while states may be necessary features of the\ncurrent human world, as human beings develop further, it is possible\nthat the state might outlive its usefulness.\n\nWe should note that utilitarian arguments are often used to support\nstate structures in the name of the greater good. Utilitarian\nanarchists will argue that states fail to do this. But utilitarian\nconclusions are not usually based upon a fundamental appeal to moral\nprinciples such as liberty or the rights of the individual. Thus\nBentham described claims about human rights as \u201canarchical\nfallacies\u201d because they tended to lead toward anarchy, which he\nrejected. Bentham described the difference between a moderate\nutilitarian effort at reform and the anarchist\u2019s revolutionary\ndoctrine of human rights, saying that\n\n\nthe anarchist setting up his will and fancy for a law before which all\nmankind are called upon to bow down at the first word\u2014the\nanarchist, trampling on truth and decency, denies the validity of the\nlaw in question,\u2014denies the existence of it in the character of\na law, and calls upon all mankind to rise up in a mass, and resist the\nexecution of it. (Bentham 1843: 498)\n\n\nMore principled deontological anarchism will maintain that states\nviolate fundamental rights and so are not justified. But utilitarian\nanarchism will not primarily be worried about the violation of a few\npeople\u2019s rights (although that is obviously a relevant\nconsideration). Rather, the complaint for a utilitarian anarchist is\nthat state structures tend to produce disadvantages for the greater\nnumber of people. Furthermore what Oren Ben-Dor calls\n\u201cutilitarian-based anarchism\u201d is based upon the idea that\nthere is no a priori justification of the state (Ben-Dor\n2000: 101\u20132). For the utilitarian, this all depends upon the\ncircumstances and conditions. Ben-Dor calls this anarchism because it\nrejects any a priori notion of state justification. In other\nwords, the utilitarian anarchist does not presume that states are\njustifiable; rather a utilitarian anarchist will hold that the burden\nof proof rests upon the defender of states to show that state\nauthority is justifiable on utilitarian grounds, by bringing in\nhistorical and empirical data about human nature, human flourishing,\nand successful social organization.\n",
