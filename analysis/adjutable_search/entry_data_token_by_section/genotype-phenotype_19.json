In this spirit, the ascendance of the\npredominant current meaning\u2014DNA versus traits\u2014has not\nnecessitated rejection or even disambiguation of the other meanings of\nthe terms evident in Johannsen (1911) and that have coexisted\nsince\u2014class, abstraction, or material constituents; whole or\npart; natural units or products of experimental control\n (sections 1\u20133).\n Not being troubled by the ambiguity of different meanings and methods\nis especially evident when commentators speak of \u201cthe\nnature-nurture debate\u201d as if it were unimportant to specify\nwhich nature-nurture science is being debated. In practice, at least\nfive nature-nurture sciences can be readily distinguished (Taylor\n2015):\n\n Researchers in laboratory and agricultural breeding or human\nquantitative geneticists compare how much variation in a trait is\nassociated with differences among means for varieties, locations,\nvariety-location combinations, and residual contributions (i.e.,\ngenotypic, environmental, genotype-environment interaction, and\nresidual variance where genotype here means a line or genealogically\ndefined group; see\n section 3.3)\n Researchers compare how much variation in a trait is associated\nwith differences in measured genetic factors, environmental factors,\ngene-environment interaction, and a residual component (where the\ngenetic factors are typically genotypes in the sense of a pair of\ngenes).\n Through either of the above forms of analysis, researchers try to\ncompare the variation within groups (e.g., among Euro-Americans and\namong African-Americans) to the difference between the averages for\nthe groups.\n Through investigations that might extend any of the preceding\nkinds of analysis of observational data, researchers piece together a\npicture of the processes of development of a trait and, on that basis,\nspeak to the fixity versus flexibility of traits. (The multiple\nmeanings of genotype, summarized above, arise in research and\ndiscussions on this topic.)\n Researchers provide an evolutionary account of the increase in\nfrequency of a trait through natural selection based on the\ntrait\u2019s superior function in the environment (see\n section 6.2).\n\n\nThese nature-nurture sciences entail not only different methods but\nalso different control of materials and conditions, so, in practice,\nresults are difficult to translate from one of them to the next.\nDiscussion of the nature-nurture debate (even in critical\naccounts where nature and nurture are said to interact or shape each\nother) signifies, among other things, that the specialness of the\nconditions involved in the original formulation and demonstration of\nthe genotype-phenotype distinction may be overlooked. As a\nconsequence, for example, control of materials and conditions that is\npractical in laboratory and agricultural breeding gets built into\nevolutionary thinking when the latter uses models and terms from\nbreeding as if there were also a selector in naturally variable\npopulations. \n\nGranted, as noted earlier, biotechnology has a growing capacity to\ncontrol conditions and harness genetically engineered organisms to\nproduce desired products. However, to the extent that biological\ntheory is still meant to address naturally variable populations, then\nconcepts, methods, and models are needed through which what has been\ncontrolled or de-emphasized might be brought back and\nre-integrated into the scientific accounts. The framing of\nthis entry in terms of control and reintegration has been designed to\ndraw attention to the space around the genotype-phenotype distinction\nthat remains open for conceptual clarification and methodological\nadvances.\n",
