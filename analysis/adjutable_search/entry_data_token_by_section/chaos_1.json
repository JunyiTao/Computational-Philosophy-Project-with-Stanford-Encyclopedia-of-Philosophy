    "main_text": "Defining Chaos: Determinism, Nonlinearity and Sensitive Dependence || A Brief History of Chaos\n1.1 A Brief History of Chaos\n Arguably, one can say that Aristotle was already aware of\nsomething similar to what we now call sensitive dependence. Writing\nabout methodology and epistemology, he observed that \u201cthe least\ninitial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a\nthousandfold\u201d (Aristotle OTH, 271b8). Nevertheless, thinking\nabout how small disturbances might grow explosively to produce\nsubstantial effects on a physical system\u2019s behavior became a\nphenomenon of ever intensifying investigation beginning with a famous\npaper by Edward Lorenz (1963.) He noted that a particular\nmeteorological model could exhibit exquisitely sensitive dependence on\nsmall changes in initial conditions. French mathematician Jacques\nHadamard had already developed the framework for partial differential\nequations exhibiting both continuous and discontinuous dependence on\ninitial conditions by 1922. Any equations exhibiting sensitive but\ncontinuous dependence are well-posed problems under his framework;\nhowever, he raised the possibility that any solution to equations for\na physical system exhibiting such sensitive dependence could indicate\nthat the target system obeyed no laws (Hadamard 1922, p. 38). Lorenz\u2019s\npioneering work demonstrated that such sensitive dependence was not a\nmatter of mathematical misdescription; rather, there was something\ninteresting in the mathematical model exhibiting chaos. Moreover,\nLorenz\u2019s and subsequent work indicated that there seemed to be no\nissue of the law-likeness of target systems whose models exhibited\nsensitive dependence. \n\nThough some other scientists and mathematicians prior to Lorenz had\nexamined such phenomena, these were basically isolated investigations\nnever producing a recognizable, sustained field of inquiry as happened\nafter the publication of Lorenz\u2019s seminal paper. Sensitive dependence\non initial conditions (SDIC) for some systems had already been\nidentified by James Clerk Maxwell (1876, p.\u00a013). He described\nsuch phenomena as being cases where the \u201cphysical axiom\u201d\nthat from like antecedents flow like consequences is violated. Like\nothers Maxwell recognized this kind of behavior could be found in\nsystems with a sufficiently large number of variables (possessing a\nsufficient level of complexity in this numerical sense). But he also\nargued that such sensitive dependence could happen the case of two\nspheres colliding (1860). Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1913), on the other\nhand, later recognized that this same kind of behavior could be\nrealized in systems with a small number of variables (simple systems\nexhibiting very complicated behavior). Pierre Duhem, relying on work\nby Hadamard and Poincar\u00e9, further articulated the practical\nconsequences of SDIC for the scientist interested in deducing\nmathematically precise consequences from mathematical models (1982,\npp.\u00a0138\u2013142).\n\n\n\n Poincar\u00e9 discussed examples that, in hindsight, we can view as\nraising doubts about taking explosive growth of small effects to be a\nsufficient condition for defining chaos. First, consider a perfectly\nsymmetric cone precisely balanced on its tip with only the force of\ngravity acting on it. In the absence of any impressed forces, the cone\nwould maintain this unstable equilibrium forever. It is unstable\nbecause the smallest nudge, from an air molecule, say, will cause the cone to\ntip over, but it could tip over in any direction due to the slight\ndifferences in various perturbations arising from suffering different\ncollisions with different molecules. Here, variations in the slightest\ncauses issue forth in dramatically different effects (a violation of\nMaxwell\u2019s physical axiom). If we were to plot the tipping over\nof the unstable cone, we would see that from a small ball of starting\nconditions, a number of different trajectories issuing forth from this\nball would quickly diverge from each other. \n\n\nThe concept of nearby trajectories diverging or growing away from each\nother plays an important role in discussions of chaos. Three useful\nbenchmarks for characterizing trajectory divergence are linear,\nexponential and geometric growth rates. Linear growth can be\nrepresented by the simple expression \\(y = ax+b\\), where \\(a\\) is an\narbitrary positive constant and \\(b\\) is an arbitrary constant. A\nspecial case of linear growth is illustrated by stacking pennies on a\ncheckerboard \\((a = 1\\), \\(b = 0)\\). If we use the rule of placing one\npenny on the first square, two pennies on the second square, three\npennies on the third square, and so forth, we will end up with 64\npennies stacked on the last square. The total number of pennies on the\ncheckerboard will be 2080. Exponential growth can be\nrepresented by the expression \\(y = n_{0}e^{ax}\\), where \\(n_{0}\\) is\nsome initial quantity (say the initial number of pennies to be\nstacked) and \\(a\\) is an arbitrary positive constant. \\((n_{0}\\) is\ncalled \u2018initial\u2019 because when \\(x = 0\\) (the\n\u2018initial time\u2019), we get \\(y = n_{0}\\).) Going back to our\npenny stacking analogy \\((a = 1)\\), we again start with placing 1\npenny on the first square, but now about 2.7 pennies are stacked on\nthe second square, about 7.4 pennies on the third square, and so\nforth, and we finally end up with about \\(6.2 \\times 10^{27}\\) pennies\nstaked on the last square! Clearly, exponential growth outpaces linear\nvery rapidly. Finally, we have\ngeometric growth, which can be represented by the expression\n\\(y = a^{bx}\\), where \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) are arbitrary positive constants. Note that in the case\n\\(a = e\\) and \\(b = 1\\), we\nrecover the exponential \n case.[1] \n\n\nMany authors consider an important mark of chaos to be trajectories\nissuing from nearby points diverging from one another exponentially\nquickly. However, it is also possible for trajectory divergence to be\nfaster than exponential. Take Poincar\u00e9\u2019s example of a molecule\nin a gas of \\(N\\) molecules. If this molecule suffered the\nslightest of deviations from its initial starting point and you\ncompared the molecule\u2019s trajectories from these two slightly different\nstarting points, the resulting trajectories would diverge at a\ngeometric rate, to the \\(n\\)th power, due to\nthe \\(n\\) subsequent collisions, each being different than what\nit would have been had there been no slight change in the initial\ncondition.\n\n\nA third example discussed by Poincar\u00e9 is of a man walking on a\nstreet on his way to his business. He starts out at a particular\ntime. Meanwhile unknown to him, there is a tiler working on the roof\nof a building on the same street. The tiler accidentally drops a tile,\nkilling the business man. Had the business man started out at a\nslightly earlier or later time, the outcome of his trajectory would\nhave been vastly different!\n",
