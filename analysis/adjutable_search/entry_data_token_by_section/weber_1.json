    "main_text": "Philosophical Influences\n2. Philosophical Influences\n\nPutting Weber in the context of philosophical tradition proper is not\nan easy task. For all the astonishing variety of identities that can\nbe ascribed to him as a scholar, he was certainly no philosopher at\nleast in the narrow sense of the term. His reputation as a Solonic\nlegislator of modern social science also tends to cloud our\nappreciation of the extent to which his ideas were embedded in the\nintellectual context of the time. Broadly speaking, Weber\u2019s\nphilosophical worldview, if not coherent philosophy, was informed by\nthe deep crisis of the Enlightenment project in fin-de-si\u00e8cle\nEurope, which was characterized by the intellectual revolt against\npositivist reason, a celebration of subjective will and intuition, and\na neo-Romantic longing for spiritual wholesomeness [Hughes 1977]. In\nother words, Weber belonged to a generation of self-claimed epigones\nwho had to struggle with the legacies of Darwin, Marx, and Nietzsche.\nAs such, the philosophical backdrop to his thoughts will be outlined\nhere along two axes \u2014 epistemology and ethics.\n",
