    "main_text": "Values and Mental Disorder || Psychiatric Bioethics and Neuroethics\n8.3 Psychiatric Bioethics and Neuroethics\n\nSocietal attitudes towards mental disorders, added to features\nassociated with such disorders themselves, have given rise to a\nbioethics differing in emphasis from that addressing ethical issues in\nmost of general medicine. Widespread stigma about such disorder raises\nextra privacy and confidentiality issues, for example. Because of the\npowerful and disruptive effects of the experience of disorder,\nconceptions of disorder, and its treatment are often linked to the\nself and identity of the subject in distinctive ways (Tekin 2019). The\ncompromised perceptual, affective, and reasoning capabilities that at\nleast temporarily mark severe disorder are seen to jeopardize the\nwidely-valued traits of rational autonomy, responsibility, and\ncoherent and unified personhood, leading to challenges over agency and\ndecisional capacity (Radoilska 2012; Sadler, Fulford, & van Staden\n2015). And most significantly, treatment regularly employs coercive\nmethods.\n\nThese coercive practices are judged of serious moral concern. For\nexample, coercive treatment seems to jeopardize rights proclaimed by\nthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with\nDisabilities (2006). Important philosophical issues here include\nwhether there are person-centered and more paternalist principles that\nwould respectively obviate, and justify, coercive treatment; how to\ndefine coercion; what constitutes valid consent; and links between\ncoercion and stigmatizing consequences (Kallert, Mezzich, &\nMonahan 2011; Szmukler 2016; Cratsley 2019; Pouncey & Mertz 2019).\nRecent theorizing addresses \u201cmental disorder\nexceptionalism\u201d (different treatment for mental and physical\nconditions), proposing tests for everyone with reduced capacity,\nregardless of cause (Szmukler & Dawson 2011).\n\nAside from legal and moral liability, disorders affecting volition (in\naddictive and compulsive behavior) have been considered in light of\nthe moral capacities associated with attributing full adult\nresponsibility. Efforts to ground the intuition that sufferers from\nthese conditions are less than fully responsible agents have appealed\nto \u201cdeep self\u201d and also \u201creasons\nresponsiveness\u201d theories of responsibility. Neither theory alone\nhas been found to readily accommodate the collection of symptoms\nassociated with this group of disorders (Schramme 2014; Summers &\nSinnott-Armstrong 2019).\n\nThe related field of neuroethics explores developments and prospects\nin neuroscience possessing increased urgency, or distinctive\nrelevance, for psychopathology. (See Bluhm, Jacobson, & Maibom\n2012; Roskies 2007; Glannon 2015; Caruso & Flanagan 2018.) For\nexample, encroachment on \u201cmental privacy\u201d can be expected\nto disproportionately affect those with stigmatized genders, disorders\nand symptoms; and a future can be envisioned in which the semantic\nauthority of first person symptom descriptions is undermined by\ndiagnoses independently verified through imaging or other technologies\n(Maibom 2012). More generally, this new knowledge seems likely to\nfoster a trend from the treatment of disorder to its prediction based\non observed risk factors, which in turn permits initiatives such as\nthe identification and treatment of early onset,\n\u201cprodromal\u201d conditions in younger subjects (children and\nyouth), likely affecting identity development and self-management\n(Broome, Fusar-Poli, & Wuyts 2013; Whitaker & Cosgrove 2015;\nRadden 2018). (See entries on Philosophy of Neuroscience, and\nNeuroethics.)\n\nResponsibility concepts, together with those around personhood,\nautonomy, diminished capacity and individual rights, make up an\ninescapable aspect of the broad field of psychiatric ethics. Areas of\nrecent research concern responsibility and blame. Attitudes of blame\nare customarily treated as an appropriate sequel to assigning\nresponsibility (Watson 2004), but Hanna Pickard uncouples\nresponsibility from blame. At least for the apparently willful\nbehavior of those diagnosed with disorders affecting agency, she\nargues, the proper stance for the care-giver is grounded in an\nempathic attitude that assigns responsibility without blaming, because\nit is one most conducive to improvement and recovery (Pickard\n2011).\n\nClosely related responsibility issues involve the personality\ndisorders which, due to their long-recognized relationship to more\nnormal character weaknesses, and their evidently dimensional nature,\nsit uneasily within psychiatric classifications (Sinnott-Armstrong\n2008; Pickard 2011, 2016). One DSM grouping (cluster B personality\ndisorders, including borderline, narcissistic and antisocial), are\nbetter approached using persuasion, and methods reminiscent of the\n\u201cmoral treatment\u201d of earlier times, Louis Charland argues\n(Charland 2004).\n\nPhilosophical challenges to customary moral, ethical, and medical\npresuppositions introduced in this section have been influenced by,\nand are difficult to separate from, critiques of medical psychiatry\nthat have taken place not only within academe, but also beyond it.\nThese are discussed in\n Section 10.\n",
