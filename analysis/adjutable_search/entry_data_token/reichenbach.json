Provoked by the conflict between\n(neo-) Kantian a priorism and Einstein\u2019s relativity of space and\ntime, Reichenbach developed a scientifically inspired philosophy and\nan uncompromisingly empiricist epistemology. He was literate in the\nphysical science of his time, and acquainted with many of its most\neminent practitioners. Criticism and justification of scientific\nmethodology formed the core of almost all his philosophical efforts,\nwhich he promoted in a crescendo of books, in the journal\nErkenntnis, which he founded and edited with Rudolf Carnap,\nand within a group of philosophers, mathematicians and scientists he\nled in Berlin. His commitment to objectivity and realism in science\ntogether with his probabilistic justification of belief in scientific\nresults carried philosophical and technical difficulties that shaped\nmuch of the subsequent debate in philosophy of science.\nReichenbach\u2019s contributions cover large swathes of formal\nphilosophy, especially in philosophy of physics, logic, induction and\nthe foundations of probability, and his later work encompassed\nlinguistics, philosophical logic, and ethics. The fruits of some of\nhis insights are only belatedly having their full impact. For example,\nseveral of the recent accounts of causality employ ideas that can be\ntraced to Reichenbach\u2019s The Direction of Time. \n\nPartitioning the work of a philosopher with views about almost\neverything is indispensable in a retrospective, but in\nReichenbach\u2019s case separation is especially artificial. From\n1915 until 1953, most of his philosophical essays entangle issues and\ndoctrines about probability, causality, physics, epistemology and\nmetaphysics. Reichenbach\u2019s ideas about causality and probability\nare so intertwined that it makes little sense to discuss them\nseparately. Unavoidably, therefore, different aspects of the same\nworks are discussed in several sections of the following essay.\nReichenbach\u2019s views on all of these topics changed so radically\nover time that there is no one \u201cReichenbach system,\u201d and\nwe therefore offer a synoptic history of his views within each topic.\nAll of our citations are from the English editions of his\npublications, where available. \n", "toc": [{"#Lif": "1.

Life\n\nBorn in Hamburg, Germany, in 1891, Hans Reichenbach was the second of\nfour children of a half-Jewish but baptized father and a non-Jewish\nmother. In secondary school and at university he was active in the\nsocialist student movement. From 1910 to 1911 he studied civil\nengineering at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, and then moved\namong Berlin, Munich and G\u00f6ttingen, studying physics, philosophy\nand mathematics with some of the eminences of the time, including\nErnst Cassirer, Max Planck, Arnold Sommerfeld and David\n Hilbert.[1]\n He wrote his doctoral dissertation largely on his own after the\nneo-Kantian Paul Natorp would not accept him as his student. After\nsearching for alternative advisors, his dissertation was finally\naccepted by Paul Hensel, a philosopher, and Max Noether, a\nmathematician, in 1915 in Erlangen. Reichenbach was conscripted into\nthe army while completing his thesis. He served in the German army\nsignal corps on the Russian front until a serious illness sent him\nback to Berlin in 1916. He was relieved from active military duty in\n1917 to work as an engineer for a firm specializing in radio\ntechnology. In Berlin, Reichenbach attended Albert Einstein\u2019s\nlectures on relativity and statistical mechanics, which influenced him\nprofoundly, and inaugurated a life-long friendship between the two\nmen. He wrote several popular articles defending Einstein, especially\nin the context of the observations of the solar eclipse of 1919\nconfirming the predictions of the general theory of relativity. \n\nIn 1920 Reichenbach became an instructor in physics, and eventually\nassociate professor, at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart.\nThe Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge (1920f) was\naccepted as his habilitation in physics. In this period Reichenbach\nmarried Elizabeth Lingener and they had two children, Hans Galama in\n1922 and Jutta in 1924. While in Stuttgart he developed contacts with\nMoritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap and Erwin Schroedinger. In 1926, after\nmuch back and forth, he assumed a teaching position in \u201cnatural\nphilosophy\u201d at the University of Berlin, where he remained until\nHitler came to power in 1933. During this time Reichenbach organized\ndiscussion groups on scientific philosophy, similar to those of the\nVienna Circle (see entry on\n Vienna Circle).\n The group around Reichenbach that developed out of the Society for\nEmpirical Philosophy and became known as the Berlin Group included\nKurt Grelling, Kurt Lewin, Richard von Mises and later Carl Hempel,\nReichenbach\u2019s student. Together with members of the Vienna\nCircle, Reichenbach initiated the publication of the journal\nErkenntnis in 1930 as a forum for scientific philosophy.\nReichenbach and Carnap were the only editors after Schlick resigned in\nreaction to Reichenbach\u2019s opening article (see\n Section 4.4\n below). In addition (and also for financial reasons), Reichenbach was\na frequent contributor of popular essays and a regular radio lecturer\non scientific topics. \n\nWith Hitler\u2019s elevation, the views and methods of the Berlin\nGroup and Vienna Circle were branded Jewish philosophy, and\nReichenbach\u2014who counted as Jewish to the National Socialists and\nwas in any case considered undesirable given his socialist writings as\na student\u2014was dismissed from his university position and from\nradio work. He moved to Istanbul in 1933, where, as part of his\nefforts to westernize Turkey, Mustafa Kemal (Atat\u00fcrk) had\nestablished a new university to attract intellectuals fleeing Europe.\nReichenbach was joined there by 32 other German professors, notably\nRichard von Mises, the mathematician whose views on probability must\nhave influenced Reichenbach, and Erwin Freundlich. Freundlich had been\nEinstein\u2019s assistant in Berlin on matters astronomical, led an\nunsuccessful German expedition to Russia to measure the gravitational\ndeflection of starlight at the 1914 solar eclipse (the members of the\nexpedition became prisoners of war!), and later joined the\n\u201cEinstein Observatory\u201d in Potsdam. \n\nUnder a five-year contract which prevented him from accepting a\nposition at New York University arranged by Einstein and Sidney Hook,\nReichenbach remained in Turkey until 1938, when, through the efforts\nof many people, most notably Charles Morris, Reichenbach moved to the\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with his family. Hiking\nin the Swiss Alps shortly before his move to Los Angeles, Reichenbach\nsuffered a heart attack, which prevented him from teaching during the\nfirst months of his American appointment. (Reichenbach was an avid\nhiker and skier, but not physically impressive. His student, Cynthia\nSchuster, describes his appearance around 1950 this way: \u201cshort,\nalmost rotund, stubby hands and feet, round face, snub nose, thick\nglasses, false teeth, a hearing aid, and a thin high-pitched speaking\nvoice.\u201d (Reichenbach 1978, vol. I) His influence on students,\nshe says, was a case of mind over matter.) With the US entry into\nWorld War II in 1941, Reichenbach\u2014as a resident German\nalien\u2014was kept under effective house arrest, allowed to leave\nonly to work and for medical purposes until he obtained American\ncitizenship in 1943. During the war, Reichenbach was engaged in\nhelping to move members of his family out of Germany and to secure\npositions for colleagues at UCLA, in particular members of the\nFrankfurt School\n (Theodor Adorno,\n Max Horkheimer), who with Berthold Brecht and Thomas Mann became part\nof Reichenbach\u2019s German intellectual circle in Los Angeles. In\n1939 he was reunited with Maria Moll, who had been his colleague in\nIstanbul. They married in 1946, the day after her divorce. Despite\nbitter discussions at UCLA about the McCarthy era California Loyalty\nOath, in which each faculty member had to attest that they were not\nmembers of the Communist party, we are not aware of any written\nobjections from Reichenbach. He signed the oath in 1949/50, apparently\nunwillingly, as an understanding letter from Rudolf Carnap suggests\n(McCumber 2016, p.52). Reichenbach\u2019s untimely death from another\nheart attack on April 9, 1953, prevented him from presenting the\nWilliam James Lectures at Harvard in the fall of the same year, and\nalso prevented his inclusion in a planned volume of Living\nPhilosophers in the series edited by Arthur Schilpp. \n\nFurther Reading. Much more detail about Reichenbach\u2019s\nlife can be found in the excellent biography by Gerner (1997). Volume\nI of Reichenbach (1978) contains memories and comments from many of\nReichenbach\u2019s friends, colleagues, students and relatives.\nFurther biographical detail can be found in Salmon\u2019s\nintroduction (translated to German by Maria Reichenbach) to volume 1\nof Reichenbach (1977), in Salmon (1979), in Maria Reichenbach (1994),\nin Padovani (2008) and Kamlah (2013), while The Hans Reichenbach\nCollection (linked into the Other Internet Resources section\nbelow) at the University of Pittsburgh contains a wealth of\nautobiographical notes, in particular references HR 014-33-08 and HR\n044-06-21 to HR 044-06-26. Hoffman (2007) and Milkov (2013) describe\nthe historical developments of the Berlin Group and Irzik (2011)\nprovides the same for Reichenbach\u2019s move to Istanbul. Verhaegh\n(2020) traces in detail Reichenbach\u2019s move to Istanbul and the\ndecisions and hurdles that eventually took him to the U.S.\n2. Causality and Probability\n2.1 Doctoral Thesis\n\nReichenbach\u2019s doctoral thesis, The Concept of Probability in\nthe Mathematical Representation of Reality (1915b), contains many\nof the themes that concerned him throughout his life, and anticipated\nin some detail 21st century philosophical discussions of\nprobability relations between microscopic and macroscopic systems.\nIndeed, the development of his ideas about causality and probability\nfrom 1915 until the end of his life can be seen as a series of\nreexaminations and reformulations of issues the thesis implicitly\nposed and the solutions it explicitly offered. \n\nThe thesis develops an account of probability appropriate for\nscientific inference. It presents an argument to supplement what\nReichenbach understands to be Kant\u2019s transcendental principle of\ncausality with a transcendental principle of probability. In\nReichenbach\u2019s reading of Kant, the \u201cprinciple of\ncausality\u201d asserts that every event is preceded by a cause that\ndetermines it according to some universal law (see the discussion of\nKant\u2019s principle in Section 2 of the entry on\n Kant and Hume on Causality).\n The principle is \u201ctranscendental\u201d because it cannot be\nempirically established, but is instead a precondition for the very\npossibility of empirical knowledge. Reichenbach\u2019s claim is that\nthere is a principle of probability that has an equal status: it\ncannot be empirically established, but it is a precondition of\nempirical knowledge. It states that events are governed by a\nprobability distribution.\n\nReichenbach considers, and rejects, the subjective interpretation of\nprobability advocated by the then prominent philosopher and\npsychologist Carl Stumpf (1892a, b), and, less emphatically, the\nattempt at an objective interpretation advocated by Johannes von Kries\n(1886), a physiologist who had studied with Hermann von Helmholtz.\nAccording to Reichenbach, von Kries\u2019s account of probability\nneeds to be freed from the principle of insufficient reason\u2014that\nmutually exclusive events of which we have no knowledge that would\ndetermine differential probability are equally probable. As a\nsubjective principle, Reichenbach claimed, it had no place in science.\nReichenbach insists on an \u201cobjective\u201d interpretation of\nprobability\u2014in the Kantian sense as about the world of\nexperience\u2014for which probability statements are synthetic, but\nnot verifiable, claims about the empirical world. His task, as he sees\nit, is to demonstrate that probabilistic statements are supported by a\nclaim\u2014the \u201cexistence of a probability\nfunction\u201d\u2014which is a transcendental principle that is\nnecessary, and in combination with causal principles sufficient, for\nempirical knowledge. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s technical argument is an adaptation of Henri\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s results on probability functions and what have\nsince come to be called \u201cstrike ratios\u201d (Poincar\u00e9,\n1912, pp. 148\u2013150). By considering events collected in a\nhistogram, in which alternate equally narrow columns are black and\nwhite, Reichenbach argues that as the number of (independent) events\nincreases (and the width of the columns decreases) the ratio of black\nto white events within any interval of the abscissa will approximate\n1. Reichenbach\u2019s general idea is that if a variable X\nis divided into two or more classes of very small intervals of equal\nwidth (in X units) juxtaposed in a definite order and\nproportion, then there will be a probability for the occurrence of a\nvalue of X within any particular class that is invariant over\nall Riemann integrable probability distributions for X. (The\nRiemann integral of a function describing a curve is defined as the\nlimit of the sum of rectangles touching the curve as their width\napproaches 0.)\n\n\n\n\nReichenbach extends the analysis to error probabilities for physical\nmeasurements. He then argues that since all physical measurements are\nsubject to error, knowledge of natural laws is possible only if errors\noccur subject to a probability distribution, a proposition that is\nsynthetic but cannot be established empirically. Empirical knowledge\nthus requires both an a priori principle of causality for individual\nevents and an a priori principle of probability to ensure that\nindividual events can be aggregated into general laws. No explicit\ninterpretation of probability is forwarded, although Reichenbach\nimplies that probability claims are about frequencies of causally\nindependent events\u2014a notion for which probability theorists\nwould later substitute the idea of independent, identically\ndistributed events (see the entry on\n probabilistic causation)\u2014\n in observed and unobserved collections of cases. \n\nFurther Reading. The thesis with an introduction to the\narguments can be found in Reichenbach (2008). Re-statements and slight\nvariations of the arguments in the thesis can also be found in\nReichenbach (1920c), Reichenbach (1920e) and to a lesser extent in\nReichenbach (1930g) and chapter 9 of Reichenbach (1949f). A synopsis\nis also given in Padovani (2011), while Eberhardt (2011) provides a\ncritical assessment of the thesis.\n2.2 Views Prior to The Theory of Probability\n\nReichenbach\u2019s allegiance to Kantian formulations waxed and waned\nand transformed over time, but while the terminology changed,\nReichenbach long retained the essential claim of his doctoral thesis\nthat the establishment of any empirical law requires a superempirical\npresupposition about probability. In 1920, the argument and\nconclusions of the thesis were repeated with little qualification or\nvariation in two essays, \u201cThe Physical Presuppositions of the\nCalculus of Probability\u201d, and \u201cA Philosophical Critique of\nthe Probability Calculus\u201d. Again in \u201cCausality and\nProbability\u201d, in 1930, Reichenbach reprises the claims of his\ndoctoral thesis, but substitutes the \u201cprinciple of\ninduction\u201d\u2014that observed frequencies will continue to hold\nin new cases\u2014for the \u201cprinciple of probability.\u201d The\nprinciple of induction is not given an explicitly a priori basis, the\npossibility of which Reichenbach had come to doubt when studying with\nEinstein (see Reichenbach, 1920f). Instead, it is justified by an\nuneasy mixture of loose convergence arguments (foreshadowing the\nstraight rule, see below) and psychological habit. Without\nattribution, he dismisses a \u201cconventionalist\u201d account of\nthe principle of induction, expressed in nearly Kantian terms, as\n\u201cthe principle of induction is not a statement about the\nphysical world, but merely constitutes an ordering principle of\nscience.\u201d He argues that such an account does not\n\u201cjustify\u201d scientific preferences for simpler hypotheses\n(1930g, see Reichenbach 1978, vol. II, p. 340\u2013341). Arbitrary\nconvention could choose any scientific hypothesis that captures the\nphenomena, but a descriptively accurate account of theory selection in\nscience must explain why simpler theories should be preferred. The\njustification of the preference for simpler hypotheses remains\nunexplained in \u201cCausality and Probability\u201d, and\nReichenbach\u2019s own conclusion seems to be essentially the Kantian\nprinciple he rejects, supplemented with an attempt to prove that the\nprinciple of induction is unchallengeable because, in his view,\nprobability claims are generalizations over as yet unobserved cases\nand therefore presuppose the principle of induction: \n\nWe found that a probability statement is meaningful only if the\nprinciple of induction holds; therefore the statement that the\nprobability laws do not hold is itself meaningless unless the\nprinciple of induction holds. To say that probability laws do not hold\nis equivalent to predicting that the observed relative frequency of\nsequences of events will not be preserved in the future, that the\nregularity implied by the principle of induction does not\nhold\u2014and this statement has empirical meaning only if it can be\ndecided inductively, i.e., if the principle of induction holds. The\nstatement that probability laws do not hold is self-contradictory and\nmakes no sense. (1978, vol. II, p. 343)\n\n\nIn a further break with the Kantian tradition, the role of causation\nas conceptually primitive is reconsidered. It is difficult to pinpoint\nReichenbach\u2019s position between 1915 and 1935 since his writings\nmix epistemic and metaphysical issues. In his thesis (1915b) and in\n\u201cStetige Wahrscheinlichkeitsfolgen\u201d (1929L) Reichenbach is\ncommitted to individual deterministic causal events. In \u201cThe\nCausal Structure of the World\u201d (1925d) probability is regarded\nas the more fundamental concept. In later years Reichenbach often\ncited this paper as an anticipation of the indeterminism of quantum\ntheory, because his account allows the possibility that finer and\nfiner measures will not converge to deterministic laws (see Gerner,\n1997, p. 153). In \u201cCausality and Probability\u201d (1930g)\ncausality explicitly refers to regularities in populations rather than\nto particular events, a view whose source Reichenbach attributes to\nLudwig Boltzmann\u2019s development of the theory of gases. The\nseparation of causality and probability, and the recasting of\ncausality as a higher level concept, required that Reichenbach find a\nnew foundation for probability. Presumably due to the influence of his\ncolleague Richard von Mises, Reichenbach moved towards a view of\nprobability as a property of sequences. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s 1925 essay \u201cThe Causal Structure of the\nWorld\u201d (1925d) is also an early attempt to account for the\ndirection of time in terms of causal and probabilistic asymmetries.\nReichenbach there introduces the notion of a \u201cprobability\nimplication\u201d with 10 axiom schemes on propositional variables\ninvolving both material implication and a new 2-place probability\nimplication connective. The axioms are evidently meant to supplement\nthose of propositional logic. No rules of inference are specified, but\nsubstitution and modus ponens are used. The axioms do not guarantee\nthat a probability implication, a \u2287\n b[2],\n is the conditional probability of b given a, or\neven that the consequents of a collection of probability implications\nwith a as antecedent satisfy the axioms of finite\nprobability. Interpretation is difficult, since Reichenbach both\nasserts that the probability of the consequent in a probability\nimplication can be between 0 and 1 inclusive (1925d, 1978, vol. II, p.\n89), but then disallows a probability implication because the\nconsequent has probability 0 (p. 92). Reichenbach\u2019s thought\nseems to be that a \u2287 b asserts that in\ncircumstance a, b has a well defined probability,\nthat is, a specifies something like what Ian Hacking (1965)\nlater called a \u201cchance setup,\u201d or as Reichenbach might\nhave put it, implies the existence of a probability function for\n{b, ~b}. Reichenbach uses the operation very much in\nthat way in his 1925 discussion of the direction of time, which he\nthinks can be founded on cases in which a \u2287 b\nis true but b \u2287 a is false. Even under this\nreading some of his axiom schemes have false instances, e.g.,\n(a \u2287 b) \u2283 (a.c \u2287\nb), where the dot is ordinary conjunction. (The claim that\nb has a probability distribution in context a does\nnot necessarily imply that b has a probability distribution\nin context a conjoined with context c, since\nc might make a distribution impossible.) Revised, probability\nimplication later became a foundational notion of Reichenbach\u2019s\ntheory of probability and the central concept of his approach to\ninductive logic. \n\nFurther Reading. For Reichenbach\u2019s views on causality\nsee also the discussion of\n \u201cThe Direction of Time\u201d\n below and the separate entry on Reichenbach\u2019s\n Common Cause Principle.\n \n2.3 The Theory of Probability (1935, 1949)\n\nReichenbach continued to revise and elaborate his ideas about\nprobability in a series of papers in the early\n 1930s[3]\n until, in 1935, his The Theory of Probability provided a\nfuller statement of his developed view. Surprisingly, Reichenbach does\nnot acknowledge help from Richard von Mises, his colleague in Berlin\nand Istanbul in the period and the mathematician whose views on the\nfoundations of probability were closest to his own and are often\ndiscussed in the book. He does attribute part of the mathematical work\nin the book to Valentine Bargmann, who after finishing his doctorate\nin physics in Berlin fled to Switzerland in 1933 and later became an\nassistant to von Neumann and to Einstein at the Institute for Advanced\nStudy, from where in the 1940s he also assisted Reichenbach\u2019s\nwork on quantum theory. \n\nIt is fair to say that The Theory of Probability was not well\nreceived, drawing intense criticism from Karl Popper (1934), who had\nread Reichenbach\u2019s papers presenting a frequentist\ninterpretation of probability, C.I. Lewis (1952), Bertrand Russell\n(1948), and Ernest Nagel (1936, 1938). Kolmogorov\u2019s measure\ntheoretic axioms for probability, which appeared in 1933, soon\novershadowed Reichenbach\u2019s formulation of the theory of\nprobability. \n\nThe Theory of Probability uses class terms\u2014A,\nB, C\u2014and individual\nvariables\u2014x, y, z\u2014as well as\nreal variables\u2014p, q, u, r,\nw. Distinct individual variables are (unnecessarily)\nsometimes and sometimes not associated with distinct class names, but\nReichenbach\u2019s formulae without iterated probability conditionals\ncan be read as universally quantified with a single individual\nvariable. The earlier 10 axiom schemes for probability implication\n(1925d) are replaced by 4 axiom schemes expressed in\nReichenbach\u2019s abbreviated form as (1949f, p. 53\u201365): \n\nUnivocality: (p \u2260 q) \u2283 [(A\n\u2287p B)\u2009.\u2009(A\n\u2287q B) \u2261 (~A)]\nNormalization:\n\n\n(A \u2283 B) \u2283 \u2203p[(A\n\u2287p B)\u2009.\u2009(p =\n1)]\n~~A\u2009.\u2009(A\n\u2287p B) \u2283 (p \u2265 0)\n \nAddition: [(A \u2287p B) .\n(A \u2287q C) .\n(A.B \u2283 ~C)] \u2283\n\u2203r[(A \u2287r (B\n\u2228 C))\u2009.\u2009(r =\np+q)]\nMultiplication: [(A \u2287p\nB) . (A.B \u2287u\nC)] \u2283 \u2203w[(A\n\u2287w\nB.C)\u2009.\u2009(w =\np\u2217u)]\n\n\nReichenbach\u2019s intent with formula I is to say that where it\nexists, the probability has a unique value. Axiom II is meant to\nensure that the probabilities conditional on a nonempty set have\nvalues between 0 and 1 inclusive. Axiom III is Reichenbach\u2019s\nversion of the requirement that the probability of the union of\nmutually exclusive events is the sum of their probabilities. Axiom IV\nis essentially the chain rule of probability: P(CB |\nA) = P(C | BA)\nP(B | A). Axiom I is implicit in the\nKolmogorov axioms (see Section 1 (\u201cKolmogorov\u2019s\nProbability Calculus\u201d) in the entry on\n interpretations of probability)\n since probability is taken to be a real valued function. Axiom II\ncorresponds to Kolmogorov\u2019s first and second axioms, that\nprobability values are bounded between 0 and 1 inclusive. Axiom III\namounts to finite additivity because Reichenbach\u2019s\nlogic does not have infinite disjunctions: it is a finite restriction\nof Kolmogorov\u2019s third axiom, which postulates additivity of\nprobabilities for countable, even infinite, disjoint sets. Axiom IV\n(at least its interpretation in terms of the chain rule) follows from\nKolmorogov\u2019s first three axioms. Reichenbach requires it as an\nadditional axiom, because of his mixture of logical and mathematical\nnotation. Without the additional fourth axiom, Reichenbach could not\nswitch between logical conjunction and mathematical multiplication.\n\n\nReichenbach proceeds to show that finite frequencies satisfy his four\naxioms. He construes all probabilities as frequencies of sub-series in\na larger series\u2014or what is the same thing for finite sets,\ncardinalities of subsets in a universal set. Hence his probabilities\nare always with respect to a non-empty reference class, so the\nprobability that an event is in a class B is in\nReichenbach\u2019s notation, P(A, B) where\nA is the reference class\u2014similar to the modern notation\nof the conditional probability P(B | A).\nBut the probability logic axioms are so weak that many formal\nstructures satisfy them, and Reichenbach\u2019s claim is a long way\nfrom a representation theorem. He fails to provide the additional\nconstraints on the space that probabilities are applied to, which in\nKolmogorov\u2019s case are given by the assumption that the space is\na sigma-field, i.e. a field closed under complementation and countable\nunion. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s official definition of probability for infinite\nsequence pairs \u27e8xi,\nyi\u27e9 with\nxi in A, and\nyi in B, for which the limit\np of the relative frequency of B in A\nexists, is as follows: \u201cthe limit p is called the\nprobability from A to B within the sequence\npair.\u201d (1949f, p. 69). Constraints on the nature of the\nsequences are added later (1949f, section 30) that are aimed to\nformalize aspects of randomness. Probabilities of single cases are\n\u201cfictive\u201d or elliptical, to be understood as claims about\nthe frequency of a kind of case in an implicit reference class.\nElsewhere, Reichenbach puts more emphasis on finite frequencies and\neven suggests that limiting frequencies are simply a mathematical\ndevice for justifying inductive procedures (\u2018A letter to B.\nRussell\u2019, 1978, vol. II, p. 405\u2013406). Once introduced, the\nlogical framework is dropped in the mathematical development of\nprobability theory in the book. \n\nIn combination with the representation of probability relations by\nclaims in a quasilogical language, the limiting frequency\ninterpretation creates fundamental formal problems that Reichenbach\ndid not foresee. Sets of limiting relative frequencies are not closed\nunder finite intersection; they are not closed under countable union;\nthey do not satisfy countable additivity. They do not, in other words,\nform a sigma field, or a Borel field, or even a field. (See the\nentries on\n interpretations of probability,\n the early development of set theory, and\n set theory.)\n These and several other mathematical difficulties of\nReichenbach\u2019s setup are described in van Fraassen\n (1979).[4]\n\n\nReichenbach imposes two further axioms\u2014the axioms of order\n(1949f, p. 137)\u2014that are supposed to hold necessarily of\nlimiting frequencies for infinite time series. One is trivial,\nessentially asserting that a conditional frequency on lags\n(Reichenbach\u2019s term for lags is \u201cphases\u201d) of a\nconstant \u201cvariable\u201d can always be replaced by a\nconditional frequency on no lag of that variable. The second, however,\nappears to be a very strong stationarity principle that is not\ngenerally true: the probability of one variable conditional on a\nspecified common lag of other variables is invariant under all uniform\ntranslations of the lags. This axiom seems to derive directly from\nReichenbach\u2019s interpretation of the foundations of probability,\nin particular from Reichenbach\u2019s assumption about normal\nsequences, described below. \n\nIn addition to an axiomatization, Reichenbach attempts to provide a\nfoundation for probability claims in terms of properties of sequences,\nsimilar to von Mises. Reichenbach regarded von Mises attempt (von\nMises 1919) at formally characterizing a \u201crandom sequence\u201d\nas a failure and instead attempted to characterize a weaker sequence\nproperty\u2014a \u201cnormal\u201d sequence. In his account of\nnormal sequences Reichenbach retains (although the second only in a\nweaker form) two features that are deemed essential for random\nsequences: the lack of \u201cafter-effect\u201d and the invariance\nof the limiting relative frequency under subsequence selection.\nInformally, the \u201cinvariance under subsequence selection\u201d\nis supposed to capture the idea that the probabilities of events in\nany infinite subsequence selected from the original sequence by a\nprocedure based on the indices of events in the original sequence\nalone will be the same as the probabilities of events in the original\nsequence. \u201cThe lack of aftereffect\u201d is supposed to capture\nthe idea that given any initial segment of a sequence, one cannot\npredict the probability of the next event any better than predicting\nit based on the limiting relative frequency of events in the infinite\nsequence. Reichenbach\u2019s definition of lack of aftereffect is not\nbased on initial segments of sequences, but rather on subsequences\nselected by a particular set of rules (1949f, p. 142). Reichenbach\ndefines a \u201cselection\u201d S as any rule that\ndetermines for each member of a sequence whether it is a member of\nS (p. 143). He intends by a \u201crule\u201d literally any\nsubsequence. \n\nWe are unable to reconstruct exactly what Reichenbach may have\nintended, in particular since his definition of lack of aftereffect is\ndifficult to distinguish from the criterion of invariance under\nsubsequence selection. But we believe it is something close to the\nfollowing: A sequence of Bi is\n\u201cfree from aftereffect\u201d if (i) a subsequence is selected\nbased on a rule of the form \u201cFor each index i in the\nsequence, include the (i+k)th element in\nthe sequence if the ith element is B (or\n~B),\u201d (ii) if the subsequence thus selected has the\nsame event probabilities as the original sequence, and (iii) if this\nholds for all lags k > 0. If our reconstruction is\ncorrect, this would distinguish Reichenbach\u2019s account of lack of\naftereffect from that of invariance under subsequence selection,\nbecause the former includes subsequence selection rules that depend on\nthe values of certain items in the sequence, while the latter includes\nonly rules that are based on the indices. Two more definitions are\nrequired for the full picture. First, a selection S of a\nsubsequence of sequence A belongs to the \u201cdomain of\ninvariance\u201d of B, if the probability of B (for\nall lags) in S is unchanged from the probability of\nB in A, and if the same holds for any selection\nS from A with a lag. Second, a subsequence selected\nby an algebraic rule that partitions the sequence\nA\u2014e.g. take every fourth element (see p. 144 for\ndetails)\u2014is called a \u201cregular division\u201d of\nA. Putting the pieces together, Reichenbach requires for the\n\u201cnormality\u201d of a sequence A that it be free of\naftereffect and that all \u201cregular divisions\u201d of A\nare in the domain of invariance of B. This condition of\nregular divisions seems to underlie the stationarity expressed in the\nsecond axiom of order. \n\nIf random sequences are taken to satisfy (at least) the conditions of\nthe lack of aftereffect and invariance of subsequence selection under\nany selection rule, then Reichenbach\u2019s restriction of\nsubsequence selection rules to regular divisions implies that the set\nof normal sequences is a proper superset of that of random sequences.\nReichenbach accepts this weakening to avoid some of the difficulties\nin characterizing a random sequence, and to broaden his earlier\nnotions of probability to include sequences of trials, which might not\nbe perfectly independent. In later writings, he seems to suggest that\nas long as the sequence converges, probability claims can be applied\nto the component events. \n\nA large section of the book is devoted to reconstructing classical\nresults in the theory of probability as claims about relative\nfrequencies, including various continuous distributions and\nBernoulli\u2019s theorem. Reichenbach claims that probabilities on\ncontinuous domains are \u201cisomorphic\u201d to limiting relative\nfrequencies, but, as van Fraassen (1979) notes, it is difficult to see\nany sense in which that is true. The remainder of the book is not\nabout probability per se, but about its epistemological role. \n\nFurther Reading. A detailed attempt at the reconstruction of\nReichenbach\u2019s account of probability and its epistemological\ngrounding can be found in Eberhardt & Glymour (2011), which\nincludes specific references to the original sources. \n3. Epistemology and Metaphysics\n3.1 Early Views\n\nReichenbach began his philosophical career as a neo-Kantian, a\nperspective that is evident in his thesis and in his first book-length\neffort (1920f) after his doctoral thesis, and that at least echoes in\nhis later work. The aim of The Theory of Relativity and A Priori\nKnowledge is to reconcile Kantian theory in a limited way with\nthe theory of relativity by distinguishing two senses of synthetic a\npriori: Principles governing the content of experience can be\nsynthetic a priori because they are necessary, transcendental truths,\nor because they are non-empirical principles that form part of how we\nconstruct our representation of reality, and are thus revisable.\nReichenbach endorses the latter constitutive sense of the synthetic a\npriori, and sees his task as scrutinizing Kant\u2019s principles in\nlight of the \u201cnew\u201d reality described in the theory of\nrelativity. Reichenbach\u2019s\u2014never clearly\nspecified\u2014process of a construction of a representation is\nhidden behind the idea of \u201ccoordination\u201d. Particular\nprinciples, such as those of causality or probability, are supposed to\nestablish a correspondence between something in experience\nand our representation of it in the form of a mathematically\naxiomatized scientific theory (\u00e0 la Hilbert). What that\nsomething is, Reichenbach never clearly describes. He\nexplicitly rejects the proposal that it is just sensation, and he\nadmits that what he is describing is a curious case of \u201cthe\ncoordination of two sets, of which one [...set\u2019s] elements are\nfirst defined through the coordination\u201d (p. 40, 1965a). While a\npriori in the constitutive sense, the coordination principles are\ncontingent, they could be changed if experience makes others more\nconvenient. The picture is very much like that C.I. Lewis offers at\nabout the same time in Mind and the World Order (1929). \n\nReichenbach\u2019s account of the ascension from sense data to\nindividual things to scientific theories is via an account of testing,\nin spirit close to ideas that Hermann Weyl (1927) and Rudolf Carnap\n(1936) were later to advance, in which various hypotheses support one\nanother, each functioning as an auxiliary in tests of others, an idea\nGlymour (1980) later unsuccessfully tried to formalize as\n\u201cbootstrapping.\u201d The foundational character of sense data\nand the view that objects and their properties and relations are\nconstructions endures for some years in Reichenbach\u2019s thought,\nfor example in his 1929 essay on \u201cThe Aims and Methods of\nPhysical Knowledge\u201d (1929g), where, however, the example and\nauthority is no longer Kant\u2019s first Critique but rather\nRussell\u2019s Our Knowledge of the External World (1914)\nand Carnap\u2019s The Logical Structure of the World (1928).\n\n\nBy the late 1920s Reichenbach was moving away from neo-Kantian\npositions and towards logical positivist views, allying himself with\nthe Vienna Circle philosophers, although he always maintained and\nemphasized in retrospect that the \u201cempiricist philosophy\u201d\nhe pursued in the Berlin Group was much more focused and engaged with\nscience and did not fall prey to the positivist problems that came out\nof attempts to ground knowledge on sense data alone. He did not view\nhis contemporaries uniformly. For Moritz Schlick, Reichenbach seems to\nhave had a somewhat condescending respect, for Ludwig Wittgenstein,\nwho is one of the few philosophers whom he later criticizes by name in\nExperience and Prediction (1938c), and for Karl Popper, none\nwhatsoever. Aside from Einstein, his deepest respect and closest\nintellectual alliances seem to have been with Kurt Lewin, Kurt\nGrelling, Rudolf Carnap, Richard von Mises (although they do not seem\nto have got along personally) and Bertrand Russell, although\nReichenbach was not pleased with Russell\u2019s criticism of his\nviews in Russell\u2019s last philosophical book, Human Knowledge,\nIts Scope and Limits (Russell, 1948; see Reichenbach 1978, vol.\nII, p. 405). \n\nFurther Reading. Chapter 2 of Ryckman (2005) provides a very\nclear attempt at reconstructing Reichenbach\u2019s struggle with\nKantian principles in the 1920s. Padovani (2008) provides a wealth of\ntextual detail and references for the same period, with a more focused\nnotion of Reichenbach\u2019s notion of \u201ccoordination\u201d in\nPadovani (2011, 2015, 2017). Chapter 6 of Milmed (1961) traces the\nKantian elements in Reichenbach\u2019s epistemology and discusses the\nconflicts that arise, though the analysis concerns primarily\nReichenbach\u2019s mature views.\n3.2 Mature Views:  Experience and Prediction (1938)\n\nBy the 1930s Reichenbach abandoned foundationalism altogether and\nadopted an epistemological position closer to pragmatism than to\nlogical positivism. Reichenbach\u2019s mature viewpoint, presented in\nExperience and Prediction (1938c) diminishes the status of\nthe given; knowledge, belief and conjecture is built around his\nconceptions of meaning, probability and convention. Coordination of\nlanguage and physical circumstances replaces his earlier coordination\nof Kantian concepts and sensation. Reichenbach is a realist about the\nexternal world, but asserts that we can only have uncertain knowledge\nabout it, inferred from sense data. Deliberation can reject the gifts\nof perception so involuntarily received. Claims about ordinary\nobjects, and scientific claims about other kinds of objects, whether\nsense data or atoms, are probabilistic in nature and related by\nprobabilities, not by any kind of logical reduction. Reichenbach was\nnot alone in this view at the time. In 1935, in the second issue of\nAnalysis, Hempel, writing in English because Carnap could not\nat the time, described Carnap\u2019s viewpoint in similar, if not\nquite identical, antifoundationalist terms. \n\nThe overall account seems to be something like the following: Language\nrequires a coordination of words\u2014or at least\nsentences\u2014with something signified. Scientific language,\nReichenbach claims, requires \u201ccoordinative definitions\u201d\nthat specify physical procedures for measurement. A common example is\nthe \u201cdefinition\u201d of the Paris meter bar as a unit of\ndistance. Definitions in the usual sense occur within a language, but\nReichenbach sometimes appears to intend something like an\n\u201costensive\u201d definition (he does not use the term). He\ngives no account of how such an act can suffice to specify a rule, and\nhe recognizes instances in which it does not, for example that a\ncoordination that measures time by the behavior of clocks does not\nsuffice to provide a rule for deciding relations of time measurements\nbetween distant clocks. Various coordinative definitions may thus\nleave measures of other quantities or relations indeterminate, and\nthese must be specified by some stipulation or other. His chief, but\nnot only, example is the definition of simultaneity (see also\nRynasiewicz (2003), and Dieks (2009) for a clear discussion). \n\nOnce specifications of all relevant quantities are made, empirical\nclaims are possible. There are, in Reichenbach\u2019s view, two\nrelated ambiguities. First, different stipulations about measurement\ncan lead to apparently different empirical generalizations that\nnevertheless are empirically indistinguishable\u2014although just\nwhat \u201cempirically indistinguishable\u201d can consistently mean\nfor Reichenbach is problematic for reasons to be noted. Second, the\nsame total theory may be partitioned in more than one way into claims\ntrue by stipulation and empirical claims. Reichenbach\u2019s solution\nto these forms of underdetermination is that \u201cequivalent\ntheories\u201d say the same thing. The equivalence relation he\nintends is unclear. In earlier writings he suggests that empirically\nequivalent theories are those that have the same empirically testable\nconsequences; a later formulation is that empirically equivalent\ntheories are those that have the same (posterior) probability on any\nobservations. The later characterization is as clear as\nReichenbach\u2019s characterization of the probability of theories\nand their confirmation (see below). The earlier characterization\nresults in a semantics for which no effective proof theory is possible\n(Glymour, 1970). \n\nOne puzzle about Reichenbach\u2019s view of conventions is why\ncharacterizing them remained important to him, since they are, in his\nmature view, only a feature of the reconstruction of a theory, not an\nintrinsic logical or semantical feature of any proposition. In\nprinciple, separating out different presentations of the same theory\nand recognizing equivalence amid diverse conventions might be of\nvalue, but except in cases such as simultaneity and gravitational\ntheories with extra \u201cabsolute forces,\u201d Reichenbach did not\nuse reconstruction to that effect, and the most important question of\nequivalence in the physics of his era, the relation of wave and matrix\nmechanics, was solved in a quite different way by John von Neumann\n(1932). Reichenbach\u2019s emphasis on locating conventions seems\ninstead to be negatively motivated, a continuing prophylactic against\nclaims that various principles are a priori. \n\nThe immediate description of the perceptual world is in terms of\nenduring objects, their properties and relationships, and that\ndescription is only probable. The world can be described\negocentrically in terms of \u201cimpressions\u201d and \u201csense\ndata,\u201d but, Reichenbach argues, ordinary descriptions of things\nare not equivalent to egocentric descriptions in terms of impressions,\nbecause, however elaborate, egocentric formulations do not entail\nobject claims, they only confer a probability on object descriptions,\n(and, of course, in parallel, given Reichenbach\u2019s\nanti-foundationalism, egocentric descriptions are only probable). The\nargument is not in accord with Reichenbach\u2019s own criterion for\nequivalent descriptions, but the conclusion is repeatedly emphasized.\nReichenbach insists, sometimes in rather sharp language, that the\nlogical positivists and unnamed \u201cpretentious\u201d logicians\nare simply wrong about locating the foundations of knowledge in sense\ndata or analytical truths. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s mature views on the notion of analytic truth were\ncomplex. He no longer held with C.I. Lewis that there is at any time\nany sort of Kantian a priori\u2014but there is synonymy, there are\nequivalent descriptions, and the assertion of equivalence between\nequivalent descriptions is presumably a purely logical matter, hence\nanalytic. Although explicitly addressed to Carnap, C. I. Lewis was\nquite possibly an equal target of Quine\u2019s \u201cTwo Dogmas of\nEmpiricism\u201d (1951). (As Quine\u2019s senior at Harvard, Lewis\nwas unlikely to be criticized by name.) In a brief essay on\n\u201cLogical Positivism\u201d in 1945, Russell gently but pointedly\nridiculed Carnap\u2019s disposition to resolve every apparently\nirresolvable dispute by appeal to linguistic relativism.\nRussell\u2019s criticism, and Nelson Goodman\u2019s criticism of the\nvery idea of synonymy (Goodman, 1949), but perhaps not Quine\u2019s,\ncould have been applied to Reichenbach. \n\nAll empirical claims are, according to Reichenbach, probabilistic\njudgments based on relative frequencies in a reference class, or\nreached by induction. To the extent that reference classes rely on\nkinds, Reichenbach resorts to psychology: primarily, things are sorted\ninto kinds by the immediate perception of similarity, or by similarity\nin memory. Less primitively, theory and convention guide the\ndetermination of kinds. In practice he recommends the choice of the\nnarrowest reference class for which there are adequate statistics, a\nrecommendation that is of no help (why, or why not, should we throw\nvarious astrological theories into the reference class for assessing\nthe prior probability of general relativity?). \n\nPrimary or fundamental inductive inference consists of taking observed\nrelative frequencies as probabilities, that is, as limiting relative\nfrequencies. This procedure, referred to as the \u201cstraight\nrule\u201d, implies that one should take the current empirical\ndistribution to resemble the limiting distribution, and therefore\nbehave accordingly. The justification of such taking, or\n\u201cpositing\u201d in Reichenbach\u2019s terminology, is that if\nthere is a limiting relative frequency to a sequence, this procedure\nwill converge to it. Reichenbach notes in The Theory of\nProbability (1949f) that without further assumptions nothing can\nbe said about rates of convergence or about the warranted confidence\nthat an empirical distribution has converged. He further acknowledges\nthat any procedure that estimates the probability to be the relative\nfrequency, plus any quantity that keeps the estimate between 0 and 1\nand that itself converges to 0, will also converge to the limiting\nfrequency if such exists. He there (misleadingly) treats such\nalternative inductive rules as producing \u201cequivalent\ndescriptions\u201d to the straight rule and takes the choice as of no\nconsequence\u2014but of course the equivalence is only in the limit.\nIn Experience and Prediction (1938c) he instead dismisses\nsuch alternative rules on the vague grounds that they are\n\u201criskier\u201d than the straight rule. \n\nThe proposal of the straight rule goes back to the problem of\nassertability of probability claims he discussed in his thesis.\nReichenbach\u2019s proposal is reminiscent of the law of large\nnumbers, that the empirical distribution of a sequence of independent\nand identically distributed trials converges in probability to the\ntrue distribution. But the law of large numbers depends on\nindependent, identically distributed trials. Reichenbach cannot resort\nto such assumptions if he wants to avoid circularity in his account of\ninductive inference. Instead he introduces \u201cposits\u201d that\ncan basically be understood as leaps of (tentative) faith that the\nempirical distribution is representative. Posits can be\n\u201cblind\u201d or \u201cappraised.\u201d Posits are blind when\nthere is no data available to justify the posit. For example, if all\none has is a sequence of measurements for which the empirical\nfrequency distribution of events is given by F, then a blind\nposit might state that the probabilities specified by F are\nwithin \u03b5, for some small \u03b5, of the true distribution\nP. One has no reason to justify this claim, the posit is\nblind. However, if one had several sequences of measurements resulting\nin empirical frequency distributions F1,\u2026,\nFn, then the relative frequencies found\nin each of these empirical distributions can, according to\nReichenbach, be used to get higher order distributional information\nabout the original posit itself, and the posit therefore becomes\nappraised. So, if one has sequences of measurements of the\ngravitational constant from the Earth, the Moon, the 7 other planets,\nand, say, the Cavendish balance\u201410 sequences in total\u2014and\nin all cases except for Mercury, the gravitational constant is within\nsome small value \u03b5 of g, then the higher order\nprobability of the posit that the true value of the gravitational\nconstant is within \u03b5 of g is 9/10. How sure can one\nbe that the appraisal of the posit is accurate?\u2014For that\nReichenbach introduces again an even higher order blind posit. One\nthus arrives at a hierarchy of posits, of which the lower levels are\nappraised posits, and the highest levels are blind posits. Just how\nthe integration of different levels is supposed to occur, remains\nunclear and a point of criticism by Ernest Nagel (see below). The\ngeneral idea appears to be that at the \u201cdata\u201d level one\ncounts frequencies and integrates higher levels using Bayes rule. \n\nThe approach of estimating higher order distributional information on\nthe basis of subdividing the available sample is similar to the modern\nstatistical procedure of bootstrapping, although there re-sampling\ntechniques are used. Reichenbach argues that his procedure ensures\nmore efficient convergence than does na\u00efve application of the\nstraight rule alone. Faster convergence of the first level\nestimate\u2014the data-level\u2014is somehow supposed to result from\nsimultaneous convergence at all the different levels in this hierarchy\nof appraised posits\u2014Reichenbach refers to this as the method of\ncross-induction. But Creary (1969, Ch. 5) points out that there is no\nreading of such a conclusion about efficient convergence that follows\nfrom the premises Reichenbach assumes. \n\nOver time and place, the reasons Reichenbach gives for convergence of\nfrequency estimates to a limiting value vary, including 1) his early\nview that convergence is synthetic a priori, or that 2) the principle\nof induction expresses a kind of psychological habit, 3) the semantic\nargument we quoted above in Section 2.2 that the negation of the\nprinciple of induction is meaningless, 4) a pragmatic vindication that\ninduction using the straight rule works if any method of induction\nworks, 5) a convergence argument based on higher order probabilities,\nor 6) that there is no guarantee, merely \u201cposits.\u201d \n\nThe probability associated with any foundational claim must be\nunderstood as a blind posit, i.e. as a good guess, which according to\nReichenbach can take into account pragmatic considerations. Thus,\nReichenbach posits the existence of the external world as he thought\nit would make causal laws more \u201chomogenous\u201d (1938c). In a\nrather mixed metaphor, Reichenbach compares our knowledge of the\nexternal world to seeing shadows of flying birds on the walls of a\ncube in which one is confined. He argues that the patterns on the\nwalls, their regularity, would result in a high probability that there\nare objects outside the cube producing the shadows. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s eventual anti-foundationalism led him to a contest\nof opinions with C.I. Lewis, whose accounts of empirical learning and\nreasoning in Mind and the World Order (1929), and in An\nAnalysis of Knowledge and Valuation (1946) rested on a\nphenomenalist foundation of \u201cqualia\u201d (see the entry on\n qualia).\n Lewis, like Reichenbach a probabilist at heart, insisted that the\nassessment and revision of probabilities in the light of experience\nrequires that some propositions obtained from experience be certain,\nor as he put it, \u201cif anything is probable, something must be\ncertain.\u201d Reichenbach denied the claim, arguing that the\ndeliverances of experience directly provide, not certainty for claims\nabout qualia, but only probabilities for claims about ordinary things.\nThose probabilities can be revised in the light of further experience.\nFor the same reason, in his unremittingly critical review of Karl\nPopper\u2019s The Logic of Scientific Discovery (Popper\n1935), Reichenbach argues that probability assessments are essential\nin the \u201cfalsification\u201d of theories (1935e, 1978, vol. 2,\np. 372). Lewis\u2019 actual complaint appears to be based on a\nmathematical error when computing conditional probabilities.\nReichenbach pointed out Lewis\u2019 error, but did not provide a\npositive example to refute Lewis\u2019 concern (Peijnenburg &\nAtkinson, 2011). A more general problem that appears to have been\nmissed in the discussion at the time is that since Reichenbach held\nthat the probabilities of theories are to be assessed by Bayes rule,\nhis position, unlike Lewis\u2019, required a technical account of how\nclaims with non-extremal probabilities can produce changes in the\nprobabilities of others by some generalization of Bayes rule (see the\nentry on\n Bayes Theorem).\n Since on Reichenbach\u2019s view uncertainty is associated with\nobservation and perception and scientific theories are only confirmed\nwith a degree of probability, an account is required of how uncertain\ndata changes the probabilities of hypotheses logically remote from the\ndata. Much later, Richard Jeffrey (1983) provided an account of\nBayesian updating that explicitly relates the probability of the data\nto the probability of the hypothesis confirmed\u2014or\ndisconfirmed\u2014by the data (see the entry on\n Bayesian epistemology).\n \n\nBayes rule and the probabilities of theories posed another problem\npressed on Reichenbach by Ernest Nagel in a review in Mind of\nthe German edition of Reichenbach\u2019s The Theory of\nProbability (Nagel, 1936; see also Nagel, 1938). Nagel\u2019s\ncourteous review found a series of difficulties with\nReichenbach\u2019s theory, beginning with the logical status of the\n\u201cprobability implication\u201d which Nagel thought was not,\ncontrary to Reichenbach, of the same kind as material implication,\nbecause Reichenbach\u2019s relation is not \u201cextensional.\u201d\nNagel does not explain what he means, and Reichenbach\u2019s extended\nresponse in 1939 does not clarify the matter (1939b, 1978, vol. 2, p.\n388). In his response to Popper (1935e), Reichenbach had proposed two\nways of evaluating theories, one of which is to count the relative\nfrequency of true statements among the consequences of a theory. Nagel\npoints out that a theory 10% of whose tested predictions are false\nwould scarcely have probability 0.9. Reichenbach does not attempt to\ndefend this proposal in his reply to Nagel in 1938 (Reichenbach,\n1938a). That leaves the assignment of probabilities to theories by\nBayes Rule, which Reichenbach had also proposed, but Nagel observes\nthat if theories are to be evaluated by Bayes rule they must have\nprior probabilities. How can there be a frequentist prior probability\nfor a theory, since we do not know to what reference class to assign a\nparticular theory and, whatever the reference class, according to\nReichenbach we do not and cannot know which theories in that class are\ntrue? As in several of his other responses to criticism,\nReichenbach\u2019s 1938 reply is unfortunately more defensive than\nenlightening. About the reference class, Reichenbach says only\n\u201cI do not think this is a serious difficulty as the same\nquestion occurs for the determination of the probability of single\nevents\u201d and recommends the choice of the narrowest reference\nclass for which there are adequate statistics (though how the adequacy\nof a statistic for the truth or falsity of theories is assessed is\nnever explained). Reichenbach gave a sketch of such a procedure in his\n1935 reply to Popper, which Nagel pointedly does not think addresses\nthe problems. About the problem of the frequency of true hypotheses in\nthe reference class, Reichenbach says that we only need the\nprobabilities of theories in the reference class, not their truth or\nfalsity\u2014a question-begging reply that Reichenbach must have\nsensed is unconvincing because he promises to address the issue\nfurther in Experience and Prediction (1938c). The discussion\nof the prior probabilities of theories in section 43 of Experience\nand Prediction is unsatisfactory for the same reasons. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s most enduring distinction is between \u201cthe\ncontext of discovery and the context of justification.\u201d But\nReichenbach did not always allow the distinction, and the distinction\nhe intended is not quite the one commonly attributed to him. In his\n1922 essay on \u201cThe Philosophical Significance of the Theory of\nRelativity\u201d (1922c) the (now conventional) distinction between\nthe context of discovery and the context of justification is\nformulated in other terms, and rejected:\n\nIt is important to follow the concepts by which the theory finds its\nway step by step and to level criticisms at the theory from the same\nintellectual path as was used in the creation of the theory. This work\nderives from such an attitude; indeed to renounce this method would\nachieve nothing but to promote traditional representations to a status\nof absolute predominance. (Reichenbach, 2006, p. 97.)\n\n\nIn his review (Reichenbach, 1935e) of Popper\u2019s The Logic of\nScientific Discovery, Reichenbach suggests that theories are\nordered by their prior probability, and the theory with the highest\nprior is further tested. In Experience and Prediction (1938c)\nand in his reply to Nagel (Reichenbach, 1938a), published in the same\nyear, Reichenbach first formulates the distinction between the context\nof discovery and the context of justification with regard to\nmathematics: the mathematical relations are what they are, and how we\ncome to recognize them is an entirely different, psychological\nmatter:\n\nThe objective relation from the given entities to the\nsolution, and the subjective way of finding it, are clearly\nseparated for problems of a deductive character; we must learn to make\nthe same distinction for the problem of the inductive relation from\nfacts to theories. (1938a, p. 36\u2013 37)\n\n\nIn other words, the distinction is supposed to be between objective\nrelations among premises and conclusions, and subjective ways of\ndiscovering those relations. The \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d is\nnot about search for hypotheses or about the order in which hypotheses\nare considered but about the search for the objective inductive\nrelation between a theory and a body of evidence. What little\nReichenbach had to say publicly about how to search for promising\nhypotheses was reported in his review of Popper\u2019s book, and in\nhis dismissal in his reply to Nagel of Peirce\u2019s\n\u201cabduction\u201d as a confusion of mathematical and\npsychological relations. While Carnap later imagined an inductive,\nlogically omniscient robot (Carnap, 1960), and Hempel much later (in\n\u201cThoughts on the Limitations of Discovery by Computer\u201d,\nHempel 1985) claimed that computerized generation of interesting\nscientific hypotheses is impossible, Reichenbach seems not to have\ngiven any thought to questions about how to come up with hypotheses\nand about better and worse ways to search through the space of\nlogically possible theories. He had one fundamental procedure for\nestimating true hypotheses: the straight rule, and one secondary\nprocedure, whose application he never coherently explained, Bayes rule\nwith objective, frequentist, prior probabilities for hypotheses. \n\nFurther Reading.

Philosophy of Physics\n\nAlmost exclusively, Reichenbach\u2019s scientific interest was in\nphysics. He regarded chemistry as an appendage, entirely reducible to\nphysics, and his only publication touching the subject is on Marcelin\nBertholot (Reichenbach, 1927a), the eminent French anti-vitalist\nchemist. Of biology, Reichenbach leaves open (at least in 1929) the\nserious possibility that life exhibits phenomena that cannot be\nexplained by physical laws, and of evolution he remarks that it has\ndisappointed in failing to explain \u201cthe problem of life\u201d\n(1929g, Section 2). He believed Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic theories\nwere scientifically warranted by Freud\u2019s evidence, and in Los\nAngeles maintained friendships in the psychoanalytic community,\nincluding attending and sometimes lecturing at the Psychoanalytic\nInstitute. As a student Reichenbach showed some interest in psychology\n(Padovani, 2008, p. 13), however, except for brief passages in\nExperience and Prediction (1938c), Reichenbach published\nnothing about psychology, and we have no evidence regarding how\nfamiliar he was with Freud\u2019s publications. It seems unlikely\nthat Reichenbach knew Freud\u2019s remarkably candid descriptions\nbefore 1900 of his aggressive data collection procedures, and of\ncourse Freud\u2019s letters to Wilhelm Fleiss (Masson, 1986), which\nreveal how little Freud thought of his own methodology, were unknown\nto Reichenbach. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s most original work on the foundations of physics\nis in three books, Axiomatization of the Theory of Relativity\n(1924h), Philosophical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\n(1944b), and The Direction of Time (1956b). The first\nattempts an empiricist aufbau of the special and (in less detail)\ngeneral theories of relativity from experimentally accessible causal\nrelationships; the second essays a novel 3-valued logic for quantum\ntheory; and the third addresses a long standing problem in physics and\nmetaphysics. The Philosophy of Space and Time (1928h),\nReichenbach\u2019s most widely read, most elegant, and least original\nwork on physics, combines an extension to spacetime theories of\nHelmholtz\u2019s and Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventionalism about\ngeometry with a description of Einstein\u2019s special and general\nrelativity theories from the point of view of the\nAxiomatization, much of which it repeats. \n4.1 The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge (1920)\n\nEinstein\u2019s lectures on relativity in Berlin in 1917\u201318,\nattended at the time by Reichenbach and a handful of others, provided\na shock to Reichenbach\u2019s viewpoint. The Theory of Relativity\nand A Priori Knowledge, published in 1920, is an attempt to\nidentify neo-Kantian doctrines that must be abandoned and to\narticulate what can be salvaged. Twenty-five years before, in his\ndissertation published in 1897, Russell had undertaken a similar\nproject in connection with non-Euclidean geometry, arguing that\nconstant curvature is the geometrical synthetic a priori. In 1902,\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s Science and Hypothesis essentially\nsupplemented Russell\u2019s view with the opinion that the choice of\nconstant curvature geometry is underdetermined; the choice of one such\ngeometry rather than another can always be compensated by a change of\nphysics to save the phenomena. Without mentioning Russell or\nHelmholtz, Reichenbach takes general relativity to have refuted both\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s geometrical conventionalism and Kant\u2019s\ngeometrical apriorism. Most of the book addresses general\nepistemological issues discussed above rather than issues about\nphysics per se. \n4.2 Early Writing on Relativity\n\nBetween the publication of The Theory of Relativity and A Priori\nKnowledge, in 1920, and the appearance of The Axiomatization\nof the Theory of Relativity in 1924, Reichenbach published a\nseries of professional and popular essays expounding or defending the\nspecial and general theories and Reichenbach\u2019s own\naxiomatization, which was published in outline in 1921 in\nPhysikalische Zeitschrift (1921d). The professional essays\nwere variously addressed to audiences of philosophers or physicists.\nThey are interesting for our purposes chiefly because they state\nphilosophical positions that Reichenbach had previously rejected, or\nwould later come to reject, or because they offer interpretations of\nthe theories that are problematic. Notable in the last respect is\nReichenbach\u2019s view that general covariance is a substantive\nclaim of general relativity: the laws of physics have the same\n\u201cform\u201d in every coordinate system and frame of reference.\nReichenbach does not explain the idea of the \u201cform\u201d of a\nphysical law. \n\nWhile Kantian perspectives\u2014the a priori\n\u201cconstitution of the object\u201d\u2014still linger, the\n\u201cPhilosophical Significance of the Theory of Relativity\u201d,\npublished in French in 1922, signals a break with some of\nReichenbach\u2019s previous views (1922c). Perhaps influenced by\nEinstein\u2019s \u201cGeometry and Experience\u201d (1921)\nReichenbach no longer holds that, contrary to the conventionalist\nviews he attributes to Helmholtz and Poincar\u00e9, the theory of\nrelativity has established a geometry as part of physics to which\nthere can be no empirically adequate alternative. After introducing\nthe idea of a universal force affecting all objects no matter how\ninsulated, and noting that gravitation as usually conceived is such a\nforce, Reichenbach writes that: \u201cThe solution to the problem of\nspace is\u2026found only in this conception we call\nconventionalism\u2026which goes back to Helmholtz and\nPoincar\u00e9.\u201d (Reichenbach, 2006, p. 135). The idea that\nempirically indistinguishable hypotheses differ only\nverbally\u2014\u201cequivalent descriptions\u201d in\nReichenbach\u2019s terminology\u2014is already developed here. \n4.3 Axiomatization of the Theory of Relativity (1924)\n\nIn 1921 Reichenbach published a very limited pr\u00e9cis of the\napproach to the theory of relativity he ultimately presented in 1924\n(Reichenbach, 1921d). The Axiomatization is either a work\nvery much out of its time, or the times have not changed much.\nReichenbach\u2019s statement of purpose might have been written at\nany time in the last quarter of the 20th century in response to\nQuine\u2019s holism and to Thomas Kuhn\u2019s incommensurability\nthesis (see the entries on\n belief\n and on\n Thomas Kuhn).\n \n\n\nIt is not easy to arrive at\u2026a judgment with respect to the\naxioms of a theory. Usually the axioms, representing higher levels of\nabstraction, are quite remote from direct sense perception\u2026\n\nIn order to avoid this difficulty\u2026It is possible to start with\nthe observable facts and to end with the abstract\nconceptualization\u2026The empirical character of the axioms [about\nobservables] is immediately evident and it is easy to see what\nconsequences follow from their respective confirmations or\ndisconfirmations.\n\nUnfortunately\u2026every factual statement, even the simplest one,\ncontains more than an immediate perceptual experience: it is already\nan interpretation and therefore itself a theory\u2026The most\nelementary factual statements, therefore, contain some measure of\ntheory\u2026.\n\nDoes there exist any confirmation other than that of the theory as a\nwhole? \u2026Let us assume that the theory by means of which we\nexplain a certain fact is false and is to be replaced by a different\none. It is nevertheless possible that the new theory, when used for\nthe interpretation of this one fact, makes hardly any difference\nquantitatively, whereas it leads to considerable changes with respect\nto other assertions\u2026\n\nThe new theory has merely to satisfy the requirement that it will not\nresult in a practically noticeable quantitative difference when\napplied to these elementary facts\u2026For this reason all axioms of\nour presentation have been chosen in such a way that they can be\nderived from the experiments by means of pre-relativistic\noptics and mechanics. All are facts that can be tested without the\nuse of the theory of relativity\u2026The particular factual\nstatements of the theory of relativity can all be grasped by means of\npre-relativistic conceptions; only their combination within the\nconceptual system is new. (p. 5\u20137)\n\n\nThe book is divided into two parts, one on special relativity and the\nother on general relativity, each in some respects dependent on the\nother. The first part presents a series of postulates about the\nbehavior of light, accompanied by a series of definitions. The\nprimitives are a directed acyclic graph whose vertices are point\nevents and whose edges represent the relation \u201ca signal can be\nsent from event A and received at point B,\u201d\nand a partitioning of the event space by assignment of each event to a\npoint on some real line\u2014intuitively, a world line\u2014such\nthat the set of events assigned to the same line are equicardinal with\nthe line and their ordering by signaling is the ordering of the real\nline, and such that no two such world lines intersect. Axioms about\nthe behavior of signals, especially \u201cfirst\nsignals\u201d\u2014meaning light signals\u2014are intended to\nspecify sufficient constraints so that the coordination determines an\ninertial frame of reference in Minkowski space-time. Extensive\ndiscussion is given over to the impossibility of experimentally\ndetermining a \u201cmetrical\u201d simultaneity relation\u2014that\nis, of finding experimentally a unique simultaneity 3-space for an\ninertially moving observer. \u201cMatter axioms\u201d are then added\nspecifying transport properties of rigid rods and the connection of\nrigid rod distance measurements with round trip time measurements\n(although one of the \u201cmatter axioms,\u201d Axiom VI.2, is\nentirely about clock transport). Reichenbach asserts that the four\nmatter axioms that are restricted to inertial frames follow from his\nlight axioms. That is not true, and 60 pages later Reichenbach\nqualifies the claim to mean only that the relations follow from the\ngeneral theory of relativity. \n\nReichenbach very briefly discusses the classical tests of the general\ntheory of relativity: the red shift of light emitted from the sun, the\nbending of starlight passing near the limb of the sun, and the\nanomalous advance of the perihelion of Mercury. He summarizes:\n\u201c\u2026only the deflection of light and the red shift can\nfurnish evidence for Einstein\u2019s relation between gravitation and\nthe real metric\u2026\u201d (p. 170). A far more enlightening\nanalysis of the bearing of the classical tests had been given by\nHarold Jeffreys in 1919 and taken over (without acknowledgement) by\nArthur Eddington in The Mathematical Theory of Relativity\n(Eddington, 1924); Jeffreys\u2019s approach eventually led to the\nmodern parameterization of metrical theories of gravitation. \n\nThe Axiomatization has three difficulties. It contains a\nmathematical error discovered by John von Neumann in the proof that\ntwo frames of reference satisfying his five light postulates and\ndefinitions could not have a world line at rest in common. Reichenbach\nacknowledged the error in 1925, and again in 1928, without proposing\nany modification to obtain uniqueness. In an unflattering review,\nHerman Weyl gave a second reason (Weyl, 1924; see also Rynasiewicz,\n2005): the light cone structure of Minkowski space time does not\nsuffice to specify a unique set of inertial frames unaccelerated with\nrespect to one another, and hence neither do Reichenbach\u2019s\naxioms. By introducing a singularity in the infinite past, a system of\naccelerated frames can be used. Weyl took this fact to defeat the very\npurpose of Reichenbach\u2019s attempted reconstruction of the\ntheories: to found them on observable relationships. But perhaps the\nmost important problem is that much of Reichenbach\u2019s\nconstruction, without the philosophical commentary, had been\nanticipated by A.A. Robb, first in 1914 (A Theory of Time and\nSpace), and then in 1921 (The Absolute Relations of Time and\nSpace) for both special and general relativity. Reichenbach does\nnot mention Robb in 1924 or, to our knowledge, later, even though\nRobb\u2019s 1921 book was reissued with a different title in 1936.\n\n\nReichenbach\u2019s apparent unfamiliarity at the time with the\nEnglish language literature on relativity is notable and unfortunate.\nHe cites only one essentially English language source, from The\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics, and seems not to know of the\nwork of Jeffreys or Robb. He does appear to have read\nEddington\u2019s 1921 paper on Weyl\u2019s theory. Whatever the\ncause, the Axiomatization, which is one of\nReichenbach\u2019s most original technical efforts, would have been a\ndifferent work, or none at all, had he taken account of those\ndevelopments. \n\nFurther Reading. Section 4.4 of Ryckman (2005) provides a\nmore detailed analysis of what Reichenbach was trying to do in this\nbook. Dieks (2020) contrasts Reichenbach\u2019s and Weyl\u2019s\nfoundations of space and time.\n4.4 The Philosophy of Space and Time (1928)\n\nPublished only 4 years after the Axiomatization, The\nPhilosophy of Space and Time (1928h) is an engaging unification\nof a multitude of ideas Reichenbach had previously published,\nincluding the distinction between descriptive and inductive\nsimplicity, the synonymy of \u201cequivalent descriptions,\u201d the\ndistinction between differential and universal forces, the necessity\nof coordinating definitions and their \u201cconventionality,\u201d\nthe conventionality of spatial metrics and of \u201cmetrical\u201d\nsimultaneity, and the account of the logical structure of relativity\ntheories in terms of properties of causal relations in the\nAxiomatization. \n\nThe introduction to The Philosophy of Space and Time betrays\nthe Marxist inclinations Reichenbach retained from his student years.\nScience he says, has become mechanized, and develops so rapidly and\nautomatically that its practitioners cannot reflect on what they are\ndoing or why. (He might as well have said they are \u201calienated\nfrom their labor,\u201d but he did not.) A philosophical\ncounterweight (he might as well have said \u201cantithesis,\u201d\nbut he did not) is needed. The counterweight cannot be provided by\nindividuals announcing philosophical manifestos; it requires that\nphilosophers organize into groups so that, collectively, they can keep\nup with, and exercise analytic control over, the products of the\nscientific machine. The Vienna Circle, and Reichenbach\u2019s own\ngroup of philosophers and physicists in Berlin, are the models.\nTogether, philosophers should produce results, not\nmanifestos. This last demand was the conclusion of the editorial\nReichenbach placed in the first issue of Erkenntnis in 1930\n(Reichenbach, 1930a); Schlick and Carnap, his collaborators in\nfounding the journal, refused to sign the editorial, Schlick resigned\nentirely as an editor. \n\nThe book begins with a clear and compelling discussion of the\ninterdependence of properties and laws, illustrated through the\nrelations of alternative measures of length and alternative\ngeometries. The examples are then used to make two general claims,\nfirst that within the structure of complex theories there are\nidentifiable points that are definitions, and, second, that\nalternative systems of definitions and laws that account for the same\n\u201cfacts\u201d say the same thing, have the same content.\nReichenbach\u2019s \u201cdefinitions\u201d are not purely verbal,\nthey are \u201ccoordinative definitions\u201d that specify physical\nprocedures for determining the values of quantities. The point is\nreinforced with a distinction between differential and universal\nforces. Universal forces influence all objects in the same way (where\ntheory specifies what a \u201cway\u201d is) and cannot be shielded\nagainst. Heat, for example, is a differential force because it affects\nbodies of different compositions differently, whereas gravity is a\nuniversal force. A space with curvature can be equally described as a\nspace without curvature but with a universal force. Without explicit\nstatement, Reichenbach takes for granted the view, later defended in\nExperience and Prediction (1938c), that talk in coordinative\ndefinitions about ordinary, middle-sized, nearby physical objects and\nprocesses is intelligible and legitimate. \n\nReichenbach has a complex discussion of visualization. He introduces\nHelmholtz\u2019s idea that to visualize a geometry is to understand\nwhat experiences one would have in a world in which that geometry\nholds, and extends the idea to the visualization of spaces with\ncompact topologies, where, Reichenbach argues, Euclidean geometry\ncould be sustained but at the cost of causal anomalies. For example,\nin a toroidal space, travel on a geodesic would bring one back to\none\u2019s starting point, which, Reichenbach argues, would require\neither abandoning Euclid or else allowing \u201ccausal\nanomalies\u201d in the form of duplicate worlds at regular distances\nfrom one another. (By \u201cEuclidean\u201d geometry, Reichenbach\nmeans here a geometry on a manifold homeomorphic to\nR3, since there is a complete Euclidean metric for\ntoroidal 3-space.) Reichenbach gives other examples of causal\nanomalies but no general characterization. \n\nEven with Helmholtz available, Reichenbach is concerned to dispute\nfurther the very idea that Euclidean geometry has a privileged status\nin mathematical visualization that indicates some intrinsic limitation\nof thought. If humans had somehow been transported to a non-Euclidean\nworld, he says, they would have non-Euclidean\nvisualizations\u2014surely a puzzling counterfactual. The very idea\nthat \u201cpure visualization\u201d has some normative content is a\nmistake, he argues: \u201cthe normative function of visualization is\nnot of visual but of logical origin.\u201d (p. 91). We do not presume\nto know just what Reichenbach meant here, but for a plausible\nelucidation one might turn to recent philosophical work on the logical\nrelations implicit in geometrical diagrams. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s discussion of space and time begins with a near\nirony. Having argued against Kant\u2019s effort to justify the basics\nof Newtonian physics a priori, Reichenbach proceeds to argue that we\ncan know almost a priori that Newtonian theory is false. For\nexample, Newton does not distinguish between the length of a moving\nsegment and its length at rest, but according to Reichenbach, this is\nan a priori mistake: \u201cthe measurement of a segment with\na measuring rod that moves relative to it requires the\nformulation of a new concept\u2026The length of a moving\nline-segment is the distance between simultaneous positions of its\nendpoints.\u201d (p. 155) And further: \u201cIt follows from the\nnature of the extended concept of length that the length of a moving\nsegment is generally different from its rest-length.\u201d To say\nwhich is the true length is \u201cnonsense\u201d (p. 157). Thus is\nNewton refuted. \n\nMost of the rest of the book is a restatement of the\nAxiomatization with more extended examples and fewer proofs,\nand explicitly construed as a reduction of space time relations to\ncausal relations supplemented with definitions. The fundamental causal\nrelation to which Reichenbach appeals must be asymmetric and allow\nreidentification of objects or their features. Reichenbach thinks to\nobtain the asymmetry via a criterion of causation that invokes both\nthe preservation of something material and the asymmetry of\nintervention. A \u201cmark\u201d placed at the beginning of a causal\nprocess can be received at the end of the process; Reichenbach\u2019s\nexample is the color of a light signal. The asymmetry is that if the\nbeginning of the process is marked, the end of the process bears the\nmark, but if the end of the process is marked, the beginning\ndoes not bear the mark. The analysis thus depends on a distinction\nbetween observing a mark and the asymmetric relation of causing a\nmark. Reichenbach recognizes that for his empiricist, causal\nconstruction of the space metric, signals must be reidentifiable, a\nrelation he notes that Kurt Lewin had discussed (in his 1922\nHabilitationsschrift) as \u201cgenidentity\u201d (see also Padovani\n(2013)). Unsurprisingly, Reichenbach offers no guide to\nreidentification, which is obtained in all cases, including those of\nlight signals, from elaborate convictions\u2014or at least\nhabits\u2014about all kinds of details and regularities of the world.\nHad Reichenbach thought it necessary to his constructions in the\nAxiomatization first to establish empiricist criteria of\ngenidentity, the construction would not have begun. \n\nFurther Reading. Ryckman (2007) gives a more general overview\nof Reichenbach\u2019s philosophy of physics. Wilholt (2012, pp.\n44\u201348) provides a useful description of Reichenbach\u2019s\nconventionalism and Giovanelli (2016) discusses in great detail\nReichenbach\u2019s early views on the geometrization of physics by\ngeneral relativity which were at some point supposed to form an\nappendix to The Philosophy of Space and Time. The collection\nby Lutz & Tuboly (2021) contains several articles that provide\ncontext for Reichenbach\u2019s philosophy of physics.\n4.5 Quantum Mechanics and 3-Valued Logic\n\nReichenbach\u2019s discussion of quantum mechanics contains a (then)\nstandard presentation of the formalism of the theory, including the\nBorn rule and, without stating it, the Projection Postulate (see the\nentry on\n quantum mechanics).\n It is marked, however, by Reichenbach\u2019s empiricism about\nmeaning, by his frequency interpretation of probability, by a\nthree-valued \u201cquantum logic\u201d and by a curious neglect of\nthe major problems and of some the most important previous\nfoundational literature. For later philosophical readers, the missing\npiece in Reichenbach\u2019s discussion of the theory is the\nmeasurement problem (see the section on the measurement problem in the\nentry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory):\n he gives no account of how the dynamical equation of the theory can\naccount for uncorrelated measurement and object systems becoming\ncorrelated in a measurement interaction. \n\nThere was a considerable history of \u201cquantum logics\u201d\nbefore Reichenbach\u2019s work (see the entry on\n quantum logic).\n Martin Strauss had published a theory similar in spirit, but not in\ndetail, to Kochen and Speckers\u2019 partial Boolean algebras (which\nappeared only thirty years later; see the entry on the\n Kochen-Specker theorem),\n characterized by the fact that propositional connectives were allowed\nonly among simultaneously \u201cverifiable\u201d propositions.\nReichenbach objects that some quantum mechanical propositions whose\nlogical form contains no propositional operators may be unverifiable.\nPaulette Fevrier had also introduced a three-valued logic, to which\nReichenbach makes a similar objection. Strikingly absent is any\nreference to Birkhoff and von Neumann\u2019s 1936 paper on the\nlogical structure of quantum mechanics, which introduces a logical\nstructure for orthocomplemented lattices and projective geometries. We\ncan scarcely believe Reichenbach did not know of it and the neglect is\ndifficult to explain. Reichenbach seems to know of everything else,\nand he was in correspondence with Bargmann at the Institute for\nAdvanced Study. Reichenbach cites von Neumann\u2019s Mathematical\nFoundations of Quantum Mechanics (1932), but only with regard to\nvon Neumann\u2019s no hidden variable theorem (see the entry\non\n quantum logic\n and the section on the measurement problem in the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory).\n\nReichenbach\u2019s quantum logic has three values, True,\nIndeterminate, and False. Indeterminate is\nthe value of propositions that quantum theory implies cannot be\nassessed to be either true or false. Three unary propositional\nfunctions are defined, one corresponding to classical negation, as\nwell as seven binary functions, including classical disjunction,\nconjunction and equivalence. \n\nReichenbach gives no axiomatization and no rules of inference\n(although passages suggest he intended an analog of modus ponens to\nhold for his two new conditional functions) and of course he therefore\nprovides neither soundness nor completeness theorems. Nor does he\ncharacterize the class of functions that may be defined by composition\nof his propositional functions. He does derive various properties of\nthe new connectives from their definitions. \n\nReichenbach was quite explicit that logic is not empirical. \u201cThe\nrules of logic cannot be affected by physical experience.\u201d (p.\n102). His logic with Indeterminate as a value of propositions\nis the same as logic with \u201cnot empirically meaningful\u201d as\na value. In Reichenbach\u2019s view that is the logic, as it\nwere, with or without quantum mechanics. It is only that, before\nquantum mechanics, the principle of equivalent descriptions precluded\nany need to pay attention to the Indeterminate value. \n4.6 The Direction of Time (1956)\n\nAs early as 1925, Reichenbach had essayed a probabilistic account of\nthe direction of time (1925d) and in 1931 he still endorsed it,\nrejecting on familiar reversibility grounds proposals to rely on\nentropy increase. (1931i, 1978, vol. I, p. 336). His final work,\nalmost completed at his death, was on the direction of time. \n\nReichenbach did not doubt that we have a definite psychological\nseparation of time into past and future, corresponding respectively to\nevents that can and cannot be remembered. His concern in The\nDirection of Time is for a physical basis for the same asymmetry:\n\n\nThe problem which the physicist faces can be formulated as follows.\nThe elementary processes of statistical thermodynamics, the motions\nand collisions of molecules, are supposed to be controlled by the laws\nof classical mechanics and are therefore reversible, the\nmacroprocesses are irreversible, as we know. How can this\nirreversibility of macroprocesses be reconciled with the reversibility\nof microprocesses? (p. 109)\n\n\nThe issues of a specific physical explanation of the psychological\nasymmetry, and of how there can be a changing psychological\npresent\u2014a moving \u201cnow\u201d\u2014were to have been\naddressed in an unwritten final chapter. \n\nReichenbach offers three accounts of the direction of time. The first\nis that the direction of time in a region of space-time is the most\ncommon direction of increasing entropy among multiple nearly isolated\nsystems in that region. The idea, as Reichenbach notes, is\nBoltzmann\u2019s. The second answer is that the direction of time is\nthat in which causal events turn high entropy systems into low\nentropy, ordered systems. In the reverse direction of the same\nprocess, he says, from low entropy to high entropy, the sequence of\nevents is not causal but \u201cpurposive.\u201d Thus stepping in\nsand makes a shape (low entropy) from a flat surface (high entropy).\nThe reverse process, removing the foot from the sand followed by the\nfoot impression filling with sand is not causal, but purposive. We do\nnot pretend to understand this argument. The third argument intends to\nproduce a direction of time from causal directions inferred from\nmacrostatistics. This is the perhaps the aspect of the book most often\ndiscussed, and it both breaks new ground and occasionally stumbles in\nthe furrows. \n\nReichenbach argues that spatially and temporally close coincidences of\ntwo causal processes suffice to determine that the coincidence is\neither a common cause or a common effect of two other events. (He\npostpones the issue of how it can be known that there is any causal\nconnection between remote events.) He claims, correctly, that this\nimplies that a causally connected network\u2014an acyclic directed\ngraph\u2014of events can have only two orientations; reversing any\nedge requires reversing all other edges to yield an equivalent\ndirected graph. In an anticipation of 21st century discussions\n(Woodward, 2003), he considers whether interventions can disambiguate\ncause from effect in such a network, and argues that they cannot, on\ncounterfactual considerations that are not entirely clear to us. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s discussion of the relations of probability and\ncausality was begun in his doctoral thesis, and continued in his 1925\npaper (Reichenbach 1925d) which, until The Direction of Time,\nhe often cited himself with approval. In The Direction of\nTime Reichenbach acknowledges that the 1925 claims were incorrect\nand formulates a new \u201cPrinciple of the Common Cause\u201d this\nway: \u201cIf an improbable coincidence has occurred, there must\nexist a common cause\u201d (p. 157). In any instance, he says, the\nconclusion of the principle is not certain but only probable, the more\nprobable the more frequent the coincidences. He formulates four\nconditions he says are satisfied when an association of simultaneous\noccurrences of A and B is due to a common cause,\nC, simultaneous with neither A nor B:\nC is not independent of A or of B, but\nA and B are independent conditional on C\nand also independent conditional on ~C. He says the principle\nis sometimes used in a weaker sense, requiring only that the\nprobability of A and of B be raised by the\noccurrence of C, but he says, that the independence can\nusually be established \u201cby the use of a more detailed\ndescription [of] the cause C\u201d (p. 161, n.2).\nReichenbach does not say that his conditions are sufficient for\nC to be a common cause of A and B, and as\nArtzenius has noted, they are not (Artzenius 1993 and the entry\n Reichenbach\u2019s common cause principle).\n \n\nUsing the principle, Reichenbach considers how to distinguish\nstructures I and II below: \n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering only binary variables, Reichenbach says in structure I,\nthe common cause case, A and B are not individually\nindependent of C (the probability of each is greater\nconditional on C than conditional on ~C), but\nA and B are independent of one another conditional\non C and on ~C. He\nclaims\u2014erroneously\u2014that these facts do not distinguish\nbetween I and II, and indeed are typical of causal structures such as\nII. Using an example with the structure III he writes: \u201cFor\ninstance, the spouting of the geysers may have the effect that two\nclouds are formed which merge into one large cloud. Then the\noccurrence of this large cloud is an effect E which satisfies\n[the probability properties of I]\u201d (p. 162). This is an\nimportant mistake. In structure III, representing the causal structure\nof the geyser cloud example, A and B are independent\nconditional on D, but for almost all probability\ndistributions, A and B are not independent\nconditional on C and D. That is, III\nimplies (for almost all probability distributions) that none of\nA, B, C, D are independent, that\nA, B are independent conditional on D, and\nthat A, B are not independent conditional on\nC or on C and D. If the directions of edges\nin III are reversed, as in IV, the same relations hold, but with\nC and D interchanged. The direction of the causal\nrelations between the eruption and the formation of the large cloud is\nthus encoded in the conditional probability relations. Reichenbach\nmangles the relationships in a confused passage: \n\n\u2026if there exists a conjunctive fork with respect to a common\neffect E [as in structure II, with E in place of\nC], the simultaneous occurrence of A and B\nis more probable than a mere chance coincidence. Consequently, if\nthere were no common cause C [D in structure III],\nthe common effect would establish a statistical dependence between\nA and B and explanation would be given in terms of a\n\u201cfinal cause\u201d. \u2026we regard final causes as\nincompatible with the second law of thermodynamics and consider such\nforks impossible\u2026.this means: The principle of the common cause\ndoes not exclude, throughout, a statistical dependence with respect to\na common effect; but it does exclude such dependence if there exists\nno common cause. (p. 162)\n\n\nThus Reichenbach seems to think that in II above, A and\nB are independent conditional on C, but in III,\nA and B are dependent conditional on C and\nthe absence of D. Reichenbach\u2019s confusions on these\npoints is understandable\u2014well into the 1990s much the same could\nbe heard from several statisticians. In order to see the correct\nrelations, Reichenbach would have had to have explicitly formulated\nthe factorization of the joint distribution for binary variables that\nis implicit in his other discussions, and computed the joint\ndistribution of independent causes conditional on values of a common\neffect. He did not. Alternatively, with linear systems it is trivial\nto calculate the partial correlations of the causes controlling for\nthe effect, but Reichenbach undoubtedly did not know the formulas.\n\n\nHe continues with an illustration of \u201cscreening off\u201d and a\ndefinition of \u201ccausally between\u201d for events. The\nillustration is a causal chain A \u2192 B \u2192\nC. A and C are independent conditional on\nthe occurrence of B. He does not say that \u201cscreening\noff\u201d requires that A and C are also\nindependent conditional on ~B, but his statement of the\nPrinciple of the Common Cause strongly suggests as much. He defines\n\u201ccausally between\u201d as follows: \n\n\nDefinition 1. An event A2 is causally between the\nevents A1 and A3 if the\nrelations hold:\n\n1 > P(A2, A3)\n> P(A1, A3) >\nP(A3) > 0\n1 > P(A2, A1)\n> P(A3, A1) >\nP(A1) > 0\nP(A1. A2,\nA3) = P(A2,\nA3)\n\n\n(p. 190)\n\n\nRecall that the dot is conjunction, and\nP(A2, A3) in\nReichenbach\u2019s notation is P(A3 |\nA2) = P(A3.\nA2) / P(A2) in the\ncurrently conventional notation. Reichenbach goes on to claim that a\ncommon effect of two causes is causally between its two causes, thus\nA1 \u2192 A2 \u2190\nA3, which is obviously false if absence of any\ncausal connection implies independence. Throughout his life,\nReichenbach implicitly makes this assumption in his examples about\ncausal relations. With such an assumption, it follows that\nP(A1. A3) =\nP(A1)\u2009P(A3)\n\u2265 P(A1, A3) =\nP(A1)P(A3)/P(A3)\n= P(A1), contradicting (1) in the\ndefinition. One may take these and other examples as evidence that\nReichenbach did not have in mind instances of what is now called the\ncausal Markov condition\u2014that conditional on its relatively\ndirect causes a variable is independent of variables that are not its\neffects\u2014or, alternatively, that he was simply confused about the\nproperties of \u201ccolliders\u201d\u2014common effects\u2014in\ncausal graphs. We prefer the latter interpretation. \n\nCausal direction in a network is now determined by supposing an\nasymmetrical intervention is available, which Reichenbach calls a\n\u201cmark.\u201d Marks are assumed to be passed down causal chains,\nand to imply an increase in the probability of each downstream event.\nUsing the time order so obtained, \u201ccausal relevance\u201d is\ndefined as: \n\n\nDefinition 2: An event A1 is causally relevant to\na later event A3 if\nP(A1, A3) >\nP(A3) and there exists no set of events\nA2(1),\u2026,\nA2(n) which are earlier than\nor simultaneous with A1 such that this set screens\noff A1 from A3. (p. 204) \n\n\nDefinition 2 provides a clear anticipation of a proposal made 20 years\nlater by Patrick Suppes (Suppes, 1970). The Direction of Time\nends with a discussion of quantum statistical mechanics focused on\nissues of the identity of particles through time. \n5. Logic and Modality\n\nReichenbach entertained non-standard logics as early as 1925 in the\nform of \u201cprobability logic.\u201d In the Theory of\nProbability, probability logic amounts to no more than the\nassignment of probability values to formulas in the propositional\ncalculus. Later, a three-valued logic was introduced for quantum\ntheory, as discussed above. Reichenbach\u2019s major effort in logic,\nhowever, is in Elements of Symbolic Logic, published in 1947,\nbut begun as lecture notes for courses during Reichenbach\u2019s\nTurkish years. The book is notable chiefly for the extended and\ndetailed effort to formalize universal logical structures of\nconversational languages within the limits of first order logic and\ntype theory. Reichenbach\u2019s knowledge of German, English, French,\nand especially, Turkish, helped to make his proposals linguistically\nserious, and the result, a detailed, and in some respects quite\noriginal, logical grammar, including accounts of adverbial\nmodification, tense and modality, is substantially richer than related\nlogical efforts of his contemporaries. Other topics of interest, such\nas vagueness, are not discussed\u2014Reichenbach perhaps considered\nvagueness a mistake rather than a topic for logical analysis. \n\nIn 1948 Reichenbach circulated an unpublished manuscript (1948e, 1978,\nvol. 1, p. 409\u2013428), touching on Hilbert\u2019s program and\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems. Reichenbach was not persuaded that\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof of the impossibility of proving consistency\nwithin a sufficiently strong formalized language was of any\nphilosophical significance.\n\n\n\u2026a more profound analysis shows Hilbert\u2019s program to be\nunshaken, and independent of G\u00f6del\u2019s results.\n\nTo prove the latter statement first, let us inquire into the\nsignificance of the theorem stating that the proof of consistency is\nonly to be given in the metalanguage. What then would happen, if the\nmetalanguage should turn out to be inconsistent? This would lead to\nthe consequence, not that our deduction of the statement of\nconsistency is incorrect, but that the contrary of this statement\ncould also be deduced; and this indeed would make our statement\nvalueless. Now let us assume for a moment that G\u00f6del\u2019s\nsecond theorem did not hold, or with other words, that G\u00f6del had\nproved the contrary of his theorem.\n\nThis would mean that the proof of consistency of the language\nL could be given within L. A simple analysis shows\nthat this would not improve the situation, since in this case our\nproof of consistency of L would be of value only if we were\nsure that L is consistent. In case L were not\nconsistent, we could also deduce the statement of the consistency of\nL, with the qualification that then the negation of the\nstatement were deducible too. Thus if the consistency of L\nwere deduced within L, this fact would not prove the\nconsistency of L. (p. 409\u2013410)\n\n\nHilbert\u2019s meta-proof of consistency, by contrast, Reichenbach\nthinks is genuinely important. The consistency of any\n\u201cinterpreted\u201d formalism can be judged empirically if there\nis empirical evidence for the claims made within the formalism, and\nReichenbach argues that the proposition within the formalism that\nasserts that the interpreted formal system is consistent has an\nempirical probability (the only kind Reichenbach allows, of course) at\nleast as high as that of any other claim in the language. But for\nmathematics, the language must be separated into the part concerned\nwith rational numbers, which can be interpreted so that measurements\ngive rational numbers as values, and the part concerned with real or\ncomplex numbers, which correspond to no empirical measurement.\n\u201cSince all theorems of applied mathematics are deducible from\nthe subsystem [of physical interpretation of the field of rational\nnumbers]\u2026it is only this subsystem which is verified by the\ninterpretations.\u201d (1978, vol. I, p. 423) So we cannot\nempirically confirm any claims that are properly about real or complex\nnumbers, so we cannot empirically confirm their consistency. Hence we\nneed Hilbert\u2019s program of metamathematics, which, by\narithmetizing the claims of mathematical languages, reduces claims of\ntheir consistency to claims in finite mathematics about the\nmanipulations of symbols\u2014a claim that can be confirmed\nempirically (see the entry on\n Hilbert\u2019s program).\n We leave to the reader to diagnose how this separatist account fits\nwith Reichenbach\u2019s insistence that Bayes theorem suffices to\nestimate an empirical probability for theoretical claims that are not\n\u201cdirectly\u201d empirically confirmable. \n\nIn The Theory of Probability, modal necessity is identified\nwith universal quantification and possibility is identified with joint\nexistential quantification of a propositional matrix and existential\nquantification of its denial. At least the spirit of this account is\nretained in Reichenbach\u2019s later discussions of modality. His\naccount of modality in Elements of Symbolic Logic (1947c) was\ndeveloped as a separate work in Nomological Statements and\nAdmissible Operations (1954e), and is the basis for his\ndiscussion of possibility and necessity in his essay on freedom of the\nwill. Completed before his death and published soon after,\nNomological Statements and Admissible Operations was reissued\nin 1976 under the title, Laws, Modalities and\nCounterfactuals, with an invaluable expository foreword by Wesley\nSalmon. Reichenbach\u2019s own presentation is a nearly impenetrable\nmix of conditions on truth, entailment, logical form, and\nverifiability, which surely contributed to its lack of influence.\nLittle if any discussion of it is to be found in the decades of\nliterature on conditionals and counterfactuals since its\npublication.\n\nIn contrast to Carnap, who was at work on modality at about the same\ntime, Reichenbach understands the task of his theory to be to explain\nthe logical form and content of subjunctives, especially of\ncontrary-to-fact conditionals, and, at the same time, to explain how\nempirical evidence can warrant some counterfactuals, warrant the\ndenial of others, and leave still others undecided. He therefore\nregards the ability of the theory to account for our common sense\njudgments of the truth or falsity of sentences involving subjunctives,\ncounterfactuals, laws and modals as critical to its evaluation. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s theory is founded on an account of natural laws.\nHe views the logical form of all declarative sentences\u2014modal,\ncounterfactual or otherwise\u2014as specifiable in an extensional\nfirst order or typed language. Modality is a property of sentences,\nnot part of their content, and modal sentences therefore involve both\na declarative sentence and a meta-language claim about that sentence.\nAs in Carnap\u2019s account, all modality is de dicto.\nReichenbach is initially concerned with distinguishing conditionals\nthat, as indicative sentences, are true because of the falsity of\ntheir antecedents, from true (or at least assertable) subjunctive\nconditionals that have false antecedents, or antecedents not known to\nbe true. The former contain uses of propositional connectives (or\n\u201coperations\u201d in Reichenbach\u2019s terminology) that are\ninadmissible. Reichenbach\u2019s strategy is to characterize\n\u201cadmissible operations,\u201d that is assertable, subjunctive\nconditionals, and their truth values, by their deductive relations\nwith indicative \u201cnomological statements.\u201d \n\nFundamental or \u201coriginal\u201d nomological statements are those\nlogically equivalent to a true sentence (with no terms that\n\u201cessentially refer\u201d to particulars) in prenex form with at\nleast one universal quantifier and such that no logically stronger\nsentence in the same vocabulary is true. Derivative nomological\nstatements are logical consequences of original nomological\nstatements, but not all derivative nomological statements are\n\u201cadmissible.\u201d To avoid conditionals true because of false\nantecedents (or sentences true because of irrelevant disjuncts),\nReichenbach essentially requires that derivative nomological\nstatements be the logically strongest sentences in their vocabulary\nthat are consequences of original nomological statements. Statements\nare graded: Original nomological statements have grade 3, derivative\nnomological statements grade 2, and other statements grade 1. A\ncounterfactual conditional can only be true\u2014or\nassertible\u2014if its antecedent has a grade at least as high as its\nconsequent. Rather elaborate further conditions on logical form are\nimposed to avoid counterexamples. Counterfactuals about particulars\nare understood to be true if the corresponding indicative conditionals\nare instances of true nomological generalizations. \n\nModal claims of necessity are construed as indicatives combined with a\nmeta-claim that the indicative is nomological. Possibility claims have\ncorresponding meta-claims asserting that the denial of the indicative\nis not nomological. Almost as an afterthought, Reichenbach notes that\nquantification must be over possible as well as actual objects, but he\nprovides no logical mechanism for specifying such de re\nmodalities. \n6. Ethics and Free Will\n\nReichenbach\u2019s discussion of free action and free will is an\nattempt to reconcile our judgments that some actions are done freely\nand others are not with a scientific and materialist conception of the\nworld. An action is free if there is a prior circumstance in which a\n\u201cvolition\u201d of the actor causes the action, and in that,\notherwise the same, circumstance a volition to act otherwise would\nwith high probability have brought about a different action.\nReichenbach goes to some lengths to explain just how the volition must\ncause the action in order to be free, but the conditions are open to\nfairly simple counter-examples. He also makes no attempt to relate\nfree action to moral responsibility, or its absence to innocence. \n\nThe Rise of Scientific Philosophy (1951a),\nReichenbach\u2019s last and most successful popular book, presents\nhis broad philosophical viewpoint in an accessible way. The English\nprose is more fluent than in earlier works, and occasionally almost as\npithy as Russell\u2019s. Four chapters of the book provide\nReichenbach\u2019s review of the history of philosophical pretensions\nto a priori knowledge in metaphysics, epistemology and ethics. Writing\nof Kant, Reichenbach instructs: \u201cHis cognitive a priori\ncoincides with the physics of his time; his moral a priori, with the\nethics of his social class. Let this coincidence be a warning to all\nthose who claim to have found the ultimate truth.\u201d (p. 61) Of\nHamlet, Reichenbach writes \u201cTo be or not to be\u2014that is not\na question but a tautology.\u201d (p. 250) Much of the remainder of\nthe book consists of selective popular science summaries, amid\nsimplified restatements of the views in The Philosophy of Space\nand Time (1928h), and Experience and Prediction (1938c).\nThe news in the book is the extended discussion of ethics. In his\ncontribution to the Schilpp volume (1939a) on John Dewey, Reichenbach\nhad written at some length, and with considerable disdain, about\nDewey\u2019s ethical theory. (His personal relations with Dewey are\nunknown to us, but it is possible that Reichenbach knew and\ndisapproved of Dewey\u2019s enthusiasm for World War I.) About\nethics, Reichenbach was at least as pragmatic as Dewey, but about\nmetaethics, and in particular about the logical form of ethical\nsentences, he was in close accord with Charles Leslie\nStevenson\u2019s imperativism. To assert \u201cX is\ngood\u201d is just to assert \u201cI approve of X: Do so as\nwell!\u201d In The Rise of Scientific Philosophy he insists\nthat ethical statements express \u201cvolitional decisions,\u201d\nwithout truth values, that are not subject to empirical knowledge. The\nempirical issues of ethics are only the causal questions of relations\nof means to ends. Reichenbach allows a place for logic in reasoning\nfrom ethical premises to ethical conclusions, but he insists that the\ncharacteristic feature of ethical statements, and the proper\nconclusion of ethical reasoning, is a call to action. Whatever else\nthey are, ethical claims are imperatives. His recommendation for\nresolving fundamental ethical disagreements is not philosophy or\nscience, but \u201csocial friction.\u201d In keeping with his\npolitics, Reichenbach\u2019s last practical advice was the same as\nJoe Hill\u2019s: Organize! But Reichenbach\u2019s deepest ethical\ninjunction was implicit in his most popular book: to form beliefs, to\njudge them, to change them, to weigh actions, to distinguish real from\nmerely verbal differences, by the canons of scientific philosophy.\n\n\nFurther Reading. In a somewhat unusual description of\nReichenbach\u2019s work, McCumber (2016) characterizes The Rise\nof Scientific Philosophy as \u201cCold War philosophy\u201d\nthat prudently avoids the traps of its time.\n7. Reichenbach\u2019s Influence\n\nNo complete list of Reichenbach\u2019s doctoral students appears to\nbe available. After coming to UCLA in 1938 he had at least six Ph.D\nstudents known to us. W. Bruce Taylor studied with him between 1949\nand 1953, but we do not know about his subsequent career\u2014he\nlisted no academic affiliation in 1976. Melvin Maron and Norman Martin\nare listed by the Mathematics Genealogy Project as completing their\nPh.D.s with Reichenbach in 1951 and 1952, respectively, but we know of\nno further record for them. Cynthia Shuster became a professor at\nWashington State University, from where she was fired during the\nMcCarthy era for \u201ccorrupting the youth\u201d by inviting Robert\nOppenheimer to speak on campus. She continued her career at the\nUniversity of Montana until her death. Hilary Putnam, who was at\nPrinceton and then Harvard until his retirement, besides other\nimportant contributions less directly connected to Reichenbach,\ncombined Reichenbach\u2019s emphasis on learning in the limit with\nthe theory of computation to create the foundations of computational\nlearning theory, which remains a major theme in theoretical computer\nscience. Until his death, Wesley Salmon, who taught at Washington\nState, UCLA, Northwestern, Brown, Arizona and Pittsburgh, was the\nphilosopher who most prominently and loyally developed and defended\nReichenbach\u2019s views, especially but not exclusively his views on\nprobability and on the justification of induction. Carl Hempel took\nhis doctorate in Berlin with Reichenbach. After moving to the United\nStates, he taught at Yale, Princeton and then Pittsburgh.\nHempel\u2019s work on confirmation was discussed by Reichenbach but\nhad no connection to his own. Early in his career Hempel\u2019s\nthought was more closely connected with Carnap\u2019s logical\napproaches, while his later views were more closely allied with those\nof Thomas Kuhn, and in general his intellectual and personal relations\nwith Reichenbach do not appear to have been close. \n\nSome of Reichenbach\u2019s ideas have reemerged in recent philosophy\nwithout notice of the connection. Michael Strevens\u2019 Bigger\nThan Chaos (Strevens, 2003) reprises the views and arguments of\nReichenbach\u2019s doctoral thesis without the Kantian gloss. Gil\nHarman and Sanjeev Kulkarni\u2019s Reliable Reasoning (2007)\nadopts a view of induction very close to Reichenbach\u2019s. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s views on underdetermination in physics were\ndeveloped extensively by Adolf Grunbaum, but as a metaphysical rather\nthan epistemological thesis. The issue of the conventionality of\nsimultaneity relations has attracted a large philosophical literature.\nReichenbach\u2019s Principle of the Common Cause has attracted\nextensive philosophical comment, much of it devoted to purported\ncounterexamples to a strict universal claim that Reichenbach\nexplicitly denied. Without reference to Reichenbach, the principle was\nrestated in the 1950s by Herbert Simon (1954) as a claim about the\nexplanation of \u201cspurious\u201d correlations. Under the name\n\u201cMarkov condition,\u201d in the early 1980s Reichenbach\u2019s\nprinciple was generalized by several statisticians, most notably Terry\nSpeed (Kiiveri & Speed, 1982), and today plays an essential role\nin representation and search for causal relations. We do not know\nwhether Simon, who had been Carnap\u2019s student at the University\nof Chicago, knew of Reichenbach\u2019s ideas; the statisticians very\nlikely did not. Perhaps not coincidentally, the senior author of this\nentry, who helped to develop the directed graphical representation\ninto search and prediction procedures for causal hypotheses, studied\nwith two of Reichenbach\u2019s doctoral students, Schuster and\nSalmon. As noted above, Reichenbach anticipated formulations of\nprobabilistic causal relevance advanced by Patrick Suppes in A\nProbabilistic Theory of Causality (1970), and the use of\n\u201cmarks\u201d can be found in a somewhat different guise in\nSalmon (1984) and Dowe\u2019s (2000) work on causality. \n\nWith the exception of discussions of the \u201cconventionality\u201d\nof simultaneity, Reichenbach\u2019s Axiomatization seems to\nhave had little influence on subsequent work, whereas Robb\u2019s,\nrediscovered in the 1970s, has attracted some development from both\nphilosophers and physicists. The interventionist account of causation\nin the Axiomatization, and more clearly in The Philosophy\nof Space and Time, has been developed in various ways by several\n21st century writers, without explicit debt to Reichenbach. Michael\nFriedman (2001) has attempted to revive the quasi-Kantian viewpoint of\nReichenbach\u2019s The Theory of Relativity and A Priori\nKnowledge emphasizing the \u201crelativized a priori.\u201d\n\nA considerable literature in linguistics has pursued\nReichenbach\u2019s ideas about the logical form and semantics of\nconversational language, especially about tense and the logical form\nof adverbial modification (see Binnick in the Other Internet Resources\nsection below for a bibliography). Kamp (2013) lays out in some detail\nthe enormous influence in linguistics of Reichenbach\u2019s short\ncomments in Elements of Symbolic Logic (pp. 289\u2013298) that\nrecognized the distinction between speech time, reference\ntime and event time in the logical analysis of tense.\nThus, in the past perfect (\u201chad slept\u201d) the event time\nprecedes reference time, which precedes speech time, while in the\nsimple past (\u201cslept\u201d) the event time coincides with\nreference time, while both precede speech time (see also Malatesta\n2016). The subsequent analysis of reference time and its relation to\nevent time led to the development of formal semantics that could\nhandle a rich representation of context (e.g. Kamp\u2019s own\nDiscourse Representation Theory). In an ambitious book-length study of\nReichenbach\u2019s theory, McMahon (1976) takes Reichenbach\u2019s\nproposal to be a progenitor of Chomsky\u2019s theory of syntax, and\nattempts to supplement Reichenbach\u2019s account with appropriate\nre-write rules. Reichenbach\u2019s own discussion contains no\nexplicit generative grammar or computational models. \n8. Retrospective\n\nHilary Putnam (1991) has praised Reichenbach\u2019s work as\n\u201cone of the most magnificent attempts by any empiricist\nphilosopher of this or of any other century\u201d and called for more\nhistorical study of his work. We do not disagree, but a candid\nphilosophical retrospective assessment of any major philosopher is\nbound to find flaws. As Putnam emphasizes, in the end Reichenbach\ntried to found epistemology and metaphysics on probability relations,\nbut he evaded or dismissed coherent and pointed challenges from Ernest\nNagel and others as to how his conception of probability could serve\nthe purposes he required of it. Reichenbach\u2019s work repeatedly\nignored or discounted the contemporaneous or prior efforts of others\nthat address the issues that concerned him, efforts that are in one or\nanother way as good as, or importantly better, than his own. That is\ntrue with respect to Robb with regard to the causal construction of\nspace-time relations; it is true with respect to Kolmogorov with\nregard to the theory of probability; it is true with respect to\nBirkhoff and von Neumann with regard to quantum logic. The effect has\nbeen to make much of Reichenbach\u2019s best-known work something of\na scientific and philosophical eddy rather than a main current.\nReichenbach nonetheless was a central figure in forming the mainstream\nof 20th century philosophy of science as a crossdisciplinary study\ndevoted to reconstructing and \u201cjustifying\u201d received\nscience rather than to proposing novel scientific frameworks or novel\nmethodologies. At least in that fundamental respect, he remained a\nKantian throughout his career. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>": "</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<a href=\"publications.html\">Chronological List of Reichenbach\u2019s Publications</a>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Arntzenius, F., 1992, \u2018The common cause principle\u2019,\n<em>Proceedings of the Philosophy of Science Meeting</em>, 2:\n227\u2013237.", "Birkhoff, G., and J. v.
