Although the\nassistantship was soon approved, Feyerabend \u201cfelt quite\nuncomfortable. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it; I only knew that\nI wanted to remain in Vienna\u201d (p. 99). \n\nDuring this period Feyerabend, having nothing to do and needing the\nmoney, translated Popper\u2019s \u201cwar effort\u201d, The\nOpen Society and its Enemies into German, wrote articles on\n\u201cMethodology\u201d and \u201cPhilosophy of Nature\u201d for a\nFrench encyclopaedia, produced a report on post-war developments in\nthe Humanities in Austria for the U.S. Library of Congress, and made a\nmess of his first professional opportunity as a singer (p. 98). But he\nalso felt that he did not know what to do in the long run, so he\napplied for jobs in various universities.\n\nHe then met Arthur Pap, \u201cwho had come to Vienna to lecture on\nanalytic philosophy and who hoped, perhaps somewhat unrealistically,\nthat he would be able to revive what was left from the great years of\nthe Vienna Circle and the analytic tradition there\u201d\n(\u201cHerbert Feigl: A Biographical Sketch\u201d, p. 3). Feyerabend\nbecame Pap\u2019s assistant. Pap arranged for him to meet Herbert\nFeigl in Vienna in 1954, and together they studied Feigl\u2019s\npapers. Feigl had been a member of the Vienna Circle until his\nemigration to the USA in 1930, but he had never given up the\n\u201crealist\u201d view that there is a knowable external world. He\nconvinced Feyerabend that the positivism of Kraft and Pap had not\nsolved the traditional problems of philosophy. His paper\n\u201cExistential Hypotheses\u201d (1950), together with\nKraft\u2019s contributions and certain ideas Popper had put forward\nat Alpbach in 1948 and 1949, greatly diminished Feyerabend\u2019s\ndoubts about realism (ibid., p. 4). Here is how Feyerabend recounts\nFeigl\u2019s influence:\n\nIt was \u2026 quite a shock to hear Feigl expound fundamental\ndifficulties and to hear him explain in perfectly simple language\nwithout any recourse to formalism why the problem of application [of\nthe probability-calculus] was still without a solution. Formalization,\nthen, was not the last word in philosophical matters. There was still\nroom for fundamental discussion-for speculation (dreaded word!); there\nwas still a possibility of overthrowing highly formalized systems with\nthe help of a little common sense! (ibid., p. 5).\n\n\n1954 saw the publication of the first of Feyerabend\u2019s many\narticles on the philosophy of quantum mechanics, the first fruits of\nthe time he spent studying with Popper. In these publications, he\ngenerally took the line that the dominance achieved by the\n\u201cCopenhagen Interpretation\u201d of the quantum theory was\nundeserved. Feyerabend was particularly keen to argue that it had not\nand could not be shown that this interpretation of the theory was a\ngeneral panacea for the problems of microphysics, or that its\ndefenders could justifiably believe it to be unassailable. He came to\ndefend the right of \u201chidden-variables\u201d theorists such as\nLouis de Broglie, David Bohm, and Jean-Pierre Vigier to hypothesise\nthe existence of an unobserved deterministic substructure underpinning\nthe apparently indeterministic cavortings of objects on the\nquantum-mechanical level. \n\nHowever, Feyerabend also came to think that Popper\u2019s earlier\ncritique of the Copenhagen orthodoxy had been somewhat limited and\nsuperficial. According to Popper, the Copenhagen Interpretation was\nsimply the result of some bad positivistic philosophising. Niels Bohr\nand Werner Heisenberg, on this view, had been seduced by positivist\nphilosophers (like Ernst Mach and his ostensible followers, the Vienna\nCircle) into thinking that their theory was not conjectural but was\nmerely a compendious, economical but non-hypothetical\ndescription of experience. Feyerabend argued that, on the\ncontrary, the Copenhagen theorists had some perfectly good\n\u201cphysical\u201d, \u201cscientific\u201d, or\n\u201cfactual\u201d arguments for thinking that their view alone was\ncurrently compatible with the observed results of experiments. He\ntherefore put forward a defence of their instrumentalist\ninterpretation of the quantum theory. But the defence was only\ntactical, since he ultimately argued that the observed results of\nexperiments themselves needed to be challenged by a point of\nview which would reveal their truth or falsity. So Feyerabend used the\nquantum case to push for a reconsideration of the methodological rules\nto which scientists subscribe. This is the genesis of his idea of a\n\u201cpluralistic\u201d test model, in which theories are compared\nwith one another, as well as against \u201cexperience\u201d. (Note,\nhowever, that this idea can already be found in Popper, and that\nFeyerabend did initially acknowledge this fact). According to\nFeyerabend, only by endorsing scientific realism can the scientist\ncleave to a methodology which would consistently bring out the\n(conceptually) revolutionary potential of scientific\ntheories, rekindling the kind of fire Galileo had lit under the\nAristotelian world-view. Such a realism interprets theories\nnot as summaries of experience, but as genuine conjectures\nabout a mind-independent reality. It also puts the\nobservation-language of science in the same epistemological boat as\nits theoretical terms: observations, he urged, are just as\n\u201ctheoretical\u201d (that is, hypothetical) as theories:\n\u201cLogically speaking, all terms are\n\u201dtheoretical\u201c\u201d (Philosophical Papers, Volume\n1, p. 32 note).\n",
