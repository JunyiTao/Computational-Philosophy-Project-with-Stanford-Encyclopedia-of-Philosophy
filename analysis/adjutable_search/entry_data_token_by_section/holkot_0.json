    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nRobert Holkot was from the village of Holcot (or \u201ccot in the\nrock\u201d as he glossed it) near Northampton, and apparently a\ncommoner: he spoke of how the most capable men seemed to come from\nhumbler backgrounds. He joined the Dominican order, and if he received\nthe usual training, obtained his initial education in arts, logic,\nAristotelian philosophy, and theology within the Dominican schools. He\nstudied at Oxford, commenting on Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences in the years 1331\u20131333. Once he obtained his\ndoctorate in theology, he served as Dominican regent master there.\nSubsequently, Richard of Bury, the Bishop of Durham, chose Holkot as\none of his clerks to work with him in London. Tradition also places\nHolkot at Cambridge, where he may have served as a Dominican lecturer\nor regent master in theology prior to 1343, when he is known to have\nreturned to the Dominican priory of Northampton. He remained at\nNorthampton, teaching and writing, until his death of the plague in\n1349, acquired, as the story has it, while ministering to the sick\n(Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 1\u20134).\n\nHolkot produced a number of works over his lifetime. While he was at\nOxford, he lectured on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences, on\nMatthew and the Book of the Twelve Prophets, and engaged in ordinary\nand quodlibetal debates. He also engaged in a dispute with his fellow\nstudents about epistemology, published as the Sex articuli,\nand probably wrote another work, De imputabilitate peccati or\nOn the imputability of sin. A text, De stellis,\nOn the stars, a rough commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De\ncaelo was probably originally intended as part of his commentary\non the Sentences, but circulated as a separate tract. His\nSermo finalis, the final sermon given at the time of passing\non the lectureship on the Sentences to the next Dominican,\nalso survives (Wey 1949). While in London, Holkot helped Richard of\nBury with the book, the Philobiblon. Two works for preachers,\nthe Moralitates and the Convertimini, date from his\nlater years (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 233\u2013249). His most famous\nBiblical lectures, on the book of Wisdom, are associated with\nCambridge, and survive as the Postilla super librum\nSapientiae (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 162\u2013214). Portions of\nlectures on Ecclesiastes also survive, most likely from his time in\nNorthampton, and he was known to be giving lectures on Ecclesiasticus\nwhen he died. A sermon collection, spanning his career, has also been\npreserved (Slotemaker 2014; Slotemaker and Witt 2016). Most of these\ntexts exist (if they have come down to us) only in manuscript or early\nsixteenth century editions. Modern editions are available, however, of\nselected portions, sermons and questions, and of the Sex\narticuli.\n",
