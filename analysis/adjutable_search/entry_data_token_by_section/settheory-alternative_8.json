    "main_text": "Zermelo Set Theory and Its Refinements || From Zermelo set theory to ZFC\n4.2 From Zermelo set theory to ZFC\n\nZermelo set theory came to be modified in certain ways.\n\nThe formulation of the axiom of separation was made explicit:\n\u201cfor each formula \\(\\phi\\) of the first-order language with\nequality and membership, \\(\\{x \\in A \\mid \\phi \\}\\) exists\u201d.\nZermelo\u2019s original formulation referred more vaguely to\nproperties in general (and Zermelo himself seems to have objected to\nthe modern formulation as too restrictive).\n\nThe non-sets are usually abandoned (so the formulation of\nExtensionality is stronger) though ZFA (Zermelo-Fraenkel set\ntheory with atoms) was used in the first independence proofs for the\nAxiom of Choice.\n\nThe axiom scheme of Replacement was added by Fraenkel to make it\npossible to construct larger sets (even \\(\\aleph_{\\omega}\\) cannot be\nproved to exist in Zermelo set theory). The basic idea is that any\ncollection the same size as a set is a set, which can be logically\nformulated as follows: if \\(\\phi(x,y)\\) is a functional formula\n\\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z[(\\phi(x,y) \\amp \\phi(x,z)) \\rightarrow y\n= z\\)] and \\(A\\) is a set then there is a set \\(\\{y \\mid \\exists x \\in\nA(\\phi(x,y))\\}\\).\n\nThe axiom scheme of Foundation was added as a definite conception of\nwhat the universe of sets is like. The idea of the cumulative\nhierarchy of sets is that we construct sets in a sequence of stages\nindexed by the ordinals: at stage 0, the empty set is constructed; at\nstage \\(\\alpha + 1\\), all subsets of the set of stage \\(\\alpha\\) sets\nare constructed; at a limit stage \\(\\lambda\\), the union of all stages\nwith index less than \\(\\lambda\\) is constructed. Replacement is\nimportant for the implementation of this idea, as Z only\npermits one to construct sets belonging to the stages \\(V_n\\) and\n\\(V_{\\omega +n}\\) for \\(n\\) a natural number (we use the notation\n\\(V_{\\alpha}\\) for the collection of all sets constructed at stage\n\\(\\alpha)\\). The intention of the Foundation Axiom is to assert that\nevery set belongs to some \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) ; the commonest formulation\nis the mysterious assertion that for any nonempty set \\(A\\), there is\nan element \\(x\\) of \\(A\\) such that \\(x\\) is disjoint from \\(A\\). To\nsee that this is at least implied by Foundation, consider that there\nmust be a smallest \\(\\alpha\\) such that \\(A\\) meets \\(V_{\\alpha}\\),\nand any \\(x\\) in this \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) will have elements (if any) only\nof smaller rank and so not in \\(A\\).\n\nZermelo set theory has difficulties with the cumulative hierarchy. The\nusual form of the Zermelo axioms (or Zermelo\u2019s original form)\ndoes not prove the existence of \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) as a set unless\n\\(\\alpha\\) is finite. If the Axiom of Infinity is reformulated to\nassert the existence of \\(V_{\\omega}\\), then the ranks proved to exist\nas sets by Zermelo set theory are exactly those which appear in the\nnatural model \\(V_{\\omega +\\omega}\\) of this theory. Also, Zermelo set\ntheory does not prove the existence of transitive closures of sets,\nwhich makes it difficult to assign ranks to sets in general. Zermelo\nset theory plus the assertion that every set belongs to a rank\n\\(V_{\\alpha}\\) which is a set implies Foundation, the existence of\nexpected ranks \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) (not the existence of such ranks for all\nordinals \\(\\alpha\\) but the existence of such a rank containing each\nset which can be shown to exist), and the existence of transitive\nclosures, and can be interpreted in Zermelo set theory without\nadditional assumptions. A reader who wants to examine models of\nZermelo set theory which exhibit pathological properties in this\nregard can consult Mathias (2001b).\n\n\nThe Axiom of Choice is an object of suspicion to some mathematicians\nbecause it is not constructive. It has become customary to indicate\nwhen a proof in set theory uses Choice, although most mathematicians\naccept it as an axiom. The Axiom of Replacement is sometimes replaced\nwith the Axiom of Collection, which asserts, for any formula\n\\(\\phi(x,y)\\): \n\n\\[ \\forall x \\in A\\exists y(\\phi(x,y)) \\rightarrow \\exists C\\forall x\n\\in A\\exists y \\in C(\\phi(x,y)) \\]\n\n\nNote that \\(\\phi\\) here does not need to be functional; if for every\n\\(x \\in A\\), there are some \\(y\\)s such that \\(\\phi(x, y)\\), there is\na set such that for every \\(x \\in A\\), there is \\(y\\) in that\nset such that \\(\\phi(x, y)\\). One way to build this set is to\ntake, for each \\(x \\in A\\), all the \\(y\\)s of minimal rank such that\n\\(\\phi(x, y)\\) and put them in \\(C\\). In the presence of all other\naxioms of ZFC, Replacement and Collection are equivalent;\nwhen the axiomatics is perturbed (or when the logic is perturbed, as\nin intuitionistic set theory) the difference becomes important. The\nAxiom of Foundation is equivalent to \\(\\in\\)-Induction here but not in\nother contexts: \\(\\in\\)-Induction is the assertion that for any\nformula \\(\\phi\\): \n\n\\[ \\forall x((\\forall y \\in x(\\phi(y)) \\rightarrow \\phi(x))\n\\rightarrow \\forall x\\phi(x) \\]\n\n\ni.e., anything which is true of any set if it is true of all its\nelements is true of every set without exception.\n",
