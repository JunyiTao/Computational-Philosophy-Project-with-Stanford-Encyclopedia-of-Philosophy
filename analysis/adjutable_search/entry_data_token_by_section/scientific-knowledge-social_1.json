Big Science, Trust, and Authority\n\nThe second half of the twentieth century saw the emergence of what has\ncome to be known as Big Science: the organization of large numbers of\nscientists bringing different bodies of expertise to a common research\nproject. The original model was the Manhattan Project, undertaken\nduring the Second World War to develop an atomic weapon in the United\nStates. Theoretical and experimental physicists located at various\nsites across the country, though principally at Los Alamos, New\nMexico, worked on sub-problems of the project under the overall\ndirection of J. Robert Oppenheimer. While academic and military\nresearch have since been to some degree separated, much experimental\nresearch in physics, especially high energy particle physics,\ncontinues to be pursued by large teams of researchers. Research in\nother areas of science as well, for example the work comprehended\nunder the umbrella of the Human Genome Project, has taken on some of\nthe properties of Big Science, requiring multiple forms of expertise.\nIn addition to the emergence of Big Science, the transition from small\nscale university or even amateur science to institutionalized research\nwith major economic impacts supported by national funding bodies and\nconnected across international borders has seemed to call for new\nethical and epistemological thinking. Moreover, the consequent\ndependence of research on central funding bodies and increasingly,\nprivate foundations or commercial entities, prompts questions about\nthe degree of independence of contemporary scientific knowledge from\nits social and economic context.\n\nJohn Hardwig (1985) articulated one philosophical dilemma posed by\nlarge teams of researchers. Each member or subgroup participating in\nsuch a project is required because each has a crucial bit of expertise\nnot possessed by any other member or subgroup. This may be knowledge\nof a part of the instrumentation, the ability to perform a certain\nkind of calculation, the ability to make a certain kind of measurement\nor observation. The other members are not in a position to evaluate\nthe results of other members\u2019 work, and hence, all must take one\nanothers\u2019 results on trust. The consequence is an experimental\nresult, (for example, the measurement of a property such as the decay\nrate or spin of a given particle) the evidence for which is not fully\nunderstood by any single participant in the experiment. This leads\nHardwig to ask two questions, one about the evidential status of\ntestimony, and one about the nature of the knowing subject in these\ncases. With respect to the latter, Hardwig says that either the group\nas a whole, but no single member, knows or it is possible to know\nvicariously. Neither of these is palatable to him. Talking about the\ngroup or the community knowing smacks of superorganisms and\ntranscendent entities and Hardwig shrinks from that solution.\nVicarious knowledge, knowing without oneself possessing the evidence\nfor the truth of what one knows, requires, according to Hardwig, too\nmuch of a departure from our ordinary concepts of knowledge.\n\nThe first question is, as Hardwig notes, part of a more general\ndiscussion about the epistemic value of testimony. Much of what passes\nfor common knowledge is acquired from others. We depend on experts to\ntell us what is wrong or right with our appliances, our cars, our\nbodies. Indeed, much of what we later come to know depends on what we\npreviously learned as children from our parents and teachers. We\nacquire knowledge of the world through the institutions of education,\njournalism, and scientific inquiry. Philosophers disagree about the\nstatus of beliefs acquired in this way. Here is the question: If\nA knows that p on the basis of evidence e,\nB has reason to think A trustworthy and B\nbelieves p on the basis of A\u2019s testimony that\np, does B also know that p? Some\nphilosophers, as Locke and Hume seem to have, argue that only what one\nhas observed oneself could count as a good reason for belief, and that\nthe testimony of another is, therefore, never on its own sufficient\nwarrant for belief. Thus, B does not know simply on the basis\nof A\u2019s testimony but must have additional evidence\nabout A\u2019s reliability. While this result is consistent\nwith traditional philosophical empiricism and rationalism, which\nemphasized the individual\u2019s sense experience or rational\napprehension as foundations of knowledge, it does have the consequence\nthat we do not know most of what we think we know.\n\nA number of philosophers have recently offered alternative analyses\nfocusing on one or another element in the problem. Some argue that\ntestimony by a qualified expert is itself evidential, (Schmitt 1988),\nothers that the expert\u2019s evidence constitutes good reason for,\nbut is not itself evidential for the recipient of testimony (Hardwig\n1985, 1988), others that what is transmitted in testimony is knowledge\nand not just propositional content and thus the question of the kind\nof reason a recipient of testimony has is not to the point (Welbourne\n1981).\n\nHowever this dispute is resolved, questions of trust and authority\narise in a particularly pointed way in the sciences, and\nHardwig\u2019s dilemma for the physics experiment is also a specific\nversion of a more general phenomenon. A popular conception of science,\nfed partly by Popper\u2019s falsificationism, is that it is\nepistemically reliable because the results of experiments and\nobservational studies are checked by independent repetition. In\npractice, however, only some results are so checked and many are\nsimply accepted on trust. Not only must positive results be accepted\non trust, but claims of failure to replicate as well as other\ncritiques must be also. Thus, just as in the non-scientific world\ninformation is accepted on trust, so in science, knowledge grows by\ndepending on the testimony of others. What are the implications of\naccepting this fact for our conceptions of the reliability of\nscientific knowledge?\n\nThe philosopher of biology, David Hull, argued in his (1988) that\nbecause the overall structure of reward and punishment in the sciences\nis a powerful incentive not to cheat, further epistemological analysis\nof the sciences is unnecessary. What scientists have to lose is their\nreputation, which is crucial to their access to grants,\ncollaborations, prizes, etc. So the structure itself guarantees the\nveridicality of research reports. But some celebrated recent episodes,\nsuch as the purported production of \u201ccold fusion\u201d were\ncharacterized by the failure of replication attempts to produce the\nsame phenomenon. And, while the advocates of cold fusion were\nconvinced that their experiments had produced the phenomenon, there\nhave also been cases of outright fraud. Thus, even if the structure of\nreward and punishment is an incentive not to cheat, it does not\nguarantee the veridicality of every research report.\n\nOn Hull\u2019s view, the scientific community seeks true theories or\nadequate models. Credit, or recognition, accrues to individuals to the\nextent they are perceived as having contributed to that community\ngoal. That is, individual scientists seek reputation and recognition,\nto have their work cited as important and as necessary to further\nscientific progress. Cheating, by misreporting experimental results or\nother misconduct, will be punished by loss of reputation. But this\ndepends on strong guarantees of detection. Absent such guarantees,\nthere is as strong an incentive to cheat, to try to obtain credit\nwithout necessarily having done the work, as not to cheat.\n\nBoth Alvin Goldman (Goldman, 1995, 1999) and Philip Kitcher (1993)\nhave treated the potential for premature, or otherwise (improperly)\ninterested reporting of results to corrupt the sciences as a question\nto be answered by means of decision theoretic models. The decision\ntheoretic approach to problems of trust and authority treats both\ncredit and truth as utilities. The challenge then is to devise\nformulas that show that actions designed to maximize credit also\nmaximize truth. Kitcher, in particular, develops formulas intended to\nshow that even in situations peopled by non-epistemically motivated\nindividuals (that is, individuals motivated more by a desire for\ncredit than by a desire for truth), the reward structure of the\ncommunity can be organized in such a way as to maximize truth and\nfoster scientific progress. One consequence of this approach is to\ntreat scientific fraud and value or interest infused science as the\nsame problem. One advantage is that it incorporates the motivation to\ncheat into the solution to the problem of cheating. But one may wonder\nhow effective this solution really is. Increasingly, we learn of\nproblematic behavior in science based industries, such as the\npharmaceutical industry. Results are withheld or distorted, authorship\nis manipulated. Hot areas, such as stem cell research, cloning, or\ngene modification, have been subjected to fraudulent research. Thus,\neven if the structure of reward and punishment is an in principle\nincentive not to cheat, it does not guarantee the reliability of every\nresearch report. The decision theoretic model needs to include at\nleast one more parameter, namely the anticipated likelihood of\ndetection within a relevant timeframe.\n\nCommunity issues have also been addressed under the banners of\nresearch ethics and of peer review. One might think that the only\nethical requirements on scientists are to protect their research\nsubjects from harm and, as professional scientists, to seek truth\nabove any other goals. This presupposes that seeking truth is a\nsufficient guide to scientific decision-making. Heather Douglas, in\nher critical study of the ideal of value-freedom (Douglas 2009),\nrejects this notion. Douglas draws on her earlier study of inductive\nrisk (Douglas 2000) to press the point that countless methodological\ndecisions required in the course of carrying out a single piece of\nresearch are underdetermined by the factual elements of the situation\nand must be guided by an assessment of the consequences of being\nwrong. Science is not value-free, but can be protected from the\ndeleterious effects of values if scientists take steps to mitigate the\ninfluence of inappropriate values. One step is to distinguish between\ndirect and indirect roles of values; another is the articulation of\nguidelines for individual scientists. Values play a direct role when\nthey provide direct motivation to accept or reject a theory; they play\nan indirect role when they play a role in evaluating the consequences\nof accepting or rejecting a claim, thus influencing what will count as\nsufficient evidence to accept or reject. The responsibility of\nscientists is to make sure that values do not play a direct role in\ntheir work and to be transparent about the indirect roles of values. A\nnumber of writers have taken issue with the tenability of\nDouglas\u2019s distinction between direct and indirect. Steel and\nWhyte (2012) examine testing guidelines developed by pharmaceutical\ncompanies to point out that the very same decision may be motivated by\nvalues playing a direct role or playing an indirect role. If the point\nis to prohibit practices such as withholding negative results, then it\nshouldn\u2019t matter whether the practice is motivated by values\nfunctioning directly or indirectly. Elliott (2011) questions whether\nonly harmful consequences should be considered. If science is to be\nuseful to policy makers, then questions of relative social benefit\nshould also be permitted to play a role. Finally the cognitive\nactivities demanded by Douglas\u2019s ethical prescriptions for\nscientists seem beyond the capacities of individual scientists. This\npoint will be pursued below.\n\nTorsten Wilholt (2013) argues that the research situation is more\ncomplicated than the epistemic vs. nonepistemic tradeoff implied by\nthe decision theoretic approach. In part because of the difficulties\nin achieving the degree of knowledge required to realize\nDouglas\u2019s ethical prescriptions, he argues that the reliance\ncalled for in science extends beyond the veridicality of reported\nresults to the values guiding the investigators relied upon. Most\nresearch involves both results expressed statistically (which requires\nchoice of significance threshold and balancing chances of Type I vs.\nType II error) and multiple steps each requiring methodological\ndecisions. These decisions, Wilholt argues, represent trade-offs among\nthe reliability of positive results, the reliability of negative\nresults, and the power of the investigation. In making these\ntradeoffs, the investigator is per force guided by an evaluation of\nthe consequences of the various possible outcomes of the study.\nWilholt extends the arguments about inductive risk offered originally\nby Richard Rudner and elaborated by Heather Douglas to propose that,\nin relying on another\u2019s results I am relying not only on their\ncompetence and truthfulness, but on their making methodological\ndecisions informed by the same valuations of outcomes as I have. This\nattitude is more than epistemic reliance, but a deeper attitude: one\nof trust that we are guided by the same values in a shared enterprise.\nFor Wilholt, then, scientific inquiry engages ethical norms as well as\nepistemic norms. Formal or mechanical solutions such as those\nsuggested by the application of decision theoretic models are not\nsufficient, if the community must be held together by shared ethical\nvalues.\n\nPeer review and replication are methods the scientific community,\nindeed the research world in general, employs to assure consumers of\nscientific research that the work is credible. Peer review both of\nresearch proposals and of research reports submitted for publication\nscreens for quality, which includes methodological competence and\nappropriateness as well as for originality and significance, while\nreplication is intended to probe the robustness of results when\nreported experiments are carried out in different laboratories and\nwith slight changes to experimental conditions. Scholars of peer\nreview have noted various forms of bias entering into the peer review\nprocess. In a review of the literature, Lee, Sugimoto, Zhang, and\nCronin (2013) report documented bias along gender, language,\nnationality, prestige, and content as well as such problems as lack of\ninter-reviewer reliability consistency, confirmation bias, and\nreviewer conservatism. Lee (2012) argues that a Kuhnian perspective on\nvalues in science interprets lack of inter-reviewer consistency as\nvariation in interpretation, applicability, and weight assigned to\nshared values by different members of the scientific community. Lee\nand colleagues (2013) argue that journal editors must take much more\naction than is currently taken to require that researchers make their\nraw data and other relevant trial information available to enable peer\nreviewers to conduct their work adequately.\n\nOne issue that has yet to be addressed by philosophers is the gap\nbetween the ideal of replication resulting in confirmation,\nmodification, or retraction and the reality. This ideal lies behind\nthe assumptions of efficacy of structures of reward and sanction. Only\nif researchers believe that their research reports will be probed by\nefforts at replication will the threat of sanctions against faulty or\nfraudulent research be realistic. John Ioannidis and collaborators\n(Tatsioni, Bonitsis, and Ioannidis 2007; Young, N.S. Ioannidis, and\nAl-Ubaydli 2008) have shown how infrequently attempts to replicate are\nactually made and, even more strikingly, how contradicted results\npersist in the literature. This is an issue that goes beyond\nindividuals and beyond large research collaborators to the scientific\ncommunity in general. It underscores Wilholt\u2019s contention that\nthe scientific community must be held together by bonds of trust, but\nmuch more empirical and philosophical work is needed to address how to\nproceed when such trust is not justified. The demonstration of\nwidespread lack of replicability on studies in psychology and in\nbiomedical research has prompted debate about the causes and the\nseriousness of the alleged crisis (Loken and Gelman 2017; Ioannidis\n2007; Redish, Kummerfeld, Morris, and Love 2018).\n\nWinsberg, Huebner, and Kukla (2013) draw attention to a different kind\nof supra-empirical, ethical issue raised by the contemporary situation\nof multiple authorship. What they call \u201cradically collaborative\nresearch\u201d involves investigators with different forms of\nexpertise, as in Hardwig\u2019s example, and as is now common across\nmany fields, collaborating to generate an experimental result. For\nWinsberg, Huebner, and Kukla, the question is not merely reliability,\nbut accountability. Who can speak for the integrity of the research\nwhen it has been conducted by researchers with a variety not just of\ninterests, but of methodological standards, most opaque one to\nanother? Winsberg, Huebner, and Kukla argue that a model of the social\ncollaboration is needed as much as a model of the data or of the\ninstruments. They argue further that the laissez-faire Wisdom of\nCrowds model (according to which local differences in methodological\nstandards will cancel each other out), while perhaps adequate if the\nquestion is one of reliability, is not adequate for addressing these\nissues of accountability. They do not themselves, however, offer an\nalternative model.\n",
