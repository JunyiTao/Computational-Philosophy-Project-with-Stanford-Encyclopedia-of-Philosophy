    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Nonexistent Objects: From Nonexistence to Abstractness || Nuclear and Extranuclear Properties\n5.4 Nuclear and Extranuclear Properties\n\nAccording to the nuclear-extranuclear strategy, there are two kinds of\nproperties: nuclear and extranuclear ones. (Meinong 1972,\n \u00a725)[29]\n An object\u2019s nuclear properties are supposed to constitute the\nobject\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d, while its extranuclear properties\nare supposed to be external to the object\u2019s nature. Nuclear\nproperties are, for instance: being blue, being tall, kicking\nSocrates, having been kicked by Socrates, kicking somebody, being\ngolden, being a mountain (Parsons 1980, 23).\n\nWhich properties are extranuclear? Terence Parsons distinguishes four\ncategories of \u201cextranuclear predicates\u201d (i.e., predicates\nthat stand for extranuclear properties): ontological\n(\u201cexists\u201d, \u201cis mythical\u201d, \u201cis\nfictional\u201d), modal (\u201cis possible\u201d, \u201cis\nimpossible\u201d), intentional (\u201cis thought about by\nMeinong\u201d, \u201cis worshipped by someone\u201d), technical\n(\u201cis complete\u201d) (Parsons 1980,\n 23).[30]\n\nNuclear properties are either constitutive or\nconsecutive, in Meinong\u2019s terms (Meinong 1972, 176). An\nobject\u2019s constitutive properties are those properties that are\nmentioned explicitly in a description that is used to pick out the\nobject. Thus, the constitutive properties of the golden mountain are\nbeing golden and being a mountain. An object\u2019s consecutive\nproperties are those properties that are somehow included or implied\nby the object\u2019s constitutive properties. Thus, among the\nconsecutive properties of the golden mountain are probably the\nproperties of being a material thing and of being extended.\n\nAccording to MOT\\(^o\\), the object called \u201cthe golden\nmountain\u201d was \\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = G \\vee F = M)\\), i.e.,\nthe object that has the property of being golden and the property of\nbeing a mountain (and no other properties). According to the revised\nversion of object theory, the object called \u201cthe golden\nmountain\u201d is the object that has all the nuclear properties that\nare implied by the nuclear property of being golden and the nuclear\nproperty of being a mountain, i.e.,\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F^n (F^n x \\equiv G^n \\Rightarrow F^n \\vee\nM^n \\Rightarrow F^n)\\).[31]\n\nHow does the nuclear-extranuclear distinction help to avoid the\nparadoxes mentioned in the section above? \u2014 Consider again the\nparadox from incompleteness: According to MOT\\(^o\\), there is an\nobject that has the property of being blue as its sole property\n(we\u2019ve called it \u201cthe object blue\u201d, for\nshort), in logical notation:\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = B)\\). It seems to be true of the object blue, by\ndefinition, that it has exactly one property. Yet, the property\nof having exactly one property is clearly distinct from the property\nof being blue. Thus, it seems that the object blue has at\nleast two properties.\n\nAccording to the revised version of object theory with the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction (MOT\\(^{ne}\\), for short), this\nparadox is avoided in the following way: The property of being blue is\na nuclear (constitutive) property, the property of having exactly one\nproperty, however, is an extranuclear property. There\naren\u2019t any objects that have exactly one property. There are\nonly objects that have exactly one constitutive (nuclear)\nproperty. Objects that have only a limited number of constitutive\nproperties may (and necessarily do) have additional extranuclear\nproperties\u2014like the property of having exactly \\(n\\)\nconstitutive properties or the property of being incomplete. The\nobject called \u201cblue\u201d is\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F^n(F^n x \\equiv B^n \\Rightarrow F^n\\)), i.e.,\nthe object that has the property of being blue as its sole\nconstitutive property. This does not rule out that the object\nblue may have additional extranuclear properties.\nThus, the paradox from incompleteness does not arise in\n MOT\\(^{ne}\\).[32]\n\nTo Russell\u2019s objection that the existent golden mountain\ninfringes the law of contradiction (since it is both existent and\nnonexistent), advocates of MOT\\(^{ne}\\) may reply as follows:\nExistence is an extranuclear property, but only nuclear properties can\nbe constitutive properties of an object. Therefore, according to\nMOT\\(^{ne}\\), there simply is no such object as\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = G \\vee F = M \\vee F = \\rE!)\\)\n(i.e., the existent golden mountain). (This route is taken by Dale\nJacquette and Richard Routley. See Jacquette 1996, 81 and Routley\n1980, 496.)\n\nThis solution, however, imposes quite a heavy restriction on the\ntheory of objects. Probably this was the reason why Meinong himself\ndid not even mention it as a possible solution. Instead, he introduced\nin addition to the nuclear-extranuclear distinction the doctrine\nof watered-down extranuclear properties: at least some\nextranuclear properties (existence, possibility) have nuclear\ncounterparts, i.e., \u201cwatered-down\u201d versions of\nextranuclear properties (Meinong 1972,\n \u00a737).[33]\n\nIf the extranuclear property of existence has a watered-down nuclear\ncounterpart, the following answer to Russell\u2019s objection is\navailable: \u201cThe existent golden mountain exists\u201d is\nambiguous. It may be read as \u201cThe existent golden mountain\nexemplifies extranuclear existence\u201d (which is false), or it may\nbe read as \u201cThe existent golden mountain exemplifies nuclear\nexistence\u201d (which is true). There is no contradiction between\n\u201cThe existent golden mountain exemplifies nuclear\nexistence\u201d and \u201cThe existent golden mountain does not\nexist\u201d (in the proper, extranuclear sense).\n\nDo other extranuclear properties (besides existence) also have nuclear\ncounterparts? Do perhaps all extranuclear properties have\nnuclear counterparts? Meinong himself is not explicit about this\npoint, but it seems very natural to extend the theory in this way.\nTerence Parsons has adopted this extension (Parsons 1980, 68), while\nDale Jacquette rejects the doctrine of watered-down extranuclear\nproperties altogether, even for existence and possibility (Jacquette\n1996, 85\u201387).\n\nThere are several paradoxes for which MOT\\(^{ne}\\) does not supply\na solution (even if it is supplemented with the doctrine of\nwatered-down extranuclear properties). It still seems that the round\nsquare infringes the law of contradiction; one still may wonder why it\nis impossible to discover round squares and golden mountains; and one\nstill may be baffled by the doctrine that nonexistent objects differ\nfrom existent ones only in that the former lack\n existence.[34]\n",
