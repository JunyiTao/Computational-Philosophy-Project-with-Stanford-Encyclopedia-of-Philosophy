    "preamble": "\n\nOperationalism is based on the intuition that we do not know the\nmeaning of a concept unless we have a method of measurement for it. It\nis commonly considered a theory of meaning which states that \u201cwe\nmean by any concept nothing more than a set of operations; the concept\nis synonymous with the corresponding set of operations\u201d\n(Bridgman 1927, 5). That drastic statement was made in The Logic\nof Modern Physics, published in 1927 by the American physicist P.\nW. Bridgman. The operationalist point of view, first expounded at\nlength in that book, initially found many advocates among practicing\nphysicists and those inspired by the tradition of American pragmatism\nor the new philosophy of logical positivism. It is highly doubtful\nthat Bridgman intended to advance a precise and universal theory of\nmeaning, or any systematic philosophical theory at all. His writings\nwere primarily \u201creflections of a\n physicist\u201d[1]\n rooted in experimental practice and aimed at articulating the\nscientific method from a first-person point of view. However, as\nBridgman\u2019s ideas gained currency they were shaped into a general\nphilosophical doctrine of \u201coperationalism\u201d or\n\u201coperationism\u201d, and in that form became very influential\nin many areas, especially in methodological debates in psychology.\nBoth in philosophy and in psychology operationalism is nowadays\ncommonly regarded as an extreme and outmoded position, but that is not\nto say that the potential of the early ideas has been exhausted.\n\nThis article has three sections, each of which serves a different aim.\nSection 1 introduces Bridgman\u2019s key ideas on operational\nanalysis, explaining their motivations and tracing the course of their\ndevelopment.

    "main_text": "\n1. Bridgman\u2019s ideas on operational analysis\n1.1 Background and motivation\n\nPercy Williams Bridgman (1882\u20131961) was a physicist at Harvard\nUniversity whose pioneering work in the physics of high pressures was\nrewarded with a Nobel Prize in\n 1946.[2]\n His chief scientific contribution was made possible by technical\nprowess: in his laboratory Bridgman created pressures nearly 100 times\nhigher than anyone else had achieved before him, and investigated the\nnovel behavior of various materials under such high pressures. But\nBridgman was placed in a predicament by his own achievements: at such\nextreme pressures, all previously known pressure gauges broke down;\nhow was he even to know what levels of pressure he had in fact\nreached? (see Kemble, Birch and Holton 1970) As he kept breaking his\nown pressure records, Bridgman had to establish a succession of new\nmeasures fit for higher and higher pressures. Therefore it is no\nsurprise that he thought seriously about the groundlessness of\nconcepts where no methods were available for their measurement.\n\nAnother important stimulus to his philosophical thinking was his\nencounter with the revolutionary new physics of the early 20th\ncentury. Bridgman\u2019s concerns about the definition and meaning of\nscientific concepts were forged in the general climate of shock\nsuffered by physicists at that time from a barrage of phenomena and\ntheoretical ideas that were entirely alien to everyday expectations,\nculminating with quantum mechanics and its \u201cCopenhagen\u201d\ninterpretation. In a popular article, Bridgman wrote: \u201cif we\nsufficiently extend our range we shall find that nature is\nintrinsically and in its elements neither understandable nor subject\nto law\u201d (1929, 444).\n\nEspecially important for Bridgman\u2019s thinking was Albert\nEinstein\u2019s special theory of relativity. Bridgman credited an\nunexpected teaching assignment in 1914 for his first real encounter\nwith special relativity, which gave him considerable distress as he\ntried to clarify the confusing conceptual situation surrounding the\ntheory (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 76). At the heart of special\nrelativity was Einstein\u2019s recognition that judging the\nsimultaneity of two events separated in space required a different\noperation from that required for judging the simultaneity of two\nevents happening at the same place. Fixing the latter operation was\nnot sufficient to fix the former, so a further convention was\nnecessary, which Einstein supplied in the form of his operation of\nsending light beams from each of the events in question to the\nmidpoint between their locations, to see if they arrive there at the\nsame time. How superior this way of thinking was, compared to Isaac\nNewton\u2019s declaration that he would \u201cnot define Time,\nSpace, Place or Motion, as being well known to all\u201d (quoted in\nBridgman 1927, 4)! Bridgman felt that all physicists, including\nhimself, had been guilty of unthinking uses of concepts, especially on\nthe theoretical side of physics.\n\nBridgman\u2019s sentiment arising out of these reflections, however,\nwas not the familiar one of happy celebration of Einstein\u2019s\ngenius. He rather regretted the sorry state of physics which had\nnecessitated Einstein\u2019s revolution. Einstein showed what\ndangerous traps we could fall into by stepping into new domains with\nold concepts in an unreflective way. Anyone thinking in operational\nterms would have recognized from the start that the meaning of\n\u201cdistant simultaneity\u201d was not fixed unless an operation\nfor judging it was specified (Bridgman 1927, 10\u201316). In\nBridgman\u2019s view, Einstein\u2019s revolution would never have\nbeen necessary, if classical physicists had paid operational attention\nto what they were doing. He thought that any future toppling of\nunsound structures would become unnecessary if the operational way of\nthinking could quietly prevent such unsound structures in the first\nplace. Operational awareness was required if physics was not to be\ncaught off-guard again as it had been in 1905: \u201cWe must remain\naware of these joints in our conceptual structure if we hope to render\nunnecessary the services of the unborn Einsteins\u201d (Bridgman\n1927, 24).\n\nBridgman\u2019s impulse was to specify every possible detail of his\noperations, because any detail could make an important\ndifference. Note the following passage, inspired by the shock of\nlearning from the special theory of relativity that the measured\nlength of an object was not independent of its velocity:\n\nNow suppose we have to measure a moving street car. The simplest, and\nwhat we may call the \u201cna\u00efve\u201d procedure, is to board\nthe car with our meter stick and repeat the operations we would apply\nto a stationary body. Notice that this procedure reduces to that\nalready adopted in the limiting case when the velocity of the street\ncar vanishes. But here there may be new questions of detail. How\nshall we jump on to the car with our stick in hand? Shall we run\nand jump on from behind, or shall we let it pick us up in front? Or\nperhaps does now the material of which the stick is composed make a\ndifference, although previously it did not? All these questions must\nbe answered by experiment. (Bridgman 1927, 11; emphasis added)\n\n1.2 Length as the showcase of operational analysis\n\nBridgman found that the challenges of the unknown were amply present\neven in very prosaic circumstances. Therefore he chose to open his\ndiscussion of operational analysis in The Logic of Modern\nPhysics (Bridgman 1927) with the example of the most mundane of\nall scientific concepts: length. He was both fascinated and troubled\nby the fact that \u201cessential physical limitations\u201d forced\nscientists to use different measurement operations for the same\nconcept in different domains of phenomena. Length is measured with a\nruler only when we are dealing with dimensions that are comparable to\nour human bodies, and when the objects of measurement are moving\nslowly relative to the measurer. To measure, say, the distance to the\nmoon, we need to infer it from the amount of time that light takes to\ntravel that distance and return, and that is also the procedure taken\nup in Einstein\u2019s theorizing in special relativity; \u201cthe\nspace of astronomy is not a physical space of meter sticks, but is a\nspace of light waves\u201d (Bridgman 1927, 67). For even larger\ndistances we use the unit of \u201clight-year,\u201d but we cannot\nactually use the operation of sending off a light beam to a distant\nspeck of light in the sky and waiting for years on end until hopefully\na reflected signal comes back to us (or our descendants). Much more\ncomplex reasoning and operations are required for measuring any\ndistances beyond the solar system:\n\nThus at greater and greater distances not only does experimental\naccuracy become less, but the very nature of the operations by which\nlength is to be determined becomes indefinite\u2026. To say that a\ncertain star is 105 light years distant is actually and\nconceptually an entire different kind of thing from saying\nthat a certain goal post is 100 meters distant. (Bridgman 1927,\n17\u201318; emphasis original)\n\n\nThus operational analysis reveals that length is not one homogeneous\nconcept that applies straightforwardly in the whole range of cases in\nwhich we use it:\n\nIn principle the operations by which length is measured\nshould be uniquely specified. If we have more than one set of\noperations, we have more than one concept, and strictly there should\nbe a separate name to correspond to each different set of operations.\n(Bridgman 1927, 10; emphases original)\n\n\nIn practice scientists do not recognize multiple concepts of length,\nand Bridgman was willing to concede that it was allowable to use the\nsame name to represent a series of concepts, if the different\nmeasurement operations gave mutually consistent numerical results in\nthe areas of overlap:\n\nIf we deal with phenomena outside the domain in which we originally\ndefined our concepts, we may find physical hindrances to performing\nthe operations of the original definition, so that the original\noperations have to be replaced by others. These new operations are, of\ncourse, to be so chosen that they give, within experimental error, the\nsame numerical results in the domain in which the two sets of\noperations may be both applied. (Bridgman 1927, 23)\n\n\nHowever, such numerical convergence between the results of two\ndifferent operations was regarded by Bridgman as merely a\n\u201cpractical justification for retaining the same name\u201d for\nwhat the two operations measured (Bridgman 1927, 16).\n\nEven in such convergent situations, we have to be wary of the danger\nof slipping into conceptual confusion through the use of the same word\nto refer to the subjects of different operations. If we do not temper\nour thoughts with the operationalist conscience always referring us\nback to concrete measurement operations, we may get into the sloppy\nhabit of using one word for all sorts of different situations (without\neven checking for the required convergence in the overlapping\ndomains). Bridgman warned: \u201cour verbal machinery has no built-in\ncutoff\u201d (1959a, 75). Similarly we could be misled by the\nrepresentation of a concept as a number into thinking that there is\nnaturally an infinitely extendable scale for that concept, since the\nreal-number line continues on to infinity. It would also be easy to\nthink that physical quantities must meaningfully exist down to\ninfinite precision, just because the numerical scale we have pinned on\nthem is infinitely divisible. Bridgman issued a stark reminder:\n\nMathematics does not recognize that as the physical range increases,\nthe fundamental concepts become hazy, and eventually cease entirely to\nhave physical meaning, and therefore must be replaced by other\nconcepts which are operationally quite different. For instance, the\nequations of motion make no distinction between the motion of a star\ninto our galaxy from external space, and the motion of an electron\nabout the nucleus, although physically the meaning in terms of\noperations of the quantities in the equations is entirely different in\nthe two cases. The structure of our mathematics is such that we are\nalmost forced, whether we want to or not, to talk about the inside of\nan electron, although physically we cannot assign any meaning to such\nstatements. (Bridgman 1927, 63)\n\n\nBridgman thus emphasized that our concepts did not automatically\nextend beyond the domains in which they were originally defined. He\nwarned that concepts in far-out domains could easily become\nmeaningless for lack of applicable measurement operations. The case of\nlength in the very small scale makes that danger clear. Beyond the\nresolution of the eye, the ruler has to be given up in favor of\nvarious micrometers and microscopes. When we get to the realm of atoms\nand elementary particles, it is not clear what operations could be\nused to measure length, and not even clear what \u201clength\u201d\nmeans any more.\n1.3 Critique of other physical concepts\n\nAfter introducing operational analysis with that refreshing discussion\nof the length concept, Bridgman published a long series of critical\nre-assessments of various fundamental physical concepts. His\nruminations on length were extended into general commentary on the\nnature of space, and the concept of time received a similar treatment.\nHis views on space and time were reminiscent of Henri\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s and Pierre Duhem\u2019s: Bridgman noted that\nclocks had to be used in the empirical determination of the basic laws\nof physics, while our confidence that a clock ticks regularly was\nfounded in the basic laws of physics governing its mechanism. Suppose\nwe are trying to test the general theory of relativity by measuring\nthe red-shift of light coming out of a heavy body:\n\nIf the vibrating atom is a clock, then the light of the sun is shifted\ntoward the infra-red, but how do we know that the atom is a clock\n(some say yes, others no)? If we find the displacement physically have\nwe thereby proved that general relativity is physically true, or have\nwe proved that the atom is a clock, or have we merely proved that\nthere is a particular kind of connection between the atom and the rest\nof nature, leaving the possibility open that neither is the atom a\nclock nor general relativity true? (Bridgman 1927, 72\u201373)\n\n\nBridgman found these reflections liberating as well as troubling.\nBasic space-time concepts are not uniquely determined a\npriori. For example, he noted that the notion of velocity common\nto classical mechanics and special relativity was not the only one in\nline with our intuitions of what velocity meant. Consider this\nalternative: \u201ca traveler in an automobile measures his velocity\nby observing the clock on his instrument board and the mile stones\nwhich he passes on the road.\u201d If we adopt such a procedure we\nwill find that the speed of light is infinite, if special relativity\nis correct about time dilation: with the car going at the speed of\nlight according to an observer standing on the road, the clock on the\ncar will not advance at all while the car passes any number of\nmilestones. This alternative concept of velocity would have the\nadvantage that \u201cthere would be no limit to the velocity which\ncan be imparted to material bodies on giving them unlimited\nenergy\u201d, which seems intuitively \u201cnatural and\nsimple\u201d. But assigning an infinite velocity to light is also\n\u201cmost unnatural, particularly if we favor a medium point of\nview.\u201d So there was a dilemma: \u201call sorts of phenomena\ncannot at the same time be treated simply.\u201d (Bridgman 1927,\n98\u2013100)\n\nIn the latter parts of The Logic of Modern Physics Bridgman\ngave a fascinating array of discussions on the concepts of force,\nmass, energy, light and field, and the theories of thermodynamics,\nrelativity and quantum mechanics. These thoughts were developed\nfurther in the remaining decades of his life, and collected in\nsubsequent volumes including The Nature of Physical Theory\n(1936), The Nature of Thermodynamics (1941), Reflections\nof a Physicist (1950, second edition 1955), The Nature of\nSome of Our Physical Concepts (1952), and The Way Things\nAre (1959a). Bridgman made a searching examination of the\nfamiliar concepts of classical physics, checking to see if they\nretained operational meaning in domains of phenomena that were\nunfamiliar to the creators of classical physics. In some cases his\nanalysis showed that the classical concepts were operationally unsound\neven in the contexts in which they were originally created. Later in\nlife he stated that his initial foray into philosophy was motivated by\nhis \u201cdisquietude\u201d about physics, especially\nelectrodynamics and thermodynamics, in which \u201cthe fundamental\nunderstanding of even the acknowledged leaders in physics were\ninadequate\u201d (Bridgman 1959b, 519). In contrast, he thought that\non the whole the contemporary development of quantum theory went in\nthe right direction, especially in Werner Heisenberg\u2019s version\nof it, which discarded classical concepts where they did not apply\n(e.g., space-time orbits for electrons), and crafted new concepts with\nclear operational meaning in new domains of phenomena. However, he was\nnot entirely satisfied with Niels Bohr\u2019s doctrine that all the\noperations of physics needed to be explained in the \u201cmacroscopic\nlanguage of daily life or of present-day philosophy\u201d; rather, he\nthought we needed to develop a \u201cmore adequate macroscopic\nlanguage\u201d (1959b, 526).\n\nInterestingly, Bridgman never stopped thinking about relativity. The\noperationalist lesson he had taken from Einstein was so dear to him\nthat he did not shrink from criticizing Einstein himself when the\nlatter seemed to betray his own principles in the general theory of\nrelativity. Already in The Logic of Modern Physics he had\nopined: \u201cI personally question whether the elements of\nEinstein\u2019s formulation, such as curvature of space-time, are\nclosely enough connected with immediate physical experience ever to be\naccepted as an ultimate in a scheme of explanation, and I very much\nfeel the need for a formulation in more intimate physical terms\u201d\n(1927, 176). Years later, when Bridgman was invited by P. A. Schilpp\nto contribute to the Library of Living Philosophers volume on\nEinstein, he issued the following \u201cindictment\u201d against\nEinstein: \u201che has carried into general relativity theory\nprecisely that uncritical, pre-Einsteinian point of view which he has\nso convincingly shown us, in his special theory, conceals the\npossibility of disaster\u201d (Bridgman 1949a, 354; reprinted in\nBridgman 1955, 337). Einstein brushed aside Bridgman\u2019s\nobjection, merely stating that for a formal system to qualify as a\nphysical theory it was \u201cnot necessary to demand that all of its\nassertions can be independently interpreted and \u2018tested\u2019\n\u2018operationally\u2019\u201d (Einstein in Schilpp 1949, 679).\nThis exchange is reminiscent of how Einstein responded with bemused\nincomprehension to Heisenberg\u2019s protest that he was following\nEinstein\u2019s own lesson in treating only directly observable\nquantities in his matrix mechanics (Heisenberg 1971, 62\u201369).\nBridgman also carried out further operational analysis of special\nrelativity, and his late thoughts on the subject were published\nposthumously in A Sophisticate\u2019s Primer on Relativity\n(1962).\n\nBridgman\u2019s critique of concepts in physics also led naturally to\na philosophical critique of some general conceptions underlying\nphysics, such as simplicity, atomism, causality, determinism, and\nprobability. He also gave critical considerations to mathematics and\nits application to the physical world. There was no stone Bridgman was\nwilling to leave unturned in his relentless critique. He went as far\nas to declare: \u201carithmetic, so far as it purports to deal with\nactual physical objects, is also affected with the same penumbra of\nuncertainty as all other empirical science\u201d (Bridgman 1927,\n34).\n\nAmong physicists Bridgman\u2019s reflections found a strong echo,\nespecially in the early days. Perhaps that was natural: it has been\nsaid, by Bridgman himself too, that operationalism arose from\nobserving \u201cphysicists in action\u201d (Bridgman in Frank 1956,\n80). Gerald Holton (1995a, 224) recalls what an \u201celectrifying\nexperience\u201d it was for himself and many other physicists to read\nThe Logic of Modern Physics for the first time, but explains\nthat the \u201cimmense power\u201d of Bridgman\u2019s work is\n\u201cnot that the work brings to the reader a message never thought\nof before, but that it lays open, with clarity, what the reader has\nbeen trying to formulate on his or her own\u201d. In Mary\nHesse\u2019s view Bridgman only gave \u201cthe most explicit\nformulation\u201d of a common view, which was shared even by Arthur\nEddington, whose metaphysical musings about physics Bridgman took a\nstrong exception to: \u201cA physical quantity is defined by the\nseries of operations and calculations of which it is the result\u201d\n(quoted in Hesse 1952, 218).\n\nBridgman\u2019s philosophical views, however, were not just an\narticulation of views widely shared by physicists. Albert E. Moyer\n(1991) stresses that Bridgman\u2019s operational analysis served the\nfunction of making special relativity and quantum mechanics more\npalatable by showing how they could be understood in a way that most\nphysicists could cope with. But the operational way of rendering the\nnew physics was not agreeable to all physicists (or philosophers of\nphysics), although it was consonant with the stances taken by some\nleaders in the field including Bohr, Heisenberg and Oppenheimer (Moyer\n1991, 376, 389). We have already seen Einstein\u2019s objections to\nBridgman\u2019s interpretation of relativity. Mario Bunge (1988)\nargues that operationalism is \u201cwritten into the standard (or\nCopenhagen) interpretation of the quantum theory\u201d, but that this\ninterpretation gives a clear misrepresentation of the actual practices\nin quantum physics. Analyzing Dirac\u2019s version of the theory,\nHesse (1952) concluded that concepts of quantum theory did not have\nsimple operational meanings, and Dirac\u2019s\n\u201cobservables\u201d were concepts without operational\ndefinitions. Rather, in Hesse\u2019s view, concepts in such\nsituations only derived their meanings from theoretical analogies.\n1.4 Implications outside physics\n\nBridgman also extended his operationalist thinking by considering its\nimplications outside physics. This was important to him at least from\nthe time of The Logic of Modern Physics, in which he\nventured: \u201cmany of the questions asked about social and\nphilosophical subjects will be found to be meaningless when examined\nfrom the point of operations. It would doubtless conduce greatly to\nclarity of thought if the operational mode of thinking were adopted in\nall fields of inquiry as well as in the physical\u201d (30\u201332).\nTo Bridgman it was clear that \u201cto adopt the operational point of\nview \u2026 means a far-reaching change in all our habits of\nthought\u201d. He knew that in practice this would be a very\ndifficult thing to do: \u201cOperational thinking will at first prove\nto be an unsocial virtue; one will find oneself perpetually unable to\nunderstand the simplest conversation of one\u2019s friends, and will\nmake oneself universally unpopular by demanding the meaning of\napparently the simplest terms of every argument\u201d. Perhaps this\nthrowaway remark was a sign of things to come, as Bridgman would in\nthe end find himself rather isolated and plagued by misunderstanding,\neven among those who found his philosophical ideas worth discussing,\nas we will see in Section 2.\n\nBridgman did not develop in detail his operationalist ideas in\nrelation to any other science than physics, apparently content to\nleave that job to the specialists in the respective fields. Some other\nscientists and philosophers did take up Bridgman\u2019s call for\noperationalist reforms, with interesting consequences. Now, it would\nbe fair to say that operationalism did not change the practice of\nphysics itself drastically from what it would have been anyway, and\nmost physicists followed him only as far as he asserted what was\ncommon sense to them. The situation was perhaps similar in other\nphysical sciences, too. For example, operational thinking has always\nbeen an important part of chemistry, sometimes explicitly so, for\nexample in Lavoisier\u2019s famous \u201coperational\u201d\ndefinition of a chemical element as a substance that has not yet been\ndecomposed further. David Hull (1968) indicates that some key terms in\nbiology has been criticised for not being operational, and calls for a\nnuanced view on the matter. Hugh Petrie (1971) laments that a\npositivist dogma originating from a misunderstanding of operationalism\nhas had a negative influence on the social sciences. Moyer (1991,\n393\u2013394) records Bridgman\u2019s influence on the University of\nChicago economist Henry Schultz, and the strong and explicit\noperationalist orientation of Paul Samuelson\u2019s early work. Paul\nMarshall (1979) argues, with particular attention to political\nscience, that operationalism has left a methodological legacy in the\nsocial sciences lasting well beyond its decline within the philosophy\nof science.\n\nThe field that was most significantly and expressly affected by\noperationalism was psychology. Behaviorist psychologists took up\noperationalism (or operationism, as it was more often called\nin psychology) as a weapon in their fight against more traditional\npsychologists, especially those who prized introspection as the most\nimportant source of psychological knowledge. The Harvard psychologist\nEdwin Boring (1886\u20131968) saw Bridgman\u2019s philosophy as a\nmodern substitute for positivism, and he seems to have coined the term\n\u201coperationism\u201d (see Walter 1990, 178). It was\nBoring\u2019s student Stanley Smith Stevens (1906\u20131973) who was\nperhaps the most aggressive promoter of operationism in psychology\n(Hardcastle 1994; Feest 2005). Stevens saw operationism as a sure\nmethod of increasing rigor in psychological experiments and discourse,\nasserting that \u201cto experience is, for the purpose of science, to\nreact discriminately\u201d, since these reactions are what science\ncan measure and record publicly (quoted in Feest 2005, 136). Echoing\nBridgman\u2019s take on Einstein, Stevens declared in 1935:\n\u201cThe revolution that will put an end to the possibility of\nrevolutions is the one that defines a straightforward procedure for\nthe definition and validation of concepts. \u2026 Such a procedure\nis the one which tests the meaning of concepts by appealing to the\nconcrete operations by which the concept is determined. We may call it\noperationism\u201d (quoted in Walter 1990, 180).\n\nIn his concrete research in psychology Stevens focused on\npsychophysics, starting with his Ph.D. dissertation on the perceived\nattributes of tones, written under Boring\u2019s supervision. Another\nnotable operationist in psychology was Edward Chace Tolman\n(1886\u20131959), also a Harvard Ph.D., who taught for most of his\nlife at the University of California at Berkeley. Starting with his\nresearch on problem-solving behavior in rats, Tolman gave an\noperational treatment of desire, for example operationalizing hunger\nin terms of \u201ctime since last feeding\u201d. Tolman did not deny\nthat hunger was a subjective feeling, nor was it the main object of\nhis research, but insisted that controlling for degrees of hunger in\nhis experiments required tractable operations that would allow\nscientists to get a hold on something related to that subjective\nexperience (see Feest 2005, 136\u2013138). In Gustav Bergmann\u2019s\nassessment, operationism helped behaviorism to move from its initial\nmetaphysical Watsonian variety to its modern version (Bergmann in\nFrank 1956, 53).\n\nDespite the strong popularity of operationist behaviorism in certain\nquarters, it never commanded a complete consensus even in American\npsychology. Perhaps the most unexpected opposition came from Bridgman\nhimself. Behaviorists were wanting to use operations to attain\nobjectivity in psychology, which for them meant taking psychological\ndiscourse away from attempts to describe private experience. This was\njust the wrong move in Bridgman\u2019s view, as we will see in more\ndetail in Section 2.4 below. Bridgman engaged in some discussion with\nStevens but discovered that the latter\u2019s enthusiasm for\n\u201coperational ideas\u201d was really for something that he could\nnot agree with. By 1936 he declared privately: \u201cI have rather\nwashed my hands of him\u201d (quoted in Walter 1990, 184).\nBridgman\u2019s disagreement with B. F. Skinner (1904\u20131990) was\neven more severe, and resulted in a prolonged dispute between the two\n(Holton 2005; Walter 1990, 188\u2013192). Operationism became a\nsubject of great controversy in psychology, epitomized in a 1945\nspecial issue of the Psychological Review devoted to a\nsymposium on operationism suggested by Boring, who remained supportive\nof the movement at some critical distance.\n\nUljana Feest considers that operationism did leave a lasting and\npositive legacy in psychology. The maxim of operationism dictates that\npsychologists should provide concepts with operational definitions by\nspecifying paradigmatic experimental conditions for their application,\nand this remains a useful methodological tenet (Feest 2011, 403). In\nFeest\u2019s view a sufficiently sophisticated understanding of\noperationism in psychology was only reached by the second generation\nof operationists, who consciously employed what she calls the\nmethodological (rather than positivist) reading of operationism.\nFeest\u2019s analysis reinforces R. C. Grace\u2019s (2001)\nview that the early operationist psychologists made the mistake of\nadopting a very restrictive version of Bridgman\u2019s ideas, but\nthat this mistake was corrected in the 1950s with the adoption of\n\u201cmultiple\u201d or \u201cconvergent\u201d operationism. These\nsophisticated operationists did not take operational definitions to\ngive full and fixed meanings of concepts, but used them as provisional\ntools aiding their scientific investigations. As Feest puts it:\n\u201cI believe that in offering operational definitions, scientists\nwere partially and temporarily specifying their usage of\ncertain concepts by saying which kinds of empirical indicators they\ntook to be indicative of the referents of the\nconcepts.\u201d(Feest 2005, 133; emphases original)\n2. Critiques of operationalism\n\nDespite the initial popularity of Bridgman\u2019s ideas, by the\nmiddle of the 20th century the common reactions among philosophers and\nphilosophically-minded scientists were strongly critical.\nOperationalism received many high-profile debates, among them a\nsymposium held at the annual meeting of the American Association for\nthe Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 1953 (published in Frank 1956),\nand the Psychological Review issue mentioned above. On such\noccasions Bridgman attempted to refine and defend his views, but also\nfound that the debate was moving in directions that both surprised and\ndisturbed him. In his contribution to the AAAS symposium he\nexclaimed:\n\nThere would seem to be no reason why I am better fitted than anyone\nelse to open this discussion. As I listened to the papers I felt that\nI have only a historical connection with this thing called\n\u201coperationalism.\u201d In short, I feel that I have created a\nFrankenstein, which has certainly got away from me. I abhor the word\noperationalism or operationism, which seems to imply\na dogma, or at least a thesis of some kind. The thing I have envisaged\nis too simple to be dignified by so pretentious a name. (Bridgman in\nFrank 1956, 75\u201376)\n\n\nStill, arguably it was not Bridgman\u2019s own ideas about\noperational analysis but the Frankenstein of operationalism that had a\nmore significant impact in philosophy and science, so this survey of\noperationalism must deal with how other people responded to\noperationalism as they saw it. In the course of the discussion I will\ntry to point out some places where there were clear misunderstandings\nof Bridgman\u2019s ideas, and also other places where Bridgman\nhimself was ambivalent or ambiguous, rather than simply\nmisunderstood.\n\nGiven the timing and contexts of the publication of Bridgman\u2019s\nideas, the philosophical debates surrounding them were to a large\nextent framed in relation to logical positivism, which was just making\nits big impact on the American philosophical scene. The young Herbert\nFeigl (1902\u20131988), with a personal introduction by no less than\nMoritz Schlick, came to Harvard in 1930 with the express purpose of\nlearning from Bridgman, despite the latter\u2019s warning that he did\nnot have much to teach (Walter 1990, 164\u2013165; Moyer 1991, 391).\nBridgman\u2019s insistence on operational meaningfulness had at least\na surface resemblance to the logical positivists\u2019 verification\ntheory of meaning. Bergmann thought Bridgman had given a\n\u201cscientist\u2019s version\u201d of the latter (Bergmann in\nFrank 1956, 55), and Carl Hempel regarded operationalism and logical\npositivism as \u201cclosely akin\u201d to each other (Hempel in\nFrank 1956, 56). And it is not difficult to see how a kindred\nphilosophical doctrine coming from a world-class scientist would have\ncaptured the logical positivists\u2019 imagination.\n\nWhen subjected to the scrutiny of professional philosophers, however,\nBridgman\u2019s ideas were soon exposed as unsystematic and\nundeveloped, as he freely admitted himself. Moreover, it became\nevident that his ideas did not help logical positivists solve the key\nproblems that they were struggling with. After the initial\nfascination, the standard positivist (and post-positivist) reaction to\noperationalism was disappointment, and operationalism was often seen\nas a failed philosophy that did not live up to its promises.\n2.1 Operational definitions do not exhaust meaning\n\nNowhere was the positivist disappointment with Bridgman sharper than\nin considerations of operationalism as a theory of meaning. There was\na set of objections which together amounted to a complaint that\noperational definitions did not give a sufficient account of the\nmeaning of concepts, even where there were operations clearly relevant\nto the concepts in question.\n\nThe core of the problem here is an overly restrictive notion of\nmeaning, which reduces it to measurement; I will call this\nBridgman\u2019s reductive doctrine of meaning. Although\nBridgman was not proposing a general philosophical theory of meaning,\nhe did make remarks that revealed an impulse to do so. Consider the\nfollowing statement, the last part of which I have already quoted:\n\nWe evidently know what we mean by length if we can tell what the\nlength of any and every object is, and for the physicist nothing more\nis required. To find the length of an object, we have to perform\ncertain physical operations. The concept of length is therefore fixed\nwhen the operations by which length is measured are fixed: that is,\nthe concept of length involves as much as and nothing more than the\nset of operations by which length is determined. In general, we mean\nby any concept nothing more than a set of operations; the concept is\nsynonymous with the corresponding set of operations. (Bridgman 1927,\n5)\n\n\nSimilarly, he also displayed an impulse to use operations to make a\ncriterion of meaningfulness: \u201cIf a specific question has\nmeaning, it must be possible to find operations by which an answer may\nbe given to it.\u201d (Bridgman 1927, 28)\n\nOne lesson we can take from Bridgman\u2019s troubles is that meaning\nis unruly and promiscuous. The kind of absolute control on the meaning\nof scientific concepts that Bridgman wished for is not possible. The\nmost control that can be achieved is for the scientific community to\nagree on an explicit definition and to respect it. But even firm\ndefinitions can only constrain the uses of a concept. The entire world\ncan agree to define length by the standard meter in Paris (or by the\nwavelength of a certain atomic radiation), and that still comes\nnowhere near exhausting all that we mean by length. Bridgman\nhimself later specifically admitted that his statement that meanings\nwere synonymous with operations was \u201cobviously going too far\nwhen taken out of context\u201d (1938, 117). Especially compared with\nthe notion of \u201cmeaning as use,\u201d often traced back to the\nlater phase of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s\n work,[3]\n it is easy to recognize the narrowness of Bridgman\u2019s initial\nideas. Bridgman\u2019s later gloss on his ideas was in fact rather\nlate-Wittgensteinian: \u201cTo know the meaning of a term used by me\nit is evident, I think, that I must know the conditions under which I\nwould use the term\u201d (1938, 116). As measurement operations\nprovide only one specific context in which a concept is used,\noperational definitions can only cover one particular aspect of\nmeaning.\n\nRecognizing the restrictiveness of Bridgman\u2019s early remarks on\nmeaning gives us a useful framework for understanding one common\nobjection to operationalism. As Donald Gillies (1972, 6\u20137)\nemphasizes, if we accept the most extreme kind of operationalism,\nthere is no point in asking whether a measurement method is valid; if\nthe measurement method defines the concept and there is nothing more\nto the meaning of the concept, the measurement method is automatically\nvalid, as a matter of convention or even tautology. Metrological\nvalidity becomes an interesting question only if the concept possesses\na broader meaning than the specification of the method of its\nmeasurement. Not only Bridgman himself but the second-generation\noperationist psychologists recognized this point very clearly, in\ntheir discussions of construct validity (see, for example, Cronbach\nand Meehl 1955). The measurement method can be said to be valid if it\ncoheres with the other aspects of the concept\u2019s meaning. That\nway we may also make a judgment about whether an operational\ndefinition (or any other kind of definition) is an appropriate one,\ndepending on how well it coheres with other elements of the\nconcept\u2019s meaning and how beneficially it controls other\nelements of meaning.\n2.2 Operational definitions are not required for all useful concepts\n\nSo far I have noted that an operational definition is not sufficient\nto express a concept\u2019s meaning fully. Going further than that,\nmany critics of operationalism have argued that not every good\nscientific concept needs to have an operational definition. If\noperationalism means demanding that every concept and every\ninferential step should have an immediate operational significance, it\nconstitutes an overly restrictive empiricism. At times Bridgman did\nappear to be making such a demand, as illustrated in the poignant\nepisode (discussed in Section 1.3 above) in which he criticized\nEinstein for betraying his own operationalist lesson in the general\ntheory of relativity. Einstein\u2019s view was that there was no\nreason for physicists to shrink from using a non-operational concept\nif that delivered good results.\n\nEinstein was self-consciously opportunistic in his methodological\neclecticism, but philosophers wanted to find a more general rationale\nfor freeing scientific theorizing from operationalist\nmicro-management. The crux of the problem here for the operationalist\nis that theoretical concepts are much too useful in science. Bridgman\nactually acknowledged from early on that there were good theoretical\nconcepts that were not amenable to direct operationalization,\nillustrating the point with the example of stress and strain inside a\nsolid body (1927, 53\u201354), and the wavefunction in quantum\nmechanics (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 79). Bridgman saw clearly that\nthese theoretical concepts only had indirect connections with physical\noperations, but he did not see any problems with that. He in fact went\nso far as to say: \u201cthere need be no qualms that the operational\npoint of view will ever place the slightest restriction on the freedom\nof the theoretical physicist to explore the consequences of any free\nmental construction\u201d (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 79; see also\nBridgman 1949b, 256). All that was required was that the theoretical\nsystem touched the operational ground somewhere, eventually. However,\nin that case Bridgman\u2019s message was the same as\nEinstein\u2019s, as the physicist R. B. Lindsay pointed out (Lindsay\nin Frank 1956, 71\u201372).\n\nBridgman\u2019s position on the matter of theoretical concepts was\ncomplicated, and perhaps not entirely self-consistent (I will return\nto this point in Section 3.3). One common objection to operationalism\nis based on a misunderstanding that reveals an essential difference\nbetween Bridgman and most of his critics. It is often said that\noperationalism cannot be right because each scientific concept can be\nmeasured in various ways. This criticism is based on the presumption\nthat the concept in question has unity, which means that its\ndefinition must also be unified. If there are a variety of measurement\nmethods all of which apply to one concept, then measurement methods\ncannot be what supplies the unified definition; instead, some\ntheoretical account must be given as to how the variety of operations\nunder consideration serve to measure the same thing. Bridgman, in\ncontrast, had no such presumption of conceptual unity. For him, the\ninitial position to take was that if there are different methods of\nmeasurement we have different concepts, as he said about\n\u201ctactual\u201d and \u201coptical\u201d length being two\ndifferent concepts. Now, it could be that there is one aspect\nof reality that different measurement operations all get at, but that\nis something to be demonstrated, not to be assumed at the outset. The\npossibility of unity can be entertained if the minimum condition of\nnumerical convergence is met\u2014that is, if two measurement\noperations have an overlapping range and their results agree in the\noverlap. Still, Bridgman maintained some skepticism about whether it\nwas safe for us to infer real conceptual unity from such numerical\nconvergence.\n\nBridgman\u2019s ambivalence about conceptual unity elicited a serious\nworry about the systematic import of scientific concepts and theories,\nmost astutely expressed by Hempel (1966, 91\u201397).\nBridgman\u2019s skeptical caution would result in an intolerable\nfragmentation of science, Hempel argued. It would result in \u201ca\nproliferation of concepts of length, of temperature, and of all other\nscientific concepts that would not only be practically unmanageable,\nbut theoretically endless.\u201d Hempel\u2019s worry was that\nBridgman\u2019s quest for safety was blinding him to one of the\nultimate aims of science, \u201cnamely the attainment of a simple,\nsystematically unified account of empirical phenomena\u201d (Hempel\n1966, 94). Along similar lines, Lindsay (1937, 458) had earlier argued\nthat \u201csuch an isolation of concepts would defeat the very aim of\nphysical science, which is to provide a simple and economical\ndescription\u201d of physical experience \u201cin terms of a minimum\nnumber of concepts\u201d. Bridgman had serious doubts about the\nplausibility of such a simple, unified account of nature, as I will\nexplain further in Section 3.4. But Hempel and others could genuinely\nenvisage it. Hempel noted that with the development of science there\nwas a continually growing and thickening network of \u201cnomic\nthreads\u201d linking various \u201cknot-concepts\u201d with each\nother as further empirical laws were discovered. Hempel argued that it\nwas essential to keep this thickening conceptual network systematic\nand simple; to that end, \u201cconcept formation and theory formation\nmust go hand in hand\u201d (Hempel 1966, 97). That, in turn, often\nnecessitated \u201ca modification of the operational criteria\noriginally adopted for some of the central concepts\u201d (Hempel\n1966, 95). Operationalism would stand in the way of such\nflexibility.\n2.3 What are operations?\n\nApart from the questions of whether operational definitions are\nsufficient or necessary, it is actually unclear what types of things\noperations are, and how they should be specified. This\nproblem was noted and discussed quite early on (see, for example,\nHearnshaw 1941). The surface-level intuition is simple: the operations\nthat matter are measurement operations involving physical instruments.\nBut from the start Bridgman (1927, 5) also stated that the operations\nwhich fixed meaning were mental if the concepts in question were\nmental (e.g., in mathematics). And he knew that measurement operations\ninvolved more than physical manipulations of instruments; at least\nthere are recordings and computations involved in the processing and\nanalysis of data, and there are mental acts linking various parts of\nthat complex procedure, too. To take the simplest example, the\noperation of counting is a mental operation, but it is an integral\npart of many \u201cphysical\u201d procedures. He called such crucial\nnon-physical operations \u201cpaper-and-pencil\u201d operations.\nBridgman lamented that it was the \u201cmost wide spread\nmisconception with regard to the operational technique\u201d to think\nthat it demanded that all concepts in physics must find their meaning\nonly in terms of physical operations in the laboratory (Bridgman 1938,\n122\u2013124; also Bridgman 1959b, 522). Later he gave a rough\nclassification of operations into the instrumental, mental/verbal, and\npaper-and-pencil varieties (Bridgman 1959a, 3).\n\nThis issue becomes sharper when we ask the question of purpose: what\nare the aims of operational analysis, and which operations are\nsuitable for achieving those aims? Having distinguished various types\nof operations, Bridgman also had to deal with the question of whether\nthe different types had different epistemic values, going beyond his\ninitial intuitive fondness for instrumental operations. For example,\nif the point of operationalizing a concept was to make its meaning\nclear and precise, which meant using \u201coperations which can be\nunequivocally performed\u201d (Bridgman 1938, 119), then why were\npaper-and-pencil operations such as the construction of Euclidean\ngeometric figures not just as good as instrumental operations? In the\nend he was willing to dispense with any ultimate privileging of\ninstrumental operations. But he still maintained a preference for them\nwhen possible, without giving a convincing reason for that preference\n(Bridgman 1938, 127).\n\nThus Bridgman\u2019s position on the nature and function of\noperations was uneasy from start to finish. Various critics rightly\nzeroed in on this point. The most important point of contention was\nwhether and why physical or instrumental operations had any special\nepistemic advantage. The Yale physicist Henry Margenau put the point\nsuccinctly:\n\nOperationalism is an attitude that emphasizes the need of recourse,\nwherever feasible, to instrumental procedures when meanings are to be\nestablished. Bridgman disavows its status as a philosophy, and wisely\nso, for as a general view \u2026. it cannot define the meaning of\n\u201cinstrumental procedure\u201d in a manner that saves the view\nfrom being either trivial (which would be true if\n\u201cinstrumental\u201d were construed to include symbolic, mental\nand paper-and-pencil operations) or too restrictive (if all operations\nare to be laboratory procedures). (Margenau in Frank 1956, 45)\n\n\nAs one can imagine, this dilemma also hampered attempts to use\noperational analysis in psychology. Operations in psychological\nresearch inevitably involved verbal instructions, reports and\nreactions. It was difficult to argue that these mental or verbal\noperations were superior in reliability or meaningfulness to the\nintrospective reporting of mental states, which operationists tried so\nhard to exclude from scientific psychology.\n\nBridgman himself was troubled by the question regarding the nature of\noperations and admitted late in his life that he had not really\nprovided \u201can analysis of what it is that makes an operation\nsuitable\u201d, or \u201cin what terms can operations be\nspecified\u201d (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 77). An even deeper\npessimism was expressed in Bridgman\u2019s 30-year retrospective on\nThe Logic of Modern Physics, commissioned for\nDaedalus by Holton: \u201cTo me now it seems\nincomprehensible that I should ever have thought it within my powers\n\u2026 to analyze so thoroughly the functioning of our thinking\napparatus that I could confidently expect to exhaust the subject and\neliminate the possibility of a bright new idea against which I would\nbe defenseless\u201d (Bridgman 1959b, 520).\n2.4 Are operations private or public?\n\nOne last issue needs to be mentioned, before I complete the discussion\nof the critique of operationalism: the privacy of operations. This is\nperhaps not widely remembered now, but it was the issue on which\nBridgman\u2019s position elicited the most severe incomprehension and\nobjection, even from many who called themselves operationalists.\n\nThe emblematic moment in this dispute came during the 5th\nInternational Congress for the Unity of Science in 1939, held at\nHarvard University\u2014one of the highpoints of the activities of\nthe \u201cVienna Circle in exile\u201d in America (see Holton\n1995b). Bridgman was invited to address this conference, and chose to\ngive a talk entitled \u201cScience: Public or\n Private?\u201d.[4]\n At this point it became clear that his enterprise was fundamentally\nat odds with the logical positivist project, despite the surface\nkinship:\n\nThe process that I want to call scientific is a process that involves\nthe continual apprehension of meaning, the constant appraisal of\nsignificance, accompanied by a running act of checking to be sure that\nI am doing what I want to do, and of judging correctness or\nincorrectness. This checking and judging and accepting that together\nconstitute understanding are done by me, and can be done for me by no\none else. They are as private as my toothache, and without them\nscience is dead. (Bridgman 1955, 56)\n\n\nPositivists and behaviorists had embraced operationalism for precisely\nthe opposite reason: they thought operations were public, objective\nand verifiable, unlike private experience. But Bridgman was insistent\nthat operations were a matter for private experience. He could see no\nwarrant in simply taking someone else\u2019s testimony as true or\nreliable, or in regarding the report of an operation performed by\nsomeone else as the same kind of thing as an operation performed and\nexperienced by himself. In a later paper called \u201cNew Vistas for\nIntelligence\u201d he declared: \u201cScience is not truly objective\nunless it recognizes its own subjective or individual aspects\u201d\n(Bridgman 1955, 556). As Holton puts it (2005, 74), Bridgman\u2019s\ndrive in operational analysis was \u201cto throw the spotlight on\nperformable action, above all an action performed by himself.\nUltimately, he was a private man, so much so that he was accused of\nsolipsism, to which he scarcely objected.\u201d In his epistemic\nindividualism Bridgman was perhaps only matched by Herbert Dingle, the\nfounder of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science, among\nnotable 20th-century philosophers of science (see Dingle 1950).\n\nBridgman\u2019s individualistic bent, both in epistemology and social\nlife, was in stark contrast to the logical positivist vision of\nknowledge and society, particularly the strand of positivism driven by\nOtto Neurath (1882\u20131945). The latter\u2019s aversion to the\nprivate compelled him to express even first-hand observation reports\nas third-person happenings in space and time, of the following type:\n\u201cOtto\u2019s protocol at 3:17 o\u2019clock: [Otto\u2019s\nspeech-thinking at 3:16 o\u2019clock was: (at 3:15 o\u2019clock\nthere was a table in the room perceived by Otto)].\u201d (Neurath\n1932\u201333 [1983, p. 93]). Bridgman was unyielding in his\nopposition to Neurath\u2019s type of objectification of personal\nexperience. To him, operations provided the best possible refuge from\nthe ocean of uncertainty always threatening to engulf science, and the\nrelative certainty was only possible if he was learning from his own\noperations, not from second-hand reports from some other person. In\nthis regard Bridgman was closer to the strand of logical positivism\nrepresented by Moritz Schlick (1882\u20131936), who insisted on\nmaintaining the notion of direct experience as the final arbiter of\nknowledge. Schlick (1930 [1979]) admitted that experience was fleeting\nand only provided momentary points of verification rather than any\nlasting \u201cfoundation\u201d one could build knowledge on.\nBridgman\u2019s operations had more promise in this regard, as the\noperations were meant to be repeatable so the descriptions of\noperations and their results would be lasting. However, that was not\nto be such a straightforward matter, as we will see in Section\n3.4.\n\nAs Holton (1995a; 2005) reports from his first-hand observations, the\nprivacy of operations (and the consequent privacy of science) was not\nan idle philosophical doctrine for Bridgman. In the lab he carried out\nas much of the work as possible with his own hands, using few\nassistants and crafting most of his instruments himself. Holton\n(1995a, 222\u2013223) quotes the following report as typical of the\nway Bridgman worked: \u201cIt is easy, if all precautions are\nobserved, to drill a hole \u2026 17 inches long, in from 7 to 8\nhours\u201d\u2014that is, a hole as narrow as the lead in a pencil,\nin a block of very hard steel. In academic life Bridgman (1955, 44)\nopenly lamented the \u201cintellectual fashion \u2026 of\nemphasizing that all our activities are fundamentally social in\nnature\u201d. As for his social and political writings, they were\noften agonizing attempts to clarify, for himself, the place of the\n\u201cintelligent individual\u201d in society. He was unabashedly\nelitist, both on behalf of the gifted individual and of scientists as\na group, and argued that giving appropriate special treatment to\nscientists would in the end benefit society (that is, all the\nindividuals in society). Maila Walter observes (1990, 192\u2013193):\n\u201cWithin the community of scientists and scientific philosophers,\nBridgman had become the lone spokesman for a radical existential\nsubjectivism\u201d, more akin to Rheinhold Niebuhr\u2019s\nexistentialist theology than to any commonly recognized philosophy of\nscience. Bridgman\u2019s uncompromising individualism continued right\nto the end, with a self-administered euthanasia in the late stage of a\npainful terminal illness (see Holton 1995a, 226\u2013227).\n3. Current relevance of operationalism\n\nIs operationalism only a historical curiosity? In this final section,\nI would like to give a synoptic view of the relevance of\noperationalism to some issues that are current in philosophy of\nscience.\n3.1 Operations as units of analysis of scientific practice\n\nAs already noted, Bridgman\u2019s ideas first gained recognition in\nthe midst of the logical-positivist preoccupation with language and\nmeaning; therefore, operationalism was taken primarily as a doctrine\nabout meaning and, as such, shown to be inadequate. In that context,\nit was reasonable for most philosophers to abandon it. Bridgman made\nvarious attempts to get beyond the popular caricature of\noperationalism adopted by advocates and critics alike. These attempts\nnever received sufficient attention, but they offer some valuable\nlessons and show many productive directions in which his views can be\ninterpreted and extended.\n\nIt is useful to continue listening to his retrospective given in the\n1953 AAAS conference, quoted earlier. Bridgman tells us that what he\nadvocated was merely:\n\nan attitude or point of view generated by continued practice of\noperational analysis. So far as any dogma is involved here at all, it\nis merely the conviction that it is better, because it takes us\nfurther, to analyze into doings or happenings rather than into objects\nor entities. (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 76)\n\n\nAlready in his paper on \u201cOperational Analysis\u201d Bridgman\n(1938, 115\u2013116) had stated that in the attempt to understand how\nscience works, \u201cthe subject matter \u2026 is activity of one\nsort or another\u201d. He equated \u201cactivity\u201d and\n\u201coperations\u201d, the term \u201coperation\u201d only\naccentuating the directedness of the activity in question. In his last\ngeneral philosophical treatise, The Way Things Are, Bridgman\ncame back to this theme and stated that an operational analysis was\nonly \u201ca particular case of an analysis in terms of\nactivities\u2014doings or happenings\u201d, instead of analysis\n\u201cin terms of objects or static abstractions\u201d, or \u201cin\nterms of things or static elements\u201d (1959a, 3; also 1959b,\n522).\n\nIf we take our inspiration from this later Bridgman, we can take him\nas a guide for a new practice-oriented philosophy of science. We can\nput aside his reductive doctrine of meaning, his puritanical search\nfor certainty, and his ambivalent privileging of instrumental\noperations over other types of operations. What Bridgman started up\nbut never quite accomplished in a systematic and complete way was a\nphilosophical analysis of science in terms of activities. Operations\nprovide the philosopher (and the historian) of science with a very\nuseful unit of analysis: actions or events, as opposed to objects,\nstatements, beliefs, theories, paradigms, research programs, etc. The\nconcept of operation should provide an effective framework for\nincorporating certain highly valuable insights about the nature of\nscientific practice, including the ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953)\non language-games, Michael Polanyi (1958) on tacit knowledge, Marjorie\nGrene (1974) on the knowing agent, and Ian Hacking (1983) on direct\ninterventions in experimental investigations.\n\nIn order to develop Bridgman\u2019s operational analysis into a\nfull-fledged philosophy of scientific practice, there are some aspects\nof his thought that we need to develop and articulate further. First\nof all, as noted in Section 2.3 above, we need a clearer and more\ndetailed taxonomy of operations, without trying to say which types are\nbetter or worse at the outset. From this point of view it should not\nbe regarded as a problem or an annoyance that there are different\ntypes of operations. The categories offered by Bridgman are much too\nbroad, so we need to identify and describe specific and concrete\noperations, and also distinguish simple and elementary ones from more\ncomplex ones. For example, the operation of length measurement with a\nmeter-stick would be analyzable into the instrumental operations of\nalignment and concatenation, the perceptual operation of judging\nspatial coincidence, and the mental operation of counting. The\noperation of hypothesis-testing (in the \u201creceived view\u201d)\nwould be analyzable into the simpler operations of deductive\nprediction, experimental observation, and the comparison between\ndeduced and observed outcomes. In the understanding of these\noperations we would need a detailed account of the scientist as the\nagent who performs the operations; here we return to Bridgman\u2019s\npreoccupation with the free individual, but also in essential social\ninteraction with other individuals. A full understanding of operations\nwould require an understanding of the agent\u2019s purposes (partly\nbased on the fundamental aims of science), assumptions (including\nmetaphysical principles essential for the particular type of activity\nin question), and skills and capabilities (including the tacit\ndimension). If we can achieve such a thick description of the\noperations that constitute scientific practice, we would be able to\nmake good on Bridgman\u2019s promise that \u201cit is better,\nbecause it takes us further, to analyze into doings or happenings\nrather than into objects or entities.\u201d\n3.2 Operationalism as a philosophy of extension\n\nAbove I presented a new operationalism as a promising framework for\nthe analysis of scientific practice. Do Bridgman\u2019s ideas and\nattitudes also hold any current relevance for practicing \n scientists?[5]\nIt should have been clear from the discussion in Section 1 above that\nBridgman intended to reform scientific practice itself, not just its\nsecond-order analysis, so we must ask whether his reformist agenda has\nanything left in it for current science. To the casual reader, much of\nBridgman\u2019s writing will seem like a series of radical complaints\nabout the meaninglessness of various concepts and statements. But he\nwas not interested in skeptical critique as an idle and indiscriminate\nphilosophical exercise. He got most worried when a concept was being\nextended to new situations where the familiar operations defining the\nconcept ceased to be applicable. His arguments often had an\niconoclastic flavor because he was exceptionally good at recognizing\nwhere a concept had been extended to new domains unthinkingly and most\npeople were not even aware that the extension had been made. From the\nmethodological lesson he took from Einstein to the insights gained in\nhis own high-pressure physics, an important focus of Bridgman\u2019s\noperationalism was on regulating the extension of concepts to\nuncharted domains.\n\nBridgman reminded us forcefully that measurement operations did not\nhave unlimited domains of application, and that our conceptual\nstructures consequently had \u201cjoints\u201d at which operational\nmeanings changed. But there can be no \u201cjoints\u201d if there is\nno continuous tissue around the disjointed bones. Less metaphorically:\nif we reduce meaning entirely to measurement operations, there are no\npossible grounds for assuming or demanding any continuity of meaning\nwhere there is clear discontinuity in measurement operations. When we\nhave two different operations which give convergent results in the\noverlapping domain, how do we tell whether what we have is an\naccidental convergence of the measured values of two unrelated\nquantities, or a unified concept measured by two different methods?\nSome critics have maintained that only a recourse to theories can give\nus the answer (e.g., Lindsay 1937, 458; Gillies 1972, 23). That does\nnot seem to me always necessary, as theory is not the only source of\nsemantic continuity. There are instrumental operations that are not\nmetrological, and these operations can provide a continuity of meaning\nagainst which metrological validity can be judged (see Section 2.1).\nWe can take operationalism as a useful and practicable caution not to\nmake conceptual extensions without operational grounds.\n\nA homespun example from the 18th century illustrates this point\nnicely: the efforts of the English potter Josiah Wedgwood\n(1730\u20131795) to extend the temperature scale to cover the very\nhigh temperatures in his kilns, at which mercury vaporized and glass\nmelted. All previously known thermometers failed in that pyrometric\nrange, so Wedgwood felt obliged to invent a whole new measurement\nstandard (reminiscent of Bridgman in his high-pressure laboratory).\nWedgwood noticed that very high temperatures made pieces of clay\nshrink, and created a temperature scale by assuming that the amount of\ncontraction was proportional to temperature beyond \u201cred\nheat\u201d. As the start of his scale (red heat, defined as 0) was\nalready beyond the boiling point of mercury, Wedgwood\u2019s scale\nwas wholly disconnected from the temperature scale defined by mercury\nthermometers. Later, in response to widespread demand to clarify the\nmeaning of his scale in more usual terms, Wedgwood made a translation\nof his scale into Fahrenheit degrees, by means of an intermediate\nstandard (thermal expansion of silver) which overlapped with the high\nend of the mercury scale and the low end of the clay scale. (This\nprocedure produced some unlikely numbers, for example 21,877\u00b0F for\nthe temperature of his air-furnace.) It seems that Wedgwood initially\ndid exactly what operationalist conscience would dictate: as the new\ninstrument did not operate at all in the range of any trustworthy\nprevious thermometers, he made a fresh scale. Why was that not the\nhonest thing to do, and quite sufficient, too? Why did everyone,\nincluding Wedgwood himself, feel compelled to interpret the Wedgwood\nclay scale in terms of the Fahrenheit mercury scale? Why was a\ncontinuous extension desired so strongly, when a disjointed set of\noperations seemed to serve all necessary practical purposes?\n\nThe urge for conceptual extension, in the Wedgwood case, was rooted in\na widespread feeling that there was a property in the\npyrometric range that was continuous in its meaning with temperature\nin the everyday range. Where did that feeling come from, long before\nthere was any well-defined and agreed-upon theoretical concept of\ntemperature? If we look closely at the situation, numerous subtle and\noften-unspoken connections do emerge between pyrometric temperature\nand everyday temperature. In the first place, we do bring objects to\npyrometric domains by prolonged heating\u2014that is to say, by a\nprolonged application of ordinary processes that cause the rise of\ntemperature within the everyday domain. Likewise, the same causes of\ncooling that operate in the everyday domain will bring objects from\npyrometric temperatures down to everyday temperatures; that is\nprecisely what happens in calorimetric pyrometry (or, when we simply\nleave very hot things out in cold air for a while). These concrete\nphysical operations provide a continuity of operational meaning\nbetween two domains that are not connected by a common measurement\nstandard. Here again we need to articulate something that Bridgman\nalready did imply: not all instrumental operations are measurement\noperations (for instance, we may know how to make iron melt without\nthereby obtaining any precise idea of the temperature at which that\nhappens). Operational meaning even in the narrow, instrumental sense\nis broader than meaning specified by methods of measurement.\n\nThe connections listed above rest on very basic qualitative causal\nassumptions about temperature: fire raises the temperature of any\nordinary objects on which it acts directly; if two objects at\ndifferent temperatures are put in contact with each other, their\ntemperatures tend to approach each other. There are semi-quantitative\nlinks as well. It is taken for granted that the consumption of more\nfuel should result in the generation of more heat, and that is partly\nbased on a primitive notion of energy conservation. It is assumed that\nthe amount of heat communicated to an object is roughly proportional\nto the amount of change in its temperature (barring changes of state\nand interfering influences), and that assumption is based on the rough\nbut robust understanding of temperature as the \u201cdegree of\nheat.\u201d So, for example, when a crucible is put on a steady fire,\none assumes that the temperature of its contents will rise steadily,\nup to a certain maximum. That is exactly the kind of reasoning used by\nthe chemist John Frederic Daniell (1790\u20131845) to criticize some\nof Wedgwood\u2019s results:\n\nNow, any body almost knows, how very soon silver melts after it has\nattained a bright red heat, and every practical chemist has observed\nit to his cost, when working with silver crucibles. Neither the\nconsumption of fuel, nor the increase of the air-draught, necessary to\nproduce this effect, can warrant us in supposing that the fusing point\nof silver is 4 1/2 times higher than a red heat, fully visible in\nday-light. Neither on the same grounds, is it possible to admit that a\nfull red-heat being 1077\u00b0[F], and the welding heat of iron\n12,777\u00b0[F], that the fusing point of cast iron can be more than\n5000\u00b0 higher. The welding of iron must surely be considered as\nincipient fusion. (quoted in Chang 2004, 149)\n\n\nSimilar types of rough assumptions were also used in the extension of\ntemperature to very low temperatures (beyond the freezing point of\nmercury and alcohol).\n\nThese cases illustrate that concepts can and do get extended to fresh\nnew domains in which theories are uncertain and experience scant, even\nif no definite measurement operations have been worked out. We start\nwith a concept with a secure net of uses giving it stable meaning in a\nrestricted domain of circumstances. The extension of such a concept\nconsists in giving it a secure net of uses, also credibly linked to\nthe earlier net, in an adjacent domain. Such extension can happen in\nall kinds of ways, including theoretical fiat and metaphysical\npresumption, but the operational method is the most assured one.\nSpecific, well-defined operations, whether they be instrumental,\nmental or paper-and-pencil type, can start a secure skeleton of\nmeaning in the new domain. With all the elements of new meaning\noperationally well-defined, it also becomes possible to attempt\nlinking them up with each other at each step along the way and check\nthe whole meaning for coherence. (Compare such a deliberate process\nwith the vague presumption that terms in a theoretical equation must\nhave the same meaning in the entire mathematical range given to the\nvariables.) Operationalism in this guise can be used as a secure\nmethod of conceptual extension, quite the opposite of the kind of\nfragmentation that Hempel feared. Such operationalism would not\ndestroy systematic unity; on the contrary, it is an optimal strategy\nfor achieving as much systematic unity as nature would allow, in a\nstrongly empiricist system of knowledge.\n3.3 Operationalism as a strategy for increasing empirical content\n\nConceptual extension is important, especially since it served as one\nof the key initial motivations of Bridgman\u2019s thought, but it is\nonly part of the operationalist story. In more general terms,\noperationalism can be seen as a strategy for increasing the empirical\ncontent of scientific theories. What is empirical content? Karl Popper\nsaw the amount of the empirical content of a theory as the number of\nstates of the world that are forbidden by it. Regarding laws of nature\nhe said: \u201cthe more they prohibit they more they say\u201d\n(Popper 1972, 41). Or, somewhat more formally: \u201cI define the\nempirical content of a statement p as the class of\nits potential falsifiers\u201d (120). Similarly but staying away from\nthe strict falsificationist idiom, Imre Lakatos understood empirical\ncontent as the number of empirically testable predictions. Empirical\ncontent is not something we hear about very much these days in\nphilosophy of science after the receding of Popperian and Lakatosian\ndoctrines, but for Bridgman and many other operationalists it was one\nof the key issues.\n\nIf we take operationalism as a commitment to increase empirical\ncontent, Bridgman was not so much a high-handed judge who pronounced\nupon the meaningfulness of concepts in a black-and-white manner.\nRather, he offered operational analysis as a tool of self-diagnosis\nand self-improvement. He was interested in advancing science, not in\ncarping against it; like Descartes, he used skepticism as a means of\nachieving a more positive end. In this connection there is a point to\nBunge\u2019s (1988, 341) contention that \u201coperational\ndefinition\u201d is a misnomer and we should instead speak of\n\u201cindicator hypotheses\u201d that offer links between\nunobservable properties and observable ones. In my view,\nBridgman\u2019s enterprise can be understood quite well as an\ninstance of what goes by the name of \u201cconceptual\nengineering\u201d these days (see Cappelen 2018, and Brun 2016 for\nconnections with Carnapian explication). Concepts can be engineered to\nvarious ends, and in the case of operationalism the overriding concern\nis to make them as empirically meaningful as the circumstances\npermit.\n\nThe operationalist dictum could be phrased as follows: maintain and\nincrease the empirical content of theories by the use of operationally\nwell-defined concepts. It is difficult to craft an exact quantitative\nmeasure of empirical content, but we can at least say that the amount\nof empirical content depends on the number of empirically testable\nrelations that a theory specifies. That, in turn, depends on the\nnumber of independently measurable parameters. Increasing the number\nof independent parameters, or at least maintaining it, was something\nthat Bridgman sought to achieve with his operationalism. This, I\nsubmit, was one of the key reasons why he did not like conceptual\nextensions that were not backed up by measurement operations in the\nnew domain. And it seems to me that this lesson was taken to heart by\nthe operationist psychologists much more than the physicists, as Feest\n(2010; 2012) explains in her discussion of how operational definitions\nshould be understood as tools of experimental investigation.\n\nTo follow Bridgman\u2019s thinking along these lines, consider this\nintriguing passage, which at first glance looks like another complaint\nabout meaninglessness. But towards the end the main point emerges as a\nworry about diminishing empirical content:\n\nWhat is the possible meaning of the statement that the diameter of an\nelectron is 10-13 cm? Again the only answer is found by\nexamining the operations by which the number 10-13 was\nobtained. This number came by solving certain equations derived from\nthe field equations of electrodynamics, into which certain numerical\ndata obtained by experiment had been substituted. The concept of\nlength has therefore now been so modified as to include that theory of\nelectricity embodied in the field equations, and, most important,\nassumes the correctness of extending these equations from the\ndimensions in which they may be verified experimentally into a region\nin which their correctness is one of the most important and\nproblematical of present-day questions in physics. To find whether the\nfield equations are correct on a small scale, we must verify the\nrelations demanded by the equations between the electric and magnetic\nforces and the space co\u00f6rdinates, to determine which involves\nmeasurement of lengths. But if these space co\u00f6rdinates cannot be\ngiven an independent meaning apart from the equations, not only is the\nattempted verification of the equations impossible, but the question\nitself is meaningless. If we stick to the concept of length by itself,\nwe are landed in a vicious circle. As a matter of fact, the concept of\nlength disappears as an independent thing, and fuses in a complicated\nway with other concepts, all of which are themselves altered thereby,\nwith the result that the total number of concepts used in describing\nnature at this level is reduced in\n number.[6]\n (Bridgman 1927, 21\u201322)\n\n\nSuch a reduction in the number of operationally meaningful concepts\nwill almost inevitably result in a corresponding reduction in the\nnumber of relations that can be tested empirically. A good scientist\nwould fight against such a prospect of diminished empirical\ncontent.\n\nThis concern with empirical content also explains why Bridgman was not\ncontent with the mainstream post-positivist philosophical discourse on\nconcept-formation and empirical significance, exemplified by the works\nof Carl Hempel and Willard Van Orman Quine. As noted in Section 2.2,\nBridgman did not object to theoretical science creating a system of\nconcepts and laws that made contact with observations only at some\npoints. However, Quinean holism, in which the unit of empirical\nsignificance was the entire system of knowledge, had no particular\nconcern about increasing the number of those points-of-contact with\nexperience. Bridgman\u2019s ideal was to operationalize each and\nevery concept if possible, and each case of de-operationalization rang\nalarm bells in his head.\n\nRecognizing the importance of empirical content helps us make sense of\nBridgman\u2019s complex attitude toward theoretical concepts. In a\nlittle-known section of The Logic of Modern Physics, he\ndiscussed what he called \u201cmental constructs\u201d in science,\nparticularly those created in order to \u201cenable us to deal with\nphysical situations which we cannot directly experience through our\nsenses, but with which we have contact indirectly and by\ninference\u201d (1927, 53\u201360). Not all constructs are the\nsame:\n\nThe essential point is that our constructs fall into two classes:\nthose to which no physical operations correspond other than those\nwhich enter the definition of the construct, and those which admit of\nother operations, or which could be defined in several alternative\nways in terms of physically distinct operations. This difference in\nthe character of constructs may be expected to correspond to essential\nphysical differences, and these physical differences are much too\nlikely to be overlooked in the thinking of physicists. (Bridgman 1927,\n59\u201360)\n\n\nThey were also very easily overlooked in the thinking of\nphilosophers who debated his ideas. What Bridgman says here\nis entirely contrary to the common image of his doctrines. When it\ncame to constructs, \u201cof which physics is full,\u201d Bridgman\nnot only admitted that one concept could correspond to many different\noperations, but even suggested that such multiplicity of operational\nmeaning was \u201cwhat we mean by the reality of things not given\ndirectly by experience.\u201d In an illustration of these ideas,\nBridgman argued that the concept of stress within a solid body had\nphysical reality, but the concept of electric field did not, since the\nlatter only ever manifested itself through force and electric charge,\nby which it was defined (Bridgman 1927, 57). This comes down to the\nstance that a theoretical concept without direct operational meaning\nis worthwhile only if it serves as a mediator connecting two or more\noperationally meaningful concepts, creating an empirically testable\nrelation. This is in fact not so different from Hempel\u2019s view\nquoted in Section 2.2, albeit with a different emphasis.\n3.4 Operational analysis as the revealer of complexity\n\nIn closing, I would like to pull out an insight from Bridgman that is\nusually not recognized in discussions of operationalism, but actually\nhas emerged as a significant point of contention in more recent\nphilosophy of science. This is the issue of complexity. In\nSection 1.1 I have already quoted Bridgman\u2019s puzzling statement\nthat nature is ultimately \u201cneither understandable nor subject to\nlaw.\u201d As it turns out, that was not an isolated off-hand remark.\nAn important aspect of Bridgman\u2019s operationalism was a search\nfor certainty, and it was a search made all the more desperate by a\ndeep-rooted pessimism about the possibility of attaining any certainty\nin science, at least if scientists were to seek a simple and unified\nsystem of knowledge. Bridgman professed his belief that \u201cthe\nexternal world of objects and happenings is \u2026 so complex that\nall aspects of it can never be reproduced by any verbal\nstructure.\u201d He lamented: \u201cEven in physics this is not\nsufficiently appreciated, as is shown, for example, by the reification\nof energy. The totality of situations covered by various aspects of\nthe energy concept is too complex to be reproduced by any simple\nverbal device.\u201d (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 78)\n\nBridgman\u2019s view on the complexity of nature also had a direct\nimplication for the limits of operational analysis itself in providing\nclarity and precision. Right from The Logic of Modern\nPhysics, Bridgman stressed that \u201call results of measurement\nare only approximate\u201d; this obvious fact, he said,\n\u201ctacitly underlies all our discussion\u201d. This he attributed\nultimately to something fundamental about the nature of human\nexperience: \u201call experience seems to be of this character; we\nnever have perfectly clean-cut knowledge of anything, but all our\nexperience is surrounded by a twilight zone, a penumbra of\nuncertainty, into which we have not yet penetrated. This penumbra is\nas truly an unexplored region as any other region beyond\nexperiment\u201d (1927, 33). This indicated a fundamental limitation\nto the certainty of operations: \u201cOperations themselves are, of\ncourse, derived from experience, and would be expected also to have a\nnebulous edge of uncertainty\u201d (1927, 36). Bridgman remained\nclearly aware of the complexities revealed by operational analysis,\nstating late in his life that \u201coperational analysis can always\nbe pushed to the point where sharpness disappears\u201d (Bridgman in\nFrank 1956, 78), and that \u201cthere is nothing absolute or final\nabout an operational analysis\u201d (Bridgman 1959b, 522). Still, he\nwould not give up on the pushing, which was necessary to reach as much\nclarity as possible.\n\nBridgman\u2019s battle against his own skeptical and pessimistic\nconscience was a heroic one. After decades of operationalist thinking\nhe arrived at \u201ca picture of man isolated \u2026 in an oasis of\nphenomena which he will never be able to transcend because beyond its\nbounds the operations are impossible which are necessary to give\nmeaning to his thought\u201d (Bridgman 1955, 540). What this picture\nforced on him was a deep sense of humility, as expressed in his\nmemorable statement on the scientific method: \u201cThe scientific\nmethod, as far as it is a method, is nothing more than doing\none\u2019s damnedest with one\u2019s mind, no holds barred\u201d\n(1955, 535). Retaining that sense of humility will help us in\ndeveloping Bridgman\u2019s unfinished thoughts to create a new\noperationalism that does full justice to the complexity and richness\nof both nature and human scientific practice.\n",
