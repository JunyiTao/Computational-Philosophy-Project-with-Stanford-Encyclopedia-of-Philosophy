The Shifting Status of Multiple Realizability Early in the New Millennium\n\nOver the first decade of the twenty-first century, nonreductive\nphysicalism retained its status as the most popular position in\nAnglo-American philosophy of mind. Its proponents continued to appeal\nto the standard multiple realizability arguments (see\n \u00a71\n above) to challenge all versions of psychophysical reductionism and\nidentity theory. However, the challenges to multiple realizability and\nthe arguments using it, scouted in\n section 2\n above, began to attract wider notice. New versions of type-identity\ntheory and reductive physicalism began to be formulated more widely\n(Gozzano and Hill, 2012). The nonidentity of mental content properties\nwith any physical properties no longer seemed to be the\n\u201cpractically received wisdom\u201d, as Ernest LePore and Barry\nLoewer (1989) called it thirty years ago, although it has clearly\nremained an entrenched view.\n\nSome of these arguments continued lines introduced in\n section 2\n above. But they warrant separate treatment, not just to keep my\npresentation historically accurate, but also because more general\nconsiderations from the metaphysics of science increasingly came to\nmotivate specifics of the new discussions, although some of these more\ngeneral features had been scouted previously in works focused on\nphilosophy of mind (see especially William Lycan 1987).\n",
