    "main_text": "Correspondence with Ren\u00e9 Descartes || Mind-Body Interaction and the Nature of Mind\n4.2 Mind-Body Interaction and the Nature of Mind\n\nThe correspondence between Elisabeth and Descartes begins with\nElisabeth\u2019s asking probing questions about how Descartes can explain\nthe ability of an immaterial substance to act on a material substance.\nAt issue in this initial query is the kind of causation operating\nbetween mind and body. As Elisabeth frames the issues, existing\naccounts tie causal efficacy to extension, and in this regard it is\nsignificant that she poses her question about the mind\u2019s ability to\nact on the body, and not the body\u2019s ability to affect the mind. To\naccount for the causal efficacy of an immaterial mind, Elisabeth\nsuggests that Descartes can articulate either the account of causation\nproper to mind-body interaction or the substantial nature of the mind\nsuch that existing accounts could explain its actions. Descartes\u2019s\nresponse is not only evasive but opens up further issues, in\nparticular about whether the mind-body union is a third substance,\ninsofar as he appeals to the Scholastic notion of heaviness to address\nElisabeth\u2019s concerns (Garber 1983), and intimates there is a\ncontradiction in thinking of mind and body as both two distinct\nsubstances and as united (Mattern 1978). In addition, in his\nresponses, Descartes jumps between the two separate issues of\nmind-body and body-mind interaction (Rozemond 1999). My concern in\nthis entry is not, however, to articulate the views expressed in\nDescartes\u2019s side of the correspondence.\n\nThis exchange reveals that Elisabeth is committed to a mechanist\naccount of causation\u2014that is, one limited to efficient\ncausation. Elisabeth rejects Descartes\u2019s appeal to the Scholastic\nconception of heaviness as a model through which to explain mind-body\ninteraction, on the grounds that, as Descartes himself previously\nargued, it is unintelligible and inconsistent with a mechanist\nconception of nature. That is, she squarely rejects the formal causal\nexplanatory model underlying the Scholastic notion of a real quality,\ninsofar as she refuses to consider that model appropriate in some\ncontexts. She is nonetheless open-minded about which account of\nefficient causation ought to be adopted. This openness reveals that\nshe is apprised of debates about the nature of causation in the period\n(Gabbey 1990, Clatterbaugh 1999, Nadler 1993). Elisabeth\u2019s investment\nin the new science emerging in the seventeenth century is reflected in\nwhat she writes regarding mathematics and natural philosophy,\ndiscussed briefly in the next subsection.\n\nElisabeth\u2019s remarks to Descartes also suggest that she is willing to\nrevisit Descartes\u2019s substance dualism. She presses Descartes to\nfurther articulate his account of substance, pointing not only to the\nproblem of mind-body interaction, but also to cases where the poor\ncondition of the body\u2014the vapours, for instance\u2014affects\ncapacity for thought. These cases, she intimates, would be more\nstraightforwardly explained by considering the mind to be material and\nextended. The issue of the role of the condition of the body in our\ncapacity for thought also figures in the correspondence of 1645,\nconcerning the regulation of the passions, from both a theoretical and\na personal perspective. Elisabeth maintains that we have autonomy of\nthought\u2014that we have control over what we think and can turn our\nattention from one object to another\u2014 and so that the order of\nthought does not depend on the causal order of material things.\nHowever, at the same time she acknowledges that the capacity for\nthought, and the free will essential to it, is dependent on the\noverall condition of the body. Elisabeth thus rejects an account of\nmind that reduces thinking to bodily states, but at the same time she\ncalls into question the idea that the capacity of thinking exists\nwholly independently of body, that is, that a thinking thing is\nsubstance properly speaking. As Alanen (2021) puts it, what is at\nissue in this exchange is how to understand the agency proper to\nthought. Shapiro (1999 and 2007) suggests that while Elisabeth might\nbe willing to revisit substance dualism, she does not advocate clearly\nfor any alternative. Janssen-Lauret (2018) maintains that in the end\nElisabeth endorses substance dualism and argues that Elisabeth\nsubscribes to a naturalistic dualism, which holds that the soul is\nboth conscious and extended without endorsing materialism.\n\nInterestingly, Elisabeth introduces her own nature as female as one\nbodily \u2018condition\u2019 that can impact reason. While Descartes\nconcedes that a certain threshold of bodily health is necessary for\nthe freedom that characterizes rational thought, he disregards\nElisabeth\u2019s appeal to the \u201cweakness of my sex\u201d (Shapiro\n1999). Pellegrin (2021), in analyzing how the female body figures in\nthe correspondence between Descartes and Elisabeth, argues that the\nvery idea of a weak sex is antithetical to Cartesianism.\n",
