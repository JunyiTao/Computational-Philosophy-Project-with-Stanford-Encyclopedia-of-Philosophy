    "main_text": "What is the Structure of the Real World? || Fundamental Categories\n5.1 Fundamental Categories\n\nAmong fundamental categories, paired categories are the most general\nstructural elements of being. As structural elements they\nhave content, and there are composite relations among them (A23b).\nHartmann organizes the various pairs into two groups of six pairs,\nwithout claiming that the list of paired oppositions is exhaustive.\nThe first group includes principle-concretum,\nstructure-modus, form-matter, inner-outer, determination-dependence,\nquality-quantity; the second group includes unity-manifoldness,\nharmony-conflict, opposition-dimension, discreteness-continuity,\nsubstratum-relation, element-complex. There is no intrinsic order\namong the pairs (A24a). It is apparent that some of these are easier\nto grasp than others. To provide a sample of Hartmann\u2019s\nanalysis, we now briefly describe two of the pairs,\nprinciple-concretum and element-complex (for more details see\nWerkmeister 1990, Poli 2011a, and A sections).\n\nPrinciple-Concretum: Concretum for Hartmann\nis what is determinate, that in which categories are embedded as their\ndeterminations. The concretum is not limited to real\nentities, but includes ideal ones as well. Furthermore, the\nconcretum for Hartmann is not to be understood as limited to\nthe individual instances of a principle because there can be different\nlevels of concreta. For instance, strata categories are\nconcreta with respect to general categories. In this case,\nboth the concretum and its principles are categories. Real\ncategories contain all the universal determinations of their\nconcreta; they contain what is needed for the structure of\nthe concreta. A complete system of categories\u2014not the\nincomplete one we are able to grasp\u2014completely determines its\nconcreta (A4a). As natural laws exist only in the real\nprocesses of nature and are nothing outside of them, so real\ncategories exist only as structural relations within the real world\nand are nothing in themselves (A16c). The principle-concretum\nform of determination is only one among a variety of types of\ndetermination, and in no way is it the most relevant in the real\nworld. In fact, each real level has its own specific types of\ndetermination, such as the specific linear nexus (causal, final, etc.)\nthat unifies the phases of the processes that unfold within and\nbetween concreta. In sum, principles are that through which\nthe concretum is (partially) grasped. They are the\narchai of the concretum, the condition of its\npossibility or that on which the concretum rests. They have\nunconstrained validity for all the concreta that fall within\ntheir range (A27c).\n\nElement-complex: Complexes are relational entities. In\nPhilosophy of Nature, Hartmann explains that he prefers the\nterm \u201ccomplex\u201d (Gef\u00fcge) to the \u201cworn\nout\u201d (verbrauchten) term \u201csystem\u201d (N38c).\nThe elements of a complex are its members, not substrata, and elements\nare determined by the complex of which they are members (A25c).\nComplexes have their own type of determination, and in each case the\ndetermination extends across the complex\u2019s elements and\ntransforms them. A complex of elements is always a complex of\nrelations and determinations. Elements are essentially determined by\nthe positions they occupy within the complex\u2019s total series of\nrelations (A33a). This explains why elements have functions within the\ncomplex. Within a complex, what matters are not the elements, but the\nrelations that they maintain among themselves and with the complex. An\nirregularly shaped stone, a grain of sand, a puddle, a mountain are\nnot independent complexes, but fragments and parts of larger\nformations that come into existence before them and within which they\nexist as subordinate moments (A33c). All natural complexes are\ncomplexes of forces and processes, but physical complexes and\norganisms are different. The inside of the complex of processes that\nconstitutes an organism is the capacity of the complex to maintain its\nworking conditions\u2014what Hartmann calls the self-determination of\nthe organism (A34c), while a physical complex maintains its dynamic\nstability through equilibrium with its exterior.\n\nReaders might have noted that while the principle-concretum pair seems\nto cover some of the terrain of the old distinction between essence\nand existence, it does not entirely coincide with it. Hartmann\nrejected those terms in favor of a more accurate distinction between\nSosein (\u201cbeing-such-and-such-a-way\u201d) and\nDasein as \u201cways of being.\u201d Dasein and\nSosein can be approximately understood as existence and\ndetermination. Both real and ideal entities have both Sosein\nand Dasein. Mathematical entities and values\n\u201cexist\u201d in an atemporal way, for example, and have their\nown determinations. While the general is a dominant category in the\nideal sphere and a subordinate category in the sphere of the real,\nindividuality is a category of the sphere of real being only. In the\nrealm of ideal being there is no individual. Ultimately, what\nrigorously distinguishes the real from the ideal spheres themselves\nare the different \u201cintermodal relations\u201d of necessity,\npossibility, and actuality in each. In Possibility and\nActuality, a book which still awaits close scrutiny by\nresearchers, Hartmann argues for some of his most startling\nclaims.\n\nRejecting the Aristotelian notion of \u201cpartial possibility\u201d\non which most conceptions of possibility are based, Hartmann embraces\na \u201cMegarian\u201d conception of \u201creal possibility.\u201d\nHartmann examines the differences between \u201creal\npossibility\u201d and \u201cessential [or ideal] possibility,\u201d\n\u201creal necessity\u201d and \u201cessential [or ideal]\nnecessity,\u201d among others, and argues that paradoxically the\npossible, the actual, and the necessary coincide in the real world\n(Hartmann 2017 [1937]; PA16b-c). In other words, the real world is\nfully determinate, and whatever is possible is possible within the\nbounds of the actual world. (Peruzzi 2001 considers the relation\nbetween Hartmann\u2019s view of modality and \u201cpossible\nworlds\u201d semantics.)\n\nThe ways of being Sosein and Dasein are also in a\nsense relative, or positional. Hartmann presents their positional\nalternation this way: the Dasein of a tree is the\nSosein of a forest (OLF19a); i.e., without the existing tree\nthe content of the forest would be different. Similarly, the\nDasein of the branch is the Sosein of the tree, the\nDasein of the leaf is the Sosein of the branch, and\nthe Dasein of the vein is the Sosein of the leaf.\nThings can be inverted, too: the Sosein of the leaf is the\nDasein of the vein; the Sosein of the branch is the\nDasein of the leaf, etc. The Dasein-Sosein\nseries has two limits: towards the first, original Dasein and\ntowards the last Sosein, the Sosein of the whole of\nreality. The mainstream interpretation of Dasein and\nSosein, or existence and essence, as entirely\nseparate aspects of being, depends on epistemological acts of\nisolation. Only when aspects are separated do independent substances\nand dependent qualities appear, and it is for this reason that it\nseems that qualities do not have any Dasein and,\ncomplementarily, that their bearers have no Sosein (OLF20c).\nThis is just one of the novel and transformative findings in\nHartmann\u2019s ontological analysis that overcomes difficulties with\nthe traditional contrast between essence and existence.\n",
