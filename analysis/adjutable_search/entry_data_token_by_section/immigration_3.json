    "main_text": "Arguments for Closed Borders || Political Functioning\n1.4 Political Functioning\n\n\nOne of the most sophisticated arguments on behalf of a state\u2019s\nright to close its borders is the liberal nationalist approach, which\nsuggests that liberal welfare states must exclude outsiders in order to\nfunction properly. This account emphasizes that states of this\nkind are able to operate as they do only because their citizens are\nwilling to make the enormous political sacrifices necessary to sustain\na vibrant democracy and equitable welfare state. What is more,\nthese citizens are inclined to freely sacrifice in these ways only\nbecause they identify with one another. Were it not for this\nfellow feeling among compatriots, far fewer would be motivated to\ninvest their personal energy in the democratic process or to give up a\nportion of their wealth in order to assist less fortunate fellow\ncitizens. And finally, this identification among compatriots\ndepends upon the existence of a shared culture (Miller 2014). \n\n\nThis liberal nationalist account invites all the usual\nquestions: Do liberal democracies really depend upon sufficient\ntrust and fellow-feeling among their compatriots, and, if so, is a\ncommon culture genuinely necessary to secure this trust and mutual\nconcern? Just how homogenous must such a culture be?\nLiberal democracies like the United States and Canada seem to operate\njust fine despite a great deal of cultural diversity, for\ninstance. In light of this, why worry that outsiders pose a\nsubstantial threat? Is it plausible to think that immigrants will\nnot assimilate to the requisite degree once they have settled in their\nnew state? And even if this account can in some cases justify\nexcluding culturally distinct foreigners, it would appear to provide no\ngrounds for limiting outsiders who share the requisite cultural\nattributes. Assuming that the answers to these empirical questions\nultimately vindicate the liberal nationalist account, tricky moral\nquestions remain. For instance, do the inhabitants of well-oiled\nliberal democracies have not only an interest, but a moral\nright to the exclusive protection afforded by their enviable\npolitical regimes? Finally, even if each of these questions can\nbe satisfactorily answered, this account applies solely to democratic\nwelfare states, and thus other types of states could not invoke this\nline of reasoning in defense of excluding outsiders.\n",
