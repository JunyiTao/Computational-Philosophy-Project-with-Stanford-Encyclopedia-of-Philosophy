    "main_text": "Interpreting the formalism || The signification of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\)\n4.1 The signification of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\)\n\nFirst, they suggest that the signification of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\),\ngiven a ground model \\(M\\), is the revision rule \\(\\tau_M\\) itself. As\nnoted in the preceding paragraph, we can give a fine-grained analysis\nof sentences\u2019 statuses and interrelations on the basis of\nnotions generated directly and naturally from the revision rule\n\\(\\tau_M\\). Thus, \\(\\tau_M\\) is a good candidate for the signification\nof \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\), since it does seem to be \u201can abstract\nsomething that carries all the information about all [of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\)\u2019s] extensional relations\u201d in \\(M\\).\n(See Gupta and Belnap\u2019s characterization of an\nexpression\u2019s signification, given in Section 2,\nabove.)\n4.2 The \u2018iff\u2019 in the T-biconditionals\n\nGupta and Belnap\u2019s related suggestion concerning the\n\u2018iff\u2019 in the T-biconditionals is that, rather than being\nthe classical biconditional, this \u2018iff\u2019 is the distinctive\nbiconditional used to define a previously undefined concept.\nIn 1993, Gupta and Belnap present the revision theory of truth as a\nspecial case of a revision theory of circularly defined\nconcepts. Suppose that \\(L\\) is a language with a unary predicate\n\\(F\\) and a binary predicate \\(R\\). Consider a new concept expressed\nby a predicate \\(G\\), introduced through a definition like this:\n\n\\[\nGx =_{df} \\forall y(Ryx \\supset Fx) \\vee \\exists y(Ryx \\amp Gx).\n\\]\n\n\nSuppose that we start with a domain of discourse, \\(D\\), and an\ninterpretation of the predicate \\(F\\) and the relation symbol \\(R\\).\nGupta and Belnap\u2019s revision-theoretic treatment of concepts thus\ncircularly introduced allows one to give categorical verdicts, for\ncertain \\(d \\in D\\) about whether or not \\(d\\) satisfies \\(G\\). Other\nobjects will be unstable relative to \\(G\\): we will be able\ncategorically to assert neither that \\(d\\) satisfies \\(G\\) nor that d\ndoes not satisfy \\(G\\). In the case of truth, Gupta and Belnap take\nthe set of T-biconditionals of the form \n\\[\\tag{10}\n\\boldsymbol{T}\\lsquo A\\rsquo =_{df} A\n\\]\n\n\ntogether to give the definition of the concept of truth. It is their\ntreatment of \u2018\\(=_{df}\\)\u2019 (the \u2018iff\u2019 of\ndefinitional concept introduction), together with the T-biconditionals\nof the form (10), that determine the revision rule \\(\\tau_M\\).\n4.3 The paradoxical reasoning\n\nRecall the liar sentence, (1), from the beginning of this article:\n\n(1)\n(1) is not true\n\n\nIn Section 1, we claimed that the RTT is designed to model, rather\nthan block, the kind of paradoxical reasoning regarding (1). But we\nnoted in footnote 2 that the RTT does avoid contradictions in these\nsituations. There are two ways to see this. First, while the RTT does\nendorse the biconditional\n\n(1) is true iff (1) is not true, \n\nthe relevant \u2018iff\u2019 is not the material biconditional, as\nexplained above. Thus, it does not follow that both (1) is true and\n(1) is not true. Second, note that on no hypothesis can we conclude\nthat both (1) is true and (1) is not true. If we keep it firmly in\nmind that revision-theoretical reasoning is hypothetical rather than\ncategorical, then we will not infer any contradictions from the\nexistence of a sentence such as (1), above.\n4.4 The signification thesis\n\nGupta and Belnap\u2019s suggestions, concerning the signification of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) and the interpretation of the \u2018iff\u2019 in\nthe T-biconditionals, dovetail nicely with two closely related\nintuitions articulated in Gupta & Belnap 1993. The first\nintuition, loosely expressed, is \u201cthat the T-biconditionals are\nanalytic and fix the meaning of \u2018true\u2019\u201d (p.\n6). More tightly expressed, it becomes the \u201cSignification\nThesis\u201d (p. 31): \u201cThe T-biconditionals fix the\nsignification of truth in every world [where a world is represented by\na ground\n model].\u201d[7]\n Given the revision-theoretic treatment of the definition\n\u2018iff\u2019, and given a ground model \\(M\\), the\nT-biconditionals (10) do, as noted, fix the suggested signification of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\), i.e., the revision rule \\(\\tau_M\\).\n4.5 The supervenience of semantics\n\nThe second intuition is the supervenience of the signification of\ntruth. This is a descendant of M. Kremer\u2019s 1988 proposed\nsupervenience of semantics. The idea is simple: which\nsentences fall under the concept truth should be fixed by (1)\nthe interpretation of the nonsemantic vocabulary, and (2) the\nempirical facts. In non-circular cases, this intuition is particularly\nstrong: the standard interpretation of \u201csnow\u201d and\n\u201cwhite\u201d and the empirical fact that snow is white, are\nenough to determine that the sentence \u201csnow is white\u201d\nfalls under the concept truth. The supervenience of the\nsignification of truth is the thesis that the signification of truth,\nwhatever it is, is fixed by the ground model \\(M\\). Clearly, the RTT\nsatisfies this principle.\n\nIt is worth seeing how a theory of truth might violate this principle.\nConsider a truth-teller sentence, i.e., the sentence that says of\nitself that it is true:\n\n(11)\n(11) is true\n\n\nAs noted above, Kripke\u2019s three-valued semantics allows three\ntruth values, true \\((\\mathbf{t})\\), false \\((\\mathbf{f})\\), and\nneither \\((\\mathbf{n})\\). Given a ground model \\(M = \\langle\nD,I\\rangle\\) for a truth language \\(L\\), the candidate interpretations\nof \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) are three-valued interpretations, i.e.,\nfunctions \\(h:D \\rightarrow \\{\\mathbf{t}, \\mathbf{f}, \\mathbf{n}\\}\\).\nGiven a three-valued interpretation of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\), and a\nscheme for evaluating the truth value of composite sentences in terms\nof their parts, we can specify a truth value \\(\\textit{Val}_{M+h}(A) =\n\\mathbf{t}, \\mathbf{f}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{n}\\), for every sentence \\(A\\)\nof \\(L\\). The central theorem of the three-valued semantics is that,\ngiven any ground model \\(M\\), there is a three-valued interpretation h\nof \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) so that, for every sentence \\(A\\), we have\n\\(\\textit{Val}_{M+h}(\\boldsymbol{T}\\lsquo A\\rsquo) =\n \\textit{Val}_{M+h}(A)\\).[8]\n We will call such an interpretation of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) an\nacceptable interpretation. Our point here is this: if\nthere\u2019s a truth-teller, as in (11), then there is not only one\nacceptable interpretation of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\); there are three: one\naccording to which (11) is true, one according to which (11) is false,\nand one according to which (11) is neither. Thus, there is no single\n\u201ccorrect\u201d interpretation of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) given a\nground model M. Thus the three-valued semantics seems to violate the\nsupervenience of\n semantics.[9]\n\nThe RTT does not assign a truth value to the truth-teller, (11).\nRather, it gives an analysis of the kind of reasoning that one might\nengage in with respect to the truth-teller: If we start with a\nhypothesis \\(h\\) according to which (11) is true, then upon revision\n(11) remains true. And if we start with a hypothesis \\(h\\) according\nto which (11) is not true, then upon revision (11) remains not true.\nAnd that is all that the concept of truth leaves us with. Given this\nbehaviour of (11), the RTT tells us that (11) is neither categorically\ntrue nor categorically false, but this is quite different from a\nverdict that (11) is neither true nor false.\n4.6 A nonsupervenient interpretation of the formalism\n\nWe note an alternative interpretation of the revision-theoretic\nformalism. Yaq\u016bb 1993 agrees with Gupta and Belnap that the\nT-biconditionals are definitional rather than material biconditionals,\nand that the concept of truth is therefore circular. But Yaq\u016bb\ninterprets this circularity in a distinctive way. He argues that,\n\nsince the truth conditions of some sentences involve reference to\ntruth in an essential, irreducible manner, these conditions can only\nobtain or fail in a world that already includes an extension of the\ntruth predicate. Hence, in order for the revision process to determine\nan extension of the truth predicate, an initial extension of\nthe predicate must be posited. This much follows from circularity and\nbivalence. (1993, 40)\n\n\nLike Gupta and Belnap, Yaq\u016bb posits no privileged extension for\n\\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\). And like Gupta and Belnap, he sees the revision\nsequences of extensions of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\), each sequence generated\nby an initial hypothesized extension, as \u201ccapable of\naccommodating (and diagnosing) the various kinds of problematic and\nunproblematic sentences of the languages under consideration\u201d\n(1993, 41). But, unlike Gupta and Belnap, he concludes from these\nconsiderations that \u201ctruth in a bivalent language is not\nsupervenient\u201d (1993, 39). He explains in a footnote: for\ntruth to be supervenient, the truth status of each sentence must be\n\u201cfully determined by nonsemantical facts\u201d. Yaq\u016bb does\nnot explicitly use the notion of a concept\u2019s\nsignification. But Yaq\u016bb seems committed to the claim\nthat the signification of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) \u2014 i.e., that which\ndetermines the truth status of each sentence \u2014 is given by a\nparticular revision sequence itself. And no revision sequence is\ndetermined by the nonsemantical facts, i.e., by the ground model,\nalone: a revision sequence is determined, at best, by a ground model\nand an initial\n hypothesis.[10]\n4.7 Classifying sentences\n\nTo obtain a signification of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) and a notion of\nvalidity based on the concept of stability (or near stability) is by\nno means the only use we can make of revision sequences. For one\nthing, we could use revision-theoretic notions to make rather\nfine-grained distinctions among sentences: Some sentences are unstable\nin every revision sequence; others are stable in every revision\nsequence, though stably true in some and stably false in others; and\nso on. Thus, we can use revision-theoretic ideas to give a\nfine-grained analysis of the status of various sentences, and of the\nrelationships of various sentences to one another. Hsiung (2017)\nexplores further this possibility by generalizing the notion of a\nrevision sequence to a revision mapping on a digraph, in\norder to extend this analysis to sets of sentences of a\ncertain kind, called Boolean paradoxes. As shown in Hsiung\n2022 this procedure can also be reversed, at least to some extent: Not\nonly we can use revision sequences (or mappings) to classify\nparadoxical sentences by means of their revision-theoretic patterns,\nbut we can also construct \u201cnew\u201d paradoxes from given\nrevision-theoretic patterns. Rossi (2019) combines the\nrevision-theoretic technique with graph-theoretic tools and\nfixed-point constructions in order to represent a threefold\nclassification of paradoxical sentences (liar-like, truth-teller-like,\nand revenge sentences) within a single model.\n5. Further issues\n5.1 Three-valued semantics\n\nWe have given only the barest exposition of the three-valued\nsemantics, in our discussion of the supervenience of the signification\nof truth, above. Given a truth language \\(L\\) and a ground model\n\\(M\\), we defined an acceptable three-valued interpretation\nof \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) as an interpretation \\(h:D \\rightarrow\n\\{\\mathbf{t}, \\mathbf{f}, \\mathbf{n}\\}\\) such that\n\\(\\textit{Val}_{M+h}(\\boldsymbol{T}\\lsquo A\\rsquo) =\n\\textit{Val}_{M+h}(A)\\) for each sentence \\(A\\) of \\(L\\). In general,\ngiven a ground model \\(M\\), there are many acceptable interpretations\nof \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\). Suppose that each of these is indeed a truly\nacceptable interpretation. Then the three-valued semantics violates\nthe supervenience of the signification of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\).\n\nSuppose, on the other hand, that, for each ground model \\(M\\), we can\nisolate a privileged acceptable interpretation as the correct\ninterpretation of \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\). Gupta and Belnap present a\nnumber of considerations against the three-valued semantics, so\nconceived. (See Gupta & Belnap 1993, Chapter 3.) One principal\nargument is that the central theorem, i.e., that for each ground model\nthere is an acceptable interpretation, only holds when the underlying\nlanguage is expressively impoverished in certain ways: for example,\nthe three-valued approach fails if the language has a connective\n\\({\\sim}\\) with the following truth table:\n\n\n\n\\(A\\)\n\\({\\sim}A\\) \n\n\\(\\mathbf{t}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{f}\\) \n\n\\(\\mathbf{f}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{t}\\) \n\n\\(\\mathbf{n}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{t}\\)  \n\n\nThe only negation operator that the three-valued approach can handle\nhas the following truth table:\n\n\n\n\\(A\\)\n\\(\\neg A\\) \n\n\\(\\mathbf{t}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{f}\\) \n\n\\(\\mathbf{f}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{t}\\) \n\n\\(\\mathbf{n}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{n}\\)  \n\n\nBut consider the liar that says of itself that it is \u2018not\u2019\ntrue, in this latter sense of \u2018not\u2019. Gupta and Belnap urge\nthe claim that this sentence \u201cceases to be intuitively\nparadoxical\u201d (1993, 100). The claimed advantage of the RTT is\nits ability to describe the behaviour of genuinely paradoxical\nsentences: the genuine liar is unstable under semantic evaluation:\n\u201cNo matter what we hypothesize its value to be, semantic\nevaluation refutes our hypothesis.\u201d The three-valued semantics\ncan only handle the \u201cweak liar\u201d, i.e., a sentence that\nonly weakly negates itself, but that is not guaranteed to be\nparadoxical: \u201cThere are appearances of the liar here, but they\ndeceive.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve thus far reviewed two of Gupta and Belnap\u2019s\ncomplaints against three-valued approaches, and now we raise a third:\nin the three-valued theories, truth typically behaves like a\nnonclassical concept even when there\u2019s no vicious reference in\nthe language. Without defining terms here, we note that one popular\nprecisification of the three-valued approach, is to take the correct\ninterpretation of T to be that given by the \u2018least fixed\npoint\u2019 of the \u2018strong Kleene scheme\u2019: putting aside\ndetails, this interpretation always assigns the truth value\n\\(\\mathbf{n}\\) to the sentence \\(\\forall\\)x\\((\\boldsymbol{T}\\)x \\(\\vee\n\\neg \\boldsymbol{T}\\)x), even when the ground model allows no\ncircular, let alone vicious, reference. Gupta and Belnap claim an\nadvantage for the RTT: according to revision-theoretic approach, they\nclaim, truth always behaves like a classical concept when there is no\nvicious reference.\n\nKremer 2010 challenges this claim by precisifying it as a formal claim\nagainst which particular revision theories (e.g. \\(\\boldsymbol{T}^*\\)\nor \\(\\boldsymbol{T}^{\\#}\\), see Definition 3.11, above) and particular\nthree-valued theories can be tested. As it turns out, on many\nthree-valued theories, truth does in fact behave like a classical\nconcept when there\u2019s no vicious reference: for example, the\nleast fixed point of a natural variant of the supervaluation scheme\nalways assigns \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) a classical interpretation in the\nabsence of vicious reference. When there\u2019s no vicious reference,\nit is granted that truth behaves like a classical concept if we adopt\nGupta and Belnap\u2019s theory \\(\\boldsymbol{T}^*\\), however, so\nKremer argues, this is not the case if we instead adopt Gupta and\nBelnap\u2019s theory \\(\\boldsymbol{T}^{\\#}\\). This discussion is\nfurther taken up by Wintein 2014. A general assessment of the relative\nmerits of the three-valued approaches and the revision-theoretic\napproaches, from a metasemantic point of view, is at the core of\nPinder 2018.\n5.2 Two values?\n\nA contrast presupposed by this entry is between allegedly two-valued\ntheories, like the RTT, and allegedly three-valued or other\nmany-valued rivals. One might think of the RTT itself as providing\ninfinitely many semantic values, for example one value for every\npossible revision sequence. Or one could extract three semantic values\nfor sentences: categorical truth, categorical falsehood, and\nuncategoricalness.\n\nIn reply, it must be granted that the RTT generates many\nstatuses available to sentences. Similarly, three-valued\napproaches also typically generate many statuses available to\nsentences. The claim of two-valuedness is not a claim about statuses\navailable to sentences, but rather a claim about the truth\nvalues presupposed in the whole enterprise.\n5.3 Amendments to the RTT\n\nWe note three ways to amend the RTT. First, we might put constraints\non which hypotheses are acceptable. For example, Gupta and Belnap 1993\nintroduce a theory, \\(\\mathbf{T}^c\\), of truth based on\nconsistent hypotheses: an hypothesis \\(h\\) is\nconsistent iff the set \\(\\{A:h(A) = \\mathbf{t}\\}\\) is a\ncomplete consistent set of sentences. The relative merits of\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^*, \\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{T}^c\\) are discussed\nin Gupta & Belnap 1993, Chapter 6.\n\nSecond, we might adopt a more restrictive limit policy than\nGupta and Belnap adopt. Recall the question asked in Section 3: How\nshould we set \\(S_{\\eta}(d)\\) when \\(\\eta\\) is a limit ordinal? We\ngave a partial answer: any object that is stably true [false] up\nto that stage should be true [false] at that stage. We\nalso noted that for an object \\(d \\in D\\) that does not stabilize up\nto the stage \\(\\eta\\), Gupta and Belnap 1993 allow us to set\n\\(S_{\\eta}(d)\\) as either \\(\\mathbf{t}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{f}\\). In a\nsimilar context, Herzberger 1982a and 1982b assigns the value\n\\(\\mathbf{f}\\) to the unstable objects. And Gupta originally\nsuggested, in Gupta 1982, that unstable elements receive whatever\nvalue they received at the initial hypothesis \\(S_0\\).\n\nThese first two ways of amending the RTT both, in effect, restrict the\nnotion of a revision sequence, by putting constraints on which of\nour revision sequences really count as acceptable revision\nsequences. The constraints are, in some sense local: the first\nconstraint is achieved by putting restrictions on which hypotheses can\nbe used, and the second constraint is achieved by putting restrictions\non what happens at limit ordinals. A third option would be to put more\nglobal constraints on which putative revision sequences count as\nacceptable. Yaq\u016bb 1993 suggests, in effect, a limit rule whereby\nacceptable verdicts on unstable sentences at some limit stage \\(\\eta\\)\ndepend on verdicts rendered at other limit stages. Yaq\u016bb\nargues that these constraints allow us to avoid certain\n\u201cartifacts\u201d. For example, suppose that a ground model \\(M\n= \\langle D,I\\rangle\\) has two independent liars, by having two names\n\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), where \\(I(\\alpha) = \\neg\n\\boldsymbol{T}\\alpha\\) and \\(I(\\beta) = \\neg \\boldsymbol{T}\\beta\\).\nYaq\u016bb argues that it is a mere \u201cartifact\u201d of the\nrevision semantics, naively presented, that there are revision\nsequences in which the sentence \\(\\neg \\boldsymbol{T}\\alpha \\equiv\n\\neg \\boldsymbol{T}\\beta\\) is stably true, since the two liars are\nindependent. His global constraints are developed to rule out such\nsequences. (See Chapuis 1996 for further discussion.)\n\nThe first and the second way of amending the RTT are in some sense put\ntogether by Campbell-Moore (2019). Here, the notion of stability for\nobjects is extended to sets of hypotheses: A set \\(H\\) of hypotheses\nis stable in a sequence \\(S\\) of hypotheses if for some ordinal\n\\(\\theta\\) all hypotheses \\(S_{\\zeta}\\), with \\(\\zeta \\ge \\theta\\),\nbelong to \\(H\\). With this, we can introduce the notion of\n\\(P\\)-revision sequence: If \\(P\\) is a class of sets of hypotheses, a\nsequence \\(S\\) is a \\(P\\)-revision sequence just in case that, at\nevery limit ordinal \\(\\eta\\), if a set of hypotheses \\(H\\) belongs to\n\\(P\\) and is stable in \\(S\\), then \\(S_{\\eta}\\) belongs to \\(H\\). It\ncan be shown that, for a suitable choice of \\(P\\), all limit stages of\n\\(P\\)-revision sequences are maximal consistent\nhypotheses.\n5.4 Revision theory for circularly defined concepts\n\nAs indicated in our discussion, in Section 4, of the \u2018iff\u2019\nin the T-biconditionals, Gupta and Belnap present the RTT as a special\ncase of a revision theory of circularly defined concepts. To\nreconsider the example from Section 4. Suppose that \\(L\\) is a\nlanguage with a unary predicate F and a binary predicate R. Consider a\nnew concept expressed by a predicate \\(G\\), introduced through a\ndefinition, \\(D\\), like this: \n\\[\nGx =_{df} A(x,G)\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(A(x,G)\\) is the formula \n\\[\n\\forall y(Ryx \\supset Fx) \\vee \\exists y(Ryx \\amp Gx).\n\\]\n\n\nIn this context, a ground model is a classical model \\(M =\n\\langle D,I\\rangle\\) of the language \\(L\\): we start with a domain of\ndiscourse, \\(D\\), and an interpretation of the predicate \\(F\\) and the\nrelation symbol \\(R\\). We would like to extend \\(M\\) to an\ninterpretation of the language \\(L + G\\). So, in this context, an\nhypothesis will be thought of as an hypothesized extension for the\nnewly introduced concept \\(G\\). Formally, a hypothesis is simply a\nfunction \\(h:D \\rightarrow \\{\\mathbf{t}, \\mathbf{f}\\}\\). Given a\nhypothesis \\(h\\), we take \\(M+h\\) to be the classical model \\(M+h =\n\\langle D,I'\\rangle\\), where \\(I'\\) interprets \\(F\\) and \\(R\\) in the\nsame way as \\(I\\), and where \\(I'(G) = h\\). Given a hypothesized\ninterpretation \\(h\\) of \\(G\\), we generate a new interpretation of\n\\(G\\) as follows: and object \\(d \\in D\\) is in the new extension of\n\\(G\\) just in case the defining formula \\(A(x,G)\\) is true of \\(d\\) in\nthe model \\(M+h\\). Formally, we use the ground model \\(M\\) and the\ndefinition \\(D\\) to define a revision rule, \\(\\delta_{D,M}\\),\nmapping hypotheses to hypotheses, i.e., hypothetical interpretations\nof \\(G\\) to hypothetical interpretations of \\(G\\). In particular, for\nany formula \\(B\\) with one free variable \\(x\\), and \\(d \\in D\\), we\ncan define the truth value \\(\\textit{Val}_{M+h,d}(B)\\) in the standard\nway. Then, \n\\[\n\\delta_{D,M}(h)(d) = \\textit{Val}_{M+h,d}(A)\n\\]\n\n\nGiven a revision rule \\(\\delta_{D,M}\\), we can generalize the notion\nof a revision sequence, which is now a sequence of\nhypothetical extensions of \\(G\\) rather than \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\). We\ncan generalize the notion of a sentence \\(B\\) being stably\ntrue, nearly stably true, etc., relative to a revision\nsequence. Gupta and Belnap introduce the systems \\(\\mathbf{S}^*\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{S}^{\\#}\\), analogous to \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\), as\n follows:[11]\n\nDefinition 5.1.\n\nA sentence \\(B\\) is valid on the definition \\(D\\) in\nthe ground model \\(M\\) in the system \\(\\mathbf{S}^*\\)\n(notation \\(M \\vDash_{*,D} B)\\) iff \\(B\\) is stably true relative to\neach revision sequence for the revision rule \\(\\delta_{D,M}\\).\nA sentence \\(B\\) is valid on the definition \\(D\\) in\nthe ground model \\(M\\) in the system \\(\\mathbf{S}^{\\#}\\)\n(notation \\(M \\vDash_{\\#,D} B)\\) iff \\(B\\) is nearly stably\ntrue relative to each revision sequence for the revision rule\n\\(\\delta_{D,M}\\).\nA sentence \\(B\\) is valid on the definition \\(D\\) in\nthe system \\(\\mathbf{S}^*\\) (notation \\(\\vDash_{*,D} B)\\) iff for\nall classical ground models \\(M\\), we have \\(M \\vDash_{*,D} B\\).\nA sentence \\(B\\) is valid on the definition \\(D\\) in\nthe system \\(\\mathbf{S}^{\\#}\\) (notation \\(\\vDash_{\\#,D} B)\\) iff\nfor all classical ground models \\(M\\), we have \\(M \\vDash_{\\#,D}\nB\\).\n\n\n\nOne of Gupta and Belnap\u2019s principle open questions is whether\nthere is a complete calculus for these systems: that is, whether, for\neach definition \\(D\\), either of the following two sets of sentences\nis recursively axiomatizable: \\(\\{B:\\vDash_{*,D} B\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{B:\\vDash_{\\#,D} B\\}\\). Kremer 1993 proves that the answer is no:\nhe shows that there is a definition \\(D\\) such that each of these sets\nof sentences is of complexity at least \\(\\Pi^{1}_2\\), thereby putting\na lower limit on the complexity of \\(\\mathbf{S}^*\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{S}^{\\#}\\). (Antonelli 1994a and 2002 shows that this is also\nan upper limit.)\n\nKremer\u2019s proof exploits an intimate relationship between\ncircular definitions understood revision-theoretically and\ncircular definitions understood as inductive definitions: the\ntheory of inductive definitions has been quite well understood for\nsome time. In particular, Kremer proves that every inductively defined\nconcept can be revision-theoretically defined. The expressive power\nand other aspects of the revision-theoretic treatment of circular\ndefinitions is the topic of much interesting work: see Welch 2001,\nL\u00f6we 2001, L\u00f6we and Welch 2001, and K\u00fchnberger et\nal. 2005.\n\nAlongside Kremer\u2019s limitative result there is the positive\nobservation that, for some semantic system of definitions based on\nrestricted kinds of revision sequences, sound and complete calculi\ndo exist. For instance, Gupta and Belnap give some examples\nof calculi and revision-theoretic systems which use only finite\nrevision sequences. Further investigation on proof-theoretic calculi\ncapturing some revision-theoretic semantic systems is done in Bruni\n2013, Standefer 2016, Bruni 2019, and Fjellstad 2020.\n5.5 Axiomatic Theories of Truth and the Revision Theory\n\nThe RTT is a clear example of a semantically motivated theory of\ntruth. Quite a different tradition seeks to give a satisfying\naxiomatic theory of truth. Granted we cannot retain all of classical\nlogic and all of our intuitive principles regarding truth, especially\nif we allow vicious self-reference. But maybe we can arrive at\nsatisfying axiom systems for truth, that, for example, maintain\nconsistency and classical logic, but give up only a little bit when it\ncomes to our intuitive principles concerning truth, such as the\nT-biconditionals (interpreted classically); or maintain consistency\nand all of the T-biconditionals, but give up only a little bit of\nclassical logic. Halbach 2011 comprehensively studies such axiomatic\ntheories (mainly those that retain classical logic), and Horsten 2011\nis in the same tradition. Both Chapter 14 of Halbach 2011 and Chapter\n8 of Horsten 2011 study the relationship between the Friedman-Sheard\ntheory FS and the revision semantics, with some interesting results.\nFor more work on axiomatic systems and the RTT, see Horsten et al\n2012.\n\nField 2008 makes an interesting contribution to axiomatic theorizing\nabout truth, even though most of the positive work in the book\nconsists of model building and is therefore semantics. In particular,\nField is interested in producing a theory as close to classical logic\nas possible, which retains all T-biconditionals (the conditional\nitself will be nonclassical) and which at the same time can express,\nin some sense, the claim that such and such a sentence is defective.\nField uses tools from multivalued logic, fixed-point semantics, and\nrevision theory to build models showing, in effect, that a very\nattractive axiomatic system is consistent. Field\u2019s construction\nis an intricate interplay between using fixed-point constructions for\nsuccessively interpreting T, and revision sequences for successively\ninterpreting the nonclassical conditional \u2014 the final\ninterpretation being determined by a sort of super-revision-theoretic\nprocess.\n\nThe connection between revision and Field\u2019s theory is explored\nfurther in Standefer 2015b and in Gupta and Standefer 2017.\n5.6 Applications\n\nGiven Gupta and Belnap\u2019s general revision-theoretic treatment of\ncircular definitions \u2014 of which their treatment of\ntruth is a special case \u2014 one would expect\nrevision-theoretic ideas to be applied to other concepts. Antonelli\n1994b applies these ideas to non-well-founded sets: a non-well-founded\nset \\(X\\) can be thought of as circular, since, for some \\(X_0 ,\n\\ldots ,X_n\\) we have \\(X \\in X_0 \\in \\ldots \\in X_n \\in X\\). Chapuis\n2003 applies revision-theoretic ideas to rational decision making.\nThis connection is further developed by Bruni 2015 and by Bruni and\nSillari 2018. For a discussion of revision theory and abstract objects\nsee Wang 2011. For a discussion of revision theory and vagueness, see\nAsmus 2013.\n\nStandefer (2015a) studies the connection between the circular\ndefinitions of revision theory and a particular modal logic RT (for\n\u201cRevision Theory\u201d). Campbell-Moore et al. 2019\nand Campbell-Moore 2021 use revision sequences to model probabilities\nand credences, respectively. Cook 2019 employs a revision-theoretic\nanalysis to find a new possible solution of Benardete\u2019s version\nof the Zeno paradox.\n\nIn recent times, there has been increasing interest in bridging the\ngap between classic debates on the nature of truth \u2014\ndeflationism, the correspondence theory, minimalism, pragmatism, and\nso on \u2014 and formal work on truth, motivated by the liar\u2019s\nparadox. The RTT is tied to pro-sententialism by Belnap 2006;\ndeflationism, by Yaq\u016bb 2008; and minimalism, by Restall 2005.\n\nWe must also mention Gupta 2006. In this work, Gupta argues that an\nexperience provides the experiencer, not with a straightforward\nentitlement to a proposition, but rather with a hypothetical\nentitlement: as explicated in Berker 2011, if subject S has experience\n\\(e\\) and is entitled to hold view \\(v\\) (where S\u2019s\nview is the totality of S\u2019s concepts, conceptions, and\nbeliefs), then S is entitled to believe a certain class of perceptual\njudgements, \\(\\Gamma(v)\\). (Berker uses \u201cpropositions\u201d\ninstead of \u201cperceptual judgements\u201d in his formulation.)\nBut this generates a problem: how is S entitled to hold a view? There\nseems to be a circular interdependence between entitlements to views\nand entitlements to perceptual judgements. Here, Gupta appeals to a\ngeneral form of revision theory \u2014 generalizing beyond both the\nrevision theory of truth and the revision theory of circularly defined\nconcepts (Section 5.4, above) \u2014 to given an account of how\n\u201chypothetical perceptual entitlements could yield categorical\nentitlements\u201d (Berker 2011).\n5.7 An open question\n\nWe close with an open question about \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\). Recall Definition 3.11, above, which defines when\na sentence \\(A\\) of a truth language \\(L\\) is valid in the ground\nmodel \\(M\\) by \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) or by\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\). We will say that \\(A\\) is valid by\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) [alternatively, by \\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\)] iff\n\\(A\\) is valid in the ground model \\(M\\) by \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\)\n[alternatively, by \\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\)] for every ground model \\(M\\).\nOur open question is this: What is the complexity of the set of\nsentences valid by \\(\\mathbf{T}^* [\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\)]?",
