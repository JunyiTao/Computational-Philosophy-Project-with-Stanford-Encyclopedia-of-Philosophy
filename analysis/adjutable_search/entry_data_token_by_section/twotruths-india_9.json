    "main_text": "Madhyamaka\n4. Madhyamaka\n\nAfter the Buddha the philosopher who broke new ground on the theory of\nthe two truths in the Madhyamaka system is a South Indian monk,\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna (ca. 100 BCE\u2013100 CE). Amongst his seminal\nphilosophical works delineating the theory are\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\n\nFundamental Verses on the Middle Way\n(M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101 [MMK],\nSeventy Verses on Emptiness\n(\u015aunyat\u0101saptati),\nRebutting the Disputes\n (Vigrahvy\u0101vartan\u012b[9]\n and\nSixty Verses on Logical Reasoning\n(Yukti\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dik\u0101).\n\n\n\u0100ryadeva\u2019s work\nCatu\u1e25\u015bataka\u1e63\u0101strak\u0101rik\u0101\n(Four Hundred Verses) is also considered as one of the\nfoundational texts delineating Madhyamaka\u2019s theory of the two\ntruths.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna saw himself as propagating the dharma taught by\nthe Buddha, which he says is precisely based on the theory of the two\ntruths: a truth of mundane conventions and a truth of the ultimate.\n([MMK] 24.8, Dbu ma tsa 14b\u201315a) He saw the theory of\nthe two truths as constituting the Buddha\u2019s core teaching and his\nphilosophy. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna maintains therefore that those who do\nnot understand the distinction between these two truths would fail to\nunderstand the Buddha\u2019s teaching ([MMK] 24.9, Dbu ma tsa\n15a). This is so, for N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, because (1) without relying\non the conventional truth, the meaning of the ultimate cannot be\nexplained, and (2) without understanding the meaning of the ultimate,\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a is not achieved ([MMK] 24.10, Dbu ma tsa\n15a).\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s theory of the two truths is fundamentally\ndifferent from all theories of truth in other Indian philosophies.\nHindu philosophers of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika,\nS\u0101\u1e43kya-Yoga, and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101-Ved\u0101nta\u2014all advocate a\nfoundationalism of some kind according to which ultimate reality is\ntaken to be \u201csubstantive reality\u201d (drayva) or foundation\nupon which stands the entire edifice of the conventional ontological\nstructures where the ultimate reality is posited as immutable, fixed,\nirreducible and independent of any interpretative conventions. That is\nso, even though the conventional structure that stands upon it\nconstantly changes and transforms.\n\nAs we saw the Buddhist realism of the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and the\nrepresentationalism of the Sautr\u0101ntika both advocate ultimate\ntruth as ultimately real, logically irreducible. The idealism of\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra holds nondual mind as the only ultimate reality and\nthe external world as merely conventional truths. On\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s Madhyamaka all things including ultimate truth\nare ultimately unreal, empty (\u015b\u016bnya) of any intrinsic nature\n(svabh\u0101va) including the emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101)\nitself, therefore all are groundless. In this sense a M\u0101dhyamika\n(a proponent of the Madhyamaka thought) is a an advocate of the\nemptiness (\u015b\u016bnyav\u0101din), advocate of the intrinsic\nunreality (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101vav\u0101din), groundlessness,\nessencelessness, or carelessness. Nevertheless to assert that all\nthings are empty of any intrinsic reality, for N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, is\nnot to undermine the existential status of things as simply\nnothing. On the contrary, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues, to\nassert that the things are empty of any intrinsic reality is to\nexplain the way things really are as causally conditioned phenomena\n(prat\u012btyasamputpa\u1e45h\u0101).\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s central argument to support his radical\nnon-foundationalist theory of the two truths draws upon an\nunderstanding of conventional truth as tied to dependently arisen\nphenomena, and ultimate truth as tied to emptiness of the intrinsic\nnature. Since the former and the latter are co-constitutive of each\nother, in that each entials the other, ultimate reality is tied to\nbeing that which is conventionally real. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna advances\nimportant arguments justifying the correlation between conventional\ntruth vis-\u00e0-vis dependent arising, and emptiness\nvis-\u00e0-vis ultimate truth. These arguments bring home their\nepistemological and ontological correlations ([MMK] 24.14; Dbu\nma tsa 15a). He argues that wherever applies emptiness as the\nultimate reality, there applies the causal efficacy of conventional\nreality and wherever emptiness does not apply as the ultimate reality,\nthere does not apply the causal efficacy of conventional reality\n(Vig.71) (Dbu ma tsa 29a). According to\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna, ultimate reality\u2019s being empty of any intrinsic\nreality affords conventional reality its causal efficacy since being\nultimately empty is identical to being causally produced,\nconventionally. This must be so since, for N\u0101g\u0101rjuna,\n\u201cthere is no thing that is not dependently arisen; therefore,\nthere is no such thing that is not empty\u201d ([MMK] 24.19, Dbu\nma tsa 15a).\n\nSv\u0101tantrika / Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika and the two\ntruths\n\nThe theory of the two truths in the Madhyamaka in India took a great\nresurgence from the fifth century onwards soon after Buddhap\u0101lita\n(ca. 470\u2013540) wrote A Commentary on [N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s]\nFundamental Verses of the Middle Way\n\n(Buddhap\u0101litam\u016blamadhyamakav\u1e5btti,[10]Dbu\n ma tsa 158b\u2013281a). Set forth in this text is a\nthoroughgoing non-foundationalist philosophic reasoning and\nmethod\u2014pr\u0101sa\u1e45ga arguments or reductio ad\nabsurdum style without relying upon the svatantra,\nformal probative argument\u2014to elucidate the Madhyamaka\nmetaphysics and epistemology ingrained in theory of the two truths.\nFor this reason, Buddhap\u0101lita is often identified later as the\nfounder of the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka, although elucidation\nof the theory itself is set out in the works of Candrak\u012brti.\nThree decades later\n Bh\u0101vaviveka[11]\n (ca. 500\u2013570) challenged Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s interpretation of\nthe two truths, and developed a Madhyamaka account of the two truths\nthat reflects a significant ontological and epistemological shift from\nBuddhapalit\u0101\u2019s position, which was later defended in the works of\nCandrak\u012brti to whom we shall return shortly.\n\nMany later commentators ignore the philosophical contents of the\ndebate between the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika and the Sv\u0101tantrika and\nclaim that their controversy is confined only to pedagogical or\nmethodological issues. There is another view according to which the\ncontents of the debate between the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika and the\nSv\u0101tantrika\u2014Buddhap\u0101lita versus Bh\u0101vavevika\nfollowed by Bh\u0101vavevika versus Candrak\u012brti\u2014is\nessentially philosophic in nature. Underpinning the dialectical or\nmethodological controversy between the two Madhyamaka camps lies a\ndeeper ontological and epistemological divide implied within their\ntheories of the two truths, and this in turn is reflected in the\ndifferent methodological considerations they each deploy. So on this\nsecond view, the variation in the methods used by the two schools of\nthe Madhyamaka are not simple differences in their rhetorical devices\nor pedagogical tools, they are underlain by more serious philosophical\ndisagreements between the two.\n\nAccording to this view the philosophical differentiations between the\nSv\u0101tantrika and the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika is best contained\nwithin the discourse of the two truths. Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s theory\nof the two truths we leave aside for the time being. First we shall\ntake up the Sv\u0101tantrika\u2019s account.\n",
