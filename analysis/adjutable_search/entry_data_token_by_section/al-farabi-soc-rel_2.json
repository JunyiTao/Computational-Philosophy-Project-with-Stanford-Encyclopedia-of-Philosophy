    "main_text": "What is \u2018philosophy of society\u2019? || The preconditions of happiness\n2.2 The preconditions of happiness\n\nAs the last citation from the Perfect State conveys, when\ndiscussing the preconditions of felicity, al-Farabi distinguishes\nbetween (a) common and (b) specific duties of the\ncitizens, as well as between (i) knowledge and (ii)\nactivities. His most detailed indications concerning these\npreconditions address (a.i) the common things that everyone\nmust know and are spelled out in the following list:\n\n\nThe things in common which all the people of the excellent city ought\nto know are: (1) In the first place to know the First Cause and all\nits qualities; (2) then the immaterial existents [including the above\nmentioned active intellect] \u2026; (3) the celestial substances\n\u2026; (4) [without number in Walzer\u2019s translation] then the\nnatural bodies which are beneath them, and how they come to be and\npass away \u2026; (5) then the generation of man; (6) then the first\nruler \u2026; (7) then the rulers who have to take his place\n\u2026; (8) then the excellent city and its people and the felicity\nwhich their souls ultimately reach \u2026. (Perfect State\nV, 17, 1: 277\u20139)\n\n\nFrom this list it follows that al-Farabi presupposes a quite profound\nknowledge of cosmology, physics, anthropology, and philosophy of\nsociety. This is rather astounding in view of the fact that, as he\nhimself admits, only a minority of people are sufficiently gifted\nintellectually to do science, which is to say, to understand those\nthings al-Farabi mentions in his\n list.[12]\n This raises the question of whether or not felicity is in effect\nattainable by everyone, a question that will be pursued in\n section 3.2\n of this entry. Regarding the preconditions of happiness, however, it\ncan be concluded that, as far as the common knowledge requirements\n(a.i) are concerned, al-Farabi sets the bar fairly high: only\naccomplished philosophers will be able to fulfill these criteria.\n\nAs for the remaining preconditions, al-Farabi is far less explicit.\nThere are some indications regarding the common activities\n(a.ii). It appears that, once again in unison with Aristotle,\nthese embrace all sorts of exercises suited to purify one\u2019s soul\nwhile it is still unified with \u2018its\u2019 body, as\nal-Farabi\u2019s references to the soul\u2019s disposition as well\nas his recurrent comparisons with arts and crafts suggest. Thus, he\nintimates, in connection with the last quoted passage:\n\n\nWhen each of [the people of the excellent city] acts in this way\n[i.e., according to the citizens\u2019 common duties], these actions\nof his make him acquire a good and excellent disposition of the soul,\nand the more steadily he applies himself to them, the stronger and\nbetter becomes that disposition of this and increases in strength and\nexcellence\u2014just as steadily applying himself to performing the\nactions of writing well make a man acquire proficiency in the art of\nwriting \u2026. (Perfect State V, 16, 2: 261)\n\n\nIn the background of this notion of acquiring a better psychic\ndisposition by virtue of repeatedly performing certain activities, is\n(in addition to Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics) the\nancient medical tradition. Accordingly, even the (immaterial) rational\nfaculty of the soul can be positively affected, if those faculties of\nthe soul which operate by virtue of corporeal organs (such as sense\nperception and imagination) are improved. This concerns, at the most\nbasic level, the mixture of the temperaments, which is directly\nrelated to the nutritive faculty: the better one\u2019s temperaments\nare in balance, the fewer are the negative influences by the body on\nthe soul, and the more easily this human being will, hence, be able to\nuse her rational faculty. On a slightly more complex level, this idea\nof balance or harmony as a means to purify the soul also concerns the\nrealm of moral virtues. For while one\u2019s character is\nfundamentally predisposed by her temperament, al-Farabi maintains that\nvirtues can be trained and improved. Thus, just as keeping the bodily\nhumors in check, being able to find the \u2018golden mean\u2019 in\nethical matters usually prepares the ground for a swifter and less\ndistracted application of one\u2019s rational\n faculty.[13]\n\nThat al-Farabi in fact envisages moral virtues as one of the\npreconditions of individual happiness, is further corroborated by his\nassessment of deficient cities and societies. Among these communities\nare the \u201cimmoral cities\u201d whose inhabitants, despite\nknowing better, \u201cthrough their passion and will [are] inclined\ntoward\u201d what al-Farabi considers to be wrong or presumed goods,\nsuch as \u201cstatus, honor, domination\u201d (Political\nRegime C, 3, 120: 90; cf. also Book of Religion 11:\n101), which distract from humanity\u2019s natural telos.\nOther examples of misguided ambitions include the quest for \u201cthe\nenjoyment of pleasures\u201d imagined to be found in gluttony,\ndrinking, and sexual intercourse (Political Regime C, 3, 119:\n89). Al-Farabi\u2019s verdict regarding these communities is\nunambiguous: \u201cNo one at all among the inhabitants of these\ncities gains happiness\u201d (ibid. 120: 90). As these examples and\nal-Farabi\u2019s assessment evince, just like the balance of\none\u2019s temperaments, her character is significant in the pursuit\nof happiness not for its own sake, but insofar as it fulfills a\npreparatory task. It prepares the human being\u2019s soul so that it\ncan, to the best of its ability, perform its proper activity, i.e.,\nreasoning.\n\nRegarding, finally, those things which citizens are supposed to know\nand do in accordance with their respective classes (referred to as\n b.i and b.ii above,\n first paragraph of this section), al-Farabi seems to think of the\nvarious trades and professions performed in the\n polis.[14]\n As the next section will reveal, he differentiates between the\nindividual skills and weaknesses with which each human being is born.\nHe is convinced that, equipped with these specific talents, each human\nbeing possesses her natural place and duty within society. Actualizing\nher individual potential to the best of her capacities, hence,\ncontributes to the functioning and well-being of the community. This,\nin fact, does not immediately lead towards individual happiness, but\nis a necessary precondition as it contributes to covering the daily\nneeds and, thus, warranting the basis for society to aspire for its\nown natural telos (see\n section 1\n above).\n",
