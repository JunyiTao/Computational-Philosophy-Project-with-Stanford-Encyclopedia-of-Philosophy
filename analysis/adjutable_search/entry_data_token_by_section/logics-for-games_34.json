    "main_text": "Interfacing Logic and Probability in Games || From Logic to Probability and Back\n5.2 From Logic to Probability and Back\n\nOn a received view, logical and probabilistic frameworks emphasize\ndifferent aspects of belief. Logic emphasizes coherence properties\nbetween the propositions believed, such as closure under logical\nimplications or conjunction. Probabilistic reasoning, on the other\nhand, stresses graded information and attitudes towards uncertain\nevents such as lotteries. Even so, there is a variety of approaches\nattempting to unify the two types of reasoning by constructing bridges\nbetween the frameworks.\n\nFrom qualitative to quantitative probability Early\nattempts in this direction go back to Finetti\n(1970 [1974]), striving for a purely qualitative axiomatization\nof probability theory. A step further towards logical reasoning are\nvarious theories of qualitative probability (Kyburg\n1994), often based on the assumption\nthat classical quantitative notions of probability are too demanding\nfor real-life agents. In this line of research agents need only reason\nwith partial, comparative probability assessments, rather than having\nfully specified probabilities for all events. Logical frameworks for\nqualitative probability include Segerberg\n(1971), Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo (1990), and Delgrande\nand Renne (2015). While differing in\ndetail, all logics in this line have in common that they allow for\nexpressions of the form \\(\\varphi\\preceq\\psi\\), indicating that\n\\(\\psi\\) is judged at least as probable at \\(\\varphi\\). Recent\nframeworks add various additional refinements to this language.\nSimilarly, Heifetz and Mongin (2001)\nexpand the axiomatic analysis of probabilistic beliefs to higher order\nreasoning, working on probabilistic type space akin to those\nintroduced in\n Section 3.7.\n\nYet, the concept of qualitative probability is sometimes considered\nflawed: a complete set of probabilistic-logical principles\nguaranteeing that every complete description in the logical language\ncorresponds to a unique probability measure turns out to require a\ncomplex calculus, involving an opaque infinite rule (Kraft,\nPratt, & Seidenberg 1959; Scott\n1964). A new angle has been proposed in Harrison-Trainor,\nHolliday, and Icard (2016) and\nDing, Holliday, and Icard (2021)  through axiomatizing a\nlow-complexity qualitative probabilistic logic that emerges from\nrelaxing the above unique correspondence requirement to merely\nrequiring compatibility with all probability measures of a certain\nfamily.\n\nHowever, none of the frameworks described here are specific for games.\nIn fact, it remains to be seen whether qualitative probabilistic\nlogics, old or recent, can be used for a qualitative analysis of\ngame-theoretic solution concepts.\n\nFrom quantitative to qualitative probability While\nthe preceding line of research aims at recovering quantitative\nprobability from qualitative notions, a converse project shows how\nubiquitous qualitative patterns might arise naturally within a\nquantitative probabilistic setting. Building on what is sometimes\ndubbed the Lockean Thesis, threshold approaches connect\nprobability to logic by stipulating that some \\(\\varphi\\) is to be\nbelieved simpliciter if the probability of \\(\\varphi\\) is above some\nappropriate numerical threshold t. For most choices of\nthreshold t, such translations do not square well with standard\nlogical desiderata, as beliefs will in general not be closed under\nconjunction. However, in recent work Leitgeb\n(2017) and Lin and Kelly (2012)\nhave identified conditions under which one can do better. Building on\nideas of Skyrms (1977), Leitgeb\nidentifies strong, context-dependent\n\u2018robustness conditions\u2019 on thresholds that guarantee the\ndefined belief operator to satisfy the KD45 axioms after all. Lin\nand Kelly, on the other hand, work with\nnon-uniform thresholds for transitioning between logical and\nprobabilistic notions of belief, allowing to derive coherence between\ndifferent forms of belief dynamics on the two sides. For a recent\nstudy of the mathematical foundations and limits of these approaches,\nas well as the conditional logics they generate see Mierzewski\n(2020).\n",
