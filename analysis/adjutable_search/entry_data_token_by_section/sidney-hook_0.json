Sidney Hook\u2019s Adoption of Pragmatism: from the Justification of Naturalistic Metaphysics to the Commitment to Scientific Method\n\nHook studied philosophy as an undergraduate at the City College of New\nYork in the early 1920s, where he was influenced by Morris Raphael\nCohen. He then attended Columbia University, where he earned a PhD\nunder the supervision of John Dewey. As the background for the\ndevelopment of Hook\u2019s thought, the philosophical and\nintellectual discussion of this period was dominated by the reigning\npower of Deweyan pragmatism even as it also showed the emerging signs\nof the coming influence of Marxism. One illustration of the\nsignificance of Dewey for Hook\u2019s intellectual development can be\nfound in the fact that the completion of Dewey\u2019s attempt to\nproduce a naturalist metaphysics, Experience and Nature, took\nplace in the mid-twenties and Sidney Hook\u2019s doctoral\ndissertation, The Metaphysics of Pragmatism, was defended in\n1927.\n\nHook\u2019s study of the metaphysics of pragmatism placed his work\nwithin a series of successive reconsiderations by pragmatic\nphilosophers of the relationship between the nature of metaphysical\ninquiry and a commitment to scientific method. The founding fathers of\npragmatism in the United States, Charles Peirce and William James, had\neach presented pragmatism as a criticism of metaphysics.\n\nIn his two essays that founded pragmatism as a philosophical movement,\nPeirce argued that the experimental methods of the natural sciences\nprovided the proper the model for philosophical inquiry. He understood\nthe scientific method to be opposed to the methods used in traditional\nmetaphysics which were identified by him with Cartesian rationalism\nand rationalist intuitionism. Further, Peirce\u2019s account of the\nnature of \u201cbelief\u201d could be interpreted as leading to a\ncomplete rejection of all metaphysical hypotheses on the ground that,\nas they are not verifiable by the methods of scientific inquiry,\nmetaphysical beliefs were properly considered \u201cmeaningless\ngibberish.\u201d\n\nIn a different idiom, James had criticized both the metaphysical\nMaterialism and the metaphysical Idealism that he took to be dominant\nin the latter part of the nineteenth century. James had argued that\nboth of these seemingly contrary philosophical hypotheses shared the\nphilosophical flaw inherent in the metaphysical approach that he\nidentified as a form of \u201clooking backward.\u201d James\nidentified traditional metaphysics with the method of searching for\nthe necessary presuppositions of empirical phenomena. This form of\n\u201clooking backward\u201d from the realm of contingent experience\nto a philosophical set of entities that necessarily existed, whether\nMaterialistic or Idealistic, was contrasted by James with the\npragmatic approach which looked to future experience. Accordingly, for\nJames, metaphysical claims were to be interpreted as hypotheses whose\nadoption or acceptance by an agent was justified only if it would lead\nto verifiable or confirmable consequences in future human experience.\nThis involved James in a redefinition of the nature of metaphysics,\nsince it transformed metaphysical claims into predictions regarding\nthe consequences for the human condition of adopting them. Thus the\npragmatism of both Peirce and James could be understood as calling for\nthe elimination of traditional metaphysics and replacing it with a\n\u201cscientific\u201dmetaphysics, metaphysics within the bounds of\nscientific methodology\n\nDewey had sought to build upon the insights of Peirce and James in\narguing for a naturalistic metaphysics. He stressed that scientific\ninquiry was an activity of human beings whose minds and intellectual\nhabits had emerged in natural evolutionary processes and that\nscientific inquiry was carried out in a natural environment so that\nits results were applied in the transformation of the conditions of\nnature. Along these lines, it seemed for Dewey that philosophers of\nlogic or science should be concerned not only with normative rules of\nlogical and scientific inquiry but also with the features of the\nnatural environment in which logical and scientific inquiry had taken\nplace. Accordingly, logical and epistemological inquiry involved the\nbroader investigation of the biological, psychological and\nsociological conditions of human knowledge. For pragmatism,\nnaturalistic metaphysics as an extension of such investigations\ninvolved an account and analysis of the most general and pervasive\nfeatures of human experience in its natural environment.\n\nIn Dewey\u2019s naturalistic metaphysics, then, a contextual and\nempirical account of the origin and function of human knowledge is\ncombined with a recognition of man\u2019s biological quest for\nadaptation to and control of his environment. This emphasis upon human\nadaptation and control characterized the recognition within pragmatic\nphilosophy of its debt to Darwinism in the development of its theory\nof mind\u2019s place in nature and of the nature of human\nknowledge.\n\nHook followed Dewey in stressing the connection between a naturalistic\nmetaphysics and the identification of human knowledge as an instrument\nin transforming the real nature of Nature. Significantly, this feature\nof naturalistic metaphysics heightened the pragmatic emphasis upon the\ncapacity of human agency to function as an activist transformer of the\nnatural environment. To a significant degree, what was natural,\nwhether in the sphere of the universe or the sphere of human affairs,\ncould be considered in the idiom of pragmatism not so much as a\n\u201cgiven,\u201d but as a possibility for a \u201ctaken.\u201d\nThe theme of human transformation of the natural environment carried\nHook from the initial interest in the metaphysics of pragmatism to the\npossibilities of pragmatism as a philosophy which could apply\nscientific method for social change.\n\nHook\u2019s analysis of the metaphysics of pragmatism focused on the\nissue of whether the practice of scientific method presupposed a set\nof beliefs about the world or any set of ontological commitments.\nAccording to Hook, the primacy of scientific method did not require\nany prior set of foundational metaphysical beliefs but was justified\ninstead by its consequences. Decades later, after the great emphasis\nascribed to the nature of Being in existentialist metaphysics, Hook\nreturned to an analysis of this issue in his essay \u201cThe Quest\nfor \u2018Being.\u2019\u201d He reaffirmed his earlier view that\nthe practice of scientific method did not presuppose a set of\nontological commitments or metaphysical theses about the world. Hook\nrecognized that an empirical analysis of experience and of the way\nscientific knowledge originated and functioned in the human\nenvironment could justify statements that represented the \u201cgreat\ncommonplaces\u201d of experience and of the world. These statements\ncould even be identified as \u201cempirical metaphysics\u201d in the\nsense that they asserted general traits about experience. From\nHook\u2019s perspective, however, these \u201cgreat\ncommonplaces\u201d did not constitute a set of metaphysical doctrines\nabout the nature of reality which could be demonstrated\nphilosophically or verified scientifically (Hook, The Quest for\nBeing, 1961, Part 3, \u201cThe Quest for\n\u2018Being\u2019\u201d).\n\nHook\u2019s account of the naturalist metaphysics of pragmatism was\ndriven by the longstanding focus among pragmatists on the interaction\nbetween human beings and their surroundings, and the potential of such\ninteractions to result in a transformation of both. Thus Hook\u2019s\naccount did not lead him into the thicket of the debates concerning\nthe elimination of metaphysics that were raging in the late 1920s and\nthroughout 1930s. It is worth noting that many of these debates are\nimplicit in the Peircean \u201cpragmatic maxim\u201d, which proposes\na verificationist criterion for the meaningfulness of a statement. As\nPeirce himself saw, and as the Logical Positivists would quickly come\nto see, it is difficult to make sense of \u201cverification\u201d\nwithout making reference to certain metaphysical concepts, including\nthose of counterfactual circumstances and unrealizable potential. In\ndifficulties such as these would lay the collapse of many of the more\nstringent forms of anti-metaphysics. However, Hook did not pursue the\nhard line criticisms of metaphysics that were implicit in pragmatism;\nrather, his intellectual interest shifted to the significance of the\npragmatic commitment to scientific method in other areas of\nphilosophy. Hook\u2019s subsequent philosophical activity was based\nupon his belief that the pragmatic commitment to scientific method had\ntransformative implications, primarily in three areas of philosophy:\nthe theory of knowledge, ethical theory, and social and political\nphilosophy.\n\nIn theory of knowledge, Hook defended the scientific method as the\nparadigmatic way in which human beings could achieve reliable\nknowledge. In ethical inquiry, Hook argued that the application of the\nscientific method was crucial for the justification of normative\nethical statements and for their confirmation as objectively true\nstatements.\n\nGiven his Deweyan commitment to socially-engaged philosophy, it is no\nwonder that in the late 1930s and throughout the 1940s and 1950s,\nHook\u2019s philosophical attention began turning increasingly\ntowards social and political philosophy. Here, too, Hook sought to\napply the scientific method. Hook\u2019s writings on educational\nreform, socialist theory, political protest, academic freedom, civil\nliberties, segregation, and ideology often engaged with social\nconcerns at a level of concreteness that had eluded Dewey. Though his\nviews on these social issues blend what appear to us today as\npolitically opposed categories, Hook claimed that his views reflected\na consistent and univocal philosophical commitment to the epistemic\nand moral experimentalism that lay at the core of pragmatism. Hook\nrecognized there was ample evidence that different political positions\nderived from divergent structures of perception which interpreted the\nempirical data in contradictory ways as well as from fixed attitudes\nwhich had been set through a person\u2019s life experience. To a\ndegree, he appreciated the significance of the dissimilarities in the\napplication of scientific method between the confirmation of an\nexperimental hypothesis in natural science by a community of inquiry\nand the empirical grounds that could be appealed to as providing a\njustification of a particular social or political policy in the\ncontext of decision-making in historical circumstances. Hook\ncontinued, both in his explicit thought about the nature of moral or\npolitical disagreement and in his implicit practice in discussion, to\nhold the pragmatic faith that critical intelligence \u2013 a\ngeneralized form of scientific method \u2013 could rationally resolve\nany conflict of opinion.\n",
