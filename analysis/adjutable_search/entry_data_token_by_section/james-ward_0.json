    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nJames Ward was born in Hull, Yorkshire, on 27th January 1843, as a\nson of James Ward, senior, a merchant with some scientific and\nphilosophical ambition (in a book entitled God, Man and the\nBible, he tried to give a scientific explanation of the Flood).\nHis father\u2019s enterprises were disastrous, however, so that lack\nof resources was to be a constant source of anxiety for the family,\nwhich included an uneducated, hard-working, deeply religious mother,\nsix sisters and a brother (another son died).\n\n\nAfter one of his father\u2019s bankruptcies, Ward remained for two\nyears without schooling and occupation. At the age of thirteen and a\nhalf, the boy was let free to occupy his time as he wished. In the\nsmall country town where his family had moved, Waterloo near Liverpool,\nhe developed a spirit of solitude and a love of nature. A\n\u2018Memoir\u2019 written by the philosopher\u2019s daughter, Olwen\nWard Campbell, enables us to get a glimpse of his life in these early\nyears: \u201cWaterloo was only a village in those days, and wild\nstretches of sandhills lay beyond it for many miles. Here he used to\nwander for hours on end, alone with his thoughts and the sea\nbirds\u201d (1927: 7).\n\n\nIn addition to the family\u2019s economic difficulties,\nWard\u2019s youth was shaped by the narrow Calvinistic faith in which\nhe was raised. In 1863 he entered Spring Hill College (later\nincorporated in Mansfield College, Oxford) with the aim of becoming a\nminister, but became increasingly skeptical of the doctrines he was\nexpected to preach. In the middle of his religious crisis, Ward moved\nto Germany for a temporary period of study. In G\u00f6ttingen, he\nattended lectures by one of the most influential philosophers of the\ntime, Rudolf Hermann Lotze. It is probably from Lotze that Ward gained\na first substantial appreciation of the philosophy of Leibniz, whose\ntheory of monads was later to provide the basis of his own\nmetaphysics.\n\n\nUpon returning to England, Ward made a sincere yet vain attempt to\nretain his faith and accepted a pastorate in Cambridge. His spiritual\ncrisis reached its climax and the point of no return in 1872, when he\ndefinitively abandoned the project of becoming a minister and applied\nas a non-collegiate student at Cambridge. One year later, he won a\nscholarship in Moral Science at Trinity College.\n\n\nImportant lessons were learned in the anguish of these vicissitudes\nand deliberations. In a letter to a friend, Ward writes: \u201cI am\ncoming to see more clearly every day that man is only half free, or\nrather that his freedom is not what I once thought it. It is not the\npower to choose anything, but only the power to choose between\nalternatives offered, and what these shall be circumstances determine\nquite as will\u201d (59). Surely, this insight owes more to the\nstruggle of existence than to abstract speculation. Interestingly,\nWard\u2019s mature philosophy comprises a defense of human freedom and\nsustains the idea that\u2014independently of circumstances outside of\nour control\u2014we always retain a capacity for responsible\naction.\n\n\nWard made the best out of the difficult challenge of beginning a new\nlife at the age of thirty. In 1874 he obtained a first in his Tripos;\none year later, he won a fellowship with a dissertation entitled\n\u2018The Relation of Physiology to Psychology,\u2019 part of which\nwas published in the first issue of Mind in 1876. These\nsuccesses marked the beginning of a distinguished career. He first\nbecame known for his article on \u2018Psychology\u2019 (1886) in the\nEncyclopaedia Britannica, in which he criticised Mill and\nBain\u2019s associationism, and in the years 1896\u201398 he delivered the\nprestigious Gifford Lectures, later published under the title\nNaturalism and Agnosticism (1899). In this book, Ward attacked\nthe various forms of scientific materialism that were current in the\nsecond half of the nineteenth century. The lectures were well received\nby his contemporaries and there was a widespread agreement that Ward\nhad been effective in his refutation. According to Alfred Edward\nTaylor, who reviewed the book in Mind in 1900, \u201cone may\nassert without much fear of contradiction that Prof. Ward\u2019s\nGifford Lectures are the philosophical book of the last year\u201d\n(Taylor 1900: 244).\n\n\nG. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell were among Ward\u2019s students at\nCambridge, where he had been elected to the new Chair of Mental\nPhilosophy and Logic in 1897. Moore has left a vivid testimony of his\npersonality and teaching style; as he recalls,\n\n\nWe sat around a table in his rooms at Trinity, and Ward had a large\nnotebook open on the table before him. But he did not read his\nlectures; he talked; and, while he talked, he was obviously thinking\nhard about the subject he was talking of and searching for the best way\nof putting what he wanted to convey. (Moore 1942: 17)\n\n\nMoore describes Ward as a melancholy personality, overwhelmed by the\ndifficulties of philosophical thinking\u2014\u2018Das Denken ist\nschwer\u2019 was one of his favorite sayings. (16) And while\nMoore was also impressed by Ward\u2019s \u2018extreme sincerity and\nconscientiousness\u2019 (18), Russell singles him out as one for whom\nhe had a \u2018great personal affection\u2019 (Russell 1946: 10).\n\n\nWard\u2019s reputation as a philosopher must have been very high, for he\nwas invited to deliver a second series of Gifford Lectures.  These\nwere held in the years 1907\u20131910 and published in 1911\nas The Realm of Ends or Pluralism and Theism; it is in this\nbook that he provides the most complete exposition of his idealistic\nmetaphysics.\n",
