What is Creativity?\n\nAs we noted at the outset, the term \u201ccreative\u201d can be\napplied to three kinds of things: a person, a\nprocess, or a product (where a product could be an\nidea, performance, or physical artifact).\n\nMost definitions focus on the product. According to one common\napproach, persons or processes are creative to the extent that they\nproduce creative products, and a product is creative if it meets two\nconditions: in addition to being new it must also be\nvaluable. Many theorists argue that novelty is not\nsufficient, because something can be new but worthless (e.g., a\nmeaningless string of letters), in which case it doesn\u2019t merit\nthe compliment of being called \u201ccreative\u201d. Immanuel Kant\nis often cited as anticipating this definition of creativity in his\ndiscussion of (artistic) genius. According to a common interpretation,\nKant defines (artistic) genius as the ability to produce works that\nare not only \u201coriginal\u201d\u2014since \u201cthere can be\noriginal nonsense\u201d\u2014but also \u201cexemplary\u201d (Kant\n1790: \u00a7\u00a743\u201350 [2000: 182\u2013197]). (Hills &\nBird [2018] challenge this reading of Kant.) This definition is so\nwidely accepted among psychologists that it has come to be known as\n\u201cthe standard definition\u201d of creativity in psychology. In\npractice, \u201ccreativity is often not defined\u201d (J.C.\nKaufman 2009: 19) in psychological experiments\u2014more on this in\n \u00a75\n below. When psychologists do explicitly adopt a definition, however,\nthey usually say that creative products are not only new, but also\nvaluable in some way, though they variously express the\nproduct\u2019s value in terms of its being \u201cuseful\u201d,\n\u201ceffective\u201d, \u201cworthwhile\u201d, \u201cfit\u201d,\nor \u201cappropriate to the task at hand\u201d (Bruner 1962: 18; A.\nJ. Cropley 1967: 67; Jackson & Messick 1965: 313; Kneller 1965: 7;\nCattell & Butcher 1968; Heinelt 1974; J.C. Kaufman 2009:\n19\u201320; S.B. Kaufman & Gregoire 2016; Stein 1953; Sternberg\n& Lubart 1999: 3\u2014for an overview, see Runco & Jaeger\n2012). A few psychologists have suggested that the standard definition\ndoesn\u2019t fully capture the concept of creativity (Amabile 1996;\nSimonton 2012b). As for philosophers, at least one of them defends the\nstandard definition with qualifications (Klausen 2010), but many of\nthem challenge it, as we\u2019ll soon see.\n\nWhile it is uncontroversial that novelty is required for creativity,\nphilosophers have refined that point. Certain examples may seem, at\nfirst, to suggest that novelty isn\u2019t really necessary for\ncreativity. Newton\u2019s discovery of calculus was creative even if,\nunbeknownst to him at the time, Leibniz got there first\u2014one of\nmany examples of what are called \u201cmultiples\u201d in the\nhistory of science (Simonton 2004). A beginning student\u2019s idea\nthat freedom is compatible with causal determinism might be creative\neven if, as she will soon learn, philosophers have been defending such\n\u201ccompatibilist\u201d theories for millennia. However, examples\nlike these do not force us to abandon the novelty requirement, but\nonly to qualify it. Newton\u2019s calculus and the student\u2019s\ncompatibilism were not new in all of history, but they were new to\ntheir respective creators, and that is enough for them to count as\ncreative. In the terminology of philosopher Margaret Boden, these\nideas are \u201cpsychologically creative\u201d (P-creative) even\nthough they are not \u201chistorically creative\u201d (H-creative).\nNotice that P-creativity is more fundamental. Anything that is new in\nall of history (H-creative) must also be new to its creator\n(P-creative). Thus, creativity always exhibits psychological novelty,\nthough it doesn\u2019t always exhibit historical novelty.\n\nAgain, no one denies that a creative product must be new, at least to\nits creator. But as we\u2019ll now see, some philosophers depart from\nthe standard definition of creativity by rejecting the value condition\n (\u00a72.1),\n or by proposing some further condition(s)\n (\u00a72.2),\n or by doing both.\n",
