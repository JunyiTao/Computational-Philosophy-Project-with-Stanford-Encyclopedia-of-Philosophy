Sources of the Doctrine of the Transcendentals\n\n\nThe Summa de bono of Philip the Chancellor (ca. 1225) is\nconsidered to be the first systematic formulation of a\ndoctrine of the transcendentals. (Aertsen 2012, 109\u2013127) But\nthere are some main sources that provided essential elements for the\ndoctrine.\n\n\nAristotle, e.g., gives an exemplary treatment of the relation\nbetween the concepts of \u2018being\u2019 and \u2018the one\u2019\nin the fourth book of his Metaphysics, where he explains that\njust as being is said in many ways, so also the one; consequently,\nthese notions share the same nature (phusis), while differing\nqua concept (logos). (Aristotle, Metaph. IV, c. 2, 1003 b\n23\u20134) In the tenth book of the Metaphysics, he explains that\nthe proper meaning of \u2018one\u2019 is \u2018indivisible\u2019,\nsuch that to be one is to be indivisible. (Arist., Metaph. X, c. 1,\n1052 b 16.) This model of pairing co-extensionality to intensional\ndifference was to provide the basic framework for a doctrine of the\ntranscendentals. Aristotle\u2019s indications of a focal meaning of\nbeing, which reduces the homonymy of the term in such a way as to\nsafeguard the unity of the subject of metaphysics and its possibility\nas a science (Arist., Metaph. IV, c. 2, 1003 a 32 sqq.), were the\nstarting-point for the medieval reflection on analogy as a mode of\npredication especially applying to transgeneric terms (cf. the entry on\n medieval theories of Analogy). Other important texts in\nthe corpus aristotelicum address the question of truth and the\nquestion of goodness. Aristotle\u2019s different assertions on the\nissue of truth confronted the Middle Ages with a tension. On the one\nhand, Aristotle asserted that each thing is related to truth in the\nsame way as it is to being; on the other hand, Aristotle excluded\nbeing-as-true from the consideration of metaphysics, since it is only a\nkind of intra-mental being. (Arist., Metaph. II, c. 1, 9993 b 30;\nMetaph. VI, c. 4, 1027 b 17 sqq.) In his critique of Plato\u2019s Idea\nof the Good, finally, Aristotle asserts that the good is said in as\nmany ways as being, and hence falls short of the univocity proper to a\nPlatonic idea. (Arist., Eth. Nic. I, c. 4, 1096 a 12 sqq.)\n\n\nAnother main source is the Persian thinker Ibn Sina (Lat. Avicenna),\nwho discusses the concepts of \u2018being\u2019, \u2018thing\u2019,\nand \u2018the one\u2019 as the primary conceptions of the intellect\nin his Metaphysics I.5. He introduces the idea of primary\nconceptions by drawing a seminal analogy between first principles in\nthe order of judgment and in the order of conception: just as there are\nfirst principles in the order of judgment, at which the reduction or\nanalysis of propositional knowledge comes to an end (e.g. the principle\nof non-contradiction), so there are also first principles in the order\nof conception, which are primitive in the sense that they cannot be\ndefined by appealing to some more general notion. Getting knowledge of\nthem is not making an unknown thing known, but bringing something to\nmind that was always already known, by means of logically derivative\n\u2018trigger\u2019-notions. The relation between the two most\nimportant primary conceptions \u2018being\u2019 and\n\u2018thing\u2019, which denote an existential resp. an essential\naspect of things, takes the form of a priority of \u2018thing\u2019\nor \u2018essence\u2019, to which \u2018being\u2019 is necessarily\nconcomitant. An important other innovation, directly related to the\nforegoing, was Ibn Sina\u2019s rejection of the theological\ninterpretation of the subject of metaphysics. Since the existence of\nthe subject of a science must be demonstrated beforehand, and\nGod\u2019s existence is to be demonstrated in the science of\nmetaphysics, God cannot be the subject of this science. Moreover, since\nmetaphysics is the first science, nothing else can be its subject,\nexcept for something that cannot be demonstrated, since it is\nself-evident. Hence, Ibn Sina\u2019s declarations that (1) being is a\nprimary conception and that (2) being is the subject of metaphysics are\ncorrelated.\n\n\nOther sources of the doctrines of the transcendentals are Augustine,\nBoethius, and Dionysius the Areopagite, representing the interpretation\nof the Platonic ideas as divine names in the Christian tradition. In\ndiverse works, Augustine discusses unity, truth, goodness, and being as\npredicates that are instantiated in a primary and privileged way in\nGod, and instantiated in a derivative way in God\u2019s creation. As a\nconsequence, knowledge of created unity, truth, goodness, and being has\nto make explicit this relation to its divine origin, which, in\nAugustine\u2019s work itself and in the Augustinian tradition,\nfrequently takes the form of an ascent to God as a demonstration of\nGod\u2019s existence. In his treatise De divinis nominibus,\npseudo-Dionysius Areopagita gives an extensive treatment of the Good,\nBeing, Truth, Beauty, and Unity as the names of God. Itself adherent to\nNeoplatonic philosophy, in which the Good is proclaimed to be above\nbeing, Dionysius\u2019 work was interpreted by 13th century\ntheoreticians of the doctrine of the transcendentals in the frame of a\nsynthesis of Aristotelianism and Platonism that harmonizes the\ntranscendent and the transcendental. Finally, Boethius explicitly\ndiscusses the convertibility of \u2018being\u2019 and\n\u2018one\u2019, and his treatise De hebdomadibus addresses\nthe relation between being and the good, with a view to safeguard the\ngoodness of reality without infringing upon the substantial goodness of\nits creator. One can say that De hebdomadibus was a true model\nfor the later elaboration of the doctrine of the transcendentals in the\nfirst half of the 13th century, which, in its first phase, had a strong\nfocus on the notion of the good.\n",
