    "main_text": "Roles of Imagination || Knowledge\n3.6 Knowledge\n\nImagination plays a role in the acquisition of knowledge. Many\nphilosophical arguments call on imagination when they appeal to\nmetaphysical modal knowledge (see the entry on\n epistemology of modality;\n the papers collected in Gendler & Hawthorne (eds.) 2002; and Kung\n2016 and Strohminger & Yli-Vakkuri 2017 for overviews). The kind\nof thought experiments that are regularly used in scientific\ntheorizing is also plausibly premised on imaginative capacities (see\nthe entry on\n thought experiments).\n As already discussed, people use imagination to understand the\nperspectives of others\n (section 3.1).\n Moreover, people often make decisions via thinking about\ncounterfactuals, or what would happen if things had been different\nfrom how they in fact are (see the entries on\n causation\n and\n counterfactual conditionals).\n However, the phenomenon of transformative experience has recently\ncalled into question which kind of imaginary scenarios are truly\nepistemically accessible. (For a representative collection of papers\nthat explore different epistemic roles of imagination, see Kind &\nKung (eds.) 2016a.)\n\nBroadly speaking, thought experiments use imaginary scenarios to\nelicit responses that (ideally) grant people knowledge of\npossibilities. A special, but prominent, type of thought experiment in\nphilosophy concerns the link between imagination, conceivability, and\nmetaphysical possibility. Ren\u00e9 Descartes famously offered a\nmodal argument in the Sixth Meditation, reasoning\nfrom the fact that he could clearly and distinctly conceive of his\nmind and body as distinct to the real distinctness between them. The\ncurrent prevalence of similar modal arguments can be verified by\nentries on\n zombies\n and\n dualism.\n These modal arguments all rely, in some way, on the idea that what\none can imagine functions as a fallible and defeasible guide to what\nis really possible in the broadest sense.\n\nPessimists, notably Peter Van Inwagen (1998: 70), doubt that\nimagination can give us an accurate understanding of scenarios that\nare \u201cremote from the practical business of everyday life\u201d,\nsuch as those called upon in philosophical modal arguments. Optimists\ntypically take it as a given that there is some connection between\nimagination and metaphysical modal knowledge, but focus on\nunderstanding where the connection is imperfect, such as when one\n(apparently) imagines the impossible. To just give a few examples,\nSaul Kripke (1972 [1980]), Stephen Yablo (1993), David Chalmers\n(2002), Dominic Gregory (2004), Timothy\nWilliamson (2007, 2016), Peter Kung (2010), and Magdalena Balcerak Jackson (2018) have each developed a distinctive approach to\nthis task. For example, Kripke adopts a redescription approach to\nmodeling (some) modal errors: in some cases where one is apparently\nimagining the impossible, one is in fact imagining a possible scenario\nbut misconstruing it as an impossible one. On this diagnosis, in such\ncases, the error resides not with imaginative capacities, but with the\ncapacity to describe one\u2019s own imaginings.\n\nOther thought experiments are scoped more narrowly; for example,\nscientific thought experiments are intended to allow people to explore\nnomic possibilities. Galileo (On Motion) famously offered a\nthought experiment that disproved Aristotle\u2019s theory of motion,\nwhich predicts that heavier objects fall more quickly. In this thought\nexperiment, Galileo asked people to imagine the falling of a composite\nof a light and heavy object versus the falling of the heavy object\nalone. When one runs the thought experiment\u2014that is, when one\nelaborates on the starting point of this imaginary scenario\u2014one\nnotices an incoherence in Aristotle\u2019s theory: on the one hand,\nit should predict that the composite would fall more slowly because\nthe light object would slow down the heavy object; on the other hand,\nit should also predict that the composite would fall more quickly\nbecause the composite is heavier than the heavy object alone. While it\nis incontrovertible that imagination is central to thought\nexperiments, debates remain on whether imagination can be invoked in\nthe context of justification (Gendler 2000b; Williamson 2016) or only\nin the context of discovery (Norton 1991, 1996; Spaulding 2016).\n\nThe role of imagination in counterfactual reasoning\u2014and, in\nparticular, the question of what tends to be held constant when one\ncontemplates counterfactual scenarios\u2014has been explored in\ndetail in recent philosophical and psychological works (Byrne 2005;\nWilliamson 2005, 2007, 2016). Williamson suggests that \n\n\nWhen we work out what would have happened if such-and-such had been\nthe case, we frequently cannot do it without imagining such-and-such\nto be the case and letting things run. (2005: 19) \n\n\nIt is imagination that lets one move from counterfactuals\u2019\nantecedents to their consequents. Williamson (2016) argues that our\nimaginings have evolved to be suitably constrained, such that such\ncounterfactual reasoning can confer knowledge. Indeed, he argues that\nif one were to be skeptical about gaining knowledge from such a\nhypothetical reasoning process, then one would be forced to be\n(implausibly) skeptical about much of ordinary reasoning about\nactuality. Developing an idea anticipated by Williamson (2007), Margot\nStrohminger and Juhani Yli-Vakkuri (forthcoming) argue that the same\nimaginative mechanisms that capable of producing metaphysical modal\nknowledge are also capable of producing knowledge of other restricted\nmodalities, such as nomic and practical modality. In parallel, Amy Kind (2016c, 2018) argues that imaginings can confer knowledge when they are guided by reality-sensitive constraints, in a manner akin to computer simulations.\n\nThinking about counterfactuals is just one way that imagination can\nfactor into mundane decision-making. Neil Van Leeuwen (2011, 2016a,\n2016b) and Bence Nanay (2016a) have recently started to elaborate on the connection\nbetween imagination and actions via decision-making. Although neither\nauthors focus on the epistemic status of imagination, their accounts\nof decision-making seem to suggest that imagination is used to gain\npractical knowledge about the probability and value of actions\u2019\npossible outcomes.\n\nAt the same time, the recently prominent discussion of transformative\nexperiences calls into question the extent to which imagination can be\nepistemically useful for making life-altering decisions. L.A. Paul\n(2014, 2015, 2018; see also Jackson 1982, 1986; D. Lewis 1988) argues\nthat some types of knowledge\u2014especially de se knowledge\nconcerning one\u2019s values\u2014are inaccessible by imaginings;\nonly actual experiences can confer these types of knowledge. For\nexample, one cannot really know whether one wants to become a parent\nwithout experiencing being a parent because parenthood itself can\ntransform one\u2019s values. If one cannot reasonably imagine oneself\nwith radically different values, then plausibly one cannot\nappropriately imagine the values associated with the outcomes of\none\u2019s actions. As such, despite their epistemic worth in\nordinary contexts, imaginings might not help in making life-altering\ndecisions.\n",
