Here\nwe will consider a selection of the main objections along with\nresponses put forward by reflective equilibrium\u2019s defenders.\n3.1 Initial Credibility\n\nCritics have queried the epistemic value of the considered judgments\nor \u201cintuitions\u201d that underpin reflective equilibrium\n(Williamson 2022: 246\u2013248). While reflective equilibrium may\ndeliver a coherent set of beliefs, the objection is that there are no\ngrounds for supposing that this set is credible:\n\n\nIn the case of normative beliefs, no reason has been offered why we\nshould think that initial credence levels, for a person, correspond to\ncredibilities. (Brandt 1979: 20)\n\n\nThe outcome of reflective equilibrium may be believed, but that is\nconsistent with it being coherent fiction. Indeed, some considered\njudgments seem plainly unreasonable. The judgment that killing at\nrandom is morally required would have to be accepted as a considered\njudgment on the standard account of reflective equilibrium that\nrejects an epistemic constraint on considered judgments (Kelly &\nMcGrath 2010).\n\nThis objection arguably foregrounds considered judgments to the extent\nof neglecting the justificatory heart of the method, which is its\nprocess. This\n\n\ninvolves identifying our considered judgments, learning more about\nthem, and perhaps modifying them in the process of considering\nprinciples that would account for them. (Scanlon 2014: 84)\n\n\nIndeed, the objection seems directed more at narrow reflective\nequilibrium, where the reflective process has little effect on the\noutcome. Consider the coherentist interpretation of reflective\nequilibrium discussed above, which highlights that judgments and\nprinciples in equilibrium cohere with the deliberator\u2019s entire\nsystem of thought, which has arisen from reflection on all relevant\nprinciples and argument. It is hard to claim that this is not at least\nsomething in favour of their position. Someone who has not followed\nthe method, and whose judgments and principles are only partially\nformed, extend only to a few cases, are flagrantly contradictory in\nsome of those cases, and result from consideration of a limited range\nof principles and argument, does not, at least typically, have a view\nthat is as credible.\n\nIt is true that there is little about wide reflective equilibrium that\nwould prevent implausible considered judgments from entering the\nprocess, but this is because it is supposed that this filtering is\nproperly conducted with all relevant theory on the table. Filtering in\nadvance would require epistemic and (given the above examples) moral\ncriteria that could well conflict with the theories accepted in wide\nreflective equilibrium.\n\nTo be sure, it is possible that some of those who claim to follow the\nmethod start with such unreasonable views (e.g., a cast iron\ncommitment to random killing) that they will still have unreasonable\nviews in equilibrium, but this could be seen as analogous to a\nscientist having such unreasonable views (e.g., a cast iron commitment\nto creationism or climate change denial) that their findings are\nunreasonable despite apparently following scientific procedure (Knight\n2017: 53\u201354). It might be held that, for people starting with\nsuch radically different beliefs from our own, it is not unreasonable\nto reach seemingly perverse equilibria (Cath 2016: 225\u2013226).\nAlternatively, and as explored below, the method might allow that\ntheir views are unjustified even though they are in equilibrium.\n3.2 Relativism\n\nSeveral critics object that there is no unique reflective\nequilibrium. There are two objections here, one interpersonal, one\nintrapersonal. The interpersonal objection is considered first.\n\nSome advocates of reflective equilibrium combine the view with moral\nrealism, maintaining that the method can provide evidence of objective\nmoral truth (Brink 1989 and more tentatively Daniels 1996:\n37\u201339). Rawls takes a less metaethically ambitious approach, his\nconstructivist theory providing \u201cobjectivity for its limited\npolitical purposes\u201d (Rawls 2005: 110; see also Nielsen 1993;\nBrandstedt & Br\u00e4nnmark 2020). On either view reflective\nequilibrium can offer objective support for moral principles.\n\nCritics disagree, claiming that reflective equilibrium falls victim to\nrelativism. The objection starts with the observation that\ndifferent people following the method may reach different, conflicting\nequilibria (Dworkin 1973 [1975: 34\u201336]; de Maagt 2017:\n450\u2013451). How can it be the case that each of two or more\nconflicting views are objectively justified? The justification rather\nlooks to be relative to the deliberator.\n\nBut reflective equilibrium is properly understood as a\npotential source of justification. There is no need to claim\nthat it always offers evidence of moral truth or practical guidance.\nHence, the mere existence of conflicting equilibria does not mark the\ndescent into relativism. As Scanlon notes,\n\n\naccepting that some person is well informed and has carried out the\nsearch for reflective equilibrium conscientiously does not even commit\none to the conclusion that this person is justified in accepting the\nprinciples that result, let alone the conclusion that those principles\nare justified. (Scanlon 2003: 152)\n\n\nHe asks us to enquire as to the reasons for divergences between our\nequilibrium and that of another. Did we start with different\nconsidered judgments? Did the divergence arise due to later\nadjustments in considered judgments? Is it due to consideration of\ndifferent moral principles? At each stage we are to ask whether we\nfeel we made the better decisions or whether we might now revise our\njudgments and principles (Scanlon 2003: 152\u2013153; Scanlon 2014:\n79\u201381).\n\nWhat if we are content with the decisions leading to both\nequilibria? Two conflicting views being equally justified is not\nreally suggestive of relativism, but rather supports a pluralistic\nposition (Scanlon 2014: 79). It seems no less objective to judge that\ntwo equilibria are equally justified than it is to judge that one is\nmore justified than the other.\n3.3 Indeterminacy\n\nOn, then, to the objection to the lack of a unique\nintrapersonal equilibrium. Just as different people may reach\ndifferent equilibria, the same person may reach different equilibria\nat different times, as their judgments are revisable. The ethical\ndeliberator can simply change their mind even if the relevant facts\nstay the same, the claimed standard of justification being a drifting\none (Copp 1985: 165). Alternatively, there may be multiple\nsimultaneous equilibria even for a single person, where principles and\njudgments can be made to fit each other in different combinations\n(Haslett 1987: 310). Critics worry that such an indeterminate\nprocedure cannot tell us what to believe or results in an arbitrary\noutcome (McPherson 2015: 662\u2013663; List & Valentini 2016:\n542).\n\nThis line of objection is largely anticipated by Rawls, who\nacknowledges that there may be no unique equilibrium even for one\nperson, and that the judgments we start with, or the \u201ccourse of\nreflection itself,\u201d may affect the principles we settle on\n(Rawls 1971: 50). He simply sets such questions aside, saying that\nreflective equilibrium \u201cis, if you wish, a kind of psychology\nand does not presuppose the existence of objective moral truths\u201d\n(Rawls 1974: 9). For reasons parallel to those in the interpersonal\ncase, it may also be that the truth of moral realism, and the\nexistence of objective moral facts, are compatible with drifting\nequilibria (Knight 2006: 220). Advocates of reflective equilibrium do\nnot claim that it gives direct access to or perfectly tracks moral\ntruth, only that it can justify moral beliefs. Even where the ultimate\nfacts are static, a belief can become more justified by becoming\nendorsed by the deliberators\u2019 judgments and cohering with their\nreflectively-derived system of beliefs.\n3.4 Bias\n\nThe further objection might then be raised that reflective equilibrium\nis vulnerable to arbitrary order or framing biases (McPherson 2015:\n662\u2013663; List & Valentini 2016: 542). One study found that\nprofessional philosophers were vulnerable to order and framing\neffects, and that this was not reduced by reflection or expertise on\nthe topics in question (Schwitzgebel & Cushman 2015). The\njudgments of participants in reflective equilibrium might be\nconsidered unreliable in the sense that they vary with factors that\nthey themselves consider irrelevant (Paulo 2020: 335\u2013336).\n\nAdditional biases are suggested by experiments bringing out the\nemotional nature of moral reasoning. They show, for instance, that\nthere is greater activation of brain areas associated with emotional\nprocessing in personal cases, such as the variant of the trolley\nproblem where a large person is pushed from a footbridge, than in\notherwise similar impersonal cases, such as the original trolley\nproblem (Greene et al. 2001). Peter Singer suggests that considered\njudgments in such cases are emotionally-driven evolved responses to\ncircumstances that no longer obtain:\n\n\nthe salient feature that explains our different intuitive judgments\nconcerning the two cases is that the footbridge case is the kind of\nsituation that was likely to arise during the eons of time over which\nwe were evolving; whereas the standard trolley case describes a way of\nbringing about someone\u2019s death that has only been possible in\nthe past century or two, a time far too short to have any impact on\nour inherited patterns of emotional response. But what is the moral\nsalience of the fact that I have killed someone in a way that was\npossible a million years ago, rather than in a way that became\npossible only two hundred years ago? I would answer: none. (Singer\n2005: 348)\n\n\nHe therefore concludes that reflective equilibrium is mistaken in\ngiving considered judgments a central role in moral theorizing. Other\ncritics similarly suggest that considered judgments may be based on\nprejudice (Brandt 1979: 22; Hare 1981: 12; Anderson 2015).\n\nWide reflective equilibrium may be able to take on board these\nconcerns, and revise judgments accordingly. For instance, if we are\nmoved by Singer\u2019s argument about the strongly emotional and\nevolutionary character of some of our moral judgments, we could use a\nrevised conception of considered judgments that excludes judgments\ndistorted in this way (Tersman 2008: 398). Alternatively, we could\nallow such judgments to enter the process, but revise them given the\nbackground theory that Singer introduces (see Tersman 2008: 397).\nOrder or framing effects would similarly be highlighted by\npsychological background theories, allowing the deliberator to take\ncompensatory measures.\n3.5 An Empty Method?\n\nBy this point the critic may be exasperated. If you identify a problem\nwith someone\u2019s way of doing philosophy, and they agree that\nit\u2019s a problem, you might expect them to change how they do it.\nBut the adherent of wide reflective equilibrium accepts the criticism\nbut maintains their method, saying that they have adopted the\ncriticism within the method. To critics this suggests that the method\nis \u201cclose to vacuous\u201d (Singer 2005: 349), absorbing\nmethodological controversies rather than adjudicating them (McPherson\n2015: 661; Paulo 2020: 346; de Maagt 2017: 458). It just takes us\n\n\nback to the usual philosophical argument about the merits and demerits\nof various methods of argument and of various theories. The method of\nreflective equilibrium is then not a method in moral philosophy at\nall. (Raz 1982: 309)\n\n\nDefenders of wide reflective equilibrium describe it in similar terms\nto the critics, while rejecting their negative evaluation. Its ability\nto absorb apparent rivals is seen as a feature, not a bug:\n\n\nThis charge of emptiness seems to me to be largely correct, but\nnonetheless mistaken in one important respect, and therefore not as\ndamaging as it sounds. The charge is largely correct because the\nsearch for wide reflective equilibrium, as Rawls describes it, allows\nfor what might have been seen as alternative methods of justification\nto be incorporated within it. \u2026 What the method of reflective\nequilibrium prescribes is, so to speak, a level playing field of\nintuitive justification on which principles and judgments of all\nlevels of generality must compete for our allegiance. It thus allows\nall possible sources of justificatory force to be considered. But the\nmethod is not vacuous because it is incompatible with some views about\nthese sources. It is incompatible, first, with the idea that any\nparticular class of judgments or principles can be singled out in\nadvance of this process as justified on some other basis and, second,\nwith the idea that any class of considered judgments should be left\nout of this process. (Scanlon 2003: 151).\n\n\nIt might be added that critics of reflective equilibrium are rich\nsources of methods incompatible with reflective equilibrium. For\ninstance, Brandt\u2019s cognitive psychotherapy, Hare\u2019s\nuniversal prescriptivism, Anderson\u2019s pragmatism, or de\nMaagt\u2019s transcendentalism describe methods for justifying moral\nviews prior to, or without, reflective equilibrium (Brandt 1979; Hare\n1981; Anderson 2015; de Maagt 2017). Reflective equilibrium rules\nout\n\n\nmoral skepticism and nihilism and other doctrines that doubt our\ncapacities for morality altogether, as well as naturalism and other\nreductionist efforts to justify moral principles purely on the basis\nof factual, linguistic, or metaphysical claims. (Freeman 2007: 37; see\nalso Rawls 1971: 51)\n\n\nGiven the many methods and theories at odds with reflective\nequilibrium, it is hard to maintain that it is devoid of content, or\nnearly so. If it looks that way it may be because its assumptions are\nwidely accepted in moral and political philosophy, a victim of its own\nsuccess.",
