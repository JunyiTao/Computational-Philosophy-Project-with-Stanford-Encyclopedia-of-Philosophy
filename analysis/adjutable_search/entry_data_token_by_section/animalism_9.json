    "main_text": "Arguments for and Objections to Animalism || Replies to the Thinking Animal Argument\n3.2 Replies to the Thinking Animal Argument\n\nNot all replies to the thinking animal argument have focused\nexclusively on, or even addressed themselves directly, to one or the\nother of the three premises that make up that argument. Nevertheless,\nmany replies to animalism do concern questions raised by the thinking\nanimal argument and may fruitfully be seen as addressing one or\nanother of its premises.\n\nFor instance, according to Baker\u2019s (2000, 2007) constitution\nview, (P3) should be rejected, since \u201cthinking being sitting in\nyour chair\u201d is ambiguous as between the constituted person who\nthinks nonderivatively and the constituting human animal who thinks\nderivatively\n (section 2.3).\n And Noonan (1998, 2001) also detects an ambiguity in (P2) and (P3).\nAccording to his revisionist view of personal pronoun use,\nfirst-person thoughts and utterances refer only to persons, not to\nanimals. On his view, we must distinguish between the referent of\nfirst-person thoughts and utterances, on the one hand, and the thinker\nof those thoughts and utterances, on the other hand. Noonan does not\ndeny that the human animal sitting in your chair is capable of\nfirst-personal thinking. Nor does he deny that such thoughts (and the\nutterances that express them) successfully refer. But he does insist\nthat, when the animal has a first-person thought or utters\n\u2018I\u2019, that thought or utterance refers not to the animal\nwho thinks the thought but to the person with whom the animal shares\nits thoughts. (For further discussion, see Noonan 2012 and Olson\n2002a, 2007: 37\u201339.)\n\nAnd, although not initially developed as a response to the thinking\nanimal argument, S. Shoemaker\u2019s (1984, 1999, 2004) view\nrepresents a direct and formidable challenge to (P2). On his account,\nthe human animal sitting in your chair is not thinking because no\nanimal is capable of thinking. This in turn is because the capacity\nfor thought requires persistence conditions that all animals, human or\notherwise, lack: \u201cmental properties\u201d, Shoemaker writes,\n\u201ccan belong only to things having psychological persistence\nconditions\u201d (2004: 528). A thinker\u2019s psychological states\nplay characteristic causal roles, and these states (in combination\nwith others) tend to cause the thinking being whose states they are to\nbehave in certain ways. Thus, for example, the state of being in pain\nmay be caused by bodily damage of some kind and may dispose the one\nwho is in pain to cry out or recoil.\n\nThe linchpin of Shoemaker\u2019s view is his claim that the causal\nrole of any psychological state as well as any other states involved\nin that causal role must all be states of one and the same thinking\nbeing (1999: 300). In other words, the effects typically brought about\nby a being\u2019s psychological states cannot fail to occur in that\nvery being. Olson summarizes the consequence of this commitment as\nfollows:\n\n\nif your cerebrum gets put into my head tomorrow, your current mental\nstates will have their characteristic effects in the being who ends up\nwith that organ, and not in the empty-headed thing left behind. By\nShoemaker\u2019s reasoning, the subject of those\nstates\u2014you\u2014must therefore be the being who ends up with\nyour transplanted cerebrum. Any being whose later states or actions\nare caused in the appropriate way by your current mental states must\nbe you. In other words, psychological continuity of a sort must\nsuffice for you or any other mental being to persist through time.\nSince no sort of psychological continuity suffices for any organism to\npersist \u2026 it follows that no organism could have mental\nproperties. The nature of mental properties makes it metaphysically\nimpossible for animals to think. (Olson 2007: 33\u201334.)\n\n\nShoemaker\u2019s functionalist theory of mind has received\nconsiderable attention in the philosophy of mind. His view that\nanimals cannot think and the implications of that claim for the\nthinking animal argument are discussed in \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir\n2010, Hershenov 2006, Olson 2002b, and S. Shoemaker 2004, 2008, 2011,\n2016.\n\nBeyond these discussions of (P2) and (P3), much of the recent\ndiscussion concerning animalism has focused on such questions as\nwhether one or more than one thinker is sitting in your chair; if more\nthan one, which one is doing the thinking; and in what sense.\nZimmerman (2008), for instance, objects to (P1) by noting that the\nrationale for the claim that a human animal is located where you\nare\u2014in effect, that it is just obvious that there is an instance\nof the species Homo sapiens currently located where you\nare\u2014extends equally to such things as \u201cmere hunk of\nmatter\u201d, \u201cmere body\u201d, \u201cpsychological\nperson\u201d, and the like. Since the animalist does not accept that\nwe are identical to any of these non-animals, the evident truth of\n(P1) will not be sufficient to establish the thinking animal\nargument\u2019s conclusion. What is required, in other words, is not\nsimply a reason for believing that (P1) is true\u2014animalists, let\nus assume, are correct in insisting that few would deny it\u2014but\nalso a reason for denying the presence of other things besides a human\nanimal. This is the \u201crival candidates problem\u201d.\n\nClosely related to this problem is another. The \u201cthinking parts\nproblem\u201d charges that, even if you are a thinking being, no\nreason has been given to suppose that you are a thinking\nanimal rather than any of the other thinking beings currently\nlocated where you are. To begin, consider all the parts of a human\nanimal that are plausibly regarded as thinking: the head, the brain,\nthe right-leg complement (i.e., the entire animal body minus the right\nleg), the entire animal from the waist up (torso, neck, and head), the\nleft-arm complement minus a single electron in the animal\u2019s\nliver, the left-arm complement minus a different electron in the\nanimal\u2019s liver, etc. For each of these thinking parts, an\nargument structurally analogous to the thinking animal argument could\nbe constructed. For instance:\n\n(P1\u2032)There is a\nhuman head currently located where you are.\n(P2\u2032)The human\nhead currently located where you are is thinking.\n(P3\u2032)You are the\nthinking being located in your chair.\n(C\u2032)Therefore,\nthe human head located where you are is you.\n\n\nLikewise:\n\n(P1\u2033)There is a\ntorso-neck-and-head currently located where you are.\n(P2\u2033)The\ntorso-neck-and-head currently located where you are is\nthinking.\n(P3\u2032)You are the\nthinking being located in your chair.\n(C\u2033)Therefore,\nthe torso-neck-and-head located where you are is you.\n\n\nAnd so on. If the thinking animal argument were sound, then it would\nfollow (per impossibile) that you are identical with each of\nan infinite number of nonidentical thinking parts. Since you could be\nidentical with no more than one of those things, and since the\nanimalist has provided no principled explanation for why you are the\nwhole animal and not one or another of the animal\u2019s thinking\nparts, the thinking animal argument should be rejected.\n\nMuch of the discussion about animalism has been concerned with the\nrival candidates and thinking parts problems. (See, for instance,\nBlatti 2016; Lowe 2001; Madden 2016a; Olson 2007: 215\u201319 and\n2015; Parfit 2012; Yang 2015.) One line of response draws on van\nInwagen\u2019s (1990) view of composite material beings. According to\nvan Inwagen\u2019s answer to what he calls the \u201cspecial\ncomposition question\u201d, the only composite objects that exist are\nliving organisms. Only a living organism unifies the particles that\ncompose it at any given moment, on this view. Such things as\n\u201cmere hunk of matter\u201d and \u201cright-leg\ncomplement\u201d are gerrymandered objects. And since they are not\ngenuine composite objects, they are neither genuine rivals nor genuine\nthinkers. Olson (2008: 38\u201342) is, however, quick to acknowledge\nthat this riposte will be welcomed only by those antecedently\npersuaded of van Inwagen\u2019s view. And proponents of the rival\ncandidates and thinking parts problems are particularly unlikely to\ncount among van Inwagen\u2019s supporters.\n",
