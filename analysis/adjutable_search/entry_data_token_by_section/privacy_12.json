A general\ndiscussion of privacy, not focused on one particular aspect but\nrather presenting the different threats to privacy, and its role and\nassociated tensions in discussions of advancing technology, can be\nfound in different recent comprehensive monographs, for instance in\nRule (2007), also in Rotenberg, Scott, and Horwitz (2015), in Citron\n(2022) as well as in Francis and Francis (2017); Focusing on more\nparticular aspects of the normative debates, Koops et al. (2017) have\ngiven a very helpful and informative overview over the different\npossibilities of defining the meaning and value of privacy. They aim\nat a typology of eight concepts of privacy:\n\n\nOur analysis led us to structure types of privacy in a two-dimensional\nmode, consisting of eight basic types of privacy (bodily,\nintellectual, spatial, decisional, communicational, associational,\nproprietary, and behavioral privacy), with an overlay of a ninth type\n(informational privacy) that overlaps, but does not coincide, with the\neight basic types. (2017: 483)\n\n\nThey also very helpfully explain the differences between access-based,\ncontrol-based and other approaches to the function and value of\nprivacy. Marmor (2015) argues that in the past it has been\nincreasingly difficult to argue for a general interest which privacy\nis to protect, especially because of the reductionist critique of\nThomson (1975); see\n \u00a72.1).\n Marmor goes on to claim, however,\n\n\nthat there is a general right to privacy grounded in people\u2019s\ninterest in having a reasonable measure of control over the ways in\nwhich they can present themselves (and what is theirs) to others.\n(2015: 3\u20134)\n\n\nMarmor presents an interesting version of a control-based theory of\nprivacy in defending the view that we have a basic interest in having\n(reasonable) control over evaluations of ourselves, which also means\nthat we have an interest in a predictable environment and a\npredictable flow of information (see 2015: 25). He is thereby in fact\nconnecting to other control-based approaches (see Jean Cohen 1992,\nalso Goffman 1959) as well as theories of privacy as contextual\nintegrity (see Nissenbaum 2010). Mainz and Uhrenfeldt (2021) also\nsupport the control-access approach to privacy, claiming that\n\n\nthere is at least a pro tanto reason to favor the control account of\nthe right to privacy over the access account of the right to privacy.\n(2021: 287)\n\n\nIn a slightly different manner, Gaukroger (2020: 416) claims that\nprivacy not only protects us when we act in morally right ways, but\nalso when we make use of the \u201cfreedom to be\nbad\u201d\u2014which he defends as a general good. Lundgren,\nhowever, disputes the control-access approach because of its\nfundamental difficulties. Following Parent, Lundgren argues that if we\nadopt a control based account, we lose privacy every time we give\nsomeone access to whatever it is we want to keep private which in fact\nmeans that we lose more and more of our privacy. Lundgren therefore\nargues for a \u201climited access\u201d (Lundgren 2020: 173)\nconception, criticizing many different forms of control-access\naccounts (2020: 167 fn 7). (By implicitly following Bloustein\u2019s\n(1964) plea for the centrality of the concept of human dignity,\nFloridi (2016) contends that the concept of dignity should be the\nfoundation of interpreting informational privacy, as understood by the\nGDPR.)\n\nA further development concerns the theory of contextual\nintegrity, as developed by Helen Nissenbaum. Nissenbaum\u2019s\nframework of Contextual Integrity has won enormous attention as the\nstandard to evaluate flows of personal information, their legitimacy\nand acceptability but has not remained undisputed. On the one hand,\nNissenbaum\u2019s paradigm has led to a great number of articles\napplying it to different societal fields and technology developments.\nShvartzshnaider et al. (2019) present \u201ca method for analyzing\nprivacy policies using the framework of contextual integrity\n(CI)\u201d. The authors claim that this\n\n\nmethod allows for the systematized detection of issues with privacy\npolicy statements that hinder readers\u2019 ability to understand and\nevaluate company data collection practices. (Shvartzshnaider et al.\n2019: 162)\n\n\nNissenbaum (2019) herself applies the approach of contextual integrity\nto a complex data network and argues that especially the contextual\nintegrity approach is able to identify those sources of disruption in\nnovel information practices which should be criticized (2019: 221; see\nalso Nissenbaum 2015). Another interesting example is Shaffer (2021)\nwho applies the Contextual Integrity Framework to new technologies for\nsmart cities. Winter and Davidson (2019) apply the approach of\ncontextual integrity to the problem of data governance in health\ninformation, since advances in collecting data\n\n\nalso pose significant data governance challenges for ensuring value\nfor individual, organizational, and societal stakeholders as well as\nindividual privacy and autonomy.\n\n\nThey go on to\n\n\ninvestigate how forms of data governance were adapted, as PHI\n[Personal Health Information] data flowed into new use contexts, to\naddress concerns of contextual integrity, which is violated when\npersonal information collected in one use context moves to another use\ncontext with different norms of appropriateness. (2019: 36)\n\n\nOn the other hand, some criticism has been raised which argues that\nNissenbaum does not actually provide normative standards to judge\nwhich information flows should be seen as ethically justified and\nwhich as detrimental (Rule 2019). Rule argues that\n\n\nnotions that norms underlying any given domain of human conduct are\nunambiguous or uncontested simply do not withstand close examination.\nIndeed, most social norms, particularly in rapidly changing domains of\nhuman conduct like privacy practices, are volatile and highly\ncontested. (2019: 260)\n\n\nIn a similar vein, DeCew (2015) questions the idea that in any given\ncontext, the governing norms might be not up to ethical standards and\nstill defendable on the basis of the integrity of the context and the\nnorms governing it, as is the case of the governing norms in the\ntraditional family (DeCew 2015: 215).\n\nFinally, the theory that private data should be seen as private\nproperty should be mentioned. This idea originated with\nLessig (2002) and has since been discussed by a number of authors.\nArguments exist for and against the idea that the agents generating\ndatapoints\u2014the source of the data\u2014have a right to claim\nthose datapoints as private property (Schneider 2021; see also Tufekci\n2015; Wu 2015).\n",
