Why, for example, should we suppose that there must be\nsomething deficient about a creature that does not enjoy\u2014or that\nis not able to enjoy\u2014strawberries and cream? True enough, we\nmight suppose that an intelligent creature ought to have the capacity\nto enjoy some kinds of things\u2014but it seems unduly chauvinistic\nto insist that intelligent creatures must be able to enjoy just the\nkinds of things that we do. (No doubt, similar considerations apply to\nthe claim that an intelligent creature must be the kind of thing that\ncan make a human being fall in love with it. Yes, perhaps, an\nintelligent creature should be the kind of thing that can love and be\nloved; but what is so special about us?)\n\nSetting aside those tasks that we deem to be unduly chauvinistic, we\nshould then ask what grounds there are for supposing that no digital\ncomputing machine could do the other things on the list.\nTuring suggests that the most likely ground lies in our prior\nacquaintance with machines of all kinds: none of the machines that any\nof us has hitherto encountered has been able to do these things. In\nparticular, the digital computers with which we are now familiar\ncannot do these things. (Except perhaps for make mistakes: after all,\neven digital computers are subject to \u201cerrors of\nfunctioning.\u201d But this might be set aside as an irrelevant\ncase.) However, given the limitations of storage capacity and\nprocessing speed of even the most recent digital computers, there are\nobvious reasons for being cautious in assessing the merits of this\ninductive argument.\n\n(A different question worth asking concerns the progress that has been\nmade until now in constructing machines that can do the kinds of\nthings that appear on Turing\u2019s list. There is at least room for\ndebate about the extent to which current computers can: make mistakes,\nuse words properly, learn from experience, be beautiful, etc.\nMoreover, there is also room for debate about the extent to which\nrecent advances in other areas may be expected to lead to further\nadvancements in overcoming these alleged disabilities. Perhaps, for\nexample, recent advances in work on artificial sensors may one day\ncontribute to the production of machines that can enjoy strawberries\nand cream. Of course, if the intended objection is to the notion that\nmachines can experience any kind of feeling of enjoyment, then it is\nnot clear that work on particular kinds of artificial sensors is to\nthe point.)\n",
