    "main_text": "History || Phenomenology\n2.2 Phenomenology\n\nSubstantive and concise philosophical analyses of collective\nintentionality can be found in early Phenomenology and Existential\nPhilosophy. These contributions have attracted increasing attention in\nrecent years (Salice & Schmid 2016; Moran & Szanto 2016).\nAmong the many relevant contributions and contributors (including\nEdmund Husserl, Edith Stein, and Jean-Paul Sartre), two stand out as\nparticularly important: Gerda Walther (1923), and Max Scheler (1954\n[1912]). The paradigm case in their (implicit) controversy is shared\nexperience.\n\nWalther claims that for A and B to share the experience\nof x, i) A has to experience x, and B has\nto experience x, ii) A has to empathize with\nB\u2019s experience and vice versa, iii) A has to\nidentify with B\u2019s experience and vice versa, and iv)\nthere has to be mutual empathetic awareness of the other\u2019s\nidentification (Walther 1923: 85f.). Walther offers substantive\nanalyses of empathetic experience and identification, but the question\nremains why the reciprocal intentional attitudes required from the\nparticipants in shared experience stops at level three (current\naccounts that follow similar lines usually require full common\nknowledge). How could there be a shared experience between A\nand B if A is unaware of the fact that B\nis empathetically aware of A\u2019s identification with\nB\u2019s experience, or some such? It seems easy to develop a\nscenario in which Walther\u2019s conditions are met, but in which\nthere is no shared experience for lack of awareness of what the other\ntakes to be the case. If collective intentionality is analyzed in\nterms of a combination of individual intentionality and mutual\nrecognition of some sorts, it seems that an infinite progress of\nreciprocal attitudes is set off.\n\nScheler\u2019s most important contribution to the analysis of\ncollective intentionality is largely negative. Joint intentionality is\nnot, Scheler holds, a combination of individual intentionality with a\nstructure of reciprocal awareness, whatever the structure and kind of\nthe reciprocal awareness in question may be. From his analysis emerges\nthe view that when people share an attitude, it is not the case that\neach participant has an attitude of his or her own, but that the\nintentional attitude at stake here is really one and the same, so that\nmany minds are in a numerically identical state. The most\nconspicuous examples Scheler discusses are the experience of grief\nwhich parents, without thinking of each other, share at the deathbed\nof their child (Scheler 1954 [1912]: 145), and the chillingly positive\naccount of the shared national enthusiasm (the August Madness) at the\noutbreak of World War One (Scheler 1982 [1914]: 272ff.). Without\nmentioning his source, Martin Heidegger follows roughly Schelerian\nlines in his discussion of more innocent examples in (1996 [1928/29]).\nThe idea is that collective intentionality is not a combination of\nindividual intentionality and reciprocal attitudes, but irreducibly\ncollective (for a recent re-statement of this point see Searle 1995:\n27). A problem of irreducibility-claims of this sort, however, is that\nit is hard to believe that the participants in a collective\nintentional attitude do not represent, in some way, each other, even\nif they need not have occurrent beliefs or conscious empathetic\nexperience. A participant\u2019s intention represents the others as\nco-intenders in some way, or so it seems (Searle seems to concede this\npoint in Searle 2010: 15). An important question to consider is\nwhether the relation between the co-intenders is of the cognitive,\nnormative, or rather of the affective kind. Tuomela & Miller\n(1988) and Michael Bratman (1999) argue that the participants have to\nknow what the others are up to, Alonso (2009) argues that\nthey just have to rely on them, while Gilbert (1990) claims\nthat they have to normatively expect others to do their\nparts. Schmid (2013) argues that the attitude in question is\ntrust, and that this combines cognitive and normative\ncomponents. The question of how participants in collective\nintentionality \u201crepresent\u201d each other becomes particularly\npressing if it is assumed that basic cases of shared intentionality\nare developed at an age where infants do not have a theory of mind,\nsuch as in Michael Tomasello\u2019s (2009) view.\n",
