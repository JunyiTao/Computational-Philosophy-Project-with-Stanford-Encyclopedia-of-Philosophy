Branching Time Semantics\n\nSince Prior\u2019s time, it has become a standard to study\ntense-logical systems in terms of semantical models based on the idea\nof branching time. This idea was not realised in Prior\u2019s early\nworks on temporal logic. Indeed it had not yet been formulated in his\nTime and Modality (1957), which otherwise marked the major\nbreakthrough of the new logic of time. As an explicit (or formalised)\nidea, branching time was first suggested to Prior in a letter from\nSaul Kripke in September 1958. This letter contains an initial version\nof the idea and a system of branching time, although it was not worked\nout in details. Kripke, who was then only 17 years old, suggested that\nwe may consider the present as a point of Rank 1, and possible events\nor states at the next moment as points of Rank 2; for every such\npossible state in turn, there would be various possible future states\nat the next moment from Rank 3, the set of which could be labelled\nRank 4, and so forth. Kripke wrote:\n\n\nNow in an indetermined system, we perhaps should not regard time as a\nlinear series, as you have done. Given the present moment, there are\nseveral possibilities for what the next moment may be like \u2013 and\nfor each possible next moment, there are several possibilities for the\nnext moment after that. Thus the situation takes the form, not of a\nlinear sequence, but of a \u201ctree\u201d\u2026 [Letter from Saul\nKripke to A.N. Prior, dated September 3, 1958, kept in the Prior\nCollection at Bodleian Library, Oxford, Box 4. See also Ploug et al.\n2012.]\n\n\nIn this way it is possible to form a tree structure representing the\nentire set of possible futures expanding from the present (Rank 1)\n\u2013 indeed a set of possible futures can be said to be identified\nfor any state, or node in the tree. In this structure every point\ndetermines a subtree consisting of its own present and possible\nfutures. Kripke illustrated this idea in the following way:\n\n\n\n\nIn the letter Kripke wrote:\n\nThe point 0 (or origin) is the present, and the points 1, 2, and 3 (of\nrank 2) are the possibilities for the next moment. If the point 1\nactually does come to pass, 4, 5, and 6 are its possible successors,\nand so on. The whole tree then represents the entire set of\npossibilities for present and future; and every point determines a\nsubtree consisting of its own present and future.\n\n\nIn Prior\u2019s opinion the notion of branching time is certainly not\nunproblematic. After all it is a representation of time in terms of\nspace. The notion seems to involve the idea that the \u201cNow\u201d\nis moving through the system. Several authors have argued that the\npicture of a moving point within the branching time system is rather\nproblematic. In fact, this problem of the \u201cNow\u201d as a\nmoving point goes back to Jack Smart (1949). Later it has been debated\nby Storrs McCall (1976, p. 348, 1995) and Graham Nerlich (1995).\nRecently MacFarlane has pointed out that there is nothing such a\nmotion could represent, since we have already represented time as one\nof the spatial dimensions of the tree (MacFarlane 2008, p. 86).\n\nIt seems that Prior right from the beginning was aware of the basic\nconceptual problems involved in the notion of branching time. However,\nhe certainly found this notion useful as long as it is applied\ncarefully. During the 1960s he substantially developed the idea. He\nworked out the formal details of several different systems, which\nconstitute different and even competing interpretations of the idea of\nbranching time, as we shall see below.\n\nA tense-logical model (TIME,\\(\\le\\),C,\\(\\TRUE\\)) based on a branching\ntime system is a structure, where (TIME,\\(\\le)\\) is a partially\nordered set of moments of time, and C is a set of so-called histories\nor chronicles i.e., maximally ordered linear subsets in\n(TIME,\\(\\le)\\). It is standard procedure how to define \u201c=\u201d\nand \u201c\\(\\lt\\)\u201d in terms of \u201c\\(\\le\\)\u201d. The\nbefore/after relation, \\(\\lt\\), is supposed to be irreflexive,\nasymmetric, transitive and backwards linear. Backwards linearity means\n\u201cno backwards branching\u201d i.e. \n\n\\[\n(t_1 \\lt t_0 \\wedge t_2 \\lt t_0) \\supset (t_1 \\lt t_2 \\vee t_2 \\lt t_1 \\vee t_2 = t_1)\n\\]\n\n\nfor all moments of time \\(t_0, t_1\\), and \\(t_2\\). This means that the\npast relative to \\(t_0\\), PAST\\((t_0)\\), i.e., the set \\(\\{t \\mid t\n\\lt t_0\\}\\), is linear. In consequence, PAST\\((t_0)\\) will be a subset\nof any chronicle through \\(t_0\\). Much more on the mathematics of\npartially ordered sets and their use in temporal logic can be found in\n(van Benthem 1991, in particular in Part I). \n\nIn addition, historical connectedness may be considered as an axiom,\ni.e., it may be assumed that \\(c_1 \\cap c_2 \\ne \\varnothing,\\) for any\ntwo chronicles \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) in the branching time system.\n\nIn many branching time models C will just be the set of all maximally\nordered linear subsets in (TIME,\\(\\le)\\). In such cases C will not be\nan independent parameter of the model. In other cases, however, there\nwill be some additional restrictions on C, i.e., it will be a proper\nsubset of the set of all maximally ordered linear subsets in\n(TIME,\\(\\le)\\). In some branching time models there will also be\nintroduced a relation of (counterfactually) co-temporaneous moments.\nGiven that such a relation is an equivalence relation, it may give\nrise to the definition of instants as equivalence classes of\nco-temporaneous moments.\n\nFor any propositional constant, \\(p\\), and any moment in TIME, \\(t\\),\nthere is a truth-value, \\(\\TRUE(p,t)\\). This means that the\ntruth-value of a propositional constant does not vary with the\nchronicles. The truth-value of a propositional constant depends only\non the moment. On this basis the truth-value of any well formed\nformula (wff) has to be defined recursively. In the following sections\nwe shall see that this can be done in several different ways.\n\nIt may, however, be objected that it is problematic to operate with\ntwo different kinds of propositions: 1) propositional constants with\ntruth-values that do not vary with the chronicles and 2) other wffs\nwith truth-values that may vary with the chronicles. Thomason (1970,\np. 280) has pointed out that this distinction means that substitution\nof propositions in the system will have to be restricted, since we\nwill not be allowed to substitute a propositional constant with an\narbitrary wff. Prior was aware of this, but he argued that it is in\nfact possible to handle a system with restrictions on the\nsubstitution-rules. (See Prior 1967, p. 122 ff.)\n",
