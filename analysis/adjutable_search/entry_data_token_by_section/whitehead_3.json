    "main_text": "Philosophy of Science\n4. Philosophy of Science\n\nWhitehead\u2019s reconstruction of the space-time of the STR and his\nATG make clear (i) that his main methodological requirement in the\nphilosophy of science is that physical theories should cohere with our\nintuitions of the relatedness of nature (of the relations of\nextension, congruence, cogredience, causality, etc.), and (ii) that\nhis paradigm of what a theory of physics should be like is the\nMaxwell-Lorentz theory of electrodynamics. And indeed, in his\nphilosophy of science, Whitehead rejects David Hume\u2019s\n\u201csensationalist empiricism\u201d (1929c [1985: 57]) and Isaac\nNewton\u2019s \u201cscientific materialism\u201d (1925 [1967:\n17]). Instead Whitehead promotes (i) a radical empiricist methodology,\nwhich relies on our perception, not only of sense data (colors,\nsounds, smells, etc.) but also of a manifold of natural relations, and\n(ii) an electrodynamics-like worldview, in which the fundamental\nconcepts are no longer simply located substances or bits of matter,\nbut internally related processes and events.\n\n\u201cModern physical science\u201d, Whitehead wrote,\n\n\nis the issue of a coordinated effort, sustained for more than three\ncenturies, to understand those activities of Nature by reason of which\nthe transitions of sense-perception occur. (1934 [2011: 65])\n\n\nBut according to Whitehead, Hume\u2019s sensationalist empiricism has\nundermined the idea that our perception can reveal those activities,\nand Newton\u2019s scientific materialism has failed to render his\nformulae of motion and gravitation intelligible.\n\nWhitehead was dissatisfied with Hume\u2019s reduction of perception\nto sense perception because, as Hume discovered, pure sense perception\nreveals a succession of spatial patterns of impressions of color,\nsound, smell, etc. (a procession of forms of sense data), but it does\nnot reveal any causal relatedness to interpret it (any form of process\nto render it intelligible). In fact, all \u201crelatedness of\nnature\u201d, and not only its causal relatedness, was\n\u201cdemolished by Hume\u2019s youthful skepticism\u201d (1922\n[2004: 13]) and conceived as the outcome of mere psychological\nassociation. Whitehead wrote:\n\n\nSense-perception, for all its practical importance, is very\nsuperficial in its disclosure of the nature of things. \u2026 My\nquarrel with [Hume] concerns [his] exclusive stress upon\nsense-perception for the provision of data respecting Nature.\nSense-perception does not provide the data in terms of which we\ninterpret it. (1934 [2011: 21])\n\n\nWhitehead was also dissatisfied with Newton\u2019s scientific\nmaterialism,\n\n\nwhich presupposes the ultimate fact of an irreducible brute matter, or\nmaterial, spread through space in a flux of configurations. In itself\nsuch a material is senseless, valueless, purposeless. It just does\nwhat it does do, following a fixed routine imposed by external\nrelations which do not spring from the nature of its being.\n(1925 [1967: 17])\n\n\nWhitehead rejected Newton\u2019s conception of nature as the\nsuccession of instants of spatial distribution of bits of matter for\ntwo reasons. First: the concept of a \u201cdurationless\u201d\ninstant, \u201cwithout reference to any other instant\u201d, renders\nunintelligible the concepts of \u201cvelocity at an instant\u201d\nand \u201cmomentum at an instant\u201d as well as the equations of\nmotion involving these concepts (1934 [2011: 47]). Second: the concept\nof self-sufficient and isolated bits of matter, having \u201cthe\nproperty of simple location in space and time\u201d (1925 [1967:\n49]), cannot \u201cgive the slightest warrant for the law of\ngravitation\u201d that Newton postulated (1934 [2011: 34]). Whitehead\nwrote:\n\n\nNewton\u2019s methodology for physics was an overwhelming success.\nBut the forces which he introduced left Nature still without meaning\nor value. In the essence of a material body\u2014in its mass, motion,\nand shape\u2014there was no reason for the law of gravitation. (1934\n[2011: 23])\n\nThere is merely a formula for succession. But there is an absence of\nunderstandable causation for that formula for that succession. (1934\n[2011: 53\u201354])\n\n\n\u201cCombining Newton and Hume\u201d, Whitehead summarized,\n\n\nwe obtain a barren concept, namely, a field of perception devoid of\nany data for its own interpretation, and a system of interpretation\ndevoid of any reason for the concurrence of its factors. (1934 [2011:\n25])\n\n\n\u201cTwo conclusions\u201d, Whitehead wrote,\n\n\nare now abundantly clear. One is that sense-perception omits any\ndiscrimination of the fundamental activities within Nature. \u2026\nThe second conclusion is the failure of science to endow its formulae\nfor activity with any meaning. (1934 [2011: 65])\n\n\nThe views of Newton and Hume, Whitehead continued, are \u201cgravely\ndefective. They are right as far as they go. But they omit \u2026\nour intuitive modes of understanding\u201d (1934 [2011: 26]).\n\nIn Whitehead\u2019s eyes, however, the development of Maxwell\u2019s\ntheory of electromagnetism constituted an antidote to Newton\u2019s\nscientific materialism, for it led him to conceive the whole universe\nas \u201ca field of force\u2014or, in other words, a field of\nincessant activity\u201d (1934 [2011: 27]). The theory of\nelectromagnetism served Whitehead to overcome Newton\u2019s\n\u201cfallacy of simple location\u201d (1925 [1967: 49]), that\nis, the conception of nature as a universe of self-sufficient isolated\nbits of matter. Indeed, we cannot say of an electromagnetic event that\nit is\n\n\nhere in space, and here in time, or here in space-time, in a perfectly\ndefinite sense which does not require for its explanation any\nreference to other regions of space-time. (1925 [1967: 49])\n\n\nThe theory of electromagnetism \u201cinvolves the entire abandonment\nof the notion that simple location is the primary way in which things\nare involved in space-time\u201d because it reveals that, \u201cin a\ncertain sense, everything is everywhere at all times\u201d\n(1925 [1967: 91]). \u201cLong ago\u201d, Whitehead wrote,\nFaraday already remarked \u201cthat in a sense an electric charge is\neverywhere\u201d, and:\n\n\nthe modification of the electromagnetic field at every point of space\nat each instant owing to the past history of each electron is another\nway of stating the same fact. (1920 [1986: 148])\n\n\nThe lesson that Whitehead learned from the theory of electromagnetism\nis unambiguous:\n\n\nThe fundamental concepts are activity and process. \u2026 The notion\nof self-sufficient isolation is not exemplified in modern physics.\nThere are no essentially self-contained activities within limited\nregions. \u2026 Nature is a theatre for the interrelations of\nactivities. All things change, the activities and their\ninterrelations. \u2026 In the place of the procession of [spatial]\nforms (of externally related bits of matter, modern physics) has\nsubstituted the notion of the forms of process. It has thus swept away\nspace and matter, and has substituted the study of the internal\nrelations within a complex state of activity. (1934 [2011:\n35\u201336])\n\n\nBut overcoming Newton was insufficient for Whitehead because Hume\n\u201chas even robbed us of reason for believing that the past gives\nany ground for expectation of the future\u201d (1934 [2011: 65]).\nAccording to Whitehead,\n\n\nscience conceived as resting on mere sense-perception, with no other\nsources of observation, is bankrupt, so far as concerns its claims to\nself-sufficiency. (1934 [2011: 66])\n\n\nIn fact, science conceived as restricting itself to the sensationalist\nmethodology can find neither efficient nor final causality. It\n\u201ccan find no creativity in Nature; it finds mere rules of\nsuccession\u201d (1934 [2011: 66]). \u201cThe reason for this\nblindness\u201d, according to Whitehead, \u201clies in the fact that\nsuch science only deals with half of the evidence provided by human\nexperience\u201d (1934 [2011: 66]).\n\nContrary to Hume, Whitehead held that it is untrue to state that our\nperception, in which sense perception is only one factor, discloses no\ncausal relatedness. Inspired by the radical empiricism of William\nJames and Henri Bergson, Whitehead gave a new analysis of perception.\nAccording to Whitehead, our perception is a symbolic interplay of two\npure modes of perception, pure sense perception (which Whitehead\nultimately called \u201cperception in the mode of presentational\nimmediacy\u201d), and a more basic perception of causal relatedness\n(which he called \u201cperception in the mode of causal\nefficacy\u201d). According to Whitehead, taking into account the\nwhole of our perception instead of only pure sense perception, that\nis, all perceptual data instead of only Hume\u2019s sense data,\nimplies also taking into account the other half of the evidence,\nnamely, our intuitions of the relatedness of nature, of \u201cthe\ntogetherness of things\u201d. He added:\n\n\nthe togetherness of things involves some doctrine of mutual immanence.\nIn some sense or other \u2026 each happening is a factor in the\nnature of every other happening. (1934 [2011: 87])\n\n\nHume demolished the relatedness of nature; Whitehead restored it,\nfounded the \u201cdoctrine of causation \u2026 on the doctrine of\nimmanence\u201d, and wrote: \u201cEach occasion presupposes the\nantecedent world as active in its own nature. \u2026 This is the\ndoctrine of causation\u201d (1934 [2011: 88\u201389]).\n\nWhitehead also noticed that, in a sense, physicists are even more\nreductionist than Hume. In practice they rely on sense data, but in\ntheory they abstract from most of the data of our five senses (sight,\nhearing, smell, taste, and touch) to focus on the colorless,\nsoundless, odorless, and tasteless mathematical aspects of nature.\nConsequently, in a worldview inspired not by the actual practices of\nphysicists, but by their theoretical speculations,\nnature\u2014methodologically stripped from its \u2018tertiary\u2019\nqualities (esthetical, ethical, and religious values)\u2014is further\nreduced to the scientific world of \u2018primary\u2019 qualities\n(mathematical quantities and interconnections such as the amplitude,\nlength, and frequency of mathematical waves), and this scientific\nworld is bifurcated from the world of \u2018secondary\u2019\nqualities (colors, sounds, smells, etc.). Moreover, the former world\nis supposed, ultimately, to fully explain the latter world (so that,\nfor example, colors end up as being nothing more than electromagnetic\nwave-frequencies).\n\nWhitehead spoke of the \u201cbifurcation of nature into two systems\nof reality\u201d (1920 [1986: 30]) to denote the\nstrategy\u2014originating with Galileo, Descartes, Boyle and\nLocke\u2014of bifurcating nature into the essential reality of\nprimary qualities and the non-essential reality of \u201cpsychic\nadditions\u201d or secondary qualities, ultimately to be explained\naway in terms of primary qualities. Whitehead sided with Berkeley in\narguing that the primary/secondary distinction is not tenable (1920\n[1986: 43\u201344]), that all qualities are \u201cin the same boat,\nto sink or swim together\u201d (1920 [1986: 148]), and that, for\nexample,\n\n\nthe red glow of the sunset should be as much part of nature as are the\nmolecules and electric waves by which men of science would explain the\nphenomenon. (1920 [1986: 29])\n\n\nWhitehead described the philosophical outcome of the bifurcation of\nnature as follows:\n\n\nThe primary qualities are the essential qualities of substances whose\nspatio-temporal relationships constitute nature. \u2026 The\noccurrences of nature are in some way apprehended by minds \u2026\nBut the mind in apprehending also experiences sensations which,\nproperly speaking, are qualities of the mind alone. These sensations\nare projected by the mind so as to clothe appropriate bodies in\nexternal nature. Thus the bodies are perceived as with qualities which\nin reality do not belong to them, qualities which in fact are purely\nthe offspring of the mind. Thus nature gets credit which should in\ntruth be reserved for ourselves: the rose for its scent: the\nnightingale for his song: and the sun for his radiance. The poets are\nentirely mistaken. They should address their lyrics to themselves, and\nshould turn them into odes of self-congratulation on the excellency of\nthe human mind. Nature is a dull affair, soundless, scentless,\ncolourless; merely the hurrying of material, endlessly, meaninglessly.\n(1925 [1967: 54])\n\n\n\u201cThe enormous success of the scientific abstractions\u201d,\nWhitehead wrote, \u201chas foisted onto philosophy the task of\naccepting them as the most concrete rendering of fact\u201d and, he\nadded:\n\n\nThereby, modern philosophy has been ruined. It has oscillated in a\ncomplex manner between three extremes. There are the dualists, who\naccept matter and mind as on an equal basis, and the two varieties of\nmonists, those who put mind inside matter, and those who put matter\ninside mind. But this juggling with abstractions can never overcome\nthe inherent confusion introduced by the ascription of misplaced\nconcreteness to the scientific scheme. (1925 [1967: 55])\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s alternative is fighting \u201cthe Fallacy of\nMisplaced Concreteness\u201d\u2014the \u201cerror of mistaking the\nabstract for the concrete\u201d\u2014because \u201cthis fallacy is\nthe occasion of great confusion in philosophy\u201d (1925 [1967:\n51]). The fallacy of misplaced concreteness is committed each time\nabstractions are taken as concrete facts, and \u201cmore concrete\nfacts\u201d are expressed \u201cunder the guise of very abstract\nlogical constructions\u201d (1925 [1967: 50\u201351]). This\nfallacy lies at the root of the modern philosophical confusions of\nscientific materialism and progressive bifurcation of nature. Indeed,\nthe notion of simple location in Newton\u2019s scientific materialism\nis an instance of the fallacy of misplaced concreteness\u2014it\nmistakes the abstraction of in essence unrelated bits of matter as the\nmost concrete reality from which to explain the relatedness of nature.\nAnd the bifurcating idea that secondary qualities should be explained\nin terms of primary qualities is also an instance of this\nfallacy\u2014it mistakes the mathematical abstractions of physics as\nthe most concrete and so-called primary reality from which to explain\nthe so-called secondary reality of colors, sounds, etc.\n\nIn light of the rise of electrodynamics, relativity, and quantum\nmechanics, Whitehead challenged scientific materialism and the\nbifurcation of nature \u201cas being entirely unsuited to the\nscientific situation at which we have now arrived\u201d, and he\nclearly outlined the mission of philosophy as he saw it:\n\n\nI hold that philosophy is the critic of abstractions. Its function is\nthe double one, first of harmonising them by assigning to them their\nright relative status as abstractions, and secondly of completing them\nby direct comparison with more concrete intuitions of the universe,\nand thereby promoting the formation of more complete schemes of\nthought. It is in respect to this comparison that the testimony of\ngreat poets is of such importance. Their survival is evidence that\nthey express deep intuitions of mankind penetrating into what is\nuniversal in concrete fact. Philosophy is not one among the sciences\nwith its own little scheme of abstractions which it works away at\nperfecting and improving. It is the survey of the sciences, with the\nspecial object of their harmony, and of their completion. It brings to\nthis task, not only the evidence of the separate sciences, but also\nits own appeal to concrete experience.
