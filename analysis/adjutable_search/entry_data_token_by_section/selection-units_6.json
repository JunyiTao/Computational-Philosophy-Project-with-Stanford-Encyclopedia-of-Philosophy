What is the replicator? What is the\nbeneficiary? And what entity manifests any adaptations resulting from\nevolution by selection? There is a serious ambiguity in the meaning of\n\u201cadaptation\u201d; which meaning is in play has had deep\nconsequences for both the group selection debates and the species\nselection debates (Lloyd 2001). Commenting on this analysis, John\nMaynard Smith wrote in Evolution: \n\n\n[Lloyd 2001] argues, correctly I believe, that much of the confusion\nhas arisen because the same terms have been used with different\nmeanings by different authors \u2026 [but] I fear that the\nconfusions she mentions will not easily be ended. (Maynard Smith 2001:\n1497) \n\n\nIn\n section 3,\n this taxonomy of questions is used to sort out some of the most\ninfluential positions in five debates: group selection\n (3.1),\n species selection\n (3.2),\n genic selection\n (3.3),\n genic pluralism\n (3.4),\n as well as units of evolutionary transition\n (3.5).\n",
