    "main_text": "Objections to Emotivism and Relativism\n8. Objections to Emotivism and Relativism\n\nA we have seen, Russell\u2019s meta-ethic was closely connected to his\nprogram of moral reform. The idea was to advocate a set of humane and\negalitarian ends, using non-rational methods of persuasion, and then\nto argue on the basis of psychology, social science, history and\ncommon sense that that these ends would be best achieved if, on the\nwhole, people obeyed a reformed moral code. Judgments that this or\nthat is good or bad were to be construed as disguised optatives\n(\u201cWould that everyone desired X!\u201d and \u201cWould\nthat everyone desired not Y!\u201d respectively).\n\u201cOught\u201d and \u201cright\u201d were to be given a\nconsequentialist reading and indexed to the ends that Russell hoped\nhis audience could be persuaded to share. Thus Russell combined an\nemotivist analysis of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d with a\nconsequentialist/relativist reading of \u201cought\u201d and\n\u201cright\u201d. But was he right to do so?\n\nAlthough Russell and Santayana were toying with emotivism in the\n1910s, it was not until the 1930s that the theory really hit the\nphilosophical headlines. Since then it has taken a beating, and\nalthough it still finds favor with the semi-philosophical public, it\nis no longer widely believed by professional philosophers. Relativism\nlikewise is generally regarded as a down-list option, though, as with\nemotivism, there are one or two distinguished philosophers who are\nprepared to stick up for it. Does Russell\u2019s meta-ethic stand up\nagainst the objections that have laid emotivism and relativism\nlow?\n",
