Phenomenological aspects of nothingness\n\nAfter a mystical experience in 1654, Blaise Pascal\u2019s interest in\nnothingness passed from its significance to science to the\nsignificance of nothingness to the human condition. Pascal thinks\nhuman beings have a unique perspective on their finitude. His\nPens\u00e9es is a roller coaster ride surveying the human\nlot. Pascal elevates us to the level of angels by exalting in our\ngrasp of the infinite, and then runs us down below the beasts for\nwittingly choosing evil over goodness. From this valley of depravity\nPascal takes us up again by marveling at how human beings tower over\nthe microscopic kingdom, only to plunge us down toward insignificance\nby having us dwell on the vastness of space, and the immensity of\neternity.\n\nHe who regards himself in this light will be afraid of himself, and\nobserving himself sustained in the body given him by nature between\nthose two abysses of the Infinite and Nothing, will tremble at the\nsight of these marvels; and I think that, as his curiosity changes\ninto admiration, he will be more disposed to contemplate them in\nsilence than to examine them with presumption.\n\n\nFor in fact what is man in nature? A Nothing in comparison with the\nInfinite, an All in comparison with the Nothing, a mean between\nnothing and everything. Since he is infinitely removed from\ncomprehending the extremes, the end of things and their beginning are\nhopelessly hidden from him in an impenetrable secret; he is equally\nincapable of seeing the Nothing from which he was made, and the\nInfinite in which he is swallowed up. (Pens\u00e9es sect.\nII, 72)\n\n\nPascal\u2019s association of nothingness with insignificance and\nmeaninglessness was amplified by the Romantics. Their poetry\nde-emphasized salvation, seeking to immerse the reader in a raw\napprehension of nature, unmediated by reason. Kant further obscured\nGod by casting Him into the noumenal abyss, available only through\npractical faith rather than theoretical reason.\n\nAs among the first forthright atheists, Arthur Schopenhauer faced the\nfull force of \u2018Why is there something rather than\nnothing?\u2019. According to Schopenhauer, religion and rationalism\naim to reassure us that the universe has a design. Our astonishment\nthat there is anything betrays awareness that it is all a meaningless\naccident.\n\nReaders of Schopenhauer were presented with the awesome contingency as\nan actuality rather than a terrible possibility. The experience\ncaptured the attention of William James (who experimented with nitrous\noxide to understand the oceanic philosophy of Georg Hegel and, in\n1882, published this phenomenological investigation in Mind).\nJames provides a simple recipe for eliciting the emotion:\n\n\nOne need only shut oneself in a closet and begin to think of the fact\nof one\u2019s being there, of one\u2019s queer bodily shape in the\ndarkness \u2026 of one\u2019s fantastic character and all, to have\nthe wonder steal over the detail as much as over the general fact of\nbeing, and to see that it is only familiarity that blunts it. Not only\nthat anything should be, but that this very thing\nshould be, is mysterious! (1911, 39)\n\n\nAnother emotional reader of Schopenhauer, Ludwig Wittgenstein,\ncharacterizes this unsettling phenomenology as exhausting the thrust\nof the riddle of existence. Instead of expressing a well-formed\nquestion, \u2018Why is there something rather than nothing?\u2019 is\na brute expression of awe.\n\n\n6.44 It is not how things are in the world that is mystical, but that\nit exists.\n\n6.45 To view the world sub specie aeterni is to view it as a\nwhole\u2014as a limited whole. Feeling the world as a limited\nwhole\u2014it is this that is mystical.\n\n6.5 When an answer cannot be put into words, neither can the\nquestion\u2014the riddle does not exist. (From Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus)\n\n\nThis visceral characterization persists into Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlater philosophy. In Lectures on Ethics, Wittgenstein uses\nthe language of seeing-as. \u2018Why is there something rather than\nnothing?\u2019 is a prompt to see the world as a miracle. This\ngestalt switch is not a mistake. Nor is it an insight. Even the\nlogical positivists were willing to grant the question has emotive\nmeaning (just not cognitive meaning).\n\nThe characteristic phenomenology of the question has also been\nsuggested as a resource in explaining why we fail to recognize the\nradical ambiguity of the question. Andrew Brenner (2016, 1319)\nconjectures that the multiplicity of interpretations is masked by the\nemotional unity.\n\nThinkers in the tradition of Phenomenology retained\nSchopenhauer\u2019s conviction that the emotion harbors a\nmetaphysical insight. Instead of tossing the question into the\nemotivist waste basket, like the logical positivists, or lapsing into\nquietism, like Wittgenstein, existentialists provide detailed\ntreatments of the awe expressed by the ultimate question. They built\non Schopenhauer\u2019s literary approach to philosophy, depicting the\nemotion in plays and novels such as Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s\nNausea. Like the arch-pessimist Schopenhauer, Sartre\u2019s\nprotagonist experiences our crowded world as de trop,\nover-stuffed with accidental beings. Sartre himself, after an\nunpleasant experiment with mescaline, was chronically creeped out by\nthe country-side vegetation edging its way into Paris.\n\nIn The Concept of Dread, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1844)\nclaims that nothingness wells up into our awareness through moods and\nemotions. Emotions are intentional states; they are directed toward\nsomething. If angered, I am angry at something. If amused,\nthere is something I find amusing. Free floating anxiety is often\ncited as a counterexample. But Kierkegaard says that in this case the\nemotion is directed at nothingness.\n\nAccording to Heidegger, we have several motives to shy away from the\nsignificance of our emotional encounters with nothingness. They are\npremonitions of the nothingness of death. They echo the groundlessness\nof human existence.\n\nSome have hoped that our recognition of our rootlessness would rescue\nmeaning from the chaos of nothing. But Heidegger denies us such\nsolace.\n\nHeidegger does think freedom is rooted in nothingness. He also says we\nderive our concept of logical negation from this experience of\nnothing. This suggests a privileged perspective for human beings. We\ndiffer from animals with respect to nothing.\n",
