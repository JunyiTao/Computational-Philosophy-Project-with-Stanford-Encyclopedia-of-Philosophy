    "main_text": "\n\nF. H. Bradley (1846\u20131924) was the most famous, original and\nphilosophically influential of the British Idealists. These\nphilosophers came to prominence in the closing decades of the\nnineteenth century, but their effect on British philosophy and society\nat large \u2014 and, through the positions of power attained by some\nof their pupils in the institutions of the British Empire, on much of\nthe world \u2014 persisted well into the first half of the twentieth.\nThey stood out amongst their peers in consciously rejecting some main\naspects of the tradition of their earlier compatriots, such as Hume\nand Mill, and responding, albeit in an original and critical fashion,\nrather to the work of Kant and Hegel.\n\nBut it would involve a significant degree of distortion to depict the\nBritish Idealists as simply choosing Hegel over Hume, as the\ndenomination \u2018Neo-Hegelians\u2019 all too easily suggests. On\nthe contrary, they were open to a variety of influences, including the\nphilosophy of an anti-idealist thinker such as J.F. Herbart and of the\nsubsequently forgotten but then prominent Hermann Lotze, an\nindependent mind whose speculations are difficult to classify in terms\nof the idealist/realist opposition. Upon the whole, the Idealists\nrevitalized British philosophy by making it permeable to a rich\nvariety of continental ideas. In this way, they helped prepare the\nground on which analytic philosophy would eventually flourish, as most\nIdealists were very well acquainted with the works of Frege\u2019s\ncontemporaries (e.g. Sigwart) and discussed their ideas in their\nlogical treatises. Bradley was a leading figure in this movement of\noriginal reappropriation of alien ideas, which he explicitly promoted\nas the sole antidote to dogmatism and intellectual sclerosis in the\n\u2018Preface\u2019 to Appearance and Reality. \u2018The\npresent generation\u2019, he said, \u2018is learning that to gain\neducation a man must study in more than one school\u2019 (p.\nviii).\n\nIt is for his metaphysics that Bradley has become best known. He\nargued that our everyday conceptions of the world (as well as those\nmore refined ones common among his philosophical predecessors) contain\nhidden contradictions which appear, fatally, when we try to think out\ntheir consequences. In particular, Bradley rejected on these grounds\nthe view that reality can be understood as consisting of many objects\nexisting independently of each other (pluralism) and of our experience\nof them (realism). Consistently, his own view combined substance\nmonism \u2014 the claim that reality is one, that there are no real\nseparate things \u2014 with metaphysical idealism \u2014 the claim\nthat reality consists solely of idea or experience. This vision of the\nworld had a profound effect on the verse of T.S. Eliot, who studied\nphilosophy at Harvard and wrote a Ph.D. thesis on Bradley.\n\nOn later generations of philosophers, however, Bradley\u2019s\ncontributions to moral philosophy and the philosophy of logic were far\nmore influential than his metaphysics. His critical examination of\nhedonism \u2014 the view that the goal of morality is the\nmaximization of general pleasure \u2014 was seminal and stands as a\npermanent contribution to the subject which can still be read with\nprofit today. Some of the doctrines of his logic have become standard\nand unnoticed assumptions through their acceptance by Bertrand\nRussell, an acceptance which survived Russell\u2019s subsequent\nrepudiation of idealist logic and metaphysics.\n\nOther notable figures among the British Idealists were Bernard\nBosanquet, Edward Caird, T.H. Green, Harold Joachim and J.M.E.\nMcTaggart.\n",
