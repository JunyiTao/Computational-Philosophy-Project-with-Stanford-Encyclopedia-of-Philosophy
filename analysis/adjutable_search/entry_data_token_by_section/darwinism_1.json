    "main_text": "Darwin and Darwinism || Darwin\u2019s Life\n2.1 Darwin\u2019s Life\n\n\nCharles Darwin was born February 12, 1809 and died April 18, 1882. It\nwas a time of radical changes in British culture, and his family\nbackground put him in the midst of those changes. His grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, was\na prosperous and highly respected physician living in Western England,\nsouth of Birmingham. He was also a philosophical radical, advocating Enlightenment ideas about human equality and\nliberty, including the liberty to think freely about the existence of\nGod and about natural origins for the earth\u2019s creatures. He wrote a\nnumber of very popular works of natural history, some in verse, in\nwhich he defended views about progress that included evolutionary\nspeculations about the upward progress of living things from\nprimordial beginnings.  \n\n\nErasmus Darwin was an early member of an informal group of free\nthinkers self-styled the Lunar\n Society,[3]\n that met regularly in Birmingham to discuss everything from the\nlatest philosophical and scientific ideas to the latest advances in\ntechnology and industry. The Society included James Watt, Joseph\nPriestly and Charles Darwin\u2019s other grandfather, Josiah Wedgwood.\nWedgwood, like Erasmus Darwin, lived in Staffordshire and was in the\nprocess of developing a family pottery works into a major industrial\nconcern by applying new scientific and technological ideas to the\nproduction of \u2018china\u2019.  The religious inclinations of the\ngroup were \u2018non-conforming\u2019 and included a number of\nUnitarians, a sect Erasmus Darwin referred to as \u2018a featherbed\nto catch a falling Christian\u2019. Looked upon with suspicion by\nHigh Church conservatives, they actively promoted in Great Britain the\nrevolutionary philosophical, scientific and political ideas sweeping\nacross Europe and the Americas.  Most had spent considerable time\nabsorbing Enlightenment ideas in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\n\n Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that Robert Darwin,\nCharles\u2019 father, should follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and\nbecome a doctor, nor that he should end up marrying Susannah Wedgwood,\nby all reports Josiah\u2019s favorite offspring. Politically and\nphilosophically engaged, Susannah worked to organize her children\u2019s\neducation in the town of Shrewsbury, where she and Robert took up\nresidence. She sent her children to a day school operated by Unitarian\nminister Rev. George Case and this is where Charles began his\neducation. Unfortunately, Susannah died in 1817 when Charles was only\n8, and his father then transferred him to the Shrewsbury School,\noperated by Dr. Samuel Butler, grandfather of the novelist (and\nsometime satirist of Darwin\u2019s work) of the same name.  \u201cNothing\ncould have been worse for the development of my mind than Dr. Butler\u2019s\nschool\u201d Charles proclaimed in the autobiography he wrote for his\nfamily, and he escaped down the street to his home whenever he\ncould. \n\n\nHis older siblings took good care of him, under the Doctor\u2019s watchful\neye. Early letters indicate that he and his brother Erasmus were\nenthusiastic amateur chemists, and after his brother went up to Cambridge\ntheir letters were often full of possible experiments, orders to\npurchase chemicals and equipment for their \u2018laboratory\u2019,\nand discussions of the latest discoveries. This was an obvious enough\npassion that his classmates nicknamed him \u2018Gas\u2019. During\nsummers he helped his father on his rounds to his patients, and when\nonly 16 his father sent him and his brother to Edinburgh for the best\nmedical education Great Britain had to offer. Erasmus needed to move\nfrom Cambridge to a proper medical school to complete his medical\neducation, and young Charles was taken out of Shrewsbury School early\nto accompany his brother to Edinburgh, apparently being prepared to\nfollow in his father\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s footsteps in medicine. The\ntwo brothers arrived in Edinburgh in October of 1825. Erasmus left\nafter the first year, leaving his brother on his own during his second\nyear at Edinburgh. \n\n\nPrivately, Darwin early on decided he could not practice medicine. But\nhis already serious inclination toward science was considerably\nstrengthened at Edinburgh both by some fine scientific lectures in\nchemistry, geology and anatomy and by the mentoring of Dr. Robert\nGrant. Grant certainly knew that young Charles was Erasmus Darwin\u2019s\ngrandson; Grant expounded evolutionary ideas derived from\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles\u2019 grandfather. But his primary\ngift to Charles was introducing him to marine invertebrate anatomy and\nthe use of the microscope as a scientific tool and as an aid to\ndissecting extremely small creatures dredged out of the Firth of\nForth. Darwin joined an Edinburgh scientific society, the Plinean\nsociety, of which Grant was a prominent member, and presented two\nlectures that reported discoveries he had made while working with\nGrant. This interest in marine invertebrates was to be a life long\nobsession, climaxing in his massive four-volume contribution to the\ncomparative anatomy and systematics of fossil and living Cirripedia or\n\u2018barnacles\u2019 (Barrett & Freeman 1988,\nvols. 11\u201313).\n\n\nWhen he finally broke the news of his distaste for medicine to his\nfather, he enrolled to take a degree in Divinity at Christ\nCollege, Cambridge University, from which he graduated in January of\n1831. As with the Shrewsbury School and Edinburgh, his official course\nof study had very little impact on him, but while in Cambridge he\nbefriended two young men attempting to institute serious reforms in the\nnatural science curriculum at Cambridge, Rev. John Henslow, trained in botany and\nmineralogy, and Rev. Adam Sedgwick, a leading member of the rapidly\nexpanding community of geologists. Henslow and his wife treated Darwin\nalmost as a son, and through Henslow Darwin was introduced to the men\nwhose ideas were currently being debated in geology and natural\nhistory, as well as to men whom we look back on as among the very first\nto take up the historical and philosophical foundations of science as\na distinct discipline, Sir John Herschel and Rev. William Whewell. As\nhe wrote in his autobiography:\n\n\nDuring my last year at Cambridge, I read with care and profound\ninterest Humboldt\u2019s Personal Narrative. This work, and Sir\nJ. Herschel\u2019s Introduction to the Study of Natural\n Philosophy,[4]\n stirred up in me a burning zeal to add even the most humble\ncontribution to the noble structure of Natural Science. No one or a\ndozen other books influenced me nearly so much as these\ntwo.\n\n\nIn the next section we will discuss the influence of the philosophical\nideals of Herschel and Lyell on Darwin.\n\n\nFurthering his scientific training, Adam Sedgwick on two occasions\ntook Darwin on extended geological tours of England and Wales. In\naddition Darwin and a cousin, William Darwin Fox, a year ahead of him\nat Cambridge, developed what began as an amateur passion for bug\ncollecting into serious entomology. \n",
