    "main_text": "An Outline of Brentano\u2019s Theory || Part I: Judgements Versus Presentations\n1.1 Part I: Judgements Versus Presentations\n\nAs a philosopher of mind, Brentano takes it to be his task to develop\nspecific accounts of whatever phenomena one finds in inner experience.\nTo do so, one has to pay close attention to the different ways in\nwhich phenomena are directed toward something (see PES 197 [II 32; SVS\n1, 218]), and Kriegel 2017: 99ff). Applying this method to the case of\njudgement, Brentano arrives at the claim that judgements are clearly\ndistinguishable from presentations. The question that concerns him is\nhow precisely they differ. Brentano invokes three negative\nclaims to draw that distinction: \n\n(1)\nCombining two ideas/marks (Merkmale)[3]\n in thought is not sufficient for making a judgement.\n\n\nWhen someone asks me \u201cIs any tree red?\u201d I will combine\nthese ideas in pondering the question, but how much I combine them, I\nmight still remain undecided whether they exist together or not. That\nsuffices to make claim (1) plausible.\n\nClaim (1)\n is compatible with the view that judging always means to hold true a\nproposition. For Brentano, that is not the right way to understand\nclaim (1) however. In order to rule out that interpretation, Brentano\ninvokes the following pair of claims:\n\n(2)\nCombining two ideas/marks (Merkmale) in thought is not necessary\nfor making a judgement.\n(3)\nCombining two ideas/marks (Merkmale) is necessary in formulating a\nsentence or a proposition.\n\n\nTogether, claims (2) and (3) imply that judgements can be made without\njudging a sentence or proposition to be true. That is what Brentano\ntries to establish. Let us see how he tries to achieve this goal.\n\nBrentano considers three possible ways of conceiving of the difference\nbetween presentations and judgements. There may be (i) an intrinsic\ndifference between them, (ii) they may differ in their contents\n(Inhalte), or (iii) in a perfection [Vollkommenheit] with\nwhich these objects are thought (PES 204, [II 42f.; SVS 1, 226]).\n\nLet\u2019s start with (i). What would it mean that the distinction\nbetween judgement and presentation is not intrinsic, i.e.,\nextrinsic? It would mean that the distinction between judgement and\npresentation consists in a relational property that one of these\nmental phenomena has while the other lacks it. In this sense the\ndistinction between a bachelor and a husband is extrinsic: bachelors\nlack the relational property of being married to someone; husbands\nhave it. Nothing else distinguishes bachelors and husbands from each\nother: there is no intrinsic property of husbands or bachelors that\ngrounds the relational difference. Is the distinction between\njudgement and presentation like the distinction between husbands and\nbachelors? According to Alexander Bain, it is. For Bain there are two\nkinds of ideas (presentations): those that dispose one to\nact\u2014this is the extrinsic or relational property\u2014and\nothers that don\u2019t. The former are judgements and beliefs, the\nlatter are mere presentations (see Bain 1872: 372f). Mill (1878:\n403\u20134) criticized Bain\u2019s proposal as incomplete. In\ngeneral, a dispositional property like disposing one to act on an\nobject is grounded in its categorical properties. Hence, the\nbelief-constituting disposition to act must be grounded in categorical\nproperties of ideas and these properties seem to be intrinsic. The\nrelational difference is not brute as in the husband/bachelor\ncase.\n\nBrentano finds Mill\u2019s line of thought persuasive (see PES 202f.\n[II 40; SVS 1,\n 224]).[4]\n By Brentano\u2019s lights, any explanation of the distinction\nbetween judgement and presentation in terms of a difference in\n\u201cimpact\u201d on mental states or actions is\n unsatisfactory.[5]\n Like Mill, he goes for the first of the three options above: the\ndifference between presentations and judgement is an intrinsic\none.\n\nOn to (ii). Is the intrinsic difference between judgement and\npresentation one that concerns the content of the mental mental\nphenomena under consideration? According to the view opposed by\nBrentano, every judgement is a combining or separating of marks\n[Merkmale]. The content of a judgement is the combination of at least\ntwo marks that are either divided or combined in it. Possessing a\ncontent is an intrinsic property of a judgement: every judgement must\nhave a content and the content distinguishes a judgement, in part,\nfrom other mental phenomena. Do judgements and presentations differ in\ncontent (cf. PES 205 [II 44; SVS 1, 227])? Again Brentano\u2019s\nanswer is NO. If I wonder whether there are red trees, the content of\nmy presentation is a combination of the marks redness and tree(hood).\nMy judgement that there are red trees has the same content as the mere\npresentation of a red\n tree.[6]\n\nThis brings us to (iii). Is the intrinsic difference between judgement\nand presentation one that concerns a perfection in which mental\nphenomena that have the same object differ? Brentano identifies the\nperfection as strength, intensity or\nvivacity of the mental phenomena concerned. Is, as Brentano\nsays, \u201ca judgement a stronger presentation and a presentation a\nweaker judgement\u201d? (PES 204 [II 44; SVS 1, 226]; author\ntranslation) Brentano says NO. A strong presentation is no judgement.\nThis argument, while suggestive, is not persuasive because the notion\nof strength, vividness or intensity seems unclear. However, in the\nsecond edition Brentano adds an important consideration that improves\nthe argument. If presentation and judgement were distinguished in\nstrength, both would need to have positions on a scale of strength.\nHowever, Brentano now doubts that there is one scale of intensity or\nstrength on which presentations and judgements both lie. Different\ndegrees of conviction that may accompany an act of judgement should\nnot be confused with the degrees of intensity with which an object can\nbe presented to the mind, e.g., in sensation (PES 286f. [II 151ff.;\nSVS 1, 401). If there is not one dimension of strength in which both\njudgement and presentation can differ, strength cannot distinguish\nbetween them.\n\nBrentano concludes that the distinction between judgement and\npresentation is intrinsic and irreducible to other distinctions\nbetween these mental phenomena. Hillebrand (1891: 26\u20137) called\nBrentano\u2019s view therefore an \u201cidiogenetic\u201d theory of\njudgement\u2014it takes judgement to be a fundamental kind of mental\nphenomenon\u2014while \u201callogenetic\u201d theories take\njudgements to be composed out of other mental phenomena that belong to\nfundamental kinds.\n",
