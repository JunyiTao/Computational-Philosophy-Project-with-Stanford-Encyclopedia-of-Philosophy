    "main_text": "Life and Writings || London\n1.4 London\n\nFor well over half of his adult life\u2014from late 1849 until his\ndeath in 1883\u2014Marx lived in London, a city providing a secure\nhaven for political exiles and a superb vantage point from which to\nstudy the world\u2019s most advanced capitalist economy. This third\nand longest exile was dominated by an intellectual and personal\nstruggle to complete his critique of political economy, but his\ntheoretical output extended far beyond that project.\n\nMarx\u2019s initial attempt to make sense of Napoleon III\u2019s\nrise to power in contemporary France is contained in The\nEighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852). Between 1852 and\n1862 Marx also wrote well over three hundred articles for the New\nYork Daily Tribune; sometimes unfairly disparaged as merely\nincome-generating journalism, they frequently contain illuminating\nattempts to explain contemporary European society and politics\n(including European interventions in India and China) to an American\naudience (helpfully) presumed to know little about them.\n\nThe second of Marx\u2019s two especially intense periods of political\nactivity\u2014after the revolutions of 1848\u2014centred on his\ninvolvement in the International Working Men\u2019s Association\nbetween 1864 and 1874, and the events of the Paris Commune (1871), in\nparticular. The character and lessons of the Commune\u2014the\nshort-lived, and violently suppressed, municipal rebellion that\ncontrolled Paris for several months in the aftermath of the\nFranco-Prussian war\u2014are discussed in The Civil War in\nFrance (1871). Also politically important was Marx\u2019s\n\u201cCritique of the Gotha Programme\u201d (1875), in which he\ncriticises the theoretical influence of Ferdinand Lassalle\n(1825\u20131864) on the German labour movement, and portrays the\nhigher stage of a future communist society as endorsing distribution\naccording to \u201cthe needs principle\u201d.\n\nMarx\u2019s critique of political economy remains controversial. He\nnever succeeded in fixing and realising the wider project that he\nenvisaged. Volume One of Capital, published in 1867, was the\nonly significant part of the project published in his own lifetime,\nand even here he was unable to resist heavily reworking subsequent\neditions (especially the French version of 1872\u201375). What we now\nknow as Volume Two and Volume Three of Capital were put\ntogether from Marx\u2019s raw materials by Engels and published in\n1885 and 1894, respectively, and Marx\u2019s own drafts were written\nbefore the publication of Volume One and barely touched by him in the\nremaining fifteen years of his life. An additional three supplementary\nvolumes planned by Engels, and subsequently called Theories of\nSurplus Value (or, more colloquially, the \u201cfourth volume of\nCapital\u201d) were assembled from remaining notes by Karl\nKautsky (1854\u20131938), and published between 1905 and 1910. (The\nsection of the \u201cnew MEGA\u201d\u2014see below\u2014concerned\nwith Capital-related texts contains fifteen thick volumes,\nand provides some sense of the extent and character of these later\neditorial interventions.) In addition, the publication in 1953\u2014a\nprevious two-volume edition (1939 and 1941) had only a highly\nrestricted circulation\u2014of the so-called Grundrisse\n(written in 1857\u201358) was also important. Whether this text is\ntreated as a freestanding work or as a preparatory step towards\nCapital, it raises many questions about Marx\u2019s method,\nhis relation to G.W.F. Hegel (1770\u20131831), and the evolution of\nMarx\u2019s thought. In contrast, the work of political economy that\nMarx did publish in this period\u2014A Contribution to a Critique\nof Political Economy (1859)\u2014was largely ignored by both\ncontemporaries and later commentators, except for the, much reprinted\nand discussed, summary sketch of his theory of history that Marx\noffered in the so-called \u201c1859 Preface\u201d to that\nvolume.\n\nMarx\u2019s later years (after the Paris Commune) are the subject of\nmuch interpretative disagreement. His inability to deliver the later\nvolumes of Capital is often seen as emblematic of a wider and\nmore systematic intellectual failure (Stedman Jones 2016). However,\nothers have stressed Marx\u2019s continued intellectual creativity in\nthis period, as he variously rethought his views about: the core and\nperiphery of the international economic system; the scope of his\ntheory of history; social anthropology; and the economic and political\nevolution of Russia (Shanin 1983; K. Anderson 2010).\n\nAfter the death of his wife, in 1881, Marx\u2019s life was dominated\nby illness, and travel aimed at improving his health (convalescent\ndestinations including the Isle of Wight, Karlsbad, Jersey, and\nAlgiers). Marx died in March 1883, two months after the death of his\neldest daughter. His estate was valued at \u00a3250.\n\nEngels\u2019s wider role in the evolution of, and, more especially\nthe reception and interpretation of, Marx\u2019s work is much\ndisputed. The truth here is complex, and Engels is not always\nwell-treated in the literature. Marx and Engels are sometimes\nportrayed as if they were a single entity, of one mind on all matters,\nwhose individual views on any topic can be found simply by consulting\nthe other. Others present Engels as the distorter and manipulator of\nMarx\u2019s thought, responsible for any element of Marxian theory\nwith which the relevant commentator might disagree. Despite their\nfamiliarity, neither caricature seems plausible or fair. The\nbest-known jointly authored texts are The Holy\nFamily, the \u201cGerman Ideology\u201d manuscripts, and\nThe Communist Manifesto, but there are nearly two hundred\nshorter items that they both contributed to (Draper 1985:\n2\u201319).\n\nMany of Marx\u2019s best-known writings remained unpublished before\nhis death. The attempt to establish a reliable collected edition has\nproved lengthy and fraught. The authoritative\nMarx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe, the so-called \u201cnew\nMEGA\u201d (1975\u2013), is still a work in progress, begun\nunder Soviet auspices but since 1990 under the guidance of the\n\u201cInternational Marx-Engels Stiftung\u201d (IMES). In its\ncurrent form\u2014much scaled-down from its original\nambitions\u2014the edition will contain some 114 volumes (well over a\nhalf of which are published at the time of writing). In addition to\nhis various published and unpublished works, it includes Marx\u2019s\njournalism, correspondence, drafts, and (some) notebooks. Texts are\npublished in their original language (variously German, English, and\nFrench). For those needing to utilise English-language resources, the\nfifty volume Marx Engels Collected Works (1975\u20132004)\ncan be recommended. (References to Marx and Engels quotations here are\nto these MECW volumes.) There are also several useful single\nvolume selections of Marx and Engels writings in English (including\nMarx 2000).\n",
