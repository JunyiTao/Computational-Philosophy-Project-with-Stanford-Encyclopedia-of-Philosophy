    "main_text": "Dialetheism in the History of Philosophy || Dialetheism in Western Philosophy\n2.1 Dialetheism in Western Philosophy\n\nAristotle takes a number of the Presocratics to endorse dialetheism,\nand with apparent justification. For example, in Fragment 49a,\nHeraclitus says: \u201cWe step and do not step into the same rivers;\nwe are and we are not\u201d (Robinson, 1987, p. 35). Protagorean\nrelativism may be expressed by the view that man is the measure of all\nthings; but according to Aristotle, since \u201cMany men hold beliefs\nin which they conflict with one another\u201d, it follows that\n\u201cthe same thing must be and not be\u201d (1009a10\u201312).\nThe Presocratic views triggered Aristotle\u2019s attack in\nMetaphysics, Book \\(\\Gamma\\). Chapter 4 of this Book contains\nAristotle\u2019s defence of the LNC. As we said above, historically\nAristotle was almost completely successful: the LNC has been orthodoxy\nin Western Philosophy ever since.\n\nAs an aside, and as mentioned above, there is an often-remarked upon\nduality between truth-value gaps and truth-value gluts (Parsons 1990).\nAnd yet, it is perhaps worth noting that in Metaphysics\n\\(\\Gamma\\) (Chapter 7) Aristotle also defends the dual of the LNC, the\nLaw of Excluded Middle, LEM, particularly in the version which has\nnowadays been distinguished as the Law of Bivalence: for any \\(A\\), it\nis necessary for (at least) one of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) to be true.\nBut the LEM has often had a less secure place in Western Philosophy\nthan the LNC, in spite of the numerous obvious dualities between the\ntwo principles. Aristotle himself, at least according to one\ninterpretation, appears to attack the Law in De\nInterpretatione, Chapter 9, when he comes to the famous subject\nof\n future contingents.\n\nDespite the orthodoxy about the LNC since Aristotle, during the Middle\nAges the problem of seemingly true contradictions surfaced in\nconnection to the paradoxes of divine omnipotence\u2014for instance:\ncan God make a stone too heavy for Him to lift? (See Cotnoir 2018.) We\nfind St. Pier Damiani getting close to dialetheism in the De\ndivina omnipotentia, by blaming St. Girolamus for having claimed\nthat God cannot overturn the past and twist what happened into\nsomething that didn\u2019t happen. Since God lives an eternal\npresent, denying Him power over the past equates to denying Him power\nover current and future events, which is blasphemous. So God must have\nthe power of making what is done undone. Later on, Nicholas of Cusa\nplaced at the core of his book De docta ignorantia the idea\nthat God is coincidentia oppositorum: as a truly infinite\nbeing, He includes all opposite and incompatible properties, therefore\nbeing all things, and none of them: God has all properties, including\ncontradictory ones (Heron, 1954, I.4).\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues that some\ncontradictions, the antinomies of pure reason (concerning time, space,\nand other categories), are produced by an illicit use of pure\nconcepts; nevertheless, he also holds such an illicit use to be a\n\u201cnatural and inevitable illusion\u201d (Kant, 1781, p.\n300)\u2014a side effect of reason\u2019s pursuit of completeness in\nknowledge. Reasoning about the world as a whole, a totality which is\nnever given to us as such, can lead us to apparently dialetheic\nconclusions: e.g. that it has a beginning in time and a limit in\nspace, and that it has no beginning nor limits in space, that it is\ninfinite in space and time. Both horns assume the opposite thesis and\nseemingly perform a reductio. (In Kantian terms, the\n\u201ctranscendental illusion\u201d begins when we turn what should\njust be a regulative ideal into a limit-object.) According to Kant, at\nleast in one way of resolving the antinomies, the fallacy lies in\ntreating the world as a whole as an object\u2014in mistaking a\nsubjective \u201ccondition\u201d, as Kant says, for an objective\nreality.\n\nNow, according to Hegel such a conception has something to be said for\nit as well as against it. Kant has a point in showing, via the\nantinomies, that dialectics is \u201ca necessary function of\nreason\u201d, and in defending \u201cthe necessity of the\ncontradiction which belongs to the nature of thought\ndeterminations\u201d (Hegel, 1831, p. 56). However, Kant takes from\nthis only the familiar result that reason is incapable of knowing the\nAbsolute, that is, actual reality. A dialetheic interpretation holds\nthat, on the contrary, we should abandon such \u201ctenderness for\nthe things of this world\u201d, and the idea that \u201cthe stain of\ncontradiction ought not to be in the essence of what is in the world;\nit has to belong only to thinking reason\u201d (Hegel, 1830,\np. 92). On a dialetheic interpretation, contrary to what Kant held,\nthe Kantian antinomies are not a reductio of the illusions of\nreason; they are perfectly sound arguments, deducing the dialetheic\nnature of the world. (For a reconstruction of this Kantian-Hegelian\ndebate, see Part II of Priest 2002.) Hegel himself has been\ninterpreted as being a dialetheist. Notably, d\u2019Agostini argues that\nwhile Hegel held that some conjunctions of contradictory sentences are\ntrue, he did so without the further commitment that either of the two\ncontradictory terms are separately true; see d\u2019Agostini 2021.\n",
