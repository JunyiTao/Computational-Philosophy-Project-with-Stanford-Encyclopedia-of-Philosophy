Establishing Sovereign Authority\n\nWhen people mutually covenant each to the others to obey a common\nauthority, they have established what Hobbes calls \u201csovereignty\nby institution\u201d. When, threatened by a conqueror, they covenant\nfor protection by promising obedience, they have established\n\u201csovereignty by acquisition\u201d. These are equally legitimate\nways of establishing sovereignty, according to Hobbes, and their\nunderlying motivation is the same\u2014namely fear\u2014whether of\none\u2019s fellows or of a conqueror. The social covenant involves\nboth the renunciation or transfer of right and the authorization of\nthe sovereign power. Political legitimacy depends not on how a\ngovernment came to power, but only on whether it can effectively\nprotect those who have consented to obey it; political obligation ends\nwhen protection ceases.\n",
