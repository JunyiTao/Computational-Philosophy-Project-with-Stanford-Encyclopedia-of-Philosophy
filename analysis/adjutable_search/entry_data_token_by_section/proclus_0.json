    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nSince Proclus\u2019 extant works contain almost no evidence about\nhis biography, we have to rely on the information transmitted by his\ndirect pupil Marinus of Neapolis in the eulogy he devoted to his\npredecessor Proclus or on Happiness. Moreover, some scattered\nremarks on Proclus and valuable information about the schools in Athens\nand Alexandria can be found in Damascius\u2019 Life of\nIsidorus (called by other scholars The Philosophical\nHistory). As with Porphyry\u2019s Life of Plotinus, both\nMarinus\u2019 and Damascius\u2019 works are biographies written by\nstudents praising extensively the achievements of their teachers both\nin doctrine and in philosophical life.\n\n\nOn Proclus\u2019 works see Beutler (1957), 190\u2013208, Saffrey-Westerink\n(1968), lv\u2013lx, Ros\u00e1n (\u00b22009), 266\u2013274, and\nespecially Luna\u2013Segonds\u2013Endress (2012), as well as the\nshort overview given below (1.2). Although a large part of his\nnumerous writings is lost, some major commentaries on Plato have\nsurvived (though incomplete) and some important systematic\nworks. Moreover, later Neoplatonists such as Damascius, Olympiodorus,\nSimplicius, and Philoponus have conserved many extracts of lost work,\nbut these fragments have never been collected (see now, however,\nLuna\u2013Segonds\u2013Endress (2012)).\n",
