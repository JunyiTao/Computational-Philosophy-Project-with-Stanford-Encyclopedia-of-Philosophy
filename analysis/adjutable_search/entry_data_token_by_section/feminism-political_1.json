Contemporary Approaches and Debates\n\nPolitical philosophy today is significantly more interesting, complex,\nand capacious thanks to feminist interventions in the field. While the\nprevious section traces these interventions in broad terms, showing\nhow political philosophy has been transformed as a result, this\nsection will provide more detailed descriptions of some of the major\nsites of concern, debate, and critique animating feminist political\nphilosophy. Because feminist political philosophy is often\ndistinguished by its attention to the concrete realities shaping the\nlives of women, differences among women (cultural, social, economic,\nexperiential) drive the rich diversity of work being done in this\nfield, and difference itself is a major topic for theorizing\nwith respect to foundational concepts like justice, freedom, and\nequality. Thus, it is important to emphasize that there is no\none feminist perspective shaping work in feminist political\nphilosophy, but a rich variety of perspectives emerging from\nparticular contexts, histories, and traditions. They are sometimes in\ntension with each other.\n\nNow in the second decade of the twenty-first century, feminist\ntheorists are doing an extraordinary variety of work on matters\npolitical and democratic that confront new and/or pressing challenges.\nSimilar developments in the areas of global ethics, public policy,\nhuman rights, disabilities studies, bioethics, climate change, and\ninternational development blur the distinction between theory and\npractice in philosophically generative ways.\n\nFor example, in global ethics there is a debate over whether there are\nuniversal values of justice and freedom that should be intentionally\ncultivated for women in the developing world or whether cultural\ndiversity should be prioritized. Feminist theorists have sought to\nanswer this question in a number of different and compelling ways.\n(For some examples see Ackerly 2000; Ackerly & Okin 1999; Benhabib\n2002 and 2006; Butler 2000; Gould 2004; Khader 2019; Abu-Lughod 2013;\nNussbaum 1999a; and Zerilli 2009; see also the entry on\n feminist perspectives on globalization.)\n\n\nModern abolitionist feminism is driven by the contributions of Black\nfeminist philosophers like Angela Davis (2003, 2005, 2016, and in\nDavis, Dent, Meiners, & Richie 2022), whose work on the racialized\nprison industrial complex has helped spur the social-political\nmovement to abolish prisons and develop new theories of restorative\njustice. Contemporary feminist theories of abolitionism have also\nbuilt on\n Michel Foucault\u2019s\n critique of the prison, generating new work on political resistance\nto social structures of incarceration, as well as new ways of\nexploring foundational political concepts like privacy, freedom, and\njustice (Pitts 2021b; Zurn & Dilts [ed.] 2016; Zurn 2021). (See\nalso Ruth Wilson Gilmore 2007 and 2022; Davis, Dent, Meiners, &\nRichie 2022; Guenther 2013; Montford & Taylor [eds] 2022.)\n\nThe work of feminist legal theorists (see the entry on\n feminist philosophy of law)\n has been transformative on both the theory and policy fronts. In her\n1989 article \u201cDemarginalizing the Intersection of Race and\nSex\u201d Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw critiqued\n\u201csingle-axis\u201d legal frameworks for failing to address\nrace- and gender-based discrimination occurring at the intersection of\nmultiple identities (Crenshaw 1989). Instead, she promoted an\nintersectional framework and, along with many others,\ndeveloped a theory of intersectionality as an analytic\nframework for understanding how compounded and intermeshed systems of\nprivilege and oppression structure experience (see also\n section 2.6\n below). Along with Crenshaw, Anita Allen (2011), Martha Fineman (2008\n[2011]), Catherine MacKinnon (1987, 1989), Mari J. Matsuda (1986,\n1996), and Patricia J. Williams (1991) are prominent legal scholars\nwhose work has made significant contributions to debates in feminist\npolitical philosophy.\n\nFeminists contributions in\n ethics and moral psychology\n that emphasize relations of care have also had a major impact on\npolitical philosophy. This intervention has challenged masculinist\ncharacterizations of political subjects as highly independent and\nrational, as well as core concepts within political philosophy (e.g.,\njustice, freedom, rights, sovereignty, and autonomy) derived from that\ncharacterization (see also\n section 2.5\n below).\n\nLikewise, new philosophical work on disabilities, as the entry on\n feminist perspectives on disability\n explains, is informed by a great deal of feminist theory, from\nstandpoint philosophy to feminist phenomenology and feminist care\nethics, as well as political philosophical questions of identity,\ndifference, and diversity (see also Kittay & Carlson [ed.] 2010).\nFeminist political philosophers like Martha Nussbaum (2006) have drawn\non the insights of philosophers of disability to offer new conceptions\nof justice (i.e., the capabilities approach).\n\nUltimately, the number of approaches that can be taken on any of these\nissues are as many as the number of philosophers there are working on\nthem. The remainder of this entry will outline a variety of approaches\nto central concerns in feminist political philosophy, noting general\nfamily resemblances among these approaches (i.e., liberal feminist,\nradical feminist, Marxist feminist, socialist feminist) and\nhighlighting new constellations that have emerged (e.g.,\nintersectional feminisms).\n",
