    "main_text": "Development of Analytic Philosophy in Latin America || Mexico (1940\u20131990)\n2.2 Mexico (1940\u20131990)\n\nMexican analytic philosophy originated with a group of\nphilosophers trained in phenomenology, existentialism, the history of\nphilosophy, and influenced by Marxism. Their teachers were Spanish\nphilosophers who emigrated to Mexico in the late 1930s and the first\nprofessional Mexican philosophers at\n UNAM.[21]\n Hence, the development of Mexican analytic philosophy is closely tied\nto UNAM and, as will become clear, the Instituto de Investigaciones\nFilos\u00f3ficas (IIFs). Although analytic philosophy started to\nspread to other Mexican institutions in the 1970s, IIFs remains the\nmain analytic center in the country. The first Mexican analytic\nphilosophers saw philosophical analysis as a critical tool to move\naway from the European conceptions of philosophy they were familiar\nwith and as a methodological device to realize the phenomenological\nideal of philosophy as a rigorous science.\n\nIn Positivismo, neopositivismo y fenomenolog\u00eda (1941),\nAntonio Caso compared logical positivism with nineteenth-century\npositivism and phenomenology. Building on phenomenology and idealism,\nhe underlined the explanatory limits of the scientific method (Dussel\net al. 2009). In the mid-1950s, his student Nicol\u00e1s Molina\ndefended logical positivism and started a project to translate some of\nthe main works from that movement.[22]\n\nJos\u00e9 Gaos was the most influential philosopher in Mexico from\n1940 to 1960. He embraced a radical form of historicism: philosophy\nconsisted in a series of personal systems of the world that were\ninextricably tied to the individual\u2019s own circumstances (Valero\n2012; Ziri\u00f3n 2021). Alejandro Rossi, one of his students,\nthought of Gaos\u2019 view as an extreme form of relativism that led\nto skepticism about philosophy (Rossi 1970).\n\nIn 1959, Gaos and his students organized an event commemorating the\nfifty years of the publication of Husserl\u2019s book Philosophy\nas Rigorous Science. Alejandro Rossi saw in Husserl\u2019s work\na confrontation between Gaos\u2019 historicist view of philosophy and\na view of philosophy as a rigorous science. Rossi also saw in the\nanalytic philosophy he had started to explore a way of turning\nphilosophy into a rigorous science (Rossi 1996). After the Husserl\nevent, Rossi went to Oxford in 1961, and got first-hand knowledge of\nthe latest developments in Oxonian philosophy.\n\nWhen Rossi returned to UNAM, he taught philosophy of language. These\nteaching activities enabled him to prepare a series of articles in\nthat area. Rossi examined definite descriptions like \u201cThe actual\nking of France\u201d, defending the Strawsonian view according to\nwhich those who use definite descriptions do not say that\nthere is a unique king of France but presuppose it (Ezcurdia 2015). In\nhis article \u201cNombres propios\u201d, Rossi anticipated some of\nthe problems of descriptivism underlined by Kripke (1980) and others\n(Fern\u00e1ndez and Vald\u00e9s 2009). These and other articles\nwere later reprinted in Lenguaje y significado\n (1969).[23]\n[24]\n\nThe creation and development of IIFs played an important role in the\nintroduction and consolidation of analytic philosophy in Mexico.\nEduardo Garc\u00eda M\u00e1ynez\u2014a philosopher of law trained\nin phenomenology\u2014was appointed as the dean of the Facultad de\nFilosof\u00eda y Letras (FFyL) at UNAM in 1940. Shortly after, he\ncreated the Centro de Estudios Filos\u00f3ficos. In 1945,\nthe Centro became independent from FFyL and the governing\nboard of UNAM appointed Garc\u00eda M\u00e1ynez as its first\nchair. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1ynez held that position for twenty\nyears. The Centro initially lacked an analytic orientation.\nHowever, its autonomy from FFyL prepared the conditions for the\ndevelopment of analytic philosophy in the 1970s. In the preceding\nyears, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1ynez worked on the creation of a\nspecialized library in philosophy, the first full-time research jobs\nin philosophy, and an editorial\n program.[25]\n[26]\n\nFernando Salmer\u00f3n followed Garc\u00eda M\u00e1ynez as a\nchair of the Centro in early 1966. He stayed in office until\nthe end of 1977. Working in close collaboration with Rossi, he\npromoted an analytic turn at the Centro, which acquired its\ncurrent name (\u201cInstituto de Investigaciones\nFilos\u00f3ficas\u201d) in\n 1967.[27]\n Salmer\u00f3n described the Centro in 1966 as a place that\nwas not conducive to intellectual collaboration. Its researchers did\nnot share any common topics, they differed dramatically in their\ntraining, and they employed different methods (Salmer\u00f3n 1978).\nFor Salmer\u00f3n (1991a), philosophy is a collective endeavor that\nrequires a shared tradition, a common vocabulary, and the employment\nof the same methods. Hence, Salmer\u00f3n set himself the goal of\ntransforming the nascent IIFs into a space suitable for intellectual\ncollaboration. To that end, his administration pursued four\nstrategies. First, it trained undergraduate students in logic,\nphilosophy of science, and philosophy of language, and prepared them\nto pursue postgraduate studies at analytic centers abroad (mostly in\nBritain and the United States). Second, IIFs attracted renowned,\nexperienced researchers whose work was close to the analytic\ntradition. In this way, local philosophers like Wonfilio Trejo and\nLuis Villoro joined IIFs in 1974. Shortly after, three foreign\nphilosophers of science joined as well: Mario Otero, Mario Bunge, and\nUlises Moulines. Although most of them stayed at IIFs for short\nperiods of time, they left an important\n legacy.[28]\n Third, IIFs developed an ambitious program of visiting professors\nwith the aim of keeping the local community up to date with\ncontemporary debates. These visits were combined with the organization\nof events with prominent analytic philosophers as keynote speakers.\nFourth, IIFs developed an ambitious editorial program to translate key\nanalytic works into Spanish. Salmer\u00f3n\u2019s work as chair of\nIIFs consumed most of his middle age. Thus, his philosophical\ncontributions were heavily influenced by those endeavors. Some of his\nbest works are La filosof\u00eda y las actitudes morales\n(1971) and Ense\u00f1anza y filosof\u00eda\n (1991b).[29]\n\nAround 1964, Rossi had the idea of creating a philosophy journal\nexclusively devoted to analytic philosophy. Salmer\u00f3n and\nVilloro joined him in that project. They dubbed it\nCr\u00edtica and conceived it as the first vehicle for\ndiscussion amongst analytically oriented philosophers from all Latin\nAmerica and other continents. The first issue appeared in January\n1967. Its editors did not see analytic philosophy as a specific\nphilosophical school. They rather saw it as a critical tool to oppose\nprevalent philosophical trends and as an efficient method to develop\noriginal philosophical work in Latin America. On their view,\nphilosophical analysis could elevate philosophy to a higher level of\nprofessionalism because it would allow its practitioners to make clear\nand precise claims and arguments (Salmer\u00f3n 1991a).\n\nWith the end of Salmer\u00f3n\u2019s period in 1977 came the turn\nfor the analytic philosophers trained abroad to take the reins of\nIIFs. Hugo Marg\u00e1in came first. Unfortunately, he passed five\nmonths after his appointment as chair. Widely perceived as one of the\nbrightest philosophers of his generation, he published several\narticles from 1969 to 1977, collected in a posthumous book entitled\nRacionalidad, lenguaje y filosof\u00eda (1978). In that\nbook, Marg\u00e1in defended a naturalist approach to rationality\n(Salmer\u00f3n 1991a).\n\nEnrique Villanueva followed Marg\u00e1in and stayed in office from\n1978 to 1984. During that period, some iconic IIFs activities took\noff: the International Symposia of Philosophy and the\nC\u00e1tedra Jos\u00e9 Gaos, a named lecture series\nanalogous to the John Locke Lectures at Oxford\n(Ben\u00edtez 2010). Villanueva also continued\nSalmer\u00f3n\u2019s training program and hired many of IIFs\nbest-known researchers, such as Ra\u00fal Orayen and Mark\n Platts.[30]\n\nBetween the 1970s and the 1980s, there was a quantitative and\nqualitative growth in the production of analytic philosophy in Mexico\n(Ben\u00edtez 2010). The growth in academic output can be credited\nto two generations: philosophers who had been trained in phenomenology\nbut became interested in analytic philosophy and the new generation of\nanalytic philosophers who had received training abroad. The list of\nnames is large, so just two examples will be\n considered.[31]\n\nLuis Villoro was trained in phenomenology but was interested in\nanalytic philosophy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s, studying\nanalytic authors like Ayer, Carnap, and Russell. However, he never\nthought of analytic philosophy as an end in itself (Vald\u00e9s and\nFern\u00e1ndez 2009). He rather saw it as a means to reflect on\ntopics that were already present in his pre-analytic period but were\nnot part of the philosophical conversation in the analytic writings of\nhis time: the nature of ideology, the relations between knowledge and\nsocial life, and the possibility of transforming social praxis.\n\nCreer, saber, conocer (1982) is the most analytic of\nVilloro\u2019s works. It offers a dispositional analysis of belief,\nproposes a relativist solution to the Gettier problem, and defends a\npluralist view of knowledge with constitutive relations to practical\nrationality. Although Villoro agreed with Rossi and Salmer\u00f3n\nthat philosophical analysis was a good way of professionalizing\nphilosophy, he did not think of science as the only (or most\nimportant) form of knowledge. In addition to\n\u201csaber\u201d, exemplified by scientific knowledge, he\nvalued \u201csabidur\u00eda\u201d (a sui generis\nkind of wisdom that involves a form of truth defined in terms\nauthenticity rather than correspondence) and\n\u201cconocer\u201d (a form of acquaintance that relies on\npersonal experience and interpersonal relations). Villoro\u2019s work\nwas one of the first attempts at developing a technical vocabulary in\nSpanish for analytic\n epistemology.[32]\n\nMark Platts is an example of a philosopher trained abroad. He\ncompleted Ways of Meaning (1979) during his 1978 visit to\nIIFs. In that book, he explained Davidson\u2019s program of an\ninterpretation theory of truth capable of offering a theory of meaning\nfor a language and offered accounts of proper names, adjectives, and\nnatural kind terms. In 1984, Platts was appointed as a researcher at\nIIFs. In close collaboration with Rossi\u2019s students and Orayen,\nPlatts helped develop the area of philosophy of language. His works\nfrom the 1980s and 1990s focused on desire (Platts 1985, 1986, 1994).\nHe also initiated a public debate on the ethical issues raised by the\nAIDS epidemic.\n\nWith the appointment of Le\u00f3n Oliv\u00e9 as chair in 1985,\nIIFs entered an \u201cexpansion phase\u201d (Ben\u00edtez 2010).\nOliv\u00e9 worked towards making an impact on the cultural life of\nthe country and designed a graduate program in philosophy of\n science.[33]\n He also promoted the expansion of research areas (Ben\u00edtez\n2010) and made new appointments to support research in those areas.\nMany of those hires did not self-identify as analytic. Hence, at the\nend of Oliv\u00e9\u2019s period in the early 1990s, IIFs had\nchanged considerably.\n\nIt is not easy to square the works of all the philosophers who joined\nIIFs during Oliv\u00e9\u2019s term as pieces of analytic\nphilosophy. However, Carlos Pereda\u2019s work has analytic\novertones. Pereda has investigated the aims, motivations, types, and\nmechanisms of argumentation. He has pleaded for a broad concept of\nargumentation that goes beyond formal deduction and has used it to\ndevelop a novel concept of reason. He has opposed an austere view of\nreason as restricted to thoughts regimented by a formal calculus and\nadvocated for a reflective reason that admits figurative language and\nprobability, considers the history of concepts, and who says\nsomething and to whom they say\n it.[34]\n\nIn the 1990s, IIFs researchers had already made novel contributions to\na variety of topics, they had edited a prestigious journal devoted to\nanalytic philosophy, and IIFs attracted international students and\n researchers.[35]\n",
