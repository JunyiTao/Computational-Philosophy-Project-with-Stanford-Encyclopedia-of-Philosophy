    "main_text": "Some Key Remarks by Turing and Church || Church and the human computer\n7.3 Church and the human computer\n\nTuring placed the human computer center stage in his 1936 paper. Not\nso Church. Church did not mention computation or human computers\nexplicitly in either of his two groundbreaking papers on the\nEntscheidungsproblem (Church 1936a,b). He spoke of \u201ceffective\ncalculability\u201d, taking it for granted his readers would\nunderstand this term to be referring to human calculation. He\nalso used the term \u201ceffective method\u201d, again taking it for\ngranted that readers would understand him to be speaking of a humanly\nexecutable method.\n\nChurch also used the term \u201calgorithm\u201d, saying\n\n\nIt is clear that for any recursive function of positive integers there\nexists an algorithm using which any required particular value of the\nfunction can be effectively calculated. (Church 1936a: 351)\n\n\nHe said further that the notion of effective calculability could be\nspelled out as follows:\n\n\nby defining a function to be effectively calculable if there exists an\nalgorithm for the calculation of its values. (Church 1936a: 358)\n\n\nIt was in Church\u2019s review of Turing\u2019s 1936 paper that he\nbrought the human computer out of the shadows. He wrote:\n\n\n[A] human calculator, provided with pencil and paper and explicit\ninstructions, can be regarded as a kind of Turing machine. It is thus\nimmediately clear that computability, so defined [i.e., computability\nby a Turing machine], can be identified with (especially, is no less\ngeneral than) the notion of effectiveness as it appears in certain\nmathematical problems \u2026 and in general any problem which\nconcerns the discovery of an algorithm. (Church 1937a: 43)\n\n",
