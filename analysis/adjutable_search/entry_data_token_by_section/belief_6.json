    "main_text": "Types, Degrees, and Relatives of Belief || Occurrent Versus Dispositional Belief\n2.1 Occurrent Versus Dispositional Belief\n\nPhilosophers often distinguish dispositional (alternatively,\nstanding) from occurrent belief. This distinction\ndepends on the more general distinction between dispositions\nand occurrences. Examples of dispositional statements\ninclude:\n\n\n(1a) Corina runs a six-minute mile,\n\n(1b) Leopold is excitable,\n\n(1c) salt dissolves in water.\n\n\nThese statements can all be true even if, at the time they are\nuttered, Corina is asleep, Leopold is relaxed, and no salt is actually\ndissolved in any water. They thus contrast with statements about\nparticular occurrences, such as:\n\n\n(2a) Corina is running a six-minute mile,\n\n(2b) Leopold is excited,\n\n(2c) some salt is dissolving in water.\n\n\nAlthough (1a-c) can be true while (2a-c) are false, (1a-c) cannot be\ntrue unless there are conditions under which (2a-c) would be true. We\ncannot say that Corina runs a six-minute mile unless there are\nconditions under which she would in fact do so. A dispositional claim\nis a claim, not about anything that is actually occurring at the time,\nbut rather that some particular thing is prone to occur,\nunder certain circumstances.\n\nSuppose Harry thinks plaid ties are hideous. Only rarely does the\nthought or judgment that they are hideous actually come to the\nforefront of his mind. When it does, he possesses the belief\noccurrently. The rest of the time, Harry possesses the belief only\ndispositionally. The occurrent belief comes and goes, depending on\nwhether circumstances elicit it; the dispositional belief endures. The\ncommon representationalist warehouse model of memory and belief\nsuggests a way of thinking about this. A subject dispositionally\nbelieves P if a representation with the content P is\nstored in their memory or \u201cbelief box\u201d (in the central,\n\u201cexplicit\u201d case: see \u00a72.2). When that representation\nis retrieved from memory for active deployment in reasoning or\nplanning, the subject occurrently believes P. As soon as they\nmove to the next topic, the occurrent belief ceases.\n\nAs the last paragraph suggests, one needn\u2019t adopt a\ndispositional approach to belief in general to regard some beliefs as\ndispositional in the sense here described. In fact, a strict\ndispositionalism may entail the impossibility of occurrent belief: If\nto believe something is to embody a particular dispositional\nstructure, then a thought or judgment might not belong to the right\ncategory of things to count as a belief. The thought or judgment,\nP, may be a manifestation of an overall\ndispositional structure characteristic of the belief that P,\nbut it itself is not that structure.\n\nThough the distinction between occurrent and dispositional belief is\nwidely employed, it is rarely treated in detail. Important discussions\ninclude Price (1969), Armstrong (1973), Lycan (1986), Searle (1992),\nAudi (1994), and Bartlett (2018). David Hume (1740) famously offers an\naccount of belief that treats beliefs principally as occurrences (see\nthe section on Belief in\n Hume),\n in which he is partly followed by Braithwaite (1932\u20131933) and\nGertler (2007).\n",
