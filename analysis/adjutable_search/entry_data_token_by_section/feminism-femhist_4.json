Feminist Revisions of the History of Philosophy\nThese women are not women on the fringes of philosophy, but\nphilosophers on the fringes of history. \n\n\u2014Mary Ellen Waithe\n\n\n\nFeminist canon revision is most distinctive, and most radical, in\nits retrieval of women philosophers for the historical record, and in\nits placement of women in the canon of great philosophers. It is a\ndistinctive project because there is no comparable activity undertaken\nby other contemporary philosophical movements, for whom canon creation\nhas been largely a process of selection from an already established\nlist of male philosophers. It is a radical project because by\nuncovering a history of women philosophers, it has destroyed the\nalienating myth that philosophy was, and by implication is or ought to\nbe, a male preserve.\n\n\nIn A History of Women Philosophers Mary Ellen Waithe has\ndocumented at least 16 women philosophers in the classical world, 17\nwomen philosophers from 500\u20131600, and over 30 from 1600\u20131900.\n\n\nAnd, in the recent feminist series Re-reading the Canon\nseven of the thirty-five canonical philosophers are women: including Mary\nWollstonecraft, Hannah Arendt and Simone de Beauvoir. What is crucial\nto understand is that none of the three is canonical\u2014if by that you\nmean included in the history of philosophy as it is told in philosophy\ndepartment curricula, in histories of philosophy, and in scholarly\nwriting. Still, there has been progress.\n\n\nConsider that The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, published in\n1967, which contains articles on over 900 philosophers, did not\ninclude an entry for Wollstonecraft, Arendt or de Beauvoir. Moreover,\nif the index is to be believed, de Beauvoir and Wollstonecraft are not\nmentioned at all in any article, and Hannah Arendt merits a single\nmention in an article on \u201cAuthority\u201d.  Far from being canonical, these\nwomen philosophers were scarcely even marginal, warranting perhaps a\npassing reference in a survey of existentialism or political\nphilosophy, but little\n more.[10]\n By 1998, however, The Routledge\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy had entries for all three, and also\nmany other important women philosophers.\n\n\nThe project of retrieving women philosophers has a paradoxical\nrelationship with contemporary feminist theory, however. On the one\nhand, it is clearly a feminist project; its originators were interested\nin establishing that women have been philosophers throughout the\nhistory of the discipline despite their routine omission from standard\nhistories and encyclopedias of philosophy. However, the newly-recovered women philosophers suggest that there is little overlap\namong three groups: women philosophers, feminine philosophers and\nfeminist philosophers. For most of the newly discovered women\nphilosophers were not feminist thinkers nor did they write philosophy\nin a feminine voice, different from their male counterparts. Indeed,\ntheir breadth of philosophical interests is comparable to that of male\nphilosophers although their domain of application sometimes differs. In\nher introduction to A History of Women Philosophers Mary Ellen\nWaithe comments \u201cIf we except the Pythagorean women, we find little\ndifferences in the ways men and women did philosophy. Both have been\nconcerned with ethics, metaphysics, cosmology, epistemology and other\nareas of philosophic inquiry\u201d (Waithe 1987\u20131991 Vol. 1: xxi). And\nanother editor, Mary Warnock, comments \u201cIn the end, I have not found\nany clear \u2018voice\u2019 shared by women philosophers\u201d (Warnock 1996: xlvii).\nThe women philosophers restored to the tradition by feminist hands are\nnot all proto-feminists nor do they speak in a uniform, and different,\nvoice from their male peers.\n\n\nSimilarly, women philosophers who are candidates for initiation into\nthe philosophical canon\u2014like Mary Wollstonecraft, Hannah Arendt and\nSimone de Beauvoir\u2014are a diverse crew. According to Elizabeth\nYoung-Bruehl \u201cThat Hannah Arendt should have become a provocative\nsubject for feminists is startling\u201d presumably because of Arendt's\nexplicit criticism of feminism. And while Wollstonecraft and de\nBeauvoir were both feminists, they share neither a common philosophical\nvoice nor common philosophical principles. In The Vindication of\nthe Rights of Women Wollstonecraft argued for the education of\nwomen using Enlightenment principles, while Beauvoir's The Second\nSex reflects her marxist and existentialist roots.\n\n\nThe diversity of women philosophers raises the question why their\nrecovery or re-valuation is an important project for contemporary\nfeminist theory. What the retrieval of women philosophers, and their\ninclusion in the philosophical canon has done is to challenge the myth\nthat there are no women in the history of philosophy and the fallback\nposition that if there are any women philosophers, they are\nunimportant. Lovers of wisdom that we all are, we all benefit from the\ncorrection of these mistaken beliefs. Moreover, as feminists, we are\ninterested in correcting the effects of discrimination against women\nphilosophers, who were written out of history, unfairly, because of\ntheir gender not their philosophical ideas.\n\n\nHowever, what is really at issue is not philosophy's past, but its\npresent; its self-image as male. That self-image is created and\nmaintained in part by a tacit historical justification. It is a\ndamaging self-image for women philosophers today, and for women who\naspire to be philosophers. The real significance of uncovering the\npresence of women in our history, and in placing women in our canon is\nthe effect that has on the way we think about the \u201cus\u201d of\nphilosophy.\n\n\nThe rediscovery of women philosophers raises the following question:  \nHow can women philosophers be rewoven into the history of philosophy \nso that they are an integral part of that history?  Lisa Shapiro, considering the case of women philosophers in the \nearly modern period, argues that it is not enough to simply add a woman \nphilosopher or two to the reading list (Shapiro 1994).  Rather, according to Shapiro,\nwe need to provide internal reasons for the inclusion of women \nphilosophers rather than relying upon a feminist motivation on the part \nof the teacher or editor. The history of philosophy is a story and we \nneed to find a plot line that includes new, female characters.\n\n\nOne way to do this is to show how certain women philosophers made \nsignificant contributions to the work of male philosophers on central \nphilosophical issues.  We could call this the \u201cBest Supporting \nActress\u201d approach in that the central cast remains male and the story \nline of philosophy is undisturbed.  It is a good strategy for several \nreasons:  it is relatively easy to accomplish, and it provides an \ninternal anchor for women philosophers.  On the other hand, it \nreinforces the secondary status of women thinkers and if this were \nthe only way of integrating women philosophers, that would be an \nunfortunate result.  The wholly inadequate interpretation of  \nBeauvoir's philosophical thought as a mere application of  Jean-Paul \nSartre's is a good example of the limitations of this strategy.  Not \nonly does is reinforce a secondary, handmaiden role for Beauvoir, \nbut it also promotes a distorted understanding and appreciation of \nher thought (Simons 1995).\n\n\nAlternatively, we could find in the work of women philosophers issues\nthat they have developed in a sequential fashion.  Shapiro suggests \nthat there are certain philosophical issues concerning women's \nrationality, nature, and education that women philosophers of the \nseventeenth century discuss extensively in a sequential, interactive \nfashion. The thread extends into the following century in the work of  \nJean-Jacques Rousseau and Wollstonecraft. Since philosophers become \ncanonical as part of a story anchored at one end by contemporary \nphilosophical questions that are thought to be central, the task \nwould be to make these questions ones that we turn to the tradition \nfor help in answering.  And, of course, these are precisely the \ncentral questions posed and discussed extensively by contemporary \nfeminism.  Thus, the idea is that as we pose new kinds of questions \nto the history of philosophy we will find in women philosophers an \nimportant, sequential discussion that we can securely thread into \nour curricula and textbooks.\n\n\nAt this relatively early stage of the process of including women in\nthe history of philosophy we need all to use all three strategies.\nThere is nothing wrong with a purely external approach.  By all means\none should include a woman philosopher on a topic just to provide an\nindication that there are some interesting and important women working\non a particular topic.  And the strategy of anchoring a woman\nphilosopher's work to a male canonical figure can also be a useful\nstrategy as long as it is done in a manner that preserves the\nindependence and originality of her work.  Finally, it is important to\nask new questions of the tradition, questions that might allow some\nwomen philosophers to play a starring role rather than a walk-on\npart.\n",
