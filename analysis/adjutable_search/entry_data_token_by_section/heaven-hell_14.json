    "main_text": "Heaven: Three Critical Issues || Concerning the Misery of Loved Ones in Hell\n5.2 Concerning the Misery of Loved Ones in Hell\n\nAssuming that love ties people\u2019s interests together in the way\ndescribed in section 4.1 above, one might then wonder how God could\npreserve the happiness of those in heaven who know that some of their\nown loved ones are suffering forever in hell. For the question\ninevitably arises, \u201cHow could anyone remain happy knowing that a\ngenuine loved one, however corrupted, is destined to be miserable\nforever\u201d. When a reporter asked the mother of Ted\nBundy, a serial murderer of young women, whether she could still\nsupport a son who had become a monster, her answer provided a poignant\nillustration of the problem. \u201cOf course I support him,\u201d\nshe declared, as her eyes filled with tears and her body literally\nbegan shaking. \u201cHe is my son. I love him. I have to support\nhim.\u201d She obviously did not support his monstrous crimes, and\nneither did she even object to the severity of his punishment. But\nstill, one wonders how this suffering woman\u2014a committed\nChristian, by the way\u2014could ever achieve supreme happiness\nknowing that the son she continued to love was destined to be lost\nforever without any future hope of redemption.\n\nSuch considerations have led some, including the 19th\nCentury theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, to argue that the misery\nof those in hell would undermine altogether the blessedness of the\nredeemed in heaven (see Schleiermacher 1830, 721\u2013722; Kronen and\nReitan 2011, 80\u201389; and Talbott 1990b, 237\u2013241). But\nothers have argued that God could always shield forever the redeemed\nin heaven from painful memories of the lost in hell. William Lane\nCraig thus raises the possibility that God could simply\n\u201cobliterate\u201d from the minds of the redeemed \u201cany\nknowledge of lost persons so that they experience no pangs of remorse\nfor them\u201d (Craig, 1991, 306). Given the widespread theological\nview, which Craig seems to accept, that billions of people will\neventually be lost forever, one issue here concerns how much of some\npeople\u2019s minds, particularly those whose entire family is lost\nforever, God would have to wipe out in order to accomplish such a\nstrategy. Another concerns how God, as an infinitely loving being,\nmight expunge the infinitely more painful memories from his own mind.\nBut the main issue to be resolved here is whether blissful\nignorance qualifies as a worthwhile form of happiness at all.\n\nAs a matter of historical fact, in any case, some of the most\ninfluential theologians in the Western tradition, including some who\nare widely admired as heroes of faith, have not only made an eternal\ntorture chamber an important part of their teaching about hell; they\nseem also to have gloried in the idea that the torments of those\nwrithing in hell forever will increase the joy of those in heaven.\nJonathan Edwards thus wrote: \u201cWhen the saints in glory \u2026\nshall see how miserable others of their fellow-creatures are, who were\nnaturally in the same circumstances with themselves; when they shall\nsee the smoke of their torment, and the raging of the flames of their\nburning, and hear their dolorous shrieks and cries, and consider that\nthey [the saints] in the mean time are in the most blissful state and\nshall surely be in it to all eternity; how will they rejoice!\u201d\n(Edwards 1834, sec. II\n [available online]).\n Remarkably, Edwards was also a theological determinist who held that\nGod determined from the beginning to bring a huge number of people to\na horrific end and did so for the precise purpose of increasing the\njoy of the elect in heaven. He even insisted, contra Craig,\nthat the inhabitants of heaven and hell will be acutely aware of each\nother\u2019s condition; so even as the torments of former loved ones\nin hell will contribute to the joy of those in heaven, so the joy of\nformer loved ones in heaven will contribute to the psychological\ntorment of those in hell. He thus made the following kind of warning\nan important part of his preaching: \u201cHow will you bear to see\nyour parents, who in this life had so dear an affection for you, now\nwithout any love to you \u2026 How will you bear to see and hear\nthem praising the Judge, for his justice exercised in pronouncing this\nsentence, and hearing it with holy joy in their countenances, and\nshouting forth the praises and hallelujahs of God and Christ on that\naccount?\u201d (sec. IV).\n\nAs horrifying as such descriptions are apt to appear to someone such\nas Ted Bundy\u2019s mother, perhaps all parties can agree on one\nthing at least. If justice were to require that one suffer\neternally for sins that God himself causally determined, then such\nsuffering would have to be a source of satisfaction, if not outright\nbliss, on the part of any fair-minded person witnessing it. But since,\nas they say, one person\u2019s modus ponens is another\u2019s modus\n tollens,[12]\n a critic of Edwards will simply reply in the following way. No\nfair-minded person would find satisfaction in someone\u2019s\nexperiencing eternal torment as punishment for even the worst of sins,\nparticularly in the case of sins that God himself has causally\ndetermined; therefore, such torment is not what justice requires.\nAccording to Edwards\u2019s own theology, moreover, he was no less\ndeserving of eternal torment himself than are those who suffer in\nhell. Schleiermacher and many others therefore find it hard to\nunderstand how those who receive special favor in this regard could be\nso deliriously happy in the knowledge that some of their own loved\nones do not receive a similar special\n favor.[13]\n\n",
