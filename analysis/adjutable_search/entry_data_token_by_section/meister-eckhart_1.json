    "main_text": "Influences\n2. Influences\n\nAlthough Eckhart was an innovative and controversial figure, he was\nalso a product of his time\u2014and by those standards not nearly as\nheterodox as he is often made out to be. While much has been made of\nthe accusations against him, there has also been a significant effort\nby various Eckhart scholars to rehabilitate the Meister\u2019s\northodoxy and demonstrate his adherence to the theological and\nphilosophical doctrines from which his thought arose.\n\nSimilar to other thirteenth-century Dominicans of the Cologne School\nlike Albert the Great (d. 1280), Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274), and\nDietrich of Freiburg (d. 1310)\u2014all of whom exercised a\nsignificant influence on the young Dominican\u2014Eckhart\u2019s\nthought represents a kind of synthesis between, on the one hand, a\ndeeply Augustinian and Dionysian Christian Neoplatonism (one strongly\ninfluenced by Proclus and the Liber de causis) and, on the\nother hand, the late medieval scholastic Aristotelianism of the\nuniversities. Eckhart\u2019s own analysis of Aristotle was not\nseldomly filtered through the Jewish and Islamic sources available to\nhim in Latin\u2014most especially in the works of Maimonides,\nAvicenna, Averroes, and Avicebron (Palazzo 2013; Schwartz 2002).\nIndeed, in Eckhart\u2019s Latin works only Aristotle is cited more\nfrequently than Maimonides, leading Bernard McGinn to claim that\n\u201cno Christian author of the Middle Ages [\u2026] knew\nMaimonides better or reflected greater sympathy for his view\u201d\n(McGinn 1986: 17). In a similar vein, Kurt Flasch (2006 [2015])\ncharacterizes Eckhart as having inherited the \u201cspirit of Arabic\nphilosophy\u201d.\n\nWith respect to lesser known figures and movements, Eckhart\u2019s\nrelationship with his female contemporaries, especially Dominican nuns\nand the Beguines in Strasbourg\u2014as well as the similarities in\naspects of his thought to the work of Rhineland contemplatives like\nHadewijch of Antwerp (d. 1260), Mechthild of Magdeburg (d. c.1282),\nand especially Marguerite Porete (burned at the stake in Paris in 1310\nfor heresy)\u2014have been the subject of much speculation. It is\nstill debated as to whether Eckhart was explicitly familiar with\nMarguerite\u2019s Mirouer des simples \u00e2mes anienties\n[The Mirror of Simple Annihilated Souls]. We do know that he\nshared a residence with her inquisitor, William of Paris, the year\nafter her execution, and there are certainly striking parallels\nbetween some of the ideas in Eckhart\u2019s sermons and\nMarguerite\u2019s Mirouer (e.g., the metaphor of the\n\u201cspark\u201d of the soul and the divine as abyss, the notions\nof poverty or freedom of spirit, the negation or\n\u201cannihilation\u201d of the self-possessed soul, and the\nhypernomian allusions to the detached soul\u2019s transcendence of\nthe virtues). But their thought also diverges in significant\nways\u2014as can be seen, for example, in the stark contrast between\nEckhart\u2019s staunch intellectualism and Marguerite\u2019s\nrepeated emphasis on the supremacy of love over reason and intellect.\nThus, whether the parallels between the two more likely suggest a\ndirect connection between Marguerite and Eckhart, a third party who\nexercised influence on both individuals, or the cultural influence of\nideas that were simply \u201cin the air\u201d in the late thirteenth\nand early fourteenth centuries remains a topic for further research.\n(For more on comparisons between medieval women\u2019s spirituality\nand Eckhart\u2019s thought see, among others, Wegener 2013; Hollywood\n1995 [2001]; Sells 1994; and the collection of essays in McGinn\n1994.)\n",
