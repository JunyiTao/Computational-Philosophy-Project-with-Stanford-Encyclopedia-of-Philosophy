    "main_text": "Theology || Predestination\n3.2 Predestination\n\nPredestination was the traditional subject of distinctions 40\u201341\nof commentaries on book I of the Sentences. This was a more\npurely \u201ctheological\u201d subset of the more\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d topic of foreknowledge and future\ncontingents treated in distinctions 38\u201339. As in the case of\nforeknowledge, Gregory proceeded slowly and carefully, defining his\nterms and outlining the possible positions. Gregory\u2019s\nAugustinian bent shows through more clearly in predestination than in\nforeknowledge. Gregory quoted Augustine\u2019s words no less than 43\ntimes in this context, and cited him still more often. Frequent\nscriptural quotations, carefully chosen, provide the ultimate basis\nfor his theory. From Romans 9.13, where Paul comments on Malachi 1.2,\n\u201cJacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated,\u201d Gregory took\nhis position that from eternity, God actively elects to damn some and\nto save others, a theory called Double Predestination or Double\nParticular Election (Vignaux 1934, ch. 4; Sch\u00fcler 1934; Halverson\n1998, 143\u2013157; Schabel 2002).\n\nThe main issue is what the causal connection is between humans\u2019\nwilling and acting and their salvation or damnation, and\npredestination or reprobation: do humans participate in or contribute\nto their own salvation and damnation, or is God\u2019s will the sole\ncause? Traditionally the answer had been that humans are the cause of\ntheir deserved damnation, but that salvation depended solely on\nGod\u2019s will. Although there were various interpretations of this\ntraditional stance, Peter Auriol seems to have been the first\nimportant university scholar to provide a real alternative. Auriol had\nalready sought to distance God from the everyday details of the\nworld\u2019s existence, in order to preserve divine necessity and the\ncontingency of things. Auriol now applied his general theory to the\nspecific issue of soteriology and claimed that God sets up general\nrules by which certain sets of people will be damned and other sets\nsaved, without actively choosing to save or damn specific individuals.\nThis maintained divine immutability but had the added bonus of\nproviding symmetry for reprobation and predestination: the determining\nfactor is the presence or absence of an obstacle to grace (obex\ngratiae). For Auriol, while someone\u2019s obstacle to grace is\nindeed a positive cause of reprobation, the absence of such an\nobstacle, however, is merely a negative or privative cause of\npredestination. Thus Auriol thought he could avoid charges of\nPelagianism by simply denying a positive cause of\npredestination in the elect. Ockham appears to have adopted the main\nelements of Auriol\u2019s stance, while Walter Chatton at Oxford and\nGerard Odonis and Thomas of Strasbourg at Paris went further and\nposited a positive cause of predestination in the elect, which would\nappear to approach the condemned Pelagian doctrine.\n\nGregory reacted by charging that both the theory of the privative\ncause and the notion of the positive cause of predestination in those\nwho are predestined are Pelagian. Instead Gregory returned to the\ntraditional view as it concerned predestination: it stems only from\nGod\u2019s merciful will. However, Auriol\u2019s criticism of the\nasymmetry of the traditional position led Gregory to claim that not\nonly do the predestined play no causal role in their salvation, but\nneither do the reprobate contribute to their damnation. In short,\nthere is no reason either for one person\u2019s salvation or for\nanother person\u2019s damnation except the inscrutable will of God:\nwe do not know why some are saved and others damned. This, after all,\nGregory believed, was the theory of Paul and of Augustine.\n\nOne has to admire Gregory\u2019s consistency here, mirroring that of\nhis opponent, Peter Auriol. In the case of divine foreknowledge,\nAuriol provided an alternative to the traditional position because he\nclaimed that the common defense of contingency failed. Auriol\u2019s\ntheory allowed him to preserve the causal role of humans in\nreprobation, at the expense perhaps of involving humans in\npredestination and therefore coming close to Pelagianism. There were\nproblems with Auriol\u2019s stance, but it was consistent. Gregory,\non the other hand, agreed with the common position on divine\nforeknowledge, but when it really counted, in soteriology, Gregory\ntook this common position to what he (and Auriol) thought was its\nlogical conclusion. Since God\u2019s free creation and action is\nreally the only source of contingency in the world, then God\u2019s\nfree will is the only real cause of salvation and damnation. Salvation\nand damnation are contingent like anything else, but not contingent\nupon human free will, but merely on God\u2019s will. No doubt for\nGregory, everyone else who held the opinio communis should\nalso have held to Double Predestination or Double Particular Election.\nIndeed, at least one of Gregory\u2019s immediate predecessors, the\nCarmelite Guy Terrena, appears to have agreed (Schabel 2015). Luther\nand Calvin agreed with Gregory, but they saw no reason for the logical\ndevices of the opinio communis, which for them as for Auriol\ncould not save the contingency of human willing.\n",
