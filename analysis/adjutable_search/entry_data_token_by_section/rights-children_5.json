The Child\u2019s Right to Grow Up\n\nThe second sub-class of C-rights are those which Feinberg\ncharacterises as \u2018rights-in-trust\u2019 and which he thinks can\nbe subsumed under the single title of a \u2018right to an open\nfuture\u2019. These are the rights given to the child in the person\nof the adult she will become. They are the rights whose protection\nensures that, as an adult, she will be in a position to exercise her\nA- and A-C-rights to the maximal or at least to a very significant\ndegree. They keep her future open. Such rights impose limits on the\nrights of parents and also impose duties on the part of the state to\nprotect these rights.\n\nA couple of things are worth noting about these rights-in-trust.\nFirst, Feinberg refers to these C-rights as \u2018anticipatory\nautonomy rights\u2019, which might suggest that they are only\nA-rights-in-trust. But he also speaks of rights-in-trust of class C as\nprotecting those future interests a child will have as an adult. This\nimplies that they are also anticipatory welfare rights (Feinberg 1980,\n126\u20137). Hence this sub-class of C-rights ensures that the adult\ncan later exercise both her A-rights (liberty) and her A-C-rights\n(welfare).\n\nSecond, there is the question of how open a child\u2019s future\nshould be. Some interpret the demand for an education for an\n\u2018open future\u2019 as requiring individuals to acquire\n\u2018to the greatest possible extent\u2019 the capacity to choose\nbetween \u2018the widest possible variety of ways of life\u2019\n(Arneson and Shapiro 1996, 388). Arneson and Shapiro have pointed out several\nobjections to such a \u2018maximising\u2019 interpretation. It may\nnot be possible to quantify in a determinate fashion the number of\noptions open to a future adult. Furthermore, some fulfilling life\nchoices are only available at the expense of denying the child a\nnumber of otherwise possible choices. For instance, a child\nintensively trained to realise his considerable innate musical\nabilities may be unable to pursue careers that would have been open to\nhim in the absence of such a dedicated education. The following\nfurther criticisms can be added. Requiring that a child be brought up\nto be able eventually to choose between as many options as possible\nmay impose unreasonable burdens on parents. It also seems implausible\nto think that a child suffers if she is denied one or even several\npossible insignificant further options beyond some threshold number of\nchoices. Is it really harmful to a child that she does not learn to\nplay all of the orchestral instruments and is thereby denied the\nopportunity to pursue a solo career in those she does not? Finally,\nsome future options are surely morally base or in some other respect\nwithout value (Mills 2003).\n\nFeinberg does sometimes talk only of the harms of closing off\nsignificant life choices. Yet he does also on occasion employ the\nlanguage of maximisation. \u2018[Education] should send [the child]\nout into the adult world with as many open opportunities as possible,\nthus maximising his chances for self-fulfilment\u2019. (1980, 135;\nsee also 151). However, it seems much more plausible to suggest that a\nchild should have enough autonomy to be able to make reasonable life\nchoices. The preconditions of autonomy are both internal (a capacity\nto think for oneself, to acquire and appreciate relevant information,\nand a volitional ability to act independently) and external (the\nprovision of a range of feasible and valuable options). In respect of\nboth conditions, it is perfectly possible to have a good sense of what\ncounts as adequate autonomy, even if there is no clear bright line\nmarking the point of sufficiency.\n\nClosely related to Feinberg\u2019s idea of\n\u2018rights-in-trust\u2019 is Eekelaar\u2019s idea of a\nchild\u2019s \u2018developmental\u2019 rights (Eekelaar 1986).\nThese are the rights of a child to develop her potential so that she\nenters adulthood without disadvantage. Whereas Feinberg attributes the\nrights to the child\u2019s adult-self, the child holding them only in\n\u2018anticipatory\u2019 form, Eekelaar attributes the rights to the\nadult\u2019s child-self. Arguably, this makes no difference, since\nthe child and the adult are one and the same person. Although this is\na metaphysically contentious claim (Parfit 1984), grant that child and\nadult are merely distinct temporal stages of a single individual.\nWhether each temporal stage of the person has the same interest in the\nchild developing into an adult is a further issue which will be\nconsidered shortly.\n\nHowever, child and adult do stand in an asymmetrical relationship to\none another in a way that does not seem to be true of the different\ntemporal stages of the same adult. After all, adult Smith can now\nexercise her liberty rights in such a fashion that at a later time she\nis not able to exercise them and her welfare rights to the same degree\nas she can now. Smith can, for instance, choose now to enter into a\nslavery contract or to engage in a dangerous sport that risks death or\nserious disability. A child, on the other hand, is denied the right to\nmake choices that will fetter the adult exercise of her rights.\n\nThis can be justified by distinct thoughts. First, a child, unlike an\nadult, simply lacks the ability to make considered choices and should\nnot have liberty rights. An adult can make unwise choices but is\npresumed to possess a general minimal capacity to make choices, which\nthe child lacks. Second, what is done or not done in childhood can\naffect or shape the whole of one\u2019s later life and in a way that\nis largely irreversible. By contrast, an adult is in a better position\nto change the course of her life. Third, a child may be thought to\nhave the formal deliberative abilities to make choices (knowing what is\nto be decided) but simply lack the life experiences to appreciate and\nproperly understand those choices.\n\nFourth, in the specific case of an adolescent \u2013 who is legally a\nchild but on the edge of and at the beginning of adulthood \u2013\nthey may be judged as autonomous but nevertheless at a \u2018life\nstage\u2019 which merits paternalistic denial of choices\n(Franklin-Hall 2013).\n\nNow consider the case of a child who will not develop into an adult,\nsay someone who is suffering from a terminal disease that will prevent\nher living beyond the age of majority. Such a child lacks\ndevelopmental rights. Or rather, she has them, but her circumstances\ndo not allow for their protection. However, she does still have\nwelfare and protection rights whose correlate duties can be\ndischarged. The child has an interest in not suffering harm and in\nenjoying a certain standard of life even if she never lives beyond her\nchildhood.\n\nWhen, for instance, we provide a child with health care or protect her\nfrom abuse we not only thereby serve her immediate interests as a\nchild, but we also ensure that she will grow into a mentally and\nphysically healthy adult. At its simplest, a child\u2019s welfare\nright not to be killed is a precondition of the very possibility of\nthere being a future adult with any rights at all. Even the education\nof a child can be represented as not merely of instrumental worth to\nthe future adult but of value to the child here and now. A child has\nan interest now in learning things and does so independently of what\nthis might later mean for her future adult self. (Coady 1992, 51).\n\nThe child with the terminal illness will not develop into an adult.\nCan we say of anybody that she has an interest, as a child, in\ndeveloping into an adult, an interest that is frustrated by her\nterminal condition? Or is there an interest in only being a child and\nnever becoming an adult? Grant that the child-Q and the adult-Q are\ntwo stages of one and the same individual. Could we speak of a\nconflict between the present interest of child-Q in staying a child\nand the future interest of adult-Q in child-Q developing into her\nlater adult self? The latter interest seems perfectly straightforward.\nHowever, it is at least controversial whether everybody does have an\ninterest in growing up. Earlier cited work on the putative goods of\nchildhood can be used to argue that childhood as such has a value that\nadulthood does not, with the further questions arising of whether the\nformer value exceeds the latter and of whether they can be compared at\nall (Gheaus 2015; Hannan 2018). It has also been argued that it would\nbe better for human beings never to have been born (Benatar 2008).\nEven if this is not a general truth, it may be true of some humans\nthat not growing into adulthood and ceasing to exist is better than\nbecoming an adult. This might be true, for instance, of somebody\nfacing the prospect of a life of unrelieved, extreme pain and misery.\nCould there be an interest\u2014even without such a prospect\u2014in\nbeing forever a child?\n\nSuch an interest cannot be physically satisfied in this world. It\nis satisfied in the fictional world of Peter Pan; but the author of\nthat fantasy, J.M. Barrie, clearly deprecates his eponymous\nhero\u2019s infantile desire to escape the realities of the world\n(Barrie 1995).  If we only mean, by the imagined interest, remaining\nchildish it is hard to see how any individual in our world could, if\nrational, have such an interest. It is one thing to be a child forever\nin a child\u2019s world as Peter Pan is. It is quite another to\nremain a child in our adult world. Childhood is something best\nappreciated by the child. It is also something that needs to be left\nbehind. In the words of Paul, \u2018When I was a child, I spoke as a\nchild, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I\nbecame a man I put away these childish things\u2019 (I Corinthians\n13:11).\n",
