    "main_text": "Computation and representation\n5. Computation and representation\nPhilosophers and cognitive scientists use the term\n\u201crepresentation\u201d in diverse ways. Within philosophy, the\nmost dominant usage ties representation to intentionality, i.e., the\n\u201caboutness\u201d of mental states. Contemporary philosophers\nusually elucidate intentionality by invoking representational\ncontent. A representational mental state has a content that\nrepresents the world as being a certain way, so we can ask whether the\nworld is indeed that way. Thus, representationally contentful mental\nstates are semantically evaluable with respect to properties\nsuch as truth, accuracy, fulfillment, and so on. To illustrate:\n\n Beliefs are the sorts of things that can be true or false. My\nbelief that Emmanuel Macron is French is true if Emmanuel\nMacron is French, false if he is not.\n Perceptual states are the sorts of things that can be accurate or\ninaccurate. My perceptual experience as of a red sphere is\naccurate only if a red sphere is before me.\n Desires are the sorts of things that can fulfilled or\nthwarted. My desire to eat chocolate is fulfilled if I eat\nchocolate, thwarted if I do not eat chocolate.\n\nBeliefs have truth-conditions (conditions under which they are\ntrue), perceptual states have accuracy-conditions (conditions under\nwhich they are accurate), and desires have fulfillment-conditions\n(conditions under which they are fulfilled).\nIn ordinary life, we frequently predict and explain behavior by\ninvoking beliefs, desires, and other representationally contentful\nmental states. We identify these states through their representational\nproperties. When we say \u201cFrank believes that Emmanuel Macron is\nFrench\u201d, we specify the condition under which Frank\u2019s\nbelief is true (namely, that Emmanuel Macron is French). When we say\n\u201cFrank wants to eat chocolate\u201d, we specify the condition\nunder which Frank\u2019s desire is fulfilled (namely, that Frank eats\nchocolate). So folk psychology assigns a central role\nto intentional descriptions, i.e., descriptions that identify\nmental states through their representational properties. Whether\nscientific psychology should likewise employ intentional descriptions\nis a contested issue within contemporary philosophy of mind.\nIntentional realism is realism regarding\nrepresentation. At a minimum, this position holds that\nrepresentational properties are genuine aspects of mentality. Usually,\nit is also taken to hold that scientific psychology should freely\nemploy intentional descriptions when appropriate. Intentional realism\nis a popular position, advocated by Tyler Burge (2010a), Jerry Fodor\n(1987), Christopher Peacocke (1992, 1994), and many others. One\nprominent argument for intentional realism cites cognitive science\npractice. The argument maintains that intentional description\nfigures centrally in many core areas of cognitive science, such as\nperceptual psychology and linguistics. For example,\nperceptual psychology describes how perceptual activity transforms\nsensory inputs (e.g., retinal stimulations) into representations of\nthe distal environment (e.g., perceptual representations of distal\nshapes, sizes, and colors). The science identifies perceptual states\nby citing representational properties (e.g., representational\nrelations to specific distal shapes, sizes, colors). Assuming a\nbroadly scientific realist perspective, the explanatory achievements\nof perceptual psychology support a realist posture towards\nintentionality.\nEliminativism is a strong form of anti-realism about\nintentionality. Eliminativists dismiss intentional description as\nvague, context-sensitive, interest-relative, explanatorily\nsuperficial, or otherwise problematic. They recommend that scientific\npsychology jettison representational content. An early example is W.V.\nQuine\u2019s Word and Object (1960), which seeks to replace\nintentional psychology with behaviorist stimulus-response psychology.\nPaul Churchland (1981), another prominent eliminativist, wants to\nreplace intentional psychology with neuroscience.\nBetween intentional realism and eliminativism lie various\nintermediate positions. Daniel Dennett (1971, 1987) acknowledges that\nintentional discourse is predictively useful, but he questions whether\nmental states really have representational properties.\nAccording to Dennett, theorists who employ intentional descriptions\nare not literally asserting that mental states have\nrepresentational properties. They are merely adopting the\n\u201cintentional stance\u201d. Donald Davidson (1980) espouses a\nneighboring interpretivist position. He emphasizes the\ncentral role that intentional ascription plays within ordinary\ninterpretive practice, i.e., our practice of interpreting one\nanother\u2019s mental states and speech acts. At the same time, he\nquestions whether intentional psychology will find a place within\nmature scientific theorizing. Davidson and Dennett both profess\nrealism about intentional mental states. Nevertheless, both\nphilosophers are customarily read as intentional anti-realists. (In\nparticular, Dennett is frequently read as a kind\nof instrumentalist about intentionality.) One source of this\ncustomary reading involves indeterminacy of\ninterpretation. Suppose that behavioral evidence allows two\nconflicting interpretations of a thinker\u2019s mental states.\nFollowing Quine, Davidson and Dennett both say there is then \u201cno\nfact of the matter\u201d regarding which interpretation is correct.\nThis diagnosis indicates a less than fully realist attitude towards\nintentionality.\nDebates over intentionality figure prominently in philosophical\ndiscussion of CTM. Let us survey some highlights.\n",
