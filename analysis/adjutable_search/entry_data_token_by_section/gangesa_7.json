    "main_text": "Perception || Indeterminate cognition of a qualifier\n4.2 Indeterminate cognition of a qualifier\n\nThe idea of indeterminate perception is a latecomer in Ny\u0101ya\ntradition. Gautama, V\u0101tsy\u0101nana, and Uddyotakara, whose\nwritings form the core of the early school, do not recognize an\nindeterminate type of perception. The tenth-century author\nV\u0101caspati introduces the notion into the system (1996: 111).\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba is clearly aware of this history, for he opens his\ndiscussion by echoing V\u0101caspati's commentary on\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.4 where, in considering the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra\u2019s definition of perception,\nV\u0101caspati takes the two words\n\u2018avyapade\u015bya\u2019 (\u201cnon-verbal\u201d) and\n\u2018vyavas\u0101y\u00e2tmaka\u2019\n(\u201cdefinite\u201d) as indicating two types of perception,\nindeterminate and determinate. Udayana and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba follow\nhim, but there seems to have been some dissension among later\nNaiy\u0101yikas (Sibajiban Bhattacharyya 1990: 172\u20136).\n\nDeterminate perception, i.e., perceptual knowledge, is concept-laden,\na cognizing of a qualificandum through a qualifier. Things\nhave multiple properties some of which normally go undetected on any\ngiven occasion of experience. One can see Devadatta without seeing his\nback. Wholes are implicit in their parts, the very notion of which\nmakes no sense cut off from that of the whole: parts are parts of a\nwhole. If the ontological layering of things having qualifiers were\nnot reflected in a causal ordering of an indeterminate perception\nfeeding, so to say, the determinate, then perception of a\nqualificandum should entail that the \u201cthick\u201d particular be\npresented, i.e., the thing with all its properties, and, as\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba argues, a blind person in touching a yellow piece\nof cloth would know its color as yellow (2020: 359\u201360). The idea\nof indeterminate perception picking up just one or another feature of\nthings is thus tied to Ny\u0101ya realism. The idea historically,\nhowever, was taken over from Buddhists, it seems (Perrett: 2016).\n\nIn a thought experiment, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba imagines a child\nencountering a cow for the very first time (2020: 560). He argues that\nthe child can grasp the concept of cowhood and, had she the right\nwords, could say, correctly, \u201cThat\u2019s a cow,\u201d even\nthough she has had no previous experience of cows. The cowhood\npredication content is supplied by what is called\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d cognition of the qualifier, a first stage,\nso to say, of the sensory information flow. According to\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, such indeterminate cognition has to be positied to\nunderstand how we have, on the whole, workable concepts of things. The\nargument is that in a typical case of a first-time perceptual\nawareness of, for instance, a cow, there is a prior stage in the\ncausal process that is an indeterminate cognition, indeterminate in\nthat cowness is cognized but not as related to the particular cow, the\nqualificandum of the ensuing determinate perception. All other cases\nof cognition of an entity as qualified have a prior cognition of the\nqualifier as a causal factor. It is thus reasonable that the case of a\nfirst-time perception does as well. But since here clearly we do not\nhave a mental disposition (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) at work,\nindeterminate cognition has to be posited.\n\nSomething like indeterminate perception is posited by moderate\nfoundationalists in analytic epistemology as helping to solve the\nproblem of a justification regress, it seems (Phillips 2012: 50). A\nmental state not embedding an assertion and so immune to questions\nwhether it is true or false is proposed. BonJour (2003: 20): \u201c\n\u2026 such a state is, as it were, semi-assertive or\nsemi-judgmental in character: it has a kind of content or cognitive\nsignificance, but not in a way that would raise a further issue of\njustification.\u201d Such a comparison could be misleading, however.\nPerception, according to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, is a doxastic justifier.\nThe foundations of our worldly beliefs are doxastic in that\ndeterminate perceptions embed propositions that say at a minimum that\nsomething is some way or another. Concept-free perception may be\nthought of as Ny\u0101ya\u2019s way of rendering our ability to form\nconcepts merely from perception\u2019s phenomenological side. It is a\ntheoretical posit made to explain how our concepts originate in\nreality\u2014a problem that is epitomized in cases of a first-time\nperception of something as an F, the concept F-hood being previously\nunavailable to the perceiver.\n",
