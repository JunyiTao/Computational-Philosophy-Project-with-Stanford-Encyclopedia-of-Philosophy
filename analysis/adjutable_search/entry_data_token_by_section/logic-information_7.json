    "main_text": "Information as Correlation: Situation Theory || Distributed information systems and channel theory\n2.3 Distributed information systems and channel theory\n\nThe basic notion of information flow sketched in the previous section\ncan be lifted to a more abstract setting in which the supporters of\ninformation are not necessarily situations as concrete parts of the\nworld, but rather any entity which, as in the case of situations, can\nbe classified as being of or not of certain types. The mathematical\ntheory of distributed systems (Barwise and Seligman 1997) to be\ndescribed next takes this abstract approach by focusing on information\ntransfer within distributed systems in general.\n\nA model of a distributed system in this framework will actually be a\nmodel of a kind of distributed system. Accordingly, the model\nof the radar-airplane system that we will use as a running example\nhere will actually be a model of radar-airplane systems (in\nplural). Setting such a model requires describing the architecture of\nthe system in terms of its parts and the way they are put together\ninto a whole. Once that is done, one can proceed to see how that\narchitecture enables the flow of information among its parts.\n\nA part of a system (again, really its kind) is modelled by saying how\nparticular instances of it are classified according to a given set of\ntypes. In other words, for each part of a system one has a\nclassification \n\\[ \\mathbf{A} = \\langle Instances, Types, \\models \\rangle, \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\models\\) is a binary relation such that \\(a \\models T\\) if\nthe instance \\(a\\) is of type \\(T\\). In a simplistic analysis of the\nradar example, one could posit at least three classifications, one for\nthe monitor screen, one for the flying plane, and one for the whole\nmonitoring system:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{Screens} &= \\langle Monitor-Screens, Types\\: of\\: Screen\\: Configurations, \\models_M\\rangle \\\\\n \\mathbf{Planes} &= \\langle Flying\\: Planes, Types\\: of\\: Flying\\: Planes, \\models_P\\rangle \\\\\n \\mathbf{MonitSit} &= \\langle Monitoring\\: Situations, Types\\: of\\: Monitoring\\: Situations, \\models_M\\rangle \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nA general version of a \u2018part-of\u2019 relation between\nclassifications is needed in order to model the way parts of a system\nare assembled together. Consider the case of the monitoring systems.\nThat each one of them has a screen as one of its parts means that\nthere is a function that assigns to each instance of the\nclassification MonitSit an instance of\nScreens. On the other hand, all the ways in which a\nscreen can be classified (the types of Screens)\nintuitively correspond to ways in which the whole screening system\ncould be classified: if a screen is part of a monitoring system and\nthe screen is blinking, say, then the whole monitoring situation is\nintuitively one of the type \u2018its screen is blinking\u2019.\nAccordingly, a generalised \u2018part-of\u2019 relation between any\ntwo arbitrary classifications \\(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{C}\\) can be\nmodelled via two functions \n\\[\\begin{align}\nf^{\\wedge} &: \\textit{Types}_A \\rightarrow \\textit{Types}_C \\\\\n f^{\\vee} &: \\textit{Instances}_C \\rightarrow \\textit{Instances}_A, \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nthe first of which takes every type in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) to its\ncounterpart in \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), and the second of which takes every\ninstance \\(c\\) of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to its\n \\(\\mathbf{A}\\)-component.[5]\n\nIf \\(f : \\mathbf{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}\\) is shortcut notation for\nthe existence of the two functions above (the pair \\(f\\) of functions\nis called an infomorphism), then an arbitrary distributed\nsystem will consist of various classifications related by\ninfomorphisms. For our purposes, it will suffice here to consider\nthree classifications \\(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{C}\\) together\nwith two infomorphisms \n\\[\\begin{align}\nf &: \\mathbf{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C} \\\\\n g &: \\mathbf{B} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}. \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThen, in our example, a simple way to model the radar monitoring\nsystem would consist of the pair \n\\[\\begin{align}\nf &: \\mathbf{Screens} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{MonitSit} \\\\\n g &: \\mathbf{Planes} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{MonitSit}. \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe common codomain in these cases \\((\\mathbf{C}\\) in the general case\nand MonitSit in the example) works as a the core of a\nchannel that connects two parts of the system. The core\ndetermines the correlations that obtain between the two parts, thus\nenabling information flow of the kind discussed in\n section 2.2.\n This is achieved via two kinds of links. On the one hand, two\ninstances \\(a\\) from \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(b\\) from \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) can\nbe thought to be connected via the channel if they are components of\nthe same instance in \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), so the instances of\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) act as connections between components. Thus, in the\nradar example, a particular screen will be connected to a particular\nplane if they belong to the same monitoring situation.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose that every instance in \\(\\mathbf{C}\\)\nverifies some relation between types that happen to be counterparts of\ntypes from \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). Then such relation\ncaptures a constraint on how the parts of the system are\ncorrelated. In the radar example, the theory of the core\nclassification MonitSit would include constraints\nsuch as PlainMovingNorth \\(\\Rightarrow\\) DotGoingUp.\nThis regularity of monitoring\nsituations, which act as connections between radar screen-shots and\nplanes, reveals a way in which radar screens and monitored planes\ncorrelate with each other. All this leads to the following version of\ninformation transfer.\n\n\nChannel-enabled signalling: Suppose that\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf &: \\mathbf{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C} \\\\\n g &: \\mathbf{B} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}. \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThen instance \\(a\\) being of type \\(T\\) in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) indicates\nthat instance \\(b\\) is of type \\(T'\\) in \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) if \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) are connected by a instance from \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) and the relation\n\\(f^{\\wedge}(T) \\Rightarrow g^{\\wedge}(T')\\) between the counterpart\ninterpreted types is satisfied by all instances of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\).\n\n\nNow, for each classification \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), the collection\n\n\\[ L_A = \\{T \\Rightarrow T' \\mid \\text{ every instance of } \\mathbf{A} \\text{ of type } T \\text{ is also of type } T'\\} \\]\n\n\nformed by all the global constraints of the classification\ncan be thought of as a logic that is intrinsic to \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). Then\na distributed system consisting of various classifications and\ninfomorphisms will have a logic of constraints attached to each part\nof\n it,[6]\n and more sophisticated questions about information flow within the\nsystem can be formulated.\n\nFor example, suppose an infomorfism \\(f : \\mathbf{A} \\rightarrow\n\\mathbf{C}\\) is part of the distributed system under study. Then \\(f\\)\nnaturally transforms each global constraint \\(T \\Rightarrow T'\\) of\n\\(L_{\\mathbf{A}}\\) into \\(f^{\\wedge}(T) \\Rightarrow f^{\\wedge}(T')\\),\nwhich can always be shown to be an element of \\(L_{\\mathbf{C}}\\). This\nmeans that one can reason within \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and then\nreliably draw conclusions about \\(\\mathbf{C}\\). On the other\nhand, it can be shown that using preimages under \\(f^{\\wedge}\\) in\norder to translate global constraints of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) does\nnot always guarantee the result to be a global constraint of\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\). It is then desirable to identify extra conditions\nunder which the reliability of the inverse translation can be\nguaranteed, or at least improved. In a sense, these questions are\nqualitatively close to the concerns Shannon originally had about noise\nand reliability.\n\nAnother issue one may want to model is reasoning about a system from\nthe perspective of an agent that has only partial knowledge\nabout the parts of a system. As an example, think of a plane\ncontroller who has only worked with ACME monitors and knows nothing\nabout electronics. The logic such an agent might use to reason about\npart \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) of a system (actually part\nScreens in the case of the controller) will in\ngeneral consist of some constraints that may not even be global, but\nsatisfied only by some subset of instances (the ACME monitors). The\nagent\u2019s logic may be incomplete in the sense that it\nmight miss some of the global constraints of the classification (like\nthe ones involving inner components of the monitor). The agent\u2019s\nlogic may also be unsound, in the sense that there might be\ninstances out of the awareness of the agent (say monitors of\nunfamiliar brands) that falsify some of the agent\u2019s constraints\n(which do hold of all ACME monitors). A local logic \\(L\\) in\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\) can be \u201cmoved\u201d along an infomorphism \\(f :\n\\mathbf{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}\\) in the expected way, that is, its\nconstraints are transformed via \\(f^{\\wedge}\\), while its instances\nare transformed via \\(f^{\\vee}\\). Natural questions studied in channel\ntheory concerning these notions include the preservation (or not),\nunder translation, of some desirable properties of local logics, such\nas soundness.\n\nA recent development in channel theory (Seligman 2014) uses a more\ngeneral definition of local logic, in which not all instances in the\nlogic need to satisfy all its constraints. This version of channel\ntheory is put to use in two important ways. Firstly, by using local\nlogics to stand for situations, and with a natural interpretation of\nwhat an infon should then be, a reconstruction is produced of the core\nmachinery of situation theory (barely presented in\n sections 2.1\n and\n section 2.2).\n Secondly, it is shown that this version of channel theory can deal\nwith probabilistic constraints. The rough idea is that any\npair of a classification plus a probability measure over the set of\ninstances induces an extended classification with the same set of\ntypes, and where a constraint holds if and only if the set of\ncounterexample instances has measure 0. Notice that this set of\ncounterexamples might not be empty. Having probabilistic constraints\nis a crucial step towards the effort of formally relating channel\ntheory to Shannon\u2019s theory of communication.\n\nFor an extensive development of the theory of channels sketched here,\nplus several explorations towards applications, see Barwise and\nSeligman (1997). See van Benthem (2000) for a study of conditions\nunder which constraint satisfiability is preserved under\ninfomorphisms, and Allo (2009) for an application of this framework to\nan analysis of the distinction between cognitive states and\ncognitive commodities. Finally, it must be mentioned that the\nnotion of classification has been around for some years now in the\nliterature, having being independently studied and introduced under\nnames such as Chu spaces (Pratt 1995) or Formal Contexts (Ganter and\nWille 1999).\n",
