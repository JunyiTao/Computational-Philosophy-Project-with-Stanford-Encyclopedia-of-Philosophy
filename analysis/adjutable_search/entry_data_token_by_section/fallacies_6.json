    "main_text": "History of Fallacy Theory || Bentham\n2.6 Bentham\n\nJeremy Bentham\u2019s Handbook of Political Fallacies (1824)\nwas written in the years leading up to the first Reform Bill (1832).\nHis interest was in political argumentation, particularly in exposing\nthe different means used by parliamentarians and law makers to defeat\nor delay reform legislation. Hence, it was not philosophy or science\nthat interested him, but political debate. Fallacies he took to be\narguments or topics that would through the use of deception produce\nerroneous beliefs in people (1824, 3). These tactics he (or his\neditor) divided into four classes: fallacies of authority, danger,\ndelay and confusion. Bentham was aware of the developing\nad-fallacies tradition since each of the thirty or so\nfallacies he described is also labelled as belonging either to the\nkind ad verecundiam (appeal to shame or modesty), ad\nodium (appeal to hate or contempt),  ad metum (appeal to\nfear or threats), ad quietem (appeal to rest or inaction),\nad judicium, and ad socordiam (appeal to\npostponement or delay). Most of Bentham\u2019s fallacies have not\nbecome staples of fallacy theory but many of them show interesting\ninsights into the motives and techniques of debaters (see e.g.,\nRudanko\u2019s (2005, 2009) analyses of the ad\nsocordiam).\n\nBentham\u2019s Handbook has not taken a central place in the\nhistory of fallacy studies (Hamblin 1970, 165\u201369); nevertheless,\nit is historically interesting in several respects. It discusses\nauthority at length, identifying four conditions for reliable appeals\nto authority and maintaining that the failure of any one of them\ncancels the strength of the appeal. Fallacies of authority in\npolitical debate occur when authority \u201cis employed in the place\nof such relevant arguments as might have been brought forward\u201d\n(1824, 25). Bentham\u2019s fear is that debaters will resort to\n\u201cthe authority\u201d of traditional beliefs and principles\ninstead of considering the advantages of the reform measures under\ndiscussion.\n\nUnder the heading \u201cfallacies of danger\u201d Bentham named a\nnumber of what he called vituperative fallacies\u2014imputations of\nbad character, bad motive, inconsistency, and suspicious\nconnections\u2014which have as their common characteristic,\n\u201cthe endeavour to draw aside attention from the measure\nto the man, in such a way as to cause the latter\u2019s\nbadness to be imputed to the measure he supports, or his goodness to\nhis opposition\u201d (1824, 83). This characterization fits well with\nthe way we have come to think of the ad hominem fallacy as a\nview disparaged by putting forth a negative characterization of its\nsupporter or his circumstances.\n\nBentham places the fallacies in the immediate context of debate,\nidentifying ways in which arguers frustrate the eventual resolution of\ndisagreements by using insinuations of danger, delaying tactics,\nappeals to questionable authorities and, generally, confusing issues.\nModern argumentation theorists who hold that any impediment to the\nsuccessful completion of dialogical discussions is a fallacy, may find\nthat their most immediate precursor was Bentham (see Grootendorst\n1997).\n",
