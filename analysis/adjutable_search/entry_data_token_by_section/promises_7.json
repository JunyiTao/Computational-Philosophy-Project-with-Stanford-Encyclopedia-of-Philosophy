    "main_text": "Conventionalism || Hybrid Theories\n2.3 Hybrid Theories\n\nBy the late twentieth century, outside of the legal academy, this sort\nof dual conventionalism was the dominant view among theorists who took\nup these issues. Thomas Scanlon\u2019s influential work propounding\nan expectational view of promises, takes this tradition as its\ntarget.\n\nIn \u201cPromises and Practices\u201d (1990), Scanlon argued that\n(among other things) the conventional view gets the harm of breaking a\npromise wrong. On the conventional view, when someone breaks a\npromise, they harm the convention of promising as a whole, and by\nextension, all those who rely on it. But this clashes with our firm\nintuition that a broken promise harms primarily the jilted\npromisee.\n\nOne possible response to this open to a conventionalist is to move\ntowards a \u201chybrid\u201d theory, one that invokes the convention\nto explain the source of the trust of the promisee, but explains the\nharm done in breaking a promise (and thus the ground of the obligation\nto keep one) as one of betraying that trust as per the expectational\nview\n\nThis is roughly the route that Kolodny and Wallace take in their\nproposal for an expectational/conventional hybrid sort of theory in\nresponse to Scanlon, in a piece called \u201cPromises and Practices\nRevisited\u201d (2003). They argue there that the two different sorts\nof principles would satisfy two different demands\u2014the appeal to\nthe convention would explain the moral obligation, while the appeal to\nexpectations would account for the directed wrongness of\npromise-breaking.\n\nWe can understand this move as a conscious return to the bifurcated\nconventionalism of Hobbes and Hume, save in this case the view is\nontologically conventional, but normatively expectational, as opposed\nto a natural law/normative power hybrid of Hobbes.\n\nThis hybrid proposal, and the criticisms that prompted it, have also\nspawned a growing discussion among theorists (see Cureton 2015;\nShockley 2008; Roth 2016; van Roojen 2013; and Melenovsky 2017, among\nothers).\n",
