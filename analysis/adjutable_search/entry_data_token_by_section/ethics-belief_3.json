The main distinction here is between\nhypothetical and categorical structure.\n\nPrudential norms usually have a hypothetical structure: if\nyou have prudential reason to survive the disease, and if\nbelieving that you are going to do so will help you achieve this end,\nthen you have a prima facie obligation to believe that you\nare going to survive. Likewise, if you want to protect your\nrelationship with your son, and if believing that he is\ndeceiving you and taking drugs will damage your ability to trust him,\nthen you are prima facie obliged to withhold that belief.\n\nPut more generally: if you have a prudential end E, and\nbelief that p is likely to make E obtain, then you\nhave a prima facie obligation to believe that p. The\nobligation will be particularly powerful (though still prima\nfacie) if E cannot be achieved other than through belief\nthat p, and if you are (or should be) aware of that fact.\n(For more on hypothetical norms generally, see Broome 1999 and\nSchroeder 2005)\n\nThe structure of moral and epistemic norms can also be construed\nhypothetically in this way. The ends in question will presumably be\ndoing the morally right thing or promoting the moral\ngood, on the one hand, and acquiring significant\nknowledge or minimizing significant false belief, on the\nother (see Foley 1987). Achieving these ends clearly does involve an\nincrease in well-being on most conceptions of the latter.\n\nHowever, because these ends are putatively set for us not by a\ncontingent act of will but rather by our nature as morally engaged,\nknowledge-seeking beings, some philosophers regard them as\ncategorical rather than instrumental imperatives. In other\nwords, they take these norms to say not merely that if we\nwant to achieve various hypothetical ends, then we have the\nprima facie obligation to believe in such-and-such ways.\nRather, the norms say that we do have these ends as a matter\nof natural or moral necessity, and thus that we prima facie\nought to believe in such-and-such ways.\n\nNote, however, that the most general prudential end\u2014something\nlike surviving, say\u2014may be thought to have an equal\nclaim to the title of a \u201cnecessary\u201d end: it is set for us\nby our nature as living members of a species that has evolved through\nnatural selection. And so by the same logic it might be taken to\nunderwrite a categorical\u2014albeit still prudential\u2014norm of\nbelief, especially in life-or-death cases such as that of the cancer\ndiagnosis above.\n",
