Arguments for Compositionality\n\nThe simplest argument for compositionality is that it is supported by\nintuitions many claim to have about meaning and structure. Although\nthere are interesting putative counterexamples (see\n section 4.2)\n they probably can be explained away through modest revisions of our\nsyntactic and/or semantic theories. This defense is reasonable but\nmuch too modest. For even if it succeeds in convincing some who\naren\u2019t already convinced, it leaves us all in the dark\nwhy compositionality is true. Defenders of compositionality\nshould do better than this.\n",
