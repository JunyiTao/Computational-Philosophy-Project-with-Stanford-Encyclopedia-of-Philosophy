    "main_text": "Varieties of Pacifism\n2. Varieties of Pacifism\n\nPacifism includes a wide variety of ideas and commitments. Pacifism\nhas typically been understood as a critical or negative argument\nagainst war (or violence), even though Fiala has argued that pacifism\ncould be understood as a comprehensive normative theory that\npostulates peace as the highest good (Fiala 2018a). Pacifism in its\nbroadest sense can be distinguished from application of pacifist\ncritique to particular issues such as: domestic violence (Hall\nFitzgibbon 2017), environmental issues (Woods 2017), the death penalty\n(Steffen 2017), nonhuman animals (Chapple 2017), and so on. This\narticle will not focus on those applications. Rather, it organizes the\nvariety of pacifisms in several ways according to interrelated\nconceptual distinctions: absolute and contingent pacifism; maximal and\nminimal pacifism; universal vs. particular pacifism. These\ndistinctions overlap, as we shall see here.\n",
