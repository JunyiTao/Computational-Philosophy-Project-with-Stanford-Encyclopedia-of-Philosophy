    "main_text": "Proportionality || Proportionality and Modes of Agency\n3.3 Proportionality and Modes of Agency\nIn addition to the questions of who is harmed and how much, it has also been suggested that proportionality judgments are sensitive to also the way in which harm is brought about (the \u201cmode of agency\u201d). For example, non-consequentialists typically endorse at least some of the following claims:\n\nCausing harm is harder to justify than allowing harm to occur.\nIntentionally causing harm is harder to justify than causing harm as an unintended side-effect.\nHarming a person in a way that uses that person as a means is harder to justify than harming a person in way that does not use them as a means.\nDirectly causing harm is harder to justify than enabling other people to cause harm.\nCausing harm is harder to justify than preventing harm from being prevented.\n\nIf any of these moral asymmetries are plausible, then it seems natural to weight them in proportionality assessments (Rodin, 2011; McMahan 2014b). On this view, it may be proportionate to cause harm via one mode of agency, but disproportionate to cause an identical level of harm to the same person(s) via a different mode.\nOne interesting question is whether modes of agency apply differently in assessments of narrow and wide proportionality. For example, one might hold that if a person is liable to a harm, then it is morally irrelevant how that harm is brought about. Alternatively, we might think that narrow proportionality assessments should be sensitive to at least some of these moral distinctions. For example, it might be argued that an agent is liable to a certain level of harm that prevents them from posing a threat, but is liable to a lesser harm that involves using her as a means (McMahan 2009: 219\u2013221). On this view, persons are not liable simply to a certain level of harm, but rather to a certain level of harm brought about in a certain way (Gordon-Solmon 2019).\n",
