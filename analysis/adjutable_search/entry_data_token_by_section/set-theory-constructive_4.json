    "main_text": "Origins of Constructive and Intuitionistic Set Theories\n2. Origins of Constructive and Intuitionistic Set Theories\n\n\nIntuitionistic versions of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theories were\nintroduced in the early 1970s by Friedman and Myhill. In (Friedman\n1973) the author presents a study of formal properties of various\nintuitionistic systems and introduces for them an extension of\nKleene\u2019s realisability method. The realisability technique is applied\nin (Myhill 1973) to show the existence property for a version of\nintuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (with replacement in place\nof collection). In another fundamental contribution Friedman extends\nthe double negation translation of intuitonistic logic to relate\nclassical and intuitionistic set theories (Friedman 1973a). These\nfirst papers already address the relation between some major\nintuitionistic set theories and classical ZF. They also clarify a key\nfeature of set theory based on intuitionistic logic, mainly that it is\namenable to powerful constructive semantic interpretations, like\nrealizability. These techniques are applied to the study of crucial\nmetatheoretical properties which are typical of the constructive\napproach and which are enjoyed by some constructive set theories (see\nthe section on\n Semantic techniques). \nThis groundbreaking work has been fully exploited and substantially\nextended in work by Beeson and McCarty (see Beeson 1985; McCarty\n1984).\n\n\nConstructive set theory from the very start has a more distinctive\nfoundational vocation and it is bound up with Bishop\u2019s mathematics. In\nfact, in 1967 Bishop published the book \u201cFoundations of\nconstructive analysis\u201d (Bishop 1967), which opened up a new era\nfor mathematics based on intuitionistic logic (see the entry on\n constructive mathematics).\nThe monograph stimulated fresh attempts in the logical community to\nclarify and formally represent the principles which were used by\nBishop, though only at an informal level. First attempts by Goodman\nand Myhill (Goodman and Myhill 1972) made use of versions of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s system T (see also (Bishop 1970) for a similar\nattempt). Myhill, however, reached the conclusion that the resulting\nformalisation was too complex and artificial (Myhill 1975,\n347). Myhill proposed instead a system which is closer to the informal\nnotion of set originally utilised by Bishop and also closer to the\nset-theoretic tradition. Myhill writes (1975, 347):\nWe refuse to believe that things have to be this complicated -\nthe argumentation of (Bishop 1967) looks very smooth and seems to \nfall directly from a certain concept of what sets, functions, etc. are, and\nwe wish to discover a formalism which isolates the principles underlying \nthis conception in the same way that Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\nisolates the principles underlying classical (nonconstructive)\nmathematics. We want these principles to be such as to make the\nprocess of formalization completely trivial, as it is in the classical\ncase.\n\n\nWe observe here that Myhill\u2019s constructive set theory had\ndistinguished notions of function, natural number and set; it thus\nclosely represented a constructive tradition in which functions and\nnatural numbers are conceptually independent from sets. Another\nfundamental step in the development of constructive set theory was\nFriedman\u2019s \u201cSet-theoretical foundations for constructive\nanalysis\u201d (Friedman 1977). Here, among other systems, a system\ncalled B is defined which has further restrictions on the\nset-theoretic principles compared with Myhill\u2019s (in particular, it has\nno set induction). It also has a restricted form of the axiom of\ndependent choice. System B is there shown to be expressive enough to\nrepresent the constructive analysis of Bishop (1967) whilst being at\nthe same time proof-theoretically very weak (due to the absence of set\ninduction). System B is in fact a conservative extension of\narithmetic (thus it is well below the limit of predicativity given the natural numbers\nbriefly recalled in section\n 1.3).\n Myhill and Friedman\u2019s systems were\nsubsequently modified by Aczel, to obtain a system, CZF (Constructive\nZermelo-Fraenkel), that is fully compatible with the ZF language\n(Aczel 1978, 1982, 1986; Aczel and Rathjen 2001; 2010). CZF also\nincluded no choice principles. Aczel gave an interpretation of CZF in\nMartin-L\u00f6f type theory with the aim of corroborating the\nconstructive nature of the set theory. He also strengthened some of\nthe principles of Myhill\u2019s system (namely, collection and\nexponentiation) on the ground that the stronger versions are still\nvalidated by the interpretation in type theory.\n\n\nOther foundational systems for\nBishop-style constructive mathematics were introduced in the early\n1970\u2019s. For example: explicit mathematics by S. Feferman\n(Feferman 1975), and the already mentioned Intuitionistic Type\nTheory (Martin-L\u00f6f 1975; 1984). \nConstructive type theory is usually considered the \nmost satisfactory foundation for constructive mathematics Bishop-style. \nBoth type theory and explicit mathematics can be seen as expressing \nmore directly the computational \ncontent of constructive mathematics. Type theory, in particular, \ncan be read as a very general and expressive programming language. \nConstructive and intuitionistic set\ntheories display their computational\ncontent only indirectly through their semantic interpretations\n(see e.g. (Aczel 1977), (Lipton 1995) and the section on\n Semantic techniques).\n",
