    "main_text": "The Harm Principle and Free Speech || Responses to the Harm Principle\n2.4 Responses to the Harm Principle\n\nThere are two basic responses to the harm principle. One is that it is\ntoo narrow; the other is that it is too broad. This latter view is not\noften expressed because, as already noted, most people think that free\nspeech should be limited if it causes illegitimate harm. George Kateb\n(1996), however, has made an interesting argument that runs as\nfollows. If we want to limit speech because it causes harm, we will\nhave to ban a lot of political speech. Most of it is useless, a lot of\nit is offensive, and some of it causes harm because it is deceitful\nand aimed at discrediting specific groups. It also undermines\ndemocratic citizenship and stirs up nationalism and jingoism, which\nresults in harm to citizens of other countries. Even worse than\npolitical speech, according to Kateb, is religious speech. He claims\nthat a lot of religious speech is hateful, useless, dishonest, and\nfoments war, bigotry and fundamentalism. It also creates bad\nself-image and feelings of guilt that can haunt persons throughout\ntheir lives. Pornography and hate speech, he claims, cause nowhere\nnear as much harm as political and religious speech. As we rightly do\nnot want to ban political and religious speech, Kateb claims to have\ndemonstrated that the harm principle casts the net too far. His\nsolution is to abandon the principle in favor of almost unlimited\nspeech.\n\nThis is a powerful argument, but there seem to be at least two\nproblems. The first is that the harm principle would actually allow\nreligious and political speech for the same reasons that it allows\nmost pornography and hate speech, namely that it is not possible to\ndemonstrate that such speech does cause direct harm to rights. I doubt\nthat Mill would support using his arguments about harm to ban\npolitical and religious speech. The second problem for Kateb is that\nif he is right that such speech does cause harm by violating rights,\nwe now have powerful reasons for limiting political and religious\nspeech. If Kateb's argument is sound he has shown that harm is more\nextensive than we might have thought; he has not demonstrated that the\nharm principle is invalid.\n",
