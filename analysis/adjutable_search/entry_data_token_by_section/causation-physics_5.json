    "main_text": "(Neo)-Russellian Challenges || The Determinism Challenge\n2.3 The Determinism Challenge\n\nCauses are often taken to act deterministically in accord with the\nprinciple \u201csame cause\u2014same effect\u201d. Indeed, that\ncauses determine their effects is built into many philosophical\naccounts of causation, such as Hume\u2019s regularity account. We\nhave already seen that the demand that causes determine their effects\nputs pressure on the idea that paradigmatic causal claims relate a\nsmall number of localized events to one another. But even considered\non its own the association between determinism and causation can be\nmarshalled in support of an anti-causal argument.\n\nOne version of the determinism challenge proceeds from the following\ntwo premises. First, according to the most promising accounts of\ncausation, causes act deterministically: a complete set of causes\ndetermines its effects. Second, mature theories of physics are not\ndeterministic. From these premises the argument concludes that\ncause-effect relations cannot be part of our mature theories of\nphysics.\n\nNorton presents the determinism challenge as part of a more general\nchallenge that any defender of causal notions in physics faces, which\nhe puts in terms of the following dilemma:\n\n\nEITHER conforming a science to cause and effect places a restriction\non the factual content of a science; OR it does not. [\u2026] In the\nfirst horn, we must find some restriction on factual content that can\nbe properly applied to all sciences; but no appropriate restriction is\nforthcoming. In the second horn, since the imposition of the causal\nframework makes no difference to the factual content of the sciences,\nit is revealed as an empty honorific. (2003: 3\u20134)\n\n\nFor causal notions to play a legitimate role in physics, Norton claims\nthey must do so as part of an acceptable \u201cprinciple of\ncausality\u201d that provides a universal constraint on all physical\ntheories. What form might such a principle take? The physicist Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger proposed a causal principle that combines some of the\noptions canvased by Norton\u2014determinism, locality, and temporal\nasymmetry:\n\n\nthe exact situation at any point P at a given moment is\nunambiguously determined by the exact physical situation within a\ncertain surrounding of P at any previous time, say \\(t -\n\\tau.\\) (Schr\u00f6dinger 1951: 28).\n\n\nIt follows from the existence of successful physical theories that\nviolate the principle either that we have yet to find the\ncorrect principle of causality or that there is no such\nprinciple that constitutes a universal causal constraint. This, Norton\nargues, entails that \u201cthe notion of cause is dispensable\u201d\n(Norton 2003: 8).\n\nThat a principle of determinism is violated in physics receives\nsupport from quantum mechanics\u2014or at least from any\ninterpretation according to which the theory is indeterministic. Yet\nif quantum mechanics were cited as reason for the failure of a\nprinciple of causality, one can try to rescue the principle by\nintroducing a notion of probabilistic causation: causes do not\ndetermine their effects but determine the probabilities of an\neffect\u2019s occurrence. Here, too, Schr\u00f6dinger can serve as\nexample, who later maintained that\n\n\nwhat do change [in the evolution of a quantum state and as a result of\nquantum measurements are] the probabilities; these, moreover,\ncausally. (Schr\u00f6dinger 1935: 809; quoted in Ben-Menahem 2018:\n92)\n\n\nPartly motivated by the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics,\nphilosophers have developed probabilistic accounts of causation\n(Suppes 1970), according to which the presence of a causes raises (or\nat least changes) the probabilities of its effects.\n\nNorton (2003) argues that this defense is unsuccessful, since\ndeterminism comes under pressure even in what is often taken to be the\nparadigm of a deterministic theory, Newtonian physics. Norton\u2019s\nexample of an non-deterministic Newtonian system is that of a mass,\nsubject only to gravitational force, initially at rest sitting at the\napex of a dome whose height h depends on the its radius\nr according to \\(h=(2/3g)r^{3/2}.\\) Norton shows that this\nsystem has an infinity of solutions, each corresponding to the mass\nsliding down the dome in some arbitrary radial direction \\(\\cdot\\) at\nsome arbitrary time T. Hence the system is indeterministic and\nfor each particular solution there is nothing to which we can point as\nthe cause of the mass\u2019s beginning to slide down the dome in\ndirection \\(\\cdot\\) at time T.\n\nIt is unclear, however, whether examples such as this do indeed show\nthat Newtonian mechanics is indeterministic. The force acting on the\nmass, which is given by \\(F=r^{1/2},\\) does not satisfy a continuity\ncondition for \\(r=0\\)\u2014the so-called Lipschitz\ncondition. According to the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem, the\nLipschitz continuity condition (which, intuitively, restricts how fast\na function can change) is a sufficient condition for the initial value\nproblem to have a unique solution\u2014that is, for the system at\nissue to behave deterministically (\u201cCauchy-Lipschitz\ntheorem\u201d in\n Other Internet References).\n And one can argue that conditions constraining the allowable force\nfunctions in Newton\u2019s law, such as the Lipschitz condition, are\nan integral part of the content of Newtonian physics. Thus, whether we\ntake Newtonian physics to be deterministic depends on what we take the\ncontent of the theory to be. If what counts as a Newtonian system is\nnot given by Newton\u2019s laws alone but depends on additional\nconditions, including the Lipschitz condition, then the theory is\ndeterministic after all (Fletcher 2012). If the content of the theory\nis given merely by the conjunction of Newton\u2019s laws without\nadditional constraints on allowable force functions, then\nNorton\u2019s example shows that the theory is not deterministic.\n\nThe determinism challenge can be raised as part of each of the three\nphilosophical projects we distinguished: one might argue that our\nintuitive concept of cause is deterministic or that only a\ndeterministic concept of cause could serve fulfil certain useful\ncognitive functions. But Norton\u2019s dilemma that a causal\nconstraint either has to place a constraint on all\nsciences\u2014that is, is a universal constraint\u2014or\nwould amount to a mere honorific is perhaps most easily resisted\nwithin the functional project. As Woodward (2014) emphasizes, it is\ncompatible with causal judgments playing an important cognitive role\nin some domains that there are limits to the scope of causal thinking\nand that causal concepts are not universally applicable. Thus, the\nusefulness of deterministic causal reasoning might be restricted to\nsome contexts\u2014contexts that may include some theoretical\ncontexts in physics\u2014while there may also be domains in physics\nin which deterministic causal notions are not applicable. Norton\nassumes that a constraint that is not universal is no constraint at\nall, but this assumption can be\n denied.\n\nNorton\u2019s demand that any causal principle needs to be a\nuniversal principle may be on a stronger footing within the\nmetaphysical project and in fact Norton himself calls his argument\n\u201cthe fundamentalist\u2019s dilemma\u201d: If a metaphysical\naccount of causation is committed to the principle \u201csame\ncause\u2013same effect\u201d or even just to a probabilistic version\nof this principle, then the existence of genuine indeterminism in\nphysics of the kind discussed by Norton would pose a serious threat to\nthat account. \n",
