    "main_text": "Replies to Bradleyean Arguments || The Brute Fact Approach\n3.5 The Brute Fact Approach\n\nThe term \u201cbrute fact approach\u201d is slightly ambiguous. It\ncan be identified with the rejectionist view sketched along the lines\nof 3.1 above, where to say that relations\u2019 job is to relate is\nto take that fact about relations as primitive or \u201cbrute\u201d.\nHowever, the expression, as it is used here, is intended to refer to\nthe view that takes complexes such as states of affairs or facts as\nunifiers of their own constituents. This view was defended by Olson\n(1987) and Armstrong (1989, 1997), and challenged by Vallicella\n(2000).\n\nOlson finds that the upshot of Bradley\u2019s arguments was not so\nmuch a reductio of relations, but to show that facts should\nbe taken as irreducible entities. The word \u201crelation\u201d, for\nOlson, is ambiguous between two senses: the first one is to designate\nan entity that can be multiply instantiated by various pairs of\nrelata, whereas the second sense is to designate the fact of\nrelatedness. In place of \u201crelation\u201d, Olson prefers the\nword \u201cconnection\u201d, since it \u201ccan only mean being\nconnected. There is not the same temptation to think of it as an\nadditional thing that does the connecting.  The connection is\nnot a constituent of the fact; it is the fact itself\u201d (Olson\n1987: 61).  Armstrong seems to have something similar to this in mind\nwhen he says that states of affairs \u201ccome first\u201d. But then\nhe also adds that they \u201chold their constituents\ntogether in a non-mereological form of composition, a form of\ncomposition that even allows the possibility of having different\nstates of affairs with identical constituents\u201d (Armstrong 1997:\n118, italics added).\n\nVallicella (2002) has objected to this sort of brute fact approach\nthat it is mysterious and incoherent. He even accuses the proponents\nof the brute fact approach as being committed to the following\ncontradiction: \n\n\nIt is self-evident that a fact, being a complex, is composed of its\nconstituents and is thus nothing more than them. But it is also\nself-evident that a fact, being the unity of its constituents, is more\nthan its constituents. Faced with this contradiction, we must either\ndeny the existence of facts altogether [\u2026] or look beyond facts\nto something that can remove the contradiction. (Vallicella 2002:\n20\u201321) \n\n\nThis objection, of course, presupposes that the only non-controversial\nform of composition is the mereological kind and that facts are\n\u201cnothing more than their constituents\u201d. Armstrong\u2019s\nand Olson\u2019s facts openly go against these assumptions: they are\nunities that are more than just the sum of their constituents. But\nfailing to provide further ground for the difference between the sum\nand the fact makes such facts brute and unacceptable to\nVallicella.\n 3.6 Benign Infinitism\n\nIn the context of discussion of states of affairs as unifiers of their\nconstituents, Armstrong anticipated Vallicella\u2019s objection just\ndescribed. His reply was to claim that even if he had to concede that\nit was necessary to introduce a relation or a \u201cfundamental\ntie\u201d to account for the peculiar unity present in states of\naffairs, the resulting regress would not be vicious. In fact, such a\nregress would be closer to the benign truth regress\u2014many truths,\nbut only one truthmaker, just like with \u201cp\u201d, and \u201cit\nis true that p\u201d, and \u201cit is true that it is true that\np\u201d, etc. Treating the instantiation regress in the same way, we\nwould have the first instantiation relation uniting the constituents\nof the state of affairs, but all further relations would supervene and\nnot present any further ontological addition.\n\nOrilia (2006, 2007) develops this sort of response a bit further. He\nagrees with Armstrong (1997) that Bradley\u2019s regress is an\nexplanatory regress that is, in fact, benign. What makes it benign for\nOrilia is that at each step of an explanation the added fact explains\nthe previous one via an additional external relation. He\nargues that despite it being the case \u201cthat at any given stage\nwe can continue the explanatory task\u201d, it \u201cdoes\nnot show that no knowledge or no understanding is provided at any\nstage\u201d. According to Orilia, this \u201cmerely shows that at no stage we know/understand everything that there\nis to know/understand about the explicandum that gives rise\nto the expalantory chain. And noting that the explicandum in\nquestion gives rise to such an infinite chain may be considered part\nof our understanding of it\u201d (Orilia 2007: 160).\n\nEven if one were to grant Orilia that there can be infinite dependence\nchains of facts, for Maurin (2015) a crucial problem remains\nunresolved. According to her, Orilia\u2019s account does nothing to\nanswer what she calls the \u201chow\u201d question, i.e., the\nquestion \u201chow can there be a situation in which the\nstate of affairs that a is F exists?\u201d. She argues that\nthe infinitist\u2019s reply already presupposes that there\nis unity of states of affairs before explaining what its\nexistence depends upon\u2014that is, a further state of affairs, etc.\nBut the all important \u201chow\u201d question, according to Maurin,\nremains unanswered.\n",
