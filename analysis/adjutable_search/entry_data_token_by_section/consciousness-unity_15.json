    "main_text": "Two Philosophical Questions || Partial Unity is Possible\n6.2 Partial Unity is Possible\n\nThe \u2018in some respects one, in some respects two\u2019\npossibility at the centre of Nagel\u2019s analysis is related to a\nquestion about transitivity. Is it possible, for a given instance of\nexperienced objects p, q, and r, for there to be\nunified consciousness of p and q, unified consciousness\nof q and r, but no unified consciousness of p and\nr? (The parallel in brain bisection cases? Call the\n\u2018centres of consciousness\u2019 in the two cerebral lobes\nA and C, the older unilateral brain below them B.\nIs it possible for a mental state in A to be unified in\nconsciousness with one in B, one in B with one in\nC, and yet the state in A not to be unified with the\nstate in C?) \n\nHurley (1998) examines this question in detail, as does Bayne (2010:\nch. 9.4). Hurley comes at the question of transitivity by considering\nsome results reported by Sergent (1990). Since Sergent\u2019s work\nhas not been replicable, let us look instead at how the research by\nTrevarthen that we mentioned in\n Section 4.1.6\n throws up the same issue. In this research, as we said, brain\nbisection patients under certain conditions are conscious of some\nobject seen by, say, the right hemisphere until the left hand, which\nis controlled by the right hemisphere, reaches for it. Somehow the act\nof reaching for it seems to obliterate the consciousness of it. Very\nstrange\u2014how can something pop into and disappear from unified\nconsciousness in this way? This question leads Hurley to the notion of\npartial unity. Could two centres of consciousness, A\nand C, though not unified in consciousness with one another,\nnonetheless both be unified with some third thing, in this case the\nvolitional system B (the system of intentions, desires, etc.)?\nIf so, \u2018being unified with\u2019 is not a transitive\nrelationship\u2014A could be unified with B, and\nC could be unified with B, without A being\nunified with C. This idea is puzzling enough. Even more\npuzzling is how activation of the system B, with which both\nA and C are unified, could result in the loss of\nconsciousness in A and/or C of an object aimed at by\nB.\n\nHurley never pronounces on the possibility of partial unity. Instead,\nshe argues that none of the cases suspected of displaying it really\ndo. She accepts that intention can obliterate consciousness\u2014but\nthen distinguishes time periods (1998: 216). In Trevarthen\u2019s\ncases, for example, the situation with respect to unity is clear at\nany given moment\u2014one either is or is not conscious of the\nobject. The picture over time does not conform to our usual\nexpectations for diachronic singularity or transitivity of\nunity\u2014but that is simply an artefact of the cases, not a\nproblem. \n\nHurley considers another class of cases, what she calls Marcel\u2019s\n(1994) cases. Here subjects are asked to report the appearance of some\nitem in consciousness in three ways at the same time\u2014say, by\nblinking, pushing a button, and saying, \u2018I see it\u2019.\nRemarkably, in different trials each of these three acts are done\nwithout doing the other two. And the question is, What does this imply\nfor unified consciousness? In a case in which the subject pushes the\nbutton but neither blinks nor says anything, for example, is the\nhand-controller aware of the object while the blink-controller and the\nspeech-controller are not? How could the conscious system become\nfragmented in such a way?\n\nHurley\u2019s suggestion? They can\u2019t. What induces the\nappearance of incoherence about unity is the short time scale. Suppose\nthat it takes some time to achieve unified consciousness, perhaps\nbecause some complex feedback processes are involved. If so, then\nMarcel\u2019s cases have not got to a stable situation with respect\nto unity. The subjects were not given enough time (1998: 216).\n\nIs partial unity possible? To date, this remains an unanswered\nquestion, though Bayne (2010: 209) leans towards a negative\nanswer.\n\nHurley discusses more aspects of the unity of consciousness than\npartial unity. She argues, for example, that there is a normative\ndimension to unified consciousness\u2014conscious states have to\ncohere semantically for unified consciousness to result (we will\nreturn to this issue in\n Section 7.3).\n She discusses most of the kinds of breakdown phenomena that we\nconsidered earlier, exploring the implications of a wide range of\n\u2018experiments of nature\u2019 and laboratory experiments for the\npresence or absence of unified consciousness. In particular, she\nconsiders acallosal people (people born without a corpus callosum).\nEven though the corpus callosum, when present, is the chief channel of\ncommunication between the hemispheres, acallosal people show all the\nbehavioural signs of having fully unified consciousness. If so, then\nthe neurological and behavioural basis of unified consciousness would\nbe very different in different people. (We will return to this last\ntopic in\n Section 8.)\n",
