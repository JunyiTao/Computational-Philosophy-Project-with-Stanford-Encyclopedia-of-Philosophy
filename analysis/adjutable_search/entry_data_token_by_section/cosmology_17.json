    "main_text": "Origins of the Universe || The Limits of Science\n3.5 The Limits of Science\n\nCosmology provokes questions about the limits of scientific\nexplanation because it lacks many of the features that are present in\nother areas of physics. Physical laws are usually regarded as\ncapturing the features of a type of system that remain invariant under\nsome changes, and explanations often work by placing a particular\nevent in larger context. Theories of the initial state cannot appeal\nto either idea: we have access to only one universe, and there is no\nlarger context to appeal to in explaining its properties. This\ncontrast between the types of explanation available in cosmology and\nother areas of physics has often led to dissatisfaction (see, e.g.,\nUnger & Smolin 2014). At the very least, cosmology forces us to\nreconsider basic questions about modalities, and what constitutes\nscientific explanation.\n\nOne challenge to establishing theories of the initial state is\nentirely epistemic. As emphasized in\n \u00a72.4,\n we lack independent experimental probes of physics at the relevant\nscales, so the extensions of core theories described above are only\ntested indirectly through their implications for cosmology. This\nlimitation reflects contingent facts about the universe, namely the\ncontrast between the energy scales of the early universe and those\naccessible to us, and does not follow from the uniqueness of the\nuniverse per se. Yet this limitation does not imply that it would be\nimpossible to establish laws. There are cases in the history of\nphysics, such as celestial mechanics, where confidence in a\ntheory\u2019s laws is based primarily on successful application under\ncontinually improving standards of precision.\n\nA further conceptual challenge regards whether it even makes sense to\nseek \u201claws\u201d in cosmology (Munitz 1962; Ellis 2007). Laws\nare usually taken to cover multiple instances of some type of\nphenomena, or family of objects. What can we mean by\n\u201claws\u201d for a unique object (the universe as a whole) or a\nunique event (its origin)?\n\nCompeting philosophical analyses of laws of nature render different\nverdicts on the possibility of cosmological laws. Cosmological laws,\nif possible, differ from local physical laws in a variety of\nways\u2014they do not apply to subsystems of the universe, they lack\nmultiple instances, and etc. Philosophical accounts of laws take\ndifferent features to be essential to law-hood. For example, the\ninfluential Mill-Ramsey-Lewis account takes the laws to be axioms of\nthe deductive system capturing some body of physical knowledge that\noptimally balances strength (the scope of derived claims) and\nsimplicity (the number of axioms) (see, e.g., Loewer 1996). It is\nquite plausible that a constraint on the initial state, such as\nPenrose\u2019s Weyl curvature hypothesis, would count as a law on\nthis account. By contrast, accounts that take other features, such as\ngoverning evolution, as essential, reach the opposite verdict.\n\nFinally, there are a number of conceptual pitfalls regarding what\nwould count as an adequate \u201cexplanation\u201d of the origins of\nthe universe. What is the target of such explanations, and what can be\nused in providing an explanation? The target might be the state\ndefined at the earliest time when extrapolations based on the SM can\nbe trusted. The challenge is that this state then needs to be\nexplained in terms of a physical theory, quantum gravity, whose basic\nconcepts are still obscure to us. This is a familiar challenge in\nphysics, where substantial work is often required to clarify how\ncentral concepts (such as space and time) are modified by a new\ntheory. An explanation of origins in this first sense would explain\nhow it is that classical spacetime emerges from a quantum gravity\nregime. While any such proposals remain quite speculative, the form of\nthe explanation is similar to other cases in physics: what is\nexplained is the applicability of an older, less fundamental theory\nwithin some domain. Such an explanation does not address ultimate\nquestions regarding why the universe exists\u2014instead, such\nquestions are pushed back one step, into the quantum gravity\nregime.\n\nMany discussions of origins pursue a more ambitious target: they aim\nto explain the creation of the universe \u201cfrom\n nothing\u201d.[39]\n The target is the true initial state, not just the boundary of\napplicability of the SM. The origins are supposedly then explained\nwithout positing an earlier phase of evolution; supposedly this can be\nachieved, for example, by treating the origin of the universe as a\nfluctuation away from a vacuum state. Yet obviously a vacuum state is\nnot nothing: it exists in a spacetime, and has a variety of\nnon-trivial properties. It is a mistake to take this explanation as\nsomehow directly addressing the metaphysical question of why there is\nsomething rather than\n nothing.[40]\n\n",
