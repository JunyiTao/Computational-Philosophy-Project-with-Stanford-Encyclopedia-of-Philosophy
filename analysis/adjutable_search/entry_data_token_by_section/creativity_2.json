By analogy, being\ntold that a carburetor is useful provides no explanatory insight into\nthe nature of a carburetor: how it works and what it does.\n(Stokes 2008: 119; Stokes 2011: 675\u201376)\n\n\nThose who maintain that value is required for creativity might reply\nthat it doesn\u2019t need to be informative or explanatory. Being a\nman is required for being a bachelor even though it\u2019s not\ninformative or explanatory to say that bachelors are men. Stokes notes\nthat \u201ccreative\u201d is a term of praise, and uses this point\nto argue that what is creative must be produced intentionally (since\nwe don\u2019t rightly praise what is unintentional or\naccidental)\u2014an idea we\u2019ll return to below. But the same\npoint also seems to imply that what is creative must also have value\n(since we don\u2019t rightly praise what doesn\u2019t have value).\nAnd while the concept \u201ccarburetor\u201d is value-neutral, as\nshown by the fact that a carburetor can be worthless or useless (if\nit\u2019s broken), \u201ccreative\u201d, one might argue, is a\nvalue-laden concept, like \u201cprogress\u201d. Progress necessarily\ninvolves novelty or change, but we don\u2019t praise change as\nprogress unless it\u2019s good change. Likewise, defenders of the\nvalue condition urge, creativity necessarily involves novelty, but we\ndon\u2019t praise novelty as creative unless it\u2019s good\nnovelty.\n\nOther critics use counterexamples to argue that value isn\u2019t\nnecessary for creativity, the most prominent cases being ones of\nimmoral creativity. (For a collection of essays by psychologists on\nthe phenomenon of immoral or so-called \u201cdark\u201d\ncreativity\u2019, see D. Cropley et al. 2010). Putative cases of\nimmoral creativity include creative accounting to cheat investors or\ncreative testimony to mislead jurors, and the stock example in the\nliterature is creative torture or murder. One can imagine novel and\nwell-designed murders, as Thomas De Quincey once did in a satirical\nessay:\n\n\n[S]omething more goes to the composition of a fine murder than two\nblockheads to kill and be killed\u2014a knife\u2014a purse\u2014and\na dark lane. Design, gentlemen, grouping, light and shade, poetry,\nsentiment, are now deemed indispensable to attempts of this nature.\nMr. Williams has exalted the ideal of murder to all of us [\u2026]\nLike \u00c6schylus or Milton in poetry, like Michael Angelo in\npainting, he has carried his art to a point of colossal sublimity. (De\nQuincey 1827; see also discussion in Battin et al. 1989)\n\n\nInnovative ways of inflicting needless agony and craftily designed\nmurders are not good (they have no value), and yet they can be\ncreative. If this is right, then it seems to follow that creativity\ndoesn\u2019t require value.\n\nOne way of trying to save the value condition is by flatly denying\nthat torture methods can be creative, and by denying more generally\nthat creative things can be bad (Novitz 1999). But such denial seems\nad hoc and implausible\u2014\u201cevil creativity\u201d is not a\ncontradiction in terms\u2014and some have argued that this denial\nfaces other problems besides (Livingston 2018).\n\nOther theorists revise or qualify the value condition in order to\naccommodate examples of immoral creativity. Paisley Livingston (2018)\nproposes that a creative product only needs to be instrumentally\nvaluable or \u201ceffective\u201d as means to its intended end,\nregardless of whether that end is morally good, bad, or indifferent.\nBerys Gaut (2018) distinguishes between something\u2019s being\ngood (or good, period) versus being good of its\nkind. In his view, a new way of wielding blades and pulleys may\nbe creative if it\u2019s a good of its kind\u2014good as a method of\ntorture\u2014even though it isn\u2019t good. In order for something\nto count as creative, Gaut says, it doesn\u2019t need to be good; it\njust needs to be good of its kind.\n\nAlison Hills and Alexander Bird (2018) are unconvinced by such\nqualifications. They contemplate an elaborate torture device that ends\nup killing its victims immediately, \u201cwithout enough suffering on\nthe way\u201d. The device may still be creative, they hold, even\nthough \u201cas a method of torture, it\u2019s no good\u201d (2018:\n98). Indeed, they argue, a creative item needn\u2019t be good in any\nway at all, not even for its creator. The ineffective torture device\njust described doesn\u2019t satisfy its creator\u2019s preferences,\nit doesn\u2019t give him pleasure, it isn\u2019t an achievement, it\ndoesn\u2019t contribute at all to his well-being\u2014and yet, they\ncontend, it may be creative, provided that it\u2019s new and was\nproduced in the right way. Exactly what \u201cthe right way\u201d\namounts to is the topic we turn to next.\n",
