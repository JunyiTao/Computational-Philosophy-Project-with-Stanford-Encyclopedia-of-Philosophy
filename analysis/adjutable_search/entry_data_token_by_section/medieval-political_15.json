    "main_text": "Papal Fullness of Power\n8. Papal Fullness of Power\n\nSo much for the sources of medieval political philosophy and its early\nstages. Let us turn now to the contributions made by scholastic and\nlate scholastic writers, who often became involved in conflict between\nsecular rulers and the papacy.\n\nOne focus of controversy was the papal claim to \u201cfullness of\npower\u201d. Originally the claim meant that the pope had\npreeminently whatever power any other authority had within the Church,\nso that he could intervene by full right in any Church affair\n(Rivi\u00e8re 1925). Pope Innocent III (1198\u20131216), whose\ndecretals repeatedly \u201cexalted papal political power\u201d\n(Pennington 2007: 165), provided the fodder for subsequent jurists to\ndevelop the notion of papal fullness of\n power.[45]\n During the thirteenth century this conception was also invoked when\nthe pope authorised the mendicant friars to preach and perform\nreligious functions in a diocese even without the consent of the\ndiocesan bishop. Such interventions were strongly opposed by many\nsecular clerics who argued that bishops had their authority by divine\nlaw and were not merely agents of the\n pope.[46]\n\n\nDuring the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries popes also claimed the\nright to intervene in affairs normally the province of secular rulers.\nThis claim was made especially in reference to the Roman Empire. Pope\nLeo III had crowned Charlemagne as Roman Emperor in 800, and in 962\nPope John XII gave the title \u201cRoman Emperor\u201d to the German\nprince Otto I. From then until 1806 a succession of German princes\nclaimed the title. The popes took the view that they had transferred\nthe Empire from the Greeks to the Franks in the person of Charlemagne,\nand from the Franks to the Germans in the person of Otto I, thereby\nshowing that the Roman Empire was subject to the popes, and in\nparticular that the pope had a right to approve or reject the\ncandidate elected to be emperor. (The emperor was elected by the\nGerman princes who constituted the electoral college\u2014like the\npope, the emperor was a monarch chosen by an electoral college to hold\noffice for life.) The subject of the \u201ctranslation\u201d of the\nempire often became a subject of intense\n debate.[47]\n Spain, France, England and some other places rejected the authority\nof the \u201cRoman Empire\u201d, but incidents in the history of\nvarious kingdoms supported papal claims to authority over kings.\n\nBesides the historical arguments there were theological or\nphilosophical arguments. If \u201cthere is no power but from\nGod\u201d\n (Romans 13:1,\n \u00a72.1 above) and the pope is God\u2019s representative on\nearth, then it seems that power comes to Christian kings through the\npope. Medieval writers were not well acquainted with Plato\u2019s\nnotion of a \u201cphilosopher king\u201d\n (Republic, 473d),\n since very little of Plato had been translated into\n Latin,[48]\n but in effect pro-papal theologians were arguing that the pope was a\n\u201ctheologian king\u201d, an expert on the meaning of life whose\nguidance was authoritative in all matters.\n\nThe popes did not in fact wish to take on the burdens of day-to-day\ngovernment throughout the world. Their claim was that, while ruling\nwas normally the business of secular rulers, the pope could intervene\nby full right in governmental matters whenever he saw good reason to\ndo so. Canon lawyers drew up lists of circumstances in which the pope\nmight intervene (for examples, see Tierney 1980: 153\u20134), but\nsome items in the list were so comprehensive as to leave no area in\nwhich popes could not intervene. For example, intervention ratione\npeccati, \u201cby reason of sin\u201d, meant that if a secular\nruler commits an injustice (which is a sin) then the pope might\nintervene.\n\nPapal claims were opposed by secular rulers, by clerical writers who\nsaw some interest in defending the secular rulers, and by theologians\nunconvinced by the pro-papal arguments and concerned about the likely\neffects of papal encroachment. Most of the political writers of the\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries were involved in controversy about\nthe extent and limits (or absence of limits) of papal authority\n(Miethke 2000a; Oakley 2012: 173ff. and 2015: 14ff.).\n",
