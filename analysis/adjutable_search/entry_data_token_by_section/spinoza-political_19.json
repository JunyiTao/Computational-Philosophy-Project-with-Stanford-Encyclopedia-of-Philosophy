    "main_text": "The Place of the State in Spinoza\u2019s Ontology\n6. The Reception and Influence of Spinoza\u2019s Political Philosophy\n\n\nIn is difficult to assess adequately the scope of influence of\nSpinoza\u2019s political thought. Even where Spinoza\u2019s influence\non subsequent political thinkers is direct and indisputable, it is not\nalways easy to tease out the extent to this influence is due to his own\npolitical philosophy, as opposed to his metaphysics. Further\ncomplicating the assessment is the fact that Spinoza and Spinozism\nremained a bugbear throughout Europe for much of the late\n17th and 18th centuries, during which time\nSpinozism was widely associated with atheism. For this reason, even\nsympathetic philosophers often sought to distance their views\nfrom Spinoza\u2019s, positioning themselves as critics or downplaying\nfamiliarity with his texts. Nevertheless, we find traces of the\ninfluence of Spinoza\u2019s political writings throughout the\nEnlightenment, along with an array of hostile responses.\n\n\nThe publication of the unfinished TP in Spinoza\u2019s posthumous\nOpera was met with relative indifference, upstaged as it was\nby the simultaneous appearance of Ethics (Laerke 2010, 122).\nHowever, the TTP was read, discussed, and condemned in the decades\nfollowing its publication. The critical reception tended to focus on\nthe perceived anti-religious features of the work\u2014for instance,\nthe refutation of miracles and the denial of the divine origin of the\nPentateuch\u2014but the naturalistic account of right and law and the\narguments for the freedom to philosophize also provoked debate.\n\n\nJakob Thomasius, Leibniz\u2019s teacher in Leipzig, composed a\nwork, Adversus Anonymum, de Libertate Philosophandi,\ndevoted entirely to the refutation of the TTP and its underlying\nnaturalism. Leibniz too seems to have regarded Spinoza\u2019s views on\nright and law as more dangerous even than Hobbes\u2019, for while Hobbes at\nleast allowed conceptual space for a divine legislator, Spinoza did\nnot (Laerke 2010, 125). Even relatively liberal natural lawyers like Lambert van Velthuysen\n(1622\u20131685) and Samuel Pufendorf (1632\u20131694), regarded\nSpinoza\u2019s treatment of right and obligation as fundamentally\ndestructive. Velthuysen objects that, without a divine legislator,\nthere is \u201cno room left for precepts and commandments\u201d (Ep.\n42) in Spinoza\u2019s philosophy. And Pufendorf maintains that Spinoza\u2019s\nconception of right is defective in that it fails to produce a\n\u201cmoral effect\u201d or to put others under obligations\n(Pufendorf 1934, 391; see Curley 1995).\n\n\nWhile Spinoza\u2019s views on right and law were generally met with\ncontempt, his views on the freedom to philosophize [libertas\nphilosophandi] provoked a more balanced reaction. The doctrine\nhad its critics (see e.g., Israel 2010, 81\u20132), but it also had\nits admirers, perhaps including some of the most prominent early-modern\ntolerationists. Bayle, Locke, and Toland, for instance, were familiar\nwith Spinoza\u2019s defense and likely found some inspiration in it,\neven while they denied deep acquaintance (Locke) or situated themselves\nas critics (Bayle and Toland). Toland\u2019s use in\nPantheisticon of the same epigram from the opening of\nTacitus\u2019 Histories\u2014\u201crare are the happy times\nwhen we may think what we wish and say what we think [rara\ntemporum felicitas ubi sentire quae velis et quae sentias dicere\nlicet]\u201d\u2013 that Spinoza draws from in the title of TTP,\nCh. 20 indicates an affinity between the two thinkers on matters of\nfreedom of speech and thought (for more on the use of this epigram in\nthe 17th and 18th centuries, see Paul Russell\n2010, Ch. 7),\n\n\nLater enlightenment thinkers reprise Spinoza\u2019s claim that\nwhereas the freedoms of thought and expression should be protected, one\nought to obey the sovereign\u2019s decisions on matters of action (TTP\n20, 251\u20132). Echoes of this view may be found in Moses\nMendelssohn\u2019s separation of action and conviction in\nJerusalem (Mendelssohn 1983, 40; Gottlieb 2011, 50), a work\nfor which one scholar maintains that the TTP \u201cserves, if not as\nmodel, at least as decisive subtext\u201d (Goetschel 2004, 168). This\ndivision was even adopted by Frederick the Great, whose policy that men\nmay argue about whatever they wish, provided that they obey is famously\ncelebrated in Kant\u2019s essay \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d\n[Was ist Aufkl\u00e4rung?].\n\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning Spinoza\u2019s influence on the\ndemocratic thought of the French Enlightenment. Jonathan Israel has\nexamined the myriad ways in which Spinoza\u2019s philosophy shaped\negalitarian political thought, including, perhaps most significantly,\nthe political thought of the encyclop\u00e9distes (Israel 2011).\nSpinoza\u2019s influence here is primarily due to his naturalism,\nwhich inspired the materialist metaphysics that underpinned French\ndemocratic thought, rather than to his political arguments. And\nSpinoza\u2019s realist and arguably anti-revolutionary political\nmethod suggests that even if Spinoza\u2019s philosophy influenced\nrevolutionary democratic thought, it may have had little to do with his\nactual political philosophy. (For divergent assessments of\nSpinoza\u2019s attitude towards revolution, see Rosenthal 2013 and\nSharp 2013). Nevertheless, one finds more than a whiff of\nSpinoza\u2019s absolutist conception of democracy in the accounts of the general will\n[volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale] found in\nRousseau (see Ekstein 1944; Williams 2010) and Diderot (Israel\n2011).\n\n\nMore recently, Spinoza\u2019s political philosophy has figured\nprominently in post-1968 leftist French political thought (for a\nsurvey, see van Bunge 2012). However, in the United States, few\npolitical philosophers have seriously engaged Spinoza\u2019s work,\neven while scholarly interest has grown. There is reason to hope,\nhowever, that as Spinoza continues to emerge from Hobbes\u2019 shadow,\npolitical philosophers here may begin to appreciate the rich,\nconsistent, and resourceful arguments contained in his political\nwritings.\n",
