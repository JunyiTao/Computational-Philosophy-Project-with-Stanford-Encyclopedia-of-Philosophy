    "main_text": "Varieties of Transformative Experience || Art and Fiction\n1.7 Art and Fiction\n\nPaul (2014) opens Transformative Experience with thought\nexperiment about transforming into glamorous, slightly murderous,\ncreatures of the night: vampires. Obviously, none of us actually face\nthis choice. However, rhetorically, thinking about turning into a\nfictional creature helps motivate the idea that doing so would be both\nepistemically and personally transformative. After all, who can say\nfor sure what becoming a vampire would really be like or how it would\nchange a person? Furthermore, this case reveals something further\nabout the connection between fiction, art, and transformative\nexperience. It could be that art is transformative\u2014or at least\nquasi-transformative\u2014because it helps us understand things that\nwe have not (or cannot) experience (Aumann 2022). Furthermore, art and\nfiction might be transformative from the perspective of the creator as\nwell as the audience. For instance, the expression of oneself through\nart may be a transformative experience (Riggle 2020). Finally, art\nclearly involves our imaginations, and imagination may provide a way\nto gain knowledge about what a transformative is like prior to\nexperiencing it. (More on this in\n \u00a72.)\n",
