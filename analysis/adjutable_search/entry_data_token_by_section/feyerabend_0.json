    "main_text": "A Brief Chronology of Feyerabend\u2019s Life and Work\n1. A Brief Chronology of Feyerabend\u2019s Life and Work\n\n\n1924\nBorn in Vienna. Son of a civil servant and a seamstress.\n\n\n1940\nWas inducted into the Arbeitsdienst (the work service\nintroduced by the Nazis). \n\n1942\nDrafted into the Pioneer Corps of the German army. After basic\ntraining, volunteered for Officers\u2019 School. \n\n1943\nLearned of his mother\u2019s suicide. \n\n1944\nDecorated, Iron Cross. Advanced to Lieutenant. Lectured to\nOfficers\u2019 School. \n\n1945\nShot in the hand and in the belly during the retreat from the\nRussian Army. The bullet damaged his spinal nerves. \n\n1946\nReceived a fellowship to study singing and stage-management in\nWeimar. Joined the \u201cCultural Association for the Democratic\nReform of Germany\u201d. \n\n1947\nReturned to Vienna to study history and sociology at the\nUniversity. Soon transferred to physics. First article, on the concept\nof illustration in modern physics, published. Feyerabend \u201ca\nraving positivist\u201d at the time. \n\n1948\nFirst visit to the Alpbach seminar of the Austrian College\nSociety. Became secretary of the seminars. Met Karl Popper and Walter\nHollitscher. Married first wife, Edeltrud. \n\n1949\nBecame student leader of the \u201cKraft Circle\u201d, a\nstudent philosophy club centred around Viktor Kraft,\nFeyerabend\u2019s dissertation supervisor and a former member of the\nVienna Circle. Ludwig Wittgenstein visited the Kraft Circle to give a\ntalk. Feyerabend also met Bertolt Brecht. \n\n1951\nReceived doctorate in philosophy for his thesis on \u201cbasic\nstatements\u201d. Applied for a British Council scholarship to study\nunder Wittgenstein at Cambridge. But Wittgenstein died before\nFeyerabend arrived in England, so Feyerabend chose Popper as his\nsupervisor instead. \n\n1952\nCame to England, to study under Popper at the London School of\nEconomics. Concentrated on the quantum theory and Wittgenstein.\nStudied the typescript of Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical\nInvestigations, and prepared a summary of the book. Befriended\nanother of Popper\u2019s students, Joseph Agassi. \n\n1953\nFeyerabend returned to Vienna. Popper applied for an extension\nto his scholarship, but Feyerabend decided to remain in Vienna\ninstead. Translated Popper\u2019s The Open Society and its\nEnemies into German. Declined the offer to become Popper\u2019s\nresearch assistant. Agassi took the post. Feyerabend became research\nassistant to Arthur Pap in Vienna. \n\n1954\nFirst articles on quantum mechanics and on Wittgenstein\npublished. Pap introduced Feyerabend to Herbert Feigl. \n\n1955\nTook up his first full-time academic appointment as lecturer in\nphilosophy at the University of Bristol, England. His summary of\nWittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical Investigations appeared as\na review of the book in The Philosophical Review. \n\n1956\nMarried second wife, Mary O\u2019Neill. Published an article on\nthe \u201cparadox of analysis\u201d. Feyerabend got to know the\nquantum physicist David Bohm, whose ideas were to influence him\nsubstantially. \n\n1957\nGave a paper on the quantum theory of measurement to the Colston\nResearch Symposium at the University of Bristol. \n\n1958\nTook up visiting lectureship at the University of California,\nBerkeley. Two of his most important early papers, \u201cAn Attempt at\na Realistic Interpretation of Experience\u201d, and\n\u201cComplementarity\u201d appeared in the proceedings of the\nAristotelian Society. In them, Feyerabend argued against positivism\nand in favour of a scientific realist account of the relation between\ntheory and experience, largely on grounds familiar from Karl\nPopper\u2019s falsificationist views. \n\n1959\nAccepted a permanent position at Berkeley, and applied for a\nGreen Card to work in the US. \n\n1960\nAs a result of earlier discussions with Herbert Feigl,\nFeyerabend published \u201cDas Problem der Existenz theoretischer\nEntit\u00e4ten\u201d, in which he argued that there is no special\n\u201cproblem\u201d of theoretical entities, and that all\nentities are hypothetical. Gave two lectures to Oberlin College, Ohio,\nin which he embroidered on Popper\u2019s views about the pre-Socratic\nthinkers. \n\n1962\n\u201cExplanation, Reduction, and Empiricism\u201d appeared.\nCriticised existing empiricist accounts of explanation and theoretical\nreduction (Hempel, Nagel), and introduced the concept of\nincommensurability, based on the \u201ccontextual theory of\nmeaning\u201d which Feyerabend claimed to find in\nWittgenstein\u2019s Investigations. \n\n1963\n\u201cHow to be a Good Empiricist\u201d, a position paper\nsumming up his point of view, was published, along with his two main\narticles on the Mind/Body Problem in which he introduced the position\nnow known as \u201celiminative materialism\u201d. \n\n1965\nPublication of the first part of the essay \u201cProblems of\nEmpiricism\u201d, and his \u201cReply to Criticism\u201d, in which\nFeyerabend made his last serious attempt to construct a\n\u201ctolerant\u201d, \u201cdisinfected\u201d empiricism. Although\nbeginning to put some distance between himself and Popper, Feyerabend\nwas still able to write a glowing review of Popper\u2019s\nConjectures and Refutations. \n\n1967\u20138\nFocus of his published papers had by now moved to\n\u201ctheoretical pluralism\u201d, the view that in order to\nmaximise the chances of falsifying existing theories, scientists\nshould construct and defend as many alternative theories as possible.\nFeyerabend\u2019s articles \u201cOn a Recent Critique of\nComplementarity\u201d defended Niels Bohr\u2019s views against\nPopper\u2019s critique. Popper not amused. \n\n1969\nIn a tiny article, \u201cScience Without Experience\u201d,\nFeyerabend finally gave up the attempt to be an empiricist, arguing\nthat in principle experience is necessary at no point in the\nconstruction, comprehension or testing of empirical scientific\ntheories. \n\n1970\nPublication of \u201cConsolations for the Specialist\u201d, in\nwhich Feyerabend attacked Popper from a Kuhnian point of view, and the\nessay version of \u201cAgainst Method: Outline of an Anarchistic\nTheory of Knowledge\u201d, in which \u201cepistemological\nanarchism\u201d was revealed for the first time. Feyerabend claimed\nto be applying the liberalism of John Stuart Mill\u2019s On\nLiberty to scientific methodology. Published little during the\nnext few years. \n\n1974\nDeath of Feyerabend\u2019s friend Imre Lakatos, putting paid to\ntheir plans to produce a dialogue volume, For and Against\nMethod. Feyerabend, lecturing at the University of Sussex, was\nill too. Published a scathing review of Popper\u2019s Objective\nKnowledge. \n\n1975\nAppearance of Feyerabend\u2019s first book, Against\nMethod, setting out \u201cepistemological anarchism\u201d,\nwhose main thesis was that there is no such thing as the\nscientific method. Great scientists are methodological opportunists\nwho use any moves that come to hand, even if they thereby violate\ncanons of empiricist methodology. \n\n1976\u20137\nFeyerabend replies to most of the major reviewers of Against\nMethod. Got depressed. Published his first major article on\nrelativism: the first time he explicitly endorsed the view. \n\n1978\nScience in a Free Society appears, including replies to\nreviewers of Against Method. Some clarification of\nepistemological anarchism, and very little retreat from the position\nset out in AM. Explored further the political implications of\nepistemological anarchism. The book also included one of\nFeyerabend\u2019s major endorsements of relativism, one of the views\nfor which he was becoming known. First volume of the German edition of\nFeyerabend\u2019s philosophical papers appears. (Feyerabend published\nincreasingly in German from this point onwards). \n\n1981\nEnglish publication of the first two volumes of\nFeyerabend\u2019s Philosophical Papers, with new material in\nintroductory chapters. \n\n1983\nMet Grazia Borrini at his Berkeley lectures. \n\n1984\nPublishes \u201cScience as an Art\u201d, in which he defends\nan explicitly relativistic account of the history of science according\nto which there is change, but no \u201cprogress\u201d. Also\ncontinues his campaign to rehabilitate Ernst Mach. \n\n1987\nPublication of Farewell to Reason, a volume collecting\nsome of the papers Feyerabend had published between 1981 and 1987.\nRelativism again at the forefront, especially in its\n\u201cProtagorean\u201d version. \n\n1988\nSecond, revised edition of Against Method, omitting the\nlong chapter on the history of the visual arts, but now incorporating\nparts of Science in a Free Society, appeared. \n\n1989\nPaul and Grazia married in January. Left for Italy and\nSwitzerland in the fall, at least partly because of the effects of the\nOctober earthquake in California. \n\n1990\nOfficially resigned from Berkeley in March. \n\n1991\nRetired from Zurich. Three Dialogues on Knowledge and\nBeyond Reason, a festschrift edited by a former pupil,\nGonzalo Mun\u00e9var, published. Also lots of small publications,\nmany of them in Common Knowledge. Signs of an increasing\nunhappiness with relativism in Feyerabend\u2019s publications around\nthis time. But still vigorously opposed to\n\u201cobjectivism\u201d. \n\n1993\nThird edition of Against Method published. Feyerabend\ndeveloped an inoperable brain tumour, and was hospitalized. \n\n1994\nFeyerabend died in the Genolier clinic (Genolier, Canton of\nVaud, Switzerland), February 11th. Several major memorial symposia and\ncolloquia on his work took place over the next two years. \n\n1995\nKilling Time: The Autobiography of Paul Feyerabend\npublished. \n\n1999\nConquest of Abundance published. \n\n",
