    "main_text": "\n\nRussell remains famous as a logician, a metaphysician, and as a\nphilosopher of mathematics, but in his own day he was also notorious\nfor his social and political opinions. He wrote an immense amount\nabout practical ethics\u2014women\u2019s rights, marriage and morals, war\nand peace, and the vexed question of whether socialists should smoke\ngood cigars. (They should.) And unlike present-day practical ethicists\n(with a few notable exceptions such as Peter Singer) he was widely\nread by the non-philosophical public. (See for instance Phillips 2013,\nwhich details Russell\u2019s successes as a popular moralist in the 1950s.)\nBut though Russell was famous as a moralist and famous as a\nphilosopher, he does not have much of a reputation as a moral\nphilosopher in the more technical sense of the term. Until very\nrecently, his contributions to what is nowadays known as ethical\ntheory\u2014meta-ethics (the nature and justification, if any,\nof moral judgments) and normative ethics (what makes right acts right\netc)\u2014were either unknown, disregarded or dismissed as\nunoriginal. Key texts on the history of twentieth century\nethics\u2014Warnock\u2019s Ethics Since 1900 (1978), Urmson\u2019s\nThe Emotivist Theory of Ethics (1968), Milller\u2019s\nContemporary Metaethics: an Introduction (2013) and\nSchroeder\u2019s Non-Cognitivism in Ethics (2010)\u2014say\nnothing, or next to nothing, about Russell, at least in his capacity\nas a moral philosopher. It is only very recently\u2014in the last\nfifteen years or so\u2014that ethical theorists have begun to pay\nattention to him. (See Pigden 2003, 2007 and Potter 2006, though\nL.W. Aiken 1963 anticipated Potter and Pigden by about forty years.)\nPerhaps Russell would not have repined, since he professed himself\ndissatisfied with what he had said \u201con the\nphilosophical basis of ethics\u201d (RoE:\n165/Papers 11: 310). But since he took an equally dim view of\nwhat he had read on that topic, the fact that he did not\nthink much of his own contributions does not mean that he thought them\nany worse than anybody else\u2019s. In my view, they are often rather\nbetter and deserve to be disinterred. But \u201cdisinterred\u201d is\nthe word since some of his most original contributions were left\nunpublished in his own lifetime and what he did publish was\noften buried in publications ostensibly devoted to less theoretical\ntopics. Thus Russell\u2019s brilliant little paper \u201cIs There an\nAbsolute Good\u201d, which anticipates Mackie\u2019s \u201cThe Refutation\nof Morals\u201d by over twenty years, was delivered in 1922 at a\nmeeting of the Apostles (an exclusive, prestigious but secret\nCambridge discussion group of which Moore, Russell, and Ramsey were\nall members) and was not published until 1988. And Russell\u2019s version\nof emotivism (which anticipates Ayer\u2019s Language, Truth and\nLogic (1936) by one year, and Stevenson\u2019s \u201cThe Emotive\nMeaning of Ethical Terms\u201d (1937) by two) appeared towards the\nend of a popular book, Religion and Science (1935), whose\nprincipal purpose was not to discuss the nature of moral judgments,\nbut to do down religion in the name of science. However, Russell\u2019s\ndissatisfaction with his writings on ethical theory did not extend to\nhis writings on social and political topics.\n\n\nI have no difficulty in practical moral judgments, which I find I make\non a roughly hedonistic [i.e., utilitarian] basis, but, when\nit comes to the philosophy of moral judgments, I am impelled in two\nopposite directions and remain perplexed. (RoE:\n165\u20136/Papers 11: 311)\n\n\nHis perplexity, however, was theoretical rather than practical. He was\npretty clear about what we ought to do (work for world\ngovernment, for example), but \u201cperplexed\u201d about what he\nmeant when he said that we ought to do it.\n\nOne point to stress, before we go on. Russell took a pride in his\nwillingness to change his mind. Obstinacy in the face of\ncounter-arguments was not, in his opinion, a virtue in a\nscientifically-minded philosopher. Unfortunately he overdid the\nopen-mindedness, abandoning good theories for worse ones in the face\nof weak counter-arguments and sometimes forgetting some of his own\nbest insights (a forgivable fault in given the fountain of good ideas\nthat seemed to be continually erupting in his head). Russell\u2019s mental\ndevelopment, therefore, is not always a stirring tale of intellectual\nprogress. His first thoughts are often better than his second thoughts\nand his second thoughts better than his third thoughts. Thus the\nemotivism that was his dominant view in the latter part of his life is\nvulnerable to objections that he himself had raised in an earlier\nincarnation, as was the error theory that he briefly espoused in 1922.\nNobody should be surprised, therefore, if I sometimes deploy an\nearlier Russell to criticize one of his later selves. Whitehead is\nreported to have said that Russell was a Platonic dialogue in himself,\nand in this temporally extended debate quite often it is one of the\nyounger Russells who wins the argument.\n",
