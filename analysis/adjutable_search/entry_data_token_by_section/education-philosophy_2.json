Areas of Contemporary Activity\n\nAs was stressed at the outset, the field of education is huge and\ncontains within it a virtually inexhaustible number of issues that are\nof philosophical interest. To attempt comprehensive coverage of how\nphilosophers of education have been working within this thicket would\nbe a quixotic task for a large single volume and is out of the\nquestion for a solitary encyclopedia entry. Nevertheless, a valiant\nattempt to give an overview was made in A Companion to the\nPhilosophy of Education (Curren 2003), which contains more than\nsix-hundred pages divided into forty-five chapters each of which\nsurveys a subfield of work. The following random selection of chapter\ntopics gives a sense of the enormous scope of the field: Sex\neducation, special education, science education, aesthetic education,\ntheories of teaching and learning, religious education, knowledge,\ntruth and learning, cultivating reason, the measurement of learning,\nmulticultural education, education and the politics of identity,\neducation and standards of living, motivation and classroom\nmanagement, feminism, critical theory, postmodernism, romanticism, the\npurposes of universities, affirmative action in higher education, and\nprofessional education. The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of\nEducation (Siegel 2009) contains a similarly broad range of\narticles on (among other things) the epistemic and moral aims of\neducation, liberal education and its imminent demise, thinking and\nreasoning, fallibilism and fallibility, indoctrination, authenticity,\nthe development of rationality, Socratic teaching, educating the\nimagination, caring and empathy in moral education, the limits of\nmoral education, the cultivation of character, values education,\ncurriculum and the value of knowledge, education and democracy, art\nand education, science education and religious toleration,\nconstructivism and scientific methods, multicultural education,\nprejudice, authority and the interests of children, and on pragmatist,\nfeminist, and postmodernist approaches to philosophy of education.\n\nGiven this enormous range, there is no non-arbitrary way to select a\nsmall number of topics for further discussion, nor can the topics that\nare chosen be pursued in great depth. The choice of those below has\nbeen made with an eye to highlighting contemporary work that makes\nsolid contact with and contributes to important discussions in general\nphilosophy and/or the academic educational and educational research\ncommunities.\n",
