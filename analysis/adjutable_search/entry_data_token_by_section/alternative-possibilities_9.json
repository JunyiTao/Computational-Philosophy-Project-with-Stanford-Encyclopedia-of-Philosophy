    "main_text": "Arguments for PAP || Moral Arguments\n2.4 Moral Arguments\n\nA broader concern about the previous defense is that it grounds our\nprinciple in the metaphysics of agency rather than in the nature of\nmoral responsibility. Morality, the thought goes, should be more\ndirectly engaged in defense of PAP, a principle that explicitly\nconstrains our practices of praise and blame. It\u2019s not\nsurprising, then, that a number of arguments supporting PAP start from\nmoral premises.\n\nA straightforward moral argument says it\u2019s not fair to praise or\nblame a person for doing something that was, for her, unavoidable (for\ndiscussion see, e.g., Glover 1970: 70\u20133; Watson 1996; Nelkin\n2011: ch. 2). A responsible agent is a proper target of the\nreactive attitudes, and unfairly or unjustly blaming someone, however\nexpedient, would not be morally proper. One challenge for this defense\nof PAP is that fairness is itself entangled with the reactive\nattitudes (P. F. Strawson 1962; cp. Wallace 1994: 4.3). Thus, those\nwho wonder whether praise and blame require alternatives are unlikely\nto be persuaded by the claim that fair targeting by the\nreactive attitudes requires alternatives\u2014at least not without\nfurther argument. Someone questioning PAP, that is, is unlikely to be\nswayed by a moral appeal that seems only to reassert the\nprinciple.\n\nAnother line appeals to the principle, often associated with Kant\n(1785), that \u201cought\u201d implies \u201ccan\u201d (OIC). You\ncannot be morally obligated to do something that\u2019s impossible\nfor you. While it would be good for you to eradicate world hunger, you\nare under no obligation to do so for the simple reason that you\ncan\u2019t. (You may, however, be obligated to relieve hunger to the\nextent you can.) Perhaps OIC is not, as Reid thought, \u201cas\nself-evident as the axioms of mathematics\u201d (Reid 1788: IV.v),\nbut it is nevertheless very plausible.\n\nNow return to PAP. Suppose Kristin robs a bank. A first try at the\nargument runs as follows (here we take refraining from doing\nsomething to be a way doing something else; for a bit more on this,\nsee\n \u00a74.2.2):\n\nP1.\n If Kristin is blameworthy for robbing the bank, then she ought\nnot to have done so.\nP2. \n If Kristin ought not to have robbed the bank, then she could have\nrefrained from doing so.\nC. \n Therefore, if Kristin is blameworthy for robbing the bank, then\nshe could have refrained from doing so.\n\n\nP1 looks safe, assuming that the moral sense of blame is in play (but\nsee Capes 2012; Haji 2019). P2 is an instance of OIC. However, the\nconclusion, even when generalized, stops short of PAP, as it claims\nmerely that alternatives are necessary for actions for which one is\nmorally blameworthy; it is silent on actions for which one is morally\npraiseworthy, and it\u2019s harder to see how OIC could be leveraged\nto cover such actions (Frankfurt 1983). After all, when you do\nsomething praiseworthy, you act as you should, so OIC can\u2019t get\na grip on alternative courses of action. That said, if some version of\nthe above argument were sound, this would be a major victory for\nproponents of PAP. (Compare C. A. Campbell 1951: 451; van Inwagen\n1983: 161; Widerker 1991; Copp 1997; critics include Yaffe 1999, 2005;\nsee also Widerker 2003; Speak 2005.)\n\nA third moral argument for PAP is closely related to the first two. It\nis the \u201cWhat-should-he-have-done defense,\u201d or\n\u201cW-defense\u201d for short (Widerker 2003). Like the argument\nin the previous paragraph, the W-defense is designed to apply to\nactions for which an agent is morally blameworthy. If Trent is to be\nblamed for loudly coughing during Maggie\u2019s lecture, it\u2019s\nmorally reasonable to expect him to have refrained from coughing. But\nthe central thought is that this expectation is not morally\nreasonable if he couldn\u2019t help himself due to, say, a\nbug\u2019s flying into his mouth. \u201cWhat would you have had me\ndo?,\u201d he might ask a peeved Maggie. Without any satisfactory\nanswer to such a question, blame seems inappropriate.\n",
