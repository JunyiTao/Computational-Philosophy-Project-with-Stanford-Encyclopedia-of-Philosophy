    "main_text": "Some (Unresolved) Empirical Issues || Extent\n6.3 Prognosis\n\nRelated worries might also apply to claims about the prognosis for\nalienation, in particular, about whether and how alienation might be\novercome. Consider, for instance, Marx\u2019s view that communist\nsociety will be free of certain systematic forms of alienation, such\nas alienation in work. Marx\u2019s view about communism rests crucially on the judgement that it is the social relations of\ncapitalist society, and not its material or technical arrangements,\nwhich are the cause of systematic forms of alienation. For instance,\nhe holds that it is not the existence of science, technology, and\nindustrialisation, as such, which are at the root of the social and\npsychological ills of alienation, but rather how those factors tend to\nbe organised and used in a capitalist society. (For present\npurposes, just assume that a society is capitalist when its\neconomic structure is based on a particular class division \u2013 in\nwhich producers can only access means of production by selling their\nlabour power\u2014and when production, and much else, is driven\nby a remorseless search for profit.) In volume one of\nCapital, Marx writes approvingly of workers who, through time\nand experience, had learnt \u2018to distinguish between machinery and\nits employment by capital, and to direct their attacks, not against\nthe material instruments of production, but against the mode in which\nthey are used\u2019 (1996: 432). If this had not been his view, Marx\ncould not have, consistently, also suggested that communist society\n\u2013 which, on his account, is similarly technologically advanced\nand industrial\u2014could avoid this kind of alienation. This\nsuggestion is, nonetheless, strikingly sanguine. Marx is confident,\nfor instance, that the considerable gulf between the gloomy results of\nadopting machinery in the capitalist present (where it increases the\nrepetitiveness of tasks, narrows talents, promotes\n\u2018deskilling\u2019, and so on) and the bright promise of its\nadoption in the communist future (where it will liberate us from\nuncreative tasks, create greater wealth, develop all-round abilities,\nand so on) is easily bridged. However, Marx\u2019s\n\u2018utopophobia\u2019\u2014that is, his reluctance to say very\nmuch, in any close detail, about the future shape of socialist\nsociety \u2013 prevents him from offering any serious discussion\nabout how precisely this might be done (Leopold 2016). As a result,\neven the mildest of sceptics could reasonably worry that a range of\ndifficult empirical and other questions are evaded rather than\nanswered here.\n\nThis issue\u2014whether, and to what extent, alienation can be\novercome in modern societies\u2014is sometimes conflated with the\nissue of whether, and to what extent, alienation is a historically\nuniversal phenomena. To see that these are distinct questions,\nimagine that alienation only emerges in economically developed\nsocieties, that it is a necessary feature of economically developed\nsocieties, and that economically developed societies never revert\nvoluntarily to economically undeveloped ones. These are not\nimplausible claims, but together they seem to entail that, although\nonly a subset of historical societies are scarred by\nalienation, if you happen to live in an economically developed\nsociety, then\u2014involuntary Armageddon apart\u2014alienation will\nremain the fate of you and your successors.\n\nMy aim here is not to make significant progress in resolving any of\nthese empirical and quasi-empirical issues, but rather to\nacknowledge their existence and extent. Since the concept of\nalienation diagnoses a complex range of social ills involving self and\nother, it is perhaps not surprising that a variety of such issues\nare implicated in these various accounts of its proper\ncharacterisation, its historical scope, and the possibilities for\novercoming it. Nonetheless, it remains important to acknowledge the\nexistence and complexity of these empirical and quasi-empirical\nthreads, not least because they are not always adequately recognised\nor dealt with in the broadly philosophical discussions of alienation\nwhich are the focus of the discussion here. \n",
