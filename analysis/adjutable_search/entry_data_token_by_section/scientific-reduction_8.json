Ronald Endicott argues that New Wave reductionists fail to\nrecognize the important distinction between mere replacements\non the one hand (that correspond to eliminativism, rather than\nreductionism), and proper reductions on the other (Endicott 1998,\n2001). Insofar as New Wave reductionists conceive of reduction in\nterms of replacement, they just miss the target. If they conceive of\nreduction in terms of smooth reductions, then, basically, they repeat\nthe Nagelian model in new terminology. A similar point has been made\nby Dizadji Bahmani et al. (2010). The authors point out that,\nespecially when Schaffner\u2019s model is conceived of as being\nbasically Nagelian in spirit, New Wave reductionism just is Nagelian\nreduction.\n\nEndicott as well as Dizadji Bahmani et al. (2010) argue that the sole\ndifference between the classical Nagel-model and New Wave reduction is\nthat New Wave reductionists highlight the procedural aspect of how\nreductions are carried out\u2014or of how scientists may argue that\nreduction-relations are instantiated, whereas Nagel was mostly\nconcerned with questions regarding the relation that is so discovered.\nHow scientists may arrive the truth of bridge-principles is a question\ndifferent from the question as to the nature of bridge-principles.\n",
