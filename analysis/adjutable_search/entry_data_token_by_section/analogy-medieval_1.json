Problems in Logic, Theology, and Metaphysics\n\nIn order to understand how the theory of analogy arose we have to bear\nin mind the history of education in the Latin-speaking western part of\nEurope. During the so-called dark ages, learning was largely confined\nto monasteries, and people had access to very few texts from the\nancient world. This situation had changed dramatically by the\nbeginning of the thirteenth century. The first universities (Bologna,\nParis, Oxford) had been established, and the recovery of the writings\nof Aristotle supplemented by the works of Islamic philosophers was\nwell under way.\n\nOne source for the theory of analogy is the doctrine of equivocal\nterms found in logic texts. Until the early twelfth century, the only\nparts of Aristotle\u2019s logic to be available in Latin were the\nCategories and On Interpretation, supplemented by a\nfew other works including the monographs and commentaries of Boethius.\nThe Categories opens with a brief characterization of terms\nused equivocally, such as \u2018animal\u2019 used of real human\nbeings and pictured human beings, and terms used univocally, such as\n\u2018animal\u2019 used of human beings and oxen. In the first case,\nthe spoken term is the same but there are two distinct significates or\nintellectual conceptions; in the second case, both the spoken term and\nthe significate are the same. We should note that equivocal terms\ninclude homonyms (two words with the same form but different senses,\ne.g., \u2018pen\u2019), polysemous words (one word with two or more\nsenses), and, for medieval thinkers, proper names shared by different\npeople. By the mid-twelfth century the rest of Aristotle\u2019s logic\nhad been recovered, including the Sophistical Refutations in\nwhich Aristotle discusses three types of equivocation and how these\ncontribute to fallacies in logic. For writers throughout the later\nmiddle ages, the discussion of analogical terms was fitted into the\nframework of univocal and equivocal terms provided by Aristotle and\nhis commentators. We will return to this below.\n\nTwelfth-century theology is another important source for the doctrine\nof analogy, for twelfth-century theologians such as Gilbert of\nPoitiers and Alan of Lille explored the problem of divine language in\ndepth. Their work initially sprang from works on the Trinity by\nAugustine and Boethius. These authors insisted that God is absolutely\nsimple, so that no distinctions can be made between God\u2019s\nessence and his existence, or between one perfection, such as\ngoodness, and another, such as wisdom, or, more generally, between God\nand his properties. New attention was also paid to Greek theologians,\nespecially Pseudo-Dionysius. These theologians insisted on God\u2019s\nabsolute transcendence, and on what came to be called negative\ntheology. We cannot affirm anything positive about God, because no\naffirmation can be appropriate to a transcendent being. It is better\nto deny properties of God, saying for instance that he is not good\n(i.e., in the human sense), and still better to say that God is not\nexistent but super-existent, not substance but super-substantial, not\ngood but super-good. These theological doctrines raised the general\nproblem of how we can speak meaningfully of God at all, but they also\nraised a number of particular problems. Must we say that \u201cGod is\njustice\u201d means the same as \u201cGod is just\u201d? Must we\nsay that \u201cGod is just\u201d means the same as \u201cGod is\ngood\u201d? Can we say that God is just and that Peter is just as\nwell? For our purposes, this last question is the most important, for\nit raises the question of one word used of two different\nrealities.\n\nThe third source for doctrines of analogy is metaphysics. The first\npart of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics had been translated by\nthe mid-twelfth century, though the full text was recovered only\ngradually. One crucial text is found in Metaphysics 4.2\n(1003a33\u201335): \u201cThere are many senses (multis\nmodis) in which being (ens) can be said, but they are\nrelated to one central point (ad unum), one definite kind of\nthing, and are not equivocal. Everything which is healthy is related\nto health\u2026. and everything which is medical to\nmedicine\u2026.\u201d In this text, Aristotle raises the general\nproblem of the word \u2018being\u2019 and its different senses, and\nhe also introduces what is known as pros hen equivocation or\nfocal meaning, the idea that different senses may be unified through a\nrelationship to one central sense. Another foundational text is from\nAvicenna\u2019s Metaphysics, also translated into Latin\nduring the twelfth century, where he writes that being (ens)\nis neither a genus nor a predicate predicated equally of all its\nsubordinates, but rather a notion (intentio) in which they\nagree according to the prior and the posterior. As we shall see below,\nthis reference to the prior and the posterior is particularly\nimportant.\n\nSome further background for the development of doctrines of analogy is\nprovided by Aristotle\u2019s discussion of scientific reasoning in\nhis Posterior Analytics, first commented on in the 1220s by\nRobert Grosseteste. One important issue was how analogical relations\nmight be used to find a way of referring to things which did not\nbelong to one genus and lacked a common name. A popular example\nthroughout the middle ages involved Aristotle\u2019s account of the\nrelation between the \u2018bone\u2019 of a cuttlefish, a spine, and\na normal bone (Posterior Analytics, 14.2, 98a20\u201323),\nthough there was some disagreement about the type of analogy involved.\nEven more important was Aristotle\u2019s view that scientific\nreasoning requires demonstrative syllogisms, which, in order to be\nlogically valid, must have a middle term that avoids the fallacy of\nequivocation. How far analogical terms could fill that role was a\nfrequent topic of discussion and controversy. In the thirteenth\ncentury, in his questions on Aristotle\u2019s Physics,\nGeoffrey of Aspall remarked that analogy did not rule out univocity or\nprevent a subject from being one, while in the early fourteenth\ncentury, Scotus preferred to preserve unity by abandoning the use of\nanalogical terms. In the late fifteenth century Cajetan strongly\nsupported the claim that analogical terms could function as middle\nterms. None of these authors suggested that natural science and\ntheology could appeal to analogical relationships to produce\nprobabilistic rather than demonstrative arguments.\n",
