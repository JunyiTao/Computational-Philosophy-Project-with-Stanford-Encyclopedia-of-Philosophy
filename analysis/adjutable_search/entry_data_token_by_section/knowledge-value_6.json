    "main_text": "Weak and Strong Conceptions of Knowledge\n7. Weak and Strong Conceptions of Knowledge\n\nLaurence BonJour argues that reflecting on the value of knowledge\nleads us to reject a prevailing trend in epistemology over the past\nseveral decades, namely, fallibilism, or what BonJour calls the\n\u201cweak conception\u201d of knowledge.\n\nBonJour outlines four traditional assumptions about knowledge,\nunderstood as roughly justified true belief, which he\n\u201cbroadly\u201d endorses (BonJour 2010: 58\u20139). First,\nknowledge is a \u201cvaluable and desirable cognitive state\u201d\nindicative of \u201cfull cognitive success\u201d. Any acceptable\ntheory of knowledge must \u201cmake sense of\u201d knowledge\u2019s\nimportant value. Second, knowledge is \u201can all or nothing matter,\nnot a matter of degree\u201d. There is no such thing as degrees of\nknowing: either you know or you don\u2019t. Third, epistemic\njustification comes in degrees, from weak to strong. Fourth, epistemic\njustification is essentially tied to \u201clikelihood or probability\nof truth\u201d, such that the strength of justification covaries with\nhow likely it makes the truth of the belief in question.\n\nOn this traditional approach, we are invited to think of justification\nas measured by how probable the belief is given the reasons\nor evidence you have. One convenient way to measure probability is to\nuse the decimals in the interval [0, 1]. A probability of 0 means that\nthe claim is guaranteed to be false. A probability of 1 means that the\nclaim is guaranteed to be true. A probability of .5 means that the\nclaim is just as likely to be true as it is to be false. The question\nthen becomes, how probable must your belief be for it to be\nknowledge?\n\nObviously it must be greater than .5. But how much greater? Suppose we\nsay that knowledge requires a probability of 1\u2014that is,\nknowledge requires our justification or reasons to guarantee\nthe truth of the belief. Call such reasons conclusive\nreasons.\n\nThe strong conception of knowledge says knowledge requires\nconclusive reasons. We can motivate the strong conception as follows.\nIf the aim of belief is truth, then it makes sense that knowledge\nwould require conclusive reasons, because conclusive reasons guarantee\nthat belief\u2019s aim is achieved. The three components of the\ntraditional view of knowledge thus fit together\n\u201ccohesively\u201d to explain why knowledge is valued as a state\nof full cognitive success.\n\nBut all is not well with the strong conception, or so philosophers\nhave claimed over the past several decades. The strong conception\nseems to entail that we know nearly nothing at all about the material\nworld outside of our own minds or about the past. For we could have\nhad all the reasons we do in fact have, even if the world around us or\nthe past had been different. (Think of Descartes\u2019s evil genius.)\nThis conflicts with commonsense and counts against the strong\nconception. But what is the alternative?\n\nThe alternative is that knowledge requires reasons that make the\nbelief very likely true, but needn\u2019t guarantee it. This is the\nweak conception of knowledge. Most epistemologists accept the\nweak conception of knowledge. But BonJour asks a challenging question:\nwhat is the \u201cmagic\u201d level of probability required by\nknowledge? BonJour then argues that a satisfactory answer to this\nquestion isn\u2019t forthcoming. For any point short of 1 would seem\narbitrary. Why should we pick that point exactly? The same\ncould be said for a vague range that includes points short of\n1\u2014why, exactly, should the vague range extend roughly that\nfar but not further? This leads to an even deeper problem for the\nweak conception. It brings into doubt the value of knowledge. Can\nknowledge really be valuable if it is arbitrarily defined?\n\nA closely related problem for the weak conception presents itself.\nSuppose for the sake of argument that we settle on .9 as the required\nlevel of probability. Suppose further that you believe Q and\nyou believe R, that Q and R are both true,\nand that you have reached the .9 threshold for each. Thus the weak\nconception entails that you know Q, and you know R.\nIntuitively, if you know Q and you also know R, then\nyou\u2019re automatically in a position to know the conjunction\nQ & R. But the weak conception cannot sustain\nthis judgment. For the probability of the conjunction of two\nindependent claims, such as Q and R, equals the\nproduct of their probabilities. (This is the special conjunction rule\nfrom probability theory.) In this case, the probability of Q\n= .9 and the probability of R = .9. So the probability of the\nconjunction (Q & R) = .9 \u00d7 .9 = .81, which\nfalls short of the required .9. So the weak conception of knowledge\nalong with a law of probability entail that you\u2019re automatically\nnot in a position to know the conjunction (Q &\nR). BonJour considers this to be \u201can intuitively\nunacceptable result\u201d, because after all,\n\n\nwhat is the supposed state of knowledge really worth, if even the\nsimplest inference from two pieces of knowledge [might] not lead to\nfurther knowledge? (BonJour 2010: 63)\n\n\nBonJour concludes that the weak conception fails to explain the value\nof knowledge, and thus that the strong conception must be true. He\nrecognizes that this implies that we don\u2019t know most of the\nthings we ordinarily say and think that we know. He explains this\naway, however, partly on grounds that knowledge is the norm of\npractical reasoning, which creates strong \u201cpractical\npressure\u201d to confabulate or exaggerate in claiming to know\nthings, so that we can view ourselves as reasoning and acting\nappropriately, even though usually the best we can do is to\napproximate appropriate action and reasoning.
