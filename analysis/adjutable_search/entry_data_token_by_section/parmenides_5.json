Some Principal Types of Interpretation\n\nWhile Parmenides is generally recognized as having played a major role\nin the development of ancient Greek natural philosophy and\nmetaphysics, fundamental disagreement persists about the upshot of his\nphilosophy and thus about the precise nature of his influence.\nSections 3.1 through 3.3 of what follows describe in brief outline the\ntypes of interpretation that have played the most prominent roles in\nthe development of broader narratives for the history of early Greek\nphilosophy. These sections do not purport to present a comprehensive\ntaxonomy of modern interpretations, nor do they make any attempt to\nreference all the representatives and variants of the principal types\nof interpretation here described. They are not meant to be a history\nof modern Parmenides interpretation, as worthy and fascinating a topic\nas that is. Since some advocates of the interpretations outlined in\nsections 3.1 to 3.3 have claimed to find ancient authority for their\nviews via selective appeal to certain facets of the ancient Parmenides\nreception, it will also be worthwhile indicating what was in fact the\nprevailing view of Parmenides in antiquity. After doing so in section\n3.4, the final section of this article will outline a type of\ninterpretation that takes the prevailing ancient view more seriously\nwhile responding to at least one major problem it encounters in the\nfragments.\n\nIf one wishes to adjudicate among the various types of interpretation,\none may start by recognizing some of the requirements upon a\nsuccessful interpretation, or an interpretation offering a\nhistorically plausible account of Parmenides\u2019 thought in its\nplace and time. A successful interpretation must take account of\nadvances in the understanding of the text and transmission of the\nfragments of Parmenides\u2019 poem, such as Theodor Ebert\u2019s\nidentification of a transposition in fr. 8 (Ebert 1989) and the\nresults of Leonardo Tar\u00e1n\u2019s reexamination of the\nmanuscripts of Simplicius\u2019s commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics (Tar\u00e1n 1987). A successful interpretation\nshould attend to the fr. 1 proem\u2019s indications of the\npoem\u2019s cultural context. It should attend to the poem\u2019s\nepistemology as well as to its logical and metaphysical dimensions.\nPerhaps most importantly, it should take full and proper account of\nParmenides\u2019 cosmology (and not try to explain it away or else\nsimply ignore it). Attention in recent years to some of the most\ninnovative features of the cosmology have confirmed what should have\nbeen evident in any case, namely, that the cosmology that originally\ncomprised the greater part of his poem is Parmenides\u2019 own\nexplanation of the world\u2019s origins and operation (see especially\nMourelatos 2013, Graham 2013, and Mansfeld 2015). A successful\ninterpretation must\u00a0explain the relation between the two major\nphases of the goddess\u2019s revelation so that the existence of what\nis described in one is compatible with the existence of what is\ndescribed in the other. To this end, it should avoid attributing to\nParmenides views that are patently anachronistic or, worse, views that\ncannot be coherently asserted or maintained. A successful\ninterpretation also needs to attend carefully to the structure of\nParmenides\u2019 argumentation in the path of conviction and to\nfollow it through to the end without lapsing into understanding his\nclaims that what is is \"ungenerated and deathless,/ whole and uniform,\nand still and perfect\" (fr. 8.3\u20134) as mere metaphors.\n",
