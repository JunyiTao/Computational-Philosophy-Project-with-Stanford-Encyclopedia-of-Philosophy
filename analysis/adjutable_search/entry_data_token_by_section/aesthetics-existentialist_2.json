Art as revelation of the world\n\n\nSartre draws a basic aesthetic implication from the thesis that\nmeaning in the world depends on acts of consciousness: the fundamental\naim of the work of art is to deliberately and consistently exert this\nuniquely human quality to introduce meaningful order and regularities\ninto the world. Whereas in the \u201cnatural attitude\u201d this\nhappens without the agent\u2019s awareness (in the form of natural\nperception, folk and scientific knowledge), in artistic practice\nthe order, regularities, perspectives, and meaningful relationships are\nformalised, emphasised, systematised, and wilfully arranged. The\nsimultaneous effect is to \u201creveal\u201d significant features of\nthe world and to gain a reflexive sense of being\nrevealers of the world and \u2018manifesting\u2019 it. Thus, our\nsense of freedom is tremendously increased:\n\n\nOne of the chief motives of artistic creation is certainly the need\nof feeling that we are essential in relationship to the world. If I fix\non canvas or in writing a certain aspect of the fields or the sea or a\nlook on someone\u2019s face which I have disclosed, I am conscious of\nhaving produced them by condensing relationships, by introducing order\nwhere there was none, by imposing the unity of mind on the diversity of\nthings (Sartre 1948a, 27).\n\n\nThus the first aspect of aesthetic pleasure is this double\n\u201cjoy\u201d (Sartre 1948a, 41) of \u201cdisclosing\u201d the\nworld and fully appropriating the unique power to do so, becoming aware\nand exercising our radical freedom. This first aspect of aesthetic\npleasure can be called \u201cmetaphysical\u201d, since it arises from\nthe fundamental relation between humans and the world (Howells 1988).\n\n\nIndeed, such is the metaphysical reach of human freedom that every\nattempt to disclose a portion of the world tends to aim for the\ndisclosure of the \u201ctotality\u201d of beings. This is because (as\nHusserl already insisted) the most partial or minute act of\nperception entails a reference to a broader horizon of future potential\nperceptions. Many existentialist writers have stressed this primordial,\nmetaphysical function of the work of art as a partial revealing that\naims to uncover the totality of Being. This idea is found, most\nnotably, in Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s defence of the metaphysical\nnovel (de Beauvoir 1946, 1965, 73; see also, Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\nreflections in his review of de Beauvoir\u2019s first novel,\n1945c).\n\n\nSuch an intimate link between metaphysics and art explains why\nexistentialists often place certain artists on a level equal or\nsuperior to the philosophers: Camus with Dostoievski, Marcel with Bach,\nMerleau-Ponty with C\u00e9zanne, Sartre and de Beauvoir with Faulkner\nand Kafka. It also partly explains why most existentialist philosophers\nwere equally, or in fact more, active as creative writers. According to\nthem, metaphysical inquiry and\nartistic practice share a fundamental aim: both are ways of revealing to human beings their own\nfreedom and responsibility.\n",
