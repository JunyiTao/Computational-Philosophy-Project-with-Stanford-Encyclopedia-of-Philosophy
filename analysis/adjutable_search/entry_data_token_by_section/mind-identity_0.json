    "main_text": "Historical Antecedents\n1. Historical Antecedents\n\n\nThe identity theory as I understand it here goes back to U.T. Place\nand Herbert Feigl in the 1950s. Historically philosophers and\nscientists, for example Leucippus, Hobbes, La Mettrie, and d'Holbach,\nas well as Karl Vogt who, following Pierre-Jean-Georges Cabanis, made\nthe preposterous remark (perhaps not meant to be taken too seriously)\nthat the brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile, have\nembraced materialism. However, here I shall date interest in the\nidentity theory from the pioneering papers \u2018Is Consciousness a\nBrain Process?\u2019 by U.T. Place (Place 1956) and H.  Feigl\n\u2018The \"Mental\" and the \"Physical\"\u2019 (Feigl 1958).\nNevertheless mention should be made of suggestions by Rudolf Carnap\n(1932, p. 127), H. Reichenbach (1938) and M. Schlick (1935).\nReichenbach said that mental events can be identified by the\ncorresponding stimuli and responses much as the (possibly unknown)\ninternal state of a photo-electric cell can be identified by the\nstimulus (light falling on it) and response (electric current flowing)\nfrom it. In both cases the internal states can be physical states.\nHowever Carnap did regard the identity as a linguistic recommendation\nrather than as asserting a question of fact. See his \u2018Herbert\nFeigl on Physicalism\u2019 in Schilpp (1963), especially p. 886. The\npsychologist E.G. Boring (1933) may well have been the first to use\nthe term \u2018identity theory\u2019. See Place (1990).\n\n\nPlace's very original and pioneering paper was written after\ndiscussions at the University of Adelaide with J.J.C. Smart and C.B.\nMartin. For recollections of Martin's contributions to the discussion\nsee Place (1989) \u2018Low Claim Assertions\u2019 in Heil (1989).\nSmart at the time argued for a behaviourist position in which mental\nevents were elucidated purely in terms of hypothetical propositions\nabout behaviour, as well as first person reports of experiences which\nGilbert Ryle regarded as \u2018avowals\u2019. Avowals were thought of\nas mere pieces of behaviour, as if saying that one had a pain was just\ndoing a sophisticated sort of wince. Smart saw Ryle's theory as\nfriendly to physicalism though that was not part of Ryle's motivation.\nSmart hoped that the hypotheticals would ultimately be explained by\nneuroscience and cybernetics. Being unable to refute Place, and\nrecognizing the unsatisfactoriness of Ryle's treatment of inner\nexperience, to some extent recognized by Ryle himself (Ryle 1949, p.\n240), Smart soon became converted to Place's view (Smart 1959). In this\nhe was also encouraged and influenced by Feigl's \u2018\"The Mental\"\nand the \"Physical\" \u2019 (Feigl 1958, 1967). Feigl's wide ranging\ncontribution covered many problems, including those connected with\nintentionality, and he introduced the useful term \u2018nomological\ndanglers\u2019 for the dualists' supposed mental-physical\ncorrelations. They would dangle from the nomological net of physical\nscience and should strike one as implausible excrescences on the fair\nface of science. Feigl (1967) contains a valuable\n\u2018Postscript\u2019.\n",
