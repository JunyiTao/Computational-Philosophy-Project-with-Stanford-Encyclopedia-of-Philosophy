    "main_text": "Individualism and Anti-Individualism\n4. Individualism and Anti-Individualism\n\nConsider\n\n\nFourth Big Question: Should testimonial justification be\nunderstood individualistically, or anti- individualistically?\n\n\nSome epistemologists endorse\n\n\nIndividualism: A complete account of testimonial\njustification can be given by appealing to features that only have to\ndo with the hearer.\n\n\nOther epistemologists endorse\n\n\nAnti-Individualism: A complete account of testimonial\njustification cannot be given by only appealing to features that have\nto do with the hearer.\n\n\nFor instance, according to some Anti-Individualists, acquiring\ntestimonial justification involves features having to do with both the\nhearer and the speaker. And according to other Anti-Individualists,\nacquiring testimonial justification involves features having to do\nwith both the hearer and the other speakers in the hearer\u2019s\nlocal environment. For various defenses of Anti-Individualism, see,\ne.g., Graham (2000b), Lackey (2008), Goldberg (2010a), Kallestrup and\nPritchard (2012), Gerken (2013), Pritchard (2015), and Palermos\n(forthcoming).\n\n(Note: In formulating these two views, I am being deliberately\nopen-ended about how the \u201cfeatures\u201d in question should be\nunderstood. As we will see below, this is because the debate between\nIndividualists and Anti-Individualists cuts across the other debates\nabout testimonial justification that we have explored above.\nConsequently, different members of each camp will want to give\nimportantly different takes on what these features amount to.)\n",
