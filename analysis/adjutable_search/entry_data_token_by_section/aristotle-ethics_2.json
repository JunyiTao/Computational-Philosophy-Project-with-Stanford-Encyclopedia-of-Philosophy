    "main_text": "Methodology || Traditional Virtues and the Skeptic\n3.1 Traditional Virtues and the Skeptic\n\nA common complaint about Aristotle\u2019s attempt to defend his\nconception of happiness is that his argument is too general to show\nthat it is in one\u2019s interest to possess any of the particular\nvirtues as they are traditionally conceived. Suppose we grant, at\nleast for the sake of argument, that doing anything well, including\nliving well, consists in exercising certain skills; and let us call\nthese skills, whatever they turn out to be, virtues. Even so, that\npoint does not by itself allow us to infer that such qualities as\ntemperance, justice, courage, as they are normally understood, are\nvirtues. They should be counted as virtues only if it can be shown\nthat actualizing precisely these skills is what happiness consists in.\nWhat Aristotle owes us, then, is an account of these traditional\nqualities that explains why they must play a central role in any\nwell-lived life.\n\nBut perhaps Aristotle disagrees, and refuses to accept this\nargumentative burden. In one of several important methodological\nremarks he makes near the beginning of the Nicomachean\nEthics, he says that in order to profit from the sort of study he\nis undertaking, one must already have been brought up in good habits\n(1095b4\u20136). The audience he is addressing, in other words,\nconsists of people who are already just, courageous, and generous; or,\nat any rate, they are well on their way to possessing these virtues.\nWhy such a restricted audience? Why does he not address those who have\nserious doubts about the value of these traditional qualities, and who\ntherefore have not yet decided to cultivate and embrace them?\n\nAddressing the moral skeptic, after all, is the project Plato\nundertook in the Republic: in Book I he rehearses an argument\nto show that justice is not really a virtue, and the remainder of this\nwork is an attempt to rebut this thesis. Aristotle\u2019s project\nseems, at least on the surface, to be quite different. He does not\nappear to be addressing someone who has genuine doubts about the value\nof justice or kindred qualities. Perhaps, then, he realizes how little\ncan be accomplished, in the study of ethics, to provide it with a\nrational foundation. Perhaps he thinks that no reason can be given for\nbeing just, generous, and courageous. These are qualities one learns\nto love when one is a child, and having been properly habituated, one\nno longer looks for or needs a reason to exercise them. One can show,\nas a general point, that happiness consists in exercising some skills\nor other, but that the moral skills of a virtuous person are what one\nneeds is not a proposition that can be established on the basis of\nargument.\n\nThis is not the only way of reading the Ethics, however. For\nsurely we cannot expect Aristotle to show what it is about the\ntraditional virtues that makes them so worthwhile until he has fully\ndiscussed the nature of those virtues. He himself warns us that his\ninitial statement of what happiness is should be treated as a rough\noutline whose details are to be filled in later (1098a20\u201322).\nHis intention in Book I of the Ethics is to indicate in a\ngeneral way why the virtues are important; why particular\nvirtues\u2014courage, justice, and the like\u2014are components of\nhappiness is something we should be able to better understand only at\na later point.\n\nIn any case, Aristotle\u2019s assertion that his audience must\nalready have begun to cultivate the virtues need not be taken to mean\nthat no reasons can be found for being courageous, just, and generous.\nHis point, rather, may be that in ethics, as in any other study, we\ncannot make progress towards understanding why things are as they are\nunless we begin with certain assumptions about what is the case.\nNeither theoretical nor practical inquiry starts from scratch. Someone\nwho has made no observations of astronomical or biological phenomena\nis not yet equipped with sufficient data to develop an understanding\nof these sciences. The parallel point in ethics is that to make\nprogress in this sphere we must already have come to enjoy doing what\nis just, courageous, generous and the like. We must experience these\nactivities not as burdensome constraints, but as noble, worthwhile,\nand enjoyable in themselves. Then, when we engage in ethical inquiry,\nwe can ask what it is about these activities that makes them\nworthwhile. We can also compare these goods with other things that are\ndesirable in themselves\u2014pleasure, friendship, honor, and so\non\u2014and ask whether any of them is more desirable than the\nothers. We approach ethical theory with a disorganized bundle of likes\nand dislikes based on habit and experience; such disorder is an\ninevitable feature of childhood. But what is not inevitable is that\nour early experience will be rich enough to provide an adequate basis\nfor worthwhile ethical reflection; that is why we need to have been\nbrought up well. Yet such an upbringing can take us only so far. We\nseek a deeper understanding of the objects of our childhood\nenthusiasms, and we must systematize our goals so that as adults we\nhave a coherent plan of life. We need to engage in ethical theory, and\nto reason well in this field, if we are to move beyond the low-grade\nform of virtue we acquired as children.\n",
