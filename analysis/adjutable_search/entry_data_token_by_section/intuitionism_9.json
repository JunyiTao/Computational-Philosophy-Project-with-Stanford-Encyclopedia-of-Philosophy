    "main_text": "Mathematics || The bar theorem\n3.6 The bar theorem\n\nBrouwer introduced choice sequences and the continuity axioms to\ncapture the intuitionistic continuum, but these principles alone do\nnot suffice to recover that part of traditional analysis that Brouwer\nconsidered intuitionistically sound, such as the theorem that every\ncontinuous real function on a closed interval is uniformly continuous.\nFor this reason Brouwer proved the so-called bar theorem. It is a\nclassically valid statement, but the proof Brouwer gave is by many\nconsidered to be no proof at all since it uses an assumption on the\nform of proofs for which no rigorous argument is provided. This is the\nreason that the bar theorem is also referred to as the bar principle.\n\n\nThe most famous consequence of the bar theorem is the fan theorem,\nwhich suffices to prove the aforementioned theorem on uniform\ncontinuity, and which will be treated first. Both the fan and the bar\ntheorem allow the intuitionist to use induction along certain\nwell-founded sets of objects called spreads. A spread is the\nintuitionistic analogue of a set, and captures the idea of infinite\nobjects as ever growing and never finished. A spread is essentially a\ncountably branching tree labelled with natural numbers or other finite\nobjects and containing only infinite paths.\n\nA fan is a finitely branching spread, and the fan principle\nexpresses a form of compactness that is classically equivalent to\nK\u00f6nig\u2019s lemma, the classical proof of which is unacceptable\nfrom the intuitionistic point of view. The principle states that for\nevery fan \\(T\\) in which every branch at some point satisfies a\nproperty \\(A\\), there is a uniform bound on the depth at which this\nproperty is met. Such a property is called a bar for\n\\(T\\). \n\n\\[\\tag{\\({\\bf FAN}\\)}\n\\forall \\alpha \\in T\\exists n A(\\alpha(\\overline{n})) \\rightarrow \n\\exists m \\forall \\alpha \\in T \\exists n \\leq m A(\\alpha(\\overline{n})).\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(\\alpha \\in T\\) means that \\(\\alpha\\) is a branch of \\(T\\). The\nprinciple FAN suffices to prove the theorem mentioned\nabove: \n\nTheorem (FAN) Every continuous real\nfunction on a closed interval is uniformly continuous.\n\n\nBrouwer\u2019s justification for the fan theorem is his bar principle\nfor the universal spread: \n\n\\[\\tag{\\({\\bf BI}\\)}\n\\begin{align}\n& [\\forall\\alpha\\forall n \\big( A(\\alpha(\\overline{n})) \\vee \\neg A(\\alpha(\\overline{n})) \\big)\n \\wedge \\forall\\alpha\\exists n A(\\alpha(\\overline{n}))\\ \\wedge\\\\\n&\\quad \\forall\\alpha\\forall n \\big( A(\\alpha(\\overline{n})) \\rightarrow\n B(\\alpha(\\overline{n})) \\big)\\ \\wedge \\\\\n&\\quad \\forall\\alpha\\forall n \\big(\n \\forall mB(\\alpha(\\overline{n})\\cdot m) \\rightarrow\n B(\\alpha(\\overline{n})) \\big)] \\rightarrow B(\\varepsilon).\n\\end{align} \n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(\\varepsilon\\) stands for the empty sequence, \\(\\cdot\\) for\nconcatenation, BI for Bar Induction, and the\nsubscript D refers to the decidability of the\npredicate \\(A\\). The bar principle provides intuitionism with an\ninduction principle for trees; it expresses a well-foundedness\nprinciple for spreads with respect to decidable properties. Extensions\nof this principle in which the decidability requirement is weakened\ncan be extracted from Brouwer\u2019s work but will be omitted here.\nContinuity and the bar principle are sometimes captured in one axiom\ncalled the bar continuity axiom.\n\nThere is a close connection between the bar principle and the\nneighborhood functions mentioned in the section on continuity axioms.\nLet \\(\\mathcal{IK}\\) be the inductively defined class of neighborhood\nfunctions, consisting of all constant non-zero sequences \\(\\lambda\nm.n+1\\), and such that if \\(f(0)=0\\) and \\(\\lambda m.f(x\\cdot m)\\in\n\\mathcal{IK}\\) for all \\(x\\), then \\(f \\in \\mathcal{IK}\\). The\nstatement \\(\\mathcal{K}=\\mathcal{IK}\\), that is, the statement that\nthe neighborhood functions can be generated inductively, is equivalent\nto BID. \n\nBrouwer\u2019s proof of the bar theorem is remarkable in that it uses\nwell-ordering properties of hypothetical proofs. It is based\non the assumption that any proof that a property A on\nsequences is a bar can be decomposed into a canonical proof\nthat is well-ordered. Although it is classically valid,\nBrouwer\u2019s proof of the principle shows that the reason for\naccepting it as a valid principle in intuitionism differs\nfundamentally from the argument supporting its acceptability in\nclassical mathematics.\n",
