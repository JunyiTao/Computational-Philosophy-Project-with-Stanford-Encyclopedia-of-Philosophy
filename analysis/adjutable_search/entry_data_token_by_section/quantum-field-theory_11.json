In the context of quantum mechanics,\nSchr\u00f6dinger, Dirac, Jordan and von Neumann realized that\nHeisenberg\u2019s matrix mechanics and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave\nmechanics are just two (unitarily) equivalent representations of the\nsame underlying abstract structure, i.e., an abstract Hilbert space\n\\(\\mathcal{H}\\) and linear operators\nacting on this space. We are merely dealing with two different ways\nfor representing the same physical reality, and it is possible to\nswitch between these different representations by means of a unitary\ntransformation, i.e., an operation that is analogous to an innocuous\nrotation of the frame of reference.\nRepresentations of some given algebra or group\nare sets of mathematical objects, like numbers, rotations or more\nabstract transformations (e.g., differential operators) together with a\nbinary operation (e.g., addition or multiplication) that combines any\ntwo elements of the algebra or group, such that the structure of the\nalgebra or group to be represented is preserved. This means that the\ncombination of any two elements in the representation space, say \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\),\nleads to a third element which corresponds to\nthe element that results when you combine the elements corresponding\nto \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nin the algebra or group that is represented. In\n1931 von Neumann gave a detailed proof (of a conjecture by Stone) that\nthe canonical commutation relations (CCRs) for position coordinates\nand their conjugate momentum coordinates in configuration space fix\nthe representation of these two sets of operators in Hilbert space up\nto unitary equivalence (von Neumann\u2019s uniqueness theorem). This\nmeans that the specification of the purely algebraic CCRs suffices to\ndescribe a particular physical system.\n\nIn quantum field theory, however, von\nNeumann\u2019s uniqueness theorem loses its validity since here one\nis dealing with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Now one is\nconfronted with a multitude of unitarily inequivalent representations (UIRs)\n of the CCRs and it is not obvious what\nthis means physically and how one should cope with it. Since the\ntroublesome inequivalent representations of the CCRs that arise in QFT\nare all irreducible their inequivalence is not\ndue to the fact that some are reducible while others are not (a\nrepresentation is reducible if there is an\ninvariant subrepresentation, i.e., a subset which alone represent the\nCCRs already). Since unitarily inequivalent representations seem to describe different physical states of affairs it would no longer be legitimate to simply choose\nthe most convenient representation, just like choosing the most\nconvenient frame of reference. In principle all but one of the UIRs\ncould be physically irrelevant, i.e., mathematical artefacts of a\nredundant formalism. However, it seems that at least some irreducible\nrepresentations of the CCRs are inequivalent and\nphysically relevant.\n\nThese considerations motivate the algebraic point of view that\nalgebras of observables rather than observables\nthemselves in a particular representation should be taken as the basic\nentities in the mathematical description of QFT, so that the\nabove-mentioned problems are to some degree avoided from the outset.\nHowever, obviously this cannot just be the end of the story. Even if\nUIRs are not basic, it is still necessary to say what the availability\nof different UIRs means, physically and thereby ontologically.\n",
