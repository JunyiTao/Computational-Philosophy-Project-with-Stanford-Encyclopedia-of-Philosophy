There is no scope for chance in selecting the new\nbelief set. Clearly, this is not a realistic feature, but it makes the\nmodels much simpler and easier to handle, not least from a\ncomputational point of view. In indeterministic belief\nchange, the subjection of a specified belief set to a specified input\nhas more than one admissible outcome.\n\nIndeterministic operations can be constructed as sets of deterministic\noperations. Hence, given three revision operations \\(* , * '\\) and \\(*\n''\\) the set \\(\\{*\\), \\(* '\\), \\(*\n''\\)\\(\\}\\) can be used as an indeterministic\noperation. The success condition is simply: \n\n\\[\nK\\{* , * ', * ''\\}p \\in \\{K* p, K* 'p, K* ''p\\}\n\\]\n\n\nLindstr\u00f6m and Rabinowicz (1991) constructed indeterministic\ncontraction by giving up the assumption that epistemic entrenchment\nsatisfies connectedness. This resulted in Grove\u2019s sphere systems\nwith \u201cfallbacks\u201d that are not linearly ordered but still\nall include the original belief set. Fazio and Baldi (2021) have used\nindeterministic contraction in an investigation of algebraic\ncounterparts to both the AGM model and some closely related models of\nbelief change.\n6.10 Operations for an extended language\n\nBelief revision theory has been almost exclusively developed within\nthe framework of classical sentential (truth-functional) logic. The\ninclusion of non-truthfunctional expressions into the language has\ninteresting and indeed drastic effects. In particular, this applies to\nconditional sentences.\n\nMany types of conditional sentences, such as counterfactual\nconditionals, cannot be adequately expressed with truth-functional\nimplication (material implication). Several formal interpretations of\nconditional sentences have been proposed. One of them, namely the\nRamsey test, is particularly well suited to the formal\nframework of belief revision. It is based on a suggestion by F. P.\nRamsey that has been further developed by Robert Stalnaker and others\n(Stalnaker 1968). The basic idea is that \u201cif \\(p\\) then\n\\(q\\)\u201d is taken to be believed if and only if \\(q\\) would be\nbelieved after revising the present belief state by \\(p\\). Let\n\\(p\\Rightarrow q\\) denote \u201cif \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)\u201d, or more\nprecisely: \u201cif \\(p\\) were the case, then \\(q\\) would be the\ncase\u201d. In order to treat conditional statements on par with\nstatements about actual facts, they will have to be included in the\nbelief set, thus:\n\nThe Ramsey test:\n\n\\((p\\Rightarrow q) \\in K\\) if and only if \\(q \\in K* p\\). \n\nHowever, inclusion in the belief set of conditionals that satisfy the\nRamsey test will require radical changes in the logic of belief\nchange. As one example of this, contraction cannot then satisfy the\ninclusion postulate \\((K\\div p \\subseteq K)\\). The reason for this is\nthat contraction typically provides support for conditional sentences\nthat were not supported by the original belief state. This can be seen\nfrom the following example:\n\nIf I give up my belief that John is mentally retarded, then I gain\nsupport for the conditional sentence \u201cIf John has lived 30 years\nin London, then John understands the English language.\u201d \n\nA famous impossibility theorem by Peter G\u00e4rdenfors (1986, 1987)\nshows that the Ramsey test is incompatible with a set of plausible\npostulates for revision. Several solutions to the impossibility\ntheorem have been put forward. One option is to reject the Ramsey test\nas a criterion for the validity of conditional sentences (Rott 1986).\nAnother, proposed by Isaac Levi, is to accept the test as a criterion\nof validity but deny that such conditional sentences should be\nincluded in the belief set when they are valid (Levi 1988.\nArl\u00f3-Costa 1995. Arl\u00f3-Costa and Levi 1996). Several\nother proposals have been put forward. However, it is fair to say that\noperations of AGM-style belief change have not yet been constructed\nthat are generally recognized as able to deal adequately with\nconditional or modal sentences.\n6.11 Resource-bounded belief change\n\nThe AGM model and most related models of belief change assume highly\nidealized reasoners who have unlimited cognitive capacities. Harman\n(1986) developed a set of rationality principles for resource-bounded\nepistemic agents. Wassermann (1999), Alechina (2006), Doyle (2013) and\nothers have developed models of belief change for agents with limited\ncognitive capacities. The use of finite belief bases (section 5) can\nbe seen as a way to avoid the operations on infinite belief sets that\nare standard in AGM. Operations on infinite sets can require infinite\nresources, which makes such operations impossible for agents with\nfinite resources.\n6.12 Changes in the strength of beliefs\n\nAn operation of change can raise or lower the position of a sentence\nin the ordering without affecting the belief set (but affecting how\nthe belief state responds to new inputs). An operation of\nimprovement, as proposed by Konieczny and P\u00e9rez (2008)\nincreases the plausibility of a non-believed sentence \\(p\\) by moving\nsome of the \\(p\\)-worlds to a higher position in the preference\nordering of worlds. Even if such a change does not lead to \\(p\\)\nbecoming a belief, its acceptance in later, additional operations can\nbe facilitated. \n\nAn operation of change can be so constructed that it adjusts the\nposition of the input sentence in an ordering to be the same as that\nof a reference sentence. This means that two sentences have to be\nspecified in the input: the (input) sentence to be moved and the\n(reference) sentence indicating its new position. Hans Rott (2007,\nOther Internet Resources) called such operators two-dimensional. John\nCantwell (1997) classified them as raising or\nlowering, depending on the direction of change. (See also\nFerm\u00e9 and Rott 2004 and Rott 2009.)\n6.13 Changes in norms and preferences\n\nThere are close parallels between changes in norms and changes in\nbeliefs. In order to apply a norm system with conflicting norms to a\nparticular situation, some of the norms may have to be ignored. The\nproblem how to prioritize among conflicting norms is similar to the\nselection of sentences for removal in belief contraction (Hansson and\nMakinson 1997). The AGM model was in fact partly the outcome of\nattempts to formalize changes in norms rather than beliefs\n(Alchourr\u00f3n and Makinson 1981). In spite of this, authors who\napply the AGM model to norms have found it in need of rather extensive\nmodifications to make it suitable for that purpose. Hence, in their\nmodel of changes in legislation, Governatori and Rotolo (2010)\nintroduced an explicit representation of time in order to account for\nphenomena such as retroactivity.\n\nA model of changes in preferences can be obtained by replacing the\nstandard AGM language by sentences of the form \\(p \\ge q\\)\n(\u201c\\(p\\) is at least as good as \\(q\\)\u201d) and their\ntruth-functional combinations. The adoption of a new preference can\nthen take the form of revision by such a preference sentence. Partial\nmeet contraction can be used, but some modifications of the AGM model\nseem to be necessary in applications to preferences (Hansson 1995,\nLang and van der Torre 2008, Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff and Hansson 2009).\n7. Iterated change\n\nThe preceding sections have only dealt with changes of one and the\nsame belief set or belief base. This is clearly a severe limitation. A\nrealistic model of belief change should allow for repeated (iterated)\nchanges, such as \\(K\\div p\\div q* r* s\\div t\\ldots\\) In other words,\noperations are needed that can contract or revise any belief set\n(belief base) by any sentence. Such operations are called\nglobal, in contrast to local operations that are\ndefined only for a single specified set.\n\nAn obvious way to obtain a global operation of partial meet\ncontraction would be to use the same selection function for all\nsets to be contracted. However, with the standard way to obtain a\npartial meet contraction from a selection function, this is not\npossible, due to the way selection functions treat the empty set. The\nway selection functions have traditionally been defined, if \\(A\\bot p\n= \\varnothing\\), then \\(\\gamma(A\\bot p ) = \\{A\\}\\). As a consequence\nof this, if \\(\\gamma\\) is a selection function for \\(A\\), and \\(A \\ne\nB\\), then \\(\\gamma\\) is not a selection function for \\(B\\). For let\n\\(A\\bot p = B\\bot p = \\varnothing\\). For \\(\\gamma\\) to be a function\nit must be the case that \\(\\gamma(A\\bot p) = \\gamma(B\\bot p)\\). For\n\\(\\gamma\\) to be a selection function for \\(A\\) it must be case that\n\\(\\gamma(A\\bot p) = \\{A\\}\\), and in order for it to be a selection\nfunction for \\(B\\) it must be the case that \\(\\gamma(B\\bot p) =\n\\{B\\}\\). Since \\(A \\ne B\\), this is impossible.\n\nThis can be solved if we rewrite the definition of partial meet\ncontraction as follows:\n\n\nAlternative definition of partial meet contraction:\n\n\\((1')\\) \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) \\subseteq K\\bot p\\), and if \\(K\\bot p \\ne\n\\varnothing\\), then \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) \\ne \\varnothing\\).\n\n\\((2')\\) \\(K\\div p = \\bigcap \\gamma(K\\bot p)\\), unless \\(\\gamma(K\\bot\np) = \\varnothing\\), in which case \\(K\\div p = K\\).\n\n\nAs applied to a single belief set \\(K\\), this definition is equivalent\nwith the original definition. Notably, it yields the same result as\nthe original definition even in the limiting case when \\(p\\) is a\ntautology, but it avoids using the selection function in this limiting\ncase. With this, slightly adjusted, definition, one and the same\nselection function can be used for all belief sets, and consequently\nwe can construct iterated change using only one, AGM-style, selection\nfunction. Since partial meet revision is definable from partial meet\ncontraction via the Levi identity, this means that we have global\noperations for both contraction and revision. This construction is so\ngeneral that it does not impose any new properties on contraction or\nrevision, i.e. no properties in addition to the usual AGM postulates\n(Hansson 2012). \n\nHowever, most of the discussion on iterated change has been based on\nthe assumption that such additional properties are plausible and\nindeed desirable. The so-called Darwiche-Pearl postulates for revision\nhave had a central role in these discussions (Darwiche and Pearl\n1997):\n\n\nIf \\(q \\vdash p\\), then \\((K * p) * q = K * q\\). (DP1)\n\nIf \\(q \\vdash \\neg p\\), then \\((K * p) * q = K * q\\). (DP2)\n\nIf \\(K * q \\vdash p\\), then \\((K * p) * q \\vdash p\\). (DP3)\n\nIf \\(K * q\\) \u22ac \\(\\neg p\\), then \\((K * p) * q\\) \u22ac \\(\\neg\np\\) (DP4) \n\n\nThe Darwiche-Pearl postulates express an intuition about the epistemic\nordering of possible worlds, namely that when we revise by a sentence\n\\(p\\), then the ordering among \\(p\\)-worlds should be unchanged, and\nso should the ordering among \\(\\neg p\\)-worlds. The change takes the\nform of a shift of the relative positions of these two parts of the\noriginal ordering of worlds. A large number of proposals for such\nshifts have been put forward, but opinions differ widely on the\nadequacy of these proposals.\n\nAbhaya Nayak (1994) has proposed a model of iterated belief change in\nwhich both the belief states and the inputs are binary relations that\nsatisfy the standard entrenchment postulates except Minimality. Inputs\nof this type may be seen as \u201cfragments\u201d of belief states,\nto be incorporated into the previous belief state. In the same vein,\nEduardo Ferm\u00e9 and Hans Rott (2004) have investigated belief\nrevision with inputs of the more general form: \u201caccept \\(q\\)\nwith a degree of plausibility that at least equals that of\n\\(p\\)\u201d. They call this revision by comparison. Belief\nstates are represented by entrenchment orderings. Hence, from an\nentrenchment ordering \\(\\le\\) and such a generalized input a new\nentrenchment ordering \\(\\le '\\) is obtained that contains the\ninformation needed to construct the new belief set. \n8. Alternative accounts\n\nIn spite of the dominant position of the AGM model and its close\nvariants, several other formal models of belief changes have been\nproposed.\n8.1 Learning theory\n\nIn belief revision theory, the focus is on consistency rather than\ntruthfulness. In contrast, learning theory is devoted to induction and\nthe attainment of true beliefs. A research question is represented as\na partition of the set of possible worlds, i.e. a distribution of all\npossible worlds into non-overlapping sets. The research question has\nbeen fully answered when it is known which of these partitions\ncontains the actual world. Information received by the agent\nsuccessively narrows down the set of partitions that may contain it.\nThe central issue is how to construct an inductive strategy, i.e. a\nstrategy for which investigations to perform and in what order, and\nhow to interpret them (Kelly 1999). Although this problem has\nconnections with belief revision, operations not satisfying the\nstandard AGM postulates have usually played a prominent role in the\ndiscussion. (Genin and Kelly 2019)\n8.2 Dynamic logics of belief change\n\nDynamic doxastic logic (DDL) was introduced by Krister Segerberg to\nrepresent an agent who has opinions about the external world and\nchanges these opinions upon receipt of new information. DDL makes use\nof epistemic modal operators of the type introduced by Hintikka\n(1962). The sentence \\(B_i p\\) denotes that the individual \\(i\\)\nbelieves that \\(p\\). When only one agent is under consideration, the\nsubscript can be deleted, and the operator \\(B\\) can be read \u201cit\nis believed that\u201d or \u201cthe agent believes that\u201d\n(Segerberg 1995, p. 536). \n\nThe formula \\(Bp\\) in DDL differs from the expression \\(p \\in K\\) of\nAGM in being a sentence in the same language as \\(p\\). This makes it\npossible to express in the object language that a sentence is\nbelieved. In this way, Segerberg attempted to develop belief revision\n\u201cas a generalization of ordinary Hintikka type doxastic\nlogic\u201d, whereas in contrast \u201cAGM is not really logic; it\nis a theory about theories\u201d (Segerberg 1999, p. 136). In the DDL\nframework it is possible to express beliefs about beliefs. The\nsentence \u201c\\(i\\) believes that \\(i\\) does not believe that\n\\(p\\)\u201d can be expressed as \\(B_i \\neg B_i p\\), whereas there is\nno way to express it in the AGM framework. \\(((p \\not\\in K_i) \\in\nK_i\\) is not a well-formed formula.)\n\nIn DDL, belief revision operations (expansion, revision, and\ncontraction) are expressed with dynamic modal operators, similar to\nthose used for program execution. (This element of DDL was present\nalso in previous publications by several authors. See Fuhrmann 1991;\nde Rijke 1994; van Benthem 1989 and 1995.) Segerberg used the\nfollowing notation:\n\n\n\\([\\div p]q\\)\n(\\(q\\) holds after contraction by \\(p)\\) \n\n\\([* p]q\\)\n(\\(q\\) holds after revision by \\(p)\\) \n\n\\([+ p]q\\)\n(\\(q\\) holds after expansion by \\(p)\\) \n\n\nThe combination of these two elements, belief operators and dynamic\noperators, results in a framework that differs from AGM in important\nways. (Leitgeb and Segerberg 2007, 169)\n\nLargely similar systems have been developed under the name of Dynamic\nEpistemic Logic, DEL (Plaza 1989; Baltag et al. 1998; van Ditmarsch et\nal. 2007; see the entry on\n dynamic-epistemic logic).\n A major difference between DDL and DEL is that the latter has mostly\nbeen studied in multiagent contexts. The most studied dynamics is that\nof the public announcement of some sentence (van Ditmarsch et al.\n2007). \n8.3 Descriptor revision\n\nDescriptor revision (Hansson 2017) is based on two major formal\nconstructions. One of them is a metalinguistic belief predicate\n\\(\\mathfrak{B}\\) that is applied to sentences of the object language.\n\\(\\mathfrak{B}p\\) denotes that the sentence \\(p\\) is believed, \\(\\neg\n\\mathfrak{B}p\\) that it is not believed, and \\(\\mathfrak{B}p\\vee\n\\mathfrak{B}q\\) that either \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) is believed. Such sentences\ncan be used to express the success conditions of belief change\noperations. Thus \\(\\mathfrak{B}p\\) is the success condition of\nrevision by \\(p\\), \\(\\neg \\mathfrak{B}p\\) that of contraction by \\(p\\)\nand \\(\\{\\neg \\mathfrak{B}p,\\neg \\mathfrak{B}q\\}\\) that of multiple\ncontraction by \\(\\{p,q\\}\\). Due to the versatility of descriptors we\nonly need one operation, denoted \\(\\circ\\). Hence, \\(K\\circ\n\\mathfrak{B}p\\) represents revision by \\(p\\) and \\(K \\circ \\neg\n\\mathfrak{B}p\\) contraction by \\(p\\). \n\nThe other major formal construction is a choice function (selection\nfunction) that operates directly on the set of potential outcomes of\nan operation. Hence, the operation \\(K \\circ \\mathfrak{B}p\\) is\nperformed by choosing one among the potential belief sets that contain\n\\(p\\) (presumably that which is most choiceworthy, or closest at\nhand). Operations based on these principles have been axiomatically\ncharacterized. Notably, the recovery postulate that creates problems\nin the AGM framework does not hold in the descriptor revision\nframework. The application of a choice function to potential belief\noutcomes is arguably more plausible than its application to possible\nworlds or remainders, since the latter two entities are logically\ninfinite (if the language is so), and therefore cognitively\ninaccessible.\n\nDescriptor revision makes it possible to investigate operations of\nchange more generally, and to discuss properties that can hold for\noperations with different types of the success conditions. Let \\(\n\\Psi\\) and \\( \\Xi\\) be descriptors, i.e. sets of sentences containing\nthe \\( \\mathfrak{B}\\) operator. Let \\(K \u22a9\\Psi\\) denote that\n\\(K\\) satisfies all the conditions in \\(\\Psi\\). Some examples of such\ngeneral properties of descriptor revision are:\n\nClosure:\n\n\\(K \\circ \\Psi = \\Cn(K \\circ \\Psi)\\)\n\nRelative success:\n\n\\(K \\circ \\Psi \u22a9 \\Psi\\) or \\( K \\circ \\Psi=K\\)\n\nRegularity:\n\nIf \\(K \\circ \\Xi \u22a9 \\Psi\\), then \\(K \\circ \\Psi \u22a9\n\\Psi\\)\n\nConfirmation:\n\nIf \\(K \u22a9\\Psi\\), then \\(K \\circ \\Psi=K)\\)\n\nCumulativity:\n\nIf \\(K \\circ \\Psi \u22a9\\Xi\\), then \\(K \\circ \\Psi = K \\circ\n(\\Psi\\cup\\Xi) \\)\n8.4 Bayesian models\n\nThe AGM model and other logical frameworks for belief revision are\nbased on a dichotomous approach to belief: either something is\nbelieved or it is not, in either case without any gradations. Beliefs\ncan be be more or less easily given up, and non-beliefs can be more or\nless easily turned into beliefs, but the very act of believing does\nnot admit of degrees. In contrast, probabilistic models of belief,\nusually based on some form of subjective Bayesianism, admit all\ndegrees between the strongest belief and the strongest disbelief.\nDichotomous and probabilistic models represent different features of\nbelief systems. It has proved to be difficult to construct a\nreasonably manageable model that covers both the logic-related and the\nprobabilistic properties of belief change. These difficulties are\nclosely connected with the lottery and preface paradoxes (Kyburg 1961;\nMakinson 1965).\n\nHowever, belief revision theory has turned out to be useful in dealing\nwith the problematic limiting case of conditional probabilities with a\ncondition that has probability zero. Insights from belief revision\ntheory have been used in the construction of non-standard models of\nprobabilities in which conditionalization can be performed also in\nthis limiting case (Makinson 2011).
