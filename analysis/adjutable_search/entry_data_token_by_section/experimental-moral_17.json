    "main_text": "Metaethics and Experimental Moral Philosophy || Moral Language\n4.3 Moral Language\n\nOne reason disagreement is a useful measure of objectivity is that the\nimpossibility of faultless disagreement is taken to be characteristic\nof questions concerning objective matters of fact. That is, while we\nmight concede the possibility of faultless disagreements about matters\nconcerning the deliciousness of foods or the merits of a sports team,\nwhen we disagree over moral issues, we think that there is a correct\nanswer and that therefore at least one disputant is getting things\nwrong (for a discussion of the analogy between food and morality, see\nLoeb 2003). To the extent that people judge a disagreement to be\nfaultless, we might think that they are evincing a kind of\nanti-realism about the issue under dispute. This is yet another way\ndisagreement can bear on the realism/antirealism debate. Can\nexperimental evidence involving disagreement tell us anything about\nthe semantics of moral language?\n\nOne reason to think it can is that the very idea of faultless\ndisagreement strikes some as incoherent. In cases where one individual\nthinks (or says) that pistachio ice cream is delicious and another\nthinks (or says) that it is disgusting, we understand the two parties\nas expressing their own personal preference. To explain the apparent\nfaultlessness of the dispute, we reinterpret their thoughts or\nutterances as expressing something like, \u201cpistachio ice cream is\ndelicious [disgusting] to me.\u201d Because the two parties\ndo not genuinely contradict one another, we need not say that one of\nthem is mistaken. Faultlessness is therefore supposed to be a point in\nfavor of the moral anti-realist, since it seems to imply that there is\nno single content about which the parties disagree (and about which\none might be mistaken).\n\nBy contrast, realists claim that their view is better able to capture\nour intuition that there is a genuine disagreement at stake when one\nperson says that stealing is wrong and another says that stealing is\nnot wrong. In these cases, realists argue, we have the intuition that\nthere really is a conflict, and only a theory on which moral language\ninvolves attributing properties to acts and things, rather than\nreporting or expressing speakers\u2019 attitudes, can capture this\nintuition.\n\nWe have already seen some data bearing on this issue in our discussion\nof folk realism above. The claim here is not about realism per se, but\nabout whether experimental evidence can give us insight into the\nsemantics of moral language, since our intuitions about whether there\nis genuine faultlessness can tell us about whether there is a single\nshared content between two utterances\u2014a single proposition that\none party asserts and another denies\u2014or whether the two\nparties\u2019 utterances contain implicit relativizations. This has,\nat least, been the assumption guiding much of the debate over\ndisagreement and its implication for moral semantics. In recent work,\nhowever, John Khoo and Joshua Knobe (2018) have cast doubt on this\nassumption; their experiments indicate that subjects do not see\ndisagreement as requiring exclusionary content\u2014a single\nproposition that one party accepts and the other rejects. Intuitions\nabout disagreement may thus not be as straightforwardly tied to moral\nsemantics as philosophers have thought: judgments that two individuals\ngenuinely disagree about some claim do not necessarily imply a single\nshared content between the two speakers. This work is still in early\nstages, but it reveals the complications involved in reading semantics\noff disagreement.\n\nA further challenge for attempts to experimentally investigate moral\nsemantics is the debate within antirealism between cognitivism and\nnoncognitivism. According to the cognitivist, ordinary moral sentences\nare best understood as factual assertions, expressing propositions\nthat attribute moral properties (such as rightness or goodness) to\nthings (such as actions or characters). Noncognitivists (including\ntheir contemporary representatives, the expressivists) hold that moral\nlanguage has a fundamentally different function, to express attitudes\nor to issue commands, for example. While this debate seems ripe for\nexperimental investigation, the noncognitivist typically acknowledges\nthat their view is a reforming one. Furthermore, the semantics of our\nterms may be opaque to ordinary users, to the extent that we cannot\nread off semantics from intuitions but must investigate them\nindirectly. Lastly, the cognitivist and noncognitivist can agree on a\nnumber of empirical features of moral judgment and discourse; the\nchallenge for experimentalists is to find predictions that confirm one\nview while disconfirming the other. This is a relatively new area of\ninvestigation and, while not without challenges, ripe for\nexploration.\n",
