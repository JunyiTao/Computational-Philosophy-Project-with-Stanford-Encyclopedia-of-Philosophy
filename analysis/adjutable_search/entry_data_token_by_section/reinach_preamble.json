    "main_text": "\n\n\nAdolf Reinach was a leading representative of the so-called realist\ntradition within phenomenology who has been described as\nHusserl's \u201cfirst real co-worker in the development of the\nphenomenological movement\u201d (Willard 1969, p. 194). Although his\nlife was tragically cut short, and his corpus of writings modest in\nsize, Reinach's essays on general ontology, on the philosophy of\nlaw and on the philosophy of language, are remarkably clear and\noriginal examples of the phenomenological approach to philosophizing.\nHis principal distinction lies in his 1913 monograph \u201cOn the\nA Priori Foundations of the Civil Law\u201d, whose analysis\nof the act of promising anticipates several crucial aspects of the\nspeech act theories of Austin and Searle.\n",
