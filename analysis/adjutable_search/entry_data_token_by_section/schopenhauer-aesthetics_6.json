    "main_text": "The Beautiful and the Sublime || The Stimulating\n4.2 The Stimulating\n\n\nThe first category of contemplation-resistant objects, Schopenhauer\nterms, \u201cthe stimulating\u201d or the \u201ccharming\u201d.\nThese may be positively or negatively stimulating. On the positive\nside, he gives as examples, \u201cprepared and table-ready dishes,\noysters, herring, lobster, bread and butter, beer, wine, etc.\u201d\n(WWR I, 232). Since he holds that these necessarily stir\nthe appetite, they inevitably resist aesthetic contemplation and are\ntherefore unsuitable to be presented in works of art such as still-life\npaintings.\n\n\nAlong the same lines, a calculatedly-arousing treatment of\nnudes\u2014what we might today put on a spectrum of pornography\u2014for\nSchopenhauer, prevents aesthetic contemplation because it inevitably\nexcites lust and thus runs counter to the proper goals of art.\n Schopenhauer may have room in his aesthetic theory for erotic\nart, but this is not a topic which he explicitly addresses.\n\n\nOn the negatively stimulating side fall objects which are\ndisgusting. For reasons parallel to those offered with respect to the\npositively stimulating, disgusting objects should also be banished from\nart, because they necessarily arouse intense negative willing or\n\u201crepugnance\u201d. Ugliness, however, is not identical to the\ndisgusting, need not lead to repugnance and has, for Schopenhauer, a\nlegitimate place in art. Curiously, it seems that for both the\npositively and negatively stimulating Schopenhauer does not believe\nthat we may intellectually detach ourselves from our attraction, lust\nor repugnance in order to contemplate these aesthetically. But\nthe grounds on which he holds this view remain somewhat obscure (for\nmore on this topic see Neill 2015).\n",
