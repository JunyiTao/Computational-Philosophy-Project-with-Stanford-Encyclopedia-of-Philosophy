    "preamble": "\n\nKant\u2019s views on aesthetics and teleology are most fully\npresented in his Critique of Judgment (Kritik der\nUrteilskraft, now often translated Critique of the Power of\nJudgment), published in\n 1790.[1]\n This work is in two parts, preceded by a long introduction in which\nKant explains and defends the work\u2019s importance to his critical\nsystem overall. In the first part, the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic\nJudgment\u201d, Kant discusses aesthetic experience and judgment, in\nparticular of the beautiful and the sublime, and also artistic\ncreation; in the second part, the \u201cCritique of Teleological\nJudgment\u201d, he discusses the role of teleology (that is, appeal\nto ends, purposes or goals) in natural science and in our\nunderstanding of nature more generally. The Critique of\nJudgment was the third and last of Kant\u2019s three\nCritiques, the other two being the Critique of Pure\nReason (1781, with a second edition in 1787), which deals with\nmetaphysics and epistemology, and the Critique of Practical\nReason of 1788, which, alongside his Groundwork of the\nMetaphysics of Morals of 1785, deals with ethics.\n\nAlthough interest in the Critique of Judgment has increased\nsubstantially over the last several decades, it has received less\nattention than the other two Critiques. One reason is that\nthe areas of aesthetics and natural teleology have traditionally been\nconsidered less philosophically central than those of ethics,\nmetaphysics and epistemology. Another is that it raises an\ninterpretive problem which has no analogue in the case of the other\nCritiques: that is, how to make sense of the work as a whole\ngiven the seeming disparity of the two parts, not only with each\nother, but also with the \u201cfaculty of judgment\u201d which is\nthe work\u2019s ostensible focus. However, Kant\u2019s aesthetic\ntheory has always been extremely influential within philosophical\naesthetics and the philosophy of art, and since the late 1970s there\nhas been a rapidly expanding literature on Kant\u2019s aesthetics\nwithin Anglo-American Kant interpretation. (Some of the growth in the\nliterature up to 2008 is documented in Guyer 2009.) Kant\u2019s views\non natural teleology, very much neglected in comparison to his\naesthetics, started to receive more attention in the early 1990s, and\nthere has been increased interest, during the last two decades in\nparticular, both in Kant\u2019s view of teleology in its own right,\nand in its potential relevance to contemporary philosophy of biology\nand to other areas in philosophy. Moreover, again since the 1990s,\nmore attention has been directed towards the project of interpreting\nthe Critique of Judgment as a coherent whole. With increased\nfocus on its general philosophical underpinnings, the third\nCritique has come to be seen not only as significant within\nthe disciplines of aesthetics and philosophy of biology, but also as\nplaying an important systematic role with respect to Kant\u2019s\nepistemology, metaphysics and ethics, and indeed, as relevant to\ncontemporary discussions in these, and related, areas.\n\nKant\u2019s aesthetics and teleology together comprise a very wide\nfield, and this article cannot cover all the relevant topics, nor take\naccount of all the relevant literature, especially given the recent\nexpansion of scholarly interest in the third Critique. I\nmention here three more specific limitations. First, although Kant\nwrote on aesthetics and teleology throughout his career, this article\nconsiders only Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment (along with\nthe so-called \u201cFirst Introduction\u201d, an earlier version of\nthe Introduction that was not published during Kant\u2019s lifetime\nbut that is included with the most recent English translations of the\nCritique of Judgment). Second, this article is concerned\nprimarily with the interpretive and philosophical issues raised by\nKant\u2019s writings on these topics, as opposed to historical\nquestions regarding their origin and reception. Third, the article\nfocusses primarily on those issues that have attracted most attention\nin the Anglo-American analytic tradition; this is reflected in the\nbibliography, which is largely restricted to works in English, and\nmore specifically works written from an analytic perspective. For some\nreferences to Kant\u2019s writings on aesthetics and teleology other\nthan the Critique of Judgment, see under Primary Sources in\nthe Bibliography. Some suggestions for secondary literature dealing\nwith the history and reception of Kant\u2019s aesthetics and\nteleology, and for secondary literature in English from a less\nanalytic perspective, are given under Secondary Sources in the\nBibliography.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Faculty of Judgment and the Unity of the Third Critique\n\nKant\u2019s account of aesthetics and teleology is ostensibly part of\na broader discussion of the faculty or power of judgment\n[Urteilskraft], which is the faculty \u201cfor thinking the\nparticular under the universal\u201d (Introduction IV, 5:179).\nAlthough the Critique of Pure Reason includes some discussion\nof the faculty of judgment, defined as \u201cthe capacity to subsume\nunder rules, that is, to distinguish whether something falls under a\ngiven rule\u201d (A132/B171), it is not until the Critique of\nJudgment that he treats judgment as a full-fledged faculty in its\nown right, with its own a priori principle, and, accordingly,\nrequiring a \u201ccritique\u201d to determine its scope and\nlimits.\n\nKant describes judgment in the Critique of Judgment as having\ntwo roles or aspects, \u201cdetermining\u201d [bestimmend]\nand \u201creflecting\u201d [reflektierend] (Introduction\nIV, 5:179 and FI V, 20:211). Judgment in its determining role subsumes\ngiven particulars under concepts or universals which are themselves\nalready given. This role coincides with the role assigned to the\nfaculty of judgment in the Critique of Pure Reason; it also\nappears to correspond to the activity of imagination in its\n\u201cschematism\u201d of concepts. Judgment in this role does not\noperate as an independent faculty, but is instead governed by\nprinciples of the understanding. The more distinctive role assigned to\njudgment in the Critique of Judgment is the reflecting role,\nthat of \u201cfinding\u201d the universal for the given particular\n(Introduction IV, 5:179). Kant\u2019s recognition of judgment as a\nfaculty in its own right, and hence of the need for a\nCritique not just for theoretical and practical reason but\nalso for judgment, appears to be connected with his ascription to\njudgment of a reflecting, in addition to a merely determining,\nrole.\n\nJudgment as reflecting, or reflective judgment [reflektierende\nUrteilskraft], is assigned various different roles within\nKant\u2019s system. Kant describes it as responsible for various\ncognitive tasks associated with empirical scientific enquiry, in\nparticular, the classification of natural things into a hierarchical\ntaxonomy of genera and species, and the construction of systematic\nexplanatory scientific theories. Kant also suggests that it has a more\nfundamental role to play in making cognition possible, in particular\nthat it enables us to regard nature as empirically lawlike (see\nespecially Introduction V, 5:184), and, even more fundamentally, that\nit is responsible for the formation of all empirical concepts (see\nespecially FI V, 20:211\u2013213).\n\nBut reflective judgment is also described as responsible for two\nspecific kinds of judgments: aesthetic judgments (judgments about the\nbeautiful and the sublime) and teleological judgments (judgments which\nascribe ends or purposes to natural things, or which characterize them\nin purposive or functional terms). These, along with associated\ntopics, are discussed respectively in Section I, the \u201cCritique\nof Aesthetic Judgment, \u201d and Section II, the \u201cCritique of\nTeleological Judgment. \u201d The discussion of the role of judgment\nin empirical scientific enquiry is confined to a few sections of the\nIntroduction and First Introduction.\n\nAlthough reflective judgment is exercised in both aesthetic and\nteleological judgment, Kant assigns a special role to its exercise in\nthe aesthetic case, and specifically in judgments of beauty\n(Introduction VIII, 193; FI XI, 243\u2013244). More specifically, he\nsays, it is in judgments of beauty (as opposed to the sublime), and\neven more specifically, judgments about the beauty of nature (as\nopposed to art), that \u201cjudgment reveals itself as a faculty that\nhas its own special principle\u201d (FI XI, 244). The especially\nclose connection between judgments of beauty and the faculty of\njudgment is reflected in Kant\u2019s view that the feeling of\npleasure in a beautiful object is felt in virtue of an exercise of\nreflective judgment (Introduction VII, FI VIII).\n\nMuch of Kant\u2019s aesthetics and theory of teleology is developed\nwithout any explicit reference to the faculty of judgment, and the\n\u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d makes no mention of\nreflective judgment as it figures in empirical scientific enquiry (in\nfact, the term \u201creflective judgment\u201d does not\nappear in the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d at\nall). The only suggestion in the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic\nJudgment\u201d of an important role for the faculty of judgment in\nKant\u2019s aesthetics is in the Deduction of Taste, where he\ndescribes the principle of taste as the \u201csubjective principle of\njudgment in general\u201d (\u00a735, 286) and suggests that the\nrelation of aesthetic judgment specifically to the faculty of judgment\nin general is crucial for the legitimacy of judgments of beauty\n(\u00a738, 290). Accordingly, much of the secondary literature on\nKant\u2019s aesthetics has treated it in isolation from the more\ngeneral account of judgment in which it is embedded, and the same is\ntrue, perhaps to an even greater extent, in the case of Kant\u2019s\nteleology. Conversely, discussions of Kant\u2019s \u201ctheory of\njudgment\u201d have typically taken little or no account of\nKant\u2019s treatment of judgment in the third Critique,\nsuggesting thereby that Kant\u2019s views on judgment are exhausted\nby his account of cognitive (in particular non-aesthetic) judgments in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason and the Logic. (The\narticle\n \u201cKant\u2019s Theory of Judgment\u201d\n in the present Encyclopedia [Hanna 2004 [2018]] is one example.)\n\nHowever, since the late 1980s philosophers working on Kant have become\nincreasingly interested in the notion of judgment in the third\nCritique. One way in which this interest has been pursued is\nthrough an exploration of the relation of Kant\u2019s notion of\njudgment in the third Critique to his account of cognition in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason and the Logic.\nLonguenesse (1993 [1998]) maintains that there is a close connection\nbetween the \u201ccapacity to judge\u201d [Verm\u00f6gen zu\nurteilen] in that work and the faculty of judgment in the\nCritique of Judgment, a connection which she summarizes by\ndescribing the faculty of judgment as the \u201cactualization\u201d\nof the capacity to judge in relation to sensory perceptions (1993\n[1998: 8]). According to Longuenesse, the activity of reflective\njudgment corresponds to the \u201ccomparison, reflection and\nabstraction\u201d which Kant describes in the Logic\n(\u00a76, 9:94\u201395) as responsible for the formation of empirical\nconcepts, and which she understands as, in turn, a necessary condition\nof the application of the pure concepts of understanding to the\nmanifold of sensible intuition (1993 [1998: 163\u2013166 and\n195\u2013197]). Longuenesse\u2019s view on this point is endorsed\nand elaborated in Allison 2001: ch. 1.\n\nAnother manifestation of interest in the notion of judgment has been\nthe exploration of connections between Kant\u2019s account of\naesthetic experience and judgment in the third Critique and\nhis theory of cognitive judgments in the first Critique. Bell\n(1987) and Ginsborg (1990a) both argue that, for Kant, the possibility\nof aesthetic experience to be, in some sense, a condition of the\npossibility of cognitive judgment; Makkreel (1990), from a more\nContinental, and specifically hermeneutical perspective, also argues\nfor deep connections between Kant\u2019s aesthetics and his account\nof cognition. Kukla (2006) collects together a number of essays\nexploring the relation between Kant\u2019s aesthetics and his theory\nof cognition; the introduction to Kukla 2006 offers some historical\nperspective on the increased interest in Kant\u2019s aesthetics as\nplaying a systematic role in Kant\u2019s epistemological program.\nHughes (2007: ch. 5) argues that Kant\u2019s views in the\nCritique of Judgment are necessary for a full understanding\nof Kant\u2019s account of synthesis in the first Critique and for the\nTranscendental Deduction of the categories in the first\nCritique. Ginsborg (2006) and Geiger (2020) both argue for a\nconnection between the possibility of aesthetic judgment and that of\nthe acquisition of empirical concepts. Breitenbach (2021) proposes\nthat aesthetic judgment and cognitive judgment share a \u201ccommon\ncore\u201d of imaginative reflection which helps account for\nscientific creativity. Makkai (2021: ch. 1), while sympathetic to the\nidea that Kant\u2019s aesthetics makes a contribution to his view of\ncognition, argues that several attempts to make out the connection,\nincluding those of Bell (1987) and Allison (2001), rest on a mistaken\nconstrual of Kant\u2019s notion of judgment. Rather than endorsing\nthe idea that aesthetic judgment is somehow presupposed by cognition,\nshe proposes that they are parallel, both having a basis in reflective\njudgment (Makkai 2021: ch. 4).\n\nAn important reason why commentators have been interested in\nKant\u2019s account of judgment in the Critique of Judgment\nis as a potential solution to the question of what unifies the various\nparts of the Critique of Judgment, and, in particular, what\nconnects the discussion of aesthetics in the first half of the book\nwith that of teleology in the second half of the book. Until the\n1980s, many commentators were skeptical that there was any real\nphilosophical connection between the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic\nJudgment\u201d (Part I) and the \u201cCritique of Teleological\nJudgment\u201d (Part II); for expressions of this view see for\nexample Schopenhauer (1819/1859 [1969: vol. I, 531]), Marc-Wogau\n(1938: 34n.), and Beck (1969: 497). But since then there has been much\nmore interest in understanding the work as a unified whole, where this\ninvolves recognizing connections, not only between the \u201cCritique\nof Aesthetic Judgment\u201d and the \u201cCritique of Teleological\nJudgment\u201d, but also between those two sections and the\nIntroduction (and First Introduction) to the Critique of\nJudgment as a whole. (The decision by the editors of the present\nEncyclopedia to treat the seemingly disparate topics of Kant\u2019s\naesthetics and Kant\u2019s teleology in a single article represents\none illustration of this general orientation towards the unity of the\nwork.)\n\nOne way in which commentators have tried to find unity in the\nCritique of Judgment is by connecting Kant\u2019s aesthetics\nwith his discussions, in the Introduction and First Introduction, of\nthe search for a system of empirical concepts and laws. Examples of\nthis approach include Ginsborg (1990a), Hughes (2007), Zuckert\n(2007a), and Geiger (2020). Another, potentially complementary, way is\nto find connections between his theory of beauty and his views on\nbiology in the Critique of Teleological Judgment. Zumbach (1984:\n51\u201353) suggests that works of art are analogous to organisms;\nMakkreel (1990: ch. 5) sees the connection as turning on the idea of\npleasure as the feeling of mental life. Aquila (1992) draws a\nconnection between the internal structure of organisms as one in which\nthe whole determines the parts, and the internal structure of a\njudgment of beauty as one in which a feeling of pleasure rather than a\nconcept serves as a predicate. Ginsborg (1997a) connects Kant\u2019s\naesthetics and his biological views in terms of the idea of\npurposiveness construed as normativity: the normativity in the\nfunctioning of organisms parallels the normative claim to universal\nagreement made by a judgment of beauty. Zuckert (2007a) offers an\nespecially detailed account of the connection, also emphasizing the\nnotion of purposiveness, but construing it as unity in diversity,\nwhich is manifested in beautiful objects and organisms alike. Geiger\n(2020) suggests that organisms play a special role as objects of\naesthetic judgment, and suggests that our aesthetic judgments about\norganisms are closely allied to our sorting of nature into kinds and\nhence our acquisition of empirical concepts.\n\nA contrasting approach to the unity of the Critique of\nJudgment goes by way of Kant\u2019s moral teleology, and invokes\nKant\u2019s claim that the Critique of Judgment is intended\nto bridge the gulf between nature and freedom (Introduction II and\nIII, 175\u2013177). This approach is implicit in many discussions of\nthe relevance of Kant\u2019s aesthetics to his account of morality\n(see\n Section 2.8),\n which in turn can be connected to his theory of teleology through the\nidea that the human being, as a free and rational agent, is the\n\u201cultimate purpose\u201d [Endzweck] of nature (see\n Section 3.6).\n Gardner (2016) offers an explicit defence of this kind of approach,\ndrawing on the idea that aesthetic experience reveals the suitability\nof nature for human moral agency; this idea is also emphasized in\nWicks (2007). Savile (2021) invokes a related idea and ascribes it to\nKant under the label of \u201caesthetic humanism\u201d. Vaccarino\nBremner (forthcoming) develops this kind of approach in detail by\nfocussing on Kant\u2019s idea of culture, which Kant identifies as\nthe ultimate purpose [letzter Zweck] of nature (5:429), and\nwhich, on her view, mediates between nature itself and the final\npurpose [Endzweck] of nature, that is the human being as a\nmoral agent.\n\nThe theme of the unity of the Critique of Judgment is closely\nrelated to that of the role of the Critique of Judgment in\nKant\u2019s overall philosophical system. Pollok (2017: ch. 9) offers\nsome brief but suggestive remarks on that topic; Huseyinzadegan (2018)\naddresses both the internal unity of the Critique of Judgment\nand its relation to Kant\u2019s Opus Postumum.\n2. Aesthetics\n\nAn aesthetic judgment, in Kant\u2019s usage, is a judgment which is\nbased on feeling, and in particular on the feeling of pleasure or\ndispleasure. According to Kant\u2019s official view there are three\nkinds of aesthetic judgment: judgments of the agreeable, judgments of\nbeauty (or, equivalently, judgments of taste), and judgments of the\nsublime. However, Kant often uses the expression \u201caesthetic\njudgment\u201d in a narrower sense which excludes judgments of the\nagreeable, and it is with aesthetic judgments in this narrower sense\nthat the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d is primarily\nconcerned. Such judgments can either be, or fail to be,\n\u201cpure\u201d; while Kant mostly focusses on the ones which are\npure, there are reasons to think that most judgments about art (as\nopposed to nature) do not count as pure, so that it is important to\nunderstand Kant\u2019s views on such judgments as well.\n\nThe \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d is concerned not only\nwith judgments of the beautiful and the sublime, but also with the\nproduction of objects about which such judgments are appropriately\nmade; this topic is discussed under the headings of \u201cfine\nart\u201d or \u201cbeautiful art\u201d [sch\u00f6ne Kunst]\nand \u201cgenius\u201d.\n\nThe most distinctive part of Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory, and the\npart which has aroused most interest among commentators, is his\naccount of judgments of beauty, and, more specifically, pure judgments\nof beauty. (Following Kant\u2019s own usage, the expression\n\u201cjudgment of beauty\u201d without qualification will refer, in\nwhat follows, to pure judgments of beauty.) The most important\nelements of this account are sketched here in\n Section 2.1\n and\n Section 2.2,\n and which correspond roughly to the \u201cAnalytic of the\nBeautiful\u201d and the \u201cDeduction of Pure Aesthetic\nJudgments\u201d respectively.\n Section 2.3\n and\n Section 2.4\n are concerned, respectively, with interpretative issues that have\narisen in connection with the account, and with criticisms which have\nbeen made of it.\n\nOther elements of Kant\u2019s theory are sketched in the remainder of\nthe section. Section 2.5 is concerned with judgments of beauty that\nare not pure, in particular judgments of \u201cadherent\u201d as\nopposed to \u201cfree\u201d beauty;\n Section 2.6\n with beautiful art and genius;\n Section 2.7\n with judgments of the sublime;\n Section 2.8\n with the relation between aesthetics and morality; and\n Section 2.9\n with other implications of Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory.\n2.1 What is a Judgment of Beauty?\n\nThe first section of the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d,\nthe \u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful\u201d, aims to analyse the\nnotion of a judgment of beauty or judgment of taste, describing the\nfeatures which distinguish judgments of beauty from judgments of other\nkinds, notably cognitive judgments (which include judgments ascribing\ngoodness to things), and what he calls \u201cjudgments of the\nagreeable\u201d. Kant is not explicit about the pretheoretical\nconception of judgments of beauty which is the subject of his\nanalysis, and there is room for controversy about what does and does\nnot count as a judgment of beauty in Kant\u2019s sense. Not every\npredicative use of the word \u201cbeautiful\u201d signals the making\nof a judgment of beauty, at least in the paradigmatic sense with which\nKant is concerned (for a useful discussion, see Savile 1993: ch. 1).\nFor example, at \u00a78 Kant denies that the judgment that roses in\ngeneral are beautiful is a judgment of beauty or judgment of taste\nproper: it is not an \u201caesthetic\u201d but an\n\u201caesthetically grounded logical judgment\u201d. There is also\nroom for debate about whether the intuitive notion of a judgment of\nbeauty, for Kant, allows for negative judgments of beauty (see\n Section 2.3.6\n below). However, at a first approximation, we can say that it is the\nmental activity or content typically expressed by, or manifested in, a\nsincere utterance of \u201cthat\u2019s beautiful\u201d in reference\nto a perceptually presented object.\n\nKant analyses the notion of a judgment of beauty by considering it\nunder four headings, or \u201cmoments\u201d, as sketched below:\n2.1.1 First Moment (\u00a7\u00a71\u20135)\n\nJudgments of beauty are based on feeling, in particular feelings of\npleasure (Kant also mentions displeasure, but this does not figure\nprominently in his account; for more on this point, see\n Section 2.3.6\n below). The pleasure, however, is of a distinctive kind: it is\ndisinterested, which means that it does not depend on the\nsubject\u2019s having a desire for the object, nor does it generate\nsuch a desire. The fact that judgments of beauty are based on feeling\nrather than \u201cobjective sensation\u201d (e.g., the sensation of\na thing\u2019s colour) distinguishes them from cognitive judgments\nbased on perception (e.g., the judgment that a thing is green). But\nthe disinterested character of the feeling distinguishes them from\nother judgments based on feeling. In particular, it distinguishes them\nfrom (i) judgments of the agreeable, which are the kind of judgment\nexpressed by saying simply that one likes something or finds it\npleasing (for example, food or drink), and (ii) judgments of the good,\nincluding judgments both about the moral goodness of something and\nabout its goodness for particular non-moral purposes.\n2.1.2 Second Moment (\u00a7\u00a76\u20139)\n\nJudgments of beauty have, or make a claim to,\n\u201cuniversality\u201d or \u201cuniversal validity\u201d. (Kant\nalso uses the expression \u201cuniversal communicability\u201d; this\nhas been taken by many commentators as equivalent to \u201cuniversal\nvalidity\u201d but recently this has been questioned; see\n Section 2.3.8.)\n That is, in making a judgment of beauty about an object, one takes it\nthat everyone else who perceives the object ought also to judge it to\nbe beautiful, and, relatedly, to share one\u2019s pleasure in it. But\nthe universality is not \u201cbased on concepts\u201d. That is,\none\u2019s claim to agreement does not rest on the subsumption of the\nobject under a concept (in the way, for example, that the claim to\nagreement made by the judgment that something is green rests on the\nascription to the object of the property of being green, and hence its\nsubsumption under the concept green). It follows from this\nthat judgments of beauty cannot, despite their universal validity, be\nproved: there are no rules by which someone can be compelled to judge\nthat something is beautiful (Kant expands on this point in\n\u00a7\u00a732\u201333). More strongly, judgments of beauty are not\nto be understood as predicating the concept beauty of their\nobjects: as he puts it later, \u201cbeauty is not a concept of the\nobject\u201d (\u00a738, 290). Still later, in the \u201cAntinomy of\nTaste\u201d, Kant seems to go back on this strong claim by saying\nthat a judgment of beauty rests on an \u201cindeterminate\nconcept\u201d (\u00a757, 341); however, by \u201cconcept\u201d here\nhe diverges from the standard use of the term \u201cconcept\u201d as\nreferring to a kind of representation which can figure in\ncognition.\n\nThe fact that judgments of beauty are universally valid constitutes a\nfurther feature (in addition to the disinterestedness of the pleasure\non which they are based) distinguishing them from judgments of\nagreeable. For in claiming simply that one likes something, one does\nnot claim that everyone else ought to like it too. But the fact that\ntheir universal validity is not based on concepts distinguishes\njudgments of beauty from non-evaluative cognitive judgments and\njudgments of the good, both of which make a claim to universal\nvalidity that is based on concepts.\n2.1.3 Third Moment (\u00a7\u00a710\u201317)\n\nUnlike judgments of the good, judgments of the beautiful do not\npresuppose an end or purpose [Zweck] which the object is\ntaken to\n satisfy.[2]\n (This is closely related to the point that their universality is not\nbased on concepts). However, they nonetheless involve the\nrepresentation of what Kant calls \u201cpurposiveness\u201d\n[Zweckm\u00e4ssigkeit]. Because this representation of\npurposiveness does not involve the ascription of an purpose (in an\nexpression widely used by commentators, it is \u201cpurposiveness\nwithout a purpose\u201d), Kant calls the purposiveness which is\nrepresented \u201cmerely formal purposiveness\u201d or \u201cthe\nform of purposiveness\u201d. He describes it as perceived both in the\nobject itself and in the activity of imagination and understanding in\ntheir engagement with the object. (For more on this activity, see the\ndiscussion of the \u201cfree play of the faculties\u201d in\n Section 2.2;\n for more on the notion of purposiveness, see\n Section 3.1.)\n The Third Moment, in particular \u00a714, is the main evidence for\nKant\u2019s supposed formalism in aesthetics; for more on\nKant\u2019s formalism, see\n Section 2.4.\n2.1.4 Fourth Moment (\u00a718\u201322)\n\nJudgments of beauty involve reference to the idea of necessity, in the\nfollowing sense: in taking my judgment of taste to be universally\nvalid, I take it, not that everyone who perceives the object\nwill share my pleasure in it and (relatedly) agree with my\njudgment, but that everyone ought to do so. I take it, then,\nthat my pleasure stands in a \u201cnecessary\u201d relation to the\nobject which elicits it, where the necessity here can be described\n(though Kant himself does not use the term) as normative. But, as in\nthe case of universal validity, the necessity is not based on concepts\nor rules (at least, not concepts or rules that are determinate, that\nis, of a kind which figure in cognition; as noted earlier in this\nsection, Kant describes it, in the Antinomy of Taste, as resting on an\n\u201cindeterminate concept\u201d). Kant characterizes the necessity\nmore positively by saying that it is \u201cexemplary\u201d, in the\nsense that one\u2019s judgment itself serves as an example of how\neveryone ought to judge (\u00a718, 237). He also says that it is based\non a \u201ccommon sense\u201d (sensus communis), defined as\na subjective principle which allows us to judge by feeling rather than\nconcepts (\u00a720).\n2.2 How are Judgments of Beauty Possible?\n\nRunning through Kant\u2019s various characterizations of judgments of\nbeauty is a basic dichotomy between two apparently opposed sets of\nfeatures. On the one hand, judgments of beauty are based on feeling,\nthey do not depend on subsuming the object under a concept (in\nparticular, the concept of a purpose that such an object is supposed\nto satisfy), and they cannot be proved. This combination of features\nseems to suggest that judgments of beauty should be assimilated to\njudgments of the agreeable. On the other hand, however, judgments of\nbeauty are unlike judgments of the agreeable in not involving desire\nfor the object; more importantly and centrally, they make a normative\nclaim to everyone\u2019s agreement. These features seem to suggest\nthat they should be assimilated, instead, to objective cognitive\njudgments.\n\nIn claiming that judgments of beauty have both sets of features, Kant\ncan be seen as reacting equally against the two main opposing\ntraditions in eighteenth-century aesthetics: the\n\u201cempiricist\u201d tradition of aesthetics represented by Hume,\nHutcheson and Burke, on which a judgment of taste is an expression of\nfeeling without cognitive content, and the \u201crationalist\u201d\ntradition of aesthetics represented by Baumgarten and Meier, on which\na judgment of taste consists in the cognition of an object as having\nan objective property. Kant\u2019s insistence that there is an\nalternative to these two views, one on which judgments of beauty are\nboth based on feeling and make a claim to universal validity, is\nprobably the most distinctive aspect of his aesthetic theory. But this\ninsistence confronts him with the obvious problem of how the two\nfeatures, or sets of features, are to be reconciled. As Kant puts\nit:\n\n\nhow is a judgment possible which, merely from one\u2019s own\nfeeling of pleasure in an object, independent of its concept, judges\nthis pleasure as attached to the representation of the same object\nin every other subject, and does so a priori, i.e.,\nwithout having to wait for the assent of others?(\u00a736, 288)\n\n\nThe argument constituting Kant\u2019s official answer to this\nquestion (the \u201cDeduction of Taste\u201d) is presented in the\nsection entitled \u201cDeduction of Pure Aesthetic Judgments\u201d,\nin particular in sections \u00a7\u00a731\u201339, with the core of\nthe argument given at \u00a738. It is also prefigured in the\n\u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful\u201d, in particular at \u00a79 and\n\u00a722, although the argument of \u00a722, which appeals to the\nnotion of a \u201ccommon sense\u201d, takes a somewhat different\nform from the presentation in the \u201cDeduction of Taste\u201d\nproper.\n\nThe argument in all of its appearances relies on the claim, introduced\nin \u00a79, that pleasure in the beautiful depends on the \u201cfree\nplay\u201d or \u201cfree harmony\u201d of the faculties of\nimagination and understanding. In the Critique of Pure\nReason, imagination is described as \u201csynthesizing the\nmanifold of intuition\u201d under the governance of rules that are\nprescribed by the understanding: the outcome of this is cognitive\nperceptual experience of objects as having specific empirical\nfeatures. The rules prescribed by the understanding, are, or\ncorrespond to, particular concepts that are applied to the object. For\nexample, when a manifold is synthesized in accordance with the\nconcepts green and square, the outcome is a\nperceptual experience in which the object is perceived as green and\nsquare. But now in the Critique of Judgment, Kant suggests\nthat imagination and understanding can stand in a different kind of\nrelationship, one in which imagination\u2019s activity harmonizes\nwith the understanding but without imagination\u2019s being\nconstrained or governed by understanding. In this relationship,\nimagination and understanding in effect do what is ordinarily involved\nin the bringing of objects under concepts, and hence in the perception\nof objects as having empirical features: but they do this without\nbringing the object under any concept in particular. So, rather than\nperceiving the object as green or square, the subject whose faculties\nare in free play responds to it perceptually with a state of mind\nwhich is non-conceptual, and specifically a feeling of disinterested\npleasure. It is this kind of pleasure which is the basis for a\njudgment of taste.\n\nKant appeals to this account of pleasure in the beautiful in order to\nargue for its universal validity or universal communicability: to\nargue, that is, that a subject who feels such a pleasure, and thus\njudges the object to be beautiful, is entitled to demand that everyone\nelse feel a corresponding pleasure and thus agree with her judgment of\ntaste. For, he claims, the free play of the faculties manifests the\nsubjective condition of cognition in general (see for example \u00a79,\n218; \u00a721, 238; \u00a738, 290). We are entitled to claim that\neveryone ought to agree with our cognitions: for example, if I\nperceptually cognize an object as being green and square, I am\nentitled to claim that everyone else ought to cognize it as green and\nsquare. But in order for this demand for agreement to be possible, he\nsuggests, it must also be possible for me to demand universal\nagreement for the subjective condition of such cognitions. If I can\ntake it that everyone ought to share my cognition of an object as\ngreen or square, then I must also be entitled to take it that everyone\nought to share a perception of the object in which my faculties are in\nfree play, since the free play is no more than a manifestation of what\nis in general required for an object\u2019s being cognized as green\nor square in the first place.\n\nThe most serious objection to the argument can be put in the form of a\ndilemma; see for example Guyer (1979 [1997: 264]), Meerbote (1982:\n81ff.), Allison (2001: 184\u2013192), Rind (2002). Either the free\nplay of the faculties is involved in all cognitive perceptual\nexperience, or it is not. If it is, then it would seem,\ncounterintuitively, that every object should be perceived as\nbeautiful. (Because of this consequence of grasping the first horn,\nthe dilemma is sometimes characterized instead as Kant\u2019s\n\u201ceverything is beautiful\u201d problem.) But if it is not, then\nthe central inference does not seem to go through. From the fact that\nI can demand agreement for the state of my faculties in experiencing\nan object as, say, green or square, it does not follow that I can\ndemand agreement for a state in which my faculties are in free play,\nsince the possibility of experiencing the free play would seem to\nrequire something over and above what is required for cognition\nalone.\n\nMost defenders of the argument have grasped the second horn of the\ndilemma. One such defence, originally proposed by Ameriks in his 1982\n(subsequently incorporated into Ameriks 2003), relies on an\nunderstanding of judgments of taste as objective, and hence as making\na claim to universal agreement which is akin to that made by cognitive\njudgments. (For more on the objectivity of taste, see\n Section 2.3.5).\n Another, offered by Allison, rejects the objection as presupposing an\noverly strong interpretation of what the Deduction is intended to\naccomplish. The objection tells against the Deduction only if it is\nconstrued as entitling us to claim universal agreement for particular\njudgments of taste; but, as Allison reads it, the Deduction is\nintended only to establish that such claims can, in general, be\nlegitimate (Allison 2001: ch. 8; see especially 177\u2013179). A\nsimilar position is taken by Kalar (2006: 134). However, some\ncommentators have taken this kind of defence to be inadequate, holding\nthat the argument must establish not only a general entitlement to\ndemand agreement for judgments of beauty, but an entitlement in each\nparticular case (Savile 1987, Chignell 2007).\n\nAnother, less commonly accepted, option for defending the argument\nwould be to grasp the first horn, accepting that, on Kant\u2019s\naccount, every object can legitimately be judged to be beautiful.\nGracyk (1986) argues, independently of the argument of the Deduction,\nthat this is Kant\u2019s view, and it might also be noted that, if\njudgments of beauty are not objective, there can be no feature of an\nobject which rules it out as a candidate for being legitimately found\nbeautiful. Commentators who emphasize this point include Ginsborg\n(2017) and Breitenbach (2021).\n\nA number of commentators have taken the dilemma, or considerations\nrelated to it, to be fatal to Kant\u2019s view that judgments of\nbeauty make a legitimate claim to universal validity: see for example\nMeerbote 1982, cited above, and Guyer (1979: 284\u2013288; although\nGuyer offers a more positive assessment, see his 2003b: 60n15). Others\nhave argued that Kant\u2019s view can be saved by drawing on\nconsiderations not mentioned in the official argument of the\nDeduction. As noted below\n (Section 2.8),\n Kant draws a close connection between our capacity for aesthetic\njudgment and our nature as moral beings, and even though Kant himself\ndoes not appeal to this connection in the deduction of taste, some\ncommentators, including Elliott (1968), Crawford (1974), Kemal (1986)\nand Savile (1987), have taken moral considerations to constitute the\nultimate ground of the legitimacy of judgments of beauty. Another\nstrategy drawing on considerations outside the Deduction itself has\nbeen to appeal to Kant\u2019s theory of aesthetic ideas (see\n Section 2.6),\n which is ostensibly part of his theory of art, rather than his core\ntheory of taste. This strategy is adopted in Savile 1987 and Chignell\n2007; Chignell\u2019s view differs from Savile\u2019s in that it\ndoes not make any appeal to moral considerations. Finally, some\ncommentators have held that while the argument of the official\nDeduction at \u00a738 is unsuccessful in avoiding the dilemma, the\nversion of the argument offered at \u00a721, which appeals to the\nnotion of a \u201ccommon sense\u201d, is more effective; see in\nparticular Rind (2002) and Kalar (2006: ch. 5).\n\nThe assessment of the objection, and of Kant\u2019s Deduction of\nTaste more generally, is complicated by a number of more fundamental\ninterpretive issues, which are discussed in the next section.\n2.3 Judgments of Beauty: Interpretive Issues\n\nThis section describes eight issues which have arisen in connection\nwith Kant\u2019s account of pure judgments of taste, and which are\nrelevant to the assessment of his argument for the possibility of such\njudgments. Although these issues are central to understanding the core\nof Kant\u2019s view, readers seeking a more general survey of\nKant\u2019s aesthetics can omit this section.\n2.3.1 Pleasure and judgment\n\nWhat is the relation between the pleasure which is felt in an object\nexperienced as beautiful, and the judgment that the object is\nbeautiful, that is, the judgment of taste? Kant describes the judgment\nof taste as \u201cbased on\u201d a feeling of pleasure, and as\nclaiming that everyone ought to share the subject\u2019s feeling of\npleasure, or, as he puts it, as claiming the \u201cuniversal\ncommunicability\u201d of the pleasure. This seems to imply that the\npleasure is distinct from the act of judging, and more specifically\nthat the pleasure precedes the judging: we first feel pleasure, and\nthen claim, perhaps based on characteristics of the pleasure (such as\nits disinterestedness), that the pleasure is universally communicable\nand hence that the object is beautiful. But in the crucial section\n\u00a79 of the Critique of Judgment, Kant appears to reject\nthat implication: rather than the pleasure preceding the judging, he\nsays, the \u201cmerely subjective (aesthetic) judging of the\nobject\u201d both \u201cprecedes\u201d and \u201cis the ground\nof\u201d the pleasure (218). Since \u00a79 is specifically addressed\nto the issue \u201cwhether in a judgment of taste the feeling of\npleasure precedes the judging of the object or the judging precedes\nthe pleasure\u201d, a problem whose answer is \u201cthe key to the\ncritique of taste and hence deserves full attention\u201d (216),\ncommentators have taken very seriously the task of reconciling \u00a79\nwith Kant\u2019s other characterizations of the judgment of\ntaste.\n\nThere has been much discussion, beginning in the 1970s, of this basic\nissue. Donald Crawford addressed the apparent paradox by\ndistinguishing the \u201cjudging\u201d of the object which,\naccording to \u00a79, precedes the pleasure in it, from the judgment\nof taste proper, which is based on the pleasure (1974: 69\u201374). A\nvery influential approach along these lines was developed in detail by\nGuyer (1979), who draws on passages elsewhere in the text to defend\nthe view that a judgment of taste results from two distinct acts of\nreflective judgment, the first identifiable with the free play of the\nfaculties and resulting in a feeling of pleasure, the second an act of\nreflection on the pleasure which results in the claim that the\npleasure is universally communicable. (See especially 97\u2013105 and\n133\u2013141.) A difficulty with that approach, however, recognized\nby Guyer, is that it conflicts with another passage at \u00a79, in\nwhich Kant describes the pleasure as consequent on the universal\ncommunicability of the subject\u2019s mental state in the given\nrepresentation (\u00a79, 5:217). This implies that the act of judging\nwhich precedes the pleasure must be one in which the subject takes her\nstate of mind to be universally communicable, requiring us to identify\nit with the judgment of taste proper rather than with an activity of\nthe faculties prior to that judgment.\n\nAn alternative approach to \u00a79, which attempts to accommodate the\nproblematic passage without emendation, was offered in Ginsborg 1991.\nOn this \u201cone-act\u201d approach the act of judging something to\nbe beautiful is a single, self-referential act of judging which claims\nits own universal validity with respect to the object and which is\nphenomenologically manifested as a feeling of pleasure. The free play\nof the faculties on this approach is identical with the judging of the\nobject to be beautiful and in turn with the feeling of pleasure: the\npleasure does not precede the judging of the object to be beautiful,\nand is \u201cconsequent\u201d on it only in the sense that we feel\npleasure \u201cin virtue\u201d of the judgment. In its\nidentification of the pleasure and the judgment the view is like that\nof Aquila (1982, see especially 107) and, more recently, Wicks (2007:\n43\u201345), although neither Aquila nor Wicks explicitly endorses\nthe apparent consequence, that the pleasure or judgment must involve a\nclaim to its own universal communicability.\n\nSince then several commentators have read the relevant paragraphs of\n\u00a79 as requiring some kind of \u201ctwo-acts\u201d view and, at\nthe very least, as distinguishing the free play of the faculties and\npleasure in the beautiful from the judgment of taste proper. This\nrequires addressing the textual difficulty just mentioned. Guyer\nhimself proposes disregarding the problematic passage at 5:217, since\nhe takes it to indicate the intrusion of an earlier, incompatible\ntheory (1979 [1997: 139\u2013140]; for a detailed discussion, see\nGuyer 1982); Allison suggests instead that the passage be amended so\nthat the pleasure is understood as consequent on a \u201cuniversally\ncommunicable\u201d mental state, rather than on the state\u2019s\nuniversal communicability (2001: 115).\n\nObjections to the one-act approach have been raised by a number of\ncommentators, in particular Allison, who partly endorses\nGinsborg\u2019s criticisms of Guyer, but raises difficulties for her\nreading of \u00a79 (2001: 113\u2013115) and, in particular, rejects\nthe self-referential understanding of judgments of beauty as\n\u201cinherently implausible\u201d (2001: 115). Allison objects also\nthat the one-act view fails to accommodate judgments of the ugly; for\nmore on Kant\u2019s views on the ugly, see\n Section 2.3.6.\n Criticisms of Ginsborg\u2019s one-act approach are also to be found\nin Pippin (1996), Ameriks (1998), Palmer (2008), Vandenabeele (2008),\nSweet (2009), Guyer (2017a), Makkai (2010 and 2021), and Berger\n(forthcoming); Ginsborg replies to Guyer\u2019s criticism in her\n2017.\n\nCommentators have suggested a number of models for the feeling of\npleasure and its relation to the judgment of beauty that combine\nfeatures of both the one-act and the two-act view. B\u00e9atrice\nLonguenesse offers a view which is in partial agreement with\nGinsborg\u2019s in that it understands pleasure in the beautiful\nproper as felt in virtue of the subject\u2019s awareness of the\nuniversal communicability of her mental state in the presented object\n(thus, like the one-act approach, requiring no emendation of \u00a79).\nHowever, rather than understand the pleasure as awareness of its own\nuniversal communicability, Longuenesse takes it to be awareness of a\nprior, and independent, feeling of pleasure elicited by the free play\nof the faculties, so that there are two distinct feelings of pleasure\ninvolved in judging an object to be beautiful (2003: 152\u2013155;\n2006: 203\u2013208). Sethi (2019 and forthcoming) likewise proposes\nthat there are two distinct feelings, but denies that they are both\nfeelings of pleasure: as on Ginsborg\u2019s view, the pleasure is\nfelt in virtue of the subject\u2019s claim to the universal\ncommunicability of her feeling, but the feeling for which she claims\nuniversal communicability is not a feeling of pleasure but an\nantecedent, sui generis, feeling of the harmony of the\nfaculties. Hughes (2017) argues for a single feeling associated with\nthe judgment of beauty, but one which has a dual intentional\ndirectedness: towards the object and to the activity of the faculties\nin judging the object. Some commentators have endorsed a one-act\napproach while, unlike Ginsborg, rejecting the identification of the\npleasure and the judgment: these include, for example Zuckert (2007a:\n\u00a7\u00a71\u20132 of ch. 8) and Pollok (2017: ch. 9). Berger\n(forthcoming) defends a two-acts view, but her view differs from\nGuyer\u2019s in that the second act is not one of reflection on the\npleasure but rather of subsumption of the pleasure under the concept\nof beauty.\n2.3.2 The free play of imagination and understanding\n\nKant\u2019s notion of the free play of the faculties (sometimes\nreferred to as the \u201charmony of the faculties\u201d, or, more\naccurately the \u201cfree harmony\u201d of the faculties) is\nprobably the most central notion of his aesthetic theory. But what is\nit for the faculties of imagination and understanding to be in\n\u201cfree play\u201d? Kant describes the imagination and\nunderstanding in this \u201cfree play\u201d as freely harmonizing,\nwithout the imagination\u2019s being constrained by the understanding\nas it is in cognition. Imagination in the free play, he says, conforms\nto the general conditions for the application of concepts to objects\nthat are presented to our senses, yet without any particular concept\nbeing applied, so that imagination conforms to the conditions of\nunderstanding without the constraint of particular concepts. Given\nKant\u2019s view that concepts are, or at least correspond to, rules\nby which imagination \u201csynthesizes\u201d or organizes the data\nof sense-perception, this amounts to saying that imagination functions\nin a rule-governed way but without being governed by any rule in\nparticular. The free play thus manifests, in Kant\u2019s terms,\n\u201cfree lawfulness\u201d or \u201clawfulness without a\nlaw\u201d. But there is an apparent paradox in these\ncharacterizations which is left unaddressed by Kant\u2019s own,\nlargely metaphorical, explanations. It is left to commentators to try\nto explain how such an activity is intelligible and why, if it is\nindeed intelligible, it should give rise to, or be experienced as, a\nfeeling of pleasure.\n\nSome commentators try to make sense of the free play by appealing to\nthe phenomenology of aesthetic experience, for example to the kind of\nexperience involved in appreciating an abstract painting, where the\nsubject might imaginatively relate the various elements of the\npainting to one another and perceive them as having an order and unity\nwhich is non-conceptual; see for example Bell (1987: 237) and Crowther\n(1989: 56). (Filieri 2021 illustrates the free play through the\nexample of an artwork which is representational rather than abstract.)\nOthers try to find a place for it in the context of Kant\u2019s\ntheory of the imagination as presented in the Critique of Pure\nReason. Two contrasting accounts along these lines are offered by\nGuyer, who identifies the free play with the first two stages of the\n\u201cthree-fold synthesis\u201d described by Kant in the first\nedition Transcendental Deduction (Guyer 1979 [1997: 75\u201376]), and\nof Makkreel (1990: 49\u201358), for whom the free play is an activity\nof schematizing pure concepts without the involvement of empirical\nconcepts.\n\nGinsborg (1997a) offers an alternative view of the free play derived\nfrom her \u201cone-act\u201d reading of the judgment of taste (see\n Section 2.3.1),\n on which what it is for the imagination and understanding to be in\nfree play just is for the subject to be in a perceptual state of mind\nwhich involves a nonconceptual claim to its own universal validity\nwith respect to the object perceived. Zinkin (2006) explains the free\nplay in terms of the common sense (sensus communis) invoked\nby Kant at \u00a720, which she understands as an intensive form of\nsensibility, in contrast to the extensive forms of sensibility\nrepresented by space and time. (For more on the common sense, see\n Section 2.3.7.)\n Gorodeisky (2011) criticizes \u201cextra-aesthetic\u201d approaches\nto the free play which attempt to relate the activity of the faculties\nin the free play too closely to their activity in cognition, failing\nto do justice to their distinctly aesthetic character; Ostaric 2017\nmakes a related complaint. Williams 2022 proposes that the free play\nis to be understood in terms of how attention is guided: in cognition,\nour attention is guided by cognitive interest, in aesthetics the\nsubject is guided only by the interests of the imagination, so that\nthe subject has the freedom to let her attention roam.\n\nAs with the deduction of taste (see\n Section 2.2),\n a number of commentators have looked to Kant\u2019s doctrine of\naesthetic ideas (officially part of his account of fine art) to make\nsense of the free play of the faculties; examples include Rueger and\nEvren (2005), Kalar (2006), and Chignell (2007). A particularly\ndetailed and thorough treatment of this approach is offered in\nRogerson (2008; for an earlier and briefer treatment, see Rogerson\n2004).\n\nThe question of how to understand the free play is complicated by a\nmore general interpretive issue concerning the status of Kant\u2019s\n\u201ctranscendental psychology\u201d: this issue affects not only\nthe interpretation of the free play in the third Critique,\nbut also the appeal to activities of imagination and understanding in\nKant\u2019s account of the conditions of cognition in the first\nCritique, in particular in the Metaphysical Deduction and the\nTranscendental Deduction. Many commentators assume, whether tacitly or\nexplicitly, that the free play of imagination and understanding\nrepresents a natural psychological process, taking place in time and\nthus subject to natural causal laws. But it is hard to reconcile this\nunderstanding of the free play with Kant\u2019s appeal to it to\njustify the legitimacy of judgments of beauty, and more generally his\nclaim to be offering a transcendental account of judgments of beauty,\none which shows such judgments to be founded on an a priori\nprinciple. Guyer\u2019s approach to the free play, from his 1979\nonwards, has been thoroughly naturalistic; in his 2008 he offers a\nvery explicit defence of this approach, arguing that we should reject\nKant\u2019s claim to establish an a priori or transcendental\nprinciple justifying judgments of beauty, and instead regard\nKant\u2019s theory of aesthetics as a contribution to the empirical\npsychology of taste. While this kind of view is rarely explicitly\nendorsed, many commentators do in fact offer accounts of the free play\nwhich at least resemble empirical psychological accounts, raising the\nquestion of how Guyer\u2019s conclusion is to be avoided.\n\nThe views touched on in this section represent only a sampling of the\nvarious accounts of the free play which have been offered. A useful\nsurvey is offered by Guyer (2006), who classifies various accounts\nunder three heads: \u201cprecognitive\u201d, according to which the\nplay of the faculties is a preconceptual state, falling short of\ncognition (for example his own 1979 account),;\n\u201cmulticognitive\u201d, in which the free play represents the\nplayful application of a multiplicity of concepts, and thus a kind of\ncognitive excess (for example Allison 2001); and\n\u201cmetacognitive\u201d, in which the manifold is represented as\nhaving a unity which goes beyond what is required for cognition;\nGuyer\u2019s own view in his 2006, in contrast to that of his 1979,\nfavours the latter approach. Guyer (2009) discusses a further variety\nof approaches; more recent discussions include Gorodeisky (2010,\n2011), Matherne (2014), K\u00fcplen (2015), Ostaric (2017), and\nFilieri (2021).\n2.3.3 The intentionality of the pleasure\n\nDoes the feeling of pleasure in a judgment of taste have intentional\ncontent? According to Guyer, the answer is no (see especially 1979\n[1997: 88\u201397]). Although Kant sometimes describes the pleasure\nas awareness of the free play of the faculties, Guyer takes the\nrelation between the free play and the feeling of pleasure to be\nmerely causal. The pleasure is \u201copaque\u201d, or lacks\nintentional content: while one can come to recognize that one\u2019s\nfeeling of pleasure is due to the free play, this is not because the\npleasure makes one immediately aware of it, but rather because\nreflection on the causal history of one\u2019s pleasure can lead one\nto conclude that it was not sensory or due to the satisfaction of a\ndesire and hence (by elimination) must have been due to the free\nplay.\n\nWhile some commentators have shared Guyer\u2019s view that the\npleasure is \u201copaque\u201d, and hence that having a feeling of\npleasure does not enable us to know what kind of pleasure we are\nfeeling (see, e.g., Matherne 2019: 9\u201310), others have argued for\nthe intentionality of the pleasure, holding that the pleasure is\nintentionally directed towards the object, or towards its formal\nstructure (Aquila 1982) or that it makes us aware of the free play\n(Allison 2001, in particular 53\u201354 and 122\u2013123). Hughes\n(2017) argues that it is intentionally directed both to the object\nperceived as beautiful, and to the activity of the faculties in their\nfree play. Zuckert (2002) argues that, for Kant, pleasure in general,\nand not just pleasure in the beautiful, is intentional, in that it\nmakes us aware of our wanting to continue in our mental state (that of\nfeeling of the pleasure); Zuckert develops the argument further in her\n2007a, ch. 6. Cveji\u0107 (2021) agrees with Zuckert that pleasure is\nintentional, but argues that the intentionality is of a distinctive\nkind, characteristic only of feelings, and unlike the intentionality\nof cognitive representations. A. Cohen (2020) also argues that\npleasure in the beautiful, and feelings more generally for Kant, are\nintentional, but she denies that the intentionality is intrinsic,\ntaking it, rather, to be derived from our reflective interpretation of\nthose feelings. Cohen\u2019s view is discussed in Merritt 2021 and\nEran 2021.\n2.3.4 The character of the claim to agreement\n\nWhat kind of claim to agreement is made by a judgment of taste? Kant\nseems to suggest that a judgment of taste demands agreement in the\nsame way that an objective cognitive judgment demands agreement (see,\ne.g., Introduction VII, 191 and \u00a76, 211): just as, in claiming\nthat a perceived object is green or square, I take it that everyone\nelse ought to share my judgment that the object is green or square,\nso, in judging an object to be beautiful, I claim that all other\nperceivers of the object should find it beautiful too. But even if\nthis is granted, one might still raise questions about the character\nof the demand, either because there are in turn questions to be raised\nabout what it is for a cognitive judgment to claim agreement, or\nbecause it is not clear that the claim can in fact be the same, given\nthat in the aesthetic case one is claiming that others share\none\u2019s feeling, as opposed to demanding that they apply\nthe same concept to the object. Guyer (1979) argues that the claim\nshould be understood as a rational expectation or ideal prediction\nrather than as a normative demand: someone who judges an object to be\nbeautiful is claiming that under ideal circumstances everyone\nwill share her pleasure (1979 [1997: 123\u2013130 and\n144\u2013147]). Savile (1987) and Chignell (2007) follow Guyer in\nunderstanding the claim in this way; Harbin (2020), while not\nendorsing the \u201cideal prediction\u201d interpretation proposed\nby Guyer, agrees with him in rejecting the view that judgments of\nbeauty make a genuinely normative claim on others\u2019 agreement;\nFeloj (2020) holds a similar view. Harbin\u2019s argument is\nchallenged in Dunn 2020.\n\nGuyer\u2019s understanding of the claim to agreement made by a\njudgment of beauty has been criticized by a number of commentators,\nincluding Rogerson (1982), Ginsborg (1990a: ch. 2), Rind (2002), and\nKalar (2006: ch. 1). A basic difficulty is that it apparently fails to\ndo justice to the normative language used by Kant to describe the\ndemand: for example that anyone who declares something to be beautiful\nholds that everyone ought to [sollen] give his approval to\nthe object and likewise declare it beautiful (\u00a719, 5: 237).\n(Chaouli 2017 surveys the various normative terms used by Kant in this\nconnection and discusses their significance; see ch. 3, 51\u201353.)\nRogerson proposes instead that a judgment of beauty makes a moral\ndemand on others to appreciate the object\u2019s beauty, so that the\n\u201cought\u201d is to be understood as rational, and more\nspecifically moral, rather than merely predictive. The other critics\nmentioned take the \u201cought\u201d, and the corresponding claim to\nagreement to be non-moral, yet still genuinely normative as opposed to\npredictive; a view of this kind is assumed, with varying degrees of\nexplicitness, by a number of other commentators, including Allison\n(2001, see especially 159 and 178\u2013179; 2006, 132).\n\nBut this approach, which is perhaps closest to the letter of\nKant\u2019s text, raises a question: what kind of normativity is\nthis, if not that associated with morality or, more generally,\npractical rationality? It is tempting to assimilate it to cognitive or\nepistemic normativity, where this in turn might be understood as the\nnormativity involved in the putative principles that one ought to\nbelieve what is true, or, alternatively, what is justified in light of\nthe evidence. However this appears to conflict with Kant\u2019s\ncommitment to the subjectivity and (relatedly) nonconceptuality of\njudgments of taste. To avoid the conflict, while preserving the link\nKant seems to assert between the normativity of aesthetic judgment and\nthat of cognitive judgment, we need an understanding of the\nnormativity such that it is a necessary condition of cognition that we\nbe able to make such normative demands for agreement, yet without the\nnormativity\u2019s simply being identified with the cognitive or\nepistemic normativity associated with truth and justification.\nGinsborg (2006) identifies it with what she calls the\n\u201cprimitive\u201d normativity required for empirical\nconceptualization: our grasp of empirical concepts depends on the\npossibility of making such primitively normative claims, but they do\nnot in turn presuppose cognition, which leaves open the possibility\nthat such a claim is implicit in aesthetic experience and\njudgment.\n\nGranted, pace Guyer, that the claim is normative without\nbeing moral, further questions can be raised about its strength and\ncharacter. Moran (2012) understands the demand as reflecting a sense\nof obligation or requirement, distinct from moral obligation, but\nstronger than that present in the case of empirical cognitive\njudgment. He reads Kant as drawn towards a view on which the beautiful\nobject itself makes an unconditional demand on the viewer\u2019s\nattention (of a kind made vivid in the narrator\u2019s vow to the\nhawthorns in Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time), although\nhe also takes Kant\u2019s denial of the objectivity of taste to debar\nhim from endorsing such a view. A similar suggestion is made in Makkai\n(2010): she takes Kant to hint at the idea that the beautiful object\nis found to deserve, or call for, recognition as beautiful, where this\nimplies a claim on the viewer which goes beyond any claim implicit in\nan objective judgment. Roughly, on the view suggested by Moran and\nMakkai, the claim implicit in a judgment of beauty is not merely the\nconditional claim that others, if they perceive the object, ought to\njudge it to be beautiful; it is the unconditional claim that others\nought to perceive it and, in so doing, judge it to be beautiful. The\nidea that Kant takes us to be subject to a demand to attend to\nbeautiful objects is also put forward in Kalar 2006, but Kalar\nunderstands that demand as one of two distinct normative demands made\nin the judgment of beauty: a non-moral demand to feel pleasure in the\ngiven object, and a further moral demand to attend to the object\n(2006: 2). Makkai (2021) develops further the view that the object has\na claim on us (although she does not see it as a moral claim); Lopes\n(2021) seems also to assume such a claim.\n2.3.5 Is beauty objective?\n\nShould judgments of beauty be regarded as objective? Ameriks has\nargued (1982, 1983, 1998, 2000) that in spite of Kant\u2019s claim\nthat judgments of beauty are \u201csubjectively grounded\u201d, they\nare nonetheless objective in the same sense that judgments of colour\nand other secondary qualities are objective. Similar views are\nproposed in Savile 1981 and Kulenkampff 1990; see also the references\noffered by Ameriks at (2003: 307n.1). The claim is challenged by\nGinsborg (1998), who defends the subjectivity of taste on the grounds\nthat Kant does not allow that we can make judgments of beauty on the\nbasis of hearsay, but must \u201csubject the object to our own\neyes\u201d (\u00a78, 5:215\u2013216); a similar point is made in\nHopkins 2001, and there is further discussion of aesthetic testimony\nin Gorodeisky 2009. Ameriks responds to Ginsborg\u2019s challenge in\nhis 1998; the objectivity of taste is defended further in Makkai 2010.\nGinsborg offers further defence of the subjectivity of taste in her\n2017; her approach is challenged in chapter 3 of Makkai 2021.\n\nThe question of whether Kant should be interpreted as committed to the\nobjectivity of taste is closely related to the question of whether\nthere can be erroneous judgments of taste; for some discussion see T.\nCohen (1982: 222\u2013226) and Allison (2001: 107\u2013108). It is\nalso related to the question of aesthetic normativity (see\n Section 2.3.4\n above) and to that of the \u201cautonomy of taste\u201d (the\nsupposed independence of our judgments of taste both from testimony\nand from the judgments of experts), which is discussed in Matherne\n2019.\n2.3.6 Negative judgments of beauty\n\nKant\u2019s discussion of judgments of beauty focusses almost\nexclusively on the positive judgment that an object is beautiful, and\nrelatedly, of the feeling of pleasure in a beautiful object. He has\nvery little to say about the judgment that an object is not beautiful,\nor about the displeasure associated with judging an object to be ugly.\n(As noted in\n Section 2.7\n below, he does take the appreciation of the sublime to involve a kind\nof displeasure, but this seems to be a different kind from the\ndispleasure that might be involved in judging something to be ugly.)\nDoes his treatment allow for negative judgments of beauty, either that\nan object is not beautiful or that it is ugly? Shier (1998) argues\nthat it does not, but this has been challenged by Allison (2001), who\ntakes it to be a criterion for a satisfactory interpretation of\nKant\u2019s theory of taste that it allow for negative judgments of\nbeauty (2001: 72; see also 184\u2013186). Others who have emphasized\nthe need to consider the role of the ugly in Kant\u2019s account of\naesthetics include Hudson (1991), Wenzel (1999) and K\u00fcplen\n(2015).\n\nIt is useful, in considering this topic, to distinguish the question\nof how we can judge that something is not beautiful, from that of how\nwe can judge it to be ugly. The former question can be seen an aspect\nof a more general problem about how we can make judgments in which\nascriptions of beauty figure in embedded contexts, for example as the\nantecedents of conditionals; this is akin to what is often referred to\nas the Frege-Geach problem for expressivist accounts of normative\ndiscourse. The second question is more specific and can be framed in\nterms of aesthetic experience: can Kant allow for an experience of\ndispleasure in the ugly, and if he can, is it symmetrical with\npleasure in the beautiful?\n\nSome commentators, for example Brandt (1994), Ginsborg (2003:\n175\u2013177), and Guyer (2005b: ch. 6), have denied that there is\nsuch a thing, for Kant, as pure displeasure in the ugly, or,\ncorrelatively a pure judgment of ugliness. Guyer argues that while\nthere is displeasure in the ugly it always involves an interest;\nGinsborg allows also for disinterested judgments of ugliness, but\ndenies that these involve a characteristic feeling of displeasure;\nrather, we judge that something is ugly if it lacks beauty in a\ncontext where beauty is expected. More generally, on her view, aside\nfrom cases where the judgment is based on perception of an object as\nharmful or disgusting, judgments of the ugly depend on recognition of\nthe context in which the object is presented; Gracyk defends a similar\npoint, using it to argue that \u201cugly\u201d objects are those\nwhich resist unification and are thus less pleasurable to perceive\nthan other objects (1986: 55). Guyer\u2019s view is criticized in\nMcConnell 2008, which offers a useful survey of previous discussions\nof the issue, and (partly drawing on Gracyk 1986) provides a defence\nof pure judgments of ugliness which appeals to Kant\u2019s theory of\naesthetic ideas. A. Cohen (2013) suggests that there can be both\nimpure and pure judgments of ugliness, arguing for the possibility of\na \u201cfoul play\u201d of the faculties in which the play of\nimagination and understanding is hindered rather than facilitated and\nstand in reciprocal disharmony.\n2.3.7 What is the \u201ccommon sense\u201d?\n\nIn the Fourth Moment of the Analytic of the Beautiful, at \u00a720,\nKant claims that judgments of taste rely on a \u201csubjective\nprinciple\u201d which \u201cdetermines only by feeling rather than\nconcepts\u201d, and that such a principle must be regarded as a\n\u201ccommon sense\u201d (sensus communis) (\u00a720, 238).\nHe goes on at \u00a721, in an argument often regarded as anticipating\nthe Deduction of Taste at \u00a738, to argue that we must assume a\n\u201ccommon sense\u201d as a condition of the universal\ncommunicability of cognition. But in order to make sense of the\nargument, we must be able to understand Kant\u2019s notion of a\n\u201ccommon sense\u201d, and this proves to be challenging. In\nparticular, if the common sense introduced at \u00a720 is a principle\nfor judging by feeling, then\u2014assuming, with most commentators,\nthat what Kant means by \u201cfeeling\u201d is the feeling of\npleasure\u2014it seems implausible to suppose that it is a condition\nfor claiming the universal communicability or universal validity of\nour cognitive judgments. For it seems that we do not need to feel\npleasure in order to determine, in the case of a cognitive judgment,\nwhether it is one that everyone else should share. This raises the\nquestion whether the notion of \u201ccommon sense\u201d\u2014to\nwhich Kant also returns in \u00a740\u2014is in fact univocal, or\nwhether, as proposed by Allison (2001: 153\u2013154), there are two\ndifferent species of common sense: one required for the universal\ncommunicability of judgments of beauty, and one required for the\nuniversal communicability of cognition.\n\nA second question associated with the notion of a common sense, raised\nby Guyer (1979 [1997: 249\u2013250]) and discussed recently in\nMatherne 2019, is that of its ontological status, given that Kant\nrefers to it variously as as a \u201cfeeling\u201d, a\n\u201cprinciple\u201d and a \u201cfaculty\u201d.\n\nA third question, discussed in detail by Guyer (1979 [1997:\n264\u2013273]) and Matherne (2019) is raised by Kant himself in\n\u00a722: whether the common sense, understood as a principle or\nstandard, is regulative or constitutive. This question, which Kant\nleaves unanswered, is especially puzzling because it appears from\n\u00a721 that Kant already takes himself to have established that the\ncommon sense is a condition of the universal communicability of\ncognition.\n\nFollowing Guyer\u2019s own assessment of the common sense as an\n\u201cunnecessary detour\u201d (1979 [1997: 274]) in the overall\nargument of the Deduction, many commentators have disregarded the\ncommon sense in their discussions of Kant\u2019s theory of taste.\nRecently, however, there has been much more attention to the notion of\nthe common sense. Matherne (2019), who follows Allison in\ndistinguishing an aesthetic from a cognitive common sense, takes\naesthetic common sense as something that we acquire (thus as\nregulative rather than constitutive), and invokes it to help make\nsense of Kant\u2019s view that taste is autonomous. Makkai (2021: ch.\n4) examines and rejects Allison\u2019s distinction between an\naesthetic and cognitive common sense, arguing that \u00a721 points to\na parallel between cognition and taste in that both require a feeling\nof \u201cwhat\u2026calls for judging\u201d or \u201cwhat\nmatters\u201d (159). Sethi (forthcoming) also rejects the\ndistinction, pointing out that the need for it is premised on the\nassumption that the \u201cfeeling\u201d invoked at \u00a720 must be\na feeling of pleasure, and arguing (drawing in part on Sethi 2019)\nthat the feeling of the free play of the faculties is not a feeling of\npleasure (see\n Section 2.3.1).\n She takes the common sense to be necessary for empirical\nconcept-acquisition, so that the notion of common sense plays a\ncrucial role in accounting for the relation between taste and\ncognition.\n2.3.8 Universal validity and universal communicability\n\nKant describes judgments of beauty both as \u201cuniversally\nvalid\u201d and as \u201cuniversally communicable\u201d. Many\ncommentators have treated these expressions as more or less\nequivalent, and Guyer (1979 [1997: 251\u2013252]) points out several\npassages where Kant seems to use them interchangeably. (For the most\npart, this article follows this way of understanding the\nexpressions.)\n\nHowever, several commentators have argued recently that it is\nimportant to distinguish these two notions. The universal\ncommunicability of a judgment of beauty is not just a matter of its\nclaiming universal validity, but has to do with the possibility of\nliterally communicating our feeling in the object; for example\nbringing it about that another person can share it. Commentators who\nhave emphasized this distinction include Makkai (2021: ch. 2),\nVaccarino Bremner (forthcoming), and Sethi (forthcoming).\n2.4 Judgments of Beauty: Some Criticisms\n\nAs noted at the end of\n Section 2.2,\n Kant\u2019s account of judgments of beauty has been criticized on\nthe grounds that the argument for their universal validity, that is\nthe Deduction of Pure Aesthetic Judgments, is unsuccessful. Criticisms\nhave also been raised against various aspects of Kant\u2019s\ncharacterization of judgments of beauty in the Analytic of the\nBeautiful. Objections have been raised in particular to Kant\u2019s\nview that judgments of beauty are disinterested, and to his supposed\ncommitment to aesthetic formalism (the view that all that matters for\naesthetic appreciation is the abstract formal pattern manifested by\nthe object, that is, the way in which its elements are interrelated in\nspace and/or time). For discussion of the questions of\ndisinterestedness and formalism, see Guyer (1979 [1997: chs. 5 and\n6]), and Allison (2001: chs. 4 and 5); Zuckert offers a sympathetic\nreading of Kant\u2019s formalism (2007a: 182\u2013189). Kant\u2019s\nformalism was particularly influential, via the influence of Hanslick,\nin musical theory; for discussion see Kivy (2009: ch. 2). Discussions\nof this topic often note that although the Analytic of the Beautiful\nputs forward a formalist view, Kant\u2019s treatment of aesthetic\nideas (discussed in\n Section 2.6)\n is more congenial to an expressivist view of art.\n\nTypically objections to Kant\u2019s view of pleasure as disinterested\nappeal to the apparently obvious fact that we do in fact take an\ninterest in the preservation of beautiful objects (see for example\nCrawford 1974: 53). A different kind of objection, based on an appeal\nto the cognitive role of aesthetic judging, is made in Pillow\n2006.\n\nKant has also been criticized for a view that is taken to be a\nconsequence of the thesis that judgments of beauty are disinterested,\nnamely the view that aesthetic experience requires a special attitude\nof \u201cpsychical distance\u201d or \u201cdetachment\u201d from\nthe object appreciated: this criticism is generally taken to be\nimplicit in Dickie\u2019s well-known (1964) discussion of the\n\u201cmyth of the aesthetic attitude\u201d. Zangwill (1992) argues\nthat this criticism is misplaced.\n\nKant\u2019s view that the pleasure in a beautiful object is\nnon-conceptual has been taken to commit him to the supposedly\nobjectionable view that the capacity to make conceptual distinctions\ncan play no role in the appreciation of beauty. This criticism, made\nby Wollheim (1980) (invoking the idea that aesthetic appreciation\ndemands an \u201cempty cognitive stock\u201d) is addressed in\nJanaway 1997. Relatedly, it has been objected that Kant does not allow\nroom for reason-giving, and more generally, criticism in aesthetics;\nthat objection is addressed in Crawford 1970 and (on lines suggested\nby Crawford) in Wilson 2007. Further defence and explication of a\nKantian approach to art criticism is offered in Tuna 2016.\n\nBaz (2005) criticizes Kant for his apparent view that the value of\nbeauty lies in its relation to cognition, rather than the beautiful\nobject\u2019s mattering for its own sake; Hughes (2006) offers a\nresponse.\n2.5 Free and Adherent Beauty\n\nThis article so far has been concerned primarily with pure judgments\nof beauty. But Kant also allows for judgments of beauty which are not\npure. Judgments of beauty can fail to be pure in two ways.\n\nThey can be influenced by the object\u2019s sensory or emotional\nappeal, that is, they can involve \u201ccharm\u201d [Reiz]\nor emotion [R\u00fchrung] (\u00a713).\nThey can be contingent on a certain concept\u2019s applying to\nthe object, so that the object is judged, not as beautiful tout\ncourt, but as beautiful qua belonging to this or that\nkind.\n\n\nThe second kind of impurity is discussed in \u00a716 in connection\nwith a distinction between \u201cfree\u201d [frei] beauty\nand \u201cadherent\u201d or \u201cdependent\u201d\n[anh\u00e4ngend] beauty.\n\nOne reason to think that the distinction is important is that Kant\nseems to suggest that all judgments of beauty about representational\nart are judgments of adherent rather than of free beauty, and hence\nthat they are all impure. (This is questioned by Tuna (2018), who\nholds that works of art which result from genius can be regarded as\ninstances of free rather than adherent beauty.) While some art works\ncan be \u201cfree beauties\u201d, the examples Kant gives are all of\nnon-representational art: \u201cdesigns a la grecque, foliage for\nborders or on wallpaper\u2026fantasias in music\u201d, and indeed,\nKant adds, all music without a text (\u00a716, 229). It might be\nsupposed from this that Kant\u2019s core account of judgments of\nbeauty is only peripherally applicable to art, which would make it\nlargely irrelevant to the concerns of contemporary aesthetics.\nHowever, this consequence is debatable. For example, Allison argues\nthat judgments of adherent beauty contain, as a component, a pure\njudgment of beauty. The purity of this core judgment is not undermined\nby its figuring in a more complex evaluation which takes into account\nthe object\u2019s falling under a concept (2001: 140\u2013141).\n\nKant\u2019s suggestion that representational art has\n\u201cadherent\u201d rather than \u201cfree\u201d beauty, and that\njudgments about such art fail to be pure, might also invite the\nobjection that Kant takes nonrepresentational art to be superior to\nrepresentational art, so that, say, wallpaper designs are\naesthetically more valuable than the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.\nThis objection is challenged by Schaper (1979: ch. 4, reprinted in\nGuyer 2003a) and by Guyer (2005b: chs. 4 and 5). Tuna (2018) adopts a\ndifferent approach to the underlying problem by arguing that works of\nart, if they are works of genius, should not be viewed as cases of\nadherent beauty in the first place.\n\nFurther discussions of the distinction between free and adherent\nbeauty include Scarre (1981), Lorand (1989), Gammon (1999), Guyer\n(2002a), Kalar (2006: 82\u201389), Zuckert (2007a: 202\u2013212),\nand Rueger (2008). Clewis (2018) provides useful historical context\nfor the distinction.\n2.6 Art, Genius and Aesthetic Ideas\n\nWhile Kant attaches special importance to the beauty of nature (see,\ne.g., FI XI, 20:244), he also makes clear that judgments of beauty may\nbe made also about \u201cfine\u201d or \u201cbeautiful\u201d art\n[sch\u00f6ne Kunst]. In the course of his treatment of\nbeautiful art in \u00a7\u00a743\u201354 he discusses fine art in\nrelation to the production of human artifacts more generally\n(\u00a743), compares fine art to the \u201carts\u201d of\nentertaining (telling jokes, decorating a table, providing background\nmusic) (\u00a744), and makes some remarks about the relation between\nthe beauty of art and that of nature, claiming in particular that fine\nart must \u201clook to us like nature\u201d in that it must seem\nfree and unstudied (\u00a745). Kant also offers a typology of the\nvarious fine arts (\u00a751) and a comparison of their respective\naesthetic value (\u00a753), with poetry at the top and music\u2014at\nleast as far as the \u201ccultivation of the mind\u201d is\nconcerned\u2014at the bottom. Kant\u2019s remarks about music in\n\u00a7\u00a751\u201354 suggest that music might not even qualify as\nbeautiful, as opposed to merely agreeable, art. This is seemingly in\ntension with Kant\u2019s reference to music without words as an\nexample of \u201cfree beauty\u201d (\u00a716, 5:229).\n\nOf particular interest, within Kant\u2019s account of fine art, is\nhis discussion of how beautiful art objects can be produced\n(\u00a7\u00a746\u201350). The artist cannot produce a beautiful work\nby learning, and then applying, rules which determine when something\nis beautiful; for no such rules can be specified (see the sketch of\nthe Second Moment in\n Section 2.1\n above). But, Kant makes clear, the artist\u2019s activity must still\nbe rule-governed, since \u201cevery art presupposes rules\u201d\n(\u00a746, 307) and the objects of art must serve as models or\nexamples, that is, they must serve as a \u201cstandard or rule by\nwhich to judge\u201d (\u00a746, 308). Kant\u2019s solution to this\napparent paradox is to postulate a capacity, which he calls\n\u201cgenius\u201d, by which \u201cnature gives the rule to\nart\u201d (\u00a746, 307). An artist endowed with genius has a\nnatural capacity to produce objects which are appropriately judged as\nbeautiful, and this capacity does not require the artist him- or\nherself to consciously follow rules for the production of such\nobjects; in fact the artist himself does not know, and so cannot\nexplain, how he or she was able to bring them into being.\n\u201cGenius\u201d here means something different from brilliance of\nintellect. For example, Newton, for all his intellectual power, does\nnot qualify as having genius, because he was capable of making clear,\nboth to himself and others, the procedures through which he arrived at\nhis scientific discoveries (\u00a747, 308\u2013309).\n\nA further point of interest in Kant\u2019s discussion of art is his\nclaim that beauty is the \u201cexhibition\u201d\n[Darstellung, also translated \u201cpresentation\u201d]\n(\u00a749, 314) or \u201cexpression\u201d (\u00a751, 319) of\naesthetic ideas. Kant describes an aesthetic idea as\n\n\na representation of the imagination that occasions much thinking,\nthough without it being possible for any determinate thought, i.e.,\nconcept, to be adequate to it. (\u00a749, 314)\n\n\nSuch ideas, he says, are a \u201ccounterpart\u201d to rational\nideas, that is, representations which cannot be exemplified in\nexperience or by means of imagination (ibid.). While part of\nKant\u2019s point here is to contrast aesthetic and rational ideas,\nit is clear that he sees the role of aesthetic ideas as mediating\nbetween rational ideas on the one hand, and sensibility and\nimagination on the other. A work of art expresses or exhibits an\naesthetic idea in so far as it succeeds in giving sensible form to a\nrational idea. Thus aesthetic ideas \u201cseek to approximate to an\nexhibition\u201d of rational ideas. For example, the poet\n\n\nventures to make sensible rational ideas of invisible beings, the\nrealm of the blessed, the realm of hell, eternity, creation etc., as\nwell as to make that of which there are examples in experience, e.g.,\ndeath, envy, and all sorts of vices, as well as love, fame, etc.,\nsensible beyond the limits of experience, with a completeness which\ngoes beyond anything of which there is an example in nature.\n(ibid.)\n\n\nOne question raised in connection with Kant\u2019s account of fine\nart concerns the relative importance, for Kant, of artistic and\nnatural beauty. Guyer (1987) takes Kant to be committed to the primacy\nof natural beauty, and argues that that commitment is defensible;\nKemal (1986) offers grounds for holding that, in spite of appearances,\nit is artistic beauty which is primary for Kant. (The reprint of Guyer\n1987 as ch. 7 of Guyer 1993 includes a postscript challenging\nKemal\u2019s arguments.) Other commentators who have argued for the\nprimacy of artistic over natural beauty include Rueger (2007) and\nOstaric (2010). Friedlander (2015: ch. 3) maintains that neither has\nprimacy over the other. Another question is whether Kant has a single\naccount of beauty which is intended to apply to both natural objects\nand works of art; Reiter and Geiger (2018) and Halper (2020) argue,\nalthough on different grounds, that Kant has two different accounts\nfor nature and art respectively.\n\nCommentators have also discussed Kant\u2019s ranking of the fine\narts, and particularly of the low ranking he accords to music; on the\nlatter topic, see for example Weatherston (1996), Parret (1998b), Kivy\n(2009: ch. 2), Tuna (2018), and K\u00fcplen (2021). Kant\u2019s views\non music have sometimes been criticized as incoherent; Matherne (2014)\noffers a explicit defence.\n\nKant\u2019s theory of aesthetic ideas has been regarded by many\ncommentators as peripheral to his aesthetic theory, but a number of\ncommentators have argued that it is necessary in order to make sense\nof the core of Kant\u2019s view of pure judgments of taste; see for\nexample Savile (1987), Rogerson (2004 and 2008), Rueger and Evren\n(2005), Kalar (2006), and Chignell (2007). More recently, the topic of\naesthetic ideas has received considerable attention in its own right.\nOne issue concerns the role of aesthetic ideas in the beauty of\nnature, as opposed to that of art. While aesthetic ideas are discussed\nonly in the sections of the Critique of Judgment which deal\nwith artistic beauty, and not in the \u201cAnalytic of the\nBeautiful\u201d, which deals with beauty more generally, Kant remarks\nparenthetically that natural as well as artistic beauty is the\nexpression of aesthetic ideas (\u00a751, 321). How are we to conceive\nof the aesthetic ideas expressed by nature? Reiter (2018) and Reiter\nand Geiger (2018) propose an interpretation in terms of the notion of\nan \u201caesthetic normal idea\u201d introduced by Kant in the Third\nMoment, at \u00a717, 233, which they relate to a notion of\n\u201cideal form\u201d that was current in art theory at\nKant\u2019s time.\n\nA related issue concerns the scope of aesthetic ideas. Matherne (2013)\nchallenges interpretations on which aesthetic ideas can present or\nexpress only moral or rational concepts, arguing that they can also\npresent empirical concepts and human emotions. Reiter and Geiger\n(2018) also propose expanding the scope of what can be presented in an\naesthetic idea, arguing that, insofar as aesthetic ideas present the\nrational idea of humanity in our person, they show the \u201crange\nand variety of human freedom\u201d. Vaccarino Bremner\n(2021) suggests a different way of broadening the scope of\naesthetic ideas, arguing that they do not just present or express\nconcepts, but call for us to revise them.\n\nTraditionally, Kant\u2019s aesthetics has been seen as most readily\napplicable to art of his time and (because of his apparent formalism)\nto abstract art of the modernist period. Costello (2013) argues for\nthe applicability of Kant\u2019s theory of aesthetics to conceptual\nart. For further recent discussions of the applicability of\nKant\u2019s aesthetics to contemporary art, including conceptual and\npost-conceptual art, see the essays collected in Cazeaux 2021.\n2.7 The Sublime\n\nKant distinguishes two notions of the sublime: the mathematically\nsublime and the dynamically sublime. In the case of both notions, the\nexperience of the sublime consists in a feeling of the superiority of\nour own power of reason, as a supersensible faculty, over nature\n(\u00a728, 261).\n\nIn the case of the mathematically sublime, the feeling of\nreason\u2019s superiority over nature takes the form, more\nspecifically, of a feeling of reason\u2019s superiority to\nimagination, conceived of as the natural capacity required for sensory\napprehension, including the apprehension of the magnitudes of\nempirically given things. We have this feeling when we are confronted\nwith something that is so large that it overwhelms imagination\u2019s\ncapacity to comprehend it. In such a situation imagination strives to\ncomprehend the object in accordance with a demand of reason, but fails\nto do so.\n\n\nJust because there is in our imagination a striving to advance to the\ninfinite, while in our reason there lies a claim to absolute totality,\nas to a real idea, the very inadequacy of our faculty for estimating\nthe magnitude of the things in the sensible world [viz., imagination]\nawakens the feeling of a supersensible faculty in us. (\u00a725,\n250)\n\n\nThe fact that we are capable, through reason, of thinking infinity as\na whole, \u201cindicates a faculty of the mind which surpasses every\nstandard of sense\u201d (\u00a726, 254). While Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of the mathematically sublime mentions the Pyramids in\nEgypt and St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome (\u00a726, 252), it is\nnot clear that these are intended as examples of the sublime; and Kant\nclaims explicitly that the most appropriate examples are of things in\nnature. More specifically, they must be natural things the concept of\nwhich does not involve the idea of a purpose (\u00a726,\n252\u2013253): this rules out animals, the concept of which is\nconnected with the idea of biological function, but it apparently\nincludes mountains and the sea (\u00a726, 256).\n\nIn the case of the dynamically sublime, the feeling of reason\u2019s\nsuperiority to nature is more direct than in the mathematical case.\nKant says that we consider nature as \u201cdynamically sublime\u201d\nwhen we consider it as \u201ca power that has no dominion over\nus\u201d (\u00a728, 260). We have the feeling of the dynamically\nsublime when we experience nature as fearful while knowing ourselves\nto be in a position of safety and hence without in fact being afraid.\nIn this situation\n\n\nthe irresistibility of [nature\u2019s] power certainly makes us,\nconsidered as natural beings, recognize our physical powerlessness,\nbut at the same time it reveals a capacity for judging ourselves as\nindependent of nature and a superiority over nature\u2026whereby the\nhumanity in our person remains undemeaned even though the human being\nmust submit to that dominion. (\u00a728, 261\u2013262)\n\n\nKant\u2019s examples include overhanging cliffs, thunder clouds,\nvolcanoes and hurricanes (\u00a728, 261).\n\nThe feeling associated with the sublime is a feeling of pleasure in\nthe superiority of our reason over nature, but it also involves\ndispleasure. In the case of the mathematically sublime, the\ndispleasure comes from the awareness of the inadequacy of our\nimagination; in the dynamical case it comes from the awareness of our\nphysical powerlessness in the face of nature\u2019s might. Kant is\nnot consistent in his descriptions of how the pleasure and the\ndispleasure are related, but one characterization describes them as\nalternating: the \u201cmovement of the mind\u201d in the\nrepresentation of the sublime\n\n\nmay be compared to a vibration, i.e., to a rapidly alternating\nrepulsion from and attraction to one and the same object. (\u00a727,\n258)\n\n\nKant also describes the feeling of the sublime as a \u201cpleasure\nwhich is possible only by means of a displeasure\u201d (\u00a727,\n260) and as a \u201cnegative liking\u201d (General Remark following\n\u00a729, 269). He also appears to identify it with the feeling of\nrespect, which in his practical philosophy is associated with\nrecognition of the moral law (\u00a727, 257).\n\nJudgments of the sublime are like judgments of beauty in being based\non feeling, more specifically on pleasure or liking. They are also\nlike judgments of beauty in claiming the universal validity of the\npleasure, where that claim is understood as involving necessity\n(everyone who perceives the object ought to share the feeling)\n(\u00a729, 266). But as we have seen, the pleasure is different in\nthat it involves a negative element. The following differences should\nalso be noted:\n\n(particularly emphasized by Kant) In making a judgment of the\nsublime, we regard the object as \u201ccontrapurposive\u201d, rather\nthan purposive, for the faculties of imagination and judgment\n(\u00a723, 245). While judgments of the sublime do involve the\nrepresentation of purposiveness, the purposiveness differs from that\ninvolved in a judgment of beauty in two ways.\n\n\nIt is not the object, but the aesthetic judgment itself which is\nrepresented as purposive.\nThe aesthetic judgment is represented as purposive not for\nimagination or judgment, but for reason (\u00a727, 260) or for the\n\u201cwhole vocation of the mind\u201d (\u00a727, 259).\n \nThe claim to universal validity made by a judgment of the sublime\nrests, not on the universal validity of the conditions of cognition,\nbut rather on the universal validity of moral feeling (\u00a729,\n255\u2013256).\nWhile we can correctly call objects beautiful, we cannot properly\ncall them sublime (\u00a723, 245); sublimity strictly speaking\n\u201cis not contained in anything in nature, but only in our\nmind\u201d (\u00a728, 264). This means, according to Kant, that there\nis no need for a deduction of the sublime.\nWhile judgments of beauty involve a relation between the faculties\nof imagination and understanding, the faculties brought into relation\nin a judgment of the sublime are imagination and reason (\u00a729,\n266).\n\n\nThe importance of the sublime within Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory is\na matter of dispute. In the Introductions to the Critique of\nJudgment, Kant has a great deal to say about the beautiful, but\nmentions the sublime only fleetingly (FI XII, 249\u2013250) and in\nthe Analytic of the Sublime itself he notes that\n\n\nthe concept of the sublime in nature is far from being as important\nand rich in consequences as that of its beauty\n\n\nand that the\n\n\ntheory of the sublime is a mere appendix to the aesthetic judging of\nthe purposiveness of nature. (\u00a723, 246)\n\n\nKant\u2019s views about the sublime also appear to be less\nhistorically distinctive than his views about the beautiful, showing\nin particular the influence of Burke. On the other hand, Kant\u2019s\naccount of the sublime has been influential in literary theory (see\n Section 2.9\n below), and the sublime also plays a significant role in Kant\u2019s\naccount of the connection between aesthetic judgment and morality.\nCommentators who have emphasized the importance of the sublime in\nconnection with moral feeling include Clewis (2009) and Matherne\n(forthcoming); the latter explores in particular the experience of the\nsublime as enabling the perception of our own freedom.\n\nOne focus of debate regarding the sublime concerns whether sublimity,\naccording to Kant, is restricted to objects of nature, or whether\nthere can also be sublime art; Abaci (2008) defends Kant\u2019s\nrestriction of sublimity to nature; Clewis (2010) defends the opposite\nview. For discussion of the Kantian sublime as it might apply to\nspecific works of art, see chs. 6 and 7 of Lyotard 1988 [1991] (on\nBarnett Newman\u2019s paintings as an instance of the Kantian\nsublime) and Myskja 2002 (which brings Kant\u2019s notion of the\nsublime to bear on Samuel Beckett\u2019s novel Molloy).\nZuckert 2021 offers a clear and helpful discussion of Lyotard\u2019s\nview of Kant\u2019s account of the sublime in application to art.\n\nAn orthogonal question concerns the proper object of a judgment of the\nsublime (whether of nature or art). We might suppose that it is the\nphysical object occasioning the feeling of the sublime, for example\nSt. Peter\u2019s in Rome, or an erupting volcano. But, as we saw\nabove, Kant says that sublimity does not belong to objects but is\n\u201conly in our mind\u201d (\u00a728, 264). Commentators have\nsuggested various candidates for what is properly called sublime,\nincluding rational ideas, human reason, and the feeling of pleasure\nwhich constitutes our experience of the sublime; for discussion, see\nMoore (2018).\n\nA good overview of Kant\u2019s theory of the sublime and its\nconnection with Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory more generally is\nprovided in Crowther 1989; other useful expositions include Guyer\n(1993: ch. 7), Matthews (1996), Budd (1998), and Allison (2001: ch.\n13). The more recent overview in Merritt 2018 offers a helpful account\nof the historical sources of Kant\u2019s theory, including\nStoicism..\n2.8 Aesthetics and Morality\n\nThe connection between aesthetic judgment and moral feeling is a\npersistent theme in the Critique of Judgment. As noted in\n Section 2.3.4\n above, some commentators take the demand for universal validity made\nby a judgment of beauty to amount to a moral demand, so that\nKant\u2019s argument for the universal validity of such judgments\ndepends on an appeal to morality. A more common view, however, is to\nsee judgments of beauty not as grounded in morality, but rather, along\nwith judgments of the sublime, as contributing to an account of moral\nfeeling, and hence of how morality is possible for human beings (for a\nclear statement of the contrast between these views, see the\nintroduction to Guyer 1993).\n\nThe idea that aesthetic judgment plays a role in grounding the\npossibility of morality for human beings is suggested at a very\ngeneral level in the Introduction to the Critique of\nJudgment, where Kant describes the faculty of judgment as\nbridging \u201cthe great gulf\u201d between the concept of nature\nand that of freedom (IX, 195). While Kant says that the concept or\nprinciple of judgment which mediates the transition between nature and\nfreedom is that of the \u201cpurposiveness of nature\u201d, which\ncould simply be understood as referring to nature\u2019s scientific\ncomprehensibility (see\n Section 3.2\n below), he also associates judgment in this context with the feeling\nof pleasure and displeasure, making clear that it is not only judgment\nin the context of empirical scientific enquiry, but also aesthetic\njudgment, which plays this bridging role.\n\nThe \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d mentions a number of\nmore specific connections between aesthetics and morality, including\nthe following:\n\nAesthetic experience serves as a propadeutic for morality, in that\n\u201cthe beautiful prepares us to love something, even nature,\nwithout interest; the sublime, to esteem it, even contrary to our\n(sensible) interest\u201d (General Remark following \u00a729,\n267).\nThe demand for universal agreement in judgments of the sublime\nrests on an appeal to moral feeling (\u00a729, 265\u2013266)\nTaking a direct interest in the beauty of nature indicates\n\u201ca good soul\u201d and a \u201cmental attunement favorable to\nmoral feeling\u201d (\u00a742, 298\u2013299).\nBeauty serves as the \u201csymbol\u201d of morality (\u00a759,\npassim), in that a judgment of beauty \u201clegislates for\nitself\u201d rather than being \u201csubjected to a heteronomy of\nlaws of experience\u201d (\u00a759, 353); relatedly, feelings of\npleasure in the beautiful are analogous to moral consciousness\n(\u00a759, 354; see also General Comment following \u00a791,\n482n.).\nBeauty gives sensible form to moral ideas (\u00a760, 356); this is\nrelated both to the view that there is an analogy between the\nexperience of beauty and moral feeling (see (ii) above), and to the\nview that beauty is the expression of aesthetic ideas (see\n Section 2.6).\n Because of this, the development of moral ideas is the \u201ctrue\npropadeutic\u201d for taste (\u00a760, 356).\n\n\nThere is an influential discussion of beauty as the symbol of morality\nin T. Cohen (1982). Much of Guyer\u2019s work on the third\nCritique subsequent to his 1979 has emphasized the connection\nbetween aesthetics and morality, and in particular the role of\naesthetics in supporting the human moral vocation. As noted in\n Section 1,\n a number of commentators have seen unity of the Critique of\nJudgment in terms of moral teleology, and their work offers\nfurther discussion of the relation between aesthetics and morality;\nsee\n Section 1\n for references.\n2.9 The Broader Significance of Kant\u2019s Aesthetics\n\nKant himself clearly takes his aesthetic theory to be of central\nimportance for the understanding of the so-called \u201cfaculty of\njudgment\u201d generally (see\n Section 1\n above): this implies that he takes it to be of importance for\nunderstanding empirical scientific enquiry, and in particular for our\nunderstanding of biological phenomena. As noted in\n Section 2.8\n above, there are also significant connections between Kant\u2019s\nviews on aesthetics and his views on ethics, and, as noted in\n Section 1,\n a number of commentators have, in addition, laid special weight on\nthe connection between Kant\u2019s aesthetics and his views on\nempirical cognition. Some commentators have also drawn on Kant\u2019s\naesthetic theory to illuminate specific aspects of Kant\u2019s views\non cognition; for example, Heidemann (2016) draws on Kant\u2019s\naesthetic theory to defend the view that Kant\u2019s theory of\ncognition is nonconceptualist.\n\nMany philosophers have seen Kant\u2019s aesthetics as having\nsignificance for domains of philosophical enquiry outside both\naesthetics and the study of Kant. An important example is Cavell\n(1976: ch. 3), who connects the subjective universality which Kant\nascribes to judgments of beauty with the appeal made, in ordinary\nlanguage philosophy, to \u201cwhat we should say\u201d (see\nespecially 94\u201396). This connection is explored further in Baz\n(2016) and Makkai (2021), both of which draw on Cavell for their\nunderstanding of the philosophical significance of Kant\u2019s\naccount of judgments of beauty. Somewhat relatedly, Bell (1987) draws\na connection between Kant\u2019s view of aesthetic judgment and\nWittgenstein\u2019s rule-following considerations; Ginsborg 2011\ninvokes Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory as a basis for a response to the\nskepticism about rules and meaning which Saul Kripke attributes to\nWittgenstein (Kripke 1982).\n\nIn an influential discussion, Arendt (1982) applies Kant\u2019s\ntheory of aesthetic judgment within the sphere of political\nphilosophy; relatedly, Fleischacker (1999) draws connections between\naesthetic judgment for Kant and moral and political judgment\ngenerally.\n\nThe implications of Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory for the philosophy\nof mathematics and the philosophy of science have been explored in\nBreitenbach 2013 and Breitenbach 2018 respectively;\nBreitenbach argues that, although Kant does not explicitly claim that\nmathematical proofs or scientific theories can be beautiful, we can\nnonetheless, on a Kantian view, feel pleasure in both. As noted in\n Section 1,\n Breitenbach (2021) also argues that the imaginative reflection\ncharacteristic of aesthetic experience also characterizes creativity\nin scientific cognition.\n\nKant\u2019s aesthetic theory has been extensively discussed within\nliterary theory, where there has been particular emphasis on\nKant\u2019s theory of the sublime. See for example Weiskel (1976) and\nHertz (1978), both of which interpret Kant\u2019s account of the\nsublime in psychoanalytic terms, as well as the discussions of the\nKantian sublime in de Man (1990) and Lyotard (1991 [1994]).\nKant\u2019s aesthetic theory more generally is discussed in Derrida\n(1975 [1981] and 1978 [1987]); while the work of Derrida and other\ndeconstructionists has been largely ignored or dismissed by\ncommentators within the analytic tradition of philosophy, it has been\ninfluential among literary theorists.\n3. Teleology\n\nWhile Kant\u2019s ethical theory makes frequent reference to the ends\nor purposes adopted by human beings, the \u201cCritique of\nTeleological Judgment\u201d is concerned with the idea of ends or\npurposes in nature. (For the terms \u201cend\u201d and\n\u201cpurpose\u201d as translations of the German Zweck,\nsee footnote 2.) Among the most striking elements of Kant\u2019s\naccount of natural teleology are (i) his claim, in the \u201cAnalytic\nof Teleological Judgment\u201d, that organisms must be regarded by\nhuman beings in teleological terms, i.e., as \u201cnatural\npurposes\u201d, and (ii) his attempt, in the \u201cDialectic of\nTeleological Judgment\u201d, to reconcile this teleological\nconception of organisms with a mechanistic account of nature. These\nare described here in\n Section 3.3\n and\n Section 3.4,\n respectively. Prior to this,\n Section 3.1\n outlines Kant\u2019s notions of purpose and purposiveness in general\nand\n Section 3.2\n sketches nature\u2019s \u201cpurposiveness for our cognitive\nfaculties\u201d, i.e., its amenability to empirical scientific\nenquiry. The discussion of biological teleology and its relation to\nmechanism in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 is followed by two sections dealing\nwith further aspects of Kant\u2019s teleology:\n Section 3.5\n deals with Kant\u2019s view that nature as a whole may be regarded\nas a system of purposes, and\n Section 3.6\n with the implications of this teleological view of nature for\nmorality and religion.\n Section 3.7\n returns to Kant\u2019s biological teleology, considering briefly its\nimplications for contemporary biological thought.\n3.1 The Notion of Purposiveness\n\nThe notions of purpose or end [Zweck] and of purposiveness\n[Zweckm\u00e4ssigkeit] are defined by Kant in the\n\u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d, in a section entitled\n\u201cOn Purposiveness in General\u201d (\u00a710). A purpose is\n\u201cthe object of a concept, in so far as the concept is seen as\nthe cause of the object\u201d, and purposiveness is \u201cthe\ncausality of a concept with respect to its object\u201d (\u00a710,\n220). But Kant often uses the terms \u201cpurpose\u201d and\n\u201cpurposive\u201d in ways that are related to, but do not quite\nfit, these definitions. In particular \u201cpurpose\u201d is\nsometimes used to apply to the concept rather than the corresponding\nobject (e.g., Introduction IV, 180), and \u201cpurposiveness\u201d\nis usually used to denote, not the causality of the concept, but the\nproperty in virtue of which an object counts as a purpose (e.g., FI\nIX, 234). Kant also characterizes \u201cpurposiveness\u201d as the\n\u201clawfulness of the contingent as such\u201d (FI VI, 217; see\nalso FI VIII, 228, Introduction V, 184, and \u00a776, 404).\n\nKant\u2019s initial definition at \u00a710 suggests that the paradigm\nof a purpose is a human artifact, since this typically comes into\nbeing as a result of the artisan\u2019s having a concept of the\nobject he or she plans to produce, a concept which is thus causally\nefficacious in producing its object. Such an object is the result of\ndesign. But Kant goes on to claim that something can qualify as a\npurpose, or as purposive, not only if it is in fact brought about as a\nresult of design, but if we can conceive its possibility only on the\nassumption that it was produced according to design:\n\n\nan object or a state of mind or even an action\u2026 is called\npurposive merely because its possibility can only be explained and\nconceived by us in so far as we assume at its ground a causality in\naccordance with purposes. (\u00a710, 220)\n\n\nKant thinks that this is the case in particular for organisms, which\nare \u201cnatural purposes\u201d (see\n Section 3.3\n below). But the notion of purposiveness also applies more broadly,\nand Kant distinguishes various different kinds of purposiveness\napplying not only to organisms and artifacts, but also to beautiful\nobjects, to nature as a whole (both in so far as it is comprehensible\nto human beings, and in so far as it is a system of purposes standing\nin purposive relations to one another), to the functioning of our\ncognitive faculties in aesthetic appreciation and empirical scientific\nenquiry, to geometrical figures, and even to objects that are useful\nor agreeable to human beings.\n\nBecause Kant\u2019s terminology is not always consistent, it is\ndifficult to provide a definitive characterization of the various\ntypes of purposiveness. However, the following simplified scheme may\nserve as a guide. The notion of purposiveness is divided in the first\ninstance into subjective and objective\npurposiveness. Both kinds of purposiveness are in turn divided into\nformal and material (or real). The most\nimportant kinds of purposiveness for the concerns of the Critique\nof Judgment are (i) subjective formal purposiveness and (ii)\nobjective material purposiveness. Subjective formal purposiveness\ncorresponds both to the \u201caesthetic\u201d purposiveness\ndisplayed by beautiful objects (or by the activity of our cognitive\nfaculties in the perception of them) and to the \u201clogical\u201d\npurposiveness displayed by nature as a whole in so far as it is\ncomprehensible to human beings (see\n Section 3.2).\n Objective material purposiveness corresponds to the purposiveness\ndisplayed both by organisms qua \u201cnatural purposes\u201d (see\n Section 3.3)\n and by arrangements of natural things or processes which stand to one\nanother in means-end relations (see\n Section 3.5).\n But Kant also allows for subjective material purposiveness, which is\nthe kind of purposiveness exhibited by an agreeable object, i.e., one\nwhich pleases our senses (FI VIII, 224); and for objective formal\npurposiveness, which is exhibited by geometrical figures in virtue of\ntheir fruitfulness for solving mathematical problems (\u00a762).\n\nA further important distinction is that between objective material\npurposiveness which is inner, and objective material\npurposiveness which is merely outer or relative;\nthis distinguishes the kind of purposiveness possessed by organisms\nfrom that in virtue of which one natural thing or process stands in a\nmeans-end relation to another. Kant also claims in one passage (FI\nXII, 249\u2013250) that the distinction between inner and relative\npurposiveness applies to subjective as well as objective\npurposiveness, serving to separate the beautiful from the sublime.\n\nThe distinctions among these various kinds of purposiveness are\ntreated in detail by Marc-Wogau (1938) and Tonelli (1958).\n\nCommentators have disagreed about whether there is any underlying\nphilosophical unity to Kant\u2019s notion of purposiveness, and, in\nparticular, whether the notion of purposiveness which figures in the\naesthetic context is the same as that which figures in Kant\u2019s\naccount of organisms. Guyer takes Kant to be operating with two\ndifferent senses of \u201cpurposiveness\u201d, one applying to\nartifacts (and, presumably, organisms), the other applying to objects\nof aesthetic appreciation. While purposiveness in the former sense\ncorresponds to Kant\u2019s account of purposiveness at \u00a710 in\nterms of the notion of design, the notion of purposiveness as it\napplies to beautiful objects does not involve the idea of real or\napparent design, but simply that of the satisfaction of an aim or\nobjective (1979 [1997: 190ff]; see also 1993: 417n.39).\n\nAn opposing view is defended in Ginsborg 1997b, which draws on\nKant\u2019s characterization of purposiveness as the\n\u201clawfulness of the contingent as such\u201d (FI VI, 20:217; see\nalso FI VIII, 20:228; Introduction V, 5:184; and \u00a776, 5:404) to\nargue for a univocal conception on which purposiveness is understood\nas normative lawfulness. Zuckert also lays emphasis on Kant\u2019s\nidentification of purposiveness as the \u201clawfulness of the\ncontingent\u201d (2007a: 5\u20137), but rejects Ginsborg\u2019s\nview that this in turn amounts to normative lawfulness as such (2007a:\n84n28); on her view, the lawfulness of the contingent is to be\nunderstood as \u201cthe unity of the diverse\u201d (2007a: 5) or the\n\u201cform of unity of diversity as such\u201d (2007a: 15). The\nnormative conception of purposiveness is also criticized by Teufel\n(2011), who argues that Kant held an etiological and non-teleological\nconception of purposiveness: on Teufel\u2019s view, an ascription of\npurposiveness to an object makes an ontological claim to the effect\nthat the object is the outcome of a rational, conceptually guided\nprocess. Breitenbach (2017) and Fisher (forthcoming)  agree with\nGinsborg in emphasizing Kant\u2019s characterization of purposiveness\nin terms of the lawfulness of the contingent, but without endorsing\nGinsborg\u2019s interpretation of the lawfulness as normative.\n3.2 Nature\u2019s Purposiveness for Our Cognitive Faculties\n\nKant claims in the Introductions to the Critique of Judgment\nthat it is an a priori principle of reflecting judgment that\nnature is \u201cpurposive for our cognitive faculties\u201d or\n\u201cpurposive for judgment\u201d. This principle is, in the\nterminology of the Critique of Pure Reason, regulative rather\nthan constitutive. We cannot assert that nature is, as a matter of\nobjective fact, purposive for our cognitive faculties, but it is a\ncondition of the exercise of reflecting judgment that we assume\nnature\u2019s purposiveness for our cognitive faculties. The\nassumption that nature is purposive for our cognitive faculties is\nnot, strictly speaking, part of teleology, since the purposiveness at\nissue is subjective, and teleological judgments are concerned only\nwith objective purposiveness (see, e.g., FI VII, 20:221). But it is\nnonetheless relevant to Kant\u2019s teleology, since our entitlement\nto ascribe objective purposiveness to natural things, in particular to\norganisms, derives from our more fundamental entitlement to regard\nnature as (subjectively) purposive for our cognitive faculties (FI VI,\n20:218; Introduction VIII, 5:193\u2013194).\n\nKant characterizes the principle of nature\u2019s purposiveness in a\nvariety of different ways which he seems to treat as interchangeable\neven though they do not, on the face of it, come to the same thing.\nThe variety of characterizations stems in part from the variety of\ndifferent tasks he seems to ascribe to reflecting judgment itself. In\naddition to being responsible for aesthetic judgments, and to\nsupplying the concept of purposiveness which is required for\nteleological judgments, reflecting judgment seems to be ascribed the\nfollowing cognitive tasks: the classification of natural things into a\nhierarchy of genera and species; the construction of explanatory\nscientific theories in which more specific natural laws are\nrepresented as falling under higher and more general laws; the\nrepresentation of nature as empirically lawlike\n\u00fcberhaupt; and the formation of empirical concepts\n\u00fcberhaupt. Because the principle of nature\u2019s\npurposiveness is, in effect, the principle that nature is amenable to\nthe activity of reflecting judgment itself, it seems to allow of being\nformulated in a corresponding variety of ways, that is, as a principle\nof nature\u2019s taxonomic systematicity, of its explanatory\nsystematicity, of its empirical lawlikeness, and of its empirical\nconceptualizability.\n\nKant\u2019s discussion of the principle of nature\u2019s\npurposiveness for our cognitive faculties, and his related earlier\ndiscussion (in the Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic of the\nCritique of Pure Reason) of the regulative principle of\nnature\u2019s systematicity, have, together, been seen as very\nimportant for the understanding of Kant\u2019s views on empirical\nscience. Moreover, to the extent that the principle is seen as\nrequired not only for the construction of systematic scientific\ntheories, but also for the recognition of nature\u2019s empirical\nlawlikeness or (even more fundamentally) for the possibility of any\nempirical concept-formation at all, it takes on great importance for\nan understanding of Kant\u2019s views on empirical cognition\ngenerally. However, Kant\u2019s discussion of the principle has been\nthought to pose a number of serious interpretative and philosophical\ndifficulties, including the following:\n\nHow are the various formulations of the principle related? Kant\nseems to regard them as amounting to the same, and thus to be\ncommitted to the view that if nature is empirically conceptualizable\nat all, we must also recognize the empirical regularities it manifests\nas lawlike, and the corresponding concepts and laws must fall under a\nsystematic hierarchy. But it is not clear how such a view is to be\njustified. It seems quite conceivable that natural things could be\nconceptualizable (say, under familiar concepts like dog or\ngranite) without those concepts in turn figuring in a\nsystematic hierarchy. Relatedly, it also seems conceivable that we\ncould apply such concepts to natural things without being able to\ndetect any lawlike connections among the corresponding properties, let\nalone connections which in turn allow of being incorporated into an\noverarching system of empirical laws.\nRegardless of how one understands the task of reflecting judgment,\nand the content of the corresponding principle, why is it a condition\nof the successful exercise of reflecting judgment that we assume that\nnature is suitable for reflecting judgment? Why can\u2019t we pursue\nour attempts, say, to arrive at a systematic hierarchy of natural\nconcepts and laws, without assuming in advance that nature will favour\nour efforts?\nIf the principle is indeed required, as Kant suggests it is, for\nthe empirical conceptualization of nature and for the recognition of\nnature as empirically lawlike, then it would seem to be a condition of\nthe possibility of experience. But then why is it regulative rather\nthan constitutive? Relatedly, how are we to reconcile the respective\nroles of the pure concepts of the understanding (in particular the\nconcept of causality) on the one hand, with the principle of\nnature\u2019s purposiveness for our cognitive faculties on the other?\nIf Kant has already shown, in the Analytic of the Critique of Pure\nReason, that nature is subject to causal laws, then why is there\nany need for a further principle to account for the recognition of\nnature as empirically lawlike?\n\n\nMuch of the discussion of these and related questions was stimulated\nby Buchdahl, who argues (1969a,b) that the principle of causality in\nthe Analytic of the Critique of Pure Reason is insufficient\nto account for nature\u2019s subordination to particular causal laws\nand that, in addition, a principle of systematicity is required to\naccount for nature\u2019s empirical lawlikeness. A similar view is\ndeveloped by Philip Kitcher (1986); for a somewhat revised view, see\nhis 1994. Guyer (1990b) follows McFarland (1970) in ascribing less\ncognitive significance to the principle of nature\u2019s\npurposiveness for our cognitive faculties, holding that it is required\nonly to provide us with rational motivation for attempts at\nsystematizing nature; see also Guyer (1990c, 1979 [1997: ch. 2], and\n2003c). Other influential discussions from the late 1980s and early\n1990s include Horstmann (1989), Brandt (1989), Butts (1990), Friedman\n(1992b and 1992a: ch. 5), Patricia Kitcher (1990: ch. 8; 1992), Walker\n(1990), and Brittan (1992). Friedman\u2019s view is notable in taking\na top-down approach to the systematicity of nature, on which empirical\nlaws of nature (such as the laws of chemistry) can be justified a\npriori through a top-down approach illustrated by Kant\u2019s\njustification of Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation in the\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science. Some of the\nliterature from this period, especially the views of Philip Kitcher\nand Buchdahl, is discussed in Ginsborg 2018a.\n\nA number of commentators have taken Kant\u2019s views on the\nprinciple of nature\u2019s purposiveness for our cognitive faculties\nto be fundamental for understanding Kant\u2019s views on the\npossibility of empirical knowledge. Floyd (1998) and Allison (2001:\nch. 1) claim that the principle represents Kant\u2019s answer to\nHume\u2019s problem of induction; Ginsborg (1990a: ch. 4; 1990b)\ntakes it to be a condition of empirical conceptualization and hence of\nall empirical judgment, not just of judgments based on inductive\ninference; Patricia Kitcher (1990: ch. 8; 1992) also argues for a\nclose connection between Kant\u2019s views on the systematicity of\nnature and empirical concept-formation. An even stronger view is\nsuggested by Abela (2006), who takes it to be required as a condition\nfor empirical truth, which he sees as required in turn for the\npossibility of any object-directed representation. Geiger (2009) also\nholds that the principle is required for all empirical cognition (see\nalso Geiger 2003), but argues that it is in the \u201cCritique of\nTeleological Judgment\u201d, and not in the Introductions to the\nCritique of Judgment (nor in the Appendix to the Dialectic of\nthe first Critique), that Kant offers his fullest argument\nfor its necessity. Other commentators who take the principle of\nnature\u2019s purposiveness to be a condition of empirical cognition\nin general include Teufel (2017).\n\nThe idea that the assumption of nature\u2019s purposiveness for our\ncognitive faculties is a condition of empirical concept-formation is\npotentially helpful in addressing the problem of the unity of the\nCritique of Judgment (see\n Section 1),\n given that the free play of imagination and understanding\ncharacteristic of judgments of beauty is often seen as closely related\nto the activity of imagination which allows us to categorize objects\nas having general features and falling into kinds. More generally, the\nquestion of how to relate the principle of nature\u2019s\npurposiveness for our cognitive faculties to the activity of the\ncognitive faculties in aesthetic judgment has been discussed by a\nnumber of commentators; see, for example, Ginsborg (1990b), Pippin\n(1996), Allison (2001: ch. 2), Guyer (2003b), Baz (2005), Caranti\n(2005), Hughes (2006; 2007: ch. 7), Gentry (2018) and Geiger\n(2020).\n3.3 Organisms as Natural Purposes\n\nIn \u00a7\u00a764\u201365 of the Analytic of Teleological Judgment,\nKant introduces the notion of a \u201cnatural purpose\u201d or\n\u201cnatural end\u201d [Naturzweck] and argues both that\n\u201corganized beings\u201d, that is, plants and animals,\ninstantiate the concept of a natural purpose and also that they are\nthe only beings in nature that do so (\u00a765, 376). (Kant sometimes\nsays that they are natural purposes, and sometimes only that they must\nbe \u201cregarded\u201d or \u201cconsidered\u201d as natural\npurposes.) Organized beings (or, to use the more modern term,\n\u201corganisms\u201d) are, or must be considered as, purposes\nbecause we can conceive of their possibility only on the assumption\nthat they were produced in accordance with design. They thus meet the\ndefinition of \u201cpurpose\u201d given at \u00a710. (In the terms\nintroduced in\n Section 3.1,\n they display \u201cinner objective material purposiveness\u201d.)\nBut they are, or must be considered, as products of nature rather than\nproducts of conscious design.\n\nWhat makes an organism qualify as a natural purpose is that it is\n\u201cboth cause and effect of itself\u201d (\u00a764, 371). Kant\ngives a preliminary explanation of this idea at \u00a764 by calling\nattention to three respects in which an organism, such as a tree,\nstands in a causal relation to its own existence. First, in producing\noffspring which resemble it, a tree \u201cproduces itself as far as\nits species is concerned\u201d, so that the species of the tree\nmaintains itself in existence. Second, a tree preserves itself as an\nindividual by taking in nourishment from outside and converting it\ninto the kind of organic substance of which it, itself, is made.\nThird, and most important, the various parts of a tree mutually\nmaintain one another in existence and hence maintain the whole tree in\nexistence. For example, while the leaves are produced by the tree as a\nwhole and depend on it for their growth and maintenance, they are in\nturn necessary for the growth and maintenance of the other parts of\nthe tree, for example the trunk and roots. Kant also mentions a number\nof further phenomena illustrating the way in which an organism is\n\u201ccause and effect\u201d of itself, in particular the capacity\nof certain organisms to regenerate missing parts, and more generally\nthe capacity of organisms to repair damage to themselves.\n\nKant goes into more detail about the notion of a natural purpose in\n\u00a765, where he specifies two conditions something must meet in\norder to be a natural purpose. The first, that the \u201cparts are\npossible\u2026only through their relation to the whole\u201d\n(\u00a765, 373), is a condition on something\u2019s being, not only a\nnatural purpose, but a purpose tout court. It thus applies\nnot only to living things but also to artifacts, such as watches, in\nwhich each part is there for the sake of its relation to the whole,\nand is thus in a sense there only on account of its relation to the\nwhole. The second condition, which applies only to purposes which are\nnatural, is that \u201cthe parts of the thing\u2026are reciprocally\ncause and effect of their form\u201d (ibid.). (This corresponds to\nthe third of the features to which Kant drew our attention in the\nexample of the tree at \u00a764.) This condition is not met by\nartifacts, a point which Kant illustrates by appeal to the example of\na watch, whose parts, unlike the parts of a plant or animal, do not\nproduce one another or maintain one another in existence.\n\nKant is concerned, then, to emphasize both an analogy and a disanalogy\nbetween organisms and artifacts. As in the case of artifacts, we can\nmake sense of organisms (that is, understand their structure and\nworkings) only by appeal to teleological notions. We make sense of an\norganism by coming to understand what the functions of its various\nparts are (e.g., by coming to understand that the function of the\nheart is to pump blood round the body, or that the heart is there\n\u201cin order to\u201d pump blood round the body) just as we make\nsense of an artifact such as a watch by coming to understand the\nfunctions of its parts (e.g., that a particular wheel is\nthere in order to turn the hour hand). But organisms are unlike\nartifacts in that they are not produced or maintained by an external\ncause, but instead have the self-producing and self-maintaining\ncharacter that is revealed in the kinds of vital properties\n(reproduction of young, capacity to nourish themselves, reciprocal\ndependence of parts, capacity for self-repair) which Kant illustrates\nwith the example of the tree.\n\nThe question of how the natural character of organisms can be\nreconciled with their status as purposes, and hence of the very\ncoherence of the notion of a \u201cnatural purpose\u201d, is\nindirectly addressed by Kant in the Dialectic of Teleological Judgment\nin the form of a question about how we are to reconcile the apparently\nconflicting demands of mechanistic and teleological explanation with\nregard to living things (see\n Section 3.4\n below). But it can also be raised in a more direct form. How is it\npossible to regard one and the same object both as a purpose (hence as\nsomething which has been produced as a result of conscious design),\nand as natural (hence\u2014on the face of it\u2014something which\nhas not been produced as a result of conscious design)? To say that we\nregard it only as if it were designed does not on its own\ndispose of the question, for it is not clear what it is to regard\nsomething that is not designed \u201cas if\u201d it were designed:\nif we are not ascribing to organisms the property of being artifacts,\nthen in what respect can we coherently regard them as similar to\nartifacts?\n\nGinsborg (2001) attempts to resolve the problem of coherence by appeal\nto a conception of purposiveness as normativity (see\n Section 3.1\n above), arguing that organisms can be regarded as subject to\nnormative standards without supposing that they were designed to\naccord with those standards. Alternative solutions are offered by\nKreines (2005), who agrees that the notion of a purpose has normative\ncontent but denies that organisms for Kant are in fact purposes, and\nby Beisbart (2009), who argues that the appeal to normativity is\nunnecessary for making sense of organisms as natural purposes, since\nwe can conceive of a natural object as artefact-like by conceiving of\nits parts as produced reciprocally by one another and by the whole (in\nthe way illustrated by Kant through the example of the tree at\n\u00a764). Gambarotto (2018: 14\u201322) addresses the problem by\ndenying that Kant\u2019s notion of a natural purpose is coherent;\nKant, according to Gambarotto, holds an \u201cunstable\u201d view,\nbecause he was unable to free the notion of teleology from that of\nintention.\n\nWhile much discussion of Kant\u2019s biological teleology has\nfocussed on the Dialectic of Teleological Judgment, rather than the\nAnalytic, there is an excellent discussion of the Analytic of\nTeleological Judgment in McLaughlin (1990: ch. 1), which sets\nKant\u2019s view of organisms in the context of eighteenth-century\nbiology. Huneman 2007 is a useful collection of articles which also\nset Kant\u2019s views on organisms in historical context. Other\ndiscussions of the Analytic\u2019s treatment of organisms as natural\npurposes include Zumbach (1984), Illetterati (2014), \u0160ustar\n(2014), and Goy (2014b). Fricke (1990), Guyer (2003b), and Steigerwald\n(2006) relate Kant\u2019s view of organisms as natural purposes to\nhis views about reflective judgment more generally. Breitenbach (2014)\nargues that the ascription of purposiveness to organisms is a matter\nof our regarding organic natural processes as analogous to\nreason\u2019s intentional activity. An interesting question is raised\nby the fact that Kant\u2019s conception of an organism appears to\ncome apart from the idea of a living thing, since Kant describes\n\u201clife\u201d as belonging only to beings with desires. Does\nKant, then, not count plants as living things? Nunez (2021) addresses\nthis question by suggesting that, in a sense, plants have desires even\nthough they are not conscious.\n\nGuyer (2001a) discusses the apparent threat posed by organisms to\nKant\u2019s conception of natural science as unified; a similar\nproblem is raised in Zammito (2012: 123). Breitenbach (2017) argues\nthat the threat is illusory, since the laws under which we unify\nnature include teleological principles.\n\nWhile Kant\u2019s account of organisms as natural purposes is often\ndiscussed in the context of Kant\u2019s account of natural science or\nof eighteenth-century biology, some commentators explore its\nimplications for Kant\u2019s moral teleology and views on rational\nfreedom; see for example N. Fisher (2019) and Ostaric (2021).\n3.4 Mechanism and Teleology\n\nThe same considerations which lead Kant to claim, in the Analytic,\nthat we must regard organisms as purposes, lead him to claim, in the\nDialectic, that their production cannot be mechanically explained and\nthat they must instead be accounted for in terms which ultimately make\nreference to teleology. In a well-known passage he declares that it\nis\n\n\nabsurd for human beings\u2026to hope that there may yet arise a\nNewton who could make conceivable even so much as the production of a\nblade of grass according to natural laws which no intention has\nordered. (\u00a775, 400)\n\n\nThe mechanical inexplicability of organisms leads to an apparent\nconflict, which Kant refers to as an \u201cantinomy of\njudgment\u201d, between two principles governing empirical scientific\nenquiry. On the one hand, we must seek to explain everything in nature\nin mechanical terms; on the other, some objects in nature resist\nmechanical explanation and we need to appeal to teleology in order to\nunderstand them (\u00a770, 387).\n\nThe question of how Kant resolves the Antinomy is controversial. At\nleast part of Kant\u2019s solution consists in the claim that both\nprinciples are merely \u201cregulative\u201d rather than\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d, that is, that they do not state how nature\nreally is, but only present principles which we must follow in\ninvestigating nature. Kant develops this solution in detail by arguing\nthat both the need for mechanistic explanation for nature as a whole,\nand the specific need to regard some products of nature (specifically,\norganisms) in teleological terms, are due to peculiarities of our\nhuman cognitive faculties. The core of this argument is given in\n\u00a777, where Kant differentiates two kinds of understanding, the\n\u201cdiscursive\u201d understanding of human beings, and a\ncontrasting \u201cintuitive\u201d understanding which (although Kant\ndoes not say so explicitly) might be ascribed to God. While a being\nwith a discursive understanding cannot understand how an organism\ncould come about in ways that do not involve teleological causation,\nthis does not mean this could not be understood by an intuitive\nunderstanding, and hence that the production of organisms is\nimpossible without such causation.\n\nThis argument on its own is not sufficient to address the question of\nhow the principles are to be reconciled in scientific enquiry, that\nis, how we are to seek a mechanical explanation of organisms (as\nrequired by the first principle) while still acknowledging that we\ncannot understand them except by appeal to purposes. Kant\u2019s\nostensible answer to this question is that we must\n\u201csubordinate\u201d mechanism to teleology (\u00a778, 414). Even\nin the case of organisms, we must pursue the search for mechanical\nexplanation as far as possible, yet while still recognizing the need\nfor an ultimate appeal to purposes. The subordination of mechanism to\nteleology is clarified in \u00a7\u00a780\u201381, in the\n\u201cMethodology of Teleological Judgment\u201d, where Kant\nconnects his views to some of the biological controversies of the day,\nregarding both the origin of the various species of plants and\nanimals, and the origin of individual plants and animals belonging to\nalready existing species. In the case of the origin of species, Kant\ntentatively endorses a view which allows the natural development of\nhigher species out of lower ones, but which denies the possibility\nthat the lower species in turn could develop out of unorganized matter\nas such. The view is \u201cmechanical\u201d to the extent that it\nunderstands the development of one species from another as a natural\nlaw-governed process which does not require special appeal to an\npurpose in the case of each new species; but the mechanism is\n\u201csubordinated to teleology\u201d in the sense that the\nstarting-point of the process, namely matter which itself has\norganization and life, is intelligible only by appeal to purposes\n(\u00a780). In the case of the origin of particular organisms, Kant\nendorses a view (epigenesis) on which the emergence of an apparently\nnew plant or animal is not just the expansion or unfolding of one\nwhich already existed in miniature (as on the preformationist view),\nbut a natural process whereby a new living thing comes into being. At\nthe same time, he denies that a living thing can come to be out of\nnon-living matter: the matter from which the embryo develops must\nalready be teleologically organized. The view is\n\u201cmechanical\u201d in the sense that it denies that each living\nthing was produced, like an artifact, in accordance with a specific\nintention, and allows instead that once matter is endowed with life\nand organization it has the power to produce other living things. But\nagain, as in the case of the origin of species, this\n\u201cmechanism\u201d depends on living matter, whose possibility we\ncan understand only in teleological terms.\n\nIt is difficult to understand the implications of Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of mechanism and teleology without knowing what he means by\n\u201cmechanism\u201d, and unfortunately this is very hard to\ndetermine from the text. Many commentators have taken the notion of\nmechanism to be equivalent to the notion of causality in time which\nfigures in the Critique of Pure Reason, so that the principle\nof mechanism is equivalent to the causal principle which Kant takes\nhimself to have proved in the Second Analogy. If the notion of\nmechanism is understood in this way, then Kant\u2019s solution to the\nantinomy of teleological judgment is radically at odds with his views\nin the Critique of Pure Reason, since it involves the claim\nthat the principle of mechanism is merely regulative as opposed to\nconstitutive. McLaughlin (1989, 1990), and following him Allison\n(1992), reject this reading, instead taking the notion of mechanism in\nthe relevant sense to correspond to a more specific type of causality,\nnamely the causality by which the parts of a thing determine the whole\nrather than the whole\u2019s determining the parts; this view is also\ntaken by Zanetti (1993). Ginsborg (2001) offers a third proposal, on\nwhich a thing can be explained \u201cmechanically\u201d if its\nexistence can be accounted for in terms of the intrinsic powers of the\nmatter out of which it comes to be. The topic of mechanism in the\ncontext of the Critique of Judgment is discussed further in\nBreitenbach (2008) and Geiger (2017).\n\nA related interpretative issue concerns the grounds on which organisms\nresist mechanical explanation, and hence need to be understood\nteleologically. Many commentators, including McLaughlin (1990),\nAllison (1992), and Guyer (2001a, 2003b), take organisms to be\nmechanically inexplicable in virtue of the self-maintaining and\nself-producing character which distinguishes them from artifacts (see\n Section 3.3).\n On this approach, organisms have to be explained teleologically\nbecause, in contrast to machines, their parts cannot exist\nindependently of the whole to which they belong. Against this,\nGinsborg (2004) argues that the self-maintaining character of\norganisms is irrelevant to their mechanical inexplicability in the\nrelevant sense. Kant\u2019s point in emphasizing the contrast between\norganisms and machines is not to show that organisms require\nteleological explanation (since machines such as clocks are no less in\nneed of such explanation), but on the contrary to show that, as\nnatural objects rather than artefacts, they are not to be explained in\nterms of a designer\u2019s intentions. The disagreement is discussed\nfurther in Breitenbach 2006, Watkins 2009, and McLaughlin 2014, all of\nwhich engage with the related issue of how the Antinomy is\nresolved.\n\nThere is a very helpful overview of the Antinomy of Teleological\nJudgment in chapter 4 of Quarfood 2004 which includes many references\nto relevant secondary literature. More recent discussions of the\nAntinomy include, in addition to the articles mentioned in the\nprevious paragraph, Quarfood 2006, Breitenbach 2008, Quarfood 2014,\nNuzzo 2009, Huneman 2014, and Shimony 2018: the latter three articles\ndeal specifically with Kant\u2019s distinction between discursive and\nintuitive understanding in \u00a7\u00a776\u201377.\n3.5 Nature as a System of Purposes\n\nKant is concerned with the role of teleology in our understanding not\nonly of individual organisms, but also of other natural things and\nprocesses, and of nature as a whole. Experience presents us with many\ncases in which features of a living thing\u2019s environment, both\norganic and inorganic, are beneficial or indeed necessary to it: for\nexample rivers are helpful to the growth of plants, and thus\nindirectly to human beings, because they deposit soil and thus create\nfertile land (\u00a763, 367); grass is necessary for cattle and other\nherbivorous animals, which in turn provide food for carnivores\n(\u00a763, 368). Kant makes the negative point (a version of which he\nhad earlier argued at length in the Only Possible Argument for the\nExistence of God of 1763) that we can understand these\narrangements without appeal to purposes. We can account for the origin\nof rivers mechanically, and even though grass must be regarded as an\npurpose on account of its internal organization, we do not need to\nappeal to its usefulness to other living things in order to comprehend\nit. However, he does hold that the natural objects figuring in these\nuseful arrangements have a type of purposiveness, namely outer or\nrelative purposiveness. They can be counted as purposive in this\nrelative sense as long as the thing to whose existence they contribute\nis a living thing, and hence has inner purposiveness (this condition\nis stated most clearly at \u00a782, 425).\n\nThe idea of the outer or relative purposiveness of one natural thing\nfor another, which is made possible by the idea of a natural purpose,\nin turn makes possible the idea of nature as a system of purposes,\nwhere everything in nature is teleologically connected to everything\nelse through relations of outer purposiveness. Kant puts this by\nsaying that the concept of a natural purpose \u201cnecessarily leads\nto the idea of all of nature as a system in accordance with the rule\nof purposes\u201d (\u00a767, 379), but he also puts the point more\nweakly by saying that the step from the idea of a natural purpose to\nthat of nature as a whole as a system of purposes is one which we\n\u201cmay\u201d [d\u00fcrfen] make (\u00a767, 380). This\ndoes not mean that we are entitled, still less required, to ascribe an\nintentional cause to purposive arrangements in nature, but it does\nallow us to think of them as standing not only in a mechanical, but\nalso in a teleological order. The thought of such a teleological order\nin turn leads to two further ideas: the idea of the ultimate\npurpose [letzter Zweck] of nature, which is something\nwithin nature for whose sake all other things within nature exist\n(\u00a782, 426ff), and the idea of the final purpose\n[Endzweck] of nature, which is something outside of nature\nfor whose sake nature as a whole exists (\u00a767, 378f.; \u00a784,\n434ff.). While experience does not allow us to identify either\nnature\u2019s ultimate purpose or its final purpose, Kant argues on\na priori grounds that the final purpose of nature can only be\nman considered as a moral subject, that is, considered as having the\nsupersensible ability to choose purposes freely (\u00a784, 435). To\nconsider man in this way is to conceive him as noumenon, rather than\nas part of nature. But human beings are capable of realizing their\nnoumenal freedom only in virtue of their capacity, as natural beings,\nto set themselves purposes and to use nature to fulfil them. Kant\ncalls the development of this capacity \u201cculture\u201d, and\ntakes it to require the acquisition both of specific abilities\n(\u201cculture of skill\u201d) and of the ability to make choices\nwithout being influenced by the inclinations to enjoyment stemming\nfrom our animal nature (\u201cculture of discipline\u201d). Culture\nis the ultimate purpose of nature because it prepares man for what he\nmust do in order to be the final purpose of nature (\u00a783,\n431).\n\nKant\u2019s views about the teleology of nature are discussed in\nGuyer 2001b and 2014 and Watkins 2014; the latter offers a very\nhelpful discussion of Kant\u2019s justification for the extension of\nhis views about teleology in individual organisms to nature as a\nwhole. See also A. Cohen\u2019s (2006) discussion of the relation\nbetween Kant\u2019s views on the generation of organisms and his\nconception of the final purpose of nature. N. Fisher (2019)\nunderstands human freedom as an example of the \u201cteleological\nlawgiving\u201d responsible for the purposiveness of both organisms\nindividually and nature as a whole, and uses this as the basis for an\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s argument that the final purpose of\nnature is human beings insofar as they are free.\n3.6 Teleology, Morality and Religion\n\nPart of Kant\u2019s aim in the \u201cCritique of Teleological\nJudgment\u201d is to clarify the relation of natural teleology to\nreligion, and to argue in particular against\n\u201cphysicoteleology\u201d, that is, the attempt to use natural\nteleology to prove the existence of God. (The topic of physicotheology\nwas of concern to Kant throughout his career: Kant proposes a\n\u201crevised physicotheology\u201d in the Only Possible\nArgument for the Existence of God (1763), and offers a more\nfar-reaching criticism of physicotheology in the Critique of Pure\nReason, at A620/B648ff.) Appeal to natural teleology may justify\nthe assumption of an intelligent cause of nature, but it cannot\njustify the assumption that this cause has wisdom, let alone that it\nis infinite in every respect, and in particular supremely wise\n(\u00a785, 441). For this we need to appeal, not to natural, but to\nmoral, teleology, and in particular to the idea (itself belonging not\nto natural, but to moral teleology) of man as final purpose of nature.\nThe idea of nature as purposively directed towards the existence of\nrational beings under moral laws allows us to conceive of an author of\nnature who is not merely intelligent, but also has the other\nattributes associated with the traditional idea of God, for example\nomniscience, omnipotence and wisdom (which includes omnibenificence\nand justice) (\u00a786, 444). We have to assume the existence of a\nbeing with these attributes if we ourselves are to adopt the purpose\nrequired by the moral law, a purpose which Kant calls the\n\u201chighest good\u201d and which is discussed in his moral\nwritings.\n\nAlthough natural teleology cannot prove the existence of God, it\nnonetheless has a positive role to play with respect to religion and\nmorality, in that it leads us to ask what the final purpose of nature\nis, and relatedly, to inquire into the attributes of God as author of\nnature. Thus, as Kant puts it, it \u201cdrives us to seek a\ntheology\u201d (\u00a785, 440), and thus serves as a preparation or\n\u201cpropadeutic\u201d to theology (\u00a785, 442). Kant also\nclaims that \u201cif the cognition of natural purposes is connected\nwith that of the moral purpose\u201d then \u201cit is of great\nsignificance for assisting the practical reality of the idea [of\nGod]\u201d (\u00a788, 456). The positive role of natural teleology in\nestablishing religion and morality has been emphasized by Guyer (see\nespecially 2000, 2001b, 2002a), who takes the \u201cCritique of\nTeleological Judgment\u201d to provide an important argument from\nnatural teleology to morality.\n\nA different kind of connection between Kant\u2019s natural teleology\nand his views about morality is suggested in Kain 2009, which\ninterprets Kant\u2019s biological theories as supporting his view\nthat all members of the human species (including infants and the\nseverely disabled) have moral status.\n\nThe connection between teleology and morality is often thought to be\ncentral to making sense of the Critique of Judgment as a\nunified work; see\n Section 1.\n3.7 Relevance of Kant\u2019s Natural Teleology to Contemporary Biological Theory\n\nKant\u2019s writings on natural teleology take for granted the\nbiological theories of his time, which were very different from those\nof the present day. While theorists at the time that Kant was writing\nwere prepared to consider the possibility that present-day species\nevolved out of earlier and more primitive forms of life\u2014and even\nout of mere matter as such\u2014they had no inkling of Darwin\u2019s\ntheory of natural selection, nor of Mendel\u2019s laws of\ninheritance. Moreover, it was widely assumed that living beings were\nmade of a different kind of matter from that found elsewhere in the\nuniverse; and while some biological theorists rejected this\n\u201cvitalist\u201d assumption there was, as yet, no experimental\nevidence against it. Kant himself follows Blumenbach in assuming a\ndistinctive kind of living matter which can be understood only in\nteleological terms. It might seem implausible, then, that Kant\u2019s\nviews could have any relevance to contemporary biological thought.\n\nHowever, there are reasons to think that contemporary biological\ntheory is no less committed to teleology than its eighteenth-century\ncounterpart, in particular through biologists\u2019 use of functional\nlanguage in their characterizations of the parts and behaviour of\norganisms. Kant can thus be seen as addressing a problem which is also\nof concern to present-day philosophers of biology: how to make sense\nof the idea that biological entities and processes can have purposes\nor functions without presupposing the existence of a divine designer.\nA number of interpreters have recently drawn on Kant to propose a\nsolution to the problem, although without necessarily agreeing on what\na Kantian solution amounts to. Examples of explicitly\n\u201cKantian\u201d approaches to teleology include ch. 3 of\nQuarfood 2004, Walsh 2006, A. Cohen 2007, Breitenbach 2009, and\nGinsborg 2014. McLaughlin\u2019s (2001) book on functional\nexplanation, while not explicitly proposing a Kantian approach, draws\non Kant at several points. A different suggestion regarding the\nrelevance of Kant\u2019s views to contemporary biology is offered by\nRoth (2014), who argues that Kant\u2019s anti-reductionism regarding\norganisms\u2014that they cannot be understood as composed out of\npre-existing parts\u2014offers a model for contemporary molecular\nbiology.\n\nThe view that Kant\u2019s theory is relevant to the contemporary\ndebate about biological functions is challenged forcefully in Zammito\n2006.\n",

Primary Sources</h3>\n<p>\nThe two most important sources for Kant\u2019s views on aesthetics\nand teleology, <em>Critique of Judgment</em> and \u201cFirst\nIntroduction\u201d, are both published in the standard German edition\nof Kant\u2019s works, the so-called Academy edition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Kritik der Urteilskraft</em>, <em>Kants gesammelte\nSchriften</em>, Volume 5, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1902\u2013.</li>\n<li>\u201cErste Einleitung\u201d, <em>Kants gesammelte\nSchriften</em>, Volume 20, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter,\n1902\u2013.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nPage references given in this article follow the pagination of the\nAcademy edition, which is indicated in the margins of the two most\nrecent English-language editions (see below). Unless otherwise stated,\nall references are to the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>. References to\nthe First Introduction are introduced by the abbreviation\n\u201cFI\u201d. Quotations follow the Cambridge translation (see\nbelow), with occasional divergences.</p>\n<p>\nThe two most recent English-language editions of the <em>Critique of\nJudgment</em> are to be preferred over earlier translations. The\nrecent translations are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Critique of Judgment</em>, Werner Pluhar (trans.),\nIndianapolis: Hackett, 1987.</li>\n<li><em>Critique of the Power of Judgment (The Cambridge Edition of\nthe Works of Immanuel Kant)</em>, Paul Guyer (ed.), Paul Guyer and\nEric Matthews (trans), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n2000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe earlier translations are those of J.H. Bernard (London: Macmillan,\n1892; revised edition 1914) and J.C. Meredith (Oxford: Clarendon\nPress, 1952); the edition just cited is a combination of translations\nof the two main sections of the work that were published separately in\n1911 and 1928 respectively.</p>\n<p>\nBoth the Hackett and the Cambridge editions include the First\nIntroduction, and both provide further bibliographical references (the\nHackett edition has a good bibliography of secondary literature up to\n1987). The Hackett edition is more readable, and contains explanatory\nnotes which will be useful to the less specialized reader. The\nCambridge edition contains excellent editorial notes aimed at a more\nspecialized readership, and includes copious references to other\nrelevant writings by Kant.</p>\n<p>\nThere are substantial differences among the various available\nEnglish-language editions, in particular in the translation of certain\nfrequently occurring terms, and these differences are reflected in\nvariations in the terminology used in the secondary literature. Some\nissues regarding the translation of the text are discussed in section\nIV of the Editor\u2019s Introduction to the Cambridge edition and in\nGinsborg (2002).</p>\n<p>\nTurning now to other primary sources: there is a considerable amount\nof material on aesthetics, reflecting Kant\u2019s views at various\nstages of his philosophical development, in the lectures and\nreflections on logic and anthropology. For more details on relevant\nmaterial from these texts, the reader is referred to the endnotes of\nthe Cambridge edition of the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>.\nKant\u2019s early work, <em>Observations on the Sublime and the\nBeautiful</em> (1764), has, in spite of its title, very little bearing\non Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory, and is more a work in popular\nanthropology.</p>\n<p>\nWhile Kant\u2019s most systematic and mature discussion of teleology\nis in the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>, there is also extensive\ndiscussion of the topic in the <em>Only Possible Argument for the\nExistence of God</em> (1763), included in <em>Theoretical Philosophy\n1755\u20131770</em> (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel\nKant), translated and edited by David Walford and Ralf Meerbote\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992). Kant also discusses\nteleology in two essays about race, \u201cDetermination of the\nConcept of a Human Race\u201d (1785) and \u201cOn the Use of\nTeleological Principles in Philosophy\u201d (1788); both are included\nin <em>Anthropology, History, and Education (The Cambridge Edition of\nthe Works of Immanuel Kant)</em>, edited by Gunter Z\u00f6ller and\nRobert B. Louden.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BSecoSour\">B. Secondary Sources</h3>\n<p>\nThere is a large and ever-increasing secondary literature on\nKant\u2019s aesthetics and teleology. The list of references below is\nnot intended as a comprehensive bibliography. Previous editions of\nthis entry recommended Wenzel 2009 and Henning 2009 as sources of\nfurther references in Kant\u2019s aesthetics and teleology\nrespectively; the author is not aware of comparable sources which\ncover more recent literature.</p>\n<p>\nThis article has not addressed the historical origin or reception of\nKant\u2019s views on aesthetics and teleology, so I mention here some\nreadings which might serve as points of departure for the reader\ninterested in these areas. The introduction to the Cambridge edition\nof the <em>Critique of Judgment</em> provides a useful discussion of\nthe historical sources of the work as a whole. For a more extended\naccount, see Zammito\u2019s (1992) book on the origin of the\n<em>Critique of Judgment</em>. More recent work on the historical\norigins of Kant\u2019s aesthetics more specifically includes Zuckert\n2007b and Rueger 2009, both of which emphasize Kant\u2019s relation\nto his rationalist predecessors, and Guyer 2008, which explores the\ninfluence on Kant of earlier writers on aesthetics in the empiricist\ntradition. Regarding the reception of Kant\u2019s aesthetics, Guyer\n2017b offers a brief but illuminating discussion of Kant\u2019s\nimportance to Anglo-American aesthetic theory, as illustrated by the\nprevalence of articles about Kant that have appeared in the\n<em>Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</em> since its founding in\n1941.</p>\n<p>\nMarino and Terzi 2020 discuss the reception of the Critique of\nAesthetic Judgment in the twentieth century with an emphasis on the\nContinental tradition and references to American pragmatism, with\nfigures like Hermann Cohen, Cassirer, Adorno, Arendt, Deleuze,\nDerrida, Lyotard, Eco, and Cavell.</p>\n<p>\nRegarding the historical background to Kant\u2019s views on natural\nteleology, specifically regarding the biology of his time, McLaughlin\n1990 remains an excellent guide; further work on this topic includes\nM. Fisher 2014, Goy 2014a, Zuckert 2014a. The reception of\nKant\u2019s biological work is discussed in Lenoir\u2019s\ninfluential 1980, which argues that Kant\u2019s ideas played a major\nrole in shaping German biology in the 1790s. Lenoir\u2019s view is\nchallenged in Richards 2000 and in Zammito 2012, which is also a\nuseful source of references to literature on the topic;\nZammito\u2019s (2018) study of the origin of German biology contains\na wealth of information about the history and reception of\nKant\u2019s views on biology. Huneman (2006) discusses the influence\nof Kant\u2019s views on French biology in the nineteenth century.</p>\n<p>\nThis article, and much of the literature referred to, approaches\nKant\u2019s views largely from the perspective of the analytic\ntradition in philosophy. English-language treatments of Kant\u2019s\naesthetics which accommodate more of a \u201ccontinental\u201d\nperspective include Makkreel (1990), Pillow (2000), and Gasch\u00e9\n(2002).
