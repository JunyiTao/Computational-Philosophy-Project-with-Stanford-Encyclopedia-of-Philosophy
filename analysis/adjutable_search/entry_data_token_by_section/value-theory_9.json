    "main_text": "Relation to the Deontic || Fitting Attitudes\n3.2 Fitting Attitudes\n\nIn contrast to teleological theories, which seek to account for\ndeontic categories in terms of evaluative ones, Fitting Attitudes\naccounts aspire to account for evaluative categories \u2014 like good\nsimpliciter, good for, and attributive good \u2014 in\nterms of the deontic. Whereas teleology has implications about\nvalue but is not itself a theory primarily about value, but\nrather about what is right, Fitting Attitudes accounts are\nprimarily theses about value \u2014 in accounting for it in terms of\nthe deontic, they tell us what it is for something to be good. Hence,\nthey are theories about the nature of value.\n\nThe basic idea behind all kinds of Fitting Attitudes account is that\n\u201cgood\u201d is closely linked to \u201cdesirable\u201d.\n\u201cDesireable\u201d, of course, in contrast to\n\u201cvisible\u201d and \u201caudible\u201d, which mean\n\u201cable to be seen\u201d and \u201cable to be heard\u201d, does\nnot mean \u201cable to be desired\u201d. It means, rather, something\nlike \u201ccorrectly desired\u201d or \u201cappropriately\ndesired\u201d. If being good just is being desirable, and being\ndesirable just is being correctly or appropriately desired, it follows\nthat being good just is being correctly or appropriately desired. But\ncorrect and appropriate are deontic concepts, so if\nbeing good is just being desirable, then goodness can itself be\naccounted for in terms of the deontic. And that is the basic idea\nbehind Fitting Attitudes accounts (Ewing [1947], Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f6nnow-Rasmussen [2004]).\n3.2.1 Two Fitting Attitudes Accounts\n\nDifferent Fitting Attitudes accounts, however, work by appealing to\ndifferent deontic concepts. Some of the problems facing Fitting\nAttitudes views can be exhibited by considering a couple exemplars.\nAccording to a formula from Sidgwick, for example, the good is what\nought to be desired. But this slogan is not by itself very helpful\nuntil we know more: desired by whom? By everyone? By at least someone?\nBy someone in particular? And for which of our senses of\n\u201cgood\u201d does this seek to provide an account? Is it an\naccount of good simpliciter, saying that it would be good if\n\\(p\\) just in case ____ ought to desire that \\(p\\), where\n\u201c____\u201d is filled in by whoever it is, who is supposed to\nhave the desire? Or is it an account of \u201cvalue\u201d claims,\nsaying that pleasure is good just in case pleasure ought to be desired\nby ____?\n\nThe former of these two accounts would fit in with the\n\u201cgood-first\u201d theory from section 1.1.4; the latter would\nfit in with the \u201cvalue-first\u201d theory. We observed in\nsection 1.1.4 that \u201cvalue\u201d claims don\u2019t admit of\ncomparatives in the same way that other uses of \u201cgood\u201d do;\nthis is important here because if \u201cbetter\u201d simpliciter is\nprior to \u201cgood\u201d simpliciter, then strictly speaking a\n\u201cgood-first\u201d theorist needs to offer a Fitting Attitudes\naccount of \u201cbetter\u201d, rather than of \u201cgood\u201d.\nSuch a modification of the Sidgwickian slogan might say that it would\nbe better if \\(p\\) than if \\(q\\) just in case ____ ought to desire\nthat \\(p\\) more than that \\(q\\) (or alternatively, to prefer \\(p\\) to\n\\(q\\)).\n\nIn What We Owe to Each Other, T.M. Scanlon offered an\ninfluential contemporary view with much in common with Fitting\nAttitudes accounts, which he called the Buck-Passing theory of\nvalue. According to Scanlon\u2019s slogan, \u201cto call something\nvaluable is to say that it has other properties that provide reasons\nfor behaving in certain ways with respect to it.\u201d One important\ndifference from Sidgwick\u2019s view is that it appeals to a\ndifferent deontic concept: reasons instead of ought. But\nit also aspires to be more neutral than Sidgwick\u2019s slogan on the\nspecific response that is called for. Sidgwick\u2019s slogan required\nthat it is desire that is always relevant, whereas\nScanlon\u2019s slogan leaves open that there may be different\n\u201ccertain ways\u201d of responding to different kinds of\nvalues.\n\nBut despite these differences, the Scanlonian slogan shares with the\nSidgwickian slogan the feature of being massively underspecified. For\nwhich sense of \u201cgood\u201d does it aspire to provide an\naccount? Is it really supposed to be directly an account of\n\u201cgood\u201d, or, if we respect the priority of\n\u201cbetter\u201d to \u201cgood\u201d, should we really try to\nunderstand it as, at bottom, an account of \u201cbetter than\u201d?\nAnd crucially, which are the \u201ccertain ways\u201d that are\ninvolved? It can\u2019t just be that the speaker has to have some\ncertain ways in mind, because there are some ways of responding such\nthat reasons to respond in that way are evidence that the thing in\nquestion is bad rather than that it is good \u2014 for\nexample, the attitude of dread. So does the theory require that\nthere is some particular set of certain ways, such that a thing is\ngood just in case there are reasons to respond to it in any of\nthose ways? Scanlon\u2019s initial remarks suggest rather that\nfor each sort of thing, there are different \u201ccertain ways\u201d\nsuch that when we say that that thing is good, we are saying\nthat there are reasons to respond to it in those ways. This is a\nmatter that would need to be sorted out by any worked out view.\n\nA further complication with the Scanlonian formula, is that appealing\nin the analysis to the bare existential claim that there are\nreasons to respond to something in one of these \u201ccertain\nways\u201d faces large difficulties. Suppose, for example, that there\nis some reason to respond in one of the \u201ccertain ways\u201d,\nbut there are competing, and weightier, reasons not to, so that all\nthings considered, responding in any of the \u201ccertain ways\u201d\nwould be a mistake. Plausibly, the thing under consideration should\nnot turn out to be good in such a case. So even a view like\nScanlon\u2019s, which appeals to reasons, may need, once it is more\nfully developed, to appeal to specific claims about the weight\nof those reasons.\n3.2.2 The Wrong Kind of Reason\n\nEven once these kinds of questions are sorted out, however, other\nsignificant questions remain. For example, one of the famous problems\nfacing such views is the Wrong Kind of Reasons problem (Crisp\n[2000], Rabinowicz and R\u00f6nnow-Rasmussen [2004]). The problem\narises from the observation that intuitively, some factors can affect\nwhat you ought to desire without affecting what is good. It may be\ntrue that if we make something better, then other things being equal,\nyou ought to desire it more. But we can also create incentives\nfor you to desire it, without making it any better. For example, you\nmight be offered a substantial financial reward for desiring something\nbad, or an evil demon might (credibly) threaten to kill your family\nunless you do so. If these kinds of circumstances can affect what you\nought to desire, as is at least intuitively plausible, then they will\nbe counterexamples to views based on the Sidgwickian formula.\nSimilarly, if these kinds of circumstances can give you reasons\nto desire the thing which is bad, then they will be counterexamples to\nviews based on the Scanlonian formula. It is in the context of the\nScanlonian formula that this issue has been called the \u201cWrong\nKind of Reasons\u201d problem, because if these circumstances do give\nyou reasons to desire the thing that is bad, they are reasons of the\nwrong kind to figure in a Scanlon-style account of what it is to be\ngood.\n\nThis issue has recently been the topic of much fruitful investigation,\nand investigators have drawn parallels between the kinds of reason to\ndesire that are provided by these kinds of \u201cexternal\u201d\nincentives and familiar issues about pragmatic reasons for belief and\nthe kind of reason to intend that exists in Gregory Kavka\u2019s\nToxin Puzzle (Hieronymi [2005]). Focusing on the cases of desire,\nbelief, and intention, which are all kinds of mental state, some have\nclaimed that the distinction between the \u201cright kind\u201d and\n\u201cwrong kind\u201d of reason can be drawn on the basis of the\ndistinction between \u201cobject-given\u201d reasons, which refer to\nthe object of the attitude, and \u201cstate-given\u201d reasons,\nwhich refer to the mental state itself, rather than to its object\n(Parfit [2001], Piller [2006]). But questions have also been raised\nabout whether the \u201cobject-given\u201d/\u201cstate-given\u201d\ndistinction is general enough to really explain the distinction\nbetween reasons of the right kind and reasons of the wrong kind, and\nit has even been disputed whether the distinction tracks anything at\nall.\n\nOne reason to think that the distinction may not be general enough, is\nthat situations very much like Wrong Kind of Reasons situations can\narise even where no mental states are in play. For example, games are\nsubject to norms of correctness. External incentives to cheat \u2014\nfor example, a credible threat from an evil demon that she will kill\nyour family unless you do so \u2014 can plausibly not only provide\nyou with reasons to cheat, but make it the case that you ought to. But\njust as such external incentives don\u2019t make it appropriate or\ncorrect to desire something bad, they don\u2019t make it a correct\nmove of the game to cheat (Schroeder [2010]). If this is right, and\nthe right kind/wrong kind distinction among reasons really does arise\nin a broad spectrum of cases, including ones like this one, it is not\nlikely that a distinction that only applies to reasons for mental\nstates is going to lie at the bottom of it.\n\nFurther discussion of fitting attitudes accounts of\nvalue and the wrong kind of reasons problem can be found in the entry\non\n fitting attitude theories of value.\n3.2.4 Application to the Varieties of Goodness\n\nOne significant attraction to Fitting Attitudes-style accounts, is\nthat they offer prospects of being successfully applied to attributive\ngood and good for, as well as to good simpliciter\n(Darwall [2002], R\u00f6nnow-Rasmussen [2009], Suikkanen [2009]). Just\nas reasons to prefer one state of affairs to another can underwrite\none state of affairs being better than another, reasons to choose one\ncan-opener over another can underwrite its being a better can opener\nthan the other, and reasons to prefer some state of affairs for\nsomeone\u2019s sake can underwrite its being better for that\nperson than another. For example, here is a quick sketch of what an\naccount might look like, which accepts the good-first theory from\nsection 1.1.4, holds as in section 1.1.2 that good simpliciter\nis a special case of attributive good, and understands attributive\n\u201cgood\u201d in terms of attributive \u201cbetter\u201d and\n\u201cgood for\u201d in terms of \u201cbetter for\u201d:\n\n\nAttributive better: For all kinds K, and things\nA and B, for A to be a better K\nthan B is for the set of all of the right kind of reasons to\nchoose A over B when selecting a K to be\nweightier than the set of all of the right kind of reasons to choose\nB over A when selecting a K.\n\nBetter for: For all things A, B, and\nC, A is better for C than B is\njust in case the set of all of the right kind of reasons to choose\nA over B on C\u2019s behalf is weightier\nthan the set of all of the right kind of reasons to choose B\nover A on C\u2019s behalf.\n\n\nIf being a good K is just being a better K than most (in some\ncomparison class), and \u201cit would be good if \\(p\\)\u201d just\nmeans that \\(p\\)\u2018s obtaining is a good state of affairs, and\nvalue claims like \u201cpleasure is good\u201d just mean that other\nthings being equal, it is better for there to be more pleasure, then\nthis pair of accounts has the right structure to account for the full\nrange of \u201cgood\u201d claims that we have encountered. But it\nalso shows how the various senses of \u201cgood\u201d are related,\nand allows that even attributive good and good for have, at\nbottom, a common shared structure. So the prospect of being able to\noffer such a unified story about what the various senses of\n\u201cgood\u201d have in common, though not the exclusive property\nof the Fitting Attitudes approach, is nevertheless one of its\nattractions.\n",
