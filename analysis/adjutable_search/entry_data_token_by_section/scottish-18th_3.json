    "main_text": "Hutcheson, Hume and Turnbull\n4. Hutcheson, Hume and Turnbull\n\nHutcheson influenced most of the Scottish philosophers who succeeded\nhim, perhaps all of them, whether because he helped to set their\nagenda or because they appropriated, in a form suitable to their\nneeds, certain of his doctrines. In the field of aesthetics for\nexample, where Hutcheson led, many, including Hume, Reid, and\nArchibald Alison, followed. But influences can be hard to pin down and\nthere is much dispute in particular concerning his influence on David\nHume (1711\u20131776). It is widely held that Hume\u2019s moral\nphilosophy is essentially Hutchesonian, and that Hume took a stage\nfurther Hutcheson\u2019s projects of internalisation and of grounding\nour experience of the world on sentiment or feeling. For Hume agreed\nwith Hutcheson that moral and aesthetic qualities are really\nsentiments existing in our minds, but he also argued that the\nnecessary connection between any pair of events E1 and E2 which are\nrelated as cause to effect is also in our minds, for it is nothing\nmore than a determination of the mind, due to custom or habit, to have\na belief (a kind of feeling) that an event of kind E2 will occur next\nwhen we experience an event of kind E1. Furthermore Hume argues that\nwhat we think of as the \u2018external\u2019 world is almost\nentirely a product of our own imaginative activity. As against these\nreasons for thinking Hume indebted to Hutcheson there are the awkward\nfacts that Hutcheson greatly disapproved of the draft of\nTreatise Book III that he saw in 1739 and that Hutcheson did\nhis best to prevent Hume being appointed to the moral philosophy chair\nat Edinburgh University in 1744\u20131745. In addition many of their\ncontemporaries, such as Adam Smith and Thomas Reid, held that\nHume\u2019s moral philosophy was significantly different from\nHutcheson\u2019s (Moore 1990).\n\nOne close contemporary of Hutcheson, who also stands in interesting\nrelations to Hume, is George Turnbull (1698\u20131748), regent at\nMarischal College, Aberdeen (1721\u20131727), and teacher of Thomas\nReid at Marischal. He describes Hutcheson as \u201cone whom I think\nnot inferior to any modern writer on morals in accuracy and\nperspicuity, but rather superior to almost all\u201d (Principles\nof Moral Philosophy, p. 14), and no doubt Hutcheson was an\ninfluence on Turnbull in several ways. But it has to be borne in mind\nthat the earliest of Turnbull\u2019s writings, Theses\nphilosophicae de scientiae naturalis cum philosophia morali\nconjunctione (Philosophical theses on the unity of natural\nscience and moral philosophy), a graduation oration delivered in 1723\n(Education for Life, pp. 45\u201357), shows Turnbull already\nworking on a grand project that might be thought of as roughly\nHutchesonian, but doing so several years before Hutcheson\u2019s\nearliest published work (Turnbull [EL]). As regards Turnbull\u2019s\nrelationship with Hume, we should recall that the subtitle of\nHume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature is \u201cAn attempt to\nintroduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral\nsubjects\u201d. As with Hume\u2019s Treatise, so also\nTurnbull\u2019s Principles of Moral Philosophy, published in\n1740 (the year of publication of Bk. III of the Treatise) but\nbased on lectures given in Aberdeen in the mid-1720s, contains a\ndefence of the claim that natural and moral philosophy are very\nsimilar types of enquiry. When Turnbull tells us that all enquiries\ninto fact, reality, or any part of nature must be set about, and\ncarried on in the same way, he is bearing in mind the fact, as he sees\nit to be one, that there are moral facts and a moral reality, and that\nour moral nature is part of nature and therefore to be investigated by\nthe methods appropriate to the investigation of the natural world. As\nthe natural philosopher relies on experience of the external world, so\nthe moral philosopher relies on his experience of the internal world.\nLikewise, writing in Humean terms, but uninfluenced by Hume, Turnbull\naffirms: \u201cevery Enquiry about the Constitution of the human\nMind, is as much a question of Fact or natural History, as Enquiries\nabout Objects of Sense are: It must therefore be managed and carried\non in the same way of Experiment, and in the one case as well as in\nthe other, nothing ought to be admitted as Fact, till it is clearly\nfound to be such from unexceptionable Experience and\nObservation\u201d (Education for Life, pp. 342\u20133). It\nis, in Turnbull\u2019s judgment, the failure to respect this\nexperimental method that led to the moral scepticism (as Turnbull\nthought it to be) of Hobbes and Mandeville, whose reduction of\nmorality to self-love flies in the face of experience and shocks\ncommon sense.\n\nThe experience in question is of the reality of the public affection\nin our nature, the immediate object of which is the good of others,\nand the reality of the moral sense by which we are determined to\napprove such affections. This moral sense, of whose workings we are\nall aware, is the faculty by which, without the mediation of rational\nactivity, we approve of virtuous acts and disapprove of vicious ones;\nand the approval and disapproval rise up in us without any regard for\nself-love or self-interest. In a very Hutchesonian way Turnbull\ninvites us to consider the difference we feel when faced with two acts\nwhich are the same except for the fact that one of them is performed\nfrom love of another person and the other act is performed from\nself-interest. These facts about our nature have to be accommodated\nwithin moral philosophy just as the fact that heavy bodies tend to\nfall has to be accommodated within natural philosophy.\n\nTurnbull is committed to a form of reliabilism according to which the\nfaculties that we have by the frame or constitution of our nature are\ntrustworthy. It is not simply that we are so constructed that we\ncannot but accept their deliverances; it is that we are also entitled\nto accept them. Turnbull, a deeply committed Christian, believed that\nthe author of our nature would not have so constituted us as to accept\nthe deliverances of our nature if our nature could not be relied upon\nto deliver up truth. We are in the hands of providence, and live\ndirected towards the truth for that reason. This doctrine has been\ntermed \u2018providential naturalism\u2019, and bears a marked\nresemblance to the language and also to the substance of the position\nheld by Turnbull\u2019s pupil Thomas Reid.\n",
