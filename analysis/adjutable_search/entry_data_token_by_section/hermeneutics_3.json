    "main_text": "Interpretive Experience || The Hermeneutical Circle\n1.3 The Hermeneutical Circle\n\nIn hermeneutics, by contrast, the emphasis is on the\n\u2018circularity\u2019 of understanding. This emphasis is familiar\nfrom the concept of the hermeneutical circle. Central to hermeneutics,\nthis concept is not only highly disputed but has also been developed\nin a number of distinct manners. Broadly, however, the concept of the\nhermeneutical circle signifies that, in interpretive experience, a new\nunderstanding is achieved not on the basis of already securely founded\nbeliefs. Instead, a new understanding is achieved through renewed\ninterpretive attention to further possible meanings of those\npresuppositions which, sometimes tacitly, inform the understanding\nthat we already\n have.[2]\n Philosophers have described such hermeneutically circular\npresuppositions in different ways and, since Heidegger, especially in\nterms of presuppositions of the existential and historical contexts in\nwhich we find ourselves. This contemporary significance of\nhermeneutically circular presuppositions has origins in an older (and\nperhaps more commonly known) formulation, namely, that interpretive\nexperience\u2014classically, that of text\ninterpretation\u2014involves us in a circular relation of whole and\nparts. This formulation derives from antiquity and has a place in the\napproaches of nineteenth-century figures such as Schleiermacher and\nDilthey. On the one hand, it is necessary to understand a text as a\nwhole in order properly to understand any of its parts. On the other\nhand, however, it is necessary to understand the text in each of its\nparts in order to understand it as a whole.\n\nIn contemporary hermeneutics, the concept of the hermeneutical circle\nis rarely restricted to the context of text interpretation, and, too,\nthe circularity of interpretive experience is not necessarily cast in\nterms of the relation of whole and parts. Nevertheless, as Grondin\nsuggests, this older formulation can help to illustrate the circular\ncharacter of interpretive experience (2016, 299). In text\ninterpretation so conceived, our efforts to understand a text have no\nfirm foundation from which to begin. Rather, these efforts unfold\nalways in media res, through an interpretation of the whole\nof a text that proceeds from presuppositions about the parts; and, no\nless, through an interpretation of the parts that proceeds from\npresuppositions about the whole. Understanding, then, is not pursued\n\u2018vertically\u2019 by layering beliefs on top of foundations,\nbut rather \u2018circularly,\u2019 in an interpretive movement back\nand forth through possible meanings of our presuppositions that by\nturns allow a matter to come into view. In this, the pursuit of\nunderstanding does not build \u2018higher and higher;\u2019 it goes\n\u2018deeper and deeper,\u2019 gets \u2018fuller and fuller,\u2019\nor, perhaps \u2018richer and richer.\u2019\n",
