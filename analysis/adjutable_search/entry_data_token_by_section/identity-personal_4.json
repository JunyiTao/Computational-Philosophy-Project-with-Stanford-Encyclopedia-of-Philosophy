    "main_text": "Fission\n5. Fission\n\nA more serious worry for psychological-continuity views is that you\ncould be psychologically continuous with two past or future people at\nonce. If your cerebrum\u2014the upper part of the brain largely\nresponsible for mental features\u2014were transplanted, the recipient\nwould be psychologically continuous with you by anyone\u2019s lights,\nand any psychological-continuity view will imply that she would be\nyou. If we destroyed one of your cerebral hemispheres, the resulting\nbeing would also be psychologically continuous with you.\n(Hemispherectomy\u2014even the removal of the left hemisphere, which\ncontrols speech\u2014is sometimes carried out as a treatment for\nsevere epilepsy: see Shurtleff et al. 2021.) And it would be\nthe same if we did both at once, destroying one hemisphere and\ntransplanting the other: the recipient would be you on any\npsychological-continuity view.\n\nBut now suppose that both hemispheres are transplanted, each into a\ndifferent empty head. (We needn\u2019t pretend that the hemispheres\nare exactly alike.) The two recipients\u2014call them Lefty and\nRighty\u2014will each be psychologically continuous with you. The\npsychological-continuity view as we have stated it implies that any\nbeing who is psychologically continuous with you must be you. It\nfollows that you are Lefty and also that you are Righty. But that\nagain is an impossible result: if you and Lefty are one and you and\nRighty are one, Lefty and Righty cannot be two. And yet they are:\nthere are evidently two people after the operation. One thing cannot\nbe numerically identical with two different things.\n\nPsychological-continuity theorists have proposed two different\nsolutions to this problem. One, sometimes called the\n\u201cmultiple-occupancy view\u201d, says that if there is fission\nin your future, then there are two of you, so to speak, even now. What\nwe think of as you is really two people, who are now exactly similar\nand located in the same place, doing the same things and thinking the\nsame thoughts. The surgeons merely separate them (Lewis 1976, Perry\n1972, Noonan 2019b: 141\u2013144).\n\nThe multiple-occupancy view is usually combined with the general\nmetaphysical claim that people and other persisting things are\ncomposed of temporal parts (often called\n\u201cfour-dimensionalism\u201d; see Hudson 2001, Sider 2001a, Olson\n2007: ch. 5). For each person, there is, for example, such a thing as\nher first half: an entity just like the person only briefer, like the\nfirst half of a meeting. On this account, the multiple-occupancy view\nis that Lefty and Righty coincide before the operation by sharing\ntheir pre-operative temporal parts or \u201cstages\u201d, then\ndiverge by having different temporal parts located afterwards. They\nare like two roads that coincide for a stretch and then fork, sharing\nsome of their spatial parts but not others. Much as the roads are just\nlike one road where they overlap, Lefty and Righty are just like one\nperson before the operation when they share their temporal parts. Even\nthey themselves can\u2019t tell that they are two. There are two\ncoinciding people before the operation because of what happens later,\njust as there may be coinciding two roads here because of what\u2019s\nthe case elsewhere. Whether we really are composed of temporal parts,\nhowever, is disputed. (Its consequences are explored further in\nsection 8.)\n\nThe solution more commonly proposed by psychological-continuity\ntheorists abandons the claim that psychological continuity by itself\nsuffices for us to persist, and says that a past or future being is\nyou only if she is then psychologically continuous with you and no\nother being then is. (There is no circularity in this. We need\nnot know the answer to the persistence question in order to know how\nmany people there are at any one time: that comes under the population\nquestion.) So neither Lefty nor Righty is you: they both come into\nexistence when your cerebrum is divided. If both your cerebral\nhemispheres are transplanted, you cease to exist\u2014though you\nwould survive if only one were transplanted and the other destroyed.\nFission is death. (Shoemaker 1984: 85, Parfit 1984: 207; 2012: 6f.,\nUnger 1990: 265).\n\nThis proposal, the \u201cnon-branching view\u201d, has the\nsurprising consequence that if your brain is divided, you will survive\nif only one half is preserved, but you will die if both halves are.\nThat looks like the opposite of what we should expect: if your\nsurvival depends on the functioning of your brain (because\nthat\u2019s what underlies psychological continuity), then the more\nof that organ we preserve, the greater ought to be your chance of\nsurviving.\n\nIn fact the non-branching view implies that transplanting one\nhemisphere and leaving the other in place would be fatal. Its\nconsequences are especially surprising if brain-state transfer counts\nas psychological continuity: in that case, even copying your total\nbrain state to another brain without doing you any physical harm would\nkill you.\n\nThese consequences are not only hard to believe, but mysterious as\nwell. Keeping half your brain functioning is normally sufficient for\nyour survival, according to psychological-continuity views. Why then\nwould you not survive if the other half too were kept functioning,\nseparate from the first? How could an event that would normally ensure\nyour survival destroy you if accompanied by a second such event having\nno causal effect on the first (Noonan 2019b: 128\u2013141)?\n\nThe non-branching view is largely responsible for the interest in the\nquestion of what matters in identity. Faced with the prospect of\nhaving one of your hemispheres transplanted, there is no evident\nreason to want the other one to be destroyed. Most of us, it seems,\nwould rather have both preserved, even if they go into different\nheads. Yet on the non-branching view that is to prefer death over\ncontinued existence. This leads Parfit and others to say that that is\nprecisely what we ought to prefer. We have no reason to want\nto continue existing, at least for its own sake. What you have reason\nto want (assuming that your life is going well) is that there be\nsomeone in the future who is psychologically continuous with you,\nwhether or not she is you. The usual way to achieve this is to\ncontinue existing yourself, but on the non-branching view it\u2019s\nnot necessary.\n\nLikewise, even the most selfish person may have a reason to care about\nthe welfare of the beings who would result from her undergoing\nfission, whether or not either of them would be her. The non-branching\nview suggests that the sorts of practical concerns you ordinarily have\nfor yourself can apply to someone other than you. More generally,\nfacts about numerical identity\u2014about who is who\u2014have no\npractical importance. All that matters is who is psychologically\ncontinuous with whom. Psychological-continuity views are often said to\nbe superior to brute-physical views in accounting for what matters in\nidentity. Fission cases threaten this claim. (Lewis 1976 and Parfit\n1976 debate whether the multiple-occupancy view can preserve the\nconviction that identity is what matters practically.)\n",
