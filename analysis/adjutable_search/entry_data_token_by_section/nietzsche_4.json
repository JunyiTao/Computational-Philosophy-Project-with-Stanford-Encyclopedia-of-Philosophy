One\nplausible explanation for readers\u2019 persisting sense of unclarity\nis that Nietzsche disappoints the expectation that philosophy should\noffer a reductive (or at least, highly systematized) account of the\ngood, along the lines of \u201cPleasure is the good\u201d;\n\u201cThe only thing that is truly good is the good will\u201d;\n\u201cThe best life is characterized by tranquility\u201d; or the\nlike. Nietzsche praises many different values, and in the\nmain, he does not follow the stereotypically philosophical strategy of\nderiving his evaluative judgments from one or a few foundational\nprinciples. While the resulting axiological landscape is complex, we\ncan get a sense of its shape by considering six values that play\nindisputably important roles in Nietzsche\u2019s sense of what\nmatters.\n3.2.1 Power and Life\n\nThe closest Nietzsche comes to organizing his value claims\nsystematically is his insistence on the importance of power,\nespecially if this is taken together with related ideas about\nstrength, health, and \u201clife\u201d. A well-known passage appears\nnear the opening of the late work, The Antichrist:\n\n\nWhat is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man,\nthe will to power, power itself.\n\nWhat is bad? Everything that is born of weakness.\n\nWhat is happiness? The feeling that power is growing, that\nresistance is overcome.\n\nNot contentedness but more power; not peace but war; not virtue but\nfitness (Renaissance virtue, virt\u00f9, virtue that is\nmoraline-free). (A 2)\n\n\nIn the literature, claims of this sort are associated with a\n\u201cwill to power doctrine\u201d, commonly viewed as one of\nNietzsche\u2019s central ideas (see\n section 6.1).\n That doctrine seems to include the proposal that creatures like us\n(or more broadly: all life, or even all things period) aim at the\nenhancement of their power\u2014and then further, that this fact\nentails that enhanced power is good for us (or for everything).\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century, many readers (more or less\ncasually) received this as a deeply unattractive blunt claim that\n\u201cMight makes right\u201d, which they associated with disturbing\nsocial and political tendencies salient in the era (see, e.g.,\nBeauvoir 1948: 72). After the Second World War, Walter Kaufmann\n([1950] 1974: 178\u2013333) engaged in a long-term campaign to\nrecuperate Nietzsche\u2019s thought from this unsavory line of\ninterpretations, largely by insisting on how often the forms of power\nemphasized by Nietzsche involve internally directed\nself-control and the development of cultural excellence, rather than\ndomination of others. While this account rightly highlighted internal\ncomplexity and nuance that were flattened out by the oversimplified\n\u201cmight makes right\u201d reception dominant at mid-century,\nKaufmann\u2019s approach threatens to sanitize aspects of\nNietzsche\u2019s view that were intended to pose a stark challenge to\nour moral intuitions. More sophisticated versions of this broad\napproach\u2014like Richardson\u2019s (1996) development of\nNietzsche\u2019s distinction between tyranny (in which a\ndominant drive wholly effaces what it dominates) and mastery\n(in which a more dominant drive allows some expression to the less\ndominant one but controls and redirects that expression to its own\nlarger ends)\u2014are rightly inclined to concede the troubling\naspects of Nietzsche\u2019s view (e.g., that the doctrine\ncountenances tyranny as well as mastery, even if it privileges the\nlatter).\n\nTogether with such concessions, recent work has made important\nprogress in understanding the internal complexities of\nNietzsche\u2019s position valorizing power. One of the most important\nand influential strands is Bernard Reginster\u2019s (2006:\n103\u201347; see also 2018a) emphasis on Nietzsche\u2019s conception\nof power as overcoming resistance (BGE 259, 230;\nGM I, 13; II, 16\u201317; A 2; KSA 11[111]\n13: 52\u20133; 14[173] 13: 358\u201360; 14[174] 13: 360\u20132;\n11[75] 13: 37\u20138; 9[151] 12: 424). This conception connects power\ndirectly to the person\u2019s capacity to reshape her environment in\nthe service of her ends, and it thereby provides a more intuitive\nsense of what, exactly, is supposed to be good about power. In\naddition, the interpretation locates Nietzsche\u2019s view directly\nathwart Schopenhauer\u2019s efforts to motivate pessimism by appeal\nto a ubiquitous \u201cwill to life\u201d. By replacing\nSchopenhauer\u2019s will to life with his will to power (understood\nas a drive to overcome resistance, which wills the\nworld\u2019s resistance along with its overcoming;\nKSA 9[151] 12: 424), Nietzsche can argue that our basic\ncondition as desiring, striving creatures can lead to a mode of\nexistence worthy of endorsement, rather than to inevitable frustration\n(as Schopenhauer had it). The same conception has been developed by\nPaul Katsafanas (2013), who argues that, qua agents, we are\nineluctably committed to valuing power because a Reginster-style will\nto power is a constitutive condition on acting at all. (His account\nthereby contributes to the constitutivist strategy in ethics pioneered\nby Christine Korsgaard (1996) and David Velleman (2000, 2006).). More\nrecently, Katsafanas (2015, 2019) has extended his view in a way that\nplaces the value of power at the basis of a wider account of\n\u201chigher values\u201d in Nietzsche.\n\nA second important strand of recent work emphasizes not a general,\nstructural feature of power like overcoming resistance, but a\n\u201cthicker\u201d, more substantive ethical idea. On this view,\nwhat Nietzsche values is power understood as a tendency toward growth,\nstrength, domination, or expansion (Schacht 1983: 365\u201388;\nHussain 2011). Brian Leiter (2002: 282\u20133) criticized what he\ncalled a \u201cMillian\u201d version of this idea, according to\nwhich power is valuable simply because (per the alleged\nNietzschean doctrine) power is in fact our fundamental aim. (This is\nsupposed to be analogous to Mill\u2019s strategy for deriving the\nprinciple of utility, based on the thought that we can show\nsomething\u2014viz., pleasure\u2014to be desirable by showing it to\nbe desired.) Leiter is surely right to raise worries about the Millian\nreconstruction. Nietzsche apparently takes us to be committed to a\nwide diversity of first order aims, which raises prima\nfacie doubts about the idea that for him all willing\nreally takes power as its first-order aim (as the Millian argument\nwould require). Moreover, Nietzsche\u2019s sensitivity to pessimism\nas a possible evaluative outlook creates problems for the soundness of\nthe argument form itself\u2014e.g., even supposing we must aim at\npower, maybe that is exactly what makes the world a terrible place,\nrather than providing any reason to think that power, or its pursuit,\nis valuable.\n\nBut Hussain (2011) persuasively argues that if we shift our focus away\nfrom the pursuit of power in any narrow sense to the broader (and\nquite Nietzschean) idea that growth, strength, power-expansion, and\nthe like are all manifestations of life, then at least some\nof Leiter\u2019s philosophical and most of his textual objections can\nbe avoided. On the resulting picture, Nietzsche\u2019s position reads\nas a form of ethical naturalism, arguing that expression of these\nfundamental life tendencies is good for us precisely because they\nare our basic tendencies and we are inescapably in\ntheir grip (Hussain 2011: 159, et passim). It remains unclear\nthat this view can avoid the objection rooted in the possibility of\npessimism (i.e., that the value of life/power cannot follow from its\ninescapability for us, since that might be a state to which we are\ncondemned). Given his engagement with Schopenhauer, Nietzsche\nshould have been sensitive to the worry. But Hussain (2011) shows that\na substantial strand of Nietzschean texts do fit the picture, and that\nmany other nineteenth-century philosophers who share Nietzsche\u2019s\nanti-supernaturalist commitments were attracted by such naturalist\narguments from inescapability.\n3.2.2 Affirmation\n\nA second value commitment prominent in Nietzsche\u2019s work (and\narguably related to his positive assessments of life and power) is the\nvalue of affirmation. According to Reginster (2006: 2),\n\u201cNietzsche regards the affirmation of life as his defining\nphilosophical achievement\u201d. This theme enters forcefully in Book\nIV of The Gay Science, which opens with an expression of\ndedication to \u201camor fati\u201d:\n\n\nI want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in\nthings; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful.\nAmor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to\nwage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even\nwant to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my\nonly negation. And all in all and on the whole: someday I wish to be\nonly a Yes-sayer. (GS 276)\n\n\nAfter that opening move, Nietzsche develops the idea in several more\nsections: GS 277 expresses Nietzsche\u2019s worries about a\nseductive doctrine of \u201cpersonal providence\u201d, according to\nwhich \u201ceverything that happens to us turns out for the\nbest\u201d, but such an idea could be tempting at all only because of\na far-reaching (and, Nietzsche thinks, admirable) affirmation of life,\nrooted in a talent for self-interpretation that creatively identifies\nsome description under which things really do have \u201ca profound\nsignificance and use precisely for us\u201d; a bit later,\nGS 304 (entitled, \u201cBy doing we forego\u201d)\nrecommends against any ethic demanding that we renounce this\nor that or the other, and in favor of one that demands that one\n\n\ndo something and do it again, from morning till evening\u2026 and to\nthink of nothing except doing this well, as well as\nI alone can do it;\n\n\nand then in GS 321, Nietzsche suggests that we give up on\nreproaching others directly and just focus on\n\n\nsee[ing] to it that our own influence on all that is yet to\ncome balances and outweighs his\u2026. Let our brilliance make\nthem look dark. No, let us not become darker ourselves on their\naccount, like all those who punish\u2026. Let us look away.\n\n\nFamously, the book concludes with Nietzsche\u2019s first introduction\nof his thought of eternal recurrence, which is supposed to place\n\u201cThe greatest weight\u201d on each event through its\nsuggestion that our life is good only if, upon imagining its return in\nevery detail, we can affirm it as it is (GS 341). After that\npenultimate section, Nietzsche quotes the first section of Thus\nSpoke Zarathustra, which returns repeatedly to the same theme of\naffirmation (see, e.g., Z I, 1, 5, 17, 21, 22; II, 7, 12, 20;\nIII, 3, 7, 13, 16; et passim; BGE 56; TI\nVIII, 6 and IX, 49).\n\nSome have found Nietzsche\u2019s valorization of affirmation ironic,\ngiven the polemical zeal of his negative attacks on Christianity and\ntraditional morality, but in fact, the value of affirmation meshes\nnicely with some key aspects of Nietzsche\u2019s critique. That\ncritique focuses in large measure on aspects of morality that turn the\nagent against herself\u2014or more broadly, on the side of\nChristianity that condemns earthly existence, demanding that we repent\nour earthly life as the price of admission to a different, superior\nplane of being. What is wrong with these views, according to\nNietzsche, is that they negate our life, instead of affirming it.\nBernard Reginster (2006), who has made more (and more systematic)\nsense of Nietzsche\u2019s praise of affirmation than anyone, shows\nthat the main philosophical problem it is meant to address is the\ncrisis of \u201cnihilism\u201d\u2014provoked by a process in which\n\u201cthe highest values de-value themselves\u201d (KSA\n9[35] 12: 350). Such \u201cde-valuation\u201d may rest either on\nsome corrosive argument undermining the force of all evaluative claims\nwhatsoever, or instead, on a judgment that the highest values cannot\nbe realized, so that, by reference to their standard, the world as it\nis ought not to exist. The affirmation of life can be framed as the\nrejection of nihilism, so understood. For Nietzsche, that involves a\ntwo-sided project: it should both undermine values by\nreference to which the world could not honestly be affirmed, while\nalso articulating the values exemplified by life and the world that\nmake them affirmable. (Readers interested in these issues about\nNietzschean affirmation and its compatibility (or not) with\nNietzschean critique should also consult Richardson [2020:\n353\u201397] and Huddleston [2022], which reaches a more diffident\nconclusion than this entry.)\n3.2.3 Truthfulness/Honesty\n\nIf we are to affirm our life and the world, however, we had better be\nhonest about what they are really like. Endorsing things under some\nillusory Panglossian description is not affirmation, but\nself-delusion. In that sense, Nietzsche\u2019s value of\nlife-affirmation simultaneously commits him to honesty. And arguably,\nin fact, no other virtue gets more, or more unqualified, praise in the\nNietzschean corpus: honesty is \u201cour virtue, the last\none left to us\u201d (BGE 227), and truthfulness is the\nmeasure of strength (BGE 39), or even of value as such:\n\n\nHow much truth does a spirit endure, how much truth does it\ndare? More and more that became for me the real measure of\nvalue. (EH Pref., 3)\n\n\nFour strands in Nietzsche\u2019s valuation of honesty deserve\nmention. Some texts present truthfulness as a kind of personal\ncommitment\u2014one tied to particular projects and a way of life in\nwhich Nietzsche happens to have invested. For example, in GS\n2 Nietzsche expresses bewilderment in the face of people who do not\nvalue honesty:\n\n\nI do not want to believe it although it is palpable: the great\nmajority of people lacks an intellectual conscience. \u2026 I\nmean: the great majority of people does not consider it\ncontemptible to believe this or that and live accordingly, without\nhaving first given themselves an account of the final and most certain\nreasons pro and con, and without even troubling themselves about such\nreasons afterward.\n\n\nNietzsche often recommends the pursuit of knowledge as a way of\nlife:\n\n\nNo, life has not disappointed me\u2026 ever since the day when the\ngreat liberator came to me: the idea that life could be an experiment\nfor the seeker for knowledge\u2026. (GS 324)\n\n\nIndeed, he assigns the highest cultural importance to the experiment\ntesting whether such a life can be well lived:\n\n\nA thinker is now that being in whom the impulse for truth and those\nlife-preserving errors now clash for their first fight, after the\nimpulse for truth has proved to be also a life-preserving power.\nCompared to the significance of this fight, everything else is a\nmatter of indifference: the ultimate question about the conditions of\nlife has been posed here, and we confront the first attempt to answer\nthe question by experiment. To what extent can truth endure\nincorporation? That is the question; that is the experiment.\n(GS 110)\n\n\nA second strand of texts emphasizes connections between truthfulness\nand courage, thereby valorizing honesty as the manifestation\nof an overall virtuous character marked by resoluteness,\ndetermination, and spiritual strength. BGE 39 belongs here,\nas does the passage from the EH Preface quoted above. The\nsame evaluative commitment underwrites Nietzsche\u2019s widespread\nattacks against what he calls \u201cthe Biblical \u2018proof of\nstrength\u2019\u201d\u2014a form of argument that purports to\njustify belief in some claim because that belief \u201cmakes one\nblessed\u201d or carries some emotional or practical benefit\n(GS 347; GM III, 24; TI VI, 5; A\n50\u201351; KSA 15[46] 13: 441). Such wishful thinking is\nnot only cognitively corrupt, for Nietzsche, but a troubling\nmanifestation of irresolution and cowardice.\n\nGiven Nietzsche\u2019s personal commitment to truthfulness and his\nargument that its absence amounts to cowardice, it is no surprise to\nfind him, third, attacking the alleged mendaciousness and intellectual\ncorruption of traditional religio-moral consciousness as one of the\nvery worst things about it. The dishonesty of the moralistic\n\u201cslave revolt\u201d is a constant theme (GM I, 14; see\nalso Janaway 2007: 102\u20134, and GM I, 10, 13; II, 11;\nIII, 26; TI V, 5; VI, 7; A 15, 24, 26\u20137, 36,\n38, 42, 44, 47, 48\u201353, 55\u20136), and it elicits some of\nNietzsche\u2019s most extreme and indignant rhetoric:\n\n\nOur educated people of today, our \u201cgood people\u201d, do not\ntell lies\u2014that is true; but that is not to their\ncredit. \u2026 [That] would demand of them what one may not\ndemand, that they should know how to distinguish true and false in\nthemselves. All they are capable of is a dishonest lie;\nwhoever today accounts himself a \u201cgood man\u201d is utterly\nincapable of confronting any matter except with dishonest\nmendaciousness\u2014a mendaciousness that is abysmal but\ninnocent, truehearted, blue-eyed, and virtuous. These \u201cgood\nmen\u201d\u2014they are one and all moralized to the very depths and\nruined and botched to all eternity as far as honesty is\nconcerned\u2026 (GM III, 19)\n\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that even when Nietzsche raises doubts\nabout this commitment to truthfulness, his very questions are clearly\nmotivated by the central importance of that value. The\nGenealogy\u2019s Third Treatise famously closes with the\nworry that the unconditional will to truth is a form of asceticism\n(GM III, 24). As Nietzsche observes, relentless truthfulness\ncan be corrosive for cherished values that make our lives seem worth\nliving: one cross-examination of the norm of \u201ctruth at any\nprice\u201d concludes with the exclamation,\n\n\n\u201cAt any price\u201d: how well we understand these words once we\nhave offered and slaughtered one faith after another on this altar!\n(GS 344)\n\n\nBut even in the face of such worries, Nietzsche does not simply give\nup on truthfulness. Instead, he calls for a \u201ccritique\u201d\nthat will \u201cexperimentally\u201d assess its value and legitimacy\n(GM III, 24). That experiment can be no other than the\n\u201clife of the thinker\u201d we met with already\u2014the same\n\u201cultimate question\u201d about the extent to which truthfulness\ncan \u201cendure incorporation\u201d and be made compatible with\nlife (GS 110). Again and again, in fact, Nietzsche presents\nthis question, \u201cthe question of the value of\ntruth\u201d (BGE 1), as his distinctive question,\nthe one centrally driving his philosophy (BGE 1; GM\nIII, 24, 27, GS 110, 324, 344, 346; see also BGE\n204\u201313, 227\u201330). It can carry such central significance\nonly because, in Nietzsche\u2019s eyes, the honest devotion to truth\nwas both so indispensably valuable and (potentially)\ndangerous.\n3.2.4 Art and Artistry\n\nBut if truthfulness is a core value for Nietzsche, he is nevertheless\nfamous for insisting that we also need illusion to live well.\nFrom the beginning of his career to the end, he insisted on the\nirreplaceable value of art precisely because of its power to\nensconce us in illusion. The idea was a major theme of The Birth\nof Tragedy (BT 1, 3, 4, 7, 15, 25), and although\nNietzsche later came to see the point somewhat differently, he never\ngave it up (see GS 107, also TI IX, 7\u20139). In a\nslogan, \u201cWe possess art lest we perish of the\ntruth\u201d (KSA 16[40] 13: 500).\n\nArt and artistry carry value for Nietzsche both as a straightforward\nfirst-order matter, and also as a source of higher-order lessons about\nhow to create value more generally. At the higher-order level, he\ninsists that we should learn from artists \u201chow to make things\nbeautiful, attractive, desirable for ourselves when they are\nnot\u201d (GS 299; see also GS 78). The suggestion\nis that artistic methods (\u201cMoving away from things until there\nis a good deal that one no longer sees\u2026; seeing things\u2026\nas cut out and framed\u2026; looking at them in the light of the\nsunset\u201d, and so on; GS 299) provide a kind of formal\nmodel (Landy 2012: 4, 8\u201319, et passim) for the\ndevelopment of analogous techniques that could be deployed beyond art,\nin life itself\u2014\u201cFor with them this subtle power usually\ncomes to an end when art ends and life begins, but we want to be the\npoets of our life\u201d (GS 299). But Nietzsche is just as\ninvested in the first-order evaluative point that what makes a life\nadmirable includes its aesthetic features. Famously (or notoriously),\nNietzsche argues that to \u201cattain satisfaction with\nhimself\u201d one should \u201c\u2018give style\u2019 to\none\u2019s character\u201d (GS 290). Here, it is the fact\nthat the person\u2019s character (or her life) has certain aesthetic\nproperties\u2014that it manifests an \u201cartistic plan\u201d,\nthat it has beauty or sublimity, that its moments of ugliness have\nbeen gradually removed or reworked through the formation of a second\nnature, that it exhibits a satisfying narrative (or other artistic)\nform\u2014that constitutes its value (GS 290, 299, 370;\nTI IX, 7; EH Frontispiece). Alexander Nehamas (1985)\narticulates and explores this Nietzschean theme of imposing artistic\nstructure onto one\u2019s individual life in considerable detail, and\nmany other scholars have built on his view or explored related aspects\nof the topic (see Gerhardt 1992; Young 1992; Soll 1998; Ridley 2007a,\n2007b, 2018; Anderson 2005, 2009; Anderson and Cristy, 2017;\nHuddleston 2019; and the essays in Came 2014).\n\nOne last point deserves special mention. In Nietzsche\u2019s\npresentations, the value of art and artistry often seem to stand in\nopposition to the value of truthfulness\u2014we are supposed\nto need art to save us from the truth (see Ridley 2007a,\nLandy 2002). Significantly, the opposition here is not just the one\nemphasized in The Birth of Tragedy\u2014that the substantive\ntruth about the world might be disturbing enough to demand some\nartistic salve that helps us cope. Nietzsche raises a more specific\nworry about the deleterious effects of the virtue of\nhonesty\u2014about the will to truth, rather than what\nis true\u2014and artistry is wheeled in to alleviate them, as\nwell:\n\n\nIf we had not welcomed the arts and invented this kind of cult of the\nuntrue, then the realization of general untruth and mendaciousness\nthat now comes to us through science\u2014the realization that\ndelusion and error are conditions of human knowledge and\nsensation\u2014would be utterly unbearable. Honesty would\nlead to nausea and suicide. But now there is a counterforce against\nour honesty that helps us to avoid such consequences: art as the\ngood will to appearance. (GS 107)\n\n\nNietzsche\u2019s formulation (\u201cthat delusion and error are\nconditions of human knowledge and sensation\u201d, and that this\ninsight \u201ccomes to us through science\u201d) suggests that the\nspecific error theory he has in mind is rooted in the Kantian and\nSchopenhauerian theories of cognition, perhaps as developed in more\nnaturalistic, psychologically-inflected form by later neo-Kantian and\npositivist thinkers. Those views would entail that the basic\nconditions of cognition prevent our ever knowing things as they really\nare, independently of us (see Anderson 2002, 2005; Hussain 2004; and\nthe entry on\n Friedrich Albert Lange).\n But while those are the immediate allusions, Nietzsche also endorses\nmore general ideas with similar implications\u2014e.g., skepticism\nagainst any thought (be it of the theological/metaphysical, or\nHegelian, or more modest, third Critique oriented sort) that\nthe world is purposively suited to fit the needs of our cognitive\nfaculties.\n\nWhat is more important, however, is the structure of the\nthought in GS 107. Nietzsche\u2019s idea is that\ntruthfulness itself, rigorously pursued through the\ndiscipline of science, has forced us to the conclusion that our\ncognitive powers lead us into \u201cdelusion and error\u201d, so\nthat those very demands of truthfulness cannot be satisfied. This is\nnot just one more case of the world\u2019s being inhospitable to our\nvalues, but a special instance where the cultivation of a virtue\n(honesty) itself leads to the unwelcome realization that we\ncan never live up to its genuine demands. In the face of such results,\nNietzsche suggests, the only way to escape pessimism is the\nrecognition of another, quite different value, suitable to serve as a\n\u201ccounterforce\u201d against our honesty by showing that there\ncan be something valuable about remaining content with appearances.\nThe cultural value of art in GS 107 thus rests on the\nopposition to honesty offered by the \u201cgood will to\nappearance\u201d. So it seems that the values Nietzsche endorses\nconflict with one another, and that very fact is crucial to\nthe value they have for us (Anderson 2005: 203\u201311). (See Stoll\n(2019) for a sophisticated alternative account, arguing that artistic\n\u201csemblances\u201d in Nietzsche are not supposed to be deceptive\nin any way, and therefore that the conflict between the values of\nhonesty and artistry is less stark than I have depicted it here.)\n3.2.5 Individuality, Autonomy, \u201cFreedom of Spirit\u201d\n\nFrom the earliest reception, commentators have noted the value\nNietzsche places on individuality and on the independence of the\n\u201cfree spirit\u201d from confining conventions of society,\nreligion, or morality (e.g., Simmel [1907] 1920). This strand of\nthought continues to receive strong emphasis in recent\ninterpretations\u2014see, e.g., Nehamas (1985), Thiele (1990),\nGerhardt (1992), Strong ([1975] 2000: 186\u2013217), Reginster\n(2003), Richardson (2004: 94\u2013103), Anderson (2006, 2012a),\nHiggins (2006), Schacht (2006), Acampora (2013), Meyer (2019),\nAnsell-Pearson and Bamford (2021), and the essays in Young\n(2015)\u2014and there is an impressive body of textual evidence to\nsupport it (UM III, 2, 5\u20136, 8; GS 116, 117,\n122, 143, 149, 291, 335, 338, 347, 354; BGE 29, 41, 259;\nGM I, 16, II, 1\u20133; TI IX, 41, 44, 49;\nA 11). Salient as Nietzsche\u2019s praise of individuality\nis, however, it is equally obvious that he resists any thought that\nevery single human person has value on the strength of individuality\nalone\u2014indeed, he is willing to state that point in especially\nblunt terms: \u201cSelf-interest is worth as much as the person who\nhas it: it can be worth a great deal, and it can be unworthy and\ncontemptible\u201d (TI IX, 33). Scholars have advocated\nquite different explanations of what makes a person\u2019s\nindividuality valuable in the privileged cases. Some hold that\nvaluable individuals must have certain given, natural characteristics\nthat admit no (or not much) further explanation, and that these\nfeatures make them \u201chigher men\u201d manifesting genuine value,\nwhereas others have no such value\u2014Leiter (2015) offers a\nstrongly developed naturalistic version of this approach. Other\nscholars take the \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201chigher self\u201d to\nbe a kind of ideal or norm to which a person may, or may not, live up\n(Conant 2001; see also Kaufmann [1950] 1974: 307\u201316). Still\nothers attempt to develop a position that combines aspects of both\nviews (Schacht 1983: 330\u201338), or hold that Nietzsche\u2019s\nposition on the \u201coverman\u201d or \u201chigher man\u201d is\nsimply riven by internal contradiction (M\u00fcller-Lauter [1971]\n1999: 72\u201383).\n\nA different approach takes its lead from Nietzsche\u2019s connection\nbetween individuality and freedom of spirit (GS 347;\nBGE 41\u201344). As Reginster (2003) shows, what opposes\nNietzschean freedom of spirit is fanaticism, understood as a\nvehement commitment to some faith or value-set given from without,\nwhich is motivated by a need to believe in something because\none lacks the self-determination to think for oneself (GS\n347). This appeal to self-determination suggests that we\nmight explain the value of individuality by appeal to an underlying\nvalue of autonomy: valuable individuals would be the ones who\n\u201cgive themselves laws, who create themselves\u201d (GS\n335), who exhibit self-control or self-governance (TI, V, 2;\nVIII, 6; IX, 38, 49; BGE 203), and who are thereby able to\n\u201cstand surety\u201d for their own future (GM II,\n2\u20133). A variety of scholars have recently explored the resources\nof this line of thought in Nietzsche; Anderson (2013) surveys the\nliterature, and notable contributions include Ridley (2007b, 2018),\nPippin (2009, 2010), Reginster (2012), Katsafanas (2011b, 2012, 2014,\n2016), Rutherford (2011, 2018), Anderson (2021), and especially the\npapers in Gemes and May (2009).\n3.2.6 Pluralism\n\nWe have seen that Nietzsche promotes a number of different values. In\nsome cases, these values reinforce one another. For example,\nNietzsche\u2019s emphasis on affirming life could be taken to enhance\nor to confirm the value of life itself, qua successful\nexpression of will to power, or conversely, one might trace the value\nof affirmation to its acknowledgment of our inescapable condition as\nliving, power-seeking creatures. Similarly, we saw that both the\nvirtue of honesty and the value of art and artistry play essential\nroles in support of the person\u2019s ability to affirm life\n(Anderson 2005: 203\u201311). Nietzsche appeals to the metaphor of a\ntree\u2019s growth to capture this sort of organic interconnection\namong his commitments:\n\n\nFor this alone is fitting for a philosopher. We have no right to be\nsingle in anything: we may neither err nor hit upon the truth\nsingly. Rather, with the necessity with which a tree bears its fruit\nour thoughts grow out of us, our values, our yes\u2019s and\nno\u2019s and if\u2019s and whether\u2019s\u2014the whole lot\nrelated and connected among themselves, witnesses to one will, one\nhealth, one earthly kingdom, one sun. (GM Pref., 2)\n\n\nHowever interrelated Nietzsche\u2019s values, though, they appear to\nremain irreducible to a single common value or principle that explains\nthem all. For example, the account of honesty and artistry explored in\nsections\n 3.2.3\n and\n 3.2.4\n revealed that the support they provide to the value of affirmation\ndepends on their opposition to one another, as\n\u201ccounterforces\u201d (GS 107): if this is right, then\nNietzsche\u2019s various values may interact within an organic whole,\nbut some of the interactions are oppositional, so they cannot all\narise from a monistic philosophical system.\n\nThat very fact, however, fits nicely with another of Nietzsche\u2019s\ncore values, the value of pluralism itself. For Nietzsche, a\nperson\u2019s ability to deploy and be responsive to a multiplicity\nof values, of virtues, of outlooks and \u201cperspectives\u201d, is\na positive good in its own right. Nietzsche\u2019s defense of this\nidea is perhaps clearest in the epistemic case, where he insists on\nthe value of bringing multiple perspectives to bear on any question:\nthe thinker must \u201cknow how to make precisely the\ndifference in perspectives and affective interpretations\nuseful for knowledge\u201d, because\n\n\nThere is only a perspectival seeing, only a\nperspectival \u201cknowing\u201d; and the more affects we\nallow to speak about a matter, the more eyes, different eyes,\nwe know how to bring to bear on one and the same matter, that much\nmore complete will our \u201cconcept\u201d of this matter, our\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d, be. (GM III, 12)\n\n\nAs the passage makes clear, however, Nietzschean perspectives are\nthemselves rooted in affects (and the valuations to which affects give\nrise), and in his mind, the ability to deploy a variety of\nperspectives is just as important for our practical and evaluative\nlives as it is for cognitive life. In GM I, 16, for example,\nhe wraps up a discussion of the sharp opposition between the good/bad\nand good/evil value schemes with a surprising acknowledgment that the\nbest of his contemporaries will need both, despite their\nopposition:\n\n\ntoday there is perhaps no more decisive mark of the \u201chigher\nnature\u201d, of the more spiritual nature, than to be\nconflicted in this sense and to be still a real battleground for these\nopposites. (GM I, 16; see also BGE 212; TI\nV, 3; and EH I)\n\n\nWhile efforts to provide a systematic reconstruction unifying\nNietzsche\u2019s philosophy around one fundamental thought or basic\nvalue retain their attraction for many commentators, it is fair to say\nthat all such efforts have remained controversial. Meanwhile,\nNietzschean pluralism has been a major theme of several landmark\nNietzsche studies (e.g., Nehamas 1985, Schacht 1983, Poellner 1995,\nRichardson 2004), and some of the most sophisticated recent treatments\nof his value theory have returned evaluative pluralism to the center\nof attention (Railton 2012; Huddleston 2017). Huddleston\u2019s view\nis particularly noteworthy, since he argues that Nietzsche\u2019s\nconceptions of strength and health\u2014which, as we saw, are\nconnected to the allegedly foundational value of power\u2014are\nthemselves disunified \u201ccluster concepts\u201d involving an\ninternal plurality of separate and irreducible commitments. In fact,\nNietzsche\u2019s commitment to pluralism helps us understand how his\ndiverse positive values fit together. From his pluralistic point of\nview, it is a selling point, not a drawback, that he has many other\nvalue commitments, and that they interact in complex patterns to\nsupport, inform, and sometimes to oppose or limit one another, rather\nthan being parts of a single, hierarchically ordered, systematic\naxiology.\n4. The Self and Self-fashioning\n\nA probing investigation into the psyche was a leading preoccupation\nfor Nietzsche throughout his career, and this aspect of his thought\nhas rightly been accorded central importance across a long stretch of\nthe reception, all the way from Kaufmann (1950) to recent work by\nPippin (2010), Katsafanas (2016), Leiter (2019), Riccardi (2021), and\nothers. Some of Nietzsche\u2019s own programmatic reflections\nhighlight the centrality of this enterprise: perhaps most famously, he\ncloses an extended treatment of the shortcomings of previous\nphilosophy (in Part I of Beyond Good and Evil) with a\ndemand\n\n\nthat psychology be recognized again as the queen of the sciences, for\nwhose service and preparation the other sciences exist. For psychology\nis once again on the path to the fundamental problems. (BGE\n23)\n\n\nIn\n section 2,\n we saw that Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality rests crucially on\npsychological analyses that purport to expose the self-destructive\neffects of moral attitudes like guilt and ascetic self-denial, as well\nas the corrosive mismatch between the official claims of altruistic\nmorality and its underlying motivation in ressentiment. On\nthe positive side, Nietzsche is equally keen to detail the\npsychological conditions he thinks would be healthier for both\nindividuals and cultures (see, e.g., GS Pref. and 382;\nBGE 212; TI V, 3 and VIII, 6\u20137). Thus,\nNietzsche\u2019s psychology is central to his evaluative agenda and\nto his projects as a cultural critic. Aside from its instrumental\nsupport for these other projects, Nietzsche pursues psychological\ninquiry for its own sake, and also for the sake of the self-knowledge\nthat it intrinsically involves (GM III, 9; GS Pref.,\n3 and 324; but cf. GM Pref., 1). Still, despite widespread\nappreciation of Nietzsche\u2019s psychological acumen\u2014and\ndespite the centrality of psychology to his philosophical method, core\nquestions, and evaluative aims\u2014even the most basic outlines of\nhis substantive psychology remain a matter of controversy. Debate\nbegins with the object of psychology itself, the psyche, self, or\nsoul.\n\nA significant body of Nietzschean texts express extreme skepticism\nthat there is any such thing as a \u201cself\u201d, or\n\u201csoul\u201d, as well as doubts about the traditional faculties\nof the soul and the basic capacities they were supposed to exercise\n(thinking, willing, feeling). This passage from the notebooks is\ntypical\u2014\u201cTo indulge the fable of \u2018unity,\u2019\n\u2018soul,\u2019 \u2018person,\u2019 this we have forbidden: with\nsuch hypotheses one only covers up the problem\u201d (KSA\n37[4] 11: 577)\u2014and there are many, probably hundreds, like it\n(see D 109; GS 333; BGE 12, 17, 19, 54;\nGM I, 13; TI III, 5 and VI, 3). At the same time,\nNietzsche\u2019s own psychological analyses make free appeal not only\nto the self, but even to some of the traditional faculties (e.g., the\nwill) of which he is most skeptical elsewhere: for example, the\n\u201csovereign individual\u201d of GM II, 1\u20133 is\ndistinctive for developing a \u201cmemory of the will\u201d that\nunderwrites his capacity to keep promises and \u201cvouch for himself\nas future\u201d (GM I, 13); or again, Nietzsche\u2019s\nfavored strategy of deploying a multiplicity of perspectives in\nknowledge (see\n section 3.2.6)\n assumes the existence of a cognitive self that stands back from\nparticular drives and affects, and so has \u201cthe ability to\ncontrol one\u2019s Pro and Con and dispose of them\u201d in\nsupport of the larger cognitive project (GM III, 12, see also\nBGE 284).\n\nThis apparent conflict in the texts has encouraged competing\ninterpretations, with commentators emphasizing the strands in\nNietzsche to which they have more philosophical sympathy. For example,\nstrongly naturalist interpreters like Brian Leiter (2007, 2015, 2019)\nand Matthias Risse (2007) focus on Nietzsche\u2019s skepticism about\nthe will and the pure soul to reject any Kantian-style source of\nagency that can stand apart from and direct the person\u2019s basic\ndrives or fundamental nature. Somewhat similarly, readers attracted by\na Cartesian conception of consciousness as the essence of the mental,\nbut repelled by Cartesian dualism, highlight Nietzsche\u2019s\nemphasis on the importance of the body (GM III, 16;\nZ I, 4) to suggest that his apparent claims about psychology\nshould be heard instead as a kind of physiology of drives\nthat rejects mental psychology altogether (for different\nversions, see Poellner 1995: 216\u201329, 174; Haar [1993] 1996: 90,\net passim). Riccardi (2018, 2021) argues for a more nuanced\nview, in which the conscious self runs in parallel to the more\nfundamental bodily self. Attacking unity rather than mentality, a\ngroup of readers interested in Nietzsche\u2019s agonistic conception\nof politics tends to emphasize his similarly agonistic, internally\ncontested, conception of the self (Hatab 1995, 2018; Acampora 2013).\nIn a diametrically opposed direction from those first three, Sebastian\nGardner (2009) insists that, while Nietzsche was sometimes tempted by\nskepticism about a self which can stand back from the solicitations of\ninclination and control them, his own doctrines about the creation of\nvalue and self-overcoming in fact commit him to something like a\nKantian transcendental ego, despite his protestations to the\ncontrary.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s actual psychological explanations rely heavily on\nappeals to sub-personal psychological attitudes. As Janaway (2009: 52)\nobserves, a great many different kinds of attitude enter these\naccounts (including not only the standard beliefs and desires of\ncurrent-day moral psychology, but also \u201cwills\u201d, feelings,\nsensations, moods, imaginings, memories, valuations, convictions, and\nmore), but arguably the core attitudes that do the most work for him\nare drives and affects. These attitude types have\nbeen intensively studied in recent work (see esp. Richardson 1996,\n2020; Katsafanas 2011b, 2013, 2016; Alfano 2019; Leiter 2019; and\nRiccardi 2021; see also Anderson 2012a, Clark and Dudrick 2015, Creasy\n2020). While much remains controversial, it is helpful to think of\ndrives as dispositions toward general patterns of activity; they aim\nat activity of the relevant sort (e.g., an eating drive, a drive for\npower), and they also represent some more specific object or occasion\nof the activity in a particular case (e.g., this ice cream, or\novercoming a particular problem in the course of writing a paper).\nAffects are emotional states that combine a receptive and felt\nresponsiveness to the world with a tendency toward a distinctive\npattern of reaction\u2014states like love, hate, anger, fear, joy,\netc. Typically, the sub-personal attitudes postulated in\nNietzsche\u2019s psychological explanations represent the world in\none way or another. Since he endorses Leibniz\u2019s thought that\nrepresentation, not consciousness, is the decisive mark of the mental\n(GS 354; see Simmons 2001, for discussion), it is reasonable\nto treat these attitudes as distinctively psychological, whether they\nare conscious or not.\n\nBut what about a personal-level self to serve as the owner of such\nattitudes? It seems that Nietzsche\u2019s postulated drives and\naffects could not coherently be counted as psychological (and\nsub-personal) without such a self, and yet, the skeptical\npassages canvassed above seem to rule out any such thing. This remains\na controversial problem, but it is clear at least that\nNietzsche\u2019s own proposal was to develop a radically reformed\nconception of the psyche, rather than to reject the self, or soul,\naltogether (see Riccardi 2021). BGE 12 provides some\nprovocative ideas about what such a reformed conception might involve:\nthere, Nietzsche insists that we should \u201cgive the finishing\nstroke\u201d to what he calls \u201cthe soul\natomism\u201d, which he goes on to explain as\n\n\nthe belief which regards the soul as something indestructible,\neternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon:\u2026\nBetween ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of \u201cthe\nsoul\u201d at the same time, and thus to renounce one of the most\nancient and venerable hypotheses\u2014as happens frequently to clumsy\nnaturalists who can hardly touch on \u201cthe soul\u201d without\nimmediately losing it. But the way is now open for new versions and\nrefinements of the soul hypothesis, [including] \u201cmortal\nsoul\u201d, \u201csoul as subjective multiplicity\u201d, and\n\u201csoul as social structure of the drives and\naffects\u201d\u2026 (BGE 12)\n\n\nHere Nietzsche alludes to traditional rational psychology, and its\nbasic inference from the pure unity of consciousness to the\nsimplicity of the soul, and thence to its indivisibility and\nimmortality. As he notes, these moves treat the soul as an indivisible\n(hence incorruptible) atom, or monad. Nietzsche\u2019s alternative\nproposal takes its shape from the rejection of such atomism\u2014the\nsoul as he understands it will be internally complex, rather than\nsimple, and therefore subject to disintegration. That idea informs\nNietzsche\u2019s striking slogans about the soul\u2019s\n\u201cmortality\u201d, \u201cmultiplicity\u201d, and internal\n\u201csocial structure\u201d. The \u201cdrives and affects\u201d\nare evidently supposed to serve as the constituents comprising this\nmultiplicity. Nietzsche thus construes the psyche, or self, as an\nemergent structure arising from such sub-personal constituents (when\nthose stand in the appropriate relations), thereby reversing the\ntraditional account, which treats sub-personal attitudes as mere\nmodes, or ways of being, proper to a preexisting unitary mental\nsubstance\u2014(see Anderson 2012a for an attempt to flesh out the\npicture; see also Gemes 2001; Hales and Welshon 2000: 157\u201382;\nRiccardi 2021; Anderson 2021). But however vulnerable, mortal, and\nsubject to inner division the soul is supposed to be on the reformed\nconception, it nevertheless remains (as Nietzsche\u2019s rejection of\nreductive naturalism makes clear) a genuinely psychological\nentity over and above its constituent drives and affects. Moreover,\nsince the drives and affects that constitute it are individuated\nlargely in terms of what (and how) they represent, the\npsychology needed to investigate the soul must be an interpretive, and\nnot merely and strictly a causal, form of inquiry (see Pippin 2010;\nRidley 2018).\n\nIn these respects, Nietzsche\u2019s psychology treats the self as\nsomething that has to be achieved or constructed, rather than\nas something fundamentally given as part of the basic\nmetaphysical equipment with which a person enters the world. This idea\nof the self as achieved rather than given was noticed already by\nSchacht (1983), and was elevated into a central theme in\nNehamas\u2019s (1985) influential Nietzsche interpretation. On that\nreading, the project of individual self-fashioning, or self-creation,\nis located at the heart of Nietzsche\u2019s philosophical agenda (see\nesp. GS 290, 335; TI IX, 49). Highlighting\nNietzsche\u2019s commitments to the values of artistry and\nindividuality, the interpretation claims that the main goal of\nNietzsche\u2019s new philosophers would be to construct novel,\ninteresting, and culturally resonant individual lives, whose overall\nshape they could affirm (despite whatever setbacks they involve) on\nthe strength of the (broadly) aesthetic value they instantiate. In\nNehamas\u2019s version, this agenda was closely bound up with\nNietzsche\u2019s project as a writer; he is supposed to have created\nhimself, in the relevant sense, as an authorial persona through\nwriting such distinctive books (Nehamas 1985; see esp. 233\u20134).\nWhile this suggestion, and even the very idea of self-creation, has\nremained controversial both textually and philosophically (see, e.g.,\nPippin 2010: 109\u201311), it has led to much further work\u2014some\ndirectly influenced by Nehamas (1985), some developed in partial or\nentire opposition to it\u2014yielding real insights about the nature\nof Nietzschean selfhood, and the relations among the key ideas of\nself-creation, the creation of value, individuality, and Nietzschean\nfreedom (see, e.g., Gerhardt 1992; Nehamas 1998: 128\u201356; Leiter\n1998; May 1999: 107\u201326; Anderson and Landy 2001; Reginster 2003;\nAnderson 2005, 2009, 2012a. 2021; Ridley 2007a, 2007b, 2018; Gardner\n2009; Gemes 2009a, 2019; Pippin 2009, 2010; Poellner 2009; Richardson\n2009, 2020; Acampora 2013; Katsafanas 2016: 164\u201396,\n220\u201356; Anderson and Cristy 2017; Rutherford 2018).\n\nOne especially sustained alternative to Nehamas (1985) is developed by\nElijah Millgram (2007, 2020, 2023). He argues that, so far from using his\nauthorship to fashion a unified character for himself, Nietzsche was\n(on the contrary) a disunified, or even disintegrating,\nagent. On Millgram\u2019s construal, Nietzsche\u2019s books develop\na strategy for constructing a meaningful life that is suitable for\npeople of that sort. This represents an interesting kind of limit case\nfor the project of self-fashioning, which mounts a sustained critique\nagainst the widespread assumption in modern philosophy that unity of\nagency is always desirable or valuable.\n5. Difficulties of Nietzsche\u2019s Philosophical Writing\n\nFor all the novelty of Nietzsche\u2019s doctrines and the apparent\nextremity of his criticisms of traditional morality, religion, and\nphilosophy, perhaps nothing about his work seems more out of step with\nthe ordinary procedures of philosophy than the way he writes. The\npoint is sufficiently obvious that it has by now become an entirely\nconventional trope to begin commentaries with remarks about the\nunconventional character of Nietzsche\u2019s style. Despite\nthe attention it gets, however, we continue to lack anything like a\ncomprehensive account of Nietzsche\u2019s strategies as a writer and\nrhetorician. Most of us (this entry included) are defeated by the\nbewildering richness of the subject matter and content ourselves with\na few observations of special relevance to our other purposes. Perhaps\nAlexander Nehamas (1985: 13\u201341) comes closest to meeting the\nexplanatory challenge by highlighting the key underlying fact that\ndefeats our interpretive efforts\u2014the seemingly endless variety\nof stylistic effects that Nietzsche deploys. In doing so, he follows\nthe lead of Nietzsche\u2019s own retrospective assessment from\nEcce Homo: \u201cI have many stylistic\npossibilities\u2014the most multifarious art of style that has ever\nbeen at the disposal of one man\u201d (EH III, 4). This\nentry will focus on a few points useful for readers making their early\napproaches to Nietzsche\u2019s texts.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s most obvious departure from conventional\nphilosophical writing is the basic plan and construction of his books.\nMost philosophers write treatises or scholarly articles, governed by a\ncarefully articulated thesis for which they present a sustained\nargument. Nietzsche\u2019s books are nothing like that. Many are\ndivided into short, numbered sections, which only sometimes have\nobvious connections to nearby sections. While the sections within a\npart are often thematically related (see, e.g., GS Book II or\nBGE Parts I, V, VI), even then they do not typically fit\ntogether into a single overall argument. Nietzsche himself notes the\nbriskness with which he treats his concerns, insisting that \u201cI\napproach deep problems like cold baths: quickly into them and quickly\nout again\u201d (GS 381). To the natural complaint that such\ntelegraphic treatment courts misunderstanding, he replies that\n\n\nOne does not only wish to be understood when one writes; one wishes\njust as surely not to be understood. \u2026 [Some authors]\ndid not wish to be understood by \u201cjust anybody\u201d.\n(GS 381)\n\n\nSome of Nietzsche\u2019s books (notably The Birth of\nTragedy, the Genealogy, and the Antichrist)\noffer greater continuity of argumentation, but even there, he will\noften take advantage of section breaks to drop one thread of reasoning\nand move on to apparently unrelated points, leaving the reader to\npiece together how the various aspects of his case are supposed to fit\ntogether (GM II is a notoriously challenging case in point;\nsee Reginster 2018b, 2021). Thus Spoke Zarathustra is unified\nby following the career of a central character, but the unity is loose\nand picaresque-like\u2014a sequence of episodes which arrives at a\nsomewhat equivocal (or at a minimum, at a controversial)\nconclusion that imposes only weak narrative unity on the whole.\n\nThis mode of writing is often classified as \u201caphoristic\u201d,\nand Nietzsche is rightly granted an honored place within the\ndistinguished lineage of that form in German philosophy, which goes\nback at least to Georg Lichtenberg\u2019s Waste Books.\nLichtenberg wrote his fragments for himself rather than the public,\nbut the strategies he developed nevertheless made a serious impact.\nHis aphorisms revealed how the form could be extended from its\nessentially pedagogical origins (providing compressed, memorable form\nfor some principle or observation) into a sustained, exploratory mode\nof reasoning with oneself. Schopenhauer was a particular admirer, and\nhis pursuit of the form (especially in Parerga and\nParalipomena) clearly influenced Nietzsche\u2019s use of the\ntechnique to frame his psychological observations\u2014(the French\nmoralistes were also an important influence; see Pippin\n2010).\n\nSome of Nietzsche\u2019s efforts consist in straightforward\npsychological analysis, like this\u2014\u201cEgoism is the law of\nperspective applied to feelings: what is closest appears large and\nweighty, and as one moves further away size and weight decrease\u201d\n(GS 162)\u2014while others encapsulate a point Nietzsche has\nbeen developing through the section (see, e.g., \u201cWe are always\nonly in our own company\u201d; GS 166). More distinctively,\nhowever, many Nietzschean aphorisms rely on a \u201ctwist\u201d\neffect\u2014the first part sets up a certain expectation, which is\nthen controverted or deepened by a thought-provoking reversal in the\nsecond part. Occasionally, these aphorisms are even set up as\nmini-dialogues:\n\n\nA: \u201cOne is praised only by one\u2019s peers.\u201d\n\nB: \u201cYes, and whoever praises you says: I am your peer\u201d.\n(GS 190)\n\n\nMany aphorisms exhibiting this sort of \u201ctwist\u201d trade on\nthe type of cynicism typical in moralistes like La\nRochefoucauld, but however much he learned from the French, Nietzsche\nbrought larger ambitions to the form; he is equally willing to leave\ncynicism behind and deploy the twist form simply to provoke active\nreflection in the reader, as he does here: \u201cEvery habit lends\nour hand more wit but makes our wit less handy\u201d (GS\n247). Kaufmann ([1950] 1974: 72\u201395) famously suggested that\nNietzsche coined his aphorisms in the service of an\n\u201cexperimentalist\u201d mode of philosophizing, and there is\nsomething to the idea. But the reader should take care, for not every\nNietzschean aphorism is an experiment, and not every short section is\nan aphorism. Indeed, many multi-sentence sections build up to\nan aphorism, which enters only as a proper part included within the\nsection, perhaps serving as its culmination or a kind of summative\nconclusion (rather than an experiment).\n\nA particularly important case in point is the \u201caphorism placed\nbefore this [Third] treatise\u201d of the Genealogy, which\nNietzsche\u2019s Preface (GM Pref., 8) offers to the reader\nas an especially good example of the densely summative power of the\nform\u2014the entire Third Treatise is supposed to be just an\ninterpretation of that aphorism. Maudemarie Clark (1997), John Wilcox\n(1997), and Christopher Janaway (1997) showed convincingly that the\naphorism in question appears in section 1 of the Third Treatise, and\nis not the Treatise\u2019s epigram. But the first section itself is\nnot simply one long aphorism. Instead, the aphorism that requires so\nmuch interpretation is the compressed, high-impact arrival point of\nGM III, 1; the section begins by noting a series of different\nthings that the ascetic ideal has meant, listed one after another and\nserving as a kind of outline for the Treatise, before culminating in\nthe taut aphorism:\n\n\nThat the ascetic ideal has meant so much to man, however, is\nan expression of the basic fact of the human will, its horror\nvacui: it needs a goal,\u2014and it would rather will\nnothingness than not will. (GM III, 1)\n\n\n(It is to this compressed formulation, not the entirety of the\nsection, that Nietzsche returns when he wraps up his interpretation in\nGM III, 28.)\n\nNietzsche\u2019s proclivity for aphorisms is responsible for some of\nthe difficulty of his writing; these formulations stand out from their\nbackground context, making it harder to integrate Nietzsche\u2019s\ndiscourse from one section to the next. But the aphoristic form is\nonly one challenge among many. As has been widely noted (by every\nreader, I suppose, but see Blondel [1971] 1977; Derrida 1978; de Man\n1979; Kofman [1983] 1993; Nehamas 1985; Higgins 1987, 2000; Thomas\n1999), Nietzsche\u2019s writing is full of figures of speech and\nliterary tropes, and decoding these modes of indirection demands\nactive engagement and subtlety from the reader. Indeed, some of\nNietzsche\u2019s most favored and widespread figures (e.g.,\nhyperbole, litotes, irony) involve purposely saying something more, or\nless, or other than one means, and so forcing the reader to adjust.\nWhat is more, Nietzsche makes heavy use of allusions to both\ncontemporary and historical writing, and without that context one is\nvery likely to miss his meaning\u2014BGE 11\u201315 offers\na particularly dense set of examples; see Clark and Dudrick (2012:\n87\u2013112) for one reading to which Hussain (2004), Anderson\n(2002), and Riccardi (2011) propose alternatives. Almost as often,\nNietzsche invents a persona so as to work out some view that he will\ngo on to qualify or reject (BGE 2 is a clear example), so it\ncan be a steep challenge just to keep track of the various voices in\naction within the text.\n\nNehamas (1988: 46\u201351) offers perhaps the best description of the\ncomplexities of the resulting reading experience: our attention is\nfixated by certain brilliant, striking passages, or even whole\nsections, but because their connections to nearby sections are not\nspecified, and because the text seems to switch from one voice to\nanother, the reader simply moves on, taking each new section on its\nown terms; in short order, one forgets the details, the points, the\ncautions, or even the subject matter of passages several sections\nback\u2014except, perhaps, for a few, especially memorable\nhighlights, which we then call \u201caphorisms\u201d. In this way,\nit is all too easy to fail to read Nietzsche\u2019s books as\nbooks at all. Nevertheless, such comprehensive readings are there\nto be had. Clark and Dudrick (2012) offer a a sustained, albeit\ncontroversial, close reading exploring the unity of Part I of\nBeyond Good and Evil; their efforts reveal the scope of the\ndifficulty\u2014they needed an entire book to explain the allusions\nand connections involved in just twenty-three sections of Nietzsche,\ncovering some couple-dozen pages! Attacking the same problem in a\ndifferent spirit, Nehamas (1988) calls attention to the loose,\n\u201ctrain of thought\u201d-type connections that connect one\nsection to another through large swaths of works like Beyond Good\nand Evil or The Gay Science. Following such connections,\nhe proposes, allows us to understand the books as monologues\npresented by a narrator. For Nehamas, the creation of such a narrative\npersona is central to Nietzsche\u2019s larger project of authorial\nself-fashioning. By contrast, Millgram (2023) counter-proposes that\nNietzsche deploys different \u201cvoices\u201d, different\nnarrators, in his different books (see also Millgram 2007, 2020); and\nrelated papers available in the Other Internet Resources). On this\nless unified picture, the sort of \u201cpersona-inhabiting\u201d\neffect noted above for the obvious case of BGE 2 is a much\nmore widespread and destabilizing feature of Nietzsche\u2019s\nwriting. It becomes a precondition for adequately understanding each\nparticular book that we first work out in what voice Nietzsche means\nto be speaking\u2014and what attitude he, and we, are supposed to\nhave toward that character\u2014before we can assess the work\u2019s\nfirst-order claims and effects.\n\nWhile Millgram\u2019s view is extreme in the demands it takes\nNietzsche\u2019s writing to place on the reader, demands of the broad\nsort he indicates\u2014a demand, for example, to hear\nNietzsche\u2019s interventions in the right tone, or\n\u201cspirit\u201d, if they are to be understood\u2014do\nseem to be imposed by some rather straightforward features of the\ntexts. Consider, for instance, what the point could be of that most\nobvious feature of Nietzsche\u2019s rhetoric\u2014the heat and\nvitriol with which his condemnations of traditional values are\npresented. The Genealogy of Morality advertises itself as\n\u201ca Polemic\u201d, but even in that genre, it is an outlier for\nrhetorical intensity; Nietzsche passes up no opportunity for\nemotionally charged attacks, he repeatedly blasphemes what is held\nmost sacred in the culture, he freely deploys offensive anti-Semitic\ntropes (turned back, ironically, against anti-Semitic Christians\nthemselves), he fairly shouts, he sneers between scare quotes, he\nrepeatedly charges bad faith and dishonesty on the part of his\nopponents, and on and on. It is impossible to conclude that the work\nis not deliberately designed to be as offensive as possible\nto any earnest Christian believer. Why? Given Nietzsche\u2019s\nexpressed conviction that many Christians ought to remain ensconced\nwithin their ideology because it is the best they can do for\nthemselves (that \u201cthe sense [Sinn] of the herd should\nrule in the herd\u201d; KSA 7[6], 12: 280), perhaps the\nright way to understand this much rhetorical overkill is that it\noperates as a strategy for audience partition. In\nNietzsche\u2019s mind, those who cannot do without Christianity and\nits morality would only be harmed by understanding how destructive and\nself-defeating it is; Nietzsche wants to explain those terrible\neffects, but he also wants to protect Christianity-dependent readers\nfrom harm. He achieves both at once by ensuring that exactly those\nreaders will be so offended by his tone that their anger will impair\nunderstanding and they will fail to follow his argument. If this is\nright, the very vitriol of the Genealogy arises from an aim\nto be heard only by the right audience\u2014the one it can\npotentially aid rather than harm\u2014thereby overcoming the problem\nthat\n\n\nThere are books that have opposite values for soul and health,\ndepending on whether the lower soul\u2026 or the higher and more\nvigorous ones turn to them. (BGE 30; compare BGE\n26\u20137, 40 and GS 381)\n\n\nThat such an interpretation of Nietzsche\u2019s intentions is even\npossible shows how great a challenge these explosive, carefully\ncrafted texts pose to their readers.\n6. Key Doctrines\n\nThis entry has focused on broad themes pursued throughout\nNietzsche\u2019s writing, but most philosophically sophisticated\ncommentary on his work has been devoted to the explication of certain\ncore doctrinal commitments, which Nietzsche seems to rely upon\nthroughout, but which he does not develop systematically in his\npublished works in the way typical for philosophers. Some of these\ndoctrines, like the idea of the eternal recurrence of the same, are\ndescribed as \u201cfundamental\u201d by Nietzsche himself\n(EH III, Z, 1), but are formulated in surprisingly\ncryptic or metaphorical ways\u2014and discussed, or even mentioned at\nall, much more rarely than one would expect given the importance\nNietzsche placed on them. Others are alluded to more frequently, but\nraise theoretical questions that would normally call for careful\nphilosophical development that is largely absent in Nietzsche\u2019s\nbooks. Commentators have therefore expended considerable effort\nworking out rational reconstructions of these doctrines. This section\noffers brief explanations of three of the most important: the will to\npower, the eternal recurrence, and perspectivism.\n6.1 The Will to Power\n\nThe will to power doctrine seems to claim that everything that exists\nrests fundamentally on an underlying basis of\n\u201cpower-centers\u201d, whose activity and interactions are\nexplained by a principle that they pursue the expansion of their\npower. But it is far from obvious what these\n\u201cpower-centers\u201d are supposed to be, and much scholarly\ncontroversy concerns what kind of doctrine Nietzsche intended to\nadvance in the first place. Some readers take it as Nietzsche\u2019s\nversion of a foundational metaphysics (see Heidegger 1961, Jaspers\n[1936] 1965, and for a sophisticated recent approach in the same broad\nvein, Richardson 1996; see also alternative accounts by Doyle 2019 and\nRemhof 2017). Others receive it as an anti-essentialist rejection of\ntraditional metaphysical theorizing in which abstract and shifting\npower-centers replace stable entities (Nehamas 1985: 74\u2013105,\nPoellner 1995: 137\u201398), or else as a psychological hypothesis\n(Kaufmann [1950] 1974, Soll 2015; Clark and Dudrick 2015), or a\n(quasi-)scientific conjecture (Schacht 1983; Abel 1984; Anderson 1994,\n2012b). Opposing all such readings of the will to power as a doctrine\nin theoretical philosophy, Maudemarie Clark (2000, see also 1990:\n205\u201344) reads the will to power as a strand of thought that\nmakes no claim about the world, but instead expresses\nNietzsche\u2019s values. As we saw (3.B.i.), the idea that the\nexpansion of power is good does have a better claim than other\nprinciples to systematize Nietzsche\u2019s various value commitments,\nand different evaluative interpretations have been developed by\nReginster (2006), Katsafanas (2013), Hussain (2011), and Richardson\n(2020: 53\u201380). But there are also a large number of other texts\nsuggesting that Nietzsche\u2019s main agenda was to argue that the\npsychological world\u2014or the world as a whole\u2014is\nfundamentally composed of centers of power exerting force against one\nanother (see GS 13; BGE 23, 36, 259; GM II,\n16\u201317; III, 13\u201315; as well as many passages from the\nnotebooks). Nietzsche\u2019s description of such \u201cpower\ncenters\u201d is sometimes fairly abstract, evoking mathematically\ncharacterized \u201cforce-centers\u201d like those sometimes\npostulated in nineteenth century physics, but at other times, concrete\npsychological or biological entities (people, drives, organisms) are\nthe things exerting will to power.\n\nReginster\u2019s (2006, 2018a) account of the will to power as a\ndrive toward overcoming resistance can marshal a large body of textual\nsupport (particularly from the notebooks), and it also has some\nparticular philosophical advantages. From a dialectical point of view,\nReginster\u2019s reading substantially clarifies the target and the\nphilosophical point of Nietzsche\u2019s views about power: they are\naimed against Schopenhauer\u2019s ideas about the will to life and\nhis use of those ideas to motivate pessimism. The will to power\nthereby contributes directly to Nietzsche\u2019s program of\ncombatting nihilism (in its guise as the evaluative claim that the\nworld ought not to exist). Reginster\u2019s reading also makes good\nsense of the apparent centrality of the will to power in\nNietzsche\u2019s psychology. In the same passage where he claims that\npsychology should \u201cbe recognized again as the queen of the\nsciences\u201d, Nietzsche proposes to understand psychology \u201cas\nthe morphology and development-theory of the will to\npower\u201d (BGE 23). Some commentators take this to\nsuggest a monistic psychology in which all drives whatsoever aim at\npower, and so count as manifestations of a single underlying drive (or\ndrive-type). That interpretation makes a poor fit for the prodigious\ndiversity of Nietzsche\u2019s actual psychological explanations (and\nfor his pluralist leanings), but Reginster\u2019s view redirects\nattention away from drives\u2019 first-order aims toward a general\nstructural feature of drives\u2014their tendency to overcome\nresistance in the course of pursuing whatever first-order activities\nthey pursue. (It thereby builds on a productive earlier line of\nthought from Richardson (1996), according to which the drives\u2019\nwilling power is not a matter of their taking power as a first-order\naim, but concerns the manner of their pursuit of various\nfirst-order aims.) The Reginster account thereby permits the will to\npower to retain an important centrality within Nietzsche\u2019s\npsychology, without needing to claim that no one (or no drive) ever\naims at anything else besides power.\n\nOther scholars have emphasized Nietzsche\u2019s speculations that\nbiological and physical phenomena could be explained by a postulated\nsystem of interacting power centers (Abel 1984; M\u00fcller-Lauter\n1999a; Moore 2002; Gemes 2013). Abel (1984) offers a particularly\nsystematic and carefully argued version of the approach, which\nhighlights important resonances between Nietzsche\u2019s ideas and\nelements of Leibniz\u2019s dynamical physics and metaphysics, whereas\nMoore (2002) pursues a fascinating line of connections between\nNietzsche\u2019s thoughts about power and certain physiological ideas\nadvanced by Wilhelm Roux (1881). Moore\u2019s reading emphasizes the\nbiologized rhetoric Nietzsche often uses in his talk about power\n(together with its connections to health and sickness, degeneration,\netc.) as part of a case that the will to power idea locates\nNietzsche\u2019s philosophy within a wider intellectual trend toward\n\u201cbiologism\u201d prevalent at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury.\n6.2 Perspectivism\n\nMuch of Nietzsche\u2019s reaction to the philosophy of his\npredecessors is mediated through his interest in the notion of\nperspective. He thought that past philosophers had largely ignored the\ninfluence of their own perspectives on their work, and had therefore\nfailed to control those perspectival effects (BGE 6; see\nBGE I more generally). Commentators have been both fascinated\nand perplexed by what has come to be called Nietzsche\u2019s\n\u201cperspectivism\u201d, and it has been a major concern in a\nnumber of large-scale Nietzsche commentaries (see, e.g., Danto 1965;\nKaulbach 1980, 1990; Schacht 1983; Abel 1984; Nehamas 1985; Clark\n1990; Poellner 1995; Richardson 1996; Benne 2005). There has been as\nmuch contestation over exactly what doctrine or group of commitments\nbelong under that heading as about their philosophical merits, but a\nfew points are relatively uncontroversial and can provide a useful way\ninto this strand of Nietzsche\u2019s thinking.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s appeals to the notion of perspective (or,\nequivalently in his usage, to an \u201coptics\u201d of knowledge)\nhave a positive, as well as a critical side. Nietzsche frequently\ncriticizes \u201cdogmatic\u201d philosophers for ignoring the\nperspectival limitations on their theorizing, but as we saw, he\nsimultaneously holds that the operation of perspective makes a\npositive contribution to our cognitive endeavors. Speaking of (what he\ntakes to be) the perversely counterintuitive doctrines of some past\nphilosophers, he writes,\n\n\nParticularly as knowers, let us not be ungrateful toward such resolute\nreversals of the familiar perspectives and valuations with which the\nspirit has raged against itself all too long\u2026 : to see\ndifferently in this way for once, to want to see differently,\nis no small discipline and preparation of the intellect for its future\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d\u2014the latter understood not as\n\u201cdisinterested contemplation\u201d (which is a non-concept and\nabsurdity), but rather as the capacity to have one\u2019s Pro and\nContra in one\u2019s power, and to shift them in and out, so\nthat one knows how to make precisely the difference in\nperspectives and affective interpretations useful for knowledge.\n(GM III, 12)\n\n\nThis famous passage bluntly rejects the idea, dominant in philosophy\nat least since Plato, that knowledge essentially involves a form of\nobjectivity that penetrates behind all subjective appearances to\nreveal the way things really are, independently of any point of view\nwhatsoever. Instead, the proposal is to approach\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d (in a revised conception) asymptotically, by\nexploiting the difference between one perspective and another, using\neach to overcome the limitations of others, without assuming that\nanything like a \u201cview from nowhere\u201d is so much as\npossible. There is of course an implicit criticism of the traditional\npicture of a-perspectival objectivity here, but there is equally a\npositive set of recommendations about how to pursue knowledge as a\nfinite, limited cognitive agent.\n\nIn working out his perspective optics of cognition, Nietzsche built on\ncontemporary developments in the theory of\ncognition\u2014particularly the work of non-orthodox neo-Kantians\nlike Friedrich Lange and positivists like Ernst Mach, who proposed\nnaturalized, psychologically-based versions of the broad type of\ntheory of cognition initially developed by Kant and Schopenhauer (see\nClark 1990; Kaulbach 1980, 1990; Anderson 1998, 2002, 2005; Green\n2002; Hill 2003; Hussain 2004). The Kantian thought was that certain\nvery basic structural features of the world we know (space, time,\ncausal relations, etc.) were artifacts of our subjective cognitive\nfaculties rather than properties or relations of things in themselves;\nbut where Kant and Schopenhauer had treated these structures as\nnecessary, a priori conditions of any possible experience whatsoever,\nthe more naturalistically oriented figures who influenced Nietzsche\nsought to trace them to sources in human empirical psychology, which\nwould of course be contingent. The potential of these ineliminable\nsubject-side influences to vary suggests the idea of treating\nthem as a kind of perspective, which Nietzsche found\ndeveloped in an idealist version by Gustav Teichm\u00fcller (1882).\nLeaving Teichm\u00fcller\u2019s idealism to one side, Nietzsche\ndevelops the idea by tying cognitively important perspectives back to\nhis own psychology. In particular, the Genealogy passage\nemphasizes that for him, perspectives are always rooted in\naffects and their associated patterns of valuation. For that\nreason, Nietzsche holds that \u201cevery great philosophy so\nfar\u201d has been \u201cthe personal confession of its author and a\nkind of involuntary and unconscious memoir\u201d (BGE 6).\nThus, theoretical claims not only need to be analyzed from the point\nof view of truth, but can also be diagnosed as symptoms and\nthereby traced back to the complex configurations of drive and affect\nfrom the point of view of which they make sense. Nietzsche\u2019s\nperspectivism thus connects to his \u201cgenealogical\u201d program\nof criticizing philosophical theories by exposing the psychological\nneeds they satisfy; perspectivism serves both to motivate the program,\nand to provide it with methodological guidance.\n\nBut Nietzsche\u2019s perspectivism and his arguments for it go beyond\nepistemology, or the \u201ctheory of cognition\u201d\n(Erkenntnistheorie), as it was practiced in the broadly\nKantian milieu of his contemporary philosophy. (One should say, they\n\u201cgo beyond\u201d the theory of cognition at least;\nGemes (2009c, 2013) argues that epistemological interpretations of\nperspectivism are altogether mistaken, and that it should be taken\ninstead as fundamentally a doctrine within moral psychology, about the\ndrives and affects.) Nietzsche makes perspectivist claims not only\nconcerning the side of the cognitive subject, but also about the side\nof the truth, or reality, we aim to know. His views on this topic have\nbeen highly controversial, with some scholars emphasizing\nNietzsche\u2019s apparent denials of truth (either skeptical denials\nthat any truth is ever knowable, or more radical claims that the very\nidea of truth is somehow incoherent), and others highlighting his own\nfrequent and routine claims for the truth of his own views, as well as\nthe valorization of truthfulness and honesty we saw above (3.B.iv.). A\nnumber of different strategies have been proposed for reconciling the\ntensions between these different strands of text, including the\nsupposition that at least some of Nietzsche\u2019s own claims must\nfall outside the scope of his denials of truth (Hales and Welshon\n2000), the idea that Nietzsche distinguished different senses of\n\u201ctruth\u201d (Schacht 1983; Anderson 1998, 2005), and the\ndevelopmental proposal that Nietzsche eventually gave up on his\ndenials of truth late in his career (Clark 1990, 1998). (See recent\nexchanges on this topic between Clark (2018) and Nehamas (2015, 2017,\n2018).) In addition to work focused on Nietzsche\u2019s understanding\nof truth per se, a good deal of scholarly effort has explored\nthe way Nietzsche attempts to build his perspectivism down into the\nontology of the world by understanding reality itself as a system of\never-shifting force-centers which themselves constitute a variety of\npoints of view on the whole (notable contributions include Deleuze\n[1962] 1983; Abel 1984; Poellner 1995; Richardson 1996;\nM\u00fcller-Lauter 1999a; Hales and Welshon 2000; Gemes 2013). These\nefforts argue for strong connections between perspectivism and the\nwill to power doctrine\n (section 6.1).\n6.3 The Eternal Recurrence of the Same\n\nNietzsche himself suggests that the eternal recurrence was his most\nimportant thought, but that has not made it any easier for\ncommentators to understand. Nietzsche\u2019s articulations of the\ndoctrine all involve hypothesizing\u2014(or inducing the reader to\nimagine, or depicting a character considering)\u2014the idea that all\nevents in the world repeat themselves in the same sequence through an\neternal series of cycles. But the texts are difficult to interpret.\nAll Nietzsche\u2019s official presentations of the thought in\npublished work are either presented in hypothetical terms (GS\n341), or extremely elliptical and allusive (e.g., GS 109), or\nhighly metaphorical and quasi-hermetic (Z III, 2, 13), or all\nthree together. Most allusions to the idea, in fact, assume that one\nalready knows what it means\u2014even the claims in Ecce\nHomo that it is the \u201cfundamental conception\u201d or\n\u201cbasic idea\u201d of Zarathustra have this character.\nIn the early reception, most readers took Nietzsche to be offering a\ncosmological hypothesis about the structure of time or of fate (see\nSimmel [1907] 1920; Heidegger 1961; L\u00f6with [1935] 1997; Jaspers\n[1936] 1965), and various problems have been posed for the thesis, so\nunderstood (Simmel [1907] 1920: 250\u20131n; Soll 1973; Anderson\n2005: 217 n28). Many later commentators have focused instead on the\nexistential or practical significance of the thought (Magnus 1978;\nNehamas 1980, 1985), or its \u201cmythological\u201d import (Hatab\n2005).\n\nIn the aftermath of Nehamas (1985), an influential line of readings\nhas argued that the thought to which Nietzsche attributed such\n\u201cfundamental\u201d significance was never a cosmological or\ntheoretical claim at all\u2014whether about time, or fate, or the\nworld, or the self\u2014but instead a practical thought\nexperiment designed to test whether one\u2019s life has been\ngood. The broad idea is that one imagines the endless return\nof life, and one\u2019s emotional reaction to the prospect reveals\nsomething about how valuable one\u2019s life has been, much as\n(quoting Maudemarie Clark\u2019s memorable analogy) a spouse\u2019s\nquestion about whether one would marry again evokes\u2014and indeed,\nfairly demands\u2014an assessment of the state of the marriage (see\nClark 1990: 245\u201386; Wicks 1993; Ridley 1997; Williams 2001;\nReginster 2006: 201\u201327; Anderson 2005, 2009; Risse 2009;\nHuddleston 2022). Naturally, the threat of emerging\nscholarly consensus around this line of interpretation has prompted\npushback, and Paul Loeb (2006, 2013, 2021) has recently offered\nvigorous defense of a cosmological interpretation of Nietzsche\u2019s\nidea, building on earlier work by Alistair Moles (1989, 1990).\n\nSkeptics like Loeb are correct to insist that, if recurrence is to be\nunderstood as a practical thought experiment, commentators owe us an\naccount of how the particular features of the relevant thoughts are\nsupposed to make any difference (Soll 1973 already posed a stark form\nof this challenge). Three features seem especially salient: we are\nsupposed to imagine 1) that the past recurs, so that what has\nhappened in the past will be re-experienced in the future; 2) that\nwhat recurs is the same in every detail; and 3) that the\nrecurrence happens not just once more, or even many times more, but\neternally. The supposed recurrence (1) plausibly\nmatters as a device for overcoming the natural bias toward the future\nin practical reasoning. Since we cannot change the past but think of\nourselves as still able to do something about the future, our\npractical attention is understandably future directed. But if the\nquestion is about the value of our life overall, events in\nthe past matter just as much as those in the future, and disregarding\nthem is a mistake, at best, and a case of motivated reasoning or\ndishonesty, if we are exploiting future-bias to ignore aspects of\nourselves we would rather not own up to (General form: \u201cWhew! At\nleast I\u2019ll never have to go through that\nagain\u2026\u201d). By imaginatively locating our entire life once\nagain in the future, the thought experiment can mobilize the resources\nof our practical self-concern to direct an evaluative judgment onto\nour life as a whole. Similar considerations motivate the constraint of\nsameness (2). If my assessment of myself simply\nelided any events or features of my self, life, or world with\nwhich I was discontent, it would hardly count as an honest, thorough\nself-examination. The constraint that the life I imagine to recur must\nbe the same in every detail is designed to block any such\nelisions.\n\nAs Reginster (2006: 222\u20137) observes, it is more difficult to\nexplain the role of the third constraint, eternity. It is\nnevertheless clear that it does make a practical difference: to put a\nsharp point on it, return to Clark\u2019s marriage analogy; one might\nwell be very happy to live one\u2019s marriage again (once, or twice,\nor even several times), but still prefer some variation in spousal\narrangements over the course of eternity\u2014indeed, Milan Kundera\n(1991) seems to be putting his character Agnes in something like that\nsituation in his use of the Nietzschean thought experiment early on in\nImmortality. Reginster proposes that the eternity constraint\nis meant to reinforce the idea that the thought experiment calls for\nan especially wholehearted form of\naffirmation\u2014joy\u2014whose strength is measured by the\ninvolvement of a wish that our essentially finite lives could be\neternal. More modestly, one might think that Nietzsche considered it\nimportant to rule out as insufficient a particular kind of\nconditional affirmation, suggested by the Christian\neschatological context, which would leave in place the judgment that\nearthly human life carries intrinsically negative value. After all,\nthe devout Christian might affirm her earthly life as a test of\nfaith, which is to be redeemed by an eternal heavenly reward\nshould one pass that test\u2014all the while retaining her commitment\nthat, considered by itself, earthly life is a sinful condition to be\nrejected. Imagining that my finite life recurs eternally\nblocks this avenue (and returns the focus of assessment to the finite\nfeatures of real life) by supposing that there will never be a point\nat which one could pretend that finite life is once and for all\n\u201cover and done with\u201d (Anderson 2005: 198, 203; 2009:\n237\u20138).",
