    "main_text": "Dirac and the Foundations of Quantum Theory || The Rigged Hilbert Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics\n3.2 The Rigged Hilbert Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics\n\nMathematicians worked very hard to provide a rigorous foundation for\nDirac\u2019s formal framework. One key element was Schwartz\u2019s\n(1945; 1950\u20131951) theory of distributions. Another key element,\nthe notion of a nuclear space, was developed by Grothendieck (1955).\nThis notion made possible the generalized-eigenvector decomposition\ntheorem for self-adjoint operators in rigged Hilbert space \u2013 for\nthe theorem see Gelfand and Vilenken (1964, pp. 119\u2013127), and\nfor a brief historical account of the convoluted path leading to it\nsee Berezanskii (1968, pp. 756\u2013760). The decomposition principle\nprovides a rigorous way to handle observables such as position and\nmomentum in the manner in which they are presented in Dirac\u2019s\nformal framework. These mathematical developments culminated in the\nearly 1960s with Gelfand and Vilenkin\u2019s characterization of a\nstructure that they referred to as a rigged Hilbert space\n(Gelfand and Vilenkin 1964, pp. 103\u2013127). It is unfortunate that\ntheir chosen name for this mathematical structure is doubly\nmisleading. First, there is a natural inclination to regard it as\ndenoting a type of Hilbert space, one that is rigged in some\nsense, but this inclination must be resisted. Second, the term\nrigged has an unfortunate connotation of illegitimacy, as in\nthe terms rigged election or rigged roulette table,\nand this connotation must be dismissed as prejudicial. There is\nnothing illegitimate about a rigged Hilbert space from the standpoint\nof mathematical rigor (or any other relevant standpoint). A more\nappropriate analogy may be drawn using the notion of a rigged ship:\nthe term rigged in this context means fully equipped. But\nthis analogy has its limitations since a rigged ship is a fully\nequipped ship, but (as the first point indicates) a rigged Hilbert\nspace is not a Hilbert space, though it is generated from a Hilbert\nspace in the manner now to be described.\n\nA rigged Hilbert space is a dual pair of spaces \\((\\Phi , \\Phi^x)\\)\nthat can generated from a separable Hilbert space \\(\\Eta\\) using a\nsequence of norms (or semi-norms); the sequence of norms is generated\nusing a nuclear operator (a good approximate meaning is an operator of\ntrace-class, meaning that the trace of the modulus of the operator is\nfinite). In the mathematical theory of topological vector spaces, the\nspace \\(\\Phi\\) is characterized in technical terms as a nuclear\nFr\u00e9chet space. To say that \\(\\Phi\\) is a\nFr\u00e9chet space means that it is a complete metric\nspace, and to say that it is nuclear means that it is the\nprojective limit of a sequence of Hilbert spaces in which the\nassociated topologies get rapidly finer with increasing n (i.e., the\nconvergence conditions are increasingly strict); the term\nnuclear is used because the Hilbert-space topologies are\ngenerated using a nuclear operator. In distribution theory, the space\n\\(\\Phi\\) is characterized as a test-function space, where a\ntest-function is thought of as a very well-behaved function (being\ncontinuous, n-times differentiable, having a bounded domain or at\nleast dropping off exponentially beyond some finite range, etc).\n\\(\\Phi^x\\) is a space of distributions, and it is the topological dual\nof \\(\\Phi\\), meaning that it corresponds to the complete space of\ncontinuous linear functionals on \\(\\Phi\\). It is also the inductive\nlimit of a sequence of Hilbert spaces in which the topologies get\nrapidly coarser with increasing n. Because the elements of \\(\\Phi\\)\nare so well-behaved, \\(\\Phi^x\\) may contain elements that are not so\nwell-behaved, some being singular or improper functions (such as\nDirac\u2019s \\(\\delta\\) function). \\(\\Phi\\) is the topological\nanti-dual of \\(\\Phi^x\\), meaning that it is the complete set of\ncontinuous anti-linear functionals on \\(\\Phi^x\\); it is anti-linear\nrather than linear because multiplication by a scalar is defined in\nterms of the scalar\u2019s complex conjugate.\n\nIt is worth noting that neither \\(\\Phi\\) nor \\(\\Phi^x\\) is a Hilbert\nspace in that each lacks an inner product that induces a metric with\nrespect to which the space is complete, though for each space there is\na topology with respect to which the space is complete. Nevertheless,\neach of them is closely related to the Hilbert space \\(\\Eta\\) from\nwhich they are generated: \\(\\Phi\\) is densely embedded in \\(\\Eta\\),\nwhich in turn is densely embedded in \\(\\Phi^x\\). Two other points are\nworth noting. First, dual pairs of this sort can also be generated\nfrom a pre-Hilbert space, which is a space that has all the features\nof a Hilbert space except that it is not complete, and doing so has\nthe distinct advantage of avoiding the partitioning of functions into\nequivalence classes (in the case of functions spaces). The term\nrigged Hilbert space is typically used broadly to include\ndual pairs generated from either a Hilbert space or a pre-Hilbert\nspace. Second, the term Gelfand triplet is sometimes used\ninstead of the term rigged Hilbert space, though it refers to\nthe ordered set \\((\\Phi , \\Eta , \\Phi^x)\\), where \\(\\Eta\\) is the\nHilbert space used to generate \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\Phi^x\\).\n\nThe dual pair \\((\\Phi , \\Phi^x)\\) possesses the means to represent\nimportant operators for quantum mechanics that are problematic in a\nseparable Hilbert space, particularly the unbounded operators that\ncorrespond to the observables position and momentum, and it does so in\na particularly effective and unproblematic manner. As already noted,\nthese operators have no eigenvalues or eigenvectors in a separable\nHilbert space; moreover, they are only defined on a dense subset of\nthe elements of the space and this leads to domain problems. These\nundesirable features also motivated von Neumann to seek an alternative\nto the separable Hilbert space framework for quantum mechanics, as\nnoted above. In a rigged Hilbert space, the\noperators\u00a0corresponding to position and momentum can have a\ncomplete set of eigenfunctionals (i.e., generalized eigenfunctions).\nThe key result is known as the nuclear spectral theorem (and it is\nalso known as the Gelfand-Maurin theorem). One version of the theorem\nsays that if A is a symmetric linear operator defined on the space\n\\(\\Phi\\) and it admits a self-adjoint extension to the Hilbert space\nH, then A possesses a complete system of eigenfunctionals belonging to\nthe dual space \\(\\Phi^x\\) (Gelfand and Shilov 1977, chapter 4). That\nis to say, provided that the stated condition is satisfied, A can be\nextended by duality to \\(\\Phi^x\\), its extension \\(A^x\\) is continuous\non \\(\\Phi^x\\) (in the operator topology in \\(\\Phi^x)\\), and \\(A^x\\)\nsatisfies a completeness relation (meaning that it can be decomposed\nin terms of its eigenfunctionals and their associated eigenvalues).\nThe duality formula for extending \\(A\\) to \\(\\Phi^x\\)\nis \\(\\braket{\\phi}{A^x\\kappa} = \\braket{A\\phi}{\\kappa}\\), for all\n\\(\\phi \\in \\Phi\\) and for all \\(\\kappa \\in \\Phi^x\\). The completeness\nrelation says that for all \\(\\phi ,\\theta \\in \\Phi\\): \n\n\\[ \\braket{A\\phi}{\\theta} = \\int_{v(A)} \\lambda \\braket{\\phi}{\\lambda} \\braket{\\lambda}{\\theta}^* \\mathrm{d}\\mu(\\lambda), \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(v(A)\\) is the set of all generalized eigenvalues of \\(A^x\\)\n(i.e., the set of all scalars \\(\\lambda\\) for which there is \\(\\lambda\n\\in \\Phi^x\\) such that \\(\\braket{\\phi}{A^x\\lambda} = \\lambda\n\\braket{\\phi}{\\lambda}\\) for all \\(\\phi \\in \\Phi)\\).\n\nThe rigged Hilbert space representation of these observables is about\nas close as one can get to Dirac\u2019s elegant and extremely useful\nformal representation with the added feature of being placed within a\nmathematically rigorous framework. It should be noted, however, that\nthere is a sense in which it is a proper generalization of\nDirac\u2019s framework. The rigging (based on the choice of a nuclear\noperator that determines the test function space) can result in\ndifferent sets of generalized eigenvalues being associated with an\noperator. For example, the set of (generalized) eigenvalues for the\nmomentum operator (in one dimension) corresponds to the real line, if\nthe space of test functions is the set \\(S\\) of\ninfinitely differentiable functions of \\(x\\) which\ntogether with all derivatives vanish faster than any inverse power of\n\\(x\\) as \\(x\\) goes to infinity, whereas\nits associated set of eigenvalues is the complex plane, if the space\nof test functions is the set \\(D\\) of infinitely\ndifferentiable functions with compact support (i.e., vanishing outside\nof a bounded region of the real line). If complex eigenvalues are not\ndesired, then \\(S\\) would be a more appropriate choice\nthan \\(D\\) \u2013 see Nagel (1989) for a brief\ndiscussion. But there are situations in which it is desirable for an\noperator to have complex eigenvalues. This is so, for example, when a\nsystem exhibits resonance scattering (a type of decay phenomenon), in\nwhich case one would like the Hamiltonian to have complex eigenvalues\n\u2013 see B\u00f6hm & Gadella (1989). (Of course, it is\nimpossible for a self-adjoint operator to have complex eigenvalues in\na Hilbert space.)\n\nSoon after the development of the theory of rigged Hilbert spaces by\nGelfand and his associates, the theory was used to develop a new\nformulation of quantum mechanics. This was done independently by\nB\u00f6hm (1966) and Roberts (1966). It was later demonstrated that\nthe rigged Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics can handle a\nbroader range of phenomena than the separable Hilbert space\nformulation. That broader range includes scattering resonances and\ndecay phenomena (B\u00f6hm and Gadella 1989), as already noted.\nB\u00f6hm (1997) later extended this range to include a quantum\nmechanical characterization of the arrow of time. The Prigogine school\ndeveloped an alternative characterization of the arrow of time using\nthe rigged Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics (Antoniou\nand Prigogine 1993). Kronz (1998, 2000) used this formulation to\ncharacterize quantum chaos in open quantum systems. Castagnino and\nGadella (2003) used it to characterize\n decoherence\n in closed quantum systems.\n4 Mathematical Rigor: Two Paths\n",
