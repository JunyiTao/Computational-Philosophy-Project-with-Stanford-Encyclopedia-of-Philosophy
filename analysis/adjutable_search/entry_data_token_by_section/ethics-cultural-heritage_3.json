    "main_text": "What is Cultural Heritage? || Cultural Heritage vs. National Heritage\n1.3 Cultural Heritage vs. National Heritage\n\nIt is important to note a distinction between cultural heritage and\nnational heritage. As the discussions of official heritage and\ndifficult heritage reveal, heritage can play an influential role in\ncultivating a sense of national identity around a national culture\n(Ireland & Schofield 2015: 2; Weiss 2007). However, it is\nimportant not to conflate the idea of a national culture with the\nempirically false claim that nations are culturally homogeneous:\nindeed, the intranational diversity of cultures is the fact from which\nthe political problem of multiculturalism arises (see entry on\n multiculturalism).\n There is of course significant cultural diversity in cultural\ngroupings of many kinds, nationalistic or not. This topic is discussed\nfurther in\n section 2.2.\n",
