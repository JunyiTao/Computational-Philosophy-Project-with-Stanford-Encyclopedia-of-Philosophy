    "main_text": "The Refutation of Idealism\n2. The Refutation of Idealism\n\nIn the transcendental argument of the Refutation of Idealism,\nKant\u2019s target is not Humean skepticism about the applicability\nof a priori concepts, but rather Cartesian skepticism about\nthe external world. This argument was added by Kant to the second\nedition of the Critique of Pure Reason (B274\u2013279, with\na change suggested in the Preface to B, Bxxxix\u2013Bxli), and\nsubsequently embellished and reworked in a series of Reflections\n(Guyer 1987: 279\u2013316). More specifically, Kant intends to refute\nwhat he calls problematic idealism, according to which the existence\nof objects outside us in space is \u201cdoubtful and\nindemonstrable\u201d (B274). His strategy is to derive the claim that\nsuch objects exist from my awareness that my representations have a\nspecific temporal order. At the present time I am aware of the\nspecific temporal order of many of my past experiences, an awareness\nproduced by memory. But what is it about what I remember that allows\nme to determine the temporal order of my experiences? There must be\nsomething by reference to which I can correlate the remembered\nexperiences that allows me to determine their temporal order. But\nfirst, I have no conscious states that can play this role. Further,\nthis reference cannot be time itself, for \u201ctime by itself is not\nperceived;\u201d Kant argues for this claim in the First Analogy\n(B224\u20135). As Guyer puts it, it is not as if the content of\nmemories of individual events are manifestly indexed to specific\ntimes, as sportscasts and videotapes often are (Guyer 1987: 244). Kant\ncontends that the only other candidate for this reference is something\noutside of me in space, and it must be something (relatively)\npermanent (cf. First Analogy, B224\u20135). Perhaps this claim is\nmade plausible by how we often actually determine the times at which\nour experiences occur. We use observations of sun\u2019s positions,\nor of a clock that indicates time by way of the period of a pendulum,\nor by the period of the vibration of a cesium atom. Kant\u2019s\nargument can be seen as exploiting this fact, together with the\nobservation that there is no similar periodic process in human\nconscious experience considered independently of any spatial objects\nit might represent, and that we lack any awareness of time by itself,\nto show we must perceive objects outside us in space by reference to\nwhich we can determine the temporal order of our past experiences.\n\nGeorge Dicker provides a compelling initial representation of\nKant\u2019s argument (Dicker 2004, 2008):\n\nI am conscious of my own existence in time; that is, I am aware,\nand can be aware, that I have experiences that occur in a specific\ntemporal order. (premise)\nI can be aware of having experiences that occur in a specific\ntemporal order only if I perceive something permanent by reference to\nwhich I can determine their temporal order. (premise)\nNo conscious state of my own can serve as the permanent entity by\nreference to which I can determine the temporal order of my\nexperiences. (premise)\nTime itself cannot serve as this permanent entity by reference to\nwhich I can determine the temporal order of my experiences.\n(premise)\nIf (2), (3), and (4), are true, then I can be aware of having\nexperiences that occur in a specific temporal order only if I perceive\npersisting objects in space outside me by reference to which I can\ndetermine the temporal order of my experiences. (premise)\nTherefore, I perceive persisting objects in space outside me by\nreference to which I can determine the temporal order of my\nexperiences. (1\u20135)\n\n\nSeveral points of interpretation should be noted. First, it is\ngenerally agreed that the notion of awareness in Premise (1) should be\ninterpreted as a success notion, i.e., that to be aware that I have\nexperiences that occur in a specific temporal order is to correctly\ndetermine that they occur in this order (Allison 1983: 290ff, Guyer\n1987: 293ff, Dicker 2004, 195ff., 2008; Chignell 2010). Second, most\ncommentators concur that the experiences at issue are my past\nexperiences. Guyer suggests that the argument might be extended to\ncombinations of my past and my present experience, but Dicker objects\nthat the fact that past experiences occurred before the present one is\ndirectly knowable by introspection, and so doesn\u2019t require the\nexternal reference (Guyer 1987; Dicker 2004: 195ff.). Third, Jonathan\nBennett points out that we have single memories whose content spans an\nappreciable length of time that allow us to determine the order of\npast mental states . When one remembers hearing a certain word, one\ncan accurately determine by the content of a single memory that\ncertain phoneme-experiences occurred prior to other\nphoneme-experiences \u2013 for example, that one heard\n\u2018mad\u2019 and not \u2018dam\u2019 (Bennett 1966:\n228\u20139). Dicker (2004: 201\u20132) remarks that we may be able\nto determine accurately the order some of our past states by means of\nsuch memories, but we cannot ascertain the order of most of our past\nexperiences in this way. He therefore advocates a restriction of the\nargument to the experiences we can correctly order but not in the way\nBennett adduces. Fourth, many commentators have noted that we might\nhave perceived time directly. Guyer, as we just saw, suggests that all\nof our conscious experiences might have featured a time clock, much\nlike a television sportscast or a video camera (1987: 244; cf.\nStrawson 1966). But as Dicker points out, in actual fact our\nexperience does not have any such feature, and he is content for\nPremise (4), that time itself cannot serve as the reference whereby I\ncorrectly determine the temporal order of my past experiences, to\nstate a merely contingent fact about us (2004, 2008). Chignell (2010)\nexpresses a concern about interpretations of the Refutation in which\nit is merely a contingent fact about us that the alternative methods\nfor determining the temporal order of my past experiences are\nunavailable, for then the conclusion, that we perceive objects in\nspace, would inherit such mere contingency, which he argues to be at\nodds with Kant\u2019s hopes for the Refutation. Fifth, commentators\ndiffer on the relation that must obtain between the objects in space\nand the experiences whose temporal order we can correctly determine.\nGuyer argues that the relation must be causal, since \u201cthe states\nof the self are judged to have a unique order just insofar as they are\njudged to be caused\u2026 by the successive states of enduring\nobjects\u201d (Guyer 1987: 309; cf. Dicker 2004: 200, 2008). By\ncontrast, in Allison\u2019s view we require the temporal order of\nobjects in space only as a backdrop against which to determine the\ntemporal order of our experiences; \u201can enduring, perceivable\nobject (or objects) is required to provide a frame of reference by\nmeans of which the succession, coexistence, and duration of\nappearances in a common time can be determined\u201d (Allison 1983:\n201). If the object in space that provides the reference is the sun,\nfor example, the states of the sun don\u2019t need to cause my\nexperiences for me to determine their temporal order by means of those\nstates.\n\nThree of the most pressing problems that have been raised for the\nRefutation are the following. First, a skeptic might well reject\nPremise (1) on the ground of a general skepticism about memory\n(Allison 1983: 306\u20137). Bertrand Russell, for example, suggests\nthat for all I know I was born five minutes ago (Russell 1912). On\nthis skeptical hypothesis, I would be mistaken in my belief that I had\nexperiences A, B, and C which occurred more than five minutes ago,\nfirst A, then B, and lastly C. Plausibly, a skeptic who claimed that\nwe lack adequate justification for a belief that external objects\nexist would likely also be disposed to claim that I lack justification\nfor my belief that I had experiences that occurred in the past in that\nspecific temporal order. Thus Kant\u2019s supposition that Premise\n(1) yields leverage against an external-world skeptic is mistaken (cf.\nDicker 2008, Chignell 2010).\n\nSecond, consider the claim that my mental states (or the mental\nsubject itself) are as suited as objects in space to function as a\nreference whereby I can correctly judge the temporal order of my past\nexperiences. Suppose I had available as such a reference only the mere\nmental appearance of a digital clock in one corner of my field of\nconsciousness. This would not clearly be less effective than an actual\nclock in space. To this one might reply, with Dicker, that there are\nno actual mental states that are adequate to serve as such a\nreference. However, and this is the deeper worry, on Berkeley\u2019s\nidealist view according to which the esse (to be) of objects\nin space is their percipi (to be perceived), any spatial\nobjects would be nothing more than mental states of some subject, or\naspects of those states, but Berkeleyan spatial perceptions would be\nas adequate a reference by which to determine the temporal order of my\npast experiences as perceptions of spatial objects that are in some\nsense distinct from my mental states (cf. Allison 1983: 300\u20131;\nVogel 1993; Chignell 2010).\n\nThird, one might contend that Kant\u2019s Refutation demonstrates\nthat the reference in question must be (relatively) permanent, and\nthat there is nothing in the Berkeleyan spatial realm that satisfies\nthis requirement. However, to this one might respond that the\nreference by which I determine the temporal order of my past\nexperiences need not be permanent in a way that cannot be satisfied by\nBerkeleyan spatial objects. If in the corner of my field of\nconsciousness featured distinct momentary flashes, every second,\nindicating the date and time to the second, I would be able to\ndetermine the temporal order of my past experiences by their means\n(cf., van Cleve, reported in Dicker 2004: 207).\n\nA note on the second of these concerns: Several commentators have\nargued that Kant\u2019s Refutation of Idealism is meant to undermine\nany metaphysical sort of idealism, including metaphysical idealisms\nthat have been attributed to Kant (Guyer 1987: 317\u201329). But\nwhile this reading has interesting support, one should hesitate to\nendorse it solely on the ground that Kant maintains that spatial\nobjects are distinct from the states of the perceiver. On a plausible\nmetaphysical interpretation of Kant\u2019s idealism, the\nesse of objects in space is not their percipi, since\nKant\u2019s spatial objects, by contrast with Berkeley\u2019s, are\nrecognition-transcendent. In Berkeley\u2019s position, a\nsubject\u2019s perception of an oar in the water as crooked is not a\nmisperception, for \u201cwhat he immediately perceives by sight is\nnot in error, and so far he is in the right,\u201d and it is\nmisleading only because it is apt to give rise to mistaken inferences\n(Berkeley 1713: Third Dialogue); while for Kant this perception is in\nerror. In Kant\u2019s view, the oar is recognition-transcendent by\nvirtue of the Second Postulate\u2019s provision that the actuality of\nsuch objects is determined causally:\n\nThat which is bound up with the material conditions of experience,\nthat is, with sensation, is actual (wirklich). (A218=B266)\n\n\nThe actual is that which conforms to the system of empirical causal\nlaws (A225/B272ff.), and because the crookedness of the oar does not\nso conform, it is not actual. How the Second Postulate rules out the\nexistence of the apparent spatial objects of dreams and hallucinations\nis spelled out in the third note to the Refutation of Idealism:\n\nNote 3. From the fact that the existence of outer things is required\nfor the possibility of a determinate consciousness of the self, it\ndoes not follow that every intuitive representation of outer things\ninvolves the existence of those things, for their representation can\nvery well be the product merely of the imagination (as in dreams and\ndelusions). Such representation is merely the product of previous\nouter perceptions, which, as has been shown, are possible only through\nthe reality of outer objects\u2026 Whether this or that supposed\nexperience be not purely imaginary, must be ascertained from its\nspecial determinations, and through its congruence with the criteria\nof all actual experience (wirklichen Erfahrung).\n(B278\u20139 cf.A376, cf. A492=B520\u20131)\n\n\nThe objects of dreams and hallucinations don\u2019t meet the\ncriterion of actuality of the Second Postulate, that is, according\nwith the laws of causality. Thus while in Berkeley\u2019s view the\nesse of spatial things consists in their being perceived by\nthe senses, for Kant they are the objects of the correct\ncausal/scientific account of the contents of our outer experience.\nThis causal criterion allows that a spatial object, or, more\nprecisely, the matter from which it is constituted, is (at least\nrelatively) permanent \u2013 which would seem ruled out in\nBerkeley\u2019s position, since the spatial object does not last any\nlonger than the idea does. (Berkeley does say that the ideas of what\n\u201care called real things\u201d differ from \u201cthose excited\nin the imagination\u201d by \u201cbeing less regular, vivid, and\nconstant\u201d (Berkeley 1710, Principles Part I, 33), but\nfor him this difference does not challenge or undermine the claim that\nthe esse of a physical object is its percipi.) None\nof this forces a metaphysical realist as opposed to an idealist\nreading of Kant.\n\nYet at the same time, according to the second concern, the Refutation\nis inadequate even if its ambition is restricted to demonstrating the\nexistence of merely metaphysically ideal but nonetheless\nrecognition-transcendent objects outside us in space. For granting\nthat the Refutation establishes that for me to determine the temporal\norder of my past experiences I must perceive objects in space, it\nfails to show that I need to perceive spatial objects any more\nrealistic than the Berkeleyan ones. More generally, the worry is that\nBerkeleyan version of idealism has the resources to yield as adequate\na reference for me to determine the temporal order of my past\nexperiences as any rival position Kant is plausibly interpreted as\nendorsing, and that for this reason the Refutation falls short of its\naim.\n",
