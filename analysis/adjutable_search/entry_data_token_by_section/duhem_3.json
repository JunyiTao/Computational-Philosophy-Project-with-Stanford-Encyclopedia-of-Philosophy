    "main_text": "Philosophy of Science || Against \u201cCartesian Method\u201d: Metaphysics and Models\n2.2 Against \u201cCartesian Method\u201d: Metaphysics and Models\n\n\nIn the overview of all his scholarly works in the document\nsupporting his candidacy for membership to the Acad\u00e9mie des\nSciences Duhem contrasted the methodology of energetics with the two\nleading methodologies at the time, what he called the method of the\nCartesians and that of the Newtonians. We have discussed his critique\nof the Newtonians; we now turn to that of the Cartesians. The salient\nfeature of energetics was that \u201cthe principles it embodies and\nfrom which it derives conclusions do not at all aspire to resolve the\nbodies we perceive or the motions we report into imperceptible bodies\nor hidden motions\u201d (1917, 151 [EHPS, 232]). What energetics\noffered was a formal theory, with the character of logical system,\nwhich instead of reducing physical qualities in the manner of\nmechanistic theories, limited itself to marking by means of a numerical\nscale the various intensities of such qualities. Duhem\u2019s critique\nof mechanistic theories (or the method of Cartesians and atomists) was\nthat they are not autonomous:\n\n\nThe physicist who wishes to follow them can no longer use the\nmethods proper to physics exclusively. \u2026 Here he enters the\ndomain of cosmology. He no longer has the right to shut his ears to\nwhat metaphysics wishes to tell him about the real nature of matter;\nhence, as a consequence, through dependence on metaphysical cosmology,\nhis physics suffers from all the uncertainties and vicissitudes of that\ndoctrine. Theories constructed by the method of the Cartesians and\natomists are also condemned to infinite multiplication and to perpetual\nreformulation. They do not appear to be in any state to assure\nconsensus and continual progress to science. (1917, 152 [EHPS,\n233\u201334])\n\n\nFor Duhem, the contemporary scientist who exemplified the method of\nthe \u201cCartesians\u201d was James Clerk Maxwell. Duhem issued\nthree interconnected complaints against Maxwell\u2019s work: (i)\nMaxwell\u2019s theory is overly bold or not systematic enough; (ii) it\nis too dependent on models; and (iii) its concepts are not continuous\nwith those of the past.\n\n\nThe justification Duhem gives for the accusation of extreme boldness is\nthat:\n\n\nWhen a physicist discovers facts unknown until then, when his\nexperiments have allowed him to formulate new laws that the theory had\nnot foreseen, he must first try with the greatest care to represent\nthese laws, to the required degree of approximation, as consequences\nof admitted hypotheses. Only after having acquired the certainty that\nthe magnitudes treated until now by the theory cannot serve as symbols\nfor the observed quantities, that received hypotheses cannot flow from\nthe established laws, is he authorized to enrich physics with a new\nmagnitude, to complicate it with a new hypothesis (1902,\n7).\n\n\nAccording to Duhem, the founders of electrodynamics\u2014Coulomb,\nPoisson, and Ampere\u2014followed these principles, but Maxwell did\nnot. Duhem cites with approbation Ampere\u2019s attempt to represent\nthe attraction or repulsion of currents in wires using Coulomb\u2019s\nformula. He also praises the fact that Ampere abandoned the attempt\nonly after experimental facts about the magneto-optical rotation,\ndiscovered by Faraday, showed clearly that Ampere could not succeed in\nthe attempt. But, again, according to Duhem, Maxwell does not follow\nthese principles. In fact, he goes so far as to accuse Maxwell of\nfollowing the \u201cinverse path\u201d:\n\n\nAt the moment when Maxwell introduced a new magnitude in\nelectrodynamics, the displacement currents, at the moment when he\nmarked, as essential hypotheses, the mathematical form of the laws to\nwhich this magnitude should be submitted, no properly observed\nphenomenon required this extension of the theory of currents; that\ntheory was sufficient for representing, if not all phenomena known\nuntil then, at least all those whose experimental study had achieved a\nsufficient degree of clearness. No logical necessity pressed Maxwell to\nimagine a new electrodynamics. (1902, 8.)\n\n\nAs a result, Maxwell reversed \u201cwith an incredible\nrashness\u201d the natural order according to which physical theory\nevolves\u2014he broke with the past before he needed to.\n\n\nDuhem is well known for his attack on the use of models in physical\nscience. At first, it seems that Duhem tries to link his attack on\nmodel building with his espousal of instrumentalism for the physical\nsciences. He accuses the English scientists of believing that \u201cto\nunderstand physical phenomena is to compose a model\u201d (1914, 103;\n1954, 71\u201372) and of \u201cconfusing model with theory\u201d (1913,\n102; 1954, 71). He specifically blames Maxwell of these\nmisunderstandings, indicating that in his 1855\u201356 essay Maxwell\nproposed only \u201cto illustrate\u201d the theory of dielectrics,\nwhereas in his 1861\u201362 essay he proposed \u201cto represent or to\nexplain\u201d the electrical and magnetic actions by a mechanical\nmodel. Duhem even seems scornful of Maxwell\u2019s interchangeable use\nof the verbs \u201cto represent\u201d and \u201cto explain.\u201d\nHe states, \u201cfor an English physicist, the two words have the same\nmeaning\u201d (1902, 9).\n\n\nFor Duhem there is a crucial difference between representing and\nexplaining. He divides theories into two large categories, explanatory\nand purely representative theories, and argues that physical theories\nshould not be considered as explanatory, but as purely representative\nor classificatory. The argument, as we have seen, is that, in order for\nphysical theory to be explanatory, it would have to be subordinate to\nmetaphysics and not autonomous. The reference to the two words having\nthe same meaning for Maxwell and English scientists is thus a reference\nto what Duhem would consider a confusion about the aim of physical\ntheory, one that arises in the identification of the model with the\ntheory, in thinking that what is represented by the theory and/or model\nis real.\n\n\nBut Duhem broadens the critique of model building to include\nmathematical models along with mechanical models. He decides that, for\nan English scientist, theory is \u201cfor him neither an explanation\nnor a rational classification of physical laws, but a model of these\nlaws, a model not built for the satisfying of reason but for the\npleasure of the imagination\u201d (1914, 117; 1954, 81). The complaint\nis clear: model building has no real place in physical theory (beyond a\nminor heuristic role); it can neither be grounded in realism, in the\nthought that physical theories are explanatory structures, nor in\ninstrumentalism, in the thought that physical theories are\nclassificatory or representative structures. In fact, model building is\nnot even connected to the higher intellectual faculty of reason but to\nthe lower faculty of imagination. So, ultimately, Duhem\u2019s attack\non model building is rooted in something more fundamental than his\ninstrumentalist methodology for the physical sciences.\n\n\nDuhem banishes model building from physical theory (as he previously\nbanished Maxwell\u2019s rashness) because model building breaks with\nhistorical continuity; in fact, model building is not only historically\nnon-continuous, but present models are even often\n\u201cnon-continuous\u201d among themselves. Some model builders even\nfind pleasure in building two or more models of the same law. The fact\nthat the English physicist can accept disparate models, breaking up the\nhistorical continuity of science and even its present unification, is\nwhat shocks Duhem; it is what reconfirms for him that English physics\nis not the work of reason, but the work of imagination.\n\n\nA principle of historical continuity is invoked in the conclusion of\nDuhem\u2019s primary work on Maxwell. Duhem evaluates there an\ninterpretation of Maxwell\u2019s work he attributes to Heaviside,\nHertz, and Cohn, among others. He quotes Hertz as stating that:\n\u201cwhat is essential in Maxwell\u2019s theories is Maxwell\u2019s\nequations.\u201d He takes this to be Hertz\u2019s way of salvaging\nwhat is valuable in Maxwell from the midst of logical errors and\nincoherence, which are not only difficult to correct, but which have\nfrustrated many illustrious mathematicians. But Duhem cannot accept\nHertz\u2019s implied criterion of identity for physical theories. He\nasserts that he might accept such a criterion for algebra but \u201ca\nphysicist is not an algebraist\u201d:\n\n\nAn equation does not simply bear on letters; such letters symbolize\nphysical magnitudes which must be either measurable experimentally or\nformed from other measurable magnitudes. Therefore, if a physicist is\ngiven only an equation, he is not taught anything. To this equation\nmust be joined rules by which the letters that the equation bears upon\nare made to correspond to the physical magnitudes they represent. And\nthat which allows us to know these rules is the set of hypotheses and\narguments by which one has arrived at the equations in question. [The\nset of rules] is the theory that the equations summarize in a symbolic\nform: in physics, an equation, detached from the theory that leads\nto it, has no meaning. (1902, 223.)\n\n\nDuhem proceeds to detail two complete theories that can recover\nMaxwell\u2019s equations within a logical and coherent structure, the\ntheories of Boltzmann and Helmholtz. The only criterion he gives for\nchoosing between these two theories, though without elaborating upon it\nor justifying it, is that Helmholtz\u2019s theory is to be preferred\nover Boltzmann\u2019s theory because it is a natural \u201cextension\nof the doctrines of Poisson, Ampere, Weber, and Newmann; it leads\nlogically from the principles posited at the start of the nineteenth\ncentury to the most seductive consequences of Maxwell\u2019s theories,\nfrom the laws of Coulomb to the electromagnetic theory of light; [it\ndoes so] without losing any of the recent victories of electrical\nscience; it reestablishes the continuity of tradition\u201d (1902,\n225).\n\n\nDuhem does not attempt to justify his criterion of historical\ncontinuity in his study of Maxwell, perhaps because he previously\nbroached the question. In an early methodological article, he asserts:\n\nIF WE RESTRICT OURSELVES TO INVOKING CONSIDERATIONS OF PURE\nLOGIC, we cannot prevent a physicist from representing different\nsets of laws, or even a single group of laws, by several irreconcilable\ntheories. We cannot condemn incoherence in the development of physical\ntheory. (1893, 366 and elsewhere; [EHPS, 66])\nThus historical continuity as a consideration falls outside of pure\nlogic and outside reasons of physics proper, but deals with the\nrelation between physics and metaphysics, what Duhem calls\n\u201cmetaphysical cosmology.\u201d Surprisingly, if one considers\nhim as an instrumentalist, for Duhem, we must judge a physical theory\nin comparison to an ideal and perfect theory that provides the total\nand adequate metaphysical explanation of the nature of material\nthings, that is, the natural classification of laws. (For more on Duhem on natural classification and conventionalism, see Dion 2013, Dion 2017, and Ivanova 2015.) For that reason, a coherent physical theory is more perfect than an incoherent set of\nincompatible theories. Elaborating upon this point and commenting upon\nthe connection between cosmology\u2014that is, metaphysics, natural\nclassification, or the ideal form of physical theory\u2014and\nphysical theory itself, Duhem asserts:\n\n\nIt is not enough for cosmologists to know very accurately the doctrines\nof contemporary theoretical physics; they must also know past\ndoctrines. In fact, current theory need not be analogous with\ncosmology, but with the ideal theory toward which current theory tends\nby a continual progress. Therefore, it is not up to philosophers to\ncompare physics as it is now with their cosmology, by congealing\nscience in some manner at a precise moment of its evolution, but rather\nto appreciate the development of theory and to surmise the goal toward\nwhich it is directed. Now, nothing can guide them safely in\nconjecturing the path that physics will follow if not the knowledge of\nthe road it has already covered. (1914, 460; 1954, 303.)\n\n\nDuhem supports this statement using an analogy with the trajectory\nof a ball. We cannot guess its end point with an instant glance at the\nball, but we can prolong its trajectory if we followed the ball from\nthe moment it was struck. So we cannot guess the end point of physical\ntheory, the natural classification, by looking at any particular\ntheory. We must appeal to the trajectory of physical theory, to its\nhistory, to enable us to tell whether any particular theory is likely\nto contribute toward the ultimate natural classification. Duhem\u2019s\ndoctrine of natural classification provides the grounds for various\ncommentators to argue that Duhem is not an instrumentalist, that his\nphilosophy of science considered as a whole looks more like convergent\nor motivational realism (see Maiocchi in Ariew and Barker 1990 and\nothers).\n",
