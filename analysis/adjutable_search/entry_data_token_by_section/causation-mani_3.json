Structural Equations, Directed Graphs, and Manipulationist Theories of Causation\n\nA great deal of recent work on causation has used systems of equations\nand directed graphs to represent causal relationships. Judea Pearl\n(e.g., Pearl 2009) is an influential example of this approach. His\nwork provides a striking illustration of the heuristic usefulness of a\nmanipulationist framework in specifying what it is to give such\nsystems a causal\n interpretation.[1]\n Pearl characterizes the notion of an intervention by reference to a\nprimitive notion of a causal mechanism. A functional causal model is a\nsystem of equations \\(X_i = F(Pa_i, U_i)\\) where \\(Pa_i\\) represents\nthe parents or direct causes of \\(X_i\\) that are explicitly included\nin the model and \\(U_i\\) represents an error variable that summarizes\nthe impact of all excluded variables. Each equation represents a\ndistinct causal mechanism which is understood to be\n\u201cautonomous\u201d in the sense in which that notion is used in\neconometrics; this means roughly that it is possible to interfere with\nor disrupt each mechanism (and the corresponding equation) without\ndisrupting any of the others. The simplest sort of intervention in\nwhich some variable \\(X_i\\) is set to some particular value \\(x_i\\)\namounts, in Pearl\u2019s words, to\n\n\nlifting \\(X_i\\) from the influence of the old functional mechanism\n\\(X_i = F_i(Pa_i, U_i)\\) and placing it under the influence of a new\nmechanism that sets the value \\(x_i\\) while keeping all other\nmechanisms undisturbed. (Pearl 2009: 70; I have altered the notation\nslightly)\n\n\nIn other words, the intervention disrupts completely the relationship\nbetween \\(X_i\\) and its parents so that the value of \\(X_i\\) is\ndetermined entirely by the intervention. Furthermore, the intervention\nis surgical in the sense that no other causal relationships in the\nsystem are changed. Formally, this amounts to replacing the equation\ngoverning \\(X_i\\) with a new equation \\(X_i = x_i\\), substituting for\nthis new value of \\(X_i\\) in all the equations in which \\(X_i\\) occurs\nbut leaving the other equations themselves unaltered. In a graphical\nrepresentation of causal relationships (see below), an intervention of\nthis sort on a variable \\(X_i\\) breaks or removes all other arrows\ndirected into \\(X_i\\), so that the value of \\(X_i\\) is now completely\nfixed by the intervention. Pearl\u2019s assumption is that the other\nvariables that change in value under this intervention will do so only\nif they are effects of \\(X_i\\).\n\nAgain, if we want to use this notion of an intervention to elucidate\nwhat it is for \\(X\\) to cause \\(Y\\) it is natural to move to a\ncounterfactual formulation in the sense that what matters for whether\n\\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\) is what would happen to \\(Y\\) if an intervention on\n\\(X\\) of the sort described above were to occur. Following what has\nbecome an established usage I will call such counterfactuals, the\nantecedents of which correspond to claims about interventions (If\n\\(X\\) were set to value \\(x\\) under an intervention, then\u2026)\ninterventionist counterfactuals. These are the\ncounterfactuals that (under some interpretation, perhaps not\nnecessarily involving Pearl\u2019s particular notion of an\nintervention) seem most suitable for formulating a manipulability\ntheory of causation.\n\nThe need for such a counterfactual formulation raises several\nquestions that will be explored in more detail below. First, how\nshould one understand (what is the appropriate interpretation of or\nsemantics for) the counterfactuals in question? Without attempting to\nanswer this question in detail, it seems plausible that if\ninterventionist counterfactuals are to be useful in elucidating causal\nclaims, their semantics must be different from the familiar\nLewis/Stalnaker possible world semantics in some respects, as is\nargued by Woodward (2003), Briggs (2012), and Fine (2012). For\nexample, on the Lewis/Stalnaker semantics, counterfactuals with\nlogically or metaphysically impossible antecedents are always\nvacuously true, but if there are causal claims that might be\nassociated with such counterfactuals, we don\u2019t want them to be\nautomatically true (cf.\n \u00a712).\n\nA second difference is that an interventionist counterfactual of form\n\u201cIf an intervention were to set \\(X=x\\), then \\(Y= y\\)\u201d is\nmost naturally understood as requiring for its truth that all\nsuch interventions (or at least all such interventions within the\nbackground circumstances in which the causal model of interest is\ntaken to hold) would be followed by \\(Y= y\\). This has the consequence\nthat, for example, \u201cstrong centering\u201d which holds for the\nLewis/Stalnaker semantics, does not hold for interventionist\ncounterfactuals. According to strong centering the actual world is\nmore similar to itself than any other possible world. Thus if both\n\\(p\\) and \\(q\\) hold in the actual world, then the\n\u201ccounterfactual\u201d (that is, subjunctive conditional)\n\u201cif \\(p\\) were the case, \\(q\\) would be the case\u201d, is\nautomatically true, As an illustration of the difference this makes,\nsuppose that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) obey the following\nintervention\u2013supporting functional relation: If and only if \\(X=\n1\\).5, then \\(Y= 3\\). Suppose that in the actual world, \\(X= 1.5,\\)\n\\(Y= 3.\\) Now consider the counterfactual \\(C\\) : If \\(1\\lt X \\lt 3,\\)\nthen \\(Y=3.\\) Assuming strong centering, the closest world to the\nactual world in which the antecedent of \\(C\\) is true is the actual\nworld in which \\(X=1.5\\). In this world, \\(Y=3\\), so \\(C\\) is true. By\ncontrast, \\(C\\) is false under an interventionist interpretation,\nsince values of \\(X\\) between 1 and 3 other than 1.5 are not followed\nby 3. Arguably the interventionist verdict that \\(C\\) (and the\nassociated causal claim that \u201c\\(X\\) being between 1 and 3 causes\n\\(Y=3)\\)\u201d are false is the correct view. Several other\ndifferences between interventionist counterfactuals and the\nLewis/Stalnaker semantics will be noted below.\n\nA second general issue, related to the one just described, concerns\nthe sense, if any, in which interventions must be\n\u201cpossible\u201d and the bearing of this on the truth of the\nassociated causal claims. Returning to the notion of intervention\nassociated with Pearl above, note that this notion says nothing about\nwhether there is an actual or even possible causal factor that might\naccomplish the surgical modification Pearl describes. We may if we\nwish represent such an intervention \\(I\\) by means of arrow directed\ninto the variable \\(X_i\\) that is intervened on which breaks all other\narrows directed into \\(X_i\\) (and Pearl sometimes uses this\nrepresentation) but both the \\(I\\) variable and this arrow seem\ndispensable. We could instead just think of \\(X_i\\) as set to some new\nvalue in the arrow-breaking or equation replacement manner described\nabove, with no further restrictions on when such a setting operation\nis possible (or when it is permissible or legitimate to invoke it). I\nwill call this a setting intervention. This contrasts with an\nalternative conception of interventions and their connection to causal\nclaims according to which the truth of a claim like \u201c\\(X\\)\ncauses \\(Y\\)\u201d requires that interventions on \\(X\\) must be\n\u201cpossible\u201d in some non-trivial sense of this notion, which\nthen must be specified. (In other words, the truth of \u201c\\(X\\)\ncauses \\(Y\\)\u201d requires both that \\(Y\\) changes under an\nintervention on \\(X\\) and that this intervention be\npossible.) When a possibility condition of this sort is imposed, I\nwill say we are making use of a possibility constrained\nnotion of intervention. Use of this notion raises the difficult\nquestion of how the relevant notion of possibility should be\nunderstood. I will suggest below that the best way of making sense of\nthis notion is in terms of some notion of conceptual or mathematical\n(or if you like, \u201cmetaphysical\u201d) coherence\u2014roughly\nspeaking, the issue is whether there is an appropriately empirically\ngrounded theoretical/mathematical apparatus that allows for a coherent\ndescription of the possible intervention in question and allows us to\ndetermine what would happen if the intervention were realized. In some\ncases (see below) such a description may be available even though the\nintervention in question may not be physically\n possible.[2]\n Recognizing obvious worries about the clarity of this notion of\npossibility (which in my view should be acknowledged by defenders of\nthis notion), one might think that it is preferable to always employ\nthe setting notion in formulating an interventionist account. However,\nas we shall see, formulations in terms of the \u201cpossibility\nconstrained\u201d notion have appealing features (they seem to do a\nbetter job of capturing the truth conditions for some causal claims)\nand a number of writers seem to rely on such a conception.\n\nReturning to Pearl, and following his framework, let us represent the\nproposition that the value of \\(X\\) has been set by an intervention to\nsome particular value, \\(x_0\\), by means of a \u201c\\(\\do\\)\u201d\noperator \\((\\do(X=x_0)\\), or more simply, \\(\\do x_0)\\). It is\nimportant to understand that conditioning on the information that the\nvalue of \\(X\\) has been set to \\(x_0\\) will in general be\nquite different from conditioning on the information that the value of\n\\(X\\) has been observed to be \\(x_0\\) (see Meek and Glymour\n1994; Pearl 2009). For example, in the case in which \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nare joint effects of the common cause \\(Z\\), and \\(X\\) does not cause\n\\(Y\\), \\(P(Y/X=x_0) \\ne P(Y)\\); that is, \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) are not\nindependent. However, \\(P(Y/\\do(X=x_0) = P(Y)\\); that is, \\(Y\\) will\nbe independent of \\(X\\), if the value of \\(X\\) is set by an\nintervention. This is because the intervention on \\(X\\) will break the\ncausal connection from \\(Z\\) to \\(X\\), so that the probabilistic\ndependence between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) that is produced by \\(Z\\) in the\nundisturbed system will no longer hold once the intervention occurs.\nIn this way, we may capture Menzies\u2019 and Price\u2019s idea that\n\\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\) if and only if the correlation between \\(X\\) and\n\\(Y\\) would persist under the right sort of manipulation of \\(X\\).\n\nThis framework allows for a simple definitions of various causal\nnotions. For example, Pearl defines the \u201ccausal effect\u201d of\n\\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) associated with the \u201crealization\u201d of a\nparticular value \\(x\\) of \\(X\\) as:\n\n(C)\\(P(Y\n\\mid{\\do x})\\)\n\n\nthat is, as the distribution that \\(Y\\) would assume under an\nintervention that sets the value of \\(X\\) to the value \\(x\\). Again,\nit is obvious that this is a version of a counterfactual account of\ncausation.\n\nOne of the many attractions of this approach is that it yields a very\nnatural account of what it is to give a causal interpretation to a\nsystem of equations of the sort employed in the so-called causal\nmodeling literature. For example, if a linear regression equation \\(Y\n= aX + U\\) makes a causal claim, it is to be understood as claiming\nthat if an intervention were to occur that sets the value of \\(X=x_0\\)\nin circumstances \\(U=u_0\\), the value of \\(Y\\) would be \\(y = ax_0 +\nu_0\\), or alternatively that an intervention that changes \\(X\\) by\namount \\(dx\\) will change \\(Y\\) by amount \\(a\\; dx\\). As another\nillustration consider the system of equations\n\n(1)\\(Y = aX +\nU\\)\n(2) \\(Z = bX +\ncY + V\\)\n\n\nWe may rewrite these as follows:\n\n(1)\\(Y = aX +\nU\\)\n(3) \\(Z = dX +\nW\\)\n\n\nwhere \\(d = b + ac\\) and \\(W = cU + V\\). Since (3) has been obtained\nby substituting (1) into (2), the system (1)\u2013(2) has exactly the\nsame solutions in \\(X, Y\\), and \\(Z\\) as the system (1)\u2013(3).\nSince \\(X, Y\\) and \\(Z\\) are the only measured variables,\n(1)\u2013(2) and (1)\u2013(3) are \u201cobservationally\nequivalent\u201d in the sense that they imply or represent exactly\nthe same facts about the patterns of correlations that obtain among\nthe measured variables. Nonetheless, the two systems correspond to\ndifferent causal structures. (1)\u2013(2) says that \\(X\\) is a direct\ncause of \\(Y\\) and that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are direct causes of \\(Z\\). By\ncontrast, (1)\u2013(3) says that \\(X\\) is a direct cause of \\(Y\\) and\nthat \\(X\\) is a direct cause of \\(Z\\) but says nothing about a causal\nrelation between \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\). We can cash this difference out\nwithin the interventionist/manipulationist framework described\nabove\u2014(2) claims that an intervention on \\(Y\\) will change \\(Z\\)\nwhile (1)\u2013(3) denies this. (Recall that an intervention on \\(Y\\)\nwith respect to \\(Z\\) must not be correlated with any other cause of\n\\(Z\\) such as \\(X\\), and will break any causal connection between\n\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).) Thus while the two systems of equations agree about\nthe correlations so far observed, they disagree about what would\nhappen under an intervention on \\(Y\\). According to an\ninterventionist/manipulationist account of causation, it is the system\nthat gets such counterfactuals right that correctly represents the\ncausal facts.\n\nOne possible limitation of the notion of a setting intervention (or at\nleast Pearl\u2019s characterization of it) concerns the scope of the\nrequirement that an intervention on \\(X_i\\) leave intact all\nother mechanisms besides the mechanism that previously determined the\nvalue of \\(X_i\\). If, as Pearl apparently intends, we understand this\nto include the requirement that an intervention on \\(X_i\\) must leave\nintact the causal mechanism if any, that connects \\(X_i\\) to its\npossible effects \\(Y\\), then an obvious worry about circularity\narises, at least if we want to use the notion of an intervention to\ncharacterize what it is for \\(X_i\\) to cause \\(Y\\). A closely related\nproblem is that given the way Pearl characterizes the notion of an\nintervention, his definition\n (C)\n of the causal effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\), seems to give us not the\ncausal contribution made by \\(X = x\\) alone to \\(Y\\) but rather the\ncombined impact on \\(Y\\) of this contribution and whatever\ncontribution is made to the value of \\(Y\\) by other causes of \\(Y\\)\nbesides \\(X\\). For example, in the case of the regression equation \\(Y\n= aX+U\\), the causal effect in Pearl\u2019s sense of \\(X=x\\\n\\textrm{on}\\ Y\\) is apparently \\(P(Y) = ax + U\\), rather than, as one\nmight expect, just \\(ax\\). In part for these reasons (and for other\nreasons, described below), Woodward (2003) and Woodward and Hitchcock\n(2003) explore a different way of characterizing the notion of an\nintervention which does not make reference to the relationship between\nthe variable intervened on and its effects. For Woodward and\nHitchcock, in contrast to Pearl, an intervention \\(I\\) on a variable\n\\(X\\) is always defined with respect to a second variable \\(Y\\) (the\nintent being to use the notion of an intervention on \\(X\\) with\nrespect to \\(Y\\) to characterize what it is for \\(X\\) to cause \\(Y)\\).\nSuch an intervention \\(I\\) must meet the following requirements\n (M1\u2013M4):\n\n(M1)\\(I\\)\nmust be the only cause of \\(X\\); i.e., as with Pearl, the intervention\nmust completely disrupt the causal relationship between \\(X\\) and its\nprevious causes so that the value of \\(X\\) is set entirely by\n\\(I\\),\n(M2)\\(I\\)\nmust not directly cause \\(Y\\) via a route that does not go through\n\\(X\\) as in the placebo example,\n(M3)\\(I\\)\nshould not itself be caused by any cause that affects \\(Y\\) via a\nroute that does not go through \\(X\\), and\n(M4)\\(I\\)\nleaves the values taken by any causes of \\(Y\\) except those that are\non the directed path from \\(I\\) to \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\) (should this exist)\nunchanged.\n\n\nThis characterization makes explicit reference to conditions that must\nbe satisfied by the intervention variable \\(I.\\) Although perhaps not\nmandatory, questions about what it means for such an \\(I\\) to be\npossible and how we are to understand the antecedents of the\nassociated interventionist counterfactuals (\u201cIf an intervention\nsatisfying\n (M1)\u2013(M4)\n on \\(X\\) were to occur,\u2026\u201d) thus arise in a natural way\non this characterization\u2014or at so I will assume in what\nfollows.\n\nPutting aside these issues about possibility for the present, the most\nnatural way of defining the notion of causal effect in the framework\nassociated with\n (M1)\u2013(M4)\n is in terms of the difference made to the value of \\(Y\\) by\na change or difference in the value of \\(X\\). (This is also\neffectively the definition of causal effect adopted in Rubin 1974.\nFocusing on differences in this way allows us to isolate the\ncontribution made to \\(Y\\) by \\(X\\) alone from the contribution made\nto \\(Y\\) by its other causes. Moreover, since in the non-linear case,\nthe change in the value of \\(Y\\) caused by a given change in the value\nof \\(X\\) will depend on the values of the other causes of \\(Y\\), it\nseems to follow that the notion of causal effect must be relativized\nto a background context \\(B_i\\) which incorporates information about\nthese other values. In deterministic contexts, we might thus define\nthe causal effect on \\(Y\\) of a change in the value of \\(X\\) from\n\\(X=x\\) to \\(X=x'\\) in circumstances \\(B_i\\) as:\n\n(CD) \\(Y_{\\do\nx, B_i} - Y_{\\do x', B_i}\\)\n\n\nthat is, as the difference between the value that \\(Y\\) would take\nunder an intervention that sets \\(X=x\\) in circumstances \\(B_i\\) and\nthe value that \\(Y\\) would take under an intervention that sets\n\\(X=x'\\) in \\(B_i\\), where the notion of an intervention is now\nunderstood in terms of\n (M1)\u2013(M4)\n rather than in the way recommended by Pearl. In non-deterministic\ncontexts, the characterization of causal effect is less\nstraightforward, but one natural proposal is to define this notion in\nterms of expectations: If we let \\(E P_{\\do x, B_{i}}(Y)\\) be the\nexpectation of \\(Y\\) with respect to the probability distribution\n\\(P\\) if \\(X\\) is set to \\(X=x\\) by means of an intervention, then the\ncausal effect on \\(Y\\) of a change in \\(X\\) from \\(X=x''\\) to \\(X=x\\)\nmight be defined as: \\(E P_{\\do x, B_{i}}(Y) - E P_{\\do x', B_{i}}\n(Y)\\).\n\nThis Section will not attempt to adjudicate among these and various\nother proposals concerning the best way to characterize the notions of\nintervention and causal effect. Instead, we make the following comment\non the general strategy they embody. Note first that the notion of an\nintervention, when understood along either of the lines described\nabove, is an unambiguously causal notion in the sense that causal\nnotions are required for its characterization\u2014thus the proposals\nvariously speak of an intervention on \\(X\\) as breaking the causal\nconnection between \\(X\\) and its causes while leaving other causal\nmechanisms intact or as not affecting \\(Y\\) via a causal route that\ndoes not go through \\(X\\). This has the immediate consequence that one\ncannot use the notion of an intervention to provide a reduction of\ncausal claims to non-causal claims. Moreover, to the extent that\nreliance on some notion like that of an intervention is unavoidable in\nany satisfactory version of a manipulability theory, any such theory\nmust be non-reductionist. Indeed, we can now see that critics who have\ncharged manipulability theories with circularity have in one important\nsense understated their case: manipulability theories turn out to be\n\u201ccircular\u201d not just in the obvious sense that for an\naction or event \\(I\\) to constitute an intervention on a variable\n\\(X\\), there must be a causal relationship between \\(I\\) and \\(X\\),\nbut in the sense that \\(I\\) must meet a number of other causal\nconditions as well.\n",
