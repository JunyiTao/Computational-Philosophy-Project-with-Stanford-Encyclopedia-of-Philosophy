    "main_text": "Moral Intuitions and Conceptual Analysis || Cross-Cultural Experimental Moral Philosophy\n2.5 Cross-Cultural Experimental Moral Philosophy\n\nGuided by the idea that variation in some judgments might\nchallenge our trust in them (Machery 2017, Chapter 4), the\nnegative program has led experimental philosophers to examine whether\nmoral judgments vary across cultures and other demographic groups (see\nalso Graham et al. 2016; Doris et al. 2020). Early research\nfocused on the distinction between causing harm as a means or as a\nside effect, and failed to find any cultural variation using the\nfootbridge and the bystander versions of the trolley case (Hauser\net al. 2007; Moore et al. 2011), but a few articles have\nobserved differences among Americans, Russians and Chinese (Ahlenius\n& T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2012), English and Chinese (Gold et\nal. 2014), and Yali horticulturalists in Papua (Sorokowski\net al. 2020). A recent study of moral judgments in 45 countries found\nthat people find it less acceptable to cause someone\u2019s death as a\nmeans to prevent a greater harm than as a mere side effect; they\nalso find it less acceptable to cause someone\u2019s death as a means to\nprevent a greater harm when the death results from \u201cpersonal\nforce\u201d, i.e., when the force that impacts the victim originates\nin the agent\u2019s muscles; but the interaction between these two factors,\nwhich had been observed in the USA, was only found in\nWestern countries (Bago et al. 2022). Moral dilemmas that\ninvestigate the permissibility of causing harm to prevent a greater\nharm also elicit different judgments from men and women: in a\nmetaanalysis of 40 studies, men were more likely to find it\npermissible to cause harm to prevent a greater harm in this kind\nof moral dilemmas (Friesdorf et al. 2015). Hannikainen, Machery and\nCushman (2018) have also shown that Millenials are more likely to find\nit permissible to cause harm to prevent a greater harm in the\nfootbridge case than Gen Xers and Boomers, suggesting that the\nrelevant moral norms might have culturally evolved. \n\nVariation is not limited to sacrificial dilemmas (Stich and Machery in\npress). Cultural factors moderate the influence of valence on judgment\nabout the intentionality of action that was discussed above (Robbins,\nShepard and Rochat 2017): in two rural, traditional cultures\n(Samoa and Vanuatu) people were more likely to judge the good\nside effect than the bad side effect as intentional if the protagonist\nhad a high status.  \n\nAnother area of investigation focuses on the distinction between norms\nthat are thought to be moral and norms that aren\u2019t (see also Machery\nand Stich 2022 for the cross-cultural work on the\nmoral/conventional distinction). Buchtel et al. (2015) have shown that\nthe Mandarin translation of \u201cimmoral\u201d applies to a\nsurprisingly different set of behaviors than \u201cimmoral\u201d in\nEnglish: the former primarily applies to behaviors viewed as\nuncivilized, the latter often to harmful behavior (see also\nDranseika, Berni\u016bnas & Silius 2018).\nBerni\u016bnas (2020) extends this research to the Mongolian\ntranslation of \u201cmoral.\u201d Asking people to classify norms as\nmoral and non-moral, Levine and colleagues (2021) have also shown that\nreligious affiliation influences what counts as moral: religious Jews\nand non-believers have a very narrow moral domain, while Christians\nand Muslims tend to have a broad moral domain; surprisingly, Hindus\nfail to distinguish moral from non-moral norms (see\nalso Dranseika, Berni\u016bnas & Sousa 2016). This kind\nof findings has led Machery (2018) to propose that morality is a\ncultural invention that is not found in every culture (see also Stich\n2018).\n\nJudgments related to free will, control, blame, and punishment also\nvary across cultures (Hannikainen et al. 2019; for a different line of\ncross-cultural research on free will, see Sarkissian et al.\n2010). In most cultures, people deny free will and control (and\nthus blame and punish less) when the agent\u2019s action is described\nas antecedently caused; by contrast, they assign free will and\ncontrol when the action originates stems from the agent\u2019s own\nwill even if she could not have done otherwise (a situation\nillustrated by Frankfurt cases). East Asians, however, differ in\ntreating these two kinds of situations similarly: if the surrounding\ncircumstances undercut the agent\u2019s capacity to have done\notherwise, they tend to deny her free will and control. East Asians\u2019\ngreater attention to contextual factors when explaining behavior\n(Choi, Nisbett and Norenzayan 1999) might account for this finding\n(for related research, see Buchtel et al. 2018). Berniunas and\ncolleagues (2021) have even argued that the concept of free will is a\nculture-specific concept, not found in most cultures. \n",
