    "main_text": "Induction and Abduction\n7. Induction and Abduction\n\nSonia Roca-Royes and Bob Fischer both take a modest approach to the\nepistemology of modality. Roca-Royes (2017, 2018) divides the space of\nepistemological investigation via the ontological distinction between\nconcrete and abstract entities. In a 2017 work she offers a\nsimilarity-based account of our knowledge of de re modality\nfor concrete entities. And in her (2018) she offers an account of\nmodal knowledge for abstract entities. Fischer (2017) divides the\nspace of epistemological investigation via a topical distinction\nbetween ordinary and extraordinary claims.\n\nRoca-Royes aims to answer the question: how can we come to know what\nis possible for a particular entity? A starting point for her account\nis the following example:\n\n\nI know that the wooden table in my office, Messy, is not broken. How\ndo I know that? I see it. Although not broken, Messy can break. How do\nI know that? Because the table I had before Messy, which we may call\n\u201cTwin-Messy\u201d, was a twin-sister of Messy, and it broke;\nand I know that Twin-Messy broke because I saw it. (Roca-Royes 2017:\n226)\n\n\nHer account can be unfolded as follows:\n\n(RR1)\n\\(S\\) knows (via perception, say) that Twin-Messy actually\nbroke.\n(RR2)\n\\(S\\) knows that what is actual is possible.\n(RR3)\nSo, \\(S\\) can warrantedly transition to: It is possible\nthat Twin-Messy breaks.\n(RR4)\n\\(S\\) knows that \u201cobjects similarly made out of the same\nsort of materials are susceptible to similar effect\u201d (2017:\n227).\n(RR5)\n\\(S\\) knows that Messy is similarly made out of the same sort of\nmaterials as Twin-Messy was made.\n(RR6)\nSo, \\(S\\) can warrantedly transition to: It is possible\nthat Messy breaks.\n\n\nCrucial to Roca-Royes\u2019s account is the notion of an\nepistemic counterpart, whereby \\(a\\) is an epistemic\ncounterpart of \\(b\\) just in case there\u2019s a point in each of\n\\(a\\)\u2019s and \\(b\\)\u2019s timelines where they are relevantly\nsimilar (e.g., made from the same kind of materials) and, in virtue of\nthis, what has happened to a informs us of what could happen\nto \\(b\\). In the example: Twin-Messy\u2019s breaking informs us that\nMessy can break. Premise\n (RR4)\n plays a major role in Roca-Royes\u2019 account. She calls the\nknowledge at stake here nomic-like (2017: 229) and clarifies\nthat it is supported inductively, since it heavily relies on\nthe uniformity of nature.\n\nFischer (2017) proposes a Theory-Based Epistemology of\nModality, TEM, for extraordinary or philosophical modal claims.\nThe basic idea is that we are justified in believing an extraordinary\nmodal claim, \\(m\\), only if we are justified in believing a theory\n\\(T\\) from which \\(m\\) follows. For example, we are justified in\nbelieving that mind-body dualism is metaphysically possible only if we\nare justified in believing a theory \\(T\\) from which mind-body dualism\nfollows. Importantly, Fischer holds that abductive methods\nfor theory choice, such as using theoretical virtues like simplicity,\nare central to being justified in believing a theory. If the theory\n\\(T\\) from which one would be justified in believing that mind-body\ndualism is metaphysically possible is not the simplest\ntheory, all else being equal, then one would not be justified\nin believing it, and thus not be justified in believing that mind-body\ndualism is metaphysically possible.\n\nFor other discussions involving abduction see Hanrahan (2017), who\ndiscusses it in the case of imagination, Biggs (2011), who discusses\nit in the context of conceivability, and Biggs and Wilson (2021), who\ndiscuss it in relation to Carnap and anti-realism. Importantly, for\nWilson and Biggs abduction is an a priori enterprise.\nCritical Questions for Induction and Abduction\n\nThe Relevant Similarity Question: Generalizing\n (RR4)\n above, Roca-Royes speaks of relevant similarity of an object with its\ncounterpart. But what are the relevant respects of similarity, and how\ndo we know that? This seems to be the most crucial question in\nRoca-Royes\u2019 account. Roca-Royes addresses the issue of relevant\nand irrelevant similarity for the concrete cases she discusses in her\n2017 work (like Messy and Twin-Messy). However, Roca-Royes concedes\nthat the details for the generalizability of these considerations\nabout relevant similarity are still to be worked out in full detail.\n(For further critical discussion of Roca-Royes\u2019 account see\nPrelevi\u0107 2015)\n\nThe Priority Question: Fischer\u2019s TEM makes it\nseem that our justification for extraordinary modal claims always\ncomes by way of having a theory first. However, one might wonder if\nsometimes we have justification for extraordinary modal claims prior\nto building theories that would justify them. Consider the\nfollowing:\n\nFor Berkeley, it is inconceivable for a tree to exist unperceived\nby anyone.\nIf \\(p\\) is inconceivable for \\(S\\), then \\(S\\) has justification\nfor believing that p is impossible.\nSo, Berkeley has justification for believing that it is impossible\nfor a tree to exist, or anything for that matter, unperceived by\nanyone.\nIdealism is the view that existence depends on perception.\nEsse est percipe.\nSo, Berkeley has justification for idealism.\n\n\nHowever, Fischer\u2019s TEM appears to hold that Berkeley must first\nbelieve with justification Idealism, for him to believe that a tree\ncannot exist unperceived by anyone. This result appears to contradict\nhow we sometimes use conceivability to gain justification in order to\nbelieve a theory. (For further critical discussion of Fischer\u2019s\naccount, see Biggs 2017 and Wirling 2020).\n",
