    "main_text": "Theoretical Frameworks || Other Approaches\n3.3 Other Approaches\n\nThough the impression often painted of the research landscape in\nquantum gravity is an either/or situation between string theory and\nloop quantum gravity, in reality there are very many more options on\nthe table. Some (e.g., Callender and Huggett 2001, W\u00fcthrich 2004\n(Other Internet Resources section); J. Mattingly 2005) have argued\nthat semiclassical gravity, a theory in which matter is quantized but\nspacetime is classical, is at least coherent, though not quite an\nempirically viable option (we discuss this below). Other approaches\ninclude twistor theory (currently enjoying a revival in conjunction\nwith string theory), Bohmian approaches (Goldstein & Teufel,\n2001), causal sets (see Sorkin 2003, in the Other Internet Resources\nsection) in which the universe is described as a set of discrete\nevents along with a stipulation of their causal relations, and other\ndiscrete approaches (see Loll, 1998). Causal set theory has begun to\nstimulate some philosophical interest on account of the claims, by\nphysicists, to the effect that the theory embodies a notion of\nobjective becoming or temporal passage based on the notion of the\n\u2018birth\u2019 of spacetime atoms (see, e.g., Dowker 2014; for a\nskeptical response, see Huggett 2014; W\u00fcthrich, 2012, pursues\ninstead the structuralist leanings of causal set theory). \n\nAlso of interest are arguments to the effect that gravity itself may\nplay a role in quantum state reduction (Christian, 2001; Penrose,\n2001; also briefly discussed below). A fairly comprehensive overview\nof the current approaches to quantum gravity can be found in Oriti\n(2009). In this entry we have chosen to focus upon those approaches\nthat are both the most actively pursued and that have received\nmost attention from philosophers. Let us now turn to several\nmethodological and philosophical issues that arise quantum gravity\nresearch.\n",
