    "main_text": "Thomas Reid || Are SQs dispositions or causal bases?\n6.1 Are SQs dispositions or causal bases?\n\nSome texts suggest that secondary qualities as known by the senses are\ndispositions, notably:\n\n\n[color] is a certain power \u2026 in bodies that in fair daylight\nexhibits to the eye an appearance which is very familiar to us\nalthough it hath no name. (Reid 1765 [1997: 87])\n\n\nBut there are more texts that identify SQs with the unknown causes of\nfamiliar sensations, such as:\n\n\nThe qualities in bodies we call heat and cold are\nunknown. They are only conceived by us, as unknown causes or occasions\nof the sensations which we give the same names. (Reid 1765 [1997: 54;\nespecially 86]; 1785 [2002: 202\u201304], among others)\n\n\nNowadays it is generally accepted that a disposition and the cause of\nits manifestations are distinct; it is not possible that they be the\nsame thing.\n\nWolterstorff offers this argument:\n\n\nif green were a disposition in things to cause certain sensations\nunder certain conditions and not the physical basis of that\ndisposition, we would know what it was. (Wolterstorff 2000: 112)\n\n\nThis might well be based on a paragraph in Essays on the\nIntellectuaI Powers of Man (Reid 1785 [2002: 203\u201304]). It\nstates that feeling informs us that the fire is hot but not what heat\nis in the fire; it notes that this may seem to be a contradiction but\nsays it ought to be accepted. It allows that if we had no notion of\nheat we could not understand the assertion that fire is hot, and\nconcludes \u201cwe have a notion, but it is a relative notion. We\nknow they are the causes of certain known effects\u201d (Reid 1785\n[2002: 203\u201304]). This might naturally be understood to invoke\nthe obscurity of relational specifications of qualities to dispel the\nseeming contradiction.\n\nVan Cleve (2015: 105\u2013110) dismisses Wolterstorff\u2019s\nargument on the ground that there is an equally good counter argument\nas follows. It is an epistemic principle that you know X is\nF only if you know what it is to be F; Reid thinks we know of\nmany things that they are green; so, we must know what it is to be\ngreen. Someone might object that Reid adheres to a different epistemic\nprinciple in the passage we just discussed. In a note citing this\ntext, Van Cleve admits Reid\u2019s position is unclear but takes the\nlast part of the passage to say the relative notion enables us to know\nwhat it is to be green, namely, to manifest certain sensations. In his\nopinion, Reid favors this view of SQs. Reading the passage this way\nrenders the contradiction irrelevant but leaves the many texts that\nwould seem to identify SQs with the unknown causes of known effects\nout of account. As Nichols (2007: 6.4) puts it, the dispositional\ninterpretation makes nonsense of Reid\u2019s frequent claims that he\ndoes not know what SQs are. Nichols finds evidence of the causal basis\ntheory in Reid\u2019s use of SQ terms in talking about the causes of\nSQ sensations and concludes that all relevant texts considered, we\nshould take him to accept a physical microstructural account of SQs\n(Nichols 2006: 6.6).\n\nVan Cleve elaborates on the dispositional interpretation in two ways.\nFirst, noting that Reid is drawn to the view that SQs are unknown\ncauses, he suggests that although it was not available to Reid, a\nsecond order dispositional account might accommodate the conflicting\ntexts: to have a SQ is to have a property P such that\nP would cause certain sensations in circumstances C\n(Van Cleve 2016: 109). Second, he notes that if SQs are dispositions\nmanifested by human responses, they are relational properties, whereas\nPQs seem to be intrinsic. He argues that the latter is borne out under\na test of intrinsicality along lines proposed by G.E. Moore (Winkler\n2016: 225\u201331 challenges this; Van Cleve 2016: 240\u201344 is\nhis response). From this, Van Cleve concludes that Reid\u2019s P/SQ\ndistinction rests on a metaphysical foundation (Van Cleve 2016:\n110\u201312).\n",
