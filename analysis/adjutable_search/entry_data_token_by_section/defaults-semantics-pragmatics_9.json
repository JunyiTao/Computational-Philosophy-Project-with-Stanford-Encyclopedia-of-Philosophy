Defaults, Salience, and Literalness\n\nIn pragmatic theory, the term \u2018default\u2019 is often used in\nassociation with the term \u2018salience\u2019, so it is important\nto clarify the similarities and differences between them. For Giora\n(e.g., 2003; Giora & Givoni 2015), salience and defaultness are two\ndifferent concepts. Salience depends merely on \u2018accessibility in\nmemory due to such factors as frequency of use or experiential\nfamiliarity\u2019 (Giora 2003: 33). For her, salience concerns\nmeanings, while defaultness concerns interpretations:\n\nDefining defaultness in terms of an automatic response to a stimulus\npredicts the superiority of default over non-default counterparts,\nirrespective of the degree of non-salience, figurativeness, context\nstrength\u2026. (Giora & Givoni 2015: 291)\n\n\nSo, salience is here a graded phenomenon (see here Giora 2003 for her\nexperimentally supported Graded Salience Hypothesis). Salience is also\nindependent from the literalness of the interpretation: the highly\naccessible meaning is not always the literal one. According to Giora\n(2003: 33), \u2018literality is not a component of salience\u2019.\nThe latter is caused by experience, frequency of use, and as such is\nreflected in the accessibility in memory. Her experiments demonstrated\nthat \u2018familiar instances of metaphor and irony activated their\nsalient (figurative and literal) meanings initially, regardless of\ncontextual information\u2019 (p. 140).\n\nReconciling defaultness with salience may, however, be problematic in\nparticular cases, leading to the proposal of the degrees of\ndefaultness (Giora & Givoni 2015), and to a rather\ncounterintuitive diluting of the concept of a default. For example,\nsarcasm can rely on non-salient but default interpretation\n\u2013 non-salient when the interpretation is compositionally put\ntogether instead of being processed as a conventionalised unit.\n\nOn the other hand, for Jaszczolt (e.g., 2016a) defaultness relies\nprecisely on salience that leads to automatic meaning retrieval. She\ncalls this view Salience-Based Contextualism: the meaning of an\nutterance is derived through a variety of interacting processes, some\nof which rely on automatic interpretations such as cognitive defaults\nor socio-cultural and world knowledge defaults identified in the\ntheory of Default Semantics and discussed in Section 1.8. Such\ndefaults are defaults for the context and for the speaker, but\nsalience that predicts them is not. According to Salience-Based\nContextualism, words and structures can trigger salient, automatically\nretrieved meanings. This is guaranteed by the fact that language is a\nsocio-cultural as well as a cognitive phenomenon and as such is shaped\nby its common use in discourse on the one hand, and by the structure\nand operations of the brain on the other (see Jaszczolt 2016a: 50).\nSalience is situation-free (although not always co-text free \u2013\nsee above on fluid characters), defaultness is not: it is easy to\nimagine a speaker who does not make use of the available salient\ninterpretation because he or she lacks the necessary sociocultural\nbackground, knowledge of the laws of physics, or is guided by the\ncontext towards a different interpretation. Defaultness applies to a\nflexible unit on the basis of which an interpretation is formed (a\nfluid character). Defaults in conversation result from emergent\nintentionality (Haugh 2008, 2011): they rely on the process of\nco-construction of meaning discussed in Section 4. So, conversational\ndefaults subsume salient meanings \u2013 literal or not, such as\nGiora\u2019s salient meanings understood as conventional,\nprototypical, familiar, or frequent.\n\nOne of the important corollaries of this salience-based defaultness is\nthe possible redundancy of the literal/nonliteral distinction. If\nwords exhibit strong influences on each other in a string as well as\ninfluences from the situation of discourse (sometimes called\n\u2018lateral\u2019 and \u2018top-down influences\u2019,\nrespectively \u2013 see e.g., Recanati 2012), then we have little\nreason for postulating literal meaning. For example, in (25), we have\nlittle reason for postulating \u2018literal\u2019 meanings of\n\u2018city\u2019 or \u2018asleep\u2019: either of the words may\naccommodate to fit the other, and the appropriate interpretation will\nfollow.\n\n(25)The city is asleep. (from Recanati 2012: 185).\n\nIf \u2018city\u2019 means \u2018inhabitants of the city\u2019,\n\u2018asleep\u2019 applies to it directly. If it means the place\nwith its infrastructure, \u2018asleep\u2019 has to adjust to mean\nsomething to the effect of \u2018quiet\u2019, \u2018dark\u2019 or\n\u2018showing no movement\u2019. But neither of the processes has a\nclear point of departure: there is no obvious, clearly definable move\nfrom literal to non-literal. Such co-occurrence comes with degrees of\nsalience of certain meanings. Such options can also be viewed as\n\u2018probabilistic meanings\u2019 that are \u2018contextually\naffirmed\u2019, to use Allan\u2019s (2011: 185) terminology, through\nnonmonotonic inferences either in the co-text or by some other factor\nin the common ground.\n\nHowever, probabilistic meanings presuppose ambiguity, while in general\nthe salience- and default-oriented semantics and pragmatics relies on\nthe assumption of underspecification. While in the case of (26)\u2013(27)\nan ambiguity account appears justified when viewed from the\nperspective of the inventory of the lexicon in a language system (in\nthat one would expect an analogy from \u2018leopard\u2019 and\n\u2018fox\u2019 to \u2018lamb\u2019 and \u2018goat\u2019, while\nin the context of the sentence this analogy is not present, as shown\nin (26a) and (27a)), most cases of lexical adjustment cannot be traced\nback to properties of entries in the lexical inventory.\n\n(26)Jacqueline prefers leopard to fox.\n(27)Harry prefers lamb to goat.\n(26a)Jacqueline prefers leopard skin to fox fur.\n(27a)Harry prefers eating lamb to eating goat.\n\n(from Allan 2011: 180). Probabilistic meaning, according to Allan,\nought to be included in the lexicon: a lexeme ought to be listed in\nthe lexicon with different interpretations, annotated for their\nprobability and circumstances in which this meaning is likely to\noccur. He calls such probabilistic meanings \u2018grades of\nsalience\u2019.\n\nIt is evident that this proposal brings us to the territory of\nvector-based semantics in computational linguistics, while, on the\nother hand, accounts based on intention- and context-driven adjustment\nsuch as Recanati\u2019s and Jaszczolt\u2019s pull in the direction\nof post-Gricean pragmatics. But as Sections 1.1\u20131.8 demonstrate, the\ntwo traditions are not necessarily incompatible. Lexical salience and\nradical contextualism about the lexicon point in the same direction as\ndistributional accounts in computational semantics: we have\nprobabilities of certain meanings because these are meanings derived\nfrom the \u2018company a word keeps\u2019, to adapt Firth\u2019s\n(1957: 11) famous dictum. All in all, content words are strongly\ncontext-dependent \u2013 to the extent that perhaps indexicality\nought to be viewed not as a defining feature of some lexical items but\nas a gradable feature of the entire lexicon. But what counts as\nindexicality is a separate theoretical question that cannot be pursued\nhere.\n\nNext, there is one more reason why salience has to be clearly\ndistinguished from defaultness. Let us consider demonstratives. The\nobject referred to by using \u2018that\u2019 can be located with the\nhelp of (i) the recognition of the speaker\u2019s intention, or (ii)\nthe act of pointing, or even (iii) the presence of a particular\nprominent object in the visual field of the interlocutors. All these\ncombine to delimit the concept of salience: such an object has to be\n(made) salient for the linguistic demonstration to succeed. Here\nsalient meaning is entirely, or almost entirely (allowing for\nthe grammatical rendering of e.g., the proximal/distal distinction)\ndetermined by the given context and by the speaker\u2019s knowledge\nthat it is the relevant context (see Lewis 1979 on\nscorekeeping; Cappelen and Dever 2016 for a discussion). What is\nimportant for us here is that salience can be produced by the\nuse of a context-dependent term: objects are brought to salience by\nthe use of an indexical. Salience so understood is still compatible\nwith the situation-independent concept of salience discussed above (to\ndistinguish it from defaultness) in that it is the semantic meaning,\nthe character (Kaplan 1989) of the demonstrative that triggers the\nbringing-to-salience process.\n\nNow, on the one hand, linguistic research informs us that expressions\nwith thin semantic content such as anaphorically used demonstrative\npronouns or personal pronouns are employed for referents whose\ncognitive status is high. In other words, they are used when the\nobject is in focus of attention or at least activated in memory\n(Gundel et al. 1993; see Jaszczolt 2002: 140\u2013149 for a\ndiscussion). On the other hand, when combined with an act of\ndemonstration, the object can be made salient. Cappelen and\nDever (2016) discuss here two types of successful referring by\ndemonstratives: pointing and intending (i.e. (i) and (ii) above),\ncontrasted with prominence (i.e. (iii) above). The first creates\nsalience, while the latter pertains to extant salience; the first\nbrings entities into focus, while the latter exploits their in-focus\ncognitive status. What is of particular interest to semanticists (of\nboth orientations discussed here, Gricean and computational) is that\nthe first type allows for accommodation (Lewis 1979): objects are made\nmore salient when communication requires it.\n\nTo conclude, salience clearly differs from defaultness but for\nexpressions (words, phrases, sentences) for which delimiting default\ninterpretations makes sense, salience can provide an explanans.\n",
