    "main_text": "Ontology\n7. Ontology\n\nGrice\u2019s ontological views are liberal. As Grice says when\ncommenting on the mind\u2014body problem in \u2018Method in\nPhilosophical Psychology\u2019,\n\nI am not greatly enamoured of some of the motivations which prompt the\nadvocacy of psychophysical identifications; I have in mind a concern\nto exclude such \u2018queer\u2019 or \u2018mysterious\u2019\nentities as souls, purely mental events, purely mental properties and\nso forth. My taste is for keeping open house for all sorts of\nconditions of entities, just so long as when they come in they help\nwith the housework. Provided that I can see them work, and provided\nthat they are not detected in illicit logical behaviour (within which\nI do not include a certain degree of indeterminacy, not even of\nnumerical indeterminacy), I do not find them queer or mysterious at\nall\u2026. To fangle a new ontological Marxism, they work\ntherefore they exist, even though only some, perhaps those who\ncome on the recommendation of some form of transcendental argument,\nmay qualify for the specially favoured status of entia\nrealissima. To exclude honest working entities seems to me like\nmetaphysical snobbery, a reluctance to be seen in the company of any\nbut the best objects (1975, 30\u201331).\n\n\nOur discussion of psychological explanation shows what Grice had in\nmind in his reference to entities that \u201ccome on the\nrecommendation of some form of transcendental argument, [and hence]\nmay qualify for the specially favoured status of entia\nrealissima.\u201d Suppose\u2014as Grice thinks\u2014certain\nway of thinking, certain categories, are part of what is\nentrenched. Then there are certain concepts or categories that we\ncannot avoid applying to reality.\n\nThis theme will not be pursued further here; rather, we turn to the\nmore \u201cMarxist\u201d side of Grice\u2019s ontology: the claim\nthat if entities work, they exist. We illustrate this point with the\nconcept of a proposition. The critical role of that notion in\nGrice\u2019s theory of meaning motivates our focus on it. Quinean\ncriticisms of the notion have placed under it under a cloud of\nsuspicion, a cloud many see as hanging ominously over Grice\u2019s\ntheory.\n\nOne of Quine\u2019s arguments is that synonymy is not a well-defined\nequivalence relation, the identity conditions for propositions are\nunclear and there is \u2018no entity without identity\u2019. On this\nissue, Grice is not committed to an equivalence relation of synonymy\n(thus his remark above about indeterminacy), and he parts company with\nQuine over whether clear identity conditions are required. Grice, as\nnoted earlier, argues for such conditions. But the acceptability of\nhis theory of meaning does not depend on the success of that defense.\nWithin the theory of meaning, propositions are theoretical entities to\nbe understood by the role in the theory, and that role, according to\nGrice, does not demand a strict criterion of identity. Rather: if they\nwork they exist. It is worth noting in this regard that there are many\nrespectable entities for which we do not have criteria or identity.\nSuppose my favorite restaurant moves. Is it a new restaurant with the\nsame name? Or suppose it changes owners and names but nothing else? Or\nthat it changes menu entirely? Or that it changes chefs? It would be\nfoolish to look for a single criterion to answer these\nquestions\u2014the answers go different ways in different contexts.\nBut surely the concept of a restaurant is a useful one and restaurants\ndo exists. Quine and Grice differ on the theoretical usefulness of\npropositions. The main reason for disagreement is due to Quine\u2019s\nattitude that concepts such as belief and desire are of, at most,\nsecondary importance in the unified canonical science that is his\nstandard for ontology. Grice, as we have already noted, thinks that\neveryday psychological theory is of first importance.\n",
