Overview: Wittgenstein\u2019s Argument and its Interpretations\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s main attack on the idea of a private language is\ncontained in \u00a7\u00a7244\u2013271 of Philosophical\nInvestigations (though the ramifications of the matter are\nrecognizably pursued until \u00a7315). These passages, especially\nthose from \u00a7256 onwards, are now commonly known as \u2018the\nprivate language argument\u2019, despite the fact that he brings\nfurther considerations to bear on the topic in other places in his\nwritings; and despite the fact that the broader context, of\n\u00a7\u00a7243\u2013315, does not contain a singular critique of\njust one idea, namely, a private language\u2014rather, the passages\naddress many issues, such as privacy, identity, inner/outer relations,\nsensations as objects, and sensations as justification for sensation\ntalk, amongst others.\n\nNevertheless, the main argument of \u00a7\u00a7244\u2013271 is,\napparently, readily summarized. The conclusion is that a language in\nprinciple unintelligible to anyone but its originating user is\nimpossible. The reason for this is that such a so-called language\nwould, necessarily, be unintelligible to its supposed originator too,\nfor he would be unable to establish meanings for its putative\nsigns.\n\nWe should, however, note that Wittgenstein himself never employs the\nphrase \u2018private language argument\u2019. And a few commentators\n(e.g., Baker 1998, Canfield 2001 pp. 377\u20139, Stroud 2000 p. 69)\nhave questioned the very existence in the relevant passages of a\nunified structure properly identifiable as a sustained argument. This\nsuggestion, however, depends for its plausibility on a tendentiously\nnarrow notion of argument\u2014roughly, as a kind of proof, with\nidentifiable premisses and a firm conclusion, rather than the more\ngeneral sense which would include the exposure of a confusion through\na variety of reasoned twists and turns, of qualifications,\nweighings-up and re-thinkings\u2014and is a reaction against some\ndrastic and artificial reconstructions of the text by earlier writers.\nNevertheless, there is a point to be made, and the summary above\nconceals, as we shall see, a very intricate discussion.\n\nEven among those who accept that there is a reasonably self-contained\nand straightforward private language argument to be discussed, there\nhas been fundamental and widespread disagreement over its details, its\nsignificance and even its intended conclusion, let alone over its\nsoundness. The result is that every reading of the argument (including\nthat which follows) is controversial. Some of this disagreement has\narisen because of the notorious difficulty and occasional elusiveness\nof Wittgenstein\u2019s own text (sometimes augmented by problems of\ntranslation). But much derives from the tendency of philosophers to\nread into the text their own preconceptions without making them\nexplicit and asking themselves whether its author shared them. Some\ncommentators, for instance, supposing it obvious that sensations are\nprivate, have interpreted the argument as intended to show they cannot\nbe talked about; some, supposing the argument to be an obvious but\nunsustainable attempt to wrest special advantage from scepticism about\nmemory, have maintained it to be unsound because it self-defeatingly\nimplies the impossibility of public discourse as well as private; some\nhave assumed it to be a direct attack on the problem of other minds;\nsome have claimed it to commit Wittgenstein to behaviourism or\nverificationism; some have thought it to imply that language is, of\nnecessity, not merely potentially but actually social (this has come\nto be called the \u2018community view\u2019 of the argument).\n\nThe early history of the secondary literature is largely one of\ndisputation over these matters. Yet what these earlier commentators\nhave in common is significant enough to outweigh their differences and\nmake it possible to speak of them as largely sharing an Orthodox\nunderstanding of the argument. After the publication in 1982 of Saul\nKripke\u2019s definitely unorthodox book, however, in which he suggested\nthat the argument poses a sceptical problem about the whole notion of\nmeaning, public or private, disputation conducted by Orthodox rules of\nengagement was largely displaced by a debate on the issues arising\nfrom Kripke\u2019s interpretation. (However, there is overlap: Kripke\nhimself adheres to the community view of the argument\u2019s implications,\nwith the result that renewed attention has been paid to that issue,\ndispute over which began in 1954.) Both debates, though, show a\ntendency to proceed with only the most cursory attention to the\noriginal argument which started them off.\n\nThis rush to judgment about what is at stake, compounded by a\nwidespread willingness to discuss commentators\u2019 more accessible\naccounts of the text rather than confront its difficulties directly,\nhas made it hard to recover the original from the accretion of more or\nless tendentious interpretation which has grown up around it. Such a\nrecovery is one of the tasks attempted in this article. The criterion\nof success in this task which is employed here is one of coherence: a\ngood account should accommodate all of Wittgenstein\u2019s remarks in\n\u00a7\u00a7244\u2013271, their (not necessarily linear) ordering as\nwell as their content, and should make clear how these remarks fit\nwith the context provided by the rest of the book. (One of the\nproblems with many of the commentaries on this matter, especially the\nearlier ones, is that their writers have quarried the text for\nindividual remarks which have then been re-woven into a set of views\nsaid to be Wittgenstein\u2019s but whose relation to the original is\ntenuous. A striking example of this approach is Norman Malcolm\u2019s\nfamous and influential 1954 review of Philosophical\nInvestigations, which was commonly taken as an accurate\nrepresentation of Wittgenstein\u2019s own thinking and formed the target of\nmany \u201crefutations\u201d.)\n",
