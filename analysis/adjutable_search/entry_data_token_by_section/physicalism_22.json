    "main_text": "The Case Against Physicalism || Methodological Issues\n6. The Case for Physicalism\n\nHaving considered one side of the truth question, I will turn finally\nto the other: what reason is there for believing that physicalism is\ntrue?\n\nThe first thing to say when considering the truth of physicalism is\nthat we live in an overwhelmingly physicalist or materialist\nintellectual culture. The result is that, as things currently stand,\nthe standards of argumentation required to persuade someone of the\ntruth of physicalism are much lower than the standards required to\npersuade someone of its negation. (The point here is a perfectly\ngeneral one: if you already believe or want something to be true, you\nare likely to accept fairly low standards of argumentation for its\ntruth.)\n\nHowever, while it might be difficult to assess dispassionately the\narguments for or against physicalism, this is still something we\nshould endeavor to do. Here I will review two arguments that are\ncommonly thought to establish the truth of physicalism. What unites\nthe arguments is that each takes something from the physicalist\nworld-picture which we considered previously and tries to establish\nthe metaphysical this of physicalism.\n\nThe first argument is (what I will call) The Argument from Causal\nClosure. The first premise of this argument is the thesis of the\nCausal Closure of the Physical \u2014 that is, the thesis that every\nevent which has a cause has a physical cause. The second premise is\nthat mental events cause physical events \u2014 for example we\nnormally think that events such as wanting to raise your arm (a mental\nevent) cause events such as the raising of your arm (a physical\nevent). The third premise of the argument is a principle of causation\nthat is often called the exclusion principle (Kim 1993, Yablo 1992,\nBennett 2003). The correct formulation of the exclusion principle is a\nmatter of some controversy but a formulation that is both simple and\nplausible is the following:\n\nExclusion Principle\n\nIf an event e causes event e*, then there is no\nevent e# such that e# is non-supervenient on\ne and e# causes e*.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is the mental events are supervenient\non physical events, or more briefly that physicalism is true. For of\ncourse, if the thesis of Causal Closure is true then behavioral events\nhave physical causes, and if mental events also cause behavioral\nevents, then they must supervene on the physical if the exclusion\nprinciple is true. \n\nThe Argument from Causal Closure is perhaps the dominant argument for\nphysicalism in the literature today. But it is somewhat unclear\nwhether it is successful. (For some discussion see,\n Mental Causation).\n One response for the anti-physicalist is to reject the second premise\nand to adopt a version of what is called epiphenomenalism, the view\nthat mental events are caused by, and yet do not cause, physical\nevents. The argument against this position is usually epistemological:\nif pains don\u2019t cause pain behavior how can it be that your\ntelling me that you are in pain gives me any reason for supposing you\nare? It might seem that epiphenomenalists are in trouble here, but as\na number of recent philosophers have argued, the issues here are very\nfar from being settled (Chalmers 1996, Hyslop 1999). The crucial point\nis that the causal theory of evidence is open to serious\ncounterexamples so it is unclear that it can be used against\nepiphenomenalism effectively.\n\nA different sort of response is to reject the causal principles on\nwhich the argument is based. As against the exclusion principle, for\nexample, it is often pointed out that certain events are\noverdetermined. The classic example is the firing squad: both the\nfiring by soldier A and by soldier B caused the prisoner\u2019s death\nbut since these are distinct firings, the exclusion principle is\nfalse. However, while this line of response is suggestive, it is in\nfact rather limited. It is true that the case of the firing squad\nrepresents an exception to the exclusion principle \u2014 an\nexception that the principle must be emended to accommodate. But is\ndifficult to believe that it represents an exception that can be\nwidespread. A more searching response is to reject the very idea of\ncausal closure on the grounds, perhaps, that (as Bertrand Russell\n(1917) famously argued) causation plays no role in a mature portrayal\nof the world. Once again, however, the promise of this response is\nmore imagined than real. While it is true that many sciences do not\nexplicitly use the notion of causation, it is extremely unlikely that\nthey do not imply that various causal claims are true.\n\nThe second argument for physicalism is (what I will call) The\nArgument from Methodological Naturalism. The first premise of\nthis argument is that it is rational to be guided in one\u2019s\nmetaphysical commitments by the methods of natural science. Lying\nbehind this premise are the arguments of Quine and others that\nmetaphysics should not be approached in a way that is distinct from\nthe sciences but should rather be thought of as continuous with it.\nThe second premise of the argument is that, as a matter of fact, the\nmetaphysical picture of the world that one is led to by the methods of\nnatural science is physicalism. The conclusion is that it is rational\nto believe physicalism, or, more briefly that physicalism is true.\n\nThe Argument from Methodological Naturalism has received somewhat less\nattention in the literature than the Argument from Causal Closure. But\nit seems just as persuasive \u2014 in fact, rather more so. For how\nmight one respond? One possibility is to reject its first premise. But\nthis is not something that most people are attracted to (or at least\nare attracted to explicitly.)\n\nThe other possibility is to reject its second premise. However, if\nphysicalism can be clearly stated \u2014 admittedly, this is a big\n\u2018if\u2019 \u2014 it is not terribly clear what this would\namount to or what the motivation for it would be. In the first place,\nour earlier discussion shows that physicalism is not inconsistent with\nexplanatory autonomy of the various sciences, so that one should not\nreject physicalism merely because one can\u2019t see how to reduce\nthose sciences to others. In the second place, while it is perfectly\ntrue that there are examples of non-physicalist approaches to the\nworld \u2014 vitalism in biology is perhaps the best example \u2014\nthis is beside the point. The second premise of the Argument from\nMethodological Naturalism does not deny that other views are possible,\nit simply says that physicalism is the most likely view at the moment.\nFinally, one might be inclined to appeal to arguments such as the\nknowledge argument to show that physicalism is false, and hence that\nmethodological naturalism could not show that physicalism is false.\nHowever, this suggestion represents a sort of confusion about the\nknowledge argument. As we saw above, if successful the knowledge\nargument suggests, not simply that physicalism is false but that any\napproach to the world that is compatible with methodological\nnaturalism is false. But if that is so, it is mistaken to suppose that\nthe knowledge argument gives one any reason to endorse\nanti-physicalism if that is supposed to be a position compatible with\nmethodological naturalism.\n",
