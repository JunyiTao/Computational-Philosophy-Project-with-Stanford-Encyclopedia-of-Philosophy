    "main_text": "The History of Theories of Evil || Dualist and Privation Theories of Evil\n2.1 Dualist and Privation Theories of Evil\n\nThe history of theories of evil began with attempts to solve the\nproblem of evil, i.e., attempts to reconcile the existence of evil (in\nthe broad sense) with an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good God or\ncreator. Philosophers and theologians have recognized that to solve\nthe problem of evil it is important to understand the nature of evil.\nAs the Neoplatonist Plotinus put it \u201cThose inquiring whence Evil\nenters into beings, or rather into a certain order of beings, would be\nmaking the best beginning if they established, first of all, what\nprecisely Evil is\u201d (Plotinus, Enneads, I, 8, 1).\n\nOne theory of evil that provides a solution to the problem of evil is\nManichaean dualism. According to Manichaean dualism, the universe is\nthe product of an ongoing battle between two coequal and coeternal\nfirst principles: God and the Prince of Darkness. From these first\nprinciples follow good and evil substances which are in a constant\nbattle for supremacy. The material world constitutes a stage of this\ncosmic battle where the forces of evil have trapped the forces of\ngoodness in matter. For example, the human body is evil while the\nhuman soul is good and must be freed from the body through strict\nadherence to Manichaean teaching. The Manichaean solution to the\nproblem of evil is that God is neither all-powerful nor the sole\ncreator of the world. God is supremely good and creates only good\nthings, but he or she is powerless to prevent the Prince of Darkness\nfrom creating evil. (For more about Manichaeanism see Coyel 2009 and\nLieu 1985; Greenless 2007).\n\nSince its inception, Manichaean dualism has been criticized for\nproviding little empirical support for its extravagant cosmology. A\nsecond problem is that, for a theist, it is hard to accept that God is\nnot an all-powerful sole creator. For these reasons influential, early\nChristian philosophers such as Saint Augustine, who initially accepted\nthe Manichaean theory of evil, eventually rejected it in favor of the\nNeoplatonist approach. (See Augustine, Confessions; On\nthe Morals of the Manichaeans; Reply to Manichaeus;\nBurt, Augustine\u2019s World.)\n\nAccording to the Neoplatonists, evil does not exist as a substance or\nproperty but instead as a privation of substance, form, and goodness\n(Plotinus, Enneads, I, 8; See also O\u2019Brien 1996). For\ninstance, the evil of disease consists in a privation of health, and\nthe evil of sin consist in a privation of virtue. The Neoplatonist\ntheory of evil provides a solution to the problem of evil because if\nevil is a privation of substance, form, and goodness, then God creates\nno evil. All of God\u2019s creation is good, evil is a lack of being\nand goodness.\n\nOne problem with the privation theory\u2019s solution to the problem\nof evil is that it provides only a partial solution to the problem of\nevil since even if God creates no evil we must still explain why God\nallows privation evils to exist (See Calder 2007a; Kane 1980). An even\nmore significant problem is that the privation theory seems to fail as\na theory of evil since it doesn\u2019t seem to be able to account for\ncertain paradigmatic evils. For instance, it seems that we cannot\nequate the evil of pain with the privation of pleasure or some other\nfeeling. Pain is a distinct phenomenological experience which is\npositively bad and not merely not good. Similarly, a sadistic torturer\nis not just not as good as she could be. She is not simply lacking in\nkindness or compassion. She desires her victims\u2019 suffering for\npleasure. These are qualities she has, not qualities she lacks, and\nthey are positively bad and not merely lacking in goodness (Calder\n2007a; Kane 1980. See Anglin and Goetz 1982 and Grant 2015 for replies\nto these objections).\n",
