    "main_text": "Basic Ingredients || Principles of truth\n2.2 Principles of truth\n\nThe tradition, going back to Tarski (1935), is that the behavior of\nthe truth predicate \\(\\Tr\\) is described by the following\nbiconditional. \n\\[\\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner A\\right\\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow A.\\]\n\n\nIndeed, Tarski took the biconditional here to be the material\nbiconditional of classical logic. This is usually called the\nT-schema. For more on the T-schema, and Tarski\u2019s views\nof truth, see the entries on\n Alfred Tarski\n and\n Tarski\u2019s truth definitions.\n\nThe Liar paradox has been a locus of thinking about non-classical\nlogics (as we already saw a taste of, for instance, in the idea that\nbivalence might be rejected as part of a solution to the Liar). Thus,\nwe should stop to consider what principles should govern the truth\npredicate \\(\\Tr\\) if classical logic is not to hold.\n\nThe leading idea for what might replace the T-schema points to two\nsorts of \u2018rules\u2019 (e.g., two sorts of \u2018inference\nrules\u2019 in some sense) or principles that are characteristic of\nthe truth predicate. If you have a sentence \\(A\\), you can infer\n\\(\\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner A\\right\\urcorner)\\), that is, you can\n\u2018capture\u2019 \\(A\\) with the truth predicate. Conversely, if\nyou have \\(\\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner A\\right\\urcorner)\\), you can infer\n\\(A\\), that is, you can \u2018release\u2019 \\(A\\) from the truth\npredicate. In some logics, capture and release wind up being\nequivalent to the T-schema, but it is often helpful to break these\nup:\n\nCapture \\(A\\)\nimplies \\(\\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner A\\right\\urcorner)\\).\n(We also write this as \\(A \\vdash \\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner\nA\\right\\urcorner)\\).)\nRelease \\(\\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner\nA\\right\\urcorner)\\) implies \\(A\\).\n(We also write this as \\(\\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner A\\right\\urcorner) \\vdash\nA\\).)\n\n\nImplies here is a logical notion, though just which one, and\nwhat the options are, depends on what background logic is assumed. For\nour discussion, we think of it in so-called rule form: that the\nargument from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is valid, which we record (as above) via\nthe turnstile. In some logical settings (e.g., classical logic, in\nwhich a certain so-called deduction theorem holds), this is equivalent\nto the provability of a conditional, but in some settings, it is not.\nEither way, capture and release jointly make \\(A\\) and\n\\(\\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner A\\right\\urcorner)\\) logically equivalent in the\nsense of being interderivable. In strong forms, capture and release\ncan lead to the full intersubstitutability of \\(A\\) and\n\\(\\Tr(\\left\\ulcorner A\\right\\urcorner)\\) in extensional contexts. As\nwe discuss more in\n section 4.1,\n this is important to some views of the nature of truth. Thus,\n\\(\\vdash\\) is being used here as a schematic placeholder for a range\nof different logical notions, each of which will provide some notion\nof valid inference in some logical theory.\n\n(There are a number of logical subtleties here that we will not\npursue, especially about how to formulate rules, and which rules are\nconsistent. Different formulations of rules vary significantly in\nlogical strength as\n well.[4]\n See the entry on\n axiomatic theories of truth\n for more on how consistent forms of capture and release can be\nformulated in classical logic. In the terminology of Friedman and\nSheard (1987), the rule forms of capture and release are called\n\u2018T-Intro\u2019 and \u2018T-Elim\u2019, and the conditional\nforms \u2018T-In\u2019 and \u2018T-Out\u2019. We prefer the\nbroader terminology, since it highlights a general form of behavior\ncommon to a great variety of predicates and operators, e.g.,\nknowledge releases but doesn\u2019t capture;\npossibility captures but doesn\u2019t release; and so on;\nand truth is special in doing both.)\n",
