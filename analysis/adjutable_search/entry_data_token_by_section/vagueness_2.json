For instance,\n\nBase step: A one-day-old human being is a child.\nInduction step: If an \\(n\\)-day-old human being is a child, then\nthat human being is also a child when it is \\(n + 1\\) days old.\nConclusion: Therefore, a 36,500-day-old human being is a\nchild.\n\n\nThe conclusion is false because a 100-year-old man is clearly a\nnon-child. Since the base step of the argument is also plainly true\nand the argument is valid by mathematical induction, we seem to have\nno choice but to reject the second premise.\n\nGeorge Boolos (1991) observes that we have an autonomous case against\nthe induction step. In addition to implying plausible conditionals\nsuch as \u201cIf a 1-day-old human being is a child, then that human\nbeing is also a child when it is 2 days old\u201d, the induction step\nalso implies ludicrous conditionals such as \u201cIf a 1-day-old\nhuman being is a child, then that human being is also a child when\n36,500 days old\u201d.\n\nBoolos is puzzled why we overlook these clear counterexamples. One\nexplanation is that we tend to treat the induction step as a\ngeneric generalization such as \u201cPeople have ten\ntoes\u201d (Sorensen 2012) rather than a generalization with a\nquantifier such as \u2018all\u2019 or \u2018most\u2019. Whereas\nthe universal generalization \u201cAll people have ten toes\u201d is\nrefuted by a single person with eleven toes, the generic\ngeneralization tolerates exceptions.\n\nThis hypothesis is plausible for newcomers to the sorites paradox. But\nit is less plausible for those being tutored by Professor Boolos. He\nguides logic students to the correct, universal reading of the\ninduction step. When students drift to a generic reading, Boolos\nreminds them that the induction step is a generalization that\ntolerates no exceptions.\n\nGuided by Boolos\u2019 firm hand, logic students drive a\nsecond stake into the heart of the induction step (the\nentailment of preposterous conditionals). Yet the paradox seems far\nfrom dead. The hitch is that death for the induction step is life for\nits negation. The negation of the second premise classically implies a\nsharp threshold for childhood. For the falsehood of the induction step\nimplies the existential generalization that there is a number \\(n\\)\nsuch that an \\(n\\)-day-old human being is a child but is no longer a\nchild one day later.\n\nEpistemicists accept this astonishing consequence. They stand by\nclassical logic and conclude that vagueness is a form of ignorance.\nFor any day in the borderline region of \u2018child\u2019, there is\na small probability that it is the day one stopped being a child.\nNormally, the probability is negligible. But if we round down to zero,\nwe fall into into inconsistency.\n\nThis diagnosis is reminiscent of Carl Hempel\u2019s solution to the\nRaven Paradox. At first blush, we deny that a white handkerchief could\nconfer any degree of confirmation on \u2018All ravens are\nblack\u2019. But this is incompatible with us regarding a white\nhandkerchief as providing some confirmation of \u2018All non-black\nthings are non-ravens\u2019. Since this contrapositive is logically\nequivalent to \u2018All ravens are black\u2019, whatever confirms\none hypothesis confirms the other. Hempel advises us to regain\nconsistency by conceding that a white handkerchief slightly confirms\n\u2018All ravens are black\u2019. Similarly, Hempel might advise us\nto slightly raise the probability of a borderline child being a child\nupon learning that she is a day younger than previously believed.\n\nHempel\u2019s only reservation about indoor ornithology is\ninefficiency. Given how the actual world is arranged, more news about\n\u2018All ravens are black\u2019 can be gained outdoors. We do not\nbother to look indoors because the return on inquiry is too low.\nBottom-up Bayesians envisage extraordinary scenarios in which the\nreturn on inquiry could be high. However, even their ample imagination\nfails to yield a possible world in which a single day has a more\ndiscernible opportunity to make a difference to whether someone is a\nchild. All pressure to shift credence is exerted top down from\nprobability theory.\n\nTimothy Williamson (1994) traces our ignorance of the threshold for\nchildhood to \u201cmargin for error\u201d principles. If one knows\nthat an \\(n\\)-day-old human being is a child, then that human being\nmust also be a child when \\(n + 1\\) days old. Otherwise, one is right\nby luck. Given that there is a threshold, we would be ignorant of its\nlocation. Under a use theory of meaning, the threshold depends on many\nspeakers. Williamson characterizes this threshold as sharing the\nunpredictability of long-term weather forecasts. According to the\nmeteorologist Edward Lorenz, a tornado in Kansas could be precipitated\nby the flapping of a butterfly\u2019s wings in Tokyo.\n\nThe use theory of meaning does not apply to asocial languages. For\ninstance, psycholinguists postulate a language of thought that is not\nused for communication. This innate language is vague.\n\nNatural languages lexicalize only a small share of our concepts. The\nprimary bearers of vagueness are concepts rather than words (Bacon\n2018). Aphasia does not end vague thinking. Insofar as we attribute\nthinking to non-linguistic animals, we attribute vague thinking.\nPeirce\u2019s emphasis on a community of inquirers encourages a\nsociology of language. Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s attack on the\npossibility of a private language was intended to remove any rival to\na community-based approach to language. Yet asocial vagueness remains\nviable. This motivates some epistemicists to explain our ignorance\nmore metaphysically, say, as an effect of there being no truth-maker\nto control the truth-value of a borderline statement (Sorensen 2001,\nchapter 11).\n\nDebate over Williamson\u2019s margin for error principle draws us\ndeep into epistemology and modality (Yli-Vakkuri 2016). Preferring to\nexplore the shallows, some commentators survey attitudes weaker than\nknowledge. According to Nicholas Smith (2008, 182) we cannot even\nguess that the threshold for baldness is the 400th hair. Hartry Field\n(2010, 203) denies that a rational man can fear that he has just\npassed the threshold into being old. Hope, speculation, and wonder do\nnot require evidence but they do require understanding. So it is\nrevealing that these attitudes have trouble getting a purchase on the\nthreshold of oldness (or any other vague predicate). A simple\nexplanation is that bare linguistic competence gives us knowledge that\nthere are no such thresholds. This accounts for the comical air of the\nepistemicist. Just as there is no conceptual room to worry that there\nis a natural number between sixty and sixty one, there is no\nconceptual room to worry that one has passed the threshold of oldness\nbetween one\u2019s sixtieth and sixty-first birthday.\n\nAn old epistemicist might reply: My piecemeal confidence that a given\nnumber is not the threshold for oldness does not agglomerate into\ncollective confidence that there is no such number. If I wager against\neach number being the threshold, then I must have placed a losing bet\nsomewhere. For if I won each bet then there was no opportunity for me\nto make the transition to oldness. My bookie could have made a\n\u201cDutch book\u201d against me. He would have been entitled to\npayment without having to identify which bet I lost. Since\nprobabilities may be extracted from hypothetical betting behavior, I\nmust actually assign some small (normally negligible) probability to\nhypotheses identifying particular thresholds. So must you.\n\nStephen Schiffer (2003, 204) denies that classical probability\ncalculations apply in vague contexts. Suppose Donald is borderline old\nand borderline bald. According to Schiffer we should be just as\nconfident in the conjunction \u2018Donald is old and bald\u2019 as\nin either conjunct. Adding conjuncts does not reduce confidence\nbecause we have a \u201cvague partial belief\u201d rather than the\nstandard belief assumed by mathematicians developing probability\ntheory. Schiffer offers a calculus for this vagueness-related\npropositional attitude. He crafts the rules for vague partial belief\nto provide a psychological solution to the sorites\nparadox.\n\nThe project is complicated by the fact that vague partial beliefs\ninteract with precise beliefs (MacFarlane 2010). Consider a statement\nthat has a mixture of vague and precise conjuncts: \u2018Donald is\nold and bald and has an even number of hairs\u2019. Adding the extra\nprecise conjunct should diminish confidence. Schiffer also needs to\naccommodate the fact that some speakers are undecided about whether\nthe nature of the uncertainty involves vagueness. Even an idealized\nspeaker may be unsure because there is vagueness about the borders\nbetween vagueness-related uncertainty and other sorts of\nuncertainty.\n\nAttitudes toward determinacy vary over time. Bernard Williams (2010,\n162) says Thucydides (460\u2013400 BC) invented historical time.\nThucydides insists that any two events occurred simultaneously or one\noccurred before the other. Thucydides does not countenance a vague\n\u201colden days\u201d\u2014a period in which events fail to be\nchronologically ordered. Every event is situated on a single timeline.\nThere can be ignorance of when an event took place but there is always\na fact of the matter. With similar focus, Archimedes (287\u2013212\nBC) insists that every quantity corresponds to a specific number. No\nquantity, however large, is innumerable. In \u201cThe Sand\nReckoner\u201d Archimedes devises a special notation to express the\ntotal number of grains of sand. The reductionism of Enlightenment\nthinkers led them to further analysis of shades of gray into black and\nwhite dots of precision.\n\nIn a holistic reaction, the Romantics portray the new boundaries as no\nmore real than the grid lines of a microscope. The specimen under the\nslide lacks boundaries. Understanding does not require boundaries.\nOrganizing items along a spectrum is a natural form of classification.\nWe comprehend this analog grouping more readily and smoothly than we\ngrasp the digital groupings instilled by Descartes\u2019 algebraic\nrepresentation of space. If our metaphysics of classification is\nconstricted by a logic designed for mathematics, the sorites paradox\nwill make us see disorder where there is really order of a more fluid\nsort. Spontaneous arrangements will bring what order is permitted by\nthe subject matter. Romantic biologists take to the field and refuse\nto pen species within the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system.\nConfronted with novel phenomena such as evolution, magnetism and\nelectricity, Romantic scientists bypassed boundaries.\n\nA geologist views a pair of aerial photographs cross-eyed. His brain\nrecognizes the two images as representations of the same landscape.\nThe flat images fuse into a unifying stereoscopic perspective. The\nRomantics portray vague language as perceptively de-focussed.\nVagueness is not the cloudy vision of an old man with cataracts.\n\nThe epistemicist fits into the Thucydidean tradition of replacing\nindeterminacy with determinacy. Crispin Wright (2021, 393) compares\nthe epistemicist\u2019s postulation of hidden boundaries to the\nmathematical realist\u2019s postulation of a hidden Platonic realm.\nBoth the epistemicist and the mathematical realist add metaphysical\ninfrastructure to ensure truth will transcend our means of proof. This\ninfrastructure validates proofs of generalizations that are not\nconstructed from examples. The impossibility of finding a witness for\nan existential generalization, such as \u2018There is a youngest old\nman\u2019, is compatible with there being a non-constructive\nproof.\n\nDespite rearguard defenses by the Romantics, Newtonian physics\nappeared to show that empirical reality fits classical logic. The hard\nsciences illustrated the crystalline growth of determinacy. But in a\nshocking reversal, quantum mechanics suggests the possibility of\nreversing from determinacy to indeterminacy. What had been formerly\nregarded as determinate, the position and velocity of an object, was\nregarded as indeterminate by Werner Heisenberg. Quantum logicians,\nsuch as Hilary Putnam (1976), abandoned the distributive laws of\npropositional logic.\n\nPutnam (1983) went on propose a solution that seems to apply L. E. J.\nBrouwer\u2019s intuitionism to the sorites paradox. (In response to a\nrebuttal, Putnam [1985] surprisingly denied that intuitionistic\nsemantics was part of the proposal.) Brouwer had achieved fame with\nhis fixed point theorem. But reflection on Kant\u2019s philosophy of\nmathematics led Brouwer to retract his lovely proof. Any\nnon-constructive proof had to be replaced! Brouwer\u2019s recall of\nestablished theorems yielded more specific proofs that had higher\nexplanatory power. Theorems that could not be retrofitted became\nobjects of agnosticism. This was sad news for Brouwer\u2019s fixed\npoint theorem. But Putnam welcomes the recall of the\nepistemicist\u2019s theorem that there is a smallest natural number.\nThe classical logician relies on double negation to deduce a hidden\nboundary from the negation of the generalization \u201cIf \\(n\\) is\nsmall, then \\(n + 1\\) is small\u201d. Since the intuitionist does not\naccept this classical rule, his refusal to acquiesce to the induction\nstep does not saddle him with hidden thresholds. Like the\nepistemicist, the intuitionist treats vagueness as a cognitive problem\nthat does not require rejecting the law of bivalence. Unlike the\nepistemicist, the intuitionist must not claim to know the law of\nbivalence. To sustain this agnosticism about bivalence, the\nintuitionist must parry the sorites monger\u2019s reformulations\n(Wright 2021, chapter 14). For instance, the intuitionist\u2019s\nleast number principle threatens to re-ignite the sorites.\n\nMany commentators concede to the epistemicist that it is logically\npossible for vague predicates to have thresholds. They just think it\nwould be a miracle:\n\nIt is logically possible that the words on this page will come to life\nand sort my socks. But I know enough about words to dismiss this as a\nserious possibility. So I am right to boggle at the possibility that\nour rough and ready terms such as \u2018red\u2019 could so\nsensitively classify objects.\n\n\nEpistemicists counter that this bafflement rests on an over-estimate\nof stipulation\u2019s role in meaning. Epistemicists say much meaning\nis acquired passively by default rather than actively by decision. If\nsome boundaries are more eligible for reference than others, then the\nenvironment does the work. If nothing steps in to make a proposition\ntrue, then it is false. Or so opines Timothy Williamson.\n\nMost doubt whether precise analytical tools fit vague arguments. The\nscientific Romantic H. G. Wells was amongst the first to suggest that\nwe must moderate the application of logic:\n\nEvery species is vague, every term goes cloudy at its edges, and so in\nmy way of thinking, relentless logic is only another name for\nstupidity\u2014for a sort of intellectual pigheadedness. If you push\na philosophical or metaphysical enquiry through a series of valid\nsyllogisms\u2014never committing any generally recognised\nfallacy\u2014you nevertheless leave behind you at each step a certain\nrubbing and marginal loss of objective truth and you get deflections\nthat are difficult to trace at each phase in the process. Every\nspecies waggles about in its definition, every tool is a little loose\nin its handle, every scale has its individual error. (1908, 18)\n\n\nMany more believe that the problem is with logic itself rather than\nthe manner in which it is applied. They favor solving the sorites\nparadox by replacing standard logic with an earthier deviant\nlogic.\n\nThere is a desperately wide range of opinions as to how the revision\nof logic should be executed. Every form of deviant logic has been\napplied in the hope of resolving the sorites paradox.\n",
