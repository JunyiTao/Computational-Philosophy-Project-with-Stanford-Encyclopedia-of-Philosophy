    "main_text": "Diachronic Identity Puzzles || Temporary Identity\n4.6 Temporary Identity\n\nIn the case of, for example, the truncated cup we saw that one option\nis to claim that Cup is earlier distinct from Tcup [cup minus its\nhandle], but later identical with Tcup. According to this option the\nidentity of Cup with Tcup is only temporary. We also saw that many\nrefuse to countenance temporary identity because it allegedly\nconflicts with Leibniz's Law [LL]. After all, later Cup, but not Tcup,\napparently later has the property of having had a handle.\n\nDespite this putative conflict with LL, some philosophers are prepared\nto defend temporary identity as the best solution to the puzzles about\ndiachronic identity. George Myro does so by restricting the scope of\nLL to exclude such properties as having had a handle (Myro 1985).\nGallois (1998) does so by arguing that if the identity of Cup and Tcup\nis temporary, we cannot infer from Tcup having had a handle earlier\nthat earlier Tcup has a handle.\n",
