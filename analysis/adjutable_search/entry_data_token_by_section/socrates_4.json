    "main_text": "The Socratic problem: Who was Socrates really? || Implications for the philosophy of Socrates\n2.3 Implications for the philosophy of Socrates\n\nIt is a risky business to say where ancient philosophy is now, but an\nadvantage of an entry in a dynamic reference work is that authors are\nallowed, nay, encouraged to update their entries to reflect\nrecent scholarship and sea changes in their topics. For many analytic\nphilosophers, John Cooper (1997, xiv) sounded the end of the\ndevelopmentalist era when he described the early- and middle-period\ndialogue distinctions as \u201can unsuitable basis for bringing\nanyone to the reading of these works. To use them in that way is to\nannounce in advance the results of a certain interpretation of the\ndialogues and to canonize that interpretation under the guise of a\npresumably objective order of composition\u2014when in fact no such\norder is objectively known. And it thereby risks prejudicing\nan unwary reader against the fresh, individual reading that these\nworks demand.\u201d When he added, \u201cit is better to relegate\nthoughts about chronology to the secondary position they deserve and\nto concentrate on the literary and philosophical content of the works,\ntaken on their own and in relation to the others,\u201d he proposed\npeace between the literary contextualist and analytic developmentalist\ncamps. As in any peace agreement, it takes some time for all the\ncombatants to accept that the conflict has ended\u2014but that is\nwhere we are.\n\nIn short, one is now more free to answer, Who was Socrates really? in\nthe variety of ways that it has been answered in the past, in\none\u2019s own well-reasoned way, or to sidestep the question,\nphilosophizing about the issues in Plato\u2019s dialogues without\nworrying too much about the long toes of any particular interpretive\ntradition. Those seeking the views and methods of Plato\u2019s\nSocrates from the perspective of what one is likely to see attributed\nto him in the secondary literature (\u00a72.2) will find it useful to\nconsult the related entry on\n Plato\u2019s shorter ethical works.\n",
