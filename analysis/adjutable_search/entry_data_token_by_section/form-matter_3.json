    "main_text": "The principle of individuation\n4. Matter-involving forms\n\nAs we have seen, Aristotle introduces matter and form as contrasting\nnotions, distinct causes, which together make up every ordinary\nobject. It may come as a surprise, then, to find that he makes\ncomments which suggest that matter and form are more intimately\nintertwined than is obviously required by the manner of their\nintroduction. It is worth noting in this regard that he is eager to\ndistance himself from Plato\u2019s theory of Forms, which exist quite\napart from the material world. He does so in part by insisting that\nhis own forms are somehow enmeshed in matter (Metaphysics vi\n1 and vii 11, and De Anima i 1). He also maintains that all\nnatural forms are like something which is snub, where something is\nsnub only if it is concavity-realized-in-a-nose (Physics ii\n2; cf. Sophistical Refutations 13 and 31). The purport seems\nto be that all natural forms are such that they are themselves somehow\nmaterial beings, or at least that one must mention matter in their\nspecification. Consequently, some scholars have been inclined to\nsuppose that a thing\u2019s form itself contains a specification of\nthe matter which anything with that form has to have (see Balme 1984,\nCharles 2008, Peramatzis 2011). If so, rather than being contrasted\nwith matter, forms will be themselves somehow intrinsically material.\nOther scholars have been disinclined to draw this inference, not least\nbecause it seems to result in an unhappy conflation of the separate\nroles that matter and form are meant to play in Aristotle\u2019s\nmetaphysics (see Frede 1990).\n\nThe passage in the Metaphysics where Aristotle most obviously\naddresses this question is vii 11. He begins the chapter by asking\n\u201cwhat sorts of thing are parts of the form, and which are not,\nbut are parts of the compound\u201d (1036a26\u20137). He first\ndiscusses the case of things which are realized in multiple different\nsorts of matter: a circle may be realized in bronze or stone; so it is\nclear that its matter, bronze or stone, is not part of the form of the\ncircle, since it is separate from them (1036a33\u20134). We are then\ntold that, in the case of things which are not seen to be separate,\nnothing prevents the same considerations from applying to them,\n\u201ceven if all the circles that had been seen were bronze\u201d\n(1036b1).\n\nHaving considered the case of circles, Aristotle moves on to consider\nthe form of a man, and to ask of flesh and bones, \u201cAre these too\nparts of the form and definition?\u201d (1036b5). Some interpreters\nunderstand the next sentence to contain Aristotle\u2019s answer: \n\n\nIn truth no, they are the matter; but, because \u2039the\nform\u203a is not also in other \u2039sorts of matter\u203a, we\nare unable to separate them. (1036b5\u20137) \n\n\nRendered thus, the text suggests that, as in the circle case, flesh\nand bones are not part of the form of man. However, other editors,\nespecially those friendly to matter-involving forms, print this\nsentence as a question, so that it reads \n\n\nOr are they rather matter; but because \u2039the form\u203a is not\nalso in other \u2039sorts of matter\u203a, we are unable to\nseparate them? \n\n\nThis second way of understanding the sentence, though it does not\nrequire it, leaves open the possibility that Aristotle\u2019s answer\nwill be that, unlike in the circle case, flesh and bones are indeed\npart of the form of a man. Since punctuation marks are a later\ninvention, it is impossible to be certain which reading Aristotle\nintended. The sentence, as it stands, is inconclusive.\n\nWe might hope that Aristotle\u2019s view about whether flesh and\nbones are part of the form of man will become clearer later in the\nchapter. Unfortunately, the relevant passage is also open to multiple\ninterpretations. The chapter goes on to describe how \n\n\nsome people are in doubt even in the case of the circle and the\ntriangle, on the grounds that it is not right to define them in terms\nof lines and continuity, but that these too should all be spoken of in\nthe same way as flesh and bones of man and bronze and stone of statue.\n(1036b8\u201312) \n\n\nPresumably these thinkers object to lines and continuity being parts\nof the definitions of circle and triangle on the grounds that they are\nmatter, comparing them to other sorts of matter that are obviously\ninadmissible in definitions. Aristotle criticizes this line of\nthought, which suggests that maybe he does think that certain sorts of\nmatter or at least matter-like concepts are admissible in definitions.\nHowever, the fact that he groups flesh and bones with bronze and stone\nas the sort of matter that is obviously inadmissible suggests that he\ndoes not think that they are parts of the form of man.\n\nThe impression so far is seemingly contradicted a bit later, when we\nare told: \n\n\nAnd therefore to reduce everything in this way and to take away the\nmatter is futile: for surely some things are this \u2039form\u203a\nin this \u2039matter\u203a or these things is this state; and the\ncomparison in the case of animal, which Socrates the Younger used to\nmake, is not a good one; for it leads away from the truth, and makes\none think that it is possible for man to exist without his parts, as\nthe circle can without bronze. (1036b22\u20138) \n\n\nHere Aristotle would seem to be referring back to the earlier\ncomparison between the flesh and bones of a man and the bronze or\nstone of a statue at 1036b11, and claiming that the comparison\nmisleadingly suggests that flesh and bones are not part of the form of\na man, when in fact they are.\n\nThat anyway is how those in favour of matter-involving forms take this\npassage, but there is another possible reading. Instead of failing to\nrealize that human beings, unlike circles, are essentially realized in\nflesh and bones, and as such these must be included in their form,\nSocrates the Younger\u2019s mistake might have been his paying\ninsufficient attention to the fact that circles, being mathematical\nobjects, need not be instantiated in any specific kind of matter at\nall, whereas human beings always are. If this is the mistake that\nAristotle is identifying, this passage would not support any sort of\nmatter-involving forms, but only the view that natural forms, like the\nform of a man, are always instantiated in matter of certain sorts.\nEven if the forms were necessarily so instantiated, this would not\nrequire that the matter be included in the specification of the\nthing\u2019s form.\n\nThere are other texts, which have been used to argue directly for the\nview that Aristotle embraces matter-involving forms: De Anima\ni 1, where Aristotle describes anger as desire for retaliation\nmanifested in boiling of the blood around the heart; or\nPhysics ii 2, where he says that natural forms are analogous\nto snubness, i.e., concavity realized in a nose. Defenders of pure\nforms can attempt to deal with these passages by distinguishing\nbetween a pure form, and a broader \u201cdefinition\u201d\n(logos, horos, horismos) which brings in\nother causes.\n\nAs well as purely textual arguments, several more philosophical\nmotivations have been proffered in favour of matter-involving forms.\nOne such argument relies on the fact that natural things, unlike\nmathematical ones, are subject to change. Only things with matter are\ncapable of change, and, if natural forms are to account for the\ncharacteristic changes undergone by natural compounds, the claim is\nthat they must themselves be matter-involving. For example, the\nproperty of falling downwards when unsupported is one had by all human\nbeings. Aristotle would explain this propensity as being due to their\nbeing made of a preponderance of the heavier elements, earth and\nwater. If the form of a human being is to account for this fact,\nplausibly it will have to make mention of the material constitution of\nhuman beings that results in this sort of characteristic\nbehaviour.\n\nIn assessing this argument, a lot seems to depend on how extensive an\nexplanatory role can be assigned to hypothetical necessity (cf.\nPhysics ii 9). All human beings have a tendency to fall,\nnecessarily, at least in a world with laws of physics like ours.\nHowever, it is not so clear whether this characteristic sort of change\nis one which must be explained by the form or essence of a human\nbeing, as opposed to his matter. After all, there are lots of other\nsorts of thing, both living and inanimate, which share this particular\ncharacteristic. Supposing there was a characteristic sort of change\npeculiar to all and only human beings, even then it is not obvious (a)\nthat this fact has to be explained by the essence of a human being,\nand (b) that its explanation will require the essence to be\nmatter-involving. To be sure, we would like some explanation of why\nthis sort of change is peculiar to this sort of creature, but it might\nsimply be a fact about the world that anything with an essence of this\nsort has to change in this sort of way, without that change being\nsomething that is specified within the essence itself.\n\nIn this connection it is important to notice that Aristotle recognizes\nthe existence of idia, that is of properties that apply to\nall and only instances of a given species, which an instance of that\nspecies has necessarily, but which are not part of its essence: e.g.,\nall and only human beings are capable of laughter (cf.\nCategories 5, 3a21, 4a10; Topics i 5,\n102a18\u201330, and v 5, 134a5\u2013135b6). The essence of a human\nbeing is rationality, and the fact that we all (apparently) have a\nsense of humour follows from the essence together with how the world\nis. Many characteristic changes of organisms may be best explained in\na similar way: all ducks waddle, but waddling is not part of their\nfunction. Rather anything that fulfils the functional requirements of\na duck must (in a world like ours) walk inelegantly.\n\nThe question of whether or not Aristotelian forms are\n\u201cessentially matter-involving\u201d is further complicated by\nsome unclarity about what this description precisely amounts to. In\nparticular, it is unclear whether it is supposed to be a thing\u2019s\nform, which is also its essence, which is matter-involving, or the\nessence of the form (or both). Aristotle identifies a thing\u2019s\nform with its essence at Metaphysics vii 7, 1032b1\u20132:\n\u201cby form I mean the essence of each thing and\n\u2039its\u203a primary substance\u201d. (He makes the same\nidentity claim at vii 10, 1035b32, cf. also viii 4, 1044a36.) With\nthis in mind, we can divide the possible views about matter-involving\nforms into the following four positions, with ascending degrees of\nmatter-involvement:\n\nPure forms: natural compounds (and their forms) have forms or\nessences that are not matter-involving.\nCompounds have forms or essences that involve matter, i.e., matter\nis part of the compound\u2019s essence or form. The form that is part\nof the compound\u2019s form, however, itself has a further\nform or essence that is not matter-involving.\nAs in (2), compounds have forms or essences that involve matter;\nbut forms themselves have no essences or forms.\nAs in (2) and (3), compounds have forms or essences that involve\nmatter; and so do forms, i.e., not only are the forms or essences of\ncompounds themselves in some sense compounds of matter and form, as in\n(2) and (3), but they themselves have further essences or\nforms that are compounds of matter and form.\n\n\nA serious objection to position (4) is that it apparently leads to a\nvicious infinite regress: if a compound\u2019s essence or form is\nitself a compound of matter and form, and this second form has an\nessence or form which is also a hylomorphic compound, etc., every\ncompound will have an infinite series of essences or forms associated\nwith it. Socrates is (essentially) a compound of matter and form, so\nis his form, so is its form, etc. Note that this regress only applies\nif all forms are held to be matter-involving. It does not afflict the\nmore moderate matter-involving position, (2), since it holds that the\nform of the compound is matter-involving, and hence has both material\nand formal parts, but that this second form, the form of the form, is\npure, and has itself as a form, e.g., the form of a computer may be\ncomputing functions in certain suitable matter, but the formal part of\nthat form (computing functions) would be pure. The regress is not\nmerely unattractively bloated and otiose. If a full explanation of\nwhat something is requires one to list an infinite series of forms,\nsuch explanations will not be viable for finite beings like us.\n\nA different way to avoid the regress which plagues (4) would be to\ndeny the assumption that anything that is matter-involving must be a\ncompound of matter and form. Form is matter-involving, but that is not\nto say that it has its own form or essence and its own matter. Form\nand matter are introduced to explain certain facts about ordinary\nobjects of perception, such as this man or this horse. Once those\nfacts have been accounted for, there is no need to look for the same\nexplanations of the theoretical entities which have been introduced to\nprovide the original explanation. This way out of the regress involves\ndenying that forms have essences, i.e., it reverts to position (3).\nThis position faces a number of textual obstacles. For instance, at\nthe beginning of De Anima i 1, Aristotle announces that\n\u201cour aim is to grasp and understand [the soul\u2019s] nature\nand essence, and secondly its properties\u201d (402a7\u20138). In\nMetaphysics vii 11, he refers to the account (logos)\nof the essence (1037a22\u20133), and claims that \u201cthe account\nof the soul is [the account] of the man\u201d (1037a28\u20139) (cf.\nalso Physics ii 2, 194a13). For these textual reasons it\nwould be preferable for a proponent of (3) to be able to say that\nforms do have essences or definitions in a sense, but they are\nidentical with these (as snubness = concavity in a nose). Their\nessences are not some further thing, distinct from them.\n\nThe difficulty with this is that it is not clear that the defender of\n(3) can claim that forms have definitions of any sort and still\nmaintain a doctrine that is distinct from both (2), on the one hand,\nand (4) on the other. Given that forms are definitions, they must have\na structure that approximates to that of a linguistic entity. Whatever\nelse one says about them then, it seems clear that they must be\ndivisible (in thought) into component parts, as complex predicates are\ndivisible into words. We may ask of these component parts whether or\nnot they are matter-involving, i.e., the question which the proponent\nof (3) answers in the affirmative with respect to the form or essence\nof the compound\u2014does it have parts which correspond to material\nterms like \u201cflesh\u201d or \u201chand\u201d or\n\u201cmatter\u201d? If some parts of the form\u2019s definition are\nmatter-involving, and others are not, this seems to make the\ndefinition in some sense a compound of material and formal parts. We\ncan then identify the formal parts, and ask if there is a definition\nof them, and, if the answer is \u201cyes, a matter-involving\none\u201d, we are stuck once again with the regress which afflicted\n(4). On the other hand, if no part of the form\u2019s definition is\nmatter-involving, the proponent of (3) must hold that, while compounds\nhave essences which are matter-involving, these essences have\ndefinitions which are not, and this seems to make his view intolerably\nsimilar to (2).\n\nIt might seem as though it does not make much difference whether\nAristotle subscribes to position (1) or (2). According to (2), every\nphysical object has two forms associated with it: a matter-involving\none, which combines with the proximate matter to make up the compound,\nand a second form or essence of this matter-involving form, which is\nnot matter-involving. On position (1), a thing has only one form,\nwhich is \u201cpure\u201d in the sense that it contains no matter.\nHowever, the defender of pure forms must admit that there is also a\nbroader definition of a thing, which does include its matter, as well\nas its other causes. Superficially, the only difference seems to be\nwhether or not this \u201cdefinition\u201d gets to be classified as\na form, and this might appear to be a merely verbal disagreement. In\nfact, more is at stake here: although, \u201cdefinition\u201d,\n\u201cform\u201d and \u201cessence\u201d are often treated as\nthough they were interchangeable, a definition is strictly-speaking\nsomething linguistic, whereas an essence or form may have a structure\nthat corresponds to something linguistic, but it is still a thing in\nthe world. For example, the essence or form of a human being is a\nsoul. A commitment to two essences or forms per compound substance is\nan additional metaphysical commitment in a way that a broader\nlinguistic definition of a thing that mentions both its form and its\nmatter need not be. If important theoretical work cannot be found for\nmatter-involving forms, then, pure forms are the more ontologically\nparsimonious choice.\n\nIn any event, one can see that Aristotle\u2019s initial contrast\nbetween matter and form grows quickly complex once hylomorphism leaves\nthe domain of change. Although introduced as contrastive notions\nsuited to explicate change and substantial generation in the absence\nof generation ex nihilo, any easy contrast between form and\nmatter turns out to be difficult to sustain once it finds employment\nin its further applications. Even so, as Aristotle implies, and as\nmany of his followers have affirmed, hylomorphism proves no less\nelastic than explanatorily powerful across a wide range of explanatory\nroles.\n",
