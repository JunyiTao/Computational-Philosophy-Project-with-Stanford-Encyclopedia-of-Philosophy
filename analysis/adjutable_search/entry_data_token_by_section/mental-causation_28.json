    "main_text": "Problem IV: Externalism || The Appeal to Explanatory Practice\n8. Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Mind\n\nWe have been treating the problem of mental causation as though it\nwere a problem in applied metaphysics. Perhaps this approach is\nwrong-headed. Perhaps the problem really falls under the purview of\nthe philosophy of science. What if we began with a look at actual\nscientific practice (as suggested in \u00a7\u00a76.3, 7.5) and\ndetermined what exactly science requires for acceptable causal\nexplanation? An examination of established special sciences reveals\nthat the very features (multiple realizability, higher-level and\n\u201cbroad\u201d properties, for instance) metaphysically inclined\nphilosophers regard as posing apparently insuperable difficulties for\nmental causation, are routinely invoked in causal explanations in\nthose sciences. This suggests that, rather than let a priori\nconceptions of causation (or properties, or causal powers) lead us to\nregard mental causation with suspicion, we should reason in the other\ndirection: revise our conception of causation to fit our actual\nscientific beliefs and practices. If the metaphysicians were right\nabout causation, no science would be possible beyond basic physics\n(biological properties, for instance, would lack causal efficacy).\n\nThis is one way to go. Another way is to take a step backward and ask\nwhich features of our conception of the mental, features we commonly\ntake for granted, might be the source of our difficulties.\nEliminativists aside, all parties evidently agree that \u201crealism\nabout the mental\u201d requires that mental predicates figuring in\ncausal accounts of behavior designate distinctively mental properties.\nIf we aim to honor psychology (and the other special sciences), our\njob is to show how these properties could be causally relevant to\nphysical goings-on. Suppose, in contrast, that you took the goal to\nbe, not the preservation of mental properties, but the\npreservation of mental truths. In that case we would seek an\naccount of the mind that provides plausible truthmakers for\npsychological and psycho-physical claims, including claims concerning\nmental causation.\n\nOne possibility is that truthmakers for psychological truths include\nirreducibly mental properties. This is not the only possibility,\nhowever. Another is that psychological assertions are made true by\nphysical states and properties, states and properties answering to\npredicates belonging to physics and chemistry. A view of this kind\n(which is close to Davidson\u2019s as spelled out in \u00a75 and to\nthe identity solutions discussed in \u00a76.5) would endeavor to\nresolve the problem of mental causation, not by tinkering with the\ncausal concept, but by rejecting the idea that mental and physical\nproperties are distinct kinds of property. All parties agree that\nmental predicates and descriptions differ from physical predicates and\ndescriptions. Application conditions for mental terms and physical\nterms diverge in ways that preclude definitional reduction of the one\nto the other. Perhaps it is a mistake, however, to move from this\nlinguistic fact to a substantive ontological thesis: mental and\nphysical predicates designate properties belonging to distinct\nfamilies of properties.\n\nWhether anything like this could be made to work is an open question.\nTo the extent that you regard the current state of play as\nunsatisfying, however, it is perhaps a question worth pursuing.\n",
