    "main_text": "\n\nJos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset (1883\u20131955) was a prolific and\ndistinguished Spanish philosopher in the twentieth century. In the\ncourse of his career as philosopher, social theorist, essayist,\ncultural and aesthetic critic, educator, politician and editor of the\ninfluential journal, Revista de Occidente, he has written on\na broad range of themes and issues. Among his many books are:\nMeditations on Quixote (1914), Invertebrate Spain\n(1921), The Theme of Our Time (1923), Ideas on the\nNovel (1925), The Dehumanization of Art (1925), What\nis Philosophy? (1929), The Revolt of the Masses (1930),\nEn Torno a Galileo [Man and Crisis] (1933),\nHistory as a System (1935), Man and People\n(1939\u201340), The Origin of Philosophy (1943), The\nIdea of Principle in Leibnitz and the Evolution of Deductive\nTheory (1948). In addition to these books, he also wrote hundreds\nof essays and newspaper and magazine articles, the most important of\nwhich are collected in twelve volumes, several of which have been\ntranslated into English, French and German. His major writings reveal\nan intellectual development that traversed the life-world experiences\narticulated in the perspectives of phenomenology, historicism and\nexistentialism.\n\nOrtega\u2019s perception of human life as fundamental reality and as a\n\u201chappening\u201d, his analysis of the ontological distinction\nbetween \u201cbeing\u201d and \u201cauthentic being\u201d, his\ndescription of the intersubjective interaction of the \u201cI\u201d\nand \u201cOthers\u201d in the social world, his concepts of\n\u201cgeneration\u201d, \u201ccontemporaries\u201d and\n\u201cco-evals\u201d, and his ideas of \u201cperspectivism\u201d,\n\u201cvital\u201d and \u201chistorical reason\u201d, all combine\nto broaden and advance his philosophy of human social and historical\nrealities. Through these intellectual orientations, Ortega became\nconcerned with the epistemological status of historical knowledge, and\napproached the critical philosophy of history as the interpenetration\nof philosophical and historical attitudes. Critical philosophy of\nhistory thus refers to the position that characterizes the world we\nknow and in which we act as a product of human activity and mind.\nAccordingly, Ortega represented the \u201cmodern\u201d reflective\nthinker who approached history from philosophy, and whose theories of\nhistory as a source of human knowledge have epitomized the tendency to\nconnect concepts of historical temporality and mind. He challenged\npositivist approaches to history and contributed an important aspect\nto the modern concept of history: the tenet that there is connection\nand meaning in human history which emanates from a principle of\ncontinuity inherent in individual human lives.\n",
