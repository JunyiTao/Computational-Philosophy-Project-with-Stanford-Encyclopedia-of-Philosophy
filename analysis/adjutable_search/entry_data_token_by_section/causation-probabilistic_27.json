    "main_text": "Actual Causation || . Fenton-Glynn\u2019s Causal Modeling Account\n4.5 Conclusion and Further Reading\n\nWhile this section describes some success stories, it is safe to say\nthat no analysis of actual causation is widely believed to perfectly\ncapture all of our pre-theoretic intuitions about hypothetical cases.\nIndeed, it is not clear that these intuitions form a coherent set, or\nthat they are perfectly tracking objective features of the world.\nGlymour et al. (2010) raise a number of challenges to the general\nproject of trying to provide an analysis of actual causation.\n\nThe anthologies Collins et al. 2004 and Dowe & Noordhof 2004\ncontain a number of essays on topics related to the discussion of this\nsection. Hitchcock 2004b has an extended discussion of the problem\nposed by fizzlers. Hitchcock 2015 is an overview of Lewis\u2019s work\non causation. The entry for\n counterfactual theories of causation\n discusses Lewis\u2019s work, and counterfactual theories of\ncausation more generally. \n",
