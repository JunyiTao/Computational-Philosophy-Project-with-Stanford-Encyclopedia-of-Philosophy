Locke on Persons and Personal Identity: The Basics\n\nLocke\u2019s most thorough discussion of the persistence (or\ndiachronic identity) of persons can be found in Book 2, Chapter 27 of\nthe Essay (\u201cOf Identity and Diversity\u201d), though\nLocke anticipates this discussion as early as Book 1, Chapter 4,\nSection 5, and Locke refers to persons in other texts, including the\nSecond Treatise of Government. The discussion of persons and\ntheir persistence conditions also features prominently in\nLocke\u2019s lengthy exchange with Edward Stillingfleet, Bishop of\nWorcester (1697\u20131699).\n\nLocke begins \u201cOf Identity and Diversity\u201d by first getting\nclear on the principle of individuation, and by setting out what some\nhave called the place-time-kind principle\u2014which stipulates that\nno two things of the same kind can be in the same place at the same\ntime, and no individual can be in two different places at the same\ntime (L-N\n 2.27.1).[2]\n With some of the basics of identity in place, Locke posits that\nbefore we can determine the persistence conditions for atoms, masses\nof matter, plants, animals, men, or persons, we must first know what\nwe mean by these terms. In other words, before we can determine what\nmakes atoms, masses of matter, plants, animals, men, or persons the\nsame over time, we must pin down the nominal essences\u2014or general\nideas\u2014for these kinds. Of this Locke says, \n\n\n\u2019Tis not therefore Unity of Substance that comprehends all sorts\nof Identity, or will determine it in every Case: But to\nconceive, and judge of it aright, we must consider what Idea\nthe Word it is applied to stands for\u2026. (L-N 2.27.7)\n\n\nThat we must define a kind term before determining the persistence\nconditions for that kind is underscored in Locke\u2019s definition of\n\u201cperson\u201d. Locke starts off by saying, \n\n\nThis being premised to find wherein personal Identity\nconsists, we must consider what Person stands for\u2026.\n\n\n\nHe goes on, \n\n\nwhich, I think, is a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and\nreflection, and can consider it self as itself, the same thinking\nthing in different times and places\u2026. (L-N 2.27.9) \n\n\nA person for Locke is thus the kind of entity that can think self\nreflectively, and think of itself as persisting over time. \n\nLocke additionally asserts that persons are agents. For Locke\n\u201cperson\u201d is a \n\n\n\u2026Forensick Term appropriating Actions and their Merit; and so\nbelongs only to intelligent Agents capable of a Law, and Happiness and\nMisery. (L-N 2.27.26) \n\n\nPersons are therefore not just thinking intelligent beings that can\nreason and reflect, and consider themselves as the same thinking\nthings in different times and places, but also entities that can be\nheld accountable for their actions. It is because persons can\nthink of themselves as persisting over time that they can, and do,\nplan ahead, with an eye toward the punishment or reward that may\nfollow.\n\nJust after Locke defines \u201cperson\u201d, he begins to elucidate\nwhat makes any person the same person over time. He asserts that \n\n\n\u2026consciousness always accompanies thinking, and \u2018tis\nthat, that makes every one to be, what he calls self. (L-N\n2.27.9) \n\n\nConsciousness is what distinguishes selves, and thus, \n\n\n\u2026in this alone consists personal Identity, i.e. the\nsameness of rational Being: And as far as this consciousness can be\nextended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the\nIdentity of that Person; it is the same self now it\nwas then; and \u2018tis by the same self with this present\none that now reflects on it, that that Action was done. (L-N 2.27.9)\n\n\n\nAfter the initial assertion that the diachronic identity of persons\nconsists in sameness of consciousness, Locke goes on to use various\nimaginary cases to drive this point home.\n\nThe imaginary cases that Locke employs are not dissimilar to ancient\ncases, such as the Ship of Theseus, reported by Plutarch. In this\ncase, we are asked to imagine a ship that has slowly had its planks\nreplaced with new ones. The intuition Plutarch\u2019s case is\nintended to test is whether, at the end (when the ship has an entirely\nnew material constitution), we have the same ship as before. Likewise,\nLocke is using cases to test readers\u2019 intuitions about\npersistence and identity. But it is arguable that Locke is the first\nto devise such cases to specifically test readers\u2019 intuitions\nabout persons and the conditions under which they are the\nsame. Locke is thus carving out a new conceptual space through such\nimaginary cases. A few of these will be outlined and discussed in what\nfollows. \n\nIn the \u201cprince and the cobbler\u201d passage, or L-N 2.27.15,\nLocke asks the reader to imagine the soul of a prince entering and\ninforming the body of a cobbler, taking all of its \u201cprincely\nthoughts\u201d with it. In this scenario, the person called\n\u201cprince\u201d ends up persisting in the man identified as the\n\u201ccobbler\u201d, because the prince\u2019s consciousness goes\nalong with the prince\u2019s soul. Just after Locke describes this\nscenario, he says, \n\n\nI know that in the ordinary way of speaking, the same Person, and the\nsame Man, stand for one and the same thing. And indeed every one will\nalways have a liberty to speak, as he pleases, and to apply what\narticulate Sounds to what Ideas he thinks fit, and change\nthem as often as he pleases. But yet when we will enquire, what makes\nthe same Spirit, Man, or Person, in our Minds; and\nhaving resolved with our selves what we mean by them, it will not be\nhard to determine, in either of them, or the like, when it is the\nsame, and when not. (L-N 2.27.15)\n\n\nThrough the \u201cprince and the cobbler\u201d passage it not only\nbecomes clear that a person goes where their consciousness goes, but\nalso that Locke distinguishes between the term \u201cman\u201d\n(which is synonymous with \u201chuman being\u201d) and\n\u201cperson\u201d.\n\nOther scenarios that Locke conjures, such as the \u201cwaking and\nsleeping Socrates\u201d case (L-N 2.27.19), make clear that even if\nan individual remains the same man, he may not persist as the same\nperson. Here Locke says,\n\n\nIf the same Socrates waking and sleeping do not partake of\nthe same consciousness, Socrates waking and sleeping\nis not the same Person. And to punish Socrates waking, for\nwhat sleeping Socrates thought, and waking Socrates\nwas never conscious of, would be no more of Right, than to punish one\nTwin for what his Brother-Twin did, whereof he knew nothing, because\ntheir outsides were so like, that they could not be distinguished; for\nsuch Twins have been seen. (L-N 2.27.19)\n\n\nIf Socrates has a different consciousness by day than he does by\nnight, then waking Socrates ought not be punished for what sleeping\nSocrates does. This is because although Socrates is the same man by\nday as he is by night, he is a different person by day than he is at\nnight (and moral responsibility lies with persons, according to\nLocke). Thus while the identity of consciousness determines the\nidentity of person, the identity of persons and the identity of men\ncome apart for Locke\u2014or at least they\n can.[3]\n\n\nLocke additionally distinguishes between persons and souls. There is\nevidence for this in L-N 2.27.13. Here Locke claims, \n\n\nBut yet to return to the Question before us, it must be allowed, That\nif the same consciousness \u2026 can be transferr\u2019d from one\nthinking Substance to another, it will be possible, that two thinking\nSubstances may make but one Person. \n\n\nIf consciousness can actually be transferred from one soul to another,\nthen a person can persist, despite a change in the soul to which her\nconsciousness is annexed. Thus if a reader\u2019s soul switches out\nas she progresses from the start of L-N 2.27 to the end, so long as\nthe reader\u2019s consciousness remains the same, she remains the\nsame person, according to Locke.\n\nOn top of this, Locke asserts that even if an individual has the same\nsoul, he may fail to be the same person. Locke makes this point in L-N\n2.27.14, 23, and 24. In the \u201cday and night-man\u201d passage,\nor 2.27.23, Locke asks the reader to imagine \u201c\u2026two\ndistinct incommunicable consciousnesses acting the same Body, the one\nconstantly by Day, the other by Night\u201d (L-N 2.27.23). Locke goes\non to suggest that the \u201c\u2026Day and the\nNight-man\u201d are \u201cas distinct persons as\nSocrates and Plato\u201d (L-N 2.27.23). Locke then\nmakes clear that this is the case even if day and night-man share the\nsame soul:\n\n\nFor granting that the thinking Substance in Man must be necessarily\nsuppos\u2019d immaterial, \u2018tis evident, that immaterial\nthinking thing may sometimes part with its past consciousness, and be\nrestored to it again, as appears in the forgetfulness Men often have\nof their past Actions, and the Mind many times recovers the memory of\na past consciousness, which it had lost for twenty Years together.\nMake these intervals of Memory and Forgetfulness to take their turns\nregularly by Day and Night, and you have two Persons with the same\nimmaterial Spirit, as much as in the former instance two Persons with\nthe same Body. So that self is not determined by Identity or\nDiversity of Substance\u2026but only by identity of consciousness.\n(L-N 2.27.23) \n\n\nJust as the \u201cwaking and sleeping Socrates\u201d passage, L-N\n2.27.23 shows that there can be a change of person due to a change in\nconsciousness, and this is the case even though there is no change in\nman. But, what Locke also makes clear through L-N 2.27.23 is that\nthere can be a change of person even though there is no change in\nsoul. Thus while many philosophers (including Plato, Rene Descartes,\nSamuel Clarke, etc.) think that one cannot be a person unless one has\nan immaterial soul, and the identity of persons rests in the identity\nof souls, Locke makes the bold move of pulling persons and souls\napart.\n\nIn addition to this, Locke calls the substantial nature of souls into\nquestion. Locke takes thought to be immaterial, and while Locke\ncontends that the immaterial cannot be reduced to, or explained in\nterms of, the material, Locke is not committed to substance dualism,\nwhen it comes to finite thinkers. This is because Locke thinks\nsubstratum\u2014or the substance that underlies and supports any\nparticular substance\u2019s qualities\u2014is impossible for finite\nminds to penetrate. Additionally there is nothing in the concepts\n\u201cthought\u201d and \u201cmatter\u201d that allows us to\ndeduce that one excludes the other, and God could have superadded the\nability to think to formerly inert systems of matter. In Locke\u2019s\npicture, we cannot know whether the substance (or substratum) that\nunderlies thinking and willing is different from the substance (or\nsubstratum) that underlies being solid and white, or yellow and\nmalleable. Locke\u2019s official position on the substantial nature\nof finite thinkers is therefore one of agnosticism.\n2. Locke on Persons: What\u2019s Up for Debate\n\nThis section outlines some of the areas of Locke\u2019s text, and\naspects of Locke\u2019s view, that continue to be debated by\nhistorians of philosophy working to make sense of Locke\u2019s\npicture of persons and their persistence conditions today. As will\nsoon become clear, there is disagreement about almost every\naspect of Locke\u2019s discussion of persons, and even some of\nwhat has been presented thus far betrays a particular interpretive\nframework.\n\nOne of the overarching questions asked about Locke\u2019s\nEssay is how much it includes metaphysical exploration. Some\nthink that Locke\u2019s project is exclusively\nepistemological, citing (among other passages) the following as\nevidence for their view: In the Epistle to the Reader, Locke\ndescribes himself as an \u201cunderlabourer\u201d. Locke then goes\non to say,\n\n\nThis, therefore being my Purpose to enquire into the\nOriginal, Certainty, and Extent of humane Knowledge; together, with\nthe Grounds and Degrees of Belief, Opinion, and Assent; I shall not at\npresent meddle with the Physical Consideration of the Mind; or trouble\nmy self to examine, wherein its Essence consists, or by what Motions\nof our Spirits, or Alterations of our Bodies, we come to have any\nSensation by our Organs, or any Ideas in our Understandings;\nand whether those Ideas do in their Formation, any, or all of\nthem, depend on Matter, or no. These are Speculations, which, however\ncurious and entertaining, I shall decline, as lying out of my Way, in\nthe Design I am now upon. (L-N 1.1.2) \n\n\nUnder this reading, Locke is interested in determining what we can and\ncannot know by first determining how we come to have ideas, but what\nthis entails is determining which activities give rise to our ideas,\nrather than investigating the metaphysical nature of the thinking\nthing wherein these activities\u2014sensation and\nreflection\u2014take place. Likewise all other explorations within\nthe Essay eschew metaphysics.\n\nThose who read L-N 2.27 as part of a project which is purely\nepistemological see the claims that Locke makes about the persistence\nof persons as claims about what we can know about the\npersistence of persons. As Lex Newman puts it, \n\n\nLocke\u2019s broader aim is to clarify the conditions under which we\njudge that we are numerically the same with some earlier\nperson, not the conditions under which we strictly are the\nsame person. (2015: 90) \n\n\nUnder this kind of reading, Locke\u2019s claim that the identity of\nany person does not rest in the identity of substance (L-N 2.27.10 and\n23) amounts to the claim that if any person wants to determine whether\nthey are the same, they do not look to substance to find out. The idea\nis that because we have such an impoverished notion of substance in\ngeneral, we do not look to substratum to determine if we are the same\nperson over time in Locke\u2019s view.\n\nOther scholars tend to think that although Locke sets his task in the\nEssay as an epistemological one, he cannot help but dabble in\nsome metaphysics along the way. What has been presented (regarding the\nbasics of Locke\u2019s picture of persons) in this entry thus far\nfalls within this interpretive camp. This is why the imaginary cases\nthat Locke employs in L-N 2.27 have been described as giving the\nreader information about what makes it the case that a person\nis the same at time 2 as at time 1. According to this view, what Locke\nis giving us in L-N 2.27 are inter alia \u201cthe conditions\nunder which we strictly are the same person\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, within the interpretive camp that takes Locke to dabble\nin metaphysics, there is widespread debate, both at the macro and the\nmicro level. To start with the macro level: Some who fall into this\ncamp see Locke making metaphysical claims in various passages\nthroughout the text. Such scholars thus see what Locke is\ndoing in L-N 2.27 as very much in keeping with moves that he makes in\nother parts of the Essay (see Stuart 2013, for example).\nHowever, others see L-N 2.27\u2014and the metaphysics Locke is doing\ntherein\u2014as a significant break from the methodology\nthat Locke employs in the rest of the Essay. This is because\njust after Locke claims that his project in the Essay is an\nepistemological one (1.1.2), he makes clear that in this project, he\nis using the historical plain method, or roughly, the Baconian method\nof induction (see Nuovo forthcoming). Of this, Locke says,\n\n\n\u2026I shall imagine I have not wholly misimploy\u2019d my self in\nthe Thoughts I shall have on this Occasion, if, in this Historical,\nplain Method, I can give any Account of the Ways , whereby our\nUnderstandings come to attain those Notions of Things we have, and can\nset down any Measures of the Certainty of our Knowledge, or the\nGrounds of those perswasions, which are to be found amongst Men, so\nvarious, different, and wholly contradictory\u2026. (L-N 1.1.2) \n\n\nThose who see a tension between Locke\u2019s discussion of personal\nidentity and the rest of the Essay contend that the way in\nwhich Locke proceeds in L-N 2.27 not only includes metaphysics, but\nalso a reliance on thought experiments for data. Thus, rather than\nsurveying a number of instances, and drawing inferences from\nthere\u2014or utilizing the historical, plain method\u2014as he\nclaims to be doing throughout the Essay, Locke is doing\nsomething quite different in 2.27: He is employing imaginary cases\ninstead (see Antonia LoLordo 2012, for example).\n\nHowever, what the historical plain method amounts to for Locke, and\nwhether Locke\u2019s use of thought experiments in L-N 2.27 is in\ntension with this method is also the subject of debate. So too is\nwhether Locke uses thought experiments in 2.27 alone.\nAdditionally, some have questioned whether the exercises that Locke\nwalks readers through in 2.27 count as thought experiments at all (see\nKathryn Tabb 2018, for more on this). There are thus wide-ranging\ndebates about how to best describe 2.27 and the methodologies Locke\nemploys therein. There is also much disagreement regarding how to\nsquare these methodologies with the general description Locke gives of\nhis project in the Essay. Moreover, this is the case even\namongst those who are in agreement that Locke is doing\nmetaphysics in 2.27.\n\nOn top of this, there are deep and long-standing micro-level debates\namongst those who think Locke is giving us some metaphysics in L-N\n2.27. One such debate regards the implications of Locke\u2019s\nassertion that the identity of any person does not rest in the\nidentity of substance (2.27.10 and 23). Some scholars take\nLocke\u2019s assertion that the identity of any person does not rest\nin the identity of substance, and other similar claims, to be evidence\nthat Locke is a relativist about identity (see Stuart 2013, for\nexample). To get a sense of what this entails, it is helpful to\nconsider the contrast case: strict identity. If a philosopher holds a\nstrict identity theory, then she takes it that we can ask, \u201cIs\ny at time 2 the same as x at time 1?\u201d and arrive\nat a determinate answer. On the other hand, if a philosopher is a\nrelativist about identity, then she asserts that in response to the\nformer question, we have to ask \u201cSame what?\u201d So if we ask,\n\u201cIs Socrates the same?\u201d a relativist about identity thinks\nwe have to specify under which sortal term we are considering\nSocrates. Are we thinking about Socrates as a human being, or a body,\nor a soul (or something else altogether)?\n\nOn top of this, the relativist about identity thinks that an entity\nwho is of two sorts can persist according to one, while failing to\npersist according to the other. We might say that from one day to the\nnext, Socrates persists as the same human being, but not as the same\nbody. Thus when Locke says that a person can persist despite a change\nin substance, or a person can persist despite a change in soul, some\nscholars take Locke to be showing that he is a relativist about\nidentity. Relative identity readings were rather unpopular for some\ntime, but have experienced a resurgence as of late (see Stuart\n2013).\n\nStill, some think that attributing this kind of reading to Locke is\nanachronistic. Others take issue with the fact that under a relative\nidentity reading, there is, properly speaking, just one entity\ndescribed under different sorts. (What we call \u201cSocrates\u201d\ndoes not pick out a human being, and person, with a body and soul, but\nrather one thing, described in these different ways.) This is\nappealing for some, especially those who think that this is the only\nway to save Locke from violating the place-time-kind principle, which\nstipulates that no two things of the same kind can be in the same\nplace at the same time. But it lacks appeal for those who take Locke\nto be claiming that persons and the human beings who house them (for\ninstance) are\n distinct.[4]\n\nSome scholars take Locke\u2019s assertion that the identity of\nsubstance is neither required nor enough for the persistence of any\nperson to be evidence that persons are modes (or attributes), rather\nthan substances (or things themselves). Such scholars then turn to\nLocke\u2019s place-time-kind principle, for further evidence for\ntheir view. They take Locke\u2019s assertion that no two things of\nthe same kind can be in the same place at the same time to mean that\nno two substances of the same kind can be in the same place\nat the same time. Souls are thinking substances for Locke, and if\npersons are substances, they would count as such. Thus, persons cannot\nbe substances, for otherwise wherever there is a person and her soul\nthere are two thinking substances in the same place at the same time.\nThose who offer mode readings additionally turn to Locke\u2019s claim\nthat person is a \u201cforensic term\u201d and Locke\u2019s bold\nassertion that a demonstrative science of morality is possible as\nevidence that the term \u201cperson\u201d must be a mode term,\nrather than a substance term. This line of interpretation is popular\ntoday (see LoLordo 2012, Mattern 1980, Uzgalis 1990), but dates back\nto Edmund Law (1769).\n\nOther Locke scholars defend substance readings of Locke on persons.\nThey turn to Locke\u2019s claims about substance, power, and agency,\nto conclude that if an entity has any power whatsoever it has to be a\nsubstance. Persons have powers. Thus, persons have to be substances\nfor Locke (for arguments along these lines, see Gordon-Roth 2015,\nRickless 2015, Chappell 1990). They then have to explain what Locke\nmeans when he asserts that the identity of any person does not rest in\nthe identity of substance. Those who do not take the relative identity\npath usually end up working to get clear on what Locke could mean by\n\u201csubstance\u201d when he makes this claim. Many conclude that\nwhat Locke means is that the identity of any person does not depend\nupon the identity of the simple substances that compose or constitute\nher. There are numerous defenders of this position today (see Alston\nand Bennett 1988, Bolton 1994, Chappell 1990, and Uzgalis 1990). Thus\nquestions about two of the most basic features of Locke\u2019s\npicture of personal identity\u2014What is Locke\u2019s (general)\nview on identity?; and, What kind of entity is a person,\nexactly?\u2014are the subject of ongoing\n debate.[5]\n\nSo too are the most clearly stated aspects of Locke\u2019s view: the\nclaim that persons have consciousnesses, and the accompanying\nassertion that sameness of person rests in sameness of consciousness.\nWhat is consciousness for Locke? What does Locke mean by\n\u201csameness of consciousness\u201d? Answering these questions\nturns out to be difficult, since Locke does not say much about what he\ntakes consciousness to be (and we only know the persistence conditions\nof any entity, once we get clear on the nominal essence of that\nentity\u2019s kind, according to Locke). Nevertheless, answering\nthese questions is crucial to understanding Locke\u2019s theory of\npersonal identity since it is consciousness centered.\n\nSome scholars take Locke to be a strict memory theorist. In other\nwords, consciousness just is memory for Locke. As will become clear\nbelow, this reading dates back at least as far as Thomas Reid. Of\ncourse, it is the case that the way a person extends their\nconsciousness backward is via memory. It thus may seem as if the\nidentity of consciousness consists in memory, or that to have the same\nconsciousness as she who did x, one has to have a memory of\ndoing x, under Locke\u2019s view. Nevertheless, as Margaret\nAtherton points out, Locke talks at length about forgetfulness, and if\nconsciousness just is memory, then we cannot make sense of\nconsciousness at any given moment where a person is not\ninvoking memory (1983: 277\u2013278). Atherton then goes on to\ndevelop an account of consciousness that is analogous with\nLocke\u2019s conception of animal \u201clife\u201d.\n\nThe identity of consciousness is what allows for the persistence of\nany person, just as the identity of life is what allows for the\npersistence of any animal. \u201cIf we look at Locke in this\nfashion\u201d, Atherton argues, \n\n\nthen what he is saying is that what makes me different at this moment\nfrom any other person is that my thoughts are identical with\nmy consciousness of them. No one else can have my\nconsciousness any more than any organism can have my life. (Atherton\n1983: 283) \n\n\nA person, in Atherton\u2019s reading of Locke, is a single center of\nconsciousness, and so long as that single center of consciousness\npersists, the person persists.\n\nOther scholars hold what is called an \u201cappropriation\nreading\u201d (see Winkler 1991, Thiel 2011, LoLordo 2012). Under\nthis reading, what Locke means when he says that sameness of person\nconsists in sameness of consciousness, is that any person extends back\nonly to those mental events or acts which they take to be their\nown. In other words, the persistence of any person or self is\nbest seen in terms of the \u201csubjective constitution of the\nself\u201d (Winkler 1991: 204). There might be a worry that under\nthis kind of reading, Locke gives persons too much authority. That is,\na person could deny that she is the one who committed the crime, just\nbecause she doesn\u2019t see that act as her own. But, although the\n\u201cself has a certain authority over its own constitution\u201d,\nKenneth Winkler makes clear that \n\n\nit is important to realize that this authority is not consciously\nexerted. I do not willfully disown one act and appropriate another;\ninstead I accept what my consciousness reveals to me. There is also a\nsevere limit on that authority, imposed by the transitivity of\nidentity, \n\n\nwhich comes through, as Winkler notes, in Reid\u2019s\nobjection\u2014an objection which Winkler thinks sympathetic readers\nof Locke can answer and which is discussed in section 3 below (Winkler\n1991: 206).\n\nFrom these treatments it is still difficult to discern what\nconsciousness is for Locke, however. Shelley Weinberg works\nto give a robust picture of Locke\u2019s conception of consciousness\nin her recent book (2016). According to Weinberg, Locke uses the term\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d in two different ways: \n\n\n\u2026Locke seems to see consciousness as (1) a mental state\ninseparable from an act of perception by means of which we are aware\nof ourselves as perceiving, and (2) the ongoing self we are\naware of in these conscious states. (Weinberg 2016: 153) \n\n\nThe former is a momentary psychological state that allows for what\nWeinberg calls \n\n\na momentary subjective experience that the self presently perceiving\nis the same as the self that remembers having once had a past thought\nor action \n\n\nand captures the first-person experience of persisting over time\n(Weinberg 2016: 153). The latter is an \u201cobjective fact of an\nongoing consciousness\u201d (Weinberg 2016: 153). This sense of\nconsciousness is available from a third personal point of view, and\nfills in the gaps that any person\u2019s subjective experience might\nentail.\n\nThus, Weinberg contends that the identity, or continued existence, of\nconsciousness consists in a metaphysical fact, rather than\nappropriation. Nevertheless, Weinberg additionally argues that the\nfirst personal (conscious) experience of our own mental states,\nwhether those states are occurrent sensations, reflections, or via\nremembering is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of personal\nidentity. In other words, to have the awareness (or knowledge) of an\nongoing self\u2014or (2)\u2014we must have (1). Although there is a\nrange of interpretations of Locke on consciousness on the table,\nWeinberg\u2019s book, Consciousness in Locke, marks the\nfirst large-scale treatment of Locke\u2019s views on\n consciousness.[6]\n\nIn addition to the debate over what consciousness is, and what Locke\nmeans when he says that the identity of any person consists in the\nidentity of consciousness, there is ongoing debate about what\nLocke\u2019s stance is when it comes to what can give rise\nto consciousness. That is, there is ongoing discussion of what Locke\nmeans when he says that God could have superadded thinking to formerly\ninert systems of matter, and what Locke\u2019s actual\nposition is on the substantial nature of finite thinkers. There are\nthose who take Locke to be truly agnostic. Those who take this line of\ninterpretation remind readers of Locke\u2019s stated aims at the\nstart of the Essay (as quoted earlier), and the epistemic\nmodesty that Locke maintains throughout the text. But, there are\nothers who think that Locke overstates the probability that souls are\nimmaterial substances, so as not to ruffle the feathers of\nStillingfleet and other religious authorities. Some in the latter\ngroup think that Locke leans toward materialism. This raises questions\nabout how far Anthony Collins (discussed below) departs from the\nLockean picture, or the degree to which Locke anticipates later\nmaterialist pictures of\n persons.[7]\n At the very least, it can be said that Locke challenges the\nimportance that many philosophers place on the immaterial soul to\npersonhood and personal\n identity.[8]\n As might be expected, this was met with mixed reviews.\n3. The Early Modern Reception of Locke\u2019s Picture of Persons\n\nThis section addresses how Locke\u2019s view was received by his\ncontemporaries and by those writing in the remainder of the early\nmodern period (16th-18th centuries). A good\nnumber of philosophers vehemently objected to Locke\u2019s treatment\nof persons, though some defended it, and many others used it as an\ninspiration, or springboard, for their own views.\n\nMany who objected to Locke\u2019s treatment of persons did so because\nthey objected to the decreased importance Locke places on the soul for\npersonhood and personal persistence (see Joseph Butler, Thomas Reid,\nand Samuel Clarke, for example). Many such philosophers argue that\nnumerical identity consists in no change at all, and the only\nkind of entity that allows for identity in this strict sense is an\nimmaterial substance. \n\nAlong the way, some charged Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity\nwith circularity. As Joseph Butler puts it, \n\n\n\u2026[O]ne should really think it self-evident that consciousness\nof personal identity presupposes, and therefore cannot constitute,\npersonal identity; any more than knowledge, in any other case, can\nconstitute truth, which it presupposes. (1736 [1842: 298]) \n\n\nButler then asserts that Locke\u2019s misstep stems from his\nmethodology. He says, \n\n\nThis wonderful mistake may possibly have arisen from hence; that to be\nendued with consciousness is inseparable from the idea of a person, or\nintelligent being. For this might be expressed inaccurately thus, that\nconsciousness makes personality: and from hence it might be concluded\nto make personal identity. (1736 [1842: 298]) \n\n\nOne of the points that Locke emphasizes\u2014that persistence\nconditions are determined via defining kind terms\u2014is what,\naccording to Butler, leads Locke astray.\n\nButler additionally makes the point that memory is not required for\npersonal persistence. He says, \n\n\nBut though present consciousness of what we at present do and feel is\nnecessary to our being the persons we now are; yet present\nconsciousness of past actions or feelings is not necessary to our\nbeing the same persons who performed those actions, or had those\nfeelings. (1736 [1842: 298]) \n\n\nThis is a point that others develop when they assert that\nLocke\u2019s view results in contradiction.\n\nThe most popular, or well known, version of this line of objection\ncomes from Thomas Reid (1785). In the \u201cbrave officer\u201d\nobjection, Reid poses the following challenge to Locke\u2019s theory\nof personal identity. He says:\n\n\nSuppose a brave officer to have been flogged when a boy at school for\nrobbing an orchard, to have taken a standard from the enemy in his\nfirst campaign, and to have been made a general in advanced life;\nsuppose, also, which must be admitted to be possible, that, when he\ntook the standard, he was conscious of his having been flogged at\nschool, and that, when made a general, he was conscious of his taking\nthe standard, but had absolutely lost the consciousness of his\nflogging. These things being supposed, it follows, from Mr.\nLocke\u2019s doctrine, that he who was flogged at school is the same\nperson who took the standard, and that he who took the standard is the\nsame person who was made a general. Whence it follows, if there be any\ntruth in logic, that the general is the same person with him who was\nflogged at school. But the general\u2019s consciousness does not\nreach so far back as his flogging; therefore, according to Mr.\nLocke\u2019s doctrine, he is not the person who was flogged.\nTherefore, the general is, and at the same time is not, the same\nperson with him who was flogged at school. (Reid 1785 [1851:\n248\u2013249]) \n\n\nIn this exercise (and other similar versions of it) we are supposed to\nassume Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity, and maintain that\nsameness of person consists in sameness of consciousness. When we do,\nReid expects we will conclude that the general (C) is the same person\nas he who took the standard from the enemy (B) because the general (C)\nremembers doing so. Additionally he who took the standard from the\nenemy (B) is the same person as he who was flogged at school for\nrobbing the orchard (A) because he (B) remembers that past traumatic\nexperience. Thus C (he who is was made general) is identical to B (he\nwho took the standard) and B (he who took the standard) is identical\nto A (he who was flogged at school).\n\nGiven the law of transitivity (which says that if C is identical to B\nand B is identical to A, then C is identical to A), we should conclude\nthat C (the general) is identical to A (the flogged school boy). But,\nsince we are assuming Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity, Reid\nthinks we cannot come to this conclusion. If we assume Locke\u2019s\nview, Reid contends that we have to conclude that C (the general) is\nnot identical to A (the school boy). This is because C (the general)\nhas no consciousness or memory of having been flogged at school\n(A).\n\nThis and other similar objections are meant to show that if we place\nthe identity of persons in the identity of consciousness, as Locke\nsuggests, then we run into a problem\u2014namely one of\ncontradiction\u2014for we get the result that C and A both are, and\nare not, identical. Nevertheless, as is made clear above, there is\ndebate about whether Locke\u2019s claims about identity of\nconsciousness should be read in terms of memory, and whether Reid is\ncorrect to take \u201cmemory\u201d and \u201cconsciousness\u201d\nas synonymous terms for Locke.\n\nCircularity and contradiction are just two of the major objections\nlaunched at Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity shortly after it\nis published. Importantly, these are objections to which sympathetic\nreaders of Locke are still responding (see Atherton 1983, Weinberg\n2016, LoLordo 2012, Thiel 2011, Garrett 2003, Schechtman 2014, etc).\nThis gives the reader a glimpse of some of the lines of attack that\nwere launched against Locke\u2019s discussion of persons during the\nearly modern period. Nevertheless, not all of Locke\u2019s peers\nattacked his picture of persons, and numerous philosophers worked to\ndefend his view.\n\nOne such philosopher is Catharine Trotter Cockburn. Cockburn pens her\nDefence of Mr. Locke\u2019s Essay of Human Understanding in\n 1702.[9]\n In this text, Cockburn is responding to three pamphlets directed at\nLocke\u2019s\n Essay.[10]\n These pamphlets take aim at Locke\u2019s Essay rather\nbroadly, and Cockburn\u2019s Defence reflects this, but much\nis said about Locke on persons and their persistence conditions\ntherein. Specifically, these pamphlets charge Locke with not proving\nthat the soul is immortal, or threatening proofs of the immortality of\nthe soul. They additionally charge that Locke\u2019s view leaves us\nwith the strange consequence that our souls are in constant flux,\nmaking it the case that we \u201cawake with new souls each\nmorning\u201d. Given the importance of the soul, its persistence, and\nits immortality, to many traditional theories of personal identity,\nthese objections are arguably intended to be objections to\nLocke\u2019s picture of persons. Cockburn is quick to defend Locke,\nbut proceeds carefully and thoroughly as she does so.\n\nCockburn points out that Locke never sets out to prove the soul\nimmortal, and Locke actually claims that it is more probable\nthat the soul is immaterial, than material. Moreover, even if Locke is\nnot committed to the soul being immaterial, this ought not threaten\nproofs of the immortality of the soul. This is because what allows\nLocke to speculate that God could have superadded thinking to formerly\ninert systems of matter is that God is omnipotent, and surely an\nomnipotent being could make souls immortal even if they are material.\nMoreover, proofs for the immortality of the soul that rely on the\nimmateriality of the soul are not likely to convince laymen of the\nsoul\u2019s immortality, and may actually leave them sceptical about\nwhether the soul is indeed immortal (even if it is immaterial). \n\nCockburn additionally attacks the assertion that Locke\u2019s claim\nthat \u201cmen think not always\u201d threatens proofs of the\nimmortality of the soul. Of this she says,\n\n\nBut let it be granted, that it is ever so clearly proved, that\nthinking is necessary to the soul\u2019s existence, that can no more\nprove, that it shall always exist, than it proves, that it has always\nexisted; it being as possible for that omnipotence, which from nothing\ngave the soul a being, to deprive it of that being\nin the midst of its most vigorous reflections, as in an utter\nsuspension of all thought. If then this proposition, that the soul\nalways thinks, does not prove, that it is immortal, the contrary\nsupposition takes not away any proof of it; for it is no less easy to\nconceive, that a being, which has the power of thinking with some\nintervals of cessation from thought, that has existed here for some\ntime in a capacity of happiness or misery, may be continued in, or\nrestored to the same state, in a future life, than that a\nBeing which always thinks, may be continued in the same\nstate. (Cockburn, in Sheridan (ed) 2006: 53) \n\n\nAs Cockburn points out, the notion that the soul is always thinking is\nnot used as evidence for the soul\u2019s immortality. Locke\u2019s\nclaim to the contrary thus ought not count as evidence against it, and\nwe ought to have faith that an omnipotent God will ensure the\nsoul\u2019s immortality (whether it always thinks or not).\nAdditionally, there is ample evidence that Locke thinks the soul is\nimmortal, and that persons will go on to receive divine punishment and\nreward in the next life for their deeds in this life. This comes\nthrough not just in L-N 2.27 of the Essay, but also in\nLocke\u2019s correspondence with Stillingfleet, and many of\nLocke\u2019s religious writings, including the posthumously published\n\u201cResurrectio et quae secuuntur\u201d (though Cockburn\nwould not have had access to the latter while drafting her\n Defence).[11]\n\nFinally, Cockburn argues that the assumption that Locke\u2019s view\nentails that we \u201cawake with new souls each morning\u201d rests\non a misunderstanding. Just as a body that was in motion and comes to\nrest does not become a new body once it starts moving again, a soul\nthat was thinking and ceases to think does not become a new soul once\nthought is restored to it. Thus, Locke\u2019s claim that we do not\nalways think\u2014and indeed may have dreamless sleep\u2014does not\nhave the absurd consequences for the persistence of persons that the\npamphlets charge. To this it might also be added that even if we awake\nwith new souls each morning, it need not mean that we are new persons\neach morning, according to Locke.\n\nThrough the Defence, Cockburn additionally makes clear that\nalthough Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity allows for sci-fi\nswitches such as those described in the \u201cprince and the\ncobbler\u201d passage (L-N 2.27.15), the \u201cwaking and sleeping\nSocrates\u201d passage (2.27.19), and the \u201cday and\nnight-man\u201d passage (2.27.23), Locke does not think that this is\nthe way things ordinarily go. In other words, in\nLocke\u2019s view it is not that persons are switching bodies and\nswapping souls on a regular basis. Rather, Locke is making clear that\nwe should distinguish between the concepts \u201cman\u201d,\n\u201cbody\u201d, \u201csoul\u201d, and \u201cperson\u201d.\nMoreover, the persistence of any person does not always align with the\npersistence of a human being or soul, as many assume. Making this\npoint is the purpose of those imaginary cases.\n\nSixty-seven years after Cockburn\u2019s Defence, and\ntwenty-one years after the correspondence between Cockburn and Edmund\nLaw ends, Law drafts a Defence of his own. Law\u2019s\nDefence of Mr. Locke\u2019s Opinion Concerning Personal\nIdentity (1769) is later included in the 1823 version of\nLocke\u2019s Works, and in it Law offers a particular\nreading of the ontological status of persons. Law defends a\nconsciousness-based view, and makes much of Locke\u2019s claim that\nperson is a \u201cforensic term\u201d. Law moves from this point to\nthe conclusion that Locke thinks persons are modes (or attributes)\nrather than substances (or things in themselves). He says, \n\n\nNow the word Person, as is well observed by Mr.\nLocke\u2026is properly a forensick term, and here\nto be used in the strickt forensick sense, denoting some such quality\nor modification in man as denominates him a moral agent, or an\naccountable creature; renders him the proper subject of\nLaws, and a true object of Rewards or Punishments. (1823:\n1\u20132) \n\n\nThis is significant since whether Lockean persons are best thought of\nas substances, modes, or relations is something that is still debated\namongst Locke scholars today.\n\nWhile some philosophers were happy to defend Locke, as Cockburn and\nLaw did, numerous philosophers writing in the eighteenth century\nutilized Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity as a stepping stone\nto establish their own even more provocative views on persons. The\nways in which these theorists go beyond Locke varies. Some of these\nare outlined\n below.[12]\n\nIn Anthony Collins\u2019s correspondence with Samuel Clarke\n(1707\u20131708), it can often look as if Collins is a mere defender\nof Locke\u2019s view. Collins holds a consciousness-based view of\npersonal identity, and Collins invokes Locke\u2019s discussion of\npersons and their persistence conditions throughout this lengthy\nexchange. Nevertheless, Collins takes Locke\u2019s assertion that for\nall we know God could have superadded the ability to think to formerly\ninert systems of matter, and runs with it. As Larry Jorgensen puts\nit,\n\n\nA significant difference between Collins and Locke\u2026is that\nCollins thought that material systems provided a better explanatory\nbasis for consciousness, which changes the probability calculus.\nCollins provides evidence that casts doubt on Locke\u2019s claim that\n\u201cit is in the highest degree probable\u201d that humans have\nimmaterial souls. Although he is building from a Lockean starting\npoint, namely the possibility that God might superadd thinking to\nmatter, he ends up with a naturalized version: thinking \u201cfollows\nfrom the composition or modification of a material system\u201d\n(Clarke and Collins 2011: 48). (Jorgensen forthcoming) \n\n\nCollins\u2019s view on personal identity is a consciousness-based\nview, but what gives rise to consciousness, according to Collins, is\nlikely a material system. Thus some take Locke\u2019s purported\nagnosticism about the substantial nature of finite thinkers, and\nproceed more forcefully in the direction of materialism. In other\nwords, Locke\u2019s views on the substantial nature of finite\nthinkers opens the door to materialist views of persons and their\npersistence conditions.\n\nOthers take criticisms launched at Locke\u2019s theory of personal\nidentity, including the criticism that the self (or persisting self)\nis a fiction, and appear to embrace such\n consequences.[13]\n This can be seen rather readily in David Hume\u2019s Treatise of\nHuman Nature (1738). In the Treatise, Hume asserts that\nit is not clear how we can even have an idea of the self. This is\nbecause most take selves to be persisting entities, and all of our\nideas come from corresponding impressions. But since our impressions\nconstantly change, there is no one impression that can give rise to\nthe idea we call \u201cself\u201d. Of this Hume says,\n\n\nIt must be some one impression, that gives rise to every real idea.\nBut self or person is not any one impression, but that to which our\nseveral impressions and ideas are suppos\u2019d to have a reference.\nIf any impression gives rise to the idea of self, that impression must\ncontinue invariably the same, thro the whole course of our lives;\nsince self is suppos\u2019d to exist after that manner. But there is\nno impression constant and invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief and\njoy, passions and sensations succeed each other, and never all exist\nat the same time. It cannot, therefore, be from any of these\nimpressions, or from any other, that the idea of self is\nderiv\u2019d; and consequently there is no such idea. (1738 Book I,\nPart IV, Section VI [1896: 251\u2013252]) \n\n\nMoreover, whenever Hume looks for himself, all he finds are\nimpressions. He says, \n\n\nFor my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I\nalways stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or\ncold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never catch\nmyself at any time without a perception, and never can\nobserve any thing but the perception. (1738 [1896: 252]) \n\n\nThis leads Hume to claim that we are just bundles of perceptions, in\nconstant flux (1738 [1896: 252]).\n\nThus it is not only the case that we fail to have an idea of the self,\naccording to Hume, but also the case that, properly speaking, no\nsubsisting self persists from one moment to the next. It is the\nimagination that leads us astray when we think of ourselves, and other\nentities, as persisting over time (1738 [1896: 254]). As Hume puts it,\n\n\n\nThe identity, which we ascribe to the mind of man, is only a\nfictitious one, and of a like kind with that which we ascribe to\nvegetables and animal bodies. (1738 [1896: 259]) \n\n\nHe goes on, \n\n\nIt cannot, therefore, have a different origin, but must proceed from a\nlike operation of the imagination upon like objects. (1738 [1896:\n259]) \n\n\nIn moving away from a more traditional substance-based view of\npersonal identity (where the identity of person lies in the identity\nof soul), Locke opens the door to more fragmentary treatments of\nselves and\n persons.[14]\n\n\nAlong similar lines, some take Locke\u2019s claim that the identity\nof persons lies in the identity of consciousness as fuel for the\nassertion that, properly speaking, there is no special relation\nbetween person x and any other future person. That is,\npersonal identity only exists between present and past selves, not\npresent and future selves. For this reason, we ought not have\nprudential concern, or concern for a future self that is distinct from\nour concern for others. This is the argumentative move that William\nHazlitt makes, and in An Essay on the Principles of Human\nAction (1805), he explicitly sets as his task showing \n\n\n\u2026that the human mind is naturally disinterested, or that it is\nnaturally interested in the welfare of others in the same way, and\nfrom the same motives, by which we are impelled to the pursuit of our\nown interests. (1805: 1) \n\n\nThis line of argumentation is replicated and expanded almost one\nhundred and eighty years later by Derek Parfit in Reasons and\nPersons (1984), though it does not appear that Parfit is aware of\nHazlitt\u2019s view when he drafts his\n own.[15]\n4. Locke\u2019s Lasting Impact on the Personal Identity Debate\n\nThis section briefly outlines the lasting impact that Locke has had on\nthe debate over persons and their persistence conditions by exploring\nhow Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity gets taken up in the\ntwentieth and twenty-first centuries. Most metaphysicians contributing\nto the debate over personal identity refer to Locke\u2019s treatment\nof persons in their texts. Many even directly respond to\nLocke\u2019s view as they flesh out their own.\n\nMost who hold psychological continuity theories of personal identity\ntake their views to be descendants of Locke\u2019s. This is true of\nJohn Perry (1975), David Lewis (1976), Sydney Shoemaker (1984), and\nDerek Parfit (1984), for instance (Schechtman \u201cMemory, Identity,\nand Sameness of Consciousness\u201d, forthcoming in The Lockean\nMind). In fact, Parfit defends what he calls a \u201cLockean\nview\u201d as recently as 2016 (34). What makes each of these views\nLockean (at least according to their authors) is that, as\nLocke does, they take personal identity to consist in the continuity\nof psychological life, and they take this to mean that personal\nidentity is relational. Moreover, like Locke, they emphasize the\nforensic nature of personhood.\n\nMarya Schechtman offers a rival interpretation to those held by Perry,\nLewis, Shoemaker, and Parfit, but Locke is very much in the foreground\nof Schechtman\u2019s narrative account as well. In The\nConstitution of Selves (1996: 15), Schechtman claims, \n\n\nThe argument that personal identity must be defined in psychological\nterms is first systematically presented and defended by Locke in his\nEssay concerning Human Understanding \n\n\nSchechtman then goes on to show that the project of psychological\ncontinuity theorists is \u201cincoherent\u201d because \n\n\n[t]he goal of offering reidentification criterion is fundamentally at\nodds with the goal of defining personal identity in terms of\npsychological continuity\u2026. (1996: 24) \n\n\nImportantly, Schechtman does this not just by making a passing\nreference to Locke and then treating Parfit, Perry, and the like, but\nvia a thorough examination of Locke\u2019s theory, and the objections\nraised to it by Butler, Reid, and others.\n\nMoreover, this is the case not only in Schechtman\u2019s earlier\nwork, but in her most recent work as well. Schechtman includes a\nthirty-two page chapter titled, \u201cLocke and the Psychological\nContinuity Theorists\u201d at the start of Staying Alive:\nPersonal Identity, Practical Concerns, and the Unity of a Life\n(2014), and in \u201cMemory, Identity, and Sameness of\nConsciousness\u201d, Schechtman turns to recent developments in the\npsychological study of memory to update Locke\u2019s view to\n\u201c\u2026capture some of the crucial insights of Locke\u2019s\naccount, and show why it remains relevant and influential\u201d (in\nThe Lockean Mind, forthcoming).\n\nThose who defend animalism\u2014or the view that persons just are\nhuman organisms\u2014hold a position that is quite different from\npsychological continuity theories or narrative based views. Still,\nmost animalists respond to Locke. Some even invoke Locke\u2019s view\nas they develop their own. For example, Eric Olson\u2019s animalist\nview relies very heavily both on Locke\u2019s conception of\n\u201clife\u201d, and the persistence conditions Locke gives for\norganisms (1997: 137\u2013138, etc.). This is why Olson describes his\nview as \u201cLockean\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, some animalists blame Locke for separating the\ndiscussion of persons and personal identity from the discussion of\nhuman beings or human animals. In Animalism: New Essays on\nPersons, Animals & Identity, Stephen Blatti and Paul Snowdon\nask, \u201cWhy was the idea of an animal conspicuously\nabsent\u2026\u201d in the personal identity debate for so long\n(2016: 3)? They go on,\n\n\nTo answer this question, we need to return to Locke\u2019s famous\ndiscussion of personal identity, in which the notion of an animal was\ncentral\u2026Locke exercised great care in specifying the different\nideas for which the words \u2018animal\u2019 and\n\u2018person\u2019 stood. A reasonable conjecture, or proposal, we\nsuggest, is that Locke\u2019s treatment of these two terms and\nnotions was so effective that it generated in people engaging with the\nproblem the conviction that the notion of a person is the central one\nfixing the type of thing the problem is about, with the consequence\nthat the notion of an animal was lost to sight. (2016: 3) \n\n\nLocke does much to distinguish between human beings (or\nmen)\u2014which are animals\u2014and persons, and Blatti and Snowdon\nassert that this sets the stage for how the personal identity debate\nplays out for the next several hundred years. In other words, Locke is\nthe reason that animalist views do not emerge until later in the\ntwentieth\n century.[16]\n\nFinally, even those working to carve out an entirely new space for the\ndiscussion of persons and their persistence conditions say something\nabout Locke as they proceed. Leke Adeofe outlines and develops a\ntripartite picture of persons according to what he calls the\n\u201cAfrican thought system\u201d. As he does, Adeofe aligns his\napproach with Locke\u2019s. He says, \n\n\nMy approach, partly descriptive and partly imaginative, ought to be\nfamiliar; it has been borrowed from a tradition that dates back at\nleast to John Locke. (2004: 69) \n\n\nMoreover, this is the case even though Adeofe uses the African, or\nYoruba, conception of \u201cperson\u201d to challenge Western\nphilosophy\u2019s treatment of persons and their persistence\nconditions.\n\nIn Real People: Personal Identity Without Thought Experiments\n(1988), Kathleen Wilkes takes aim at the proliferation of thought\nexperiments in the personal identity literature. It is clear that\nWilkes has the elaborate thought experiments that Parfit employs\n(including teletransportation, split brain cases, etc.) in mind\nthroughout her critique. But, it is also clear that Wilkes traces this\nmethodology back to Locke. Of this she says, \n\n\nThe subject of personal identity\u2026has probably exploited the\nmethod [of thought experiments] more than any other problem area in\nphilosophy. Many of the examples are familiar:\u2026Locke testing\n\u2018what we would say if\u2019 the soul of a cobbler migrated into\nthe body of a prince, or if the Mayor of Queinborough awoke one day\nwith all of Socrates\u2019 memories. (Wilkes 1988: 6) \n\n\nThe \u201cprince and the cobbler\u201d passage, or L-N 2.27.15,\nproceeds in the opposite direction, with Locke asking us what we would\nconclude about the soul of a prince entering and informing the body of\na cobbler, but, regardless, Wilkes takes Locke and the tradition that\nfollows, as her target as she works to move the discussion of personal\nidentity away from fantasy cases and toward real-life ones.\n\nLocke\u2019s discussion of personal identity is central to the\ncurrent debate over persons and their persistence conditions.\nNevertheless, there are many different versions of Locke\u2019s view\nthat contemporary metaphysicians take themselves to be embracing or\nrejecting. Even those who describe their respective views as\n\u201cLockean\u201d\u2014Parfit and Olson, for instance\u2014can\nend up defending very different pictures of persons. This highlights\njust how difficult it is to determine what Locke\u2019s view on\npersons and their persistence conditions amounts to, despite how clear\nits importance is.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature by Locke", "Other Historical Literature", "Contemporary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature by Locke": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>The Works of John Locke</em>, 10 vols., London: Thomas Tegg,\n1823.", "[L-N] 1689/1694, <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em>,\n(The Clarendon Edition of the Works of John Locke ), Peter H.
