Statman (1992, 435) calls modesty a\n\u201cwill-power\u201d virtue and likens it to courage, self-control,\nand patience. These virtues help one to overcome inclinations that are\ncontrary to virtue and so serve to help one overcome moral\nobstacles.\n\n\nVarious philosophers have seen modesty as functioning as a brake on\ncertain bad tendencies. Iris Murdoch, for example, sees humility as a\nbrake on pride; see Milligan (2007) for a detailed discussion of\nhumility in Murdoch. Foley (2004) highlights a similar strand in\nAquinas, who describes modesty and humility as moderating desires for\npersonal excellence. Kant sometimes describes humility as moderation\nnot of our personal desires, but of our demands on others\n(Doctrine of Virtue 6:462). While Sidgwick (1907/1981, 335)\ndescribes the function of humility as, in part, repressing certain\nemotions of self-admiration.\n\n\nUm (forthcoming) sees modesty as an \u201cexecutive\nvirtue\u201d\u2014one that, like courage, helps to promote the ends\nof other virtues. Though on this account modesty itself has no\npositive aim, he highlights that this does not mean that modesty has\nmerely a negative function; it is not merely a brake on inclinations,\nbut has a positive role of promoting the ends of other moral\nvirtues.\n",
