    "main_text": "The Question of Causes: Capitalism or Culture || Racist Social Sciences\n4.3 Racist Social Sciences\n\nBoth CPR and CRT scholars have shown how a significant amount of\nsocial science research has been functional for the state, with dubious\nresults: providing information, data, statistical regularities that are\nused to formulate state policies; assuming frameworks that overlook\nagency and divert attention from considerations of justice (Murakawa\n2014; Shelby 2018; Bauman 2003; Darby and Rury 2018). Statistics gathering on\nrecidivism rates correlated to race are still used in parole decisions,\nas if recidivism is a natural fact or caused by bad individual choices\nrather than inadequate social services and prejudicial labor markets.\nIn this way social science continues to participate in the construction\nof social ontologies, such as \u201clikely repeat offender,\u201d\nthrough feedback loops between representation and reality. Social\nsciences can then represent racial Others in an ostensibly neutral way\nwhile protecting white dominance (Goldberg 1993, 174).\n\nTo believe that we simply need to find more politically correct\nalternatives for terms like \u201cunderclass\u201d or\n\u201cprimitive\u201d is to assume that the object of reference can\nbe defined and demarcated within racist cultures outside of a racist\nlinguistic system. If we understand racism to be infecting the\ndelimitation of fields of knowledge and the formation of objects as\nwell as associated meanings, then the task must be to critically assess\ncultures, discourses, and institutions at every level. The project of\ninquiry then becomes one of understanding how racial domination has\nbeen reproduced across generations, encompassing political\nsensibilities from conservatism to liberalism.\n\nGoldberg\u2019s approach may be interpreted by some as a postmodern\napproach that has gone too far in conferring sufficient\ncausality to language or discourse (see e.g. Mills\u2019 critique of\nHall, 2010, on this same point). Yet both Goldberg and Hall continually\nemphasize material structures alongside linguistic and discursive ones.\nThere remains the question of how to understand the relation between\nthese various aspects of racist cultures. The question of whether there\nare ultimate or sufficient causes, however, does not animate\nGoldberg\u2019s work. His goal is to unearth the cultural and\ndiscursive elements involved in the constitution, perpetuation, and\nfluid transformations of racist concepts and racist societies. We need\nto understand the constitutive discourses operating in the social\nsciences to grasp how it can be the case that they \u201chave done\nmuch to create, authorize, legitimate, and extend both the figures of\nthe racial Otherness and the exclusion of various\nracisms\u201d (Goldberg 1993, 175).\n Other philosophers who analyze the social sciences have also\noffered a strong critique of existing frameworks and policy approaches\n(esp. Darby and Rury 2018 meant; Shelby 2018). Tommie Shelby critiques\nmainstream work on racial poverty in the social sciences for\ndownplaying the agency of the poor as well as the rationality and\nmoral reasoning that can motivate decisions to self-segregate, for\nexample, or, at times, to resist certain kinds of wage labor. Ghetto\npoverty is caused by macro structural forces, but the collection of\nindividuals forced into these spaces are actively endeavoring to\nsurvive, to occasionally flourish, and also to foment resistance of\none sort or another. We cannot explain their choices by their culture\n(as in the \u201cculture of poverty\u201d thesis) but by their\nchoice situation. We also need frameworks that allow theorists to see\nthe creative and assertive responses devised by collective effort (the\nassertiveness of rap, for example, that re-describes social worlds\nagainst dominant misrepresentations). Shelby no less than Goldberg\ntakes apart the linguistic apparatus that produces a large body of\nsocial science functional for racial capitalism. And his use of what\nis a usually denigrating term \u2013 \u201cghetto\u201d \u2013 may\nbe seen as an instance of what Goldberg calls \u201cstanding inside\nthe terms\u201d as a means to transform and redirect their political\neffects (1993, 174).\n\nCritical philosophers of race, even those influenced by\npostmodernism, tend to set limits on the plasticity of linguistic\ntransformation. Goldberg suggests that those designated by the term\n\u201cprimitive,\u201d such as indigenous groups, \u201care rarely\nin a position of power, politically and technologically, to take on the\ncategory as a form of self-reference, even should they choose to\u201d\n(1993, 174). Speech, however constitutive its reach, exists in a\nmaterial world.\n",
