    "preamble": "\n\n\nArthur Prior (1914\u20131969) undertook pioneering work in\nintensional logic at a time when modality and intensional concepts in\ngeneral were under attack. He invented tense logic and was principal\ntheoretician of the movement to apply modal syntax to the formalisation\nof a wide variety of phenomena. Prior and Carew Meredith devised a\nversion of the possible worlds semantics several years before Saul\nKripke published his first paper on the topic. An iconoclast and a\nresourceful innovator, Prior inspired many to undertake work in\nintensional logic.\n\n\nMuch of Prior\u2019s research consisted of the tireless exploration\nof a labyrinth of axiomatic calculi. Yet for him the point of a logical\ncalculus was always that it had a subject matter, be it time,\nobligation, agency, or even biology, and a concern for philosophical\nproblems never lay far below his theorems. It was the extra-symbolic\nworld that mattered to Prior, not the formal results per se. He\nwrote:\n\n\n\nPhilosophy, including Logic, is not primarily about language, but\nabout the real world. \u2026 Formalism, i.e. the theory that Logic is\njust about symbols and not things, is false. Nevertheless, it is\nimportant to \u2018formalise\u2019 as much as we can, i.e. to state\ntruths about things in a rigorous language with a known and explicit\nstructure. (1996a: 45)\n\n\nThe first New Zealand-born logician, Prior was the founding father of\nlogic in New Zealand and also a driving force behind the renaissance\nin British logic from 1956.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Work on Tense Logic\n\n\nPrior\u2019s most significant achievement was the invention and\ndevelopment of tense logic. Tense logic involves two new modal\noperators, \u2018It will be the case that\u2019 and \u2018It has\nbeen the case that\u2019.\n\n\nDuring the 1940s, the logic of time was in its infancy. In 1941\nFindlay briefly suggested a \u2018calculus of tenses\u2019, as\nexplained below, and in 1947 both \u0141o\u015b, in Poland, and\nReichenbach, in the United States, published limited proposals\nconcerning the logic of time (\u0141o\u015b 1947, Reichenbach 1947;\n\u0141o\u015b\u2019s paper was reviewed in English by Hi\u017c 1951;\nsee also Prior 1967a: 12\u201315, 212\u2013213, and Tkaczyk and Jarmu\u017cek\n2018). However, neither \u0141o\u015b nor Reichenbach anticipated the\ncrucial idea of using modal operators to create a formal calculus of\ntime.\n\n\nPrior catalysed the field with his detailed proposals for a modal\nlogic of time-distinctions. His tense logic was nothing less than a new\nparadigm for the study of time (Hasle and \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2016).\nPrior went on to use his tense logic to articulate theories about the\nstructure and metaphysics of time and to mount a robust defence of\nfreewill and indeterminism. Tense logic is now also employed for the\nmanipulation of time-dependent data and has numerous applications in\ncomputing, including database management, program verification, and\ncommonsense reasoning in artificial intelligence.\n1.1 Origins of Tense Logic\n\n\nPrior\u2019s earliest mention of a logic of time-distinctions is to\nbe found in the penultimate chapter of his unpublished manuscript\nThe Craft of Formal Logic. The Craft, completed in\n1951 (Prior 1951), was intended to be his first book on formal logic.\nFollowing von Wright in \u2018Deontic Logic\u2019 (von Wright 1951b),\nPrior remarked that there are other groups of modal predicates to be\nset alongside the ordinary or \u2018alethic\u2019 modes of necessity\nand possibility. He referred to these non-alethic modalities as\n\u2018quasi-modals\u2019. After noting that Peter of Spain classified\nadverbial distinctions of time as modes, he said:\n\n\n\nThat there should be a modal logic of time-distinctions has been\nsuggested in our own day by Professor Findlay. (1951: 750)\n\n\n\nFindlay\u2019s paper \u2018Time: A Treatment of Some\nPuzzles\u2019 had appeared in the Australasian Journal of\nPsychology and Philosophy in 1941. Prior became aware of it as a\nresult of its appearance in Flew\u2019s 1951 collection Essays on\nLogic and Language, which arrived in New Zealand just as Prior was\nwriting the final chapters of The Craft. The suggestion Prior\nreferred to is barely more than a passing comment: \u2018[O]ur\nconventions with regard to tenses are so well worked out that we have\npractically the materials in them for a formal calculus\u2019, wrote\nFindlay. He continued in a footnote:\n\n\n\nThe calculus of tenses should have been included in the modern\ndevelopment of modal logics. It includes such obvious propositions as\nthat\n\n\n\n\\(x\\) present \\(\\leftrightarrow(x\\) present) present;\n\n\n\\(x\\) future \\(\\leftrightarrow(x\\) future) present \\(\\leftrightarrow \n(x\\) present) future;\n\n\n\nalso such comparatively recondite propositions as that\n\n\n\n\\((x).(x\\) past) future; i.e., all events, past,\npresent and future, will be past.\n\n\n\n\nPrior\u2019s discovery of Findlay\u2019s footnote followed hard on\nthe heels of another discovery. In 1949 he learned (from Geach\u2019s\nreview of Julius Weinberg\u2019s Nicolaus of Autricourt: A Study\nin 14th Century Thought) that, for the scholastics, an expression\nlike \u2018Socrates is sitting down\u2019\u2014an example discussed\nby Aristotle\u2014is complete, in the sense of being assertible as it\nis, and is true at certain times, false at others. Prior was more\nfamiliar with the view (still widespread today) that such an expression\nis incomplete until a time-reference is supplied, and hence\nthat\u2014despite the seeming naturalness of doing so\u2014one cannot\nregard the expression as changing its truth-value with the passage of\ntime. The ancient view, that this change in value can and does occur,\nwas a crucial discovery for Prior. He wrote about it in The\nCraft, contrasting it with the modern view that \u2018Socrates is\nsitting down\u2019 is not a \u2018complete proposition\u2019 but\nrather a \u2018movable part\u2019 that occurs in many different\ncomplete propositions: \u2018\u201cSocrates is sitting down\u201d is\nthought of, we might say, as a diary entry, with a date, hour, minute\nand second beside it, and this date, etc. is part of the\n\u201cproposition\u201d\u2019 (1951: 98). (For more about\nPrior\u2019s discussion of temporality in The Craft see\nMarkoska-Cubrinovska 2017.)\n\n\nThis idea that tensed propositions are liable to be true at one time\nand false at another became central to Prior\u2019s philosophy. In a\nsummary of his views, composed nearly two decades later, he wrote:\n\n\n\nCertainly there are unchanging truths, but there are changing truths\nalso, and it is a pity if logic ignores these, and leaves it \u2026\nto comparatively informal \u2018dialecticians\u2019 to study the more\n\u2018dynamic\u2019 aspects of reality. (Prior 1996a: 46)\n\n1.1.1 Tense, indeterminism and freewill\n\n\nGeach\u2019s review sent Prior back to the ancient sources, and he\nfound Aristotle saying that some propositions about the future, namely\npropositions concerning events that are not determined at the time of\nutterance, are neither true nor false when they are uttered, since\nthere is, at that time, as yet no definite fact with which they accord\nor conflict. Prior quoted Aristotle\u2019s argument (in ch. 9 of\nDe Interpretatione) for believing in such events: if the\nfuture were determined, \u2018there would be no need to deliberate or\ntake trouble, on the supposition that if we should adopt a certain\ncourse, a certain result would follow, while, if we did not, the result\nwould not follow\u2019 (Prior 1953: 322\u2013323).\n\n\nFor many years Prior had been a Barthian Calvinist, and, as Prior\nput it, the theologian Karl Barth \u2018attacked freewill in the name\nof religion\u2019 (Prior n.d.b: 1). In his mature work, however, Prior\nwas on the side of freewill and indeterminism. He developed profound\ntechnical analyses of the idea that the future is open, a branching\ntree of possibilities. The mature Prior said:\n\n\n\nOne of the big differences between the past and the future is that\nonce something has become past, it is, as it were, out of our\nreach\u2014once a thing has happened, nothing we can do can make it\nnot to have happened. But the future is to some extent, even though it\nis only to a very small extent, something we can make for ourselves.\nAnd this is a distinction which a tenseless logic is unable to express.\n(Prior 1996b: 48)\n\n\n\nThere can be no doubt that the origin of Prior\u2019s tense logic\nwas bound up with his change of mind about freewill. Landmark papers on\nhis path from determinism to indeterminism and the rejection of\nCalvinism were:\n\n\n\n\n(Prior n.d.a), in which a transitional soft determinism is\npropounded. This early typescript\u2014which cites William James on\nfreewill and determinism\u2014probably dates from around 1941.\nAccording to determinism, the \u2018causal chain\u2019 is\n\u2018all-embracing\u2019, Prior said, but even though we are\n\u2018part of the causal chain\u2019, we are not \u2018pure\neffect\u2019. The \u2018chain of causation\u2019 runs\n\u2018within\u2019 us \u2018as well as outside\u2019: we ourselves\nare causes. He continued: \u2018The only kind of universe in which\ngeneral freedom is conceivable is one which we might call\n\u201cloosely packed\u201d\u2019, and he emphasized that determinism\n\u2018is compatible with a relatively loose packing of the things in\nthe world\u2019. In a loosely packed universe, \u2018Causes and\neffects may not form a single chain; events may run in a number of\nchains which are partly independent of one another\u2019. He\nexplained:\n\n\n\nIn a box of powder which is ground infinitely small and packed\ninfinitely tightly, the slightest disturbance in one area will affect\nthe most distant grains. If, however, the grains are relatively large\nand packed relatively loosely, one can imagine, for example, a circular\nmotion of the grains in one area which does not affect even quite\nclosely adjacent grains at all \u2026 Common notions of freewill and\npartial responsibility seem to involve a picture of the world rather\nlike this\u2026. The common notion assumes a \u2018moderately\u2019\nloose packing in which there is elbow-room for a measure of free\naction, but in which we are sufficiently bound together by\n\u2018necessity\u2019 for us to have a measure of influence on one\nanother and responsibility for one another.\n\n\n\n(In another typescript from the same period (Prior n.d.b) he wrote\nthat \u2018our choices are pre-determined\u2019 but that \u2018it is\nin our power to find out what the forces are which determine our\nchoices, and even to exercise some control over them (while, of course,\nbeing in this very exercise \u201ccontrolled\u201d by other forces\nwhich do not worry us). Prior\u2019s (n.d.b) is discussed in detail in\nHasle (1999) and (2012).)\n\n\n\n\n(Prior 1947), in which he firmly distances himself from Barth.\n\n\n\n\n(Prior 1953), in which (following the Polish logician Jan\n\u0141ukasiewicz) he uses a 3-valued logic to formalize the\nAristotelian view that \u2018propositions about such future events as\nare not already predetermined\u2019 are neither true nor false (1953:\n322).\n\n\n\n\n(Prior 1955b), his first publication on tense logic.\n\n\n1.1.2 The first tense logic\n\n\nPrior wished to formalise the ancient insight that propositions can\nchange in truth value with the passage of time. He soon realised that\noff-the-shelf modal syntax could be adapted to do this. It was simply a\nmatter of taking seriously the idea he had discussed in The Craft\nof Formal Logic: tense is a species of modality, to be set\nalongside the ordinary (\u2018alethic\u2019) modes of necessity and\npossibility. When he discovered the \u2018Master\nArgument\u2019 of Megarian logician Diodorus Chronos (in Benson\nMates\u2019 1953 book Stoic Logic), Prior\u2019s exegesis of\nDiodorus\u2019s argument became the backdrop to his first publication\non tense logic, \u2018Diodoran Modalities\u2019 (1955b).\n\n\nDiodorus defined the possible as what is or will be true: according\nto Diodorus, what actually happens is all that can happen.\nDiodorus, Prior later said, \u2018seems to have been an ancient Greek\nW.V. Quine, who regarded the Aristotelian logic of possibility and\nnecessity with some scepticism, but offered nevertheless some\n\u201charmless\u201d senses that might be attached to modal\nwords\u2019 (1967a: 16). Prior found this deterministic definition of\nthe possible uncongenial and set about locating a fallacy in the\nargument that Diodorus had used to support it, the so-called Master\nArgument:\n\n\n\nThe aim of the Master Argument, as I conceive it, was to refute the\nAristotelian view that while it is now beyond the power of men or gods\nto affect the past, there are alternative futures between which choice\nis possible. Against this, Diodorus held that the possible is simply\nwhat either is or will be true. (Prior 1962a: 138; see also 1967a:\n33.)\n\n\n\nConsideration of the Master Argument brought together three of\nPrior\u2019s great interests: indeterminism, modal logic, and the\nlogic of time. In the course of his reflections on the argument,\nFindlay\u2019s footnote pushed its way to the front of his mind. His\nwife Mary remembered \u2018his waking me one night, coming and sitting\non my bed, and reading a footnote from John Findlay\u2019s article on\ntime, and saying he thought one could make a formalised tense\nlogic\u2019 (Kenny 1970: 336).\n\n\n\u2018Diodoran Modalities\u2019, completed by early 1954, set out\nPrior\u2019s initial exploration of his calculus of tenses. On the\nfirst page he wrote:\n\n\n\nI here propose to do something a little different, namely to employ\nthe ordinary propositional variables \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(q\\)\u2019, \u2018\\(r\\)\u2019 etc., for\n\u2018propositions\u2019 in the Diodoran sense [i.e. propositions\nwhich \u2018may be true at one time and false at another\u2019] and\nto use certain operators which take such propositions as arguments, and\nwhich form functions taking such propositions as values. I shall use\n\u2018\\(Fp\\)\u2019 for \u2018It will be the case that\n\\(p\\)\u2019. (1955b: 205.)\n\n\n\nThe calculus of tenses presented in \u2018Diodoran\nModalities\u2019 is the system produced by adding the following\naxioms, rules, and definition, to the ordinary propositional calculus.\n\\((1)\\ F(p \\vee q) \\equiv(Fp) \\vee \n(Fq)\\). \\((2)\\ FFp \\rightarrow Fp\\). (3)\u00a0If \\(p \\equiv q\\) is provable in the calculus (or is an axiom) then\n\\(Fp \\equiv Fq\\) follows. (4) If \\(p\\) is provable\nin the calculus (or is an axiom) then \\(Gp\\) follows; where\n\\(Gp\\), the future perpetual form \u2018It will always be the\ncase that \\(p\\)\u2019, is defined as\n\\(\\neg F\\neg p\\).\n1.1.3 Prior\u2019s 1954 Wellington Address\n\n\nThere was clearly more work to be done on this calculus\u2014for\none thing there was no mention of the past\u2014and Prior duly set\nabout extending his creation. He worked fast, and in August 1954\nunveiled a system of far greater sophistication, in his Presidential\nAddress to the second New Zealand Congress of Philosophy, held in\nWellington.\n\n\nPrior\u2019s expanded calculus contained two additional axioms\nconcerning futurity, \\(Gp \\rightarrow Fp\\) and \\(Fp \\rightarrow FFp.\\)\nThere was also a simplification: instead of following his previous\npractice and defining \\(G\\) as \\(\\neg F\\neg\\), Prior took \\(G\\) as\nundefined and defined \\(F\\) as \\(\\neg G\\neg\\); this enabled him to\nreplace the somewhat unwieldy axiom (1) by the more elegant \\(G(p\n\\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow(Gp \\rightarrow Gq)\\). Moreover, he\ntransformed this calculus of \u2018pure futurity\u2019 into a\ncalculus of \u2018pure pastness\u2019 by replacing \\(F\\) throughout\nthe axioms, rules, and definition, by the past tense operator \\(P\\)\n(\u2018It has been the case that\u2019), and replacing \\(G\\) by the\npast perpetual operator \\(H\\) (\u2018It has always been the case\nthat\u2019).\n\n\nLike ordinary modal logic, both these \u2018pure\u2019 calculi are\nmonomodal; that is, each contains only one undefined modal\noperator. Prior wanted a \u2018full tense calculus\u2019, containing\nthe two undefined operators \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), together with\nthe operators \\(F\\) and \\(P\\) defined in terms of them (such\na calculus is known as a \\(bi\\)modal logic). To obtain the full\ncalculus it was not enough simply to bundle together the two\n\u2018pure\u2019 systems, because the two tense operators would\nremain independent of one another. Some interactive axioms,\n\u2018laws which relate to the interaction of pastness and\nfuturity\u2019, were also required. Prior chose \\(p \\rightarrow\\)\n\\(GPp\\) and \\(p \\rightarrow HFp.\\)\n\n\nWhat are the justifications for his axioms and rules? In\n\u2018Diodoran Modalities\u2019, Prior was content to describe\n\\(FFp \\rightarrow Fp\\) as \u2018obvious enough\u2019, but by\nthe time of the Wellington Congress his thinking had moved forward\nconsiderably. He there set out what he called the\n\u2018\\(l\\)-calculus\u2019 (he was later to prefer the term\n\u2018\\(U\\)-calculus\u2019). \u2018\\(l\\)\u2019 is the\nrelation \u2018is later than\u2019 (relating dates). In the\n\\(l\\)-calculus, the propositions of the tense calculus are treated\nas expressing properties of dates. \u2018lxz &\n\\(px\\)\u2019 (where \\(p\\) might be \u2018Socrates is\nsitting down\u2019, for example) is read \u2018\\(x\\) is later\nthan \\(z\\) and \\(p\\) at \\(x\\)\u2019 \\((x\\) and\n\\(z\\) are dates). Using the (arbitrary) date \\(z\\) to\nrepresent the time of utterance, \\(Fp\\) is equated with\n\\(\\exists x(lxz \\amp px)\\) (\u2018\\(p\\) at\nsome time later than \\(z\\)\u2019), and \\(Pp\\) with\n\\(\\exists x(lzx \\amp px)\\) (\u2018\\(p\\) at\nsome time earlier than \\(z\\)\u2019). \\(Gp\\) and \\(Hp\\)\nare equated with the universal quantifications\n\\(\\forall x(lxz \\rightarrow px)\\) and\n\\(\\forall x(lzx \\rightarrow px)\\) respectively. (Much\nlater, Prior recast the date-terms of his \\(U\\)-calculi as\n\u2018instant propositions\u2019\u2014propositions true at one and\nonly one instant\u2014so introducing what is now called \n hybrid logic.)\n\n\nPrior showed that if various assumptions are made concerning the\nrelation \\(l\\), the axioms of the tense calculus can be proved in the\n\\(l\\)-calculus. (Two years later, he and Meredith used essentially the\nsame strategy in creating the possible worlds semantics for ordinary\nmodal logic.) He discovered that \\(FFp \\rightarrow Fp\\) and its image\n\\(PPp\\rightarrow Pp\\) follow from the assumption \\(lxy \\rightarrow\n(lyz \\rightarrow lxz),\\) stating that the relation \\(l\\) is\ntransitive. \\(Fp \\rightarrow FFp\\) and its image \\(Pp \\rightarrow\nPPp\\) follow given the assumption lxz \\(\\rightarrow \\exists\ny(lxy \\amp lyz),\\) stating that \u2018between any two dates there is\nanother date\u2019 (a condition sometimes said to express\ntime\u2019s density). \\(Gp \\rightarrow Fp\\) follows given\n\\(\\exists xlxz,\\) stating that \u2018there is a date later than any\ngiven date\u2019, i.e., that there is no last moment of time.  \\(Hp\n\\rightarrow Pp\\) requires \\(\\exists xlzx,\\) stating that there is no\nfirst moment of time.\n\n\nPrior showed, furthermore, that no assumptions at all are needed for\nthe derivation of the two interactive axioms \\(p \\rightarrow GPp\\) and\n\\(p \\rightarrow HFp,\\) nor for the axioms \\(G(p \\rightarrow q)\n\\rightarrow(Gp \\rightarrow Gq)\\) and \\(H(p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow\n(Hp \\rightarrow Hq)\\). In the case of these formulae, the ordinary\nmachinery of truth-functional and quantifier logic suffices for their\nproof. The same is true, he showed, of the four rules of the tense\ncalculus ((3) and (4) above, together with the \\(P\\) form of (3) and\nthe \\(H\\) form of (4)). This part, therefore, of Prior\u2019s\ncalculus of tenses is purely logical, whereas others of the\naxioms\u2014those stating that \\(l\\) is transitive, that time is\ndense, and that there is no first or last moment of\ntime\u2014express physical properties of time. In later\nwork, Prior considered further calculi, in which these particular\n\u2018physical\u2019 axioms are replaced by others, for example\naxioms stating that time has a first moment, or is linear (a\n\u2018straight line\u2019), or is non-linear, with the present\nalways standing at the junction of a number of branches, any of which\nmight become the actual future.\n\n\nWhich is metaphysically basic, the tense calculus or the\n\\(l\\)-calculus? Prior issued a warning against regarding the above\ninterpretation of the tense calculus within the \\(l\\)-calculus as\n\u2018a metaphysical explanation of what we mean by is, has been and\nwill be\u2019: the \\(l\\)-calculus, he said, is not\n\u2018metaphysically fundamental\u2019. His reason is that\n\u2018\\(F\\)(Socrates is sitting down)\u2019 means \u2018It is\nnow the case that it will be the case that Socrates is sitting\ndown\u2019, whereas there is no genuine way of representing the\nindexical \u2018now\u2019 in the \\(l\\)-calculus (the date\nvariable \\(z\\) is not an indexical, any more than \u201821\nJanuary 1954\u2019 is an indexical). Prior continued: \u2018If there\nis to be any \u201cinterpretation\u201d of our calculi in the\nmetaphysical sense, it will probably need to be the other way round;\nthat is, the \\(l\\)-calculus should be exhibited as a logical\nconstruction out of the \\(PF\\)-calculus rather than vice\nversa.\u2019 This idea of the primacy of the tense calculus over\nthe \\(l\\)-calculus (or, as he later put it, of McTaggart\u2019s\n\\(A\\)-series over the \\(B\\)-series) became a central and\ndistinctive tenet of his philosophy. Prior took a similar metaphysical\nposition with respect to ordinary modal logic, arguing that the\nlanguage of possible worlds is to be interpreted in terms of a language\nwith modal operators and not, as is popularly held, vice\nversa. These issues form the theme of his final book Worlds,\nTimes and Selves. (For more about the world\u2013time parallel, see Rini and Cresswell 2012.)\n1.1.4 The Master Argument and three-valued logic\n\n\nIn a matchless piece of philosophical reconstruction\u2014in\n\u2018Diodoran Modalities\u2019\u2014Prior expresses the conclusion\nof the Master Argument, that what neither is nor will be true is not\npossible, as \\((\\neg p \\amp \\neg Fp) \\rightarrow \\neg \\Diamond p\\),\nand derives this in his calculus from Diodorus\u2019 premisses, \\(Pp\n\\rightarrow \\neg \\Diamond \\neg Pp\\) and \\(\\neg\\Diamond q \\rightarrow\n(\\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow \\neg\\Diamond p),\\) together with\ntwo \u2018broad assumptions about time, likely to have been taken for\ngranted both by Diodorus and by his main opponents\u2019, viz. \\(p\n\\rightarrow HFp\\) and \\((\\neg p \\amp \\neg Fp)\n\\rightarrow P\\neg Fp.\\)\n\n\nSo the Master Argument is indeed valid. The fallacy, Prior tells us,\nlies with the second \u2018broad assumption\u2019 \\((\\neg p \\amp\n\\neg Fp) \\rightarrow P\\neg Fp\\) (which says: when anything\nneither is nor will be the case, it has been the case that it will not\nbe the case). This, Prior tells us, is not true if \\(p\\) refers to a\nfuture contingency, and thus has the truth value \u00bd or\n\u2018indeterminate\u2019. Where \\(p\\) is indeterminate, both \\(Fp\\)\nand \\(\\neg Fp\\) are indeterminate, so the consequent of the disputed\nformula, \\(P \\neg Fp\\), is false. \\(\\neg p\\) must also be\nindeterminate (for if the negation of \\(p\\) were determinate, \\(p\\)\ncould not be indeterminate). Thus the antecedent of the \u2018broad\nassumption\u2019, \\(\\neg p \\amp \\neg Fp\\), is indeterminate, since\nboth its conjuncts are indeterminate.\n\n\nThe next step of Prior\u2019s argument was to appeal to\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s 3-valued truth-table for \\(\\rightarrow\\). According to\nthe table, an indicative conditional with a false consequent and an\nindeterminate antecedent is not true but indeterminate:\n\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n1\n\u00bd\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n\u00bd\n0\n\n\n\u00bd\n1\n1\n\u00bd\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nThus Prior was able to \u2018deny that propositions of the form [\\((\n\\neg p \\amp \\neg Fp) \\rightarrow\\) P\\(\\neg\\)Fp] are in all cases\ntrue\u2019, so faulting the Master Argument.\n\n\nThe Master Argument for determinism continued to exercise Prior for\nthe rest of his life, and some of the most useful and mathematically\nmost interesting parts of his work were inspired by his thoughts on it.\nTo pick just one example, from computer science, tense calculi that\nPrior developed\u2014leading on from the idea that the Master Argument\nis defeated if time is conceived as branching into the\nfuture\u2014have become useful for describing and verifying the\nbehaviour of distributed and concurrent processing systems (see e.g.\nBen-Ari, Pnueli, and Manna 1983).\n1.2 Tense Logic Comes of Age\n\n\nThe text of Prior\u2019s Wellington address was not published until\n1958 (in the journal Franciscan Studies, under the title\n\u2018The Syntax of Time-Distinctions\u2019). It was Prior\u2019s\n1956 John Locke lectures at Oxford and the ensuing book Time and\nModality (published in 1957) that brought Prior\u2019s\ndiscoveries in tense and modal logic before a wider audience. A number\nof logicians\u2014notably Thomas, Geach, Lemmon, Meredith and\nKripke\u2014took an immediate interest in Priorean modal logic, in\nparticular his Diodoran system and his system \\(Q\\), a multivalued\nlogic admitting the existence of contingent beings. Less immediate\nattention was paid to his tense logic. The bibliography of the subject\nin Prior\u2019s 1968 volume Papers on Time and Tense reveals\nthat up until 1965 the only publications in the field were either by\nPrior himself or were reviews of his work (chiefly of Time and\nModality). Yet a momentum was slowly gathering.\n\n\nAt a colloquium on modal and many-valued logics held in Helsinki, in\n1962, Hintikka proposed a tense-logical construal of his possible\nworlds semantics, maintaining that \u2018if we do not want to tie our\nlogic to old-fashioned physics, we are undoubtedly wiser if we \u2026\nno longer require that the alternativeness relation (in this case it\ncould perhaps be more appropriately termed \u201cfuturity\nrelation\u201d) effect a linear ordering\u2019 (1963: 76). Prior had\nhappily tied his 1954 \\(l\\)-relation to \u2018old-fashioned\nphysics\u2019: he later made it clear that he did not think much of\nthe view of time embodied in twentieth century physics (1996b:\n49\u201351).\n\n\nA pupil of von Wright, Hintikka had been stimulated by the\nlatter\u2019s proposals for the wide application of modal logic (see\nthe next Section) and had come to appreciate the possibility of\napplying modal notions to the study of the logic of time before he\nlearned of Prior\u2019s sophisticated work (through reading Time\nand Modality, which he reviewed in 1958). Hintikka was perhaps the\nfirst to stress the importance of a semantical approach to the tenses.\nDuring the early 1960s, he travelled regularly between Helsinki and\nCalifornia and his ideas on tense influenced a number of logicians\nworking in California, in particular Dana Scott.\n\n\n1962 was a significant year for tense logic. As well as\nHintikka\u2019s talk in Helsinki, Scott gave a lecture on tense logic\nin Amsterdam (Hans Kamp, then an undergraduate, was among his\naudience). Scott\u2019s work on tense logic was one aspect of his\nstudy of the semantics of natural language, which he pursued in close\ncollaboration with Richard Montague. Scott was aware of Prior\u2019s\nwork, and was also influenced in his understanding of tense by\nReichenbach\u2019s 1947 analysis (the latter was a powerful figure at\nUCLA until his death in 1953). Prior himself was critical of\nReichenbach\u2019s analysis of the tenses, describing it as having\nbeen \u2018in some ways a hindrance rather than a help to the\nconstruction of a logic of tenses\u2019 (Prior 1967a: 13).\nScott\u2019s work in tense logic was different in style from\nPrior\u2019s. He established the completeness and decidability of\nvarious axiomatic tense logics, and also showed that the temporal\npredicate logic of the reals is non-axiomatisable. His work in tense\nlogic is widely cited but remains unpublished. Prior learned of\nScott\u2019s work in January 1964, in a letter from Lemmon (who the\nprevious year had left Oxford for Claremont, near Los Angeles).\n\n\nIn 1965 Prior visited California for several months, as Flint\nProfessor of Philosophy at UCLA. For the first time he found himself\namong a group of enthusiasts for tense logic. Shortly after the visit\nended he was to write: \u2018I suppose that California is the most\nlogically mature place in the world, and now that the logic of tenses\nis pursued so widely and so vigorously there, its raw pioneering days\ncan be considered over\u2019 (1967a: vi). When Prior arrived at UCLA,\nNino Cocchiarella was just completing a Ph.D. thesis on quantified\nmodal and tense logic, under Montague\u2019s supervision (\u2018Tense\nand Modal Logic: A Study in the Topology of Temporal Reference\u2019).\nCocchiarella\u2019s interest in the philosophy of time had initially\nbeen aroused by Reichenbach\u2019s work on space and time, but it was\nhis acquaintance with Prior\u2019s Time and Modality that\nswept him into tense-logical research. (Only later did he learn of\nScott\u2019s work.) Prior\u2019s visit also coincided with Hans\nKamp\u2019s arrival at UCLA as a graduate student. Kamp attended\nPrior\u2019s lectures on tense logic in his first semester and became\ndeeply interested in the subject. The lectures led more or less\ndirectly to the topic of Kamp\u2019s Ph.D. thesis, written under\nMontague\u2019s supervision and entitled \u2018On Tense Logic and the\nTheory of Order\u2019 (1968). In Kamp\u2019s work the development of\ntense logic achieved a new level of formal sophistication. Segerberg,\ntoo, had just arrived in California, to study under Scott at Stanford.\nSegerberg had become interested in tense logic in Finland in 1964, at a\nseries of summer seminars given by von Wright, who was independently\npursuing a tense logic arising from his study of the logic of action,\nand later shown to be equivalent to a system Prior had discussed in\nTime and Modality (Prior 1957: 23\u20134; see von Wright 1965 and\nSegerberg 1967, 1989).\n\n\nIn December 1965 Scott delivered his famous talk to the Hume Society\nat Stanford entitled \u2018The Logic of Tenses\u2019. A multilith of\nScott\u2019s handwritten notes for this talk has been circulating ever\nsince among tense logicians. Four days later Prior himself addressed\nthe Society, again on tense logic. It was in this fecund atmosphere\nthat Prior completed the manuscript of his book Past, Present and\nFuture, which remains to this day one of the most important\nreferences in the field.\n\n\nThe years 1965\u20137 saw the publication of work in tense logic by\n\u00c5qvist, Bull, Clifford, Cocchiarella, Garson, Geach, Hamblin,\nLuce, Makinson, Rescher, Segerberg, von Wright\u2014and, of course,\nPrior. In a little over a decade Prior\u2019s invention had become an\ninternationally pursued branch of logic.\n\n\nPrior always had a firm belief that his tense logic would one day find\nuseful applications in other disciplines (possibly in mathematical\nphysics, he thought). When the outside demand for tense logic did\ncome, it was from linguistics (via Montague\u2019s papers, especially\nhis 1970) and from computer science. An early and influential computer\nscience application was by Pnueli, who employed tense logic in formal\nreasoning about the behaviour of concurrent programs (Pnueli 1977).\nPnueli is sometimes mistakenly credited with having originated tense\nlogic, but in fact he first learned of it from the classic 1971 volume\nTemporal Logic by Rescher and Urquhart\n(\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle 1995: 344)\u2014a book dedicated to\nPrior and which is an elegant introduction to his work. The citation\nfor Pnueli\u2019s 1996 A. M. Turing Award begins \u2018For seminal\nwork introducing temporal logic into computing\nscience\u2019. (Goldblatt 1987 surveys the connections between\ntemporal logic and computer science that were emerging during the\ndecade following Pnueli 1997.)\n\n\nPrior would not have been completely surprised to learn how useful\ntense logic has proved to be in computer science. He himself took\nlittle interest in computing, beyond including material on elementary\nboolean circuit theory in his undergraduate lectures, but a number of\nthe logicians with whom he was in touch were more deeply involved (Dov\nGabbay and Dana Scott, for instance). Through others Prior knew\nsomething of the potential. He wrote \u2018There are practical gains\nto be had from this study too, for example in the representation of\ntime-delay in computer circuits\u2019 (1996a: 46). In Past,\nPresent and Future he remarked concerning logics of discrete time\nthat their usefulness \u2018does not depend on any serious\nmetaphysical assumption that time is discrete; they are\napplicable in limited fields of discourse in which we are concerned\nonly with what happens next in a sequence of discrete states, e.g. in\nthe workings of a digital computer\u2019 (1967a: 67). Other logics\nfrom a wide group that Prior and von Wright pioneered are also finding\ncomputational applications, for example epistemic logic in artificial\nintelligence and knowledge-base engineering, and the logic of action in\nprogramming theory. It is pleasant to reflect that two major forces in\nthe genesis of these software technologies were Prior\u2019s love of\nancient and medieval logic and his concern to make conceptual room for\nfreedom of the human will.\n2. Work on Modal Logic\n\n\nOf the four technical papers that marked the explosive beginning of\nPrior\u2019s career as a formal logician in 1952 (1952a-d), two concerned modal\nlogic. \u2018Modality De Dicto and Modality De Re\u2019 is a\ndiscussion of this distinction as it appears in Aristotle, Ockham, and\nPeter of Spain, together with a comparison of these earlier views with\nthose of von Wright in his 1951 book An Essay on Modal Logic. \u2018In What\nSense is Modal Logic Many-Valued?\u2019 concerns\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s four-valued matrices for modal logic. In this\npaper Prior took issue with the view \u2018that the logic of modality\ncannot be satisfactorily studied unless we use a many-valued calculus\nfor its formal expression\u2019, and he proposed a subversive\ninterpretation of the four-valued matrices according to which modal\npropositions remain bivalent. This paper was the curtain raiser to\nPrior\u2019s extensive study of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work on\nmodality, and thereafter he read \u0141ukasiewicz widely\u2014even\nmaterial in Polish, saying \u2018the symbols are so illuminating that\nthe fact that the text is incomprehensible doesn\u2019t much\nmatter\u2019.\n2.1 The Craft of Formal Logic\n\n\nPrior\u2019s entry into modal logic was bound up with his passion for\nancient and early logic. His first essay on the subject, the\npenultimate chapter\u2014\u2018Modality\u2019\u2014of his\nill-fated manuscript The Craft of Formal Logic, is largely\nhistorical in nature, with discussions of Aristotle, Peter of Spain,\nJohn Wallis, the Port Royal Logic, Isaac Watts\u2019\nLogick, Whately, Aldrich, de Morgan, and Hume and Mill on\nnatural necessity. To judge by his references in The Craft,\nhis first encounters with modern symbolic modal logic must have been\nthe pioneering explorations by Lewis in his and Langford\u2019s\nSymbolic Logic, Bochenski\u2019s chapter \u2018La Logique\nde la Modalit\u00e9\u2019 in his La Logique de\nTh\u00e9ophraste, and Feys\u2019 article \u2018Les\nSyst\u00e8mes Formalis\u00e9s des Modalit\u00e9s\nAristot\u00e9liciennes\u2019 (Lewis and Langford 1932, Bochenski\n1947, Feys 1950). Other important early influences were von\nWright\u2019s \u2018Deontic Logic\u2019 and An Essay in Modal\nLogic, both published in 1951. Probably through Bochenski\u2019s\nwritings, Prior had discovered \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work in\nsymbolic modal logic by the time of \u2018In What Sense is Modal\nLogic Many-Valued?\u2019. In that paper Prior focussed on\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s \u2018On Variable Functors of Propositional\nArguments\u2019 (\u0141ukasiewicz 1951b), which he described in a\n1952 review of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s symbolic logic as \u2018quite\nthe most exciting contribution that has been made to symbolic logic in\nEnglish for a very long time\u2019. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work on\nmodality was a major influence on Prior, who wrote in the Preface to\nTime and Modality: \u2018[W]hile I differed radically from\nthe late Professor \u0141ukasiewicz on the subject of modal logic, my\ndebt to him will be obvious on almost every page\u2019.)\nOne of Prior\u2019s conclusions in \u2018Modality\u2019,\nsignificant for his later work, is that \u2018[t]here is everything to\nbe said \u2026 for the \u2026 view that we may not only use devices\ndeveloped in the study of quantity to throw light on modality, but also\nvice versa\u2019 (1951: 747). One of the most distinctive\nfeatures of his mature philosophy was the view that quantification over\npossible worlds and instants is to be interpreted in terms of modality\nand tense, which constitute primitive notions\u2014a view he held in\ntandem with the belief that the study of such quantifications could\nusefully illuminate the study of modality and tense (as in his own\n\\(U\\)-calculi, described below).\n\n\nPrior arrived at another important insight in the penultimate\nchapter of The Craft. Early in 1951 he read von Wright\u2019s\narticle \u2018Deontic Logic\u2019 and in \u2018Modality\u2019 he gave a\ncameo discussion of this area. His reading of von Wright reinforced in\nhis mind an idea that he had come across in Peter of Spain, Isaac\nWatts, and the Port Royal Logic, an idea that was to be of\nconsiderable significance for his own future work. What von Wright\ncalled the \u2018alethic\u2019 modes\u2014necessity, possibility,\nimpossibility and contingency\u2014are members of an extended group of\nconcepts that includes the epistemic modes (\u2018it is known\nthat\u2019, \u2018it is not known to be false that\u2019, etc.), the\ndoxastic modes (such as \u2018it is believed that\u2019), and the\ndeontic modes (which include \u2018it is permitted that\u2019 and\n\u2018it is obligatory that\u2019). In The Craft Prior also\nlisted Watts\u2019 \u2018it is written that\u2019 and \u2018it is\nsaid that\u2019, noting that \u2018one could think of innumerable\nothers\u2019 (1951: 749). Later, von Wright was to draw attention to\nwhat may be called the agentive modes: \u2018the agent brings it about\nthat\u2019, \u2018the agent makes it true that\u2019, and the like\n(von Wright 1963).\n\n\nPrior introduced the collective term \u2018quasi-modals\u2019 for\nthe non-alethic modes (1951: 749) and remarked, accurately, that\n\u2018there is a hint of a large field here\u2019 (1951: 752). He was\nlater to refer to his own tense operators as quasi-modal operators\n(1968: 138). By the time he wrote Formal Logic he was\nadvocating the study of \u2018the general modal form \u201cIt is\n\u2014 that \\(p\\)\u201d \u2026 as a distinct propositional\nform\u2019, observing that \u2018this field has not been much\ncultivated\u2019 (1955a: 218).\n2.2 General Intensional Logic\n\n\nBetween them Prior and von Wright pioneered the now much\ninvestigated field of general intensional logic, in which the syntax,\nand latterly the semantics, developed for the study of the alethic\nmodalities is used in the analysis of a wide range of quasi-modal\nconcepts. Von Wright\u2019s deontic logic and Prior\u2019s tense\nlogic were the first major successes in this field.\n\n\nPrior was convinced that no satisfactory metalinguistic\nanalysis can be given of sentences having the general modal form\n\u2018It is \u2014 that \\(p\\)\u2019. In Formal Logic\nhe wrote: \u2018It is quite plain, for example, that I am not talking\nabout the sentence \u201cSocrates is dead\u201d when I say \u201cI\nwish that Socrates were dead\u201d\u2019 (1955a: 219). In Time\nand Modality he reiterated the point, now in connection with the\ntenses: \u2018\u201cProfessor Carnap will be flying to the\nmoon\u201d \u2026 is quite obviously a statement about Professor\nCarnap, and quite obviously not a statement about the statement\n\u201cProfessor Carnap is flying to the moon\u201d\u2019 (1957:\n8).\n\n\nWhat, then, is the semantic value of an expression replacing\n\\(p\\) in a sentence of the general modal form \u2018It is \u2014\nthat \\(p\\)\u2019? Certainly not a truth value, as is the case\nwith the standard extensional propositional calculus, for substituting\na different expression with the same truth value into the sentence of\nthe form \u2018It is \u2014 that \\(p\\)\u2019 may alter the\ntruth value of the latter sentence. Prior\u2019s answer\u2014and in a\nsense it amounts to a rejection of the question\u2014is that modal\nfunctions take propositions as arguments, but propositions are logical\nconstructions. All sentences containing the word\n\u2018proposition\u2019\u2014including such sentences as \u2018A\nmodal operator expresses a function from propositions to truth\nvalues\u2019\u2014mean no more and no less than sentences which\ncontain neither the word \u2018proposition\u2019 nor an equivalent.\nIn essence, Prior\u2019s view is that there are intensional contexts\nbut no intensions. For the last six years of his life he worked on a\nbook that was to give systematic expression to his views on\npropositions. The incomplete manuscript, which Prior had entitled\nObjects of Thought, was published posthumously in 1971.\n2.3 Prior and Possible Worlds Semantics\n\n\nPrior\u2019s detailed contributions to the development of modal\nlogic are legion. At least one aspect of his work has not received the\nrecognition it deserves. Several years ahead of Kripke, Prior and his\ncollaborator Carew Meredith invented crucial elements of the possible\nworlds semantics for propositional modal logic, including the\nall-important binary relation, which opens the way to modelling systems\nof different strengths. Meredith was a lecturer in mathematics at\nTrinity College, Dublin; his interest in logic had been stimulated by\nthe arrival of \u0141ukasiewicz in Dublin shortly after the second\nworld war.\n\n\nPrior foreshadowed his later work on possible worlds semantics in\nThe Craft. Discussing work by Boole, he wrote:\n\n\n\nWhat Boole was after might perhaps have been plainer if he had said\nsomething like this: There is one \u2018hypothetical Universe\u2019,\nwhich contains the totality of what we might call possibilities, or if\nyou like, \u2018possible worlds\u2019. (1951: 462.)\n\n\n\nThen in the penultimate chapter of The Craft he said:\n\n\n\nFor the similarity in behaviour between signs of modality and signs\nof quantity, various explanations may be offered. It may be, for\nexample, that signs of modality are just ordinary quantifiers operating\nupon a peculiar subject-matter, namely possible states of affairs\n\u2026 It would not be quite accurate to describe theories of this\nsort as \u2018reducing modality to quantity\u2019. They do reduce\nmodal distinctions to distinctions of quantity, but the\nvariables to which the quantifiers are attached retain something modal\nin their signification \u2014 they signify\n\u2018possibilities\u2019, \u2018chances\u2019, \u2018possible\nstates of affairs\u2019, \u2018possible combinations of\ntruth-values\u2019, or the like. (1951: 736\u20137.)\n\n\n\nAs sources for these ideas Prior cited John Wallis (a seventeenth\ncentury mathematician) and the account of logically necessary and\nlogically impossible propositions given by Wittgenstein in the\nTractatus (1951: 737). Interestingly, he mentioned Carnap only\nin a footnote: \u2018Professor Carnap has a similar definition of\nlogical necessity in terms of what he calls\n\u201cstate-descriptions\u201d\u2019 (ibid). Prior did not refer to,\nand presumably had not at that time read, Carnap\u2019s 1946 paper\n\u2018Modalities and Quantification\u2019, which attempted a\nsemantics for quantified S5 in terms of state-descriptions. (A\nstate-description is a class of sentences satisfying certain\nconditions; each state-description represents a possible state of\naffairs.) Carnap too cited the Tractatus account of modal\npropositions as his inspiration (1946: 47).\n\n\nPrior goes on in The Craft to defend his account of\nmodality as quantification over possible states of affairs against\nvarious alternatives, for example the Andersonian account, according to\nwhich \u2018Every table here is necessarily brown\u2019 means\n\u2018There is a property which every table here in fact possesses,\nand of which it is true that everything that possesses it is in fact\nbrown\u2019. John Anderson, Professor at the University of Sydney, was\na leading figure in the development of philosophy in Australasia.\n\n\nIn 1956 Prior wrote up (and circulated in mimeograph form) his and\nMeredith\u2019s formal work on what he later described (1962a: 140) as\nthe \u2018logic of world-accessibility\u2019, in a paper entitled\n\u2018Interpretations of Different Modal Logics in the \u201cProperty\nCalculus\u201d\u2019 (Meredith and Prior 1956, first published in\nCopeland 1996). It carried the attribution \u2018C.A.M., August 1956;\nrecorded and expanded A.N.P.\u2019. Prior mentioned this paper in\nPast, Present and Future (1967: 42\u20135) and in his 1962 articles\n\u2018Possible Worlds\u2019 and \u2018Tense-Logic and the Continuity\nof Time\u2019. The paper seems to have been the earliest to employ a\nbinary relation between points in order to discriminate between S5 and\nweaker systems, the points being regarded as possible states of\naffairs. Carnap\u2019s pioneering 1946 paper concerned only S5 and\ncontained no such relation.\n\n\nThe property calculus is essentially a variation of Prior\u2019s\n1954 \\(l\\)-calculus described above. In the \\(l\\)-calculus,\ntense-modal propositions are treated as predicates expressing\nproperties of dates, and quantification theory is supplemented with\nvarious special axioms for a binary relation \u2018\\(l\\)\u2019\ntaking dates as arguments. In the modal version of the calculus,\nsentences of modal logic are treated as if they express properties of\ncertain objects \\(a, b, c\\), etc. Objects are\nrelated by a binary relation \\(U\\). In their 1956 paper Prior and\nMeredith supplied no account of what a formula of form\n\u2018\\(Uab\\)\u2019 might express. They gave the following\ndefinitions of necessity \\(\\Box\\) and possibility \\(\\Diamond\\), where\n\u2018\\(pa\\)\u2019 indicates that object \\(a\\) has the\nproperty expressed by the sentence \\(p\\).\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\Box p)a &= \\forall x(Uax \\rightarrow px) \\\\\n(\\Diamond p)a &= \\exists x(Uax \\amp px).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n(Following \u0141ukasiewicz, Prior and Meredith themselves used\n\u2018L\u2019 in place of \u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 and \u2018M\u2019\nin place of \u2018\\(\\Diamond\\)\u2019.) Their calculus consisted of ordinary\nquantification theory supplemented by these definitions, together with\ncertain axioms governing the relation \\(U\\)\u2014see\nbelow\u2014and the following clauses:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\neg p)a &= \\neg (pa) \\\\\n(p \\rightarrow q)a &= (pa) \\rightarrow (qa). \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nIt is implied in the 1956 paper that a proposition \\(p\\) is to\nbe called a theorem of the calculus if and only if \\(pa\\) is\nprovable for an arbitrarily chosen object \\(a\\).\n\n\nAxioms for \\(U\\) are selected from a list containing (among\nothers):\n\n\n\n1. \\(Uaa\\) \\((U\\) is reflexive)\n\n\n2. \\(Uab \\rightarrow (Ubc \\rightarrow Uac)\\)\n(\\(U\\) is transitive)\n\n\n3. \\(Uab \\rightarrow Uba\\) (\\(U\\) is symmetrical).\n\n\n\nAxiom 2 was also present in the 1954 \\(l\\)-calculus.\n\n\nPrior and Meredith stated in their 1956 paper that the distribution\nprinciple \\(\\Box(p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow \n(\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box q)\\) is a theorem in the\nabsence of any special axioms for \\(U\\); that \\(\\Box p \\rightarrow p\\) is a theorem if axiom 1 is imposed; that axiom 2\ngives the S4 principle \\(\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box \\Box p\\); and that 2 together with 3 give the S5\nprinciple \\(\\Diamond \\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box p\\). Their\napproach was proof-theoretic in its basic orientation and they offered\nno completeness results. In (1962a) and (1962b) Prior extended this\napproach to systems between S4 and S5, and to systems independent of S4\nbetween T and S5.\n\n\nWhat of the meaning of the binary relation \\(U\\)? As previously\nremarked, the idea that the variables of quantification of the calculus\nshould range over possible states of affairs or possible worlds is\npresent in The Craft. In 1960, following a suggestion by\nGeach, Prior began thinking of \\(U\\) as a relation of\naccessibility between worlds. Prior tells us that Geach cashed\nout the notion of \u2018reaching\u2019 one world from another in\nterms of \u2018some dimension-jumping vehicle dreamed up by science\nfiction\u2019 (1962b: 36; see also 1962a: 140). (Geach referred to the\nwhole business as \u2018Trans World Airlines\u2019.) With this\ninterpretation of \\(U\\) to hand, the property calculus can be\nviewed as treating \\((\\Box p)a\\) \u2014 or\n\u2018Necessarily\\(-p\\) in world \\(a\\)\u2019 \u2014 as\nshort for \u2018\\(p\\) is true in all worlds accessible from\n\\(a\\)\u2019.\n\n\nLemmon, in a draft of material intended for his and Dana\nScott\u2019s projected book \u2018Intensional Logic\u2019,\nmistakenly credited Geach with the idea that the binary relation\n\u2018may be intuitively thought of as a relation between possible\nworlds\u2019. In a letter to Scott, written after Lemmon\u2019s death\nin 1966, Prior remarked: \u2018What Geach contributed was not the\ninterpretation of \\([U]\\) as a relation between worlds (God knows\nwhen that started), but the interpretation of \\([U]\\) as\na relation of accessibility\u2019. When Prior said \u2018God knows\nwhen that started\u2019 he was presumably referring to the\nidea that the \u2018objects\u2019 of the calculus be regarded as\npossible worlds. He was right to think that the history of this idea is\na tangled one. Priority is often assigned to Leibniz, but scholars have\ntraced the idea back to Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (Knuuttila\n1993).\n\n\nIt seems that the binary relation first made its appearance in a\n1951 article by Jonsson and Tarski, \u2018Boolean Algebras with\nOperators\u2019. In their Theorem 3.14 they established that every\nclosure algebra is isomorphic to an algebraic system formed by a set\nand a reflexive and transitive relation between its elements; their\nTheorem 3.5 considered also a symmetry condition. In hindsight, these\ntheorems (which explicitly concerned boolean algebras) can be viewed as\nin effect a treatment of all the basic modal axioms and corresponding\nproperties of the accessibility relation. Concerning this article, Saul\nKripke remarked (in Copeland 1996: 13):\n\n\n\nHad they known they were doing modal logic, they would have had the\ncompleteness problem for many of the modal propositional systems\nwrapped up, and some powerful theorems. Mathematically they did this,\nbut it was presented as algebra with no mention of semantics, modal\nlogic, or possible worlds, let alone quantifiers. When I presented my\npaper at the conference in Finland in 1962, I emphasized the importance\nof this paper. Tarski was present, and said that he was unable to see\nany connection with what I was doing!\n\n\n\nDuring the next eight years the binary relation was reinvented by a\nnumber of logicians. Prior, in his address to a conference in\nWellington in 1954, seems to have been the first to use the binary\nrelation in an explicitly tense-modal context. Other landmarks were an\naddress by Montague to a conference held at UCLA in 1955\n(Montague\u2019s binary relation held between models rather than\npoints or indices interpretable as worlds, and the notion of a possible\nworld was absent), Prior and Meredith\u2019s property calculus of\n1956, lectures by Smiley in Cambridge in 1957 (Smiley pursued an\nalgebraic approach), Kanger (1957), Hintikka (1957, 1961) and Kripke\n(1959a, 1959b, 1963). Kripke was familiar with Kanger\u2019s work\ninvolving the binary relation at the time he obtained his own results.\nKanger himself had read the 1951 paper by Jonsson and Tarski and he\ndescribed his results as similar to theirs (Kanger 1957: 39). (Copeland\n(2002) gives a detailed history of possible worlds semantics.)\n\n\nTo the modern eye, Prior\u2019s 1956 possible worlds semantics looks\nfamiliar yet also strange. There is no semantic ascent, and there are\nno frames, models, valuations, satisfaction clauses or truth\nconditions. Prior\u2019s modal semantics belongs to a pre-modern era,\nthe era of \u2018translational\u2019 semantics, a type of semantics\nthat pre-dated the meteoric rise of Tarski-style truth-conditional\nsemantics in the 1960s and 1970s (Copeland 2016). A translational\nsemantics translates the targeted sentences into a more illuminating\nlanguage, such as Prior\u2019s enriched predicate calculus. For\nanyone who understands Prior\u2019s augmented predicate calculus, his\ntranslational clauses, such as \\((\\Diamond p)a = \\exists x(Uax \\amp\npx),\\) offer both an explanation of the meanings of the modal\noperators and an account of how the meanings of complex sentences\n(e.g. the S4 and S5 axioms) arise recursively from the meanings of\ntheir parts.\n2.4 Prior and Kripke\n\n\nKripke first became interested in modal logic in 1956, as a result\nof reading Prior\u2019s paper \u2018Modality and Quantification in\nS5\u2019 (Prior 1956a). Kripke was at this time still at high school,\nworking on logic in almost complete isolation in Omaha, Nebraska. In\n1958, he read Time and Modality and was impressed by the\nparallel Prior drew between tense and the alethic modalities.\n\n\nAt almost exactly the same time, Prior was reading Kripke\u2019s\nfirst paper, \u2018A Completeness Theorem in Modal Logic\u2019\n(Kripke 1959a), in his capacity as referee for the Journal of\nSymbolic Logic. In this paper Kripke stated and proved a\ncompleteness theorem for an extension of S5 with quantifiers and\nidentity; the binary relation made no appearance. His first publication\nto mention the binary relation\u2014which he interpreted as a relation\nof relative possibility between worlds\u2014was written in 1962 and\nappeared in 1963 (Kripke 1963); the paper contained completeness proofs\nfor propositional \\(M\\), S4, \\(B\\), and S5. Kripke reported\n(in correspondence with Copeland) that the idea of the binary relation\noccurred to him much earlier than 1962, in fact shortly after his paper\non S5 was first submitted in the spring of 1958.\n\n\nBy the late summer of 1958, Kripke had a completeness result for S4.\nOn 3 September 1958 he wrote to Prior, mentioning his work on\nsemantical completeness theorems for quantified extensions of S4 with\nand without the Barcan formula (Marcus 1946, 1962). (Prior himself had\nalready given an early counterexample to the Barcan formula in a\ntense-modal context (Prior 1957: 26, Copeland 2016).) In his September\nletter, Kripke gave a branching-time matrix, characteristic for S4.\nThis is essentially a tense-logical interpretation of the reflexivity +\ntransitivity semantics for S4. He wrote:\n\n\n\nin an indetermined system, we perhaps should not regard time as a\nlinear series, as you have done. Given the present moment, there are\nseveral possibilities for what the next moment may be like\u2014and\nfor each possible next moment, there are several possibilities for the\nmoment after that. Thus the situation takes the form, not of a linear\nsequence, but of a \u2018tree\u2019.\n\n\n\n(Some of the Kripke\u2013Prior correspondence is now published in\nPloug and \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2012.)\n\n\nThere was a two-way traffic of ideas. A constant domain was assumed\nin Kripke\u2019s 1959 \u2018A Completeness Theorem in Modal\nLogic\u2019, and Kripke suspects that Time and Modality first\ninterested him in the problem of treating variable domains. He worked\non Prior\u2019s suggestion\u2014formalised in Prior\u2019s system\n\\(Q\\)\u2014that variable domains might lead to truth-value gaps\neven at the level of propositional logic, although Kripke did not\npursue this approach in his published material. Further, Kripke thinks\nit probable that Prior\u2019s work on many-valued matrices in Time\nand Modality gave him the idea of converting possible worlds\nmodels into many-valued matrices, an approach he followed in his 1963\npaper \u2018Semantical Analysis of Modal Logic I: Normal Modal\nPropositional Calculi\u2019.\n3. Life and Philosophical Development\n3.1 Launching Out\n\n\nIn 1932, at the age of 17, Prior left his home town, sleepy\nMasterton in the North Island of New Zealand, to become a student at\nthe University of Otago in the South Island city of Dunedin. He seemed\nto prefer the South Island, saying the North Island gave him \u2018the\nwillies\u2019. The son of a doctor, he initially planned a career as a\nbiologist, but was soon beckoned away by theology and philosophy,\ngraduating from Otago in 1935 with a B.A. in philosophy. At Otago he\nhad thoughts of entering the ministry of the Presbyterian Church, and\nhe was accepted into the required program of study. \u2018Who\u2019,\nhe had asked himself in a 1931 manuscript, \u2018are the greatest\nthinkers the world has known?\u2019\u2014answering \u2018I have no\nhesitation in placing JESUS OF NAZARETH at the top of this list\u2019\n(Prior 1931: 107). In 1936, he abandoned the idea of entering the\nministry, although he did subsequently work for a time as a locum\nminister in Birmingham, England, during his \u2018bohemian\nperiod\u2019 at the end of the 1930s.\n\n\nIt was John Findlay, Professor of Philosophy at Otago, who\nintroduced Prior to logic. Findlay, a contemporary of Gilbert Ryle and\nWilliam Kneale, had studied at Oxford and at Graz; his influential book\nMeinong\u2019s Theory of Objects and Values was published\nduring Prior\u2019s second year at Otago. Under Findlay\u2019s\ndirection, Prior studied the 18th century British moralists\nand cut his teeth on W.E. Johnson\u2019s classic text Logic.\nIt was Findlay who first aroused his interest in the history of logic.\nIn correspondence, Prior described Findlay\u2019s Otago lectures as\n\u2018thrilling\u2019, and remarked that his offprint of\nFindlay\u2019s 1936 article \u2018Relational Properties\u2019 was\none of his \u2018most valued literary possessions\u2019. In 1949 he\nwrote of Findlay, \u2018I owe to his teaching, directly or indirectly,\nalmost all that I know of either Logic or Ethics\u2019 (1949: xi), and\nhe was later generously to describe Findlay as \u2018the founding\nfather of modern tense-logic\u2019 (1967a: 1).\n\n\nIn 1936, the year following his graduation, Prior married. It was a\nwhirlwind romance. In a letter written at the beginning of June 1936,\nhe said he was \u2018taking an interest in a rather desperate & in\nsome ways rather dangerous little friend\u2019, adding that he had\nbeen solemnly advised \u2018not to fall in love\u2019 with her. The\nrather dangerous Clare Hunter, an up-and-coming freelance reporter for\nthe Otago Daily Times, was a feminist and free thinker. She\nencouraged Prior in what he called his \u2018innate\nBohemianism\u2019. Before July was out, the two were planning to\n\u2018get quietly married at the end of the year\u2019, wrote Prior.\nThis must soon have seemed too long a wait, for they wed the very next\nmonth. (There is a thumbnail biography of Hunter in Grimshaw\n(2018).)\n\n\nPrior gained his M.A. in philosophy in 1937. His thesis, criticizing\nvarious philosophical approaches to logic, involved him in reading\n\u2018a lot about Wittgenstein & certain kindred writers\u2019,\nincluding Karl Popper. But the thesis was awarded only a second by the\nexternal examiner. Fortunately, Findlay knew a budding logician when he\nsaw one, and secured Prior a one-year assistant lectureship at Otago.\nDuring the 1937 academic year Prior gave courses on logic, ethics, and\nprobability theory. Findlay pressed him to contribute to the\nAustralasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy, and\nPrior\u2019s \u2018The Nation and the Individual\u2019 (influenced\nby John Wisdom) became his first published paper in philosophy, in\nDecember 1937. (Prior\u2019s earlier theological writings are\ndiscussed in Hasle (1999) and (2012), Grimshaw (2002), and Jakobsen\n(2012) and (2016).) Prior mentioned \u2018The Nation and the\nIndividual\u2019 and its origins in a 1937 letter:\n\n\n\nThe view of Philosophy as \u2018analysis\u2019 (to which\nWittgenstein & co. have made important contributions) has proved\nremarkably fruitful in the fields of Logic, Ethics, Physics, Psychology\n& Metaphysics; but I would like to see it applied\u2014& I\nthink it is capable of very fruitful application\u2014in Theology,\nSociology, Economics & Political Ethics. \u2026 I\u2019m\n\u2026 trying a little work along those lines at present\nmyself\u2014figuring out the consequences of treating a Nation as what\nthese champions of \u2018Analysis\u2019 call a \u2018logical\nconstruction\u2019.\n\n3.2 Religious Journalist\n\n\nAt the end of 1937 Prior set aside thoughts of an academic career\n\nand travelled to Europe with Clare, spending three bohemian years\n\nthere. They planned to earn a living from freelance writing; Arthur\n\nwanted to gain \u2018a footing in the English literary world\u2019\n(as he wrote to the New Zealand poet Ursula Bethell), and said he had\n\u2018hopes of ending up eventually as the editor of a religious\nperiodical\u2019. This interlude in Europe, and its aftermath in New\nZealand, was a critical period in Prior\u2019s development\u2014the\ncrucible in which the mature thinker was formed. His social and\npolitical philosophy settled firmly to the far left, but ultimately\nfell short of Marxism; his pacifism escalated, only to be overturned by\nworld events; and his theism began to wane into unbelief.\n\n\nJanuary 1938 saw the couple boarding the Orient Line\u2019s S.S.\nOrmonde in Sydney, carrying large rucksacks. The\nOrmonde was bound for London via Colombo, Suez, Naples and\nToulon. In Colombo, Prior took the opportunity to visit \u2018a Hindoo\ntemple, a Buddhist one, a Mahommedan mosque, a Roman Catholic church\n& an Anglican church\u2019. He was, at this stage of his life,\nobsessed with religion. He believed in the virgin birth and the voice\nof the devil, and was a devout Presbyterian (Prior 1940). His\nimpressions after his first encounter with extreme religious diversity\nwere, he said, \u2018very vivid, but very confused\u2019. He\ndescribed the Anglican church as \u2018a foreign growth\u2019, and\nwhat he called \u2018the R. C. place\u2019 was, he said, not\n\u2018sufficiently distinguishable from the idolatries around\nit\u2019. He decided that \u2018Buddhism was a much saner sort of\nreligion than either Hinduism or Mohammedanism\u2019, and that\n\u2018the Mahommedans are a particularly arrogant crowd, &\nobviously think they\u2019re the lords of creation\u2019.\n\n\nPrior mused in a letter, \u2018Ought I not to be trying to do a bit\nof \u201cwitnessing\u201d to these crowds of heathen?\u2019 Several\nof his early publications were given over to propounding the Christian\nmessage: the Christian God, he wrote, is \u2018the Lord God\nOmnipotent, the High and Holy One who inhabiteth ETERNITY, absolutely\nindependent of all being other than himself, and Creator, Lord and\nJudge of all\u2019 (Prior 1934).\n\n\nIn later life, however, he described himself as having \u2018no\nreligious beliefs\u2019 (Prior c.1967). In 1961, when Max\nCresswell\u2014then a logic student aged 21\u2014met him for the\nfirst time, in Manchester, Prior announced: \u2018Mr Cresswell,\nisn\u2019t it a pity that God does not exist\u2019.\n3.3 First Taste of Europe\n\n\nThe Priors disembarked from the Ormonde in France. They\nplanned to sleep out, but with winter fading into spring they soon\ntired of it, and moved into a small apartment in the village of\nRoquebrune, on the south coast. They ended up staying several months.\nArthur liked France, saying \u2018It\u2019s the Reddest country\nwe\u2019ve been in so far\u2019. Clare worked as a baker in a cake\nshop while Arthur translated essays by the French philosopher Georges\nSorel. They swelled their meagre income by gambling at nearby Monte\nCarlo. \u2018[W]e play very cautiously\u2019, Arthur\nsaid\u2014\u2018we\u2019re a few hundred francs up\u2019.\n\n\nA short visit across the border to Hitler\u2019s Germany left Prior\naghast. \u2018We got out of the place as fast as we could\u2019, he\nsaid: \u2018the general mental atmosphere is just one big Hell\u2019.\nAt Roquebrune he met a young German backpacker, a Lutheran, pleasant\nand mild of manner, according to Prior, but pro-Hitler and virulently\nanti-Jewish\u2014the German responded with \u2018a queer look\u2019\nwhen Prior \u2018told him that if I was in Germany I would be a member\nof the Bekenntniskirche\u2019, the anti-Hitler, Barth-inclined German\nConfessional Church. The Priors also visited Austria, not long after\nthe March 1938 Anschluss (union) with Germany. Horrified by\nthe rampant anti-semitism they found there, they wrote an article about\nthe plight of the Austrian Jews for the Otago Daily Times,\nunder Clare\u2019s nom de plume \u2018John Everdean\u2019. They\nreported that posters bearing slogans like \u2018You will never get\nclean milk if you get it from Jews\u2019 were ruining Jewish\nbusinesses, and Jewish shops had a \u2018dirty yellow placard pasted\nacross the door\u2019, warning customers away (Everdean 1938).\n\n\nPrior anticipated his arrival in England with mixed feelings. He had\nexperienced the English at close quarters aboard the Ormonde:\nthey \u2018stink with Race Prejudice\u2019, he wrote. His experiences\non the boat had he said taught him that he liked \u2018Americans\nbetter than Englishmen\u2019\u2014and \u2018Australians better than\nNew Zealanders\u2019. It was in the early summer of 1938 that the\ncouple crossed the English Channel and settled in London. Whether the\nreality was better or worse than Prior\u2019s expectations is hard to\nsay. He certainly found \u2018abominable race-prejudice\u2019, and\npolitically there was also \u2018plenty to disgust us\u2019\u2014as\nwell as \u2018the extraordinary backwardness of England as compared\nwith N.Z.\u2019.\n\n\n\u2018England\u2019s a country that fills one with a kind of\nimpotent and maddening despair\u2019, he said. But he also emphasized\nthat \u2018London is the place to meet worth-while\npeople\u2019, saying not very long after he arrived, \u2018We have so\nfar been much more \u201csuccessful\u201d in London than we ever\nexpected\u2019. There was also a disappointment awaiting him: the SCM\nPress had declined a book manuscript on theologian Karl Barth he had\nsent to them just before leaving New Zealand. Next he tried T. & T.\nClark, but the book never did see the light of day.\n\n\nPrior was soon contributing reviews to a handful of magazines,\nincluding The Student Movement and the left-wing feminist\nweekly Time and Tide. The snag was that his work was usually\nunpaid\u2014but he was allowed to keep the books he reviewed and he\nsold them at half-price. Things looked up when T. S. Eliot gave him a\n\u2018decent payment\u2019 for two reviews in the literary magazine\nThe Criterion. (Prior found Eliot \u2018decidedly on the old\nside\u2019 and \u2018very shy & quiet\u2019.) But money was\nalways tight. Eventually Clare started taking in typing and Arthur\nfound temporary clerical work in the Examinations Department of London\nUniversity (Prior 1941).\n3.4 Politics\n\n\nAt first, the Priors lived in a handsome Georgian hotel close to the\nfamous libraries of the British Museum and University College, but they\nquickly moved into cheaper accommodation in Lambeth. They were a short\nstroll from the bustling working-class street market of Lambeth Walk,\nand not far from overcrowded and insanitary slums. No doubt Lambeth\nreinforced the views Arthur had expressed the year before in the\nOtago Daily Times, under the pseudonym \u2018Independent\nLabour\u2019: \u2018We must all fight either with the wage-earners\nfor a society of wage-earners or with the profit-seekers for a society\nof profit-seekers\u2019. For Arthur the \u2018fundamental\nquestion\u2019 was: \u2018Are the workers going to group together to\norganise and undertake their own enterprise, or are they going to be at\nthe beck and call of a privileged class\u2019 (Prior 1937a).\n\n\nHe saw London through socialist eyes. The streets \u2018are full of\nbeggars\u2019, he wrote to his cousin Hugh Teague: \u2018blind men,\nparalytics, pavement artists, organ grinders, Welsh miners\u2019. He\ngave the Red salute to the miners (who were fleeing in their thousands\nfrom devastating unemployment in Wales) and found they returned it\n\u2018with great gusto\u2019. The previous year he described his\n\u2018thinking on social questions\u2019 as owing \u2018a great\ndeal\u2019 to the Trotskyist writings of Auckland philosopher William\nAnderson and also to the writings of the Marxist-Leninist thinker\nSorel, whose essays he translated at Roquebrune. He said he learned\nmore from Sorel \u2018than from any other Marxist\ntheoreticians\u2019. Like Sorel, he saw the importance of \u2018the\nsubstitution of a \u201cproducer-mentality\u201d for an\n\u201cemployee-mentality\u201d among the workers\u2019:\nEngland\u2019s problems, Prior said, included the \u2018servility of\nthe English masses\u2019 and \u2018their almost unbounded willingness\nto \u201ckeep their place\u201d\u2019.\n\n\nHe told Hugh: \u2018I personally get much the same kind of\n\u201ckick\u201d out of reading Lenin at his best, as I do out of\nreading some of the tough & argumentative old Scottish\nCalvinists\u2014John Knox and the rest\u2019. Prior remained strongly\nleft-wing for the rest of his life, but his flirtation with communism\nwas over by 1946. In that year he wrote to his friend Lex Miller,\nsaying he had been \u2018released\u2019 from \u2018a sort of complex\nthat I have had about Marxism right up till now, a kind of inward\nbondage to it despite all my points of difference from it, based on the\nfeeling that though its philosophy might be abominable its economics\nwere unanswerable.\u2019\n\n\nAs Prior explained to Miller, he now saw that \u2018the Marxists\nwere guilty of an economic fallacy\u2019:\n\n\n\nall this business about capitalism involving a\n\u2018contradiction\u2019 seems to be just hooey \u2026 I write, of\ncourse, with the zeal of a convert; or more accurately with the\nindignation of a man who has just discovered that he has been\nhoodwinked for years.\n\n\n\nIn February 1939, Arthur summed up his and Clare\u2019s situation\nin London: \u2018I\u2019m afraid we haven\u2019t acclimatised\nourselves to the ways of England\u2019, he wrote: \u2018We\u2019ve\nno desire to be back in N.Z., but there\u2019s a lot over here that\nit\u2019s hard to stomach\u2019. Worse, war was approaching. During\nthe Munich crisis, in the autumn of the previous year, Clare had\nwatched sandbag air-raid shelters being constructed across London, and\nshe saw long queues everywhere as people waited to get gas masks\nfitted. She was (she wrote) \u2018half-expecting to hear any moment\nthe noise of thunder as planes filled the air\u2019 (Everdean\n1938a).\n\n\nHitler invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939, and in July Arthur\nwrote about the plight of Czech refugees in the weekly newspaper\nThe Christian World (Prior 1939). The Priors had been involved\nfor some time in aiding refugees, and they applied for a job that\nArthur called \u2018tutor-&-mother-superior\u2019 at a small\nhostel in the East End, caring for Jewish children fleeing Austria. It\nwas, he said, \u2018a very bitter disappointment\u2019 when they did\nnot get the job.\n\n\nAs Europe sank into war, the Priors were ardent pacifists. Not long\nafter their visits to Germany and Austria, and as the Spanish Civil War\nraged, they joined the pacifist organisation Pax. New Zealand writer\nDan Davin\u2014who described the prewar Prior as resembling Welsh poet\nDylan Thomas\u2014spent some time with him in Oxford during the weeks\nbefore Britain\u2019s declaration of war on Germany, saying that Prior\nwould argue for long hours about pacifism in Oxford\u2019s \u2018Lamb\n& Flag\u2019 pub (Kenny 1971).\n\n\nWhen Britain finally lurched onto a war footing in September 1939,\nPrior found doubts about his pacifism creeping in: \u2018I must\nconfess my pacifism was a little shaky round about that time\u2019, he\nwrote in December. \u2018I was sure enough of my own duty not to join\nup, but was hesitant to condemn the whole business\u2019.\n3.5 Personal Courage, Bleak Times\n\n\nDuring the first months of 1940 Prior worked on what he described as\n\u2018a large book, on \u201cThe Theology of the Church of\nScotland\u201d\u2019. Life in London went on almost normally during\nthis time of Phoney War, but the situation worsened dramatically after\nthe fall of France in June. A German invasion of Britain seemed\nimminent. Chillingly, Winston Churchill warned of the coming fighting\n\u2018in the fields and in the streets\u2019 (Churchill 1940/2007).\nFor the Priors, it was time to go home.\n\n\nOnce back on New Zealand soil, Prior met with criticism and\nhostility for failing to stay and play his part in the war. But the\njourney home was certainly no cowardly retreat: more than 12,000 miles\nof unfriendly ocean lay between the Priors and New Zealand. At the\nbeginning of August 1940, in Glasgow, they boarded an armed New Zealand\nliner, the MV Rangitiki, bound for Wellington via the Panama\nCanal. Their route lay across the North Atlantic, where German\nsubmarines and aircraft had sunk a total of 81 civilian vessels during\nthe preceding two months, with a further 144 civilian vessels going\ndown in British coastal waters in the same period (Roskill 1954). There\nwere also armed German surface vessels preying on shipping in the\nwaters around New Zealand, even laying minefields in the approaches\n(Waters 1956). During June\u2013August these armed raiders sank\nseveral defenceless ships close to New Zealand\u2014news that, like\nnews of the Atlantic sinkings, could hardly have failed to reach the\nPriors. All in all, it must have been a nerve-racking journey.\n\n\nLuckily the voyage passed without incident, and in September the\nPriors disembarked from the Rangitiki in Wellington. The ship\nwas not so fortunate on her return journey to England, when she was\nattacked by a German battleship in the North Atlantic\u2014in the same\nmonth that her sister liner the Rangitane was sunk while also\nen route from New Zealand to the UK. It had been a narrow escape for\nthe Priors. As they started to pick up the threads of life in\nWellington, the Luftwaffe\u2019s bombs devastated their previous home\nof Lambeth.\n\n\nThe couple took an apartment in central Wellington, and in October\nArthur started teaching French, English and History at a secondary\nschool in the suburb of Rongotai. He gave this up in March 1941 and the\nPriors returned to Dunedin, joining the household of fellow pacifists\nJack Brailsford and his wife Ruth\u2014Arthur\u2019s \u2018Aunty\nRuth\u2019, who had cared for him when his mother died not long after\nhis birth. Jack, a conscientious objector in the first world war, had\nbeen imprisoned for his pacifism in 1916 and was not released until\njust before the end of the fighting in 1918 (Brodie 1999).\n\n\nIt was while the Priors were living with the Brailsfords that Clare\nfell for their adopted Russian son Victor Roussin\u2014at that time\nknown as Norman Brailsford\u2014and her marriage to Arthur\ndisintegrated. Arthur, who did not want the relationship to end,\neventually fled to Christchurch. The divorce became final in March\n1943. What might have been a lengthy period of sadness for him was cut\nshort in January of that year. He met Mary Wilkinson, the daughter of a\nPresbyterian minister, while attending a Student Christian Movement\nconference in Christchurch. They said afterwards that it was love at\nfirst sight. \u2018We got engaged after meeting four times\u2019,\nMary remembered. The marriage began in October 1943 and lasted for the\nrest of Arthur\u2019s life.\n\n\nDuring 1941 Arthur had come to view his pacifism as untenable,\nthough in December he wrote two letters to the Otago Daily\nTimes defending \u2018liberty of conscience\u2019 and the right\nto be a conscientious objector. In January 1942, while he and Clare\nwere still living with the Brailsfords in Dunedin, Arthur was called\nup, and instead of appealing for conscientious objector status himself,\nhe applied to enlist in the Royal New Zealand Air Force (perhaps\nbecause, under the regulations in force at that time, such an appeal\nwould have required him to say \u2018that it is wrong to engage in\nwarfare in any circumstances\u2019). There is no evidence that\nClare\u2019s pacifism had also weakened, and Arthur\u2019s thinking\nwas manifestly undergoing other fundamental changes at this time. His\nenlistment papers contained the brief but telling entry\n\u2018Religion: Atheist\u2019. It seems that a philosophical and\nspiritual chasm had opened up between him and Clare.\n\n\nThe Air Force finally embraced him in November 1942 and he became a\nwireless mechanic, servicing aircraft radio equipment in New Zealand\nuntil January 1945, when he was posted to the New Hebrides islands (now\nVanuatu), some 2000 miles to the north of New Zealand. There he\nremained until the Pacific war ended, returning to New Zealand in\nOctober 1945.\n3.6 New Man\n\n\nWith his second marriage, Prior changed. He became \u2018secure and\nserene\u2019 (Kenny 1971). The rather priggish young man disappears\nfrom his letters and a more mature, more lovable Prior emerges. In\nNovember 1945, he applied for a temporary lectureship at Canterbury\nUniversity College, in Christchurch, a vacancy created by\nPopper\u2019s departure. By now he had a further three articles in the\nAustralasian Journal of Psychology and\nPhilosophy\u2014\u2018Can Religion be Discussed?\u2019 (1942),\n\u2018The Meaning of Good\u2019 (1944), and \u2018The Subject of\nEthics\u2019 (1945)\u2014and with a strong recommendation from\nFindlay, he got the job. Prior started work in February 1946, on a\nsalary of \u00a3600 a year. It was a new beginning.\n\n\nAt Canterbury he was thrown entirely on his own resources, being as\nhe put it \u2018the only philosopher about the place\u2019. Prior\nbore the responsibility for providing a broad and balanced philosophy\ncurriculum, yet his own formal education in philosophy had stopped\nshort nine years previously. His one recourse in the face of isolation\nwas to read, and read he did. In logic he began by returning to W.E.\nJohnson. Next came J.N. Keynes\u2019s Studies and Exercises in\nFormal Logic and then (in his own phrase) he got stuck into\nPrincipia Mathematica. He learned a lot about the history of\nthe subject from Peirce, whom he found \u2018unexpectedly\nmagnificent\u2019. An important discovery, in 1950, was\nBochenski\u2019s Pr\u00e9cis de Logique Mathematique\n(Bochenski 1949). Prior was fascinated by the \u2018very neat symbolic\nnotation\u2019 due to \u0141ukasiewicz, and before long he turned his\nback completely on the more usual Peano-Russell notation. In\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s parenthesis-free notation, C\\(pq\\) is\nwritten for \u2018If \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)\u2019, and Bochenski\nwas later to describe Prior as even more of a\n\u2018CCCC-logician\u2019 than he was himself.\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s own Aristotle\u2019s Syllogistic and\nTarski\u2019s Introduction to Logic soon followed. By now the\nlogic bug had well and truly bitten. Prior saw from the work of the\nPoles that formal precision is possible in philosophy and this\ndelighted him. The upshot of Prior\u2019s reading for the curriculum\nwas that his students learned Aristotelian and medieval logic, using\nPolish notation and with Bochenski\u2019s Pr\u00e9cis de Logique\nMathematique as a text. \u2018Despite the language difficulty, I\nhave found this a first-class textbook to accompany lectures to New\nZealand students\u2019, Prior declared (1952c: 35).\n\n\nAn exuberant, playful man of seemingly inexhaustible vitality, Prior\nmade an excellent teacher. He had no trace of pomposity or pretension.\nHis students appreciated the friendly welcome they would receive at his\nhome, not to mention his relaxed attitude toward the administrative\nparaphernalia of roll-taking and the like. In those days Canterbury\nUniversity College was a formal, stuffy place and Prior was a breath of\nfresh air. Formality made him impatient; and he despised people he\ncalled \u2018bullshit artists\u2019 and \u2018dicky-lickers\u2019.\nIn a milieu where jacket and tie were the norm\u2014even in a\nsweltering New Zealand summer\u2014Prior would lecture in baggy khaki\nshorts and roman sandals. His student Jim Wilson recalls the friendly\ninformality of Prior\u2019s first-year classes:\n\n\n\nThe strained precision of clock time was alien to him, so he was\nusually late for his own lectures (or anyone else\u2019s for that\nmatter\u2014he was very egalitarian about it). But he almost always\nturned up eventually, thinning hair blown vertical by his dash on his\nbike when he remembered the time. He would pull cycle clips off his\ntrousers and plonk an ancient shopping bag on the desk in front of him.\nOut of this bag would come \u2026 a cabbage, a bunch of carrots, a\nloaf of bread, a bottle of milk \u2026 until, always at the bottom,\nhe would find the book he was looking for. Back into the bag went the\nrest of the goodies, then he would look up at us, apologise for being\nlate if he was more than usually so, and ask: \u2018Now where were we\nlast time?\u2019 Someone in the front row would consult her or his\nnotes\u2014Arthur couldn\u2019t as he never had any\u2014and would say\n\u2018You were just dealing with such and such\u2019. \u2018Ah yes,\nthank you\u2019 Arthur would respond, and forthwith launch into an\nextempore exposition which followed on perfectly from the previous\nsession and was beautifully structured and clear even though he was\njust thinking along with us. And of course we could stop him and ask\nfor clarification or elaboration at any time, without in the slightest\naffecting the overall structure and direction of his thoughts.\n\n\n\nSoon after his discovery of Pr\u00e9cis de Logique\nMathematique, Prior wrote to Bochenski in Fribourg and then, a\nlittle later, to \u0141ukasiewicz in Dublin. He was excited to receive\nreplies. \u2018We are, all of us, very isolated, being few and\nscattered\u2019, wrote Bochenski. \u2018It is a real pleasure to\nhear that a Colleague so far away is interested in the same problems\nyou are working at and that he finds one\u2019s little writings may\nbe of some use.\u2019 Thus began Prior\u2019s voluminous\ncorrespondence with logicians the world over. There were other ways,\ntoo, in which his isolation lessened. In 1951 he met and became\nfriends with John Mackie and Jack Smart, at a conference in\nSydney. This was Prior\u2019s first experience of being among a large\ngathering of philosophers; Mary Prior described the conference as his\n\u2018entry into a wider world\u2019. In the same year George\nHughes was appointed to the Victoria University of Wellington. Prior\nand Hughes had to make the most of their all-too-infrequent meetings,\nsometimes talking until the birds woke. Prior soon imparted his\nenthusiasm for logic to Hughes.\n \n\nPrior was also fortunate in having a number of excellent students\nduring these early years, among them Jonathan Bennett and Ronald\nButler: for Prior they were oases in the desert. In 1952, he gained an\nassistant lecturer, Sandy Anderson, son of the Sydney philosopher John\nAnderson, and following Prior\u2019s promotion to Professor later\nthat year, Philosophy became a department in its own right. Prior\nargued successfully for a new permanent member of staff, and in 1954\nJ.M. (Michael) Shorter was appointed to a lectureship. The young,\nOxford-educated Shorter worked previously at Aberdeen University,\nwhere Prior happened to be in touch with Polish logician\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Bednarowski.\n\n\nPrior worked intensely, often all through the night. 1949 saw the\npublication of his first book, a slim but potent volume titled\nLogic and the Basis of Ethics. It was published by the\nClarendon Press and soon became prominent in Oxford. Austin liked it\nand Ryle approved of \u2018Prior\u2019s complete lack of\nmugwumpery\u2019. In the Introduction Prior explained that by the\n\u2018logic of ethics\u2019 he meant \u2018not a special kind of\nlogic, nor a special branch of logic, but an application of it\u2019,\nand the book is a vigorous examination of the arguments of each side in\nthe naturalism/anti-naturalism debate.\n\nLogic and the Basis of Ethics contained no symbolism, and\nPrior\u2019s phrase \u2018the logic of ethics\u2019 was little more\nthan a battle cry. The few technical concepts that he used all related\nto syllogistic logic. It was not until 1952 that Prior began publishing\npapers in symbolic logic\u2014four of them, suddenly, in the same\nyear. At the unusually late age of 38 Prior had become a formal\nlogician. He wrote these papers while completing the manuscript of what\nwas intended to be his second postwar book, The Craft of Formal\nLogic. This began life in 1949 as a Dictionary of Formal Logic,\nbut, at the advice of the Clarendon Press, Prior soon switched to a\nmore orthodox format.\n\n\nHis logical interests veered sharply while he was writing The\nCraft. To sixteen chapters on the logic of categoricals,\nhypotheticals, terms and relations, he added, almost as an\nafterthought, one on modal logic and one on the axiomatic method. Prior\nfinished the manuscript in December 1951 and sent it to the Clarendon\nPress; fourteen months later they wrote agreeing to publish the book if\nPrior would both shorten it and give greater emphasis to modern logic.\nHe undertook to make the changes, but ended up writing a completely\ndifferent book. This was finally published in 1955 with the title\nFormal Logic; it ran into a second edition in 1962.\n\nThe Craft was Prior\u2019s third book-length manuscript\nthat failed to make it into print. His manuscript on Barth had died the\ndeath before the war, and his The Theology of the Church of\nScotland was a casualty when the Priors\u2019 Christchurch house\ncaught fire in 1949\u2014the book\u2019s remains, 163 charred pages\nof his handwriting, are in the Bodleian Library. (Scottish theology\nnevertheless remained \u2018part of the mulch that nourished his\nwork\u2019, Mary Prior said.) The Craft survives intact in\nthe Bodleian, except for a few missing pages. Some parts of it were\npublished posthumously, under the title The Doctrine of\nPropositions and Terms, but much of this fascinating manuscript\nremains unpublished.\n\nFormal Logic is steeped in Polish notation and the\naxiomatic method, and typifies Prior\u2019s mature work. It teaches,\nenthusiastically yet without fuss, that there was\nlife\u2014fascinating life\u2014before the here and now of logic.\nWhat Prior once wrote admiringly of \u0141ukasiewicz is no less true of\nPrior himself: \u2018having done very distinguished work as a\nmathematical logician in the modern style, [he] is at the same time\ninterested in the history of his subject \u2026 and contrives both to\nuse modern techniques to bring out more clearly what the ancients were\ndriving at, and to learn from the ancients useful logical devices which\nthe moderns have in general forgotten\u2019 (1952c: 37).\n\n\nAfter Findlay, \u0141ukasiewicz was the greatest single influence on\nPrior\u2019s development as a logician. Prior\u2019s 1952 review\narticle \u2018\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s Symbolic Logic\u2019 was one\nof his first papers to make extensive use of symbolism. He there\ndiscussed \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s book Aristotle\u2019s\nSyllogistic From the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic (published\nin 1951) and two articles, \u2018The Shortest Axiom of the\nImplicational Calculus of Propositions\u2019 and \u2018On Variable\nFunctions of Propositional Arguments\u2019. The first of these\narticles stimulated Prior\u2019s interest in economical bases for\npropositional and pure implicational logics (initially aroused by his\nstudy of Peirce) and the opening chapters of Formal Logic drew\nheavily on \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work in this area.\n\n\nPrior seems first to have learned of \u0141ukasiewicz through the\nwritings of his pupil Bochenski. \u0141ukasiewicz had devised an\naxiomatic treatment of Aristotle\u2019s reduction of the imperfect\nsyllogistic moods to those of the first figure, which Prior encountered\nin Bochenski\u2019s Pr\u00e9cis. This enchanted Prior. He\nwas taking his students through the derivations as early as 1951, and\nsummarized \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s system in the final chapter of\nThe Craft. Throughout the chapter he made extensive use of\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s symbolic notation. \nIt was \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s axiomatic treatment of traditional\nlogic that fully brought home to Prior the power of modern symbolic\nmethods. Moreover, it was probably his reading of \u0141ukasiewicz that\nmade clear to him the fundamental importance of propositional logic.\n\u2018It seems that Aristotle did not suspect the existence of another\nsystem of logic besides his theory of the syllogism\u2019,\n\u0141ukasiewicz had written, \u2018[y]et he uses intuitively the laws\nof propositional logic \u2026\u2019 (1951a: 49).\n(\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s axiomatisation of the syllogistic\nincorporated his own three-axiom formalization of propositional logic\n(1951a: 80).)\n\nIn his review, Prior approvingly quoted\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s assertion that \u2018the logic of the Stoics,\nthe inventors of the ancient form of the propositional calculus, was\nmuch more important than all the syllogisms of Aristotle\u2019\n(\u0141ukasiewicz 1951a: 131). In The Craft, propositional\nlogic is barely mentioned until the final chapter, whereas Formal\nLogic begins with a thorough introduction to the subject. On page\n3 of Formal Logic Prior stated that the logic of propositions\nis \u2018basic, and the rest of logic built upon it\u2019.\nHis interest in economical bases for propositional and pure implicational logics, initially aroused by his study of Peirce, was stimulated by \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s article \u2018The Shortest Axiom of the Implicational Calculus of Propositions\u2019, and the opening chapters of Formal Logic draw heavily on \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s work in this area.\n3.7 Back to England\n\n\nIn 1954, Gilbert Ryle visited New Zealand. He brought Prior an\ninvitation to visit Oxford and deliver the John Locke lectures. Prior\narranged a twelve month leave of absence from Canterbury and arrived in\nOxford at the beginning of 1956. Rather quickly a small group began to\nform around him: Ivo Thomas, John Lemmon, Peter Geach. (His meetings\nwith Prior were Lemmon\u2019s first introduction to modal logic.)\nHughes summarized the news arriving back home: \u2018this wild\ncolonial boy just hit Oxford and started to gather around him the main\npeople [interested in] logic, and he started to organise a lot of\nparties, almost, for the serious doing of logic\u2019. Prior kitted\nout his tiny rented apartment with a toyshop blackboard and held open\nhouse. On Mondays during Hilary and Trinity terms he lectured on modal\nlogic, his great passion, and on tense logic, his great invention. The\nlectures were published the following year, under the title Time\nand Modality.\n\n\nIn the summer break following the John Locke lectures, Prior\norganised a Logic Colloquium in Oxford. Logic was deeply out of fashion\nin 1950s Britain, and its practitioners were isolated and somewhat\ndemoralized. As Prior wrote shortly after the Colloquium, \u2018There\nare logicians in England and Ireland; but it must be admitted\nthat they are somewhat scattered, and so far as I could gather they had\nnever had any general get-together\u2019 (1956b: 186). Prior\u2019s\nColloquium brought together Lemmon, Thomas, Geach, M. Kneale, W.C.\nKneale, M.W. Dick, Lewy, Smiley, Bennett, Lejewski, Faris, Nidditch,\nCarew Meredith, David Meredith, and others. It was all a huge success,\nand the Colloquium became a regular fixture. Through his John Locke\nlectures, the Colloquium, and his numerous visits around the country,\nPrior helped to revitalise British logic. The group he left behind saw\nsimilarities between themselves and the close-knit group of researchers\nthat existed in Warsaw before 1939.\n\n\nIt was no doubt with mixed feelings that he returned to New Zealand.\nAfter twelve months of logical companionship on a grand scale, life at\nCanterbury was a lonely prospect. Seething with enthusiasm for logic,\nhe threw himself once more into a massive correspondence, but it could\nno longer satisfy him. Prior pined. When the offer arrived of a newly\nestablished second chair at the University of Manchester, he snatched\nit up. The Priors left New Zealand again in December 1958.\n3.8 Religion\n\n\nAs well as Prior\u2019s journeyings between the hemispheres, there\nwas his seemingly complicated inner journey from religious believer to\nnon-believer. The inner journey, which is not easy to chart, was\ncomplete by the time he arrived in Manchester, and seems to have taken\nmany years. It may have begun in 1941, with Prior\u2019s developing\ninterest in psychoanalytic explanations of the origin of religious\nbeliefs (a topic first alluded to in Prior (1935)). In his September\n1942 publication \u2018Can Religion Be Discussed?\u2019\u2014a\ndialogue between five characters named Barthian Protestant, Modernist\nProtestant, Catholic, Logician, and Psychoanalyst\u2014Prior gave the\nclosing speech to Psychoanalyst, who explains that circumstances may\n\u2018push\u2019 a believer into\n\n\n\nan emotional crisis in which they will go mad unless they do\nsomething about it, and then in the painful process of their own\nanalysis they will see for themselves the roots of their urge to\nbelieve. Only in this way are genuine atheists made. (Prior 1942a:\n150)\n\n\n\nIf these remarks were autobiographical there is no hint of it within\nthe article. But Prior was more forthcoming in an unpublished\nseven-page manuscript dated 25 March 1942 (Prior 1942b, Jakobsen 2016).\nThere he made it clear that he no longer considered himself a\nChristian, speaking of his \u2018Christian days\u2019 in the past\ntense, and denying that his ongoing interest in theology was a\n\u2018relapse into Christianity\u2019.\n\n\nIn \u2018Can Religion Be Discussed?\u2019 Prior made Psychoanalyst\nsay \u2018it\u2019s the religious illusion that\u2019s\nirresistible\u2019, and in the 1942 manuscript he stated bluntly that\n\u2018Theology is an illusion\u2019, adding \u2018but it is an\nillusion that is somehow \u201cclose to life\u201d\u2019. In this\nmanuscript he mentioned Freud by name several times; and in a\ntypescript concerning the application of Freudian theory to religion,\npossibly also written in 1941 or 1942 (Prior n.d.c., Hasle 1999, 2012),\nPrior explored \u2018the hidden non-religious basis and source of all\nreligious worship\u2019. He spoke of \u2018breaking the religious\nspell\u2019 and of \u2018the subconscious roots of religion\u2019\nbeing \u2018laid bare\u2019. The \u2018Being\u2019 that the\nreligious \u2018refer to as the real object of worship\u2019 is,\nPrior suggested, \u2018all the time a fiction\u2019.\n\n\nPrior\u2019s position at this point, then, was seemingly that\nreligious discourse is a form of fictional discourse\u2014although the\nfiction is \u2018close to life\u2019. He also appears to have thought\nthat believers utilize what Psychoanalyst calls \u2018tricks\u2019 in\norder to prevent knowledge of the subconscious origins of this fiction\nfrom reaching their consciousness, and so breaking the religious spell\n(Prior 1942a: 146\u20137).\n\n\nPrior soon retreated from this leap toward unbelief. According to\nhis military record, he was a \u2018Presby\u2019 (Presbyterian) again\nby about 1944. But although his scepticism born of psychoanalysis had\nweakened, it seems this was eventually replaced by philosophical\nscepticism of a more ordinary sort. The New Zealand philosopher Jim\nThornton, who was Prior\u2019s student during the period\n1949\u20131953, recollected that \u2018at the time when I was one of\nhis senior students I got the impression that he thought Hume\u2019s\nscepticism on religious belief was impressive\u2019. Thornton\ncontinued \u2018He enjoyed drawing our attention to Hume\u2019s irony\nin various passages in the Dialogues Concerning Natural\nReligion, and also in the closing paragraph of the essay Of\nMiracles\u2019:\n\n\n\nMere reason is insufficient to convince us of its veracity: And\nwhoever is moved by Faith to assent to it, is conscious of a continued\nmiracle in his own person, which subverts all the principles of his\nunderstanding, and gives him a determination to believe\u2026 (Hume\n1777, 10.101)\n\n\n\nDespite his liking for Hume\u2019s scepticism, Prior took the\nserious step in 1951 of becoming an elder of St Martin\u2019s\nPresbyterian Church in Christchurch. Elders are responsible for the\nspiritual oversight of the congregation, and he was assigned a\n\u2018district\u2019 of perhaps 15\u201320 households drawn from the\ncongregation, and was expected to visit each of them regularly.\nWhatever his philosophical doubts may have been, Prior was now a pillar\nof the Presbyterian community. \u2018Lord, I believe; help thou mine\nunbelief!\u2019 he had made his Barthian Protestant character say in\n1942.\n\n\n1956, the year of Arthur\u2019s sabbatical in Oxford, seems to have\nbeen a turning point. Perhaps sheer distance helped to loosen\nreligion\u2019s tug, not only on him but also on Mary. Once back in\nNew Zealand, the family\u2019s churchgoing was much less regular.\nSpeaking of this time, their son Martin said \u2018I think Mary and\nArthur were starting to lapse in their beliefs\u2019. Arthur continued\nas an elder at St Martin\u2019s, officially until he left the country\nfor Manchester in December 1958, but ceased attending the monthly\nmeetings of elders from April 1958\u2014and contrary to custom, did\nnot even bother to send in his apologies for the meetings that he\nmissed.\n\n\nRobert Bull, who was Arthur\u2019s student from 1957, remembered him taking\nhis church duties flippantly. On one occasion Arthur broke off a\nconversation about logic with a puckish \u2018I\u2019ve got to go and\ndeliver the fucking communion cards\u2019. Mary laughed, exclaiming\n\u2018Arthur!\u2019. The cards were invitations to the communion\nservice and, as an elder, he was obliged to deliver one to each person\nin his district. By this time, the Priors\u2019 religious observance\nwas probably just a matter of not wanting to upset the boat\u2014and\nperhaps especially not the Reverend Frank Wilkinson, Mary\u2019s\nfather.\n\n\nOnce the Priors were in Manchester, churchgoing became a thing of\nthe past.\n3.9 Last Years\n\n\nPrior was at Manchester for seven years. In 1966, Anthony Kenny\nrecommended him for a fellowship at Balliol. The move would mean a drop\nin both status and salary, not to mention an increase in teaching, but\nPrior did not hesitate. His sabbatical in Oxford had been one of his\nhappiest years. \u2018This is the good life\u2019, he told George\nHughes once he was settled in at Balliol. He felt he simply belonged.\nPrior soon built up a reputation for being one of the best teachers in\nOxford\u2014though his students were sometimes surprised to be given\neighteenth century moralists to read instead of books by the currently\nfashionable.\n\n\nJust before his departure from Manchester, Prior told Tom Richards,\na visiting New Zealander, that he was going to Oxford with a mission.\nPrior\u2019s own work was an exemplary fusion of philosophy and logic,\nand he went to Oxford with the intention of interesting the\nmathematical logicians in philosophy and the philosophers in\nmathematical logic. The time was right; and Prior spared no energy in\npreaching his message:\n\n\n\n[F]ormal logic and general philosophy have more to bring to one\nanother than is sometimes supposed. I do not mean by saying this to\nunderrate the work of those who have explored the properties of\nsymbolic calculi without any concern as to what they might be used to\nmean \u2026 Nor do I mean to underrate what recent philosophers have\ndone in the way of exploring the obstinate and intricate\n\u2018logic\u2019 embedded in common discourse, even when they have\nnot derived or sought to derive anything like a calculus from it\n\u2026 But these activities are, or can be, related to one another\nvery much as theory and observation are in the physical sciences; and I\nmust confess to a hankering after well-constructed theories which much\ncontemporary philosophy fails to satisfy. (1957: vii.)\n\n\n\nPrior did not live to enjoy the entente cordiale between\nphilosophy and logic that he helped usher in. His health began to let\nhim down during his second year at Balliol. He was found to have both\nangina pectoris and polymyalgic rheumatism. During the autumn of 1969\nthe rheumatism grew steadily worse. He was at this time on sabbatical\nat the University of Oslo. The pain left him with no zest for work. He\ndutifully gave his weekly seminars and spent the remainder of his time\nbrooding savagely on how painful it was to do such elementary things as\nput on a coat. His hosts made him an appointment with a rheumatologist,\nwho prescribed cortisone. In a letter written a few days later, and a\nfew days before his heart failed, Prior described himself as one of the\nmiracles of modern medicine. \u2018I\u2019ve been sleeping well \u2026\nrunning up and down stairs \u2026 I can stand on one leg and put a\nsock on the other (first time for months) \u2026 they\u2019ve got me\ncured now and I\u2019m fine.\u2019\n3.10 Legacy in New Zealand\n\nLong after he departed for England in December 1958, Prior and his\nideas remained a strong influence on the development of logic in New\nZealand\u2014beginning with his arranging for Robert Bull and\nJonathan Bennett to share the teaching of his Advanced Logic course at\nCanterbury in 1959. Bull had recently found a completeness proof for a\nDiodorean logic of pure implication and taught this to the class\n(\u2018heaven help me\u2014and them\u2019, he says now).\n\nHugh Montgomery was among Bull\u2019s audience. Montgomery had been a\nmathematics student at Canterbury during the 1940s, while Prior was\nsingle-handedly booting undergraduate logic into existence. Now\nresuming his studies after a career as a furniture manufacturer in\nChristchurch, Montgomery fell heavily for logic. He found himself\n\u2018becoming more and more interested in tenses\u2019, after\nreading Prior\u2019s \u2018Diodoran Modalities\u2019. 1962 saw him\njoining the Canterbury philosophy department as an assistant lecturer\n(by then Shorter had succeeded Prior as professor and two lecturers\nhad been appointed, Jim Thornton and Rudi Ziedens).\n\nMontgomery was soon publishing a brisk flow of papers on modal\nlogic. Many were co-authored with Richard Routley, who graduated from\nthe Victoria University of Wellington\u2014known to all as\n\u2018Vic\u2019\u2014not long before Montgomery enrolled in\nBull\u2019s course. \u2018I grew up in the shadow of Prior\u2019,\nRoutley said: \u2018He was, I suppose, the dominant figure in New\nZealand philosophy in the late 1950s\u2019. There were other\nimportant philosophers working there, Routley conceded, \u2018but\nthey did not have the panache of Prior, or the larger-than-life\nstature, or the doctrine\u2019 (Sylvan 1996: 126). Routley moved to\nAustralia and went on to pioneer relevant and dialethic logics, as\nwell as environmental philosophy, changing his name to Sylvan in the\n1980s (he loved trees, especially the New Zealand\nkauri). Montgomery\u2014with Prior\u2019s forceful backing\u2014was\nappointed associate professor at Auckland University in 1969, and then\nto Auckland\u2019s chair of philosophy in 1970.\n\nBull, meanwhile, had followed Prior to England in 1960. He was\nsupposed to be going to Cambridge, but Prior\u2019s suggestion that\nhe divert to Manchester won the day. Max Cresswell joined them in\nManchester a year later. A student of George Hughes and David Londey\nat Vic, Cresswell had accidentally come across Prior\u2019s Formal\nLogic in the university library in 1957, at the end of his first\nundergraduate year. Excited by this discovery he also devoured Time\nand Modality. When he won a Commonwealth Scholarship for\npostgraduate study in the United Kingdom, Cresswell seized the\nopportunity to work with Prior. In 1963, he turned in his Ph.D., on\npropositional logics, and\u2014with a strong reference from\nPrior\u2014arrived back at Vic to step into Londey\u2019s\nshoes. (Londey, an Australian, was returning home.) Cresswell went on\nto dominate New Zealand logic for the next three decades. Bull\ncompleted a Ph.D. on modal logic under Prior, in 1962, and then enrolled\nat Oxford to study for a DPhil under Michael Dummett. At Oxford, Bull\nbegan publishing an important series of papers developing Priorean\ntense and modal logics (including his 1964, 1965 and 1970\u2014his\nand Krister Segerberg\u2019s 1984 handbook entry \u2018Basic Modal\nLogic\u2019 is still valuable today). With two doctorates in hand,\nBull worked at Birmingham and then Leeds before returning to a senior\nlectureship at Canterbury, at the end of 1968. From afar, Prior was\nstationing his men to fight for logic in his native land.\n\nWhen Cresswell arrived back, Wellington was becoming the focal point\nof logic in New Zealand. Hughes and Londey had a strong group of\ngraduate students, including Dorothy Grover and Tom Richards. Londey\nliked to use the English translation of Hilbert and Ackermann\u2019s\npre-war Grundz\u00fcge der Theoretischen Logik as a text for his\nadvanced course, and in 1965 he and Hughes published their own The\nElements of Formal Logic, aimed at undergraduates\u2014Prior\nreviewed it in the Australasian Journal of Philosophy,\ndescribing it as \u2018a very good buy\u2019 and \u2018broadly in\nthe style of Hilbert and Ackermann, and even more that of von\nWright\u2019 (Prior 1966). Also in 1965, Hughes and Cresswell\ntrialled the idea of an undergraduate course in modal logic. The\nElements contained no modal logic, and the lack of any suitable\ntextbook for the new course was a problem. \u2018We\u2019ll have to\nwrite our own\u2019, Hughes said jokingly to Cresswell. Their\nfamous An Introduction to Modal Logic appeared in 1968,\novernight turning modal logic from a subject accessible only to\nexperts into one that almost everybody with a bit of logic could\nunderstand.\n\nLogical mass was building. Malcolm Rennie, a young Australian, joined\nAuckland University in 1965 as a lecturer (snatched it is said from\nunder the nose of Jack Smart, who wanted him for the University of\nAdelaide). Rennie was strongly influenced by Prior\u2019s work, and\nbegan publishing a stream of papers on tense and modal logic. His 1971\narticle on Prior\u2019s tense system \\(QK_t\\) included a\neulogy: \u2018This paper is dedicated to the memory of the late\nArthur Prior: it was never my good fortune to meet him, but I am very\ngrateful for his personal encouragement in correspondence, and for the\ninterest generated by his many fertile and imaginative writings\u2019\n(Rennie 1971: 107). In 1968, Rennie taught a graduate course on Prior\nto his Auckland students, covering Priorean tense logic in Polish\nnotation.\n\nOn the other side of the world, at the 1968 Joint Session of the\nAristotelian Society and Mind Association at Liverpool University,\nPrior attended a symposium on \u2018What Actually Exists?\u2019,\ngiven by Peter Geach and Robert Stoothoff. He was impressed by\nStoothoff, saying approvingly in a letter to Montgomery that the young\nAmerican had \u2018done a lot of fighting for logic\u2019. Stoothoff\nwas unexpectedly contacted by Canterbury and offered\nShorter\u2019s\u2014Prior\u2019s\u2014chair. He accepted, arriving\nin Christchurch in 1970. (Shorter was moving on to a fellowship at\nLincoln College, Oxford.) Also in 1970, the Czech logician Pavel\nTich\u00fd accepted a senior lectureship in philosophy at the University\nof Otago. Tich\u00fd had fled his native Prague soon after Soviet tanks\ntook command of the streets in 1968. (His escape from East to West\nwas ably assisted by Geoffrey Keene, a logician from Exeter University\nin the UK (Svoboda et al. 2004: 26).) Once settled in New Zealand\nTich\u00fd wrote a paper on quantified S5, taking Hughes and Cresswell to\ntask for mis-formalizing a modal principle stated by Prior and von\nWright (Tich\u00fd 1973, Prior 1955a: 211). Soon he was indulging in the\nnational logical pastime of exploring Priorean temporal logics.\n\n1970 saw Cresswell visiting Segerberg in Finland (on the shores of the\nBaltic at Villa Wolax, the gracious 19th century summerhouse that the\nSegerbergs were renting from the von Wright family). Cresswell and\nSegerberg gathered mushrooms in the forest and spoke of logic in New\nZealand. It was an auspicious meeting. When Montgomery died, at the\ntragically early age of 53, Cresswell proposed Segerberg for the\nAuckland chair. The Segerbergs remember getting a call from New\nZealand \u2018in the middle of the night\u2019. The job came\n\u2018on a silver platter\u2019, Segerberg said. After a brief visit\nin 1979, Segerberg moved to Auckland in 1980. He found that New\nZealand logic was \u2018in a vibrant state\u2019.\n\nBy about 1970 a new generation of home-grown logicians had begun to\nenter the post-Prior landscape. In 1971, Rob Goldblatt took up a\njunior lectureship in mathematics at Vic. Wellington born and bred,\nGoldblatt learned modal logic from lectures by Cresswell and Hughes\nduring his second undergraduate year, and he completed his Ph.D. thesis\n\u2018Metamathematics of Modal Logic\u2019 under Cresswell in\n1974. \u2018That remarkable thesis established modal logic as a\nmature mathematical discipline\u2019, Bull said. Soon Goldblatt was\npublishing a deluge of papers on modal logic. Also in 1974 Fred Kroon,\npreviously one of the students in Rennie\u2019s Prior course at\nAuckland, was appointed to a lectureship in the Auckland philosophy\ndepartment. John Bigelow, who, as a Canterbury undergraduate, had been\ntaught \u2018terrific logic\u2019 by Montgomery, took up a\nlectureship in philosophy at Vic in 1973. Another admirer of Prior,\nBigelow was deeply immersed in tense and modal logic (working with\nHughes on tense logic), and he later staunchly defended Prior\u2019s\npresentism. When Bigelow arrived home in 1973 from his Ph.D. studies at\nCambridge, he found that New Zealand had become \u2018a powerhouse in\nlogic\u2019.\n\nAn interdisciplinary logic group formed around Hughes and Cresswell in\n1968, meeting at first fortnightly, and then weekly from about\n1970. The Wellington logic group \u2018was a deliberate attempt to\nmarry interests in mathematics and philosophy\u2019, said Wilf\nMalcolm, who worked on the foundations of mathematics (Malcolm 1975)\nand later became Professor of Pure Mathematics at Vic. Apart from the\nsheer logical talent of those involved in the Wellington group,\nCresswell put the group\u2019s stellar success down to the fact\nthat\u2014unlike much in today\u2019s universities\u2014it was not\na managed creation: it had \u2018just grown and wasn\u2019t\nplanned\u2019.\n\nThe Wellington group, and New Zealand logic more generally, were a\nmagnet for visitors. Angelika Kratzer first visited the group in 1974,\ninitiating an association with the University of Konstanz and\nlogicians in Germany. Others from Germany soon arrived, including\nArnim von Stechow and Rainer B\u00e4uerle. Stanis\u0142aw Surma\nvisited, also in 1974, kick-starting the group\u2019s association\nwith Polish logicians (later, Segerberg hired Surma at Auckland). Dick\nEpstein visited the group from the United States in 1974, and then\nreturned in 1975 for a two-year stay at Vic; while there he worked on\ncomputability and also on what he called \u2018relatedness\nlogic\u2019, a form of relevance logic. Other visitors from North\nAmerica included Doug Walton, who spent the year 1975\u201376 at Vic\nworking on the logic of action. Steve Thomason visited the group in\n1973 while spending a year with Bull at Canterbury, where he worked on\nembedding second-order logic in modal logic and on applying category\ntheory to modal logic.\n\nMike Dunn and Nuel Belnap visited the Wellington group during\n1975\u201376, Donald Davidson in 1977, Leszek Szczerba (a colleague\nof Tarski) in 1977, and Segerberg briefly in 1979 (in 1971 the group\nworked through his recent Ph.D. thesis \u2018An Essay in Classical\nModal Logic\u2019 (Segerberg 1971)). Many others spent time with the\ngroup. David Lewis first visited in 1971, and then for several months\nin 1976, thereafter becoming a regular visitor to New Zealand. Lewis\nand Ken Pledger, another member of the group, shared an enthusiasm for\ntrain timetables, which they exchanged eagerly. Pledger was a geometer\nfrom the Vic mathematics department who\u2014like many\u2014first\nencountered modal logic in Hughes\u2019 and Cresswell\u2019s 1968\nbook. Pledger worked on extensions of S3 and on a modal system lying\nsomewhere between B and S5, and later spent a sabbatical at Warsaw\nUniversity with Szczerba\u2014another geometer\u2014where he\nfinished a Ph.D. on \u2018Some Interrelations between Geometry and\nModal Logic\u2019.\n\nIn 1976 the Wellington group ran a week-long logic school, coinciding\nwith Lewis\u2019s stay. Epstein did much of the organizing. Hughes\nlectured on modal logic and Cresswell on the formal semantics of\nnatural languages\u2014his groundbreaking book Logics and\nLanguages had appeared in 1973. Numerous other group members and\nvisitors lectured on their research. The school \u2018brought out\ninto the open \u2026 a wide variety of quite exciting work \u2026\nthat had in fact been building up over quite a period of time\u2019,\nMalcolm said. The Vic logicians were surprised by the large number of\nenrolments in the school\u2014academics and students from New\nZealand, Australia, and beyond. It was a spectacular shop-window,\nheaped with New Zealand logic. Malcolm later described the school as\nthe Wellington group\u2019s \u2018coming-of-age\u2019.\n\nBy then, the compliment that the founding father of logic in New\nZealand had once paid to California was true also of his own\ncountry. New Zealand had become one of the most logically mature\nplaces in the world for the study of modality and tense.\n",
