    "main_text": "Symmetry Breaking || Explicit symmetry breaking\n4.1 Explicit symmetry breaking\n\nExplicit symmetry breaking indicates a situation where the dynamical\nequations are not manifestly invariant under the symmetry group\nconsidered. This means, in the Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) formulation,\nthat the Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) of the system contains one or more\nterms explicitly breaking the symmetry. Such terms can have different\norigins:\n\n(a) Symmetry-breaking terms may be introduced into the theory by hand\non the basis of theoretical/experimental results, as in the case of\nthe quantum field theory of the weak interactions, which is expressly\nconstructed in a way that manifestly violates mirror symmetry or\nparity. The underlying result, in this case, is parity\nnon-conservation in the case of the weak interaction, first predicted\nin the famous (Nobel-prize winning) 1956 paper by T. D. Lee and C.N.\nYang.\n\n(b) Symmetry-breaking terms may appear in the theory because of\nquantum-mechanical effects. One reason for the presence of such terms\n\u2014 known as \u201canomalies\u201d \u2014 is that in passing\nfrom the classical to the quantum level, because of possible operator\nordering ambiguities for composite quantities such as Noether charges\nand currents, it may be that the classical symmetry algebra (generated\nthrough the Poisson bracket structure) is no longer realized in terms\nof the commutation relations of the Noether charges. Moreover, the use\nof a \u201cregulator\u201d (or \u201ccut-off\u201d) required in\nthe renormalization procedure to achieve actual calculations may\nitself be a source of anomalies. It may violate a symmetry of the\ntheory, and traces of this symmetry breaking may remain even after the\nregulator is removed at the end of the calculations. Historically, the\nfirst example of an anomaly arising from renormalization is the\nso-called chiral anomaly, that is the anomaly violating the chiral\nsymmetry of the strong interaction (see Weinberg, 1996, Chapter\n22).\n\n(c) Finally, symmetry-breaking terms may appear because of\nnon-renormalizable effects. Physicists now have good reasons for\nviewing current renormalizable field theories as effective field\ntheories, that is low-energy approximations to a deeper theory\n(each effective theory explicitly referring only to those particles\nthat are of importance at the range of energies considered). The\neffects of non-renormalizable interactions (due to the heavy particles\nnot included in the theory) are small and can therefore be ignored at\nthe low-energy regime. It may then happen that the coarse-grained\ndescription thus obtained possesses more symmetries than the deeper\ntheory. That is, the effective Lagrangian obeys symmetries that are\nnot symmetries of the underlying theory. These\n\u201caccidental\u201d symmetries, as Weinberg has called them, may\nthen be violated by the non-renormalizable terms arising from higher\nmass scales and suppressed in the effective Lagrangian (see Weinberg,\n1995, pp. 529\u2013531).\n",
