    "main_text": "Causalism and Causal Theories of Action || Davidson\u2019s Predecessors and the Central Arguments in the Debate\n2.1 Davidson\u2019s Predecessors and the Central Arguments in the Debate\n\nDavidson\u2019s view in ARC is presented against a number of\nphilosophers (mostly influenced by Wittgenstein), who, on his view,\ntake action explanations to provide a different kind of understanding\nthan causal explanations (for a sympathetic overview of this\nWittgenstein-inspired work, see Sandis 2015). Some of the identified\ntargets of the paper (such as Melden 1961) are clearly arguing for the\nviews Davidson rejects. Others (such as Anscombe 1957 and Ryle 1949)\ndo not clearly embrace the theses Davidson objects to, or at least not\nall of them. These philosophers took intentional explanations to\ndisplay how an action is made intelligible or justified. So Melden\nsays that \u201cciting a motive [gives] a fuller characterization of\nthe action; it [provides] a better understanding of what the [agent]\nis doing\u201d (Melden 1961, 88). Similarly, Anscombe\u2019s special\nsense of the question \u201cWhy?\u2019, discussed below (section\n4.1), is supposed to pick out the particular way in which actions are\nexplained. This claim is not one that Davidson denies; according to\nDavidson, in intentional explanations, or\n\u2018rationalizations\u2019, \u201dthe agent is shown in his Role\nof Rational Animal \u2026 There is an irreducible \u2026 sense in\nwhich every rationalization justifies: from the agent\u2019s point of\nview there was, when he acted, something to be said for the\naction.\u201c (Davidson 1963, 690\u20131). But Melden, and other\nWittgensteineans, argue that this kind of explanation cannot be a\ncausal explanation. Melden\u2019s central argument is the\n\u201dlogical connection\u201c argument. According to Melden, since\nthe supposedly causal antecedents of an action (mental items such as\ndesires and intentions) are logically related to the intentional\naction (I would not count as intentionally signalling a turn if I did\nnot desire/intend to signal a turn), the explanation of the action in\nterms of such mental items cannot be an explanation in terms of\n\u201dHumean causes\u201c. After all, Humean causation connects\nevents that are logically independent.\n\nDavidson\u2019s ARC exposes a crucial fallacy with Melden\u2019s\nargument (similar problems had been pointed out by Annette Baier (then\nAnnette Stoop) in Stoop 1962). Accepting Hume\u2019s account of\ncausal relations does not commit us to the view that any description\nof a cause is logically independent of any description of its effect.\nAn event can only be described as \u201dsunburning\u201c if it is\ncaused by exposure to the sun, but this does not mean that the cause\nof a sunburn is not a \u201dseparate entity\u201c from the sunburn.\nWe can describe an event as \u201dThe event that caused X\u201c\nwithout thereby refuting Humeanism about causation. Davidson argues\nthat, on the contrary, the mental items cited in an action explanation\ncan only explain the action if they are also the cause of the action\n(the second central thesis of ARC). In our example above, Larry might\nhave had other belief-desire pairs that rationalized his action of\ngoing to the barber. For instance, Larry might also have wanted a\nbottle of cream soda and believed that he could procure such an item\nat Gus the Barber. However, he did not (we may stipulate) go there\nbecause he wanted cream soda but because he wanted a haircut (and\nbelieved he could get one at Gus the Barber). The only way we can\nexplain the difference between potentially rationalizing, but\nnon-explanatory belief-desire pairs, is that the belief-desire pair\nthat genuinely explains the action, the primary reason, also causes\nthe action. The question of how non-causal theories can distinguish\nbetween merely potentially explanatory reasons for an action from the\nreasons that actually explain it became known as\n\u201dDavidson\u2019s Challenge\u201c to non-causal theories of\naction (Mele 1992; Mele 2013).\n",
