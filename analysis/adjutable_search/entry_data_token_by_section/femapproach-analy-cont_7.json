    "main_text": "Epistemic Injustice || The Analytic Tradition\n3.1 The Analytic Tradition\n\nFricker takes up two varieties of epistemic injustice: testimonial and\nhermeneutical. Her account of the former can be seen as a development\nof claims Jennifer Hornsby and Rae Langton (1998) made about silencing\nwith reference to Catharine MacKinnon\u2019s claim that pornography\ninterferes with women\u2019s freedom of speech (1993). Freedom of\nspeech involves not simply the ability to make claims but, more\nimportantly, the ability to have illocutionary effects in which\none\u2019s audience takes up those claims. MacKinnon focuses on the\nability to refuse sex by saying no. Under the influence of pornography\none\u2019s audience may not recognize what one is trying to do with\none\u2019s words and may fail to take this no as a refusal. For\nFricker, structural identity prejudices in general affect one\u2019s\ncredibility as a speaker and conveyor of knowledge. Her example is the\nway, in the screenplay of \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley,\u201d Marge\nSherwood is unable to communicate her suspicions about Ripley to her\nfather-in-law, Herbert Greenleaf, because of the identity prejudices\nhe holds about women. Assuming that women tend to respond emotionally\ninstead of rationally to a situation, he downgrades her credibility\nand effectively silences her. The testimonial injustice here excludes\nSherwood from the social practice of pooling information.\n\nKristie Dotson (2011) distinguishes two different kinds of silencing\npractices: testimonial quieting and testimonial smothering. While\ntestimonial quieting characterizes a failure to recognize the speaker\nas a knower and thus to offer the speaker appropriate uptake, Dotson\ndescribes testimonial smothering as a coerced truncation by speakers\nof their own testimony. Speakers recognize that their audiences are\nunwilling or unable to offer appropriate uptake to their testimony,\nand in response, limit and shape their testimony in order to\n\u201cinsure that the testimony contains only content for which\none\u2019s audience demonstrates testimonial competence\u201d (2011,\n244). Dotson characterizes both of these silencing practices as forms\nof epistemic violence, and both have dramatic effects for the\nepistemic pursuits of individuals and communities alike.\n\nDotson (2017) extends this analysis by offering an epistemological\nreading of Pauli Murray\u2019s (1947) conception of a Jane Crow\nsystem of subordination, one that both targets Black women, making\nthem hypervisible, and ignores them, making them invisible. Dotston\nis interested in the production of knowledge that facilitates this\nkind of subordination and identifies three conditions for it. First,\nshared assumptions and other epistemic resources can highlight certain\nsubjects for study and render others uninteresting or irrelevant. From\nthis point of view, Black women occupy \u201cnegative socio-epistemic\nspace.\u201d Second, this negative-epistemic space means that Black women\nlack credibility precisely in trying to articulate it. Finally, in\nwhat Dotson calls epistemic backgrounding, Black women serve as the\nbackdrop for some other subjects of study \u2013 for example, in\nclaims that Black boys are the most endangered U.S. population, as if\nthe factors that cause this endangerment (poverty, poor schools and\nthe character of policing) do not apply to Black girls as well.\n\nWith regard to hermeneutical injustice, Fricker focuses on gaps in the\ncollective hermeneutical resources that make it difficult for members\nof particular groups, including women, to make sense out of and\narticulate important areas of their experience. The available\nresources are either not adequate for expressing these areas of\nexperience or they are misleading. Where this failure or inadequacy\naffects people differentially it is unjust, Fricker argues. As an\nexample she points to the damage done to many women\u2019s lives and\ncareers after they suffered unwanted sexual advances on the job before\nsexual harassment was a hermeneutical resource available to make sense\nout of their experience (2007, 152). Fricker thinks it would be a\nmistake to see this gap in the collective hermeneutic resources as\nmerely bad timing, as might be the case if one suffered from a disease\nthat had not yet been diagnosed or understood. Rather, to the extent\nthat the gap affected women and their sexual harassers differentially\nit led to an injustice. It also derived from one. Fricker argues that\nthe hermeneutical gap was the result of \u201cunequal hermeneutical\nparticipation\u201d in which women were left out of or barred from\nengaging in the formation of the relevant collective understandings\n(Fricker 2007: 152). This marginalization, she argues, results from a\ncombination of two forms of power: identity power that downgrades a\nspeaker\u2019s credibility and material power. In a social world in\nwhich men have more power than women, men also have more say over\ndefining what experiences mean and the result is to render \u201cthe\ncollective hermeneutical resource structurally prejudiced\u201d\n(2007, 154\u20135).\n\nShelley Tremain (2017) finds a problem with Fricker\u2019s\ndistinction between hermeneutical gaps due to diseases not yet\ndiagnosed and hermeneutical gaps that reflect hermeneutical injustice.\nWhile Fricker wants to see the former as a case of mere bad luck,\nTremain points to the lack of hermeneutical resources many disabled\npeople suffer because of social, cultural and political norms that are\nas inadequate and misleading as those distorting attempts to\narticulate the experience of sexual harassment. As she writes,\n\u201cUntil the relatively recent formation and rise of \u2018the\nmad pride movement\u2019 and related social movements, the\nhermeneutical resources that such disabled people required in order to\ncollectively understand the political character of their situation\nwere unavailable to them\u201d (178).\n\nOther feminists add to Fricker\u2019s account of hermeneutical\ninjustice just as they do to her account of testimonial injustice.\nFollowing up on Charles Mills\u2019 account of white ignorance\n(1998), Gaile Pohlhaus, Jr., for example, conceives of the consequence\nof this structural prejudice as a willful hermeneutical ignorance in\nwhich \u201cdominantly situated knowers\u2026continue to\nmisunderstand and misinterpret the world\u201d (2012, 716). Dotson\nuses this idea of willful hermeneutical ignorance to identify a third\nfeature of epistemic injustice along with testimonial and\nhermeneutical injustice: namely contributory injustice in which\nwillful hermeneutical ignorance compromises a speaker\u2019s\nepistemic agency and obstructs the capacity to contribute to a\ncommunity\u2019s collective hermeneutical resources (2012, 31).\n\nFricker\u2019s solution to testimonial injustice relies on the\nvirtuous sensibility that allows one, when necessary, to neutralize\none\u2019s identity prejudices and negative credibility judgments\nabout speakers while her solution to hermeneutical injustice relies on\nan awareness of possible gaps in the hermeneutical resources available\nto them. In responding to her critics, Fricker also distinguishes\nbetween \u201cin-group intelligibility\u201d within marginalized\ngroups and their \u201cfrustratingly failed attempts to\ncommunicate\u201d (2016, 167) with dominant groups. Together with\nJenkins she also underscores the relation between testimonial\ninjustice and ignorance, especially with regard to trans experiences\n(2017).\n",
