    "main_text": "Computer Simulations and Experimentation\n7. Conclusion\n\nIn this entry varying views on the nature of experimental results have\nbeen presented. Some argue that the acceptance of experimental results\nis based on epistemological arguments, whereas others base acceptance\non future utility, social interests, or agreement with existing\ncommunity commitments. Everyone agrees , however, that for whatever\nreasons, a consensus is reached on experimental results. These results\nthen play many important roles in physics and we have examined several\nof these roles, although certainly not all of them. We have seen\nexperiment deciding between two competing theories, calling for a new\ntheory, confirming a theory, refuting a theory, providing evidence\nthat determined the mathematical form of a theory, and providing\nevidence for the existence of an elementary particle involved in an\naccepted theory. We have also seen that experiment has a life of its\nown, independent of theory. If, as I believe, epistemological\nprocedures provide grounds for reasonable belief in experimental\nresults, then experiment can legitimately play the roles I have\ndiscussed and can provide the basis for scientific knowledge.\n",
