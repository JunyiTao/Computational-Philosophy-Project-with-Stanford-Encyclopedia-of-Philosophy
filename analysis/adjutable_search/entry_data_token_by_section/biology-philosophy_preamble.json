    "main_text": "\n\nThe growth of philosophical interest in biology over the past forty\nyears reflects the increasing prominence of the biological sciences in\nthe same period. There is now an extensive literature on many\ndifferent biological topics, and it would be impossible to summarise\nthis body of work in this single entry. Instead, this entry sets out\nto explain what philosophy of biology is. Why does biology\nmatter to philosophy and vice versa? A list of the entries in the\nencyclopedia which address specific topics in the philosophy of\nbiology is provided at the end of the entry.\n\nThree different kinds of philosophical inquiry fall under the general\nheading of philosophy of biology. First, general theses in the\nphilosophy of science are addressed in the context of biology. Second,\nconceptual problems within biology itself are subjected to\nphilosophical analysis. Third, appeals to biology are made in\ndiscussions of traditional philosophical questions. \n\nPhilosophy of biology can also be subdivided by the particular areas\nof the life sciences with which it is concerned. Biology is an\nextremely diverse set of disciplines, ranging from historical sciences\nsuch as paleontology to engineering sciences such as biotechnology.\nDifferent philosophical issues occur in each field. The latter part of\nthe entry discusses how philosophers have approached some of the main\ndisciplines within biology.\n",
