    "main_text": "Objections || No Propositional Knowledge 2: The Acquaintance Hypothesis\n4.5 No Propositional Knowledge 2: The Acquaintance Hypothesis\n\nEarl Conee (1994) proposes another variant of the No Propositional\nKnowledge-View. According to Conee acquaintance constitutes a\nthird category of knowledge that is neither reducible to factual\nknowledge nor to knowing-how and he argues that Mary acquires after\nrelease only acquaintance knowledge. According to Conee knowing\nsomething by acquaintance \u201crequires the person to be familiar\nwith the known entity in the most direct way that it is possible for a\nperson to be aware of that thing\u201d (1994, 144). Since\n\u201cexperiencing a quality is the most direct way to apprehend a\nquality\u201d (Conee 1994, 144), Mary gains acquaintance with color\nqualia only after release. According to the view proposed by Conee the\nphysicalist can defend himself against the knowledge argument in the\nfollowing way: (1) Qualia are physical properties of experiences (and\nexperiences are physical processes). Let Q be such a\nproperty. (2) Mary can know all about Q and she can know that\na given experience has Q before release,\nalthough \u2013 before release \u2013 she is not acquainted with\nQ. (3) After release Mary gets acquainted with Q,\nbut she does not acquire any new item of propositional knowledge by\ngetting acquainted with Q (in particular she already knew\nunder what conditions normal perceivers have experiences with the\nproperty Q). More recently Michael Tye (2009, 131\u2013137)\ndefends the acquaintance hypothesis as the right answer to the\nknowledge argument thereby abandoning his original response (see below\n4.7).\n\nA friend of the knowledge argument might concede that a person is\nacquainted with Q only if she has or had an experience with\nproperty Q but he would have to insist that being acquainted\nwith Q in that sense is a necessary condition for being able\nto know (in the relevant sense) that an experience has Q.\nAnother kind of criticism of the Acquaintance Hypothesis is developed\nin Gertler (1999). She argues that the property dualist can explain\nwhy the most direct way to get familiar with a quale is by having an\nexperience of the relevant kind while the physicalist does not have\nany explanation for this particular feature of qualia. Similarly,\nRobert Howell (2007, 146) argues that all other physicalist responses\nto the Knowledge Argument depend upon the Acquaintance Hypothesis, and\nthat acquaintance is incompatible with objectivism (see Section 4.9\nbelow).\n\nIt is interesting to see that one version of the New Knowledge/Old\nFact View is very similar in spirit to the Acquaintance Hypothesis.\nBigelow and Pargetter (1990) argue that Mary\u2019s progress after release\nconsists in the fact that she now stands in a new acquaintance\nrelation to color qualia, but their theory about the individuation of\nbeliefs implies that she thereby acquires new factual knowledge.\nDifferent beliefs, according to Bigelow and Pargetter, can be\ndistinguished appropriately only if one takes into consideration the\nway the subject is acquainted with the individuals and properties her\nbelief is about (they use the technical term \u201cmodes of\nacquaintance\u201d in that context).\n",
