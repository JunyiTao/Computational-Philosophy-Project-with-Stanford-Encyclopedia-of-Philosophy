    "main_text": "Implications of the Distinction || Scriptural Hermeneutics\n5.3 Normative Implications\nIn addition to contentful philosophical implications, the distinction between primary and secondary meaning has an impact on how philosophy is done. For instance, NS 1.2.10ff, in outlining the appropriate terms of philosophical debate, defines the flaw of casuistry (vim\u0101\u1e43sa) as misusing words to mislead one\u2019s opponent. There are a number of types of casuistry, one of which is figurative. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, in his commentary (NBh 1.2.14), cites one of the stock examples of secondary meaning of the indicative type: \u201cThe stands are shouting.\u201d Here, where the meaning is that people seated on wooden structures are shouting, it would be casuistry to reply, \u201cNo, the stands are not shouting, but the people are shouting.\u201d This overly literal interlocutor pretends to misunderstand the speaker\u2019s intention, and makes there to be conflict when there is none. Whether or not this kind of debate flaw is an importantly unique kind of casuistry (there is some discussion about this in the commentaries), Ny\u0101ya philosophers emphasize that verbal hair-splitting without charity towards one\u2019s debate opponent constitutes a condemnable manner of intellectual speech (NS 1.2.2, Todeschini 2010).\nWe have already seen in section 4.2 that Jainas emphasize careful speech using the ordinary, not figurative, meanings of words. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 has a similar emphasis on correct speech, especially in the context of Vedic rituals. The utterances of mantras\u2014parts of the Veda which accompany ritual practice\u2014had to be performed precisely in order to guarantee the efficacy of the procedure (and mispronunciation in a ritual context was equal to sinful lying). Thus the study of grammatical rules was important, as these included pronunciation and modification of words to fit a new context (declining nouns into the plural, adjusting utterances to incorporate different deity names, and so forth). Further, grammar was a corrective to ordinary use, which is only an imperfect a guide to correct interpretation of Vedic words. Distinguishing between commands in the primary sense of words and figurative language exhortations was also crucial for M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, since the proper interpretation of the latter was relevant for the performance of the ritual. For example, the exhortation, \u201cThe grass-bedding is the ritual patron\u201d (TV 1.4.13) is a case of secondary meaning of the qualitative type (gau\u1e47av\u1e5btti), which praises the central role of the ritual patron. Kum\u0101rila observes that misunderstanding this meaning would lead to absurdity, since the grass-bedding (a woven mat of grass on which ritual implements are placed) is burned up\u2014and taking the phrase literally would mean putting an early stop to the ritual process if the patron himself were burned (Harikai 2017).\nFinally, Aesthetics interweaves normative implications throughout. Poetry is not merely for pleasure, but incorporates moral figures (one is instructed to be like R\u0101ma, the hero of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, and not like R\u0101va\u1e47a, the evil demon) and presupposes an entire moral structure. Abhinavagupta, in his independent works, takes up the theory of suggestion into the philosophy of Kashmir \u015aaivism, a tantric tradition which devotes itself to the deity \u015aiva. For Abhinavagupta, rasa is not merely an aesthetic phenomenon, but it is a profound sense of unity with transcendent reality, found in the rasa of peacefulness (\u015b\u0101nti) which encompasses all others. Still, one need not go so far as Abhinavagupta\u2019s work to see the normative dimension in Aesthetics, since even in \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s more ordinary understanding of rasa, there are certain emotions which are appropriate to bring into existence, and others which ought to be avoided. What is appropriate is dependent on the character\u2019s social position, gender, and so on. These norms also constrain the interpretive possibilities of suggested meaning, providing a conventional basis for the creative use of language.\n",
