    "main_text": "Teleology || Nature as a System of Purposes\n3.5 Nature as a System of Purposes\n\nKant is concerned with the role of teleology in our understanding not\nonly of individual organisms, but also of other natural things and\nprocesses, and of nature as a whole. Experience presents us with many\ncases in which features of a living thing\u2019s environment, both\norganic and inorganic, are beneficial or indeed necessary to it: for\nexample rivers are helpful to the growth of plants, and thus\nindirectly to human beings, because they deposit soil and thus create\nfertile land (\u00a763, 367); grass is necessary for cattle and other\nherbivorous animals, which in turn provide food for carnivores\n(\u00a763, 368). Kant makes the negative point (a version of which he\nhad earlier argued at length in the Only Possible Argument for the\nExistence of God of 1763) that we can understand these\narrangements without appeal to purposes. We can account for the origin\nof rivers mechanically, and even though grass must be regarded as an\npurpose on account of its internal organization, we do not need to\nappeal to its usefulness to other living things in order to comprehend\nit. However, he does hold that the natural objects figuring in these\nuseful arrangements have a type of purposiveness, namely outer or\nrelative purposiveness. They can be counted as purposive in this\nrelative sense as long as the thing to whose existence they contribute\nis a living thing, and hence has inner purposiveness (this condition\nis stated most clearly at \u00a782, 425).\n\nThe idea of the outer or relative purposiveness of one natural thing\nfor another, which is made possible by the idea of a natural purpose,\nin turn makes possible the idea of nature as a system of purposes,\nwhere everything in nature is teleologically connected to everything\nelse through relations of outer purposiveness. Kant puts this by\nsaying that the concept of a natural purpose \u201cnecessarily leads\nto the idea of all of nature as a system in accordance with the rule\nof purposes\u201d (\u00a767, 379), but he also puts the point more\nweakly by saying that the step from the idea of a natural purpose to\nthat of nature as a whole as a system of purposes is one which we\n\u201cmay\u201d [d\u00fcrfen] make (\u00a767, 380). This\ndoes not mean that we are entitled, still less required, to ascribe an\nintentional cause to purposive arrangements in nature, but it does\nallow us to think of them as standing not only in a mechanical, but\nalso in a teleological order. The thought of such a teleological order\nin turn leads to two further ideas: the idea of the ultimate\npurpose [letzter Zweck] of nature, which is something\nwithin nature for whose sake all other things within nature exist\n(\u00a782, 426ff), and the idea of the final purpose\n[Endzweck] of nature, which is something outside of nature\nfor whose sake nature as a whole exists (\u00a767, 378f.; \u00a784,\n434ff.). While experience does not allow us to identify either\nnature\u2019s ultimate purpose or its final purpose, Kant argues on\na priori grounds that the final purpose of nature can only be\nman considered as a moral subject, that is, considered as having the\nsupersensible ability to choose purposes freely (\u00a784, 435). To\nconsider man in this way is to conceive him as noumenon, rather than\nas part of nature. But human beings are capable of realizing their\nnoumenal freedom only in virtue of their capacity, as natural beings,\nto set themselves purposes and to use nature to fulfil them. Kant\ncalls the development of this capacity \u201cculture\u201d, and\ntakes it to require the acquisition both of specific abilities\n(\u201cculture of skill\u201d) and of the ability to make choices\nwithout being influenced by the inclinations to enjoyment stemming\nfrom our animal nature (\u201cculture of discipline\u201d). Culture\nis the ultimate purpose of nature because it prepares man for what he\nmust do in order to be the final purpose of nature (\u00a783,\n431).\n\nKant\u2019s views about the teleology of nature are discussed in\nGuyer 2001b and 2014 and Watkins 2014; the latter offers a very\nhelpful discussion of Kant\u2019s justification for the extension of\nhis views about teleology in individual organisms to nature as a\nwhole. See also A. Cohen\u2019s (2006) discussion of the relation\nbetween Kant\u2019s views on the generation of organisms and his\nconception of the final purpose of nature. N. Fisher (2019)\nunderstands human freedom as an example of the \u201cteleological\nlawgiving\u201d responsible for the purposiveness of both organisms\nindividually and nature as a whole, and uses this as the basis for an\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s argument that the final purpose of\nnature is human beings insofar as they are free.\n",
