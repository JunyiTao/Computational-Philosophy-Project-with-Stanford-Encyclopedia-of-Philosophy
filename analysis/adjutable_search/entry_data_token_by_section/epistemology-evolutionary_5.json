However, recent empirical\ninvestigations by psychologists, cognitive ethologists, cognitive\nneuroscientists and animal behaviorists have revealed that animals,\nboth primates and non-primates, have much more sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities than were previously suspected (Panksepp 1998, Heyes and\nHuber 2000, Rogers and Kaplan 2004, Lurz 2011, van Schaik 2010). From\nan evolutionary perspective this is not surprising given the shared\nevolutionary heritage that all animals share. Taking Darwin seriously\nmeans reconsidering and reassessing the nature of human knowledge in\nthe light of our increased awareness of the cogntive capabilities of\nthe members of other species. In addition, once a firm empirical basis\nof the scope and limits of animal cognitive capacities has been\nestablished we will be in a position to reassess our philosophical\nevaluations of the mental lives of animals and their epistemic and\nmoral status as well. Further field research promises to revolutionize\nour understanding of the sense in which human beings are one among the\nanimals.\n\nThe KLI Theory Lab of the Konrad Lorenz Institute publishes a journal\ndevoted to issues in evolutionary epistemology in addition to other\napplications of biological theory,\n Biological Theory: Integrating Development, Evolution and Cognition.\n",
