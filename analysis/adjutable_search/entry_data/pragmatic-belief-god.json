    "main_text": "\n1. Pragmatic Arguments\n\nAs with so much in philosophy, the first recorded employment of a\npragmatic argument is found in Plato. At Meno 86b-c, Socrates\ntells Meno that believing in the value of inquiry is justified because\nof the positive impact upon one\u2019s character:\n\n\nMeno: Somehow or other I believe you are right.\n\nSocrates: I think I am. I shouldn\u2019t like to take my oath on the\nwhole story, but one thing I am ready to fight for as long as I can,\nin word and act \u2013 that is, that we shall be better, braver, and\nmore active men if we believe it right to look for what we don\u2019t\nknow than if we believe there is no point in looking because what we\ndon\u2019t know we can never discover.\n\nMeno: There too I am sure you\n are.[1]\n\n\nParaphrased, Socrates\u2019 point is if being better, braver, and\nmore active are among our desires, and if believing that inquiry is\nworthwhile facilitates our becoming better, braver, and more active,\nthen we have reason, pragmatic reason, to believe that inquiry is\nworthwhile. Socrates\u2019 argument is an argument for the\npermissibility of a certain belief, based on the benefits of believing\nthat certain belief. Pragmatic arguments are practical in orientation,\njustifying actions that are thought to facilitate the achievement of\nour goals, or the satisfaction of our desires. If among your goals is\nA, and if doing such and such results in your achieving\nA, then, all else being equal, you have reason to do such and\nsuch:\n\nDoing \u03b1 brings about, or contributes in bringing about,\n\u03b2, and\nIt is in your interest that \u03b2 obtain. So,\nYou have reason to do \u03b1.\n\n\nAs presented this is a particular kind of pragmatic argument, a\nprudential argument. Prudential pragmatic arguments are predicated\nupon one\u2019s preferences or goals or self-interest. As we will\nsee, there are pragmatic arguments that are not narrowly prudential\nbut are moral in nature.\n\nPragmatic arguments are relevant to belief-formation, since\ninculcating a belief is an action. There are, broadly speaking, two\nkinds of pragmatic arguments that have to do with belief-formation.\nThe first is an argument that recommends taking steps to believe a\nproposition because, if it should turn out to be true, the benefits\ngained from believing that proposition will be impressive. This first\nkind of pragmatic argument we can call a \u201ctruth-dependent\u201d\npragmatic argument, or more conveniently a\n\u201cdependent-argument,\u201d since the benefits are obtained only\nif the relevant state of affairs occurs. The prime example of a\ndependent-argument is a pragmatic argument that uses a calculation of\nexpected utility and employs the Expectation Rule to recommend\nbelief:\n\nwhenever both probability and utility values are known, one should\nchoose to do an act which has the greatest expected utility.\n\n\nAmong the various versions of his wager argument, Pascal employs this\nRule in a version which states that no matter how small the\nprobability that God exists, as long as it is a positive, non-zero\nprobability, the expected utility of theistic belief will dominate the\nexpected utility of disbelief. Given the distinction between (A)\nhaving reason to think a certain proposition is true, and (B) having\nreason to induce belief in that proposition, taking steps to generate\nbelief in a certain proposition may be the rational thing to do, even\nif that proposition lacks sufficient evidential support. The benefits\nof believing a proposition can rationally take precedence over the\nevidential strength enjoyed by a contrary proposition; and so, given\nan infinite expected utility, Pascal\u2019s Wager contends that\nforming the belief that God exists is the rational thing to do, no\nmatter how small the likelihood that God exists.\n\nThe second kind of pragmatic argument, which can be called a\n\u201ctruth-independent\u201d pragmatic argument, or more\nconveniently, an \u201cindependent-argument,\u201d is one which\nrecommends taking steps to believe a certain proposition simply\nbecause of the benefits gained by believing it, whether or not the\nbelieved proposition is true. This is an argument that recommends\nbelief cultivation because of the psychological, or moral, or\nreligious, or social, or even the prudential benefits gained by virtue\nof believing it. In David Hume\u2019s Dialogues Concerning\nNatural Religion, for example, Cleanthes employs an independent\nargument, \u201creligion, however corrupted, is still better than no\nreligion at all. The doctrine of a future state is so strong and\nnecessary a security to morals that we never ought to abandon or\nneglect it\u201d (Hume 1776, 87). Perhaps the best-known example of\nan independent-argument is found in William James\u2019s celebrated\n\u201cWill to Believe\u201d essay in which he argues that, in\ncertain circumstances, it is rationally and morally permissible to\nbelieve a proposition because of the benefits thereby\n generated.[2]\n\nUnlike independent pragmatic arguments, dependent ones are, in an\nimportant sense, truth-sensitive. Of course, being pragmatic\narguments, dependent-arguments are not truth-sensitive in an\nevidential sense; nevertheless they are dependent on truth since the\nbenefits are had only if the recommended belief is true. In contrast,\nindependent pragmatic arguments, yielding benefits whether or not the\nrecommended beliefs are true, are insensitive to truth.\nIndependent-arguments, we might say, are belief-dependent and not\ntruth-dependent.\n\nTheism is the proposition that God exists. A theist is anyone\nwho accepts or believes that proposition. In this entry we limit\nourselves to pragmatic arguments concerning Theism \u2013 whether pro or\ncon \u2013 and skip over pragmatic arguments for non-theistic religions. A\ntheistic pragmatic argument contends that there are practical,\nprudential, or moral reasons for inculcating theistic belief. An\natheistic pragmatic argument holds that there are practical,\nprudential, or moral reasons for denying Theism.\n2. Moral Arguments as Pragmatic Arguments\n\nPragmatic arguments in support of theistic belief can either be\npredicated on prudence or on morality. By pragmatic arguments\npredicated on morality I mean arguments that contend that morality, or\nsome proper part of morality, presupposes, or is facilitated by\ntheistic belief. And if morality, or the proper part of morality, is\nrational, then so too is theistic belief. Put\n generally:[3]\n\nDoing \u03b1 helps to bring about \u03b2, and\nIt is morally desirable that \u03b2. So,\nIt is prima facie morally desirable to do \u03b1.\n\n\nSince (4) specifies actions, we should understand accepting theistic\npropositions as actions, even if believing is not an action (for more\non the distinction between acceptance and belief, see the section,\n\u201cPragmatic Arguments and Belief,\u201d below).\n\nIt is important to recognize the distinction between theoretical moral\narguments for theism (arguments intended to show that God exists), and\npragmatic moral arguments for the rationality of theistic belief.\nGeorge Mavrodes, for instance, constructs a theoretical moral argument\nby contending that it would be extremely odd that we would have moral\nobligations the fulfillment of which results in a net loss to the\nagent. Such a world seems absurd (Mavrodes, 1986). His argument is\nbuilt upon the idea of a Russellian world, a universe in which mental\nevents are products of non-mental events, and in which there\u2019s\nno human post-mortem survival, and extinction is the final end of\nevery biological species. A Russellian world implies atheism.\nSummarized, Mavrodes\u2019 argument is that there are real moral\nobligations in the actual world. But, real moral obligations would be\nabsurd in a Russellian world, since fulfilling moral obligations often\ncause a net loss to the moral agent and there is no deep explanation\nof real moral obligation in a Russellian world (the deep features of a\nRussellian world would be things like forces and atoms and chance).\nBut, fulfilling moral obligation is not absurd. So, in this respect,\nthere is reason to think that the actual world is not a Russellian\nworld.\n\nTwo examples of pragmatic moral arguments are Adams (1979) and\nZagzebski (1987). Adams builds his argument on the concept of\ndemoralization \u2013 weakening of moral motivation \u2013 and the\nconcept of a moral order \u2013 roughly, the idea that to achieve a\nbalance of good over evil in the universe requires something more than\nhuman effort, yet human effort can add or detract from the total value\nof the universe. While we cannot do it all on our own, the idea is, we\ncan make a significant difference for better or worse. In short,\nAdam\u2019s argument is that it is demoralizing not to believe that\nthere is a moral order in the universe, and demoralization is morally\nundesirable. So, there is moral advantage in accepting that there is a\nmoral order, and theism provides the best account of why that is.\nHence, there\u2019s moral advantage in accepting theism.\n\nZagzebski builds her argument upon the ideas of moral skepticism and\nmoral efficacy, and, though she does not employ the term, moral order.\nMorality is efficacious if we can make significant contributions to\nthe production of good in the universe and to the elimination of evil.\nMoral skepticism is a doubting of our ability to acquire moral\nknowledge, and a doubting of moral efficacy. Zagzebski argues that it\nis rational to try to be moral only if it is rational to believe that\nthe probability that the attempt will succeed and will produce a great\ngood is not outweighed by the probability that one will have to\nsacrifice goods in the course of the attempt. But given what we know\nof human abilities and history, it is not rational to believe that the\nattempt to be moral is likely to succeed if there is no moral order.\nSince it is rational to try to be moral, it is rational to believe\nthat there is moral order in the universe, and Christian doctrine is,\nin part, an account of there being a moral order in the universe. So,\naccepting Christian theism is more rational than accepting that\nthere\u2019s no moral order in the universe.\n\nTheistic moral pragmatic arguments may face an objection similar to\nthe many-gods objection to Pascal\u2019s wager. The many-gods\nobjection contends that the betting options of the wager are not\nlimited to Christianity and atheism alone, since one could formulate a\nPascalian Wager for Islam, certain sects of Buddhism, or for any of\nthe competing sects found within Christianity\n itself.[4]\n A similar problem arises for theistic moral pragmatic arguments, at\nleast insofar as those arguments are intended to provide strong\nsupport for theistic belief. Let\u2019s say that a pragmatic argument\nprovides strong support for theism just in case it provides reason for\nthinking that theism alone provides the benefit; and let\u2019s say\nthat a pragmatic argument provides weak support for theism just in\ncase it provides reason for thinking that theism is just one of\nseveral alternatives in providing the benefit. Pascal\u2019s Wager,\nfor instance, is intended to provide strong support for theism; while\nJames\u2019s Will to Believe argument is intended to provide weak\nsupport. Pragmatic moral arguments, if they are to provide strong\nsupport for theism, must provide reason to think that theistic belief\nalone is necessary for morality, or that theistic belief best\nfacilitates moral practice. But it\u2019s far from clear that\ntheistic belief exceeds its competitors in facilitating moral\npractice. Until reason for thinking that is forthcoming, it would be\npremature to hold that theistic moral pragmatic arguments provide\nstrong support.\n3. William James\u2019s Will to Believe Argument\n\nThe argument presented by William James (1842\u20131910) in his 1896\nessay, \u201cThe Will to Believe\u201d, extends far beyond the issue\nof the rationality of theistic belief to include various philosophical\nissues (for instance, whether to embrace determinism or\nindeterminism), and even matters of practical life. James\u2019s\nargument, in its attack on the agnostic imperative (withhold belief\nwhenever the evidence is insufficient), makes the general\nepistemological point that:\n\na rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent me from\nacknowledging certain kinds of truth if those kinds of truth were\nreally there, would be an irrational rule. (James 1896, 28)\n\n\nWe might understand the agnostic imperative more fully as follows:\n\nfor all persons S and propositions p, if S\nbelieves that p is just as likely as not-p, then it\nis impermissible for S to believe either p or\nnot-p.\n\n\nIf James is correct, then the agnostic imperative is false.\n\nThe foil of James\u2019s essay was W.K. Clifford (1845\u201379).\nClifford argued that:\n\n\u2026if I let myself believe anything on insufficient evidence,\nthere may be no great harm done by the mere belief; it may be true\nafter all, or I may never have occasion to exhibit it in outward acts.\nBut I cannot help doing this great wrong towards Man, that I make\nmyself credulous. The danger to society is not merely that it should\nbelieve wrong things, though that is great enough; but that it should\nbecome credulous, and lose the habit of testing things and inquiring\ninto them; for then it must sink back into savagery. (Clifford 1879,\n185\u20136)\n\n\nClifford presented evidentialism as a rule of morality: \u201cit is\nwrong always, everywhere, and for any one, to believe anything upon\ninsufficient evidence\u201d (Clifford 1879, 186). If Clifford\u2019s\nRule of morality is correct, then any one who believes a proposition\nthat she does not take to be more likely than not, is, thereby,\nimmoral. It may be worthwhile to note that Clifford\u2019s argument\nhere is itself a moral pragmatic argument.\n\nJames has two main\u00a0concerns in the \u201cWill To Believe\u201d\nessay. The first is to argue that Clifford\u2019s Rule is irrational\n(James 1896: 28). The second is that a theistic commitment is\npermissible.\u00a0James contends that Clifford\u2019s Rule is but one\nintellectual strategy open to us. A proponent of Clifford\u2019s Rule\nadvises, in effect, that one should avoid error at all costs, and\nthereby risk the loss of certain truths. But another strategy is to\nseek truth by any means available, even at the risk of error. James\nchampions the latter via the main argument of the \u201cWill to\nBelieve\u201d essay. To facilitate matters eight definitions employed\nby James are paraphrased:\n\nHypothesis: something that may be believed.\nOption: a decision between two hypotheses.\nLiving option: a decision between two live\nhypotheses.\nLive hypothesis: something that is a real candidate for\nbelief. A hypothesis is live, we might say, for a person just in case\nthat person lacks compelling evidence disconfirming that hypothesis,\nand the hypothesis has an intuitive appeal for that person.\nMomentous option: the option may never again present\nitself, or the decision cannot be easily reversed, or something of\nimportance hangs on the choice. It is not a trivial matter.\nForced option: the decision cannot be avoided.\nGenuine option: one that\u2019s living, momentous, and\nforced.\nIntellectually open: neither the evidence nor arguments\nconclusively decide the issue.\n\n\nThe first main argument might be sketched as follows:\n\nTwo alternative intellectual strategies are available:\n\n\nStrategy A: Risk a loss of truth and a loss of a vital good for\nthe certainty of avoiding error.\nStrategy B: Risk error for a chance at truth and a vital\ngood.\n \nClifford\u2019s Rule embodies Strategy A. But,\nStrategy B is preferable to Strategy A because Strategy A would\ndeny us access to certain possible kinds of truth. And,\nAny intellectual strategy that denies access to possible truths is\nan inadequate strategy. Therefore,\nClifford\u2019s Rule is unacceptable.\n\n\nJames asserts that \u201cthere are\u2026cases where a fact cannot\ncome at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming\u201d\n(James 1896, 25). Among other examples James provides of this\nparticular kind of truth is that of social cooperation:\n\na social organism of any sort whatever, large or small, is what it is\nbecause each member proceeds to his own duty with a trust that the\nother members will simultaneously do theirs. Wherever a desired result\nis achieved by the co-operation of many independent persons, its\nexistence as a fact is a pure consequence of the precursive faith in\none another of those immediately concerned. (James 1896, 24)\n\n\nAnd if James is right that there is a kind of proposition that has as\na truth-maker its being believed, what we might call \u201cdependent\ntruths,\u201d then proposition (9) looks well supported.\n\nOf course, accepting proposition (11), and advancing an alternative\nstrategy of seeking truth by any available means, even at the risk of\nerror, does not entail that anything goes. And an important part of\nJames\u2019s essay restricts what legitimately might be believed in\nthe absence of adequate evidence. Among the requirements suggested by\nJames the most important is:\n\nOnly genuine options that are intellectually open are decidable on\npassional grounds.\n\n\nJames is not arguing against conforming one\u2019s belief to the\nevidence, whenever there\u2019s a preponderance of evidence. Nor is\nhe arguing against the importance of evidence. His is an argument\ncontra the prohibition of believing whenever the evidence is silent, a\nprohibition implied by Clifford\u2019s Rule.\n\nThe requirement that an option is intellectually open may be\nredundant. If the evidence were compelling, or even strongly\nsupportive of, say, hypothesis a, and you recognized this, it\nmay be that you would find only a alive. Since you\u2019re\naware that the evidence strongly supports it, you would not find\nnot-a living. In other words, to say that an option is living\nmay imply that it is intellectually open. Nonetheless, let\u2019s\nproceed as if aliveness and openness are logically distinct notions.\nAdditionally, we might ask whether the property of intellectual\nopenness is to be understood as the evidence is lacking, or as the\nevidence is in principle lacking. That is, is an option intellectually\nopen when the evidence is indeterminate, or when it is essentially\nindeterminate? James\u2019s argument requires only the former. The\nlack of adequate evidence is sufficient to render an option\nintellectually open. If more evidence appears so that one hypothesis\nis supported by a preponderance of the evidence, then a commitment to\nabide by the evidence is triggered.\n\nThe relevance of all of this to theistic belief, according to James,\nis that:\n\nReligion says essentially two things. \u2026the best things are the\nmore eternal things, the overlapping things, the things in the\nuniverse that throw the last stone, so to speak, and say the final\nword\u2026. The second affirmation of religion is that we are better\noff even now if we believe [religion\u2019s] first affirmation to be\ntrue\u2026 The more perfect and more eternal aspect of the universe\nis represented in our religions as having personal form. The universe\nis no longer a mere It to us, but a Thou\u2026. We\nfeel, too, as if the appeal of religion to us were made to our own\nactive good-will, as if evidence might be forever withheld from us\nunless we met the hypothesis half-way. (James 1896, 25\u20137)\n\n\nJames asserts that there are two affirmations of religion. By\naffirmation James means something like an abstract claim, devoid of\nmuch doctrinal content, and found in the major religions. The first\naffirmation is that the best things are the more eternal things, while\nthe second is that we are better off even now if we believe the first\naffirmation. The first affirmation is particularly puzzling, since\nJames does not assert that the best things are the eternal things; he\nsays that the best things are the more eternal things. He\nexplicates this affirmation with three metaphors and a slogan:\n\u201cthe overlapping things, the things in the universe that throw\nthe last stone, so to speak, and say the final word. \u2018Perfection\nis eternal,\u2019 \u2013 this phrase of Charles Secr\u00e9tan seems\na good way of putting this first affirmation of religion\u201d (James\n1896, 25). Two ideas are suggested by James\u2019s explication:\nsovereignty and perfection. If we understand \u201cmore\neternal\u201d as a kind of necessity, or non-contingency, then\nperhaps the first affirmation may be understood as asserting that the\nbest things are those things that cannot fail to be sovereign and\nperfect. This interpretation resolves much of the first\naffirmation\u2019s puzzle. The plurality though is still puzzling. We\ncan resolve this puzzle by recognizing that, although he does not\nexplicitly call it a third affirmation, James asserts that \u201cthe\nmore perfect and more eternal aspect of the universe is represented in\nour religions as having personal form. The universe is no longer a\nmere It to us, but a Thou\u201d (James 1896, 26).\nIf we take this as a third affirmation of religion (perhaps at the\nrisk a charge of theistic parochialism), the possibility that the more\neternal things are plural is foreclosed. Monotheism, in other words,\nand not polytheism is established by the third affirmation. Taken\ntogether, then, the first and the third affirmations of religion\nsuggest that the supreme good in the universe is the existence of a\npersonal being that is essentially perfect and sovereign. The second\naffirmation is that we are better off now by believing in the\nexistence of this perfect being. At least in part, we would be better\noff now by believing the first affirmation because by doing so the\npossibility of a relationship with this being is established.\n\nAccording to James, just as one is not likely to make friends if one\nis aloof, likewise one is not likely to become acquainted with the\nperfect being, if there is such, if one seeks that acquaintance only\nafter sufficient evidence has been gathered. There are possible\ntruths, James claims, belief of which is a necessary condition of\nobtaining evidence for them. Let\u2019s call the class of\npropositions whose evidence is restricted to those who first believe\n\u201crestricted propositions.\u201d Dependent propositions and\nrestricted propositions are James\u2019s counterexamples to\nClifford\u2019s Rule. They are two examples of the kinds of truths\nthat Clifford\u2019s Rule would keep one from acknowledging. That is,\nClifford\u2019s Rule is problematic because following it would\npreclude access to restricted propositions and dependent propositions.\nThe Cliffordian may be forever cut off from certain kinds of\ntruth.\n\nOne might object that James has at best shown that theistic belief is\nmomentous only if God exists. If God does not exist, and, as a\nconsequence, the vital good of eternal life does not obtain, then no\nvital good is at stake. To answer this objection a Jamesian might\nfocus on what James calls the second affirmation of religion \u2013 we\nare better off even now if we believe \u2013 and take that affirmation\nto include benefits that are available, via pro-belief, even if God\ndoes not exist. In The Varieties of Religious Experience\nJames suggests that religious belief produces certain psychological\nbenefits:\n\nA new zest which adds itself like a gift to life, and takes the form\neither of lyrical enchantment or of appeal to earnestness and\nheroism\u2026. An assurance of safety and a temper of peace, and, in\nrelation to others, a preponderance of loving affections. (James 1902,\n475)\n\n\nIn any case, given that theism is intellectually open and that\nit\u2019s part of a genuine option, and given that there are vital\ngoods attached to theistic belief, James says, the hope that it is\ntrue is a sufficient reason to believe. In addition this objection is\neasily evaded if we revise the notion of a genuine option by removing\nthe requirement that an option is genuine only if momentous, although\nJames himself may have been loath to drop that requirement.\n\nJames\u2019s second main argument proceeds:\n\nThe decision whether to accept theism is a genuine option.\nAnd,\nTheism is intellectually open. And,\nThere are vital goods at stake in accepting theism. And,\nNo one is irrational or immoral in risking error for a chance at\ntruth and a vital good. So,\nOne may accept theism.\n\n\nWith this argument, James seeks to support the second of his two\nprimary concerns of his essay, that a religious commitment is\npermissible.\n\nAn objection commonly leveled against James\u2019s argument is that\n\u201cit constitutes an unrestricted license for wishful\nthinking\u2026 if our aim is to believe what is true, and not\nnecessarily what we like, James\u2019s universal permissiveness will\nnot help us\u201d (Hick 1990, 60). That is, hoping that a\nproposition is true is no reason to think that it is. A\nJamesian might contend that this objection is unfair. As we have\nnoted, James does not hold that the falsity of Clifford\u2019s Rule\nimplies that anything goes. Restricting the relevant permissibility\nclass to propositions that are intellectually open and part of a\ngenuine option provides ample protection against wishful thinking.\n\nA more significant objection contends that James\u2019s argument\nfails \u201cto show that one can have a sufficient moral reason for\nself-inducing an epistemically unsupported belief\u201d (Gale 1990,\n283). This objection contends that there is a weighty moral duty to\nproportion one\u2019s beliefs to the evidence, and that this duty\nflows from moral personhood \u2013 to be a morally responsible person\nrequires that one have good reasons for each of one\u2019s beliefs.\nBut to believe an epistemically unsupported proposition is to violate\nthis duty and is thus, in effect, a denial of one\u2019s own\n personhood.[5]\n Or think of it another way, as intellectual beings, we have the dual\ngoal of maximizing our stock of (significant) true beliefs and\nminimizing our stock of false ones. Clifford\u2019s Rule derives its\nmoral validity, one might contend, from that intellectual goal. And\nfrom Clifford\u2019s Rule flows our duty to believe only those\npropositions that enjoy adequate evidential support. James\u2019s\nargument would, if operative, thwart our intellectual goal by\npermitting us to violate Clifford\u2019s Rule. Can a morally and\nintellectually responsible person ever have a moral duty to believe a\nproposition that lacks adequate evidence, a duty that outweighs the\nalleged Cliffordian duty of believing only those propositions that\nenjoy adequate support? To answer this, let\u2019s employ what we\nmight call the \u201cET\u201d thought experiment. Suppose Clifford\nis abducted by very powerful and very smart extraterrestrials, which\noffer him a single chance of salvation for humankind \u2013 that he\nacquire and maintain belief in a proposition that lacks adequate\nevidential support, otherwise the destruction of humankind will\nresult. Clifford adroitly points out that no one can just will belief.\nThe ETs, devilish in their anticipation as well as their technology,\nprovide Clifford with a supply of doxastic-producing pills, which when\ningested produce the requisite belief for 24 hours. It\u2019s obvious\nthat Clifford would do no wrong by swallowing the pills and bringing\nabout a belief lacking adequate evidential\n support.[6]\n Moreover, since one is never irrational in doing one\u2019s moral\nduty, not only would Clifford not be immoral, he would not even be\nirrational in bringing about and maintaining belief in a proposition\nlacking adequate evidential support. As we mentioned earlier, given\nthe distinction between (A) having reason to think a certain\nproposition is true, and (B) having reason to induce a belief in that\nproposition, it may be that a particular proposition lacks sufficient\nevidential support, but that forming a belief in that proposition is\nthe rational action to perform.\n\nA very interesting objection to James\u2019s argument is that it\nfalls prey to the very principle it invokes against Clifford:\n\nJames writes: \u201cA rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent\nme from acknowledging certain kinds of truth if those kinds of truth\nwere really there would be an irrational rule\u201d. This may sound\nlike sweet reason itself, but a moment\u2019s reflection should\nconvince us that it is nothing of the kind. Any rule whatever that\nrestricts belief in any way might conceivably shut us off from some\ntruths. (Wood 2002, 24)\n\n\nAccording to James, Clifford\u2019s Rule is problematic because, if\nfollowed, it would preclude access to restricted propositions and\ndependent propositions. According to this objection, this alleged flaw\nof Clifford\u2019s Rule is true of any epistemic principle. Every\nepistemic principle that divides beliefs into those that are\npermissible and those that are not runs the risk of shutting off\naccess to certain possible kinds of truth. James\u2019s restriction\nof the permissible use of the passional nature only to when one faces\na genuine option that\u2019s intellectually open is just as guilty of\nthe alleged flaw as is Clifford\u2019s Rule. But an alleged flaw\nfound in every possibility is no flaw. Hence, James\u2019s objection\nto Clifford fails.\n\nThis objection is interesting since it is in one sense true.\nIt\u2019s obvious that any rule that restricts belief in any way\nmight shut us off from certain truths. Still, while interesting, this\nobjection is irrelevant. James\u2019s argument is not predicated on\nthe abstract proposition that \u201cany rule whatever that restricts\nbelief in any way might conceivably shut us off from some\ntruths.\u201d It is predicated on the principle that there are\ndependent propositions, and there are restricted propositions. His\nexamples of social trust, and acquiring friends, and of social\ncooperation are intended to make that clear. If theism were true, then\nit is very likely that there would be dependent propositions and\nrestricted propositions in that realm as well. Clifford\u2019s Rule\nwould preclude access to any restricted or dependent proposition,\nwhether religious or not. James is not arguing against conforming\none\u2019s belief to the evidence, whenever there\u2019s a\npreponderance of evidence. He is arguing against the prohibition of\nbelieving whenever the evidence is silent. Since James\u2019s\nargument specifies the irrationality of Clifford\u2019s Rule\u2019s\nexclusion of dependent and restricted propositions, and not just the\nabstract possibility of some kind of true belief or other being\nexcluded, it escapes this objection.\n\nWilliam Wainwright has argued that James\u2019s argument properly\nfits within an old Christian tradition, which asserts that:\n\nMature religious belief can, and perhaps should, be based on evidence\nbut\u2026 the evidence can be accurately assessed only by men and\nwomen who possess the proper moral and spiritual qualifications. This\nview was once a Christian commonplace; reason is capable of knowing\nGod on the basis of evidence \u2013 but only when one\u2019s cognitive\nfaculties are rightly disposed. (Wainwright 1995, 3).\n\n\nIf Wainwright is correct, then James\u2019s argument is not just a\npragmatic argument, but also an epistemic argument, since he is\narguing that one of the pragmatic benefits is a more reliable access\nto reality (see also the explication of James\u2019 argument via\ncontemporary epistemic utility theory in Pettigrew 2016). So, the\nchasm between the epistemic and the pragmatic is not unbridgeable,\nsince James\u2019s Will to Believe argument spans the gulf between\nthe pragmatic and the epistemic. Importantly, we should keep in mind\nthat whatever else it is, James\u2019s argument is, at least in part,\na pragmatic argument, and, moreover, James probably saw his argument\nas having a similar status as Pascal\u2019s Wager, since he offers a\npositive evaluation of the Wager, very often overlooked by\ncommentators, \u201cPascal\u2019s argument, instead of being\npowerless, then seems a regular clincher, and is the last stroke\nneeded to make our faith\u2026complete\u201d (James 1896, 11).\n4. J.S. Mill\u2019s License to Hope\n\nThe posthumous publication of Mill\u2019s Three Essays on\nReligion (1874) drew criticism from the faithful, but it also\ndrew a surprising disappointment from those who expected the\n\u201csaint of rationalism\u201d to argue for agnosticism. The cause\nof this consternation is found in the third of the three essays,\n\u201cTheism,\u201d a short work begun in 1868 and unfinished when\nMill died in 1870. The faithful found \u201cTheism\u201d\nobjectionable because of Mill\u2019s criticism of several of the\nstandard arguments of natural theology. The disappointment of the\nother side flowed from Mill\u2019s endorsement of a position that can\nbe summed up by the principle that where probabilities fail, hope can\nproperly flourish. As Mill expressed this principle when discussing\nimmortality, \u201c\u2026to any one who feels it conducive either\nto his satisfaction or to his usefulness to hope for a future state as\na possibility, there is no hindrance to his indulging that hope\u201d\n(Mill 1874, 210). Mill thought that belief in a creator of great but\nlimited power was supported by the design argument, and one could\ncertainly erect the superstructure of hope upon the base of a belief\nin a creator who would extend human existence beyond the grave:\n\nAppearances point to the existence of a Being who has great power over\nus \u2013 all the power implied in the creation of the Kosmos, or of\nits organized beings at least \u2013 and of whose goodness we have\nevidence though not of its being his predominant attribute; and as we\ndo not know the limits either of his power or of his goodness, there\nis room to hope that both the one and the other may extend to granting\nus this gift provided that it would really be beneficial to us. (Mill\n1874, 210)\n\n\nSince we do not know that granting postmortem existence to humans is\nbeyond the capability of the creator, hope is possible. As Mill puts\nit:\n\n\u2026in the regulation of the imagination literal truth of facts is\nnot the only thing to be considered. Truth is the province of reason,\nand it is by the cultivation of the rational faculty that provision is\nmade for its being known always, and thought of as often as is\nrequired by duty and the circumstances of human life. But when reason\nis strongly cultivated, the imagination may safely follow its own end,\nand do its best to make life pleasant and lovely\u2026 On these\nprinciples it appears to me that the indulgence of hope with regard to\nthe government of the universe and the destiny of man after death,\nwhile we recognize as a clear truth that we have no ground for more\nthan a hope, is legitimate and philosophically defensible. The\nbeneficial effect of such a hope is far from trifling. (Mill 1874,\n248\u20139)\n\n\nFor our purposes the item of interest is Mill\u2019s claim that\n\u201cany one who feels it conducive either to his satisfaction or to\nhis usefulness to hope for a future state as a possibility, there is\nno hindrance to his indulging that hope\u201d (Mill 1874, 210).\nMill\u2019s license to hope is issued on pragmatic grounds: it is\npermissible to hope if and only if:\n\nL1.\nFor all one knows or justifiably believes, the object of\none\u2019s hope obtains; and,\nL2.\nOne believes that hoping contributes to one\u2019s own happiness,\nor to the well-being of others.\n\n\nThe second condition (L2) is straightforwardly pragmatic and restricts\nhope to those who have goals either of personal happiness, or of\ncontributing to the well-being of others. Believing that hope will\nresult in the increase of happiness or well-being is a necessary\ncondition of permissible hope.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Mill agreed with Clifford\u2019s\nRule. Mill was no subjectivist or fideist. But hope and belief are not\nthe same; and the standards for the permissibility of the latter are\nconsiderably higher. Mill thought that (L1) and (L2) were the relevant\nstandards for permissible hope. If one believes that Clifford\u2019s\nRule should govern any and all propositional attitudes and not just\nbelief, then it is easy to see why Mill\u2019s liberal treatment of\nhope would disappoint.\n\nMill held that one may hope that God exists, but one may not believe\nthat God exists, as the evidence is lacking. Suppose one agrees with\nMill, that faith can subsist on hope, trust, or some other\nnon-doxastic attitude other than belief. Suppose further that one\nseeks to build a theistic commitment on hope. The acceptance of\ntheistic hope provides reason to act as if theism were true, not\nbecause one believes that it is true, but because one hopes that it\nis. What is it to act as if theism is true? It is to put into practice\nbehaviors characteristic of a particular religious tradition, such as\nJudaism, Christianity, or Islam. Acting as if a certain religious\ntradition were true would include reorienting one\u2019s values,\npriorities, and life-projects in order to reflect a commitment to a\nparticular tradition. It would also involve engaging in the rituals\nand behaviors associated with the particular tradition; and investing\na significant portion of one\u2019s time and money in support of\ncauses associated with the tradition.\n\nA problem arises however. Social psychology, with its theories of\nbiased scanning, social-perception theory, and cognitive dissonance\ntheory, advances the idea that behavior can alter, influence, and\ngenerate attitudes, including beliefs (see Jordan 2016). By regularly\nengaging in behaviors and practices characteristic of a particular\nreligious tradition, one engages in actions that tend to inculcate\nreligious belief. Belief is catching, as associating with and\nimitating the faithful is an effective way of self-inducing the\nbeliefs of the faithful. Those who seek to replace belief with hope\nwill find themselves taking steps to build a theistic commitment on\nhope, while holding that they ought to avoid theistic belief. Yet, the\nvery steps involved in fostering a commitment on hope \u2013\nimmersive role-playing as a theist, or acting as if theism were true\n\u2013 tend to generate theistic belief. Those who habitually or\nchronically imitate the actions and rituals of theists find eventually\nthat those are not just tasks they perform, but are at the heart of\nwho they are and what they believe. Yet, theistic belief is\noff-limits.\n\nOne would have to take steps that inoculate against the contagious\ntheistic belief. Yet, the reasons one has to build a theistic\ncommitment on hope and not belief, would conflict with one\u2019s\nreasons to inoculate against catching belief. One is pushed to act as\nif theism were true, yet pulled to act to ensure that one does not\ncome to believe that it is. Whatever commitment might emerge out of\nthis dynamic is not likely one characteristic of a mature or\nwholeheartedly committed theist.\n\nThis problem of catching belief flows out of the fact that chronically\nacting as if something is true is an effective way of inculcating the\nbelief that it is true. Any non-doxastic account of faith put into\nregular practice, coupled with Clifford\u2019s Rule, is exposed to\nthe problem of catching belief. Religious Fictionalism, for example,\nwhich holds that faith that p does not require belief that\np, has to deal with the problem. For more discussion, see\nMalcolm and Scott 2017, and Jordan 2016.\n5. Consolation and Needs-based Arguments\n\nIn 1770 James Beattie (1735\u20131803) published a long response to\nHume entitled An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, in\nOpposition to Sophistry and Scepticism. The essay was a 300 page\nbest seller, which, most commentators agree, was unfair in many\nrespects to Hume. As was his practice, Hume never made an effort to\nanswer Beattie in public; in correspondence, however, Hume referred to\nBeattie as that \u201cbigoted silly\n fellow.\u201d[7]\n\nDespite the general weakness of many of his arguments Beattie does\noffer an interesting pragmatic moral objection to Hume\u2019s attack\non religious belief:\n\n\u2026they perhaps have little need, and little relish, for the\nconsolations of religion. But let them know that, in the solitary\nscenes of life, there is many an honest and tender heart pining with\nincurable anguish, pierced with the sharpest sting of disappointment,\nbereft of friends, chilled with poverty, racked with disease, scourged\nby the oppressor; whom nothing but trust in Providence, and the hope\nof a future retribution, could preserve from the agonies of despair.\nAnd do they, with sacrilegious hands, attempt to violate this last\nrefuge of the miserable, and to rob them of the only comfort that had\nsurvived the ravages of the misfortune, malice, and tyranny! Did it\never happen, that the influence of their execrable tenets disturbed\nthe tranquility of virtuous retirement, deepened the gloom of human\ndistress, or aggravated the horrors of the grave? Is it possible that\nthis may have happened in many instances? Is it probable that this\nhath happened, or may happen, in one single instance? \u2013 ye\ntraitors to human kind, how can ye answer for it to your own hearts?\n(Beattie 1776, 322\u201323).\n\n\nBeattie argues that Hume\u2019s clear cutting of the theistic forest\nin his attack on the credibility of miracle reports, his criticism of\nthe design argument, and his attack on the cosmological argument\nresulted in a desolated landscape that does a serious disservice to\nhumankind. Since in some cases, Beattie contends, despair flows from\nthe loss of faith. And he assumes that no justifying good exists for\nHume to risk causing despair.\n\nLet\u2019s understand desolation as a profound sense of hopelessness\nand purposelessness. Beattie believed that Christian belief provided\nconsolation, especially to those suffering or oppressed. His argument\nmight be reconstructed as there exists a person S, such\nthat:\n\nTheistic belief provides the great good of consolation for\nS. And,\nS cannot receive a comparable good from any other source.\nAnd,\nThe deprivation of this good is a significant loss for S.\nSo,\nDepriving S of the great good of theistic belief renders\nS significantly worse-off. And,\nIt is wrong to render someone worse-off without compensation.\nAnd,\nPublic atheistic attacks provide S with no sufficient\ncompensation. Therefore,\nPublic atheistic attacks are wrong.\n\n\nWhile Hume never directly responded to Beattie\u2019s Consolation\nArgument, Mill had it (or something very much like it in mind) when he\nwrote:\n\nThat what is called the consoling nature of an opinion, that is, the\npleasure we should have in believing it to be true, can be a ground\nfor believing it, is a doctrine irrational in itself and which would\nsanction half the mischievous illusions recorded in history or which\nmislead individual life. (Mill 1874, 204)\n\n\nThis is an odd objection coming from one who argued in\nUtilitarianism \u201cactions are right in proportion as they\ntend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse\nof happiness.\u201d If the sole criterion of action is the production\nof happiness, and if forming a belief is an action, then it is hard to\nsee what answer could be lodged against Beattie\u2019s Consolation\nArgument (or at least some argument very much like\n it).[8]\n If happiness and consolation are irrelevant, and if Clifford\u2019s\nRule that \u201cit is wrong always, everywhere, and for any one, to\nbelieve anything upon insufficient evidence\u201d is correct, then\nBeattie\u2019s consolation argument can be rejected as being itself\nan immoral\n subornation.[9]\n\nAn argument similar to Beattie\u2019s consolation argument is found\nin a suggestive passage of John Henry Newman\u2019s 1870 An Essay\nin Aid of A Grammar of Assent, famously known as the\n\u201cfactory girl\u201d argument. Newman (1801\u20131890) did not\nformulate the \u201cfactory girl\u201d argument as a pragmatic\nargument, but the argument certainly lends itself to such a\nformulation:\n\n\nMontaigne was endowed with a good estate, health, leisure and an easy\ntemper, literary tastes, and a sufficiency of books; he could afford\nthus to play with life, and the abysses into which it leads us. Let us\ntake a case in contrast.\n\n\u201cI think\u201d, says the poor dying factory-girl in the tale,\n\u201cif this should be the end of all, and if all I have been born\nfor is just to work my heart and life away, and to sicken in this dree\nplace, with those mill-stones in my ears forever, until I could scream\nout for them to stop and let me have a little piece of quiet, and with\nthe fluff filling my lungs, until I thirst to death for one long deep\nbreath of the clear air, and my mother gone, and I never able to tell\nher again how I loved her, and of all my troubles, \u2013 I think, if\nthis life is the end, and that there is no God to wipe away all tears\nfrom all eyes, I could go mad!\u201d\n\n\nHere is an argument for the immortality of the soul (Newman 1870,\n299\u2013300).\n\n\nThis argument lends itself easily to a pragmatic cast since it places\ngreat weight on the idea that certain human needs support the rational\nand moral legitimacy of religious belief:\n\nWe have existential needs \u2013 a need for a deep meaning in\nlife, a need for hope, a need for cosmic security, a need for\nconsolation from despair \u2013 which are necessary for our\nwell-being. And,\nBelief in God satisfies these existential needs. So,\nBelief in God is overall justified.\n\n\nThis sort of argument faces many questions and issues that we cannot\nexplore here. Among these issues and questions are: suppose that one,\nmorally and rationally, may satisfy a need, it does not follow that\none can satisfy that need in any old way. Some ways of satisfying a\nneed are permissible while others are not. Is belief in God a\npermissible way? Do humans in fact have the alleged needs? Is belief\nin God the only feasible way to satisfy those needs? See Williams 2011\nfor further discussion.\n6. Pragmatic Arguments and Meaning in Life\n\n\nA popular pragmatic argument in support of theistic belief is built\nupon a saying erroneously attributed to Pascal that humans have a\ngod-shaped hole in their hearts that can be filled only by committing\nto God. Any finite filler will prove futile, pernicious or hollow.\nWhile Pascal nowhere mentions a god-shaped hole, in fragment 148 of the\nPens\u00e9es, he argues that,\n\n\nAll men seek happiness. There are no exceptions. \n\u2026 Yet for very many years no one without faith has ever\nreached the goal at which everyone is continually aiming. \n\u2026 A test which has gone on so long, without pause or change,\nreally ought to convince us that we are incapable of attaining the good\nby own efforts.\n\n\n\u2026 What else does this craving, and this helplessness,\nproclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness, of which all\nthat now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries in vain to\nfill with everything around him, seeking in things that are not there\nthe help he cannot find in those that are, though none can help, since\nthis infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable\nobject; in other words by God himself. (Pascal)\n\n\n\nThe argument suggested in fragment #148 is that faith in God alone\nprovides happiness, as theistic commitment alone results in happiness;\nwhile all other causes and commitments are chimera too small to fill\nthe hole in our lives. While Pascal wrote of happiness, his argument\nmight be re-focused toward meaning in life, perhaps by arguing that a\ngenuinely or truly happy life will be a meaningful life. Would the\nexistence of God make our lives meaningful? In this context\n\u201cmeaning in life\u201d is a life that makes a positive objective\ndifference in the world. As we have seen, a pragmatic argument in\nsupport of doing a particular action conforms to the general scheme\nthat:\n\nDoing \u03b1 brings about, or contributes in bringing about,\n\u03b2, and\nIt is in your interest that \u03b2 obtain. So,\nYou have reason to do \u03b1.\n\n\n\nSome have contended that inculcating a theistic commitment plays a\nvital role in bringing about meaning in one\u2019s life, whether as a\nsufficient condition or as an enhancement (for discussion see Metz,\n2019, and see Mawson, 2019). The view that a theistic commitment is\nrequired for meaning in life is voiced by W.L. Craig with his claim\nthat:\n\n\nIf God does not exist, then both man and the universe are inevitably\ndoomed to death. Man, like all biological organisms, must die. With no\nhope of immortality, man\u2019s life leads only to the grave. His life\nis but a spark in the infinite darkness, a spark that appears,\nflickers, and dies forever\u2026 If God exists, then\nthere is hope for man. But if God does not exist, then all we are left\nwith is despair. \u2026if God does not exist, then life\nis objectively meaningless; but man cannot live consistently and\nhappily knowing that life is meaningless\u2026 If God does not\nexist, then life is futile. If the God of the Bible does exist, then\nlife is meaningful. Only the second of these two alternatives enables\nus to live happily and consistently. Therefore, it seems to me that\neven if the evidence for these two options were absolutely equal, a\nrational person ought to choose biblical Christianity. It seems to me\npositively irrational to prefer death, futility, and destruction to\nlife, meaningfulness, and happiness. As Pascal said, we have nothing to\nlose and infinity to gain. (Craig 2013)\n\n\nAn argument hinted at in the passage above might be reconstructed\nas:\n\nA human life has objective meaning only if that life is\nunending. And,\nAn unending human life \u2013 immortality \u2013 is meaningful\nonly if God provides a purpose or point to that life. And,\nImmortality would not be surprising if God exists. So,\nHuman life has objective meaning only if God exists. And,\nThere are no dispositive reasons to deny Theism. And,\nThe value associated with one\u2019s life being meaningful is\nvery great. So,\nOne has pragmatic reason to cultivate a theistic commitment.\n\n\n\nThis argument rests on several controversial assumptions. For\none, the argument assumes that a divine conferral of purpose is\nnecessary for one\u2019s life to have meaning and purpose. Presumably,\nthe idea is that a self-conferral of purpose would be arbitrary and\nlimited by human ignorance or uncertainty as to what is genuinely\nworthwhile. A conferral by God, however, would not be arbitrary as God\nwould confer only a purpose that is objectively worthwhile. Another\nassumption is that objective meaning in life requires immorality. One\nmight respond that this assumption neglects that increasing the balance\nof objective value (good) to disvalue (evil) can make a real difference\nin the world, even if one lacks immortality. The actions of Lincoln\nmade the world better than it would have been absent those actions.\nArguably, then, Lincoln\u2019s life had meaning. More generally, the\nachievement of good works, or the mitigation of suffering and pain,\nmight be ways that an objective positive difference results from\none\u2019s actions. Here is where the stipulation of immortality is\nsupposed to play a role \u2013 if one knows that one\u2019s\nachievements are like footprints on a beach, which the tides of time\nwill eventually sweep away, a sense of futility is, one might argue,\nunavoidable, whether we admit this or not. Immortality is supposed to\nensure, along with the divine conferral of purpose, a permanence which\nevades futility. Finally, note that premise (31) is particularly\ncontentious, as some would argue that the problem of evil, the problem\nof divine hiddenness, or the lack of evidence supporting Theism, for\nexamples, puts Theism beyond the rational pale.\n\n\nWhile Craig holds that God and immortality are required for meaning\nin life, one could argue that even if not strictly necessary,\nimmortality and God would enhance the value and meaning of one\u2019s\nlife and that prospective enhancement is reason sufficient to hope that\nGod exists and for human immortality. All else being equal, if\none\u2019s achievements were to have an eternal positive effect that\ndoes seem more valuable than if they had a limited effect. Is hope\nmotivated by pragmatic reasons a sufficient basis upon which to erect\nthe superstructure of theistic commitment? With this question, we\nare back to issues concerning the permissibility of hope. There are\nthose who argue that the existence of God would render the world\nworse-off than if God did not exist. That we should hope that this is\nnot a God created universe. For example, see Kahane 2011, and the last\nsection of this entry for a discussion.\n7. The Ethics of Belief\n\nClifford\u2019s Rule is a vivid presentation of an influential and\nlong tradition in philosophy that carries the name of Evidentialism.\nWe can understand Evidentialism as the thesis that:\n\nE.\nFor all persons S and propositions p and times\nt, S ought to believe that p at t\nif and only if believing p fits S\u2019s evidence\nat t.\n\n\nClearly enough, pragmatic arguments run afoul of (E), since pragmatic\narguments are employed either when the evidence is inconclusive, or it\nis conclusively adverse. Consider the latter case first. Earlier it\nwas mentioned that Pascal\u2019s Wager is the most famous example of\na theistic pragmatic argument. Pascal in fact has not one version of\nthe Wager in his Pens\u00e9es (1660) but four. The third\nversion of the Wager is what Ian Hacking (1972) entitles the\n\u201cArgument from Dominating Expectation,\u201d and it employs the\nExpectation rule. We can represent it by letting p stand for\na positive probability greater than zero and less than one-half, and\nletting EU stand for \u201cexpected utility,\u201d and employing\nF2\u2013F4 as finite values:\n\n\n\n\nGod exists\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(p)\n~(God exists)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(1\u2212p)\n \n\nBelieve\np, \u221e\n1 \u2212 p, F2\nEU = \u221e \n\n~(Believe)\np, F3\n1 \u2212 p, F4\nEU = finite value  \n\n\nNo matter how unlikely it is that God exists, as long as there is some\npositive non-zero probability that he does, believing is one\u2019s\nbest bet:\n\nFor any person S, and alternatives \u03b1 and \u03b2\navailable to S, if the expected utility of \u03b1 exceeds\nthat of \u03b2, S should choose \u03b1. And,\nBelieving in God carries more expected utility than does not\nbelieving. Therefore,\nOne should believe in God.\n\n\nBecause of its ingenious employment of infinite utility, the third\nversion has become what most philosophers think of as Pascal\u2019s\nWager. The appeal of the third version for theistic apologists is its\nready employment as a worst-case device. Suppose there were a strong\nimprobability argument for atheism. With the third version the theist\nhas an escape: it can still be rational to believe, even if the belief\nis itself unreasonable, since inculcating theistic belief is an action\nwith an infinite expected utility. This use as a worst-case device is\nsomething like a trump card that can be thrown down defeating what had\nappeared as a stronger hand. Pascal\u2019s third version clearly\nviolates (E).\n\nNow consider James\u2019s Will to Believe argument. As we saw,\nJames\u2019s contention is that any hypothesis that\u2019s part of a\ngenuine option, and that\u2019s intellectually open, may be believed,\neven in the absence of sufficient evidence. No rule of morality or\nrationality, James argues, is violated if one accepts a hypothesis\nthat\u2019s genuine and open. If James is correct, then (E) should be\nreplaced with:\n\nE\u2032.\nFor all persons S and propositions p and\ntimes t, if believing p fits S\u2019s\nevidence at t, then S ought to believe that\np at t.\n\n\nAccording to (E\u2032) if the evidence is adequate, then the question\nis settled. If there\u2019s a preponderance of support for\np, then one is required to believe p. Where the\nevidence speaks, one must listen and obey. (E\u2032) differs from (E)\nin part since it says nothing about those occasions in which the\nevidence is silent, or is inadequate. If one assigns p a\nprobability of one-half, then there\u2019s not a preponderance of\nevidence in support of p. (E\u2032) says nothing about\nbelieving p in that case. Principle (E), on the other hand,\nforbids believing p in that case. While a proponent of\ntheistic pragmatic arguments cannot swear allegiance to (E), she can,\nclearly enough, adhere to (E\u2032). Let\u2019s call (E) Strong\nEvidentialism, and (E\u2032) Weak Evidentialism. So, an employer of\ntheistic pragmatic arguments can conform to Weak Evidentialism, but\nnot Strong Evidentialism.\n\nIs there a good reason to prefer Weak Evidentialism to Strong (in\naddition to James\u2019s argument)? A promising argument in support\nof the moral and rational permissibility of employing pragmatic\nreasons in belief-formation is erected upon the base of what we might\ncall the Duty Argument (or perhaps more precisely, the Duty\nArgument scheme):\n\nIt is necessary that (no one is (overall) irrational in doing what\nhe\u2019s morally obligated to do). And,\nIt is possible that (doing \u03b1 is a moral obligation).\nSo,\nIt is possible that (doing \u03b1 is (overall) rational).\n\n\nThe Duty Argument employs the box and diamond in the standard fashion\nas operators for, respectively, conceptual necessity and possibility.\nThe alpha is just a placeholder for actions, or kinds of actions. The\nlocution \u201c(overall) rational\u201d or \u201c(overall)\nirrational\u201d presupposes that there are various kinds of\nrationality, including moral rationality, epistemic rationality, and\nprudential\n rationality.[10]\n The idea that there are various kinds of rationality, or put any way,\nthat one can be under conflicting obligations at a particular time,\nrecognizes that dilemmas are possible. One can be obligated to do\nvarious things even when it\u2019s not possible to do all of them.\nOverall rationality is the all-things-considered perspective. It is\nwhat one ultimately should do, having taken into account the various\nobligations one is under at a particular time. Overall rationality, or\nall-things-considered rationality (ATC rationality), is, in W.D.\nRoss\u2019s terms, one\u2019s actual duty in the particular\ncircumstances, even if one has other conflicting prima facie\nduties. The Duty Argument can be formulated without presupposing that\nthere are various kinds of rationality, by replacing the principle\nthat no one is ever irrational in doing her moral duty, with\nthe principle that moral obligations take precedence whenever a\ndilemma of obligations occurs. In any case the Duty Argument\nassumes that if in doing something one is not ATC irrational, then it\nfollows that one is ATC rational in doing it.\n\nThe relevance of the Duty Argument is this. The action of forming and\nsustaining a belief upon pragmatic grounds can replace \u03b1. That\nis, pragmatic belief formation could be one\u2019s moral duty.\nConsider the following four cases in which pragmatic belief formation\nis, arguably, morally required:\n\n\nDevious ETs: Suppose you are abducted by very powerful and\nadvanced extraterrestrials, who demonstrate their intent and power to\ndestroy the Earth. Moreover, these fiendish ETs offer but one chance\nof salvation for humankind \u2013 you acquire and maintain a belief\nfor which you lack adequate evidence. You adroitly point out that you\ncannot just will such a belief, especially since you know of no good\nreason to think it true. Devilish in their anticipation and in their\ntechnology, the ETs produce a device that can directly produce the\nrequisite belief in willing subjects, a serum, say, or a supply of\none-a-day doxastic-producing pills. It is clear that you would do no\nwrong by swallowing a pill or injecting the serum, and, hence,\nbringing about and maintaining belief in a proposition for which you\nlack adequate evidence, done to save humankind. Indeed, it is clear\nthat you are in fact obligated to bring about the requisite belief,\neven though you lack adequate evidence for it.\n\nPain case: Jones knows that expecting an event to be painful is\nstrongly correlated with an increase in the intensity of felt pain (as\nopposed to having no expectation, or expecting the event to be\nrelatively painless). Jones is about to have a boil lanced, and\nbelieving that she is obligated to minimize pain, she forms the belief\nthat the procedure will be painless. She does so even though she lacks\nevidence that such procedures are in fact typically painless. Because\nof her action, the event is in fact less painful than it would\notherwise have been.\n\nSmall child: Suppose you are the parent or custodian of a small\nchild, who has been hurt. You know that studies support the thesis\nthat the felt pain reported by patients is typically higher in cases\nin which the patient expected the event to be painful than in cases\nwhere the patient did not have that expectation. You have no idea\nabout the relative pain associated with a particular medical procedure\nthat the child is about undergo. The child asks you if the procedure\nwill be painful. Desiring to lower the pain the child will feel, you\ntell the child that the procedure will not hurt, hoping that the child\nwill form a belief not supported by the evidence, but thereby lowering\nthe child\u2019s felt pain.\n\nDoctor case: Dr. Jones knows that the prognosis for\nSmith\u2019s recovery is poor, but if she acts on that knowledge by\ntelling Smith of his poor prognosis, she may well strip Smith of hope.\nJones believes that maintaining hope is vital for quality of life.\nOverall, Jones decides it is better not to inform Smith just how poor\nthe prognosis is and she does not disabuse Smith of her evidentially\nunsupported belief.\n\n\nThese four cases provide possible scenarios in which pragmatic belief\nformation, or suborning pragmatic belief formation in others, is\nmorally required.\n\nAlthough controversial, the Duty Argument, if sound, would provide\ngood reason for thinking that there are occasions in which it is\npermissible, both rationally and morally, to form beliefs based upon\npragmatic reasons even in the absence of adequate evidence. If the\nDuty Argument is sound, then (E) is false.\n\nThe Duty Argument presupposes that there are various kinds of\nrationality. Many Evidentialists, as well as many opponents of\nEvidentialism, also assume that there are various kinds of\nrationality. What if however there is only one kind or standard of\nrationality? What impact would that have on the debate? Susanna Rinard\nargues that it is best to reject the idea that there are various kinds\nor standards of rationality, and replace that idea with an equal\ntreatment idea that all states \u2013 whether doxastic or not \u2013\nface a single standard of rationality (Rinard 2017). Equal treatment\nof states \u2013 states like carrying an umbrella, or walking the\ndog, or voting for this candidate over that, or forming a belief in\nGod \u2013 provides greater theoretical simplicity than does the idea\nthat there are various standards or kinds of rationality. Equal\nTreatment also better explains the methodological attraction of\nsimplicity in science than does the idea that there are various kinds\nof rationality, Rinard argues. If the equal treatment of all states\nidea is correct, then doxastic states would face the same standard of\nrationality as states of action. The Equal Treatment idea provides an\nadditional objection to Evidentialism insofar as Evidentialism implies\nthat beliefs are subject to one standard, while other states are\nsubject to another standard.\n\nWhether it is via Rinard\u2019s Equal Treatment argument, or the Duty\nArgument, there is, arguably, good reason to reject Evidentialism.\n8. Pragmatic Arguments and Belief\n\nThe idea that persons can voluntarily and directly choose what to\nbelieve is called \u201cDoxastic Voluntarism\u201d. According to\nDoxastic Voluntarism, believing is a direct act of the will, with many\nof the propositions we believe under our immediate control. A basic\naction is an action that a person intentionally does, without doing\nany other action. Jones\u2019 moving of her finger is a basic action,\nsince she need not perform any other action to accomplish it. Her\nhanding the book from Smith to Brown is not basic, since she must\nintentionally do several things to accomplish it. According to\nDoxastic Voluntarism, some of our belief acquisitions are basic\nactions. We can will, directly and voluntarily, what to believe and\nthe beliefs thereby acquired are freely obtained and are not forced\nupon us. In short, one can believe at will. The proponent of Doxastic\nVoluntarism need not hold that every proposition is a candidate for\ndirect acquisition, as long as she holds that there are some\npropositions belief in which is under our direct control.\n\nIt is widely thought that Doxastic Voluntarism is implausible.\nOpponents of Doxastic Voluntarism can present a simple experiment\nagainst it: survey various propositions that you do not currently\nbelieve, and see if any lend themselves, directly and immediately, by\na basic act of the will, to belief. Certainly there are some beliefs\nthat one can easily cause oneself to have. Consider the proposition\nthat I am now holding a pencil. I can cause myself to believe that by\nsimply picking up a pencil. Or more generally, any proposition about\nmy own basic actions I can easily enough believe by performing the\naction. But my coming to believe is by means of some other basic\naction. Since I lack direct control over what I believe, and\nthere\u2019s no reason to think that my lacking in this regard is\nsingular, Doxastic Voluntarism is implausible. Does the implausibility\nof Doxastic Voluntarism show that pragmatic belief-formation is also\nimplausible?\n\nNot at all: think of Pascal\u2019s advice to act as if one already\nbelieves (by going to masses and by imitating the faithful) as a way\nof inculcating belief. Pragmatic belief-formation neither entails nor\npresupposes Doxastic Voluntarism. As long as there is indirect\ncontrol, or roundabout control, over the acquisition and maintenance\nof beliefs, pragmatic belief-formation is possible. What constitutes\nindirect control over the acquisition of beliefs? Consider actions\nsuch as entertaining a proposition, or ignoring a proposition, or\ncritically inquiring into the plausibility of this idea or that, or\naccepting a proposition. Each of these involves a propositional\nattitude, the adoption of which is under our direct control. Indirect\ncontrol occurs since accepting a proposition, say, or acting as if a\nproposition were true, very often results in believing that\nproposition. Insofar as there is a causal connection between the\npropositional attitudes we adopt, and the beliefs that are thereby\ngenerated, we can be said to have exercised indirect, or roundabout,\ncontrol over belief-formation.\n\nOne objection to the foregoing is that pragmatic arguments are, by and\nlarge, pointless because beliefs are, by their very nature,\npsychological states that aim for truth. That is, whenever one\nbelieves a proposition, one is disposed to feel that that proposition\nis probably the case. A person ordinarily cannot believe a proposition\nthat she takes to have a probability of less than one-half or whose\nprobability is uncertain since such propositional attitudes do not aim\nfor truth. The upshot of this objection is that strong evidentialism\nis unavoidable.\n\nIf it is true, as this objection holds, that believing a proposition\nordinarily involves being disposed to feel that the proposition is the\ncase then it does appear at first blush that pragmatic\nbelief-formation, as such, is ineffectual. But all that follows from\nthis fact, if such it be, is that some sort of belief-inducing\ntechnology will be necessary in order to facilitate the acquisition of\na proposition that is pragmatically supported. Now it is true that the\nmost readily available belief-inducing technologies \u2013\nselectively using the evidence for instance \u2013 all involve a\ndegree of self-deception, since one ordinarily cannot attend only to\nthe favorable evidence in support of a particular proposition while\nneglecting the adverse evidence arrayed against it and, being\nconscious of all this, expect that one will acquire that belief. The\nfact that self-deception is a vital feature of the readily available\nbelief-formation technologies leads to another objection.\n\nThis second objection is that willfully engaging in self-deception\nrenders pragmatic belief-formation morally problematic and rationally\nsuspect, since willfully engaging in self-deception is the deliberate\nworsening of one\u2019s epistemic situation. It is morally and\nrationally problematic to engage in pragmatic belief-formation,\ninsofar as belief-formation involves self-deception.\n\nThis second objection is powerful if sound, but we must be careful\nhere. First, while self-deception may be a serious problem with regard\nto inculcating a belief which one takes to be false, it does not seem\nto be a serious threat involving the inculcation of a belief which one\nthinks has as much evidence in its favor as against it, nor does it\nseem to be a threat when one takes the probability of the proposition\nto be indeterminate, since one could form the belief knowing full well\nthe evidential situation. Even if it is true that believing that p is\nbeing disposed to feel that p is the case, it does not follow\nthat believing that p involves being disposed to feel that p is\nthe case based on the evidence at hand. Second, this is an\nobjection not to pragmatic belief-formation per se, but an\nobjection to pragmatic belief-formation that involves self-deception.\nAlthough it may be true that the employment of self-deceptive\nbelief-inducing technologies is morally and rationally problematic,\nthis objection says nothing about those belief-inducing technologies\nthat do not involve self-deception. If there are belief-inducing\ntechnologies which are free of self-deception and which could generate\na belief on the basis of a pragmatic reason, then this objection\n fails.[11]\n\nIs there a belief-inducing technology available that does not involve\nself-deception? There is. Notice first there are two sorts of\nbelief-inducing technologies distinguishable: \u201clow-tech\u201d\ntechnologies and \u201chigh-tech\u201d ones. Low-tech technologies\nconsist of propositional attitudes only, while high-tech ones employ\nnonpropositional techniques along with various propositional\nattitudes. The nonpropositional techniques could include actions like\nacting as if a certain proposition were true, and morally questionable\nones like hypnosis, or indoctrination, or subliminal suggestion.\nConsider a technology consisting of two components, the first of which\nis the acceptance of a proposition, while the second is a behavioral\nregimen of acting on that acceptance. Accepting a proposition, unlike\nbelieving, is an action that is characterized, in part, by one\u2019s\nassenting to the proposition, whether one believes it or not. One\naccepts a proposition, when she assents to its truth and employs it as\na premise in her deliberations. One can accept a proposition that one\ndoes not believe. Indeed, we do this much of the time. For example,\nthink of the gambler\u2019s fallacy. One might be disposed to believe\nthat the next toss of the fair coin must come up Tails, since it has\nbeen Heads on the previous seven tosses. Nevertheless, one ought not\nto accept that the next toss of a fair coin must come up Tails, or\nthat the probability that it will is greater than one-half.\nAcceptance, we should remember, unlike believing, is an action that is\nunder our direct control.\n\nIf one accepts a proposition, then one can also act upon the\nproposition. Acting upon a proposition is behaving as though it were\ntrue. The two-step regimen of accepting a proposition and then acting\nupon it is a common way of generating belief in that proposition. And,\nimportantly, there is no hint of self-deception tainting the\nprocess.\n\nOne might object that employing a belief-inducing technology at all,\nwhether low or high tech, is enough to entangle one in issues\nimplicating the rationality of the belief induced (see, for instance,\nGarber 2009). A friend of the pragmatic, however, might argue\nthat that this objection presupposes Strong Evidentialism, and\narguments found in William James, the Duty argument, the Equal\nTreatment argument, have already provided a dispositive ruling on that\nissue.\n9. Atheistic Pragmatic Arguments\n\nWhile not as common as theistic arguments, there have been atheistic\npragmatic arguments offered from time to time. These arguments often\narise within the context of a purported naturalistic explanation of\nthe occurrence of religious belief and practice. Perhaps the earliest\nproponent of an atheistic pragmatic argument was David Hume\n(1711\u20131776). In chapter X of his 1757 The Natural History of\nReligion, Hume wrote:\n\nWhere the deity is presented as infinitely superior to mankind, this\nbelief \u2026 is apt, when joined with superstitious terrors, to sink the\nhuman mind into the lowest submission and abasement \u2026\n\n\nThe idea of Hume\u2019s argument here and elsewhere in his writings\n(see for instance Dialogue XII of his Dialogues Concerning Natural\nReligion, and appendix IV of the second Enquiry) is that theism,\nor at least theism of the popular sort \u2013 that conjoined with\n\u201csuperstitious terrors,\u201d degrades individual morality,\nthereby devaluing human existence. Theistic belief, Hume contended,\ninculcates the \u201cmonkish virtues of mortification, penance,\nhumility, and passive suffering, as the only qualities which are\nacceptable\u2026\u201d But not only does theistic belief harm\nindividual morality, according to Hume, it also harms public morality.\nIn chapter IX, Hume suggested that theism (again he qualifies by\nwriting of the \u201ccorruptions of theism\u201d) leads to\nintolerance and persecution.\n\nAnother atheistic pragmatic argument is that of Sigmund Freud\n(1856\u20131939), who in The Future of an Illusion (1927)\ncontends that religious belief perpetuates psychological immaturity\namong individuals, and cultural immaturity on the social level. To\nmake sense of Freud\u2019s argument requires knowing that he employed\nthe term \u201cillusion\u201d in an idiosyncratic way. An illusion\nin the Freudian sense is a belief that is caused by and in turn\nsatisfies a deep psychological need or longing. Illusions are not held\nrationally. Illusions stick even in the absence of any supporting\nevidence. Indeed, according to Freud, they stick even in the face of\nstrong contra-evidence. An illusion could be true, but often they are\nnot. Delusions are false illusions. Religious belief Freud thought was\nan illusion. While it may have been a beneficial illusion at an\nearlier time, it no longer is. The religious illusion now, Freud\nasserted, inhibits scientific progress, and causes psychological\nneuroses, among its other pernicious effects.\n\nAnother atheistic pragmatic argument is Richard Dawkins\u2019s\ncontention that religious belief is a \u201cvirus of the mind\u201d\n(Dawkins 1993). One is religious, according to Dawkins, because one\nhas been infected by a faith meme. A meme is Dawkins\u2019s\nimaginative construct, which he describes as a bit of information,\nmanifested in behavior, and which can be copied from one person to\nanother. Like genes, memes are self-replicating vehicles, jumping from\nmind to mind. One catches a meme by exposure to another who is\ninfected. Dawkins claims that the faith meme has the following\ntraits:\n\nM1.\nThe faith meme seems to the person as true, or right, or virtuous,\nthough this conviction in fact owes nothing to evidence or reason.\nM2.\nThe faith meme makes a virtue out of believing in spite of there\nbeing no evidence.\nM3.\nThe faith meme encourages intolerant behavior towards those who\npossess rival faiths.\nM4.\nThe faith meme arises not because of evidence but because of\nepidemiology; typically, if one has a faith, it is the same as\none\u2019s parents and as one\u2019s grandparents.\n\n\nDawkins\u2019s meme idea, and his dismissal of faith as a virus of\nthe mind, is both a purported naturalistic explanation of religious\nbelief and a pragmatic dismissal of it as a harmful phenomenon.\n\nA contemporary atheistic pragmatic argument is that the existence of\nGod would make the world far worse in some respects than would be the\ncase if God did not exist, even if it did not make the world worse\noverall (Kahane 2011). As Kahane notes, if God were to exist, then a\nfull understanding of reality by humans, may in-principle be\nunachievable. Additionally, if God were to exist, moral autonomy may\nbe limited, since humans, as creatures, might be subordinate to\nGod\u2019s demands, including demands for worship, obedience, and\nallegiance. Finally, if God were to exist, complete privacy may be\nlost, as an omniscient being could, presumably, know one\u2019s\nthoughts and attitudes.\n\nKahane\u2019s intricate argument is counter to the conventional view\nthat God\u2019s existence is something that all should hope for,\nsince this world would, arguably, be the best or among the best of all\npossible worlds if God were to exist. Even so, Kahane argues that one\ncould rationally prefer that God not exist. The argument involves a\ndistinction between evaluations from an impersonal viewpoint, and from\na personal viewpoint. It is the latter, which proves the most\npromising for the argument as Kahane contends that the existence of\nGod could undermine the meaning generating life-projects of some. If\nhis argument is sound, Kahane has provided a kind of atheistic\npragmatic argument that one could prefer that God not exist, even if\nGod\u2019s existence would render the world better overall than it\notherwise would be.\n\nMuch of Kahane\u2019s argument consists of comparisons between\npossible worlds in which God exists (\u201cGodly worlds\u201d), and\nthose in which God does not exist (\u201cGodless worlds\u201d). The\nmodal reliability of these comparisons is far from obvious, since God\nis standardly seen as a necessarily existing being. For a critical\nexamination of Kahane\u2019s arguments, see Kraay 2013.\n",
