    "main_text": "Explanation || Clinical Application\n3.6 Clinical Application\n\n\nPsychiatric models explain idealization of some sort. The point of it\nall, though, comes when that understanding lets us help patients.\nGuze (1992) calls this the move from the biological perspective to the\nclinical one. In making the move we shift from a general description\nof a disease process to a specific description of the biology of an\nindividual. The clinician takes the imaginary ideal patient and\nspecifies more real-world detail, so as to produce a description of a\nsmaller set of patients, perhaps even a single case. The scientific\nproject idealises, whereas the clinical one uses the resources of the\nscience to help individuals. In displaying causal relations that give\nrise to features of the model we present opportunities for therapeutic\naction, whether we have zoomed in or out. The model defines a set of\nrelations that differ from those present in a real patient along\nvarious dimensions. One is precision: the causal relations the model\nrepresents may need to be made more precise when we look at real\npatients. The degree to which a symptom is present, for example, might\nneed to be specified precisely in a clinical setting, whereas in the\nexemplar the symptom can be defined as inhabiting some range of\nvalues, any one of which might apply in nature. Or we can supply a\ndeterminate story that embraces the details of the beliefs and other\nintentional states of the patient, instead of just citing the fact\nthat a particular information-processing pathway is implicated in\npatients of that type. An important strand in recent philosophy,\nhowever, regards the key to successful understanding as humanistic or\nnon-reductive, and is skeptical about the chances of understanding\nmentally ill persons through the medium of research categories\ninspired by the medical model (Glover 2014: Tekin 2019) \n\nSupplement on Philosophical Psychopathology\n\n",
