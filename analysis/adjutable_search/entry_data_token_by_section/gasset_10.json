Perspectivism: Human Life, Vital Reason and Historicism\n\nThe doctrine of perspectivism expounds the proposition that all\nhistorical epochs participate in contributing an element of truth to\nreality. That is, each individual and each collection of individuals\napprehend reality from the point of view of their respective\nperceptions of reality. The varying perceptions of reality are all\nlegitimate and account for the postulate that different individuals\ninterpret the same \u201chorizon\u201d differently so that\n\u201cevery life is a point of view directed upon the\nuniverse\u201d (Obras, III: 200). Ortega\u2019s\n\u201cperspectivist\u201d postulate thus promised to perform the\nfunction of unifying reality. From the assumption that\n\u201cperspective\u201d comprises both \u201cone of the component\nparts of reality and its organizing element\u201d, Ortega arrived at\nthe position that \u201call knowledge is knowledge from a definite\npoint of view\u201d (Obras, III: 199). Hence every truth\nconnects to a place in space and time. In locating truth in space and\ntime, he derived both the mode of perception and the essence of\nreality.\n\nOrtega perceived in his perspectivist mode of apprehending reality a\nphilosophical analogue to Einstein\u2019s physics and, subsequently,\ninvited a comparison of his philosophy of perspectivism to Einstein\u2019s\nSpecial Theory of Relativity. Ortega\u2019s essay on \u201cThe Historical\nSignificance of Einstein\u2019s Theory\u201d pointed to parallel\ntendencies in new modes of twentieth century thinking and in\nEinstein\u2019s theory of relativity, which he characterized as \u201cthe\nmost important intellectual fact that the present can show\u201d\n(Obras, III: 231). In dissolving the entire edifice of\nclassical mechanics, Einstein\u2019s theory ushered in the twentieth\ncentury (the \u201cpresent time\u201d) very much in the manner that\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy prepared thought for the modern era\n(Obras, III: 231\u201334). Ortega\u2019s ideas on the historical\nsignificance of relativity were derived primarily from Einstein\u2019s\ndiscussion of the Special Theory. He was drawn to comparing the theory\nof relativity to his philosophy of \u201cperspectivism\u201d because\nrelativity appeared to furnish scientific \u201cproof\u201d of his\nown \u201cperspectivist truths\u201d, which were formulated in El\nEspectador in 1916 (Obras, III: 235; see also II:\n15\u201321).\n\nOrtega\u2019s perspectivist doctrine, as a synthetic principle, also\nimplied for him a doctrine by which one may \u201cattempt to order\nthe world from the point of view of life\u201d (Obras, III:\n179). The principle of human life, which constituted the reality of\nhuman experience, became the philosophical category through which\nOrtega synthesized the universe. Correspondingly, the \u201csign of\nthe times\u201d also pointed to the important role played by\nNietzsche, Croce, Dilthey and Heidegger, as well as Freud and Husserl,\nin the formation of twentieth-century thought. The emphasis placed\nupon the vital world of life took Ortega a step beyond the Neo-Kantian\ntranscendental logic of Cohen. Ortega combined his idea of human life\nwith an emphasis on history as constituting the vital dynamics of its\nexpression, and this viewpoint carried him closer to the humanistic\nside of the Naturwissenschaften-Geisteswissenschaften\ndistinction made by the Southwest German or Baden School and Dilthey\nthan to Cohen\u2019s Neo-Kantianism.\n\nThe striking similarities in the historicist focus of Windelband,\nRickert and Dilthey, the early historical thought of Croce, and the\nhistorical thought of Ortega suggest that Ortega was influenced by\ntheir ideas both directly and indirectly. The historical ideas of\nWindelband and Rickert reflected the European intellectual currents\nthat paralleled Ortega\u2019s intellectual development, Dilthey had been\nacknowledged by Ortega as having influenced his intellectual focus\ndirectly, and Croce\u2019s early historical ideas appeared to have exerted\ninfluence on the historical thought of Ortega.\n\nIn his essay, \u201cWilhelm Dilthey and the Idea of Life\u201d,\ntwenty\u2013seven years after his studies in Berlin, Ortega wrote of\nDilthey\u2019s importance in his intellectual development and his\nmisfortune of not having been exposed to the ideas of Dilthey earlier\nas a student:\n\n\nI became acquainted with Dilthey\u2019s work as late as 1929, and it took\nme four more years before I knew it sufficiently well. This ignorance,\nI do not hesitate to maintain, has caused me to lose about ten years\nof my life\u2014ten years, in the first place of intellectual\ndevelopment, but that of course, means an equal loss in all other\ndimensions of life\u2026. When I studied in Berlin in\n1906\u2026Dilthey happened to have given up lecturing in\nthe university building a few years before and admitted to courses he\nheld in home for only a few specially prepared students. Thus\nchance had it that I did not come in touch with him.\n(Obras, VI: 171\u201372)\n\n\nBy the late 1920s and the early 1930s, however, Ortega did incorporate\nthe idea of human life into his philosophic viewpoint. During these\nyears, he labeled his own philosophy as \u201cthe metaphysics of\nvital reason\u201d to signify his continuous search for a structure\nof life that would be transcendent in its relation to every existing\nreality, and yet itself located within the framework of temporal and\nspatial reality. Like Dilthey, whom he considered \u201cthe most\nimportant thinker of the second half of the nineteenth century\u201d,\nhe denied truth to any constant principle that establishes itself as\nsuperior to the flux of life, including that of the physical and\nbiological sciences. Dilthey\u2019s Lebensphilosophie, which\nemphasizes openness to experience, not only denies the notion of an\nabstract transcendental reality, but also considers life to be more\nthan mere biological organism. His concept of life is not biological,\nand in this sense, Ortega\u2019s notion of human life\nresembles Dilthey\u2019s. For Ortega, \u201cmy life\u201d\u2014in\nthe \u201cbiographical\u201d not in the \u201cbiological\u201d\nsense\u2014is the question of what to do with it and that of what\nhappens to me as I find myself \u201cshipwrecked\u201d in the\nprecarious sea of \u201ccircumstances\u201d. The individual, from\nthis point of view, saves himself by sinking into the inner depths of\nhis being as he makes an effort to hold on to consciousness and to the\nvery essence of his life. \u201cTo live\u201d, he maintained,\n\u201cis to deal with the world, aim at it, act in it, be occupied\nwith it\u201d (Obras, V: 26, 33\u201334, 35, 44\u201345,\nVII: 103\u201304). For Dilthey, life is realized empirically within\nthe experiential process of consciousness, as lived experience, which\ngives the experience of the individual life and reality. Dilthey\u2019s\nposition, like Bergson\u2019s, contains the vitalist viewpoint that our\nexperience of the life of our own minds is a direct experience of that\nlife, as it exists, and therefore cannot be perceived as some\nmechanistic physiological explanation of human organism or as some\nsubjective neo-idealistic logical principle. The emphasis on the\nactive, dynamic, and historical dimensions of human and social\nphenomena, as realized within the lived experiences of life, reveal\nthe vitalization of philosophy and the historicization of life\nperspective that are reflective of historicism and the attitude that\nhistorical knowledge is unique to the realm of human affairs.\n\nThis historicism comprises the perspective perceived in Ortega\u2019s\nnotion of the \u201cdynamic dialogue\u201d in the\n\u201cdrama\u201d of the life-world of the individual. Historicism\nis not used here in the polemical extreme characterized by Karl\nPopper\u2019s charge that historicism is incompatible with any form of\n\u201cgenuine science\u201d. In his The Poverty of\nHistoricism (1957), which describes and criticizes both\n\u201canti-naturalist\u201d and \u201cpro-naturalist\u201d\ndoctrines of historicism, Popper charges the former doctrine with\n\u201ctheology\u201d and \u201cholism\u201d and charges the latter\ndoctrine of advancing the notion that \u201chistorical\nprediction\u201d is their principal objective, something that\nbecomes attainable in discovering the \u201crhythms\u201d,\n\u201cpatterns\u201d, \u201claws\u201d or \u201ctrends\u201d\nthat underlie the evolution of history. (1957 [1964: 2\u20134, 39,\n128\u201330])\n\nPopper\u2019s title alludes to Marx\u2019s The Poverty of Philosophy\n(1847), which, in turn, responded to Proudhon\u2019s The Philosophy of\nPoverty (1847). Popper thereby signaled his intention to\nformulate a philosophico-methodological criticism of Marxist and, by\nextension, Hegelian philosophy of history. The term\n\u201chistoricism\u201dsignifies here both \u201chistorism\u201d\n(in the German sense of Historismus in connection with\nWindelband, Rickert, Dilthey, Meinecke\u2014by way of Herder and\nGoethe\u2014Mannheim and Troeltsch), and \u201chistoricism\u201d\n(in the Italian sense of Storicismo as formulated by\nBenedetto Croce). In tracing the term to both Herder and Goethe,\nMeinecke perceived their emphasis on the \u201cconcrete\u201d, the\n\u201cunique\u201d and the \u201cindividual\u201d as constituting\nthe core of historicism. Through this emphasis, historicism,\nunderstood as an outlook on the world (Weltanschauung),\nemphasizes the historical quality of human existence; as an\ninterpretation of history and life, it concerns itself with concepts\nof individuality and with individual development. Historicism seeks to\ndescribe and interpret the unsystematic variety of the reality of\nsociety and history, for the concept of individuality not only\nembraces individual persons but also includes the variety of\nhistorical forms, such as different peoples, customs, cultures,\ninstitutions, nation-states and the like; and the concept of\ndevelopment includes the historical process\u2014at a particular time\nand place\u2014within which individuality manifests itself not by\nabstract, general laws or principles but by the living expressions of\nthe multiplicity of these unique historical forms. Individuality, the\n\u201cfact of change\u201d, and the historical process, the\nWeltanschauung of historicism, combine to formulate a sort of\nhistorical relativism. This signification of historical phenomena\nentails the sense in which historical knowledge and reality are\nexplained by Dilthey:\n\n\nThe historical consciousness of the finitude of every historical\nphenomenon, every human or social state, of the relativity of every\nsort of belief, is the last step toward the liberation of man. With\nit, man attains the sovereign power to wring from every experience its\ncontent, to surrender wholly to it without prepossession\u2026.\nEvery beauty, every sanctity, every sacrifice, re-lived and expounded,\nopens up perspectives which disclose a reality\u2026. And, in\ncontrast with the relativity, the continuity of the creative force\nmakes itself feel as the central historical fact. (quoted in Hodges\n1944: 33\u201334).\n\n\nThe historicist orientation of Croce contributed to Ortega\u2019s shift\nfrom the historicization of life to the historicization of philosophy.\nOrtega\u2019s aspirations concerning the interpenetration of history and\nphilosophy were conveyed in his 1929 lectures:\n\n\nI hope, for very concrete reasons, that in our age the curiosity for\nthe eternal and invariable which is philosophy and the curiosity for\nthe inconstant and changeable which is history, for the first time\njoin each other and embrace. (Obras, VII: 285)\n\n\nOrtega\u2019s view that \u201chistorical thinking proceeds with respect to\nhuman phenomena\u201d, which combined with his notion of the vital\ndimensions of \u201chistorical reason\u201d, reveals some of the\naffinities in their historical thought. Croce and Ortega both viewed\nhuman life as embodying an essentially historical process within which\nthe realm of human reality is perceived and understood. Historical\nknowledge is found in the flow of the historical process, and\nknowledge of this very process provides an essential understanding of\nhuman reality. Where history, for Croce, consists in the\n\u201cinseparable synthesis of individual and universal\u201d,\nhistory, for Ortega, embodies the \u201cinexorable chain\u201d of\nhuman experiences and is constituted by the synthetic function of\n\u201chistorical reason\u201d. In this connection, both historicist\nand rationalist elements of coherence, for Ortega, were\nemphasized in his formulation of historicism. Traversing\nfrom philosophy to history and then back again to philosophy, Croce\npresented his systematic \u201cPhilosophy of the Spirit\u201d as\nabsolute historicism. He formulated his systematic treatment of the\n\u201cPhilosophy of the Spirit\u201d in four volumes and devoted one\nvolume of this general position to historical thought (Croce 1917\n[1920: 60\u201361]). History, in this connection, provides the\nimportant function of synthesizing the theoretical and practical\nlevels of human activity, the universal and the particular, as well as\nthought and action. From the point of view of these levels of human\nactivity, historical knowledge provides information about what\nactually happened on particular occasions at a particular place and\nunder a clearly specified period of time. History encompasses not only\nconcrete individual developments and concepts of individuality, but\nalso encompasses the \u201cuniversal\u201d. For Croce, individuality\nconstitutes the historical process within which an advance towards the\nuniversal occurs and, in this context, the general is identified with\nwhat the individual experiences directly. The historical process\nbecomes the expression of the \u201cinseparable synthesis of\nindividual and universal\u201d and, as such, establishes for Croce\nthe \u201cidentity of philosophy with history\u201d. Croce viewed\nany philosophical problem identical to historical synthetic judgments\nwhen restored to the historical context that gave rise to the question\nwe attempt to answer. As the synthesis of the individual and the\nuniversal, history possesses the most complete form of knowledge.\nIndeed, for Croce, as well as for Collingwood-- the philosopher\nwith whom Croce\u2019s name often has been\nassociated-- \u201chistory is thought\u201d (Collingwood 1948\n[1956: 215,245, 247\u201348]). From the theoretical perspective, thought\nestablishes connections between sensory-perception, intuition, and\nconcepts, whereas history synthesizes the aesthetic, logical and\npractical levels of human activity. Theoretic activity consists of\nknowledge while practical activity is characterized by volition, and\nthereby within this perspective knowledge is the precondition of\naction (Croce 1917 [1920: 60\u201361; 94\u2013107]; 1909 [1913:\n33]).\n",
