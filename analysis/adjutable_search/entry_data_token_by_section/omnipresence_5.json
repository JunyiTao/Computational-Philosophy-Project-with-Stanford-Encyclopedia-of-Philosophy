    "main_text": "Some Recent Alternative Proposals\n6. Future Directions\n\nIn a recent paper, Sam Cowling and Wesley D. Cray note that \u201c[t]he\nphilosophical literature on omnipresence is vast, though largely\nsituated in the context of Western, monotheistic philosophy of\nreligion\u201d (2017, p. 223). Their own proposal for expanding the\nfield is to develop an account of omnipresence according to which even\nnumbers and pure sets are omnipresent. That will likely strike\nmany as implausible, but their claim about the limited scope of\ntraditional work on the topic is accurate. In fact they could\nhave mentioned, more precisely, that the philosophers considered in\nthis entry tend to restrict their attention primarily to\nAugustine, Anselm, and Aquinas, with perhaps an aside to Peter\nLombard. That suggests that one avenue for future research is to\nconsider the work of ancient philosophers as well as early modern and\nlater philosophers. The mention of monotheistic philosophy of\nreligion calls attention to another often overlooked area, namely, the\nwork of Jewish and Islamic philosophers of religion. Finally,\nrecent interest in global philosophy suggests yet other areas into\nwhich work on omnipresence could extend.\n",
