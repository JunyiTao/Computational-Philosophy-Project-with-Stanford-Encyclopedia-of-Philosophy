    "main_text": "Truth Conditions Revisited || Nearest Possible Worlds\n4.1 Nearest Possible Worlds\n\nAdams\u2019s theory of validity emerged in the mid-1960s.\n\u201cNearest possible worlds\u201d theories were not yet in\nevidence. Nor was Lewis\u2019s result that conditional probabilities\nare not probabilities of the truth of a proposition. (Adams expressed\nscepticism about truth conditions for conditionals, but the question\nwas still open.) Stalnaker\u2019s (1968) semantics for conditionals\nwas an attempt to provide truth conditions which were compatible with\nRamsey\u2019s and Adams\u2019s thesis about conditional belief. (See\nalso Stalnaker (1970), where the probabilistic aspects of his proposal\nare developed.) That is, he sought truth conditions for a proposition\n\\(A\\gt B\\) (his notation) such that \\(\\mathbf{p}(A\\gt B)\\) must equal\n\\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\): \n\nNow that we have found an answer to the question, \u201cHow do we\ndecide whether or not we believe a conditional statement?\u201d\n[Ramsey\u2019s and Adams\u2019s answer] the problem is to make the\ntransition from belief conditions to truth conditions; \u2026 . The\nconcept of a possible world is just what we need to make the\ntransition, since a possible world is the ontological analogue of a\nstock of hypothetical beliefs. The following \u2026 is a first\napproximation to the account I shall propose: Consider a possible\nworld in which \\(A\\) is true and otherwise differs minimally from the\nactual world. \u201cIf \\(A\\), then \\(B\\)\u201d is true (false)\njust in case \\(B\\) is true (false) in that possible world. (1968,\npp. 33\u20134)\n\n\nIf an argument is necessarily truth-preserving, the improbability of\nits conclusion cannot exceed the sum of the improbabilities of the\npremises. The latter was the criterion Adams used in constructing his\nlogic. So Stalnaker\u2019s logic for conditionals must agree with\nAdams\u2019s over their common domain. And it does. The argument\nforms we showed to be invalid in Adams\u2019s logic (\u00a73.2) are\ninvalid on Stalnaker\u2019s semantics. For instance, the following is\npossible: in the nearest possible world in which you strike the match,\nit lights; in the nearest world in which you dip the match in water\nand strike it, it doesn\u2019t light. So Strengthening fails. (By\n\u201cnearest world in which \u2026\u201d I mean the possible\nworld which is minimally different from the actual world in which\n\u2026 .) \n\nConditional Proof fails for Stalnaker\u2019s semantics. \u201c\\(A\\)\nor \\(B\\); \\({\\sim}A\\); so \\(B\\)\u201d is of course valid. But (*)\n\u201c\\(A\\) or \\(B\\), therefore \\({\\sim}A\\gt B\\)\u201d is not: it\ncan be true that Ann or Mary cooked the dinner (for Ann cooked it);\nyet false that in the nearest world to the actual world in which Ann\ndid not cook it, Mary cooked it.\n\nStalnaker (1975) argued that although (*) is invalid, it is\nnevertheless a \u201creasonable inference\u201d when \u201c\\(A\\) or\n\\(B\\)\u201d is assertable, that is, in a context in which \\({\\sim}A\n\\amp{\\sim}B\\) has been ruled out but \\({\\sim}A \\amp B\\) and \\(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B\\) remain open possibilities.\n\nStalnaker\u2019s semantics uses a \u201cselection function\u201d,\nF, which selects, for any proposition \\(A\\) and any world \\(w\\), a\nworld, \\(w'\\), the nearest (most similar) world to \\(w\\) at which\n\\(A\\) is true. \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d is true at \\(w\\) iff \\(B\\) is\ntrue at F\\((A, w)\\), i.e. at \\(w'\\). \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d is true\nsimpliciter iff \\(B\\) is true at the nearest \\(A\\)-world to the actual\nworld. (However, we do not know which world is the actual\nworld\u2014there are many candidates compatible with our knowledge.\nTo be sure that if \\(A, B\\), we need to be sure that whichever world\n\\(w\\) is a candidate for actuality, \\(B\\) is true at the nearest\n\\(A\\)-world to \\(w\\).) If \\(A\\) is true, the nearest \\(A\\)-world to\nthe actual world is the actual world itself, so in this case \u201cIf\n\\(A, B\\)\u201d is true iff \\(B\\) is also true. The selection function\ndoes substantive work only when \\(A\\) is false.\n\nStalnaker\u2019s theory is intended to apply to counterfactuals and\nindicative conditionals alike, but in the case of indicative\nconditionals, he claims, the selection function is subject to a\npragmatic constraint, set in the framework of the dynamics of\nconversation. At any stage in a conversation, many things are taken\nfor granted by speaker and hearer, i.e. many possibilities are taken\nas already ruled out. The remaining possibilities are live. He calls\nthe set of worlds which are not ruled out \u2014 the live\npossibilities \u2014 the context set. For indicative conditionals,\nantecedents are typically live possibilities, and we focus on that\ncase. The pragmatic constraint for indicative conditionals says that\nif the antecedent \\(A\\) is compatible with the context set (i.e. true\nat some worlds in the context set) then for any world \\(w\\) in the\ncontext set, the nearest \\(A\\)-world to \\(w\\) \u2014 i.e. the world\npicked out by the selection function \u2014 is also a member of the\ncontext set. Roughly, if \\(A\\) is a live possibility (i.e. not already\nruled out), then for any world \\(w\\) which is a live possibility, the\nnearest \\(A\\)-world to \\(w\\) is also a live possibility. Or: things\nwhich are taken to be epistemically possible count as closer to\nactuality than things which are not.\n\nThe proposition expressed by \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d is the set of\nworlds \\(w\\) such that the nearest \\(A\\)-world to \\(w\\) is a\n\\(B\\)-world. The ordering of worlds, by the pragmatic constraint,\ndepends on the conversational setting. As different possibilities are\nlive in different conversational settings, a different proposition may\nbe expressed by \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d in different conversational\nsettings. Thus, the truth-conditions of conditionals are\ncontext-dependent, depending on which possibilities the speaker and\nhearer have ruled out.\n\nLet us transpose this to the one-person case: I am talking to myself,\ni.e. thinking \u2014 considering whether if \\(A, B\\). The context set\nis the set of worlds compatible with what I take for granted, i.e. the\nset of worlds not ruled out, i.e. the set of worlds which are\nepistemically possible for me. Let \\(A\\) be epistemically possible for\nme. Then the pragmatic constraint requires that for any world in the\ncontext set, the nearest \\(A\\)-world to it is also in the context set.\nProvided you and I have different bodies of information, the\nproposition I am considering when I consider whether if \\(A, B\\) may\nwell differ from the proposition you would express in the same words:\nthe constraints on nearness differ; worlds which are near for me may\nnot be near for you.\n\nThis enables Stalnaker to avoid the argument against\nnon-truth-functional truth conditions given in \u00a72.2. The argument\nwas as follows. There are six incompatible logically possible\ncombinations of truth values for \\(A, B\\) and \\({\\sim}A\\gt B\\). We\nstart off with no firm beliefs about which obtains. Now we eliminate\njust \\({\\sim}A \\amp{\\sim}B\\), i.e. establish \\(A\\) or \\(B\\). That\nleaves five remaining possibilities, including two in which\n\u201c\\({\\sim}A\\gt B\\)\u201d is false. So we can\u2019t be certain\nthat \\({\\sim}A\\gt B\\) (whereas, intuitively, one can be certain of the\nconditional in these circumstances). Stalnaker replies: we\ncan\u2019t, indeed, be certain that the proposition we were wondering\nabout earlier is true. But we are now in a new context: \\({\\sim}A\n\\amp{\\sim}B\\)-worlds have been ruled out (but \\({\\sim}A \\amp\nB\\)-worlds remain). We now express a different proposition by\n\u201c\\({\\sim}A\\gt B\\)\u201d, with different truth conditions,\ngoverned by a new nearness relation. As all our live\n\\({\\sim}A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds (none are \\({\\sim}B\\)-worlds), we\nknow that the new proposition is true.\n\nThis sensitivity of the proposition expressed by \u201cIf \\(A,\nB\\)\u201d to what is taken for granted by speaker and hearer, or to\nthe epistemic state of the thinker, is somewhat unnatural. One usually\ndistinguishes between the content of what is said and the different\nepistemic attitudes one may take to that same content. Someone\nconjectures that if Ann isn\u2019t home, Bob is. We are entirely\nagnostic about this. Then we discover that at least one of them is at\nhome (nothing stronger). We now accept the conditional. It seems more\nnatural to say that we now have a different attitude to the same\nconditional thought, that \\(B\\) on the supposition that \\({\\sim}A\\).\nIt does not seem that the content of our conditional thought has\nchanged. And if there are conditional propositions, it seems more\nnatural to say that we now take to be true what we were previously\nwondering about. There does not seem to be independent motivation for\nthinking the content of the proposition has changed.\n\nAlso, Stalnaker\u2019s argument is restricted to the special case\nwhere we take the \\({\\sim}A \\amp{\\sim}B\\)-possibilities to be ruled\nout. Consider a case when, starting out agnostic, we become close to\ncertain, but not quite certain, that \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) \u2014 say we\nbecome about 95% certain that \\(A\\) or \\(B\\), and are about 50%\ncertain that \\(A\\). According to Supp, we are entitled to be quite\nclose to certain that if \\({\\sim}A, B\\) \u2014 90% certain in fact.\n(If \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\text{ or } B) = 95\\)% and \\(\\mathbf{p}(A) = 50\\)%,\nthen \\(\\mathbf{p}({\\sim}A \\amp B) = 45\\)%. Now \\(\\mathbf{p}({\\sim}A\n\\amp{\\sim}B) = 5\\)%. So, on the assumption that \\({\\sim}A\\),\nit\u2019s 45:5, or 9:1, that \\(B\\).) In this case, no additional\npossibilities have been ruled out. There are \\({\\sim}A\n\\amp{\\sim}B\\)-worlds as well as \\({\\sim}A \\amp B\\)-worlds which are\npermissible candidates for being nearest. Stalnaker has not told us\nwhy we should think it likely, in this case, that the nearest\n\\({\\sim}A\\)-world is a \\(B\\)-world.\n\nUncertain conditional judgements create difficulties for all\npropositional theories. As we have seen, it is easy to construct\nprobabilistic counterexamples to Hook\u2019s theory; and it is easy\nto do so for the variant of Stalnaker\u2019s theory according to\nwhich \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d is true iff \\(B\\) is true at\nall nearest \\(A\\)-worlds (as Lewis (1973) holds for\ncounterfactuals). (It is very close to certain that if you toss the\ncoin ten times, you will get at least one head; but it is certainly\nfalse that the consequent is true at all nearest\nantecedent-worlds.) It is rather harder for Stalnaker\u2019s theory,\nbecause nearness is so volatile, and also because it is not fully\nspecified. But here is a putative counterexample: the short straws.\n(An example of this type I learned from James Studd.)\n\nYou are to pick a straw from a collection of 100 straws. From the\nangle you see them\u2014end on\u2014they all look the same; and they\nare the same, except for length. 90 are of length 10\u00a0cm, 1 is\n11\u00a0cm, and 9 are 20\u00a0cm. Consider this conditional, about the\nstraw that will be picked:\n\n(*) If it\u2019s over 10\u00a0cm, it\u2019s less than 15\u00a0cm.\n\n\nIntuitively, (*) is 10% likely: of those over 10\u00a0cm, one is under\n15\u00a0cm and nine are not. But on Stalnaker\u2019s theory, (*)\nappears to be 91% likely: it\u2019s 90% likely that it is not over\n10\u00a0cm, in which case, in the world most similar to the actual\nworld in which it is over 10\u00a0cm, it is 11\u00a0cm, i.e. less than\n15\u00a0cm. And we add another 1% for the case in which it is\n11\u00a0cm, hence under 15\u00a0cm.\n\n(The point is simpler for the counterfactual: \u201cIf it had been\nover 10\u00a0cm, it would have been less than 15\u00a0cm\u201d:\njudging by similarity to the actual world, this seems true; but\nintuitively it is only 10% likely.)\n\nThe example casts doubt on whether any notion of similarity, or\nminimal difference from the actual world, is the right notion for\nunderstanding conditionals, as opposed to taking a probability\ndistribution over the various possible antecedent worlds.\n\nThere is also the question, for Stalnaker, of the uniqueness\nassumption\u2014that there is a unique closest antecedent-world.\nStalnaker (1981, pp. 87\u201391) discusses this, and proposes to use\nthe machinery of supervaluations when there is no unique nearest\nworld: the conditional is true iff true whichever of the candidates\nfor nearest the selection function selects, false iff false for all\nsuch selections, otherwise it is indeterminate\u2014neither true nor\nfalse. As the uniqueness assumption often fails, a great many\nconditionals will just get the verdict indeterminate. For instance, I\nam considering whether, (*) if I pick a red ball, it will have a black\nspot. 90% of the red balls have black spots. Merely to be told that\n(*) is indeterminate, is less helpful than being told it is 90%\nlikely.\n\nDoes making the proposition expressed by the conditional\ncontext-dependent escape Lewis\u2019s result that a conditional\nprobability is not the probability of the truth of any proposition?\nLewis showed that there is no proposition \\(A*B\\) such that in every\nbelief state \\(\\mathbf{p}(A*B) = \\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\). He did not rule\nout that in every belief state there is some proposition or other,\n\\(A*B\\), such that \\(\\mathbf{p}(A*B) = \\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\). However, in\nthe wake of Lewis, Stalnaker himself proved a stronger result, for his\nconditional connective: the equation \\(\\mathbf{p}(A\\gt B) =\n\\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\) cannot hold for all propositions \\(A, B\\) in a\nsingle belief state. If it holds for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we can find two\nother propositions, \\(C\\) and D (truth-functional compounds of \\(A,\nB\\) and \\(A\\gt B)\\) for which, demonstrably, it does not hold. (See\nStalnaker\u2019s letter to van Fraassen published in van Fraassen\n(1976, pp. 303\u20134), Gibbard (1981, pp. 219\u201320), and\nEdgington (1995, pp. 276\u20138).\n\nIt was Gibbard (1981, pp. 231\u20134) who showed just how sensitive\nto epistemic situations Stalnaker\u2019s truth conditions would be.\nLater (1984, ch. 6), reacting to Gibbard, Stalnaker seemed more\nambivalent about whether conditional judgements express propositions.\nBut he still takes his original theory to be a serious candidate\n(Stalnaker 2005, 2019), and this remains an influential theory. His\nwork has inspired others to develop related theories:\ncontext-dependent theories are currently popular (see below,\n\u00a74.3); the fact that Stalnaker kept the probabilistic\nconsiderations aside in his 1968 paper led others to develop the\nRamsey test for all-or-nothing beliefs\u2014see e.g. G\u00e4rdenfors\n(1986); and another close relative of Stalnaker\u2019s semantics, due\nto Richard Bradley (2012), is discussed below in \u00a75.\n",
