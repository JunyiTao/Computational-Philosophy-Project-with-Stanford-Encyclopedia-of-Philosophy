Though non-cognitivists may\ndeny that the truth values of moral judgments are relative to speakers\nor agents and their attitudes, non-cognitivists do accept a\nconstitutive connection between a speaker\u2019s attitudes and their\nmoral judgements. Specifically, non-cognitivists hold that it is\nsemantically appropriate for a person to utter a moral judgment\nwhenever she wishes to express the relevant non-cognitive attitude.\nThis has led some to suggest that noncognitivists must agree with old\nfashioned subjectivists about the truth conditions for moral\nutterances. (Jackson and Pettit 1998; Suikkanen 2009; Peacocke 2004)\nMany noncognitivists in fact believe that there are few rational\nconstraints on holding the relevant attitudes. And then it is hard to\nsee how consistent moral judgments can be mistaken (Carnap 1937, 30;\nHare 1963, 110). Thus if relativism is problematic, it may seem that\nnon-cognitivism inherits the problems. Still, it is worth noting that\narguments to this effect import extra premises that noncognitivists do\nnot and need not accept. Semantic appropriateness need not (and should\nnot if expressivists are right) be construed as truth. Expressivists\nthink that it is semantically appropriate to use a moral sentence when\none has the attitude that it expresses. This commitment is parallel to\nthe claim that it is semantically appropriate to use \u201cGrass is\ngreen\u201d when one believes that grass is green. (Schroeder 2014,\nsee also Barker 2000 and Dreier 2004a) That a cognitivist should agree\nthat this use is appropriate does not commit cognitivists to the claim\nthat the truth of \u201cGrass is green\u201d turns on one\u2019s\nbeliefs.\n\nNon-cognitivists claim that whether or not a moral judgment is\nmistaken is itself a matter for moral theorizing. A speaker should\nonly call a moral judgment true if he or she accepts that judgment. A\nspeaker who expresses his or her acceptance of relativism in the\nnormal way might say something such as \u201cThey\u2019re both\nsaying something true\u201d. This might seem to be expressing\ncommitment to a very deferential moral theory \u2013 one according to\nwhich each agent should just do what she believes is right. The\nnon-cognitivists who adopt this response argue that this natural\ninterpretation of such claims is correct. What may seem to be a higher\nlevel metaethical claim \u2013 that no consistent set of moral\njudgments is mistaken \u2013 , is really just another moral judgment\nand hence one which would be rejected by any moral judge with\nsubstantive moral commitments (Blackburn 1998, 296 & 304; Timmons\n1999; Horgan and Timmons 2006c). If this line of argument works it\nwill allow non-cognitivism to gain the allegiance of those who wish to\ndeny relativism while giving the motivations that lead to both it and\nnon-cognitivism their due.\n",
