    "main_text": "Some Applications || Logics of Fiction\n5.4 Logics of Fiction\n\nBecause fictions use names that do not refer to literally existing\nthings, free logic has sometimes been employed in their analysis. So\nlong as we engage in the pretense of a story, however, there is no\nspecial need for it. It is true, for example, in Tolkien\u2019s\nThe Lord of the Rings that Gollum hates the sun, from which\nwe can legitimately infer that in the story there exists\nsomething that hates the sun. Thus quantifiers may behave classically\nso long as we consider only what occurs and what exists \u201cin the\nstory.\u201d (The general logic of fiction, however, is often\nregarded as nonclassical, for two reasons: (1) a story may be\ninconsistent and hence require a\n paraconsistent logic,\n and (2) the objects a story describes are typically (maybe always)\nincomplete; that is, the story does not determine for each such object\n\\(o\\) and every property \\(P\\) whether or not \\(o\\) has \\(P\\).)\n\nThe picture changes, however, when we distinguish what is true in the\nstory from what is literally true. For this purpose logics of fiction\noften deploy a sentence operator that may be read \u201cin the\nstory.\u201d Here we shall use \u2018\\(\\mathbf{S}_x\\)\u2019 to mean\n\u201cin the story \\(x\\),\u201d where \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 is to be\nreplaced by the name of a specific story. Anything within the scope of\nthis operator is asserted to be true in the named story; what is\noutside its scope is to be understood literally. (For a summary of\ntheories of what it means to be true in a story, see Woods 2006.)\n\nWith this operator the statement \u2018In the story, The Lord of\nthe Rings, Gollum hates the sun\u2019 may be formalized as\nfollows: \n\n\\[\\tag{GHS} \\mathbf{S}_{The\\: Lord\\: of\\: the\\: Rings}(\\text{Gollum\nhates the sun}). \\]\n\n\nThe statement that in The Lord of the Rings something hates\nthe sun is: \n\n\\[ \\mathbf{S}_{The\\: Lord\\: of\\: the\\: Rings}\\exists x(x \\text{ hates\nthe sun}). \\]\n\n\nThis second statement follows from the first, even though Gollum does\nnot literally exist. But it does not follow that there exists\nsomething such that it, in The Lord of the Rings, hates the\nsun: \n\n\\[ \\exists x \\mathbf{S}_{The\\: Lord\\: of\\: the\\: Rings}(x \\text{ hates\nthe sun}). \\]\n\n\nand indeed that statement is not true, for, literally, Gollum does not\nexist. Since the sun, however, exists both literally and in the story,\nthe statement: \n\n\\[ \\exists x\\mathbf{S}_{The\\: Lord\\: of\\: the\\: Rings}(\\text{Gollum\nhates } x) \\]\n\n\nis true and follows by free existential generalization from (GHS)\ntogether with the true premise \u2018\\(\\rE!(\\text{the sun})\\)\u2019.\nThus free logic may play a role in reasoning that mixes fictional and\nliteral discourse.\n\nTerms for fictional entities also occur in statements that are\nentirely literal, making no mention of what is true \u201cin the\nstory.\u201d Consider, for example, the statement: \n\n\\[\\tag{G} \\text{Gollum is more famous than G\u00f6del.} \\]\n\n\nMark Sainsbury (2005, ch. 6) holds that reference failure invariably\nmakes such statements false and hence that they are best represented\nin a negative free logic. Others, however\u2014including Orlando 2008\nand Dumitru and Kroon 2008\u2014question Sainsbury\u2019s treatment,\nmaintaining that statements like (G) are both atomic and true. If so,\nthey require a positive free logic. The logic must be free because it\ndeals with an empty singular term, and it must be positive, because\nonly on a positive semantics can empty-termed atomic statements be\ntrue. One must still decide, however, whether the name\n\u2018Gollum\u2019 is to be understood as having no referent or as\nhaving a referent that does not exist.\n\nIf \u2018Gollum\u2019 has no referent, then (G) might be handled by\na single-domain positive semantics. But that semantics would\nhave to treat atomic formulas non-standardly; it could not, as usual,\nstipulate that (G) is true just in case the pair \\(\\langle\\)Gollum,\nG\u00f6del\\(\\rangle\\) is a member of the extension of the predicate\n\u2018is more famous than\u2019; for if there is no Gollum, there is\nno such pair. On such a semantics \u2018Gollum is more famous than\nG\u00f6del\u2019 would not imply that something is more famous than\nG\u00f6del.\n\nIf, on the other hand, terms such as \u2018Gollum\u2019 refer to\nnon-existent objects, then those objects could inhabit the outer\ndomain of a dual-domain positive free logic. Dumitru (2015), for\nexample, lays out such a dual-domain semantics for fictional discourse\nusing free descriptions and compares it with a supervaluational\napproach that also uses free descriptions. In a such a dual-domain\nsemantics, atomic formulas have their standard truth conditions: (G)\nis true just in case \\(\\langle\\)Gollum, G\u00f6del\\(\\rangle\\) is a\nmember of the extension of \u2018is more famous than\u2019.\nMoreover, if we allow quantifiers over that outer domain, then\n\u2018Something is more famous than G\u00f6del\u2019 (where the\nquantifier ranges over the outer domain) does follow from\n\u2018Gollum is more famous than G\u00f6del\u2019, though\n\u2018There literally exists something more famous than\nG\u00f6del\u2019 (where the quantifier ranges over the inner domain)\ndoes not. Meinongian logics of fiction employ this strategy.\n",
