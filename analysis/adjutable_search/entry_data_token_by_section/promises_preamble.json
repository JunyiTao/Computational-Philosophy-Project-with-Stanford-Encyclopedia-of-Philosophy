    "main_text": "\n\nFew moral judgments are more intuitively obvious and more widely\nshared than that promises ought to be kept. It is in part this fixed\nplace in our intuitive judgments that makes promises of particular\ninterest to philosophers, as well as a host of social scientists and\nother theorists.\n\nAnother feature of promises that make them a topic of philosophical\nconcern is their role in producing trust, and by so doing facilitating\nsocial coordination and cooperation. Because of this promises and\nrelated phenomena, such as vows, oaths, pledges, contracts, treaties\nand agreements more generally are important elements of justice and\nthe law, and, at least in the Social Contract tradition, of the\npolitical order as well.\n\nPromises are of special interest to ethical theorists, as they are\ngenerally taken to impose moral obligations. Thus an explanation of\nhow such promissory obligations come about and how they function is\nnecessary for a complete moral theory.\n\nAnd if indeed promises produce moral obligations, they are of a\npeculiar sort. Unlike paradigmatic moral duties, the duty not to harm\nfor example, promissory obligations are not owed equally to everyone,\nbut rather only those we have promised. Further, promissory\nobligations are voluntary; we don\u2019t have to make promises, but\nwe must keep them when we do.\n\nAnd promissory obligations aren\u2019t just contingent upon acts of\nthe will, like the obligations we might incur by deliberately damaging\nsomeone\u2019s property, but (at least it seems on first reflection)\nthey are immediately created by acts of the will. When I\npromise to do something, it seems that by so doing I have\ncreated the obligation to do it.\n\nThis last feature makes promissory obligations a special puzzle for\nethical theories. The idea that we simply manufacture promissory\nobligations by speaking them, like an incantation, is decidedly\nmysterious. As Hume acidly remarked in the Treatise\n(1739\u201340):\n\n\nI shall further observe, that, since every new promise imposes a new\nobligation of morality on the person who promises, and since this new\nobligation arises from his will; it is one of the most mysterious and\nincomprehensible operations that can possibly be imagined, and may\neven be compared to transubstantiation or holy\norders, where a certain form of words, along with a certain\nintention, changes entirely the nature of an external object, and even\nof a human creature. (Treatise, 3.2.5; emphasis in the\noriginal)\n\n\nThe philosophical work on these topics is body of literature that\nspans the ages. Although promising as a phenomenon is rarely the sole\nsubject of a major work, it is a subject treated by many major\nfigures. From the ancients to the medievals to the moderns and beyond,\ntheorists have sought to explain the normative force of promises.\nWhile the bulk of the corpus is in ethical and political theory and\nthe related fields of legal theory and applied ethics, work on\npromises has also been done in the philosophy of language, action\ntheory, rationality theory, game theory and other areas.\n\nThere are a variety of methods of classifying promissory theories in\nthe literature. Atiyah (1981), Downie (1985), Vitek (1993), Shiffrin\n(2008), Owens (2012), van Roojen (2013), Liberto (2016b), and many\nothers have given the matter some attention, and while there is\nsignificant overlap, there are some differences as well. Typically\ntheorists sort theories by reference to the way in which promissory\nobligations are generated. On this standard taxonomy the main types of\npromissory theory are: Normative power views, Conventionalist views,\nExpectation views, and Joint Commitment views\n",
