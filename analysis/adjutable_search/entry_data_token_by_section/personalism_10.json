    "main_text": "Characteristics of personalist thought || Self-determination\n6.5 Relationality and communion\n\n\nPersonalists stress the person\u2019s nature as a social being. According\nto personalists, the person never exists in isolation, and moreover\npersons find their human perfection only in communion with other\npersons. Interpersonal relations are never superfluous\nor optional to the person, but are indicated by his nature and an essential component of his fulfillment.\n\n\nRelation is proper only to the person. Personalism has endeavored to\nhighlight this aspect of personhood and bring it to the fore. It is\ncentral to personalism\u2019s reaction against and endeavor to overcome the\npolarization of individualism on the one hand and collectivism on the\nother. Personalists consider human beings as a \u201cbeings for\nothers\u201d or \u201cbeings with\nothers.\u201d Relationship is not an optional accessory for the human\nperson, but is essential to his personhood. He is a\nbeing-for-relation.\n\n\nPersonalists recognize that as much as he may strive for independence,\nthe human person necessarily relies on others. He depends on other\npersons for his survival and development, and this interdependence is\na hallmark of human existence. Beyond this, the human person also\ntends toward society as a basic human value. Such society is not only\na matter of utility or convenience but reflects an innate tendency of\nthe person to seek out his fellows and enter into spiritual\nassociation with them.  The trait of sociableness has been observed\nsince the earliest philosophers, and reflects both man\u2019s dependence on\nother people for his subsistence and development and his natural tendency to\ndeeper communion.\n\n\nSome personalists note that man\u2019s social nature and his vocation\nto inter-personal communion are not the same thing. Their capacity for\nrational community and friendship is one of the things that make human\nbeings social. But the person\u2019s capacity for communion is\naccording to these personalists deeper than mere\nsociability. \u201cSociety,\u201d in fact, is sometimes analogously\napplied to non-personal beings that live and interact as a group\nrather than in isolation from one another, whereas the word\n\u2018communion\u2019 could never be understood in this way.\nCommunio does not simply refer to something common, but rather\nto a mode of being and acting in common through which the persons\ninvolved mutually confirm and affirm one another, a mode of being and\nacting that promotes the personal fulfillment of each of them by virtue\nof their mutual relationship. This mode of being and acting is an\nexclusive property of persons.\n\n\nPersonalists see the human person\u2019s vocation to communion as rooted in\nrational nature, through the person\u2019s subjectivity and\nself-determination.  Far from closing the person in on himself, these\ncharacteristics of the person\u2019s spiritual nature dispose him to\ncommunication with other persons. For most personalists, the\nsubjectivity of the person has nothing in common with the isolated\nunity of the Leibnizian monad but requires the communication of\nknowledge and love.\n\n\nThis communication, in turn, depends on the person\u2019s\nself-determination with its distinctive structure of self-possession\nand self-governance. As a free, willing subject, the person cannot be\npossessed by another, unless he chooses to make a gift of himself to\nanother. Personalists assert that the person belongs to himself in a\nway that no other thing or animal can. Self-possession does not imply\nisolation. On the contrary, both self-possession and self-governance\nimply a special disposition to make \u201ca gift of oneself.\u201d\nOnly if one possesses oneself can one give oneself and do this in a\ndisinterested way. And only if one governs oneself can one make a\ndisinterested gift of oneself. This vocation to self-giving is so\nessential to the constitution of the person that it is precisely when\none becomes a gift for others that one most fully becomes\noneself. Without a disinterested gift of self man cannot achieve the\nfinality that is proper to a human being by virtue of his being a\nperson, and cannot fully discover his true self.\n\n\nFor personalists, this \u201claw of the gift\u201d shows that the\nrelation and the society of which the person alone is capable, and\nwhich are necessary for his realization as a person, consist not only\nin association, but in love. They consist in a love which gives and\ngives itself, which receives not only things but other persons as\nwell. Only persons can give love and only persons can receive\nlove.\n",
