    "main_text": "Ethics and Political Philosophy || Christian Ethics as Recognition of Absolute Life\n4.4 Political Philosophy\n\nHenry\u2019s critique of contemporary culture also raises the\nquestion of social conditions and their impact on the exercise of\nsubjective potentialities (see also G\u00e9ly 2007). The issue of\nsocial organization refers here to two important fields of\ninvestigation: economics, investigated in Marx (1976), and\npolitics, investigated mainly in From Communism to Capitalism.\nTheory of a Catastrophe (1990) as well as in two important\narticles: \u201cLa vie et la r\u00e9publique\u201d (\u201cLife\nand the Republic\u201d, 1989) and \u201cDifficile\nd\u00e9mocratie\u201d (\u201cDifficult Democracy\u201d, 2000).\nFor both economics and politics, Henry\u2019s normative critique\ntargets the forgetting and the occultation of life as a transcendental\ngenesis in which political organization and economy are rooted.\nPolitics and economics are both superstructures that are necessarily\ntied to representation and measurement, but their legitimacy comes\nfrom what is ante-political and ante-economic, namely transcendental\nlife. In Henry\u2019s view, modernity turns this actual genesis\nupside down: superstructures seem to have become autonomous and, in\nreverse, tend to impose their laws on immanent life. This reversal is\nonly possible insofar as the foundational character of life as\nimmanent appearing remains forgotten. As Henry argues in From\nCommunism to Capitalism, in techno-scientific capitalism, and\neven more in totalitarianism, the tendency toward an (albeit illusory)\nautonomization of superstructures becomes extreme. Despite the\nviolence of totalitarianism, and as can be seen from the analysis of\nHenry\u2019s concept of \u201cbarbarism\u201d, alienation can never\nbe total. It is nonetheless very real, precisely because it is able to\naffect individual praxis by substituting the \u201claws of\nideality\u201d for those of \u201cvital teleology\u201d (B 134).\nAnd again, it is the lack of recognition of immanent life as\nfundamental phenomenality that makes the reversal that characterizes\n\u201cbarbarism\u201d possible. While Henry distinguishes between an\noriginal ethics\u2014ethos itself as first ethics in which\nlife accomplishes its essence\u2014and ethics as normative and\ndiscursive (B 96\u20137), it is to the latter that the philosophical\ntask of reminding us of the transcendental genesis and, hence, of life\nas fundamental appearing is assigned. Thereby, the ethics of\naffectivity becomes political insofar as it identifies and unmasks\n\u201chypostases\u201d in economics and politics (VR 158).\nHenry\u2019s phenomenology can then conceptualize cultural\nrenaissance as a \u201creversal of the reversal\u201d operating in\nfigures of \u201cbarbarism\u201d. As far as the political realm is\nconcerned, however, such a renaissance faces the tension\u2014the\naporia even\u2014that must exist between invisible life as\nipseity and public affairs as general. This tension, which constitutes\nthe political, underlies the democratic project as the self-foundation\nof communal life (DD 171). From Henry\u2019s point of view, democracy\ndoes not necessarily promote culture: if democracy is a chance to\nreestablish \u201cthe true order of things, the foundation of the\npolitical in life, for which it can be nothing but a mediation\u201d,\n(VR 162) it also entails the risk that the visibility necessary to\npublic life be posited as the only possible mode of appearing.\nDemocracy may thereby favor the occultation of its own foundation and\nbecome the objective ally of the Galilean principle (DD 175).\nMoreover, the prospect of political self-foundation is, in its\nessence, at risk of reproducing the transcendental illusion of the ego\n(IAT 140) on the communal level: just like the ego is victim of an\nillusion when it presumes to be the ultimate source of the \u201cI\ncan\u201d, so is a political community misdirected if it presumes to\nbe the ultimate constitutive power of communal life. On this political\nlevel the religious bond with absolute life can also fall into\noblivion. In such a case, it is the conquest of human rights that is\neventually threatened by the reduction of the human to that which\nscientific exteriority is able to measure and enunciate. As\nHenry\u2019s phenomenology of intersubjectivity in Part III of\nMaterial Phenomenology explains, absolute life is shared by\nall living and provides the ground for an invisible and immanent\ncommunity. The core of Henry\u2019s political philosophy lies\ntherefore in the principle according to which the political is only\nlegitimate as a mediation for what is ante-political\u2014namely\nlife, both individual and communal.\n\nThe originality of Henry\u2019s contribution to phenomenology is\nwithout a doubt his thesis of the duality of appearing, where\n\u201cimmanent affectivity\u201d or \u201clife\u201d designates\nthe \u201cfirst\u201d and more fundamental form of appearing.\nHenry\u2019s approach can therefore be described as a systematic\nphenomenology and philosophy of life. It is also a philosophy of\nimmanence, but enriched with the heritage of transcendental\nphenomenology, since, for Henry, immanent affectivity is nothing less\nthan the condition of possibility of both the world and consciousness.\nFurthermore, this transcendental framework leads him to develop a\ncritique of the history of philosophy as well as an approach to\npractical philosophy and the philosophy of religion. As a philosophy\nof immanence, however, the formidable challenge Henry\u2019s\nphenomenology faces lies in its application to what it regards as\ntranscendent, namely that which is given to us through the distance of\nintentional consciousness: the world and even ourselves as intentional\nbeings.\n",
