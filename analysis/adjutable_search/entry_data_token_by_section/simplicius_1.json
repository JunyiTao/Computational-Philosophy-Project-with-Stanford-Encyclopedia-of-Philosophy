Simplicius as a Commentator: General Remarks\n\nIn his introduction to the Commentary on the Categories,\nSimplicius provides a neat characterisation of the good commentator\n(axion ex\u00eag\u00eat\u00ean) on Aristotle (and\nPlato):\n\n\nThe worthy exegete of Aristotle\u2019s writings must not fall wholly\nshort of the latter\u2019s greatness of intellect\n(megalonoia). He must also have experience of everything the\nPhilosopher has written, and must be an expert\n(epistem\u00f4n) of Aristotle\u2019s customary use of\nlanguage (sun\u00eatheia). His judgement must be impartial\n(adekaston), so that he may neither, out of misplaced zeal,\nseek to prove something well said to be unsatisfactory, nor, if some\npoint should require attention, should he obstinately persist in\ntrying to demonstrate that [Aristotle] is always and everywhere\ninfallible, as if he had enrolled himself in the Philosopher\u2019s\nschool. [The good exegete] must, I believe, not convict the\nphilosophers of discordance (diaph\u00f4nia) by looking only\nat the letter (lexis) of what [Aristotle] says against Plato;\nbut he must look towards the spirit (nous), and track down\n(anikhneuein) the harmony (sumph\u00f4nia) which\nreigns between them on the majority of points. (Simplicius, In\nCat. 7.23\u201332, translated by M. Chase, slightly\nmodified)\n\n\nThis is certainly one of the most interesting passages for those\ntrying to understand the Simplicius\u2019 view of the role of the\ncommentator. The passage can, with caution, be considered a kind of\nself-portrait of the Neoplatonic commentator at work, a glimpse into\nhis workshop, as it were. The good commentator must (1) be able to\nunderstand and follow Aristotle\u2019s arguments (\u201cgreatness of\nintellect\u201d). He must (2) have read all of Aristotle\u2019s\nworks and must know his terminology and ways of expressing himself\n(\u201ccustomary use of language\u201d). This is required in order\nto explain \u201cAristotle by means of Aristotle\u201d (see\n[Pseudo-?]Simplicius, In de Anima 1.14\u201315, and\nElias/David, In Cat. 123.7\u201311) and show that he does\nnot contradict himself. The good commentator must also (3) be\nimpartial, that is, not openly polemical against Aristotle and merely\nscoring points, but at the same time not an uncritical enthusiast.\nSimplicius illustrates this elsewhere with his well-known saying,\n\u201camicus Plato vel Aristoteles, sed magis amica\nveritas\u201d (\u201cPlato or Aristotle are dear to me, but\nmuch dearer is the truth\u201d; see Tar\u00e1n 1984 and In\nCael. 301.19\u201321 [about Alexander]). In other words, it is\ncertainly legitimate to criticise Aristotle. But things are different\nwith respect to Plato, because it seems that Simplicius never\ncriticised him. Finally, the good commentator must (4) strive for\nharmony in most cases, by means of a distinction between the\nsuperficial sense of a text (lexis) and its true or deeper\nmeaning (nous).\n\nIn order to forge a clearer profile of the commentator, it will be\nuseful to compare him to other Aristotelian commentators, such as\nAlexander of Aphrodisias, Iamblichus, David, and Elias. The\nNeoplatonists certainly did not consider Alexander to be an impartial\ncommentator on Aristotle. Rather, Simplicius often treats him as\nsomeone who stands in firm opposition to the harmony of Plato and\nAristotle. As good a text as any to characterise Alexander\u2019s\nattitude towards Aristotle can be found in the opening words of his\nDe anima:\n\n\nJust as I have great reverence for Aristotle\u2019s works on other\nsubjects, since I find more truth in the views passed down from him\nthan in what others have claimed, I regard what he states in his\ntheory of the soul in the same way as well. I will therefore have\nfulfilled my aim if I can set out his claims about the soul as clearly\nas possible and offer suitable arguments to show how each of them is\nwell formulated. (Alexander, De anima 2.4\u20139 [Bruns],\ntranslated by V. Caston)\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Neoplatonists viewed Iamblichus as someone who\nbrought Plato and Aristotle too close together. A text from Philoponus\npoints to interpreters who argued that the two even agreed on the\nnature of universals:\n\n\nThus, also Proclus plainly and openly agrees with us about the\ndifference of the two philosophers [sc. as regards the status of\nuniversals], or rather he has demonstrated it from the words/writings\nof Aristotle himself. From this one can only wonder about the\novershooting amount of shamelessness among those who try to show that\nAristotle and Plato did agree also in this point. (Philoponus, De\naeternitate mundi 32.8\u201313 [Rabe], trans. by author)\n\n\nIt is very likely that Iamblichus was among these interpreters. We\nknow from elsewhere that he even saw agreement regarding the theory of\nForms (Elias/David, In Cat. 123.1\u20133). Along the same\nlines, Simplicius seems to have reconciled Aristotle\u2019s\ncomparison of the soul with an empty writing tablet (De anima\nIII 4, 429b31\u2013430a2) and Plato\u2019s theory of innate\nknowledge (de Haas 2000, 169\u2013170).\n\nWas Simplicius impartial towards Plato? This is insisted upon, for\ninstance, by Elias/David (In Cat. 122.27\u201332), but not,\nat least not explicitly, by Simplicius. As noted above, Simplicius is\nprepared to criticise Aristotle time and again (for instance, in his\ndigression on place [topos]), but he never seems to criticise\nPlato. For Simplicius, Plato is the one who brought the truth to\nlight, the explainer or interpreter of the truth (ho t\u00eas\nal\u00eatheias ex\u00eag\u00eat\u00eas, In Cael.\n131.1), but Aristotle is never granted such an honorary title (cf.\nSyrianus\u2019 and Proclus\u2019 distinction between a \u201cdivine\nPlato\u201dand a (merely) \u201cdaimonic/semi-divine\nAristotle\u201d). Therefore, one may surmise that Plato was not\nsubject to the impartiality requirement, since he was, compared to all\nother representatives of the ancient philosophical tradition (hoi\npalaioi), somehow closest to the truth.\n",
