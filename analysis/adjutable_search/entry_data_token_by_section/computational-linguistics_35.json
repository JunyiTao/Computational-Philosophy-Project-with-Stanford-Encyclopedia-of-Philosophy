    "main_text": "Applications || Collaborative problem solvers and intelligent tutors\n10.9 Language-enabled robots\n\nAs noted at the beginning of \nsection 10, robots are beginning to be\nequipped with web services, question answering abilities, chatbot\ntechniques (for fall-back and entertainment), tutoring functions, and\nso on. The transfer of such technologies to robots has been slow,\nprimarily because of the very difficult challenges involved in just\nequipping a robot with the hardware and software needed for basic\nvisual perception, speech recognition, exploratory and goal-directed\nnavigation (in the case of mobile robots), and object manipulation.\nHowever, the keen public interest in intelligent robots and their\nenormous economic potential (for household help, eldercare, medicine,\neducation, entertainment, agriculture, industry, search and rescue,\nmilitary missions, space exploration, and so on) will surely continue\nto energize the drive towards greater robotic intelligence and\nlinguistic competence.\nA good sense of the state of the art and difficulties in human-robot\ndialogue can be gained from (Scheutz et\nal. 2011). Some of the dialogue\nexamples presented there, concerning boxes and blocks, are reminiscent\nof Winograd's shrdlu, but they also exhibit the\nchallenges involved in\nreal interaction, such as the changing scenery as the robot moves,\nspeech recognition errors, disfluent and complex multi-clause\nutterances, perspective-dependent utterances (\n\u201cIs the red box to the left of the blue box?\u201d), and deixis \n(\u201cGo down there\u201d). In\naddition, all of this must be integrated with physical action planned\nso as to fulfill the instructions as understood by the robot. While the\nability of recent robots to handle these difficulties to some degree is\nencouraging, many open problems remain, such as the problems of speech\nrecognition in the presence of noise, better, broader linguistic\ncoverage, parsing, and dialogue handling, adaptation to novel problems,\nmental modeling of the interlocutor and other humans in the\nenvironment, and greater general knowledge about the world and the\nability to use it for inference and planning (both at the domain level\nand the dialogue level).\nWhile task-oriented robot dialogues involve all these challenges,\nwe should note that some potentially useful interactions with\n\u201ctalking\u201d robots require little in the way of linguistic\nskills. For example, the Rubi robot described in\n(Movellan et al. 2009), displayed objects on its\nscreen-equipped \u201cchest\u201d to toddlers, asking them to touch\nand name the objects. This resulted in improved word learning by the\ntoddlers, despite the simplicity of the interaction. Another example\nof a very successful talking robot with no real linguistic skills was\nthe \u201cmuseum tour guide\u201d Rhino\n(Burgard et al. 1999). Unlike Rubi it was able\nto navigate among unpredictably moving humans, and kept its audience\nengaged with its prerecorded messages and with a display of its\ncurrent goals on a screen. In the same way, numerous humanoid robots\n(for example, Honda's Asimo) under past and present development across\nthe world still understand very little language and rely mostly on\nscripted output. No doubt their utility and appeal will continue to\ngrow, thanks to technologies like those mentioned above\u2014games,\ncompanionable agent systems, voice-based apps, tutors, and so on; and\nthese developments will also fuel progress on the deeper aspects of\nperception, motion, manipulation, and meaningful dialogue.\n\n",
