    "main_text": "The Problems of Metaphysics: the \u201cNew\u201d Metaphysics || Persistence and Constitution\n3.3 Persistence and Constitution\n\nRelated to questions about the nature of space and time are questions\nabout the nature of objects that take up space or persist through\ntime, and these questions form yet another central theme in\npost-medieval metaphysics. Are some or all objects composed of proper\nparts? Must an object have proper parts in order to \u201cfill\nup\u201d a region of space\u2014or are there extended simples? Can\nmore that one object be located in exactly the same region? Do objects\npersist through change by having temporal parts?\n\nMuch work on persistence and constitution has focused on efforts to\naddress a closely knit family of puzzles\u2014the puzzles of\ncoincidence. One such puzzle is the \u201cproblem of the statue and\nthe lump\u201d. Consider a gold statue. Many metaphysicians contend\nthat there is at least one material object that is spatially\nco-extensive with the statue, a lump of gold. This is easily shown,\nthey say, by an appeal to Leibniz\u2019s Law (the principle of the\nnon-identity of discernibles). There is a statue here and there is a\nlump of gold here, and\u2014if the causal story of the statue\u2019s\ncoming to be is of the usual sort\u2014the lump of gold existed\nbefore the statue. And even if God has created the statue (and\nperforce the lump) ex nihilo and will at some point\nannihilate the statue (and thereby annihilate the lump), they further\nargue, the statue and the lump, although they exist at exactly the\nsame times, have different modal properties: the lump has the property\n\u201ccan survive radical deformation\u201d and the statue does not.\nOr so these metaphysicians conclude. But it has seemed to other\nmetaphysicians that this conclusion is absurd, for it is absurd to\nsuppose (these others say) that there could be spatially coincident\nphysical objects that share all their momentary non-modal properties.\nHence, the problem: What, if anything, is the flaw in the argument for\nthe non-identity of the statue and the lump?\n\nA second puzzle in this family is the \u201cproblem of Tib and\nTibbles\u201d. Tibbles is a cat. Call his tail \u201cTail\u201d.\nCall all of him but his tail \u201cTib\u201d. Suppose Tail is cut\noff\u2014or, better, annihilated. Tibbles still exists, for a cat can\nsurvive the loss of its tail. And it would seem that Tib will exist\nafter the \u201closs\u201d of Tail, because Tib lost no part. But\nwhat will be the relation between Tib and Tibbles? Can it be identity?\nNo, that is ruled out by the non-identity of discernibles, for Tibbles\nwill have become smaller and Tib will remain the same size. But then,\nonce again, we seem to have a case of spatially coincident material\nobjects that share their momentary non-modal properties.\n\nBoth these constitution problems turn on questions about the\nidentities of spatially coincident objects\u2014and, indeed, of\nobjects that share all their (proper) parts. (A third famous problem\nof material constitution\u2014the problem of the Ship of\nTheseus\u2014raises questions of a different sort.) Some\nmetaphysicians contend that the relation between the lump and the\nstatue, on the one hand, and the relation between Tib and Tibbles, on\nthe other, cannot be fully understood in terms of the concepts of\nparthood and (non-) identity, but require a further concept, a\nnon-mereological concept, the concept of \u201cconstitution\u201d:\nthe pre-existent lump at a certain point in time comes to constitute\nthe statue (or a certain quantity of gold or certain gold atoms that\nfirst constituted only the lump come to constitute them both);\npre-existent Tib at a certain point in time comes to constitute\nTibbles (or certain cat-flesh or certain molecules \u2026). (Baker\n2000 is a defense of this thesis.) Others contend that all the\nrelations between the objects that figure in both problems can be\nfully analyzed in terms of parthood and identity. For a more thorough\noverview of the solutions to these puzzles and different theories of\nconstitution in play, see Rea (ed.) 1997 and Thomson 1998.\n",
