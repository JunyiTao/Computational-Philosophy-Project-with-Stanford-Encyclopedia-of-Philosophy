    "main_text": "Moral principles || The supreme moral principle\n3.2 The supreme moral principle\n\nAquinas is regrettably inexplicit about how the first practical\nprinciples yield moral principles, precepts or rules that have the\ncombined generality and specificity of the precepts found in the\nportion of the biblical Decalogue (Exod. 20.1\u201317;\nDeut. 5.6\u201321) traditionally called moral (the last\nseven precepts, e.g. parents should be reverenced, murder is wrong,\nadultery is wrong, etc.). But a reconstruction of his scattered\nstatements makes it clear enough that in his view a first implication\nof the array of first principles, each directing us to goods\nactualisable as much in others as in oneself, is this: that one should\nlove one\u2019s neighbor as oneself.\n\nSince he considers this principle, like the set of first principles\nmentioned in I-II q. 94 a. 2, to be self-evident (per se\nnotum), he must regard the principle of love-of-neighbor-as-self\nnot so much as an inference from, or even specification of, but rather\na redescriptive summary of that set. This in turn suggests the further\nreflection that the first principles, and the goods (bona) to\nwhich they direct us, are transparent, so to speak, for the\nflesh-and-blood persons in whom they are and can be instantiated.\nMoreover, it may be thought that the primary moral principle of love\nof neighbor as oneself is another reason to doubt (despite\nappearances) the strategic role of eudemonism in his ethics.\nAristotelianising interpretations of Aquinas\u2019 ethics normally\nmake central the notion of fulfillment, understood (it seems) as the\nfulfillment of the deliberating and acting person \u2013 to which the\nrequirement of neighbor love does not have a perspicuous relationship.\nGrisez and others, on the other hand, take it that the role of\nfulfillment (eudaimonia, beatitudo) in ethical\nthought\u2019s unfolding from the first principles of practical\nreason is best captured by a \u201cmaster moral principle\u201d\nclose though perhaps not identical to Aquinas\u2019s supreme moral\nprinciple: that all one\u2019s acts of will be open to integral\nhuman fulfillment, that is to the fulfillment of all human\npersons and communities now and in future.\n\nThe supreme moral principle of love of neighbor as self has, Aquinas\nthinks, an immediately proximate specification in the Golden Rule:\nOthers are to be treated by me as I would wish them to treat me. The\ntight relation between the love principle and the Golden Rule suggests\nthat love and justice, though analytically distinguishable, certainly\ncannot be contrasted as other and other. \u201cNeighbor\u201d\nexcludes no human being anywhere, insofar as anyone could be benefited\nby one\u2019s choices and actions. To love someone is essentially to\nwill that person\u2019s good. The reasonable priorities among all\nthese persons as objects of one\u2019s love, goodwill and care are\ndiscussed by Aquinas both as an \u201corder of love(s)\u201d\n[ordo amoris] and as a matter of right and justice.\n3.2.1 The fuller version: the place of the transcendent\n\nSince Aquinas thinks that the existence and providence of God, as the\ntranscendent source of all persons and benefits, is certain, his usual\nstatement of the master moral principle affirms that one should love\nGod and one\u2019s-neighbor-as-oneself. But since he accepts that the\nexistence of God is not self-evident, he can allow that the more\nstrictly self-evident form of the master moral principle refers only\nto love of human persons (self and neighbors). He would add that, once\nthe existence and nature of God is accepted, as it philosophically\nshould be, the rational requirement of loving God, and thus the fuller\nversion of the master moral principle, is self-evident. He also holds\nthat one does not offend against this requirement of loving God except\nby making choices contrary to human good, that is, to love of self or\nneighbor: ScG III c. 122 n. 2.\n",
