    "main_text": "Hermeneutics as Historical Movement || The Art of Interpretation\n2.1 The Art of Interpretation\n\nIn accord with a common account of the modern historical origins of\nhermeneutics, recognizably philosophical contributions to hermeneutics\noriginate with Friedrich\n Schleiermacher.[3]\n Closely associated with German romanticism, Schleiermacher developed\nhis hermeneutics in the first decades of the nineteenth century. He\nproposes a universal hermeneutics that pertains to all linguistic\nexperience, and not just to the interpretative concerns of specific\ndisciplines (Scholtz 2015, 68). Schleiermacher characterizes\nhermeneutics as the art of interpretation, maintaining that this art\nis called for not simply to avoid misunderstandings in regard to\notherwise readily intelligible discourses. Rather, the art of\ninterpretation is necessary for discourses, paradigmatically written\ntexts, in regard to which our interpretive experience begins in\nmisunderstanding (Schleiermacher, \u201cOutline,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7\n15\u201316). Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics is multifaceted but\nkeyed to the idea that the success of understanding depends on the\nsuccessful interpretation of two sides of a discourse, the\n\u2018grammatical\u2019 and \u2018psychological\u2019\n(Schleiermacher, \u201cOutline,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 5\u20136). By\nthe \u2018grammatical\u2019 side, he means the contributions to the\nmeaning of the discourse dependent on the general structure of the\nlanguage it uses. By the \u2018psychological\u2019 side, he has in\nview the contributions to the meaning of the discourse dependent on\nthe individual author\u2019s or creator\u2019s mind. Whereas the\n\u2018grammatical\u2019 side of a discourse is a matter of general\nlinguistic structures, the \u2018psychological\u2019 side finds\nexpression in linguistic forms that would traditionally be associated\nwith style.\n\nSchleiermacher indicates that discourses can be differentiated by\nwhether they are predominated by the \u2018grammatical\u2019 or\n\u2018psychological\u2019 and he develops methodological\nconsiderations appropriate to these sides. At the same time, though,\nhe recognizes that the interpretation of each side is reciprocally\ninformed by the other (see Schleiermacher, \u201cOutline,\u201d\n\u00a7 11, \u00a7 12). Interpretation aims at the\n\u201creconstruction\u201d of the meaning of a discourse, but, in\nthis, the task is \u201cto understand the discourse just as well or\neven better than its creator,\u201d a task which, accordingly, is\n\u201cinfinite\u201d (Schleiermacher, \u201cOutline,\u201d \u00a7\n18).\n",
