Signs of the Divine: Eckhart\u2019s \u201cMetaphysics of Analogy\u201d\n\nMuch has been written on the extent to which Eckhart\u2019s views on\nanalogy draw on and/or depart from those of his philosophical\npredecessors (e.g., Aristotle, Proclus, Augustine, Maimonides, Albert\nthe Great, Dietrich of Freiberg, Henry of Ghent, and especially Thomas\nAquinas)\u2014as well as on whether his approach endorses an analogy\nof attribution, proportionality, or both/neither. Earlier scholars\ntended to view Eckhart\u2019s doctrine of analogy as largely\nderivative of (and perhaps even deficient by comparison with) these\nscholars, but more recent work has focused on the ways in which his\nposition represents something distinctive and innovative. (For a\ncomprehensive overview, see Hackett & Weed 2013.) In any case,\nlike his medieval contemporaries, Eckhart saw analogy as an important\nmeans of spelling out the relationship between God and creatures.\n\nThere were several understandings of analogy in play in the late\nmiddle ages, but the theories one is most likely to encounter have to\ndo with either the so-called \u201canalogy of attribution\u201d or\nthe \u201canalogy of proportionality\u201d. Different thinkers\nemployed these terms in different ways, but in general \u201canalogy\nof attribution\u201d was used to refer to a relation between items in\nwhich some predicate or property is \u201cproperly\u201d or\n\u201cprimarily\u201d said of one of the objects of comparison,\nwhile the others are related to it in a lesser,\n\u201cderivative\u201d or \u201csecondary\u201d sense (e.g.,\ncausally or as a sign). \u201cAnalogy of proportionality\u201d, on\nthe other hand, postulates some relevant similarity in the way the\nsubject and predicate of the respective objects of comparison are\nrelated. The former approach to analogy maintains the radical\n(ontological, epistemological, and semantic) gulf between God and\ncreatures. It thereby helped medieval theologians guard against\nworries concerning idolatry and the anthropomorphization of God, while\nstill allowing them to positively identify conceptual lines along\nwhich a (usually causal) relationship could be postulated between God\nand creatures with respect to a particular attribute or property. The\nlatter approach, however, preserves the intuition that our human\nlanguage can actually express genuine truths about God without\ncommitting a category mistake, thereby helping to bridge the gap\nbetween God and creatures (Tobin 1986: 35).\n\nWith respect to the transcendental perfections discussed at the\nbeginning of\n Section 6,\n Aquinas had attempted to \u201csynthesize\u201d analogy of\nattribution and proportionality in what is sometimes called an\n\u201canalogy of participation\u201d. Roughly speaking, he proposed\nthat God has being, wisdom, goodness, and unity essentially, whereas\ncreatures can only be said to be (and to be good, wise, one,\netc.) in a secondary and deficient sense\u2014and only insofar as\nthey \u201cshare\u201d or \u201cparticipate\u201d in these\nproperties as they are in God, of whom they are properly and primarily\npredicated, and with respect to whom they stand in a relation of\ncausal dependence (Ashworth & D\u2019Ettore 2021). However, even\n(or especially) with respect to being, Aquinas appears to\nhave thought that, despite the immense gulf between God and creatures,\n\u201cbeing\u201d could be properly attributed to both God and\ncreatures (Tobin 1986: 35). Even though God is Being whereas\ncreatures only \u201chave\u201d being, in some important sense\ncreatures still have their own \u201cproper being\u201d (Hackett\n& Weed 2013: 219).\n\nEckhart, too, seems to have a doctrine of analogy that makes\nparticipation central to understanding the relation between God and\ncreatures, but he goes beyond both mere attribution and structural\nproportionality to a more radical participational view than that\nespoused by his Dominican predecessor. Like Aquinas, he agrees that\n\u201cGod alone properly speaking exists and is called being, one,\ntrue, and good\u201d, and he further agrees that \u201ceverything\nthat is being, one, true, or good does not have this from itself but\nfrom God and from him alone\u201d (Prol. gen., n.4; LW\nI:132; PQP 79). However, whereas Thomas indicates that attributes like\n\u201cbeing\u201d or \u201cgoodness\u201d can be predicated of\nboth God and creatures (albeit to radically different degrees or\nlevels of perfection), Eckhart restricts the proper attribution of\npredicates to only one of the analogates:\n\n\nThe things which are analogous to something have nothing in themselves\nby which they are in a positive way rooted to the form which is the\nbasis of the analogy. (In Eccli. n.53; LW II:282; quoted in\nTobin 1986: 45)\n\n\nPace Aquinas, then, on Eckhart\u2019s approach creatures do\nnot have their own \u201cproper\u201d, albeit derivative, being. Any\nbeing creatures might be said to have can only be\n\u201cborrowed\u201d (Hackett & Weed 2013). Or, as he puts\nit:\n\n\n[E]very created being radically and positively possesses existence,\nlife, a wisdom from and in God, not in themselves as a created being.\n(ibid.; TP 178)\n\n\nLikewise, the goodness of creatures is not an \u201cimperfect\u201d\nor \u201csecondary\u201d way of instantiating what God exhibits\nperfectly. It simply is God\u2019s goodness to which the\ncreature\u2019s goodness refers. Considered in and of themselves,\ncreatures and their properties are nothing\u2014mere \u201csigns\npointing to what is real\u201d (Tobin 1986: 64).\n\nIn this sense, the relation of analogy for Eckhart is not a matter of\ndegree or level of perfection, nor is there any form of proportional\nsymmetry in the relations between subject and predicate in God and\ncreatures. There is only one proper attribution of the predicates\n\u201cis\u201d, \u201cone\u201d, \u201cwise\u201d, and\n\u201cgood\u201d, namely to God, and their attribution to any other\nbeing merely refers one immediately back to the divine essence. So in\nGod the predicate \u201cis-good\u201d and goodness express a\nrelation of (essential) identity, whereas in creatures, \u201cis\ngood\u201d is merely related to God\u2019s goodness in the mode of a\nsign. Eckhart tries to explain this idea in his defense against the\nlist of 49 articles brought against him. There, he claims that\n\n\nthe good man and goodness are one. The good man insofar as he is good\nsignifies [God\u2019s] goodness alone, just as something white\nsignifies only the quality of whiteness.\n\n\nHe continues:\n\n\nThese two things, being good and goodness, are univocally one in the\nFather, Son and Holy Spirit. They are analogically one in God and in\nus considered as good. (Resp. n.82; LW V:278; EE 73)\n\n\nStill, even if God and creatures differ with respect to the modes in\nwhich they signify the divine perfections, it nevertheless appears\nthat, for Eckhart, the meaning (in the sense of ratio\npropria) of terms like \u201cbeing\u201d,\n\u201cgoodness\u201d, \u201cunity\u201d, \u201cwisdom\u201d, is\nunivocal whether said of God or creatures, even if it is God alone who\nis properly the subject of such attributions. (On the significance of\nunivocity in Eckhart\u2019s doctrine of analogy, see Mojsisch 1983\n[2001].) This might lead one to question whether his doctrine really\nis one of analogy at all.\n\nWhatever the case, like many medieval thinkers, Eckhart\u2019s\nmetaphysics and semantics were deeply, perhaps inextricably,\nintertwined. This makes things doubly difficult for Eckhart as a\nphilosopher and theologian, since it might turn out on his view that\nthere is very little we can say about anything whatsoever. For\nexample, with respect to ourselves as creatures, if we care about the\ncultivation of virtues and the pursuit of the good life, we want to be\nable to talk about things like \u201cthis just woman\u201d or\n\u201cthat virtuous person\u201d. We also tend to naturally speak of\nourselves as though we really exist, have properties, do\nthings, think about stuff, gain knowledge, and so on. But if we really\n\u201care\u201d nothing more than mere signs pointing to the divine\nessence, it would seem that there is very little we can say about\nour-selves at all. With respect to God, on the other hand,\nthe problem is exactly reversed, especially for theologians like\nEckhart with strong apophatic leanings who think that the divine\nradically transcends the limits of human language. If terms like\n\u201cbeing\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cone\u201d are all\nonly \u201cproperly\u201d predicated of the divine essence, yet that\nessence is simultaneously thought to radically surpass all human\nunderstanding, let alone anything we might say about it, then it might\nseem the most appropriate approach to God is simply to remain\nsilent.\n\nThis is certainly an attitude Eckhart sometimes appears to endorse, as\nwhen he writes that \u201cthe very best and noblest attainment in\nthis life is to be silent and let God work and speak within\u201d\n(Pr. 101; DW IV/1:355; MW 33). Yet despite his insistent\ninjunctions to move past concrete \u201cimages\u201d and ultimately\nto give up the attempt to \u201ccapture\u201d God in language,\nsymbol, or story (see\n Section 9\n below), his hermeneutical approach as discussed above together with\nthe rich imagery he employs in his preaching (e.g., the images of the\nGodhead as pregnant mother, desert, abyss, wilderness, etc., as well\nas the descriptions of the uncreated \u201cground\u201d of the soul\nas a castle, a spark, a nobleman, etc.) imply that the Meister thought\nthat imagery and positive language about God (and creatures) had at\nleast some role to play in helping the individual make both epistemic\nand spiritual progress (Griffioen & Zahedi 2018).\n\nEckhart\u2019s use of the qualifier in quantum is again key\nhere. This \u201creduplication\u201d, as he calls it, is used to\n\u201cexclude from the term in question everything that is other or\nforeign to it even according to reason\u201d (Resp. n.81; LW\nV:277; EE 72). Take the example of a caterpillar. If we are\nconsidering it merely insofar as it is a locomotive animal,\nand we understand animal legs merely as \u201cweight-bearing\nanatomical structures used for locomotion\u201d, it might not be\ninappropriate to say that a caterpillar has 16 legs. However, the\ncaterpillar will someday turn into a butterfly, and butterflies are\ninsects. If we are therefore specifically considering the caterpillar\ninsofar as it is an insect, and given that insects per\ndefinitionem have 6 legs, it will be more appropriate to\nunderstand the caterpillar as having 6 legs and to characterize the\nother weight-bearing locomotive structures differently\u2014e.g., as\n\u201cprolegs\u201d. We can also consider it insofar as it is, e.g.,\na living thing, a creature, a being, or very hungry\u2014and what\ncounts as a fitting characterization of it may change according to the\nconceptual, metaphysical, and pragmatic restrictions imposed on it by\nthe qualifying class or context to which it is indexed. In this sense,\nthen, Eckhart thinks that it is not always inappropriate to speak of\ncreatures as possessing \u201cbeing\u201d or even as \u201cbeing\nwise\u201d or \u201cbeing good\u201d, so long as we always keep in\nmind that when we speak of the creature insofar as it has\nbeing, we are speaking about created being\u2014i.e.,\n\u201cborrowed\u201d being\u2014not \u201cabsolute\u201d or\n\u201cpure\u201d being. So even if created beings are technically\n\u201cnothing\u201d when compared to the divine esse,\ninsofar as they are considered under the aspect of their\ncreatureliness, they may appropriately be said to possess being,\ntruth, goodness, and unity, albeit in a radically qualified and\nrestricted sense that always necessarily points back to the\ndivine.\n\nImportantly, invoking the in quantum qualifier does not\nrequire sacrificing metaphysical or conceptual precision. In fact, the\nuse of in quantum indicates both a logical and a metaphysical\nconnection between two terms that can only be set in relation to each\nanother if the one is related to the other as a mode or sign\n(Beccarisi 2013: 122). If anything, such qualifications are supposed\nto better preserve precision by clarifying which aspects of the\nsubject are under discussion in which context. Eckhart is therefore\ncareful to consistently apply the driving principle behind his\ndoctrine of analogy\u2014namely, that what is said of one analogate\nmust be denied of the other. (This derives from a causal principle the\nMeister cites from the Book of Causes that \u201cnothing is\nformally in both a cause and its effect if the cause is a true\ncause\u201d: Par. Qu. 1 n.9; LW V:43; PQP 48.) When combined\nwith the in quantum-strategy, this allows Eckhart\u2019s use\nof analogy to be \u201creversible\u201d, especially as concerns\nesse and intelligere (McGinn 2001: 92). That is, if\nwe are speaking of God as an eternally creative and overflowing\nplenitude of being, then in predicating \u201cbeing\u201d of God we\nmust deny it of creatures and affirm their nothingness. On the other\nhand, if we are concerned with the existence of creatures (or with\nconstruing \u201cbeing\u201d as the first of created things, as per\nthe Book of Causes), then we must reject the attribution of\nbeing to God (Beccarisi 2013: 113). In the latter case,\nintelligere becomes a clearer and more appropriate way of\nspeaking about the divine than esse, given the special kind\nof non-being that constitutes intellect (insofar as it is pure\nintellect), as discussed above. Consequently, when we view\nourselves as genuinely existing beings, we are considering the human\nbeing in the mode of creaturely existence, and this appropriately\nretains the gulf between the divine-qua-creator and the human\nbeing-qua-created. However, when we view ourselves as\n\u201cnothing\u201d in comparison to the absolute being of the\ndivine, we locate in that nothingness the very mode in which human\nbeings are made ad imaginem Dei\u2014namely, insofar as they\npossess that very same mode of non-being, i.e., intellect. In\nthis way, Eckhart\u2019s \u201cmetaphysics of analogy\u201d (Libera\n1980) attempts to preserve intuitions concerning both God\u2019s\nutter transcendence and the real presence of God in creation.\n\nNevertheless, adherence to these two principles\u2014the in\nquantum-principle and the analogical principle\u2014might also\ntake Eckhart\u2019s semantics past traditional scholastic metaphysics\nand to usher his audience into a dialectical space in which, for\nexample, negation can itself be negated to come to an even deeper\nunderstanding of God\u2019s utter fullness and transcendence (which,\nparadoxically, is what Eckhart thinks is needed to allow the\nindividual to be capable of apprehending God\u2019s utter\nimmanence in the ground of the soul, as will be discussed\nbelow). For example, when Eckhart discusses unum with respect\nto God, he notes that\n\n\nthe term \u201cone\u201d is a negative word but is in reality\naffirmative. Moreover, it is the negation of negation which is the\npurest form of affirmation and the fullness of the term affirmed.\n(In Sap. n.147; LW II:485; TP 167)\n\n\nElsewhere, he clarifies:\n\n\nThe One itself is the negation of [the] negation [\u2026] which\nevery multitude that is opposed to the One includes. The negation of\nnegation is the core, the purity, and the repetition of the\naffirmation of existence. \u201cI am who am\u201d. (In Ioh.\nn.556; LW III:485; TP 185)\n\n\nAs Bernard McGinn puts it, the divine unity\n\n\n\u201cnegates\u201d everything that we know \u201cis\u201d; but\nthe negation of all that is [\u2026] opens up vistas into a new\nworld in which our distinctions between what is and what is not no\nlonger pertain. God as negatio negationis is simultaneously\ntotal emptiness and supreme fullness. (McGinn 2001: 93\u201394)\n\n\nStill, this understanding of unum as negatio\nnegationis is not mere wordplay; it represents an attempt on\nEckhart\u2019s part to explode the strict conceptual divide between\nwhat-is and what-is-not that permeates and constrains human thought\nand language.\n",
