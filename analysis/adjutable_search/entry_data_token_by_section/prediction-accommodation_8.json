    "main_text": "The Null Support Thesis || Severe Tests\n6.4 Severe Tests\n\nDeborah Mayo has argued (particularly in Mayo 1991, 1996, and 2014)\nthat the intuition that predictivism is true derives from a premium on\nsevere tests of hypotheses. A test of a hypothesis H is severe\nto the extent that H is unlikely to pass that test if H\nis false. Intuitively, if a novel consequence N is shown to\nfollow from H, and the probability of N on the\nassumption \\({\\sim}H\\) is very low (for the reason of its being\nnovel), then testing for N would seem to count as a severe test\nof H, and a positive outcome should strongly support H.\nHere novelty and severity appear to coincide\u2014but Mayo observes\nthat there are cases in which they come apart. For example, it has\nseemed to many that if H is built to fit some body of evidence\nE then the fact that H fits E does not support\nH because this fit does not constitute H\u2019s having\nsurvived a severe test (or a test at all). One of Mayo\u2019s central\nobjectives is to expose the fallacies that this latter reasoning\ninvolves.\n\nGiere (1984: 161, 163) affirms that evidence H was built to fit\ncannot support H because, given how H was built, it was\ndestined to fit that evidence. Mayo summarizes his reasoning as\nfollows:\n\n(1) If H is\nuse-constructed, then a successful fit is assured no matter\nwhat.\n\n\nBut Mayo notes that \u2018no matter what\u2019 can be interpreted in\ntwo ways: (a) no matter what the data are, and (b) no matter whether\nH is true or false. (1) is true when interpreted as (a), but in\norder to establish that accommodated evidence fails to support\nH (as Giere intends) (1) must be interpreted as (b). However,\n(1) is false when so interpreted. Mayo (1996: 271) illustrates this\nwith a simple example: let the evidence e be a list of SAT\nscores from students in a particular class. Use this evidence to\ncompute the average score x, and set h = the mean SAT\nscore for these students is x. Now of course h has been\nuse-constructed from e. It is true that whatever mean score was\ncomputed would fit the data no matter what the data are\u2014but\nhardly true that h would have fit the evidence no matter\nwhether h was true or false. If h were false it would\nnot fit the data, because the data will inevitably fit only a true\nhypothesis. Thus h has passed a maximally severe test: it is\nvirtually impossible for h to fit the data if h is\nfalse\u2014despite the fact that h is built to fit e.\n\n\nMayo gives an additional example of how a use-constructed hypothesis\ncan count as having survived a severe test that pertains to the famous\n1919 Eddington eclipse experiment of Einstein\u2019s General Theory\nof Relativity. GTR predicted that starlight that passed by the sun\nwould be bent to a specific degree (specifically 1.75 arcseconds).\nThere were actually two expeditions carried out during the\neclipse\u2014one to Sobral in Northern Brazil and the other to the\nisland of Principe in the Gulf of Guinea. Each expedition generated a\nresult that supported GTR, but there was a third result generated by\nthe Sobral expedition that appeared to refute GTR. This result was\nhowever disqualified because it was determined that a mirror used to\nacquire the images of the stars\u2019 position had been damaged by\nthe heat of the sun. While one might worry that such dismissing of\nanomalous evidence was the kind of ad hoc adjustment that Popper\nwarned against, Mayo notes that this is instead a perfectly legitimate\ncase of using evidence to support a hypothesis (that the third result\nwas unreliable) that amounted to that hypothesis having passed a\nsevere test. Mayo concludes that a general prohibition on\nuse-constructed hypothesis \u201cfails to distinguish between\nproblematic and unproblematic use-constructions (or double\ncountings)\u201d (1996: 285). However, Hudson (2003) argues that\nthere is historical evidence that suggests there was legitimate reason\nto question the hypothesis that the third result was unreliable (he\nuses this point to support his own contention that the fact that a\nhypothesis was use-constructed is prima facie evidence that the\nhypothesis is suspect). Mayo (2003) replies that insofar as the third\nresult was nonetheless suspect the physicists involved were right to\ndiscard it. \n\nMayo (1996: Ch. 9) defends a predictivist-like position attributed to\nNeyman-Pearson statistical methods\u2014the prohibition on\nafter-trial constructions of hypotheses. To illustrate: Kish (1959)\ndescribes a study that investigated the statistical relationship\nbetween a large number of infant training experiences (nursing, toilet\ntraining, weaning, etc.) and subsequent personality and behavioral\ntraits (e.g., school adjustment, nail biting, etc.) The study found a\nnumber of high correlations between certain training experience and\nlater traits. The problem was that the study investigated so many\ntraining experiences that it was quite likely that some correlations\nwould appear in the data simply by chance\u2014even if there would\nultimately prove to be no such correlation. An investigator who\nstudied many possible correlations thus could survey that data and\nsimply look for statistically significant differences and proclaim\nevidence for correlations despite such evidence being\nmisleading\u2014thus engaging in the dubious practice of the\n\u2018after-trial construction of\n hypothesis\u2019.[10]\n Mayo notes that such hypotheses should not count as having passed a\nsevere test, thus she endorses the Neyman-Pearson prohibition on such\nconstruction. Hitchcock and Sober (2004) note that Mayo\u2019s\ndefinition of severity as applied in this case differs from the one\nshe employs in dealing with cases like her SAT example; Mayo (2008)\nreplies at length to their criticism and argues that while she does\nemploy two versions of the severity definition they nonetheless\nreflect a unified conception of severity.\n\nFor critical discussion of Mayo\u2019s account see Iseda 1999 and\nWorrall 2006: 56\u201360, 2010: 145\u2013153\u2014see also\nMayo\u2019s (1996: 265f, 2010) replies to Worrall. \n",
