    "main_text": "Other Examples of Replicators || Sociocultural Evolution\n4.2 Sociocultural Evolution\n\nThe temptation to regard cultures and societies as evolving entities\nin a way analogous to organisms has a long tradition. In The\nSelfish Gene (Chapter 11), Dawkins proposes a version of it that\nmakes use of the concept of the replicator. He chose the word\n\u201cmeme\u201d for a sociocultural replicator due to its\nsimilarities with the word gene:\n\n\nWe need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of\na unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.\n\u2018Mimeme\u2019 comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a\nmonosyllable that sounds a bit like \u2018gene\u2019 (Dawkins 1976:\n192).\n\n\nThe basic idea underlying Dawkins\u2019 proposal is that since\nevolution by natural selection in the biological domain requires\nreplication, it must also be the case in the sociocultural domain, and\nthat imitation, at least in many cases, is the way through which\nsociocultural entities, the memes, replicate.\n\nImportant differences exist between sociocultural evolution and\nbiological evolution (Claidi\u00e8re & Andr\u00e9 2012) [see\nthe entry on\n cultural evolution].\n For example, Dawkins (1976) admits that he is on shaky ground when it\ncomes to the high-fidelity copying required of replicators. Memes seem\nto get changed much more frequently than genes (see Sterelny (2006)\nfor a review). In general, however, it is fair to say that the\nstandards used to evaluate sociocultural transmission are not on par\nwith those used to evaluate biological transmission. An overly\nidealized view of Mendelian genetics is contrasted with a much more\nrealistic view of cultural change. So the criticism goes, one problem\nwith memes is that they do not have discrete boundaries, do not all\ncome in the same size, and, in their functioning, are strongly\ninfluenced by their environments. Genes, so the critics claim, have\nsharp boundaries, are all of the same size, and are immune to\nenvironmental influences. If sociocultural evolution is to be\nevaluated fairly, the same level of criticism must be applied to all\nputative examples of selection, from gene-based selection in\nbiological evolution and the reaction of the immune system to antigens\nto the development of the central nervous system and social learning\n(Hull et al. 2001). The collection of articles in Aunger (2000)\npresent the arguments for and against a memetic approach to\nculture, and a more recent discussion is available in Lewens\n(2015).\n\nDawkins (1976) also places considerable emphasis on human brains as\nthe \u201cvehicles\u201d for memetic evolution. He defines\n\u201cmeme\u201d as an entity capable of being transmitted from one\nbrain to another. Computers are also plausible vehicles for memes, as\nwell as artifacts more generally, which can \u201cstore\u201d and\nthen release information when a copy of the artifact is made by\nemulation (mimesis): that is, without the presence of a\ndemonstration. However, Dawkins\u2019 discussion of memes\nis marred by the pervasiveness of the gene-organism perspective.\nFor example, he defines \u201creplicator\u201d in terms of\ntransmission of information\u2014memes leaping from brain to brain or\nfrom brains to computers and back again. But, memes do not leap from\nbrain to brain or from computer to computer. Their content is\ntransmitted in a variety of ways, including books, audiotapes,\nconversations, and the like. As much as the physical basis changes,\nthe message remains sufficiently unchanged. All instances of this\nmessage are equally memes, not just the ones residing in human brains\nand computers.\n\nSeveral accounts of memetic replication have been proposed in the\nliterature. Some consider that there is no replication in cultural\nevolution, but that memes are \u201cattractor points\u201d in\nculture (Atran 1998). Others consider that the interactor is the meme\nitself (Blackmore 1999) or that the meme is the selected cultural\nheritable information, just as Williams\u2019 \u201cevolutionary\ngene\u201d is the selected genetic heritable information, and the\nmemetic interactor is the repertoire of behaviors it elicits (Wilkins\n1998). One view that has been offered several times is that memes are\nactive neural structures (Aunger 1998, 2002; Delius 1991).\n\nAll the objections to the gene-meme analogy to one side, Dawkins\n(1976: 211) finds the chief difference between genetic and memetic\nchange is that biological evolution is at bottom a war between alleles\nresiding at the same locus: \u201cMemes seem to have nothing\nequivalent to chromosomes and nothing equivalent to alleles\u201d.\nFirst, the usual depiction of alleles residing at the same locus on\nhomologous chromosomes so central to Mendelian genetics is an\noversimplification; but, and more importantly, for at least half of\nthe history of life on earth, replication and selection took place in\nthe absence of chromosomes, meiosis, and the like. If gene-based\nbiological evolution took place for so long in the absence of the\nMendelian apparatus and still does so in many extant organisms, then\ndemanding that memetic evolution proceeds by this very special and\npossibly aberrant sort of inheritance seems too strong. The cost of\nmeiosis remains a serious problem in ordinary biological evolution.\nDemanding that cultural evolution incorporates this same highly\nproblematic element in its own makeup seems strange in the extreme. If\nwe are to develop a general analysis of selection, we must\ndistinguish between essential and contingent features of this\nprocess.\n\nNumerous evolutionary biologists question how fundamental to selection\nthe perspective of alleles at a locus actually is. Almost everyone\nagrees that evolution involves changes in gene frequencies. However,\nfew go on to add that evolution is nothing but changes in\ngene frequencies. When one looks at evolutionary biology, one\ndiscovers that it involves much more than changes in gene frequencies.\nTo be successful, memetic evolution must be fleshed out.\n\nIn 2000, Aunger summarized the disputes between proponents and\nskeptics of the memetic approach as revolving around three\nlevels:\n\n\nwhether culture is properly seen as composed of independently\ntransmitted information units;\nwhether these so-called memes have the necessary qualifications to\nserve as replicators; and\nwhether a Darwinian or selectionist approach such as memetics is\nthe most feasible or desirable form for a science of culture to take.\n(Aunger 2000: 11)\n\n\n\nHowever, over 20 years after the diagnosis, it seems that the\nmemetic approach has, by and large, been abandoned, with some of its\ninsights incorporated into other evolutionary approaches to culture.\nPerhaps the most successful is dual-inheritance theory (Richerson\n& Boyd 2008), also known as gene-culture coevolution. A very\ngeneral characterization of sociocultural evolution has been attempted\nby El Mouden, Andr\u00e9, Morin, and Nettle (2014). This approach,\nwhich relies on the most abstract formalism used by evolutionary\ntheorists\u2014namely, the Price equation (for an introduction to the\nPrice equation see Okasha 2006: Chapter 1)\u2014highlights some\nof the differences between biological and sociocultural evolution, and\nwhy a pure memetic approach seems difficult to implement as a general\nframework.\n",
