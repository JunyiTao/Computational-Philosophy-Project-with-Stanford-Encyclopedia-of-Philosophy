    "main_text": "Epistemological issues in applied geometry || Implications of mechanics\n2.1 Implications of mechanics\n\nPhysical space was the na\u00efve, three-dimensional version of the\nspace of Euclid\u2019s Elements and of Cartesian\ncoordinatised three-dimensional geometry, and this was how Newton had\nregarded it in his Principia Mathematica (1687). It was\nconceived of as a neutral arena, unaffected by matter or forces, but\nconditioning the movements of physical bodies under various kinds of\nforces. Chief among these was the force of gravity, which\nmathematicians in the Cartesian tradition regarded as a mysterious,\neven unacceptable, concept when it was introduced, but which by the\nstart of the 19th century had been shown by Laplace to be\ncapable of dealing well with all the known motions of the solar\nsystem. As a consequence, gravity had become a natural, primitive\nconcept no longer in need of further explanation, and by 1800 it was\nreasonable of people who worked on the new theories of magnetism and\nelectricity to consider them as forces and to model them, where\nappropriate, on Newtonian gravity.\n\nPhysical space, as described by Newton in his Principia, is\nto be studied by passing from observations of bodies in motion\nrelative to one another and timed by an arbitrary clock to the\ncorresponding true motion in absolute space and time. As Newton put it\nat the end of his first Scholium, the purpose of his treatise was to\nshow\n\n\nhow to determine true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent\ndifferences, and, conversely, of how to determine from motions,\nwhether true or apparent, their causes and effects.\n\n\nThere was clearly no doubt in Newton\u2019s mind about the Euclidean\nnature of physical space, and indeed there seems to have been no\ndoubts among astronomers in the 17th or 18th century that\nspace was describable in the terms used in Euclid\u2019s\nElements. It is also likely that the growing recognition of\nthe merits of Newton\u2019s physics cemented a belief that space was\nthree-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, and to be described as if\nit was an infinite coordinate grid, thus exemplifying the\ntheorems\u2014if not precisely the definitions\u2014of the\nElements.\n\nThe interaction between geometrical aspects of physical space, and\nmechanical behaviour of bodies, is clear in the statement of\nNewton's first law (see the entry on inertial frames):\n\n\nEvery body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving\nuniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to\nchange its state by forces impressed.\n\n\nThere is also the result that a homogeneous spherical solid exerts the\nsame gravitational effect on other bodies as would an equal mass\nconcentrated at the centre of the body. That is to say, such bodies\nbehave in a way that is provably, and not merely approximately, the\nsame as point masses. In this way points and lines acquire physical\nsignificance in his theory of dynamics.\n\nIt was Laplace who gave the strongest argument for saying that\nphysical space obeys Euclidean geometry. In his Exposition du\nsyst\u00e8me du monde of 1796 (see Book V, Ch. V, p. 472) he\nadded an interesting note (quoted in Bonola 1912: 54) to say that\n\n\nThe attempts of geometers to prove Euclid\u2019s Postulate on\nParallels have been up till now futile. However, no one can doubt this\npostulate and the theorems which Euclid deduced from it. Thus the\nnotion of space includes a special property, self-evident, without\nwhich the properties of parallels cannot be rigorously established.\nThe idea of a bounded region, e.g., the circle, contains nothing which\ndepends on its absolute magnitude. But if we imagine its radius to\ndiminish, we are brought without fail to the diminution in the same\nratio of its circumference and the sides of all the inscribed figures.\nThis proportionality appears to me a more natural postulate than that\nof Euclid, and it is worthy of note that it is discovered afresh in\nthe results of the theory of universal gravitation.\n\n\nThis is strikingly similar to the view of Wallis well over a century\nbefore, although Laplace did not mention Wallis and may not have known\nof his discussion on the parallel postulate.\n\nAround 1800, therefore, it was generally true that problems with the\ntruth claims of Euclidean geometry had been located among the problems\nabout our knowledge of the external world. Confidence in philosophical\nand scientific circles in the validity of Euclidean geometry per se\nwas very high.\n",
