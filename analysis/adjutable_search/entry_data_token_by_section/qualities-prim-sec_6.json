Wilson 1993 [1999: 26\u201340]; Maull 1980: 31 and\n33);\nBoth intellect and the perceptual faculty have important parts in\nproducing perception of PQs and SQs (Simmons 2003; Ort\u00edn Nadal\n2019).\n\n3.3.1 Perceptual knowledge is bifurcated\n\nAdvocates of the first position point to several texts:\n\nthe proof that in general, sensory ideas are caused by a substance\nthat has all the qualities we clearly and distinctly perceive to exist\nin corporeal substance; clear and distinct perception is intellectual\n(CSM 2.55; AT 7.80; CSM 1.223; AT 8.40\u201341);\nthe pragmatic non-theoretical purpose of sense perception (CSM\n2.57; AT 7.82\u20133; CSM 1.224;AT 8.42);\nthe theory that we see distance by a natural geometry\n(Optics, CSM 1.170; AT 6.137\u201380);\nthe doctrine that we know PQs and SQs of objects in quite\ndifferent ways: \u201cour knowledge of what it is for an object to\nhave a shape is more clear than our knowledge of what it is for it be\ncoloured\u201d (CSM 1.18\u20139; AT 8.34).\n\n\nIn opposition, critics note that most of these passages concern\nfeatures of sense perception in general and the one exception is a\npassage that does not apply to sensory knowledge at all.\n\nPerception of the particular figures of particular things is less\ncertain than our knowledge that figures, etc. exist in the causes of\nour sensory ideas in general (CSM 2.27, 55, 57; AT 7.39, 80, 83); we\nmake mistakes about the size and distance of the sun.\nSense perception in general has a pragmatic purpose (CSM 2.57; AT\n7.82\u20133).\nOur initial visual ideas of distance are, like our initial ideas\nof all sensible qualities, direct effects of motions in and around the\npineal gland (Optics, CSM 1.167; AT 6.130; Hatfield\n2015).\nThe greater clarity of our knowledge of PQs is not manifested by\nsense perception but by reflection on what we know a priori\nabout the nature of corporeal substance and its modes (Ort\u00edn\nNadal 2019: 1129\u201331).\n\n3.3.2 Perceptual knowledge is unified\n\nIn support of the second position, Simmons (2003) constructs an\nargument based on the three grades of sensory response defined in\nSixth Replies (CSM 2.294\u201396; AT 7.437\u201339) and\nphysiological and psychological accounts,in Optics and\nTreatise on Man, of the operations that form experience in\nearly childhood. In brief: the first grade of sensory involvement\nstarts with impingement of particles on the organs of sense and\nincludes all their physiological effects; the second grade comprises\nthe immediate effects produced in the mind as a result of its union\nwith a body provided with sensory organs; the third grade, which is\nthe first to involve intellect, comprises all the \u201cjudgments\nabout things outside us we are accustomed to making in\nchildhood\u201d (CSM 2.295; AT 7.437). Simmons argues that the early\nscientific works ascribe two sorts of judgments to\nintellect\u2014those that falsely project resemblance and those that\nconstruct the appearances of sensible things. She finds that the\nlatter are associative cognitive acts that connect sensations of\nqualities with images drawn from memory (Simmons 2003: 554; on images\nand the intellect, see Letter to Mersenne, July 1641, CSM 3.186; AT\n3.395). The model of clear and distinct perception promoted in\nDescartes\u2019 later philosophical works hardly fits the\nconstruction of images and ill-considered judgments that engage the\nintellect of a young child (on the diversity of intellectual\noperations, see Simmons (2003: 565\u201375,\n 77\u20138).[4]\n The upshot is that sense perception of the world features PQs and SQs\nand its purpose is practical rather than scientific (CSM 2.57\u20138;\nAT 7.83; CSM 1.223\u20134; AT 8.41\u201342.) Once we attain clear\nand distinct a priori perception of the essence and\nproperties of bodies, we are unable to conceive how a body could\nresemble a sensory presentation of color, etc.\n\nAccording to Ort\u00edn Nadal (2019: 1129\u20131132), the\nfundamental difference between qualities of the two types is not that\nideas of SQs provide more material for error; in perception, specific\nideas of both sorts can misrepresent particular physical causes. They\ndiffer with regard to the mistakes we can make about their causes. To\njudge that a body resembles the sensation of a color is to error about\nthe nature of matter, whereas to make an error about the determinate\nPQ of a particular object is still to know that it has the\ndeterminable quality it comes under.\n",
