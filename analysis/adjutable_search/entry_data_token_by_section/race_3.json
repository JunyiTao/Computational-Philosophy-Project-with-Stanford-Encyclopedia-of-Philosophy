Race in Moral, Political and Legal Philosophy\n\nTwo strands in moral, political, and legal philosophy are pertinent to\nthe concept of race. One strand examines the broader conceptual and\nmethodological questions regarding the moral status of race and how to\ntheorize racial justice; the other strand normatively assesses\nspecific policies or institutional forms that seek to redress racial\ninequality, such as affirmative action, racially descriptive\nrepresentation, the general question of colorblindness in law and\npolicy, residential racial segregation, and racism in the criminal\njustice system and policing.\n\nLawrence Blum, Anthony Appiah, and Tommie Shelby articulate\nindispensable positions in addressing the moral status of the concept\nof race. Blum (2002) examines both the concept of race and the problem\nof racism. He argues that \u201cracism\u201d be restricted to two\nreferents: inferiorization, or the denigration of a group due\nto its putative biological inferiority; and antipathy, or the\n\u201cbigotry, hostility, and hatred\u201d towards another group\ndefined by its putatively inherited physical traits (2002, 8). These\ntwo moral sins deserve this heightened level of condemnation\nassociated with the term racism, because they violate moral norms of\n\u201crespect, equality, and dignity\u201d and because they are\nhistorically connected to extreme and overt forms of racial oppression\n(2002, 27). But because these connections make \u201cracism\u201d so\nmorally loaded a term, it should not be applied to \u201clesser\nracial ills and infractions\u201d that suggest mere ignorance,\ninsensitivity or discomfort regarding members of different groups\n(28), since doing so will apply a disproportionate judgment against\nthe person so named, closing off possible avenues for fruitful moral\ndialogue.\n\nDue to the historical connection between racism and extreme\noppression, Blum argues against using the term race, since he rejects\nits biological foundation. Instead, he advocates using the term\n\u201cracialized group\u201d to denote those socially constructed\nidentities whose supposedly inherited common physical traits are used\nto impose social, political, and economic costs. To Blum,\n\u201cracialized group\u201d creates distance from the biological\nconception of race and it admits of degrees, as in the case of\nLatinos, whom Blum describes as an \u201cincompletely racialized\ngroup\u201d (2002, 151). This terminological shift, and its supposed\nrevelation of the socially constructed character of physiognomically\ndefined identities, need not require the rejection of group-specific\npolicies such as affirmative action. Members of sociologically\nconstructed racialized identities suffer real harms, and laws might\nhave to distinguish individuals according to their racialized\nidentities in order to compensate for such harms. Nevertheless, Blum\nremains ambivalent about such measures, arguing that even when\nnecessary they remain morally suspect (2002, 97).\n\nSimilar ambivalence is also expressed by Anthony Appiah, earlier\ndiscussed regarding the metaphysics of race. While his metaphysical\nracial skepticism was cited as grounding his normative\nposition of eliminativism, Appiah is \u201cagainst\nraces\u201d but \u201cfor racial identities\u201d (1996). Because\nof a wide social consensus that races exist, individuals are ascribed\nto races regardless of their individual choices or desires. Moreover,\nracial identity remains far more salient and costly than ethnic\nidentity (1996, 80\u201381). As a result, mobilization along racial\nlines is justifiable, in order to combat racism. But even at this\npoint, Appiah still fears that racial identification may constrain\nindividual autonomy by requiring members of racial groups to behave\naccording to certain cultural norms or \u201cscripts\u201d that have\nbecome dominant within a specific racial group. Appiah thus concludes,\n\u201cRacial identity can be the basis of resistance to racism; but\neven as we struggle against racism\u2026let us not let our racial\nidentities subject us to new tyrannies\u201d (1996, 104). This\nresidual ambivalence, to recall the metaphysical discussions of the\nlast section, perhaps ground Mallon\u2019s contention that Appiah\nremains an eliminativist rather than a racial\nconstructivist, since ideally Appiah would prefer to be free of\nall residual constraints entailed by even socially constructed\nraces.\n\nTommie Shelby responds to the ambivalence of Appiah and Blum by\ndistinguishing classical black nationalism, which rested upon\nan organic black identity, with pragmatic black nationalism,\nbased on an instrumental concern with combating antiblack racism\n(2005, 38\u201352; 2003, 666\u2013668). Pragmatic nationalism allows\nBlack people to generate solidarity across class or cultural lines,\nnot just through the modus vivendi of shared interests but\nupon a principled commitment to racial equality and justice (2005,\n150\u2013154). As a result, black solidarity is grounded upon a\nprincipled response to common oppression, rather than some putative\nshared identity (2002), thus mitigating the dangers of biological\nessentialism and tyrannical cultural conformity that Appiah associates\nwith race and racial identities. Anna Stubblefield (2005) provides an\nalternative defense of Black solidarity by comparing it to familial\ncommitments.\n\nShelby (2005, 7) briefly mentions that his pragmatic, political\nversion of black solidarity is compatible with John Rawls\u2019s\nPolitical Liberalism, but his more detailed defense of the\nideal social contract method of Rawls\u2019s A Theory of\nJustice for theorizing racial justice has drawn substantial\ncontroversy (Shelby 2004). Elizabeth Anderson eschews ideal theory for\nanalyzing racial justice because it assumes motivational and cognitive\ncapacities beyond those of ordinary humans; it risks promoting ideal\nnorms (like colorblindness) under unjust conditions that require\nrace-specific policies; and its idealizing assumptions, like an\noriginal position in which parties do not know relevant personal and\nsocial racial facts, precludes recognition of historical and present\nracial injustice. She instead uses a normative framework of democratic\nequality to ground her moral imperative of integration.\n\nCharles Mills, extending his critique of how early modern social\ncontract thinking obfuscates racial injustice (1997), fears that\nRawls\u2019s ideal theory can similarly serve as an ideology that\nwhitewashes non-white oppression (Mills 2013). But rather than\njettisoning a contractarian approach entirely, Mills instead develops\na model of a non-ideal contract, in which the parties do not know\ntheir own racial identities but are aware of their society\u2019s\nhistory of racial exploitation and its effects. Because the parties\nknow of racial hierarchy but do not know if they will be its\nbeneficiaries or victims, Mills hypothesizes that they will rationally\nagree to racial reparations as a form of corrective or rectificatory\njustice (Pateman and Mills 2007, Chapters 3, 4, 8).\n\nShelby responds that, while Rawls\u2019s ideal theory of justice\nexcludes a theory of rectification because it is not comprehensive,\nrectificatory justice is not only complementary but in fact\npresupposes an ideal theory that can clarify when injustices have\noccurred and need to be rectified. More importantly, Shelby suggests\nthat complying with rectificatory justice through racial reparations\ncould well leave Black people living in a society that nevertheless\nremains racially unjust in other ways. For this reason, Shelby\nconcludes that ideal theory remains indispensable (2013).\n\nChristopher Lebron (2013, 28\u201342) also suggests that the\napproaches of Rawls and Mills are complementary, but in a very\ndifferent way. He argues that Rawls\u2019s focus on the basic\nstructure of society provides explanatory mechanisms through which\nwhite supremacy persists, something unspecified in earlier work by\nMills (2003). And in sharp contrast to Shelby (2013), Lebron\ncriticizes Mills for rehabilitating Rawlsian contract thinking, since\neven a non-ideal form eliminates the epistemological advantage of a\nnon-white perspective on white supremacy. Instead of reformulating\ncontractarian thinking to fit the needs of racial justice, Lebron\ninstead focuses on analyzing how \u201chistorically evolved\npower\u201d and \u201csocially embedded power\u201d perpetuate\nracial injustice.\n\nTurning to the second strand of practical philosophy devoted to race,\nvarious scholars have addressed policies such as affirmative action,\nrace-conscious electoral districting, and colorblindness in policy and\nlaw. The literature on affirmative action is immense, and may be\ndivided into approaches that focus on compensatory justice,\ndistributive justice, critiques of the concept of merit, and diversity\nof perspective. Alan Goldman (1979) generally argues against\naffirmative action, since jobs or educational opportunities as a rule\nshould go to those most qualified. Only when a specific individual has\nbeen victimized by racial or other discrimination can the otherwise\nirrelevant factor of race be used as a compensatory measure to award a\nposition or a seat at a university. Ronald Fiscus (1992) rejects the\ncompensatory scheme in favor of a distributive justice argument. He\nclaims that absent the insidious and invidious effects of a racist\nsociety, success in achieving admissions to selective universities or\nattractive jobs would be randomly distributed across racial lines.\nThus, he concludes that distributive justice requires the racially\nproportional distribution of jobs and university seats. Of course,\nFiscus\u2019s argument displaces the role of merit in the awarding of\njobs or university admissions, but this point is addressed by Iris\nYoung (1990, Chapter 7), who argues that contemporary criteria of\nmerit, such as standardized testing and educational achievement, are\nbiased against disadvantaged racial and other groups, and rarely are\nfunctionally related to job performance or academic potential.\nFinally, Michel Rosenfeld (1991) turns away from substantive theories\nof justice in favor of a conception of justice as reversibility, a\nposition influenced by the \u201cDiscourse Ethics\u201d of\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas (1990), which defines justice not by the proper\nsubstantive awarding of goods but as the result of a fair discursive\nprocedure that includes all relevant viewpoints and is free of\ncoercive power relations. Thus, affirmative action is justified as an\nattempt to include racially diverse viewpoints. All of these positions\nare summarily discussed in a useful debate format in Cohen and Sterba\n(2003).\n\nThe issues of race-conscious electoral districting and descriptive\nracial representation have also garnered substantial attention.\nRace-conscious districting is the practice of drawing geographically\nbased electoral districts in which the majority of voters are Black.\nDescriptive racial representation holds that Black populations are\nbest represented by Black politicians. Iris Marion Young (1990,\n183\u2013191) provides a spirited defense of descriptive\nrepresentation for racial minorities, grounded in their experiences of\n\u201coppression, the institutional constraint on\nself-determination\u201d, and domination \u201cthe institutional\nconstraint on self-determination\u201d (1990, 37). Anne Phillips\n(1995) furthers this position, arguing that representatives who are\nmembers of minority racial groups can enhance legislative\ndeliberation. Melissa Williams (1998) also defends the deliberative\ncontribution of descriptive racial representation, but adds that\nminority constituents are more likely to trust minority\nrepresentatives, since both will be affected by laws that overtly or\ncovertly discriminate against minority racial groups. Finally, Jane\nMansbridge (1999) carefully demonstrates why a critical mass of\nminority representatives is needed, in order to adequately advocate\nfor common minority interests as well as to convey the internal\ndiversity within the group. In a later work, Young (2000) addresses\ncritics who argue that descriptive representation relies upon group\nessentialism, since members of a racial group need not all share the\nsame interests or opinions. In response, Young suggests that members\nof the same racial group do share the same \u201csocial\nperspective\u201d grounded in common experiences, similar to the\ninteractive kind variant of racial constructivism\ndiscussed earlier. But because it is unclear that Black individuals\nare more likely to share common experiences than common interests or\nopinions, Michael James prioritizes using race-conscious districting\nto create Black racial constituencies which can hold Black or\nnon-Black representatives accountable to Black interests (James 2011).\nAbigail Thernstrom (1987) condemns race-conscious districting for\nviolating the original principles behind the 1965 Voting Rights Act\nand the 15th Amendment, by promoting the election of black\nrepresentatives rather than simply guaranteeing black voters the right\nto cast ballots. J. Morgan Kousser (1999) responds that race-conscious\ndistricting simply reflects the right to cast a\n\u201cmeaningful\u201d vote, as implied by the 15th\nAmendment protection against not only the denial but also the\n\u201cabridgment\u201d of the right to vote. Lani Guinier (1994)\ncompellingly suggests that instead of drawing majority black\ndistricts, we should adopt more proportional electoral system that\nfacilitate the electoral strength of racial and other minorities.\nMichael James (2004) suggests that alternative electoral systems\nfacilitate not only descriptive racial representation but also\ndemocratic deliberation across racial lines.\n\nA general advantage of using alternative electoral systems to enhance\nminority racial representation is that they are technically\ncolorblind, not requiring lawmakers or judges to group citizens\naccording to their racial identities. The general value of\ncolorblindness is an ongoing topic of debate within legal philosophy.\nDrawing on Justice John Marshall Harlan\u2019s famous dissent in\nPlessy v. Ferguson, and a not-uncontroversial interpretation\nof the origins of the equal protection clause, Andrew Kull (1992)\nargues that contemporary American statutory and constitutional law\nshould strive to be colorblind and combat racial inequality without\ndividing citizens into different racial groups. Ian Haney Lopez (2006,\n143\u2013162), on the other hand, fears \u201ccolorblind white\ndominance,\u201d whereby facially race-neutral laws leave untouched\nthe race-based inequality that operates within American political,\nlegal, and economic structures. Elizabeth Anderson (2010) provides a\ntrenchant critique of colorblindness as a normative standard for law,\npolicy, or ethics. Racial segregation and the potential for\nintegration have garnered much less philosophical attention than\naffirmative action and racially descriptive representation. Bernard\nBoxill (1992) offers a treatment of busing and self-segregation, while\nHoward McGary (1999) offers a clarification of integration and\nseparation. Iris Young (2002, chapter 6) treats residential\nsegregation in the context of regional democracy, while Owen Fiss\n(2003) analyzes it in the context of the legacy of racism. Anderson\nherself (2010) argues for the moral imperative of integration, with\nTommie Shelby (2014) and Ronald Sundstrom (2013) offering critical\nresponses to Anderson\u2019s argument. More recently, Andrew Valls\n(2018, chapter 6) has written on the subject.\n\nIn recent years, the problem of racism within policing and criminal\njustice in the United States has attracted intense popular and\nscholarly attention. Mathias Risse and Richard Zeckhauser (2004) offer\na qualified defense of racial profiling that engages both utilitarian\nand non-consequentialist reasoning. Annabelle Lever\u2019s (2005)\nobjection and response prompted a subsequent round of debate (Risse\n2007, Lever 2007). Michelle Alexander (2010) famously depicted the\ncontemporary American criminal justice system as the \u201cNew Jim\nCrow,\u201d for its intense racial disparities. Naomi Zack (2015)\nprovides a trenchant critique of racial profiling and police homicide.\nDavid Boonin (2011), on the other hand, reluctantly defends racial\nprofiling on pragmatic grounds. Finally, Adam Hosein (2018) argues\nagainst it for reasons of political equality. Shelby (2016) offers a\njustification of Black resistance based in the unjust legacy of racial\nsegregation while deepening his earlier critique of Anderson\u2019s\nview.\n",
