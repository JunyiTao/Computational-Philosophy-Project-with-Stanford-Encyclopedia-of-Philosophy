    "main_text": "Formulating Full Rule-consequentialism || Complete Acceptance versus Incomplete Acceptance\n6.3 Complete Acceptance versus Incomplete Acceptance\n\nWhile rule-consequentialist cost/benefit analyses of codes should\ncount the cost of getting those codes internalised by new generations,\nsuch analyses should acknowledge that the internalisation will not be\nachieved in every last person (D. Miller 2021: 130). No matter how\ngood the teaching is, the results will be imperfect. Some people will\nlearn rules that differ to some degree from the ones that were taught,\nand some of these people will end up with very mistaken views about\nwhat is morally required, morally optional, or morally wrong. Other\npeople will end up with insufficient moral motivation. Other people\nwill end up with no moral motivation at all (psychopaths).\nRule-consequentialism needs to have rules for coping with the\ninevitably imperfect results of moral teaching.\n\nSuch rules will crucially include rules about punishment. From a\nrule-consequentialist point of view, one point of punishment is to\ndeter certain kinds of act. Another point of punishment is to get\nundeterred, dangerous people off the streets. Perhaps\nrule-consequentialism can admit that another point of punishment is to\nappease the primitive lust for revenge on the part of victims of such\nacts and their family and friends. Finally, there is the expressive\nand reinforcing power of rules about punishment.\n\nSome ways of formulating rule-consequentialism make having rules about\npunishment difficult to explain. One such way of formulating\nrule-consequentialism is:\n\nAn act is morally wrong if and only if it is prohibited by the code of\nrules the full acceptance of which by absolutely everyone would\nproduce the greatest expected good.\n\n\nImagine a world in which absolutely every adult human fully accepts\nrules forbidding (for example) physical attacks on the innocent,\nstealing, promise breaking, and lying. Suppose these rules have been\ninternalized so deeply by everyone in this world that in this world\nthere is complete compliance with these rules. Also assume that, if\neveryone in this world always complies with these rules, this perfect\ncompliance becomes common knowledge. In this world, there would be\nlittle or no need for rules about punishment and thus little or no\nbenefit from having such rules. But there are teaching and\ninternalization costs associated with each rule taught and\ninternalized. So there are teaching and internalization costs\nassociated with the inclusion of any rule about punishment. The\ncombination of costs without benefits is repellant. Therefore, for a\nworld of complete compliance, the version of rule-consequentialism\nimmediately above would not endorse rules about punishment.\n\nWe need a form of rule-consequentialism that includes rules for\ndealing with people who are not committed to the right rules, indeed\neven for people who are irredeemable. In other words,\nrule-consequentialism needs to be formulated so as to conceptualize\nsociety as containing some people insufficiently committed to the\nright rules, and even some people not committed to any moral rules.\nHere is a way of doing so:\n\nAn act is wrong if and only if it is prohibited by a code of rules the\nacceptance of which by the overwhelming majority of people in each new\ngeneration would have the greatest expected value.\n\n\nNote that rule-consequentialism neither endorses nor condones the\nnon-acceptance of the code by those outside the overwhelming majority.\nOn the contrary, rule-consequentialism claims those people are morally\nmistaken. Indeed, the whole point of formulating rule-consequentialism\nthis way is to make room for rules about how to respond negatively to\nsuch people.\n\nOf course, the term \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d is very\nimprecise. Suppose we remove the imprecision by picking a precise\npercentage of society, say 90%. Picking any precise percentage as an\nobvious element of arbitrariness to it. For example, if we pick 90%,\nwhy not 89% or 91%?\n\nPerhaps, we can argue for a number in the range of 90% as a reasonable\ncompromise between two pressures. On the one hand, the percentage we\npick should be close enough to 100% to retain the idea that, ideally,\nmoral rules would be accepted by everyone. On the other hand, the\npercentage needs to be far enough short of 100% to leave considerable\nscope for rules about punishment. It seems that 90% is in a defensible\nrange, given the need to balance those considerations. (For dissent\nfrom this, see Ridge 2006; for a reply to Ridge, see Hooker and\nFletcher 2008. The matter receives further discussion in H. Smith\n2010; Tobia 2013, 2018; T. Miller 2014, 2021; Toppinen 2016; Portmore\n2017; Yeo 2017; Podgorski 2018; Perl 2021.)\n\nHolly Smith (2010) pointed out that a cost/benefit analysis of the\nacceptance of any particular code by a positive percentage of the\npopulation less than 100% depends on what the rest of the population\naccepts and is disposed to do. Consider the following contrast. One\nimagined scenario is that 90% of the population accept one code, and\nthe other 10% accept a very similar code, such that the two codes\nrarely diverge in practice. A second imagined scenario is that 90% of\nthe population accept one code, and the other 10% accept various codes\nthat frequently and dramatically conflict in practice with code\naccepted by 90%. Conflict resolution and enforcement are less\nimportant in the first imagined scenario than in the second. Hence, if\nrule-consequentialism is formulated in terms of the acceptance of a\ncode by less than 100% of people, it matters what assumptions are made\nabout whatever percentage of the population do not accept this\ncode.\n\nSome theorists propose that formulating rule-consequentialism in terms\nof the code the teaching of which has the greatest expected value is\nsuperior to formulating the theory in terms of either a fixed or\nvariable acceptance rate for codes (Mulgan 2006, 141, 147; 2017, 291;\n2020, 12\u201321; T. Miller 2016; 2021; D. Miller 2021). A\n\u201cteaching formulation\u201d of rule-consequentialism holds:\n\nAn act is morally prohibited, obligatory, or optional if and only if\nand because it is prohibited, obligatory, or permitted by the code of\nrules the teaching of which to everyone has at least as much expected\nvalue as the teaching of any other code.\n\nTwo clarifications are needed immediately. First,\n\u201ceveryone\u201d here needs to be qualified so as not to include\npeople \u201cwith significant, cognitive, or conative deficits\u201d\n(D. Miller 2021: 10). Second, teaching a code to everyone is not\nassumed to lead to everyone\u2019s internalization of this code.\nHence, even if everyone is taught a certain code, foreseeably there\nwill be some who internalize rules that are more or less different\nfrom the rules that were taught. There will also be some whose moral\nmotivation is unreliable or even indiscernible. And there will be some\nwho take themselves to be sceptics about moral rules and even about\nthe rest of morality.\n\nThere are some definite advantages of teaching formulations of\nrule-consequentialism. To be sure, we have to build into our\ncost/benefit analysis that enough costs are incurred to make the\nteaching at least partly successful. In other words, we must insist\nthat the teaching be successful enough to get enough people to\ninternalize rules such that a good degree of cooperation and security\nresults. But we do not need to be precise about what percentage of\npeople taught this code remain amoralists, what percentage of people\ntaught this code end up internalizing codes somewhat different from\nthe one being taught, or what percentage end up insufficiently\nmotivated to comply with the moral code they have internalized unless\neffective enforcement is in place (D. Miller 2021; T. Miller\n2021).\n\nAnother advantage of teaching formulations is that the idea of\nteaching a code to everyone connects tightly to the idea that this\ncode should be public knowledge. The idea that a moral code must be\nsuitable for being public knowledge is very appealing (Baier 1958:\n195\u2013196; Rawls 1971: 133; Gert 1998: 10\u201313, 225,\n239\u2013240; Hill 2005; Cureton 2015; Pettit 2017: 39, 65, 102). And\nrule-consequentialists have championed the idea that moral rules are\nsubject to this \u201cpublicity condition\u201d (Brandt 1992: 136,\n144; Hooker 2010; 2016, forthcoming; Parfit 2011, 2017a; D. Miller\n2021: 131\u201332).\n",
