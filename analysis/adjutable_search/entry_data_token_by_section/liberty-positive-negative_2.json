    "main_text": "Two Attempts to Create a Third Way\n3. Two Attempts to Create a Third Way\n\nCritics, however, have objected that the ideal described by Humboldt\nand Mill looks much more like a positive concept of liberty than a\nnegative one. Positive liberty consists, they say, in exactly this\ngrowth of the individual: the free individual is one that develops,\ndetermines and changes her own desires and interests autonomously and\nfrom within. This is not liberty as the mere absence of obstacles, but\nliberty as autonomy or self-realization. Why should the mere absence\nof state interference be thought to guarantee such growth? Is there\nnot some third way between the extremes of totalitarianism and the\nminimal state of the classical liberals \u2014 some non-paternalist,\nnon-authoritarian means by which positive liberty in the above sense\ncan be actively promoted?\n",
