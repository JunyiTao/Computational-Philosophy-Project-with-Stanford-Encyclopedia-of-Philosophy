    "main_text": "Contemporary Eliminative Materialism || Folk Psychology and the Theory-Theory\n2.1 Folk Psychology and the Theory-Theory\n\nThe standard argument for eliminative materialism begins with the\nSellarsian thesis that we employ a theoretical framework to explain\nand predict intelligent behavior. Because this position claims that we\nuse a theory when employing mental idiom, it is often referred to as\nthe \u201ctheory-theory\u201d (see the entry on\n folk psychology as a theory),\n and is endorsed not only by eliminative materialists, but by many\nrealists about mental states as well (like Sellars). Folk psychology\nis assumed to consist of both generalizations (or laws) and specific\ntheoretical posits, denoted by our everyday psychological terms like\n\u2018belief\u2019 or \u2018pain\u2019. The generalizations are\nassumed to describe the various causal or counterfactual relations and\nregularities of the posits. For instance, a typical example of a folk\npsychological generalization would be:\n\nIf someone has the desire for X and the belief that the best\nway to get X is by doing Y, then (barring certain\nconditions) that person will tend to do Y.\n\n\nAdvocates of the theory-theory claim that generalizations like these\nfunction in folk psychology much like the laws and generalizations of\nscientific theories. At the same time, many theory-theorists allow\nthat the laws of folk psychology are learned more informally than\nscientific theories, as part of our normal development (see, for\nexample, P. M. Churchland, 1981 and Lewis, 1972).\n\nAccording to theory-theorists, the posits of folk psychology are\nsimply the mental states that figure in our everyday psychological\nexplanations. Theory-theorists maintain the (controversial) position\nthat, as theoretical posits, these states are not directly observed,\nthough they are thought to account for observable effects like overt\nbehavior. Theory-theorists also claim that common-sense assigns a\nnumber of properties to these states, such as causal, semantic and\nqualitative features. For instance, the theory-theory claims\ncommon-sense assigns two sorts of properties to beliefs. First, there\nare various causal properties. Beliefs are the sort of states that are\ncaused in certain specific circumstances, interact with other\ncognitive states in various ways, and come to generate various sorts\nof behavior, depending on the agent\u2019s other desires and mental\nstates. As functionalists have claimed, these causal roles appear to\ndefine our ordinary notion of belief and distinguish them from other\ntypes of mental states. Second, beliefs have\n intentionality;\n that is, they each express a proposition or are about a particular\nstate of affairs. This inherent intentionality (also called\n\u201cmeaning\u201d, \u201ccontent\u201d, and \u201csemantic\ncharacter\u201d), is commonly regarded as something special about\nbeliefs and other propositional attitudes. Moreover, as we will see\nbelow, it is also a popular target of eliminative materialists who\nchallenge the propriety and explanatory value of beliefs.\n\nAlthough eliminative materialists have traditionally appealed to\nsomething like the idea that our folk conception of the mind is a\ntheory, as suggested by the theory-theory, it does not actually \nrequire  that our commonsense mental notions are embedded in a\ntheoretical framework used for explaining and predicting. Virtually\nany sort of embedding conceptual framework could be proposed in\nsupport of the first step of the eliminativist argument. In fact,\nalthough it is seldom recognized, the only thing eliminative\nmaterialism actually requires is the relatively weak assumption that\nwe have mental concepts (i.e., concepts of mental states and\nprocesses) and that those concepts assign certain properties to those\nmental states and processes. Even opponents of the theory-theory will\ntypically allow that we possess  some  sort of conception of\nmental states like beliefs or pains and that such a conception (at\nleast tacitly) assigns to their corresponding mental entities a\nvariety of intrinsic, relational, intentional, phenomenal, causal, and\ntemporal properties. Anyone who denies this would be denying that we\npossess notions of mental states \u2013 a highly implausible\nview.\n",
