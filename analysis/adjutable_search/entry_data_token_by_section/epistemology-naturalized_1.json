    "main_text": "General Orientation || Some key features of TE\n1.1 Some key features of TE\n\nDescartes\u2019 avowed goal was to \u201cstart again right from the\nfoundations\u201d (First Meditation, 1988 [1641]: 17) of\nscience\u2014i.e., to legitimate the foundations of inquiry per\nse, and to show how we ought to conduct ourselves intellectually\nin order to achieve knowledge and avoid error. The realization of the\npossibility of massive error\u2014made vivid through the device of\ncertain skeptical possibilities\u2014of course had a significant\ninfluence over Descartes\u2019 theorizing. His specific\nrecommendation, arrived at through careful reflection on his own\nideas, was a particularly strong foundationalism designed to rule out\nthe possibility of error: one should \u201chold back [one\u2019s]\nassent from opinions which are not completely certain and\nindubitable\u201d (ibid.), and in fact treat as false\nanything that could possibly be false. On the other hand, Descartes\nsays, \u201cI\u2026seem to be able to lay it down as a general rule\nthat whatever I perceive very clearly and distinctly is true\u201d\n(ibid.: 87). So long as one carefully apportions one\u2019s\njudgment to the degree of \u201cclarity and distinctness\u201d of\none\u2019s ideas, given God\u2019s providence, one can proceed in\nconfidence that one is not theorizing in error.\n\nVery few current practitioners of TE endorse Descartes\u2019\narguments and positive views. Very few, for example, accept his\ninfallibilism about what knowledge requires, and many regard\nDescartes\u2019 arguments as manifesting an unfortunate circularity.\nNonetheless, Descartes\u2019 work exemplifies certain assumptions\nabout the epistemological enterprise that many epistemologists have\nretained, even if only implicitly, and that have come to be closely\nassociated with TE. Taking our cue from Crumley (2009: 185; Goldman\n1986: 1\u20132, and Pacherie 2002: 300\u2013301, make similar\nsuggestions), we can identify the most salient such assumptions as\nfollows:\n\n(a)\nMuch of traditional theorizing about central epistemic notions,\nsuch as knowledge, justification, evidence, and so on, has been\ncarried out\na priori: careful reflection, rather than\nempirical investigation, is taken to be the proper method to arrive at\nan accurate understanding of the true epistemological principles and\nfacts.\n(b)\nSecond, and relatedly, is a view of epistemology as\nautonomous: in terms of both its methods and its\nsubject matter, epistemology is independent of the sciences. Hence,\nfor example, there\u2019s nothing the sciences can tell us that will,\nor could, inform our answers to the distinctively philosophical\nquestions epistemologists ask (\u201cwhat is knowledge?\u201d,\n\u201cis knowledge even possible?\u201d, etc.). On the contrary, if\nanything, it is epistemology that\u2019s prior to the\nsciences\u2014advances in the former can aid and constrain the\nlatter, but not vice versa.\n(c)\nThird\u2014and again, relatedly\u2014a distinctive feature of\ntraditional epistemology is said to be its concern with\nnormative matters. By this, it is usually meant at\nleast that epistemological facts\u2014whether a belief is justified\nor rational, e.g.\u2014are evaluative, and not purely\ndescriptive: to say that a belief is justified, for example,\nis to say that from an epistemic point of view it is good, correct, or\npermissible, to hold it.\n(Compare Chisholm\u2019s (1977) calling \u201cjustified\u201d a\n\u201cterm of epistemic appraisal\u201d.) Many proponents of TE\nregard epistemology as being normative in respect of being\nprescriptive as well\u2014i.e., of telling us how we\nshould form our beliefs, and so on. This connects with the\nidea, popular within TE, that epistemology is in the business of\noffering useful advice, and so as having \u201can important\nmeliorative dimension\u201d (Kitcher 1992: 64; cf. Wrenn 2006:\n60).\n\n\nTo Crumley\u2019s list, we might, given its historical importance,\nadd the following:\n\n(d)\nWhile there is hardly agreement about how best to do so, among the\ncentral tasks of epistemology as traditionally practiced has been to\narticulate a plausible response\nto skepticism\u2014i.e., to defend the ordinary\ncommitment that we have, or are reasonable in taking ourselves to\nhave, a wide range of justified beliefs and/or a decent stock of\nknowledge.\n\n\n(a)\u2013(d), again, are some of the central features of TE, as it is\nusually understood. Obviously, there are natural connections among\nthem. For instance, to the extent that the autonomy of epistemology\n (b)\n is thought to amount to its priority\u2014insofar as it\napproaches the status of \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d, in the manner\nDescartes supposed\u2014a concern with\n (d)\n will be natural, even obligatory. So too, one might think that the\nautonomy of epistemology\n (b)\n is owing to its (partly) normative subject matter\n (c),\n and/or its distinctive methodology\n (a),\n as compared with the (purportedly) purely descriptive concerns and a\nposteriori methods of science. And so on. However, the theories\nfalling within TE are, once again, a varied lot; and those sympathetic\nto TE at times pull these features apart, emphasizing commitment to\nthem to varying degrees and in different ways.\n",
