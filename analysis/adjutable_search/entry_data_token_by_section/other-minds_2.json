    "main_text": "The (Traditional) Epistemological Problem || Best Explanation\n1.2 Best Explanation\n\nThe argument from best explanation has been advocated as an advance on\nthe argument from analogy. While Hyslop insists that any justification\nfor one\u2019s belief in other minds must make crucial reference to\none\u2019s own case, it has been argued that not needing to\nrely on such reference makes the argument from best explanation\npreferable as an account of how we justify our belief here (Pargetter\n1984). Whether or not one pauses to assess the relative merits of\nthese two ways of defending the rationality of our belief in other\nminds, what is undoubtedly the case is that the argument from best\nexplanation is\u2014either explicitly or implicitly\u2014a form of\nargument that enjoys wide acceptance today. David Chalmers, for\nexample, writes, \u201cIt \u2026 seems that this [argument from\nbest explanation] is as good a solution to the problem of other minds\nas we are going to get\u201d (1996: 246).\n\nWhile the argument from analogy was once popular in science (Hyslop\n& Jackson (1972) cite the example of the discovery of helium on\nthe sun to have a characteristic spectrum by analogy with the\ncharacteristic spectrum of helium on earth) in more recent times\nscience has tended to proceed in accordance with the principle that it\nis rational to believe that hypothesis that provides the best\navailable explanation of a particular phenomenon at a given time. This\nstyle of argument is sometimes referred to as abduction, and it is\nplaced alongside deduction and enumerative induction as another form\nof inferential reasoning. While simple enumerative inductive takes one\nfrom certain observations to the conclusion that one can expect more\nof the same, abduction allows for the introduction of entities that\nare not just unobserved, but that are unobservable (Lipton 2000;\nHarman 1965).\n\nIt is claimed that my reason for believing that others have minds\nsimilar to my own can be taken to be the same as the scientific\nrealist\u2019s reason for believing in the existence of electrons or\nother theoretical entities. On this way of thinking, mental states are\ntaken to be inner states of an individual that provide the best\nexplanation of the behavior we observe in others; any other\nexplanation would be implausible. Pargetter (1984) considers the\nfollowing as implausible alternative hypotheses: (i) God is working\nothers like puppets; (ii) I am unique in having mental states as the\ncause of behavior; and (iii) that others have mental states but they\nare of an entirely different nature to my own.\n\nAccording to Pargetter, the argument from best explanation is able to\nbypass all criticisms standardly brought to bear against the argument\nfrom analogy, as it relies solely on the explanatory power of the\nproposed hypothesis\u2014in this case, that others have minds. This\nform of reasoning is also held to be superior to reasoning from\nanalogy as it can be used to establish the existence of minds in\nindividuals of other species whose behavior may not be similar to mine\nor who think and feel in ways that are dissimilar to the way\nthat I think and feel. It may also be used to justify the belief in\nminds of (abnormal) humans who may either behave very differently or\nthink and feel very differently from their conspecifics.\n\nMelnyk (1994) has argued that there is an important disanalogy between\nthe scientific realist\u2019s reason for believing in theoretical\nentities and an ordinary person\u2019s reason for believing that\nother people have minds. His argument rests on the observation that\ngross behavioral evidence is insufficient for belief in another mind\nwithout additional reference to what one knows from one\u2019s own\ncase. Melnyk can be read as advocating a hybrid account of our\nknowledge here, incorporating elements from the argument from analogy\nas a supplement to the inference from best explanation. But he also\nmakes the following, important, observation: \u201cA complete\nresponse to the problem of other minds seems obliged to incorporate\nmore than one approach, and may have to incorporate several\u201d\n(1994: 487). This is an observation others have also begun to advocate\n(see\n \u00a73.2).\n",
