    "main_text": "Newtonian Absolute Space in the Twentieth Century || Substantivalism\n5.2 Substantivalism\n\nPut another way, one can define the predicate x accelerates\nas trajectory(x)\nhas-non-zero-rate-of-change-from-straightness, where\ntrajectory maps bodies onto their trajectories in Galilean\nspacetime. And this predicate, defined this way, applies to the water\nin Newton\u2019s bucket if and only if it is rotating, according to\nNewtonian mechanics formulated in terms of the geometry of Galilean\nspacetime; it is the mechanically relevant sense of\naccelerate in this theory. But this theoretical formulation\nand definition have been given in terms of the geometry of spacetime,\nnot in terms of the relations between bodies; acceleration is\n\u2018absolute\u2019 in the sense that there is a preferred (true)\nsense of acceleration in mechanics and which is not defined in terms\nof the motions of bodies relative to one another. Note that this sense\nof \u2018absolute\u2019 is broader than that of motion relative to\nabsolute space, which we defined earlier. In the remainder of this\narticle we will use it in this new broader sense. The reader should be\naware that the term is used in many ways in the literature, and such\nequivocation often leads to significant misunderstanding.\n\nIf any of this analysis of motion is taken literally then one arrives\nat a position regarding the ontology of spacetime rather like that of\nNewton\u2019s regarding space: it is some kind of\n\u2018substantial\u2019 (or maybe pseudo-substantial) thing\nwith the geometry of Galilean spacetime, just as absolute space\npossessed Euclidean geometry. This view regarding the ontology of\nspacetime is usually called \u2018substantivalism\u2019 (Sklar,\n1974). The Galilean substantivalist usually sees themselves as\nadopting a more sophisticated geometry than Newton but sharing his\nsubstantivalism (though there is plenty of room for debate on\nNewton\u2019s exact ontological views; see DiSalle, 2002, and Slowik\n2016). The advantage of the more sophisticated geometry is that\nalthough it allows the absolute sense of acceleration apparently\nrequired by Newtonian mechanics to be defined, it does not allow one\nto define a similar absolute speed or velocity \u2013 x\naccelerates can be defined as a 1-place predicate in terms of\nthe geometry of Galilean spacetime, but not x moves in\ngeneral \u2013 and so the first of Leibniz\u2019s problems is\nresolved. Of course we see that the solution depends on a crucial\nshift from speed and velocity to acceleration as the relevant senses\nof \u2018motion\u2019: from the rate of change of position to the\nrate of rate of change.\n\nWhile this proposal solves the first kind of problem posed by Leibniz,\nit seems just as vulnerable to the second. While it is true that it\ninvolves the rejection of absolute space as Newton conceived it, and\nwith it the need to explicate the nature of an enduring space, the\npostulation of Galilean spacetime poses the parallel question of the\nnature of spacetime. Again, it is a physical but non-material\nsomething, the points of which may be coincident with material bodies.\nWhat kind of thing is it? Could we do without it? As we shall see\nbelow, some contemporary philosophers believe so.\n",
