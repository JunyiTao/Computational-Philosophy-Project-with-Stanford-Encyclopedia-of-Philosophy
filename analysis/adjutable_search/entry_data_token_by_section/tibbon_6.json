    "main_text": "Philosophy and Exegesis\n7. Examples of Philosophical Exegesis\n\n\nThroughout Ibn Tibbon\u2019s writings, he returns time and again to a\nfew key problems: divine providence, the possibility of immortality,\nand the final aim of human existence. These subjects were particularly\nvexing: Maimonides had discussed them, but did not provide a consistent\ndoctrine; al-Farabi had famously denied that conjunction is possible;\nwhile Averroes took up the question of immortality in several works\nwith differing results. Ibn Tibbon, for his part, worked with the\nbiblical texts singled out by Maimonides, but developed ideas drawn\nfrom al-Farabi and Averroes. His discussion of three biblical texts,\nall relating to the final aim of human existence, are especially\nimportant. His interpretations will be presented here in relation to\nthose of Maimonides.\n\n\n1. Genesis 28:12\u201313\n\n\nAnd he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top\nof it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and\ndescending on it; and behold, the Lord stood above it, and said: I am\nthe God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. \n\n\nIn the preface to the Guide of the Perplexed, Maimonides\nsingles out Jacob\u2019s vision of the ladder in Gen 28 as a paradigmatic\nexample of the biblical allegory; he isolates seven key terms in the\nstory, which he decodes, in two different ways, in later chapters of\nthe Guide. Thus the angels ascending and descending the\nladder are explained in Guide 1:15 as prophets; they ascend\nthrough study and descend, with divine wisdom in hand, to govern the\npeople. In Guide 2:10, in contrast, the vision is explained\nin relation to cosmology rather than politics and prophecy. The ladder\nis set up on the earth and extends into the celestial realm, the rungs\non the ladder are the four elements or seven celestial bodies, and the\nangels ascending and descending are the celestial intelligences. The\nLord, standing firmly at the top of the ladder, is God as first cause\nor prime mover.\n\n\nIbn Tibbon was the first philosopher-exegete to build upon Maimonides\u2019\napproach and to move it in new directions, which were more consistent\nwith his own particular interests. Thus in Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim, chapter 11, he emphasized the epistemological and\ncosmological and eliminated the political.  According to his\ninterpretation, the angels ascending are the philosophers, who ascend\nthe ladder of wisdom toward metaphysics, the final subject of the\ncurriculum. Who then are the angels that descend?  They are not the\nprophets, descending with wisdom to rule the people, but separate\nintelligences, which descend to help the human intellect reach its\nfinal perfection: knowledge of and conjunction with God.\n\n2. Jeremiah 9:22\u201323\n\n\nThus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither\nlet the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in\nhis riches; But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he\nunderstandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise\nlovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in\nthese things I delight, saith the Lord.\n\n\nIn Guide 3:54, Maimonides presents a brief discussion of the\npurpose of human existence. Building upon Aristotelian treatments of\nthis problem, he presents four possible human ends: perfection in\nwealth, health, ethics, and intellect. He then introduces a biblical\ntext, Jeremiah 9:22\u201323, which he says presents the same ideas of the\nphilosophers, but with one important addition. Namely, like the\nphilosophers, Jeremiah also singles out four possible\nperfections\u2014\u201cmight,\u201d \u201criches,\u201d ethical\n\u201cwisdom,\u201d and \u201cunderstanding and\nknowledge\u201d\u2014but he adds something more as well:\n\u201cexercising lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the\nearth.\u201d Thus knowledge of God, Maimonides seems to suggest,\nshould lead to action; the contemplative should serve a practical\nend.\n\n\nIn the preface to the translation of Maimonides on Avot, as well as in\nthe commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon discusses these same verses\nfrom Jeremiah in detail, explains and criticizes Maimonides\u2019\ninterpretation of them, then presents his own novel\nexplication. According to Ibn Tibbon, the final human perfection is\nknowledge and understanding of God, without qualification. Thus the\nverse should be understood differently, with the final clause relating\nto God rather than man; man should understand and know God, full\nstop.\n\n\n3. Song of Songs 5:2\n\nI sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that\nknocketh.\n\n\nIn Guide 3:51, Maimonides cites Song of Songs 5:2 in the\ncourse of his discussion of the patriarchs and Moses. These figures,\nhe says, reached the highest level of human perfection, for they were\nin constant communion with God and also fully involved in the creation\nand governance of a religious community. They were like the\nprotagonist of Song of Songs, with heart awake even while asleep.\n\n\nWhat was Ibn Tibbon\u2019s understanding of the same subject? How did he\nbuild on and respond to Maimonides\u2019 use of the verse? As in the\nprevious two examples, Ibn Tibbon cites and discusses Guide\n3:51, but suggests a different approach. As he explains in the\ncommentary on Ecclesiastes, the patriarchs and Moses did achieve this\nstate of philosophy and politics, precisely as Maimonides had\ndescribed it; they were asleep (in the world of matter) with heart\nawake (toward the world of God). But in Ibn Tibbon\u2019s opinion, although\nthis state is worthy of praise, they could have reached a higher state\nstill: they could have been completely awake, engaged in a life of\npure contemplation, free from the hindrances of the physical and\npolitical world.\n\n\nIn all three of these examples, Ibn Tibbon emphasizes the\ncontemplative over the practical. He works with the same biblical\ntexts singled out by Maimonides, but arrives at a different\nphilosophical position. It is precisely this interesting\nphilosophical-exegetical give and take, the free discussion of ideas\nwithin a fixed biblical framework, that characterized the Maimonidean\ntradition of philosophy and exegesis, which was founded by Ibn Tibbon\nand continued by his descendents, disciples, and admirers.\n",
