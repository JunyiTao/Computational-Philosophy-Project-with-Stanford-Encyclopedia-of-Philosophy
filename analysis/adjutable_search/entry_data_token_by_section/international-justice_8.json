    "main_text": "The New Cosmopolitanism and Beyond || Poverty and Causation\n4.2 Poverty and Causation\n\nThe pure egalitarian impulse begins with the idea that we have duties\nof justice towards one another that do not depend upon shared\ninstitutions. Thomas Pogge\u2019s recent work, in contrast, argues\nthat institutions are morally central\u2014but in a manner somewhat\nunlike that argued for by the left Rawlsians. (Pogge was, of course,\nan early advocate of left institutionalism, but his more recent work\ndoes not depend upon left institutionalism being true.) Pogge\u2019s\nrecent work (see, especially, 2002) has argued that the institutions\nwe have built in the world are, in fact, directly violating the rights\nof the poor. We can start our analysis here by noting the starkness of\nPogge\u2019s conclusion: global poverty represents, for Pogge, not\njust an unmet humanitarian obligation, but an ongoing human evil,\nperhaps the greatest one in history. Pogge\u2019s argument insists\nthat international poverty and underdevelopment\u2014and the death\nand wasted potential this entails\u2014find their causal origin in a\nset of global institutions created and imposed by the wealthy nations\nof the world upon the global poor (Pogge 2002, 2010a). As such, the\npoverty of the underdeveloped nations is not simply a fact in the\nworld, to be dealt with by comparatively weak moral notions of\nhumanitarian benefit and charity; it is, instead, a violation of the\nrights of the poor. It is not simply a violation of their legitimate\nexpectations; they might expect to be helped, for instance, and we are\nnot merely refraining from doing that. It is a violation of their\nnegative rights to be free from harm. The poorer inhabitants of the\nworld have rights that are being violated, on a massive scale, by the\nwealthy states. One significant mechanism for this violation is the\nascription of the resource and borrowing privilege to any organization\nable to take effective political control of a territorial\njurisdiction. A group does not have to truly represent the interests\nof a place\u2019s inhabitants, on the rules set up by international\nlaw, in order to sell that jurisdiction\u2019s resources. So long as\nan agent is able to effectively control and repress the inhabitants,\nit has the ability to speak in their name in international\ntreaty-making\u2014regardless of how badly it treats these\ninhabitants. The result, for Pogge, is that the institutions of global\nsociety have set up incentives by which undemocratic regimes are\nrewarded and encouraged in the underdeveloped countries, and in which\nresources predictably flow from these countries to those already\nblessed with wealth. The shared history of colonial rule, moreover,\nhas led to the radical underdevelopment experienced by many former\ncolonies, with the result that these colonies are likely to be\nexceptionally vulnerable to the decisions and acts of agents within\nformer colonial powers. Global institutions are, in the end, developed\nand maintained to benefit the wealthier nations that set these\ninstitutions up, and whose participation is necessary for their\nsurvival as institutions. They serve only to impose a set of property\nrules upon the poorer nations that guarantee their continued poverty\nand underdevelopment.\n\nPogge\u2019s analysis is powerful, and includes a number of valuable\npositive suggestions about how we might begin to rectify these\ndefects\u2014including revisions in how pharmaceutical research is\nincentivized, and mechanisms for a global tax on resource use (Pogge\n1994 and 2011). For the moment, though, we may examine only the major\ncritical responses to which Pogge\u2019s argument has been subjected.\nMost of Pogge\u2019s critics agree with his contention that\ninternational poverty is unjust, in addition to being a violation of\nhumanitarian duties. These critics, though, have frequently questioned\nwhether or not Pogge has made his case that this poverty is causally\nascribable to the international institutional set\u2014and that\nsimple revisions in this set could dramatically decrease global\npoverty.\n\nThe first form of critique begins with an objection to Pogge\u2019s\nidea that global institutions cause international poverty. The worry\nwith this idea begins with concerns about the idea that the notion of\na cause can be, without certain controversial assumptions, be easily\nascribed to anything as complex as the global institutional set. In\nparticular, for an institution to be said to have caused a result,\nthere must be a comprehensible baseline of expectations to which the\nexisting result might be compared. Alan Patten and Mathias Risse have\neach provided a version of this critique. Patten argues that Pogge\nillegitimately smuggles in a moralized baseline of expectations, in\nwhich the inhabitants of the poorer nations obtain the resources and\nrights they would have under ideal justice; this baseline is what the\npoor deserve, argues Patten, but it is a stretch to say that the\nwealthy nations cause the poverty of the poor when they fail to bring\nabout ideal justice (Patten 2005). Mathias Risse offers an even more\npointed criticism, pointing out that the usual baseline for causation\nto be ascribed to an interaction is the expectations that would hold\nin the absence of such interaction (Risse 2005). Risse points out that\nthe statistical baseline for most of humanity throughout history has\nbeen radical poverty and misery. On this analysis, the interaction\nbetween the poor and the rich might be taken to have increased the\nwealth of the poor, rather than caused their poverty. This is\ncompatible, of course, with the existence of duties of justice as\nregards the benefits of industrialization and globalization; the poor\nmay have become slightly better off, but the wealthy have undoubtedly\ngotten much, much richer, and we might develop theories that condemn\nthis gap. Pogge\u2019s contention that global poverty is caused by\nthe wealthy societies of the world, though, seems\u2014to Risse and\nPatten\u2014simply incorrect.\n Joshua Cohen offers a more wide-reaching version of these\nconcerns.  He, too, begins with the difficulty of saying that the\npoverty of the global poor is caused by the wealth of the global rich\n(Cohen 2011). He challenges, that is, the extent to which the global\ninstitutions imposed by the wealthy are actually causally\nresponsible. His analysis, though, draws more on modern development\neconomics, and notes that modern theorists have identified various\nfactors that might determine why some countries are poor and some are\nrich: they include the institutions described by Pogge, but they also\ninclude such endogenous factors as geography, resource allocation, and\npolitical culture (Easterly 2006).  The precise weighting and power of\nthese various factors is, of course, a matter of tremendous\ndisagreement and controversy, and much of the field of development\neconomics is devoted to developing more complete and powerful analyses\nof how the relative wealth and poverty of nations is to be\nexplained. This is a difficulty for Pogge, argues Cohen, since his\nanalysis of poverty includes only two possibilities: either the poor\nnations of the world are responsible for their own poverty, which is\nimplausible, or the rich nations of the world are responsible for that\npoverty. Cohen\u2019s conclusion is that Pogge has not adequately\ncome to terms with the empirical complexity of how poverty is to be\nexplained, and that as a result his conclusions about international\nculpability for poverty are simply unmotivated.\n\nThe debate between Pogge and his critics, of course, continues (see\nPogge 2010b); Pogge is able to offer rejoinders to many of the\nobjections discussed here. In particular, Pogge has emphasized\nrecently that the baseline with which his analysis proceeds is one of\na reasonable alternative set of arrangements that would not generate\nthis massive human rights deficit. Christian Barry and Gerhard\n\u00d8verland, moreover, have recently provided six distinct ways in\nwhich the global order might be thought to harm the poor, despite the\nconceptual worries of figures like Risse and Cohen (Barry &\n\u00d8verland, 2016). It is important to recognize, though, that\nmuch of this debate turns on a mixture of empirical social science and\npolitical philosophy. This is, we believe, likely to be a territory in\nwhich an increasing amount of work on global justice will have to be\nsituated in the years to come.\n",
