Why Do Comparative Philosophy If It\u2019s So Hard?\n\nThe most obvious sin of doing comparative philosophy is assimilating\nanother tradition to one\u2019s own by unreflectively importing\nassumptions, frameworks, and agendas into one\u2019s reading of that\nother tradition. Sometimes too much charity (as a principle of\ninterpretation) is insufficiently respectful of the distinctness of\nthe other tradition. There are more subtle dangers. If one is a\ndissident from main trends in one\u2019s home tradition, one is\ntempted to find another tradition that \u201cgot it right.\u201d\nThis is fine as long as the desire to find another such tradition does\nnot lead to distortion or oversimplification of that other tradition\n(see Hansen, 1992, 2004, for discussions of taking Confucianism as\nrepresentative of the Chinese tradition as a whole and of trying to\nfind in Confucianism something one may perceive as lacking in\none\u2019s own tradition). The result is a kind of\n\u201cOrientalism\u201d (Said 1978) that is turned on its head, so\nthat the radical other is now superior. \n\nAnother debate involving this sort of possibility was initiated by\nGoldin (2003) and later on taken up by Slingerland (2013), who have\ncriticized interpretations (e.g., in Ames, 1993; Jullien, 2007) that\ntake Chinese thought to be innocent of commitment to mind/body dualism\n(which is implicitly or explicitly deemed to be a fundamental error).\nThey present historical and textual evidence to argue that some sort\nof mind/body dualism operated within many if not all early Chinese\ntexts. Slingerland also backs up his conclusions with qualitative and\nquantitative analysis designed to guard against cherry-picking\npassages from texts guided by one\u2019s preconceptions of what is in\nthem. He uses keyword-focused random sampling of passages from the\npre-Qin corpus of received texts supplemented by recently discovered\narchaeological texts from Guodian. Goldin emphasizes that different\ntexts will reveal different views about the relationship of mind and\nbody, whereas Slingerland is inclined to think the texts tend to\nreveal belief in a \u201cweak dualism\u201d he believes to be a\nhuman universal. Weak dualism falls in between a strong dualism that\nposits an ontological distinction between mind and body, such as\nDescartes\u2019 claim that mind and body are distinct substances with\nnothing in common, on the one hand, and a strong \u201cholism\u201d\nthat asserts no qualitative differences between mind and body. Weak\ndualism holds that there are functional and qualitative differences\nbetween mind and body without asserting ontological distinction.\nSlingerland sometimes mentions \u201cweak holism\u201d as a possible\nfourth position, but its difference with weak dualism is unclear.\n\nRaphals (2015) does explicitly include the latter as a fourth position\nand seems to distinguish the two intermediate positions according to\nwhether they emphasize more or less the distinction between mind and\nbody, noting that there is no firm boundary between the two.\nMencius\u2019 conception of mind and body seems to fall somewhere in\nthis intermediate zone. He regards mind (xin) as an organ of\nthe body whose function is to think, and it has the four sprouts of\ngoodness. Thus there are functional and qualitative distinctions he\nmakes between mind and the (rest of the?) body, and the mind is\ncertainly functionally distinct, but it is consistent with what he\nsays to regard mind as composed of the same energy-stuff (qi)\nthat composes the body. Indeed, Chinese metaphysics later came to\ncommonly recognize qi as the universal stuff of the world. On\nthe other hand, as Goldin points out, no less a text than the\nZhuangzi provides passages that suggest the possibility of\ndisembodied minds, such as speculation that a dying friend might next\nturn up as a rat\u2019s liver or an insect\u2019s leg. Raphals\npoints out much of the interest and the variety of ways in which early\nChinese thought relates the mind to the body as lying not in the\ndualist/holist contrast but in the details, such as the body portrayed\nas the container of the mind, or the mind being ruler of the body.\nComparing ideas from Greek and Chinese texts, she finds that neither\ndualism nor holism is anyone\u2019s cultural property.\n\nThe dangers of reading into another tradition one\u2019s own peculiar\nassumptions on the one hand and on the other hand excessively\n\u201cothering\u201d it (even if in the service of saying they were\nright) are hard to avoid, or at least hard to avoid being accused of\nfalling prey to them. It is hard enough to master a single tradition\nto the point where one can avoid saying silly things about it. Are the\nrisks worth it?\n\nOne reason for thinking so is that comparative philosophy is an\ninstance of a sound and sensible strategy for doing philosophy. When\nfacing hard problems it is simply a good strategy to consider a wide\nrange of enduring, respected ideas bearing on those problems. We of\ncourse must be wary of the possibility that the other tradition is not\nreally addressing the same problem we are, or that it is addressing\nonly part of the problem we are addressing. But when there is common\naddress of a problem, it is not always the case that one tradition\nmust be adjudicated as entirely right and the other as entirely wrong.\nThere is a good possibility that each tradition has something\ninsightful to say about some aspect of the problem and that each\ntradition could incorporate something of what the other tradition has\nto say (see Yu and Bunnin, 2001). Yu (2007) appropriates\nAristotle\u2019s conception of the friend as a second self, a mirror,\nby which one can come to know oneself better, one\u2019s unexamined\npresuppositions, for instance. May Sim (2007) argues that\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysics of the soul supplies a substantial self\nthat is both needed and presupposed by Confucius\u2019 virtue ethics.\nAt the same time she argues that Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics tilts\ntoo far towards an individualism that does not motivate sufficient\nattention to the culturally laden social relations required by his own\nethics of character and politics of virtue, and so Aristotelian ethics\ncould benefit by taking from Confucianism an acknowledgment of the\nethical importance of ceremony and decorum. When one crosses\ntraditions in enacting such strategies, there is the opportunity for\nfruitful interaction and mutual influence. Already discussed above is\nthe opportunity for fruitful interaction between rights-oriented\ntraditions and traditions such as Confucianism focused on the value of\nrelationship and community.\n\nConsider another area of potential interaction: when a tradition as\nlong-lived and as sophisticated as the Confucian tradition brims full\nwith writing on the nature of agency, human motivation, and the\nproblem of developing ethical excellence and commitment, one cannot\nafford to ignore it (see Ivanhoe, 2000, for portraits of the tradition\nof Confucian and neo-Confucian thinkers on these subjects).\nConfucianism and Daoism emphasize the need to to pay attention to the\nconcrete details of the situation at hand and displays healthy\nskepticism about the power of general principle to reveal what sort of\naction is suitable to the situation. Confucianism displays an\nappreciation for the power of community, custom, convention and\nceremony for helping to make vivid and concrete and meaningful such\nethical abstractions as love, respect, and care (Fingarette, 1972,\nShun, 1993, Kupperman, 2004). From these themes, there is much to be\nlearned, especially if one\u2019s home tradition has had a strong\nfocus for a good portion of the modern period on the top-down\ndeduction of specific ethical judgments from extremely abstract\nprinciples. At the same time, an appreciation for the concrete and for\nthe culturally specific may obscure the possibility of general and\ntranscultural principles that help to evaluate the concrete and\nculturally specific, and the Chinese tradition could benefit from\ninteraction with the Western (Cua, 1985). In fact, one\u2019s case\nfor the existence of transcultural principles becomes stronger when\none dives into other tradition and finds correlates to important\nthemes in one\u2019s own tradition. \n\nFlanagan (2017) identifies Mencius\u2019 theory of the moral sprouts\nas the ancient precursor of moral modularity theory, an example of\nwhich is Haidt\u2019s moral foundations theory. Just as Mencius held\nthat there are in contemporary parlance automatic,\naffective-cognitive-conative (prompting to action) inclinations and\nintuitions (such as our alarmed and distressed reaction upon seeing a\nchild about to fall into a well) that could develop into the moral\nvirtues (such as ren or humanity), so Haidt theorizes that\nthere are several such modules or \u201cfoundations\u201d\n(Haidt\u2019s look somewhat different from Mencius\u2019, but one\nof Haidt\u2019s modules is \u201charm/care or\nsuffering/compassion\u201d) that form moralities. Flanagan compares\nMencius\u2019 and Haidt\u2019s theories, and finds that each\npossesses a different set of strengths and weaknesses. For example,\nMencius\u2019 theory correctly does not encourage us to think that\nthe sprouts, which begin as automatic, intuitive reactions, remain\nthat way. One of the other Mencian sprouts is the capacity to make\ndistinctions between shi and fei (that\u2019s it,\nand that\u2019s not it, where the first has the connotation of\napproval and the second the connotation of disapproval), and this\ndevelops into the virtue of zhi or wisdom. It looks as if\nthis sprout is the inborn capacity that forms the basis of analogical\nreasoning and other kinds of reflection that in fact go into the\ndevelopment of the other sprouts. For example, natural compassion can\ngrow into the virtue of humanity only when we learn how to care for\nothers and respond to their suffering in an appropriate fashion.\nFlanagan thinks this is the right kind of picture. If we are talking\nabout moral development, what begins as automatic and intuitive should\ndevelop into something that is guided by knowledge, reflection and\nreasoning. By contrast, Haidt\u2019s theory holds that the modules go\nall the way up, in the sense that they remain largely automatic and\nintuitive. On the other hand, Haidt\u2019s theory shows a well-taken\nsensitivity to the possibility that the modules could take different\nforms in different cultures and societies, that some modules could\nreceive greater emphasis in some moralities, and that in fact\ndifferent moralities result from such variation in emphasis. \n\nFinally, recall the case of the Buddhist ideal of impersonal concern\nbeing brought to bear on a debate in Western philosophy over the\nviability of ideals of impersonal concern. This illustrates the point\nthat comparative philosophy can stretch one\u2019s sense of\npossibility, in this case, of human possibility. That is a benefit in\nitself.\n\nComparative philosophy that is done along the Chinese-Western axis can\nproceed from one end or the other, in the attempt to bring to bear\nconcepts, frameworks, and insights from one tradition to the project\nof making progress on questions and problems in the other tradition.\nKwong-loi Shun (2009) has observed that there has been an asymmetry in\nthe amount of work done in these two possible directions. There is\nmuch more work done that starts from the Western end and works towards\nthe Chinese end. Shun questions whether there is a good intellectual\ngrounding for this asymmetry, given that Chinese philosophy promises\nto illuminate some aspects of the ethical life that are not as well\nappreciated or studied in Western philosophy. The alternative, as Shun\nputs it, is that \u201cthat there is no such grounding and that the\n[asymmetrical] tendency is just a collective phenomenon explainable in\nterms of historical trends that wax and wane over time\u201d (2009,\np. 475). In speculating about possible explanations exemplifying\nShun\u2019s second alternative, it is worth reminding ourselves that\nthe trends of philosophy are often reflections or distillations of\nlarger historical trends and the shifting balances of power between\ndifferent regions of the world. If this is so, we may be witnessing an\nincipient correction in the asymmetry between Chinese and Western\nphilosophy.\n\nWhether such a sociological trend is fruitful is a question for\nphilosophical exploration. Sometimes what is gained through\ncomparative inquiry starts with the realization that concepts or major\ndistinctions that one has taken for granted as central to\nphilosophical inquiry are not taken to be so central or even have no\nclose equivalents in another philosophical tradition. That may further\nraise the issues of what role that concept is playing in the first\ntradition, whether the second tradition has no need for that role, and\nwhether this implies some fundamental difference in their orientations\ntoward the ethical life. Shun\u2019s work (2014, 2015) on approaches\nto anger and resentment, and on the absence of a concept of\nforgiveness in Confucianism is an interesting case in point. The way\nthat this work points to a fundamental difference in orientation\ntoward the ethical life might best be brought out in comparison with\nP.F. Strawson\u2019s characterization of resentment as \u201ca\nreaction to injury or indifference.\u201d It is an instance of the\nclass of \u201creactive attitudes\u201d that rest on, and reflect,\nan expectation of, and demand for, \u201cthe manifestation of a\ncertain degree of goodwill or regard on the part of other human beings\ntowards ourselves;\u201d or at least\u201can absence of the\nmanifestation of indifferent disregard\u201d (2008, 15). Resentment,\nthen, is based on a sense of what is due to oneself, and may be\nconceived as a defense of self-respect. Forgiveness may be conceived\nas the foregoing of resentment, and a prominent form of forgiveness\nthat became established in the West is based on the idea that it\nshould only be given if the offender repents. Shun points out that\nConfucians generally regard resentment (yuan) as an emotion\none should rise above. Though anger might be appropriate as a response\nto someone else\u2019s wrongful treatment of the self, it is properly\ndirected at the wrongful treatment rather than at the fact that it was\ndirected at oneself rather than someone else. One should be focused on\ndetermining the appropriate response going forward. This downgrading\nof the ethical status of resentment helps to explain the absence of an\nequivalent in Classical Chinese for forgiveness, especially the kind\nthat should be given only if the offender repents. Resentment is not\nregarded as something one may rightfully bear unless the offender\nrepents. Shun stresses that the generally negative attitude toward\nresentment in Confucianism does not imply a lack of concern for\nself-respect. The basis for self-respect should be the morality of\none\u2019s own actions and character, not how others treat one.\n\nThere are conceptions of forgiveness in the Western tradition that are\ncloser in ethical spirit to the Confucian idea that one should rise\nabove resentment, such as ones that forgive the offender in order to\navoid bitterness and self-consuming anger and seek meaning and purpose\nin striving to prevent further wrongdoing in the future. However, it\nis significant that a very prominent form of Western forgiveness is\nthe foregoing of resentment, which in turn is regarded as appropriate\nand at one\u2019s discretion to forego. It may be revealing of the\nunderlying ethical orientation that the focus is on what others owe to\nthe self, and that the basis of self-respect should depend on how\nothers treat one. That it is focused on the self may be an indication\nof Western individualism, but it is also arguably social in a way that\nmakes self-respect dependent on how others treat one. In this regard,\nConfucianism expresses a more independent spirit in locating the basis\nof self-respect in how the self responds to wrongdoing and not\nprimarily to what was done to oneself. Comparative philosophy can\nresult in surprising comparisons that require qualification of the\nusual broad-stroke comparisons such as individualistic versus social\norientations.\n",
