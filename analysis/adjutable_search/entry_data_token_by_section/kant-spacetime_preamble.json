    "main_text": "\n\nEven a casual reader of Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason\n(Kritik der reinen Vernunft, first published in 1781) will\nnotice the prominence he gives to his discussion of space and time. In\ntandem, scholars consider this discussion to be central to\nKant\u2019s so-called critical philosophy. Given Kant\u2019s\nreputation for developing difficult, not to say obscure, philosophical\nviews, it will also not surprise the reader to learn that there is no\nconsensus on how Kant\u2019s conception of space and time ought to be\ncharacterized and explicated. So the goal of this entry is to bring\nsome clarity to Kant\u2019s views by situating them historically and\nphilosophically within the milieu of some central debates concerning\nspace and time in the early modern period, especially the rich century\nbetween the first edition of Newton\u2019s Principia\nmathematica, which was first published in 1687, and the\npublication of the second edition of the Critique of Pure\nReason exactly a hundred years later. The difficulty of\ncomprehending Kant\u2019s views gives interpreters a reason to place\na special emphasis on context\u2014I will especially highlight\nKant\u2019s reactions to his most significant predecessors in this\narea, Leibniz and Newton. The focus throughout will be on Kant\u2019s\nmagnum opus, the Critique of Pure Reason. Following\ntradition, and to some extent Kant\u2019s own lead, the focus will\nalso be on space and on our representation of space, although parallel\npoints concerning time (and its representation) will sometimes be\nindicated.\n\nIn what follows, the Critique of Pure Reason is cited by the\nusual A/B method; other references are to Kants gesammelte\nSchriften (via \u201cAk\u201d [for Akademie edition] followed\nby volume and page number). The Leibniz-Clarke correspondence is cited\nby referring to author-letter-section (e.g., L 3:1 refers to the first\nsection of Leibniz\u2019s third letter). All translations are by the\nauthor of this entry, unless otherwise noted. The following convention\nis adopted: concepts are referred to by using brackets; e.g., the\nconcept gold is referred to by <gold>. By contrast, we employ\n\u2018gold\u2019 to refer to the word.\n",
