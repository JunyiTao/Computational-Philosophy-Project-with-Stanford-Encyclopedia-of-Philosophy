    "main_text": "Practice\n4. Practice\n\nIt has already been pointed out that Ramus had little interest in the\nprecise requirements for attaining scientific knowledge but was\ninstead primarily concerned with curriculum reforms. Yet he by no\nmeans rejected Aristotelian epistemology, and he accepted that the\nprinciples of every art should be based on experience and observation.\nThe process of acquiring knowledge should consist of four steps, as we\ncan see in the following example. In the first place, we feel\nintoxicated. Secondly, we realize by means of observation\nthat this feeling may have been induced by wine, since we have\nconsumed a great deal of it. But is there actually a causal connection\nbetween our consumption of wine and our feeling of drunkenness? To\nestablish certain knowledge, it is necessary, thirdly, to examine by\nmeans of induction the effects of drinking wine, so that we\ncan conclude that the wine is genuinely the cause of our drunkenness.\nFourthly, we can by means of experience use our knowledge to\navoid getting drunk next time.\n\nAccording to Ramus, there are always three essential aspects of every\nart which need to be considered: nature, principles and practice\n(exercitatio). It was the third element, practice, which was\nessential, for it was through practice that one demonstrated that the\nart and its principles were correct. If they were correct, the art was\nuseful and constructed according to nature. All three elements were\nthus closely connected, and Ramus often presented the various arts by\nsetting out their three main parts (as, for instance, in the\nDialecticae institutiones).\n\nWe have seen that Ramus considered it extremely important to follow\nthe natural method. When, however, it came to practice, this was not\nalways possible. Sometimes it was necessary to start with the most\nparticular, at other times the most general. Practice, moreover,\nrequired analysis as well as synthesis. Ramus wanted students to learn\nlogic by reading and practicing the way we naturally think and argue.\nAn oration or even a poem could reveal how the principles of logic\nwork in practice. We should start by analyzing the text in order to\nsee how it is constructed according to logical principles: what\nproblem is being considered, what arguments are chosen and so on.\nAfter this has been done, the text is further analyzed with help of\nthe main parts of logic, inventio and iudicium, and\nafterwards by the minor parts: the propositions, syllogisms and\nsuchlike (Ramus, Scholae dialecticae, in Scholae in\nliberales artes, cols 192\u2013193; Cf. Ong 1958:\n263\u2013267). When the analysis is completed, it is time for\nstudents to move on to synthesis, the part of practice that Ramus\nusually referred to as genesis. At this stage students were\nexpected to imitate, more or less, the procedure which they had\npreviously studied by means of analysis. This was a crucial moment\nbecause they could now show how useful their studies had been by\ndemonstrating the ways in which they had benefited from their\ntheoretical knowledge.\n\nThe same procedure could be applied to any art since analysis involved\ntextual study. When reading Aristotle\u2019s Physics or\nPliny\u2019s Natural History, students did not examine\nnature but rather what the ancients thought about natural things.\nAlthough this made it possible for them to apply the same procedure,\nbut from a different angle, to other ancient texts, it also restricted\ntheir studies to a great extent by focusing solely on texts. It\ncertainly showed that Ramus\u2019 real intention was to make the\ncurriculum useful to students of the humanities and to future scholars\nand also, by making the course of studies as short and effective as\npossible, to a new category of student, aiming for a different type of\noccupation (Hooykaas 1958: 22; Skalnik 2002: 8).\n\nAs a young lecturer Ramus was accused of violating the rules of the\nUniversity of Paris; and the specific charge was of combining the\ndifferent arts and bringing the study of ancient orators into them.\nThe university statutes prescribed that studies should proceed in a\nspecific order, starting with grammar, followed by rhetoric and so on.\nFor instance, students were expected to read Cicero\u2019s orations\nbefore they went on to logic, which entailed memorizing a large number\nof rules and mnemonic aids such as the pons asinorum, which\nhelped them to find the correct middle terms for various types of\nsyllogism. This accusation may seem somewhat paradoxical given that\nRamus was very anxious not to confuse the arts in any way. Modern\nscholars have emphasized this point too much and overlooked the fact\nthat Ramus actually made a very clear distinction between manuals or\ntextbooks and practice. Nancelius describes the importance Ramus\nattached to combining the different arts in practice and notes that he\nintroduced an educational exercise at his own college, which,\naccording to Nancelius, made all his students more learned and better\norators than at other colleges. It was decisive for Ramus to teach his\ndisciples how to put their knowledge into practice. The curriculum\nthat he himself had followed in his youth, on the other hand, had\nforced students to complete the study of one art before proceeding to\nthe next. Ramus turned this upside down. The arts should be kept\ncompletely separate. When, however, students put what they had learned\ninto practice, they should not hesitate to combine the contents of\ndifferent arts. On the contrary, it was necessary for them to do so in\norder to make their studies truly useful (Nancelius Petri Rami\nVita: 189\u2013193; Mack 2011: 9).\n\nRamus systematized the arts according to his method, which stated that\neach art or doctrina should have exclusive rights to its own\nprinciples. One result of this was that, as mentioned above, he\ntotally rejected metaphysics as a discipline, since ontological issues\ncould not be separated from logical ones. Another was that he defined\nrhetoric as having only two parts: style and delivery\n(elocutio and pronuntiatio). This was an extremely\nradical transformation of rhetoric, which was usually considered to\nhave three additional parts (inventio, iudicium and\nmemoria). It is easy to understand why he excluded\ninventio and iudicium from rhetoric, since he\nregarded them as belonging to dialectic. As Mack points out, this did\nnot in any way mean that Ramus thought that the practice of rhetoric\ncould be restricted solely to style and delivery. On the contrary, he\nstrongly maintained that all the parts of rhetoric and dialectic were\nclosely intertwined in performance; and Mack underlines that Ramus in\nno way wanted to reduce the scope of rhetoric: \n\n\nRamus\u2019 rhetoric and dialectic textbooks take a strongly\ndialectical approach to a syllabus which is primarily rhetorical.\n(Mack 2011: 13) \n\n\nHowever, Ramus\u2019 reason for removing memoria, memory,\nwas typically Ramist. All arts had to be methodologically adapted to\nnature. Since the natural order is also basically our normal way of\nthinking, a genuine knowledge of any art must always be easy for us to\nremember. Therefore, we do not need the aids supplied by\nmnemonics.\n\nAs has already been noted, Ramus\u2019 endeavors to increase the\nefficiency of education and, in this way, make it possible for\nstudents of lesser means to study, pushed him to change the curriculum\nradically and shorten it. It would take no more than seven years to\ncomplete, which was a considerable reduction compared to all other\ncurricula. Nevertheless, he included some mathematical sub-disciplines\nsuch as mechanics that were normally not studied. His lectures on the\nhistory of mathematics revealed an increasing disapproval of the\nancient Greeks\u2019 inclination for making mathematics too abstract\nand, consequently, neglecting its application; Euclid was considered\none of those who was most to blame. Ramus even censured Archimedes for\nnot having assigned sufficient importance to utility and for having\nbeen too prone to direct his projects towards pure contemplation.\nRamus himself lauded the way the German city of Nuremberg had instead\nsupported and encouraged the study of the mechanical arts; for him,\nsuch a syllabus was the key to the future (Ramus, Scholarum\nmathematicarum, p. 28 and Collectaneae praefationes,\nepistolae, orationes, pp. 136\u2013137, and see Hotson 2007:\n80).\n",
