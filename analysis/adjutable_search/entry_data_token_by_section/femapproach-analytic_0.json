    "main_text": "The Tradition Analytic Feminists Share with Other Analytic Philosophers\n1. The Tradition Analytic Feminists Share with Other Analytic Philosophers\n\nContemporary analytic philosophers, feminist and nonfeminist, can be\ncharacterized roughly as follows: they consider (some of)\n Frege,\n Russell,\n Moore,\n Wittgenstein, and the\n Logical Positivists\n to be their intellectual ancestors; they tend to prize explicit\nargumentation and the literal, precise, and clear use of language;\nthey often value the roles of philosophy of language, epistemology,\nand logic; and they typically view their stock of philosophical\nconcepts, methods, and assumptions to be a) consistent with their\nModern European heritage, and b) in contrast with methods originating\nin continental Europe since 1900, from phenomenology and\nexistentialism through poststructuralism and new materialism.\n\nOf course, each strand of mid-twentieth-century, \u201cclassic\u201d\nanalytic philosophy has changed greatly. Many central dogmas have been\nundermined, and nonfeminists and feminists alike have\n\u201cnaturalized\u201d, \u201csocialized\u201d, and otherwise\nmodulated the earlier, more abstract and highly normative enterprises\nand doctrines. However, regardless of the extent of the evolution of\n\u201canalytic philosophy\u201d, the degree to which methodological\nboundaries are blurred today, and the fruitfulness of intersections\namong methods, a number of feminist and nonfeminist philosophers\ncontinue to think of themselves in the historical trajectory of\nanalytic philosophy and find the tradition valuable. They claim the\nterm \u201canalytic philosopher\u201d for themselves, even if others\nmight prefer the term\n \u201cpost-analytic\u201d.[2]\n",
