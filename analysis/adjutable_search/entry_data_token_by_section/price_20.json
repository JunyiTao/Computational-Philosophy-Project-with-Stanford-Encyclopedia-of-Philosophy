    "main_text": "Building on Hume || Hume\u2019s Theory of Belief\n4.6 Hume\u2019s Theory of Belief\n\nPrice (1969: ch. 7) extensively discusses Hume\u2019s theory of\nbelief, the solution to Hume\u2019s new problem about belief (1969:\n160), which asks: \u201cWhat is belief?\u201d, and \u201cHow do we\ndistinguish belief from disbelief and merely entertaining a\nproposition without belief or disbelief?\u201d Price does not relate\nHume\u2019s problem to its natural background, Locke and\nBerkeley\u2019s ideational models of understanding. For Price,\nHume\u2019s central point is that when entertaining a belief, which\namounts to having a structure of ideas, we entertain the very same\nideas as when we simply consider the claim without believing it; so\nbelief cannot consist in the addition of an extra idea (1969:\n160\u2013161).\n\nHume\u2019s proposal is, famously, that talk of \u201cbelief\u201d\nstands for the presence of the ideas being more lively or vivacious.\nFurther, Hume\u2019s view is that the terms \u201csolidity\u201d\nand \u201csteadiness\u201d enable us to focus on the special\n\u201cfeel\u201d of believed thoughts, produced by an impression\nwith its own high degree of vivacity. On his picture, the\nimpression\u2019s high \u201cvivacity\u201d creates the\nideas\u2019 vivacity by being based on the experience of constant\nconjunction establishing evidence of a causal link between the present\nimpression\u2019s content and the idea in the belief.\n\nPrice criticises Hume for supposing that the link must be causal. If I\nsee a tree I shall believe that it has roots, but not because the tree\ncauses the roots, but because trees have roots as their parts (see\nalso\n \u00a74.5).\n Price sees another severe limitation: Hume\u2019s account does not\nfit belief in generalisations themselves. If seeing some water makes\nme think of the law that water freezes at 0\u00b0C, that is not because\nthe sight of water is linked to seeing it freeze at that temperature.\nAnd, his model of belief-formation does not apply to beliefs formed by\ninference.\n",
