    "main_text": "Emergence\n7. Emergence\n\n\nPaul Humphreys (2004) and Mark Bedau (1997, 2011) have argued that\nphilosophers interested in the topic of emergence can learn a great\ndeal by looking at computer simulation. Philosophers\ninterested in this topic should consult the entry on \n emergent properties,\nwhere the contributions of all these philosophers have been\ndiscussed. \n\n\nThe connection between emergence and simulation was perhaps best\narticulated by Bedau in his (2011). Bedau argued that any\nconception of emergence must meet the twin hallmarks of explaining how\nthe whole depends on its parts and how the whole is independent of its\nparts. He argues that philosophers often focus on what he calls\n\u201cstrong\u201d emergence, which posits brute downward causation that is\nirreducible in principle. But he argues that this is a\nmistake. He focuses instead  on what he calls \u201cweak\u201d\nemergence, which allows for reducibility of wholes to parts\nin principle but not in practice. Systems that\nproduce emergent properties are mere mechanisms, but the mechanisms are\nvery complex (they have very many independently interacting parts). As\na result, there is no way to figure out exactly what will happen given\na specific set of initial and boundary conditions, except to \u201ccrawl the\ncausal web\u201d. It is here that the connection to computer\nsimulation arises. Weakly emergent properties are characteristic\nof complex systems in nature. And it is also characteristic of\ncomplex computer simulations that there is no way to predict what they\nwill do except to let them run. Weak emergence explains, according to\nBedau, why computer simulations play a central role in the\nscience of complex systems. The best way to understand and predict how\nreal complex systems behave is to simulate them by crawling the\nmicro-causal web, and see what happens.\n",
