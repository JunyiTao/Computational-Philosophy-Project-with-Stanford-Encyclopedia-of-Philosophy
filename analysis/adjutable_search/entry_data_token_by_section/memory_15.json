The primary motivations for direct realism about the objects\nof memory parallel the motivations for direct realism about the\nobjects of perception. One motivation is the thought that positing\nrepresentations that stand as intermediaries between the remembering\nsubject and the remembered object may have sceptical implications for\nour ability to know the past. Another motivation is the thought that\nremembering is phenomenologically direct, that is, that, in\nremembering, we attend to past events, not to internal representations\nof past events. The work on metamemory discussed in\nsection 4 suggests that remembering may in fact\noften be phenomenologically indirect rather than phenomenologically\ndirect. But there are more serious problems for direct realism, and\nit is these that provide the primary motivation for indirect realism.\n5.1.2 Indirect realism\n\nIndirect realism (defended by J. Locke ([1689] 1998), Hume ([1739]\n2011), and, more recently, B. Russell (1921)) claims that, when one\nremembers, one is in the first instance related to internal\nrepresentations of past events. Here, again, the dialectic parallels\nthat of the debate between direct and indirect realists about the\nobjects of perception. In the domain of perception,\nthe argument from\nhallucination takes the possibility of the occurrence of hallucinations\nindistinguishable from successful perceptions to suggest that\nhallucination and successful perception have something in common,\nnamely, an internal representation of a scene, and that it is to this\nthat the subject is related in the first instance in both cases. In\nthe domain of memory, the argument from memory\nhallucination\u2014or,\nas it would more aptly be called, the argument from\nconfabulation\u2014appeals to the possibility of\nthe occurrence of confabulations indistinguishable from successful\nmemories to suggest that confabulation and successful memory have in\ncommon an internal representation of a past event and that it is to\nthis that the subject is related in the first instance in both cases.\nDenying that representations are the direct objects of the relevant\nmental states, moreover, leads to disjunctivism, according to which\nperception or memory, on the one hand, and hallucination or\nconfabulation, on the other hand, are states of fundamentally\ndifferent kinds. Some have been prepared to defend disjunctivism about\nmemory (Debus 2008), but the cognitive processes at work in memory and\nconfabulation are highly similar, making disjunctive an unattractive\noption from any broadly naturalistic standpoint.\n5.1.3 Compromise and hybrid views\n\nDirect realism nevertheless retains its intuitive appeal, and some\nhave therefore advocated a compromise between it and indirect realism.\nBernecker (2008), for example, argues for the compatibility of the\ncausal theory of memory\u2014most versions of which\ntreat memory as involving representations\u2014and\ndirect realism about the objects of memory on the ground that\nremembering a past event may require having a suitable representation\nof the event without requiring that one be aware of the representation.\nA compromise view of this sort may provide a response to the argument\nfrom confabulation, since it acknowledges a role for representations\nin both successful memory and confabulation. But it does not by\nitself provide a response to a distinct problem, the\ncotemporality problem. The cotemporality problem arises\nbecause, while direct realism claims that the direct object of a\npresent memory is a past event, there is no obvious sense in which a\nsubject now might be directly related to a past event. Bernecker\n(2008) argues that the cotemporality problem can be avoided if we\nassume that past events continue to exist even after they have\noccurred. This may, however, be a high metaphysical price to\npay simply in order to respect direct realist intuitions.\n\nEven if concerns about the metaphysical price of\nBernecker\u2019s view are set aside,\nthere remain concerns about whether the view achieves a genuine\ncompromise between direct and indirect realism.\nSince the view acknowledges that representations play an indispensable\nrole in remembering, it remains, at bottom, representationalist in\ncharacter. The recent philosophy of perception literature, however,\nsuggests the possibility of a view of the objects of memory which\nincorporates elements of both representationalism and relationalism.\nIn that literature, the focus is on the character of perceptual\nexperience, with relationalists arguing that what determines a\nsubject\u2019s perceptual experience is an external\nscene, while representationalists argue that what determines it is an\ninternal representation. This focus on perceptual experience opens up the\npossibility of hybrid views, according to which perceptual experience\nis partly determined by external scenes and partly determined by\ninternal representations (e.g., Schellenberg 2014). At present, the\nprospects for hybrid views of memory remain unexplored.\n5.2 Memory traces\n\nIn addition to retrieved representations, most theories see\nremembering as involving stored traces. Both the existence\nand the precise role of traces have, however, been matters of\ncontroversy.\n5.2.1 The existence of traces\n\nOpposition to including references to traces in a philosophical theory\nof remembering often stems from particular conceptions of the nature\nof philosophical, as opposed to scientific, theories. Thus some have\nargued that philosophical theories of remembering should not posit\ntraces on the ground that philosophical theories are or should be\nconcerned with the nature of remembering as such, or perhaps with the\nconcept of memory, whereas traces pertain to the mechanisms that, as a\nmatter of contingent fact, underwrite the process of remembering (D.\nLocke 1971). One response to this argument maintains that the nature\nof remembering cannot be understood without understanding the\nmechanisms that underwrite the process of remembering (Sutton 1998).\nAnother response maintains, more strongly, that traces may be part of\nthe very concept of remembering (De Brigard 2014b; C.B.\nMartin & Deutscher 1966).\n\nOthers have argued that philosophical theories of remembering should\nnot posit memory traces on the ground that philosophical theories\nought not to dictate to scientific theories and that traces belong to\nthe province of the latter (Zemach 1983). One response to this\nargument advocates a retreat to a purely logical conception of memory\ntraces, devoid of any empirical detail (Heil 1978; D.A. Rosen 1975).\nAnother response advocates the development of a conception of traces\nbased on current scientific theories of remembering (Sutton 1998).\nThis response, in turn, motivates the distributed conception of traces\nintroduced in section 4. As we have seen, the\ndistributed conception is not without its disadvantages; in particular,\nit may have troubling implications for the causal theory. But it has\nadvantages as well; in particular, it may ground a response to\nWittgensteinian (1980; see also Malcolm [1963] 1975)\nantirepresentationalist arguments, which often presuppose a local\nconception of traces (Sutton 2015).\n5.2.2 The role of traces\n\nAssuming that the existence of traces is granted, a full account of\nremembering will have to describe the relationship between traces, the\nrepresentations produced by retrieval, and the representations\ninvolved in perceptual experience.\n\nDe Brigard (2014b) reviews several positions that have historically\nbeen defended regarding the relationship between traces and perceptual\nrepresentations. Semidirect representationalism holds that\nperception is indirect and that traces are the same as the\nrepresentations involved in perception. Indirect\nrepresentationalism holds that perception is indirect and that\ntraces are distinct from the representations involved in perception.\nAs De Brigard emphasizes, what ultimately matters here is\nrelationships among contents rather than vehicles. He thus\ndistinguishes between content invariantism, which holds that\nthe content of the trace is the same as that of the perceptual\nrepresentation, and content variantism, which holds that the\ncontent of the trace may differ from that of the perceptual\nrepresentation. In practice, since the invariantist/variantist\ndistinction cuts across the semidirect/indirect distinction, which\nconcerns relationships among vehicles rather than contents, semidirect\nand indirect representationalism can often be grouped together.\nDirect representationalism holds that perception is direct\nand that traces are created after perception occurs. Extending De\nBrigard\u2019s nomenclature, direct relationalism\nwould hold that perception is direct and that remembering does not involve\ntraces.\n\nDe Brigard\u2019s approach does not explicitly take the\nrelationship between traces and retrieved representations into account, and\ntaking this relationship into account expands the range of possible\npositions. As before, perception might be held either to be direct or\nto be indirect. If perception is direct, storage might be held either\nnot to involve traces or to involve traces. If storage does not\ninvolve traces, retrieval might be held to be either direct or\nindirect. The former possibility corresponds to a straightforward\nversion of direct relationalism. The latter possibility, on which\nneither perception nor storage involves representations but on which\nretrieval does involve representations, would be difficult to\nmotivate, as it is difficult to see from where the content of\nretrieved representations might come if it is not supplied by memory\ntraces. If storage does involve traces, retrieval might, again, be\nheld to be either direct or indirect. The former possibility, on which\nneither perception nor retrieval involves representations but on which\nstorage does involve representations, would be difficult to motivate,\nas it is difficult to see what role traces might play given that they\ndo not contribute to retrieval. The latter possibility is the natural\nway of understanding direct representationalism.\n\nIf perception is indirect, storage might be held either not to involve\ntraces or to involve traces. If storage does not involve traces,\nretrieval might be held to be either direct or indirect. The former\npossibility, on which perception involves representations but neither\nstorage nor retrieval involves representations, would be difficult to\nmotivate, as the considerations that motivate relationalism about\nmemory likewise motivate relationalism about perception. The latter\npossibility, on which perception and retrieval involve representations\nbut storage does not, corresponds roughly to a view advocated by\nVosgerau (2010); on this view, storage may in a sense involve traces,\nbut stored traces, due to their inactive character, cannot be said to\nhave content. If storage does involve traces, retrieval might be held\nto be either direct or indirect. The former possibility, on which\nperception and storage involve representations but retrieval does not,\nwould be difficult to motivate, as, again, the considerations that\nmotivate relationalism about memory likewise motivate relationalism\nabout perception. The latter possibility is the natural way of\nunderstanding both semidirect representationalism and indirect\nrepresentationalism.\n\nTaking the relationship between traces and retrieved representations\ninto account also complicates the distinction between content\ninvariantism and content variantism. De Brigard applies the\ndistinction to the relationship between the contents of perceptual\nrepresentations and the contents of traces. It may also be applied to\nthe relationship between the contents of traces and the contents of\nretrieved representations. But what ultimately matters here is the\nrelationship between the contents of perceptual representations and\nthe contents of retrieved representations. One is a content\ninvariantist with respect to this relationship if one holds that the\ncontent of the retrieved representation is the same as the content of\nthe perceptual representation, and one is a content variantist if one\nholds that the content of the retrieved representation may differ from\nthe content of the perceptual representation. Any view on which both\nperception and retrieval involve\nrepresentations\u2014including semidirect\nrepresentationalism, indirect representationalism, and something like\nVosgerau\u2019s view\u2014may be\ncombined with either content invariantism or content variantism.\n\nPhilosophers have often treated remembering as a basically\npreservative process, but this should not be taken to suggest that\ncontent invariantism is the standard view in philosophy. While there\nhave been attempts to identify purely preservative forms of memory\n(Dokic 2001), most philosophical theories of remembering allow for two\nkinds of variance between the content of retrieved representations and\nthe content of perceptual representations. First, all theories allow\nfor the subtraction of content through forgetting. Second, many\ntheories allow for the addition of self-reflexive, second-order\ncontent of the sort described in section 3. Thus\ncontent variantism is in fact the standard view. Note, however,\nthat the standard form of content variantism permits the addition of\nsecond-order content concerning the subject\u2019s\nrelationship to the remembered event but forbids the addition of\nfirst-order content concerning the event itself. Most theories of\nremembering thus remain preservationist in spirit. Another possible\nform of content variantism permits the addition of both second-order\ncontent and first-order content. Generationist theories of remembering\nentail this more radical form of content variantism.\n6. Accuracy\n\nGenerationist forms of content variantism raise the question of\naccuracy in memory in an especially vivid way: if the content of the\nretrieved representation can differ from that of the trace, which can\nin turn differ from that of the perceptual\nrepresentation\u2014or if,\nas the simulation theory claims, there need be no trace linking the\nretrieved representation and the perceptual\nrepresentation\u2014there\nwould seem to be no guarantee that memory provides us with accurate\nrepresentations of past events. Generationist forms of content\nvariantism do not, however, guarantee inaccuracy, and preservationist\nforms of content variantism do not guarantee accuracy, for the\naccuracy of memory has two distinct dimensions.\n6.1 Truth and authenticity\n\nAdopting Bernecker\u2019s (2010) terminology,\nauthenticity refers to the correspondence between the\nmemory representation and the subject\u2019s\nexperience of the past event, while truth\nrefers to the correspondence between the memory representation and the\npast event itself. Crucially, neither sort of accuracy entails the\nother. A retrieved representation may be authentic, but, if the\nsubject misperceived the relevant event, it may nevertheless not be\ntrue. A retrieved representation may be true, but, if the subject\nmisperceived the relevant event, or if he accurately perceived an\naspect of it other than what is given to him by the retrieved\nrepresentation, it may nevertheless not be authentic.\n\nThus, while preservative forms of content variantism imply that\ngenuine memories are always authentic, such memories are not always\ntrue. Authenticity implies truth only where the subject\u2019s\noriginal experience itself was accurate with respect to the\nexperienced event. Cases of misperception, again, illustrate the\npossibility of authenticity without truth. Preservationists who wish\nto hold that genuine memories are always true must therefore impose\nthis as an additional requirement, above and beyond what is required\nby the core of their theory. By the same token, while generative forms\nof content variantism allow that genuine memories are sometimes\ninauthentic, such memories are not always false. Inauthenticity\nimplies falsity only where the subject\u2019s\noriginal experience was both accurate and complete. Cases of boundary\nextension (discussed above) or field-observer perspective switching\n(Debus 2007b; McCarroll 2017; Sutton 2010b) illustrate the possibility of\ninauthenticity without falsity. In cases of perspective switching, the\nsubject perceives an event from one perspective (field perspective)\nbut remembers it from another, perhaps even seeing himself in the\nscene (observer perspective); while many or most observer memories are\ninauthentic (since they fail to correspond to the subject\u2019s\noriginal experience), they are not necessarily false (since they may\ncorrespond to what an observer would have seen). For these reasons,\ngenerationists do not hold that genuine memories are always authentic.\nBut those who wish to hold that genuine memories are always true can\nimpose this as an additional requirement\n6.2 Factivity\n\nTo impose this additional requirement is to claim that memory is\nfactive, in the sense that genuine memories are necessarily\ntrue, that is, that apparent memories that are not true are\nmerely apparent. In philosophy, the view that memory is\nfactive has been common. The standard arguments for the factivity of\nmemory are linguistic, appealing to the apparent incoherence of\nasserting both that one remembers an event and that the event did not\noccur (Bernecker 2017; cf.\nMoore\u2019s paradox).\n Assessing these arguments is beyond the scope of this entry, but note\nthat they are controversial even among those who give linguistic\narguments a great deal of weight (De Brigard 2017; Hazlett 2010).\nAmong naturalists, who often give linguistic arguments less weight,\nthey are more controversial still. From a naturalistic point of view,\nthe goal of a theory of remembering ought to be to describe the\nprocess of remembering itself, regardless of whether we are\nintuitively inclined to classify its results as genuine or merely\napparent memories. If the same process may be responsible both for\nproducing true memories and for producing false memories, then an\nadequate theory of remembering will not require that genuine memories\nare always true\u2014in the terms introduced in\nsection 2, the relevant natural kind may include both\ntrue and false memories, regardless of whether our ordinary linguistic\npractice permits us to group them together.\n\nIn psychology, the view that memory is factive has been much less\ncommon. This is not very surprising, given that much psychological\nresearch on remembering focuses on unsuccessful remembering:\nunderstanding how unsuccessful remembering occurs provides important\ninsights into the mechanisms responsible for successful remembering,\njust as understanding how perceptual illusions and hallucinations\noccur provides important insights into the mechanisms response for\nsuccessful perception. What is more surprising is that psychologists\nhave sometimes gone too far in the opposite direction, assuming that,\nbecause remembering is constructive, it is bound to be false (Ost\n& Costall 2002). This is in effect to treat memory as\ncounterfactive. The distinction between authenticity and\ntruth enables us to see that constructive, generative remembering need\nnot be characterized by falsity. The generative character of\nremembering does, however, point to the need for a more sophisticated\ncriterion of truth (S. Campbell 2014). While the fact that remembering\nis generative does not imply that memories are bound to be outright\nfalse, it does suggest that they are frequently false in some\nrespects. This, in turn, suggests that remembering need not be fully\naccurate in order to be fully adequate, thus pointing towards a need\nfor a criterion that acknowledges that truth in memory comes in\ndegrees.\n7. The Self\n\nThe question of truth in memory derives much of its importance from\nthe role played by memory in relation to the self. It is something of\na clich\u00e9 to observe that memory makes us who\nwe are, but memory is indeed intimately linked to the self.\n7.1 Personal identity\n\nLocke ([1689] 1998)\u2014who was perhaps anticipated in this by\nSpinoza (Lin 2005)\u2014discussed the idea that what makes a person\nat a given time count as the same person as a person at an earlier\ntime is that he remembers the earlier person\u2019s experiences. This\nmemory theory of personal identity\n has been much discussed since Locke (Mathews, Bok, & Rabins\n2009), and there are well-known substantive and methodological\nproblems for it. The primary substantive problem is that the memory\ncriterion for personal identity appears to be uninformative, because\none can by definition remember only one\u2019s own experiences, not\nthose of anyone else\u2014if memory thus presupposes personal\nidentity, it is unenlightening to say that personal identity\npresupposes memory. There have been attempts to meet this objection by\nintroducing the notion of quasi-memory, which is meant to be\nlike the notion of memory without the implication of personal identity\n(Buford 2009; Parfit 1984; Roache 2006; Shoemaker 1970). While the\nnotion of quasi-memory may enable us to disentangle memory from\npersonal identity, it remains to be seen whether it is empirically\ndefensible (Northoff 2000).\n\nThe primary methodological problem is that arguments for and against\nthe memory criterion tend to rely on thought experiments involving\nmemory swapping and other such cases. Moving away from these far-out\ncases, some philosophers have preferred to consider the implications\nof real memory disorders. Craver (2012; cf. Craver, Kwan, Steindam,\n& Rosenbaum 2014), for example, has argued on\nthe basis of cases of episodic amnesia such as that of the well known\npatient KC (Rosenbaum et al. 2005) that memory is not a presupposition of\nselfhood. Others have preferred to build on cognitive psychological\ntheories of autobiographical memory. Schechtman (1994, 2011), for\nexample, has argued that memory does not and need not provide simple\nconnections between discrete past and present moments of\nconsciousness, maintaining that what matters, as far as the sense of\npersonal identity is concerned, is the way in which autobiographical\nmemory summarizes, constructs, interprets, and condenses distinct\nmoments from the personal past to produce a coherent overall narrative\n(cf. Goldie 2012). Approaches such as Schechtman\u2019s appear to\ninvolve a change of subject, from personal identity as such\nto the subject\u2019s sense of personal identity. This shift\nis explicit in Klein and Nichols\u2019 (2012) examination of the role\nof autonoesis in underwriting the sense of personal identity\u2014the\nsense that one now is the same person as someone at an earlier time.\nRoache (2016) has questioned Klein and Nichols\u2019 interpretation\nof the clinical case on which their argument depends, and the debate\nover the relationship between autonoesis and the sense of personal\nidentity is ongoing (Fern\u00e1ndez forthcoming; Klein 2016b).\n7.2 Autobiographical memory\n\nSuch approaches also appear to involve a second change of subject,\nfrom episodic memory to autobiographical memory. The\nextent to which this actually constitutes a change of subject is\ndebatable, for the relationship between episodic and autobiographical\nmemory is itself a matter of debate. Some philosophers have held that\nall episodic memories are autobiographical (Hoerl 1999). In\ndevelopmental psychology, however, episodic memory, understood as a\ncapacity to remember particular events, is often treated as emerging\nbefore autobiographical memory, which requires a capacity to organize\nindividual events into coherent narratives. Thus, autobiographical\nmemory is usually understood as including more than episodic memory.\nConway and Pleydell-Pearce\u2019s (2000; cf. Conway 2005)\ninfluential view, for example, sees autobiographical memory as emerging from what\nthey refer to as the self-memory system, including an\nautobiographical knowledge base containing information about specific\nevents, general events, and broader life periods. Accounts of\npersonal semantic memory go further, describing a form of\nmemory for one\u2019s past that is distinct from both episodic and\nsemantic memory (Renoult, Davidson, Palombo, Moscovitch, & Levine\n2012). Views emphasizing narrativity are also influential\n(Hutto 2017); rather than seeing autobiographical memory in terms of\nstored information, Brockmeier (2015), for example, sees\nautobiographical remembering as a process in which autobiographical\nmemories themselves emerge through the subject\u2019s active\nconstruction of a life narrative. Interestingly, Cosentino (2011) has\nargued that the linguistic capacity at work in the construction of\nlife narratives itself depends on the capacity for mental time travel,\nincluding episodic memory.\n7.2.1 Rilkean memory\n\nThere is thus a need for work devoted to clarifying the concept of\nautobiographical memory. In addition to clarifying the relationship\nbetween autobiographical memory and episodic memory, such work might\nalso take more exotic forms of autobiographical memory into account.\nRowlands (2015, 2016), for example, has recently introduced the\nconcept of Rilkean memory. Rilkean memory, as Rowlands\ndefines it, is a type of autobiographical memory that is neither\nepisodic nor semantic. Episodic and semantic memories have content,\nbut Rowlands maintains that these are sometimes transformed into\nsomething else which, while lacking content, is nevertheless\nrecognizable as a form of autobiographical memory. These Rilkean\nmemories can be either embodied or affective. Embodied Rilkean\nmemories manifest themselves in the form of bodily and behavioural\ndispositions, such as when a runner adopts a certain posture due to\npast injuries. Affective Rilkean memories manifest themselves when one\nhas certain feelings or moods in response to certain stimuli due to\ncertain past experiences, without being able to bring any information\nabout those experiences to mind.\n7.2.2 Memory and emotion\n\nThough Rilkean memory clearly bears some relationship to recognized\nforms of memory, it is, as Rowlands himself acknowledges, not entirely\nclear whether it ultimately merits the name\n\u201cmemory\u201d. The\nconcept of Rilkean memory does, however, foreground the role of\naffect, including emotion, in autobiographical remembering. The\nrelationship between memory and emotion is complex and multifaceted\n(see de Sousa 2017), but two issues in particular stand out. First, we\nroutinely experience emotions when we remember. These emotions may be\nunderstood as themselves being memories, namely, memories of past\nemotions, or they may be understood as being present emotions directed\nat past events. Debus (2007a) argues for the latter possibility, but,\neven if she is right, we do presumably sometimes have memories of past\nemotions. This, in turn, raises the question of whether remembered\nemotions are themselves emotions, as well as the question of how we\nare to understand present emotions directed at remembered past\nemotions.\n\nSecond, certain emotions, such as nostalgia, are necessarily\npast-directed. Such intrinsically past-directed emotions raise\ninteresting questions. Howard (2012), for example, argues that\nnostalgia can arise in connection with memories that are known to the\nrememberer to be nonveridical. This implies that a version of\nthe paradox of fiction\u2014the\nchallenge of explaining how an audience can feel something in\nrelation to an event they know to be fictional\u2014arises for\nmemory. It also raises the question of whether nostalgia felt in\nconnection with memories that are known to the rememberer to be\nnonveridical is necessarily inappropriate or whether it can under some\ncircumstances be appropriate.\n8. Beyond Individual Memory\n\nWhile most research on the metaphysics of memory has assumed that\nremembering is something done by individuals on their own, this\nassumption has recently been challenged, as researchers have drawn on\naccounts of cognition as distributed or extended to interrogate the\nrole of external memory and on ideas from the burgeoning\ninterdisciplinary field of memory studies to investigate the\npossibility of more or less robustly collective forms of\nmemory.\n8.1 External memory\n\nA distinction is sometimes drawn between distributed and\nextended accounts of cognition, with the former referring to\na line of research in cognitive science that focuses on cognition in\ncomplex sociotechnical systems consisting of multiple human and\ntechnological components (Hutchins 1995) and the latter to a current\nin philosophy of mind that focuses on cognition in systems centred on\nhuman subjects augmented by technological or sometimes social\nresources (Clark & Chalmers 1998). Accounts of\nboth sorts are committed to the rejection of traditional\n\u201cintracranialist\u201d\nviews of cognition and their replacement with the\n\u201cextracranialist\u201d\nview that cognition sometimes exceeds the bounds of the individual brain,\nand the difference between them may thus be merely one of emphasis, as\ndistributed cognition theorists emphasize remembering in sociotechnical\nsystems, while extended cognition theorists emphasize remembering in\ntechnologically-augmented individuals. Thus Hutchins (1995) considers\nhow a cockpit\u2014or rather the system consisting of the pilots of\nan airliner plus various instruments\u2014remembers its speeds, while\nClark and Chalmers focus on the case of Otto, a (hypothetical)\nAlzheimer\u2019s patient who relies on a notebook to supplement his\nunreliable memory. While both accounts are in agreement on the point\nthat external resources may count as memory stores only in the context\nof larger systems, both confront us with the role of various forms of\nexternal memory in human remembering.\n8.1.1 The concept of external memory\n\nOne question about external memory concerns the concept of external\nmemory itself. Clark and Chalmers\u2019 argument appeals to apparent\nfunctional analogies between Otto\u2019s notebook and internal memory\nin non-memory-impaired individuals, suggesting that, in virtue of\nthese analogies, appropriate external resources may, when certain\nconditions are met, qualify as literal external memory stores.\nOpposition to their argument has thus been driven by a variety of\napparent functional disanalogies between internal and external memory\n(Adams & Aizawa 2008; Rupert 2009). External\nmemory, which tends to be designed to provide highly stable storage,\ndoes not, for example, duplicate the constructive character of\ninternal memory. One response to these disanalogies is to retreat to a\nmore moderate alternative to extended cognition, such as embedded\n(Rupert 2009), scaffolded (Arango-Mu\u00f1oz 2013; Sterelny 2010),\nor situated (Sutton 2009) cognition, on which external resources may\nplay a vital role in remembering without themselves literally taking\npart in the memory process. Another response is to move away from\nparity-based arguments for extended cognition of the sort\noffered by Clark and Chalmers to the complementarity-based\narguments advanced by Clark in subsequent work (e.g., Clark 2003).\nWhile the former appeal to functional analogies between internal and\nexternal memory, the latter appeal to functional disanalogies,\nsuggesting that external memory comes to play a role in remembering\nprecisely because it does not mimic internal memory (Sutton 2010a).\nGiven the constructive character of internal memory, for example,\nstable forms of external memory may make a distinct and valuable\ncontribution to remembering.\n8.1.2 Cognitive consequences of new forms of external memory\n\nAnother question concerns the cognitive consequences of our growing\nreliance on novel forms of external memory. Regardless of whether\nexternal memory literally takes part in the memory process, our\nreliance on such forms of external memory, particularly when they are\ninternet-connected, may have important cognitive consequences (Smart\n2012). Some have worried that these are purely negative, with external\nmemory diminishing internal memory in one way or another (e.g., Carr\n2010), but whether this in fact occurs is an empirical question. There\nis some research suggesting that, when we know that information will\nbe available online, we tend to remember how to find that information,\nrather than remembering the information itself (Sparrow, Liu,\n& Wegner 2011). The consequences of our use of\nweb-connected forms of external memory have, however, only begun to be\nstudied, and it may be instructive here to recall that Plato already\nvoiced the worry that an older external memory technology, namely,\nwriting itself, would have a negative impact on our ability to remember,\na worry that most today would dismiss without a second thought.\n8.2 Collective memory\n\nIn addition to the growing literature on the ways in which\ntechnological resources contribute to remembering, there is a large\nand dynamic literature on the ways in which groups remember together.\nOr rather there are two distinct literatures here, one concerning\nsmall-scale groups, the other concerning large-scale\ngroups. The former has been investigated primarily in psychology,\nexemplified by studies of remembering in married couples (Harris,\nBarnier, Sutton, & Keil 2014) or in mother-child dyads\n(Reese, Haden, & Fivush 1993). The latter has been\ninvestigated primarily in the social sciences and history, where, in what\nhas been termed a \u201cmemory boom\u201d\n(Blight 2009), an enormous amount of work on\nhow nations and similar entities remember their pasts has appeared in\nrecent years. One question of philosophical interest in this general\narea is the relationship between memory in small-scale groups and\nmemory in large-scale groups. There is increasing interaction between\nthe two literatures (Bietti & Sutton 2015; Fagin,\nYamashiro, & Hirst 2013; Roediger\n& Abel 2015), and it may turn out that\nsimilar processes of remembering unfold in both small-scale and\nlarge-scale groups. But small-scale and large-scale collective memory,\nas we will see, do appear to raise somewhat different issues, and it\nmay turn out not to be a contingent matter that they have for the most\npart been studied in different disciplines.\n8.2.1 Memory in small-scale groups\n\nThe central question concerning memory in small-scale groups is\nperhaps whether such groups manifest emergent, robustly\ncollective forms of memory. A range of views on this question are\navailable (Barnier, Sutton, Harris, & Wilson 2008;\nWilson 2005), but the conservative view is certainly that, while remembering\nmay be affected by the social context in which it occurs, it is itself always\na strictly individual-level process. The conservative view is the\nnatural starting point, but there is a surprisingly good case to be\nmade for the radical view that remembering is sometimes a group-level\nprocess. A promising place to look for robustly collective forms of\nmemory is in transactive memory systems (Wegner 1987):\nstable, ongoing groups characterized by a division of responsibility\nfor remembering and a shared metacognitive awareness of that division\n(Kirchhoff 2016; Theiner, Allen, & Goldstone 2010;\nTollefsen, Dale, & Paxton 2013). Drawing on\nWimsatt\u2019s (1986) notion of\nemergence, for example, Theiner (2013) has provided a rigorous\nargument for the view that transactive memory systems manifest a form\nof emergent memory, in the sense that the group has a memory capacity\nof its own, over and above those of its individual members. Drawing on\na somewhat different theoretical framework, Huebner (2013, 2016) has\ndeveloped a complementary approach. Thus, while the question remains\nopen, the conservative view may no longer be the obvious starting\npoint.\n8.2.2 Memory in large-scale groups\n\nThe central question concerning memory in large-scale groups is\nwhether such groups are capable of remembering in anything like the\nsense in which individuals are capable of remembering. Applying\nconcepts developed in the domain of individual memory to the domain of\nsmall-scale collective memory may already be problematic; applying\nthem to the domain of large-scale collective memory may be more\nproblematic still. Anastasio et al. (2012), for example, have argued\nthat the concept of consolidation (referring to the process\nthrough which unstable, short-term memory representations are\ntransformed into stable, long-term memory representations) applies\nboth at the level of individuals and at the level of societies, but\nthis argument may overlook the disanalogies between internal and\nexternal memory noted above. Similarly, Tanesini (forthcoming) has\nargued that the concept of amnesia (referring to the\ninability of an agent to retrieve memories that would normally be\nretrievable) applies both at the level of individuals and at the level\nof societies, but there is little evidence that patterns of\nremembering and forgetting at the social level correspond particularly\nclosely to patterns at the individual level. Along the same general\nlines, Szpunar and Szpunar (2016; cf. Merck, Topcu, &\nHirst (2016)) have argued that the concept of episodic future\nthought (introduced above) applies both at the level of\nindividuals and at the level of societies, but it is unclear whether\nsocieties are able to imagine their futures in ways analogous to those\nin which individuals imagine their futures.\n\nGeneral concepts and theories developed in other areas of social\nontology have the potential to shed further light on collective\nmemory. For example, the literature on\ncollective intentionality\n(Tollefsen 2006), may clarify the activity of joint reminiscing, which\nmight be understood as a form of joint attention to the past (Hoerl\n& McCormack 2005; Seemann forthcoming).\nBy providing a novel test case, collective memory also\nhas the potential to shed light on general concepts and theories in\nsocial ontology. For example, Smith (2014) has pointed out that,\nwhereas many social objects (institutions, contracts, and the like)\nare continuants, in the sense that they endure over time, the speech\nacts which, on many accounts, ground their existence, are events and\nhence exist only at a given moment in time. It is unclear how events\nmight ground the existence of continuants, and one potential solution\nto this problem is to ground the existence of social objects not in\nspeech acts but rather in forms of external memory, which are\nthemselves continuants (Ferraris [2010] 2013, 2015).\n9. The Epistemology of Memory\n\nIn addition to their implications for the metaphysics of memory,\nexternal and collective memory may have novel implications for\nepistemology (Carter & Kallestrup 2016; Clark 2015;\nMichaelian & Arango-Mu\u00f1oz\nforthcoming). Most research on the epistemology of memory, however,\nreflects the traditional concerns of individual epistemology, including\nthe viability with respect to memory knowledge of broad families of\nepistemological theories, such as internalism and externalism (Madison 2017),\nand of particular theories within those families, such as foundationalism\n(Senor 1993), coherentism (Olsson & Shogenji 2004),\nand reliabilism and virtue epistemology (Shanton 2011), as well as the\nrelevance to memory of issues such as scepticism (Baldwin 2001; Moon 2017)\nand epistemic circularity (Alston 1986). Other research on the epistemology of\nmemory tackles concerns specific to memory. As Frise (2015, Other\nInternet Resources) points out, there are unresolved debates over the\nproblem of forgotten evidence (Harman 1986), the problem of forgotten\ndefeat (A.I. Goldman 1999), and the problem of stored beliefs (Moon\n2012). There are also ongoing debates over the alleged analogy between\ntestimony and memory (Barnett 2015; Dummett 1994)\nand the question whether memory is a generative or a merely\npreservative source of knowledge (Frise forthcoming; Lackey 2005;\nMatthen 2010; Salvaggio forthcoming). Issues in the\nepistemology of memory, of course, interact with issues in the\nmetaphysics of memory, but, as there is\na separate entry on the epistemology\nof memory, these interactions will not be explored here in any detail.\n10. The Ethics of Memory\n\nThe ethics of memory is a relatively new area, but research in this\narea already concerns a number of distinct questions.\n10.1 Memory and moral responsibility\n\nThe research on remembering as mental time travel introduced above\nemphasizes the relationship between episodic memory and its\nfuture-oriented counterpart, episodic future thought, and there are\npotential links between mental time travel and moral\nresponsibility. Levy (2014; cf. Vierra 2016), for example, has\nargued that deficits in episodic memory and episodic future thought in\npsychopathy (Kennett & Matthews 2009; McIlwain 2010)\nimply that psychopaths cannot genuinely intend to harm others and that they\ntherefore may not have full moral responsibility for their actions.\nCraver et al. (2016), however, argue that subjects with deficits in\nepisodic memory and episodic future thought make moral judgements\nsimilar to those made by normal subjects, suggesting that more work\nneeds to be done to establish a definitive link between mental time\ntravel and moral responsibility.\n10.2 The duty to remember\n\nSome researchers have argued that we may have a moral duty to\nremember. Margalit (2002), for example, argues that we have a\nduty to remember the victims of radical evil. Such an\nobligation\u2014which, as Blustein (2008) points out,\nmight hold either at the individual or the collective\nlevel\u2014would be consistent with the spirit behind\ntruth and reconciliation commissions and similar institutions (Neumann\n& Thompson 2015). But the existence of a duty to\nremember is controversial, with some maintaining that there is no general\nduty to remember the past and even that there may in some cases be a duty\nto forget (Rieff 2016).\n10.3 The right to be forgotten\n\nOur increasing reliance on novel forms of external memory, may have\nsurprising ethical ramifications. The default for human memory is to\nforget, and most of the information that we encounter never makes its\nway into long-term memory. The default for computer memory, in\ncontrast, is to remember, and researchers are beginning to explore the\nethical implications of moving from a state of affairs in which\nforgetting is the norm, in the sense that one\u2019s\nwords and deeds would in general leave few permanent traces, to one in which\nremembering is the norm, in the sense that many of our words and deeds\nleave behind more or less permanent digital traces\n(Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger 2009). When remembering is the norm, people\nmay, in particular, be deprived of any opportunity for a fresh start\nafter engaging in inappropriate behaviours, leading some to argue for\na right to be forgotten (Ghezzi, Pereira, &\nVesnic-Alujevic 2014; J. Rosen 2012). From a legal and technological\npoint of view, such a right is likely to be difficult to implement.\nFrom a moral point of view, a right to be forgotten may imply a duty\nto forget, and it is unclear whether we can plausibly be held to have\nsuch a duty (Matheson 2013).\n10.4 The ethics of external memory\n\nNovel external memory technologies may ultimately reshape the norms\ngoverning individual remembering (Burkell 2016; O\u2019Hara 2013),\nbut even in the short term there are pressing ethical questions\nrelated to the impact of external memory technologies on\ncognition and the self. Regarding cognition, some have, as noted in\nsection 8, voiced unease about the cognitive impact of increasingly\nprevalent use of such technologies (Carr 2010). Others, however, are more\noptimistic (Bell & Gemmell 2009), and assessing the empirical\nevidence for optimistic and pessimistic claims about the cognitive\nimpact of external memory technologies is no easy matter (Heersmink\n2016; Loh & Kanai 2016). Regarding the self, Heersmink (2015,\nforthcoming) has argued that an extended mind perspective implies that there are\nstrict ethical constraints against interfering with individuals\u2019\nexternal memories (cf. N. Levy 2007). Clowes (2013, 2015), however,\nhas raised the possibility that the fact that internet-connected forms\nof external memory are often strongly influenced by agents other than\nthe individuals to whom they belong means that they do not count as\nparts of the relevant individuals\u2019 minds.\n10.5 The ethics of memory modification and enhancement\n\nWith the emergence of new techniques for altering the functioning of\nmemory systems\u2014for example, retrieval of a stored memory results\nin a period of reconsolidation during which the retrieved memory is\nlabile and susceptible to modification, potentially allowing\ninterventions to alter traumatic memories (Spiers & Bendor\n2014)\u2014ethical questions concerning various forms of memory\nmodification have become more pressing (Erler 2011; Hui &\nFisher 2015; N. Levy 2012; Liao & Wasserman 2007). Liao and\nSandberg (2008) identify a number of questions raised by memory\nmodification technologies; in light of the close relationship between\nmemory and the self noted above, it is no surprise that many of these\nconcern the effects of memory modification on the self. Modifying\nsomeone\u2019s memories may, for example, limit his self-knowledge by\ndepriving him of opportunities to learn about his own actions or erode\nhis sense of agency by depriving him of the possibility of viewing\nhimself as an agent with respect to events in which he was involved.\nNevertheless, Liao and Sandberg argue that, in certain cases, the\nbenefits of memory modification may outweigh its costs, so that there\nneed be no general ethical barrier to the use of emerging memory\nmodification technologies. Much of the debate so far has focussed on\nthe suppression of traumatic or otherwise undesirable memories, but\nparallel questions are raised by the use of novel methods for the\nenhancement of memory abilities by pharmaceutical and other\nmeans (Bostrom & Sandberg 2009). Critics of the memory\nenhancement debate, however, have argued that the evidence for the efficacy of\nthe relevant methods is mixed (Zohny 2015) or that the debate often\noverlooks important differences among kinds of memory (Fox, Fitz,\n& Reiner forthcoming).",
