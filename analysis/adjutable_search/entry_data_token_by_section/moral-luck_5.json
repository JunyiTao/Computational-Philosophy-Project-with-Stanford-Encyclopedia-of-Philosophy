    "main_text": "Responding to the Problem: Three Approaches || Acceptance\n4.2 Acceptance\n\nAll of those who accept the existence of some type of moral luck\nreject the Control Principle and the Kantian conception of morality\nthat embraces it. As a result, they must either explain how we can\nrevise our moral judgments and practices in a coherent way or show\nthat we are not committed to the Control Principle in the first\nplace.\n4.2.1 Accepting Moral Luck and Revising our Practices\n\nSome who accept luck argue that doing so requires a significant change\nin our moral practices. Browne (1992), for example, suggests that if\nthe Control Principle is false, we ought not to respond to an\nagent\u2019s wrongdoing with anger and blame that is\n\u201cagainst\u201d him, but rather with anger that does not include\nhostility or the desire to punish. Nevertheless, we can still respond\nto the successful murderer with more of the \u201cright\u201d kind\nof anger than we feel toward the unsuccessful one. One question that\nmight be raised here is whether we are left with enough of our\nordinary conception of morality to include genuine notions of blame\nand responsibility.\n4.2.2 Accepting Moral Luck Without (As Much) Revision\n\nOthers suggest that the Control Principle does not have nearly the\nhold on us that Nagel and Williams assume, and that rejecting it would\nnot change our practices in a significant way. Among these are some\nwho focus on the free will debate and others who take on the broader\nproblem of moral luck directly.\n4.2.2.1 Accepting Moral Luck and the Free Will Debate\n\nA large group who accept moral luck do not explicitly address the\nproblem of moral luck as so formulated because they focus on what\nNagel identifies as a narrower issue, namely, that of free will. One\ntraditional problem of free will is posed by the following line of\nreasoning: if determinism is true, then no one can act freely, and,\nassuming that freedom is necessary for responsibility, no one can be\nresponsible for their actions. Compatibilists have argued that we can\nact freely and responsibly even if determinism is true. Since most do\nnot adopt Zimmerman\u2019s radical account of moral assessment in\nwhich one can be responsible despite not being responsible\nfor anything, they admit the existence of causal moral luck.\nIf, as some have argued, causal luck is exhausted by constitutive and\ncircumstantial luck, then they also accept that there can be these\nsorts of moral luck, as well.\n\nA basic compatibilist strategy is to argue that agents can have\ncontrol over their actions in the sense required for freedom and/or\nresponsibility even if they do not control the causal determinants of\nthose actions. For example, if one acts with the ability to act in\naccordance with good reasons (Wolf 1990) or if one acts with\n\u201cguidance control\u201d which consists in part of acting on a\nreasons-responsive mechanism for which one has taken responsibility,\n(Fischer and Ravizza 1998), one can be responsible for one\u2019s\nactions. The key move here is to distinguish between different kinds\nof factors over which one has no control. If one\u2019s actions are\ncaused by factors that one does not control and that prevent one from\nhaving or exercising certain capacities, then one is not responsible.\nHowever, if one\u2019s actions are caused by factors that one does\nnot control, but that do allow one to have and exercise the relevant\ncapacities, then one can be \u201cin control\u201d of one\u2019s\nactions in the relevant sense, and so responsible for one\u2019s\nactions.\n\nInterestingly, compatibilists are often silent on the question of\nresultant and circumstantial moral luck, although these forms of luck\nmight represent an underutilized resource for them. For if it turns\nout that the luck\u2014or lack of control\u2014delivered by\ndeterminism is but one source of luck among others, then determinism\ndoes not embody a unique obstacle to free will and responsibility, at\nleast when it comes to control. This is to expand the application of a\nwidely used compatibilist strategy to show that when it comes to\ncausal luck, compatibilists are not alone.\n\nFor within the free will debate, compatibilists are not alone in\naccepting the existence of certain types of luck. Many libertarians\nassume that our actions are caused by prior events (not themselves in\nour control) in accordance with probabilistic laws of nature (see, for\nexample, Kane 1996, 1999, Nozick 1981). Given this view, it is natural\nto conclude that if determinism is false, there is at least one kind\nof luck in what sort of person one decides to be and so in what\nactions one performs. That is, there is luck in the sense that there\nis no explanation as to why a person chose to be one way rather than\nanother. At the same time, Kane, for example, denies that there must\nbe luck in the sense that one\u2019s choices are flukes or accidents\nif determinism is false. In Kane\u2019s view, what is important is to\nbe free from luck of the second kind. For even if one\u2019s action\nis not determined, it can still be the case that the causes of\none\u2019s action are one\u2019s own efforts and intention. And if\none\u2019s action is caused by one\u2019s own efforts and\nintentions, then one\u2019s action is not lucky in the sense of being\na fluke or accident. But while this shows that one\u2019s actions can\nbe free of luck of an important kind, it still leaves unaddressed luck\nof a third kind, namely the kind at issue in the moral luck debate:\nthe dependence of agents\u2019 choices on factors beyond their\ncontrol. And it appears that on the libertarian view in question, our\nchoices are indeed subject to luck of this sort. (See Pereboom 2002\nand 2014 for a discussion of the similar burdens shared by\ncompatibilists and this sort of libertarian.) Only the agent-causal\nlibertarians discussed above offer an account that aims specifically\nat eliminating a type of moral luck. (See Levy 2011 for an argument\nthat no account of free will can avoid challenges concerning\nluck.)\n4.2.2.2 Accepting Moral Luck and Distinctive Conceptions of Morality\n\nIt is also possible to argue that we are not committed to the Control\nPrinciple by taking on the problem of moral luck directly.\n\nOne strategy is to argue that moral luck is only a problem for an\noverly idealized conception of human agency. But once we adopt a\nrealistic conception of human agency, the problem evaporates. Margaret\nUrban Walker (1991) argues in this vein that moral luck is only\nproblematic for a conception of moral agents as \u201cnoumenal\u201d\nor pure (238). In contrast, adopting a conception of morality that\napplies to human beings in all of their impurity will not be\nthreatened by moral luck. According to Walker, the Control Principle\nis far from obvious, and we would not want to live in a world in which\nit held sway. The argument appears to rest on the idea that without\nmoral luck, we would lack several virtues that allow us to help each\nother in most essential ways. Our very reactions to moral luck can be\nvirtuous. For example, by accepting that our \u201cresponsibilities\noutrun control,\u201d we are able to display the virtue of\ndependability by accepting that we will be there for our friends, even\nif their needs are not in our control. In contrast, pure agents who\nare only responsible for what they control \u201cmay not be depended\non, much less morally required, to assume a share of the ongoing and\nmassive human work of caring, healing, restoring, and cleaning-up on\nwhich each separate life and the collective one depend.\u201d (247).\nThus, if we focus on our actual moral commitments, we will see that\nthe Control Principle is neither attractive nor necessary for\nmorality.\n\nIt is not obvious that a world in which people denied the existence of\nmoral luck would be as bleak as the one Walker envisions. Moral luck\nskeptics have material with which to question Walker\u2019s claim.\nFor example, those who deny resultant moral luck can still agree that\nagents have an obligation to minimize their risks of doing harm, and\nthose who deny circumstantial moral luck can still agree that agents\nhave an obligation to cultivate qualities that prepare them to act\nwell in whatever circumstances arise.\n\nA second strategy for rejecting the Control Principle turns\nNagel\u2019s argument on its head by taking as a starting point\nordinary judgments and reactions that reveal our implicit rejection of\nthe Control Principle. Adams (1985) adopts this strategy, drawing our\nattention to common practices, such as blaming people for their racist\nattitudes even if we do not think that such people are in control of\ntheir attitudes. Since Adams focuses primarily on agents\u2019 states\nof mind that have intentional objects such as anger and\nself-righteousness, it is possible to see him as accepting the\nexistence of constitutive moral luck in particular. But it is also\npossible to adopt the same sort of strategy for other sorts of luck,\nincluding resultant luck. Moore (1997 and 2009), for example, points\nto the fact that we resent those who succeed in causing harm more than\nthose who do not, we feel greater guilt when we ourselves cause harm,\nand when we face decisions, we feel that the consequences of matter to\nthe moral quality of our choices. According to Moore, the best\nexplanation of these reactive attitudes, such as guilt and resentment,\nis that their objects are genuinely more blameworthy.\n\nNow opponents who deny the existence of moral luck have ways of\nexplaining away these phenomena. When it comes to cases of\nconstitutive luck, like the case of the racist, they can say that we\nconfuse agents\u2019 blameworthiness for their character and\nattitudes with blameworthiness for their actions that manifest these\noffending attitudes and for their failure to take steps to eliminate\nthem. On reflection, we can see that we ought to blame the racists\nonly for their actions or omissions, not for the attitudes themselves\nover which they have no control. Similarly, as we saw earlier, when it\ncomes to resultant luck, moral luck skeptics have a variety of strong\nalternative explanations of our judgments and emotional responses. It\nis possible that there is a disagreement here at the level of\nintuitions: some find it easier on reflection to reject moral\njudgments that depend on results than others. Further, those accepting\nresultant moral luck face a challenge of articulating a positive\ntheory of how exactly results affect one\u2019s moral status while at\nthe same time accounting for our intuitions. Sverdlik (1988) argues\nthat it is not obvious how such a challenge can be met.\n\nAt this point in the debate, those who accept moral luck offer\nordinary judgments and responses in their defense, while moral luck\nskeptics offer alternative explanations of those practices and hold up\nthe Control Principle itself, together with other reflective intuitive\njudgments, as reason to reject moral luck. We seem to have something\nof a stalemate. So it is no surprise that those who accept moral luck\ntend not to rely exclusively on ordinary judgments to make their case,\nbut rather go on to try to undermine the Control Principle in other\nways.\n\nAnother way of trying to undermine the appeal of the Control Principle\nitself is to show how it might be mistaken for something else that is\nmore plausible. For example, Adams (1985) recognizes that there are\nlimits to what we can be responsible for, and writes that the states\nof mind \u201cfor which we are directly responsible are those in\nwhich we are responding, consciously or unconsciously, to data that\nare rich enough to permit a fairly adequate ethical appreciation of\nthe state\u2019s intentional object and of the object\u2019s place\nin the fabric of personal relationships\u201d (26). Thus, according\nto Adams\u2019 conception of morality, adherents of the Control\nPrinciple are correct in an important respect, namely, in their\nunderstanding that what one is responsible for springs in the right\nway from oneself. But this requirement is more general than a\nstrict requirement of control, and although easily confused with the\nControl Principle, is superior to it, on this view.\n\nAdopting the same general strategy, Moore (1997) identifies still\nother principles with which the Control Principle might be confused.\nHe points out that when we use the word \u201cluck\u201d in the\ncontext of moral assessment, we tend not to mean that the\nperson lacked control over what he did, but rather that what happened\nwas far off of \u201csome moral baseline of the normal\u201d (213).\nFor example, consider two would-be murderers, one of whom fires his\ngun and hits his target, and the other of whom fires in the same way,\nfrom the same distance, and so on, but whose bullet is deflected by an\nunexpected and unusually strong wind. Moore suggests that the first\ngunman is not \u201clucky\u201d in the ordinary sense, even though\nit is true that whether a hurricane-force wind arose or not was not in\nhis control. According to Moore, there is something intuitively right\nabout morality being immune to luck, but only if we understand\n\u201cluck\u201d in the sense of \u201cfreakishness.\u201d\nFurther, the successful murderer is \u201cin control\u201d\nof his action in the normal sense of the word \u201ccontrol,\u201d\neven though he doesn\u2019t control the wind. Thus, while we do care\nabout luck and control in making both moral and legal assessments,\nthey aren\u2019t Nagel\u2019s concepts, on this view. Thus,\naccording to Moore, there is no contradiction in our everyday\ncommitments.\n\nNow those who think we are naturally drawn to the Control Principle\ncan respond by pointing out both the intuitive plausibility of the\nprinciple in the abstract and the cases described earlier that seem to\nsupport it. They might also accept that Adams and Moore have pointed\nout further necessary conditions for responsibility, while still\nmaintaining that the Control Principle is true. Again, differing\nintuitions about cases and about the Control Principle have the\npotential to make a big difference to one\u2019s view at this\npoint.\n\nMichael Otsuka offers yet another principle in place of the Control\nPrinciple: One is only blameworthy in cases in which one had the kind\nof control that would have allowed one to be entirely blameless.\nConsistent with this is a kind of moral luck, however:\none\u2019s blameworthiness can vary in degree as a function of\nharm done, where harm done may be affected by what is not in\none\u2019s control. Although one cannot be blameworthy if one lacked\nthe control necessary to avoid blameworthiness, one\u2019s\ndegree of blameworthiness can increase if the risk one takes\ncomes out badly due to circumstances one could do nothing to avoid.\nFor example, in the case of the two assassins, both are blameworthy,\nbut, Otsuka argues, the one who hits and kills his target is more\nblameworthy. In sketching the view, Otsuka draws a parallel with\nDworkin\u2019s (1981) treatment of option luck in the debate over\negalitarianism. In that debate, a distinction is drawn between option\nluck (\u201ca matter of ...whether someone gains or loses through\naccepting an isolated risk he or she should have anticipated and might\nhave declined\u201d) and brute luck (\u201ca matter of how risks\nfall out that are not that sense...gambles).\u201d If one\u2019s\nluck is just brute-one did not assume a risk, as when one has done\neverything a careful driver would do, and due to sheer luck, a dog\nruns into the street and one drives over it-one is not blameworthy.\nBut if one assumes a risk by knowingly and freely driving recklessly,\nand, as a result, one kills a dog, then one is blameworthy. And,\nfurther, one might be more blameworthy in the case in which one kills\nthe dog than in the case in which one takes the same risk but luckily\nreaches home without hitting anything. It would be reasonable, on\nOtsuka\u2019s view, for the dog owner whose dog is killed to be more\nresentful than the one whose dog escapes, and this supports the\nconclusion that the driver who kills the dog is more blameworthy than\nthe one who does not. \n\nThe parallel to option and brute luck is suggestive, but a defender of\nthe unqualified Control principle has resources here. Appealing to the\ndistinction between scope and degree, one might grant that the\nreckless driver is, importantly, responsible for more things\n(including a death), but not more blameworthy. In fact, the parallel\nto the treatment of option luck in the debate about distributive\njustice may fit best if we are interested in what we are responsible\nfor, rather than how responsible we are. Further, we have seen\nreason to think that on reflection we should not blame one reckless\ndriver more than another. One might question Otsuka\u2019s premise\nthat degree of blameworthiness is to be understood in terms of\nappropriate degree of attitudes such as resentment (or even the weaker\npremise that the degree of blameworthiness tracks the appropriate\ndegree of such attitudes). But even if we accept this premise, we\nmight conclude that while it is understandable that one dog owner\nwould be more resentful than the first, more resentment is not\nactually justified. This observation takes us back to the subtle\nnature of the dialectic. \n\nIn adjudicating this debate between those defending the Control\nPrinciple and those defending alternative principles, we can ask just\nhow much weight should be given to our natural reactions to cases,\nand, in particular, to our reactive attitudes, such as resentment and\nguilt. At least in some cases, these can be tempered when we reflect\nexplicitly on key features of cases, and our initial responses can be\nrevised in light of these reflections, together with reflection on\ngeneral principles.\n\nNotably, there has recently been an attempt by philosophers to appeal\nto results from empirical psychology to explain away some set of\nintuitions or other, and this strategy has been applied in the area of\nmoral luck in particular. For some examples, see Domsky (2004) and\nRoyzman and Kumar (2004) whose explanations in different ways support\nthe preservation of our adherence to the Control Principle, and see\nEnoch and Guttel (2010) for a reply to both. Psychologists and\nexperimental philosophers have also simply tried to offer explanations\nof our intuitions, particularly of ones that appear to conflict as we\nfind in the debate about moral luck. For example, see Cushman and\nGreen (2012), who offer an explanation of apparently conflicting\nintuitions about moral results luck in terms of two dissociable\nprocesses, and Bj\u00f6rnsson and Persson (2012), who offer an\nexplanation in terms of shifting explanatory perspectives. In an\ninteresting set of studies, Kneer and Machery (2019) found that when\nparticipants were asked for comparative judgments about pairs of\nscenarios, varying only in outcome, they tended to offer anti-moral\nluck responses, judging agents in both scenarios equally blameworthy.\nIn contrast, in related studies in which each participant only saw one\nscenario without a comparison, participants\u2019 judgments of\ndegrees of blameworthiness varied by scenario, with the more harmful\noutcome scenarios receiving judgments of higher degrees of blame.\nHowever, Kneer and Machinery found that the differences in judgments\nin these cases was nearly entirely mediated by a disproportionate\nattribution of negligence to the agents in the harmful scenarios,\nsuggesting the possibility that, when presented only with one\nscenario, participants read backwards from harm to a morally\nsignificant attribution of features in the agents. If this is correct,\nthen it may not be outcome per se that provides the grounds of\ndifferential judgments, but, rather, a distinct morally salient\nfeature of agents that is often associated with outcome. Taken\ntogether, Kneer and Machery\u2019s studies support the idea that\npeople have anti-results-luck intuitions and lay theories, and that\nwhere they appear to have pro-results-luck intuitions, these can be\nexplained as people tracking something only contingently associated\nwith outcome rather than outcome itself. It is worth noting, however,\nas several of these authors do themselves, that even if we were\nconfident in our possession of psychological explanations of our\nintuitions, there would still be philosophical work to do to sort out\nwhat the normative facts are. But it is helpful to have a growing body\nof systematic studies of intuitive reactions to scenarios involving\nmoral luck, as well as investigation into the features of cases people\nfind salient.\n\nThere is a final argument in favor of the acceptance of moral luck of\na very different kind that might ultimately help decide the issue in\none direction or the other. It explicitly encompasses every kind of\nluck and thus poses a deep and difficult challenge to moral luck\nskeptics, particularly the large group who focus exclusively on\nresultant luck. The main idea is that rejecting resultant luck, but\nnot other sorts of luck, is an unstable position (e.g., Moore 1997 and\nHartman 2017). In a nutshell, one cannot find a principled place to\ndraw the line at refusing to accept moral luck. In effect, this\nargument is Nagel\u2019s argument in reverse. Begin by observing that\nwe lack control over everything: the results of our actions, our\ncircumstances, our constitution, and our causal history. If we are to\navoid moral skepticism, then we must accept moral luck in some areas,\nand if we do that, then we ought to accept it in the area of results.\nParticularly if we accept that we are not predisposed to accept the\nControl Principle in the first place, then we ought to accept luck in\nall areas, thereby avoiding moral skepticism.\n\nHartman (2017) offers a version of this strategy that is explicitly\nanalogical (pp. 105\u201307). Consider three agents who all form the\nintention and plan to carry out a murder. Each has a single\nopportunity to pull the trigger of a gun. Sneezy sneezes and so is\nunable to pull the trigger; Off-Target pulls the trigger, but the\nbullet is intercepted by a bird, and Bulls-Eye pulls the trigger and\nhits her target. By hypothesis, there is circumstantial luck, so,\nclaims Hartman, Sneezy is less blameworthy than Off-Target, even\nthough she would have pulled the trigger had her allergies not acted\nup. But given the parallels between Sneezy and Off-Target (same\nintentions, plans, and so on) are similar to the parallels between\nOff-Target and Bulls-Eye, we have analogical evidence that Off-Target\nis less blameworthy than Bulls-Eye. \n\nThere are a variety of possible replies, such as that offered by\nRivera-L\u00f3pez (2016), which claims that there is a principled\ndifference resting on the need to make moral attributions at all. We\nshould accept moral luck where it is necessary for making the practice\nof attributing responsibility possible, but given that it is necessary\nin the case of circumstantial luck and not in the case of results\nluck, we can draw a principled line between the two pairs of cases.\nHartman takes it that what is really needed here is that we ought to\naccept moral luck only if it is needed for our practices of\nattribution, but also suggest that it that this begs the question in\nthe context at least without further defense. Another reply is that\naccepting circumstantial luck does not require accepting that it makes\na difference everywhere, and that indeed Sneezy and Off-Target are\nthemselves equally blameworthy. Thus, the analogical argument does not\nget off the ground with this set of cases. And yet if we turn to a\ndifferent set of cases, such as the case of Jenny described earlier,\nwho lives in a utopian world but would have collaborated with the\nNazis, where the intuition of differential degrees of blameworthiness\nis stronger, the analogy becomes much weaker. Nevertheless, the\ngeneral line of argument poses a challenge for anyone who wishes to\ndraw a line, accepting some kinds of moral luck and not others. \n\nNow even if no one has adequately defended a way of drawing a line\nbetween different sorts of luck, it is not obvious that the door has\nbeen closed on all future attempts. Thus, one way of seeing this\nargument is as a shift-the-burden one. Those who wish to draw a line\nbetween different sorts of moral luck must offer a deeper rationale\nfor doing so than has yet been offered. \n4.3 Incoherence\n\nAccording to this approach, it is simply incoherent to accept\nor deny the existence of some type(s) of moral luck. This\napproach has been used for constitutive luck in particular.\n\nAmong those who wish to preserve the centrality of morality in our\nlives, many have appealed to an idea formulated by Nicholas Rescher\n(1993), according to which \u201c[o]ne cannot meaningfully said to be\nlucky in regard to who one is, but only with respect to what happens\nto one. Identity must precede luck\u201d (155). It is easy to take\nRescher\u2019s point out of context without realizing that he is\nworking with a notion of luck that differs from the notion of\n\u201clack of control.\u201d According to Rescher, something is\nlucky if (i) it came about \u201cby accident\u201d where this seems\nto mean something like \u201cunplanned\u201d or\n\u201cunexpected\u201d or \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d and (ii)\nthe outcome \u201chas a significantly evaluative status in\nrepresenting a good or bad result, a benefit or loss\u201d(145).\nTaken this way, it does seem at least very odd to say that one\u2019s\nidentity is (or is not) a matter of luck. But it is less clear that\nthere is anything odd\u2014let alone incoherent\u2014about saying\nthat one\u2019s identity is not a matter within one\u2019s\ncontrol.\n\nCould there nevertheless be some truth to Rescher\u2019s claim even\nif we understand \u201cluck\u201d as \u201cout of one\u2019s\ncontrol?\u201d Perhaps it does not make sense, for example, to say\nthat a person is in control of who she is. For one could argue that\nthis would amount to saying that a person is a self-creator. And in\nfact the Control Principle, taken to its logical extreme, seems to\nlead to just such a requirement (see, e.g., Browne 1992, Nagel 1986,\n118). If it turns out that self-creation is conceptually impossible as\nmany argue (e.g., Galen Strawson 1986), then perhaps there is a sense\nin which it is right to say that being in control of one\u2019s\nconstitution makes no sense. But it does not follow from this that it\nis meaningless to deny that one can control one\u2019s\nconstitution.\n\nPerhaps the best way of deploying the insight that there is something\nspecial about luck and constitution is not to say that it is\nmeaningless to discuss it, but to say that constitutive moral luck is\nsimply unproblematic for morality in the way that resultant moral luck\nis. This would be to take up the \u201cline-drawing\u201d challenge\nas described in the last section. On this line of reasoning, for\npurposes of moral assessment, it does not matter how you came to be;\nwhat matters is what you do with what you are. Of course, as we saw,\nthis requires defense and explanation, but it is a way of capturing\nthe insight that constitutive luck is relevantly different from the\nresultant luck that has captivated a number of commentators.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe problem of moral luck is deeply unsettling. Naturally, there is a\nwide variety of responses to it. On the one extreme are those who deny\nthat there is any sort of moral luck, and on the other are those who\naccept every sort of moral luck. Most writers who have responded to\nthe problem fall somewhere in between; either they explicitly take a\nmixed approach or they confine their arguments to a carefully\ndelineated subset of types of moral luck while remaining uncommitted\nwith respect to the others. The extreme positions are vulnerable to\nthe objection that they have left some consideration or other\ncompletely unaccounted for. But those who occupy the middle also face\na formidable challenge: where can one draw a principled line between\nacceptable and unacceptable forms of luck? As we have seen, one\napparently natural place to draw a line is between resultant luck and\nall of the other sorts. On this view, there is no resultant moral\nluck, despite initial appearances, although there is moral luck of all\nthe other kinds. Thus, occupiers of this position face the challenge\nof setting out a plausible rationale for drawing the line where they\ndo. But they also face the challenge of where precisely to draw\nanother line, namely, the line around what counts as\n\u201cresults.\u201d For we can ask on which side of this line do\nintentions, willings, bodily movements, and so on, fall. Do results\ninclude everything that happens after the formation of an intention or\nthe exertion of the will, for example? Or everything that follows the\nbeginning of the formation of an intention or the\nbeginning of the exertion of the will? Or everything that\nfollows the \u201caffection of the heart\u201d of which Adam Smith\nwrote so eloquently? These are difficult questions for those who would\ndraw a line at resultant luck. But difficult questions await every\nother proposal, too. Fortunately, there is a rich and growing\nliterature providing a full spectrum of responses to explore.",
