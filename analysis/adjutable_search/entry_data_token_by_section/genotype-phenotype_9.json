For example,\nthe eyes of fruit flies, normally red, are sometimes white.\nGeneticists identified the location on the chromosomes that\ncorresponds to the white-eye mutation (Morgan 1919) and later\ninvestigated the pigment-formation metabolic pathway and the enzymes\n(proteins that modulate biochemical interactions) involved as fruit\nfly eyes develop the normal or mutant color (e.g., Beadle &\nEphrussi 1936). Research since World War II that came to be known as\nmolecular genetics or molecular biology went on to\nidentify DNA as the chemical basis of genes and the mechanisms of DNA\nreplication, mutation, transcription to RNA, and translation to\npolypeptides (components of proteins). Researchers probed the feedback\nnetworks that regulate these mechanisms, first in viruses and\nbacteria, then in complex, multicellular organisms; mapped and\nmodified the specific DNA sequence of organisms; compared sequences\namong taxonomic groups (i.e., groups in different branches of\nthe classification of life) so as to assess the degree of genetic\nvariation in populations and to classify taxonomic groups into\nphylogenies; traced where and when in development specific genes are\nactive; and examined the role of DNA sequences not associated with\ngenes (Griffiths & Stotz 2013). Such research, which now occupies\nthe center of biology, renders it plausible to many researchers and\ncommentators that development of traits will eventually be understood\nin terms of a composite of the influences on the organism over time of\nidentified DNA variants (see entry on\n gene).\n",
