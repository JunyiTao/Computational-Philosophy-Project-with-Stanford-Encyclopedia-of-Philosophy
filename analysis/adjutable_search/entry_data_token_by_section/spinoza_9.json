    "main_text": "Theological-Political Treatise || On Religion and Scripture\n3.2 The State\n\nSpinoza\u2019s account of religion has clear political ramifications.\nThere had always been a quasi-political agenda behind his decision to\nwrite the TTP, since his attack was directed at political meddling by\nreligious authorities. But he also took the opportunity to give a more\ndetailed and thorough presentation of a general theory of the state\nthat is only sketchily present in the Ethics. Such an\nexamination of the true nature of political society is particularly\nimportant to his argument for intellectual and religious freedom,\nsince he must show that such freedom is not only compatible with\npolitical well-being, but essential to it.\n\nThe individual egoism of the Ethics plays itself out in a\npre-political context\u2014the so-called \u201cstate of\nnature\u201d, a universal condition where there is no law or religion\nor justice and injustice\u2014as the right of every individual to do\nwhatever he can to preserve himself. \u201cWhatever every person,\nwhenever he is considered as solely under the dominion of Nature,\nbelieves to be to his advantage, whether under the guidance of sound\nreason or under passion\u2019s sway, he may by sovereign natural\nright seek and get for himself by any means, by force, deceit,\nentreaty, or in any other way he best can, and he may consequently\nregard as his enemy anyone who tries to hinder him from getting what\nhe wants\u201d (TTP, chap. 16, G III.190/S 174). Naturally, this is a\nrather insecure and dangerous condition under which to live. In\nHobbes\u2019 celebrated phrase\u2014and Spinoza was clearly\ninfluenced by his reading of that British thinker\u2014life in the\nstate of nature is \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish and\nshort\u201d. As rational creatures, we soon realize that we would be\nbetter off, still from a thoroughly egoistic perspective, coming to an\nagreement among ourselves to restrain our opposing desires and the\nunbounded pursuit of self-interest\u2014in sum, that it would be in\nour greater self-interest to live under the law of reason rather than\nthe law of nature. We thus agree to hand over to a sovereign our\nnatural right and power to do whatever we can to satisfy our\ninterests. That sovereign\u2014whether it be an individual (in which\ncase the resulting state is a monarchy), a small group of individuals\n(an oligarchy) or the body-politic as a whole (a democracy)\u2014will\nbe absolute and unrestrained in the scope of its powers. It will be\ncharged with keeping all the members of society to the agreement,\nmostly by playing on their fear of the consequences of breaking the\n\u201csocial contract\u201d.\n\nObedience to the sovereign does not infringe upon our autonomy, since\nin following the commands of the sovereign we are following an\nauthority whom we have freely authorized and whose commands have no\nother object than our own rational self- interest. The type of\ngovernment most likely to respect and preserve that autonomy, issue\nlaws based on sound reason and to serve the ends for which government\nis instituted is democracy. It is the \u201cmost natural\u201d form\nof governing arising out of a social contract\u2014since in a\ndemocracy the people obey only laws that issue from the general will\nof the body politic\u2014and the least subject to various abuses of\npower. In a democracy, the rationality of the sovereign\u2019s\ncommands is practically secured, since it is unlikely that a majority\nof a large number of people will agree to an irrational design.\nMonarchy, on the other hand, is the least stable form of government\nand the one most likely to degenerate into tyranny.\n\nSince the outward practices of religion impinge upon the comportment\nand relations of citizens, they fall under \u201cstate\nbusiness\u201d and, thus, within the sphere of the sovereign\u2019s\npower. The sovereign should have complete dominion in all public\nmatters secular and spiritual. There should be no church separate from\nthe religion instituted and regulated by the state. This will prevent\nsectarianism and the multiplication of religious disputes. All\nquestions concerning external religious rites and ceremonies are in\nthe hands of the sovereign. This is in the best interest of everyone,\nsince the sovereign will, ideally and in conformity with its\n\u201ccontractual\u201d duty, insure that such practices are in\naccord with public peace and safety and social well-being. The\nsovereign should rule in such a way that his commands enforce\nGod\u2019s law. Justice and charity thereby acquire the force of\ncivil law, backed by the power of the sovereign. (For this reason, it\nis misleading to proclaim Spinoza as a proponent of the separation of\nchurch and state.)\n\nOn the other hand, dominion over the \u201cinward worship of\nGod\u201d and the beliefs accompanying it\u2014in other words, inner\npiety\u2014belongs exclusively to the individual. This is a matter of\ninalienable, private right, and it cannot be legislated, not even by\nthe sovereign. No one can limit or control another person\u2019s\nthoughts anyway, and it would be foolhardy and destructive to the\npolity for a sovereign to attempt to do so. Nor can speech ever truly\nand effectively be controlled, since people will always say want they\nwant, at least in private. \u201cEveryone is by absolute natural\nright the master of his own thoughts, and thus utter failure will\nattend any attempt in a commonwealth to force men to speak only as\nprescribed by the sovereign despite their different and opposing\nopinions\u201d (TTP, chap. 20, G III.240/S 223). There must, Spinoza\ngrants, be some limits to speech and teaching. Seditious\ndiscourse that encourages individuals to nullify the social contract\nshould not be tolerated. But the best government will err on the side\nof leniency and allow the freedom of philosophical speculation and the\nfreedom of religious belief. Certain \u201cinconveniences\u201d\nwill, no doubt, sometimes result from such an extensive liberty. But\nthe attempt to regulate everything by law is \u201cmore likely to\narouse vices than to reform them\u201d. In a passage that foreshadows\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s utilitarian defense of liberty nearly two\ncenturies later, Spinoza adds that \u201cthis freedom is of the first\nimportance in fostering the sciences and the arts, for only those\nwhose judgment is free and unbiased can attain success in these\nfields\u201d (TTP, chap. 20, G III.243/S 226).\n\nIt is hard to imagine a more passionate and reasoned defense of\nfreedom and toleration than that offered by Spinoza.\n",
