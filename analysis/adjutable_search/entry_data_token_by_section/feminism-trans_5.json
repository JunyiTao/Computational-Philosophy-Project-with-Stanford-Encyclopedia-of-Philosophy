    "main_text": "The Empire Strikes Back || Cyborg and Mestiza\n4.2 Cyborg and Mestiza\n\n\nStone's manifesto relies on an account of\noppression/resistance that breaks sharply from the utopian vision found\nin Raymond's work. Instead, it draws largely on the ideas of\nHaraway's \u201cA Cyborg Manifesto\u201d (1983, 1991) and\nGloria Anzald\u00faa's theory of the mestiza (1987). It will be\nworth discussing these views briefly to draw out the nature of\nStone's theoretical departure from Raymond.\n\n\nHaraway's postmodern image of the cyborg (explained below) is\nintended to raise worries, derived largely from writings of women of\ncolor, about single, monolithic (identity-based) accounts of\noppression/liberation. Haraway worries about political accounts which\npostulate an original state of innocence and subsequent fall from grace\nand which then envision a utopian future which promises a return to\ninnocence.\n\n\nAccording to Haraway, the difficulty with such theories is that they\nare partial in their account of the world (while assuming universality)\nand so end up ignoring (and even promoting) certain forms of oppression\n(1991, 156). For example, a feminist vision which posits a shared\nexperience of oppression among women and recommends lesbian-separatism\nas its solution, as formulated, leaves out the experience of racial\noppression among women of color (Combahee River Collective 1981). Why\nshould women of color be expected to forego solidarity with progressive\nmen of color?\n\n\nThe cyborg, then, is a collection of disparate, incongruent parts:\nEach individual contains multiple elements of oppressor and oppressed.\nAs a metaphor, it is intended to refuse postulations of original\ninnocence and utopian future (1991, 151). Instead, resistance for\nHaraway is possible due only to the possibility of the cyborg's\nturning against the intentions of its maker in a dystopian environment\n(151). This idea is notably taken up by Susan Stryker (1994), who uses\nthe metaphor of Frankenstein's monster, in her reply to Mary\nDaly's (1978) representation of transsexuals as monstrous\nboundary violators.\n\n\nThis notion of mixture is also central in the work of\nAnzald\u00faa, who speaks against an emphasis on purity and in favor\nof the notion of mixed race (una raza mestiza) (1987, 99). She\nrecognizes herself as a border dweller, torn between the demands of\nconflicting cultures (for example, anglo and Mexican) (1987, 100). The\nexperience of being caught in the confluence of multiple cultures leads\nto a kind of multiplicity or fragmentation of self. For example, one\nmight be represented in a racist manner in dominant white forms of\nfeminism and in a sexist manner in dominant forms of racial resistance.\nThis tension between conflicting cultural perspectives yields the\npossibility of \u201cdouble\u201d or \u201cMestiza\u201d\nconsciousness which involves the capacity to see oneself in accordance\nwith the dominant ways in which one is oppressively represented and\nconstrained in different, and often conflicting ways (101\u20132).\n\n\nIt is precisely the capacity to be conscious of this plurality of\nthe self, in Anzald\u00faa's view, that allows for resistance,\nsince there is an awareness which outstrips the multiple forms of\noppression by viewing them together, as well as in conflict (1987,\n102). Such a consciousness also allows for the possibility of\n\u201clinguistic terrorism\u201d\u2014the creative blending of\ndisparate languages and cultures in ways that work against the\nmonolithic character of each (1987, 75\u201386). For example, Chicano Texas\nSpanish and Tex-Mex involve such a linguistic blending.\nAnzald\u00faa writes, \u201cUntil I am free to write bilingually and\nto switch codes without having always to translate \u2026 my tongue\nwill be illegitimate\u201d (81). And: \u201cWe are your linguistic\nnightmare, your linguistic aberration, your linguistic\nmestizaje \u2026\u201d (80).\n\n\nWhile neither Haraway nor Anzald\u00faa explicitly discuss\nRaymond, it is clear that the position articulated in the\nThe Transsexual Empire is vulnerable to their concerns.\nRaymond's vision provides both an origin account as well as the\npromise of salvation: The original imposition of sex roles and the\nfinal achievement of integrity through freedom from them\n(1979, 164). And Raymond's dismissal of integration (the\nmish-mash of incongruent parts) is precisely celebrated by Haraway and\nAnzald\u00faa, who have no patience for the alleged\n\u201cinnocence\u201d and \u201cpurity\u201d of integrity.\nSignificantly, Anzald\u00faa identifies a state between man and woman\nas a site for creative resistance:\n\n\nThere is something compelling about being both male and female,\nabout having an entry into both worlds. Contrary to some psychiatric\ntenets, half and halfs are not suffering from a confusion of sexual\nidentity, or even from a confusion of gender. What we are suffering\nfrom is an absolute despot duality that says we are able to be only one\nor the other (1987, 41).\n\n\nAlthough Stone does not explicitly use the expression \u201cdouble\nconsciousness\u201d, it is evidently at work in her suggestion that\ntranssexuals have learned to adopt the discourse of medicalization\nwhile doing so within a subaltern transsexual culture which fails to\naccurately correspond to the official account. Certainly her suggestion\nthat transsexuals speak beyond the gender binary is anticipated in\nAnzald\u00faa's work, as is her call to mix-and-match\ngenres.\n\n\nThe differences between a vision of the self as a site for potential\ngender colonization /decolonization (as presupposed by Raymond) and a\nvision which emphasizes \u201cmestiza consciousness\u201d are\nsignificant. Mar\u00eda Lugones (1990), for example, argues that the\nformer type of vision, as articulated by philosophers such as Frye\n(1983), simply cannot succeed as a theory of resistance. The\ndifficulty, in part, is that the former seems to postulate a self\nunderlying the cultural work of oppression or at least the possibility\nof a self that has been or could be freed entirely from culture (or at\nleast gender). Yet, if such a possibility is not realistic, as it seems\nnot to be, it is hard to see how any form of resistance to oppression\ncan get a foot-hold. How can the colonized mind be open to\ntransformation and resistance given that it is already colonized? It is\nprecisely this possibility of \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d,\nargues Lugones (1990), which makes resistance possible at all.\n",
