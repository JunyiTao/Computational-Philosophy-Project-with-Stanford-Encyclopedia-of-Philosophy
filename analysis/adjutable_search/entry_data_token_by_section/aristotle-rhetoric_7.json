    "main_text": "The Nature and Purpose of Rhetoric || Is Aristotle\u2019s Conception of Rhetoric Normative?\n4.4 Is Aristotle\u2019s Conception of Rhetoric Normative?\n\nObviously, Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric is not thought to be normative\nin the moral sense that it would only provide the means for persuading\npeople of what is true, just and noble (but not of their opposites;\nsee section\n \u00a7 4.3\n above). There is however the widespread intuition that\nAristotle\u2019s rhetoric crucially differs from manuals of rhetoric\nthat recommend doing whatever it takes to win a case. This becomes\nclear already in the beginning of Rhet. I.1, where Aristotle\ncriticizes his predecessors among other things for presenting\ntechniques that are not derived from any art (techn\u00ea),\nsuch as slander and the arousal of pity and anger. He accuses them of\ndwelling on methods that instruct how to speak \u201coutside the\nsubject\u201d and to distract the attention of the hearers from the\nsubject, while good legislation, he says, requires not speaking\noutside the subject at all (indeed, \u201cspeaking outside the\nsubject\u201d was a legal term in Athenian law of Aristotle\u2019s\ntime). This immediately suggests two senses in which Aristotle\u2019s\nrhetoric is normative and does not advocate an \u2018anything\ngoes\u2019-approach to persuasion: first, the rhetorical devices are\nrequired to flow from the art or method of rhetoric and, second, they\nmust not be \u201coutside the subject\u201d. As for the first\ncriterion, Aristotle requires that art-based means of persuasion must\nbe provided by the speech alone and must rely on the systematic\nanalysis of what is persuasive in a given case (see the definition of\nrhetoric in\n \u00a7 4.1\n above). As for the second criterion, it is striking that Aristotle\nrefers to judges or jurors who just \u201csurrender to one of the\nlitigants without really judging\u201d (Rhet. I.1,\n1354b34\u20131355a1), which might be taken to mean that those people\ncast their votes in favour of the party they side with, but that their\nvotes are not based on a judgement that really considers the case at\nhand. This formulates a minimally normative criterion for what the\nrhetorical art aims at, namely the formation of a judgement in the\naudience that deserves to be called a \u2018judgement\u2019, i.e.\nthat it judges something, namely what the judges or jurors\nare asked to judge. And it seems that in rhetorical persuasion the use\nof rhetorical devices that are based on the art and are related to the\ncase at hand are more apt to bring about judgements in this genuine\nsense of the word.\n\nBy all appearances, it seems then that Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric is\nnot indifferent with regard to the persuasive means deployed. The\neffect that speakers using the Aristotelian style of rhetoric can\nbring about in the audience is thus qualified by the limited range of\ntechniques (based on the art of rhetoric) they use, which means that\nthey do not try to bring the audience over to their side at any cost,\nbut only on the basis of an argumentation that actually addresses the\npoint at issue. In this sense one might say that Aristotle\u2019s\nrhetorical method aims at something like \u2018persuasion based on\narguments\u2019, \u2018reasonable persuasion\u2019 or a\n\u2018reasoned judgment\u2019 on the audience\u2019s part.\n\nEven if this much is agreed upon, there remains a lot of room for\nscholarly disagreement on what exactly this normative approach to\nrhetoric is meant to imply. Is this normativity grounded in the\nrequirements of the art (techn\u00ea) alone, e.g. what can\nand what cannot be achieved in a methodical way, or does it hinge on\nan envisaged effect, e.g. the best possible judgement on the\nhearer\u2019s part? And which methods are approved by this normative\napproach and which definitely excluded? Does Aristotle\u2019s art of\nrhetoric require, above all, that persuasion be centred on arguments\nand proofs (that are related to the thing at issue and are, thus,\npertinent), while other art-based means of persuasion (see below\n \u00a7 5)\n are mostly thought to offer support to get one\u2019s arguments\nthrough (see e.g. Rapp 2012)? Or does the art aim at enhancing only\n\u201cwell-founded\u201d judgements or judgements that are\n\u201cformed on the basis of good grounds for conviction\u201d,\nrequiring that each particular means of persuasion provide such a good\nground for conviction (see Dow 2014 and Dow 2015)?\n",
