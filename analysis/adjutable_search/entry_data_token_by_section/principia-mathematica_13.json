It follows that the series of all ordinals\nhas an ordinal number, \\(\\Omega\\) say. But in that case the series of\nall ordinals including \\(\\Omega\\) has the ordinal number \\(\\Omega +\n1\\), which must be greater than \\(\\Omega\\), Hence \\(\\Omega\\) is not\nthe ordinal number of all ordinals. (PM Vol. I, 1925: 61 and 1910:\n63)\n\n\nIn \u2217256 we find the resolution of the Burali-Forti\ncontradiction in observing the relative types of classes of ordinals.\nOrdinal numbers, as classes of isomorphic series, will be of a higher\ntype than their members. The purported \u201cordinal number of all\nordinal numbers\u201d \\(\\Omega\\) will be restricted to a type above\nthe type of the ordinals that are its members. Just as there is no\nclass of all classes (of some type or other) there is also no ordinal\nof all ordinal numbers.\n\nTheorem \u2217256\u00b756 demonstrates that \u201cin\nhigher types there are greater ordinals than any to be found in lower\ntypes\u201d. (PM Vol.III, 75)\nZermelo\u2019s Theorem\n\n\u2217258\u00b7326\nAssuming the Axiom of Choice, every set can be\nwell-ordered.\n\n\nThis proof of Zermelo\u2019s theorem follows Zermelo\u2019s\n\u201cnew proof\u201d of Zermelo (1908). Together with\n\u2217250\u00b751 this shows that the Axiom of Choice\nis equivalent to the Well Ordering principle.\nThe Transfinite Ancestral Relation\n\nThe discussion of \u201ctransfinitely hereditary\u201d properties in\n\u2217257 constitutes the discussion of\n\u201ctransfinite induction\u201d that Russell pointed out to\nReichenbach in the discussion reported above from Russell (1959:\n86),\nFinite Ordinals\n\nIt is shown in \u2217262 that every infinite well\nordered series consists of a series (well ordered set) of\nprogressions. (\\(\\omega\\) orderings).\nThe series of Alephs\n\nA result of Hausdorff in (1906),\nthat \\(\\omega_1\\), the first\nuncountable ordinal) is not the limit of a progression of smaller\nordinals is shown to follow if one assumes the Axiom of Choice\n(\u2217265\u00b749). It is then conjectured that this\ncannot be shown without relying on the Axiom of Choice. See\nGrattan-Guinness (2000: 403) for a discussion of Hausdorff\u2019s\ninfluence on the content of PM.\n\nDorothy Wrinch, who had been a member of Russell\u2019s circle of\nunofficial students during the war, published in 1919 an article on\nDedekindian series of ordinal numbers. She describes the result as\ninvestigating \u201cnecessary and sufficient conditions that \\(P^Q\\)\nshould be Dedekindian or semi-Dedekindian when P and Q\nare well ordered series\u201d (Wrinch 1919: 219). This study follows\nup the result in \u2217124 that is described in Boolos\n(1994), as an investigation of the arithmetic of ordinals without\nassuming the Axiom of Choice. Wrinch\u2019s paper  follows not only\nthe notation of PM, but also makes use of theorems up\nto the end of section V on Series, with numbers following the dot, and\nso could easily be added as \u2217277. Russell intended\nto found a school of \u201cmathematical philosophy\u201d, and of\ncourse succeeded in attracting Ludwig Wittgenstein to the foundational\nissues in PM, but there is no other indication of logicians attempting\nto set their results in the framework of PM.\n",
