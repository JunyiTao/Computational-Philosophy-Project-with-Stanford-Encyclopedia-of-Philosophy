    "main_text": "\n\nWhen philosophers have turned their attention to the ethics of\nreproduction, they have mostly focused on abortion, and to a lesser\nextent on various assisted reproductive technologies used to create a\npregnancy. However, a number of thorny ethical issues can arise during\nthe course of a continuing pregnancy, labor, and birth, and these are\nreceiving growing attention in bioethics. This article is restricted\nto a discussion of such issues. See the entries on\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n parenthood and procreation, and\n the grounds of moral status\n for discussions of related issues such as abortion and assisted\nreproduction.\n\nPregnancy and birth can be approached from many philosophical angles.\nPregnancy raises interesting issues in philosophy of law, such as the\nappropriate legal status of the fetus and whether pregnancy ought to\nbe legally classified as a disability. Some authors have discussed\npregnancy in phenomenological terms, and others have used pregnancy\nand/or birth as a springboard for more theoretical reflections on the\nnature of selfhood, care, embodiment, and personal identity. In this\narticle, however, we will focus on pregnancy and birth insofar as they\nare treated as medical processes and situated within a\nmedical context. (The boundary around this topic is necessarily\nimperfect, since medical, legal, metaphysical, experiential, and other\ncontexts intersect. For instance, one cannot responsibly examine the\nethics of treating the fetus as a medical patient without at\nleast considering the legal ramifications of doing so.) For better or\nfor worse, in most developed countries, including the United States\nand Canada, normal pregnancy and birth are highly\n\u2018medicalized\u2019. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for women\nto experience problems during pregnancy that require medical care and\nintervention. The medical management of both \u2018normal\u2019\npregnancies and those that face complications raises a variety of\ncomplex ethical issues, and these will be our topic.\n\nWe will begin with a general discussion of pregnancy and childbirth as\nmedicalized processes. We will then move on to three categories of\nethical issues: (1) issues arising in the course of obstetrical care\nfor women who are taken to be competent and capable of autonomous\ndecision-making; (2) issues that arise when women are decisionally\nincompetent or when their right to decisional autonomy is in question;\n(3) issues concerning the management and communication of reproductive\nrisk.\n",
