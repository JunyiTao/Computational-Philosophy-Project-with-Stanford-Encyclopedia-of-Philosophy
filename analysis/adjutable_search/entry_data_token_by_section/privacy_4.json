    "main_text": "Critiques of Privacy || Posner\u2019s Economic Critique\n2.2 Posner\u2019s Economic Critique\n\nRichard Posner (1978) also presents a critical account of privacy. He\nargues that from an economic perspective, we should not assign a\nproperty right to the personal information of individuals, when doing\nso leads to economic inefficiencies. This theoretical claim is linked\nto an empirical claim that common law follows a similar economic\nlogic. Posner does not appear to deny that there is something that we\ncan call \u201cprivacy\u201d and a \u201cright to privacy\u201d.\nInstead, he argues that the notion of privacy should be attributed in\na different way, following an economic analysis of the distribution of\nproperty rights to personal information. Strictly speaking, then,\nPosner does not present a fundamental critique of privacy, but rather\nan account of privacy which is based on considerations of economic\nefficiency, and he argues that privacy is protected in ways that are\neconomically inefficient. With respect to information, in\nPosner\u2019s view privacy should only be protected when access to\npersonal information would reduce its value (for example, allowing\nstudents access to their letters of recommendation makes those letters\nless reliable and thus less valuable, and hence they should remain\nconfidential or private). Focusing on privacy as control over\ninformation about oneself, Posner argues that concealment or the\nselective disclosure of information is often used to mislead or\nmanipulate others, or for private economic gain. The protection of\nindividual privacy is therefore less defensible than others suppose,\nbecause it does not maximize wealth.\n",
