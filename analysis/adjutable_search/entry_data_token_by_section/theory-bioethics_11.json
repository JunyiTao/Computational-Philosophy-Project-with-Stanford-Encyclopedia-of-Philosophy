    "main_text": "The Move to Mid-Level Theorizing: a Principles-Centered Approach\n4. The Move to Mid-Level Theorizing: a Principles-Centered Approach\n\nThe move to what is often referred to as mid-level theorizing was\n(partly) a result of the challenges with high theory just discussed,\nand manifested most prominently by the 1979 publication of Tom\nBeauchamp and James Childress\u2019 influential Principles\nof Biomedical Ethics (PBE). The approach set out in that book,\nand its revised versions appearing in the book\u2019s subsequent\neditions, feature mid-level moral norms, which take the form of four\nmoral\n principles.[6]\n Beauchamp and Childress\u2019 four principles are:\n\nthe principle of autonomy (the value of self-direction regarding\none\u2019s life and choices),\nthe principle of beneficence (the value of enhancing the welfare\nof others),\nthe principle of nonmaleficence (the value of avoiding imposing\nharm on others), and\nthe principle of justice (the value of according each person her\ndue) (Beauchamp & Childress 2019a; Arras 2017: 5).\n\n\nComing on the heels of Joseph Fletcher and Paul Ramsey\u2019s early\nwork in what we now call bioethics\u2014both Fletcher and Ramsey were\nmoral theologians, whose work, while very different from one\nanother\u2019s, was based on Christian moral theology\u2014Beauchamp\nand Childress offered the promise of a moral framework that could\nappeal to a pluralist and secular\n society.[7]\n Beauchamp and Childress have different theoretical starting points,\nwith Beauchamp describing himself as a rule-utilitarian, and Childress\na Christian deontologist (Arras 2017: 3; Beauchamp & Childress\n1979: 40: 2019b: 9). This underlines the approach as one that refrains\nfrom promoting a single theory over all others, and as one that\nrequires no underlying theoretical or metaphysical commitments for its\nuptake.\n",
