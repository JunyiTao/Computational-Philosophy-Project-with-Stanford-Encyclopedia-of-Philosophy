Ontological Issues I: What is a Cell?\n\nNot only have the disciplines studying cells undergone historical\ntransformations, so has the understanding of what cells are. As Hesse\n(1966) argued, in many fields the objects of study are characterized\nthrough metaphors to more familiar objects. In examining the different\nmetaphors that have been invoked for cells, Reynolds argues that the\nchoice of metaphor has consequences for how cells are understood: \n\n\nMetaphorical language \u2026 has been essential not only to the\nactivity of describing cells but also to seeing and\nunderstanding them, and has played no less a fundamental role\nthan the literal and material lenses of the microscope. (2018: 4) \n\n\nReynolds distinguishes two fundamental classes of metaphors: cells\nas human artifacts and cells as organisms. Each has\ntaken on a variety of more specific forms. Among artifacts, cells have\nbeen characterized as spaces enclosed by solid walls, building blocks,\nfactories, various types of machines, and electronic computers. The\norganismal metaphors have suggested a conceptualization of cells as\nelementary organisms (like unicellular amoebae) or citizens in a state\nor society in which there is a division of labor and in which cells\nmake decisions that determine their own developmental\n\u2018fates\u2019, including the ultimate decision to initiate\nprogrammed cell death (Reynolds\n 2014).[1]\n These metaphors have given rise to distinctive research agendas that\nfocus on specific aspects of cells and their relationship to other\ncells and their environment.\n\nWhen Hooke introduced the term cell in Micrographia\nin 1665 to describe the microscopic structure of cork that he observed\nusing a compound microscope\n (Figure 2A),\n he was comparing cells to the polygonal cells of beeswax and the\nsmall rooms occupied by monks in a monastery. (Hooke 1665: 116, also\ncommented on the fluid content of cells, labeling them\n\u201csuccus nutritus, or appropriate juices of\nvegetables\u201d. As discussed below, the fluid content of cells took\non new importance with the advent of the protoplasm theories in the\nmid-nineteenth century.) Although researchers who focused on plants\ntended to find Hooke\u2019s metaphor appropriate, since plant cells\nhave clearly observable walls, others, beginning with van Leeuwenhoek,\nwho examined spermatozoa\n (Figure 2B),\n animal tissues, and bacteria, tended to adopt other terms such as\ncorpuscle or globule. \n\n\n\n\nA. Hooke\u2019s (1665: Schem: XI, fig.\n1 facing page 115) drawing of his observations of cells in cork.\n\n\n\n\nB.Van Leeuwenhoek\u2019s drawing of\nspermatozoa from his Letter to Nehemiah Grew, 18 March 1678.  \n\n\nFigure 2: Hooke\u2019s drawing clearly\nshows cells as areas enclosed by walls whereas van Leeuwenhoek\u2019s\npresents what we call cells as simple organisms.\n\n\nMost of these early investigators focused on describing what they saw\nin the microscope. But some, such as Buffon (1749), began to view\ncells as basic living units. Nicholson characterizes this as the\nbeginning of an atomist tradition in biology that identified \n\n\na basic indivisible unit of life and [sought] to explain the\nmorphological constitution and physiological operation of all living\nbeings in terms of these fundamental units. (2010: 203) \n\n\nThis more theoretically committed conception of cells is exemplified\nin the publications of Schleiden (1838) and Schwann (1839), who are\ngenerally credited with establishing the cell theory, the fundamental\ntenet of which is that cells are the basic units of living things.\n\nFocusing exclusively on plants, Schleiden asserted that\n\u201c\u2026 every plant \u2026 is an aggregate of fully\nindividualized, independent, separate beings, the cells\nthemselves\u201d (1838 [1847: 231\u20132]). In addition to their\nwalls, Schleiden appealed to the nucleus, which had been identified\nwith improved microscopes by Brown (1833), to identify plant\ncells. The nucleus figured centrally in Schleiden\u2019s account of\ncell formation according to which a new cell formed through a process\nlike crystal formation\u2014one type of material is deposited around\nthe nucleolus to form the nucleus and then other material was\ndeposited to form the cell body. The metaphor comparing cell formation\nto crystal formation played a yet larger role when Schwann confronted\nthe challenge that animal cells differ vastly in their\nappearance. Schwann argued that they were nonetheless all cells since\nthey all formed through a process analogous to crystal formation: \n\n\nThe elementary parts of all tissues are formed of cells in an\nanalogous, though very diversified manner, so that it may be asserted\nthat there is one universal principle of development for the\nelementary parts of organisms, however different, and that this\nprinciple is the formation of cells. (Schwann 1839 [1847: 165])\n\n\n\n(For discussion of this and other uses of the crystal metaphor in\nbiology, see Haraway 1976.)\n\nGiven that Schwann and Schleiden were masters of microscopy (as\nwitnessed by their drawings based on their microscopic observations),\nand that other equally competent microscopists reported cells\ndividing, their claim that cells form like crystals seems anomalous.\nBechtel (1984) argues that Schwann\u2019s strong commitment to\ndeveloping mechanistic accounts of vital processes may have played a\nmajor role in how he interpreted what he saw\u2014the crystal\nformation metaphor provided a mechanistic model whereas at the time\nthere were no mechanical models for cell division. In any case,\nSchleiden\u2019s and Schwann\u2019s accounts of cell formation were\nsoon set aside as more researchers reported on cell division and\nSchwann\u2019s concerns with mechanism were supplanted by other\nconcerns. Virchow (1855), a pathologist, offered a theoretic argument\nthat only a process like cell division could explain the transmission\nof disease and coined the oft-cited dictum \u201comnis cellula e\ncellula\u201d (all cells come from cells). \n\nSchwann\u2019s \u201ctheory of the cell\u201d, however, was much\nricher than his soon rejected view of cell formation. He argued that\ncells were the basic units in which the processes of life (he coined\nthe term metabolism) occurred. He viewed metabolic processes\nas catalyzed by the specific materials that were deposited in cells as\nthey formed. Schwann (1836) had himself recently discovered pepsin, a\ncatalyst that breaks down egg albumin. (Pepsin operates, however, not\nwithin cells but after being secreted into digestive fluid.) When a\nyear later he argued that fermentation could not occur without the\ninvolvement of a whole living yeast cell (Schwann 1837), some critics\ntook Schwann to be claiming that living systems exhibited mysterious\nvital properties. But for Schwann this was consistent with his\nmechanist approach\u2014the metabolic processes only occurred when\nthe responsible catalysts were brought together in cells.\n\nIn the mid- to late-nineteenth century theorizing about cells went in\na number of directions. One direction focused even more than Schwann\non the material stuff constituting the cell. In the same period as\nSchwann was advancing his theory of the cell, von Mohl (1835), a plant\nresearcher, introduced the name protoplasm for the fluid\nmaterial in cells. Animal researchers such as Dujardin (1835) called\nthe fluid seen in animal cells sarcode. Remak (1852) proposed\nthe protoplasm theory according to which the basic material of plants\nand animal was identical and T. H. Huxley (1869) took this a step\nfurther, arguing that protoplasm was the \u201cphysical basis of\nlife\u201d. As discussed by Reynolds, protoplasm theory offered a\ndifferent fundamental biological theory\u2014whereas Schleiden and\nSchwann \n\n\nsought to unify all the various forms of life through a common\nmorphological type and developmental principle, the protoplasm theory\nattempted to achieve this through the identification of a common\nsubstance or material. (2018: 32) \n\n\nAccordingly, some supporters of protoplasm sought to dislodge the cell\nas a basic living unit. The botanist Julius Sachs (1892), for example,\nasserted \u201cto call the protoplasm unit a cell was about as\nappropriate as calling a live bee in a honeycomb a cell\u201d (as\ntranslated by Welch & Clegg 2010: C1281). Since protoplasm appears\nas a viscous substance that is only artificially constrained by cell\nboundaries, some protoplasm theorists viewed it as supplanting the\ncell as an organizing unit. Where Schwann understood the cell to be\nthe fundamental unit of biological development, protoplasm theorists\nunderstood protoplasm to drive ontogeny and cells to be merely\nsecondary structures deposited in the course of this primary\nsubstance\u2019s development. Recently a few biologists (Welch &\nClegg 2010, 2012) and philosophers (Nicholson, 2010) have argued for\nreviving protoplasm theory. Their argument is that protoplasm theory\npresents a more holistic systems or organismal perspective. (We\ndiscuss holism and organicism in\n Section 3.)\n\nThe characterization of protoplasm as just a viscous substance\nexisting on its own was complicated by the identification of the cell\nmembrane as a structure distinct from the cell wall and, as discussed\nbelow, of membrane-bound organelles. In the end, most biologists\nacquiesced in some version of Schultze\u2019s (1861: 11; as\ntranslated by Hall, 1951: 451) compromise position that raised\nprotoplasm to be one defining feature of cells when he defined a cell\nas \u201ca lump of protoplasm inside of which lies a\nnucleus\u201d. Those who adopted such a compromise position often\ninvoked a metaphor, originating with Raspail, according to which the\ncell is \u201ca kind of laboratory within which all tissues organize\nand grow\u201d (1843: 28; as translated by Harris, 1999: 32). The\nlaboratory metaphor encouraged attempts to develop chemical\nexplanations for all the reactions occurring in cells. There were a\nnumber of variants on this theme. Unger analogized the plant cell with\na \u201cm\u00e4chtige chemische Werkst\u00e4tte\u201d (powerful\nchemical workshop) (1851: 23) and Virchow stated that \u201cstarch is\ntransformed into sugar in the plant and animal just as it is in a\nfactory\u201d (1858: 107). \n\nEmbracing this chemical perspective, several chemists sought to\nidentify the chemical catalysts needed for the reactions to occur.\nFermentation was a common focus and K\u00fchne (1877) coined the term\nenzyme (Greek for \u201cin yeast\u201d) for the putative\ncatalyst operative in yeast. Enthusiasm for this effort was\ntemporarily dampened by Pasteur (1860). A noted chemist, he\nnonetheless maintained that fermentation could only be carried out in\nwhole living cells. This reflects a conception of the cell as an\nexplanatorily irreducible unit of life\u2014a conception associated\nwith vitalism (discussed in more detail below). Enthusiasm for the\nfactory conception, though, was rekindled by Buchner (1897). Guided by\nPasteur\u2019s contention that fermentation could not occur in the\nabsence of cells, he added sugar to an extract he prepared by\ndestroying all whole cells, thinking it would serve as a preservative.\nWhen he observed the emission of bubbles, indicating fermentation in\nthe absence of living cells, he changed course and galvanized the\npursuit of chemical investigations of metabolism that resulted in the\nestablishment of modern biochemistry in the first decades of the\ntwentieth century (Kohler 1971; Cornish-Bowden 1997). One of its early\nsuccesses was the characterization in the 1930s of a pathway of enzyme\ncatalyzed reactions responsible for fermentation (Bechtel 1986).\n\nAt first the factory metaphor simply identified the cell as the place\nin which chemical reactions occur, but over time researchers began to\nfocus on the different machines within the factory. The focus on\nseparate machines in the factory was promoted in the late nineteenth\nand early twentieth century when, using improved microscopes and\napplying stains to enhance contrast, investigators began to identify\nstructures within cells and theorize about their functional\nsignificance. Researchers were particularly successful in\ncharacterizing the nuclear events in cell division and fertilization.\nFlemming (1879, 1882) described in detail how the threads that he\ncalled chromatin (due to their absorption of dye), later\nnamed chromosomes, divided longitudinally, with the two\nhalves moving apart so that one of each would end up in each daughter\ncell\n (Figure 3).\n Soon after researchers such as Weismann and Correns pointed to links\nbetween chromosome transmission and heredity, but it was Boveri (1902)\nand Sutton (1903) who provided the compelling evidence that\nMendel\u2019s factors (what would soon be called genes) are\nin or on chromosomes. Darden and Maull (1977) analyze the linking of\ngenes to chromosomes as a major example of what they termed\ninterfield theories, theories that do not try to reduce one\naccount to another but integrate the findings of different fields in a\ntheory that bridges them.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Flemming\u2019s (1882)\ndrawings of the stages of mitosis that highlights the formation of\nspindles and their role in segregating chromosomes. Images 1\u20133 \nare from Tafel IIIa; 4\u20137 from Tafel IIIb. (Figure from\n wiki commons.)\n\n\nLate in the nineteenth century cytologists also succeeded in\nidentifying membrane-enclosed structures in the cytoplasm that came to\nbe known as organelles. Altmann (1890), using new stains he\ndeveloped, observed filaments within cells that he took to be\nelementary organisms (a view he explicitly set in opposition to the\nprotoplasm theory). Although many researchers challenged\nAltmann\u2019s observations, Benda (1899) confirmed the existence of\nfilaments using a different stain and gave them the name\nmitochondria (Greek for \u201cthread\u201d and\n\u201cgranule\u201d). Because of their reactivity with oxidative\nstains, Michaelis (1899) proposed that they figured in oxidative\nreactions in cells. Yet other researchers identified other organelles\nsuch as the Golgi apparatus (Golgi 1898) and ergastoplasm (Garnier\n1897), which was ultimately identified as the endoplasmic\nreticulum.\n\nIn the early decades in the twentieth century biochemists and\ncytologists developed their own research techniques and pursued their\ninvestigations independently of the other. Most biochemists implicitly\nembraced the assumption that the cell was a bag of chemicals that\ncould be studied in the extracts remaining after cell structure was\ndestroyed whereas those pursuing cytological inquiries tended to\nembrace the factory metaphor in which organelles were distinct\nmachines. As witnessed by Cowdry\u2019s (1924) General\nCytology and Bourne\u2019s (1942) Cytology and Cell\nPhysiology, there were researchers who desired to build bridges\nbetween biochemistry and cytology. There were some techniques, albeit\nlimited, for determining the chemical composition of organelles\n(essentially, those of cytochemistry and histochemistry, which relied\non determining to which chemicals various stains bound). The nearly\nsimultaneous introduction of cell fractionation and electron\nmicroscopy in the late 1940s provided the needed research techniques\nand, as noted in\n Section 1,\n helped establish modern cell biology (Bechtel 2006; Matlin 2018). In\naddition to the linkage of microsomes to the endoplasmic reticulum,\ndescribed above, researchers linked oxidative metabolism to the inner\nmembrane of the mitochondrion. New structures were also discovered and\nconnected to functions, such as the lysosome which was linked to the\nbreakdown and recycling of disrupted cell components (de Duve\n1958).\n\nThe process of advancing new conceptions of cells continues. We note\njust one example here. The pioneers of cell biology in the 1940s and\n1950s embraced the machines in a factory metaphor, treating cell\norganelles as compartments in which different chemical reactions were\ncatalyzed by the enzymes housed there. Once formed, the compartments,\non this view, did not change\u2014the crucial activities occurred\nwithin them. Over time, however, some researchers within cell biology\nbegan to identify cell structures that executed mechanical movements,\nas anticipated by Flemming\u2019s (1882) characterization of the cell\nspindle as pulling chromosomes apart in mitosis. Of particular\nimportance was research on the cytoskeleton (consisting of actin\nfibres and microtubules). The term cytoskeleton was invoked\nin the 1930s and 1940s to denote a rigid structure, and indeed it does\nhelp give cells their shape. But it was soon found to be the locus of\nmovement. H. E. Huxley (1969) advanced an account of muscle\ncontraction as resulting from myosin molecules forming bridges that\npull on actin filaments. Both actin filaments and microtubules were\nfound to continually extend themselves at one end by incorporating new\nproteins while removing them from the other, a process characterized\nas treadmilling (Cleveland 1982). Video observations of\norganelles moving along microtubules (R. Allen et al. 1982) led to the\ndiscovery of kinesins (Vale, Reese, & Sheetz 1985), molecular\nmotors that walk along microtubules carrying cargo. It also\nfocused new attention on dyneins (Paschal & Vallee 1987),\npreviously only known for their roles in cilia and flagella, as\ncarrying cargo in the opposite direction. Recognition of this\ncontinual movement of material within cells gave rise to a new\nmetaphor of the cell as a city with bustling traffic (Vale &\nMilligan 2000).\n",
