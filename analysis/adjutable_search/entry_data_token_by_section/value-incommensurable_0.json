    "main_text": "Value Incommensurability\n1. Value Incommensurability \n\nIncommensurability between values must be distinguished from the kind\nof incommensurability associated with Paul Feyerabend (1978, 1981,\n1993) and Thomas Kuhn (1977, 1983, 1996) in epistemology and the\nphilosophy of science. Feyerabend and Kuhn were concerned with\nincommensurability between rival theories or paradigms \u2014 that\nis, the inability to express or comprehend one conceptual scheme, such\nas Aristotelian physics, in terms of another, such as Newtonian\nphysics.\n\nIn contrast, contemporary inquiry into value incommensurability\nconcerns comparisons among abstract values (such as liberty or\nequality) or particular bearers of value (such as a certain\ninstitution or its effects on liberty or equality). The term\n\u201cbearer of value\u201d is to be understood broadly. Bearers of\nvalue can be objects of potential choice (such as a career) or states\nof affairs that cannot be chosen (such as a beautiful sunset). Such\nbearers of value are valuable in virtue of the abstract value or\nvalues they instantiate or display (so, for example, an institution\nmight be valuable in virtue of the liberty or equality that it\nengenders or embodies).\n",
