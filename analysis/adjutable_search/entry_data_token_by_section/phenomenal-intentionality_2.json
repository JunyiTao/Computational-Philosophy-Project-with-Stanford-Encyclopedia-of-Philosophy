    "main_text": "The phenomenal intentionality theory || Weak, Moderate, and Strong PIT\n2.2 Weak, Moderate, and Strong PIT\nThe following three theses about the relationship between phenomenal\nintentional states and intentional states are ways of precisifying the idea that phenomenal intentionality plays an important role in the mind:\n\n\nStrong\u00a0PIT:\nAll intentional states are phenomenal intentional\nstates.\n\nModerate\u00a0PIT:\nAll intentional states either are phenomenal intentional states\nor are at least partly grounded in phenomenal intentional\nstates.\n\nWeak\u00a0PIT:\nSome intentional states are phenomenal intentional\nstates.\n\n\nThe \u201call\u201d in the above theses should be\nunderstood as quantifying over all actual intentional states, not all\nmetaphysically possible intentional states. In the same way that some\nphysicalist theories of intentionality allow that there are merely\npossible forms of intentionality that are independent of physical\nproperties, PIT can allow that there are non-actual intentional states\nthat have nothing to do with phenomenal consciousness. Of course, more\nspecific versions of PIT might make stronger claims. \nOf the three views mentioned above, Strong PIT asserts the strongest\npossible relationship between phenomenal intentionality and\nintentionality: it claims that phenomenal intentionality is the only\nkind of intentionality there is. Relatively few hold this view, but\nversions of it have been defended by Pitt (2004), Farkas (2008a), and\nMendelovici (2010, 2018). The difficulty with this view, as we will see\nbelow, is that it is not clear that there are enough phenomenal states\nor phenomenal states of the right kind to constitute all intentional\nstates. For example, it is not easy to see how standing beliefs like\nyour belief that grass is green could be constituted by phenomenal\nstates.\nModerate PIT is significantly weaker than Strong PIT. It is compatible with the\nexistence of non-phenomenal intentional states but claims that any\nsuch non-phenomenal intentional states are at least partly grounded in\nphenomenal intentional states. \n\nThere are different ways of explicating the intuitive notion of\ngrounding used in the definition of Moderate PIT. For our purposes\nhere, we can say that A grounds B when B obtains\nin virtue of A. This gloss is itself in need of further\nanalysis, but for now it is enough to know that grounding is an\nasymmetric relation of metaphysical determination (see Trogdon 2013\nfor an introduction to grounding). An example of grounding that is\nsimilar to the grounding relation posited by some proponents of\nModerate PIT is the (alleged) grounding of linguistic meaning in\nspeaker intentions: on many views of language, words have their\nmeanings in virtue of speakers\u2019 intentions toward them. To say\nthat A is partly grounded in B is to that say\nthat A is grounded in the combination of B and other\nfactors.\n\nThere are different views of how phenomenal intentionality might\npartly ground non-phenomenal intentionality:\n\nOne view is that non-phenomenal intentional states are simply\ndispositions to have phenomenal intentional states and that these\ndispositions get their contents from the phenomenal intentional states\nthat they are dispositions to bring about (Searle 1983, 1990, 1991,\n1992). On this view, standing beliefs about grass that are not\nphenomenal intentional states are dispositions to have phenomenal intentional states with the same or related contents.\n\nAnother view is that non-phenomenal intentional states get their\nintentionality from functional relations they bear to phenomenal\nintentional states (Loar 2003a, Horgan & Tienson 2002, Graham,\nHorgan, & Tienson 2007). On this view, a standing belief that\ngrass is green might have its content in virtue of being suitably\nconnected to a host of phenomenal intentional states.\n\nA third view is that non-phenomenal intentionality is a matter of\nideal rational interpretation (Kriegel 2011a,b, Pautz 2013). On Kriegel\u2019s view, for example, the relevant phenomenal intentional states are in the mind of a possible ideal\nrational interpreter.\n\nMore versions of Moderate PIT will be discussed below. Proponents of\nModerate PIT (or something close to it) include Loar (1987, 1988,\n1995, 2003a, 2003b), Searle (1983, 1990, 1991, 1992), Goldman\n(1993a,b), Siewert (1998), McGinn (1988), Kriegel (2003, 2011a,b),\nHorgan, Tienson & Graham (2003, 2004, 2006, 2007), Georgalis\n(2006), Pitt (2004, 2009, 2011), Farkas (2008a,b, 2013), Mendola\n(2008), Chalmers (2010: xxiv), Bourget (2010), Pautz (2010, 2013),\nSmithies (2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2014), and Montague (2016).\n\nWeak PIT merely claims that there is phenomenal intentionality. It\nallows that there are non-phenomenal intentional states that have\nnothing to do with phenomenal consciousness. The proponents of Weak\nPIT are too many to list. As we will see below, Weak PIT is entailed\nby some widely accepted views in philosophy of mind, including many\nforms of representationalism about phenomenal consciousness, the view\nthat phenomenal states are identical to intentional states (perhaps that meet certain further conditions).\n\nSince Moderate PIT is the strongest view that is endorsed by most\nproponents of the general approach, it is the view that\nhas the best claim to being the phenomenal intentionality\ntheory. For this reason, this article will focus mainly on Moderate\nPIT. Unless otherwise indicated, we will use \u201cPIT\u201d to\nrefer to Moderate PIT. (Note that Strong PIT is a version of Moderate PIT, while Weak PIT is not a version of PIT at all, but rather a weakening of the view.)\n",
