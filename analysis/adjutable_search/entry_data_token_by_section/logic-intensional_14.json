    "main_text": "Sense as Algorithm\n4. Sense as Algorithm\nFollowing Frege, the mathematical expressions \u201c\\(1+4\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(2+3\\)\u201d have the same denotation but different\nsenses. Frege did not actually say what a sense was, though it was\nclear that, somehow, sense determined denotation. Earlier we talked of\ncomputations associated with \u201c\\(1+4\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(2+3\\)\u201d, but what we presented was quite\nsimple-minded. Tich\u00fd introduced the idea of\na construction with these two expressions prescribing\ndifferent constructions. A much more formal version of this appears in\na series of papers, (Moschovakis 1994; Moschovakis 2006; Kalyvianaki\nand Moschovakis 2008), all of which trace back to (Moschovakis\n1989). In these is a very sophisticated formalism in which the sense\nor intension of an expression is an algorithm, and algorithm execution\ndetermines denotation. In what follows we sketch the ideas, skimping\non most technical details.\nTo keep things relatively simple we confine our discussion to\nsentences of a formal language for which, again following Frege,\ndenotation is simply a truth value. Both \u201cthere are infinitely\nmany primes\u201d and \u201cthere are infinitely many even\nnumbers\u201d agree on denotation\u2014both are true\u2014but\nclearly have different senses. All the basic ideas of Moschovakis are\nalready present at the sentence level, though the ideas extend\nbroadly. We quote from (Moschovakis 1994), on which our presentation\nis based.\n\nThe mathematical results of the paper are about formal languages,\nbut they are meant to apply also to those fragments of natural\nlanguage which can be formalized, much as the results of denotational\nsemantics for formal languages are often applied to fragments of\nnatural language. In addition to the language of predicate logic whose\nsense semantics are fairly simple, the theory also covers languages\nwith description operators, arbitrary connectives and modal operators,\ngeneralized quantifiers, indirect reference and the ability to define\ntheir own truth predicate.\n\nIf sense is to be identified with algorithm, perhaps the most basic\nquestion is: what is an algorithm. For Moschovakis, as for many\nworking mathematicians, an algorithm is an abstract mathematical\nobject, in the same way that a number is. Of course one uses special\nnotation to work with a number or an algorithm, but notation is\nsyntactic while mathematical objects are semantic (even\nideal). Algorithmic subject matter may vary: an algorithm for baking a\ncake does not operate in the same space as an algorithm for solving\nquadratic equations. Some formalism is needed so that algorithms can\nbe specified, and this machinery should be suitable for all subjects,\nyet as simple as possible. There are several general, but equivalent,\napproaches to algorithmic specification across a range of subject\nmatters. Moschovakis (1994) introduces a very simple, direct mechanism\nwhich he calls the Lower Predicate Calculus with Reflection,\nwhere reflection essentially\nmeans self-reference. Of course not all algorithms terminate,\nand consequently the underlying truth value space needs some\nconsideration, but a solution along Kripke\u2019s lines in his Theory\nof Truth works well. We lead up to a general definition via some (for\nthe time being) informal examples.\n",
