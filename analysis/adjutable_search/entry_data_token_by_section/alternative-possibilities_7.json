    "main_text": "Arguments for PAP || Ordinary Judgments about Responsibility\n2.2 Ordinary Judgments about Responsibility\n\nPAP is supported by a wide range of cases in which we judge that\nwithout alternatives, we are not responsible for acting\u2014not\nresponsible, it seems, because we lack alternatives.\n\nConsider persons with mental disorders such as kleptomania or\nagoraphobia. When these disorders are considered severe enough to\ncompel behavior, blame and resentment no longer seem warranted. (It is\nthe reasoning employed in ordinary judgment that\u2019s relevant\nhere, but for scientific evidence against the compulsion of some\nmental disorders, see Schroeder 2005; Vranas 2007; Pickard 2015.)\nSimilarly, we may be less inclined to condemn a criminal when we\ndiscover that his illegal acts were the result of a brain tumor\n(Sinnott-Armstrong 2012), or to praise the generosity of person who is\ncompelled to give things away (Bennett 2008). Those who, whether\npathologically or not, act from overwhelming stress, fear, or guilt\nare not praised or blamed for what they do. And while young children\nmay have a limited capacity for self-control (Duckworth, Gendler,\n& Gross 2014), among the many reasons we don\u2019t hold them\nmorally responsible is that we think they are often powerless to\nresist their impulses.\n\nSimilar lessons can be drawn from cases of manipulation, in which\nagents are influenced through physical or psychological means.\nExamples of the latter include brainwashing, hypnosis, and duress. One\nmight also include more high-tech examples in which the manipulation\noccurs via direct control of the victim\u2019s brain. (Such examples\nare usually science-fiction, but see Krug, Salzman, & Waddell\n2015.) The extent to which manipulation involves removing, rather than\nmerely reducing, alternatives depends on the mechanism at work. But\ninsofar as we take such examples to involve the blocking of\nalternatives, we take them to rule out responsibility as well.\n\nIn reply, an opponent of PAP may concede that in all such cases, both\nresponsibility and alternatives are diminished or absent, yet still\ndeny that we can generalize from these to PAP, for in addition to\nlacking alternatives, these agents are missing other important moral\nor psychological capacities. It could be the absence of these, not the\nlack of alternatives, that explains why these agents aren\u2019t\nresponsible (cp. Wallace 1994: ch. 5). Put another way: perhaps having\nalternatives is merely correlated in ordinary circumstances with the\ntrue requirements for responsibility, whatever those might be. A more\nrefined test of PAP needs to look at more exotic scenarios in which\nthese other conditions are present while alternatives are not\n (\u00a73.4;\n see\n \u00a74.1\n for more on \u201cordinary circumstances\u201d).\n",
