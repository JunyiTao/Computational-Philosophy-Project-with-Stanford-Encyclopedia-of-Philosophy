    "main_text": "The Semantics of Second Intentions\n7. The Semantics of Second Intentions\n\nNot until the end of the fourteenth century did anyone claim\nextramental reality for second intentions, not even Walter Burley.\nAccording to him, second intentions are concepts that have a\nfoundation in the extramental world, but are not \u201cthings\u201d\nin the proper sense of the term. This account implied that the\nkeystone of medieval realism, the principle of one-to-one\ncorrespondence between language and the world, has to suffer an\nexception, since no common nature matches second intention terms. It\nwas just in order to do away with this exception that Alyngton (then\nfollowed by William Penbygull, Roger Whelpdale, and John Tarteys)\nhypostatized second intentions, heavily modifying the standard theory\nof the status of second intentions. In fact, Alyngton not only\nconsiders second intentions as objective, but clearly hypostatizes\nthem, speaking of them in terms of real determinations joined to the\nmodes of being of extramental things and directly inhering in them\n(In Cat., cap. de substantia, pp. 268\u201369). As\na consequence, he conceives of logic as an analysis of the general\nframework of reality, since according to him logic turns on structural\nforms (aimed at building up semantic contents), which are, as forms,\nindependent of both such contents and of the mental acts by which they\nare learned. It is through these forms that the network connecting the\nbasic constituents of the world (individuals and universals,\nsubstances and accidents) is disclosed to us (In Cat., cap.\nde substantia, pp. 278\u201379). The strategy that supports\nthis choice is evident: as in the case of relations of reason,\nAlyngton is trying to substitute references to external reality for\nreferences to mental activity. In other words, he seeks to reduce\nepistemology to ontology. From a logical point of view, this means\nthat the same interpretative pattern is employed in order to account\nfor both the semantic power of proper names and common terms (that is,\nthose expressions that refer to a class of individuals), and first and\nsecond intentions. Like proper names, common terms also primarily\nsignify and label a unique object\u2014that is, a common nature. But\nunlike the object signified by a proper name, the reality of the\ncommon nature is distributed among many individuals as their main\nmetaphysical constituent, since it determines the typical features of\nthe individuals themselves. By associating common terms with such\nobjects as their main referent, Alyngton thinks he can explain the\nfact that a common term can stand for and label many individuals at\nonce. Only in this way does he believe we can grant the value of our\nknowledge, which otherwise lacks an adequate foundation (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, fols. 101v\u2013102v).\n\nStill, this procedure, so strong and powerful, leads to a paradox when\napplied to terms of second intention by which we speak of singular\nobjects considered as such\u2014that is, terms (or expressions) like\n\u2018first substance\u2019 (substantia prima),\n\u2018individual\u2019 (individuum), and so on. In fact,\naccording to Alyngton (and many other Realists of that period), a\ncommon term is always matched by a common nature really existing in\nthe world. Therefore, as the term \u2018individual\u2019 appears to\nbe common, since it can stand for a multiplicity of things, it should\nsignify an extramental common nature shared by them. As a consequence,\nwe would have to admit the existence of an individual common\nnature, that is a (self-contradictory) entity present in all the\nindividuals as the cause of their being individuals. Alyngton, who\nwould not give up the principle of the one-to-one relation between\nphilosophical language and the world, could remove this paradox only\nby classifying this kind of term among atomic (discreti)\nterms\u2014that is, terms or nominal syntagms, like\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 or \u2018this man\u2019 (hic homo),\nthat refer to individuals and not to sets of individuals. According to\nAlyngton, there are three main kinds of atomic terms:\n\npersonal pronouns, which identify a singular definite referent by\nmeans of an ostensive definition (a demonstratione);\nproper names; and\nrange-narrowed expressions (a limitatione\nintellectus)\u2014that is, expressions, like \u2018this\nman\u2019, that identify a singular referent as a member of a given\n(manifested) set of individuals. Also expressions like \u2018first\nsubstance\u2019 and \u2018individual\u2019 belong to this third\ntype, since they presuppose a general concept (substance and being, in\nthe example), the range of which is narrowed to a unique object among\nsubstances and beings by an act of our intellect\u2014to one object\nthat is not common (In Cat., cap. de substantia, pp.\n270\u201371).\n\n\nThe rule that terms can be listed as common ones if and only if they\nsignify a common nature is safe, but at the cost of a counterintuitive\ncategorization of their semantic power. In fact, according to\nAlyngton\u2019s account, saying that Socrates and Plato are first\nsubstances simply means that (i) each one is what he is, and that (ii)\nwhat each one is is a non-universal substance. This is a solution that\nentails that to be an individual is not a positive state of affairs,\nbut a negative one, and therefore connects Alyngton\u2019s ontology\nwith Henry of Ghent\u2019s theory of individuation.\n",
