    "main_text": "Faith and reason: the epistemology of faith\n4. Faith and reason: the epistemology of faith\n\nModels of faith as knowledge may be thought lacking because they admit\nno actional component in faith itself. Faith seems essentially to\ninvolve some kind of active venture in commitment and trust,\neven if talk of a \u2018leap of faith\u2019 may not be wholly apt.\nMany have held that faith ventures beyond what is ordinarily\nknown or justifiably held true, in the sense that faith involves\naccepting what cannot be established as true through the proper\nexercise of our naturally endowed human cognitive faculties. As Kant\nfamously reports, in the Preface to the Second Edition of his\nCritique of Pure Reason: \u2018I have \u2026 found it\nnecessary to deny knowledge, in order to make room for\nfaith\u2019 (Kant 1787 [1933, 29]). Theist philosophers do,\nhowever, typically defend the claim that faith is not \u2018contrary\nto reason\u2019. On models of faith that take a cognitive component\nas central, and construe faith\u2019s object as propositional,\nreasonable faith therefore seems subject to a general\nevidentialist principle\u2014\u2018a wise man ...\nproportions his belief to the evidence\u2019, as Hume puts it (Hume\n1748 [2007], \u201cOf Miracles\u201d, 80). And W. K. Clifford\nelevates evidentialism to the status of an absolute moral requirement,\naffirming that \u2018it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone\nto believe anything upon insufficient evidence\u2019 (Clifford 1877\n[1999, 77]. Faith\u2019s venturesomeness may thus seem in tension\nwith its reasonableness, and models of faith differ in the way they\nnegotiate this tension in response to evidentialist challenges.\nAnother way to classify models of faith, then, is in terms of their\nassociated epistemology\u2014and, in particular, whether and\naccording to what norms of \u2018evidential support\u2019, they\naccept that faith\u2019s cognitive component needs to meet a\nrequirement to be grounded on available evidence.\n\nThe Reformed epistemologist model of faith as \u2018basic\u2019\nknowledge (outlined in Section 3) generates an epistemology under\nwhich, although ordinary cognitive faculties and sources of evidence\ndo not yield firm and certain inferred knowledge of theistic truths,\nthere is (if Christian theism is true) a \u2018higher\u2019\ncognitive faculty that neatly makes up the deficit. This model seems\nthus to secure the rationality of faith: if faith consists in beliefs\nthat have the status of knowledge, faith can hardly fail to be\nrational. And, once the deliverances of the special cognitive faculty\nare included amongst the believer\u2019s basic experiential evidence,\nan evidential requirement on reasonable belief seems to be met. (Note\nthat Plantinga originally expressed his defence of \u2018properly\nbasic\u2019 theistic belief in terms of the rationality of believing\nin God \u2018without any evidence or argument at all\u2019\n(Plantinga 1983, 17). He does respect an evidential requirement,\nhowever, holding that it may be fully met through what is basically,\nnon-inferentially, evident in the believer\u2019s experience. Hence\nPlantinga\u2019s insistence that his Reformed epistemology is not\nfideistic (Plantinga 2000, 263).)\n\nReflective faith and the question of entitlement\n\nIt is not clear, however, whether Reformed epistemology\u2019s model\nof faith can achieve all that is needed to show that theist faith is\nreasonable. From the perspective of reflective persons of faith (or\nwould-be faith), the question of entitlement arises: are they\nrationally, epistemically\u2014even, morally\u2014entitled to adopt\nor continue in their faith? This question will be existentially\nimportant, since faith will not be of the kind exemplified by\nreligious faith unless its commitments make a significant difference\nto how one lives one\u2019s life. Reflective believers, who are aware\nof the many options for faith and the possibility of misguided and\neven harmful faith-commitments, will wish to be satisfied that they\nare justified in their faith. The theist traditions hold a\ndeep fear of idolatry\u2014of giving one\u2019s \u2018ultimate\nconcern\u2019 (Tillich 1957 [2001]) to an object unworthy of it. The\ndesire to be assured of entitlement to faith is thus not merely\nexternally imposed by commitment to philosophical critical values: it\nis a demand internal to the integrity of theistic faith itself.\nArguably, believers must even take seriously the possibility that the\nGod they have been worshipping is not, after all, the true God\n(Johnston 2009). But, for this concern to be met, there will need to\nbe conditions sufficient for justified faith that are\n\u2018internalist\u2019\u2014that is, conditions whose obtaining\nis, at least indirectly if not directly, accessible to believers\nthemselves. And, as already noted, those conditions are widely assumed\nto include an evidentialist requirement that faith is justified only\nif the truth of its cognitive content is adequately supported by the\navailable evidence.\n\nThe Reformed epistemologist model as leaving the question of\nentitlement unanswered\n\nIt may be argued, however, that, if the Reformed\nepistemologist\u2019s model is correct, those who seek to meet an\nevidentialist requirement will be unable to satisfy themselves of\ntheir entitlement to their faith. Theistic truths may be directly\nrevealed, and experienced as immediately evident, yet, on reflection,\none may doubt whether such experiences are genuinely revelatory since\ncompeting \u2018naturalist\u2019 interpretations of those\nexperiences seem available. Furthermore, there are rival sources\nyielding contrary claims that equally claim to be authentically\nrevelatory. It may be true, as Plantinga\u2019s Reformed epistemology\nmaintains, that if God exists then certain basic theist\nbeliefs meet externalist criteria for knowledge, even though the truth\nof the propositions concerned remains open to reflective\n\u2018internalist\u2019 doubt. On an externalist account, that is,\none might lack independent evidence sufficient to confirm that one has\nknowledge that God exists while in fact possessing that very\nknowledge. One may thus refute an objector who claims that\nwithout adequate evidence one cannot possess knowledge. But this\nconsideration is still insufficient to secure entitlement to theistic\nfaith\u2014if, as may be argued, that entitlement requires that\none has evidence adequate to justify commitment to the truth\nthat God exists. For, one has such evidence only conditionally on\nGod\u2019s existence\u2014but it is precisely entitlement to\nbelieve that God exists that is at issue (Kenny 1992, 71; Bishop and\nAijaz 2004). For a wider discussion of the possibility of religious\nknowledge that, inter alia, endorses the present point, see\nZagzebski 2010.\n",
