    "main_text": "Evolution and the Conditions for Natural Selection\n2. Evolution and the Conditions for Natural Selection\n\nPhilosophers and biologists have been concerned to state the\nconditions for evolution by natural selection, many because they take\nit that there is a single theory, evolutionary theory, that governs\nDarwin\u2019s process. In many ways, the attempt to state the\nconditions for natural selection is a typical philosophical\nundertaking. We know, for instance, that confirmatory evidence may be\nused to raise our confidence in what it confirms and this recognition\nspawns a debate over what, exactly, should count as confirmation (see\nentry on\n confirmation).\n Similarly, Darwin\u2019s theory shows how some natural phenomena may\nbe explained (including at least adaptations and speciation), and thus it is a\nsimilar philosophical concern to state exactly when the deployment of\nthe theory is licensed. Such a statement would then issue in a verdict\non what, beyond the phenomena targeted by Darwin, is equally explicable\nusing his theory. Such a verdict could be used to arbitrate whether\nthe spread of cultural variations, \u201cmemes\u201d, is genuinely\nexplicable using the theory, as Dawkins (1982) suggested. The\nmammalian immune system may equally involve dynamics that are\nexplicable as selection processes (see section 4.1 of the entry on\n replication and reproduction).\n Zurek (2009) has even defended using the theory to explain phenomena\nin quantum mechanics.\n\nHere are the three principles that form the \u201clogical\nskeleton\u201d of \u201cDarwin\u2019s argument\u201d, according to\nLewontin (1970: 1):\n\nDifferent individuals in a population have different morphologies,\nphysiologies, and behaviors (phenotypic variation). \nDifferent phenotypes have different rates of survival and\nreproduction in different environments (differential fitness).\nThere is a correlation between parents and offspring in the\ncontribution of each to future generations (fitness is heritable)\n\n\nLewontin\u2019s principles invoke, implicitly or explicitly, a number\nof causal processes, including development, reproduction, survival,\nand inheritance. Though it is controversial whether Lewontin succeeds,\nclearly his three principles aim to capture at least what is\nsufficient for a cycle of evolutionary change by natural selection,\nsomething which, if repeated, could be used to explain adaptation and\nspeciation.\n\nLewontin\u2019s 1970 statement of the requirements for selection\nshould be contrasted with a similar statement in a later work, in\nwhich that author once again states that \u201cthe theory of\nevolution by natural selection\u201d rests on three principles:\n\n\nDifferent individuals within a species differ from one another in\nphysiology, morphology, and behavior (the principle of variation); the\nvariation is in some way heritable, so that on the average offspring\nresemble their parents more than they resemble other individuals (the\nprinciple of heredity); different variants leave different numbers of\noffspring either immediately or in remote generations (the principle\nof natural selection). (Lewontin 1978: 220)\n\n\nThis later statement is in many ways similar to the earlier one, but\nthere are some crucial differences in the formulations. According to\nthe later article, the different individuals must be within the same\nspecies, and it is phenotypic variations, rather than fitness, that\nmust be inherited. Many authors have echoed Lewontin\u2019s\ninfluential principles (see Godfrey-Smith (2007) for a thorough\nreview); for markedly different approach to formalizing the theory,\nsee Tennant (2014)).\n\nLewontin\u2019s conditions have been criticized from many directions.\nFor one thing, they make no mention of the populations in which\nselection occurs, and though the second set of conditions refers to\nspecies, all the members of a single species may not form a single\npopulation for the purposes of applying selection theory. Populations\nmust be appropriately circumscribed for some of the key vocabulary of\nevolutionary theory (focused selection, drift) to be deployed in a\nnon-arbitrary fashion (Millstein 2009). Lewontin\u2019s formulations\nalso make no mention of the struggle for existence, a seminal notion\nfor Darwin (see discussion in Lennox & Wilson 1994). The\nprinciples have also been subject to counterexamples. On the one hand,\nauthors put forward cases of evolving populations that fail to meet\nLewontin\u2019s conditions. Earnshaw-White (2012) puts forward a\npopulation in which offspring do not inherit their parents\u2019\ntraits, but whose members exhibit differential survival such that the\npopulation will evolve to a stable equilibrium. Equally, differential\nheritability may lead to evolutionary change without differential\nfitness (Earnshaw-White 2012; but see Bourrat 2015). Despite failing\nto meet Lewontin\u2019s conditions, populations will evolve that\nfeature variants that differ not in average offspring number, but only\nin generation time, such that one variant reproduces twice as fast as\nthe other (Godfrey-Smith 2007: 495). On the other hand, authors put\nforward cases of systems that fail to evolve despite meeting\nLewontin\u2019s conditions. A system exhibiting stabilizing\nselection, such that it tends to evolve toward an equilibrium state\nwhere multiple variants remain within the population, may meet either\nset of Lewontin\u2019s conditions despite failing to evolve\n(Godfrey-Smith 2007: 504). Counterexamples of these sorts depend upon\nthe assumption that we can tell whether a system is undergoing\nselection without applying any set of criteria for doing so (see\nJantzen 2019 for a discussion of how a Lewontin-style approach to\nwhether a system undergoes selection is question-begging).\n\nOkasha makes an important point about the intransitivity of covariance\nthat is relevant to Lewontin\u2019s principles. Okasha writes that Lewontin\u2019s last two conditions essentially require covariance\nbetween offspring number and parental character (Principle 2), along\nwith covariance between parental character and offspring character\n(Principle 3). (Here, Okasha is interpreting \u201cfitness\u201d in\nLewontin\u2019s conditions as offspring number rather than as a\nvariable in a formalism quantifying selection in its focused sense.)\nBoth those last two covariances might be positive without the system\nexhibiting an evolutionary response (as would occur if some of the\nparents with a given character have especially many offspring that do\nnot especially resemble them, while other parents with the same\ncharacter have offspring that especially resemble them but do not have\nespecially many of them). For a system to exhibit an evolutionary\nresponse, Okasha requires that the covariance between parental\noffspring number and average offspring character be positive (2006:\n37).\n\nOkasha\u2019s alternative condition is intended to replace a pair of\nLewontin\u2019s principles. Interestingly, Okasha further differs\nfrom Lewontin in allowing that systems that do not evolve may meet his\nrequirements. A system in which selection is exactly offset by\ntransmission bias will not evolve but will undergo natural selection,\naccording to Okasha (2006: 39).\n",
