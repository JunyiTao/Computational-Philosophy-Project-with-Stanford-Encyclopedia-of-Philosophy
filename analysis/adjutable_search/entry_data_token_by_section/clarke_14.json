    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Revelation and the Four Categories of Deism\n4.5 Revelation and the Four Categories of Deism\n\nClarke is very confident in the prospects of general revelation; that\nis, he thinks that human reason is capable of discovering the\nexistence and attributes of God by reasoning from the evidence of\nnature. Indeed, Clarke believes that Christianity presupposes natural\nreligion (W 4.582). Many theological and ethical truths (e.g., there\nis a God, God is to be worshiped, it is good to be just and righteous)\nare plainly understandable to everyone, and if one is mistaken in\nthese matters \u201c\u2019tis not by his Understanding, but\nby his Will that he is deceived.\u201d Yet it is very common\nto oppose these truths; the most common causes are \u201ca\npresumptuous Ignorance, which despises\nKnowledge\u201d; carelessness, which leads to blindly following local\ncustoms; prejudice, which is relying implicitly on others and\ntraditions rather than an examination of the evidence; and vice, a\nwillful opposition to the truth due to the love of wickedness,\ndebauchery, and power (W 2.147\u2013160). The reasoned defense of\nnatural religion, although perhaps unable to sway the prejudiced, was\ncentral to Clarke\u2019s project.\n\nClarke thought deists could be convinced to abandon their position\nbecause deism is unstable. In Clarke\u2019s taxonomy, there are four\ncategories of deists (W 2.600ff). The first category of deist say they\nbelieve in \u201can Eternal, Infinite, Independent, Intelligent\nBeing\u201d that made the world, but this God is not involved in the\ngoverning of the world nor does God care for what happens in it. In\nresponse, Clarke argues (1) that the best science of the day has shown\nthat the nature of matter is insufficient to ground the laws by which\nmatter acts and thus requires the continuous dependence upon its\nCreator, and (2) a God that isn\u2019t concerned for what happens in\nthe world must be lacking in knowledge of what is happening, power to\naffect what is happening, ability to act in the world, or wisdom to\nknow that intervention is needed, and thus is not the God that the\ndeist claimed to accept. The second category accept providential\naction in the world, but deny that God has moral attributes; ethics is\na matter of human construction. They fail to see, thinks Clarke, (1)\nthat ethics is a matter of eternal, fixed relations and (2) that to\ndeny the moral attributes of God entails the denial of either\nGod\u2019s wisdom or power. The third group of deists affirm\nGod\u2019s moral attributes, but they deny the immortality of the\nhuman soul and that moral terms apply univocally between God and\nhumans, which in practice leads to the denial of a future state after\ndeath. Clarke claims that this explodes all the attributes of God so\nthat we no longer know what we are saying when we talk about God.\nFinally, some deists hold all the right theological and ethical\ndoctrines, but claim that they know this solely on the basis of\ngeneral revelation and thus have no need of a special, Christian\nrevelation. Clarke suspects that this fourth category of deists no\nlonger exist in lands where Christianity has reached.\n",
