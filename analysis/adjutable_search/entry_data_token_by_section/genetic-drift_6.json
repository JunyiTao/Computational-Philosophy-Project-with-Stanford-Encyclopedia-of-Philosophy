Intersection of Genetic Drift with Statisticalist-Causalist Debates\n\nRecent debates about random drift are often entangled with debates\nover the purported purely statistical (non-causal) nature of\nevolutionary biology, but the issues are separable. There are issues\nconcerning random drift that do not involve questions of\nstatisticalism (as this article seeks to document), and there are\nissues concerning statisticalism that do not involve random drift\n(e.g., much of the literature focuses on natural selection rather than\nrandom drift). The statisticalist claim, generally traced to a pair of\npapers by Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew (2002) and Matthen and Ariew\n(2002), is essentially that evolution is a population-level\nphenomenon, and that although there are causes at the level of\nindividual organisms (births, deaths, etc.), there are no causes at\nthe population level, only a statistical summary of the individual\nevents. Note that it is widely acknowledged that the models in\nevolutionary theory are statistical ones, so the distinctive\nstatisticalist claim is that evolutionary biology is purely\nstatistical. There are at least three alternatives to the\nstatisticalist claim; one challenges the claim that evolutionary\nbiology is a population-level phenomenon, arguing that it is\nconstituted by causes at the level of individual organisms (e.g.,\nBouchard and Rosenberg 2004), a second defends the view that there are\npopulation-level causes (e.g., Millstein 2006; Shapiro and Sober\n2007), while a third argues for causes at both levels (Pence\n2017).\n\nIt was already noted above (see\n section 2.3)\n that the outcome-only definition of drift is often adopted by\nstatisticalists, but not exclusively so; it can also be endorsed by a\ncausalist who, e.g., believes that natural selection is a causal\nprocess but that drift is simply deviation from selective\nexpectations. Perhaps surprisingly, it would also be possible for\nsomeone to endorse a version of the Causal Process Account of Drift\nand yet still accept the basic statisticalist premise\u2014if one\nthought that drift should be understood in terms of indiscriminate\nsampling, and also thought that indiscriminate sampling should be\nunderstood in terms of causes at the level of individual organisms,\nthen the evolutionary changes wrought by drift would just be be the\nstatistical summation of individual level causes. In short, it would\nbe a mistake to infer one\u2019s position on the statisticalist\ndebate from one\u2019s definition of drift, although such slippage is\ncommon and the issues are in truth often entangled.\n\nWhat, then, are the statisticalist issues that random drift is\nentangled with? The concerns raised by Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew (2002)\nand Matthen and Ariew (2002) have their origins in claims made by\nSober (1984) in his classic The Nature of Selection. Sober\ncharacterizes evolutionary theory as a theory of forces, with its\nzero-force state described by the Hardy-Weinberg equation of\npopulation genetics (see the\n population genetics entry\n for an explanation of the equation); in such a state, there is no\nselection, no mutation, no migration, no meiotic drive, random mating,\nand infinite population size. Thus, the Hardy-Weinberg equation is an\nidealized model that never obtains in the real world. It is a bit\ndifficult to see where drift fits into the equation, which is no doubt\nthe source of much of the confusion over how to define drift. In his\n1984 book, Sober alternatively characterizes drift in terms of random\nsampling (the process, which occurs, Sober explains, during gamete\nformation and the founding of new populations) and sampling error (the\noutcome, i.e., the deviation from fitness expectations). From the\npoint of view of process, at least some types of sampling could be\nunderstood to be part of the Mendelian process. The Mendelian process\nincludes the \u201cprocess wherein organism produce gametes and\ngametes produce organisms\u201d (Sober 1984: 35), which Sober says is\nnot treated as a force, but rather as the background against which\nevolutionary forces are described. But Sober does not take this route.\nInstead, Sober contrasts drift as sampling error (again, the\noutcome\u2014presumably introduced when one relaxes Hardy-Weinberg\nassumptions to allow for finite populations) with selection, mutation,\nand migration; all are forces, Sober asserts, but drift is a different\nsort of force. It is not \u201cdeterministic\u201d and it does not\nhave a definite direction (although it does have a magnitude,\ndetermined by the population size). That is, given trait frequencies\nand fitness values, Sober suggests, selection predicts a specific\noutcome for the next generation in a specific direction (and is in\nthis sense \u201cdeterministic\u201d), whereas drift could yield an\nincrease any of the types present in the population (and is in this\nsense directionless). Moreover, Sober states, you cannot say how\nmuch drift has contributed a change relative to the change\nintroduced by selection; to do so would be as impossible as trying to\nsay, when flipping a fair coin ten times and obtaining six heads, how\nmuch of the result was due to the fairness of the coin and how much\nwas due to the fact that it was tossed ten times. He thus concludes\nthat \u201cif drift is an evolutionary force, it is a force of a\ndifferent color\u201d (1984: 117); he calls it a force, he says,\nmainly to indicate its causal role.\n\nThese metaphysical claims about drift (and selection and other\nevolutionary processes\u2014but it is just drift that interests us\nhere) set the stage for the statisticalists\u2019 challenge. Matthen\nand Ariew (2002) challenge the claim that there is a defensible sense\nin which drift is a force. Aside from the fact that it does not have a\npredictable or constant direction (as Sober readily acknowledges),\nthey point to a case of two similar populations subject to the same\nselective pressures, one in which the trait \\(T\\) becomes fixed and\nthe other in which the alternative trait \\(T'\\) becomes\nfixed. What explains the outcome in the two cases? Exactly the same\nthing, Matthen and Ariew assert, just as exactly the same coin setup\nexplains two heads and four heads in two series of ten coin tosses.\nThus, they seem to suggest, there is no additional cause or force,\n\u201cdrift\u201d. Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew (2002) similarly attack\nSober\u2019s claim that drift is a force; following Rosenberg (1994),\nthey assert that \u201cthe events that are labelled\n\u2018drift\u2019 events, like lightning strikes, etc. are no\ndifferent in kind from selection events\u201d (Walsh, Lewens, and\nAriew 2002: 457)\u2014and thus, drift is not a distinct sort of\nforce. Moreover, they argue, drift is best interpreted statistically\nas statistical error (see argument in\n section 2.3),\n and so again, it is not a force.\n\nTo be clear, there is a historical component to the\nstatisticalists\u2019 claims; on their view, Darwin\u2019s\nevolutionary theory was causal, but with the introduction of\npopulation genetics, evolution became purely statistical. (It is\nsometimes unclear whether the statisticalists are making claims about\nmodels/theories or whether they are making ontological claims, or\nwhether they think that the latter can be inferred from the former).\nHodge (2016; see also Plutynski et al. 2016) challenges this\nhistorical claim by arguing that in fact Darwin\u2014although he\nliked to think that his epistemological and nomological ideals were in\ndescent from Newton\u2019s\u2014never understood natural selection\nto be a lawful force along with gravitation or inertia. Hodge further\nargues that biologists today compare and contrast natural selection\nwith artificial selection and with drift in ways directly descending\nfrom Darwin\u2019s view of natural selection as a causal process.\n\nA number of other philosophers have sought to challenge the\nstatisticalists\u2019 claim that drift is not a force. For example,\nStephens (2004) defends the claim that drift is both a force and a\ncause. He asserts that if we understand drift properly as a process of\nindiscriminate sampling (instead of as an outcome, as the\nstatisticalists do), we can see that it is a force, but that in a\npopulation of a given size it always has the same force,\nregardless of whether there is a large or a small deviation from\nexpectation. (It may be that Sober\u2019s inadvertent vagueness in\nhis 1984 book on the process/outcome question contributed to the\nconfusion, since the statisticalists were responding to Sober). He\nclarifies that, \u201cbecause drift is a probabilistic cause, the\nsame causal force can have two different\noutcomes\u201d (Stephens 2004: 557; emphasis in original). Stephens\nfurther defends the claim that drift can be understood as a force or a\ncause by arguing (contra Matthen and Ariew) that drift does\nhave a direction, namely, eliminating heterozygosity; that it can\n\u201cmake a difference\u201d by affecting the probability of\nevolutionary change (more in small populations, less in large); and\nthat we can cogently speak of the relative importance of drift in an\nensemble of populations or in a population, albeit not at the level of\nindividuals (see Walsh 2007 for a response to Stephens 2004, 2010 and\nGildenhuys 2014 for a response to his response).\n\nBrandon (2006), however, argues that \u201celiminating\nheterozygosity\u201d is not sufficient to show that drift is\ndirectional, given that (as Stephens would readily acknowledge) if\nthere were two alleles at a locus, beginning at equal frequencies, we\ncould not predict which of the two alleles would go to fixation, only\nthat one of them would; Brandon likens this to saying that \u201ca\n20-Newton force is acting on object A\u201d, (2006: 325),\nwhich, he seems to imply, is not a directional claim. Moreover, he\nargues, drift is not a separate process from selection. Thus, drift,\non Brandon\u2019s view, is not a force (but it is a law; more on that\nbelow). Joshua Filler (2009) responds to Brandon by defending a more\nelaborated account of what a force is (in part drawing on Bigelow et\nal. 1988); on that elaborated account, drift\u2019s direction can be\nseen as less specific than selection, mutation, and migration, but it\ngives some directional information. Thus, Filler argues, it can be\nseen as less \u201cforcelike\u201d than selection, mutation, and\nmigration, but it is still a force. Charles Pence (2017), however,\nworries that Filler\u2019s modifications to our understanding of\n\u201cforce\u201d may be ad hoc, so he offers an\nalternative defense of the claim that drift is a force. First, Pence\nargues, we already countenance forces that have stochastically\nspecified directions, such as Brownian motion, and drift is analogous.\nSecond, we can create an evolutionary thought experiment where drift\nis absent, showing that it is not constitutive of all evolving\nsystems; this is intended to respond to Brandon\u2019s claim that\ndrift is not separable. Importantly, however, Pence points out that\nthere are essential questions that the entire debate has yet to\naddress: \u201cwhat exactly the use of \u2018forces\u2019 is to do\nfor us, and when explanations utilizing a force metaphor are useful or\nperspicuous\u201d (Pence 2017: 1975).\n\nOn the other hand, Kenneth Reisman and Patrick Forber (2005) separate\nthe question of whether drift is a force from the question of whether\ndrift is a cause, arguing only for the latter while not taking a stand\non the former. In a related paper, they rely on Woodward\u2019s\n(2003) manipulability account of causation and a 1957 study of drift\nby Dobzhansky and Pavlovsky to argue that\n\n\ndecreasing the number of founding members in replicate populations\nproduces an increase in the variability of evolutionary outcomes\nacross those replicate populations. (Forber and Reisman 2007: 617)\n\n\nIn other words, they argue that the conditions of the study can be\nseen to satisfy the conditions of the manipulability account, showing\nthat drift ought to be understood as a (population-level) cause.\nShapiro and Sober (2007) state that they endorse Reisman and\nForber\u2019s arguments as well as the view of drift as a process.\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear whether Shapiro and Sober (or Reisman and\nForber) actually do endorse the view of drift as a process. That is,\nit\u2019s unclear why population size as a causal factor should count\nas a process.\n\nThis is because it\u2019s a bit unclear if drift is actually what is\nbeing manipulated in Dobzhansky and Pavlovsky\u2019s (1957)\nexperiments, or if it is just population size\u2014and population\nsize does not seem to be a process. Perhaps Reisman and Forber have\nsimply shown that population size is a causal factor of evolutionary\nchange in populations undergoing drift. They also seem to be taking\nWoodward\u2019s account very literally, in that they seem to think\nthat the \u201cvariable\u201d that has to be manipulated must be a\nvariable in a mathematical model; otherwise, one could (at least in\nprinciple) manipulate the sampling process by manipulating the\npopulation rather than simply the population size; Clatterbuck\u2019s\n(2015) account, discussed in\n section 5,\n gives an example of this. (Population size is a variable in\nmathematical models of drift, whereas sampling, as discussed above, is\nimplicit). One could also conceivably manipulate the environment so\nthat sampling was discriminate rather than indiscriminate or to change\nthe nature of the indiscriminate sampling.\n\nPierrick Bourrat (2018) offers an alternative response to Reisman and\nForber; he implies that Reisman and Forber (2005) have overlooked\nWoodward\u2019s criterion of invariance when they invoke the\nmanipulability account in support of drift as a population-level\ncause.  Invariance in an intervention, Bourrat states,\n\u201cmeasures the extent to which a relationship between two\nvariables satisfying the manipulation condition remains stable or\nunchanged as various other changes are made in the background of this\nrelationship\u201d (2018: 162), and, again invoking Woodward, he\nasserts that causal relationships that are more invariant provide\nbetter explanations. But, Bourrat argues, causal explanations in terms\nof individual-level variables are more invariant under intervention\nthan causal explanations in terms of population-level variables, and\nthus should be preferred for that reason. In other words, similar to\nBouchard and Rosenberg (2004) who are briefly mentioned above, Bourrat\ndefends a causalist position, but at the level of individuals rather\nthan at the level of populations. However, Bourrat does concede that\nit is reasonable to conceive of drift and natural selection as\npopulation-level causes when they depend on indeterministic events, as\nwell as for some cases of frequency-dependent selection. Moreover,\nBourrat does not discuss Clatterbuck\u2019s (2015) alternative and\narguably superior understanding of the relevant manipulation for\ndrift; had he done so, it is not clear that his claim for the\nsuperiority of individual-level causal explanations with respect to\ndrift would follow. Again, though, these are disagreements within the\ncausalist camp.\n\nOther challenges to the statisticalists\u2019 claims about drift as a\ncause neither endorse the view of drift as a force nor drift as a\ndistinct process. For example, Brandon and Ramsey (2007) see drift and\nselection as \u201ccopossible\u201d outcomes of the same process.\nBut because there is a causal process\u2014albeit only one\nrather than two\u2014the statisticalists\u2019 claims are not\nupheld. Abrams (2007) likewise seems loathe to adopt\n\u201cforce\u201d talk about drift, at least in a strong realist\nsense. He argues that \u201cboth selection and drift are aspects of a\nprobability distribution over future frequencies of genotypes or\nphenotypes in a population\u201d (2007: 667). Yet selection and drift\ncan be distinguished:\n\n\nSelection is the aspect of the distribution controlled by differences\nin fitness, while drift is the aspect of such a distribution\ncontrolled by population size (apart any from effects of population\nsize on fitness). (2007: 667)\n\n\nThis makes it sound as though Abrams is adopting a view of drift akin\nto that of Reisman and Forber, with its focus on population size, and\nindeed Abrams does elaborate on the causal role of population size,\nbut (as noted above) his views on drift are more accurately pluralist\nones.\n\nMore generally, Pence (2017) suggests one way of categorizing the\ndifferent causalist approaches (although not all of these have\nexplicitly addressed drift):\n\n\nAt the very least, we need to distinguish between (1) the force\ninterpretation, as discussed here; (2) the causal process approach\n(elaborated most notably by Millstein 2002, 2006, 2013); (3) the\ncausal mechanism approach, first deployed for natural selection by\nBarros (2008) and building on the work of Machamer et al. (2000); (4)\nthe manipulationist approach, discussed by Reisman and Forber (2005),\nForber and Reisman (2007), and Shapiro and Sober (2007), building on\nthe work of Woodward and Hitchcock (2003); and (5) the counterfactual\napproach, deployed for natural selection by Glennan (2009) and Huneman\n(2012) and utilizing a notion of counterfactual causal dependence or\n\u201crelevance\u201d.
