    "main_text": "Intention and Specification || Definitions and Specifications\n2.2 Definitions and Specifications\n\nConsider the\u00a0example of the call filtering app again;\u00a0a\nspecification may require to create a black-list of phone numbers\nassociated with call centers; to update the list every n\ndays; to check, upon an incoming call, whether the number is on the\nblack-list; to communicate\u00a0to the call management system not to\nallow the incoming call in case of an affirmative answer, and to allow\nthe call in case of negative answer.\n\nThe latter is a full-fledged specification, though expressed in a\nnatural language. Specifications are often advanced in a natural\nlanguage to be closer to the stakeaholder\u2019s intentions and only\nsubsequently they are\u00a0formalized in a proper formal language.\nSpecifications may be expressed by means of graphical languages such\nas UML (Fowler 2003), or more formal languages such as TPL (Turner\n2009a) and VDM (Jones 1990), using predicate logic, or Z (Woodcock and\nDavies 1996), focusing on set theory. For instance, Type Predicate\nLogic (TPL) expresses the requirements of computational systems using\npredicate logic formulas, wherein the type of the quantified variables\nis specified. The choice of the variable types allows one to define\nspecifications at the more appropriate abstraction level. Whether\nspecifications are expressed in an informal or formal guise often\ndepends on the development method followed, with formal specifications\nusually preferred in the context of formal development methods.\nMoreover, formal specifications facilitate verification of correctness\nfor computational systems (see\n \u00a76).\n\nTurner (2018) asks what difference is there between models and\nspecifications, both of which are extensively used in computer\nscience. The difference is located in what Turner (2011) calls the\nintentional stance: models describe an intended\nsystem to be developed and, in case of a mismatch between the two, the\nmodels are to be refined; specifications prescribe how the\nsystem is to be built so as to comply with the intended functions, and\nin case of mismatch it is the system that needs to be refined.\nMatching between model and system reflects a correspondence between\nintentions \u2014 describing what system is to be\nconstructed in terms of the computational problem the system must be\nable to solve \u2014 and specifications \u2014 determining\nhow the system is to be constructed, in terms of the set of\nrequirements necessary for solving the computational problem, as\nexemplified for the call filtering app. In Turner\u2019s (2011)\nwords, \u201csomething is a specification when it is given\ncorrectness jurisdiction over an artefact\u201d: specifications\nprovide correctness criteria for computational systems. Computational\nsystems are thus correct when they comply with their specifications,\nthat is, when they behave according to them. Conversely, they provide\ncriteria of malfunctioning\n (\u00a77.3):\n a computational system malfunctions when it does not behave\nconsistently with its specifications. Turner (2011) is careful to\nnotice that such a definition of specifications is an idealization:\nspecifications are themselves revised in some cases, such as when the\nspecified computational systems cannot be realized because of physical\nlaws constraints or cost limitations, or when it turns out that the\nadvanced specifications are not correct formalizations of the\nintentions of clients and users.\n\nMore generally, the correctness problem does not only deal with\nspecifications, but with any two LoAs defining computational systems,\nas the next subsection will examine.\n",
