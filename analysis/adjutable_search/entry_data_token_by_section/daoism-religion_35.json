    "main_text": "\u201cNourishing Life\u201d || Practices\n8.1 Practices\n\nYangsheng or Nourishing Life is the general designation of a\nvariety of practices designed to benefit the body (Engelhardt 2000).\nThe term is so indefinite that no precise list can be drawn of what\npertains to \u201cnourishing life\u201d. Nevertheless, relevant\nmethods would certainly include daoyin, breathing, and sexual\npractices. Present-day practices often defined as\n\u201cDaoist\u201d, such as Qigong and Taiji quan,\nmay also be seen as belonging to Yangsheng.\n\nDaoyin (lit., \u201cguiding and pulling\u201d; Despeux\n1989; Kohn 2008) can be defined, in Western terms, as a sort of\ngymnastics, in the sense that it grants physical agility and\ncoordination. In a different reference frame, its formal features and\nits place in Daoism bear analogies to what hatha yoga is in Hinduism.\nThe purpose of daoyin postures and movements is to allow the\nunhindered flow of qi within the body. The practice is known\nto have existed at least by the 3rd or 2nd\ncentury BCE (trans. of a Mawangdui manuscript, Harper 1998:\n310\u201327). Only one text on daoyin is found in the Daoist\nCanon (trans. Kohn 2012, in a chapter oddly entitled \u201cInternal\nAlchemy\u201d).\n\nBreathing practices exist in many varieties. The most common general\nterms are xingqi (\u201ccirculating breath\u201d) and\ntuna (\u201cexhaling [the old] and inhaling [the new\nbreath]\u201d). Particular practices include biqi\n(\u201cretaining breath\u201d), buqi (\u201cspreading\nbreath\u201d), lianqi (\u201crefining breath\u201d), and\ntiaoqi (\u201charmonizing breath\u201d). Another celebrated\nterm is zhongxi (\u201cbreathing through the heels\u201d),\nused in the Zhuangzi to designate the spontaneous breathing of\nthe realized person, which does not stop at the lungs but circulates\nthroughout the entire body (ch. 6; Watson 1968: 78). Two especially\nimportant practices are the ingestion of the \u201cbreaths\u201d of\nthe four directions (Raz 2013), and the so-called \u201cembryonic\nbreathing\u201d (taixi), which purports to replicate the\nbreathing of an embryo in its womb (Maspero 1981: 459\u2013505).\n\nSexual practices are commonly defined in Chinese as fangzhong\nshu or \u201carts of the bedroom\u201d (Maspero 1981:\n517\u201341). The large amount of literature existing on this subject\nshows that these arts are, with few exceptions, primarily addressed to\nmales (another common term that defines them is yun\u00fc,\n\u201criding women\u201d). Their main purpose is to avoid\nejaculation: semen should be prevented from being emitted and should\ninstead be \u201creturned to the brain\u201d (which is deemed to be\nthe origin of the marrow, in its turn the source of semen). This\nmethod is known as huangjing bunao, \u201creverting the\nessence to replenish the brain\u201d.\n",
