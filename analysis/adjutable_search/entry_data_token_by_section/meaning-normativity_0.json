    "main_text": "Interpretations of the Normativity Thesis || Metaphysical Questions\n1.1 Metaphysical Questions\n\nNormativism is a claim about the nature of meaning/content.\nAccording to normativism, there cannot be meaning/content without\nnorms, where the impossibility is metaphysical, conceptual, or both. A\nfirst question thus is: which is prior\u2014norms or\nmeanings/contents?\n\nRead metaphysically, the question is: Are certain norms valid, or in\nforce, because certain things such as linguistic expressions\nand intentional states have certain meanings/contents? Or do such\nthings have meaning/content because some norms are in force?\nWe shall distinguish between meaning/content\n\u201cengendered\u201d (ME/CE) normativity and\nmeaning/content determining (MD/CD) normativity (cf.\nGl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2009). MD/CD norms are such that they\nmetaphysically determine, ground, or constitute meaning/content; here,\nthe norms are prior. ME/CE normativity is normativity engendered by,\nor consequent upon, meaning/content, regardless of how the latter is\n determined.[1]\n\nMD/CD normativism aims at answering \u201cfoundational\u201d\nquestions and providing metaphysical explanation: In virtue of what do\nlinguistic expressions/intentional states have meaning/content?\nMetaphysical explanation of \\(X\\) by means of \\(Y\\) requires that\n\\(X\\) at least supervenes upon\n \\(Y\\).[2]\n Supervenience relations involve three elements: a set of supervenient\nentities \\(S_E\\), a set of entities forming the supervenience base\n\\(S_B\\), and a principle according to which what is in \\(S_B\\)\ndetermines what is in \\(S_E\\) (a function from \\(S_B\\) to \\(S_E)\\).\nWhether supervenience suffices for metaphysical explanation or not, an\nexplanation will therefore not be complete unless the principle of\ndetermination is\n specified.[3]\n When it comes to meaning, this is arguably one of the most important\nlessons of Wittgenstein\u2019s so-called rule-following\nconsiderations; as long as only the supervenience base is specified,\nits elements can be mapped onto meanings in any old way, thus leaving\nmeaning completely indeterminate (cf. Pagin 2002, Gl\u00fcer\n 2018).[4]\n",
