    "main_text": "Epistemological and Metaphysical Issues || Neurofunctional Accounts\n4.5 Neurofunctional Accounts\n\nSome philosophers have sought more specific grounding in the\nneurosciences for their accounts of consciousness.  Block (2005)\npursues a strategy of using tentative functional characterizations of\nphenomenal and access consciousness to interpret evidence from the\nsearch by neuroscientists for neural correlates of consciousness. He\nargues, on the basis of evidence from both humans and monkeys, that\nrecurrent feedback activity in sensory cortex is the most plausible\ncandidate for being the neural correlate of phenomenal consciousness\nin these species.  Prinz (2005) also pursues a neurofunctional\naccount, but identifies phenomenal consciousness with a different\nfunctional role than Block.  He argues for identifying phenomenal\nconsciousness with brain processes that are involved in attention to\nintermediate-level perceptual representations which feed into working\nmemory via higher level, perspective-invariant representations. Since\nthe evidence for such processes is at least partially derived from\nanimals, including other primates and rats, his view is supportive of\nthe idea that phenomenal consciousness is found in some nonhuman\nspecies (presumably most mammals). Nevertheless, he maintains that it\nmay be impossible ever to answer the Distribution Question for more\ndistantly related species; he mentions octopus, pigeons, bees, and\nslugs in this context.\n",
