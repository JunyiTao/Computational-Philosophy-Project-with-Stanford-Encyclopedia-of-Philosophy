    "main_text": "Slow Switching Arguments || Reply 5: Anti-Recognitionalism\n3.5 Reply 5: Anti-Recognitionalism\n\nA more programmatic critique of slow switch arguments resists its\nassimilation of self-knowledge to perceptual knowledge. In particular,\nthe complaint is that slow switch arguments mistakenly assume that,\nfor Oscar to know what he is thinking, he must recognize what\nhe is thinking on the basis of some \u201cinward observation.\u201d\nSlow switch arguments then exploit the fact that what would be\n\u201cobserved\u201d is compatible with more than one thought\ncontent. However, for one kind of compatibilist, such\n\u201crecognitional\u201d models of self-knowledge are largely in\nerror. According to her, self-knowledge is unlike perceptual knowledge\nin that it is not normally the product of any kind of recognition\n(though she need not deny the existence of introspection altogether).\nSome even take slow switch arguments as positive evidence for the\nanti-recognitional view of self-knowledge (e.g., Moran 2001, p.\n15).\n\n\u201cAnti-recognitionalist\u201d compatibilism can be developed in\na number of ways. We have already seen some precedent in Burge\nvis-\u00e0-vis self-verifying judgments (section\n 3.1).\n For these judgments do not represent a \u201ccognitive\nachievement\u201d (in the words of Boghossian 1989); they are\nautomatically self-verifying, whether the subject invests any\nepistemic effort in them or not. Anti-recognitionalism has also arisen\nin W.\u2019s notion of \u201cdefault\u201d entitlement (from\nsection\n 2.3).\n For W., a subject does not need a tight philosophical argument to be\nentitled to her self-attributions; such entitlement is granted\nautomatically (unless there is special reason to withhold it).\n\nA variety of other anti-recognitionalist views exist. E.g., there is a\nneo-expressivist view which is gaining prominence (Bar-On & Long\n2001, Finkelstein 2003, Bar-On 2004; 2006; 2011; 2012a, b; 2103,\nParent 2017, ch. 8). There are also views which utilize\nagency-theoretic ideas to explain self-knowledge (Moran 2001, Heal\n2002, Bilgrami 2006, O\u2019Brien 2007, Coliva 2009). The interested\nreader is encouraged to visit the entry on\n self-knowledge\n for more.\n",
