    "main_text": "Mechanism and Synthesis || Mechanistic Explanations in Chemistry\n5.1 Mechanistic Explanations in Chemistry\n\nThere has been a profusion of discussion in the literatures of\nphilosophy of biology and philosophy of neuroscience about the notion\nof mechanisms and mechanistic explanations (e.g., Machamer, Darden,\n& Craver 2000). Yet the production of mechanisms as explanatory\nschemes finds its original home in chemistry, especially organic\nchemistry. Chemical mechanisms are used to classify reactions into\ntypes, to explain chemical behavior, and to make predictions about\nnovel reactions or reactions taking place in novel circumstances\n(Weininger 2014).\n\nGoodwin (2012) identifies two notions of chemical mechanism at play in\nchemistry. The first or thick notion of mechanism is like a\nmotion picture of a chemical reaction. Such a mechanism traces out the\npositions of all of the electrons and atomic cores of some set of\nmolecules during the course of a reaction, and correlates these\npositions to the potential energy or free energy of the system. One\nmight think of this as an ideal reaction mechanism, as it would\ncontain all information about the time course of a chemical\nreaction.\n\nIn contrast, the thin notion of a reaction mechanism focuses\non a discrete set of steps. In each step, a set of reactive\nintermediates are generated. These intermediates are quasi-stable\nmolecular species that will ultimately yield the products of the\nreaction. For example, the much studied biomolecular nucleophilic\nsubstitution (SN2) reaction is said to have a single\nreactive intermediate with the incoming nucleophile and outgoing\nleaving group both partially bonded to the reactive carbon center (see\nFigure 6). Such a description of the reaction mechanism is not only\nabstract in that it leaves out much detail, but it is also highly\nidealized. Reactions do not take actually place as a series of\ndiscrete steps, each of which generates a quasi-stable reaction\nintermediate.\n\n\nFigure 6. Thin reaction mechanism for the SN2 reaction.\n\n\nWhile most textbook treatments of reaction mechanisms begin by\nmentioning the thick notion, the details nearly always turn to thin\nnotions of mechanism. At the same time, formal theoretical treatments\nof reaction mechanisms deal exclusively with the thick notion. Such\ntreatments often attempt to calculate the potential energy function\nfor the reaction from quantum mechanics. Given the importance of the\nthick notion to formal chemical theorizing, why does the thin notion\ndominate the practice of chemistry and find expression in textbooks\nand research articles?\n\nPart of the reason that thin reaction mechanisms are widely used is\nthat determining thick reaction mechanisms is essentially impossible\nexperimentally, and extremely difficult theoretically. But this cannot\nbe the whole story because when necessary, chemists have been able to\nproduce relevant portions of the thick mechanism.\n\nAlternatively, Goodwin (2012, p. 311) has argued that, given the\nexplanatory and predictive goals of chemists, not all of the thick\nmechanism is needed. In fact, only a characterization of specific\nstructures, the transition state and stable reactive intermediates,\nare necessary to produce chemical explanations and predictions.\nConstructing mechanisms as a discrete series of steps between stable\nand reactive structures allows the chemist:\n\n\u2026 to identify or specify which of those standard changes is\nacting as a \u201cbottleneck\u201d (or in chemical parlance, the\n\u201crate determining step\u201d) for the progression of the\nreaction \u2026 make it obvious where alternatives paths are and are\nnot available \u2026 [and] to infer something about the structures\nof the important intermediates in the particular reaction whose\nmechanism is being proposed (Goodwin 2012, p. 314).\n\n\nSo chemists\u2019 explanatory goals require that specific features of\nreaction mechanisms can be identified. The rest of the thick mechanism\nwouldn\u2019t necessarily add any explanatorily relevant detail to the\nexplanation.\n",
