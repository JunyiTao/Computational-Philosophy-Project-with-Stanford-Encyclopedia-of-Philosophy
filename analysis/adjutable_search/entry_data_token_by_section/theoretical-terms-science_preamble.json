    "main_text": "\n\nA simple explanation of theoreticity says that a term is theoretical\nif and only if it refers to nonobservational entities. Paradigmatic\nexamples of such entities are electrons, neutrinos, gravitational\nforces, genes etc. There is yet another explanation of theoreticity: a\ntheoretical term is one whose meaning becomes determined through the\naxioms of a scientific theory. The meaning of the term\n\u2018force\u2019, for example, is seen to be determined by\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion and further laws about special forces,\nsuch as the law of gravitation. Theoreticity is a property that is\ncommonly applied to both expressions in the language of science, and\nreferents and concepts of such expressions. Objects, relations and\nfunctions as well as concepts thereof may thus qualify as theoretical\nin a derived sense.\n\nSeveral semantics have been devised that aim to explain how a\nscientific theory contributes to the interpretation of its theoretical\nterms and as such determines what they mean and how they are\nunderstood. All of these semantics assume the respective theory to be\ngiven in an axiomatic fashion. Yet, theoretical terms are also\nrecognizable in scientific theories which have as yet resisted a\nsatisfying axiomatization.\n\nTheoretical terms pertain to a number of topics in the philosophy of\nscience. A fully fledged semantics of such terms commonly involves a\nstatement about scientific realism and its alternatives. Such a\nsemantics, moreover, may involve an account of how observation is\nrelated to theory in science. All formal accounts of theoretical terms\ndeny the analytic-synthetic distinction to be applicable to the axioms\nof a scientific theory. The recognition of theoretical terms in the\nlanguage of science by Carnap thus amounts to a rejection of an\nessential tenet of early logical empiricism and positivism, viz., the\ndemonstration that all empirically significant sentences are\ntranslatable into an observation language. The present article\nexplains the principal distinction between observational and\ntheoretical terms, discusses important criticisms and refinements of\nthis distinction and investigates two problems concerning the\nsemantics of theoretical terms. Finally, the major formal accounts of\nthis semantics are expounded.\n",
