    "main_text": "\n\nThe notion of justice as a virtue began in reference to a trait of\nindividuals, and to some extent remains so, even if today we often\nconceive the justice of individuals as having some (grounding)\nreference to social justice. But from the start, the focus on justice\nas a virtue faced pressures to diffuse, in two different ways.\n\nFirst, \u201cjustice as a virtue\u201d is ambiguous as between\nindividual and social applications. Rawls and others regard justice as\n\u201cthe first virtue of social institutions\u201d (1971, p. 3),\nbut Rawls is not the first to think of justice as a virtue of social\ninstitutions or societies \u2014 Plato was there long before him.\nHowever, justice as a virtue of societies, polities, and their\ninstitutions is addressed\n elsewhere,\n so the focus in this essay will be on justice as a virtue in\nindividuals. That said, individuals typically live as members of\npolitical communities, so the societal dimension of justice as a\nvirtue will never be long out of view (Woodruff 2018).\n\nSecond, from the start the effort to analyze the virtue of\njustice has led to attempts to formalize the requirements (or\nnorms) of justice, and at times the latter project has threatened to\nswallow the first in ways that make thinking of a virtue of\njustice gratuitous or otiose. We might be tempted to think that the\nvirtue of justice consists simply in compliance with the norms of\njustice our theory specifies: a just person will be one who complies\nwith the norms of justice, whether those are narrowly interpersonal or\nmore broadly social or political in scope. In this way the virtue\nbecomes subsidiary to norms of justice independently specified\n(Anderson 2010, p. 2; LeBar 2014). Doing so threatens to lose the\nforce that the notion of virtue had in the earliest thinking about\njustice. \n\nA further complication is that even the idea of justice as a virtue of\nindividuals seems ambiguous in regard to scope. Plato in the\nRepublic treats justice as an overarching virtue of both\nindividuals and societies, so that almost every issue he (or we) would\nregard as ethical comes in under the notion of justice. But in later\nusages justice covers only part of individual morality, and we\ndon\u2019t readily think of someone as unjust if they lie or\nneglect their children \u2014 other epithets more readily spring to\nmind. Individual justice first and most readily regards moral issues\nhaving to do with distributions of goods or property. It is, we say,\nunjust for someone to steal from people or not to give them what he\nowes them, and it is also unjust if someone called upon to distribute\nsomething good (or bad or both) among members of a group uses an\narbitrary or unjustified basis for making the distribution. Discussion\nof justice as an individual virtue often centers on questions,\ntherefore, about property and other distributable goods, though the\nbroader sense broached by Plato never entirely disappears. Still there\nis disagreement over whether the broader distributive questions\nassociated with political morality have subordinated or obscured the\nearlier Greek concerns with justice as a virtue of individual\ncharacter (Hursthouse 1999, pp. 5\u20136; Coope 2007; Lu 2017).\n",
