    "main_text": "The Ruler || The Ruler\u2019s Superiority\n5.1 The Ruler\u2019s Superiority\n\nThe principle of monarchism, namely the conviction that peace and\nstability are attainable only under a singular omnipotent sovereign,\ncan be considered the unifying thread of the Warring States-period\npolitical thought (Liu Zehua 2013\u201314; Pines 2009: 25\u2013107).\nThinkers of various ideological affiliations proposed ethical, ritual,\nand cosmological stipulations to monarchic rule. To these debates, the\nfa thinkers added primarily sociopolitical and administrative\ndimensions. In their eyes, the exclusive power of the monarch was the\nonly way to ensure proper functioning of society and the state. Shen\nDao clarifies:\n\n\nIn antiquity, the Son of Heaven was established and esteemed not in\norder to benefit the single person. It is said: When All under Heaven\nlacks the single esteemed [person], then there is no way to carry out\nthe principles [of orderly rule, li \u7406]. ... Hence the\nSon of Heaven is established for the sake of All under Heaven, it is\nnot that All under Heaven is established for the sake of the Son of\nHeaven. ... Even if the law is bad, it is better than absence of laws;\ntherewith the hearts of the people are unified. (Harris 2016: 110)\n\n\nShen Dao views the ruler as crucial for the proper functioning of the\npolitical system; he is the real foundation of political order, not a\nbeneficiary but rather a servant of humankind. He attains these\nblessed results by the sheer fact of his existence and not due to\npersonal morality or intelligence. According to Shen Dao, bad laws are\nbetter than a lawless situation, and we may infer that a bad ruler is\nbetter than anarchy.\n\nThe importance of the ruler in fa thought derives primarily\nfrom the mere singularity of his position. By being the ultimate locus\nof authority, the ruler imposes unity of action upon his officials.\nShen Dao explains: \u201cDoubts bring commotion; doubleness [of the\nsources of authority] brings contention, intermingling brings mutual\ninjury; harm is from sharing, not from singularity\u201d (Harris\n2016: 118). This is the rationale for concentrating all imaginable\npower in the sovereign\u2019s hands.\n\nAside from providing necessary unity to the political apparatus, the\nruler contributed to the fa project in additional ways. As\nthe story narrated in the first chapter, \u201cRevising the\nlaws,\u201d of the Book of Lord Shang clarifies, it was only\nthrough the ruler\u2019s endorsement that radical reforms could be\nlaunched against the entrenched opposition of conservative courtiers.\nBesides, the ruler, ex officio, represented the common interests of\nhis subjects (gong \u516c, recall that the same term\ndesignates a territorial lord). He embodied impartiality; without him,\nconflicting selfish interests will tear the polity apart.\n\nThis backdrop explains the fa thinkers\u2019 unwavering\ncommitment to safeguarding the ruler\u2019s authority. Their most\nsignificant theoretical innovation with this regard is the concept of\npositional power (shi \u52e2), which is frequently\nassociated with Shen Dao, but which matures in Han Feizi\n(Pines 2020a). The ruler\u2019s authority does not derive from his\npersonal qualities. What matters is the power of his position, which\nallows him to command obedience of his subjects. It is essential\ntherefore that the ruler firmly preserves the right of the final\ndecision in his hands and never relegates it to the underlings. Shen\nBuhai explains: \u201cHe who is a singular decision-maker can become\nthe sovereign of All under Heaven\u201d (Creel 1974: 380, translation\nmodified). Han Fei warns repeatedly that relegation of one of two\nmajor levers of rule\u2014rewards and punishments\u2014to the\nministers will open the way to ministerial usurpation. And the chapter\n\u201cRelying on law\u201d of Guanzi further\nelaborates:\n\n\nHence there are six things that the clear-sighted monarch maintains:\nto give life, to kill, to enrich, to impoverish, to ennoble, to\ndepreciate. These are the six levers that the ruler maintains.\n(Guanzi 45; cf. Rickett 1998: 148)\n\n\nThis devotedness to the ruler\u2019s power, coupled with the strongly\npronounced anti-ministerial stance, distinguishes the fa\nthinkers from their rivals. Sometimes, this devotedness appears truly\nextreme, as in the above chapter of Guanzi which urges the\nruler to punish by death any unauthorized action of a minister, even\nif its results were successful, while pardoning failures in cases\nwhere the minister strictly obeyed the ruler\u2019s command\n(Guanzi 45; Rickett 1998: 150). Such recommendations create\nan impression of the fa tradition as supportive of\nauthoritarian, even despotic rule. But one should understand the\nunderlying logic. Think of an army, where preservation of the chain of\ncommand and of the singular authority of every commander over his unit\nis far more important than ensuring the best possible commander at the\ntop. A subordinate officer may very well surpass his commander\nintellectually, but for the sake of military discipline, which is\nvital for preserving the army as such, it is important that he obey\ncommands. In a Warring State, where the difference between civilian\nand military realms was blurred, the need for unified decision-making\nwas unanimously accepted (for applying the military simile to the\npolitical realm, see, e.g., L\u00fcshi chunqiu 17.8\n[\u201cZhi yi\u201d \u57f7\u4e00]). The fa thinkers\nwere not exceptional with this regard, but simply more straightforward\nin advocating the absoluteness of the ruler\u2019s power.\n",
