    "main_text": "Other Topics || Boundary Perception\n4. Excerpts from the Literature\n\nThe entry concludes with a sample of significant passages from the\nphilosophical literature, listed in approximate chronological order.\nSome come from texts cited explicitly in the foregoing sections; the\nothers provide further indicative evidence of the many dimensions\nalong which the boundary concept has been analyzed and subjected to\nphilosophical inquiry throughout history.\n\nZhuangzi, Essentials for Nurturing Life, 2 (1994:\n26\u201327)\n The cook put down his cleaver and responded. [\u2026] In accord\nwith the natural grain, I slice at the great crevices, lead the blade\nthrough the great cavities. Following its inherent structure, I never\nencounter the slightest obstacle even where the veins and arteries\ncome together or where the ligaments and tendons join, much less from\nobvious big bones. A good cook changes his cleaver once a year because\nhe chops. An ordinary cook changes his cleaver once a month because he\nhacks. Now I\u2019ve been using my cleaver for nineteen years and\nhave cut up thousands of oxen with it, but the blade is still as fresh\nas though it had just come from the grindstone.\n\n\nPlato, Phaedrus, 265e (1997: 542)\n [The goal of the method of division] is to be able to cut up each\nkind according to its species along its natural joints, and to try not\nto splinter any part, as a bad butcher might do.\n\n\nPlato, Parmenides, 156c\u2013d (1997: 388)\n [A thing] won\u2019t be able to undergo being previously at rest\nand later in motion or being previously in motion and later at rest\nwithout changing. [\u2026] Yet there is no time in which something\ncan, simultaneously, be neither in motion nor at rest. [\u2026] Yet\nsurely it also doesn\u2019t change without changing. [\u2026] Is\nthere, then, this queer thing in which it might be, just when it\nchanges? \u2014 What queer thing? \u2014 The instant. The instant\nseems to signify something such that changing occurs from it to each\nof two states. For a thing doesn\u2019t change from rest while rest\ncontinues, or from motion while motion continues. Rather, this queer\ncreature, the instant, lurks between motion and rest.\n\n\nAristotle, Physics, VI, 234a24\u2013b9 (1984:\n395\u2013396)\n [N]othing can be in motion in a now. [\u2026] Nor can anything\nbe at rest. [\u2026] Inasmuch as it is the same now that belongs to\nboth the times [past and future], and it is possible for a thing to be\nin motion throughout one time and to be at rest throughout the other,\nand that which is in motion or at rest for the whole of a time will be\nin motion or at rest in any part of it in which it is of such a nature\nas to be in motion or at rest: it [would] follow that the same thing\ncan at the same time be at rest and in motion; for both the times have\nthe same extremity, viz. the now. [\u2026] It follows then that the\nmotion of that which is in motion and the rest of that which is at\nrest must occupy time.\n\n\nAristotle, Metaphysics, V, 1022a4\u20135 (1984:\n1613).\n We call a limit the last point of each thing, i.e., the first\npoint beyond which it is not possible to find any part, and the first\npoint within which every part is. [Note: This standard translation\ndiffers from the one given in Section 1 above, which did not use the\nword \u2018point\u2019. The Greek text only says \u2018the\nlast\u2019 and \u2018the first\u2019, without accompanying sortals,\nso a generic word such as \u2018thing\u2019 seemed more appropriate\nin the present context than \u2018point\u2019.] \n\n\nAristotle, Metaphysics, XI, 1060b12\u201317 (1984:\n1675\u20131676)\n If we are to suppose lines or what comes after these (I mean the\nprimary surfaces) to be principles, these at least are not separable\nsubstances, but sections and divisions \u2014 the former of surfaces,\nthe latter of bodies (while points are sections and divisions of\nlines); and further they are limits of these same things; and all\nthese are in other things and none is separable. \n\n\nEuclid, Elements, I, defs. 1\u20133, 5\u20136, 13\n(1926: 153)\n A point is that which has no part. A line is breadthless length.\nThe extremities of a line are points. [\u2026] A surface is that\nwhich has length and breadth only. The extremities of a surface are\nlines. [\u2026] A boundary is that which is an extremity of\nanything.\n\n\nOvid, Fasti, II, 657\u2013660 (2000: 47)\n The simple neighborhood meets and celebrates the feast, and\nchants your praises, holy Terminus: You confine peoples and cities and\ngreat kingdoms; all land would be disputed without you. You seek\nnone\u2019s favour, you are bribed by no gold; you guard entrusted\nlands with pledge of law. \n\n\nPlutarch, Numa, XVI, 1\u20132 (1914: 363)\n Terminus signifies boundary, and to this god they make\npublic and private sacrifices where their fields are set off by\nboundaries; of living victims nowadays, but anciently the sacrifice\nwas a bloodless one, since Numa reasoned that the god of boundaries\nwas a guardian of peace and a witness of just dealing, and should\ntherefore be clear of slaughter. [\u2026] He knew that a boundary,\nif observed, fetters lawless power; and if not observed, convicts of\ninjustice. \n\n\nAulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, VI.xiii.5\u20136 (1795:\n2/32)\n It was asked, When a dying man could be said to die; at the time\nhe actually expired, or when he was on the point of expiring? When a\nperson rising could be said to rise; when he actually stood, or when\nhe was but just sitting? He who learned any art, at what time he\nbecame an artist; when he was really one, or when he was just not one?\nIf you assert any one of these, you assert what is absurd and\nridiculous; yet it will appear more absurd, if you assert both or\nallow neither. \n\n\nSextus Empiricus, Against the Physicists, I, 269 (2012:\n52\u201353)\n Socrates dies either while being or while not being. [\u2026]\nWell, when he is and is alive, he does not die; after all, he is\nalive; but again, he does not die having died, since then he will be\ndying twice, which is absurd. So Socrates does not die. \n\n\nSextus Empiricus, Against the Physicists, I,\n260\u2013264 (2012: 51\u201352)\n [A] whole does not reasonably touch a whole; for if a whole\ntouches a whole, it will not be touching but a unification of them\nboth, and the two bodies will be one body. [\u2026] Then again, it\nis not possible for a part to touch a part. For the part is conceived\nas a part in virtue of its state in relation to the whole, but in\nterms of its own limits it is a whole. [\u2026] Then again, nor does\na whole touch a part. For if the whole is going to touch the part, the\nwhole, being shrunk down together with the part, will be a part, and\nthe part, being stretched out alongside the whole, will be a whole.\n[\u2026] And the same argument applies to the converse. [\u2026]\nHence if neither the whole touches the whole, nor the part the part,\nnor the whole the part, nor the reverse, nothing touches anything.\n\n\n\nJohn of Damascus, The Fount of Knowledge, I, 8 (1958:\n27)\n Definition is the term for the setting of land boundaries taken\nin a metaphorical sense. For, just as the boundary separates that\nwhich belongs to one from that which belongs to another, so does the\ndefinition set off the nature of one thing from that of any other.\n\n\n\nBoethius, Second Commentary on Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge\nI, xi, 14\u201321 (1994: 23\u201324)\n A line is something in a body. And what it is it owes to the\nbody. That is, it keeps its being through the body. This is explained\nas follows. If it is separated from the body, it does not subsist. Who\nby any sense faculty ever grasped a line separated from a body? \n\n\nPeter Abelard, Glosses on Porphyry, 8.1\u20134 (1994:\n26)\n There are two species of incorporeals. Some of them, such as God\nand the soul, can endure in their incorporeality outside sensibles.\nBut others, such as a line without subject body, are entirely unable\nto be outside the sensibles they are in. \n\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna), The Book of the Healing\n\u2013 Metaphysics, II, ii, 4\u20136 (2005: 50)\n [T]he body is the substance for which it is possible for you to\nbegin by postulating in it a dimension in whatever manner you desire.\n[\u2026] It is due to the body\u2019s having this description that\none refers to body as being long, wide, and deep, just as it is said\nthat body is that which is divisible in [terms] of all dimensions.\n\n\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna), The Book of the Healing\n\u2013 Physics, III, ii, 8\u201310 (2009: 269\u2013271)\n Continuous is an equivocal term that is said in three\nsenses [\u2026] One [\u2026] is said of the magnitude that it is\ncontinuous with another when its limit and that of the other are one.\n[\u2026] The second [\u2026] is said of that which, when one side\nof the continuous thing is moved in a direction away from the other,\nthe other follows it. [\u2026] Something is said to be continuous in\nitself when it is such that you can posit parts for it between which\nthere is the continuity that is in the first sense. \n\n\nIbn Ru\u0161d (Averroes), On Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, I, 7 (2010: 36)\n [In the language of] the masses, \u2018one\u2019 generally\nsignifies such things only inasmuch as they are isolated from other\nthings and set apart by their essence [\u2026] Some of these things\nare isolated by the places which encompass them (this is the commonest\nmeaning of being-isolated), others are isolated by their limits only\n(this [applies to] the contiguous), again others are those which are\nisolated only by imagination (this is how number is attached to what\nis continuous). \n\n\nJohn Duns Scotus, Ordinatio, II, d. 2/2, q. 5, ad 2\n(1973: 323\u2013324; Eng. trans. by Peter L. P. Simpson)\n If a point is only a privation, line too will be only a\nprivation, as well as surface and solid; for a termed thing is defined\nby what terminates it and something positive does not essentially\ninclude a privation. [\u2026] And from this further is inferred\nsomething unacceptable, that if a surface is only the privation of\ndepth, how will a point be the privation of a privation? [\u2026] In\naddition, there are on a surface many corporeal or sensible qualities,\nas it seems. Therefore a surface is not merely a privation. \n\n\nWilliam of Ockham, Quodlibetal Questions, I, q. 9, ad 2\n(1991: 53)\n [T]he spherical body does not touch the flat body primarily with\na part that is such that each of its parts touches the flat\nbody. Therefore, it does not touch it primarily with some part that is\nprior to all the other touching parts. Rather, any given touching part\nis still such that a half of it does not touch immediately, and a half\nof that half does not touch immediately, and so on ad infinitum. \n\n\nLeonardo da Vinci, Notebooks (1938: 76)\n What is it [\u2026] that divides the atmosphere from the water?\nIt is necessary that there should be a common boundary which is\nneither air nor water but is without substance, because a body\ninterposed between two bodies prevents their contact, and this does\nnot happen in water with air. [\u2026] Therefore a surface is the\ncommon boundary of two bodies which are not continuous, and does not\nform part of either one or the other, for if the surface formed part\nof it, it would have divisible bulk, whereas, however, it is not\ndivisible and nothingness divides these bodies the one from the other.\n\n\n\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, al-Asf\u0101r\nal-Arba\u2018a, IV, 274 (Eng. trans. from Rezaei and Bozorgi\n2001: 34)\n If there is no common boundary between water and air which is the\nwarmest instance of water and the coldest of air, it will require that\nin an instance, that is when water transforms into air, hyle\nstays formless, which is impossible. \n\n\nMichelangelo Buonarroti, Sonnet 151, 1\u20134 (1996:\n195)\n The greatest artist does not have any concept which a single\npiece of marble does not itself contain within its excess, though only\na hand that obeys the intellect can discover it. \n\n\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez, Metaphysical Disputations 40, V,\n\u00a741 (1861: 562\u2013563; Eng. trans. by Robert Pasnau)\n [I]t could plausibly be said that a line can be conserved by God\nwithout a limiting point, and a surface without a line, and a body\nwithout a surface. \n\n\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez, Metaphysical Disputations 40, V,\n\u00a758 (1861: 567; Eng. trans. by Robert Pasnau)\n Suppose that, in the continuous surface of a wall, one half is\nmaximally white and the other half is maximally black, and those\nqualities each have their own indivisible boundaries\n[termini] by which they are contained and limited. It will\nthen be necessary that, from that part in virtue of which they are\ncontiguous, they each have their own boundaries inhering at the same\ntime in the same line connecting the quantitative surface. [\u2026]\nFrom this it further happens that in the same indivisible boundary of\nmatter there would be, at the same, time two specific substantial\nforms with respect to something that is indivisible in extension.\n\n\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes, Principles of Philosophy, II.15\n(1985: 229)\n \u2018Surface\u2019 here does not mean any part of the\nsurrounding body but merely the boundary between the surrounding and\nsurrounded bodies, which is no more than a mode. Or rather what is\nmeant is simply the common surface, which is not a part of one body\nrather than the other but is always reckoned to be the same, provided\nit keeps the same size and shape. \n\n\nPierre Bayle, Historical and Critical Dictionary, art.\n\u2018Zeno\u2019, remark G.IV (1734\u20131738: 5/613)\n [S]ome scholastic Philosophers [\u2026] suppose, that nature\nhath intermixed Mathematical points with the parts divisible in\ninfinitum, to the end that they may serve to connect them, and\ncompose the extremities of bodies. They thought by that means to\nanswer also the objection of the penetrative contact of two surfaces:\nbut this evasion is so absurd, that it doth not deserve to be refuted.\n\n\n\nDavid Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, I, ii, 4 (1978:\n44)\n [I]f we have the idea of indivisible points, lines and surfaces\nconformable to the definition, their existence is certainly possible:\nbut if we have no such idea, \u2019tis impossible we can ever\nconceive the termination of any figure; without which conception there\ncan be no geometrical demonstration. \n\n\nMargaret Cavendish, Observations upon Experimental\nPhilosophy, I, xxxi (2001: 129)\n [T]he opinion of atoms, is fitter for a poetical fancy, than for\nserious philosophy [\u2026] there cannot be atoms in nature, or else\nnature would be like a beggar\u2019s coat full of lice: Neither would\nshe be able to rule those wandering and straggling atoms, because\n[\u2026] each is a single body by itself, having no dependence upon\neach other. Wherefore, if there should be a composition of atoms, it\nwould not be a body made of parts, but of so many whole and entire\nsingle bodies, meeting together as a swarm of bees. \n\n\nLeonhard Euler, Lettres \u00e0 une princesse\nd\u2019Allemagne, CII (1795: 453)\n As a general notion contains an infinite number of individual\nobjects, we may consider it as a space in which they are all\ncontained. Thus, for the notion of man we form a space\n[\u2026] in which we conceive all men to be comprehended. For the\nnotion of mortal we form another, [\u2026] in which we\nconceive every thing mortal to be comprehended. And when I affirm,\nall men are mortal, it is the same thing with affirming, that\nthe first figure is contained in the second. \n\n\nJohn Venn, \u2018On the Diagrammatic and Mechanical\nRepresentation of Propositions and Reasonings\u2019 (1880: 1)\n What we here represent is, of course, the extent or scope of each\nterm of the proposition. We draw two circles, and make them include or\nexclude or intersect one another, according as the classes denoted by\nthe terms happen to stand in relation to one another in this respect.\n\n\n\nJean Jacques Rousseau, Discourse on the Origin of\nInequality (1992: 44)\n The first person who, having enclosed a plot of land, took it\ninto his head to say this is mine and found people simple\nenough to believe him, was the true founder of civil society. What\ncrimes, wars, murders, what miseries and horrors would the human race\nhave been spared, had someone pulled up the stakes or filled the ditch\nand cried out to his fellow men: \u2018Do not listed to this\nimpostor\u2019. \n\n\nAlphonse de Lamartine, \u2018La Marseillaise de la paix\u2019\n(1841: 796)\n Do we see any trace of boundaries in the sky? Does its dome have\na wall, a marker, a center? Nations! A pompous word to say barbarity!\n\n\n\nImmanuel Kant, Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics,\n\u00a757 (1783: 94)\n In all bounds there is something positive (e.g., a surface is the\nboundary of corporeal space, and is therefore itself a space, a line\nis a space, which is the boundary of the surface, a point the boundary\nof the line, but yet always a place in space), whereas limits contain\nmere negations. \n\n\nGeorg Wilhelm F. Hegel, The Science of Logic, I, i,\n1.2.B.b (1833: 98\u201399)\n [I]n limit, something marks the boundary of its other. [\u2026]\nSomething, as an immediate existence, is therefore the limit with\nrespect to another something; but it has this limit in it and\nis something through the mediation of that limit, which is just as\nmuch its non-being. The limit is the mediation in virtue of which\nsomething and other each both is and is not. \n\n\nLoba\u010devskij, New Principles of Geometry\n(1835\u20131938: 21\u201322)\n Surfaces, lines, points, as geometry defines them, exist only in\nour imagination. [\u2026] We will attach ourselves only to ideas\nwhich in our mind unite themselves directly to the conception of\nbodies to which our imagination is habituated. \n\n\nBernard Bolzano Paradoxes of the Infinite, \u00a766\n(1851: 167\u2013168)\n I define the limit of a body as the aggregate of all the\nextreme [\u00e4usserst] ether-atoms which still\nbelong to it. [\u2026] A closer consideration further shows\nthat many bodies are at certain places altogether devoid of limiting\natoms; none of their atoms can be described as the extreme\nones among those which still belong to it and would accompany it if it\nstarted to move. [Two bodies are in contact] when the extreme atoms of\nthe one, [\u2026] together with certain atoms of the other, form a\ncontinuous extension. \n\n\nFranz Brentano, \u2018Nativistic, Empiricist, and Anoetistic\nTheories of our Presentation of Space\u2019 (1976: 146)\n One of the two lines into which the line would be split upon\ndivision would [\u2026] have an end point, but the other no\nbeginning point. This inference has been quite correctly drawn by\nBolzano, who was led thereby to his monstrous doctrine that there\nwould exist bodies with and without surfaces, the one class containing\njust so many as the other, because contact would be possible only\nbetween a body with a surface and another without. He ought, rather,\nto have had his attention drawn by such consequences to the fact that\nthe whole conception of the line and of other continua as sets of\npoints runs counter to the concept of contact and thereby abolishes\nprecisely what makes up the essence of the continuum. \n\n\nFranz Brentano, \u2018On What Is Continuous\u2019 (1976: 12 and\n41)\n Because a boundary, even when itself continuous, can never exist\nexcept as belonging to something continuous of more dimensions\n[\u2026], it is, considered for itself, nothing other than a\nuniversal, to which \u2014 as to other universals \u2014 more than\none thing can correspond. And the geometer\u2019s proposition that\nonly one straight line is conceivable between two points, is\nstrictly speaking false. [\u2026] If a red surface and a blue\nsurface are in contact with each other, then a red and a blue line\ncoincide. \n\n\nCharles S. Peirce, \u2018The Logic of Quantity\u2019 (1893:\n7.127)\n A drop of ink has fallen upon the paper and I have walled it\nround. Now every point of the area within the walls is either black or\nwhite; and no point is both black and white. That is plain. The black\nis, however, all in one spot or blot; it is within bounds. There is a\nline of demarcation between the black and the white. Now I ask about\nthe points of this line, are they black or white? Why one more than\nthe other? Are they (A) both black and white or (B) neither black nor\nwhite? Why A more than B, or B more than A? [\u2026] The logical\nconclusion [\u2026] is that the points of the boundary do not exist.\n\n\n\nAmbrose Bierce, \u2018The Devil\u2019s Dictionary\u2019 (1881:\n323)\n Boundary, n. In political geography, an imaginary line\nbetween two nations, separating the imaginary rights of one from the\nimaginary rights of the other. \n\n\nGottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic \u00a726\n(1884: 35)\n One calls the equator an imaginary line, but it would be wrong to\ncall it a line that has merely been thought up. It was not created by\nthought as the result of a psychological process, but is only\napprehended or grasped by thought. If its being apprehended were a\nmatter of its coming into being, then we could not say anything\npositive about the equator for any time prior to this supposed coming\ninto being. \n\n\nGottlob Frege, The Fundamental Laws of Arithmetic, Vol.\nII, \u00a756 (1903: 159)\n A definition of a concept (of a possible predicate) must\n[\u2026] unambiguously determine, as regards any object, whether or\nnot it falls under the concept. [\u2026] We may express this\nmetaphorically as follows: the concept must have a sharp boundary. To\na concept without sharp boundary there would correspond an area that\nhad not a sharp boundary-line all around, but in places just vaguely\nfaded away into the background. [\u2026] The law of the excluded\nmiddle is really just another form of the requirement that the concept\nshould have a sharp boundary. \n\n\nGeorge Nathaniel Curzon, Frontiers (1907: 13 and 54)\n I have accepted the broad distinction between Natural and\nArtificial Frontiers, both as generally recognized, and as\nscientifically the most exact. [\u2026] There is also a class of\nso-called Natural Frontiers which I have been obliged to omit, as\npossessing no valid claim to the title, namely those which are claimed\nby nations as natural on grounds of ambition, or expediency, or more\noften sentiment. The attempt to realize Frontiers of this type has\nbeen responsible for many of the wars, and some of the most tragic\nvicissitudes in history. .\n\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois, The Souls of Black Folk (1903: vi, 13,\n40); also in \u2018The Color Line Belts the World\u2019 (1906:\n30)\n The problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the\ncolor-line. \n\n\nLucien Febvre, La Terre et l\u2019\u00e9volution\nhumaine (1922: 297)\n For the whole problem is, or appears to us to be, a question of\nboundaries. Within us, so deeply implanted that we no longer notice\nits hold on us, there is a certain idea of the \u2018natural\nlimits\u2019 of the great States which causes us to think of their\nboundaries as things in themselves, having an actual value, a kind of\nmechanical virtue, and a compulsory and at the same time creative\npower. [\u2026] A whole philosophy of history [is] comprised in that\nword \u2018natural\u2019. \n\n\nWilliam James, Pragmatism (1907: 247)\n Hence, even in the field of sensation, our minds exert a certain\narbitrary choice. By our inclusions and omissions we trace the\nfield\u2019s extent; by our emphasis we mark its foreground and its\nbackground; by our order we read it in this direction or in that. We\nreceive in short the block of marble, but we carve the statue\nourselves. \n\n\nErnst Cassirer, Philosophie der symbolischen Formen\n(1923: 280)\n The beginning of thought and speech is not this: we do not simply\nseize on and name certain distinctions that are somewhere present in\nfeeling or intuition; on the contrary, on our own initiative we draw\ncertain dividing lines, effect certain separations and connections, by\nvirtue of which distinct individual configurations emerge from the\nuniform flux of consciousness. \n\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,\n5.6\n The limits [Grenzen] of my language mean the limits of\nmy world. \n\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, I,\n\u00a799 (1953: 45e)\n An indefinite boundary is not really a boundary at all. Here one\nthinks perhaps: if I say \u2018I have locked the man up fast in the\nroom \u2014 there is only one door left open\u2019 \u2014 then I\nsimply haven\u2019t locked him in at all; his being locked in is a\nsham. \n\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, Remarks on the Philosophy of\nPsychology, II, \u00a7626 (1980: 108e)\n It is unnatural to draw a conceptual boundary line where there is\nnot some special justification for it, where similarities would\nconstantly draw us across the arbitrarily drawn line. \n\n\nAlfred N. Whitehead, An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of\nNatural Knowledge (1919: 5)\n An investigation into the foundations of geometry has to explain\nspace as a complex of relations between things. It has to describe\nwhat a point is, and has to show how the geometric relations between\npoints issue from the ultimate relations between the ultimate things\nwhich are the immediate objects of knowledge. Thus the starting point\nof a discussion on the foundations of geometry is a discussion of the\ncharacter of the immediate data of perception. It is not now open to\nmathematicians to assume sub silentio that points are among\nthese data. \n\n\nWilliam Ernest Johnson, Logic, Part III: The Logical\nFoundations of Science (1924: 163\u2013164)\n We are thus led to distinguish between the parts of a whole, and\nthe boundaries between these parts. The parts of a line are lines, the\nparts of an area are areas, the parts of a region are regions; but the\nboundary between contiguous parts of a line is a point, and the\nboundary between contiguous parts of an area is a line, and the\nboundary between contiguous parts of a region is an area or surface.\nThe parts of a whole, therefore, are homogeneous with one another and\nwith the whole; but [\u2026] the boundaries between two contiguous\nparts are always of one lower order of dimensions than the parts.\n\n\n\nSusan Stebbing, A Modern Introduction to Logic (1930: 452\nand 451)\n [The] success of physics in dealing with the sensible world is\ninexplicable unless such expressions as \u2018point\u2019,\n\u2018line\u2019, \u2018moment\u2019, \u2018instantaneous\nspace\u2019, \u2018momentary configurations\u2019 can be\nexpressed in terms of what is sensible. [\u2026] It does not matter\nthat a point should prove to be a complicated structure provided that\nits logical relations are simple and have the necessary\nformal properties. [\u2026] All that matters in deduction are the\npurely formal, or logical, properties of the terms that enter into the\ndeduction; the nature of the term itself has no relevance.\n\n\n\nRobert Musil, The Man Without Qualities (1930: 22)\n Ultimately a thing exists only by virtue of its boundaries, which\nmeans by a more or less hostile act against its surroundings: without\nthe Pope there would have been no Luther, and without the pagans no\nPope. \n\n\nH. H. Price, Perception (1932: 106)\n A surface must be the surface of something; and not merely that,\nit must be the surface of some material thing. Indeed, there is really\nno such entity as a surface; there are only solid things thus\nand thus surfaced. \u2018Surface,\u2019 it is true, is a\nsubstantive in grammar; but it is not the name of a particular\nexistent, but of an attribute. \n\n\nPercy Stanley Fritz, Colorado, the Centennial State\n(1941: 3)\n The State of Colorado is primarily a mental concept. It is an\narbitrary political designation made for convenience sake. There are\nno natural boundaries whatsoever. If, when you leave the State of\nColorado in your automobile, you should miss seeing the sign by the\nroadside which says \u2018Colorado\u2013Kansas\u2019, you would\nnever know that you had passed from one State to the other. [\u2026]\nIf a windstorm happened to carry away the state boundary sign, it\nwould require a surveyor with precision instruments to tell where the\nboundary was. The State of Colorado is simply a convenient legal\nfiction. \n\n\nJan O. M. Broek, \u2018The Problem of Natural Frontiers\u2019\n(1941: 8)\n One of the most powerful arguments to make a frontier seem just\nis to stamp it as a natural frontier.\n\n\nStephen Jones, Boundary-Making (1945: 3)\n The goodness or badness of a boundary depends as much upon the\ngeneral situation as upon the details of delimitation and demarcation.\nA boundary, like the human skin, may have diseases of its own or may\nreflect the illnesses of the body. \n\n\nMartin Heidegger, \u2018Building Dwelling Thinking\u2019 (1952:\n154)\n A boundary is not that at which something stops but, as the\nGreeks recognized, the boundary is that from which something\nbegins its presencing. \n\n\nJohn L. Austin, Sense and Sensibilia (1962: 100)\n It is [\u2026] wrong to imply that everything has a surface.\nWhere and what exactly is the surface of a cat? \n\n\nJ. J. Gibson, The Ecological Approach to Visual\nPerception (1979: 23)\n The surface is where most of the action is. The surface is where\nlight is reflected or absorbed, not the interior of the substance. The\nsurface is what touches the animal, not the interior. The surface is\nwhere chemical reactions mostly take place. The surface is where\nvaporization or diffusion of substances into the medium occurs. And\nthe surface is where vibrations of the substance are transmitted into\nthe medium. \n\n\nGeorge Spencer-Brown, Laws of Form (1969: 1)\n Distinction is perfect continence. That is to say, a distinction\nis drawn by arranging a boundary with separate sides so that a point\non one side cannot reach the other side without crossing a boundary.\nFor example, in a plane space a circle draws a distinction. \n\n\nMichael Dummett, Frege. Philosophy of Language (1973:\n577) \n The picture of reality as an amorphous lump, not yet articulated\ninto discrete objects, thus proves to be a correct one, so long as we\nmake the right use of it.\n\n\nNelson Goodman, \u2018Notes on the Well-Made World\u2019 (1983:\n104)\n Now as we thus make constellations by picking out and putting\ntogether certain stars rather than others, so we make stars by drawing\ncertain boundaries rather than others. Nothing dictates whether the\nskies shall be marked off into constellations or other objects. We\nhave to make what we find, be it the Great Dipper, Sirius, food, fuel,\nor a stereo system. \n\n\nAlan Sidelle, \u2018Rigidity, Ontology, and Semantic\nStructure\u2019 (1992: 172)\n The world is capable of being cut up in so many ways, and\nwhenever we consider such a cut (some principle of individuation), we\nare considering the world cut that way, i.e., so articulated. An\narticulation will specify both actual conditions which must be met for\nsomething to be (an) F, and identity conditions for tracing Fs through\nspace, time, and possible worlds. If there are portions of the world\nwhich meet the actual conditions, then there are Fs. \n\n\nRoderick Chisholm, \u2018Boundaries as Dependent\nParticulars\u2019 (1984: 88)\n If the continuous object is cut in half, then does the one\nboundary [that demarcates two adjacent parts] become two boundaries,\none thing thus becoming two things? [\u2026] But how can one thing\n\u2014 even if it is only a boundary \u2014 become two things? And\ndoes this mean that when two things become continuous, then two things\nthat had been diverse become identical with each other, two\nthings thus becoming one thing? \n\n\nDavid K. Lewis, The Plurality of Worlds (1986: 212)\n The reason why it\u2019s vague where the outback begins is not\nthat there\u2019s this thing, the outback, with imprecise borders;\nrather there are many things, with different borders, and nobody has\nbeen fool enough to try to enforce a choice of one of them as the\nofficial referent of the word \u2018outback\u2019. \n\n\nMichael Tye, \u2018Vague Objects\u2019 (1990: 535)\n There is no line which sharply divides the matter composing\n[Mount] Everest from the matter outside it. Everest\u2019s boundaries\nare fuzzy. Some molecules are inside Everest and some molecules\noutside. But some have an indefinite status: there is no objective,\ndeterminate fact of the matter about whether they are inside or\noutside. \n\n\nMark Sainsbury, \u2018Concepts without Boundaries\u2019 (1990:\n257)\n A vague concept is boundaryless in that no boundary marks the\nthings which fall under it from the things which do not, and no\nboundary marks the things which definitely fall under it from the\nthings which do not definitely do so; and so on. Manifestations are\nthe unwillingness of knowing subjects to draw any such boundaries, the\ncognitive impossibility of identifying such boundaries, and the\nneedlessness and even disutility of such boundaries. \n\n\nPeter Simons, \u2018Faces, Boundaries, and Thin Layers\u2019\n(1991: 91)\n If a macroscopic body consists of spatially separate particles\n[\u2026] a connected boundary would need to bridge the gaps between\nthe [particles] and thus would be both am \u2018imaginary\u2019\nrather than real entity (like saying a fakir bed of nails has a flat\ntop) and to some extent arbitrary (like the curves scientists draw\nthrough the scattered and inexact data to give a smooth graph). \n\n\nEviatar Zerubavel, The Fine Line (1991: 5)\n We transform the natural world into a social one by carving out\nof it mental chunks we then treat as if they were discrete, totally\ndetached from their surroundings. The way we mark off islands of\nproperty is but one example of the general process by which we create\nmeaningful social entities. \n\n\nCatherine Elgin, \u2018Unnatural Science\u2019 (1995: 297)\n Our parochial concerns pretty clearly influence our choice of\ncategories for macroscopic objects and kinds. [\u2026] It would be\nrather remarkable if, for example, a taxonomy that draws the\ndistinction between horses and zebras where we do aligned at all well\nwith natural categories suitable for describing the cosmos as a whole,\nbut indifferent to human faculties and ends. \n\n\nBarry Smith, \u2018On Drawing Lines on a Map\u2019 (1995:\n479)\n The interiors of fiat objects are [\u2026] autonomous portions\nof autonomous reality. Only the respective external boundaries are\ncreated by us; it is these which are the products of our mental and\nlinguistic activity, and of associated conventional laws, norms and\nhabits. \n\n\nBarry Smith, \u2018On Substances, Accidents and Universals\u2019\n(1997b: 122)\n Delineation is, be it noted, an immensely powerful faculty of\ncognition; the scope of delineatory intentionality, the effortlessness\nwith which we can comprehend highly complex wholes \u2014 which may\nbe scattered throughout the length and breadth of the universe, in\nboth space and time \u2014 with a simple delineatory act (\u2018the\nlegacy of the Renaissance\u2019, \u2018the Austro-Hungarian Empire\nand its successor states\u2019, \u2018English poetry\u2019) is\nwondrous to behold, and bears comparison with the magic of\nsingle-rayed intentionality, whereby, on the basis of a list of\nentries which might be drawn up entirely at random, we can be\ndirected, in succession, to mountains in Siberia, teapots in Halifax,\nand black holes in the galaxy of Mog. \n\n\nRaviel Netz, 2009, Barbed Wire (2009: xi)\n Define, on the two-dimensional surface of the earth, lines across\nwhich motion is to be prevented, and you have one of the key themes of\nhistory. With a closed line (i.e., a curve enclosing a figure), and\nthe prevention of motion from outside the line to its inside, you\nderive the idea of property. With the same line, and the prevention of\nmotion from inside to outside, you derive the idea of prison. With an\nopen line (i.e., a curve that does not enclose a figure), and the\nprevention of motion in either direction, you derive the idea of\nborder. Properties, prisons, borders: it is through the prevention of\nmotion that space enters history. \n\n\nGloria E. Anzald\u00faa, Borderlands/La Frontera (1987:\n3)\n Borders are set up to define the places that are safe and unsafe,\nto distinguish us from them. A border is a dividing\nline, a narrow strip along a steep edge. A borderland is a vague and\nundetermined place created by the emotional residue of an unnatural\nboundary. It is in a constant state of transition. The prohibited and\nforbidden are its inhabitants. Los atravesados live here: the\nsquint-eyed, the perverse, the queer, the troublesome, the mongrel,\nthe mulato, the half-breed, the half dead; in short, those who cross\nover, pass over, or go through the confines of the\n\u2018normal\u2019. \n\n\nSally Haslanger, \u2018Feminism in Metaphysics: Negotiating the\nNatural\u2019 (2000: 116; 2012: 148\u2013149)\n [T]here is an unmistakable pattern of projecting onto women and\npeople of color, as their \u2018nature\u2019 or as\n\u2018natural\u2019, features that are instead (if manifested at\nall) a product of social forces. This projective error has led\nfeminists to be extremely suspicious of natural kinds and objective\ntypes: if one function of references to \u2018nature\u2019 or\n\u2018natures\u2019 is to mark the boundaries of what is socially\npossible, thereby \u2018justifying\u2019 pernicious institutions, we\nmust be wary of the suggestion that any category is\n\u2018natural\u2019. [\u2026] Is there any meaningful (and\npolitically viable) distinction between the natural and the social,\nand if so, where does the line fall? Is there any way to theorize\nabout what\u2019s natural that does not depend on the projection of\nour political biases? If so, how? \n\n\nSarah Green, \u2018A Sense of Border\u2019 (2012: 580)\n While it is clear that borders do not independently exist as\nself-evident entities in the landscape [\u2026] it is also the case\nthat once constructed (which includes all the various associated\nbordering practices, both formal and informal), borders can take on\nthing-like qualities, both in practice and in people\u2019s\nimaginations. \n\n\nJody Azzouni, Ontology without Borders (2017: 143)\n [T]here are no worldly ontological borders between purported\nobjects; there are no properties, no relations \u2014 no aspects of\nanything in the world \u2014 that constitute or amount to\nworldly individuation conditions for objects [\u2026] we project\nobject boundaries onto the world. \n\n",
