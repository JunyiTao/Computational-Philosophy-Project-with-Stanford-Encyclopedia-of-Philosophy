    "main_text": "Arguments for Moral Skepticism || Moral Explanations\n3.2 Moral Explanations\n\n\nAnother way to argue for moral skepticism is to cite a requirement on\njustified belief. On one view, we cannot be justified in believing any\nclaim unless the truth of that claim is necessary for the best\nexplanation of some independent fact. Some philosophers then argue\nthat moral truths are never necessary for the best explanation of any\nnon-moral fact (cf. Harman 1977). It follows that we cannot be\njustified in believing any moral claim (cf. Hill 2016).\n\n\nThis argument can be countered in two ways. First, one could deny\nthat justified belief must always involve inference to the best\nexplanation. It is not clear, for example, that beliefs about\nmathematics or colors are or must be grounded in this way, although\nsuch beliefs still seem justified. (Compare Harman 1977 on\nmathematics and color.)\n\n\nAnother common response is that sometimes a moral truth is necessary\nfor the best explanation of a non-moral fact (cf. Sturgeon 1985).\nHitler\u2019s vices are sometimes cited to explain his atrocities.\nSlavery\u2019s injustice has been said to explain its demise. And the\nfact that everyone agrees that it is morally wrong to torture babies\njust to get sexual pleasure might be best explained by the fact that\nthis common belief is true.\n\n\nMoral skeptics usually reply that such explanations can be replaced\nby non-moral descriptions of Hitler, slavery, and torture. If such\nreplacements are always available, then moral truths are not\nnecessary for the best explanation of anything. However, it is not\nclear whether or not non-moral explanations really do work as well as\nmoral explanations in all cases. Nor is it clear whether inference to\nthe best explanation must lie behind all justified belief.\n\nA special case of this argument, called an evolutionary debunking\nargument, has led to vigorous debate recently (cf. Kahane 2011, May 2018). \nSome moral skeptics (or\nat least skeptics about moral realism) argue that moral beliefs can be\nexplained by evolutionary biology perhaps with help from psychology,\nsociology, or culture without appeal to any moral fact or truth. Such\ntruth-independent explanations are then supposed to show that moral\nbeliefs are either not true, not really (mind independently) true, or\nnot justified (cf. Joyce 2006, Street 2006, Braddock 2017). As\nwith other arguments from the explanatory impotence of moral facts,\ncritics can reply either by arguing that moral facts do some\nexplanatory work (e.g. Copp 2008 with reply by Street 2008) or by\narguing that moral beliefs can be justified even if moral facts do not\ndo any explanatory work (cf. Bergmann & Kain 2014).\n",
