    "main_text": "CA and Philosophy || CA and Emergence\n3.1 CA and Emergence \n\nCA can be considered a paradigmatic locus for the study of phenomena\nrelated to emergence (for an introduction, see the entry on\n emergent properties).\n One can initially divide the problem of emergence into two separate\nquestions, roughly corresponding to epistemological and ontological\nissues: How can we recognize emergence? What is the\nontological status of the high-level properties and features?\nAs a matter of historical fact, CA have been invoked mainly to address\nthe former, but we will see in\n Section 3.4\n below that there is work for CA also on the ontological side.\n\nEpistemological issues have often been raised in connection with\ncomplex systems in general. In their open agenda for complex social\nsystems, Miller and Page include the following question: \u201cIs\nthere an objective basis for recognizing emergence and\ncomplexity?\u201d (Miller & Page 2007: 233\u2013234). The\nliterature on CA has variously addressed the issue. On the one hand,\nbeing a low-level simple and controllable environment, CA present\nthemselves as a natural framework for tackling the problem in its\npurest form. On the other hand, CA researchers have recognized how the\nsystemic and global features of a complex CA system can be hard to\npredict even with perfect knowledge of low-level entities and laws:\n\n\n\nOver and over again we will see the same kind of thing: that even\nthough the underlying rules for a system are simple, and even though\nthe system is started from simple initial conditions, the behavior\nthat the system shows can nevertheless be highly complex. (Wolfram\n2002: 28)\n\nDue to the local nature of a CA\u2019s operations, it is typically\nvery hard, if not impossible, to understand the CA\u2019s global\nbehavior (\u2026) by directly examining either the bits in the\nlookup table or the temporal sequence of raw 1\u20130 spatial\nconfigurations of the lattice. (Hordijk, Crutchfield, & Mitchell\n1996: 2)\n\n\nNow the issue of detecting emergence is connected to the conceptual\nproblems of defining what an emerging feature is: we need\nsome idea of what we are looking for in order to scan the\nspace-time evolution of a system and recognize its patterns. We may\nstart with the fourfold characterization of emergence provided in\nClark 2013. Emergence may be taken: \n\n(E1)\nAs collective self-organisation.\n(E2)\nAs unprogrammed functionality.\n(E3)\nAs interactive complexity.\n(E4)\nAs incompressible unfolding.\n\n\nIn the first sense, an emergent feature is \u201cany interesting\nbehaviour that arises as a direct result of multiple self-organizing\n\u2026 interactions occurring in a system of simple elements\u201d\n(Clark 2013: 132). CA clearly fit the\n E1\n bill, but that is because this is a rather generic characterization\n(What counts as interesting? What is self-organization?). Things get a\nbit more precise with\n E2:\n emergent features here are taken as unprogrammed, that is,\nas such that there is no program explicitly encoding the relevant\nphenomena, features, or processes in the target system (a typical\nexample is cricket phonotaxis, see Clark 2013: 120: female crickets\nmove towards males via a mechanical body system directing them to the\nsource of sounds of particular wavelengths; one can describe this as\nfemales aiming towards males after hearing their sound, but what is\nencoded in the cricket\u2019s body functions is just an automatic\nearlier activation of the side of the body first reached by the\nsounds). According to the concept embodied in\n E3,\n we get emergence as interactive complexity when \u201ccomplex,\ncyclic interactions give rise to stable and salient patterns of\nsystemic behavior\u201d (Clark 2013: 134); in particular, the\ninteractions are supposed to be nonlinear (a typical example are\nconvection rolls in a fluid heated in a pan: see Kelso 1995: 5). \n\nNow the emergent properties attracting CA scholars\u2019 attention,\nunsurprisingly, have mainly been computational properties, i.e., the\nfeatures enabling a system to perform complex calculations in spite of\nnot being explicitly computationally encoded at the base level (which\nsits in the vicinity of\n E2).\n Additionally, as we have seen during our discussion of the Edge of\nChaos hypothesis, CA scholars have focused on the study of nonlinear\nglobal dynamics emerging from the local interactions of the CA cells\n(which sits in the vicinity of\n E3).\n In order to introduce the formal work on emergent CA computation, and\nto compare these findings with the available philosophical accounts,\nwe can start again with a concrete example. This is the\n\u201cclassification problem\u201d. \n\nWe want to design a one-dimensional automaton that answers a simple\nquestion: Are there more white or black cells at a given time \\(t_0\\)?\nStarting from any initial conditions with more white (black) cells,\nthe ideal automaton will halt having all its cells turned white\n(black) after a given number of time steps (designing an automaton\nthat always gives the right answer is not feasible in practice; so the\nperformance is judged by the fraction of random initial conditions\nthat are correctly classified). \n\n\n\n\n\\(t_0\\)\n\n\n\\(\\longrightarrow\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_n\\)\n\n\n\nThe task is far from trivial in a CA, involving the intricacy of the\nemergence in both\n E2\n and\n E3\n sense. The answer requires a global perspective (how many cells are\nwhite (black) in the lattice as a whole?). However, the cells work\nwith only local rules explicitly encoded in them: no single cell can\ndo the counting. The ideal automaton should find a way to aggregate\ninformation from several parts of its own lattice to give the final\nanswer. A kind of emergent computation is needed to successfully solve\nthis density classification task. It has been proved that no CA can\nsolve this problem precisely (see Land & Belew 1995). Since,\nhowever, CA with larger neighborhoods achieve better results in tasks\nof this kind, genetic algorithms are used to efficiently\nsearch the solution space (genetic algorithms are computational\nanalogues of genetic evolution, in which a computational problem is\naddressed by producing, combining and selecting solutions to it; the\ndetails of the procedure as applied to the classification problem are\nnot important for our purpose, but, for an accessible presentation,\nsee Mitchell 2009: 22; for a general introduction see Mitchell 1998).\nThe following is a diagram of the \u201cRule \\(\\phi_{17083}\\)\u201d,\ndiscovered by James Crutchfield and Melanie Mitchell (1995). The CA\nimplementing the rule starts from an initial state with more white\ncells: \n\n\n\nFig. 5\n\n\nAt time step 250 (not shown in\n Fig. 5),\n the grey areas disappear and all cells end up white, i.e., the\nclassification made by the automaton is correct. A high-level\ndescription of what is going on would have it that the white, black\nand grey regions are \u201cexpanding\u201d,\n\u201ccontracting\u201d, \u201cmoving\u201d, these being nonlinear\neffects of the low-level working of the cells computing their local\nstates, and by so doing manage to carry signals along the lattice. But\nhow are we to explain the emergent computation CA of this kind perform\nvia such nonlinear dynamics? Building on previous works on computation\ntheory applied to CA (Hanson & Crutchfield 1992; Crutchfield &\nHanson 1993), Mitchell and Crutchfield filtered out from the original\ndiagram what they call \u201cdomains\u201d, i.e., dynamically\nhomogeneous spatial regions (Crutchfield & Mitchell 1995: 10745):\n\n\n\n\nFig. 6\n\n\nAlthough in this case the \u201cdomains\u201d are manifest, it is\ncrucial to point out that their definition is rigorously mathematical.\nThe whole process of domain-detection can be carried out\nalgorithmically (see Hanson & Crutchfield 1992 for details). When\nthe boundary of a domain remains spatially localized over time, then\nthe domain becomes a \u201cparticle\u201d: \n\n\nEmbedded particles are a primary mechanism for carrying information\n(\u2026) over long space-time distances. (\u2026) Logical\noperations on the signals are performed when the particles interact.\nThe collection of domains, domain walls, particles and particle\ninteractions for a CA represents the basic information processing\nelements embedded in the CA\u2019s behavior\u2014the CA\u2019s\n\u201cintrinsic\u201d computation. (Crutchfield & Mitchell 1995:\n10744)\n\n\nThere are five stable particles (termed \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03b4,\n\u03b5, \u00b5) and one unstable particle (\u03b2) for this\nautomaton: their interaction (annihilation, decay, reaction) supports\nthe emergent logic of the system. The two circles in the image above\nare examples of what may happen during an interaction. In the first\ncase, \\(\\alpha + \\delta \\rightarrow \\mu\\), a spatial configuration\nrepresenting high, low, and then ambiguous densities is mapped to a\nhigh-density signal \u00b5; in the second, \\(\\mu + \\gamma \\rightarrow\n\\alpha\\), a spatial configuration representing high, ambiguous, and\nthen low density is mapped to an ambiguous-density signal \u03b1\n(Crutchfield & Mitchell 1995: 10745). The whole computational\nmechanics is worth being explored in more detail, but we can already\nsafely generalize to the basic philosophical point of this and related\nworks. \n\nAccording to O\u2019Connor and Wong 2015, in the context of dynamic\nsystems and the study of complexity, emergence is characterized by\nmost authors \n\n\nstrictly in terms of limits on human knowledge of complex systems.\nEmergence for such theorists is fundamentally an epistemological, not\nmetaphysical, category. (O\u2019Connor & Wong 2015: Sec. 2) \n\n\nBut the Crutchfield-Mitchell approach suggests a different\nperspective. Firstly, the emergent (both in the\n E2-\n and in the\n E3-\n sense) computational properties in CA can in an important sense be\nobjectively defined (see Crutchfield 1994a and the more accessible\nCrutchfield 1994b): although it is customary in this setting to talk\nof emergent computation being \u201cin the eye of the\nbeholder\u201d, because not explicitly encoded at the base level, the\ndetection and classification of patterns is itself algorithmic.\nSecondly, Crutchfield characterizes CA-emergence of this kind as, in a\nsense, intrinsic: the emerging patterns \u201care important\nwithin the system\u201d (Crutchfield 1994b: 3), not merely\nimportant for an observer outside the system. More precisely:\nthey are mathematically grounded on the basic features of the system,\ndespite not being explicitly mentioned in the standard abstract\ncharacterization of the program, that is, the transition rule\nimplemented in the CA cells (Crutchfield mentions as non-intrinsic\nemergent phenomena the patterns in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction\nand the energy recurrence in an harmonic oscillator chains reported by\nFermi, Pasta and Ulam\u2014see Crutchfield 1994b). \n\nCrutchfield infers from this that many cases of emergence are indeed\nnot reducible to some interaction with an observer. They are genuine\ninstances of an intrinsic phenomenon, not the results of some\nhuman-biased discovery (Crutchfield 1994b: 2). If emergence was not\nintrinsic, scientific activity would indeed be a subjective enterprise\nof \u201cpattern discovery\u201d: \n\n\nWhy? Simply because emergence defined without this closure leads to an\ninfinite regress of observers detecting patterns of observers\ndetecting patterns\u2026 (Crutchfield 1994b: 10)\n\n\nSummarizing Crutchfield\u2019s work, Miller and Page say that the\nconcept of emergence \n\n\nhas thus made the transition from metaphor to a measure, from\nsomething that could only be identified by ocular magic to something\nthat can be captured using standard statistics. (Miller & Page\n2007: 234) \n\n\nSuch remarks may sound philosophically naive to a trained\nepistemologist. It is not obvious, for instance, that the existence of\na mathematical or specifically algorithmic emergent pattern would\nblock a supposed regress entailed by a non-mathematical emergence. Why\nwould science as an activity of (occasionally) non-algorithmic pattern\ndiscovery be a merely subjective enterprise? If these claims can be\nre-phrased in a philosophically sophisticated way, though, they may\nchallenge standard definitions of weakly emergent properties\n(in the sense of Chalmers 2002). Teller 1992, Clark 1996, and Bedau\n1997, for instance, all run together instances of \u201cpattern\ndiscovery\u201d\u2014, taken as a subjective, observer-dependent\nactivity\u2014with instances of intrinsic emergence\u2014a\nphenomenon that, as we have just seen, can be characterized in the\ncontext of CA as objective and statistically significant (see the\nrelevant section of the entry on\n emergent properties).\n \n\nFinally, on to\n E4:\n emergence as incompressible unfolding. Bedau 1997 defines a\nmacro-state emergent in this sense just in case it can be\nderived from knowledge of the system\u2019s micro-components only by\ndirect simulation of the overall system evolution. Here the idea is\none of \u201cemergent phenomena as those for which\nprediction requires simulation\u201d (Clark 2013:\n134):\n E4-emergent\n macro-features would be those that can only be predicted by directly\nmodelling the micro-features, with no computational shortcut to\ncompress the information at micro-level. The first thing to notice,\naccording to Clark, is that this notion of emergence is at odds with\nat least some of the previous ones:\n E3-emergence\n has it that \n\n\nemergent phenomena are often precisely those phenomena in\nwhich complex interactions yield robust, salient patterns capable of\nsupporting prediction. (ibid) \n\n\nthat is, patterns that deliver compressible information. Next, while\nthe characterization of\n E4,\n Bedau-style emergence may work pretty well in the case of completely\nchaotic systems, it does not sit well with such CA as Rule\n\\(\\phi_{17083}\\). According to the proposed definition, the answer to\nthe classification problem given by Rule \\(\\phi_{17083}\\) is an\nemergent phenomenon just in case the only way to go from \\(t_0\\) to\n\\(t_n\\) is by explicitly simulating the system evolution.\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_0\\)\n\n\n\\(\\longrightarrow\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(t_n\\)\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, however, this is not the case. Using\nCrutchfield\u2019s particle model it is possible to predict the\nresult of the classification by simply making particle-calculations,\nwithout bothering about the underlying dynamics (Hordijk, Crutchfield,\n& Mitchell 1996). Here then, the emerging computation in the CA\nwould not be a case of emergence for Bedau. \n\nWhat about the ontological side of emergence? The issue of the reality\nof emerging patterns in CA has been examined both by reductionist\n(Dennett 2003) and by emergentist philosophers (Thompson 2007). It is\nfair to say that the CA literature so far has not significantly\ncontributed to the ongoing philosophical debate on the purely\nontological side of reductionism. CA patterns that are\n\u201cobjectively\u201d detected via computation, as per the\nMitchell-Crutchfield approach, are not ipso facto new\nprimitives to be included in an ontology. It may well be that features\nof a CA that are objective, in the sense of not depending on the\ninteraction with an observer, are nevertheless ontologically reducible\nto more basic entities via suitable definitions (see Kim 1999; Dennett\n1991). \n",
