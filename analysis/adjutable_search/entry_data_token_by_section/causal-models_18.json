    "main_text": "Probabilistic Causal Models || 0 Counterfactuals\n5. Further Reading\n\nThe most important works surveyed in this entry are Pearl 2009 and\nSpirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 2000. Pearl 2010, Pearl et al. 2016,\nand Pearl & Mackenzie 2018 are three overviews of Pearl\u2019s\nprogram. Pearl 2010 is the shortest, but the most technical. Pearl\n& Mackenzie 2018 is the least technical. Scheines 1997 and the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d of Glymour & Cooper 1999 are accessible\nintroductions to the SGS program. Eberhardt 2009, Hausman 1999,\nGlymour 2009, and Hitchcock 2009 are short overviews that cover some\nof the topics raised in this entry.\n\nThe entry on\n causation and manipulability\n contains extensive discussion of interventions, and some discussion\nof causal models.\n\nHalpern (2016) engages with many of the topics in\n Section 3.\n See also the entry for\n counterfactual theories of causation.\n\nThe entry on\n probabilistic causation\n contains some overlap with the present entry. Some of the material from\n Section 4\n of this entry is also presented in Section 3 of that entry. That\nentry contains in addition some discussion of the connection between\nprobabilistic causal models and earlier probabilistic theories of\ncausation.\n\nEberhardt 2017 is a short survey that provides a clear introduction to\nmany of the topics covered in\n Sections 4.2\n through 4.6, as well as Section\n 4.9. Spirtes and\nZhang 2016 is a longer and more technical overview that covers much of\nthe same ground. It has particularly good coverage on the issues\nraised in\n Section 4.5.\n\nThe entries on\n decision theory\n and\n causal decision theory\n present more detailed background information about some of the issues\nraised in\n Section 4.8.\n\nThis entry has focused on topics that are likely to be of most\ninterest to philosophers. There are a number of important technical\nissues that have been largely ignored. Many of these address problems\nthat arise when various simplifying assumptions made here (such as\nacyclicity, and knowledge of the true probabilities) are\nrejected. Some of these issues are briefly surveyed along with\nreferences in\n Supplement on Further Topics in Causal Inference.\n",
