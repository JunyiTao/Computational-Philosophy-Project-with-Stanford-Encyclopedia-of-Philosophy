Apart from being Del\nMedigo\u2019s lengthiest and most complex work, it also serves as the\nmost striking evidence for the latter\u2019s affinity with Paduan\nphilosophical circles, as the nature of human intellect, and in\nparticular its ontological status, was among the most hotly debated\nthemes in Padua in Del Medigo\u2019s time (see Hasse 2007, 2004: 115;\nEngel 2017: 20)\n\nThe unicity controversy was a philosophical and metaphysical as well\nas hermeneutical debate. The metaphysical aspect is reflected in the\ndiscussion concerning the nature of the human material\nintellect\u2014i.e., our potential disposition for receiving\nthoughts\u2014whether it is a single substance or multiple\nsubstances, and whether it is corporeal or separate from corporeal\nmatter. Hermeneutically, the work attempts to discern the correct\ninterpretation of certain passages from Averroes\u2019 Long\nCommentary on the De anima and, more fundamentally, of certain\npassages in Aristotle\u2019s De anima. In that work, it is\nnot quite clear what Aristotle\u2019s own position concerning the\nontological status of the human intellect is. On the one hand, the\nmaterial intellect is described as our intellect, by virtue\nof which we think. On the other hand, some of\nAristotle\u2019s remarks seem to indicate that the material intellect\nis separate in its existence from the individual human being.\nThroughout antiquity, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,\nAristotle\u2019s interpreters debated this question, with\nAverroes\u2019 discussion of it in his long commentary on the De\nanima the focal point of many of the later discussions. In\nchapter 3.5, commenting upon lines 429a21\u201324 in the De\nanima, Averroes in the long commentary stresses those aspects in\nAristotle\u2019s text which suggest that the intellect, despite\npossessing a certain relation to human individuals, is nonetheless a\nseparate substance, shared by all humans. Once the long commentary on\nthe De anima was translated into Latin, this interpretation\nwas picked up by philosophers in the Latin west from the thirteenth\ncentury onwards, among them Elijah Del Medigo.\n\nDel Medigo\u2019s first investigation thus concerns the question\nwhether the material intellect is a single substance, shared by all\nhuman beings, or whether each of us possesses her own intellect (Del\nMedigo 1482: f. 1r). Del Medigo\u2019s method in discussing the\nquestion is a dialectical one, close to that of a Scholastic\nquaestio\u2014considering the arguments for and against the\nproposed thesis (that the material intellect is one in number), before\narriving at his own (Del Medigo\u2019s) conclusion, following\nAverroes\u2019 lead in the long commentary on the De anima.\nDel Medigo\u2019s Two Investigations is therefore, at its\ncore, an attempt to both clarify Averroes\u2019 unicity thesis to\nPico as well as illustrating its validity, and Del Medigo does so\ninitially by a reductio ad absurdum of competing\ninterpretations. Del Medigo first argues against those who claimed the\nintellects are many in number, i.e., that each of us possesses her own\nintellect. This, in turn, can be interpreted in two ways, which Del\nMedigo identifies as two concrete positions in the history of\nphilosophy:\n\nThe intellect is individuated as a material disposition (The view\nof Alexander of Aphrodisias)\nThe intellect is individuated yet not as material disposition but\nas separate substance (A view which Del Medigo attributes to the\n\u201cTheologians\u201d but which in all likelihood is aimed at the\nPaduan Thomists)\n\n\nHaving refuted these two positions, i.e., the two ways according to\nwhich the intellect can be individuated, Del Medigo arrives at the\nremaining logical option: that the intellect is a separate substance,\nshared by all humans. This was the conclusion of Averroes, and Del\nMedigo then moves to illustrate the validity and coherence of this\nposition.\n\nIn the second investigation, Del Medigo explores the nature of human\nconjunction with the agent intellect, again following Averroes\u2019\ninterpretation of Aristotelian principles.\n3.3 Be\u1e25inat ha-Dat\n\nBe\u1e25inat ha-Dat is Del Medigo\u2019s last and best\nknown work, which received more scholarly attention than all of his\nother works combined. Unlike his Italian works, Be\u1e25inat\nha-Dat was composed in Hebrew at the request of Del\nMedigo\u2019s pupil, Shaul Ashkenazi, following Del Medigo\u2019s\nreturn to Crete. The overarching theme of the work is an attempt to\nlegitimise philosophical practice within the Jewish religious realm.\nThis attempt brings to mind Maimonides\u2019 Guide of the\nPerplexed, though the most immediate source\u2014which Del\nMedigo does not acknowledge for reasons which we will discuss\nbelow\u2014is Averroes\u2019 Decisive Treatise. The\nrelation between Be\u1e25inat ha-Dat and Averroes\u2019\nDecisive Treatise was discussed by various authors throughout\nthe generations (see Ivry 1983: 251; Montada 2013: 158). And most\nrecently by Giovanni Licata, who has convincingly illustrated Del\nMedigo\u2019s reliance on the Decisive Treatise by citing\nparallel passages from the two works (see Licata 2013a:\n129\u201386).\n\nWhile the works composed during Del Medigo\u2019s stay in Italy\nconcern themes in Aristotelian natural sciences and metaphysics,\nBe\u1e25inat ha-Dat may be described as meta-philosophical,\nas it discusses the relation between rational discourse and revealed\nreligion. Del Medigo begins his discussion by presenting his main\nmotivation in composing the work: to determine whether the study of\nphilosophy is permissible, forbidden, or mandatory (Del Medigo 2013:\n292). His conclusion (2013: 292\u201393) is that while the study of\nphilosophy is not obligatory as such, it is mandatory for those who\nare capable of engaging in philosophical speculation. Such engagement\nwill strengthen the student\u2019s belief, as the philosophical\nsciences concern created beings, and the knowledge of created beings\nleads to the knowledge of the creator (2013: 294). Del Medigo\nemphasises that philosophical speculation alone is insufficient from a\nreligious standpoint, as the Jewish philosopher still shares with the\nmasses a belief in the words and instructions of the Torah\n(2013: 294). The philosopher ought to supply the true interpretation\nof the biblical narrative, to be circulated only among those capable\nof philosophical reflection (2013: 294). Exceptions are the\nfundamental tenets of the Jewish belief, the validity of which ought\nnot be grounded in reason, let alone questioned. Such tenets, which\nare beyond the reach of philosophical speculation, are the possibility\nof prophecy, reward and punishment, and the possibility of miracles\n(2013: 310).\n\nThe investigation concerning valid modes of interpreting the\nTorah leads Del Medigo to discuss Kabbalistic\ninterpretations, and to present his general stand concerning the\nKabbalistic trend in Judaism (see Bland 1991). The majority of Jewish\nsages and Talmudists, Del Medigo argues (322\u2013323), rejected the\nKabbalistic interpretations and were drawn instead to philosophy and\nrational speculation. Del Medigo rejects the traditional attribution\nof Sefer ha-Zohar, the authoritative Kabbalistic work, to\nShim\u2019on Bar Yohay, and adds other arguments opposing the\nKabbalistic-mystical interpretation of the Torah. Del\nMedigo\u2019s criticism of the Kabbalah appears in his other works as\nwell, for instance in his Hebrew version of the commentary on De\nsubstantia orbis (Del Medigo 1485: f. 41; Ross 1984: 20). Yet\naccording to Ross, more than the Kabbalah itself, it was the Christian\nKabbalah that Del Medigo was attacking in the Be\u1e25inat\nha-Dat (Ross 1984: 13).\n\nAnother related theme discussed by Del Medigo concerns the reasons for\nthe commandments. Following Maimonides, Del Medigo argues that there\nis a rational foundation for prescribing the commandments to the\nJewish people, even if not all reasons are entirely known, and that\none major aspect is to \u201cdirect people to the Good, in so far as\nthey are able to\u201d (Del Medigo 2013: 336\u201338). The theme of\nthe reasons for the commandments in fact encompasses all themes\nmentioned earlier: the place of philosophical reflection within the\nreligious realm, the application of rational/philosophical\ninterpretation of the biblical narrative, and Del Medigo\u2019s\ncriticism of the Kabbalistic interpretation of the Torah.\nHere, Del Medigo\u2019s anti-Kabbalistic stand is manifested in his\ncriticism of the Kabbalistic interpretation of the commandments:\n\u201cfor we humans can hardly improve ourselves, and how can we\nimprove the divine worlds\u201d (Del Medigo 2013: 342). Lastly,\nBe\u1e25inat ha-Dat also discusses the rational status of\nthe Christian creed, arguing that unlike the fundamental principles of\nJudaism, the Christian belief is fundamentally irrational (Lasker\n2007: 25\u201328; Ross 1984: 26).\n\nAccording to Del Medigo, his role model in composing Be\u1e25inat\nha-Dat was Maimonides, who inspired him in defining the relation\nbetween philosophical speculation and religious belief. While the\ninfluence of Averroes\u2019 Decisive Treatise is apparent,\nDel Medigo never mentions the latter in Be\u1e25inat ha-Dat.\nThis is in sharp contrast to the Italian works, where Averroes was the\nultimate philosophical authority (besides Aristotle) and Maimonides is\nrarely mentioned. The discrepancy between Del Medigo\u2019s\nphilosophical and meta-philosophical works is therefore manifested\nalso in the authorities on which he relies. While Averroes was a\nleading philosophical authority among Scholastic circles in fifteenth\ncentury Padua, Maimonides\u2019 position concerning the function of\nphilosophical discourse within the religious realm had a profound\nimpact on Jewish sages all throughout the middle ages, and Maimonides\ntherefore serves Del Medigo in Be\u1e25inat ha-Dat as his\nchief authoritative source (see Ross 1984: 11).\n\nConsidering all the above, it is not surprising that Be\u1e25inat\nha-Dat caught the attention of Jewish readership and Jewish\nscholars throughout the generations, and the debates between these\nscholars summed up recently in an article by Carlos Fraenkel (Fraenkel\n2013). Certain scholars, starting with Adolph H\u00fcbsch, have argued\nthat for Del Medigo the religious and the philosophical truths were in\nfact identical. Others, beginning with Julius Guttmann, who responded\nto H\u00fcbsch, argued that Del Medigo was in act influenced by the\nChristian \u201cdouble truth\u201d theory. Fraenkel himself argues\nthat Del Medigo\u2019s\n\n\nstance on the relationship between philosophy and religion\nfundamentally agrees with that of Averroes, according to which\n\u201cthe truth does not contradict the truth\u201d. (Fraenkel 2013:\n312; for Fraenkel\u2019s discussion on H\u00fcbsch and Guttmann see\n2013: 219)\n\n\nIt is a significant fact that these scholars, while debating Del\nMedigo\u2019s position on the relation between philosophy and\nreligion, rely mostly on Del Medigo\u2019s account in\nBe\u1e25inat ha-Dat. The latter did, however, treat\nmeta-philosophical issues present in the Italian works as well. In his\nQuaestio de efficientia mundi, for instance, Del Medigo\nclearly differentiates the realm of religious belief\u2014where one\nmay endorse the belief in creation ex nihilo\u2014and the\nphilosophical truth which seems to contradict this view. Del Medigo\nspeaks in this context of two truths, one religious (\u201cvia\nlegis\u201d) and one philosophical (\u201cvia\nphilosophica\u201d) (Licata 2013a: 62). Yet this treatment,\nwhich appears as a formulation of the \u201cdouble truth\u201d\ntheory, was being introduced in the form of a side remark, mainly to\nappease the mind of his Christian readers, and was nothing like the\nsystematic treatment of the theme in Be\u1e25inat ha-Dat\n(Licata 2015: 92). The question whether Del Medigo in fact held a\ncoherent doctrine concerning the relation between revealed and\nscientific doctrines, or whether one should examine his statements on\nthe subject on an ad hoc basis, still remains open and\nrequires further study (Engel 2016).\n4. Conclusion: Impact and Legacy\n\nIn the Hebrew versions of his philosophical works, as well as in\nBe\u1e25inat ha-Dat, Del Medigo explicitly refers to himself\nas a Jewish sage and disciple of Maimonides, and often downplays the\nimportance of his own Aristotelian compositions. Del Medigo would\ntherefore have been pleased to discover that in modern scholarship he\nis mainly remembered as a Jewish thinker. Yet by judging the content\nof his Italian works, which constitute the bulk of his literary\noutput, Del Medigo\u2019s contribution to the history of philosophy\nis manifested in that he was among the first to merge, in his\ntranslations as well as in his original works, the Hebrew and Latin\nAverroist schools, which until his day existed as two separate\nphilosophical traditions. By doing so, Del Medigo contributed to the\ncreation of a unified corpus of Averroes\u2019 works, which had a\ndecisive impact on the Aristotelian Renaissance tradition and up until\nthe early modern period. In other words, despite his religious\naffiliation, Del Medigo\u2019s contribution lies clearly within the\nrealm of the Aristotelian tradition, which, qua philosophical\ntradition, transcends religious and linguistic boundaries.",
