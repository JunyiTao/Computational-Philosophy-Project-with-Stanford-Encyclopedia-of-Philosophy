    "main_text": "God\u2019s Relation to Creatures || Causation, and Creation by Intermediaries\n6.3 Causation, and Creation by Intermediaries\n\nWilliam claims \u201cthe creator alone properly and truly is worthy\nof the title \u2018cause,\u2019 but other things are merely\nmessengers and bearers of the last things received as if sent from the\ncreator\u201d (OO I, 622a; Teske 1998a, 92). We speak of creatures as\ncauses, but William says this is \u201cad sensum\u201d\n(Switalski 1976, 79; Teske and Wade 1989, 117), that is, in respect of\nhow things appear in sense experience. Both medieval and contemporary\ncommentators have on the basis of such remarks attributed to William\nthe denial that creatures are genuine causes (see Reilly 1953).\nCertainly he denies that any creature can exercise fully independent\ncausal agency, a view he thinks \u201cthe philosophers\u201d have\nadopted. But this claim is compatible with admission of genuine\nsecondary causes that are reliant for their exercise of causation on\nthe simultaneous activity of prior causes, and ultimately on that of\nthe first cause, God. Is William simply making this point but using\nthe term \u201ccause\u201d in a more restricted manner than his\ncontemporaries? A negative answer is suggested by William\u2019s\nrationale for his usage. He thinks of causation as the giving of\nbeing, and he thinks that anything that receives being, and therefore\nall creatures, cannot itself give being but can merely transmit it.\nMoreover, his metaphors of creatures as riverbeds or windows through\nwhich the divine causal influence flows strongly suggest that he\nreally does wish to hold that creatures themselves do not really bring\nanything about but are simply the conduits through which divine\ncausality flows (see Miller 1998 and 2002).\n\nWhether in fact William admits genuine causal agency among creatures,\nhe clearly thinks that God alone can create from nothing. Thus, he\nrejects Avicenna\u2019s so-called \u201cemanationist\u201d doctrine\nof creation, according to which, as he puts it, God creates from\nnothing only one thing, the first intelligence (or spiritual being),\nwhich in turn creates the next intelligence, and so on until the tenth\nor agent intelligence is reached, the creator of souls and the\nsensible world. William thinks one ground of this doctrine is\nAvicenna\u2019s principle that \u201cfrom what is one in so far as\nit is one there cannot in any way come anything but what is one\u201d\n(ex uno, secundum quod unum, non potest esse ullo modorum nisi\nunum) (OO I, 618b; Teske 1998a, 82), and hence from God, who is\nabsolutely one, can at most come one thing. In fact, William agrees\nwith this principle and applies it in the context of Trinitarian\ntheology, but he thinks Avicenna has misapplied it by using it to\nexplain creation. Instead, William follows the Jewish thinker\nAvicebron (whom he thought was a Christian) and holds that creatures\ncome from God not insofar as he is one, but \u201cthrough his will\nand insofar as he wills, just as a potter does not shape clay vessels\nthrough his oneness, but through his will\u201d (OO I, 624a; Teske\n1998a, 96).\n",
