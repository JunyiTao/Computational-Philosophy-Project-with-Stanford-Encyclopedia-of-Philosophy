    "main_text": "Problems || The View of Language\n11. Conclusion\n\nSuppose Croce were to give up the idea that art is intuition,\nand agree that the work of art is identical with the material\nwork\u2014remember this would not prevent him being an idealist in\nhis general philosophy\u2014and suppose he allowed that he was wrong\nabout language. What would remain of his theory would arguably be its\nessence: that art is expression, and we engage with it via the\nintuitive capacity. It remains individual, and perhaps\npre-conceptual.\n\nIn closing, the reader may find it useful if we summarize the major\ndifferences\u2014narrowly on matters of aesthetics\u2014between\nCroce and Collingwood, who is often thought of as Croce\u2019s\nfollower. (Indeed the question of whether, how, and to what extent\nCroce \u2018influenced\u2019 Collingwood, not only in aesthetics but\nin wider matters of metaphysics and history, are vexed questions.\nAccording to a careful study Rik Peters, the influence was perhaps\npervasive insofar as Croce influenced the questions that\nCollingwood posed for himself, but Peters concludes that the answers\ngiven were of Collingwood\u2019s own making; see Peters 2011 for\nmore; for the matter specifically about art and aesthetics, see also\nHospers 1956, Donagan 1962, and Jones 1972.) First, Collingwood seems\nto agree with Croce that art, so to speak, is everywhere\u2014there\nno self-conscious perception that lacks expressive and aesthetic\nqualities\u2014whereas Croce\u2019s theory does not tend to regard\nthe expressive content of work of art as something \u2018in the\nartist\u2019, emphasizing instead its form and later its\n\u2018universality\u2019, Collingwood tries to explain expressive\ncontent in terms of a detailed theory of the emotions. Second,\nalthough Croce does devote some energy to discrediting the\n\u2018technical\u2019 theory of art, Collingwood offers a more\norganized and detailed analysis of why art is not \u2018craft\u2019,\nthough arguably the main points are Croce\u2019s. Finally,\nCollingwood devotes his final sections to a topic left unaddressed by\nCroce: the problem of whether or in what way the responses of the\naudience can constrain the object presented by the artist.\n",
