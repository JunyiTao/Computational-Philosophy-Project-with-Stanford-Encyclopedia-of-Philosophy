    "main_text": "Equality in Social and Economic Life\n5. Equality in Social and Economic Life\n\nUnequal treatment in social and economic life\u2014in schools, public\naccommodations, employment, housing, insurance, pensions, investment,\nsports, the environment, and more\u2014has been another target of\nfeminist legal critique. Here, too, the question has been what equal\ntreatment under law requires in the face of differences, including\nsupposed biological differences, histories of discrimination, and\nentrenched social institutions. The law has developed from the removal\nof outright barriers\u2014male-only public universities, for\nexample\u2014to non-discrimination, to consideration of what\nconditions and practices adversely affect women to the extent of\ngenerating inequalities that ought to be addressed in law.\n\nIn the US from the 1940s on, courts gradually began to enforce the\nEqual Protection clause of the 14th Amendment to apply\nstrict scrutiny to state-imposed categorizations based on race; later\non, constitutional law began to address whether race and sex could be\nanalogized or even coupled for purposes of analysis (Mayeri 2011). In\n1963, the US Congress passed the Equal Pay Act, amending the Fair\nLabor Standards Act to prohibit unequal pay on the basis of sex for\n\u201cequal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal\nskill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under\nsimilar working conditions,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7206(d) (2012).\n(Congress, in a dispute about comparable worth, left open the\ninterpretive question of whether this statute requires the same pay\nfor the same work or equal pay for substantially equivalent jobs, a\ncomparable worth standard.) The Civil Rights Act of 1964 followed the\nnext year, explicitly establishing rights not to be discriminated\nagainst on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin in\nareas that included employment (Title VII), education (Title IX) and\ngovernmental benefits. Many nations have similar laws (phrased in\nvarying language) and these have been or could be of considerable\nbenefit to women, especially where bias is overt and provable.\n\nUnfortunately, in much of the world today discrimination is far from\novert, but no less effective for its increased subtlety. In some ways\nprogress toward equality has been substantial in many parts of the\nworld. But in other respects advances have been slow, even in\nprogressive nations. Enshrining equality in law is a far different\nmatter from implementing it in practice. Women have been active\nparticipants in the public sphere in large numbers in many societies\nfor thirty years or more. Yet the great majority of women remain\nclustered in the bottom or middle ranks in otherwise male dominated\nprofessions, or segregated into traditionally female fields. Politics\nremain strongly male dominated. And the top echelons of business are\nstill a male preserve: the so-called glass ceiling (Kellerman &\nRhode 2007; Fineman & Dougherty 2005; Estrich 2001). Despite\nincreased educational, political and employment opportunities for\nwomen, the feminization of poverty (Pearce 1978) continues to increase\nwhile equality of power remains elusive. Changes in divorce law and\nthe law of alimony and child support have been factors in\npoverty\u2019s feminization (Smock, Manning & Gupta 1999),\nraising questions for feminist theory about whether equality requires\nre-institution of protectionist laws. In employment, women\nconsistently earn less for comparable work in the same field, and\nfemale dominated occupations are consistently paid less than male\ndominated ones, even when the male occupations require less education\nand involve less responsibility (Kellerman & Rhode 2007; Allen\n2005; Fineman & Dougherty 2005; Roberts 2002; Estrich 2001;\nWilliams 2001; Rhode 1997). For feminist legal scholars, the\noverarching question is what roles the law should play in\nresponse.\n\nOne set of issues concerns the effects of bias that cannot be\ndemonstrated to be intentional discrimination: bias that is\nunrecognized or implicit but that is bias nonetheless. In employment\nand other areas of social and economic life, supposedly objective\nrules may be applied differently to men and women. For example, a\nwoman may be told the company does not allow part time work, but a man\nmay be allowed to cut back in order to pursue some valued activity,\nsuch as holding political office. And women are often graded or\nevaluated lower on the basis of gender alone, without the recognition\nthat this is what is taking place. Symphony orchestras famously\ndiscovered that the number of women musicians selected rose\ndramatically when applicants auditioned anonymously from behind a\nscreen (Goldin & Rouse 2000). One use of statistical evidence in\nantidiscrimination law in the US is to raise inferences of\nunrecognized bias, hence discrimination, in situations such as\nthis.\n\nA further set of issues concerns how law should address the disparate\nimpact of apparently sex-neutral policies. Even without explicit or\nimplicit bias, many longstanding policies may affect men and women\ndifferently. Policies discouraging or prohibiting part time work, when\nconsistently applied to both men and women, may still have quite\ndifferent consequences for parents with primary responsibility for\nchild care, thus disadvantaging women disproportionately. As Williams\n(2010) points out, the US continues to have a workplace structured on\nthe basis of the norms of the 1950s, assuming a breadwinner husband\nand a wife at home taking care of the children. Flexible work\nschedules, predictable shifts, consistent start and stop times, day\ntime work, or part time work at hourly rates or with benefits\nproportionately equivalent to those of full time workers simply are\nnot available to much of the workforce in the US or elsewhere.\nMoreover, the US, unlike other advanced industrial societies, has no\ngeneral statutory requirement for paid family leave.\n\nThese many policies pose classic dilemmas of difference and can be\ndeconstructed by understanding the male norms they assume, as\ndiscussed in Section 1. Employment policies concerning pregnancy are\nnotorious examples warranting separate mention. At one point, the U.S.\nSupreme Court concluded that failure to cover pregnancy under state or\nemployer disability insurance programs was not discrimination on the\nbasis of sex, as it differentiated between pregnant persons and\nnon-pregnant persons.\n (Geduldig v. Aiello,\n 417 U.S. 484 (1974);\n General Electric Co. v. Gilbert,\n 429 U.S. 125 (1976)). Since pregnancy did not affect all women,\ndenying pregnancy benefits did not discriminate against women on the\nbasis of sex, or so the reasoning went, although these policies would\ncertainly have different impacts on women than on men. Men and women\nwere being treated the same: neither received pregnancy benefits. So\nmen did not receive any benefits that women did not receive. And women\ndid not receive any benefits that men did not receive. The logical\nimplication was that requiring a benefits program to include pregnancy\nbenefits for women would entitle them not to equal rights, but to\nspecial rights; not to equal treatment but to special treatment (Olsen\n1995; Smith 1993; Bartlett & Kennedy 1991). Feminists were stunned\nby this argument\u2014after all, only women can become\npregnant\u2014and the US Congress enacted the Pregnancy\nDiscrimination Act several years later.  The most recent\nbattleground over apparently neutral rules has been the recognition of\nexceptions for employers with religious objections from providing\ncontraceptive coverage for their employees.\n\nIn addition, some policies that differentiate based on sex may be\nperceived as just or as beneficial to women. Affirmative action\npolicies designed to root out the lingering effects of prior\ndiscrimination are an example of policies differentiating on the basis\nof sex that may be regarded as just. Other policies have been seen\njustified on a variety of grounds, including benefits to society,\nbenefits to women, or distributive justice. In the US, these have\nincluded excluding women from jury duty based on their supposed\nresponsibilities in the home, giving survivor\u2019s benefits to\nwidows but not to widowers, and creating single-sex schools. To some\ncritics, all of these policies violate formal equality. To feminists,\nunderlying issues for achieving equality include determining whether\nany of these policies enforce stereotypes, entrench prejudice, or\ntreat anyone unfairly\u2014and whether law should be used to\nchallenge them as a result.\n\nMoreover, sex is not the only ground of legally actionable\ndiscrimination. Some critical race theorists, queer theorists,\ndisability theorists, and other feminist legal philosophers have both\nclarified and complicated the issue of equality and difference by\npointing to discrimination based on race, class, ethnicity, sexual\norientation, disability and age (Mayeri 2011; Nussbaum 2006; Allen\n2005; Crenshaw 1996, 1989; Valdes 1995; Matsuda 1987). As discussed\nabove, the scholarship on intersectionality creates complex pictures\nof identity and the structure of discrimination. For example,\nemployment discrimination against women of color may not be simply a\nmatter of race-plus or sex-plus, but a phenomenon of interaction\nbetween these and possibly other categories. Some feminists have\npointed out as a problem in particular of liberal feminism that much\nof its focus is directed to the concerns of white, middle class,\nprofessional women (Williams 2011, 1997, 1992; Roberts 2002; Crenshaw\net al. 1996). \n\nFor all these reasons, women remain at a serious disadvantage both at\nwork and at home (Williams 2010; Fineman & Dougherty 2005; Roberts\n2002; Okin 1995). In the workplace it has been noted that despite the\nmany forms of discrimination described above, many women are able to\nprogress quite well as long as they function as perfect workers (i.e.\nas men). These women also have the greatest legal resources to combat\ndiscrimination, which shows that the workplace has changed little and\nthat the standard of evaluation is still male (Williams 2010; Fineman\n2004; Estrich 2001). This precludes women from being mothers and still\nbeing treated as equals in the workplace. Many instances of\ndiscrimination appear to start when a woman becomes a mother, even if\nher work product has not changed. And many women find themselves in\nthe double bind of being disliked and disapproved of as bad mothers or\ndiscounted and disrespected as uncommitted workers. This has been\nidentified as discrimination and is often legally actionable. Joan\nWilliams (2001) has called this additional barrier the \u201cmaternal\nwall\u201d and adds it to the glass ceiling as a form of illegal\ndiscrimination. But it remains difficult to prove and difficult to\ncounteract. Feminist philosophers of law have offered a variety of\nproposals for counteracting it (Allen 2005; Fineman 2004; Estrich\n2001; Williams 2001; Rhode 1997). Some societies handle the\ncoordination of family and work better than others, and some progress\nhas been made in some places; but the burdens of domestic labor in the\nprivate sphere remain greatly undervalued and largely invisible, and\nthe stereotype of the domestic and nurturing mother is deeply\nentrenched.\n\nThe economic disadvantages of women at work are reinforced by domestic\ndisadvantages, either as a formal matter of family law or in the\nimplicit biases in how apparently neutral rules are applied. While\nmost societies idealize the role of the mother, her domestic work is\nconsistently undervalued or unpaid. As a result, often when mothers\nseek divorce, child custody, and property settlements they are gravely\ndisadvantaged (Fineman 2004; Williams 2001; Weitzman 1992, 1987). In\nsome societies the de-valued status of wives and daughters leaves them\nwithout inheritance, property, or even without adequate food, health\ncare, or education (Carr et al. 1996; Okin 1995; Sen 1995; Chen\n1995,1983). Many feminist legal scholars have offered proposals for\nrevising some family laws with some modest success. Some have\nsuggested pay scales for traditional domestic duties and alternative\nmodels for custody suits and property settlements (Williams 2001; Jain\n1995; Olsen 1983). And some feminists have analyzed the domestic ideal\nitself, suggesting an alternative legal model of the family. Martha\nFineman (2004, 1995) has argued that the state has no reason to\nreinforce and privilege the sexual family\u2014the sexual relation\nbetween a man and a woman that is the traditional basis of marriage as\na legal institution. Rather, the care-giving relation is what should\nbe encouraged and supported by the state. One problem with the\ncare-giving role is that it makes the care-giver dependent on another\nsource of income, typically and traditionally a breadwinner. It is\nthis dependent status of the care-giver that needs to be addressed in\nlaw and public policy, assuming that care-giving is a positive and\nindeed a crucial role in human life. According to this view, the myth\nof autonomy is an unfortunate side effect of a male perspective that\ntends to make the private domestic sphere both invisible and de-valued\n(Fineman 2004, 1995). And this issue is further complicated by the\nintersection of gender with race and class (Roberts 2002).\n\nThis de-valuation and invisibility has contributed directly to the\nfeminization of poverty, which is now a problem of global proportions.\nGlobal poverty is getting worse, and increasingly women bear the brunt\nof it. Two billion people (about one out of three) live in extreme\npoverty on less than two dollars a day. About 800 million go to bed\nhungry every night, and eight million die from poverty related causes\neach year. More than seventy per cent of them (nearly three fourths)\nare female. So serious are the effects of extreme poverty on women\n(and girls) that the World Health Organization has named it a disease\n(\u201cextreme poverty,\u201d coded Z59.5) and called it \u201cthe\nworld\u2019s most ruthless killer\u201d (Jain 2005, p. 138).\n\nThe reasons for the feminization of poverty are complex and differ in\nimportant respects by culture. Some women are poor because their\nsociety is poor\u2014devastated by natural disasters or war and\nsocial turmoil, or sapped by corrupt officials or colonial powers.\nSome are refugees, and some are sick, old, or disabled. Many of the\npoor are children. It has been noted that extreme poverty for both men\nand women is attributable to a variety of entrenched traditional\nstructures such as class or caste hierarchies, ethnic or religious\ndiscrimination and unequal land distribution (Carr, Chen &\nJhabvala 1996). And often these long term structural problems are\naggravated by globalization, world markets, economic restructuring and\nsuch recent trends in the world economy. Women\u2019s poverty results\nfrom all these factors: being part of a poor family, village, or\nregion, but is compounded by the subordination of women within the\nfamily, community or social structure at large. When poverty is bad it\nis worse for women. When food and medicine are short the most deprived\nare women and girls. Norms of seclusion\u2014exclusion from\ninheritance, lack of credit, lack of training and education\u2014all\ndisadvantage women and girls. In all societies the poorest women carry\ncompounded burdens of discrimination by race, class, caste or religion\nas well as sex discrimination (Roberts 1995; Chen 1995; Crenshaw 1989;\nMatsuda 1987).\n\nMany programs have been proposed and initiated to alleviate this\nproblem. Women\u2019s unions and cooperative associations have been\nformed. New models of credit and lending are being tested. The UN,\nvarious NGOs and Women\u2019s Organizations, as well as national and\nlocal organizations, have been working to increase opportunities for\nliteracy and employment for women and girls (Jain, 2005; Carr, Chen\n& Jhabvala 1996; Nussbaum & Glover 1995). Pioneers of\nmicro-lending Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank received the Nobel\nPeace Prize in 2006. Yet poverty and polarization are increasing in\nmany societies. Many feminists are now of the view that reform of\neconomic and social institutions is critical to the well being of\nwomen. The sharp distinction between public and private labor needs to\nbe recognized as an artificial one (Fineman and Dougherty 2005). As\nnoted by Chen, \u201cso long as policy-makers make the artificial\ndistinction between the farm and the household, between paid work and\nunpaid work, between productive and domestic work, women will continue\nto be overlooked\u201d (1983, p. 220). Thus, the interaction between\nprivate labor and the public good must be, and is beginning to be,\nacknowledged. For example, Chen (2011) argues, contributions of unpaid\nlabor should be included in estimates of GDPs; contributions of work\nin the informal sector (which tends to be dominated by women and low\nincome men) is increasingly being included in national and\ninstitutional studies potentially affecting economic policy; and\nunpaid domestic labor is now sometimes considered as having monetary\nvalue in court cases.\n\nSome feminists have concluded that, like the dominance model of\nsexuality, the domestic model of women\u2019s unpaid labor may not be\naddressed by denouncing it directly. It may also require incremental\nerosion by addressing its causes and effects. That is, it must\ngradually be replaced with a better model. According to Chen (1995,\n1983), for example, (ideological) arguments for the equality of women\nin rural India and Bangladesh were met with great resistance, but when\nthe approach was revised to provide pragmatic assistance for economic\ndevelopment to poor women that substantially improved their lives (and\nthus the lives of their families) resistance substantially decreased.\nDreze and Sen (1989, p. 58) have noted \u201cconsiderable evidence\nthat greater involvement in outside work does tend to go with less\nanti-female bias in intra-family distribution.\u201d Respect for\nwomen arguably increases as their independence increases.\n\nCommunist societies that purported to institute equality for women\nfrom the top down, so to speak, failed to accomplish their goal\nprecisely by overlooking the obvious conflict between the perfect\nmother and the perfect worker. For example, commentators such as Li\n(1995) contend that in China the Communist model of equality\nsuperimposed a thin veneer of equal gender relations over 5,000 year\nold patriarchal customs that strongly socialized women to the roles of\nobedient and deferential wife and daughter. Combining these norms with\nCommunist women\u2019s equal obligations as workers created double\nobligations for women without any real recognition of the double role\nas a double burden (Li 1995). Some feminists have noted that the\nSoviet Communist idea of gender equality and its post-communist\ndevelopment created a triple burden, as women were expected to\nfunction in three roles: wife and mother; good worker or professional;\nand social activist (Petrova 1993). And today, as women enter the\npublic sphere around the globe, they carry the burdens of the private\nsphere with them, because the institutional structure has not been\nchanged to accommodate social and economic evolution or to recognize\nthe value of traditional women\u2019s work (Fineman 2004, 1995).\n\nMany feminists have concluded at this point that it is critical to\nmainstream women into the public sphere, thereby increasing their\nvisibility as economic contributors and, thus, their control over\ntheir own lives. It is crucial to weaken the public/private\ndistinction to make the general work environment more hospitable to\nparents and caregivers in general. And it is imperative to continue to\nraise feminist consciousness: to identify the bias of male norms, and\nyet to attend to the contextual surroundings necessary for an accurate\nassessment of complex human relations, as well as pragmatic solutions\nto longstanding entrenched inequality. Law is a critical tool in this\neffort (Stark 2004; Williams 2000; Okin 1995).\n",
