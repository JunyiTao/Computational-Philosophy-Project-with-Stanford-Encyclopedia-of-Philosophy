    "main_text": "Applications of the Logistic Method || The Slingshot Argument\n3.2 The Slingshot Argument\n\nIn Frege\u2019s logical system, declarative sentences stand for\n(bedeuten) truth values, which are two distinct abstract\nobjects in Frege\u2019s ontology. Thus Frege treated such sentences\nas a special kind of name. But others, Carnap in particular, viewed\nsentences as standing for propositions. In response, Church gave an\nargument, directly traceable to Frege, that the denotations of\nsentences are indeed their truth values, and so cannot be propositions\nas Carnap supposed. (While we prefer \u201cdesignate\u201d we will\nfollow Church and use \u201cdenote\u201d in this section.) This\nargument has become known as \u201cthe Slingshot\u201d, invoking the\nslaying of Goliath by David, for its ability to refute looming\nhypotheses such as that sentences are correlated directly with facts\nor propositions.\n\nChurch argued that sentences must stand for truth values, for\nif sentences stood for propositions, there would only be two\npropositions. A similar argument that all true sentences stand for the\nsame thing (and that all false sentences stand for a distinct thing)\nwas suggested by G\u00f6del (1944; for an extended discussion of truth\nvalues, the slingshot, and generalized truth values see the entry on\n truth values).\n Here we focus exclusively on Church\u2019s review, and his related\ncommentary in (1956a: \u00a704), which constitute the locus\nclassicus of the Slingshot argument.\n\nHere is a simple, ingenious, logic-notation-free version of the\nargument given by Church (1956a: \u00a704): Assume first that\nsentences do denote something or other. Now consider the following\nlist of sentences:\n\n(1)\nSir Walter Scott is the author of Waverley\n(2)\nSir Walter Scott is Sir Walter Scott\n(3)\nSir Walter Scott is the man who wrote twenty-nine Waverley novels\naltogether\n(4)\nThe number such that Sir Walter Scott is the man who wrote that\nmany Waverley novels is twenty-nine.\n(5)\nThe number of counties in Utah is twenty-nine.\n\n\nChurch argued that (1) and (5), which seem totally unrelated in\nmeaning, must denote the same thing, namely, their truth value (since\nthat is all they have in common). The only additional assumptions\nChurch works with are the following two:\n\n(A)\nCo-denoting names or definite descriptions are\ninterchangeable.\n\n(B)\nSynonymous sentences (or, Church remarks, nearly synonymous\nsentences such as (3) and (4)) have the same denotation.\n\n\nAssumption (A) allows that an occurrence of a name or a definite\ndescription N in a sentence S may be replaced by a name or description\nM that denotes the same thing without altering the denotation of S.\nThus, (2) comes from (1) by (A). (But it is not clear what role, if\nany, (2) plays in the argument.) (3) comes from (1) by (A); (4) comes\nfrom (3) by (B); and (5) comes from (4) by (A). A similar argument can\nbe used to show that all false sentences denote the same thing. A\nfurther conclusion, important to Church, is that if, as this argument\nseems to demonstrate, (1) and (5) denote the same thing, this cannot\nbe the propositions expressed by each, since those are clearly\ndifferent. (For further discussion see\n supplement C.1\n as well as the supplement to the entry on\n truth values.)\n",
