If one thinks of\na debate as a kind of game, then Aristotle already made the\nconnection; his writings about syllogism are closely intertwined with\nhis study of the aims and rules of debating. Aristotle\u2019s\nviewpoint survived into the common medieval name for logic:\ndialectics. In the mid twentieth century Charles Hamblin\nrevived the link between dialogue and the rules of sound reasoning,\nsoon after Paul Lorenzen had connected dialogue to constructive\nfoundations of logic. \n\nThere are close links between games and teaching. Writers throughout\nthe medieval period talk of dialogues as a way of\n\u2018teaching\u2019 or \u2018testing\u2019 the use of sound\nreasoning. We have at least two textbooks of logic from the early\nsixteenth century that present it as a game for an individual student,\nand Lewis Carroll\u2019s The Game of Logic (1887) is another\nexample in the same genre. There are plenty of modern examples too,\nthough probably there has not been enough continuity to justify\ntalking of a tradition of teaching logic by games. \n\nMathematical game theory was founded in the early twentieth century.\nAlthough no mathematical links with logic emerged until the 1950s, it\nis striking how many of the early pioneers of game theory are also\nknown for their contributions to logic: John Kemeny, J. C. C.\nMcKinsey, John von Neumann, Willard Quine, Julia Robinson, Ernst\nZermelo and others. In 1953 David Gale and Frank Stewart made fruitful\nconnections between set theory and games. Shortly afterwards Leon\nHenkin suggested a way of using games to give semantics for infinitary\nlanguages.\n\nThe first half of the twentieth century was an era of increasing\nrigour and professionalism in logic, and to most logicians of that\nperiod the use of games in logic would probably have seemed frivolous.\nThe intuitionist L. E. J. Brouwer expressed this attitude when he\naccused his opponents of causing mathematics \u2018to degenerate into\na game\u2019 (as David Hilbert quoted him in 1927, cited in van\nHeijenoort 1967). Hermann Weyl (cited in Mancosu 1998) used the notion\nof games to explain Hilbert\u2019s metamathematics: mathematical\nproofs proceed like plays of a meaningless game, but we can stand\noutside the game and ask meaningful questions about it.\nWittgenstein\u2019s language games provoked little response from the\nlogicians. But in the second half of the century the centre of gravity\nof logical research moved from foundations to techniques, and from\nabout 1960 games were used more and more often in logical papers.\n\nBy the beginning of the twenty-first century it had become widely\naccepted that games and logic go together. The result was a huge\nproliferation of new combinations of logic and games, particularly in\nareas where logic is applied. Many of these new developments sprang\noriginally from work in pure logic, though today they follow their own\nagendas. One such area is argumentation theory, where games form a\ntool for analysing the structure of debates. \n\nBelow we will concentrate on those games that are most closely\nassociated with pure logic.\n",
