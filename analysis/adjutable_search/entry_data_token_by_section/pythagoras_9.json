    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Pythagoras || The Pythagorean Way of Life\n4.3 The Pythagorean Way of Life\n\n\nThe testimony of both Plato (R. 600a) and Isocrates\n(Busiris 28) shows that Pythagoras was above all famous for\nhaving left behind him a way of life, which still had adherents in the\nfourth century over 100 years after his death. It is plausible to\nassume that many features of this way of life were designed to insure\nthe best possible future reincarnations, but it is important to\nremember that nothing in the early evidence connects the way of life\nto reincarnation in any specific fashion. \n\n\nOne of the clearest strands in the early evidence for Pythagoras is\nhis expertise in religious ritual. Isocrates emphasizes that \u201che\nmore conspicuously than others paid attention to sacrifices and\nrituals in temples\u201d (Busiris 28). Herodotus gives an\nexample: the Pythagoreans agree with the Egyptians in not allowing the\ndead to be buried in wool (II. 81). It is not surprising that\nPythagoras, as an expert on the fate of the soul after death. should\nalso be an expert on the religious rituals surrounding death. A\nsignificant part of the Pythagorean way of life thus consisted in the\nproper observance of religious ritual. One major piece of evidence for\nthis emphasis on ritual is the symbola or acusmata\n(\u201cthings heard\u201d), short maxims that were handed down\norally. The earliest source to quote acusmata is Aristotle,\nin the fragments of his now lost treatise on the Pythagoreans. It is\nnot always possible to be certain which of the acusmata\nquoted in the later tradition go back to Aristotle and which of the\nones that do go back to Pythagoras. Most of Iamblichus\u2019 examples in\nsections 82\u201386 of On the Pythagorean Life, however,\nappear to derive from Aristotle (Burkert 1972a, 166 ff.), and many are\nin accord with the early evidence we have for Pythagoras\u2019 interest in\nritual. Thus the\nacusmata advise Pythagoreans to pour libations to the gods\nfrom the ear (i.e., the handle) of the cup, to refrain from wearing\nthe images of the gods on their fingers, not to sacrifice a white\ncock, and to sacrifice and enter the temple barefoot. A number of\nthese practices can be paralleled in Greek mystery religions of the\nday (Burkert 1972a, 177). Indeed, it is important to emphasize that\nPythagoreanism was not a religion and there were no specific\nPythagorean rites (Burkert 1985, 302). Pythagoras rather taught a way\nof life that emphasized certain aspects of traditional Greek\nreligion. \n\n\nA second characteristic of the Pythagorean way of life was the\nemphasis on dietary restrictions. There is no direct evidence for\nthese restrictions in the pre-Aristotelian evidence, but both\nAristotle and Aristoxenus discuss them extensively. Unfortunately the\nevidence is contradictory and it is difficult to establish any points\nwith certainty. One might assume that Pythagoras advocated\nvegetarianism on the basis of his belief in metempsychosis, as did\nEmpedocles after him (Fr. 137). Indeed, the fourth-century\nmathematician and philosopher Eudoxus says that \u201che not only\nabstained from animal food but would also not come near butchers and\nhunters\u201d (Porphyry, VP 7). According to Dicaearchus,\none of Pythagoras\u2019 most well-known doctrines was that \u201call\nanimate beings are of the same family\u201d (Porphyry, VP\n19), which suggests that we should be as hesitant about eating other\nanimals as other humans.  Unfortunately, Aristotle reports that\n\u201cthe Pythagoreans refrain from eating the womb and the heart,\nthe sea anemone and some other such things but use all other animal\nfood\u201d (Aulus Gellius IV. 11. 11\u201312). This makes it sound\nas if Pythagoras forbade the eating of just certain parts of animals\nand certain species of animals rather than all animals; such specific\nprohibitions are easy to parallel elsewhere in Greek ritual (Burkert\n1972a, 177). Aristoxenus asserts that Pythagoras only refused to eat\nplough oxen and rams (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 20) and that he was fond\nof young kids and suckling pigs as food (Aulus Gellius\nIV. 11. 6). Some have tried to argue that Aristoxenus is refashioning\nPythagoreanism in order to make it more rational (e.g., Kahn 2001, 70;\nZhmud 2012b, 228), but Aristoxenus, in fact, recognizes the\nnon-rational dimension of Pythagoreanism and Pythagoras\u2019 eating of\nkids and suckling pigs may itself have religious motivations (Huffman\n2012b). Moreover, even if Aristoxenus\u2019 evidence were set aside\nAristotle\u2019s testimony and many of the\nacusmata indicate that Pythagoras ate some meat. Certainly\nanimal sacrifice was the central act of Greek religious worship and to\nabolish it completely would be a radical step. The acusma\nreported by Aristotle, in response to the question \u201cwhat is most\njust?\u201d has Pythagoras answer \u201cto sacrifice\u201d\n(Iamblichus, VP 82). Based on the direct evidence for\nPythagoras\u2019 practice in Aristotle and Aristoxenus, it seems most\nprudent to conclude that he did not forbid the eating of all animal\nfood. The later tradition proposes a number of ways to reconcile\nmetempsychosis with the eating of some meat. Pythagoras may have\nadopted one of these positions, but no certainty is possible. For\nexample, he may have argued that it was legitimate to kill and eat\nsacrificial animals, on the grounds that the souls of men do not enter\ninto these animals (Iamblichus, VP 85). Perhaps the most\nfamous of the Pythagorean dietary restrictions is the prohibition on\neating beans, which is first attested by Aristotle and assigned to\nPythagoras himself (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 34). Aristotle suggests a\nnumber of explanations including one that connects beans with Hades,\nhence suggesting a possible connection with the doctrine of\nmetempsychosis. A number of later sources suggest that it was believed\nthat souls returned to earth to be reincarnated through beans (Burkert\n1972a, 183). There is also a physiological explanation. Beans, which\nare difficult to digest, disturb our abilities to concentrate.\nMoreover, the beans involved are a European vetch (Vicia\nfaba) rather than the beans commonly eaten today. Certain people\nwith an inherited blood abnormality develop a serious disorder called\nfavism, if they eat these beans or even inhale their\npollen. Aristoxenus interestingly denies that Pythagoras forbade the\neating of beans and says that \u201che valued it most of all\nvegetables, since it was digestible and laxative\u201d (Aulus Gellius\nIV.  11.5). The discrepancies between the various fourth-century\naccounts of the Pythagorean way of life suggest that there were\ndisputes among fourth-century Pythagoreans as to the proper way of\nlife and as to the teachings of Pythagoras himself.\n\n\nThe acusmata indicate that the Pythagorean way of life\nembodied a strict regimen not just regarding religious ritual and diet\nbut also in almost every aspect of life. Some of the restrictions\nappear to be largely arbitrary taboos, e.g., \u201cone must put the\nright shoe on first\u201d or \u201cone must not travel the public\nroads\u201d (Iamblichus, VP 83, probably from Aristotle). On\nthe other hand, some aspects of the Pythagorean life involved a moral\ndiscipline that was greatly admired, even by outsiders. Pythagorean\nsilence is an important example. Isocrates reports that even in the\nfourth century people \u201cmarvel more at the silence of those who\nprofess to be his pupils than at those who have the greatest\nreputation for speaking\u201d (Busiris 28). The ability to\nremain silent was seen as important training in self-control, and the\nlater tradition reports that those who wanted to become Pythagoreans\nhad to observe a five-year silence (Iamblichus, VP\n72). Isocrates is contrasting the marvelous self-control of\nPythagorean silence with the emphasis on public speaking in\ntraditional Greek education.  Pythagoreans also displayed great\nloyalty to their friends as can be seen in Aristoxenus\u2019 story of Damon\nwho is willing to stand surety for his friend Phintias, who has been\nsentenced to death (Iamblichus, VP 233 ff.). In addition to\nsilence as a moral discipline, there is evidence that secrecy was kept\nabout certain of the teachings of Pythagoras. Aristoxenus reports that\nthe Pythagoreans thought that \u201cnot all things were to be spoken\nto all people\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, VIII. 15), but this may only\napply to teaching and mean that children should not be taught all\nthings (Zhmud 2012a, 155). Clearer evidence is found in Dicaearchus\u2019\ncomplaint that it is not easy to say what Pythagoras taught his pupils\nbecause they observed no ordinary silence about it\n(Porphyry, VP 19). Indeed, one would expect that an exclusive\nsociety such as that of the Pythagoreans would have secret doctrines\nand symbols. Aristotle says that the Pythagoreans \u201cguarded among\ntheir very secret doctrines that one type of rational being is divine,\none human, and one such as Pythagoras\u201d (Iamblichus, VP\n31). That there should be secret teachings about the special nature\nand authority of the master is not surprising. This does not mean,\nhowever, that all Pythagorean philosophy was secret. Aristotle\ndiscusses the fifth-century metaphysical system of Philolaus in some\ndetail with no hint that there was anything secret about it, and\nPlato\u2019s discussion of Pythagorean harmonic theory in Book VII of the\nRepublic gives no suggestion of any secrecy.  Aristotle\nsingles out the acusma quoted above (Iamblichus, VP\n31) as secret, but this statement in itself implies that others were\nnot. The idea that all of Pythagoras\u2019 teachings were secret was used\nin the later tradition to explain the lack of Pythagorean writings and\nto try to validate forged documents as recently discovered secret\ntreatises. For a sceptical evaluation of Pythagorean secrecy see Zhmud\n2012a, 150\u2013158.\n\n\nThere is some controversy as to whether Pythagoras, in fact, taught a\nway of life governed in great detail by the acusmata as\ndescribed above. Plato praises the Pythagorean way of life in\nthe Republic (600b), but it is hard to imagine him admiring\nthe set of taboos found in the acusmata (Lloyd 2014, 44;\nZhmud 2012a). Although acusmata were collected already by\nAnaximander of Miletus the younger (ca. 400 BCE) and by Aristotle in\nthe fourth century, Zhmud (2012a, 177\u2013178 and 192\u2013205) argues that\nvery few of these embody specifically Pythagorean ideas and that it is\ndifficult to imagine anyone following this bewildering set of rules\nliterally as Burkert argues (1972a, 191). However, the early evidence\nsuggests that Pythagoras largely constructed the acusmata out\nof ideas collected from others (Thom 2013; Huffman 2008b: Gemelli\nMarciano 2002), so it is no surprise that many of them are not\nuniquely Pythagorean. Moreover, Thom suggests a middle ground between\nZhmud and Burkert whereby, contra Zhmud, most of the acusmata\nwere followed by the Pythagoreans but contra Burkert, they were\nsubject to interpretation from the beginning and not followed\nliterally, so that it is possible to imagine people living according\nto them (Thom, 2013). It is true that there is little if any fifth-\nand fourth-century evidence for Pythagoreans living according to\nthe acusmata and Zhmud argues that the undeniable political\nimpact of the Pythagoreans would be inexplicable if they lived the\nheavily ritualized life of the acusmata, which would\ninevitably isolate them from society (Zhmud 2012a, 175\u2013183). He\nsuggests that the Pythagorean way of life differed little from\nstandard aristocratic morality (Zhmud 2012a, 175). If, however, the\nPythagorean way of life was little out of the ordinary, why do Plato\nand Isocrates specifically comment on how distinctive those who\nfollowed it were? The silence of fifth-century sources about people\npracticing acusmata is not terribly surprising given the very\nmeager sources for the Greek cities in southern Italy in the\nperiod. Why not suppose that the vast majority of names in\nAristoxenus\u2019 catalogue of Pythagoreans, who are not associated with\nany political, philosophical or scientific accomplishment, who are\njust names to us, are preceisely those who were Pythagoreans because\nthey followed the Pythagorean way of life? We would then have lots of\npeople who followed the acusmata (166 of the 222 name in the\ncatalogue appear nowhere else). This suspicion is confirmed by the\nfact that one of the names from Arsitoxenus\u2019 catalogue (Hippomedon of\nArgos) is elsewhere (Iamblichus, On the Pythagorean Life, 87)\nexplicitly said to belong the acusmatici. Moreover, other\nscholars argue that archaic Greek society in southern Italy was\npervaded by religion and the presence of similar precepts in authors\nsuch as Hesiod show that adherence to taboos such as are found in\nthe acusmata would not have caused a scandal and adherence to\nmany of them would have gone unobserved by outsiders (Gemelli Marciano\n2014, 133\u2013134).\n\n\nOnce again a problem of source criticism raises its head. Zhmud argues\nthat the split between acusmatici who blindly followed\nthe acusmata and the mathematici who learned the\nreasons for them (see the fifth paragraph of section 5 below) is a\ncreation of the later tradition, appearing first in Clement of\nAlexandria and disappearing after Iamblichus (Zhmud 2012a,\n169\u2013192). He also notes that the term acusmata appears first\nin Iamblichus (On the Pythagorean Life 82\u201386) and suggests\nthat it is also a creation of the later tradition. The Pythagorean\nmaxims did exist earlier, as the testimony of Aristotle shows, but\nthey were known as symbola, were originally very few in\nnumber and were mainly a literary phenomena rather than being tied to\npeople who actually practiced them (Zhmud 2012a, 192\u2013205). However,\nseveral scholars have argued that the passages in which the split\nbetween the acusmatici and mathematici is described\nas well as the passage in which the term acusmata is used, in\nfact, go back to Aristotle (Burkert 1972a, 196; see Burkert 1998, 315\nwhere he comments that the Aristotelian provenance of the text is \u201cas\nobvious as it is unprovable\u201d) and even Zhmud recognizes that a large\npart of the material in Iamblichus is derived from Aristotle (2012a,\n170). Indeed, the description of the split in what is likely to be the\noriginal version (Iamblichus, On General Mathematical Science\n76.16\u201377.18 Festa) uses language in describing the Pythagoreans that\nis almost an Aristotelian signature, \u201cThere are two forms of the\nItalian philosophy which is called Pythagorean\u201d\n(76.16). Aristotle famously describes the Pythagoreans as \u201cthose\ncalled Pythagoreans\u201d and also describes them as \u201cthe\nItalians\u201d (e.g., Mete. 342b30, Cael.\n293a20). So the question of whether Pythagoras taught a way of life\ntightly governed by the acusmata turns again on whether key\npassages in Iamblichus (On the Pythagorean Life 81\u201387, On\nGeneral Mathematical Science 76.16\u201377.18 Festa) go back to\nAristotle. If they do, we have very good reason to believe that\nPythagoras taught such a life, if they do not the issue is less\nclear.\n\n\nThe testimony of fourth-century authors such as Aristoxenus and\nDicaearchus indicates that the Pythagoreans also had an important\nimpact on the politics and society of the Greek cities in southern\nItaly. Dicaearchus reports that, upon his arrival in Croton,\nPythagoras gave a speech to the elders and that the leaders of the\ncity then asked him to speak to the young men of the town, the boys\nand the women (Porphyry, VP 18). Women, indeed, may have\nplayed an unusually large role in Pythagoreanism (see Rowett 2014,\n122\u2013123), since both Timaeus and Dicaearchus report on the fame of\nPythagorean women including Pythagoras\u2019 daughter\n(Porphyry, VP 4 and 19). The\nacusmata teach men to honor their wives and to beget children\nin order to insure worship for the gods (Iamblichus, VP\n84\u20136). Dicaearchus reports that the teaching of Pythagoras was\nlargely unknown, so that Dicaearchus cannot have known of the content\nof the speech to the women or of any of the other speeches; the\nspeeches presented in Iamblichus (VP 37\u201357) are thus\nlikely to be later forgeries (Burkert 1972a, 115), but there is early\nevidence that he gave different speeches to different groups\n(Antisthenes V A 187). The attacks on the Pythagoreans both in\nPythagoras\u2019 own day and in the middle of the fifth century are\npresented by Dicaearchus and Aristoxenus as having a wide-reaching\nimpact on Greek society in southern Italy; the historian Polybius\n(II. 39) reports that the deaths of the Pythagoreans meant that\n\u201cthe leading citizens of each city were destroyed,\u201d which\nclearly indicates that many Pythagoreans had positions of political\nauthority. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that Plato explicitly\npresents Pythagoras as a private rather than a public figure\n(R. 600a). It seems most likely that the Pythagorean\nsocieties were in essence private associations but that they also\ncould function as political clubs (see Zhmud 2012a, 141\u2013148), while\nnot being a political party in the modern sense; their political\nimpact should perhaps be better compared to modern fraternal\norganizations such as the Masons. Thus, the Pythagoreans did not rule\nas a group but had political impact through individual members who\ngained positions of authority in the Greek city-states in southern\nItaly.
