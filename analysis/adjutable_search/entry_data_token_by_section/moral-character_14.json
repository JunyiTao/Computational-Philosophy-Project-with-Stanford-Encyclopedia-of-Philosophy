The objectors say that the situationists\nrely on an understanding of character traits as isolated and often\nnon-reflective dispositions to behave in stereotypical ways. They\nwrongly assume that traits can be determined from a single type of\nbehavior stereotypically associated with that trait.\n\nConsider again the payphone and seminarian studies. It may seem\nobvious that one cannot respond to all appeals for help, and it may\nseem doubtful that any reflective person thinks one should. This\nsuggests that being a helpful person requires some thinking about what\nis most important in one\u2019s life, for calls of help can\njustifiably go unanswered if the individual believes that responding\nwill interfere with her doing something else that she takes to be of\nhigher moral importance. So we should not expect helping behavior to\nbe wholly consistent, given the complex situations in which persons\nfind themselves. Some of the philosophers discussed in this entry,\nsuch as the natural law theorists (in section 3.1) and Kant (in\nsection 3.2), might make this point by reminding us of the distinction\nbetween perfect and imperfect duties. Unlike perfect duties, which\nrequire that we take or forego certain actions, the duty to assist\nothers in need is imperfect, in that how, when, and whom we assist is\nnot precisely specifiable and so is within the individual\u2019s\ndiscretion. The general point, on which most of the ancient and modern\nmoralists would agree, is that being helpful cannot be understood in\nisolation from other values, aims, and traits that the individual has.\n(For discussion of how values can be unified, see Wolf 2007.)\n\nOr consider the Milgram experiments. During the experiments, many of\nthe subjects protested even while continuing to obey the\nexperimenter\u2019s commands. In post-experiment interviews with\nsubjects, Milgram noted that many were completely convinced of the\nwrongness of what they were doing. But the presence of conflict need\nnot indicate an absence, or loss, of character. On a traditional\nconception of character, as examined in this entry, many of\nMilgram\u2019s subjects are best described as incontinent. They have\ncharacter, but it is neither virtuous nor vicious. Many of us seem to\nfall into this category. We often recognize what it is right to do but\nwe nevertheless do not do it.\n\nIn short, the objectors say that the situationists rely on a\nsimplified view of character. They assume that behavior is often\nsufficient to indicate the presence of a trait of character, and they\nignore the other psychological aspects of character (both cognitive\nand affective) that, for most of the philosophers discussed in this\nentry, form a more or less consistent and integrated set of beliefs\nand desires. In particular, the objectors say, the situationists\nignore the role of practical deliberation (or, in the case of virtuous\ncharacter, practical wisdom).\n\nFor variations on these replies to the situationists, see Kupperman\n(2001), Kamtekar (2004), Radcliffe (2007), Sabini and Silver (2005),\nSreenivasan (2013), and cf. von Wright (1963,136\u2013154).\n",
