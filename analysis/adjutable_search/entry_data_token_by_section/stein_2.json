    "main_text": "Early Phenomenology || Philosophy of Emotions\n2.2 Philosophy of Emotions\n\nStein\u2019s theory of emotions is propounded in her\nEmpathy-book (esp. 1917: 65\u201372[48\u201354],\n116\u2013124[98\u2013106]) and in the Beitr\u00e4ge (1922:\n21\u201329[21\u201332], 132\u2013138[157\u2013164],\n181[217\u2013218]); see also 1920/2004:\n128\u2013129, 136\u2013140). It represents a complex elaboration of\nthe role that affectivity plays in the constitution of personhood, on\nhow emotions relate to expression, motivation and volition, and how\naffective states of others can be empathically grasped. Accordingly,\nStein\u2019s philosophy of emotions intersects with both her\nphilosophy of psychology and her theory of empathy. While influenced\nby Scheler (esp. 1916/1926), Stein\u2019s account is highly original,\nin particular regarding the analysis of moods and sentiments,\ndifferent levels of affective depth, and a fine-grained elaboration of\nthe \u201cstratification\u201d of the emotive live of persons.\n\nPartly drawing on Scheler, Stein distinguishes five different strata\nof affectivity:\n\n(1) Sensory feelings: On the most basic level, we have\n\u201cfeeling impressions\u201d or \u201csensory feelings\u201d\n(Gef\u00fchlsempfindungen, sinnliche Gef\u00fchle), such as\nitching, bodily pain, or the pleasure of the taste or texture of food\n(1917: 65\u201366[48\u201349]). Stein holds a version of\nintentionalism regarding bodily sensations (Crane 1998, 78\u201388).\nThis is the thesis that pain and other sensory feelings have properly\nspeaking intentional objects and present parts of the body of the\nemoter under certain aspects to her. What is thus intentionally given\nto the emoter as an object, however, is not some\n\u201cpain-object\u201d but its bodily-felt location. Stein\ncharacterizes such sensory feelings also as \u201cbodily localizable\nsensations\u201d (leiblich lokalisierte Empfindnisse; 1917:\n58[42]). Accordingly, the pleasure of a taste or texture is\n\u201cfelt where the food is tasted\u201d or \u201cwhere the piece\nof fabric touches my skin\u201d (1917: 65[48]. Moreover, Stein\nattributes to these low-level feelings an intrinsic relation to the\nself. In sensory feelings, \u201cI experience my affective\nsensitivity (sinnliche Empf\u00e4nglichkeit) as the highest\nand most outer layer of my I\u201d (1917: 118[100]). This concerns\none of the core tenets of Stein\u2019s phenomenology of affectivity:\nDifferent layers of affectivity have different \u201cI-depths\u201d\n(Ichtiefe), or different ways and degrees in which emoters\nare impacted by affective experiences (1917:\n119\u2013124[101\u2013105]).\n\n(2) Common feelings: The next stratum of affectivity is\nall-pervasive. One of the key insights of Stein\u2019s account of\nemotions is that every conscious experience is always penetrated and\nmodulated by affectivity. Famously, Heidegger puts forth an\nexistential-ontological version of this claim, which has also been\nfurther developed in neo-Heideggerian accounts of \u201cexistential\nfeelings\u201d (Ratcliffe 2019). All experiences, including\ncognitions, conations, perceptions, and volitions, are\n\u201ccolored\u201d or \u201clit up\u201d by, or \u201csubmerged\ninto\u201d what Stein calls \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201ccommon\nfeelings\u201d (Gemeingef\u00fchle; e.g., 1917:\n65\u201366[48\u201349], 86[68], 118\u2013119[100\u2013101]; 1922:\n123[145]). They are essentially affective states of the lived\nbody. For example, weariness, freshness or irritability are not\nintentional in the sense that they don\u2019t present or evaluate\nparticular objects, events or persons. But, like sensory feelings,\nthey are in a minimal sense intentional: they relate the emoter to her\nown overall bodily state and thus indicate the emoter\u2019s\n\u201cattunement\u201d (Befindlichkeit), as Heidegger will\nlater call it. Accordingly, Stein aptly characterizes common feelings\n(together with moods) as forms of \u201cself-experiencing\u201d\n(Sich-erlebens) (1917: 118[100]). Moreover, like sensory\nfeelings, common feelings occupy a \u201cJanus-faced position\u201d\n(Zwitterstellung): they are not only \u201cin\u201d my\nlived body, as it were, but also \u201cin me, they emanate out of my\nI\u201d (1917: 65[48\u201349]).\n\n(3) Moods: The third layer of affectivity is constituted by\nmoods (Stimmungen). Like common feelings, they constitute an\nall-pervasive dimension of our affective lives: \n\n\nevery emotional experience bears [a] certain mood-component\n(Stimmungskomponente), in virtue of which emotions emanate\nand expand from their initial place and fill up the Ego. (1917:\n122[104]) \n\n\nThere are two important differences to common feelings, however:\nfirst, moods do not have a \u201cbodily nature\u201d (leiblicher\nNatur), they do not \u201cfill out\u201d the felt body as the\ncommon feeling of sluggishness, say, does; hence a \u201cpurely\nspiritual\u201d being could in principle be subject to moods too\n(1917: 65[49]; note that the English translation wrongly states the\nexact opposite of the German here). Secondly, moods are intentional in\nthe sense that they have an \u201cobjective correlate: for the\ncheerful, the world is submerged into a rosy shimmer\u201d (1917:\n108\u2013109[92]; see also 1922: 181[217]). In line with her theory of\npsychophysical causation (see\n sect. 2.1),\n Stein maintains that there are \u201creciprocal\n\u2018influences\u2019\u201d and interconnections between the\nspiritual and the bodily dimension of affectivity, or between moods\nand common feelings: \n\n\nsuppose I make a recovery trip and arrive at a sunny, pleasant spot,\n[feeling] how a cheerful mood starts to take possession of me, but\ncannot prevail, because I feel sluggish and weary. (1917:\n65\u201366[49]; see also 1922: 65\u201366[75\u201376]) \n\n\nMoods can also interact with proper emotions, for example, I can have\na \u201cserious\u201d or a \u201ccheerful joy\u201d (1917:\n122[104]).\n\n(4) Emotions: \u201cEmotions in the pregnant sense\u201d\n(1917: 119[100]), or \u201cspiritual feelings\u201d (geistige\nGef\u00fchle) (1917: 66[50]), as Stein also calls them, are\nproperly speaking intentional states: \u201c[emotions] are always\nfeelings of something. In every feeling (F\u00fchlen), I am\ndirected at an object\u201d (1917: 119[100]). Stein also concurs with\nwhat is sometimes called the \u201cfoundational thesis\u201d, held\nby Brentano, Husserl or Pf\u00e4nder, according to which emotions are\ngrounded in or derive their intentionality from some presentational or\nrepresentational act (Vorstellung) or cognition (Drummond\n2018: 9ff.). This is the reason why a \u201cpurely feeling subject is\nan impossibility\u201d (1917: 125[107]; see also 1917: 67[50]). On the\nother hand, Stein controversially contends that, just as in the case\nof moods, a \u201cpure spirit\u201d or a \u201cbody-less\nsubject\u201d may become for example frightened, but will not\n\u201close its mind\u201d, as the fear will not exerting any psychic\ncausality. Such a creature will also \u201cfeel pleasure and pain in\nits full depth\u201d, even if \u201cthese emotions don\u2019t exert\nany [bodily] effect\u201d. Spiritual feelings are as a matter of\nfact bodily felt, but considered in their \u201cpure\nessence\u201d \u201cnot body-bound (leibgebunden)\u201d\n(1917: 66\u201367[50]).\n\nAccording to Stein, we must distinguish four affective dimensions with\nregard to proper emotions: \n\ntheir \u201cdepth\u201d (Tiefe), i.e., roughly their\nimpact on the self (for contemporary reassessments, see Pugmire 2005;\nVendrell Ferran 2008, 2015a,b); \ntheir \u201creach\u201d (Reichweite), which is\n\u201ccorrelated to the level of the value\u201d and\n\u201cprescribes the layer, to which it is \u2018sensible\u2019 for\nme to let the emotions penetrate me\u201d (vern\u00fcnftigerweise\neindringen lassen darf). For example, I ought not let my\nannoyance over an overdue piece of news that I\u2019m waiting for\nconsume the attention needed for another task that is actually more\nimportant to me (1917: 122[104]); \ntheir \u201cduration\u201d, i.e., the diachronic extension of an\nemotion in a subject\u2019s experiential stream, which is dependent\nupon the emotion\u2019s depth (ibid.); \nthe \u201cintensity\u201d of an emotion.\n\n\nWhereas the factual intensity of an emotion is not subject to\nthe laws of reason, we can and ought to modulate an\nemotion\u2019s impact on our volitions and behavior: I may very well\nbe completely \u201cfilled out\u201d by an actually mild irritation,\nwhich can also endure overly long, or \u201cfeel a high value less\nintensively as a lower one and hence be enticed to realize the lower\none\u201d. But Stein hastens to add that \u201cbeing\n\u2018enticed\u2019 (\u2018verleitet\u2019) precisely\nimplies that the laws of reason have been violated here\u201d (1917:\n123[105]). .\n\nCrucially, for Stein, emotions can be \u201crationally\u201d\nappropriate, and \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d. What\nmakes emotions subject to rational and normative\ncorrectness-conditions is, once again, their \u201cbeing anchored in\nthe I\u201d. Stein considers someone who is\n\u201c\u2018overcome\u2019 by the loss of his wealth, i.e.,\nimpacted in the core of his I\u201d. The irrationality then consists\nof an \u201cinversion of the hierarchy of values\u201d or even\n\u201ca loss of emotionally sensitive insight (f\u00fchlende\nEinsicht) into higher values and the lack of correlative personal\nlayers\u201d. (1917: 120[101]). Another example is somebody who\nenjoys her aesthetic enjoyment itself more than the disclosed\naesthetic values of an art-piece (1917: 121[102]). Finally, there is\nanother type of inappropriateness that perfectly fits into\nStein\u2019s overall account, but which doesn\u2019t presuppose\nendorsement of the theory of value hierarchy or problematic forms of\nvalue-realism (see below): Thus, some have suggested distinguishing\nthe moral, practical and prudential appropriateness of emotions from\ntheir \u201cfittingness\u201d. Roughly, an emotion E of a\nsubject S is fitting if E\u2019s target has the evaluative\nfeatures which E pertains to affectively present to S\n(d\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2000; cf. Mulligan 2017; De Monticelli\n2020). Put differently, an emotion is fitting, if it picks out\nthose evaluative features of the target that really matter\nto the emoter herself. Fittingness is an essentially\nsubject-relative notion. It doesn\u2019t concern any objective\n(axiological or moral) properties. Consider Stein\u2019s example\nagain: if the loss of wealth really matters to the ruined\nstock-broker, her utter despair will indeed fit, notwithstanding the\nmoral status of speculative money; if she, on the other hand, actually\nhas long hoped that she rids herself of the burden of spending the\nrest of her life in figuring out ways of investing her capital, then\nher utter despair over the loss will be unfitting.\n\n(5) Sentiments: the final layer of affectivity is constituted\nby \u201csentiments\u201d (Gesinnungen) or affective\nattitudes directed toward persons. Stein lists a number of examples,\nsome of which contemporary philosophers typically subsume under\ndifferent classes of affective phenomena, such as love and hatred, or\ngratitude, resentment and vindictiveness. While love or hatred are\nindeed best characterized as sentiments (as did already Pf\u00e4nder\n(1913), who had a strong influence on Stein), gratitude and resentment\nwould today be rather subsumed under the class of reactive attitudes,\nand vindictiveness is better characterized as an affective character\ntrait (Deonna and Teroni 2012: 8\u20139). What unifies this class\nof sentiments, according to Stein, however, is that they are\n\u201cemotions having other persons as their objects\u201d. Like all\nother dimensions of affectivity, they are also \u201canchored on\ndifferent levels of the I (e.g., love deeper than affection)\u201d\nand \u201chave personal values as their correlates\u201d (1917:\n120[101f.]).\n\nIt is an open question whether Stein thinks that all of these five\ndimensions of affectivity are intentionally directed at and disclose\nvalues. Emotions and sentiments are fully-fledged intentional states\ngrasping values, but it is less clear whether sensory feelings and\ncommon feelings or moods (which she also occasionally discusses) do so\ntoo. But what does it mean that emotions \u201cgrasp values\u201d?\nStein concurs with early phenomenological views of the\nepistemic-evaluative function of feelings: Feelings not only have\nevaluative properties of things, persons and state-of-affairs as their\nproper intentional objects; they are our most direct, and indeed best,\naccess to values. It is, however, not clear how to conceive of the\nontological and phenomenological status of values. Stein, like all\nearly phenomenologists, including not only the so-called\n\u201crealist\u201d phenomenologists such as Scheler, Reinach, Stein\nor Hildebrand but also the transcendental-idealist Husserl, hold some\nform of value realism. But again, it is far from clear what\nphenomenological value realism exactly entails, and Stein is rather\nsilent on that issue. The most charitable reading of Stein\u2019s\nrealist theory of values seems to be one that cuts across the\nfollowing alternative: Either values are first constituted by emotive\nacts or they are independent properties of things, persons or events\nthat emotions merely respond to. According to Stein\u2019s middle-way\naccount, though value-properties are but intentional correlates of\nemotions, in having emotions, we can appropriately or inappropriately\ntrack values. Values, thus, retain a certain ontological autonomy\nvis-\u00e0-vis emotive acts, but they are not fully independent from\nthose acts, as it is precisely in having emotions that objects are\nproperly disclosed as valuable.\n\nIn order to understand this position, we must consequently understand\nthe disclosive function of emotions, or what Scheler, Stein and other\nphenomenologists call \u201cvalue-feeling\u201d\n(Wertf\u00fchlen). To begin with, it is crucial not to\nmisunderstand the term \u201cvalue-feeling\u201d by reifying the\nvalues and value-properties of the evaluated objects upon which\nemotions are directed. Furthermore, value-feelings do not\nindependently track values. Just like \u201cemotions in the pregnant\nsense\u201d, they are dependent upon the \u201cknowledge\u201d of\nor an intentional acquaintance with the object to which a certain\nvalue pertains. This knowledge is typically constituted by perception\nor some other intuitive act, such as imagination. Furthermore, a\nvalue-feeling is an affective phenomenon. But it is not a distinct\ntype of affective act or feeling (cf., however, Mulligan 2010a,b,\n2017).\n\nHow, then, are value-feelings and the experience or the feeling of an\nemotion related? Stein\u2019s position is again not unambiguous. We\nfind a few ambivalent passages that are sometimes cited to show that\nshe does not identify value-feelings and feelings (see\nMulligan 2010a: 236; 2017: 235; cf. Vendrell Ferran 2015a). For example, Stein explicitly\ndistinguishes between \u201cvalue-feeling\u201d\n(Wertf\u00fchlen) and \u201cthe feeling of the existence of\na value\u201d as well as between \u201cvalue-emotion\u201d\n(Wertgef\u00fchl) and \u201cthe depth of a feeling\u201d\n(1917: 120[102]). At another central passage, however, Stein claims\nthat \n\n\nattempts to distinguish \u201cfeeling\u201d (F\u00fchlen)\nand \u201cemotion\u201d (Gef\u00fchl) \n\n\nare futile, since they \n\n\ndon\u2019t denote distinct types of experiences, but only different\n\u201cdirections\u201d (Richtungen) of one and the same\nexperience. (1917: 117 [98\u201399]; see also\n116\u2013121[98\u2013103]) \n\n\nThe systematically most plausible interpretation, in any case, is to\nconstrue, with Stein, the phenomenological relation between the felt\nand the evaluative or appraisal function of emotions in terms of a\ndouble-aspect theory (see for a similar account De Monticelli\n2020). According to this, Stein does not contrast the act of\nvalue-feelings with the feeling or the emotional reaction that is\ntriggered by those values; rather, they are just two aspects of the\naffective intentionality of emotions (see 1917:\n116\u2013121[98\u2013103].\n\nAnd yet, Stein doesn\u2019t simply identify the act of\nvalue-feeling and the feeling-state; instead, she distinguishes the\ntwo aspects in order to accommodate cases in which a value is\ndisclosed but precisely doesn\u2019t affectively impact me\n(\u201cleaves me cold\u201d), or doesn\u2019t elicit a\ncorresponding emotion (see 1922: 133\u2013136[159\u2013163]; cf.\nVendrell Ferran 2017). Thus, emotions are disclosing not only\nevaluative properties but also something about the appropriateness and\nthe depth of the felt evaluation, or the emotional experience as such.\nWhen I have a feeling (e.g., joy over x), what is disclosed to me is\nnot only the evaluative property (joyfulness) of x but that\nand how x matters to me or impacts me in a certain\nway (as meriting a joyful response from me). A contemporary equivalent\nof this view can be found in Bennett W. Helm\u2019s account of\nemotions. According to Helm, \n\n\nemotions are evaluative feelings: feelings of evaluative content,\nwhereby import impresses itself upon us. (\u2026) we might also say\nthat emotions are felt evaluations: evaluations that we make\nby feeling them. (Helm 2001: 74) \n\n\nLike for Helm and some other contemporary accounts of affective\nintentionality (e.g., Goldie 2000), Stein conceives of the intentional\nand evaluative component, on the one hand, and the (bodily) feeling\ncomponent, on the other, not as distinct but as inextricably\nintertwined (1917: 117[99]).\n\nEmotions also bear an intrinsic evaluative relation to\noneself and indeed a constitutive relation to one\u2019s\npersonality and personhood. Emotions are essentially self- and\npersonhood-related. To understand this claim, consider how I-depth and\nthe depth of a value-feeling are correlated and how value-feelings\nhave an intrinsic self-evaluative dimension. In an emotional\nexperience, a subject is not only directed upon the evaluative\nfeatures of an object, but also \u201cexperiences herself, the\nfeelings as coming from the \u2018depths of her I\u2019\u201d.\n(1917: 117[98]) This self-experience is not a bare affective awareness\nof ourselves, but of our specific personality: \n\n\nIn emotions, we experience ourselves not only as existing but also as\nbeing such-and-such, the emotions manifest personal characteristics.\n(1917: 117[99]) \n\n\nTo rephrase in Helm\u2019s terminology: Emotions are felt evaluations\nor \u201cfeelings of value\u201d, whereby the import impresses\nitself upon us. But import can only impress itself upon oneself if\nthose values are expressive of one\u2019s concerns or of what is\nimportant for oneself.\n\nBut there is even more to the relation between emotions and the self.\nEmotions not only appraise objects, indicate import for one and\nmanifest our personality\u2014moreover, and by the same token, they\nalways have a self-evaluative dimension. Emotions evaluate me\nas the subject for whom those objects have value. My emotions thus\nalways calibrate and recalibrate my \u201cself-esteem\u201d\n(Selbstwertgef\u00fchl; 1917: 121[103]).\n\nEmotions are also essentially connected to expression, volition and\naction. Emotions \u201cmotivate\u201d both their expression and\nvolition (1917: 68\u201370[51\u201353];\n123\u2013124[104\u2013105]). Stein stresses that there is a\nnecessary relation between feeling and expression, which is not a\n\u201ccausal\u201d but \u201ca nexus of essence and sense\u201d or\n\u201can essential relation and a relation of sense\u201d\n(Wesens- und Sinnzusammenhang) (1917: 70[53]). The relation\nholds even if there is no direct \u201couter\u201d, facial or\nbodily, expression, and the feeling only results in a\n\u201c\u2018cool\u2019 reflection\u201d. How we can then\n\u201csee\u201d, \u201cread\u201d and interpret the emotions of\nothers based on their expressions and actions, is a matter of\nsustained analysis of Stein, developed in her account of empathy.\n",
