    "main_text": "\n\nComputer programs are particular kinds of texts. It is therefore\nnatural to ask what is the meaning of a program or, more generally,\nhow can we set up a formal semantical account of a programming\nlanguage. \n\nThere are many possible answers to such questions, each motivated by\nsome particular aspect of programs. So, for instance, the fact that\nprograms are to be executed on some kind of computing machine gives\nrise to operational semantics, whereas the similarities of programming\nlanguages with the formal languages of mathematical logic have\nmotivated the denotational approach that interprets programs and their\nconstituents by means of set-theoretical models. \n\nEach of these accounts induces its own synonymy relation on the\nphrases of the programming language: in a nutshell, the full\nabstraction property states that the denotational and operational\napproaches define the same relation. This is a benchmark property for\na semantical account of a programming language, and its failure for an\nintuitive denotational account of a simple language based on\nlambda-calculus has led eventually to refinements of the technical\ntools of denotational semantics culminating in game semantics, partly\ninspired by the dialogue games originally used in the semantics of\nintuitionistic logic by Lorenzen and his school, and later extended by\nBlass and others to the interpretation of Girard\u2019s linear logic.\nThis bridge between constructive logic and programming has also\nsuggested stronger forms of relation between semantics and\nproof-theory, of which the notion of full completeness is perhaps the\nmost remarkable instance. \n",
