    "main_text": "John McCarthy and Common Sense Logicism\n2. John McCarthy and Common Sense Logicism[10]\n2.1 Logical AI\n\n\nThe most influential figure in logical AI is John McCarthy. McCarthy\nwas one of the founders of AI, and consistently advocated a research\nmethodology that uses logical techniques to formalize the reasoning\nproblems that AI needs to solve. All but the most recent work in\nMcCarthy\u2019s research program can be found in\n Lifschitz 1990a,\n which also contains an\nintroduction to McCarthy\u2019s work\n Lifschitz 1990b;\n for additional historical background, see\n Israel 1991.\n\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s methodological position has not changed substantially\nsince it was first articulated in\n McCarthy 1959\n and elaborated and amended\nin\n McCarthy & Hayes 1969.\n The motivation for using logic is that\u2014even if the\neventual implementations do not directly and simply use logical\nreasoning techniques like theorem proving\u2014a logical formalization\nhelps us to understand the reasoning problem itself. The claim is that\nwithout an understanding of what the reasoning problems are, it will\nnot be possible to implement their solutions. Plausible as this\nPlatonic argument may seem, it is in fact controversial in the context\nof AI; an alternative methodology would seek to learn or evolve the\ndesired behaviors. The representations and reasoning that this\nmethodology would produce might well be too complex to characterize or\nto understand at a conceptual level.\n\n\nFrom\n McCarthy & Hayes 1969,\n it is clear that McCarthy thought of his methodology for AI as\noverlapping to a large extent with traditional philosophy, but adding\nto it the need to inform the design of programs capable of manifesting\ngeneral intelligence. This idea is not uncongenial to some philosophers\n(see, for instance,\n Carnap 1956\n(pp.\u00a0244\u2013247) and\n Pollock 1995).\n In\npractice, the actual theories that have emerged from McCarthy\u2019s\nmethodology are influenced most strongly by work in philosophical\nlogic, and the research tradition in logical AI represents a more or\nless direct development of this work, with some changes in emphasis.\nThis review will concentrate on logical AI in relation to philosophical\nlogic, without further comment on relations to philosophy in general or\nto the feasibility of developing human-level intelligent systems.\n2.2 The Formalization of Common Sense\n\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s long-term objective was to formalize common sense\nreasoning, the prescientific reasoning that is used in dealing\nwith everyday problems. An early example of such a problem, mentioned\nin\n McCarthy 1959,\n is getting from\nhome to the airport. Other examples include:\n\nNarrative understanding. The reasoning involved in\nreconstructing implicit information from narratives, such as sequencing\nof eventualities, and inferred causal connections.\nDiagnosis. For instance, detecting faults in physical\ndevices.\nSpatial Reasoning. For instance, reasoning about the parts\nof rigid bodies and their shapes, and their relation to the shape of\nthe whole.\nReasoning about the attitudes of other agents. For\ninstance, making informed guesses about the beliefs and desires of\nother agents, not from \u201ckeyhole observation\u201d but from conversational\nclues of the sort that could be obtained in a brief, interactive\ninterview.\n\n\n\nStated baldly, the goal of formalizing common sense would probably\nseem outrageous to most philosophers, who are trained to think of\ncommon sense as rather elusive. But whether or not the ultimate goal\nis appropriate and achievable, the specific formalization projects\nthat have emerged from this program have been successful in several\nways.  They have succeeded in breaking new territory for logic by\nextending the scope of the reasoning problems to which logical\ntechniques can be successfully applied. They have demonstrated that\nlogical techniques can contribute usefully to the solution of specific\nAI problems\u2014planning is the most successful of these, but some\nsuccess has been achieved in other areas as\nwell.[11] They\nform the basis of one approach to developing complete, autonomous\nagents.[12] And\nthey have illuminated many specific forms of nonscientific\nreasoning\u2014for instance, qualitative reasoning about the behavior\nof physical devices.[13]\n Although McCarthy has advocated this program of formalization\nsince 1959\u2014an almost prehistorical date for AI\u2014the program has\nnot been taken on board and pursued by a dedicated community until\nrecently.  Research in this area has gained much momentum since 1990.\nFor further discussion and details, see \n Section 8.\n",
