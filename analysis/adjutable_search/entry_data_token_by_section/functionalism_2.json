    "main_text": "Antecedents of Functionalism || Early Antecedents\n2.1 Early Antecedents\n\nThe earliest view in the Western canon that can be considered an\nancestor of functionalism is Aristotle\u2019s theory of the soul (350\nBCE). In contrast to Plato\u2019s claim that the soul can exist apart\nfrom the body, Aristotle argued (De Anima Bk. II, Ch. 1) that\nthe (human) soul is the form of a natural, organized human\nbody \u2013 the set of powers or capacities that enable it to express\nits \u201cessential whatness\u201d, which for Aristotle is a matter\nof fulfilling the function or purpose that defines it as the kind of\nthing it is. Just as the form of an axe is whatever enables it to cut,\nand the form of an eye is whatever enables it to see, the (human) soul\nis to be identified with whichever powers and capacities enable a\nnatural, organized human body to fulfill its defining function, which,\naccording to Aristotle, is to survive and flourish as a living,\nacting, perceiving, and reasoning being. So, Aristotle argues, the\nsoul is inseparable from the body, and comprises whichever capacities\nare required for a body to live, perceive, reason, and act. (See\nShields, 1990, and Nelson, 1990, for further debate about whether\nAristotle\u2019s view can be considered to be a version of\nfunctionalism.)\n\nA second, relatively early, ancestor of contemporary functionalism is\nHobbes\u2019s (1651) account of reasoning as a kind of computation\nthat proceeds by mechanistic principles comparable to the rules of\narithmetic. Reasoning, he argues, is \u201cnothing but\nreckoning, that is adding and subtracting, of the\nconsequences of general names agreed upon for the marking and\nsignifying of our thoughts.\u201d (Leviathan, Ch.\n5) In addition, Hobbes suggests that reasoning \u2013 along with\nimagining, sensing, and deliberating about action, all of which\nproceed according to mechanistic principles \u2013 can be performed\nby systems of various physical types. As he puts it in his\nIntroduction to Leviathan, where he likens a commonwealth to\nan individual human, \u201cwhy may we not say that all automata\n(engines that move themselves by springs and wheels\u2026) have an\nartificial life? For what is the heart but a spring; and the nerves\nbut so many strings, and the joints but so many wheels\u2026\u201d.\nIt was not until the middle of the 20th century, however, that it\nbecame common to speculate that thinking may be nothing more than\nrule-governed computation that can be carried out by creatures of\nvarious physical types.\n",
