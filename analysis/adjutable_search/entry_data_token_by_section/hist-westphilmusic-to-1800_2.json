    "main_text": "Antiquity || Mathematical and Empirical Harmonics\n1.2 Mathematical and Empirical Harmonics\n\n\u2018Harmonics\u2019 is the Ancient Greek discipline that studied\nmusical entities, from intervals to scalar systems (Barker 1990: 3).\nThe Pythagorean tradition marked the start of an influential approach\nto harmonics, focused on the definition of musical entities in\nmathematical terms. Early contributors to this approach were Philolaus\nof Croton (c. 470\u2013c. 385 BCE) and especially Archytas of\nTarentum, a contemporary of Plato (Huffman 1993, 2005).\n\nA mathematical treatment of harmonics informed by Pythagorean\nprinciples is also given in the Sectio Canonis, a treatise of\ndebated authorship, but often attributed to Euclid. Nicomachus (fl. c.\n100 CE) wrote an influential introduction to harmonics from the\nPythagorean standpoint (source texts with commentary are collected in\nBarker 1990; Barker 2007 reconstructs the development of Pythagorean\nharmonics.)\n\nParallel to the Pythagorean tradition, an alternative approach sought\nto ground the laws of music in the way it appears to a competent\nlistener, rather than in explanations from other domains of knowledge.\nThis tradition attempted to provide descriptions of music in\nautonomously musical terms, and valued accordance with musical\npractice. This empirical approach to harmonics is in contrast\nto the mathematical approach adopted by the Pythagorean\nschool (on the differences between the two schools, see Barker 2007\nand Barker 1990: 3\u20138). The contrast between these two schools is\nof philosophical interest, insofar as it concerns the appropriate\nlevel of explanation for aesthetic phenomena. Additionally,\nmathematical harmonics often were taken to support the metaphysical\nworldview associated with the Pythagorean doctrine, whereas empirical\nharmonics tended to follow from an Aristotelian framework (see Barker\n2007: chapter 4; Mathiesen 1999: 303).\n\nBy far the most important figure in the empirical tradition is that of\nAristoxenus (see\n \u00a71.4),\n although he relied on the work of previous theorists (Barker 2007:\nchapter 2). The mathematical and empirical traditions are often\nreferred to as Pythagorean and Aristoxenian, respectively.\n\nTheophrastus (c. 371\u2013287 BCE), who followed Aristotle as the\nhead of the Lyceum, is critical of the Pythagorean approach. He\nobserves that we may find quantitative regularities in things other\nthan musical intervals, yet we still consider these things as\ndifferent from musical entities. This, he argues, must be due to the\nfact that intervals and melodies are essentially something other than\nnumbers (Barker 1990: 111\u2013114; Lippman 1964: 157\u2013160;\nBarker 2007: chapter 15).\n\nIt is important to stress that the contrast between empirical and\nmathematical approaches was already evident to ancient theorists and\ncommentators, who often passionately took sides. Ptolemais of Cyrene\n(fl. between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century CE), the only\nknown Greek woman music theorist, distinguishes between\nmousikoi and kanonikoi, a distinction that matches\nthe one between Aristoxenians and Pythagoreans (Barker 2014: 185).\n\nSome theorists developed hybrid views. Ptolemy (c. 100\u2014c. 170\nCE) is a case in point, as he explicitly faults both Pythagorean and\nAristoxenian approaches (Harmonics, book I, 2). His\nphilosophical outlook is clearly Pythagorean. For instance, he defends\nat length the notion of cosmic harmony, tracing parallels between\nmusical and cosmological entities (Harmonics, book III, 9).\nHowever, he attempts to develop mathematical constructs that are\nbetter adherent to musical practice than the ones proposed by\nPythagoreans, thus addressing a concern characteristic of the\nAristoxenian approach.\n\nAristides Quintilianus (3rd\u20134th century CE), an author known\nuniquely for his treatise De Musica, also attempts a fusion\nof Aristoxenian and Pythagorean elements. While his view of harmonics\nis indebted to Aristoxenus, his philosophy of music bears a strong\nPythagorean influence. Book III of his De Musica illustrates\nparallels between musical elements and the most disparate parts of\nreality, from the senses, to virtues, all the way to celestial bodies.\nAristides Quintilianus defends the ethical value of music, and in\ndoing so he explicitly refers to Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\nviews on the issue. He argues that music imitates moral actions in a\nway that is superior to that of the other arts, because it achieves\nmimesis in more than one way, that is, through words and\nmelodic movement (De Musica, book II, chapter 4). Aristides\nQuintilianus also classifies musical elements, from modes to\ninstruments, as masculine, feminine, or a mixture of the two (modes\nare scales that divide up the octave in different sequences of tones\nand semitones; though the names of Greek modes are identical to the\nlater Church modes, they name different scales). This classification\nis supposed to help in determining the ethos of musical pieces and\ninstruments, feminine elements being associated with smoothness, and\nmasculine ones with roughness (De Musica, book II, chapter\n12).\n",
