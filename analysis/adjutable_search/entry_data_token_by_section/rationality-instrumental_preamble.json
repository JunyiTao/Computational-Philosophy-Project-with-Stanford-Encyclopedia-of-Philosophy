    "main_text": "\n\nSomeone displays instrumental rationality insofar as she adopts\nsuitable means to her ends. Instrumental rationality, by virtually any\nreckoning, is an important, and presumably indispensable, part of\npractical rationality. However, philosophers have been interested in\nit for further reasons. To take one example, it has been suggested\nthat instrumental rationality, or some tendency toward it, is partly\nconstitutive of intention, desire, or action. To take another, more\nimportant, example, it has been argued that instrumental rationality\nis not only a part, but a special part, or even the whole, of\npractical rationality. This thesis appears to threaten the\n\u201crational authority\u201d of morality. It seems possible that\nacting morally on some occasion might not be a suitable means to an\nagent\u2019s ends. If so, then according to this thesis, it would not\nbe irrational for her to refuse to act morally on such an\noccasion.\n\nWe should note two restrictions on the scope of this article. First,\nthis article focuses on contemporary discussions of the subject, apart\nfrom some brief discussions of Hume and Kant. Notable omissions, for\nexample, are Aristotle\u2019s discussion of the practical syllogism\nand his claim that deliberation is of means (Nicomachean\nEthics, Book III, Chapter 3).\n\nSecond, this article doesn\u2019t focus on decision theory, which\nsome may view as containing, or just being, a theory of instrumental\nrationality: what means to take to achieve certain ends (the\nsatisfaction of preferences, or the realization of valuable states of\naffairs) given credences, or beliefs, or information, about the\nprobabilities that various means will achieve those ends. In this\narticle, we begin\n (\u00a71)\n by noting a distinction that frames the discussion that follows: very\nroughly, a distinction between the question of whether some attitude\nis such that an agent ought, or (more weakly) has reason, to have it,\nand the question of whether that attitude rationally coheres with her\nother attitudes. We first\n (\u00a72)\n discuss the importance of means-end relations for what one ought, or\nhas reason, to intend: specifically, for how reasons for ends\n\u201ctransmit\u201d to reasons for means. We then\n (\u00a73)\n discuss instrumental rationality understood as a norm of rational\ncoherence. Lastly, we consider\n (\u00a74)\n the \u201cHumean\u201d thesis that instrumental rationality is the\nonly kind of practical rationality.\n",
