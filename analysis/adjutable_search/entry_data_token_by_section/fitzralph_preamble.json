    "main_text": "\nRichard FitzRalph (1299\u20131360) was regarded even during his\nlifetime as one of the leading thinkers to emerge from that generation\nof exceptionally talented thinkers who emerged at Oxford in the early\n1330s. Although his later fame was mainly due to his polemical\nwritings, especially regarding the poverty question and his attacks on\nthe Franciscans, he was acknowledged as a significant interlocutor by\nthinkers such as Holcot, Wodeham, Wyclif and Gregory of Rimini among\nothers.  Although regarded as somewhat traditional in his doctrinal\ntendencies, he was particularly well-regarded for the careful and\ndetailed re-formulation of the arguments of thinkers such as Aquinas,\nHenry of Ghent and Duns Scotus, especially on matters such as\ninfinity, future contingents and the relation of the will to the\nintellect.  His was the first book by an Irishman to be printed (as an\nincunabulum) and consequently, for example, his theory of dominion was\nstill being discussed in the sixteenth century.\n",
