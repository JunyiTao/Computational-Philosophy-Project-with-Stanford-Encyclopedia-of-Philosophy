Animal Cognition Applied to Philosophy\n\nThe science of animal behavior and cognition is increasingly being\nused to provide premises in philosophical arguments. What follows is\nan extremely brief gesture toward several areas of philosophy that\nhave benefited from recent attention to the sciences of animal mind\nand behavior.\n\nBefore we begin, we should point out two potential obstacles with this\nproject. It\u2019s important to note that the use of animal cognition\nresearch in philosophy must be handled carefully, given the\nmethodological considerations discussed in\n section 2.\n Sometimes philosophers seek to show that animals have a property\nbecause they have a capacity, but the way the capacity was\noperationalized in the study is different from how the philosopher\nunderstands it. While many of the terms used in comparative cognition\nare familiar, they may be defined differently, which can lead to\nconfusion and misunderstanding.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the relationship between a\ntheory and a claim about an animal having or lacking a psychological\nproperty is a tight one. Sometimes philosophers are both arguing for a\ntheory and for a claim that an animal has a particular property; such\nprojects might be defended as cohesive, or they might be critiqued as\nquestion-begging.\n\nKeeping these obstacles in mind, in this section, we will have a look\nat how the evidence coming from the science has influenced and shaped\ndifferent philosophical debates.\n",
