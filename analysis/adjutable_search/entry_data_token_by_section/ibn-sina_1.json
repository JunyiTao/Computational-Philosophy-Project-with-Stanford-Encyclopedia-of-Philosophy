    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\nDespite his peregrinatory life spent in historically turbulent times and areas, including the frequently unfavorable personal circumstances in which he found himself (as recounted in the Autobiography and Biography, Gohlman 1974), Avicenna was terribly productive, even by the standards of the highly prolific authors writing in Arabic in medieval Islam. In the Autobiography he says that by the time he was eighteen he had mastered all subjects in philosophy without anything new having come to him since (Gohlman 1974, 30\u201339). Even though the Autobiography has particular philosophical points to make (discussed in the next section), this is no mere boast. There are reports that he wrote major portions of his greatest work, The Cure, without any books to consult (Gohlman 1974, 58; transl. and analysis Gutas 2014a, 109\u2013115), that he composed in a single night, dusk to dawn, a treatise on logic in one hundred quarto (large size) pages (Gohlman 1974, 76\u201381), and that he compiled The Salvation (GS 6) \u201cen route\u201d\u2014on horseback, manifestly, or during rests from riding\u2014in the course of a military expedition in which he had accompanied his master, \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be-ad-Dawla (Gohlman 1974, 66\u201367). Exaggerated and hagiographic as some of these reports might be, it is clear that Avicenna had constructively internalized (not to say \u201cmemorized\u201d) the philosophical curriculum and he could reproduce it, properly assimilated and analytically reconstructed, at will. This is also evident in his disregard (rather than neglect?) for keeping copies of his works; as it must have happened rather frequently, when commissioned or asked to write about a subject that he had treated earlier, it was apparently just as easy for him to compose a treatise anew as it was to copy an earlier version of it. Avicenna could write fast and with great precision, sacrificing nothing in analytical depth. At the same time, however, given his undisputed fame and immense intellectual authority that he exercised soon after his death, pseudepigraphy became a major factor multiplying the works attributed to him (Reisman 2004 and 2010). Accordingly, some medieval bibliographies of his works (and some modern ones, based on the former) list close to three hundred titles, though a recent sober tally of them brings the authentic writings down to fewer than one hundred, ranging from essays of a few pages to multi-volume sets, and flags the pseudepigraphs that need to be assessed and authenticated (Gutas 2014a, Appendix, 387\u2013540). Much work still remains to be done in this regard.\n\nAvicenna wrote in different genres, but his major innovation was the development of the summa philosophiae, a comprehensive work that included all parts of philosophy as classified in the late antique Alexandrian and early Islamic tradition (cited above). This was due as much to his own philosophical training, which followed this curriculum, as to the earliest commissions he received while still in Bukhara for works that would encompass all philosophy; but then these commissions inevitably reflect the broad philosophical culture of the period that viewed science and philosophy as an integral whole. Already in his very first philosophical treatise, Compendium on the Soul, which Avicenna dedicated to the Samanid ruler, as noted above, he presented the theoretical knowledge (the intelligible forms) to be acquired by the rational soul precisely as classified in the philosophical curriculum (Gutas 2014a, 6\u20138), and with his second work, the Philosophy commissioned by \u02bfAr\u016b\u1e0d\u012b, he fleshed out this outline into the first scholastic philosophical compendium or summa. He went on to write seven more such summae in his career, ranging in length from a sixty-page booklet (Elements of Philosophy, \u02bfUy\u016bn al-\u1e25ikma, GS 3), written earlier in his career, to the monumental The Cure (al-Shif\u0101\u02be), in his middle period. It runs to twenty-two large volumes in the Cairo edition (1952\u201383), and its contents exhibit all the parts of philosophy in the Aristotelian tradition which they reproduce, revise, adjust, expand, and re-present, as follows:\n\nLogic\n  \nEisagoge (Porphyry\u2019s Eisagoge)\nCategories (Aristotle\u2019s Categories)\nOn interpretation (Aristotle\u2019s De interpretatione)\nSyllogism (Aristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics)\nDemonstration (Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics)\nDialectic (Aristotle\u2019s Topics)\nSophistics (Aristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations)\nRhetoric (Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric)\nPoetics (Aristotle\u2019s Poetics).\n\nTheoretical Philosophy\n  \nPhysics\n    \nOn nature (Aristotle\u2019s Physics)\nOn the heavens (Aristotle\u2019s De caelo)\nOn coming to be and passing away (Aristotle\u2019s De generatione et corruptione)\nMineralogy (Aristotle\u2019s Meteorology IV)\nMeteorology (Aristotle\u2019s Meteorology I\u2013III)\nOn the soul (Aristotle\u2019s De anima)\nBotany (De plantis by Nicolaus of Damascus)\nZoology (Aristotle\u2019s History, Parts, and Generation of Animals)\n\nMathematics\n    \nGeometry (Euclid\u2019s Elements)\nArithmetic (Nicomachus of Gerasa, Diophantus, Euclid, Th\u0101bit b. Qurra, and others)\nMusic (mostly Ptolemy\u2019s Harmonics with other material)\nAstronomy (Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest)\n\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t / Metaphysics\n    \nUniversal Science: the study of being as being, first philosophy, natural theology (Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics)\nMetaphysics of the Rational Soul (phenomena of religious and paranormal life studied as functions of the rational soul)\n\n\nPractical Philosophy\n  \nProphetic legislation as the basis for the three parts of practical philosophy\nPolitics (prescriptions by the prophet legislator for public administration and political ruler to succeed him; [Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s books on politics])\nHousehold management (prescriptions of the prophet legislator for family law; [Bryson\u2019s Oikonomikos and related books by others])\nEthics (as legislated by a caliph; [Aristotle\u2019s \n Nicomachean Ethics])[4]\n\n\n\nAvicenna did not treat all of these subjects in each one of his summae, but he varied their contents and emphasis depending on the specific purpose for which he composed them. He developed a style of supple Arabic expository prose, complete with technical philosophical terminology, that remained standard thenceforth. After The Cure, he was asked to write a brief exposition of the philosophical subjects, which he did by collecting and putting together\u2014at times even splicing together\u2014material from his earlier writings and produced The Salvation (al-Naj\u0101t). He did the same, in Persian this time, for his patron the Kakuyid \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be-ad-Dawla, the Philosophy for \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be (D\u0101neshn\u0101me-ye \u02bfAl\u0101\u02be\u012b, GS 7). In both of these books he left out the mathematical sciences and the subjects of practical philosophy, only the former of which was later supplemented by J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, first in Arabic and then in Persian, on the basis of earlier writings by Avicenna.\n\nToward the end of his life Avicenna wrote two more summae in slightly divergent modes. In one of them, which he called Eastern Philosophy (al-Mashriqiyy\u016bn or al-\u1e24ikma al-mashriqiyya, GS 8) to reflect his own locality in the East of the Islamic world, broader Khurasan (mashriq), he concentrated on \u201cmatters about which researchers have disagreed\u201d in logic, physics, and metaphysics, but not mathematics or the subjects of practical philosophy (except for prophetic legislation which he introduced; see below) insofar as there was little disagreement about them. His approach is doctrinal, not historical, presenting, as he says, \u201cthe fundamental elements of true philosophy which was discovered by someone who examined a lot, reflected long,\u201d and had nearly perfect syllogistic prowess, namely, himself (GS 8, p. 2 and 4; transl. and analysis Gutas 2014a, 35\u201340; Gutas 2000). In the second, also his very last summa, he diverged even more drastically from traditional modes of presentation and developed an allusive and suggestive style which he called \u201cpointers and reminders\u201d (al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t wa-l-tanb\u012bh\u0101t, GS 9). The purpose in this, for which he borrowed the topos of late antique Aristotelian commentarial tradition explaining why Aristotle had developed a cryptic style of writing, was to train the student by providing not whole arguments and fully articulated theories but only pointers and reminders to them which the student would complete himself. The book, in two parts, deals with logic in the first and with physics, metaphysics, and metaphysics of the rational soul in the second. It proved hugely popular as a succinct though frequently amphibolous statement of his mature philosophy, open to interpretation, and it became the object of repeated commentaries throughout the centuries, apparently as Avicenna must have intended. It is a difficult work, and it must be understood always through constant reference to the more explicit expository statement of Avicenna\u2019s theories in The Cure. Traditionally it has rarely been read except together with a commentary, notably those of Fakhr-ad-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b and especially Na\u1e63\u012br-ad-D\u012bn \n al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b.[5]\n\nOther than in the summae, Avicenna wrote comprehensively on all philosophy in two major and massive works, both in about twenty volumes, both now lost. The first was his youthful commentary on the works of Aristotle which he wrote upon commission by his neighbor Baraq\u012b, mentioned above, The Available and the Valid [of Philosophy]. The second, Fair Judgment (GS 11), composed in 1029, was a detailed commentary on the \u201cdifficult passages\u201d of the entire Aristotelian corpus, in which was included even the suspect Theology of Aristotle (actually Plotinus\u2019 Enneads IV\u2013VI). The title refers to Avicenna\u2019s adjudication between traditional Aristotelian exegeses and Avicenna\u2019s own views by presenting arguments in support of the latter. As Avicenna explains his title, \u201cI divided [in the book] scholars into two groups, the Westerners [the Greek commentarial tradition and the Baghdad Aristotelians] and the Easterners [Avicenna\u2019s positions], and I had the Easterners argue against the Westerners until I intervened to judge fairly when there was a real point of dispute between them\u201d (GS 14, 375; transl. Gutas 2014a, 145). The book was unfortunately lost during some military rout, and only the commentary on Book Lambda, 6\u201310, of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics survives (GS 11a; Geoffroy et al. 2014), along with two incomplete recensions of his commentary on the Theology of Aristotle (GS 11b; Vajda 1951). Some marginal notes on De anima, surviving independently as transcribed in a manuscript, have the same approach and manifestly belong to the same period and project (GS 11c; Gutas 2004b).\n\nIndependent treatises on individual subjects written by Avicenna deal with most subjects, but especially with those for which there was greater demand by his sponsors and in which he was particularly interested, notably logic, the soul, and the metaphysics of the rational soul. In an effort to reach a wider audience, he expressed his theories on the rational soul in two allegories, Alive, Son of Awake (\u1e24ayy b. Yaq\u1e93\u0101n, GM 7; Goichon 1959) and The Bird (GM 8; Heath 1990), and he versified still others: The Divine Pearl (al-Jum\u0101na al-il\u0101hiyya) on the oneness of God and the emanated creation in 334 verses (GM 9), The Science of Logic, in verse, in 290 lines (GL 4), and a number of poems on medical subjects, notably his Medicine, in verse, in 1326 lines (GMed 27), which was commented upon by Averroes. In addition, he engaged in protracted correspondence with scholars who asked or questioned him about specific problems;  noteworthy are his Answers to Questions Posed by B\u012br\u016bn\u012b [GP 8], the other scientific genius of his time, on Aristotelian physics and cosmology, and especially the two posthumous compilations of his responses and discussions circulating under the titles Notes (GS 12a) and Discussions (GS 14). He also wrote what amounts to open letters depicting the controversies in which he was involved and seeking arbitration or repudiating calumniatory charges against him (GPW 1\u20133).\n\nAvicenna lived his philosophy, and his desire to communicate it beyond what his personal circumstances required, as an intellectual in the public eye, is manifest in the various compositional styles and different registers of language that he used. He wrote with the purpose of reaching all layers of (literate) society, but also with an eye to posterity. His reach was as global in its aspirations as his system was all-encompassing in its comprehensiveness; and history bore him out. \n",
