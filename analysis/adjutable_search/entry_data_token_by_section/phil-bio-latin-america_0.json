A Brief Discussion on Philosophy of Biology\n\nWe will begin with a few words about philosophy of biology before\ndiving into a more detailed discussion. As in all regions, there are\nmany ways of working within philosophy of biology in Latin America.\nVarious authors (Griffiths 2008 [2018]; Odenbaugh & Griffiths\n2020; and Kitcher 2005) have identified four distinct kinds of\nphilosophical inquiry that fall under the general heading of\nphilosophy of biology, and we could add a fifth.\n\nFirst, there is the reassessment of some problems, theses, and\nsolutions developed in general philosophy of science or in other\nspecial philosophy of science, within the context of biology. Second,\nwe have the analysis of logical, semantic, pragmatic, epistemological,\nmethodological, ontological, praxiological, axiological, ethical, and\naesthetic aspects of biology. Third, specific conceptual problems in\nbiology are analyzed philosophically. Fourth, biology, or its\nphilosophical analysis, contributes to the development of new\napproaches and answers to traditional philosophical questions (e.g.,\nthe topic of abortion in ethics, or evolutionary epistemology and\nnaturalized epistemologies). Fifth, ethical and social implications of\nbiological knowledge and the technological applications of biology are\nanalyzed.\n\nEthics and epistemology in general, mentioned in the\nfourth kind of philosophy of biology above, constitute specific areas\nin themselves. As such, they have their own philosophical\nsub-communities, as well as conferences, journals, and associations,\nand deserve a specific and separate treatment beyond this entry. In\nthe fifth kind of doing philosophy of biology, analysis of the ethical\nand social implications of biological knowledge takes place\nwithin bioethics, and analysis of the ethical and social\nimplications of technological applications of biological\nknowledge takes place within philosophy of technology in general\nand philosophy of biotechnology in particular. Therefore,\nalthough we will mention them, these ways of working within philosophy\nof biology will not be discussed in detail here.\n\nWith regards to the first type of philosophy of biology, it is\nimportant to mention that science makes philosophical presuppositions\nof different kinds. Moreover, in the presentation of results,\nempirical scientists use a variety of types of languages: the\ntechnical language of the science in question, natural language(s),\nthe language(s) of logic(s) and mathematics, and a language to talk\nabout science. The first three types of languages could be called\nscientific-language-in-use. This is different from what might\nbe called metascientific-language-in-use, that is,\nexpressions used to talk about science, such as scientific\n\u201cconcepts\u201d, \u201chypotheses\u201d, \u201claws\u201d,\n\u201cmodels\u201d, \u201ctheories\u201d, or\n\u201cmechanisms\u201d. The precision and clarification of concepts\nis called conceptual analysis or explication (Carnap 1950)\nand constitutes a fundamental task for philosophers. The explication\nof scientific and meta-scientific concepts may be carried out by\nphilosophers of science and by scientists themselves. Though generally\nscientists explicate meta-scientific concepts in a more introductory\nand informal manner.\n\nThe re-ordering, or reconstruction, of the conceptual systems\nproduced by science is also carried out by trained philosophers and\nscientists themselves. Regarding issues of foundations or of\ntheoretical science, studies executed by philosophers of science and\nby scientists may coincide, with results published in journals or\nbooks either in the field of philosophy or science. And what holds\ntrue for science in general also holds true for biology in particular.\nThe scope of this entry allows us to consider only a few of the most\nsignificant of these attempts.\n\nFinally, philosophy of biology can also be subdivided according to the\nparticular areas of biology with which it is concerned (Griffiths 2008\n[2018]; Odenbaugh & Griffiths 2020). Biology contains a diverse\nset of sub-disciplines, including evolution, systematics, genetics,\nand ecology. Each area produces its own philosophical challenges,\nwhich could be linked to any of the aforementioned ways of working\nwithin philosophy of biology. The following review considers all these\nareas, including some related disciplines such as biochemistry and\nbiomedical sciences.\n",
