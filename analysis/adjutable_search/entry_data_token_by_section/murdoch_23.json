    "main_text": "Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals || Duty\n15.1 Duty\n\nIt is not possible to provide a full discussion of Metaphysics as\na Guide to Morals in this entry, nor of Murdoch\u2019s evolving\nviews on art and literature, religion, politics, concepts, and the\nnature of philosophy, all of which bear on her view of morality. When\nMetaphysics treats issues of morality, most of what it says\nis in the spirit of her earlier moral writings, or extends it, though\nsometimes quite significantly. There is a great deal more emphasis in\nMetaphysics on purification of the individual\nconsciousness\u2014purifying it of its egoism\u2014and the Platonic\n\u201cascent\u201d to that purification, as a core moral task; but\nthat idea is present in Sovereignty also. She also much more\nfrequently connects morality with mysticism, spirituality, and\nreligion. She also retains the idea that we construct our moral world\nthrough mental activity, but in Metaphysics she sometimes\nshifts that activity from attention to Eros, or energy (\u201c[W]e\nare always deploying and directing our energy, refining or\nblunting it, purifying or corrupting it\u201d. [MGM 1992: 495;\nemphasis in original]), and sometimes to imagination (MGM 1992:\n322).\n\nHowever, in Metaphysics Murdoch amends her moral philosophy\nin one quite substantial way. She now thinks the moral life cannot do\nwithout duty, and that duty is not simply an expression of moral\nvision or attention. She says that there are several different\n\u201cmodes of ethical being\u201d besides moral\nvision/attention/Eros/purification, that co-exist with it in a larger\n\u201cfield of force\u201d, involving tension between the different\nmodes (MGM 1992: 492). Duty is the most important of these. Her\nconception of duty is like Kant\u2019s in certain respects and\ncontrary to it in others.\n\nDuties, as Kant said, present absolute moral requirements. They are\navailable as a bridle on contrary inclination without being routed\nthrough the individual\u2019s moral sensibility. They can thereby\n\u201cintroduce order and calmness\u201d (MGM 1992: 494). They do\nnot leave room for flexibility of interpretation by the agent\u2019s\nmoral character (Hopwood 2019: 250).\n\nBut, contra Kant, duties are unsystematic, not necessarily connected\nwith one another. The reason for not lying is different from that for\nnot stealing. They are not all expressions of a more general principle\nor procedure, like the categorical imperative. Murdoch recognizes but\nrejects Schopenhauer\u2019s and Wittgenstein\u2019s view that\n\u201cduty\u201d, especially when viewed (as Murdoch does), as an\nunconnected \u201clist\u201d, is a holdover from a theological view\n\u201cas arbitrary orders given by God\u201d (MGM 1992: 301f,\n303).\n\nMurdoch is aware that this conception of duty applies more fully to\n\u201cnegative duties\u201d than positive ones.\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t lie\u2019 is a clearer command\nthan \u2018be truthful\u2019\u201d (MGM 1992: 302). However,\nalthough the latter does not have the clarity of direction of the\nformer, both possess an immediate availability to the agent.\n\nMurdoch also rejects Kant\u2019s view that duty is the whole of\nmorality, as she rejects Schopenhauer\u2019s view that morality can\nrest solely on compassion and eschew duty (MGM 1992: 292).\nPurification of consciousness remains the \u201cfundamental\n\u2018arena\u2019\u201d of morality (MGM 1992: 293). The\n\u201cdutiful man\u201d may be \u201ccontent with too\nlittle\u201d, following a rule without imagining that more is\nrequired (MGM 1992: 494), more that must arise from another mode of\nethical being.\n\nMurdoch recognizes something like dutiful action in\nSovereignty, when she speaks of everyday acts that we perform\nsimply as any moral agent, and for publicly obvious reasons [IP:\n43/334]. But there she does not frame these actions as\n\u201cduty\u201d as she develops that notion in MGM, but as\nexpressions of moral perception. In Sovereignty she lacks the\nidea that \u201cthe concept of duty remains with us as a steady moral\nforce\u201d (MGM 1992: 494).\n",
