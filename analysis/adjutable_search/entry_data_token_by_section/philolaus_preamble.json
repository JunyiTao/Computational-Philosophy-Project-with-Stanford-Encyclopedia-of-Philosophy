    "main_text": "\n\nPhilolaus of Croton, in southern Italy, was a Greek\nphilosopher/scientist, who lived from ca. 470 to ca. 385 BC and was\nthus a contemporary of Socrates. He is one of the three most prominent\nfigures in the Pythagorean tradition, born a hundred years after\nPythagoras himself and fifty years before Archytas. He wrote one book,\nOn Nature, which was probably the first book to be written by\na Pythagorean. There has been considerable controversy concerning the\n20+ fragments which have been preserved in Philolaus\u2019 name. It is now\ngenerally accepted that some eleven of the fragments come from his\ngenuine book. Other books were forged in Philolaus\u2019 name at a later\ndate, and the remaining fragments come from these spurious works.\nPhilolaus argues that the cosmos and everything in it are made up of\ntwo basic types of things, limiters and unlimiteds. Unlimiteds are\ncontinua undefined by any structure or quantity; they include the\ntraditional Presocratic material elements such as earth, air, fire and\nwater but also space and time. Limiters set limits in such unlimiteds\nand include shapes and other structural principles. Limiters and\nunlimiteds are not combined in a haphazard way but are subject to a\n\u201cfitting together\u201d or \u201charmonia,\u201d which can be\ndescribed mathematically. Philolaus\u2019 primary example of such a\nharmonia of limiters and unlimiteds is a musical scale, in which the\ncontinuum of sound is limited according to whole number ratios, so\nthat the octave, fifth, and fourth are defined by the ratios 2 : 1, 3\n: 2 and 4 : 3, respectively. Since the whole world is structured\naccording to number, we only gain knowledge of the world insofar as we\ngrasp these numbers. The cosmos comes to be when the unlimited fire is\nfitted together with the center of the cosmic sphere (a limiter) to\nbecome the central fire. Philolaus was the precursor of Copernicus in\nmoving the earth from the center of the cosmos and making it a planet,\nbut in Philolaus\u2019 system it does not orbit the sun but rather the\ncentral fire. The astronomical system is a significant attempt to try\nto explain the phenomena but also has mythic and religious\nsignificance. Philolaus presented a medical theory in which there was\na clear analogy between the birth of a human being and the birth of\nthe cosmos. The embryo is conceived of as composed of the hot and then\nas drawing in cooling breath immediately upon birth, just as the\ncosmos begins with the heat of the central fire, which then draws in\nbreath along with void and time from the unlimited. Philolaus posited\na strict hierarchy of psychic faculties, which allows him to\ndistinguish human beings from animals and plants. He probably believed\nthat the transmigrating soul was a harmonious arrangement of physical\nelements located in the heart and that the body became ensouled when\nthe proper balance of hot and cold was established by the breathing of\nthe new-born infant. Philolaus\u2019 genuine book was one of the major\nsources for Aristotle\u2019s account of Pythagorean philosophy. There is\ncontroversy as to whether or not Aristotle\u2019s description of the\nPythagoreans as equating things with numbers is an accurate account of\nPhilolaus\u2019 view. Plato mentions Philolaus in the Phaedo and\nadapts Philolaus\u2019 metaphysical scheme for his own purposes in the\nPhilebus.\n",
