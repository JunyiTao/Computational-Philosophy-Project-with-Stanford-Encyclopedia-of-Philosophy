    "main_text": "The Morality and Rationality of Suicide || Suicide, Virtue, and Life\u2019s Meaning\n4. Conclusion\n\nAs the foregoing discussion indicates, suicide has been and continues\nto be a rich field of philosophical investigation. Recent advances in\nmedical technology are responsible for the extensive philosophical\nattention paid to one kind of suicide, euthanasia or\nphysician-assisted suicide (PAS), while more\n\u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d suicide motivated by psychological\nanguish is somewhat overlooked. This is somewhat unfortunate:\nEuthanasia and physician-assisted suicide raise issues beyond those\nassociated with other suicides, including the allocation of health\ncare resources, the nature of the medical profession, the\npatient-physician relationship, and the prospect that allowing\nrelatively benign forms of killing such as voluntary euthanasia of PAS\nwill lead down a \u201cslippery slope\u201d to more morally\nworrisome killings. However, many of the same issues and concerns that\nsurround PAS and euthanasia also surround run-of-the mill suicide, and\nmany writers who address the former often disregard the vast\nliterature on the latter. (In addition to the entry on voluntary\neuthanasia, Dworkin et al. 1998, Barry 2007, Pabst Battin\n2003, and Cholbi 2011, 139\u201361, provide overviews of the moral\ndebates surrounding euthanasia and PAS.)\n\nNot only is suicide worthy of philosophical investigation in its own\nright, it is a source of insight for various philosophical\nsubdisciplines: moral psychology, ethical theory, social and political\nphilosophy, the metaphysics of personhood, and action theory. Suicide\nis also an area where philosophical interests intersect with those of\nthe empirical sciences. The collective efforts of philosophers and\nothers continue to illuminate one of the most enigmatic of human\nbehaviors.\n",
