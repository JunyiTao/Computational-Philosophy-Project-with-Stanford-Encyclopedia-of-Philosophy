    "main_text": "Beyond Individual Memory || Collective memory\n8.2 Collective memory\n\nIn addition to the growing literature on the ways in which\ntechnological resources contribute to remembering, there is a large\nand dynamic literature on the ways in which groups remember together.\nOr rather there are two distinct literatures here, one concerning\nsmall-scale groups, the other concerning large-scale\ngroups. The former has been investigated primarily in psychology,\nexemplified by studies of remembering in married couples (Harris,\nBarnier, Sutton, & Keil 2014) or in mother-child dyads\n(Reese, Haden, & Fivush 1993). The latter has been\ninvestigated primarily in the social sciences and history, where, in what\nhas been termed a \u201cmemory boom\u201d\n(Blight 2009), an enormous amount of work on\nhow nations and similar entities remember their pasts has appeared in\nrecent years. One question of philosophical interest in this general\narea is the relationship between memory in small-scale groups and\nmemory in large-scale groups. There is increasing interaction between\nthe two literatures (Bietti & Sutton 2015; Fagin,\nYamashiro, & Hirst 2013; Roediger\n& Abel 2015), and it may turn out that\nsimilar processes of remembering unfold in both small-scale and\nlarge-scale groups. But small-scale and large-scale collective memory,\nas we will see, do appear to raise somewhat different issues, and it\nmay turn out not to be a contingent matter that they have for the most\npart been studied in different disciplines.\n8.2.1 Memory in small-scale groups\n\nThe central question concerning memory in small-scale groups is\nperhaps whether such groups manifest emergent, robustly\ncollective forms of memory. A range of views on this question are\navailable (Barnier, Sutton, Harris, & Wilson 2008;\nWilson 2005), but the conservative view is certainly that, while remembering\nmay be affected by the social context in which it occurs, it is itself always\na strictly individual-level process. The conservative view is the\nnatural starting point, but there is a surprisingly good case to be\nmade for the radical view that remembering is sometimes a group-level\nprocess. A promising place to look for robustly collective forms of\nmemory is in transactive memory systems (Wegner 1987):\nstable, ongoing groups characterized by a division of responsibility\nfor remembering and a shared metacognitive awareness of that division\n(Kirchhoff 2016; Theiner, Allen, & Goldstone 2010;\nTollefsen, Dale, & Paxton 2013). Drawing on\nWimsatt\u2019s (1986) notion of\nemergence, for example, Theiner (2013) has provided a rigorous\nargument for the view that transactive memory systems manifest a form\nof emergent memory, in the sense that the group has a memory capacity\nof its own, over and above those of its individual members. Drawing on\na somewhat different theoretical framework, Huebner (2013, 2016) has\ndeveloped a complementary approach. Thus, while the question remains\nopen, the conservative view may no longer be the obvious starting\npoint.\n8.2.2 Memory in large-scale groups\n\nThe central question concerning memory in large-scale groups is\nwhether such groups are capable of remembering in anything like the\nsense in which individuals are capable of remembering. Applying\nconcepts developed in the domain of individual memory to the domain of\nsmall-scale collective memory may already be problematic; applying\nthem to the domain of large-scale collective memory may be more\nproblematic still. Anastasio et al. (2012), for example, have argued\nthat the concept of consolidation (referring to the process\nthrough which unstable, short-term memory representations are\ntransformed into stable, long-term memory representations) applies\nboth at the level of individuals and at the level of societies, but\nthis argument may overlook the disanalogies between internal and\nexternal memory noted above. Similarly, Tanesini (forthcoming) has\nargued that the concept of amnesia (referring to the\ninability of an agent to retrieve memories that would normally be\nretrievable) applies both at the level of individuals and at the level\nof societies, but there is little evidence that patterns of\nremembering and forgetting at the social level correspond particularly\nclosely to patterns at the individual level. Along the same general\nlines, Szpunar and Szpunar (2016; cf. Merck, Topcu, &\nHirst (2016)) have argued that the concept of episodic future\nthought (introduced above) applies both at the level of\nindividuals and at the level of societies, but it is unclear whether\nsocieties are able to imagine their futures in ways analogous to those\nin which individuals imagine their futures.\n\nGeneral concepts and theories developed in other areas of social\nontology have the potential to shed further light on collective\nmemory. For example, the literature on\ncollective intentionality\n(Tollefsen 2006), may clarify the activity of joint reminiscing, which\nmight be understood as a form of joint attention to the past (Hoerl\n& McCormack 2005; Seemann forthcoming).\nBy providing a novel test case, collective memory also\nhas the potential to shed light on general concepts and theories in\nsocial ontology. For example, Smith (2014) has pointed out that,\nwhereas many social objects (institutions, contracts, and the like)\nare continuants, in the sense that they endure over time, the speech\nacts which, on many accounts, ground their existence, are events and\nhence exist only at a given moment in time. It is unclear how events\nmight ground the existence of continuants, and one potential solution\nto this problem is to ground the existence of social objects not in\nspeech acts but rather in forms of external memory, which are\nthemselves continuants (Ferraris [2010] 2013, 2015).\n9. The Epistemology of Memory\n\nIn addition to their implications for the metaphysics of memory,\nexternal and collective memory may have novel implications for\nepistemology (Carter & Kallestrup 2016; Clark 2015;\nMichaelian & Arango-Mu\u00f1oz\nforthcoming). Most research on the epistemology of memory, however,\nreflects the traditional concerns of individual epistemology, including\nthe viability with respect to memory knowledge of broad families of\nepistemological theories, such as internalism and externalism (Madison 2017),\nand of particular theories within those families, such as foundationalism\n(Senor 1993), coherentism (Olsson & Shogenji 2004),\nand reliabilism and virtue epistemology (Shanton 2011), as well as the\nrelevance to memory of issues such as scepticism (Baldwin 2001; Moon 2017)\nand epistemic circularity (Alston 1986). Other research on the epistemology of\nmemory tackles concerns specific to memory. As Frise (2015, Other\nInternet Resources) points out, there are unresolved debates over the\nproblem of forgotten evidence (Harman 1986), the problem of forgotten\ndefeat (A.I. Goldman 1999), and the problem of stored beliefs (Moon\n2012). There are also ongoing debates over the alleged analogy between\ntestimony and memory (Barnett 2015; Dummett 1994)\nand the question whether memory is a generative or a merely\npreservative source of knowledge (Frise forthcoming; Lackey 2005;\nMatthen 2010; Salvaggio forthcoming). Issues in the\nepistemology of memory, of course, interact with issues in the\nmetaphysics of memory, but, as there is\na separate entry on the epistemology\nof memory, these interactions will not be explored here in any detail.\n10. The Ethics of Memory\n\nThe ethics of memory is a relatively new area, but research in this\narea already concerns a number of distinct questions.\n10.1 Memory and moral responsibility\n\nThe research on remembering as mental time travel introduced above\nemphasizes the relationship between episodic memory and its\nfuture-oriented counterpart, episodic future thought, and there are\npotential links between mental time travel and moral\nresponsibility. Levy (2014; cf. Vierra 2016), for example, has\nargued that deficits in episodic memory and episodic future thought in\npsychopathy (Kennett & Matthews 2009; McIlwain 2010)\nimply that psychopaths cannot genuinely intend to harm others and that they\ntherefore may not have full moral responsibility for their actions.\nCraver et al. (2016), however, argue that subjects with deficits in\nepisodic memory and episodic future thought make moral judgements\nsimilar to those made by normal subjects, suggesting that more work\nneeds to be done to establish a definitive link between mental time\ntravel and moral responsibility.\n10.2 The duty to remember\n\nSome researchers have argued that we may have a moral duty to\nremember. Margalit (2002), for example, argues that we have a\nduty to remember the victims of radical evil. Such an\nobligation\u2014which, as Blustein (2008) points out,\nmight hold either at the individual or the collective\nlevel\u2014would be consistent with the spirit behind\ntruth and reconciliation commissions and similar institutions (Neumann\n& Thompson 2015). But the existence of a duty to\nremember is controversial, with some maintaining that there is no general\nduty to remember the past and even that there may in some cases be a duty\nto forget (Rieff 2016).\n10.3 The right to be forgotten\n\nOur increasing reliance on novel forms of external memory, may have\nsurprising ethical ramifications. The default for human memory is to\nforget, and most of the information that we encounter never makes its\nway into long-term memory. The default for computer memory, in\ncontrast, is to remember, and researchers are beginning to explore the\nethical implications of moving from a state of affairs in which\nforgetting is the norm, in the sense that one\u2019s\nwords and deeds would in general leave few permanent traces, to one in which\nremembering is the norm, in the sense that many of our words and deeds\nleave behind more or less permanent digital traces\n(Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger 2009). When remembering is the norm, people\nmay, in particular, be deprived of any opportunity for a fresh start\nafter engaging in inappropriate behaviours, leading some to argue for\na right to be forgotten (Ghezzi, Pereira, &\nVesnic-Alujevic 2014; J. Rosen 2012). From a legal and technological\npoint of view, such a right is likely to be difficult to implement.\nFrom a moral point of view, a right to be forgotten may imply a duty\nto forget, and it is unclear whether we can plausibly be held to have\nsuch a duty (Matheson 2013).\n10.4 The ethics of external memory\n\nNovel external memory technologies may ultimately reshape the norms\ngoverning individual remembering (Burkell 2016; O\u2019Hara 2013),\nbut even in the short term there are pressing ethical questions\nrelated to the impact of external memory technologies on\ncognition and the self. Regarding cognition, some have, as noted in\nsection 8, voiced unease about the cognitive impact of increasingly\nprevalent use of such technologies (Carr 2010). Others, however, are more\noptimistic (Bell & Gemmell 2009), and assessing the empirical\nevidence for optimistic and pessimistic claims about the cognitive\nimpact of external memory technologies is no easy matter (Heersmink\n2016; Loh & Kanai 2016). Regarding the self, Heersmink (2015,\nforthcoming) has argued that an extended mind perspective implies that there are\nstrict ethical constraints against interfering with individuals\u2019\nexternal memories (cf. N. Levy 2007). Clowes (2013, 2015), however,\nhas raised the possibility that the fact that internet-connected forms\nof external memory are often strongly influenced by agents other than\nthe individuals to whom they belong means that they do not count as\nparts of the relevant individuals\u2019 minds.\n10.5 The ethics of memory modification and enhancement\n\nWith the emergence of new techniques for altering the functioning of\nmemory systems\u2014for example, retrieval of a stored memory results\nin a period of reconsolidation during which the retrieved memory is\nlabile and susceptible to modification, potentially allowing\ninterventions to alter traumatic memories (Spiers & Bendor\n2014)\u2014ethical questions concerning various forms of memory\nmodification have become more pressing (Erler 2011; Hui &\nFisher 2015; N. Levy 2012; Liao & Wasserman 2007). Liao and\nSandberg (2008) identify a number of questions raised by memory\nmodification technologies; in light of the close relationship between\nmemory and the self noted above, it is no surprise that many of these\nconcern the effects of memory modification on the self. Modifying\nsomeone\u2019s memories may, for example, limit his self-knowledge by\ndepriving him of opportunities to learn about his own actions or erode\nhis sense of agency by depriving him of the possibility of viewing\nhimself as an agent with respect to events in which he was involved.\nNevertheless, Liao and Sandberg argue that, in certain cases, the\nbenefits of memory modification may outweigh its costs, so that there\nneed be no general ethical barrier to the use of emerging memory\nmodification technologies. Much of the debate so far has focussed on\nthe suppression of traumatic or otherwise undesirable memories, but\nparallel questions are raised by the use of novel methods for the\nenhancement of memory abilities by pharmaceutical and other\nmeans (Bostrom & Sandberg 2009). Critics of the memory\nenhancement debate, however, have argued that the evidence for the efficacy of\nthe relevant methods is mixed (Zohny 2015) or that the debate often\noverlooks important differences among kinds of memory (Fox, Fitz,\n& Reiner forthcoming).",
