    "main_text": "Challenging the Concept of Indirect Discrimination || Is Indirect Discrimination Really Discrimination?\n3.1 Is Indirect Discrimination Really Discrimination?\n\n\nYoung argues that the concept of discrimination should be limited to\n\u201cintentional and explicitly formulated policies of exclusion or\npreference.\u201d She holds that conceiving of discrimination in\nterms of the consequences or impact of an act, rather than in terms of\nits intent, \u201cconfuses issues\u201d by conflating discrimination\nwith oppression. Discrimination is a matter of the intentional conduct\nof particular agents. Oppression is a matter of the outcomes routinely\ngenerated by \u201cthe structural and institutional framework\u201d\nof society (1990: 196).\n\n\nCavanagh holds a position similar to Young\u2019s, writing that\npersons \u201cwho are concerned primarily with how things like race\nand sex show up in the overall distributions [of jobs] have no\nbusiness saying that their position has anything to do with\ndiscrimination. It is not discrimination they object to, but its\neffects; and these effects can equally be brought about by other\ncauses\u201d (2002: 199). On Cavanagh\u2019s view, then, if one finds it\ninherently objectionable for political officeholders to be\npredominantly male, then one can sensibly charge that such a\ndisproportion is unjust but cannot coherently claim that it is, in\nitself, discriminatory.\n\n\nAlong the same lines, Eidelson contends that\n\u201c\u2018indirect\u2019 discrimination is not usefully thought\nof as a distinct form of discrimination at all, except as a piece of\nlegal jargon\u201d (2015: 19).  He writes, \u201cPrecisely because\nthe connotation of \u2018discrimination\u2019 as an act \u2026 in\nwhich an agent is sensitive to some feature of the discriminatee, and\nengages in some manner of differential treatment, is inescapable,\ndescribing indirect discrimination as discrimination is a serious\nobstacle to clear communication\u201d (56).\n\n\nThe arguments of Cavanagh, Eidelson and Young raise a question that is not easy\nto answer, viz., why can indirect and direct discrimination be\nlegitimately considered as two subcategories of one and the same\nconcept? In other words, what do the two supposed forms of\ndiscrimination really have in common that make them forms of the same\ntype of moral wrong? Direct discrimination is essentially a\nmatter of the reasons or motives that guide the act or policy of a\nparticular agent, while indirect discrimination is not about such\nreasons or motives. Even conceding that acts or policies of\neach type can be wrong, it is unclear that the two types are each\nspecies of one and the same kind of moral wrong, i.e., the wrong of\ndiscrimination. And if cases of direct discrimination are\nparadigmatic examples of discrimination, then a serious question arises\nas to whether the concept of discrimination properly applies to the\npolicies, rules, and acts that are characterized as\n\u201cindirect\u201d discrimination.\n\n\nMoreover, there is a crucial ambiguity in how discrimination is\nunderstood that lends itself to conflating direct discrimination with\nthe phenomena picked out by \u2018indirect\ndiscrimination\u2019. Direct discrimination involves the\nimposition of disadvantages \u201cbased on\u201d or \u201con account\nof\u201d or \u201cbecause of\u201d membership in some salient social\ngroup. Yet, these phrases can refer either to a) the reasons that\nguide the acts of agents or to b) factors that do not guide agents but\ndo help explain why the disadvantageous outcomes of certain acts and\npolicies fall disproportionately on certain salient groups (Cf. Shin\n2010). In the Roma case, the disadvantage was \u201cbecause\nof\u201d ethnicity in the former sense: the ethnicity of the\nRoma was a consideration that guided the acts of the bar owner and\nbartender. In the Griggs case, the disadvantage was\n\u201cbecause of race\u201d in the latter sense: race did not\nguide the acts of the company but neither was it an accident that the\ndisadvantages of the written test fell disproportionately on\nblacks. Rather, race, in conjunction with the historical\nfacts about North Carolina\u2019s educational policies, explained why\nthe disadvantage fell disproportionately on black employees.\n\n\nThe thought that the policy of the company in Griggs is a kind of\ndiscrimination, viz., indirect discrimination, seems to trade on the\nambiguity in the meanings of the locutions \u2018based on\u2019,\n\u2018because of\u2019, \u2018on account of\u2019, and so on.\nThe state of North Carolina\u2019s policy of racial segregation in\neducation imposed disadvantages based on/because of/on account of race,\nin one sense of those terms. The company\u2019s policy of using\na written test imposed disadvantages based on/because of/on account of\nrace, in a different sense. Even conceding that both the state\nand the company wronged blacks on the basis of their race, it appears\nthat the two cases present two different kinds of wrong.\n\nNonetheless, the idea of indirect discrimination can help to highlight\nhow the wrongful harms of direct discrimination are capable of\nramifying via acts and policies that are not directly discriminatory\nand would be entirely innocent but for the link between them and acts\nof direct discrimination.  In the Griggs case, direct discrimination\nhad harmed blacks by putting them at an educational disadvantage.\nEven if the direct discrimination had ceased at some prior point, the\npolicy of the company enabled the educational disadvantage to branch\ninto an employment disadvantage, thereby amplifying and perpetuating\nthe wrongful harms of the original direct discrimination.  The\nlanguage of indirect discrimination can spotlight the link between the\ntwo forms of disadvantage and capture the idea that the wrongful harms\nof direct discrimination should not be allowed to extend willy-nilly\nacross time and domains of life via otherwise innocent acts. \n\nHowever, it is also true that the idea of indirect discrimination is\ntypically understood in a broader way that does not require any\nconnection to direct discrimination.  Accordingly, in his discussion\nof how persons adhering to certain religious beliefs or practices\nmight be put at an unjust disadvantage by an employer\u2019s dress\ncode, Jones writes, \u201cIndirect discrimination law aims \u2026\nto eliminate inequalities of opportunity arising from religion or\nbelief\u201d (170).  For example, if a code excludes a form of dress\nthat persons adhering to a particular religion regard as\ntheologically-favored, such as head coverings or veils, then the\nBritish law of indirect discrimination requires that the company grant\nan exemption to those persons, unless it can show that the code is a\nproportionate means for achieving a legitimate aim.  On Jones\u2019s\nview, the law thereby counters, albeit in a limited way, an unjust\nburden placed on certain religious adherents and promotes equal\nemployment opportunity.\n\nThe critics of the idea of indirect discrimination think that Jones is\nconflating distinct wrongs: the right of equal opportunity can be\nviolated by discrimination, but it can also be violated by other sorts\nof wrongs.  Even if certain dress codes violate the right and do so in\na way that tracks a particular religious identity, it does not follow\nthat the codes are cases of wrongful discrimination.  But Jones can\nrespond that, as long as the wrongful treatment tracks salient social\ncategories, differentially disadvantaging persons belonging to such a\ncategory, then characterizing the treatment as discrimination is in\norder.\n\n\nStill, critics will contend that the concept of indirect\ndiscrimination is problematic, because its use mistakenly presupposes\nthat the wrongfulness of discrimination can lie ultimately in its\neffects on social groups. Certainly, bad effects can be\nbrought about by discriminatory processes, but critics argue that the\nwrongfulness lies in what brings about the effects, i.e., in the\nunfairness or injustice of those acts or policies that generate the\neffects, and does not reside in the effects themselves. Addressing\nthis argument requires a closer examination of why discrimination is\nwrong, the topic of section 4. Before turning to that section, it\nwould be helpful to address a suspicion that might arise in the course\nof pondering whether indirect discrimination really is a form of\ndiscrimination.\n",
