Sometimes, one ignores\nthe internal mechanisms of a game altogether, merely viewing it as a\nblack box social mechanisms where players control outcomes to a\ncertain extent. In this perspective, a player can force the\noutcome of the game to be in some set X if she commands a\nstrategy that ensures the game to end up in an outcome of X, no\nmatter what the other players do (van der Hoek\n& Pauly 2007). Similarly, a player can force that some\nproposition \\(\\varphi\\) holds if she has the power to enforce that the\ngame ends in a \\(\\varphi\\) state. The collection of all sets of\noutcomes an agent can force are often called her forcing\npowers. In classical game theory, these forcing powers sometimes\ngo by the name of effectivity functions (Peleg\n1997), which are often also studied for\ncoalitions of players (see Pauly 2001; Goranko,\nJamroga, & Turrini 2013; and the entry on\n logics for analyzing power in normal form games).\n\nExample Powers in extensive games.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nNotably, forcing powers are not closed under conjunction. In the game\nabove, agent A can force p and q individually\nwithout being able to force \\(p \\land q\\). In modal logic terms,\nforcing powers give rise to a neighborhood logic (Pacuit\n2017), where the neighborhood\nfunctions list the set of outcomes players can enforce from a given\nstate. Reasoning about forcing powers can then employ a logical\nlanguage with forcing modalities \\(\\{i\\}\\) for each player:\n\n\n\\(\\{i\\}\\varphi\\): agent i can force the outcome of the game to\nsatisfy \\(\\varphi\\). \n\n\nThese modalities can be interpreted over the extended game forms with\nneighborhood functions described above. On the semantic side, a\ngeneralization of the above neighborhood models support a generalized\nnotion of power bisimulation, see van\nBenthem, Pacuit, and Roy (2011).\n\nThe modal logic of powers allows to reason about games at a global\nlevel of description. The modal logic of neighborhood models validates\nthe standard modal monotonicity principle \n\\[\\{i\\}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\{i\\}(\\varphi\\lor\\psi),\\]\n\n\nas follows already from the truth definition of forcing modalities.\nHowever, as forcing powers are not closed under intersection, the\naggregation law fails: \n\\[(\\{i\\}\\varphi\\land\\{i\\}\\psi)\\not\\rightarrow\\{i\\}(\\varphi\\land\\psi).\\]\n\n\nInstead, the logic contains new valid principles relating forcing\nmodalities for different players. For instance, if i can force\nthe truth of \\(\\varphi\\), then no other player j can force its\nfalsity. Thus, \n\\[\\{i\\}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\neg\\{j\\}\\neg\\varphi\\]\n\n\nis a valid principle of \u2018consistency of powers\u2019 in the\nlogic of forcing powers. The converse of this principle for games with\ntwo players \\(i, j\\) \n\\[\\neg\\{j\\}\\neg\\varphi \\rightarrow \\{i\\}\\varphi\\]\n\n\nexpresses the notion of determinacy from the last section. This\nformula is not generally valid, but is an axiom for the special class\nof determined games.\n\nFinally, there also is an alternative, more algebraic perspective on\npowers, assuming an earlier-mentioned perspective of logic games. The\ntwo games depicted in the core example of\n Section 2.2\n may be seen as evaluation games for propositional formulas\n\n\\[p \\land  (q \\lor r) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (p \\land q) \\lor (p \\land r).\\]\n\n\nTheir equivalence qua powers, described earlier, then matches\nthe standard propositional law of distribution. This algebraic\nperspective will return in\n Section 2.9.\n\nMore recent views of forcing and powers re-interpret the sets X\nof outcomes employed in the above definitions as referring to both\nplayers: one player restricts the total set of outcomes, while the\nother players can achieve all outcomes within that set. This balance\nbetween constraint and freedom significantly impacts the corresponding\nnotions of game equivalence, as well as the modal languages used (van\nBenthem, Bezhanishvili, & Enqvist\n2019b).\n\n\n",
