    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language\n2. Philosophy of Language\n\nSince the topics of language and human psychology are central to\nSchleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics and theory of translation, it is\nappropriate to begin with some discussion of his philosophies of\nlanguage and mind. Schleiermacher nowhere presents his philosophy of\nlanguage separately; instead, it is found scattered through such works\nas his lectures on psychology, dialectics, and hermeneutics. The\nfollowing eight positions\u2014all but the last of which are heavily\nindebted to Herder\u2014are especially worth noting:\n\nIn his lectures on psychology, Schleiermacher takes the\nfollowing position on the question of the origin of language\n(virtually identical to Herder\u2019s position in the Treatise on\nthe Origin of Language [1772]): The origin of language is not to\nbe explained in terms of a divine source. Nor is it to be explained in\nterms of the primitive expression of feelings. Rather, the use of\ninner language is simply fundamental to human nature. It is the\nfoundation of, and indeed identical with, thought. It is also the\nfoundation of other distinctively human mental characteristics, in\nparticular self-consciousness and a clear distinguishing of perception\nfrom feeling and desire.\nLanguage (and hence thought) is fundamentally social in\nnature. More precisely, while inner language is not dependent on a\nsocial stimulus (so that even in the absence of this children would\ndevelop their own languages), it does already involve a tendency or an\nimplicit directedness toward social communication.\nLanguage and thought are not merely additions over and\nabove other mental processes that human beings share with the animals.\nRather, they are infused throughout, and lend a distinctive character\nto, all human mental processes. In particular, they structure human\nbeings\u2019 sensory images in distinctive ways.\n\n\nThe next five of the eight positions are especially important for\nSchleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics and theory of translation (to be\ndiscussed below):\n\nSchleiermacher already in early work postulated an\nidentity of thought with linguistic expression. He often equates\nthought more specifically with inner language (e.g., he\nalready does so in his 1812\u201313 lectures on ethics). His main\nmotive behind this refinement can be seen from the lectures on\npsychology, where he discusses cases in which thought occurs without\narriving at any outward linguistic expression. It has been claimed by\nsome of the secondary literature that he eventually gave up this whole\nposition (e.g., by Heinz Kimmerle). He does seem to retreat from it\nsomewhat, but in his psychology lectures of 1830 we still find him\nwriting of \u201cthe activity of thought in its identity with\nlanguage\u201d (SW 3/6: 263).\nSchleiermacher adopts a view of meaning that equates\nit\u2014not with such items, in principle independent of language, as\nthe referents involved (Augustine), Platonic forms, or the subjective\nmental \u201cideas\u201d favored by the British Empiricists and\nothers, but instead\u2014with word-usage, or rules for the use of\nwords. For example, in the hermeneutics lectures he says that\n\u201cthe \u2026 meaning of a term is to be derived from the unity\nof the word-sphere and from the rules governing the presupposition of\nthis unity\u201d (HHM 50).\nIn his psychology lectures, Schleiermacher argues that\nalthough thought and conceptualization are not reducible to\nsensuous images (since that would conflict with the position that the\nformer require, or are indeed identical with, language), the latter\nare an essential foundation for the former. This position is\nalso reflected in his strong attraction, in some of his later\nhermeneutics and dialectics lectures, to Kant\u2019s theory of\nempirical schemata\u2014according to which empirical concepts are\ngrounded, or consist, in unconscious rules for the generation of\nsensuous images\u2014and to turning this into an account of the\nnature of all concepts. (This prompts the question whether there do\nnot also exist strictly a priori concepts, as Kant had held. In his\npsychology lectures Schleiermacher vacillates in his answer to this\nquestion: sometimes implying yes, but at other points instead\nimplying\u2014more consistently with the position just\ndescribed\u2014that it is merely the case that some concepts are\nmore distantly abstracted from sensory images than others.\nThe latter is his normal answer in the dialectics lectures as\nwell.)\nHuman beings exhibit, not only significant linguistic\nand conceptual-intellectual similarities, but also striking linguistic\nand conceptual-intellectual differences, especially between different\nhistorical periods and cultures, but even to some extent between\nindividuals within a single period and culture. (In this connection,\nSchleiermacher argues, plausibly, that the phenomenon of the\nlinguistic and conceptual-intellectual development of cultures over\ntime can only be explained in terms of linguistic and\nconceptual-intellectual innovations performed by individuals, which\nthen get taken over by the broader culture, becoming part of its\ncommon stock.)\nImportantly, Schleiermacher develops a much more\nholistic conception of meaning than his predecessors had held\n(this is the one major respect in which his philosophy of language\ngoes beyond Herder\u2019s). At least three aspects of his semantic\nholism can be distinguished: (a) As can already be seen from a passage\nquoted earlier, he espouses a doctrine of \u201cthe unity of the\nword-sphere\u201d. This doctrine in effect says that the various\nspecific senses that a single word typically bears, and which will\nnormally be distinguished by any good dictionary entry (e.g., the\ndifferent senses of \u201cimpression\u201d in \u201cHe made an\nimpression in the clay\u201d, \u201cMy impression is that he is\nreluctant\u201d, and \u201cHe made a big impression at the\nparty\u201d), always in fact form a larger semantic unity to which\nthey each essentially belong (so that any loss, addition, or\nalteration among them entails an alteration in each of them, albeit\nperhaps a subtle one). (b) He holds that the nature of any particular\nconcept is partly defined by its relations to a \u201csystem of\nconcepts\u201d. In this connection, the dialectics lectures emphasize\na concept\u2019s relations as a species-concept to superordinate\ngenus-concepts, relations as a genus-concept to subordinate\nspecies-concepts, and relations of contrast to coordinate concepts\nfalling under the same genus-concepts. However, other types of\nconceptual relationships would no doubt be included here as well\n(e.g., those between \u201cto work\u201d, \u201cworker\u201d, and\n\u201ca work\u201d or those between physis and\nnomos). (c) He holds that the distinctive nature of a\nlanguage\u2019s grammatical system (e.g., its system of\ndeclensions) is also partly constitutive of the character of the\nconcepts expressed within it. (This last position was also developed\nat around the same period by Friedrich Schlegel, for whom it\nconstituted one of the main rationales for a new discipline of\n\u201ccomparative grammar\u201d that he introduced in his On the\nLanguage and Wisdom of the Indians [1808]. Shortly afterwards, it\nwas taken over and used to similar effect by another of the founders\nof modern linguistics, Wilhelm von Humboldt.) Among these aspects, (b)\nis especially noteworthy as a distinctive contribution of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s; it had been overlooked not only by Herder but\nalso by Friedrich Schlegel, and it constitutes the origin of the\ntwentieth-century theory of the \u201csemantic field\u201d.\n\n\nAs was mentioned earlier, with the sole exception of this final\nfeature (semantic holism), Schleiermacher\u2019s entire philosophy of\nlanguage is heavily indebted to Herder. However, while it refines\nHerder\u2019s philosophy of language with this final feature, it also\nweakens it in other respects. For example, whereas Herder\u2019s\nversion of doctrine\n (4)\n normally restricted itself to a claim that thought is essentially\ndependent on and bounded by language, Schleiermacher\u2019s version\nasserts the outright identity of thought with language, or\nwith inner language. But even in the latter, more cautious version,\nsuch a strong form of the doctrine is philosophically\nproblematic\u2014vulnerable to counterexamples in which thought\noccurs without any corresponding (inner) language use, and vice versa.\nAgain, as we noted, in later works Schleiermacher tends to add to the\nHerderian doctrine\n (5)\n a thesis that concepts are empirical schemata \u00e0 la Kant (see\n (6)).\n This is likely to seem problematic to modern readers because of its\ninclusion of sensory images in meaning. But that is arguably not so:\nHerder had already included them in a way as well; contrary to first\nappearances, doing so need not conflict with a suitably interpreted\ndoctrine that meanings are word-usages; and the currently popular\nrejection of such \u201cpsychologism\u201d in modern philosophy of\nlanguage influenced by Frege and Wittgenstein, which is likely to make\nsuch a position seem suspect, may well itself be misguided. What\nis problematic about Schleiermacher\u2019s thesis is rather\nthat Kant\u2019s theory of empirical schemata had implied that there\nis a sharp distinction between meanings, which he conceived as\nsomething purely psychological, and word-usages, so that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s unmodified reintroduction of the theory implies\nthe same, and hence conflicts with doctrine\n (5),\n the doctrine that meaning is word-usage. Finally, whereas for Herder\ndoctrine\n (7)\n was merely an empirically established rule of thumb and admitted of\nexceptions, Schleiermacher in his lectures on ethics and dialectics\nattempts to give a sort of a priori proof of linguistic and\nconceptual-intellectual diversity even at the level of individuals as\na universal fact\u2014a proof that is dubious in its very a\npriori status, in its specific details, and in its extremely\ncounterintuitive implication (often explicitly asserted by\nSchleiermacher) that, strictly speaking, no one can ever understand\nanother person.\n",
