Anscombe deployed some of the conceptual\nmachinery she had developed in the philosophy of action to topics in\nthe philosophy of sense-perception. Three relevant theses from the\nphilosophy of action include:\n\nNot any true description of what you do is an intentional action.\n(\u201cShe tripped over the rug\u201d)\nThe descriptions of what you intentionally do can be vague.\n(\u201cI\u2019m intentionally eating some jelly beans \u2013 but\nI\u2019m not intentionally eating some specific number of\nthem.\u201d)\nWhen you make a mistake, you might not do what you intend.\n(\u201cHe intended to unlock the door, but he mistakenly broke the\nknob.\u201d)\n\n\nAs we will see shortly, analogous claims can be made about sensation\nor perception.\n\nBut first, note that Anscombe distinguished sharply between two senses\nof the word \u201cobject\u201d \u2013 one of which is material\n(\u201cThere are ten objects on the bowling lane\u201d), while the\nother is intentional (\u201cImmortality was the object of his\ndesire\u201d), which otherwise needn\u2019t exist at all. An\nintentional object is given by a word or phrase which gives a\ndescription under which it is such (IOS, 9). She insists that\nneither sense of the word \u201cobject\u201d is deviant nor\nphilosophically uninteresting, but they are easily confused with each\nother.\n\nShe makes a foray into grammatical theory to illustrate the\npossibility of this distinction between senses of\n\u201cobject\u201d. Consider the sentence \u201cLuke gave Leia his\nlightsaber\u201d. If asked \u201cWhat object did Luke give\nLeia?\u201d, we would reply \u201chis lightsaber\u201d. And if\nasked for the direct object of the sentence, we would again reply\n\u201chis lightsaber\u201d. But although \u201chis\nlightsaber\u201d is indeed the direct object of the sentence, Luke\ndid not give Leia a direct object; to think otherwise is to confuse\nthe two senses. Moreover, \u201chis lightsaber\u201d is the direct\nobject of this sentence, even though no lightsaber materially exists.\nIt would be foolish to object to the claim that the direct object of\nthe sentence is \u201chis lightsaber\u201d on the grounds that\nlightsabers aren\u2019t real. Anscombe\u2019s insight is that\nlikewise there are also objects of perception in both a material and\nan intentional sense.\n\nIn light of the three claims above, Anscombe makes three analogous\nclaims about sense-perception:\n\nNot any true description of what you perceive is the intentional\nobject of what you perceive. For example, what you see might be a\npicture of a duck-rabbit drawn by the Queen, but you might not see it\nas a picture of a duck-rabbit, nor as a picture drawn by the Queen\n\u2013 you happen to see only a picture of a duck, the intentional\nobject of sight.\nYou might perceive something vaguely. For example, although the\ntree you see has 125 leaves (material object), you see only a tree\nwith an indeterminate number of leaves (intentional object).\nYou can perceive something that doesn\u2019t materially exist.\nFor example, after rubbing your eyes you might see stars (intentional\nobject), even though materially there are no stars to be seen.\n\n\nAnscombe maintained that certain philosophical views look inescapable\nonly if we conflate these two distinct senses. Idealism is the view\nthat we see only sense data, taking what is the intentional object of\nperception also to be the material objection of perception. On the\nother hand, direct realism (or what she calls \u2018ordinary language\nphilosophy\u2019) holds that we see only material objects without any\nintermediaries, overlooking or dismissing the legitimate use of saying\nthings like \u201cNow I see stars\u201d after getting hit on the\nhead. They thereby ignore or misunderstand the relevance of the\nintentional sense of sense-perception. Thus neither idealism nor\ndirect realism recognizes the importance of the distinction between\ntwo ways of thinking about verbs of sense-perception. Both views thus\nfail to recognize the distinct intentionality of sensation.\n\nAlthough these two senses are distinct, Anscombe notes that sometimes\npeople use the word \u201csee\u201d and other verbs of\nsense-perception without definitely intending it either only\nmaterially or only intentionally. Only further questioning would nudge\nthem to make their meaning more specific.\n",
