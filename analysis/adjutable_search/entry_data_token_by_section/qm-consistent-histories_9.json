    "main_text": "Quantum Probabilities || Quantum states as pre-probabilities\n3.5 Quantum states as pre-probabilities\nOnce a quantum sample space has been chosen the question arises of\nhow probabilities are to be assigned to the different projectors of\nwhich it is composed. As in other applications of probability theory\nsuch assignments may represent pure guesswork, or contain parameters\nwhich are to be adjusted according to experimental data, or be based\nupon some other information about the system, such as prior\npreparation or a later measurement. Information about the preparation\nof a quantum system is often expressed using a density\noperator \\(\\rho\\), a positive semidefinite operator (Hermitian with\nnonnegative eigenvalues) with trace (sum of the eigenvalues) equal to\n1, used as a pre-probability in the terminology of Sec. 9.4\nof Griffiths (2002a), a mathematical\nobject that can be used to generate a probability distribution. In\nparticular if \\(\\{P_j\\}\\) is a projective decomposition of the identity,\na quantum sample space, one assigns a probability\n\\[p_j = \\text{Tr}(\\rho P_j) \\label{eqn11}\\]\nto the property \\(P_j\\). Very often \\(\\rho\\) is referred to as the\n\u201cquantum state\u201d, since it is somewhat analogous to a\nprobability distribution, e.g., a \u201cGibbs state\u201d, in\nclassical statistical mechanics. The name\n\u201cpre-probability\u201d refers to the fact that \\(\\rho\\) can be\nused to generate many different probability distributions for\ndifferent choices of the sample space.\nWhereas the distinction between quantum properties and quantum\nstates in the sense of pre-probabilities is often evident from the\ncontext and the use of different symbols, the case of a \u201cpure\nstate\u201d in which the density operator can be written as a rank\none projector or dyad, \\(\\rho =\\dya{\\psi}\\), can lead to confusion in\nthat the same mathematical object can represent either a\npre-probability or a property. Indeed, there is a close connection in\nthat if for such a \\(\\rho\\) one introduces a sample space\n\\(\\{[\\psi],I-]\\psi]\\}\\), the probability of the property \\([\\psi]\\) is 1,\nwhich is to say that if one uses this particular sample space\nthe quantum system certainly has the property \\([\\psi]\\). But if this\nsame \\(\\rho\\) is used as a pre-probability for some other sample space,\nand if one ignores the single framework rule, it is easy to fall into\nthe trap of thinking that \\([\\psi]\\) and some other incompatible\nproperty corresponding to a projector that does not commute with\n\\([\\psi]\\) can both be true, which makes no sense. The best known\nexample of the confusion that results is Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s infamous\ndead-and-alive cat, subsection 10.1.\n",
