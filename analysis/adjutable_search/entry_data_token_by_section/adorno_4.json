Negative Dialectics\n\n\nAdorno's idea of artistic truth content presupposes the\nepistemological and metaphysical claims he works out most thoroughly\nin Negative Dialectics. These claims, in turn, consolidate\nand extend the historiographic and social-theoretical arguments\nalready canvassed. As Simon Jarvis demonstrates, Negative\nDialectics tries to formulate a \u201cphilosophical materialism\u201d that\nis historical and critical but not dogmatic. Alternatively, one can\ndescribe the book as a \u201cmetacritique\u201d of idealist philosophy,\nespecially of the philosophy of Kant and Hegel (Jarvis 1998,\n148\u201374; O'Connor 2004). Adorno says the book aims to complete what he considered his\nlifelong task as a philosopher: \u201cto use the strength of the\n[epistemic] subject to break through the deception [Trug] of\nconstitutive subjectivity\u201d (ND xx).\n\n\nThis occurs in four stages. First, a long Introduction (ND 1\u201357)\nworks out a concept of \u201cphilosophical experience\u201d that\nboth challenges Kant's distinction between \u201cphenomena\u201d and\n\u201cnoumena\u201d and rejects Hegel's construction of\n\u201cabsolute spirit.\u201d Then Part One (ND 59\u2013131)\ndistinguishes Adorno's project from the \u201cfundamental\nontology\u201d in Heidegger's Being and Time. Part Two (ND\n133\u2013207) works out Adorno's alternative with respect to the\ncategories he reconfigures from German idealism. Part Three (ND\n209\u2013408), composing nearly half the book, elaborates\nphilosophical \u201cmodels.\u201d These present negative dialectics\nin action upon key concepts of moral philosophy\n(\u201cfreedom\u201d), philosophy of history (\u201cworld\nspirit\u201d and \u201cnatural history\u201d), and\nmetaphysics. Adorno says the final model, devoted to metaphysical\nquestions, \u201ctries by critical self reflection to give the\nCopernican revolution an axial turn\u201d (ND xx). Alluding to Kant's\nself-proclaimed \u201csecond Copernican revolution,\u201d this\ndescription echoes Adorno's comment about breaking through the\ndeception of constitutive subjectivity.\n\n\nLike Hegel, Adorno criticizes Kant's distinction between phenomena and\nnoumena by arguing that the transcendental conditions of experience\ncan be neither so pure nor so separate from each other as Kant seems\nto claim. As concepts, for example, the a priori categories of the faculty of\nunderstanding (Verstand) would be unintelligible if they were\nnot already about something that is nonconceptual.  Conversely, the\nsupposedly pure forms of space and time cannot simply be nonconceptual\nintuitions. Not even a transcendental philosopher would have access to\nthem apart from concepts about them. So too, what makes possible any\ngenuine experience cannot simply be the \u201capplication\u201d of a priori\nconcepts to a priori intuitions via the \u201cschematism\u201d of the\nimagination (Einbildungskraft). Genuine experience is made\npossible by that which exceeds the grasp of thought and\nsensibility. Adorno does not call this excess the \u201cthing in itself,\u201d\nhowever, for that would assume the Kantian framework he\ncriticizes. Rather, he calls it \u201cthe nonidentical\u201d (das\nNichtidentische).\n\n\nThe concept of the nonidentical, in turn, marks the difference between\nAdorno's materialism and Hegel's idealism. Although he shares Hegel's\nemphasis on a speculative identity between thought and being, between\nsubject and object, and between reason and reality, Adorno denies that\nthis identity has been achieved in a positive fashion. For the most\npart this identity has occurred negatively instead. That is to say,\nhuman thought, in achieving identity and unity, has imposed these upon\nobjects, suppressing or ignoring their differences and diversity.\nSuch imposition is driven by a societal formation whose exchange\nprinciple demands the equivalence (exchange value) of what is\ninherently nonequivalent (use value). Whereas Hegel's speculative\nidentity amounts to an identity between identity and nonidentity,\nAdorno's amounts to a nonidentity between identity and nonidentity.\nThat is why Adorno calls for a \u201cnegative dialectic\u201d and\nwhy he rejects the affirmative character of Hegel's dialectic (ND\n143\u201361).\n\n\nAdorno does not reject the necessity of conceptual identification,\nhowever, nor does his philosophy claim to have direct access to the\nnonidentical. Under current societal conditions, thought can only have\naccess to the nonidentical via conceptual criticisms of false\nidentifications. Such criticisms must be \u201cdeterminate negations,\u201d\npointing up specific contradictions between what thought claims and\nwhat it actually delivers. Through determinate negation, those aspects\nof the object which thought misidentifies receive an indirect,\nconceptual articulation.\n\n\nThe motivation for Adorno's negative dialectic is not simply\nconceptual, however, nor are its intellectual resources. His\nepistemology is \u201cmaterialist\u201d in both regards. It is\nmotivated, he says, by undeniable human suffering\u2014a fact of\nunreason, if you will, to counter Kant's \u201cfact of reason.\u201d\nSuffering is the corporeal imprint of society and the object upon\nhuman consciousness: \u201cThe need to let suffering speak is a\ncondition of all truth. For suffering is objectivity that weighs upon\nthe subject \u2026 \u201d (ND 17\u201318). The resources available\nto philosophy in this regard include the \u201cexpressive\u201d or\n\u201cmimetic\u201d dimensions of language, which conflict with\n\u201cordinary\u201d (i.e., societally sanctioned) syntax and\nsemantics. In philosophy, this requires an emphasis on\n\u201cpresentation\u201d (Darstellung) in which logical\nstringency and expressive flexibility interact (ND 18\u201319,\n52\u201353). Another resource lies in unscripted relationships among\nestablished concepts. By taking such concepts out of their established\npatterns and rearranging them in \u201cconstellations\u201d around a\nspecific subject matter, philosophy can unlock some of the historical\ndynamic hidden within objects whose identity exceeds the\nclassifications imposed upon them (ND 52\u201353, 162\u201366).\n\n\nWhat unifies all of these desiderata, and what most clearly\ndistinguishes Adorno's materialist epistemology from \u201cidealism,\u201d\nwhether Kantian or Hegelian, is his insisting on the \u201cpriority of the\nobject\u201d (Vorrang des Objekts, ND 183\u201397). Adorno regards as\n\u201cidealist\u201d any philosophy that affirms an identity between subject and\nobject and thereby assigns constitutive priority to the epistemic\nsubject. In insisting on the priority of the object, Adorno repeatedly\nmakes three claims: first, that the epistemic subject is itself\nobjectively constituted by the society to which it belongs and without\nwhich the subject could not exist; second, that no object can be fully\nknown according to the rules and procedures of identitarian thinking;\nthird, that the goal of thought itself, even when thought forgets its\ngoal under societally induced pressures to impose identity on objects,\nis to honor them in their nonidentity, in their difference from what a\nrestricted rationality declares them to be. Against empiricism,\nhowever, he argues that no object is simply \u201cgiven\u201d either, both\nbecause it can be an object only in relation to a subject and because\nobjects are historical and have the potential to change.\n\n\nUnder current conditions the only way for philosophy to give priority\nto the object is dialectically, Adorno argues. He describes dialectics\nas the attempt to recognize the nonidentity between thought and the\nobject while carrying out the project of conceptual\nidentification. Dialectics is \u201cthe consistent consciousness of\nnonidentity,\u201d and contradiction, its central category, is \u201cthe\nnonidentical under the aspect of identity.\u201d Thought itself forces this\nemphasis on contradiction upon us, he says. To think is to identify,\nand thought can achieve truth only by identifying. So the semblance\n(Schein) of total identity lives within thought itself,\nmingled with thought's truth (Wahrheit). The only way to\nbreak through the semblance of total identity is immanently, using the\nconcept. Accordingly, everything that is qualitatively different and\nthat resists conceptualization will show up as a contradiction. \u201cThe\ncontradiction is the nonidentical under the aspect of [conceptual]\nidentity; the primacy of the principle of contradiction in dialectics\ntests the heterogeneous according to unitary thought\n[Einheitsdenken]. By colliding with its own boundary\n[Grenze], unitary thought surpasses itself. Dialectics is the\nconsistent consciousness of nonidentity\u201d (ND 5).\n\n\nBut thinking in contradictions is also forced upon philosophy by\nsociety itself. Society is riven with fundamental antagonisms, which,\nin accordance with the exchange principle, get covered up by\nidentitarian thought. The only way to expose these antagonisms, and\nthereby to point toward their possible resolution, is to think against\nthought\u2014in other words, to think in contradictions. In this way\n\u201ccontradiction\u201d cannot be ascribed neatly to either thought or\nreality.  Instead it is a \u201ccategory of reflection\u201d\n(Reflexionskategorie) , enabling a thoughtful confrontation\nbetween concept (Begriff) and subject matter or object\n(Sache): \u201cTo proceed dialectically means to think in\ncontradictions, for the sake of the contradiction already experienced\nin the object [Sache], and against that contradiction. A\ncontradiction in reality, [dialectics] is a contradiction against\nreality\u201d (ND 144\u201345).\n\n\nThe point of thinking in contradictions is not simply negative,\nhowever. It has a fragile, transformative horizon, namely, a society\nthat would no longer be riven with fundamental antagonisms, thinking\nthat would be rid of the compulsion to dominate through conceptual\nidentification, and the flourishing of particular objects in their\nparticularity. Because Adorno is convinced that contemporary society\nhas the resources to alleviate the suffering it nevertheless\nperpetuates, his negative dialectics has a utopian reach: \u201cIn view of\nthe concrete possibility of utopia, dialectics is the ontology of the\nfalse condition. A right condition would be freed from dialectics, no\nmore system than contradiction\u201d (ND 11). Such a \u201cright condition\u201d\nwould be one of reconciliation between humans and nature, including\nthe nature within human beings, and among human beings\nthemselves. This idea of reconciliation sustains Adorno's reflections\non ethics and metaphysics.\n",
