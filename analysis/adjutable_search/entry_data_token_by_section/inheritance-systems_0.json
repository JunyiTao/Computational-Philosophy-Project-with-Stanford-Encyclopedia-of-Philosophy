    "main_text": "Introduction || Heredity and Inheritance\n1.1 Heredity and Inheritance\n\nIt is useful to distinguish between the following terms. The terms\nheredity and hereditary will be used henceforth to\nrefer to reliable resemblance relations between parents and offspring.\nParticular traits (phenotypic or genotypic) may be hereditary in this\n sense.[1]\n The term inheritance will be used to refer to causal\nprocesses of transmission between parents and offspring that account\nfor heredity, and the mechanisms responsible for them. We might, for\nexample, say that eye color is hereditary, and that genetic\ninheritance accounts for the heredity of eye color (or, more formally,\nfor the heredity of variations in eye color). Multiple inheritance\nprocesses may be implicated in the heredity of a particular phenotypic\ntrait. Inheritance is often construed as transmission of information,\nthough this notion raises difficulties; this issue is discussed in\n section 2.4.\n\nThe terms parent and offspring are used in a general\nsense, since transmission may be from individuals other than the\ngenetic parents of the organism (i.e., non-vertical). Multiple\ninheritance systems may lead to multiple\n\u201cparent-offspring\u201d relations.\n",
