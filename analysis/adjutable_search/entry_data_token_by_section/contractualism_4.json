    "main_text": "How does contractualism differ from utilitarianism? || Reasons beyond well-being\n3.2 Reasons beyond well-being\n\nA further resource available to contractualism that is not available\nto utilitarianism is that my reasons for rejecting a principle are not\nlimited to my well-being\u2014however broadly that notion is\nconstrued. For ease of exposition, let us for the moment follow the\nutilitarian, and think of \u2018burdens\u2019 solely in terms of\nnegative impact on my well-being. My reason for rejecting a principle\nmight be, not so much that it imposes a certain burden on me, but the\nway in which it imposes that burden\u2014and what the principle thus\nsays about me. For instance, consider a principle that allocates\nbenefits and burdens on the basis of race, and contrast this with a\nprinciple that allocates the same benefits and burdens randomly. I\ncannot reject the racist principle simply because of the burden it\nimposes on me\u2014after all, the random principle imposes an\nidentical burden on someone else. Rather, I reject the racist\nprinciple because, by regarding my race as a relevant ground for the\ndistribution of benefits, it imposes that burden in a way that\nconstitutes a failure to respect my status as a person.\n\nIf we abandon the utilitarian link between burdens and well-being,\nthen we might say that the method of distribution of burdens itself\nimposes an additional burden of a different kind\u2014the burden of\nnot being respected. Similarly, I might reject a principle that\narbitrarily exempts some people from a burden borne by everyone else,\non the grounds that such a principle treats me unfairly\u2014even if\nthe alternative is a principle that places that burden on everyone.\nFor instance, imagine a situation where, in order to preserve the\ngrass, we need at least 90% of the people to avoid walking on the\ngrass, but it doesn\u2019t do any harm if 10% do walk on the grass. I\nmight object to a principle that allows the members of a privileged\nracial minority to walk on the grass, even if my preferred principle\nis one where no-one gets to enjoy grass-walking. My rejection is not\nbased on envy, but on the disrespect this principle shows by regarding\nrace as a legitimate ground for distribution.\n\nContractualist reasons are more flexible than\naggregation, as they allow us to respond directly to morally\nrelevant considerations, rather than having to rely upon some complex\nutilitarian calculation. (Think of the artificial epicycles a\nutilitarian needs to go through to reject a principle that efficiently\nmaximises happiness, but happens to be racist or arbitrary.) By moving\nstraight to the moral heart of the matter, contractualism also seems\nto offer a more satisfying explanation of why certain\nbehaviour is wrong.\n\nContractualism can thus produce principles that balance the interests\nof different people against one another, without explicit appeal to\naggregation. This is a significant development in moral philosophy, as\nit enables us to separate arguments against utilitarianism into two\nclasses: arguments against impartiality and arguments against\naggregation. Objections in the first class also apply to\ncontractualism, while those in the second class do not. We return to\naggregation in\n section 8;\n and consider one common objection to impartiality in\n section 9.\n Once contractualism has entered the field, we cannot treat arguments\nfor impartiality as if they were arguments for utilitarianism\nitself.\n",
