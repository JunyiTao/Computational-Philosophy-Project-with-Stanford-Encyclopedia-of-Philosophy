His view, which derived in part from Francis Bacon, has\nmany parallels with that of his fellow experimenter Robert Hooke and\nthis Bacon-Boyle-Hooke philosophy of experiment came to exert great\ninfluence on the development of natural philosophy in the late\nseventeenth century (Anstey 2014).\n\nBoyle\u2019s view of experiment is best understood in the context of\nthe newly emerging experimental philosophy of the early Royal Society\nof London in the early 1660s and its precursor groups in Oxford in the\nlate 1650s. At this time the discipline of natural philosophy was\nshifting from being regarded as a speculative science, like, say,\ntheology, to being an operative or practical science in which\nexperiments played a central role.\n\nThe first tenet of Boyle\u2019s philosophy of experiment is that\nobservation and experiment should have epistemic priority over theory.\nThat is, one should accept only those principles and axioms in natural\nphilosophy that are based upon sufficient observational and\nexperimental evidence and one should avoid constructing a theory\nwithout recourse to observation and experiment. Speculative philosophy\ncommences with principles that are accepted without recourse to\nexperiment, whereas experimental philosophy begins with observation\nand experiment and only then proceeds to theory.\n\nSecondly, Boyle believes that although one should not start\none\u2019s inquiries from untested principles, one can nevertheless\nreason upon experiments:\n\nNot that I at all disallow the use of Reasoning upon Experiments, or\nthe endeavouring to discern as early as we can the Confederations, and\nDifferences, and Tendencies of things: For such an absolute suspension\nof the exercise of Reasoning were exceedingly troublesome, if not\nimpossible. (BW, 2:14)\n\n\nIt is hardly surprising then to find that Boyle wrote quite\nextensively on the relation between experimental philosophy and\nspeculative philosophy and on the usefulness of reason to the\nexperimental philosopher. For example, in a catalogue of his\nunpublished works dating from 1684 there is listed a work entitled\n\u201cOf Usefulnes of Speculative & Experimental Philosophy to\none another\u201d (BW, 14:342). Unhappily this work is no longer\nextant.\n\nThirdly, according to Boyle, once a theory is constructed, the natural\nphilosopher should be prepared to revise it in the light of new\nexperimental evidence: \u201cI would have such kind of\nsuperstructures look\u2019d upon only as temporary ones\n\u2026\u201d (BW, 2:14). The only things that Boyle will remain\ncertain of are matters of fact: \u201cI dare speak confidently and\npositively of very few things, except Matters of Fact\u201d (BW,\n2:19).\n\nFourthly, while Boyle believed in ultimate causes underlying natural\nphenomena, he also acquiesced in Bacon\u2019s conception of a scale\nof causes and the need to discover intermediate causes en\nroute to ultimate explanations:\n\nthere are oftentimes so many subordinate Causes between particular\nEffects and the most General Causes of things, that there is left a\nlarge field wherein to exercise Mens Industry and Reason, if they will\nbut solidly enough deduce the Properties of things from more general\nand familiar Qualities, and also intermediate Causes (if I may so call\nthem) from one another. (BW, 2:23)\n\n\nOne such intermediate cause that was of great importance for Boyle is\nthe spring (or pressure) of the air (see Anstey 2002b; Chalmers 2012).\nBoyle was aware that this quality was not one of those causes\n\u201cthat are the highest in the scale or series of Causes\u201d\n(BW, 2:21), and that he had to be content with its intermediate\nstatus.\n\nThis cluster of doctrines about experiment was set in Boyle\u2019s\nwritings within a broader Baconian context, namely the Baconian method\nof natural history. Baconian natural histories were, in the first\ninstance, vast collections of matters of fact derived from observation\nand experiment and which were to provide the foundation for natural\nphilosophical theorising. (In fact, few natural philosophers were able\nto respect this two-stage process.) They are to be distinguished from\nclassificatory natural history that was concerned with describing and\nclassifying natural kinds (Ogilvie 2006). Thus, many of Boyle\u2019s\nactual experimental reports are found in works that are natural\nhistories after the style of Francis Bacon. For example, Boyle viewed\nhis famous air-pump experiments that led eventually to the discovery\nof Boyle\u2019s Law, as part of a broader natural history of the air.\nIndeed, the philosopher John Locke, who was also committed to the\nBaconian method of natural history, edited Boyle\u2019s General\nHistory of the Air and saw it through the press the year after\nBoyle died.\n\nThere are two important implications for Boyle\u2019s philosophy of\nexperiment that derive from the natural historical context in which it\nwas set. First, it accounts for the fact that many of Boyle\u2019s\nexperiments were almost completely divorced from theory \u2013 they\nwere experiments that \u201chad a life of their own,\u201d \u2013\nto use Ian Hacking\u2019s felicitous phrase (Hacking 1983, chapter\n9). Secondly, the natural historical context helps to explain the very\nrich typology of experiments that Boyle used. Boyle followed Bacon in\ndistinguishing between luciferous (light-bearing) experiments that\nrevealed underlying causes and fructiferous (fruit-bearing)\nexperiments, that produced useful knowledge and technologies. This\ndistinction was widely used in the seventeenth century. Another type\nof experiment that derives from Bacon, was named by Boyle and was made\nfamous by Newton. This was the crucial experiment (experimentum\ncrucis) (BW, 3:50\u20131).\n\nHe also coined the term \u2018exploratory experiment\u2019 to\ndescribe a form of experimentation that includes \u2018The devising\nof New and convenient Tools or other Instruments for altering the\nusual State or the common course of things, and for thereby reducing\nnature to vary her Course and afford the Enquirers some new\nPhaenomena\u2019 (BP, 9:52). This is clearly a precursor of the\nmodern notion of exploratory experiment (Steinle 2016).\n\nBoyle was fully aware that some of the central tenets of his view of\nexperiments and his own natural historical methodology derived from\nthe writings of Francis Bacon. But he did not believe that Bacon was\nthe first to practise experimental philosophy. Interestingly, Boyle\nbelieved that his approach to natural philosophy found precedents in\nsome of the presocratic philosophers, such as the Greek atomist\nDemocritus and the (shadowy) Phoenician Moschus whom he surmised were\nexperimental corpuscularians (Levitin 2014).\n",
