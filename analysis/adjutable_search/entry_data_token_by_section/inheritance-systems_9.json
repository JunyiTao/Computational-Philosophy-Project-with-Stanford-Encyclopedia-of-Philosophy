    "main_text": "Classification of Inheritance Systems\n3. Classification of Inheritance Systems\n\nIt is now fairly common in biological discourse to talk about various\nforms of inheritance in addition to genetic inheritance. The two types\nof inheritance most often referred to are probably cellular epigenetic\ninheritance and cultural and behavioral inheritance in humans and\nvarious animals. There is however no standardized or de facto system\nor nomenclature used to classify inheritance systems and their\nproperties. This is partly due to the wide range of hereditary\nphenomena and the debates described earlier. A principled taxonomy\nwould provide a guide for identifying inheritance systems, delimiting\nthem from one another, comparing their properties and possible\nfunctions, and so on.\n\nThis section begins by making clear the distinction between\ninheritance systems and channels of inheritance. Various criteria that\nhave been proposed for identifying inheritance systems are then\npresented. The section concludes with a detailed discussion of the\ninfluential account of inheritance systems presented by Jablonka and\nLamb and a discussion of ecological inheritance and niche\nconstruction.\n",
