    "main_text": "Linguistic Methodology and Data || Grammaticality and acceptability judgments\n3.2 Grammaticality and acceptability judgments\n\nEssentialists who accept the competence/performance distinction of\nChomsky (1965) traditionally emphasize elicited acceptability judgment\ndata (although they need not reject data that is gathered using other\nmethods). But as Cowart notes:\n\nIn this view, which exploits the distinction between competence and\nperformance, the act of expressing a judgment of acceptability is a\nkind of linguistic performance. The grammar that a [generative\nEssentialist] linguistic theory posits in the head of a speaker does\nnot exercise exhaustive control of judgments\u2026 While forming a\nsentence judgment, a speaker draws on a variety of cognitive\nresources\u2026 The resulting [acceptability] judgments could\npattern quite differently than the grammaticality values we might like\nthem to reflect. (Cowart 1997: 7)\n\n\nThe grammaticality of an expression, on the standard generative\nEssentialist view, is the status conferred on it by the competence\nstate of an ideal speaker. But competence can never be exercised or\nused without potentially interfering performance factors like memory\nbeing exercised as well. This means that judgments about\ngrammaticality are never really directly available to the linguist\nthrough informant judgments: they have to be inferred from judgments\nof acceptability (along with any other relevant evidence).\nNevertheless, Essentialists do take acceptability judgments to provide\nfairly good evidence concerning the character of linguistic\ncompetence. In fact the use of informally gathered acceptability\njudgment data is a hallmark of post-1965 Essentialist practice.\n\nIt would be a mistake, however, to suppose that only Essentialists\nmake use of such judgments. Many contemporary Externalists and\nEmergentists who reject the competence/performance distinction still\nuse informally gathered acceptability judgments in linguistic\ntheorizing, though perhaps not in theory testing. Emergentists tend to\ninterpret experimentally gathered judgment data as performance data\nreflecting the interactions between learned features of communication\nsystems and general learning mechanisms as deployed in communication.\nAnd Externalists use judgment data for corpus cleaning (see\nbelow).\n\nIt should be noted that sociolinguists and anthropological linguists\n(and we regard them as tending toward Emergentist views) often\ninformally elicit informant judgments not only about acceptability but\nalso about social and regional style and variation, and meaning. They\nmay ask informants questions like, \u201cWho would typically say\nthat?\u201d, or \u201cWhat does X mean in context XYZ?\u201d, or\n\u201cIf you can say WXY, can you say WXZ?\u201d (see Labov 1996:\n77).\n",
