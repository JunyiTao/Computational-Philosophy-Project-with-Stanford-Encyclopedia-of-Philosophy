Ethical, Social and Political Philosophy\n\nAlthough Schlegel\u2019s importance for ethical, social and political\nphilosophy has often been ignored or unjustly criticized, recent\ninterpreters have shown how Schlegel took himself as offering a\nresponse to a number of key challenges in the philosophical ethics of\nhis era, from Jacobian worries about nihilism (Gorodeisky 2011) to\nKantian rigorism and dualism (Crowe 2010). For the young Schlegel,\nconsideration of ethical and political matters was never far removed\nfrom consideration of the aesthetic. Like Schleiermacher and the young\nHegel, Schlegel puts a strong emphasis in his early ethical writings\non the notion of love. In his essay \u201cOn the Limits of the\nBeautiful\u201d (\u00dcber die Grenzen des Sch\u00f6nen,\n1794), he argues that love is the highest form of aesthetic enjoyment\nand can only be realized between free and equal beings (Beiser 1992,\n248). Part of Schlegel\u2019s larger political animus lay always (in early\nas well as late phases of his career) in a refashioning of the\nrelationship between the sexes. In his early phase, Schlegel shared\nwith other Romantics a sense of the political and social importance of\nthe revolutionary period. In his \u201cEssay on the Concept of\nRepublicanism occasioned by the Kantian Tract Perpetual\nPeace\u201d (Versuch \u00fcber den Begriff des\nRepublikanismus, 1797), a commentary on sections of Kant\u2019s\nPerpetual Peace, Schlegel moves to a far more democratic view\nof politics than Kant defended: Schlegel advocates not only the\n\u201cnecessarily democratic\u201d nature of republicanism and the\n\u201cmajesty\u201d of the people as expressed in a majority, as\nwell as the \u201cpolitical imperative\u201d of making all nations\nrepublican, but\u2014especially decisive against Kant\u2019s restrictions\non political activism\u2014argued that insurrection was legitimate in\ncertain cases. Schlegel\u2019s political radicalism in this period comes\nmuch closer to Fichte than Kant and, in fact, rivals the claims for\nuniversal extension of suffrage advocated by Herder and Georg\nForster.\n\nIt is all the more striking, of course, that the politics of the later\nSchlegel, as he takes up a position in the Austrian court, turn\ndecisively more conservative. His late essay \u201cSignature of the\nAge\u201d (Signatur des Zeitalters, 1820) attacks the twin\nevils of idealism and British-American parliamentary government. As\nopposed to the machine-like state, Schlegel advocates as his ideal an\n\u201corganic\u201d Christian state consisting of\n\u201ccorporations\u201d that form a living whole around the monarch\n(church, school, family, guild\u2014a series of social institutions\nsimilar to that visible in the corporatist philosophy espoused in\nHegel\u2019s philosophy of right during the same time period).\n",
