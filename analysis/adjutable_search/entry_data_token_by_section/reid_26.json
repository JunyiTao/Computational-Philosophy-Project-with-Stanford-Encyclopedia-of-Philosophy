    "main_text": "Aesthetics || Expressivism\n7.1 Expressivism\n\n\nIn both Logic, Rhetoric and the Fine Arts and Fine\nArts, Reid shows a commitment to the importance of emotion and of\nexpression in understanding art and artworks. He writes,\n\u201cExpression is the capital thing in all Compositions of\nMusic\u201d (Logic, Rhetoric and the Fine Arts 288) but\ntextual evidence for an expression theory in those works is\nequivocal compared with Reid's remarks in EIP and in his\ncorrespondence. In lecture notes Reid appears partially to endorse\nexpression theory and partially to endorse emotional arousal\ntheory. Emotional arousal theories of art are closely related to\nexpression theories since both appeal to emotion as an essential\nfeature of an artwork's aesthetic quality, but they differ on a\ncrucial point. Emotional arousal theories explain the aesthetic\nquality of an artwork in terms of the way an artwork causes the\nexpression or experience of emotion in the viewer or listener, and not\n(as on expression theory) in terms of the way in which an artwork's\naesthetic qualities are caused by the artist's representation of his\nor her emotion in qualities of the artwork. In Reid's discussion\nin Lectures on the Fine Arts he appears to combine both\ntheories to suggest that the emotion expressed by the artist must also\nbe the same emotion aroused in the viewer or listener. The playwright\nintroduces \u201ca sign or expression of the passions, & when\nthis is accomplished, it affects us and causes the same passion in\nus...\u201d (Lectures on the Fine Arts 51). In his mature,\npublished work, advocacy of the emotional arousal theory\ndiminishes.\n\n\nIn his taxonomy of the fine arts, Reid includes: literature, drama,\npainting, sculpture, architecture and wordless music. The inclusion of\nwordless music was a novelty for the time (EIP 7.4, 605). Beauty\nrepresented through the harmony and melody of music arises because of\nthe emotion expressed by the harmony and melody. Often harmony and\nmelody represent emotions by representing the nature of a\nconversation. Though obvious in some music with words and in vocal\nmusic, even the beauty of wordless music can be explained in part in\nthis way:\nWhen discord arises occasionally in conversation, but soon\nterminates in perfect amity, we receive more pleasure than from\nperfect unanimity. In like manner, in the harmony of music, discordant\nsounds are occasionally introduced, but it is always in order to give\na relish to the most perfect concord that follows (EIP 7.4,\n605).\n\n\nReid describes the way melody represents the human voice's expression\nof sentiment as a form of \u2018imitation.\u2019\n\n\nPainting and sculpture follow the same pattern of analysis. In\nthe Inquiry Reid says that painting is a representational art\nand that when a painting \u201chappily expresses a passion by its\nproper signs, every one understands the meaning of these signs,\nwithout art, and without reflection\u201d (IHM 6.8, 102). Dominant\nspecies of painting include portraiture and landscape both of which\nare well suited to express emotion through visual\nrepresentations. Naturally Reid places importance on the depiction of\nthe \u201cpassion & dispositions of men in the attitudes and\ncountenances\u201d (Lectures on the Fine Arts 50) in\npainting and sculpture. Reid holds that the \u201cchief part\u201d\nof the beauty of paintings is their representation of the expression\nof emotions. Reid's aesthetics of poetry closely resembles his\naesthetics of music and painting (Lectures on the Fine Arts\n51).\n\n\nSeveral philosophical issues arise from the discussion thus\nfar. First, if we interpret Reid's discussion of aesthetics\ndevelopmentally and we therefore discount certain commitments\nin Lectures that are not repeated in Intellectual\nPowers, then Reid skirts some traditionally troublesome problems\nfor expression theories of art. On this interpretation, Reid's mature\ntheory does not include a commitment to the claim that it is essential\nfor something to be a work of art that the artwork must be imbued with\nan emotion by the artist that the artwork also arouses in the viewer\nor listener. Second, oddly for an expressivist, Reid rarely describes\nthe cognitive and non-cognitive process whereby an artist creates an\nartwork (Gallie 1998, 178). But if an artwork's aesthetic properties\nare those properties that have been imbued in it in part through the\nartist's experience of emotion, presumably the nature of the creative\nprocess bears heavily on expression theories of art.\n",
