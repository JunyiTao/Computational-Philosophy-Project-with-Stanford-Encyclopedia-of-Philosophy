    "main_text": "The Representation of Properties || Which Color Properties are Represented?\n4.1 Which Color Properties are Represented?\n\nThe literature on how properties are represented in experience has\nfocused largely on the case of visual experience and color properties.\nThe question of how color is represented in experience is a good case\nwith which to review debates about what sorts of contents experiences\nhave. But one should generalize from the case of color experience with\ncaution: views that seem strongest for the case of color properties\nmay seem weaker for cases of other properties; views that seem\nstrongest for the case of visual experience may seem weaker for other\nmodalities, or for combinations of modalities.\n\nThe central issue here\u2014which color-related properties are\nrepresented in experience\u2014is closely tied up with the more\ngeneral question of how the phenomenology of experience relates to its\nhaving contents. These more general issues are discussed in\n Section 7;\n but because the general discussion to date has focused so narrowly on\ncolor and visual experience, the considerations overlap greatly.\n\nIt is widely held that visual experiences represent color properties,\nattributing them to objects, surfaces, volumes and locations. However,\nthere is substantial debate about what experiences represent when they\nrepresent colors. Let R-experiences be experiences with\nphenomenal character R, where R is the phenomenal\ncharacter that normal perceivers have when they see red things. Let\nG-experiences be experiences with phenomenal character\nG, where G is the phenomenal character that normal perceivers\nhave when they see green things.\n\nAccording to a simple theory, G experiences represents\ngreenness, and R experiences represent redness. An objection\nto this theory arises from a putative case of inverted qualia\nwithout illusion. The case goes like this. One perceiver, call\nher Nonvert, typically has R-experiences when she veridically\nperceives and is in causal contact with red things, and she typically\nhas G-experiences when she veridically perceives and is in\ncausal contact with green things. Another perceiver, call him Invert,\ntypically has R-experiences when he veridically perceives and\nis in causal contact with green things, and has G-experiences\nwhen he veridically perceives and is in causal contact with red\nthings. So, in the thought experiment, when Invert, with his\nG-experiences, sees a red tomato, his experience represents\nredness; when Nonvert sees the same tomato with his\nR-experiences, his experiences also represents redness.\n\nOn the assumption that experiences with the same color phenomenology\nwill have the same color content, this thought experiment challenges\nthe simple theory we began with, since it purports to describe a case\nin which a G-experience is an experience of veridically seeing red.\nDefenders of the simple theory may reject the assumption.\nAlternatively, they may challenge the part of the thought experiment\nthat purports to describe inverted qualia without illusion.\nThat is, they may challenge the idea that Invert\u2019s\nG-experiences veridically represent redness, rather than\nnon-veridically representing greenness. In response to this challenge,\nmost interpretations of this thought experiment build in substantive\nassumptions about what sorts of conditions are sufficient for making\nit the case that experiences represent one color property rather than\nanother. It is standardly said that the phenomenally different color\nexperiences come to represent the same property due to\nexternalism about color contents of experience, whereby when\na type of experience stands in the right sort of causal relations to,\nsay, redness, this suffices to make experiences of that type represent\nredness.\n\nIf the thought experiment describes a genuine possibility, there are\nat least three ways to modify the simple view: (i) Deny that content\nsupervenes on phenomenology, allowing that two experience with the\nsame color phenomenology can nonetheless differ in content. One\nversion of this response says that the phenomenal difference is a\n\u2018raw feel\u2019 or \u2018qualia\u2019 (see Block 1990, 1996);\nanother version holds that a single color property can present itself\nto a perceiver in phenomenally different ways. (ii) Hold that there\nare phenomenal differences between G-experiences that\nrepresent redness and G-experiences that represent greenness,\nso that \u2018G-experience\u2019 does not pick out a fully\ndeterminate phenomenal type An example of this response is\nexternalism about phenomenology, defended by Lycan 2001 and\nDretske 1995. (iii) Hold that there are contents shared by\nG-experiences that represent redness and\nG-experiences that represent greenness. This response is\ndeveloped by Thau 2002, who offers a Russellian version of it;\nChalmers 2004, who offers a Fregean version of it; and Shoemaker 1994,\n2005, who offers another Russellian version of it.\n\nResponses (i) and (ii) will be discussed in\n Section 7.\n Regarding response (iii), one Fregean theory about this thought\nexperiment is that it is a case in which the experiences of Invert and\nNonvert have different modes of presentation of the same color\nproperty (say, redness). On this view, redness would be presented in\nInvert\u2019s experience under a G-mode, and it would be\npresented in Nonvert\u2019s experience under a R-mode, so\nthat the phenomenal difference between Invert and Nonvert\u2019s\nexperience would also be a difference in Fregean content.\n\nA Russellian theory is that in addition to color properties, Invert\nand Nonvert\u2019s experiences of the red tomato also represent a\nproperty closely associated with redness but distinct from it, and is\nrepresented by and only by R-experiences. Shoemaker calls\nthese properties \u2018appearance properties\u2019. Call this the\nShoemaker proposal. (Shoemaker 1994, Thau 2002, though Thau\ndenies that colors are represented in experience, claiming that only\nthe other properties are\u2014so he does not accept the thought\nexperiment exactly as stated. For another denial that colors are\nrepresented in experiences see Tolliver 1994).\n\nA final theory about this thought experiment combines aspects of the\nFregean and Russellian proposals. It says that Invert\u2019s and\nNonvert\u2019s experience each has two contents associated with it.\nOne set of contents involves objects and properties represented by the\nexperiences; the other involves modes of presentation of these objects\nand properties. On this proposal, the object-property contents\nassociated with Invert\u2019s experiences are the same as\nNonvert\u2019s, but their modes of presentation are different.\n\nThe issue between the Fregean and Shoemaker proposals is subtle. Both\nagree (contrary to response (i), which includes the qualia view) that\nthe difference between Invert and Nonvert\u2019s experience of\nredness is a representational difference of some sort, as opposed to a\nraw feel. And both views posit entities associated with this\ndifference: appearance properties for the Shoemaker proposal; modes of\npresentation for the Fregean proposal. The difference concerns the\nstatus of the entities associated with yet distinct from color\nproperties: are they modes of presentation of the colors, or are they\nsimply other properties, represented alongside the colors (or instead\nof them, as Thau holds). In Shoemaker\u2019s 1994 version, color\nproperties are represented in experience by representing\nappearance properties. The issue is sometimes described by saying that\nthe Shoemaker proposal predicts that there are two\ncolor-associated ways that the tomato looks to be to each perceiver:\nit looks to be red; and it looks to have the appearance property. In\ncontrast, the Fregean view predicts that there is just one\ncolor-associated way that the tomato looks to be: it simply looks to\nbe red.\n\nA related question is which properties color experience represents\nthings as having when it represents them as being colored. Since color\nexperiences in principle could be systematically in error, this is\ndistinct from the ontological question of which properties the colors\nare, though the same options suggest themselves. According to one\nposition, when an experience represents that an apple is red, it\nrepresents that it has a disposition to cause certain kinds of\nexperiences. (See Langsam 2000 and McDowell 1985) According to an\nopposed position, when an experience represents that an apple is red,\nit represents that it has a non-dispositional property (McGinn 1983,\nJohnston 1992, Boghossian and Velleman 1992). One version of the\nlatter says that experience represents a primitive property that\ncannot be specified in non-chromatic terms (Broackes 1992, Campbell\n2003). Yet another says experience is neutral on whether redness is or\nisn\u2019t primitive. (Byrne and Hilbert 2003) Another question is\nwhether colors are represented as being properties of external\nobjects, or of sense-data (where these are private mental objects), or\nboth.\n",
