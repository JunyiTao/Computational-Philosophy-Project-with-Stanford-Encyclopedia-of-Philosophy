The Scope of Medieval Political Philosophy\n\n\u201cMedieval\u201d refers primarily to Europe (the term being\napplied to other cultures by analogy). Medieval philosophy includes\nthe \u201cpre-scholastic\u201d, \u201cscholastic\u201d and\n\u201clate scholastic\u201d periods.\n\n\u201cScholasticism\u201d refers to the intellectual culture\ncharacteristic of the medieval schools. In the twelfth century\nschooling became a flourishing industry in Paris, Bologna and many\nother places. By the early thirteenth century the masters of the\nschools in some places had formed corporations generally called\n universities.[3]\n The working language of the schools was Latin, and teachers and\nstudents were clergy. The universities got a great boost from the\ntranslation into Latin of the works of\n Aristotle,\n commentaries on Aristotle and related works in Greek or Arabic. These\ntranslations were made and copied because there was a public whose\ninterest in Aristotle had been formed by the schools of the twelfth\ncentury, in which some works of Aristotle that had been translated\nearlier (part of the logica vetus, the \u201cold\nlogic\u201d) were already objects of close study. In the\nuniversities, philosophy was studied in the Arts faculties, but\nphilosophy was developed and employed also in the faculties of\ntheology. The study of law was important in medieval universities and\nideas derived from the law were influential in political thinking.\nWriters on political philosophy used a number of the literary genres\ncharacteristic of scholasticism, such as the commentary, the disputed\nquestion, the dialogue, and the treatise (see the entry on\n literary forms of medieval philosophy).\n\n\u201cLate scholasticism\u201d conventionally begins with the\nfourteenth century and overlaps with the early modern period. The\npeople we think of as the early modern philosophers were trained in\nthe universities (or, in Descartes\u2019 case, in a Jesuit school),\nbut they wrote mostly outside the universities and mostly in\nvernacular languages. Philosophy of the scholastic kind continued,\ntaught and written in Latin, throughout the seventeenth century in the\nuniversities, especially in Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands, in the\nJesuit schools in many countries, and in some Protestant schools.\n\nThe \u201cpre-scholastic\u201d medieval period includes\n Abelard\n (1079\u20131142), and\n Anselm\n (1033\u20131109) and the writers of the Carolingian age, but it is\ndifficult to say how far back this period should be traced. Perhaps it\nshould include\n Boethius\n (c. 475/7\u2013526) and Augustine, who were deeply influential in\nEurope from their own time until the end of the middle ages (and\nbeyond), though they might also be regarded as belonging to late\nAntiquity. Boethius had written or translated from Greek into Latin\nsome of the logical works studied in the twelfth century schools;\nAugustine was the dominant influence in medieval theology. Boethius\nwrote nothing directly relevant to political philosophy, but Augustine\ncertainly did, so for the purposes of this article\n\u201cmedieval\u201d begins with Augustine.\n\nBy medieval political philosophy we understand the medieval\nwritings on politics that are recognizably akin to the modern writings\nwe class as political philosophy. Their authors were usually academics\nwho wrote with university-educated readers in mind; they drew upon\nideas explored in the schools and they wrote in an academic way. Some\nwrote commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Politics and academic\n\u201cdisputed questions\u201d related to topics of political\nphilosophy. However, political philosophy was not part of the\nuniversity core curriculum (Miethke 2000b). The authors of political\nwritings generally did not write these works in the course of their\nteaching duties. Generally they wrote in response to some political\nevent. Some wrote for the edification of a king or other ruler, others\nsought to influence conflicts between the Church and secular rulers,\nothers were concerned with conflicts within the Church about the\nconstitution of the Church and the powers of popes and councils. Often\nthey were committed to one or other side in these conflicts\u2014many\nclerics supported secular rulers in their conflicts with the\nChurch.\n\nThis article describes the most important sources of medieval\npolitical ideas and the work of some of the most interesting writers.\nThe main sources were the Bible, the Fathers of the Church, the\ntextbooks of canon and civil law, and the works of Aristotle,\nespecially the Politics. Sections 2 and 3 will outline what\nmedieval political thought took from the Bible and the Fathers.\nSections 4 and 5 will sketch the ideas of political thinkers of the\npre-scholastic period, including Augustine. Sections 6 and 7 will\nsketch the sources that became influential during the twelfth and\nthirteenth centuries, namely Aristotle and the law textbooks. Section\n8 will outline one of the main issues of medieval political thought\nfrom the thirteenth century onwards, namely the political power of the\npope. Section 9 will outline the work of a major thirteenth century\nwriter, Thomas Aquinas. Sections 10\u201314 will be concerned with\nwriters on political philosophy during the 14th and\n15th centuries, including Marsilius of Padua and William of\nOckham.\n2. The Bible\n\nFor medieval Christians the Bible was what we call the Vulgate, a\nLatin translation of the Old Testament (as Christians called the\nJewish scriptures) and the New\n Testament.[4]\n The Protestant reformers have persuaded many that the Bible was\nneglected during the middle ages\u2014according to Luther the Bible\n\u201chas come to lie forgotten in the dust under the bench\u201d\n(see Luther [1539] 1915: vol. 1, 7; cf.\n 2 Kings 22:8).\n However, the many copies of the Bible made during the middle ages,\nthe many commentaries on books of the Bible made by medieval scholars\nand the constant references to the Bible in their writings show that\nthe Bible was a very familiar book.\n2.1 Obedience to the Powers That Be\n\nPolitical ideas conveyed by the Bible include the following:\n\n\n\nThe human race is normally ruled by kings or emperors. There are very\nfew traces of republican institutions in the Bible. (There is one\nexception:\n 1 Machabees 8:14\u201316\n is an admiring description of Roman republican government.)\n\n\nKings are very often wicked tyrants and enemies of God. The peoples\noften share the vices of their rulers.\n\n\nThe kingship of King David is a model (though David also often\nsinned).\n\n\nSubjects must obey rulers, even the wicked. It is wrong to rebel, and\nespecially to make any attack on the person of the ruler\u2014see\n 2 Samuel 1:14\u201316.\n\n\nBut obedience to rulers is always limited by obedience to the commands\nof God.\n\n\nThe New Testament writers teach that Christians must obey their\nrulers: \n\n\nLet every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is no power but\nfrom God: and those that are, are ordained of God. Therefore he that\nresisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that\nresist, purchase to themselves damnation. \u2026 For he is\nGod\u2019s minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is\nevil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is\nGod\u2019s minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth\nevil. Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also\nfor conscience\u2019 sake.\n (Romans 13:1\u20135)\n \n\nBe ye subject therefore to every human creature for God\u2019s sake:\nwhether it be to the king as excelling; or to governors as sent by him\n\u2026 For so is the will of God.\n (1 Peter 2:13\u201315)\n \n\n\nIn the seventeenth century most Protestants and some Catholics\ninferred from these texts that subjects always have a religious duty\nto obey their rulers, reconciling this with the text \u201cWe ought\nto obey God, rather than men\u201d\n (Acts 5:29)\n by means of a doctrine of \u201cpassive\n obedience\u201d.[5]\n Some of the Fathers and the Carolingian writers held a similar\nposition, but most scholastic authors, under the influence of ideas\ndrawn partly from Aristotle and partly from the law texts, held that\nunder some circumstances disobedience and rebellion may be\njustified.\n2.2 Slavery\n\nNew Testament writers say that whether a Christian is slave or free is\na matter indifferent: \n\n\nLet every man abide in the same calling in which he was called. Wast\nthou called, being a bondman? care not for it \u2026 For he that is\ncalled in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord.\nLikewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ.\n (1 Corinthians 7:20\u201322)\n\nThere is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there\nis neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.\n (Galatians 3:28)\n \n\n\nThe ancient Cynics and\n Stoics\n also held that a slave may attain virtue and happiness, since the\nessential freedom of a human being is not incompatible with external\nconstraint.\n\nSince being a slave is a matter indifferent, Christianity did not\ncondemn slavery. Several New Testament texts exhort slaves to\nobedience (the Vulgate servi, which is normally and properly\ntranslated \u201cslaves\u201d, is in the Douai version translated\n\u201cservants\u201d): \n\n\nServants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the\ngood and gentle, but also to the froward.\n (1 Peter 2:18)\n\nServants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the\nflesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to\nChrist.\n (Ephesians 6:5;\n cf.\n Colossians 3:22)\n \n\n\nPaul wrote a letter to the Christian slave owner, Philemon, exhorting\nhim to treat well a fugitive slave \u201cwhom I have sent back to\nthee\u201d\n (Philemon 1:12).\n2.3 Property\n\n\u201cThou shalt not steal\u201d was one of the ten commandments\n (Exodus 20:15).\n Medieval writers assumed that the institution of private property was\nnormal and right and that property should be respected. However, the\nNew Testament encouraged voluntary poverty: \n\n\nJesus saith to him: If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast,\nand give to the poor\u2026Then Jesus said to his disciples: Amen, I\nsay to you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of\nheaven. And again I say to you: It is easier for a camel to pass\nthrough the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the\nkingdom of heaven.\n (Matthew 19:21\u201324;\n cf.\n Luke 18:22)\n \n\n\nThe New Testament also seemed to recommend voluntary communism as an\nideal. The early Christian community in Jerusalem \n\n\nhad but one heart and one soul: neither did any one say that aught of\nthe things which he possessed, was his own; but all things were common\nunto them. \u2026 neither was there any one needy among them. For as\nmany as were owners of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the\nprice of the things they sold, and laid it down before the feet of the\napostles. And distribution was made to every one, according as he had\nneed.\n (Acts 4:32\u201335;\n cf.\n Acts 2:44\u201345)\n \n\n\nThe leading institutions of medieval Europe included monasticism and\nother forms of religious life based on a vow of poverty and communal\nliving.\n2.4 Pacifism\n\nThe New Testament included texts that seemed to forbid Christians to\nuse force: \n\n\nBut I say to you not to resist evil: but if one strike thee on thy\nright cheek, turn to him also the other\u2026Love your enemies: do\ngood to them that hate you: and pray for them that persecute and\ncalumniate you.\n (Matthew 5:39\u201344).\n\n2.5 Christ\u2019s Kingdom\n\nMedieval Christians held that Christ was in some sense a\n king.[6]\n However, Jesus said \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world\u201d\n (John 18:36),\n and he seemed to recommend obedience to the Roman Emperor:\n\u201cRender therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s;\nand to God, the things that are God\u2019s\u201d\n (Matthew 22:21).\n None of Christ\u2019s followers would have power over the others:\n\n\n\nYou know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they\nthat are the greater, exercise power upon them. It shall not be so\namong you.\n (Matthew 20:25\u201326)\n \n\nBe not you called rabbi. For one is your master, and all you are\nbrethren. And call none your father upon earth: for one is your\nfather, who is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters: for one is\nyour master, Christ.\n (Matthew 23:8\u201310)\n \n\n\nDespite these texts the clergy accepted titles of honour and claimed\nauthority and power: the Church saw itself as Christ\u2019s kingdom\non earth, and claimed a share in Christ\u2019s power.\n\nPaul\u2019s text, \n\n\nFor what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge\nthem that are within? For them that are without, God will judge,\n (1 Corinthians 5:12\u201313)\n \n\n\nwas usually taken to imply that the Church has no jurisdiction over\nnon-Christians (\u201cthem that are without\u201d, i.e., outside the\nChurch).\n3. The Fathers of the Church\n\nThe Christian theologians of late antiquity are referred to as the\nFathers of the\n Church.[7]\n The most influential of them in medieval Europe was Augustine; others\nincluded Cyprian, Ambrose and Gregory. The Greek Fathers (Origen,\nChrysostom, etc.) were not so influential at first, but during the\nscholastic period many of their writings were translated into\n Latin.[8]\n The Fathers were influential partly through their originalia\n(i.e., their original writings in their complete text), but perhaps\nmore through extracts included in \u201cglosses\u201d on the Bible\nand in anthologies and through extensive quotations made by later\nwriters. Many of the Fathers were influenced by the Platonism and\n Stoicism\n that every educated person became acquainted with in the ancient\nworld. Augustine was particularly influenced by Platonism, in the\nversion modern scholars call\n Neoplatonism,\n and by\n Plotinus\n especially.\n\nThe Fathers passed down to the middle ages the idea that certain key\nsocial institutions were not part of God\u2019s original plan for\nmankind, namely the institutions of coercive government, slavery and\nproperty. The idea found in\n Seneca\n and other ancient Stoics of a Golden Age had a parallel in Christian\nthinking, namely the age of innocence in the Garden of Eden, from\nwhich mankind were expelled because of the sin of Adam and Eve (the\n \u201cFall\u201d).[9]\n Just as Seneca ([c. 60 CE] 1917\u201325: vol. II, 397,\nLetter 90) held that originally there would have been no need\nfor coercion, since human beings would voluntarily have accepted the\nguidance of the wise, and no need for property, since no one would\nhave sought to control more resources than they needed to support a\ntemperate way of life, and no slavery, since a slave is a human being\ntreated as property, so, according to the Fathers, these institutions\nwould not have existed if Adam had not sinned. But because of sin they\ndo exist, both as a result of sinfulness (the power-hungry and greedy\namass coercive power and property), and as a necessary and justified\nremedy for sin\u2014ideally, governments should use coercion to\nrepress wrongdoing, with slavery used only as a punishment, milder\nthan execution, for wrongdoing, and property should be of moderate\nextent, its purpose being to protect possession of necessities from\nthe greed of those who would otherwise try to control everything.\n\nThe common opinion on coercive government and slavery was expressed by\nAugustine. God \n\n\ndid not intend that \u2026[man] should have lordship over any but\nirrational creatures: not man over man, but man over the beasts.\nHence, the first just men were established as shepherds of flocks,\nrather than as kings of men. (City of God, XIX.15, p. 942;\npage references are to the translation by Dyson [1998]) \n\n\nHe goes on to say that slavery is a just punishment for sin, and that\nservi are so called because \u201cthose who might [justly]\nhave been slain under the laws of war were sometimes spared\u201d\n[servabantur].\n\nOn property, Gratian\u2019s Decretum (c. 1140) included a\npassage from Ambrose: \n\n\nBut he says, \u2018Why is it unjust if I diligently look after my own\nthings as long as I do not seize other people\u2019s? O impudent\nwords! \u2026 No one should say \u2018my own\u2019 of what is\ncommon; if more than what suffices is taken, it is obtained with\nviolence. Who is as unjust and as avaricious, as he who makes the food\n[alimenta] of the multitude not for his own use, but for his\nabundance and luxuries? The bread which you hold back belongs to the\nneedy. (D. 47 c. 8; Tierney 1959: 34) \n\n\nThus even now that property exists, things are in some sense\n\u201ccommon\u201d, and the amount of property individuals may\nlegitimately keep for their own use is limited.\n4. Augustine\n4.1 The City of God\n\nThe work of Augustine\u2019s most likely to be known to modern\nstudents of political thought is The City of God. Although\nthis work was often copied in the middle ages (382 manuscripts have\n survived),[10]\n a reading of the whole work was never part of the university\ncurriculum. Extracts from it were included in influential anthologies,\nsuch as Gratian\u2019s Decretum and Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences (c.\n 1150).[11]\n\n\nTwo cities, the city of God and the earthly city, are distinguished by\ntwo loves, love of God and (misdirected) love of self, and by two\ndestinies, heaven and hell. Augustine\u2019s most famous contribution\nto theology was the doctrine of predestination, a position that only\nbecame pronounced later in life. God has decreed from all eternity\nthat to some he will give the grace (special help) needed to attain\neternal salvation, while the rest of mankind (the majority) will go to\neternal damnation\u2014the massa damnata (City of\nGod, XXI.12, p. 1070). Salvation requires the grace of\n\u201cfinal perseverance\u201d, i.e., the grace of being in\nfriendship with God at the moment of death. Some who live well for\nmost of their lives may fall away at the very end. Thus we cannot tell\nfor sure who is predestined to salvation. Since the city of God\nconsists of those predestined to salvation, we cannot be sure of its\nmembership. The city of God is not identical with the Church, since\nnot all members of the Church will be saved. The earthly city is not\nidentical with any particular state, since some members of a state may\nbe predestined to salvation. A particular state may include citizens\nof both cities.\n\nAlthough the members of the two cities have different ultimate values,\nthey may have intermediate ends in common\u2014for example, they all\ndesire peace on earth. Insofar as any particular state serves such\ncommon ends it will have the cooperation of members of the city of God\n(City of God, XIX.17, p. 945\u20137). As a Platonist\nAugustine thought in terms of a hierarchy of levels of reality, in\nwhich lower levels imitate or reflect the higher levels.\nAugustine\u2019s is not a philosophy of \u201cblack and\nwhite\u201d, of stark opposition between the forces of light and the\nforces of darkness\u2014this was the Manichean philosophy, to which\nAugustine at one time subscribed, until the reading of certain works\nof the Platonists had led him to reject it. According to Augustine\nthere is no absolute evil (see City of God XI.22, XII.2, 3,\n7;\n Confessions VII.xii.18\u2013xiii.19;\n Enchiridion 11\u201312). Anything evil must be to some extent good, or it could\nnot exist at all. Its evil consists in disorder or misdirection, in\nits failing to attain all the goodness appropriate to it. \n\n\nThe peace of all things lies in the tranquillity of order, and order\nis the disposition of equal and unequal things in such a way as to\ngive to each its proper place. (City of God, XIX.13, p. 938)\n\n\n\nThere are many orderings and sub-orderings, and there are therefore\ndifferent kinds or levels of peace, and (for beings capable of moral\nchoice) different kinds or levels of virtue, justice and\n happiness.[12]\n\n\nTrue virtue presupposes obedience to the true God. But something like\ntrue virtue, namely love of honour, may lead to something like justice\nand peace, as it did in the Roman Republic (City of God,\nV.12). Earlier, Augustine had offered to prove that by Cicero\u2019s\ndefinition, the Romans never had a republic: \u201cI shall attempt to\nshow that no such commonwealth ever existed, because true justice was\nnever present in it\u201d (City of God II.21, p. 80; see\nalso the entry on\n ancient political philosophy\n (\u00a76. Cicero and the Roman Republic), since the Romans did not\nobey the true God (cf. XIX.21). But this is only an argumentum ad\nhominem. As Augustine says, \u201cThere was, of course,\naccording to a more practicable definition, a commonwealth of a\nsort\u201d (II.21, p. 80). It is only by an unduly narrow definition\nthat it can be said that non-Christians cannot form a commonwealth.\nMotivated by love of honour, the Romans were able to live together in\nan approximation to peace, justice and happiness, though not in\n\u201ctrue\u201d peace, justice and happiness. Justice in some\nmeasure is essential to anything that deserves to be called a\ncommonwealth. \n\n\nJustice removed, then, what are kingdoms but great bands of\nrobbers?\u2026 It was a pertinent and true answer which was made to\nAlexander the Great by a pirate whom he had seized. When the king\nasked him what he meant by infesting the sea, the pirate defiantly\nreplied: \u201cThe same as you do when you infest the whole world;\nbut because I do it with a little ship I am called a robber, and\nbecause you do it with a great fleet, you are an emperor\u201d.\n(City of God, IV.4, p. 147\u20138)\n\n\nSome medieval writers, whom some modern historians have called\n\u201cPolitical\n Augustinians\u201d,[13]\n inferred from Augustine\u2019s discussion of Cicero\u2019s\ndefinition of a republic that among non-Christians there can be no\ncommunity. According to\n Giles of Rome\n (d. 1316), among others, non-Christians can have no property rights\nand no political rights, since such things presuppose membership of a\ncommunity, and only Christians can form a true community. But the\nviews of these so-called Political Augustinians were generally\nrejected by other medieval political thinkers.\n\nWe should not infer that Augustine believed only good Christians can\nbe rulers. Nevertheless, he believes that Christian virtue, if\nobserved, makes for better government (City of God, V.24, p.\n232).\n\nAmong medieval Christians there were at least three views of the goods\nand evils of government:\n\n\n\nGovernment may be, and should be, rule by the ideal Christian ruler,\nwhom Protestants later called \u201cthe godly prince\u201d; such a\nruler would lead his people in obedience to God.\n\n\nGovernment may be simply a wicked tyranny, an expression of the\n\u201cearthly city\u201d. As Pope Gregory VII (1081) once wrote:\n\n\n\nWho does not know that kings and dukes had their rulership from those\nwho, not knowing God, strove from blind greed and intolerable\npresumption to dominate their equals, namely mankind, by pride,\nrapine, perfidy, murder, and crimes of all sorts, urged on by the\nruler of the world, i.e., the devil? (Gregory VII 1081: 552; see also\nPoole 1920: 201, fn. 5)\n\n\n\nGovernment exists to organise the cooperation of \u201cmen of good\nwill\u201d (to use a modern phrase), i.e., citizens of the two cities\nunited by an interest in earthly peace and other earthly goods valued\nby both Christians and others. Such a limited view of the goals of\ngovernment is found in Marsilius and Ockham (McGrade 1974:\n109\u201333).\n\n\nAll three views could find support in The City of God.\n4.2 Warfare\n\nAugustine insists, against the Manichees, that the God of the Old\nTestament is the same God as the God of the New Testament. One of the\nmost striking differences between the two testaments was in relation\nto warfare. In the Old Testament God permits, in fact requires, the\nIsraelites to engage in massacres. In the land God has given to the\nIsraelites, the inhabitants of a city that surrenders will be\nenslaved, but if the city resists, \u201cyou shall not leave a single\nsoul alive\u201d\n (Deuteronomy 20:11, 16).\n \u201cYou must utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with\nthem, and show no mercy to them\u201d\n (Deuteronomy 7:2).\n If in some Israelite city some inhabitants practice idolatry,\n\u201cyou shall surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword,\ndestroying it utterly, all who are in it and its cattle\u201d\n (Deuteronomy 13:16).\n Moses himself carried out a massacre of Israelites who had practiced\nidolatry\n (Exodus 32:25\u20139).\n Moses was angry when the Israelites spared women and children, and\nordered them to kill all the prisoners except the virgins, whom they\ncould keep for themselves\n (Numbers 31:13\u201318).\n Samuel was angry with Saul when the army let some animals live; for\nthat sin, God deprived Saul of the kingdom\n (1 Samuel 15).\n Samuel himself hewed a prisoner to pieces\n (1 Kings 15:32\u20133).\n In the New Testament, in contrast, Christ says: \u201cif one strike\nthee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other\u201d\n (Matthew 5:39).\n Can the New Testament be reconciled with the Old Testament? On\nAugustine\u2019s view, the two Testaments must be reconcilable, since\neverything in the Bible is true.\n\nAccording to Augustine, God may treat his creatures as he pleases, and\nthe Israelites accordingly did no wrong in carrying out God\u2019s\ncommands. (As medieval authors often put it, God is \u201clord of\nlife and death\u201d.) On the other hand, the New Testament\u2019s\napparently pacifist injunctions relate to inner attitude, rather than\nto outward act. \n\n\nThese precepts pertain rather to the inward disposition of the heart\nthan to the actions which are done in the sight of men, requiring us,\nin the inmost heart, to cherish patience along with benevolence, but\nin outward action to do what seems most likely to benefit those whose\ngood we ought to seek. ([412]\n Letter 138.2.13)[14]\n\n\n\nThose whose good we ought to seek include ourselves, and also our\nenemies, and coercion and punishment may benefit them, so we may war\nagainst them for their own good, as well as for our own. Private\nindividuals may not make war, but rulers, including Christians, may do\nso, and Christian soldiers may serve in such wars in obedience to a\nruler, even a pagan. Augustine emphasizes that both rulers and those\nwho do military service in obedience to rulers must avoid hatred,\ngreed and other dispositions incompatible with love. Although\nscattered across different texts, thanks in part to the success of the\nDecretum, Augustine offered later writers a Christianised\nversion of the Roman theory of the just\n war.[15]\n\n4.3 Coercion of Heretics\n\nIn accordance with Augustine\u2019s view of warfare, Christians were\nentitled to ask the Roman authorities, including those among them who\nwere Christian, for military protection against the violence of\nheretics and anti-Christians. But it was a further step to ask the\nauthorities to coerce heretics to convert them to orthodox\n Christianity.[16]\n At first Augustine disapproved of such coercion: \u201cA man cannot\nbelieve unless he is willing\u201d\n (Tractates on the Gospel of John, XXVI.2).\n But after a while he was persuaded and became an advocate of the use\nof force to \u201ccompel them to come in\u201d\n (Luke 14:16\u201324).[17]\n He was persuaded by converted Donatists who expressed gratitude to\nthose who had compelled them to convert\n (Letter 93 V.17\u201319).\n\nAccording to Augustine, the property of heretical sects may rightly be\nconfiscated\n (Tractates on the Gospel of John, VI.25),\n in which Augustine justifies government seizure of Donatist property.\nHe does not argue that only orthodox Christians can rightly possess\nproperty. Rather, his point is that whoever possesses property\npossesses it only by virtue of human laws made by kings and emperors.\nTherefore, if the ruler decides to confiscate the property of\nheretics, he has the right to do so. This passage, which Gratian\nquoted in the Decretum (D. 8 c. 1), was often used in the\nmiddle ages to support the doctrine that property exists only by human\nlaw. Gratian\u2019s extensive use of Augustine in the\nDecretum arguably greatly increased Augustine\u2019s\ninfluence on the topic of warfare, property, and the coercion of\nheretics (for Augustine\u2019s views on property, see MacQueen\n1972).\n5. Carolingian Political Thought\n\nThe period in the history of Latin Europe after that of the\n\u201cFathers of the Church\u201d has traditionally been called the\n\u201cdark age\u201d, because very few writings were produced then.\nIt was followed by what has sometimes been called \u201cThe\nCarolingian Renaissance\u201d, associated with the court of\nCharlemagne, toward the end of the eighth century. The political\nwriters of the ninth century\u2014e.g., Hincmar of Rheims (c.\n805/6\u201381), Rabanus Maurus (780\u2013856), Jonas of\nOrl\u00e9ans (c. 780\u2013842/3)\u2014are not household names, yet\nthey gave expression to ideas that were important throughout the rest\nof the middle ages, in particular ideas about the role of a king and\nthe difference between king and\n tyrant.[18]\n\n\nAccording to these writers, the king is in some sense a religious\nfigure (Oakley 2010: 143ff.). This meant that the king could involve\nhimself in religious matters much more than would later be acceptable\nto the medieval church, but it also meant that the king was to be\ninstructed in his duties by the clergy. Some of the writings of this\nperiod belong to what modern scholars call the \u201cmirror of\nprinces\u201d genre. An early example was written by Jonas of\nOrl\u00e9ans (1983) in about 831, which is a good example, too, of\nhow the genre was rarely limited to only discussions of the secular\n power.[19]\n Writers taught the king that he had a duty to do justice. This was\noften construed as meaning that the king had a duty to enforce and\nalso to obey the law, and the law was thought of as partly custom,\npartly royal decree, but also as something based on the consent of the\n people.[20]\n It was suggested\u2014notably, e.g., by Hincmar of Rheims\u2014that\na king might be deposed if he failed to obey the laws and lost the\nconsent of the people (Carlyle and Carlyle 1903: vol. 1,\n242\u201352).\n6. Civil and Canon Law\n\nHistorians point to another \u201crenaissance\u201d (i.e., another\nstage in the re-appropriation of the culture of antiquity) during the\ntwelfth century. This \u201crenaissance of the twelfth century\u201d\nincluded a revival in the study of civil law, i.e., the Roman law as\ncodified and digested by Justinian and his officials (the Corpus\niuris civilis, 533/4),[21]\n and this stimulated and influenced the study of canon law, beginning\nwith Gratian\u2019s\n Decretum.[22]\n\n\nIdeas that medieval political thinkers took\u2014in different ways\nand to different degrees\u2014from the law texts included the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\nA distinction among kinds of laws, namely natural law (ius\nnaturale), law of nations (ius gentium), and civil law\n(i.e., the law of a particular community). The law textbooks were\nperhaps the main source of the idea of natural law, so important to\nlater medieval political thought. This idea can be traced back to\nCicero, to the Stoics, and to Aristotle, but most medieval political\nphilosophers encountered it in Gratian\u2019s Decretum. (As\na rule, medieval theologians and philosophers evince a greater\nfamiliarity with the collections of canon law than with the Corpus\niuris civilis.)\n\n\nA notion of rights, including natural rights (\u201chuman\nrights\u201d as we would say), attributable to individuals. It is\nnoteworthy that the language of rights, without which many people\nthese days would not know how to talk about politics, did not fully\nenter political philosophy until the fourteenth century as a borrowing\nfrom the\n law.[23]\n\n\n\nA belief in \u201cthe one liberty of all men\u201d, that is, the\nidea that human beings are basically equal and that slavery is\ncontrary to natural law, though in accordance with the law of\n nations.[24]\n\n\n\nAn account, or rather two accounts, of the origin of property:\naccording to some Roman law texts, property originated by natural law;\naccording to others by the law of\n nations.[25]\n According to canon law, property exists by human law (which includes\nthe law of nations and the civil law); compare Augustine\u2019s\nstatement that property exists by the laws of the emperors\n (\u00a74.3\n above).[26] \n\n\nA canon law doctrine that human law cannot altogether abolish the\noriginal commonness of things under natural law. Property owners must\nhelp the poor (see Ambrose, end of\n \u00a73\n above), and in cases of necessity, a person may assert the natural\nright to use anything needed to sustain\n life.[27]\n\n\n\nThe doctrine that the source of political authority is the people, who\nhave, however, entrusted their power to the emperor or other\n ruler.[28]\n\n\n\nThe doctrine that either the pope or emperor (or both) has a\n\u201cfullness of power\u201d (see\n \u00a78\n below).\n\n\nThe doctrine that natural law permits an individual to resist force by\nforce (Digest 1.1.3; D. 1 c. 7, trans. in Gratian [c. 1140]\n1993: 7). This doctrine would provide a premise for arguments for the\nright to resist a tyrannical government, used later by\n Locke.\n\n\nA distinction between Church and State\u2014more exactly, between the\npriesthood and the power of the emperor, each independent in its own\nsphere, though the priesthood has the higher function. The classic\nplace for this doctrine is the canon Duo\n sunt.[29]\n Another canon, Cum ad verum, gave reasons for the\nseparation: mutual limitation of their powers would restrain the pride\nof priest and emperor, and those on God\u2019s service (the clergy)\nshould be kept free of worldly entanglements (D. 96 c. 6; translated\nin Tierney 1980: 14\u201315). This was also the force of the canons\nSicut enim and Te\n quidem.[30]\n\n\n\nVarious legal ideas relating to\n corporations[31]\n and representation (including the distinction between a head\u2019s\ncapacity as head and his private capacity), the need for meetings to\ndeal with common concerns (\u201cwhat touches everyone must be\ndiscussed and approved by\n everyone\u201d),[32]\n and majority decision (or some qualified version thereof) when there\nis no unanimity (decision by \u201cthe greater and sounder\n part\u201d).[33]\n\n\n\nOf these points, what was probably most important for medieval\npolitical philosophy was the idea of natural law.\n6.1 Natural Law and Natural Rights\n\nComplex reflections on natural law were prompted by a text of Isidore\nof Seville (quoted in D. 1 c. 7; Gratian 1993: 6\u20137). According\nto Isidore, natural law includes \n\n\nthe common possession of all things, the one liberty of all, and the\nacquisition of what is taken from air, land and sea; also, the\nrestitution of a thing or money left for safekeeping. \n\n\nThe common possession of all things seems inconsistent with the\nacquisition and restitution of property.\n\nOne of the early commentators on Gratian, Rufinus, distinguished\nwithin natural law between commands or prohibitions, to which there\ncan be no exceptions, and \u201cindications\u201d\n(demonstrationes) pointing out what is better but not always\nobligatory. Thus natural law not only lays down rules but also\nrecommends ideals. The \u201cone liberty of all men\u201d and\n\u201ccommon possession of all things\u201d belong to the\n\u201cindications\u201d. Since the indications do not impose strict\nobligations, human laws can for good reasons set them aside. To do so\nmay even serve the recommended ideals, under some circumstances. \n\n\nFor example\u2026 it was established that those who pertinaciously\nrebelled against those who have authority over them would be\nperpetually slaves when defeated and captured in war\u2026 that\n[they]\u2026 should thereafter become gentle\u2026 \n\n\n\u2014a purpose recommended by natural law (trans. Lewis 1954: vol.\n1, 38; see Tierney 2014: 23\u20138).\n\nOne of the founders of Franciscan theology, Alexander of Hales,\nreported Rufinus\u2019s distinction and a similar distinction by Hugh\nof St Victor (Alexander of Hales [c. 1240] 1948: vol. 4, 348,\n351\u20132) but also suggested another way of resolving the\ninconsistency in Isidore\u2019s list, based on Augustine\u2019s\nexplanation of how the same God can be the author of the Old Law and\nof the New: namely, that the same principles may require different\nparticular rules for different\n circumstances.[34]\n According to Alexander, Isidore\u2019s list is not inconsistent\nafter all, since natural law prescribes community for the state of\ninnocence and respect for property for the fallen\n state.[35]\n The leading Franciscan theologian of the next generation,\nBonaventure, adopted a similar\n position.[36]\n\n\nBuilding on these ideas, Ockham developed a distinction between three\nkinds of natural law, according to which some principles of natural\nlaw apply everywhere and always, some applied only in the state of\ninnocence, and some apply only \u201con supposition\u201d, viz. on\nthe supposition of some voluntary act (e.g., an agreement or an act of\nlegislation), unless those concerned agree on something else. Thus\n\u201cthe common possession of all things, the one liberty of\nall\u201d belonged to the natural law in the state of innocence, but\n\u201cthe acquisition of what is taken from air, land and sea; also,\nthe restitution of a thing or money left for safekeeping\u201d\nbelonged to natural law \u201con supposition\u201d\u2014supposing\nAdam\u2019s sin, and supposing that human law has since made a\ndivision of property, it is a requirement of natural law to respect\nothers\u2019 property (William of Ockham, Letter:\n286\u201393; commentary in Kilcullen 2001a, Tierney 2014:\n103\u201316). Many things that belong to the law of nations are also\nnatural laws of the third kind.\n\nBesides natural law, scholastic thinkers developed a notion of natural\nrights, borrowing the notion of a right from the canon lawyers. A\nnatural right may be simply something that natural law requires or\npermits. But according to some, natural rights to certain freedoms\nbelong to natural law \u201cpositively\u201d, in the sense that\nthere is a presumption in their favour, so that they cannot be\nabolished, at least not for all circumstances, or cannot be abolished\nexcept for good reasons. Medieval natural rights foreshadow modern\n\u201chuman rights\u201d (Tierney 1997; M\u00e4kinen and Korkman\n2006; M\u00e4kinen 2010; Kilcullen 2010c,d; and Robinson 2014a).\n7. Aristotle\u2019s Politics\n\nAnother aspect of the \u201crenaissance of the twelfth century\u201d\nwas the translation into Latin of many Greek and Arabic philosophical\nand scientific writings (see the section on \u201cnew\ntranslations\u201d in the entry on\n medieval philosophy).\n The market for these translations included the teachers, students and\nalumni of the urban schools, which in the early thirteenth century\nbegan to form universities. The universities set the curriculum\nfollowed in the schools of the town, and, given Aristotle\u2019s\nfame, competition for students between the schools of different towns\nsoon meant that Aristotle\u2019s works became the main element in the\nArts curriculum (despite the misgivings of the theologians, who noted\nthe conflicts between Aristotle\u2019s philosophy and Christian\nbelief).\n\nIn their interpretations of Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy and\nmetaphysics and in philosophical thinking generally, the medieval\nschools were much influenced by Muslim and Jewish thinkers. This was\nnot true, however, in political philosophy. By some accident of\ntransmission, the Islamic world does not seem to have known\nAristotle\u2019s Politics, but the Muslims did become\nacquainted with Plato\u2019s Republic\u2014which, however,\nwas not translated into Latin during the middle ages. In Arabic there\nwas a good deal of political philosophy showing the influence of Plato\n(for some information, see the entry on\n Greek Sources in Arabic and Islamic Philosophy),[37]\n but it had little or no influence over political philosophy in\nmedieval Europe.\n\nAristotle\u2019s Politics was translated into Latin for the\nfirst time in the mid-1260s by William of Moerbeke (Sch\u00fctrumpf\n2014) (An incomplete translation had been made a few years earlier,\npossibly by Moerbeke, and the Nicomachean Ethics, some parts\nof which relate to politics, had been translated by\n Robert Grosseteste\n a little earlier.) Although the Politics did not become part\nof the core curriculum, it was closely studied by many of the leading\nphilosophers of the scholastic period (Fl\u00fceler 1993). Notable\ncommentaries on the Politics were written by Thomas Aquinas\nand Peter of\n Auvergne.[38]\n Ockham drew on their commentaries to give a clear and concise summary\nof Aristotle\u2019s political theory (William of Ockham [c. 1334]\nLetter: 133\u2013143; Lambertini 2000: 269ff.). (For a\nmodern account of the work see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s political theory.)\n\nIdeas which medieval political writers took from Aristotle (or which\nAristotle reinforced) include the following:\n\nIt is natural for human beings to form cities.\n\u201cPolitical\u201d [i.e., city] life is natural to human\n kind.[39]\n On the face of it, this is in conflict with Augustine (see\n \u00a74\n above).\nThe city or state exists not just for security and trade, but to\nfoster the \u201cgood life\u201d, the life according to virtue\n (Politics III.9, 1280 a32\u2013b35).\nSome human beings are slaves \u201cby nature\u201d, i.e., there\nare, or may be, human beings marked out by nature for subordination to\nthe interests of others. Natural slaves are human beings naturally\nlacking in intelligence and in capacity to achieve virtue or\n happiness.[40]\n This conflicted with the thinking of the New Testament (see\n \u00a72.2),\n the lawyers\n (\u00a76)\n and the Stoics and the Fathers of the Church\n (\u00a73).\nWomen should, in general, be ruled by men\n (Politics I.5, 1254 b13).\n The inferiority of women was already the general opinion, but\nAristotle reinforced it, not only by what he said in the\nPolitics but also by his biological theories.\nThere are various forms of government, of which some are good and\nsome are perversions. The good forms seek \u201cthe common\ngood\u201d, i.e., the good of both ruler and ruled. The best is\nkingship, the worst\n tyranny.[41]\n \u201cThe common good\u201d became a basic conception in medieval\npolitical philosophy (Kempshall 1999; McGrade, Kilcullen, and\nKempshall 2001).\nThere is a \u201cbest\u201d regime, the form of government that\nbest fosters the common good. The \u201cideal polity\u201d was not a\ntopic of pre-Aristotelian medieval thought, but it became a common\ntheme (e.g., William of Ockham, Letter: 311\u201323; see\nBlythe 1992).\n\u201cThe rule of law\u201d is better than \u201cthe rule of\n men\u201d,[42]\n i.e., it is better to have rules impartially applied than to leave\nevery decision to the unfettered discretion of the rulers. This\naccorded with the earlier medieval idea that the difference between a\nking and a tyrant is that the king observes the law (see\n \u00a76).\nHowever, since no legislator can foresee every case that may\narise, the rule of law must be tempered by epieikeia,\n\u201cequity\u201d, the making of exceptions to general rules when\nexceptional cases arise\n (Nicomachean Ethics V.10,\n and\n Politics III.16, 1287 a23\u201328, 1287 b15\u201327).\nA good form of government must be stable, not liable to revolution\n (Politics V,\n and\n VI.5).\n Medieval Aristotelians gave some thought to precautions against the\ndegeneration of kingship into\n tyranny.[43]\n Marsilius presents Defensor pacis as a supplement to\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of the causes of revolution.\nAlthough Aristotle regarded kingship as ideally best (and medieval\nwriters agreed), Aristotle also gives an argument for\ndemocracy\u2014or, more exactly, an argument that in good government\nthere is a role for ordinary people. If ordinary people deliberate as\na body they may make sound decisions\n (Politics III.11).\n Marsilius (and others) used Aristotle\u2019s remarks to support the\nproposition that the people are the ultimate political authority, an\nidea also found in the Roman law.\nAll of Aristotle\u2019s works supported one of the central\ninstitutions of medieval university life, disputation, in which the\nmaster states opposing positions and supports them with strong\narguments, then evaluates the arguments by criticism. The practice of\ndisputing about important questions, including questions relating to\npolitics, was deeply ingrained in medieval\n culture.[44]\n\n\n8. Papal Fullness of Power\n\nSo much for the sources of medieval political philosophy and its early\nstages. Let us turn now to the contributions made by scholastic and\nlate scholastic writers, who often became involved in conflict between\nsecular rulers and the papacy.\n\nOne focus of controversy was the papal claim to \u201cfullness of\npower\u201d. Originally the claim meant that the pope had\npreeminently whatever power any other authority had within the Church,\nso that he could intervene by full right in any Church affair\n(Rivi\u00e8re 1925). Pope Innocent III (1198\u20131216), whose\ndecretals repeatedly \u201cexalted papal political power\u201d\n(Pennington 2007: 165), provided the fodder for subsequent jurists to\ndevelop the notion of papal fullness of\n power.[45]\n During the thirteenth century this conception was also invoked when\nthe pope authorised the mendicant friars to preach and perform\nreligious functions in a diocese even without the consent of the\ndiocesan bishop. Such interventions were strongly opposed by many\nsecular clerics who argued that bishops had their authority by divine\nlaw and were not merely agents of the\n pope.[46]\n\n\nDuring the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries popes also claimed the\nright to intervene in affairs normally the province of secular rulers.\nThis claim was made especially in reference to the Roman Empire. Pope\nLeo III had crowned Charlemagne as Roman Emperor in 800, and in 962\nPope John XII gave the title \u201cRoman Emperor\u201d to the German\nprince Otto I. From then until 1806 a succession of German princes\nclaimed the title. The popes took the view that they had transferred\nthe Empire from the Greeks to the Franks in the person of Charlemagne,\nand from the Franks to the Germans in the person of Otto I, thereby\nshowing that the Roman Empire was subject to the popes, and in\nparticular that the pope had a right to approve or reject the\ncandidate elected to be emperor. (The emperor was elected by the\nGerman princes who constituted the electoral college\u2014like the\npope, the emperor was a monarch chosen by an electoral college to hold\noffice for life.) The subject of the \u201ctranslation\u201d of the\nempire often became a subject of intense\n debate.[47]\n Spain, France, England and some other places rejected the authority\nof the \u201cRoman Empire\u201d, but incidents in the history of\nvarious kingdoms supported papal claims to authority over kings.\n\nBesides the historical arguments there were theological or\nphilosophical arguments. If \u201cthere is no power but from\nGod\u201d\n (Romans 13:1,\n \u00a72.1 above) and the pope is God\u2019s representative on\nearth, then it seems that power comes to Christian kings through the\npope. Medieval writers were not well acquainted with Plato\u2019s\nnotion of a \u201cphilosopher king\u201d\n (Republic, 473d),\n since very little of Plato had been translated into\n Latin,[48]\n but in effect pro-papal theologians were arguing that the pope was a\n\u201ctheologian king\u201d, an expert on the meaning of life whose\nguidance was authoritative in all matters.\n\nThe popes did not in fact wish to take on the burdens of day-to-day\ngovernment throughout the world. Their claim was that, while ruling\nwas normally the business of secular rulers, the pope could intervene\nby full right in governmental matters whenever he saw good reason to\ndo so. Canon lawyers drew up lists of circumstances in which the pope\nmight intervene (for examples, see Tierney 1980: 153\u20134), but\nsome items in the list were so comprehensive as to leave no area in\nwhich popes could not intervene. For example, intervention ratione\npeccati, \u201cby reason of sin\u201d, meant that if a secular\nruler commits an injustice (which is a sin) then the pope might\nintervene.\n\nPapal claims were opposed by secular rulers, by clerical writers who\nsaw some interest in defending the secular rulers, and by theologians\nunconvinced by the pro-papal arguments and concerned about the likely\neffects of papal encroachment. Most of the political writers of the\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries were involved in controversy about\nthe extent and limits (or absence of limits) of papal authority\n(Miethke 2000a; Oakley 2012: 173ff. and 2015: 14ff.).\n9. Thomas Aquinas\n\nThomas Aquinas wrote a work in the \u201cmirror of princes\u201d\ngenre, namely On Kingship, to the King of Cyprus, but\notherwise his political writing was incidental to his academic work,\nand not, as was the case with most medieval political writers, an\nattempt to influence contemporary events. The Summa\ntheologiae includes discussions of dominion in the state of\ninnocence, natural law and other kinds of law, property, the best form\nof government, the duty of obedience, war, coercion of heretics and\ninfidels, and other political matters. These discussions are not\norganised into a separate treatise on politics but distributed through\nthe work in accordance with its plan as a summary of\n theology.[49]\n\n\nWhereas Augustine had held that in the state of innocence there would\nhave been no lordship of man over man, Thomas says that there would\nhave been dominium [lordship] in the state of innocence\n (Summa, 1, q. 96, a. 4).\n This has sometimes been taken as a rejection of Augustine in favour\nof Aristotle\u2019s doctrine that politics is natural. However,\nThomas says that in the state of innocence there would have been no\ncoercion, but there would have been government in the sense of wise\nleadership voluntarily accepted by the less wise. This is a view found\nnot in Aristotle but in earlier Latin writers, for example Seneca (see\n \u00a73),\n and the contradiction with Augustine is merely verbal\u2014for\nAugustine dominium implies coercion, for Thomas its sense is\nbroader.\n\nOn natural law and other kinds of law Thomas again follows not\nAristotle but the tradition of civil and canon law going back to the\nRoman\n Stoics.[50]\n He distinguishes divine law (eternal and positive) from human law,\nand among human laws he distinguishes natural law from the law of\nnations and civil law (see\n Summa, 1\u20132, q. 95, a. 4).\n Law is concerned with direction to the common good, which belongs to\nthe whole people\n (Summa, 1\u20132, q. 90, a. 3).\n All positive human law must be in accordance with natural law, though\nits prescriptions will depend upon choice and circumstances (for\nexample, natural law prescribes that we must not kill, but human\npositive law makes additional rules to prevent killing, rules that may\ndepend on arbitrary choice\u2014e.g., there may be a rule requiring\nmotorists to drive on the left and not the right, or vice versa (see\n Summa, 1\u20132, q. 95, a. 2).\n Natural law is in effect morality, and according to Thomas the human\nmind, reflecting on and analysing human experience, can see the truth\nof various fundamental moral principles, which are thus\n\u201cself-evident\u201d, not in need of proof, and too fundamental\nto be capable of proof\n (Summa, 1\u20132, q. 91, a. 3,\n and\n q. 94, a. 2).[51]\n\n\nOn property, Thomas follows the view of the Stoics and the Fathers\nthat property exists by human positive law. Natural law permits us to\nuse things\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 66, a. 1),\n but property goes beyond power to use: it includes a power to exclude\nothers from use, and this power is conferred by human positive law\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 66, a. 2).\n Property rights give way to extreme need (see above), so in time of\nextreme need using another\u2019s property without permission is not\ntheft\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 66, a. 7).\n\nThe best form of government, according to Thomas, is a mixed\ngovernment combining elements of democracy, aristocracy and kingship\n (Summa, 1\u20132, q. 105, a. 1).\n This is reminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s preference for mixed\ngovernment over either democracy or oligarchy, but in fact many\nancient writers, including Cicero, advocated mixed government, and on\nthis topic Thomas is closer to Polybius\u2014whom he did not\nknow\u2014than to Aristotle (Blythe 1992: 57\u20138).\n\nOn the duty to obey government, Thomas does not adopt the position\nthat many others found in the New Testament, that disobedience is\nnever justified. According to Thomas Aquinas, though there is a\ngeneral duty to obey the law and the government, an unjust law is not\na law\n (Summa, 1\u20132, q. 96, a. 4;\n see also\n 2\u20132, q. 104, a. 5).[52]\n\n\nOn war, Thomas is an exponent of a version of the \u201cjust\nwar\u201d theory Augustine took from the ancient Romans. For a war to\nbe just, it must be commanded by someone in authority, there must be a\njust cause, and it must be carried on without disproportionate\nviolence. It is not justifiable to lie to an enemy, since that would\ndestroy the trust that will be needed to restore peace\n (see Summa, 2\u20132, q. 40, a. 1, a. 3).\n\nOn questions relating to the coercion of heretics and unbelievers,\nThomas supports the practice of the medieval Church. A heretic (i.e.,\nsomeone who has been baptised as a Catholic but has since rejected\northodox Catholic doctrine) can rightly be compelled to return to the\nChurch, but a Jew or unbeliever who has never been a Catholic should\nnot be converted by force\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 10, a. 8).\n Simple people should not be exposed to the opinions of unbelievers\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 10, a. 7, 9).\n The children of Jews should not be taken from them and brought up as\nCatholics, since this would violate natural justice, which gives\nparents control over under-age children\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 10, a. 12).\n The religious rites of Jews may be tolerated, but not those of other\nunbelievers, except to avoid strife or in hope of their gradual\nconversion\n (Summa, 2\u20132, q. 10, a. 11).\n9.1 Secular and Spiritual Power\n\nThe relationship between secular and spiritual power is discussed\nbriefly at the end of an early work, the Scripta super libros\nsententiarum (see\n 2, dist. 44, Expositio textus).\n When two authorities conflict, Thomas asks, how should we decide\nwhich to obey? He answers that if one authority originates totally\nfrom the other (as, he says, the authority of a bishop derives from\nthe pope), greater obedience in all matters is due to the originating\nauthority. If, however, both powers originate from a higher authority,\nthe higher authority will determine which of them takes precedence on\nwhich occasion. Spiritual and secular power, he says, both come from\nGod, so we should obey the spiritual over the secular only in matters\nwhich God has specified, namely matters concerning the salvation of\nthe soul, and in civic matters we should obey the secular power\u2014\n\n\n\nunless spiritual and secular power are joined in one person, as they\nare in the pope, who by God\u2019s arrangement holds the apex of both\nspiritual and secular powers. \n\n\nIn other words, the pope has supreme authority in both secular and\nspiritual matters.\n\nIn De regno Thomas constructs an Aristotelian teleological\nargument to the same conclusion. A polity has an end, purpose or goal,\nwhich may be sought in a variety of ways, effectively or not, and it\nis a composite entity consisting of many individuals with their own\nindividual purposes. For both reasons there is needed some directing\nagency to guide the potentially conflicting individuals effectively to\ntheir common goal. Every being is in some way one; a composite entity\nhas a unity of order, i.e., of direction to a single end. In\npreserving its being, therefore, the directing agency has to preserve\nthe polity in peace and unity by ordering it to a common goal. There\nis a hierarchy of goals, that is, there are intermediate ends which\nare also means to higher ends. A polity exists to secure its\ncitizens\u2019 lives, but above living there is living well, i.e.,\nvirtuously, and above that there is living so as to attain the\n\u201cbeatific vision\u201d of God (the Christian heaven). If all\nthese ordered ends were attainable simply by human effort, the one\nsupreme directing agency would be concerned with them all; however, to\nattain the beatific vision requires \u201cgrace\u201d, i.e.,\nGod\u2019s special help, which natural human activity cannot earn.\nBesides the state, humanity therefore needs the Church, a human agency\nGod has established to confer grace through the sacraments. Hence\nthere is a distinction between secular government, which uses\nnaturally available means to guide citizens to their final goal, and\necclesiastical government, which uses supernatural means, the\nsacraments. Secular rulers must be subject to the pope, \u201cfor\nthose to whom pertains the care of intermediate ends should be subject\nto him to whom pertains the care of the ultimate end\u201d.\n\nFor more detail see the section on Political Community in the entry on\n Aquinas\u2019s moral, political and legal philosophy.\n10. Giles of Rome\n\nPhilip IV, King of France (1285\u20131314), was one of the most\nruthless of medieval rulers. He came into conflict with Pope Boniface\nVIII (1294\u20131303), one of the most arrogant of medieval popes,\nand with Pope Clement V (1305\u20131314), one of the most timid.\nClement acquiesced in Philip\u2019s attack on the Templar Order and\nother outrages to evade the king\u2019s pressure to condemn his\npredecessor, Boniface, as a heretic. These conflicts gave rise to a\nbody of writings of great interest to the history of political\n thought.[53]\n Of these the most important were Giles of Rome\u2019s De\necclesiastica potestate (On Ecclesiastical\n Power)[54]\n and John of Paris\u2019s De potestate regia et papali\n(On Royal and Papal Power), both c.\n 1302,[55]\n respectively an assertion of supreme papal power and an attempt to\nrestate the dualism of Duo sunt (see\n \u00a76\n and\n note 29).\n\nGiles argues that the pope\u2019s fullness of power extends to\npolitical matters, so that the pope is the supreme ruler of the world,\nGod\u2019s deputy on earth, who delegates power to governments and\nsupervises their activities. Giles\u2019s term for governmental power\nis dominium, which was also a term for property; Giles\nassimilates the two kinds of dominium, so that he holds that\nthe pope is also the supreme owner. He supports his position with many\narguments, of which the following two are perhaps most significant.\n(1) He appeals to the idea that the universe is a single unity with a\nhierarchical ordering in which the pope is the supreme hierarch among\nmankind: there are two swords, but the temporal sword must be subject\nto the spiritual, i.e., secular rulers must be subject to the\n pope.[56]\n (2) He applies Augustine\u2019s discussion of the question whether\nthe Romans had a true republic (see\n \u00a74.1)\n to argue that no one who does not submit to Christ\u2019s\ndominium, and therefore to the dominium of the pope\nas Christ\u2019s vicar, can have any just dominium himself.\nAs Augustine said, property is possessed by the laws of emperors and\nkings\n (\u00a74.3),\n which presupposes the authority of a community: so, Giles argues,\nsince people who fail to honour the true God cannot belong to a\ncommunity, only members of the community of the faithful can have any\nright to political power or\n property.[57]\nJohn Wyclif (c. 1330\u201384) later took these arguments further to\nthe conclusion that no sinner, indeed only the predestined, can have\nany just dominium, a doctrine condemned by the Council of\nConstance. The thesis that only Christians can have lordship was\ninconsistent with the theological tradition and was generally\n rejected.[58]\n\n\nGiles of Rome may have had a hand in drafting Boniface\u2019s\ndocument Unam sanctam (see\n Other Internet Resources),\n generally regarded as the most extreme statement of papal authority.\nWhether he drafted it or not, the ideas and language of Unam\nsanctam are reminiscent of Giles\u2019s work (see Ubl 2004).\n11. John of Paris\n\nJohn of Paris (d. 1306) reasserts the traditional distinction between\nownership and\n rulership.[59]\n The fact that a ruler adjudicates property disputes does not make him\nsupreme owner. A community (a state, or the Church, or particular\ncommunities) acquires property only from individuals, and the head of\nthe community is the administrator of the community\u2019s property,\nnot its owner. This is true also of the pope, who does not have\nunrestricted power over Church property, still less over the\nproperties of lay people\n (96\u2013105).[60]\n John\u2019s assumption that original appropriation is by\nindividuals, and his remark that individuals acquire property by\n\u201clabour and industry\u201d (86, 103), have led to suggestions\nthat he anticipated Locke\u2019s theory of property. However, John\nindicates that individuals acquire property under human law (148, 154,\n 225\u20136),[61]\n which is the view traditional among medieval theologians, following\nAugustine (see\n \u00a74.3).\n Property is acquired under human law, but it is acquired by\nindividuals, not directly by rulers.\n\nAs for rulership, John argues that the pope cannot be the supreme\ntemporal ruler because the spiritual and temporal powers should be\nheld by different persons. John gives the traditional reasons (see\n \u00a76),\n emphasizing the argument that the priest should be exclusively\ndevoted to spiritual affairs (117\u20138). The temporal power is not\nestablished by, or in any way caused by, the spiritual power. Both\ncome from God, but neither comes through the other. The spiritual is\nin some sense superior, but not as being the cause of the temporal\npower (93, 192). The basis of the distinction between the two powers\nis not subject matter or ends, but means. Each power is limited to its\nown appropriate means of action; the secular power uses natural means,\nthe Church uses supernatural means (142\u201361). This is very much\nlike Thomas Aquinas\u2019s picture of two powers leading mankind\ntoward the goals of human life in ordered hierarchy, one using natural\nmeans and the other supernatural. Thomas infers from the fact that the\nChurch is concerned with the highest end the conclusion that the pope\nought to direct the secular ruler (see above,\n \u00a79.1).\n John explicitly rejects this line of argument. Teaching is a\nspiritual function, but in a household the teacher does not direct the\nphysician. The physician exercises a higher art than the pharmacist,\nbut, though the physician guides the pharmacist, he cannot give\nauthoritative directions or dismiss the pharmacist. Such officials in\na great household do not direct one another, but are all under the\ndirection of the head of the family. Similarly both pope and prince\nderive their authority from God, who sets the limits of their power,\nand he has not subordinated one to the other (182, 184\u201393).\n12. Marsilius of Padua\n\nAnother upsurge in writing about politics was prompted by the actions\nof Pope John XXII (r. 1316\u201334). John\u2019s opponents included\nMarsilius of Padua and William of Ockham. Pope John rejected the\nFranciscan doctrine that those who practice the highest form of\nreligious poverty, like Christ and the Apostles, will own nothing\nwhatever, either as individuals or as a body. Relying on arguments\ndrawn from the civil law, John held that no one can justly use\nconsumables, such as food, without owning what they use. Since no one\ncan live without using things, at least food, no one can justly live\nwithout property, as the Franciscans claimed to do (Robinson 2012:\n29ff.; Miethke 2012). John also became involved in conflict with\nLudwig of Bavaria. Relying on the papal claim that the emperor-elect\nrequires papal approval, John rejected the electors\u2019 choice of\nLudwig as Roman Emperor (see\n \u00a78;\n Lambertini 2012).\n\nMarsilius of Padua\u2019s Defensor pacis\n (1324)[62]\n set out to refute the doctrine of papal fullness of power and, in\nparticular, to prove that the pope is not the source of government\npower. He argues that all coercive power comes from the people\n(44\u20139, 61\u20133/65\u201372, 88\u201390), and that no people\ncan have more than one supreme ruler, who is the source of all\ncoercive power in that community (80\u20136/114\u201322). (Marsilius\nis the first exponent of the doctrine of sovereignty later put forward\nby Hobbes and many others, i.e., the doctrine that there must be\nultimately just one coercive power in a state.) The supreme ruler\ncannot be a cleric, since Christ has forbidden the clergy to become\ninvolved in temporal affairs (113\u201340/159\u201392). And the\nsupreme ruler does not enforce divine law as such, since God wills\nthat divine law should be enforced by sanctions only in the next\nworld, to give every opportunity for repentance before death (164,\n175\u20139/221, 235\u20139). The supreme ruler is therefore not an\nenforcer of religion and his rule is not subject to direction by the\nclergy. Within the Church, the pope has from Christ no more authority\nthan any other cleric. Christ did not appoint Peter as head of the\nChurch, Peter never went to Rome, the bishop of Rome is not\nPeter\u2019s successor as head of the Church (44\u20139/61\u20133).\nAs for religious poverty, Marsilius sides with the Franciscans and\ntakes their doctrine further: not only is it legitimate for religious\nto live entirely without ownership of property (they can use what they\nneed with the owner\u2019s permission), but this is what Christ\nintended for all the clergy (183\u20134, 196\u2013215/244\u20136,\n262\u201386). Thus on his view the pope and clergy should have no\nlordship at all, either in the sense of coercive jurisdiction or in\nthe sense of ownership of property. His position is diametrically\nopposite that of Giles of Rome.\n\nMarsilius did believe that the Church exercised some authority over\nits members, but, so far as this was a doctrinal authority, it was\nexercised not by the pope but by a general council (Marsilius held\nthat the Bible and general councils are infallible, but not the pope\n(274\u20139/360\u201366)). Now that Europe is Christian a general\ncouncil cannot be convened or its decisions enforced except by the\nChristian lay ruler (287\u201398/376\u201390). The establishment of\na hierarchy and the division of the Church into bishoprics and other\nacts of Church government are also done by authority of the lay ruler.\nRather than secular government being subordinated to the Church, the\nChurch is subordinated to the secular government in all that concerns\ncoercive\n power.[63]\n\n13. William of Ockham\n\nWhen his authorship of Defensor pacis was discovered,\nMarsilius hastily left Paris and took refuge at the court of Ludwig of\nBavaria in Munich. Not long afterwards a number of dissident\nFranciscans also took refuge in Munich, among them William of Ockham.\nFrom about 1332 until his death in 1347 Ockham wrote a series of books\nand pamphlets, now usually called his political writings, arguing that\nPope John XXII and his successor Benedict XII ought to be deposed.\n13.1 Property\n\nIn the first of these, the Work of Ninety Days, Ockham\ndefended against Pope John XXII the Franciscan claim that the highest\nform of religious poverty is to live without property or any other\nright enforceable by a human court. John had argued that no one can\njustly consume something without owning it. Marsilius and others had\nanswered that we can justly consume things we don\u2019t own if we\nhave the owner\u2019s permission. It was objected that permission\nconfers a right, and permission to consume transfers ownership. Ockham\nanswers by means of a distinction between natural rights and legal\n rights.[64]\n In the state of innocence ownership would have been contrary to\nnatural law because everyone had a natural right to use any thing\n(27.80\u20133, 313), but after the Fall natural law gave (or God\ngave) to human communities the right to enact human law assigning\n property,[65]\n i.e., assigning to individuals or groups the right to exclude others\nfrom using certain\n things.[66]\n This law binds morally, since we must respect agreements. Thus the\ninstitution of property morally \u201cties\u201d or impedes the\nnatural right to use things, so that in ordinary circumstances we\ncannot justly use another\u2019s things. However, the original\nnatural right is not altogether abolished; on some occasions we can\nstill exercise it. For example, if an object is unappropriated, we can\nuse it without asserting property rights over it. In circumstances of\nextreme need, we can use another\u2019s property to sustain life.\nEven outside a situation of necessity, we can use another\u2019s\nproperty with the owner\u2019s permission, not only to preserve life\nbut for any legitimate purpose. Permission sometimes confers a legal\nright, but sometimes the person giving permission does not intend to\ngive, nor does the person granted the permission intend to accept, any\nright enforceable in a human court; in such a case, if the permission\nis withdrawn, for good reason or not, the person who previously had\npermission has no legal remedy. Such permission to use property does\nnot confer ownership or any other legal right, or any new right of any\nkind, but merely \u201cunties\u201d the natural right to use. The\nnatural right is enough to make use, even consumption, just. The\nFranciscans can therefore justly use and consume things that belong to\nothers without having any legal rights, relying on the natural right\nto use untied by the owner\u2019s\n permission.[67]\n\n\nEchoes of the debate over property continued to reverberate down the\ncenturies, thanks in part to the inclusion of several of Pope John\nXXII\u2019s bulls in what became the Corpus iuris canonici.\nNotable figures in this regard include\n Richard FitzRalph,\n John Wyclif, Conrad Summenhart (Varkemaa 2012), Fernando\nV\u00e1zquez de Menchaca (1572 [post.]),\n Francisco Su\u00e1rez\n (1548\u20131617),\n Hugo Grotius,\n Samuel Pufendorf, and\n Locke.\n (See also Kilcullen 2001b.)\n13.2 Papal Power Limited\n\nSoon Ockham began to write about the conflict between John and the\nRoman Empire, and, like Marsilius, he saw the papal claim to fullness\nof power as the root of many\n evils.[68]\n Unlike Marsilius, however, he did not reject the idea of papal\nfullness of power in every sense. Against Marsilius (whom he quotes\nextensively on this\n topic),[69]\n Ockham defended the traditional belief that Christ appointed Peter as\nhead of the Church, and he held that the pope, as Peter\u2019s\nsuccessor, has supreme power in the Church. The pope and other clergy\nmust not become involved in secular affairs, regularly, but in\nexceptional circumstances, Ockham says, when no lay person is able or\nwilling to take the lead in some matter necessary to the welfare of\nthe Christian community, the pope may intervene in secular matters.\nThis is an application of Aristotle\u2019s notion of\nepieikeia (see\n \u00a77).\n The pope\u2019s regular power in religious matters and occasional\npower to intervene in secular matters justify the traditional\nascription to the pope of fullness of power. However, this fullness of\npower is not omnipotence. Not only must the pope respect the moral law\nand the teachings of the Church, but he must also respect rights based\non human law and compact, and he must respect the Gospel liberty of\n Christians.[70]\n A pope who oversteps these bounds may be deposed; indeed, if his\naction involves heresy, he is deposed ipso facto\u2014and\naccording to Ockham, Popes John XXII and Benedict XII were\n heretics.[71]\n\n13.3 Secular Power also Limited\n\nBesides disagreeing with Marsilius over the status of Peter and the\nextent of the pope\u2019s power, Ockham rejected his thesis that a\ncommunity cannot be well governed unless all coercive power is\nconcentrated in one sovereign authority (Octo quaestiones\n3.3, in Letter: 309ff.) Ockham argues that, on the contrary,\nsuch concentration is dangerous and incompatible with freedom. Just as\nhe had argued that the extreme version of the doctrine of papal\nfullness of power would make Christians the pope\u2019s slaves,\ncontrary to the gospel liberty, so he argues that the corresponding\ndoctrine of fullness of power for the emperor would be incompatible\nwith the best form of government, in which subjects are free persons\nand not slaves. Accordingly, Ockham argues for limitations on the\npower of the secular ruler. He glosses the famous absolutist texts of\nthe Roman law (see above\n \u00a76\n and\n note 28).\n That the emperor is \u201creleased from the laws\u201d (legibus\nsolutus) is not true, because he is bound not only by natural and\ndivine law but also by the law of nations (a branch of human positive\nlaw), according to which some are not slaves but\n free.[72]\n \u201cWhat pleases the prince has the force of law\u201d, but only\nwhen it is something reasonable and just for the sake of the common\ngood and when this is manifestly expressed\n (3.2 Dialogus 2.26\u201328).\n13.4 Rights of the Community\n\nAccording to the canon \u201cIus civile\u201d (D. 1 c. 8),\n\u201cCivil law is the law proper to itself that each people or city\nestablishes, for divine and human reason\u201d. Ockham took this as a\nstatement of a natural right belonging to each \u201cfree\u201d\ncommunity, i.e., one not already under government, to establish its\nown law and its own\n government.[73]\n This right exists by natural law in the third sense\n (\u00a76.1\n above), i.e. \u201con supposition\u201d, namely on the supposition\nthat the community needs law and government. This is true of every\ncommunity after the Fall. After the Fall natural law gave (or God\ngave) the human race the power to establish both property and\ngovernment; God gave these powers not only to believers but also to\nunbelievers. A particular community exercises the power to establish\ngovernment by choosing a ruler and a form of government; the\nruler\u2019s power therefore comes from God, but also \u201cfrom the\npeople\u201d, i.e. from the community. But although power comes to\nthe ruler by the community\u2019s agreement, disagreement is not\nenough to remove it: the ruler has a right to the power the community\nhas conferred as long as he exercises it properly, and he cannot\nnormally be corrected or removed. But in exceptional circumstances, if\nthe ruler becomes a tyrant, or if there is some other pressing reason\nin terms of the common good, the community can depose its ruler or\nchange its form of government (Breviloquium 6.2; trans.\nShort Discourse: 158\u201363; Octo questiones 3.3,\nin Letter, 310\u201311; Miethke 2004). This is true also of\nthe Church. Although Christ gave headship in the Church to Peter and\nhis successors, each Christian community has power by natural law to\nelect its own head. The Christian community can depose a wicked pope\nand could perhaps even change the constitution of the Church, at least\ntemporarily, from the papal monarchy Christ established to some other\nform\n (3.2 Dialogus 3. 6;\n 3.1 Dialogus 2.20\u201328; in Letter: 290\u20133, 171\u2013203).\n\nAccording to Paul, \u201cthere is no power but from God\u201d\n (Romans 13:1),\n and according to a gloss on a canon from the Decretum, the\nemperor\u2019s power is \u201cfrom God alone\u201d (D. 96 c. 11,\ns.v. \u201cdivinitus\u201d). Ockham quotes these texts, and says\nthat although the secular ruler\u2019s power is \u201cfrom the\npeople\u201d, yet it is also \u201cfrom God alone\u201d, and not\nonly indirectly (i.e., from God as ultimate cause) but directly,\n\u201cwithout intermediary\u201d. These propositions are not\nobviously reconcilable. In a work apparently not circulated during the\nmiddle ages, the Breviloquium, Ockham tries to reconcile\nthem: political power comes from God, but God confers it on the ruler\nselected the community; once rulership has been conferred, the ruler\nis subject to God alone\u2014regularly, though on occasion a\ncommunity can correct or depose its ruler (Breviloquium\n4.2\u20138; Short Discourse: 110\u201321;\nPotest\u00e0 1986).\n13.5 Freedom of Discussion within the Church\n\nIn part I of his Dialogus, books\n 3\n and\n 4\n (c. 1334) Ockham discusses heresy and heretics, arguing that for\nsomeone to be a heretic it is not enough that something that person\nbelieves is heresy, he or she must also believe it\n\u201cpertinaciously\u201d, and to discover pertinacity it is often\nnecessary to enter into discussion to find whether the person is ready\nto abandon the error when it is shown to be such. For example, a\nlayperson who believes undogmatically a doctrine that is in fact\nheresy, until it has been shown to be heresy in a way adapted to that\nperson\u2019s understanding, may maintain it \u201ca thousand\ntimes\u201d, even in the face of contradiction by bishop or pope,\nwithout being a heretic\n (1 Dialogus 4.23).\n On the other hand, a pope who tries to impose a false doctrine on\nothers is known to be pertinacious precisely from the fact that he is\ntrying to impose false doctrine on others, and a pope who becomes a\nheretic automatically ceases to be pope. Thus ordinary Christians (or\na pope arguing as a theologian and not purporting to exercise papal\nauthority) can argue for a heresy as long as they are open to evidence\nand make no attempt to impose their belief on others, whereas a pope\nwho tries to impose a heresy immediately ceases to be pope and loses\nall authority. Christians must defend dissidents who are upholding a\nposition that may possibly be the truth against a possibly heretical\npope, until the uncertainty is resolved by discussion. This is an\nargument for freedom of discussion within the Church, though not for\ntoleration in general (McGrade 1974: 47\u201377; McGrade, Kilcullen,\nand Kempshall 2001: 484\u201395; Kilcullen 2010a).\n14. The Conciliar Movement\n\nIn 1378 some of the cardinals who had elected Pope Urban VI met again\nand elected another pope, claiming that their earlier choice had been\ncoerced. This was the beginning of the Great Western Schism. Various\npossible solutions were debated. One proposal was to call a General\nCouncil of the Church to end the schism. To this it was objected that\nonly a pope could call a council and that its decisions needed papal\nconfirmation. The prominent French churchman and academic, Jean Gerson\n(1363\u20131429), argued that such requirements were a matter of\nhuman ecclesiastical law, which should be set aside if it impedes the\nreformation of the Church. The arguments of Gerson and others\nprevailed, and the schism was in the end healed by a council. The\nCouncil of Constance, 1414\u20131418, deposed two rival popes (by\nthen there were three, one of whom resigned) and elected a new pope.\nThe Council also passed the decrees Sacrosancta (otherwise\ncalled Haec Sancta), which claimed that a council has power\nover a pope in all matters pertaining to faith and the reformation of\nthe Church and in particular the present\n schism,[74]\n and Frequens, which required the calling of a council every\nten years (both in\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nThe conciliarists were those who argued that, at least in\nextraordinary circumstances, a council could be called, if necessary\nwithout papal permission, to deal with schism, with authority over\neven a true pope. They included Pierre d\u2019Ailly, Jean Gerson,\nHenry of Langenstein, John Maior, Jaques Almain, Nicholas of Cusa, and\nothers. They argued that every corporation has the power to take the\nmeasures that may be necessary if its survival is endangered by\nfailure in its head. The Church must be able to deal with situations\nin which the papacy is vacant or uncertain or corrupt; otherwise its\nexistence would be more precarious than the existence of a secular\nbody politic, which can replace its head if necessary. The analogy\nbetween the Church and a secular body politic ran through much\nconciliarist thinking.\n\nAs the conciliar movement developed, some argued, more radically, that\neven in ordinary circumstances the judgment of a council prevailed\nover that of a pope. Later popes (though they owed their position to\nConstance) opposed conciliarism, at least in its more radical form,\nand warned secular rulers that conciliarist ideas also threatened the\npower of kings\u2014they were aware of the analogy between\nconciliarist views of church government and anti-monarchical views of\nsecular government. The analogy was also noticed by some of those who\nwrote during the quarrel between Parliament and the King in\nseventeenth-century England (Oakley 1962: 3\u201311). Despite its\npossible anti-monarchical implications, the notion that the pope was\nsubordinate to a council remained attractive to the French monarchy,\nand in France conciliarism was one of the sources of Gallicanism.\n\nThere were a number of strands in conciliarist thought. One important\ninfluence was the tradition of canon law, in which it had been\nacknowledged that a pope could be judged and deposed if he became a\nheretic or notorious sinner (Tierney 1955). Ockham had likewise argued\nthat \u201con occasion\u201d anyone able to do so could rightly do\nwhatever was necessary to preserve the Church, for example by deposing\na pope who had become a heretic or notorious sinner. An unacknowledged\ninfluence was Marsilius, who had argued that the ultimate authority in\nthe Church was the Christian people, that councils should be convened\nby the secular ruler and that a council could not err in matters of\n faith.[75]\n Many conciliarists held that Christ\u2019s commission\n (Mark 16:15,\n \u201cGo ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every\ncreature\u201d) was primarily to the Church as a whole, and held\neither that the authority of the whole Church is vested in the pope,\nor in the council when papal power is obstructed or abused, or else\nthat the authority of the whole Church is normally vested in a council\n(while a council is in session). On either view, the council could\ndepose an unsatisfactory pope, but on the second view the council is\nthe chief organ of Church authority even in normal circumstances.\nOckham\u2019s view was that the normal constitution of the Church is\nmonarchical (according to Ockham, Christ had appointed Peter as sole\nhead of the Church), and a council or indeed someone else may acquire\npower over a pope, or in place of a pope, only in exceptional\n circumstances.[76]\n\n15. The Medieval Tradition of Political Philosophy\n\nAlthough political philosophy was not part of the core curriculum in\nthe universities, and although the writings surveyed above were\ngenerally not produced with the idea of contributing to a\nphilosophical discipline, by the end of the middle ages the discipline\nof political philosophy (or political theology) had attained\nself-consciousness and a sense of constituting a tradition. Manuscript\ncopies of political writings by different authors were often bound\ntogether as volumes (Ouy 1979). There was a readership to which such\nworks could be addressed (Miethke 1980, 2000b). Su\u00e1rez and\nother late scholastic writers gave an outline of the history of a\nproblem and surveyed what others had said about it. In the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries a number of collections of political\nwritings were published, e.g., by Dupuy (1655) and Goldast\n (1611\u20134).[77]\n Early modern writers such as Hooker, Grotius, Hobbes, and Locke could\neasily find the works of at least some writers who had written on\npolitics during the middle ages or would know of their ideas at least\nby\n hearsay.[78]\n\n\nIf there is a theme to this history, it is perhaps the development of\npolitical\n liberalism,\n though, to be sure, ideals of\n constitutionalism\n (see, e.g., Tierney 1982, Pennington 1993a, Lee 2016),\n civic humanism,\n and\n republicanism\n (on these last two, see, e.g., Skinner 1978; Hankins 2000) may be\nfound among different medieval\n authors.[79]\n The liberal trend was helped, perhaps paradoxically, by the close\ninterweaving of religion with other threads of medieval life. This\nmeant not only that religion influenced all aspects of life, but also,\nreciprocally, that the other departments of life influenced religious\nthinking. The influence of the Roman Law and Aristotle, and of the\nculture of late antiquity familiar to the Fathers of the Church, also\nmeant that ideas originating outside the framework of the Christian\nreligion had an impact on religious thinking. The duality between\nkingship and priesthood (perhaps originally due merely to the fact\nthat Christians had no political power), and the conflicts that\nresulted from that duality, meant that religious thinking had to\naccommodate the concerns of powerful people who were not officials in\nthe religious institutions.\n\nFrom the time of Constantine, and in the west especially from the time\nof Augustine, Christians practiced the coercion of heretics and the\nrepression of unbelief. However, their regime was never completely\nrepressive. Among medieval political philosopher-theologians there was\nalways some acknowledgment of the rights of unbelievers (e.g., of the\nrights of Jewish parents, the Church\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over\n\u201cthose without\u201d, the property rights of unbelievers).\nThere was a recognition of the duty to reason and persuade (\u201cA\nman cannot believe unless he is willing\u201d). In social relations\nthere was a belief in an underlying liberty and equality, and a belief\nthat originally government and slavery did not exist, an idea that\ngovernment, law, and property arose by \u201cpact\u201d or custom,\nand an idea that originally government belonged to \u201cthe\npeople\u201d and was entrusted to rulers by the consent of the\npeople. These beliefs were akin to the modern liberal presumption in\nfavour of personal liberty. There was a belief in the \u201crule of\nlaw\u201d, in a distinction between good government and tyranny, in\n\u201cnatural rights\u201d. There was a belief in limited government\n(see Ockham in\n \u00a713.3)\n and in a distinction (not yet a separation) between Church and State.\nConcerning the constitution of the Church, a strong claim for\nunfettered papal power was made by some popes and their supporters,\nbut this was strongly resisted by writers who argued that a heretic or\nsinful pope, including one who violated the rights of the laity and of\nunbelievers, could be deposed. Something like freedom of speech was\nembodied in the practice of disputation. Ockham explicitly advocated\nfree discussion of disagreements among Christians. Where all this\nstill fell short of political liberalism was the absence of any\nargument for equal freedom of all religions. Locke,\n Bayle,\n and others in the seventeenth century advocated toleration, though\nnot for Catholics, since Catholics themselves rejected equal freedom\nof religion and were dangerous to others.\n\nThe arguments of medieval political philosophers are only partly\navailable in modern political philosophy. Non-believers cannot make\nmuch use of arguments with theological premises. But even for us,\nthere is perhaps some value in the reminder that, under some\ncircumstances, a religious tradition is capable of\ndeveloping\u2014not only in response to external pressure but even\nout of its own resources\u2014in the direction of peace and\ncooperation between members of the two cities.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["General Surveys and Overviews", "Anthologies of Translations", "Individual Authors in Translation", "Latin Editions of Principal Works", "General Bibliography"], "cat_ref_text": {"General Surveys and Overviews": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Burns, J.H.
