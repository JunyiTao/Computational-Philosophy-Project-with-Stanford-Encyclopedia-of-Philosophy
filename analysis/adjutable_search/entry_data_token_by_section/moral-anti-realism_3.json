    "main_text": "Arguing For and Against Moral Anti-realism || Noncognitivism\n3.1 Noncognitivism\n\nOn the face of it, when we make a public moral judgment, like\n\u201cThat act of stealing was morally wrong,\u201d what we are\ndoing is asserting that the act of stealing in question instantiates a\ncertain property: moral wrongness. This raises a number of extremely\nthorny metaethical questions: What kind of property is moral\nwrongness? How does it relate to the natural properties instantiated\nby the action? How do we have epistemic access to the property? How do\nwe confirm whether something does or does not instantiate the\nproperty? (And so on.) The difficulty of answering such questions may\nlead one to reject the presupposition that prompted them: One might\ndeny that in making a moral judgment we are engaging in the assignment\nof properties at all. Such a rejection is, roughly speaking, the\nnoncognitivist proposal. (See entry for\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.)\n\nIt is impossible to characterize noncognitivism in a way that will\nplease everyone. Sometimes it is presented as a view about mental\nstates and sometimes about moral language. This is because it is a\nclaim about \u201cmoral judgments,\u201d and we can consider moral\njudgments either as private mental acts or as public utterances. If we\nare thinking of moral judgments as mental states, then noncognitivism\nis the claim that moral judgments are not beliefs. If we are thinking\nof moral judgments as speech acts, then noncognitivism is the view\nthat moral judgments do not express beliefs\u2014i.e., it is\nthe view that moral judgments are not assertions. Here, for brevity,\nthe latter formulation will be preferred.\n\nIf moral judgments are not assertions, then what are they? Here the\ndifferent kinds of answers give rise to different forms of\nnoncognitivism. Ayer, as was mentioned earlier, maintained that when\nwe make a moral judgment we are expressing certain feelings, such as\napproval or disapproval. Another influential kind of noncognitivism\ncalled \u201cprescriptivism\u201d claims that moral judgments are\nreally veiled commands whose true meaning should be captured using the\nimperative mood: Someone who says \u201cStealing is morally\nwrong\u201d is really saying something like \u201cDon\u2019t\nsteal!\u201d (see Carnap 1935: 24\u201325). R.M. Hare (1952, 1963)\nrestricted this to commands that one is willing to universalize.\n\nIf noncognitivism is defined as the negation of cognitivism\u2014as a\ntheory about what moral judgments are not\u2014then the two theories\nare not just contraries but contradictories. However, a degree of\nbenign relaxation of criteria allows for the possibility of\n\u201cmixed\u201d theories. If we consider noncognitivism not as a\npurely negative thesis, but as a range of positive proposals (such as\nthose just mentioned), then it becomes possible that the nature of\nmoral judgments combines both cognitivist and noncognitivist elements.\nFor example, moral judgments (as speech acts) may be two\nthings: They may be assertions and ways of issuing commands.\n(By analogy: To call someone a \u201ckraut\u201d is both to assert\nthat they are German and to express a derogatory attitude toward\npeople of this nationality.) C.L. Stevenson held such a mixed view\n(1944); for modern versions, see Copp 2001; Schroeder 2009; Svoboda\n2011.\n\nAs mentioned, one of the major attractions of noncognitivism is that\nit is a means of sidestepping a number of thorny puzzles about\nmorality. In addition, there are several features of morality that, it\nhas been argued, the noncognitivist can accommodate more readily than\nthe cognitivist. Here are three.\n\nFirst, it has often been argued that noncognitivism does a good job of\naccounting for the motivational efficacy of moral judgment. If, when I\nsay \u201cStealing is morally wrong,\u201d I am expressing my\ndisapproval of stealing, and if disapproval is a motivation-engaging\nstate, then it seems to follow that when I sincerely judge that\nstealing is morally wrong, I will also be motivated not to steal. By\ncontrast, if a Humean view of psychology is accepted, according to\nwhich beliefs alone can never motivate, then the cognitivist must\nallow that moral judgment alone cannot motivate; it requires\nthe presence of certain desires as well. A number of philosophers have\nargued that the cognitivist view of moral motivation seems inadequate\n(Smith 1994; Toppinen 2004; see also Carbonell 2013). See entry for\n moral motivation.\n\nSecond, it has been argued that moral disagreements have certain\nqualities that are accommodated better by the noncognitivist than the\ncognitivist. The fact that moral disagreements are often both vehement\nand seemingly intractable, for example, might be taken as evidence\nthat what is really going on is a clash of emotional attitudes rather\nthan a clash of beliefs (Stevenson 1948; Gibbard 1992; Blackburn\n1998).\n\nThird, it has often been observed that we are markedly uncomfortable\nwith the idea that anyone should come to hold a moral view on the\nbasis of having deferred to an expert on morality\u2014in contrast to\nthe way that we are perfectly comfortable with the idea that a person\nshould defer to experts when forming beliefs about, say, plate\ntectonics. This reluctance to defer to experts in forming our moral\nviews would make sense if what we are doing when we make a moral\njudgment is expressing our emotional attitudes on the matter. (See\nMcGrath 2009: 322, 2011; Hills 2011.)\n\nStanding against these considerations in favor of noncognitivism are a\nnumber of weighty problems. The most well-known challenge for\nnoncognitivism is the so-called Frege-Geach problem. If\n\u201cStealing is morally wrong\u201d is not even the kind of thing\nthat can be true or false, then how can we make sense of it when it is\nembedded in logically complex contexts (such as \u201cIf stealing is\nmorally wrong, then encouraging your brother to steal is morally\nwrong\u201d), and how are we to make sense of it as a premise in a\nvalid argument (since validity is, by definition, a truth-preserving\nrelation)?\n\nThere have been considerable efforts on behalf of noncognitivism to\nanswer this challenge. Simon Blackburn, for example, has pursued what\nhe calls a \u201cquasi-realist\u201d program (Blackburn 1984, 1993,\n1998). The quasi-realist is someone who endorses an anti-realist\nmetaphysical stance but who seeks, through philosophical maneuvering,\nto earn the right for moral discourse to enjoy all the\ntrappings of realist talk. Such a view may hold that although the\nunderlying logical structure of the sentence \u201cStealing is\nmorally wrong\u201d is nothing more than \u201cStealing:\nBoo!\u201d, it is nevertheless legitimate for ordinary speakers to\nsay things like \u201cIf stealing is morally wrong, then encouraging\nyour brother to steal is wrong\u201d or \u201c\u2018Stealing is\nmorally wrong\u2019 is true.\u201d One might, for instance, argue\nthat all that is required to make it acceptable to consider\n\u201cStealing is morally wrong\u201d true or false (and thus a\nlegitimate antecedent in a conditional) is that it has the appropriate\nsurface propositional grammar (\u201cx is P\u201d); and one might\nmaintain that choosing to employ such grammar to express one\u2019s\nnoncognitive attitudes brings no ontological commitment to any\ntroublesome property of moral wrongness.\n\nOne of the main challenges for the quasi-realist is to maintain a\ntheoretic distance from the moral realist. If the quasi-realist\nprogram succeeds in vindicating the use of the truth predicate for\nmoral sentences, and if in addition it makes it permissible to say\n\u201cIt is a fact that stealing is wrong,\u201d \u201cIt is a\nmind-independent fact that stealing is wrong,\u201d \u201cStealing\nwould be wrong even if our attitude toward it were different,\u201d\nand so on\u2014mimicking all and any of the moral realist\u2019s\nassertions\u2014then in what sense is quasi-realism\nquasi-realism?\u2014Why has it not simply collapsed into the\nrobust moral realism that it set out to oppose? (See Wright 1988;\nDreier 2018.) [A quick note on terminology: Although I have here\npresented Blackburn\u2019s quasi-realism as a potential avenue for\nthe noncognitivist to pursue, it should be noted that Blackburn\nhimself eschews the label \u201cnoncognitivism\u201d to describe the\nposition he defends (Blackburn 1996); his preferred term is\n\u201cprojectivism.\u201d (For discussion of the relation between\nthe two views\u2014noncognitivism and projectivism\u2014see Joyce\n2009.)]\n",
