    "main_text": "The Dutch Book Argument and Probabilistic Consistency || Depragmatized Arguments\n2.2 Depragmatized Arguments\n\nSeveral philosophers have sought to establish coherence as a\nconsistency constraint on degrees of belief through a version of the\nDBA that does not presuppose any definite connection between degrees\nof belief and preference (Christensen 1996, 2004; Howson and Urbach\n1993; Hellman 1997). These so-called depragmatized arguments\npurport to improve upon Ramsey\u2019s treatment by making clear how\ncoherence is supposed to mirror the ordinary notion of consistency.\nHowson and Urbach attempt this by identifying an agent\u2019s degree\nof belief in \\(M\\) with the bets she regards as fair,\nsuch that for credence \\(q\\) in \\(M\\), a\nbet with cost $\\(Sq\\) that pays\n\n\n\n\\($S\\)\nif \\(M\\) \n\n\\($0\\)\notherwise  \n\n\nis taken as fair. They then employ the Dutch Book theorem to argue\nthat incoherent degrees of belief cannot in fact be fair betting\nquotients, and thus that incoherence involves taking a set of bets as\nfair that cannot be fair, which is supposed to parallel having\ninconsistent beliefs.\n\nThere are several problems that undermine Howson and Urbach\u2019s\napproach. The most basic is that an agent with degree of belief \\(q\\)\nin \\(M\\) need not regard bets of the\nabove form as fair for a variety of reasons. To begin with she may\nsimply lack the concept of a fair bet. Secondly, she could have\ncredence \\(q\\), yet acknowledge the bet above as\nexplicitly unfair. For instance, if she knows \\(M\\) to\nbe either a logical truth or a logical falsehood, but has no idea\nwhich, her confidence that it is true could be \u00bd, though she\nmay well know that this would not be a fair betting quotient for it.\nCasting credences in terms of the bets that are regarded as fair is\nalso problematic in that it appears to associate degrees of belief\nwith having certain full beliefs, which some take to be problematic.\nThe argument also clearly falters over the additivity axiom, since\neven if an agent regards each of a set of bets as individually fair,\nthey may not be collectively fair by her lights, so she need not\nevaluate the bets required to produce a book as fair bets. Here, and\nin the basic assumption about the individual bets that an agent finds\nfair, it is in effect assumed that money acts as a measure of value.\nNot only is this not generally true, it calls attention to the fact\nthat the argument has not really been depragmatized. While Howson and\nUrbach do not rely on either the assumption that agents will (or\nshould) act in accordance with their degrees of belief or that they\nshould be willing to accept either direction of a fair bet, they do\nassume that agents make evaluations of bets, which are tied to the\nconcept of pragmatic value. Maher (1997) argues that their way of\nspelling out fairness in terms of a primitive concept of advantage, so\nas to avoid the notions of preference and utility, fails. Indeed, it\nis hard to see that the latter notions can be avoided in explicating\nthe concept of fairness, upon which their argument depends.\n\nA similar argument is offered by Christensen (1996), except that his\ndepragmatized DBA further weakens the connection between degrees of\nbelief and bets. Where Howson and Urbach specify that an agent will\nregard a bet as fair, Christensen assumes only that the bet is\nsanctioned as fair or justified by the agent\u2019s beliefs, thus\navoiding the first objection to Howson and Urbach\u2019s treatment.\nHe then invokes the Dutch Book theorem to argue that incoherent\ndegrees of belief sanction as fair a set of bets that cannot be fair,\nand claims this reveals that incoherence is fundamentally an\nepistemic, and indeed a logical, defect. But his argument clearly\nfaces the previous difficulty over the additivity axiom since, even if\ntwo bets are sanctioned individually, it does not follow that they are\nsanctioned jointly. In response to this problem, Christensen (2004)\nmodified his argument by restricting the assumption about the\nsanctioning of bets to \u201csimple agents\u201d who value only\nmoney, value it linearly, etc., so that monetary payoffs function as\nutilities for them. He then argued that degrees of belief that violate\nthe probability axioms in a simple agent are rationally defective\nbecause they sanction bets that would be guaranteed to lose money.\nFrom this he claimed that since it is the incoherent beliefs\nthemselves that have been shown to be defective, such beliefs are\nrationally defective in all agents.\n\nHere again, the pragmatic dimension of the argument seems to have been\nmerely submerged. Degrees of belief do not sanction bets in isolation\nfrom preference, and so the alleged defect in the simple agent who\nviolates the probability axioms cannot be pinned merely on those\nbeliefs. Since it is not the simple agent\u2019s beliefs themselves\nthat have been shown to be defective, but rather those beliefs in\ncombination with her preferences, the inference that incoherent\ndegrees of belief are rationally defective in all agents is invalid.\nFor all that has been shown, such beliefs might be fine in combination\nwith a different preference structure. Not only is it premature to\nconclude that incoherence is rationally defective generally,\nChristensen has not argued convincingly that incoherence is rationally\nor logically defective even in simple agents. It could be rational for\na simple agent to be incoherent if she were surrounded by \u201cCzech\nbookies\u201d, who will offer bets so that she is on the winning,\nrather than the losing, side of the book, because in this situation\nincoherence will lead to satisfaction of her one goal as a simple\nagent of increasing her monetary gain. Of course it is incoherence as\na logical defect, rather than one of means/ends rationality, that is\nChristensen\u2019s focus, but since sanctioning bets as fair that\ncannot be fair is not a property of incoherent credences alone, he has\nnot shown incoherence to be on a par with inconsistency with full\nbelief, where the defect lies with the beliefs themselves.\n",
