    "main_text": "\n\nIntegrity is one of the most important and oft-cited of virtue terms.\nIt is also perhaps the most puzzling. For example, while it is\nsometimes used virtually synonymously with \u2018moral,\u2019 we\nalso at times distinguish acting morally from acting with integrity.\nPersons of integrity may in fact act immorally\u2014though they would\nusually not know they are acting immorally. Thus one may acknowledge a\nperson to have integrity even though that person may hold what one\nthinks are importantly mistaken moral views.\n\nWhen used as a virtue term, \u2018integrity\u2019 refers to a\nquality of a person\u2019s character; however, there are other uses\nof the term. One may speak of the integrity of a wilderness region or\nan ecosystem, a computerized database, a defense system, a work of\nart, and so on. When it is applied to objects, integrity refers to the\nwholeness, intactness or purity of a thing\u2014meanings that are\nsometimes carried over when it is applied to people. A wilderness\nregion has integrity when it has not been corrupted by development or\nby the side-effects of development, when it remains intact as\nwilderness. A database maintains its integrity as long as it remains\nuncorrupted by error; a defense system as long as it is not breached.\nA musical work might be said to have integrity when its musical\nstructure has a certain completeness that is not intruded upon by\nuncoordinated, unrelated musical ideas; that is, when it possesses a\nkind of musical wholeness, intactness and purity.\n\nIntegrity is also attributed to various parts or aspects of a\nperson\u2019s life. We speak of attributes such as professional,\nintellectual and artistic integrity. However, the most philosophically\nimportant sense of the term \u2018integrity\u2019 relates to general\ncharacter. Philosophers have been particularly concerned to understand\nwhat it is for a person to exhibit integrity throughout life. What is\nit to be a person of integrity? Ordinary discourse about\nintegrity involves two fundamental intuitions: first, that integrity\nis primarily a formal relation one has to oneself, or between parts or\naspects of one\u2019s self; and second, that integrity is connected\nin an important way to acting morally, in other words, there are some\nsubstantive or normative constraints on what it is to act with\nintegrity.\n\nHow these two intuitions can be incorporated into a consistent theory\nof integrity is not obvious, and most accounts of integrity tend to\nfocus on one of these intuitions to the detriment of the other. A\nnumber of accounts have been advanced, the most important of them\nbeing: (i) integrity as the integration of self; (ii) integrity as\nmaintenance of identity; (iii) integrity as standing for something;\n(iv) integrity as moral purpose; and (v) integrity as a virtue. These\naccounts are reviewed below. We then examine several issues that have\nbeen of central concern to philosophers exploring the concept of\nintegrity: the relations between types of integrity, integrity and\nmoral theory, and integrity and social and political conditions.\n",
