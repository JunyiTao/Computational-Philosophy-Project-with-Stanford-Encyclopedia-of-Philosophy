A proof-theoretic approach that takes\nthe internal structure of atomic sentences into account, has been\nproposed by Wi\u0119ckowski (2008; 2011; 2016; 2021). He uses\nintroduction and elimination rules for atomic sentences, where these\natomic sentences are not just reduced to other atomic sentences, but\nto subatomic expressions representing the meaning of predicates and\nindividual names. Apart from its foundational significance, this can\nbe seen as a first step towards natural language applications of\nproof-theoretic semantics. A further step in this direction has been\nundertaken by Francez, who developed a proof-theoretic semantics for\nseveral fragments of English (see Francez, Dyckhoff, and Ben-Avi,\n2010; Francez and Dyckhoff, 2010; Francez and Ben-Avi, 2015; Francez,\n2022). Specifically, Francez is able to use the proof-theoretic\napproach to deal with scope ambiguity and many other issues of\nsemantic meaning variation. Besides computer science, natural language\ngrammar and natural language semantics will play a key role in the\npractical application of proof-theoretic semantics.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor the proof-theoretic semantics of natural language see\nFrancez (2015, Part II).\n",
