The aftermath of the Principia I: relations with John Locke and Richard Bentley\n\nAlthough the first editions of Newton\u2019s Principia and\nof Locke\u2019s Essay were published a mere three years\napart (in 1687 and 1690, respectively) their authors worked\nindependently and did not influence the first editions of one\nanother\u2019s principal texts. But then in 1688, Locke wrote a\nsympathetic (anonymous) review of the Principia. And right\naround the time of the publication of the first edition of the\nEssay, Newton and Locke became close friends and apparently\ninfluenced each other\u2019s thinking about philosophy, religion, and\ntheology in various ways (they first met in London in 1689). For his\npart, Locke called him the \u201cincomparable Mr. Newton\u201d on\nseveral occasions (e.g., in correspondence: Locke 1823: vol. 4: 55;\nand the next long quotation below). Most historians think that each\nquestioned the standard Anglican interpretation of the Trinity,\ncontending that Jesus of Nazareth was not a divine figure on the same\nlevel as God the creator. Interpreting the Bible through historical\nand philosophical analysis in a fashion that was not constrained by\nstandard Anglican doctrine in the late seventeenth century was\nfantastically important to Newton, occupying his attention for many\nyears. Given their controversial and politically sensitive nature, his\nso-called anti-Trinitarian views were largely kept secret among a\nsmall circle of friends. However, Newton trusted Locke enough to send\nhim a very long letter\u2014entitled \u201cTwo Notable Corruptions\nof Scripture\u201d\u2014to present him with the evidence for\nNewton\u2019s view that the original version of Christianity was\ncorrupted beginning in the 4th century by the introduction\nof the doctrine of the Trinity (Newton 1959\u2013, vol. 3:\n83\u2013129). Locke was apparently sympathetic with Newton\u2019s\napproach. With respect to their public views, Newton and Locke were\noften taken to represent two aspects of the same\nexperimental-philosophical approach toward the close of the\nseventeenth century (Stein 1990; Wilson 1999: 196\u2013214; and\nDomski 2012). It is perhaps not difficult to understand why, for\nNewton was mentioned in one of the most famous passages in all of\nLocke\u2019s writings. In the Epistle to the reader of Locke\u2019s\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding, we read:\n\n\nThe Commonwealth of Learning, is not at this time without\nMaster-Builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will\nleave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity; but every one\nmust not hope to be a Boyle, or a Sydenham; and in an age that\nproduces such masters, as the great Huygenius, and the incomparable\nMr. Newton, with some other of that strain; \u2019tis ambition enough\nto be employed as an under-labourer in clearing ground a little, and\nremoving some of the rubbish, that lies in the way to knowledge; which\ncertainly had been very much more advanced in the world, if the\nendeavors of ingenious and industrious men had not been much cumbred\nwith the learned but frivolous use of uncouth, affected, or\nunintelligible terms, introduced into the sciences, and there made an\nart of, to that degree, that philosophy, which is nothing but the true\nknowledge of things, was thought unfit, or uncapable to be brought\ninto well-bred company, and polite conversation. (Locke 1975: 10)\n\n\nClearly, Locke seeks in this passage, among other things, to align his\nwork in the Essay with the work of figures such as Newton.\nHere we find, at the opening of Locke\u2019s magnum opus, the\nsuggestion that he is content to be an \u201cunder-labourer\u201d, a\nthinker who helps to clear the way for the advance of knowledge. But\nhis list of four \u201cmaster builders\u201d\u2014Boyle, Sydenham,\nHuygens, and Newton\u2014might strike us as an odd pairing: what do\nthese four have in common exactly? It has recently been argued that\nLocke regarded the four as representing the new \u201cexperimental\nphilosophy\u201d, and that Locke himself should be interpreted as\nstrongly supporting that orientation within natural philosophy more\ngenerally (Anstey 2011: 220). This would become a popular conception\nof Newton\u2019s philosophical approach, one that played a\nsubstantial role in the Enlightenment.\n\nLocke may have regarded Newton as a fellow enthusiast for the\nexperimental philosophy, but there are reasons to think that his\nembrace of the mechanical philosophy presented him with a difficulty\nin interpreting the consequences of Newton\u2019s theory of universal\ngravity in the Principia. For Newton\u2019s theory seemed to\nbe in tension with a mechanist constraint on views of causation, at\nleast from Locke\u2019s own point of view. In the first edition of\nthe Essay, Locke articulated a central tenet of mechanist\nthinking about causation when he wrote: \u201cbodies operate by\nimpulse and nothing else\u201d (Essay, II.viii.11). Impulse\nrefers here to contact action. In correspondence with Locke that would\nprove to be influential, Bishop Edward Stillingfleet questioned this\nview from the Essay, contending that Locke must jettison the\nidea of human liberty if he insists that bodies can operate solely by\nimpulse, presumably on the grounds that the human will cannot be\nunderstood to cause bodily action in that manner. In a famous\nexchange, Locke responded in part by reformulating his commitment to\nthe mechanist view that all causation involving material bodies must\nbe by contact (impulse) alone:\n\n\nIt is true, I say, that \u2018bodies operate by impulse and nothing\nelse\u2019. And so I thought when I writ it, and can yet conceive no\nother way of their operation. But I am since convinced by the\njudicious Mr. Newton\u2019s incomparable book, that it is too bold a\npresumption to limit God\u2019s power, in this point, by my narrow\nconceptions. The gravitation of matter toward matter by ways\ninconceivable to me, is not only a demonstration that God can, if he\npleases, put into bodies, powers and ways of operations, above what\ncan be derived from our idea of body, or can be explained by what we\nknow of matter, but also an unquestionable and every where visible\ninstance, that he has done so. And therefore in the next edition of my\nbook, I shall take care to have that passage rectified. (Locke 1823:\nvol. 4: 467\u20138).\n\n\nThis was not merely his privately held view. For instance, near the\nbeginning of his Elements of Natural Philosophy, Locke\nwrites:\n\n\nTwo bodies at a distance will put one another into motion by the force\nof attraction; which is inexplicable by us, though made evident to us\nby experience, and so to be taken as a principle in natural\nphilosophy. (Locke 1823: vol. 3: 305)\n\n\nIn this way, Locke held the common view that Newton\u2019s theory of\nuniversal gravity was incompatible with the mechanical\nphilosophy\u2014and perhaps, unintelligible to us for that very\nreason\u2014and when forced to choose between these two options, he\nevidently sided with Newton, thinking that his theory was supported by\n\u201cexperience\u201d. He did so by endorsing the view that God\nmust have added \u201cpowers\u201d or \u201cways of\noperations\u201d to material bodies that cannot be derived from our\nidea of body. Such powers or ways of operations would in this case\nresult in gravitational interactions, presumably amongst bodies that\nare spatially separated from one another by great distances. Yet from\nLocke\u2019s point of view, the fact that Newton\u2019s theory\nconvinces him that such powers exist does not entail that\nthat theory renders gravity \u201cconceivable\u201d: even if the\ntheory of universal gravity is correct, it does not allow us to\nunderstand how matter\u2014what Locke would call \u201cextended\nsolid substance\u201d\u2014can interact gravitationally with other\nmatter when the bits of matter are not in contact with one another\n(Downing 1997). So Locke has concluded that bodies can operate on one\nanother through some means other than impulse, but he retains his\nfirmly held belief that any such operation is not intelligible to us.\nLocke accepted the conclusion that spatially separated bodies causally\ninteract with one another in accordance with the law of universal\ngravitation, but concluded that the law itself did not render that\ncausal interaction intelligible. This is precisely the kind of\nreaction to Newton\u2019s theory of universal gravity bemoaned by\nLeibniz, who would argue that any operations or powers attributed to\nmaterial bodies must meet the basic criterion of intelligibility\nestablished by the mechanist approach; he might also be inclined to\nargue that any laws regarded as governing the interactions of bodies\nmust also meet that criterion by being derivable in some way from our\nbasic concept of matter (see below). Regardless, this is an excellent\nexample of a case in which Newton\u2019s theory in the\nPrincipia had a direct impact on the development of\nphilosophical views of causation in the late seventeenth century.\n\nWhen the great English natural philosopher Robert Boyle died at the\nend of 1691, he endowed a lecture series designed to promote\nChristianity against what Boyle took to be the atheism that had\ninfected English culture after the revolutionary period of the\nmid-century. Famous Newtonians such as Samuel Clarke and William\nWhiston would eventually give the Boyle lectures. The first\n\u201cBoyle lecturer\u201d was the theologian Richard Bentley, who\nwould eventually become the Master of Newton\u2019s alma\nmater, Trinity College, Cambridge, and who also worked under\nLocke\u2019s correspondent, Bishop Stillingfleet, himself an admirer\nof Newton\u2019s (Gascoigne 1985: 65). When preparing his lectures\nfor publication\u2014they had been presented to a public audience in\nLondon in 1692\u2014Bentley conferred with Newton, hoping to solicit\nhis help in deciphering enough of the Principia to use its\nresults as a bulwark against atheism (Bentley 1976). Newton obliged,\nand a famous correspondence between the two began (eventually\npublished as Bentley 1756). The exchange is of great philosophical\ninterest, for Bentley elicited a number of important clarifications\nthat have no peer within Newton\u2019s published oeuvre.\n\nBentley sought Newton\u2019s assistance in particular because he\nwanted guidance in divining how the theory of the Principia\nindicates that the solar system must have been designed by an\nintelligent agent and could not have arisen through the physical\ninteractions of material bodies. In the first edition of the\nPrincipia in 1687, Newton had made such a claim in a very\nbrief statement (Newton 1972: vol. 2: 582\u20133; Cohen 1971:\n154\u20136). In the second edition of the text (published in 1713),\nhe removed that statement, replacing it with a more extensive\ndiscussion in the new section of the text, added to its end, called\nthe \u201cGeneral Scholium\u201d (mentioned above). Through their\ncorrespondence, Bentley learned that from Newton\u2019s point of\nview, the positions of the planets relative to one another\u2014and\nespecially to the sun\u2014indicate that mere chance, or the ordinary\nphysical interactions of the planetary bodies, could not have placed\neach planet in precisely the right orbit to maintain a solar system\nlike ours for an extended period of time. With this argument, Newton\nseems to be indicating that mere chance would have produced an\nunstable planetary system, one in which the planets would eventually\neither be too strongly attracted to the sun, falling into it, or too\nweakly attracted, flying off into space. In this episode, a theologian\nappeals to the new authority of Newtonian natural philosophy when\nattempting to undermine atheism. And that was apparently the very kind\nof interchange that Boyle had envisioned when endowing the lecture\nseries.\n\nNewton\u2019s correspondence with Bentley is justly famous for\nanother reason. The criticisms of Newton\u2019s theory of gravity by\nLeibniz and Huygens, outlined briefly above, would prove essential to\nthe Continental reception of Newtonian natural philosophy more\ngenerally in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.\nSince Newton held both of these mathematicians in high regard\u2014he\ntells Leibniz in a 1693 letter that \u201cHuygens is a master, and\nhis remarks on my discoveries are brilliant\u201d (Newton 2004:\n108)\u2014one might assume that their criticisms would have pressed\nNewton into articulating an extensive defense of the possibility of\naction at a distance. However, Newton presented no such defense, at\nleast not explicitly. In fact, there is evidence that Newton himself\nmay have rejected the possibility of action at a distance, despite the\nfact that the Principia allows it as a conceptual\npossibility, if not an empirical reality. The evidence lies in\nNewton\u2019s correspondence with Bentley. In February of 1693, after\nreceiving three letters from Newton, Bentley wrote an extensive reply\nthat attempted to characterize Newton\u2019s theory of gravity, along\nwith his understanding of the nature of matter, in a way that could be\nused to undermine various kinds of atheism. With the three earlier\nletters as his guide, Bentley makes the following estimation of\nNewton\u2019s understanding of the possibility that gravity could\nsomehow be an essential feature of material bodies:\n\n\n(2) And as for Gravitation, tis impossible that That should either be\nco\u00e6ternal & essential to Matter, or ever acquired by it. Not\nessential and co\u00e6ternal to Matter; for then even our System\nwould have been eternal (if gravity could form it) against our\nAtheist\u2019s supposition & what we have proved in our Last. For\nlet them assign any given time, that Matter convened from a Chaos into\nour System, they must affirm that before the given time matter\ngravitated eternally without convening, which is absurd. {Sir, I make\naccount, that your courteous suggestion by your Last, that a Chaos is\ninconsistent with the Hypothesis of innate Gravity, is included in\nthis paragraph of Mine.} and again, tis unconceivable, that inanimate\nbrute matter should (without a divine impression) operate upon &\naffect other matter without mutual contact: as it must, if gravitation\nbe essential and inherent in it. (Newton 1959\u2013vol. 3: 249)\n\n\nIn reply to this letter, Newton refers back to this second\nproposition, making one of the most famous of all his pronouncements\nconcerning the possibility of action at a distance:\n\n\nThe last clause of the second position I like very well. It is\ninconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the\nmediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and\naffect other matter without mutual contact, as it must be, if\ngravitation in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and inherent in it.\nAnd this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe innate\ngravity to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential\nto matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance through\na vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which\ntheir action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me\nso great an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical\nmatters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity\nmust be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain\nlaws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left\nopen to the consideration of my readers. (Newton 2004:\n 102\u20133)[24]\n\n\nIt certainly seems that Newton was uncomfortable with the very idea of\naction at a distance. But of course, things are not always as they\nseem in interpretations of difficult philosophical texts: some\nhistorians and philosophers have argued strongly that there are other\nreadings of the\n letter.[25]\n Rather than rejecting distant action between material bodies per\nse, they argue, Newton may have been rejecting a particular\nversion of that idea, one associated with the \u201cEpicurean\u201d\nview that gravity is somehow an essential feature of all material\nbodies, a stronger view than Newton might wish to endorse. The idea\nmight be roughly as follows: Newton wanted to leave open the\npossibility that God had endowed bodies with a power to act at a\ndistance on one another, a position that is at least reminiscent of\nLocke\u2019s view in his correspondence with Stillingfleet (see\nabove). The reason is that Newton held the standard view at the time\nthat matter itself is passive, requiring some kind of divine\nintervention in order to interact causally with other matter. Again,\none finds a Lockean echo of this idea (which may be no accident):\nLocke sometimes suggests that matter itself is passive in the sense\nthat it cannot move itself; instead, motion must be\n\u201csuperadded\u201d to it by God. If the world consisted solely\nof a bunch of material objects, say rocks floating in interstellar\nspace, then they would not experience any changes in their states of\nmotion unless some external force acted upon them. Left to its own\ndevices, matter is passive and does not move. To argue, as some\n\u201cEpicurean\u201d philosophers may have done, that matter itself\nessentially contains gravity as a feature, is to deny that matter is\npassive; it is to suggest that the rocks in interstellar space would\nattract one another and begin to move \u201con their own\u201d,\nwithout any external force influencing them. And this, in turn, might\nlead us on a slippery slope to atheism, for on this view, matter would\nact on its own, without any divine intervention. Or so Bentley and\nNewton might be interpreted.\n\nClearly, one reasonable motive for uncovering a nuanced interpretation\nof Newton\u2019s letter to Bentley is the obvious fact that Newton\napparently regarded action at a distance as perfectly possible when\nwriting the Principia. Indeed, it is difficult to reconcile\nthe Principia with the Bentley correspondence. One can argue\nthat although he left open the possibility of action at a distance in\nhis main work, Newton himself did not accept that possibility because\nof his more general commitments. The debate on such matters continues\nunabated. However, regardless of Newton\u2019s personal attitude\ntoward distant action among material bodies, his mechanist\ninterlocutors and readers continued to object to the physical theory\noutlined in Book III of the Principia on the grounds that, at\nthe very least, it left open the conceptual possibility of a kind of\naction that cannot in fact exist anywhere in nature. That remained one\nof Leibniz\u2019s principal objections against Newtonian natural\nphilosophy throughout the last twenty years of his life, animating his\ncorrespondence with numerous figures, including most prominently the\nNewtonian theologian and philosopher Samuel Clarke.\n",
