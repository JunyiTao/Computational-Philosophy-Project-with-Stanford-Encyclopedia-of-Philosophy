    "main_text": "Pythagoreanism, Mathematics || Iamblichus and Pythagoreanism\n4.3 Iamblichus and Pythagoreanism\n\nWhile Iamblichus took great pains to study mathematics in detail, its\ntrue meaning, according to him, is not of a \u201ctechnical\u201d\nnature: rather, it is meant to constitute a form of philosophical\nascesis:\n\n\nIf we intend to practice mathematics in a Pythagorean manner, it is\nnecessary to pursue with zeal its divinely inspired, elevating,\npurifying and perfective way. (On General Mathematical\nScience, chap. 22)\n\n\nIndeed, as part of his sumph\u014dnia programme, Iamblichus\nstrove to fully integrate Pythagorean teaching into the Hellenic\ndogmatic tradition, making Pythagoras the recipient of a divine\nrevelation handed down by Orpheus through a mysterious\nfigure, \u201cAglaophamus\u201d (De Vita\nPythagorica 146). Book II of On Pythagoreanism, the\nProtrepticus, while using a variety of sources, also taps\ninto the Pythagorean repertoire with wisdom texts such as the\nGolden Verses. Building on the then widely accepted axiom\nthat the truth had already been revealed in remote times and then\nmerely reformulated\u2014if not twisted\u2014by recent writers, he\naccepted as authoritative the pseudo-Pythagorean corpus for which he\n(along with Stobaeus, who knew the Iamblichean \u0153uvre\nquite well) is one of our main sources: on Iamblichus\u2019 library\nof Pythagorean texts, see Macris 2002. Iamblichus made the most\nconspicuous use of these texts in his lost Commentary on the\nCategories, where ps.-Archytas\u2019 On the All was\nrepeatedly quoted as the source of the Aristotelian treatise (see\nbelow,\n Section 5.1).\n\nIn order to assess Iamblichus\u2019 reliability as a witness of\nancient Pythagoreanism, one has to take into account a variety of\nfactors, including his attitude towards the information available to\nhim (ranging from literal dependence to creative elaboration for his\nown ideological and systematic purposes). This is crucial, since the\nPythagorean Life in particular is one of our major sources on\nthis subject (for details, see the studies collected in Huffman 2014;\nvon Albrecht et al. 2002).\n",
