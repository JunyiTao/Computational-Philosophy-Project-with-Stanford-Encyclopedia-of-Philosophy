Equality among Whom?\n\n\nSettling which aspect of people's condition (if any) should be the\nsame for all and fixing a measure of people's condition in this respect\nstill does not render an ideal of equality of condition fully\ndeterminate. So far the question remains open, among whom should\nequality of condition obtain? The same question arises if one dismisses\nor downgrades the equality of condition views and takes some relational\nequality ideal to capture the core morally required egalitarian\naspiration. Among whom should equality, of whatever type is deemed\nmorally required, obtain?\n\n\nAt some spots the discussion to this point has assumed an answer to\nthis question. The issue is posed, in what ways should the members of a\nsociety or nation state be made equal? Framing the issue in this way\npresumes that what is morally valuable is that equality prevails among\nthe members of each separate society. The idea then is that it is\ndesirable that the condition of the inhabitants of India should be\nrendered more equal and that the condition of inhabitants of Germany\nshould be rendered more equal but that equalizing the condition of\nGermans and Indians combined need not be desirable. But why not? (On\nthis issue, see Dworkin 2000 and Rawls, \u201cThe Law of Peoples,\u201d in Rawls\n1999.)\n\n\nIf equality is prized as a means to other values, it may be the case\nthat only equality among individuals who interact in significant ways\nhas a tendency to promote the desired further goals. For example, if we\nprize equality of possessions to foster social solidarity, it may be\nthat producing equality among people who live in distant parts of the\nglobe and hardly interact will have no tendency to promote solidarity\nacross the combined population. For the instrumental egalitarian, one\nshould seek equality among those collections of people in which\nequality would produce the desired further results.\n\n\nIf equality is valued for its own sake, rather than as a means to\nfurther goals, it is less clear why the domain of persons among whom\nequality should obtain is limited in space or time or by political\nboundaries. Why not hold that it is desirable that equality should\nprevail to the degree this is feasible among all persons who shall ever\nlive?\n\n\nThis question may not be rhetorical. Many philosophers hold that\nrequirements of social justice including requirements of egalitarianism\nare triggered by social interaction. When people interact in certain\nways, then and only then do egalitarian justice requirements apply and\nbecome binding on them. Call egalitarian justice theories that adopt\nthis position \u201csocial interactionist.\u201d\n\n\nPerhaps the dominant view among contemporary political theorists is\nthat when people set up a wide-ranging system of coercion on the scale\nof a political nation, special moral requirements come into play,\nincluding a requirement that all whose lives are ruled by this system\nof coercion should be treated equally or brought to an equal condition\nin some respects. (If a world government were established, the special\nrequirements would be global in scope.)\n\n\nThis idea comes in various versions. One idea is that it makes sense\nto deploy the concept of justice\u2014not just egalitarian justice,\nbut any justice notion\u2014only where there is a stable scheme of\nenforcement in place, or at least the potential for that, which only\nthe framework of a functioning state supplies (Nagel 2005; for\ncriticism see Cohen and Sabel 2006 and Julius 2006). The basic thought\nis that justice norms cease to be binding if the individual cannot be\nconfident that others will comply so that the goods the scheme of\njustice promises will in fact obtain. If a bus is stalled at the bottom\nof a hill, and the passengers can work together to push it to the top\nof the hill if all cooperate together, but pushing by less than all\nproduces no gain, and there is no expectation that all the rest will\ncooperate, one has no clear duty to cooperate by doing one's\n\u201cfair share\u201d of pushing. But the bus example is a special\ncase, which may not generalize to illuminate the run of global justice\nissues. If some of us insist that the products we buy not be produced\nby coerced or maltreated laborers, and the result of the insistence is\nthat some laborers suffer less coercion and maltreatment, whether\nconsumers generally follow our example may not diminish or offset the\neffects of what some do. Justice might require me to join the some who\nare insisting on fair play. If there is a justice duty falling on\neconomically advanced nations to open their doors more than they now do\nto needy would-be immigrants, one country's opening its doors as\nrequired by this duty does good for the people admitted independently\nof whether or not any other advanced nations follow suit. My behaving\nin a way that emits excessive greenhouse gases may result in harm in\nthe future to some determinate persons that is caused by me and would\nnot occur but for my actions, and these facts may bring into play a\nduty of justice to refrain from wrongfully harming non-consenting\nothers.\n\n\nAnother view is that the state massively coerces individuals\nresiding within its claimed jurisdiction and does not to the same\nextent massively coerce those outside its territorial borders. The\nimposition of this massive coercion on individuals inside a nation is a\npresumptive violation of their autonomy, which demands a strong\njustification if state coercion is to be rightly deemed legitimate,\nmorally permissible. It is plausible to suppose the required\njustification must include acknowledgement that the state must organize\nsociety so that egalitarian principles such as the Rawlsian difference\nprinciple are satisfied. The plausibility of this claim increases once\none notices that the state might enforce any of a wide range of\nconceptions of property and criminal law and tort, and selecting one\nrather than another conception to enforce will be to the advantage of\nsome citizens and the disadvantage of others. Hence the requirement is\ntriggered to the effect that the coercive scheme must be justifiable in\nparticular to the one who fares worst under the scheme. This in turn\npoints either to a strong insistence on equality or the difference\nprinciple (Blake 2001 and Miller 1998), but the case for the insistence\nis limited in scope by the jurisdiction of the coercive scheme.\n\n\nA difficulty with this view is that imposition of a massively\ncoercive scheme either need pose no threat to individual autonomy or if\nit does pose a threat, does so only in circumstances in which the\nautonomy that is downgraded is worth very little. The law issues\ncredible coercive threats that if, for example, I were to murder\nsomeone, I would be arrested, prosecuted, and subjected to capital\npunishment or a long prison sentence. If I have no desire whatsoever to\nmurder anyone, the coercion sits on me light as a feather and does not\nreduce my autonomy. Suppose I developed a desire to murder someone and\nwould act to satisfy the desire except that I am deterred by the\nlaw's coercive threats. Now arguably the law significantly\nimpinges on my autonomy, but this is clearly a better state of affairs\nthan would result if the criminal law penalties against murder were\nremoved. Suppose on the other hand the law piles criminal penalties on\na type of activity that is innocent and harmless such as walking on the\nbeach. Here the coercion wrongfully restricts autonomy. The solution is\nto repeal the law. The concern then is that either the coercion imposed\non individuals by the state is morally acceptable, in which case no\nspecial compensation is owed to those coerced, or it is morally\nunacceptable, in which case the coercion should be withdrawn. The\npicture of coercion constricting the autonomy of the coerced and thus\npresumptively wrong unless compensation is paid to the coerced appears\nto be fading away. And if this picture is not sustainable, then it\ncannot help explain why equality should be required within but not\nacross national borders.\n\n\nThis argument will not do as it stands because there might be cases\nin which imposition of coercion is neither unconditionally right nor\nunconditionally wrong but rather conditionally\nacceptable\u2014acceptable provided adequate compensation is paid to\nthose whose autonomy is burdened by the coercion. Are there such cases?\nPerhaps conscription of youth for military service in a just war can be\nmorally permissible, but only if compensation is paid to those coerced\ninto this arduous and dangerous service. Coercion requires a\njustification, which might include compensation to the coerced, but\nneed not in all cases. What is necessary is adequate moral\njustification. The justification of having coercive states, and the\nreason all of us ought to support them, might appeal to the need to\nhave stable protection of certain important rights of insiders (those\nwho live inside the state's borders) and outsiders as well.\nNothing so far rules out the possibility that these rights include\negalitarian rights of global scope. The sheer fact that the particular\nstate of the land you inhabit coerces you arguably does not establish\nany sort of presumption that the state's scheme of coercion must\nbe specially tailored to your interests, that those coerced have\nspecial justice claims on the particular state that coerces them.\n\n\nAnother possible idea in this area is that the state both massively\ncoerces its members but not outsiders and also claims to speak in the\nname of the members who are coerced. By claiming to speak in our name,\nthe state involves the will of those in whose name it claims to act.\nThe state not only does but must claim to speak in the name of those it\ncoerces; rulers of a state could not avoid the moral implications that\nflow from this claim by explaining that they are just authoritarian\nrulers, bosses who command state power and plan to rule for their own\npersonal benefit. The state compels obedience to its commands and\naffirms that these commands reflect the legitimate will of the\ncommanded subjects. The argument then is that the combination of these\nconditions triggers the application of egalitarian principles of\njustice and these principles apply state by state, not across all\nstates (Dworkin 2000 and Nagel 2005).\n\n\nA concern regarding this line of thought is that whenever one acts,\nwhat one does should be justifiable to those who are affected or might\nbe affected by one's choice. If what one does is justifiable, in\nprinciple anyone who is impinged on or ignored can be provided a\njustification of what is being done to them (or not being done to\nthem), a justification they can accept and will accept if they sort\nthrough the relevant considerations and assess them rightly. In this\nsense, whenever individuals make choices, their choices involve the\nwill of all those who are impinged on or might have been impinged on by\none or another choice that might have been made. And for that matter,\nbystanders who could not have been affected in any way by what is done\nbut who are aware that some individual is choosing some act or omission\nshould also be able to discern a fully adequate justification for what\nis done. The involvement of the will of those one's action\nimpinges on turns out to encompass the entire community of rational\nagents, all of whom should be able to see that what one does is\nrationally justified. So it is still mysterious how the involvement of\nthe will of those coerced by the laws and public policies of a\nfunctioning state might be thought to trigger the application of\nspecial egalitarian justice obligations that do not apply except among\nthose caught in the particular web of coercion.\n\n\nAnother line of thought offered to support the claim that\negalitarian justice duties apply state by state among the members of\neach political community united by a state rather than among all\ninhabitants of a region of the Earth or all of the Earth's\ninhabitants or among all rational agents anywhere and everywhere\nappeals not to state coercion but to collective goods. The suggestion\nis that the members of any tolerably well-functioning political\ncommunity cooperate together through the state to provide crucial\nbenefits to all\u2014basic goods of physical security, property, and\nthe rule of law. In the absence of these goods one would not have a\nreasonable opportunity to pursue any plan of life. People's\ncompliance with legal rules and basic norms of cooperation supplies\nthese crucial goods to all, and thus obligations of reciprocity are\ntriggered in all recipients. At this point a luck egalitarian\nconsideration enters the argument. Factors beyond anyone's\nindividual power to control importantly affect her good fortune or bad\nfortune under the existing scheme of cooperation in her political\ncommunity; hence what one owes to other fellow cooperators by way of\nreciprocity takes the form of egalitarian justice requirements along\nthe lines of the difference principle. These egalitarian justice\nrequirements are owed by the members of each distinct political\ncommunity to each other and not to outsiders (Sangiovanni 2007).\n\n\nThis line of thought prompts several questions. If stringent\negalitarian duties to needy people arise only because the needy\nparticipate in a scheme of cooperation with the non-needy, then\nstrategic action to avoid the duties seems permissible. If the rich\nseparate from the poor and form their own distinct political\ncommunities, the reciprocity argument will no longer support the claim\nthat the rich have substantial obligations to the poor. One might\nquestion whether genuine justice obligations are avoidable in this way\n(Cohen and Sabel 2006). Another question is whether reciprocity\nobligations formed by cooperative collective provision nicely divide\nstate by state as the argument supposes. In Southern California, the\nlaw abidingness of neighbors in Mexico is more crucial to\npeople's physical security than the law abidingness of fellow\ncitizens in Maine or Florida. Treaties and peaceful relations among\nmilitarily armed states, brought into being by peaceable desires of\npeople in all the states, are immensely important to people's\nphysical security in all of the potentially threatening nations. A\nthird question is why reciprocity obligations owed to fellow\ncooperators in basic security schemes amount to more than the\nrequirement to contribute a fair share to the burdens of supplying the\ngoods. It is not immediately clear why requirements of egalitarian\nredistribution arise in this way, since socially disadvantaged people\nmay benefit equally as much as socially advantaged folk from the goods\nthat such cooperation supplies.\n\n\nThe social interactionist arguments just canvassed purport to show\nthat special egalitarian justice requirements apply among members of a\nnation state and require equality only among those members. The\narguments do not attempt to show that no egalitarian justice\nrequirements hold across national borders. These cross-border\nrequirements are presumably triggered by a morally mandatory\nbeneficence requirement that gives special priority to helping people,\nthe worse off they are, or by a luck egalitarian principle such as the\nfollowing: It is morally bad\u2014unjust and unfair\u2014if some are\nworse off than others through no fault or choice of their own. The\nweightier the special egalitarian obligations that the social\ninteractionist sees holding country by country, and the less weighty\nthe general egalitarianism that is perceived to hold across countries,\nthe more the social interactionist approach will conflict with general\negalitarian equality of condition doctrines that are claimed to have\nglobal scope.\n\n\nAnother version of social interactionism does not seek to show that\nnational borders are morally important for determining what we owe each\nother by way of egalitarian justice. This approach holds that stricter\negalitarian justice duties are gradually triggered by social\ninteraction, and become more stringent and demanding as the density of\nsocial interaction increases (Cohen and Sabel 2006 and Julius 2006, see\nalso Julius 2003). On this view, egalitarian justice duties might be\nstrongest among the members of a political community, strong among\npeople involved in dense regional trade and other forms of association,\nless strong among more far-flung inhabitants of the globe whose social\ninteraction ties are slight.\n\n\nA related social interactionist approach holds that egalitarian\njustice requirements come into play among people where there is a\nframework of institutions and rules or a basic social structure\nregulating their interactions. Some see such a cooperative framework\nexisting only in each separate nation state; some see a global\ncooperative framework (Beitz 1979, Pogge 1989). The background idea is\nthat justice becomes relevant when people are cooperating together for\nmutual gain under common rules.\n\n\nThe question, whether the requirement of equalizing people's\ncondition applies within particular societies but not across societies\non a global scale, might be thought to raise a rough dilemma for the\nnormative attractiveness of any equality ideal. The dilemma arises in\nthe following train of thought. On the one hand, there is no good basis\nfor restricting the scope of equality. If equality matters, the group\nthat should be made equal is people everywhere. On the other hand, a\nglobal equality requirement will strike many as deeply counterintuitive\nbecause it seems to impose very demanding requirements on prosperous\nindividuals and nations to share their wealth with less prosperous\nstrangers in distant lands. The dilemma paints egalitarianism as either\n(1) parochial or (2) Quixotic and utopian. To remove this impression of\ndilemma, it would suffice either to defend the restriction of\negalitarian requirements to single societies or to show that the\nrequirements of demanding global egalitarianism are not really\ncounterintuitive.\n\n\nFurther issues may be raised about the nature of the individuals\namong whom equality should obtain. One might hold that across whatever\nkind of group is deemed to be the relevant domain of equality,\nindividuals in the domain should be made equal in condition over the\ncourse of their lives. This view would allow that people might fare\nunequally well at different stages of life so long as their lifetimes\ntaken as a whole are identical in faring well. Another possibility is\nthat the individual persons at the same stage of the life cycle should\nbe rendered equal in condition. On this latter view, a society in which\nover time the people who are old all enjoy the same condition, and\nlikewise the people who are young and those who are middle-aged, could\nperfectly conform to the ideal of stage-by-stage equality of condition\neven if the old are (say) far better off than the middle-aged and the\nmiddle-aged are always far better off than the young. From the\nwhole-lives perspective, stage-by-stage equality is unacceptable,\nbecause some people die young, and those who die young never get to\nenjoy the peak condition. One might uphold a stringent view that\nrequires, so far as possible, that all achieve the same lifetime level\nof good and that in addition at each separate stage of life\n(individuated how?) everyone achieves the same level of good. Another\npossible view is that equality should be formulated so it demands that\nfrom now, the condition of all those living should be equalized\n(regardless of what condition people enjoyed in the past). (See\nMcKerlie 1989 and 2001 and Temkin 1993, chapter 8).\n\n\nAnother issue emerges if one asks: why focus on individual persons\nrather than on groups? One might hold that it is not important that\nindividual persons have equal life prospects, but it is morally\nvaluable that men and women on the whole should have equal life\nprospects, that heterosexuals and non-heterosexuals should have the\nsame life prospects, that people of different supposed races should\nhave the same life prospects on the whole, and so on. To fill out this\nproposal one would need to develop a normative account that explains\nwhat sorts of group classifications matter for this purpose and on what\ngrounds. Notice that one might be troubled, for example, if it is found\nthat men have better life prospects on the average than women, because\nthat would be an indicator that perhaps equality of opportunity and\nfair equality of opportunity are not satisfied. To be moved by this\nconsideration is not to value equality of condition across groups per\nse.\n\n\nFinally, the discussion in this entry assumes that if equality is\nvaluable or morally required, the equality that matters is equality\namong human persons. Equality across individual humans and individual\nmembers of other animal species has not been envisaged. But why not? If\nhuman beings are picked out as morally special, some reasonable ground\nmust be adduced for this selection. In view of the fact that there\nmight be intelligent beings who qualify as persons but are nonhuman\n(angels, intelligent extraterrestrials, and so on), perhaps we should\nfocus on persons and consider whether equality of condition should\nprevail among persons and only among persons and if so, on what basis.\nNotice that the claim that human persons share a special equal status\nfrom which less intelligent animals are excluded still allows that\nthese animals, though not equal in status to humans, may nonetheless be\nmorally considerable.\n",
