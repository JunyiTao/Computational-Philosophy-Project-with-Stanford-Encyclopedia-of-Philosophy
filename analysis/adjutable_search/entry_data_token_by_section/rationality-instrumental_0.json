    "main_text": "Rational Coherence and Reason\n1. Rational Coherence and Reason\n\nSomeone displays instrumentally rationality insofar as she adopts\nsuitable means to her ends. But how should \u201crationality\u201d\nbe understood? Here it is important to distinguish between two things\nthat the casually phrased question, \u201cWhat would it be rational\nfor an agent to do or intend?\u201d could mean:\n\nBy doing or intending what would the agent make her responses\n(i.e., her attitudes and actions) cohere with one another?\nCall the answer, stipulatively, what it would be rationally\ncoherent for the agent to do or intend.\nWhat does the agent have reason, or ought she, to do or intend?\nThis is the question that an agent characteristically asks when she is\ndeliberating about what to do or intend, or when someone else is\nadvising her what to do or intend. (Note that claims about reasons are\nweaker than claims about \u201coughts\u201d. One could have a reason\nto do something without it being the case that one ought to do it, as\nwhen the reason is outweighed by competing reasons. However, it is\ngenerally thought that if one ought to do something, then one has a\nreason to do it.)\n\n\nAs with any philosophical distinction, this contrast between\n\u201crational coherence\u201d and \u201creason\u201d might be\nquestioned. But it is accepted by many of the authors who have written\non the subject, and it will help to organize the discussion of the\nsubject matter.\n\nIn principle, the answers to these questions might perfectly coincide:\nthat what agents have reason, or ought, to do just is what it would be\nrationally coherent for them to do, and vice versa. In several ways,\nhowever, the answers might be expected to diverge.\n\nFirst, even if what one ought to do is just to make one\u2019s\nresponses globally coherent, what it takes to make\none\u2019s responses locally coherent might differ from what\nit takes to make them globally coherent. According to the Subjective\nDesire-Based Theory, for example, what agents have reason, or ought,\nto do or intend is just what, given what they believe their\ncircumstances to be, would best satisfy their strongest, present\nintrinsic desires taken as a whole. Suppose that the agent\u2019s\nstrongest, present intrinsic desire is for health. Nevertheless, out\nof habit, he intends to have a smoke, believing that lighting up is a\nnecessary means. According to the Subjective Desire-Based Theory, it\nis not the case that he ought to intend to light up. And it might be\nsaid that if he were globally coherent, the agent would not intend to\nlight up. But if he does form an intention to light up, he at least\nachieves a kind of local coherence.\n\nSecond, what the agent has reason, or ought, to do or intend may\ndepend not on what she believes her circumstances to be, but\non something more \u201cobjective.\u201d There are several\npossibilities. What an agent has reason, or ought, to do, might be\nwhat the evidence (where this depends on something other than her\nattitudes) available to the agent suggests about her circumstances,\nwhat the evidence of the person making the reason- or ought-claim\nsuggests about the agent\u2019s circumstances, what the evidence of\nthe person assessing the claim suggests about the agent\u2019s\ncircumstances, or all of the relevant facts about the agent\u2019s\ncircumstances. Consider the Objective Desire-Based Theory, which says\nthat agents have reason, or ought, to do or intend just what, given\nwhat their circumstances actually are, would best satisfy their\nstrongest, present intrinsic desires taken as a whole. Suppose the\nagent\u2019s strongest, present intrinsic desire is to drink a gin\nand tonic, and she so intends. However, she mistakenly believes that\nthe stuff in this bottle is gin, when it is in fact petrol. So she\nbelieves that mixing the stuff with tonic is a means to drinking a gin\nand tonic. According to the Objective Desire-Based Theory, she does\nnot have reason to intend to mix the stuff with tonic and drink it.\nBut if she does so intend, she might be said to have achieved a kind\nof rational coherence, both local and global.\n\nThird, one might hold not a Desire-Based Theory, but a Value-Based\nTheory, according to which whatever ultimate ends an agent\nhas reason, or ought, to achieve depend not on what she\ndesires or wills, but instead on what is of\nindependent value. Suppose the madman\u2019s strongest, present\nintrinsic desire is to set off a nuclear war, and he so intends.\nMoreover, the madman knows that intending to press this button is a\nnecessary and sufficient means to setting off a nuclear war. It might\nbe said that, in intending to press this button, the madman would\nachieve a kind of coherence, both local and global. And according to\nthe Desire-Based Theories, the madman ought so to intend. According to\na Value-Based Theory, however, it presumably is not the case that he\nought so to intend.\n\nThere are several reasons, therefore, to expect at least some\ndivergence between what one has reason, or ought, to do or intend, and\nwhat it would be rationally coherent for one to do or intend. But that\nis perfectly compatible with partial convergence, even of a\nnon-accidental character. As we will discuss below, some suggest that\namong the things that agents have reason, or ought, to do or intend is\nprecisely to make their responses rationally coherent. Just as we\nought not to torture, or ought to care for our children, we ought to\nbe rationally coherent.\n",
