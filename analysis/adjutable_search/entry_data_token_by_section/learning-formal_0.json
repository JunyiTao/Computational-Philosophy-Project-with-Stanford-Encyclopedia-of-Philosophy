    "main_text": "Convergence to the Truth and Nothing But the Truth\n1. Convergence to the Truth and Nothing But the Truth\n\nLearning-theoretic analysis assesses dispositions for forming beliefs.\nSeveral terms for belief acquisition processes are in common use in\nphilosophy; I will use \u201cinductive strategy\u201d,\n\u201cinference method\u201d and most frequently \u201cinductive\nmethod\u201d to mean the same thing. The best way to understand how\nlearning theory evaluates inductive methods is to work through some\nexamples. The following presentation begins with some very simple\ninductive problems and moves on to more complicated and more realistic\nsettings.\n",
