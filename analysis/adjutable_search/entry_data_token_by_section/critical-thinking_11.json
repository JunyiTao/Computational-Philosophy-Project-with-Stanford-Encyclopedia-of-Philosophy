Critical Thinking Dispositions\n\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\n\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\n\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\n\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n",
