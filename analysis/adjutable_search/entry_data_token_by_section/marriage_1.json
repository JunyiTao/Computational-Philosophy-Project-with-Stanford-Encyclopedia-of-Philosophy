Understanding Marriage: Historical Orientation\n\nSetting the agenda for contemporary debate, ancient and medieval\nphilosophers raised recurring themes in the philosophy of marriage:\nthe relation between marriage and the state, the role of sex and\nprocreation in marriage, and the gendered nature of spousal roles.\nTheir works reflect evolving, and overlapping, ideas of marriage as an\neconomic or procreative unit, a religious sacrament, a contractual\nassociation, and a relationship of mutual support.\n\nIn his depiction of the ideal state, Plato (427\u2013347 BCE)\ndescribed a form of marriage contrasting greatly with actual marriage\npractices of his time. He argued that, just as male and female\nwatchdogs perform the same duties, men and women should work together,\nand, among Guardians, \u2018wives and children [should be held] in\ncommon\u2019 (The Republic, ca. 375\u2013370 BCE,\n423e\u2013424a). To orchestrate eugenic breeding, temporary marriages\nwould be made at festivals, where matches, apparently chosen by lot,\nwould be secretly arranged by the Rulers. Resulting offspring would be\ntaken from biological parents and reared anonymously in nurseries.\nPlato\u2019s reason for this radical restructuring of marriage was to\nextend family sympathies from the nuclear family to the state itself:\nthe abolition of the private family was intended to discourage private\ninterests at odds with the common good and the strength of the state\n(ibid., 449a-466d; in Plato\u2019s Laws, ca.\n355\u201347 BCE, private marriage is retained but still designed for\npublic benefit).\n\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) sharply criticized this proposal as\nunworkable. On his view, Plato errs in assuming that the natural love\nfor one\u2019s own family can be transferred to all fellow-citizens.\nThe state arises from component parts, beginning with the natural\nprocreative union of male and female. It is thus a state of families\nrather than a family state, and its dependence on the functioning of\nindividual households makes marriage essential to political theory\n(Politics, 1264b). The Aristotelian idea that the stability\nof society depends on the marital family influenced Hegel, Rawls, and\nSandel, among others. Aristotle also disagreed with Plato on gender\nroles in marriage, and these views too would prove influential.\nMarriage, he argued, is properly structured by gender: the husband,\n\u201cfitter for command,\u201d rules. The sexes express their\nexcellences differently: \u201cthe courage of a man is shown in\ncommanding, of a woman in obeying,\u201d a complementarity which\npromotes the marital good (Politics, ca. 330 BCE, 1253b,\n1259b, 1260a; Nicomachean Ethics, ca. 325 BCE,\n1160\u201362).\n\nIn contrast to the ancients, whose philosophical discussion of sex and\nsexual love was not confined to marriage, Christian philosophers\nintroduced a new focus on marriage as the sole permissible context for\nsex, marking a shift from viewing marriage as primarily a political\nand economic unit. St. Augustine (354\u2013430), following St. Paul,\ncondemns sex outside marriage and lust within it. \u201c[A]bstinence\nfrom all sexual union is better even than marital intercourse\nperformed for the sake of procreating,\u201d and the unmarried state\nis best of all (The Excellence of Marriage, ca. 401, \u00a76,\n13/15). But marriage is justified by its goods: \u201cchildren,\nfidelity [between spouses], and sacrament.\u201d Although procreation\nis the purpose of marriage, marriage does not morally rehabilitate\nlust. Instead, the reason for the individual marital sexual act\ndetermines its permissibility. Sex for the sake of procreation is not\nsinful, and sex within marriage solely to satisfy lust is a pardonable\n(venial) sin. As marital sex is preferable to\n\u201cfornication\u201d (extra-marital sex), spouses owe the\n\u201cmarriage debt\u201d (sex) to protect against temptation,\nthereby sustaining mutual fidelity (Marriage and Desire, Book\nI, ca. 418\u201319, \u00a77, 8, 17/19, 14/16).\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas (ca. 1225\u20131274) grounded concurring judgments\nabout sexual morality in natural law, explicating marriage in terms of\nbasic human goods, including procreation and fidelity between spouses\n(Finnis 1997). Monogamous marriage, as the arrangement fit for the\nrearing of children, \u201cbelong[s] to the natural law.\u201d\nMonogamous marriage secures paternal guidance, which a child needs;\nfornication is thus a mortal sin because it \u201ctends to injure the\nlife of the offspring.\u201d (Aquinas rejects polygamy on similar\ngrounds while, like Augustine, arguing that it was once permitted to\npopulate the earth.) Marital sex employs the body for its purpose of\npreserving the species, and pleasure may be a divinely ordained part\nof this. Even within marriage, sex is morally troubling because it\ninvolves \u201ca loss of reason,\u201d but this is compensated by\nthe goods of marriage (Summa Theologiae, unfinished at\nAquinas\u2019 death, II-II, 153, 2; 154, 2). Among these goods,\nAquinas emphasizes the mutual fidelity of the spouses, including\npayment of the \u201cmarriage debt\u201d and \u201cpartnership of a\ncommon life\u201d\u2014a step towards ideas of companionate marriage\n(Summa Theologiae, Supp. 49, 1).\n\nIndeed, we see indications of discontent with the economic model of\nmarriage a century earlier in the letters of H\u00e9lo\u00efse (ca.\n1100\u20131163) to Abelard (1079\u20131142). H\u00e9lo\u00efse\nattacks marriage, understood as an economic transaction, arguing that\na woman marrying for money or position deserves \u201cwages, not\ngratitude\u201d and would \u201cprostitute herself to a richer man,\nif she could.\u201d In place of this economic relation she praises\nlove, understood on a Ciceronian model of friendship: the \u201cname\nof wife may seem more sacred or more binding, but sweeter for me will\nalways be the word friend (amica), or, if you will permit me,\nthat of concubine or whore\u201d (Abelard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse,\nLetters, ca. 1133\u20131138, 51\u20132). The relation\nbetween love and marriage will continue to preoccupy later\nphilosophers. Do marital obligations and economic incentives threaten\nlove, as H\u00e9lo\u00efse suggested? (Cave 2003, Card 1996) As\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855) dramatically suggests in\nThe Seducer\u2019s Diary, are the obligations of marriage\nincompatible with romantic and erotic love? Or, instead, does marital\ncommitment uniquely enable spousal love, as Aquinas suggested? (Finnis\n1997; cf. Kierkegaard\u2019s Judge William\u2019s defense of\nmarriage [Either/Or, 1843, vol. 2].)\n\nQuestions of the relation between love and marriage emerge from\nchanging understandings of the role of marriage; in the early modern\nera, further fault lines appear as new understandings of human society\nconflict with the traditional structure of marriage. For Aristotle,\nAugustine, and Aquinas, marriage was unproblematically structured by\nsexual difference, and its distinctive features explained by nature or\nsacrament. But in the early modern era, as doctrines of equal rights\nand contract appeared, a new ideal of relationships between adults as\nfree choices between equals appeared. In this light, the unequal and\nunchosen content of the marriage relationship raised philosophical\nproblems. Thomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679) acknowledged that his\narguments for rough equality among humans apply to women:\n\u201cwhereas some have attributed the dominion [over children] to\nthe man only, as being of the more excellent sex; they misreckon in\nit. For there is not always that difference of strength, or prudence\nbetween the man and the woman, as that the right can be determined\nwithout war.\u201d Nonetheless, Hobbes admits that men dominate in\nmarriage, which he explains (inadequately) thus: \u201cfor the most\npart commonwealths have been erected by the fathers, not by the\nmothers of families\u201d (Leviathan, 1651, Ch. 20; Okin\n1979, 198\u2013199, Pateman 1988, 44\u201350).\n\nLikewise, defending marital hierarchy posed a problem for John Locke\n(1632\u20131704). Locke ties his rejection of political patriarchy to\na rejection of the patriarchal family, arguing that marriage, like the\nstate, rests on consent, not natural hierarchy; marriage is a\n\u201cvoluntary compact.\u201d But Locke fails to follow this\nreasoning consistently, for Lockean marriage remains hierarchical: in\ncases of conflict, \u201cthe rule \u2026 naturally falls to the\nman\u2019s as the abler and stronger.\u201d Ceding decision-making\npower to one party on the basis of a presumed natural hierarchy\ncreates an internal tension in Locke\u2019s views (The Second\nTreatise of Government, 1690, \u00a777, 81, 82; Okin 1979,\n199\u2013200). This inconsistency prompted Mary Astell\u2019s\n(1666\u20131731) response: \u201cIf all Men are born free,\nhow is it that all women are born slaves? as they must be if the being\nsubjected to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary\nWill of Men, be the perfect Condition of Slavery?\u201d\n(\u201cReflections upon Marriage,\u201d 1700, 18) Similar tensions\narise for Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712\u20131778), whose treatise on\neducation, \u00c9mile, describes the unequal status of\n\u00c9mile\u2019s wife, Sophie. Her education, a template for all\nwomen\u2019s, prepares her only to please and serve her husband and\nrear children. Mary Wollstonecraft (1759\u20131798) attacked\nRousseau\u2019s views on women\u2019s nature, education, and marital\ninequality in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (see also\nOkin 1979, Chapter 6).\n\nThe contractual understanding of marriage prompts the question as to\nwhy marital obligations should be fixed other than by spousal\nagreement. Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) combined a contractual\naccount of marriage with an Augustinian preoccupation with sexual\nmorality to argue that the distinctive content of the marriage\ncontract was required to make sex permissible. In Kant\u2019s view,\nsex involves morally problematic objectification, or treatment of\noneself and other as a mere means. The marriage right, a \u201cright\nto a person akin to a right to a thing,\u201d gives spouses\n\u201clifelong possession of each other\u2019s sexual\nattributes,\u201d a transaction supposed to render sex compatible\nwith respect for humanity: \u201cwhile one person is acquired by the\nother as if it were a thing, the one who is acquired acquires\nthe other in turn; for in this way each reclaims itself and restores\nits personality.\u201d But while these rights, according to Kant,\nmake sex compatible with justice, married sex is not clearly virtuous\nunless procreation is a possibility (Metaphysics of Morals,\n1797\u201398, Ak 6:277\u201379, 6:424\u2013427). Kant\u2019s\naccount of sexual objectification has had wide influence\u2014from\nfeminists to new natural lawyers. More surprisingly, given his views\non gender inequality and the wrongness of same-sex sexual activity,\nKant\u2019s account of marriage has been sympathetically\nreconstructed by feminists and defenders of same-sex marriage drawn by\nKant\u2019s focus on equality, reciprocity, and the moral\nrehabilitation of sex within marriage (Herman 1993, Altman 2010,\nPapadaki 2010). Kant interestingly suggests that morally problematic\nrelationships can be reconstructed through equal juridical rights, but\nhow such reconstruction occurs is puzzling (Herman 1993, Brake 2005).\nAmong other things, it is difficult to see how Kant\u2019s insistence\non equal marriage rights can be reconciled with his views on gender\ninequality (Sticker 2020).\n\nCharacteristically, G. W. F. Hegel\u2019s (1770\u20131831) account\nof marriage synthesizes the preceding themes. Hegel returns to\nAristotle\u2019s understanding of (nuclear) marriage as the\nfoundation of a healthy state, while explicating its contribution in\nterms of spousal love. Hegel criticized Kant\u2019s reduction of\nmarriage to contract as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d because spouses\nbegin \u201cfrom the point of view of contract\u2014i.e. that of\nindividual personality as a self-sufficient unit\u2014in order to\nsupersede it.\u201d They \u201cconsent to constitute a\nsingle person and to give up their natural and individual\npersonalities within this union.\u201d The essence of marriage is\nethical love, \u201cthe consciousness of this union as a substantial\nend, and hence in love, trust, and the sharing of the whole of\nindividual existence.\u201d Ethical love is not, like sexual love,\ncontingent: \u201cMarriage should not be disrupted by passion, for\nthe latter is subordinate to it\u201d (Elements of the Philosophy\nof Right, 1821, \u00a7162\u201363, 163A).\n\nLike his predecessors, Hegel must justify the distinctive features of\nmarriage, and in particular, why, if it is the ethical love\nrelationship which is ethically significant, formal marriage is\nnecessary. Hegel\u2019s contemporary Friedrich von Schlegel had\nargued that love can exist outside marriage\u2014a point which Hegel\ndenounced as the argument of a seducer! For Hegel, ethical love\ndepends on publicly assuming spousal roles which define individuals as\nmembers in a larger unit. Such unselfish membership links marriage and\nthe state. Marriage plays an important role in Hegel\u2019s system of\nright, which culminates in ethical life, the customs and institutions\nof society: family, civil society, and the state. The role of marriage\nis to prepare men to relate to other citizens as sharers in a common\nenterprise. In taking family relationships as conditions for good\ncitizenship, Hegel follows Aristotle and influences Rawls and Sandel;\nit is also notable that he takes marriage as a microcosm of the\nstate.\n\nKant and Hegel attempted to show that the distinctive features of\nmarriage could be explained and justified by foundational normative\nprinciples. In contrast, early feminists argued that marital hierarchy\nwas simply an unjust remnant of a pre-modern era. John Stuart Mill\n(1806\u20131873) argued that women\u2019s subordination within\nmarriage originated in physical force\u2014an anomalous holdover of\nthe \u2018law of the strongest\u2019. Like Wollstonecraft in her\n1792 A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Mill compared\nmarriage and slavery: under coverture wives had no legal rights,\nlittle remedy for abuse, and, worse, were required to live in intimacy\nwith their \u2018masters\u2019. This example of an inequality based\non force had persisted so long, Mill argued, because all men had an\ninterest in retaining it. Mill challenged the contractual view that\nentry into marriage was fully voluntary for women, pointing out that\ntheir options were so limited that marriage was \u201conly\nHobson\u2019s choice, \u2018that or none\u2019\u201d (The\nSubjection of Women, 1869, 29). He also challenged the view that\nwomen\u2019s nature justified marital inequality: in light of\ndifferent socialization of girls and boys, there was no way to tell\nwhat woman\u2019s nature really was. Like Wollstonecraft, Mill\ndescribed the ideal marital relationship as one of equal friendship\n(Abbey and Den Uyl, 2001). Such marriages would be \u201cschools of\njustice\u201d for children, teaching them to treat others as equals.\nBut marital inequality was a school of injustice, teaching boys\nunearned privilege and corrupting future citizens. The comparison of\nmarriage with slavery has been taken up by more recent feminists\n(Cronan 1973), as has the argument that marital injustice creates\nunjust citizens (Okin 1994).\n\nMarxists also saw marriage as originating in ancient exercises of\nforce and as continuing to contribute to the exploitation of women.\nFriedrich Engels (1820\u20131895) argued that monogamous marriage\nissued from a \u201cworld historical defeat of the female\nsex\u201d (Engels 1884, 120). Exclusive monogamy \u201cwas not\nin any way the fruit of individual sex love, with which it had nothing\nwhatever to do \u2026 [but was based on] economic\nconditions\u2014on the victory of private property over primitive,\nnatural communal property\u201d (ibid., 128). Monogamy\nallowed men to control women and reproduction, thereby facilitating\nthe intergenerational transfer of private property by producing\nundisputed heirs. Karl Marx (1818\u201383) argued that abolishing the\nprivate family would liberate women from male ownership, ending their\nstatus \u201cas mere instruments of production\u201d (The\nCommunist Manifesto, Marx 1848, 173). The Marxist linking of\npatriarchy and capitalism, in particular its understanding of marriage\nas an ownership relation ideologically underpinning the capitalist\norder, has been especially influential in feminist thought (Pateman\n1988, cf. McMurtry 1972).\n",
