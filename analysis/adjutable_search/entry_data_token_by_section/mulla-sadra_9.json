    "main_text": "Noetics \u2014 Epistemology and Psychology || The Soul-Body relationship\n4.2 The Soul-Body relationship\n\nThe central feature of the soul-body relationship in Mulla Sadra is\nexpressed in the phrase that the soul is \u2018corporeal in its\norigination and spiritual [or incorporeal] in its survival\u2019\n(jismaniyyat al-huduth wa-ruhaniyyat al-baqa\u2019). In the\nWisdom of the Throne, he describes the birth of the soul and\nits relationship to the body through its progression to the\nafterlife:\n\nThe human soul has many stations and degrees from the beginning of its\ngeneration to the end of its goal and it has certain essential states\nand modes of existence. First, in its state of attachment to the body\nit is a corporeal substance; then it progresses gradually in intensity\nand develops through stages of its creation until it becomes\nself-subsistent and separates from this world to the next and returns\nto its Lord.\n\n\nIt is corporeal in its origination but incorporeal in its survival.\nThe first thing to be generated in its state of attachment is a\ncorporeal faculty, then a natural form, then a sensing soul in its\nlevels, then the reflective and recollective, and finally the rational\nsoul. It acquires the practical and then the theoretical intellect to\nthe limit of being an actualised intellect and finally the Active\nIntellect (Mulla Sadra 1981: 131\u20132).\n\nThe progress of the soul in this world is through the perfection of\nintellect that is the life and prime faculty of the soul. Its\nembodiment facilitates its acquisition of knowledge and the perfection\nof its intellect but also acts as a cage of restraint. What we see in\nthis passage above is the progression of the soul-intellect through\nthe five stages of the perfection of the intellect described in\nAvicenna. The soul begins as receptive potentially, then acquires the\nhabit of learning and intellecting until this is perfected; then it is\nan acquired intellect properly trained. The next stage is the ability\nof the soul to produce knowledge actively, by being an active\nintellect; finally it acquires certainty through union with the Active\nIntellect, a transcendent principle of perfect knowledge which we\ndiscuss below. The distinction between the sphere of the intellect and\nthat of the body constitutes a type of dualism that is reflected in\nMulla Sadra\u2019s distinction between mental and extra-mental\nexistence. \n",
