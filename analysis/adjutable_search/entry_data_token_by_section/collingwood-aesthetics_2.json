    "main_text": "Art as Craft, Magic, Representation and Amusement || Art as Representation\n1.2 Art as Representation\n\nAlthough as we will see in a moment Collingwood holds that there is\nmore to it than this, representation is, in the first instance, the\nrelation that a portrait bears to its sitter. It is plainly a matter\nof skill, of technique, since one can envisage a successful outcome\nbefore undertaking it. So art cannot be representation (or\n\u2018mimesis\u2019, in any straightforward sense). But the theory\nthat it is is so venerable and influential that it demands separate\nattention. (Not, however, because of Plato and Aristotle; Collingwood\nholds that despite popular opinion, they did not hold it!).\n\nCollingwood advances a very liberal notion of representation, such\nthat a great deal more artefacts than one would initially think could\nrightly qualify as representative. For the standard for fidelity is\nnot resemblance, but that the feeling evoked by the artefact resembles\nthat evoked by the original. Representation comes in three,\noverlapping degrees. The first is that of the ordinary photograph, or\npaintings and the like which attempt that sort of literalness. The\nsecond is that whereby the painter \u2013 he mentions van Gogh\n\u2013 \u2018leaves out some things that he sees, modifies others,\nand introduces some which he not does see in his sitter at all\u2019\n(53\u20134). At the extreme, he may paint mere patterns, for example,\nof a dance, leaving out the dancers. The third is \u2018emotional\nrepresentation\u2019, which represents the inner aspect of emotion,\nbut which is nevertheless distinct from expression. Some types of\nmusic, on this view, represent the mind undergoing its experiences,\nsuch the feeling of \u2018lying in deep grass on a summer\u2019s day\nwatching clouds drift across the sky\u2019 (56). Collingwood does not\nsay what the exact difference is between representation and\nexpression, but I assume that it depends first of all on whether or\nnot the artist has a clear conception of what he is trying to\nrepresent; if he does, then his activity is craft, not art proper. As\nwe will see below, this is not implausible because the artist, at\nleast according to Collingwood, does not literally know the expressive\ncontent of his artwork in advance of expressing it. It would be in\nkeeping with Collingwood\u2019s approach to add that the expressed\ncontent is individual, whereas represented contents are\nalways general; perceptually quite different works can\nrepresent exactly the same thing.\n",
