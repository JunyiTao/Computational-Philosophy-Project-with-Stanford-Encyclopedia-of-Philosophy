HESCs are characterized by their capacity for\nself-renewal and their ability to differentiate into all types of cells\nof the body. The main goal of HESC research is to identify the\nmechanisms that govern cell differentiation and to turn HESCs into\nspecific cell types that can be used for treating debilitating and\nlife-threatening diseases and injuries.\n\n\nDespite the tremendous therapeutic promise of HESC research, the\nresearch has met with heated opposition because the harvesting of HESCs\ninvolves the destruction of the human embryo. HESCs are derived in\nvitro around the fifth day of the embryo\u2019s development\n(Thomson et al. 1998). A typical day-5 human embryo\nconsists of 200\u2013250 cells, most of which comprise the trophoblast,\nwhich is the outermost layer of the blastocyst. HESCs are harvested\nfrom the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, which consists of 30\u201334\ncells. The derivation of HESC cultures requires the removal of\nthe trophoblast. This process of disaggregating the\nblastocyst\u2019s cells eliminates its potential for further\ndevelopment. Opponents of HESC research argue that the research\nis morally impermissible because it involves the unjust killing of\ninnocent human beings.\n\n\nScientists recently succeeded in converting adult human skin cells\ninto cells that appear to have the properties of HESCs by activating\nfour genes in the adult cells (Takahashi et al. 2007; Yu\net al. 2007). The reprogrammed cells\u2014\u201cinduced\npluripotent stem cells\u201d (iPSCs)\u2014could ultimately\neliminate the need for HESCs. However, at present, the consensus in\nthe scientific community is that both HESC and iPSC research should be\npursued, as we do not yet know whether iPSCs have the same potential\nas HESCs or whether it is safe to transplant them into humans. Thus,\nthe controversies around HESC research will continue, at least in the\nnear-term.\n\n\nWhile the principal source of the controversy surrounding HESC\nresearch lies in competing views about the value of human embryonic\nlife, the scope of ethical issues in HESC research is broader than the\nquestion of the ethics of destroying human embryos. It also\nencompasses questions about, among other things, whether researchers\nwho use but do not derive HESCs are complicit in the destruction of\nembryos, whether there is a moral distinction between creating embryos\nfor research purposes and creating them for reproductive ends, the\npermissibility of cloning human embryos to harvest HESCs, and the\nethics of creating human/non-human chimeras. This entry provides an\noverview of all but the last two issues just listed; cloning and\nhuman-non-human chimeras are addressed in separate entries.\n", "toc": [{"#EthDesHumEmbForRes": "1.

The Ethics of Destroying Human Embryos for Research\n\n\nThe potential therapeutic benefits of HESC research provide strong\ngrounds in favor of the research. If looked at from a strictly\nconsequentialist perspective, it\u2019s almost certainly the case that\nthe potential health benefits from the research outweigh the loss of\nembryos involved and whatever suffering results from that loss for\npersons who want to protect embryos. However, most of those who\noppose the research argue that the constraints against killing innocent\npersons to promote social utility apply to human embryos. Thus,\nas long as we accept non-consequentialist constraints on killing\npersons, those supporting HESC research must respond to the claim that\nthose constraints apply to human embryos.\n\n\nIn its most basic form, the central argument supporting the claim\nthat it is unethical to destroy human embryos goes as follows: It\nis morally impermissible to intentionally kill innocent human beings;\nthe human embryo is an innocent human being; therefore it is morally\nimpermissible to intentionally kill the human embryo. It is worth\nnoting that this argument, if sound, would not suffice to show that all\nor even most HESC research is impermissible, since most investigators\nengaged in HESC research do not participate in the derivation of HESCs\nbut instead use cell lines that researchers who performed the\nderivation have made available. To show that researchers who use\nbut do not derive HESCs participate in an immoral activity, one would\nfurther need to establish their complicity in the destruction of\nembryos. We will consider this issue in section 2. But for\nthe moment, let us address the argument that it is unethical to destroy\nhuman embryos.\n1.1 When does a human being begin to exist?\n\n\nA premise of the argument against killing embryos is that human\nembryos are human beings. The issue of when a human being begins\nto exist is, however, a contested one. The standard view of those\nwho oppose HESC research is that a human being begins to exist with the\nemergence of the one-cell zygote at fertilization. At this stage,\nhuman embryos are said to be \u201cwhole living member[s] of the\nspecies homo sapiens \u2026 [which] possess the epigenetic primordia\nfor self-directed growth into adulthood, with their determinateness and\nidentity fully intact\u201d (George & Gomez-Lobo 2002,\n258). This view is sometimes challenged on the grounds that\nmonozygotic twinning is possible until around days 14\u201315 of an\nembryo\u2019s development (Smith & Brogaard 2003). An\nindividual who is an identical twin cannot be numerically identical to\nthe one-cell zygote, since both twins bear the same relationship to the\nzygote, and numerical identity must satisfy transitivity. That\nis, if the zygote, A, divides into two genetically identical cell\ngroups that give rise to identical twins B and C, B and C cannot be the\nsame individual as A because they are not numerically identical with\neach other. This shows that not all persons can correctly assert\nthat they began their life as a zygote. However, it does not\nfollow that the zygote is not a human being, or that it has not\nindividuated. This would follow only if one held that a condition of an\nentity\u2019s status as an individual human being is that it be\nimpossible for it to cease to exist by dividing into two or more\nentities. But this seems implausible. Consider cases in\nwhich we imagine adult humans undergoing fission (for example, along\nthe lines of Parfit\u2019s thought experiments, where each half of the\nbrain is implanted into a different body) (Parfit 1984). The\nprospect of our going out of existence through fission does not pose a\nthreat to our current status as distinct human persons. Likewise,\none might argue, the fact that a zygote may divide does not create\nproblems for the view that the zygote is a distinct human being.\n\n\nThere are, however, other grounds on which some have sought to\nreject that the early human embryo is a human being. According to\none view, the cells that comprise the early embryo are a bundle of\nhomogeneous cells that exist in the same membrane but do not form a\nhuman organism because the cells do not function in a coordinated way\nto regulate and preserve a single life (Smith & Brogaard 2003,\nMcMahan 2002). While each of the cells is alive, they only become\nparts of a human organism when there is substantial cell\ndifferentiation and coordination, which occurs around day-16 after\nfertilization. Thus, on this account, disaggregating the cells of\nthe 5-day embryo to derive HESCs does not entail the destruction of a\nhuman being.\n\n\nThis account is subject to dispute on empirical grounds. That there is\nsome intercellular coordination in the zygote is revealed by the fact\nthat the development of the early embryo requires that some cells\nbecome part of the trophoblast while others become part of the inner\ncell mass. Without some coordination between the cells, there would be\nnothing to prevent all cells from differentiating in the same\ndirection (Damschen, Gomez-Lobo and Schonecker 2006). The question\nremains, though, whether this degree of cellular interaction is\nsufficient to render the early human embryo a human being. Just how\nmuch intercellular coordination must exist for a group of cells to\nconstitute a human organism cannot be resolved by scientific facts\nabout the embryo, but is instead an open metaphysical question\n(McMahan 2007a).\n1.2 The moral status of human embryos\n\n\nSuppose that the 5-day human embryo is a human being. On the\nstandard argument against HESC research, membership in the species\nHomo sapiens confers on the embryo a right not to be\nkilled. This view is grounded in the assumption that human beings\nhave the same moral status (at least with respect to possessing this\nright) at all stages of their lives.\n\n\nSome accept that the human embryo is a human being but argue that\nthe human embryo does not have the moral status requisite for a right\nto life. There is reason to think that species membership is not\nthe property that determines a being\u2019s moral status. We\nhave all been presented with the relevant thought experiments, courtesy\nof Disney, Orwell, Kafka, and countless science fiction works. The\nresults seem clear: we regard mice, pigs, insects, aliens, and so on,\nas having the moral status of persons in those possible worlds in which\nthey exhibit the psychological and cognitive traits that we normally\nassociate with mature human beings. This suggests that it is some\nhigher-order mental capacity (or capacities) that grounds the right to\nlife. While there is no consensus about the capacities that\nare necessary for the right to life, some of the capacities that have\nbeen proposed include reasoning, self-awareness, and agency (Kuhse\n& Singer 1992, Tooley 1983, Warren 1973).\n\n\nThe main difficulty for those who appeal to such mental capacities\nas the touchstone for the right to life is that early human infants\nlack these capacities, and do so to a greater degree than many of the\nnonhuman animals that most deem it acceptable to kill (Marquis\n2002). This presents a challenge for those who hold that the\nnon-consequentialist constraints on killing human children and adults\napply to early human infants. Some reject that these constraints apply\nto infants, and allow that there may be circumstances where it is\npermissible to sacrifice infants for the greater good (McMahan\n2007b). Others argue that, while infants do not have the\nintrinsic properties that ground a right to life, we should nonetheless\ntreat them as if they have a right to life in order to promote love and\nconcern towards them, as these attitudes have good consequences for the\npersons they will become (Benn 1973, Strong 1997).\n\n\nSome claim that we can reconcile the ascription of a right to life to\nall humans with the view that higher order mental capacities ground\nthe right to life by distinguishing between two senses of mental\ncapacities: \u201cimmediately exercisable\u201d capacities and\n\u201cbasic natural\u201d capacities. (George and Gomez-Lobo 2002,\n260). According to this view, an individual\u2019s immediately exercisable\ncapacity for higher mental functions is the actualization of natural\ncapacities for higher mental functions that exist at the embryonic\nstage of life. Human embryos have a \u201crational nature,\u201d but\nthat nature is not fully realized until individuals are able to\nexercise their capacity to reason. The difference between these types\nof capacity is said to be a difference between degrees of development\nalong a continuum.  There is merely a quantitative difference between\nthe mental capacities of embryos, fetuses, infants, children, and\nadults (as well as among infants, children, and adults). And this\ndifference, so the argument runs, cannot justify treating some of\nthese individuals with moral respect while denying it to others.\n\n\nGiven that a human embryo cannot reason at all, the claim that it\nhas a rational nature has struck some as tantamount to asserting that\nit has the potential to become an individual that can engage in\nreasoning (Sagan & Singer 2007). But an entity\u2019s\nhaving this potential does not logically entail that it has the same\nstatus as beings that have realized some or all of their potential\n(Feinberg 1986). Moreover, with the advent of cloning\ntechnologies, the range of entities that we can now identify as\npotential persons arguably creates problems for those who place great\nmoral weight on the embryo\u2019s potential. A single somatic\ncell or HESC can in principle (though not yet in practice) develop into\na mature human being under the right conditions\u2014that is, where\nthe cell\u2019s nucleus is transferred into an enucleated egg, the new\negg is electrically stimulated to create an embryo, and the embryo is\ntransferred to a woman\u2019s uterus and brought to term. If the\nbasis for protecting embryos is that they have the potential to become\nreasoning beings, then, some argue, we have reason to ascribe a high\nmoral status to the trillions of cells that share this potential and to\nassist as many of these cells as we reasonably can to realize their\npotential (Sagan & Singer 2007, Savulescu 1999).\nBecause this is a stance that we can expect nearly everyone to reject,\nit\u2019s not clear that opponents of HESC research can effectively\nground their position in the human embryo\u2019s potential.\n\n\nOne response to this line of argument has been to claim that embryos\npossess a kind of potential that somatic cells and HESCs lack. An\nembryo has potential in the sense of having an \u201cactive\ndisposition\u201d and \u201cintrinsic power\u201d to develop into a\nmature human being (Lee & George 2006). An embryo can\nmature on its own in the absence of interference with its development.\nA somatic cell, on the other hand, does not have the inherent capacity\nor disposition to grow into a mature human being. However, some\nquestion whether this distinction is viable, especially in the HESC\nresearch context. While it is true that somatic cells can realize\ntheir potential only with the assistance of outside interventions, an\nembryo\u2019s development also requires that numerous conditions\nexternal to it are satisfied. In the case of embryos that are\nnaturally conceived, they must implant, receive nourishment, and avoid\nexposure to dangerous substances in utero. In the case\nof spare embryos created through in vitro fertilization\u2014which\nare presently the source of HESCs for research\u2014the embryos must\nbe thawed and transferred to a willing woman\u2019s\nuterus. Given the role that external factors\u2014including \ntechnological interventions\u2014play in an embryo\u2019s\nrealizing its potential, one can question whether there is a morally\nrelevant distinction between an embryo\u2019s and somatic cell\u2019s\npotential and thus raise doubts about potentiality as a foundation for\nthe right to life (Devolder & Harris 2007).\n\n\nSome grant that human embryos lack the properties essential to a\nright to life, but hold that they possess an intrinsic value that calls\nfor a measure of respect and places at least some moral constraints on\ntheir use: \u201cThe life of a single human organism commands\nrespect and protection \u2026 no matter in what form or shape,\nbecause of the complex creative investment it represents and because of\nour wonder at the divine or evolutionary processes that produce new\nlives from old ones.\u201d (Dworkin l992, 84). There are,\nhowever, divergent views about the level of respect embryos command and\nwhat limits exist on their use. Some opponents of HESC research\nhold that the treatment of human embryos as mere research tools always\nfails to manifest proper respect for them. Other opponents take a\nless absolutist view. Some, for example, deem embryos less\nvaluable than more mature human beings but argue that the benefits of\nHESC research are too speculative to warrant the destruction of\nembryos, and that the benefits might, in any case, be achieved through\nthe use of noncontroversial sources of stem cells (e.g., adult stem\ncells) (Holm 2003).\n\n\nMany, if not most, who support the use of human embryos for HESC\nresearch would likely agree with opponents of the research that there\nare some circumstances where the use of human embryos would display a\nlack of appropriate respect for human life, for example, were they to\nbe offered for consumption to contestants in a reality TV competition\nor destroyed for the production of cosmetics. But proponents of the\nresearch hold that the value of human embryos is not great enough to\nconstrain the pursuit of research that may yield significant\ntherapeutic benefits. Supporters of the research also frequently\nquestion whether most opponents of the research are consistent in their\nascription of a high value to human embryos, as opponents generally\ndisplay little concern about the fact that many embryos created for\nfertility treatment are discarded.\n1.3 The case of \u201cdoomed embryos\u201d\n\n\nWhen spare embryos exist after fertility treatment, the individuals\nfor whom the embryos were created typically have the option of storing\nfor them for future reproductive use, donating them to other infertile\ncouples, donating them to research, or discarding them. Some\nargue that as long as the decision to donate embryos for research is\nmade after the decision to discard them, it is morally permissible to\nuse them in HESC research even if we assume that they have the moral\nstatus of persons. The claim takes two different forms. One is\nthat it is morally permissible to kill an individual who is about to be\nkilled by someone else where killing that individual will help others\n(Curzer, H. 2004). The other is that researchers who derive HESCs\nfrom embryos that were slated for destruction do not cause their\ndeath. Instead, the decision to discard the embryos causes their\ndeath; research just causes the manner of their death (Green \n2002).\n\n\nBoth versions of the argument presume that the decision to discard\nspare embryos prior to the decision to donate them to research entails\nthat donated embryos are doomed to destruction when researchers receive\nthem. There are two arguments one might marshal against this\npresumption. First, one who wants to donate embryos to research\nmight first elect to discard them only because doing so is a\nprecondition for donating them. There could be cases in which one\nwho chooses the discard option would have donated the embryos to other\ncouples were the research donation option not available. The fact\nthat a decision to discard embryos is made prior to the decision to\ndonate the embryos thus does not establish that the embryos were doomed\nto destruction before the decision to donate them to research was\nmade. Second, a researcher who receives embryos could choose to\nrescue them, whether by continuing to store them or by donating them to\ninfertile couples. While this would violate the law, the fact\nthat it is within a researcher\u2019s power to prevent the destruction\nof the embryos he or she receives poses problems for the claim that the\ndecision to discard the embryos dooms them or causes their\ndestruction.\n2. The Ethics of Using Human Embryonic Stem Cells in Research\n\n\nAssume for the sake of argument that it is morally impermissible to\ndestroy human embryos. It does not follow that all research with HESCs\nis impermissible, as it is sometimes permissible to benefit from moral\nwrongs. For example, there is nothing objectionable about\ntransplant surgeons and patients benefiting from the organs of murder\nand drunken driving victims (Robertson 1988). If there are\nconditions under which a researcher may use HESCs without being\ncomplicit in the destruction of embryos, then those who oppose the\ndestruction of embryos could support research with HESCs under certain\ncircumstances.\n\n\nResearchers using HESCs are clearly implicated in the destruction of\nembryos where they derive the cells themselves or enlist others to\nderive the cells. However, most investigators who conduct\nresearch with HESCs obtain them from an existing pool of cell lines and\nplay no role in their derivation. One view is that we cannot assign\ncausal or moral responsibility to investigators for the destruction of\nembryos from which the HESCs they use are derived where their\n\u201cresearch plans had no effect on whether the original immoral\nderivation occurred.\u201d (Robertson 1999). This view\nrequires qualification. There may be cases in which HESCs are\nderived for the express purpose of making them widely available to HESC\ninvestigators. In such instances, it may be that no individual\nresearcher\u2019s plans motivated the derivation of the cells.\nNonetheless, one might argue that investigators who use these cells are\ncomplicit in the destruction of the embryos from which the cells were\nderived because they are participants in a research enterprise that\ncreates a demand for HESCs. For these investigators to avoid the charge\nof complicity in the destruction of embryos, it must be the case that\nthe researchers who derived the HESCs would have performed the\nderivation in the absence of external demand for the cells (Siegel\n2004).\n\n\nThe issue about complicity goes beyond the question of an HESC\nresearcher\u2019s role in the destruction of the particular human\nembryo(s) from which the cells he or she uses are derived. There\nis a further concern that research with existing HESCs will result in\nthe future destruction of embryos: \u201c[I]f this research\nleads to possible treatments, private investment in such efforts will\nincrease greatly and the demand for many thousands of cell lines with\ndifferent genetic profiles will be difficult to resist.\u201d (U.S.\nConference of Catholic Bishops 2001). This objection faces two\ndifficulties. First, it appears to be too sweeping:\nresearch with adult stem cells and non-human animal stem cells, as well\nas general research in genetics, embryology, and cell biology could be\nimplicated, since all of this research might advance our understanding\nof HESCs and result in increased demand for them. Yet, no one,\nincluding those who oppose HESC research, argues that we should not\nsupport these areas of research. Second, the claim about future\ndemand for HESCs is speculative. Indeed, current HESC research\ncould ultimately reduce or eliminate demand for the cells by providing\ninsights into cell biology that enable the use of alternative sources\nof cells (Siegel 2004). \n\n\nWhile it might thus be possible for a researcher to use HESCs\nwithout being morally responsible for the destruction of human embryos,\nthat does not end the inquiry into complicity. Some argue that\nagents can be complicit in wrongful acts for which they are not morally\nresponsible. One such form of complicity arises from an\nassociation with wrongdoing that symbolizes acquiescence in the\nwrongdoing (Burtchaell 1989). The failure to take\nappropriate measures to distance oneself from moral wrongs may give\nrise to \u201cmetaphysical guilt,\u201d which produces a moral taint\nand for which shame is the appropriate response (May 1992).\nThe following question thus arises: Assuming it is morally\nwrongful to destroy human embryos, are HESC researchers who are not\nmorally responsible for the destruction of embryos complicit in the\nsense of symbolically aligning themselves with a wrongful act?\n\n\nOne response is that a researcher who benefits from the destruction\nof embryos need not sanction the act any more than the transplant\nsurgeon who uses the organs of a murder or drunken driving victim\nsanctions the homicidal act (Curzer 2004). But this response\nis unlikely to be satisfactory to opponents of HESC research.\nThere is arguably an important difference between the transplant case\nand HESC research insofar as the moral wrong associated with the latter\n(a) systematically devalues a particular class of human beings and (b)\nis largely socially accepted and legally permitted. Opponents of HESC\nresearch might suggest that the HESC research case is more analogous to\nthe following kind of case: Imagine a society in which the\npractice of killing members of a particular racial or ethnic group is\nlegally permitted and generally accepted. Suppose that biological\nmaterials obtained from these individuals subsequent to their deaths\nare made available for research uses. Could researchers use these\nmaterials while appropriately distancing themselves from the wrongful\npractice? Arguably, they could not. There is a heightened\nneed to protest moral wrongs where those wrongs are socially and\nlegally accepted. Attempts to benefit from the moral wrong in these\ncircumstances may be incompatible with mounting a proper protest\n(Siegel 2003).\n\n\nBut even if we assume that HESC researchers cannot avoid the taint\nof metaphysical guilt, it is not clear that researchers who bear no\nmoral responsibility for the destruction of embryos are morally\nobligated not to use HESCs. One might argue that there is a prima\nfacie duty to avoid moral taint, but that this duty may be overridden\nfor the sake of a noble cause.\n3. The Ethics of Creating Embryos for Stem Cell Research and Therapy\n\n\nMost HESCs are derived from embryos that were created for infertility\ntreatment but that were in excess of what the infertile individual(s)\nultimately needed to achieve a pregnancy. The HESCs derived from these\nleftover embryos offer investigators a powerful tool for understanding\nthe mechanisms controlling cell differentiation.  However, there are\nscientific and therapeutic reasons not to rely entirely on leftover\nembryos. From a research standpoint, creating embryos through cloning\ntechnologies with cells that are known to have particular genetic\nmutations would allow researchers to study the underpinnings of\ngenetic diseases in vitro. From a therapeutic standpoint, the\nHESCs obtained from leftover IVF embryos are not genetically diverse\nenough to address the problem of immune rejection by recipients of\nstem cell transplants.  (Induced pluripotent stem cells may ultimately\nprove sufficient for these research and therapeutic ends, since the\ncells can (a) be selected for specific genetic mutations and (b)\nprovide an exact genetic match for stem cell recipients.)  At present,\nthe best way to address the therapeutic problem is through the\ncreation of a public stem cell bank that represents a genetically\ndiverse pool of stem cell lines (Faden et al. 2003, Lott &\nSavulescu 2007). This kind of stem cell bank would require the\ncreation of embryos from gamete donors who share the same HLA-types\n(i.e., similar versions of the genes that mediate immune recognition\nand rejection).\n\n\nEach of these enterprises has its own set of ethical issues.  In the\ncase of research cloning, some raise concerns, for example, that the\nperfection of cloning techniques for research purposes will enable the\npursuit of reproductive cloning, and that efforts to obtain the\nthousands of eggs required for the production of cloned embryos will\nresult in the exploitation of women who provide the eggs (President\u2019s\nCouncil on Bioethics 2002, Norsigian 2005). With respect to stem cell\nbanks, it is not practically possible to create a bank of HESCs that\nwill provide a close immunological match for all recipients. This\ngives rise to the challenge of determining who will have biological\naccess to stem cell therapies. We might construct the bank so that it\nprovides matches for the greatest number of people in the population,\ngives everyone an equal chance of finding a match, or ensures that all\nancestral/ethnic groups are fairly represented in the bank (Faden\net al. 2003, Bok, Schill, & Faden 2004, Greene 2006).\n\n\nThere are, however, more general challenges to the creation of embryos\nfor research and therapeutic purposes. Some argue that the creation of\nembryos for non-reproductive ends is morally problematic, regardless\nof whether they are created through cloning or in vitro\nfertilization. There are two related arguments that have been advanced\nto morally distinguish the creation of embryos for reproductive\npurposes from the creation of embryos for research and therapeutic\npurposes. First, each embryo created for procreative purposes is\noriginally viewed as a potential child in the sense that each is a\ncandidate for implantation and development into a mature human. In\ncontrast, embryos created for research or therapies are viewed as mere\ntools from the outset (Annas, Caplan & Elias 1996, President\u2019s\nCouncil on Bioethics 2002). Second, while embryos created for research\nand therapy are produced with the intent to destroy them, the\ndestruction of embryos created for reproduction is a foreseeable but\nunintended consequence of their creation (FitzPatrick 2003).\n\n\nOne response to the first argument has been to suggest that we\ncould, under certain conditions, view all research embryos as potential\nchildren in the relevant sense. If all research embryos were\nincluded in a lottery in which some of them were donated to individuals\nfor reproductive purposes, all research embryos would have a chance at\ndeveloping into mature humans (Devander 2005). Since\nthose who oppose creating embryos for research would likely maintain\ntheir opposition in the research embryo lottery case, it is arguably\nirrelevant whether embryos are viewed as potential children when they\nare created. Of course, research embryos in the lottery case would be\nviewed as both potential children and potential research tools.\nBut this is also true in the case of embryos created for reproductive\npurposes where patients are open to donating spare embryos to\nresearch.\n\n\nAs to the second argument, the distinction between intending and\nmerely foreseeing harms is one to which many people attach moral\nsignificance, and it is central to the Doctrine of Double Effect.\nBut even if one holds that this is a morally significant distinction,\nit is not clear that it is felicitous to characterize the destruction\nof spare embryos as an unintended but foreseeable side-effect of\ncreating embryos for fertility treatment. Fertility clinics do\nnot merely foresee that some embryos will be destroyed, as they choose\nto offer patients the option of discarding embryos and carry out the\ndisposal of embryos when patients request it. Patients who elect\nthat their embryos be discarded also do not merely foresee the\nembryos\u2019 destruction; their election of that option manifests\ntheir intention that the embryos be destroyed. There is thus\nreason to doubt that there is a moral distinction between creating\nembryos for research and creating them for reproductive purposes, at\nleast given current fertility clinic practices.\n 4. Stem Cell-Derived Gametes \n\n\nRecent scientific work suggests it is possible to derive gametes from human pluripotent stem cells.  Researchers have generated sperm and eggs from mouse ESCs and iPSCs and have used these stem cell-derived gametes to produce offspring (Hayashi 2011; Hayashi 2012).\nWhile it may take several years before researchers succeed in deriving gametes from human stem cells, the research holds much promise for basic science and clinical application.  For example, the research could provide important insights into the fundamental processes of gamete biology, assist in the understanding of genetic disorders, and provide otherwise infertile individuals a means of creating genetically related children.  The ability to derive gametes from human stem cells could also reduce or eliminate the need for egg donors and thus help overcome concerns about exploitation of donors and the risks involved in egg retrieval.  Nonetheless, the research gives rise to some controversial issues related to embryos, genetics, and assisted reproductive technologies (D. Mathews et al. 2009).\n\n\nOne issue arises from the fact that some research on stem cell-derived\ngametes requires the creation of embryos, regardless of whether one is\nusing ESCs or iPSCs.  To establish that a particular technique for\nderiving human gametes from stem cells produces functional sperm and\neggs, it is necessary to demonstrate that the cells can produce an\nembryo.  This entails the creation of embryos through in vitro\nfertilization.  Since it would not be safe to implant embryos created\nduring the early stages of the research, the likely disposition of the\nembryos is that they would be destroyed.  In such instances, the\nresearch would implicate all of the moral issues surrounding the\ncreation and destruction of embryos for research.  However, the\ncreation of embryos for research in this situation would not\nnecessitate the destruction of the embryos, as it does when embryos\nare created to derive stem cell lines.  One could in principle store\nthem indefinitely rather than destroy them.  This would still leave \none subject to the objection that life is being created for\ninstrumental purposes.  But the force of the objection is questionable\nsince it is not clear that this instrumental use is any more\nobjectionable than the routine and widely accepted practice of\ncreating excess IVF embryos in the reproductive context to increase\nthe probability of generating a sufficient number of viable ones to\nproduce a pregnancy. \n Further issues emerge with the prospect of being able to produce\nlarge quantities of eggs from stem cells.  As the capacity to identify\ndisease and non-disease related alleles through preimplantation\ngenetic diagnosis (PGD) expands, the ability to create large numbers\nof embryos would substantially increase the chances of finding an\nembryo that possesses most or all of the traits one wishes to select.\nThis would be beneficial in preventing the birth of children with\ngenetic diseases.  But matters would become morally contentious if it\nwere possible to select for non-disease characteristics, such as\nsexual orientation, height, superior intelligence, memory, and musical\nability.  One common argument against using PGD in this way is that it\ncould devalue the lives of those who do not exhibit the chosen\ncharacteristics.  Another concern is that employing PGD to select for\nnon-disease traits would fail to acknowledge the \u201cgiftedness of\nlife\u201d by treating children as \u201cobjects of our design or\nproducts of our will or instruments of our ambition\u201d rather\naccepting them as they are given to us (Sandel 2004, 56).  There is\nadditionally a concern about advances in genetics heightening\ninequalities where certain traits confer social and economic\nadvantages and only the well-off have the resources to access the\ntechnology (Buchanan 1995).  Of course, one can question whether the\nselection of non-disease traits would in fact lead to devaluing other\ncharacteristics, whether it would alter the nature of parental love,\nor whether it is distinct enough from currently permitted methods of\ngaining social and economic advantage to justify regulating the\npractice.  Nonetheless, the capacity to produce human stem\ncell-derived gametes would make these issues more pressing. \n5. Stem Cell-Derived Organoids, Gastruloids, and Synthetic Embryos\n\n\nThere have been a number of recent scientific studies in which stem\ncells have, under certain in vitro culture conditions,\nself-organized into three-dimensional structures that resemble and\nrecapitulate some of the functions of human organs (Lancaster &\nKnoblich 2014; Clevers 2016). These \u201corganoids\u201d have been\nestablished with human stem cells for a variety of organs, including,\namong others, the kidney, liver, gut, pancreas, retina, and brain. In\naddition to organoids, stem cells have been shown to self-organize\ninto embryo-like structures in vitro. Human embryonic stem\ncells have formed structures \u2013 referred to as\n\u201cgastruloids\u201d \u2013 that bear some resemblance to\nembryos during gastrulation, which is the stage several days after\nimplantation where the body plan and some tissues tissue types,\nincluding the central nervous system, start to develop (Warmflash et\nal. 2014; Deglincerti et al. 2016; Shahbazi 2016). Researchers have\nalso combined mouse embryonic stem cells and trophoblast stem cells to\ncreate \u201csynthetic embryos,\u201d which have a structure akin to\npre-implantation embryos (Rivron et al. 2018). Synthetic embryos have\nbeen shown to implant into the mouse uterus, though their potential to\ndevelop to term has not been demonstrated.\n\nWhile these scientific advances offer promising avenues for better\nunderstanding human development and disease, they also raise some\nnovel and challenging ethical issues. In the case of organoids,\ncerebral organoids raise the most vexing issues. Researchers have\nproduced cerebral organoids with a degree of development similar to\nthat of a few-months-old embryo, and have already used them to study\nhow the Zika virus causes microcephaly in fetuses (Garcez et al.\n2016). At present, there is some evidence that cerebral organoids may\nbe able to receive afferent stimulations that produce simple\nsensations (Quadrato et al. 2017). However, they currently lack the\nkind of mature neural networks and sensory inputs and outputs\nessential to the development of cognition. If, through bioengineering,\nhuman cerebral organoids were to develop the capacity for cognition,\nthat would provide grounds for ascribing an elevated moral status to\nthem, and it would raise concomitant issues about our moral\nobligations towards them. In the nearer term, it is more likely that\ncerebral organoids will develop some degree of consciousness Assuming\nwe have a shared understanding of consciousness (e.g., phenomenal\nconsciousness), one challenge is to identify means of measuring the\npresence of consciousness, since a cerebral organoid cannot\ncommunicate its internal states (Lavazza & Massimini 2018). But\neven if we can verify that an organoid is conscious, there remains the\nquestion of the moral significance of consciousness (Shepherd\n2018). There is debate over whether consciousness has intrinsic value\n(Lee 2018), and whether in some cases it is better for a conscious\nbeing to not possess it (Kahane & Savulescu 2009). Those who\nreject the intrinsic value and moral significance of consciousness\nmight find the case of a conscious entity that has led a solely\ndisembodied existence, emerges and persists in the absence of any\nsocial or cultural nexus, and lacks beliefs and desires, to be a\nparadigmatic case where the value of consciousness is doubtful.\n With respect to gastruloids and synthetic embryos (if the latter\nare successfully produced with human stem cells), the central question\nis whether these entities are sufficiently like human embryos in their\nstructure and functions to give rise to moral concerns about their use\nin research. Gastruloids do not possess all the characteristics of an\nembryo, as they do not form all of the embryonic tissues (e.g., they\ndo not have the trophectoderm, which mediates the attachment to the\nuterus). At the same time, gastruloids may, with extra-embryonic\ntissues, achieve a developmental stage in which they manifest a whole\nbody plan. Recall that one argument (discussed in Section 1.1 above)\nfor rejecting that human embryos are human beings is that the cells\nthat comprise the early embryo do not function in a coordinated way to\nregulate and preserve a single organism. Gastruloids can in principle\noperate with this higher level of coordination. While one may still\nreject that this characteristic of gastruloids confers human rights on\nthem, their more advanced stage of development might ground reasonable\nclaims for according them greater respect than embryos at an earlier\nstage.  In the case of both gastruloids and human synthetic embryos,\nthe possibility that they ultimately lack the potential to develop\ninto mature human beings may be of significance in morally\ndistinguishing them from normal human embryos. As noted previously (in\nsection 1.2 above), one argument for ascribing a high moral status to\nhuman embryos and for distinguishing the potential of human embryos\nfrom the potential of somatic cells and embryonic stem cells is that\nembryos have an \u201cactive disposition\u201d and \u201cintrinsic\npower\u201d to develop into mature humans on their own. If synthetic\nembryos and gastruloids do not possess this disposition and power,\nthen those who oppose some forms of human embryo research might not\nobject to the creation and use of human gastruloids and synthetic\nembryos for research.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Annas, G., Caplan, A., and Elias, S., 1996, \u201cThe Politics of\nHuman-Embryo Research\u2014Avoiding Ethical Gridlock,\u201d\n<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, 334: 1329\u201332.", "Benn, S.I., 1973, \u201cAbortion, Infanticide, and Respect for\nPersons,\u201d in <em>The Problem of Abortion</em>, Joel\nFeinberg (ed.), Belmont, CA: Wadsworth: 92\u2013103.", "Bok H., Schill K.E., and Faden R.R., 2004, \u201cJustice, Ethnicity,\nand Stem-Cell Banks,\u201d <em>Lancet</em>, 364(9429): 118\u201321.", "Buchanan, A., 1995, \u201cEqual Opportunity and Genetic\nIntervention,\u201d <em>Social Philosophy and Policy</em>, 12(2):\n105\u201335.", "Burtchaell, J.T., 1989, \u201cThe Use of Aborted Fetal Tissue in\nResearch: A Rebuttal,\u201d <em>IRB: A Review of Human Subjects\nResearch</em>, 11(2): 9\u201312.", "Curzer, H., 2004, \u201cThe Ethics of Embryonic Stem Cell\nResearch,\u201d <em>Journal of Medicine and Philosophy</em>, 29(5):\n533\u2013562.", "Damschen, G., Gomez-Lobo, A., and Schonecker, D., 2006, \u201cSixteen\nDays?
