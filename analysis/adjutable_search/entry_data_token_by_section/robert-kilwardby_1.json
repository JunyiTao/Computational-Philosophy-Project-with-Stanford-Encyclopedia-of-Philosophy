    "main_text": "The Theory of the soul and the plurality of substantial forms\n2. The Theory of the soul and the plurality of substantial forms\n\nA human being is a composite of two substances, the body and the soul\n(DOS 316). The soul is the act and form of the whole (totius)\nhuman body (NLPor 8, P 38vb), and it is present wholly in every part\nof the body (in qualibet parte corporis tota). To be present\nwholly in every part does not require simplicity, as absence of\ncomposition, but spirituality (that is, immateriality) (E 6,\n47\u201348).\n\nAccording to Kilwardby, the human soul is a composite of three forms\n(potentiae): vegetative, sensitive, and intellective. The\nvegetative and sensitive are qualified as the principles of life\nbecause through them the being performs the operations of life. Like\nmost of his contemporaries, Kilwardby claims a double origin for the\nparts of the human soul: the vegetative and sensitive result from\nnatural generation, that is, they are educed from the active\npotentiality of matter, whereas the intellective soul is created\ndirectly by God. It is created as the perfection of the human body and\nas a hoc aliquid (E 5; QLIIS 138, 370), that is, an\nindividual in the genus of substance. The intellective soul is a\nspiritual substance of the rational kind, but is not a person because\nit is part of another thing\u2014a human being (QLIII1S 8, 36). The\nsoul constitutes a person only when united with the body in an actual\nexisting human being (QLIII1S 10, 52). A human being is constituted by\nthe rational soul and the body (E 7, 51).\n\nThis difference in genesis explains the different nature of the\nintellective form with respect to the other forms: whereas the\nvegetative and the sensitive forms are defined as acts of the body,\nthe intellective form is the actuality of no part of the body and so\nis the act of the sensitive body in the sense of being its perfection:\nit is the completion of the process of development, by making it a\nfull member of the human species. The relation of the intellective\nform to the body is that of the sailor to the ship (sicut nauta\nnavi), but this union is accidental only from the point of view\nof its operations\u2014such as in understanding, where the\nintellective soul does not need bodily organs (DOS 56)\u2014but not\nfrom the point of view of the essence of the intellective soul (DOS\n53).\n\nAn essential feature of the intellective soul is its natural desire\nand inclination (appetitus et inclinatio naturalis) to be\nunited to a body capable of sensation (as it \u201chates\u201d being\nseparated from it; DOS 358). The intellective soul can exist without\nthe body, but it is not created to exist without it, as it has, on the\ncontrary, a natural inclination to be united with it. It is this\n\u2018unibility\u2019 that differentiates it from the angelic\nintellective soul (in the same way as the human body is differentiated\nfrom the bodies of other animals; QLIIS 7, 26). In Kilwardby\u2019s own\nwords, \u201cthe [human] soul is born to move and to perfect the\nbody, and in this way it differs from an angel\u201d (see also QLIIS\n6; in this he follows Bonaventure). The intellective soul is the\nspecific (completive) difference in both, but it differs in species:\nwhereas the human intellective soul is created to be united with a\nbody, the angelic intellective soul is non-united with a body (QLIIS\n6, 23\u201324; 7, 26). This unibility (unibilitas) or\naptitude to be united with the body is not an accidental feature but\nsomething essential to the human intellective soul (QLIIS 7, 27).\n\nThe utmost justification for this unibility is the intellective soul\u2019s\nnatural capacity to know everything\u2014an application of the\nAristotelian principle that human beings desire to know everything.\nThe rational soul is born (nata est) to know things in a\ntwofold manner. The intellect can turn itself to the eternal, superior\nreasons, but can also turn its attention both to the images of\nsensible things received through the senses and abstracted from the\nphantasms (DSF 25; QLIII2S 24, 84). In so far as knowledge of material\nthings depends on the use of the senses, the intellective soul can\nonly fulfill its perfection by means of its union with the body (QLIIS\n8, 32).\n\nOnce infused by God, the intellective form connects the previous forms\ninherent in the body of the embryo (vegetative and sensitive) and\nconstitutes with them a human rational soul, \u201cin much the same\nway as a quadrangle, which in fact contains two triangles would become\na pentagon, if a triangle were added to one of its sides\u201d (D43Q\n34, 37; see also E 5, 42). The addition of the new triangle to the\nexisting quadrangle\u2014composite of two triangles\u2014does not\ncause the corruption of the existing figures, but rather complements\nand completes them. In the case of the soul, it means that the\nvegetative and sensitive potentiae continue to be responsible\nfor their operations after the infusion of the completive intellective\npotentia. The result is the thesis of a pluarlity of forms in\nthe human soul.\n\nKilwardby\u2019s theory of the soul is formulated around the central\nconceptions of unity and composition, rather than those of unicity and\nsimplicity. According to Kilwardby, \u201call composite things have\nunity, even though they do not have simplicity\u201d (E 6, 47),\nmeaning that complexity is not incompatible with unity, only with\nsimplicity. What is required in addition is only a principle strong\nenough to justify the unity. He thinks to have found it in what we\ncould call \u2018the principle of ordination\u2019: a substance can be composite\nand nevertheless one when the essentially different parts are ordered\nto each other (ad invicem), from the less to the more\ncomplete. A human being has \u201cone form which is not simple\n(simplex) but a composite of many [potentiae] having\na natural order to each other\u201d (E 7,\n 53).[4]\n These forms are organized in a hierarchical structure so that\nthere is one which is the perfection of the whole composite. In the\ncase of human beings, that last completive form is the intellective\nsoul.\n\nBefore continuing the examination of Kilwardby\u2019s theory of the human\nsoul, some terminological remarks are in order: Kilwardby uses the\nterm potentiae mostly to refer to the vegetative, sensitive,\nand intellective souls. There are some exceptions, where he uses\nformae and even formae substantiales, but the rule\nis potentiae. For the most part, I leave the term\n\u2018potentia\u2019 un-translated because the options are\nproblematic: \u2018power\u2019 should be used to translate\n\u2018virtus\u2019 in the sense of \u2018faculty\u2019 (for\nexample, memory is a power of the soul); \u2018potency\u2019 should\nbe avoided in order not to confuse it with potentiality, as in active\npotency; \u2018soul\u2019 is misleading because most (if not all)\npluralists claimed that there is only one soul in any individual human\nbeing\u2014the disagreement between them and unitarians is about\nwhether there is one or many potentiae in a individual human\nsoul rather than whether there is one or many souls in a individual\nhuman being; \u2018form\u2019 is a too general term\u2014however,\nfor the sake of simplicity I sometimes shall use it, namely in the\ncontext of the debate over unicity versus the plurality of substantial\nforms as that is the traditional designation of the debate. I\nthoroughly use the term \u2018unicity\u2019 to refer to the view\naccording to which the soul is simple, being only one form. Unity is\noften used in scholarship, but I find it problematic because\npluralists\u2014such as Kilwardby\u2014also argue for the unity of\nthe soul, as said above, only disagreeing about its simple (versus\ncomposite) nature. Finally, I use \u2018intellective\u2019 soul/form\n(potentia intellectiva) to refer to the specifically human\npart of the soul; the rational soul (anima rationalis) refers\nto the whole human soul\u2014which includes the vegetative and\nsensitive forms. Kilwardby adopts this distinction for the most part,\nbut there are passages\u2014especially in E 5 and QLIIS 8\u2014where\nhe uses rational (rationalis) and intellective\n(intellectiva) interchangeably.\n\nOne of the most important passages in which Kilwardby carefully\ndiscusses the human soul is E 5. Here he presents what he takes to be\nthe three more important theories of the human soul, its substantial\nnature, and its potentiae. I focus on the first of these\ntheories, which is the one he most vehemently criticizes, and on the\nthird, which is his own. They can be displayed in the following\nway:\n\n(1) According to the first theory, the human rational soul is a\nsubstance that is simple in its essence, in other words it has no\nparts. It is the same essence that vegetates, senses, and understands.\nThe problem Kilwardby identifies in this theory is that the\nvegetative, sensitive and intellective potentiae are found in\ndifferent kinds of beings: the vegetative is found without the others\nin plants, the sensitive without the intellective in non-rational\nanimals, and the intellective without the other two in spiritual\nbeings. But, if that is the case, how do they come to be one and a\nsame simple essence in humans? The only way to sustain such a thesis\nwould be to argue that these potentiae are equivocally said\nof humans and other beings; but that is manifestly false: if the\nobjects and operations of the powers are the same, the powers and the\npotentiae in which they are rooted must also be the same. For\nexample, in both humans and other living things the operations of the\nvegetative part of the soul are to take nourishment, generate, and\ngrow. Therefore, the vegetative potentiae is the same in all\nliving things and the sensitive is the same in all animals (E 5,\n35\u20136). The problem is that if all three parts of the soul\nconstitute one and the same simple essence, then\n\n(I)\nplants would be endowed with an intellective part of the\n soul.[5]\n\n\nIf that were the case, they would have intellective souls without\nhaving appropriated bodies; so\n\n(P)\na perfection exists without that which it is supposed to perfect\nby existing.\n\n\nThat is, for Kilwardby, manifestly false. A further problem with this\nsimplicity of the essence concerns the coming into being of the soul.\nIf the three potentiae\u2014vegetative, sensitive, and\nintellective\u2014constitute a simple essence, then they must come\ninto being either\n\n(x)\nall in the same way, that is, (x\u2032) by creation or\n(x\u2033) generation; or\n(y)\neach in different ways, that is, by creation in human beings and\nby generation in plants and animals.\n\n\nKilwardby simply rejects (y) because it asserts the existence\nof a naturally generated intellective soul in plants and animals.\n\n\nIf (x\u2032), then the souls of plants and animals are\ncreated out of nothing, which means they cannot be corrupted.\n\nIf (x\u2033), then the human soul is ex traduce\n(hereditary), whence corruptible.\n\n\nBoth lead to absurd consequences and must therefore be dismissed.\nInstead, Kilwardby argues for the double origin of the\npotentiae of the soul, which implies that they must be\nessentially distinct.\n\n(2) According to this theory, the human soul is constituted by three\nsubstantial forms (tribus formis substancialibus) which\ndiffer essentially from one another; of these, two (vegetative and\nsensitive) are the result of the work of nature (opus\nnature)\u2014by means of the potencies of elements and the\noriginal principles with which the matter of transmutable things is\nnaturally endowed\u2014and the intellective form is the result of\ndivine creation. The three forms are present at the same time in the\nhuman embryo only after the intellective soul has been created and\ninfused into the developing being, not before\u2014and this is due to\nthe need for an appropriate level of material organization that\ndisposes the being to receive the intellective soul as its perfection\n(E 5, 44).\n\nThese forms make together one human soul, which is the form of the\nhuman body. Each of these forms can be considered either in respect to\nthe body they vivify and in this sense (as essential determinations)\nnone of them is the form of the others, or as constituting part of a\nsoul that is the animating principle of a certain kind of life, the\nhuman life, and in this sense the intellective part is the form that\ncomplements the others (QLIII2S 63, 268). In the actual constitution\nof all natural things that comprise one natural whole, there are\nseveral dispositions that prepare for and are perfected by the last\nform, which completes the thing (QLIII2S 63, 269). In the case of\nhuman beings, the intellective form is the \u2018completion of human\nlife\u2019 (D43Q 34), that is, that which makes that particular life\nto be a specifically human life. This is the theory Kilwardby takes to\nbe in agreement with philosophical reason and Christian faith and the\none to which he adheres.\n\nKilwardby is clear in showing that his criticism is aimed at the\nconception of the soul as a simple form, as he clearly advocates a\nview of the human being as composite of a plurality of essentially\ndifferent forms. This view is not incompatible with their making one\nsoul, which is the form of a living thing. In the same way as the body\nis a unity even though it is constituted by a plurality of\nparts\u2014foot, hand, blood, bone\u2014each having its own\nform\u2014the human soul also is constituted by a plurality of parts\nand nevertheless is a unity. The parts of the body make one body by\naggregation.\n\nThe human (rational) soul is, according to both Aristotle and\nAugustine (as Kilwardby claims), a substance composed of three\nessentially different parts\u2014the vegetative, sensitive, and\nintellective\u2014just as a definition having three differentiae is\ncomposed (E 5, 43). The unity of the soul is grounded in a hierarchy\nof forms, where some are incomplete and dispositional, while one is\ncompletive and perfective.\n\nEach of these three forms has powers through which it performs the\noperations that are proper to it. Powers are defined by their actions,\nwhich in turn are defined by their objects. The powers of the\nsoul\u2014for example, memory or intellect\u2014are active\npotentialities; once activated by an external agent they bring about\ntheir own actualities by way of their operations\u2014for example,\nunderstanding in the case of the intellect. This conception of powers\nmeans that a human being performs different kinds of operations via\ndifferent forms: a human being understands by means of a power\nbelonging to the intellective form, not to the sensitive or vegetative\nforms (E 5, 43). Essentially different operations are rooted in powers\nbelonging to essentially different forms; for example, perceiving\nrequires bodily organs and understanding does not (QLIIS 8, 29; E 7,\n51). As the result, human beings must be composite of essentially\ndifferent forms.\n\nDespite being composite in substance and powers, the soul is simple in\nexistence in that it is not divisible and exists wholly in every part\nof the body (tota in qualibet parte corporis) (E 6,\n46\u201348). There is, however, one type of unity mentioned in the\nbeginning of this entry that needs to be addressed: the unity of being\nor substantial unity, the unity formed by the body and the soul, which\nis properly a human being.\n\nKilwardby subscribes to the principle according to which two actual\nthings cannot make one thing in actuality. But this principle, he\nclaims, does not apply to the body and soul because neither the\nintellective soul nor the sensitive body\u2014that is, the body\ninformed by the sensitive form\u2014are one complete being. The\nsensitive body is not perfect and needs to be completed by the\nintellective form, and the intellective form is created to be the\nperfection of the sensitive body (E 5, 41).\n\nKilwardby has such a desire to substantiate this unity that he finds\nhimself in an extremely difficult position when considering what\nhappens to the soul and the whole of its potentiae at the\ndeath of the body. He sees no particular problem in arguing for the\nimmortality of the intellective part of the soul, but he hesitates in\nwhat happens to the vegetative and sensitive forms in such a way that\nhe ends up giving two opposite accounts, one aligned with Aristotle,\nthe other with Augustine. On the one hand, according to the former,\nthe vegetative and sensitive forms, operating only through the body,\ncannot remain after death; as they were naturally generated, they were\ncreated by God to be re-united with the resurrected body and the\nimmortal intellective soul at the end of time. On the other hand,\naccording to Augustine, the bond which unites all the\npotentiae of the soul is so strong that it cannot be broken\nwith the separation from the body; the whole soul remains in the\ndisembodied state, and the soul is able in this state to perform acts\nof imagination\u2014not by receiving images of sense objects from\nsense experience but from the power of memory. He indicates no clear\npreference for either account although the Augustinian would seem more\nin tune with his general theory of the soul.\n\nFinally, it is obvious from his account in E 5 that Kilwardby is\nopposing contemporary theories of the soul of the time. In his letter\nto Kilwardby, soon after the Prohibitions, Peter of Conflans inquires\nabout whether he is critical of the theory of the unity of forms\n(positio de unitate formarum) associated with the name of\nThomas Aquinas. In the only place Kilwardby explicitly addresses the\nso-called theory of the unity of forms he describes it as holding that\nthere is only one form that when it supervenes the existing composite\ncorrupts all the existing forms and it performs by itself all the\nactions.\n\nFirst, according to Kilwardby, such a theory claims that there is one\nlast form which is the perfection of the composite; second, that all\nthe other forms informing matter would be corrupted by this perfective\nform, hence, only one form would remain in the whole composite; third,\nthat one and the same form is responsible for all the operations the\nbeing performs. Kilwardby argues against this theory\u2014which\nresembles but is not to be identified with any of the theories\npresented in E 5\u2014with an array of objections, of which the most\nrelevant are:\n\nto have a perfection corrupting rather than perfecting that which\nit is supposed to perfect makes not only useless the work of nature in\nproducing those forms, but it also leaves unaccounted for how the\nparts of the body remain the same if everything is corrupted down to\nprime\n matter[6];\nif the human composite is constituted only by prime matter\n(materia nuda) and the last form (intellective), then how can\nwe account for transubstantiation, incarnation, and resurrection?\nif the same (intellective) form performs all the operations, it\nmeans that the intellective soul operates both through bodily organs\n(as in digesting and perceiving) and without bodily organs (as in\nunderstanding). Moreover, this constitutes, according to Kilwardby, a\nviolation of the Aristotelian principle according to which the\ndiversity of objects implies a diversity of powers which implies a\ndiversity of forms.\n\n\nKilwardby concludes that such a position is incomprehensible and leads\nto major philosophical and theological difficulties; it should\ntherefore be avoided.\n\n",
