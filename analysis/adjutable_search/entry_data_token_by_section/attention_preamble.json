    "main_text": "\n\nAttention is involved in the selective directedness of our mental\nlives. The nature of this selectivity is one of the principal points\nof disagreement between the extant theories of attention. Some of the\nmost influential theories treat the selectivity of attention as\nresulting from limitations in the brain\u2019s capacity to process\nthe complex properties of multiple perceivable stimuli. Other theories\ntake the selectivity of attention to be the result of limitations in\nthe thinking subject\u2019s capacity to consciously entertain\nmultiple trains of thought. A third group attempt to account for\nattention\u2019s selectivity in ways that need not make any reference\nto limitations in capacity. These latter theories relate the\nselectivity of attention to the selectivity required to maintain a\nsingle coherent course of action, to the weighting of sensory\ninformation in accordance with its expected precision, or to\ncompetition between mutually inhibitory streams of processing.\n\nThe instances of attention differ along several dimensions of\nvariation. In some of its instances attention is a perceptual\nphenomenon. In other instances it is a phenomenon related to\naction. In some instances the selectivity of attention is\nvoluntary. In other instances it is driven, quite\nindependently of the subject\u2019s volition, by the high salience of\nattention-grabbing items in the perceptual field. The difficulty of\ngiving a unified theory of attention that applies to attention\u2019s\nvoluntary and involuntary instances, and to its perceptual and\nenactive instances, makes attention a topic of philosophical interest\nin its own right.\n\nAttention is also a topic of philosophical interest because of its\napparent relations to a number of other philosophically puzzling\nphenomena. There are empirical and theoretical considerations\nsuggesting that attention is closely related to\nconsciousness, and there are controversies over whether this\nrelationship is one of necessity, or sufficiency (or both or neither).\nThere are also controversies \u2013 thought to be important to the\nviability of representationism about consciousness \u2013 over the\nways in which the phenomenal character of a conscious experience can\nbe modulated by attention. Different considerations link attention to\ndemonstrative reference, to the development of an\nunderstanding of other minds, and to the exercise of the\nwill. Some work in the tradition of virtue ethics takes\nattention to be morally important, since there are at least\nsome virtues that require one to attend appropriately. Attention has\nalso been given a prominent role in some theories about the epistemic\nsignificance of emotion, and in some discussions of the\nepistemic peculiarities of self-attributed mental states.\n\nThe controversies concerning attention\u2019s relation to these other\nphenomena often include debates about the philosophical significance\nof theories that have been developed through the empirical study of\nattention at the neuropsychological and cognitive levels.\nAttention\u2019s cultural and economic aspects have also become a\npoint of philosophical interest, with some theorists suggesting that\nthe social significance of new media is primarily a consequence of the\nnovel ways in which those media engage and compete for our\nattention.\n",
