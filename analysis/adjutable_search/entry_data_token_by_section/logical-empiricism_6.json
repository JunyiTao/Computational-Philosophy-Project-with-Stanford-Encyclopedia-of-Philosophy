One hears in conversation that it was a sort of rearguard\naction designed to preserve as much as possible of a phenomenalist\nversion of ontological reduction. One reads in print that it can be\nrefuted by the obvious fact that the various sciences have quite\ndistinct theoretical vocabularies (Suppes 1978). Both reactions are\nmisplaced.\n\nIt was the left wing of the Vienna Circle, and above all Otto Neurath,\nthat championed the unity of science. They also promoted physicalism,\nanti-foundationalism, and a generally naturalistic viewpoint. A main\nfocus of their activities from the late 30s was The Encyclopedia\nof Unified Science edited by Neurath in Europe and Carnap and\nCharles Morris in Chicago. A great many philosophers of many different\npersuasions participated in that project. The project may have been\nunified science, but they did not have a completely unified view of\nwhat that project was. Here we will discuss the Neurath and Carnap\nversions of it to see what their central concerns were.\n\nNeurath seems to have had two primary motivations to advance under the\nbanner of the unity of science. First, he was concerned that there be\nno a priori methodological cleavage between the natural and the social\nsciences. On the social scientific side he was concerned that these\nsciences not condone some private, mysterious mode of insight\n(empathy) whose results could not be checked against more ordinary\npublic observation. Such a methodology would be a harbor for\nmetaphysics. On the natural scientific side, he was concerned to point\nout that, for Duhemian and other reasons, the situation is much\nmessier than is sometimes supposed, and so invidious comparisons by\nnatural scientists at the expense of social science were\nunwarranted.\n\nSecond, because Neurath was socially and politically engaged he was\nconcerned that the various sciences be connected in such a way that\nthey could be used together to solve complex human and social\nproblems. For this, considerable overlap of vocabulary was needed, and\nthis he called a \u201cuniversal jargon\u201d.\n\nIn recent years it is sometimes claimed that Neurath meant by the\nunity of science what some contemporary philosophers have defended as\nthe disunity of science. One cannot rule this claim out a priori. But\nthe often substantial differences among the current defenses of\ndisunity make evaluating this claim difficult. It is fair to say,\nhowever, that Neurath was suspicious of grand hypotheses, familiar\nsince the 19th century to derive all of chemistry, biology,\npsychology, and the social sciences (in that order) from a few basic\nprinciples of physics. It is unclear whether this stems from a general\nopposition to system building, since he was eager to develop\ninferential connections among the various sciences. Perhaps this is\nbetter expressed as an opposition to speculative system\nbuilding and to the idea that there is only one way of systematizing\nour science than to systematicity as such.\n\nCarnap\u2019s position on unity is different from Neurath\u2019s,\nbut they overlap. Carnap distinguished the unity of the language of\nscience from the unity of the laws of science. He wanted to defend the\nformer and to say what would be required for the latter. As far as the\nunity of the language of science, Carnap did in the Aufbau\ntry to initiate a program for defining all of scientific concepts on\nthe basis of a very small number of basic concepts, perhaps only one\nbasic concept. That does afford a certain conceptual economy, but it\nis now generally held by Carnap scholars (see especially Friedman 1987\nand Richardson 1998) that ontological reduction and reduction to a\nphenomenalist basis was far from his motive. Carnap explicitly\nacknowledged that another system of definitions, one with a\nphysicalist basis, might also be possible. Instead of ontological\neconomy and a phenomenal basis, Carnap\u2019s project seems to have\nbeen the more Kantian one of indicating how semantic intersubjectivity\nis possible: How can it be that, even though I have only my own\nexperiences and you have only yours, we can nevertheless share a\ncommon body of concepts? The answer is given in terms of shared\ninferential structure and identifying any given concept with a unique\nplace within that shared overall structure. This is a highly holistic\nconception of concepts and it depends on thinking of the body of\nscientific commitments as a whole, as a unity.\n\nThe Aufbau was largely drafted before Carnap joined the\nVienna Circle. Once there and under some influence from Neurath,\nCarnap campaigned more insistently for physicalism and for the unity\nof science. They seemed often to be two sides of the same coin. From\n1933 onward there was a succession of monograph series with\n\u2018Unified Science\u2019 in the title. Until his death in 1945,\nNeurath was in each case the main editor and Carnap either the\nassociate editor or one of the associate editors. The\nInternational Encyclopedia of Unified Science, begun in 1938 is\nundoubtedly the most famous of these. Carnap\u2019s own essay on this\ntopic \u201cLogical Foundations of the Unity of Science\u201d (1938)\nwas printed as part of the very first number in the encyclopedia.\n\nThe dates here are relevant because by the time of this essay Carnap\nhad already decided (Carnap 1936\u201337) that theoretical terms\ncould not in general be given explicit definitions in the observation\nlanguage even though the observation reports were already in a\nphysicalist vocabulary. The partially defined theoretical terms could\nnot be eliminated. This seems to have caused Carnap no consternation\nat all, and it never seems to have occurred to him that there was any\nconflict whatever between this result and the unity of science. This\nis because by this point the elimination of concepts was not the point\nof the exercise; their inferential and evidential integration was.\n\nIn the 1936\u201337 article, \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d\nCarnap called the partial definitions themselves \u201creduction\nsentences\u201d and the system of definitions of theoretical terms,\nboth partial and complete, as a reduction of the theoretical terms to\nthe observational basis. Plainly he means by the word\n\u2018reduction\u2019 something other than what we currently mean,\nnot that there is anything univocal about current uses of the word. By\n\u2018reduction\u2019 of vocabulary A to vocabulary\nB Carnap means the specification of the inferential relations\nthat would allow us to say what sentences or combinations of sentences\nin A would count as evidence for sentences in B.\n\nThis is also the key to what Carnap means by the unity of the language\nof science. The language of science is unified, no matter how\ndifferent and exotic its various technical vocabularies may be, when\neach of its terms is reduced to (can be tested in) a common public\nobservation vocabulary. The call for the unity of the language of\nscience, then, amounts to no more than the demand that the various\nclaims of the separate sciences should be publicly testable in a\ncommon observation language. Controversies will of course arise as to\nwhat the observational vocabulary should be and what are the\nacceptable forms of linkage. Carnap\u2019s demand for unity in the\nlanguage of science abstracts from those controversies to concentrate\non the goal of public testability. That does not seem to be an\nunreasonable demand.\n\nThe unity of the language of science so far discussed is quite a\ndifferent issue from the unity of the laws of science. And\nCarnap\u2019s attitudes toward them are quite different. The latter\nissue concerns the extent to which the laws of one special science can\nbe inferred from those of another. Carnap tries to articulate what\nwould be involved in such a unification, but he nowhere says that such\na unity is either possible or mandatory. Finding any sort of\ninferential connections among sets of laws would be welcome of course.\nBut the question of how much unity there is, if any, among the various\nsciences is an empirical question that philosophers are ill equipped\nto answer. Philosophers should not make pronouncements, especially in\nadvance of having putative laws in hand, either that scientific laws\nare unified or that they are not. A certain modest deference to the\nempirical facts that philosophers generally do not have, again, does\nnot seem unreasonable.\n\nTaking unity as a working hypothesis, as some philosophers have done,\namounts to looking for inferential and nomological\nconnections among various sets of laws, but not to the assertion that\nsuch connection will be found. Even if we accept the idea that such\nconnections would be welcome if found, the question of whether one\nshould spend significant effort in looking for them is not thereby\nanswered. That would be a difficult and delicate practical question of\nhow to apportion one\u2019s research effort that for the purposes of\nthis essay we must set aside.\n",
