    "main_text": "His life\n1. His life\n\n\nCrescas was born in Barcelona to a revered family of merchants and\nrabbis around 1340. In the first period of his life (i.e. before 1391)\nCrescas lived in Aragon during a relatively quiet period for the Jews.\nHe learned in the yeshiva (Jewish academy) of the town, which was\nheaded by Rabbi Nissim of Gerondi. In this yeshiva, Crescas learned not\nonly the traditional Jewish corpus of Bible, Talmud, and the other\nparts of the Oral Law, but also Kabbala, science, and philosophy,\nincluding the Jewish philosophy of Maimonides and his followers as well\nas classical philosophy and perhaps even Christian\n scholastics.[2]\n\n\nWe know that by the year 1370 Crescas was a proficient young\nscholar, a Talmudist, and a judge in Barcelona. Following the death of\nRabbi Nissim of Gerondi, Crescas and his friend Rabbi Isaac bar Sheshet\n(Ribash) became the main Jewish authorities of Aragon, and possibly of\nall Spain. People from all over the occidental Jewish World would ask\nthem legalist questions (Harvey 2010, 20). In 1387, Pierre the Fourth\nof Aragon died, and his son Juan became the new king. This king and his\nFrench queen, Violant de Bar, loved culture, and their palace in\nSaragossa became the center of culture and science. In this palace\nCrescas could have met Bernard Matege, a humanist employed as the court\nscribe. Through him, Crescas may have become aware of the humanist\nmovement in Italy, and indeed Warren Harvey has speculated that there\nwas a considerable amount of mutual influence between the\ntwo\n intellectuals.[3]\nIn 1389, Crescas\nleft Barcelona and became the rabbi of the capital of the crown of\nAragon: Saragossa. A year later the King and Queen appointed him as the\nhighest judge of all the Jews in the crown, and bestowed him with a\nhigh degree of authority over the Jewish community.\n\n\nThe pogroms of 1391 had a decisive influence on the life of Crescas\nand on the entire Spanish Jewish\n community.[4]\nIn those pogroms thousands of Jews perished and\naround a hundred fifty thousand converted to Christianity. The pogroms\nbegan in Castilla, but the rioters crossed the Aragon border. Almost\nhalf of the Jews of Spain after 1391 became Christian. Aragon\u2019s\nmajor Jewish communities in Barcelona, Valencia and Gerona disappeared.\nA son of Crescas died in Barcelona, and the yeshiva of Barcelona, one\nof the most important in the Middle Ages, disappeared. In the Crown of\nAragon, the King and Queen tried to save the Jews and to prevent the\npogrom, but they were successful only in Aragon, whereas the\ncommunities of Valencia, Catalonia and the Baleares Island were\ndestroyed. Amongst the reasons for the success of the pogrom in\nCastilla was the fact that the king was a child at the time and the\nCastilian government was inefficient.\n\n\nAfter these events, Crescas became the leader of the Spanish\ncommunity in its fight to survive. With the help of the King and Queen\nof Aragon, he tried to restore the Jewish community of Barcelona\n(without success). He helped converso Jews who wanted to come\nback to Judaism to leave Spain for Muslim countries in North Africa. He\nultimately wanted to find a safer place for the Spanish Jews, possibly\nin the Kingdom of Navarre.\n\n\nThe turning point of 1391 influenced the literary activity of\nCrescas. He probably wrote fewer philosophical works (and certainly\nfewer Talmudic and legal works), while most likely writing more\npolemical books against Christianity than he had planned to before the\npogrom.\n\n\nUntil his death late in 1410 or in January of 1411, Crescas remained\nthe spiritual head of Spanish Jewry. As a part of his role, he tried to\nbuild a new generation of Jewish leaders. After the pogrom, Crescas\ncontinued to teach Torah, Talmud, science, and philosophy. His star\npupil in philosophy was Rabbi Josef Albo, while his star pupil in\nTalmudic studies and law was Rabbi Josef Ibn Haviva. Crescas also\ninfluenced the polemical works of Profiat Duran (Efodi). Crescas\nrequested the translation from Arabic to Hebrew of the work of Abraham\nIbn-Dahoud Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah by Solomon ben Levi. The second\ntranslation of this work under the title Ha-Emunah\nNissa\u2019ah by Samuel ibn Motot is probably based on the first\none. The original Arabic text is now lost, so it is likely thanks to\nCrescas that this important philosophical work has survived.\n",
