    "main_text": "The Cratylus and Its Personae\u2014a First Overview\n1. The Cratylus and Its Personae\u2014a First Overview\n\nWho are the protagonists of the Cratylus? All of them are\nhistorical figures\u2014citizens of fifth and fourth century Athens,\nto be precise. Hermogenes was a (possibly illegitimate) offspring of a\nvery wealthy and powerful Athenian dynasty (on which see Nails 2002:\n68\u201374), but did apparently not inherit anything from his family\n(391c). Always in financial troubles (384c), he was a committed member\nof the circle around Socrates; as the Phaedo (59b) indicates,\nhe was even present at Socrates\u2019 death. Cratylus was a\nphilosopher who, according to Aristotle\u2019s report, taught the\nyoung Plato (Metaphysics 987a29\u2013b7). He is known as a\nradical advocate of the Heraclitean claim that everything is in flux;\napparently, he even stopped speaking at some point because he took\nspeaking to be senseless in a world of flux (Metaphysics\n1010a7\u201315). In the Cratylus, he appears to be at an\nearly stage of his philosophical career, just beginning to appropriate\nHeraclitean positions (440d\u2013e; cf. Kirk 1951: 236). About\nSocrates, the third protagonist, there is so much to say that\ninterested readers should consult the entry on\n Socrates.\n One well-known fact appears to be particularly relevant in the\npresent context, however: Socrates was the other teacher of the young\nPlato\u2014which means that the Cratylus is an encounter\nbetween the two philosophers who influenced Plato most directly.\n\nThe Cratylus begins when Socrates joins the on-going debate\nbetween Cratylus and Hermogenes as an arbiter. He first invites\nHermogenes to state his conventionalist view of the correctness of\nnames (383a\u2013386e)\u2014and refutes him by presenting an\nargument for the conclusion that names are indeed subject to a\nstandard of natural correctness (386e\u2013390e). Asked to expand on\nthis standard (391a), Socrates conjectures that a correct name needs\nto be a portmanteau: Like the name \u201cshepherd\u201d (from\n\u201csheep\u201d and \u201cherder\u201d), it needs to be composed\nof other names in a way that ensures that it encapsulates a\ndescription of what its referents are (390e\u2013394e). He\nillustrates this conjecture by uncovering the descriptive content of\nmany Greek names in a famous\u2014and famously\nextensive\u2014etymological survey (394e\u2013421c). The survey ends\nabruptly when Socrates realizes that he cannot account for the\ncorrectness of all names in this way; there must, after all, be some\nnames that are not composed of other names. Socrates\u2019 hypothesis\nis that these names are correct because they are imitations of what\ntheir referents are (421c\u2013427d). He thus arrives at a two-tiered\nnaturalist theory of the correctness of names. Cratylus, who takes\nover from Hermogenes as Socrates\u2019 interlocutor, endorses this\ntheory enthusiastically. But in a surprising twist, Socrates turns\nagainst his own brainchild and compels Cratylus to admit that\nconvention is a factor that contributes to the correctness of names\n(427d\u2013435d). He never spells out, however, what exactly the\ncontribution of convention is. He rather goes on to refute\nCratylus\u2019 further claim that unearthing the descriptive content\nof names yields unshakable evidence for the belief that reality is in\na state of flux (435d\u2013439c)\u2014and ends his investigation by\nsketching four arguments for the existence of unchangeable forms\n(439c\u2013440e).\n",
