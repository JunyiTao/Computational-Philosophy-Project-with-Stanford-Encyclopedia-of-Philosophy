    "main_text": "The Rights and Duties of Gamete Donors || Offspring Limits\n1.5 Offspring Limits\n\nIn addition to obligations that focus on the wellbeing of potential\noffspring and the competence of intending parents, another question is\nwhether there ought to be limits on the number of offspring that can\nbe created from a single gamete provider. This question is most\nsignificant in sperm provision because of the relative ease of\ncreating large numbers of children from the gametes provided by a\nsingle individual. Three major justifications have been offered for\noffspring limits: the risk of accidental consanguineous relationships,\nthe likelihood of convoluted social relationships with kin, and\ngeneral social discomfort with large offspring numbers (Wright 2016).\nWhile the last might not be a plausible justification on its own, it\nis worth mentioning because in practice such concerns have had an\ninfluential role on imposed offspring limits (Deech 1998; Warnock\nReport 1984).\n\nLimiting offspring numbers in order to reduce the likelihood of\naccidental consanguineous relationships between offspring of the same\ndonor was initially proposed by individuals concerned about possible\nrisks of congenital disease (Curie-Cohen 1980). Recent work has\nattempted to quantify these risks (De Boer et al. 1995; Wang et al.\n2007). While the increased risk of congenital disease resulting from\nunintentional consanguinity is dependent on the size of the population\nserved by a sperm bank, the risk is lower than might be initially\nthought. For instance, Dutch models suggest that an offspring limit of\nup to 25 would not result in any significant increased risk, given\ntheir particular demographic makeup (De Boer et al. 1995). However,\nthere is also the risk of psychological harm for individuals that\ndiscover they have unwittingly entered into a consanguineous\nrelationship, given the associated social taboos (Wright 2016).\nFurthermore, there may be legal complications if an accidental\nconsanguineous marriage is discovered after the fact (Cahn 2009a). One\nway to mitigate these risks without imposing offspring limits would be\nto increase openness in gamete provision, including actively informing\nindividuals about the identity of their genetic siblings. However,\neven in the absence of such measures there is little agreement about\nhow the risks associated with consanguinity should be translated into\noffspring limits, especially given the broad reproductive freedom\nindividuals are generally afforded (Wright 2016; HFEA 2011).\n\nThe main worry in relation to social relationships with kin is that\ninitiating and maintaining relationships with progenitors and/or\ngenetic siblings is made much more challenging if there are large\nnumbers to accommodate. The extent to which this justifies offspring\nlimits will depend on the importance placed on such relationships and,\nas noted previously, there is much disagreement about this.\nFurthermore, some empirical research into kin relationships following\ngamete provision has found that having large numbers of genetic\nsiblings is not necessarily an impediment to the formation of\nmeaningful relationships (Freeman, Jadva, & Slutsky 2016).\n",
