    "main_text": "Dilthey\u2019s Life and Thought || The Religious Background of Dilthey\u2019s Philosophy\n1.2 The Religious Background of Dilthey\u2019s Philosophy\n\nDilthey followed family tradition by starting his university studies\nat Heidelberg in theology. There he was also introduced to the\nphilosophical systems of the idealists by Kuno Fischer. Because\nFischer was accused of being a pantheist, his right to teach was\nwithdrawn in 1853. Dilthey then moved to the University of Berlin,\nwhere he came under the influence of two of Friedrich\nSchleiermacher\u2019s students, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg and\nAugust Boeckh. Increasingly, Schleiermacher became the focus of\nDilthey\u2019s interests. In 1859 he was asked to complete the\nediting of Schleiermacher\u2019s letters. That year the\nSchleiermacher Society also organized an essay competition.\nDilthey\u2019s submission entitled \u201cSchleiermacher\u2019s\nHermeneutical System in Relation to Earlier Protestant\nHermeneutics\u201d (1860, SW.IV, 33\u2013227), was awarded the first\nprize and led to a second commission, namely, to write\nSchleiermacher\u2019s biography. The first volume of this biography\nwas published in 1870. It places Schleiermacher not only in his\ntheological setting but also in the context of the literary and\nphilosophical movements astir in Berlin from 1796 to 1807. The work\ndisplays Dilthey\u2019s own expanding interests in aesthetical and\nphilosophical issues. He also wrote his dissertation on\nSchleiermacher\u2019s ethics.\n\nAs a theology student, Dilthey had begun a study of many early\nformulations of the Christian worldview, which though never completed,\ncontinued to influence his subsequent writings. In 1860 Dilthey writes\nthat \n\n\nit is my calling to apprehend the innermost nature of religious life\nin history and to bring this to the attention of our times which are\nmoved exclusively by matters of state and science. (JD, 140) \n\n\nThis means looking for religiosity not so much in its institutional\npractices and its theological doctrines as in the recesses of human\nexperience. In a similar vein, he asserts that it is necessary to\nrecover the \u201creligious-philosophical worldview that is buried\nunder the ruins of our theology and philosophy\u201d (JD, 140).\n\nDilthey conceives religious experience as an extension of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s feeling of absolute dependence. It is a total\nexperience that interweaves a feeling of dependence with an awareness\nof a capacity to uplift ourselves. Religious experience is regarded as\nan enduring background and accompaniment of human intellectual life.\nReligion has manifested itself in many forms such as mythical\nrepresentations, mystical ideas of revelation and human redemption,\ntheological doctrines, and metaphysical theories. Because of its\nemphasis on meteorological events (1883/ SW I, 450), Dilthey saw myth\nas a primitive scientific theory that compromised the genuine\nreligiosity of mystical feelings.\n\nLater as he reflected on the nature of worldviews, Dilthey would\noccasionally return to the problem of religion. What distinguishes the\nreligious worldview from artistic and philosophical worldviews is that\nit relates the visible to what is invisible, life to our awareness of\ndeath. In a striking late passage, Dilthey writes that when life is\nexperienced religiously and \n\n\naccording to its true nature\u2014full of hardships and a singular\nblend of suffering and happiness throughout\u2014<we are>\npointed to something strange and unfamiliar, as if it were coming from\ninvisible sources, something <pressing in> on life from outside,\nyet coming from its own depths. (ca. 1910/SW.III, 285)\n\n\nThe same non-transcendent perspective on religion is to be found in\nDilthey\u2019s last essay, written during the final days of his life\nin 1911 while he was on vacation in the Dolomites. This essay on\n\u201cThe Problem of Religion\u201d points to the fact that the\nEnlightenment has made it increasingly difficult to acknowledge the\nmystical aspects of religious experience. Enlightenment thinkers\nregarded mystical experience as irrational. But according to Dilthey,\nSchleiermacher was able to avoid this charge of irrationalism by\nrelating core aspects of religious experience to the insights of\ntranscendental philosophy. Instead of interpreting the mystical\nfeeling of communion as an esoteric union with a transcendent God,\nSchleiermacher explicates it as a general awareness that is attuned to\nthe invisible coherence of things down here (1911/SW.VI,304\u201305).\nHe gives a transcendental reading of what is intuited and felt in the\nreligious mood by transforming it into a creative life-principle.\nWhereas traditionally mysticism tended to devalue our life in this\nworld, Schleiermacher\u2019s mysticism is seen as affirming it.\n",
