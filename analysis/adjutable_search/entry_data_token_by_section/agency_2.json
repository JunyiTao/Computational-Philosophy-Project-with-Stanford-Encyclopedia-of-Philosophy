    "main_text": "Conceptions, theories, and kinds of agency || Agency as intentional action\n2.1 Agency as intentional action\nThe standard conception of action provides us with a conception of\nagency. According to this view, a being has the capacity to exercise agency just\nin case it has the capacity to act intentionally, and the exercise of\nagency consists in the performance of intentional actions and, in many\ncases, in the performance of unintentional actions (that derive from\nthe performance of intentional actions; see\nsection 2). Call this the standard conception of agency. The standard theory of action provides us with a theory of agency, according to which a being\nhas the capacity to act intentionally just in case it has the right\nfunctional organization: just in case the instantiation of certain\nmental states and events (such as desires, beliefs, and intentions)\nwould cause the right events (such as certain movements) in the right\nway. According to this standard theory of agency, the exercise of\nagency consists in the instantiation of the right causal relations\nbetween agent-involving states and events. (Proponents include\nDavidson 1963, 1971; Goldman 1970; Brand 1984; Bratman 1987; Dretske\n1988; Bishop 1989; Mele 1992, 2003; En\u00e7 2003.)\nThe most serious problem for this standard theory has been the\nproblem of deviant causal chains. Further, some have argued that this\nview altogether fails to capture agency, because it reduces actions to\nmere happenings. We will turn to those issues in\nsection 3. Recently, it has been argued that reasons for actions cannot be the\ncauses of actions, because reasons are facts or states of affairs, not\nmental states or events (Dancy 2000; Alvarez 2010). But the standard\ntheory is not committed to the claim that reasons are identical with\nmental entities. It is, in particular, compatible with the view that\nreasons are the things that are represented by the contents of the\nrelevant mental states and events (see Scanlon 1998: 56\u201364; Mele\n2003: 82\u201384; Setiya 2007: 28\u201331).\n",
