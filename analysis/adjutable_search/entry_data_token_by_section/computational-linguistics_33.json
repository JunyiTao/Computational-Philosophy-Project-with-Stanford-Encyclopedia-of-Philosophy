    "main_text": "Applications || Natural language user interfaces\n10.7 Natural language user interfaces\n\nThe topic of NL user interfaces subsumes a considerable variety of\nNL applications, ranging from text-based systems minimally dependent on\nunderstanding to systems with significant comprehension and inference\ncapabilities in text- or speech-based interactions. The following\nsubsections briefly survey a range of traditional and current\napplications areas.\n\nText-based question answering\nText-based QA is practical to the extent that the types of\nquestions being asked can be expected to have ready-made answers\ntucked away somewhere in the text corpora being accessed by the QA\nsystem. This has become much more feasible in this age of burgeoning\ninternet content than a few decades ago, though questions still need\nto be straightforward, factual ones (e.g., \n\u201cWho killed President Lincoln?\u201d) rather than ones requiring inference (e.g., \n\u201cIn what century did Catherine the Great live?\u201d, let alone\n\n\u201cApproximately how many 8-foot 2-by-4s do I need to build a\n4-foot high, 15-foot long picket fence?\u201d).\nText-based QA begins with question classification (e.g., yes-no\nquestions, who-questions, what-questions, when-questions, etc.),\nfollowed by information retrieval for the identified type of question,\nfollowed by narrowing of the search to paragraphs and finally sentences\nthat may contain the answer to the question. The successive narrowing\ntypically employs word and other feature matching, and ultimately\ndependency and role matching, and perhaps limited textual inference to\nverify answer candidates. Textual inference may, for instance, use\nWordNet hypernym knowledge to try to establish that a given candidate\nanswer sentence supports the truth of the declarative version of the\nquestion. Since the chosen sentence(s) may contain irrelevant material\nand anaphors, it remains to extract the relevant material (which may\nalso include supporting context) and generate a well-formed,\nappropriate answer. Many early text-based QA systems up to 1976 are\ndiscussed in Bourne & Hahn 2003. Later surveys (e.g., Maybury\n2004) have tended to include the full spectrum of QA methods, but TREC\nconference proceedings \n(https://trec.nist.gov/) \nfeature numerous papers\non implemented systems for text-based QA.\nIn open-domain QA, many questions are concerned with properties of\nnamed entities, such as birth date, birth place, occupation, and other\npersonal attributes of well-known present and historical individuals,\nlocations, ownership, and products of various companies, facts about\nconsumer products, geographical facts, and so on. For answering such\nquestions, it makes sense to pre-assemble the relevant factoids into a\nlarge knowledge base, using knowledge acquisition methods like those in\nsection 8. Examples of systems containing an abundance of factoids\nabout named entities are several developed at the University of\nWashington, storing factoids as text fragments, and various\nsystems that map harvested factoids into RDF\n(Resource Description Framework) triples\n (see references in Other Internet Resources). Some\nof these systems obtain their knowledge not only from open information\nextraction and targeted relation extraction, but also from such sources\nas Wikipedia \u201cinfoboxes\u201d and (controlled) crowdsourcing. Here we are\nalso stretching the notion of question answering, since several of the\nmentioned systems require the use of key words or query patterns for\nretrieval of factoids.\nFrom a general user perspective, it is unclear how much added\nbenefit can be derived from such constructed KBs, given the remarkable\nability of Google and other search engines to provide rapid answers\neven to such questions as \u201cWhich European countries are\nlandlocked?\u201d (typed without quotes\u2014with quotes, Google\nfinds the top answer using True Knowledge), or \u201cHow many Supreme\nCourt justices did Kennedy appoint?\u201d Nonetheless, both Google\nand Microsoft have recently launched vast \u201cknowledge\ngraphs\u201d featuring thousands of relations among hundreds of\nmillions of entities. The purpose is to provide direct answers (rather\nthen merely retrieved web page snippets) to query terms and natural\nlanguage questions, and to make inferences about the likely intent of\nusers, such as purchasing some type of item or service.\n\nDatabase front-ends\n\nNatural-language front ends for databases have long been considered an\nattractive application of NLP technology, beginning with such systems\nas LUNAR (Woods et al.  1972) and REL (Thompson et al.  1969; Thompson\n& Thompson 1975). The attractiveness lies in the fact that\nretrieval and manipulation of information from a relational (or other\nuniformly structured) database can be assumed to be handled by an\nexisting db query language and process. This feature sharply limits\nthe kinds of natural language questions to be expected from a user,\nsuch as questions aimed at retrieving objects or tuples of objects\nsatisfying given relational constraints, or providing summary or\nextremal properties (longest rivers, lowest costs, and the like) about\nthem. It also greatly simplifies the interpretive process and\nquestion-answering, since the target logical forms\u2014formal db\nqueries\u2014have a known, precise syntax and are executed\nautomatically by the db management system, leaving only the work of\ndisplaying the computed results in some appropriate linguistic,\ntabular or graphical form.\nNumerous systems have been built since then, aimed at applications\nsuch as navy data on ships and their deployment\n(Ladder: Hendrix et al.  1978),\nland-use planning (Damerau 1981), geographic QA\n(Chat-80: Pereira & Warren 1982),\nretrieval of company records and product records for insurance\ncompanies, oil companies, manufacturers, retailers, banks,\netc. (Intellect: Harris 1984), compilation\nof statistical data concerning customers, services,\nassets, etc., of a company (Cercone et al. 1993), and\nmany more (e.g., see Androutsopoulos & Ritchie 2000). However, the\ncommercial impact of such systems has remained scant, because they\nhave generally lacked the reliability and some of the functionalities\nof traditional db access.\nInferential (knowledge-based) question answering\nWe have noted certain limited inferential capabilities in text-based\nQA systems and NL front ends for databases, such as the ability to\nconfirm entailment relations between candidate answers and questions,\nusing simple sorts of semantic relations among the terms involved, and\nthe ability to sort or categorize data sets from databases and compute\naverages or even create statistical charts.\nHowever, such limited, specialized inference methods fall far short\nof the kind of general reasoning based on symbolic knowledge that has\nlong been the goal in AI question answering. One of the earliest\nefforts to create a truly inferential QA system was the ENGLAW project\nof L. Stephen Coles (Coles 1972). ENGLAW was intended as a prototype\nof a kind of system that might be used by scientists and engineers to\nobtain information about physical laws. It featured a KB of axioms (in\nfirst-order logic) for 128 important physical laws, manually coded\nwith the aid of a reference text. Questions (such as \u201cIn the\nPeltier Effect, does the heat developed depend on the direction of the\nelectric current?\u201d) were rendered into logic via a\ntransformational grammar parser, and productions (aided by various\nLisp functions) that map phrase patterns to logical expressions. The\nsystem was not developed to the point of practical usefulness, but its\nintegration of reasoning and NLP technologies and its methods of\nselectively retrieving axioms for inferential QA were noteworthy\ncontributions.\nAn example of a later larger-scale system aimed at practical goals\nwas BBN's JANUS system (Ayuso et al.\n1990). This was intended for naval\nbattle management applications, and could answer questions about the\nlocations, readiness, speed and other attributes of ships, allowing for\nchange with the passage of time. It mapped English queries to a very\nexpressive initial representation language with an \u201cintension\u201d operator\nto relate formulas to times and possible worlds, and this was in turn\nmapped into the NIKL description logic, which proved adequate for the\nmajority of inferences needed for the targeted kinds of QA.\nJumping forward in time, we take note of the web-based\nWolfram|Alpha (or WolframAlpha) answer engine, developed by Wolfram\nResearch and consisting of 15 million lines of Mathematica code\ngrounded in curated data bases, models, and algorithms for thousands\nof different domains. (Mathematica is a mathematically oriented\nhigh-level programming language developed by the British scientist\nStephen Wolfram.) The system is tilted primarily towards quantitative\nquestions (e.g., \u201cWhat is the GDP of France?\u201d, or\n\u201cWhat is the surface area of the Moon?\u201d) and often\nprovides charts and graphics along with more direct answers. The\ninterpretation of English queries into functions applied to various\nknown objects is accomplished with the pattern matching and symbol\nmanipulation capabilities of Mathematica.  However, the comprehension\nof English is not particularly robust at the time of writing. For\nexample \u201cHow old was Lincoln when he died?\u201d, \u201cAt\nwhat age did Lincoln die?\u201d and other variants were not\nunderstood, though in many cases of misunderstanding, Wolfram|Alpha\ndisplays enough retrieved information to allow inference of an\nanswer. A related shortcoming is that Wolfram|Alpha's quantitative\nskills are not supplemented with significant qualitative reasoning\nskills. For example, \u201cWas Socrates a man?\u201d (again, at the\ntime of writing) prompts display of summary information about\nSocrates, including an image, but no direct answer to the\nquestion. Still, Wolfram|Alpha's quantitative abilities are not only\ninteresting in stand-alone mode, but also useful as augmentations of\nsearch engines (such as Microsoft Bing) and of voice-based personal\nassistants such as Apple's Siri (see below).\nAnother QA system enjoying wide recognition because of its\ntelevised victory in the Jeopardy! quiz show is IBM's\n\u201cWatson\u201d (Ferrucci 2012; Ferrucci et al. 2010; Baker\n2011). Like Wolfram|Alpha, this is in a sense a brute force program,\nconsisting of about a million lines of code in Java, C++, Prolog and\nother languages, created by a core team of 20 researchers and software\nengineers over the course of three years. The program runs 3000\nprocesses in parallel on ninety IBM Power 750 servers, and has access\nto 200 million pages of content from sources such as Wordnet,\nWikipedia (and its structured derivatives YAGO and DBpedia), thesauri,\nnewswire articles, and literary texts, amounting to several terabytes\nof human knowledge. (This translates into roughly 1010\nclausal chunks\u2014a number likely to be around 2 orders of\nmagnitude greater than the number of basic facts over which any one\nhuman being disposes.)\nRather than relying on any single method of linguistic or semantic\nanalysis, or method of judging relevance of retrieved passages and\ntextual \u201cnuggets\u201d therein, Watson applies multiple methods to the\nquestions and candidate answers, including methods of question\nclassification, focal entity detection, parsing, chunking, lexical\nanalysis, logical form computation, referent determination, relation\ndetection, temporal analysis, and special methods for question-answer\npairs involving puns, anagrams, and other twists common in Jeopardy!.\nDifferent question analyses are used separately to retrieve relevant\ndocuments, and to derive, analyze and score potential answers from\npassages and sentences in those documents. In general, numerous\ncandidate answers to a question are produced, and their analyses\nprovide hundreds of features whose weights for obtaining ranked answers\nwith corresponding confidence levels are learned by ML methods applied\nto a corpus of past Jeopardy! questions and answers (or officially,\nanswers and questions, according to the peculiar conceit of the\nJeopardy! protocol). Watson's wagers are based on the confidence levels\nof its potential answers and a complex regression model.\nHow well does Watson fit under our heading of inferential,\nknowledge-based QA? Does it actually understand the questions\nand the answers it produces? Despite its impressive performance\nagainst Jeopardy! champions, Watson reasons, and understands English\nin only very restricted senses. The program exploits the fact that the\ntarget of a Jeopardy! question is usually a named entity, such\nas Jimmy Carter, Islamabad, or Black Hole of\nCalcutta, though other types of phrases are occasionally\ntargeted. Watson is likely to find multiple sentences that mention a\nparticular entity of the desired type, and whose syntactic and\nsemantic features are close to the features of the question, thereby\nmaking the named entity a plausible answer without real understanding\nof the question. For example, a \u201crecent history\u201d question\nasking for the president under whom the US gave full recognition to\nCommunist China (Ferrucci 2012) might well zero in on such sentences\nas\n\nAlthough\nhe was the president who restored full diplomatic\nrelations with China in 1978, Jimmy Carter has never visited that country\n\u2026\n(New York Times, June 27, 1981)\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nExchanges\nbetween the two countries' nuclear scientists had begun\nsoon after President Jimmy Carter officially recognized China in 1978.\n(New York Times, Feb. 2, 2001)\n\n\nWhile the links between such sentences and the correct answer are\nindirect (e.g., dependent on resolving he and who to\nJimmy Carter, and associating restored diplomatic\nrelations with recognized, and Communist China\nwith China), correct analysis of those links is not a\nrequirement for success\u2014it is sufficient for the cluster of\nsentences favoring the answer Jimmy Carter (in virtue of their word\nand phrasal content and numerous other features) to provide a larger\nnet weight to that answer than any competing clusters. This type of\nstatistical evidence combination based on stored texts seems unlikely\nto provide a path to the kind of understanding that even first-graders\nbetray in answering simple commonsense questions, such as \u201cHow\ndo people keep from getting wet when it rains?\u201d, or \u201cIf\nyou eat a cookie, what happens to the cookie?\u201d At the same time,\nvast data banks utilized in the manner of Watson can make up for\ninferential weakness in various applications, and IBM is actively\nredeveloping Watson as a resource for physicians, one that should be\nable to provide diagnostic and treatment possibilities that even\nspecialists may not have at their fingertips. In sum, however, the\ngoal of open-domain QA based on genuine understanding and\nknowledge-based reasoning remains largely unrealized.\n\nVoice-based web services and assistants\n\nVoice-based services, especially on mobile devices, are a rapidly\nexpanding applications area. Services range from organizers (for\ngrocery lists, meeting schedules, reminders, contact lists, etc.), to\nin-car \u201cinfotainment\u201d (routing, traffic conditions, hazard warnings,\niTunes selection, finding nearby restaurants and other venues, etc.),\nto enabling use of other miscellaneous apps such as email dictation,\ndialing contacts, financial transactions, reservations and placement of\norders, Wikipedia access, help-desk services, health advising, and\ngeneral question answering. Some of these services (such as\ndialing and iTunes selection) fall into the category of hands-free\ncontrols, and such controls are becoming increasingly important in\ntransport (including driverless or pilotless vehicles), logistics\n(deployment of resources), and manufacturing. Also chatbot\ntechnology and companionable dialogue agents (as discussed in \nsection 10.5) \nare serving as general backends to more specific voice-based\nservices.\nThe key technology in these services is of course speech\nrecognition, whose accuracy and adaptability has been gradually\nincreasing.  The least expensive, narrowly targeted systems\n(e.g., simple organizers) exploit strong expectations about user\ninputs to recognize, interpret and respond to those inputs; as such\nthey resemble menu-driven systems. More versatile systems, such as car\ntalkers that can handle routing, musical requests, searches for\nvenues, etc., rely on more advanced dialogue management\ncapabilities. These allow for topic switches and potentially for the\nattentional state of the user (e.g., delaying answering a driver's\nquestion if the driver needs to attend to a turn). The greatest\ncurrent \u201cbuzz\u201d surrounds advanced voice-based assistants, notably\niPhone's Siri (followed by Android's Iris, True Knowledge's Evi,\nGoogle Now, and others). While previous voice control and dictation\nsystems, like Android's Vlingo, featured many of the same\nfunctionalities, Siri adds personality and improved dialogue handling\nand service integration\u2014users feel that they are interacting\nwith a lively synthetic character rather than an app. Besides Nuance\nSR technology, Siri incorporates complex techniques that were to some\nextent pushed forward by the Calo (Cognitive Assistant\nthat Learns and Organizes) project carried out by SRI International\nand multiple universities from 2003\u20132008 (Ambite et al. 2006;\nCALO [see Other Internet Resources]). \nThese techniques include aspects of NLU, ML, goal-directed and\nuncertain inference, ontologies, planning, and service delegation. But\nwhile delegation to web services, including Wolfram|Alpha QA, or\nchatbot technology provides considerable robustness, and there is\nsignificant reasoning about schedules, purchasing and other targeted\nservices, general understanding is still very shallow, as users soon\ndiscover. Anecdotal examples of serious misunderstandings are\n\u201cCall me an ambulance\u201d eliciting the response \u201cFrom\nnow on I will call you \u2018an ambulance\u2019\u201d. However, the\nstrong interest and demand in the user community generated by these\nearly (somewhat) intelligent, quite versatile assistants is likely to\nintensify and accelerate research towards ever more life-like virtual\nagents, with ever more understanding and common sense.\n",
