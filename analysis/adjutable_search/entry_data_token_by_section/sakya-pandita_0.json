    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n Sapa\u1e47[1]\n was the fourth of the \u201cFive Great Throneholders\u201d of Sakya\n(Tib. sa-skya), the monastery that was the seat of the noble\nKh\u00f6n clan and the institutional hub for one of the main schools\nof Tibetan Buddhism. The first of the five was Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\ngrandfather, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, and the second and third were his\nuncles Sonam Tsemo and Drakpa Gyeltsen. His uncles were both celibate\nmonks, so the royal line fell naturally to him, the eldest nephew.\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s biographies contain hagiographical fancy that\nassimilates his early life to that of the Buddha or other great\nintellects: His mother dreamed of a crowned N\u0101ga king coming to\nher when Sapa\u1e47 entered her womb; as an infant he spoke and wrote\nSanskrit; as a child he was gentle and compassionate, knew many topics\nwithout having studied them, and imbibed the dharma without effort. As\nhe grew (and we enter more realistic history), he received teachings\nfrom many great masters both within his family and abroad, and he\ncontinued to distinguish himself for his preternaturally quick\nmastery, sharp discernment, and elegant instruction. In dreams, he had\nvisions confirming his abilities at understanding the works of\nVasubandhu and Dign\u0101ga.\n\nA major turning point in his life came when the Kashmiri scholar\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012bbhadra arrived in Tibet with an entourage\nof pa\u1e47\u1e0ditas from India and Nepal. Sapa\u1e47\nwent to meet him and established a crucial relationship with these\nscholars. He was able to hire one of the\npa\u1e47\u1e0ditas, Sugata\u015br\u012b, as a personal\ntutor for three years, and then return to study with\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012b for another five years. It was with these\nscholars that Sapa\u1e47 came to master the linguistic\nsciences\u2014Sanskrit grammar, poetics, and metrics\u2014but also,\nand especially, epistemology (tshad ma). Sapa\u1e47 was said\nto have had various doubts and questions about the understanding of\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophy that he had received from his\nearly teachers, which were resolved by his studies under\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012b. He learned to translate under the\ntutelage of Sugata\u015br\u012b, and then together with\n\u015a\u0101kya\u015br\u012b retranslated Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika into Tibetan.\n\nBefore Sapa\u1e47, Sakya was a renowned center for the study of the\nLamdre system of the Hevajra Tantra, rooted in the\nmasterful works and reputation of Sachen Kunga Nyingpo. Sapa\u1e47\nestablished Sakya anew as a leader in the study of epistemology.\nSapa\u1e47 engaged in many public, spirited debates with members of\nrival Tibetan schools and, famously, with visiting Brahmanical\npa\u1e47\u1e0ditas (including one *Harinanda), whom he is\nsaid to have defeated (see Hugon 2012 on this event). His personal\nreputation, and the tantric reputation of Sakya, were surely important\nfactors behind the Mongol prince K\u00f6den inviting him to negotiate\nterms for the Tibetan surrender in 1244. It is not entirely clear just\nwhat the terms turned out to be, and Sapa\u1e47 died in the Mongol\ncapital. But just a few years later, Sapa\u1e47\u2019s nephew\nPhakpa, whom he had brought with him, was named supreme administrator\nof a united Tibet under Mongol rule\u2014a position that stayed with\nthe Sakya for a century (Wylie 1977 [2003] and Petech 1990).\n\nSapa\u1e47 composed many short works, but he is best known for five major\nworks: \n\n Treasury of Aphoristic Jewels (Legs par bshad pa rin\npo che\u2019i gter; Bosson 1969); \n Treasury of Epistemological Reasoning (Tshad ma rigs\npa\u2019i gter; Fukuda et al. 1989\u20131994 and Hugon\n2008);\n Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes (Sdom gsum\nrab dbye; Rhoton 2002); \n Clarifying the Sage\u2019s Intent (Thub pa\u2019i\ndgongs pa rab tu gsal; D. Jackson 2015); and \n Gateway to Learning (Mkhas pa rnams \u2019jug pa\u2019i\nsgo; D. Jackson 1987 and Gold 2007). \n\n\nThe first is a popular collection of pithy sayings and moral\ninstructions (Kolma\u0161 1978); the others are treated further\nbelow. Although it is difficult to summarize his worldview, it is\nhoped that this survey reveals a philosopher of remarkable\nconsistency, vision and depth.\n",
