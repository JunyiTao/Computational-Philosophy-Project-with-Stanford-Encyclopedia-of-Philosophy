    "main_text": "The Soul and the Nature of Living Things\n4. The Soul and the Nature of Living Things\n\nIn common with other early ancient theories of living things,\nDemocritus seems to have used the term psych\u00ea to refer\nto that distinctive feature of living things that accounts for their\nability to perform their life-functions. According to Aristotle,\nDemocritus regarded the soul as composed of one kind of atom, in\nparticular fire atoms. This seems to have been because of the\nassociation of life with heat, and because spherical fire atoms are\nreadily mobile, and the soul is regarded as causing motion. Democritus\nseems to have considered thought to be caused by physical movements of\natoms also. This is sometimes taken as evidence that Democritus denied\nthe survival of a personal soul after death, although the reports are\nnot univocal on this.\n\nOne difficulty faced by materialist theories of living things is to\naccount for the existence and regular reproduction of functionally\nadapted forms in the natural world. Although the atomists have\nconsiderable success in making it plausible that a simple ontology of\natoms and void, with the minimal properties of the former, can account\nfor a wide variety of differences in the objects in the perceptible\nworld, and also that a number of apparently orderly effects can be\nproduced as a byproduct of disorderly atomic collisions, the kind of\nfunctional organization found in organisms is much harder to\nexplain.\n\nDemocritus seems to have developed a view of reproduction according to\nwhich all parts of the body contribute to the seed from which the new\nanimal grows, and that both parents contribute seed (DK 68A141; 143).\nThe theory seems to presuppose that the presence of some material from\neach organ in the seed accounts for the development of that organ in\nthe new organism. Parental characteristics are inherited when the\ncontribution of one or other parent predominates in supplying the\nappropriate part. The offspring is male or female according to which\nof the two seeds predominates in contributing material from the\ngenitals. In an atomist cosmos, the existence of particular species is\nnot considered to be eternal. Like some other early materialist\naccounts, Democritus held that human beings arose from the earth (DK\n68A139), although the reports give little detail.\n",
