    "main_text": "Socrates and Plato\n3. Socrates and Plato\n\nAccording to Cicero, Socrates (469\u2013399 BCE) was the first to\nbring philosophy down from heaven, locating it in cities and even in\npeople\u2019s kitchens (Tusc.V.10). A humbly born man who\nrefused the lucrative mantle of the sophistic professional teacher,\nyet attracted many of the most ambitious and aristocratic youth of\nAthens to accompany him in his questioning of them and their elders as\nto the nature of the virtues they claimed to possess or understand, he\nleft no philosophical writings. We know him only through the surviving\ntestimony of others, first the lampoons in Aristophanes\u2019 comic\nplays, and above all the \u201cSocratic\u201d dialogues written by\nhis student Plato and his associate Xenophon (dialogues by others are\nknown only by titles or fragments), and the remarks of Plato\u2019s\nstudent Aristotle, as well as other sources from after or even long\nafter his death (for a collection, see Giannantoni 1990, and see the\nentry on\n Socrates).\n",
