    "main_text": "Background || The Importance of PAP\n1.1 The Importance of PAP\n\nWe are both moral and embodied agents, persons and organisms. We move\nin the space of reasons, answerable to rules of morality and\nrationality, as well as a space of causes, governed by the laws of\nnature. How are these two aspects of our lives linked? This question\nis too big to answer here. But PAP, if true, is one piece of the\npuzzle. Our status as persons is enabled by a kind of power we\nexercise in the world of causes, namely, the power to choose among\nalternative courses of action. In this way, our principle links a\nnormative feature of our lives to a causal feature.\n\nBut with this abstract promise comes a concrete threat. The principle\ntells us that when alternatives are blocked, when only one course of\naction is available, you are not responsible for what you do. As noted\nearlier, there are some extreme conditions, such as coercion, that can\npreclude responsibility by blocking alternatives. But suppose it turns\nout that even under standard conditions, no one has alternatives.\nGiven PAP, no one is morally responsible for anything. Universal\nalternative-blockers have frequently appeared in the philosophical\nliterature. They include bivalence, divine foreknowledge, divine\nsovereignty, mechanism, psychological determinism, and causal\ndeterminism. If, due to any of these, none of us can act otherwise\nthan we actually act, then PAP will join in to produce a disturbing\nconclusion: we are never responsible for what we do. A less global but\nequally worrisome threat is that our principle will combine with some\nthesis entailing the widespread reduction of abilities, even if not\ntheir elimination. For example, situational, genetic, or\nsocio-economic influences, while not universally blocking\nalternatives, could so severely limit them in particular cases that,\nwith PAP in the background, moral praise and blame are no longer\nappropriate. (On the threat of \u201csituationism\u201d, see Nelkin\n2005; McKenna & Warmke 2017.)\n\nAnother reason PAP is important is that it intersects with the\nphilosophy and practice of law. Even if moral and legal responsibility\ndo not coincide, there is a region of overlap (Duff 2009; Brink &\nNelkin 2013) where PAP and its attendant literature can inform legal\nreasoning, especially when it aims at the just punishment of\nwrongdoers. A necessary condition of criminal responsibility is that\nthe conduct included a voluntary act (Sinnott-Armstrong 2012), one\nthat the accused had a \u201creasonable opportunity to avoid\u201d\n(Kelly 2017). If Mark was sleepwalking or hypnotized when he broke\ninto Ken\u2019s house, this could be excused, both morally and\nlegally, on the grounds that in his condition, Mark could not have\ndone otherwise. If, due to delusion, an accused murderer could not\navoid forming the intention to kill his victim\u2014and acting\naccordingly\u2014this also could be exculpating.\n\nThat said, standards applied by the law may not match what in moral\ncontexts we think of as avoidable action. Imagine that a mild\nprovocation, one that a reasonable person could ignore, compels an\nemotionally disturbed man to murder. Criminal law evaluates his\nabilities according to the reasonable person standard\u2014thereby\nconvicting him of murder rather than manslaughter\u2014even if moral\nreasoning would take into account the emotional state severely\nrestricting his alternatives (Kelly 2017). The relation between PAP\nand the law is further complicated by the fact that criminal law does\nnot seem especially concerned with causal determinism (Morse 2013), a\nthesis widely thought to limit us to exactly one future. That said, if\nthe irrelevance of determinism in the law reflects some degree of\nindifference toward alternatives in assigning responsibility, this\ncould be part of a case against PAP in moral matters as well (see also\n \u00a73.1).\n",
