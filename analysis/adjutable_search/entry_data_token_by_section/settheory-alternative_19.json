This could be a\ngood thing or a bad thing, depending on one\u2019s attitude. If one\nis worried about the consistency of a weakly compact, the level of\nconsistency strength here is certainly a problem (though the theory of\nthe \\(\\omega\\) -hyperuniverse will stay around in any case). On the\nother hand, the fact that the topological motivation for set theory\nseems to work and yields a higher level of consistency strength than\none might expect (\u201cweakly compact\u201d infinity following from\nmerely uncountable infinity) might be taken as evidence that these are\nvery powerful ideas.\n\nThe mathematical constructions that are readily accessible to this\nauthor are simply carried over from ZF or ZFC; the\nwell-founded sets are considered within the world of positive set\ntheory, and we find that they have exactly the properties we expect\nthem to have from the usual viewpoint. It is rather nice that we get\n(fuzzier) objects in our set theory suitable to represent all of the\nusual proper classes; it is less clear what we can do with the other\nlarge objects than it is in NFU. A topologist might find this\nsystem quite interesting; in any event, topological expertise seems\nrequired to evaluate what can be done with the extra machinery in this\nsystem.\n\nWe briefly review the paradoxes: the Russell paradox doesn\u2019t\nwork because \\(x \\not\\in x\\) is not a positive formula; notice that\n\\(\\{x \\mid x \\in x\\}\\) exists! The Cantor paradox does not work\nbecause the proof of the Cantor theorem relies on an instance of\ncomprehension which is not positive. \\(\\wp(V)\\) does exist and is\nequal to \\(V\\). The ordinals are defined by a non-positive condition,\nand do not make up a set, but it is interesting to note that the\nclosure \\(\\mathbf{CL}(On)\\) of the class \\(On\\) of ordinals is equal\nto \\(On \\cup \\{\\mathbf{CL}(On)\\}\\); the closure has itself as its only\nunexpected element.\n",
