    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nBoth logic and ontology are important areas of philosophy covering\nlarge, diverse, and active research projects. These two areas overlap\nfrom time to time and problems or questions arise that concern both.\nThis survey article is intended to discuss some of these areas of\noverlap. In particular, there is no single philosophical problem of\nthe intersection of logic and ontology. This is partly so because the\nphilosophical disciplines of logic and of ontology are themselves\nquite diverse and there is thus the possibility of many points of\nintersection. In the following we will first distinguish different\nphilosophical projects that are covered under the terms\n\u2018logic\u2019 and \u2018ontology\u2019. We will then discuss a\nselection of problems that arise in the different areas of\ncontact.\n\n\u2018Logic\u2019 and \u2018ontology\u2019 are big words in\nphilosophy, and different philosophers have used them in different\nways. Depending on what these philosophers mean by these words, and,\nof course, depending on the philosopher\u2019s views, sometimes there\nare striking claims to be found in the philosophical literature about\ntheir relationship. But when Hegel, for example, uses\n\u2018logic\u2019, or better \u2018Logik\u2019, he means something\nquite different than what is meant by the word in much of the\ncontemporary philosophical scene. We will not attempt to survey the\nhistory of the different conceptions of logic and of ontology, nor the\nhistory of the debate about their relationship. Instead this article\nwill look at this issue fairly top down, with an emphasis on areas of\noverlap that are presently actively debated. For more historical\ninformation, see Kneale and Kneale 1985. Nonetheless, two\nhistorically important figures, namely Gottlob Frege and Immanuel\nKant, will make repeat appearances below.\n",
