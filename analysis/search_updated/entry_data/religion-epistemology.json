    "preamble": "\n\n\nContemporary epistemology of religion may conveniently be treated as a\ndebate over whether evidentialism applies to religious\nbeliefs, or whether we should instead adopt a more permissive\nepistemology. Here evidentialism is the initially plausible position\nthat a belief is justified only if \u201cit is proportioned to the\nevidence\u201d. For example, suppose a local weather forecaster has\nnoticed that over the two hundred years since records began a wetter\nthan average Winter is followed in 85% of cases by a hotter than\naverage Summer. Then, assuming for simplicity that the records are\nreliable, the forecaster is justified in believing with less than full\nconfidence that this Winter, which is wetter than average, will be\nfollowed by a hotter than average Summer. But evidentialism implies\nthat it would not be justified to have full belief, that is belief\nwith 100% confidence. Again, consider someone who has a hunch\nthat this Summer will be hotter than average but cannot justify that\nhunch further. Hunches are not considered evidence, so the belief is\nnot considered justified. If, however, the huncher can cite a good\ntrack record of hunches about the weather that have turned out correct\nthen the belief would be considered justified. For although hunches\nare not considered evidence, memories about past hunches are, as are\nthe observations that corroborated the past hunches.\n Evidentialism implies that full religious belief is justified only\nif there is conclusive evidence for it. It follows that if the\narguments for there being a God, including any arguments from\nreligious experience, are at best probable ones, no one would be\njustified in having a full belief that there is a God. And the same\nholds for other religious beliefs, such as the belief that God is not\njust good in a utilitarian fashion but loving, or the belief that\nthere is an afterlife.  Likewise it would be unjustified to believe\neven with less than full confidence that, say, Krishna is divine or\nthat Mohammed is the last and most authoritative of the prophets,\nunless a good case can be made for these claims from the evidence.\n Evidentialism, then, sets rather high standards for justification,\nstandards that the majority do not, it would seem, meet when it comes\nto religious beliefs, where many rely on \u201cfaith\u201d, which is\nmore like the forecaster\u2019s hunch about the weather than the argument\nfrom past climate records. Many others take some body of scripture,\nsuch as the Bible or the Koran as of special authority, contrary to\nthe evidentialist treatment of these as just like any other\nbooks making various claims.  Are these standards too high?\n This century has seen a turn in the debate, with emphasis on the\nimplications of disagreement, \u201cHow can sincere intelligent\npeople disagree? Should not we all suspend judgement?\u201d\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Simplifications\n\n\nEpistemology is confusing because there are several sorts of items to\nbe evaluated and several sorts of evaluation. Since the topic of this\narticle is the epistemology of religion not general epistemology it\nwill be assumed that what is being evaluated is something related to\nfaith, namely individual religious beliefs, and that the way of\nevaluating religious beliefs is as justified or unjustified.\nThis entry, therefore, concentrates on questions such as, \u201cIs\nit justified for Fatima to believe in God?\u201d, \u201cIs it\njustified for Richard to believe in the Trinity?\u201d, or \u201cIs\nit justified for Ramanujan to believe that Krishna is a human\nincarnation of the divine?\u201d It ignores such questions as whether\nthese beliefs count as knowledge or whether these beliefs are\nscientific. It also ignores disputes between coherence theorists and\nfoundationalists and disputes over whether belief is\nvoluntary. Although these have some implications for the epistemology\nof religion they are primarily topics in general epistemology.\nAlthough the topic is religious belief the same questions can be\nasked about faith in the absence of belief, where the standards might\nbe more lax. For example John Schellenberg (2009) has argued that it is\nnot justified to believe in a personal God, not justified to have\nfaith in a personal God , not justified even to believe in something\nultimate but it is justified to have a religious attitude of faith in\nsomething ultimate.  Finally, and more controversially, this entry\nconcentrates on Western epistemology of religion, which is not,\nhowever, the same as the epistemology of Western religion. Note,\nthough, that epistemological disputes between Hindu and Buddhist\nphilosophers over a thousand years ago are much the same as those here\nconsidered.\n2. The Rejection of Enlightenment Evidentialism\n\n\nMost contemporary epistemology of religion may be called post\nmodern in the sense of being a reaction to the Enlightenment, in\nparticular to the thesis of the hegemony of\nevidentialism. (Compare Vanhoozer 2003.)  Hegemony is discussed below,\nbut first consider evidentialism. This is the initially plausible\nposition that a belief is justified only if \u201cit is proportioned\nto the evidence\u201d. (Beliefs proportioned to the evidence include,\nas a special case, the evidence itself.) Here several sorts of\nevidence are allowed. One consists of beliefs in that which is\n\u201cevident to the senses\u201d, that is, beliefs directly due to\nsense-experience. Another sort of evidence is that which is\n\u201cself-evident\u201d, that is, obvious once you think about\nit. Evidence may also include the beliefs directly due to memory and\nintrospection. Again moral convictions might count as evidence, even\nif not treated as \u201cself-evident\u201d. But in order to state\nthe sort of evidentialism characteristic of Enlightenment thought, it\nis stipulated that no beliefs asserting the content of religious or\nmystical experiences count as evidence.  For example, if Fatima had an\nexperience that she would describe as of the presence of God she\nshould not treat God\u2019s presence to her as a piece of evidence.  That\ndoes not prevent the claim that someone has had a religious experience\nwith a certain content from counting as evidence. For example, the\nfact that Fatima had an experience as if of God\u2019s presence would be a\npiece of evidence.  Likewise the fact that various people report\nmiracles counts as evidence.\n\n\nEvidentialism implies that no full religious belief (i.e., a religious\nbelief held with full confidence) is justified unless there is\nconclusive evidence for it, or it is self-evident. The content of\nreligious experience has been stipulated not to count as\nevidence. Even if, as Descartes held, the existence of God is\nself-evident, beliefs such as Richard\u2019s in the Trinity and\nRamanujan\u2019s in the divinity of Krishna are not. So the only\navailable evidence for these beliefs would seem to be non-religious\npremises, from which the religious beliefs are inferred. Therefore,\nthe only way of deciding whether the religious beliefs are justified\nwould be to examine various arguments with the non-religious beliefs\nas premises and the religious beliefs as conclusions.\n\n\nAccording to evidentialism it follows that if the arguments for there\nbeing a God, including any arguments from religious experience, are at\nbest probable ones, and if, as most hold, God\u2019s existence is not\nself-evident then no one would be justified in having full belief that\nthere is a God. And the same holds for other religious\nbeliefs. Likewise, it would not be justified to believe even partially\n(i.e., with less than full confidence) if there is not a balance of\nevidence for belief.\n\n\nIn fact it seems that many religious believers combine full belief\nwith \u201cdoubts\u201d in the sense of some reasons for doubting,\nor they combine partial belief with what they take to be weighty\nreasons for disbelief. According to evidentialism this is not\njustified. Other believers consider that, on reflection, they have\nlittle reason for doubting but that they have almost no positive\nevidence for their religious beliefs. According to evidentialism this\ntoo is unjustified.  This raises the question, how can we adjudicate\nbetween an epistemological thesis which might otherwise be believed\nand a religious belief which that thesis implies is unjustified?  The\nEnlightenment assumed two related, hegemony theses, those of\nepistemology and of evidentialism. The hegemony of epistemology states\nthat (a) human beings can discover the correct epistemology in\nisolation from discovering actual human tendencies to form beliefs,\nand so (b) there is an overriding reason to use the correct\nepistemology (once discovered) to correct the above-mentioned\ntendencies.  The hegemony of evidentialism adds to the hegemony of\nepistemology the further thesis that (c) evidentialism is the correct\nepistemology. If, according to evidentialism, full or even partial\nreligious beliefs are unjustified, then, given the hegemony of\nevidentialism there is an overriding reason to reject those beliefs.\nPerhaps the clearest exponent of this position is the comparatively\nrecent Clifford whose use of moral vocabulary conveys well the\noverriding character of the reasons epistemology is said to provide.\nHis position is summed up in the famous quotation: \u201cIt is wrong\nalways, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon\ninsufficient evidence\u201d (Clifford 1879: 186).\n\n\nAt the other extreme from Clifford is the position of\nfideism, namely, that if an epistemological theory such as\nevidentialism conflicts with the holding of religious beliefs\nthen that is so much the worse for the epistemological theory.\n\n\nThe rejection of the hegemony of epistemology is quite compatible\nwith holding a hegemony thesis for a fragment of epistemology. Such a\nfragment might, for instance, contain the principle of\nself-referential consistency, relied upon by Plantinga (1983:\n60). This states that it is not justified to have a belief according\nto which that belief is itself not justified. Consider, for instance,\nthe extreme case of the person who believes that no belief is\njustified unless it can be proven from premises everyone agrees\nupon. \n\n\nPostmodernism implies more than being post modern in the above sense.\nFor it is the rejection of the hegemony of even a fragment of\nepistemology. That might seem agreeable to fideists.  Postmodernism\ntends, however, to trivialize fideism by obliterating any contrast\nbetween faith in divine revelation and trust in human capacities to\ndiscover the truth. (For a discussion of fideism and postmodernism see\nStiver 2003.) \n\n\nMuch contemporary epistemology of religion seeks to avoid the extremes\nboth of the Enlightenment thesis of the hegemony of evidentialism and\nof fideism. It is thus post modern without necessarily being\npostmodernist. Call the injunction to avoid these extremes\nthe problematic of contemporary epistemology of religion.\n3. Evidentialism Defended\n\n\nOne response to the problematic is to separate evidentialism from the\nhegemony of epistemology. Evidentialism may then be defended by noting\nhow we implicitly rely upon evidentialist principles in many different\nareas of enquiry, or by noting which principles generalise various\nparticular examples of justified  and unjustified\nreasoning.  Such a defence of evidentialism is part of\nthe project of some contemporary philosophers who seek to attack\ntheism in favour of agnosticism and/or atheism. This defence may well\nbe implicit in Flew\u2019s famous \u201cThe Presumption of Atheism\u201d\n(1972). It is more explicit in Scriven\u2019s\nPrimary Philosophy (1966, ch 4). Scriven and Flew are relying\non the Ockhamist principle that, in the absence of evidence for the\nexistence of things of kind X, belief in Xs is\nnot reasonable.  This they can defend by means of examples in which\nnon-Ockhamist thinking is judged not to be justified. So even if the\nwhole of evidentialism is not defended, the Ockhamist fragment of it\nmay be.\n\n\nNot surprisingly the reliance of non-theist philosophers on\nevidentialism has been criticised. First there is an ad hominem.\nShalkowski (1989) has pointed out that these defenders of\nevidentialism tend in fact to be atheists not agnostics, yet a careful\nexamination, he says, of the examples used to support Ockham\u2019s\nRazor show that either they are ones in which there is independent\nevidence for denying the existence of Xs or ones in which\nsuspense of judgement seems to be the appropriate response, not\ndenial. Another criticism is Plantinga\u2019s claim that\nevidentialism is self-referentially inconsistent for there is no\nevidence for evidentialism (Plantinga 1983: 60). This might be met in\neither of two ways. First, it could be said that all that is being\ndefended is the Ockhamist fragment of evidentialism and that this is\nnot itself vulnerable to Ockham\u2019s Razor. Or it could be argued\nthat deriving an epistemology from a wide range of examples is\nevidence for it. To be sure this is far from conclusive evidence. But\neven a less than full belief in an epistemological thesis which showed\ntheism to be unjustified would be damaging. This may be illustrated\nusing an example with artificial numerical precision: 80% confidence\nin an epistemology which showed that no degree of belief in theism\ngreater than 60% was justified is incompatible with a degree of belief\nin theism greater than 68%.  The person in question could have a\ndegree of belief of in the conjunction of theism and the (80% likely)\nepistemology of no greater than 48% (80% of 60%) and a degree of\nbelief in the conjunction of theism and the denial of that\nepistemology of no greater than 20% (since that epistemology has a\nprobability of 80%).\n\n4. Natural theology\n\n\nTheistic philosophers may, of course, grant evidentialism and even\ngrant its hegemony, but defend theism by providing the case which\nevidentialists demand. Here the details of the arguments are not\nwithin the scope of an article on epistemology. What is of interest is\nthe kind of argument put forward. For a start there is the\nproject of demonstrating God\u2019s existence, and this project is\nnot restricted to neo-Thomists. (See Craig 1979, Braine 1988, Miller\n1991.) To show the justifiability of full belief that there is a God\nit is sufficient (a) to have a deductively valid argument from\npremisses which are themselves justifiably held with full belief\nunless defeated by an objection and (b) to have considered and\ndefeated all available objections to either the premisses, the\nconclusion or any intermediate steps. Some of the premisses of these\narguments are said to be self-evident, that is, obvious once you think\nabout it. (E.g., the denial of the explanatory power of an infinite\ncausal regress, or the principle that the existence of any composite\nthing needs to be explained). And that raises a further\nepistemological problem. Does something\u2019s being self-evident to you\njustify your full belief in it even if you know of those of equal or\ngreater intellectual ability to whom it is not self-evident?\n\n\nMany natural theologians have, however, abandoned the search for\ndemonstrative arguments, appealing instead to ones which are probable,\neither in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive or in the\nsense of having a mathematical probability assigned to them. Notable\nin this regard are Mitchell\u2019s cumulative argument (Mitchell 1973) and\nSwinburne\u2019s Bayesian reliance on probability (Swinburne 1979). In a\npopular exposition of his argument Swinburne appeals instead to an\ninference to the best explanation (Swinburne 1995; see also Forrest\n1996). While there are differences of approach, the common theme is\nthat there is evidence for theism but evidence of a probable rather\nthan a conclusive kind, justifying belief but not full belief.\n5. The Relevance of Newman\n\n\nAlthough pre-dating the current debate, John Henry Newman\u2019s\nrejection of Locke\u2019s and Paley\u2019s evidentialism is relevant\nto the problematic of contemporary epistemology of religion. First he\nquite clearly rejected the hegemony of epistemology. His procedure was\nto examine how in fact people made up their minds on non-religious\nissues and argue that by the same standards religious beliefs were\njustified. As a result he qualified evidentialism by insisting that\nan implicit and\ncumulative argument could lead to justified certainty. (See\nMitchell 1990.) \n\n\nNewman\u2019s position has two interpretations. One, which differs little\nfrom Swinburne\u2019s probabilistic approach to natural theology, asserts\nthat the consilience of a number of independent pieces of probable\nreasoning can result in a probability so high as to be negligibly\ndifferent from certainty. If, to use an example Newman would not have\nliked, Aquinas\u2019s five ways were independent and each had probability\n75% then taken together their probability is about 99.9%. One\ndifficulty with this interpretation is that even a highly probable\nargument differs from a demonstration in that the former is vulnerable\nto probabilistic counter-arguments. Thus a probabilistic version of\nthe Argument from Evil might subsequently reduce the probability from\n99.9% down to 75% again.\n\n\nThe other interpretation of Newman\u2019s position is to say that\nevidentialism falsely presupposes that there are fine gradations on a\nscale from full belief through partial belief to partial disbelief to\nfull disbelief. Newman claims that human beings are not like that when\nit comes to those beliefs which form part of religious faith. In such\ncases the only available states are those of full belief and full\ndisbelief or, perhaps, full belief, and lack of full belief. Of course\nsomeone can believe that theism has a probability between 90% and 60%,\nsay, but that could be interpreted as believing that relative to the\nevidence theism has a probability between 90% and 60%, which, in turn,\nis a comment on the strength of the case for theism not the expression\nof a merely partial belief.\n\n\nIf Newman is right then evidentialism is slightly wrong. Instead of\nrequiring belief to be proportioned to the evidence, full belief is\njustified if the case for it holds \u201con the balance of\nprobabilities\u201d.  Hence a natural theology consisting of merely\nprobable arguments, such as Swinburne\u2019s, can still show full\nreligious belief to be justified.\n6. Wittgensteinian Fideism\n\n\nAnother reaction to the problematic is Wittgensteinian fideism, the\nthesis that there are various different \u201clanguage games\u201d,\nand that while it is appropriate to ask questions about justification\nwithin a language game it is a mistake to ask about the justification\nof \u201cplaying\u201d the game in question. In this way\nepistemology is relativised to language games, themselves related to\nforms of life, and the one used for assessing religious claims is less\nstringent than evidentialism. Here there seems to be both an autonomy\nthesis and an incommensurability thesis. The autonomy thesis tells us\nthat religious utterances are only to be judged as justified or\notherwise by the standards implicit in the religious form of life, and\nthis may be further restricted to Christianity or Hinduism, or any\nother religion (Malcolm 1992). The incommensurability thesis tells us\nthat religious utterances are unlike scientific or metaphysical claims\nand so we are confusing different uses of language if we judge\nreligious utterances by the standards of science or metaphysics\n(Phillips 1992). Stress on the autonomy thesis brings Wittgensteinian\nfideism close to the fideism of many religious conservatives, but\nstress on the incommensurability thesis brings it close to the extreme\nliberal position of Braithwaite (1955), namely that religion is about\nattitudes not facts, which would, of course, be rejected by religious\nconservatives.\n\n\nPerhaps the most obvious criticism of Wittgensteinian fideism is that\neven if the underlying theory of forms of life and language games is\ngranted, it is an historical fact, itself justified by the criteria of\nthe \u201cgame\u201d of history, that the tradition to which the\nmajority of Jews, Christians and Muslims belong to is a form of life\nwith heavy metaphysical commitments, and in which such utterances as\n\u201cThere is a God\u201d are intended as much like \u201cThere is\na star ten times more massive than the Sun\u201d as like \u201cThere\nis hope\u201d. So Wittgensteinian fideism is only appropriate for\nsuch religions as Zen Buddhism and for some, relatively recent,\nliberal strands of Judaism and Christianity which have rejected the\ntraditional metaphysical commitment (as in Cupitt 1984).\n\nThe Wittgensteinian position could be modified to allow a metaphysical\n\u201clanguage game\u201d with its own criteria for justification\netc, and in which natural theology should be pursued. Then the\nJudeo-Christian-Islamic \u201clanguage game\u201d would be part of\nthis larger, autonomous metaphysical \u201clanguage game\u201d. That\nmodified account would cohere with the historical fact of the\nmetaphysical commitment of that religious tradition. In that case,\nthough, it would seem that, not just the Judeo-Christian-Islamic\n\u201clanguage game\u201d, but all serious intellectual enquiry\nshould also be treated as parts of the one \u201cgame\u201d, with\none set of rules. Thus Wittgensteinian fideism would have been\nqualified out of existence.\n\n\nEven if you reject Wittgensteinian fideism you might still take a lesson\nfrom it. For it must surely be granted that religious utterances are\nnot made in a purely intellectual way. Their entanglement with\ncommitment to a way of life and their emotional charge might help to\nexplain the fact, if it is one, that those who take religion\nseriously, whether believers or not, do not in fact have a continuous\nrange of degrees of confidence but operate instead with full belief or\nfull disbelief. For, normally, emotionally charged beliefs are either\nfull on or full off, and in abnormal cases tend to be divided rather\nthan partial. Thus, confronted with conflicting evidence about whether\nyour affection is reciprocated you are far less likely to suspend\njudgement than to oscillate between full belief and full\ndisbelief. Likewise it seems more normal to oscillate between full\nbelief in God in moments of crisis and full disbelief when things go\nwell than to suspend judgement at all times. This ties in with the\nNewmanian modification of evidentialism, mentioned above.\n7. Reformed Epistemology\n\n\nAn influential contemporary rejection of evidentialism is reformed\nepistemology, due to Wolterstorff (1976) and Plantinga (1983). As\nPlantinga develops it in his paper (1983), beliefs\nare warranted without Enlightenment-approved evidence\nprovided they are (a) grounded, and (b) defended against known\nobjections. Such beliefs may then themselves be used as evidence for\nother beliefs. But what grounding amounts to could be debated. Later,\nPlantinga proposed an account of warrant as proper functioning. This\naccount seems to entail that S\u2019s belief that p\nis grounded in event E if (a) in the circumstances E\ncaused S to believe that p, and\n(b) S\u2019s coming to believe that p was a case of\nproper functioning (Plantinga 1993b). It should be noted that the term\n\u201cwarrant\u201d used elsewhere in philosophy as a synonym for\n\u201cjustified\u201d (as in \u201cwarranted assertibility\u201d)\nis used by Plantinga to mean that which has to be adjoined to a true\nbelief for it to be knowledge. (See Plantinga 1993a). Accordingly the\nmost pressing criticism of Plantinga\u2019s later position is that it\nlargely ignores the question of justification, or reasonableness\nwhich, as Swinburne explicates it (Swinburne 2001) amounts to whether\nthe religious beliefs are probable relative to total evidence.\n\n\nWhile the details of grounding might be controversial it may be assumed\nthat reformed epistemologists  assert that ordinary religious\nexperiences of awe, gratitude, contrition, etc., ground the beliefs\nimplied by the believer\u2019s sincere reports of such experiences, provided\nthey can be said to cause those beliefs. Such grounded beliefs are\nwarranted provided they can be defended against known objections. They\ncan then be used as evidence for further religious beliefs. Thus if\nreligious experience grounds the belief that God has forgiven you for\ndoing what is wrong to other humans beings, then that is evidence for a\npersonal God who acts in a morally upright fashion. For, it can be\nargued, only such a God would find anything to forgive in the wrongs you\ndo to your fellow human beings.\n\n\nJerome Gellman (1992, 2017) draws our attention to the experience of\ngodlessness. This is occasioned by, but not inferred from, the evils\nthat surround us. If Reformed Epistemology is correct this would seem\nto ground atheism in the same way that the experience of forgiveness\ncan ground theism.\n\n\nOne difference between reformed epistemology and fideism is that the\nformer requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter\nmight dismiss such objections as either irrelevant or, worse,\nintellectual temptations. Included in the objections are not only\nthose such as the Argument from Evil that seek to rebut, but arguments\nfrom sociology and, more recently, cognitive science that seek to\nundermine by proposing a naturalistic cause for basic religious\nbeliefs. For instance, Justin Barrett (2004) posits a HADD\n(hyperactive/hypersensitive agency detection device), suggesting that\na sensitive agency detection device functions properly if the goal is\nsurvival but is hypersensitive if the goal is truth. This\nhypersensitivity then explains the human tendency towards supernatural\nbeliefs, undermining the proper basicality of those beliefs. Clark and\nBarrett (2011) suggest that this hypersensitivity could itself be part\nof the divine plan. An alternative, Bayesian, theistic response would\nbe that HADD exaggerates a properly basic probability for theism that\nis neither high nor too low prior to further evidence. This justifies\na part evidentialist, part reformed, program of assessing the\nall-things-considered probability resulting from the effect of\nevidence on this basic probability.\n\nA difference between reformed epistemology and Wittgensteinian fideism\nis that the former proposes a universal relaxation of the stringent\nconditions of evidentialism while the latter only proposes a\nrelaxation for some\u201clanguage games\u201d, including\nreligion.\n\n\nReformed epistemology could be correct and yet far less significant\nthan its proponents take it to be. That would occur if in fact rather\nfew religious beliefs are grounded in the sorts of ordinary religious\nexperiences most believers have. For it may well be that the beliefs\nare part of the cause of the experience rather than the other way round\n(Katz 1978).\n8. Religious Experience, Revelation and Tradition\n\nReformed epistemology might be thought of as a modification of\nevidentialism in which the permissible kinds of evidence are expanded.\nNotable in  this context is Alston\u2019s work arguing that\ncertain kinds of religious experience can be assimilated to perception\n(Alston 1991).\n\n\nThe difference between reformed epistemology and Enlightenment-style\nevidentialism is also shown by a consideration of revelation and\ninspiration. An evidentialist will consider arguments from the premiss\nthat it is said such and such was revealed or the premiss that so and\nso claimed to be inspired by God, but a reformed epistemologist might\nallow as warranted those religious beliefs grounded in the event of\nrevelation or inspiration.  Thus Mavrodes has argued that any belief\ndue to a genuine revelation is warranted, and has discussed several\nmodes of revelation (Mavrodes 1988). Zagzebski argues that this would\nhave the unacceptable consequence that warrant, and hence knowledge,\nbecomes totally inaccessible either to the person concerned\nor the community (Zagzebski 1993a: 204\u2013205). For instance, Mavrodes\nwould probably not consider Ramanujan\u2019s belief that Krishna is divine\nas warranted, but even if Mavrodes is correct Ramanujan would have no\naccess to this truth about the unwarranted character of his own\nbeliefs.  A similar criticism could be made of beliefs grounded in\nreligious experience. In both cases, the question of whether a belief\nis genuinely grounded in religious experience or is genuinely grounded\nin inspiration is one that several religious traditions have paid\nattention to, with such theories as that of discernment of spirits\n(Murphy, 1990, ch 5).\n\n\nIn what might be called \u201ccounter-reformed epistemology\u201d\nit could be allowed that a belief can be warranted if grounded in a\nreligious tradition. Such a belief would have to be caused in the right\nsort of way by the right sort of tradition. As in the previous cases we\nmight note that such grounding should be partially accessible to the\nbeliever. Rather little work has been done on this\nextension of reformed epistemology, but the social dimension of warrant\nhas been noted (Zagzebski 1993a).\n\n\nMore recently Plantinga (2000) has defended a rather different account of\ndivine inspiration, which he calls the Aquinas/Calvin model. This\nrelies upon the doctrine of \u2018original sin\u2019 claiming that\nmost humans suffer from a cognitive-affective disorder, but that as a\nresult of Redemption the Holy Spirit heals us so that we are able to\nfunction properly, and come to believe the Christian revelation in an\nimmediate, non-inferential manner. In this way the Aquinas/Calvin\nmodel supports the Christian metaphysics, which in turn supports the\nAquinas/Calvin model. Presumably it will be granted that the\nprobability, y, of the Aquinas/Calvin model given Christian\nmetaphysics is significantly less than 100%, because there are rival\nChristian models. As a consequence, the probability, z, of\nChristian metaphysics is less than x/(1\u2212y)\nwhere x is the probability of Christian metaphysics given the\nfalsity of the Aquinas/Calvin model. Hence Plantinga\u2019s proposal can\nsucceed only if either y is near 100% or x is not\ntoo small.\n9. Religious Disagreement\n\n\nReligious disagreement is a long-standing problem in philosophy of\nreligion, but in this century there has been great interest in\ndisagreements between theists and atheists as well as the\ndisagreements between followers of various religions. (See Kelly 2005,\nChristensen 2007, Feldman 2007, Kraft 2007, Feldman and Warfield 2011,\nChristensen and Lackey 2013) The problem here is obvious: how can\nsincere intelligent people disagree?  Should not both disputants\nsuspend judgement? To be sure, sometimes those who disagree with you\nare your intellectual inferiors in some respect. Consider, for\ninstance, someone who insisted that \u03c0 was precisely 22/7. Those who\nknow of and can follow a proof that \u03c0 is an irrational number may\njustifiably dismiss that person as a mathematical ignoramus.  The case\nof interest, however, is that in which no such inferiority is on\npublic display. This is referred to as a situation of public\nepistemic parity.  Richard Feldman criticizes the relativist\nsolution to the problem, namely that there is not always a unique\nreasonable doxastic attitude to a given proposition in a given\nepistemic situation. He also rejects unargued dismissal, and reaches\nthe conclusion that in situations of epistemic parity disputants\nshould suspend judgement. Many, however, agree with Peter van Inwagen\nwho, in his autobiographical \u2018Quam Delicta\u2019 (1994),\nimplies that it is justified for both parties in a dispute to appeal\nto what is privately available to them. Such private assertions of\nepistemic superiority are often expressed by saying that someone\n\u201cjust does not get the point\u201d. Typically, not getting the\npoint requires a cognitive blind-spot. It is not that you know there\nis a point you cannot grasp, which reasonably requires some deference\nto those who claim to grasp it.  You fail to see there is a point. A\nsomewhat different response to Feldman is that of Forrest (2019), who\nargues that when the cases for and against a thesis are of different\nkinds we may sometimes commit to the thesis, because\nnon-comparability is not the same as epistemic parity.\n\n\nOne obvious complication concerning religious disagreements is the\nappeal to divine inspiration, as a source of private epistemic\nsuperiority, as in Plantinga\u2019s \u201cAquinas/Calvin\u201d model\n(Plantinga 2000).  It is hard to see, though, how this could apply to\ndisputes between two religions that both rely on the role of divine\ninspiration. Perhaps the only substitute for unargued dismissal is\nargued dismissal. \n",
