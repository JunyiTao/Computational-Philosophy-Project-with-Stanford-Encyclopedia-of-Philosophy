    "main_text": "Augustine; Lucian\u2019s Humorous Dialectical Engagement\n4. Augustine; Lucian\u2019s Humorous Dialectical Engagement\n\nIn 1501, at the age of 23, More was invited by William Grocyn, the\nrector of St. Lawrence Jewry in central London, to give lectures on\nAugustine\u2019s City of God. According to Thomas Stapleton,\nMore \u201cdid not treat this great work from the theological point\nof view, but from the standpoint of history and philosophy\u201d\n(1588 [1928: 8\u20139]). In the same year, under Grocyn\u2019s\ninstruction, he began the serious study of Greek (EW 269.21,\n24). He mastered it in three years\u2014to such an extent that he\ncould then challenge Erasmus to a Greek-translating contest that\nresulted in his first publication, in 1506 of Lucian Dialogues and\nDeclamations (EW 17\u201359; CW 3.1]). \n\nIn choosing the content of this first publication, as R. R. McCutcheon\nobserved, \u201cThomas More began his career as a dialogist \u2026\nby collaborating with Erasmus as a translator of Lucian\u201d (1993:\n357). The three Lucian dialogues that More translated all humorously\nsatirize supposed philosophers\u2019 \u201carrogant\npronouncements\u201d and \u201cfruitless contentions\u201d (1510\nEW 20.10, 56). For the same publication, More also challenged\nErasmus to write responses to a declamation on tyrannicide\u2014a\nsurprising topic for a first original publication, revealing, as\nErasmus would later point out, his friend\u2019s \u201cspecial\nhatred of tyranny\u201d (1519 letter to von Hutten [EW\n1371.17]). More\u2019s declamation set forth a theory about tyranny\nand how the tyrant differs from other criminal leaders. The\ndeclamation also speaks of civic liberty and the type of civic virtues\nneeded to maintain liberty, that \u201cmost precious\u201d gift\nwilled by the gods (1506 EW 59.13\u201341).\n\nMore\u2019s choice to translate three comic depictions of philosophic\nconfusion calls to mind The City of God\u2019s lengthy\nexpositions of the perennial disagreements among philosophers.\nAugustine cites, for example, the failure of philosophers to agree on\nany \u201cuniversal\u201d guide to life (10.41); the ongoing\n\u201cwars\u201d between schools of thought, resulting in its own\nBabel (18.41); Varro\u2019s distinguishing 288 different sects of\nphilosophy (19.1); and Cicero\u2019s admission that only a very few\nachieve \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d\u2014and that by a gift from\nGod (22.22). Throughout his life More quoted Augustine more than any\nother author (see Concordances in\n Other Internet Resources),\n but nonetheless he early on wrote:\n\n\nBeing a man, [Augustine] could make a mistake. I take his word as\nseriously as anyone\u2019s, but I take no man\u2019s word\nunconditionally. (21 October <1515> letter to Martin Dorp\n[EW 405. 5\u20137; CW 15: 69.4\u20136])\n\n\nMore affirmed this independence of mind dramatically at the end of his\nlife, in prison:\n\n\nI never intend (God being my good lord) to pin my soul at another\nman\u2019s back, not even the best man that I know this day living,\nfor I know not wither he may hap to carry it. There is no man living\nof whom, while he liveth, I may make myself sure. (<August 1534>\nletter of Margaret Roper to Alice Alington [EW\n1314.52\u201357])\n\n\nFor his own children, More insisted on an education ordered to\n\u201cgood judgment\u201d and the ability to listen to popular\nopinion without being overly swayed by it (<1521> letter to\nMargaret Roper [EW 314.79\u201380]; 22 May <1518>\nletter to William Gonell [EW 289.80\u201383]). A main reason\nfor his decision to translate Lucian\u2019s comic dialogues was the\nGreek satirist\u2019s \u201cfirst rate\u201d ability to probe\ndeeply without disturbing the reader\u2019s \u201cequanimity\n[aequo animo]\u201d (1506 letter to Ruthall [EW 20\nn.1]). Like Socrates, More\u2019s major philosophic interest was the\nproperly ordered soul equipped to seek truth and virtue not victory\nand applause (c. 1518 letter to Gonell [EW 288\u201390]).\nBut unlike Socrates, More\u2019s final Socratic dialogues make clear\nthat truth and virtue can be found\u2014with the assistance of\nrevelation\u2014and not merely sought.\n",
