    "main_text": "Systems\n2. Systems\n\nOne popular answer ties being a law to deductive systems. The idea\ndates back to Mill (1843, 384), but has been defended in one form or\nanother by Ramsey (1978 [f.p. 1928]), Lewis (1973, 1983, 1986,\n1994),  Earman (1984) and Loewer (1996). Deductive systems\nare individuated by their axioms. The logical consequences of the\naxioms are the theorems. Some true deductive systems will be stronger\nthan others; some will be simpler than others. These two virtues,\nstrength and simplicity, compete. (It is easy to make a system\nstronger by sacrificing simplicity: include all the truths as\naxioms. It is easy to make a system simple by sacrificing strength:\nhave just the axiom that 2 + 2 = 4.) According to Lewis (1973, 73),\nthe laws of nature belong to all the true deductive systems with a\nbest combination of simplicity and strength. So, for example,\nthe thought is that it is a law that all uranium spheres are less than\na mile in diameter because it is, arguably, part of the best deductive\nsystems; quantum theory is an excellent theory of our universe and\nmight be part of the best systems, and it is plausible to think that\nquantum theory plus truths describing the nature of uranium would\nlogically entail that there are no uranium spheres of that size\n(Loewer 1996, 112). It is doubtful that the generalization that all\ngold spheres are less than a mile in diameter would be part of the\nbest systems. It could be added as an axiom to any system, but it\nwould bring little or nothing of interest in terms of strength and\nadding it would sacrifice something in terms of simplicity. (Lewis\nlater made significant revisions to his account in order to address\nproblems involving physical probability (Lewis 1986, 1994).\n\nMany features of the systems approach are appealing. For one thing,\nit deals with a challenge posed by vacuous laws. Some laws are\nvacuously true: Newton\u2019s first law of motion \u2014 that all\ninertial bodies have no acceleration \u2014 is a law, even though\nthere are no inertial bodies. But there are also lots of vacuously\ntrue nonlaws: all plaid pandas weigh 5 lbs., all unicorns are\nunmarried, etc. With the systems approach, there is no exclusion of\nvacuous generalizations from the realm of laws, and yet only those\nvacuous generalizations that belong to the best systems qualify (cf.,\nLewis 1986, 123). Furthermore, one goal of scientific theorizing\nis the formulation of true theories that are well balanced in terms of\ntheir simplicity and strength. So, the systems approach seems to\nunderwrite the truism that an aim of science is the discovery of laws\n(Earman 1978, 180; Loewer 1996, 112). One last aspect of the systems\nview that is appealing to many (though not all) is that it is in\nkeeping with broadly Humean constraints on a sensible metaphysics.\nThere is no overt appeal to closely related modal concepts (e.g., the\ncounterfactual conditional, causation, dispositions) and no overt\nappeal to modality-supplying entities (e.g., universals or God; for\nthe supposed need to appeal to God, see Foster 2004). Indeed, the\nsystems approach is the centerpiece of Lewis\u2019s defense of\nHumean supervenience, \u201cthe doctrine that all there is\nin the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of particular fact,\njust one little thing and then another\u201d (1986, ix).\n\nOther aspects of the systems approach make philosophers wary. (See,\nespecially, Armstrong 1983, 66\u201373; van Fraassen 1989,\n40\u201364; Carroll 1990, 197\u2013206.) Some argue that this\napproach will have the untoward consequence that laws are\ninappropriately mind-dependent in virtue of the account\u2019s appeal\nto the concepts of simplicity, strength and best balance, concepts\nwhose instantiation seems to depend on cognitive abilities, interests,\nand purposes. The appeal to simplicity raises further questions\nstemming from the apparent need for a regimented language to permit\nreasonable comparisons of the systems (Lewis 1983, 367.) More\nrecently, Roberts questions the systems approach at a point sometimes\nthought to be a strength of the view: \u201cWe have no practice of\nweighing competing virtues of simplicity and information content for\nthe purpose of choosing one deductive system over others, where all\nare presumed to be true\u201d (2008, 10). There is the practice of\ncurve-fitting, which involves weighing the competing virtues of\nsimplicity and closeness of fit, but this is a practice that is part\nof the process of discovering what is true. Also, the systems\napproach is ill-suited to rule out widespread and striking\nregularities as laws, even those that are clearly determined by the\ninitial conditions. That the universe is closed, that entropy\ngenerally increases, that the planets of our solar system are\nco-planar, and others (if true) could be added to any true deductive\nsystem, greatly increasing the strength of the system, with only a\nsmall cost in terms of simplicity (Maudlin 2007, 16; Roberts 2008,\n23). Interestingly, sometimes the systems view is abandoned\nbecause it satisfies the broadly Humean constraints\non laws of nature; some argue that what generalizations are laws\nis not determined by local matters of particular fact. (See Section 4\nbelow.) Though Humeans like Lewis generally favor realism to any form\nof anti-realism (Section 5 below), Berenstain and Ladyman (2012)\nhave argued that scientific realism is incompatible with Humeanism\nbecause realism requires a notion of natural necessity not susceptible\nto Humean analysis.\n",
