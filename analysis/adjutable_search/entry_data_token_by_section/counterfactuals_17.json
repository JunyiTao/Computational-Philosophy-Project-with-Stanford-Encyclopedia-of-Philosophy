    "main_text": "Semantic Theories of Counterfactual Dependence || Summary\n3.4 Summary\n\nPremise semantics\n (3.1),\n conditional probability analyses\n (\u00a73.2)\n and structural equation analyses\n (\u00a73.3)\n all aim to analyze counterfactuals by focusing on certain relations\nbetween facts, rather than similarities between worlds. These accounts\nmake clearer and more accurate predictions about particular\ncounterfactuals in context than similarity analyses. But, ultimately,\nboth premise semantics and conditional probability analyses had to\nincorporate causal dependence into their theories. Structural equation\nanalyses do this from the start, and improve further on the\npredictions of premise semantics and conditional probability analyses.\nAnother strength of this analysis is that it integrates elegantly into\nthe broader applications of counterfactuals in theories of\nrationality, mental representation, causation, and scientific\nexplanation surveyed in\n \u00a71.1.\n There is still rapid development of structural equation analyses,\nthough, so it is too early to say where the analysis will stabilize,\nor how it will fair under thorough critical examination.\n",
