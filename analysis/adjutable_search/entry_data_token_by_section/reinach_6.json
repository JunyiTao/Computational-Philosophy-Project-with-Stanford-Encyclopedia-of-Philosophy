    "main_text": "Investigations into the Material A priori || Claims and Obligations\n3.4 Claims and Obligations\n\n\nReinach's major work, \u201cThe A priori Foundations\nof the Civil Law\u201d (1913) begins with the following claim:\n\n\nInsofar as philosophy is ontology or the a priori theory of\nobjects, it has to do with the analysis of all possible kinds of\nobjects as such. We shall see that philosophy here comes across objects\nof quite a new kind, objects which do not belong to nature in the\nproper sense, which are neither physical nor psychical and which are at\nthe same time different from all ideal objects in virtue of their\ntemporality. (p. 6)\n\n\nReinach here refers specifically to claims and obligations. He\nasserts that they exist just as much as do trees and houses. Clearly,\nthey are not physical entities, but neither are they mental. They do\nindeed presuppose a person as their \u201cbearer\u201d\u2014that is,\nreal claims and obligations always belong to someone. In addition,\npsychological properties may correspond to claims and obligations; for\nexample, one may feel entitled or feel obligated. However, if\nI accept a car loan and contractually agree to pay back the loan over a\n36-month period, my obligation does not cease to exist even if such\nfeelings fade away and even if I forget about the obligation\ncompletely. The very fact that a claim or obligation may last for years\nwithout change speaks against any alleged reduction to something\npsychological, for there is nothing in the psychological (or indeed in\nthe physical) domain that remains static over time.\n",
