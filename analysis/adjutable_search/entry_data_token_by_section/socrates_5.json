A Chronology of the historical Socrates in the context of Athenian history and the dramatic dates of Plato\u2019s dialogues\n\nThe larger column on the left below provides some of the biographical\ninformation from ancient sources with the dramatic dates of\nPlato\u2019s dialogues interspersed [in boldface]\nthroughout. In the smaller column on the right are dates of major\nevents and persons familiar from fifth century Athenian history.\nAlthough the dates are as precise as allowed by the facts, some are\nestimated and controversial (Nails 2002).\n\n\n\nWhen Socrates was born in 469, a Persian invasion\nhad been decisively repulsed at Plataea, and the Delian League that\nwould grow into the Athenian empire had already been formed. Attica\ncomprised 139 political districts (demes), assigned variously to\nAthens\u2019s ten tribes; regardless of how far from the walled urban\ncenter a deme might be, its registered members were Athenian.\n\n\nSocrates\u2019s tribe was Antiochis, and his deme was Alopece\n(south-southeast of the city wall). Assuming that his stoneworker\nfather, Sophroniscus, kept to the conventions, he carried the infant\naround the hearth, thereby formally admitting him into the family,\nfive days after he was born, named him on the tenth day, presented him\nto his phratry (a regional hereditary association) and took\nresponsibility for socializing him into the various institutions\nproper to an Athenian male. Literacy had become widespread among males\nsince about 520, and there were a number of elementary schools\nteaching boys to read and write, along with the traditional gymnastics\nand music, by the 480s (Harris 1989, 55), so we can be confident that\nSocrates received a formal education and that Plato was not\nexaggerating when he described the young Socrates as eagerly acquiring\nthe philosopher Anaxagoras\u2019s books (scrolls, to be more precise,\nPhaedo 98b). \n \n469 tragedies of Aeschylus, poetry\nof Pindar prominent\n\n462 democratic judicial reform of the Areopagus\n\n459 Athens\u2019s long walls to the Piraeus port\nbegun\n\n450s Athens extends empire, introduces democratic\nreforms (archonship opened to third citizen class, pay for jurors\ninstituted, citizenship restricted) \n\nIn Socrates\u2019s eighteenth year, Sophroniscus presented him\nto the deme in a ceremony called dokimasia. He was there\nexamined and entered onto the citizens\u2019 roll, making him\neligible\u2014subject to age or class restrictions\u2014for the many\ntasks of government determined by lot or required of all citizens,\nbeginning with two years of compulsory training in the Athenian\nmilitia. In an important sense, the dokimasia marked a young\nman\u2019s allegiance to the laws of Athens. Sophroniscus died soon\nafter Socrates came of age, making him his mother\u2019s legal\nguardian. Socrates\u2019s mother, Phaenarete, later remarried and had\na second son, Patrocles (Plato, Euthydemus 297e); she became\na midwife sometime thereafter (Plato, Theaetetus149a).\n\n\nAthens was a city of numerous festivals, competitions, and\ncelebrations, including the Panathenaea that attracted visitors to the\ncity from throughout the Mediterranean. Like the Olympics, the\nPanathenaea was celebrated with special splendor at four-year\nintervals. [450 Parmenides] Plato depicts\nthe nineteen-year-old Socrates in conversation with the great visiting\nphilosophers from Elea, Parmenides and Zeno, at one of the Greater\nPanathenaea festivals, in late July or early August of 450. \n \n450\u2013430 \u201cGolden Age of\nPericles\u201d: construction on the Athenian acropolis, led by\nPhidias, Polyclitus; tragedy dominated by Sophocles and Euripides;\nnatural philosophy, rhetoric, and sophistry thrive in atmosphere of\nrelative affluence and freedom \n\nAfter completing his two years of military training, Socrates\nwas subject to being sent beyond the borders of Attica with the army,\nbut these were years of relative peace, so he is likely to have\npracticed a trade, at least until he gave his mother in marriage to\nChaeredemus. Only at the age of thirty was eligibility reached for\nsuch responsibilities and offices as jury service, generalship, and\nCouncil (executive body for the sovereign Assembly), so Athenian men\nlived at home with their parents during those ten years,\nand\u2014depending on their class in Athens\u2019s rigid four-class\nsystem, based on wealth and birth\u2014they spent that period\nlearning a trade or acquiring the skills in public speaking and\npersuasion that would serve them well in Athens\u2019s citizen\nAssembly and courts. [433/2 Protagoras] When\nPlato next writes of Socrates, he is attending Callias\u2019s\n\u201copen house\u201d where famous educators of the day\n(Protagoras, Prodicus, Hippias) are vying for the lucrative\nopportunity to teach the wealthiest and most prominent young men of\nthe city.\n \n448 Spartan invasion\n\n446 defeat at Coronea, loss of Boeotia, Spartan\ninvasion\n\n446/5 Thirty Years\u2019 Peace signed with Sparta\n\n442 comedy added to the Lenaean festival\n\n433 Protagoras in Athens \n\nAthens was even then, however, sliding toward war with Sparta on\na scale that would involve all of Greece over the next three decades.\nTwo of Plato\u2019s longer dialogues are set loosely throughout the\nwar. [431\u2013404 Republic, Gorgias] Both\nSocrates and Alcibiades were posted that summer, 432, to Potidaea to\nput down a revolt, Socrates as a footsoldier (hoplite). After\nan initial battle, a long siege reduced the population to cannibalism\nbefore it surrendered (Thucydides 2.70.1). As the army made its way\nhome, it engaged in battle near Spartolus and suffered heavy losses\n(Thucydides 2.79.1\u20137). Socrates distinguished himself there by\nsaving the life and armor of the wounded Alcibiades (Plato,\nSymposium 220d\u2013e). When the army finally returned to\nAthens in May of 429, nearly three years had elapsed since its\ndeployment. Soon after his return, Socrates was accused by a comic\nplaywright of helping Euripides to write his tragedies, a claim that\nwas to be repeated at least twice more, by other comedy writers, on\nthe Athenian stage. Plato illustrates Socrates\u2019s arrival and\nreturn to conversation in the Charmides [429\nCharmides], where\nparticipants (including Plato\u2019s relatives Critias and Charmides)\ndiscuss moderation.\n \n432 revolt at Potidaea\n\n431 Peloponnesian War begins\n\n430 outbreak of plague\n\n429 death of Pericles\n\n427 Gorgias in Athens\n\n425 Spartan peace offer refused \n\nSocrates\u2019s active duty continued at the battle of Delium\nin 424, under the command of Laches. This was another defeat for the\nAthenian army which, while already under attack from Boeotian\nfootsoldiers, was surprised by a troop of cavalry. Socrates\u2019s\nheroic behavior in the retreat is praised by Laches (Laches\n181b) the following winter, and later by Alcibiades (Plato,\nSymposium 221a). [424 Laches] The\nLaches, on the nature of courage, shows Socrates as a friend\nof the famous Athenian general Nicias and makes a point of\nSocrates\u2019s being a favorite of the city\u2019s youths while\nremaining unknown to most of his fellow citizens. Any anonymity\nSocrates may have enjoyed came to an abrupt end at the annual\nDionysian festival in the spring of 423. In the comedy category, at\nleast two of the plays involved Socrates: one had the title of\nSocrates\u2019s music teacher, Connus; the other was\nAristophanes\u2019s Clouds (\u00a72.1).\n \n424 battle of Delium\n\n424/3 birth of Plato\n\n423 one-year truce with Sparta; Aristophanes,\nClouds \n\nA year later, Socrates fought at Amphipolis, another Athenian\ndisaster following another surprise attack. Socrates, so far as we\nknow, did not return to war again. Athens and Sparta entered into a\ntreaty named for Nicias that\u2014while never completely\neffective\u2014allowed Attica to remain free of Spartan invasion and\ncrop-burnings for several years. During the peace, Socrates is\nrepresented as carrying on with his dialectical conversations with\nAthenians, concentrating on the nature of erotic love\n[418\u2013416 Phaedrus], especially in\nrelation to the education in rhetoric that had been especially popular\nin Athens since Gorgias\u2019s visit in 427. Plato\u2019s\nSymposium also focuses on erotic love, bringing together in\nFebruary of 416 renowned Athenians\u2014Socrates, the tragedian\nAgathon, the comedian Aristophanes, the general Alcibiades, a doctor,\nan orator, an unknown follower of Socrates, and Agathon\u2019s older\nlover\u2014who give speeches in praise of love [416\nSymposium]. Again education is a central theme, but\nso are the democracy and Eleusinian Mystery religion. In fact, at\nleast half the persons who celebrated Agathon\u2019s victory in the\ntragedy competition were implicated in acts of\nsacrilege\u2014profanations of the Eleusinian\nMysteries\u2014presaged in the dialogue, that were said to have taken\nplace in the months following the symposium but that had not been\nreported to the authorities until much later.\n \n422 battle of Amphipolis\n\n421 \u201cPeace of Nicias\u201d declared\n\n416 subjugation of Melos \n\nIt was at about this time that Socrates married Xanthippe. From\nthe fact that they named their first son Lamprocles, it has been\nassumed both that her father was named Lamprocles and that her dowry\nwas enough to provide for her needs. Their second son would be named\nSophroniscus for Socrates\u2019s father.\n \n  \n\nMeanwhile, Alcibiades persuaded the Assembly, over prescient\nobjections from Nicias (Thucydides 6.9\u201314), that Athens should\ninvade Sicily. Both Nicias and Alcibiades, along with Lamachus, were\nelected to command. When the ships had been supplied and were on the\nverge of sailing, almost all the city\u2019s boundary markers, called\nherms, statues of the face and phallus of the god Hermes,\nwere mutilated in a single night. Since Hermes was the god of travel,\nthe city feared a conspiracy against the democracy. A commission was\nformed to investigate not only the herm-smashing, but all crimes of\nirreverence (asebeia) that could be discovered, offering\nrewards for information. In a climate of near-hysteria over three\nmonths, accusations led to executions (including summary executions),\nexile, torture, and imprisonment affecting hundreds of people, some of\nwhom were close to Socrates (Alcibiades, Charmides, Critias,\nEryximachus, Phaedrus, and others). The actual herm-mutilators turned\nout to be a young men\u2019s drinking club, and some of the accusers\nultimately admitted to lying; although death penalties that has been\nimposed in absentia were rescinded, nothing could bring back\nthe innocent dead.\n \n415 preparations to invade Sicily;\nherm mutilations; fleet embarks; commission receives evidence\n\n414 Alcibiades recalled for trial, defects to Sparta;\nsiege of Syracuse; death of Lamachus\n\n414 (winter) Sparta reenters the war, following\nAlcibiades\u2019s advice, takes and fortifies the deme of Decelea,\nencouraging Athenian slaves to escape \n\nAs the Sicilian invasion foundered, Nicias, in sole command\nwhile gravely ill with kidney disease, sent a letter to the Athenians\nsaying the army was under siege and should be called back or\nreinforced; he asked to be relieved of his command (Thucydides\n7.11\u201315). He was not relieved, but reinforcements were\nsent\u2014too few, too late. The war in Sicily ended in complete and\nhumiliating defeat. Spring brought a new attack on Socrates by\nAristophanes (Birds, lines 1280\u20133, 1553\u20135). Plato\nsets a dialogue between Socrates and a rhapsode before the news of the\ndefeat reached Athens [413 Ion], while the\ncity\u2014short of military leaders\u2014was trying to attract\nforeign generals to help with the war.\n \n413 reinforcements arrive in\nSicily; army annihilated, some enslaved; execution of Nicias\n\n\nThe next few years were chaotic in Athens as the empire shrank\nfrom revolts, and former allies refused to pay extortion/tribute any\nlonger. The treasury was spent, and the citizenry demoralized. The\ndemocracy was overthrown in a revolution of \u201cthe Four\nHundred\u201d followed by a government of \u201cthe Five\nThousand.\u201d What was left of the army, however, was loyal to the\ndemocracy and persuaded Alcibiades to return to his former command.\nUnder his leadership, Athens began scoring victories, and morale\nimproved. Democracy was restored, peace offers from Sparta were again\nrebuffed, and Athens established a commission to rewrite all the\nexisting laws.\n \n412 subject-allies revolt against\nAthens\n\n411 oligarchic revolution; Alcibiades returns to\ncommand\n\n410 restoration of democracy; peace with Sparta\nrefused; legal reforms begun \n\nA wrestling school, newly erected, is the setting for Socrates\nto examine the nature of friendship with a group of adolescents\n[409 Lysis] who were agemates of Plato and\nhis older brothers. One of the Lysis characters, Ctesippus,\nwas present again two years later for a display by two sophists\n(former generals) [407 Euthydemus].\n \n407 Alcibiades in Athens; battle\nof Notium lost, Alcibiades dismissed \n\nAthens was meanwhile pursuing the war with Sparta by sea. Athens\nwon the sea battle of Arginusae, but at such cost that the city never\nrecovered: in barest outline, what happened was this. Two of\nAthens\u2019s board of ten generals were under siege at Mytilene, so\nthe other eight commanded the battle. With thousands dead, and damage\nto the fleet, two captains were sent to collect the casualties; a\nstorm prevented their doing so, while the generals hastened to give\nrelief at Mytilene. When news of the battle hit Athens, there was\noutrage at the failure to save the wounded and collect the corpses for\nburial. The board of ten generals was charged, but two fled (and two\nwere still in Mytilene), so six returned to Athens for trial in\nOctober of 406 (Lang 1990). By luck of the lottery, Socrates was\nserving on the Prytanes, the presiding committee of Council (Plato,\nApology 32b; Xenophon, Hellenica 1.7.15) when the\ntrial took place, not in a court before a jury but before the whole\nAssembly.\n \n406 battle of Arginusae; trial and\nexecution of the generals; deaths of Euripides and Sophocles\n\n\nThe generals were being tried for a capital crime in one\nday\u2014a flaw in the Athenian legal code that Socrates would later\ncriticize (Plato, Apology 37a\u2013b)\u2014but, even worse,\nthey were being tried as a group, in direct violation of the Athenian\nlaw of Cannonus requiring each defendant in a capital crime to receive\na separate trial. Some in the Assembly opposed the illegality, but the\nopposition so incensed the majority that it overwhelmingly approved a\nmotion to subject the opposition to the same vote as would decide the\nfate of the generals. At that point, several of the fifty members of\nthe Prytanes refused to put the question, so the generals\u2019\naccusers roused the crowd to greater anger. Socrates alone among the\nPrytanes was left standing for the law and the generals; his refusal\nto allow the vote had the effect of allowing one last, eloquent speech\nfrom the floor that proposed a preliminary vote to decide between\nsentencing the group and permitting separate trials (Xenophon,\nHellenica 1.7.16\u201333). The Assembly approved separate\ntrials, but a parliamentary maneuver invalidated the vote. When the\nAssembly voted again, it was to decide the lives of the generals up or\ndown. All were condemned. The Athenians were soon to regret having\nexecuted their remaining military leaders.\n \n  \n\nThe following spring, Aristophanes again attacked Socrates, this\ntime declaring that it was no longer fashionable to associate with\nSocrates who, with his \u201chairsplitting twaddle,\u201d ignored\nthe craft of the tragedians (Frogs, lines\n1491\u201399).\n \n405 battle of Aegospotami; siege\nof Athens \n\nThe next naval battle, Aegospotami, was cataclysmic and was\nfollowed by the Spartan siege of Athens. The Athenians, recalling\ntheir own treatment of the Melians, expected to be slaughtered when\nthe siege inevitably ended, but nothing of the sort occurred. When the\nSpartans entered Athens, they required that the defensive long walls\nbe demolished, and they directed that the Athenians elect a government\nthat would reinstitute the city\u2019s ancestral constitution to\nprevent the excesses of the democratic Assembly. The\nauthority of the government that was subsequently elected,\nperhaps three per tribe\u2014\u201cthe Thirty\u201d\u2014lies at\nthe root of any discussion of whether Socrates committed what would\nnow be called civil disobedience when he disobeyed their order (Plato,\nApology 32c\u2013e). None of the contemporaneous sources, no\nmatter how hostile to the rule of the Thirty\u2014Isocrates, Lysias,\nPlato, and Xenophon\u2014denies the legitimacy of their election.\nThat they formed a government that abused and exceeded its authority\nno one could reasonably deny, but it is against just such governments\nthat acts of civil disobedience must sometimes be directed.\nUndermining a corrupt government by refusing to harm a good man might\nbe unlawful, but not unjust.\n \n404 legal reforms begun in 410\ncompleted; board appointed to add new laws, assisted by Council; death\nof Alcibiades; Spartans enter the city under Lysander; long walls\ndemolished; \u201cthe Thirty\u201d elected; seizures and executions;\nroll of \u201cthe Three Thousand\u201d; death of Theramenes;\ndemocratic exodus to Phyle \n\nThe Thirty moved quickly after the election to consolidate power\nby calling for Spartan aid, seizing the property of wealthy Athenians\nand foreign residents, many of whom they executed (including\nLysias\u2019s brother, Polemarchus; and Nicias\u2019s son,\nNiceratus\u2014associates of Socrates). Critias and Charicles, two\nleaders of the Thirty, sought to intimidate Socrates by forbidding\nhim, unsuccessfully, to speak to men under thirty (Xenophon,\nMemorabilia 1.2.35). As the scope of the government\u2019s\nexecutions widened to include detractors, and a select citizen roll of\n3,000 was named, and all others disarmed, a moderate member of the\nThirty, Theramenes, objected to the wanton killings and found himself\ntaken captive at Critias\u2019s instigation. Socrates, and two young\nmen with him, were said to have attempted to intervene unarmed against\nthe Scythian guards, stopped only when Theramenes himself implored\nthem to desist (Diodorus Siculus 14.5.1\u20133, likely apocryphal).\nAfter Theramenes\u2019s execution, many citizens left the walled\ncity: some regrouped in the distant and mountainous deme of Phyle,\nplanning to topple the Thirty (among them was Socrates\u2019s\nchildhood friend, Chaerephon); others went only as far as the Piraeus\nwhere \u201cthe Ten\u201d (including Charmides) chosen by the Thirty\nwere less effective at suppression than the Thirty themselves.\n \n  \n\nThe Thirty, now increasingly viewed as tyrannical, were also\nmaking contingency plans: they sent forces to secure the deme of\nEleusis for themselves by putting to death the population on charges\nof supporting democracy (Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.8\u201310;\nDiodorus Siculus 14.32.5). Socrates remained in the city. The Thirty\nattempted to implicate him in their executions by ordering him to join\nothers in going to Salamis to fetch the former democratic general,\nLeon. It was Socrates\u2019s refusal to obey this order that has\ncontroversially been called an act of civil disobedience. Luckily for\nSocrates, before the Thirty could exact revenge, the democrats from\nPhyle entered the city through the Piraeus and met the forces of the\nThirty in a battle where both Critias and Charmides were killed.\nRemnants of the Thirty returned to the city to consider their options.\nThe Three Thousand, increasingly suspicious of one another, deposed\nthe Thirty and replaced them with a Board of Ten that was elected one\nper tribe (Xenophon, Hellenica 2.4.23). The Thirty began\nabandoning the city for Eleusis as the board called for Spartan help.\nThe Spartans arrived, led by Lysander and by one of their two kings,\nPausanias. Pausanias especially attempted to effect reconciliation\namong all the Athenian factions, allowing the exiles to return and the\noligarchs to rule themselves in Eleusis. One such exile was Anytus, a\nman hostile to Socrates and who would later support charges of\nirreverence against him. [402 Meno]. As soon\nas the Spartans\u2019 backs were turned, the restored democrats\nraided Eleusis and killed the remaining oligarchic supporters,\nsuspecting them of hiring mercenaries. [winter 401/0\nMenexenus]\n \n403 battle of Munychia; Board of\nTen takes charge, calls for Spartan aid; Spartans arrive;\nreconciliation talks begin; exiles return\n\n403/2 new legal era proclaimed; new religious\ncalendar adopted; Sparta encourages reconciliation among Athenian\nfactions\n\n402\u2013400 Spartan war with Elis\n\n401 remaining oligarchs killed; Xenophon leaves\nAthens\n\n400 conflict shifts to the courts  \n\n\nThis brings us to the spring and summer of 399, to Socrates\u2019s\ntrial and execution. Twice in Plato\u2019s dialogues\n(Symposium 173b, Theaetetus 142c\u2013143a),\nfact-checking with Socrates took place as his friends sought to commit\nhis conversations to writing before he was executed. [spring\n399 Theaetetus] Prior to the action in the\nTheaetetus, a young poet named Meletus had composed a\ndocument charging Socrates with the capital crime of irreverence\n(asebeia): failure to show due piety toward the gods of\nAthens. This he delivered to Socrates in the presence of witnesses,\ninstructing Socrates to present himself before the king archon within\nfour days for a preliminary hearing (the same magistrate would later\npreside at the pre-trial examination and the trial). At the end of the\nTheaetetus, Socrates was on his way to that preliminary\nhearing. As a citizen, he had the right to countersue, the right to\nforgo the hearing, allowing the suit to proceed uncontested, and the\nright to exile himself voluntarily, as the personified laws later\nremind him (Crito 52c). Socrates availed himself of none of\nthese rights of citizenship. Rather, he set out to enter a plea and\nstopped at a gymnasium to talk to some youngsters about mathematics\nand knowledge.\n\nWhen he arrived at the king archon\u2019s stoa, Socrates fell into a\nconversation about reverence with a diviner he knew, Euthyphro\n[399 Euthyphro], and afterwards answered\nMeletus\u2019s charge. This preliminary hearing designated the\nofficial receipt of the case and was intended to lead to greater\nprecision in the formulation of the charge. In Athens, religion was a\nmatter of public participation under law, regulated by a calendar of\nreligious festivals; and the city used revenues to maintain temples\nand shrines. Socrates\u2019s irreverence, Meletus claimed, had\nresulted in the corruption of the city\u2019s young men\n(Euthyphro 3c\u2013d). Evidence for irreverence was of two\ntypes: Socrates did not believe in the gods of the Athenians (indeed,\nhe had said on many occasions that the gods do not lie or do other\nwicked things, whereas the Olympian gods of the poets and the city\nwere quarrelsome and vindictive); Socrates introduced new divinities\n(indeed, he insisted that his daimonion had spoken to him\nsince childhood). Meletus handed over his complaint, and Socrates\nentered his plea. The king-archon could refuse Meletus\u2019s case on\nprocedural grounds, redirect the complaint to an arbitrator, or accept\nit; he accepted it. Socrates had the right to challenge the\nadmissibility of the accusation in relation to existing law, but he\ndid not, so the charge was published on whitened tablets in the agora\nand a date was set for the pre-trial examination\u2014but not before\nSocrates fell into another conversation, this one on the origins of\nwords (Smith 2022). [399 Cratylus] From this\npoint, word spread rapidly, probably accounting for the spike of\ninterest in Socratic conversations recorded in Theaetetus and\nSymposium. [399 Symposium frame]\nBut Socrates nevertheless is shown by Plato spending the next day in\ntwo very long conversations promised in Theaetetus (210d).\n[399 Sophist, Statesman]\n\nAt the pre-trial examination, Meletus paid no court fees because it\nwas considered a public duty to prosecute irreverence. To discourage\nfrivolous suits, however, Athenian law imposed a heavy fine on\nplaintiffs who failed to obtain at least one fifth of the jury\u2019s\nvotes, as Socrates later points out (Apology 36a\u2013b).\nUnlike closely timed jury trials, pre-trial examinations encouraged\nquestions to and by the litigants, to make the legal issues more\nprecise. This procedure had become essential because of the\nsusceptibility of juries to bribery and misrepresentation. Originally\nintended to be a microcosm of the citizen body, juries by\nSocrates\u2019s time were manned by elderly, disabled, and\nimpoverished volunteers who needed the meager three-obol pay.\n\nIn the month of Thargelion [May-June 399\nApology] a month or two after Meletus\u2019s\ninitial summons, Socrates\u2019s trial occurred. On the day before,\nthe Athenians had launched a ship to Delos, dedicated to Apollo and\ncommemorating Theseus\u2019s legendary victory over the Minotaur\n(Phaedo 58a\u2013b). Spectators gathered along with the jury\n(Apology 25a) for a trial that probably lasted most of the\nday, each side timed by the water clock. Plato does not provide\nMeletus\u2019s prosecutorial speech or those of Anytus and Lycon, who\nhad joined in the suit; or the names of witnesses, if any\n(Apology 34a implies Meletus called none).\nApology\u2014the Greek \u2018apologia\u2019 means\n\u2018defense\u2019\u2014is not edited as are the court speeches of\norators. For example, there are no indications in the Greek text (at\n35d and 38b) that the two votes were taken; and there are no breaks\n(at 21a or 34b) for witnesses who may have been called. Also missing\nare speeches by Socrates\u2019s supporters; it is improbable that he\nhad none, even though Plato does not name them.\n\nSocrates, in his defense, mentioned the harm done to him by\nAristophanes\u2019s Clouds (\u00a72.1). Though Socrates\ndenied outright that he studied the heavens and what is below the\nearth, his familiarity with the investigations of natural philosophers\nand his own naturalistic explanations of such phenomena as earthquakes\nand eclipses make it no surprise that the jury remained unpersuaded.\nAnd, seeing Socrates out-argue Meletus, the jury probably did not make\nfine distinctions between philosophy and sophistry. Socrates three\ntimes took up the charge that he corrupted the young, insisting that,\nif he corrupted them, he did so unwillingly; but if unwillingly, he\nshould be instructed, not prosecuted (Apology 25e\u201326a).\nThe jury found him guilty. By his own argument, however, Socrates\ncould not blame the jury, for it was mistaken about what was truly in\nthe interest of the city (cf. Theaetetus 177d\u2013e) and\nthus required instruction.\n\nIn the penalty phase of the trial, Socrates said, \u201cIf it were\nthe law with us, as it is elsewhere, that a trial for life should not\nlast one but many days, you would be convinced, but now it is not easy\nto dispel great slanders in a short time\u201d (Apology\n37a\u2013b). This isolated complaint stands opposed to the remark of\nthe personified laws that Socrates was \u201cwronged not by us, the\nlaws, but by men\u201d (Crito 54c). It had been a crime\nsince 403/2 for anyone even to propose a law or decree in conflict\nwith the newly inscribed laws, so it was ironic for the laws to tell\nSocrates to persuade or obey them (Crito 51b\u2013c). In a\nlast-minute capitulation to his friends, he offered to allow them to\npay a fine of six times his net worth (Xenophon Oeconomicus\n2.3.4\u20135), thirty minae. The jury rejected the proposal.\nPerhaps the jury was too incensed by Socrates\u2019s words to vote\nfor the lesser penalty; after all, he needed to tell them more than\nonce to stop interrupting him. It is more likely, however, that\nsuperstitious jurors were afraid that the gods would be angry if they\nfailed to execute a man already found guilty of irreverence. Sentenced\nto death, Socrates reflected that it might be a blessing: either a\ndreamless sleep, or an opportunity to converse in the underworld.\n\nWhile the sacred ship was on its journey to Delos, no executions were\nallowed in the city. Although the duration of the annual voyage varied\nwith conditions, Xenophon says it took thirty-one days in 399\n(Memorabilia 4.8.2); if so, Socrates lived thirty days beyond\nhis trial, into the month of Skirophorion. A day or two before the\nend, Socrates\u2019s childhood friend Crito tried to persuade\nSocrates to escape. [June\u2013July 399\nCrito] Socrates replied that he \u201clistens to\nnothing \u2026 but the argument that on reflection seems best\u201d\nand that \u201cneither to do wrong or to return a wrong is ever\nright, not even to injure in return for an injury received\u201d\n(Crito 46b, 49d), not even under threat of death (cf.\nApology 32a), not even for one\u2019s family (Crito\n54b). Socrates could not point to a harm that would outweigh the harm\nhe would be inflicting on the city if he now exiled himself unlawfully\nwhen he could earlier have done so lawfully (Crito 52c); such\nlawbreaking would have confirmed the jury\u2019s judgment that he was\na corrupter of the young (Crito 53b\u2013c) and brought\nshame on his family and friends.\n\nThe events of Socrates\u2019s last day, when he \u201cappeared happy\nboth in manner and words as he died nobly and without fear\u201d\n(Phaedo 58e) were related by Phaedo to the Pythagorean\ncommunity at Phlius some weeks or months after the execution.\n[June\u2013July 399 Phaedo] The Eleven,\nprison officials chosen by lot, met with Socrates at dawn to tell him\nwhat to expect (Phaedo 59e\u201360b). When Socrates\u2019s\nfriends arrived, Xanthippe and their youngest child, Menexenus, were\nstill with him. Xanthippe commiserated with Socrates that he was about\nto enjoy his last conversation with his companions; then, performing\nthe ritual lamentation expected of women, was led home. Socrates spent\nthe day in philosophical conversation, defending the soul\u2019s\nimmortality and warning his companions not to restrain themselves in\nargument, \u201cIf you take my advice, you will give but little\nthought to Socrates but much more to the truth. If you think that what\nI say is true, agree with me; if not, oppose it with every\nargument\u201d (Phaedo 91b\u2013c). On the other hand, he\nwarned them sternly to restrain their emotions, \u201ckeep quiet and\ncontrol yourselves\u201d (Phaedo 117e).\n\nSocrates had no interest in whether his corpse was burned or buried,\nbut he bathed at the prison\u2019s cistern so the women of his\nhousehold would be spared from having to wash his corpse. After\nmeeting with his family again in the late afternoon, he rejoined his\ncompanions. The servant of the Eleven, a public slave, bade Socrates\nfarewell by calling him \u201cthe noblest, the gentlest, and the\nbest\u201d of men (Phaedo 116c). The poisoner described the\nphysical effects of the Conium maculatum variety of hemlock\nused for citizen executions (Bloch 2001), then Socrates cheerfully\ntook the cup and drank. Phaedo, a former slave echoing the slave of\nthe Eleven, called Socrates, \u201cthe best, \u2026 the wisest and\nthe most upright\u201d (Phaedo 118a).\n",
