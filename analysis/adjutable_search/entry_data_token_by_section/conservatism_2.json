It advocates piecemeal, moderate reform, which\nfollows from its scepticism concerning reason, and its valuing of\nexperience concerning human affairs. Burke argued that \u201ca state\nwithout the means of some change is without the means of its\nconservation\u201d. But change must be cautious, because knowledge is\nimperfect and consequences can be unintended. According to\nconservatives, institutions and morals evolve, their weaknesses become\napparent and obvious political abuses are corrected; but ancient\ninstitutions embody a tacit wisdom that deserves respect.\nConservatives are sceptical of large-scale constitutional, economic or\ncultural planning, because behaviour and institutions have evolved\nthrough the wisdom of generations, which cannot easily be\narticulated.\n\nCentral to conservatism is the notion of tradition, whose\nself-conscious, contrastive use arises only in modernity. In the later\n18th century, the mobilisation of \u201cthe past\u201d as\nan explicit political resource became especially important, and a\ncontrast between \u201ctraditional\u201d and\n\u201cmodern\u201d\u2014as opposed to \u201cancient\u201d and\n\u201cmodern\u201d\u2014was stressed. Burke\u2019s political\nphilosophy was an early instance of this process. This mobilisation\nhas been associated with \u201cthe invention of tradition\u201d\n(Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983), in which mass-produced\n\u201ctraditional\u201d artefacts established a fictional organic\nrelation between past and present, as in Sir Walter Scott\u2019s\nre-invention of the kilt and other \u201ctraditional\u201d artefacts\nfor King George IV\u2019s visit to Edinburgh in 1822.\n\nFor conservatives, vital political relations are organic. Unlike\nreactionary thinkers, they regard traditions not as static, but as in\na gentle and gradual flux, encouraged by the astute reformer. For\nBurke, the English revolutionaries of 1688 achieved restoration as\nopposed to \u201cinnovation\u201d. Reform corrects the inadequacies\nof ancient institutions in light of contemporary\nneeds\u2014conservatives such as Disraeli might want to create a\nbroader suffrage, for instance\u2014but one must disdain \u201cthe\nblind and furious spirit of innovation\u201d. Reform must be\npractically and not theoretically-based:\n\n\nI must see with my own eyes\u2026touch with my own hands not only\nthe fixed but the momentary circumstances, before I could venture to\nsuggest any political project whatsoever\u2026I must see the means\nof correcting the plan\u2026I must see the things; I must see the\nmen. (Burke, WS III: 326)\n\n\nFor Kekes, conservatism adopts a stance of scepticism between extremes\nof rationalism and fideism (belief based on faith), and steers a\nmiddle course of pessimism between claims of perfectibility and\ncorruptibility (1998: 54, 89, 60). Conservatives aim to\n\n\nconserve the political arrangements that have historically shown\nthemselves to be conducive to good lives thus understood (1998:\n27);\n\n\nthey regard\n\n\nhistory [as] the best guide to understanding the present and planning\nfor the future. (Kekes 1997: 352)\n\n\nConservatism\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d social vision is inherently\nsceptical of the state, and puts faith instead in the family, private\nproperty and religion; it does not involve the rich organicism of the\nBritish Idealists Bradley and Bosanquet, that yields \u201ca mystical\nunion with the superior unity of the state\u201d\u2014a German\nphilosophical rather than British conservative conception (Sweet\n1999). As Cobban writes, Locke\u2019s influence ensured that the\n\u201chistoric idea in Burke\u2019s mind [did not] pass into the\nfull organic theory of society\u201d (Cobban 1960: 89). It is\nreaction and not conservatism that is inherently authoritarian. For\nconservatives, individuals and local communities are better assessors\nof their own needs and problems than distant bureaucrats. Free from\nutopian planning, conservatives hold, society finds its own, largely\nbeneficial, shape.\n\nConservatism proceeds via the tried and tested, relying not on pure\nreason, but on what Burke called the \u201clatent wisdom\u201d of\nprejudice, instinct and custom, which accumulates across generations.\nFor Kirk, \u201cprejudice is not bigotry or superstition\u201d,\nthough it may degenerate into these; it is\n\n\npre-judgment, the answer\u2026which intuition and ancestral\nconsensus of opinion supply\u2026when [one] lacks either time or\nknowledge to arrive at a decision predicated upon pure reason. (1954:\n34)\n\n\nFor conservatives, custom is immemorial but not thereby static; it is\n\u201cconstantly being subjected to the test of experience\u201d\n(Pocock 1989: 213). But to change the state in response to\n\u201cfloating fancies or fashions\u201d is to break the\n\u201cwhole chain and continuity of the commonwealth\u201d (Burke,\nWS III: 145). \n",
