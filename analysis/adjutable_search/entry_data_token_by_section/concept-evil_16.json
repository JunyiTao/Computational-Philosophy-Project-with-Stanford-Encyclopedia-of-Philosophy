Contemporary Theories of Evil Character/Personhood\n\nThe terms \u2018evil personhood\u2019 and \u2018evil\ncharacter\u2019 are used interchangeably in the literature. This\nentry will follow this convention.\n\nExtant theories of evil personhood can be cross-listed as regularity\nor dispositional accounts on the one hand, and as action-based,\naffect-based, or motivation-based accounts on the other (aggregative\naccounts are also possible, however, it isn\u2019t clear that any\ntheorist currently holds an aggregative account [See Russell 2014,\n139\u2013153]). For example, John Kekes holds an action-based\nregularity account (Kekes 1990, 48; 1998, 217; 2005, 2), while Todd\nCalder holds a motive-based dispositional account (Calder 2009,\n22\u201327).\n\nAccording to regularity accounts, evil persons have evil-making\nproperties habitually, or on a regular basis. According to\ndispositional accounts, evil persons need never have evil-making\nproperties. It is sufficient to have a disposition to have evil-making\nproperties.\n\nAction-based accounts contend that evil-making properties are certain\nsorts of actions\u2014evil actions. Affect-based accounts contend\nthat evil-making properties are certain sorts of feelings\u2014evil\nfeelings. Motivation-based accounts contend that evil-making\nproperties are certain sorts of motivations\u2014evil desires.\n\nSome theorists argue for more than one sort of evil-making property.\nFor example, Luke Russell argues that both evil actions and evil\nfeelings are evil making properties (Russell 2014, 292), while Daniel\nHaybron argues that evil feelings and evil motivations are evil-making\nproperties (Haybron 2002b, 269).\n",
