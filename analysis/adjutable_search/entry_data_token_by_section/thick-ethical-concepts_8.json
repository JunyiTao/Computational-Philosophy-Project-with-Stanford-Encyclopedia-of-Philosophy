    "main_text": "The Location Question: How Are Thick Concepts Evaluative?\n4. The Location Question: How Are Thick Concepts Evaluative?\n\nBoth the debate about Separability and Inseparability and the putative\nbroader significance of the thick depend on assumptions about how\nthick terms are evaluative. While everyone agrees that thick terms are\nsomehow linguistically associated with evaluations, the crucial\nassumption of many of these arguments is that utterances involving\nthick terms (T-utterances, for short) are evaluative specifically as a\nmatter of the conditions that must hold for such utterances to express\ntrue propositions. If the extension of a thick term has a descriptive\nequivalent, then evaluation makes no difference to the\ntruth-conditions of the utterances involving that term. A natural\nexplanation of why an outsider who grasps the non-evaluative content\nof a thick term couldn\u2019t master the extension of a thick term\nwould be be that its truth-conditions include some evaluative\ncondition which the outsider doesn\u2019t grasp. And thick terms can\nchallenge a logical is-ought gap only if T-utterances have an\nevaluative truth-condition, since logical relations are relations\nbetween truth-conditions. Accordingly Inseparabilists and many\nSeparabilists take evaluation to contribute to semantic\ncontent\u2014the kind of meaning that determines the reference or\ntruth-conditions of sentences involving thick terms.\n\nThe view that the evaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances are\nconveyed by the same mechanism as semantic or truth-conditional\ncontent in general is, however, controversial. Utterances can\ncommunicate information that doesn\u2019t contribute to their\ntruth-conditions, and in\n section 4.2\n we\u2019ll see several ways they can do so, either in virtue of\nother linguistic conventions or conversational principles and\nmechanisms. If we use the label \u201csemantic\u201d narrowly to\nrefer only to truth-conditional properties of utterances, and use the\nlabel \u201cpragmatic\u201d broadly to cover the other ways for\nutterances to convey information, then the view that thick terms are\nglobally evaluative as a matter of the truth-conditions of\nT-utterances may be called the \u201cSemantic View\u201d and the\nviews according which thick terms convey global evaluation through\nsome other mechanism of information transfer may be called\n\u201cPragmatic Views\u201d. (To avoid confusion, also bear in mind\nthat \u201cpragmatic\u201d is often used more narrowly to refer only\nto features of utterances that are explained by conversational\nprinciples rather than linguistic conventions.)\n",
