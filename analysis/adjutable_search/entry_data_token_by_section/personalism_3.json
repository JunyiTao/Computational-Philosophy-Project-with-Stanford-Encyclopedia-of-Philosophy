    "main_text": "American personalism\n4. American personalism\n\n\nAmerican personalism, best known as represented by such figures as\nBorden Parker Bowne (1847\u20131910), George H. Howison\n(1834\u20131916), and Edgar Sheffield Brightman (1884\u20131953),\ntook a different tack from continental European personalism in that\ninstead of a reaction to idealism, it is often actually a form of\nidealism, wherein being is defined as personal consciousness. Howison\npreferred the term \u201cpersonal idealism.\u201d Contrary to\ntwentieth-century continental European personalism, American\npersonalism, in particular in its early representatives, is a direct\ncontinuation of the development of more or less personalistic\nphilosophy and theology in nineteenth-century Europe and its analysis\nand refutation of various impersonalistic forms of thought. The\nAmerican and the stricter personalist twentieth-century school in\nEurope agreed in taking the person as their point of departure for\nunderstanding the world and in referring all moral truth to the\nabsolute value of the person, but while the latter derived these\ninsights primarily from existentialism, phenomenology, and Thomism,\nthe American school, while in some respects adding to them and\ndeveloping them further, basically took them over from the European\n\u201cspeculative theists\u201d.\n\n\nBoston University was long considered the hub of American personalism,\nunder the auspices of philosophy professor Borden Parker Bowne.  Bowne\nwas a Methodist minister who had studied under Rudolf Hermann Lotze in\nGermany. Lotze, a student of the speculative theist Christian Hermann\nWeisse (1801\u201366) who assimilated much of the later\nSchelling\u2019s criticism of Hegel, sought, like the speculative\ntheists, to modify Hegelian idealism by maintaining that the real is\nalways concrete and individual, transforming Hegel\u2019s absolute\nidealism into a personal idealism. Adding elements also from recent\ntrends in psychology, Bowne developed a distinct and explicitly\npersonalist position, which assumed the character of a philosophical\nschool. His late book Personalism, published in 1908, is a\npopular summary of his philosophy which introduced the term\n\u2018personalism\u2019 into American philosophical and theological\ndiscourse.\n\n\nBowne gathered a group of talented disciples who carried on his work\nin a second generation. The most important among these were Edgar\nSheffield Brightman, Albert C. Knudson (1873\u20131953), Francis\nJ. McConnell (1871\u20131953), George Albert Coe (1861\u20131951),\nand Ralph T. Flewelling (1871\u20131960). While Howison had established\nthe personalist tradition at the University of California, Berkeley,\nFlewelling took personalism to the University of Southern California,\nwhich became the second important twentieth-century center of\npersonalist thought in the United States.  Flewelling also\nfounded The Personalist, the journal that would serve as the\nforum for American personalism. In 1915, he published Personalism\nand the Problems of Philosophy: An Appreciation of the Work of Borden\nParker Bowne. At Boston University, Brightman continued the\nstudies in personalism, in time holding the Borden Parker Bowne chair\nof philosophy, while Knudson, having first taught classes in the Old\nTestament, moved into personalist theology. Meanwhile Walter George\nMuelder (1907\u2013), professor of social ethics and Christian theology at\nBoston University and the University of Southern California, helped\nbridge the gap between the Bostonian and Californian schools, calling\nhis doctrine \u201cCommunitarian Personalism.\u201d\n\nThe Boston personalist school has continued to influence American\nculture, sometimes in unexpected ways. A third generation of American\npersonalists, represented by such figures as Peter A. Bertocci\n(1910\u20131989) and W. Gordon Allport of Harvard, a student of William\nStern, further developed the psychological dimension of\npersonalism. Martin Luther King studied under the personalists at\nBoston University, and credited the experience with shaping his\nworldview: \u201cI studied philosophy and theology at Boston\nUniversity under Edgar S. Brightman and L. Harold DeWolf\u2026It was\nmainly under these teachers that I studied Personalistic\nphilosophy \u2013 the theory that the clue to the meaning of ultimate\nreality is found in personality. This personal idealism remains today\nmy basic philosophical position. Personalism\u2019s insistence that only\npersonality \u2013 finite and infinite \u2013 is ultimately real\nstrengthened me in two convictions: it gave me metaphysical and\nphilosophical grounding for the idea of a personal God, and it gave me\na metaphysical basis for the dignity and worth of all human\npersonality.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note, however, that American personalism cannot be\nreduced to the Boston University school. It flourished also at Harvard\nUniversity. Not only is this where Howison came from, but the work of\nleading Harvard philosophers such as William James (1842\u20131910),\nJosiah Royce (1855\u20131916), William Ernest Hocking\n(1873\u20131966), and Charles Hartshorne (1897\u20132000) displays\nstrong personalist elements. All of them, with the sole exception of\nRoyce, even called themselves personalists. \n",
