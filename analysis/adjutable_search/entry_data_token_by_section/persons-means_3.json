    "main_text": "Sufficient Conditions for Using Others Merely as Means || End Sharing\n3.1 End Sharing\n\nOn the basis of Kant\u2019s remarks, we might claim that if another\ncannot \u201ccontain the end\u201d of an agent\u2019s action, that\nis, share the end the agent is pursuing in using her, then the agent\ntreats the other merely as a means. Two agents presumably share an end\njust in case they are both trying, or have chosen to try, to realize\nthis end. But what, precisely, does it mean to say that two agents\ncannot share an end? Returning to the example at hand, what\ndoes it mean to say that the promisee cannot share the\npromisor\u2019s end? From the outset, it is important to specify\nprecisely which of the promisor\u2019s ends the promisee cannot\nshare. It is presumably the promisor\u2019s end of getting money from\nthe promisee without ever paying it back. The promisor\u2019s\nultimate end might be one that the two can share (e.g., that\nof curing cancer). What sense of \u2018cannot\u2019 would be\nplausible to invoke in maintaining that a promisee cannot share a\nfalse promisor\u2019s end?\n3.1.1 Logical impossibility of end sharing\n\nAccording to one interpretation of Kant, the promisee cannot share the\npromisor\u2019s end in that it is logically impossible for him to do\nso (Hill 2002: 69\u201370). Suppose the promisor, a borrower, has the\nend of getting money from the promisee, a lender, without ever paying\nit back. At the time he makes a loan on the basis of this promise, the\nlender cannot himself share the end of the borrower\u2019s getting\nthe money from him without ever paying it back, goes this reading. If\nthe lender shared the borrower\u2019s end, then he would not really\nbe making a loan. For according to our practice, it belongs to the\nvery concept of making a loan, as opposed, say, to giving money away,\nthat one believe that what one disburses will be repaid.\n\nThis interpretation of the false promising case leads naturally to the\nview that a sufficient condition for an agent\u2019s treating another\nmerely as a means is that it is logically impossible for the other to\nshare the end the agent is pursuing in using her in some way. However,\nthis proposed sufficient condition might fail to register as treating\nothers merely as means paradigmatic cases of doing so (Kerstein 2009:\n167\u2013168). Take, for example, a loiterer who threatens an\ninnocent passerby with a gun in order to get $100. It would presumably\nbe good if a sufficient condition for treating another merely as a\nmeans yielded the conclusion that the loiterer is treating the\npasserby merely as a means; for he is mugging her, which, intuitively\nspeaking, seems to be a clear case of treating another merely as a\nmeans. One might question whether the proposed sufficient condition\ndoes this. Even highly unlikely events are logically possible. It is\nimprobable, but still logically possible, that the passerby shares the\nloiterer\u2019s end of his getting $100, one might argue. For\nexample, the passerby might aim to give $100 to the loiterer, but not\nrecognize him when he threatens her and so hands over her money to him\nas a result of his threat. If this possibility is realized, then the\naccount would not count the loiterer as treating the passerby merely\nas a means. One might also argue that in the case of the false\npromise, it is improbable, but still logically possible, that the\nlender loans money to a borrower (and thereby believes that it will be\nrepaid), all the while sharing the borrower\u2019s end that she get\nmoney from him (the lender) without paying it back. For example, the\nlender might believe that the borrower will pay him back, but share\nher end of her getting money from him without repaying it because he\nbelieves that if she does, she will bring about something he covets,\nnamely, the demise of her reputation. Some philosophers insist,\nhowever, that this sort of scenario is not logically possible; for in\norder to be making a loan to another, a person must not only believe\nthat his money will be repaid, but want and hope that it will be\n(Papadaki 2016: 78), they say. If these philosophers\u2019 views are\nplausible, the proposed sufficient condition in view would deem as\ninstances of treating others merely as means a range of actions many\nenvisage as such.\n3.1.2 Preventing the other from choosing to pursue one\u2019s end\n\nAccording to a different interpretation of Kant, another cannot share\nthe end an agent pursues in using him in some way if how the agent\nbehaves \u201cprevents [the other] from choosing whether to\ncontribute to the realization of that end or not\u201d (Korsgaard\n1996: 139). The lender in our example cannot share the\nborrower\u2019s end of getting money without ever repaying it; for\nthe borrower\u2019s false promise obscures his end and thus prevents\nthe lender from choosing whether to contribute to it.\n\nThis reading of possible end sharing might have implausible\nimplications when incorporated into a principle according to which a\nperson who uses another treats the other merely as a means if the\nother cannot share the end she is pursuing in using him (Kerstein\n2013: 63). Consider young men hiking in the Rocky Mountains for the\nfirst time who find themselves on a mountain in late afternoon without\nwater and unsure of the way down. To their relief, they spot another\nhiker, someone whom they saw park his car in the same area below. They\nfollow him, using his knowledge of the terrain to get down the\nmountain safely. The young men realize that they could, but choose not\nto, tell the hiker that they are following him. Out of embarrassment\nfor their dependence on him, they ensure that they remain undetected.\nThe way they act prevents the man from choosing whether to contribute\nto the realization of their end. According to the notion of possible\nend sharing we are here considering, we might have to embrace a view\nthat some find implausible: Since the hiker cannot share the young\nmen\u2019s end, they are treating him merely as a means and thereby\nacting wrongly. To avoid this implication, one might affirm the\nfollowing: a person cannot share the end an agent pursues in using him\nif the agent\u2019s behavior prevents the person from choosing\nwhether to contribute to the realization of that end and the person\nhas a right not to be prevented from making this choice (Papadaki\n2016: 80). If the hiker fails to have a right not to be prevented from\nchoosing whether to contribute to the young men getting safely down\nthe mountain, then they do not treat him merely as a means according\nto the amended account. Of course, this amendment invites questions as\nto when a person has such a right, as well as making the account of\ntreating others merely as means depend on an account of moral rights\nin a way that Korsgaard (or Kant) might not have intended.\n3.1.3 Practical irrationality\n\nThe allusion in the false promising passage to possible end sharing is\nsubject to a third interpretation: the promisee cannot share the\npromisor\u2019s end in that it would be practically irrational for\nher to do so. In typical cases, it would be irrational for the\npromisee to try to realize the end of making a loan that is never to\nbe repaid. This end\u2019s being brought about would prevent him from\nrealizing other ends he is pursuing, ends such as paying rent, buying\ngroceries, or simply getting his money back.\n\nThe notion of practical irrationality at work here seems implicit in\nthe Groundwork. Kant there (1785: 413\u2013418) introduces a\nprinciple that Thomas Hill, Jr. calls (1992: 17\u201337) \u201cthe\nhypothetical imperative\u201d: If you will an end, then you ought to\nwill the means to it that are necessary and in your power, or give up\nwilling the end. Willing an end presumably involves setting it and\nattempting to realize it. According to Kant, the hypothetical\nimperative is a principle of reason: all of us are rationally\ncompelled to conform to this principle. An agent would be violating\nthe hypothetical imperative and thus acting irrationally by willing an\nend yet, at the same time, willing another end, the attainment of\nwhich would, he is aware, make it impossible for him to take the\notherwise available and necessary means to his original end. An agent\nwould violate the hypothetical imperative, for example, by willing now\nto buy a house and yet, at the same time, willing to use the money he\nknows he needs for the down payment to make a gift to his niece. If he\nwilled to make the gift, he would be failing to will the necessary\nmeans in his power to buy the house. The Kantian hypothetical\nimperative implies that it is irrational to will to be thwarted in\nattaining ends that one is pursuing. In typical cases, if a promisee\nwilled the end of a false promisor, she would be doing just that.\n\nThere are two things that an agent who has willed something can do\nwhich would bring his action into compliance with the hypothetical\nimperative. He can either will the means that are necessary and in his\npower to the end (which, of course, would rule out his willing to be\nthwarted in attaining the end) or he can give up willing the end. For\nexample, the hypothetical imperative would not imply that it was\nirrational for the person described above to cease willing now to buy\na house and instead use the money that he knows would be required as a\ndown payment on it to make a gift to his niece.\n\nA person cannot share an agent\u2019s end, according to this third\naccount, if:\n\n\nThe person has an end such that his pursuing it at the same time that\nhe pursues the agent\u2019s end would violate the hypothetical\nimperative, and the person would be unwilling to give up pursuing this\nend, even if he was aware of the likely effects of the agent\u2019s\nsuccessful pursuit of her end.\n\n\nBy way of illustration, suppose that a doctor plans to use a healthy\npatient to obtain a heart and lungs for transplant, that is, to\nextract them from him in an operation that would kill him. We can\nimagine that the patient has many ends, for example, that of attending\nhis daughter\u2019s wedding. According to the hypothetical\nimperative, it would be irrational for him to pursue this end at the\nsame time he was pursuing the doctor\u2019s end of getting from him a\nheart and lungs for transplant. The account implies that the patient\ncannot share the doctor\u2019s end if he would be unwilling to give\nup his end of attending his daughter\u2019s wedding against the\nbackground of an awareness of the likely effects of the doctor\u2019s\nsuccessful pursuit of his organs (e.g., his life being lost and other\nlives being saved).\n\nThis notion of conditions under which a person cannot share an\nagent\u2019s end might be included in the following account: An agent\ntreats another merely as a means if the other cannot share the\nproximate end or ends the agent is pursuing in treating him as a\nmeans. An agent\u2019s proximate end is something she aims to bring\nabout directly from her use of the person. Her proximate end might\nalso be her ultimate end, say, if she uses another to avoid pain. But\nher proximate end might be far removed from her ultimate end. Someone\nmight, for example, use another to develop her skill as a violinist to\nearn a good living in an orchestra so she can put her little sisters\nthrough college, and so forth. The account invokes proximate ends\nbecause they are far more intimately connected to the use that brings\nthem about than ultimate ends need be.\n\nYet, like the other accounts we have considered, this account is\nsubject to criticism. One possible shortcoming stems from cases of\ncompetition (Kerstein 2009: 170\u2013171). Sometimes people have the\nend of being the sole winner in a competition. A competitor pursuing\nsuch an end might, according to the account, be treating his\ncompetitor merely as a means and thus acting wrongly, even though she\nabides fully with the competition\u2019s rules. To begin, competitors\nsometimes count as treating one another as means. To invoke one\naccount of doing so (discussed in\n \u00a72\n above), Player A intentionally does something to her\nopponent, Player B, for example, tries to defeat him, which\nrequires B\u2019s presence or participation. Moreover,\nA\u2019s proximate end in trying to defeat B might\nbe to win top player for the year; and B\u2019s proximate\nend in trying to defeat A might also be to win top player for\nthe year. To focus on A, she is using B to realize\nan end, namely her (A\u2019s) winning top player for the\nyear, but B cannot share this end. In willing that A\nbe top player of the year, B would, in effect, be willing to\nbe thwarted in his attempt to win top player for the year, assuming\nthat there can be no tie for top player. Finally, awareness on\nB\u2019s part of the likely effects of A\u2019s\nsuccessful pursuit of being the top player would presumably not result\nin B\u2019s being willing to give up his\n(B\u2019s) end of being top player. In trying to defeat\nB to be number one, A would be treating B\nmerely as a means and thereby acting wrongly, the account seems to\nimply, even if A competed fairly, that is, violated none of\nthe competition\u2019s rules. Some might find this implication\nimplausible. Sometimes becoming the best in some endeavor involves\ndefeating (and using) competitors to do so. But defeating (and using)\ncompetitors to be the best, especially when they have freely entered a\ncompetition, need not amount to acting wrongly, some might insist.\n3.2 Possible Consent\n\nIn the passage on false promising, Kant references possible consent.\nHe suggests that the victim of the false promise cannot agree to the\nuse the false promisor is making of him. We might conclude that the\nvictim cannot agree on the grounds that he cannot share the\npromisor\u2019s end; for it would, in the sense invoked above\n (\u00a73.1.3),\n be practically irrational for him to pursue this end. There is,\nhowever, another way of interpreting the victim\u2019s inability to\nconsent in the context of considering candidates for a plausible\nsufficient condition for an agent\u2019s treating another merely as a\nmeans. Another account, prompted by the Groundwork passage,\nis this: An agent uses another merely as a means if the other cannot\nconsent to her use of him (O\u2019Neill 1989:\n 113).[7]\n An agent cannot consent to being treated as a means if he does not\nhave the ability to avert his being treated as such by dissenting,\nthat is, by withholding his agreement to\n it.[8]\n If an agent deceives or coerces another, then the other\u2019s\ndissent is \u201cin principle ruled out\u201d (1989: 111) and thus\nso is his consent. Suppose, for example, that an appliance\nserviceperson tricks a customer into authorizing an expensive repair.\nThe customer does not really have the opportunity to dissent to the\nperson\u2019s action by refusing to give his consent to it. For he\ndoes not know what her action is, namely one of lying to him about\nwhat is wrong with his refrigerator. (If he did know what her action\nwas, then he would not be deceived.) Or suppose that a mugger\napproaches you on a dark street, points a gun at you, and tells you\nthat unless you give him all of your money, he will hurt you. He\nleaves you no opportunity to avert his use of you by withholding your\nconsent. Regardless of what you say, he is presumably going to use\nyou, whether it is through your handing over your wallet or his\nviolently taking it from you. Since you cannot consent to his action,\nthe mugger is treating you merely as a\n means.[9]\n\nThe account is subject to objections. It does not suffice for an agent\nto treat another merely as a means that the other simply be\nunable to consent to the way he is being used, some argue. If it did\nsuffice, then a passerby giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to\na collapsed jogger would be treating the jogger merely as a means and\nthus acting wrongly. But the passerby does not seem to be doing\nanything that is morally impermissible.\n\nIn light of this objection, someone might propose a different account:\nSuppose an agent uses another. She uses him merely as a means if\nsomething she has done or is doing to the other renders him\nunable to consent to her using him. Of course, although the collapsed\njogger has no opportunity to consent to the passerby\u2019s giving\nhim CPR, the passerby has not put him in that position. So this\naccount avoids the unwelcome implication that the passerby treats the\ncollapsed jogger merely as a means.\n\nHowever, this account is also open to objection. First, it fails to\ndesignate as such some cases that we, intuitively speaking, would\nsurely classify as treating others merely as means (Kerstein 2013:\n74). Think for example of a case where one person knocks someone out\nwith a \u201cdate rape\u201d drug. Another person, who had no\nknowledge of or involvement in drugging the victim, sexually assaults\nhim. Since this other person has not rendered the victim unable to\nconsent to his use of him, the account does not yield the conclusion\nthat he treats him merely as a means.\n\nThe account arguably not only fails to capture some cases of an\nagent\u2019s treating another merely as a means, but also designates\nas such some cases of deception that, intuitively speaking, are not.\nFor example, in order to make your spouse\u2019s birthday party a\nsurprise for her, you need to lie to your sister-in-law about your\nwhereabouts during a certain afternoon. You use her to quell your\nspouse\u2019s suspicions regarding your plans. As you realize, if you\ntold your sister-in-law about the party, she would be unable to keep\nthe secret from your spouse. According to the account, you treat your\nsister-in-law merely as a means, since your deception leaves her with\nno opportunity to avert your use of her. This conclusion seems\nquestionable to some, albeit not to others. Here is another case of\nwhat some think of as morally permissible deception (Parfit 2011:\n178). Suppose that, in order to save the life of an innocent witness\nto a crime, you use her to pass on a lie you have told her to the\nperpetrator, Brown. If Brown did not believe the lie, he would kill\nthe witness. You realize that if you let the witness in on what was\nnecessary to save her life and told her to lie to Brown herself, she\nwould not be able to do so effectively. Your treatment of the person\nrenders impossible her consent to your use of her. But it is\nimplausible to conclude that you are treating her merely as a means,\nsome insist.\n\nIn these two cases, it makes sense to think that the person you are\nusing can share your ends, in the sense specified in\n \u00a73.1.3.\n Your sister-in-law can share the end of your spouse not getting\nsuspicious regarding a surprise party, and, of course, the witness can\nshare the end of Brown\u2019s coming to believe some lie. Perhaps\nthat is why in these cases the person\u2019s inability to consent to\nyour use of her seems to fall short of plausibly implying that you are\nusing her merely as a means.\n3.3 Actual Consent\n\nA proposal for a sufficient condition for treating another merely as a\nmeans might invoke a notion of actual consent. Suppose an agent is\nusing another, the proposal might go; he is using her merely as a\nmeans if she has not consented to his use of her (Nozick 1974:\n30\u201331; Scanlon 2008: 107). A more detailed actual consent\nproposal is the following: \u201cAn agent uses another person merely\nas a means if and only if (1) the agent uses another person as a means\nin the service of realizing her ends (2) without, as a matter of moral\nprinciple, making this use conditional on the other\u2019s consent;\nwhere (3) by \u2018consent\u2019 is meant the other\u2019s genuine\nactual consent to being used, in a particular manner, as a means to\nthe agent\u2019s end\u201d (Kleingeld 2020: 398). Both proposals\nface challenges. For example, suppose a patient arrives in the\nemergency room unconscious, with severe injuries. The physician on\nduty judges that only an experimental treatment could preserve the\npatient\u2019s life. She therefore uses the patient in a study of a\nnew technique to prevent blood loss. Both actual consent proposals\nimply, seemingly implausibly, that the physician used the patient\nmerely as a means.\n\nOne might claim that an agent who uses another without the\nother\u2019s actual consent treats him merely as a means unless\nparticular conditions obtain: the agent lacks competency to consent,\nthe other is rationally required to consent (e.g., perhaps to preserve\nhis life), or the agent is rationally forbidden to consent (e.g.,\nperhaps to being someone\u2019s slave) (Formosa 2017: 99\u2013100). This\nproposal would avoid the implication that the physician in the\npreceding example is using the patient merely as a means; for the\npatient obviously lacks competency to consent. Yet the proposal seems\nto suffer from a shortcoming that all the actual consent accounts\nmentioned have. They all seem to imply, implausibly, that an agent\nwould be treating another merely as a means in cases such as this\n(Cohen 1995: 243): Someone uses another without the other\u2019s\nconsent to prevent the light from shining in her eyes, by positioning\nherself in an appropriate way.\n3.4 Invoking Moral Notions (or Not)\n\nA distinction worth noting in accounts of using others merely as means\nis that between ones that do and ones that do not appeal to moral\nconcepts. A clear example of the former type of account is the\nfollowing: X uses Y merely as a means if and only if (1) X uses Y as a\nmeans and (2) X\u2019s use of Y violates a duty that X owes to Y\n(Fahmy 2023: 58). To determine whether an agent uses another merely as\na means on this account, it is obviously necessary to rely on views\nregarding which duties the agent owes to the other. Not surprisingly,\nphilosophers who offer such accounts sometimes invoke Kant\u2019s\nnotion that persons have dignity that demands respect as a basis for\ndetermining our moral duties (2023: 50) (Formosa 2017: 108). A worry\nconcerning these accounts is that the light they shed on what treating\nothers merely as means amounts to is limited by the clarity, or lack\nthereof, in the moral notions they invoke.\n\nOther philosophers suggest sufficient conditions for a person treating\nanother merely as a means that seem not to depend on any moral\nconcepts (Kerstein 2013: 76) (Audi 2016: 4, 56\u201357). It is often easier\nto discern the implications, both plausible and implausible, of these\naccounts than the implications of accounts that rely on disputed or\nvague moral concepts such as our dignity or rights as persons. Of\ncourse, not only accounts of when agents treat others merely as means,\nbut also accounts of when they do not do so (Section 5) differ in\nwhether they are grounded in moral concepts.\n4. Treating Another Merely as a Means and Acting Wrongly\n\nKant holds that if someone treats another merely as a means, the\nperson acts wrongly, that is, does something morally impermissible.\nSome accounts of treating others merely as means seem not to yield the\nconclusion that if a person treats another in this way, then he acts\nwrongly. On one \u201crough definition\u201d, we use another merely\nas a means if we both use the other and regard him\n\n\nas a mere instrument or tool: someone whose well-being and moral\nclaims we ignore, and whom we would treat in whatever ways would best\nachieve our aims. (Parfit 2011: 213 and 227)\n\n\nFor example, a kidnapper treats his victim merely as a means if she\nuses him for profit and thinks of him simply as a tool that she would\ntreat in any way necessary for profit. This account takes quite\nliterally \u201cmerely\u201d in \u201ctreating others merely as\nmeans\u201d. According to it, treating another merely as a means\namounts roughly to treating the other solely or exclusively as a\ntool.\n\nIf this is how we understand treating others merely as means, then\ndoing so does not always amount to acting wrongly, it\n appears.[10]\n Suppose that a gangster considers a barista a mere tool to get coffee\nand that he would treat her in whichever way would best serve his\ninterests. In buying coffee from her, the gangster treats her merely\nas a means on this account, but does not, it seems, act wrongly\n(Parfit 2011: 216).\n\nOn a more detailed, but similar, understanding of treating another\nmerely as a means, it also seems that the gangster might be doing so\nand yet not be acting wrongly. According to this account:\n\u201cTreating a person merely as a means is doing something toward\nthat person . . . on the basis of instrumental motivation, with no\nmotivational concern regarding any non-instrumental aspects of the\naction(s), and with a disposition not to acquire such a concern\u201d\n(Audi 2016 56\u201357).\n\n\nThese notions of treating others merely as means seem not to coincide\nwith Kant\u2019s notion of doing so. Recall Kant\u2019s example of\nmaking a false promise to another for financial gain. Suppose that a\nparticular false promiser would not do just anything to the other for\ngain for himself, for example, he would not murder the other\u2019s\nfamily. And suppose that this false promisor does have\nnon-instrumental motivational concern for the other in that he would\nnot make this false promise if it would likely result in the other\nneeding to declare bankruptcy. According to Kant\u2019s notion, but\nnot to these accounts, it appears, the false promisor would be\ntreating the other merely as a\n means.[11]\n\nWe might question whether treating another merely as a means amounts\nto acting wrongly even if we focus on the candidate sufficient\nconditions examined above. For the sake of simplicity, let us focus on\nthe possible consent account\n (\u00a73.2),\n according to which an agent treats another merely as a means if the\nother cannot consent to her use of him. (We could just as effectively\nemploy other proposed sufficient conditions we have discussed for just\nusing another.) Suppose that two muggers attack a victim. The victim\nviolently pushes one of the muggers into the other, so that he (the\nvictim) can make his escape. The victim uses the mugger he pushes, and\nthe mugger presumably is unable to avert this use simply by dissenting\nfrom it. Yet many would object to the idea that the victim is acting\nwrongly. One response to this issue would be to build into accounts of\ntreating another merely as a means the specification that one is not\ndoing that if he is using someone in order to prevent himself or\nsomeone else from being treated in this way. Building in this\nspecification would, of course, tend to make accounts somewhat\nunwieldy. Other examples might render more difficult to accept the\nidea that treating another merely as a means is always morally\nimpermissible. Suppose, for example, that we use one person to save a\nmillion people from nuclear conflagration, without giving the one any\nopportunity to avert the use by dissenting from it. We thereby treat\nthe one merely as a means, according to a possible consent account.\nBut do we act wrongly? Some hold that we do\n not.[12]\n\nThey might defend the view that while it is always wrong pro\ntanto to treat another merely as a means, doing so is sometimes\nmorally permissible, all things considered. In other words, we always\nhave strong moral reasons not to treat others merely as means, but\nthese reasons can be outweighed by other moral considerations,\npresumably including the good of many lives being preserved. If,\ncontrary to Kant\u2019s view, the moral constraint against treating\nothers merely as means is not absolute, then a question arises as to\nwhen it gets overridden.\n5. Using Another, but Not Merely as a Means\n\nWe have explored sufficient conditions for treating another merely as\na means. But just as challenging as pinpointing them is specifying\nwhen someone uses another, but not merely as a means.\nAccording to one proposal, if an agent uses another, she does\nnot use him merely as a means if he gives his voluntary,\ninformed consent to her use of him. To fix ideas let us say that the\nconsent of the person being used is voluntary only if he is not being\ncoerced into giving it and informed only if he understands how he is\nbeing used and to what purpose(s). This proposal seems intuitively\nattractive. If a person agrees to someone using him and understands\nher ends in doing so, then how can she be treating him merely as a\nmeans?\n\nAppealing to reflective common sense, philosophers have tried to\nillustrate how. We might refer to one range of cases they invoke as\nexploitation cases because they seem to involve one person\ntaking unfair advantage of another, which is a hallmark of\nexploitation (Wertheimer 1996). To cite one such case, suppose that a\nmother of modest means cannot afford to give her children a good\neducation. A rich person proposes to finance her children\u2019s\nenrollment at excellent schools in exchange for her serving as his\npersonal slave (Davis 1984: 392). The mother might understand the use\nhe intends to put her to and for what purposes. Moreover, if we think\nof coercion as involving an agent threatening to make someone worse\noff than she would be if she did not interact with the agent, then the\nrich person would not count as coercing the mother into agreeing to\nhis use of her. The account of using another but not merely as a means\nthat we are considering might, therefore, imply that the rich person\nis not just using the mother in making her his personal slave. That\nimplication strikes some as implausible.\n\nAnother type of case that might cause problems for this account\ninvokes unnecessary or otiose threats designed to force another to\nserve one\u2019s purposes. Here is an example of such a case. An\nelderly salesperson thinks that his company is trying to force him\ninto retirement by keeping its latest sales leads from him. Desperate\nto make a sale, he intends to use his office manager to obtain the\nlatest leads. The manager has the password to a database housing the\nleads. He tells her that he really needs to close some deals, and\nunless she gets the latest leads for him, he is going to reveal to\neveryone in the office that she is lesbian. He believes reasonably,\ngiven his incomplete understanding of her and of the attitudes of his\nother co-workers, that this revelation would be damaging to her\nreputation. But the office manager takes the salesperson, whom she\nthinks of as a friendly colleague, to be making an ill-advised joke.\nVirtually everyone in the office is already aware of her sexual\npreference. And, she believes, the salesperson is cognizant that it is\ncompany policy that all salespeople are to be granted access to the\nlatest leads upon request. She gives him a puzzled look and agrees to\nget him the leads right away.\n\nThe salesperson receives from the office manager her voluntary,\ninformed consent to his use of her to get the leads. She understands\nthat he intends to use her to this end. Granted, he threatens to make\nher worse off if she does not give him the leads. But it is not the\nthreat, which she does not even register as such, that generates her\nagreement to his use of her. She agrees voluntarily. Yet, despite\nobtaining her consent for his use of her, some believe that the\nsalesperson treats the office manager merely as a means and acts (at\nleast pro tanto) wrongly. Others might argue that although\nthe salesperson has revealed a moral deficiency, he has not\ndone anything wrong. Rather, he has simply revealed a morally\nfaulty attitude toward the office manager (Scanlon 2008: 46; Walen\n2014: 428\u2013429). If we judge that the salesperson does act\nwrongly, then we presumably take this case to illustrate that treating\nanother merely as a means does not necessarily amount to harming her.\nIn other words, in treating another merely as a means, an individual\ncan wrong another without harming her.\n\nRegardless of whether we judge in this case that the salesperson acts\nwrongly, the case helps to illustrate a distinction between\nagent-focused and patient-focused accounts of treating or not treating\nanother merely as a means. According to the account we are\nconsidering, let us recall, if an agent uses another, she does\nnot use him merely as a means if he gives his voluntary,\ninformed consent to her use of him. This account focuses on the other,\nthat is, on the individual treated as a means to determine whether the\nagent is treating him merely as a means. If he (i.e., the\nother) gives his informed, voluntary consent to being used in some\nway, then the agent does not treat him merely as a means, according to\nthe account. To make this determination, an agent-focused account\nwould, of course, focus more on the agent. Such an account might hold,\nfor example, that if an agent uses another, she does not use him\nmerely as a means if it is reasonable for her (the agent) to\nbelieve that the other gives his voluntary, informed consent to\nher use of him. According to the notion of reasonable belief invoked\nhere, it is reasonable for someone to believe something roughly if the\nbelief is justifiable given the person\u2019s context (e.g., his\nupbringing, cognitive limitations, and so forth). Contrary to the\npatient-focused account, the agent-focused account is free from the\nimplication that the salesperson is not treating the office manager\nmerely as a means. It is not reasonable for the salesperson\nto believe that the office manager has given her voluntary consent to\nhis use of her. It is, rather, reasonable for him to believe that he\nhas coerced her into giving him the sales leads. A parallel\npatient-based vs. agent-based distinction applies, of course, to\naccounts of sufficient conditions for treating another merely as a\nmeans. One might, for example, hold that an agent just uses another if\nthe other cannot share the end the agent is pursuing in using him (a\npatient-focused account). Or one might hold that an agent just uses\nanother if it is reasonable for her to believe that the other cannot\nshare the end the agent is pursuing in using him (an agent-focused\naccount).\n\nWe have been considering actual consent accounts of agents using\nothers, but not treating them merely as means. We can also develop\naccounts that invoke other concepts familiar from discussion of\nsufficient conditions for treating others merely as means, including\nthe concepts of possible end-sharing and possible consent. For\nexample, we might suggest that an agent who uses another does not use\nthat other merely as a means if the other can consent to the\nagent\u2019s use of him, that is, if the other can avert the use\nsimply by dissenting from it. This suggestion, as well as others that\ninvoke additional concepts we have considered, such as that of end\nsharing, might generate questionable verdicts regarding exploitation\ncases. For example, the mother of modest means discussed above can\nconsent to the rich person\u2019s use of her. Her dissent from it\nalone would stop it from occurring. But some would insist that the\nrich person is nevertheless treating her merely as a means in making\nher his personal slave in exchange for educating his children.\n\nAnother approach to conditions under which an agent uses another, but\ndoes not treat him merely as a means takes shape against a literal\nconstrual of treating others merely as means. On this construal,\ndiscussed above, we use another merely as a means roughly if we both\nuse the other and regard him as a mere tool. According to the\napproach, we do not treat another merely as a means if our\ntreatment of the other person \u201cis governed or guided in\nsufficiently important ways by some relevant moral belief or\nconcern\u201d (Parfit 2011: 214). But when is an agent\u2019s use of\nanother governed in sufficiently important ways by some relevant moral\nbelief or concern? The agent\u2019s use of another is so governed,\naccording to one response, when the agent tries to and succeeds in\nusing the other only in ways to which the other can rationally\nconsent.\n\nBut when can the other rationally consent? To simplify matters, let us\nmake some background assumptions. Let us suppose that the people who\nmight be used understand what will be done to them and to what\npurpose, as well as the effects the use will have. Let us also assume\nthat those who might be used have the power to give (or to withhold)\nconsent in the \u201cact-affecting sense\u201d (Parfit 2011:\n183\u2013184). When we ask whether they can rationally consent to\nbeing used, we are asking whether it would be rational for them to\nconsent (or dissent) supposing that their choice would determine\nwhether or not they were used.\n\nAgainst the background of these assumptions, we can say that, on this\naccount, a person can rationally consent to being treated as a means\njust in case he has sufficient reasons to consent to it. The\naccount rests on an \u201cobjective\u201d view of reasons, according\nto which\n\n\nthere are certain facts that give us reasons both to have certain\ndesires and aims, and to do whatever might achieve these aims. These\nreasons are given by facts about the objects of these desires\nor aims, or what we might want or try to achieve. (Parfit 2011:\n45)\n\n\nFor example, the fact that a child is in pain as a result of a\nsplinter stuck in his finger gives me reason to want to and to try to\nget it\n out.[13]\n On this account, we have impartial as well as partial reasons for\nagreeing to be treated in various ways. Our impartial reasons are\n\u201cperson-neutral\u201d (2011: 138). We do not need to invoke\nourselves when we describe the facts that yield these reasons. The\nfact that some event would cause tremendous pain to a particular\nperson, for example, gives us reason (albeit perhaps not sufficient\nreason) to prevent the event or relieve the pain \u201cwhoever this\nperson may be, and whatever this person\u2019s relation to us\u201d\n(2011: 138). Our partial reasons are \u201cperson-relative\u201d:\nthey \u201care provided by facts whose description must refer to\nus\u201d (2011: 138). The fact that the little boy being hurt by the\nsplinter is my son gives me a partial reason to pull it out.\nWe each have partial reasons to be particularly attentive to our own\nwell-being and to the well-being of those in our circle, for example,\nour family and friends. According to the account,\n\n\nWhen one of our two possible acts would make things go in some way\nthat would be impartially better, but the other act would make things\ngo better either for ourselves or for those to whom we have close\nties, we often have sufficient reasons to act in either of these ways.\n(2011: 137)\n\n\nFor example, regarding a case in which a person could either save\nhimself from some injury or do something that would save some\nstranger\u2019s life in a distant land, the person presumably has\nsufficient reasons to do either one. In a similar vein, a person can\nhave sufficient reason to consent to being treated as a means by\nvirtue of some impartial reason, such as the fact that his being so\ntreated will save many lives, even if he also has sufficient reason to\ndissent from being treated as a means by virtue of some partial\nreason, such as the fact that his being so treated will result in\nsuffering for him. In sum, this account holds that if an agent uses\nanother, he does not use the other merely as a means if the other has\nsufficient reasons, as just characterized, for agreeing to be\nused.\n\nThe account seems to imply that cases thought to be paradigmatic of\ntreating others merely as means do not involve treating them in this\nway. Take a case in which a pedestrian is on a bridge above a track\nwhere a train is barreling toward five people (Parfit 2011: 218). The\nonly way to save the five would be to open, by remote control, a\ntrap-door on which the pedestrian is standing, so that he would fall\nin front of the train. The train would kill him, but the impact would\ntrigger its automatic brake. If a bystander opens the trap door, then\nshe uses the pedestrian as a means to save the five. The pedestrian\nhas sufficient reasons to refrain from consenting to being used to\nstop the train. After all, it will result in his premature death. But,\naccording to the account, he also might have sufficient reasons to\nconsent to being used to stop the train; for his being used in this\nway would save the lives of five people, contributing to an outcome\nwhich is presumably impartially best (2011: 220). Suppose the\nbystander opens the trap door and uses the person on the bridge to\nsave the five. In so doing, she might be limiting her use of another\nto ways to which the other can rationally consent. If she is, then she\nis not treating the person merely as a means, according to the\naccount.\n\nConsider another well-known example. Five patients at a hospital are\nin immediate need of different organs. One patient needs a kidney,\nanother needs a liver, and so forth. If a surgeon used a healthy\nperson undergoing routine tests as a resource for organs, killing him\nin the process, all of the five would be saved (Harman 1977:\n3\u20134). The healthy person presumably has strong partial reasons\nto dissent from being used for his organs. But he also arguably has\nenough impartial reason to consent, namely, that five people will\nthereby be saved, such that overall he has sufficient reason to\nconsent. So, assuming that the surgeon is trying to treat people only\nin ways to which they can rationally consent, she might not be\ntreating the healthy person merely as a means, even if before she\nsucceeds in putting him under, he is begging for his\n life.[14]\n If the account we are considering of using others, but not merely as\nmeans does entail that the bystander and the doctor in these two cases\nare not treating others merely as means, the account suffers from a\nsignificant flaw, according to some.\n\nIn the words of one philosopher, the idea that it is wrong to treat\nothers merely as means is \u201cboth very important and very hard to\npin down\u201d (Glover 2006: 65). Our investigation has illustrated\nchallenges in specifying what it means to treat others merely as\nmeans. It has not revealed one, univocal concept, grounded in common\nsense, of what just using another amounts to. In the end, there may be\nno such concept, but rather a set of overlapping notions, which point\nto a range of morally problematic actions or attitudes concerning the\nuse of others.",
