    "main_text": "\n\nSpecial obligations are obligations owed to some subset of persons, in\ncontrast to natural duties that are owed to all persons simply\nqua persons. Common sense morality seems to understand us as\nhaving special obligations to those to whom we stand in some sort of\nspecial relationship, e.g., our friends, our family members, our\ncolleagues, our fellow citizens, and those to whom we have made\npromises or commitments of some sort. Special obligations are often\nappealed to in arguments against consequentialism, because\nconsequentialism is unable to accommodate agent-relative reasons and\ngenuinely special obligations are agent-relative reasons. Attempts to\ndefend special obligations run up against objections from insiders\n\u2013 why suppose that I am obligated to do more for certain persons\njust because I happen to stand in some special relationship to them?\n\u2013 and also from outsiders \u2013 why do other persons get more\nbenefits just because they happen to stand in special relationships to\nother persons? Attempts to ground special obligations have appealed to\ndiverse states of affairs, including the intrinsic nature of the\nspecial relationship, the nature of the party to whom the obligations\nare owed, the expectations of the party to whom the obligations are\nowed, and the nature of persons as psychological continuants bound by\nrelations between mental states.\n",
