Philosophical Issues Raised by Prophecy\n\nIt is often assumed that the primary purpose of prophecy is to\nforetell the future, but this is not always the case. In the great\nmonotheistic religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam),\nfor instance, a prophet is taken to be a person who makes God\u2019s\nwill particularly clear, whether or not this involves making\npredictions about the future. As William Hasker says, in these\ntraditions, prophets are usually involved in \u201cwitnessing to the\npeople concerning God\u2019s purposes and requirements and seeking to\nrecall them to obedience\u201d (Hasker 1989, 194). There are\nfascinating debates in these religious traditions, especially in the\nmedieval period, debates that we will not discuss here (see Kreisel\n2001, Shatz 1998, Rahman 2011, Lorch 2016, L\u00f3pez-Farjeat 2014,\nand the entries in this encyclopedia concerning the key figures\ndiscussed in those sources). Related questions about how a human\nperson might come to know God\u2019s will through some kind of\nrevelation are also discussed elsewhere in this encyclopedia, for\nexample in the entries on\n the epistemology of religion\n and\n philosophy and Christian theology.\n\nWhen philosophers discuss prophecy, they are typically interested in\nprophecies concerning the contingent future, so that will be the focus\nin the remainder of this article. What special philosophical issues\nare raised by this kind of prophecy?\n\nLet\u2019s say that a future event is contingent if and only if it is\nnot determined that it will happen and also not determined that it\nwill not happen. (For more on the notion of determinism, see the entry\non\n causal determinism.)\n Now suppose that based upon the revelation of an infallible God, a\nperson prophecies that some future contingent event will occur. Since\nGod cannot be wrong, does it follow that the future contingent event\nmust occur? And if it must occur, how can it be a contingent\nevent?\n\nAn especially vivid example of this kind of situation comes from the\nChristian tradition. Jesus reportedly prophesied that his disciple\nPeter would deny him three times before the cock crowed (see Matthew\n26:34). Typically, we would think of Peter\u2019s denial as a free\nact, and hence it is a future contingent event at the time of\nJesus\u2019s prophecy. (For more on this connection, see the entries\non\n compatibilism,\n free will, and\n causal determinism.)\n But since Jesus cannot be mistaken (according to Christian theology),\nhow are Peter\u2019s later denials free? Once Jesus\u2019 words\nbecome part of the unalterable past, don\u2019t they guarantee a\nparticular future, whether or not Peter is willing to cooperate?\n\nThis problem is an especially interesting instance of the more general\nproblem of the compatibility of God\u2019s complete foreknowledge\nwith the existence of future contingent events (for more on this\ngeneral problem, see the entry on\n divine foreknowledge and human freedom).\n Whereas the more general question about God\u2019s foreknowledge\ntypically involves just God\u2019s knowledge and the future\ncontingent event, the problem of prophecy involves a third element,\nnamely, the prophecy itself, which becomes a part of the past history\nof the world as soon as it is made. This additional element adds an\ninteresting twist to the general problem, making it more difficult to\nsolve.\n",
