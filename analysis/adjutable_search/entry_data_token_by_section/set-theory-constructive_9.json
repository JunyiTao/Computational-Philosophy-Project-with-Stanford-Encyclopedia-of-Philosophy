    "main_text": "Proof Theory and Semantics of Constructive and Intuitionistic ZF || Large sets in constructive and intuitionistic ZF\n5.2 Large sets in constructive and intuitionistic ZF\n\n\nA prominent area of research in classical set theory is that of large\ncardinals (see the entry on\n set theory). In constructive contexts, the ordinals are not linearly\nordered. (For the notion of constructive ordinal and a brief\ndiscussion of its properties, see the supplementary document on: \nSet-theoretic Principles Incompatible with Intuitionistic Logic.) \n As a consequence, cardinal numbers do not play the same role as in the classical\n setting.\n\n\nOne can nonetheless study the impact of \u201creflection\nprinciples\u201d of the form of large set axioms.\nFor example, one can add to constructive and intuitionistic set theories \nan axiom asserting the existence of inaccessible \nsets.[2] \n The addition of large set axioms to intuitionistic ZF was first proposed\nby Friedman and Scedrov (Friedman and Scedrov 1984). One of their\naim was to shed light on the corresponding classical\nnotions; another was to study the impact of these principles on\nmetatheoretical properties of the original set theories. Friedman and\nScedrov have shown, for example, that the addition of large set axioms\ndoes not compromise the validity of the disjunction and numerical\nexistence properties for IZF.\n\n\nIn the context of constructive set theory, large sets have been\nintroduced by Aczel in the form of so-called regular sets to\nallow inductive definitions of sets (Aczel 1986). Rathjen and Crosilla\nhave considered inaccessible sets (Rathjen al. 1998; Crosilla and\nRathjen 2001) and Mahlo sets (Rathjen 2003a). Nevertheless, an\nobjection could be raised to extensions of constructive set theory by\nlarge set axioms. In classical set theory, large cardinals can be seen\nas an incarnation of higher infinity. How do we justify these\nprinciples constructively? The constructive justification of these\nnotions relies again on the type theoretic interpretation. The\naddition of these principles corresponds in fact to that of universes\nand \\(W\\)-types within constructive type theory. The\njustification of extensions by large sets is thus bound up with the\nquestion of the limits of Martin-L\u00f6f type theory (Rathjen\n2005). We also note that the addition of inacessible set axioms\n to a weak subsystem of CZF\n(with no set induction) produces a theory of strength\n\\(\\Gamma_0\\), the ordinal singled out by Feferman and\nSch\u00fctte as the limit of predicativity given the natural numbers (Crosilla and\nRathjen 2001; see also section 1.3). This is \nwitness to the fact that by working in a constructive, predicative\ncontext, we can tame traditionally strong set-theoretic notions.\n\nCrosilla and Rathjen\u2019s set theory with inaccessible sets (but no set\ninduction) is proof theoretically rather weak, but mathematically\nquite expressive. For example, it has been used to verify that the\naddition of Voevodsky\u2019s Univalence Axiom to Martin-L\u00f6f type\ntheory does not engender impredicativity (Rathjen 2017). The axiom of\nUnivalence was introduced by Voevodsky as part of his Univalent\nFoundations programme (Voevodsky 2015). (For Univalent Foundations,\nsee the entries on \n type theory \nand on\n intuitionistic type theory). \nVoevodsky gave a model of constructive type theory with\nthe Univalence Axiom which is based on Kan simplicial sets (see\nKapulkin & Lumsdaine 2012, Other Internet Resources). The\nsimplicial model of constructive type theory with univalence developed\nin the above article is carried out within an extension of ZFC with\ninaccessible cardinals. This prompted the question whether one could\ngive a more constructive model of this type theory, and, in\nparticular, whether the type theory is predicative. Bezem, Coquand and\nHuber (2014) have recently proposed a model of this type theory in\ncubical sets which is computational and \u201ccan be expressed in a\nconstructive metalogic\u201d. Rathjen (2017) has verified that this new\nmodel can be codified in a suitable extension of CZF by inaccessible\nsets which is much weaker than classical set theory with inaccessible\ncardinals. In fact, it turns out that if we take as starting point a\nrelatively weak type theory, i.e. one without W-types, and extend it\nby the Univalence Axiom, the resulting theory has proof theoretic\nstrength \\(\\Gamma_0\\), the ordinal usually taken to represent the\nlimit of predicativity given the natural numbers (Rathjen 2017). To\nshow this, one proves that the cubical model by Bezem, Coquand and\nHuber can be carried out in an extension of the system introduced in\nCrosilla and Rathjen (2001) by (bounded) Relativized Dependent\nChoice. It follows from (Crosilla and Rathjen 2001) and (Rathjen 2003)\nthat the latter has proof theoretic ordinal \\(\\Gamma_0\\). \n",
