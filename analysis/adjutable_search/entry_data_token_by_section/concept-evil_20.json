    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Evil Character/Personhood || Regularity Accounts\n4.4 Regularity Accounts\n\nAccording to regularity accounts, evil persons have evil-making\nproperties frequently, or on a regular basis (See, e.g., Card 2002,\n21; Kekes 1990, 48; 1998, 217; 2005, 3; Stone 2009, 23). For instance,\nJohn Kekes writes that when \u201cagents are regular sources of evil\n... we can identify them, and not merely their actions and character\ntraits, as evil\u201d (Kekes 1990, 48). An advantage of regularity\naccounts is that they explain the intuition that evil persons deserve\nour strongest moral condemnation (Russell 2014, 135). For if evil\npersons have evil-making properties frequently, or on a regular basis,\nthen it makes sense to say that they are the worst sorts of people and\ndeserve our strongest moral condemnation.\n\nHowever, one problem with regularity accounts is that they do not seem\nto be able to make sense of the fact that some evil persons only very\nrarely (if ever) have evil-making properties. For instance, Luke\nRussell argues that we should reject regularity accounts because they\ncannot accommodate the intuition that a brooding spree killer could be\nevil (Russell 2014, 139). The brooding spree killer does not perform\nevil actions frequently or regularly. She plans and fantasizes about\nher attack, and then performs evil actions sporadically or all at\nonce. Thus, Russell argues, if brooding spree killers can be evil, as\nwe think they can be, then we should reject regularity accounts.\n\nNotice, however, that Russell\u2019s counterexample only works\nagainst action-based regularity accounts, since proponents of affect\nor motivation based regularity accounts could argue that brooding\nspree killers do have evil-making properties, i.e. evil feelings or\nevil desires, habitually or regularly during the planning and/or\nfantasizing phase (even if they do not perform evil actions) and thus,\ncount as evil persons on these sorts of regularity accounts. So the\nquestion becomes, are there persons who are comparable to brooding\nspree killers in that they have evil feelings or desires sporadically\nor infrequently rather than on a regular basis? It seems that there\nmight be cases of this sort when opportunities for evil feelings and\ndesires are scarce. For example, we can imagine that an evil person\nmight fail to have evil feelings and desires because she has been\nstranded on a deserted island. After many years without potential\nvictims and needing to focus all of her attention on survival, she\nmight lack evil feelings and desires due to a poverty of stimulus.\nThis would mean that she is no longer an evil person on affect and\nmotivation based regularity accounts. However, it seems that we should\nsay that she is still an evil person if she is still disposed to have\nevil feelings and desires in the sense that her evil feelings and\ndesires would immediately return if she were presented with a victim.\nIf so, we should reject affect and motivation based regularity\naccounts.\n",
