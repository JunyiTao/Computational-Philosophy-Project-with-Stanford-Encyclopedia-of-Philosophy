    "main_text": "The Ethics of Memory || The ethics of external memory\n10.5 The ethics of memory modification and enhancement\n\nWith the emergence of new techniques for altering the functioning of\nmemory systems\u2014for example, retrieval of a stored memory results\nin a period of reconsolidation during which the retrieved memory is\nlabile and susceptible to modification, potentially allowing\ninterventions to alter traumatic memories (Spiers & Bendor\n2014)\u2014ethical questions concerning various forms of memory\nmodification have become more pressing (Erler 2011; Hui &\nFisher 2015; N. Levy 2012; Liao & Wasserman 2007). Liao and\nSandberg (2008) identify a number of questions raised by memory\nmodification technologies; in light of the close relationship between\nmemory and the self noted above, it is no surprise that many of these\nconcern the effects of memory modification on the self. Modifying\nsomeone\u2019s memories may, for example, limit his self-knowledge by\ndepriving him of opportunities to learn about his own actions or erode\nhis sense of agency by depriving him of the possibility of viewing\nhimself as an agent with respect to events in which he was involved.\nNevertheless, Liao and Sandberg argue that, in certain cases, the\nbenefits of memory modification may outweigh its costs, so that there\nneed be no general ethical barrier to the use of emerging memory\nmodification technologies. Much of the debate so far has focussed on\nthe suppression of traumatic or otherwise undesirable memories, but\nparallel questions are raised by the use of novel methods for the\nenhancement of memory abilities by pharmaceutical and other\nmeans (Bostrom & Sandberg 2009). Critics of the memory\nenhancement debate, however, have argued that the evidence for the efficacy of\nthe relevant methods is mixed (Zohny 2015) or that the debate often\noverlooks important differences among kinds of memory (Fox, Fitz,\n& Reiner forthcoming).\n",
