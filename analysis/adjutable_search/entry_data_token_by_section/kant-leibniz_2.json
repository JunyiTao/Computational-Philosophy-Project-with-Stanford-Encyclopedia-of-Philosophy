    "main_text": "The Identity of Indiscernibles\n3. The Identity of Indiscernibles\n\nThe Leibnizian principle that \u201cthere are never two things in\nnature which are exactly alike and in which it is impossible to find a\ndifference that is internal or founded on an intrinsic\ndenomination\u201d is enunciated in the Monadology (G 6:\n608), as well as in the Correspondence with Samuel Clarke (G\n7: 372). Leibniz had abandoned his earlier view that two entities\ncould be distinguished by place alone when he came to his view of real\nsubstances as infinitely complex and unique and space as ideal. Kant\nfound the Principle arbitrary. To insist that any two objects\npresented to us in experience must be qualitatively different in some\nrespect was, Kant said, to take appearances for intelligibilia (KRV A\n264/B320). We cannot have two concepts \u2014 concepts of two things\n\u2014 that are alike in all their specifications, but we can\ncertainly have two empirical objects that are exactly alike. Why\nshould we not be able to imagine two identical water droplets?\n(20:280). It is sufficient for there to be two that they present\nthemselves to us (veridically) in our visual space as two.\nLeibniz\u2019s blunder on this score was, for Kant, an indication\nthat Leibniz had failed to grasp an important feature of sensory\nexperience, namely that it, unlike thought in general, is always\nspatial.\n",
