    "main_text": "Introduction || Critical interpretations of Locke\u2019s moral philosophy\n1.2 Critical interpretations of Locke\u2019s moral philosophy\n\nThe first interpretation of Locke\u2019s moral theory is what we might call\nan incompatibility thesis: Locke scholars Laslett, Aaron, von Leyden,\namong others, hold that Locke\u2019s natural law theory is nothing more\nthan a relic from Locke\u2019s early years, when he wrote the Essays on\nthe Law of Nature, and represents a rogue element in the mature\nempiricist framework of the Essay. For these commentators,\nthe two elements found in the Essay seem not only\nincommensurable, but the hedonism seems the obvious and\nstraightforward fit with Locke\u2019s generally empiricist epistemology.\nThe general view is that Locke\u2019s rationalism seems, for all intents\nand purposes, to have no significant role to play, either in the\nacquisition of moral knowledge or in the recognition of the obligatory\nforce of moral rules. These fundamental aspects of morality seem to be\ntaken care of by Locke\u2019s hedonism. Worse than this, however, is that\nthe two views rely on radically different epistemological principles.\nThe conclusion tends to be that Locke is holding on to moral\nrationalism in the face of serious incoherence. The incompatibility\nthesis is supported by the fact that Locke seems to emphasize the role\nof pleasure and pain in moral decision-making, however it has\ndifficulty making sense of the presence of Locke\u2019s moral rationalism\nin the Essay and other of Locke\u2019s later works (not to mention\nthe exalted role he gives to rationally-deduced moral law). Added to\nthis, even in Locke\u2019s early work, he seems to hold both positions\nsimultaneously. Aaron and von Leyden both throw up their hands.\nAccording to von Leyden, in the introduction to his 1954 edition of\nLocke\u2019s Essays on the Law of Nature,\n\nthe development of [Locke\u2019s] hedonism and certain other views held by\nhim in later years made it indeed difficult for him to adhere\nwhole-heartedly to his doctrine of natural law. (Locke 1954, 14)\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Aaron writes:\n\nTwo theories compete with each other in [Locke\u2019s] mind. Both are\nretained; yet their retention means that a consistent moral theory\nbecomes difficult to find. (Aaron 1971, 257)\n\n\nYet, it is curious that Locke neither claimed to find these strands\nincompatible, nor ever abandoned his rationalistic natural law view.\nIt seems unlikely that this view would be nothing more than a\nconfusing hangover from earlier days. Taking seriously Locke\u2019s\ncommitment to both is therefore a much more charitable approach, and\none that takes seriously Locke\u2019s clear commitment to the benefits of\nrationally-apprehending our moral duties. An approach along these\nlines is one we might call a compatibility approach to the question of\nLocke\u2019s moral commitments. John Colman and Stephen Darwall are two\nLocke scholars who have argued that Locke\u2019s view is neither plagued\nwith tensions nor incoherent. Their common view is that the two\nelements of Locke\u2019s theory are doing different work. Locke\u2019s hedonism,\non this compatibility account, is intended as a theory of moral\nmotivation, and serves to fill a motivational gap between knowing\nmoral law and having reasons to obey moral law. Locke introduces\nhedonism in order to account for the practical force of the\nobligations arising from natural law. As Darwall writes,\n\nwhat makes God\u2019s commands morally obligatory [i.e., God\u2019s authority]\nappears\u2026to have nothing intrinsically to do with what makes\nthem rationally compelling. (Darwall 1995, 37).\n\n\nThus, on this account, reason deduces natural law, but it is\nhedonistic considerations alone that offer agents the motivating\nreasons to act in accordance with its dictates.\n\nThis interpretation convincingly makes room for both elements in\nLocke\u2019s view. A central feature of this interpretation is its\nattention to the legalistic aspect of Locke\u2019s natural law theory. For\nLocke, the very notion of law presupposes an authority structure as\nthe basis for its institution and its enforcement. The law carries\nobligatory weight by virtue of its reflecting the will of a rightful\nsuperior. That it also carries the threat of sanctions lends\nmotivational force to the law.\n\nA slight modification of the compatibility account, however, better\ncaptures the motivational aspect of Locke\u2019s rationalistic account:\nLocke does, at times suggest that rational agents are not only\nobligated, but motivated, by sheer recognition of the divine authority\nof moral law. It is helpful to think of morality as carrying both\nintrinsic and extrinsic obligatory force for Locke. On the one hand\nmoral rules obligate by dint of their divine righteousness, and on the\nother hand by the threat of rewards and punishments. The suggestion\nthat morality has an intrinsic motivational force appears in the\nEssays on the Law of Nature and is retained by Locke in some\nof his final published works. It is, however, a feature of his view\nthat gets somewhat underappreciated in the secondary literature, and\nfor understandable reasons\u2014Locke tends to emphasize hedonistic\nmotivations. Why this is will be discussed in\n section 4.\n At this point, however, it suffices to say that Locke\u2019s theory does\nnot have the motivational gap that the compatibility thesis\nsuggests\u2014hedonism serves as a \u2018back-up\u2019 motivational\ntool in the absence of the right degree of rational intuition of one\u2019s\nmoral duty.\n",
