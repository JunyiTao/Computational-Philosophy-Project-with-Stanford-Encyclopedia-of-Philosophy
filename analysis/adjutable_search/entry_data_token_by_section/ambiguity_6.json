    "main_text": "Types of Ambiguity\n3. Types of Ambiguity\n\nThere are different sources and types of ambiguities. To explore\nthese, however, we will need to adopt some terminology to make clear\nwhat sorts of phenomena we are looking at. Those familiar with some of\nthe issues in current syntactic theory can skip until the next\nsection.\n\nModern linguistic theory involves, in part, the study of syntax. The\ndominant strain of current syntactic theory takes the lexicon as\nprimitive and studies the rule-governed derivation of syntactic forms,\nwhich are structures known as LFs (or, more misleadingly, Logical\nForms). The relationship of sentences in natural language to LFs can\nbe one to many: the phonological/orthographic forms of a sentence can\nbe associated with more than one LF. Thus, \u2018every man loves a\nwoman\u2019 has been argued (e.g., May 1977) to involve two distinct\nlogical forms. It has also been argued (see May 1985) to involve one\nthat is multiply interpretable with constrained but not determined\nquantifier scopes. \n\nA standard, but controversial, assumption is that LFs are the input to\nsemantic theory, not the phonological/orthographic objects we hear and\nsee. (see May 1985). Thus, while LFs may not be ambiguous, the\nsentences we actually use and assert often are. If this assumption\nturns out to be false, then it will be a great deal more difficult to\nlocate the source of some ambiguities.\n\nLFs can be represented as trees, and the terminal nodes of the\nbranches are taken from the lexicon. A lexicon is a repository of\nlexical items, which need not look like words and they certainly need\nnot correspond to our intuitions about words. Thus, intuitions about a\nword\u2019s modal profile suggest that it can undergo massive shifts\nin its orthographic and phonetic properties. It is far less clear that\nthe lexemes retain their identity over shifts of phonological\nproperties. We should be a bit careful, then, about the relationship\nbetween words and lexemes: a word may retain its identity while the\nlexeme it is derived from may not constitute it over time.\nFortunately, issues of concerning the diachronic identity of words\nwon\u2019t concern us much here.\n\nThe LF driven picture of semantic interpretation is controversial for\nmany reasons: some people don\u2019t think that LFs are properly\nthought of as inputs to anything, never mind semantic interpretation.\nCulicover and Jackendoff (2005) argue for much less extensive\nsyntactic structures coupled with very messy mappings to semantic (or\n\u2018conceptual\u2019) structures. Others think that most of the\nwork done by LFs could be done by taking a notion of surface syntax\nseriously, trading in syntactic structure for very complicated\nsemantic theories to account for the data. (Bittner 2007, Jacobson\n1999).  Thus, the description of some of the ambiguities as syntactic\nor structural rather than semantic can be somewhat controversial.\nHowever, everyone in the game needs something to serve as the input to\nsemantic interpretation and everyone needs some way to describe those\nstructures (if you don\u2019t, call me and let\u2019s talk about it\u2026) so\nhopefully similar points will hold in your preferred syntactic\nframework. We will highlight some of these controversies where\nnecessary.\n\nOne more clarification: ambiguity is a property of either sentences or\nperhaps the speech acts in which the sentences are used. But ambiguity\nof a sentence or sentences uttered does not necessarily result in\nany unclarity regarding what was expressed or meant by the speaker.\nThere is no guarantee that unambiguous utterances will result in full\nunivocal clear understanding either. In some syntactic contexts, the\nambiguity won\u2019t show up at all: \u2018I want to see you\nduck\u2019 is a case in which the NP interpretation of\n\u2018duck\u2019 is simply unavailable (especially with no comma\nafter \u2018you\u2019). In many cases our best theory predicts\nan ambiguity in the sentence used, without predicting confusion over\nhow the utterance ought to be interpreted. \n",
