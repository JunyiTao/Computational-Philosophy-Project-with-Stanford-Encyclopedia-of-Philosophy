    "main_text": "Analytical Marxism || Structure\n1.2 Structure\n\nThe division of labour internal to analytical Marxism runs between, on\nthe one hand, its (non-Marxist) analytical methods (the\nplural is important), and, on the other, its (Marxist) substantive\nconcerns and normative commitments.\n\nPerhaps the only methodological commitment that analytical Marxists\nshare is a negative one. They deny that there exists a distinctive and\nvaluable Marxist method, one which is both useful\nand exclusive to Marxism (unavailable to non-Marxists).\nAnalytical Marxists adopt non-Marxist mainstream methods whenever and\nwherever appropriate, and they maintain that, to the extent that,\nhistorically speaking, Marxism rejected a range of analytical\nmethods\u2014on the grounds of their putatively non-Marxist\n(\u201cundialectical\u201d or \u201cindividualistic\u201d)\ncharacter\u2014this was to the detriment of Marxism\u2019s\nengagement with its own substantive and normative concerns (G. Cohen\n2000b: xviii).\n\nThe positive methodological commitments of analytical Marxism vary\nsignificantly, and some generalisations\u2014about aspirations to\nprecision, or rigour in argumentation, for instance\u2014are not\nespecially illuminating. That said, characteristic, if not\nconstitutive, preferences, organised by discipline (and associated\nwith Cohen, Elster, and Roemer, respectively) would include: in\nPhilosophy, \u201cthose standards of clarity and rigour\u201d\nassociated with the techniques of logical and linguistic analysis that\npredominated in the Anglophone philosophical world in the twentieth\ncentury (G. Cohen 1978: ix); in Politics, political science treatments\nof action, choice, and strategy, and especially those which utilise\ndecision theory or rational choice theory; and, in Economics, the\nmajor contributions of neoclassical economics, especially the\nmathematical modelling of general equilibrium and cooperative game\ntheory (Roemer 1982). Whether these various methods have much in\ncommon is not certain. Erik Olin Wright suggests that they share: a\ncommitment to conventional scientific norms; an emphasis on the\nimportance of systematic conceptualisation; a concern with\nfine-grained specification of theoretical arguments; and a willingness\nto take the relationship between social processes and the intentional\nactions of individuals seriously (1994: 181\u2013191).\n\nThe substantive concerns of analytical Marxism are broadly shared with\nclassical forms of Marxism. They consequently range widely, but\ncertainly include an interest in: historical explanation, class\nstructure, and exploitation. What is potentially distinctive here is\nthe analytical Marxist treatment of those, and other, classical\nMarxist topics.\n\nThe normative commitments of analytical Marxism are also broadly\nshared with classical forms of Marxism. The status and role of\nnormative commitments in Marxist theory are much argued about, but it\nseems certain that\u2014whatever their preferred\nself-descriptions\u2014Marxists do have characteristic normative\ncommitments. What is potentially distinctive here is that analytical\nMarxists acknowledge this, and see a need for further reflection on\nthe relevant values and commitments. Analytical Marxists typically\nembrace values associated with socialism, such as equality and\ncommunity, and endorse normative claims such as that existing\ncapitalism is flawed, and that some non-capitalist alternative would\nbe preferable.\n\nMore generally, this preliminary division of Marxism into\nelements\u2014some of which can be rejected and others improved\nupon\u2014reveals a further characteristic feature of the\nunderstanding and approach of analytical Marxism. In their various\ncritical reflections on what is living, and what is dead, in classical\nMarxism (see, for instance, Elster 1985), analytical Marxists\ntypically resist treating Marxism as a theoretical entity so\nsystematic that it can only be swallowed, or rejected, as a whole.\n",
