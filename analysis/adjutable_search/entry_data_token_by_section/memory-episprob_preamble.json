Your friend\npresses you: how do you know it really happened? It\u2019s\nnatural to answer that you saw it happen. But that can\u2019t be the\nfull story of how you know. Past seeing, by itself, does not entirely\nexplain present knowing or reasonable believing. When our past\nlearning matters for what we can be confident of in the present,\nsomething connects the two. That something seems to be memory. Memory\nplays some role in our everyday believing, and upon closer inspection\nthat role appears essential. Yet memory is secretive, always\noperating, almost always without our noticing, and often eluding any\neffort to appreciate its workings. Even in philosophy, we take for\ngranted memory\u2019s unflagging efforts. There is some mystery about\nhow it supports good inductive reasoning, for example, though we\nrecognize that good inductive reasoning relies on past\nobservation. And memory is what allows this indispensable relying,\nalmost by magic.\n\nHow does memory help us believe and reason well, if it ever truly\ndoes? What might bottle it up and stop it? This entry surveys\ninfluential answers.\n",
