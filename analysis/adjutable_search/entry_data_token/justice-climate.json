These climatic changes raise a number of issues of\njustice. These include (but are not limited to) the following\n\nHow do we assess the impacts of climate change?\nWhat climate responsibilities do current generations have to\nfuture generations?\nHow should political actors take into account the risks and uncertainties\ninvolved in climate projections?\nWho has what responsibilities to address climate change?\nGiven that there is a limited \u201cgreenhouse gas budget\u201d\nhow should it be distributed?\nWhat constraints should regulate and constrain climate\npolicies?\nGiven high levels of noncompliance with climate responsibilities\nhow should we make trade-offs between competing principles of climate\njustice?\n\n\nBefore considering these normative issues, it is important to\nintroduce some scientific terms. Climate scientists often refer to\n\u201cmitigation\u201d and\n\u201cadaptation\u201d. Mitigation involves either reducing\nthe emission of greenhouse gases or creating greenhouse gas sinks\n(which absorb greenhouse gases), or both. Adaptation involves\nmaking changes to people\u2019s context so that they can cope better\nwith a world undergoing climatic changes. Examples of adaptation might\nbe constructing buildings that can cope better with extreme heat, or\nbuilding seawalls that can cope with storm surges. It is arguable that\nthis typology is incomplete. Suppose that humans do not mitigate by enough so the climate system continues to change; and\nsuppose that human societies also fail to implement the necessary \nadaptation policies and so people are unable to enjoy the kinds of lives to\nwhich they are entitled. Then, many would argue, they are entitled to\ncompensation.\n", "toc": [{"#IsolInte": "1. Isolationism and Integrationism"}, {"#AsseClimImpa": "2. Assessing Climate Impacts"}, {"#InteJust": "3.

Isolationism and Integrationism\n\nIt is helpful to draw attention to a distinction between two\ndifferent ways in which one might approach issues of climate\njustice.\n\nOne approach\u2014Isolationism\u2014holds that it is best to treat\nthe ethical issues posed by climate change in isolation from other\nissues (such as poverty, migration, trade and so forth). The\nisolationist seeks to bracket these other considerations and treat\nclimate change on its own. A second\napproach\u2014Integrationism\u2014holds that it is best to treat the\nethical issues posed by climate change in light of a general theory of\njustice and in conjunction with other issues (such as poverty,\ndevelopment and so on).\n\nSome philosophers have adopted an isolationist approach. Some, for\nexample, propose principles for allocating rights to emit greenhouse\ngases that treat greenhouse gases in isolation from other issues\n (Section 6.2).\n Two related reasons are given for this approach. First, some argue\nthat there is value in simplifying the issue, and since introducing\nthese other concerns would complicate the question it is worth\nbracketing them out. Second, some make a related pragmatic argument\nabout the implications of adopting an integrationist approach for\nreaching agreement in climate negotiations. They argue that insisting\nthat climate justice be pursued in light of a general theory, and in\nconjunction with other issues, would be a recipe for deadlock because\nthere is often deep disagreement about what theory of justice is\ncorrect. For this reason, they propose bracketing out other phenomena\nand treating climate change in isolation (Blomfield 2019: 24;\nGosseries 2005: 283; L. Meyer & Roser 2006: 239).\n\nIn reply, those who favour an integrationist approach tend to offer the\nfollowing considerations. First, they argue that in order to treat\nclimate change in isolation there would need to be something special\nabout it that warranted separate treatment. However, they argue,\nclimate change is not special in this way. For example, it impacts on\nthe same interests (people\u2019s interests in food and water; their\nhealth; their access to land and so on) as other phenomena (such as\nthe distribution of economic resources, poverty and poverty\nalleviation, migration, and trade). Furthermore, they claim that the\nsame distributive principles seem to be salient for climate change as\nthey are for other phenomena. If, for example, one thinks that\nindividuals have human rights to meet their socio-economic needs then\nthis should surely also bear on questions of climate justice too since\nit provides a reason to combat climate change and a reason to\ndistribute responsibilities so that they do not burden the poor and\nvulnerable. Another way of putting this point is that when people\nengage in deliberation about, say, how the costs of tackling climate\nchange should be distributed then\u2014so Integrationists\nclaim\u2014they inescapably end up drawing on more general values\n(such as \u201cpeople have a right to a decent standard of\nliving\u201d or \u201cpeople should be accountable for their\nchoices\u201d) (Caney 2005: 763 & 765\u2013766). If philosophers\neschew Integrationism and they try to answer questions such as\n\u201cwho should bear the burdens of combating climate change?\u201d\nin an isolationist fashion\u2014bracketing out, for example, what\neconomic rights persons have\u2014then, so the argument runs, we end\nup with very counter-intuitive conclusions (Caney 2018b:\n682\u2013684).\n\nWhether this is true or not cannot be fully resolved in advance.\nRather it can only be decided by engaging in a normative analysis of\nclimate change and seeing whether it is borne out.\n\nA second point that those who favour an Integrationist approach might\nmake is that climate change is causally interconnected with a wide\nvariety of other phenomena\u2014such as economic growth, poverty\nreduction, migration, health, trade, natural resource ownership, and\ncultural rights\u2014such that it is artificial to treat it on its\nown. Climate change does not present itself to us as a discrete problem\nthat can be treated separately. Rather it is part and parcel of a\nlarger process. It is an upshot of people\u2019s activity (primarily\nthrough the use of energy) and, as such, it is causally intertwined\nwith economic growth, poverty alleviation, urban design, and land use.\nFurthermore, the effects of climatic change are often mediated through\nother factors such as poverty, existing infrastructures, and the\nresponsiveness of political authorities. They interact with existing\ninequalities and vulnerability, producing what Leichenko and\nO\u2019Brien (2008) term \u201cdouble exposures\u201d. In addition\nto this, the extraction of fossil fuels and the industry built around\nit often directly harm the same interests (such as health and access\nto land) that are harmed by the emission of greenhouse gases. So, from\nthis point of view, it seems artificial to focus on the effect of the\nemissions rather than the whole phenomenon. Finally, the policies\nproposed to tackle climate change themselves affect a wide range of\nother phenomena (impacting on land use, access to food, health,\npoverty alleviation, biodiversity loss, individual liberty, and so\non). Given this any attempt to cordon off climate change and apply\nprinciples of justice to it in isolation seems misguided and\nquixotic.\n\nAs we shall see\u2014especially when we consider the distribution of\nresponsibilities and the application of principles of distributive\njustice to the greenhouse gas budget\u2014it matters a great deal\nwhether one takes an Isolationist or Integrationist perspective.\n\nWith this point duly noted, we can turn to the substantive issues.\n2. Assessing Climate Impacts\n\nOne question of justice that arises is \u201cWhat account of\npersons\u201d interests should be employed to evaluate the impacts of\nclimate change?\u2019 Such an account is needed for several reasons.\nFirst, we need it to design adaptation policies for we need to know\nwhat kind of protection people are entitled to and what interests\nought to be protected. In addition to this, when we are considering\nproposed temperature targets we need to be able to evaluate them, and\nto do this we need to have some account of persons\u2019 interests by\nwhich to compare the different possibilities. For many years the\nappropriate temperature target was assumed by many to be that of\nkeeping the increase in global mean temperatures from pre-industrial\ntimes to below 2\u00b0C. However, some have campaigned for lower\ntargets. This is reflected in the Paris Agreement (2015,\n Other Internet Resources)\n which specified that the target should be \n\n\n[h]olding the increase in the global average temperature to well below\n2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the\ntemperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n(Article 2.1(a)) \n\n\nOthers, by contrast, have argued that higher temperatures are\npermissible. For example, William Nordhaus, a leading climate\neconomist, has argued that if we implement what he deems to be the\n\u201coptimal\u201d climate policy the temperature increase would be\n3.5\u00b0C in 2100 (when compared to a 1900 baseline) (Nordhaus 2018:\n348 Fig 4).\n\nTheories of distributive justice concern the just distribution of\nburdens and benefits. We therefore need to know how we should conceive\nof \u201cburdens\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d. Different\ntheories of distributive justice have put forward different accounts\nof what it is that persons should have fair shares of (the\ndistribuendum) (see entries on\n distributive justice\n and\n egalitarianism).\n\nWhen we consider climate change, different accounts of the\ndistribuendum are highly likely to converge in very many\ncases. Climate change results in many dying (because of severe weather\nevents, such as extreme heatwaves, flooding, and storm surges). It\nleads to droughts and crop failure and thus threatens people\u2019s\ninterests in food and water. It leads to an increase in certain\ndiseases. These impacts\u2014threats to life, food and water, and to\nhealth\u2014would be condemned by many, if not all, theories of\ndistributive justice. (For a detailed discussion of the implications\nof different accounts of the distribuenda of distributive\njustice for the evaluation of climatic impacts see Page [2006:\n50\u201377].)\n\nSome, however, would argue that to limit our focus to these interests\n(in life, health, food and water) is too narrow. They hold that some\npersons have deep attachments to certain places, such as the land that\nthey have traditionally inhabited, and that being rooted in a\nparticular place is an integral part of what makes their life go well.\nOn this view, forcible displacement results in a non-substitutable\nloss. This is highly pertinent in the case of climate change since\nmany indigenous peoples will be forcibly displaced from traditional\nhomelands. This is true both of those in small island states and\ncoastal settlements, as well as of inland communities forced to move\nbecause of environmental degradation to their traditional lands. Many\nargue, on this basis, that climate change constitutes a form of\ncultural injustice (de Shalit 2011, Heyward 2014, Whyte 2016). An\nadequate theory of climate justice must then consider whether\npersons\u2019 have such cultural rights. \n\nThis last example also helps to underscore another important point,\nnamely that which account of persons\u2019 interests is adopted can\nhave considerable practical implications, affecting what temperature\ntarget to employ and what form adaptation should take.\n\nThe key issue here concerns the relationship between persons\u2019\ninterests, on the one hand, and changes in the climate system, on the\nother. On some views people\u2019s interests are such that a change\nin the climate system might\u2014at least in principle\u2014be made\nup for through adaptation and/or through the provision of other goods.\nIf, for example, one thinks that distributive justice is concerned\nsolely with persons\u2019 wealth and income, then the loss of a good\n(such as one\u2019s house) because of climatic changes can be\ncompensated for by a transfer of wealth and/or income.\n\nOther accounts of persons\u2019 interests will not, however, sanction\nthis kind of \u201ccompensation\u201d. Those who think that some\npersons\u2019 good is bound up with a certain place or territory will\nthink that climate change inflicts on such people a loss that cannot\nbe compensated for. Protecting their interests necessarily requires\nthe environment to be a certain way (de Shalit 2011; Heyward 2014 esp.\n156\u2013157; Whyte 2016).\n\nTo put the point in other words, the key concern is about\n\u201csubstitutability\u201d (Neumayer 2003: 37\u201340). The\nquestion is whether one can substitute the loss of nature with the\nprovision of other goods. Different accounts of justice will yield\ndifferent answers to this. This take us to a long-standing debate in\necological economics and ethics between proponents of what has been\ntermed \u201cweak sustainability\u201d (which permits the\nsubstitution of capital for the loss of nature) and proponents of\n\u201cstrong sustainability\u201d (which denies the possibility of\nsuch substitution) (Neumayer 2003).\n\nFour further points are in order.\n\nFirst, it would be a mistake simply to employ an account of the\ndistribuendum and then apply that to evaluate climatic\nimpacts without considering whether that account adequately reflects\nthe values and ethical orientations of affected communities. See, in\nthis context, Krushil Watene\u2019s (2016) evaluation of the extent\nto which the \u201ccapability\u201d approach can accommodate the\ninsights of Maori philosophy concerning the value of nature. (See\nentry on\n capability approach\n for information on the capability approach and relevant sources.)\n\nSecond, it is worth noting that once one has an account of the\nrelevant interests a further question is how one incorporates them\ninto a theory of justice. For example, some have argued that many of\nthe adverse impacts described above can accurately be described as\nthreatening people\u2019s human rights (Caney 2010b). This view\nmaintains that persons have certain human rights\u2014to life,\nhealth, water, food, not to be displaced\u2014and that climate change\nis unjust because it violates these human rights. Others are sceptical\nof the applicability of human rights, arguing that they are too\ninflexible and are unable to provide guidance when trade-offs are\nnecessary (Moellendorf 2014: 24\u201326 & 230\u2013235).\n\nMoellendorf suggests that we should instead adopt what he terms an\n\u201cAntipoverty Principle\u201d: this judges climate impacts (and\nclimate policies) in terms of their impact on poverty (Moellendorf\n2014: 22\u201324). This, however, will be vulnerable to the objection\nthat it is unduly narrow in its focus, for climate change has harmful\neffects that cannot simply be reduced to its effect on poverty levels\n(such as its effects on political self-determination, \npeople\u2019s ability to practise their traditional ways of life, and\ntheir right not to be displaced) (Gardiner 2017: 441\u2013443).\n\nAnother approach would be to follow the practice of many climate\neconomists. They employ what they term the \u201csocial cost of\ncarbon\u201d where this calculates \u201ca monetized value of the\npresent and future damages caused by the emission of a ton of\nCO2\u201d (Fleurbaey et al. 2019: 84). What stance one\nadopts here will, then, depend on one\u2019s more general theory of\njustice and normative public policy.\n\nThird, the focus so far has been on the entitlements of individuals.\nHowever, some will argue that this is too restrictive and that a\ncomprehensive account would include the rights of collective units to\nbe self-determining. The clearest and starkest (but not, of course,\nthe only) illustration of this is the destruction of small island\nstates.\n\nFourth, the focus, so far, has been on the impacts on human beings. On\nsome accounts, this is incomplete for it excludes nonhuman animals\n(Cripps 2013: chapter 4). Clearly, evaluating such claims raises\nquestions that go beyond this entry. The point here is just that if\nthe interests of other creatures are included then this will have\nimplications for the evaluation of climatic impacts.\n3. Intergenerational Justice\n\nThe question of what climate target to aim for will also depend on\nwhat responsibilities members of one generation have to future\ngenerations. The emission of some greenhouse gases can have an impact\nfar into the future. For example, CO2 lasts in the\natmosphere for \u201chundreds of thousands of years\u201d (Allen,\nDube, & Solecki 2019: 64). So while climate change affects large\nnumbers of people alive now, many of the impacts of climate change\nwill fall on future generations. To know what temperature target is\nappropriate it is necessary, then, to have an account of our\nresponsibilities to future generations and to know how much weight, if\nany, to attribute to their interests.\n\nSuch an account is also needed for two further reasons. First, the\nquestion of who should bear the burdens of climate change has an\nintergenerational dimension. Some, for example, have argued that it\nwould be fair to impose some of the costs of mitigating (and adapting\nto) climate change on future generations (Rendall 2011).\n\nFinally, there is a fixed quantity of greenhouse gases which can be\n emitted.[2]\n Considering how this should be shared also raises questions of\nintergenerational justice for if there is a fixed greenhouse gas\nbudget we need to consider what claims, if any, future people have to\nemit greenhouse gases.\n3.1 Principles of Intergenerational Justice\n\nA number of different principles of intergenerational justice have\nbeen proposed. Many for example, adopt a sufficientarian position and\nhold that justice requires merely that all persons be above a certain\nspecified threshold. (For sophisticated analyses see L. Meyer &\nRoser 2009 and Page 2006: 90\u201395; 2007.)\n\nOne challenge for this view will, of course, be determining how to\nspecify this threshold. Many, however, will grant that a sufficiency\ncondition is necessary even if it is hard to specify. Some may though\nquery whether it is sufficient. For example, a sufficientarian view\nwould allow members of one generation to leave future generations\nworse off than them just so long as they are above a certain\nthreshold. This will strike many as too weak. Consider a case where\none generation could leave future people much better off than the\nsufficientarian threshold at no (or little) cost. Here it would seem\ninadequate to say that current generations need only ensure that\nfuture people do not fall beneath the sufficientarian\u2019s\ndesignated threshold.\n\nSome adopt more demanding accounts of intertemporal justice which\navoid these problems. For example, in their book Sustainability\nfor a Warming Planet (2015) Humberto Llavador, John E. Roemer,\nand Joaquim Silvestre defend what they term \u201cgrowth\nsustainability\u201d. They explain it as follows: \n\n\nGrowth sustainability (say, at 25% per generation) means to find that\npath of economic activity that maximizes the welfare of the present\ngeneration, subject to guaranteeing that welfare grows at least at 25%\nper generation, forever after. (Llavador, Roemer & Silvestre 2015:\n4) \n\n\nThe key idea is to maximise the standard of living of current\ngenerations but also commit to leaving future people better off by a\ncertain proportion. Their argument comes in two steps. First, they\nthink\u2014along luck egalitarian lines\u2014that there is a case\nfor intergenerational equality. But then they add that current\ngenerations often desire to benefit the future and so there is a case\nfor building in a commitment to bettering the condition of future\npeople (Llavador, Roemer & Silvestre 2015: 4 &\n35\u201336).\n\nOthers might query this second step, and, in particular, the claim\nthat a \u201cpreference\u201d to benefit others can ground an\n(enforceable) duty to do so. In general, whether people have a duty to\nothers cannot be vindicated on the basis of a preference that some\nhave to benefit others. This notwithstanding, some might still argue\nthat where current generations can leave future generations better off\nthan themselves at no cost, or at reasonable cost, then there is a\nduty to do so.\n\nThere is one other aspect that bears mentioning. So far the focus has\nbeen on what might term a vertical dimension (how well off the members\nof generations in the future [at, say, t10] are when\ncompared to earlier generations [at, say, t1]). This\ndoes not, however, exhaust questions of intergenerational justice for\none might think that members of one generation should also be\nconcerned about the likely distribution within any future\ngeneration (so, what we might term a horizontal dimension). Those who\nadopt an egalitarian perspective, for example, might think that\ncurrent generations have a duty to act in such a way that they do not\ncreate stark inequalities within future generations (Caney\n2018a: 161\u2013162 & 168; see also Fleurbaey et al. 2019: 93).\nThis is relevant in this context because climate change tends to\nexacerbate existing inequalities (Hoegh-Guldberg, Jacob, & Taylor\n2019: 244).\n3.2 Intertemporal Discounting\n\nThe focus of the previous subsection was on principles of\nintergenerational justice. Much of the literature on intergenerational\njustice and climate change has, however, engaged with economic\nanalyses of the impacts of climate change, and economic analyses tend\nto employ the concept of a social discount rate to specify how people\nshould treat future generations. Given this a comprehensive treatment\nof climate justice and future generations needs to discuss the concept\nof discounting (see entry on\n Frank Ramsey and intergenerational welfare economics).\n \n\nRoughly stated, social discount rates specify the extent to which\npersons should \u201cdiscount\u201d the future and should allocate\nresources to the current time as opposed to the future. The social\ndiscount rate has several component parts.\n\nTime Discounting. One important component is \u201ctime\ndiscounting\u201d: this involves allocating less moral weight to a\nperson\u2019s well-being the further into the future it is. Many\nphilosophers have been highly critical of this approach, arguing that\nit is objectionable to discriminate against people on the basis of\nwhen they are alive. That, it is argued, penalises people for a\nproperty that lacks any moral significance (Caney 2014b:\n323\u2013327; Parfit 1984: 480\u2013486; Rawls 1999: 259\u2013262).\nOthers would demur, and some have offered communitarian defences of\nspecial obligations to those who are temporally near (de Shalit\n1995).\n\nGrowth Discounting. A second important component is what\nNordhaus calls \u201cgrowth discounting\u201d (1997: 317). The idea\nhere is clearly stated by the economist Nicholas Stern, who writes\nthat we \n\n\nshould discount the consumption of future generations on the basis\nthat they are likely to be richer than ourselves. This reason for\ndiscounting is, and should be, part of most models. (Stern 2008: 14)\n\n\n\nClearly what position one takes on this will depend on whether one\nadopts a broadly egalitarian position on intergenerational justice or\nnot. If one thinks that egalitarian commitments should inform our\npolicies towards future generations, and, if one thinks that those\nalive in the future will be wealthier (a crucial assumption that one\nmight at least query) then there is a case for growth discounting. So\none\u2019s verdict on growth discounting will depend on the nature of\none\u2019s principle of intergenerational justice (sufficiency,\nequality, priority, Llavador et al.\u2019s formulation and so on) as\nwell as empirical assumptions about future growth (and one\u2019s\nattitude to risk and uncertainty).\n3.3 Objections and Concerns\n\nThe previous subsections proceeded on the basis that there are duties\nof justice to future generations. It is worth noting here then that\nsome dispute that. The reasons they do so are not peculiar to the case\nof climate change, and are familiar from general debates about\nintergenerational justice (see entry on\n intergenerational justice).\n\nFor example, some have invoked Derek Parfit\u2019s Non Identity\nProblem (Parfit 1984: chapter 16) to call into question claims that\nthere are duties of justice to (remote) future generations (Broome\n2012: 61\u201364). They argue that since the decisions made now\naffect who gets born in the future they do not harm future generations\nfor they do not make them worse off than they would otherwise be\n(Broome 2012: 61\u201364; Parfit 1984: chapter 16).\n\nThis is not the place to discuss the Non Identity Problem in depth\n(see entry on\n nonidentity problem).\n It is, however, perhaps worth noting that many are not persuaded that\nthis argument shows that current generations lack duties of (climate)\njustice to future people. The nub of the issue is whether theories of\njustice are committed to a \u201cnarrow person-affecting\u201d point\nof view (Parfit 1984: 393\u2013395). Broome appears to assume that\nthey are. However, many others maintain that justice to future\ngenerations should not be conceived of in such narrow person-affecting\nterms (e.g., Reiman 2007: esp. 83\u201386 & 88\u201392).\nConsider, for example, sufficientarian accounts of our\nresponsibilities to the future. They maintain that there is a duty of\njustice to act in such a way that the standard of living of those who\nlive in the future is above a certain threshold. They are not\ncommitted to the thought that persons act unjustly only if\nthey render someone (future or present) worse off than they would\notherwise have been. Their claim is simply that persons of one\ngeneration act unjustly if, other things being equal, the outcome of\ntheir actions is that those who are alive in the future have a\nlower-than-sufficiency standard of living (see the entry on\n intergenerational justice,\n sections 3 & 4). The same point could be made about other\naccounts, whether egalitarian, prioritarian or Llavador et al.\u2019s\nview. \n4. Risk and Uncertainty\n\nAnother set of normative issues arises from the fact that climate\nprojections are characterised by risk and uncertainty. A comprehensive\nanalysis of climate justice needs, then, to consider the just way to\nrespond to risk and uncertainty. To underscore why this matters it is\nsalutary to consider the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report. Suppose\nthat we take the appropriate target to be avoiding an increase in\nglobal mean temperatures of more than 1.5\u00b0C when compared with\npre-industrial times. The quantity of greenhouse gases that can be\npermissibly emitted varies enormously depending on how risk-averse we\nthink that our approach should be. According to the IPCC a 33%\nprobability of meeting the 1.5\u00b0C target results in a greenhouse\ngas budget of 840 GtCO2 whereas a 66% probability of\nmeeting the same target results in a greenhouse budget of 420\nGtCO2 (Rogelj, Shindell, & Jiang 2019: 108). If we opt\nfor the more risk averse approach, then, the volume of greenhouse\ngases than can be permissibly emitted is half the size that the budget\nwould be if we opt for the less risk averse approach. One\nquestion that arises then is: How risk-averse should we be? How should\npolicy-makers treat risk and uncertainty?\n\nTwo approaches have been adopted.\n\nFirst, some employ traditional cost-benefit analysis and seek to\nderive the \u201cexpected value\u201d of different scenarios by\ncombining the probability of each state of affairs and its value and\nthen choosing that policy with the greatest expected value (Broome\n2012: 120\u2013132). Fleurbaey et al. (2019: 97\u2013100) provide an\nexcellent short analysis of this approach and variants of it. Some\nquery the validity of the \u201cexpected value\u201d approach on the\nbasis that our understanding of the future is so imperfect that we\nlack reliable probabilities (Gardiner 2011: 261\u2013263; though see\nBroome 2012: 127\u2013129).\n\nSecond, some adopt a version of the \u201cprecautionary\nprinciple\u201d. To introduce this principle it is helpful to turn to\nNeil Manson\u2019s excellent analysis of the precautionary principle\n(Manson 2002). Manson argues that all formulations of the\nprecautionary principle contain three elements. In particular they\ninclude what he terms \u201ca damage condition\u201d (this states\nwhat kinds of bad outcomes are relevant), a \u201cknowledge\ncondition\u201d (this states what kind of epistemic conditions are\nrequired\u2014is it uncertainty or a certain level of risk?) and a\n\u201cremedy\u201d (this states the right response) (Manson 2002:\n265). The central idea is that when people are engaged in a certain\nkind of action in which there is a prospect of harms of the relevant\nkind, and when our understanding of whether the harms will materialise\nsatisfies the knowledge condition, then it is appropriate to adopt a\nprecautionary policy (Manson 2002: esp. 265). Clearly, however, a\ngreat deal of work is needed to specify the three core\nfeatures\u2014how much harm and what kind of harm is relevant?; what\nepistemic conditions must hold?; what course of action is required\n(Manson 2002: 267)? \n\nIn his illuminating analysis of the precautionary principle Gardiner\nalso identifies three essential features. There is a \u201cthreat of\nharm\u201d; there is \u201c[u]ncertainty of impact and\ncausality\u201d; and third there is a \u201cprecautionary\nresponse\u201d (Gardiner 2006: 36). \n\nNow some interpretations of the basic idea will be unduly risk averse\n(Gardiner 2006: 37). Gardiner himself draws on Rawls\u2019s use of\nmaximin, and argues that we should prioritise avoiding very bad\noutcomes when the following conditions are all satisfied: (1) people face options with a variety of different outcomes (including some potentially dire ones) but cannot ascertain the probabilities of these outcomes so are in a state of \nuncertainty, (2) people do not care greatly about how much they are\nbetter off than \u201cthe minimum that can be guaranteed by the\nmaximin approach\u201d, and (3) people care greatly about not falling\nbeneath that minimum (Gardiner 2006: 47 & more generally\n45\u201349). Under such circumstances, Gardiner argues, it would not\nmake sense to take the risk of a dire outcome.\n\nA related (though not identical) approach is adopted by Shue, who\ndraws on Gardiner and Manson. Shue, like Gardiner, invokes three\nconditions. These are as follows:\n\n\n(1) massive loss: the magnitude of the possible losses is\nmassive; (2) threshold likelihood: the likelihood of the\nlosses is significant, even if no precise probability can be\nspecified, because (a) the mechanism by which the losses would occur\nis well understood, and (b) the conditions for the functioning of the\nmechanism are accumulating; and (3) non-excessive costs: the\ncosts of prevention are not excessive (a) in light of the magnitude of\nthe possible losses and (b) even considering the other important\ndemands on our resources. (Shue 2014: 265; footnote omitted) \n\n\nShue\u2019s claim, then, is that \n\n\n[w]here these three features are all present, one ought to try\nurgently to make the outcome progressively more unlikely until the\nmarginal costs of further efforts become excessive, irrespective of\nthe outcome\u2019s precise prior probability, which may not be known\nin any case. (Shue 2014:\n 265)[3]\n\n\nNote that the \u201cexpected value\u201d and the\n\u201cprecautionary\u201d approaches disagree, at a fundamental\nlevel, about the relevance of probabilities. The first one relies on\nthem to derive expected values, whereas the second does not rely on\nprecise probabilities. (Indeed, Gardiner\u2019s approach is intended\nto apply to cases of \u201cuncertainty\u201d [which is when we\ncannot specify probabilities] Gardiner [2006: 50].) This said, it\nseems likely that in practice they will converge, at least to some\nextent, in calling for aggressive mitigation policies.\n5. Responsibilities\n\nSuppose that we have identified what kinds of interests should be\nincluded in a theory of justice, what responsibilities persons owe to\nfuture people, and how to treat risk and uncertainty. These can guide\nus in determining what goals we should aim for. The next question to\nask is \u2018Who has what responsibilities to meet\nthese goals?\u2019 It is helpful to break this question down into several\nparts. We can identify four further questions, which together would\nenable us to answer this question and tell us what would be a just\ndistribution of climate responsibilities.\n\nFirst, it is important to be clear on the content of the\nresponsibilities. As noted at the start, climate scientists and\npolicy-makers focus primarily (though not exclusively) on two kinds of\npolicies\u2014mitigation and adaptation. The first question, then, is\n\u201cWho should engage in mitigation and adaptation, and to what\nextent?\u201d Let us call this the Climate Action Question.\n\nA second question is \u201cWho should bear the costs of mitigation\nand adaptation?\u201d Mitigation will often involve economic (and\nother) types of cost. For example, if a carbon tax is levied on goods\nthen purchasers of those goods will be financially worse off.\nSometimes mitigation policies come with benefits (for example,\nregulations discouraging car use are likely to improve air quality;\nencouraging people to cycle rather than drive may improve physical\nfitness). In many cases, however, the policies come with a cost.\nLikewise adaptation policies (such as designing cities to cope better\nwith heatwaves) will come at a cost. Who should pay for these? Let us\ncall this the Burden-Sharing Question.\n\nA third question is Who has the responsibility to ensure that (a)\nthose designated to engage in mitigation and adaptation do so and (b)\nthose designated to bear any financial burdens discharge their\nresponsibilities? Let us call this the Political Action Question.\n\nThe fourth question is rather different in kind. It asks, for all of\nthe previous questions, what kinds of entities are the duty-bearers?\nMany will assume that governments have such responsibilities, but what\nabout other actors? Are individuals duty-bearers? For example, do\nindividuals have duties to engage in mitigation? Or does that duty\nfall exclusively on other actors?\n5.1 The Climate Action Question\n\nConsider the first two questions. Very often these are treated\ntogether, but they are not necessarily the same. One might think, for\nexample, that one agent has a responsibility to mitigate (on the\ngrounds that doing so would be an effective way of making a\nsignificant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) but that others\nhave a duty to bear some, or all, of the costs. In such a case, then,\nour answer to the Climate Action Question might be that X should\nmitigate, but our answer to the Burden-Sharing Question might be that\nY should bear the cost involved in X\u2019s mitigating.\nTo illustrate: one might think that developing countries should\nmitigate and should use clean technology instead of fossil fuels, but\none might also think that the cost of the clean technology should be\nshouldered by others.\n\nTo give another illustration: one might think that current generations\nshould mitigate climate change aggressively but that they can pass on\nsome of the costs of doing so to future generations (Rendall 2011). (A\nversion of this position is defended by Broome [2012: 47\u201348],\nand is introduced\n below\u2014Section 8.)\n\nOf course, even though the questions are distinct this does not entail\nthat they should be treated wholly separately. One might think, for\nexample, that X should mitigate but only if others pay at least\nsome (or even all) of the costs, and that if sufficient financial\nsupport is not forthcoming then X is not obligated. With this\nin mind, it is appropriate to turn to the Burden-Sharing Question. A\nconsiderable literature has developed around the question of who\nshould bear the costs of combating climate change.\n5.2 The Burden-Sharing Question\n\nThree principles, in particular, have emerged.\n5.2.1 The Polluter Pays Principle\n\nOne principle commonly referred to as the Polluter Pays Principle holds that\nburdens should be borne in proportion to how much an agent has emitted\n(Shue 2014: 182\u2013186). This is an intuitively plausible approach. It\nreflects a widely held principle about responsibility, namely\nthat we can, subject to certain conditions, hold agents responsible\nfor their actions.\n\nThis noted, there are several complications. First, some argue that it\nis unfair to hold agents responsible for the harms resulting from\ntheir emission of greenhouse gases if they were excusably ignorant of\nthe impact of their actions. They then argue that many of those who\nhave emitted greenhouse gases in the past were excusably ignorant and\nso cannot be held liable.\n\nSeveral replies have been given to this line of argument.\nFirst, on an empirical note, we can respond that for several decades\nnow people could not plausibly claim to be excusably ignorant about\nthe effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Of course, specifying\nprecisely when one could no longer claim to be excusably ignorant will\nbe hard, but the salient point is that there are limits to the extent\nto which one can plead excusable ignorance (Singer 2002:\n 34).[4]\n Second, some argue that it can be fair to ascribe burdens to those\nwho were excusably ignorant of the harms of their emissions if those\nwho emitted benefited sufficiently from the emissions. The rough\nthought here is that while someone might reasonably complain that it\nis unfair to penalise them for non-culpably contributing to harm,\ntheir case is considerably weakened if it is also the case that the\nharmful activity also created benefits for them. If they have\nbenefited then making them pay would not be so onerous and might even\nleave them no worse off than if they had they not emitted. (For\ndiscussion of the \u201cexcusable ignorance\u201d objection and\nresponses to it see Gosseries [2004: 39\u201341].)\n\nA second challenge draws attention to the fact that many emitters are\nno longer alive. Why, the objection goes, should those alive now foot\nthe bill for the acts of previous generations? Again responses have\nbeen forthcoming. Some may adopt a collectivist approach and hold that\nthe relevant agents are collective bodies like states, and so they\nhold that since country X emitted in the past country X\nshould pay now. Some, by contrast, respond by appealing again to the\nidea of benefiting. They hold that individuals alive today (and in the\nfuture) enjoy benefits that result from previous emissions-generating\nactivities and so have a duty to pay at least some of the costs\nincurred in their production. (For discussion see Neumayer [2000: 189], Shue [2014: 186] and\nGosseries [2004: 41\u201355].)\n\nThere is a third challenge. What if persons need to engage in\nactivities which emit greenhouse gases in order to enjoy a decent\nminimum standard of living? Many hold that it is unfair to make\nextremely poor people pay the cost of emitting greenhouse gases where\ndoing so would push them beneath a decent standard of living. More\ngenerally, one might argue that if people are entitled to a certain\nstandard of living (which need not be specified according to\nsufficientarian criteria, but could also be specified according to\negalitarian or prioritarian or some other criteria) then it would be\nwrong to make them pay if doing so entails that they cannot enjoy that\nstandard of living.\n\nIt is worth noting here that if one does think that the existing\nglobal poor should not be required to bear the costs of their\nemissions then this might also be relevant for one\u2019s assessment\nof rich countries\u2019 past emissions. For if developing countries\nnow should not be financially penalised for the emissions that they\nincur when seeking to develop then should not the same be said of the\nemissions incurred by (now affluent) countries when they were also\npoor?\n5.2.2 The Beneficiary Pays Principle\n\nIn light of these kinds of challenges many hold that the Polluter Pays\nPrinciple should be supplemented by other principles. As we have seen\nin the previous subsection some appeal to what has been termed the\nBeneficiary Pays Principle. This holds that agents should pay because,\nand to the extent that, they have benefited from the activities that\ninvolve the emission of greenhouse gases (Page 2012).\n\nThis approach faces a number of questions. One concerns which\nemissions come under its remit. Does it just cover cases that the\nPolluter Pays Principle cannot deal with (e.g., the emissions of the\nprevious generations) (Duus-Otterstr\u00f6m 2014)? Or does it have wider applicability?\n\nSecond, one might query whether benefiting is always sufficient to\nrender someone liable to pay. Someone may, for example, benefit from\nemissions and yet remain very poor. If one thinks that the Polluter\nPays Principle should not be applied in cases where it would push\nsomeone beneath a decent standard of living then one might, for the\nsame reason, think that the Beneficiary Pays Principle is similarly\nconstrained.\n\nNote that if this reasoning is correct it supports the Integrationist\napproach outlined in\n Section 1,\n for it suggests that when answering who should pay one should not\nbracket out more general considerations such as what rights, if any,\npersons have to enjoy a certain standard of living (such as an\n\u201cequal standard of living\u201d or a \u201cminimum standard of\nliving\u201d).\n5.2.3 The Ability to Pay Principle\n\nThis takes us to a third proposed principle. Some have argued that any\nburdens incurred by mitigation and adaptation should be distributed\naccording to agents\u2019 ability to pay. This principle is widely\ninterpreted to mean that the greater an agent\u2019s ability to pay\nthe greater the proportion of the cost that they should be expected to\npay (Shue 2014: 186\u2013189; Moellendorf 2014: esp.\n173\u2013180).\n\nOne criticism of this principle is that it wholly divorces the\nquestion of who pays from questions about who caused the problem or\nwho benefited from causing the problem. In addition to this, some\nargue that it relies on controversial moral assumptions, namely that\nthe wealthy have a positive duty of assistance (Duus-Otterstr\u00f6m\n2014: 451\u2013452).\n\nWhere one stands on the Ability to Pay Principle is likely to depend\non one\u2019s overall account of (global) distributive justice. For\nexample, those who think that global justice requires a more equal\nworld will, other things being equal, endorse a proposal that the\ncosts should be borne primarily by the most advantaged and not by the\nworld\u2019s poorest.\n\n(For further discussion of these three principles and the above\nobjections to them, see Caney 2005, 2010a.)\n5.3 The Political Action Question and First-Order and Second-Order Responsibilities\n\nAlthough much of the literature has focused on who should pay, there\nis another set of questions concerning responsibilities. To approach\nit, it is useful to distinguish between first-order and second-order\nresponsibilities, where a first-order responsibility in this context\nis a responsibility either (a) to mitigate climate change or\nfacilitate adaptation or (b) to bear the costs of mitigation or\nadaptation or both. A second-order responsibility, in this context, is\na responsibility to take action that ensures that others comply with\ntheir first-order (climate) responsibilities. (The distinction between\nfirst- and second-order responsibilities is made by Onora\nO\u2019Neill [2005: 428 & 433\u2013436] and is applied to the\ncase of climate change by Caney [2014a: 134\u2013147].) Second-order\nresponsibilities are responsibilities to change the social, economic\nand political environment so that agents comply with their first-order\nresponsibilities. They can include, for example,\ndisincentivising carbon-intensive options (through, say,\ncarbon taxes or quotas or mandatory regulations) thereby inducing\nagents to comply with a first-order responsibility to mitigate. Or\nthey can involve incentivising others to discharge their\nmitigation responsibilities by, for example, subsidising\nclean sources of energy or by designing the urban environment so that\npeople are more likely to walk or cycle or use public transport rather\nthan drive.\n\nA similar idea is advanced by Elizabeth Cripps who refers to what she\nterms \u201cpromotional duties\u201d (2013: 116 & chapter 6\n[esp. 140\u2013150]). These are \u201c[d]uties to attempt to bring\nabout the necessary collective action\u201d (2013: 116). What actions\nmight these involve? Cripps considers the promotional duties of\nindividuals and suggests that these involve campaigning, running for\nelection, signing petitions, sending letters to politicians, giving\nmoney to environmental organisations, and going on marches (2013:\n143). Walter Sinnott-Armstrong also suggests that citizens have a duty\nto campaign for their governments to implement climate legislation\n(2010: 344). One might also add to this list of second-order\nresponsibilities, duties to engage in civil disobedience and\nresistance against laws that result in unjustified emissions or\ninadequate levels of adaptation.\n\nTwo further points are worth noting. First, much of the focus has been\non what we might term \u201cpositive\u201d second-order\nresponsibilities. They are \u201cpositive\u201d because they require\nagents to take action. Given the arguments above, however, we also\nhave good reason to think that there are \u201cnegative\u201d\nsecond-order responsibilities as well. Whereas a positive second-order\nduty is a duty to take steps to ensure that others comply with their\nfirst-order responsibilities, a negative second-order duty would be a\nduty not to thwart or undermine initiatives to tackle climate change.\nThis is relevant given the argument that some organisations\u2014most\nnotably fossil fuel companies and electric utilities companies, as\nwell as some labour organisations\u2014have gone to considerable\nlengths to undermine attempts to combat climate change (Mildenberger\n2020; Oreskes & Conway 2010: chapter 6; Stokes 2020).\n\nSecond, the focus of many of those philosophers mentioned above has\nbeen on political institutions. While institutions are necessary they\nare likely to be insufficient. To arrive at a systematic and\ncomprehensive account of agents\u2019 second-order responsibilities\nit is worth starting with a political, social and economic analysis of\nwhy agents are not discharging responsibilities to mitigate and adapt.\nIf we start with this we can then work back from it and identify what\nneeds to be done by whom to bring about the necessary change. This is\nhighly likely to involve changing ideologies (for example, those that\nfoster fossil-fuel-driven growth), cultural practices, and social\nnorms, as well as institutions.\n5.4 Who are the Duty Bearers?\n\nWe can turn now to the fourth question. What kind of agent is the\nduty-bearer?\n\nIt is helpful here to focus on responsibilities to mitigate since\nthere has been considerable debate among philosophers as to whether\nindividuals have responsibilities to limit their own personal\nemissions or not. Some, like Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, are sceptical\nof the proposition that individuals have duties to limit their own\nemissions. He considers a large number of separate commonsense moral\nprinciples and argues that none of these can be marshalled to show\nthat individuals have a duty to limit their own emissions. One central\ntheme in his argument is that individuals\u2019 personal emissions\nmake no difference (Sinnott-Armstrong 2010).\n\nTwo kinds of response have been made to these kinds of arguments. The\nfirst disputes the claim that individuals make no difference. Avram\nHiller argues that \n\n\nit is prima facie wrong to perform an act which has an\nexpected amount of harm greater than another easily available\nalternative (Hiller 2011: 352) \n\n\nand argues that individual emissions, while small, violate this\nprinciple. Similarly, Broome argues that individuals\u2019 emissions\ncreate \u201cexpected harm\u201d and they have a duty not to do so\n(Broome 2019). John Nolt argues in the same vein, and calculates the\nimpact of a North Americans\u2019 emissions over their lifetime (Nolt\n2011).\n\nA second response would be to appeal to a different kind of principle.\nFor example, one might argue that we have a duty not to participate in\ncollective processes which generate unjust outcomes. To do so would be\nstand in the wrong kind of relationship to such collective processes.\nSuch a reply might seek to build on the work on\n\u201ccomplicity\u201d by Christopher Kutz (2000). In addition to a\nnegative duty not to participate in such destructive processes one\nmight also argue, as Tracy Isaacs has done, for a duty of individuals\nin \u201ccollective contexts\u201d to form associations and create\nsocial forces for change (Isaacs 2011: chapter 5 esp.\n144\u2013155).\n\nOne further comment is in order. As noted above, while\nSinnott-Armstrong believes that individuals do not have a moral\nresponsibility to limit their emissions he does believe that\nindividuals have political responsibilities to vote and to pressurise\ntheir representatives to pass climate legislation. As Hiller notes,\nthis position may be unstable. The reasons\nSinnott-Armstrong gives as to why individuals do not have mitigation\nresponsibilities (their actions are inconsequential) would, if\ncorrect, also seem to establish that they do not have political\nresponsibilities either. For one person\u2019s vote is also almost\ncertainly inconsequential (Hiller 2011: 364\u2013365).\n\nTo sum up, then, if we consider who has what\nresponsibilities to address climate change, it is helpful to\ndistinguish between four questions. First, who should engage in\nmitigation and adaptation? Second, who should bear any cost involved\nin mitigation and adaptation? Third, who has the responsibility to\nensure that the relevant duty bearers for questions 1 and 2 discharge\ntheir responsibilities? Finally, for each of the above we need to know\n\u201cwhat kind of agent is being ascribed duties?\u201d\n6. Justice and the Greenhouse Gas Budget\n\nOne critical responsibility is to limit the emission of greenhouse\ngases. Many hold that, at the moment, some greenhouse gases can\nnonetheless be permissibly emitted. There is, then, a question about\nhow the use of the remaining \u201cgreenhouse gas budget\u201d can\nbe distributed and among whom. As we have seen the size of the budget\ndepends in part on what temperature target is selected and how risk\naverse we think we should be. To illustrate: the Fifth Assessment\nReport of the IPCC reported that if we want to have a probability of\nat least 67% of avoiding a more than 1.5\u00b0C increase in global mean\ntemperatures then there is a budget of approximately 420\nGtCO2 (Rogelj, Shindell, & Jiang 2019: 108). (If we\noperate with a less ambitious target then the budget is quite\ndifferent. See table 2.2 in Rogelj, Shindell, & Jiang [2019:\n108].)\n\nOne key question then is, \u201cHow should this budget be\nshared?\u201d What principles of distributive justice should be\napplied to this \u201cgood\u201d?\n6.1 Subsistence\n\nOne approach put forward by Henry Shue argues that rights to emit\ngreenhouse gases should be distributed so as to meet peoples\u2019\n\u201csubsistence\u201d needs, and that such emissions should take\npriority over \u201cluxury\u201d emissions (Shue 2014: chapter 2).\nThe focus on meeting basic needs here seems hard to dispute. Many\nphilosophers and environmental campaigners have, however, argued that\nequality should be the guiding principle\u2014and not subsistence (or\nnot merely subsistence).\n6.2 Equality\n\nMany, that is, have endorsed what we might call the \u201cequal\nper capita\u201d view. This holds that rights to emit\ngreenhouse gases should be distributed equally. An important and\ninfluential statement of this position was affirmed by Anil Agarwal\nand Sunita Narain in Global Warming in an Unequal World\n(1991). They start from the premise that the atmosphere is part of the\n\u201cglobal commons\u201d (see also Shiva 2016). They infer from\nthis that it should be divided equally among all human beings. As they\nput it:\n\n\nThe question is how should this global common\u2014the global carbon\ndioxide and methane sinks\u2014be shared amongst the people of the\nworld? \u2026 [I]n a world that aspires to such lofty ideals like\nglobal justice, equity and sustainability, this vital global common\nshould be shared equally on a per capita basis. (Agarwal\n& Narain 1991: 9) \n\n\nSimilar positions have been taken by Dale Jamieson (2010:\n272\u2013273), and Steve Vanderheiden (2008: 107\u2013109 &\nchapter 7 [esp. 226\u2013227]). Peter Singer (2002: 43\u201344) has\nalso argued for it for partly moral and partly pragmatic reasons.\n\nBefore noting objections, it is worth observing that that the\n\u201cequal per capita view\u201d encompasses a family of\nviews and that one might distinguish between many different versions\nof this view. For example, one version holds that countries\nshould be ascribed rights to emit greenhouse gases and that the size of their quota should vary in line with the number of people in their society\n(Agarwal & Narain 1991: 9\u201310). However, one might interpret\nit in a more individualistic way, and ascribe equal rights to emit to each\nindividual.\n\nIn addition to this, there are different ways of treating past (and\ncurrent) emissions. Some, for example, hold that countries have\nemission rights and that a country\u2019s past emissions should be\ndebited from its quota (Neumayer 2000: esp. 186). Others suggest\ndisregarding past emissions and favour applying the equal per\ncapita emissions approach to the remaining budget (Singer 2002:\n43\u201344; Vanderheiden 2008: 229\u2013230). Still others argue\nthat we should phase in the equal per capita view gradually\nover time, and hence high emitters now will have more-than-equal\nemission rights at the start of the transition period, with their\nshare decreasing until it reaches equality (A. Meyer 2000).\n\nA number of different objections might be levelled against the equal\nper capita view (in all versions). First, some query why it\nis appropriate to treat this good in isolation. The equal per\ncapita view is a paradigm case of an isolationist position.\nHowever, theories of distributive justice tend to focus on the fair\ndistribution of a total package of goods (Bell 2008: esp. 250; Caney\n2012: 265\u2013271; Miller 2008: 142\u2013143). Of course,\nsometimes, in special cases, we do treat goods (e.g., rights to vote)\nin isolation, but it is not at all clear why that reasoning should\napply to this case and it is arguable that in these other cases they\nare grounded in a more general integrationist theory.\n\nSecond, it is worth asking why we should care about emissions at all.\nIn themselves they do not matter to the people who generate them or\nwho enjoy the goods and services whose production involves greenhouse\ngas emissions. They matter because they are a by-product of activities\nthat people engage in to serve important human interests. More\nspecifically they largely arise because of energy use (for building,\nheating, cooling, transporting, manufacturing, lighting and so on) and\nbecause of agriculture and land use change. Given this it makes sense\nto focus on protecting and promoting these interests (bearing in mind,\nof course, limits to emissions) not the distribution of emissions\nin themselves. Suppose, for example, that we compare two people, and\nlet us suppose that both enjoy whatever one takes to be the fair\ndistribution of goods overall. Suppose, for simplicity\u2019s sake,\nthat that is an equal standard of living. Suppose, however, that one\nmeets her interests through fossil fuels and the other through solar\nenergy, it is hard to see why that is necessarily unfair to the second\nperson. True they emit less. But that is irrelevant given that they\nenjoy what is, ex hypothesi, the fair standard of living\n(Hayward 2007: 432\u2013433 & 440\u2013444; Caney 2012:\n285\u2013291). In short: to care about emissions is not to care about\nwhat really matters from the point of view of justice.\n\nIt is worth noting that this objection tells not only against\nthe equal per capita view. It has force against all theories of distributive justice that\ntreat the right to emit as a distribuendum. It would, for example,\nbe an objection to the \u201csubsistence emissions\u201d approach\noriginally pioneered by Shue (Hayward 2007).\n\nThere is a third problem with treating emissions as an appropriate\ndistribuendum. The problem is that a dilemma arises when we\nconsider our responsibilities to future generations. There seem to be\nseveral options. Option 1 would be to deny that there are duties of\njustice to future generations to ensure that they too have rights to\nemit greenhouse gases. Perhaps someone might hold that there are no\nduties of justice at all to them (1a). Or they might hold that there\nare but that they do not include leaving them rights to emit (1b).\n(1a) seems implausible in light of the points made in\n Section 3;\n and (1b) adopts a discriminatory attitude to future people that\nstands in need of moral justification.\n\nA second option is to think that future people have rights and hence\nthat, on the view under consideration, they too have an equal right to\nemit greenhouse gases. If, however, one thinks that all current and\nfuture persons are entitled to equal per capita emissions\nthen we face two severe problems. (i) It will be exceptionally\ndifficult, if not impossible, to calculate how much everyone is\nentitled to. Furthermore, (ii), given the number of future and present\npeople included the equal per capita share would surely be\nclose to zero.\n\nIn light of these problems a better way forward would be not\nto focus on emissions per se, but rather to focus on meeting\npeople\u2019s interests in food and energy and so on, and to draw on\nother safe sources to meet these needs. What is imperative is to\ntransition away from a carbon-based economy towards one not dependent\non fossil fuels. Only in this way we can avoid the dilemma set out\nabove.\n7. Justice and Climate Policies\n\nA further set of normative questions arises when we turn to consider\nwhat policies might be adopted to mitigate (and adapt to) climate\nchange. Many policies that have been recommended or adopted themselves\nraise questions of justice. We can see this by considering three\npolicy areas.\n7.1 Mitigation and Alternative Energy Sources\n\nThe first concerns other energy sources. In practice these can raise\nquestions of justice. For example, the construction of hydroelectric\nplants can lead to the displacement of peoples from their homes and\nindigenous peoples from their traditional homelands. The use of\nbiofuels can lead to increased food prices as crops are devoted to\nproducing fuel. The use of nuclear energy can lead to health risks.\nThe salient point here is that mitigation (and adaptation) policies\nmay raise ethical questions.\n\nHow should one address these? One suggestion would be that we should\ndraw on the same principles and values that one employs to evaluate climate\nimpacts. So, if, for example, one thinks that climate change is unjust\nin part because it undermines the. enjoyment of individual human\nrights then it would seem to follow that one should seek to implement\nmitigation (and adaptation) policies that honour these individual\nhuman rights. And, if one thinks climate change is unjust, in part,\nbecause it undermines the cultural rights of indigenous peoples then,\nagain, it would seem to follow one should seek to implement mitigation\n(and adaptation) policies that honour these. One\u2019s answer to the\nchallenges posed by the harmful side-effects of some mitigation\npolicies would then be part of one\u2019s overall theory.\n7.2 Population\n\nSome philosophers have argued that a commitment to preventing\ndangerous climate change requires adopting policies designed to limit\nor reduce world population size (Cafaro 2012; Cripps 2015). Their\nargument is that population growth is one of the main factors\ncontributing to climate change. Other things being equal, more people\nresult in more emissions, so, given the direness of the situation\npolicies need to be implemented which will sufficiently lower world\npopulation size. Some\u2014like Sarah Conly\u2014argue, on this\nbasis, each couple has a right to no more than one child (Conly 2016).\n\n\nAssessing such arguments requires a combination of empirical,\nnormative and political analysis. A first step would be to consider\nall the determinants of climatic harms and to have a\nquantitative analysis of their effects and the extent to which their\necological footprint could be reduced. Such an analysis would include\nnot simply the number of people, but also (1) the levels of\nconsumption, (2) the extent of waste, (3) the nature of the energy\nsystem (does it use renewables or not?), (4) the distribution of\naccess to clean technology, (5) the extent to which energy efficiency\nprogrammes are in place, (6) the extent to which fossil fuels are\nbeing subsidised, (7) the nature of the public transport system, (8)\nthe urban infrastructure and the spatial organisation of cities, (9)\nbuilding design, (10) the extent to which deforestation is reversed,\nand programmes of afforestation and reforestation are pursued, and so\non (Caney 2020). To make a case for a Conly-style conclusion one would\nthen have to show that either:\n\nthe above are insufficient, or\nthe above are (singly or in combination) sufficient but constitute\na less desirable kind of response than limiting procreative choice,\nor, perhaps\nthe above may be sufficient and more desirable than Conly\u2019s\nresponse but they are less politically feasible.\n\n\nAnother challenge facing Conly\u2019s conclusion is that it needs to\nshow that the optimal response turns out to be 1 child per couple and\nthat the same constraint applies equally to all irrespective of the\nsize of their ecological footprint.\n\nEthical concerns about attempts to limit world population have long\nbeen expressed. For example, Maria Mies and Vandana Shiva argued in\nEcofeminism (1993 [2014]) that programmes to limit world\npopulation reinforce control of women\u2019s bodies. Furthermore,\nthey object to proposals to curb world population growth that do not\ncall into question the high consumption lifestyles of affluent\ncountries, and instead convey the morally misleading message that\nresponsibility for the environmental crisis lies with low-emitting\ndeveloping countries (Mies & Vandana 1993 [2014: chapter 19]).\n7.3 Geoengineering\n\nOne additional climate policy needs also be mentioned, namely\n\u201cgeoengineering\u201d the climate system, either by extracting\ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere (Carbon Dioxide Removal) or by\nseeking to block the sun\u2019s rays (Solar Radiation Management).\nThese raise a host of ethical issues.\n\nOne concern is that some forms of geoengineering can have harmful\nside-effects, ones that can harm already vulnerable people (a point\nwhich takes us back to\n Section 7.1).\n For example, some forms of solar radiation management may affect the\nmonsoon season in India (Jamieson 2014: 220).\n\nA second challenge is that while they may constitute a response to\nclimate change in some sense, some geoengineering policies (like Solar\nRadiation Management), do not tackle other greenhouse-gas related\nproblems like ocean acidification, whereas mitigation policies would\n(Jamieson 2014: 220).\n\nA related concern is that geoengineering policies are unnecessary\nbecause other less risky policies (like mitigation) should be\nadopted.\n\nA fourth problem concerns the political legitimacy of decisions to go\nahead with geoengineering. Geoengineering policies can have\nwide-ranging impacts on many countries and so it would be problematic\nfor some to engage in it unilaterally (Jamieson 2014: 222\u2013224).\nIf they are to be legitimate such world-shaping policies would stand\nin need of an inclusive decision-making process that is global in\nscope.\n\n(For rich discussions of the ethical issues surrounding geoengineering\nsee further Gardiner [2010; 2011: chapter 10], Jamieson [2014:\n219\u2013227] and, from a Confucian perspective, Wong [2015].)\n8. Climate Justice in a Nonideal World\n\nThe preceding sections have discussed different questions of justice\nthat arise when considering how to respond to climate change, and they\nhave explored different answers that can be given. One persistent\nfeature of global and domestic climate policies is that there has been\na high level of noncompliance with principles of climate justice.\nGiven this, it is appropriate to ask: \u201cWhat principles of\njustice should apply in the context of noncompliance?\u201d\n\nDifferent responses have been given. To locate them it may be helpful\nto set out the possibilities (Caney 2016).\n\nOne response might be \u201cduty-reallocation\u201d.\nThat is, one might propose a solution in which some bear some of the\nresponsibilities that should, ideally, be borne by others.\nA second response might be to relax the moral\nconstraints on mitigation policies, the aim being to make it more\nlikely that non-complying agents will discharge their duties to\nmitigate.\nA third (related) response might be to adopt other\nextreme responses that one might think are normally unacceptable but\npermissible in an emergency.\nA fourth response might be to take a more proactive\nstance and seek to tackle the underlying structures which lead to\nnoncompliance (for example, by designing institutions which reduce\nsuch noncompliance and undermining organisations which are thwarting\nsuccessful climate action).\nA fifth response might be \u201ctarget\nmodification\u201d. That is, one might lower one\u2019s ambition, so\nwhereas one might think that justice ideally requires a 1.5\u00b0C\ntarget one might accept a less ambitious target.\n\n\nA number of philosophers have argued for a\n type (1)-like response.\n One version maintains that some (the advantaged) should take on more\nthan their fair share of responsibilities. A second version is defended by Broome. He\nargues that current generations ought to reduce their emissions to\ntackle climate change and that they ought to absorb the costs of doing\nso. However, he also thinks that implementing an effective climate\ntreaty is of paramount significance and that parties will not agree to\none if they have to pay. In light of this he suggests that they should\nmitigate but pass on the costs to future generations (Broome 2012:\n47\u201348). Broome thinks this involves an unjust distribution of\ncosts but that it is nonetheless, all things considered, justified\nbecause it helps prevent dangerous climate change. Broome\u2019s\nsolution involves some (current people) making\nothers (future people) bear an unjust burden. A third related\nposition is defended by Eric Posner and David Weisbach (2010). They\nargue that a climate treaty is imperative but will not be feasible\nunless it leaves signatories to the climate treaty no worse off. They\nassume that the benefits from such a treaty will be such that there is\na \u201csurplus\u201d and so no one need be worse off. However, if\nthis assumption does not hold then their commitment to leaving high\nemitters no worse off might also entail that others bear an unjust\nburden (making it a\n type (1) response).\n As they recognise, even if there is a surplus some powerful states\nmay agree to a treaty only if they receive such extensive compensation\nthat it leaves others with more than their fair share of\nresponsibilities or burdens (Posner and Weisbach 2010: 181). \n\nConsider now\n (2):\n some might think that normally one should not convert a place of\ngreat natural beauty into giant fields of solar panels, but they might\nalso think that, in dire circumstances, this prohibition can be\noverturned. If we now consider\n (3):\n many would see geoengineering as a version of this kind of response.\nAnd if we turn to\n (4):\n This is a corollary of some of the views discussed in\n Section 5.3,\n which generally held that agents have political responsibilities to\ncreate just and effective institutions and responsibilities to combat\nongoing campaigns to thwart effective climate action.\n\nWhat response (or combination of responses) one thinks to be the least\nbad here will depend on one\u2019s overall theory of justice.\nSufficientarians, for example, may think that the affluent\u2014those\nabove the specified sufficiency threshold\u2014should take on more\nthan their fair share of burdens, but will reject the idea that any of the world\u2019s\npoorest should be required to adopt\n response (1)\n (unless perhaps it is absolutely necessary for very large numbers of future people to\nenjoy what they are entitled to).\n9. Concluding Remarks\n\nIt is time to conclude. This entry has provided an overview of eight\nquestions of justice that arise in the context of climate change. It\nis salutary to end by noting two points\n\nFirst, it is worth noting that the focus has been on climate\njustice and that justice is not the only relevant value. When\nconfronting the challenges of climate change (and the Anthropocene\nmore generally) justice clearly plays a large role, but many would\nargue for the relevance of other kinds of moral consideration,\nincluding a recognition of the intrinsic value of the natural world.\nClimate ethics, one might say, includes more than justice.\n\nSecond, it is also worth noting that taking climate justice seriously\nmay have major implications for existing economic institutions and\nideologies (such as the valorisation of economic growth), as well as\nfor political institutions (Gardiner 2011; Jamieson 2014). Some\ncritics of the status quo believe that capitalism cannot cope with\nclimate change. Some doubt the ability of our contemporary\ninstitutional architecture to address the current challenges facing\nhumanity. Evaluating such claims clearly requires extensive empirical\nanalysis. Only with the help of climate science, history, politics,\neconomics, anthropology, political economy, sociology, science and\ntechnology studies, and law can we begin to address such claims. But\nphilosophical analysis has its part to play and without an\nunderstanding of climate justice we lack a compass to guide us.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Agarwal, Anil and Sunita Narain, 1991, <em>Global Warming in an\nUnequal World: A Case of Environmental Colonialism</em>, New Delhi:\nCentre for Science and Environment.", "Allen, Myles, Opha Dube, and William Solecki, 2019, \u201cChapter\n1: Framing and Context\u201d, in IPCC 2019: 49\u201391.", "Bell, Derek R., 2008, \u201cCarbon Justice?
