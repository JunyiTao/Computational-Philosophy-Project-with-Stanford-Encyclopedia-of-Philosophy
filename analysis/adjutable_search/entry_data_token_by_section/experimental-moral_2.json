    "main_text": "Introduction and History || What Types of Questions and Data?\n1.2 What Types of Questions and Data?\n\nLike experimental philosophy more generally, experimental moral\nphilosophy is interested in our intuitions and judgments about\nphilosophical thought experiments and moral dilemmas. But research in\nthis area also concerns the cognitive architecture underlying our\nmoral judgments; the developmental processes that give rise to moral\njudgments; the neuroscience of moral judgment; and other related\nfields.\n\nDirect experiments investigate whether a claim held (or\ndenied) by philosophers is corroborated or falsified. This might mean\ninvestigating an intuition and whether it is as widely shared as\nphilosophers claim, or it might mean investigating the claim that a\ncertain behavior or trait is widespread or that two factors covary.\nFor example, we find philosophers claiming that it is wrong to\nimprison an innocent person to prevent rioting; that a good life must\nbe authentic; and that moral judgments are intrinsically motivating.\nExperimental research can be (and has been, as we will see below)\nbrought to bear on each of these claims.\n\nIndirect experiments look at the nature of some capacity or\njudgment: for example, whether certain types of moral dilemmas engage\nparticular areas of the brain; how early children develop a capacity\nto empathize; and whether the moral/conventional distinction is\nuniversal across cultures (for discussion of the moral/conventional\ndistinction, see Machery & Stich 2022). These claims have\nphilosophical relevance insofar as they help us understand the nature\nof moral judgment.\n\nIn addition to distinctions involving the type of data and how\ndirectly it bears on the question, we can also distinguish among\nexperimental applied ethics, experimental normative ethics, and\nexperimental metaethics. The first involves the variables that\ninfluence judgments about particular practical problems, such as how a\nself-driving car should respond to sacrificial dilemmas (Bonnefon,\nSharriff & Rahwan 2016). The second involves investigations\nof how we ought to behave, act, and judge, as well as our intuitions\nabout moral responsibility, character, and what constitutes a good\nlife. The third involves debates over moral realism and antirealism.\nIn this entry we focus on the latter two.\n\nIn many of these cases, the line between experimental moral philosophy\nand its neighbors is difficult to draw: what distinguishes\nexperimental moral philosophy from empirical moral psychology? What is\nthe difference between experimental moral philosophy and psychology or\nneuroscience that investigates morality? What is the difference\nbetween experimental moral philosophy and metaethics? We might try to\nanswer these questions by pointing to the training of the\nexperimenters\u2014as philosophers or as scientists\u2014but much of\nthe work in these areas is done by collaborative teams involving both\nphilosophers and social scientists or neuroscientists. In addition,\nsome philosophers work in law and psychology departments, and graduate\nprograms increasingly offer cross-disciplinary training. Another\napproach would be to look at the literature with which the work\nengages: many psychologists (e.g., Haidt, Greene) investigating moral\njudgment situate their arguments within the debate between Kantians\nand Humeans, so engagement with the philosophical tradition might be\nused as a criterion to distinguish experimental moral philosophy from\nexperimental moral psychology. All this said, an inability to sharply\ndistinguish experimental moral philosophy from adjoining areas of\ninvestigation may not be particularly important. Experimental\nphilosophers often point out that the disciplinary divide between\nphilosophy and psychology is a relatively recent phenomenon; early\ntwentieth-century writers such as William James situated themselves in\nboth disciplines, making vital contributions to each. If there is a\nproblem here, it is not unique to experimental moral philosophy. For\nexample, is work on semantics that uses both linguistics and analytic\nphilosophy best understood as linguistics or philosophy of language?\nThese debates arise, and may be largely moot, for many research\nprograms that cut across disciplinary boundaries.\n\nThe rest of this entry proceeds as follows. Section 2 canvasses\nexperimental research on moral judgments and intuitions, describing\nvarious programmatic uses to which experimental results have been put,\nthen turning to examples of experimental research on moral judgment\nand intuition, including intuitions about intentionality and\nresponsibility, the so-called linguistic analogy, and some\ncross-cultural work. Section 3 discusses experimental results on thick\n(i.e., simultaneously descriptive and normative) topics, including\ncharacter and virtue, well-being, emotion and affect, and moral\nstanding. Section 4 discusses questions about moral disagreement and\nmoral language, both important sources of evidence in the longstanding\ndebate over moral objectivity. Section 5 considers some objections to\nexperimental moral philosophy.\n",
