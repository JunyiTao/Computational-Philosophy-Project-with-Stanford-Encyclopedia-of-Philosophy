    "main_text": "Prison Writings || Hegemony\n3.1 Hegemony\n\nThe concept often regarded as the locus of innovation in the\nNotebooks\u2014and hence their philosophical\nlinchpin\u2014is \u201chegemony\u201d (egemonia),\nsignifying both leadership and domination.\n\nHegemony had been a common term in debates among Russian Marxists and\nusually described the leading (or \u201chegemonic\u201d) role of the\nworking class over its allies in a political coalition. But it had\nalso been employed by Italian political thinkers in the nineteenth\ncentury to imagine gradually building consent across the nation for\nthe new state\u2014\u201cmaking Italians\u201d\u2014rather than\nrelying exclusively on the exercise of force. Gramsci fused these\nmeanings to present hegemony as the general hypothesis that a social\nclass aims to achieve consensual domination for its rule by\nprogressively expanding its leadership across society (see Femia\n1981).\n\nThis idea\u2014with its potential for variation in empirical focus\nand application\u2014was developed across different notes and topics,\nsometimes as a methodological device to analyze historical situations,\nat other times alongside different concepts to make strategic\nobservations. But it also functioned more broadly as a philosophical\nhorizon highlighting the inseparability of thought and action,\nsignaling that all intellectual enquiries were unavoidably implicated\nin the formation of an integral \u201cway of life\u201d. Focusing on\nhegemony permits us to appreciate the Notebooks as a unified\nintellectual project, despite their disparate themes and contrasting\naccents.\n\nThe major themes of Gramsci\u2019s ideas concerning hegemony are\nexplored below, starting with his \u201csociological\u201d\nobservations on the state, intellectuals, and ideology\n (\u00a73.2\u20134),\n and then looking at his theoretical reconstruction of Marxist\nphilosophy\n (\u00a73.5),\n and his observations concerning the revolutionary party\n (\u00a73.6).\n",
