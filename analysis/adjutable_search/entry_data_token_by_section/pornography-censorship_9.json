    "main_text": "Ongoing Debate: Liberals and Feminists || Liberals and Feminists\n6. Non-Legal Remedies\n\nSo far, I have focused on the controversial question of whether and\nwhy legal regulation of (some) pornography\u2014either in the form of\ncriminal liability or civil penalties\u2014can be justified in a\nliberal society. But legal regulation is costly. Consequently, if there\nare less restrictive measures to prevent or counteract pornography\u2019s\nharms available, these should obviously be preferred instead\nof\u2014or as well as\u2014legal regulation.\n\nBy far the most popular alternative to regulation recommends\ncountering \u201cbad\u201d speech with more \u201cgood\u201d speech\n(Gelber 2021). In principle, this might include government sponsored\npublic education campaigns to warn consumers of the harmful effects of\nconsuming violent and misogynistic pornography, and/or to promote a\ncounter-message of sexual equality and respect for women. In practice,\nhowever, liberal states have generally taken little direct action to\ncounteract inegalitarian pornography\u2019s messages about women and sex,\npreferring to leave the burden of counter-speech entirely to private\nindividuals. Even if legal regulation of violent and misogynistic\npornography is unwarranted or undesirable all things considered, such\nstate inaction in the face of pornography\u2019s role in endorsing and\nperpetuating sexual inequality may be indefensible. If violent and\nmisogynistic pornography perpetuates and reinforces harmful sexist\nattitudes and behavior (quite apart from whether it also leads to\nsexual violence) then there may be an important role for governments to\nplay in helping to counter pornography\u2019s harmful sexist messaging\nthrough government-backed public education campaigns. Without\nrestricting anyone\u2019s speech, such campaigns would lend the epistemic\nand political authority of the state to private opinion in countering\nharmful inegalitarian messages about sex. State-backed counter-speech\nmay be especially important to inform adolescent consumers of harms\nassociated with inegalitarian pornography, and also if private\ncounter-speakers are silenced, so that counter-speech is otherwise\nliable systematically to be ignored or misunderstood (see Dotson\u2019s\ndiscussion of \u201ctestimonial quieting\u201d in Dotson 2011).\n\nIn the end, it is an empirical question what combination of legal\nand non-legal means are likely to be most effective in challenging\nsexual inequality; however, there are some reasons to think that\ncounter-speech alone may be less effective than advocates commonly\nsuppose. Firstly, if widespread consumption of pornography\n\u201csilences\u201d women, or restricts their ability successfully\nto communicate relevant counter-messages, then counter-speech is not an\noption, at least for those silenced. Secondly, pornography may affect\nconsumers\u2019 attitudes in ways that escape their conscious notice. It may\nbe going too far to liken consumers of pornography to Pavlov\u2019s dogs,\nbut it is not unreasonable to think that much of pornography\u2019s\ninfluence is less than fully mentally-intermediated, and so less\namenable to rational revision in response to counter-speech.\nConclusion\n\nWhat are the harms of pornography? How should liberal societies\nrespond to the proliferation of harmful pornography? How should\nliberals conceptualize and balance important values such as equality\nand freedom of speech? What role should the state play in protecting\nand promoting values such as autonomy and equality? Can liberal ideals\nbe reconciled with feminist principles and goals? The search for\nanswers to important questions such as these accounts for much of the\nongoing philosophical interest in the question of pornography and\ncensorship.\n",
