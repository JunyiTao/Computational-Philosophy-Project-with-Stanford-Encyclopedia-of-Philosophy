    "main_text": "Subject of Metaphysics\n2. Subject of Metaphysics\n\n\nGodfrey was surely familiar with the controversy concerning whether\none should with Avicenna stress the nonparticular and therefore the\nuniversal character of being as being and hence make this the subject\nof metaphysics or rather with Averroes emphasize it as the science\nwhich has the highest kind of being, the divine, as its subject. On\nthis Godfrey clearly agrees with Avicenna, even though he devotes\nlittle explicit attention to the controversy itself. Thus in Quodlibet\nX, q. 11 he holds that being as being is the object (or subject) of\nmetaphysics (PB 4.349), and in Quodlibet VI, q. 6 that the concept of\nbeing is first and simplest because it enters into every other concept\n(PB 3.137). Therefore it is also the most general concept or, one may\nsay, transcendental. At times Godfrey also describes the object of the\nintellect as being as being (Quodlibet II, q. 8). He denies that God is\nthe subject of metaphysics, even though God is the first and primary\nbeing and must be studied within metaphysics (Quodlibet I, q. 5). He\ndistinguishes a metaphysical study of God, which he says may be\ndescribed as a kind of theology, from the theology that is based on\nSacred Scripture. This does not have being as being as its subject, but\nGod himself (Quodlibet IX, q. 20; Wippel, 1981, 3\u201315).\n",
