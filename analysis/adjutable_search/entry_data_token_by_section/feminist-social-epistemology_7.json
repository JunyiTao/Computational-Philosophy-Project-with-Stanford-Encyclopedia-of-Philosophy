    "main_text": "Social Models of Knowledge and Objectivity || Objectivity as a Social Process\n3.2 Objectivity as a Social Process\n\n\nNumerous feminist social epistemologists, particularly those working\nin philosophy of science, have employed the underdetermination thesis\nto argue for the necessary role of background assumptions in theory\nchoice (Anderson 1995b; Longino 1990, 2002; Nelson 1990; Potter 1996).\nIf theory is underdetermined by the data, and multiple theories can\nalways explain the data equally well, then data alone cannot determine\nthe best theory. Background assumptions must be employed as well. The\nproblem is that background assumptions, which may include\nmethodological assumptions, assumptions with empirical content,\nmetaphysical assumptions, and value-laden assumptions, are rarely\narticulated. They may also be gendered, or otherwise shaped by\nculturally salient social identity categories. Drawing attention to\nthe necessary role of these often unarticulated assumptions has\nallowed feminist philosophers of science to explain both how\nandrocentric and sexist assumptions have managed to persevere for so\nlong in science, as well as why feminist values do not have to be\neliminated from scientific research in order for it to constitute good\nscience. But in order to make epistemic distinctions and continue to\nclaim that some theory choices are better than others, they must\nexplain how we are to sort through and select those background\nassumptions we are willing to rely on.\n\n\nHelen Longino has developed a very influential theory of contextual\nempiricism that includes a social conception of objectivity. According\nto Longino, a theory is objective if it has undergone and survived a\ncertain social process of critical scrutiny. Through public critical\nscrutiny, the background assumptions upon which particular theories\ndepend for their support have the potential to be revealed, and\nidiosyncratic assumptions can be weeded out. In order to ensure that\nthis system of public scrutiny is working well, Longino sets out four\ngoverning norms of interaction in an epistemic community: there must\nbe publicly recognized forums for criticism, uptake of criticism,\npublic standards, and tempered (to allow for differences in\nintellectual capacity) equality of intellectual authority (Longino\n 2002).[12]\n To the extent that these norms of social interaction are fulfilled by\nan epistemic community, the theories they are considering will be\nsubject to the appropriate kind of public critical scrutiny, and their\nresults will be objective. Diverse representation within the community\nalso becomes important, since \u201ca diversity of perspectives is\nnecessary for vigorous and epistemically effective critical discourse\u201d\n(Longino 2002, 131). The greater the diversity in the community, the\ngreater the opportunity for revealing background assumptions that may\nbe shared by large segments of the membership. Once a background\nassumption is revealed, the process of critical scrutiny determines\nwhether it is acceptable or problematic and in need of rejection. The\nresultant knowledge will not be aperspectival and will not be free of\nbackground assumptions. However, it will represent a perspective that is\nbroader than any one individual can bring to the table; it will also have been\nfound appropriate for the particular epistemic goals of the\ncommunity.\n\n\nOthers describe the possibility of objectivity given the perspectival\nnature of knowledge in a slightly different way. Using the term\n\u201cbias\u201d to refer to interest or perspective, Louise Antony\ncharacterizes the challenge for feminist epistemologists who criticize\nthe idea of objectivity as neutrality or impartiality as the\n\u201cbias paradox\u201d: such feminists both criticize neutrality\nand impartiality (arguing that such impartiality is impossible due to\nthe situatedness of knowledge) at the same time as they must appeal to\nimpartiality in criticizing male bias as \u201cbad\u201d (Antony\n1993). Her solution is to adopt a naturalistic and empirical approach\nto biases, embracing the idea that biases are an inevitable component\nof knowing, but arguing that it is an empirical question to determine\nwhich biases are good in that they lead to the truth, and which are\nbad in that they lead us away from truth. Richmond Campbell develops\nthese ideas further, arguing that armed with realist conceptions of\ntruth and objective justification, we can explain (without\ncircularity) how feminist biases can lead us closer to the truth\nwithin contexts of systematic gender bias in epistemic communities\n(Campbell 2001, 1998). Elizabeth Anderson uses the case study of\nfeminist research on divorce to argue that the feminist values (which\nCampbell and Antony might consider biases) used in such research are\nboth empirically testable and supported by the evidence (Anderson\n2004). Sharyn Clough suggests that such a holistic relationship\nbetween descriptive facts and prescriptive values forms a core feature\nof feminist science studies (Clough 2004). Miriam Solomon\ncharacterizes such views described above as \u201cfeminist radical\nempiricism\u201d because they adopt the view that not only are\nfactual claims empirically testable (as do other feminist\nempiricists), but more radically they embrace the idea that the values\nor biases that inform our theory choices are also empirically testable\nthemselves (Solomon 2012). Solomon herself argues for a more\npluralistic understanding of the role of values in knowledge\nproduction, noting that values are sometimes relevant to the domain of\ninquiry and can be empirically tested, but not always. Still others\nsuch as Audrey Yap caution against any presumption that empirically\ntesting our values will be useful in promoting social change, given\ndeep sources of prejudice and stereotyping (Yap 2016).  \n",
