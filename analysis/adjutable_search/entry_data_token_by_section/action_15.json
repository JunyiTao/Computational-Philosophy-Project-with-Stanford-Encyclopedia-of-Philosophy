    "main_text": "The Ontology of Actions || The Individuation of Action\n5.2 The Individuation of Action\n\nThe example of the pumper displays another important Anscombean thesis\n(endorsed by Davidson, see section 2.2 above): that a single event can\ninstantiate different properties in terms of which it can be\ndescribed. Thus, the same action is at once a moving of the\nhands, a pumping of water, and a poisoning.\nThis was important for Anscombe because she held that actions are\nintentional only under some descriptions: for instance, even if the\npumper\u2019s energetic moves scare a nearby squirrel, the action\nwould not be intentional under the description scaring of a\nsquirrel.\n\nThe most influential alternative to this \u201ccoarse-grained\u201d\naccount is a \u201cfine-grained\u201d account that individuates\nactions (and events, more generally) in terms of their properties (Kim\n1966; 1969; 1973; 1976; Goldman 1970). On this view, A and\nB are the same action just in case A has all and\nonly the properties that B has; and for each set of such\nproperties, there is an event. Since moving one\u2019s hands, pumping\nwater, and poisoning are distinct properties, this view entails that\nthe pumper\u2019s moving of his hands, his pumping of the water, and\nhis poisoning of the inhabitants are distinct actions.\n\nAnscombe complained that treating these as different actions would be\nlike treating the author of David Copperfield and the author\nof Bleak House as different men, rather than a single author,\nDickens (Anscombe 1979, 222). Indeed, the fine-grained view has\nsimilar counterintuitive implications. Consider: the properties of\npumping water, pumping water while smiling, and pumping water at noon,\nare all different properties. So, the man who pumped water at noon\nwhile smiling would have engaged in three different pumpings according\nto the fine-grained view.\n\nMoreover, the view threatens to undermine some basic inferences we are\ninclined to make about actions (Katz 1978). For instance, it seems\nobvious that from:\n\n(8)\nThe table in the room is brown.\n\n\nWe can infer:\n\n(9)\nThe table in the room = the brown table.\n\n\nBut, similarly, it seems that from:\n\n(10)\nThe man\u2019s pumping occurred at noon.\n\n\nWe can infer:\n\n(11)\nThe man\u2019s pumping = The man\u2019s pumping at noon.\n\n\nHowever, on the fine-grained view the inference to (11) is invalid\nsince the two descriptions in (11) must refer to distinct events.\nHence the defender of the fine-grained view is forced to reject a\nseemingly innocuous inference pattern.\n\nThese are serious problems, and it is not clear that defenders of the\nfine-grained view can do more than bite the bullets. However, it has\nbeen argued that the coarse-grained account has similarly\ncounterintuitive implications (Goldman 1970; Thomson 1971). To see\nwhy, consider the following two sentences (true of the imagined\npumper):\n\n(12)\nThe man moved his hands before he poisoned the inhabitants.\n(13)\nThe man caused the poisoning of the inhabitants by moving his\nhands.\n\n\nWe can paraphrase them using gerundival expressions as follows:\n\n(12*)\nThe man\u2019s moving of his hands happened before the poisoning\nof the inhabitants.\n(13*)\nThe man\u2019s moving of his hands caused the poisoning of the\ninhabitants.\n\n\nNow, suppose we assume the claim that:\n\n(14)\nThe man\u2019s moving of his hands = the man\u2019s poisoning of\nthe inhabitants.\n\n\nThen, by substitution, we arrive at the absurd:\n\n(15)\nThe man\u2019s moving of his hands happened before the\nman\u2019s moving of his hands.\n(16)\nThe man\u2019s moving of his hands caused his moving of his\nhands.\n\n\nIt is natural to think that (14) is the culprit; but to hold that\nclaims such as (14) are false seems to amount to rejecting the\ncoarse-grained view of action individuation.\n\nOne possible response would be to hold that the contexts \u231c\u03c6\nhappens* before \u03c8\u231d and \u231c\u03c6 causes* \u03c8\u231d\n(the * marks tenselessness) are intensional in the \u03c6 and \u03c8\npositions (Anscombe 1969). If so, substitution of co-referents may\nchange truth value in these contexts. Alternatively, one could attempt\nto explain these results pragmatically: the sentences sound odd in the\nsame way as it sounds odd to say that \u201ca man married his\nwidow\u2019, even though it is true (the man married her\nbefore she was a widow, of course!) (cf. Anscombe 1979).\nHowever, these are controversial semantic theses (for further\nintensionalist treatments, see Achinstein 1975; McDermott 1995;\nWasserman 2004; for extensionalist treatments, see e.g., Davidson\n1967a; Strawson 1985; Rosenberg and Martin 1979; Schaffer 2005; for an\nexcellent review of research on causal contexts more generally,\nincluding pragmatic effects, see Swanson 2012).\n\nA different response is suggested by the view that actions are\nprocesses. That view enables us to treat action descriptions as\nsometimes characterizing the different stages of the action (cf.\nRussell 2018). Then, appealing to Anscombe\u2019s insight that we\nshould treat claims about actions in parallel with claims about\npersons, we could say that the moving of one\u2019s hands precedes\nand causes the poisoning in an analogous way as the acorn precedes and\ncauses the oak. But just as there is a single organism in the latter\ncase, there is a single action in the former, even though it seems at\nbest paradoxical to say that I caused myself to exist, or that the oak\ncaused the acorn.\n\nFinally, the coarse- and fine-grained views obviously do not exhaust\nthe conceptual landscape. A number of philosophers have offered\nindividuation principles stricter than those advanced by\ncoarse-grained theorists, but laxer than those advanced by\nfine-grained theorists (e.g. Ginet 1990). Charles (1984), for example,\nargues that Aristotle would individuate actions in terms of\ncapacities. This allows us to say that the moving of one\u2019s hands\nis the same action as the moving of one\u2019s hands quickly (since a\nsingle capacity is thereby actualized), even though it is a different\naction from the poisoning, which actualizes a different set of\ncapacities. The challenge for this view is to provide an account of\nthe individuation of capacities independent of the account of the\nindividuation of actions.\n",
