    "main_text": "\n\nThe usual meaning of the word continuous is\n\u201cunbroken\u201d or \u201cuninterrupted\u201d: thus a\ncontinuous entity\u2014a continuum\u2014has no\n\u201cgaps\u201d. We commonly suppose that space and time are\ncontinuous, and certain philosophers have maintained that all natural\nprocesses occur continuously: witness, for example, Leibniz\u2019s\nfamous apothegm natura non facit saltus\u2014\u201cnature\nmakes no jump\u201d. In mathematics the word is used in the same\ngeneral sense, but has had to be furnished with increasingly precise\ndefinitions. So, for instance, in the later eighteenth century\ncontinuity of a function was taken to mean that infinitesimal changes\nin the value of the argument induced infinitesimal changes in the\nvalue of the function. With the abandonment of infinitesimals in the\nnineteenth century this definition came to be replaced by one\nemploying the more precise concept of limit.\n\nTraditionally, an infinitesimal quantity is one which, while\nnot necessarily coinciding with zero, is in some sense smaller than\nany finite quantity. For engineers, an infinitesimal is a quantity so\nsmall that its square and all higher powers can be neglected. In the\ntheory of limits the term \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d is sometimes\napplied to any sequence whose limit is zero. An infinitesimal\nmagnitude may be regarded as what remains after a continuum has\nbeen subjected to an exhaustive analysis, in other words, as a\ncontinuum \u201cviewed in the small\u201d. It is in this sense that\ncontinuous curves have sometimes been held to be\n\u201ccomposed\u201d of infinitesimal straight lines.\n\nInfinitesimals have a long and colorful history. They make an early\nappearance in the mathematics of the Greek atomist philosopher\nDemocritus (c. 450 BCE), only to be banished by the mathematician\nEudoxus (c. 350 BCE) in what was to become official\n\u201cEuclidean\u201d mathematics. Taking the somewhat obscure form\nof \u201cindivisibles\u201d, they reappear in the mathematics of the\nlate Middle Ages and later played an important role in the development\nof the calculus. Their doubtful logical status led in the nineteenth\ncentury to their abandonment and replacement by the limit concept. In\nrecent years, however, the concept of infinitesimal has been refounded\non a rigorous basis.\n",
