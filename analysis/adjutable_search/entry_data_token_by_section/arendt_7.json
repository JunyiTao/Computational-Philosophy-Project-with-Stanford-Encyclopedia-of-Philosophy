    "main_text": "Arendt\u2019s Theory of Action || Action, Power, and the Space of Appearance\n4.4 Action, Power, and the Space of Appearance\n\n\nThe metaphor of the polis recurs constantly in the writings\nof Arendt. This is indeed a \u2018metaphor\u2019 because in\nemploying this term Arendt is not simply referring to the political\ninstitutions of the Greek city-states, bounded as they were to their\ntime and circumstance, but to all those instances in history where a\npublic realm of action and speech was set up among a community of free\nand equal citizens.  \u201cThe polis, properly speaking, is\nnot the city-state in its physical location; it is the organization of\nthe people as it arises out of acting and speaking together, and its\ntrue space lies between people living together for this purpose, no\nmatter where they happen to be\u201d (HC, 198). Thus the famous\nmotto: \u201cWherever you go, you will be a polis\u201d\nexpressed the conviction among the Greek colonists that the kind of\npolitical association they had set up originally could be reproduced\nin their new settlements, that the space created by the \u201csharing\nof words and deeds\u201d could find its proper location almost\nanywhere.\n\n\nFor Arendt, therefore, the polis stands for the\nspace of appearance, for that space \u201cwhere I\nappear to others as others appear to me, where men exist not merely\nlike other living or inanimate things, but to make their appearance\nexplicitly.\u201d Such public space of appearance can be always\nrecreated anew wherever individuals gather together politically, that\nis, \u201cwherever men are together in the manner of speech and\naction\u201d (HC, 198\u20139). However, since it is a creation of action,\nthis space of appearance is highly fragile and exists only when\nactualized through the performance of deeds or the utterance of words.\nIts peculiarity, as Arendt says, is that \u201cunlike the spaces which\nare the work of our hands, it does not survive the actuality of the\nmovement which brought it into being, but disappears not only with the\ndispersal of men \u2014 as in the case of great catastrophes when the body\npolitic of a people is destroyed \u2014 but with the disappearance or arrest\nof the activities themselves. Wherever people gather together, it is\npotentially there, but only potentially, not necessarily and not\nforever\u201d (HC, 199).\n\n\nThe space of appearance must be continually recreated by action; its\nexistence is secured whenever actors gather together for the purpose\nof discussing and deliberating about matters of public concern, and it\ndisappears the moment these activities cease. It is always a potential\nspace that finds its actualization in the actions and speeches of\nindividuals who have come together to undertake some common\nproject. It may arise suddenly, as in the case of revolutions, or it\nmay develop slowly out of the efforts to change some specific piece of\nlegislation or policy. Historically, it has been recreated whenever\npublic spaces of action and deliberation have been set up, from town\nhall meetings to workers\u2019 councils, from demonstrations and\nsit-ins to struggles for justice and equal rights.\n\n\nThis capacity to act in concert for a public-political purpose is what\nArendt calls power. Power needs to be distinguished\nfrom strength, force, and violence (CR, 143\u201355). Unlike\nstrength, it is not the property of an individual, but of a plurality\nof actors joining together for some common political purpose. Unlike\nforce, it is not a natural phenomenon but a human creation, the\noutcome of collective engagement. And unlike violence, it is based not\non coercion but on consent and rational persuasion.\n\n\nFor Arendt, power is a sui generis phenomenon, since it is a\nproduct of action and rests entirely on persuasion. It is a product of\naction because it arises out of the concerted activities of a\nplurality of agents, and it rests on persuasion because it consists in\nthe ability to secure the consent of others through unconstrained\ndiscussion and debate. Its only limitation is the existence of other\npeople, but this limitation, she notes, \u201cis not accidental,\nbecause human power corresponds to the condition of plurality to begin\nwith\u201d (HC, 201). It is actualized in all those cases where\naction is undertaken for communicative (rather than strategic or\ninstrumental) purposes, and where speech is employed to disclose our\nintentions and to articulate our motives to others.\n\n\nArendt maintains that the legitimacy of power is derived from the\ninitial getting together of people, that is, from the original pact of\nassociation that establishes a political community, and is reaffirmed\nwhenever individuals act in concert through the medium of speech and\npersuasion. For her \u201cpower needs no justification, being\ninherent in the very existence of political communities; what it does\nneed is legitimacy ... Power springs up whenever people get together\nand act in concert, but it derives its legitimacy from the initial\ngetting together rather than from any action that then may\nfollow\u201d (CR, 151).\n\n\nBeyond appealing to the past, power also relies for its continued\nlegitimacy on the rationally binding commitments that arise out of a\nprocess of free and undistorted communication. Because of this, power\nis highly independent of material factors: it is sustained not by\neconomic, bureaucratic or military means, but by the power of common\nconvictions that result from a process of fair and unconstrained\ndeliberation.\n\n\nPower is also not something that can be relied upon at all times or\naccumulated and stored for future use. Rather, it exists only as a\npotential which is actualized when actors gather together for\npolitical action and public deliberation. It is thus closely connected\nto the space of appearance, that public space which arises out of the\nactions and speeches of individuals. Indeed, for Arendt, \u201cpower\nis what keeps the public realm, the potential space of appearance\nbetween acting and speaking men, in existence.\u201d Like the space\nof appearance, power is always \u201ca power potential and not an\nunchangeable, measurable and reliable entity like force or strength\n\u2026 [it] springs up between men when they act together and\nvanishes the moment they disperse\u201d (HC, 200).\n\n\nPower, then, lies at the basis of every political community and is the\nexpression of a potential that is always available to actors. It is\nalso the source of legitimacy of political and governmental\ninstitutions, the means whereby they are transformed and adapted to\nnew circumstances and made to respond to the opinions and needs of the\ncitizens. \u201cIt is the people\u2019s support that lends power to the\ninstitutions of a country, and this support is but the continuation of\nthe consent that brought the laws into existence to begin with\n\u2026 All political institutions are manifestations and\nmaterializations of power; they petrify and decay as soon as the\nliving power of the people ceases to uphold them\u201d (CR, 140).\n\n\nThe legitimacy of political institutions is dependent on the power,\nthat is, the active consent of the people; and insofar as governments\nmay be viewed as attempts to preserve power for future generations by\ninstitutionalizing it, they require for their vitality the continuing\nsupport and active involvement of all citizens.\n",
