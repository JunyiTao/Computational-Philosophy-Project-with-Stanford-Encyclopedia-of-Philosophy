He offers a counter-example to the thesis that\nknowledge is true belief. A skilled lawyer can bring jurymen into a\nstate of true belief without bringing them into a state of knowledge;\nso knowledge and true belief are different states.\n\n\nMcDowell 1976: 227\u20138 suggests that this swift argument\n\u201ccontradicts the most characteristic expositions of the Theory\nof Forms, which indicate that the title \u2018knowledge\u2019 should\nbe reserved for a relation between the mind and the Forms untainted by\nany reliance on perception.\u201d By contrast Plato here tells us,\nquite unambiguously, that the jury are persuaded into a state of true\nbelief \u201cabout things which only someone who sees them can\nknow\u201d (201b8). This implies that there can be knowledge which is\nentirely reliant on perception. (One way out of this is to deny that\nPlato ever thought that knowledge is only of the Forms, as\nopposed to thinking that knowledge is paradigmatically of the\nForms. For this more tolerant Platonist view about perception see e.g.\nPhilebus 58d\u201362d, and Timaeus 27d ff.)\n\n\nThe jury argument seems to be a counter-example not only to\nD2 but also to D3, the thesis that\nknowledge is true belief with an account (provided we allow\nthat the jury \u201chave an account\u201d).\n\n\nA third problem about the jury argument is that Plato seems to offer\ntwo incompatible explanations of why the jury don\u2019t know: first that\nthey have only a limited time to hear the arguments (201b3, 172e1);\nand second that their judgement is second-hand (201b9).\n",
