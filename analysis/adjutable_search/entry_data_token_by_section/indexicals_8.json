In practice, many philosophers seem to employ\nthe following tests.\n\n\nSentence \\(S\\) is context-sensitive iff it is possible for\nthere to be two speakers who utter \\(S\\) (at the same time) and\nsay different things.\n\n\nSentence \\(S\\) is context-sensitive iff it is possible for\nthere to be a speaker who utters \\(S\\) and another speaker who\nutters the negation of \\(S\\) (at the same time), and yet the speakers do\nnot contradict each other.\n\n\nSentences that contain paradigm indexicals pass these tests. But\nsome opponents of pervasive context-sensitivity would reject them. For\ninstance, Soames and Bach might admit that Smith and Jones say\ndifferent things when they utter \u2018Every student has a\npencil\u2019, but they would not attribute this variation to the\nalleged context-sensitivity of the sentence and its quantifier phrase.\nRather, they would claim that Smith and Jones can use the sentence to\nsay, or assert, propositions that are distinct from the\nsentence\u2019s constant content.\n\n\nAnother test for context-sensitivity uses attitude ascriptions\n(Cappelen and Lepore 2005). Paradigmatic indexicals behave differently\nfrom non-indexicals in attitude ascriptions. Consider the following\nutterances.\n\n(9)\n\nSmith: \u201cMary is a philosopher.\u201d\nJones: \u201cSmith said that Mary is a philosopher.\u201d\n\n(10)\n\nSmith:  \u201cI am hungry.\u201d\nJones: \u201cSmith said that I am hungry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nJones disquotes Smith in both of these cases: that is,\nJones utters a says-that ascription whose embedded clause contains the\nvery sentence that Smith utters. But Jones\u2019s says-ascription in\n(9) is true (in Jones\u2019s context), whereas Jones\u2019s\nsays-ascriptions in (10) is false (in Jones\u2019s context). So,\ndisquotation can fail when the subject of the ascription utters a\ncontext-sensitive sentence. Thus, Cappelen and Lepore propose roughly\nthe following test for context-sensitivity.\n\n\n\\(S\\) is context-sensitive iff: it is possible that [(i)\n\\(A\\) utters sentence \\(S\\) and yet (ii) \u201c\\(A\\)\nsaid that \\(S\\)\u201d is false in some context].\n\n\nIf this test is accepted, then it could be used to argue against the\ncontext-sensitivity of many simple expressions that do not appear on\nKaplan\u2019s list. Consider, for instance, the gradable adjective\n\u2018rich\u2019. At first glance the following seems impossible:\nSmith utters \u2018George is rich\u2019 and yet \u2018Smith said\nthat George is rich\u2019 is false in some context. If so, then the\nabove test entails that the sentence is not context-sensitive. The\ndisquotation test, however, is controversial. For discussion of this\ntest and others, see Cappelen and Lepore 2005, Cappelen and Hawthorne\n2009, Leslie 2007.\n",
