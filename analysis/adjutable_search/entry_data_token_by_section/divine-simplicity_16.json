    "main_text": "The Modal Collapse Objection to DDS || Introduction to the Problem\n7.1 Introduction to the Problem\n\nThis final section elaborates a problem posed but not pursued in the\npreceding section: the problem of reconciling the simplicity of God\nwith the contingency of creatures and the states of affairs into which\nthey enter. If the simple God knows that Tom files his income taxes on\nApril 14th, how do we avoid the conclusion that Tom and his filing are\nmodally necessary? In the last few years, numerous articles have\nappeared pressing, and responding to, the claim that the commitments\nof DDS entail the collapse of modal distinctions. One way to present\nthe problem of modal collapse is as a tension between two commitments\nof classical Christian theism. The one commitment is to DDS. The other\nis to the contingency of creatures. Simplicity of God and contingency\nof creatures form a dyad the logical consistency of which is in\nquestion. Call it the problematic dyad. The gist of the modal collapse\nargument (MCA) is that DDS entails the absolute metaphysical necessity\nof creatures. If God is simple, then he is of course also absolutely\nnecessary (not possibly nonexistent) and this for the reason that, on\nDDS, essence and existence in God are one. It also seems to follow\nfrom the divine simplicity that any creative action that God performs,\nhe necessarily performs, and this for the reason that the simple God\nis pure act harboring no unrealized potentialities. (Indeed, he\nharbors no realized potentialities either since, as actus\npurus, he harbors no potentialities at all.) Given that God\ncreated our universe U, it follows that he could not have failed to\ncreate some universe and indeed the very one he did create, namely U.\nBear in mind that the validity of the MCA requires the auxiliary\npremise that, given divine omnipotence, divine creation cannot fail to\nsucceed. Thus there cannot be anything indeterministic about it: it\ncannot be that the divine creative act is absolutely necessary while\nthe effect of that act, U, is modally contingent. (The truth of this\nauxiliary premise is questioned by some, as we shall see.) Therefore,\nU cannot not exist given that God has created it, whence it follows\nthat U and everything in it exists of absolute metaphysical necessity\njust as God does. But then the first classical commitment, DDS,\ncollides with the second, the contingency of creatures, and the\ndistinction between necessity and contingency collapses. Both God and\nthe universe end up being absolutely necessary. If MCA succeeds, then\nmodal collapse is upon us, the problematic dyad is inconsistent, and\none of the classical commitments must be rejected, either the\nsimplicity of God or the contingency of creatures. If, on the other\nhand, MCA fails, then the dyad is presumably consistent and both\ncommitments may be upheld.\n",
