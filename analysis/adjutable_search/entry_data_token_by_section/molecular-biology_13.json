    "main_text": "Molecular Biology and General Philosophy of Science || Experimentation\n3.4 Experimentation\n\nThe history of molecular biology is in part the history of\nexperimental techniques designed to probe the macromolecular\nmechanisms found in living things. Philosophers in turn have looked to\nmolecular biology as a case study for understanding how\nexperimentation works in science\u2014how it contributes to\nscientific discovery, distinguishes correlation from causal and\nconstitutive relevance, and decides between competing hypotheses\n(Barwich and Baschir 2017). In all three cases, the concept of a\nmechanism is central to understanding the function of experimentation\nin molecular biology (also see the entry on experimentation in\nbiology).\n\nTake discovery. Throughout much of the twentieth century, philosophers\nof science treated scientific discovery as if it were off-limits to\nphilosophical analysis; philosophers could evaluate the rational\nprocess of confirmation, the argument went, but the psychological\nprocess of discovery (the \u201caha!\u201d moment) fell into the\nrealm of creativity (Popper 1965; see the entry on\n scientific discovery).\n Darden has countered with a focus on the strategies that scientists\nemploy to construct, evaluate, and revise mechanical explanations of\nphenomena; on her view, discovery is a piecemeal, incremental, and\niterative process of mechanism elucidation. In the 1950s and 1960s,\nfor example, scientists from both molecular biology and biochemistry\nemployed their own experimental strategies to elucidate the mechanisms\nof protein synthesis that linked DNA to the production of proteins.\nMolecular biologists moved forward from DNA using experimental\ntechniques such as x-ray crystallography and model building to\nunderstand how the structure of DNA dictated what molecules it could\ninteract with; biochemists simultaneously moved backward from the\nprotein products using in vitro experimental systems to\nunderstand the chemical reactions and chemical bonding necessary to\nbuild a protein. They met in the middle at RNA, ultimately leading to\nWatson\u2019s famous mechanism schema DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 protein.\nFar from being philosophically inscrutable, Darden points out that the\nmolecular biologists were \u201cforward chaining\u201d while the\nbiochemists were \u201cbackward chaining\u201d, using information\nabout the working entities and activities that they knew about to\ninfer what could come next or before in the mechanism of protein\nsynthesis (Darden 2006a: chapters 3, 12; Craver and Darden 2013:\nchapter 10).\n\nTudor Baetu builds on the contemporary philosophy of mechanism\nliterature as well to provide an account of how different experiments\nin molecular biology move from finding correlations, to establishing\ncausal relevance, to establishing constitutive relevance (Baetu\n2012b). Much recent philosophical attention has been given to the\ntransition from correlation to causal relevance. On a manipulationist\naccount of causal relevance, some factor X is determined to be\ncausally relevant to some outcome Y when interventions on\nX can be shown to produce the change in Y. Experiments\nfrom molecular biology often take this form, which Baetu calls\n\u201cone-variable experiments\u201d because they involve a single\nintervention made on X in the experiment to establish the\ncausal relevance to Y. But these one-variable experiments,\nBaetu cautions, do not necessarily provide information about the\ncausal mechanism that links X to Y. Is X causally\nrelevant to Y by way of mechanism A, mechanism B,\nor some other unknown mechanism? Baetu, drawing on his own\nexperimental research in molecular oncology, shows that scientists\nprobe the mechanical link by performing \u201ctwo-variable\nexperiments\u201d. In a two-variable experiment, two interventions\nare simultaneously made on the initial factor and some component\npostulated in the mechanical link, thereby establishing both causal\nand constitutive relevance. \n\nExperiments from molecular biology have also figured into\nphilosophical discussions about the possibility of \u201ccrucial\nexperiments\u201d. An experiment is taken to be a crucial experiment\nif it is devised so as to result in the confirmation of one hypothesis\nby way of refuting other competing hypotheses. But the very idea of a\ncrucial experiment, Pierre Duhem pointed out, assumes that the set of\nknown competing hypotheses contains all possible explanations of a\ngiven phenomenon such that the refutation of all but one of the\nhypotheses deductively ensures the confirmation of the hypothesis left\nstanding. However, if there are in fact unknown alternatives that\nweren\u2019t considered in the set of competing hypotheses, Duhem\nwarned, then the refutation cannot guarantee the confirmation of the\nlast hypothesis standing (also see the entry on Pierre Duhem). (Duhem\nactually raised two problems for crucial experiments\u2014the problem\nmentioned above, as well as the problem of auxiliary assumptions,\nwhich any hypothesis brings with it; for reasons of space, we will\nonly discuss the former here.) Marcel Weber (2009) has utilized a\nfamous experiment from molecular biology to offer a different vision\nof how crucial experiments work. After Watson and Crick discovered the\ndouble helical structure of DNA, molecular biologists turned their\nattention to how that macromolecule could be replicated (see\n Section 1.2\n above). The focus was in part on the fact that the DNA was twisted\ntogether in a helix, and so the challenge was figuring out what\nprocess could unwind and replicate that complexly wound molecule.\nThree competing hypotheses emerged, each with their own prediction\nabout the extent to which newly replicated DNA double helices\ncontained old DNA strands versus newly synthesized material:\nsemi-conservative replication, conservative replication, and\ndispersive replication. Matthew Meselson and Frank Stahl, at Cal Tech,\ndevised a method for testing among these competing hypotheses (see The\nSemi-Conservative Replication of DNA in\n Other Internet Resources).\n They grew E.coli on a medium that contained a unique,\nheavier form of nitrogen which could be taken up into the\nE.coli DNA; then they transferred that E.coli with\nheavy DNA to a medium with the more common, lighter form of nitrogen\nand let the E.coli replicate there. By then taking regular\nsamples of the replicating E.coli and examining the DNA of\nthe subsequent generations, they determined the extent to which the\nnew DNA was a mix of old DNA strands or newly synthesized material.\nThe result was a clear victory for semi-conservative replication, and\nthe Meselson-Stahl experiment became known as the \u201cmost\nbeautiful experiment in biology\u201d (Meselson and Stahl 1958;\nHolmes 2001). Weber argues that we should understand the quick uptake\nof Meselson and Stahl\u2019s experimental result as an instance of\ninference to the best explanation (as opposed to Duhem\u2019s\ndeductive characterization). Meselson and Stahl, Weber claims, took\nthe physiological mechanism of DNA replication and then embedded it in\nan \u201cexperimental mechanism\u201d; that experimental mechanism\nthen generated the data pattern of heavy-vs-light DNA in subsequent\nE.coli generations. Moreover, any hypothesis of DNA\nreplication had to satisfy mechanistic constraints imposed by what was\nalready known about the physiological mechanism\u2014that DNA was a\ndouble helix, and that the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA needed\nto be preserved in subsequent generations. So Duhem\u2019s concern\nabout unknown alternatives was alleviated because known mechanistic\nconstraints limited the set of possible hypotheses that could generate\nthe phenomenon. On Weber\u2019s reading, the mechanistic constraints\nculled the set of possible hypotheses for DNA replication to\nsemi-conservative replication, conservative replication, and\ndispersive replication; then, among that set, Meselson and Stahl\ndevised an experimental mechanism such that semi-conservative\nreplication was the best explanation of the data pattern they found.\n(For a critique, see Baetu 2017.)\n",
