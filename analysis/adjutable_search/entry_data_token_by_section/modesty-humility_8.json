For these accounts the\nvirtue may be compatible with ignorance or it may not\nbe\u2014it\u2019s not about one\u2019s beliefs at all. There is a\nwide range of such accounts and they see modesty or humility as being\nrooted in very different kinds of states and relations.\n\n\nHow compatible these various views are is an interpretive issue.\nRead as highlighting a key feature of modesty or humility, many do not\nrule the others out; attention, proportion, and kindness can all be\ncritical features of modesty. They may also be read, and often are\nintended, as describing the fundamental feature that explains all\nothers and in this sense they are genuine rivals that rule each other\nout.\n",
