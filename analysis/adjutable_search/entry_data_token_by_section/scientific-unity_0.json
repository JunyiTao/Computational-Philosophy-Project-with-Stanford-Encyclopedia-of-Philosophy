    "main_text": "Historical development in philosophy and science from Greek philosophy to Logical Empiricism in America || From Greek thought to Western science\n1.1 From Greek thought to Western science\n\nUnity has a history as well as a logic. Different formulations and\ndebates express intellectual and other resources and interests in\ndifferent contexts. Questions about unity belong partly in a tradition\nof thought that can be traced back to pre-Socratic Greek cosmology, in\nparticular to the preoccupation with the question of the One and the\nMany. In what senses is the world and, as a result, our knowledge of\nit one? A number of representations of the world in terms of a few\nsimple constituents that were considered fundamental emerged:\nParmenides\u2019 static substance, Heraclitus\u2019 flux of\nbecoming, Empedocles\u2019 four elements, Democritus\u2019 atoms,\nPythagoras\u2019 numbers, Plato\u2019s forms, and Aristotle\u2019s\ncategories. The underlying question of the unity of our types of\nknowledge was explicitly addressed by Plato in the Sophist as\nfollows: \u201cKnowledge also is surely one, but each part of it that\ncommands a certain field is marked off and given a special name proper\nto itself. Hence language recognizes many arts and many forms of\nknowledge\u201d (Sophist, 257c). Aristotle asserted in\nOn the Heavens that knowledge concerns what is primary, and\ndifferent \u201csciences\u201d know different kinds of causes; it is\nmetaphysics that comes to provide knowledge of the underlying\nkind.\n\nWith the advent and expansion of Christian monotheism, the\norganization of knowledge reflected the idea of a world governed by\nthe laws dictated by God, its creator and legislator. From this\ntradition emerged encyclopedic efforts such as the\nEtymologies, compiled in the sixth century by the Andalusian\nIsidore, Bishop of Seville, the works of the Catalan Ramon Llull in\nthe Middle Ages and those of the Frenchman Petrus Ramus in the\nRenaissance. Llull introduced iconic tree-diagrams and\nforest-encyclopedias representing the organization of different\ndisciplines including law, medicine, theology and logic. He also\nintroduced more abstract diagrams\u2014not unlike some found in\nCabbalistic and esoteric traditions\u2014in an attempt to\ncombinatorially encode the knowledge of God\u2019s creation in a\nuniversal language of basic symbols. Their combination would be\nexpected to generate knowledge of the secrets of creation and help\narticulate knowledge of universal order (mathesis\nuniversalis), which would, in turn, facilitate communication with\ndifferent cultures and their conversion to Christianity. Ramus\nintroduced diagrams representing dichotomies and gave prominence to\nthe view that the starting point of all philosophy is the\nclassification of the arts and sciences. The encyclopedia organization\nof knowledge served the project of its preservation and\ncommunication.\n\nThe emergence of a distinctive tradition of scientific thought\naddressed the question of unity through the designation of a\nprivileged method, which involved a privileged language and set of\nconcepts. Formally, at least, it was modeled after the Euclidean ideal\nof a system of geometry. In the late-sixteenth century, Francis Bacon\nheld that one unity of the sciences was the result of our organization\nof records of discovered material facts in the form of a pyramid with\ndifferent levels of generalities. These could be classified in turn\naccording to disciplines linked to human faculties. Concomitantly, the\ncontrolled interaction with phenomena of study characterized so-called\nexperimental philosophy. In accordance with at least three\ntraditions\u2014the Pythagorean tradition, the Bible\u2019s dictum\nin the Book of Wisdom and the Italian commercial tradition of\nbookkeeping\u2014Galileo proclaimed at the turn of the seventeenth\ncentury that the Book of Nature had been written by God in the\nlanguage of mathematical symbols and geometrical truths, and in it,\nthe story of Nature\u2019s laws was told in terms of a reduced set of\nobjective, quantitative primary qualities: extension, quantity of\nmatter and motion. A persisting rhetorical role for some form of\ntheological unity of creation should not be neglected when considering\npre-twentieth-century attempts to account for the possibility and\ndesirability of some form of scientific knowledge. Throughout the\nseventeenth century, mechanical philosophy and Descartes\u2019 and\nNewton\u2019s systematization from basic concepts and first laws of\nmechanics became the most promising framework for the unification of\nnatural philosophy. After the demise of Laplacian molecular physics in\nthe first half of the nineteenth century, this role was taken over by\nether mechanics and, unifying forces and matter, energy physics.\n",
