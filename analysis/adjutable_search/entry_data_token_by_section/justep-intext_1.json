    "main_text": "Accessibility and Internalism\n2. Accessibility and Internalism\n\nMost likely, defenders of internalism about knowledge will be unfazed\nby this rejection. Much more plausible, and also much more likely to\nbe the actual view internalists have in mind, is Accessibility\nknowledge internalism. It requires only that one can become aware of\nthe knowledge basis, either by easy and quick reflection in some\ncases, or by more difficult and lengthy reflection in others. What\nmatters, however, is not the temporal length of the reflection, but\nrather that this is an awareness one can achieve merely by reflection.\nAnd there is something right about this, because we all engage in this\nsort of activity all the time, often with good success. We can, then,\nfocus attention on Accessibility knowledge internalism.\n\nAccess to a knowledge basis can itself be thought of in two ways. One\nmight be capable of attaining awareness of what is in fact one's\nknowledge basis, but without also being capable of being aware that\nthis item is one's knowledge basis. Or, one might actually be capable\nof attaining awareness that some item is one's knowledge basis. The\ndifference is this: in the first case, one might have an awareness\ndirected at what is in fact a knowledge basis, but without realizing\nthat it is one's knowledge basis; while in the second sort of case,\none's awareness is directed at the fact that some item is one's\nknowledge basis. \n\nBy making use of this distinction in the knowledge case, we can\nspecify two different versions of Accessibility knowledge internalism\n(AKI), a weak form and a strong form. (Hereafter it will be presumed\nthat we are speaking only of Accessibility knowledge internalism, and\nwe can speak of weak and strong AKI.)\n\nWeak AKI:\n\nOne knows some proposition p only if one can become aware by\nreflection of what is in fact one's knowledge basis for p.\nStrong AKI:\n\nOne knows some proposition p only if one can become aware by\nreflection that some item is one's knowledge basis for p.\n\n\nIn the geese example, given earlier, the weak version would tell us\nthat one can become aware by reflection of the fact that someone has\ntestified to the presence of geese. By contrast, the strong version\nwould go beyond this and say that one can become aware by reflection\nthat this testimony counts as one's knowledge basis for one's belief\nabout the geese.\n\nThe two definitions as presently stated may be thought of as\ncomplete knowledge basis versions of knowledge\ninternalism, for they both demand a form of accessibility to all of\none's knowledge basis for any given piece of knowledge. There are,\nhowever, a great many cases where one has a multiplicity of knowledge\nbases for an item of knowledge. For instance, if one comes to know\nthat p as a result of a lengthy piece of reasoning, as in the\nconstruction of a mathematical proof with many steps, then one has\nmany knowledge bases standing behind one's knowledge that p.\nOr we can think of perceptual cases where one comes to have knowledge\nbased upon a complex assortment of perceptual cues, all of which count\nas knowledge bases, but only some of which are accessible by\nreflection. It would be much too stringent a requirement to insist\nthat a person must be capable of becoming aware by reflection of\nall of her knowledge bases, for every piece of knowledge she\nthen possesses. If that were a requirement, then probably neither weak\nnor strong AKI would have any plausibility at all. Hence, the two\ndefinitions require some amendment, which we can easily provide.\n\nWeak AKI:\n\nOne knows some proposition p only if one can become aware by\nreflection of what is in fact some essential part of one's knowledge\nbasis for p.\nStrong AKI:\n\nOne knows some proposition p only if one can become aware by\nreflection that some item k is some essential part of one's\nknowledge basis for p.\n\n\nWe may think of these two definitions of knowledge internalism as\npartial knowledge basis accounts, for each requires\nonly some form of accessibility to some element or elements of one's\nknowledge basis. We will confine attention to these two partial\nknowledge basis accounts.\n\nThe use of the term \u2018essential\u2019 in weak and strong AKI is\nimportant. Imagine that one's knowledge basis for proposition\np is quite complex, including a number of different elements.\nPerhaps one has amassed a good bit of evidence concerning p,\nand the cumulative effect is to make up one's knowledge basis for\np. It may be that some element in this evidence base is\ninessential, in the sense that even if one were to delete\nthat element, the remaining evidence would still constitute a\nknowledge basis for p. A case like this might well arise when\none has amassed an over-abundance of evidence, perhaps with the aim of\nbeing especially careful and diligent. Without the use of the term\n\u2018essential\u2019 in the above definitions, we would allow for\ncases in which a person was capable of becoming aware of what was in\nfact an inessential part of her knowledge basis for\np. This would unfairly saddle the internalist with an\nunnecessarily implausible position, and the use of the term\n\u2018essential\u2019 is designed to avoid that consequence.\n\nKnowledge externalism, at least with respect to accessibility, is\ngenerally regarded as just the denial of knowledge internalism. If we\nhad rested content with knowledge internalism as we first stated it,\nwhich required some form of accessibility to all of one's\nknowledge basis, then knowledge externalism would just be the denial\nof that internalist position. But that would not be an interesting\nknowledge externalist position. For, denying that one can access by\nreflection all of one's knowledge basis for a proposition p\nis perfectly compatible with one being able to access some of one's\nknowledge basis for p, indeed some essential part of that\nbasis. Knowledge externalism, however, wants to incorporate the idea\nthat in some cases one cannot access any of one's knowledge\nbasis. Knowledge externalism, then, aims to deny the partial knowledge\nbasis accounts. As we have two of the latter we will naturally expect\nto find two versions of externalism with respect to accessibility. A\nweak version of accessibility externalism for knowledge will deny\nmerely the strong version of AKI, thus:\n\nWeak AKE:\n\nIt is false that: one knows some proposition p only if one\ncan become aware by reflection that some item or other k is a\nknowledge basis for p.\n\n\nWeak externalism of this variety is perfectly compatible with one form\nof accessibility internalism concerning knowledge, namely weak AKI.\nDefenders of externalism, however, most likely would be interested in\ngoing beyond this weak form to an externalist position that is more\nwide-ranging. This stronger version of externalism would be this:\n\nStrong AKE:\n\nIt is false that: one knows some proposition p only if one\ncan become aware by reflection of some essential knowledge basis for\np.\n\n\nThis position is thus denying that the ability to become aware of an\nessential knowledge basis is a necessary condition on having\nknowledge. The proponent of strong AKE can allow that in some cases\none might have this ability. Her denial is that one has it in all\ncases, for each piece of knowledge one happens to possess.\n\nStrong AKE is so called because it rejects even the weak version of\nknowledge internalism. And since weak knowledge internalism is\nincluded in strong knowledge internalism as a part, as per comments\nmade above concerning statements A and B, we may say that strong AKE\nalso rejects strong knowledge internalism. Put more generally, we can\nsay that strong AKE rejects knowledge internalism across the\nboard.\n",
