    "main_text": "Speaker Implicature and Intention\n15. Sentence Implicature and Convention\n\nWhereas what a speaker implicates depends on the particular\nspeaker\u2019s intentions, what a sentence implicates on\nDavis\u2019s theory depends on the conventions of the community of\nspeakers who use the language. To know or explain sentence\nimplicatures is to know or explain the relevant conventions. This is\nas true of generalized conversational implicatures as it is of\nimplicatures that are conventional in Grice\u2019s sense\n(\u00a72).\n\nWhen Grice talked about conventional implicatures he was referring to\nsemantic implicatures, like [3c]. These exist because of\nconventions that give individual words or syntactic structures their\nmeanings. The queen is English and therefore brave implicates\n\u201cBeing brave follows from being English\u201d because it is\nconventional for English speakers to use \u201ctherefore\u201d with\na certain meaning, which determines the implicature. A\nconversational sentence implicature is not determined by the\nmeaning of the sentence used, even when sentences with the same form\nare conventionally used with that implicature. It is a second-order\nconvention: a convention to use a sentence of a given form with an\nimplicature that is not part of its meaning. The common modes and\nfigures of speech are also second-order conventions, but not\nrestricted to sentences with a particular form. A language is defined\nby first-order lexical and syntactic conventions, not by second-order\nimplicature conventions. In this respect conversational implicature\nconventions are like naming conventions, word formation rules,\nintonation rules, speech act rituals (e.g., saying \u201cThis is\nN\u201d when answering a telephone), and indirect speech act\nconventions (e.g., asking \u201cCan I get an N?\u201d to\nrequest an\n N).[79]\n Second-order conventions are not as arbitrary, though, because there\nis always some antecedent relation between what the sentence means and\nthe implicature that makes it natural to use one to convey the other.\nImplicature conventions promote style, politeness, and efficiency as\nwell as communication.\n\nLike other second-order linguistic conventions, conversational\nimplicature conventions differ in their cross-linguistic spread.\nWhereas the quantity implicature of \u201csome\u201d has been found\nin all observed languages (Horn 1989), common metaphors differ as much\nfrom language to language as the idioms that evolve from them do. The\nfact that regularities in implicature obtain cross-linguistically is\ncompatible with their being arbitrary and conventional. Witness the\npractice of using \u201c?\u201d and rising intonation to mark\nquestions. Why some implicatures are common to more languages than\nothers is an open question on any view. To the extent that\nimplicatures are conventional, it is a question for historical\nlinguistics.\n\nKnowledge of sentence implicatures is a crucial component of\nlinguistic\n competence.[80]\n Speakers unaware of them are likely to mislead their audience.\nImagine the possibilities if an oblivious speaker said Your\nhusband saw a woman to the subject\u2019s wife. Hearers without\nsuch knowledge are likely to either misinterpret or fail to fully\nunderstand the speaker. Sentence implicatures, both semantic and\nconversational, resemble idioms and figures of speech in being picked\nup by native speakers from other speakers in the course of learning\nthe language. Sentence implicatures thus perpetuate themselves from\none generation to the next as sentence meanings do. Recent metaphors\nare special in being picked up by adults, and are liable to become\nidioms if they pass on to new generations.\n\nAn impressive body of research has attempted to discern general\nregularities in the multitude of conversational implicature\nconventions associated with a language. Wierzbicka (2003) has studied\nhow implicature conventions reflect broader \u201ccultural\nscripts\u201d. Others study how the implicatures of a sentence are\nrelated to the implicatures of compound sentences in which the\nsentence is embedded (Gazdar 1979; Levinson 2000: \u00a72.5.1;\nSauerland & Stateva 2007)\u2014the question raised by example\n (16).\n\nThe most influential work on conversational implicature conventions\ndescribes \u201cHorn\n scales\u201d.[81]\n Horn (1972, 1989) observed that the quantifiers all, most, many,\nsome form a scale with the following properties. Instances of\n\u201c___ S are P\u201d with one term entail\ninstances with any term to the right, but not to the left; the terms\nare thus ordered by logical strength. Moreover, the result of\nsubstituting one term implicates the denial of the result of\nsubstituting any term to the left, but not to the right. In the\nnegative context \u201cIt is not the case that ___ S are\nP\u201d, the logical and pragmatic relations are reversed.\nOther Horn scales are \u27e8necessarily, actually,\npossibly\u27e9, \u27e8certainly, probably,\npossibly\u27e9, and \u27e8must, should, may\u27e9. Horn\n(1989: \u00a74.5) correlates the existence of scales with the absence\nof certain lexical items, such as a quantifier meaning \u201cnot\n all\u201d.[82]\n Levinson (2000: 156) looked for a generalization that would cover\nthese cases but not scales like \u27e8Over 90%, over 10%,\nsome\u27e9 which have the same logical relations as Horn scales\nbut not the pragmatic relations. One generalization is that the items\non a Horn scale are widely and frequently used monolexemes. A\ncompanion problem is to explain why some common monolexemes with\nsimilar logical relations lack the pragmatic relations, as\nseveral illustrates. Given the conventional nature of\ngeneralized conversational implicatures, there may be no systematic\n(\u201csynchronic\u201d) explanation. All languages are\n\u201cirregular\u201d to some extent. For example, the regular\npattern for adjectives in English is that of tall, taller,\ntallest. But there are exceptions, such as good, better,\nbest. No one expects that anything other than a historical\n(\u201cdiachronic\u201d) explanation exists for these facts.\n\nThe literature on implicature is enormous and still growing. This\nentry, regrettably, had to ignore many valuable contributions.\n",
