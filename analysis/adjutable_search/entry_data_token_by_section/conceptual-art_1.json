    "main_text": "Conceptual Art \u2013 What Is It? || The Limits of Art and the Role of Artists\n1.2 The Limits of Art and the Role of Artists\n\nFirst and foremost, conceptual art challenges our intuitions\nconcerning the limits of what may count as art and what it is an\nartist does. It does so, on the one hand, by postulating ever more\ncomplex objects as candidates for the status of \u2018artwork\u2019,\nand, on the other hand, by distancing the task of the artist from the\nactual making and manipulating of the artistic material.\n\nA characteristic way in which conceptual art explores the boundaries\nof the artwork is by a process of questioning where the realm of the\nartistic ends and that of utility begins. Continuing the tradition of\nMarcel Duchamp\u2019s readymades such as Fountain, or\nBottlerack, it sets out to overthrow our traditional\nconceptions of what an art object should be made of and what it should\nlook like. The artwork is a process rather than a\nmaterial thing, and as such it is no longer something that\ncan be grasped merely by seeing, hearing or touching the end product\nof that process. The notion of agency in art-making is thus\nparticularly emphasised. In many cases, the \u2018art-making\u2019\nand the \u2018artwork\u2019 come together, because what is sought is\nan identification of the notion of the work of art with the conceptual\nactivity of the artist. Conceptual art, politicised and influenced by\nevents such as the \u2018May Days\u2019 in Paris (1968), the\n\u2018Hot Autumn\u2019 in Italy (1969), the Vietnam War, and the\nrise of feminism, promotes a rapprochement between art-making\nand criticism \u2013 both artistic and social \u2013 by raising\nquestions about the products of artistic activities and the very\npurpose of art. To use the words of Joseph Kosuth, it \u2018annexes\nthe functions of the critic, and makes a middle-man\nunnecessary.\u2019 (Guercio 1999, 39).\n",
