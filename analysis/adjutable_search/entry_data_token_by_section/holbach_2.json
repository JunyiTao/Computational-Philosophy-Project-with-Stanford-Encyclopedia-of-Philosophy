    "main_text": "Ethics: Virtue for the Sake of Happiness\n3. Ethics: Virtue for the Sake of Happiness\n\n\nHolbach\u2019s ethics is naturalistic in the sense described. Like\nhis major influence in this area, Spinoza, he undertakes to explain\nhuman beings with the same clarity and rigor that others explain\ngeometry (El\u00e9ments de la morale universelle,\nPreface). The laws that Holbach depends upon in accounting for human\nnature are primarily psychological laws and may be peculiar to human\nbeings. For Holbach, like Spinoza and Hobbes, holds that each person\nseeks his own preservation (System of Nature, 40; cf,\nSpinoza\u2019s Ethics IIIp9 and Hobbes\u2019s De\nHomine, Chap. 11\u2014Holbach\u2019s is still the most widely\navailable French translation of the latter). As both of these authors\ndo, Holbach associates the ends of action also with happiness, so that\nhappiness and self-preservation are, in his ethics, generally speaking\nrelated, and an individual\u2019s interest is understood by Holbach\nin terms of either (and where he distinguishes between them, both) of\nthese. \n\n\nEthics on Holbach\u2019s account, then, amounts to enlightened\nself-interest, vice to a failure to recognize the means to one\u2019s\ninterest, and moral rules to hypothetical imperatives which dictate the\nmeans to happiness or self-preservation:\n[Man] was ignorant of his true interests; hence his\nirregularities, his intemperance, his shameful voluptuousness, with\nthat long train of vices to which he has abandoned himself, at the\nexpense of his preservation, at the risk of his permanent felicity.\n[System of Nature, 14]\n\n\nBecause people desire what morality provides, they will as a matter of\ncourse be motivated to do what is moral, provided they know what that\nis. The ignorance that Holbach describes here, however, is what causes\npeople to fail to act rightly. So what ethics requires is an\ninvestigation into ignorance: In what respects are people ignorant?\nWhat are the most dangerous forms of ignorance? How is ignorance to be\novercome? \n\n\nOne of the most dangerous kinds of ignorance, on Holbach\u2019s analysis,\nis an ignorance of nature and, in particular, of the causes of good and\nevil in it. Like Spinoza, Holbach argues that we tend to personify\nnature, projecting our interests and purposes onto matter that is, in\nfact, different from us (System of Nature, App. 17; cf,\nSpinoza\u2019s Ethics I, App.). This produces, on Holbach\u2019s\naccount, the belief in God and other religious beliefs (such as the\nbelief in heaven and hell and immortality) which in turn cause us to\npursue self-preservation in misguided ways:\nThe ignorance of natural causes created Gods, and imposture\nmade them terrible. Man lived unhappy, because he was told that God had\ncondemned him to misery. He never entertained a wish of breaking his\nchains, as he was taught, that stupidity, that the renouncing of\nreason, mental debility, and spiritual debasement, were the means of\nobtaining eternal felicity. [System of Nature,\n349\u2013350]\n\n\nHolbach was notorious in the 18th century for his atheism and for his\ncriticisms of Christianity. Indeed today these topics most frequently\nengage philosophers and historians who study Holbach (see Kors 2005\nand Fonnesu 2006, for example), and Holbach continues to be a hero of\ndefenders of atheism, including the popular philosopher Michel\nOnfrey. There is no doubt that a great deal of what Holbach wrote was\ninflammatory and intended to be so. However, the fact that at least\nsome of his polemics, furious though they may have been, arose in the\ncontext of developing an account of virtue should mitigate the\nimpression of Holbach as a purely destructive thinker or (merely) a\nlover of scandal. His criticism of religion, and of Catholicism in\nparticular, is founded at least in part in the conviction that\nreligion is the source of vice and unhappiness and that virtue can\nonly be fostered in people who seek to preserve themselves in the world\nof their immediate acquaintance:\nRenounce your vague hopes; disengage yourself from\noverwhelming fears\u2026do not attempt to plunge your views into an\nimpenetrable future\u2026 \u2026Only think then, of making\nyourself happy in that existence which is known to you; if you would\npreserve yourself, be temperate, moderate, and reasonable; if you seek\nto render your existence durable, do not be prodigal of pleasure;\nabstain from everything that can be harmful to yourself or\nothers. [System of Nature, 162;\ncf. Spinoza\u2019s Ethics IVP42C2S]\n\n\nHolbach\u2019s ethics, as Rousseau recognized, is not nearly as\nrevisionary as his theology. As this passage makes clear, his\nconception of human virtue is quite traditional. Preservation and\nhappiness, as Holbach conceives them, involve most of the same\npractices that the religious views Holbach denounces require for\neternal preservation and felicity. Perhaps the principal practical\ndifference between morality as Holbach conceives it and the Christian\nmorality as Holbach understands it lies in the self-abnegation Holbach\nfinds valued in Christian morality. For Holbach, temperance, moderation\nand so on are virtues that one acquires out of a love for pleasure and\nlife. On the other hand, he takes these virtues, as they are understood\ntraditionally, to involve an unhealthy denial of one\u2019s love for wine,\nfood and other familiar pleasures. Temperance and moderation, for\nHolbach are the best means to the enjoyment of wine and food, whereas\nin the views he criticizes they are virtues by which we deny the value\nof such enjoyment.\n",
