A legal right is inviolable or absolute if, as a matter of\nlaw, it preempts or otherwise overcomes all possible\nconflicting legal reasons. \n\nIn principle, legal rights\u2019 preemptory force can be absolute. An\nexample from international law is the human right against torture\nenshrined in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, proclaiming that \u201c[n]o one shall be subjected\nto torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\npunishment\u201d. Another example is Justice Hugo Black\u2019s\nFirst Amendment jurisprudence. The Amendment\nstates:\n\n\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of\nspeech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to\nassemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n\n\nAccording to Justice Black,\n\n\n\u201cno law \u2026 abridging\u201d means no law\nabridging \u2026 The First Amendment, which is the\nsupreme law of the land, has thus fixed its own value on freedom of\nspeech and press by putting these freedoms wholly \u201cbeyond the\nreach\u201d of federal power to abridge \u2026 Consequently\n\u2026 I do not believe that any federal agencies, including\nCongress and this Court, have power or authority to subordinate speech\nand press to what they think are \u201cmore important\ninterests\u201d. (Smith v. United States [1959],\n157\u2013158) \n\n\nThe view that rights are absolute is often associated with\nDworkin\u2019s metaphor of \u201crights as trumps\u201d. Yet, while\nDworkin was of the view that rights trump certain utilitarian concerns\nas well as considerations that are illegitimate in public policy (such\nas racism) (1984; 1986: 388), he did not argue for the absolutist\nposition (Dworkin 1977: 93, 190\u2013191; see Waldron 2000). Focusing\nnot on legal but on moral rights, Nozick comes close to rights\nabsolutism, yet even he may have had some doubts (Nozick 1974:\n28\u201333; see Thomson 1977 [1986: 55\u201365]). \n\nIn fact, preemptoriness does not necessarily entail absoluteness. And\nwhile there are, arguably, some absolute rights (see Gewirth 1981),\nsuch rights are not easy to come by in law or in morality (Feinberg\n1973: 79\u201383, 94\u201397). Perhaps this is because when\nconfronted with extreme cases, or with great human need, or with\nconflicting weighty rights, or with overwhelming public concerns,\nabsolutism is morally implausible. Moreover, were legal rights\nabsolute, the law would run the risk of becoming mired in intractable\ncontradictions between various conflicting yet absolute rights. \n\nThat said, one path towards turning absolutism more plausible begins\nwith noticing that absoluteness does not denote scope (Feinberg 1973:\n80\u201383; Dworkin 1977: 261; Schauer 1979: 903\u2013905; Gewirth\n1981: 3\u20134). Accordingly, if construed more narrowly in scope, or\nif oriented towards narrow core cases, or if tempered through\nexceptions, legal rights can sidestep clashes with other legal rights\nand with highly weighty conflicting moral considerations, thereby\nkeeping their absoluteness while avoiding moral implausibility and\nlegal intractability. \n\nYet, under such an approach much of what determines what the law is\nare considerations not of right but of the parameters of rights,\nshrinking the role of legal rights as legal reasons and pushing them\ncloser to \u201cright as outcome\u201d. Moreover, a legal system of\nabsolute rights of a narrow scope would likely entail highly\nconvoluted rights, rife with numerous exceptions and qualifications to\nthe point of impracticality. In fact, constructing a working\nfrictionless system of absolute legal rights that are harmonious with\neach other as well as with any other weighty consideration, is\npractically impossible. \n\nAccordingly, rights\u2019 preemptory quality is likely more\naccurately described not in terms of \u201ctrumping\u201d but as\nsetting normative \u201cthresholds\u201d\u2014excluding many, yet\nrarely all possible conflicting considerations (Lyons 1994: 152;\nGriffin 2008: 76). Thus, legal rights are mostly\ndefeasible\u2014certainly in principle and at times also in actual\nlegal practice (Jones 1994: 50\u201356; Wellman 1995: 251\u2013255).\n\n\n\u201cStringency\u201d stands for the extent of a right\u2019s\nperemptoriness. For instance, an absolute right is infinitely\nstringent (Thomson 1977 [1986: 55]). A right\u2019s stringency is a\nfunction of the scope of conflicting reasons that the right trumps or\nexcludes, and of how demanding are the duties grounded in the right\n(Kamm 2002: 489).\n\nThe type of reasons that rights can clash with are varied, and can\ninclude reasons such as other rights, justice, and welfare (for a\ndiscussion in the context of moral human rights see Griffith 2008:\n58\u201366). \n\nIn law, rights vary in stringency. The most stringent legal rights are\ntypically those rights the law deems \u201cfundamental\u201d or\n\u201ccore\u201d, or rights protective of particularly significant\ninterests or values. These regularly include\n civil\n and\n human rights.\n The extent of a right\u2019s stringency and the legal doctrines for\ndetermining it are matters of normative jurisprudence, political and\nconstitutional theory, and judicial practice. The same is true of the\nweight of rights, discussed in the section below. Common\nconsiderations relevant to such assessments include the ingredients of\nthe legal right\u2019s moral justification, background social and\npolitical values and commitments, expediency, and institutional\nconsiderations. \n",
