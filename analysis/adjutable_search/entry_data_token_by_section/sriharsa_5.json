    "main_text": "Epistemology || Knowledge as Awareness Produced by the Right Method\n2.2 Knowledge as Awareness Produced by the Right Method\n\nImmediately after considering Shells,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a entertains the following modification of the\n\u201ctrue awareness\u201d account of knowledge.\n\n\nknowledge ii An awareness-episode has the\nstatus of knowledge if and only if it is a true, non-recollective\nawareness-episode that is produced by a method which never produces\nfalse awareness-episodes\n\n(avyabhic\u0101rikara\u1e47ajanya).[11]\n\n\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a goes on to gloss this proposal as saying that\nknowledge consists in non-recollective awareness of the truth produced\nby a set of causal conditions\n(k\u0101ra\u1e47a-s\u0101magr\u012b)\u2014which includes\nthe method (kara\u1e47a) as well as background causal\nconditions\u2014that never produce false awareness (see\n footnote 11).\n Presumably, the defender of this proposal would want to say that in\ncases of accidentally true awareness, the causal conditions that\nproduce the awareness-episode could easily have given rise to false\nawareness. For instance, in Shells, the causal conditions\nthat give rise to the relevant episode of awareness could also have\nproduced the awareness that the bookie had five shells in his hand\nwhen he in fact had four. In this respect, knowledge\nii resembles anti-luck conditions like safety and\nsensitivity, both of which appeal to methods that don\u2019t\nproduce false beliefs in nearby\n possibilities.[12]\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a sees a danger of extensional inadequacy here:\nthe new clause in the definition of knowledge is unable to rule out\naccidentally true awareness from the scope of knowledge.\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s argument relies on the following\nprinciple.\n\n\nthe sufficiency principle If an\nawareness-episode is true and non-recollective, then the causal\nconditions that give rise to the relevant awareness-episode are\ntogether causally sufficient to give rise to a true\nawareness-episode, i.e., they couldn\u2019t give rise to a false\n awareness-episode.[13]\n\n\n\n\nThe principle in fact falls out of \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015besika opponent\u2019s view. For most\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015besika philosophers, the status of an\nawareness-episode as knowledge and therefore its status as true and\nnon-recollective is causally explained solely by certain epistemic\nvirtues (gu\u1e47a) that reside in the causal conditions\nthat give rise to\n it.[14]\n If this is the case, then the truth of a non-recollective\nawareness-episode should be explained solely in terms of those\nepistemic virtues. Hence, if an awareness-episode is true and\nnon-recollective, then the causal conditions that give rise to the\nrelevant awareness-episode\u2014in virtue of the epistemic virtues\nthat reside in them\u2014should suffice to give rise to a\ntrue awareness-episode in every case, i.e., they\ncouldn\u2019t give rise to a false awareness-episode.\n\nNow, if the sufficiency principle is correct,\nthen the same set of causal conditions that gives rise to an\naccidentally true awareness-episode couldn\u2019t possibly give rise\nto a false awareness-episode. Otherwise, we would be committed to\nsomething absurd, namely that even false awareness-episodes are true.\nThe only other option is to grant that the set of causal conditions\nthat gives rise to a true awareness-episode can only give rise to true\nawareness-episodes. In that case, the proposed definition of knowledge\nwould be incapable of ruling out instances of accidentally true\nawareness.\n\nHowever, one might suspect that the sufficiency\nprinciple is not true after all. For instance, in cases like\nShells, it does seem as if the causal conditions that give\nrise the agent\u2019s awareness could also produce false awareness.\nMoreover, nothing \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a says in fact decisively\nsupports this\n principle.[15]\n But it is worth pointing out that \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a needs\nnothing as strong as the sufficiency principle\nto make the point that he wants to make. The general objection seems\nto be this. Suppose we explain the status of any awareness-episode as\nknowledge by appealing to the good-making features of the relevant\ncausal mechanism\u2014the putative epistemic virtues of the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher\u2014that gives rise to\nit. We may say that these epistemic virtues are the ones that\nguarantee that the awareness-episode won\u2019t be false. But an\naccidentally true awareness-episode is one which is produced by a\ncausal mechanism that lacks all of these knowledge-conducive epistemic\nvirtues, and that is why it isn\u2019t guaranteed to be true. This\nexplains why such awareness-episodes seem true as a matter of luck.\nBut the problem is this. No matter what these truth-guaranteeing\nepistemic virtues are, it will always be possible to find episodes of\nawareness which are produced by causal mechanisms that possess all\nthese virtues, but nevertheless only accidentally true. In this sense,\neven if the new definition of knowledge is fleshed out in terms of\nknowledge-conducive epistemic virtues, it won\u2019t be able to rule\nout cases of knowledge-destroying epistemic luck. So, the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher\u2019s appeal to causal\nconditions that would never give rise to false awareness-episodes\nseems mistaken. \n\nHere is another kind of method-based solution that\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a takes up a little later in the text (KKh\n238).\n\n\nknowledge iii Knowledge is the\nnon-mnemonic awareness of the truth produced by a non-defective method\n(adu\u1e63\u1e6dakara\u1e47ajanya).\n\n\n\nThe rationale for the proposal, once again, is clear. In cases like\nShells, there is something defective about the manner in\nwhich the agent arrives at his or her final awareness: in the first\ncase, it is a blind guess, and in the latter two, it is a perceptual\nerror.\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a notes that this definition won\u2019t be\ninformative unless his opponent specifies what defectiveness consists\nin. Suppose a defender of knowledge iii says,\n\n\n\nIt is a distinctive property which is conducive to the production of\ncontrary awareness-episodes and which is possessed by the\ncausal conditions that give rise to such awareness-episodes\n(vipar\u012btaj\u00f1\u0101naprayojakas taddhetugato\nvi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e25). (KKh 238) \n\n\nBut what are contrary awareness-episodes? The opponent cannot say that\ncontrary awareness-episodes are just false\nawareness-episodes, because that would make this proposal equivalent\nto knowledge ii; for, now, knowledge\niii will just entail that knowledge is\nnon-mnemonic awareness of the truth produced by a method that\ndoesn\u2019t possess a property that is conducive to the production\nof false awareness-episodes. If the qualifier \u201ccontrary\u201d\nis supposed to rule out knowledge, then the opponent won\u2019t be\nable to define knowledge in knowledge-independent terms. Therefore,\nher definition of knowledge will be circular.\n\nOnce again, the charge of circularity generalizes quite nicely to\nother proposals that appeal to the notion of method or\ncausal process. The general argument is that if we want to\nrule out accidentally true awareness from the scope of knowledge by\nappealing to the non-defectiveness of methods, then we need a\nnon-circular account of epistemic defects that can be stated in\nknowledge-independent terms. \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a is skeptical\nthat such a non-circular account is available.\n",
