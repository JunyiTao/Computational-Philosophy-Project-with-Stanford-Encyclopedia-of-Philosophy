Life and Works\n\nSimone de Beauvoir was born on January 9, 1908 in Paris, France. Her\nparents, Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir and Fran\u00e7oise\n(n\u00e9e) Brasseur provided Beauvoir and her younger sister\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne, often referred to by her nickname\n\u201cPoupette,\u201d with a traditional bourgeois, Catholic\nupbringing. Beauvoir spent much of her childhood rebelling against the\nvalues of her faith and bourgeois ideology. The disdain for the latter\nwould continue throughout her adult life. In her childhood, Beauvoir\nvowed to never become a housewife or mother and admired her\nfather\u2019s intelligence. He introduced the young Beauvoir to great\nworks of literature and encouraged her to write. She pursued this out\nof her own interest, writing stories and keeping diaries throughout\nher girlhood, and more formally in her educational training at the\nprivate Catholic school for girls, the Institut Adeline D\u00e9sir.\nAt school, she formed an intimate bond with Elizabeth Mabille, or\nZaza. Together, the two confronted and resisted the rigid expectations\nof bourgeois, Catholic femininity. When Zaza died of meningitis in\n1929, Beauvoir suffered intense heartbreak. She fictionalized this\nheartbreak and their intimacy in the novel Inseparable\n(2021), which was written in 1954 but deemed \u201ctoo\nintimate\u201d to publish during Beauvoir\u2019s lifetime.\n\nIn her girlhood, Beauvoir was independent, curious, and a gifted\nstudent. She was often defiant of the rules of the adult world and\ndesired to fill her life with as many experiences as possible.\nAlthough initially devout in her faith, at age fourteen Beauvoir\nrejected the existence of God, which was a pivotal moment in her life,\nas was her family\u2019s loss of class status in 1919. The former\nevent propelled Beauvoir into studying philosophy, while the latter\nmade the bourgeois expectation of marriage improbable. Her early\ndevotion to an intellectual life proved to have social and material\nbenefits, offering her a way to concretely realize her independence\nduring an era when most women were economically dependent on men.\n\nIn 1925, at the age of seventeen, Beauvoir passed the\nbaccalaur\u00e9at exams in mathematics and philosophy. In 1926, she\nearned Certificates of Higher Studies in French literature and Latin\nafter studying at the Institut Catholique and the Institut\nSainte-Marie. In the fall of 1926 she began studying philosophy at the\nSorbonne where, in 1928\u20131929, she would write her graduate\nthesis (dipl\u00f4me) on Leibniz prior to taking the competitive\nagr\u00e9gation exam in philosophy in 1929. At twenty-one Beauvoir\nwas the youngest candidate to pass the exam, finishing second to\nJean-Paul Sartre who had taken the exam for the second time. As the\neighth woman to pass the agr\u00e9gation, Beauvoir\u2019s success\nsolidified her economic independence and she continued to assume her\nindependence in the face of patriarchal constraints. In the second\nvolume of her autobiography, The Prime of Life (1960),\nBeauvoir recounts this time as carefree, as if she were untethered to\nthe constraints of the world. Years later, different conditions would\nshift her attitude.\n\nWhile studying for the agr\u00e9gation, Beauvoir met Sartre and they\nfound in each other intellectual companions and lovers. Although\nBeauvoir has often been framed as merely adopting Sartre\u2019s\nphilosophical commitments, her diaries and memoirs tell another story.\nThey both relied on one another as interlocutors and Sartre often\nrelied on Beauvoir\u2019s intellectual acuity to develop his ideas.\nThough they refused the tradition of monogamy, the two remained\ntogether their entire lives. In 1929, they made a famous pact to be\n\u201cessential lovers\u201d, yet allowed for \u201ccontingent\nloves\u201d that they disclosed to one another. During her lifetime\nBeauvoir had numerous affairs with men and women, but none paralleled\nher relationship with American author Nelson Algren, whom she fell\ndeeply in love with. In various personal writings, Algren seems to\noccupy the place of an \u201cessential love\u201d far more than\nSartre. However, the pact with Sartre was never broken and the two\nwere bonded throughout their lifetime. This open relationship was\nradical for the time, yet Sartre and Beauvoir have also been\ncriticized for their sexual ethics. Given what is exposed in\nBeauvoir\u2019s diaries about her disappointments with her\nrelationship with Sartre, it is not entirely clear why she honored\ntheir pact. If anything, Beauvoir\u2019s life and work are reminders\nof the concrete contradictions and ambiguities we all, and women\nespecially, face, even in love.\n\nIn the 1930s, Beauvoir spent much of her time teaching philosophy\nuntil she was dismissed from her post in 1941 by the Nazis who had\noccupied Paris in 1940. The Nazi Occupation and the changing social\nand political climate had a profound impact on Beauvoir, and she\nbecame more attuned to ethics and the constitutive relationship\nbetween circumstance and freedom. During this time, she abandoned the\nrationalist-voluntarist position of her youth, and became more\npreoccupied with morality and agency in the concreteness of social\ncontext. From 1941\u20131946 she wrote several important works,\nincluding the novel, The Blood of Others (1945), her first\nphilosophical essay Pyrrhus et Cin\u00e9as (1944), a\nprecursor of sorts to The Ethics of Ambiguity (1947), and the\nnovel All Men are Mortal (1946). In 1945, she helped found\nthe leftist journal Les Temps Modernes with other French\nintellectuals, including Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. Beauvoir was a\nco-editor of the journal and it quickly became an important venue for\nphilosophical and political essays of the time, including\nBeauvoir\u2019s \u201cEye for an Eye\u201d (1946). While focusing\non her political writings, Beauvoir traveled to the United States and\nwrote America Day by Day (1948). It was also in Les Temps\nModernes that Beauvoir first published extracts of The Second\nSex (1949).\n\nAlthough Beauvoir was not an ardent feminist in her early years,\nThe Second Sex (1949) became one of the most important\nfeminist texts of the twentieth century, and it launched Beauvoir into\nthe public spotlight for generations to come. As The Second\nSex became a catalyst for challenging women\u2019s situations,\nBeauvoir\u2019s political and intellectual place was also reset.\nAfter repeatedly refusing to align herself with the feminist movement,\nBeauvoir declared herself a feminist in a 1972 interview in Le\nNouvel Observateur and joined other Marxist feminists in founding\nthe journal Questions F\u00e9ministes. In 1971, she\nauthored and signed Manifesto 343, a public declaration of 343 women\nwho admitted to having an abortion at a time when it was still illegal\nin France. In the 1960s, she also used her philosophical voice to\nengage in political activism against French colonialism, writing\npublicly against the torture of Djamila Boupacha and criticizing the\nindifference to the commonplace torture of Algerian women by the\nFrench Army.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s literary and philosophical success and reflections on\nthe concrete world continued after The Second Sex. She\npublished important essays, including \u201cMust We Burn Sade?\u201d\n(1951\u20131952) and \u201cRight Wing Thought Today\u201d (1955),\nthat further develop her notions of authenticity, responsibility, and\nsolidarity. Her novel The Mandarins (1954), a story about\nleft-wing intellectuals at the end of World War II, won the Prix\nGoncourt, the prestigious French literary award. As with many of her\nother works, this novel examines relationships, events, and struggles\nthat fictionalize aspects of her own life. As Beauvoir describes in\nthe third volume of her autobiography, Force of Circumstance\n(1963), The Mandarins is not a novel with a message, but\nrather a philosophical investigation of the meaning of life after the\nwar and the lived confrontation with being and nothingness. It is a\nwork that exemplifies Beauvoir\u2019s turn to literature to do\nphilosophy. A few years later in 1957, she published A Long\nMarch, an essay about her six-week visit to Communist China in\n1955 as one of the 1,500 delegates to visit for the Bandung\nConference. From 1958\u20131963, she published her autobiography in\nthree volumes (the fourth volume would come out in 1974), and not too\nlong after A Very Easy Death (1964), an intimate reflection\non the last six weeks of her mother\u2019s life, and later The\nWoman Destroyed (1967). After a significant period of\ninterdisciplinary research, similar to the work undertaken to write\nThe Second Sex, Beauvoir wrote The Coming of Age\n(1970), offering a harrowing account of what it means to become old\nand the oppression it entails in western, capitalist societies.\n\nAfter spending the latter half of her life as a feminist icon, public\nintellectual, and an eminent writer, Beauvoir died at seventy-eight,\non April 14, 1986. She was buried, with Sartre, in the Montparnasse\nCemetery in Paris, wearing the ring Nelson Algren had given her many\nyears earlier.\n\nIn spite of working amidst some of the most prominent French\nphilosophers of her time, Beauvoir\u2019s legacy has often been\ndenied its philosophical significance. Indeed, the details of her life\nhave often been taken to be more interesting than her ideas. This\nreception exemplifies that circumstances can often steal an\nindividual\u2019s transcendence, a point she pursues time and time\nagain in her work.\n2. Beauvoir the Philosopher\n\nBeauvoir was not considered a philosopher at the time of her death.\nSome have found Beauvoir\u2019s exclusion from the domain of\nphilosophy more than a matter of taking Beauvoir at her word. They\nattribute it to an exclusively systematic view of philosophy which,\napathetic to the philosophical methodology of the metaphysical novel,\nignored the ways that Beauvoir embedded existential-phenomenological\narguments in her literary works. Between those who did not challenge\nBeauvoir\u2019s self-portrait, those who did not accept her\nunderstanding of the relationship between literature and philosophy,\nand those who missed the unique signature of her philosophical essays,\nBeauvoir the philosopher remained a lady-in-waiting.\n\nSome have argued that the belated admission of Beauvoir into the ranks\nof philosophers is a matter of sexism on two counts. The first\nconcerns the fact that Beauvoir was a woman. Her philosophical\nwritings were read as echoes of Sartre rather than explored as\noriginal contributions because it was only \u201cnatural\u201d to\nthink of a woman as a disciple of her male companion. The second\nconcerns the fact that she wrote about women. The Second Sex,\nrecognized as one of the hundred most important works of the twentieth\ncentury, would not be counted as philosophy because it dealt with the\noppression of women, hardly a burning philosophical issue (so it was\nsaid). But, decades of scholarship on Beauvoir by feminist scholars\nhas proven that she deserves recognition as a philosopher in her own\nright.\n\nSuch recognition was not without its challenges, especially the one\nposed by Beauvoir. Her philosophical voice, she insisted, was merely\nan elaboration of Sartre\u2019s. Those denials coupled with the fact\nof her life-long relationship with him positioned her in the public\nand philosophical eye as Sartre\u2019s alter ego. Decoupling Beauvoir\nfrom Sartre became the first priority of those interested in\nestablishing her independent philosophical credentials. Sometimes the\nissue concerned Sartre\u2019s originality: Were the ideas of his\nBeing and Nothingness (1943) stolen from Beauvoir\u2019s\nShe Came to Stay (1943)? Sometimes they concerned matters of\ninfluence: What happened in their discussions and critiques of each\nother\u2019s work? Eventually these arguments abated and scholars\nturned from exclusive attention to the matter of Sartre\u2019s\ninfluence to the more fruitful question of influence in the broader\nsense. They began to trace the ways that she, like her\nexistential-phenomenological contemporaries, took up and reconfigured\ntheir philosophical heritage, identifying her philosophical\noriginality and unique contributions to existentialism and\nphenomenology. Studying her diaries and memoirs expose her\nphilosophical influences even more explicitly: Descartes and Kant were\nfamiliar figures in her philosophical vocabulary; her reading of Hegel\nwas influenced by the interpretations of Koj\u00e8ve; she was\nintroduced to Husserl and Heidegger by her teacher Baruzi; she drew on\nBergson before she had studied Hegel or Marx; if she had rewritten\nVolume I of The Second Sex, she would develop a more Marxist,\nless Hegelian account of the Other; and after meeting Jean Walh at a\ndinner party in 1939, Beauvoir became immersed in a study of\nKierkegaard which moved her away from Hegelianism and toward an\nexistentialist ethics of freedom.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s tenuous recognition as a philosopher also has much to\ndo with her critique of and challenge to its methods. She detailed her\nphenomenological and existential critique of the philosophical status\nquo in her 1946 essay \u201cLiterature and the Metaphysical\nEssay\u201d, and her 1965 and 1966 essays \u201cQue Peut la\nLitt\u00e9rature?\u201d and \u201cMon Exp\u00e9rience\nd\u2019\u00e9crivain\u201d. This critique, influenced by both\nHusserl and Heidegger, focused on the significance of lived experience\nand on the ways that literature unveils situated truths in the world.\nBeauvoir, Albert Camus and Sartre turned to the language of the novel\nand the theater. They looked to Husserl to theorize their turn to\nthese discourses by insisting on grounding their theoretical analyses\nin the concrete particulars of lived experience. They looked to\nHeidegger to challenge the privileged position of abstract discourses.\nFor Beauvoir, however, the turn to literature carried ethical and\npolitical as well as philosophical implications. Literature is a way\nto overcome existential separation between self and other, to engage\nand be undone by other truths. It allowed her to explore the limits of\nthe appeal (the activity of calling on others to take up one\u2019s\npolitical projects); to portray the temptations of violence; to enact\nher existential ethics of freedom, responsibility, joy and generosity;\nand to examine the intimacies and complexities of relationships with\nothers. She found in literature a way to reveal the contingency of the\nworld, along with its multiple, interwoven meanings, in ways that\ntraditional philosophical forms could not. Further, many of her works\nare shaped by rigorous interdisciplinary research, which allowed\nBeauvoir to think in the concrete, rather than in the abstract mode of\ntraditional philosophy.\n\nIn writing The Second Sex, Beauvoir undertook a challenge to\nthe patriarchal status quo. This challenge was a dramatic event that\ninspired controversy and social upheaval. At its publication, the book\nwas regarded more as an affront to sexual decency than a political\nindictment of patriarchy or a phenomenological investigation of\n\u201cwoman\u201d. It was the women who came to be known as\nsecond-wave feminists who understood what Beauvoir\u2019s first\nreaders missed. It was not sexual decency that was being attacked but\npatriarchal indecency that was on trial. The Second Sex\nexpressed their sense of injustice, focused their demands for social,\npolitical, and personal change and alerted them to the connections\nbetween private practices and public policies. No longer considered\nsexually scandalous, its analysis of patriarchy and women\u2019s\noppression, and its proposed antidotes to women\u2019s domination are\nstill debated.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s work has suffered in translation further obscuring\nher status as a philosopher and her political ideas in particular. The\nfirst English translation of The Second Sex, done by H.M.\nParshley, a zoologist with no background in philosophy, is perhaps\nmost well known for its controversial translation, which omits around\nfifteen percent of the original text, inaccurately translating the\ncentral philosophical concepts, and depoliticizing Beauvoir\u2019s\nfeminism. In 1953, when America Day by Day was published for\nan American audience, it also suffered from serious omissions, many of\nwhich focused on her account of race relations in the U.S. The English\ntranslations of several of Beauvoir\u2019s novels are also subtly\nemptied of her political commentary.\n\nNonetheless, Beauvoir\u2019s oeuvre challenged the borders separating\nphilosophy and literature and disrupted the boundaries between the\npersonal, the political, and the philosophical. Since her death, her\nstatus as an original philosopher has been secured, in large part due\nto feminist scholars who resisted the patriarchal constraints of the\ndiscipline of philosophy and reconsidered Beauvoir\u2019s own framing\nof her life and work. She would have appreciated the fact that her\ncurrent philosophical status reflects our changed understanding of the\ndomain of philosophy and the changed situation of women, for it\nconfirms her idea of situated freedom\u2014that our capacity for\nagency and whether or not we are identified as agents, is constrained,\nthough never determined, by our situation. She would also have\nappreciated the fact that while her works were instrumental in\neffecting these changes, their lasting effect is a tribute to the ways\nthat others have taken up her philosophical and feminist legacies; for\none of her crucial contributions to our ethical and political\nvocabularies is the concept of the appeal\u2014that the success of\nour projects depends on the extent to which they are adopted by\nothers.\n3. She Came to Stay: Freedom and Violence\n\nThough Beauvoir\u2019s first philosophical essay was Pyrrhus and\nCin\u00e9as (1944) many of her interpreters identify She\nCame to Stay (1943) as her inaugural philosophical foray. It is a\nclear example of what Beauvoir calls the metaphysical novel. The\nletters between Sartre and Beauvoir and Beauvoir\u2019s diaries of\nthat period (published in the 1980s), show that both Beauvoir and\nSartre were concerned with the question of the other, the issue of bad\nfaith and the dynamics of desire. They were also examining the\nrelationship and tensions between our singular existential status and\nthe social conditions within which our singularity is lived. She\nCame to Stay is packed with philosophical\nreflections\u2014reflections on our relationship to time, to each\nother, to ourselves. These reflections are never, however, presented\nin systematic arguments or brought to closure. They are lived in the\nconcrete, ambiguously triangulated lives of Pierre, Xavi\u00e8re and\nFran\u00e7oise. Opening with a quote from Hegel, \u201cEach\nconscience seeks the death of the other\u201d, and ending with\nFran\u00e7oise\u2019s murder of Xavi\u00e8re, which Beauvoir\nnarrates as an act in which Fran\u00e7oise confronts her solitude\nand announces her freedom, the novel does not necessarily confirm\nHegel\u2019s claim. The point of the murder was not to eliminate the\nother per se but to destroy a particular other, Xavi\u00e8re, who\nwas the other who threatened to leave Fran\u00e7oise without the\nother she loved, Pierre. Here, existential ambiguity trumps Hegelian\nclarity. The issues raised in this first novel, including the\nambiguity regarding the responsibilities and limits of freedom, the\nlegitimacy of violence, the tension between our experience of\nourselves as simultaneously solitary and intertwined with others, the\ntemptations of bad faith and the examination of the existentially\nfaithful relationship to time, will pervade Beauvoir\u2019s\nsubsequent reflections.\n4. Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as: Radical Freedom and the Other\n\nPyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as (1944), published one year after\nShe Came To Stay, is Beauvoir\u2019s first philosophical\nessay. It addresses fundamental ethical and political issues, such as:\nWhat are the criteria of ethical action? How can I distinguish ethical\nfrom unethical political projects? What are the principles of ethical\nrelationships? Can violence ever be justified? It examines these\nquestions from an existential-phenomenological perspective. Taking the\nsituation of the concrete existing individual as its point of\ndeparture, Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as provides an analysis of\nthe ways that, as particular subjects, we are necessarily embedded in\nthe world and inescapably related to others. Though not feminist in\nany identifiable sense, this essay raises such compelling feminist\nquestions as: Under what conditions, if any, may I speak for/in the\nname of another?\n\nAfter opening Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as with Plutarch\u2019s\naccount of a conversation between Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as, where the\njustification of action is questioned, Beauvoir, finding the\nrecommendation to be passively inconsistent with the realities of\nhuman nature and desire, asks three questions: What is the measure of\na person? What goals can one set for oneself? What hopes are permitted\nto us? She then divides the text into two parts. Part one moves from\nthe ontological truth\u2014that I am a finite freedom whose endings\nare always and necessarily new beginnings\u2014to the existential\nquestions: How can I desire to be what I am? How can I live my\nfinitude with passion? These existential questions lead to moral and\npolitical ones: What actions express the truth and passion of our\ncondition? How can I act in such a way so as to create the conditions\nthat sustain and support the humanity of human beings? Part I\nconcludes with the observation that: \u201cA man alone in the world\nwould be paralyzed by \u2026 the vanity of all of his goals. But man\nis not alone in the world\u201d (PhilW 115, cf. P&C 42). Beauvoir\nopens Part II with the properly ethical question: What is my relation\nto the other? Here the analysis is dominated by the problem created by\nBeauvoir\u2019s insistence on the radical nature of freedom.\nAccording to Beauvoir, the other, as free, is immune to my power.\nWhatever I do\u2014if as a master I exploit slaves, or as an\nexecutioner I hang murderers\u2014I cannot violate their inner\nsubjective freedom. Making a distinction between freedom as internal\nand the external conditions through which self and other engage,\nBeauvoir argues that we can never directly touch the freedom of\nothers. This inner-outer distinction underscores that our\nrelationships are either superficial, engaging only the outer surface\nof each other\u2019s being, or they are mediated through our common\ncommitment to a shared goal or value.\n\nThis line of argument would seem to lead either to benign Stoic\nconclusions of mutual indifference or to the finding that tyrants and\nterrorists pose no threat to individual freedom. Beauvoir does not,\nhowever, let it drift in these directions. Instead she uses the\ninner-outer distinction and the idea that I need others to take up my\nprojects if they are to have a future, to introduce the ideas of the\nappeal and risk. She develops the concept of freedom as transcendence\n(the movement toward an open future and indeterminate possibilities)\nto argue that we cannot be determined by the present. The essence of\nfreedom as transcendence aligns freedom with uncertainty and risk. To\nbe free is to be radically contingent. Though I find myself in a world\nof value and meaning, these values and meanings were brought into the\nworld by others. I am free to reject, alter or endorse them for the\nmeaning of the world is shaped by human choices. Whatever choice I\nmake, however, I cannot support it without the help of others. My\nvalues will find a home in the world only if others embrace them; only\nif I persuade others to make my values theirs.\n\nSo, as radically free I need the other. I need to be able to appeal to\nothers to join me in my projects. The knot of the ethical problem lies\nhere: How can I, a radically free being who is existentially severed\nfrom all other human freedoms, transcend the isolations of freedom to\ncreate a community of allies? Given the necessity of appealing to the\nother\u2019s freedom, under what conditions is such an appeal\npossible?\n\nIn answering these questions Beauvoir turns the inner-outer\ndistinction to her advantage as she develops the concept of situated\nfreedom. Though I can neither act for another nor directly influence\ntheir freedom, I must, Beauvoir argues, accept responsibility for the\nfact that my actions produce the conditions within which the other\nacts. \u201cI am\u201d, Beauvoir writes, \u201cthe face of the\nother\u2019s misery... I am the facticity of their situation\u201d\n(PhilW 126, cf. P&C 58). Pursuing this difference between my power\nto effect the other\u2019s freedom and my responsibility for their\nsituation, and exploring the conditions under which my appeal to the\nother can/will be heard, Beauvoir determines that there are two\nconditions of the appeal. First, I must be allowed to call to the\nother and I must struggle against those who try to silence me. Second,\nthere must be others who can respond to my call. The first condition\nmay be purely political. The second is political and material because,\nas Beauvoir argues, it is only as peers that others are capable of\nresponding to my call. Only those who are not consumed by the struggle\nfor survival, only those who exist in the material conditions of\nfreedom, health, leisure and security can become my allies in the\nstruggle against injustice. Thus, it is only as equals that the second\ncondition can be met. To achieve such equality, we have to strive to\npursue justice, as only then will the material and political\nconditions of the appeal be secured.\n\nViolence is not ruled out. Given that Beauvoir has argued that we can\nnever reach the other in the depths of their freedom, she cannot call\nviolence evil. She does not, however, endorse violence. Neither does\nshe envision a future without conflict. The fact that we are\ndifferently situated and engage in the work of transcendence from\ndifferent social, historical, and economic positions ensures that some\nof us will always be an obstacle to another\u2019s freedom. \u201cWe\nare\u201d, Beauvoir writes, \u201ccondemned to violence\u201d\n(PhilW 138, cf. P&C 77). As neither evil nor avoidable, violence,\nshe argues, is \u201cthe mark of a failure which nothing can\noffset\u201d (PhilW 138, cf. P&C 77). It is the tragedy of the\nhuman condition.\n\nThe argument of Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as ends on an uneasy\nnote. As ethical, we are obliged to work for the conditions of\nmaterial and political equality. In calling on others to take up our\nprojects and give these projects a future, we are precluded from\nforcing others to become our allies. We are enjoined to appeal to\ntheir freedom. Where persuasion fails, however, we are permitted the\nrecourse to violence. The ambiguity of our being as subjects for\nourselves and objects for others in the world is lived in this dilemma\nof violence and justice. Becoming lucid about the meaning of freedom,\nwe learn to live our freedom by accepting its finitude and\ncontingency, its risks and its failures.\n5. The Ethics of Ambiguity: Bad Faith, the Appeal, the Artist\n\nIt is impossible to know where Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s thinking\nwould have gone had she been spared the cold, the hunger and the fear\nof living in Nazi occupied Paris. What we do know is that in coming\nface to face with forces of injustice beyond her control, the\nquestions of evil and the other took on new urgency. Beauvoir speaks\nof the war as creating an existential rupture in time. She speaks of\nherself as having undergone a conversion. She can no longer afford the\nluxury of focusing on her own happiness and pleasure. The question of\nevil becomes a pressing concern. One cannot refuse to take a stand.\nOne is either a collaborator or not. In writing The Ethics of\nAmbiguity, Beauvoir takes her stand. She identifies herself as an\nexistentialist and identifies existentialism as the philosophy of our\n(her) times because it is the only philosophy that takes the question\nof evil seriously. It is the only philosophy prepared to counter\nDostoevsky\u2019s claim that without God everything is permissible.\nThat we are alone in the world and that we exist without guarantees,\nare not, however, the only truths of the human condition. There is\nalso the truth of our freedom and this truth, as detailed in The\nEthics of Ambiguity, entails a logic of reciprocity and\nresponsibility that contests the terrors of a world ruled only by the\nauthority of power.\n\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity, published in 1947, reconsiders the\nidea of invulnerable freedom advanced in Pyrrhus and\nCin\u00e9as. Dropping the distinction between the inner and\nouter domains of freedom and deploying a unique understanding of\nconsciousness as an intentional activity, Beauvoir now argues that I\ncan be alienated from my freedom. Similar to She Came To\nStay, which bears the imprint of Hegel\u2019s account of the\nfight to the death that sets the stage for the master-slave dialectic,\nand Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as, which works through the\nCartesian implications of our existential situation, The Ethics of\nAmbiguity redeploys concepts of canonical philosophical figures.\nHere Beauvoir takes up the phenomenologies of Husserl and Hegel to\nprovide an analysis of intersubjectivity that accepts the singularity\nof the existing individual without allowing that singularity to\njustify an epistemological solipsism, an existential isolationism or\nan ethical egoism. The Hegel drawn on here is the Hegel who resolves\nthe inequalities of the master-slave relationship through the justice\nof mutual recognition. The Husserl appealed to is the Husserl who\nintroduced Beauvoir to the thesis of intentionality.\n\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity opens with an account of\nintentionality which designates the meaning-disclosing and\nmeaning-desiring activities of consciousness as both insistent and\nambiguous\u2014insistent in that they are spontaneous and\nunstoppable; ambiguous in that they preclude any possibility of\nself-unification or closure. Beauvoir describes the intentionality of\nconsciousness as operating in two ways. First, there is the activity\nof wanting to disclose the meaning of being. Second, there is the\nactivity of bringing meaning to the world. In the first mode of\nactivity consciousness expresses its freedom to discover meaning. In\nthe second, it uses its freedom to articulate meaning and give meaning\nto the world. Beauvoir identifies each of these intentionalities with\na mood: the first with the mood of joy, the second with the dual moods\nof hope and domination. Whether the second moment of intentionality\nbecomes the ground of projects of liberation or exploitation depends\non whether the mood of hope or domination prevails.\n\nDescribing consciousness as ambiguous, Beauvoir identifies our\nambiguity with the idea of failure. We can never fulfill our passion\nfor meaning in either of its intentional expressions; that is, we will\nnever succeed in fully revealing the meaning of the world, and never\nbecome God, the author of the meaning of the world. These truths of\nintentionality set the criteria of Beauvoir\u2019s ethics. Finding\nthat ethical systems and absolutes, insofar as they claim to give\nfinal answers to our ethical dilemmas and authoritarian justifications\nfor our actions, offer dangerous consolations for our failure to be\nthe absolute source of the world\u2019s meaning or being, Beauvoir\nrejects these systems of absolutes in favor of ethical projects that\nacknowledge our limits and recognize the future as open. From this\nperspective, her ethics of ambiguity might be characterized as an\nethics of existential hope.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s The Ethics of Ambiguity is a secularism that\nrejects the ideas of God and Humanity. Their apparent differences\nconceal a common core: both claim to have identified an absolute\nsource and justification for our beliefs and actions. They allow us to\nevade responsibility for creating the conditions of our existence and\nto flee the anxieties of ambiguity. Whether it is called the age of\nthe Messiah or the classless society, these appeals to a utopian\ndestiny encourage us to think in terms of ends which justify means.\nThey invite us to sacrifice the present for the future. They are the\nstuff of inquisitions, imperialisms, gulags and Auschwitz. Privileging\nthe future over the present they pervert our relationship to time,\neach other and ourselves. Insisting that the future is undecided and\nthat its form will be shaped by our present decisions, Beauvoir argues\nthat it is only by insisting on the dignity of today\u2019s human\nbeings that the dignity of those to come can be secured.\n\nBeauvoir rejects the familiar charge against secularism made famous by\nDostoevsky\u2019s Grand Inquisitor: \u201cIf God is dead everything\nis permitted\u201d. As she sees it, without God to pardon us for our\n\u201csins\u201d we are totally and inexcusably responsible for our\nactions. Dostoevsky was mistaken. The problem of secularism is not\nthat of license, it is the problem of the \u201cwe\u201d. Can\nseparate individuals be bound to each other? Can they forge laws\nbinding for all? The Ethics of Ambiguity insists that they\ncan. It does this by arguing that evil resides in the denial of\nfreedom (mine and others), that we are responsible for ensuring the\nexistence of the conditions of freedom (the material conditions of a\nminimal standard of living and the political conditions of uncensored\ndiscourse and association), and that I can neither affirm nor live my\nfreedom without also affirming the freedom of others.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s argument for ethical freedom begins by noting a\nfundamental fact of the human condition. We begin our lives as\nchildren who are dependent on others and embedded in a world already\nendowed with meaning. We are born into the condition that Beauvoir\ncalls the \u201cserious world\u201d. This is a world of ready made\nvalues and established authorities. This is a world where obedience is\ndemanded. For children, this world is not alienating for they are too\nyoung to assume the responsibilities of freedom. As children who\ncreate imaginary worlds, we are in effect learning the lessons of\nfreedom\u2014that we are creators of the meaning and value of the\nworld. Free to play, children develop their creative capacities and\ntheir ability to confer meaning to the world without, however, being\nheld accountable for the worlds they bring into being. Considering\nthese two dimensions of children\u2019s lives, their imaginative\nfreedom and their freedom from responsibility, Beauvoir determines\nthat the child lives a metaphysically privileged existence. Children,\nshe says, experience the joys but not the anxieties of freedom.\nBeauvoir also, however, describes children as mystified. By this she\nmeans that they believe that the foundations of the world are secure\nand that their place in the world is naturally given and unchangeable.\nBeauvoir marks adolescence as the end of this idyllic era. It is the\ntime of moral decision. Emerging into the world of adults, we are now\ncalled upon to renounce the serious world, to reject the mystification\nof childhood, and to take responsibility for our choices.\n\nAll of us pass through the age of adolescence; not all of us take up\nits ethical demands. The fact of our initial dependency and obedience\nto the serious world has moral implications because it predisposes us\nto the temptations of bad faith, strategies by which we deny our\nexistential freedom and our moral responsibility. It sets our desire\nin the direction of a nostalgia for those lost Halcyon days. Looking\nto return to the security of that metaphysically privileged time, some\nof us evade the responsibilities of freedom by choosing to remain\nchildren, that is, we submit to the authority of others and live in\nthe serious world.\n\nBeauvoir does not object to the mystification of childhood. She\nacknowledges that parental authority is necessary for the\nchild\u2019s survival, and she insists that this shelter of safety\nshould cultivate a child\u2019s freedom. To choose to remain a child\nis an act of bad faith. To treat adults as children, however, is\nimmoral and evil. If we are exploited, enslaved or terrorized,\nhowever, our submission to authority of the other cannot be counted as\nan act of bad faith. Absent these conditions, Beauvoir holds us\naccountable for our response to the experience of freedom. We cannot\nuse the anxieties of freedom either as an excuse for our active\nparticipation in or for our passive acceptance of the exploitation of\nothers. Hiding behind the authority of others or establishing\nourselves as authorities over others are culpable offenses.\n\nBeauvoir portrays the complexity of the ways that we either avoid or\naccept the responsibilities of freedom through the figures of the\nsub-man, the serious man, the nihilist, the adventurer, the passionate\nman, the critical thinker and the artist-writer. These figures are\nimaginary, but also historical in the sense that they are lived, and\nso, disclosed in the actions of human beings. The point of delineating\nthese human types is several fold. It is a way of distinguishing\nbetween two kinds of unethical positions. One position, portrayed in\nthe portraits of the sub-man and the serious man, is to refuse to\nrecognize the experience of freedom. The other position, depicted in\nthe pictures of the nihilist, the adventurer and the maniacally\npassionate man, is to misread the meanings of freedom. The ethical\nperson, as portrayed by Beauvoir, is driven by passion. Unlike the\negoistic, maniacal passion of the tyrant, however, the ethical passion\nof the artist-writer is defined by its generosity\u2014specifically\nthe generosity of recognizing the other\u2019s singularity and\nprotecting the other in their difference from becoming an object of\nanother\u2019s will.\n\nIn describing the different ways that freedom is evaded or misused,\nBeauvoir distinguishes ontological from ethical freedom. She shows us\nthat acknowledging our freedom is a necessary but not sufficient\ncondition for ethical action. To meet the conditions of the ethical,\nfreedom must be used properly. It must, according to Beauvoir, embrace\nthe ties that bind me to others and take up the appeal\u2014an act\nwhereby I call on others, in their freedom, to join me in bringing\ncertain values, projects, and conditions into being. Artists and\nwriters embody the ethical ideal in several respects. Their work\nexpresses the subjective passion that grounds the ethical life. They\ndescribe the ways that the material and political complexities of our\nsituations can either alienate us from our freedom or open us to it.\nBy envisioning the future as open and contingent, artists and writers\nchallenge the mystifications that validate sacrificing the present for\nthe future. They establish the essential relationship between my\nfreedom and the freedom of others.\n\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity does not avoid the question of\nviolence. Determining that violence is sometimes necessary, Beauvoir\nuses the example of a young Nazi soldier to argue that to liberate the\noppressed we may have to destroy their oppressors. However, she\ndistances herself from the argument of Pyrrhus and\nCin\u00e9as; now she identifies violence as an assault on the\nother\u2019s freedom (however misused) and as such this violence\nmarks our failure to respect the \u201cwe\u201d of our humanity.\nThus, The Ethics of Ambiguity provides an analysis of our\nexistential-ethical situation that joins a hard-headed realism\n(violence is an unavoidable fact of our condition) with demanding\nrequirements. It is unique, however, in aligning this realism and\nthese requirements with the passion of generosity and a mood of\njoy.\n6. America Day by Day: A Concrete Encounter\n\nIn January of 1947, Beauvoir traveled to America, landing at LaGuardia\nAirport in New York. The purpose of her trip, which was sponsored by\nthe French government, was to give lectures at colleges and\nuniversities on \u201cthe ethical problems of the post-war\nwriter\u201d. In the four months of her visit, she delivered twelve\nlectures, including those at Vassar, Oberlin, Mills College, and\nHarvard. Yet, her trip was also much more than a lecture tour.\nTraveling all over the country by car, train, and bus, Beauvoir\nvisited nineteen states and over fifty cities, furthered her\nfriendship with Richard Wright, fell in love with Nelson Algren, and\ndeveloped various political critiques of the United States. She\ndetails her visit in America Day by Day, a genre bending\ntravel-diary-essay, published in French in 1948. Although often cast\nas just a travel writing, it should not be overlooked as a political\nor philosophical text. Indeed, central to Beauvoir\u2019s concerns in\nAmerica Day by Day is how one\u2019s concrete situation is\nconstitutive of recognition and freedom. \n\nSimilar to her autobiographical writings, America Day by Day\nis a narrated record of Beauvoir\u2019s daily, concrete experiences.\nRather than advancing an argument, Beauvoir sets out to describe what\nshe did and what she perceived, while also at times offering critical\nviews of the social and political attitudes she encountered. For these\nreasons, this book is both a break from the general, abstract writing\nof her previous philosophical works, and generative of her more\nconcrete, politicized writings, thereby acting as a precursor to her\nconcrete analysis of women\u2019s situation (which she had already\nbegun prior to her visit to America), her account of China, and her\npersonal writings. It is only by being in the everydayness of America,\nbeing in its concrete proximity, that Beauvoir is able, perhaps\nwilling even, to offer an account of its problems.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s account of America elucidates the dominant attitudes\nof bad faith in America. She writes about her observations of the\nexpressions of political apathy, anti-intellectualism, moral optimism,\nsocial conformism, and a capitalist-driven passivity among many\nAmericans, especially among the white, elite. She describes her\nconfrontations with segregation in the South, the violence of\nwhiteness in the North, and she notices the racism of white women and\nthe contradictions between America\u2019s commitment to democracy and\nits racism. Further, she accounts for class politics and labor\nrelations, America\u2019s foreign policy, and she reflects on the\nkinds of mystifications of ethics and politics in America that lead\nAmericans into bad faith.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s attention to America\u2019s race relations and her\nconfrontation with her own whiteness during her visit have much to do\nwith Wright\u2019s influence on Beauvoir, whom she spent time with\nduring her long stay in New York, and her reading of Gunnar\nMyrdal\u2019s An American Dilemma (1944), which she often\nreferences. Yet, even as Beauvoir attends to race relations and white\npeople\u2019s racial hatred in America, scholars have pointed out\nthat there are also aspects of her account that expose\nBeauvoir\u2019s own white perception and colonizing encounters. This\ndimension of America Day by Day complicates but does not\nerase Beauvoir\u2019s political critique of America or the import of\nher description of the moral and political dispositions of Americans.\n\n7. The Second Sex: Woman As Other\n\nWhile writing America Day by Day, Beauvoir was beginning to\nwork out her ideas for what would become her most famous book, The\nSecond Sex. In her autobiography Force of Circumstance,\nBeauvoir looks back at The Ethics of Ambiguity and criticizes\nit for being too abstract. She does not repudiate the arguments of her\ntext, but finds that it erred in trying to define morality independent\nof a social context. The Second Sex may be read as correcting\nthis error, reworking and materially situating the analyses of The\nEthics of Ambiguity. Where The Ethics of Ambiguity\nconjured up images of ethical and unethical figures to make its\narguments tangible, the analyses of The Second Sex are\nmaterialized in Beauvoir\u2019s experiences as a woman and in\nwomen\u2019s lived realities. Where The Ethics of Ambiguity\nspeaks of mystification in a general sense, The Second Sex\nspeaks of the specific ways that the natural and social sciences and\nthe European literary, social, moral, political and religious\ntraditions have created a world where impossible and conflicting\nideals of femininity produce an ideology of women\u2019s\n\u201cnatural\u201d inferiority to justify patriarchal\ndomination.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s self-criticism suggests that her later works mark a\nbreak with her earlier writings. We should, however, resist the\ntemptation to take this notion of discontinuity too far. Rather than\nthinking in terms of breaks it is more fruitful to see The Second\nSex in terms of a more radical commitment to the phenomenological\ninsight that it is as embodied beings that we engage the world. Our\naccess to, awareness of, and possibilities for world engagement cannot\nbe considered absent a consideration of the body as it is lived in a\nconcrete situation.\n\nIt was in 1946, while at the Deux Magots cafe in Paris, that Beauvoir\nfirst came up with the idea for The Second Sex. Inspired by\nL\u2019\u00e2ge d\u2019homme (1939) written by Michel\nLeiris, Beauvoir comes up with the question: \u201cWhat has it meant\nto me to be a woman?\u201d Beauvoir\u2019s immediate reflection\ndisregarded the significance of being a woman, but she soon realized\nthe world around her had always been a masculine one. Beauvoir then\npursued the question through an interdisciplinary study of the myths\nof femininity, while taking herself, her situation as a woman, and the\nsituation and embodiment of being a woman more generally as the\nsubjects of her philosophical reflections. It is Beauvoir\u2019s\ninitial interest in the myths of femininity and their role in\nwomen\u2019s lives that led her to develop the claim central to the\nbook: woman is the Other, man is the essential being.\n\nThe Second Sex is a deliberate feminist phenomenological\ninvestigation of the sexed/gendered body, and it is considered a\nfounding text in the field of feminist phenomenology. Beauvoir draws\nexplicitly on narrative accounts of women\u2019s lived experience and\nfocuses on the entanglement of the general and the particular, rather\nthan bracketing the contingent to arrive at pure experience. In doing\nso, she exposes how masculinist ideology exploits sexual difference to\ncreate a system of oppression that positions and traps women in the\nrole of the Other. Such entrapment is part of history and mythology\n(which she explores in Volume I) and lived experience (described in\nVolume II). Central to Volume I is her discussion of the myth of the\neternal feminine, a master myth that works to ensnare women in an\nunattainable ideal in order to undermine their existence as\nindividuals. For Beauvoir, the myth of the eternal feminine is\nsocially powerful and generative of \u201cfeminine existence\u201d.\nIt is through the sociohistorical creation and legacy of this myth and\nthrough lived experience that women become anchored to the realm of\nimmanence and are forced to relinquish their claim to transcendence.\nIn doing so, women become split subjects, namely those who have the\ncapacity for world-making activity but are pushed into the repetitive,\npassive, closed realm of existence.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s liberatory response to women\u2019s oppression is a\nfeminism of freedom. The Second Sex argues against the\neither/or frame of the woman question (either women and men are equal\nor they are different). It argues for women\u2019s equality, while\ninsisting on the reality of sexual difference. Beauvoir finds it\nunjust and immoral to use sexual difference as an argument for\nwomen\u2019s subordination. She insists that women and men must both\nhave the capacity to assume their existence as immanence and\ntranscendence, and therefore must treat each other as equal. Yet, such\ntreatment requires that their sexual differences be validated. She\nfinds it un-phenomenological, however, to ignore it. As a\nphenomenologist she is obliged to examine women\u2019s unique\nexperiences of their bodies and to determine how these experiences are\nco-determined by what phenomenology calls the everyday attitude (the\ncommon-sense assumptions that we unreflectively bring to our\nexperience). For Beauvoir, since the body is a situation, it is not\nmerely that a subject has a body. Rather, the body is lived and so it\nis experientially constituted, such that for Beauvoir, what it means\nto become a woman is to live or experience one\u2019s body in a\nparticular way.\n\nAs a phenomenologist, this experiential account of embodiment does not\ncommit her to a biological account of \u2018woman\u2019. Beauvoir\nexplores cultural and historical assumptions that frame women\u2019s\nexperience of their bodies and that alienate them from their\npossibilities. She draws attention to the experiential basis of facts,\nincluding biological, psychological, historical, and economic ones,\nand considers how they obscure the contingent articulation of\n\u2018woman\u2019 or account for women\u2019s experience as an\nessence. For example, it is assumed that women are weaker. What, she\ndirects us to ask, is the ground of this assumption? What criteria of\nstrength are used? Upper body power? Average body size? Is there a\nreason not to consider longevity a sign of strength? Using this\ncriterion, would women still be considered the weaker sex? A bit of\nreflection exposes the biases of the criteria used to support the\nsupposedly obvious \u201cfact\u201d of women\u2019s weakness and\ntransforms it from an unassailable reality to an unreliable\nassumption. Once we begin this questioning, it is not long before\nother so-called facts fall to the side of \u201ccommon sense\u201d\nin the phenomenological sense.\n\nWhat is perhaps the most famous line of The Second Sex,\n\u201cOn ne na\u00eet pas femme: on le devient\u201d (SS:1949, 13),\ntranslated in 1953 as \u201cOne is not born but becomes a\nwoman\u201d (SS:1953, 267) and in 2010 as \u201cOne is not born but\nbecomes woman\u201d (SS: 2010, 283), is credited by many as alerting\nus to the sex-gender distinction. Whether or not Beauvoir understood\nherself to be inaugurating this distinction, whether or not she\nfollowed this distinction to its logical/radical conclusions, or\nwhether or not radical conclusions are justified are matters of\nfeminist debate. What is not a matter of dispute is that The\nSecond Sex gives us the vocabulary for analyzing how societal\nnotions of femininity are lived and a method for critiquing them. In\nthis sense, Beauvoir offers a critical phenomenological analysis of\nthe socially constituted meanings of \u2018woman\u2019 and how one\ncomes to assume and negotiate those meanings experientially. For\nBeauvoir, one becomes a woman not just because others say so, but\nbecause she actively assumes her bodily existence in such a way.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s account of becoming is crucial to understanding how\nhuman beings called women come into existence. Beauvoir\u2019s target\nhere is essentialist arguments that view \u2018woman\u2019 as a\nbiological fact. Beauvoir believes it to be faulty to accept the\ncommon sense idea that to be born with certain genitalia or\nreproductive capacities is to be born a woman. In rejecting this\nposition, asserted in the most famous line of The Second Sex,\nshe pursues the first rule of phenomenology: identify your\nassumptions, treat them as prejudices and put them aside; do not bring\nthem back into play until and unless they have been validated by\nexperience. Accordingly, she offers a descriptive account of how some\nhuman beings become women as a matter of living an imposed social\ndestiny rooted in and generated by particular historical, economic,\nand political conditions, as well as social and moral conventions. On\nthis view, \u2018woman\u2019 is an invention, but also a lived,\nembodied reality. For Beauvoir, the social destiny those who become\nwomen are expected and often coerced to assume is bound up with\nheterosexism such that to become a woman is to be made and to make\noneself an object for men. The detriment of such self-making, Beauvoir\nshows, is that a woman comes to live an existence relative to men. In\ndoing so, a woman becomes the Other. Women, however, are usually\naccomplice to this self-making, as being made the Other, although a\ncondition of oppression, also bestows recognition and\nself-justification in a patriarchal milieu.\n\nA brief but packed sentence that appears early in the The Second\nSex alerts us to the ways that Beauvoir used existential and\nMarxist categories to analyze the unique complexities of women\u2019s\nsituation as the Other. It reads,\n\n\nHence woman makes no claim for herself as subject because she lacks\nthe concrete means, because she senses the necessary link connecting\nher to man without positing its reciprocity, and because she often\nderives satisfaction from her role as the Other. (SS: 2010, 10, cf.\nSS: 1949, 24)\n\n\nWho becomes a woman in the way Beauvoir describes is an important\nquestion. Scholars have noted the impact of Richard Wright\u2019s\nintellectual influence on Beauvoir\u2019s account of women\u2019s\nsituation and oppression, and Beauvoir herself makes direct reference\nto Wright in The Second Sex, yet her treatment of race in the\nbook is vexed. Scholars have pointed out that her treatment of\nwomen\u2019s situation focuses explicitly on becoming a woman, thus\nprivileging an analysis of patriarchal oppression as the most\nsignificant form of oppression, and have noted that she generalizes\nfrom a white, bourgeois perspective. At the same time, as other\nscholars have noted, at the beginning of The Second Sex,\nBeauvoir argues that the patriarchal subjection of women is distinct\nin kind from racial subjection. While discrete historical events have\nbeen generative of other forms of oppression, she describes the\nsubjection of women as feature of human existence across time and\nplace and so not identifiable by a discrete historical event. So, for\nBeauvoir, it is not that women\u2019s subjection is the only form of\noppression or that it is more significant than other forms of\nsubjection. Rather, the formation, structure and effects of the\nsubjection of women is distinct and therefore, on her account,\nrequires a focused investigation. \n\nTo account for what it means to become a woman, Beauvoir introduces\nthe concept of the Other early in the text and it drives her entire\nanalysis. She uses it again in her last major work, The Coming of\nAge (1970), to structure her critique of the ways that the\nelderly are othered by society. In The Second Sex,\nBeauvoir\u2019s notion of the Other is based on the Hegelian\nmaster-slave dialectic. Unlike Hegel who universalized this dialectic,\nBeauvoir distinguishes the dialectic of exploitation between\nhistorically constituted Subjects and Others from the exploitation\nthat ensues when the Subject is Man, a sovereign existence, and the\nOther is Woman, a relative existence. In the first case, the Other\nexperiences their oppression as a communal reality. They see\nthemselves as part of an oppressed group. Here, oppressed Others may\ncall on the resources of a common history and a shared abusive\nsituation to assert their subjectivity and demand recognition and\nreciprocity. The situation of women is comparable to the condition of\nthe Hegelian Other in that men, like the Hegelian Master, identify\nthemselves as the Subject, the absolute human type, and, measuring\nwomen by this standard of the human, identify them as inferior.\nWomen\u2019s so-called inadequacies are then used as justification\nfor seeing them as the Other and for treating them accordingly. Unlike\nthe Hegelian Other, however, women are unable to identify the origin\nof their otherness. They cannot call on the bond of a shared history\nto reestablish their lost status as Subjects. Further, dispersed among\nthe world of men, women identify themselves in terms of the\ndifferences of their oppressors (e.g., as white or black women, as\nworking-class or middle-class women, as Muslim, Christian, Jewish,\nBuddhist or Hindu women) rather than with each other. According to\nBeauvoir, they lack the solidarity and resources of the Hegelian Other\nfor organizing themselves into a \u201cwe\u201d that demands\nrecognition. Unlike the Other of the master-slave dialectic, women are\nnot positioned to rebel. Beauvoir uses the category of the Inessential\nOther to designate the unique situation of women as the ambiguous\nOther of men. As Inessential Others, women\u2019s routes to\nsubjectivity and recognition cannot follow the Hegelian script.\n\nFor Beauvoir, women\u2019s conflict with men is ambiguous. She calls\nthe relation between men and women a \u201cprimordial\nMitsein\u201d (SS:2010, 9, cf. 1949, 22) in order to make a\nclaim about their original togetherness in the world. For Beauvoir,\nthis relationship between women and men draws attention to the\ninterdependence between the Subject and his Other and is the unique\ntie that binds women to their oppressors. As such, it is generative of\nwomen\u2019s inability to identify a common history. This assertion\nthat women live a necessary bond with men regardless of a lack of\nreciprocity draws on the notion of appeal developed in The Ethics\nof Ambiguity: in making an appeal to others to join me in my\npursuit of justice I validate myself and my values. Given that my\nappeal must be an appeal to the other in their freedom, I must allow\nfor the reality that the other may reject it. When this happens, I\nmust (assuming that the rejection is not a threat to the ground value\nof freedom) recognize the other\u2019s freedom and affirm the bond of\nhumanity that ties us to each other. In the case of women, Beauvoir\nnotes, this aspect of the appeal (the affirmation of the bond between\nus) dominates. She does not approve of the way that women allow the\naffirmation of the bond to eclipse the requirement that they be\nrecognized as free subjects. But, she does alert us to the fact that\nrecognition in itself is not the full story of the ethical\nrelationship. To demand recognition without regard for the bond is\nunethical; it is the position of the Subject as master. What is\nneeded, Beauvoir argues, is a reconstitution of the bond that enables\nwomen to accomplish themselves.\n\nSuch change does not concern women\u2019s happiness. Happiness may be\nchosen or accepted in exchange for the deprivations of freedom.\nRecalling the argument of The Ethics of Ambiguity we know\nwhy. As Others, women are returned to the metaphysically privileged\nworld of the child. They experience the happiness brought about by bad\nfaith\u2014a happiness of not being responsible for themselves, of\nnot having to make consequential choices. From this existential\nperspective women may be said to be complicit in their subjugation.\nBut this is not the whole story. If women are happy as the Other, it\nmay be because, given the material and ideological realities of their\nsituation, this is the only avenue of happiness open to them.\nBeauvoir\u2019s existential charge of bad faith must be understood\nwithin her Marxist analysis of the social, economic and cultural\nstructures that frame women\u2019s lives. Though Beauvoir does not\nargue that these structures deprive women of their freedom, neither\ndoes she ignore the situations that make the exercise of that freedom\nextremely difficult.\n\nFor Beauvoir, the work of liberation will not be easy. It is work that\nwill cause conflict because it requires refusing and ultimately\nsacrificing norms and customs of femininity and masculinity, the very\nones that are, for many, sources of happiness and self-justification.\nLiberation is also not a matter of appealing to men to give women\nfreedom; it is a matter of women discovering their solidarity,\nrejecting the bad faith temptations of happiness and discovering the\npleasures of freedom. While Beauvoir alerts us to the tensions and\nconflicts that this will create between men and women, she does not\nenvision a permanent state of hostility. Here her Hegelian-Marxist\noptimism prevails. Men will (ultimately) recognize women as free\nsubjects, but only when both commit to sacrificing patriarchal\nmyths.\n\nSpeaking in reference to sexual difference, Beauvoir notes that\ndismantling patriarchal mythology is not a recipe for androgynous\nsubjects. Given the realities of embodiment, there will be sexual\ndifferences. Unlike today, however, these differences will appear\ndifferently. They will not be used to justify the difference between a\nSubject and his Inessential Other. Ultimately, according to her, the\ngoal of liberation is our mutual recognition of each other as free and\nas other.\n\nDespite the heterosexist structure of the myth of the eternal\nfeminine, Beauvoir describes one situation in which mutual recognition\nsometimes exists: the intimate heterosexual erotic encounter. Speaking\nof this intimacy, she writes, \u201cthe dimension of the other\nremains; but the fact is that alterity no longer has a hostile\ncharacter\u201d (SS: 2010, 415, cf. 1949, 189). Why? Because\nauthentic lovers experience themselves and each other ambiguously,\nthat is, as both subjects and objects of erotic desire rather than as\ndelineated according to institutionalized positions of man and woman.\nIn Beauvoir\u2019s words,\n\n\nThe erotic experience is one that most poignantly reveals to human\nbeings their ambiguous condition; they experience it as flesh and as\nspirit, as the other and as subject (SS: 2010, 416, cf. SS: 1949,\n190).\n\n\nThe concept of ambiguity, developed abstractly in The Ethics of\nAmbiguity, is erotically embodied in The Second Sex and\nis identified as a crucial piece of the prescription for transcending\nthe oppressions of patriarchy. This description of the liberating\npossibilities of the erotic encounter is also one of those places\nwhere Beauvoir reworks Merleau-Ponty\u2019s phenomenology of\nembodiment. By drawing on Merleau-Ponty\u2019s descriptions of the\nways that we are world-making and world-embedded subject-objects, she\nreveals the ways that it is as subject-objects \u201cfor the\nworld\u201d, \u201cto the world\u201d, and \u201cin the\nworld\u201d that we are passionately drawn to each other.\n\nThe last chapters of The Second Sex, \u201cThe Independent\nWoman\u201d and the \u201cConclusion\u201d, speak of the current\n(1947) status of women\u2019s situation\u2014what has changed and\nwhat remains to be done. Without ignoring the importance of women\ngaining the right to vote and without dismissing the necessity of\nwomen attaining economic independence, Beauvoir finds these liberal\nand Marxist solutions to women\u2019s situation inadequate. They\nignore the effects of women\u2019s socialization (the subject of\nVolume II) and they are inattentive to the ways that masculine norms\nand the masculinist, sovereign subject remain the standard of the\nhuman. The liberated woman must free herself from two shackles: first,\nthe idea that to assume herself as a freedom and be independent she\nmust be like men, and second, the socialization through which she\nbecomes feminized. The first alienates her from her existence as a\n(sexual) subject. The second makes her averse to risking herself for\nher ideas/ideals. Attentive to this current state of affairs, and to\nthe phenomenology of the body, Beauvoir lays out a few prerequisites\nfor liberation. Women must be socialized to engage the world. And,\nthey must be allowed to discover the unique ways that their embodiment\nengages the world. In addition, there must be a complete overhaul of\npatriarchal morality, affective dispositions, and customs that demand\ngirls\u2019 and women\u2019s passivity and deny them their bodily\nautonomy. In short, the myth of the eternal feminine must be\ndismantled. So long as it prevails, economic and political advances\nwill fall short of the goal of liberation.\n\nControversial from the beginning, The Second Sex\u2019s\ncritique of patriarchy continues to challenge social, political and\nreligious categories used to justify women\u2019s inferior status.\nUltimately, what was a phenomenological breakthrough became in The\nSecond Sex a liberatory tool: by attending to the ways that\npatriarchal structures use sexual difference to deprive women of their\n\u201ccan do\u201d embodiment, Beauvoir made the case for declaring\nthis deprivation oppressive. Taken within the context of the feminist\nmovement, this declaration of oppression was an event. It opened the\nway for the consciousness-raising that characterized second-wave\nfeminism. It has and continues to validate the injustices experienced\nby girls and women. What was, from an existential-phenomenological\nperspective, a detailed analysis of the lived body and an ethical and\npolitical indictment of the ways that patriarchy alienates women from\ntheir embodied capacities, was, from a feminist perspective, an appeal\nthat called on women to take up the politics of liberation.\n8. \u201cMust We Burn Sade?\u201d Freedom and the Flesh\n\nWritten in response to a request to author an introduction to\nSade\u2019s Justine, Beauvoir\u2019s essay \u201cMust we\nBurn Sade?\u201d (1951\u20131952) continues her ethical reflections\non the drama of intersubjectivity and her interest in the relationship\nbetween freedom and intimacy. Indeed, what interests Beauvoir about\nSade is that \u201c[he] posed the problem of the other in\nits extremest terms\u201d (1963[1965], 243, cf. 1963, 333). \n\n\u201cMust we Burn Sade?\u201d identifies Sade\u2019s decision to\nwrite as an existential project. Beauvoir credits Sade with uncovering\nthe despotic secrets of the patriarchal political machine. She is\nsympathetic to his utopian appeal to freedom. She finds, however, that\nSade perverted the meaning of freedom. Thus, Beauvoir identifies Sade\nas a great moralist who endorsed an unsatisfactory ethics.\n\nSade is Beauvoir\u2019s Janus-faced ally. She does not refute his\nclaim that cruelty establishes a relationship between the self and the\nother. Sade is correct. Cruelty reveals us to each other in the\nparticularities and ambiguities of our conscious and fleshed\nexistence. The tyrant and victim, Beauvoir tells us, are a genuine\ncouple. They are united by the bonds of the flesh and freedom.\n\nFor Beauvoir, Sade is the epitome of maniacal passion dedicated to the\nproject of cruelty. Because he takes full responsibility for his\nchoices, he must be credited with choosing freedom and accepted as\nbeing authentic. This does not, however, make him either an ethical or\nmoral figure for his choices destroy the intersubjective bonds of\nhumanity. His account of the power of cruelty provides a convincing\ncritique of our social, political and personal hypocrisies, but it\ndoes not critique the ways that cruelty is a perversion of freedom and\nan exploitation of the vulnerability of the flesh. As a result, his\ndescriptions of the powers of cruelty and the meaning of torture are\nincomplete and inadequate. The case of the Marquis de Sade makes it\nclear that assuming responsibility for one\u2019s choices, is a\nnecessary, but not sufficient, condition of an existential ethics of\nfreedom.\n\nIn the end, Beauvoir finds that Sade was misled (which does not mean\nthat he was innocent). He mistook power for freedom and misunderstood\nthe meanings of the erotic. In his fascination with the conflict\nbetween consciousness and the flesh, Sade exposed the failure of the\nsadistic enterprise. In his attempt to lose himself in the pleasures\nof the flesh, and so to experience both the ambiguity of his being as\nconsciousness made flesh (or flesh made consciousness) and the reality\nof his being for and with others, Sade substitutes the spectacle for\nlived experience and accepts counterfeit transactions of domination\nand assimilation/incorporation as genuine relationships of reciprocity\nand gratuitous generosity. In doing so, he never reaches the\nother.\n\nCentering his life in the erotic, Sade missed the truth of the erotic.\nThis truth, Beauvoir tells us, can only be found by those who abandon\nthemselves to the risks of emotional intoxication. Living this\nintoxication we discover the ways that the body turned flesh dissolves\nall arguments against the immediacy of our bonds with each other and\ngrounds an ethic of the appeal, risk and mutual vulnerability.\n\nUltimately, in this essay Beauvoir leaves behind the idea that our\nfreedom, as absolutely internal, is immune from an assault by the\nother, and accepts the radical vulnerability of our lived embodiment.\nIn doing so, the questions of violence and desire cannot be severed\nfrom the question of our shared humanity or questions of ethics and\njustice. In condemning Sade for his perversion of the erotic, Beauvoir\nalso faults him as an artist, which marks a return to the question of\nthe responsibility of the artist raised in The Ethics of\nAmbiguity. Though she accuses him of being a technically poor\nwriter, the heart of her criticism is ethical not aesthetic. According\nto Beauvoir, Sade violated his obligations as an author. Instead of\nrevealing the world to us in its promise and possibilities, and\ninstead of appealing to us to work for justice, he took refuge in the\nimaginary and developed metaphysical justifications for suffering and\ncruelty. In the end, Beauvoir accuses Sade of being the serious man\ndescribed in The Ethics of Ambiguity.\n9. The Long March: Time, Politics, and Possibility\n\nIn 1957 Beauvoir published The Long March, an essay about her\nsix-week visit to China in September and October of 1955. Although a\ntravelogue in many respects, The Long March does not take on\nthe memoir style form of America Day by Day. She undertook\ninterdisciplinary research to inform her descriptions of her visit,\nand like The Second Sex and The Coming of Age,\nBeauvoir mines various sources for ways to engage the observations of\nher trip. She narrates lengthy descriptions of what she saw and\ncritically considers facts and myths of the time. Similar to\nAmerica Day by Day, there are standout themes that exemplify\nBeauvoir\u2019s philosophical and political concerns: labor\nstruggles, the gendered politics of the family, political economy, and\nthe relation between customs, law, and freedom. Beauvoir\u2019s\nmaterialist understanding of struggle and revolution underlies these\nconcerns. For these reasons, this travel writing is also a political\nwriting. Notably, American anti-Communists were outraged when the book\nwas translated into English in 1958.\n\nThe book is at once a response to right-wing French views on China,\nand hence a further criticism of her ongoing disdain for French\nbourgeois ideals, and a consideration of the promise of communist\nChina. While her optimism about communist China is worthy of\ncriticism, Beauvoir\u2019s optimism was not totalizing. She was aware\nand bothered by her curated visit and she expressed her own doubts and\nuncertainties about the reality she encountered. But still, she makes\nno final judgment about China, refusing to have the book serve as a\nmouthpiece for French anticommunist sentiments. Beauvoir was\ninterested in alternatives to bourgeois capitalism and so she engaged\nthe possibilities of communist China. She attended to the formation of\nmeaning as it broke with the past to create a new future, an\nengagement with historical time that is necessary for all political\nprojects. Her descriptions also tend to her perception of the cultural\ndifferences between China and France, yet the outcome can be\ndisappointing. She describes some encounters with Chinese culture and\ntraditions in dismissive ways, which challenges the possibility of\ncross-cultural solidarity.\n\nBeauvoir was deeply unsatisfied with and embarrassed by the book. She\nadmitted it was outdated within years of its publication and believed\nit to be lacking in philosophical rigor. There are also inaccuracies\nand questionable representations in her account. Among scholars, it is\nup for debate whether her intellectual curiosity and Western privilege\nto tour China are part of an orientalizing gaze at work in the text.\nIn spite of, or perhaps even because of, these complicated dimensions\nand the book\u2019s limits, The Long March is another\ninteresting example of Beauvoir\u2019s political voice and exposes\nthe complexities of the appeal. It also invites us to engage the\nlimits of a particular appeal.\n10. Djamila Boupacha: The Concrete Appeal\n\nIn 1962, Beauvoir and Gisile Halimi co-authored the story of Djamila\nBoupacha, an Algerian girl accused of being a terrorist who was\ntortured by the French during the French-Algerian War. This book may\nbe read as an extension of Beauvoir\u2019s critique of the Marquis de\nSade. Instead of fleeing from the horrors of the real into the safety\nof the imaginary, Beauvoir takes up her responsibility as an author to\nexpose and confront realities that the state would rather hide. Her\npurpose in writing is concrete and political. The book is both a\nprotest and an appeal. Countering Sade, Beauvoir and Halimi show that\nthe truth of torture lies in the unjustifiable politics of abusive\npower.\n11. All Men are Mortal, A Very Easy Death, Adieux: A Farewell to Sartre: Finitude, Passion and the Body\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s phenomenological understanding of the lived body can\nalso be tracked in her considerations of the question of human\nfinitude. This question is raised early in her 1946 novel, All Men\nAre Mortal, which is a story of Fosca, a man who chooses to cheat\ndeath. His desire for immortality is driven by his desire to realize\nthe abstract ideal of humanism. Fosca does not embrace immortality to\nescape the ambiguities of the flesh and embodiment. His decision is\nmotivated by his desire to save the world. He believes that time is\nhis enemy, so long as his time is limited. He believes that with\nsufficient time he can bring the humanist project to closure and\nsecure it from failure.\n\nContrary to his initial belief, Fosca learns that time becomes his\nenemy when it stretches endlessly before him. It turns out that time\nis not what he needs to secure his vision. Rather, what he needs is\nthe commitment of others. No amount of time can secure that. As\nimmortal, Fosca confronts the inevitability of failure that haunts\nhumanity. Unlike mortals, however, who, confronted with the\nconstraints of time, take up their failures with passion, Fosca\nbecomes immobilized. Indifference to life replaces the passion for\nlife. In the end, he discovers the crucial truth of ethical action\nfrom his many-generations-removed grandson, Armand. Understanding that\nthe future belongs to others who may or may not take up his projects,\nArmand commits himself to the concrete possibilities of the present.\nHis passion is embodied in the appeal to others, not in an abstract\ngoal that, however just it might seem, would deny future generations\nthe right to determine their own destiny.\n\nIn All Men Are Mortal the givenness of finitude and death\nconcerns our relationship to time. Eighteen years later, writing about\nthe dying and death of her mother in A Very Easy Death\n(1964), and six years after that, analyzing the situation of the aged\nin The Coming of Age (1970), and eleven years subsequent to\nthat, chronicling Sartre\u2019s last days in Adieux: A Farewell\nto Sartre (1981), it is not so much our relationship to time but\nmore a matter of our embodiment that concerns Beauvoir. In A Very\nEasy Death and Adieux, Beauvoir assumes the position of\nthe phenomenological witness. The bodies of her mother and Sartre are\ngiven to us in all their disturbing breakdowns and deteriorations.\nSome have found these works cold, insensitive and even cruel. They\nmiss Beauvoir\u2019s point. She is showing us who we are. The\n\u201cI can\u201d body revealed by other phenomenologists as a\ncrucial mark of embodiment is the limited condition of the mature\nhealthy body. It is but one phase of the life of the body. In its\nearly days the body is still learning its \u201cI can\u2019s\u201d.\nAs we age, the body begins losing them. It is one thing, as with the\nmyth of Woman, to alienate an \u201cI can\u201d from its capacities.\nIt is quite another to refuse to attend to the full range of embodied\nlife and to assess the value of that life in terms of its \u201cI\ncan\u201d possibilities.\n12. The Coming of Age: The Other Again\n\nWe need to read A Very Easy Death and Adieux within\nthe context of the analyses of The Coming of Age to fully\nappreciate Beauvoir\u2019s role as witness. The project of The\nComing of Age is similar to that of The Second Sex. Like\nThe Second Sex, it focuses on a group of people designated as\nOther; like The Second Sex it exposes the mythical status of\nthe \u201cfacts\u201d about aging and the aged; and like The\nSecond Sex it indicts society for its dehumanization of those it\ndesignates as Other. The Coming of Age also emulates The\nSecond Sex in its method and scope. It brings a phenomenological\nlens to bear on biological, psychological, historical, economic, and\nsociological factors in order to understand the phenomenon of a\nparticular kind of marginalized otherness. \n\nIn The Coming of Age, Beauvoir considers the injustices\nendured by the aged. She describes the experiences of old age and\nargues that it throws one into the position of the Other not by\nnecessity, but as a result of culturally produced stigmas and a\nsocietal loathing of aging. Thus, while the process of aging may be\ninescapable, old age as a situation of Otherness is not. This\nnon-subject status is a matter of the conditions of experience that\nforeclose transcendence, including myths, societal attitudes, and the\neconomic conditions of the aged. Whereas in The Second Sex,\nBeauvoir accused patriarchy of depriving women of their subject\nstatus, The Coming of Age argues that the non-subject status\nof the aged can be traced to the fact that they are barred from\nexistential projects and meaningful relationships with others. To\nexperience old age in this way, Beauvoir argues, is to be denied\none\u2019s humanity. \u201cThe old man\u201d, Beauvoir writes,\n\u201clooks to active members of the community like one of a\n\u2018different species\u2019\u201d because he is not engaged in a\nproject (1970[1972], 231, cf. 1972, 217).\n\nLike The Second Sex, which attended to the givens of biology\nwithout allowing them to determine the meaning of the subject, The\nComing of Age also gives biology its due. The lack of engagement\nof the aged, Beauvoir notes, is in part imposed from without and in\npart comes from within; for as we age, the body is transformed from an\ninstrument that engages the world into a hindrance that makes our\naccess to the world difficult. The point of The Coming of\nAge, however, is that it is unjust to use these difficulties to\njustify reducing the aged to the status of the Other.\nAdieux\u2019s witnessing makes this point clearly. However\ndiminished Sartre\u2019s body became, it never severed him from his\nprojects. He could not have sustained his work by himself, however.\nRather, he was in a situation where others refused to marginalize him.\nThey did not equate his diminished bodily capacities with a diminished\nhumanity. The Coming of Age argues that the situation of a\nprivileged Sartre ought to be our common destiny.\n\nIn a world that recognized the phenomenological truth of the body, the\nexistential truth of freedom, the Marxist truth of exploitation and\nthe human truth of the bond, the derogatory category of the Other\nwould be eradicated. Neither the aged nor women, nor anyone by virtue\nof their race, class, ethnicity or religion would find themselves\nrendered inessential. Beauvoir knows that it is too much to hope for\nsuch a world. She understands the lures of domination and violence.\nThroughout her career, however, she used philosophical and literary\ntools to reveal the possibilities of such a world and appealed to us\nto work for it.\n13. Life Writings: Situation, Becoming and the Self-Other Relation\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s practices of writing the self were deeply connected\nto her philosophical ideas. Indeed, for Beauvoir, living is\nphilosophy, a point that is evident in her autobiographical works.\nBeauvoir wrote a four-volume autobiography where she recounts\nfifty-four years of her life, from the years 1908\u20131962. In\nMemoirs of a Dutiful Daughter (1958), Beauvoir narrates the\nformative years of 1908\u20131929, while The Prime of Life\ncovers 1929\u20131944. Force of Circumstance (1963) is\nwritten in two volumes, 1944\u20131952 (After the War) and\n1952\u20131962 (Hard Times). Beauvoir was also a devoted\ndiarist. Her diaries, including Diary of a Philosophy Student\nVolume 1 (1926\u201327) and Volume 2 (1928\u201329),\nand her Wartime Diaries, often complicate the narration of\nher autobiographies, exposing different details of her life and thus\nexpose a different Beauvoir to the reader. For Beauvoir, diary writing\nwas an integral part of self-understanding and self-making. The\nsignificance of these autobiographical works is threefold. They offer\na detailed account of events, experiences and relations with others\nout of which Beauvoir made her self, that is, these works reveal how\nshe became Beauvoir. They also shed light on Beauvoir\u2019s\nphilosophical trajectory, intellectual influences, the ideas and\nthemes central to her novels and philosophical works, and they offer\nglaring evidence that her philosophical ideas developed prior to,\nalongside, and often against Sartre\u2019s.\n\nIn writing her life, it is evident that the notion of situation, the\nset of concrete circumstances, including one\u2019s embodiment that\nsignificantly shapes but does not fix one\u2019s existence, is\ncentral to Beauvoir\u2019s philosophy of self. It is only in living\nand living out one\u2019s choices, constrained but not determined by\nsocial and historical context, that one\u2019s existence takes shape.\nBeauvoir\u2019s autobiographical writings make clear that her\nsituation as a girl raised in a Catholic, bourgeois household, as a\nwoman with a certain level of independence and privilege, an\nintellectual, a writer, a leftist living amidst and in the aftermath\nof war and colonial projects, are all generative circumstances for\nher. She is neither the mere product of circumstance nor does she just\nwill herself into existence. Yet, her understanding of\n\u2018situation\u2019 takes time to develop, as Beauvoir herself\nnotes that she did not always recognize the force of circumstance.\nThough, perhaps that she did not recognize this to be the case was a\nconstraint of her own particular situation. In The Prime of\nLife, for instance, the Beauvoir we read about is still full of\nbourgeois idealism and is focused on happiness, which she marks as\ncharacteristic of the times. Ultimately, in narrating her experience,\nBeauvoir discloses the connection between the personal and the\ncollective, and the distinctness of a self unfolding in time.\n\nThe ethical significance Beauvoir places on the self-other relation is\nalso central to her autobiographical writings. Although it is not\nuntil 1939 that she rejects individualism, Beauvoir\u2019s younger\nyears show a deep interest in her relationships with others. Her\nrelationship with her parents and her love for Zaza and her cousin\nJacques, for instance, reveal the capacity of others to open and close\nthe world and to make and remake the self. Indeed, there is a robust\nphilosophy of love across Beauvoir\u2019s personal writings,\nincluding her love with Zaza (fictionalized in Inseparable),\nto the complicated relationship with Sartre, to her longing for Nelson\nAlgren (detailed further in A Transatlantic Love Affair, her\npublished letters to Algren), to her discussion of She Came to\nStay and the narration of the triad with Olga in The Prime of\nLife, that speak not only to Beauvoir\u2019s preoccupations with\nthe role of love in life more generally, but to the bond between self\nand other that takes shape in an erotic encounter. In Force of\nCircumstance, Beauvoir considers the self-other relation in more\npolitical terms as she describes the politicization of her private\nexistence and the Algerian War and colonial oppression.\nBeauvoir\u2019s attention to the Algerian War was an encounter that\nplaced an ethical demand on her, out of which she politicized and so\nreshaped her self.\n\nFor Beauvoir, the writing of her life, including writing about her\ndesire to write, is ultimately a way to disclose the ambiguities of\nconcrete existence. The detail at which Beauvoir narrates her life,\nincluding the omissions she makes, which are exposed in her diaries,\noffers important insights about Beauvoir\u2019s philosophical ideas\nand their emergence within and out of her experience. These writings\nare also philosophically significant investigations of the meaning of\nexistence and an ethics, one that is not laid out programmatically but\nthat is disclosed in the joys, banality, and failures of living.\n14. Influence and Current Scholarship\n\nBeauvoir is no doubt a feminist icon and one of the most impactful\nfeminist thinkers of the twentieth century. The Second Sex,\ntranslated in 40 languages, has inspired generations of women to\nchallenge their status and pursue freedom. In spite of her impact,\nreadings and receptions of Beauvoir among feminist scholars were\ninitially largely antagonistic. The renaissance in Beauvoir\nscholarship served as a response. While difficult to pin down its\nexact beginning, it was after Beauvoir\u2019s death in 1986 that\ndifferent questions about and inquiries into her thinking became more\nprevalent. The Second Sex has also been the source of\nimportant debate and criticism in the interdisciplinary field of\nfeminist theory, and even among those who distance themselves from her\nwork, it has been no less impactful. For instance, Beauvoir\u2019s\nlegacy is apparent in the work of more contemporary thinkers like Sara\nAhmed, Judith Butler, bell hooks, and Luce Irigaray.\n\nA significant aspect of the renewal in Beauvoir scholarship has much\nto do with the posthumous availability of previously unpublished\npersonal writings, the increasing number of works translated into\nEnglish, especially those in the Beauvoir Series published by\nUniversity of Illinois Press, and the 2010 new English translation of\nThe Second Sex. Access to such work, made possible by the\nlabor of Beauvoir scholars, has helped shed light on Beauvoir\u2019s\nphilosophical influences and her own criticisms of and distance from\nSartre. That access has also challenged misinterpretations stemming\nfrom inadequate translations and has encouraged interest in and more\nthorough engagement with Beauvoir\u2019s work beyond The Second\nSex. The interdisciplinary, peer-reviewed journal, Simone de\nBeauvoir Studies, founded in 1983 and reorganized in 2016, and\nthe International Simone de Beauvoir Society, are important venues for\nthe study of Beauvoir\u2019s life and works.\n\nGiven the scope of Beauvoir\u2019s influence internationally and\ninterdisciplinarily, it is difficult to succinctly capture her legacy.\nThe following highlights a few key areas scholarship: Beauvoir\u2019s\noriginal philosophical contributions to existentialism (e.g., Le\nDoeuff 1980; Butler 1986; Kruks 1990 and 2001; Fullbrook and Fullbrook\n1994; Gothlin 1999; Arp 2001; Kail 2006; Deutscher 2008; Daigle and\nColomb 2009) and phenomenology (Bergoffen 1997; Hein\u00e4maa 1997 and\n2003; Oksala 2016 and 2022; Mann 2018); her contributions to ethics\n(e.g., Gothlin 1995; Tidd 1999a and 1999b; Stoller 2014) and political\ntheory (e.g., Kruks 2012;); situating The Second Sex\nphilosophically (e.g., Bauer 2001; Lundgren-Gothlin 1991; Moi 2001;\nSimons 2001; Hein\u00e4maa 2003; Mann and Ferrari 2017); the\nhistorical and global receptions of The Second Sex (e.g.,\nChaperon 1999; Dongchao 2005; Coffin 2020; Rouch 2019 ; Chaperon and\nRouch 2020); the limitations of The Second Sex with regard to\nrace and ethnocentrism (e.g., Spelman 1988; Simons 2001; Deutscher\n2008; Belle 2010, 2014 and 2017; hooks 2012; Berruz 2016; Collins\n2017; Jones 2019; Altman 2020); her perspective on race and racism in\nAmerica Day by Day (e.g., Alfonso 2005; Bernasconi 2019;\nAltman 2020; Mussett 2020); Beauvoir\u2019s engagement with the\ninjustices of French colonialism and her position as a colonizer\n(e.g., Surkis 2010; Nya 2019); critical engagement with\nBeauvoir\u2019s life (e.g., Moi 2009) and personal writings (e.g.,\nTidd 1999b); and biographical projects (Bair 2002; Kirkpatrick\n2019).\n\nAdditionally, Beauvoir\u2019s work inspires feminist philosophical\nanalyses of various lived experiences, such as embodiment and\noppression (Young 1980; Bartky 1990; Burke 2019; Froidevaux-Mettiere\n2021), patriarchal love (Mann 2009), masculinity and nationalism (Mann\n2014), hook-up culture (Bauer 2017), #BlackGirlJoy (Mason 2018),\nstreet harassment (Vera-Gray 2018), feminine submission (Garcia 2018),\nbody positivity (Leboeuf 2019); trans subjectivity (Antonopoulos 2017;\nBurke 2020), non-monogamy (Kean 2018; Anderson 2021), #MeToo (McKinney\n2019; Melo Lopes 2021), obstetric violence (Shabot 2021), old age\n(Stoller 2014; Kruks 2022); rape (Bergoffen 2017); and authenticity\n(Cleary 2022).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Beauvoir", "Secondary Literature", "Secondary Literature: Anthologies"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Beauvoir": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1927, <em>4e cahier</em>, holograph manuscript, Paris:\nBiblioth\u00e8que Nationale.", "1928\u201329, <em>Carnet 6</em>, holograph manuscript, Paris:\nBiblioth\u00e8que Nationale.", "1929\u201331, <em>Carnet 7</em>, holograph manuscript, Paris:\nBiblioth\u00e8que Nationale.", "1943 [1954], <em>L\u2019Invit\u00e9e</em>, Paris: Gallimard;\ntranslated as <em>She Came to Stay</em>, Yvonne Moyse and Roger\nSenhouse (trans.), Cleveland, OH: World Publishing, 1954.", "[P&amp;C] 1944, <em>Pyrrhus et Cin\u00e9as: A Cette Dame</em>,\nParis: Editions Gallimard; translated as \u201cPyrrhus and Cineas: A\nCette Dame\u201d, Marybeth Timmerman (trans.), in PhilW:\n89\u2013149.", "1945a, \u201cLa Ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologie de la perception de\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty\u201d, <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>, 1(2):\n363\u2013367; translated as \u201cA Review of The Phenomenology of\nPerception by Maurice Merleau-Ponty\u201d, in Marybeth Timmerman\n(trans.), PhilW: 159\u2013164.", "1945b, \u201cId\u00e9alisme moral et r\u00e9alisme\npolitique\u201d, <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>, 1(2): 248\u2013268.\nReprinted in ESN: 49\u201388; translated as \u201cMoral Idealism and\nPolitical Realism\u201d, Anne Deing Cordero (trans.), in PhilW:\n175\u2013193.", "1945c, \u201cL\u2019existentialisme et la sagesse des\nnations\u201d, <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>, 1(3): 385\u2013404.\nReprinted in ESN: 13\u201348; translated as \u201cExistentialism and\nPopular Wisdom\u201d, Marybeth Timmerman (trans.) in PhilW:\n203\u2013220.", "1945d, untitled and undated manuscript.
