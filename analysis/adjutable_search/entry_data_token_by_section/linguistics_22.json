    "main_text": "Language Evolution || Phylogenetic emergence\n5.1 Phylogenetic emergence\n\nEmergentists tend to regard any of the topics (a)\u2013(d) as\npotentially relevant to the study of language evolution. Essentialists\ntend to focus solely on (c). Some Essentialists even deny that (a) and\n(b) have any relevance to the study of (c); for example:\n\nThere is nothing useful to be said about behavior or thought at the\nlevel of abstraction at which animal and human communication fall\ntogether\u2026 [H]uman language, it appears, is based on entirely\ndifferent principles. This, I think, is an important point, often\noverlooked by those who approach language as a natural, biological\nphenomenon; in particular, it seems rather pointless, for these\nreasons, to speculate about the evolution of human language from\nsimpler systems\u2026 (Chomsky 1968: 62)\n\n\nOther generative Essentialists, like Pinker and Bloom (1990) and\nPinker and Jackendoff (2005), seem open to the view that even the most\nelemental aspects of topic (b) can be directly relevant to the study\nof (c). This division among Essentialists reflects a division among\ntheir views about the role of adaptive explanations in the emergence\nof (b) and especially (c). For example:\n\nWe know very little about what happens when 1010 neurons\nare crammed into something the size of a basketball, with further\nconditions imposed by the specific manner in which this system\ndeveloped over time. It would be a serious error to suppose that all\nproperties, or the interesting properties of the structures that\nevolved, can be \u2018explained\u2019 in terms of \u2018natural\nselection\u2019. (Chomsky 1975:59, quoted by Newmeyer 1998 and\nJackendoff 2002)\n\n\nThe view expressed here that all (or even most) interesting properties\nof the language faculty are not adaptations conflicts with the basic\nexplanatory strategy of evolutionary psychology found in the\nneo-Darwinian Essentialist views of Pinker and Bloom.\nPiattelli-Palmarini (1989), following Chomsky, adopts a fairly\nstandard Bauplan critique of adaptationism. On this view the language\nfaculty did not originate as an adaptation, but more plausibly\n\u201cmay have originally arisen for some purely architectural or\nstructural reason (perhaps overall brain size, or the sheer\nduplication of pre-existing modules), or as a by product of the\nevolutionary pressures\u201d (p. 19), i.e., it is a kind of Gouldian\nspandrel.\n\nMore recently, some Essentialist-leaning authors have rejected the\nview that no analogies and homologies between animal and human\ncommunication are relevant to the study of language. For example, in\nthe context of commenting on Hauser et al. (2002), Tecumseh Fitch\n(2010) claims that \u201cAlthough Language, writ large, is unique to\nour species (many probably most) of the mechanisms involved in\nlanguage have analogues or homologues in other animals.\u201d\nHowever, the view that the investigation of animal communication can\nshed light on human language is still firmly rejected by some. For\nexample, Bickerton (2007: 512) asserts that \u201cnothing resembling\nhuman language could have developed from prior animal call\nsystems.\u201d \n\nBickerton fronts the following simple argument for his view:\n\nIf any adaptation is unique to a species, the selective pressure that\ndrove it must also be unique to that species; otherwise the adaptation\nwould have appeared elsewhere, at least in rudimentary form. (2007:\n514)\n\n\nThus, the mere fact that language is unique to humans is sufficient to\nrule out monkey and primate call systems as preadapations for\nlanguage. But, contra Bickerton, a neo-Darwinian like\nJackendoff (2002) appeals to the work of Dunbar (1998), Power (1998),\nWorden (1998) to provide a selectionist story which assumes that\ncooperation in hunting, defense (Pinker and Bloom 1990), and \u201c\n\u2018social grooming\u2019 or deception\u201d are selective forces\nthat operated on human ancestors to drive increases in expressive\npower that distinguishes non-human communication and human linguistic\ncapacities and systems. Bickerton (2014), however, combines aspects of\nEssentialism, Emergentism, and Externalism by taking equal parts of\nMinimalism, primatology, and cultural evolution into a more holistic\naccount. He specifically tailors a niche construction theory to\nexplain the emergence of displaced, discrete symbolization in a\nparticular kind of primate, namely human beings. He thus allows for\n(a) and (b) to figure in an explanation of (c). This is somewhat of a\ndeparture from his earlier positions.\n\nWithin the general Essentialist camp, language evolution has taken\ncenter stage since the inception of the Minimalist Program. An\nexplanation of the evolution of language now became one of the main\ntheoretical driving forces behind linguistic theory and explanation.\nAgain, the focus seems to have stayed largely on (c). Berwick and\nChomsky explicitly state:\n\n\nAt some time in the very recent past, apparently sometime before\n80,000 years ago, if we can judge from associated symbolic proxies,\nindividuals in a small group of hominids in East Africa underwent a\nminor biological change that provided the operation Merge-an operation\nthat takes human concepts as computational atoms and yields structured\nexpressions that, systematically interpreted by the conceptual system,\nprovide a rich language of thought. (2016: 87)\n\n\nSuch theories rely heavily on the possibility of the evolution of\nlanguage being explained in terms of saltation or random mutation.\nThis postulate has come under significant scrutiny (see Steedman\n2017). Saltation views, however, rely on one of the core assumptions\nmentioned in the quote above, i.e. that language evolved circa 100 000\nyears old. This central claim has recently been challenged by Everett\n(2017) who cites paleontological evidence from the alleged nautical\nabilities of Homo Erectus to dismantle this timeline. If\ntrue, this would mean that language evolved around two million years\nago and random mutation need not be the only viable explanation as\nmany in the Essentialist framework assume (see Progovac 2015 for a\nparticular gradualist account). \n\nWhile generative Essentialists debate among themselves about the\nplausibility of adaptive explanations for the emergence of essential\nfeatures of a modular language capacity, Emergentists are perhaps best\ncharacterized as seeking broad evolutionary explanations of the\nfeatures of languages (topic (c)) and communicative capacities (topics\n(b) and (c)) conceived in non-essentialist, non-modular ways. And as\ntheorists who are committed to exploring non-modular views of\nlinguistic capacities (topic (c)), the differences and similarities\nbetween (a) and (b) are potentially relevant to (c).\n\nPrimatologists like Cheney and Seyfarth, psychologists like Tomasello,\nanthropologists like Terrence Deacon, and linguists like Phillip\nLieberman share an interest in investigating the communicative,\nanatomical, and cognitive characteristics of non-human animals to\nidentify biological differences between humans, and monkeys and\nprimates. In the following paragraph we discuss Cheney and Seyfarth\n(2005) as an example, but we could easily have chosen any of a number\nof other theorists.\n\nCheney and Seyfarth (2005) emphasize that non-human primates have a\nsmall, stimulus specific repertoire of vocal productions that are not\n\u201centirely involuntary,\u201d and this contrasts with their\n\u201calmost openended ability to learn novel sound-meaning\npairs\u201d (p. 149). They also emphasize that vocalizations in\nmonkeys and apes are used to communicate information about the\nvocalizer, not to provide information intended to \u201crectify false\nbeliefs in others or instruct others\u201d (p. 150). Non-human\nprimate communication consists in the mainly involuntary broadcasting\nof the vocalizer\u2019s current affective state. Moreover, although\nCheney and Seyfarth recognize that the vervet monkey\u2019s\ncelebrated call system (Cheney and Seyfarth 1990) is\n\u201cfunctionally referential\u201d in context, their calls have no\nexplicit meaning since they lack \u201cany propositional\nstructure\u201d. From this they conclude:\n\nThe communication of non-human animals lacks three features that are\nabundantly present in the utterances of young children: a rudimentary\nability to attribute mental states different from their own to others,\nthe ability to generate new words, and lexical syntax. (2005: 151)\n\n\nBy \u2018lexical syntax\u2019 Cheney and Seyfarth mean a kind of\nsemantic compositionality of characteristic vocalizations. If a\nvocalization (call) were to have lexical syntax, the semantic\nsignificance of the whole would depend on the relation of the\nstructure of parts of the call to the structure of what they signify.\nThe absence of \u2018lexical syntax\u2019 in call systems suggests\nthat it is illegitimate to think of them as having anything like\nsemantic structure at all.\n\nDespite the rudimentary character of animal communication systems when\ncompared with human languages, Cheney and Seyfarth argue that monkeys\nand apes exhibit at least five characteristics that are\npre-adaptations for human communication:\n\ntheir vocalizations are representational;\nthey have competitive/cooperative relations in which alliances,\nfriendships, and rivalries that \u201ccreate selective pressures for\nthe kind of complex, abstract conceptual abilities that are likely to\nhave proceeded the earlier linguistic communication\u201d;\nbecause of (ii), their representations of social relations between\nindividuals and themselves are hierarchally structured;\ncertain monkeys, e.g. baboons, have open-ended, rule-governed\nsystems of social knowledge;\ntheir knowledge is propositional.\n\n\nIt is, of course, controversial to claim that monkeys have\nrule-governed propositional social knowledge systems as claimed in\n(iv) and (v). For instance, Tomasello\u2019s (2008)\n\u2018Cooperative Communication\u2019 approach makes a case for\nprimate intentional systems not based on their vocalizations but on\ntheir gestural systems. Therein he claims that \u201cgreat ape\ngestural communication shares with human linguistic communication\nfoundational aspects of its manner of functioning, namely, the\nintentional and flexible use of learned communicative signals\u201d\n(2008: 21).\n\nBut Emergentists, Externalists, and Essentialists could all, in\nprinciple, agree that there are both unique characteristics of human\ncommunicative capacities and characteristics of such capacities that\nare shared with non-humans. For example, by the age of one, human\ninfants can use direction of gaze and focus of attention to infer the\nreferent of a speaker\u2019s utterance (Baldwin and Moses 1994). By\ncontrast, this sort of social referencing capacity in monkeys and apes\nis rudimentary. This suggests that a major component of humans\u2019\ncapacity to infer a specific referent is lacking in non-humans.\n\nDisagreements between the approaches might be due to the perceived\nsignificance of non-human communicative capacities and their relation\nto uniquely human ones.\n",
