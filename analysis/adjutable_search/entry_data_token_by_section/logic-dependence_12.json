    "main_text": "Variants of dependence logic || Generalized Dependencies and Connectives in Team Semantics\n4.5 Generalized Dependencies and Connectives in Team Semantics\n\nThe variants and extensions of Dependence Logic seen above are all\ngenerated from First Order Logic (with Team Semantics) by introducing\nnew atoms or connectives. It is possible to consider generalized\ndependence atoms (Kuusisto 2015), much in the same way in which\ngeneralized quantifiers are introduced in classical First Order Logic,\nand ask questions like:\n\nFor which collections \\(\\mathcal D\\) of atoms or connectives is it\nthe case that \\(\\mathbf{FO}(\\mathcal D)\\) (i.e., First Order Logic\naugmented by the atoms and connectives in \\(\\mathcal D\\)) is\nexpressively equivalent to First Order Logic? Such collections\n\\(\\mathcal D\\) are said to be strongly first order.\nGiven a collection \\(\\mathcal D\\) of atoms and connectives, for\nwhich other collections \\(\\mathcal E\\) of atoms and connectives is it\nthe case that \\(\\mathbf{FO}(\\mathcal D, \\mathcal E)\\) is expressively\nequivalent to \\(\\mathbf{FO}(\\mathcal D)\\)? Such \\(\\mathcal E\\) are\nsaid to be safe for \\(\\mathcal D\\).\n\n\nNo complete answer to these questions is known at the moment. Some\npartial results, however, are known:\n\nIf \\(\\mathcal D\\) is a collection of upwards closed dependencies\n(that is to say, dependencies that, if true of some team \\(X\\) in some\nmodel \\(M\\), are also true of any superteam \\(Y \\supseteq X\\) in the\nsame model), plus possibly the constancy atom (that is, the\nalready-mentioned special case of the dependence atom that states that\nsome variable is constant over a team), then \\(\\mathcal D\\) is\nstrongly first order (Galliani 2015);\nNot all strongly first order dependencies are safe for all\ndependencies: in particular, the constancy atom is not safe for\nunary inclusion dependencies \\(x \\subseteq y\\), where \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are single variables; the possibility operator \\(\\diamond\n\\phi\\), which is satisfied by a team \\(X\\) in a model \\(M\\) if and\nonly if there is a nonempty subset of X that satisfies \\(\\phi\\) in\n\\(M\\), is instead safe for all collections of dependencies, as are the\ntotality atom (that states that some variable, or tuple of variables,\ntakes all possible values) and the non-constancy atom (that states\nthat some variable takes at least two different values in a team)\n(Galliani forthcoming);\nIf \\(\\mathcal D\\) is a strongly first order collection of\ndependencies and \\(\\mathcal E\\) is a collection of downwards closed\ndependencies (that is, dependencies that whenever true of some team\nthey are also true of every subteam), then \\(\\mathcal D\\) is safe for\n\\(\\mathcal E\\) (Galliani 2019); \nIf \\(\\mathcal D\\) is a collection of dependencies that are\ndownwards closed and relativizable (that is to say, adding\nrelativizations of dependencies in \\(\\mathcal D\\) to unary predicates\n\\(P\\) to the language is no more expressive than adding the\ndependencies themselves), then \\(\\mathcal D\\) is strongly first order\nif and only if every dependence in it can be defined in terms of\nconstancy atoms (Galliani 2019). \n\n\nThese are all partial results, however, and the general theory of\ndependencies and connectives in Team Semantics is still in its\ninfancy.\n \nA related topic is the study of extensions of Dependence Logic via\ngeneralized quantifiers (Engstr\u00f6m 2012). An interesting result\nalong these lines consists in axiomatization for the extension of\nDependence Logic via the quantifier \\(Q\\) \u201cthere exist\nuncountably many\u2026\u201d, which is sound and complete for the\n\\(\\textbf{FO}(Q)\\) consequences of a theory (Engstr\u00f6m, Kontinen\n& V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2017).\n \nAlso worth pointing out in this context is the work of (Kontinen\n& Yang 2019), which found a logic based on Team Semantics (with\ndifferent choices of connectives than the \u201cstandard\u201d ones\nof Dependence Logic) whose formulas capture precisely the\nfirst-order-definable properties of teams.\n",
