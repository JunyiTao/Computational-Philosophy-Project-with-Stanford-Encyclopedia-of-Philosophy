    "main_text": "Situations in direct perception reports\n1. Situations in direct perception reports\n\nSituations entered natural language semantics with Jon Barwise\u2019s\npaper Scenes and Other Situations (Barwise 1981), followed by\nBarwise and Perry\u2019s Situations and Attitudes (Barwise\n& Perry 1983). Scenes and Other Situations is about the\nmeaning of direct (or epistemically neutral) perception reports, a\nconstruction illustrated in (1):\n\n(1)\nBeryl saw Meryl feed the animals.\n\n\nDirect perception reports contrast with indirect (or epistemically\npositive) perception reports, which typically have finite embedded\nclauses, as in (2):\n\n(2)\nBeryl saw that Meryl fed the animals.\n\n\nBoth (1) and (2) presuppose that Meryl fed the animals. But (1) and\n(2) still differ with respect to the interpretation of their embedded\ncomplements: the embedded complement in (1) can only be interpreted as\ntransparent, and this is not so for the embedded complement in (2).\nThe transparency of the embedded complement in (1) is shown by the\nvalidity of inferences like that in (3), for example:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nBeryl saw Meryl sprinkle the white powder on Cheryl\u2019s\ndinner.\n\nThe white powder was the most deadly poison.\n\nBeryl saw Meryl sprinkle the most deadly poison on\nCheryl\u2019s dinner.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to (3), the first sentence in (4) has an interpretation\nthat renders the inference in (4) invalid.\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nBeryl saw that Meryl sprinkled the white powder on\nCheryl\u2019s dinner.\n\nThe white powder was the most deadly poison.\n\nBeryl saw that Meryl sprinkled the most deadly poison on\nCheryl\u2019s dinner. \n\n\n\nA semantic analysis of direct perception reports has to explain what\nit is that forces their complements to be transparent. Barwise 1981\nproposes to analyze direct perception reports like (1) along the lines\nof (5):\n\n(5)\nThere is an actual past situation s that Beryl saw, and\ns supports the truth of Meryl feed the animals.\n\n\nThe virtues of Barwise\u2019s analysis can be appreciated even\nwithout seeing the exact details of how situations might support the\ntruth of sentences. In (5) the verb see semantically selects\nsituations rather than propositions as its first argument, and this\nhas the desirable effect that the truth value of those sentences does\nnot change when the description of the perceived situation is replaced\nby an extensionally equivalent one. If Meryl fed the animals just once\nin the actual world, and she fed them hay, then the set of actual\nsituations that support the truth of Meryl feed the animals\nis expected to be the same as the set of actual situations that\nsupport the truth of Meryl feed the animals hay. But then (5)\nand (6) must have the same actual truth-value, and Barwise\u2019s\nanalysis predicts correctly that (1) and (7) must, too.\n\n(6)\nThere is an actual past situation s that Beryl saw, and\ns supports the truth of Meryl feed the animals\nhay.\n(7)\nBeryl saw Meryl feed the animals hay.\n\n\nThe publication of Barwise 1981 in the Journal of Philosophy\nwas followed by two papers providing commentary: Higginbotham 1983 in\nthe same journal, and Vlach 1983 in Synthese. The peer\nverdict on situations was that they were not needed for the semantics\nof direct perception reports: the facts could just as well be\nexplained by Davidsonian event semantics. (Davidson 1967a, 1980. See\nthe entries\n Donald Davidson\n and\n events.)\n In fact, Barwise\u2019s argument showing that direct perception\nsee selects a situation is very much like Davidson\u2019s\nargument showing that the verb cause expresses a relation\nbetween events (Davidson 1967b, 1980). Comparison with Davidsonian\nevent semantics has been an issue for situation semantics throughout\nits history. The relation between situation semantics and Davidsonian\nevent semantics will be taken up in section 9.\n",
