    "main_text": "Newtonian Absolute Space in the Twentieth Century || The Spacetime Approach\n5.1 The Spacetime Approach\n\nAfter the development of relativity theory (a topic that we address in\nthe companion article), and its interpretation as a spacetime\ntheory, it was realized that the notion of spacetime had applicability\nto a range of theories of mechanics, classical as well as\nrelativistic. In particular, there is a spacetime geometry \u2013\n\u2018Galilean\u2019 or \u2018neo-Newtonian\u2019 spacetime (the\nterms are interchangeable) \u2013 for Newtonian mechanics that solves\nthe problem of absolute velocity; an idea exploited by a number of\nphilosophers from the late 1960s onwards (e.g., Stein 1968, Earman\n1970, Sklar 1974, and Friedman 1983). For details the reader is\nreferred to the entry on\n spacetime: inertial frames,\n but the general idea is that although a spatial distance is\nwell-defined between any two simultaneous points of this spacetime,\nonly the temporal interval is well-defined between non-simultaneous\npoints. Thus things are rather unlike Newton\u2019s absolute space,\nwhose points persist through time and maintain their distances: in\nabsolute space the distance between p-now and q-then\n(where p and q are points) is just the distance\nbetween p-now and q-now. However, Galilean spacetime\nhas an \u2018affine connection\u2019 which effectively specifies for\nevery point of every continuous curve, the rate at which the curve is\nchanging from straightness at that point; for instance, the straight\nlines are picked out as those curves whose rate of change from\nstraightness is zero at every\n point.[9]\n\nSince the trajectories of bodies are curves in spacetime, the affine\nconnection determines the rate of change from straightness at every\npoint of every possible trajectory. The straight trajectories thus\ndefined can be interpreted as the trajectories of bodies moving\ninertially (i.e., without forces), and the rate of change from\nstraightness of any trajectory can be interpreted as the acceleration\nof a body following that trajectory. That is, Newton\u2019s First Law\ncan be given a geometric formulation as \u2018bodies on which no net\nforces act follow straight lines in spacetime\u2019; similarly, the\nSecond Law can be formulated as \u2018the rate of change from\nstraightness of a body\u2019s trajectory is equal to the forces\nacting on the body divided by its mass\u2019. The significance of\nthis geometry is that while acceleration is well-defined, velocity is\nnot \u2013 in accordance with the empirical determinability of\nacceleration (generally though not universally) but not of velocity,\naccording to Newtonian mechanics. Thus Galilean spacetime gives a very\nnice interpretation of the choice that nature makes when it decides\nthat the laws of mechanics should be formulated in terms of\naccelerations not velocities. (In fact, there are complications here:\nin light of Newton\u2019s Corollary VI mentioned above, one might\nwonder whether even Galilean spacetime is the appropriate spacetime\nstructure for Newtonian mechanics. Saunders (2013), for example,\nargues that in fact only a yet more impoverished spacetime structure\n\u2013 \u2018Newton-Huygens spacetime\u2019 \u2013 is needed.)\n",
