    "main_text": "The place of PIT in logical space || Other views of the relationship between consciousness and intentionality\n3.2 Other views of the relationship between consciousness and intentionality\n\nRepresentationalism (or intentionalism) is the view\nthat phenomenal states are intentional states that meet certain\nfurther conditions (Harman 1990, Dretske 1995, Lycan 1996, Tye 2000,\nByrne 2001, Chalmers 2004; see also the entry\n Representational Theories of Consciousness).\n As in the case of PIT, some versions of representationalism are\nreductive while others are not. When one says that phenomenal states\nare intentional states that meet certain conditions, one might intend\nthis as a reduction of phenomenal consciousness or one might merely\nintend to point out a true identity. As in the case of PIT, many\nproponents of representationalism take the view to be reductive. \n\nThe reductive versions of representationalism and PIT are\nincompatible: if consciousness reduces to intentionality, then\nintentionality does not reduce to consciousness, and vice-versa.\nHowever, versions of PIT and representationalism that are not\nreductive are compatible. It is common for the two views to be\ncombined: many advocates of PIT also endorse a version of\nrepresentationalism, claiming that all phenomenal states are also\nrepresentational states (Horgan and Tienson 2002, Graham, Horgan, and\nTienson 2007, Pautz 2010, Mendelovici 2013, 2018, Bourget 2010). In the\nother direction, representationalism, as we are understanding the\nview, is committed to Weak PIT, because it entails that some\nintentional states are phenomenal states.\n\nAnother view of the relationship between intentionality and\nconsciousness is what Horgan & Tienson dub\n\u201cseparatism\u201d, the view that consciousness and\nintentionality are wholly distinct mental phenomena (see e.g., Kim\n1998). On this view, consciousness and intentionality do not bear\ninteresting metaphysical relations to each other. For example, there\nis no identity or grounding relation between them (separatists reject\nboth PIT and representationalism). Separatism is typically associated\nwith the view that consciousness is limited to perceptual and sensory\nstates, and intentionality is limited to beliefs, desires, and other\npropositional attitudes. \n",
