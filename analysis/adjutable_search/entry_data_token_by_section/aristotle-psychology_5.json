    "main_text": "Perception\n6. Perception\n\n\nAristotle devotes a great deal of attention to perception,\ndiscussing both the general faculty and the individual senses. In both\ncases, his discussions are cast in hylomorphic terms. Perception is the\ncapacity of the soul which distinguishes animals from plants; indeed,\nhaving a perceptive faculty is definitive of being an animal (De\nSensu 1, 436b10\u201312); every animal has at least touch, whereas most\nhave the other sensory modalities as well (De Anima ii 2\n413b4\u20137). In broad terms at least, animals must have perception if they\nare to live. So, Aristotle supposes, there are defensible teleological\ngrounds for treating animals as essentially capable of perceiving\n(De Anima ii 3, 414b6\u20139, 434a30\u2013b4; De Sensu 1,\n436b16\u201317). If an animal is to grow to maturity and propagate, it must\nbe able to take in nourishment and to navigate its way through the\nworld. Perception serves these ends.\n\n\nThis much, however, does not explain how perception occurs.\nAristotle claims that perception is best understood on the model of\nhylomorphic change generally: just as a house changes from blue to\nwhite when acted upon by the agency of a painter applying paint, so\n\u201cperception comes about with <an organ\u2019s> being changed and\naffected \u2026 for it seems to be a kind of alteration\u201d\n(De Anima ii 5, 416b33\u201334). So in line with his general\naccount of alteration, Aristotle treats perception as a case of\ninteraction between two suitable agents: objects capable of acting and\ncapacities capable of being affected. That the agents and patients must\nboth be suitable is important, since we need to distinguish\nbetween two ways, e.g., an odor might affect something. By being placed\nin its vicinity, a clove of garlic might affect a block of tofu. The\ntofu might well come to take on the odor of the garlic. But we would\nnot want to say that the tofu perceives the garlic. By contrast, when\nan animal is affected by the same clove, it perceives the odor. Since\nthe garlic is the same in both cases, the difference in these cases\nmust reside in the character of the object affected. When animals\nreceive perceptual forms, perception results; when non-living entities\nare affected by what seem to be the same forms, only non-perceptual\nalteration occurs.\n\n\nIn both kinds of alterations, Aristotle is happy to speak of an\naffected thing as receiving the form of the agent which affects it and\nof the change consisting in the affected thing\u2019s \u201cbecoming\nlike\u201d the agent (De Anima ii 5, 418a3\u20136; ii 12,\n424a17\u201321). So there is in both cases a hylomorphic model of alteration\ninvolving enforming, that is, a model according to which\nchange is explained by the acquisition of a form by something capable\nof receiving it. Consequently, whatever is changed in a given way is\nnecessarily such that it is capable of being changed in that way. This\nis not the mere triviality that whatever becomes actually F\nmust already be possibly F. Instead, it is the recognition\nthat specific forms of change require suitable capacities in the\nchanging subjects, and that, consequently, analyses of specific forms\nof change will necessarily involve consideration of those capacities.\nNo marshmallow can receive the form of an actual automobile; and only\nentities capable of perceiving can receive the perceptible forms of\nobjects. This is Aristotle\u2019s meaning when he claims: \u201cthe\nperceptive faculty is in potentiality such as the object of perception\nalready is in actuality\u201d and that when something is affected by\nan object of perception, \u201cit is made like it and is such as that\nthing is\u201d (De Anima ii 5, 418a3\u20136).\n\n\nThis hylomorphic restriction on the suitability of subjects of\nchange has the effect of limiting cases of actual perception to those\ninstances of form-reception which involve living beings endowed with\nthe appropriate faculties. It does not, however, explain just what\nthose faculties are, nor even how they are \u201cmade like\u201d\ntheir objects of perception. Minimally, though, Aristotle claims that\nfor some subject S and some sense object O:\n\n\nS perceives O if and only if: (i)\nS has the capacity requisite for receiving O\u2019s\nsensible form; (ii) O acts upon that capacity by enforming it;\nand, as a result, (iii) S\u2019s relevant capacity becomes\nisomorphic with that form.\n\n\n\n\nEach of these clauses requires unpacking. The plausibility of\nAristotle\u2019s theory turns on their eventual explications. The first\nclause (i) is intended to distinguish the active capacities of animals\nfrom the merely passive capacities of lifeless material bodies,\nincluding the media through which sensible forms travel. (Just as we do\nnot want to say that the tofu in the refrigerator perceives the garlic\nnext to it, we do not want to say that air perceives the color blue\nwhen affected by the color of a car.) But it does not yet specify what\nis required for having the requisite active capacities. Also difficult\nis the notion of isomorphism appealed to in (iii). As stated, (iii)\ninvites, and has received, scrutiny. Interpretations range from\ntreating the form of isomorphism as direct and literal, so that, e.g.,\nthe eyes become speckled when viewing a robin\u2019s egg, to attenuated,\nwhere the isomorphism is more akin to that enjoyed between a house and\nits blue-print. Here especially the plausibility of Aristotle\u2019s\nhylomorphic analysis of perception hangs in the balance.\n\nFurther Discussion: Perception and Imagination\nSupplement: A Controversy Surrounding Aristotle\u2019s Conception of Perception\n\nSupplement: Imagination\n\n",
