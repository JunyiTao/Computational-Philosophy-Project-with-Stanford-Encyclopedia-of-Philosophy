    "main_text": "Epistemological and Metaphysical Issues || Dualism and Physicalism\n4.4 Dualism and Physicalism\n\n\nWhile epistemological and related methodological issues have been at\nthe forefront of discussions about animal consciousness, philosophical\nattention to consciousness in the analytic tradition over the last\nseveral decades has focused on metaphysical questions about the nature\nof phenomenal consciousness and its fit (or lack thereof) within a\nnaturalistic framework.\nOne might think that the question of what consciousness is\n(metaphysically) should be settled prior to tackling the Distribution\nQuestion \u2014 that ontology should drive the epistemology.\nHowever, the metaphysical questions that have occupied analytic\nphilosophers over the last few decades are largely orthogonal to the\ndistribution problem, which depends more on questions about the\nstructure and function of consciousness, discussed\nbelow.\n The traditional \u2018Mind Body Problem\u2019 concerns the\nmetaphysical status of mind in relation to the physical world (see SEP\narticle on dualism). Dualists argue that the\nmental and physical are fundamentally distinct, whereas physicalists\nhold that the mind is physical \u2014 and therefore not distinct,\ndespite supposed appearances to the contrary. A third alternative is\nidealism, the view that the physical world is actually mental (and\ntherefore that the two are not really distinct).\nDualistic theories of consciousness typically deny that it can be\naccounted for in the current terms of the natural\nsciences. Traditional dualists may argue that the reduction of\nconsciousness to physically describable mechanisms is impossible on\nany concept of the physical.  Others may hold that consciousness is an\nas-yet-undescribed fundamental constituent of the physical universe,\nnot reducible to any known physical principles. Such accounts of\nconsciousness (with the possible exception of those based in\nanthropocentric theology) provide no principled reasons, however, for\ndoubting that animals are conscious.\n Cartesian dualism is, of course, traditionally associated with the\nview that animals lack minds. Descartes\u2019 argument for this view was\nnot based, however, on any ontological principles, but upon what he\ntook to be the failure of animals to use language rationally, or to\nreason generally. On this basis he claimed that nothing in animal\nbehavior requires a non-mechanistic, mental explanation; hence he saw\nno reason to attribute possession of mind to animals.  In a sense,\ntherefore, the Cartesian argument for the human-uniqueness of\nconsciousness rests on the premise that material processes are\ninsufficient to account for human capacities for language,\nrationality, and self-awareness (i.e. the awareness of oneself as,\nputatively, an essentially thinking thing) \u2014 and hence a\nnon-material soul was posited to account for these phenomena.  Few\ntoday would hold that material processes are incapable of producing\ncomplex phenomena such as language and rationality, and indeed our\nunderstanding of \u2018the material\u2019 has changed dramatically\nsince Descartes\u2019 time. However, the subjective nature of consciousness\ncontinues to motivate some authors to argue that mental phenomena\ncannot be reduced to physical phenomena.\n\nThere is no conceptual reason why animal bodies are any less suitable\nvehicles for embodying a Cartesian soul, or any other of the\nputatively non-physical aspects of mind posited by proponents of\ndualism, than are human bodies. Hence, dualism does not preclude\nanimal minds as a matter of conceptual necessity. The distribution of\nconsciousness is a matter of empirical contingency on dualist theories\nas for physicalist theories. For some dualists, this may come down to\nwhether or not the animals in question possess specific cognitive\ncapacities, although others may argue that the non-physical nature of\nthe mental makes it difficult or impossible to investigate\nempirically. \n\n\nEarly physicalist accounts of consciousness explored the philosophical\nconsequences of identifying consciousness with unspecified physical or\nphysiological properties of neurons.  In this generic form, such\ntheories do not provide any particular obstacles to attributing\nconsciousness to animals, given that animals and humans are built upon\nthe same biological, chemical, and physical principles.  If it could\nbe determined that phenomenal consciousness was identical to (or at\nleast perfectly correlated with) some general property such as quantum\ncoherence in the microtubules of neurons, or brain waves of a specific\nfrequency, then settling the Distribution Question would be a\nstraightforward matter of establishing whether or not members of other\nspecies possess the specified properties. Searle (1998) too, although\nhe rejects the physicalist/dualist dialectic, also suggests that\nsettling the Distribution Question for hard cases like insects will\nbecome trivial once neuroscientists have carried out the non-trivial\ntask of determining the physiological basis of consciousness in\nanimals for which no reasonable doubt of their consciousness can be\nentertained (i.e., mammals). \n",
