    "main_text": "Relations in Medieval Philosophy || The Rejection of Polyadic Properties\n3.1 The Rejection of Polyadic Properties\n\n\nAlthough medieval philosophers generally regard Aristotle\u2019s\ncharacterization of relations as ontologically neutral, there is one\ntype of entity they standardly assume that relations could never\nbe\u2014namely, polyadic or many-place properties. For all their\ndifferences, the medievals tend to agree on the following point: polyadic properties\ncannot exist outside the mind.\n\n\nHistorians of philosophy sometimes speak as if the medievals could not even\nhave possessed the concept of a polyadic property\u2014as if\nconceiving of relations in this way only became possible in the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, with the advent of a formal logic\nof relations and multiple quantification (Cf. Weinberg 1965,\nesp. 61\u201363). But this is surely mistaken.  What recent advances in\nlogic have made possible is not the concept of a polyadic property,\nbut merely its representation within a formal system. Moreover, as we\nhave already seen, the notion of a polyadic predicate, from which\nour own concept of a polyadic property is derived, corresponds exactly\nto the medieval notion of a relative term.  And if that by itself\nweren\u2019t enough, there is the fact that medievals habitually speak of\nrelations in polyadic terms, explicitly comparing them to a road\nthat runs between two cities (via), or to a palisade running\nbetween two watchtowers (inter-vallum) (Cf. Albert\nthe Great, Liber de praedicamentis, 241a-241b; Aquinas\nSumma Theologiae I, q. 28, a. 4, obj. 5; and the texts of\nHarclay). Nor do they take themselves to be original in this\nregard. On the contrary, they take themselves merely to be following a\nsuggestion of Aristotle\u2019s in the Physics, which itself just\nappears to be part-and-parcel of the common sense conception of\nrelations (see Physics III, 202b11\u201315). As Peter Aurieol says\nat one point:\n\n\nIn the third book of his commentary on the Physics, comment\ntwenty, the Commentator [=Averroes] says that a relation is a\ndisposition (dispositio) existing between two\nthings.  But even apart from him it is clear that fatherhood is\nconceived of as if it were a kind of medium connecting a father with\nhis son. And the same is true of other relations.  (Scriptum super\nPrimum Sententiarum, fols. 318va-b. See Henninger\n1989, 153\u20134, n. 12, for the Latin text.)\n\n\n\n\nIn light of passages such as these, it is hard to take seriously the\nsuggestion that the medievals\u2014or indeed, any reflective\nbeings\u2014lack the concept of a polyadic property.\n\n\nIn addition to possessing this concept, there is evidence that at\nleast some medieval philosophers also posit the existence of polyadic\nproperties. In an important paper, Heine Hansen has argued that this\nis certainly true in the case of the thirteenth-century philosopher,\nNicholas of Paris. (See Hansen 2012.) And further research may well\nturn up other medieval philosophers holding the same view. At present,\nhowever, Nicholas appears to be something of an anomolous case.\n\n\nIndeed, despite possessing the concept of a polyadic property, medieval\nphilosophers are often explicit in their denial of anything in extramental\nreality exactly corresponding to such a concept. If we return to the passage just\nquoted from Auriol, we can see that, immediately after describing\nrelations as a sort of \u2018interval\u2019 (intervallum),\nhe proceeds to deny the existence of any such intervals in extramental\nreality.\n\n\nIt appears that a single thing, which must be imagined as some sort of\ninterval (intervallum) existing between two things, cannot\nexist in extramental reality, but only in the intellect. [This appears\nto be the case] not only because nature does not produce such\nintervals, but also because a medium or interval of this sort does not\nappear to be in either of the two things [it relates] as in a\nsubject, but rather between them where it is clear that there\nis nothing which can serve as its subject. (Scriptum super Primum\nSententiarum, fols. 318va-b.)\n\n\n\n\nAs this passage helps to make clear, the root of the standard medieval\nobjection to polyadic properties is ontological in nature, stemming\nfrom a particular conception of subjects and attributes. Following\nAristotle, the medievals divide extramental beings into\nsubstances and accidents, a division which they take to be both exclusive and\nexhaustive (since it is given in terms of a contradictory pair of\nproperties, namely, being in a subject vs. not being in a\nsubject) (Cf. Categories 1, 1a20\u20131b6). Now in the case\nof substances, it is perhaps clear that they are not polyadic in\nnature. But medievals typically think the same is also true of their accidents.\nThus, as Aquinas says at one point in his Sentences\ncommentary, in response to the question whether it is possible for\n\u201cnumerically one and the same relation\u201d to belong to\nbelong to two subjects at a time: \u201cNo, this cannot be, for one\naccident cannot belong to two subjects\u201d (In Sent. I,\nd. 27, q. 1, a. 1, ad 2).\n\n\nAlthough the medievals\u2019 objection to polyadic properties stems in large\npart from ontological considerations, they also offer\nother reasons for rejecting them. Sometimes these involve\nconsiderations of theoretical parsimony. As Ockham is so fond of\nsaying: \u201cIt is futile to do with more [entities] what can be\ndone with\n fewer\u201d.[10]\n Other times, however, these reasons involve phenomenological or\nepistemological considerations. Albert the Great, for example, objects\nto polyadic properties on the grounds that we are not presented in\nexperience with anything but individuals and their so-called absolute\nattributes\u2014that is, substances and their quantities and\n qualities.[11]\n",
