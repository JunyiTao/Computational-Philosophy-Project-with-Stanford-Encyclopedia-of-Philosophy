    "main_text": "The Trolley Problem and the Doing/Allowing Distinction\n3. The Trolley Problem and the Doing/Allowing Distinction\n\nAt this point, it is worth discussing the relationship between the\ndoing/allowing distinction and the famous Trolley Problem. The Trolley\nProblem dates back to Philippa Foot\u2019s (1978) discussion of a\npair of examples: In the first case, a judge must choose between\nframing and killing an innocent man and allowing five innocents to be\nkilled in a riot. In the second, a trolley driver must choose between\nturning a trolley so that it runs over an innocent man attached to a\ntrack and allowing the trolley to run over and kill five innocent\npeople. Foot, claimed that it was wrong to kill in the first case, but\nnot wrong in the second. Foot noted that such cases might motivate\nsomeone to accept the Doctrine of Double Effect, which distinguishes\nbetween harm that is strictly intended and harm that is merely\nforeseen. However, Foot argues that the cases can be explained by the\ndistinction between doing and allowing harm: the judge must choose\nbetween killing one and merely allowing five to die, while the trolley\ndriver must choose between killing one and killing five. Judith Jarvis\nThomson (1986) modified the case so that it was a bystander, not the\ndriver, who had to make the choice. The difference was important,\nsince the bystander is clearly choosing between killing and letting\ndie and yet it still seems permissible to turn the trolley. This\nundermines Foot\u2019s claim that the difference between doing and\nallowing explains our intuitions about these cases. So what made the\ndifference? A considerable amount of ink has been spilled attempting\nto answer this question.\n\n22 years after putting forward the bystander version of the trolley\ncase, Thomson (2008) changed her mind and argued that the consensus\nthat it is permissible for the bystander to turn the trolley was\nmistaken. She offers the reader a third option, of turning the trolley\nonto and killing oneself. Obviously, few of us would take that option.\nIf so, she argues, we are not entitled to turn the trolley onto a\nstranger. Doing so would be like stealing someone\u2019s wallet to\ngive to charity. Thomson argues that it is still wrong to turn the\ntrolley even without the option of turning it on oneself. Fitzpatrick\n(2009) has responded to Thomson by casting doubt on the analogy\nbetween stealing money to give to charity and turning the trolley on a\nstranger rather than oneself. We know that stealing is wrong except in\nexceptional cases \u2014 and the fact that the agent would prefer not\nto donate her own money doesn\u2019t make it an exceptional case. The\nTrolley Case is exceptional, which is precisely why it has generated\nso much discussion. Fitzpatrick argues that it must be permissible to\nsacrifice others when we would not sacrifice ourselves: morality\ncannot demand such extreme self-sacrifice but nonetheless the reasons\nto minimise damage remain\n compelling.[7]\n\n\nThe bystander trolley case might seem to undermine the claim that the\ndoing/allowing distinction is morally relevant. After all, it seems as\nif it is permissible for the bystander to do harm to one person rather\nthan allow harm to five others. Derek Parfit (2017) uses the bystander\ntrolley case in this way, arguing that considering such cases shows\nthat the fact that a threat is heading towards one group of people\nrather than another gives no reason not to redirect the threat.\nHowever, as Kamm (2020) points out, even if the fact that a threat is\nheading to one group rather than another is not morally relevant in\nitself, it might supervene on other morally relevant features. Kamm\nasks us to consider a version of the trolley case where there are five\npeople on each track. The bystander must choose between killing five\nand letting five die. If not harming had no priority over not aiding,\nthen it would seem the bystander should be morally indifferent between\nthese two options \u2013 but it is clear that they are morally\nrequired not to turn the trolley from five to five. As Kamm concludes,\nit seems that, if turning the trolley is permissible, it is not\npermissible because there are no differences between turning the\ntrolley and not turning the trolley. Instead, it is permissible\ndespite these differences. \n\nAlthough the Trolley Problem is often associated with the\ndoing/allowing distinction, the two should be kept separate. First, we\nmust settle whether the doing/allowing distinction is morally\nsignificant. If it can be shown that the doing/allowing distinction is\nmorally significant, the Trolley Problem should be understood as a\nfurther challenge. To respond to this challenge one must either (a)\nappeal to some additional distinction to explain why it is permissible\nfor the bystander to turn the trolley towards five to save one, even\nthough it is not normally permissible to kill one to save five or (b)\nshow that we should abandon the intuition that it is permissible for\nthe bystander to turn the trolley. \n\nLet\u2019s turn to some candidate accounts of the doing/allowing\ndistinction, and where appropriate, the moral significance or\ninsignificance of each account. In both doing and allowing, an agent\nis responsible for or relevant to a bad upshot\u2014such as a death\nor injury\u2014in the sense that she could have prevented it. The\ncontrast is most naturally picked out by the terms \u2018doing\u2019\nand \u2018allowing\u2019, or \u2018making\u2019 and\n\u2018allowing\u2019. We will in general use the former but due to\noccasional awkwardnesses in practice, we will sometimes use the terms\n\u201cpositively relevant to an upshot\u201d and \u201cnegatively\nrelevant to an upshot\u201d for cases of \u201cdoing\u201d and\n\u201callowing\u201d,\n respectively.[8]\n",
