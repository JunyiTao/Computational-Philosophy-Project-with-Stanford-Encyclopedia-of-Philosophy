    "main_text": "Tarski\u2019s theory of truth || Recursive definition of truth\n2.3 Recursive definition of truth\n\nTarski does not merely propose a condition of adequacy for theories of\ntruth, he also shows how to meet it. One of his insights is that if\nthe language \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) displays the right structure, then\ntruth for \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) can be defined recursively. For instance,\nlet us suppose that \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is a simple formal language,\ncontaining two atomic sentences \u2018snow is white\u2019 and\n\u2018grass is green\u2019, and the sentential connectives \\(\\vee\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\).\n\nIn spite of its simplicity, \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) contains infinitely\nmany distinct sentences. But truth can be defined for all of them by\nrecursion.\n\nBase clauses:\n\n\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 is true if and only if snow is\nwhite.\n\u2018Grass is green\u2019 is true if and only if grass is\ngreen.\n\nRecursion clauses. For any sentences \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\):\n\n\n \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\vee \\psi \\urcorner\\) is true if\nand only if \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is true or\n\\(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urcorner\\) is true.\n \\(\\ulcorner \\neg \\phi \\urcorner\\) is true if and\nonly if it is not the case that \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is true.\n\n\n\nThis theory satisfies Convention T.\n",
