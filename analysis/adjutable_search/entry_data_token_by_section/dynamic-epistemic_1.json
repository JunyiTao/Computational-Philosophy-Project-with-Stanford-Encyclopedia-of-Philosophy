    "main_text": "Public communication || Public Announcement Logic\n2.1 Public Announcement Logic\n\nPublic Announcement Logic (PAL) is the modal logic study of knowledge,\nbelief, and public communication. PAL (pronounced \u201cpal\u201d)\nis used to reason about knowledge and belief and the changes brought\nabout in knowledge and belief as per the occurrence of completely\ntrustworthy, truthful announcements. PAL\u2019s most common\nmotivational examples include the Muddy Children Puzzle and\nthe Sum and Product Puzzle (see, e.g., Plaza 1989, 2007). The\nCheryl\u2019s Birthday problem, which became a sensation on\nthe Internet in April 2015, can also be addressed using PAL. Here we\npresent a version of the Cheryl\u2019s Birthday problem due to Chang\n(2015, 15 April) and a three-child version of the Muddy Children\nPuzzle (Fagin et al. 1995). Instead of presenting the traditional Sum\nand Product Puzzle (see Plaza (1989, 2007) for details), we present\nour own simplification that we call the Sum and Least Common\nMultiple Problem. \n\n\nCheryl\u2019s Birthday (version of Chang (2015, 15\nApril)). Albert and Bernard just met Cheryl.\n\u201cWhen\u2019s your birthday?\u201d Albert asked Cheryl.\n\nCheryl thought a second and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell\nyou, but I\u2019ll give you some clues\u201d. She wrote down a list\nof 10 dates:\n\nMay 15, May 16, May 19\nJune 17, June 18\nJuly 14, July 16\nAugust 14, August 15, August 17\n\n\n\u201cMy birthday is one of these\u201d, she said.\n\nThen Cheryl whispered in Albert\u2019s ear the month\u2014and only\nthe month\u2014of her birthday. To Bernard, she whispered the day,\nand only the day.\n\n\u201cCan you figure it out now?\u201d she asked Albert.\n\n\nAlbert: I don\u2019t know when your birthday is, but I know\nBernard doesn\u2019t know either.\nBernard: I didn\u2019t know originally, but now I do.\nAlbert: Well, now I know too!\n\n\n\nWhen is Cheryl\u2019s birthday?\n\n\n\nThe Muddy Children Puzzle. Three children are playing\nin the mud. Father calls the children to the house, arranging them in\na semicircle so that each child can clearly see every other child.\n\u201cAt least one of you has mud on your forehead\u201d, says\nFather. The children look around, each examining every other\nchild\u2019s forehead. Of course, no child can examine his or her\nown. Father continues, \u201cIf you know whether your forehead is\ndirty, then step forward now\u201d. No child steps forward. Father\nrepeats himself a second time, \u201cIf you know whether your\nforehead is dirty, then step forward now\u201d. Some but not all of\nthe children step forward. Father repeats himself a third time,\n\u201cIf you know whether your forehead is dirty, then step forward\nnow\u201d. All of the remaining children step forward. How many\nchildren have muddy foreheads?\n\n\n\nThe Sum and Least Common Multiple Puzzle. Referee\nreminds Mr. S and Mr. L that the least common multiple\n(\u201c\\(\\text{lcm}\\)\u201d) of two positive integers x and\ny is the smallest positive integer that is divisible without\nany remainder by both x and y (e.g.,\n\\(\\text{lcm}(3,6)=6\\) and \\(\\text{lcm}(5,7)=35\\)). Referee then says,\n\n\n\nAmong the integers ranging from \\(2\\) to \\(7\\), including \\(2\\) and\n\\(7\\) themselves, I will choose two different numbers. I will whisper\nthe sum to Mr. S and the least common multiple to Mr. L. \n\n\nReferee then does as promised. The following dialogue then takes\nplace:\n\n\nMr. S: I know that you don\u2019t know the numbers.\nMr. L: Ah, but now I do know them.\nMr. S: And so do I!\n\n\n\nWhat are the numbers?\n\n\nThe Sum and Product Puzzle is like the Sum and Least Common Multiple\nPuzzle except that the allowable integers are taken in the range\n\\(2,\\dots,100\\) (inclusive), Mr. L is told the product of the two\nnumbers (instead of their least common multiple), and the dialogue is\naltered slightly (L: \u201cI don\u2019t know the numbers\u201d, S:\n\u201cI knew you didn\u2019t know them\u201d, L: \u201cAh, but now\nI do know them\u201d, S: \u201cAnd now so do I!\u201d). These\nchanges result in a substantially more difficult problem. See Plaza\n(1989, 2007) for details. \n\nThe reader is advised to try solving the puzzles himself or herself\nand to read more about PAL below before looking at the PAL-based\nsolutions found in a\n Appendix B.\n Later, after the requisite basics of PAL have been presented, the\nauthors will again point the reader to this appendix. \n\nThere are many variations of these puzzles, some of which motivate\nlogics that can handle more than just public communication.\nRestricting attention to the variations above, we note that a formal\nlogic for reasoning about these puzzles must be able to represent\nvarious agents\u2019 knowledge along with changes in this knowledge\nthat are brought about as a result of public announcements. One\nimportant thing to note is that the announcements in the puzzles are\nall truthful and completely trustworthy: so that we\ncan solve the puzzles, we tacitly assume (among other things) that\neverything that is announced is in fact true and that all agents\naccept the content of a public announcement without question. These\nassumptions are of course unrealistic in many everyday situations,\nand, to be sure, there are more sophisticated Dynamic Epistemic Logics\nthat can address more complicated and nuanced attitudes agents may\nhave with respect to the information they receive. Nevertheless, in an\nappropriately restricted situation, Public Announcement Logic provides\na basic framework for reasoning about truthful, completely trustworthy\npublic announcements. \n\nGiven a nonempty set \\(\\sP\\) of propositional letters and a finite\nnonempty set \\(\\sA\\) of agents, the basic modal language \\eqref{ML} is\ndefined as follows:  \n\n\\[\\begin{gather*}\nF  \\ccoloneqq p \\mid F \\wedge F \\mid \\neg F \\mid [a]F \\\\\n \\small p \\in \\sP,\\; a \\in \\sA\n\\taglabel{ML}\n\\end{gather*}\\]\n\n\nFormulas \\([a]F\\) are assigned a reading that is doxastic\n(\u201cagent a believes F\u201d) or epistemic\n(\u201cagent a knows F\u201d), with the particular\nreading depending on the application one has in mind. In this article\nwe will use both readings interchangeably, choosing whichever is more\nconvenient in a given context. In the language \\eqref{ML}, Boolean\nconnectives other than negation \\(\\lnot\\) and conjunction \\(\\land\\)\nare taken as abbreviations in terms of negation in conjunction as is\nfamiliar from any elementary Logic textbook. See\n Appendix A\n for further details on \\eqref{ML} and its Kripke semantics. \n\nThe language \\(\\eqref{PAL}\\) of Public Announcement Logic extends the\nbasic modal language \\eqref{ML} by adding formulas \\([F!]G\\) to\nexpress that \u201cafter the public announcement of F, formula\nG is true\u201d:  \n\n\\[\\begin{gather*}\nF \\ccoloneqq p \\mid F \\wedge F \\mid \\neg F \\mid [a]F \\mid [F!]F \\\\\n \\small p \\in \\sP,\\; a \\in \\sA\n\\taglabel{PAL}\n\\end{gather*}\\]\n\n\nSemantically, the formula \\([F!]G\\) is interpreted in a Kripke model\nas follows: to say that \\([F!]G\\) is true means that, whenever\nF is true, G is true after we eliminate all not-F\npossibilities (and all arrows to and from these possibilities). This\nmakes sense: since the public announcement of F is completely\ntrustworthy, all agents respond by collectively eliminating all\nnon-F possibilities from consideration. So to see what obtains\nafter a public announcement of F occurs, we eliminate the\nnon-F worlds and then see what is true in the resulting\nsituation. Formally, \\(\\eqref{PAL}\\)-formulas are evaluated as an\nextension of the binary truth relation \\(\\models\\) between pointed\nKripke models and \\eqref{ML}-formulas (defined in\n Appendix A)\n as follows: given a Kripke model \\(M=(W,R,V)\\) and a world \\(w\\in\nW\\), \n\n\\(M,w\\models p\\) holds if and only if \\(w\\in V(p)\\);\n\\(M,w\\models F\\land G\\) holds if and only if both \\(M,w\\models F\\)\nand \\(M,w\\models G\\);\n\\(M,w\\models\\lnot F\\) holds if and only if \\(M,w\\not\\models\nF\\);\n\\(M,w\\models[a]F\\) holds if and only if \\(M,v\\models F\\) for each\nv satisfying \\(wR_av\\); and\n\\(M,w \\models [F!]G\\) holds if and only if we have that \\(M,w\n\\not\\models F\\) or that \\(M[F!],w \\models G\\), where the model\n\n\\[\nM[F!] = (W[F!],R[F!],V[F!])\n\\]\n\n is defined by:\n\n\n \\(W[F!] \\coloneqq \\{ v \\in W \\mid M,v \\models F\\}\\) \u2014\nretain only the worlds where F is true, \n \\(xR[F!]_ay\\) if and only if \\(xR_ay\\) \u2014 leave arrows\nbetween remaining worlds unchanged, and \n \\(v \\in V[F!](p)\\) if an only if \\(v \\in V(p)\\) \u2014 leave the\nvaluation the same at remaining worlds. \n \n\n\nNote that the formula \\([F!]G\\) is vacuously true if F is\nfalse: the announcement of a false formula is inconsistent with our\nassumption of truthful announcements, and hence every formula follows\nafter a falsehood is announced (ex falso quodlibet). It is\nworth remarking that the dual announcement operator \\(\\may{F!}\\)\ndefined by  \n\n\\[ \\may{F!}G \\coloneqq \\neg[F!]\\neg G \\] \n\n\ngives the formula \\(\\may{F!} G\\) the following meaning: F is\ntrue and, after F is announced, G is also true. In\nparticular, we observe that the announcement formula \\(\\may{F!} G\\) is\nfalse whenever F is false. \n\nOften one wishes to restrict attention to a class of Kripke models\nwhose relations \\(R_a\\) satisfy certain desirable properties such as\nreflexivity, transitivity, Euclideanness, or seriality. Reflexivity\ntells us that agent knowledge is truthful, transitivity tells us that\nagents know what they know, Euclideanness tells us that agents know\nwhat they do not know, and seriality tells us that agent knowledge is\nconsistent. (A belief reading is also possible.) In order to study\npublic announcements over such classes, we must be certain that the\npublic announcement of a formula F does not transform a given\nKripke model M into a new model \\(M[F!]\\) that falls outside of\nthe class. The following theorem indicates when it is that a given\nclass of Kripke models is \u201cclosed\u201d under public\nannouncements (meaning a public announcement performed on a model in\nthe class always yields another model in the class). \n\nSee\n Appendix C\n for the definition of reflexivity, transitivity, Euclideanness,\nseriality, and other important relational properties. \n\n\nPublic Announcement Closure Theorem. Let\n\\(M=(W,R,V)\\) be a Kripke model and F be a formula true at at\nleast one world in W.\n\n If \\(R_a\\) is reflexive, then so is \\(R[F!]_a\\). \n If \\(R_a\\) is transitive, then so is \\(R[F!]_a\\). \n If \\(R_a\\) is Euclidean, then so is \\(R[F!]_a\\). \n If \\(R_a\\) is serial and Euclidean, then so is\n\\(R[F\\land\\bigwedge_{x\\in\\sA}\\may{x} F!]_a\\). \n\n\n\nThe Public Announcement Closure Theorem tells us that reflexivity,\ntransitivity, and Euclideanness are always closed under the public\nannouncement operation. Seriality is in general not; however, if\nseriality comes with Euclideanness, then public announcements of\nformulas of the form \\(F\\land\\bigwedge_{x\\in\\sA}\\may{x} F\\) (read,\n\u201cF is true and consistent with each agent\u2019s\nknowledge\u201d) preserve both seriality and Euclideanness.\nTherefore, if we wish to study classes of models that are serial,\nthen, to make use of the above theorem, we will need to further\nrestrict to models that are both serial and Euclidean and we will need\nto restrict the language of public announcements so that all\nannouncement formulas have this form. (One could also restrict to\nanother form, so long as public announcements of this form preserve\nseriality over some class \\(\\sC\\) of serial models.) Restricting the\nlanguage \\eqref{PAL} by requiring that public announcements have the\nform \\(F\\land\\bigwedge_{x\\in\\sA}\\may{x} F\\) leads to the language\n\\eqref{sPAL} of serial Public Announcement Logic, which we\nmay use when interested in serial and Euclidean Kripke models. \n\n\\[\\begin{gather*}\nF  \\ccoloneqq p \\mid F \\wedge F \\mid \\neg F \\mid [a]F \\mid [F\\land\\bigwedge_{x\\in\\sA}\\may{x} F!]F\\\\\n\\small p \\in \\sP,\\; a \\in \\sA\n\\taglabel{sPAL}\n\\end{gather*}\\]\n\n\nGiven a class of Kripke models satisfying certain properties and a\nmodal logic \\(\\L\\) in the language \\eqref{ML} that can reason about\nthat class, we would like to construct a Public Announcement Logic\nwhose soundness and completeness are straightforwardly proved. To do\nthis, we would like to know in advance that \\(\\L\\) is sound and\ncomplete with respect to the class of models in question, that some\npublic announcement extension \\(\\LPAL\\) of the language \\eqref{ML}\n(e.g., the language \\eqref{sPAL} or maybe even \\eqref{PAL} itself)\nwill include announcements that do not spoil closure, and that there\nis an easy way for us to determine the truth of \\(\\LPAL\\)-formulas by\nlooking only the underlying modal language \\eqref{ML}. This way, we\ncan \u201creduce\u201d completeness of the public announcement\ntheory to the completeness of the basic modal theory \\(\\L\\). We call\nsuch theories for which this is possible PAL-friendly. \n\n\nPAL-friendly theory. To say that a logic \\(\\L\\) is\nPAL-friendly means we have the following:\n\n \\(\\L\\) is a normal multi-modal logic in the language \\eqref{ML}\n(i.e., with modals \\([a]\\) for each agent \\(a\\in\\sA\\)), \n there is a class of Kripke models \\(\\sC\\) such that \\(\\L\\) is\nsound and complete with respect to the collection of pointed Kripke\nmodels based on models in \\(\\sC\\), and \n there is a language \\(\\LPAL\\) (the \u201cannouncement extension\nof \\(\\L\\)\u201d) obtained from \\eqref{PAL} by restricting the form of\npublic announcement modals \\([F!]\\) such that \\(\\sC\\) is closed under\npublic announcements of this form (i.e., performing a public\nannouncement of this form on a model in \\(\\sC\\) having at least one\nworld at which the announced formula is true yields another model in\n\\(\\sC\\)). \n\n\n\nSee\n Appendix D\n for the exact meaning of the first component of a PAL-friendly\ntheory. \n\nExamples of PAL-friendly theories include the common \u201clogic of\nbelief\u201d (multi-modal \\(\\mathsf{KD45}\\)), the common \u201clogic\nof knowledge\u201d (multi-modal \\(\\mathsf{S5}\\)), multi-modal\n\\(\\mathsf{K}\\), multi-modal \\(\\mathsf{T}\\), multi-modal\n\\(\\mathsf{S4}\\), and certain logics that mix modal operators of the\npreviously mentioned types (e.g., \\(\\mathsf{S5}\\) for \\([a]\\) and\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\) for all other agent modal operators \\([b]\\)). Fixing a\nPAL-friendly theory \\(\\L\\), we easily obtain an axiomatic theory of\npublic announcement logic based on \\(\\L\\) as follows. \n\n\nThe axiomatic theory \\(\\PAL\\).\n\n Axiom schemes and rules for the PAL-friendly theory \\(\\L\\) \n Reduction axioms (all in the language \\(\\LPAL\\)):\n\n\n \\( [F!]p \\leftrightarrow (F\\to p) \\) for letters \\(p\\in\\sP\\)\n\n\u201cAfter a false announcement, every letter holds\u2014a\ncontradiction. After a true announcement, letters retain their truth\nvalues.\u201d \n \\([F!](G\\land H)\\leftrightarrow([F!]G\\land[F!]H)\\)\n\n\u201cA conjunction is true after an announcement iff each conjunct\nis.\u201d \n \\([F]\\lnot G\\leftrightarrow(F\\to\\lnot[F!]G)\\)\n\n\u201cG is false after an announcement iff the announcement,\nwhenever truthful, does not make G true.\u201d \n \\([F!][a]G \\leftrightarrow (F\\to[a][F!]G)\\)\n\n\u201ca knows G after an announcement iff the\nannouncement, whenever truthful, is known by a to make G\ntrue.\u201d \n \n Announcement Necessitation Rule: from G, infer \\([F!]G\\)\nwhenever the latter is in \\(\\LPAL\\).\n\n\u201cA validity holds after any announcement.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe reduction axioms characterize truth of an announcement formula\n\\([F!]G\\) in terms of the truth of other announcement formulas\n\\([F!]H\\) whose post-announcement formula H is less complex\nthan the original post-announcement formula G. In the case\nwhere G is just a propositional letter p, Reduction\nAxiom 1 says that the truth of \\([F!]p\\) can be reduced to a formula\nnot containing any announcements of F. So we see that the\nreduction axioms \u201creduce\u201d statements of truth of\ncomplicated announcements to statements of truth of simpler and\nsimpler announcements until the mention of announcements is not\nnecessary. For example, writing the reduction axiom used in a\nparenthetical subscript, we have the following sequence of provable\nequivalences:  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n& [[b]p!](p\\land[a]p) \\\\\n\\leftrightarrow_{(2)} & [[b]p!]p\\land[[b]p!][a]p\\\\\n\\leftrightarrow_{(1)} & ([b]p\\to p)\\land[[b]p!][a]p\\\\\n\\leftrightarrow_{(4)} & ([b]p\\to p)\\land([b]p\\to[a][[b]p!]p)\\\\\n\\leftrightarrow_{(1)} & ([b]p\\to p)\\land([b]p\\to[a]([b]p\\to p))\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nNotice that the last formula does not contain public announcements.\nHence we see that the reduction axioms allow us to express the truth\nof the announcement-containing formula \\([[b]p!](p\\land[a]p)\\) in\nterms of a provably equivalent announcement-free formula. This is true\nin general. \n\n\n\\(\\PAL\\) Reduction Theorem. Given a PAL-friendly\ntheory \\(\\L\\), every F in the language \\(\\LPAL\\) of Public\nAnnouncement Logic (without common knowledge) is \\(\\PAL\\)-provably\nequivalent to a formula \\(F^\\circ\\) coming from the announcement-free\nfragment of \\(\\LPAL\\).\n\n\nThe Reduction Theorem makes proving completeness of the axiomatic\ntheory with respect to the appropriate class of pointed Kripke models\neasy: since every \\(\\LPAL\\)-formula can all be expressed using a\nprovably equivalent announcement-free \\eqref{ML}-formula, completeness\nof the theory \\(\\PAL\\) follows by the Reduction Theorem, the soundness\nof \\(\\PAL\\), and the known completeness of the underlying modal theory\n\\(\\L\\). \n\n\n\\(\\PAL\\) Soundness and Completeness. \\(\\PAL\\) is\nsound and complete with respect to the collection \\(\\sC_*\\) of pointed\nKripke models for which the underlying PAL-friendly theory \\(\\L\\) is\nsound and complete. That is, for each \\(\\LPAL\\)-formula F, we\nhave that \\(\\PAL\\vdash F\\) if and only if \\(\\sC_*\\models F\\).\n\n\nOne interesting \\(\\PAL\\)-derivable scheme (available if allowed by the\nlanguage \\(\\LPAL\\)) is the following:  \n\n\\[\n[F!][G!]H \\leftrightarrow [F\\land[F!]G!]H\n\\]\n\n\nThis says that two consecutive announcements can be combined into a\nsingle announcement: to announce that F is true and then to\nannounce that G is true will have the same result as announcing\nthe single statement that \u201cF is true and, after F\nis announced, G is true\u201d. \n\nWe conclude with a few complexity results for Public Announcement\nLogic. \n\n\nPAL Complexity. Let \\(\\sC\\) be the class of all\nKripke models. Let \\(\\sC_{\\mathsf{S5}}\\) be the class of Kripke models\nsuch that each binary accessibility relation is reflexive, transitive,\nand symmetric.\n\n The satisfiability problem for single-agent \\eqref{PAL} over\n\\(\\sC_{\\mathsf{S5}}\\) is NP-complete (Lutz 2006). \nThe satisfiability problem for multi-agent \\eqref{PAL} over\n\\(\\sC_{\\mathsf{S5}}\\) is PSPACE-complete (Lutz 2006). \nThe model checking problem for \\eqref{PAL} over \\(\\sC\\) is in P\n(Kooi and van Benthem 2004). \n\n\n\nOne thing to note about the theory \\(\\PAL\\) as presented above is that\nit is parameterized on a PAL-friendly logic \\(\\L\\). Therefore,\n\u201cPublic Announcement Logic\u201d as an area of study in fact\nencompasses a wide-ranging family individual Public Announcement\nLogics, one for each instance of \\(\\L\\). Unless otherwise noted, the\nresults and concepts we present apply to all logics within this\nfamily. \n\nIn\n Appendix E,\n we detail further aspects of Public Announcement Logic: schematic\nvalidity, expressivity and succinctness, Gerbrandy\u2013Groeneveld\nannouncements, consistency-preserving announcements and Arrow Update\nLogic, and quantification over public announcements in Arbitrary\nPublic Announcement Logic. \n\nWhile iterated public announcements seem like a natural operation to\nconsider (motivated by, e.g., the Muddy Children Puzzle), Miller and\nMoss (2005) showed that a logic of such a language cannot be\nrecursively axiomatized. \n\nFinally, PAL-based solutions to the Cheryl\u2019s Birthday, Muddy\nChildren, and Sum and Least Common Multiple Puzzles are presented in\n Appendix B.\n \n",
