    "main_text": "Scope of LOTH\n2. Scope of LOTH\n\nRTT concerns propositional attitudes and the mental processes in which\nthey figure, such as deductive inference, reasoning, decision-making,\nand planning. It does not address perception, motor control,\nimagination, dreaming, pattern recognition, linguistic processing, or\nany other mental activity distinct from high-level cognition. Hence\nthe emphasis upon a language of thought: a system of mental\nrepresentations that underlie thinking, as opposed to perceiving,\nimagining, etc. Nevertheless, talk about a mental language generalizes\nnaturally from high-level cognition to other mental phenomena.\n\nPerception is a good example. The perceptual system\ntransforms proximal sensory stimulations (e.g., retinal stimulations)\ninto perceptual estimates of environmental conditions (e.g., estimates\nof shapes, sizes, colors, locations, etc.). Helmholtz (1867 [1925])\nproposed that the transition from proximal sensory input to perceptual\nestimates features an unconscious inference, similar in key\nrespects to high-level conscious inference yet inaccessible to\nconsciousness. Helmholtz\u2019s proposal is foundational to\ncontemporary perceptual psychology, which constructs detailed\nmathematical models of unconscious perceptual inference (Knill &\nRichards 1996; Rescorla 2015). Fodor (1975: 44\u201355) argues that\nthis scientific research program presupposes mental representations.\nThe representations participate in unconscious inferences or\ninference-like transitions executed by the perceptual\n system.[5]\n\nNavigation is another good example. Tolman (1948)\nhypothesized that rats navigate using cognitive maps: mental\nrepresentations that represent the layout of the spatial environment.\nThe cognitive map hypothesis, advanced during the heyday of\nbehaviorism, initially encountered great scorn. It remained a fringe\nposition well into the 1970s, long after the demise of behaviorism.\nEventually, mounting behavioral and neurophysiological evidence won it\nmany converts (Gallistel 1990; Gallistel & Matzel 2013; Jacobs\n& Menzel 2014; O\u2019Keefe & Nadel 1978; Weiner et al.\n2011). Although a few researchers remain skeptical (Mackintosh 20002),\nthere is now a broad consensus that mammals (and possibly even some\ninsects) navigate using mental representations of spatial layout.\nRescorla (2017b) summarizes the case for cognitive maps and reviews\nsome of their core properties.\n\nTo what extent should we expect perceptual representations and\ncognitive maps to resemble the mental representations that figure in\nhigh-level human thought? It is generally agreed that all these mental\nrepresentations have compositional structure. For example, the\nperceptual system can bind together a representation of shape and a\nrepresentation of size to form a complex representation that an object\nhas a certain shape and size; the representational import of the\ncomplex representation depends in a systematic way upon the\nrepresentational import of the component representations. On the other\nhand, it is not clear that perceptual representations have\nlogical structure (Block 2023: 182\u2013190; Burge 2022:\n190\u2013201), including even predicative structure (Burge 2010:\n540\u2013544; Burge 2022: 44\u201345: Fodor 2008: 169\u2013195).\nNor is it evident that cognitive maps contain logical connectives or\npredicates (Rescorla 2009a, 2009b). Perceptual processing and\nnon-human navigation certainly do not seem to instantiate mental\nprocesses that would exploit putative logical structure. In\nparticular, they do not seem to instantiate deductive inference.\n\nThese observations provide ammunition for pluralism about\nrepresentational format. Pluralists can posit one system of\ncompositionally structured mental representations for perception,\nanother for navigation, another for high-level cognition, and so on.\nDifferent representational systems potentially feature different\ncompositional mechanisms. As indicated in\n section 1.3,\n pluralism figures prominently in contemporary cognitive science.\nPluralists face some pressing questions. Which compositional\nmechanisms figure in which psychological domains? Which\nrepresentational formats support which mental operations? How do\ndifferent representational formats interface with each other? Further\nresearch bridging philosophy and cognitive science is needed to\naddress such questions.\n",
