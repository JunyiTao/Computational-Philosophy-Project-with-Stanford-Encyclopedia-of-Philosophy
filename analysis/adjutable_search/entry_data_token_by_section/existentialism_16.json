    "main_text": "Ethics\n6. Ethics\n\n\nExistentialist ethics generally begins with the idea that there is\nno external moral order or table of values that exists a priori.\n\u201cIt must be understood,\u201d as Beauvoir writes in The\nEthics of Ambiguity, \u201cthat the passion in which man has\nacquiesced finds no external justification. No outside appeal, no\nobjective necessity permits of its being called useful.\u201d But this\ndoes not mean that the existentialists are promoting a form of moral\nnihilism. Beauvoir admits it is true that the human being \u201chas no\nreason to will itself. But this does not mean that it cannot\njustify itself, that it cannot give itself reasons for being\nthat it does not have.\u201d It is human existence itself\n\u201cwhich makes values spring up in the world on the basis of which\nit will be able to judge the enterprise in which it will be\nengaged.\u201d (1947 [1948, 12,\n 15]).[12]\nThere is, then, a coherent account\nof ethical responsibility grounded in freedom, not as a theoretical\nabstraction but as a concrete expression of transcendence, and the\nobligation to help others realize their own freedom so that I can\nrealize mine. When I acknowledge that freedom is my essence, I must\nalso acknowledge that it is the essence of others and work, to the best\nof my ability, to help them realize it. My freedom, then, is not\nfree-floating; it is invariably bound up in the freedom of others. As\nSartre puts it: \u201cWe want freedom for freedom\u2019s sake and in\nevery particular circumstance. And in wanting freedom we discover that\nit depends entirely on the freedom of others, and that freedom of\nothers depends on ours [\u2026] I am obliged to want others to have\nfreedom at the same time that I want my own freedom\u201d (1945\n[2001, 306]). \n",
