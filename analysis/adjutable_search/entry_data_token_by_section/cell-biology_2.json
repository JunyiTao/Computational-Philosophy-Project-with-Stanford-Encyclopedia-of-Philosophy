Vitalists and Holists\n\nAlmost all of those pursuing the various metaphors discussed in the\nprevious section embraced a view that had its origins in Descartes,\nwho maintained both non-living and living systems (with the exception\nof the human mind) operated like machines. But a significant number of\nresearchers rejected this perspective and maintained that living\norganisms, including cells, are fundamentally different from ordinary\nphysical, mechanical systems. They argued that in one way or another\ncomposition from material components is insufficient to account for\nthe phenomena associated with cells. We begin with these opponents of\nmechanistic conceptions of cells and then examine how those advocating\nmechanistic approaches responded.\n\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth century the opponents of mechanism\nwere typically referred to as vitalists. The various\nvitalists all rejected mechanism, taken as the view that organisms are\ncomposed of physical parts that operate in accord with the same\nprinciples as processes in the non-living world. Their positive views\nvaried. Some vitalists adopted a position much like that of substance\ndualists with respect to the mind, arguing that some non-material\ncomponent\u2014a vital force (vis vitalis)\u2014operates in\nliving beings and accounts for their distinctive activities. Others\navoided positing an extra component but maintained that different laws\napply in living organisms than in non-living systems (for discussions\nof these different versions of vitalism, see contributions in\nNormandin & Wolfe 2013). Regardless of how they expressed their\npositive views, vitalists commonly pointed to activities of living\norganisms that they claimed could not be accounted for in the same\nmanner as physical processes. This is well illustrated in Bichat\n(1805), who focused first on the apparent lack of determinism in the\nbehavior of biological organisms and second on the fact that organisms\nseemed to oppose physical processes that threatened to destroy them\n(in his words, they resist death). As noted above, Schwann\nand Pasteur both claimed that living yeast are needed to produce\nfermentation. While for Schwann this only entailed that fermentation\ndepended on the specific combination of materials found in cells, for\nvitalists it entailed that living cells perform activities that could\nnot be performed by the collection of component molecules. Bichat and\nPasteur, as well as other prominent vitalists such as M\u00fcller\n(1837\u20131840), embraced empirical and experimental research, but\ndrew limits with respect to what could be explained by appeal to the\nmaterial components of an organism alone.\n\nIn many cases, mechanists did not explicitly respond to vitalists but\nsimply moved forward with their research. Bernard (1865), was an\nexception. He addressed Bichat\u2019s challenges by introducing a\ndistinction between an organism\u2019s internal and external\nenvironment. Mechanistic operations within organisms are carried out\nin the internal environment and jointly serve to maintain that\nenvironment in a constant state. Because mechanistic operations\nrespond to conditions in the internal environment, they appear\nindeterminate when considered only in relation to external stimuli.\nMoreover, because these mechanisms work to maintain a constant\ninternal environment, one could explain the ability of organisms to\nresist physical processes that might otherwise destroy them (for\ndiscussions of Bernard see Holmes 1974 and LaFollette & Shanks\n1994). Bernard\u2019s approach was the foundation for Cannon\u2019s\nlater well-known work on homeostasis (1929).\n\nBy the beginning of the twentieth century few biologists investigating\ncells (Driesch, 1914,\nbeing a notable exception) espoused vital forces and vitalism per\nse ceased to be regarded as a tenable position. But many\nbiologists were still concerned to account for differences between\nliving cells and ordinary material systems. A prominent position\nadopted by many investigators (Haldane 1929, 1931; Lillie 1934;\nNeedham 1936; Russell 1945, 1930; Von Bertalanffy 1952; Weiss 1963;\nWoodger 1929) was holism, sometimes referred to as\norganicism. (See Nicholson and Gawne 2015, for a discussion\nof how the organicists differentiated their position from both\nvitalism and mechanism.) Holists accepted that living systems were\nbuilt out of material parts. They insisted, however, that the\nactivities performed by components of living systems depended not just\non those components and their composition but on their organization.\nAccordingly, one cannot just add together the activities of the\ncomponents to account for the whole (\u201cthe whole is not just the\nsum of its parts\u201d). The organized whole in part determines how\nthe parts behave. This attitude is manifest, for example, in J. S.\nHaldane\u2019s opposition to investigating the origins of life from\nnon-living matter: \u201cThere is and can be no origin of life out of\nmechanical conditions. Such an origin is inconceivable\u201d (Haldane\n1930: 12).\n\nThe organization of cellular systems plays a central role in the\ndialectic between mechanistic biologists and holists. Holists often\nconstrue mechanistic biologists as downplaying the importance of\norganization, but many mechanistic biologists deny this. Bernard had\nemphasized the role of organization in allowing components to maintain\nthe constancy of the internal environment and those seeking to explain\nhomeostasis appealed to feedback loops. Recognizing that mechanistic\naccounts are not limited to a simple, additive view of organization,\nJ. S. Haldane\u2019s son, J. B. S. Haldane, abandoned his\nfather\u2019s commitment to holism and embraced a mechanistic\nframework that emphasized how biological components are affected by\nbeing incorporated within organized systems. In making this break with\nhis father he was heavily influenced by working with the biochemist\nHopkins (1913), who likewise made organization central to his accounts\nof biochemical processes. Accordingly, J. B. S. Haldane became one of\nthe pioneers in formulating biological inquiry into the origins of\nlife while still insisting that complex organization figured centrally\nin activities of living organisms (Martin 2010).\n\nPhilosophers and scientists often invoke the word emergent\nfor phenomena that are different from the phenomena generated by their\ncomponents (see the entry on\n emergent properties).\n Sometimes emergent phenomena are viewed as incapable of being\nexplained in terms of their constituents. In the context of\ncharacterizing systems biological accounts of cell phenomena, Boogerd\net al. (2005) develop an account according to which emergent phenomena\nare ones that are fully explicable in terms of how their constituents\nbehave in the organized system, but not in terms of how they behave in\nsimpler (less complexly organized) systems. This recognizes that many\ncellular constituents behave differently when incorporated into\nparticular systems in which they receive distinctive inputs. For other\nrecent treatments of emergence and its applications to cell biology,\nsee (Hooker 2011a; S.\nMitchell 2012; Mossio, Bich, & Moreno 2013; Winning & Bechtel\n2019).\n\nThe desire to understand how the organization in cells and\nmulticellular organisms differs from that found in most naturally\noccurring systems or human-made artifacts motivated a body of research\nin theoretical biology in the 1970s and 1980s. Among the most\nprominent contributors to theoretical biology were Pattee (many of his\nmost important papers have been collected in Pattee 2012), Rosen\n(1985, 1991), Polanyi (1968), and Waddington (1961). Philosophy of\nbiology, as it developed as a specialty in philosophy of science in\nthe 1970s and 1980s, largely ignored this tradition. Today however a\nnumber of philosophers concerned with cell biology are drawing upon\nits insights. Here we focus on one key conceptual tool theoretical\nbiologists provide for understanding the distinctive activities of\nliving systems such as cells: constraints. The notion of constraint is\ndrawn from classical mechanics, where constraints serve to constitute\nmacro-scale objects from their micro-scale particles. Constraints thus\naccount for why macro-scale objects exhibit different properties than\ntheir constituents. Constraints are not explained by laws but rather\nserve as boundary conditions that must be ascertained empirically.\nAccordingly, to the degree constraints explain biological activities\nof cells, these activities cannot be reduced, in the sense of being\nderived from the principles of chemistry or physics. Instead,\nresearchers must, on the basis of empirical inquiry, identify the\nconstraints actually realized in living cells.\n\nThe importance of constraints for understanding cellular and other\nbiological phenomena has been developed recently by Hooker (2011b, 2013) and Moreno and Mossio\n(2015). Hooker makes clear that, although the term constraint\nsuggests limitations, constraints also extend possibilities\u2014to\noffer a cellular example, microtubules that run from the cell center\nto the periphery restrict the movement of the kinesin and dynein\nmotors that move on them but also provide a possibility for transport\nof organelles to distant locations. Moreno and Mossio in particular\ndevelop a perspective that links the focus on constraints to the idea\nthat living cells are autopoietic. Drawing upon Maturana and\nVarela\u2019s (1980) conception of living systems as autopoietic\nmachines\u2014machines that provide a network of production that\nenables the construction of the living system\u2014Moreno and Mossio\nadd a focus on the thermodynamic requirements of cells. Cells, as\nhighly organized systems, are far from equilibrium and require a\ncontinual source of free energy to carry out the operations required\nto synthesize new components and resist the tendency towards\nequilibrium. What constraints do in organisms, on their account, is\ndirect flows of free energy to perform the work of building,\nrepairing, and reproducing the organism.\n\nSome constraints are flexible, and these make possible an important\nfeature of living systems\u2014the ability of organisms to control\nproduction mechanisms (such as those involve in fermentation or muscle\ncontraction) through the actions of \ncontrol mechanisms. On Pattee\u2019s account, control mechanisms\nchange the flexible constraints in production mechanisms in\nlight of information that is procured by making measurements. Negative\nfeedback control mechanisms, such as thermostats, are simple examples:\nthe thermostat makes a measurement of a variable (temperature in the\nroom) that is affected by the operation of the production\nmechanisms\u2014the furnace\u2014and based on the measurement\nexecutes action on the constraints in the furnace mechanism. Examples\nof feedback control mechanisms are widespread in cells. Some of the\nbest-known examples are the lac operon (Jacob & Monod\n1961) and feedback control of glycolysis by ATP (Ghosh & Chance\n1964). The measurements used by control systems need not be restricted\nto states affected by the activity of the production mechanism; they\ncan also measure states in the organism or states in its environment.\nUsing such measurements, production mechanisms can be controlled so as\nto operate only in particular circumstances, enabling the organism,\nfor example, to navigate to a food source or avoid a predator as\nneeded.\n\nMoreno and Mossio (2015) offer an account in which appropriately\norganized productive and control mechanisms enable cells, and by\nextension multi-cellular organisms, to achieve what they refer to as\nbiological autonomy: \n\n\na distinctive regime of causation, able not only of producing and\nmaintaining the parts that contribute to the functioning of the system\nas an integrated, operational, and topologically distinct whole but\nalso able to promote the conditions of its own existence through its\ninteraction with the environment. (2015: xvi\u2013xvii) \n\n\nNote that mechanisms, on this view, are contained within cells and\nthat it is cells, not mechanisms that are autonomous. What becomes\ncrucial for understanding the autonomy of cells is the organization of\ncontrol mechanisms that orchestrate the activities of various\nproductive mechanisms so as to maintain the cell (or the multicellular\norganism). One notable feature of this focus on the organization\nneeded to maintain autonomy is that it is compatible with the more\ntraditional philosophical accounts of mechanism (discussed in\n section 5)\n but emphasizes a feature not prominent in them\u2014that production\nmechanisms are subject to control mechanisms. To understand the\nbehavior of cellular mechanisms, researchers must not only look inside\nmechanisms to their organized parts and operations but outside to how\nthey are situated in cells and organisms in such a way that they can\nbe controlled by other mechanisms (Winning & Bechtel 2018; Bechtel\nin press). Such an ontological framework for understanding cells (as\nwell as multicellular organisms) integrates insights from traditional\nmechanists in biology and their vitalist/organicist/holist critics,\ncapturing what is distinctive of living organisms within a framework\nthat accepts them as consisting of mechanisms, but mechanisms\norganized in appropriate ways.\n",
