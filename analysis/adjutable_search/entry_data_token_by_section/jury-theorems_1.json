    "main_text": "Introduction || A broad notion of decision\n1.2 A broad notion of decision\n\nJury theorems address collective \u201cdecisions\u201d in a broad\nsense. Decisions could, for instance, stand for collective\nbeliefs or collective actions or choices. In the\nlegal arena, jury verdicts represent beliefs (about guilt or\ninnocence), whereas court rulings represent actions (of convicting or\nacquitting defendants). In the political arena, parliamentary\ndecisions and referendum decisions usually represent choices.\nDepending on its mandate, an ethical or scientific commission either\nproduces collective beliefs (which serve as advice), or performs\nactions, e.g., sets a budget or institutes ethical standards.\n\nBut there is one key condition: decisions must be\ncorrectness-apt, i.e., be either factually correct or\nincorrect (or, more generally, of some correctness degree). Which\nfacts determine correctness? Belief-type decisions are correct if the\nbelief has true content. Action-type decisions are correct depending\non some state; e.g., court rulings are correct depending on past\nactions of the defendant.\n\nCollective beliefs are examples of collective attitudes.\nOther possible collective attitudes are collective values, desires,\npreferences, or intentions. They too can be formed through\naggregation: think of preference aggregation rules generating\ncollective preferences. Any collective attitude whose possession can\nbe factually correct or incorrect is potentially an object of jury\ntheorems. Whether attitudes can be correct is, of course, more\ncontroversial for non-belief attitudes (cf.\n Section 4.1).\n\nIn sum, jury theorems address collective decisions of any\ncorrectness-apt kind, including collective actions, beliefs, and other\nattitudes.\n",
