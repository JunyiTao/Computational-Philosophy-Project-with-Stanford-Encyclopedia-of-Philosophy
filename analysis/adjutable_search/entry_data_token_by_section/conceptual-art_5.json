The Philosophy of Conceptual Art \u2013 What is it?\n\nOn the whole, the philosophical concerns raised by conceptual art can\nbe divided into two main categories. First, there are specific\nquestions to do with conceptual art itself, and the claims which\nunderpin the project that drives it. Philosophical investigations\nmight thus be called for not only in relation to the internal\nconsistency and coherence of the project and its set goals, but also\nwith regards to the particular tenets outlined above. For example,\nwhat does it mean to say that every single thing, person or event is a\npossible candidate for an artistic medium and does that suggestion not\nrender the category of art, as we know it, redundant?\n\nSecond, conceptual art poses philosophical problems from a wider\nperspective, in so far as one might expect philosophy to provide us\nwith unitary accounts of the nature of art, the role of the artist,\nand artistic experience. In many important respects, conceptual art\nsits very uncomfortably with other, often more traditional artforms\nand artworks, and this tension highlights a pressing issue for anyone\ninterested in the possibility of a universal theory of art. For if\nthere is to be one rule for conceptual art and another for all other\nkinds of art, are there still good grounds for thinking of conceptual\nart as a kind of art? Moreover, could not every particular kind of\nartform or artwork demand a separate theory of art, artist and\nartistic experience?\n\nIf we are to sidestep such an intrinsic division between conceptual\nart on the one hand, and other kinds of art on the other, then\ntheories concerned mainly with art that is not conceptual will have to\nmake many significant concessions in order to incorporate the\nproblematic case that conceptual artworks present. At the very least,\na compromise will have to be reached concerning what we mean by the\nterm \u2018artwork\u2019.\n\nOne of the over-riding concerns that beset the philosophy of\nconceptual art is thus whether and, if so, why one should actively\npursue unified accounts in the philosophy of art. Whether one comes\nout of that investigation embracing a broader \u2013 albeit perhaps\nvaguer \u2013 set of concepts and tools than one started off with, or\nwhether one considers oneself forced to abandon any hope of anything\nbut very specific theories of art, artist, and artistic experience,\nconceptual art obliges us to think about where we stand on these\nissues.\n\nPhilosophizing about conceptual art is, then, not merely\nphilosophizing about one specific artform. It is philosophizing about\nthe most revisionary kind of art, one that sees its own task as being\nprofoundly philosophical in nature. Let us now turn to five more\nspecific philosophical themes that conceptual art urges us to\nconsider.\n",
