    "main_text": "Method\n2. Method\n\nHeraclitus made every effort to break out of the mold of contemporary\nthought. Although he was influenced in a number of ways by the thought\nand language of his predecessors, including the epic poets Homer and\nHesiod, the poet and philosopher Xenophanes, the historian and\nantiquarian Hecataeus, the religious guru Pythagoras, the sage Bias of\nPriene, the poet Archilochus, and the Milesian philosophers, he\ncriticized most of them either explicitly or implicitly, and struck\nout on his own path. He rejected polumathi\u00ea or\ninformation-gathering on the grounds that it \u201cdoes not teach\nunderstanding\u201d\n (B40).[1]\n He treated the epic poets as fools and called Pythagoras a fraud.\n\nIn his fragments Heraclitus does not explicitly criticize the\nMilesians, and it is likely that he saw them as the most progressive\nof previous thinkers. He does tacitly criticize Anaximander for not\nappreciating the role of injustice in the world (B80), while he might\nhave expressed some admiration for Thales (B38). His views can be seen\nto embody structural criticisms of Milesian principles, but even in\ncorrecting the Milesians he built on their foundations. \n\nHeraclitus\u2019 most fundamental departure from previous philosophy\nlies in his emphasis on human affairs. While he continues many of the\nphysical and cosmological theories of his predecessors, he shifts his\nfocus from the cosmic to the human realm. We might well think of him\nas the first humanist, were it not for the fact that he does not seem\nto like humanity very well. From the outset he makes it clear that\nmost people are too stupid to understand his theory. He may be most\nconcerned with the human relevance of philosophic theories, but he is\nan elitist like Plato, who thinks that only select readers are capable\nof benefitting from his teachings. And perhaps for this reason he,\nlike Plato, does not teach his philosophical principles directly, but\ncouches them in a literary form that distances the author from the\nreader. In any case he seems to regard himself not as the author of a\nphilosophy so much as the spokesman for an independent truth:\n\nHaving harkened not to me but to the Word (Logos) it is wise\nto agree that all things are one. (B50)\n\n\nHeraclitus stresses that the message is not his own invention, but a\ntimeless truth available to any who attend to the way the world itself\nis. \u201cAlthough this Word is common,\u201d he warns, \u201cthe\nmany live as if they had a private understanding\u201d (B2). The Word\n(account, message) exists apart from Heraclitus\u2019 teaching, but\nhe tries to convey that message to his audience.\n\nThe blindness of humans is one of Heraclitus\u2019 main themes. He\nannounces it at the beginning of his book:\n\nOf this Word\u2019s being forever do men prove to be uncomprehending,\nboth before they hear and once they have heard it. For although all\nthings happen according to this Word, they are like the unexperienced\nexperiencing words and deeds such as I explain when I distinguish each\nthing according to its nature and show how it is. Other men are\nunaware of what they do when they are awake just as they are forgetful\nof what they do when they are asleep. (B1)\n\n\nHe begins by warning his readers that most of them will not understand\nhis message. He promises to \u201cdistinguish each thing according to\nits nature and show how it is,\u201d a claim similar to the\nMilesians\u2019. Yet like sleepers his readers will not understand\nthe world around them. As this implies, in his book Heraclitus does\nhave some things to say about the natural world, but much more to say\nabout the human condition.\n\nNo less important than Heraclitus\u2019 message is the form in which\nhe imparts it to his audience. Aristotle noticed that even in the\nfirst sentence of B1, quoted above, the force of the word\n\u2018forever\u2019 was unclear: did it go with the preceding or the\nsubsequent words, with \u2018being\u2019 or \u2018prove\u2019\n(Rhetoric 1407b11\u201318)? He regarded the ambiguity as a\nweakness in Heraclitus\u2019 communication. But if we attend to\nHeraclitus\u2019 language we see that syntactical ambiguity is more\nthan an accident: it is a common technique he uses to enrich his words\nand to infuse them with a unique verbal complexity like that of\npoetry. Charles Kahn (1979: 89) identifies two general traits of\nHeraclitus\u2019 style, linguistic density and resonance. The former\nis his ability to pack multiple meanings into a single word or phrase,\nthe latter his ability to use one expression to evoke another. To take\na simple example:\n\nmoroi mezones mezonas moiras lanchanousi.\n\nDeaths that are greater greater portions gain. (B25)\n\n\nHeraclitus uses alliteration (four m-words in a row) and chiasmus (an\nABBA pattern) to link death and reward. The latter appears as a mirror\nimage of the former, and in sound and sense they fuse together.\nAnother fragment consists of three words in Greek:\n\n\u00eathos anthr\u00f4p\u00f4i daim\u00f4n.\n\nThe character of man is his guardian spirit. (B119)\n\n\nThe second word, in the dative case \u201cto\u201d or\n\u201cfor\u201d man, stands between the names of two very unlike\nobjects, \u2018character\u2019 and \u2018deity.\u2019\nGrammatically, it can attach to either indifferently, and seems\nintended to be heard with both, so that it counts twice. Because of\nits double role, the word forms a kind of syntactic glue between the\notherwise diverse subjects, joining them together in a unity.\nTraditionally having a good or a bad guardian spirit constitutes\none\u2019s \u201cluck\u201d\u2013one is eudaim\u00f4n or\ndusdaim\u00f4n, fortunate or wretched, at the mercy of\none\u2019s divine overseer. But Heraclitus turns one\u2019s luck\ninto a function of one\u2019s character, one\u2019s ethical stance,\nby making \u201cman\u201d the link.\n\nUltimately, Heraclitus loads his words with layers of meaning and\ncomplexities that are to be discovered in insights and solved like\nriddles. As he implies in the second sentence of his introduction, B1,\nhis logoi are designed to be experienced, not just\nunderstood, and only those who experience them in their richness will\ngrasp his message.\n",
