    "main_text": "Empirical challenges and the role of consciousness || Automaticity and dual-system theory\n4.4 Automaticity and dual-system theory\nOne strand of empirical research that is relevant to questions\nconcerning the role of consciousness in agency is the work on\nautomaticity; in particular, the research on automatic goal\npursuit. It has been shown, for instance, that the goal to perform a\ncertain task accurately can be primed, so that the agent pursues the\ngoal without any awareness of doing so (Bargh et al. 2001). There is\na large body of research on this, and it has been suggested that this\nresearch shows that most of our actions are executed\nautomatically and without conscious control (Bargh and Chartrand\n1999, Custers and Aarts 2010).[22] This claim is less radical than the\nclaims put forward by Libet (1999) and Wegner (2002), as it concerns\nonly the extent or scope of conscious control. Further, this appears\nto be much less challenging once it is noted that the great majority\nof automatic actions are sub-routines that are in the service of\nhigher goals and long-term intentions. Consider, for instance, all\nthe sub-routines that one performs while driving a car. The claim\nthat such actions are performed automatically and without conscious\ncontrol can be reconciled with our commonsense conception of agency\nand it can be accommodated by the standard theory, provided that\nconscious intentions and plans can recruit the relevant routines\nautomatically, either by generating the relevant motor intentions, or\nby activating the relevant motor schemata. (For more on this see\nPacherie 2008; Adams 2010; Clarke 2010b.)\nAnother relevant strand of research is the work on dual-process (or\ndual-system) theories of decision-making. According to such models,\nthere are two distinct types of mental processes (or systems) that\nunderlie decision-making and agency: one is typically characterized as\nautomatic, effortless, and heuristics-based, and the other as\nconscious, deliberate, and rule-based. Dual-process models have been\ndeployed widely and successfully in many areas of research (for\noverviews see Sloman 1996; Evans 2008; for critical reviews see Osman\n2004; Keren and Schul 2009). In philosophy, it is commonly assumed,\nexplicitly or implicitly, that there is one mechanism (or\nfaculty) of practical reason that underlies practical reasoning and\nreason-based agency. This appears to be incompatible with the\ndual-process framework. What complicates this issue, though, is that\nthere is no consensus on the details of the dual-process model. There\nis, for instance, no commonly accepted view on how the two processes\n(or systems) interact. Conscious and deliberate processes may have a\ntop-down influence on automatic processes; the two processes may\ninteract with each other; they may interfere with each other in some\ncases; there may be cases in which processing switches from one to the\nother; and so on. Not all of those possibilities are obviously\nincompatible with the assumption that there is one mechanism (or\nfaculty) of practical reason. Further research is needed in order to\ninvestigate whether the two types of processes are in the relevant\nrespects independent or whether they can be construed as interacting\nparts of one mechanism of decision-making. For a discussion of whether\nthe dual-system framework is compatible with the philosophical\nstandard theory of action see Schlosser\n2019.[23]\n",
