    "main_text": "Ethics, Language, and Methods || Patterns of Analysis\n4.1 Patterns of Analysis\n\nStevenson aims to clarify ethical language by using\n\u201ctools\u201d of analysis. One tool that Stevenson will\nnot use to clarify ethical language is the tool of\ndefinition, at least in the sense of \u2018definition\u2019 that\nimplies \u201cfinding synonym for synonym,\u201d since he thinks\nthat ethical terms, due to their emotive meanings, are indefinable in\nthis sense (1944, 82). Rather, Stevenson\u2019s analytic tool of choice is\na set of models. The models highlight the respective dispositional\nelements (i.e. elements of meaning) of ethical language that, via its\nuse, are to varying degrees in linguistic play (1944, chapters II, IV,\nand IX; see esp. 82\u201383; for discussion, see also Urmson 1968,\nchapters 4 and 6).\n\nTwo such models, labeled \u2018(P1)\u2019 and\n\u2018(P4)\u2019 below, receive a great deal of\nStevenson\u2019s attention, because they paradigmatically exemplify for the\nsentence \u2018This is good\u2019 what Stevenson calls respectively\nhis \u201cFirst Pattern\u201d and \u201cSecond Pattern\u201d of\nanalysis (1944, chapters IV and IX). These patterns and, hence,\n(P1) and (P4) differ most importantly in\ndescriptive richness and emotive force. (P1)\u2019s descriptive\ncontent is scant, conveying only information about the speaker\u2019s\nattitude and, therefore, conveying only somewhat more information than\nis conveyed by (P1)\u2019s relatively strong emotive element;\ntherefore, (P1) well-models those uses of an ethical\nsentence at which front and center is a speaker\u2019s attitude.\n(P4)\u2019s descriptive content conveys more complex, precise\ninformation about the qualities of which the speaker approves and\nmerely characterizes \u2018This is good\u2019 as conveying emotive\nforce; therefore, (P4) well-models those uses of an ethical\nsentence at which front and center are a speaker\u2019s moral\nstandards.\n\nAs models, (P1) and (P4) have different\nstrengths and weaknesses, and while discussing them Stevenson suggests\nor implies several other models: (P2a)-(P3c).\nLike (P1), (P2a)-(P2c) exemplify\nStevenson\u2019s First Pattern of Analysis, and, like (P4),\n(P3a)-(P3c) exemplify Stevenson\u2019s Second Pattern\nof Analysis. Notice that each subset of models, and each model within\neach subset, is listed roughly in order of increasing descriptive\nrichness and decreasing emotive force.\n\nDiscussion begins with (P1), returning later to\n(P0a)\u2013(P0d).\n\n\u2018This is good\u2019 means:\n\n(P0a)\nApprove of this!\n(P0b)\nLet\u2019s all approve of this!\n(P0c)\nHooray for this!\n(P0d)\nHooray for this for being X, Y, and\nZ!\n\n\n(P1)\nI approve of this; do so as well.\n(P2a)\nI approve of this; let\u2019s all do so!\n(P2b)\nI approve of this; hooray for this!\n(P2c)\nI approve of this; how I wish we would all do so!\n\n\n(P3a)\nThis is X; hooray for this!\n(P3b)\nThis is X; hooray for things that are X!\n(P3c)\nThis is X, Y, and Z; hooray for\nthings that are X, Y, and Z!\n\n\n(P4)\nThis is X, Y, and Z [\u201cexcept\nthat \u2018good\u2019 has as well a laudatory emotive meaning which\npermits it to express the speaker\u2019s approval and tends to evoke the\napproval of the hearer\u201d]\n\n\nStevenson devotes a great deal of space in Ethics and\nLanguage discussing the various features and implications of\n(P1). However, despite its usefulness, (P1) is\nnot be taken as some sort of \u201cofficial\u201d model of ethical\nsentences. Five of (P1)\u2019s misleading features, acknowledged\nby Stevenson himself, are as follows:\n\nProblem 1:\nThe imperative is \u201ctoo blunt an instrument\u201d (1944,\n32), evoking attitudes in a overly aggressive, crude way. Moral\nclaims, according to Stevenson, lead rather than command\npeople to alter their attitudes and, so, the force of the judgment\n\u2018This is good\u2019 \u201chas been poorly approximated\u201d\nby (P1) (1944, 32\u201333).\nProblem 2:\nThe imperative suggests that the purpose of moral deliberation and\ndiscussion is to convert others. Since the use of a second-person\nimperative implies a position of authority over one\u2019s audience, this\nmodel gives the impression that the speaker or writer \u201cwishes\nonly to propagate his preconceived aims, without reconsidering\nthem\u201d (1944, 32). However, most moral claims are often\noccasioned not by a desire for \u201cconquest,\u201d but rather by a\ndesire for mutual understanding (1944, 32).\nProblem 3:\nThe declarative suggests that the descriptive element is often\nquite narrow and perhaps quite precise, when in point of fact it is\noften quite broad or complex and quite vague (1944, 33\u201334 and\n206\u2013213).\nProblem 4:\nThe declarative fails to model the possibility of disagreement in\nbelief, which intuitively is a part of many moral disagreements.\nSuppose, for example, that Smith declares that complimenting others is\ngood, while Jones declares that complimenting others is bad, and that\ntheir disagreement is grounded in the conflict between Smith\u2019s belief\nthat complimenting others generally leads to a healthy degree of\nself-esteem and Jones\u2019s belief that complimenting others too often\nleads to excessive pride. According to (P1), the\ndescriptive element of Smith\u2019s utterance is rendered \u2018I approve\nof complimenting others\u2019, while Jones\u2019s utterance is rendered\n\u2018I disapprove of complimenting others\u2019 (1944, 22). But\nhere, Smith and Jones disagree in belief not at all.\nProblem 5:\nThe declarative implies, implausibly, that the full justification\nof a moral claim always requires the provision of reasons for\nbelieving that a speaker approves or disapproves of that to\nwhich she refers (1963b, 210\u2013212).\n\n\nModels (P2a)\u2013(P2c) rectify Problems 1 and\n2 to some degree. They lessen the blunt force and authoritativeness of\nthe second-person imperative by using a more interpersonally agreeable\nfirst-person plural imperative, exclamative, and optative\nrespectively. (P2a), because it retains an imperative,\nmodels better than (P2b) and (P2c) the\ndispositions of moral sentences to evoke an audience\u2019s attitudes or\nbehaviors. The latter two, containing instead an exclamative and\noptative respectively, model better than (P2a) the\ndispositions of moral sentences to express a speaker\u2019s attitudes.\n\nModels (P3a)\u2013(P3c) rectify Problems 3-5 to\nsome degree. Each suggests that the descriptive element in ethical\nsentences is more complex and perhaps more vague, suggesting as they\ndo a more general description of an action, person, policy, etc. as\nexemplifying certain characteristics or properties, rather than the\nnarrower and more precise description of a speaker as exemplifying a\nspecific attitude. Thus, each allows that moral disagreement may be\ngrounded in disagreement in belief\u2014e.g., Smith and Jones can use\n\u2018complimenting others is good\u2019 and \u2018complimenting\nothers is not good\u2019 respectively as a means of disagreeing in\nbelief about whether complimenting others exemplifies property X (or Y\nor Z)\u2014and, thereby, eliminates the implication that fully\njustifying a moral claim requires providing reasons for\nbelieving that a speaker has the particular attitude she is\ndescribed as having.\n\nStevenson\u2019s (P4), has a descriptive element that is more\nprecise than (P3a)\u2013(P3b). It also removes\neven a model of the emotive element, leaving instead just a\ncharacterization to the effect that some emotive element is present.\nThus, unlike (P0a)\u2013(P1), which place the\ndispositional relations between ethical terms and\nattitudes\u2014i.e., emotive meaning\u2014front and center,\n(P4) instead places front and center the dispositional\nrelations between ethical terms and beliefs\u2014i.e., descriptive\nmeaning. (P4) thus captures the passive dispositions of\nethical terms to be used as a result of a speaker or writer\u2019s more\nspecific cognitive states about the properties or characteristics of\nan action, person, etc., and the terms\u2019 active dispositions to\ncause such cognitive states in an audience. Perhaps the more\ndescriptive \u201cthick\u201d ethical terms, such as\n\u2018cruel\u2019, \u2018kind\u2019, or \u2018courageous\u2019\nprovide the best examples of terms that possess such dispositions.\n\nReturning to (P0a)\u2013(P0d), these rectify to\nsome degree an additional problem, one that encumbers all of\n(P1)\u2013(P4).\n\nProblem 6:\nIt is often simply too difficult to determine whether the\ndescriptive meaning of ethical language is strictly\ndesignated or merely suggested (1944, 85\u201387).\n\n\nThe distinction between \u2018strictly designates\u2019 and\n\u2018suggests\u2019 is most plausibly understood as invoking the\ndistinction between semantics and pragmatics, or the distinction\nbetween that which is conveyed as a matter of convention or as a\nmatter of conversational dynamics:\n\n\nThe distinction which the question presupposes, that between what\n\u2018good\u2019 means and what it suggests, is\noften beyond the precision of ordinary language. It is a distinction\nbetween descriptive dispositions of the term, one of which is\npreserved by linguistic rules and the other is not. In the rigorous\ndiscourse of science or mathematics, which avails itself of\ninterrelated sets of definitions or formal postulates, the distinction\nis readily made. In the rough contexts of daily life, however, a great\nmany rules are not stipulated, being imperfectly evident from people\u2019s\nlinguistic habits; and even those rules which are occasionally\nstipulated are not constantly followed. Certain rules, of course,\nare always observed; for \u2018good\u2019, whatever else,\nis \u2018not bad\u2019 and \u2018not indifferent\u2019. But many\nother rules remain as mere possibilities. If such a rule is\nspecifically called to a person\u2019s attention he may accept\nit\u2014though usually only temporarily, for a given purpose. Not\nuntil a great many rules are permanently settled, though, do we get\nbeyond the undecided region that separates descriptive meaning from\nsuggestiveness. When rules are in the course of becoming\ngenerally accepted, there is a long period over which we may either\naccept or reject them without violence to conventional language. Our\ndecision may settle the matter for our own usage, and determine what\nis afterward to be called the term\u2019s descriptive meaning, and\nwhat is to be called its suggestiveness; but our finished product is\nby no means the same as the raw material. (1944, 86; see also 1948a,\n154\u2013158; 1963b, 208\u2013210)\n\n\nThus, Stevenson\u2019s distinction between \u2018strictly\ndesignates\u2019 and \u2018suggests\u2019 is plausibly captured by\nthe later Gricean distinction between that which is \u201csaid\u201d\nor \u201cconventionally implicated\u201d on the one hand, and that\nwhich is \u201cconversationally implicated\u201d on the other (Grice\n1975). Models (P0a)\u2013(P0d), then, are\nuseful for reminding us that the \u201cstrict\u201d meaning of\nethical terms may include only its emotive meaning; if so,\nhowever, its descriptive meaning is strongly suggested and, thus,\nalways remains in linguistic play (1944, 95\u201396).\n",
