    "main_text": "Aesthetics\n7. Reception and Influence\n\nAlthough the French post-structuralists who succeeded Weil did not\nengage extensively with her thought, her concepts carry a legacy\nthrough her contemporaries domestically and her heirs internationally\n(see Rozelle-Stone 2017). In regard to her generation of French\nthinkers, the influence of \u201cattention\u201d can be seen in the\nwritings of Maurice Blanchot; her Platonic sense of good, order, and\nclarity was taken up\u2014and rejected\u2014by both Georges Bataille\nand Emmanuel Levinas. Following Weil\u2019s generation, in his\nyounger years Jacques Derrida took interest in her mysticism and,\nspecifically, her purifying atheism, only to leave her behind almost\nentirely in his later references (Baring 2011). It is possible that\nWeil\u2019s limited influence on post-structuralists is derived not\nonly from the fact that she was not influenced by Nietzsche and\nHeidegger to the extent of the four aforementioned French thinkers,\nbut also, quite simply, because she did not survive World War II and\nhence did not write thereafter. It is also important to note that\nthroughout her life, Weil\u2019s position as a woman philosopher\ncontributed to ad hominem attacks against her person, not her\nthought; she was often perceived as \u201cpsychologically cold\u201d\nas opposed to being engaged in \u201can ethical project with\ndifferent assumptions\u201d (Nelson 2017: 9).\n\nAcross Europe and more recently, Weil\u2019s \u201cnegative\npolitics\u201d\u2014that is, turning away from institutions and\nideology and toward religious reflection\u2014, in conjunction with\nMichel Foucault\u2019s concept of biopolitics, has been taken up by\nthe political philosophies of Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito\n(Ricciardi 2009). In doing so, Agamben (who wrote his dissertation on\nWeil\u2019s political thought and critique of personhood, ideas of\nwhich went on to shape Homo Sacer [see Agamben 2017]) and\nEsposito rely on Weil\u2019s concepts of decreation, impersonality,\nand force. Beyond the Continental scene, her Christian\nPlatonism\u2014especially her concepts of the good, justice, void,\nand attention\u2014influenced Iris Murdoch\u2019s emphasis on the\ngood, metaphysics, and morality, and was thereby part of a recent\nrevival in virtue ethics (Crisp & Slote 1997). In addition, many\nhave noted the \u201cspiritual kinship\u201d that is apparent between the\nreligious and ethical philosophies of Weil and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\nFor example, the view that belief in God is not a matter of evidence,\nlogic, or proof is shared by these thinkers (Von der Ruhr 2006). The\nlegacy of Weil\u2019s writings on affliction and beauty in relation\nto justice is also felt in Elaine Scarry\u2019s writings on\naesthetics (Scarry 1999). T. S. Eliot, who wrote the introduction to\nThe Need for Roots, cites Weil as an inspiration of his\nliterature, as do W. H. Auden, Czeslaw Milosz, Seamus Heaney, Flannery\nO\u2019Connor, Susan Sontag, and Anne Carson.\n\nThe Anglo-American secondary literature on Weil has emphasized her\nconcept of supernatural justice, including the philosophical tensions\nthat inform her materialism and mysticism (Winch 1989; Dietz 1988;\nBell 1993, 1998; Rhees 2000). Additional considerations treat her\nChristian Platonism (Springsted 1983; Doering & Springsted 2004).\nRecent English-language scholarship on Weil has included texts on her\nconcept of force (Doering 2010), her radicalism (Rozelle-Stone &\nStone 2010), and the relationship in her thought between science and\ndivinity (Morgan 2005), between suffering and trauma (Nelson 2017),\nand between decreation and ethics (Cha 2017). Furthermore, her\nconcepts have influenced recent contributions to questions of identity\n(Cameron 2007), political theology (Lloyd 2011), animality (Pick\n2011), and international relations (Kinsella 2021).\n",
