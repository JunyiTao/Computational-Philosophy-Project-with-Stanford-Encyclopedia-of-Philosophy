For example, a surface cannot appear both round and square,\nor both pure red and pure yellow at the same place at the same time;\nnor can anything seem round or red but not extended. Pautz contends\nthat such impossibilities are metaphysical in strength. In contrast,\nthere is nothing metaphysically or even nomologically impossible, but\nonly irrational, about contradictory or otherwise anomalous beliefs or\ndesires. How is a representationalist to explain the existence of such\nlaws?\n\nSpeaks (2017) responds by questioning whether the laws are\nmetaphysically necessary. Perhaps they arise simply from how we are\nbuilt. We might have had sense modalities that worked differently, in\nsuch a way as to allow representation of the anomalous states of\naffairs.\n\nFurther, even if the impossibilities are metaphysical, they may arise\nfrom the metaphysics of functional roles of sensory states rather than\nfrom the sense modalities\u2019 representational capacities.\n",
