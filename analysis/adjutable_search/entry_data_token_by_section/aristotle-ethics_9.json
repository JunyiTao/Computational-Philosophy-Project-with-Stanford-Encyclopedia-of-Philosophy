    "main_text": "Akrasia\n7. Akrasia\n\nIn VII.1\u201310 Aristotle investigates character\ntraits\u2014continence and incontinence\u2014that are not as\nblameworthy as the vices but not as praiseworthy as the virtues. (We\nbegan our discussion of these qualities in section 4.) The Greek terms\nare akrasia (\u201cincontinence\u201d; literally:\n\u201clack of mastery\u201d) and enkrateia\n(\u201ccontinence\u201d; literally \u201cmastery\u201d). An\nakratic person goes against reason as a result of some pathos\n(\u201cemotion\u201d, \u201cfeeling\u201d). Like the akratic, an\nenkratic person experiences a feeling that is contrary to reason; but\nunlike the akratic, he acts in accordance with reason. His defect\nconsists solely in the fact that, more than most people, he\nexperiences passions that conflict with his rational choice. The\nakratic person has not only this defect, but has the further flaw that\nhe gives in to feeling rather than reason more often than the average\nperson.\n\nAristotle distinguishes two kinds of akrasia: impetuosity\n(propeteia) and weakness (astheneia). The person who\nis weak goes through a process of deliberation and makes a choice; but\nrather than act in accordance with his reasoned choice, he acts under\nthe influence of a passion. By contrast, the impetuous person does not\ngo through a process of deliberation and does not make a reasoned\nchoice; he simply acts under the influence of a passion. At the time\nof action, the impetuous person experiences no internal conflict. But\nonce his act has been completed, he regrets what he has done. One\ncould say that he deliberates, if deliberation were something that\npost-dated rather than preceded action; but the thought process he\ngoes through after he acts comes too late to save him from error.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that when Aristotle talks about\nimpetuosity and weakness, he is discussing chronic conditions. The\nimpetuous person is someone who acts emotionally and fails to\ndeliberate not just once or twice but with some frequency; he makes\nthis error more than most people do. Because of this pattern in his\nactions, we would be justified in saying of the impetuous person that\nhad his passions not prevented him from doing so, he would have\ndeliberated and chosen an action different from the one he did\nperform.\n\nThe two kinds of passions that Aristotle focuses on, in his treatment\nof akrasia, are the appetite for pleasure and anger. Either\ncan lead to impetuosity and weakness. But Aristotle gives pride of\nplace to the appetite for pleasure as the passion that undermines\nreason. He calls the kind of akrasia caused by an appetite\nfor pleasure \u201cunqualified akrasia\u201d\u2014or, as\nwe might say, akrasia \u201cfull stop\u201d;\nakrasia caused by anger he considers a qualified form of\nakrasia and calls it akrasia \u201cwith respect to\nanger\u201d. We thus have these four forms of akrasia: (A)\nimpetuosity caused by pleasure, (B) impetuosity caused by anger, (C)\nweakness caused by pleasure (D) weakness caused by anger. It should be\nnoticed that Aristotle\u2019s treatment of akrasia is\nheavily influenced by Plato\u2019s tripartite division of the soul in\nthe Republic. Plato holds that either the spirited part\n(which houses anger, as well as other emotions) or the appetitive part\n(which houses the desire for physical pleasures) can disrupt the\ndictates of reason and result in action contrary to reason. The same\nthreefold division of the soul can be seen in Aristotle\u2019s\napproach to this topic.\n\nAlthough Aristotle characterizes akrasia and\nenkrateia in terms of a conflict between reason and feeling,\nhis detailed analysis of these states of mind shows that what takes\nplace is best described in a more complicated way. For the feeling\nthat undermines reason contains some thought, which may be implicitly\ngeneral. As Aristotle says, anger \u201creasoning as it were that one\nmust fight against such a thing, is immediately provoked\u201d\n(1149a33\u20134). And although in the next sentence he denies that\nour appetite for pleasure works in this way, he earlier had said that\nthere can be a syllogism that favors pursuing enjoyment:\n\u201cEverything sweet is pleasant, and this is sweet\u201d leads to\nthe pursuit of a particular pleasure (1147a31\u201330). Perhaps what\nhe has in mind is that pleasure can operate in either way: it can\nprompt action unmediated by a general premise, or it can prompt us to\nact on such a syllogism. By contrast, anger always moves us by\npresenting itself as a bit of general, although hasty, reasoning.\n\nBut of course Aristotle does not mean that a conflicted person has\nmore than one faculty of reason. Rather his idea seems to be that in\naddition to our full-fledged reasoning capacity, we also have\npsychological mechanisms that are capable of a limited range of\nreasoning. When feeling conflicts with reason, what occurs is better\ndescribed as a fight between feeling-allied-with-limited-reasoning and\nfull-fledged reason. Part of us\u2014reason\u2014can remove itself\nfrom the distorting influence of feeling and consider all relevant\nfactors, positive and negative. But another part of us\u2014feeling\nor emotion\u2014has a more limited field of reasoning\u2014and\nsometimes it does not even make use of it.\n\nAlthough \u201cpassion\u201d is sometimes used as a translation of\nAristotle\u2019s word pathos (other alternatives are\n\u201cemotion\u201d and \u201cfeeling\u201d), it is important to\nbear in mind that his term does not necessarily designate a strong\npsychological force. Anger is a pathos whether it is weak or\nstrong; so too is the appetite for bodily pleasures. And he clearly\nindicates that it is possible for an akratic person to be defeated by\na weak pathos\u2014the kind that most people would easily be\nable to control (1150a9\u2013b16). So the general explanation for the\noccurrence of akrasia cannot be that the strength of a\npassion overwhelms reason. Aristotle should therefore be acquitted of\nan accusation made against him by J.L. Austin in a well-known footnote\nto his paper, \u201cA Plea For Excuses\u201d. Plato and Aristotle,\nhe says, collapsed all succumbing to temptation into losing control of\nourselves\u2014a mistake illustrated by this example:\n\n\nI am very partial to ice cream, and a bombe is served divided into\nsegments corresponding one to one with the persons at High Table: I am\ntempted to help myself to two segments and do so, thus succumbing to\ntemptation and even conceivably (but why necessarily?) going against\nmy principles. But do I lose control of myself? Do I raven, do I\nsnatch the morsels from the dish and wolf them down, impervious to the\nconsternation of my colleagues? Not a bit of it. We often succumb to\ntemptation with calm and even with finesse. (1957: 24, fn 13 [1961:\n146])\n\n\nWith this, Aristotle can agree: the pathos for the bombe can\nbe a weak one, and in some people that will be enough to get them to\nact in a way that is disapproved by their reason at the very time of\naction.\n\nWhat is most remarkable about Aristotle\u2019s discussion of\nakrasia is that he defends a position close to that of\nSocrates. When he first introduces the topic of akrasia, and\nsurveys some of the problems involved in understanding this\nphenomenon, he says (1145b25\u20138) that Socrates held that there is\nno akrasia, and he describes this as a thesis that clearly\nconflicts with the appearances (phainomena). Since he says\nthat his goal is to preserve as many of the appearances as possible\n(1145b2\u20137), it may come as a surprise that when he analyzes the\nconflict between reason and feeling, he arrives at the conclusion that\nin a way Socrates was right after all (1147b13\u201317). For, he\nsays, the person who acts against reason does not have what is thought\nto be unqualified knowledge; in a way he has knowledge, but in a way\ndoes not.\n\nAristotle explains what he has in mind by comparing akrasia\nto the condition of other people who might be described as knowing in\na way, but not in an unqualified way. His examples are people who are\nasleep, mad, or drunk; he also compares the akratic to a student who\nhas just begun to learn a subject, or an actor on the stage\n(1147a10\u201324). All of these people, he says, can utter the very\nwords used by those who have knowledge; but their talk does not prove\nthat they really have knowledge, strictly speaking.\n\nThese analogies can be taken to mean that the form of akrasia\nthat Aristotle calls weakness rather than impetuosity always results\nfrom some diminution of cognitive or intellectual acuity at the moment\nof action. The akratic says, at the time of action, that he ought not\nto indulge in this particular pleasure at this time. But does he know\nor even believe that he should refrain? Aristotle might be taken to\nreply: yes and no. He has some degree of recognition that he must not\ndo this now, but not full recognition. His feeling, even if it is\nweak, has to some degree prevented him from completely grasping or\naffirming the point that he should not do this. And so in a way\nSocrates was right. When reason remains unimpaired and unclouded, its\ndictates will carry us all the way to action, so long as we are able\nto act.\n\nBut Aristotle\u2019s agreement with Socrates is only partial, because\nhe insists on the power of the emotions to rival, weaken or bypass\nreason. Emotion challenges reason in all three of these ways. In both\nthe akratic and the enkratic, it competes with reason for control over\naction; even when reason wins, it faces the difficult task of having\nto struggle with an internal rival. Second, in the akratic, it\ntemporarily robs reason of its full acuity, thus handicapping it as a\ncompetitor. It is not merely a rival force, in these cases; it is a\nforce that keeps reason from fully exercising its power. And third,\npassion can make someone impetuous; here its victory over reason is so\npowerful that the latter does not even enter into the arena of\nconscious reflection until it is too late to influence action.\n\nSupplementary Document: Alternate Readings of Aristotle on Akrasia\n\n",
