Many proponents of machine translation and\nArtificial Intelligence (AI ) are prime examples of this orientation,\nand the field has become far more sophisticated than in the days when\nthe term \u201chydraulic ram\u201d in an article on dam construction\ncame out \u201cwater buffalo\u201d in the Russian. Many advances\nhave been made in the purely linguistic dimensions of mechanical\ntranslation, enough, obviously, to maintain at least minimal\nplausibility for the claim of distinctness between the two endeavors,\nespecially because of the rising number of users of automatic\ntranslation on their laptops. But as those users also realize, when\nthe text to be translated exceeds the phrase level by much, context\nmust enter in to achieve correct outcomes. In context,\nKhrushchev\u2019s famous \u201cWe will bury you\u201d at the\nU.N. translated fairly literally a Russian colloquialism for which the\nEnglish equivalent would almost surely have been \u201cWe will leave\nyou in the dust\u201d (he was talking about the difference between\nplanned and market economies at the time). Had the U.N. interpreter\nheeded context, the Cold War might have been less chilling, and thus\nperhaps less dangerous.\n With classical Chinese context is almost always essential for\ntranslation, making some interpretation equally\nnecessary. This may be a low level of interpretation, of course;\nsimply ascertaining the correct subject of a sentence where no subject\nis present, or inferring a verb from a prior occurrence, without going\ninto any metaphysical speculations. We should note in passing,\nhowever, that this Chinese example does not automatically refute the\nmachine translation claim of the separateness of the two efforts of\ntranslation and interpretation. If it is indeed the case that\nclassical Chinese is not a close transcription of speech (which it\nisn\u2019t), but embodies a grammar (which it pretty much does), it\ncan be argued that it is thus at least somewhat not a natural language\nin the way Natural Language Processing scholars use the term for\nwritten documents they work with, and hence not a genuine\ncounterexample to the AI claim.\n This issue bears directly on another well known philosophical\ncontroversy. In 1980 John Searle published his famous \u201cChinese\nRoom Argument\u201d (Searle 1980). He was attempting to counter the\nAI claim that computers could be said to be intelligent\u2014could\nthink, had minds\u2014if they could pass the \u201cTuring\nTest\u201d (Turing 1950). His argument was that the Turing test was\ninadequate for establishing computer intelligence, conducting a\nthought experiment in which a person placed in a room with an\nappropriate computer program, could \u201cread\u201d strings of\nsymbols (Chinese characters) slid under the door into the computer,\nand the program would generate an appropriate symbolic response, hence\npass the \u201cTuring Test\u201d for intelligence even though the\nperson at the computer didn\u2019t recognize a single Chinese\ngraph. The \u201ctest\u201d was that if 70% of the people (later\nreduced to 30%) who engaged in the keyboard exchanges for five minutes\ncould not tell the AI responses from those of a native Chinese\nspeaker, the machine was intelligent.\n A vast literature has grown up around the \u201cChinese Room\nArgument\u201d, in the philosophy of mind and related areas, which it\nwould take us too far afield to consider herein. But we should note\nthat Searle\u2019s example presupposes that it is modern spoken\nChinese that is being recorded, not the classical language. In the\nformer, the parts of speech can normally be established by syntax\nalone, surely an asset in sorting out semantic elements\nappropriately. But the classical language always requires context to\nmake clear the grammatical function of a graph, and it will surely be\na long time (if ever) before any program could include not only the\nsyntax, but all of the contexts necessary for correctly\n\u201creading\u201d the semantics of the sentence(s).  Establishing\ncontext requires common sense, which computers remain notorious for\nlacking.\nReplacement tests for Turing\u2019s based on common sense are now\nbeing worked on, (Levesque, et al. 2012), and a future work may allow\nappropriate exchanges in classical Chinese to pass such a test. But\nuntil then Searle\u2019s conclusion about the inseparability of\ntranslation and interpretation will continue to have force, and we can\nget on with the issues and problems attendant on the links between\nthem in Chinese Philosophy as they impinge on contemporary\nmetaphysical concerns.\n",
