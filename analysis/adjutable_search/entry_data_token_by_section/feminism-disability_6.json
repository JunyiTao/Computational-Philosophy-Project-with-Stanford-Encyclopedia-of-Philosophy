    "main_text": "Ethics and Inclusion\n6. Ethics and Inclusion\n\n\nIn general, people with physical and mental disabilities have at\nleast their experiences of social exclusion in common. Exclusion looms\nlarge in many disabled people's lives and shapes their expectations and\naspirations. This is a familiar story in the life\nhistories of many individuals who are identified with non-dominant\ngroups.\n\n\nPresumptions about biological unfitness and burdensomeness often have\nbeen invoked to engineer enforced segregation of parts of the\npopulation. Courts have endorsed the separation of people identified\nas being of different races by advancing the rationale that\nsegregating social schemes merely acknowledge \u201cnatural\u201d\naffinities among people of the same race and \u201cnatural\u201d\nantipathies among people of different races. The supposed benefits of\nbiological separatism also have been cited to deny women employment\nthat would place them in the company of men. For example, when a state\nlaw denying women the opportunity to be employed as bartenders was\nappealed to the U.S. Supreme Court as a violation of the\nconstitutional guarantee of equal protection, the Court declared the\nexclusion to be constitutional because of the \u201creal\u201d\ndifferences between men and women. The majority opinion explicitly\naffirmed that women's presence \u201cnaturally\u201d incites males\nto lust and violence, and that women do not have the physical ability\nto impose orderly behavior on the rowdy patrons of a bar (Silvers and\nStein 2002).\n\n\nSimilarly, people with disabilities have been characterized as being\nbiologically unfit to execute the responsibilities and thereby to\nenjoy the privileges of citizenship, to work and play with nondisabled\npeople, and to be permitted reproductive freedom. For example, people\nwith mental retardation, cerebral palsy, blindness, and deafness all\nhave suffered the state's sterilizing them, removing their\nchildren from their custody based only on their disability, denying\nthem access to public education on the ground that their presence\nharmed other children, and institutionalizing them to protect citizens\nwho function in species-typical ways from having to have contact with\nthem (Lombardo, 2008). Similar legally endorsed harm is a familiar\ntheme in the history of women, racial minorities, native people, and\ngays and lesbians.\n\n\nSearching for ethical grounds to condemn the kinds of exclusions to\nwhich women have been subjected, feminist thinkers have been\ndisappointed by traditional metaethical, moral and political\nanalyses. Feminists have found traditional moral philosophy\nsuspect for inflating typical male behaviors into paradigmatic moral\nactions and traditional political philosophy equally suspect for being\nbereft of remedies for the moral and political challenges posed by such\nbiased and pretextual exclusion. Although standard ethical and\npolitical theorizing claims as a matter of principle to embrace\neveryone alike, feminist critiques have shown that their presumptions\noften exclude devalued kinds of people from significant moral,\npolitical and social roles (for example, Putnam 1993 draws attention to\nRawls' exclusion of people with serious disabilities from the\nbasic level of formulation of principles of justice).\nConsequently, feminist philosophers such as Annette Baier (1986, 1987),\nEva Kittay (1998), Martha Nussbaum (2001, 2006), and Iris Marion Young\n(1990a; 1990b) have pioneered the exploration of more inclusive\nalternative theories (to mention just a few leading feminists whose\ntheories have been influenced by a concern to address the\nphenomena of disability adequately). They have relocated the search\nfor an adequate center for moral and political philosophy to, for\nexample, the ethics and politics of trust and care, the virtues of\ndependency, the sustenance of capabilities fundamental to human life, and\nthe establishment of moralized interconnectedness among people who do\nnot occupy similar positions in life. Albeit differing from one\nanother in their approaches to feminist ethical and political theory,\nall build in concern for achieving adequate philosophical treatment to\naddress problematic kinds of interactions between people with\ndisabilities and the nondisabled, or to illuminate ways of framing\ndistributive policies that are equal to the situations of both\nnondisabled and disabled individuals. (For another explicitly feminist\nexample of the former, see Mahowald in Silvers, Wasserman and Mahowald\n1998 and for a feminism compatible example of the latter, see Becker 2012.)\n\n\n\nTwo main approaches to addressing the social exclusion of disabled\npeople have surfaced in the philosophical literature that refers to\nthem. Some writers focus foremost on procedural justice to open\nup disabled people's opportunities for social participation (Young\n1992; Silvers 1998b; Anderson 1999; Silvers and Francis 2005).\nAnderson urges that everyone be guaranteed effective access to the\nsocial conditions of their freedom in virtue of their equality, not\ntheir inferiority. To illustrate, she notes that what Deaf people\nobject to is not their lack of hearing but that \u201ceveryone else\nhas rigged the means of communication in ways that leave them out of\nthe conversation. One can detect this injustice without investigating\nanyone's preferences or subjective states\u201d (Anderson 1999, \n334). Silvers proposes a procedure called historical\ncounterfactualizing to identify practices catering to the nondisabled\nmajority that unjustly exclude people with disabilities (Silvers\n1998b; Hoffman 2003).\n\n\nOthers take the answer to lie first of all in distributive justice to\nincrease provision of resources to the disabled and to families caring\nfor the disabled (Kittay 1998; Kittay 2001; Nussbaum 2006). Nussbaum,\nfor example, begins with a comprehensive idea of the good to guide\njustice. She develops a list of capabilities necessary to live with\ndignity and holds that people with disabilities deserve support to\nachieve threshold levels of these capabilities, if they can do so,\neven if more resources must be deployed to assist them than other\npeople need to reach the same level. Kittay, another example, seeks\nsupportive conditions for those who interact in dependency relations,\nboth dependents and their caregivers, arguing that both must be\nassisted in order to achieve good care, and therefore justice, for the\ndependent. To effect such an outcome through justice, Kittay believes,\nrequires maintaining a social order that secures care for dependents\nas a main purpose of formulating fundamental principles of justice and\na theoretical basis that downgrades the value of independence, at\nleast for disabled people (Kittay 2011).  Although many commentators\nendorse the prominence Kittay assigns to (re)organizing society to\nprovide various kinds of care and to protect care workers, Kittay's\nunderstanding of how her view relates to liberal political has been\nquestioned. One problem has to do with Kittay's assumptions about how\nreciprocity functions in liberal theory, and another is about the role\nof reciprocating relationships on her view (Whitney 2011). Another is\nabut whether the vulnerability of utter dependents is sufficiently\nsimilar to other kinds of vulnerability, such as that of care workers,\nto warrant taking the support relationship needed by utter dependents\nas the basic model for social affiliation and obligation (Bhandary\n2010).\n\n\nNeither of these approaches to justice\u2014one foregrounding\nprocedural reform and the other revising resource distribution \u2013\ndenies the importance of the other's objectives. In great part, they\ndiverge on matters of practical priorities, but also on matters of\nwhether moral priority should be given to agreement about what is\nright, or instead about what is good. However, some feminist thinkers\nwho have questioned the ability of traditional moral theories to take\naccount of the needs and experiences of both care-receivers and\ncare-givers are inclined to portray caring conduct as inspired not by\nduty but by the compelling recognition of another's need and of one's\nown capacity to relieve that person's need.  Consequently, they have\ncriticized rights-based and obligation-catering procedural theories\nfor abstracting excessively from experienced encounters with\ndependents who need protection and support (Kittay, 1998, for\nexample). Other feminist philosophers, such as Baier and Nussbaum,\nhave raised a different question about the adequacy of traditional\nmoral theories to address the phenomena of interdependency. Their\nissue is about validation rather than motivation. They have queried\nwhether approaches centered on independent individuals contracting\nfreely and reciprocally with one another for mutual benefit can give\nplausible accounts of obligations to people who are, temporarily or\npermanently, greatly dependent on others for physical, cognitive or\nemotional support.\n\n\nNussbaum (2006) suggests that the source of political philosophy's\nignoring the disabled lies in a foundational assumption of social\ncontract theory. She criticizes Rawls for casting citizens in the role\nof rough equals who relate because they can benefit each other, saying\n\u201cInstead of picturing one another as rough equals making a\nbargain, we may be better off thinking of one another as people with\nvarying degrees of capacity and disability, in a variety of different\nrelationships of interdependency with one another\u201d (2001,\nB9). Construing reciprocal bargaining as the foundational and\ntherefore paradigmatic social connection among citizens \u201ceffaces\nthe more asymmetrical forms of dependency that human life contains:\nthe need for care in infancy, extreme age, and periods of severe\nillness or a lifetime of severe disability,\u201d she objects (2001,\nB9).\n\n\nNussbaum thinks traditional social contract theory is misguided in\ntesting basic conceptions of justice against self-regarding reasons,\nthereby assigning self-regarding reasons preeminence over\nother-regarding ones. And surely it is hard to see how a\nconception that derives justice from decisions featuring self-regard\n(such as whether particular formulations of principle would benefit\none's self regardless of one's circumstances) can provide\nadequately protective principles for each individual in relation to\nothers, especially in view of the vulnerabilities individuals accept as\nthe price of being part of cooperative schemes.\n\n\nStimulated by Nussbaum's critique, Silvers and Francis (2005) return\nto Baier's insights about the centrality of trust in moral\ninteraction. They propose extrapolating principles of justice from\npractices that facilitate people's relying on, and thereby making\nthemselves vulnerable to, each other. Practices that nourish such\ntrust are crucial components of social cooperation.  Moreover, unlike\nbargaining, which requires strategizing and therefore complex\nhigh-order cognitive skills, trusting is conduct that people without\ndisabilities and people with almost every kind of disability equally\ncan engage in. People who cannot articulate their decisions, and who\nmay not even be able to arrive at decisions, nevertheless may express\nbestowal or withdrawal of their trust.  As a mode of relating to one\nanother, trust is par excellence suited to facilitating\ninteractions between individuals who in various respects are\nasymmetrically positioned in regard to one another.  Silvers and\nFrancis argue that building trust is a more inclusive process than\nbargaining about principles of justice. Building trust therefore\noffers a more adequate practice for achieving justice for both\ndisabled and nondisabled people than the reciprocating exchanges\ncalled for in strategic contracting.\n",
