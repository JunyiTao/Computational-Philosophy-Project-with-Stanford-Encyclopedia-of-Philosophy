Belief\n\nWe now present some of Price\u2019s significant contributions to the\nphilosophical study of belief, including belief ascriptions\n (\u00a76.1),\n the variety of beliefs\n (\u00a76.6\u20136.8),\n their relations to other states such as knowledge\n (\u00a76.1;\n 1969: chs. 1\u20133), the analysis of \u201cone\u2019s evidence\nfor belief\u201d\n (\u00a76.2;\n 1969: ch. 4), especially from his 1960 Gifford Lectures, published as\nhis magnum opus Belief (1969). Their backbone is his defence\nof the dispositional analysis of belief\n (\u00a76.4),\n in his eyes the standard modern analysis, specifically against\noccurrentist analyses (e.g., Hume and Cook Wilson)\n (\u00a76.3).\n",
