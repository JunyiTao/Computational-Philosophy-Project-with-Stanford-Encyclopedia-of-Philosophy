The Mystical Theology has\nthis last, most arcane form of theology as its subject. Negations are\nproperly applied not only to the names of the symbolic theology. Any\nand all of the divine names must be negated, beginning with those of\nthe symbolic theology, continuing with the intelligible names and\nconcluding with the theological representations. The godhead is no\nmore \u201cspirit,\u201d \u201csonship,\u201d and\n\u201cfatherhood\u201d than it is \u201cintellect\u201d or\n\u201casleep.\u201d These negations must be distinguished from\nprivations. A privation is simply the absence of a given predicate\nthat could just as easily be present. The absence of the predicate is\nopposed to its presence: \u201clifeless\u201d is opposed to\n\u201cliving.\u201d But when we say that the godhead is not\n\u201cliving,\u201d we do not mean that it is\n\u201clifeless.\u201d The godhead is beyond the lifeless as well as\nbeyond the living. For this reason, Dionysius says that our\naffirmations of the godhead are not opposed to our negations, but that\nboth must be transcended: even the negations must be negated.\n\nThe most controversial and arcane passages of the Mystical\nTheology revolve around the mystical as taken in itself and not\nas the act of negating the other forms of theology. Dionysius says\nthat after all speaking, reading, and comprehending of the names\nceases, there follows a divine silence, darkness, and unknowing. All\nthree of these characteristics seem privative, as though they were\nsimply being the absence of speech, sight, and knowledge respectively.\nBut Dionysius does not treat them as privative. Instead, he uses\ntemporal and spatial language to mark off a special place and time for\nthem. Using as his example the account of Moses\u2019 ascent up Mount\nSinai in the Hebrew scriptures, Dionysius says that after Moses\nascends through the sensible and intelligible contemplation of God, he\nthen enters the darkness above the mountain\u2019s peak. The darkness\nis located above the mountain, and Moses enters it after his\ncontemplation of God in the various forms of theology. Dionysius\nleaves the relation between Moses and the darkness highly obscure.\nSome commentators reduce it to a form of knowing, albeit an\nextraordinary form of knowing. Others reduce it to a form of affective\nexperience, in which Moses feels something that he can never know or\nexplain in words. Dionysius himself does not give decisive evidence in\nfavor of either interpretive move. He speaks only of Moses\u2019\n\u201cunion\u201d with the ineffable, invisible, unknowable\ngodhead.\n",
