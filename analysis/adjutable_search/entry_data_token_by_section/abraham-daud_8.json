    "main_text": "Main Themes in ER || Cosmogony and Intelligences\n5.4 Cosmogony and Intelligences\n\n\nTo explain how the plurality of the sub-lunar world can proceed from\nthis absolutely one God, Ibn Daud presents the theory of\n\u201cintermediaries\u201d, as he found it in the works of the Muslim\nphilosophers. This theory holds that there are secondary substances\n(or: heavenly intelligences) that serve as intermediaries between God\nand the lower world. His first step is to prove the existence of the\nActive Intellect, the lowest in the series of heavenly intelligences.\nHis proof is based on the premise that the human intellect passes from\npotentiality into actuality, which can only be due to an agent that\npossesses the end of motion (that is, knowledge) in actuality. Ibn Daud\nthen proceeds to prove the existence of other incorporeal substances,\nfor which he likewise bases himself on the Aristotelian theory of\nmotion, an approach that is new to Jewish philosophy. Taking the\ncircularity of the motions of the heavenly bodies as a point of\ndeparture, he argues that the souls of the spheres in their motions\npass from potentiality into actuality just as the human soul does. This\nmotion must be caused by the intellects of the spheres that are objects\nof desire for their souls. The existence of heavenly incorporeal\nsubstances thus having been established, Ibn Daud goes on to describe\nhow the lower proceeds from the higher, according to \u201cthe\nphilosophers\u201d. In their view, a first intelligence emanates from\nthe One, which is similarly incorporeal, but not simple, as it has a\ncause, which involves composition in this entity. In a three-fold act\nof cognition, this intelligence produces a triad of heavenly intellect,\nsphere-soul and heavenly body, and this process is repeated until the\nsphere of the moon to which the active intellect belongs. From the\nvarious motions of the spheres, matter and forms emanate on the\nsub-lunar world. The details of this process are not pertinent to our\ncurrent purposes. It is more relevant to note that Ibn Daud criticizes\nthe emanation-theory of the philosophers by claiming that there are no\ndemonstrative proofs for it. In his view, they invented their theory to\nsolve the problem of how many can come forth from one, yet, at the same\ntime, it seems to raise more questions than it actually solves. As he\nputs it: \u201cThey escaped from one defamation but fell into\nothers\u201d (ER W 67; S 159b).\n\n\nIbn Daud\u2019s own position, however, is far from clear. There is\nno doubt that he accepts the notion of a hierarchical causal chain of\nheavenly souls and intelligences that have an influence on the heavenly\nworld. However, he leaves his reader in the dark as to how they proceed\nfrom God, claiming that the human intellect is too limited to grasp\nthis and that the philosophers err when they assume that the intellect\ncan know everything. More generally, he does never address the issue of (eternal)\nemanation versus creation. Although he equates the God of the\nphilosophers with the Biblical Creator, he offers no arguments in\nfavour of creation. All that we hear is that \u201cgrand\nthings\u201d, such as the Ten Commandments, come directly from God.\nHowever, he fails to explain how this should be reconciled with the\ntheory of emanation, according to which only one thing proceeds from\nGod directly and other things indirectly. Likewise, Ibn Daud tells us\nin one passage that matter does not proceed from God directly; whereas\nin another he bluntly states that matter is God\u2019s creation\nwithout offering any argumentation for this last statement.\n\n\nIbn Daud identifies the intelligences, which are also referred to as\nelevated, simple, separate or incorporeal substances, with the angels\nin Scripture that are intermediaries between God and man. Indeed, it is\nprecisely their function as secondary causes that turn them into an\nindispensable element in his thought. Firstly, he uses the angels to\navoid the unworthy notion that God should occupy himself with the\nparticulars of the terrestrial world, which would imply plurality in\ndivine knowledge. According to Ibn Daud, the angels are entrusted with\nthis task. Secondly, Ibn Daud needs the notion that the angels are\nintermediaries for the interpretation of certain biblical texts that\nseem to imply a change of will in God, which is tantamount to plurality\nin his essence. His solution is that such verses refer not to God, but\nto various classes of intermediaries instead. By this interpretation,\nwhich is the outcome of philosophical reasoning, Ibn Daud also sought to\ncounter the charges of anthropomorphism that were made by the Muslim\ntheologian Ibn Hazm.\n",
