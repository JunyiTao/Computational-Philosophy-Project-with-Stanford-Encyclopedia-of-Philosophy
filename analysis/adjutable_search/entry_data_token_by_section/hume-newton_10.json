    "main_text": "In What Sense Was Hume a Newtonian? || Analysis and synthesis\n4.8 Analogy\n\nAs Hume repeatedly emphasizes, it is impossible to reveal the\n\u201cultimate causes of our mental actions\u201d, and we have to be\ncontent with \u201cexperience and analogy\u201d in explaining any\nact of the mind \u201cby producing other instances, which are\nanalogous to it, and other principles, which facilitate its\noperation\u201d (THN 1.1.7.11). Finding analogies between different\ninstances gives one the chance to explain causes and reduce them to\n\u201cmore general principles\u201d (THN App. 3). For Hume,\nanalogical reasoning is the key to most of our everyday and\nphilosophical conclusions in empirical matters. Causal reasoning is\npartly but crucially founded on our capacity to recognize resemblances\namong different instances, and to extend our inferences based on\nprevious observations to similar but unobserved instances. Thus, the\nrecognition of resemblances is at the heart of our reasoning\nconcerning any matter of fact, and the limits of this kind of\nreasoning are exactly where our capacity to recognize resemblances\nends (THN 1.3.13.25). The proper method of both natural and moral\nphilosophy is \n\n\nto reduce the principles, productive of natural phaenomena, to a\ngreater simplicity, and to resolve the many particular effects into a\nfew general causes, by means of reasonings from analogy, experience,\nand observation. (EHU 4.12, 11.30; THN 1.1.7.11) \n\n\nIt is history\u2014natural and civil as well\u2014that provides the\npool of observations from which philosophers\u2014natural and moral\nones as well\u2014relying on analogies can establish explanatory\nprinciples. Finding analogies between different instances gives one\nthe chance to explain causes and reduce them to \u201cmore general\nprinciples\u201d (THN App.3).\n\nIn the Dialogues, and especially in the sections criticizing\nthe design argument, Hume seems to be more critical of analogical\nreasoning than he is in his other passages of similar methodological\nrelevance; nevertheless, Philo pronounces \u201canalogies and\nresemblances\u201d reliable enough to serve as the \u201csole proofs\nof the Copernican system\u201d (Dialogues 2.26). Given that\nin Hume\u2019s epistemology the category of proof provides\nthe highest level of epistemic certainty available for any piece of\nempirical knowledge, analogical reasoning is a highly esteemed way of\nreaching theoretical conclusions in exploring the principles of nature\nand human nature (EHU 6n10). Hume\u2019s doubts in the\nDialogues concerning analogical arguments from design\nprimarily do not arise from the weaknesses of analogical reasoning,\nbut mainly from the uniqueness of the world, which does not provide a\nsufficient pool of instances among which analogies can be found (EHU\n11.26).\n\nAlthough the cognitive role of analogy is central, it relies on\nsubjective judgment and so it can have idiosyncratic manifestations.\nThings are similar in an infinite number of ways, and only some of\nthese similarities can be exploited with the hope of cognitive benefit\n(THN 1.1.5.3). As any thing may resemble any other in an infinite\nnumber of ways only some resemblances can explain associative\nrelations between ideas. Resemblances of cognitive relevance are\ntherefore not passively detected, but they are actively produced by\nmemory: we remember past instances as resembling (THN\n1.4.6.18). Depending on the resemblances one recognizes among\nparticular instances, one can end up with different and potentially\nconflicting conclusions concerning the causes of phenomena. Therefore,\nas Hume puts it:\n\n\nNo questions in philosophy are more difficult, than when a number of\ncauses present themselves for the same phaenomenon, to determine which\nis the principal and predominant. There seldom is any very precise\nargument to fix our choice, and men must be contented to be guided by\na kind of taste or fancy, arising from analogy, and a comparison of\nsimilar instances. (THN 3.2.3.4n71)\n\n\nThis is one reason why \u201cTis not solely in poetry and music, we\nmust follow our taste and sentiment, but likewise in philosophy\u201d\n(THN 1.3.8.12). And while the subjectivity of analogical reasoning is\na source of creativity and insight, it also puts the objectivity and\ncertainty of Newton\u2019s epistemic ideal beyond reach.\n",
