    "main_text": "Analyses of Disposition Ascriptions || Defending the Simple Conditional Analysis\n1.3 Defending the Simple Conditional Analysis\n\nDespite the apparent force, however, it is not universally agreed that\nthese examples undermine SCA. Some philosophers insist\nthat SCA, when properly understood, is not susceptible\nat all to the alleged counterexamples, whilst some others maintain\nthat they do refute SCA but they can be avoided by\nsuitable sophistications of it. The first position is supported by\nChoi (2006, 2008) and Gundersen (2002), who challenge the assumption\nabout what dispositions an object possesses in each of the alleged\ncounterexamples. They emphasise that when the glass is protected by\nthe packing material it is no longer disposed to\nbreak when struck; rather, it is disposed to break when\nstruck in the absence of the packing material. This is\nin line with SCA since the glass would indeed break\nif struck in the absence of the packing material although it wouldn\u2019t\nbreak if struck under its current conditions\u2014mutatis\nmutandis for the example of reverse-cycle finks. Similarly,\nChoi suggests that when the styrofoam dish is in the neighborhood of\nthe Hater of Styrofoam, it is indeed disposed to break when struck; it\nis not disposed to break when struck in the absence of the\nHater of Styrofoam. This suggestion is consistent\nwith SCA since the dish wouldn\u2019t break if struck in\nthe absence of the Hater of Styrofoam although it would break if\nstruck under its current conditions\u2014mutatis\nmutandis for the example of finks.\n\nThis tactic can be readily generalised so as to distinguish two\ndispositions, the simple disposition whose stimulus condition and\nmanifestation are the event of being struck and the event of breaking,\nrespectively, on the one hand, and the complex disposition whose\nstimulus condition and manifestation are the event of being\nstruck in the absence of finks, reverse\u2013cycle\nfinks, maskers, and mimickers and the event of breaking,\nrespectively, on the other. The simple counterfactual conditional\nassociated with the first disposition (namely,\n\u2018if \\(x\\) were struck it would break\u2019) is\nfalse in the examples of reverse-cycle finks and maskers and true in\nthe examples of finks and mimickers but the ascription of the first\ndisposition (namely, \u2018\\(x\\) is disposed to break when\nstruck\u2019) correspondingly has the same truth value in each\nexample; meanwhile, the ascription of the second disposition (namely,\n\u2018\\(x\\) is disposed to break when struck in the\nabsence of finks, reverse\u2013cycle finks, maskers, and\nmimickers\u2019) is true in the examples of reverse-cycle finks\nand maskers and false in the examples of finks and mimickers but the\nsimple counterfactual conditional associated with the second\ndisposition (namely, \u2018if \\(x\\) were\nstruck in the absence of finks, reverse\u2013cycle\nfinks, maskers, and mimickers it would break\u2019)\ncorrespondingly has the same truth value in each example.\n\nManley & Wasserman (2008) object that this defence\nof SCA falls prey to what they call the problem of\n\u2018Achilles\u2019 heels\u2019 (for more on Manley & Wasserman\u2019s\nobjection, see Bonevac, Dever & Sosa 2011; Choi 2011b; Manley\n& Wasserman 2011). Hajek (forthcoming) agrees with Choi and\nGundersen that the alleged counterexamples to SCA fail but\ndisagrees with them, arguing that SCA is susceptible to what\nhe calls \u2018minkish\u2019 counterexamples. Another line of\ncriticism of Choi and Gundersen\u2019s strategy is to appeal to the\nintrinsicness of dispositions, which we will discuss in the next\nsection.\n",
