This idea has two\nparts: estimation, and its accuracy. On this approach, one\u2019s\ncredence in a proposition A is one\u2019s estimate of\nthe truth value of A, where A\u2019s truth value is\nidentified with 1 if it is true and 0 if it is false (Jeffrey 1986).\nThe closer one\u2019s credence in A is to the truth value of\nA, the more accurate one\u2019s estimate is. Then a\nBayesian may argue that one\u2019s credences ought to be\nprobabilistic, for otherwise the overall accuracy of one\u2019s\ncredence assignment would be dominated\u2014namely, it\nwould, come what may, be lower than the overall accuracy of another\ncredence assignment that one could have adopted. To some Bayesians,\nthis gives a distinctively epistemic reason or explanation why\none\u2019s credences ought to be probabilistic. The result is the\nso-called accuracy-dominance argument for Probabilism (Joyce\n1998). This approach has also been extended to argue for the Principle\nof Conditionalization (Briggs & Pettigrew 2020). For more on this\napproach, see the entry on\n epistemic utility arguments for probabilism\n as well as Pettigrew (2016).\n\nThere is a third proposed type of foundation for Bayesian\nepistemology. It appeals to a kind of doxastic state called\ncomparative probability, which concerns a person\u2019s\ntaking one proposition to be more probable than, or as\nprobable as, or less probable than another proposition.\nOn this approach, we postulate some bridge principles that connect\none\u2019s credences to one\u2019s comparative probabilities. Here\nis an example of such a bridge principle: for any propositions\nX and Y, if X is equivalent to the disjunction of\ntwo incompatible propositions, each of which one takes to be\nmore probable than Y, then one\u2019s credence in X\nshould be more than twice of that in Y. With such\nbridge principles, a Bayesian may argue from norms for comparative\nprobabilities to norms for credences, such as Probabilism. See\nFishburn (1986) for the historical development of this approach. See\nStef\u00e1nsson (2017) for a recent defense and development. For a\ngeneral survey of this approach, see Konek (2019). This approach has\nbeen extended by Joyce (2003: sec. 4) to justify the Principle of\nConditionalization.\n\nThe above are just some of the attempts to provide foundations for\nBayesian epistemology. For more, see the surveys by Weisberg (2011:\nsec. 4) and Easwaran (2011).\n\nThere is a distinctive class of worries for all the three proposed\nfoundations presented above, due to the fact that they rely on one or\nanother account of the nature of credences. This is where Bayesian\nepistemology meets philosophy of mind. Recall that they try to\nunderstand credences in relation to some other mental states: (i)\nbetting dispositions, (ii) estimates of truth values, or (iii)\ncomparative probabilities. But those accounts of credences are\napparently vulnerable to counterexamples. (An example was mentioned\nabove: a person who dislikes the anxiety caused by betting seems to be\na counterexample to the betting account of credences). For more on\nsuch worries, see Eriksson and H\u00e1jek (2007). For more on\naccounts of credences, see\n section 3.3 of the entry on interpretations of probability\n and\n section 3.4 of the entry on imprecise probabilities.\n\nThere is a fourth, application-driven style of argument for\nnorms for credences that seems to be explicit or implicit in the minds\nof many Bayesians. The idea is that a good argument for the two core\nBayesian norms can be obtained by appealing to applications. The goal\nis to account for a comprehensive range of intuitively good\nepistemic practices, all done with a simple set of general\nnorms consisting of little or nothing more than the two core Bayesian\nnorms. If this Bayesian normative system is so good that, of the known\ncompetitors, it strikes the best balance of those two virtues just\nmentioned\u2014comprehensiveness and simplicity\u2014then\nthat is a good reason for accepting the two core Bayesian\nnorms. In fact, the method just described is applicable to any norm,\nfor credences or for actions, in epistemology or in ethics. Some\nphilosophers argue that this method in its full generality, called\nReflective Equilibrium, is the ultimate method for finding a\ngood reason for or against norms (Goodman 1955; Rawls 1971). For more\non this method and its controversies, see the entry on\n reflective equilibrium.\n\nThe above are some ways to argue for Bayesian norms. The rest of this\nintroductory tutorial is meant to sketch some general objections,\nleaving detailed discussions to subsequent sections.\n\n\n",
