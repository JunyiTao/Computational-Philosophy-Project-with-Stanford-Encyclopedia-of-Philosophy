    "main_text": "Applications of the Logistic Method || The Translation Argument\n3.3 The Translation Argument\n\nConsider the sentences\n\n(1)\nSeneca said that man is a rational animal\n(2)\nColumbus believed that the world is round.\n\n\nA natural analysis of such sentences is that they express a relation\nbetween Seneca or Columbus and the propositions that man is a rational\nanimal or that the world is round, where such propositions are\nobjective abstract entities that are the ultimate vehicles of truth\nand meaning. But there has been\u2014and no doubt always will\nbe\u2014skepticism about the existence of such entities and this has\nmotivated the view that sentences such as (1) and (2) express\nrelations between agents and sentence types or even particular\ninscriptions (or other tokens) of sentences of a particular language,\nwhere sentences are assumed to be more concrete than propositions.\nWhile this assumption of concreteness seems highly questionable in the\ncase of sentence types, Carnap and others nevertheless vigorously\npursued the project of analyzing (1) and (2) in terms that relate\nagents to such types. (The theory that saying and believing are\nrelations to particular physical tokens is obviously implausible.\nContrary to what it predicts, the destruction of such tokens would not\nhave voided Seneca\u2019s belief.) In response, Church deployed his\ntranslation argument (CTA) that if we limit our ontology to sentence\ntypes, then our semantic theory will not be able to provide a true\nanalysis of sentences like (1) and (2). (This is a crucial part of\nChurch\u2019s broader argument that no philosophical theory that is\nboth true and humanly understandable can do without propositions. We\nreturn to the rest of the argument in\n \u00a76.3.)\n\nCTA\u2014as formulated in Church\u2019s (1950a)\u2014is\nspecifically directed at Carnap\u2019s (1947) analysis of sentences\nlike (1) and (2), which in turn appeals to a particular notion of\nsynonymy. However, since Church has shown that Carnap\u2019s notion\nof synonymy is incorrect (via an argument described in\n supplement E),\n we can safely omit the details of Carnap\u2019s notion for present\npurposes and speak simply in terms of synonymy. Now, according to\nCarnap\u2019s analysis, (2) is synonymous with\n\n(3)\nColumbus was disposed to an affirmative response to the English\nsentence \u201cthe world is round\u201d.\n\n\nThis is presumed true in virtue of Columbus\u2019 disposition to\naffirm, say, \u201cEl mundo es redondo\u201d or a\nsynonymous sentence in some other language (such as the English\nsentence \u201cThe earth is round\u201d).\n\nChurch suggested that the reader translate (2) and (3) into German\nmaking sure that, among other things, \u201cthat the world is\nround\u201d as it occurs in (2) is translated as \u201cdass die\nwelt rund ist\u201d, whereas \u201cthe world is round\u201d as\nit occurs in (3) is translated as \u201cthe world is round\u201d.\nThe difference is that the sentence \u201cthe world is round\u201d\nis mentioned in (3), whereas it is used in (2);\nmoreover, (3) does not mention the German sentence \u201cdie welt\nrund ist\u201d, only the English sentence \u201cthe world is\nround\u201d and so a proper translation of (2)\u2014one that\npreserves meaning (and not merely \u201cthe main\npoint\u201d)\u2014will mention the latter not the former. So, the\ntranslations are:\n\n(4)\nColumbus glaubte, dass die Welt rund ist\n(5)\nColumbus war bereit, den englischen Satze \u201cThe\nworld is round\u201d zu bejahen.\n\n\n(Notice that if we replace \u201cThe world is round\u201d in (5) by\nits German translation, the result is clearly false, since the German\ntranslation is not a sentence of English.)\n\nChurch concluded this version of CTA by noting that (4) and (5) are\nclearly not synonymous, since they convey different information to a\nGerman speaker who does not speak English. Church concluded that,\ntherefore, (2) and (3) are not synonymous (1951a [BE: 294]). Church\nassumed, plausibly, that synonymy is an equivalence\nrelation\u2014reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Hence, the basic\nstructure of CTA is as follows: Assume that (2) and (3) are\nsynonymous. Then (4) and (5) are synonymous. But (4) and (5) are not\nsynonymous, and so neither are (2) and (3), and therefore (3) cannot\nserve as an analysis of (2).\n\nHowever, Church argued that translation is not needed to establish\nthat (2) and (3) are not synonymous, and he gave another argument that\ndoes not appeal to translation:\n\n\nIt is not possible to infer [(2)] as a consequence of [(3)], on\nlogical grounds alone\u2014but only by making use of an item of\nfactual information not contained in [(3)], namely, that \u201cthe\nearth is round\u201d means in English that the earth is round. (1950a\n[BE: 280])\n\n\nThe point is that it is only a contingent fact about the English\nlanguage that the particular sequence of symbols and associated sounds\n\u201cthe earth is round\u201d mean in English that the earth is\nround. (Compare Church\u2019s summary of his argument where he says\nthat it is designed to \u201cdispel any remnants of an illusion that\nthere is something in some way necessary or transparent about the\nconnection between a word or sentence and its meaning, whereas, of\ncourse, this connection is entirely artificial and arbitrary\u201d\n(1951a [BE: 294]).) Moreover, this additional factual information is\nneeded to infer (2) from (3). For example, the language might have\ndeveloped in such a way that \u201cround\u201d and\n\u201csquare\u201d were interchanged, so that to say \u201cthe\nearth is square\u201d in this version of English is to say that the\nearth is round. Note that the following would nonetheless be true in\nthis new version of English:\n\n\n\u201cthe earth is square\u201d means that the earth is square,\n\n\nwhere the latter used occurrence of \u201cthe earth is\nsquare\u201d is a pronouncement of the new version of English, not\nthe familiar one. This shows that the aforementioned factual\ninformation is needed to infer (2) from (3), since otherwise the\nexpression \u201cthe earth is round\u201d need not represent\nColumbus\u2019 belief. This argument that CTA does not essentially\ninvolve translation is worth a closer look, since Church himself\ndescribes the argument as expressing \u201cthe main point\u201d he\nis trying make via CTA:\n\n\nThe main point is that [(3)] is inadequate as an analysis of [(2)]\nbecause it conveys less information than [(2)] does. (1950b [BE:\n1061]; cf. Salm\u00f3n 2001)\n\n\nThe information conveyed by (2) but not (3) is:\n\n(6)\n\u201cThe earth is round\u201d means in English that the earth\nis round.\n\n\nChurch claims that this is \u201can item of factual information not\ncontained in [(3)]\u201d, and it was Church\u2019s view that the\nword \u201cEnglish\u201d as commonly used contains \u201creference\nto matters of pragmatics\u201d (1950b [BE: 1060]). By this he meant\nthat the word \u201cEnglish\u201d means something like, as Church\nputs it, \u201cthe language that was current in the United States,\nCanada and Great Britain in 1949 AD\u201d, since it allows that\nEnglish is an evolving rather than a fixed system (1950). If so, it\nseems clear that the information given by [(2)] is not contained in\n[(3)] and that translation is not required to establish this.\n\nHowever, in a further twist, Carnap responds that\n\u201cEnglish\u201d as \\(he\\) intends it means something like\n\u201cthe unique language having such and such semantical\nrules\u201d and he brings this to Church\u2019s attention in his\nletter (1950b [BE: 1063]), thus challenging Church\u2019s claim that\n(5) is an item of factual information not contained in (3) but needed\nto infer (2) from (3). Church recognizes the threat:\n\n\nThe objection would then be less immediate that [(2)] is not a logical\nconsequence of [(3)] and it is possible that it would disappear.\n(1950a [BE: 280])\n\n\nThe point is that if English is defined to be the unique language with\nsuch and such semantical rules and (5) is one such rule, then it looks\nas though (2) would be a logical consequence of (3), so\ninterpreted.\n\nIn the last paragraph of (1950a), Church briefly states two arguments\nthat he obviously views as cementing the falsehood of Carnap\u2019s\nanalysis, even if English is taken to be the language with such and\nsuch fixed semantical rules. He first observes that if Carnap\u2019s\nproposal is discussed in German rather than English, then it will not\nbe synonymous with the English version! The one version involves an\nEnglish sentence while the other a German sentence. Church\u2019s\nassumption appears to be that a correct analysis of (2) should be\nlanguage independent. Next, he observes that even if (3) logically\nentails (2), a person might not see the entailment, and so not draw\nthe inference, leading her to believe (3) and yet not believe (2). Is\nChurch\u2019s assumption here that if (3) were a correct analysis of\n(2), then understanding and believing it should entail understanding\nand believing (2)? If so, this would conflict with Church\u2019s own\nway of dealing with the Paradox of Analysis. Moreover, there is\narguably an outright inconsistency between Church\u2019s solution to\nthis paradox and his solution to the Mates puzzle, which we discuss in\n supplement C.\n Church\u2019s criticism of Carnap\u2019s notion of synonymy is\ndiscussed in\n supplement E.\n",
