    "main_text": "The Logic of Action in Linguistics || Dynamic semantics\n2.3 Dynamic semantics\n\nThe idea that propositions can not only be viewed as state descriptions but also as updates has been advocated independently by many people. Consider the possible states of an agent to be (in the simplest case) a theory (that is, a deductively closed set of sentences). Then the update of a theory \\(T\\) by a proposition \\(\\phi\\) is the deductive closure of \\(T \\cup \\left\\{\\phi\\right\\}\\).\n\nG\u00e4rdenfors 1988 advocates this perspective with particular attention to belief revision. Veltman 1985 develops the update view for the treatment of conditionals. One advantage of the idea is that it is possible to show why the mini discourse \u201cIt rains. It may not be raining.\u201d is infelicitous in contrast to \u201cIt may not be raining. It rains.\u201d. Given that an update is felicitous only to a consistent theory, and that \u201cmay \\(\\phi\\)\u201d (with epistemic \u201cmay\u201d) simply means \u201cit is consistent\u201d (written \\(\\diamond\\phi\\)), the first is the sequence of updates with \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\diamond \\neg\\phi\\). The second step leads to inconsistency, since \\(\\phi\\) has already been added. It is vital in this approach that the context is constantly changing.\n\nHeim 1983 contains an attempt to make this idea fruitful for the treatment of presuppositions. In Heim\u2019s proposal, a sentence has the potential to change the context, and this is why, for example, the sentence \u201cIf John is married his wife will be happy.\u201d does not presuppose that John is married. Namely, the second part of the conditional (\u201chis wife will be happy\u201d) is evaluated against the context incremented by the antecedent (\u201cJohn is married\u201d). This of course is the standard way conditions are evaluated in computer languages. This parallel is exploited in Van Eijck 1994, see also Kracht 1993.\n\nThe idea of going dynamic was further developed in Dynamic Predicate Logic (DPL, see Groenendijk and Stokhof 1991), where all expressions are interpreted dynamically. The specific insight in this grammar is that existential quantifiers have a dynamically growing scope. This has first been noted in Kamp 1981, where a semantics was given in terms of intermediate representations, so-called Discourse Representation Structures. Groenendijk and Stokhof replace these structures by introducing a dynamics into the evaluation of a formula, as proposed in Dynamic Logic (DL). An existential quantifier is translated as a random assignment \u201c\\(x \\leftarrow\\ ?\\)\u201d of DL, whose interpretation is a relation between assignments: it is the set of pairs \\(\\langle \\beta ,\\gamma \\rangle\\) such that \\(\\beta(y) = \\gamma(y)\\) for all \\(y \\ne x\\) (in symbols \\(\\beta \\sim_x \\gamma\\)). The translation of the sentence \u201cA man walks.\u201d is \n\n(1)\n\n\\(\\langle x \\leftarrow ?\\rangle\n\\mathop{\\mathrm{man}}'(x) \\wedge \\mathop{\\mathrm{walk}}'(x)\\)\n\n\nThis is a proposition, hence interpreted as a set. One can however, push the dynamicity even lower, and make all meanings relational. Then \u201cA man walks.\u201d is interpreted by the \u2018program\u2019 \n\n(2)\n\n\\(x \\leftarrow ?; \\mathop{\\mathrm{man}}'(x)?; \\mathop{\\mathrm{walk}}'(x)?\\)\n  \n\nHere, \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{man}}'(x)?\\) uses the test constructor\n  \u201c\\(?\\)\u201d: \\(\\phi ?\\) is the set of all \\(\\langle \\beta ,\\beta \\rangle\\) such that \\(\\beta\\) satisfies \\(\\phi\\). The meaning of the entire program (2) therefore also is a relation between assignments. Namely, it is the set \\(R\\) of all pairs \\(\\langle \\beta ,\\gamma \\rangle\\) where \\(\\beta \\sim_x \\gamma\\), and \\(\\gamma(x)\\) walks and is a man. The meaning of (1) by contrast is the set of all \\(\\beta\\) such that some \\(\\langle \\beta ,\\gamma \\rangle \\in R\\). Existential quantifiers thus have \u2018side effects\u2019: the change in assignment is never undone by a quantifier over a different variable. Hence the open-endedness to the right of the existential. This explains the absence of brackets in (1). For an overview of dynamic semantics see Muskens et al. 1997.\n",
