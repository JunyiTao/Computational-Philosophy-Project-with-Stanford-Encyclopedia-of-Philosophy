How does one acquire such an obligation, and how many people\nhave really done what is necessary to acquire it? Or is a political\nobligation more a matter of being than of doing\n\u2013 that is, of simply being a member of the country or state in\nquestion? To those questions many answers have been given, and none\nnow commands widespread assent. Indeed, a number of contemporary\npolitical philosophers deny that a satisfactory theory of political\nobligation either has been or can be devised. Others, however,\ncontinue to believe that there is a solution to what is commonly\ncalled \u201cthe problem of political obligation,\u201d and they are\npresently engaged in a lively debate not only with the skeptics but\nalso with one another on the question of which theory, if any,\nprovides the solution to the problem.\n\nThe history of political thought is replete with attempts to provide a\nsatisfactory account of political obligation, from the time of\nSocrates to the present. These attempts have become increasingly\nsophisticated in recent years, but they have brought us no closer to\nagreement on a solution to the problem of political obligation than\nthe efforts of, say, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke in the seventeenth\ncentury. Nor have these sophisticated attempts made it unnecessary to\nlook back to earlier efforts to resolve the problem. On the contrary,\nan appreciation of the troublesome nature of political obligation\nrequires some attention to its place in the history of political\nthought.\n\nThis essay begins, therefore, with a brief history of the problem of\npolitical obligation. It then turns, in Part 2, to the conceptual\nquestions raised by political obligation, such as what it means for an\nobligation to be political. In Part 3 the focus is\non the skeptics, with particular attention to the self-proclaimed\nphilosophical anarchists, who deny that political obligations exist\nyet do not maintain that the state is necessarily unjustifiable. Part\n4 surveys the leading contenders among the various theories of\npolitical obligation now on offer, and Part 5 concludes the essay with\na consideration of recent proposals for pluralistic or \u201cmultiple\nprinciple\u201d approaches.\n", "toc": [{"#PolOblHisPer": "1.

Political Obligation in Historical Perspective\n\nThe phrase \u201cpolitical obligation\u201d is apparently no older\nthan T. H. Green\u2019s Lectures on the Principles of Political\nObligation, delivered at Oxford University in 1879\u201380\n(D\u2019Entr\u00e8ves, p. 3). The two words from which Green formed the\nphrase are much older, of course, and he apparently thought that\ncombining them required no elaborate explanation or defense. In any\ncase, there was nothing novel about the problem Green addressed in his\nlectures: \u201cto discover the true ground or justification for\nobedience to law\u201d (Green 1986, p. 13). Sophocles raised this\nproblem in his play Antigone, first performed around 440 BCE,\nand Plato\u2019s Crito recounts Socrates\u2019 philosophical response\nto the problem, in the face of his own death, some forty years\nlater.\n1.1 Socrates on Obeying the Law\n\nIn 399 BCE an Athenian jury found Socrates guilty of impiety and\ncorrupting the morals of the youth, for which crimes the jury\ncondemned him to death. According to Plato\u2019s account, Socrates\u2019\nfriends arranged his escape, but he chose to stay and drink the fatal\nhemlock, arguing that to defy the judgment against him would be to\nbreak his \u201cagreements and commitments\u201d and to\n\u201cmistreat\u201d his friends, his country, and the laws of\nAthens (Crito, 54c; Trial and Death, p. 54).\nSocrates\u2019 arguments are sketchy, and Crito, his interlocutor, does\nlittle to challenge them, but they are nevertheless suggestive of the\ntheories of political obligation that have emerged in the two and a\nhalf millennia since his death.\n\nThese arguments fall into at least four categories. First, Socrates\nmaintains that his long residence in Athens shows that he has entered\ninto an agreement with its laws and committed himself to obey them\n\u2013 an argument that anticipates the social contract or consent\ntheory of political obligation. Second, he acknowledges that he owes\nhis birth, nurture, and education, among other goods, to the laws of\nAthens. Together with the explicit analogy he draws between a\nfather\u2019s rightful claim to his children\u2019s obedience and\nAthens\u2019 rightful claim to her citizens\u2019 obedience, these\nobservations point toward a membership or associative account of\npolitical obligation. Third, Socrates appeals to what is now known as\nthe argument from fairness or fair play when he suggests that to\ndisregard his legal sentence would be to free-ride on his fellow\ncitizens, enjoying the benefits provided by their complying with the\nlaw while refusing to bear the cost of doing so himself. As he asks\nCrito, \u201cif we leave here without the city\u2019s permission,\nare we mistreating people whom we should least mistreat?\u201d (50a)\nFinally, there is a trace of utilitarian reasoning when Socrates\nimagines \u201cthe laws and the state\u201d confronting him with\nthis challenge: \u201cdo you think it possible for a city not to be\ndestroyed if the verdicts of its courts have no force but are\nnullified and set at naught by private individuals?\u201d (50b) None\nof these arguments is fully developed, but their presence in the\nCrito testifies to the staying power of intuitions and\nconcepts \u2013 commitment and agreement, gratitude, fair play, and\nutility \u2013 that continue to figure in discussions of obligation\nand obedience.\n\nPlato\u2019s Crito is noteworthy not only as the first\nphilosophical exploration of political obligation but also as the last\nto appear for centuries. To be sure, the Cynics and others did\nquestion the value of political life, and indirectly the existence of\nan obligation to obey the law, but they left no record of a discussion\nof the subject as sustained as even the five or six pages in the\nCrito. When the morality of obedience and disobedience next\nbecame a much discussed issue, it was a religious as much as a\nphilosophical discussion.\n1.2 Divine Command\n\nThroughout history, the belief that political society and its rules\nare divinely ordained has been so strong as to keep many people, and\nprobably most, from considering the possibility that disobeying those\nrules might ever be justified. With the advent of Christianity,\nhowever, that possibility had to be taken seriously. For the\nChristian, the distinction Jesus draws (Matthew 22:15\u201322)\nbetween the tribute owed to Caesar and that owed to God makes it clear\nthat what the rulers command may be at odds with what God wants done.\nThat point became even clearer when the rulers tried to suppress\nChristianity. Nevertheless, Christian doctrine held that there is an\nobligation to obey the law grounded in divine command, with the most\nimportant text being Paul\u2019s Epistle to the Romans (13:1\u20132):\n\u201cFor there is no authority except from God, and those that exist\nhave been instituted by God. Therefore he who resists the authorities\nresists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur\njudgment.\u201d\n\nAs a theory of political obligation, divine command faces two general\nproblems. First, it presupposes the existence of divinity of some\nsort; and second, the commands of the divine being(s) are not always\nclear. It is one thing to know that we should give to Caesar what is\nCaesar\u2019s and to God what is God\u2019s, for example, and quite another to\nknow what exactly is Caesar\u2019s due. For Christians, however, the main\nchallenge was to reconcile Paul\u2019s text with the uncomfortable fact\nthat rulers were often hostile to Christianity \u2013 or, with the\nrise of Protestantism in the sixteenth century, hostile to what one\ntook to be true Christianity. To this challenge, one response was\nsimply to hold that hostile or vicious rulers must be endured, for God\nmust have given them power as a sign of His displeasure with a wicked\npeople. Other responses, though, made room for disobedience.\n\nOne such response was to distinguish the divinely ordained office from\nthe officer who occupied it. That is, God ordains that political\nauthority must exist, because the condition of human life since the\nfall from grace requires such authority; but God does not ordain that\nthis or that particular person hold a position of authority, and He\ncertainly does not want rulers to abuse their authority by ruling\ntyrannically. This distinction, employed as early as the fourth\ncentury by St. John Chrysostom, was invoked throughout the middle ages\n(McIlwain, pp. 152\u201353). A second response to the problem Romans\n13 posed was to distinguish disobedience from resistance. According to\nMartin Luther and others who drew this distinction, Christians may not\nactively resist their rulers, but they must disobey them when the\nrulers\u2019 commands are contrary to God\u2019s. Yet a third response was to\nnote the possibility of conflict between two or more of one\u2019s rulers.\nIn other words, if more than one person holds political authority over\nyou, and if they issue conflicting commands, then you may satisfy\nPaul\u2019s injunction by obeying the authority whose commands are more\ncongenial to your understanding of true Christianity, even when such\nobedience entails resisting the commands of others in authority.\n\nThese last two responses played an especially important part in the\npolitical disputes that accompanied the Protestant Reformation. Under\nthe pressure of those disputes, however, another theory of political\nobligation became increasingly prominent, as Protestants came to rely\non the belief that political authority derives from the consent of the\ngoverned (Skinner, vol. 2, chaps. 7\u20139).\n1.3 The Social Contract\n\nAlthough the idea of the social contract long antedates the modern era\n(Gough 1967), its full development occurred in the seventeenth\ncentury, when Thomas Hobbes and John Locke used the theory to rather\ndifferent ends. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, and other\nphilosophers have also relied on social contract theory \u2013 in\nKant\u2019s case, in ways we will examine below (\u00a71.5) \u2013 but the\nclassic expressions of the contract theory of political obligation\nremain Hobbes\u2019s Leviathan (1651) and Locke\u2019s Second\nTreatise of Government (1690).\n\nFor Hobbes, social contract theory established the authority of anyone\nwho was able to wield and hold power. If we imagine ourselves in a\nstate of nature, he argued, with no government and no law to guide us\nbut the law of nature, we will recognize that everyone is naturally\nequal and independent. But we should also recognize that this state of\nnature will also be a state of war, for the \u201crestless desire\nfor Power after power\u201d that drives all of us will lead to\n\u201ca warre of every man against every man\u201d (Hobbes, chaps.\n11, 13). To escape so dreadful a condition, people surrender their\nindependence by entering into a covenant to obey a sovereign power\nthat will have the authority to make, enforce, and interpret laws.\nThis form of the social contract Hobbes called \u201csovereignty by\ninstitution.\u201d But he also insisted that conquerors acquire\nauthority over those they subject to their rule \u2013\n\u201csovereignty by acquisition\u201d \u2013 when they allow those\nsubjects to go about their business. In either case, Hobbes said, the\nsubjects consent to obey those who have effective power over them,\nwhether the subject has a choice in who holds power or not. Because\nthey consent, they therefore have an obligation to obey the sovereign,\nwhether sovereignty be instituted or acquired.\n\nExactly how much Locke differs from Hobbes in his conclusions is a\nmatter of scholarly dispute, but there is no doubt that he puts the\nsame concepts to work for what seem to be more limited ends. According\nto Locke, the free and equal individuals in the state of nature\nestablish government as a way of overcoming the\n\u201cinconveniencies\u201d of that state. Moreover, Locke\u2019s social\ncontract appears to have two stages. In the first stage the naturally\nfree and equal individuals agree to form themselves into a political\nsociety, under law, and in the second they establish the government.\nThis move allows Locke to argue, contrary to Hobbes, for a right of\nrevolution on the ground that overthrowing the government will not\nimmediately return the people to the state of nature. Nor does he\nhold, with Hobbes, that mere submission to a conqueror constitutes a\nform of consent to the conqueror\u2019s rule.\n\nLocke does agree with Hobbes, of course, in deriving obligations to\nobey the law from the consent of the governed. In developing his\nargument, however, he reveals several problems that have bedeviled\nsocial contract theory. One has to do with the nature of the contract:\nis it historical or hypothetical? If the former, then the problem is\nto show that most people truly have entered into such a contract (at\nleast if one\u2019s aim is to show that most people have a duty to\nobey the law). If the contract is meant to be a device that\nillustrates how people would have given their consent, on the\nother hand, then the difficulty is that a hypothetical contract\n\u201cis no contract at all\u201d (Dworkin, 1977, p. 151). Two more\nproblems concern how to characterize acts that count as consent.\nThough Hobbes maintains that submission to a conqueror qualifies as\nsuch an act, few are now likely to accept that agreement at the point\nof a sword gives rise to a moral obligation to obey (as opposed to a\nprudential reason to do so). Indeed, it is not clear that consent is\nreally the key to political obligation in Hobbes\u2019s theory;\nrather, we have an obligation to obey anyone who can maintain order.\nAs for Locke, he seems to stretch the notion of tacit consent too far\nwhen he states, in \u00a7119 of the Second Treatise, that the\n\u201cvery being of anyone within the territories\u201d expresses a\nperson\u2019s willing submission to the rule of its government.\n\nOne of the first to find fault with the argument from consent or\ncontract was David Hume. In \u201cOf the Original Contract,\u201d\npublished in 1752, Hume takes particular exception to the appeal to\ntacit consent. To say that most people have given their consent to\nobey the laws simply by remaining in their country of birth is\ntantamount to saying that someone tacitly consents to obey a\nship\u2019s captain \u201cthough he was carried on board while\nasleep and must leap into the ocean and perish the moment he leaves\nher\u201d (1953, p. 51). For Hume, the obligation to obey the law\nderives not from consent or contract but from the straightforward\nutility of a system of laws that enables people to pursue their\ninterests peacefully and conveniently.\n1.4 Utility and Obligation\n\nFor all its influence in other areas of legal, moral, and political\nphilosophy, utilitarianism has found few adherents among those who\nbelieve that there is a general obligation to obey the laws of one\u2019s\ncountry. Part of the reason for this situation may be the fact that\nJeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and others who followed Hume\u2019s path\nhad little to say about political obligation. A more powerful reason,\nthough, is that utilitarians have trouble accounting for obligations\nof any kind. If one\u2019s guiding principle is always to act to maximize\nexpected utility, or promote the greatest happiness of the greatest\nnumber, then obligations seem to have little or no binding force.\nAfter all, if I can do more good by giving the money in my possession\nto charity than by paying my debts, then that is what I should do,\nnotwithstanding my obligations to my creditors. By the same reasoning,\nwhether I should obey or disobey the law is a matter to be settled by\nconsidering which will do more good, not by determining whether I have\nan obligation to obey.\n\nSome utilitarian philosophers have struggled to overcome this problem,\neither by pointing to reasons to believe that respecting obligations\nserves to promote utility or by restricting calculations of utility to\nrules or norms rather than to individual acts (see the entry on\n\u201cconsequentialism\u201d for details). Whether their efforts\nhave been successful remains a matter of debate. There seems to be a\nconsensus, however, that the most sophisticated attempts to provide a\nutilitarian grounding for political obligation, such as those of Rolf\nSartorius (1975, chaps. 5 and 6) and R. M. Hare (1976), have proved\nunsuccessful (e.g., Simmons 1979, pp. 45\u201354; Horton 2010, pp.\n60\u201369). As a result, utilitarianism seldom figures in the\ndebates of those contemporary political philosophers who continue to\nbelieve that there is, in some political societies, a general\nobligation to obey the law.\n1.5 Kant on Legitimacy and Obligation\n\nIn contrast to utilitarianism, the practical philosophy of the\neighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant plays a major part\nin contemporary debates about political obligation. The proper\ndirection of his influence, however, is not altogether settled. On the\none hand, a leading \u201cphilosophical anarchist,\u201d Robert Paul\nWolff, claims Kantian inspiration for his a priori rejection of the\npossibility of political obligation (see \u00a73.1, below); on the\nother hand, important exponents of the \u201cnatural duty\u201d\napproach to the obligation to obey the law also claim to derive their\narguments from Kant (see \u00a74.4, below). Kant may bear some\nresponsibility for fostering these divergent responses, but it is safe\nto say that he himself was no anarchist, not even of the\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d sort. Indeed, he seems to insist on an\nunqualified obligation to obey the law that goes well beyond what any\npolitical philosopher nowadays will countenance.\n\nKant\u2019s theory employs the same basic concepts as Hobbes\u2019s\nand Locke\u2019s \u2013 natural (or innate) rights, the state of\nnature, and the social contract \u2013 but he puts them to different\nuse. In contrast to Hobbes, Kant looks upon the coercive force of the\nlaw not as a limitation on freedom but as the means of securing and\nextending it. In the state of nature, as he conceives of it,\nindividuals may enjoy \u201cwild, lawless freedom,\u201d but the\nthreats and constraints imposed by others prevent them from freely\nacting on their choices (1991 [1797], p. 127). Justified coercion\nunder law provides a remedy by impeding those who would interfere with\none\u2019s actions, thereby hindering the hindrances to freedom\n(Ripstein 2009, pp. 54\u201355 et passim). Moreover, unlike\nLocke\u2019s justification of the social contract as the way to\nsecure one\u2019s property and escape the\n\u201cinconveniencies\u201d of the state of nature, Kant takes the\n\u201ccivil condition\u201d produced by the social contract to be\nthe foundation that property rights and justice in general presuppose.\nThe social contract is thus not a matter of collective consent but a\nmoral imperative: \u201cWhen you cannot avoid living side by side\nwith all others, you ought to leave the state of nature and proceed\nwith them into a rightful condition, that is, a condition of\ndistributive justice\u201d (1991, pp. 121\u201322). \u201cProperly\nspeaking,\u201d Kant declares, the original contract is not an\nexpression of consent to be governed; it is \u201cthe Idea of this\nact, in terms of which alone we can think of the legitimacy of a\nstate\u201d (1991, p. 127).\n\nThe upshot, as noted above, is that everyone seems to have an absolute\nobligation to obey the laws of whoever is in authority; for even if\nthe ruler \u201cproceeds contrary to law \u2026 subjects may indeed\noppose this injustice by complaints \u2026 but not by\nresistance\u201d (1991, p. 130, emphasis in original; also pp.\n176\u201377). Kant\u2019s comments on this point are not\nunqualified, though. Among other things, he states that \u201cthe\nspirit of the original contract \u2026 involves an\nobligation on the part of the constituting authority to make the\nkind of government suited to the Idea of the original\ncontract\u201d; and he immediately adds that \u201cthe only\nconstitution that accords with right\u201d is \u201cthat of a pure\nrepublic\u201d \u2013 that is, \u201cthe constitution in which\nlaw itself rules and depends on no particular person\u201d\n(1991, p. 148, emphasis in original; for further discussion, see\nRipstein 2009, chap. 11). In any case, it is not so much Kant\u2019s\nconclusions as the foundations of his theory that have proved so\nimportant to contemporary discussions of political obligation.\n2. Conceptual Matters\n\nIn the twentieth century political philosophers devoted themselves at\nleast as much to the analysis of the problem of political obligation,\nand to the concepts it involves, as to full-scale attempts to devise\ntheories of the obligation to obey the law. Some even argued that the\nexistence of political obligations could be established by conceptual\nanalysis alone \u2013 a point we return to in section 3. More often\nphilosophers working in this vein sought to clarify what was at issue\nin the assertion or denial of political obligations, or duties to obey\nthe law.\n2.1 Obligation and Duty\n\nAs the previous sentence suggests, obligations are also duties. That\nis true, at any rate, when the obligation in question is political\nobligation. To be sure, some philosophers claim to have uncovered\ndifferences between obligations and duties, the most important of\nwhich is that obligations must be voluntarily undertaken or incurred,\nbut duties need not be (e.g., Brandt 1964; Hart 1958). The obligation\nto keep a promise or fulfill a contract, for example, arises only when\none has done something that generates the obligation \u2013 made a\npromise or signed a contract \u2013 but the duties of charity and\ntruth telling supposedly fall on us regardless of what, if anything,\nwe voluntarily commit to do. John Rawls relies on this distinction\nwhen he argues that most citizens of a reasonably just political\nsociety have no general obligation to obey its laws, even though they\ndo have a \u201cnatural duty\u201d to support just institutions\n\u2013 a duty he thinks has the general effect of requiring them to\nobey (Rawls 1999, p. 97). For the most part, however, the alleged\ndistinction between obligation and duty has played no significant role\nin the debates over the supposed moral responsibility to obey the law.\nTo invoke the distinction here would run counter to the tendency in\nboth ordinary language and contemporary philosophical discussion to\nuse the terms interchangeably, as when we speak of the\n\u201cduty\u201d to keep a promise or an \u201cobligation\u201d to\ntell the truth. This essay will proceed, then, like almost everything\nwritten on either side of the question, on the understanding that a\npolitical obligation, if it exists, is a moral duty to obey the law\n(but note the elaboration of this point in \u00a72.3).\n2.2 Obligation: Political, Legal, and Civil\n\nOne question that immediately arises from this conception of political\nobligation is whether \u201cpolitical\u201d is the appropriate\nmodifier. If the obligation in question is a duty to obey the law,\nthen why not call it a legal obligation? The answer is that\n\u201clegal obligation\u201d has a different kind of work to do. For\nmany legal philosophers, the claim that a person has a legal\nobligation to do X is merely a descriptive claim, a statement of\nsocial fact [see the entry on Legal Positivism]. The fact that a\nperson has a legal obligation to do X provides him with a moral reason\nto do X only if he has a moral duty obey the law; that is, a political\nobligation. The value of this distinction is that it allows one to\nhold that a person may be subject to a legal obligation even though\nshe has no political obligation to obey the laws of the regime in\npower. Suppose that the regime is tyrannical, inept, or simply so\nunjust that only a Hobbesian would maintain that those subject to its\ncommands have a moral obligation to obey. Nevertheless, most theorists\nwill agree that people in this unhappy country have legal obligations\nto pay taxes, refrain from certain types of conduct when driving, and\ndo whatever the legal system that enjoys de facto jurisdiction over\nthem requires; that is, claims to this effect are true descriptions of\nthe world. But such descriptions are compatible with the belief that\nthe people of unhappy countries have no moral duty to act as the law\ndirects simply because the law so directs.\n\nBhikhu Parekh (1993, p. 240) employs the phrase \u201ccivil\nobligation\u201d to refer to \u201cthe obligation to respect and\nuphold the legitimately constituted civil authority,\u201d from which\nfollows a moral obligation \u201cto obey the laws enacted by the\ncivil authority.\u201d \u201cPolitical\u201d is a broader term,\naccording to Parekh, and someone who has a truly political obligation\nwill owe her polity more than mere obedience to its laws, such as a\npositive duty to take steps to secure the safety and advance the\ninterests of her country. (see also Raz 2006, p. 1004). Yet we already\nhave a term, \u201ccivic duty,\u201d that does the work Parekh wants\nto assign to \u201cpolitical obligation.\u201d Exhortations to do\nour civic duty typically urge us to do more than merely obey the\nlaw. These exhortations would have us vote in elections and be\nwell-informed voters; buy government bonds; limit our use of water and\nother scarce resources; donate blood, service, or money (beyond what\nwe owe in taxes) in times of crisis; and generally contribute in an\nactive way to the common good. Whether we really have a civic duty to\ndo any or all of these things may be a matter of dispute, but appeals\nto civic duty are certainly quite common, and it is hardly clear that\nthere is something to be gained by reclassifying them as appeals to\npolitical obligation.\n\nWe now turn to the question of whether we should distinguish the\nconcept of political obligation from that of a duty to obey the law.\n The answer may depend on whether we understand the term\n\u201cpolitical\u201d to refer to the status in virtue of which a\nperson has the obligation or to the entity or agent to whom she owes\nit. In the former case, political obligation refers to those\nobligations a person has as a member or citizen of a particular\npolity. So understood, a theory of political obligation will tell us\nnothing about the authority a state enjoys over non-members; for\nexample, whether and why short-term visitors residing on its territory\nhave a duty to obey its laws. That need not render it defective as an\naccount of political obligation, but it does entail that we should not\ntake the phrase \u201cpolitical obligation\u201d to be synonymous\nwith the phrase \u201ca duty to obey the law\nsimpliciter,\u201d but only with the phrase \u201ca\ncitizen\u2019s (or member\u2019s) duty to obey the law.\u201d In\ncontrast, if \u201cpolitical\u201d refers to the agent or entity to\nwhom a person owes the obligation, then a theory of political\nobligation will be synonymous with a theory of the duty to obey the\nlaw, since it will aspire to explain why those who are subject to a\nparticular state\u2019s jurisdiction, be they citizens or foreigners,\nhave a moral duty to act as it directs them to act. Arguably, certain\nsolutions to the problem of political obligation fare better when\n\u201cpolitical\u201d refers to the status in virtue of which a\nperson has the obligation than when it refers to the entity to which\nshe owes it, or vice versa. For example, membership or associative\napproaches to political obligation may have a leg up in justifying\ncitizens\u2019 duties to obey the law but face a significant\nchallenge in accounting for the obligation of foreigners to do so (see\n\u00a74.3). Conversely, natural duty theories may be able to explain\nwhy anyone, citizen or not, has a duty to obey the law (i.e., the laws\nof one or another legal system) but struggle to explain why anyone has\na duty to obey the laws of the particular state of which she is a\nmember (see the discussion of particularity at the end of \u00a7 2.3;\nsee also \u00a74.4). Attention to the ambiguity in the referent of the\nterm \u201cpolitical\u201d may also support a pluralistic or\nmulti-principle solution to the problem of political obligation; e.g.,\na membership justification for the duty of citizens to obey the law,\nand a consent justification for the duty of foreigners to do so (see\n\u00a75).\n2.3 Obligation, Morality, and Practical Reason\n\nAs in the five historically significant theories surveyed in the\nprevious section, the presumption has continued to be that the answer\nto the problem of political obligation must be stated in moral terms.\nWhen T. H. Green set out in 1879 \u201cto discover the true ground or\njustification for obedience to law,\u201d for example, he was looking\nfor more than prudence alone can provide. \u201cYou ought to obey the\nlaw because you will suffer if you do not\u201d may be a powerful\nreason for obedience, but it is not a reason that speaks to\nGreen\u2019s concern with \u201cthe moral function or object served\nby law\u2026\u201d (1986, p. 13). For Green, and for almost\neveryone else who has pondered it, the problem of political obligation\nis a moral problem, and the obligation in question is a kind of moral\nobligation. To have a political obligation, then, is to have a moral\nduty to obey the law.\n\nMargaret Gilbert has recently challenged this moralized\ncharacterization of political obligation (Gilbert 2006; Gilbert 2013).\nShe maintains that a political obligation is a genuine obligation, by\nwhich she means that it provides a person subject to it with a\nsufficient, though not necessarily conclusive, reason for action that\ntrumps considerations of inclination or self-interest. However,\nGilbert distinguishes between two kinds of genuine obligations, or two\nsenses of the term \u201cobligation,\u201d the first synonymous with\nbeing the subject of a moral requirement and the second with\n\u201cowing\u201d something to another (2013, pp. 391\u20132).\nObligation in this second sense describes a normative relationship\nbetween two or more parties, one that can be created via a suitable\nact of will; for example, by what Gilbert calls an exercise of joint\ncommitment. It is the second sense of obligation that Gilbert\nmaintains we ought to employ in our analysis of the problem of\npolitical obligation, understood here as the challenge of accounting\nfor the obligations people owe one another as co-members of a given\npolity. That does not preclude the development of a theory concerning\nwhen moral requirements outweigh or defeat people\u2019s political\nobligations, of course. The theory of political obligation itself,\nhowever, ought to be de-moralized.\n\nOne upshot of Gilbert\u2019s account is that it entirely separates\nthe existence of political obligations from the justice or injustice\nof the political community\u2019s institutions and laws. On her\naccount, individuals can acquire genuine obligations in the sense of\nowing something to another even when their suitable act of willing is\ncoerced or the content of what they agree to owe another is immoral.\nWith respect to political obligation, then, neither state coercion\n(i.e., the absence of voluntary consent) nor the injustice of a\nstate\u2019s laws or institutions precludes its citizens\u2019\nacquisition of a genuine obligation to obey its laws. But why think\nthat a promise extracted at gun point generates any reason to do that\nwhich one promised, or that a voluntary agreement to torture babies\ngenerates a genuine (albeit not conclusive) obligation to do so? Or,\nif coerced or immoral owing-obligations are genuine but always\ndefeated or trumped by moral-requirement-obligations, one might wonder\nwhy we should posit their separate existence at all? One possibility\nis that doing so is necessary to render intelligible the response of\nthe promisee when the coerced promisor reneges on her promise; we can\nunderstand why the promisee feels betrayed even if we do not think he\nis justified in feeling that way. This response, however, treats\nGilbert\u2019s account of political obligation as an explanatory\ntheory, not a justificatory one (Lefkowitz 2007; for a response, see\nGilbert 2013, pp. 406\u20137).\n\nGilbert aside, theorists of political obligation characterize it as a\nmoral duty to obey the law. As such, it provides a person with a\ncategorical reason for action, one that does not depend on her\ninclinations or self-interest. Political obligation is also typically\nunderstood to be content-independent; that is, to be a duty\nto obey the law as such, or simply because it is the law [Hart 1982,\npp. 254\u201355]. Where a person has a duty to obey the law, the fact\nthat the law requires her to X suffices to provide her with a reason\nto X, independent of any judgment she may make regarding the merits of\nperforming X. The problem of political obligation, then, is not simply\nthe question of whether a person has a reason to do that which the law\nwould have her do. Often a person will have prudential reasons to do\nso, and she may have moral obligations to perform or not perform\nspecific acts independent of their being legally required or\nproscribed, as in the case of forbearing from murder. Rather, the\nquestion concerns the conditions, if any, in which the fact that the\nlaw requires a person to act thus-and-so imposes a moral obligation on\nher to act as the law directs. The content-independence of political\nobligation reflects the fact that what stands in need of justification\nis the polity\u2019s right to its subjects\u2019 obedience; to their\nacting as it directs because it so directs them.\n\nHow best to understand the content-independence of political\nobligation, and indeed, whether we ought to conceive of a duty to obey\nthe law in this way, remain live questions. For example, Stefan\nSciaraffa argues that in introducing the idea of content-independence,\nH.L.A. Hart relies on Paul Grice\u2019s distinction between natural\nand non-natural meaning. Statements with a non-natural meaning provide\nthose to whom they are addressed with a particular kind of reason to\nform some belief or perform some act A, namely the intention of the\nagent who uttered the statement that they form that belief or perform\nthat act. The phrase \u2018content-independent reason\u2019 is a\n(misleading) label for this particular kind of reason. Or as Sciaraffa\nputs the point, \u201can agent has a content-independent reason to\nphi if and only if someone\u2019s intent that she phi is a reason for\nher to phi\u201d (2009, p. 234). N.P. Adams counters that a reason is\ncontent-independent if and only if \u201cit has a container as a\nconstituent part and changing the content of that container does not\ndetermine whether the agent has that reason and does not determine the\nweight of that reason\u201d (2017, p. 149). Speech-acts such as\ncommands and promises are paradigmatic examples of containers. It is\nthe status of an agent as morally entitled to direct another to\nperform some act, apart from any other considerations that count in\nfavor of performing it, that provide the person so directed with a\nreason to perform that act. Sciaraffa and Adams draw on their\nrespective accounts of content-independence to offer rejoinders to\nPeter Markwick\u2019s criticisms of (a common interpretation of)\ncontent-independence (Markwick 2000). Laura Valentini maintains that\n\u201cif property P, invoked to justify the authority of law, is not\ndisplayed by legal commands robustly across variations in\ntheir content, then P cannot justify an obligation to obey the law\nbecause it is the law\u201d (2018, p. 141). She then argues that\nwhile certain common approaches to justifying political obligation,\nsuch as consent, can satisfy this understanding of\ncontent-independence, others, such as fair play, cannot. Finally,\nGeorge Klosko contends that we ought to reject altogether the claim\nthat political obligation is content-independent (Klosko 2011; see\nAdams, Valentini, for responses).\n\nHow can the state\u2019s mere willing that a person perform a certain\nact create a moral obligation to do so? One response is to construe\nthe successful exercise of practical authority not as the creation of\nmoral obligations ex nihilo but as a justified claim to\ndeference to the state\u2019s judgment regarding what its subjects\nhave independent reason to do. The characterization of this deference\nwithin a person\u2019s deliberation is a matter of some dispute. H.\nL. A. Hart and Joseph Raz, for example, argue that law is preemptive;\nlaw does not merely offer a consideration for or against a potential\ncourse of action, to be weighed against any and all other relevant\nconsiderations. Rather, law aims to exclude from an agent\u2019s\ndeliberation at least some of the considerations favoring or opposing\nthe conduct at issue, considerations that in the absence of the law it\nwould be permissible to take into account (Raz 1979, chaps. 1 and 2).\nRival views of the manner in which political obligation functions in a\nperson\u2019s deliberation reject the exclusionary element of\nRaz\u2019s account of the duty to obey the law, arguing that\npolitical obligations are simply weighty moral reasons that are\nbalanced against all of the other reasons a person has to perform or\nnot perform a given act (Perry 1989). On neither account, though, is a\nperson\u2019s political obligation taken to provide her with an\nabsolute duty to obey the law. Raz, for example, notes that law need\nnot exclude all of the first-order reasons a person might have for\nperforming a given act (1986, p. 46). Nor does he claim that the\nfirst-order reason the law provides for not performing a given act\nwill always outweigh or defeat non-excluded first-order reasons a\nperson has to perform that act. In other words, the duty to obey the\nlaw is a prima facie or pro tanto reason for action,\nfrom which it follows that the bearer of a political obligation may\nnot always have a conclusive or all-things-considered reason to act as\nthe law demands.\n\nTheorists of political obligation typically ascribe two further\nfeatures to the moral duty they seek to defend. First, the duty to\nobey the law is general both in the sense that it is a duty to obey\nthe entire body of law in a given jurisdiction and in the sense that\nthe duty is borne by all those living within that jurisdiction. Note\nthat a general moral duty to obey the law is consistent with variation\nin the legal obligations different subjects bear. For example, a given\nstate may impose on all and only its male citizens a duty to register\nfor a military draft, in which case the full set of legal obligations\nborne by men in this state will differ from the full set borne by\nwomen. Nevertheless, citizens of both sexes may be subject to a\ngeneral political obligation, meaning that they have a moral duty to\nfulfill all of their legal obligations. Raz, however, denies that the\nsubjects of any existing state or indeed anything remotely like it\nhave a general duty to obey the law; rather, law\u2019s authority is\npiecemeal, both with respect to who has a moral duty to obey a\nparticular law and with respect to the number of laws within a given\nlegal system that enjoy authority over anyone.\n\nThe second feature commonly ascribed to political obligations is that\nthey are typically conceived of as being owed only to the\nparticular political/legal society that claims primary or exclusive\njurisdiction over a person. Following John Simmons\u2019s influential\nanalysis, this has come to be known as \u201cthe particularity\nrequirement.\u201d Political obligation, Simmons maintains, carries\nan implicit connection to citizenship, which means that those who are\nengaged in the political obligation debate \u201care only interested\nin those moral requirements [including obligations and duties] which\nbind an individual to one particular political community, set\nof institutions, etc.\u201d (1979, p. 31; but cf. Edmundson 2004, p.\n232, and Walton, 2013). As indicated below, in \u00a74.4, the main\nobjection to natural duty theories of political obligation is that\nthey cannot account for this particularity.\n3. Anarchist Challenges to Political Obligation\n\nUntil recently, most political philosophers have assumed that subjects\nof a (moderately just) state have political obligations, while\ndisputing why that is so. Indeed, in the middle years of the twentieth\ncentury some philosophers even asserted, on conceptual grounds, that\npolitical obligation needs no justification. As one of them put the\npoint, \u201cto ask why I should obey any laws is to ask whether\nthere might be a political society without political obligations,\nwhich is absurd. For we mean by political society, groups of people\norganized according to rules enforced by some of their number\u201d\n(Macdonald 1951, p. 192; also McPherson 1967, p. 64, and, more subtly,\nPitkin 1966; but cf. Pateman 1973, and Horton 2010, pp. 138\u201346).\nThis view did not long prevail, but it testifies to the strength of\nthe tendency to believe that citizens surely have an obligation to\nobey the laws of their country, at least if it is reasonably just.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, however, skeptics have come to occupy a\nprominent place in debates over political obligation. As they see it,\nthere is no general obligation to obey the law, not even on the part\nof the citizens of a reasonably just polity. The most thorough-going\nof these dissenters have been anarchists proper \u2013 that is, those\nwho insist that states and governments are necessarily immoral\ninstitutions that ought to be abolished. Other skeptics or dissenters\nhave concluded, though, that the anarchist proper is wrong about the\nneed for the state but right about the lack of an obligation to obey\nthe law. Like the anarchist proper, these \u201cphilosophical\nanarchists\u201d hold that the state is illegitimate, but they deny\nthat its illegitimacy entails \u201ca strong moral imperative to\noppose or eliminate states; rather they typically take state\nillegitimacy simply to remove any strong moral presumption in favor of\nobedience to, compliance with, or support for our own or other\nexisting states\u201d (Simmons 2001, p. 104; but note Huemer 2013,\nwho regards philosophical anarchism as a second-best alternative that\ncould prepare the way for anarchism proper).\n3.1 Philosophical Anarchism\n\nThe arguments of these philosophical anarchists take either an\n\u201ca priori\u201d or an \u201ca posteriori\u201d form (Simmons\n2001, pp. 104\u2013106). Arguments of the first kind maintain that it\nis impossible to provide a satisfactory account of a general\nobligation to obey the law. According to Robert Paul Wolff, the\nprincipal advocate of this view, there can be no general obligation to\nobey the law because any such obligation would violate the\n\u201cprimary obligation\u201d of autonomy, which is \u201cthe\nrefusal to be ruled\u201d (1998 [1970], p. 18). As Wolff defines it,\nautonomy combines freedom with responsibility. To be autonomous,\nsomeone must have the capacity for choice, and therefore for freedom;\nbut the person who has this capacity also has the responsibility to\nexercise it \u2013 to act autonomously. Failing to do so is to fail\nto fulfill this \u201cprimary obligation\u201d of autonomy.\n\nThis primary obligation dooms any attempt to develop a theory of\npolitical obligation, Wolff argues, except in the highly unlikely case\nof a direct democracy in which every law has the unanimous approval of\nthe citizenry. Under any other form of government, autonomy and\nauthority are simply incompatible. Authority is \u201cthe right to\ncommand, and correlatively, the right to be obeyed\u201d (p. 4),\nwhich entails that anyone subject to authority has an obligation to\nobey those who have the right to be obeyed. But if we acknowledge such\nan authority, we allow someone else to rule us, thereby violating our\nfundamental obligation to act autonomously. We must therefore reject\nthe claim that we have an obligation to obey the orders of those who\npurport to hold authority over us and conclude that there can be no\ngeneral obligation to obey the laws of any polity that falls short of\na unanimous direct democracy.\n\nArguments of the second, a posteriori form are more modest in their\naims but no less devastating in their conclusions. In this case the\naim is not to show that a satisfactory defense of political obligation\nis impossible but that no defense has proven satisfactory, despite the\nefforts of some of the best minds in the history of philosophy. All\nsuch attempts have failed, according to those who take this line, so\nwe must conclude that only those relatively few people who have\nexplicitly committed themselves to obey the law, perhaps by swearing\nallegiance as part of an oath of citizenship, have anything like a\ngeneral obligation to obey the laws under which they live (e.g., Smith\n1973; Raz 1979, chap. 12; Simmons 1979, 2001, chap. 6, and 2005; Green\n1988, pp. 220\u201347, and 1996).\n3.2 Against Philosophical Anarchism\n\nWhether a priori or a posteriori, the arguments of the philosophical\nanarchists pose a serious challenge to those who believe in a general\nobligation to obey the law. This challenge is made especially\ndifficult by the powerful objections that Simmons and other a\nposteriori anarchists have brought against the existing theories of\npolitical obligation. The most effective response, of course, would be\nto demonstrate that one\u2019s favored theory does not succumb to\nthese objections, and we shall briefly consider attempts to respond in\nthis fashion in \u00a74, below. Some general attempts to refute\nphilosophical anarchism ought to be noted first, however.\n\nSome of these attempts apply specifically to Wolff\u2019s a priori\nattack on political authority and obligation, and others apply to\nphilosophical anarchism in general. The arguments against Wolff\nusually concentrate on his conception of autonomy and its relation to\nauthority. In brief, Wolff\u2019s critics argue that he is wrong to\ninsist that moral autonomy is our \u201cprimary\u201d or\n\u201cfundamental obligation,\u201d for it \u201cis, in fact,\nhighly implausible to think that autonomy should invariably override\nall other values\u201d (Horton, p. 127). Moreover, there is no reason\nto accept Wolff\u2019s claim that autonomy and authority are\nnecessarily incompatible. Insofar as autonomy is a capacity, as Wolff\nsays, it will need to be developed before it can be exercised, and\nvarious kinds of authority \u2013 including political authority\n\u2013 will foster its development and make its continued exercise\npossible (Dagger 1997, pp. 66\u201368). Nor is it clear how Wolff can\nreject political authority without also rejecting promises and\ncontracts as illegitimate constraints on one\u2019s autonomy \u2013\na problem that leads even Simmons to declare Wolff\u2019s a priori\nanarchism a \u201cfailed attempt\u201d (2001, p. 111).\n\nIn the face of these problems, Matthew Noah Smith has recently tried\nto rescue the a priori skepticism of Wolff\u2019s theory by\nsubstituting the overriding importance of \u201cthe moral status of\nthe subject\u2019s self\u201d (2011, p. 2) for Wolff\u2019s\nreliance on the fundamental duty of autonomy. According to Smith,\npreserving the status of the self is incompatible with the law\u2019s\nclaim to authority, because \u201cthe obligation to obey the law\nwould morally require otherwise morally upstanding subjects to undergo\na radical form of self-effacement in favor of recreating themselves in\nthe image of foreign values\u201d (p. 2; see p. 9 for an admittedly\n\u201cflorid\u201d way of making this point). Whether the law is\nproperly understood as an \u201calien force\u201d that threatens\n\u201cto fix who one is\u201d (p. 14), however, is a point that\ncritics of a priori anarchism are not likely to concede. Indeed, the\nradically individualistic conception of the self that underpins\nSmith\u2019s argument is one that proponents of the membership or\nassociative theory of political obligation (see \u00a74.3, below) will\ndismiss from the outset. It seems unlikely, then, that Smith\u2019s\nadaptation will develop the \u201ctraction\u201d that, on his\naccount, Wolff\u2019s has failed to gain.\n\nWith regard to philosophical anarchism in general, critics have\nresponded in various ways, including the disparate complaints that it\nis a kind of false or hypocritical radicalism (Gans) and that it is\nall too genuine a threat to political order (Senor). The latter\ncomplaint has both an ontological and a conceptual aspect. That is,\nthe critics argue that philosophical anarchists fail to appreciate the\nsocial or embedded nature of human beings, which leads the anarchists\nto conceive of obligation in excessively individualistic or\nvoluntaristic terms \u2013 and that leads, in turn, to their denial\nof a general obligation to obey the law. The problem, however, is that\nit is a mistake to think \u201cthat political life can be left more\nor less unchanged by dispensing with some conception of political\nobligation and adopting the perspective of philosophical anarchism.\nUnless it can be shown that we can continue to talk intelligibly and\ncredibly of our government or our state, then a root\nand branch reimagining of our political relations would appear to be a\nnecessary consequence\u201d (Horton 2010, p. 133; emphasis in\noriginal). Whether the philosophical anarchists should welcome that\nconsequence, or whether they can find a way to stop short of it, thus\nbecomes a major point of contention.\n\nIn the end, of course, the best response to philosophical anarchists,\nespecially those of the a posteriori kind, will be to produce or\ndefend a theory of political obligation that proves immune to their\nobjections. At present, though, no single theory has the support of\nall of those who continue to believe in political obligation, let\nalone the clear prospect of converting philosophical anarchists.\nSeveral theories remain in contention, however, as the following\nsection indicates.\n4. Contemporary Theories of Political Obligation\n\nAlthough the lines that separate one theory from another are not\nalways distinct, philosophical justifications of political obligation\nnowadays usually take the form of arguments from consent, fair play,\nmembership, or natural duty. Some philosophers advance a hybrid of two\nor more of these approaches, and others hold, as the concluding\nsection shows, that a pluralistic theory is necessary. For the most\npart, though, attempts to justify a general obligation to obey the law\nfollow one of these four lines of argument.\n4.1 Consent\n\nMost people who believe that they have an obligation to obey the law\nprobably think that this putative obligation is grounded in their\nconsent. Political philosophers are less inclined to think this way,\nhowever, in light of the withering criticism to which Hume and more\nrecent writers \u2013 notably Simmons (1979, chaps. 3 and 4) \u2013\nhave subjected consent theory. The critics\u2019 claim is not that\nconsent cannot be a source of obligations, for they typically believe\nthat it can. Their claim, instead, is that too few people have either\nexpressly or tacitly given the kind of actual consent that can ground\na general obligation to obey the law, and hypothetical consent cannot\nsupply the defect, for reasons already noted.\n\nNevertheless, consent theory still has its adherents among political\nphilosophers. Their versions of consent theory vary considerably,\nthough, with two main branches emerging in response to the criticisms.\nOne response, advanced by Harry Beran (1987), accepts the claim that\nonly express consent can generate a political obligation, but then\ncalls for political societies to establish formal procedures for\nevoking such consent. That is, states should require their members\nopenly to undertake an obligation to obey the law or to refuse to do\nso. Those who decline the obligation will then have the options of\nleaving the state, seceding to form a new state with like-minded\npeople, or taking residence in a territory within the state reserved\nfor dissenters. In the absence of such procedures, it seems that\nBeran\u2019s position is roughly the same as that of the a posteriori\nphilosophical anarchist. Were the procedures he recommends in place,\nthough, it is far from clear that the options available to the members\nwill make their \u201cconsent\u201d truly voluntary (Klosko 2005,\npp. 123\u201329; Horton, pp. 34\u201336).\n\nThe second line of response to the criticisms of consent theory is to\nargue in one way or another that the critics construe\n\u201cconsent\u201d too narrowly. Thus John Plamenatz (1968,\n\u201cPostscript\u201d) and Peter Steinberger (2004, p. 218) have\nmaintained that voting or otherwise participating in elections should\ncount as consent; and Steinberger produces a lengthy list of fairly\nordinary activities \u2013 calling the police or fire department for\nhelp, sending children to a public school, using a public library, and\nmore \u2013 that constitute \u201cactive participation in the\ninstitutions of the state\u201d (pp. 219\u201320). Mark Murphy and\nMargaret Gilbert have sounded variations on this theme by arguing, in\nMurphy\u2019s case, that \u201csurrender of judgment is a kind of\nconsent\u201d (in Edmundson 1999, p. 320), or, in Gilbert\u2019s,\nthat \u201cjoint commitment\u201d is an important source of\nobligations, including political obligations (1993, 2006, 2013). For\nMurphy, surrender of judgment is consent in the usual sense of\nvoluntary agreement or acceptance. As he says, \u201cOne consents to\nanother in a certain sphere of conduct in the acceptance sense of\nconsent when one allows the other\u2019s practical judgments to take\nthe place of his or her own with regard to that sphere of conduct.\n(This consent may be either to a person or to a set of rules: both of\nthese can be authoritative)\u201d (p. 330). As the earlier discussion\nof her ideas indicates (\u00a72.3), Gilbert differs from Murphy, and\nothers, in taking a joint commitment to be something that need not\narise voluntarily. According to her theory, \u201can understanding of\njoint commitment and a readiness to be jointly committed are necessary\nif one is to accrue political obligations, as is common knowledge of\nthese in the population in question. One can, however, fulfill these\nconditions without prior deliberation or decision, and if one has\ndeliberated, one may have had little choice but to incur them\u201d\n(2006, p. 290). Indeed, membership in a \u201cplural subject\u201d\nformed through non-voluntary joint commitments plays such a large part\nin Gilbert\u2019s theory that it may be better to place her with\nthose who advocate an \u201cassociative\u201d or\n\u201cmembership\u201d theory of political obligation than with\nadherents of consent theory.\n\nDavid Estlund (2008, pp. 117\u201358) has recently offered a new\ntwist on consent theory. Most theorists maintain that putative acts of\nconsent are void if it would be wrong to consent to another\u2019s\nauthority. For example, consent to be another\u2019s slave generates\nno obligation even if it genuinely expresses a person\u2019s will.\nEstlund argues on grounds of symmetry that we ought to draw the same\nconclusion in cases where it would be wrong not to consent to\nanother\u2019s authority. Such failures are void, and so a person who\nmorally ought to have consented to another\u2019s authority has a\nduty to obey her. If subjects of a given state ought to consent to\nobey its laws, say because the state performs morally necessary tasks,\nthen their failure to do so is void and no barrier to concluding that\nthey are under a political obligation to that state. Estlund\u2019s\ndefense of what he labels normative consent is subtle and\nsophisticated. Still, one might wonder whether in cases where\nnon-consent is void the duty to submit to another\u2019s authority\nfollows directly from the considerations in virtue of which it is\nwrong for someone not to consent (see Sreenivasan 2009). It is also\nunclear whether there is enough of a connection between the\nagent\u2019s will and her coming to be subject to another\u2019s\nauthority to warrant classifying Estlund\u2019s account as an example\nof consent theory (for responses to both concerns, see Estlund 2008,\npp. 127\u2013131; 2009).\n4.2 Fair Play\n\nAlthough earlier philosophers, including Socrates, appealed to\nsomething resembling the principle of fairness (or fair play), the\nclassic formulation of the principle is set out in H. L. A.\nHart\u2019s \u201cAre There Any Natural Rights?\u201d As Hart there\nsays, \u201cwhen a number of persons conduct any joint enterprise\naccording to rules and thus restrict their liberty, those who have\nsubmitted to these restrictions when required have a right to a\nsimilar submission from those who have benefited by their\nsubmission\u201d (1955, p. 185). John Rawls subsequently adopted this\nprinciple in an influential essay of his own, referring to the duty\nderived from the principle as the \u201cduty of fair play\u201d\n(1964). What the principle of fair play holds, then, is that everyone\nwho participates in a reasonably just, mutually beneficial cooperative\npractice \u2013 Hart\u2019s \u201cjoint enterprise according to\nrules\u201d \u2013 has an obligation to bear a fair share of the\nburdens of the practice. This obligation is owed to the others who\ncooperate in the enterprise, for cooperation is what makes it possible\nfor any individual to enjoy the benefits of the practice. Anyone who\nacts as a free rider is acting wrongly, then, even if his or her\nshirking does not directly threaten the existence or success of the\nendeavor. Those who participate in the practice thus have rights\nagainst as well as obligations to one another: a right to require\nothers to bear their share of the burdens and an obligation to bear\none\u2019s share in turn.\n\nThe principle of fair play applies to a political society only if its\nmembers can reasonably regard it as a cooperative enterprise that\nworks to their mutual benefit. If it can, the members have an\nobligation of fair play to do their part in maintaining the\nenterprise. Because the rule of law is necessary to the maintenance of\nsuch a polity \u2013 and perhaps even constitutive of it \u2013 the\nprincipal form of cooperation is abiding by the law. In the absence of\noverriding circumstances, then, the members of the polity qua\ncooperative practice must honor their obligation to one another to\nobey the laws. In this way the principle of fair play provides the\ngrounding for a general obligation to obey the law, at least on the\npart of those whose polity they can reasonably regard as a cooperative\nenterprise.\n\nThe argument from fair play has met with serious criticism, however.\nThe most sweeping is that of Robert Nozick, who objects that the\nprinciple of fair play would allow others to place us under an\nobligation to them simply by conferring benefits on us (1974, pp.\n90\u201395). To make his point, Nozick imagines a group of neighbors\ncreating a public entertainment system and assigning every adult in\nthe neighborhood a day on which he or she is responsible for planning\nand broadcasting a program. As a resident of the neighborhood, you\noccasionally hear and enjoy the programs, but you never consent to\ntake part in this scheme. When your assigned day arrives, are you\nobligated to take a turn? The principle of fair play says yes,\naccording to Nozick, but the correct answer to the question is\n\u201csurely not.\u201d\n\nAccording to a second objection, fair-play considerations apply only\nto cooperative schemes that produce benefits one may refuse. If it\nproduces nonexcludable goods, which everyone receives regardless of\nwhether she contributed to their production or even wants them, then\nthere can be no fair-play obligation to bear a share of the burdens of\nthe enterprise. But this is typically the case in political societies,\nwhich produce goods such as public order and national defense that one\ncannot meaningfully refuse to accept. As Simmons puts it (1979, p.\n129), there is a difference between receiving and\naccepting benefits, and receiving them is not enough to place\nsomeone under an obligation. If there is a political obligation,\ntherefore, it does not follow directly from the existence of the kind\nof nonexcludable goods that states provide. To be sure, Simmons does\nacknowledge that some people may acquire fair-play obligations by\nenjoying nonexcludable benefits that they take to be \u201cworth the\nprice [they] pay for them\u201d if they do so in full awareness that\n\u201cthe benefits are provided by a cooperative\nscheme\u201d (1979, p. 132; emphasis in original). But he also\nmaintains that few people will satisfy both of these conditions, with\nthe second proving especially troublesome for advocates of fair-play\ntheory: for \u201ceven in democratic political communities, these\nbenefits are commonly regarded as purchased (with taxes) from a\ncentral authority, rather than as accepted from the cooperative\nefforts of our fellow citizens\u201d (1979, p. 139).\n\nAs one might expect, advocates of the fair-play account have not\nremained silent in the face of these criticisms. The leading advocate,\nGeorge Klosko, has written two books elaborating and defending the\nprinciple of fairness as the foundation of political obligation (2004\n[1992], 2005), and it sometimes seems that every fresh attack on fair\nplay provokes a swift response (e.g., Carr 2002 and Lefkowitz 2004;\nZhu 2014 and Tosi 2017). And the attacks have certainly continued\n(e.g., Simmons 2001, chap. 2; McDermott 2004), as we shall indicate\nshortly. First, though, it is necessary to see how fair-play advocates\nhave responded to the criticisms sketched above.\n\nWith regard to Nozick\u2019s objection, the response is usually to\nhold that his example of the neighborhood entertainment system is\nbeside the point (Bell 1978). That is, Nozick is probably right to say\nthat one would have no obligation to operate the system on his or her\nassigned day, but he is wrong to think that fair play would require\none to do so. There is no fair-play obligation in cases such as this,\neither because the passive receipt of benefits is not enough to show\nthat one is a participant in a cooperative practice (Dagger\n1997, pp. 69\u201370) or because the benefits are \u201cof\nrelatively little value\u201d (Klosko 2004, pp. 38\u201339:).\nResponses to Simmons\u2019 objections have taken two directions. One\nis to say that Simmons has drawn too sharp a distinction between the\nacceptance and receipt of benefits. Between the person who passively\nreceives the benefits of a cooperative practice and the one who\nknowingly and willingly accepts them is the person \u2013 very many\npeople, in fact \u2013 who actively participates in the practice\nwithout being fully aware, in the ordinary course of life, that she is\nundertaking an obligation to do her part in a cooperative practice\n(Dagger 1997, pp. 73\u201378; Besson 2005, pp. 487\u201389). Others\nrespond to Simmons\u2019 criticism by denying that obligations must\nbe incurred voluntarily (Arneson 1982; Klosko 2004, pp. 39\u201357 ).\nWhat matters is not that one accepts the benefits of the practice,\naccording to Klosko\u2019s influential account, but that three\nconditions are met: \u201cGoods supplied must be (i) worth the\nrecipients\u2019 effort in providing them; (ii) \u2018presumptively\nbeneficial\u2019; and (iii) have benefits and burdens that are fairly\ndistributed\u201d ( 2004, p. 39 ). If, in sum, a state qualifies as a\ncooperative enterprise, and if it provides its members with goods that\nare presumptively beneficial \u2013 or \u201cindispensable for\nsatisfactory lives\u201d (Klosko 2005, p. 6) \u2013 then its members\nhave an obligation grounded in fairness to obey its laws.\n\nThese responses have not settled the debate in favor of a fair-play\naccount of political obligation. Simmons, for example, continues to\nhold that modern political societies are too large and impersonal to\ncount as cooperative enterprises (2001, pp. 38\u201342). He also\ncontends that Klosko\u2019s theory is \u201cnot really a\nfairness theory at all,\u201d but a \u201cdisguised Natural\nDuty theory, resting on an unstated moral duty to help supply\nessential goods locally \u2026\u201d (2005, p. 190, emphasis in\noriginal; also 2007, pp. 22\u201323). Others complain that fair-play\ntheory is not suitably sensitive to the possible alternatives there\nmay have been to the cooperative practices that have emerged. We may\nadmit, on this view, that people receive benefits from a cooperative\npractice, and even net benefits, but we should also notice that they\nmight have benefited more from the establishment of a different\npractice. To say, in these circumstances, that those who are engaged\nin a cooperative practice have an obligation to do their part is to\naccept the principle of fairness as \u201ca powerfully conservative\nprinciple\u201d (Normore 2010, p. 231). Yet having a fair-play\nobligation to the members of an ongoing enterprise does not bar anyone\nfrom trying to transform that enterprise, perhaps even by means of\ncivil disobedience (see the entry on Civil Disobedience).\n\nIn the political context, according to another critic, the proper\ncomparison is between a state of affairs in which benefits follow from\nother people\u2019s obeying the laws in the sense of mere compliance,\non the one hand, and a situation in which benefits follow from\nothers\u2019 obeying \u201cbecause the law says to do\nit\u201d (Durning 2003, p. 255). If the benefits are the same in both\ncases, then there is no reason to think that true cooperation, rather\nthan mere compliance, is producing the benefits, and hence no reason\nto think that those who receive the benefits have a fair-play\nobligation to obey the laws. This argument seems likely to do no more\nthan renew controversies about the nature of such societies and the\nviability of philosophical anarchism. The question is whether we can\nexpect a polity to survive if its \u201cmembers\u201d regard one\nanother not as cooperators in a common enterprise but exclusively as\npurchasers of governmental services who comply with the law under the\nthreat of coercion.\n4.3 Membership or Association\n\nRecent decades have witnessed a resurgence of arguments in defense of\nan associative account of political obligation. Associative\nobligations are ones that agents are alleged to have merely in virtue\nof their occupying a role in some socially salient relationship, such\nas being a parent, a friend, or a doctor. These roles are at least\npartly constituted by the various obligations their occupants owe to\nthe other(s) in the relationship; to be X\u2019s parent or Y\u2019s\nfriend just is to have certain duties to X or Y (as well as certain\nclaims against them). Exactly what those obligations are varies\nsomewhat depending on the relationship in question and the society in\nwhich the participants in that relationship are embedded. These\nvariations reflect different conceptions of the relationship\u2019s\nvalue or purpose, or of the particular obligations that follow from a\nspecific conception. Whatever their number and content, associative\nobligations are owed only to particular others, namely those with whom\nan agent has a certain kind of relationship, rather than being owed\nuniversally to all moral agents or sentient beings in virtue of their\nstatus as such.\n\nSince associative obligations attach to an agent simply in virtue of\nher occupying a role in a particular relationship, it makes no\ndifference whether she comes to occupy that role voluntarily, as in\nthe case of professional relationships and most friendships, or\nnon-voluntarily, as in the case of sibling relationships or, in many\ncases, citizenship. As these examples suggest, occupying roles in\nvarious types of relationships often figures centrally in\npeople\u2019s identity. In part, this is a matter of people\u2019s\nself-conception; many of us strongly identify with our role as\nparents, children, siblings, friends, teachers, members of specific\nreligious communities, and so on. Some proponents of associative\nobligations advance a stronger claim, however. Human beings are not\nessentially unencumbered individuals who can move in and out of\nvarious roles while remaining the same person; rather, we are all\nembedded in a web of normative relationships, some of which we cannot\nexit without being \u201creborn\u201d as radically different\npeople.\n\nAn associative account of political obligation has many attractive\nfeatures. It provides a justification for a duty to obey the law that\ndoes not depend on an individual\u2019s choice or voluntary exercise\nof will \u2013 surely a virtue when so many people have not consented\nto be ruled by the state that governs them, or to be a member of the\npolitical community on whose behalf it does so. The particularity of\npolitical obligation \u2013 again, the fact that it is owed to the\nparticular political community to which an agent belongs \u2013\nfollows straightforwardly from its nature as an associative\nobligation. So, too, does the claim that political obligation requires\nobedience to law. As Samuel Scheffler observes,\n\u201cmembership-dependent reasons are reasons for doing one\u2019s\nshare, as defined by the norms and ideals of the group itself, to help\nsustain it and contribute to its purposes\u201d (2018, p. 17). Law\nspecifies, perhaps incompletely, what counts as doing one\u2019s\nshare. John Horton makes the same point when he writes that laws\n\u201cdefine the terms of association within a polity, [and] concern\nfor the interests and welfare of the polity is a concern for these\nterms of association\u201d (1992, p. 165). Finally, many people\napparently think of themselves as members of political societies, and\nin virtue of that fact, believe that they have an obligation to obey\nits laws. To pay one\u2019s taxes, to vote, to serve on a jury or in\nthe armed forces, to coordinate with other members of one\u2019s\npolity to ensure a safe environment, and so on, is simply to fulfill\nthe obligations of citizenship. An associative account of political\nobligation captures this (allegedly) widespread sense that \u201cdeep\nand important obligations flow from identity and relatedness\u201d\n(Tamir 1993, p. 99).\n\nLike the other theories of political obligation, associative accounts\nhave met with considerable criticism. One line of attack targets the\nparallels many of its proponents draw between the family and the\npolity. In Ronald Dworkin\u2019s words, \u201cpolitical association,\nlike family and friendship and other forms of association more local\nand intimate, is in itself pregnant of obligation\u201d (1986, p.\n206). John Horton invokes further analogs between family and polity in\nhis argument for associative political obligation:\n\n\nMy claim is that a polity is, like the family, a relationship into\nwhich we are mostly born, and that the obligations which are\nconstitutive of the relationship do not stand in need of moral\njustification in terms of a set of basic moral principles or some\ncomprehensive moral theory. Furthermore, both the family and the\npolitical community figure prominently in our sense of who we are: our\nself-identity and our understanding of our place in the world (1992,\npp. 150\u201351).\n\n\nWhile some critics contest the existence of associative obligations\neven among family members (Wellman 1997), others acknowledge their\nexistence but maintain that they depend on a degree of intimacy and\nemotional connection absent from the relationship between citizens of\na modern state. As Diane Jeske writes: \u201c[A]ll of the features of\nintimate relationships that seem morally significant \u2013 the\nmutual emotions and attitudes of the parties to each other as\nindividuals, the personal interaction, the mutual knowledge and\nunderstanding of each other\u2019s character \u2013 must be ignored\nin the grounding of associative [political] obligations. [I]f the\nrelationships that ground associative obligations are to include\npolitical relations, the notion of a relationship has to be stretched\nbeyond recognition\u201d (2001, p. 38; see also Simmons 1996; Wellman\n1997; Dagger 2000). Advocates of associative political obligation\noffer two (complementary) responses. First, some contend that citizens\nof modern states can and do care for their fellow citizens and the\nhealth of their common political community, even if their\nrelationships with one another do not approximate the intimacy we find\nin a (healthy) nuclear family. The concern for one\u2019s polity, and\nits present, past, and future members, reflects the special\nrelationship one bears to them, and therefore differs from the concern\na person may have for all moral agents or sentient beings as such.\nSecond, we should not assume that a relationship must be characterized\nby intimacy or specific types of emotional connection in order to have\nthe sort of value that can justify associative obligations (Horton and\nWindeknecht 2015, p. 907, Scheffler 2018, p. 10). Even if intimacy is\na necessary condition for realizing the good of friendship, and love a\nnecessary condition for realizing the non-instrumental value of the\nparent-child relationship, it does not follow that they are necessary\nfor achieving the (non-instrumental) value of political\nassociation.\n\nNevertheless, defenders of an associative account of political\nobligation owe their interlocutors an account of what makes political\nassociation valuable. The emphasis these theorists have placed on\nmembership or association as the ground of political obligation,\nwhilst giving relatively little attention to what makes it valuable,\nhas invited the following objection: if membership is sufficient to\ngenerate an obligation to obey, then the members of unjust and\nexploitative groups will have an obligation to obey the rules. In the\ncase of the polity, this leads to the unpalatable and\ncounter-intuitive conclusion that the routinely exploited and\noppressed \u201cmembers\u201d of an unjust polity are under an\nobligation to obey its laws (Dagger 2000; 2018, p. 89).\n\nThe obvious rejoinder is to deny that unjust associations have the\nsort of value that can ground associative obligations, or at least\nthat this is so for those \u201cmembers\u201d who are routinely\nexploited and oppressed. Thus, John Horton develops a two-pronged\naccount of associative political obligation according to which a\npolity must provide its citizens \u201cthe generic good of order\nand security\u201d and its members must identify with it and\nacknowledge its political authority (Horton 2010). Similarly,\nScheffler maintains that \u201cthe value of one\u2019s membership is\nnot independent of the nature of the society or the justice of its\ninstitutions,\u201d (2018, p. 14) while Ronald Dworkin holds that\nassociative political obligations arise only among members of a\ncommunity of principle, one committed to the treatment of all its\nmembers with equal concern and respect (1986, pp. 213\u2013215).\nWhereas these rejoinders all make associative political obligations\nconditional on the polity adequately satisfying certain substantive\nmoral standards, Massimo Renzo sketches a response that focuses\ninstead on what makes a person a member of a political society. His\nanswer is a \u201cquasi-voluntarist reformulation of the associative\nmodel\u201d which holds that we voluntarily occupy our roles even in\nfamilies and polities as long as \u201cwe could have stepped out of\nthem if we had wanted\u201d (2012, p. 109, p. 120). Oppressed\n\u201cmembers\u201d of a polity have no associative obligations, at\nleast if stepping out of their role as \u201cmembers\u201d is not an\noption available to them at a reasonable cost.\n\nCritics maintain that in offering responses like those just described,\nassociative theorists effectively abandon their attempt to provide a\ndistinctive account of political obligation (Dagger 2018, p.\n79\u201382; Wellman 2000, p. 553; Simmons 2001, pp. 83\u201384;\n2005, pp. 111\u2013115). That is because the moral duty to perform\nthe (conventional) duties that constitute the role of citizen\nultimately depends either on an agent\u2019s exercise of will, i.e.\nconsent or accepting the benefits of others\u2019 cooperation, or a\nnatural duty, such as the duty to support just institutions or the\nduty to maximize aggregate welfare. In all of these cases,\ncitizens\u2019 duty to obey the law ultimately depends on a\nconsideration other than their membership in the polity. The task of\nmorally justifying political obligation bottoms out not in the fact of\nassociation but in a moral principle external to it.\n\nSome associative theorists respond that the critics conflate\nconsiderations that disable associative obligations with\nconsiderations that ground or justify associative obligations (Horton\nand Windeknecht 2015, p. 914; Scheffler 2018, p. 11). For instance, it\nmay be that the freedom to exit a relationship is a necessary\ncondition for it being one that has the sort of value that justifies\nobligations on the part of those who participate in it. Awareness of\nthe impossibility of exit may lead a person to feel alienated from\ntheir role in the relationship, or otherwise preclude it from being\none that is valuable for that person. Yet it is the good realized in\nthe relationship that justifies participants\u2019 claims against one\nanother, and the duties to which they correlate, not any consent\nimplicit in their continued participation in it.\n\nAnother rejoinder starts from the observation that actual associations\nbetween family, friends, and fellow citizens are typically\napproximations of moralized ideal types. That is,\nconsiderations of fairness, respect, care, and reliance are part and\nparcel of our concepts of parent, sibling, friend, and citizen. Thus,\nthe invocation of unfairness, disrespect, or neglect to rebut the\nclaim that one has a duty to \u00d8 because one occupies the role of\nsibling or citizen need not involve an appeal to some moral principle\nexternal to the relationship. Instead, it may involve an appeal to a\nprinciple internal to the relationship; that is, to a\nmoralized conception of what it is to be a sibling or citizen. This\nline of argument entails that obligation-generating associations exist\nonly where they realize the relevant ideal-type to a sufficient\ndegree; all genuine associations or relationships are, necessarily,\ngood or valuable associations. Thus, an associative theorist who\nadopts this line of argument has a ready response to the allegation\nthat she is committed to the conclusion that exploited or oppressed\ncitizens have a duty to obey the law: since they have no genuine\npolitical association or common citizenship with their oppressors,\nthey have none of the duties that flow from such a relationship when\nit exists.\n\nA last response holds that freedom, equality, fairness, and so on are\nnot abstract principles from which we can derive the existence or\nnon-existence of political obligation; rather, they are regulative\nideals to which (a sufficient number of) participants in genuine\npolitical communities are committed, despite their many differences on\npoints of detail large and small. There is no vantage point outside\nthe specific, historical, political communities in which we are\ninevitably situated, from which we can identify the true bases of our\nmoral obligations and so determine whether we have a moral duty to\nobey the law. Thus, there is no abstract, universal, moral principle\nof fairness, utility, respect for autonomy, etc., that provides a firm\nfoundation for associative obligations, or at least not one to which\nwe have any access. Rather, there are only the concrete practices of\nfairness, welfare-promotion, and so on realized in actual polities.\n\u201cPolitical obligations are practical commitments that come into\nplay through participants\u2019 mutually holding each other to\naccount in political practices,\u201d (Fossen 2014, p. 231) not\ntruths derived from more basic principles comprehended via an act of\nintellect.\n4.4 Natural Duty\n\nThe final contenders in the political obligation debates are natural\nduty accounts. In this context, natural duties are understood to be\nones people have simply in virtue of their status as moral agents;\nthey need do nothing to acquire them, nor does their bearing such\nduties depend on their occupying some role in a socially salient\nrelationship. Natural duties are also universal in scope; they are\nowed to all members of a class defined in terms of possession of some\nfeature, such as sentience or rationality. John Rawls first broached\nsuch an argument for political obligation when he asserted in A\nTheory of Justice that everyone is subject to a natural duty of\njustice that \u201crequires us to support and to comply with just\ninstitutions that exist and apply to us\u201d (1999, p. 99). More\nrecently, political philosophers and theorists including Jeremy\nWaldron (1999), Thomas Christiano (2008), Christopher Heath Wellman\n(2005), Anna Stilz (2009) and, arguably, David Estlund (2008; see\nsection 4.1 above) have refined and expanded upon Rawls\u2019s\nsomewhat vague contention, some of them in ways reminiscent of or even\nexplicitly modeled on Kant\u2019s defense of political obligation\n(see section 1.5 above).\n\nContemporary natural duty theorists differ over the natural duty that\nprovides the basis for political obligation. Christiano grounds his\naccount in a fundamental principle of justice requiring the equal\nadvancement of people\u2019s interests, Wellman in a Samaritan duty\nof easy rescue, and Stilz in a Kantian duty of respect for\nothers\u2019 freedom-as-independence, understood as a secure sphere\nof self-determination defined by a person\u2019s rights. These\ntheorists agree, however, that moral agents can discharge their\nnatural duty to others only through submission to the authority of a\ncommon legal order. This is so for several reasons: the demands of\njustice are sometimes underdetermined; its achievement requires the\nresolution of coordination problems; and most importantly, people\nreasonably disagree over the demands of justice. Christiano traces\nthis disagreement to what he calls the facts of judgment: diversity in\npeople\u2019s natural talents and cultural surroundings, cognitive\nbiases in their interpretation of people\u2019s interests and the\nvalue assigned to their own interests relative to the value assigned\nto the interests of others, and fallibility in both moral and\nnon-moral judgment. In light of these facts, even those who make a\ngood faith effort to discern what justice requires of them in their\ninteraction with others will fail to reach a consensus. Agents who act\non their own, private, judgment of justice will be perceived by others\nto be acting unjustly. If some are able to unilaterally impose their\nconception of justice on others, the latter will not enjoy\nfreedom-as-independence (Stilz 2009), or will suffer the violation of\ntheir fundamental interests in being at home in the world, in\ncorrecting for others\u2019 cognitive biases, and in being treated by\none\u2019s fellows as a person with equal moral standing (Christiano\n2008). Only submission to a common legal order can provide a solution\nto this problem of domination and conflict, argue natural duty\nproponents of political obligation. \u201cThere is no way other than\ngeneral compliance with a single authoritative set of rules to secure\npeace and protect basic moral rights\u201d (Wellman 2005, p. 45); law\n\u201csettle[s] for practical purposes what justice consists in by\npromulgating public rules for the guidance of individual\nbehavior\u201d (Christiano, p. 53); or in Stilz\u2019s Kantian\nterms, law replaces the unilateral imposition of obligations on others\nwith the omnilateral imposition of obligations on all.\n\nNot just any legal order will do, though. Rather, many natural duty\ntheorists of political obligation argue either that the law must be\ncrafted according to democratic procedures or that it must not violate\ncertain individual rights, or both, if those it addresses are to have\na duty to obey it. Christiano, for instance, argues that against a\nbackground constituted by diversity, cognitive bias, and fallibility,\nagents can be sure that their fundamental interest in judgment will\nnot be unjustifiably set back only if political power is exercised\nwithin institutions that publicly realize equality, i.e. democratic\nones. Likewise, Waldron defends the authority of a majority-rule\ndecision procedure on the basis of its \u201ccommitment to equality\n\u2013 a determination that when we, who need to settle on a single\ncourse of action, disagree about what to do, there is no reasonable\nbasis for us in designing our decision-procedures to accord greater\nweight to one side than to the other in the disagreement\u201d\n(Waldron 1999, p. 117; see also Lefkowitz 2004). Even if a person does\nnot believe that the particular scheme of distributive justice\nrealized in the law treats her justly, she can recognize that the\nprocess whereby that scheme was created, and can be modified or\neliminated, does treat her as an equal. Daniel Viehoff also appeals to\nthe egalitarian character of democratic procedures to justify a moral\nduty to obey the law, arguing that they best realize an ideal of\nrelational equality in which agents forbear from using any power\nadvantages they may enjoy to determine the terms of their morally\nnecessary coordination (Viehoff 2014; see also Kolodny 2014; Viehoff\n2019). Finally, Stilz argues that law omnilaterally imposes\nobligations on all only if it expresses a general will. It does the\nlatter if and only if it \u201cfirst, defines rights (protected\ninterests) that apply equally to all; second, it defines these rights\nvia a procedure that considers everyone\u2019s interests equally; and\nthird, everyone who is coerced to obey the law has a voice in the\nprocedure\u201d (Stilz 2009, p. 78). The latter two conditions, she\nmaintains, can only be met by a democratic procedure. Unsurprisingly,\nsome theorists remain unconvinced by the forgoing arguments for\ndemocracy\u2019s essential contribution to the justification of\npolitical obligation (see, e.g., Huemer 2013; Frye and Klosko\n2017).\n\nWhatever its details, many natural duty theorists also argue that the\nconception of the person that grounds their accounts of political\nobligation also limits the scope of legitimate law. Reasonable\ndisagreement over freedom-as-independence does not extend to torture,\nfor example, and at some perhaps indeterminate point the denial of\nfreedom of conscience clearly conflicts with a person\u2019s\nfundamental interests in correcting for cognitive bias and being at\nhome in the world. Most natural duty theorists conclude that subjects\nof a legal order that recognizes no rights on the part of some or all\nof its subjects against such treatment lacks legitimate authority,\neven if it is democratic.\n\nRecall that natural duty accounts of political obligation begin with\nduties that all moral agents owe to all other moral persons as such.\nSimmons argues that this commitment renders natural duty accounts\nunable to justify the particularity of political obligations; that is,\nthe fact that people have political obligations in virtue of their\ncitizenship or residence in particular states, and that they owe those\nobligations to that particular state (or to their fellow citizens)\n(1979, pp. 31\u20135; 2005, pp. 166\u201379). Even if we have a\nnatural duty \u201cto support and comply with just\ninstitutions,\u201d as Rawls maintains, why must we discharge that\nduty by supporting and complying with the just institutions that\ncomprise the state in which we are citizens or residents? True, those\nare the institutions that \u201capply to us,\u201d in the sense that\nthey claim jurisdiction over us. But why think this social fact\nhas any moral import, particularly if we think the political\ninstitutions of other states more worthy of our support because they\nbetter promote justice, or are in greater need of support?\n\nSome natural duty theorists point to the intensity and frequency of\ninteraction among those who live in close proximity to one another as\na justification for the duty to obey the laws of the particular\njurisdiction in which one resides (Waldron 1993; 1996). Others\nemphasize that a person who free-rides on his fellow citizens\u2019\nsupport for and compliance with the law to act on his own judgment of\nhow he can best discharge his natural duty of justice unfairly takes\nadvantage of them. Absent their good-faith sacrifice of the liberty to\nact on their private judgments regarding what justice requires, the\nfree-rider would likely be unable to act as he does (Wellman 2005, pp.\n44\u20135). Finally, some natural duty theorists argue that Simmons\nmisconstrues the natural duty of justice. Justice is not an outcome or\nstate of affairs that agents have a duty to promote via whatever means\nthey judge to be most effective or efficient, be it the political\ninstitutions of their state or those of another. Rather, justice\ncharacterizes a particular manner of interacting with others, such as\nwith respect for their freedom-as-independence or their fundamental\ninterests, including but not limited to their interests in judgment.\nAt least for a citizen of a liberal democratic state, the latter\nconstrual of justice entails that she can only treat her fellow\ncitizens justly if she guides her conduct according to its law (Stilz\n2012).\n\nSimmons has recently offered a rebuttal to this second line of\nargument (Simmons 2013). It entails, he argues, that citizens of one\nliberal-democratic state who are forcibly subjected to the rule of\nanother liberal-democratic state immediately acquire political\nobligations to the second state as long as they are accorded full\ncitizenship rights. Simmons treats this implication as a reductio ad\nabsurdum of the democratic Kantian justification for political\nobligation, a demonstration that it cannot properly account for the\nparticularity of such obligations. In part, this latest rejoinder by\nSimmons evidences and gives further impetus to a shift in the debate\nover political obligation from the question of what gives states a\nright to rule particular people, to which correlates their duty to\nobey the law, to the question of what gives states a right to rule\nover a particular territory [see the entry on territorial rights and\nterritorial justice]. But it also points to the need for natural duty\ntheorists to elaborate upon their so far brief discussions of the\ncontribution that a legitimate international legal order makes to the\nlegitimacy of domestic legal orders.\n5. Conclusion: A Plurality of Principles?\n\nThe four theories of political obligation sketched above do not\nexhaust the possibilities \u2013 Dorota Mokrosinska, for instance,\nhas recently advanced a \u201ccivil justice\u201d theory in her\nRethinking Political Obligation \u2013 but they seem to\nrepresent the main lines of argument. Indeed, even Mokrosinska\nacknowledges that her \u201cargument from civil justice combines\nelements of both natural duty accounts and associative theories\u201d\n(2012, p. 174). In fact, the search for a hybrid theory is something a\nnumber of philosophers have undertaken, either implicitly or\nexplicitly, in recent years. Gilbert (2006) and Steinberger (2004),\nfor example, seem to have developed hybrid theories without ever\nadvertising them as such. Gilbert\u2019s theory fuses the consent and\nassociative approaches through her reliance on joint\ncommitments to a plural subject, or group. For his part,\nSteinberger combines the consent and natural-duty approaches, arguing\nthat any \u201cgeneralized attempt to divorce obligations from\nnatural duties, to find justifications for the former that are\nentirely independent of the latter, is \u2026 doomed to fail\u201d\n(2004, p. 211). Wellman explicitly acknowledges the hybrid nature of\nhis theory, which combines an appeal to the natural duty of\nsamaritanism with reliance on the argument from fair play (Wellman\n2005, esp. chap 2).\n\nOthers, notably Klosko (2005), Jonathan Wolff (1995, 2000), and Dudley\nKnowles (2010) have explicitly called for a pluralistic or\nmultiple-principle approach to political obligation. There is no\nsingle answer to the problem of political obligation, as they see it,\nbecause the problem has more than one aspect. Not every\n\u201cmember\u201d of a polity will stand in the same relation to\nthe laws, for instance, which means that it is a mistake to think that\neveryone must have the same general obligation to obey. Nor is every\nobligation of equal force. Some are weak, such as the notorious\nobligation to stop at a traffic signal in an isolated area when no one\nelse is around, and others are quite strong. Klosko thus thinks it\nnecessary to rely on the principle of fairness to supply the core of a\njustification, but to supplement it with appeals to natural duty and\nthe common good (2006, chap. 5).\n\nAs yet there has been little reaction to these attempts to create\nhybrids and to draw on multiple principles in the attempt to provide a\nsatisfactory theory of political obligation (but see Edmundson 2004,\npp. 250\u201352). Those who doubt that such a theory can be\nconstructed, however, are likely to say that combining principles,\nwhether in hybrid or pluralist fashion, will not help, for combining a\nset of principles that are unsatisfactory individually will hardly\nproduce a strong and satisfying theory (Simmons 2007, n. 17). Whether\na plurality of principles is necessary or even desirable, in sum,\nremains one of many open questions with regard to the vexing problem\nof political obligation.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, N.
