    "main_text": "\n\n\nIn the context of language, self-reference is used to denote\na statement that refers to itself or its own referent. The most famous\nexample of a self-referential sentence is the liar sentence:\n\u201cThis sentence is not true.\u201d Self-reference is often used\nin a broader context as well. For instance, a picture could be\nconsidered self-referential if it contains a copy of itself (see the\nanimated image above); and a piece of literature could be considered\nself-referential if it includes a reference to the work itself. In\nphilosophy, self-reference is primarily studied in the context of\nlanguage. Self-reference within language is not only a subject of\nphilosophy, but also a field of individual interest in mathematics and\ncomputer science, in particular in relation to the foundations of\nthese sciences.\n\nThe philosophical interest in self-reference is to a large extent\ncentered around the paradoxes. A paradox is a seemingly sound\npiece of reasoning based on apparently true assumptions that leads to\na contradiction. The liar sentence considered above leads to a\ncontradiction when we try to determine whether it is true or not. If\nwe assume the sentence to be true, then what it states must be the\ncase, that is, it cannot be true. If, on the other hand, we assume it\nnot to be true, then what it states is actually the case, and thus it\nmust be true. In either case we are led to a contradiction. Since the\ncontradiction was obtained by a seemingly sound piece of reasoning\nbased on apparently true assumptions, it qualifies as a paradox. It is\nknown as the liar paradox. \n\nMost paradoxes of self-reference may be categorised as either\nsemantic, set-theoretic or epistemic. The\nsemantic paradoxes, like the liar paradox, are primarily relevant to\ntheories of truth. The set-theoretic paradoxes are relevant to the\nfoundations of mathematics, and the epistemic paradoxes are relevant\nto epistemology. Even though these paradoxes are different in the\nsubject matter they relate to, they share the same underlying\nstructure, and may often be tackled using the same mathematical means.\n\n\nIn the present entry, we will first introduce a number of the most\nwell-known paradoxes of self-reference, and discuss their common\nunderlying structure. Subsequently, we will discuss the profound\nconsequences that these paradoxes have on a number of different areas:\ntheories of truth, set theory, epistemology, foundations of\nmathematics, computability. Finally, we will present the most\nprominent approaches to solving the paradoxes. \n",
