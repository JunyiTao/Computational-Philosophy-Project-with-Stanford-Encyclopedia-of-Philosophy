    "main_text": "Linguistics || Structuralist Semantics\n4.1 Structuralist Semantics\n\nThe advances introduced by the structuralist conception of word\nmeaning are best appreciated by contrasting its basic assumptions with\nthose of historical-philological semantics. Let us recall the three\nmost important differences (Lepschy 1970; Matthews 2001).\n\nAnti-psychologism. Structuralist semantics views language\nas a symbolic system whose properties and internal dynamics can be\nanalyzed without taking into account their implementation in the\nmind/brain of language users. Just as the rules of chess can be stated\nand analyzed without making reference to the mental properties of\nchess players, so a theory of word meaning can, and should, proceed\nsimply by examining the formal role played by words within the system\nof the language.\nAnti-historicism. Since the primary explanandum of\nstructuralist semantics is the role played by lexical expressions\nwithin structured linguistic systems, structuralist semantics\nprivileges the synchronic description of word meaning. Diachronic\naccounts of word meaning are logically posterior to the analysis of\nthe relational properties statically exemplified by words at different\nstages of the evolution of the language.\nAnti-localism. Because the semantic properties of words\ndepend on the relations they entertain with other expressions in the\nsame lexical system, word meanings cannot be studied in isolation.\nThis is both an epistemological and a foundational claim, i.e., a\nclaim about how matters related to word meaning should be addressed in\nthe context of a semantic theory of word meaning, and a claim about\nthe dynamics whereby the elements of a system of signs acquire the\nmeaning they have for their users.\n\n\nThe account of lexical phenomena popularized by structuralism gave\nrise to a variety of descriptive approaches to word meaning. We can\ngroup them in three categories (Lipka 1992; Murphy 2003; Geeraerts\n2006).\n\nLexical Field Theory. Introduced by Trier (1931), it\nargues that word meaning should be studied by looking at the relations\nholding between words in the same lexical field. A lexical field is a\nset of semantically related words whose meanings are mutually\ninterdependent and which together spell out the conceptual structure\nof a given domain of reality. Lexical Field Theory assumes that\nlexical fields are closed sets with no overlapping meanings or\nsemantic gaps. Whenever a word undergoes a change in meaning (e.g.,\nits range of application is extended or contracted), the whole\narrangement of its lexical field is affected (Lehrer 1974).\nComponential Analysis. Developed in the second half of\nthe 1950s by European and American linguists (e.g., Pattier, Coseriu,\nBloomfield, Nida), this framework argues that word meaning can be\ndescribed on the basis of a finite set of conceptual building blocks\ncalled semantic components or features. For example,\n\u2018man\u2019 can be analyzed as [+ male],\n[+ mature],\n\u2018woman\u2019 as [\u2212 male],\n[+ mature],\n\u2018child\u2019\nas [+/\u2212 male]\n[\u2212 mature] (Leech\n1974).\nRelational Semantics. Prominent in the work of linguists\nsuch as Lyons (1963), this approach shares with Lexical Field Theory\nthe commitment to a style of analysis that privileges the description\nof lexical relations, but departs from it in two important respects.\nFirst, it postulates no direct correspondence between sets of related\nwords and domains of reality, thereby dropping the assumption that the\norganization of lexical fields should be understood to reflect the\norganization of the non-linguistic world. Second, instead of deriving\nstatements about the meaning relations entertained by a lexical item\n(e.g., synonymy, hyponymy) from an independent account of its meaning,\nfor relational semantics word meanings are constituted by the set of\nsemantic relations words participate in (Evens et al. 1980; Cruse\n1986).\n\n",
