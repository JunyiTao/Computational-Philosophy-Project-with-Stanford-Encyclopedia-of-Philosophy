    "main_text": "Moral: Feminist Epistemology and the Bias Paradox\n6. Moral: Feminist Epistemology and the Bias Paradox\n\n\nAnother relatively recent development in epistemology is the\nmovement to view epistemology from the perspective of feminism (Jaggar\n1983 and 1989, Code 1991, Anderson 1995, Alcoff 1996). The growth of\ninterest in this approach to epistemology is exceeded only by that in\nnaturalizing epistemology and at times the two perspectives are engaged\nsimultaneously (Antony 1993, Duran 1994, Nelson 1990 and 1996, Nelson\nand Nelson 1996, Campbell 1998 and 2003). At first glance the prospect of a\nfeminist epistemology may appear to be a contradiction in terms.\nFeminism is a political movement aimed at eliminating the subordination\nof women to men, while the goal of epistemology is to establish and\ndefend, from a disinterested and impartial point of view, systematic\nstandards for knowledge or justified belief. How can a political\nmovement that is partial regarding the interests of women in relation\nto men be disinterested and impartial? The idea of a feminist\nepistemology, not to say a feminist moral epistemology, may therefore\nappear incomprehensible.\n\n\nFeminists have not been slow to recognize this challenge and have made\na variety of replies. (See Harding 1986 and 1995 for a comparative\nstudy.) Postmodern feminists call into question the concepts of\nknowledge, truth, and impartial justification. Others, however, would\nagree with the assumption of this essay that it is possible to have\nnon-moral knowledge and to offer justifications that adequately\nsupport the truth of non-moral beliefs. They maintain that a feminist\nperspective is able to enhance rather than diminish the accuracy of\nnon-moral beliefs. For example, studies of coronary heart disease were\ncarried out for a long time only on men, based on the belief that the\nresults would apply equally well to women (Mastroianni et\nal. 1994, pp.  64\u201366). In fact, significant differences\nexist, but they came to light only after pressures to broaden the\nstudies. It is agreed on all sides, at this point, that the new\nstudies give a more objective picture of the development of coronary\nheart disease in men and women. Notice, though, that this result is\nentirely compatible with the change in the studies being motivated by\ninterest in women\u2019s health. The conclusion to draw is not that\npolitical motivation is necessarily advantageous for achieving more\nreliable theories but rather that it can be.  Moreover, feminist\nmotivations can lead to the discovery of forms of partiality that have\ndistorted the truth and prevented access to relevant evidence. At a\nstill deeper level, feminists who accept the possibility of knowing\nthe truth have argued that epistemology itself can be transformed\nthrough a better understanding of the ways in which partiality can\nincrease or decrease our chances of knowing the truth.  They have\nargued that it is important to understand how partiality can increase\nor decrease the chances of knowing the truth when the truths in\nquestion concern the subordination of women to men.\n\n\nFeminists who accept the concept of truth are motivated, of course,\nnot simply by the desire to discover the truth about the subordination\nof women (what forms it takes, how it comes about, where it has become\npart of the practice of epistemology). They are also motivated by the\ndesire to stop it. This motivation is justified, most feminists would\nsay, by their knowing that the subordination is unjust and hence\nmorally wrong. At this juncture, one may want to ask how such feminist\nepistemology could create a problem for the possibility of moral\nknowledge. It would seem, on the contrary, that epistemology that is so\nmotivated depends for its rationale on moral knowledge.\n\n\nThe problem is that feminist criticism of knowledge claims that\nreinforce injustice extends to claims of moral knowledge. Some\nexamples may help to clarify this point. Some libertarians have taken\nit to be self-evident that each of us owns his or her own body and\nwhatever is produced through its labor, provided that the goods used\nin the labor are freely and justly acquired so that their acquisition\ndoes not leave others worst off than they were prior to the\nacquisition (Nozick 1974).  This premise is a basic building block for\nsome moral and political theories of justice. Okin (1989) argues,\nhowever, that the premise leads to absurdity when one takes into\naccount the power of women to produce humans through their physical\nlabor, using sperm that they may freely and justly acquire through\npurchase without leaving anyone worst off than before. An absurd\nconsequence of the theory would be that women own their children as\nproperty whom they can dispose of at will.  Not only is this result\nmorally absurd, but there is the further consequence that mothers\nbeing the products of mothers both do and do not own themselves. She\nargues that an inconsistency can also be produced for Rawls\u2019 theory of\njustice, since it is so structured that justice does not apply within\nfamilies yet at the same time the theory requires it to apply there in\norder for justice as fairness to be feasible (Okin 1989). In both\ncases Susan Moller Okin, a feminist moral and political philosopher,\nhas criticized the foundations of a theory of justice by arguing that\nits basic premises are gender-biased in ways that reinforce the\nsubordination of women to men. In one case, gender-bias occurs by\nfailing to count reproductive labor as genuine labor, in the other by\nfailing to recognize how injustice within the family is a major force\nin creating and maintaining the subordination of women to men in the\npublic domain. (For discussion of related problems that arise from the\nquest for impartial moral knowledge when it ignores human embodiment,\nsee Walker 1998, Bach 2012, and Babbitt 2014.)\n\n\nIn order to see how feminist critiques of bias in prominent theories\nof justice lead to paradox, recall the feminist rejection of\nimpartiality as an epistemic ideal. As noted, feminist have defended\nthis rejection by noting that partiality can lead to more accurate\naccounts of reality just as it can lead to distortion and\nmisrepresentation. Partiality that is positive in its results, as in\nthe discovery of the different development of coronary heart disease in\nwomen, should not be rejected. In the heart disease example, however,\nit is possible to ascertain the worthiness of the result independently\nof the bias. Whatever led to the broader study of coronary heart\ndisease, the results of the study can be independently verified by\nfeminist and non-feminists alike. Compare partiality in the moral case.\nIs it possible to know that the resulting feminist theories of justice\nare more objective, less distorting in their representations of justice\nthan the theories under criticism? It may be hard to see how the truth\nof the new feminist theory can be recognized independently of the sense\nof justice that motivated the critique. Does the feminist sense of\njustice constitute a partiality that leads to a more objective, less\ndistorting representation of moral reality? That depends on whether the\njustice in question is identifiable independently of the feminist sense\nof justice. If there is no understanding of true justice that is\nindependent of the partiality that motivates the critique of the\ntraditional theory, then the appeal to true justice appears\nquestion-begging and self-serving.\n\n\nWhat seems to have gone wrong is that feminists are in the position\nof rejecting impartiality as a general epistemic and moral ideal, but\nat the same time they want to reject gender bias because it obviously\nfails to measure up to the ideal of impartiality. Louise Antony has\ncalled this inconsistency \u201cthe bias paradox\u201d (Antony 1993). It is a\nparadox or at least has the appearance of one because there are\nprincipled reasons for rejecting the ideal of complete impartiality.\nNot only are there the reasons already given, but evolutionary reasons\nexist as well for rejecting impartiality. Natural selection has\nequipped us with the means to sort through massive amounts of sensory\ninformation so that we can pick out and interpret quickly information\nrelevant to our survival. Without built-in \u201cbiases\u201d of this nature we\ncould not begin to know anything about the world around us. Yet we also\nwant to reject biases that produce a \u201cbiased\u201d (in a pejorative sense,\ni.e., distorted) representation of the truth. Feminists and\nnon-feminists are in a bind, unless a principled way exists to separate\ngood biases from bad ones. Antony suggests that epistemically good\nbiases are ones that lead to finding out the truth, while epistemically\nbad biases lead away from the truth. Although other epistemologists\nhave suggested that good epistemic standards may be distinguished from\nbad ones by how well they lead to finding out the truth, Antony\u2019s\nproposal is more radical, since she allows political biases to have\npositive epistemic status when they are truth-conducive. But she grants\nthat much work remains to be done to make this resolution clear and\ngenerally acceptable.\n\n\nDoes this suggestion help in averting the threat of circularity that\nwe came upon one paragraph back in reviewing feminist moral critiques\nof gender bias in prominent theories of justice? Arguably it does,\nprovided that we understand moral fact as being independent of our\nopinions about it and our procedures for trying to establish it\n(Campbell 2001). That is, the suggestion helps, provided that moral\nfact is understood either in the realist sense of fact (one not\nreducible to what we can agree upon or what our methods would\ndetermine) or in a sense of objective fact that allows for the\npossibility of massive moral error whatever the efforts to the\ncontrary. At this point we may be inclined to ask whether it is\npossible to know such moral facts? We should remind ourselves,\nhowever, that the main reasons to doubt that we can know moral facts\nare precisely the reasons that we have already examined under the\nheadings above. The objections labeled sociological, psychological,\nontological, evolutionary, and methodological are not aimed against\nknowing moral facts in some non-literal sense of fact, but against\nknowing moral facts in the same sense that we appear to know other\nfacts about the world. If the possible replies that we have canvassed\nare adequate responses to these objections, then it is arguable that\nwe may avert the threat of circularity by Antony\u2019s suggested\nresolution.\n\n\nThis result can be generalized, since it would apply to moral\ncriticisms of impartiality that arise because of concerns about racial\nor class bias. (See Thomas 1992\u20133 for a discussion of the\nimportance of moral deference to the testimony of those in oppressed\ngroups.) If the resolution by appeal to realist fact is successful in\naverting circularity and paradox in the case of gender bias, there is\nno reason why it should not succeed in other cases in which an\nepistemic standard is rejected on other moral grounds. Would the\nresolution be relevant to the moral criticism of other epistemic\nstandards? An example in point would be the criticism by feminists and\nnon-feminists of purely individual-based standards of inquiry,\nespecially in science (Longino 1990, Hardwig 1991, Goldman 1999, and\nKitcher 2011b). Some of these critiques are partly moral, since they\nemphasize the need for democratic values and trust in the context of\nscientific inquiry.  Arguably, they are also motivated by the\nperception that the individual-centered modes of inquiry are at a\ndisadvantage in discovering the facts. (On this last point see the\nsections 7\u201310 to follow.) If we accept the proposed resolution of the\nbias paradox, we could argue that the change in epistemic standards is\njustified on both grounds. In the case where the inquiry is moral\nrather than scientific, can we imagine criticism of epistemic\nstandards other than impartiality? An example might be criticism of\nthe individual-based modes of moral inquiry presupposed in\nintuitionism. As before, we would need a strategy to avert circularity\nand paradox. If the strategy is to stick to a realist or sufficiently\nobjective conception of moral fact, its success will depend on whether\nthe problems canvassed above that confront the possibility of such\nmoral knowledge can be resolved.\n7. Moral Knowledge May Be Possible \u2013 But for Whom?\n\n\nWe have addressed six major clusters of problems that threaten the\npossibility of moral knowledge defined as someone having a justified\ntrue moral belief. For each cluster we have noted avenues of\nresolution worth further exploration. Nonetheless, the problems may\nsuggest that our definition of moral knowledge misrepresents the\ninherently social nature of moral knowledge. Developments in the\ninterdisciplinary literature on the evolution and psychology of\nmorality reinforce this worry.\n\n\nThe psychologists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber challenge the\nassumption that complex knowledge resides in the beliefs of rational\nindividuals (Mercier and Sperber 2017). Countless experiments over\nseveral decades have shown us to be on average very bad at reasoning\non our own. One well-known case is the Wason selection test taken by\nthousands of subjects. In one version subjects have in front of them\nfour cards with a number on one side and a letter on the other. They\nare asked which cards that show E, K, 2, or 7 would they turn over to\ndetermine the truth of the following statement: If a vowel is on one\nside there is an even number on the other. On average only 20% get the\nright answer. If they reason together in small groups, however, their\nsuccess rate jumps to 80%. What accounts for this improvement?\n\n\nMost people, including scientists, are subject to \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\nin that they look for data that are consistent with what they think\nmight be true. Thus if they think the statement in the test is true,\nthey might turn over the \u201c2\u201d card, since doing so cannot help but be\nconsistent with the truth of the statement. What people tend not to\nsearch for is something that could disconfirm their hypothesis, such\nas finding out whether there is a vowel on the other side of card\n\u201c7\u201d. The groups that did well on this test turned over only cards \u201cE\u201d\nand \u201c7\u201d, since these are the only cards that could disconfirm the\ntruth of the statement at issue. Mercier and Sperber suggest that the\npsychological dynamics of reasoning in groups guard against\nconfirmation bias. Each member of a group can have an idea how to\nsolve the problem at issue and put it to the group, but others in the\ngroup will tend to look critically at a proposal from someone else to\nsee if the proposal has a flaw. There is in this way a division of\ncognitive labor within the group. While each member may suffer\nconfirmation bias, as well as other biases, the whole group need not,\nsince each member will try to disconfirm solutions offered by\nothers. The upshot is that the group as a whole will tend to do well,\nunless everyone is biased in exactly the same way. The best groups\ncomprise people who are cognitively diverse but listen well to each\nother.\n\n\nIs there a lesson here for resolving moral problems through social\ninteractive reasoning? Mercier and Sperber cite the abolition of\nslavery by the British Parliament in 1834 after some fifty years of\ndebate at all levels of society. Abolitionists were at first in the\nminority. They asked how Christian moral norms of brotherly love and\nequality before God could be reconciled with enslaving Africans. Those\ndefending slavery retorted that Africans were less intelligent and\nlacked integrity, but these claims were contradicted by the eloquence\nand evident moral character of former slaves who addressed public\nmeetings and by Christian witnesses who had known slaves from personal\nexperience. The economic consequences of abolition were also\ndebated. In the end the majority of public opinion changed through\ndiscussions that permitted careful examination of diverse points of\nview from different parts of society over a long enough period to\nestablish credible evidence about the negative consequences of slavery\ncompared to the likely positive effects of its abolition.\n\n\nThis example suggests that, while people may have moral beliefs that\ninitially few others share, free and interactive reasoning in a\ndiverse group can reveal these moral beliefs to be the better\njustified among the alternatives. Many other examples, such as debates\nabout women\u2019\u2019s right to education or their right to vote,\nconvey the same message. The implication is that moral knowledge, to\nthe extent that it is possible, is more likely to be achieved through\ninteractive reasoning among those with diverse viewpoints who are open\nto criticism from each other.\n8. Moral Knowledge Socially Embodied in Emotions\n\n\nThe philosophical movement of social epistemology supports this\nperspective. It understands knowledge to be primarily a social\nachievement (see entry for Social Epistemology). Moral\nknowledge may be still more deeply social than is generally\nrecognized, even among those who grant that justifying moral beliefs\ninvolves a social process of interactive reasoning within a\ncognitively diverse group. When moral consistency reasoning is part of\nthe social justification process, the reasoning entails efforts to\neliminate emotional inconsistencies in thinking (Campbell and Kumar\n2012). In that case moral knowledge, if it were achieved, would be\nembodied not only in the beliefs of those seeking knowledge, but also\nin their motivations and feelings. Indeed, given the cognitive basis\nof moral emotions, it is possible for a society to know through their\nfeelings of guilt that they have done morally wrong even when they\nbelieve otherwise for ideological reasons, parallel to the case of the\nwomen who cannot shake her feelings of resentment for being unfairly\npassed over for promotion in favour of a male colleague when she\nbelieves her feelings cannot justified given the lesser social status\nof women (Campbell 2007).\n9. Epistemological Exclusion\n\n\nNew research on moral evolution accords with the above social view of\nmoral knowledge. Michael Tomasello (2016) makes the case that human\nmoral norms have their origin in the phenomenon of \u201cshared\nintentionality\u201d that binds diverse individuals to a common project in\nwhich they see each other as equal partners. When moral norms conflict\neach person in a group that is motivated by these norms is an equal\npartner in the shared project of resolving the moral conflict. If\nmorality is a shared project in this way, the cost of excluding some\npersons from the process of resolving moral conflict can be\nsignificant. Such exclusion can undermine achieving moral knowledge\nthat depends on input from diverse individuals acting as equals.\n\n\nThis understanding of moral knowledge reflects moral concerns of many\nfeminists. For example, Miranda Fricker (2007) examines the \u201cepistemic\ninjustice\u201d of being wrongfully denied recognition as a potential\nknower due to one\u2019s race, gender, or other identity. See also\nKristie Dotson (2011) on the epistemic injustice of silencing caused\nby violence against women. Other feminists point out that non-moral\nknowledge claims can be unfairly biased when they are based only on\nexperience of men or neglect the social structures that unjustly bias\nthe perception of causation. For example, it is sometimes thought that\nthe burden of childrearing is biologically determined. Sarah Baffer\nHrdy (2009), however, offer a new evolutionary perspective on the\nshared responsibility for childcare among early humans. Cordelia Fine\n(2017) challenges the familiar view that gender roles are hormonally\ndetermined. Kate Manne (2018) shows how patriarchy tends to undermine\nsocially our ability to reason freely about gender\ndiscrimination. Even when reasoning is conceived explicitly as being\nsocial and equal, as in social contract theory, the moral upshot of\nreasoning can reflect racial bias when reasoning is abstracted from\nactual social context (Charles Mills 2017) or when the causal effects\nof social structures, like de facto segregation, are ignored\n(Elizabeth Anderson 2010).\n\n10. The Six Clusters of Problems: Any Progress?\n\n\nHow do these considerations bear on the possibility of moral\nknowledge? In particular, does a group-centered conception of moral\nknowledge that is based on social interactive reasoning help to\naddress the six main clusters of problems raised earlier about the\npossibility of moral knowledge? My answer is positive but\nqualified. Consider the clusters of problems in order.\n\n\nThe first cluster concerns the sociological reality of moral\ndisagreement. Obviously the group-centered conception of moral\nknowledge does not eliminate differences in moral outlook, but it may\nalter how we should think about these differences. I said early on\nthat I would assume that we have knowledge of some non-moral\ntruths. An example would be knowledge that the Earth is round rather\nthan flat. There are pockets of people who still believe that the\nEarth is flat. Should most remain confident in knowing that the Earth\nis round? The reason they should is the social interactive reasoning\nabout the issue over centuries from diverse perspectives leading to\nnear universal agreement. Can a similar conclusion be drawn in certain\nimportant cases of moral agreement, for example, about moral\nprogress?\n\n\nAllen Buchanan and Russell Powell (2018) cite ten examples of moral\nprogress. Among them are these four: \u201c\u2026the large reduction,\nbeginning with the British abolition, of the incidence of the most\nextreme forms of slavery\u2026the increasing recognition and\ninstitutionalization of the equal rights of women in some countries,\nbetter treatment of some non-human animals, abolition of at least the\ncruellest punishments\u201d (p. 47). While not everyone would agree even\nwith these examples, there exists, parallel to the non-moral case,\nextremely broad agreement among diverse groups who have reasoned\nfreely and interactively over extended periods. As Buchanan and Powell\nmake clear, moral progress in such cases goes hand in hand with moral\nregress in many areas and unresolved deep moral differences about\nother issues. On the other hand, if what is in question is the bare\npossibility of moral knowledge, a positive answer seems warranted.\n\n\nThe second, psychological cluster of problems focuses on the dual\nfunction of moral judgment as motivation and belief. The problem is\nhow a judgment can be both at once. A resolution that we examined is\nthat moral judgment can be a hybrid of the two states. That suggestion\nis much easier to defend for moral knowledge when it is embodied in a\ngroup of individuals who have distinct beliefs and motivations. The\ngroup as a whole is motivated by a collection of internalized moral\nnorms that the group believes to be justified. Even if no mental state\nof an individual in a group performs both functions at once, the group\nas a whole can serve both functions of belief and motivation as they\nare differently embodied in the mental states of its members.\n\n\nThe ontological cluster is a different matter. While the subjective\npart of knowledge shifts from individual judgment to the\ninternalization of norms within the group and a reasoned consensus\nthat the norms are justified, the reality that the knowledge is about\nremains a difficult issue: Is moral truth to be treated as\ntheological, non-natural, or natural? There is, however, a subtle\ndifference. The truth in question is about whether the emotionally\nembodied norms can withstand the scrutiny of the whole group under\nsustained interactive reasoning in light of relevant non-moral\nknowledge. Some will complain that such rendering of the object of\nmoral knowledge is too subjective, since it turns moral knowledge into\na form of group self-knowledge. A similar worry was noted when we\ndiscussed group-based justification (Copp 1995) and pragmatic\nnaturalism (Kitcher 2011). We should concede that such worries need to\nbe answered.\n\n\nThe fourth, fifth, and sixth clusters concerning evolutionary,\nmethodological, and moral problems are easier to address, since the\nnew understanding of moral knowledge is based on (a) current knowledge\nof evolution, (b) the methodologies of (i) naturalized epistemology,\n(ii) reflective equilibrium when expanded to include moral consistency\nreasoning (Campbell 2014, 2017), and (iii) pragmatic naturalism, and\n(c) moral concerns raised by feminists. When moral knowledge is\ninterpreted to be consistent with psychological and evolutionary\nstudies of morality, these studies and the methodologies listed tend\nto reinforce the group-centered conception of moral knowledge. Issues\nwill remain, such as the ontological one just noted, but on balance\nthe problems for moral knowledge are diminished. The moral problems of\nbias raised in feminist epistemology are no exception, since the\nfeminist literature cited above emphasizes the social nature of moral\nknowledge. That said, resolution of the bias paradox in feminist\nepistemology may require a realist moral ontology (as noted in section\n6) and it may be unclear how to provide it. Our view that moral\nknowledge is possible is therefore qualified.\n11. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has addressed six major clusters of problems that threaten\nthe possibility of moral knowledge. Subject to the constraints noted\nat the outset, the aim has been to examine these problems with an eye\nto their complexity, especially their mutual ramifications, and to\nexplore avenues of possible resolution that are evident in the\nphilosophical and interdisciplinary literature. From this survey, we\ncan see that for each cluster of problems there are avenues of\nresolution worth further exploration, especially given\ninterdisciplinary research implying that moral knowledge is deeply\nsocial.",
