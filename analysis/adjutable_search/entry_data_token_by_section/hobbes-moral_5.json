    "main_text": "The Laws of Nature\n6. The Laws of Nature\n\nHobbes argues that the state of nature is a miserable state of war in\nwhich none of our important human ends are reliably realizable.\nHappily, human nature also provides resources to escape this miserable\ncondition. Hobbes argues that each of us, as a rational being, can see\nthat a war of all against all is inimical to the satisfaction of her\ninterests, and so can agree that \u201cpeace is good, and therefore\nalso the way or means of peace are good\u201d. Humans will recognize\nas imperatives the injunction to seek peace, and to do those things\nnecessary to secure it, when they can do so safely. Hobbes calls these\npractical imperatives \u201cLawes of Nature\u201d, the sum of which\nis not to treat others in ways we would not have them treat us. These\n\u201cprecepts\u201d, \u201cconclusions\u201d or\n\u201ctheorems\u201d of reason are \u201ceternal and\nimmutable\u201d, always commanding our assent even when they may not\nsafely be acted upon. They forbid many familiar vices such as\niniquity, cruelty, and ingratitude. Although commentators do not agree\non whether these laws should be regarded as mere precepts of prudence,\nor rather as divine commands, or moral imperatives of some other sort,\nall agree that Hobbes understands them to direct people to submit to\npolitical authority. They tell us to seek peace with willing others by\nlaying down part of our \u201cright to all things\u201d, by mutually\ncovenanting to submit to the authority of a sovereign, and further\ndirect us to keep that covenant establishing sovereignty.\n",
