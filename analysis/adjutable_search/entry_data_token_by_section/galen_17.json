    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind\n7. Philosophy of Mind\nGalen\u2019s work on the soul (psuch\u0113) (including his work on ethics, discussed in \u00a78 below) presents one of the most interesting aspects of his philosophical-medical output, and has attracted considerable scholarly attention in the last 40 years; see especially Manuli and Vegetti 1988; Hankinson 1991b, 1993; Donini 2004, 2008; Gill 2010; Singer 2013 (with further bibliography), 2018; Havrda 2017; Marechal 2019; Vinkesteijn 2019; Devinant 2020. At the same time it is an area beset with interpretive complexities. Galen\u2019s moral psychology, or philosophy of mind, bases itself strongly on Plato, while also attempting to do justice to the contemporary state of knowledge in anatomy and physiology, and also taking on much from both philosophical and medical traditions which tie the psuch\u0113 and its pathology closely to a theory of elements or humours, classifying or conceptualizing its pathology in terms of physical imbalances of the body (especially of the brain).\nThese complexities, and difficulties of interpretation, have led some to talk of the uneasy co-existence of different \u201cmodels of the soul\u201d in Galen (see Manuli 1986, 1988; Singer 2013: 18\u201333). Certainly, any study of Galen\u2019s theoretical accounts of the soul must involve an analysis of many different texts, both those specifically devoted to the theory of the psuch\u0113, and ones which touch on it in a wide range of different contexts (physiological, pathological, dietetic, pharmacological); it must also take account of the fact that these texts belong to quite different technical genres and draw upon a variety of traditions, intellectual approaches and specialist concepts and vocabularies; and of the fact that the focus of the argument is radically different in some of these different contexts. Again, in any attempt to summarize Galen\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of mind\u201d, the caution should be made that his primary motivation and intellectual concern throughout nearly all these texts are those of the practising physician, not those of the theoretical philosopher. (For a comprehensive account of the pathological and medical aspect of Galen\u2019s work on the psuch\u0113 see now Devinant 2020.)\n",
