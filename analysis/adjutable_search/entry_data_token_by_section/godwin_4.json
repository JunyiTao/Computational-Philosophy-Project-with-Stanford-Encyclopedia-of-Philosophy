    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy\n5. A Philosophy of History\n\nPolitical Justice condemns all government interference with\nindividual judgment. Godwin claims that over time history has seen\ngradual progress as knowledge has developed and has spread and as men\nand women have liberated themselves from their political chains and\ntheir subordination to the fraud and imposture of monarchical and\naristocratic government and established religion. His optimistic\nbelief in the impotence of government against advancing opinion (which\npartly glosses and extends Hume\u2019s comment that all government is\nfounded on opinion) is balanced by some sociologically perceptive\ncomments on the baleful influence that certain types of political\npower have on those who exercise it or are subject to it. These\ninsights are also explored in The Enquirer, but it is in\nGodwin\u2019s later novels, from Caleb Williams (1794)\nonward, that it is given its fullest rein. As Godwin indicates in his\nunpublished essay, \u201cOn History and Literature\u201d (1798)\n(PPW V, 290\u2013301), literature can be used to show how\nthe cultures and institutions into which we are born come inexorable\nto shape our lives, leading us to act in ways which destroy our\nchances of happiness. The six mature novels effectively follow through\nthe critical enterprise launched in Political Justice by\ntheir narrative histories of men who are brought to grief by the\naristocratic and inegalitarian principles of their societies.\n",
