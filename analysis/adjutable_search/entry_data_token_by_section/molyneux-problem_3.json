Empirical Approaches in the Nineteenth Century\n\nAbout 1800 several developments occurred which justify the speaking of\na new period in the history of Molyneux\u2019s problem. New accounts\nof patients operated on for cataracts were published, and shed fresh\nlight on the issue. Whereas Cheselden had only noticed what his\npatient observed in more or less natural circumstances, later\nophthalmologists performed experiments which showed whether their\npatients were able to see form, size, distance, etc. Some, such as\nFranz and Nunneley, were especially interested in Molyneux\u2019s\nproblem as such, and performed experiments with the prescribed globe\nand cube. Some of the reports were in agreement with that of\nCheselden, others conflicted with it. The cases could not easily be\ncompared, however, since the pre- and post-operative circumstances\ndiffered to such a great extent. As one might have expected, an\nextended scale of possible solutions to the Molyneux problem was\nbrought under consideration.\n\nWhat is more, specialists also began to consider observations\nconcerning the sight of newly born animals and babies when discussing\nMolyneux\u2019s problem. Some of those doing research in the field,\nsuch as Adam Smith and Johannes M\u00fcller, supposed that the sight\nof young animals could be compared with that of a person who had been\nmade to see. The fact that certain animals see objects at a distance\nas soon as they are born suggested that Molyneux\u2019s question\ncould be answered affirmatively. This turned out to be a strong\nargument against Berkeley\u2019s theory of vision. Others, Thomas\nBrown for instance, were of the opinion that the visual behaviour of\nbabies could be compared with that of a blind person who had been\noperated upon and made to see. They were convinced that in both cases\nseeing has to be learned, and that Molyneux\u2019s question had,\ntherefore, to be answered in the negative.\n\nWheatstone\u2019s discovery that the perception by sight of the third\ndimension of space is immediate, was used as a reason for answering\nMolyneux\u2019s question affirmatively. The discovery was also\nregarded as disproving Berkeley\u2019s theory of vision.\n\nThe data concerning the sight of patients who had been operated upon\nfor cataracts, and of young animals and infants, were used as evidence\nin the debate concerning the question of whether the perception of\nspace is innate or acquired. Although Molyneux\u2019s problem was\nfrequently discussed in this debate, there was still no agreement on\nthe right solution to it.\n",
