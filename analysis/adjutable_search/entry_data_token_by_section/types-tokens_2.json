    "main_text": "Importance and Applicability of the Distinction || Linguistics\n2.1 Linguistics\n\n\nIt is generally accepted that linguists are interested in types.\nSome, e.g. Lyons (1977, p. 28), claim the linguist is interested only\nin types. Whether this is so or not, linguists certainly appear to be\nheavily committed to types; they \u201ctalk as though\u201d there\nare types. That is, they often quantify over types in their theories\nand refer to them by means of singular terms. As Quine has emphasized,\na theory is committed to the existence of entities of a given sort if\nand only if they must be counted among the values of the variables in\norder for the statements in the theory to be true. Linguistics is rife\nwith such quantifications. For example, we are told that an educated\nperson's vocabulary is about 15,000 words, but Shakespeare's\nwas more nearly 30,000. These are types, as are the twenty-six\nletters of the English alphabet, and its eighteen cardinal\nvowels. (Obviously the numbers would be much larger if we\nwere counting tokens). Linguists also frequently refer to types by\nmeans of singular terms. According to the O.E.D., for\nexample, the noun \u2018color\u2019\u2019 is from early\nmodern English and in addition to its pronunciation [k\u0252\u2019\nl\u0259r] has two \"modern current or most usual spellings\" [colour,\ncolor], eighteen earlier spellings [collor, collour, coloure, colowr,\ncolowre, colur, colure, cooler, couler, coullor, coullour, coolore,\ncoulor, coulore, coulour, culler, cullor, cullour] and eighteen senses\n(vol. 2, p. 636).  According to Webster's, the word\n\u2018schedule\u2019 has four current pronunciations:\n['ske-(,)j\u00fc(\u0259)l], ['ske-j\u0259l] (US),\n['she-j\u0259l] (Can) and ['she-(,)dy\u00fc(\u0259)l]\n(Brit) (p. 1044). Thus, linguistics is apparently committed\nto the existence of these words, which are types.\n\n\nReferences to types is not limited to letters, vowels and words, but\noccur extensively in all branches of linguistics. Lexicography\ndiscusses, in terms that make it clear that it is types being referred\nto, nouns, verbs, words, their stems, definitions, forms,\npronunciations and origins. Phonetics is committed to consonants,\nsyllables, words and sound segments, the human vocal tract and its\nparts (the tongue has five). Phonology also organizes sounds but in\nterms of phonemes, allophones, alternations, utterances, phonological\nrepresentations, underlying forms, syllables, words, stress-groups,\nfeet and tone groups. Morphology is apparently committed to morphemes,\nroots, affixes, and so forth, and syntax to sentences, semantic\nrepresentations, LF representations, among other things. Clearly, just\nas words and letters and vowels have tokens, so do all of the other\nitems mentioned (nouns, pronunciations, syllables, tone groups and so\nforth). It is more controversial whether the items studied in\nsemantics (the meanings of signs, their sense relations, etc.) also\ncome in types and tokens, and similarly for pragmatics (including\nspeaker meanings, sentence meanings, implicatures, presuppositions,\netc.) It seems to hinge on whether a mental event (token) or part of\nit could be a meaning, a matter that cannot be gone into here. See\nDavis (2003) for a view according to which concepts and\nthoughts\u2014varieties of meaning\u2014come in types and\ntokens.\n\n\nIt is notable that when one of the above types is defined, it is\ndefined in terms of other types. So for example, sentences might be\n(partly) defined in terms of words, and words in terms of phonemes.\n\n\nThe universal and largely unscrutinized reliance of linguistics on the\ntype-token relationship and related distinctions like that of\nlangue to parole, and competence to\nperformance, is the subject of Hutton's cautionary book\n(1990).\n",
