    "main_text": "Orientation\n1. Orientation\n\n\nThe theory of divine illumination is generally conceived of as\ndistinctively Christian, distinctively medieval, and distinctively\nAugustinian. There is some justification for this, of course, inasmuch\nas Christian medieval philosophers gave the theory serious and\nsustained discussion, and inasmuch as Augustine gave illumination a\nvery prominent role in his theory of knowledge. Still, it is better to\nthink of the theory in a wider context. Divine illumination played a\nprominent part in ancient Greek philosophy, in the later Greek\ncommentary tradition, in neo-Platonism, and in medieval Islamic\nphilosophy. Moreover, it was Christian medieval philosophers, near the\nend of the thirteenth century, who were ultimately responsible for\ndecisively refuting the theory. I will suggest that we view this last\ndevelopment as the first great turning point in the history of\ncognitive theory.\n\n\nI understand a theory of divine illumination to be a theory on which\nthe human mind regularly relies on some kind of special supernatural\nassistance in order to complete (some part of) its ordinary cognitive\nactivity. The assistance must be supernatural, of course, or\nit will not count as divine illumination. It must be\nspecial, in the sense that it must be something more than the\ndivine creation and ongoing conservation of the human mind. (If this\nby itself were to count as illumination, then all theists would be\ncommitted to the theory of divine illumination.) The mind must\nregularly rely on this assistance, in order to complete its\nordinary cognitive activity: otherwise, an occasional mystical\nexperience might suffice to confirm a theory of divine illumination.\nBut a defender of the theory need hold only that we require this\nassistance for some part of our ordinary cognitive activities:\nhardly anyone has supposed that every form of human cognition requires\ndivine illumination.\n\n\nIt is useful to think of divine illumination as analogous to grace.\nJust as a proponent of grace postulates a special divine role on the\nvolitional side, so a proponent of divine illumination postulates a\nspecial divine role on the cognitive side. Grace is intended as an\nexplanation not of all human desires and motivations, nor even of all\nvirtuous desires and motivations. Rather, the proponent of grace holds\nthat there is a certain class of volitional states, crucial to human\nwell-being, that we can achieve only with special divine assistance.\nLikewise, the theory of divine illumination is intended as an\nexplanation not of all belief, nor even of all knowledge. Rather, the\ntheory holds that there are certain kinds of knowledge, crucial to\ncognitive development, that we can achieve only with special divine\nassistance. It is an odd fact that, despite the close analogy, grace is\nregarded not as a philosophical question, but as a theological one. It\nis an equally odd fact that, whereas divine illumination hasn\u2019t\ngenerally been regarded as plausible since the thirteenth century,\ngrace continues to be taken seriously by many theologians. Perhaps both\nof these facts can be accounted for by motivational psychology\u2019s\nrelative obscurity in comparison to cognitive psychology.\n\n\nFor most people today it is hard to take divine illumination\nseriously, hard to view it as anything other than a quaint relic. A\nfirst step toward developing a proper perspective on the theory is to\nsee it in its broader context, not as peculiarly Christian or\nmedieval, but as an assumption shared by most premodern\nphilosophers. A second step in the same direction is to identify and\nto take seriously the philosophical problem that drives illumination\ntheory. In large part, the theory has been invoked to explain rational\ninsight \u2014 that is, a priori knowledge. For much of the modern era,\nphilosophers have been preoccupied with empirical knowledge and have\nnot had much interest in this topic. (Recently, this situation has\nchanged notably; for foundational recent treatments, see Bealer 2000\nand Bonjour 1998.) To see how something like divine illumination could\nhave ever seemed at all plausible, one has to see how deeply puzzling\nthe phenomenon of rational insight actually is. One way of seeing\nthis, and of seeing how little we understand rational insight, is to\nlook at cases where something goes wrong. A recent biography of the\nNobel-prize winning mathematician John Nash describes his long period\nof mental illness, during which time he held various odd beliefs such\nas that extraterrestrials were recruiting him to save the world. How\ncould he believe this, a friend asked during a hospital visit, given\nhis devotion to reason and logic?\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable\nsouthern drawl, as if talking to himself, \u201cthe ideas I had about\nsupernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas\ndid. So I took them seriously\u201d (Nasar 1998, p.11).\n\n\nIn a case such as this we don\u2019t know what to do, because we are\naccustomed to give unhesitating trust to the deliverances of pure\nreason. But why should we trust reason in this way? Why should we have\nconfidence that others can come to share our insights? Where does it\ncome from? The theory of divine illumination attempts to answer such\nquestions. \n",
