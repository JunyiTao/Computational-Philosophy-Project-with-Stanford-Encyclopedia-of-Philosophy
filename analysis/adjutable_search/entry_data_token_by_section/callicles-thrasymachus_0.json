    "main_text": "Justice\n1. Justice\n\nWhat exactly is it that both Thrasymachus and Callicles reject? Greek\nhandily distinguishes between \u2018justice\u2019 as a virtue\n[dikaiosun\u00ea] and the abstractions \u2018justice\u2019\n[dik\u00ea, sometimes personified as a goddess] and\n\u2018the just\u2019 [or \u2018what is just\u2019, to\ndikaion, the neuter form of the adjective \u2018just\u2019,\nmasc. dikaios]. The history of these concepts is complex, and\nit would be wrong to assume that Greek moral concepts were ever neatly\ndefined or uncontested. Still, Hesiod\u2019s Works and Days\n(c. 700 B.C.E.), a very early and canonical text for traditional Greek\nmoral thought, provides a useful baseline for later debates. Hesiod\ndoes not define justice, but the injustices he denounces include\nbribery, oath-breaking, perjury, theft, fraud, and the rendering of\ncrooked verdicts by judges. There are two kinds of underlying unity to\nthis list, each of which relates justice to another central concept in\nancient Greek ethics. First, all such actions are prohibited by\nnomos. This crucial term may be translated either\n\u2018law\u2019 or \u2018convention\u2019, depending on the\ncontext; nomoi include not only written statutes but\nunwritten laws and traditional, socially enforced norms of behavior.\nHesiod\u2019s just man is above all a law-abiding one, and the\nassociation of justice and nomos runs deep in Greek thought.\nHowever, nomos is also an ambiguous and open-ended concept:\nin the fifth century B.C.E. sophistic thinkers come to use it with the\nvery different sense of mere convention\u2014or, as we might now\nsay, social construction\u2014and this development is an important\npart of the background to immoralism. The second common denominator of\nHesiodic injustice is that unjust actions are ones typically prompted\nby pleonexia, best translated \u2018greed\u2019 (see Balot\n2001). The unjust man is motivated by the desire to have more\n[pleon echein]: more than he has, more than his neighbor has,\nmore than he is entitled to, and, ultimately, all there is to get.\nThese polarities of the lawful/unlawful and the restrained/greedy are\nlater used by Aristotle to structure his discussion of justice in\nNicomachean Ethics V, which is in many ways a rational\nreconstruction of traditional Greek thought about justice. \n\nHesiod also sets out the origins, authority, and rewards of justice.\nHere he is explicit: \n\nThe son of Kronos [i.e., Zeus] has set down this law [nomos]\nfor human beings:\n\nFish and animals and winged birds\n\nEat each other, since there is no justice [dik\u00ea] among\nthem.\n\nBut to humans he has given justice [dik\u00ea], which turns\nout the best\n\nBy far. And if one knows and is willing to proclaim what is just\n[ta dikaia],\n\nZeus far-sounding gives him wealth. (Works and Days 276\u201381)\n\n\nJustice derives from nomos in the sense of a divinely\nordained Law; and Hesiod emphasises that Zeus\u2019 laws are\nenforced. Punishment may not be visited directly on the unjust\nindividual, however: rather, a whole city suffers for the injustice of\nits leaders, and retribution may fall on a man\u2019s descendants.\nMoreover, Hesiod seems at one point to waver, and allows that if the\nwicked go unpunished, we would not have good reason to be just\n(270\u20133). Doubts about the reliability of divine rewards and\npunishments are later an important part of the motivation for the\nimmoralist challenge; in Republic Book II, Adeimantus\ncomplains that the poets are inconsistent on this point, and anyway\nthe rewards and punishments they promise do not show what is good and\nbad about justice and injustice in themselves (362d\u2013367e).\n\nHesiod represents only one side of early Greek moral thought. The\nother foundational poet of the Greek tradition, Homer, has less to say\nexplicitly about justice; more important for later debates is his\nbroader conception of aret\u00ea, which can equally well be\ntranslated \u2018virtue\u2019 or \u2018excellence\u2019. Justice\nis understood to be a part of aret\u00ea; or, as we would\nsay, it is a virtue. More particularly it is the virtue\ngoverning social interactions and good citizenship or leadership. In\nthe world of the Iliad and Odyssey,\naret\u00ea is understood as that set of skills and aptitudes\nwhich enables someone\u2014paradigmatically, a noble \nwarrior\u2014to function successfully in his social role. The key virtues\nof the Homeric warrior are courage and practical intelligence, which\nenable him to be an effective \u2018speaker of words and doer of\n deeds\u2019.[3]\n\n\nNow this \u2018functional\u2019 conception of virtue, as we may call\nit, can easily come into conflict with Hesiodic ideas about justice.\nIn Plato\u2019s Meno, Meno proposes an updated version of\nthe functional conception: a man\u2019s virtue consists in the\npolitical skills which enable him to harm his enemies and help his\nfriends, without incurring harm to himself (71e). Such a view would\nhave been at least intelligible to Homer\u2019s warriors; but it\nseems to involve giving up on Hesiodic principles of justice. When\nacting as a judge, does the virtuous man give verdicts in accordance\nwith the law, or does he give whatever verdicts (\u2018crooked\u2019\nones by Hesiod\u2019s standards) will harm his enemies or help his\nfriends? \n\nSo Plato\u2019s characters inherit a complex and not wholly coherent\nmoral tradition. Fifth-century moral debates were powerfully shaped by\nthe problematic relation of these \u2018functional\u2019 and\n\u2018Hesiodic\u2019 ideas about the virtues (see Adkins 1960); and\nthe Gorgias and Book I of the Republic locate\nCallicles and Thrasymachus in just this context. In the\nGorgias, Socrates\u2019 first interlocutor is the\nrhetorician Gorgias, who is led into self-contradiction by his\nunclarity on the question of whether his profession includes the\nteaching and practice of justice. His student Polus repudiates\nGorgias\u2019 pretensions to justice, and claims that while it may be\nmore admirable than injustice, injustice is more beneficial to its\npractitioner. Socrates shows that Polus\u2019 position too is\nultimately incoherent, and thus the stage is set for Callicles to\nreject justice (as conventionally understood) altogether, arguing that\nit is neither admirable nor beneficial. The Republic depicts\na strikingly similar dialectical progression, again from age to youth\nand from respectability to ruthlessness. It begins with a discussion\nbetween Socrates and the elderly, decent-seeming businessman Cephalus,\nwho offers (or at any rate assents to Socrates\u2019 suggestion of) a\nmarkedly \u2018Hesiodic\u2019 account of justice as telling the\ntruth and returning what one owes (331c). But Cephalus\u2019 son\nPolemarchus, on \u2018inheriting\u2019 the argument, glosses\nreturning what one owes in Meno-esque terms: justice is rendering help\nto one\u2019s friends and harm to one\u2019s enemies (332a\u2013b). We\nseem to move instantly from Hesiod to a degenerate version of the\n\u2018functional\u2019 conception, expressive of Athenian politics\nin an era of brutal, almost gangster-like factional strife. Neither\nCephalus nor Polemarchus seems to notice the conflict, but it runs\ndeep: justice cannot be at the same time (1) the Hesiodic virtue of\nthe good neighbour and solid citizen, involving obedience to law and\nthe restraint of pleonexia, and (2) a part of\naret\u00ea functionally understood, in a society in which\npleonexia and factional ruthlesssness are seen as the keys to\nsuccess. In sum, both the Gorgias and Book I of the\nRepublic reveal a society in some moral disorder, vulnerable\nto moral conflict and instability, with generational change used to\ndramatize a crumbling of Hesiodic norms. In both cases the upshot, to\nwhich Socrates must respond, is a fully formed challenge to justice\ntraditionally conceived. \n",
