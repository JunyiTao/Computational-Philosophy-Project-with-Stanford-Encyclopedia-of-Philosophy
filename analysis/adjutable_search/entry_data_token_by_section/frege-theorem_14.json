In\nGl, Frege sketched the derivations of the basic laws\nof number theory from Hume\u2019s Principle; these sketches were\ndeveloped into more rigorous proofs in Gg I. We will\nexamine these derivations in the following sections.\n\nOnce Frege had a contextual definition of \\(\\#F\\), he then defined a\ncardinal number as any object which is the number of some concept:\n\n\\(x \\textit{ is a cardinal number} \\eqdef \\exists F(x = \\#F)\\) \n\nThis represents the definition that appears in Gl,\n\u00a772.\n\nNotice that Hume\u2019s Principle bears an obvious formal resemblance\nto Basic Law V. Both are biconditionals asserting the equivalence of\nan identity among singular terms (the left-side condition) with an\nequivalence relation on concepts (the right-side condition). Indeed,\nboth correlate concepts with certain objects. In the case of\nHume\u2019s Principle, each concept \\(F\\) is correlated with \\(\\#F\\).\nHowever, whereas Basic Law V problematically requires that the\ncorrelation between concepts and extensions be one-to-one,\nHume\u2019s Principle only requires that the correlation between\nconcepts and numbers be many-to-one. Hume\u2019s Principle often\ncorrelates distinct concepts with the same number. For example, the\ndistinct concepts author of Principia Mathematica\n(\u2018\\([\\lambda x \\, Axp]\\)\u2019)\nand positive integer between 1\nand 4 (\u2018\\([\\lambda x \\, 1\\lt x\\lt 4]\\)\u2019) are\nequinumerous (both have two objects falling under them). So\n\\(\\#[\\lambda x\\, Axp]\\) = \\(\\#[\\lambda x \\, 1\\lt x\\lt 4]\\). Thus,\nHume\u2019s Principle, unlike Basic Law V, does not require that the\ndomain of numbers be as large as the domain of concepts. Indeed,\nseveral authors have developed models that show Hume\u2019s Principle\ncan be consistently added to second-order logic. See the independent\nwork of Geach (1976, 446\u20137), Hodes (1984, 138), Burgess (1984)\nand Hazen (1985).\n",
