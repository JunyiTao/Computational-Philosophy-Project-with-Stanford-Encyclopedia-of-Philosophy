The kind of family one has influences the kind of person one\ngrows up to be. In families, children first encounter concepts of\nright and wrong, as well as role models who shape their sense of what\nit is possible for them to do and be. Families are an important school\nof moral learning, but too many families teach inequality and\nsubordination, not principles of justice. Following Mill, feminist\nscholars question how children whose first experiences of adult\ninteraction are unequal altruism, domination and manipulation can\nlearn and accept the principles of justice they need to be citizens in\na democracy committed to the equal worth of all (Okin 1989).\n\n\nPlato also recognized the importance of the family for the moral\ndevelopment of individuals. Families inhibit or promote children's talents and abilities. In Book V of the Republic, Socrates\ndiscovers that when theorists of justice take into account the profound and often unfair effects\nof the family on the development of children's potentials , they will be forced to\nthe conclusion that the family must be abolished. While few feminists\nfollow Plato in proposing to abolish the family, almost all see the\nfamily as in need of reform.\n\n\nFamilies are schools of moral learning, but they are more than that.\nParents play an extremely large role in the lives of their dependent\nchildren. States need to regulate families to insure that all children\nare educated, are inoculated against contagious diseases and have\ntheir basic needs met. No state can be indifferent to whether or not\nchildren grow up to be literate, functioning members of its\neconomy. For this reason, all societies provide some degree of publicly financed education for children. All states also depend, at least in part, on the labor of\ncaretaking and childrearing, work that is today overwhelmingly done by\nwomen. Given its evident importance, why is domestic labor not given\ngreater public recognition? Feminists have made a strong case for\ntaking such care-giving within the family seriously, and for the state\nto attend to the justice issues involved in care provision (Kittay\n1999). Feminists have also argued that just states must provide care in\na way that ensures that all children \u2014 boys and girls,\nrich and poor \u2014 have equal opportunities to grow up able to take\npart in their society.\n",
