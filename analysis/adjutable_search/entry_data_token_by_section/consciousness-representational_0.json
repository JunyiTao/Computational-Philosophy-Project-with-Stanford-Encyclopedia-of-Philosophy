    "main_text": "Qualitative Character as Representation\n1. Qualitative Character as Representation\n\nQualitative properties and phenomenal features of mental states are\neach often called \u201cqualia\u201d (singular,\n\u201cquale\u201d). In recent philosophy of mind that term has been\nused in a number of confusingly different ways. There is a specific,\nfairly strict sense that comes to us from C.I. Lewis (1929) by way of\nGoodman (1951) (though there is plenty of room for exegetical\ndisagreement about Lewis\u2019 own usage). A quale in this sense is a\nqualitative property inhering in a sensory state: the color of an\nafter-image, or that of a more ordinary patch in one\u2019s visual\nfield; the pitch or volume or timbre of a subjectively heard sound;\nthe smell of an odor; a particular taste; the perceived texture of an\nobject encountered by touch. (The term \u201cinhering in\u201d in\nthe preceding sentence is deliberately vague, and neutral on as many\nmetaphysical issues as possible. In particular, qualia may be\nproperties of the experiences in which they inhere, or they\nmay be related to those experiences in some other way.) For reasons\nthat will become clear, we may call this sense of \u201cqualia\u201d\nthe \u201cfirst-order\u201d sense. Notice that it differs from the\nbroader and vaguer sense defined in the entry on\n qualia\n (\u201cthe introspectively accessible, phenomenal aspects of our\nmental lives\u201d), and from the much more heavily laden\nsense of Block (1990, 1995, 1996), according to which\n\u201cqualia\u201d are by stipulative definition neither functional\nnor intentional properties. To avoid further confusion, let us speak\nof sensory qualities.\n\nA sensory quality can be thought of as the distinctive property of an\napparent phenomenal individual. An \u201capparent phenomenal\nindividual\u201d is anything of the sort that Bertrand Russell would\nhave taken to be a \u201csense-datum,\u201d such as (again) a\ncolored region of one\u2019s visual field, or a heard sound or an\nexperienced smell. But it is important to see that qualities of this\nkind do not presuppose the existence of sense-data or other exotica.\nSensory fields are pervaded by such qualities both in everyday\nveridical experience and in less usual cases. In our first-order sense\nof the \u201cq\u201d-word, the latter point is the merest common\nsense, and to deny it would be to take a very radical position. Of\ncourse philosophers will immediately debate the nature of these\ncommonsensical qualities and further claims about them, but it is\ngenerally agreed that that they are introspectible,\napparently monadic or nonrelational, and describable in\nordinary English words such as \u201cgreen,\u201d\n\u201cloud,\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d (though it may be\nquestioned whether those words have just the same senses as when they\nare applied to physical objects and events).\n\nSensory qualities pose a serious problem for materialist theories of\nthe mind. For where, ontologically speaking, are they located? Suppose\nBertie is experiencing a green after-image as a result of seeing a red\nflash bulb go off; the greenness of the after-image is the quality.\nActual Russellian sense-data are immaterial individuals; so the\nmaterialist cannot admit that the greenness of the after-image is a\nproperty of an actual sense-datum. Nor is it plausible to suggest that\nthe greenness is exemplified by anything physical in the brain (if\nthere is some green physical thing in your brain, you are probably in\nbig trouble). To sharpen the problem:\n\nBertie is experiencing a green thing.\nSuppose that there is no physical green thing outside\nBertie\u2019s head. But\nThere is no physical green thing inside Bertie\u2019s head\neither.\nIf it is physical, the green thing is either outside\nBertie\u2019s head or inside it. Thus,\nThe green thing is not physical. [1,2,3,4] Thus,\nBertie\u2019s experience contains a nonphysical thing. [1,5]\nThus,\nBertie\u2019s experience is not, or not entirely, physical.\n[6]\n\n\nThis is a valid deductive argument against materialism, and its\npremises are hard to deny.\n\nThe modern representational theory of sensory qualities originates\nwith Hall (1961), Anscombe(1965) and Hintikka (1969); early adherents\ninclude Kraut (1982), Lewis (1983), Lycan (1987, 1996), Harman (1990),\nShoemaker (1994), Tye (1994, 1995, 2003a), Dretske (1995), Clark\n(2000), Byrne (2001), Crane (2001, 2003), and Thau (2002). The\nrepresentational theory is usually (though not always) an attempt to\nresolve the foregoing dilemma compatibly with materialism. According\nto the theory, sensory qualities are actually intentional contents,\nrepresented properties of represented objects. Suppose Ludwig is\nseeing a real tomato in good light, and naturally it looks red to him;\nthere is a corresponding red patch in his visual field. He is visually\nrepresenting the actual redness of the tomato, and the redness of the\n\u201cpatch\u201d is just the redness of the tomato itself. But\nsuppose George Edward is hallucinating a similar tomato, and there is\na tomato-shaped red patch in his visual field just as there is in\nLudwig\u2019s. George Edward too is representing the redness of an\nexternal, physical tomato. It is just that in his case the tomato is\nnot real; it and its redness are nonactual intentional contents. But\nthe redness is still the redness of the illusory tomato. (Note that\nthe representation going on here is good old first-order\nrepresentation of environmental features, not higher-order as in the\n\u201chigher-order representation\u201d theories of awareness.)\n\nWhat about Bertie\u2019s green after-image? On the\nrepresentationalist (sometimes \u201cintentionalist\u201d) analysis,\nfor Bertie to experience the green after-image is for Bertie to be\nvisually representing a green blob located at such-and-such a spot in\nthe room. Since in reality there is no green blob in the room with\nBertie, his visual experience is unveridical; after-images are\nillusions. The sensory quality, the greenness of the blob, is (like\nthe blob itself) a nonactual intentional content. Of course, in cases\nof veridical perception, the color and the colored object are not\nmerely intentional contents, because they actually exist, but\nthey are still intentional objects, representata.\n\nAnd that is how the representationalist resolves our dilemma. As P1\nhas it, there is a green thing that Bertie is experiencing, but it is\nnot an actual thing. That \u201cthere is\u201d is the same lenient\nnon-actualist \u201cthere is\u201d that occurs in \u201cThere is\nsomething that Bertie believes in but that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d\nand in \u201cThere is at least one mythical god that the Greeks\nworshipped but that no one worships anymore.\u201d (In defending his\nsense-data, Russell mistook a nonactual material thing for an actual\nimmaterial thing.) Thus, P5, understood as delivering an\nactual green entity, does not follow.\n\nA slightly surprising but harmless consequence of the representational\nview as formulated here is that sensory qualities\n(\u201cqualia\u201d in our strict first-order sense) are not\nthemselves properties of the experiences that present them:\nSensory qualities are represented properties of represented objects,\nand so they are only intentionally present in experiences. The\nrelevant properties of the experiences are, representing this\nquality or that. Of course, one could shift the meaning slightly and\nspeak of \u201cqualia\u201d as properties of experiences,\nidentifying them with representational features, such as the feature\nof representing this strict-sense sensory quality or that; nothing\nmuch hangs on this terminological choice. (As before, \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d properties are something else again.)\n\nMost representationalists agree that the perceptual representation of\ncolor and other sensible properties is \u201cnonconceptual\u201d in\nsome sense\u2014at least in that the qualitative representations need\nnot be easily translatable into the subject\u2019s natural language.\nOf course, some psychosemantics would be needed to explain what it is\nin virtue of which a brain item represents greenness in particular.\nDretske (1995) offers one, as does Tye (1995); both accounts are\nteleologized versions of \u201cindicator\u201d semantics.\n",
