    "main_text": "The existentialist \u201csystem of the arts\u201d || The novel\n10.2 The novel\n\n\nThe novel comes very close to theatre as the art-form of choice for\nthe existentialists. For most existentialists, the ultimate models were\nnot philosophers, but contemporary novelists; two of whom were\nespecially paradigmatic, viz., Dostoievsky and Kafka. Sartre, de\nBeauvoir and Camus saw themselves in equal measure as writers of\nfiction and as philosophers. They engaged with each other\u2019s\nfictional work at least as much, if not more, than with their\ntheoretical one (Camus 1938b, 1939, Sartre 1943b). Indeed, as already\nnoted, fiction and autobiographical writings were direct applications\nof their philosophical visions. \u201cTo think is to create a\nworld,\u201d writes Camus, showing the deep identity between\nphilosophical and fictional creation (Camus 1942b, 87\u201391). The reason\nis the same as with theatre: narrative fiction, focused on a series of\n\u2018situations\u2019 in which the fundamental existential choices\nfacing human beings can be carefully staged, is a powerful mode of\nengaging the free imagination of the reader, and thus of calling him or\nher to action: \u201cWhat in fact is a novel but a universe in which\naction is endowed with form?\u201d (Camus 1951, 263). The novel is a\nrevelation of the world, notably in its social and political urgency,\nby a freedom for other freedoms. As Merleau-Ponty writes in\n\u201cMetaphysics and the Novel\u201d: \u201cIntellectual works had\nalways been concerned with establishing a certain attitude toward the\nworld, of which literature and philosophy, like politics, are just\ndifferent expressions; but only now [thanks to existentialist\nphilosophy] has this concern become explicit\u201d (Merleau-Ponty\n1945c, 27; see also Camus 1942b, 92 and 1951, 258\u2013267).\n\n\nIn existentialist aesthetics, artistic activity and its products\nhave external aims: to reveal the world to others, both in a\nmetaphysical and political sense. As noted, this aesthetic theory\ntherefore conflicts with the notion that the artwork is an end in\nitself, or that style and form are self-justified. Thus, the\nexistentialists were deeply suspicious of some of the main artistic\nmovements of the time, particularly Surrealism, even if some of them\nadmired its rebellious spirit (Camus 1951, 88\u2013100); or, later on, the\nNouveau Roman (Alain Robbe-Grillet, Nathalie Sarraute and\nClaude Simon) and the literature that was developed around the\npost-structuralist journal Tel Quel (de Beauvoir, in Francis\nand Gontier, 226, 233\u2013234). Compared with Dadaism, Surrealism, and the\nliterary avant-gardes that immediately followed the existentialist era,\nexistentialist aesthetics has an outdated, almost conservative air to\nit. It unabashedly calls for a new classicism somewhere between\nformalism and realism (either in its naturalist or socialist versions),\nand beyond romanticism (Camus 1944 and 1951, 268\u2013271), on the grounds\nthat the moral and political dimensions of literature consist not just\nin a rebellion against everyday language and the social-political order\nof the day, but also in the more demanding (yet modest) task of\nproperly naming the world in order to unveil the immense injustice\nreigning in it, while also retrieving its fleeting and inhuman beauty\n(Camus 1951, 272\u2013279). In his prolific work as literary critic, Sartre\nconsistently rejected formalism and \u201cart for art\u2019s\nsake,\u201d even in the case of illustrious French writers such as\nMallarm\u00e9 or Flaubert. However, it can also be argued that, from\nthe perspective of the relation between politics and arts in the\n20th century, the existentialist demand that art retain a\nstrong connection to everyday reality (so as to fulfil its moral and\npolitical roles) is also completely of its time.\n\n\nThe condemnation of \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d applies\nto all the arts and has important repercussions for aesthetic critique\nand the conception of style. The existentialists take great pains to\nnote that their rejection of formalism, purism and autotelism in the\narts does not amount to advocating a crude version of realism (Camus\n1951, 268\u2013270; Sartre 1948a, 44). As we have noted already in the case\nof theatre, the classical aspect of existentialist aesthetics impacts\non the choice of stylistic means: \u201cOne is not a writer for having\nchosen to say certain things, but for having chosen to say them in a\ncertain way. And to be sure, the style makes the value of the prose.\nBut it should pass unnoticed\u201d (Sartre 1948a, 15).\n\n\nFurthermore, the existentialist definitions of meaning as\nnegativity, and of expression as \u2018coherent distortion\u2019,\nmean that stylistic achievement (the ability to let new sense be\nrevealed) relies as much on the choice of words and syntax as on the\n\u2018silences\u2019 and omissions that define an expressive\ngesture.\n",
