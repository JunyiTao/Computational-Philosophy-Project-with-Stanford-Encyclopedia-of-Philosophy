    "main_text": "The epistemic value of empirical evidence || Confirmation\n4.1 Confirmation\n\nIt is natural to think that computability, range of application, and\nother things being equal, true theories are better than false ones,\ngood approximations are better than bad ones, and highly probable\ntheoretical claims are better than less probable ones. One way to\ndecide whether a theory or a theoretical claim is true, close to the\ntruth, or acceptably probable is to derive predictions from it and use\nempirical data to evaluate them. Hypothetico-Deductive (HD)\nconfirmation theorists proposed that empirical evidence argues for\nthe truth of theories whose deductive consequences it verifies, and\nagainst those whose consequences it falsifies (Popper 1959, 32\u201334).\nBut laws and theoretical generalization seldom if ever entail\nobservational predictions unless they are conjoined with one or more\nauxiliary hypotheses taken from the theory they belong to. When the\nprediction turns out to be false, HD has trouble explaining which of\nthe conjuncts is to blame. If a theory entails a true prediction, it\nwill continue to do so in conjunction with arbitrarily selected\nirrelevant claims. HD has trouble explaining why the prediction does\nnot confirm the irrelevancies along with the theory of interest.\n\nAnother approach to confirmation by empirical evidence is Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE). The idea is roughly that an explanation of the evidence that exhibits certain desirable characteristics with respect to a family of candidate explanations is likely to be the true on (Lipton 1991). On this approach, it is in virtue of their successful explanation of the empirical evidence that theoretical claims are supported. Naturally, IBE advocates face the challenges of defending a suitable characterization of what counts as the \u2018best\u2019 and of justifying the limited pool of candidate explanations considered (Stanford 2006).\n\nBayesian approaches to scientific confirmation have garnered significant attention and are now widespread in philosophy of science. Bayesians hold that the evidential bearing of empirical evidence on a theoretical claim is to be understood in terms of likelihood or conditional probability. For example, whether empirical evidence\nargues for a theoretical claim might be thought to depend upon whether\nit is more probable (and if so how much more probable) than its denial\nconditional on a description of the evidence together with background\nbeliefs, including theoretical commitments. But by Bayes\u2019\nTheorem, the posterior probability of the claim of interest (that is, its probability given the evidence) is proportional to that claim\u2019s prior probability. How to justify the choice of these prior probability assignments is one of the most notorious points of contention arising for Bayesians. If one makes the assignment of priors a subjective matter decided by epistemic agents, then it is not clear that they can be justified. Once again, one\u2019s use of evidence to evaluate a theory depends in part upon one\u2019s theoretical commitments (Earman 1992, 33\u201386; Roush 2005, 149\u2013186). If one instead appeals to chains of successive updating using Bayes\u2019 Theorem based on past evidence, one has to invoke assumptions that generally do not obtain in actual scientific reasoning. For instance, to \u2018wash out\u2019 the influence of priors a limit theorem is invoked wherein we consider very many updating iterations, but much scientific reasoning of interest does not happen in the limit, and so in practice priors hold unjustified sway (Norton 2021, 33).\n\nRather than attempting to cast all instances of confirmation based on empirical evidence as belonging to a universal schema, a better approach may be to \u2018go local\u2019. Norton\u2019s material theory of induction argues that inductive support arises from background knowledge, that is, from material facts that are domain specific. Norton argues that, for instance, the induction from \u201cSome samples of the element bismuth melt at 271\u00b0C\u201d to \u201call samples of the element bismuth melt at 271\u00b0C\u201d is admissible not in virtue of some universal schema that carries us from \u2018some\u2019 to \u2018all\u2019 but matters of fact (Norton 2003). In this particular case, the fact that licenses the induction is a fact about elements: \u201ctheir samples are generally uniform in their physical properties\u201d (ibid., 650). This is a fact pertinent to chemical elements, but not to samples of material like wax (ibid.). Thus Norton repeatedly emphasizes that \u201call induction is local\u201d.\n    \nStill, there are those who may be skeptical about the very possibility of confirmation or of successful induction. Insofar as the bearing of evidence on theory is never totally decisive, insofar there is no single trusty universal schema that captures empirical support, perhaps the relationship between empirical evidence and scientific theory is not really about support after all. Giving up on empirical support would not automatically mean abandoning any epistemic value for empirical evidence. Rather than confirm theory, the epistemic role of evidence could be to constrain, for example by furnishing phenomena for theory to systematize or to adequately model.\n\n",
