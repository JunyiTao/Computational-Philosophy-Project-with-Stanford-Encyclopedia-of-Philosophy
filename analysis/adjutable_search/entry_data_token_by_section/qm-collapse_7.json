Pais famously recalls in his biography of Einstein: \n\n\nWe often discussed his notions on objective reality. I recall that\nduring one walk Einstein suddenly stopped, turned to me and asked\nwhether I really believed that the moon exists only when I look at it.\n(Pais 1982: 5)\n\n\nIn the context of Einstein\u2019s remarks in Albert Einstein,\nPhilosopher-Scientist (Schilpp 1949), we can regard this\nreference to the moon as an extreme example of \u2018a fact that\nbelongs entirely within the sphere of macroscopic concepts\u2019, as\nis also a mark on a strip of paper that is used to register the\noutcome of a decay experiment, so that \n\n\nas a consequence, there is hardly likely to be anyone who would be\ninclined to consider seriously [\u2026] that the existence of the\nlocation is essentially dependent upon the carrying out of an\nobservation made on the registration strip. For, in the macroscopic\nsphere it simply is considered certain that one must adhere to the\nprogram of a realistic description in space and time; whereas in the\nsphere of microscopic situations one is more readily inclined to give\nup, or at least to modify, this program. (1949: 671)\n\n\nHowever, \n\n\nthe \u2018macroscopic\u2019 and the \u2018microscopic\u2019 are so\ninter-related that it appears impracticable to give up this program in\nthe \u2018microscopic\u2019 alone. (1949: 674)\n\n\nOne might speculate that Einstein would not have taken the DRP\nseriously, given that it is a fundamentally indeterministic program.\nOn the other hand, the DRP allows precisely for this middle ground,\nbetween giving up a \u2018classical description in space and\ntime\u2019 altogether (the moon is not there when nobody looks), and\nrequiring that it be applicable also at the microscopic level (as\nwithin some kind of \u2018hidden variables\u2019 theory). It would\nseem that the pursuit of \u2018realism\u2019 for Einstein was more a\nprogram that had been very successful rather than an a priori\ncommitment, and that in principle he would have accepted attempts\nrequiring a radical change in our classical conceptions concerning\nmicrosystems, provided they would nevertheless allow to take a\nmacrorealist position matching our definite perceptions at this\nscale.\n\nIn the DRP, we can say of an electron in an EPR-Bohm situation that\n\u2018when nobody looks\u2019, it has no definite spin in any\ndirection , and in particular that when it is in a superposition of\ntwo states localised far away from each other, it cannot be thought to\nbe at a definite place (see, however, the remarks in Section 11). In\nthe macrorealm, however, objects do have definite positions and are\ngenerally describable in classical terms. That is, in spite of the\nfact that the DRP program is not adding \u2018hidden variables\u2019\nto the theory, it implies that the moon is definitely there even if no\nsentient being looks at it. In the words of J. S. Bell, the DRP\n\n\nallows electrons (in general microsystems) to enjoy the cloudiness of\nwaves, while allowing tables and chairs, and ourselves, and black\nmarks on photographs, to be rather definitely in one place rather than\nanother, and to be described in classical terms. (Bell 1989a: 364)\n\n\nSuch a program, as we have seen, is implemented by assuming only the\nexistence of wave functions, and by proposing a unified dynamics that\ngoverns both microscopic processes and \u2018measurements\u2019.\nWith reference to the latter, no vague definitions are needed. The new\ndynamical equations govern the unfolding of any physical process, and\nthe macroscopic ambiguities that would arise from the linear evolution\nare theoretically possible, but only of momentary duration, of no\npractical importance and no source of embarrassment.\n\nWe have not yet analyzed the implications about locality, but since in\nthe DRP program no hidden variables are introduced, the situation can\nbe no worse than in ordinary quantum mechanics: \u2018by adding\nmathematical precision to the jumps in the wave function\u2019,\nthe GRW theory \u2018simply makes precise the action at a\ndistance of ordinary quantum mechanics\u2019 (Bell 1987: 46).\nIndeed, a detailed investigation of the locality properties of the\ntheory becomes possible as shown by Bell himself (Bell 1987: 47).\nMoreover, as it will become clear when we will discuss the\ninterpretation of the theory in terms of mass density, the QMSL and\nCSL theories naturally account for the behaviour of macroscopic\nobjects, corresponding to our definite perceptions about them, the\nmain objective of Einstein\u2019s requirements.\n\nThe achievements of the DRP which are relevant for the debate about\nthe foundations of quantum mechanics can also be concisely summarized\nin the words of H.P. Stapp:\n\n\nThe collapse mechanisms so far proposed could, on the one hand, be\nviewed as ad hoc mutilations designed to force ontology to kneel to\nprejudice. On the other hand, these proposals show that one can\ncertainly erect a coherent quantum ontology that generally conforms to\nordinary ideas at the macroscopic level. (Stapp 1989: 157)\n\n",
