    "main_text": "\n\nEpistemologists are interested in the norms governing the structure\nand dynamics of systems of belief: how an individual's beliefs must\ncohere in order to be considered rational; how they must be reflected\nin decision making; and how they ought to accommodate new evidence.\nFormal epistemologists pursue these questions by constructing\nmathematical models, or \u201cformal representations,\u201d of\nbelief systems that are, in some sense, epistemically exemplary.\nBroadly speaking, these models capture something important about how\nan ideally rational agent would manage her epistemic life. This entry\ngives an overview of the formal representations that have been\nproposed for this purpose.\n\nBelief comes in a qualitative (full) form, as when Sophia believes\nthat Vienna is the capital of Austria, and a quantitative (partial)\nform, as when Sophia's belief that Vienna is the capital of Austria is\nstronger, in some sense, than her belief that Vienna is more populous\nthan Budapest. The question of how full and partial belief are related\nhas received considerable attention in formal epistemology, giving\nrise to several subtle, elegant and, unfortunately, incompatible\nsolutions. The debate between these alternatives is a particular focus\nof this entry, covered in Section 4. \n",
