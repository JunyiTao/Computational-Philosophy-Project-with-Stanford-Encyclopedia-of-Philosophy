Following the war, he, along with Merleau-Ponty and Beauvoir,\nlaunched the influential journal of social criticism Le Temps\nModernes (Modern Times), and Sartre made his aims clear in the\nfirst issue, writing: \u201cOur intention is to help effect certain\nchanges in the Society that surrounds us\u2026 one is responsible for\nwhat one is \u2026 Totally committed and totally freed. And yet it is\nthe free man who must be delivered, by enlarging his\npossibilities of choice\u201d (Sartre 1945 [1988, 264\u201365]). Here we\nsee existentialists making the connection that for the Other to realize\ntheir freedom, philosophy must engage the \u201cbases and\nstructures\u201d that limit and constrain them. This is because these\nstructures are not philosophical abstractions; they \u201care lived as\nschematic determinates of the individual\u2019s future\u201d (Sartre\n1957 [1968, 94]). Society, here, is viewed not as an aggregate of\nvoluntaristic subjects; it is the mediating background of our lives,\nand if we are going to create a situation of freedom and \u201cenlarge\nthe possibilities of choice,\u201d we must recognize how this\nbackground can be violent and oppressive\u2014especially to\nhistorically marginalized and undervalued people\u2014and to act in\nsuch a way as to transform it.\n\n\nOf all the major developers of existentialism, it is unquestionably\nBeauvoir who offered the most sustained and influential analyses of\noppression and of possibilities for emancipation, not only in her\nfeminist masterwork The Second Sex, but in her bleak account\nof the dehumanization of the elderly in The Coming of Age\n(1970 [1996]) and her reflections on the experience of Black\npopulations in the Jim Crow South in her memoir America Day by\nDay (1954 [1999]). In these works, Beauvoir illuminates how\nsocioeconomic and political structures can restrict the human capacity\nfor freedom and transcendence, how they have the power to\n\u201cfreeze\u201d the Other, strip away possibilities for agency and\nself-creation, and trap them in \u201cimmanence.\u201d But in these\nworks, Beauvoir makes it clear that this situation is not a destiny.\nHuman beings have no essential nature; no one is born inferior or\nsubmissive. We are constituted intersubjectively by growing into,\ninternalizing, and enacting ready-made structures of oppression. But\ninsofar as these structures are constituted and maintained by the\nchoices and actions of individuals, they are not fixed and static. Like\nhuman beings, they too are subject to change. Here we see how the\nrecognition that existence precedes essence moves from the ontological\nrealm to the ethical, it becomes a call to action, to engage and\ntransform the material conditions that limit the possibilities of\nchoice for those who are oppressed and marginalized.\n\nIn this way, postwar existentialism began to engage the realities of\nthe social sphere and the painful \u201cisms\u201d\u2014classism,\nracism, colonialism, sexism, anti-Semitism\u2014haunting the western\nworld. It was a philosophy that had come to recognize, in\nSartre\u2019s words, that \u201cthe individual interiorizes his\nsocial determinations; he interiorizes the relations of production, the\nfamily of his childhood, the historical past, the contemporary in\ninstitutions, and he then re-exteriorizes these acts and options which\nnecessarily refer us back to them\u201d (1972 [2008, 35]). And insofar\nas these social determinations are not fixed and timeless but\ncontingent human constructs, they can be resisted and transformed to\nfree others. \n",
