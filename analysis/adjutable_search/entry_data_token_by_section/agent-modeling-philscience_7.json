    "main_text": "Central Research Questions || Scientific polarization\n2.6 Scientific polarization\n\nClosely related to the issue of scientific disagreements is the\nproblem of scientific polarization. While scientific controversies\ntypically resolve over time, they may include periods of polarization,\nwith different parts of the community maintaining mutually conflicting\nattitudes even after an extensive debate. But how and why does\npolarization emerge? Do scientific communities polarize only if\nscientists are too dogmatic or biased towards their viewpoints, or can\npolarization emerge even among rational agents?\n\nFollowing a range of formal models in social and political sciences\naddressing a similar issue in society at large (for a review see\nBramson et al. 2017), ABMs have been used to examine the emergence of\npolarization in the context of science. What makes agent-based\nmodeling particularly apt for this task is not only that we can model\ndifferent aspects of individual inquiry that may contribute to the\nemergence of polarization (such as different background beliefs,\ndifferent communication networks, different trust relationships, and\nso on), but we can also observe the formation of polarized states,\ntheir duration (as stable or temporary states throughout the inquiry)\nand their features (such as the distribution of scientists across the\nopposing views). We will look at the models studying these issues in\n Section 4.6.\n",
