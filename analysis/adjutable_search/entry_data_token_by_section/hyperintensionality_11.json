    "main_text": "General Approaches to Hyperintensionality || Relevance/Relevant Logic\n4.4 Relevance/Relevant Logic\n\nOne should look at the SEP entry on\n relevance logic\n (also called \u201crelevant logic\u201d) for an introduction to\nthis research program (see the seminal Anderson & Belnap 1975;\nAnderson, Belnap, & Dunn 1992; and, for a comprehensive\nintroduction, Dunn & Restall 2002). We briefly discuss its\nconnections to hyperintensionality here. Its origins lay in the aim to\ndevelop logical systems free from the \u201cparadoxes of the material\nand strict conditional\u201d discussed above. Another early\nmotivation was to construct a conditional that could represent logical\ndeducibility within the logical language itself.\n\nIn this program, an agreed upon necessary (though, in general, not\nsufficient) condition for a conditional to be logically valid is that\nthere be some connection between antecedent and consequent.\nHistorically, this has often been phrased via a requirement called the\nVariable Sharing Property (VSP): \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is valid\nonly when \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) share some sentential variable or parameter\n(cf. Anderson & Belnap 1975: 32\u20133). VSP delivers\nhyperintensional distinctions: conditionals with (classically)\nimpossible antecedents and necessary consequents are not all trivially\nvalid or true. The infamous ex falso quodlibet, \\((A \\land\n\\neg A) \\rightarrow B\\), for instance, fails (it\u2019s not the case\nthat anything is implied by a contradiction); whereas \\((A \\land \\neg\nA) \\rightarrow A\\) holds in most mainstream relevant systems\n(plausibly, a conjunction relevantly implies its conjuncts).\n\nA key feature of relevance logics, made apparent by their most\ndeveloped semantics, the so-called Routley-Meyer frames (Routley &\nMeyer 1973), is that hyperintensional distinctions are not achieved by\nsuperimposing on an essentially classical or normal modal logic a\nfilter that screens out irrelevancies. Relevance logics are weaker\nthan normal modal logics with SPWS or Kripke frames because their\nsemantics embeds points of evaluation for formulas different from\nclassical (maximally consistent) possible worlds, which are accessible\n(via a ternary accessibility relation, different from the\nbinary accessibility of Kripke frames) in the evaluation of\nconditionals.\n\nWorking out the intuitive interpretation of such points, of the\nternary relation, and indeed of the Routley-Mayer semantics as a\nwhole, has been a difficult task in the history of this research\nprogramme (see Copeland 1980; Read 1988; Restall 1996b; Mares 2004).\nThe consensus on the points nowadays seems to be that they be\nunderstood as non-normal or logically impossible worlds (see Priest\n2008: Ch, 10; Berto & Jago 2019: Ch. 6). See the SEP entry on\n impossible worlds\n for details. The impossible worlds of (the interpreted) Routley-Meyer\nframes can be seen as situations which can, e.g., be locally\ninconsistent (making true both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\), for some \\(A)\\)\nwithout thereby being trivial (making true everything), and partial or\nlocally incomplete (\u201ctaking no stance\u201d on some \\(A\\) by\nmaking true neither it nor its negation).\n\nThe conditional of most mainstream relevant systems is taken as\nrepresenting implication or (necessary) entailment, not a ceteris\nparibus or counterfactual conditional. But some of the first\ntheories of counterpossible conditionals, addressing the limitations\nof the Lewis/Stalnaker account of counterfactuals, were developed\nagainst a relevance logic background: see Routley (1989); Mares and\nFuhrmann (1995), and Mares (1997).\n\nOther applications of relevance logic to areas where hyperintensional\ndistinctions seem needed include applications to the theory of\nconfirmation in science (Goddard 1977; Sylvan & Nola 1991); the\nlogic of fiction (Routley 1979); and the theory of information (Mares\n2004; Dunn 2015). Finally, a number of theories in deontic logic have\nbeen offered using a relevance logic base, including Anderson (1967),\nGoble (1999) and Tagawa and Cheng (2002).\n\nRelevance logic has also been deployed to give theories of\nworldly hyperintensionality. In a series of papers, Michael\nDunn developed a theory of relevant predication intended to\nilluminate a range of traditional metaphysical distinctions, including\nthe differences between intrinsic and extrinsic properties, essential\nand accidental properties, and between essential properties and\nproperties necessarily had when an object exists (Dunn 1987, 1990a,\n1990b). And as mentioned above, Restall (1996a) employed relevant\nlogic to offer a theory of truthmakers.\n\nOverall, the tools provided by the relevance logic program offer\ntheoretical resources for constructing theories of hyperintensional\nphenomena, whether representational or non-representational. To date,\nmany of these proposals have been piece-meal, with less of a general\nstory about how these techniques could be applied to handle\nhyperintensional language across the board. Some general strategies\nhave been outlined for how a theory could be constructed that handles\nall hyperintensional phenomena: one such program was Richard\nRoutley\u2019s \u201cUltralogic as Universal\u201d, first set out\nin Routley (1977). See Nolan (2018) and the essays in Routley (2019)\nfor recent evaluations.\n",
