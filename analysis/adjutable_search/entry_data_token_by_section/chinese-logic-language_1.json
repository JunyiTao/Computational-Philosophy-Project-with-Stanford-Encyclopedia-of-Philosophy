    "main_text": "Confucius and the Ordering of Names\n2. Confucius and the Ordering of Names\n\nThe Mohists are generally credited with the first systematic study of\nlanguage in ancient China, but the inspiration for putting language at\nthe center of philosophical thought certainly comes from Confucius\n(551?\u2013479? BCE). Against prevailing skepticism and apathy,\nConfucius insisted that the correct use of language is essential to\nthe order and harmony of society, and that the conditions by which\nlanguage is correctly used devolve upon determining how names\n(ming) designate objects, events, and actions. However, the\ncorrect use of names is not simply a matter of attaching labels to a\npreexisting domain of things independent of human affairs. That is, it\nis commonly recognized that Confucius viewed language as having not\nsimply a descriptive function, but a fundamentally performative one as\nwell. Attributing names to objects is not a matter of describing the\nworld, but of influencing it in a way that causes certain modes of\ninteraction and existence to be realized. One can do this poorly,\ncontributing to the degradation of social relationships and\none\u2019s relationship with nature, or skillfully, in a way that\ncontributes to social harmony and prosperity. The skillful use of\nlanguage depends on the extent to which one\u2019s use of it reflects\na conscientious awareness of the meanings and values that are\nessential to acting effectively. This goes hand-in-hand with the\nrealization that acting on behalf of these meanings and values is\nitself constitutive of the very relational efficacy one seeks to\nestablish.\n\nIn understanding this performative aspect of language one can\nappreciate why Confucius held that the ordering of society must begin\nwith the ordering of names. A famous exchange in the Analects\nexplains:\n\n\n\u201cWere the Lord of Wey to turn the administration of his state\nover to you, what would be your first priority?\u201d asked Zilu.\n\n\u201cWithout question it would be to insure that names are used\nproperly (zheng ming)\u201d, replied the Master.\n\n\u201cWould you be as impractical as that?\u201d responded Zilu.\n\u201cWhat is it for names to be used properly anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow you can be so dense!\u201d replied Confucius. \u201cAn\nexemplary person (junzi) defers on matters he does not\nunderstand. When names are not used properly, language will not be\nused effectively; when language is not used effectively, matters will\nnot be taken care of; when matters are not taken care of, the\nobservance of ritual propriety (li) and the playing of music\n(yue) will not flourish; when the observance of ritual\npropriety and the playing of music do not flourish, the application of\nlaws and punishment will not be on the mark; when the application of\nlaws and punishments is not on the mark, the people will not know what\nto do with themselves. Thus, when the exemplary person puts a name to\nsomething, it can certainly be spoken, and when spoken it can\ncertainly be acted upon. There is nothing careless in the attitude of\nthe exemplary person toward what is said\u201d. (Analects\n13.3; tr. Ames and Rosemont 1998)\n\n\nScholars have often translated Confucius\u2019 expression cheng\nming as \u201crectification of names\u201d, but this\ntranslation has been widely supplanted with \u201cordering of\nnames\u201d to more explicitly reflect the continuously dynamic and\ncreative aspects of language use. Hall and Ames favor this latter\ntranslation, objecting to the former\u2019s suggestion that the\ncorrect use of names is a matter of conforming to preexisting\nconventions of proper use, \u201crectifying\u201d one\u2019s\nbehavior in light of these conventions. The moral dilemmas we face are\ncontext-dependent and continuously undergoing transformation, so\neffective moral action must be motivated by an awareness of these\ncontexts and assume different courses where appropriate. Accordingly,\nwhile the Confucian ideal of moral conduct involves an unflagging\nrespect for cultural institutions and the rituals embodied in them, it\nalso requires \u201cselectivity and creative synthesis\u201d, and\nthe recognition that \u201cinherited wisdom and institutions must be\nconstantly revamped to accommodate the shifting circumstances of an\nalways unique world\u201d (Hall and Ames 1987: 271\u20132).\n\nAlthough this doctrine brought language to the forefront of\nphilosophical inquiry, systematic debate on its function and\nproper use did not begin until the Mohists gained prominence as\nConfucianism\u2019s chief adversary. Departing from Confucian\northodoxy, the Mohists endeavored to justify their ethical views\nindependently of established customs on the basis of general\nprinciples, the articulation of which demanded a comprehensive theory\nof naming and reference.\n",
