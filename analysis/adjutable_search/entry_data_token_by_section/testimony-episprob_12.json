    "main_text": "Individualism and Anti-Individualism || Individualism\n4.1 Individualism\n\nSuppose that Amanda tells Scott that the roller rink is open (=\np) and that Scott thereby acquires testimonial justification\nfor believing that p.\n\nTo get a grip on one version of Individualism, recall the Reductionist\nviews discussed in\n Section 1.1.\n According to Reductionists, testimonial justification consists in an\ninference that the hearer makes, i.e., the hearer\u2019s inference\nfrom the claim that (a) the speaker said that p to the\nconclusion that (b) p is true. Thus, Reductionists are\nIndividualists in the following sense: they maintain that whether or\nnot a hearer acquires testimonial justification for believing p\ndepends entirely on features having to do with the hearer, where these\nfeatures include, e.g., the hearer\u2019s perception of the speaker\nuttering p, the hearer remembering that testimony is generally\nreliable, and the hearer inferring on these grounds that what the\nspeaker said on this occasion is likely to be true.\n\nTo see a second version of Individualism, recall the our discussion of\nTestimonial Reliabilism in\n Section 3.2.2.\n According to some (but certainly not all) Testimonial Reliabilists,\ntestimonial justification should be understood Individualistically\nbecause it consists only in the reliability of the cognitive processes\nthat are internal to the hearer, i.e., the cognitive processes that\ntake place exclusively in the mind of the hearer herself. See Alvin\nGoldman (1979, 1986) and Alston (1994, 1995).\n\nWhile we have seen a variety of problems for both of these views\nabove, it is worth considering one challenge to this individualistic\nversion of Testimonial Reliabilism in particular. Doing so will not\nonly help shed light on why some Testimonial Reliabilists opt for an\nanti-individualistic view, it will also help illustrate how the debate\nabout Individualism and Anti-Individualism cuts across the other\ndebates we have considered above.\n\nTo begin, consider these two cases from Goldberg (2010a):\n\n\nGood: Wilma has known Fred for a long time; she knows\nthat he is a highly reliable speaker. So when Fred tells her that\nBarney has been at the stonecutters\u2019 conference all day, Wilma\nbelieves him. (Fred appeared to her as sincere and competent as he\nnormally does, and she found nothing remiss with the testimony.) In\npoint of fact, Fred spoke from knowledge.\n\nBad: Wilma has known Fred for a long time; she knows\nthat he is a highly reliable speaker. So when Fred tells her that\nBarney has been at the stonecutters\u2019 conference all day, Wilma\nbelieves him. (Fred appeared to her as sincere and competent as he\nnormally does, and she found nothing remiss with the testimony.)\nHowever, in this case, Fred did not speak from knowledge. Instead, he\nwas just making up a story about Barney, having had ulterior motives\nin getting Wilma to believe this story. (Fred has never done this\nbefore; it is out of his normally reliable character to do such a\nthing.) Even so, Fred\u2019s speech contribution struck Wilma here,\nas in the good scenario, as sincere and competent; and she was not\nepistemically remiss in reaching this verdict\u2026 As luck would\nhave it, though, Barney was in fact at the conference all day (though\nFred, of course, did not know this).\n\n\nContrasting these two cases motivates the following line of thought:\nIt seems like Wilma knows that Barney was at the stonecutters\u2019\nconference (= p) in Good but not in\nBad. It also seems like the cognitive processes that\nare internal to Wilma are the same across both cases. Thus, insofar as\njustification is what turns an unGettiered, true belief into\nknowledge, and insofar as Wilma\u2019s unGettiered, true belief that\np amounts to knowledge in Good but not in\nBad, the cognitive processes involved in the\nacquisition of testimonial justification cannot just be the ones that\nare internal to Wilma. Thus, Testimonial Reliabilists should not\nendorse Individualism. See Goldberg (2010a) for this argument.\n",
