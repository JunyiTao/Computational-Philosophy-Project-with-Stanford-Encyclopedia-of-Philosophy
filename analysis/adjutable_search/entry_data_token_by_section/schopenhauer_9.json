    "main_text": "Critical Reflections\n8. Schopenhauer\u2019s Influence\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s philosophy has been widely influential, partly\nbecause his outlook acknowledges traditional moral values without the\nneed to postulate the existence of God. His view also allows for the\npossibility of absolute knowledge by means of mystical experience.\nSchopenhauer also implicitly challenges the hegemony of science and\nother literalistic modes of expression, substituting in their place,\nmore musical and literary styles of understanding. His recognition\n\u2013 at least with respect to a perspective we typically cannot\navoid \u2013 that the universe appears to be a fundamentally\nirrational place, was also appealing to 20th century\nthinkers who understood instinctual forces as irrational, and yet\nguiding, forces underlying human behavior.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s influence has been strong among literary figures,\nwhich include poets, playwrights, essayists, novelists and historians\nsuch as Charles Baudelaire, Samuel Beckett, Thomas Bernhard, Jorge\nLuis Borges, Jacob Burckhardt, Joseph Conrad, Andr\u00e9 Gide,\nGeorge Gissing, Franz Grillparzer, Thomas Hardy, Gerhardt Hauptmann,\nFriedrich Hebbel, Hugo von Hoffmansthal, Joris Karl Huysmans, Ernst\nJ\u00fcnger, Karl Kraus, D. H. Lawrence, Joaquim Maria Machado de\nAssis, Stephane Mallarm\u00e9, Thomas Mann, Guy de Maupassant,\nHerman Melville, Robert Musil, Edgar Allan Poe, Marcel Proust, Arno\nSchmidt, August Strindberg, Italo Svevo, Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Turgenev,\nFrank Wedekind, W. B. Yeats, and Emile Zola. In general, these authors\nwere inspired by Schopenhauer\u2019s sense of the world\u2019s\nabsurdity, either regarded in a more nihilistic and gloomy manner, or\nregarded in a more lighthearted, absurdist, and comic manner.\n\nAmong philosophers, one can cite Henri Bergson, Julius Bahnsen, Eduard\nvon Hartmann, Suzanne Langer, Philipp Mainl\u00e4nder, Hans Vaihinger,\nand Friedrich Nietzsche, where each tended to focus on selected\naspects of Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy, such as his views on the\nmeaning of life, his theory of the non-rational will, his theory of\nmusic, or his Kantianism. Insofar as he influenced Nietzsche, who\nsubordinated science to art, Continental philosophy\u2019s\ntwentieth-century challenge to purely literalistic styles of\nphilosophy via Nietzsche is anticipated by Schopenhauer\u2019s view\nthat music expresses metaphysical truth more directly than does\ntraditional philosophy.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s theory of music, along with his emphasis upon\nartistic genius and the world-as-suffering, was also influential among\ncomposers such as Johannes Brahms, Anton\u00edn Dvor\u00e1k,\nGustav Mahler, Hans Pfitzner, Sergei Prokofiev, Nikolay\nRimsky-Korsakoff, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, and Richard Wagner. Insofar\nas he influenced Wagner, who is the father of twentieth-century music\nwritten to accompany and enhance motion pictures, Schopenhauer\u2019s\ntheory of music as the expression of a continual flow of emotion\nstands significantly behind the contemporary experience of music in\nartistic and communicational media.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s 19th century historical profile is\nfrequently obscured by the shadows of Kant, Hegel, Marx, Mill, Darwin\nand Nietzsche, but more than is usually recognized, in his rejection\nof rationalistic conceptions of the world as early as 1818, he\nperceived the shape of things to come. The hollow, nihilistic laughter\nexpressed by the Dada movement at the turn of the century in the midst\nof WWI, reiterates feelings that Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy had\nembodied almost a century earlier. Schopenhauer\u2019s ideas about\nthe importance of instinctual urges at the core of daily life also\nreappeared in Freud\u2019s surrealism-inspiring psychoanalytic\nthought, and his conviction that human history is going nowhere,\nbecame keynotes within 20th century French philosophy,\nafter two World Wars put a damper on the 19th century\nanticipations of continual progress that had captured the hearts of\nthinkers such as Hegel and Marx.\n",
