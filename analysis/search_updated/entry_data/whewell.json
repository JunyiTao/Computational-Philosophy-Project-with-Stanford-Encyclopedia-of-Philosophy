    "preamble": "\n\nWilliam Whewell (1794\u20131866) was one of the most important and\ninfluential figures in nineteenth-century Britain. Whewell, a\npolymath, wrote extensively on numerous subjects, including mechanics,\nmineralogy, geology, astronomy, political economy, theology,\neducational reform, international law, and architecture, as well as\nthe works that remain the most well-known today in philosophy of\nscience, history of science, and moral philosophy. He was one of the\nfounding members and a president of the British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science, a fellow of the Royal Society, president of\nthe Geological Society, and longtime Master of Trinity College,\nCambridge. In his own time his influence was acknowledged by the major\nscientists of the day, such as John Herschel, Charles Darwin, Charles\nLyell and Michael Faraday, who frequently turned to Whewell for\nphilosophical and scientific advice, and, interestingly, for\nterminological assistance. Whewell invented the terms\n\u201canode,\u201d \u201ccathode,\u201d and \u201cion\u201d for\nFaraday. In response to a challenge by the poet S.T. Coleridge in\n1833, Whewell invented the English word \u201cscientist;\u201d\nbefore this time the only terms in use in that language were\n\u201cnatural philosopher\u201d and \u201cman of science\u201d.\nWhewell was greatly influenced by his association with three of his\nfellow students at Cambridge: Charles Babbage, John Herschel, and\nRichard Jones. Over the winter of 1812 and spring of 1813, the four\nmet for what they called \u201cPhilosophical Breakfasts\u201d at\nwhich they discussed induction and scientific method. For the next 50\nyears these friends remained in contact, developing their view of\ninductive reasoning and applying it in diverse realms (see Snyder\n2011).\n\nWhewell is most known today for his extensive works on the history and\nphilosophy of science. His philosophy of science was attacked by John\nStuart Mill in his System of Logic, causing an interesting\nand fruitful debate between them over the nature of inductive\nreasoning in science, moral philosophy, and political economy (for\ndiscussions of this debate, see Hutton 1850; Losee 1983; Snyder 2006;\nMillgram 2014; Menke 2018; Gaukroger 2019; Snyder 2021). It is in the\ncontext of the debate over philosophy of science that Whewell\u2019s\nphilosophy was rediscovered in the 20th century by critics of logical\npositivism. In this entry, I will focus on the most important\nphilosophical aspects of Whewell\u2019s works: his philosophy of\nscience, including his views of induction, confirmation, and necessary\ntruth; his view of the relation between scientific practice, history\nof science, and philosophy of science; and his moral philosophy. His\nview of induction is the most interesting and important part of his\nphilosophy as well as the most often misinterpreted.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biography\n\nWhewell was born in 1794, the eldest child of a master-carpenter in\nLancaster. The headmaster of his local grammar school, a parish\npriest, recognized Whewell\u2019s intellectual abilities and\npersuaded his father to allow him to attend the Heversham Grammar\nSchool in Westmorland, some twelve miles to the north, where he would\nbe able to qualify for a closed exhibition to Trinity College,\nCambridge. In the 19th century and earlier, these \u201cclosed\nexhibitions\u201d or scholarships were set aside for the children of\nworking class parents, to allow for some social mobility. Whewell\nstudied at Heversham Grammar for two years, and received private\ncoaching in mathematics. Although he did win the exhibition it did not\nprovide full resources for a boy of his family\u2019s means to attend\nCambridge; so money had to be raised in a public subscription to\nsupplement the scholarship money.\n\nHe thus came up to Trinity in 1812 as a \u201csub-sizar\u201d\n(scholarship student). In 1814 he won the Chancellor\u2019s prize for\nhis epic poem \u201cBoadicea,\u201d in this way following in the\nfootsteps of his mother, Elizabeth Whewell, who had published poems in\nthe local papers. Yet he did not neglect the mathematical side of his\ntraining; in 1816 he proved his mathematical prowess by placing as\nboth second Wrangler and second Smith\u2019s Prize man. The following\nyear he won a college fellowship. He was elected to the Royal Society\nin 1820, and ordained a priest (as required for Trinity Fellows) in\n1825. He took up the Chair in Mineralogy in 1828, and resigned it in\n1832. In 1838 Whewell became Professor of Moral Philosophy. Almost\nimmediately after his marriage to Cordelia Marshall on 12 October\n1841, he was named Master of Trinity College upon the recommendation\nof the Prime Minister Robert Peel. He was Vice-Chancellor of the\nUniversity in 1842 and again in 1855. In 1848 he played a large role\nin establishing the Natural and Moral Sciences Triposes at the\nUniversity. His first wife died in 1855, and he later married Lady\nEvalina Affleck, the widowed sister of his friend Robert Ellis. Lady\nAffleck died in 1865. Whewell had no children. He died, after being\nthrown from his horse, on 6 March 1866. (More details about\nWhewell\u2019s life and times can be found in Snyder 2011.)\n2. Philosophy of Science: Induction\n\nAccording to Whewell, all knowledge has both an ideal, or subjective\ndimension, as well as an objective dimension. He called this the\n\u201cfundamental antithesis\u201d of knowledge. Whewell explained\nthat \u201cin every act of knowledge \u2026 there are two opposite\nelements, which we may call Ideas and Perceptions\u201d (1860a, 307).\nHe criticized Kant and the German Idealists for their exclusive focus\non the ideal or subjective element, and Locke and the\n\u201cSensationalist School\u201d for their exclusive focus on the\nempirical, objective element. Like Francis Bacon, Whewell claimed to\nbe seeking a \u201cmiddle way\u201d between pure rationalism and\nultra-empiricism. Whewell believed that gaining knowledge requires\nattention to both ideal and empirical elements, to ideas as well as\nsensations. These ideas, which he called \u201cFundamental\nIdeas,\u201d are \u201csupplied by the mind itself\u201d\u2014they\nare not (as Mill and Herschel protested) merely received from our\nobservations of the world. Whewell explained that the Fundamental\nIdeas are \u201cnot a consequence of experience, but a result of the\nparticular constitution and activity of the mind, which is independent\nof all experience in its origin, though constantly combined with\nexperience in its exercise\u201d (1858a, I, 91). Consequently, the\nmind is an active participant in our attempts to gain knowledge of the\nworld, not merely a passive recipient of sense data. Ideas such as\nSpace, Time, Cause, and Resemblance provide a structure or form for\nthe multitude of sensations we experience. The Ideas provide a\nstructure by expressing the general relations that exist between our\nsensations (1847, I, 25). Thus, the Idea of Space allows us to\napprehend objects as having form, magnitude, and position. Whewell\nheld, then, that observation is \u201cidea-laden;\u201d all\nobservation, he noted, involves \u201cunconscious inference\u201d\nusing the Fundamental Ideas (see 1858a, I, 46). Each science has a\nParticular Fundamental idea which is needed to organize the facts with\nwhich that science is concerned; thus, Space is the Fundamental Idea\nof geometry, Cause the Fundamental Idea of mechanics, and Substance\nthe Fundamental Idea of chemistry. Moreover, Whewell explained that\neach Fundamental Idea has certain \u201cconceptions\u201d included\nwithin it; these conceptions are \u201cspecial modifications\u201d\nof the Idea applied to particular types of circumstances (1858b, 187).\nFor example, the conception of force is a modification of the Idea of\nCause, applied to the particular case of motion (see 1858a, I,\n184\u20135 and 236).\n\nThus far, this discussion of the Fundamental Ideas may suggest that\nthey are similar to Kant\u2019s forms of intuition, and indeed there\nare some similarities. Because of this, some commentators have argued\nthat Whewell\u2019s epistemology is a type of Kantianism (see, for\nexample, Butts 1973; Buchdahl 1991). However, this interpretation\nignores several crucial differences between the two views. Whewell did\nnot follow Kant in drawing a distinction between\n\u201cprecepts,\u201d or forms of intuition, such as Space and Time,\nand the categories, or forms of thought, in which Kant included the\nconcepts of Cause and Substance. Moreover, Whewell included as\nFundamental Ideas many ideas which function not as conditions of\nexperience but as conditions for having knowledge within their\nrespective sciences: although it is certainly possible to have\nexperience of the world without having a distinct idea of, say,\nChemical Affinity, we could not have any knowledge of certain chemical\nprocesses without it. Unlike Kant, Whewell did not attempt to give an\nexhaustive list of these Fundamental Ideas; indeed, he believed that\nthere are others which will emerge in the course of the development of\nscience. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly for his philosophy of\nscience, Whewell rejected Kant\u2019s claim that we can only have\nknowledge of our \u201ccategorized experience.\u201d The Fundamental\nIdeas, on Whewell\u2019s view, accurately represent objective\nfeatures of the world, independent of the processes of the mind, and\nwe can use these Ideas in order to have knowledge of these objective\nfeatures. Indeed, Whewell criticized Kant for viewing external reality\nas a \u201cdim and unknown region\u201d (see 1860a, 312). Further,\nWhewell\u2019s justification for the presence of these concepts in\nour minds takes a very different form than Kant\u2019s transcendental\nargument. For Kant, the categories are justified because they make\nexperience possible. For Whewell, though the categories do\nmake experience (of certain kinds) possible, the Ideas are justified\nby their origin in the mind of a divine creator (see especially his\ndiscussion of this in his 1860a). And finally, the type of necessity\nwhich Whewell claimed is derived from the Ideas is very different from\nKant\u2019s notion of the synthetic a priori (For a nuanced\nview of the relation between the views of Kant and Whewell, see\nDucheyne 2011.) I return to these last two points in the section on\nNecessary Truth below.\n\nI turn now to a discussion of the theory of induction Whewell\ndeveloped with his antithetical epistemology. From his earliest\nthoughts about scientific method, Whewell was interested in developing\nan inductive theory. At their philosophical breakfasts at Cambridge,\nWhewell, Babbage, Herschel and Jones discussed how science had\nstagnated since the heady days of the Scientific Revolution in the\n17th century. It was time for a new revolution, which they pledged to\nbring about. The cornerstone of this new revolution was to be the\npromotion of a Baconian-type of induction, and all four men began\ntheir careers endorsing an inductive scientific method against the\ndeductive method then being advanced by political economist David\nRicardo, logician Richard Whately, and their followers (see Snyder\n2011). (Although the four friends agreed about the importance of an\ninductive scientific method, Herschel and Jones would late take issue\nwith some aspects of Whewell\u2019s version, notably his antithetical\nepistemology.)\n\nWhewell\u2019s first explicit, lengthy discussion of induction is\nfound in his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, founded upon\ntheir History, which was originally published in 1840 (a second,\nenlarged edition appeared in 1847, and the third edition appeared as\nthree separate works published between 1858 and 1860). He called his\ninduction \u201cDiscoverers\u2019 Induction\u201d and explained\nthat it is used to discover both phenomenal and causal laws. Whewell\nconsidered himself to be a follower of Bacon, and claimed to be\n\u201crenovating\u201d Bacon\u2019s inductive method; thus one\nvolume of the third edition of the Philosophy is entitled\nNovum Organon Renovatum. Whewell followed Bacon in rejecting\nthe standard, overly-narrow notion of induction that holds induction\nto be merely simple enumeration of instances. Rather, Whewell\nexplained that, in induction, \u201cthere is a New Element added to\nthe combination [of instances] by the very act of thought by which\nthey were combined\u201d (1847, II, 48). This \u201cact of\nthought\u201d is a process Whewell called \u201ccolligation.\u201d\nColligation, according to Whewell, is the mental operation of bringing\ntogether a number of empirical facts by \u201csuperinducing\u201d\nupon them a conception which unites the facts and renders them capable\nof being expressed by a general law. The conception thus provides the\n\u201ctrue bond of Unity by which the phenomena are held\ntogether\u201d (1847, II, 46), by providing a property shared by the\nknown members of a class (in the case of causal laws, the colligating\nproperty is that of sharing the same cause).\n\nThus the known points of the Martian orbit were colligated by Kepler\nusing the conception of an elliptical curve. Often new discoveries are\nmade, Whewell pointed out, not when new facts are discovered but when\nthe appropriate conception is applied to the facts. In the case of\nKepler\u2019s discovery, the observed points of the orbit were known\nto Tycho Brahe, but only when Kepler applied the ellipse conception\nwas the true path of the orbit discovered. Kepler was the first one to\napply this conception to an orbital path in part because he had, in\nhis mind, a very clear notion of the conception of an ellipse. This is\nimportant because the fundamental ideas and conceptions are provided\nby our minds, but they cannot be used in their innate form. Whewell\nexplained that \u201cthe Ideas, the germs of them at least, were in\nthe human mind before [experience]; but by the progress of scientific\nthought they are unfolded into clearness and distinctness\u201d\n(1860a, 373). Whewell referred to this \u201cunfolding\u201d of\nideas and conceptions as the \u201cexplication of conceptions.\u201d\nExplication is a necessary precondition to discovery, and it consists\nin a partly empirical, partly rational process. Scientists first try\nto clarify and make explicit a conception in their minds, then attempt\nto apply it to the facts they have precisely examined, to determine\nwhether the conception can colligate the facts into a law. If not, the\nscientist uses this experience to attempt a further refinement of the\nconception. Whewell claimed that a large part of the history of\nscience is the \u201chistory of scientific ideas,\u201d that is, the\nhistory of their explication and subsequent use as colligating\nconcepts. Thus, in the case of Kepler\u2019s use of the ellipse\nconception, Whewell noted that \u201cto supply this conception,\nrequired a special preparation, and a special activity in the mind of\nthe discoverer. \u2026 To discover such a connection, the mind must\nbe conversant with certain relations of space, and with certain kinds\nof figures\u201d (1849, 28\u20139).\n\nOnce conceptions have been explicated, it is possible to choose the\nappropriate conception with which to colligate phenomena. But how is\nthe appropriate conception chosen? According to Whewell, it is not a\nmatter of guesswork. Nor, importantly, is it merely a matter of\nobservation. Whewell explained that \u201cthere is a special process\nin the mind, in addition to the mere observation of facts, which is\nnecessary\u201d (1849, 40). This \u201cspecial process in the\nmind\u201d is a process of inference. \u201cWe infer more than we\nsee,\u201d Whewell claimed (1858a, I, 46). Typically, finding the\nappropriate conception with which to colligate a class of phenomena\nrequires a series of inferences, thus Whewell noted that\ndiscoverers\u2019s induction is a process involving a \u201ctrain of\nresearches\u201d (1857/1873, I, 297). He allowed any type of\ninference in the colligation, including enumerative, eliminative and\nanalogical. Thus Kepler in his Astronomia Nova (1609) can be\nseen as using various forms of inference to reach the ellipse\nconception (see Snyder 1997a). When Augustus DeMorgan complained, in\nhis 1847 logic text, about certain writers using the term\n\u201cinduction\u201d as including \u201cthe use of the whole box\nof [logical] tools,\u201d he was undoubtedly referring to his teacher\nand friend Whewell (see Snyder 2008).\n\nAfter the known members of a class are colligated with the use of a\nconception, the second step of Whewell\u2019s discoverers\u2019\ninduction occurs: namely, the generalization of the shared property\nover the complete class, including its unknown members. Often, as\nWhewell admitted, this is a trivially simple procedure. Once Kepler\nsupplied the conception of an ellipse to the observed members of the\nclass of Mars\u2019 positions, he generalized it to all members of\nthe class, including those which were unknown (unobserved), to reach\nthe conclusion that \u201call the points of Mars\u2019 orbit lie on\nan ellipse with the sun at one focus.\u201d He then performed a\nfurther generalization to reach his first law of planetary motion:\n\u201cthe orbits of all the planets lie on ellipses with the sun at\none focus.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned that Whewell thought of himself as renovating\nBacon\u2019s inductive philosophy. His inductivism does share\nnumerous features with Bacon\u2019s method of interpreting nature:\nfor instance the claims that induction must involve more than merely\nsimple enumeration of instances, that science must proceed by\nsuccessive steps of generalization, that inductive science can reach\nunobservables (for Bacon, the \u201cforms,\u201d for Whewell,\nunobservable entities such as light waves or properties such as\nelliptical orbits or gravitational forces). (For more on the relation\nbetween Whewell and Bacon see Snyder 2006; McCaskey 2014.) Yet,\nsurprisingly, the received view of Whewell\u2019s methodology in the\n20th century tended to describe Whewell as an anti-inductivist in the\nPopperian mold. (see, for example, Ruse 1975; Niiniluoto 1977; Laudan\n1980; Butts 1987; Buchdahl 1991). That is, it was claimed that Whewell\nendorsed a \u201cconjectures and refutations\u201d view of\nscientific discovery. However, it is clear from the above discussion\nthat his view of discoverers\u2019 induction does not resemble the\nview asserting that hypotheses can be and are typically arrived at by\nmere guesswork. Indeed, Whewell explicitly rejected the\nhypothetico-deductive claim that hypotheses discovered by non-rational\nguesswork can be confirmed by consequentialist testing. For example,\nin his review of his friend Herschel\u2019s Preliminary Discourse\non the Study of Natural Philosophy, Whewell argued, against\nHerschel, that verification is not possible when a hypothesis has been\nformed non-inductively (1831, 400\u20131). Nearly thirty years later,\nin the last edition of the Philosophy, Whewell referred to\nthe belief that \u201cthe discovery of laws and causes of phenomena\nis a loose hap-hazard sort of guessing,\u201d and claimed that this\ntype of view \u201cappears to me to be a misapprehension of the whole\nnature of science\u201d (1860a, 274). In other mature works he noted\nthat discoveries are made \u201cnot by any capricious conjecture of\narbitrary selection\u201d (1858a, I, 29) and explained that new\nhypotheses are properly \u201ccollected from the facts\u201d (1849,\n17). In fact, Whewell was criticized by his contemporary David\nBrewster for not agreeing that discoveries, including\nNewton\u2019s discovery of the universal gravitation law, were\ntypically made by accident.\n\nWhy has Whewell been misinterpreted by so many modern commentators?\nOne reason has to do with the error of reading certain terms used by\nWhewell in the 19th century as if they held the same meaning they have\nin the 20th and 21st. Thus, since Whewell used the terms\n\u201cconjectures\u201d and \u201cguesses,\u201d some writers\nbelieve that he shares Popper\u2019s methodology. Whewell made\nmention, for instance, of the \u201chappy guesses\u201d made by\nscientists (1858b, 64) and claimed that \u201cadvances in\nknowledge\u201d often follow \u201cthe previous exercise of some\nboldness and license in guessing\u201d (1847, II, 55). But Whewell\ngenerally used these terms to connote a conclusion that is not (yet)\nconclusively confirmed. The Oxford English Dictionary tells\nus that prior to the 20th century the term \u201cconjecture\u201d\nwas used to connote not a hypothesis reached by non-rational means,\nbut rather one which is \u201cunverified,\u201d or which is \u201ca\nconclusion as to what is likely or probable\u201d (as opposed to the\nresults of demonstration). The term was used this way by Bacon,\nKepler, Newton, and Dugald Stewart, writers whose work was well-known\nto Whewell. In other places where Whewell used the term\n\u201cconjecture\u201d he suggests that what appears to be the\nresult of guesswork is actually what we might call an \u201ceducated\nguess,\u201d i.e., a conclusion drawn by (weak) inference. Whewell\ndescribed Kepler\u2019s discovery, which seems so \u201ccapricious\nand fanciful\u201d as actually being \u201cregulated\u201d by his\n\u201cclear scientific ideas\u201d (1857/1873, I, 291\u20132).\nFinally, Whewell\u2019s use of the terminology of guessing sometimes\noccurs in the context of a distinction he draws between the generation\nof a number of possible conceptions, and the selection of one to\nsuperinduce upon the facts. Before the appropriate conception is\nfound, the scientist must be able to call up in his mind a number of\npossible ones (see 1858b, 79). Whewell noted that this calling up of\nmany possibilities \u201cis, in some measure, a process of\nconjecture.\u201d However, selecting the appropriate conception with\nwhich to colligate the data is not conjectural (1858b, 78). Thus\nWhewell claimed that the selection of the conception is often\n\u201cpreluded by guesses\u201d (1858b, xix); he does not,\nthat is, claim that the selection consists in guesswork. When\ninference is not used to select the appropriate conception, the\nresulting theory is not an \u201cinduction,\u201d but rather a\n\u201chasty and imperfect hypothesis.\u201d He drew such a\ndistinction between Copernicus\u2019 heliocentric theory, which he\ncalled an induction, and the heliocentric system proposed by\nAristarchus in the third century BCE to which he referred as a hasty\nand imperfect hypothesis (1857/1873, I, 258).\n\nThus Whewell\u2019s philosophy of science cannot be described as the\nhypothetico-deductive view. It is an inductive method; yet it clearly\ndiffers from the more narrow inductivism of Mill. Whewell\u2019s view\nof induction has the advantage over Mill\u2019s of allowing the\ninference to unobservable properties and entities, and for this reason\nis a more accurate view of how science works. (For more detailed\narguments against reading Whewell as a hypothetico-deductivist, see\nSnyder 2006; Snyder 2008; McCaskey 2014).\n3. Philosophy of Science: Confirmation\n\nOn Whewell\u2019s view, once a theory is invented by\ndiscoverers\u2019 induction, it must pass a variety of tests before\nit can be considered confirmed as an empirical truth. These tests are\nprediction, consilience, and coherence (see 1858b, 83\u201396). These\nare characterized by Whewell as, first, that \u201cour hypotheses\nought to fortel [sic] phenomena which have not yet been\nobserved\u201d (1858b, 86); second, that they should \u201cexplain\nand determine cases of a kind different from those which were\ncontemplated in the formation\u201d of those hypotheses (1858b, 88);\nand third that hypotheses must \u201cbecome more coherent\u201d over\ntime (1858b, 91).\n\nI start by discussing the criterion of prediction. Hypotheses ought to\nforetell phenomena, \u201cat least all phenomena of the same\nkind,\u201d Whewell explained, because \u201cour assent to the\nhypothesis implies that it is held to be true of all particular\ninstances. That these cases belong to past or to future times, that\nthey have or have not already occurred, makes no difference in the\napplicability of the rule to them. Because the rule prevails, it\nincludes all cases\u201d (1858b, 86). Whewell\u2019s point here is\nsimply that since our hypotheses are in universal form, a true\nhypothesis will cover all particular instances of the rule, including\npast, present, and future cases. But he also makes the stronger claim\nthat successful predictions of unknown facts provide greater\nconfirmatory value than explanations of already-known facts. Thus he\nheld the historical claim that \u201cnew evidence\u201d is more\nvaluable than \u201cold evidence.\u201d He believed that \u201cto\npredict unknown facts found afterwards to be true is \u2026 a\nconfirmation of a theory which in impressiveness and value goes beyond\nany explanation of known facts\u201d (1857/1873, II, 557). Whewell\nclaimed that the agreement of the prediction with what occurs (i.e.,\nthe fact that the prediction turns out to be correct), is\n\u201cnothing strange, if the theory be true, but quite\nunaccountable, if it be not\u201d (1860a, 273\u20134). For example,\nif Newtonian theory were not true, he argued, the fact that from the\ntheory we could correctly predict the existence, location and mass of\na new planet, Neptune (as did happen in 1846), would be bewildering,\nand indeed miraculous.\n\nAn even more valuable confirmation criterion, according to Whewell, is\nthat of \u201cconsilience.\u201d Whewell explained that \u201cthe\nevidence in favour of our induction is of a much higher and more\nforcible character when it enables us to explain and determine [i.e.,\npredict] cases of a kind different from those which were\ncontemplated in the formation of our hypothesis. The instances in\nwhich this have occurred, indeed, impress us with a conviction that\nthe truth of our hypothesis is certain\u201d (1858b, 87\u20138).\nWhewell called this type of evidence a \u201cjumping together\u201d\nor \u201cconsilience\u201d of inductions. An induction, which\nresults from the colligation of one class of facts, is found also to\ncolligate successfully facts belonging to another class.\nWhewell\u2019s notion of consilience is thus related to his view of\nnatural classes of objects or events.\n\nTo understand this confirmation criterion, it may be helpful to\nschematize the \u201cjumping together\u201d that occurred in the\ncase of Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation, Whewell\u2019s\nexemplary case of consilience. On Whewell\u2019s view, Newton used\nthe form of inference Whewell characterized as\n\u201cdiscoverers\u2019 induction\u201d in order to reach his\nuniversal gravitation law, the inverse-square law of attraction. Part\nof this process is portrayed in book III of the Principia,\nwhere Newton listed a number of \u201cpropositions.\u201d These\npropositions are empirical laws that are inferred from certain\n\u201cphenomena\u201d (which are described in the preceding section\nof book III). The first such proposition or law is that \u201cthe\nforces by which the circumjovial planets are continually drawn off\nfrom rectilinear motions, and retained in their proper orbits, tend to\nJupiter\u2019s centre; and are inversely as the squares of the\ndistances of the places of those planets from that centre.\u201d The\nresult of another, separate induction from the phenomena of\n\u201cplanetary motion\u201d is that \u201cthe forces by which the\nprimary planets are continually drawn off from rectilinear motions,\nand retained in their proper orbits, tend to the sun; and are\ninversely as the squares of the distances of the places of those\nplanets from the sun\u2019s centre.\u201d Newton saw that these\nlaws, as well as other results of a number of different inductions,\ncoincided in postulating the existence of an inverse-square attractive\nforce as the cause of various classes of phenomena. According to\nWhewell, Newton saw that these inductions \u201cleap to the same\npoint;\u201d i.e., to the same law. Newton was then able to bring\ntogether inductively (or \u201ccolligate\u201d) these laws, and\nfacts of other kinds of events (e.g., the class of events known as\n\u201cfalling bodies\u201d), into a new, more general law, namely\nthe universal gravitation law: \u201cAll bodies attract each other\nwith a force of gravity which is inverse as the squares of the\ndistances.\u201d By seeing that an inverse-square attractive force\nprovided a cause for different classes of events\u2014for satellite\nmotion, planetary motion, and falling bodies\u2014Newton was able to\nperform a more general induction, to his universal law.\n\nWhat Newton found was that these different kinds of\nphenomena\u2014including circumjovial orbits, planetary orbits, as\nwell as falling bodies\u2014share an essential property, namely the\nsame cause. What Newton did, in effect, was to subsume these\nindividual \u201cevent kinds\u201d into a more general natural kind\ncomprised of sub-kinds sharing a kind essence, namely being caused by\nan inverse-square attractive force. Consilience of event kinds\ntherefore results in causal unification. More specifically,\nit results in unification of natural kind categories based on a shared\ncause. Phenomena that constitute different event kinds, such as\n\u201cplanetary motion,\u201d \u201ctidal activity,\u201d and\n\u201cfalling bodies,\u201d were found by Newton to be members of a\nunified, more general kind, \u201cphenomena caused to occur by an\ninverse-square attractive force of gravity\u201d (or,\n\u201cgravitational phenomena\u201d). In such cases, according to\nWhewell, we learn that we have found a \u201cvera causa,\u201d or a\n\u201ctrue cause,\u201d i.e., a cause that really exists in nature,\nand whose effects are members of the same natural kind (see 1860a, p.\n191). Moreover, by finding a cause shared by phenomena in different\nsub-kinds, we are able to colligate all the facts about these kinds\ninto a more general causal law. Whewell claimed that \u201cwhen the\ntheory, by the concurrences of two indications \u2026 has included a\nnew range of phenomena, we have, in fact, a new induction of a more\ngeneral kind, to which the inductions formerly obtained are\nsubordinate, as particular cases to a general population\u201d\n(1858b, 96). He noted that consilience is the means by which we effect\nthe successive generalization that constitutes the advancement of\nscience (1847, II, 74). (For early discussions of consilience see\nLaudan 1971 and, especially, Hesse 1968 and Hesse 1971; for more on\nconsilience and its relation to realism and natural kinds, see Snyder\n2005 and Snyder 2006. On consilience and classification, see Quinn,\n2017. For more on Whewell and scientific kinds, see Cowles 2016.)\n\nWhewell discussed a further, related test of a theory\u2019s truth:\nnamely, \u201ccoherence.\u201d In the case of true theories, Whewell\nclaimed, \u201cthe system becomes more coherent as it is further\nextended. The elements which we require for explaining a new class of\nfacts are already contained in our system\u2026.In false theories,\nthe contrary is the case\u201d (1858b, 91). Coherence occurs when we\nare able to extend our hypothesis to colligate a new class of\nphenomena without ad hoc modification of the hypothesis. When Newton\nextended his theory regarding an inverse-square attractive force,\nwhich colligated facts of planetary motion and lunar motion, to the\nclass of \u201ctidal activity,\u201d he did not need to add any new\nsuppositions to the theory in order to colligate correctly the facts\nabout particular tides. On the other hand, Whewell explained, when\nphlogiston theory, which colligated facts about the class of phenomena\n\u201cchemical combination,\u201d was extended to colligate the\nclass of phenomena \u201cweight of bodies,\u201d it was\nunable to do so without an ad hoc and implausible\nmodification (namely, the assumption that phlogiston has\n\u201cnegative weight\u201d) (see 1858b, 92\u20133). Thus coherence\ncan be seen as a type of consilience that happens over time; indeed,\nWhewell remarked that these two criteria\u2014consilience and\ncoherence\u2014\u201care, in fact, hardly different\u201d (1858b,\n95).\n4. Philosophy of Science: Necessary Truth\n\nA particularly intriguing aspect of Whewell\u2019s philosophy of\nscience is his claim that empirical science can reach necessary\ntruths. Explaining this apparently contradictory claim was considered\nby Whewell to be the \u201cultimate problem\u201d of philosophy (see\nthe important paper by Morrison 1997). Whewell accounted for it by\nreference to his antithetical epistemology. Necessary truths are\ntruths which can be known a priori; they can be known in this\nway because they are necessary consequences of ideas which are a\npriori. They are necessary consequences in the sense of being\nanalytic consequences. Whewell explicitly rejected Kant\u2019s claim\nthat necessary truths are synthetic. Using the example \u201c7 + 8 =\n15,\u201d Whewell claimed that \u201cwe refer to our conceptions of\nseven, of eight, and of addition, and as soon as we possess the\nconceptions distinctly, we see that the sum must be 15.\u201d That\nis, merely by knowing the meanings of \u201cseven,\u201d\nand \u201ceight,\u201d and \u201caddition,\u201d we see that it\nfollows necessarily that \u201c7 + 8 = 15\u201d (1848, 471).\n\nOnce the Ideas and conceptions are explicated, so that we understand\ntheir meanings, the necessary truths which follow from them are seen\nas being necessarily true. Thus, once the Idea of Space is explicated,\nit is seen to be necessarily true that \u201ctwo straight lines\ncannot enclose a space.\u201d Whewell suggested that the first law of\nmotion is also a necessary truth, which was knowable a priori\nonce the Idea of Cause and the associated conception of force were\nexplicated. This is why empirical science is needed to see necessary\ntruths: because, as we saw above, empirical science is needed in order\nto explicate the Ideas. Thus Whewell also claimed that, in the course\nof science, truths which at first required experiment to be known are\nseen to be capable of being known independently of experiment. That\nis, once the relevant Idea is clarified, the necessary connection\nbetween the Idea and an empirical truth becomes apparent. Whewell\nexplained that \u201cthough the discovery of the First Law of Motion\nwas made, historically speaking, by means of experiment, we have now\nattained a point of view in which we see that it might have been\ncertainly known to be true independently of experience\u201d (1847,\nI, 221). Science, then, consists in the \u201cidealization of\nfacts,\u201d the transferring of truths from the empirical to the\nideal side of the fundamental antithesis. He described this process as\nthe \u201cprogressive intuition of necessary truths.\u201d\n\nAlthough they follow analytically from the meanings of ideas our minds\nsupply, necessary truths are nevertheless informative statements about\nthe physical world outside us; they have empirical content.\nWhewell\u2019s justification for this claim is a theological one.\nWhewell noted that God created the universe in accordance with certain\n\u201cDivine Ideas.\u201d That is, all objects and events in the\nworld were created by God to conform to certain of his ideas. For\nexample, God made the world such that it corresponds to the idea of\nCause partially expressed by the axiom \u201cevery event has a\ncause.\u201d Hence in the universe every event conforms to this idea,\nnot only by having a cause but by being such that it could not occur\nwithout a cause. On Whewell\u2019s view, we are able to have\nknowledge of the world because the Fundamental Ideas which are used to\norganize our sciences resemble the ideas used by God in his creation\nof the physical world. The fact that this is so is no coincidence: God\nhas created our minds such that they contain these same ideas. That\nis, God has given us our ideas (or, rather, the \u201cgerms\u201d of\nthe ideas) so that \u201cthey can and must agree with the\nworld\u201d (1860a, 359). God intends that we can have knowledge of\nthe physical world, and this is possible only through the use of ideas\nwhich resemble those that were used in creating the world. Hence with\nour ideas\u2014once they are properly \u201cunfolded\u201d and\nexplicated\u2014we can colligate correctly the facts of the world and\nform true theories. And when these ideas are distinct, we can know\na priori the axioms which express their meaning.\n\nAn interesting consequence of this interpretation of Whewell\u2019s\nview of necessity is that every law of nature is a necessary truth, in\nvirtue of following analytically from some idea used by God in\ncreating the world. Whewell drew no distinction between truths which\ncan be idealized and those which cannot; thus, potentially, any\nempirical truth can be seen to be a necessary truth, once the ideas\nand conceptions are explicated sufficiently. For example, Whewell\nsuggests that experiential truths such as \u201csalt is\nsoluble\u201d may be necessary truths, even if we do not recognize\nthis necessity (i.e., even if it is not yet knowable a\npriori) (1860b, 483). Whewell\u2019s view thus destroys the line\ntraditionally drawn between laws of nature and the axiomatic\npropositions of the pure sciences of mathematics; mathematical truth\nis granted no special status.\n\nIn this way Whewell suggested a view of scientific understanding which\nis, perhaps not surprisingly, grounded in his conception of natural\ntheology. Since our ideas are \u201cshadows\u201d of the Divine\nIdeas, to see a law as a necessary consequence of our ideas is to see\nit as a consequence of the Divine Ideas exemplified in the world.\nUnderstanding involves seeing a law as being not an arbitrary\n\u201caccident on the cosmic scale,\u201d but as a necessary\nconsequence of the ideas God used in creating the universe. Hence the\nmore we idealize the facts, the more difficult it will be to deny\nGod\u2019s existence. We will come to see more and more truths as the\nintelligible result of intentional design. This view is related to the\nclaim Whewell had earlier made in his Bridgewater Treatise (1833),\nthat the more we study the laws of nature the more convinced we will\nbe in the existence of a Divine Law-giver. (For more on\nWhewell\u2019s notion of necessity, see Fisch 1985; Snyder 1994;\nMorrison 1997; Snyder 2006; Ducheyne 2009.)\n5. The Relation Between Scientific Practice, History of Science, and Philosophy of Science\n\nAn issue of interest to philosophers of science today is the relation\nbetween knowledge of the actual practice and history of science and\ndeveloping a philosophy of science. Whewell is interesting to examine\nin relation to this issue because he claimed to be inferring his\nphilosophy of science from his study of the history and practice of\nscience. His large-scale History of the Inductive Sciences\n(first edition published 1837) was a survey of science from ancient to\nmodern times. He insisted upon completing this work before writing his\nPhilosophy of the Inductive Sciences, founded upon their\nhistory. Moreover, Whewell sent proof-sheets of the\nHistory to his many scientist-friends to ensure the accuracy\nof his accounts. Besides knowing about the history of science, Whewell\nhad first-hand knowledge of scientific practice: he was actively\ninvolved in science in several important ways. In 1825 he traveled to\nBerlin and Vienna to study mineralogy and crystallography with Mohs\nand other acknowledged masters of the field. He published numerous\npapers in the field, as well as a monograph, and is still credited\nwith making important contributions to giving a mathematical\nfoundation to crystallography. He also made contributions to the\nscience of tidal research, pushing for a large-scale world-wide\nproject of tidal observations; he won a Royal Society gold medal for\nthis accomplishment. (For more on Whewell\u2019s contributions to\nscience, see Becher 1986; Ruse 1991; Ducheyne 2010a; Snyder 2011;\nHonenberger 2018). Whewell acted as a terminological consultant for\nFaraday and other scientists, who wrote to him asking for new words.\nWhewell only provided terminology when he believed he was fully\nknowledgeable about the science involved. In his section on the\n\u201cLanguage of Science\u201d in the Philosophy, Whewell\nmakes this position clear (see 1858b, p. 293). Another interesting\naspect of his intercourse with scientists becomes clear in reading his\ncorrespondence with them: namely, that Whewell constantly pushed\nFaraday, Forbes, Lubbock and others to perform certain experiments,\nmake specific observations, and to try to connect their findings in\nways of interest to Whewell. In all these ways, Whewell indicated that\nhe had a deep understanding of the activity of science.\n\nSo how is this knowledge of science and its history important for his\nwork on the philosophy of science? Some commentators have claimed that\nWhewell developed an a priori philosophy of science and then\nshaped his History to conform to his own view (Stoll 1929;\nStrong 1955). It is true that he started out, from his undergraduate\ndays, with the project of reforming the inductive philosophy of Bacon;\nindeed this early inductivism led him to the view that learning about\nscientific method must be inductive (i.e., that it requires the study\nof the history of science). Yet it is clear that he believed his study\nof the history of science and his own work in science were needed in\norder to flesh out the details of his inductive position. Thus, as in\nhis epistemology, both a priori and empirical elements\ncombined in the development of his scientific methodology. Ultimately,\nWhewell criticized Mill\u2019s view of induction developed in the\nSystem of Logic not because Mill had not inferred it from a\nstudy of the history of science, but rather on the grounds that Mill\nhad not been able to find a large number of appropriate examples\nillustrating the use of his \u201cMethods of Experimental\nInquiry.\u201d As Whewell noted, Bacon too had been unable to show\nthat his inductive method had been exemplified throughout the history\nof science. Thus it appears that what was important to Whewell was not\nwhether a philosophy of science had been, in fact, inferred from a\nstudy of the history of science, but rather, whether a philosophy of\nscience was inferable from it. That is, regardless of how a\nphilosopher came to invent her theory, she must be able to show it to\nbe exemplified in the actual scientific practice used throughout\nhistory. Whewell believed that he was able to do this for his\ndiscoverers\u2019 induction.\n6. Moral Philosophy\n\nWhewell\u2019s moral philosophy was criticized by Mill as being\n\u201cintuitionist\u201d (see Mill 1852). Whewell\u2019s moral\nphilosophy is intuitionist in the sense of claiming that\nhumans possess a faculty (\u201cconscience\u201d) which enables them\nto discern directly what is morally right or wrong. Yet his view\ndiffers from that of earlier philosophers such as Shaftesbury and\nHutcheson, who claimed that this faculty is akin to our sense organs\nand thus spoke of conscience as a \u201cmoral sense.\u201d\nWhewell\u2019s position is more similar to that of intuitionists such\nas Cudworth and Clarke, who claimed that our moral faculty is reason.\nWhewell maintained that there is no separate moral faculty,\nbut rather that conscience is just \u201creason exercised on moral\nsubjects.\u201d Because of this, Whewell referred to moral rules as\n\u201cprinciples of reason\u201d and described the discovery of\nthese rules as an activity of reason (see 1864, 23\u20134). These\nmoral rules \u201care primary principles, and are established in our\nminds simply by a contemplation of our moral nature and condition; or,\nwhat expresses the same thing, by intuition\u201d (1846, 11). Yet,\nwhat he meant by \u201cintuition\u201d was not a non-rational mental\nprocess, as Mill claimed. On Whewell\u2019s view, the contemplation\nof the moral principles is conceived as a rational process. Whewell\nnoted that \u201cCertain moral principles being, as we\u2019ve said,\nthus seen to be true by intuition, under due conditions of reflection\nand thought, are unfolded into their application by further reflection\nand thought\u201d(1864, 12\u201313). Morality requires rules because\nreason is our distinctive property, and \u201cReason directs us to\nRules\u201d (1864, 45). Whewell\u2019s morality, then, does not have\none problem associated with the moral sense intuitionists. For the\nmoral sense intuitionist, the process of decision-making is\nnon-rational; just as we feel the rain on our skin by a non-rational\nprocess, we just feel what the right action is. This is often\nconsidered the major difficulty with the intuitionist view: if the\ndecision is merely a matter of intuition, it seems that there can be\nno way to settle disputes over how we ought to act. However, Whewell\nnever suggested that decision-making in morality is a non-rational\nprocess. On the contrary, he believed that reason leads to common\ndecisions about the right way to act (although our desires/affections\nmay get in the way): he explained \u201cSo far as men decide\nconformably to Reason, they decide alike\u201d (see 1864, 43). Thus\nthe decision on how we ought to act should be made by reason, and so\nmoral disputes can be settled rationally on Whewell\u2019s view.\n\nMill also criticized Whewell\u2019s claim that moral rules are\nnecessary truths which are self-evident. Mill took this to mean that\nthere can be no progress in morality\u2014what is self-evident must\nalways remain so\u2014and thus to the further conclusion that Whewell\nbelieved the current rules of society to be necessary truths. Such a\nview would tend to support the status quo, as Mill rightly complained.\n(Thus he, rather unfairly. accused Whewell of justifying evil\npractices such as cruelty to animals, forced marriages, and even\nslavery.) But Mill was wrong to attribute such a view to Whewell.\nWhewell did claim that moral rules are necessary truths, and invested\nthem with the epistemological status of self-evident\n\u201caxioms\u201d (see 1864, 58). However, as noted above,\nWhewell\u2019s view of necessary truth is a progressive one. This is\nas much the case in morality as in science. The realm of morality,\nlike the realm of physical science, is structured by certain\nFundamental Ideas: in this case, Benevolence, Justice, Truth, Purity,\nand Order (see 1852, xxiii). These moral ideas are conditions of our\nmoral experience; they enable us to perceive actions as being in\naccordance with the demands of morality. Like the ideas of the\nphysical sciences, the ideas of morality must be explicated before the\nmoral rules can be derived from them (see 1860a, 388). There is a\nprogressive intuition of necessary truth in morality as well as in\nscience. Hence it does not follow that because the moral truths are\naxiomatic and self-evident that we currently know them (see 1846,\n38\u20139). Indeed, Whewell claimed that \u201cto test self-evidence\nby the casual opinion of individual men, is a\nself-contradiction\u201d (1846, 35). Nevertheless, Whewell did\nbelieve that we can look to the dictates of positive law of the most\n\u201cmorally advanced\u201d societies as a starting point in our\nexplication of the moral ideas. Although he surely had a biased view\nof what societies were \u201cmorally advanced,\u201d he was not\ntherefore suggesting that the laws of those societies are the standard\nof morality. Just as we examine the phenomena of the physical world in\norder to explicate our scientific conceptions, we can examine the\nfacts of positive law and the history of moral philosophy in order to\nexplicate our moral conceptions. Only when these conceptions are\nexplicated can we see what axioms or necessary truths of morality\ntruly follow from them. Mill was therefore wrong to interpret\nWhewell\u2019s moral philosophy as a justification of the status quo\nor as constituting a \u201cvicious circle.\u201d Rather,\nWhewell\u2019s view shares some features of Rawls\u2019s later use\nof the notion of \u201creflective equilibrium.\u201d (For more on\nWhewell\u2019s moral philosophy, and his debate with Mill over\nmorality, see Snyder 2006, chapter four.)\n",
