    "main_text": "Culture of a Renaissance Man: Economics, Sorcery, Naturalism || Naturalism\n5.3 Naturalism\nIn the last years of his life Bodin dedicated himself ambitiously\nto his work, with which he hoped to penetrate the secrets of the\nuniverse. His Theater of Universal Nature (Theatrum)\nis a treatment of the science of nature, or natural philosophy.\nAccording to the title, the work addresses \u201cin five books the\nefficient and final causes of all things of the world.\u201d It is a\nwell-organized encyclopedia of universal knowledge in the form of a\ndialogue between Theorus, a curious theoretician who observers the\nworld and Mystagogus, a master and guide.  The first book examines the\nprincipals of nature and the origin and decline of the world. The\nsecond book addresses the natural elements of meteors, of rocks,\nmetals and fossils.  The third books explores types of animals; the\nfourth addresses the spirit, and the fifth book concerns the number,\nmovement, and grandeur of the heavens respectively. This is an example\nof those works of natural philosophy, which wished to be exhaustive,\nand were typical of the Renaissance. The accusations of naturalism and\natheism, which his Colloquium of the Seven About the Secrets of\nthe Sublime (Heptaplomeres) had provoked, were only\nreignited and expanded by the Theatrum, regardless of the\nfact that he repeatedly refers to an all-powerful creator who admires\nthe \u201corder\u201d in all things.\n",
