    "preamble": "\n\nThis entry covers major views of mind in the period of classical\nChinese philosophy (from about the 6th to the end of the\n3rd century BCE). The nearest equivalent to the English\nterm for mind in the classical period is xin \u5fc3, which\noriginated as a picture of the heart in human beings and animals and\ndirects body\u2019s behavior. Since ethical guidance in Chinese\nthought arises from both the cognitive function of the mind and the\naffective states attributed to the heart, xin is frequently\ntranslated as \u201cheart-mind\u201d. This translation will be used\nhere. The xin is credited with thinking si \u601d,\nunderstanding m\u00edng \u660e, knowing zhi\n\u77e5, intention zhi \u5fd7, felt moods and/or emotions\nqing \u60c5, and desire yu \u6b32. Xin\nplays a central role in Chinese ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics;\nand philosophical disputes often turn on how different schools or\nMasters portray the role of xin. How it arrives at\nethical guidance is a central point of contention between those who\ntreat the guidance as internal (Mengzi) to those who treat\nxin as navigating an external normative structure and those\nwho advocate emptying or ignoring the xin and taking guidance\nfrom some other organ or authority.\n\nThe term xin plays a major role in the classical texts with\nthe exception of the Mozi, where the discussion of many\nissues the other texts approach in terms of the heart-mind is couched\ninstead in terms of the knowing zhi \u77e5, the capacity,\nthe awareness or understanding, by which we come to know objects or\nacquire skills. Despite this difference, the Mozi shares with\nthe other classical texts a major concern for the learning and\npractice that enables people to act well and appropriately. The texts\nare profoundly practical, concerned with understanding how the\nheart-mind or the knowing works (descriptive epistemology, which has\nsurprising connections with contemporary cognitive and neuro-science)\nand how it should work (normative epistemology). What social\ninfluences should be trained into the heart-mind is a central concern\nof these texts\u2019 normative epistemology.\n\nPersistent issues that arise in Western discussions of the Chinese\ntheory of heart-mind involve its centrality to the person and the\nworld. As discussed below, different conceptions of the heart-mind in\nthe Chinese philosophical tradition motivate important distinctions in\nthe account of its role in the body (the Mengzi and the\nXunzi), in knowing and skills or crafts (the Mozi),\nand in relation to other natural creatures (the Daodejing and\nthe Zhuangzi).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The heart-mind and its ontological relation to the body in classical Chinese philosophy\n\nComparative interpreters frequently address whether the heart-mind is\nconceived as being separate or ontologically distinct from the body as\nthey are, for example, in Cartesian dualism. The dominant view in\nscholarship is that Chinese thought is not dualistic in any fashion.\nThe minority view is that it does not fall into ontological\ndualism, and that it is all the better for avoiding it, but other\nforms of dualism may fairly be attributed to Chinese thought.\n1.1 Holistic interpretations of the relationship between heart-mind and body\n\nRoger T. Ames interprets the heart-mind and body as parts of a process\nhe calls \u201cbodyheartminding\u201d. He identifies the medium of\nthis process as qi (\u6c23), the \u201cvital energy\nfield\u201d (Ames 2015: 173). What we call \u201cthings\u201d are\npersistent yet transitory perturbations of physical and psychic\nenergy. Life is a process of real energy. In a similar vein,\nFran\u00e7ois Jullien (2005 [2007]) contrasts the Greek separation\nof body or \u201corganic being\u201d, and the principle of life or\n\u201canimation\u201d, (2005 [2007: 56\u201359]) on the one hand,\nwith the Chinese view that organic being and animation both emerge\nfrom qi, \u201cbreath-energy\u201d, on the other hand. All\nthings are condensations or coagulations of a \u201cdiffuse and\ninvisible flow of energy that wends its way ceaselessly through the\nworld, animating as it goes\u201d (2005 [2007: 76]). In China, the\nphenomena associated in the West with the soul is light, refined\nqi (breath) while bone is denser qi. Jullien sees no\nontological divide in these graduated distinctions in Chinese\nthought.\n1.2 Critical discussion of holistic interpretations\n\nAmes\u2019s and Jullien\u2019s interpretations treat Chinese\nphilosophy as starting from the unity to which Western monists like\nHeraclitus, Spinoza, and Whitehead and the pragmatists William James\nand John Dewey aspired. The matter of modern physics, moreover, is\ncontinuous with energy. The puzzles of quantum entanglement suggest\nthe entire universe might be intermeshed in a single holistic process,\nnot a plethora of separable events in mechanistic causal chains.\n\nIn Chinese thought, qi constitutes not merely the somatic,\nbodily dynamics, but also the motivating force of thoughts, emotions,\nand intentions of the individual. Originally identified with the blood\nand breath of living animals, Zou Yan\u2019s theory of qi as\nthe stuff of everything became China\u2019s common view. The\nMengzi (latinized form \u201cMencius\u201d, 4th\ncentury BCE) postulates a coherence of qi in the world with\nthe qi of the heart-mind. He asserts the will, the capacity\nof the heart-mind to form aims or intentions, directs (shuai\n\u5e25) the body\u2019s qi (Mengzi 2A8). When he\nis asked what he means by saying that he is good at nourishing his\nflood-like qi, he answers that his qi is exceedingly\ngreat and strong, and if he nourishes it with uprightness\n(zhi \u76f4), it will fill the space between Heaven and\nearth (Mengzi 2A14). Qi, cultivated in appropriate\nways, realizes the moral virtues attributed to the heart-mind.\nMencius\u2019s heart-mind is the part of a person\u2019s qi\nthat has the function of guiding the rest of its qi.\n\nOn the other hand, Chinese popular beliefs about ghosts and spirits\nhave been discussed as weighing against or at least calling into\nquestion the idea that Chinese thought is free of dualistic\ntendencies. One such belief that appears in some early Chinese texts,\nsuch as the Chunqiu Zuozhuan\nzhu\u6625\u79cb\u5de6\u50b3\u6ce8), is that if people\ndie a violent death, their po \u9b44 soul and their\nhun \u9b42 soul become stirred up and take malicious action\nagainst the living. This suggests the hun and po\nsouls are hived off from the body\u2019s qi, perhaps in a\nvery rarefied form. Nowhere is there a clear and consistent statement\nruling this out (Goldin 2015: 62, n. 13). Separate from ghosts, early\nChinese texts refer to shen (\u795e) as somethings ghosts\nmay or may not have which gives the capacity for behavior guidance\nthat the living have. It is sometimes depicted as leaving the body at\ndeath and taking up residence in a realm where it can be addressed\nthrough sacrificial rituals by descendants. Translators routinely\nrender shen as \u201cspirit\u201d, that sapient part of a\nperson that can be cultivated to promote by their behavior what is\ncentral or important in the world. (Zhuangzi and\nXunzi). Neither bifurcates shen from qi but\nsuggests shen is the special kind of qi that is pure\nenergy\u2014like light.\n\nPaul Goldin points out passages in the Zhuangzi\n(\u838a\u5b50) where the heart-mind seems to be unaffected by\nquite drastic changes in the body, e.g., (Zhuangzi, Da\nZongshi \u5927\u5b97\u5e2b, sec. 5; Goldin 2003: 228).\nEdward Slingerland (2013) cites another passage in Zhuangzi\n(De Chong Fu \u5fb7\u5145\u7b26, sec. 4), a story of\npiglets who stop nursing at the body of their dead mother and run\naway, sensing she was not like them. They didn\u2019t love their\nmothers shape (xing \u5f62) but what moved or commanded\n(shi \u4f7f) it. Slingerland also cites what he describes\nas a random sample pre-Qin texts, including the recently discovered\nGuodian texts which he believes to manifest a strong folk belief in a\ndistinction of some sort. He acknowledges that his reading of the\npassages is controversial but hopes that it is supported by his\ncomprehensive sampling of texts. He allows that the distinction might\nnot be the Western ontological, substance dualism.\n\nThe distinction, he notes, is not a fundamental dualism of substance\nbut of a range of phenomena, from the bodily organ xin to the\npo and hun ghosts to the sapient shen\nwhich, Slingerland notes, can be compounded. And in\nMengzi 2A, the heart-mind and bodily qi interact:\nthe heart-mind not only commands the qi through its\nintentions, but can be moved by its qi when it is not unified\nin its intentions. Unlike Descartes\u2019 mind, xin\u2019s\nqi can interact with both the body\u2019s qi and\nthe wider qi filling the space between Heaven and earth. That\nimage merges physical stuff, the body and heart-mind in a spiritual\nand moral, as well as physical, space. It suggests human unity with\nthe rest of the world as an organic whole.\n\nThe heart-mind is not only the seat of cognition but also of emotions\nand desires, which consist of qi. Chinese philosophers do not\nexplain behavior by a combination of cognitive and affective factors.\nFinally, even though Slingerland labels the strong holism defended by\nAmes and Jullien a \u201cmyth\u201d, he grants that in early Chinese\nphilosophy neither the mind nor postmortem spirits are immaterial.\nThey are rather some rarefied stuff that is continuous with natural\nphysical world (Slingerland 2013: 37). He (2013: 9) calls this\ninterpretive option a \u201cweak holism\u201d. Raphals (2015:\n133\u201334) observes that there is no clear boundary between\n\u201cweak holism\u201d and \u201cweak dualism\u201d. Given that\nphysicalism acknowledges the continuity of matter and energy, we can\nperhaps circumvent these attempts to fit Chinese philosophy into\nWestern categories, and simply observe a similar continuity of these\nelements of Chinese qi-naturalism that explain the functions\nof the heart-mind, thinking, feeling and intentions in behavior. The\nrest of bodily qi, as the Mengzi says, carries out\nthe commands of the heart-mind, or as the Zhuangzi responds,\nother bodily organs (e.g., the stomach) can exert their own\nmotivational influence, and their guidance sometimes manifests itself\nin behavior.\n\nWe conclude the Chinese view is a genuine alternative to substance\ndualism, differing from reductive materialism in a way arguably\ncompatible with modern physics. This could lead one to treat the\nChinese conception of qi as referring to matter-energy while\nnot having the same intension. It leaves open the choice to see it as\na form of panpsychism (David Chalmers 1996 and Thomas Nagel 1979) or\nnot.\n\nFunctional distinctions between heart-mind and body accord with the\nfunctional holism exhibited by organic wholes constituted by systems\nof their parts (Wang 2013; Wong 2020). The relationships are sometimes\ncharacterized as \u201ccorrelative\u201d. What is meant by this term\nvaries (see Granet 1934; Needham 1954; Graham 1989; Hall & Ames\n1998), but all refer to analogies between kinds (lei\n\u7c7b). The most general of these kinds were yin and\nyang, two types of qi that constitute other things\nby their interaction: yin to contract and yield (associated\nwith darkness and the feminine), and yang to expand and\ndominate associated with light and the masculine). Together, they form\na whole, whether in the world or the human person. Their interaction\ncan involve opposition, complementarity, and cyclical alternation\n(Wang 2013).\n\nThough the nature of the interactions is sometimes described as\nnon-causal, the contrast is most plausibly made with reference to\nmechanical and linear notions of causation in which the effect (like a\nbilliard ball hit by another billiard ball) is purely passive and\ninert. The interactions envisioned in Chinese philosophy are not\nnecessarily incompatible with alternative notions of causation in\nwhich the cause \u201cworks with the tendencies of the thing\naffected\u201d (Perkins 2019). This is in keeping with the paradigm\nof wholes being the biological and the organic. Mengzi conceives of\nmoral seeds/sprouts in human nature (discussed in\n \u00a72.4\n below) that grow into moral virtues through the agent\u2019s moral\nreflection and action as these are influenced by secure material\nlivelihood and ethical education. Cultivating a person\u2019s\nvirtue-seed, then, is an instance of external factors interacting with\ninnate tendencies.\n\nOne distinctive characteristic of Chinese philosophy is its practical\nand ethical orientation (\u2018ethical\u2019 is here meant broadly\nto include all normative guidance and not merely morality). Daoist\ndao is broader than the moralist\u2019s concern with\nyi (morality). The Zhuangzi focuses on this broad\nsense of how (the way) to live (see\n \u00a72.5\n below). The organization and function of these parts of humans as\nwell as our interaction as part of the natural world (natural\ndao) are relevant to this discussion. The Confucians,\nespecially Mengzi, focus more inwardly on a hierarchy of\nfunctions/organs. Daoists, and to a lesser degree, Mohists and the\nXunzi address a broader arrangement of humans as a part of\nnature. These different conceptions of how the heart-mind is to relate\nto other parts of the body (the appetites and moods) and natural world\nground ethical discussion in ancient China. The Zhuangzi\noffers a less hierarchical conception than the Mengzi.\n2. Normative conceptions of the person\n\nHow should the heart-mind relate to other parts of the person? What is\nknowing? What is the role of reflective thinking about emotions,\ndesires, etc. as inputs to the heart-mind? These are the questions\nposed in Classical discussions of how to live.\n\nThe tendency in early Chinese Confucianism was to distinguish among\nand to rank parts of the person, with the heart-mind in the lead. The\nleading role is holistic in important ways, involving integration of\nthe perceiving, thinking, desiring, emotional, and intending functions\nof the heart-mind. Further, the resulting conceptions of virtue are of\nexcellence physically embodied and realized in relationship with\nothers.\n\nThe Mohists emphasized the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d especially of\nthe common people and the operation of tools of measurement that\nenable people to come to more reliable agreement in cooperative\narrangements. This focus on measuring fueled their tilt toward\nutilitarianism as the goal of personal and social organization of\nparts.\n\nThe texts that came to be associated with Daoism, the\nDaodejing \u9053\u5fb7\u7d93 and the Zhuangzi,\ntreat the heart-mind as only part of the process of de\n\u5fb7 (practical competence) of political leaders, artisans,\ngymnasts, and philosophers. Knowing how to live involves a combination\nof wisdom, skill, and disciplined engagement of emotion and desire. In\nthe Daodejing, the heart-mind\u2019s conduit of guidance\nfunction is often treated as emptiness and stillness to attune and be\nresponsive to an external path dao \u9053, path or way to\nlive in the natural cosmos. Human dao is a part of a holistic\nnatural dao that accounts for the emergence and guidance of\nall natural kinds.\n\nIn the Zhuangzi, this sometimes takes the form of demoting\nthe heart-mind\u2019s role in favor of a more egalitarian involvement\nof all parts of a person\u2019s system of qi (conceived as\npervading all the organs, not just in the heart-mind). The full body\nachieves attunement and responsiveness to the world\u2014as in skills\nranging from archery to wheelmaking to cicada catching.\n\nThe Xunzi builds on previous Confucian ideas about hierarchy\nwithin the person, but also incorporates ideas from Zhuangzi as well\nas implicitly taking from their pragmatic conception of knowing and\nexplicitly replying to Mohist reformism and Daoist skepticism of past\nmodels of music and ritual.\n2.1 The Analects\n\nThe Analects (Lun Yu \u8ad6\u8a9e) is the text\ntraditionally taken to be the most reliable reflection of the\nteachings of the historical Kongzi \u5b54\u5b50 (latinized name\n\u201cConfucius\u201d 551\u2013479 BCE; see entry on\n Confucius, \u00a72.1\n for more information on the Analects). Confucius presents\nhimself as transmitting ethical guidance from ancient Sages (see Jiang\n2021). The heart-mind of the junzi \u541b\u5b50\n(exemplary person) and the sheng ren \u8056\u4eba (sage)\nthus play pivotal roles of examples of how to morally cultivate people\nwho can, advise rulers or themselves become rulers.\n\nIn Analects 2.4, Confucius presents a mini autobiography that\nidentifies several stages in his moral cultivation. At age fifteen he\nset his heart-mind on learning (all references to the text in Chinese\nwill be to Analects, CTP, unless otherwise indicated). At\nthirty, he was able to take his stand (his place in society). At forty\nhe had no perplexities (performed role-rituals flawlessly). At fifty\nhe knew the mandate of Tian \u5929 (his nature-assigned\nmission). At sixty, his ears were attuned (spontaneously reacted to\nspoken cues). At seventy, he could follow his heart-mind\u2019s\ndesires without overstepping the boundaries.\n\nThe stages indicate the centrality of learning and practice to the\nheart-mind. Moral cultivation was learning one\u2019s role well. At\nseventy his learning made him an unerring in his second-nature\nresponses to situations with no inclination to immoral behavior. This\nholistic cultivation is inherent in the heart-mind as guiding behavior\naccording to a learned role\u2014which one views as natural for\noneself. Cultivation encompasses the whole person, not just the\nheart-mind, but the qi of the body.\n\nMoral excellence throughout that text is embodied. Book 10 contains\nclose observations of Confucius\u2019 ways of speaking, his physical\nbearing, facial expressions, gestures, and bodily postures as they\nvary over different contexts. In his home village, he looked humble\nand hesitant in his speech, but in the ancestral temple or at court,\nhe spoke articulately but carefully (Analects 10.1). The way\nhe carried himself upon entering the duke\u2019s gate showed his\nreverence for the office (10.4). Upon seeing someone in mourning\ndress, even an intimate associate, he took on a solemn expression, or\nriding past someone in mourning, he would bow to the crossbar of his\ncarriage (10.25).\n\nThe different ways his physical bearing and movements express respect\nand sympathy according to context is related to the way that moral\ncultivation involves dedicated performance of rituals that attach to\none\u2019s roles, such as greeting one\u2019s fellow villagers,\ngetting up to speak at the ancestral temple or at court, and greeting\nthose in mourning. Performing these rituals is a way of training\noneself to have the desired affective and bodily stances toward\nothers. Performance constitutes an individualized expressions of moral\nexcellence. Confucius thus becomes a model from which others may\nlearn. Modeling was key to this learning process. Knowing one\u2019s\nroles is knowing one\u2019s \u201cnames\u201d as they pertain to\nthese roles, and rituals constitute a self-training in how to perform\none\u2019s named role: let the ruler rule, the minister minister, the\nfather father, and the son son (Analects 12.11; see also\n13.3).\n\nThe heart-mind is expected to take the lead in cultivation of the\nentire person: \u201csetting one\u2019s heart-mind on\nlearning\u201d. Its learning is not knowing facts but performing a\nbehavior guided by a model. The student follows examples of moral\nstandards. This eventually lets one to achieve moral excellence,\nshaping one\u2019s desires and emotions so that they do \u201cnot\noverstep the bounds\u201d, and so that the whole person is attuned to\nTian\u2019s calling. Yan Hui (a remarkable student whose\nearly death breaks Confucius\u2019 heart) is praised by Confucius for\nnever repeating the same mistake (Analects 6.3), and for a\nheart-mind that didn\u2019t deviate in its focus on practicing\nren \u4ec1for three months. Others could maintain focus for\nonly days or a month (6.7). In the Analects, ren is\nis this comprehensive moral excellence. Confucius sums it up as loving\nor caring for persons (12.22). Later the Mengzi, would\nidentify ren as the particular virtue often translated as\n\u201cbenevolence\u201d. Here we translate ren as\n\u201chuman-heartedness\u201d. The heart-mind\u2019s aim\n(zhi \u5fd7) on becoming ren is all-important. In\n9.26, Confucius says,\n\n\nThe three armies may be deprived of their commander, but even\ncommoners cannot be deprived of their aim. All commit to their aim as\narmies to protecting their commander.\n\n\nConfucian ethics centers on an ideal of fully-realizing humanity. The\nideal is rooted in family relationships and grows to all social\nrelations. Thus, learning about the heart-mind of others is crucial to\nethical cultivation. When he is asked whether there is a single word\nthat can sum up his guidance, Confucius replies, \u201cIt is\nsympathetic understanding (shu \u6055): what you do not\nwant, do not do to others\u201d (Analects 15.24). This has\nbeen called the \u201cnegative\u201d Golden Rule of Confucianism,\nand 6.30 supplies the positive version when Confucius says that\nren people (\u4ec1\u4eba) wishing to establish themselves\nalso seek to establish others and in wishing to be a model of\nexcellence, helps others achieve excellence. He goes on to say that to\nbe able to draw from what is close as an analogy is called the method\nof ren. The Doctrine of the Mean in the Book of\nRites (Liji \u79ae\u8a18 Zhongyong\n\u4e2d\u5eb8) comments further on what shu might mean\nwhen applied to sympathetically understanding others to whom one\nstands in a role relationship: to serve my father as I would expect my\nson to serve me, to serve my ruler as I would expect my minister to\nserve me, to serve elder brothers as I expect younger brothers to\ntreat me, and to treat my friends as I expect my friends to serve me\n(Liji Zhongyong 13).\n\nShu is a method for achieving shared moral excellence in\ncommunion with social others. One reflects on what is close to guide\none\u2019s aspirations to a life in a human social community.\nOne\u2019s desire for excellence is not transparent but emerges over\na lived life with others. Confucius\u2019s conception of moral\nprogress is sensitive to differences in each life circumstance, from\nformative early social roles to physical characteristics and\ntemperament. One sympathizes with others by identifying both relevant\nsimilarities and differences. Each person\u2019s heart-mind\nis similarly sensitive to their particular capacities and roles in\ntheir lives as they unfold.\n\nIn one conversation, Confucius suggests to his students Zilu and Yan\nHui that they each tell what they would most like to do. Zilu says\nthat he would like to share his horses and carriages, his clothing and\nfurs, with his friends, and if they damage them, to bear them no ill\nwill. Yan Hui says he would like to refrain from bragging about his\nown abilities, and to not exaggerate his own accomplishments. When\nthey ask the Master what he would most like to do, Confucius replies\nthat he would like to bring peace and contentment to the aged, to\nshare relationships of trust and confidence with his friends, and to\nlove and protect the young (Analects 5.26 [1998]).\nZilu\u2019s and Yan Hui\u2019s statement of their aspirations\nreflect their particular preoccupations as individuals.\nConfucius\u2019 statement not only comprehends their aspirations as\nparticular ways of fulfilling his own, but identifies what everyone\nmight ultimately want. The heart-mind, then, is the source of\nattunement not only to the Dao of Tian but to the\nothers with whom one\u2019s relationships go into a fully realized\nsocial life.\n\nThe use of analogy in setting forth a fundamental tenet signals the\ncentrality of this type of reasoning in Confucianism and in Mohism, as\nshall be seen below. Analogy plays an important role in the\nMozi but gets incorporated into a conception of knowledge as\nskillfully and reliably classifying things and distinguishing them\nfrom each other so that one may act rightly and benevolently in the\nworld.\n2.2 The Mohists\n\nThe Mozi (\u58a8\u5b50) is named after its founder Mo\nDi (\u58a8\u7fdf, 470\u2013391 BCE). The school of Mohism is\nrightly credited for bringing argumentation into Chinese philosophy\n(Hansen 1992). It is revealing that Mengzi says in 3B9 that while he\nis not fond of arguments, he is compelled to argue with the Yangists\nand the Mohists because \u201ctheir language (yan) fills the\nworld beneath the sky\u201d. The Mohists contrast utilitarian\nconsequentialism with reliance on tradition. Tian\n(sky-nature) desires human well-being. Traditional rituals guiding\nconduct or social and political policies should be reformed to improve\npeople\u2019s livelihood. The argument is a strong one against total\nreliance on tradition, but Mozi seems to compromise when he reflects\non the standards of correct yan (language use\u2014see\nbelow). He shares Confucius\u2019 insight about the role of learning\nto the heart-mind\u2019s guidance of behavior. He also shares\nConfucius\u2019 view of the role of political leader as\neducator-in-chief. If the ruler\u2019s speech and behavior promote\nuniversal human well-being, the people\u2019s behavior will change\n\u201cin a single generation\u201d.\n\nMozi\u2019s focus on developing a social and political dao\nthat creates and sustains general well-being starts from assumptions\nabout the heart-mind different from the Confucians. He envisions a\ncounterpart of Hobbes \u201cstate of nature\u201d with the important\ndifference that the disorder is not a produce of universal\nself-interest but of moral disagreement. Everyone is assumed to be\nmotivated morally, but to have different \u7fa9 yi\n(moralities). The social project he imagines is one of unifying the\nvarying conceptions of morality.\n\nThat social project, however, presupposed another fundamental\npsychological assumption\u2014that the social world could identify\nand agree on who was \u201cwisest and best\u201d to lead the social\nconstruction project. And the project itself hints at some assumptions\nabout human psychology. The leader, apparently selected by\nacclimation, admits he\u2019s unable to unify all the world\u2019s\nmoralities. He appoints a Confucian-style hierarchical bureaucracy to\nassist him. Each level of the hierarchy reports to those in the next\nhigher level. Still, even those at the bottom of the hierarchy (e.g.,\nthe village) admit their inability to say what is moral, so they\nconsult with ordinary people, who are to report what they find moral\nand immoral. This stage is where Mozi speaks of punishing whoever will\nnot cooperate in this project of social morality construction by\nwithholding judgment.\n\nEach level of the construction bureaucracy reports up the hierarchy.\nHowever, the original assumption of moral disagreement is seemingly\nignored. Either at each level, there is no disagreement or the officer\ntaking the reports resolves disagreements somehow. The\n\u201cwisest and best\u201d makes the final decision. Hints of how\nthat decision is made come from the contributions Mohists make to\ndeveloping a Chinese practical conception of knowing (zhi\n\u77e5). Practical knowing, knowing-how, can underlie how we use\nwords and how we adapt modeled behavior in our own practice. The skill\nwe learn in learning \u540dm\u00edng (names or terms) is learning\nto \u8faf bian (divide) into \u662f shi this and\n\u975efei not-that. When paired, the translators routinely\nuse \u201cright-wrong\u201d as in right-from-wrong, right and wrong,\nright or wrong. The demonstrative form reminds us that such choices\nare made in real-time contexts.\n\nMozi suggests three standards for right and wrong use of terms:\n\nLooking to the roots and original baptism with terms by the Sage\nKings and in accordance with the historical record of their ritual\nbehaviors. This is Mozi\u2019s compromise with Confucianism.\nContinuity in language is important if know-how from the past is to be\nsuccessfully stored and transmitted to later generations.\nAccording with the eyes and ears of the people, a kind of\nintersubjective consensus of observation. This \u201cempirical\u201d\nstandard informs Mohist emphasis on measurement operations.\n\n\n\nThe hundred artisans make squares with the set square, circles with\nthe compass, straight lines with the string, vertical lines with the\nplumb line, and flat surfaces with the level. Whether skilled artisans\nor unskilled artisans, all take these five as models. The skilled are\nable to conform to them exactly. The unskilled, though unable to\nconform to them exactly, by following them in undertaking their work\nstill do better than they do on their own. (Mozi CTP: Book\n1.4 [trans. 2020: book 4.1])\n \nTheir practical use leads to general benefit. (Mozi CTP:\nBook 9.1\u20132 [trans. 2020: book 35])\n\n\nThese standards seem potentially incoherent in that there seems no\nguarantee that the results of applying one will be the same as the\nresults of applying the others. One way to help is make utility the\nprimary standard which justifies and guides application of the other\ntwo standards: past usage is to be maintained to preserve social\nknow-how and coordination practices which benefit the people. Making\nusage reflect ordinary empirical judgments makes learning easier and\napplication more reliable. Mozi\u2019s conception of usefulness is\nrobustly natural-bodily goods: food, clothing, housing, time with and\ncare for parents etc. He not only does not focus on pleasure, he\ndisapproves of it. \u6a02 (le pleasure or yue\nmusic\u2014especially royal concerts and funerals) wasted material\ngoods and labor. Stable families and social order included filiality.\nThe early Mohist conception of benefit, therefore, seems to have been\nconstituted by a plurality of basic social goods, which indicates\ntheir social and political orientation towards identifying a\ndao or guiding path for society.\n\nThis solution has the advantage of explaining curious aspects of\nMozi\u2019s defense of \u201cthere are ghosts\u201d and opposition\nto \u201cthere is fate\u201d. He explains the first by testimony as\nto the appearance and actions of ghosts who punish wrongdoers and\nreward those who do what is right. However, chapter 31 of the Mozi\nsimply justifies sacrifices on the grounds that the sage-kings\npracticed them, and the doctrine promotes good effects among the\nliving (i.e., sacrificial ceremonies to spirits build kinship among\nthe living and provide them with the food and wine). It suggests\nghosts do not exist but teaching and acting on their existence is\nbeneficial. It is probably a mistake to infer from this one passage\nthat the early Mohists theorized about truth vs. pragmatic benefits of\nbelief, though later Mohists may be interpreted as noticing such a\ndistinction.\n\nThe early Mohist primacy of the benefit standard makes its ethics the\nfirst consequentialist ethic in history. Destructive conflict among\npeople, families, and states is diagnosed in the Mozi as due\nto conflicting social mores and relative bias toward our own family,\nvillage, state and culture. Utilitarian reasoning yields a normative\npsychological solution: adopt jian ai (\u517c\u611b)\n(Mozi, CTP: book 4, chapters 14\u201316 [trans. 2020: books\n14\u201316]). Sometimes translated as \u201cuniversal love\u201d\nbut now more often as \u201cinclusive\u201d or \u201cimpartial\ncaring\u201d, it is best understood as opposed to an exclusive focus\non the well-being of oneself and one\u2019s relatives as the source\nof destructive behavior (for discussion of these controversies, see\nentries on\n Mohism\n and\n Chinese ethics).\n Jian ai is a moral attitude of care towards everyone and\nsupports governance that distributes benefits to all, taking special\ncare of those in need and less able to provide for themselves. The\nMohists assume (arguably with Confucians) that our heart-minds are\nshaped by the teachings promoted by social leaders\u2014starting with\nthe ruler.\n\nJian ai is a moral attitude of care towards everyone and\nsupports governance that distributes benefits to all, taking special\ncare of those in need and less able to provide for themselves. The\nMohists assume (arguably with Confucians) that our heart-minds are\nshaped by the teachings promoted by social leaders\u2014starting with\nthe ruler.\n\nThe later Mohists shifted most weight to an empirical standard and\ntaught that the language to be used should emphasize something more\nlike \u201ccarving nature at the joints\u201d. The main object of\nall learning was skills in sorting things reliably into their correct\ncategories according to the patterns of their similarities and\ndifferences (Mozi, CTP: Book 12.8 [trans. 2020: Book 47.9]).\nInterest in human well-being expressed itself in widening interest in\nknowing the natural world. The utilitarian core was\nren\uff08\u4ec1\uff09the virtue of impartial or\ninclusive care and the behavior was yi (\u7fa9) morally\nright. The Mohist concept of measurement standards (fa\n\u6cd5) remain central in this realist later Mohist phase. The\nzhi \u5fd7will of Tian (Sky or Nature),\nMozi\u2019s original source of normative guidance, was\nmeasurement-like utility. We naturally choose the lesser of two harms\nand greater of two benefits.\n\nThe role of Tian in Mohism suggests a kind of naturalism in\ntheir conception of psychology and the capacity to adopt an attitude\nof jian ai. In chapter 28 on Tian\u2019s intent,\nMozi says that he measures Tian nature\u2019s intent as a\nwheelwright measures with a compass and a carpenter the square.\nTian\u2019s intent is a command, but a pattern in\nthings\u2014flipping the Western argument from design. The world is\nhere for human benefit. It benefits and nourishes everyone; it rewards\nsocieties who act together and share and harm those that do not. It\nmakes no distinction among humans and provides life and sustenance to\nrich and poor, noble and low, kin and non kin; it created the regular\nand constant pattern of the seasons and weather that makes all these\nbroadly distributed benefits possible.\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 theories revolve around the concept of\n\u8fafbian distinctions in language. The role of\nTian is tied to nature\u2019s joints, natural points of\ndistinction. The natural normative distinction is between benefit and\nharm. Appealing to that distinction as a measure of \u201cthis\u201d\nand \u201cnot-that\u201d yields a naturalistic argument for\nuniversal concern in government. Bian comes to be used of any\ntheorist\u2019s justifying of a guiding distinction. This makes the\nMohist use of the concept unlike \u201cargument\u201d in Western\nphilosophy. The conventional translation is misleading. The Mohists\ndid not conceive of arguments as consisting of premises and a\nconclusion and a form that guaranteed truth was preserved. It is\nrather that some distinctions are assumed in arguing for other\ndistinctions. The Mohists appeal to distinctions where nature takes a\nstand as in operational use of a measurement tool. Compasses,\ncarpenter\u2019s squares, and plumb lines, give reliable and precise\ndistinctions for sorting and choosing. This guides effective and\nbeneficial action and policy in government both because nature is\ninvolved and ordinary people, using their eyes and ears, can recognize\nand acknowledge the result. This makes the operational measurement\nuseful as well as reliable and accurate (true).\n\nThe Mohist conception of bian is deeply pragmatic. The ways\nof teaching language and behavior is ultimately guided by the natural\nbian of benefit-harm\u2014arguably a distinction deeply\nembedded in our heart-minds. This pragmatism is also illustrated by\nthe different kinds of appeal they make in their arguments for\njian ai. Given their view that chaotic conflict results from\neveryone acting on their own view of what is right, one might infer\nthat they believe people to be typically motivated to do what they\nthink is right. However, they argue for jian ai on other\nnormative grounds besides its naturalness. It seems to require both\nmodeling from the leader and a punishment and reward structure. There\nis not much worry over the tensions between saying that Tian\nand other supernatural agents reward and punish to enforce the moral\norder and also asserting the need for a strict and rigid hierarchical\ngovernment structure that incentivizes conformity to that moral order.\nPerkins (2014) puts the problem of evil in its most general form: bad\nthings happen to good people, and this regular occurrence troubles\naccepting that Tian or nature is equally benevolent to all\nhuman beings. In a philosophical tradition that is developing\nvigorous, argumentative debate, that belief will become increasingly\ntroubled. This may be a reason why Tian drops out of the\ndiscourse of the later Mohists, who contributed to increasing\nconceptual resources for debate.\n\nThe later Mohists kept the basic outlines of the consequentialist\nethic that Mozi and the early followers developed, but further\ndeveloped and revised that ethic along with their methodology of\nargument, philosophy of language and epistemology. In addition, they\nwrote on metaphysical topics such as causality and space and time, and\nin a number of the sciences such as geometry and mechanics. Their\nwritings comprise six chapters of the Mozi (see CTP: chapters\n40\u201345 [trans. 2020: part IV]). The later Mohists are true to\ntheir forebearers in conceiving the cognitive capabilities of human\nbeings as functioning to bian discern different kinds and\nidentifying which things belonged or did not belong to these kinds.\nThough these capabilities involve empirical contact with the world,\nthe later Mohists didn\u2019t invoke mental representations of\npropositions. The contact makes the heart-mind aware of distinctions,\nboundaries of things. And this information guides the practical\nability to sort things appropriately for behavior. Assigning a name to\na thing or thing to a name is sorting into shi, right or\nthis, and fei, wrong or not-that. The translation of\nbian as argument leads some to attribute the Mohists with\ndeveloping syllogistic reasoning. They rather cultivate skill or\nknow-how in carving the world with linguistic distinctions. They\nreflect no conception of reasoning with ideas, mentalistic\nitems in container-like heart-mind. The primary term of epistemology\nis \u201cknowing\u201d zhi \uff08\u77e5), which is a\ncapacity like eyesight (Mozi, CTP: Book 10 Canon I.3 [trans.\n2020: books 40\u20133, A3]. They are focused on the capabilities or\nskills to reliably sort out the relations between various kinds, e.g.,\nthat the category of oxen belongs to the larger category of\nanimals.\n\nAs to the question of whether the later Mohists made more fundamental\nchanges to their tradition, scholars diverge in their interpretations.\nA.C. Graham, in his influential Disputers of the Tao, saw the\nlater Mohists as engaging in a kind of a priori\nsystematization of the earlier ethic through a series of interlocking\ndefinitions of crucial terms such as ren and yi\n(Graham 1989: 146). Such a reading may be too much in tension with the\npragmatic reliabilism exhibited by their concern to sort things out\ninto the right kinds. Stephens (2021; see him also for a detailed\ncritique of Graham\u2019s interpretation) provides another\ninterpretation that has the later Mohists broadening their conception\nof benefit and harm on the basis of a preference satisfaction\ncriterion using pleasure and displeasure as indicators (Mozi,\nCTP: Book 10 Canon I and Expositions 26\u201327 [trans. 2020: Books\n40\u20133 A 26\u201327]). This addresses criticisms they might have\nreceived about the narrowness of the earlier list of benefits, as well\nas the Zhuangzi\u2019s point about the diversity of things\nthat people value (see\n \u00a72.5\n below). The later Mohists also introduced the conception of weighing\nbenefits and harms, which makes possible an all-things-considered\njudgment as to what actions or policies most benefit or least harm a\nsociety (Mozi, CTP: Book 11.3, 11.5 [trans. 2020: Books\n44.3a\u2013c, 44.5 ]). They recognized the permissibility of\nbenefiting one\u2019s parents and the elderly more than others\n(Mozi, CTP: Book 11.6 [trans. 2020: Book 44.6), perhaps in\nresponse to criticism from Confucians such as Mengzi. These changes in\nMohist philosophy indicate significant interaction and adjustment\nbetween the different traditions and have ramifications for an\nimplicit broadening of capacities of the heart-mind conception.\n2.3 The Daodejing\n\nThe Daodejing (\u9053\u5fb7\u7d93 The Book of the\nWay and Its Power) may have begun to take shape in fifth century\nBCE and reached the form as we know it in the second century CE\n(references to the Chinese text will be to the Daodejing in\nCTP). It shares with the Mozi the attribution of impartiality\nto the natural source of norms\u2014tian\u2019s dao.\nHowever, impartiality in the Daodejing is broader than it is\nin the Mozi. Chapter 10 celebrates its giving of life and its\nnurturance of all things, not only humans. Chapter 5 declares\nthat Tian and earth are not ren, that it treats the\nmyriad things as \u201cstraw dogs\u201d, i.e., ritual objects\ntreated reverently during the season of rites but afterwards tossed\naside. Rather than attributing callousness or cruelty to Tian\nand earth, the message is that each thing is given its time, which\nthen inevitably passes. It is not just that the desires fostered by\nConfucians and Mohists have no basis in Tian and earth. We\nproject our time and place\u2019s human concerns onto the natural\nworld in both social daos.\n\nThe Daodejing reminds us that the dao path metaphor\nused by the social moralists to talk about how people should live was\ntaken from its home domain of how things naturally came into being\n(ch. 14). It says both dao and tian follow\nziran natural or spontaneous (self-realized) unfolding (ch.\n25). The Daoist conception of paths is this natural path structure.\nLanguage and human social daos have path structure, but not all path\nstructure is in language or human affairs. Natural, tian\ndao\u2019s structure is a distribution of what is and what is\nnot\u2014you (being) and wu (non-being). The\nstructure of nature also emerges and evolves in nature. The first\nchapter says, the Daos can be dao-ed (guided or\nevolved). They are not constant daos. So dao only\nmoves forward, unlike physical law that applies forward and backward\nin time. The actual environmental context of unfolding of all things,\nnamed or not, moves in one direction as things self-realize their\nnon-being possibilities, the possibles which are not yet part of\nbeing. \u201cNon-being\u201d names the beginning of the cosmos\n(Tian and earth). \u201cBeing\u201d names \u201cthe mother\nof 10,000 kinds of things\u201d. Cosmic dao unfolds in\nsilence and effortlessly. It exists where there is emptiness that\ninvites filling with behavior (ch. 11).\n\nDao makes no names constant. Natural material (uncarved wood)\ncan be distributed to make utensils (ch. 28). But no human authority\ncan make uncarved wood its servant. When we take it into a human\nstructure, we use names. When we have names, we will know \u201cto\nstop\u201d (ch. 32). Why stop? Names of things generate desires that\ngo beyond natural desires. Nameless uncarved nature is free from such\ndesires and these are dangerous, competitive desires, e.g., for social\nstatus. This is the crux of Laozi\u2019s (\u201cOld Master\u201d or\nthe anonymous author\u2019s) view of psychology. Acquiring any social\ndao through learning names and ritual behaviors, takes us\naway from our natural self. Going back to that natural self is to\ncease to guide our behavior using social\nconstructs\u2014\u7121\u70ba wuwei is the paradigm of\nself-realization without social domination.\n\nThe Daodejing hints at other ways our self-nature is changed\nby learning language and a social dao. The distinctions\nmarked in language are poverty stricken in comparison to the ability\nof our eyes and ears to register hues and tones (ch. 11). Linguistic\ninstructions using names are more rigid and less\naccurate\u2014imagine trying to explain how to follow a forest trail\nby recipe-like instructions such as, \u201cWalk 7 steps NNE then turn\n12\u00ba west and take 4 steps, then \u2026\u201d. compared to\npointing to the trail. With natural dao, we respond to the\nsuppleness and constantly changing flux of ongoing experience of the\nworld (ch. 76). It could be said of much of Chinese philosophy but is\nmost dramatically presented in the Daodejing\u2019s stress\non constant, ceaseless transforming.\n\nNote that this view of the match between human naming and\nclassificatory capacity and the world runs against the view\npresupposed by the Mohists. Usefulness often presupposes some socially\nconstructed of name-influenced desire or value. So, it cannot mediate\nbetween different systems of constructing such values.\n\nThe Daodejing prizes attentiveness and responsiveness to the\npresent situation. Terms in language elide the differences in\nsituations. We see the world through the filter of our desires and try\nto manipulate things and other people to make names apply. We cannot\nstop the process of ceaseless change and unfolding.\n\nWe should neither elevate some people above others (so-called\nworthies), nor value things for their rarity only, nor seek out things\nof desire. These confuse the heart-mind. To achieve peaceful stable\nlife, sage leadership works to empty the people\u2019s minds of such\nthings so they focus simply on natural goals of adequate clothing,\nhealth, and control of our own lives. In the battle of nature and\nnurture, Laozi chooses nature. That is why the sage is for the belly\nand not the eye (beauty) (ch. 3).\n\nThis goal of emptying the heart-mind of inculcated desires and the\ncrude distinctions behind names forms the basis of the later blending\nof Daoism and Buddhism. We see hints of breath control and meditation\nmotivated by the paradox implicit in their goal\u2014nirvana or empty\nmind (ch. 10). The achievement is likened to returning to being a\nnewborn infant. A child\u2019s receptivity to the world is\ncelebrated. It finds its way as streams and rivers find valleys (ch. 6\nand 15). The ideal for the heart-mind is to find its own equilibrium\nin the world without the domination of a past culture\u2019s\npresuppositions. The heart-mind\u2019s calmness (stillness) and\nemptiness underpin this receptivity to undistorted nature. (ch. 16).\nThe heart-mind can attune to dao and follow its invitations\nto behavior. This conception of forming a unity, becoming one with\ndao, makes the heart-mind\u2019s self-realization the\nstandard guiding the changing dao (ch. 25). The heart-mind\nthat empties itself is able to attune to and participate in this\nprimordial movement of dao.\n\nThis unity of the empty and still heart-mind with the dao of\nunfolding is why wuwei can be efficacious. It emerges from\nsupple receptiveness to the moment or situation at hand. In the\nDaodejing, this is described as practicing teachings without\nwords, producing things without \u201cowning\u201d them, acting\nwithout expectation of reward, and not lingering after one\u2019s\nwork is done (ch. 2). Wu wei is contrasted with behavior to\nachieve a socially motivated end. Sometimes wuwei is\nidentified with spontaneous action, but not in the sense of impulsive\naction but of self-realization of possibilities offered by\ndao.\n\nThe text adopts various devices to help. Chapter 63 says to overcome\nthe hard while it is still easy and to achieve the large while it is\nsmall. Difficult things start with what is easy, and great things\nbegin with the small. Chapter 64 says to set things in order before\nthey become chaotic. These sayings suggest careful attending to things\nand a foresight born of perceiving incipient patterns of development.\nSuch careful attending may give rise to action that might be called\nspontaneous, not impulsive, but instead supremely responsive to\nothers. The responsiveness is transparent to the shape of\ndao\u2019s invitation to behavior.\n\nThe text signal\u2019s awareness that wuwei is practically\ncontradictory since it recommends a type of behavior using two social\nconcepts\u2014wu and wei (ch. 48). The text\n(especially the 2nd de book) charges into social\nand political ethics implied in this conception despite their\nnotorious tension with this anti-social domination beginning. The\ninvitations to behavior include social contexts. An open, transparent\npursuit of natural options include how one\u2019s actions are\ncomplementary to others as in a dance. One is sensitive to others so\nas to blend and complement one\u2019s energies with theirs.\nOur joint receptiveness gives us a dao\nwhich we self-realize in our joint behavior.\n\nThe political implication is the greatest sage rulers are barely known\nto the people; the next greatest are those who are loved; after that\ncome those who are feared, and after that those who are ridiculed.\nTasks are completed and duties are fulfilled, and the people simply\nsay that this is their natural way (ch. 17). Sage rulers do this by\nemptying their heart-mind and making the people\u2019s heart-minds\ntheir heart-mind (ch. 49).\n\nSome descriptions of how sage rulers do this seem controlling and\nmanipulative, where ancients good at enacting dao do not\nenlighten the people but keep them stupid and ignorant (ch. 65). This,\nhowever, is consistent with the basic worry about conventional\nknowledge as frustrating self-realization. Sage rulers themselves\nshould be \u201cwithout [such] knowledge\u201d and nurture the\npeople\u2019s unfolding future without commanding it (ch. 10). In\nchapter 20 the speaker refers to their own heart-mind as belonging to\na fool, empty of conventional wisdom.\n\nThe contrast is also with conventional morality. From the perspective\nof the Daodejing, the Confucians and Mohists are locked into\nan untenably anthropocentric view of Tian and earth that sees\nthem as somehow favoring humanity. The straw-dogs metaphor de-centers\nhumanity, placing it simply among the myriad things. Conventional\nmorality not only embodies an illusion. Following it does not make\nmatters better. Ren and yi, along with cleverness\nand deception, emerge when Dao is abandoned (ch. 18). When\nadopted to steer us toward a better course, its fixed values are too\nrigid to allow the flexible response to the flow of experience\nnecessary for efficacy; moreover, they become instruments of personal\nambition and attempts to outdo others. It is better renounce\nren, abandon yi, along with cleverness and profit,\nmaintaining simplicity and embracing plainness, reducing desires (ch.\n19).\n\nLaozi\u2019s philosophical psychology is reflected in\nThe Mengzi\u2019s more elaborate theory of the\nheart-mind\u2019s natural moral unfolding. A late chapter lists\nci \u6148 (compassion) among \u201cmy three\ntreasures\u201d (ch. 67). Ci figures centrally in how that\nConfucian text seeks to rehabilitate the Mozi\u2019s\nren (benevolence) and yi (morality). Mozi and Laozi\nhad put guidance in the natural world to which the heart-mind through\nits training could be attuned or prejudiced and unreceptive. Laozi and\nMengzi share a concern about the arbitrariness of education in mores.\nLaozi finds the map in the natural world; Mencius will find it in the\noriginal human mind.\n\nThe shared attitude in the ancient Chinese conception of mind in\nnature is the basic goodness of the world, but the rejection of\nanthropocentrism in Daoism\u2019s interpretation of Tian and\nearth puts into question the meaning of what this goodness could\nbe.\n2.4 The Mengzi\n\nThe Mengzi (unless otherwise indicated, all references to the\nChinese text will be to Mengzi in CTP) carries forward the\nidea that heart-mind should lead or command bodily qi (2A2).\nIn 6A15, he distinguishes the part of the person that is great from\nthe part that is small. Those who follow the great part become great\npersons and those who follow the small part become small persons. In\n6A14, nourishing the small part is associated with being given to\neating and drinking. This fits with the 6A15 association of the small\npart with faculties of hearing and sight that do not think and are led\nby things perceived through these senses. By contrast the faculty of\nthe heart-mind is to think, and it is the performance of this faculty\nthat is associated with establishing the greater part of ourselves.\nThis conception of the heart-mind as leader seems to overlap with the\ncontemporary conception of the executive functions of the mind:\nperception of patterns of similarity and difference in the world,\nresponding to these patterns through reasoning and feeling, setting\naims, and initiating action to achieve those aims.\n\nMengzi\u2019s conception of the heart-mind is holistic,\ni.e., it\u2019s guiding blends the heart-mind\u2019s thinking,\nemoting, desiring, and conating. The human heart-mind begins with\ninnate duan \u7aef, seeds or sprouts of goodness. Mencius\nattributes these to Tian\u2019s implanting them in human\nnature (ren xing \u4eba\u6027). These inborn\nduan are dispositions to feelings or emotions (qing\n\u60c5) linked with the body. Cognition also has a duan\nwhich takes the form of intuitions of right and wrong\n(\u662f\u975e shi-fei). When the heart-mind develops from\nthese sprouts it both acts well and grows in the sense that it\nacquires new moral knowledge and motivation to perform better in other\nsituations. Reasoning and reflecting on emotions therefore involve the\nbody. Therefore, when Mengzi says that the function of the heart-mind\nis to lead the rest of the person, he is not thereby contrasting\nsomething that is purely mental or cognitive with another thing that\nis purely physical or affective. The leading part of the person is\nboth mental, physical, cognitive, and affective (see entry on\n the emotions in early Chinese philosophy).\n\nMengzi numbers the duan, calling them the four heart-minds.\nEach develops into a different dimension of ethical excellence:\nceyin zhixin \u60fb\u96b1\u4e4b\u5fc3 (compassion)\ncan develop into ren \u4ec1 (human-heartedness);\nxiuwu\u7f9e\u60e1 (shame and dislike) can develop into\nyi\u7fa9 (righteousness); ciran\u8fad\u8b93\n(deference and yielding) can develop into li \u79ae (ritual\npropriety, etiquette); and shi/fei \u662f\u975e can\ndevelop into zhi\u667a or wisdom.\n\nThe heart-mind links humans with Tian. In 6A16, Mengzi\ndistinguishes the nobility of Tian from the nobility of\nhumans. Human-heartedness, righteousness, loyalty, truthfulness, and\ntaking untiring pleasure in doing good is the nobility of\nTian. Being a duke, minister, or high-ranking official is the\nnobility of humans. In 2A2, Mengzi states his \u201cunmoved\nheart-mind\u201d enables him to remain steady in the face of\ninevitably uncertain fortune in pursuit of the nobility of humans. He\nachieved this state, he explains, through cultivating his flood-like\nqi. He cultivates it through the formation of zhi\n(intent or aim; see also Analects 9.26), which\nrightly leads and nourishes the body\u2019s qi. If\nnourished uprightly, it fills the space between Tian and\nearth. The suggestion here is that Tian\u2019s goodness,\nimplanted in human nature, runs throughout the material world. Humans\nwho cultivate their goodness merge with that larger universal\ngoodness. This brief metaphysically pregnant passage that links the\nheart-mind to attunement with the entire world comes to blossom in\nNeo-Confucian metaphysics (see entries on\n metaphysics in Chinese philosophy,\n Song-Ming Confucianism,\n Zhu Xi,\n and\n Wang Yangming).\n\nMengzi focuses most on compassion and its development into\nhuman-heartedness, the first duan. Of the four duan,\nshi/fei and its development into wisdom bears most directly\non the way that the heart-mind\u2019s reflection and reasoning foster\ngrowth of the sprout of compassion into human-heartedness and of the\nother two sprouts into their corresponding virtues. Accordingly, the\ndiscussion here will focus on the compassion/human-heartedness and\nshi/fei/wisdom. However, there is a growing body of\nliterature on the Confucian view of shame and a sense of shame as\nplaying important roles in the development of moral character,\ncontrary to some prominent views in the Western literature that shame\nis seldom, if ever, a productive moral emotion (see Van Norden 2002\n[2004]; Seok 2017; Tiwald 2017; and Hu 2022) for examples of\ndiscussion along these lines.\n\nMencius illustrates compassion with his story of the alarm, distress\nand compassion that anyone would feel upon seeing a child about to\nfall into a well (2A6). Clearly it starts with a cognitive\nrecognition of another as about to suffer. Alarm and distress are the\nnatural qing (emotion) in the situation and the compassion\nimplicit in that natural affection. In 2A6, Mengzi describes it as the\nheart that is unable to bear or endure [the suffering of] others. The\nqing also is an impulse to action\u2014to prevent or\nalleviate suffering. The impulse to action is the impulse to identify\nwhat should be done; thinking in conjunction with empirical knowledge\nof the world is required. Developing human-heartedness requires\nlearning to act on the emotion in the right way. In this, the sprout\nof shi/fei and its corresponding virtue of wisdom come into\nplay.\n\nMengzi does not engage in much explicit discussion of\nshi/fei, but the way that shi and fei are\nused in the text provide clues. Shi is often used to identify\n(\u201cthis\u201d) or to compare actions, events, or qualities of\npersons under certain categories (lei\u985e), and\nfei is used to exclude them (\u201cnot this\u201d) from\ncertain other categories. In 1A3, Mengzi explains to King Hui why\npeople are not flocking to his state despite the King\u2019s\nperception that he is more human-hearted toward his people than\nneighboring kings are to their peoples. Compare, he asks the king, a\nsoldier who throws down his weapon and flees from the enemy for one\nhundred paces to one who flees for fifty paces. Is not the second\nstill fleeing? The King agrees by saying that \u201cthis\u201d is\nalso fleeing. Mengzi then points out that the King lets dogs and swine\neat food meant for human beings while his people die of famine. The\nimplication is that the king\u2019s policies still fall far short of\nbeing human-hearted, even if metaphorically they go fifty paces less\nin the wrong direction. If the King attempts to excuse himself by\nsaying that it has simply been a bad year, Mengzi asks, \u201cHow is\n\u2018this\u2019 different from killing a person by stabbing him and\nthen saying, \u2018It was not I; it was the weapon\u2019?\u201d\nHere shi as \u201cthis\u201d is used to liken the\nking\u2019s inadequate efforts to save his people to the soldiers who\nstop at fifty paces and to a killer who blames the knife instead of\nhimself.\n\nMencius here draws on the analogical reasoning employed by the Mohists\ntalk of shi/fei as right/wrong. In another example, 2B3,\nMengzi is asked why he declined to accept money from King Xuan on one\noccasion and accepted on two subsequent occasions. Mengzi points to\nwhat he claims are relevant differences in the circumstances.\nDeclining was shi in the first case but it could be\nfei on subsequent occasions. Shi/fei is used in such\ncontexts to exemplify the relevance of wisdom to ethical excellence.\nThe fourth duan involves inborn dispositions to perceive or\njudge patterns of similarities and differences that play crucial roles\nin the cognitive aspects of the other duan, in recognizing\nmoral relevance. The duan develop into full moral virtues\nwith the growing guidance of the cognitive moral intuition.\nThe intuition identifies who is suffering and which acts are shameful,\nand which are not.\n\nAnalogical reasoning is pervasive in the Mengzi. In the most\ngeneral sense, analogical reasoning infers a conclusion in a\nproblematic case on the basis of that case\u2019s relevant\nsimilarities with another case in which the conclusion is regarded as\ncorrect. Has the King done enough for his starving people? Not if what\nhe has done is like the soldiers who stop fleeing from battle at 50\npaces. Is it the King\u2019s fault that the year\u2019s harvest has\nbeen a bad one? Yes, it is still his fault if his failure to prevent\nor make up for the bad harvest is like the killer who blames the knife\nand not himself. However, as the example in 2B3 illustrates, an\nanalogical inference may be defeated if a morally relevant\ndissimilarity is pointed out (see Lau 1970; Wong 2002).\n\nWhen the dispositions to deploy shi/fei develop into\nabilities to reliably discern patterns of a morally relevant sort,\nthey grow to constitute zhi as wisdom. Wisdom is implicitly\nethical. In 4A27, authentic wisdom is identified as knowing the most\nauthentic expression of ren (human-heartedness) as serving\none\u2019s parents and the most authentic expression of yi\n(righteousness) as following one\u2019s elder brothers. In 2A7 Mengzi\nsays that no one can cause us not to be ren\u2014failure in\nthis derives from a lack of wisdom. In 7A46 Mengzi says that what is\nurgent for the wise is confronting what is fundamental. There is no\none whom those who are ren do not love, but what is\nfundamental is earnestly caring for the worthy. Mengzi does\nnot make explicit what the meaning of \u201cmost fundamental\u201d\nis, but one possibility is that it is to be given priority in the\norder of development. One begins with concentrating most of\none\u2019s efforts to what is most fundamental and extends it to what\nis less fundamental.\n\nWisdom includes weighing conflicting values and judging correctly\nwhich takes precedence. In 4A17, when challenged by an example where\nthe situation seems to call for a violation of li (ritual\npropriety) by taking the hand of one\u2019s sister-in-law to save her\nfrom drowning, Mengzi replies that only a wolf would not save her.\nMengzi is then asked why he does not save the whole world when it is\ndrowning, the implication being that he refuses to sweep aside the\nniceties of ritual propriety to do what is necessary. He answers that\nit is a matter of discretion (quan \u6b0a) to determine\nthat saving one\u2019s sister-in-law takes precedence over ritual\npropriety, but he wonders whether he is being asked to save the world\nby pulling it out with his hand. One saves the world through the way,\nthe Dao \u9053, and the implication is that saving the\nworld with the dao cannot involve simply sweeping aside\nritual propriety.\n\nCrucial for Mengzi, then, is how the duan develop\ninto full virtues. Since analogy is the central method of reasoning\nfeatured in the text, we may conclude it is a major way innate knowing\ngrows into moral knowledge. The initial knowledge is sprouts of inborn\nmoral intuition. We start, e.g., from knowing to serve parents and\nfollowing elder brothers and infer who else to serve and to follow in\ndeveloping ren and yi (4A27 and 7A46).\n\nHowever, the central example in 2A6 of the operation of compassion is\none\u2019s emotional response to an endangered child who is neither\nin one\u2019s family nor known. But even if human beings are\nnaturally disposed to spontaneously care for their family members and\nfor innocent children who are not their own, they may not be disposed\nto spontaneously care for an irascible villager or for a stranger\nthey\u2019ve never met. To know that we have a reason to care for\nthese others, we must see the relevant moral similarities between them\nand the family member or child we do spontaneously care for. We infer\nwhat we have reason to do from cases in which we are confident that we\nknow what to do. These base cases for further inference by analogy are\nsupplied by intuitions from the duan.\n\nStill, such inferences are not valid if there are relevant moral\ndissimilarities between the base cases and the problematic cases at\nhand. This is an implication of 4A17, discussed above with reference\nto quan. Though one may not accord with the ritual of men and\nwomen not touching one another to save a drowning sister-in-law, one\nhas to save the drowning world through the Dao, and part of\nfollowing the Dao is to restore ritual propriety.\nMengzi\u2019s horizontal reasoning coming from comparing particular\ncases stands in significant contrast with vertical, top-down reasoning\nfrom general principles. It holds superior appeal if one thinks that\none\u2019s moral intuitions are more solid when rooted in the\nparticular, and it allows for building up to general principles\nthrough noting recurrent patterns of similarities and dissimilarities\n(Wong 2002). In 1A3, as seen above, Mengzi uses analogies to get King\nHui to see that he has to do more to keep his people from\nstarving.\n\nSince the duan include emotions, however, growth of the\nsprouts also depends on growth or maturation of the sprouts of\nemotion. Mengzi attempts to foster that maturation in King Xuan in\n1A7. King Xuan asks whether he has the capacity to be the kind of true\nking Mengzi has been urging him to be. Mengzi prompts the king to\nremember a time he spared an ox being led to ritual slaughter. The\nKing, moved by seeing the oxen\u2019s eyes, decides to spare the ox.\nBut he is uncertain about what his motivation was since, when asked\nwhether the ritual should be canceled, he orders a sheep to take the\nox\u2019s place. He is aware that his people surmise that he was\nbeing cheap (a sheep not being as costly).\n\nMengzi expresses understanding as to why sparing the ox but sending a\nsheep to be slaughtered confused the King, and his people, about his\nmotivation. However, he asserts that the King was rather moved by\ncompassion for the ox, and the King not only remembers being moved by\nthe ox\u2019s trembling in fear but also experiences the feeling of\ncompassion in his conversation with Mengzi. The King is prompted by\nMengzi\u2019s interpretation of his motivation to reflect back on the\nincident and recalls likening the ox to an innocent person being led\nto the execution ground. One implication of this very rich and complex\npassage is that Mengzi seems to be trying to spark the feeling of\ncompassion in the king and get that compassion to flow from the ox to\nhis people. That is why Mengzi immediately asks the King how his\nkindness could be sufficient to extend to animals but not to his\npeople. If it does not so extend, it is not because he is incapable,\nbut simply because he does not do it, thus implicitly answering the\nKing\u2019s original question of whether he could be a true king.\n\nNotice that Mengzi has again deployed an analogy here: from the\nox\u2019s suffering to the people\u2019s suffering and has appealed\nto the king\u2019s capability to respond to the ox to support the\ninference that he has the capability to care for his people. But what\nMengzi is most after is not the purely intellectual recognition that\nthe King has the capability. He has gotten the King to feel again the\ncompassion he felt with the ox, and by bringing up his people\u2019s\nplight, is trying to get the King\u2019s compassion to engage with\nhis people. That is, the most relevant analogy is from an emotion felt\nin one case to a hoped-for emotion in the second case. It is all the\nmore plausible because the King himself mediated his compassion for\nthe ox with the thought of an innocent person being led to execution.\nAnalogy plays a crucial role not only in extending intellectual assent\nbut also the affective motivation to act on that assent. Recognition\nof a reason to spare one\u2019s people suffering must be enlivened\nwith emotion to be motivationally effective.\n\nThere is more to be gleaned from this very rich and complex passage.\nIn his discussion with the King, Mengzi accepts the permissibility of\nsacrificing an animal for the performance of a ritual, but he also\naccepts that the King was right to spare the ox, having seen\nit\u2019s suffering. The underlying rationale may be that one\u2019s\nsensitivity to the suffering of animals is so close to one\u2019s\nsensitivity to the suffering of persons that it can be harmful to\nsquelch the former, even if the sacrifice would have been justified\nhad he not seen its suffering. The junzi \u541b\u5b50 or\n\u201cexemplary person\u201d (see Analects [1998]) cannot\nbear to see the suffering of animals, and so he stays away from the\nkitchen (there is disquieting silence here on the moral plight of\nthose in the kitchen; some people\u2019s moral sensitivities\napparently matter less than those of others). The constructive point\nto be taken here is that the sensitivity to other\u2019s suffering is\nsomething that must be both nurtured and protected. It cannot\nbe turned off simply because it is justifiable to kill the suffering\ncreature in question in one case. In other words, compassion as an\nemotional capacity has a course of development that is not malleable\nto being regulated by moral judgments that ignore the natural course\nof its development. In 1A7, Mengzi also mentions that deprivation of a\nconstant means of livelihood can entirely divert one\u2019s focus on\ndeveloping the sprouts to the urgent task of subsistence.\n\nThese views pertain to the kind of hierarchy Mengzi has in mind for\nthe relation between the heart-mind and the rest of the person. Recall\nthe close relation between emotions and the body. The heart-mind can\nseek to direct the flow of the qi of emotive attitudes, as\nMengzi attempts to coax King Xuan\u2019s compassion to flow from the\nox to his people, but the qi has natural tendencies that the\nheart-mind must respect. This point seems to be made in a more general\nway by the passage in 2A2 about the farmer from Song. The farmer was\nworried that his seedlings were not growing. He pulled on them,\nintending to help them grow, and his sons returned to the field to\nfind them all withered. There are few people, says Mengzi, who do not\ntry to help their seedlings to grow, but on the other hand there are\nsome who mistakenly believe that they can do no benefit to\ntheir seedlings and consequently neglect and do not weed among them.\nPerhaps the thought about the need to weed is connected to the thought\nin 6A15 that those who nurture the small part of the person become\nsmall persons. The weeds may be excessive desires for objects of the\nsenses, and weeding may be controlling these desires so that they do\nnot deprive the moral sprouts from nutrition. But further, it is\npossible to damage and even to kill the sprouts in trying to help them\ngrow. Underlying this implication is the belief that the inborn\nduan have a structure such that they grow in response to\ncertain kinds of treatment and wither in response to other kinds.\n\nMengzi\u2019s conception of the relation between the\nheart-mind\u2019s reflection and reasoning and its affective\ndispositions is not a simple hierarchical one. It is of an organic\nunity and mutual dependence. This conception presents a substantial\nand, in many respects, appealing alternative to Humean and Kantian\nconceptions of this relation. The heart-mind is not a slave to\nemotion, but neither does it act independently of emotion when it acts\nmorally (Wong 2017). Emotions go into the very composition of the\nduan of the heart-mind. Emotions have cognitive content\nembedded within them which shapes their intentional direction. For\nexample, the affective disposition identifies another\u2019s\npotential or actual suffering as a salient feature of the situation\nthat could constitute a reason and conative impetus for acting. On the\nother hand, the heart-mind\u2019s reflective and reasoning evaluation\nidentifies other relevant features of the situation as possible\nreasons that may augment or counteract suffering as a reason. For\nexample, in 1A7 (where King Xuan likens the ox\u2019s suffering to an\ninnocent person being led to the execution ground) and 3A5 (where\nMengzi associates the ancient kings\u2019 solicitous treatment of the\npeople as if they were innocent infants), Mengzi identifies a\nperson\u2019s innocence as relevant to having the compassionate\nresponse. This of course implies that the heart-mind might override an\nincipient compassionate response if the recipient is in some sense\ndeserving of suffering. Reflection, reasoning, and emotion are more\nlike partners in the human moral response to the world, rather than\none being dominant over the other, either descriptively or\nnormatively.\n2.5 The Zhuangzi\n\nThe Zhuangzi puts the focus back on the epistemic and\nnormative (guidance) functions of the heart-mind, i.e., Mencius heart\nof \u662f\u975e shi-fei (this-not that). This reconnects\nhim with the later Mohist\u2019s theory of the norms of language/name\nuse. But his style differs and is unique. He relates insights through\nvivid and often humorous stories and metaphorical imagery.\n\nThe Zhuangzi questions the very notion of a hierarchy with\nthe heart-mind leading the rest of the person (references are to\nZhuangzi in CTP). Zhuangzi advises listening to all the\nnatural parts of one\u2019s body, of which the heart-mind is only\none. This egalitarian conception of the parts of a person puts the\nheart-mind in conversation with the rest of the body rather than in\ncommand.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s theory of cognition and guidance receives its most\nsustained, varied, and intricate expression in the second chapter,\n\u201cEqualizing Assessments of Things\u201d (Qi Wu Lun\n\u9f4a\u7269\u8ad6). Its blend of illustrations of knowing and\nof mistaking ignorance for knowing challenges interpreters to reflect\non how his theory of mind works. The opening reflection by Ziqi\n\u5b50\u7da6 starts the analysis of the heart-mind regarding the\nbody. Seemingly deep in some meditative state, Ziqi describes it as\nhaving \u201clost myself\u201d. He further explains to his\ninterlocutor using the metaphor of pipes. We know of human pipes but\nhaven\u2019t known of the pipes of earth; We\u2019ve heard the pipes\nof earth, but not yet the pipes of Tian. The Great Clump\n(earth) blows its breath, its qi, through ten thousand\nnatural hollows. When blown lightly, it generates small harmony, and\nwhen powerful, a vast and grand harmony.\n\nSo, what then are the pipes of Tian? It blows out the 10\nthousand dissimilarities and makes them one\u2019s own, along with\none\u2019s own choosing, where does the impulse arise?\n(Zhuangzi CTP: Qi Wu Lun, 1 [trans. 2009: 9]).\nZhuangzi\u2019s obscure answer has provided fuel for many\ninterpreters\u2019 employment (see entry on\n Zhuangzi).\n\nThe combative moral arguments of humans start from their choosing\ndifferent ways of marking similarity and dissimilarity in language,\ne.g., with terms like \u7fa9 yi (rightness). We speak of\ngreat and small knowing, great and small ways of speaking and even\nargue in our sleep. Waking, our heart-minds go into battle with\nfeints, deception, threats. We \u201cshoot out\u201d \u662f\nshi\u2019s (this is right) and \u975e fei\u2019s\n(No, that is wrong) like arrows from a crossbow. Then we stick to them\nas if they were covenants, As the weight of commitments grows we slow,\nweaken, fade and lose our vitality as if we were \u201c[h]eld fast as\nif bound by cords\u201d, continuing \u201calong the same\nruts\u201d. \u201cThus, the heart-mind moves closer to death, and\nnothing can restore its vitality\u201d (Zhuangzi CTP: Qi\nWu Lun, 2 [trans. 2009: 9]). Presumably the insight Ziqi reports\nas \u201closing my \u2018I\u2019\u201d concerns the cognitive and\nnormative capacity. But it views the battles with heart-minds as if\nfrom a distance. Then, pointedly avoiding attributing them to the\norgan, it introduces feelings that arise.\n\n\nJoy and anger, sorrow and happiness, plans and regrets,\ntransformations and stagnations, unguarded abandonment and deliberate\nposturing\u2014music flows out of hollows, mushrooms form from steam!\nDay and night they alternate before us, but no one knows from whence\nthey sprout. Never mind! Merely notice that they are there day and\nnight\u2026they come from somewhere. Without them there would be no\n\u201cI\u201d, and without an \u201cI\u201d nothing chosen.\n(Qi Wu Lun, 3 [trans. 2009: 10]).\n\n\nThis Hume-like reflection about the source of the \u201cI\u201d\nsuggests it is not identified with the heart-mind. The body has\n\u201chundreds of bones, nine openings and six organs\u201d, is any\nof them more \u201cI\u201d than the others? The Zhuangzi\ngoes on to muse that there must be some controller or true lord even\nif we cannot identify it. Once put together, these parts depend on\neach other as we struggle through life which passes by at a gallop.\nWe\u2019re never sure of what we\u2019ve done or if we achieve\ngoals. As the body fades, the heart-mind fades with it. Sad!\n(Ibid)\n\n\nIf we follow whatever has so far taken shape, fully formed, in our\nheart-minds, making that our teacher, who could ever be without a\nteacher? \ufeffThe historical scholar knows the times and his\nheart-mind chooses by itself. The fool does so as well. To get\n\u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d before one\u2019s pass\nstructures someone\u2019s heart-mind \u2014that is like leaving for\nYue today and arriving yesterday. (Qi Wu Lun, 4 [trans.\nadapted from 2009: 11])\n\n\nThe heart-mind acquires its structure as it \u201cselects\u201d\n(qu \u53d6) among alternatives. This cheng xin\n\u6210\u5fc3, the fully-structured heart-mind then \u201cshoots\nout\u201d \u201cthis-right!\u201d and \u201cnot that-wrong!\u201d\nsuggests that the piping of human beings is formed on the basis of\nselecting from some this\u2019s and rejecting others. We\nacquire a conception of \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d\nfrom our past practice.\n\nThe passage goes on to say, \u201cCourses are formed by walking them.\nThings are so by being called so\u201d (Qi Wu Lun, 6 [trans.\n2009: 13]). The implication is that the heart-mind\u2019s\n\u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cthus and\nso\u201d and \u201cnot thus and so\u201d emerge within the relative\nspace or our lived worlds in which our structure was acquired by our\npast practice, our concepts of things with certain relations and\ndifferences from other things in our environment. Zhuangzi\u2019s\nview in the Qi Wu Lun is like Nelson Goodman (1978) and Iris\nEinheuser (2011). On this view, facts are not \u201cin the\nworld\u201d independently of how we conceptualize them. We carve out\nfacts from the stream of goings-on in our environment. An independent\nworld is responsible for this stream, and we systematize and structure\nit from the very small portion the world we have navigated in our time\nin that world.\n\nRecent neuroscience also fits within this Zhuangzian picture. It\nsuggests that we focus attention on only part of the overwhelming\namount of information we get from the world. We suppress conscious\nawareness of information that seems irrelevant to that focus.\n(Nakajima et al. 2019). This is how we can hear other people at our\ntable in a noisy restaurant. Once we have our concept scheme for the\nworld, we suppress alternative ways of naming (concept frameworks).\nThe natural world, independent of our concepts, does impact and\nconstrain the shape of that framework. Constellations of stars are a\nmetaphor for this process of selection. We may see a certain group of\nstars as forming a \u201cBig Dipper\u201d, but alternatively see\nthat group as part of a larger group forming a \u201cGreat\nBear\u201d, the dipper stars now forming a portion of the back half\nof the bear\u2019s torso and its tail. Such alternative parsings\ncannot produce just any range of facts. But we make the facts we make\nthrough the parsings.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s epistemology and theory of mind does not concern how\nwe represent mentally a fact that exists out in the natural world. It\nis of a scheme of navigation with concepts we project on the world to\naid us in getting about. Zhuangzi sees a similar orientation by all\nnatural creatures. They are equipped with faculties for getting on\nwith their lives. Our language-ing the world is broadly like\nbird\u2019s chirping. Both of us are seeking coherence with the\nstructure of the world in our own choices of ways to live.\n\nConstructive skepticism and substantial assertion about the world and\nhow we relate to it do not just sit side by side in this haunting\nimagery, but are intertwined. Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is\nconstructive because it does not compel us to give up on our\nconceptualization, but to recognize its overarching similarity to\nother creatures as well as other peoples with different\nlanguages\u2014systems of names. Thus, constructive skepticism is\ncompatible with substantive claims about the nature of the world as a\nwhole consisting in interdependent, fluidly interacting things that\nreact to and flow into a shared system. We become an ecosystem of\nrelated ways of life fitting this natural world. Each of us\nemerges from and returns to that greater whole, a living monism with\nreal parts. Indeed, the complexity and fluid plasticity of things is\npart of what makes the range of alternative conceptualizations of the\nworld significant and wide. The significance of this way of all being\n\u201cOne\u201d is that the world can be expected to be elusive.\n\nThe Zhuangzi expresses a keen appreciation for the\nvariability of language and conceptualization across persons and\ncommunities. People differ in the inferences that link the terms\nostensibly shared in their language. This often results in their\ntalking past each other, as is the case with the Mohists and the\nConfucians. Each shi\u2019s (affirms) what the other\nfei\u2019s (negates) and negates what the other affirms\n(Qi Wu Lun, 4). Mohists, for example, will fei\nritual practice that puts resources and human energy into rituals of\nmourning and burial that could have gone into fulfilling the needs of\nthe living, and Confucians will shi ritual practice that\nexpresses reverence and gratitude toward the deceased as cultivating\nimportant emotional dispositions of deference, yielding and gratitude\ntoward others. Mohist bring coherence into their inference relations\namong terms by making benefit and harm (li hai\n\u5229\u5bb3) central to normative conceptual scheme. Confucians\nwill bring coherence to their inferences focusing on family relations\nand fidelity to past usage and practice, deference and ritual (li\nrang \u79ae\u8b93). The mere fact that both have emerged in\nPre-Han China does not, by itself, require either side to abandon its\nscheme. But it does require that we be more modest about our own\nconstructions, even as we use them. We should recognize that our\nreasons for them are themselves derived from the scheme constructed in\nour heart-minds by past practice and exposure. We are well advised to\nbe open to how others construct their worlds and seek understanding of\nhow the others\u2019 scheme works in their way of life rather than\nwarring with or coercing them to follow what we \u201cknow\u201d in\nour way of life. \u201c\u2026 if you want to affirm what they\nnegate and negate what they affirm, nothing compares with using the\nlight (yi ming \u4ee5\u660e)\u201d (Qi Wu Lun,\n4). What does it mean to use the light?\n\nThe Zhuangzi is often interpreted as holding that there is a\nway of knowing that is not subject to skeptical doubt. This way may be\na kind of knowing-how different in kind from propositional knowledge\n(e.g., see Ivanhoe 1993; Eno 1996), or it may be a kind of mystical,\nineffable insight into the nature of things or their oneness (e.g.,\nRoth 2003). The skepticism, on this interpretation, is limited to\nskepticism about words, argument, and discursive theory (for detailed\ncriticism of these interpretations, see Chiu 2018). Given the\nelusiveness of the language in the text, it is not surprising that it\nis hard to definitively rule out the presence of a voice that speaks\nfor ineffable, unmediated access to the world as it is. The skill\npassages, however, require no such interpretation. They often\nemphasize that the skill is largely independent of language and admit\nto an inability to teach the skill to others.\n\nA modest constructive skepticism takes care not to overgeneralize\nskepticism itself. It does not require ruling out skills or\nrealization of our oneness with the world. It is, in fact, the\nlaunching point of this theory of a mind that copes with reality as it\nfinds it. The value of Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is its combination\nof cultivating one\u2019s way of structuring by appreciating\n(shedding light on) other possibilities found in nature and\nother human views. We are open to other voices in finding ways to live\ntogether in a natural unity, but also open to the limitations of these\nother voices. No performative author (including tian) makes\none of these lives required. They are real world, practical options.\nWe, the audience, are left to make up our minds, as would be in the\nspirit of constructive skepticism!\n\nMoreover, Zhuangzi even hesitates to definitively affirm ways of\nliving (if that means not dying).\n\n\n\ufeffHow, then, do I know that delighting in life is not a\ndelusion? How do I know that in hating death I am not like an orphan\nwho left home in youth and no longer knows the way back? (Qi Wu\nLun, 12 [trans. 2009: 19])\n\n\nAnd later,\n\n\n\ufeffWhile dreaming you don\u2019t know it\u2019s a dream. You\nmight even interpret a dream in your dream\u2014and then you wake up\nand realize it was all a dream. \ufeffPerhaps a great awakening\nwould reveal all of this to be a vast dream. (Qi Wu Lun, 12\n[trans. 2009: 19])\n\n\nConsider perception. In the opening story of the first chapter,\n\u201cFree and Easy Wandering\u201d (Xiao Yao You\n\u900d\u9059\u904a) we encounter an enormous bird named Peng\nflying 90,000 miles up. Is \u201cthe blue on blue\u201d of the sky\nis its true color or is it the distance that makes it look that way\n(Xiao Yao You, 1). When Peng looks down, he sees only this\nearth. We, looking around on earth, see much more detail. Smaller\ncreatures, a cicada and fledgling dove, who struggle to make it from\nthe sandalwood to the elm tree, and they wonder what Peng up to 90,000\nmiles in the air and head south for. These creatures illustrate that\ntheir size and powers determine their Umwelten\u2014the\nworlds of their aspirations and ways of guiding their behavior (von\nUexk\u00fcll 2010). Each kind of organism lives in a world shaped by\ntheir distinctive capacities. Each organism \u201cselects\u201d from\nthe plethora of possibilities in the world, the possible paths to its\nfuture given its size, powers and needs (see Cantor 2020 for a similar\ntake on the \u201cHappy Fish\u201d story in chapter 17,\n\u201cAutumn Floods\u201d Qiushui \u79cb\u6c34\nchapter).\n\nDifferent creatures \u201cfit\u201d their environment in different\nways. People eschew sleeping in damp places, unlike eels. People fear\nliving in trees, unlike monkeys. Which of these creatures\n\u201cknows\u201d the right place to live? Different creatures want\nto eat different things. Each is attracted to creatures of their own\nkind and not to other kinds. The passage concludes,\n\n\nFrom where I see it, the transitions of Humanity and Responsibility\nand the trails of right and wrong are hopelessly tangled and confused.\nHow could I know how to distinguish which is right among them? (Qi\nWu Lun, 11 [trans. 2009: 18])\n\n\nIf the point of these observations about various animals were a fairly\nsimple relativism to the effect that each picks out the features of\nthe environment that is the most relevant to their size, needs, and\npowers, there need be no skeptical thrust. Differences in what is\nright for each type of creature need not pose problems for the\nprospects of gaining knowledge. Yet the passage ends with the\ndeclaration that the trails of right and wrong are hopelessly tangled\nand confused. The point instead is that different animals are\ninevitably partial in selecting the features of the environment that\nare the most suitable given their size, needs, and powers. The\nUmwelt of an animal is likely to leave out features of the\nworld that are not so relevant to its needs, and maybe some features\nare out of reach entirely from the creature\u2019s powers of\nunderstanding and perception.\n\nRight before this relativist passage, Nie Que asked Wang Ni if he\nknows what all creatures agree on affirming. He demurs \u201chow\nwould I know that!\u201d \u201cdo you knows what you do not\nknow?\u201d Same answer (Qi Wu Lun, 11). This illustrates\nthat the sort of skepticism in play here. It is not a complete denial\nof knowing that dooms any attempt at discovery. Modest, constructive\nskepticism encourages discovery. In the first chapter, Zhuangzi\nchastises Huizi for being unimaginative in using a huge gourd. Why had\nhe not thought of making it into a boat? That Huizi stopped trying to\nfind a use for an unconventionally large gourd because he only had\nconventional uses for it in his mind meant that he still had a lot of\ntangled weeds clogging up his mind (Xiao Yao You, 6 [trans:\nZiporyn 2009: 7).\n\nThe tone of skepticism here arises from our treating conventional\nknowledge as final. This skeptical stance is constructive in two ways.\nFirst, the prospect of overturning received ideas is greeted with\ndelight. We can do this by learning to take the perspectives of\nothers, human and non-human.\n\nLearning is using one\u2019s capacities to increase know-how. An\nessential part of learning is practice. When the dao of our\ninner parts, our li, is coherent with a dao in our\nenvironment, we can achieve extraordinary skills. Skill learning\ninvolves the entire body. Such sublime exercise is described with\nZhuangzi\u2019s usual skill with words in \u201cThe Primacy of\nNurturing Life\u201d (Yangsheng zhu\n\u990a\u751f\u4e3b) chapter. Zhuangzi describes the coordination\nof his hand, foot, shoulder, and knee as he carved the ox\u2014like\nperforming an elegant dance\u2014even the sounds of the cutting,\nflopping, ripping were like the musical accompaniment. The artist,\nCook Ding, replies to a ruler\u2019s praise of his elegant dance-like\nbutchering, that what he values is dao through which his\nskill advances. When he first began butchering, he saw only the oxen.\nAfter three years, he never again saw the ox as whole. Now his\n\u201cspirit\u201d (shen \u795e) guides rather than his\neyes depending on natural lines (Tianli \u5929\u7406)\ndividing its joints and spaces (Yang Sheng Zhu, 2).\n\nThree years of practice led to a changing conception of his\nperformance as a natural way through the path structure in the ox. He\nno longer self-consciously performs the constituent behaviors, but\nfocuses on the dao and li of his movements and the\nenvironment. He is totally absorbed and yet performs in relaxed joyous\nease. His body knows the way; no Cartesian pilot in the head directs\nit.\n\nRecent work on human embodied activity reflects Zhuangzi\u2019s\ndescription of elevated skills. Sean Gallagher (2005) has written\nabout the way embodiment of know-how shapes our \u201cbody\nschemas\u201d, the sensory-motor capacities that give us a sense of\nour bodies in space. When we close our eyes and raise an arm, our body\nschemas enable us to know exactly where our arm is located. Our body\nschemas become engaged with the environment to help us accomplish our\ntask. When we get good at using these available things as tools, they\nin effect become part of our body schemas, at least in that context\n(see also Barrett 2011: 200).\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s reflections on this kind of knowing invariably\nincludes notice of its defects and limitations. The modest skepticism\nthat motivates being open to further advancing know-how remains for\nCook Ding. When he comes to a difficult spot in the ox, he pauses and\nfocuses, looking carefully at the point of difficulty, and carefully,\ncautiously, goes at cutting the knot. The experiential immersion in a\nlearned behavior never reaches absolute or total perfection, the flow,\nno matter how advanced, always possible to improve or achieve with\ngreater ease and satisfaction.\n\nFurther, even great skill may not amount to an ability to teach\nothers. The wheelwright of the \u201cHeaven\u2019s Way\u201d\n(Tian Dao\u5929\u9053) chapter says he cannot pass onto\nhis son the right way to chisel a wheel, and likens his situation to\nthe ancients who left their words in texts but not what they\naccomplished and how\u2014know-how that died with them (Tian\nDao, 9).\n\nHumans learn complex patterns of motor responses involved in playing\nmusical instruments and driving cars, in which the acquired knowledge\nis not fully accessible to discursive awareness (Clegg, DiGirolamo,\n& Keele 1998), and much of the way we learn language, especially\nthe first language, is natural programming. (Cleeremens, Destrebecqz,\n& Boyer 1998; Reber 1967, 1989). When intuitive know-how or\nability is unconsciously learned, conscious monitoring of performance\ncan be a matter of degree. Learning skilled motor responses involve\nbeing guided by kinesthetic feelings\u2014e.g., walking on two feet.\nKnowing how to ride a bicycle is notoriously persistent as\n\u201csecond nature\u201d. The same applies to navigating the\ninternet, playing an instrument, reading the emotions and body\nlanguage of others (Rosenthal et al. 1979; Edwards: 1998; Lewicki\n1986), or, as Zhuangzi notes, Hui Shi\u2019s philosophical\nreflections (Qi Wu Lun 7). Propositional knowledge is easily\nexplained as activation of an acquired capacity to formulate an answer\nto a question with \u201ckinesthetic\u201d sense of confidence in\nour performance. (Cohen et al. 1990; Dimitrovsky 1964; Rosenthal et\nal. 1979)\n\nZhuangzi links his theory of how learning cheng (shapes) the\nbody and heart-mind and what he calls \u201cfasting the\nheart-mind\u201d (Ren Jian Shi 1). The text advises Yan Hui\nto fast (zhai \u9f4b) his heart-mind in advising a violent\nruler. In interacting with him, Yan must listen with the heart-mind\nrather than with the ears, but not just with the heart-mind but\nlistening with his bodily qi:\n\n\nFor the ears are halted at what they hear. The [heart-]mind is halted\nat whatever verifies its preconceptions. But the vital energy is an\nemptiness, a waiting for the presence of beings. (Ren jian\nshi, 2 [trans. adapted from 2009: 26])\n\n\nOne may have a strategy, but its implementation must respond to the\nwhole situation.\n\nHaving the heart-mind involved the way it was in learning after the\nperformance has become bodily, second-nature motor memory, may\nactually impinge on performance flow. (Lieberman 2000: 121; McDonald\n& White 1993; Packard et al. 1989; Rauch et al. 1995; Fletcher et\nal. 2005). Thus, the relation between heart-mind\u2019s engaging in\nlearning and intuitive flow and bodily performance is complex. Thought\nfocused on method can also take over when intuitive performance hits a\nproblematic spot, as in Cook Ding\u2019s difficult spot in the ox. At\nother times, it can be better to suspend the heart-mind\u2019s\njudging in favor of sensitive responsive processing because the two\ncan interfere with one another. If there is sometimes competition\nbetween the disciplined learning and practice and the immediate\nprocessing of the complexities of a situation of performance,\nZhuangzi encourages fasting the heart-mind and\nresponding with one\u2019s whole qi.\n\nZhuangzi thus rejects Mencius\u2019 hierarchical conception\nof the person with the heart-mind in control of all behavior. The\nwhole body works together, and the role of the heart-mind may fit (as\nin learning and practice) or distract. When Confucius advises Yan Hui\nto fast his mind it is in the context of his going into a dangerously\ncomplex environment which demands totally alert focus on minute\ndetails of the situation. Moral lecturing and strategic manipulation\nof the ruler may have a counter-productive effect. More fundamentally,\nthe appeal is to the deliberative mind to recognize how elusive the\ncomplex and changing world is, and to take seriously the possibility\nthat it is tapping into just a sliver of the information coming in\nfrom that world.\n\nSome link Zhuangzi\u2019s \u201cfasting the heart-mind\u201d to\nmeditation. Certain forms of meditation may increase one\u2019s\ncapacity for attentiveness to features of the present situation,\nincluding cues as what others are thinking and feeling. There is some\nevidence that it increases attentional focus and cognitive\nflexibility. (Cahn & Polich 2006; Davidson et al. 2003; Moore\n& Malinowski 2009; Moore et al. 2012; Siegel 2007; but see\nHartkamp & Thornton 2017 for a negative result). \u201cBe\ncognitively flexible\u201d is in part the message of the stories of\nHuizi\u2019s gourds and the trainer\u2019s alternative offer of\nchestnuts to his monkeys, and the heart-mind might be able to learn it\nthrough meditation. Chan Buddhism or Zen has a complex theory of this\nwhich some link to fasting the mind.\n\nThis distinction between the conscious deliberative heart-mind as such\nand the heart-mind that is rigidly committed to certain\nconceptualizations of the world is used by advocates of combining\nConfucian with Daoist approaches to decision-making and epistemic\ninquiry. They see the Zhuangzi as affirming or approving of\nconscious deliberation as a learned process. When Confucius presents\nYan Hui with a dao or way of \u201cfasting the\nheart-mind\u201d, they engage in conscious, deliberative discussion\ngoverned by training-induced pathways in their brains.\n\nWhen Cook Ding employs caution upon encountering a complicated place\nin the ox, his conscious, deliberative heart-mind is taking over\ncontrol from the first-order heart-mind. Zhuangzi\u2019s\nadvice on the organs taking turns in guiding the body, operates on a\nmeta or second-order level. It is advice about how to prepare oneself\nto make quick, selectively precise and perceptively sensitive\ndecisions on a first-order level (Kahneman 2011). The training takes\nplace on the second level, the deliberative, cognitive level. One may\nbe advised to turn off the second-level, meta-dao in a\nreal-time. If you can\u2019t recognize an ox when you see one, you\nwon\u2019t recognize the words we used in teaching you a dao\nfor butchering one. Thus, Cook Ding underwent three years of study and\npractice after which he didn\u2019t have to rehearse his lessons to\ndistinguish and divide the thigh joint from the femur. He saw the\nanimal as a composition of its natural parts. He goes about carving at\nthe first level.\n\nA later Confucian, Wang Yangming (1472\u20131529 see entry on\n Wang Yangming)\n influenced by Daoist theory, argued that we go about learning to do\nsecond order deliberation at a first order level. We are, that is,\nnatural learners. Cook Ding went about learning to carve, but now\nhe\u2019s learning to practice in a different context, the\nking\u2019s palace. He learned a dao of carving an ox as Hui\nShi learned his discursive deliberative, deliberative, rhetorical\nteaching style. Both gradually came to shift from deliberate learning\nthrough practice to fast, first-order responsiveness.\n\nLater Chinese inheritors of the Laozi and the\nZhuangzi would as enthusiastically embrace teach and learning\nlogic and scientific method. Yan Fu (1854\u20131921) saw science and\nlogic as a dao of learning about natural dao.\nMetaphorically, he treated evolution as our natural dao.\nSimilarly, Jin Yuelin (1895\u20131984) taught mathematical logic at\nTsing Hua university modernized Zhuangzi\u2019s Daoism.\nNothing in Zhuangzi\u2019s conception of naturalism rules out being\ntrained in a dao of logic to use in guiding first-order\ndeliberative, discursive interactions with others.\n2.6 The Xunzi\n\nThe Xunzi (references to the Chinese text will be to\nXunzi in CTP) is named after Xun Kuang (\u8340\u6cc1, c.\n310\u2013c. 220 BCE). It further develops the Confucian tradition of\nappealing to authority of a leader to conceptualize the role of the\nheart-mind. Xunzi was a synthetic thinker, and his work shows\ninfluence from and response to the Mohists, the Daoists, Zhuangzi in\nparticular, and Mengzi who becomes a foil in chapter 23\n\u201cXing E\u201d (Human nature is bad). Xunzi takes\nConfucius teaching about the role of ritual and music in moral\ncultivation more seriously than does Mengzi\u2019s focus on innate\nmoral knowledge.\n\nIn the \u201cCorrect Naming\u201d (Zheng Ming\n\u6b63\u540d) chapter, Xunzi identifies what emerges in our lives\nas our nature (xing \u6027). This nature includes our\ncapacity to register sense distinctions accessed in the real world\nthrough the five sensory faculties. Our nature also includes liking,\ndisliking, happiness, anger, sadness and joy which we call\n\u201cdispositions\u201d (qing \u60c5). The qing\nreacts to events in the world and the heart-mind deems what is\npermissible or impermissible to seek through deliberating (lv\n\u616e). When the heart reflects and one\u2019s abilities act on\nit, this is called \u201cdeliberate effort\u201d (\u507d\nwei).\n\n\nThat which comes into being through accumulated reflection and\ntraining of one\u2019s abilities is also called \u201cdeliberate\neffort\u201d. (Xunzi 22.2 [trans. 2014: 236])\n\n\nSocial things and activities are measured by utility, and behavior\n(\u884c xing walking) is measured by morality. That by\nwhich people understand things is called \u201cthe\nunderstanding\u201d (zhi \u77e5), and when the\nunderstanding connects to things it is called \u201cknowledge\u201d\n(zhi \u667a). The ability to do things is called\n\u201cability\u201d (neng \u80fd) . To do things well, we\ncorrectly sort parts of the world into named categories according to\ntheir similarities and differences. Xunzi shares with the Mozi and the\nDaoists a conception of knowledge as practical know-how.\n\nTo correctly sort things, one must use the names for them consistently\nand with clarity:\n\n\nIf the names and their corresponding objects are tied together in a\nconfused fashion, then the distinction between noble and base will not\nbe clear, and the like and the unlike will not be differentiated\n\u2026 Thus, the wise person draws differences and establishes names\nin order to point out their corresponding objects. Most importantly,\nhe makes clear the distinction between noble and base, and more\ngenerally, he distinguishes the like and the unlike. (Xunzi\n22.4 [trans. 2014: 237])\n\n\nTo explain how one achieves comprehensive clarity, Xunzi draws from\nZhuangzi\u2019s account of the \u60c5 qing as the basis of\nchoosing. Xunzi adopts the concept of emptiness (xu \u865b)\nto talk about being receptive to impressions and keeping memories of\nearlier learning from interfering with this receptivity. He similarly\nadapts Daoist unity (yi \u58f9) as bringing all one\u2019s\ndiverse impressions into a harmonious whole in which none obscure\nothers; Daoist tranquility (jing \u975c) is remaining calm and\nalert, not swept away by the plethora of thoughts and perceptions,\nstimulation or even \u201cirritation\u201d (characterizations of the\nthree concepts from Stalnaker 2003: 90\u201391; see Xunzi\nCTP: 21.8 [trans. 2014: 228]).\n\nWhat Xunzi omits from Zhuangzi, however, is the idea that bodily\nqi plays a crucial role in providing avenues to the\nworld\u2019s structure that plug into the deliberating heart-mind.\nXunzi recommends the three states of heart-mind to equip it in picking\nout, sorting, and systematizing. Xunzi is also less open than Zhuangzi\nto the possibilities of alternate conceptualizations of the\nenvironment for behavior. He takes for granted that there are just the\nsimilarities and differences in things that our concepts register.\nSorting them correctly just is using the established, conventional\nnames correctly. Direct realism must not be confused with\nXunzi\u2019s doctrine.\n\nNames are conventionally established to stand for object types. With\nthem, we can communicate with distant peoples. There is no inherent\nproperty of a name that suits it to be the name of what is\nconventionally established to be its referent. Once established,\nhowever, there must not be competing accounts of its referent until it\nis disestablished (e.g., by a \u201cLater King\u201d) in favor of\nanother, purportedly better, name for common use in picking out a\nnatural kind.\n\nIn the \u201cDiscourse on Heaven\u201d chapter (Xunzi CTP\n17.4: Tian Lun \u5929\u8ad6 [trans. 2014: 176]),\nTian is said to give human beings their inborn dispositions,\nthe sensory faculties, and the heart-mind for controlling these\nfaculties to act as their lord. In the \u201cUndoing Fixation\u201d\nchapter (Jie Bi \u89e3\u853d) the heart-mind is said to\nbe the lord (jun \u541b) of the body, to be the one to\nissue orders but taking orders from no other part (Xunzi 21.9\n[trans. 2014: 229]). The next chapter \u201cCorrect Naming\u201d\ngoes on to say, however, that\n\n\nDeeming something permissible and guiding one are what the\nunderstanding must provide. Thus, even were one a gatekeeper, the\ndesires cannot be eliminated, because they are the necessary equipment\nof the nature. Even if one were the Son of Heaven, one\u2019s desires\ncannot be completely satisfied. Even though the desires cannot be\ncompletely satisfied, one can get close to complete satisfaction. Even\nthough desires cannot be eliminated, one\u2019s seeking can be\nregulated. Even though what is desired cannot be completely obtained,\nthe seeker can approach complete fulfillment. Even though desires\ncannot be eliminated, when what is sought is not obtained, one who is\nreflective desires to regulate his seeking. When the Way advances,\nthen one approaches complete fulfillment. (Xunzi CTP: 22.15\n[trans. adapted from 2014: 244]).\n\n\nThe import of this passage seems to be that Xunzi\u2019s way brings\nthe society of seekers close to fulfilling desire by regulating\nseeking, not, as Laozi had suggested, by forgetting desires\nalong with names. The understanding takes satisfaction of desire as\nthe basis for social regulation of seeking behavior with the aim of\nmaximizing satisfaction of desire.\n\nXunzi\u2019s normative development of this picture of human nature,\ndesire, and government compares to Mill\u2019s classification of\npleasures. His \u201cheavy\u201d vs. \u201clight\u201d are like\nMill\u2019s \u201chigher and lower\u201d pleasures\u2014metaphors\nfor making good judgments about superior versus inferior desire\nsatisfactions. One problem posed by the text is how Xunzi can validate\nthis classification on the naturalistic grounds with which he started\nhis account of the hear-mind, feelings, and pleasure so it does not\nlook like arbitrary declaration from the \u201cregulator of\nseeking\u201d.\n\nHis most notorious chapter \u201c[Human] Nature is Bad\u201d\n(Xunzi 23 Xing E \u6027\u60e1) seems an attempt\nto derive the ranking from natural assumptions. Human nature is bad,\nhe says, and goodness is a result of deliberate effort. People are\nborn with a fondness for benefit, and if they follow along with this,\nstruggle and contention arise. This inference seems to presuppose\npsychological egoism and Xunzi would be alone among the Classical\nmasters in taking selfishness to be natural. That interpretation,\nhowever, is controversial. Others find greater continuity with Mengzi\nthan the title slogan suggests.\n\nHowever, he goes on to list inborn feelings of envy and dislike and\nsight and sound \u201cdesires\u201d. The former lead to cruelty and\nvillainy and the latter to licentiousness. It is only through\ntransforming nature using teachers and models daoing ritual\nand traditional mores (yi), that human beings can be shaped\nto be yielding and deferent to proper order and end up becoming\ncontrolled. Rituals (and traditional music) and yi (ritual\nmores) generated by the sage kings are the only ones suited for the\ntask of reshaping human beings to be compliant and deferent to proper\nauthority and order. This is the context for making sense of\nXunzi\u2019s striking crafts metaphor: reshaping natural dispositions\nis like steaming and straightening crooked wood on the shaping frame,\nor honing and grinding blunt metal until it becomes sharp (CTP: 23.2\n[trans. 2014: 248]). Thus, morality is not part of\nTian\u2019s order, but something set up by the sage-kings to\ncorrect what is dangerous and unruly in people\u2019s nature.\n\nThe heart-mind does not have the power to reshape natural desires and\nemotions simply through its command. Xunzi consistently stresses the\nneed for unrelenting \u201cdeliberate effort\u201d to reshape and\nbeautify people\u2019s motivational system and character. In fact, in\none famous passage, he says that the exemplary person\n\n\nrepeatedly recites his learning in order to master it (beauty),\nponders it in order to comprehend it, makes his person so as to dwell\nin it, and eliminates things harmful to it in order to nourish it. He\nmakes his eyes not want to see what is not this, makes his\nears not want to hear what is not this, makes his mouth not\nwant to speak what is not this, and makes his heart not want\nto contemplate what is not \ufeffthis. He comes to the\npoint where he loves it, and then his eyes love it more than the five\ncolors, his ears love it more than the five tones, his mouth loves it\nmore than the five flavors, and his heart considers it more beneficial\nthan having the whole empire. (Quan Xue \u52f8\u5b78 CTP:\n1.18 [trans. 2014: 18])\n\n\nIf this passages about finding far greater satisfaction and peace of\nmind in performing actions on behalf of a beauty ideal and not for the\nsake of the self is put alongside the selfish characterization of\nhuman nature, the question immediately arises how one starts with a\nnature like that and ends up in a startlingly different place. Merely\ncoming to realize the benefits to self-interest in cooperation rather\nthan conflict would be insufficient for explaining how this\ntransformation could come about (Wong 1996, 2000). Sheer persistent\neffort does not explain how interests in the self can become\ninterests in the welfare of others for their own sake.\n\nIt may be that the only plausible alternative for Xunzi to work out\nhis theory is to admit that among the inborn dispositions there is at\nleast latent and incipient interest in others as well as the\nself-concerned interests highlighted in the famous passage from the\n\u201cHuman Nature is Bad\u201d chapter. There are passages in the\ntext that seem to make this concession. In the chapter\n\u201cDiscourse on Ritual\u201d (Li Lun \u79ae\u8ad6),\nXunzi says that\n\n\nAmong all the living things between Heaven and Earth, those that have\nblood and qi are sure to have awareness, \ufeffand of those\nthat have awareness, none fails to love its own kind.\n\n\nHe gives as examples birds or beasts who become separated from their\ngroups, grow distressed, and who seek to rejoin them. Xunzi concludes\nby saying that\n\n\namong creatures that have blood and qi, none has greater\nawareness than man, and so man\u2019s feeling for his parents knows\nno limit until the day they die. (CTP: 19.26 [trans. 2014: 213]).\n\n\nThat Xunzi identifies a disposition which humans and other animals\nshare implies that it is natural. How is this consistent with\nXunzi\u2019s saying that human nature is bad? People\u2019s nature\ncan still be called bad if the self-concerned, envious and hateful\ndispositions become dominant when they get no education in\nritual and mores or when education fosters dominance of selfishness.\nHuman beings in their nature can be nurtured to behave on powerful\nimpulses that get them into endemic, destructive conflict. Human\nnature is mixed and conflicted. Absent an environment that nurtures\ncontrol of the impulses that lead to conflict, people show their worse\nsides.\n\nThus, while Xunzi appeared to postulate a strong hierarchy of the\nheart-mind over the rest of the person, the way he fills out the\npicture suggests that the heart-mind attends to the total system of\ndesires and daos a strategy for the greatest satisfaction of\nthis total. This impression is supported by the language of\n\u201cnurturing\u201d (yang \u990a) the desires arising\nfrom the natural dispositions. He concludes that rituals and rightness\nmake it possible for humans to constrain seeking behavior by dividing\nthings and ranks so that seeking never exhausts nor depletes material\ngoods (Li Lun \u79ae\u8ad6 CTP 19.1).\n\nXunzi\u2019s conception of a mixed human nature and reliance on\nsocial nurturing to reshape the natural mix brings him into sharp\ndisagreement with Mengzi about the goodness of human nature. He argues\nthat Mengzi did not distinguish nature from what, with deliberate\neffort is nurtured:\n\n\nWhat is in people\u2019s nature is not learned and cannot be worked\nat. Those things they learn and achieve through working at them are\ntheir deliberate effort. (Xing E \u6027\u60e1; CTP 23.9\n[trans. 2014: 249])\n\n\nThis sharp dichotomy rejects Mengzi\u2019s metaphor of natural\nsprouts growing into morality, benevolence and wisdom. Xunzi treats\nmoral intuition on the analogy of the natural acuity of the senses. It\nis not something that can be learned or worked at:\n\n\n\ufeffpeople\u2019s nature is such that their eyes can see, and\ntheir ears can hear. The brightness by which they see does not depart\nfrom their eyes, and the acuity by which they hear does not depart\nfrom their ears. Their eyes are simply bright, and their ears are\nsimply acute. One does not learn this brightness. (Xing E\n\u6027\u60e1; CTP: 23.4 [trans. 2014: 249])\n\n\nScientific inquiry has not been kind to this particular view of\nXunzi\u2019s, and it relates to what he does not take from Laozi and\nZhuangzi. Scientists have discovered that perception is both bottom-up\nand top-down. We receive sensory input, but the mind fills in gaps\n(e.g., the famous \u201cblind spot\u201d to preserve awareness of a\nworld as we \u201cknow\u201d it. Our conceptual scheme exerts a\ntop-down organization of the sensory input. Some of the\nclassifications we get are inborn, but most are learned from infancy\npartly from our culture and from our exploring our environment, seeing\nwhich of our guesses as to what is bringing sensory input to us are\ncorrect. Acuity of perception in Xunzi\u2019s terms, the range of\ndistinctions our senses can distinguish may be something given to us\nby Tian but the world we see is profoundly influenced by\ntop-down processes.\n\nZhuangzi can retort that different systems of names can result in\ndifferently populated and structured worlds. Contemporary conclusions\nabout the relation between nature and nurture may support\nMengzi\u2019s conception of the inborn capacity as like a sprout that\ndevelops under the right environment conditions as well as\nXunzi\u2019s emphasis on nurture. But Mengzi is also vulnerable to\nZhuangzi\u2019s insight that nurture can take nature in many\ndifferent directions, so it becomes daunting to try to sort\ntian (nature) from ren (human social nurturing).\n\nXunzi\u2019s theory of reasoning and reflection vs. emotion and\ndesire is also different from Mengzi\u2019s. However, the differences\nare nuanced and his position closer to Mengzi\u2019s than the\ntwenty-third chapter title (\u201cHuman nature is bad\u201d) would\nsuggest. Clearly, the heart-mind has a supervisory role. It determines\nwhat behaviors best promote optimal fulfillment of natural desires.\nHis language of nurturing the capacity to resist seeking satisfaction\nof certain desires, stresses the wise and foresighted desires of the\nperson. The supervisory role is ultimately geared toward the good of\nthe whole person, as is Mengzi\u2019s. The heart-mind\u2019s\neffective supervising entails paying attention to the direction and\nrhythms of our emotional life, e.g., our responses the death of a\nloved one. When the heart-mind is sensitive to the overall pattern, it\ncan select how to channel seeking behavior to achieve personal and\nsocial harmony.\n",
