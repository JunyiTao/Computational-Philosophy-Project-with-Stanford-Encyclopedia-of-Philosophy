    "main_text": "Themes in feminist ethics || Gender binarism, essentialism, and separatism\n2.1 Gender binarism, essentialism, and separatism\n\nGender binarism, which is the view that there are only two\ngenders\u2014male and female\u2014and that everyone is only one of\nthem (Dea 2016a, 108), is assumed by most feminist ethicists in the\n1970s and 1980s (Jaggar 1974; Daly 1979). Some of these feminists\ncriticize male supremacy without thereby preferring female supremacy\n(Frye 1983; Card 1986; Hoagland 1988). They argue that although the\ncategories of \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d are\nphysiologically distinct, the potential of feminism to liberate both\nmen and women from oppressive gendered social arrangements suggests\nthat men and women do not have different moralities or separate\nrealities, and that we do not need to articulate separate capacities\nfor ethics (Jaggar 1974; Davion 1998).\n\nOther feminist ethicists offer radically different views. Mary Daly,\nfor example, argues in Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical\nFeminism that women were traditionally defined throughout\nintellectual history as being subversive of rationality, impartiality,\nand morality as traditionally conceived. Daly argues that women ought\nto embrace, as essential to women\u2019s natures and good, some of\nthe very qualities that she says men have ascribed to women as\nessential to women\u2019s natures and bad. Daly suggests valuing both\nwomen\u2019s capacities for childbearing and birth (as opposed to\ncapacities to engage in war and killing) and women\u2019s\nemotionality (versus rationality) (Daly 1979).\n\nRadical feminists and lesbian feminists who disagree with Daly as to\nwhether women\u2019s moral natures are innately better than\nmen\u2019s agree with Daly in arguing either for essentialism\n(Griffin 1978; cf. Spelman 1988 and Witt 1995) or for\nwomen\u2019s separation from men (Card 1988; Hoagland 1988). Some of\nthem argue that separatism allows a setting in which to create\nalternative ethics, rather than merely responding to the\nmale-dominated ethical theories traditionally discussed in the\nacademy. They also argue that separatism better fosters women\u2019s\nincreased connection to each other and denies men the access to women\nthat men might expect (Daly 1979; Frye 1983; Hoagland 1988).\n\nIn deep disagreement, philosophers such as Alison Jaggar argue against\nseparatism as being in any way productive of a different and morally\nbetter world. Jaggar maintains that \u201cwhat we must do instead is\nto create a new androgynous culture which incorporates the best\nelements of both \u2026, which values both personal relationships\nand efficiency, both emotion and rationality. This result cannot be\nachieved through sexual separation\u201d (Jaggar 1974, 288). Related\narguments for androgynous approaches to ethics are influential in\narguments supporting androgyny, gender bending, and gender-blending\nthat are prevalent in the 1990s (Butler 1990; Butler 1993), and\ngender-eliminativist and humanist approaches to feminist ethics and\nsocial philosophy that are prevalent in the twenty-first century\n(LaBrada 2016; Mikkola 2016; Ayala and Vasilyeva 2015; Haslanger\n2012).\n\nOne criticism of gender binarism is that its assumption marginalizes\nnonconforming individuals. In efforts described as promoting coalition\nbetween trans activists and non-trans feminists, some feminists argue\nthat we ought to examine the gender privilege inherent in presuming a\nbinary that reflects one\u2019s own experience better than the\nexperiences of others (Dea 2016a; Bettcher 2014). Yet such\n\u201cbeyond-the-binary\u201d approaches, in turn, have been\ncautioned against as well-intentioned but, at times, invalidating\ntrans identities, \u201cby invalidating the self-identities of trans\npeople who do not regard their genitals as wrong\u201d or \u201cby\nrepresenting all trans people as problematically positioned with\nregard to the binary\u201d (Bettcher 2013). Recognition of\n\u201creality enforcement\u201d and its interconnection with racist\nand sexist oppression may better defray the harms of normalizing a\ngender binary (Bettcher 2013).\n",
