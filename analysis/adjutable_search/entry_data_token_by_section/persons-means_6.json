    "main_text": "Treating Another Merely as a Means and Acting Wrongly\n4. Treating Another Merely as a Means and Acting Wrongly\n\nKant holds that if someone treats another merely as a means, the\nperson acts wrongly, that is, does something morally impermissible.\nSome accounts of treating others merely as means seem not to yield the\nconclusion that if a person treats another in this way, then he acts\nwrongly. On one \u201crough definition\u201d, we use another merely\nas a means if we both use the other and regard him\n\n\nas a mere instrument or tool: someone whose well-being and moral\nclaims we ignore, and whom we would treat in whatever ways would best\nachieve our aims. (Parfit 2011: 213 and 227)\n\n\nFor example, a kidnapper treats his victim merely as a means if she\nuses him for profit and thinks of him simply as a tool that she would\ntreat in any way necessary for profit. This account takes quite\nliterally \u201cmerely\u201d in \u201ctreating others merely as\nmeans\u201d. According to it, treating another merely as a means\namounts roughly to treating the other solely or exclusively as a\ntool.\n\nIf this is how we understand treating others merely as means, then\ndoing so does not always amount to acting wrongly, it\n appears.[10]\n Suppose that a gangster considers a barista a mere tool to get coffee\nand that he would treat her in whichever way would best serve his\ninterests. In buying coffee from her, the gangster treats her merely\nas a means on this account, but does not, it seems, act wrongly\n(Parfit 2011: 216).\n\nOn a more detailed, but similar, understanding of treating another\nmerely as a means, it also seems that the gangster might be doing so\nand yet not be acting wrongly. According to this account:\n\u201cTreating a person merely as a means is doing something toward\nthat person . . . on the basis of instrumental motivation, with no\nmotivational concern regarding any non-instrumental aspects of the\naction(s), and with a disposition not to acquire such a concern\u201d\n(Audi 2016 56\u201357).\n\n\nThese notions of treating others merely as means seem not to coincide\nwith Kant\u2019s notion of doing so. Recall Kant\u2019s example of\nmaking a false promise to another for financial gain. Suppose that a\nparticular false promiser would not do just anything to the other for\ngain for himself, for example, he would not murder the other\u2019s\nfamily. And suppose that this false promisor does have\nnon-instrumental motivational concern for the other in that he would\nnot make this false promise if it would likely result in the other\nneeding to declare bankruptcy. According to Kant\u2019s notion, but\nnot to these accounts, it appears, the false promisor would be\ntreating the other merely as a\n means.[11]\n\nWe might question whether treating another merely as a means amounts\nto acting wrongly even if we focus on the candidate sufficient\nconditions examined above. For the sake of simplicity, let us focus on\nthe possible consent account\n (\u00a73.2),\n according to which an agent treats another merely as a means if the\nother cannot consent to her use of him. (We could just as effectively\nemploy other proposed sufficient conditions we have discussed for just\nusing another.) Suppose that two muggers attack a victim. The victim\nviolently pushes one of the muggers into the other, so that he (the\nvictim) can make his escape. The victim uses the mugger he pushes, and\nthe mugger presumably is unable to avert this use simply by dissenting\nfrom it. Yet many would object to the idea that the victim is acting\nwrongly. One response to this issue would be to build into accounts of\ntreating another merely as a means the specification that one is not\ndoing that if he is using someone in order to prevent himself or\nsomeone else from being treated in this way. Building in this\nspecification would, of course, tend to make accounts somewhat\nunwieldy. Other examples might render more difficult to accept the\nidea that treating another merely as a means is always morally\nimpermissible. Suppose, for example, that we use one person to save a\nmillion people from nuclear conflagration, without giving the one any\nopportunity to avert the use by dissenting from it. We thereby treat\nthe one merely as a means, according to a possible consent account.\nBut do we act wrongly? Some hold that we do\n not.[12]\n\nThey might defend the view that while it is always wrong pro\ntanto to treat another merely as a means, doing so is sometimes\nmorally permissible, all things considered. In other words, we always\nhave strong moral reasons not to treat others merely as means, but\nthese reasons can be outweighed by other moral considerations,\npresumably including the good of many lives being preserved. If,\ncontrary to Kant\u2019s view, the moral constraint against treating\nothers merely as means is not absolute, then a question arises as to\nwhen it gets overridden.\n",
