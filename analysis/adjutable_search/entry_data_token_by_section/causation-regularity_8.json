    "main_text": "Inferential Theories of Causation || Strengthened Ramsey Test\n2.3 Strengthened Ramsey Test\n\nDrawing on Spohn (2006), Andreas and G\u00fcnther (2020) analyse\ncausal relations in terms of certain reason relations. This is the\nbasic schema of the analysis: \\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) is a reason for believing \\(E\\), and\n(ii)\nthe ordered pair \\((C, E)\\) satisfies a few further\nconditions.\n\n\nAndreas and G\u00fcnther specify the first condition by a strengthened\nRamsey Test, which emerges from an analysis of the word\n\u201cbecause\u201d in natural language. Ramsey (1931) proposed to\nevaluate conditionals in terms of belief change. Roughly, you accept\n\u201cif \\(A\\) then \\(C\\)\u201d when you believe \\(C\\) upon\nsupposing \\(A\\). This Ramsey Test has been pointedly expressed by\nStalnaker:\n\n\nFirst, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs;\nsecond, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency\n(without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent);\nfinally, consider whether or not the consequent is then true. (1968:\n102)\n\n\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1988) expressed the Ramsey Test in more formal terms.\nWhere \\(K\\) denotes an agent\u2019s set of beliefs and \\(K \\ast A\\)\nthe operation of changing \\(K\\) on the supposition of \\(A,\\) \\(A >\nC \\in K\\) if and only if \\(C \\in K \\ast A.\\) In the wake of work by\nRott (1986), Andreas and G\u00fcnther suggest strengthening the Ramsey\nTest as follows:\n\n\n\\(A \\gg C\\) iff, after suspending judgment about \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), an\nagent can infer \\(C\\) from the supposition of \\(A\\) (in the context of\nfurther beliefs in the background). (2019: 1230)\n\n\nThis conditional is then used to give a simple analysis of the word\n\u201cbecause\u201d in natural language: \n\n\\[\\text{Because } A, C \\text{ (relative to }K)\\;\\;\\;\\text{ iff }\\;\\;\\;A \\gg C \\in K \\;\\;\\; \\text{ and }\\;\\;\\; A, C \\in K\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(K\\) designates the belief set of the agent. This analysis may\nwell be incomplete, but proves useful for analysing causation. The\nnext step toward such an analysis is to impose further constraints on\nthe inferential relations between the antecedent and the consequent.\nFor the expert reader, it may be worth noting that the conditional\n\\(\\gg\\) is defined in terms of finite belief bases rather than\nlogically closed sets. Inferential relations between antecedent and\nconsequent can therefore be defined syntactically in terms of\nderivability.\n\nHow may the conditional \\(\\gg\\) be used to analyse causation? Suppose\nthe antecedent \\(C\\) designates a presumed cause and the consequent\n\\(E\\) a putative effect. It is first required by Andreas and\nG\u00fcnther (2020) that we can infer \\(E\\) from \\(C\\) in a\nforward-directed manner. That is, there is an inferential path between\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) such that, for every inferential step, whenever we\ninfer the occurrence of an event, no premise asserts the occurrence of\nan event that is temporally later than the inferred event. This\ncondition is a refined and slightly modified variant of Hume\u2019s\nrequirement according to which a cause always precedes its effect.\n\nSecond, the inferential path between \\(C\\) and \\(E\\) must be such that\nevery intermediate conclusion is consistent with our beliefs about the\nactual world. The idea is that there must be an inferential path\nbetween the presumed cause and the putative effect that tells us how\nthe effect is brought about by the cause. This inferential\nrepresentation of how the effect is produced by the cause must be\nconsistent with what we believe the world is like.\n\nThird, every generalization\u2014used in the inferential path between\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\)\u2014must be non-redundant in the following sense: it\nmust not be possible to derive the generalization from other explicit\nbeliefs. (A generalization is simply a universal sentence, which may\nrepresent a strict or non-strict law.) By means of this condition,\nAndreas and G\u00fcnther (2020) try to solve the problem of spurious\ncausation in common cause scenarios. Suppose there is a thunderstorm.\nThen, we have an electrical discharge that causes a flash which is\nfollowed by thunder. The flash precedes the thunder, and there is a\nregular connection between these two types of events. But we would not\nsay that the flash is a cause of the thunder. So, we need to\ndiscriminate between forward-directed inferences with a causal meaning\nand other forward-directed inferences that lack such a meaning. Note\nthat we can derive the event of the flash and the event of the thunder\nfrom the electrical discharge in a forward-directed manner using only\nnon-redundant generalizations, that is, universal sentences that we\nthink are relatively fundamental laws of nature. Among these are the\nlaws of electrodynamics, atomic and acoustic theory, and optics.\nHowever, the only inferential path from the flash to the thunder that\nis forward-directed requires redundant generalizations: universal\nsentences that we can derive from more fundamental laws (see Andreas\n2019 for details). The strategy is that spurious causal relations can\nbe excluded by requiring the generalizations used in the inferential\npath to be non-redundant. This strategy works in the mentioned common\ncause scenario. It remains to be seen whether this strategy works in\nfull generality.\n\nIn sum, \\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\)\u2014relative to a belief\nstate\u2014iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) are believed to be true,\n(ii)\nthe event of \\(C\\) precedes that of \\(E\\), and\n(iii)\nafter suspending judgement about \\(C\\) and \\(E\\), we can infer\n\\(E\\) from \\(C\\) in a forward-directed manner, without using redundant\ngeneralizations, and without inferring sentences that are inconsistent\nwith our beliefs.\n\n\nObviously, this analysis is epistemic, just as Hume\u2019s analysis\nof causation in the mind as well as Ramsey\u2019s and Spohn\u2019s\nanalyses are. Condition (ii) is needed because this condition is not\nimplied by the requirement that the inferential path between \\(C\\) and\n\\(E\\) is forward-directed. (Such an implication does not hold because,\nstrictly speaking, forward-directedness of the inferential path means\nthat no inferential step is backward-directed.) The problem of\ninstantaneous causation is addressed in Andreas (2019), at least for\nsome causal scenarios. Andreas and G\u00fcnther (2020) deliver\nrigorous solutions to a number of causal scenarios, including\noverdetermination, early and late preemption, switches, and some\nscenarios of prevention. Singular causal relations without a regular\nconnection among \\(C\\)-type and \\(E\\)-type events are not\naddressed.\n",
