    "main_text": "The S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga account of the emotions\n3. The S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga account of the emotions\n\nUnlike the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and Ved\u0101nta accounts\nof the emotions, the S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga account does not draw a\nfundamental distinction between feelings and cognitions. The reason\nfor this is that the S\u0101\u1e43khya account rests on the division\nbetween puru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti. The former\nis pure consciousness and does not contain any cognitions or feelings\nwhereas prak\u1e5bti is primordial matter and has the three\nqualities (gu\u1e47as) sattva, rajas and\ntamas, which are aligned with different feelings:\nsattva with pleasure (sukha), rajas with\npain (du\u1e25kha) and tamas with confusion or\nillusion (moha). The terms sattva, rajas\nand tamas are difficult to translate but are sometimes\nrendered as \u201creflection\u201d, \u201cactivity\u201d and\n\u201cinertia\u201d. The important point about this dualist\nstructure for the emotions is that, according to the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya account, both cognition and feeling belong to the\nrealm of prak\u1e5bti which means that they are material.\nThis stands in contrast to many dualist accounts in the history of\nWestern philosophy, for example that of Descartes, according to which\ncognitions are immaterial whereas emotions or passions are material,\nthus making it easier to oppose the two. Larson and Bhattacharya\n(1987) summarize the difference between Western and S\u0101\u1e43khya\ndualism in the following way:\n\n[A]ccording to S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophy, the experiences of\nintellect, egoity, and mind, and the \u201craw feels\u201d such as\nfrustration or satisfaction\u2014or, in other words, what\nconventional dualists would consider to be \u201cinherently\nprivate\u201d\u2014are simply subtle reflections of primordial\nmateriality, a primordial materiality undergoing continuous\ntransformation by means of its constituent unfolding as spontaneous\nactivity, reflective discerning, and determinate formulation. Thus,\nthe modern reductive materialists\u2019 claim that \u201csensations\nare identical with certain brain processes\u201d would have a\npeculiar counterpart in the S\u0101\u1e43khya claim that\n\u201cawarenesses\u201d [Sanskrit terms omitted] are identical with\ncertain gu\u1e47a modalities. (Larson and Bhattacharya 1987,\np. 76)\n\n\nThe relationship between puru\u1e63a and\nprak\u1e5bti in S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophy is complex:\npuru\u1e63a as pure consciousness is characterized by\ninaction (akart\u1e5bbh\u0101va) and pure presence\n(s\u0101k\u1e63itva). It does not stand in any relation with\nprak\u1e5bti, which comprises the material world, including\nmental processes. Nevertheless, puru\u1e63a forms the\nfoundation of prak\u1e5bti. This means that\npuru\u1e63a provides the meaning for all material processes.\nThus prak\u1e5bti exists for puru\u1e63a and it is\nonly because of this that the world is not simply a collection of\nmeaningless physical processes. In addition, the intellect as part of\nprak\u1e5bti is supposed to realize that it is not\nconsciousness and it is to become aware of pure consciousness as the\nway to liberation. This means that the intellect is supposed to\nunderstand the contentless pure consciousness but of course in order\nto do so it would have to become contentless itself, which seems\nimpossible. Therefore, the intellect can only achieve this in an\nindirect way without cognition. Instead, we require meditative or\nyogic exercises to understand the difference between\npuru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti.\n\nIn spite of the fact that cognition and emotion are both material,\nemotions have a negative connotation in S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophy.\nIn this regard the account is similar to that of many Western\nphilosophers. However, in Western philosophy the idea is to have\ncognition free from emotion. By contrast, the S\u0101\u1e43khya\nphilosophers do not think of cognition as a desirable end in itself.\nRather, their idea is that ultimate liberation lies in the recognition\nof puru\u1e63a by prak\u1e5bti. This means that\nour everyday experience of ourselves as conscious intellects with\ncognitions and emotions is an obstacle on the way to realizing what\npure contentless consciousness is. In fact, S\u0101\u1e43khya\nphilosophers argue that our experience of ourselves as conscious\nbeings is a mistake that needs to be rectified in order to achieve\nliberation. This realization is extremely difficult to achieve and\ntherefore S\u0101\u1e43khya proposes first of all to clear the mind\nof the passions [SSu 2.15] by separating them from cognition and then\nto free the mind from cognition in order to comprehend contentless\nconsciousness. So emotions or passions are regarded as negative but\nthey are not contrasted with cognitions because cognitions themselves\nare supposed to be overcome in order to understand\npuru\u1e63a.\n\nIn the Yogas\u016btras, Pata\u00f1jali provides a method\nfor understanding the difference between puru\u1e63a and\nprak\u1e5bti via a series of exercises that aim at stripping\naway all of the disturbing influences from the mind, including what\nWestern philosophers would classify as emotions. In fact,\nPata\u00f1jali argues that the mind is affected by afflictions\n(kle\u015bas) that keep it from becoming clear about the\ndifference between puru\u1e63a and prak\u1e5bti.\nIn YS 2.3, Pata\u00f1jali lists the afflictions:\n\nIgnorance (avidy\u0101), egoism (asmit\u0101),\nattachment (r\u0101ga), aversion (dve\u1e63a) and\nadherence [to mundane existence] (abhinive\u015ba) are\nafflictions. [YS 2.3]\n\n\nThese afflictions need to be removed in order to achieve liberation.\nUnlike in many Western accounts of the emotions, the removal of the\nafflictions is not supposed to lead to a form of rational thinking\nthat is divorced from any emotion. Rather, rational thinking itself\nneeds to be overcome, in order to achieve true liberation by\nseparating puru\u1e63a from prak\u1e5bti.\n\nThe main reason why emotions such as attachment and aversion are\nregarded as afflictions is that they lead to a desire to change our\ncircumstances and therefore to an attachment to the world. This\nattachment, however, is precisely what is to be given up in order to\nachieve liberation. So, Pata\u00f1jali and his commentators argue\nthat emotions lead to desire and therefore have to be given up as one\nof the root causes of ignorance that causes attachment to the world.\nOnly then can the mind discriminate between puru\u1e63a and\nprak\u1e5bti.\n\nOne interesting parallel between Western accounts of the emotions and\nPata\u00f1jali is the use of the \u201ccolouring\u201d\n(upar\u0101ga) or \u201ccoloured\u201d (uparaktam)\nmetaphor with regard to the mind [e.g., in YS 4.23]. Pata\u00f1jali\nclaims that the mind is \u201ccoloured\u201d by all of the objects\nit knows, including cognitions and emotions. This means that in order\nto understand the difference between itself and pure consciousness\n(puru\u1e63a), it has to free itself from these colourings\nand become pure. Only then can it recognize that it is different from\nthe puru\u1e63a which cannot be known in itself because it\ncannot become an object of the mind. Vy\u0101sa, in his commentary on\nYS 4.23, explains that the mind itself is an object that appears as a\nconscious subject which is why many philosophers mistake it for the\nsubject. However, once the mind becomes empty of all objects the\ndifference between the mind and puru\u1e63a reveals itself.\nVy\u0101sa makes the argument that a mind which is empty of all\nobjects can still know itself and thus it would have to become an\nobject in the mind, i.e., itself. In other words, cognition would have\nto be cognized by itself. This, however, is impossible, according to\nhim. Instead, puru\u1e63a shows itself as that which makes\ncognition possible. In this sense, puru\u1e63a can be\ncompared to Husserl\u2019s idea of the \u201ctranscendental\nego\u201d. So, puru\u1e63a can only reveal itself\nindirectly by emptying the mind of all cognitions, including emotions.\nThis means that emotions are regarded as an obstacle to liberation but\nat the same time, they share this designation with other cognitions of\nthe world.\n\nThe S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga account of the emotions thus shows some\nsimilarities with the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account in that\nboth regard the emotions as the first obstacle to liberation. Both\naccounts differ from many Western views in that they regard\nemotion-free thinking not as an end in itself but as the next obstacle\nto be removed. For the S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga philosophers there is a\ndistinction between veridical and non-veridical cognition\n(vij\u00f1\u0101na). The latter is classified as ignorance\n(avidy\u0101), which, together with certain emotions, forms\nthe afflictions (kle\u015bas). The Yoga-s\u016btras\n[YS 2.4] emphasize that ignorance is the most fundamental affliction\nthat is the root of all other afflictions. In his commentary on YS\n2.3, Vy\u0101sa states that \u201cthe afflictions are the five forms\nof unreal cognition.\u201d So, as Sinha points out:\n\nAll afflictions (kle\u015ba) are due to false knowledge\n(avidy\u0101) and can be destroyed by right knowledge. The\nYoga, like Spinoza, regards emotions as intellectual disorders which\ncan be cured by true knowledge. [Footnote omitted] (Sinha 1985, p. 97)\n\n\nWe therefore see similarities between a cognitive account of the\nemotions and the S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga account because both claim\nthat emotions have mental objects but at the same time there is a\ndifference in how emotions can relate to knowledge, with the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga philosophers claiming that knowledge and\nemotions are incompatible.\n",
