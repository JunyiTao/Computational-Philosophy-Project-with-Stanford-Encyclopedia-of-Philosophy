De triplici ratione cognoscendi Deum\n\nThe key to understanding the internal coherence of Agrippa\u2019s\nthought is to be found in his deepening interest in Neoplatonic and\nHermetic writings, which allowed him to define the relationship\nbetween faith and reason in a more comprehensive perspective. In the\nPlotinian (and Ficinian) theory of the tripartite division of\npsychological faculties (mens, ratio,\nidolum), mind (mens) represents the highest\nfunction, the head (caput) of the soul, the divine spark\npresent in every human being; when God creates each soul, it is into\nthis supreme portion that he infuses the innate ideas, which mind\ndirectly intuits in God. Reason (ratio) is an intermediate\nfunction between the mind, which continually communicates with God,\nand the lower powers (idolum, that is, the sensory\nfaculties), which are connected to the material world. Reason, the\nseat of the will, is free to conform to either of the contrasting\ndirections indicated to it by the other parts of the soul.\n\nThis more structured view was already capitalized in the short\ntreatise De triplici ratione cognoscendi Deum (On the\nThreefold Way of Knowing God), dedicated to William Paleologus in\n1516, but published only in 1529, in a version somewhat expanded by\nAgrippa before printing. The term ratio had many meanings for\nAgrippa. Firstly, it recounted the \u2018way\u2019 of divine\nrevelation. To manifest himself to mankind, God wrote three books, by\nwhich the three different religious cultures were able to know him.\nAncient philosophers, reading the book of nature, knew God through the\ncreated world; Hebrew theologians, reading the book of the law, knew\nGod through the angels and the prophets; Christians, reading the book\nof the Gospel, gained perfect knowledge of God through his son, made\nman. Secondly, ratio referred to the three\n\u201csteps\u201d (gradus) in the spiritual ascent of every\nhuman soul to God: sense perception, rational knowledge, and spiritual\nknowledge. Finally, like the scholastics, Agrippa intended\nratio as the epistemological criterion by which philosophical\nschools performed their theological investigations and reached their\nunderstanding of God\u2019s essence.\n\nAgrippa projected the history of the individual soul and of philosophy\nback into the time preceding human history: Adam\u2019s sin is the\narchetypal figure of the moral choices and intellectual options of his\ndescendants. Adam willingly renounced true knowledge when he, trusting\nmore in Eve than in God, presumed that he could achieve a knowledge\ncapable of making him equal to God. Similarly, each of us renews the\noriginal sin committed by Adam when our reason denies that it is\ncreated and proudly proclaims an autonomy of its own, shattering its\nharmonious relationship with God. Once the hierarchy of cognition has\nbeen destabilized, reason strives to find its contents in the senses,\nwhich are fallacious and deceptive, and builds up a science which is\nboth dubious and vain: devoid of foundation, inert, and morally\npernicious. Original sin is also repeated in the schools of\ncontemporary theologians, who try to know God by the wretched means of\ntheir rebellious reason. This is the science of those, who live\n\u201cin the realm of the flesh\u201d (Romans 8:9)\u2014the science\nof the \u201csophists of God\u201d (theosophistae):\nfatuous, arrogant, quarrelsome and immoral, unable of transforming\ntheir notions into actions, that is, of solving the crisis of which\nthey are both authors and victims. Contemporary culture, as the fruit\nof this rebellious reason (which is, after all, Aristotelian and\nscholastic reason), is fated only to describe, to lightly touch on the\nstructure of reality, without being able to penetrate it.\n\nAgrippa was not professing any form of anti-intellectualism, but he\nwas applying the Platonic (broadly speaking) model of the tripartite\nsoul to the Christian way of knowledge. In accordance with this\npattern, if reason respects its subordination to the mind, that is, to\nthe message, which God has implanted directly in the soul, it fulfils\nthe role which has been assigned to it in the project of creation,\nwhich is to know God by means of the book of nature. On the other\nhand, since the book of nature is written by the hand of God, the\nfundamental goodness of the world is implied; and it is also implied\nthat human beings have the ability to read these pages and are,\nindeed, obliged to do so. Reason is therefore perfectly literate and\nlegitimate when it comes to deciphering this bundle of communicative\nsigns. Nonetheless, the book of nature is a means through which God\nhelps us to return to our origin. Therefore, the reading should be\ndone with our eyes fixed more on the author of the book than on its\ncontents: the knowledge of physical reality is merely a way of\nretracing through sensible objects the cosmic process of love, which\nis centered on the eternal Good, \u201cbeginning, middle and\nend\u201d of everything which exists. Humanity\u2019s greatness\nresides purely and simply in its capacity to grasp God by\ncontemplating his works, the created symbols which bear witness to\ntheir creator. Moreover, when reason \u201csilences\u201d the\nsensory part of the soul and turns itself inwards to its highest\nfunction, it becomes conscious of the constant illumination of the\nmind by God. At that moment, reason grasps essences by an intuitive\nact which is superior to the purely rational one, insofar as it is a\n\u201ccontact of the essence with God\u201d. This is not a mystical\nexperience. It is an intellectual experience, founded on some\nintuitive philosophical certainties, which revelation proves true.\nFaith (fides) does not provide new contents, but unveils the\ndeep sense of the existing contents of the reason, which is operating\nin harmony with the mind. A truly Christian philosopher, however,\ncannot be satisfied with having achieved individual knowledge. The\ncommandment to love our neighbor requires us to become \u201cleaders\nof the blind\u201d (Matthew 15:14), \u201ca corrector of the\nfoolish\u201d and \u201ca teacher of the immature\u201d (Romans\n2:20). Contemporary \u201cbad shepherds\u201d (pupils of \u201cthe\nschool of Satan\u201d, as the only preserved manuscript of De\ntriplici ratione called them) neglect their spiritual\nresponsibilities. Therefore, the \u201cnew\u201d Christian\nphilosopher has to turn into theologian, teaching the path to general\nredemption to his brothers in Christ. In addition, he has to take care\nof the social benefits deriving from his knowledge. Agrippa slightly,\nbut significantly, modified the most celebrated sentence of the\nHermetic Asclepius: \u201cA human, Asclepius, is a great\nmiracle!\u201d) by stating: \u201cA Christian human is a great\nmiracle!\u201d (Magnum miraculum est homo Christianus!, p.\n146).\n\nThe allegorical interpretation of the original sin which Agrippa\nborrowed from Paulus Ricius\u2019 Isagoge\n(Introduction) was repeated two years later in his De\noriginali peccato (On Original Sin), written in 1518,\nbut published in 1529. Adam is faith, the foundation of reason. The\nTree of Life, that is, the privilege of knowing and contemplating God,\nwas reserved to him. Eve is reason, which was allowed to have a\nrelationship with the snake, that is, with material things and the\nsenses. Unlike Adam, she was not forbidden to eat from the Tree of\nKnowledge, that is, to know the physical world. Our ancestors were\nequally responsible for original sin, but in different ways:\nEve/reason, because she placed trust and hope in the senses and\nweakened faith\u2019s firmness with her arguments; Adam/faith,\nbecause he, wishing to indulge his woman, turned away from God to the\nsensory world, relying entirely on the conclusions which reason drew\nfrom senses. Agrippa did not generally censure the potential of\nreason, but emphasized the hierarchical link between faith and reason.\nWe are not allowed to debate de divinis (\u201cabout divine\nmatters\u201d), in which we must only have faith and hope. Instead,\nwe can speculate about created beings, but not have faith and hope in\nthem.\n\nThe allegory was also invoked in his famous eulogy of women, De\nnobilitate et praecellentia foeminei sexus (On the Nobility\nand Superiority of the Feminine Sex), by which Agrippa hoped to\ningratiate himself with Margaret of Austria. Among all the topics\nwhich he meticulously collected from the rich repository of this\nliterary genre, he also proposed a more philosophical argument in\nfavor of women, analyzing Eve\u2019s role in original sin. It was\nAdam, who introduced spiritual death into the world, since Eve was not\nprohibited from eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge: thus, she\nwas not guilty of disobeying God. Agrippa did not claim that Eve was\ncompletely without sin. More modestly, he maintained that her sin did\nnot entail transgressing God\u2019s commandment; she sinned\nnevertheless because she allowed the snake to tempt her and became the\noccasion of Adam\u2019s sin. She was deceived and went\nastray\u2014not \u201cinvoluntarily\u201d (Van der Poel 1997: 210),\nbut \u201cignorantly\u201d. What should we understand by\n\u201cignorantly\u201d? Agrippa could not seriously regard\nEve\u2019s ignorance as a defect in her spiritual progress (as\nAugustine did in his The Literal Meaning of Genesis) or as a\nweakness of her spiritual faculties (as Isotta Nogarola did in her\nDialogue on Adam and Eve). In the opening of the treatise,\nAgrippa, recalling humankind\u2019s creation (Genesis 1:26\u20137),\nunderlined that both Adam and Eve had been created in God\u2019s\nimage and likeness: as rational souls, both shared the same\npsychological faculties, the same teleology, and the same moral\nfreedom. The seeming inconsistency can be resolved by interpreting the\nbiblical progenitors as \u201cfigures\u201d of Neoplatonic\npsychology. Reason\u2019s ignorantia Dei (\u201cignorance\nof God\u201d) is not a passive \u201cnot-knowing\u201d (which is,\nin any case, unthinkable, because God is not concealed in unfathomable\ntranscendence, but \u201cshines everywhere\u201d in nature, and,\nabove all, inside humans). On the contrary, reason\u2019s\nignorantia Dei is an active \u201cneglecting\u201d, a will\nto turn away from God and a pride in being an end in itself.\n",
