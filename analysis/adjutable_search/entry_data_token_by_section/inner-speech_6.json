    "main_text": "Content-Based Theories of Inner Speech || The Phonological Content View\n3.1 The Phonological Content View\n\nTo say that inner speech has phonological contents is to say that\ninner speech episodes represent phonemes (or phones), where\nphonemes are the most basic meaningless building-blocks from which any\nword of a language can be built. There are 44 phonemes in English,\ndifferent combinations of which account for the distinct sound each\nword has in relation to all other words from which it can be aurally\ndistinguished. The notion of a phoneme is somewhat of an abstraction,\nhowever, as slightly different sounds (in terms of pitch, timbre, and\nfrequency) can fall within the sonic range that constitutes a single\nphoneme type. These more specific, concrete sounds that can qualify as\ninstantiations of a phoneme are known as phones. Whether\ninner speech episodes represent phonemes or, instead, the\nfiner-grained property of being a phone is a matter of\ndispute among those who hold that inner speech episodes have\nphonological contents (Patel 2021; Langland-Hassan 2018; Hill\n2022).\n\nNote also that, while the phonemes of most natural languages are\nauditory in nature\u2014and are thus perceived through the sense of\nhearing\u2014the notion of a phoneme has also been applied to\ngestural languages, such as American Sign Language (Sandler 2012;\nStokoe 2005). So, the concept of a phoneme is not specific to any\nmodality. It refers to the smallest meaningless units of a language\nthat can be arranged and recombined to form the smallest meaningful\nunits of that language, no matter which modality the language occurs\nin. In spoken languages, however, the auditory modality takes\nprecedence over the visual/written modality, insofar as the phonemes\nare typically held to be sounds, while the graphemes are held to be\nletters or groups of letters that represent phonemes. While most will\nnot consider the visualization of graphemes and written words to be\ncases of inner speech, it bears noting that such visualizations\nsatisfy the neutral characterization of inner speech provided at the\noutset.\n\nThere are several reasons one might hold that inner speech episodes\nhave phonological contents. The first is phenomenological in nature.\nWhat it is like to have an inner speech episode is similar to what it\nis like to hear oneself saying the corresponding words aloud. One\nmight explain this phenomenological similarity by appeal to the fact\nthat inner speech episodes and the corresponding cases of hearing\nrepresent similar properties\u2014either phonemes or phones of a\ncertain sort\u2014and, accordingly, have similar contents. A second\nreason appeals to the fact that we can use inner speech episodes to\njudge whether two visually dissimilar written words\u2014such as\n\u201cblood\u201d and \u201cmud\u201d\u2014rhyme. As rhyming is a\nrelationship between the sounds of words, the usefulness of inner\nspeech episodes in judging rhymes would be explained if inner speech\nepisodes represented word sounds and thereby allowed us to compare\nthose sounds (Langland-Hassan 2014). A third reason that has been\nproposed for thinking that inner speech has phonological contents is\nthat it is the representation of those features that allows one to\ndiscern which language we are exploiting when engaged in inner speech\n(Langland-Hassan 2018). (See Patel 2021 for a rebuttal.)\n\nJackendoff (1996, 2007, 2011) proposes that auditory contents exhaust\nthe contents of inner speech. Jackendoff\u2019s view is motivated in\npart by a prior commitment to the thesis that we do not think in a\nnatural language. Like many in cognitive science, he sees natural\nlanguage primarily as a means for communicating thoughts that\nthemselves occur unconsciously in some other medium (such as a\nFodorian \u201cMentalese\u201d). According to Jackendoff, thought\nitself is never conscious, nor is the use of concepts. By contrast,\ninner speech\u2014what he calls the \u201ctalking voice in the\nhead\u201d (1996: 10)\u2014occurs consciously and does not involve\nthe use of concepts. In having inner speech, he explains, \u201c[w]e\nexperience organized sounds\u201d, whereas,\n\n\nthe content of our experience, our understanding of the\nsounds, is a different organization \u2026 called conceptual\nstructure. (emphasis original, 1996: 12\u201313)\n\n\n\u201cThe organization of this content\u201d, he holds, \u201cis\ncompletely unconscious\u201d (1996: 13). Jackendoff identifies the\ninner voice with a representation of \u201cphonological\nstructure\u201d, a representation having phonological content, yet no\nconceptual or semantic content. Whereas, the mental states\nconstituting our understanding of what the voice is saying,\nhe notes, are distinct conceptual states that occur unconsciously:\n\n\nWhat we experience as our inner monologue is actually the phonological\nstructure linked to the thought,\n\n\nhe explains.\n\n\nWe are aware of our thinking because we hear the associated sounds in\nour head. (Jackendoff 2011: 613)\n\n\n(See also Jackendoff [2007: 80\u201385] where he remarks on the\ncounterintuitive nature of his view: \u201cHow can the contents of\nconsciousness consist of just a string of sounds?\u201d [2007:\n85].)\n\nIt should be noted that Jackendoff also suggests that inner speech\nepisodes \u201cexpress\u201d thoughts, which would seem to support\nthe view that such episodes have the semantic contents of our thoughts\n(e.g., \u201cthe linguistic modality can make reasons as such\navailable in consciousness\u201d [1996: 19] and \u201conly through\nlanguage can such concepts form part of experience rather\nthan just being the source of intuitive urges\u201d [1996: 23]). On\nthe other hand, he equally emphasizes the overlooked fact that\n\u201clinguistic structure has three major departments: phonological,\nsyntactic, and semantic/conceptual structure\u201d, and that\n\u201cthe forms in awareness\u2014the qualia\u2014most closely\nmirror phonological structure\u201d (2007: 81). Most recently, he has\nproposed a view where what we intuitively mark as \u201cconscious\nthought\u201d has three components: a \u201cpronunciation\u201d of\nthe thought, a feeling of meaningfulness, and the meaning attached to\nthe pronunciation. There he holds that only the first two are\nconscious and appears to identify inner speech with the\n\u201cpronunciation\u201d component. This is in keeping with the\nphonological content view, as the (semantic) meaning of the\npronunciation is something separate from the pronunciation and is only\nrepresented \u201cbackstage\u201d (i.e., unconsciously) (Jackendoff\n2012: 84\u20135).\n\nLangland-Hassan (2014) provides a qualified defense of a phonological\ncontent view, motivated by worries about how a single mental\nstate\u2014in particular an episode of inner speech\u2014can be said\nto represent both word sounds and word meanings simultaneously. He\nnotes that a word\u2019s meaning and its sound are entirely distinct\nproperties, related only by convention. If mental states are\nindividuated by their contents, then it seems that distinct neural or\nfunctional states will be needed to represent these distinct\nproperties. This has become known as the \u201cbinding problem\u201d\nfor inner speech (see Munroe 2023; Patel 2021; Berm\u00fadez 2018\nfor different approaches to resolving it; see also Prinz 2011 for\nrelated remarks). In light of this problem, Langland-Hassan proposes\nthat ordinary episodes of inner speech likely consist in two or more\nmental states triggered at roughly the same time (this would be a\nmultiple-state version of the \u201cmixed contents\u201d view,\ndiscussed below). Yet he adds that, when inner speech has been divided\ninto distinctly occurring states in this way, there are good reasons\nto identify inner speech solely with the component that represents\nword sounds. Doing so results in a phonological content view.\n",
