    "main_text": "\n\n\nLogic is usually thought to concern itself only with features that\nsentences and arguments possess in virtue of their logical structures\nor forms. The logical form of a sentence or argument is\ndetermined by its syntactic or semantic structure and by the placement\nof certain expressions called \u201clogical constants.\u201d[1]\n Thus, for example, the\nsentences\nEvery boy loves some girl.\n\n\nand\nSome boy loves every girl.\n\n\nare thought to differ in logical form, even though they share a\ncommon syntactic and semantic structure, because they differ in the\nplacement of the logical constants \u201cevery\u201d and \u201csome\u201d. By contrast, the\nsentences\nEvery girl loves some boy.\n\n\nand\nEvery boy loves some girl.\n\n\nare thought to have the same logical form, because \u201cgirl\u201d and \u201cboy\u201d\nare not logical constants. Thus, in order to settle questions about\nlogical form, and ultimately about which arguments are logically valid\nand which sentences logically true, we must distinguish the \u201clogical\nconstants\u201d of a language from its nonlogical expressions.\n\n\nWhile it is generally agreed that signs for negation, conjunction,\ndisjunction, conditionality, and the first-order quantifiers should\ncount as logical constants, and that words like \u201cred\u201d, \u201cboy\u201d, \u201ctaller\u201d,\nand \u201cClinton\u201d should not, there is a vast disputed middle ground. Is\nthe sign for identity a logical constant? Are tense and modal operators\nlogical constants? What about \u201ctrue\u201d, the epsilon of set-theoretic\nmembership, the sign for mereological parthood, the second-order\nquantifiers, or the quantifier \u201cthere are infinitely many\u201d? Is there a\ndistinctive logic of agency, or of knowledge? In these border areas our\nintuitions from paradigm cases fail us; we need something more\nprincipled.\n\n\nHowever, there is little philosophical consensus about the basis for\nthe distinction between logical and nonlogical expressions. Until this\nquestion is resolved, we lack a proper understanding of the scope and\nnature of logic, and of the significance of the distinction between the\n\u201cformal\u201d properties and relations logic studies and related but\nnon-formal ones. For example, the sentence\nIf Socrates is human and mortal, then he is\nmortal.\n\n\nis generally taken to be a logical truth, while the sentence\nIf Socrates is orange, then he is colored.\n\n\nis not, even though intuitively both are true, necessary, knowable\na priori, and analytic. What is the significance of the\ndistinction we are making between them in calling one but not the other\n\u201clogically true\u201d? A principled demarcation of logical constants might\noffer an answer to this question, thereby clarifying what is at stake\nin philosophical controversies for which it matters what counts as\nlogic (for example, logicism and structuralism in the philosophy of\nmathematics).\n\n\nThis article will discuss the problem of logical constants and\nsurvey the main approaches to solving or resolving it.\n",
