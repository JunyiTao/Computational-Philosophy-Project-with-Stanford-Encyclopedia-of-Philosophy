General Characterization of Carnap\u2019s Philosophy\n1.1 Rational Reconstruction and Explication\n\nCarnap differed fundamentally from the western philosophical tradition\nin his conception of philosophy and his attitude toward philosophical\nproblems. These supposed problems, he thought, were largely artifacts\nof our inadequate tools\u2014they originate in confusions due to the\nlanguages our species has evolved over millennia to deal with the\npractical problems of a pre-scientific and pre-technological everyday\nlife. These primitive tools leave us unequipped even to express, let\nalone to address, the traditional problems of philosophy coherently;\nour inherited languages distort the picture too badly, and to see\nthings more adequately we need to devise new concepts and organize our\nthoughts in less parochial categories. Just as we have devised new\nconcepts and vocabularies to find out about the world in systematic\nscientific inquiry, so we have to leave behind our traditional ways of\narticulating how everything fits together, how we should understand\nour place in the world, and how we should shape our lives in\nresponse.\n\nSo philosophical inquiry became, for Carnap, a kind of\n\u201cconceptual engineering\u201d (see Creath 1990, Flocke\nforthcoming-b) rather than a form of inquiry or search for knowledge.\nIt did not ask how things are, in Carnap\u2019s view, but rather\nhow\u2014within the constraints of our available tools and the\nknowledge available from the sciences\u2014we want things to\nbe. This form of \u201cvoluntarism\u201d (Jeffrey 1992) lies at the\nbasis of Carnap\u2019s philosophy from beginning to end.\n\nCarnap applied this voluntaristic conceptual engineering in many\ndifferent ways to many different problems, at different levels and on\ndifferent scales. He applied it both within science and to larger\nproblems about science (e.g., scientific language), or about\nthe place of science in our lives. He applied it both to local\nreconstructions or explications of particular concepts (e.g.,\nconfirmation), and more globally, to entire language frameworks (see\n section 1.2\n below). And he wanted the local and global to fit together; precise\ndefinitions of explicated concepts were to be situated within such\nlarger frameworks.\n\nThe terminology evolved over the years. Carnap tended to think of his\nfirst engineering projects as \u201crational reconstruction\u201d;\nlater he favored the term \u201cexplication\u201d. Both refer to the\nreconstruction or replacement of particular terms or concepts within\nour more primitive ordinary languages (or vestiges of them in\nscientific languages) rather than to the design and development of\nentire languages or language frameworks. There was a progressive\nchange of emphasis over the course of Carnap\u2019s career in the\ngoals and the scope of this reconstructive engineering. In the early\nyears Carnap (along with most of his colleagues in the 1920s Vienna\nCircle) saw these engineering projects in much the same light as the\neighteenth-century Encyclop\u00e9distes and\nnineteenth-century positivists had seen them. Ordinary language and\ntraditional concepts were to be overcome; they were to be\nreplaced by better and more scientific ones. Later,\nCarnap\u2019s view became more pluralistic and dialectical (Stein\n1992); he increasingly recognized the practical nature of conceptual\nengineering and allowed more room for the standpoint of the language\nuser, as well as the differing priorities and value systems involved\nin the choice of language frameworks or explications. Recently,\nCarnap\u2019s idea of explication has attracted a good deal of\nattention (Maher 2007; Kitcher 2008; Carus 2007a; Dutilh Novaes &\nReck 2017; Brun 2016; several papers in Wagner 2012), particularly\namong authors seeking to define the proper role of the new\nsubdiscipline of experimental philosophy (Justus 2012; Shepherd &\nJustus 2015; Schupbach 2017) or of the methodology of mathematical\nphilosophy (Leitgeb 2013). More details are to be found in the\nsupplement on\n Methodology.\n (For more on conceptual engineering more generally, see, e.g.,\nCappelen 2018.)\n1.2 Frameworks\n\nExplications or rational reconstructions were envisaged by Carnap as\nsituated (where possible) in larger linguistic or conceptual\nframeworks, constructed object languages with a hierarchy of\nmetalanguages in which to define and explore truth, analyticity,\nsynonymity, designation and other semantic resources of the object\nlanguage, and of the object language with respect to its\nextra-linguistic environment.\n\nFrameworks always involve logical consequence relation(s), their\ndefinition(s) of what follows from what logically. But this need not\nalways mean that frameworks have purely logical object languages that\nare then provided with empirical interpretations. Other modes of\ninference employed in existing scientific disciplines, including\nconceptual inference, experimental procedures, and the reasoning from\nthese, can also be reconstructed in or by frameworks. Carnap continued\nto hope that all of them could, eventually, be understood in more\nstraightforwardly logical terms, but he realized that this was a\nlong-term program and not immediately on the horizon. In particular,\nthe framework could also come equipped with an inductive logic, where\nthe deductive consequence relation for the object language is\naugmented by a numerical degree-of-confirmation assignment that\nsatisfies the axioms of probability. In any case, Carnapian language\nor framework go beyond what we now mean by a formal language: they do\nnot just involve a syntactic vocabulary and syntactic formation rules.\nFrom the modern logical point of view, a Carnapian framework is close\nto a logic or a formal theory (but perhaps with an interpretation),\nwhile from the philosophy of science point of view, a Carnapian\nframework is meant to reconstruct the conceptual and inferential\npresuppositions of a scientific theory rather than a scientific theory\nitself.\n\nCarnap\u2019s earliest attempts to develop frameworks, which sought\nto encompass the conceptual resources of all empirical knowledge, can\nbe found in Der logische Aufbau der Welt (1928a, The\nLogical Construction of the World), commonly referred to as the\nAufbau, its abbreviated original German title. Carnap there\nfocused on sketching a phenomenalist framework in which scientific\nconcepts could be constructed from pure observation. The idea was to\nhave a single framework relative to which any scientific sentence\nwhatsoever (other than purely logical or mathematical ones) could be\njudged to be cashable or not cashable in empirical, observational\nterms. However, as Carnap soon realized, the framework failed to\naddress theoretical scientific concepts, disposition concepts, or\nprobabilistic concepts, among much else.\n\nThe frameworks on which Carnap worked after this were less specific to\nparticular epistemological problems, and more abstract and general. In\nhis view, the specification of a framework was a prerequisite for any\nrational reconstruction of rational discourse whatsoever. As we will\ndiscuss in more detail below, his Logische Syntax der Sprache\n(1934, translated as The Logical Syntax of Language, 1937,\nhereafter LSS) worked out two different frameworks for mathematics\n(and physics) and developed a corresponding account of philosophy as\nthe logical syntax of the language of science. Soon after, Carnap\nfollowed Alfred Tarski in making the basic concept of\n\u201ctruth\u201d language-relative; and in 1950 he applied the same\nidea more explicitly to the basic concept of \u201cexistence\u201d.\nIt only made sense to speak of something \u201cexisting\u201d\nrelative to a framework (i.e., one could only speak of\n\u201cexistence\u201d as internal to a framework), he said,\nnot in any general sense (external to any framework\nwhatever). This deflationary conception of truth and existence (and\nmany other previously metaphysical concepts) again reflects\nCarnap\u2019s resistance to the suggestive traps set by ordinary\nlanguage and the philosophical tradition that has been too ready to\nfall into these traps.\n\nIn his later work, Carnap extended his construction of semantic\nframeworks by developing frameworks in which probabilistic relations\nplay a central role, including eventually frameworks for rational\ndecision and action (decision theory). The specific details of\nCarnap\u2019s various linguistic frameworks are discussed in the\nfollowing supplements:\n Aufbau (Section 1),\n Logical Syntax of Language,\n Semantics,\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories, and\n Inductive Logic.\n1.3 Pluralism and Tolerance\n\nCarnap differed from the philosophical tradition not only in his\nsuspicion of ordinary language and its potentially misleading\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d artifacts, and in his engineering impulse\nto replace our inherited languages by better-constructed and more\nprecise constructed linguistic frameworks, but also in his\nincreasingly pronounced pluralism among frameworks. In the\nAufbau, Carnap had already discussed the availability of\ndifferent frameworks (phenomenalist, physicalist, and more), and how\nthey were more or less suitable for different purposes (see the\nsupplement on\n Aufbau).\n But these frameworks still differed only in the choice of non-logical\nprimitives and in the definition of non-primitive terms\u2014the\nframeworks were still based on the same syntactic formation rules and\non one and the same logical system. As far as the explicit endorsement\nof syntactic and logical pluralism and tolerance is concerned, the\nturning point came in 1932, while Carnap was writing his book (now\noften considered his masterpiece) Logical Syntax of Language.\nThe starting point of that book, as we will see in more detail in\n section 4\n below, had been strongly motivated by the search for a single\nstandard language of science. But this was now combined with\nCarnap\u2019s new idea that, for philosophical statements\nabout science, the standard of communicative acceptability\nshould not (as in Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus) be that it\nhave meaning (that it picture some state of affairs), but\nthat it be translatable into the \u201cformal mode of speech\u201d.\nHis criterion for the scientific (non-metaphysical) status of a\nphilosophical statement, that is, had shifted from the reducibility of\na sentence to \u201catomic\u201d observation sentences to its\nexpressibility as a statement solely about linguistic artifacts\n(rather than about the supposed things and processes they refer to).\nBut Carnap had still thought, until late 1932, that a single standard\nlanguage for logical syntax could be found, and had invested a lot of\ntime in devising such a language system. At that point, however, two\nsets of controversies attracted attention: the so-called\n\u201cprotocol sentence debate\u201d about the correct form of\nobservation sentences (and by implication, the role of observation in\nscience), and the dispute about the foundations of mathematics among\nthe three schools of logicism, intuitionism, and formalism. Both these\ncontroversies came to seem to Carnap, after years of involvement in\neach of them, to stumble over artifacts of inherited language just\nlike the old philosophical problems the Vienna Circle thought it had\nswept away. He came to regard the different positions in these debates\nnot as potentially \u201cright\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d (or\n\u201cwrong\u201d or \u201cincorrect\u201d) but as different\nproposals for language frameworks in which to frame the questions,\ndifferent ways of articulating the problems surrounding empirical\nevidence and the nature of mathematics, respectively. And it seemed to\nhim that these proposals were mostly not mutually exclusive; on the\ncontrary, he came to think that many different alternative languages\nshould be pursued and developed to see how well they perform in\ndifferent contexts. He saw them as motivated by different needs and\nrequirements, perhaps by different ultimate values, and he thought the\ndiscussion of values should not be confused with the study and\ndevelopment of the language frameworks themselves: \u201cin\nlogic\u201d, he famously wrote in the Syntax (LSS:\n\u00a717), \u201cthere are no morals\u201d.\n\nThis new pluralism undermined the initial premise of the\nSyntax book on which he was working then, but Carnap\nnonetheless took it on board. The language he had initially been\nintending to propose as the single standard language of science was\nnow used simply as an example, and to be sure that it wasn\u2019t\ntaken too prescriptively Carnap also developed another language\n(Dr.-Seuss-like, he called them \u201cLanguage I\u201d and\n\u201cLanguage II\u201d), and stressed that both were acceptable,\nthough each had its strengths and weaknesses for different purposes.\nThe new linguistic pluralism was stated as the\n\n\nprinciple of tolerance: we are not in the business of setting up\nprohibitions but of arriving at conventions\u2026 In logic\nthere are no morals. Everyone is welcome to set up his logic,\ni.e., his form of language, as he pleases. If he wants to discuss it\nwith us, though, he needs to state his intentions clearly, and give\nsyntactical specifications rather than philosophical debates. (LSS:\n\u00a717)\n\n\nThis principle would remain a permanent, indeed the dominant,\ncomponent of Carnap\u2019s philosophy for the rest of his career. For\nmore details on Carnapian tolerance, see the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology (Sections 1 and 2).\n1.4 Metaphysics\n\nWhy, under this pluralism, should some statements and expressions\nstill be excluded, as not having any content, as not\nconveying anything but as being just empty verbiage that purports to\nsay something significant? Why, that is, should\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d still be excluded, as Carnap notoriously\ninsisted? Surely the metaphysician is as free as anyone else to choose\nher language?\n\nThese questions take us back to the engineering ethos described in\n section 1.1\n above, about explication and rational reconstruction. Language\nchoice, for Carnap, was not an end in itself but was rather in the\nservice of freeing ourselves from the distorted perspective on the\nworld imposed on us by our inherited natural languages. These\nlanguages had not evolved to optimize the transparent representation\nof knowledge, but for very different, primitive practical purposes.\nFor the pursuit of knowledge, and insight into the human condition in\nthe light of that knowledge, better languages are needed. What makes a\nlanguage \u201cbetter\u201d? In principle Carnap leaves that open.\nEveryone has their own values about what they want languages to do for\nthem, and will choose accordingly. But Carnap\u2019s own values were\nthose of the Enlightenment. His value hierarchy placed the value of\nescaping from the complacent, passive acceptance of authority, or of\ntraditional or folk ideas\u2014and finding something objectively\nbetter\u2014near the top. The replacement of knowledge accepted\npassively from authority or tradition by objective knowledge was his\ngoal just as it had been the goal of the\nEncyclop\u00e9distes. And by \u201cobjective\u201d\nknowledge, Carnap meant essentially scientific and practical\nknowledge, just as they did.\n\nThis did not mean a rejection of the humanistic tradition, or of\ndimensions to values other than the scientific and\nengineering-oriented. Carnap took entirely for granted (so deeply that\nhe hardly ever bothered to make it explicit) that literature, art, and\nmusic shaped people\u2019s values and were closely connected with\nthem. But these were for individuals to negotiate. Since his\nexperience of the First World War, he had realized that the German\nintelligentsia\u2019s political indifference, its overindulgence in\nhumanistic individual values, had been partly to blame for the war. He\nhad resolved, therefore, to attend more to the framework that all\nhumans shared, and that formed the basis for their social and\npolitical cohabitation. Objective knowledge was, to him as to the\nEnlightenment, at the core of this shared framework. Practical\n(especially political) decisions should be informed ones,\narrived at in the light of the best possible knowledge about the\navailable choices and their consequences.\n\nMetaphysics was, in his view, a distraction from this program.\nMetaphysics was a kind of failed art form masquerading as knowledge,\nso it was both fake art and fake knowledge. Unlike a logical\nor mathematical proof or the confirmation of a scientific theory,\nmetaphysical proposals are unable to command widespread agreement;\neven the criteria by which they should be judged are often in\ndispute.\n\nOn the other hand, all of Carnap\u2019s repeated attempts, over\nseveral decades, to give a precise delineation\u2014to explicate the\ndistinction\u2014between scientific (or meaningful or communicatively\nadequate) statements and metaphysical (non-scientific, non-meaningful)\nones failed. He therefore became more liberal and less exacting about\nwhat was to be regarded as metaphysical. He was willing to allow that\nmany metaphysical theories of past philosophers (he cites Aristotle,\nLeibniz, Kant, Peirce, and Whitehead, among others) could be regarded\nas useful steps toward the construction of \u201cthe most general\nframeworks containing categorial concepts which are fundamental for\nthe representation of all knowledge\u201d, and moreover that he\nhimself regarded this task as among \u201cthe most important problems\nof philosophy\u201d (Carnap 1963b: 862). See the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology (Section 2 and 3)\n for further detail.\n1.5 Verification and Confirmation\n\nCarnap\u2019s life-long quest to explicate the distinction between\nstatements that genuinely convey something and empty verbiage that\nonly purports to say something (metaphysics) began with\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus, the Vienna Circle\u2019s\nprovisional starting point. The Circle interpreted Wittgenstein as\nrequiring what Carnap later called a \u201cmolecular\u201d language,\nby which he meant a language that permitted only finitely restricted\nquantification. This posed an obvious problem in that scientific\ntheories, the very paradigm of what the Circle regarded as proper\n(non-metaphysical) knowledge, nearly all contain unrestricted\nuniversal quantifiers and thus range, in principle, over an infinite\nnumber of instances. As Carnap already acknowledged in his first\nwritings on the subject, well before Popper appeared on the scene,\nthis meant that theories could not, strictly speaking, be verified;\nthey could only be confirmed up to a certain confidence level, or\ndisconfirmed (e.g., Carnap 1926: 7\u20139).\n\nAs we will see in\n section 5\n below, this and related problems constituted a large part of the\nCircle\u2019s agenda during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The\nimportant thing to keep in mind through all this is that \u201cthe\nverification principle\u201d in its crude form was never advocated by\nCarnap or any other major figure in the Circle. (More detail on this\nin the supplement on\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 1).)\n In the Aufbau, Carnap had, it is true, worked out a\nfinitist, \u201cmolecular\u201d phenomenalist language and advocated\nthe epistemological benefits of reconstructing scientific concepts on\nits basis. During this period, he was attracted to a form of radical\npositivism that played down theories as mere auxiliary devices for the\nprediction of observations. The observations that confirm theories, in\nthis view, was really all there was to science, in what amounted to a\nkind of instrumentalism about theories, as it would later be\ncalled.\n\nBut soon afterwards, in his Logical Syntax, and more\nexplicitly when he published \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d in\n1936\u201337, Carnap decisively distanced himself from such\ndoctrines. In the light of the new principle of tolerance, the\nobsession with just one standard language form seemed unnecessarily\n\u201cabsolutist\u201d and rigid. In \u201cTestability and\nMeaning\u201d it is stressed that many different language forms are\npossible in science and should be investigated, and that none is\n\u201ccorrect\u201d or uniquely acceptable for the purposes of\nscientific confirmation. The point is to devise languages that meet\ncertain goals of inquiry better than others, in the awareness that\nsome languages may be better for the pursuit of one goal, while other\nlanguages are preferable for other goals. This is perhaps the first\nfully explicit expression of the engineering ethos described in\nsection 1.1 above.\n\nThis period also marks a return to the recognition that radical\npositivism of the \u201cmolecular\u201d or Tractatus sort\nhardly does justice to actual science\u2014so Carnap returns now to\nscience as it actually is done rather than an idealized, purely\nfactual science. This meant, once again, an acceptance that\ntheoretical vocabulary needed to be accounted for in one\u2019s\nconception of science. Another kind of concept characteristic of\nactually practiced science that gets special attention in\n\u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d is disposition concepts (e.g.,\n\u201csoluble\u201d or \u201crefrangible\u201d; more on\ndisposition concepts in the supplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 2)).\n Probabilistic concepts would soon come into focus as well as a\nsignificant preoccupation.\n1.6 Theory Reconstruction and Inductive Logic\n\nFrom this period, then, Carnap once again focused on scientific\ntheories, and on theoretical languages as not fully reducible to\nempirical observation sentences. While he had given up the effort to\nreduce theories to observations, he remained preoccupied with\nthe complementary problems of how a theory can be confirmed\nby observations, and how the empirical content of a theory\ncan be determined. Both of these problems were articulated, and seen\nas interrelated, in \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d, but\nthereafter they took separate paths. The first of these problems was\ncentral to Carnap\u2019s preoccupation with inductive logic from\nabout 1942, though he was never able to develop it to the point where\nit could be applied to the confirmation of theoretical\nsentences (as opposed to mere empirical generalizations). The second\nproblem was the focus of significant attention to the nature of\ntheoretical languages and the degree to which theories are constrained\nby evidence, as well as the problem how to identify the analytic and\nsynthetic parts of a theoretical hypothesis or a theory, i.e., to\ndistinguish what components of it come with the language framework in\nwhich it is expressed, and what components contain actual information\nabout the world. See sections\n 8.1\n and\n 8.3\n below on Carnap\u2019s further pursuit of both problems and his\ncontroversies and interactions with Popper, Hempel, and others on\nthese issues. The supplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Sections 3 and 4)\n deals in more detail with Carnap\u2019s distinction between\nobservation language and theoretical language in science, and with\nCarnap\u2019s reconstruction of scientific theories and theoretical\nterms by means of Ramsey sentences and related logical resources.\n\nHis own primary attention during the later years of his career was to\ninductive logic, where he began by distinguishing two fundamentally\ndifferent explicanda of the concept \u201cprobability\u201d: (i) the\nidea of probability as relative frequency of some occurrence\nin a series of events or in a population, which he regarded as a\nlegitimate and entirely empirical matter. He contrasted it with (ii)\nprobability understood as an epistemic measure of our\ncertainty or uncertainty about the empirical truth or adequacy of a\nstatement. The latter was Carnap\u2019s focus; at the outset he\nworked out a structural and logical conception of epistemic\nprobability, influenced by Waismann and Keynes, as further explained\nin the supplement\n Inductive Logic,\n and progressed over the years toward a more \u201cpersonalist\u201d\nview, though never giving up the logical conception entirely. He\nworked closely with various students and associates on these problems,\nespecially Richard Jeffrey, Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, and John Kemeny. See\n section 8.2\n below, see the supplement\n Inductive Logic\n for the details of his structural account of probability, and see the\nsupplement\n Methodology (Section 1)\n for his probabilistic explication(s) of inductive confirmation. Ray\nJ. Solomonoff\u2019s work on universal inductive inference was also\ntriggered by Carnap\u2019s inductive logic. (Solomonoff studied with\nCarnap in Chicago. See Sterkenburg 2018 for a discussion and\nevaluation.)\n1.7 Structuralism\n\nAnother strand of Carnap\u2019s indifference to ontology was his\nlifelong focus on structures as the main objects of\nknowledge. Even as early as 1922, Carnap had thought that mathematics,\ncorrectly understood, is not so much the study of quantity and number\nas the study of structures; Kant\u2019s dictum that something is\nscientific just insofar as it is mathematical was now superseded, he\nthought, by his new dictum that something is scientific just insofar\nas it is structural (Carnap 1922b: p. cl[r], translated and\nquoted in Carus 2007a: 163). And if the object of our knowledge is not\nthe particular or the qualitative but the structural, then, as Hermann\nWeyl had said, \u201cA science can determine its subject matter only\nup to an isomorphic representation\u201d.\n\n\nIn particular, it is altogether indifferent toward the\n\u201cessence\u201d of its objects of study\u2026It is mysticism\nto expect of scientific knowledge that it reveal\u2014to\nacquaintance\u2014a deeper essence than that openly available to\nacquaintance. The conception of isomorphism pinpoints the\nunquestionable and ineluctable limit to knowledge. (Weyl 1926: 22\n[1947: 25\u201326])\n\n\nWeyl speaks here in the language of axiomatic systems and their\nstructurally identical\u2014isomorphic\u2014models, a language\nlargely articulated at the beginning of the twentieth century by David\nHilbert. But Hilbert had only made more precise the notions of\nstructuralism that went further back and had animated a great deal of\nnineteenth-century mathematics (see Schiemer 2013), culminating in the\ngroup-theoretic (algebraic) understanding of the new non-Euclidean\ngeometries and Felix Klein\u2019s celebrated \u201cErlanger\nProgramm\u201d for the unification of geometry by this means, which\nalso inspired the early Bertrand Russell. Russell himself, and before\nhim Gottlob Frege and Richard Dedekind, had given\n\u201ctop-down\u201d definitions of structural concepts by means of\nhigher-order logical quantifiers (as in Frege\u2019s 1879 famous\ndefinition of the ancestral of a relation in his\nBegriffsschrift, or in Dedekind\u2019s 1888 definition of\nsimply infinite system in his Was sind und was sollen die\nZahlen?, or in Whitehead and Russell\u2019s 1910\u20131913\nPrincipia Mathematica), all of which influenced Carnap\nsignificantly. An equally important influence, at about the same time\nas Klein, was the epistemological structuralism of Hermann von\nHelmholtz. Carnap was clearly inspired by these ideas, not only in his\nearliest work, but all through his career, even into his work on\nprobability and induction, as we will see below\n (section 8).\n\nCarnap is best known, though, for his application of structuralism\nfirst to epistemology, in the Aufbau, and then to mathematics\nitself, in the Syntax and later work, as well as to\nmathematically formulated scientific theories. The frameworks\ndiscussed in section 1.2 above were always structural ones, in which\nCarnap invariably abstracted from the actual instantiation of the\nstructures in question in actual languages or conceptual systems, with\nthe result that even some of his closest allies and associates\nmisunderstood him, including (among others) Russell, Neurath, Popper,\nand Quine (see\n sections 3\n through 8 below for details). The articulation of these structural\nframeworks is discussed in the supplements\n Aufbau,\n Logical Syntax of Language,\n Semantics,\n and\n Reconstruction of Scientific Theories.\n\nCarnap\u2019s structuralism about mathematics also points forward, in\nits anticipation, for instance, of Tarski\u2019s structural\ndelimitation of logic modeled on the Erlanger Programm (Tarski 1986,\nSher 1991), and has recently been seen as a precursor of a new form of\nmathematical structuralism based on homotopy type theory in its\nemphasis on invariance (Awodey 2017).\n\nFrom the Aufbau (see the supplement\n Aufbau (Section 2)\n on Carnap\u2019s early structuralism) to his mature reconstruction\nof scientific theories (see the supplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 6)\n on Carnap\u2019s later structuralism), Carnap sought to articulate\nan innovative type of conceptual or linguistic\nstructuralism about science that is metaphysically neutral and which\nresembles modern versions of structuralism about mathematics: the\ncognitive content of what can be asserted precisely and meaningfully\nin science can be reconstructed as a structural constraint on\nempirical content, and one should aim at such structural\nreconstructions as they enhance the objectivity of science. While\nstructural properties are expressed using logical concepts usually\ndiscussed in the context of deductive logic, Carnap\u2019s\nlater work on inductive logic considers probability measures\nthat are logical or structural in the analogous sense, i.e., where\nprobabilities remain invariant under isomorphisms. This\n\u201cinductive structuralism\u201d is discussed in supplement\n Inductive Logic.\n1.8 Values\n\nCarnap is not generally known for his (very sparse) publications about\nvalues, but what he did publish is sufficient (in conjunction with\nrecently published texts) to yield a fairly accurate insight into his\nthinking, which turns out to be sufficiently original to have\nsignificant potential for further development. Carnap\u2019s main\npublication on values is the final (and longest) chapter of his\nreplies to critics in the Schilpp volume (the Reply to Kaplan, Carnap\n1963b). On the basis of this text, Carnap has generally been\nclassified simply as an (ethical) non-cognitivist. And there is a\nclose resemblance between Carnap\u2019s proposed logic of normative\nstatements (\u201coptatives\u201d, Carnap calls them) and that of\nRichard Hare (1954) published at about the time Carnap\u2019s reply\nwas written (though it was not published until 1963). The term\n\u201cnon-cognitivist\u201d to describe the view that normative\nstatements cannot be true or false (and that therefore no\n\u201cought\u201d can be derived from an \u201cis\u201d, as Hume\nhad put it), was, in fact, proposed by Carnap\u2014one of his more\nwidely-accepted (if low-profile) coinages.\n\nHowever, it had been assumed that since Carnap required a framework to\nbe in place for any kind of rational discourse to be possible, the\nchoice of frameworks itself must be simply a matter of personal whim,\nat the level of Hume\u2019s declaration that there is no rational\nargument for me to prefer the relief of a pain in my little toe to the\nprevention of some world-engulfing catastrophe. This problem of the\nirrationality of framework choice (George 2012) or\u2014put another\nway\u2014the supposed infinite regress in the selection of\nmeta-frameworks for the choice of framework (Richardson 2007;\nSteinberger 2016; Carus 2017) has been discussed recently from various\nangles. It is a special case, in the way Carnap is still usually seen,\nof the supposedly more general impossibility, for Carnap, of bringing\nreason to bear on normative choices, since in his view all reasoning\nseems to presuppose internality to a framework.\n\nBut from an interpretive viewpoint, this was clearly an unsatisfactory\nposition, since Carnap had in fact from his earliest days used\nreasoning to argue for normative positions, and continued to do so all\nhis life. So there seemed to be a tension, at such a basic level that\none would surely think Carnap must or should have been aware of it. In\nfact, there is no tension, as it turns out that Carnap (at least in\nhis later years and probably for much of his career) held a\nquasi-Kantian view whereby the logical reasoning we employ in\nmathematics, logic, and science (including inductive logic and\ndecision theory) is conceived as subordinate to (and narrower in scope\nthan) a purely normative form of reasoning\u2014in Kantian terms,\nVerstand (understanding) is subordinate to (and narrower\nthan) Vernunft (reason). So at least it appears from a\nrecently published fragmentary draft Carnap wrote in 1958 of a\ncontinuation of or sequel to the reply to Kaplan about values that had\nappeared in the Schilpp volume (Carnap 2017); see the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology\n for further discussion.\n\nMore recent forms of normative non-cognitivism have recast their\ndoctrines somewhat to describe them as \u201cexpressivist\u201d\n(Blackburn 1993; Gibbard 1990). From this starting point Huw Price\n(1988) has sought to generalize expressivism to include not only\nnormative language but other kinds as well. In some more recent\nexpositions of this proposed globalized expressivism or\n\u201cfunctional pluralism\u201d (Price 1997; see also Creath 1994\non the sense on which Carnap\u2019s view can be called\n\u201cfunctionalist\u201d), he invokes Carnap\u2019s conception of\nmathematics as the exemplar on which he proposes to model his approach\nto all sectors of language; he calls this the \u201cCarnap\nthesis\u201d, and assigns it fundamental importance in the\ndevelopment of a new \u201cglobal expressivism\u201d as he also\ncalls his position (Price 2013, 2018). In view of the discussion\nabove, it would seem that Carnap himself had already generalized his\nfunctionalist \u201cCarnap thesis\u201d regarding mathematics to at\nleast values and possibly also to other sectors of language (Carus\n2018; Price 2018). This is also consistent with the new-found interest\nin Carnap\u2019s \u201cinferentialism\u201d (Peregrin 2011,\nforthcoming; Chalmers 2012), discussed further in\n section 5\n below. Perhaps, in some respects, current philosophy is beginning to\ncatch up to Carnap.\n\n(General surveys of Carnap\u2019s work can be found in, e.g., Mormann\n2000, Friedman and Creath 2007.)\n2. Toward the Aufbau\n2.1 Beginnings\n\nCarnap was born on 18 May 1891 in the small town of Ronsdorf, now part\nof Wuppertal, an industrial city near the Ruhr area of northwestern\nGermany. His mother was a schoolteacher, and her father, Friedrich\nWilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld (1824\u201393), had been a leading educator and\neducational thinker in the Herbartian tradition. Carnap was\nhome-schooled by his mother until secondary school, and brought up\nreligious, but the emphasis was on the ethical, rather than the\ndoctrinal, dimensions of religious life. As a result, Carnap said, he\nhad no crisis of conscience when he later abandoned any belief in God\nor the supernatural. In 1908 the family moved to Jena, into the house\nof another famous relative, Carnap\u2019s maternal uncle Wilhelm\nD\u00f6rpfeld (son of Friedrich Wilhelm), a well-known and highly\ninfluential archaeologist. Carnap made trips to Greece with his uncle\nduring this time. He subsequently finished secondary school in Jena\nand enrolled in the university there, studying philosophy, physics,\nand mathematics, vaguely intending to become a high-school science\nteacher.\n\nAt the University of Jena he soon encountered the \u201cSera\nCircle\u201d, an offshoot of the Youth Movement that swept Germany in\nthe years before World War I. He became enthralled with the idea, as\nhe later said, that social forms and behavioral standards did not have\nto be assimilated uncritically from the surrounding society, or from\ntradition, but could be freely invented. The \u201cvoluntarism\u201d\nthat suffuses every phase of his later philosophical career (Jeffrey\n1992) seems to have had its origins here. He became not only an\nenthusiastic participant in the Youth Movement but also a leader,\nrepresenting the Jena branch at the climactic national meeting of\nlocal Youth Movement groups at the Hoher Mei\u00dfner in 1913 (Werner\n2003).\n\nCarnap\u2019s first exposure to logic came from an obscure and\nreclusive professor of mathematics at Jena, Gottlob Frege. Carnap was\nso fascinated that he took every course Frege offered (including two\ncourses on Frege\u2019s Begriffsschrift and a course on Logic in\nMathematics). His resulting shorthand notes are sufficiently detailed\nto permit a reconstruction of Frege\u2019s response after the system\nof the Grundgesetze had been undermined by Russell\u2019s\nparadox (Reck & Awodey 2005). It would be another decade, though,\nbefore Carnap came to see Frege\u2019s logic as the key to a new way\nof doing philosophy. Carnap also studied with neo-Kantians and\nLebensphilosophen, including Bruno Bauch (whose course on\nKant\u2019s First Critique left a lasting impression), Herman Nohl (a\nstudent of Dilthey) and\u2014while in Freiburg for a\nsemester\u2014Heinrich Rickert, whose lectures Carnap was\nparticularly enthusiastic about.\n\nThe war interrupted this development. Carnap and his Youth Movement\nfriends, though hardly enthralled, felt they could not shirk their\nduty to serve. Carnap spent most of 1914\u201317 at the front (first\nthe eastern, then the western), and took part in some of the bloodiest\nengagements. In 1917 he was wounded, awarded the Iron Cross, and spent\nthe remainder of the war at a radio research facility in Berlin. He\nalso became politically active: he joined the (by then anti-war)\nIndependent Socialist Party, circulated excerpts from the world press,\nmostly critical of the German government, to friends with his comments\n(Werner 2015), and participated in the transformation of the Youth\nMovement (or parts of it) into a political force. He teamed up with\nKarl Bittel, another Youth Movement leader, to start the underground\nPolitical Circular, a newsletter for university Youth\nMovement adherents that appeared irregularly during the months\nimmediately preceding the German Revolution of 1918. In the first\nissue, Carnap reviewed two books on proposals for worldwide political\nunion (Carnap 1918a). He also prepared for publication a much longer\nand more detailed analysis of the entire political situation following\nGermany\u2019s military defeat, but the Revolution occurred just as\nit was to be published, and it never appeared. (See the editors\u2019\nintroduction to Carnap 2019; it has now been published, along with\nother early Carnap manuscripts, in Damb\u00f6ck, Sandner, & Werner\nforthcoming.)\n\nCarnap\u2019s newfound political orientation was a non-Marxist\nlibertarian socialism of a kind represented by Gustav Landauer\n(1870\u20131919), a writer much admired by both Bittel and Carnap\n(Carnap 1919: 124, as described in Carus 2007a: 59). What is most\nstriking about Carnap\u2019s unpublished analysis of the German\nsituation after the defeat, though, is how unpolitical it\nremains, in any literal sense. He certainly deplores the unwillingness\nof educated Germans to dirty their hands with politics, and urges a\nfundamental change in attitude, balancing the exclusive German\nemphasis on the contemplative life with greater involvement in the\nactive life. However, what Carnap calls \u201cpolitics\u201d in this\nanalysis is \u201ceverything\u2026 that has some connection with\nthe public social life of people\u201d\u2014which, as he makes quite\nexplicit, includes practically all human activities, including some\nvery ivory-tower ones. Indeed, the key to his advocacy of greater\n\u201cpolitical involvement\u201d is that he assigns intellectual\nwork a central and indispensable role in arriving at the \u201cform\nof community [Gemeinschaftsgestalt]\u201d that could serve\nto coordinate the vast and heterogeneous multitude of tasks and jobs\nthat have \u201csome connection with the public social life of\npeople\u201d. Only by virtue of such a \u201cform of\ncommunity\u201d can we hope to remove this otherwise anarchic hive of\nactivities \u201cfrom the realm of chaotic whim and subordinate them\nto goal-oriented reason\u201d [\u201cder choatischen\nWillk\u00fcr zu entziehen und der zielbewu\u00dften Vernunft zu\nunterwerfen\u201d] (Carnap 1918b: 17\u201318, translated and\nquoted in Carus 2007a: 63).\n2.2 Der Raum\n\nFor Carnap the basis for \u201cgoal-oriented reason\u201d could only\nbe a comprehensive system of knowledge, and this exhortation to remove\nthe design of our system of the sciences \u201cfrom the realm of\nchaotic whim\u201d, and to \u201csubordinate\u201d it to\n\u201cgoal-oriented reason\u201d reverberates throughout his early\nphilosophical papers (e.g., Carnap 1923: 107), which have now been\npublished together with English translations in Carnap (2019). In the\neditors\u2019 introduction to this new edition it is argued that this\nprogram was not just a momentary response to a particular crisis, but\ncontinued to inform the architectonic of Carnap\u2019s philosophy\nthroughout its development. This is hardly disputed with respect to\nthe immediately following stages of Carnap\u2019s career, addressing\nthe nature and design of the system of knowledge\u2014his\ndissertation on philosophical problems of space and geometry, Der\nRaum (1922a) and other early papers. Der Raum\n[Space] prefigures later works in its effort to disentangle\nvarious meanings of the word \u201cspace\u201d and to show that\nphilosophical confusion had resulted from the failure to distinguish\nthem clearly. In this case, Carnap distinguishes \u201cformal\u201d,\n\u201cintuitive\u201d, and \u201cphysical\u201d space. The first\nwas a purely logical or set-theoretic construction of space; the\nsecond was built up from a version of Hilbert\u2019s axioms\nrestricted to a local, subjective space; the third was the space of\nphysics. In each case, by separate arguments, Carnap reaches the\nconclusion that the space we must assume as the precondition for any\nknowledge is not Euclidean space, as Kant had argued (and some\nKantians such as Natorp were still arguing), nor even any metric\nspace, but topological space of arbitrarily many dimensions. While\nthis represents a form of (neo-)Kantianism Carnap would soon leave\nbehind, it was tempered by the critical role of the \u201cfactual\nbasis [Tatbestand]\u201d in deciding among mathematically\npossible kinds of physical space. The factual basis was determined\nonly up to the topological relations among its elements;\nCarnap\u2019s residual Kantianism is expressed in the topologically\n\u201cnecessary form\u201d (not reaching to metrical relations) our\nperception imposes on its elements (see Heis 2011 on the neo-Kantian\nbackground in the philosophy of geometry).\n2.3 The Aufbau Program\n\nA series of notes taken during this period exhibit Carnap\u2019s\npreoccupation with the question how the system of knowledge could,\nunlike the proposals of Diderot and d\u2019Alembert in the\nEncyclop\u00e9die and those in its wake such as\nComte\u2019s and Ostwald\u2019s (1914a, 1914b), be unified\ndeductively, as Leibniz\u2014and Frege\u2014had envisaged\n(on Ostwald as a starting point for Carnap during this period, see\nDahms 2016). What especially preoccupied the young Carnap was the\nchallenge of giving the system empiricist underpinnings, i.e., finding\ndeductive relations between sense perceptions and the abstract\nconcepts of the advanced sciences. For a year or two he struggled with\nthis problem without success, until finally, in early 1922, just\nbefore the publication of Der Raum, Carnap read Bertrand\nRussell\u2019s Our Knowledge of the External World (1914).\nHere he found his answer\u2014the concepts were to be derived not by\nanalysis of experience, and deduction from the resulting\nelements, but by construction, using a \u201cprinciple of\nabstraction\u201d (Russell 1914a: 44\u201345; see also Pincock\n2002). Experiences could be gathered into equivalence classes, and for\npurposes of constructing a \u201creal\u201d world, each such class\ncan be regarded as a concept, defined by its extension. Immediate,\nmomentary experience\u2014the basis for knowledge among positivists,\nphenomenologists, as well as fictionalists such as the German\nphilosopher Hans Vaihinger\u2014need not be transcended in such a\nconstruction. The hitherto insurmountable problem of forcing the fluid\ncharacter of lived experience into the straitjacket of deductive\nrelations disappears.\n\nThis move also overcame another traditional positivist and\nphenomenological obstacle to Carnap\u2019s project of a Leibnizian,\ndeductive system of knowledge, formulated most drastically by Hans\nVaihinger (who influenced Carnap in this regard): the\n\u201cchaos\u201d of subjective experience, as we immediately\nexperience it, has no structure whatever. Nothing is really\n\u201cgiven\u201d but the undifferentiated chaos itself. No\ndistinguishable \u201celements\u201d present themselves as naturally\nisolable from it or as inherently available, without externally\nimposed fictions. Russell\u2019s principle of abstraction\u2014his\nmethod of substituting \u201clogical constructions for inferred\nentities\u201d (such as qualities)\u2014solved this problem, but\nwith the addition of a small but indispensable contribution from\nphenomenology. What enabled Carnap to obtain the elements he sought\nwithout isolating identifiable elements within the\nundifferentiated \u201cchaos\u201d was a single act of\nphenomenological discernment: a partition of the entire\n\u201cchaos\u201d into just two sectors, which he called the\n\u201cliving\u201d and \u201cdead\u201d components of experience.\nThis one distinction allowed Carnap to arrange experiences into a\ntemporal sequence (\u201cdead\u201d experience is past;\n\u201cliving\u201d experience present), making it possible to\nidentify holistic temporal cross-sections of experience, in which the\ntotal experience of a given specious present remains intact as a\nmomentary whole. This chronological sequence of experiential\ntime-slices now gave Carnap the basic framework he needed for\nidentifying qualities as cross-temporal equivalence classes of\ndiscernable persistences across series of adjacent specious presents.\nThese holistic time-slices did not need to be analysed.\nQualities and qualitative relations could, rather, be\nconstructed as something like equivalence classes of\nsufficiently \u201csimilar\u201d persistences across a series of\nadjacent time-slices (up to any desired degree of precision in\n\u201csimilarity\u201d). The result was that what empiricists such\nas Hume or Mach had always hoped to achieve by \u201canalysis of the\nsensations\u201d could be achieved without analysis. Carnap\ncalled it \u201cquasianalysis\u201d (which is explained in more\ndetail in the supplement\n Methodology (Section 3)).\n Physical objects could be constructed as connected classes of\nqualities, and from objects the path to a \u201creality\u201d seemed\nclear.\n\nIn this early stage of what became the Aufbau project, Carnap\nstill followed Vaihinger in distinguishing sharply between the direct,\ngenuine, first-hand knowledge of the \u201cchaos\u201d and the\nfictive, constructed nature of \u201creality\u201d. But he put the\nboundary between them in a different place. This was because\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology offered an escape route from\nVaihinger\u2019s completely undifferentiated chaos. It yielded\ncertain distinctions within the chaos (e.g., between\n\u201cliving\u201d and \u201cdead\u201d experience) that could\nclaim a degree of objectivity. These distinctions, Carnap then\nthought, were not fictional, but actually extended the range\nof what could be genuinely known, even without fictions, just\nfrom the chaos itself. So Carnap\u2019s boundary between the\nimmediately known primary world (of sensory\n\u201cchaos\u201d plus a minimal, phenomenologically extrapolated\nstructure) and a fictive secondary world of\n\u201creality\u201d included more in the \u201cprimary\u201d\nsector than Vaihinger\u2019s. Carnap thought he could show on\nphenomenological grounds that the primary world is two-dimensional in\nall sense modalities (Carnap 1924). So the boundary between the fixed\nprimary world and the freely choosable secondary worlds\n(\u201crealities\u201d) was located at the ascent from two to three\ndimensions. Within the primary world, the construction proceeded\nentirely by explicit definition, beginning from the qualities obtained\nby quasianalysis. Secondary worlds, by contrast, are not uniquely\ndetermined. The construction of a secondary world proceeds, rather, by\noptimizing its fit to whichever fictions are chosen to guide the\nconstruction, subject to the constraint of the (fixed) primary\nworld.\n\nCarnap remained as radically pragmatist about the choice among\nfictions to guide this ascent as Vaihinger; the choice of fictions was\nentirely practical and purpose-relative. (For more on\nVaihinger\u2019s account of fictions, see, e.g., Chapter 1 of Appiah\n2017.) To obtain the scientific secondary world, Carnap\nmaintained, we need only two fictions, corresponding roughly to\nKant\u2019s categories of cause and substance: a principle of\ninduction (or uniformity of nature) and a principle of\n\u201ccontinuity\u201d (as Mach had called it), requiring certain\nclusters of perceptions, such as those grouped into a \u201cphysical\nobject\u201d, to remain constant, under certain conditions, while we\nare not perceiving them.\n\nSometime during 1924, the Aufbau project changed course\ndrastically, and arrived at essentially its later published form\n(Carus 2016). The phenomenological approach to the basis was dropped;\na fixed \u201cprimary world\u201d was no longer to be distinguished\nby phenomenological intimation from the various \u201csecondary\nworlds\u201d built upon it. Russell\u2019s \u201cconstruction\nprinciple\u201d, as Carnap called it, came to dominate the project,\nand would become the book\u2019s epigraph:\n\n\nThe supreme maxim in scientific philosophizing is this: Wherever\npossible, logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred\nentities. (B. Russell 1914a: 155)\n\n\nSo now the two-dimensionality of perceptual space, for instance, is no\nlonger obtainable from phenomenological discernment, but becomes as\nmuch a logical construction as everything else (Aufbau:\n\u00a7\u00a789, 117, 124). And in a talk Carnap gave about the\nAufbau project in Vienna in January 1925, we find a new\nguiding principle: \u201cOvercoming subjectivity\u201d (Carnap\n1925a, 1925b, as quoted in Carus 2007a: 168; 2016).\n2.4 Vienna and Wittgenstein\n\nAfter completing the Aufbau first draft in late 1925, along\nthese new lines, Carnap left for Vienna, where he became a lecturer\n[Privatdozent] and submitted the Aufbau manuscript\nto Moritz Schlick as his Habilitationsschrift. He immediately\nbecame an active participant in Schlick\u2019s weekly Circle, which\nwas embarking just then on yet another careful re-reading of\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus. This group would soon (due to\nOtto Neurath\u2019s effective propaganda) become known to the world\nas the \u201cVienna Circle\u201d, the fount of a new\n(anti-)philosophy known as \u201clogical positivism\u201d\u2014a\nterm Carnap never liked.\n\nLike others in the Vienna Circle, Carnap saw the Tractatus as\na basis for solving the perennial problem of accommodating the truths\nof logic and mathematics to empiricism. Wittgenstein was no\nempiricist, but his characterization of logical truth as a pure\nartifact of representation, empty of empirical significance, gave the\nVienna Circle what they needed. Their logicism extended\nWittgenstein\u2019s truth-functional conception of logic to the whole\nof mathematics, and their empiricism interpreted Wittgenstein\u2019s\natomic sentences as sense perceptions, along the lines of the\nElementarerlebnisse at the basis of Carnap\u2019s\nAufbau. This version of Wittgenstein made mathematics\nconsistent with empiricism. However, its weaknesses were obvious even\nto the Circle: First, from the empiricist perspective of the Vienna\nCircle, Wittgenstein\u2019s truth-functional conception of logic\nseemed to require finitism; even the most abstract theories of physics\ncould then employ only restricted, finitary quantification rather than\nunrestricted quantification over a potentially infinite number of\nobservations ( Aufbau: \u00a7180; Carnap 1936\u201337:\n\u00a723). And second, Wittgenstein\u2019s exclusion of\n\u201celucidations\u201d (meta-sentences about the object sentences\nframed in the language of science) was not only paradoxical (it made\nall statement and discussion of logical principles meaningless) but\nseemed at odds with recent developments in the foundations of\nmathematics, especially Hilbert\u2019s metamathematics, and the\nbrilliant use made of this approach by Skolem, Tarski, and by one of\nCarnap\u2019s own students, Kurt G\u00f6del. (In turn,\nG\u00f6del\u2019s arithmetization of syntax and his incompleteness\ntheorems would have an enormous impact on Carnap\u2019s Logical\nSyntax of Language just a few years later\u2014see the\nsupplement on\n Logical Syntax of Language\n for more details.)\n\nCarnap set to work, after his arrival in Vienna, to solve these two\nproblems. He embarked on a major project to explore \u201cgeneral\naxiomatics\u201d, in which he sought to show that Hilbertian\naxiomatics could be accommodated within the Wittgensteinian\nrepresentational framework\u2014i.e., he sought to show that the\nHilbertian \u201cmethod of bifurcation\u201d (into metalanguage and\nobject language), while mathematically useful, could ultimately be\nreduced to a Wittgensteinian single language. The immediate goal was\nto prove a fundamental completeness theorem, purporting to show that a\nconsistent axiom system is categorical just in case it is decidable\n(Awodey & Carus 2001). After three years of concentrated work on\nthis project (a substantial manuscript of several hundred pages\nsurvives in Carnap\u2019s papers), Alfred Tarski convinced him that\nthis theorem was defective, and that Carnap\u2019s attempt to work\nwithin a single language failed to capture the metamathematical\nconcepts fully (but see Schiemer 2013). And late in 1930, G\u00f6del\nactually showed that an important special case of Carnap\u2019s\ntheorem was false: second-order arithmetic, though categorical, is not\ndecidable. This famous result put an end to Carnap\u2019s project of\nfusing Hilbert and Wittgenstein.\n3. The Aufbau\n3.1 Main Point and Motivation of the Aufbau\n\nAs we saw in\n section 2\n above, the Aufbau project began as a continuation of the\nencyclopedic ambitions of the Enlightenment, in response to the\ncatastrophe of the war and the hopes inspired by the German\nrevolution\u2014only that in contrast to the eighteenth-century\nEncyclop\u00e9distes, and to similar projects since then,\nCarnap conceived the idea of a system of knowledge as a\ndeductive system, under the influence of his teacher\nFrege.\n\nBy the time of the book\u2019s publication the emphasis had shifted,\nbut the idea of bringing all concepts into a single deductive system\nsurvives. In a lecture given to a general audience in Vienna in 1929,\nCarnap explains the point of his book by telling a dialectical story\nof human history as a struggle between \u201ccritical\nintellect\u201d and \u201cimagination\u201d. At first imagination\nruled the day, but then in antiquity, critical intellect made a\ndiscovery that enabled it to put strict limits on imagination\u2019s\nclaims:\n\n\nThat is the discovery of one [single] comprehensive\nspace. All things are in space; any two things are always\nspatially related to each other. So there is also a path from me to\nany [given] thing.\n\n\nSo existence claims could now be subjected to a simple test:\n\n\nEvery thing is accessible. If someone now claims that a thing\nof a particular kind exists, I can demand of him that he show me the\npath from me to the claimed thing.\n\n\nImagination responds by relocating its gods and gremlins to remote or\ninaccessible locations, but as humankind explores more of the earth,\nthis stops working. So imagination \u201cgoes for a really radical\noption; it evacuates its creations to the non-spatial, the\n\u2018trans-spatial\u2019\u201d, which is plausible since we quite\nlegitimately refer to things that are not physical objects, so not\nlocatable in space. Feelings, mental images, and thoughts, for\ninstance, are non-spatial. So instead of situating its gods in a\nphysical location such as Mount Olympus, Carnap explained,\n\n\nthe putative God was removed from space into the realm of the spirits.\nGod was regarded now as a spiritual being without a body.\n\n\nBut people starting noticing \u201cthat something isn\u2019t quite\nright with that sort of claim, that there is something rather odd,\nsomething problematic about it\u201d. So imagination went further and\nreplaced theology with metaphysics.\n\n\nHere the concept of God no longer has anything physical or anything\nphysically rooted about it\u2026 The flight from the grasp of\ncritical reason with its spatial system appears to have been\ncompletely successful.\n\n\nBut critical intellect now has an answer: the Aufbau\nsystem\u2014\u201cnow a system is discovered that comprehends not\njust [corporeal] things, but everything thinkable, all concepts,\nwhether thing-like or not\u201d. This system is the natural successor\nand generalization, in Carnap\u2019s dialectical drama, of physically\nall-encompassing space:\n\n\nIn space all things have spatial relations to each other, and there\nhas to be a path of access from me to each thing. In the same way, on\nthe basis of the concept-system, an all-comprehending conceptual\nspace, so to speak, all concepts have relations to each other (in this\ncase logical, conceptual relations). And here there has to be a\nconnecting path to each concept from the contents of my experience,\ne.g., from my perceptions. Everything of which I can speak has to be\ntraceable back to things experienced by me. All knowledge I can have\nrelates either to my own feelings, mental images, thoughts, etc. or\ncan be derived from my perceptions\u2026\n\n\nThough Carnap had redesigned the system in 1924 to dispense with the\nphenomenological development of the \u201cprimary world\u201d from\nwhich the \u201crealities\u201d or \u201csecondary worlds\u201d of\nscience and everyday reality were constructed, it could be said that\nhe adopted Husserl\u2019s method of \u201cbracketing\u201d the\nsupposed external reality to which our subjective world appears to\nrefer\u2014and that he adopted it more radically and strictly than\nHusserl himself. For Carnap bracketed not just the external reality\nbut also the internal subjectivity, leaving only the bare logical\nstructure of the constitution system unbracketed (Carus 2016).\n3.2 Significant Aspects of the Published Aufbau\n\nIn the published Aufbau this abstemious bracketing policy is\napplied very strictly. Carnap adopts a principle of extensionality\nthat does not exclude the use of intensional languages in auxiliary\nroles, but denies them any ultimate significance. Fregean\n\u201cSinn\u201d (sense) is specifically excluded as merely\npsychological (\u00a744), having only \u201cepistemic value\u201d\nbut not \u201clogical value\u201d (\u00a750), which is limited to\nthe extensional meaning of an expression. Each step in the spelled-out\nconstitution of the subjective (\u201cautopsychological\u201d) world\nis explained not only in logical symbols but also in a simple\nparaphrase, then in \u201crealistic language\u201d (as ordinarily\nused in science) and finally in a language of \u201cfictive\nconstruction\u201d. But Carnap makes clear that this is solely for\nconvenience and to make the steps more transparent to readers. The\nfour languages may differ not only in form but in their\n\u201cSinn\u201d, their epistemic value (the different mental images\nthey elicit), he says, though their logical value is always identical\nand is expressed most neutrally and clearly in the symbolic language\n(\u00a795); for more detail, see the supplement\n Aufbau.\n\nBehind this radical extensionalism lies precisely the new strictness\nwith which Carnap applied the Husserlian \u201cbracketing\u201d\nstrategy in 1924\u2014ironically just at the time he abandoned the\nphenomenological development of the constitutional basis. (More\ndetails on Carnap\u2019s extensionalism are to be found in the\nsupplement\n Semantics (Section 2).)\n The most direct expression of this was a more thoroughgoing and\nself-conscious rejection of ontology. In the final chapter of the\nAufbau, which addresses some philosophical problems to which\nthe constitutional system can be applied, the overriding theme is the\nirrelevance of ontological questions to the actual constitutional\nsystem (Friedman 2007). And in the same year as the Aufbau\nCarnap published a pamphlet on Pseudo-problems in Philosophy\n(Carnap 1928b) in which the \u201cproblem of realism\u201d is the\nmost prominent example of such pseudo-problems.\n\nThe actual detailed construction of the autopsychological realm\noccupies only a small part of the book. The first sections focus\nlargely on what Carnap would later call \u201cclarification of the\nexplicandum\u201d (see\n section 1.1\n above). Carnap considers various options for the choice of basic\nelements (the elements or building blocks of which everything is\nto be constructed) and basic relations (the relations between\nand among these building blocks that is to effect the construction).\nThe radicalism of Carnap\u2019s push for simplification is expressed\nby his choice of only a single kind of basic elements,\n\u201celementary experiences\u201d, and a single basic\nrelation, \u201crecollection of similarity\u201d. The elementary\nexperiences were not isolated \u201csense data\u201d of traditional\nempiricism (the isolated pitch and timbre of momentary sounds or\ncolored points of the visual field that we find in Hume or Mach), but\nholistic time slices of total experience, from which nothing has yet\nbeen abstracted; Carnap was here attempting to do justice to the\npsychology courses he had taken as an undergraduate, where he had\nlearned about the new directions taken in Gestalt psychology\nby K\u00f6hler, Koffka, and others. By quasianalysis, an abstraction\ntechnique formalizing Russell\u2019s \u201cprinciple of\nabstraction\u201d, (see the supplement\n Methodology (Section 3))\n the similarities among these time-slices could retrospectively be\ngrouped (by repeated application of the basic relation, recollection\nof similarity) into something like equivalence classes of, say, a\ncertain color or a certain smell that were sufficiently similar. By\nthis means Carnap constructs the subjective cognitive world of a\nsingle mind in some detail, up to the point where, on that basis, a\nthree-dimensional objective world of space-time can be constructed\n(see the supplement\n Aufbau (Section 2)\n for more detail concerning some of these constructions).\n\nAt this crucial point of the Aufbau\n(\u00a7\u00a7125\u20137), the ascent from two to three dimensions,\nwhere Carnap stops spelling out the steps in detail, he also suspends\nthe explicit definition applied up to there, and instead resorts to an\ninformally described optimization approach, whereby certain fairly\nobvious desiderata (continuity of motions, temporal continuity of\nobjects and processes, etc.) are to be maximized subject to certain\n(again fairly obvious) constraints (see the supplement\n Aufbau (Section 3)\n for further details). The construction of the physical realm and the\nfurther realms on its basis (the heteropsychological, social,\ncultural, and value realms) are sketched very sparsely. The book ends\nwith a final section discussing some philosophical consequences of the\nconstitution system, addressing (though only obliquely, and hardly by\nname) both phenomenology and various forms of realism.\n3.3 Later Discussion of the Aufbau\n\nWhen the book was published in 1928, it was widely discussed and,\nalong with Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus, became one of the\nclassic texts of the Vienna Circle. Its effect was amplified in the\nEnglish-speaking world by A.J. Ayer\u2019s acknowledgement of Carnap\nas the philosopher to whom he \u201cowe[s] most\u201d in his\nbest-selling Language, Truth, and Logic (Ayer 1936), which\nwas understood as an accessible summary exposition of the supposed\nphenomenalism of the Aufbau, but misrepresented the book\nquite seriously. This misrepresentation contributed to the later\nneglect of the book among Anglo-American philosophers, which even the\nsophisticated discussion, critique, and further development by Nelson\nGoodman (1951) or the belated English translation (1967) could hardly\nbudge. It also allowed many preconceptions about the book to continue\ncirculating almost through the end of the twentieth century.\n\nOnly toward the end of that century did a revaluation set in,\ninitiated by Michael Friedman, who took issue, in a series of papers\n(later collected in Friedman 1999), with the entire English-speaking\ntradition (going back to Ayer) of seeing the Aufbau as a\nphenomenalist project of reducing all knowledge to sense impressions\non the model of Hume or Mach. Instead, Friedman pointed out, we should\nsee it in the context of its neo-Kantian origins. From that\nperspective, the Aufbau is better understood as seeking a new\nbasis of scientific objectivity\u2014achieving objective knowledge\ndespite the subjective starting point of individual perception, and\nthe structuralism discussed above\n (section 3.2).\n On the basis of Friedman\u2019s discussions, many others have since\ncontributed to the revaluation of the Aufbau (Richardson\n1998; Mormann 2000; Pincock 2005, 2009; the papers collected in\nDamb\u00f6ck 2016.)\n\nThis new interpretive interest in the Aufbau and its\nphilosophical context has also led to renewed efforts to reconstruct\nthe Aufbau\u2019s constitution system with new tools.\nGoodman\u2019s 1951 critique of quasianalysis has finally found\nresponses and repairs from Mormann (1994, 1997, 2009) and Leitgeb\n(2007); Leitgeb (2011) goes further and argues that if the goals of\nthe Aufbau strategy are limited in certain ways,\nGoodman\u2019s and Quine\u2019s critiques no longer apply (see the\nsupplement\n Aufbau (Sections 3 and 4)).\n Chalmers (2012) suggests a much more drastic rationalistic\nrevision of the Aufbau; where Carnap thought it would be\npossible, in principle, to derive all true scientific sentences\nwhatsoever from basic true sentences in an \u201cempiricistically\nacceptable\u201d constitution system just by means of the\nsystem\u2019s definitions, Chalmers drops any empiricist ambitions\nand replaces the role of definitions by that of a priori\nknowledge, including synthetic a priori knowledge (whose\nexistence Carnap of course denied).\n4. The Road to Syntax\n\nThe Wittgensteinian program favored by the Vienna Circle\n (section 2.4\n above) had collapsed in 1930. But Carnap soon recovered, and during a\nsleepless night on 21 January 1931, conceived of an entirely new basis\nfor the Vienna Circle\u2019s characteristic doctrines (Awodey &\nCarus 2009). Instead of trying to fuse Hilbert and Wittgenstein,\nCarnap now dropped Wittgenstein altogether and pursued a Hilbertian\napproach. \u201cMeaning\u201d was no longer rooted in the\ncorrespondence between configurations of elementary facts and their\nlinguistic representations. In fact, meaning was banished altogether,\nat least in our statements about the language of science (our\nmetalinguistic \u201celucidations\u201d such as those in the\nTractatus itself or the Aufbau). The scientific\nlanguage itself had empirical meaning, but how this was to be\nunderstood became a matter of dispute (the famous\n\u201cprotocol-sentence debate\u201d) within the Vienna Circle (the\nsentences recording observations were called\nProtokolls\u00e4tze by the Circle, which became\n\u201cprotocol sentences\u201d in English). This brought about\na split in the Circle between a more realistic \u201cright\nwing\u201d (who adhered to something closer to Wittgenstein\u2019s\npicture theory and held that once a state of affairs was\n\u201cregistered [konstatiert]\u201d by an observer there\ncould be no further doubt) and the \u201cleft wing\u201d who\nfollowed Carnap in his new reference-avoiding syntax program (see\nUebel 2007 on this debate). In any case our elucidations of the object\nlanguage remain, in the new syntax framework, entirely within the\nlinguistic realm; we are talking always and only about language. In\nlogical syntax, we should be careful not to talk about\n\u201cfacts\u201d or \u201cthings\u201d but instead only about\nsentences or thing-names. We should restrict ourselves in principle to\nthe \u201cformal mode of speech\u201d (sentences and names),\nemploying the \u201cmaterial mode of speech\u201d (facts and things)\nonly for convenience, and when we are sure we can translate it into\nthe formal mode. The (meta-)mathematical methods of Hilbert, Tarski,\nand G\u00f6del were, in other words, to be extended to the whole of\nknowledge.\n\nCarnap\u2019s immediate task was to create a canonical language for\nthe formal mode of speech. Taking his cue from Hilbert\u2019s\nmetamathematics, he began by stripping this language down to bare\nbones, eliminating all problematic assumptions. It would consist\nsimply of strings of dots on a page, and the basic laws of arithmetic\nwould arise unambiguously in the metalanguage from the immediately\nevident patterns of dots (e.g., the commutative law from the\nperceptibly equivalent number of dots counted from the left and from\nthe right). Carnap soon found he could not express certain essential\nconcepts in this limited language, and turned instead to a more usual\naxiomatized arithmetic. This also had the advantage that, by using\nG\u00f6del\u2019s new trick of arithmetizing syntax, Carnap could now\nmore easily express the syntax of the language (i.e., its logic) in\nthe language itself. So the syntactic metalanguage collapses into the\nobject language, and there is, as before, only a single language. The\ncanonical language for the formal mode of speech seemed within his\ngrasp.\n\nThis idea also gave Carnap a new route to the elimination of\nmetaphysics, superseding the Wittgensteinian strategy with its meaning\ncriterion. The new criterion dispensed with meaning. It required that\nany statement either be at the object level (straightforwardly\nfactual) or translatable into the formal mode of speech\u2014i.e.,\ninto the canonical language or an equivalent. Carnap assumed that his\ncanonical language, once fully worked out, could express the entire\nlanguage of physics, as well as containing its own metalanguage. Since\nthe Vienna Circle\u2019s \u201cunity of science\u201d program held\nthat all knowledge was expressible in the language of physics, Carnap\nproposed his canonical language as a universal language for\nall knowledge (Carnap 1932b). Another way of expressing the new\ncriterion, then, was that any acceptable statement must be phrased in\nthe language of physics. The new idea of January 1931 flowed into\nCarnap\u2019s discussions with Neurath and others to produce the new\ndoctrine of physicalism (Uebel 2007, 2018).\n\nBut the demands on the \u201ccorrect\u201d language for the formal\nmode of speech were exorbitant. Carnap had originally wanted to keep\nit weak and uncontroversial, but it had to be capable of expressing\nall the mathematics needed for physics. On the other hand, its\narithmetized syntax had to be capable of expressing the basic concept\nof \u201canalytic truth\u201d, or it would be impossible to\ndetermine when a formal-mode statement \u201cholds\u201d. Before\n1930, it had been assumed that provability was the standard of\nmathematical truth, but now G\u00f6del had shown that for each\nconsistent and recursively axiomatized system that included enough\narithmetic, some true sentences are not provable in the system. So a\ndifferent criterion was needed, but one that would still\u2014like\nprovability\u2014pick out the logically true sentences solely by\nmeans of the formation and transformation rules of the language.\nCarnap did attempt such a criterion for \u201canalyticity\u201d in\nthe first draft of his syntax book (entitled Metalogic),\nwritten in late 1931 and the spring of 1932. He sent the typescript to\nG\u00f6del, who pointed out that the new criterion was defective. In\nfact, he added, it is impossible to define analyticity or\nlogical truth in any metalanguage that can be faithfully\nrepresented in the object language (e.g., by arithmetization); this is\nnow familiar to us as Tarski\u2019s theorem on the indefinability of\ntruth. So Carnap\u2019s single-language approach fails after all\n(Awodey & Carus 2007, 2009).\n\nAnd without the single canonical language containing its own\nmetalanguage, there is no longer any reason to regard any particular\nmetalanguage as more \u201csuitable\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d\nthan any other. One option may turn out to be more useful\nthan another for particular purposes, but this is no reason to\nprivilege it as uniquely \u201ccorrect\u201d (or canonical). With\nG\u00f6del\u2019s assistance, Carnap developed a new definition of\nanalyticity, but it hardly seemed to matter any more; the language\nrelativity of any definition of truth or analyticity moved to the\ncenter of attention. The disputes about protocol sentences within the\nVienna Circle merged in Carnap\u2019s mind with the disputes among\nintuitionists, logicists, and formalists in the philosophy of\nmathematics.\n\nAll these disputes, he realized in the autumn of 1932, concerned the\nquestion of how to set up a language, which has no right or wrong\nanswers. One could only try out different ways, and see which ones\nworked better. This new attitude, which first appeared in\nCarnap\u2019s reply to Neurath about protocol sentences (Carnap\n1932b), received its definitive statement in the \u201cprinciple of\ntolerance\u201d quoted in 1c. above, enunciated in the\nLogical Syntax of Language (LSS: \u00a717). In this\nprinciple, the voluntarist and utopian convictions of his youth,\npartially submerged during the Aufbau period, finally found\nadequate philosophical expression. He spent the remainder of\nhis career absorbing the consequences of this breakthrough, and\nworking on a vast number of language projects within the new freedom\nit afforded.\n5. Logical Syntax of Language\n\nThe Syntax is probably Carnap\u2019s best-known book, and\nhas attracted much of the renewed attention to Carnap in recent years.\nAt the time of its publication, the Vienna Circle was disintegrating,\nits members were fleeing from political persecution, and philosophical\ncommunication was disrupted. Its English translation, published 1937,\nlacked context and was almost uniformly misunderstood by nearly\neveryone, with the partial exception of Quine, whose later work in\nlogic, the philosophy of logic, and logic-based philosophy was\ninspired by\u2014though sometimes opposed to\u2014the Logical\nSyntax. Through Quine, some of Carnap\u2019s ideas eventually\nalso found their way into the logic education of many philosophy\ndepartments in the US. On the other hand, what Quine understood, as is\nevident from his 1934 Harvard Lectures, immediately after the\nbook\u2019s publication (reprinted in Creath 1990), was the first\ndraft of the Logical Syntax, in which the principle of\ntolerance was still absent. So even his comprehension of the\nSyntax was partial and one-sided (Creath 1987, Friedman\n2006). In any case, the book was widely assumed to have been\nsuperseded by the time the translation appeared, now that Carnap had\nmeanwhile embraced semantics and dropped his insistence on the\n\u201cformal mode of speech\u201d (above,\n section 1.3).\n Only recently, therefore, has the Syntax come to be\nappreciated in its full radicalism.\n\nIn this recent work, the principle of tolerance has attracted the most\nattention. Previously, the rejection of meaning and insistence on the\nformal, rather than the material, mode of speech had been in the\nforeground since, after all, the entire philosophical Part V of the\nbook had been devoted to it, and Quine had reinforced that emphasis.\nIt is fair to say that the principle of tolerance taken by\nitself\u2014unlike the notion of analyticity or theses of\nconventionalism (see the supplement\n Carnap vs Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction)\u2014was\n hardly discussed before its present, belated reception in the Carnap\nliterature. It is a new idea on the philosophical scene today, whose\nconsequences are still being digested.\n\nIt certainly has lost none of its explosive revolutionary force as a\nradical program for philosophy (Creath 2009), and this is what has\nmost divided commentators. Like most revolutionary ideas, it has\nencountered steadfast and vocal resistance. Most commentators have\nbeen concerned to limit the scope of the principle of tolerance, to\ndilute it or trivialize it, while the appreciative minority has mostly\nremained defensive. Much of the literature, therefore, is devoted to\nclarification and the correction of misunderstandings (e.g., Goldfarb\n& Ricketts 1992; Ricketts 1994; Goldfarb 1995), rather than\npositive explorations of the principle of tolerance and its\nconsequences (with a few exceptions: Carus 2017, Kitcher 2008, Creath\n2009, Kutz, Mossakowski, and L\u00fccke 2010, Justus 2012). Thus the\nremainder of this section will, after a brief exposition of the\nbook\u2019s contents, focus on these recent discussions and\nclarifications. Carnap\u2019s principle of tolerance is discussed in\nmore detail in section 1 of the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology,\n and the Logical Syntax more generally in the supplement\n Logical Syntax of Language.\n5.1 Brief Exposition of Logical Syntax\n\nThe stated aim of the book is to show that logic is syntactical, i.e.,\nthat it consists in formal theories of linguistic symbols\u2014a\ntheory is \u201cformal\u201d, Carnap says (LSS [1937: 1]) when\n\n\nno reference is made in it to either the meaning of the symbols (e.g.,\nthe words) or to the sense of the expressions (e.g., the sentences),\nbut simply and solely to the kinds and order of the symbols from which\nthe expressions are constructed.\n\n\nThe idea had of course been suggested by Hilbert\u2019s \u201cmethod\nof bifurcation [Methode der Zweiteilung]\u201d as Carnap had\ncalled it, distinguishing a meta-mathematics with concrete meaning, on\nthe one hand, from mathematics proper, on the other, which was to be\nregarded as purely formal, and the formal properties of which (e.g.,\nconsistency) Hilbert had aimed to study and prove in\nmeta-mathematics\u2014a method which Carnap sought to extend from\nmathematics to the whole of knowledge. The \u201cchief motivation for\nmy development of the syntactical method\u201d, Carnap later wrote,\nwas this:\n\n\nIn our discussions in the Vienna Circle it had turned out that any\nattempt at formulating more precisely the philosophical problems in\nwhich we were interested ended up with problems of the logical\nanalysis of language. Since in our view the issue in philosophical\nproblems concerned the language, not the world, these problems should\nbe formulated, not in the object language, but in the metalanguage.\nTherefore it seemed to me that the development of a suitable\nmetalanguage would essentially contribute toward greater clarity in\nthe formulation of philosophical problems and greater fruitfulness in\ntheir discussions. (Carnap 1963a: 55)\n\n\nThat the main concepts of deductive logic (\u201ce.g., provability,\nderivability from given premises, logical independence, etc\u201d.)\nare purely syntactical was argued primarily by showing how they could\nbe defined in two exemplary languages without reference to the\nmeanings of any terms. Language I is a form of primitive recursive\narithmetic, and was intended to exemplify a constructivist kind of\nlanguage, while Language II contains classical mathematics. (In modern\nterminology, both of these \u201clanguages\u201d are really\ntheories.) Of the book\u2019s five parts, the first three are taken\nup with the development of these two languages. In part IV, Carnap\ngoes beyond the treatment of specific languages to sketch a template\nfor \u201cgeneral syntax\u201d; he tries to give a framework for the\nsyntactical development or description of any language whatever. He\nabstracts from the syntactical categories of the particular language\nunder consideration, and does not even assume he is given its set of\nvariables, the distinction between its logical and descriptive\nvocabulary, its negation symbol, or any other syntactic property.\nInstead, all these sets and concepts are to be defined solely from the\ntransformation (inference) rules of the language (see\n\u00a746\u201347); Carnap is developing here what we would now call a\nversion of \u201cproof-theoretic semantics\u201d or \u201clogical\ninferentialism\u201d (see the supplement\n Logical Syntax of Language\n for further details). Throughout all parts of the Logical\nSyntax, Carnap distinguishes between the \u201cd-terms\u201d\nspecifiable this way (derivable, proof, demonstrable, refutable,\ndecidable) from the \u201cc-terms\u201d (consequence, valid,\ncontravalid, determinate, incompatible, content, synonymous). Though\nboth are considered to be \u201csyntactic\u201d terms by Carnap, the\nc-terms seem closer to what we would now call \u201csemantic\u201d.\nThis raises the question, for the modern reader, what Carnap actually\nmeans by \u201csyntactic\u201d (or \u201cformal\u201d) here; and\nit turns out (as Carnap himself later recognized) that\n\u201csyntax\u201d includes much of what he would later call\n\u201csemantics\u201d. Indeed we find (Wagner 2009: 22) that\nlanguages I and II are not actually \u201cformal\u201d in our sense\nat all; they are interpreted languages. While the syntactic method, as\nCarnap here conceives of it, requires that the interpretations be\ndisregarded, a particular fixed interpretation implicitly remains in\nplace. Carnap often refers to the import of some syntactic result or\nattribute \u201cin material interpretation [bei inhaltlicher\nDeutung]\u201d (e.g., LSS: 30), and the material interpretation\nsometimes slips in to play a role in the argument. Accordingly, Tarski\n(1936 [2002]: \u00a72) characterizes Carnap\u2019s definition of\nconsequence for Language II in the Logical Syntax as\nsemantic, acknowledges that \u201cThe first attempt at the\nformulation of a precise definition for the proper concept of\nfollowing comes from R. Carnap\u201d (in the Logical\nSyntax), and regards his own model-theoretic definition of\nlogical consequence as essentially equivalent to Carnap\u2019s\n(though applicable to a broader range of formalized languages than\njust to Language-II-like languages; see the supplement\n Logical Syntax of Language).\n This character of the Logical Syntax as a transitional work\nbetween syntax and semantics raises many subtle interpretative and\nhistorical issues that require distillation of the actual argument\nfrom the (often newly-invented) terminology in which it is embedded.\nFortunately, Pierre Wagner\u2019s (2009) excellent handbook on the\nLogical Syntax provides the reader with a guide.\n\nFor all the technical apparatus, Carnap later acknowledged that\n\u201cthe investigation of philosophical problems was originally the\nmain reason for the development of syntax\u201d (Carnap 1963a: 55),\nand the final Part V of the book is devoted to these. The focus,\nhowever, is on the \u201csyntax\u201d idea itself, not on the other\nmain idea, the principle of tolerance. There is a simple reason for\nthis: Part V was almost entirely written before Carnap arrived at the\nprinciple of tolerance in late 1932, and when the book went to the\npublisher it had to be cut (the definition of\n\u201canalyticity\u201d for Language II (\u00a7 34d), for instance,\nwas not even included in the original book, only in the 1937 English\ntranslation). And Part V is devoted to a sustained argument for\nsticking to the \u201cformal mode of speech\u201d and avoiding the\n\u201cmaterial mode of speech\u201d unless it is translatable into\nthe formal mode. So it is hardly surprising that philosophers (see for\ninstance Wole\u0144ski 2003) took this to be the book\u2019s main\nphilosophical point and thought Carnap had left it behind after the\nembrace of semantics in 1935.\n5.2 Recent Discussion and Commentary\n\nMuch of the recent discussion surrounding the Syntax,\nespecially the principle of tolerance, was inspired by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s critique of Carnap, unpublished until 1995, that\nwas originally intended for the Schilpp (1963) volume on Carnap in the\nLibrary of Living Philosophers. G\u00f6del withdrew his\npaper, but six successive drafts of it were found in his\nNachlass, of which several have now been published\n(G\u00f6del 1995). It appears, from its title (\u201cIs Mathematics\nSyntax of Language?\u201d) and much of the exposition, to focus\nspecifically on the \u201csyntax\u201d thesis, or more generally on\nthe \u201clinguistic\u201d accounts of the foundations of\nmathematics deriving from Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus\n(Goldfarb 1995: 325). However, G\u00f6del himself understood that\nCarnap had meanwhile left behind that view (in its Logical\nSyntax form), and recent commentary has focused on the principle\nof tolerance (see section 1 of the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology\n for the details of G\u00f6del\u2019s criticism).\n\nCarnap\u2019s early-1930s syntactical method of avoiding reference\nfor terms in the philosophical metalanguage has recently been\nidentified as the first self-consciously worked-out program of what is\nnow often called \u201cinferentialism\u201d (Peregrin forthcoming),\na different form of which is especially championed by Robert Brandom\n(1994, 2000), and has been found attractive by others (e.g., Price\n2013). Though Carnap\u2019s inferentialism had different motivations\nfrom Brandom\u2019s program of \u201creference explained away\u201d\n(Brandom 1984), there is clearly at least an analogous strategy at\nwork. While Carnap himself left the syntax program in its original\nform behind when he went on to incorporate semantics into his overall\nprogram for scientific languages, the syntax episode with its\nexplicitly inferentialist agenda is now viewed by some (e.g., Chalmers\n2012, Peregrin forthcoming) an important innovation in its own right.\nSome of these commentators thus regard Carnap\u2019s later embrace of\nsemantics as a step backwards. That had also been the view of Neurath\nat the time (Uebel 2007, Mormann 1999, Carus 2019), and of Quine and\nothers later (e.g., Goldfarb & Ricketts 1992; Ricketts 1996;\nGoldfarb 1997). These criticisms are at least partly due to a\nperception that Carnap returned to a substantive conception\nof meaning such as the Wittgensteinian one he had dropped in 1931, but\nactually his conception of reference and meaning remained minimalist\nand schematic, much to the frustration of, e.g., Russell (1940; see\nPincock 2007), who sought a substantive account of the intrinsic\nnature of reference (see the supplement\n Semantics\n for further discussion).\n6. Semantics and Modality\n6.1 From Syntax to Semantics\n\nCarnap had moved to Prague in late 1931, where he became a full\nprofessor at the German University, and wrote both drafts of the\nLogical Syntax of Language. The published book had tried to\nfuse the three major ideas of 1931\u20132. First, in January 1931,\nhad come the rejection of Wittgenstein\u2019s picture theory of\nmeaning and its replacement by Hilbert\u2019s sharp distinction\nbetween a language (a calculus, a purely formal symbol system) and its\ninterpretation, with the requirement that a language be entirely\nspecified by explicit rules. Closely bound up with this was the second\nidea, the insistence on the \u201cformal mode of speech\u201d and\nthe avoidance of talk of meaning in the metalanguage. And third, late\nin 1932, had come the principle of tolerance: no language is\ndefinitive or \u201ccorrect\u201d, there is no logical\n\u201creality\u201d for a language to \u201ccorrespond to\u201d.\nBut within a year of the book\u2019s publication, the second idea had\nbeen dropped; Carnap incorporated Tarski\u2019s new semantical\naccounts of designation and truth, and extended his view of language\naccordingly. The first and third ideas, however, survived for the rest\nof Carnap\u2019s career. What did not survive was the overreaction\nagainst \u201cmeaning\u201d that accompanied the original insight of\nJanuary 1931\u2014the exclusive emphasis on the \u201cformal mode of\nspeech\u201d in meta-discourse. In distinguishing between a language\nand its interpretation, Carnap\u2019s first response had been to\nrestrict extra-linguistic interpretation to the object language (and\nthere to one particular\u2014physicalistic\u2014interpretation) and\ndispense with it entirely in the \u201celucidatory\u201d\nmetalanguage. But this restriction was loosened when Tarski convinced\nhim in 1935 that interpretation could be completely specified by\nexplicit rules governing satisfaction, designation, and truth.\n\nBy this time, the storm clouds gathering in Europe were obvious for\nall to see, and like many of the Vienna Circle, Carnap sought an\nappointment in North America. In 1936 he landed at the University of\nChicago, where he would stay for nearly twenty years, longer than he\nspent anywhere else. While he felt personally and intellectually\ncomfortable in the United States, his written prose was never as\nelegant or forceful in English as it had been in German, and his\npublications were mostly quite technical. The larger context of his\nphilosophy was of course unknown to most colleagues and students, and\nremained obscure to the larger public. This decontextualization of\nlogical empiricism was reinforced by political factors. As new\nimmigrants, Carnap and his Vienna Circle friends felt vulnerable in\nthe United States, and many of them, having previously supported\nsocialist causes in Europe, were kept under observation by the FBI,\nincluding Carnap himself (Reisch 2005). It was thus in their interest\nto play down the larger significance of their philosophical\npreoccupations, and to pose as narrow specialists in technical\nsubjects.\n\nCarnap\u2019s first major publication in English, soon after his\narrival in the United States, was \u201cTestability and\nMeaning\u201d (1936\u201337), discussed in\n sections 1.5\u20136\n above, the first in a series of attempts to explicate\n\u201cempirical content\u201d or \u201cempirical\nreducibility\u201d more loosely than the strict reducibility\nenvisaged in the Aufbau. By the late 1930s, Carnap was\nwilling to countenance a theoretical language whose primitive terms\nare not constructed bottom-up from observation sentences at all but\nentirely top-down, \u201cfloating in the air, so to speak\u201d so\nthat these basic theoretical terms can have \u201conly an\nindirect interpretation, which is incomplete in a certain\nsense\u201d (Carnap 1939: 65). With these steps, Carnap began his\nreturn to a consideration of the theoretical language, which he had\nleft behind during the Vienna years. But his main focus, after\n\u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d, was the semantic framework\nitself. In the slim volume on Foundations of Logic and\nMathematics for the Encyclopedia of Unified Science (1939), the\ntripartite classification of linguistic theory into syntax, semantics,\nand pragmatics was first laid out. A five-volume series of Studies\nin Semantics was projected, of which the first two volumes,\nIntroduction to Semantics and Formalization of Logic\nwere published in 1942\u20133. Carnap then pursued a long-standing\ninterest in modal logic and intensional languages, and published\n\u201cModalities and Quantification\u201d in 1946, Meaning and\nNecessity in 1947. More details on Carnap\u2019s work in\nsemantics can be found in the supplement\n Semantics.\n\nCarnap had embraced semantics in 1935 because Tarski had convinced him\nthat designation and truth could be described and discussed in an\nentirely schematic and objective way, free from any psychological,\nsubjective, or epistemological entanglements or commitments (Carnap\n1936). As we have seen, the return to a schematic form of\n\u201cmeaning\u201d led many to regard Logical Syntax as\noutdated. Carnap himself (e.g., 1942: \u00a739) was careful to deny\nthis, but probably didn\u2019t emphasize enough that the return of\n\u201cmeaning\u201d did not mean a return to an explanatory\nconception of meaning like Russell\u2019s multiple relation theory of\nbelief or Wittgenstein\u2019s picture theory. This abstract and\nschematic approach to meaning disturbed many empiricists, giving them\nthe impression that Carnap had no interest in what actually underlay\nmeaning, i.e., wherein the relation between predicate and property\n(cf. Wilson 1982) actually consists. As B. Russell (1940: 314)\ncomplained, for instance, Carnap ignored \u201ccertain prior\nquestions to be considered\u201d before \u201cthe relation of\nempirical knowledge to non-linguistic occurrences\u201d could be\n\u201cproperly understood\u201d. But these \u201cprior\nquestions\u201d were just the ones Carnap had put aside in 1931\n(Pincock 2007). In this respect there is a seamless continuity in\nCarnap\u2019s \u201cminimalism\u201d with respect to language; even\nwith the embrace of semantics in 1935, these questions remained\nabsent, and only began to make a rather shadowy reappearance with\nCarnap\u2019s (1939) addition of pragmatics (the study of\nlanguage in use) to his conception of language. Semantics abstracts\nfrom use and focuses only on the expressions themselves and their\ndesignata, while syntax abstracts from designata as well (1939:\n3\u20134; 1942: 9).\n\nIn Carnap\u2019s work after 1935, it is important to distinguish\nbetween two different parts of the semantic enterprise. On the one\nhand, there are the repeated attempts to pin down the inferential\nrelations between observation-statements and more general ones\nwithin the general framework of semantics. In this work,\nmeaning and reference are considered particularly as they concern the\nempirical content (or meaning) of general statements, whether\nempirical generalizations or theories of more universal scope. This\nincludes \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d (Carnap 1936\u201337),\nthe later work on the theoretical language (Carnap 1956a, 1959a), and\nmuch of the work on inductive logic (see\n section 8\n below). On the other hand, there is the construction of the semantic\nframework itself, its logical delineation and development; even if\nthis was in principle to serve the first purpose, it became in effect\na distinct project. This includes the Studies in Semantics,\nthe modal logic systems (Carnap 1946), and the later version of his\nlogic textbook, Einf\u00fchrung in die symbolische Logik\n(Carnap 1968b). We discuss this second component in\n section 6.2,\n immediately following, and the first component in\n section 8\n below.\n6.2 Carnap\u2019s New Priorities\n\nThere are two main changes leading from the linguistic frameworks of\nthe Logical Syntax to the \u201csemantic systems\u201d of\nMeaning and Necessity: Carnap took the semantic turn,\nallowing for a relation of reference or designation; and beyond that\nhe allowed for intensional operators which he supplied with a new\nintensional semantics.\n\nFrom Foundations of Logic and Mathematics (1939) (and\nIntroduction to Semantics, 1942) Carnap had taken up\nTarski\u2019s conception of semantic truth. The principle of\ntolerance in the Logical Syntax remained intact, but in the\nfollowing refined form: the syntactic rules of formation can be chosen\nfreely; if the syntactical rules of transformation (derivation,\ninference) are determined prior to the semantic rules, they may be\ndetermined freely as well, but the semantic rules will have to be\nselected such that the transformation rules are sound with respect to\nthem; vice versa, if the semantic rules are chosen prior to\nthe transformation rules, the former may be determined freely, in\nwhich case the latter will need to match the former by being sound\nwith respect to them (see, e.g., section 12 of Carnap 1939).\nCompletely new questions arose, e.g., whether the rules of inference\nof classical propositional logic would determine the semantics of the\nstandard logical connectives uniquely (given certain\nconstraints): this novel type of categoricity question was answered in\nthe negative by Carnap (1943). (In recent years, this part of\nCarnap\u2019s work has sparked a lively debate: see, e.g.,\nRaatikainen 2008, Murzi & Hjortland 2009.) Semantics became just\nas important in Carnap\u2019s work for the construction of formal\nlanguages as syntax had been in the Logical Syntax.\n\nSecondly, Carnap extended Tarski\u2019s extensional semantics by a\nnew intensional one, in which the truth values of sentences with\noperators creating intensional contexts (such as a sentential operator\nfor necessity) can also be determined compositionally. Carnap\u2019s\ninvention of what would become \u201cpossible worlds\nsemantics,\u201d which he showed one could spell out in an\nextensional metalanguage, had a decisive influence on the development\nof modal logic and intensional semantics. Even though there are\nsignificant differences between modern \u201cKripke semantics\u201d\n(which is rightly associated with Saul Kripke\u2019s work),\nCarnap\u2019s intensional semantics is still a possible worlds\nsemantics in the sense that it evaluates formulas at possible worlds\n(\u201cstate-descriptions\u201d in Carnap\u2019s terminology), and\nthe semantic rule for Carnap\u2019s operator \u2018N\u2019\nfor (logical) necessity invokes universal quantification over worlds:\n\\(N(A)\\) holds in state-description s if and only if\nA holds in every state-description (see \u00a741 of\nMeaning and Necessity; the differences and similarities to\nKripke semantics are explained in detail in the supplement\n Semantics (Section 1)).\n On the side of theoretical linguistics, Richard Montague\u2019s\nlater intensional semantics for natural language built on\nCarnap\u2019s semantics (see Partee 2011).\n\nAs discussed in the supplement\n Semantics (Section 2),\n he partially weakened his early radical thesis of extensionality by\nthe time of Meaning and Necessity.\n6.3 Intensional Semantics\n\nThe languages to which Tarski\u2019s semantics applied were\nextensional; Carnap\u2019s semantics extends Tarski\u2019s by\nassigning compositionally to each singular term, each predicate, and\neach sentence both an intension and an extension.\nThe intension of an expression explicates what we understand when we\nunderstand it, and Carnap\u2019s treatment of this is again\n\u201cminimalist\u201d in the sense that nothing subjective or\npsychological is involved; \u201cunderstanding\u201d is entirely\nschematic, i.e., determined solely by semantic rules. The extension of\nan expression at a state-description is determined by applying the\nsemantic rules (or the expression\u2019s intension) to the\nstate-description. In the words of David Lewis (1970: 23):\n\n\nThe plan to construe intensions as extension-determining functions\noriginated with Carnap\u2026 Accordingly, let us call such functions\nCarnapian intensions.\n\n\nA state-description (an idea that derives from the\n\u201cSpielr\u00e4ume\u201d in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus, and more distantly from Leibniz\u2019s idea of\npossible worlds) is simply a set X of sentences for which the\nfollowing is the case: for each atomic sentence in the object\nlanguage, either the sentence or its negation is a member of\nX, but not both; and X only includes atomic\nsentences or negations of atomic sentences. One state-description\ndescribes the \u201cactual state of the universe\u201d (Carnap 1947:\n\u00a72), and how a linguistic expression is evaluated at that\nstate-description recovers the Tarskian extension of the expression.\nIntensions are assigned to linguistic expressions by evaluating them\nat arbitrary state-descriptions.\n\nAccording to Carnap\u2019s setup, two sentences A and\nB have the same intension if and only if the equivalence \\(A\n\\leftrightarrow B\\) is L-true. A sentence is L-true\n(logically true) just in case it holds in in every state-description.\nFor Carnap this definition of L-truth explicates the informal\nidea that a sentence is logically true if it is true in virtue of\nsemantic rules alone without reference to empirical facts. Later,\nCarnap introduced the idea of \u201cmeaning postulates\u201d that\ncould restrict the range of state-descriptions (Carnap 1952) and\nadopted Quine\u2019s terminology by which only those sentences are\n\u201clogically true\u201d whose truth is evident from the logical\nparticles alone, while the larger class of sentences true in all\nstate-descriptions are called \u201canalytic\u201d.\n\nCarnap (1946, 1947) worked out an intensional semantics for necessity\nand possibility operators for different example languages, and for the\nmodal logic S5 that C.I. Lewis (1944) had previously discussed (see\nthe supplement\n Semantics (Section 1)\n for the details). He also started exploring areas that are presently\nof special interest, such as \u201chyperintensional\u201d semantics\n(see, e.g., Yablo 2014): In the context of addressing the paradox of\nanalysis, he found that a stronger or finer-grained notion of synonymy\nwas needed than identity of intension, i.e., L-equivalence,\nand he defined a relation called \u201cintensionally isomorphic\nto\u201d for that purpose. In response to critiques by Benson Mates\nand Leonard Linsky (1949), who pointed out instances of apparent\nsynonymity that were not intensionally isomorphic by Carnap\u2019s\ndefinition, Carnap replied that this just showed that the\nordinary-language conception of \u201csynonymity\u201d is vague, and\nthat actually it conceals a number, perhaps a range, of explicanda;\nfor certain purposes, he agreed, a still stronger (or finer-grained)\nconception of intensionality (and thus synonymity) might be required\n(Carnap 1949).\n\nAlonzo Church used Carnap\u2019s concept of intensional isomorphism\nin his reconstruction of Frege\u2019s notions of sense and reference,\n\u201cA formulation of the logic of sense and denotation\u201d\n(Church 1951), and later also addressed a critique to Carnap directly\n(Church 1954), to which Carnap (1954b) replied. John Myhill (1958) in\na critique of Church\u2019s reconstruction, re-discovered a paradox\nfirst spelled out by Russell in Appendix B of Principles that\nraises precisely the same issue about individuating intensions, and\nsince then the study of Russellian intensional logic, and\nfiner-grained versions of intensional identity, has continued (Church\n1976, 1985; Linsky 1988; Anderson 1989; Cantini 2004; Deutsch\n2014).\n\nCarnap argues in Meaning and Necessity (especially \u00a730)\nthat his method of extension and intension is an improvement over\nFrege\u2019s method of reference and sense, because it preserves the\nextension and intension of a linguistic expression across contexts\n(i.e., regardless of whether they are extensional or intensional\ncontexts), while Frege\u2019s method does not. Before Michael\nDummett\u2019s work on Frege, Carnap\u2019s detailed critical\nengagement with Frege\u2019s theory of sense and reference in this\nbook probably did more to establish Frege as a classic of analytic\nphilosophy than any other single impulse. Not only Church, but many\nothers were inspired not only to reconstruct Frege\u2019s original\nview in a more rigorous way, but to do so in the light of\nCarnap\u2019s challenge and his critique of those views from a modern\npoint of view. Carnap\u2019s intensional semantics is discussed in\nmore detail in the supplement\n Semantics (Section 1).\n7. Quine and \u201cEmpiricism, Semantics, and Ontology\u201d\n\nThe best-known aspect of Carnap\u2019s reflections on semantics,\nhowever, concern his various controversies with Quine, which addressed\na broad range of issues, two of which have aroused particular\ninterest: ontology and \u201cthe\u201d analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. For many years after Quine launched his critique of\nCarnap, in the 1950s, it was widely agreed that Quine had\n\u201cwon\u201d, and for several decades his paper \u201cTwo Dogmas\nof Empiricism\u201d (Quine 1951) became perhaps the best-known and\nmost widely cited paper in all analytic philosophy. However, since the\nrevival of Carnap studies in the 1980s and 90s, the picture looks\nrather different, and if there is a mainstream opinion on the\nCarnap-Quine debates now, it would probably be something like the\nposition articulated in a series of papers by Richard Creath (1987,\n1990, 1991, 1994, 2007, 2009) to the effect that Quine at least\npartially misunderstood Carnap and that the two philosophers were\nlargely talking past each other (while of course trying hard not\nto).\n\nWith respect to reductionism (the second dogma of empiricism in\nQuine\u2019s 1951), Quine rightly criticized the viability of\nCarnap\u2019s radical reductionism in the\nAufbau\u2014which, however, Carnap himself gave up soon\nafter the Aufbau\u2019s publication. It is much less clear\nwhether Quine is right to attribute a weaker form of reductionism to\nthe later Carnap, as Carnap regards the confirmation of scientific\nhypotheses to be holistic and theory-relative from the Logic\nSyntax at the latest. This is discussed in more detail in the\nsupplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 1).\n\nThe other \u201cdogma of empiricism\u201d that Quine discerned in\nCarnap was his adherence to \u201cthe\u201d analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. Unlike Quine, though, Carnap was not primarily interested\nin defining analyticity for natural language, but rather in the\nconstruction of linguistic frameworks for which a coherent notion of\nanalyticity could be defined in precise terms. Nor did Carnap imagine\nthat there was a single unique such distinction; he thought rather\nthat any such distinction had to be language-relative and himself\nconstructed precise definitions of analyticity for a number of\nlinguistic frameworks with different applications. True, Carnap also\nattempted in Syntax to give a general definition of\n\u201canalytic\u201d that would apply to all languages, but\ndid not think even at the time that he had succeeded. He went on\ntrying to find one, but never seriously proposed a solution. So\nQuine\u2019s criticism of Carnap\u2019s lack of definition of\n\u2018analytic-in-language-L\u2019 with variable\n\u2018L\u2019 was definitely sound, but it ran in open doors, as\nCarnap had never claimed to have supplied such a definition even to\nhis own satisfaction. It is a matter of ongoing debate, though,\nwhether Quine\u2019s concerns somehow undermined Carnap\u2019s\ndefinitions of analyticity for particular formal frameworks\nand whether these constructed and language-relative notions of\nanalyticity (the existence of which was of course acknowledged by\nQuine) satisfied the conceptual role that Carnap ascribed to them. In\nany case, Carnap himself did not think that every language had to have\nanalytic sentences. Most sophisticated language frameworks, especially\nthose equipped for scientific statements, would need them, since the\nanalytic sentences are just those that \u201ccome with\u201d the\nframework (by being provable by the rules of the framework without\nfurther assumptions), but it is possible, Carnap thought, to design a\nlanguage that has no analytic sentences. (In terms of a modern\nanalogy: there are systems of non-classical logic, such as\nthree-valued Strong-Kleene logic, which include an interesting and\nwell-defined logical consequence relation, but where the set of\nlogically true statements is empty.) He did not think this worth\npursuing, though, since to him it was obvious that such a language\nwould not be scientifically useful. He often cited Einstein\u2019s\n(1921) insistence that without Hilbert\u2019s strict distinction\nbetween physical geometry and mathematical \u201cpurely\naxiomatic\u201d geometry (the latter of which was regarded as\nanalytic by Carnap), Einstein could never have formulated the theory\nof relativity.\n\nThe debate between Carnap and Quine about analytic and synthetic has\nproduced a flood of commentary, which is still being added to (see,\ne.g., Juhl & Loomis 2010 or Ebbs 2017 for recent discussions,\nProust 1986 [1989] for a broader historical perspective). The main\npoints of the controversy, the main commentators, and Carnap\u2019s\nown view of the matter are discussed in more detail in\n Carnap vs Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction.\n\nOn the subject of ontology, Quine criticized Carnap\u2019s use of\nquantifiers over intensional entities in Carnap\u2019s intensional\nsemantics. Closely related criticisms were voiced by many others,\nespecially including Carnap\u2019s own former Vienna colleague Otto\nNeurath and the Oxford philosopher Gilbert Ryle, whose review of\nMeaning and Necessity (Ryle 1949) was perhaps the nastiest\nand most vituperative review ever written of anything Carnap wrote.\nCarnap responded (calmly) with his well-known paper \u201cEmpiricism,\nSemantics, and Ontology\u201d (1950a), in which he distinguished\nbetween two understandings of \u201cexistence\u201d attributions,\ninternal and external. Internal ones are framework-relative;\nthey specify a language framework before claiming or denying or\nquestioning the existence of a thing. External existence\nclaims or questions lack such a relativization to a framework. For\nCarnap only internal questions make sense, if you take them literally.\nThus \u201care there infinitely many numbers?\u201d makes sense if\nyou relativize it to a framework such as, for instance,\nZermelo-Frankel set theory\u2014which has an axiom of infinity, so\nthe answer is (trivially) yes. But without such a relativization the\nquestion makes no sense to Carnap\u2014unless, that is, you\nreinterpret it as a practical (normative) question of\ndeciding among frameworks or explications. All of this applies, in\nparticular, to the quantification over abstract entities in a\nframework for semantics, such as intensional semantics. In turn, Quine\nrejected Carnap\u2019s internal/external distinction, which for Quine\nrelied on the analytic/synthetic distinction, as accepting a framework\nwould consist in accepting the sentences that are analytic in the\nframework. Whether the ontological internal/external distinction needs\nto build on the semantic analytic/synthetic distinction has itself\nbecome a topic in recent philosophical work on metaphysical\ndeflationism about existence questions, which takes Carnap\u2019s\nmetaontological views as its historical starting point (see, e.g.,\nThomasson 2014; see the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology (Sections 2 and 3)\n for further discussion).\n8. Inductive Logic and the Re-Emergence of the Theoretical Language\n8.1 Confirmation\n\nCarnap\u2019s first sketch of a linguistic framework (that of the\nAufbau) envisaged complete reducibility of all concepts by\nexplicit definition, at least in principle. By the time of\n\u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d (1936\u201337), as we saw\nabove, Carnap had conceded that such definitional reducibility is not\nalways possible, and suggested various forms of incomplete\nreducibility that, while not employing only explicit definitions, at\nleast required of empirically meaningful sentences a clear grounding\nin observation. He considers verifiability as a criterion for\nempirical content or meaning, and rejects it for essentially the same\nreason as he had a decade previously (in Carnap 1926: 7\u20139). He\nalso considers Popper\u2019s falsifiability criterion, and rejects it\nbecause only sentences of a very particular logical form are\nfalsifiable at all (such as, e.g., \u201call swans are white\u201d).\nIndeed, most scientific theories (all theories that use limit\nconcepts, for instance) have to be stated using unbounded multiple\nmixed quantifiers, e.g., \u201cfor all x there is a\ny such that \\((\\ldots x \\ldots y\\ldots)\\)\u201d, and there\nare instances of such sentences which can neither be verified nor\nfalsified by a single observational counter-instance. In\nparticular, to falsify such a statement there would have to be a\ncounter-instance x to falsify an unbounded existentially\nquantified (empirical) sentence, which (as Popper himself\nacknowledged) is not generally possible. So in these cases, typical of\ntheoretical science, falsifiability has no advantage over\nverifiability. (For a more precise discussion of falsifiability, see\nSchurz & Dorn 1988.)\n\nCarnap therefore opts neither for verification nor for falsification,\nbut for a form of partial verification that he calls\n\u201cconfirmation\u201d:\n\n\nIf in the continued series of such testing experiments no negative\ninstance is found but the number of positive instances increases, then\nour confidence in the law will grow step by step. Thus, instead of\nverification, we may speak of gradually increasing\nconfirmation of the law. (TM1: 425)\n\n\nThe acceptance or rejection of a scientific hypothesis becomes\npartially a practical matter, and to some degree a matter of\nconvention. Carnap speaks in this connection of the \u201cdegree of\nconfirmation\u201d but means this not in a quantitative but merely\n\u201ctopological\u201d (what he would later call\n\u201ccomparative\u201d) sense. He specifically rejects\nReichenbach\u2019s proposal to equate degree of confirmation to\n\u201cthe degree of probability in the strict sense which this\nconcept has in the calculus of probability, i.e., as the limit of\nrelative frequency\u201d (TM1: 427). Five years later Carnap would\nrealize that the probability calculus could be given a different,\nepistemic interpretation as had been done historically by Bayes,\nLaplace, Pearson, and Keynes, and was now continued by Harold\nJeffreys\u2014and he would make that interpretation the basis of his\nremaining life\u2019s work of developing quantitative\nexplications of \u201cdegree of confirmation\u201d. (For more\ndetails on Carnap\u2019s work on confirmation and inductive logic,\nsee the supplement\n Inductive Logic.)\n8.2 Inductive Logic\n\nWhy did Carnap decide to change directions so radically, at the age of\n52? This is unusual in a philosopher, especially as in Carnap\u2019s\ncase it involved reading his way into a whole new field of inquiry, as\nwell as learning a whole new branch of mathematics. We know that the\nidea of a \u201cdegree of confirmation\u201d had interested him\nsince at least the time of \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d. At\nthis time, as we saw in\n section 8.1\n above, he thought it could be defined only comparatively, since he\nrejected Reichenbach\u2019s conflation of truth-value with frequency\nas well as his identification of relative frequency and confirmation\n(Carnap 1935b, 1936\u201337). And it had been the accepted wisdom in\nthe Vienna Circle that the classical (epistemic) interpretation of\nprobability had been entirely superseded by the frequency\ninterpretation, partly because the latter relied on Laplace\u2019s\nmuch-criticized principle of indifference, which they classified as\nmetaphysical. Even Keynes (1921) had given insufficiently clear\narguments and his axioms were defective, they thought, but there was\ninterest in Wittgenstein\u2019s logical (purely analytic) conception\nof probability, suggested in the Tractatus, and developed in\nmore detail by Waismann (1930).\n\nThen in 1937, right after \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d,\nCarnap was sent the typescript of Reichenbach\u2019s Experience\nand Prediction for evaluation by the University of Chicago Press.\nIn a long letter to Reichenbach he takes him to task for exaggerating\nthe drawbacks of what Reichenbach chastises as the \u201cdisparity\nconception\u201d of probability, whereby the \u201cweight\u201d (or\n\u201cdegree of confirmation\u201d as Carnap also calls it) and\nprobability (understood as relative frequency) are two separate\n(disparate) things. Reichenbach had gone so far in his submitted\ndraft, apparently, as to claim that the disparity conception was not\nonly the root of all philosophical error, but a form of metaphysics.\nCarnap says that he himself is not sure what side he is on regarding\nthe disparity conception (and there is no reason to doubt this, in\n1937, as far as we know), but he thinks both its acceptance and its\nrejection are perfectly compatible with empiricism, and advises\nReichenbach to tone down his rhetoric.\n\nThough he was open-minded about the \u201cdisparity conception\u201d\nduring this period, it was only in the spring of 1941, according to\nCarnap\u2019s autobiography, that he \u201cbegan to reconsider the\nwhole problem of probability\u201d (1963a: 72). He re-read\nKeynes\u2019s book more carefully, and found it very enlightening\n(ibid.). He began to develop a new conception of confirmation,\ninfluenced by both Waismann and Keynes:\n\n\nBut I tried a new approach. I believed that the logical concept of\nprobability should supply an exact quantitative explication of a\nconcept which is basic in the methodology of empirical science, viz.\nthe concept of the confirmation of a hypothesis. (1963a: 72)\n\n\nThe starting point of Carnap\u2019s new inductive logic was, first of\nall, precisely Reichenbach\u2019s \u201cdisparity\nconception\u201d\u2014i.e., to distinguish very clearly between two\ndifferent explicata of the ordinary-language word\n\u201cprobability\u201d. One was relative frequency, which is an\nempirical matter, and was held up as the only acceptable\ninterpretation of the Kolmogorov probability calculus by frequentists\nsuch as von Mises, Reichenbach, and (classically) Ronald Fisher. The\nother was epistemic probability, which Keynes and Harold Jeffreys held\nto be the only acceptable interpretation. Carnap called them\n\u201cprobability2\u201d and\n\u201cprobability1\u201d respectively, and set about\nclearing the ground for an explication of the latter, without casting\nany doubt on the legitimacy of \u201cprobability2\u201d\nas an empirical tool. This distinction was the main focus of\nCarnap\u2019s first article on inductive logic (Carnap 1945a).\n\nThe conception he developed in his next article (Carnap 1945b) was\nindeed logical in the Wittgenstein-Waismann sense, in that the\nrelation between observation sentences and hypothesis was purely\nlogical and analytic. To achieve this, a relativized principle of\nindifference was needed; unlike that of Laplace or Keynes,\nCarnap\u2019s was entirely language-relative (framework-relative); it\nwas no longer a quasi-metaphysical assertion about the nature of\ndistributions, let alone about the statistical nature of the world,\nbut a matter of constitutive definition. As in any other area of\nknowledge, Carnap thought it essential to define the framework before\nmaking assertions, so that we are all on the same page. (This logical\nor \u201cstructural\u201d conception of probability and the\nrelativized principle of indifference are explained in concrete detail\nin the supplement\n Inductive Logic.)\n This means that the value of a confirmation measure as applied to a\nhypothesis and the evidence for or against it is an analytical\nconsequence (in the chosen language framework) of the logical and\ninductive method given by the framework.\n\nIn 1950, Carnap published what would be longest book of his career by\nfar, the Logical Foundations of Probability, into which he\nworked these two papers (much expanded) and several others, and also\nwent into great detail to bring a number of perspectives to bear on\nthe clarification of the explicanda of \u201cprobability\u201d and\n\u201cconfirmation\u201d (both in the sense of\nprobability1). He also goes into detail to discuss ways of\narriving at axioms, and to motivate the choices he ends up with. In\nthe course of these clarifications he addresses a number of\nphilosophical issues surrounding induction, confirmation, and\nscientific inference. A simpler exposition than Carnap himself gave of\nhis inductive logic project was given later by Kemeny (1963). See the\nsupplement\n Inductive Logic\n for further details.\n\nCarnap\u2019s inductive logic encountered a wide range of criticisms,\ne.g., that of Hilary Putnam, whose philosophical development had been\nstrongly influenced by regular meetings with Carnap at Princeton in\nthe 1950s. Putnam criticized the general idea of an algorithmic\naccount of the inductive confirmation of scientific hypothesis by\nevidence (as exemplified by the special confirmation measure \\(c^*\\)\nthat is described in the appendix of Carnap 1950b), while at the same\ntime laying the foundations of what would become formal learning\ntheory (see Putnam 1963 and the concluding section of the\nsupplement\n Inductive Logic).\n But perhaps the biggest obstacle to a better and more widespread\nunderstanding of Carnap\u2019s inductive logic was the memorable\ncaricature of Carnap\u2019s whole enterprise by Karl Popper in his\nattacks on Carnap during the 1950s and 1960s (e.g., Popper 1963).\nThese were so convincing that the philosophical public retained only\nthe caricature and hardly bothered to consult the original. In other\nwords, the same pattern repeated itself that we have already seen with\nrespect to the Quine-Carnap controversies of the 1950s and 60s\n (section 7\n above)\u2014for a long time, the general philosophical public\nretained only one side of the debate, influenced mainly by\nQuine\u2019s (and then Popper\u2019s) superior rhetorical skills, as\na result of which both Quine and Popper were much more widely read\nthan Carnap (though Quine\u2019s proximity to traditional American\npragmatism surely also played a role). The difference between these\ncases is that Popper, unlike Quine, actually misrepresented\nCarnap\u2019s position quite blatantly, as Carnap\u2019s supporters\n(e.g., Bar-Hillel 1955, 1956; Kemeny 1955, 1963) were quick to point\nout. (Michalos 1971 gives a well-informed, brief, but balanced survey\nof the Popper-Carnap controversy.)\n\nStatisticians (and statistically literate philosophers) have been\nquicker to acknowledge not only the continuity between Carnap\u2019s\ninductive logic and the present-day renaissance of Bayesian\nstatistical inference, but Carnap\u2019s role in bringing epistemic\nprobability back from the dead and ensuring that it was taken\nseriously again (e.g., Leblanc 1962; Skyrms 1996; Zabell 2007, 2011).\nMany of the standard features of current Bayesianism were first\nformulated in Carnap\u2019s Logical Foundations and in his\nsubsequent work. Carnap went on working on inductive logic for another\n20 years after Logical Foundations; his final statement (the\n\u201cBasic System\u201d), in which prior probabilities depended on\ngeometrical \u201cquality space\u201d features of the given\nframework, appeared after his death in two long installments, edited\nby his friend and associate Richard Jeffrey (Carnap 1971a, 1980; for\nan extensive discussion of the \u201cBasic System\u201d, see\nHilpinen 1973, Sznajder 2017). His later work appeared to move in a\nmore \u201cpersonalist\u201d direction (though see Sznajder 2018),\nbut Carnap continued to insist that the prior probability from which a\nstatistical inference proceeds be motivated rationally (by\nconsiderations of symmetry) and not be merely subjective;\nhere he stuck to his original idea of the relation between evidence\nand hypothesis being purely analytic and thus framework-relative.\nThough this distinguishes his standpoint from current subjective\nBayesians, there are and have been many other kinds of Bayesians that\nare reasonably close to Carnap\u2019s views, including\n\u201cobjective\u201d Bayesians (e.g., Jaynes 1968, J. Williamson\n2010). (For more on Carnap\u2019s relation to current Bayesianism and\nvarious discussions of it today, see the supplement\n Inductive Logic.)\n As one prominent Bayesian pointed out in 1971, one can distinguish at\nleast 46,656 possible varieties of Bayesians (Good 1971), and Zabell\n(a later prominent Bayesian) thinks Carnap would surely qualify for\ninclusion among these. Zabell also cites a characteristically\nconciliatory passage from Carnap\u2019s posthumous \u201cBasic\nSystem\u201d that sums up Carnap\u2019s appraisal of the\nsituation:\n\n\nI think there need not be a controversy between the objectivist point\nof view and the subjectivist or personalist point of view. Both have a\nlegitimate place in the context of our work, that is, the construction\nof a set of rules for determining probability values with respect to\npossible evidence. At each step in the construction, a choice is to be\nmade; the choice is not completely free but is restricted by certain\nboundaries. Basically there is merely a difference in attitude or\nemphasis between the subjectivist tendency to emphasize the existing\nfreedom of choice, and the objectivist tendency to stress the\nexistence of limitations. (Carnap 1980: 119, quoted by Zabell 2007:\n294)\n\n8.3 Return to the Theoretical Language\n\nAs we saw in\n section 6.1,\n by the late 1930s Carnap had returned to a consideration of\ntheoretical languages whose primitive terms are not constructed\nbottom-up from observation sentences at all but entirely top-down,\n\u201cfloating in the air, so to speak\u201d so that these basic\ntheoretical terms can have \u201conly an indirect\ninterpretation, which is incomplete in a certain sense\u201d\n(Carnap 1939: 65). In Carnap\u2019s mind, the question of\nconfirmation of theories and the question of the empirical content of\ntheories were directly and inseparably connected, as they had been in\n\u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d. In this subsequent work on\nthese two questions, however, they were pursued separately, and for\nall of Carnap\u2019s efforts, the two strands could not be joined up.\nHis inductive logic was never able to assign a degree of confirmation\nother than zero to unrestricted universally quantified theories, which\nwas obviously a defect of the theory and was seized upon by Popper as\ndiscrediting the entire enterprise (e.g., Popper 1963). Carnap\u2019s\nown way around the problem was to argue that scientists often regard\nthe degree by which a piece of evidence E confirms a\nuniversal law hypothesis \\(\\forall x P(x)\\) to be given by the degree\nto which E confirms an \u201carbitrary\u201d instance of\nthe law \\(P(a)\\), where a is an individual constant that does\nnot occur in E: see Carnap (1945b: \u00a714). Later authors\ntried to repair the defect in alternative ways, with varying degrees\nof success; see the supplement\n Inductive Logic.\n On the other hand, though Carnap\u2019s work on the empirical\ncontent of sentences in a theoretical language often discusses the\nrelations between observational language and theoretical language, he\nwas never quite able to spell out a criterion for empirically\nmeaningful sentences in the theoretical language that did not fall\nprey to fairly straightforward criticism (e.g., Kaplan 1975). The\ngrand design of connecting up the projects of explicating confirmation\nand of reconstructing scientific theoretical language remained a\ndistant goal.\n\nWe have already surveyed the inductive-logic side in the previous\n section 8.2.\n On the theoretical-language side, Carnap\u2019s first major paper\nwas \u201cThe methodological character of theoretical concepts\u201d\n(Carnap 1956a), followed by \u201cObservation language and\ntheoretical language\u201d (Carnap 1958) and \u201cTheoretical\nconcepts in science\u201d (1959a). Carnap also touches on theoretical\nlanguages in several parts of the Schilpp volume (1963).\nPhilosophical Foundations of Physics (1966), finally, is a\nredaction by Martin Gardner of a class Carnap gave at UCLA in the late\n1950s, presented as an introductory textbook in the philosophy of\nscience. Among other things, it gives a lucid summary of\nCarnap\u2019s mature views on the reconstruction of scientific\ntheories. See the supplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Sections 3\u20135)\n for details and criticism.\n\nOne common misunderstanding of Carnap\u2019s work on the theoretical\nlanguage is an extension of the above-discussed misunderstandings of\nthe Aufbau\n (section 3\n above). The Aufbau was traditionally perceived as an\nexercise in providing phenomenalist or empiricist foundations for\nscientific sentences. Therefore, it was assumed, the later work on\nboth inductive logic and the theoretical language must be motivated by\nthe aim of providing empiricist foundations for scientific sentences,\nto distinguish them from non-scientific, i.e., metaphysical sentences.\nThis was certainly Popper\u2019s view, for instance, and largely\nQuine\u2019s, but they were not alone; it was widespread until the\n1990s, when the new and more careful scholarship about logical\nempiricism began to take hold.\n\nIt is true, of course, that in Carnap\u2019s later work on scientific\ntheories and theoretical languages, he distinguishes between a\ntheoretical language and an observation language, and studied the\nrelations between them. What is often overlooked, though, is that even\nin the Aufbau (and even in the earliest proto-Aufbau\nmanuscripts) Carnap was very clear that what we are to take as\n\u201cthe given\u201d is not inherently fixed or given by\nnature (as Aristotle would have put it), but something we have to\ndecide on, something we have to specify provisionally in our\nchosen form of rational reconstruction. Later Carnap became even\nclearer that what we choose to regard as \u201cobservation\nsentences\u201d is purpose-relative and can\u2019t be decided once\nfor all contexts, in the abstract. As early as \u201cTestability and\nMeaning\u201d (TM1: \u00a716) Carnap was saying that \u201cthere can\nbe several and even mutually exclusive bases\u201d for confirmation\nby observation. And in later work on the theoretical language this\npluralism is extended; in \u201cThe methodological character of\ntheoretical concepts\u201d he merely enumerates various possible\nrequirements of different kinds and strengths that might be imposed on\nthe observation language.\n\nIn Carnap\u2019s view, the choice of the theoretical language depends\non the purpose. The boundary between \u201cobservational\u201d and\n\u201ctheoretical\u201d terms, likewise, is relative to the language\nchosen and not fixed by nature:\n\n\nno sharp boundary separates the O-terms from the\nT-terms. The choice of an exact dividing line is somewhat\narbitrary. From a practical point of view, however, the distinction is\nusually evident. (Carnap 1966: 258)\n\n\nObservational terms are assumed to be fully interpreted; their\nspecification comes with an explicit link to observation (precisely\ndefined in some way), while theoretical terms are specified\naxiomatically and are, in the first instance, uninterpreted or only\nmathematically interpreted formulas. These formulas can then be\nendowed with physical (or chemical, or biological, or social)\ninterpretations by means of correspondence rules, which logically\nrelate observation terms and theoretical terms.\n\nCarnap\u2019s views on the theoretical language during this period\ndeveloped in response to critiques and commentaries from (as well as\npersonal correspondence with) C.G. Hempel (1945, 1958, 1963). One\nresponse to these interactions was Carnap\u2019s adoption of an idea\nfirst suggested by Frank Ramsey (1929) for the purpose of separating\nthe theoretical from the empirical content of a theory; this idea\nfirst appeared in print in (the original German version of)\nCarnap\u2019s paper \u201cObservation language and theoretical\nlanguage\u201d (1958). (This procedure is explained in detail in the\nsupplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Sections 4\u20136).)\n The idea was that a theory could essentially be stated in such a way\nthat all the theoretical terms in it are eliminated, i.e., it could be\nstated solely in terms of its \u201cempirical residue\u201d. But\nCarnap\u2019s goal in adopting this method was not to suggest that\nthe theoretical language was eliminable, that theoretical terms could\nor should be eliminated (as some versions of traditional empiricism\nmight have liked). The point was rather to understand the empirical\ncontent of theoretical claims, and its logical function within\ntheories. This leads to many complications, which are still very much\nunder discussion (e.g., Demopoulos 2007, Friedman 2011, Schurz\n2005).\n\nThe Ramsey approach was adopted, following Carnap, by others, notably\nDavid Lewis (1970), who put it to a rather different, more\nmetaphysical use that was later adopted by Frank Jackson and other\nadvocates of the \u201cCanberra Plan\u201d of conceptual analysis.\nThis was also Chalmers\u2019s (2012) point of departure, in his more\nmetaphysical adaptation of the Aufbau, mentioned above\n (section 3).\n See the supplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 4).\n9. Final Years and Legacy\n\nIn 1951, Herbert Feigl approached Paul Schilpp, the editor of the\nLibrary of Living Philosophers, about doing a volume not on a\nparticular philosopher, but on logical empiricism as a movement.\nCarnap and Reichenbach were to be in the foreground, as representative\nfigures for the movement as a whole. Schilpp was sufficiently\ninterested that he persisted with the idea even after\nReichenbach\u2019s sudden death in 1953; the volume was now to be\nfocused on Carnap alone. Carnap invested a great deal of time in the\nproject. He took the task of writing an autobiography seriously,\nreviewing many of his old papers, including his extensive diaries, in\npreparation for it. The resulting autobiography was much too long, and\nhad to be cut by a third before publication. (The cut portions are\navailable at the Young Research Library, University of California at\nLos Angeles, Special Collections, Collection 1029 (Rudolf Carnap), Box\n2, CM3, mostly in folder marked \u201cM-A5\u201d; extensive\nquotations and references can be found in Carus 2007a.)\n\nUnfortunately, publication was delayed by a series of mishaps, and\nwhen the book finally appeared in 1963, logical empiricism was no\nlonger at the forefront of interest. Analytic philosophers had largely\nbeen swayed by Quine\u2019s critique of Carnap over the past decade,\nand philosophers of science were captivated by Thomas Kuhn\u2019s\nbook The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, published the\nyear before in the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science,\nco-edited by Carnap. Logical empiricism no longer inspired passions,\neither for or against; it seemed to belong to the past. Carnap saw in\nthe anti-war and student movements of the 1960s an American version of\nthe Youth Movement that had played such an important role in his own\ndevelopment half a century earlier, but insofar as the students of the\n1960s were interested in philosophy, it was not in logical empiricism.\nA few weeks before his death, Carnap prepared a report for an American\nPhilosophical Association committee about his meeting in the summer of\n1970 with some philosophers imprisoned in Mexico. It illustrates his\ncontinued interest in social and political matters and in his fellow\nphilosophers, and appeared posthumously, in December of that year, in\nthe Journal of Philosophy. When Carnap died in Los Angeles in\n1970, the philosophical world at large (as opposed to the major\nfigures whose views he had shaped, such as Quine, Goodman, Putnam,\nJeffrey, or Stein) had lost interest in him. But half a century later,\nit is fair to say that Carnap\u2019s work is as much in the\nforeground of philosophical discussion as it has ever been.\n10.
