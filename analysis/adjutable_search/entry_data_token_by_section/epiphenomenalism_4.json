    "main_text": "Traditional Arguments (B) Con (with Epiphenomenalists\u2019 Responses) || Self-stultification\n2.4 Self-stultification\n\nThe most powerful reason for rejecting epiphenomenalism is the view\nthat it is incompatible with knowledge of our own minds \u2014 and\nthus, incompatible with knowing that epiphenomenalism is true. (A\nvariant has it that we cannot even succeed in referring to our own\nminds, if epiphenomenalism is true. See Bailey 2006 for this\nobjection and Robinson 2012 for discussion.) If these destructive\nclaims can be substantiated, then epiphenomenalists are, at the very\nleast, caught in a practical contradiction, in which they must claim\nto know, or at least believe, a view which implies that they can have\nno reason to believe it. Moreover, unless epiphenomenalists can\nconsistently claim to know their own minds, they cannot offer the\nresponse to the other minds objection given in 2.3 above. (See Walton,\n1989.) (Many authors give some version of this objection. For a full\nstatement of this argument, and several others concerning\nepiphenomenalism, see Chalmers 1996. For strong recent versions, see\nDeBrigard 2014; Moore 2012 (responded to by Robinson 2013); and\nMoore 2014. For recent discussion see Baysan 2021.)\n\nThe argument that is given to support the destructive claims is that\n(i) knowledge of one\u2019s mental events requires that these events\ncause one\u2019s knowledge, but (ii) epiphenomenalism denies physical\neffects of mental events. So, either we cannot know our own mental\nevents, or our knowledge of them cannot be what is causing the plainly\nphysical event of our saying something about our mental events. Thus,\nsuppose \\(S\\) is an epiphenomenalist, and that \\(S\\) utters \u201cI\nam in terrible pain.\u201d \\(S\\) is committed to the view that the\npain does not cause the utterance. But then, it seems, \\(S\\) would be\nmaking the same utterance whether or not a pain were occurring. If\nthis is so, then \\(S\\)\u2019s testimonies about \\(S\\)\u2019s own\npains are worthless \u2014 both to us and to \\(S\\). They cannot be\ntaken to represent any knowledge about pains on \\(S\\)\u2019s part (if\n\\(S\\)\u2019s epiphenomenalist view is true). In fact, on an\nepiphenomenalist view, all the arguments for epiphenomenalism and\nrebuttals to counterarguments we have reviewed might be given even if\nwe were all zombies \u2014 i.e., even if we were all possessed of\nphysical causes of our utterances and completely devoid of any mental\nlife whatsoever.\n\nThe argument that epiphenomenalism is self-stultifying in the way just\ndescribed rests on the premise that knowledge of a mental event\nrequires causation by that mental event. But epiphenomenalists may\nreject that premise without absurdity. One way of seeing how to do\nthis involves considering the interactionist diagram in Figure 2,\nwhich shows \\(P_1\\) as directly causing \\(M\\) but not \\(P_2\\), and\n\\(M\\) directly causing \\(P_2\\). (Directly causing is an intransitive\nrelation. Causation (when used without modifier) is transitive: events\nare causally related if there is a chain of direct causes, however\nlong, that connects them.)\n\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\nM & & & & & & \\\\\n \\uparrow & \\searrow & & & & & \\\\\n P_1 & & P_2 & \\rightarrow & P_3 & \\rightarrow & \\cdots \n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nNow consider \\(P_3\\), which is directly caused by \\(P_2\\) and which we\nwill assume to cause (directly or indirectly) further behavior such as\n\\(S\\)\u2019s utterance of \u201cI am in terrible pain\u201d.\n\\(P_3\\) is not directly caused by \\(M\\). Does it convey knowledge of\n\\(M\\)? If we answer negatively, on the ground that \\(P_3\\) is not\ndirectly caused by \\(M\\), we will be rejecting interactionism for\nvirtually the same reason that epiphenomenalism is thought to be\nunacceptable. Since this is an extremely implausible stance, let us\ntake it that \\(P_3\\) does convey knowledge of \\(M\\). But what property\ndoes \\(P_3\\) actually have that makes it a case of conveying knowledge\nof \\(M\\)? Epiphenomenalists will wish to point out that \\(P_3\\) does\nnot have any property that contains information as to how it was\ncaused. Looking backward from \\(P_3\\), so to speak, one cannot tell\nwhether it was indirectly caused by \\(M\\) (as in the interactionistic\nFigure 2) or indirectly caused by \\(M\\)\u2019s cause (as in the\nepiphenomenalistic Figure 1). There is, however, a property that\n\\(P_3\\) does have that is intuitively strongly connected to its\nconveying knowledge of \\(M\\) \u2014 namely, that it would not be\noccurring unless \\(M\\) had recently occurred. But \\(P_3\\) has this\nproperty on epiphenomenalist and interactionist views alike. Thus, if\nnot occurring unless \\(M\\) has recently occurred is the property that\nis responsible for \\(P_3\\)\u2019s conveying knowledge of \\(M\\),\nepiphenomenalists have as much right as anyone to claim that \\(P_3\\)\nconveys knowledge of \\(M\\), and they are not debarred from knowing\nwhat they claim to know.\n\nCritics of epiphenomenalism can of course point out that there is a\nproperty that interactionism, but not epiphenomenalism, assigns to\n\\(P_3\\) \u2014 namely, the property of being indirectly caused by\n\\(M\\). Epiphenomenalists, however, are likely to think that the\nintuitive connection between this property and knowledge is much\nweaker than that between knowledge of \\(M\\) and the fact that \\(P_3\\)\nwould not be occurring unless \\(M\\) had recently occurred. In fact,\nthey may hold that the relevance of indirect causation is exhausted by\nits ensuring that \\(P_3\\) would not occur unless \\(M\\) had recently\noccurred. They can then reiterate that there is another way of\nensuring that this condition holds, namely, the set of relations,\ndiagrammed in Fig. 1, that is affirmed by epiphenomenalism.\n\nThe foregoing way of responding to the self-stultification argument is\nfurther explained and defended in Robinson (1982b, 2013; see also\n2006a). An alternative response can be found in Chalmers 1996 (see\nalso Nagasawa 2010). Chalmers\u2019s property-dualistic view holds\nthat there is more to a person than just a brain and a body. It allows\nfor persons to be directly acquainted with experiences, and it is this\ndirect acquaintance, rather than any causal relation, that justifies\nour beliefs about experiences. On this view, experiences are partially\nconstitutive of beliefs about experiences, and \u201cthe\njustification of my belief [about experiences] accrues not just in\nvirtue of my physical features but in virtue of some of my nonphysical\nfeatures \u2014 namely the experiences themselves\u201d (Chalmers\n1996, p. 198). In supplying non-causal relations to support the claim\nto knowledge of experiences, this view disconnects the knowledge\nquestion from the question of how things stand causally, and thus\navoids the self-stultification argument.\n\nA third response to self-stultification begins with the observation\nthat terms for sensory qualities (words for colors, flavors, pitches\nand timbres, etc.) must be learned. Very plausibly, this learning\ndepends (a) on correlations between properties of present objects and\nproduction of words for those properties by surrounding adult\nspeakers; and, consequently, (b) on correlations between brain event\ntypes that are caused by the properties of those objects, and brain\nevent types that are caused by the hearing of adults\u2019 words. It\nalso plausibly depends (c) on the brain\u2019s sensitivity to the\ncorrelation of brain events in (b). It is part of epiphenomenalist\ntheory that the first brain events mentioned in (b) include causes of\nsensations of characteristic kinds, and that, after learning, those\nsame brain events causally determine the production of predicates in\nsensation reports. The combination of these relations ensures that, so\nlong as conditions in the brain are normal, a report of a sensation is\nguaranteed to correctly identify the kind of sensation that is\nnormally caused in the speaker by objects that are standardly\ndescribed by the predicate in the report. This guarantee underwrites a\nclaim to knowledge of what kinds of sensation we are having.\n\nConditions may, of course, sometimes be abnormal. But that cannot be a\ndefeater for epiphenomenalist knowledge of our sensations, because all\nviews must allow for the possibility of cognitive breakdowns such as\nunnoticed slips of the tongue or linguistic difficulties brought on by\ndisease.\n\nIn a 2006 paper, Michael Pauen has given a particularly persuasive\nargument that offers a new and deeper twist to the problem of what\nepiphenomenalists can consistently claim to know about qualia.\nPauen\u2019s focus is on the epiphenomenalists\u2019 claim that\nthere are laws linking the occurrence of neural events of certain\nkinds with occurrences of qualitative events. Since epiphenomenalists\ndeny the identity of qualia and physical properties, such laws are not\nonly contingent, but independent of physical laws. Thus,\nepiphenomenalists must concede the possibility of worlds in which the\nphysical laws are as they are here, but there are no laws connecting\nphysical events to qualitative events. If such worlds are possible, we\nmight actually be in such a world, and so the epiphenomenalist can be\nasked to provide evidence that we are not in such a world. But the\nepiphenomenalist denial of efficacy for qualia precludes the\npossibility of providing any such evidence. Even conceding that we\nknow at each moment what qualia we are having, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that our memories seem to tell us of qualitative events\nthat never occurred (or that were of different kinds than we seem to\nremember); yet we would have to rely on such memories in order to have\nevidence of causal laws holding between physical and qualitative\nevents. (Another argument that turns on memory is given in Swinburne\n2011.)\n\nAlexander Staudacher (2006) has given a critical discussion of\nPauen\u2019s paper. Among several points, perhaps the strongest is a\ncomparison between Pauen\u2019s challenge and the challenge to prove\nI am not a brain in a vat. Inability to decisively answer this latter\nchallenge is not generally taken to impugn our knowledge concerning\ntables and chairs, nor are physicists expected to lay it to rest\nbefore proceeding with their science. Analogously, it may be that\nworlds without causal laws are not \u201crelevant alternatives\u201d\nfor epiphenomenalism, i.e., not alternatives that epiphenomenalists\nare fairly required to rule out. Staudacher points out that if we are\nallowed to raise skeptical challenges of the kind Pauen raises, it\nwill be possible to construct analogous, unanswerable skeptical\nchallenges for interactionism. And, although Staudacher does not\nprovide an analogous case for physicalism, it seems that parallel\ndifficulties are constructable. For example, according to physicalism,\nit would seem to be a conceptual possibility that qualia are\nidentical, not with neural properties, but with a combination of\nneural properties and phases of the Moon, while memory traces depend\nonly on neural properties. For reasons parallel to Pauen\u2019s, it\nseems we could never have evidence that would rule this possibility\nout. But it is not clear that physicalists need to admit the necessity\nof providing evidence against such a view, in order to responsibly\naffirm their view. If that is right, parallel reasoning may be able to\nsupport Staudacher\u2019s way of resisting the force of Pauen\u2019s\nchallenge.\n\nJ. Megill (2007) has raised a problem for epiphenomenalism based on\nthe assumption that properties must be individuated by their causal\nrelations. Since epiphenomenalists deny efficacy to phenomenal\nqualities, the only causal relations to which they could appeal to\nindividuate them would be causes of events with those qualities.\nHowever, different causes may produce the same effect. Thus, appeal to\ndifference of causes alone is an insufficient basis for individuation\nof phenomenal qualities.\n\nEpiphenomenalists can be expected to deny the necessity of causal\nrelations for individuation. They may consistently hold, for example,\nthat the unique hues are qualities that simply differ and have no\nmetaphysical need for a principle of individuation. An epistemological\nproblem, however, may appear to remain: How can epiphenomenalists know\nthat they experience different phenomenal qualities? This, however, is\nthe self-stultification problem in a different guise, and\nepiphenomenalists can refer to the responses already considered.\n",
