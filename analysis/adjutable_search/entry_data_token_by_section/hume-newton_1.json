    "main_text": "Hume\u2019s Scientific Education\n2. Hume\u2019s Scientific Education\n\nThere is surprisingly little direct evidence of Hume\u2019s knowledge\nof Newton\u2019s texts. Most of it is circumstantial. Recent archival\nand careful hermeneutic research by Michael Barfoot (1990) has\nincreased our knowledge of the kind of education in different elements\nof natural philosophy Hume would have received as a student at\nEdinburgh (see also Emerson 2009; Stewart 2005; Wright 1990). This\nusefully supplements what can be gleaned from Hume\u2019s writings\nand letters. While new material may show up one day, four important\nconclusions follow from his study.\n\nFirst, it is very likely that Hume was exposed to many works in the\nnew natural philosophy, medicine, and mathematics in Europe and\nBritain. Second, while Hume was a student, Boyle\u2019s writings and\nmethodology were emphasized at The University of Edinburgh. It appears\nthat Boyle was favored as the pre-eminent exemplar of modern natural\nphilosophy because of the theological uses of this form of knowledge\nin eighteenth century natural religion. Given the tenor of the\neducation at Edinburgh and evidence derived from Hume\u2019s oeuvre,\nit is very likely that Hume had a working knowledge of Boyle\u2019s\nhydrostatics. Besides, if Hume\u2019s project aims at an account of\nhidden processes underlying observed regularities (as Landy 2017\nsuggests), as opposed to inductively establishing those regularities,\nthen Hume\u2019s project is consonant with much of Boyle\u2019s (see\nSargent 1995).\n\nSecond, while at the Jesuit College at La Fl\u00e8che\n(1735\u201337) Hume was certainly exposed to Cartesian and\nMalebranchian ideas (Perinetti 2018), and some of his most influential\narguments, concerning, e.g., causation and natural theology had their\norigins in this intellectual environment. Some commentators (e.g.,\nWright 2009: 51ff) have argued that the proper interpretation of\nHume\u2019s methodological aspirations and his account of the mind\nshould spring primarily from this Cartesian and Malebranchian\ncontext.\n\nThird, Hume would have been reasonably familiar with Newton\u2019s\nOpticks, especially his writings on colors. It is less clear\nhow thorough his working knowledge of it was (see Schliesser 2004 for\nsome concerns). However, it is less likely that he was exposed to most\nof the technically challenging parts of Principia. As the\ncatalogue at La Fl\u00e8che testifies, there was four entries\ndirectly related to Newton, of which only one, a 1720 French edition\nof Newton\u2019s Opticks (but no edition of\nPrincipia), refers to an edition that could have been there\nduring Hume\u2019s stay (Perinetti 2018: 51). Moreover, if Hume never\nread the third edition of the Principia, then this could help\nexplain his lack of interest in Newton\u2019s fourth rule of\nreasoning which was added to the third edition (see\n section 4.5,\n Rules of Reasoning).\n\nFourth, it remains unclear how proficient Hume became in mathematics.\nThere is manuscript evidence that he attended George Campbell\u2019s\nextramural lectures on\n fluxions.[2]\n These notes require careful study, but Barfoot reports that these\nmanuscripts show \u201clittle evidence of the application of fluxions\nto natural philosophy as such\u201d (1990: 190 fn76). Barfoot is\ncorrect to suggest that Hume\u2019s treatment of mathematics shows\ndebts to Berkeley\u2019s criticism of Newton. There is less evidence\nfor Barfoot\u2019s claim that Hume would have had working knowledge\nof the most technical parts of the Principia.\n\nIt is likely that Hume did get to know the relevant editions of\nOpticks already during his years spent at the University of\nEdinburgh, and may well have been exposed to lectures on it as well,\nbut it is uncertain how reliable his working knowledge of it was\n(Barfoot 1990, esp. 158 and 152). Although in general he was\ndissatisfied with university education, at least he found some\nsatisfaction in his natural philosophy class taught by Robert Steuart\n(Stewart 2005: 21\u201325). A probably more important introduction to\nthe outlook that has spread due to the influence of the\nOpticks came from Hume\u2019s medical readings in relation\nto his mental breakdown at the age of 18. The most important document\nof this struggle is his 1734 \u201cLetter to a Physician\u201d\n(Letters 1:14\u201318.), in which the medical description of\nhis condition, as M.A. Stewart (2005: 24n48) puts it, \u201cseems to\nbe consciously modelled on George Cheyne\u2019s The English\nMalady\u201d, published in 1733. A similarly likely source is\nMandeville\u2019s Treatise of the Hypochondriack and Hysterick\nDiseases (1st ed. 1711, 2nd ed. 1730, see\nWright 2009: 8\u20139). In his latter life he probably benefitted\nfrom discussions with philosophical friends and colleagues, most\nnotably with William Cullen and Joseph Black, these discussions,\nhowever, came only after the publication of Hume\u2019s chief\nphilosophical works. These friendships were indeed philosophical in\nthe sense that they were founded, at least partly, on sympathies for\nHume\u2019s philosophical project (see, e.g., Hume\u2019s letter to\nCullen in Letters 1:163)\n\nIt should be emphasized, however, that archival evidence may radically\nchange our picture of Hume\u2019s formal education and continuing\ninterest in Newton\u2019s natural philosophy. In addition to the\nmanuscript mentioned above, known marginal notes in Hume\u2019s hand\nin a copy of the Edinburgh Review, where works in Newtonian\nnatural philosophy were reviewed, may reveal further evidence about\nthe nature and quality of his response to issues in Newtonian natural\n philosophy.[3]\n",
