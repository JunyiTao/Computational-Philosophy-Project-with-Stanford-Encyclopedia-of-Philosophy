    "main_text": "\n\nKarl Leonhard Reinhold (1757\u20131823), Austrian philosopher and\nfirst occupant of the chair on Critical Philosophy established at the\nUniversity of Jena in 1787, first achieved fame as a proponent of\npopular Enlightenment and as an early and effective popularizer of the\nKantian philosophy. During his period at the University of Jena\n(1787\u201394), Reinhold proclaimed the need for a more\n\u201cscientific\u201d and systematic presentation of the Critical\nphilosophy, one based upon a single, self-evident first principle. In\nan effort to satisfy this need, he expounded his own \u201cElementary\nPhilosophy\u201d in a series of influential works between 1789 and\n1791. Though Reinhold\u2019s Elementary Philosophy was much\ncriticized, his call for a more coherent and systematic exposition of\ntranscendental idealism exercised a profound influence upon the\nsubsequent development of post-Kantian idealism and spurred others\n(such as J. G. Fichte) to seek a philosophical first principle even\nmore \u201cfundamental\u201d than Reinhold\u2019s own\n\u201cPrinciple of Consciousness.\u201d After moving to the\nUniversity of Kiel, Reinhold became an adherent, first of\nFichte\u2019s Wissenschaftslehre and then of C. G.\nBardili\u2019s \u201crational realism,\u201d before finally\nproposing a novel \u201clinguistic\u201d approach to philosophical\nproblems.\n",
