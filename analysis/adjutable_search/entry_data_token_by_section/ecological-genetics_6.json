    "main_text": "Allozyme Variation and the Drift vs Selection Controversy\n7. Sequence Variation and the Drift vs Selection Controversy\n\nThe neutral theory of evolution is the antithesis of ecological\ngenetics. It states that random genetic drift, independent of the\nenvironment, rather than natural selection, governs most evolutionary\nchange at the level of the DNA and proteins. At the same time, it\nadmits that natural selection predominates in shaping the\nmorphological and physiological traits that manifest an adaptive fit\nwith the environment. This is a paradox because most of the DNA\nappears to be non-functional while most of the externally observable\nphenotype appears to have adaptive function.\n\nTests of the theory using DNA sequence data consist of comparisons of\nthe relative evolutionary rates of different kinds of sites (base\npairs) within codons and take advantage of the redundancy in the\ngenetic code. The rate of neutral evolution is estimated from levels\nof polymorphism or numbers of segregating sites within species or the\ndivergence between species in silent or redundant site substitutions\n(e.g., Dapper & Wade 2020). Silent sites are those that do not\nresult in an amino acid change in the protein and, hence, are\nnon-functional in the usual sense. In contrast, the rate of selective\nchange or selective constraint is evaluated relative to the neutral\nrate using replacement sites, those base pair changes that result in\namino acid changes. If the rate of substitution or polymorphism is\nlower than neutral, it is evidence of selective constraint or\npurifying natural selection acting to prevent change and preserve\nfunction in the face of mutational damage. If the rate of substitution\nis higher than neutral, then it is evidence of adaptive substitution.\n\n\nMolecular evolutionary studies also revealed the existence of\npseudogenes, non-coding stretches of DNA derived by the\ntandem duplication and subsequent inactivation by mutation of single\ncopy genes. The lack of function of the pseudogene makes all of its\ncodons effectively neutral and provides another estimate of the rate\nof neutral evolution. Importantly, \u201creplacement\u201d sites\nthat evolve slowly in the functional gene have been shown to evolve\nmore rapidly in the nonfunctional tandem duplicate pseudogene.\n\nChanges in the pattern of neutral variation in the vicinity of a\nselected site(s) are also informative because, during an adaptive\nsubstitution, neutral variants linked to the piece of selected DNA are\ncarried or \u201cswept\u201d to fixation along with it. This\n\u201cselective sweep\u201d temporarily reduces the level of neutral\nvariation in the vicinity of selected sites until it can be replaced\nby mutation. The degree of reduction in neutral variation or the\n\u201cfootprint of selection\u201d depends upon the strength of\nselection, the frequency of recombination during selection, and the\ntime since the initiation of selection. The footprint is most\nconspicuous when a selective sweep is initiated by the advent of a\nsingle, novel favorable mutation. To the extent that novel selection\nresults from a change of environment and begins to act on existing or\nstanding variation already in the population, the impact on neutral\npolymorphisms may be quite minimal.\n\nBalancing selection of the sort observed by Ford leaves its own unique\n\u201creverse\u201d footprint on neutral diversity (Kreitman &\nDi Rienzo 2004) . Because the segments of DNA constituting the\nbalanced polymorphism are held in the population by selection much\nlonger than expected based on random drift, these segments have a\nhigher effective population size (owing to lower variation in\noffspring numbers than random). As a result, they have a longer time\nto accumulate mutational variation at nearby neutral sites. In some\ncases, the time is longer than that required to create new species,\nresulting in trans-specific polymorphisms (Cho et al. 2006).\nThus, levels of neutral diversity are expected to be enhanced in the\nvicinity of a molecular balanced polymorphism. When the mating system\nrestricts recombination (e.g., selfing or inbreeding species), the\nregion of elevated neutral diversity in the vicinity of a balanced\npolymorphism can be extensive (e.g., Arabiodopsis thaliana\n[Tian et al. 2002]).\n\nKimura predicted that silent substitutions would evolve more rapidly\nthan replacement substitutions before sequence data were\navailable to test his neutral theory of molecular evolution. Molecular\ngenetic studies have confirmed his prediction: silent sites evolve\nseveral times faster than replacement sites. These studies clearly\nshow that the primary mode of action of natural selection at the level\nof the DNA sequence is purifying selection. It is this highly\nconservative aspect of natural selection that permits comparative\nmolecular evolutionary studies of developmental processes across\nspecies as diverse as humans and flies. At the molecular level, most\ngenes, though polymorphic in sequence, do not display evidence of\nbalancing selection and instead manifest patterns of variation that\naccord well with neutral theory.\n\nThe interaction of selection and random drift across linked regions of\nDNA sequence is one of the most active current areas of theoretical\nand empirical research in molecular evolution. Theory shows that it\ncan be difficult to separate cleanly the action of the evolutionary\nforces of selection and drift except for certain regions of parameter\nspace, whose generality remains unknown and subject to much debate.\nLike the study by Fisher and Ford (1947), most empirical studies\ninterpret all deviations away from strictly the neutral\nexpectation as evidence of natural selection without addressing the\nissue of agency. For example, codon bias is evidence that natural\nselection affects even the apparently non-functional components of\ngenes. Thus, the original ecological genetic view that natural\nselection is the only significant evolutionary force characterizes\nmuch of modern molecular evolution, despite progress in theory and the\navailability of much more reductionistic genetic methods. The\nparallels between the summary statement of Ford\n (1975: 389; see above)\n and that of the molecular evolutionary geneticist, E. Nevo,\ntwenty-five years later are remarkable: \n\n\nBiodiversity evolution, even in small isolated populations, is\nprimarily driven by natural selection, including diversifying,\nbalancing, cyclical, and purifying selective regimes, interacting\nwith, but ultimately overriding, the effects of mutation, migration,\nand stochasticity [random genetic drift].
