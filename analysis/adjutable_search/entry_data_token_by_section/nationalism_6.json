    "main_text": "The Moral Debate || Arguments in favor of nationalism: issues of justice\n3.3 Arguments in favor of nationalism: issues of justice\n\nThe arguments in the second set concern political justice and do not\nrely on metaphysical claims about identity, flourishing, and cultural\nvalues. They appeal to (actual or alleged) circumstances that would\nmake nationalist policies reasonable (or permissible or even\nmandatory), such as (a) the fact that a large part of the world is\norganized into nation-states (so that each new group aspiring to\ncreate a nation-state just follows an established pattern), or (b) the\ncircumstances of group self-defense or of redressing past injustice\nthat might justify nationalist policies (to take a special case). Some\nof the arguments also present nationhood as conducive to important\npolitical goods, such as equality.\n\n The Argument from the Right to Collective\nSelf-determination. A group of people of a sufficient size has a\nprima facie right to govern itself and decide its future\nmembership, if the members of the group so wish. It is fundamentally\nthe democratic will of the members themselves that grounds the right\nto an ethno-national state and to ethno-centric cultural institutions\nand practices. This argument presents the justification of\n(ethno-)national claims as deriving from the will of the members of\nthe nation. It is therefore highly suitable for liberal nationalism\nbut not appealing to a deep communitarian who sees the demands of the\nnation as independent from, and prior to, the choices of particular\n individuals.[22]\nThe Argument from the Right to Self-defense and to Redress\nPast Injustices. Oppression and injustice give the victimized\ngroup a just cause and the right to secede. If a minority group is\noppressed by the majority to the extent that almost every minority\nmember is worse off than most members of the majority simply in virtue\nof belonging to the minority, then nationalist claims on behalf of the\nminority are morally plausible and potentially compelling. The\nargument establishes a typical remedial right, acceptable from a\nliberal standpoint (see the discussion in Kukathas and Poole 2000,\nalso Buchanan 1991; for past injustices see Waldron 1992).\nThe Argument from Equality. Members of a minority group\nare often disadvantaged in relation to the dominant culture because\nthey have to rely on those with the same language and culture to\nconduct the affairs of daily life. Therefore, liberal neutrality\nitself requires that the majority provide certain basic cultural\ngoods, i.e., granting differential rights (see Kymlicka 1995b, 2001,\nand 2003b). Institutional protections and the right to the minority\ngroup\u2019s own institutional structure are remedies that restore\nequality and turn the resulting nation-state into a more moderate\nmulticultural one.\n The Argument from Success. The nationstate has in the\npast succeeded in promoting equality and democracy. Ethno-national\nsolidarity is a powerful motive for a more egalitarian distribution of\ngoods (Miller 1995; Canovan 1996, 2000). The nation-state also seems\nto be essential to safeguard the moral life of communities in the\nfuture, since it is the only form of political institution capable of\nprotecting communities from the threats of globalization and\nassimilationism (for a detailed critical discussion of this argument\nsee Mason 1999).\n\n\nAndreas Wimmer (2018) presents an interesting discussion of the\nhistorical success of nation-state (discussed in Knott, Tolz, Green,\n& Wimmer 2019).\n\nThese political arguments can be combined with deep communitarian\nones. However, taken in isolation, their perspectives offer a\n\u201cliberal culturalism\u201d that is more suitable for\nethno-culturally plural societies. More remote from classical\nnationalism than the liberal one of Tamir and Nielsen, it eschews any\ncommunitarian philosophical\n underpinning.[23]\n The idea of moderate nation-building points to an open\nmulti-culturalism in which every group receives its share of remedial\nrights but, instead of walling itself off from others, participates in\na common, overlapping civic culture in open communication with other\nsub-communities. Given the variety of pluralistic societies and\nintensity of trans-national interactions, such openness seems to many\nto be the only guarantee of stable social and political life (see the\ndebate in Shapiro and Kymlicka 1997).\n\nIn general, the liberal nationalist stance is mild and civil, and\nthere is much to be said in favor of it. It tries to reconcile our\nintuitions in favor of some sort of political protection of cultural\ncommunities with a liberal political morality. Of course, this raises\nissues of compatibility between liberal universal principles and the\nparticular attachments to one\u2019s ethno-cultural nation. Very\nliberal nationalists such as Tamir divorce ethno-cultural nationhood\nfrom statehood. Also, the kind of love for country they suggest is\ntempered by all kinds of universalist considerations, which in the\nlast instance trump national interest (Tamir 1993: 115; 2019: passim,\nsee also Moore 2001 and Gans 2003). There is an ongoing debate among\nphilosophical nationalists about how much weakening and compromising\nis still compatible with a stance\u2019s being nationalist at\n all.[24]\n There is also a streak of cosmopolitan interest present in the work\nof some liberal nationalists (Nielsen\n 1998\u201399).[25]\n\nIn the last two decades, the issues of nationalism have been\nincreasingly integrated into the debate about the international order\n(see the entries on\n globalization\n and\n cosmopolitanism).\n The main conceptual link is the claim that nation-states are natural,\nstable, and suitable units of the international order. A related\ndebate concerns the role of minorities in the processes of\nglobalization (see Kaldor 2004). Moreover, the two approaches might\nultimately converge: a multiculturalist liberal nationalism and a\nmoderate, difference-respecting cosmopolitanism have a lot in\n common.[26]\n",
