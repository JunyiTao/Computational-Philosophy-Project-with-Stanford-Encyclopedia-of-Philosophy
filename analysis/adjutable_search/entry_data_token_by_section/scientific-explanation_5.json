    "main_text": "The DN Model || Explanatory Understanding and Nomic Expectability: Counterexamples to Sufficiency\n2.5 Explanatory Understanding and Nomic Expectability: Counterexamples to Sufficiency\n\nAs explained above, examples like\n (3)\n are potential counterexamples to the claim that the DN model\nprovides necessary conditions for explanation. There are also\na number of well-known counterexamples to the claim that the\nDN model provides sufficient conditions for\nsuccessful scientific explanation. Here are two illustrations.\n\nExplanatory Asymmetries. There are many cases in\nwhich a derivation of an explanandum E from a law L and\ninitial conditions I seems explanatory but a\n\u201cbackward\u201d derivation of I from E and the\nsame law L does not seem explanatory, even though the latter,\nlike the former, appears to meet the criteria for successful\nDN explanation. For example, one can derive the length\ns of the shadow cast by a flagpole from the height h of\nthe pole and the angle \u03b8 of the sun above the horizon and laws\nabout the rectilinear propagation of light. This derivation meets the\nDN criteria and seems explanatory. On the other hand, the\nfollowing derivation from the same laws also meets the DN\ncriteria but does not seem explanatory:\n\n(4)\nOne can derive the height h of a flagpole from the length\ns of its shadow and the angle \u03b8 of the sun above the\nhorizon.\n\n\nExamples like this suggest that at least some explanations possess\ndirectional or asymmetric features to which the DN model is\ninsensitive.\n\nExplanatory Irrelevancies. A derivation can satisfy\nthe DN criteria and yet be a defective explanation because it\ncontains irrelevancies besides those associated with the directional\nfeatures of explanation. Consider an example due to Wesley Salmon\n(1971a: 34):\n\n(5)\n\n\n(L)\nAll males who take birth control pills regularly fail to get\npregnant\n(K)\nJohn Jones is a male who has been taking birth control pills\nregularly\n(E)\n John Jones fails to get pregnant\n\n\n\nIt is arguable that (L) meets the criteria for lawfulness\nimposed by Hempel and many other writers. (If one wants to deny that\n(L) is a law one needs some principled, generally accepted\nbasis for this judgment and, as explained above, it is unclear what\nthis basis is.) Moreover,\n (5)\n is certainly a sound deductive argument in which (L) occurs as\nan essential premise. Nonetheless, most people judge that (L)\nand (K) are no explanation of (E). There are many other\nsimilar illustrations. For example (Kyburg 1965), it is presumably a\nlaw (or at least an exceptionless, counterfactual supporting\ngeneralization) that all samples of table salt that have been hexed by\nbeing touched with the wand of a witch dissolve when placed in water.\nOne may use this generalization as a premise in a DN\nderivation which has as its conclusion that some particular hexed\nsample of salt has dissolved in water. But again the hexing is\nirrelevant to the dissolving and such a derivation is no\nexplanation.\n\nOne obvious diagnosis of the difficulties posed by examples like\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n focuses on the role of causation in explanation. According to this\nanalysis, to explain an outcome we must cite its causes and\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n fail to do this. As Salmon (1989a: 47) puts it, \n\n\na flagpole of a certain height causes a shadow of a given length and\nthereby explains the length of the shadow. \n\n\nBy contrast, \n\n\nthe shadow does not cause the flagpole and consequently cannot explain\nits height. \n\n\nSimilarly, taking birth control pills does not cause Jones\u2019\nfailure to get pregnant and this is why\n (5)\n fails to be an acceptable explanation. On this analysis, what\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n show is that a derivation can satisfy the DN criteria and\nyet fail to identify the causes of an explanandum\u2014when this\nhappens the derivation will fail to be explanatory.\n\nAs explained above, advocates of the DN model would not\nregard this diagnosis as very illuminating, unless accompanied by some\naccount of causation that does not simply take this notion as\nprimitive. (Salmon in fact provides such an account, which we will\nconsider in\n Section 4.)\n We should note, however, that an apparent lesson of\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n is that the regularity account of causation favored by DN\ntheorists is at best incomplete: the occurrence of c, e,\nand the existence of some regularity or law linking them (or\nx\u2019s having property P and x\u2019s having\nproperty Q and some law linking these) is not a\nsufficient condition for the truth of the claim that c caused\n or x\u2019s having P is causally or\nexplanatorily relevant to x\u2019s having Q. More\ngenerally, if the counterexamples\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n are accepted, it follows that the DN model fails to state\nsufficient conditions for explanation. Explaining an outcome\nisn\u2019t just a matter of showing that it is nomically\nexpectable.\n\nThere are two possible reactions one might have to this observation.\nOne is that the idea that explanation is a matter of nomic\nexpectability is correct as far as it goes, but that something more is\nrequired as well. According to this assessment, the DN/IS\nmodel does state a necessary condition for successful\nexplanation and, moreover, a condition that is a non-redundant part of\na set of conditions that are jointly sufficient for explanation.\nHowever, some other, independent feature, X (which will account\nfor the directional features of explanation and insure the kind of\nexplanatory relevance that is apparently missing in the birth control\nexample) must be added to the DN model to achieve a\nsuccessful account of explanation. The idea is thus that Nomic\nExpectability + X = Explanation. Something like this idea is endorsed, by\nthe unificationist models of explanation developed by Friedman (1974)\nand Kitcher (1989), which are discussed in\n Section 5\n below.\n\nA second, more radical possible conclusion is that the DN\naccount of the goal or rationale of explanation is mistaken in some\nmuch more fundamental way and that the DN model does not even\nstate necessary conditions for successful explanation. As noted above,\nunless the hidden structure argument is accepted, this conclusion is\nstrongly suggested by examples like\n (3)\n (\u201cThe impact of my knee caused the tipping over of the\ninkwell\u201d) which appear to involve explanation without the\nexplicit citing of a law or a deductive structure.\n\nSuggested Readings. The most authoritative and\ncomprehensive statement of the DN and IS models is\nprobably Hempel (1965b). This is reprinted in Hempel 1965a, along with\na number of other papers that touch on various aspects of the problem\nof scientific explanation. In addition to the references cited in this\nsection, Salmon (1989: 46ff.) describes a number of well-known\ncounterexamples to the DN/IS models and discusses their\nsignificance.\n",
