    "main_text": "Semantic Restrictions || Situations and Rigid Operations\n4.1 Situations and Rigid Operations\n\nEdgington (1985) offers a situation-theoretic diagnosis of Fitch\u2019s\nparadox. She claims that the problem lies with the failure to\ndistinguish between \u2018knowing in a situation that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 and \u2018knowing that \\(p\\) is the case in a\nsituation\u2019. In the latter case, the situation is (at least in\npart) that which the knowledge is about. In the former case, the\nsituation is that in which the knowledge is had. For instance, I may\nknow in my actual situation that I would be in pain in a\ncounterfactual situation where my tooth is pulled. Importantly, the\nsituation in which the knowledge takes place may be different from the\nsituation that my knowledge is about. In a situation in which my tooth\nis not pulled, I may know things that are about a situation\nin which my tooth is pulled. \n\nWhat are situations? The above example seems to suggest that\nsituations are worlds. But situations may be less complete than\nworlds. That is, they need not have truth-values fixed for statements\nthat are irrelevant to the context. Consider an example by\nLinst\u00f6m: I may know in a given perceptual situation \\(s\\)\nthat John (one of the participants of a card game) has the best hand\nand that none of the participants knows this. In this case my\nknowledge is of one situation \\(s^*\\), the card game, but my\nknowledge is acquired in a different situation \\(s\\), my\nperceptual situation. Situation \\(s^*\\) is not only determined,\nbut its relevant information is limited, by the context of the card\ngame. And \\(s\\) is fixed and limited by the context of the\nperceptual situation. Edgington prefers talk of situations rather than\nworlds, because knowledge of non-actual situations, unlike knowledge\nof non-actual worlds, does not require knowledge of an infinite amount\nof detail.\n\nMaking explicit the situation-theoretic distinction between\n\u2018knowing in\u2019 and \u2018knowing about\u2019, we may\nreinterpret the knowability principle: for each statement \\(p\\)\nand situation \\(s\\), if \\(p\\) is true in \\(s\\) then\nthere is a situation \\(s^*\\) in which it is known that \\(p\\)\nis true in \\(s\\). Edgington requires of knowability the less\ngeneral thesis: if \\(p\\) is true in an actual situation\n\\(s\\) then there is a possible situation \\(s^*\\) in which it\nis known that \\(p\\) is true in \\(s\\). Call this\nE-knowability or EKP:\n\n\\[\\tag{EKP}\n\\A p \\rightarrow \\Diamond K\\A p,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere A is the actuality operator which may be read \u2018In some\nactual situation\u2019, and \\(\\Diamond\\) is the possibility operator to be\nread \u2018In some possible situation\u2019.\n\nAs we see, EKP restricts the knowability principle to actual truths,\nby saying \\(p\\) is actually true only if there is a possible\nsituation in which it is known that \\(p\\) is actually true. \n\nThe important suggestion is this. Just as there may be actual\nknowledge of what is counterfactually the case, there may be\ncounterfactual knowledge of what is actually the case. In fact, in\nlight of Fitch\u2019s proof, E-knowability requires the existence of such\nnon-actual knowledge. Let us see why.\n\nActual truths of the form \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) will have\nto be E-knowable. But \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) cannot be\nactually known to be actually the case. The reasoning here is exactly\nanalogous to Fitch\u2019s reasoning. \n\nThe lesson is this. Since, for some \\(p, p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is actually the case, E-knowability commits us to\npossible knowledge that \\(p \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is actually\nthe case. Since this knowledge cannot be actual, E-knowability\nrequires non-actual knowledge of what is actually the case.\nE-knowability then denies the following assumption: given a statement\n\\(p\\), if it is known that \\(p\\) in \\(s\\), then in\n\\(s\\) it is known that \\(p\\). By Edgington\u2019s analysis it is\nexactly this implicit assumption that leads Fitch\u2019s reasoning astray.\nThe paradox is blocked without it.\n",
