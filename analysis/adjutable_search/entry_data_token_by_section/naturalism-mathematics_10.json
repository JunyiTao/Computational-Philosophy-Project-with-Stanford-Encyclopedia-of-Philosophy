    "main_text": "Elucidating Methodological Naturalism || Broader naturalisms\n3.6 Broader naturalisms\n\n\nScientific naturalism as here defined encompasses only\nnatural science (and likewise for scientific-cum-mathematical\nnaturalism). Broader naturalisms take in not just traditional natural\nscience but also some of the other sciences: perhaps all of social\nscience, perhaps only some of it, perhaps linguistics, perhaps\ncognitive science. Note that in later writings Quine himself adopts a\nbroad version of naturalism (1995, 49). Penelope Maddy has more\nrecently made it clear that the form of scientific naturalism she\nespouses\u2014\u2018Second Philosophy\u2019 as she now prefers to\ncall it\u2014is very broad indeed, taking in not only the natural\nsciences but also psychology, linguistics, sociology, etc. (2007,\n2).\n\n\nBroadening scientific or scientific-cum-mathematical naturalism to\ninclude these disciplines has potentially significant consequences for\nthe philosophy of mathematics. For instance, if semantics falls under\nthe naturalist umbrella it may provide a naturalistic sanction for\nmathematical realism or platonism, as the face value semantics for\nmathematics seems to assimilate it to the uncontroversially literal\nparts of language\u2014a point famously made in Benacerraf (1973).\n\n\nWhether to construe naturalism broadly or narrowly depends on its\nmotivation. The attractions of scientific or mathematical or\nscientific-cum-mathematical naturalism lie in the disciplines'\nincomparable success (on some understanding of what this success comes\nto\u2014see section 4). At this point in time, however, the\nnon-natural sciences are less successful than the natural\nsciences. The less successful one deems the non-natural sciences\ncompared to the natural ones, the less attractive a broader scientific\nor scientific-cum-mathematical naturalism becomes in comparison with a\nstrictly natural-scientific one.\n\n\nAll naturalists, especially those of the broader variety, have to\nbalance potentially competing standards. A broad naturalist might\ndecide, say, to give the natural sciences 2/3-weighting and semantics\n1/3-weighting. Or she might hold that a proposition in the philosophy\nof mathematics is acceptable if (or even: if and only if) all the\nsciences, natural or non-natural, sanction it\u2014that is to say,\nwhen all the sciences speak with one voice.  These balancing questions\nhave unfortunately not been much addressed by naturalists. Perhaps\nthat is because questions of this kind arise for everyone: whichever\njustificatory standards one accepts, the problem of how to adjudicate\nbetween them arises. But to the extent that naturalism is prescriptive\nand cannot rely on an implicit procedure that is already in place, it\nowes us an articulation of how to balance different sets of\nstandards.\n\n\nThe balancing issue is particularly pressing for\nmathematical-cum-scientific naturalists. A scientific naturalist is in\nprinciple happy to say that if a mathematical theory M is\nscientifically superior but mathematically inferior to another\nmathematical theory M* then M should be\npreferred to M* (the next paragraph contains an\nexample). Mathematical-cum-scientific naturalists, however, may come\ndown on either side, depending on the details of the particular\ntheories: it all depends on whether M's scientific advantages\ncompared to M* are outweighed by its mathematical\ndisadvantages. Now the philosophy of mathematics does not have an\nestablished tradition of weighing mathematical theories' scientific\nand mathematical pros and cons against one another; nor does any other\ndiscipline. So the problem of how to balance mathematical and\nscientific standards is particularly pressing for the\nmathematical-cum-scientific naturalist.\n\n\nTo illustrate this problem, suppose, as many philosophers maintain,\nthat the general principle of ontological economy\u2014posit as few\nentities as possible\u2014is a scientific standard. Suppose also, as\nPenelope Maddy maintains, that a set-theoretic version of ontological\nprofligacy\u2014posit as many sets as possible\u2014is a\nmathematical standard (this is one way of cashing out the\nset-theoretic maxim Maddy calls MAXIMIZE). These two\nstandards clash, as Maddy recognises (1997, 131). Thus given these\nassumptions a predicativist set theory which posits a relatively small\nnumber of sets, say of the kind developed in Hermann Weyl's Das\nKontinuum, might be scientifically superior to ZFC, which posits\nmore sets. Yet ZFC is generally thought to be mathematically superior\nto a predicativist set theory. Perhaps the right diagnosis is\nthat the clash is only superficial, since the correct scientific\nversion of ontological economy is \u2018posit as\nfew concrete entities as possible\u2019 and the correct\nmathematical version of ontological profligacy is \u2018posit as\nmany abstract entities as possible\u2019. However that may\nbe in this instance, the mathematical-cum-scientific naturalist has to come up with a\ngeneral policy for dealing with potential clashes, or argue that no\nsuch clashes are possible.\n",
