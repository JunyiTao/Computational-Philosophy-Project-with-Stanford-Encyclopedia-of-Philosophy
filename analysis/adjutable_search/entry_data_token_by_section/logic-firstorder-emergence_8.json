    "main_text": "Thoralf Skolem\n9. Thoralf Skolem\n\nSkolem in the winter of 1915\u201316 visited G\u00f6ttingen, where he\ndiscussed set theory with Felix Bernstein; there is no sign that he\nmet Hilbert. He was already at this time familiar with\nL\u00f6wenheim\u2019s theorem, and knew of its paradoxical\nimplications for Zermelo\u2019s axiomatization of set theory:\nspecifically, that a first-order axiomatization of the theory of\nnon-denumerable sets would have a denumerable model. He did not at the\ntime publish on these topics because, as he later said:\n\n\nI believed that it was so clear that the axiomatization of set theory\nwould not be satisfactory as an ultimate foundation for mathematics\nthat, by and large, mathematicians would not bother themselves with it\nvery much. To my astonishment I have seen recently that many\nmathematicians regard these axioms for set theory as the ideal\nfoundation for mathematics. For this reason it seemed to me that the\ntime had come to publish a critique. (Skolem 1922: appendix.)\n\n\nSkolem\u2019s first major papers were his 1920 and especially his\n1922. In the first he proved (or re-proved) in a more perspicuous form\nthe downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem. In the second he provided\na new proof of that result. He also criticized Zermelo\u2019s axiom\nof separation, which had taken the form: Given a set S and a\ndefinite proposition \\(\\phi(x)\\), there exists a set\nS\u2019 of all elements s of S such\nthat \\(\\phi(s)\\). Here the concept of \u201cdefinite\nproposition\u201d was left somewhat imprecise. Skolem\u2019s\nproposal was to identify \u201cdefinite propositions\u201d with the\nformulas of first-order logic (with identity). Although Skolem\ndeclared this identification to be \u201cnatural\u201d and\n\u201ccompletely clear\u201d, he did not explicitly argue for the\nrestriction of quantifiers to the first level. He then gave the\nearliest satisfactory first-order formulation of Zermelo\u2019s set\ntheory, and then applied the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem result to obtain\nthe Skolem paradox. \n\nThese technical results were of great importance for the subsequent\ndebate over first-order logic. But it is important not to read into\nSkolem 1922 a later understanding of the issues. Skolem at this point\ndid not possess a distinction between the object language and the\nmetalanguage. And although in retrospect his axiomatization of set\ntheory can be interpreted to be first-order, he nowhere emphasizes\nthat fact. (Indeed, Eklund (1996) presents a compelling argument that\nSkolem did not yet clearly appreciate the significance of the\ndistinction between first-order and second-order logic, and that the\nreformulation of the axiom of separation is not in fact as\nunambiguously first-order as it is often taken to be.) \n\nSkolem\u2019s remarks about first-order logic require careful\ninterpretation (see, e.g., Ferreir\u00f3s 2001: 470\u201374), but\nclearly must be viewed against the backdrop of the\nGrundlagenkrise of the 1920s, and of the debates between\nHilbert, Brouwer, and Weyl. There are two broad tendencies within\nlogic during these years, and they pull in opposite directions. One\ntendency is towards pruning down logical and mathematical\nsystems so as to accommodate the criticisms of Brouwer and his\nfollowers. The aim was to avoid the paradoxes, to delimit the\nterritory of \u201clegitimate\u201d mathematics, and to place it on\nsecure foundations. Set theory was in dispute, and Skolem explicitly\npresented his 1922 results as a critique of set theoretical\nfoundations. Weyl already in 1910 had been led by his examination of\nZermelo\u2019s system to formulate a set of logical principles that\nin retrospect (and despite the idiosyncratic notation) can be seen to\nbe a form of first-order logic. In general, both Weyl and Skolem\ninclined, on methodological grounds, towards some sort of\nconstructivism as a means of avoiding the paradoxes; and this meant\nthat they viewed quantification over, say, the totality of subsets of\nan infinite set as something to be avoided: whatever one\u2019s grasp\non the notion of \u201call integers\u201d, the notion of \u201call\nproperties of integers\u201d was far less firm. To put the matter\nslightly differently: the very point of axiomatizing set theory was to\nstate its philosophically problematic assumptions in such a way that\none could clearly see what they came to. But this aim would be\ncompromised if one already presupposed in the background logic the\nproblematical notion of \u201call subsets\u201d that one was\nattempting to elucidate. One possibility was to restrict oneself to\nfirst-order logic; another, to adopt some sort of predicative\nhigher-order system.\n\nSimilar broadly constructivist tendencies were also very much in\nevidence in the proof theoretical work of Hilbert and Bernays and\ntheir followers in the 1920s. Already by the time of Hilbert\u2019s\n1921/22 lectures Hilbert had identified the introduction of the\n(classical) quantifiers as the crucial step where the transfinite\nentered logic. Hilbert, like C. S. Peirce long before, thought of the\nquantifiers as infinite conjunctions and disjunctions, and from the\nearly 1920s onwards it was well understood in G\u00f6ttingen that, for\nthe programmatic goals of the Hilbert consistency program to be\ncarried out, a finitary analysis of the quantifiers was necessary. The\nepsilon-substitution method was the principal device Hilbert\nintroduced in order to attempt to attain this result. (A survey of\nthis research is provided by Sieg 2009 and in the introductory notes\nto Hilbert [LFL].)\n\nBut despite these constructive tendencies, many logicians of the 1920s\n(including Hilbert) continued to regard higher-order type theory, and\nnot its first-order fragment, as the appropriate logic for\ninvestigations in the foundations of mathematics. The ultimate hope\nwas to provide a consistency proof for the whole of classical\nmathematics (including set theory). But, in the meanwhile, researchers\nstill were somewhat unclear about certain basic distinctions. Hilbert\nat times fails to observe the distinction between a first-order\naxiom-schema and a second-order axiom; Brouwer\u2019s intuitionism is\nsometimes identified with \u201cfinitism\u201d; the relationships\nbetween completeness (in several senses), categoricity (also in\nseveral senses), and first-order and higher-order logic were not yet\nunderstood. Indeed, Gregory Moore points out that even G\u00f6del, in\nhis 1929 proof of the completeness of first-order logic, did not fully\nunderstand the notion of categoricity and its relationship to\nsecond-order logic (Moore 1988: 125).\n",
