    "main_text": "Who was condemned on March 7, 1277?\n4. Who was condemned on March 7, 1277?\n\nThe question of who the targets were of Tempier\u2019s condemnation\ncannot be entirely separated from the question of what views were\ncensured. As was mentioned above, Tempier did not identify the targets\nof his condemnation, but merely indicated that it was directed against\nunspecified members of the arts faculty in Paris. Even though their\nnames appear nowhere in the document itself (and in the rubrics of\nonly two of the many medieval manuscripts which have preserved\nTempier\u2019s condemnation), Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia\nhave been singled out as the most prominent targets of the 1277\ncensure.\n\nYet, their identification should be qualified, as becomes clear from\nthe results, or should one say lack of results, of the ground-breaking\nstudy by Roland Hissette. He tried to identify the proximate\nbackground of the 219 condemned theses. As his point of departure,\nHissette took known works by Siger and Boethius and three anonymous\nwritings from the arts faculty that were available in a modern edition\nat the time that he wrote his study. From Hissette\u2019s own summary\nof the results of his careful examination it appears that surprisingly\nfew of the censured propositions could be identified with any degree\nof certainty in the known works of thirteenth-century\nartistae. Of the 219 propositions, only 79 can be identified,\nwith various degrees of probability, in the works of Siger of Brabant,\nBoethius of Dacia, or the three anonymous writings. Of 72 propositions\nthe attribution is uncertain, whereas 68 propositions could not be\nidentified at all. Moreover, many censured propositions that seem to\nhave been derived from the examined works that originated at the arts\nfaculty in the thirteenth century do not really represent the\nauthor\u2019s own view, but rather appear to be quotations or\nparaphrases from Aristotle, from Arabic philosophers, or from\n\u201cthe philosophers\u201d as Hissette himself indicates.\n\nHissette\u2019s examination was based on the assumption that\nTempier\u2019s censure envisioned only teachings from the faculty of\narts. The introductory letter, however, seems to contradict this\nassumption. There, Tempier draws an important distinction, which has\nnot been duly recognized in the scholarly literature, between\npropagators and views. He accuses the members of the arts faculty of\ndisseminating (tractare et disputare) manifest and damned\nerrors (manifesti et exsecrabiles errores). The errors are\nspecified in the roll or leaves connected to the introductory letter\n(in rotulo seu cedulis, praesentibus hiis annexo seu\nannexis). They are the 219 censured propositions. Tempier does\nnot state, however, that the members of the arts faculty are the\nauthors of these errors. In his introductory letter Tempier\nseparates the 219 censured errors from their propagators. Only the\npropagators have to be sought in the arts faculty in Paris: on pain of\nexcommunication, they are prohibited to dogmatize, disseminate, or\nsustain in any way (dogmatizare, aut defendere seu sustinere\nquoquo modo) the propositions collected by Tempier. The origin of\nthese propositions, however, is not stated in the introductory letter.\nIn other words, Tempier indicates that those artistae who\nwere castigated for disseminating false teachings were not necessarily\ndisseminating their own views. When drawing up the syllabus,\nTempier and his advisers relied on more sources, written or oral, than\nthose that were used by Hissette. Possibly, Tempier\u2019s list even\nincluded earlier lists of suspect views.\n\nThe inconclusiveness of Hissette\u2019s study strongly suggests that\nresearch into the proximate background of the censured propositions\nhas to be broadened. The directions that such research should take are\nindicated, either implicitly or explicitly, by Roland Hissette, and by\nother scholars such as John Wippel and Calvin Normore. Today it is\ngenerally agreed that a considerable number of the 219 censured\npropositions have a bearing on the reintroduction of pagan philosophy\ninto the arts faculty, and on the ensuing crisis over the relation of\nfaith and reason. Consequently, Greek or Arabic sources may prove to\nbe at the origin of a number of censured propositions, as is also\nsuggested in Tempier\u2019s preface, in which he indicated that the\nscholars whose errors he condemned took their inspiration from pagan\nwritings (cum errores praedictos gentilium scripturis\nmuniant), Other propositions may well have been derived from the\nteaching of theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas. In particular, John\nWippel has argued (against Roland Hissette) that Aquinas\u2019\nteaching was also implied in Tempier\u2019s condemnation and that\nsome of the positions were taken from his writings. In this respect,\nthe oft-quoted statement from Tempier\u2019s introductory letter that\nmembers of the arts faculty were transgressing the limits of their own\nfaculty (propriae facultatis limites excedentes) could\nacquire new meaning. Some members of the arts faculty were rebuked not\nonly for teaching suspect philosophical views but also for teaching\nsuspect theological views.\n\nAnother, complementary, line of inquiry has been suggested by Malcolm\nDe Mowbray. According to him, many of the theses may have originated\nfrom students during disputations in the schools. Given the oral\ncharacter of these exercises, it is only natural that they are\ndifficult to trace in extant works from masters of arts. Evidence for\nhis interpretation has De Mowbray found in Boethius of Dacia\u2019s\nDe aeternitate mundi, which, according to him, was meant to\nhelp students to hold a disputation. Much of De Mowbray\u2019s\ninterpretation hinges on our understanding of the Preface of\nTempier\u2019s condemnation, which mentions some people at the\narts-faculty (nonnulli Parisius studentes in artibus) who had\ndiscussed and disputed the condemned articles in the schools (in\nscolis tractare et disputare presumunt, ut eis nescient\nrespondere). His interpretation has been contested by Luca\nBianchi.\n\nRecently, Anthony Minnema has pointed out that article 112 (Mandonnet\n63), which mentions a camel, refers to a discussion of the\nsoul\u2019s power of impression in the Latin translation of\nal-Ghazali\u2019s Maq\u0101\u1e63idal-fal\u0101sifa.\n\nOn the basis of textual evidence provided by John of Naples, Maria\nEvelina Malgieri has suggested an improved text of article 156\n(Mandonnet 79): \u201cQuod si caelum staret ignis non ageret in\nstupam, quia nec Deus esset,\u201d rather than \u201cquia natura\ndeest,\u201d which was the traditional reading. This amendation is\nalso supported by some manuscripts of Tempier\u2019s\ncondemnation.\n",
