    "main_text": "Philosophical Aspects || Syntactic Categories and Semantic Types\n3.3 Syntactic Categories and Semantic Types\n\nAccording to Montague, the purpose of syntax is to provide the input\nto semantics:\n\nI fail to see any interest in syntax except as a preliminary to\nsemantics. (Montague 1970c, 223)\n\n\nAlthough syntax was in his eyes subordinate, he was fully explicit in\nhis rules in which he used some ad hoc syntactic tools.\n\nIn Montague 1970a and 1970c, the relation between syntactic categories\nand semantic types is given only by a list. Montague (1973) defines a\nsystematic relation which amounts to the same relation as one would\nhave in categorial grammar. However, Montague\u2019s syntax is not a\ncategorial syntax because the rules are not always category driven and\nbecause some of the rules are not concatenation rules.\n\nFor each of these two aspects, proposals have been put forward to\nchange the situation. One direction was to stay closer to the ideals\nof categorial grammar, with only type-driven rules, sometimes allowing\nfor a restricted extension of the power of concatenation rules (see,\nfor example, Morrill 1994, Carpenter 1998). The other approach was to\nincorporate in Montague grammar as much as possible the insights from\nsyntactic theories, especially originating from the tradition of\nChomsky. A first step was made by Partee (1973), who let the grammar\nproduce structures (labelled bracketings); a syntactically\nsophisticated grammar (with Chomskyan movement rules) was used in the\nRosetta translation project (Rosetta 1994). The influential textbook\nby Heim and Kratzer (1998) combined the two approaches by applying\ntype-driven interpretation to the syntactic level of (Chomskyan)\nLogical Forms.\n\nIn his syntactic accounts, Montague tended to treat\n\u2018logical\u2018 words like determiners (the, a,\nevery) and conjunctions (and, or, not)\nsyncategorematically, i.e., not by means of lexical entries, but as\nthe effect of specific syntactic rules; the reason for this decision\nis unknown, but it may be speculated that it was part of a\ncharacterization of grammatical meaning in terms of logicality,\npresumably along the lines of Tarski\u2019s 1986 invariance\ncriterion. As a consequence, a different rule is needed for John\nwalks and sings than for John walks and Mary sings:\nsyntactically the first one is a conjunction of verb phrases and the\nsecond one of sentences. However, the two meanings of and are\nclosely related and a generalization is missed. As a general solution\nit was proposed to use rules (or alternatively general principles)\nthat change the category of an expression \u2013 a change that\ncorresponds with a semantic rule that \u2018lifts\u2019 the meaning.\nFor instance, the meaning of and as a connective between verb\nphrases is obtained by lifting the meaning of the sentence connective\n\\(\\wedge\\) to \\(\\lambda P\\lambda Q\\lambda x[P(x) \\wedge Q(x)].\\) The\nline of analysis has been extensively studied in Partee and Rooth\n1983, Partee 1987, Hendriks 2001, and Winter 2001.\n\nMontague\u2019s method of defining fragments with a fully explicit\nsyntax has become far less popular than it was in the heyday of\nMontague Grammar in the 1980s. Nowadays semanticists prefer to focus\non specific phenomena, suggesting rules which are only explicit\nconcerning the semantic side. This tendency has been criticized by\nPartee in Janssen 1997 and Jacobson 2014, where a fragment is actually\nprovided.\n",
