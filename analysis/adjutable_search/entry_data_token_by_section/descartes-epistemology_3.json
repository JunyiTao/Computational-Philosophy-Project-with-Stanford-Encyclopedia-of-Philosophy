    "main_text": "Conception of Knowledge || Innate Ideas\n1.4 Innate Ideas\n\nDescartes\u2019 commitment to innate ideas places him in a\nrationalist tradition tracing back to Plato. Knowledge of the nature\nof reality derives from ideas of the intellect, not the external\nsenses. An important part of metaphysical inquiry therefore involves\nlearning to think with the intellect. Plato\u2019s allegory of the\ncave portrays this rationalist theme in terms of epistemically\ndistinct worlds: what the senses reveal is likened to shadowy imagery\non the wall of a poorly lit cave; what the intellect reveals is\nlikened to a world of fully real beings illuminated by bright\nsunshine. The metaphor aptly depicts our epistemic predicament given\nDescartes\u2019 own doctrines. An important function of his methods\nis to help would-be perfect knowers redirect their attention from the\nconfused imagery of the senses to the luminous world of clear and\ndistinct ideas of the intellect.\n\nFurther comparisons arise with Plato\u2019s doctrine of recollection.\nIn the Fifth Meditation, in connection with the discovery of innate\ntruths within, the meditator remarks: \u201con first discovering them\nit seems that I am not so much learning something new as remembering\nwhat I knew before\u201d (Med. 5, AT 7:64, CSM 2:44). Elsewhere\nDescartes adds, of innate truths: \n\n[W]e come to know them by the power of our own native intelligence,\nwithout any sensory experience. All geometrical truths are of this\nsort \u2013 not just the most obvious ones, but all the others,\nhowever abstruse they may appear. Hence, according to Plato, Socrates\nasks a slave boy about the elements of geometry and thereby makes the\nboy able to dig out certain truths from his own mind which he had not\npreviously recognized were there, thus attempting to establish the\ndoctrine of reminiscence. Our knowledge of God is of this sort. (May\n1643 letter To Voetius, AT 8b:166f, CSMK 222f)\n\n\nThe famous \u201cwax\u201d thought experiment of the Second\nMeditation is supposed to illustrate (among other things) a procedure\nto \u201cdig out\u201d what is innate. The thought experiment\npurports to help the meditator achieve a \u201cpurely mental\nscrutiny,\u201d thereby apprehending more easily the innate idea of\nbody (Med. 2, AT 7:30f, CSM 2:20f). According to Descartes, our minds\ncome stocked with a variety of intellectual concepts \u2013 ideas\nwhose content is independent of experience. This storehouse includes\nideas in mathematics, logic, and metaphysics. Interestingly, Descartes\nholds that even our sensory ideas involve innate content. On his\nunderstanding of the new mechanical physics, bodies have no real\nproperties resembling our sensory ideas of colors, sounds, tastes, and\nthe like, thus implying that the content of such ideas draws from the\nmind itself. But if even these sensory ideas count as innate, \nhow then are we to characterize the doctrine of innateness? \nImportantly, the formation of these sensory ideas \u2013 unlike\npurely intellectual concepts \u2013 depends on sensory stimulation.\nOn one plausible understanding, Descartes\u2019 official doctrine\nhas it that ideas are innate insofar as their content derives \nfrom the nature of the mind alone, as opposed to deriving from sense \nexperience (cf. Newman 2006). This characterization allows that both \nintellectual and sensory concepts draw on native resources, though not \nto the same extent.\n\nThough the subject of rationalism or nativism\nin Descartes\u2019 epistemology deserves careful attention, the\npresent article generally focuses on Descartes\u2019 efforts to \nachieve perfect knowledge. Relatively little attention is given to\nhis doctrine of innateness, or, more generally, his ontology of \nthought. (For further discussion of his commitment to innateness, \nsee Adams 1975, Jolley 1990, Newman 2006, and Nelson 2007.)\n",
