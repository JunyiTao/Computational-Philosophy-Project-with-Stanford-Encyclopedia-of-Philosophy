    "main_text": "Default Interpretations in Semantics and Pragmatics || Defaults, the Said, and the Unsaid\n1.1 Defaults, the Said, and the Unsaid\n\nIn post-Gricean pragmatics it has been accepted that communicators\nconvey more information than is contained in the expressions they\nutter. For example, sentences (1a)\u2013(2a) normally convey\n(1b)\u2013(2b).\n\n(1a) Tom finished writing a paper and went skating.\n(1b) Tom finished writing a paper and then went skating.\n(2a) Picasso\u2019s painting is of a crying woman.\n(2b) The painting executed by Picasso is of a crying woman.\n\nSuch additions to the content of the uttered sentence were called by\nGrice (1975) generalized conversational implicatures (GCIs),\nthat is, instances of context-independent pragmatic inference.\nSubsequently, the status of such context-independent additions has\nbecome the subject of heated debates. Some post-Griceans stay close to\nGrice\u2019s spirit and propose that there are salient, unmarked,\npresumed meanings that occur independently of context (Horn, e.g.,\n2004, 2012; Levinson 1995, 2000; Recanati 2004). Some identify default\nmeanings as those arising automatically in a given situation of\ndiscourse (Jaszczolt, e.g., 2005, 2010, 2016b; Elder & Jaszczolt\n2016). Others reject defaults tout court and subsume such\nsalient meanings under a rather broad category of context-dependent\npragmatic inference (Sperber & Wilson 1986; Carston 2002).\n\nNext, some, following Grice, consider such pragmatic contributions to\nutterance meaning to be generalized conversational implicatures\n(Levinson), others classify them as pragmatic input to what is said,\nalbeit using a variety of theory-specific labels (Recanati, Carston),\nreserving the term \u2018implicature\u2019 for meanings that can be\nrepresented by a separate logical form and that function independently\nfrom the content of the main utterance in reasoning. Others define\nthem as contributions to primary meanings where the latter cut across\nthe explicit/implicit divide (Jaszczolt). Yet another possibility is\nto regard them as a separate level of what is implicit in what is said\n(Bach 1994, 2007; Horn 2006). In short, the status of such\n\u2018default\u2019 meanings is still far from clear. However, at\nleast in general terms, there is a reason for drawing a distinction\nbetween salient, automatic enrichments and costly pragmatic inference\nsince some of these pragmatic contributions go through\nnormally, unnoticed, as a matter of course. As Horn (2004:\n4\u20135) puts it,\n\nWhatever the theoretical status of the distinction, it is apparent\nthat some implicatures are induced only in a special context\n(\u2026), while others go through unless a special context\nis present \u2026.\n\nIn the above, the differences in using the term \u2018default\u2019\nconsist of the acceptance or rejection of at least the following\nproperties:\n\ncancellability (also known as defeasibility) of preferred\ninterpretations;\navailability of preferred interpretations without making use of\nconscious inference;\nshorter time required for their formation by the speaker and\nrecognition by the addressee as compared with that required for the\nmeanings induced through inference;\nthe availability of preferred interpretations prior to the\ncompletion of the processing of the entire proposition (local,\npre-propositional defaults).\n\n\nWhen analysed in standard truth-conditional semantics, defaults can\ncontribute to the truth-conditional content or affect what is implicit\n\u2013 presupposed or implicated (see e.g., Potts 2015). The side on\nwhich we find defaults in this distinction is largely dictated by the\norientation concerning the semantics/pragmatics boundary, where the\nchoice ranges from traditional semantic minimalism to radical versions\nof contextualism. I discuss these in more detail in the following\nsections. But it has to be remembered that the category is tangential\nto such concepts as what is said, conversational implicature,\nconventional implicature, presupposition, or, to use a more general\nterm, projective content (on universals in projective content see\nTonhauser et al. 2013). For example, presuppositions are\nstronger than defaults: presupposition triggers such as\n\u2018know\u2019, \u2018regret\u2019, \u2018again\u2019 or\n\u2018manage\u2019 do not give the hearer much option of\ninterpretation, save admitting some form of metalinguistic or\nquotative reading when these are negated as in (3).\n\n(3) I didn\u2019t forget about your birthday again; it is\n    the first time it happened.\n\nWhat is said can rely on various types of defaults (Section 2) and\ncontextually salient interpretations (Section 3), but likewise it can\nrely on effortful pragmatic inference from a variety of sources\navailable in the situation of discourse. Relevant implicatures can be\nconventional (Grice 1975; Potts 2005) and conversational generalised,\nthe latter understood either as grammar-driven (Chierchia 2004) or,\nmore loosely, language-system-driven (Levinson 2000 and Section 1.3),\nbut implicatures can also be entirely context-dependent\n(particularised). To add to this multi-dimensionality,\ncontext-dependent implicatures can on some occasions arise\nautomatically, so when our definition of defaults relies on the\ndefinitional criterion of the automaticity of the process, as\ndiscussed above, then, by this definition, such implicatures can also\nbe dubbed \u2018defaults\u2019 (Giora & Givoni 2015; Jaszczolt\n2016a). In short, pursuing the standard route of analysing the types\nof content will not get us far with analysing defaults.\nSaid/implicated, at-issue, or question-under-discussion-driven\nanalyses (e.g., Roberts 2004) will encounter defaults on either side of\nthe pertinent dichotomies.\n\nA further complication in linking defaultness with the categories of\nthe said or the unsaid is the fact that even weak implicatures or\npresuppositions adopted through accommodation can enjoy either status.\nIn (4), we can accommodate globally the presupposition in (5) \u2013\neither via inference or automatically.\n\n(4) Tom says that Ian hasn\u2019t finished writing a novel.\n(5) Ian is writing a novel.\n\nAs a result, (5) can enjoy the default status according to some of the\nstandard understandings of defaults as automatic, or more frequent,\nmore salient, or even more \u2018literal\u2019 interpretations, or,\nalternatively, it can simply be an interpretation that is easier to\nprocess \u2013 arguably, in itself a plausible criterion for\n\u2018defaultness\u2019.\n\nNext, conventional implicatures, that is lexical meanings that,\naccording to Grice (1975), do not contribute to what is said, have, at\nfirst glance, less to do with defaultness: they are entrenched,\nnon-cancellable and form-dependent (detachable), and they cannot be\ncalculated from maxims, principles or heuristics (Horn 1988: 123).\nHowever, more recent inquiries into the related category of\nexpressives gives more scope for pursuing defaultness. Slurs are,\narguably, offensive by default but their derogatory import does not\ncarry across to context of banter and camaraderie. As to whether the\nexpressive content is an implicature or part of what is said, the\nmatter is still hotly discussed (see e.g., Richard 2008; Sileo 2017).\nIn what follows, I try to bring some order into this unwieldy term\nvis-\u00e0-vis the semantics/pragmatics distinction and finish with\nsome reflections on its usefulness for semantics and pragmatics.\n",
