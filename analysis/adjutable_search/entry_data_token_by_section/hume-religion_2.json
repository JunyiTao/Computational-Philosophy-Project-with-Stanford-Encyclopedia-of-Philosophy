The Cosmological Argument and God\u2019s Necessary-Existence\n\nIn Lucretius\u2019s The Nature of the Universe \u2013 which\nis the greatest classical statement of a system of atheism \u2013 it\nis argued that it is impossible that matter was created and that it\nmust, therefore, be eternal and uncreated. The basis of this argument\nis the general causal principle: \u201cNothing can come from\nnothing\u201d [Ex nihilo, nihil fit.] In the late\n17th and early 18th centuries this principle was\nturned against the Epicurean atheism of thinkers such as Lucretius and\nhis modern counterparts. More specifically, the principle\n\u201cNothing can come from nothing\u201d was taken to ground two\nderived principles of causal reasoning. The first is the causal maxim:\nWhatever exists must have a cause or ground for its\nexistence. The second principle is that of causal adequacy or the\norder of causes: No cause can produce or give rise to perfections\nor excellences that it does not itself possess. These two\n(derived) causal principles were used by religious philosophers like\nCudworth, Locke and Clarke as the philosophical foundation for their\nown versions of the cosmological argument. It fell to Hume to argue\nthat the causal foundations of this argument were too weak to support\nthe philosophical weight placed upon them.\n\nHume\u2019s most explicit assault on the cosmological argument\nappears in Part IX of his Dialogues. In this context, he\nspecifically mentions Clarke and condenses his argument into a few\nsentences:\n\nWhatever exists must have a cause or reason of its existence; it being\nabsolutely impossible for any thing to produce itself, or to be the\ncause of its own existence. In mounting up, therefore, from effects to\ncauses, we must either go on in tracing an infinite succession,\nwithout any ultimate cause at all, or must at last have recourse to\nsome ultimate cause, that is necessarily existent\u2026 (D,\n9.3/188 \u2014 Hume\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nThere cannot be an infinite succession of causes and effects without\nany ultimate cause at all, the argument runs, because this would fail\nto provide any cause or reason for the whole series or causal chain.\nThat is to say, we need to explain \u201cwhy this particular\nsuccession of causes existed from eternity, and not any other\nsuccession, or no succession at all.\u201d Clearly the series cannot\nbe produced by nothing. We may conclude, therefore, that the universe\nmust have arisen from some \u201cnecessarily existent Being, who\ncarries the Reason of his existence in himself; and who cannot be\nsupposed not to exist without an express contradiction.\u201d (D,\n9.3/189). This necessarily existent being is God.\n\nIt is also essential to this argument to prove that the\nnecessarily-existent being cannot be (unintelligent, inactive) matter.\nClarke\u2019s argument, as paraphrased by Hume, is based on the\ncontingency of matter and particular form of the world.\n\n\u201cAny particle of matter\u201d, it is said, \u201cmay be\nconceived to be annihilated; and any form may be conceived to be\naltered.\u201d Such an annihilation or alteration, therefore, is not\nimpossible. (D, 9.7/190)\n\n\nAnother argument that Clarke provides (not mentioned by Hume in the\nDialogues) to show that it is impossible for matter to be\n\u201cthe final and original being\u201d is that we cannot explain\nthe origin of motion and intelligence in the world if matter is the\nfirst, original self-existing being. The basic principle that Clarke\nrelies on to establish this conclusion is, once again, that\n\u201cnothing can come from nothing\u201d. In this case the\nprinciple is interpreted as implying that \u201cin order of causes\nand effects, the cause must always be more excellent than the\neffect.\u201d [Clarke, Demonstration, 38] It is impossible,\non this account, \u201cthat any effect should have any perfection,\nwhich was not in the cause\u201d. On the basis of this principle\n\u2014 the causal adequacy principle \u2014 Clarke and other\nlike-minded thinkers maintained that it is demonstratively certain\nthat matter and motion cannot produce thought and intelligence.\nTherefore, the original, self-existent being must be an intelligent,\nimmaterial being. To suppose the contrary, they claim, would be a\nplain contradiction.\n\nIt is evident that the foundations of this argument rest with the\nrelated causal principles that everything must have a cause or ground\nfor its existence and that no effect can have any perfection that is\nnot also in its cause. To deny either of these causal principles is,\non Clarke\u2019s account, to reject the more general principle that\n\u201cnothing can come from nothing\u201d (a principle that the\natheists such as Lucretius have themselves acknowledged). In the\nTreatise Hume develops an account of causation that directly\ncontradicts these causal principles. Contrary to the causal maxim,\nHume maintains, it is entirely possible for us to conceive of\nsomething beginning to exist without any cause. To deny this implies\nno contradiction and, therefore, this principle is neither intuitively\nnor demonstratively certain (T, 1.3.3/78\u20139). Granting that\nwhatever is conceivable or non-contradictory is possible, it follows\nthat it is possible that there exists a causal series that came into\nexistence uncreated or has always existed without any further cause or\nground for its existence. \n\nJust as Hume rejects the claim that it is absurd or contradictory to\ndeny that there must be a cause for everything that comes into\nexistence, he also denies that it is impossible for an effect to have\nperfections that its cause lacks. Contrary to this view, Hume\nmaintains, \u201cany thing may produce any thing\u201d (T, 1.3.15.1/\n173; 1.4.5.30/247\u20138; EU, 12.29/ 164). All that there is to\ncausation, as we experience and know it, is the constant conjunction\nor regular succession of resembling objects. In other words, to say X\ncauses Y is to say that in our experience we discover that objects\nresembling X\u2019s are always prior to and contiguous with objects\nresembling Y\u2019s (T, 1.3.14.28\u201331/ 168\u201370). Our idea\nof causation as it exists in the world reaches no further than this.\n(See the entry on\n the metaphysics of causation.)\n On this basis Hume argues:\n\nCreation, annihilation, motion, reason, volition; all these may arise\nfrom one another, or from any other object we can imagine. (T,\n1.3.15.1/173; cp. 1.4.5.30/247)\n\n\nIn this way, Hume stands Lucretius on his head with a view to refuting\nthose \u201creligious philosophers\u201d who aimed to refute\nLucretius\u2019s atheism using his own causal principle:\n\nThat impious maxim of the ancient philosophy, Ex nihilo, nihil\nfit, by which the creation of matter was excluded, ceases to be a\nmaxim, according to my philosophy. Not only the will of the supreme\nBeing may create matter; but, for aught we know a priori, the\nwill of any other being might create it, or any other cause, that the\nmost whimsical imagination can assign. (EU, 12.29n/164n)\n\n\nClearly, however, under cover of rejecting Lucretius\u2019s general\ncausal principle, Hume has established that a priori it is not\nimpossible for matter and motion to produce thought and consciousness.\nOn the contrary, not only is it a priori possible for matter to be as\n\u201cactive\u201d as thought and consciousness, and actually\nproduce thought and consciousness, this is exactly what we discover\nfrom experience (T, 1.4.5.31/248\u20139). The clear implication of\nall this is that there is no basis for the a priori claim that the\nmaterial world is incapable of activity or producing thought and\nconsciousness. Indeed, experience shows that this claim is actually\nfalse. There is, therefore, no basis for the a priori claim that there\nnecessarily exists an original, self-existing being that is an\nimmaterial, intelligent being (i.e., God).\n\nClosely related to Hume\u2019s critique of all efforts to demonstrate\nthe existence of any being by means of a priori reasoning, is his\ncritique of the notion of necessary-existence in general. In the\nDialogues Hume explains his position as follows:\n\n\u2026 there is an evident absurdity in pretending to demonstrate a\nmatter of fact, or to prove it by arguments a priori. Nothing is\ndemonstrable, unless the contrary is a contradiction. Nothing, that is\ndirectly conceivable, implies a contradiction. Whatever we conceive as\nexistent, we can also conceive as non-existent. There is no being,\ntherefore, whose non-existence implies a contradiction. Consequently\nthere is no Being whose contradiction is demonstrable. (D, 9.5/189;\ncp, EU,12.28\u201334/ 164\u20135)\n\n\nAs Hume puts the point in the Treatise, when we believe that\nGod exists our \u201cidea of him neither encreases nor\ndiminishes\u201d \u2014 we simply conceive of \u201cthe idea of\nsuch, as he is represented to us\u201d in a more forceful or vivid\nmanner (T, 1.3.7.2/94; cp. 1.3.7.5n/96n). We join nothing to our idea\nof his parts or qualities, nor do we have a distinct and separate idea\nof existence itself (e.g., qua abstract idea). In so far as we have\nany clear idea of God we can conceive of him existing or not existing.\nFrom these observations Hume draws the conclusion that the words\n\u201cnecessary existence, have no meaning; or what is the same\nthing, none that is consistent\u201d (D, 9.6/190).\n\nHume applies this point directly to the claim that \u201cthe material\nworld is not the necessarily existent Being\u201d. If it is possible\nto conceive of the material world as not existing the same is true of\nGod: we can imagine him \u201cto be non-existent, or his attributes\nto be altered\u201d (D, 9.7/190). If God\u2019s non-existence is\nimpossible because of some \u201cunknown inconceivable\nqualities\u201d, why should we assume that these qualities do not\nbelong to matter? All this puts an end to the efforts of Clarke and\nlikeminded \u201creligious philosophers\u201d to prove that God\nnecessarily-exists.\n\nAnother argument that Hume presents, in criticism of the cosmological\nargument, concerns the assumption that an infinite series of causes\nand effects requires some explanation or cause for its existence.\n\n\u2026 The WHOLE, you say, wants a cause. I answer, that the uniting\nof these parts into a whole, like the uniting of several distinct\ncounties into one kingdom, or several distinct members into one body,\nis performed merely by an arbitrary act of mind, and has no influence\non the nature of things. Did I show you the particular cause of each\nindividual in a collection of twenty particles of matter, I should\nthink it very unreasonable, should you afterwards ask me, what was the\ncause of the whole twenty. This is sufficiently explained in\nexplaining the cause of the parts. (D, 9.9/190\u20131)\n\n\nThe step in this argument that seems most questionable is the claim\nthat because each element in the causal chain has been explained, in\nterms of some earlier member of the chain, we have \u201csufficiently\nexplained\u201d why there exists any such chain or why this\nparticular chain exists. Critics will argue that this has plainly not\nbeen done. One response to this is argue that it is a philosophical\nmistake to look for an explanation of this kind, on the ground that a\ncause must be prior to its effect in time and it is evident that\nnothing can be prior to a series of causes and effects that is without\nany beginning or exists for eternity (D, 9.8/190). Related to this\npoint, it may also be argued, more generally, that it is impossible\nfor us to frame any idea of Creation (i.e., God creating the whole\nworld) because our idea of causation presupposes a framework of ideas\nthat already requires the existence of objects in the world\n(cp.T,1.3.15.1\u201310/ 173\u20134). That is to say, it is a mistake\nto conceive of the cosmological question in causal terms because this\ntakes us beyond the scope of human ideas and understanding.\nHume\u2019s general analysis of the nature of causation, as developed\nin the Treatise and first Enquiry, makes clear that\nthis is his view of this matter. For human beings, therefore, given\nour epistemological limits, the existence of this world must be\ntreated as a basic brute fact that is incapable (for us) of further\nexplanation.\n\nFinally, Hume\u2019s against the notion of necessary existence have\nobvious relevance also for Descartes\u2019s effort, in\nMeditations III, to prove that God necessarily exists by way\nof reasoning from our (innate) idea of God. Since a priori any thing\nmay cause any thing, it follows that even if we had an idea of a\nperfect being there would be no basis for the claim that God must be\nthe source of this idea. Similarly, since we have no (abstract) idea\nof existence, distinct from the conception of particular objects,\nthere is no basis for claiming, as does Descartes in\nMeditations V, that the idea of God implies his actual\nexistence. Whatever idea of God we are able to frame is an idea of\nsomething that we can conceive of as either existing or not existing.\nExistence is not some further quality or \u201cperfection\u201d\nwhich a being possesses along with its other attributes. There is,\ntherefore, no contradiction involved in denying that God exists.\n",
