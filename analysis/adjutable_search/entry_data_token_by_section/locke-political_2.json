    "main_text": "Property\n3. Property\n\nLocke\u2019s treatment of property is generally thought to be among\nhis most important contributions in political thought, but it is also\none of the aspects of his thought that has been most heavily\ncriticized. There are important debates over what exactly Locke was\ntrying to accomplish with his theory. One interpretation, advanced by\nC.B. Macpherson (1962), sees Locke as a defender of unrestricted\ncapitalist accumulation. On Macpherson\u2019s interpretation, Locke\nis thought to have set three restrictions on the accumulation of\nproperty in the state of nature: (1) one may only appropriate as much\nas one can use before it spoils (Two Treatises 2.31), (2) one\nmust leave \u201cenough and as good\u201d for others (the\nsufficiency restriction) (2.27), and (3) one may (supposedly) only\nappropriate property through one\u2019s own labor (2.27). Macpherson\nclaims that as the argument progresses, each of these restrictions is\ntranscended. The spoilage restriction ceases to be a meaningful\nrestriction with the invention of money because value can be stored in\na medium that does not decay (2.46\u201347). The sufficiency\nrestriction is transcended because the creation of private property so\nincreases productivity that even those who no longer have the\nopportunity to acquire land will have more opportunity to acquire what\nis necessary for life (2.37). According to Macpherson\u2019s view,\nthe \u201cenough and as good\u201d requirement is itself merely a\nderivative of a prior principle guaranteeing the opportunity to\nacquire, through labor, the necessities of life. The third\nrestriction, Macpherson argues, was not one Locke actually held at\nall. Though Locke appears to suggest that one can only have property\nin what one has personally labored on when he makes labor the source\nof property rights, Locke clearly recognized that even in the state of\nnature, \u201cthe Turfs my Servant has cut\u201d (2.28) can become\nmy property. Locke, according to Macpherson, thus clearly recognized\nthat labor can be alienated. As one would guess, Macpherson is\ncritical of the \u201cpossessive individualism\u201d that\nLocke\u2019s theory of property represents. He argues that its\ncoherence depends upon the assumption of differential rationality\nbetween capitalists and wage-laborers and on the division of society\ninto distinct classes. Because Locke was bound by these constraints,\nwe are to understand him as including only property owners as voting\nmembers of society.\n\nMacpherson\u2019s understanding of Locke has been criticized from\nseveral different directions. Alan Ryan (1965) argued that since\nproperty for Locke includes life and liberty as well as estate\n(Two Treatises 2.87), even those without land could still be\nmembers of political society. The dispute between the two would then\nturn on whether Locke was using \u201cproperty\u201d in the more\nexpansive sense in some of the crucial passages. James Tully (1980)\nattacked Macpherson\u2019s interpretation by pointing out that the\nFirst Treatise specifically includes a duty of charity toward\nthose who have no other means of subsistence (1.42). While this duty\nis consistent with requiring the poor to work for low wages, it does\nundermine the claim that those who have wealth have no social\nduties to others.\n\nTully also argued for a fundamental reinterpretation of Locke\u2019s\ntheory. Previous accounts had focused on the claim that since persons\nown their own labor, when they mix their labor with that which is\nunowned it becomes their property. Robert Nozick (1974) criticized\nthis argument with his famous example of mixing tomato juice one\nrightfully owns with the sea. When we mix what we own with what we do\nnot, why should we think we gain property instead of losing it? On\nTully\u2019s account, focus on the mixing metaphor misses\nLocke\u2019s emphasis on what he calls the \u201cworkmanship\nmodel.\u201d Locke believed that makers have property rights with\nrespect to what they make just as God has property rights with respect\nto human beings because he is their maker. Human beings are created in\nthe image of God and share with God, though to a much lesser extent,\nthe ability to shape and mold the physical environment in accordance\nwith a rational pattern or plan. Waldron (1988) has criticized this\ninterpretation on the grounds that it would make the rights of human\nmakers absolute in the same way that God\u2019s right over his\ncreation is absolute. Sreenivasan (1995) has defended Tully\u2019s\nargument against Waldron\u2019s response by claiming a distinction\nbetween creating and making. Only creating generates an absolute\nproperty right, and only God can create, but making is analogous to\ncreating and creates an analogous, though weaker, right.\n\nAnother controversial aspect of Tully\u2019s interpretation of Locke\nis his interpretation of the sufficiency condition and its\nimplications. On his analysis, the sufficiency argument is crucial for\nLocke\u2019s argument to be plausible. Since Locke begins with the\nassumption that the world is owned by all, individual property is only\njustified if it can be shown that no one is made worse off by the\nappropriation. In conditions where the good taken is not scarce, where\nthere is much water or land available, an individual\u2019s taking\nsome portion of it does no harm to others. Where this condition is not\nmet, those who are denied access to the good do have a legitimate\nobjection to appropriation. According to Tully, Locke realized that as\nsoon as land became scarce, previous rights acquired by labor no\nlonger held since \u201cenough and as good\u201d was no longer\navailable for others. Once land became scarce, property could only be\nlegitimated by the creation of political society.\n\nWaldron (1988) claims that, contrary to Macpherson (1962), Tully\n(1980), and others, Locke did not recognize a sufficiency condition at\nall. He notes that, strictly speaking, Locke makes sufficiency a\nsufficient rather than necessary condition when he says that labor\ngenerates a title to property \u201cat least where there is enough,\nand as good left in common for others\u201d (Two Treatises\n2.27). Waldron takes Locke to be making a descriptive statement, not a\nnormative one, about the conditions that initially existed. Waldron\nalso argues that in the text \u201cenough and as good\u201d is not\npresented as a restriction and is not grouped with other restrictions.\nWaldron thinks that the condition would lead Locke to the absurd\nconclusion that in circumstances of scarcity everyone must starve to\ndeath since no one would be able to obtain universal consent and any\nappropriation would make others worse off.\n\nOne of the strongest defenses of Tully\u2019s position is presented\nby Sreenivasan (1995). He argues that Locke\u2019s repetitious use of\n\u201cenough and as good\u201d indicates that the phrase is doing\nsome real work in the argument. In particular, it is the only way\nLocke can be thought to have provided some solution to the fact that\nthe consent of all is needed to justify appropriation in the state of\nnature. If others are not harmed, they have no grounds to object and\ncan be thought to consent, whereas if they are harmed, it is\nimplausible to think of them as consenting. Sreenivasan does depart\nfrom Tully in some important respects. He takes \u201cenough and as\ngood\u201d to mean \u201cenough and as good opportunity for securing\none\u2019s preservation,\u201d not \u201cenough and as good of the\nsame commodity (such as land).\u201d This has the advantage of making\nLocke\u2019s account of property less radical since it does not claim\nthat Locke thought the point of his theory was to show that all\noriginal property rights were invalid at the point where political\ncommunities were created. The disadvantage of this interpretation, as\nSreenivasan admits, is that it saddles Locke with a flawed argument.\nThose who merely have the opportunity to labor for others at\nsubsistence wages no longer have the liberty that individuals had\nbefore scarcity to benefit from the full surplus of value they create.\nMoreover, poor laborers no longer enjoy equality of access to the\nmaterials from which products can be made. Sreenivasan thinks that\nLocke\u2019s theory is thus unable to solve the problem of how\nindividuals can obtain individual property rights in what is initially\nowned by all people without consent.\n\nSimmons (1992) presents a still different synthesis. He sides with\nWaldron (1988) and against Tully (1980) and Sreenivasan (1995) in\nrejecting the workmanship model. He claims that the references to\n\u201cmaking\u201d in chapter five of the Two Treatises are\nnot making in the right sense of the word for the workmanship model to\nbe correct. Locke thinks we have property in our own persons even\nthough we do not make or create ourselves. Simmons claims that while\nLocke did believe that God had rights as creator, human beings have a\ndifferent limited right as trustees, not as makers. Simmons\nbases this in part on his reading of two distinct arguments he takes\nLocke to make: the first justifies property based on God\u2019s will\nand basic human needs, the second based on \u201cmixing\u201d labor.\nAccording to the former argument, at least some property rights can be\njustified by showing that a scheme allowing appropriation of property\nwithout consent has beneficial consequences for the preservation of\nmankind. This argument is overdetermined, according to Simmons, in\nthat it can be interpreted either theologically or as a simple\nrule-consequentialist argument. With respect to the latter argument,\nSimmons takes labor not to be a substance that is literally\n\u201cmixed\u201d but rather as a purposive activity aimed at\nsatisfying needs and conveniences of life. Like Sreenivasan, Simmons\nsees this as flowing from a prior right of people to secure their\nsubsistence, but Simmons also adds a prior right to self-government.\nLabor can generate claims to private property because private property\nmakes individuals more independent and able to direct their own\nactions. Simmons thinks Locke\u2019s argument is ultimately flawed\nbecause he underestimated the extent to which wage labor would make\nthe poor dependent on the rich, undermining self-government. He also\njoins the chorus of those who find Locke\u2019s appeal to consent to\nthe introduction of money inadequate to justify the very unequal\nproperty holdings that now exist.\n\nSome authors have suggested that Locke may have had an additional\nconcern in mind in writing the chapter on property. Tully (1993) and\nBarbara Arneil (1996) point out that Locke was interested in and\ninvolved in the affairs of the American colonies and that\nLocke\u2019s theory of labor led to the convenient conclusion that\nthe labor of Native Americans generated property rights only over the\nanimals they caught, not the land on which they hunted which Locke\nregarded as vacant and available for the taking. David Armitage (2004)\neven argues that there is evidence that Locke was actively involved in\nrevising the  Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina  at the\nsame time he was drafting the chapter on property for the Second\nTreatise. Mark Goldie (1983), however, cautions that we should\nnot miss the fact that political events in England were still\nLocke\u2019s primary focus in writing the the Second\nTreatise. \n\nA final question concerns the status of those property rights acquired\nin the state of nature after civil society has come into being. It\nseems clear that at the very least Locke allows taxation to take place\nby the consent of the majority rather than requiring unanimous consent\n(2.140). Nozick (1974) takes Locke to be a libertarian, with the\ngovernment having no right to take property to use for the common good\nwithout the consent of the property owner. On his interpretation, the\nmajority may only tax at the rate needed to allow the government to\nsuccessfully protect property rights. At the other extreme, Tully\n(1980) thinks that, by the time government is formed, land is already\nscarce and so the initial holdings of the state of nature are no\nlonger valid and thus are no constraint on governmental action.\nWaldron\u2019s (1988) view is in between these, acknowledging that\nproperty rights are among the rights from the state of nature that\ncontinue to constrain the government, but seeing the legislature as\nhaving the power to interpret what natural law requires in this matter\nin a fairly substantial way.\n",
