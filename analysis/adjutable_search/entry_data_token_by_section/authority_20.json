    "main_text": "Reasonable Consensus Conceptions of Legitimate Political Authority || Problems of Reasonableness and Consensus\n5.1 Problems of Reasonableness and Consensus\n\n\nA number of criticisms have been made against this kind of view.\nMany have argued that the relevant notion of reasonableness is likely\nto be very difficult to specify in a way that is both plausible and\ncompatible with possible consensus. The key difficulty with reasonable\nconsensus theories is that they rely on the possibility of consensus on\nat least a sufficient number of basic norms to say that there is\nconsensus on the basic principles that regulate a society. So if one\nattempts to come up with a notion of reasonableness that is\nsufficiently robust to generate agreement of this sort, then one is\nlikely to have a notion that is quite controversial. And then the view\ndoes not seem to take a sufficiently respectful view of the opinions of\nthe members of society since so many are likely to disagree with the\nconception of the reasonable. On the other hand, if one elaborates a\nconception of the reasonable that is sufficiently weak for most persons\nin the society to satisfy it, then one is not likely to generate\nagreement on the basic principles of the society.\n\n\nThe main worry is that the idea demands a level of consensus among\nmembers of society that is incompatible with the ordinary conditions of\npolitical societies (Christiano 1996; Waldron 1999). The principle\ndemands that there be a kind of consensus among citizens on the basic\nprinciples that underpin the operation of political society.\n\n\nThis consensus seems to be unattainable under the conditions of\nmodern society. One way, however, in which Rawls has argued in favor of\nthe attainability of the consensus is to say that it need only be an\noverlapping consensus. The idea here is that citizens do not have to\nagree on everything but only on those principles that apply to the\nbasic structure of society. And even here, when citizens disagree on\nsome issue of social justice, the opposing views are taken off the\ntable. So citizens can disagree on what the nature of the good life is\nand on religious questions and even different issues relating to social\njustice. As long as there are certain principles that everyone agrees\nto, which apply to the basic structure of society, full consensus is\nnot necessary. Hence, the consensus need only be an overlapping\none.\n\n\nThough this idea goes some way towards alleviating the worry that\ntoo much consensus is required by Rawls's theory, it does not go nearly\nfar enough. There is one main way in which the overlapping consensus\nfails to provide the kind of consensus that Rawls requires. If a group\nof citizens agrees on a set of principles for regulating society and\nsome of the citizens also think that some other principles apply, the\noverlapping consensus idea is that the citizens who hold the\nidiosyncratic views must take those particular demands off the table\nand must argue only on the basis of the shared principles. The idea is\nthat everyone appeals only to those principles that lie in the overlap\nand not to those that do not lie in the overlap. A legitimate exercise\nof political power is one that is grounded only in those principles\nthat lie in the overlap. This seems to diminish the amount of agreement\nnecessary to make a society legitimate.\n\n\nBut this appearance is an illusion. To see this we need only think\nof those people who hold idiosyncratic views. If the society they live\nin is exclusively grounded in principles that lie in the overlap of\nprinciples, then these people will have reason to complain that the\nsociety is unjust to the extent that the idiosyncratic principles are\nignored. For instance, if someone holds the idiosyncratic view that\npeople ought to receive in accordance with their desert then a society\nthat does not act to make sure that this principle is respected is one\nthat will be considered unjust by that person. They will live in a\nsociety that is unacceptable to them in a certain important respect\nrelevant to justice.\n\n\nOf course, if the desert principle is used to ground the basic\ninstitutions of society even though it does not lie in the overlap then\nthose who think that desert is not a proper principle of justice will\nlikely think that they are living in a society that they regard as\nunjust. The principle of legitimacy will imply in this context that the\nbasic institutions of society are illegitimate because they are not\nbased on principles everyone accepts. But surely the same can be said\nof those who hold the idiosyncratic principles. They can complain that\nthey are required to go along with institutions that are unjust by\ntheir lights. The imposition on them implied by the basic institutions\nthat fail to distribute in accordance with desert is as great as would\nbe the imposition on the others implied by institutions that do\ndistribute goods in accordance with desert. There is a complete\nsymmetry here. Indeed, one way to put this point is to say that those\nwho hold that desert is not a genuine principle of justice are\nthemselves holding an idiosyncratic view when we take into account the\nfact that many think that desert is a genuine principle of justice.\n\n\nAs a consequence of these considerations, only a complete consensus\nof political principles will satisfy the principle of legitimacy that\nRawls defends. But complete consensus on political principles is\nimpossible to achieve given the conditions of ordinary political\nsocieties. And so to the extent that this principle of legitimacy is\nunsatisfiable in ordinary political societies, it appears to be an\nunacceptably utopian principle. In particular, it seems to be an\nunacceptable principle of political legitimacy because a principle of\npolitical legitimacy is partly framed for the purpose of according\nmoral credentials to a society in the circumstances of political\ndisagreement.\n",
