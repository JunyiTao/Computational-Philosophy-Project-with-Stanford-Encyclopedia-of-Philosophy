    "main_text": "On Nature || Cosmogony\n2.2 Cosmogony\n\nCosmogony is due to the interplay of the four roots and the two\nforces. Each of the roots has its specific nature. Some\u2014like\nfire and water\u2014are traditionally seen as antagonistic;\nothers\u2014like fire and air\u2014are seen as compatible. However,\nEmpedocles did not think the specific natures of the roots could cause\nthem to organize themselves into a cosmos. Hence, he introduces Love\nand Strife. Love works by bringing together roots of different types\ninto harmony. It does so by instilling attraction among the different\ntypes of roots for one another; without Love, these roots would not\nnaturally cohere. While it is true that Love then pulls what is\nsimilar apart from what is similar, it does not do so by causing\nrepulsion for one another in similar roots. By contrast, Strife\naggregates similar roots together by instilling repulsion among\ndifferent types of roots for one another. The work of Strife is to\nreplace the attraction among different types of roots instilled by\nLove with repulsion. During the history of a cosmos, these forces are\nin contention, present together in waxing and waning strengths,\nthroughout the coming to be of the cosmos and its creatures and in\ntheir passing away.\n\nWhile all commentators take the passage at B17.1\u201313 (=D\n73.233\u2013244) as fundamental, their interpretations vary,\nsometimes widely. In the traditional sort of interpretation (see\nO\u2019Brien 1969, Wright 1981) this passage speaks about a two-part\nsymmetrical cosmic cycle, which endlessly repeats itself. We can trace\nthe history of one cycle, beginning with the point at which all the\nroots are united, completely intermingled and motionless under the\ntotal domination of Love, an image reminiscent of Parmenides\u2019\nspherical \u201cwhat-is\u201d. Then Strife enters and begins to\nseparate the roots out, until finally all are completely separated\ninto distinct, self-contained masses of fire, air, earth and water. At\nthis point, Love begins to unite the roots until, once again, they are\ncompletely intermingled and another cycle begins. In each half of the\ncycle, as the separation or unification proceeds, there is a cosmogony\n(generation of a cosmos or ordered world) and a zoogony (generation of\nanimals). In the first half-cycle, under the increasing influence of\nStrife, a cosmos and then animals come to be. In the second half,\nunder the increasing influence of Love, again a cosmos and animals\ncome to be. We will start with the traditional interpretations which\nhold that there are double cosmogonies and then look at the second\nstrain of interpretations where there is only one cosmogony.\n\nEmpedocles posits a stage in which Love is totally dominant and all\nthings are unified into a Sphere (B 27 and 29 = D 89 and 92). Since\nthis spherical unity includes the roots, they are presumably\nthoroughly intermingled with one another (for an alternative view,\nSedley 2016). The Sphere is the initial stage in the formation of the\ncosmos; it is not itself a cosmos. At this point, Strife begins to\ninsinuate itself into the Sphere (B 30 and 31 = D 94 and 95). The\noutcome is the separation of the roots into a cosmos (A 49 = D\n99a\u2013b). The latter requires a separation of roots into\nidentifiable masses of earth, air, water, and fire (B 38 = D 122),\neven though there might still be some (much diminished) presence of\neach root within each of the four masses. The roots of earth, water,\nair and fire would predominate in the respective masses, making them\nidentifiable as such. The mass of earth is at the center; water more\nor less surrounds the earth. Air forms the next layer. From fire at\nthe periphery, the sun comes to be as a distinct entity. This\ngeocentric formation is what the ancients usually recognized to be our\ncosmos. Since it is Strife that separates the roots, the cosmogony so\ndescribed is presumably dependent on Strife\u2019s influence.\n\nEmpedocles also describes a time when Strife has separated the roots.\nThis separation is total and is the opposite pole from the Sphere,\nwhich is a total mixture under the influence of Love.\n\n\n\nWhen Strife has reached the deepest depth \n\nOf the vortex, and Love has come to be in the center of the whirl, \n\nUnder her dominion all these [i.e., the elements] come together to be\nonly one, \n\nEach one coming from a different place, not brusquely, but willingly\n(B 35.20\u201323 = D 75.3\u20136) \n\n\nFirst of all, this somewhat mysterious description suggests that the\nmeans by which Strife separates the roots from the beginning is a\nvortex. Heavier elements like earth settle in the middle and lighter\nones like fire are pushed to the periphery. This reference to the\nvortex also implies that dominance by Strife is characterized by the\nwhirling motion of the cosmos as we know it. In addition, this\nfragment suggests the end of the rule of Strife and the beginning of\nthe rule of Love, as this principle begins to insinuate itself into\nthe elements. The latter part of this passage describes the unifying\neffect of Love. \n\nAt this point, we can start to consider the difference between\ntraditional and non-traditional interpretations of Empedocles\u2019\ncycle. While in traditional interpretations the separation by Strife,\nas described above in Fr. 30 and 31 (= D 94 and 95), produces at first\na cosmos, the continuing influence of Strife gradually increases the\nseparation. Eventually, when Strife is totally dominant as described\nin B35 (= D75), the roots are so thoroughly separated into their\nrespective places, each constituting a mass totally on its own, with\nno presence in it of any portion of any of the other roots, that the\ncosmos and all its movements are destroyed. These interpretations then\nhold that there is another cosmogony in the reverse progress from\ncomplete separation to complete unity, under the influence of Love.\nCertainly, the symmetry of the fundamental principle might suggest a\nsecond cosmogony. However, we do not find in the remains of\nEmpedocles\u2019 poem a description of another cosmogony, one taking\nplace under the influence of Love. Of course, that we do not find one\ndoes not mean that it did not exist, given the fragmentary nature of\nthe text. In fact, Aristotle suggests in a number of places (De\nCaelo II 13, 295a29; De Generatione et Corruptione II 7,\n334a5) that Empedocles was committed to such a second cosmogony. But\nhe says Empedocles shied away from holding to such a cosmogony because\nit is not reasonable to posit a cosmos coming to be from elements\nalready separated\u2014as though cosmogony can only happen through\nthe separation of elements out of a previously blended condition of\nthem all (De Caelo, III 2, 301a14). \n\nSuch issues lend weight to a second strain of interpretation (see Long\n1974, Bollack 1965\u20131969), which still reads the fundamental\nprinciple of B 17 (= D 73) as referring to alternating periods of\ndomination by Love and Strife. However, they hold that there is only\none cosmogony and one zoogony. In the vortex, Strife dominates in\norder to separate the roots into their respective places, shattering\nLove\u2019s Sphere. Strife\u2019s creation of separate elements\nallows for their recombination by Love to form a cosmos. As described\nabove, this would be a condition in which some portions of each of the\nother roots become intermingled. Love asserts her influence, forming\nthe cosmos (consisting of a world-order with continental land-masses,\noceans, rivers, winds, sun, moon, seasons, planets, stars, etc.). From\nthe mixture of roots in due proportions, there arise various forms of\nanimal life. Ultimately, both animals and cosmos perish as Love\ntotally reunifies the roots. Thus, finally, the Sphere is restored and\nthe cosmos ends. On this interpretation there is a single cosmogony\ngenerated by the increasing power of Love and a single zoogony under\nalternating dominance by Love and Strife. The idea of a single\ncosmogony and zoogony is attractive, in part, because it echoes other\nPresocratic philosophers.\n\nThe discovery and publication of twelfth-century Byzantine scholia on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics and On Generation and\nCorruption (Rashed 2001, 2014) that preserve an elaborate cosmic\ntime line for Love and Strife\u2019s rule has further divided\nscholarly opinion. The scholia record an increase of Love\u2019s\npower for sixty units of time; a perfect Sphere for forty units; and a\nrule of Strife lasting sixty units. Primavesi (2016) has linked this\nratio to Pythagorean number philosophy through the structure of a\ndouble tetractys. Nonetheless, the authenticity of the scholia\u2019s\ntime line in relation to Empedocles\u2019 philosophical system\nremains contested (Osborne 2005).\n",
