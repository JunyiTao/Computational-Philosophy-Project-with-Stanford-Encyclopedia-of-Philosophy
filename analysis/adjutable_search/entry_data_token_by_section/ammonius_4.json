    "main_text": "Philosophical Positions || Ammonius\u2019 Neoplatonism\n3.1 Ammonius\u2019 Neoplatonism\n\nIt was claimed by K. Praechter (1910) that the Alexandrian Neoplatonic\nschool of Ammonius and his followers differed substantially from that\nof Athens both before and after Ammonius\u2019 time, particularly by\ndownplaying the Iamblichean theurgic or magical and religious elements\nand the complex Iamblichean and Proclan hierarchies and triadic\ngroupings at the different levels of reality recognized in\nNeoplatonist metaphysics (on these, see, e.g., Wallis 1972,\n100\u2013110, 123\u201334, 146\u201354). In contrast to these wild\nand woolly Athenian doctrines and practices, Praechter saw the\nAlexandrian school, in whose commentaries such doctrines do not figure\nprominently, as more restrained, rational, respectable; they were\nsober interpreters of Aristotle and had a doctrine much more easily\nreconcilable with the strong Christian cult of Alexandria. Scholars\nlike P. Merlan (1968) went further, making Ammonius the purveyor of a\nstrongly Christianized philosophy which featured a creative, personal\nGod.\n\nRecent studies of the Alexandrians (especially Hadot 1978 on Hierocles\nand Simplicius, Verrycken 1990a on Ammonius, Tempelis 1999, Luna 2001,\nCardullo 2009 and 2012, Hadot 2015, Sorabji 2016a and c) have largely\nresulted in the abandonment of Praechter\u2019s claims. Overlapping\npersonal histories already cast doubt on the hypothesis of a gulf\nbetween the two schools. As noted above, Plutarch\u2019s chosen\nsuccessor Syrianus came from Alexandria together with Hermeias, who\nbrought Plutarch\u2019s and Syrianus\u2019 teachings back from\nAthens to his native city Alexandria. Ammonius studied with and was\nevidently greatly influenced by Proclus in Athens. Furthermore,\nreferences and allusions to various important pieces of Proclan\ndoctrine can be adduced from various places in the commentaries of\nAmmonius and his students. The relative paucity, however, of such\nreferences and their lack of centrality to the works in which they are\nfound makes it difficult to assess their significance in this regard.\nThe interpretation of certain statements which might be interpreted as\ntelling against Ammonius\u2019 espousal of, say, the transcendent\nOne, is also a complex matter. Ammonius\u2019 interpreters now\nrightly rely to a great extent on context in understanding his works.\nThey ask, for example, whenever Ammonius does not mention a particular\nNeoplatonic doctrine or mentions it in a simplified form, whether the\ndoctrine was necessary to an understanding of the passage on which\nAmmonius was commenting. As noted above, Ammonius comments mostly on\nAristotle, especially his logical works. This was the first part of\nthe Neoplatonic curriculum: Marinus (Life of Proclus 13) says\nthat Syrianus taught Proclus all of Aristotle\u2019s works in less\nthan two years and \u201chaving led him through these, as it were,\npreliminary initiatory rites and little mysteries, brought him to the\nmystagogy of Plato\u201d. Ammonius apparently held a similar view of\nthe Aristotelian portion of the Neoplatonic curriculum, and in\ncommentary on such works may have felt no need to go into many of the\ndetails of a complex Neoplatonic theology and metaphysics;, even if he\nheld such views. Even the Metaphysics, which according to\nAmmonius dealt with things \u2018entirely unmoved\u2019, that is,\n\u2018theology\u2019 (Asclepius, in Metaph. 1,3 and\n17\u201318) may not have been thought to require an explanation of\nthe highest levels of reality. In a second statement, explaining the\nfirst line of the book, Asclepius says Aristotle aimed to speak about\n\u201cbeings and how they are beings and, to reason about absolutely\nall beings, insofar as they are beings\u201d (2,9\u201311), which\nHadot (2015, 27) takes to exclude \u201cthe entire divine hierarchy\nbeyond being\u201d. The second statement, however, probably derives\nfrom Alexander, who thinks that the Metaphysics is\ntheological in the sense that God is one of the causes of reality and\nthus a subject of \u2018first philosophy\u2019 (cf. Cardullo 2012,\n225 n. 230). Ammonius here elides the reasoning needed to get from the\nstudy of being qua being to theology, and there is some\nambiguity as to the extent to which he thinks the role of theology in\nAristotle is the same as in Plato (Hadot 2015, 27 n. 83). In some\ncontexts a discussion of certain metaphysical doctrines might even\nhave been inappropriate, especially if the work under discussion was\nmeant to be studied by less advanced students. Thus, the fact that\nAmmonius does not avail himself of certain opportunities to discuss\ncertain tenets of Neoplatonic metaphysics does not mean that he would\nnot espouse such tenets in other circumstances. Still, the very fact\nthat Ammonius was, as emphasized above, especially known for his\ncommentaries on Aristotle, could reflect a tendency on his part not to\nhave taught a full-blown Neoplatonic metaphysical system. Hadot 2015\ngives a lengthy account of the similarities and differences in the\nways Aristotle and Plato were \u2018harmonized\u2019 by various\nPlatonists since Porphyry (cf. the account of various issues on which\nharmonization was needed, as seen in Themistius and then in Ammonius,\nin Sorabji 2016c, 18\u201320 and 53\u201355). In agreement with Cardullo\n(e.g., 2009, 245) that one finds in Ammonius an \u201cabsolute\nallegiance to Neoplatonism\u201d, Hadot interprets differences\nbetween, say, Syrianus-Proclus and Ammonius as resulting from the\ngreater determination of the latter to minimize their possible\ndisagreements and Ammonius\u2019 consequently greater willingness to\nbend Aristotle in Plato\u2019s direction. There may be debate over\nwhether this involved more \u2018Aristotelizing Plato\u2019 or\n\u2018Platonizing Aristotle\u2019 (cf. Sorabji 2016a,\nxxvii\u2013xxxi for a discussion of Hadot\u2019s objections to\nVerrycken\u2019s [1990] view of Ammonius\u2019 simplification of the\nmetaphysics of the Athenian Neoplatonists). One may also wonder\nwhether Ammonius would have thought that his philosophy differed in\nany important way from that of his Athenian teacher. \n\nOn the most general level, Ammonius says that the purpose and utility\nof studying Aristotle\u2019s philosophy is \u201cto ascend to the\ncommon principle (arkh\u0113) of all things and to be aware\nthat this is the one goodness itself, incorporeal, indivisible,\nuncircumscribed, unbounded and of infinite potentiality\u201d (in\nCat. 6,9\u201312). Thus, his stance, in this early work, is that\nof a Neoplatonist, as has been clearly shown by Verrycken (1990a,\n212\u201315). Thus he says that Aristotle\u2019s distinction of\nspoken sound, affection of the soul, and thing in the world (De\nInt. 16a3\u20138) corresponds to the Neoplatonic hypostases of\nSoul, Intellect and God (in Int. 24,24\u20139). He also\nplaces \u2018not-being\u2019 above the Intellect at the highest\nplane of reality and occasionally writes in a manner reminiscent of\nProclus\u2019 divine henads. So there seems no doubt of his genuine\ncommitment to a Neoplatonic stance in metaphysics, even if, as\nVerrycken would hold, he may not have espoused a system as complex as\nthat of Proclus.\n\nPerhaps, though, Ammonius set different emphases and cited different\nultimate authorities than the Athenians. Following Iamblichus,\nSyrianus and Proclus held that Plato taught the true philosophy that\noriginated with Pythagoras and various of his followers, including\nParmenides. They also thought the highest expression of this ancient\nwisdom was found in the Orphic Hymns and in the Chaldaean Oracles, and\nthese two works were the final course Syrianus was willing to teach,\nbut only to Proclus and Domninus, though disagreement over which one\nto study caused the two students to be taught separately, and\nProclus\u2019 study of the Oracles was interrupted by\nSyrianus\u2019 death (Marinus, Life of Proclus 26). Proclus\nlater worked intensively on both texts, along with those of Porphyry\nand Iamblichus, and taught them. In fact, \u201che attained the\nhighest degree of theurgic virtue\u201d (Life of Proclus\n27\u201328). Ammonius was certainly concerned, in Asclepius\u2019\ncommentary on Metaphysics A, to point out on numerous\noccasions that Aristotle\u2014who criticized the Pythagoreans and,\naccording to Ammonius, also the line of reasoning that led from them\nto Plato\u2014had got them wrong, since he did not understand that\nthey expressed themselves \u2018symbolically\u2019 (cf. Cardullo\n2009, 258\u2013259). Again, some argue that Ammonius and his students\ndid not see the importance of the \u2018divine poetry\u2019 of\nOrpheus and the Chaldaean Oracles. Hadot 2015, 13\u201314 counters\nthat citation of these poetic works is also infrequent in Aristotelian\ncommentaries of the Athenian school, while both Olympiodorus and\nDamascius cite the Oracles in their commentaries on Plato\u2019s\nPhaedo. In any event, it is important to note that we have no\nrecord that Ammonius or his pupils lectured or commented on the four\ngreat \u2018theological\u2019 dialogues in the Neoplatonic\ncurriculum: Phaedrus, Symposium, Philebus, Parmenides (cf.\nTarrant, in Jackson, et al. 1998, 3). \n",
