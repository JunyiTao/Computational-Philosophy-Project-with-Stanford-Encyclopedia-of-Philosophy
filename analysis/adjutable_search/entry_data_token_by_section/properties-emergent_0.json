    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nAlthough debates concerning the reality or precise nature of emergence\nare largely driven by contemporary scientific theorizing, the basic\nnotion has quite a long history stretching back at least to Aristotle\n(384\u2013322 BC). On Aristotle\u2019s view, human beings, like\nother \u201csecondary\u201d substances, arise from a distinctive\narrangement of the four material elements. While the mental powers of\nhuman beings require and are necessitated by such an arrangement,\nthese powers are distinct from, and downwardly causally efficacious\nwith respect to, any non-mental powers. Furthermore, Aristotle\u2019s\nform/matter compound conception of material substances is consonant\nwith the standard emergentist stance between substance dualism and\nreductionism. For detailed discussion, see Caston (1997). Among\nPeripatetic philosophers, Alexander of Aphrodisias (late\n2nd\u2013early 3rd century AD; in On the Soul) and Galen\n(129\u2013c.200; in On the Elements According to Hippocrates\nand elsewhere) develop distinctive versions of Aristotle\u2019s basic\nemergentist picture to apply to chemical compounds and other\nnon-living phenomena as well as living beings. (For discussion of\nseveral texts, see again Caston 1997: 347\u2013353.)\n\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy of nature is re-appropriated in the\nmedieval era, first by Persian and Arabic philosophers such as\nAvicenna/Ibn Sina (980\u20131037) and then, with the translation of\nmany of Aristotle\u2019s key texts into Latin, by philosophers in the\nWest, including Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274). In the Latin West,\nAristotelian ideas, once introduced, become pervasive throughout the\nera. In particular, Aristotle\u2019s matter/form conception of\nsubstance and his concomitant rejection of atomism become axiomatic\npoints of departure in theorizing about the nature of particular kinds\nof bodies and the distinctive kinds of processes associated with them.\n(On Aquinas, see Pasnau 2001 and Stump 2003, Part II; Pasnau 2011\nexamines in detail a wide range of views of substance in the\npost-Aquinas scholastic period.)\n\nThe consensus around the Aristotelian philosophy of nature was\ndismantled by the Scientific Revolution, with Aristotle\u2019s\nphysics being the first casualty. Ren\u00e9 Descartes advances an\nausterely mechanistic and reductionist conception of material bodies,\nand this broad outlook becomes widespread. However, Descartes argues\nthat the human mind or soul is a non-material substance, and so\nendorses a substantial form of mind-body dualism. For those also\naccepting the reductionist conception of the physical world, the\nalternatives to Descartes\u2019 substance dualism are stark: idealism\n(on which matter is a mere \u201cphenomenon\u201d to be analyzed in\nterms of sensations, as advocated by George Berkeley) or reductionist\nmaterialism, as exemplified by Julien de la Mettrie\u2019s\nL\u2019homme Machine (Man the Machine, 1747).\n\nThis menu of options is rejected in the nineteenth century by the\nso-called British Emergentists (with Lewes [1875] first using the term\n\u201cemergence\u201d for the philosophical position). In \u201cOn\nthe Composition of Causes\u201d (A System of Logic, 1843:\nCh. 6),\n John Stuart Mill (see entry)\n argues that the behavior of living beings involves a failure of\naggregativity or linearity of influence among their elements. He\nproposes an account that distinguishes \u201chomopathic\u201d and\n\u201cheteropathic\u201d laws and effects involving organized\nphenomena, maintaining that the latter laws (governing emergent\nphenomena) supplement without supplanting basic physical laws of more\ngeneral scope. \n\nSamuel Alexander (see entry)\n suggested that life was a \u201cnew quality\u201d that emerges from\nphysico-chemical processes and brings with it \u201cspecial laws of\nbehavior\u201d and which must \u201cbe accepted with the\n\u2018natural piety\u2019 of the investigator. It admits no\nexplanation\u201d (1920: vol.2, 46\u201347). Even so, he insists\nthat he is endorsing \u201ca species of the identity doctrine\u201d\n(1920: 9), which suggests that he is seeking to articulate a more\nintimate relationship between levels of the natural world, perhaps\nvery much akin to weak emergence accounts discussed in\n section 3\n below.\n\nFinally, British Emergentism reaches its most developed form in\n C. D. Broad\u2019s (see entry)\nThe Mind and Its Place in Nature (1925). Broad uses an\nepistemological criterion for what he intends to be a metaphysical\ncondition of emergent autonomy: \n\n\nthe characteristic properties of the whole R(A, B, C) [where R marks\ntheir structural arrangement] cannot, even in theory, be deduced from\nthe most complete knowledge of the properties of A, B, and C in\nisolation or in other wholes which are not of the form R(A, B, C).\n(1925: 61) \n\n\nHe adds that emergent features are \u201ccompletely determined\u201d\nby such lower-level features, in that \n\n\nwhenever you have a whole composed of these [\u2026] elements in\ncertain proportions and relations you have something with the\n[compound\u2019s] characteristic properties and [\u2026] nothing\nhas these properties except a whole composed in this way. (1925: 64)\n\n\n\nReminiscent of Mill, he distinguishes \u201cintra-ordinal\u201d from\nemergent \u201ctrans-ordinal\u201d laws (1925: 77\u20138) which,\nalthough dealing solely with complex phenomena, are \u201cunique and\nultimate\u201d (1925: 64\u20135). As a consequence:\n\n\nOn the emergent theory we have to reconcile ourselves to much less\nunity in the external world and a much less intimate connexion between\nthe various sciences. At best the external world and the various\nsciences that deal with it will form a kind of hierarchy. (1925:\n78)\n\n\nThe popularity of the emergentist vision waned beginning shortly after\nBroad\u2019s writing, with important scientific developments eroding\nthe boundaries between adjacent \u201clevels\u201d (most notably\nquantum chemistry and molecular biochemistry\u2014see McLaughlin 1992\nfor discussion). However, attention to emergence was substantially\nreinvigorated starting in the 1970s with the discovery and creation of\nnon-linear complex systems of both natural and artifactual varieties.\nThere is now a large recent literature developing accounts of\nemergence motivated by such systems. It has gradually broadened to\nencompass mental phenomena that seem to resist physicalist treatment\n(e.g., consciousness and free will) and some have even begun to\nre-think received wisdom concerning the relationship of chemistry and\nbiology to lower-level sciences. These debates are of considerable\nimportance for our understanding of the natural world and of our own\nplace within it. As the bibliography attests, the questions at issue\nhere engage philosophers and scientists alike. This should be\nunsurprisingly, for these questions are neither simply empirical nor\nwholly a priori in character, but are rather such that\nplausible (if not uncontroversial) answers require consideration of\nand support for metaphysical interpretations of the structure of\nnatural reality in light of our best empirical theories.\n\nAffirming that there are emergent phenomena that are both\ndependent on and yet autonomous with respect to underlying physical\nstructures leaves a great deal open, however, as both of the\ncharacteristics have been explicated in diverse ways (see Van Gulick\n2001, Gillett 2002, Wilson 2015, and Humphreys 2016 for discussions\nhighlighting this diversity). Accounts of the dependence at issue may\nappeal to relations of composition, supervenience, realization,\ngrounding, or causation. Accounts of the autonomy at issue may appeal\nto fundamental or non-fundamental novelty of powers, properties,\nforces, laws, or effects; irreducibility; non-aggregativity; or\nnon-linearity.\n\nThough diverse, accounts of ontological emergence can be usefully\ngrouped by a basic division between those that are and are not\ncompatible with physicalism, understood as the thesis that\nall natural phenomena are wholly constituted and completely\nmetaphysically determined by fundamental physical phenomena. This\nthesis is standardly understood to entail \u201cthe causal closure of\nthe physical\u201d, according to which (roughly) any\nfundamental-level physical effect has a purely fundamental physical\ncause. \u201cStrong\u201d emergence accounts are inconsistent with\nphysicalism and causal closure (as just elucidated) while weak\nemergence accounts are consistent with it.\n\nThe general division into weak and strong varieties of ontological\nemergence frames much of the discussion to follow:\n\nSection 2 (\u201cOntological emergence: features\u201d) surveys\nthe main options for understanding the primary characteristics of\ndependence and autonomy, noting whether they are more commonly\nassociated with weak emergence, strong emergence, or both.\nSection 3 (\u201cWeak emergence\u201d) explains the primary\nmotivations for and challenges to weak emergence as a general approach\nand presents a range of possible accounts.\nSection 4 (\u201cStrong emergence\u201d) explains the primary\nmotivations for and challenges to strong emergence as a general\napproach and presents a range of possible accounts.\nSection 5 (\u201cWeak vs strong emergence: contested\nphenomena\u201d) canvasses phenomena recently proposed as potential\ncases of (the more controversial) strong emergence and briefly notes\narguments for and against their having that status.\n\n",
