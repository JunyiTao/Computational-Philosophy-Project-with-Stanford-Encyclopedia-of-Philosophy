Big Data Between Causation and Prediction\n\nAnother epistemological debate strongly linked to reflection on big\ndata concerns the specific kinds of knowledge emerging from\ndata-centric forms of inquiry, and particularly the relation between\npredictive and causal knowledge. \n\nBig data science is widely seen as revolutionary in the scale and\npower of predictions that it can support. Unsurprisingly perhaps, a\nphilosophically sophisticated defence of this position comes from the\nphilosophy of mathematics, where Marco Panza, Domenico Napoletani and\nDaniele Struppa argued for big data science as occasioning a momentous\nshift in the predictive knowledge that mathematical analysis can\nyield, and thus its role within broader processes of knowledge\nproduction. The whole point of big data analysis, they posit, is its\ndisregard for causal knowledge: \n\n\nanswers are found through a process of automatic fitting of the data\nto models that do not carry any structural understanding beyond the\nactual solution of the problem itself. (Napoletani, Panza, &\nStruppa 2014: 486) \n\n\nThis view differs from simplistic popular discourse on \u201cthe\ndeath of theory\u201d (Anderson 2008) and the \u201cpower of\ncorrelations\u201d (Mayer-Schoenberg and Cukier 2013) insofar as it\ndoes not side-step the constraints associated with knowledge and\ngeneralisations that can be extracted from big data analysis.\nNapoletani, Panza and Struppa recognise that there are inescapable\ntensions around the ability of mathematical reasoning to overdetermine\nempirical input, to the point of providing a justification for any and\nevery possible interpretation of the data. In their words, \n\n\nthe problem arises of how we can gain meaningful understanding of\nhistorical phenomena, given the tremendous potential variability of\ntheir developmental processes. (Napoletani et al. 2014: 487) \n\n\nTheir solution is to clarify that understanding phenomena is not the\ngoal of predictive reasoning, which is rather a form of agnostic\nscience: \u201cthe possibility of forecasting and analysing\nwithout a structured and general understanding\u201d (Napoletani et al.\n2011: 12). The\nopacity of algorithmic rationality thus becomes its key virtue and the\nreason for the extraordinary epistemic success of forecasting grounded\non big data. While \u201cthe phenomenon may forever re-main hidden to\nour understanding\u201d(ibid.: 5), the application of mathematical models and algorithms\nto big data can still provide meaningful and reliable answers to\nwell-specified problems\u2014similarly to what has been argued in the\ncase of false models (Wimsatt 2007). Examples include the use of\n\u201cforcing\u201d methods such as regularisation or diffusion\ngeometry to facilitate the extraction of useful insights from messy\ndatasets. \n\nThis view is at odds with accounts that posit scientific understanding\nas a key aim of science (de Regt 2017), and the intuition that what\nresearchers are ultimately interested in is \n\n\nwhether the opaque data-model generated by machine-learning\ntechnologies count as explanations for the relationships found between\ninput and output. (Boon 2020: 44) \n\n\nWithin the philosophy of biology, for example, it is well recognised\nthat big data facilitates effective extraction of patterns and trends,\nand that being able to model and predict how an organism or ecosystem\nmay behave in the future is of great importance, particularly within\nmore applied fields such as biomedicine or conservation science. At\nthe same time, researchers are interested in understanding the reasons\nfor observed correlations, and typically use predictive patterns as\nheuristics to explore, develop and verify causal claims about the\nstructure and functioning of entities and processes. Emanuele Ratti\n(2015) has argued that big data mining within genome-wide association\nstudies often used in cancer genomics can actually underpin\nmechanistic reasoning, for instance by supporting eliminative\ninference to develop mechanistic hypotheses and by helping to explore\nand evaluate generalisations used to analyse the data. In a similar\nvein, Pietsch (2016)\nproposed to use variational induction as a method to establish what\ncounts as causal relationships among big data patterns, by focusing on\nwhich analytic strategies allow for reliable prediction and effective\nmanipulation of a phenomenon.\n\nThrough the study of data sourcing and processing in epidemiology,\nStefano Canali has instead highlighted the difficulties of deriving\nmechanistic claims from big data analysis, particularly where data are\nvaried and embodying incompatible perspectives and methodological\napproaches (Canali 2016, 2019). Relatedly, the semantic and logistical\nchallenges of organising big data give reason to doubt the reliability\nof causal claims extracted from such data. In terms of logistics,\nhaving a lot of data is not the same as having all of them, and\ncultivating illusions of comprehensiveness is a risky and potentially\nmisleading strategy, particularly given the challenges encountered in\ndeveloping and applying curatorial standards for data other than the\nhigh-throughput results of \u201comics\u201d approaches (see also\nthe next section). The constant worry about the partiality and\nreliability of data is reflected in the care put by database curators\nin enabling database users to assess such properties; and in the\nimportance given by researchers themselves, particularly in the\nbiological and environmental sciences, to evaluating the quality of\ndata found on the internet (Leonelli 2014, Fleming et al. 2017). In\nterms of semantics, we are back to the role of data classifications as\ntheoretical scaffolding for big data analysis that we discussed in the\nprevious section. Taxonomic efforts to order and visualise data inform\ncausal reasoning extracted from such data (Sterner\n& Franz 2017), and can themselves constitute a bottom-up\nmethod\u2014grounded in comparative reasoning\u2014for assigning\nmeaning to data models, particularly in situation where a full-blown\ntheory or explanation for the phenomenon under investigation is not\navailable (Sterner 2014).\n\nIt is no coincidence that much philosophical work on the relation\nbetween causal and predictive knowledge extracted from big data comes\nfrom the philosophy of the life sciences, where the absence of\naxiomatized theories has elicited sophisticated views on the diversity\nof forms and functions of theory within inferential reasoning.\nMoreover, biological data are heterogeneous both in their content and\nin their format; are curated and re-purposed to address the needs of\nhighly disparate and fragmented epistemic communities; and present\ncurators with specific challenges to do with tracking complex, diverse\nand evolving organismal structures and behaviours, whose relation to\nan ever-changing environment is hard to pinpoint with any stability\n(e.g., Shavit & Griesemer 2009). Hence in this domain, some of the\ncore methods and epistemic concerns of experimental\nresearch\u2014including exploratory experimentation, sampling and the\nsearch for causal mechanisms\u2014remain crucial parts of\ndata-centric inquiry.\n",
