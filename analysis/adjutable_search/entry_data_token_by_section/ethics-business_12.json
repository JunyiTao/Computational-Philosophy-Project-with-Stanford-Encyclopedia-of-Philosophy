Below we consider four issues at the\nemployer/employee interface: (1) hiring and firing, (2) pay, (3)\nmeaningful work, and (4) whistleblowing. Another important topic at\nthis interface is privacy. For space reasons it will not be discussed,\nbut see the entries on\n privacy\n and\n privacy and information technology.\n",
