    "main_text": "Background\n1. Background\n\n\nMoritz Schlick is primarily remembered as the leader of the Vienna\nCircle of Logical Positivists, which flourished in the early\n1930s. Few philosophers of science today would deny that\ntheir views have been influenced \u2013 one way or the other \u2013 by the\npositions which emerged from the group of philosophers, mathematicians,\nand social scientists who gathered in between-wars Vienna. And\nwhile it cannot be denied that other Circle members were more prominent\nand influential over the long-term, none contributed more unity and\ncohesion to the Vienna group during its brief existence. Indeed,\nlong before 1930, when the Circle\u2019s Manifesto,\n\u201cWissenschaftliche Weltauffassung: Der Wiener\nKreis\u201d, appeared, Schlick had already made contributions to\nscientific epistemology which exerted a profound influence on\nsubsequent generations of philosophers (Neurath 1973, Ch. 9). And while\nother Circle members quite deservedly continue to receive a great deal\nof attention, there has always been a steady interest in\nSchlick\u2019s views on a range of issues, for there is much of\nlasting value to be discovered in them. \n\n\nSchlick was born in Berlin in 1882 and grew up as the son of a\nmiddle-class factory manager. After gymnasium, he\nattended the University of Berlin, intent from the start to study\nphysics. His ambition led him to work with Max Planck and he\nreceived his Ph.D. in 1904. After a year of experimental work at\nG\u00f6ttingen, he eventually made his way to Zurich where he took up\nthe study of Philosophy. In 1910, he secured a position at\nRostock, moving on to Kiel before assuming the Chair of\nNaturphilosophie at Vienna in 1922. Through all these\nchanges, as well as subsequent modifications of his thought, the\nevidence of Schlick\u2019s training in Berlin remained just below the\nsurface. Schlick was, after all, the heir apparent to the\ntradition of philosophical physicists, a tradition founded by Hermann\nvon Helmholtz, the icon of 19th Century physics and an influential\nleader of the zur\u00fcck zu Kant movement, and continued by\nhis student and (later) colleague Planck (Coffa 1991, 179\u2013183). \nAlthough few professional philosophers embraced the methods and\nproblems of the philosophical physicists, they were highly influential\nthroughout the community of professional physicists, largely due to\ntheir prestige.\n",
