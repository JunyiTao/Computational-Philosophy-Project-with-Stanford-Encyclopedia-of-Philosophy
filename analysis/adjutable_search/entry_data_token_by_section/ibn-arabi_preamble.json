    "main_text": "\n\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee (1165\u20131240) can be considered the\ngreatest of all Muslim philosophers, provided we understand philosophy\nin the broad, modern sense and not simply as the discipline of\nfalsafa, whose outstanding representatives are Avicenna and,\nmany would say, Mull\u00e2 Sadr\u00e2. Salman Bashier (2012) has\neven argued that \u201cthe story of Islamic philosophy\u201d depicts\nan initial rationalistic phase and culminates with an\n\u201cilluminative phase\u201d best represented by Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee. Most Western scholarship and much of the later\nIslamic tradition have classified Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee as a\n\u201cSufi\u201d, though he himself did not; his works cover the\nwhole gamut of Islamic sciences, not least Koran commentary, Hadith\n(sayings of Muhammad), jurisprudence, principles of jurisprudence,\ntheology, philosophy, and mysticism. Unlike al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee,\nwhose range of work is similar to his, he did not usually write in\nspecific genres, but tended rather to integrate and synthesize the\nsciences in the context of thematic works, ranging in length from one\nor two folios to several thousand pages. Nor did he depart from the\nhighest level of discourse, or repeat himself in different works. The\nlater Sufi tradition called him al-Shaykh al-Akbar, the\nGreatest Master, a title that was understood to mean that no one else\nhas been or will be able to unpack the multi-layered significance of\nthe sources of the Islamic tradition with such detail and\nprofundity.\n\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s writings remained unknown in the West\nuntil modern times, but they spread throughout the Islamic world\nwithin a century of his death. The early Orientalists, with one or two\nexceptions, paid little attention to him because he had no discernable\ninfluence in Europe. His works, moreover, are notoriously difficult,\nmaking it easy to dismiss him as a \u201cmystic\u201d or a\n\u201cpantheist\u201d without trying to read him. Not until books by\nHenry Corbin (1958) and Toshihiko Izutsu (1966) was he recognized as\nan extraordinarily broad-ranging and highly original thinker with much\nto contribute to the world of philosophy. These two scholars, however,\nlimited their attention almost entirely to one of his short works,\nFus\u00fbs al-hikam (\u201cThe Ringstones of the\nWisdoms\u201d). Although Ringstones was the focus of a long\ntradition of commentary, it represents but a tiny fraction of what he\noffers in his massive al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t al-makkiyya\n(\u201cThe Meccan Openings\u201d). More recently, scholars have\nbegun to look at this work (which will fill an estimated 15,000 pages\nin its modern edition), but relatively little of it has been\ntranslated into Western languages and what has been translated is\nstill in need of further explanation, interpretation, and\ncontextualization in the history of philosophy (for a stab at the\nlast, see Ebstein 2013).\n\nSeveral scholars have pointed to parallels between Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee and figures like Eckhart and Cusanus (Sells 1994,\nShah-Kazemi 2006, Smirnov 1993, Dobie 2009), and others have suggested\nthat he anticipates trends in physics (Yousef 2007) or modern\nphilosophy (Almond 2004, Coates 2002, Dobie 2007). The most serious\nattempt to fit him into the history of Western philosophy argues that\nhis notion of barzakh (see section 3.4) offers a viable\nsolution to the problem of defining the indefinable, which has dogged\nepistemology from the time of Aristotle and led to the despair of\nmodern philosophers like Rorty (Bashier 2004). Other scholars have\ncompared him to Eastern thinkers like Shankara, Zhuangzi, and\nD\u00f4gen (Shah-Kazemi 2006, Izutsu 1966, Izutsu 1977). Nor were the\nsimilarities to Eastern thought lost on premodern scholars; during the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Muslims of China established\na Chinese-language school (the Han Kitab) that drew from Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s legacy and presented the Islamic worldview\nin terms drawn from Confucian thought (Murata et al. 2008).\nImplications of his thought for contemporary concerns have been\naddressed by a diverse array of scholars and devotees in the\nJournal of the Muhyiddin Ibn \u2018Arabi Society, which has\nbeen published since 1983. All the attention he has been receiving,\nand specifically from scholars and thinkers labelled\n\u201cperennialists,\u201d has led some to question the validity of\nthe modern lenses through which he is often read (Lipton 2018). What\nfollows is an outline of some of the topics he addresses.\n",
