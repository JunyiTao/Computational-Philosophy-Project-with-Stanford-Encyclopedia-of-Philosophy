    "main_text": "Developments in England || The Cambridge Platonists\n4.2 The Cambridge Platonists\n\nThe shifting use of conscientia has here been traced through\nthe Cartesian line. However, a largely independent line developed\nthrough the Cambridge Platonists (as is argued in Thiel 1991), and in\nparticular in the writings of Ralph Cudworth. \n\nCudworth developed his theory by reflecting on Plotinus\u2019s\nEnneads, where Plotinus makes use of the Greek term\nsynaisthesis (literally: \u201csensed with\u201d) to\ndistinguish lower natures from higher. Cudworth translates this into\nEnglish as \u201ccon-sense\u201d or\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d (True Intellectual\nSystem 159). It is by working out a particularly Platonic\nmetaphysical theory that Cudworth develops his account of\nconsciousness.\n\nCudworth, along with other Cambridge Platonists, argued for\n\u201cplastic natures,\u201d which are immaterial sources of action\nin the world. These plastic natures are similar to minds or souls,\nbut, pace Descartes, Cudworth allowed that there are\nnon-conscious thoughts and non-conscious plastic natures. Against\nDescartes\u2019s argument that all mental states are conscious,\nCudworth argues as follows (True Intellectual System\n160):\n\nSuppose, for reductio, that \u201ccogitation\u201d (or\nthought) is the essence of the soul.\nThe essence of thought is consciousness (granted by both Cudworth\nand Descartes).\nThe souls of men are sometimes in a deep, dreamless sleep (i.e.,\nwithout consciousness).\nSo, by (1) through (3), the souls of men sometimes cease to\nexist.\nBut (4) is absurd.\nAnd so, (1) should be rejected: the essence of the soul is not\nthought. \n\n\nAnd so there is much in the soul (and especially in other principles\nof life) that we know nothing about and cannot account for\nmechanically (ibid). Unlike Spinoza and Leibniz (below),\nCudworth does not have the same interest in articulating a\n\u201cnatural\u201d account of consciousness or mental activity,\nsince the plastic natures themselves are sources of divine\nactivity and providence.\n\nNevertheless, the role consciousness plays in Cudworth\u2019s system\nis a similar awareness of one\u2019s own thought that is distinct\nfrom the moral conscience. While consciousness does contain a\nreference to the subject of thought, for Cudworth, it does not do so\nimmediately or explicitly. It takes a distinct act of reflection in\norder to provide the sort of self-reference necessary for making moral\njudgments about one\u2019s own actions (Thiel 1991 92\u201324). (For\nmore on Cudworth\u2019s account of consciousness, see Thiel 1991 and\nL\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki 2010.)\n",
