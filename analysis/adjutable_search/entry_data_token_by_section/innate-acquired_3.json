    "main_text": "Outline of scientific debates over nativism || Critiques of instinct psychology in the 1920s\n1.3 Critiques of instinct psychology in the 1920s\n\nOne of the first frontal attacks on the concept of instinct was that\nof social psychologist Knight Dunlap (1919). He contrasted two general\napproaches to the study of instinct. The \u201cphysiological\u201d\napproach identified each instinct with a distinct neuro-physiological\nmechanism. Dunlap was in principle supportive of this approach,\nclaiming that it could potentially generate useful definitions of\nparticular instincts. However, Dunlap lamented that, \u201cI am very\nstrongly convinced that it is not at present possible to secure\nagreement to confine the term to this meaning\u201d (1919, 308). The\nproblem, he thought, stemmed from the prevalence of\n\u201cteleological\u201d approaches to instinct, of which McDougall\nwas a prime example. On the teleological approach, components of\nbehavior are grouped together as members of a class according to their\ntendency to generate some functional outcome. Dunlap cited the\n\u201cmoral instinct\u201d and \u201cthe instinct for\npugnacity\u201d as examples. Dunlap was willing to tolerate this\napproach provided that \u201c[t]he grouping of activities into\n\u2018instincts\u2019 [is] \u2026 clearly understood to be a\ndevice of convenience only, similar to the arrangement of documents in\na well ordered filing system\u201d (1919, 309). Problems emerge, he\nthought, when psychologists reified those groupings, regarding them as\nnatural (as opposed to instrumental) categories. Dunlap argued that\nthis tendency encouraged psychologists to draw faulty inferences. For\nexample, \u201cHaving posited a \u2018pugnacious instinct,\u2019\n\u2026 one writer proceeds gravely to infer that war is forever a\nnecessity, as the expression of this instinct.\u201d (Dunlap 1919,\n309). From identifying pugnacity as a natural teleological category,\npsychologists inferred that it is developmentally fixed. Dunlap\nrecognized that this inference was empirically unwarranted.\n\nSocial psychologist Luther Lee Bernard (1921; 1924) also thought that\nambiguity in psychologists\u2019 use of \u201cinstinct\u201d\npromoted faulty inferences. As he explained, the typical instinct\ntheorist, \u201coften confuses both himself and the reader by such\nvagueness of speaking, for he may at one time mean only to emphasize\nthe automatic character of the act and at another he may fall back\nupon the recognized or approved meaning of the term, implying that\nautomatism is an inherited phenomenon\u201d (1921, 101). In other\nplaces, Bernard observed, instinct theorists would take developmental\nfixity as a sufficient condition for instinct, with \u201cany\nrelatively fixed or definite action pattern being pronounced an\ninstinct whether it is acquired or inherited\u201d (1921, 101). In\naddition to such inconsistencies, Bernard accused instinct theorists\nof remaining \u201cuntouched by the biological foundations of these\nsciences\u2026 [since] they have failed to grasp the true\nsignificance of Mendelian theory for the social and mental\nsciences\u201d (1921, 103). To illustrate, Bernard cited examples in\nwhich instinct theorists would posit the evolution of a\nspecies-typical instinct in just a few generations. Such rapid\nfixation violated basic principles of Mendelian inheritance as Bernard\nunderstood them. Bernard envisioned a future for social psychology\n\u201cthe practitioners of which fully recognized that nature and\nculture could not be separated\u201d (Cravens and Burnham 1971,\n654\u201355).\n\nPerhaps the fiercest critic of the concept of instinct was the\nBerkeley-educated Chinese psychologist Zing-Yang Kuo (Gu\u014d\nR\u00e8nyu\u01cen) who was dedicated to a Watsonian vision of\npsychology as an experimental science grounded on behaviorist\nprinciples (Honeycutt 2011). Kuo pejoratively referred to instinct\ntheory as \u201cfinished psychology\u201d because it discouraged\nresearchers from exploring the potential influences of learning early\nin an organism\u2019s life. As he explained, \u201c[t]he\npreconception of instinct has often betrayed the psychologist into\noverlooking the new environmental factors which are chiefly\nresponsible for the supposedly unlearned acts\u201d (Kuo 1921, 653).\nIn his earlier writings, Kuo (1921) admitted that certain\n\u201chereditary action units\u201d appear early in development and\ncould be classified as instincts, provided that they are viewed merely\nas developmental resources and not as functional behaviors (Honeycutt\n2011). However, this admission inspired critics, such as Geiger\n(1922), to object that Kuo was implicitly relying on the very concept\nof instinct which he purported to reject. This prompted Kuo (1924;\n1929) to revise his position, ultimately questioning the very\ndistinction between heredity vs acquired traits (Honeycutt 2011). His\nmain argument assumed that in order to identify some behavior as\nhereditary (as opposed to acquired), it would be necessary to identify\nthree things: (1) some fixed behavioral pattern, (2) the\nneuro-physiological mechanisms generating that pattern, and (3) a link\nto specific germ cells responsible for producing that mechanism. Kuo\nmaintained that there simply were no fixed behaviors, let alone ones\nthat could be associated with definite neuromuscular patterns\n(Honeycutt 2011). At the same time, available embryological evidence\n(e.g. Carmichael 1925) revealed that germ cells do not act\nindependently of environmental influences during development. Thus,\nKuo concluded that the very idea of a hereditary trait is,\n\u2018\u2018beyond any experimental approach, and will always remain\nas an unverifiable abstraction which serves no scientific purpose\nwhatever\u2019\u2019 (Kuo 1929, 195). A true scientist, Kuo argued,\nwould not be satisfied with labelling behavior\n\u2018instinctive\u2019 but would demand a causal analysis of its\norigin in the embryo, asking \u2018How are our Instincts\nAcquired?\u2019 (Kuo 1922, 344)\n\nFew psychologists went as far as Kuo in rejecting the concept of\nheredity in psychology (e.g. Tolman 1922). However, the criticisms of\nDunlap, Bernard, Kuo and others led to a rejection of instinct as a\nlegitimate topic of investigation, at least in North America. This\noccurred in conjunction with the rise of behaviorism and its focus on\nlearning theory as a framework for explaining animal and human\nbehavior.\n",
