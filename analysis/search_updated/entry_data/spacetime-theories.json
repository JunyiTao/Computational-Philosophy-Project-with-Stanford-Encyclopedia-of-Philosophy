    "main_text": "\n1. Mach\n\nBetween the time of Newton and Leibniz and the 20th century,\nNewton\u2019s mechanics and gravitation theory reigned essentially\nunchallenged, and with that long period of dominance, Newton\u2019s\nabsolute space came to be widely accepted. At least, no natural\nphilosopher or physicist offered a serious challenge to Newton\u2019s\nabsolute space, in the sense of offering a rival theory that dispenses\nwith it. But like the action at a distance in Newtonian gravity,\nabsolute space continued to provoke philosophical unease. Seeking a\nreplacement for the unobservable Newtonian space, Neumann (1870) and\nLange (1885) developed more concrete definitions of the reference\nframes in which Newton\u2019s laws\n hold.[1]\n In these and a few other works, the concept of the set of\ninertial frames (those in which material bodies obey\nNewton\u2019s three laws of motion) was first clearly expressed,\nthough it was implicit in both remarks and procedures found in\nNewton\u2019s Principia. (See the entries on\n space and time: inertial frames\n and\n Newton\u2019s views on space, time, and motion)\n The most sustained, comprehensive, and influential attack on absolute\nspace was made by Ernst Mach in his Science of Mechanics\n(1883).\n\nIn a lengthy discussion of Newton\u2019s Scholium on\nabsolute space, Mach accuses Newton of violating his own\nmethodological precepts by going well beyond what the observational\nfacts teach us concerning motion and acceleration. Mach at least\npartly misinterpreted Newton\u2019s aims in the Scholium,\nand inaugurated a reading of Newton\u2019s bucket argument (and by\nextension the globes argument) that has largely persisted in the\nliterature since. (See\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n section 4, for discussion of Newton\u2019s bucket argument.) Mach\nviewed the argument as directed against a \u2018strict\u2019 or\n\u2018general-relativity\u2019 form of relationism, and as an\nattempt to establish the existence of absolute space. (Strict\nrelationism denies that there is any such thing as an absolute motion;\nall motion is merely relative, i.e., is nothing more than changes of\nlocation relative to some arbitrarily chosen reference frame.) Mach\npoints out the obvious gap in the argument when so construed: the\nexperiment only establishes that acceleration (rotation) of the water\nwith respect to the Earth, or the frame of the fixed stars,\nproduces the tendency to recede from the center; it does not prove\nthat a strict relationist theory cannot account for the bucket\nphenomena, much less the existence of absolute space.\n\nThe reader of the entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories\n will recall that Newton\u2019s actual aim was simply to show that\nDescartes\u2019 two kinds of motion are not adequate to account for\nrotational phenomena. Newton\u2019s bucket argument showed that the\neffects of rotational motion could not be accounted for by means of\nthe motion of the water relative to its immediate surroundings (the\nbucket walls); Newton\u2019s thought experiment with two globes\nconnected by a cord was meant to show that one can determine whether\nthey are rotating about their common center (and if so, in which\ndirection) without needing any reference to anything external. By\npushing on opposite faces of the two globes and checking for an\nincrease or decrease in the tension in the cord, one can determine in\nwhich sense the spheres are in rotation, if they are rotating at\nall.\n\nAlthough Mach does not mention the globes thought experiment\nspecifically, it is easy to read an implicit response to it in the\nthings he does say: nobody is competent to say what would happen, or\nwhat would be possible, in a universe devoid of matter other than two\nglobes. In other words, Mach would question Newton\u2019s starting\npremise that the cord connecting the two globes in an otherwise empty\nuniverse might be under tension, and indeed under a wide range of\ndifferent quantities of tension. So, for Mach, neither the bucket nor\nthe globes can establish the existence of absolute space.\n1.1 Two Interpretations of Mach on Inertia\n\nBoth in Mach\u2019s interpretations of Newton\u2019s arguments and\nin his replies, one can already see two anti-absolute space viewpoints\nemerge, though Mach himself never fully kept them apart. The first\nstrain, which we may call \u2018Mach-lite\u2019, criticizes\nNewton\u2019s postulation of absolute space as a metaphysical leap\nthat is neither justified by actual experiments, nor methodologically\nsound. The remedy offered by Mach-lite is simple: we should retain\nNewton\u2019s mechanics and use it just as we already do, but\neliminate the unnecessary posit of absolute space. In its place we\nneed only substitute the reference frame of the fixed stars, as is the\npractice in astronomy in any case. If we find the incorporation of a\nreference to contingent circumstances (the existence of a single\nreference frame in which the stars are more or less stationary) in the\nfundamental laws of nature problematic (which Mach need not, given his\nofficial positivist account of scientific laws), then Mach suggests\nthat we replace the 1st law with an empirically equivalent\nmathematical rival, such as this one:\n\nMach\u2019s Equation (1960, 287)\n\n\n\\[ \\frac{d^2 (\\frac{\\Sigma mr}{\\Sigma m})}{dt^2} = 0 \\]\n\n\n\nIn this equation the sums are to be taken over all massive bodies in\nthe universe. Since the top sum is weighted by distance, distant\nmasses count much more than near ones. In a world with a (reasonably)\nstatic distribution of heavy distant bodies, such as we appear to live\nin, the equation entails that the velocity of a free body will be\nconstant (to an extremely good approximation) in precisely those\nframes that we already consider to be \u2018inertial\u2019 frames.\nThe upshot of this equation is that the frame of the fixed stars plays\nthe role of absolute space in the statement of the 1st law. This\nproposal does not, by itself, offer an alternative to Newtonian\nmechanics, and as Mach himself pointed out, the law is not\nwell-behaved in an infinite universe filled with stars; but the same\ncan perhaps be said of Newton\u2019s law of gravitation (see Malament\n1995, and Norton 1993). But Mach did not offer this equation as a\nproposed law valid in any circumstances; he avers, \u201cit is\nimpossible to say whether the new expression would still represent the\ntrue condition of things if the stars were to perform rapid movements\namong one another.\u201d (p. 289)\n\nIt is not clear whether Mach offered this revised first law as a first\nstep toward a theory that would replace Newton\u2019s mechanics,\nderiving inertial effects from only relative motions, as Leibniz\ndesired. But many other remarks made by Mach in his chapter\ncriticizing absolute space point in this direction, and they have\ngiven birth to the Mach-heavy view, later to be christened\n\u201cMach\u2019s Principle\u201d by Albert\n Einstein.[2]\n The Mach-heavy viewpoint calls for a new mechanics that invokes only\nrelative distances and (perhaps) their 1st and 2nd time derivatives,\nand thus is \u2018generally relativistic\u2019 in the sense\nsometimes read into Leibniz\u2019s remarks about motion (see\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n section 6). Mach wished to eliminate absolute time from physics too,\nso he would have wanted a proper relationist reduction of these\nderivatives also. The Barbour-Bertotti theories, discussed below,\nprovide this.\n\nMach-heavy apparently involves the prediction of novel effects due to\n\u2018merely\u2019 relative accelerations. Mach hints at such\neffects in his criticism of Newton\u2019s bucket:\n\nNewton\u2019s experiment with the rotating vessel of water simply\ninforms us that the relative rotation of the water with respect to the\nsides of the vessel produces no noticeable centrifugal forces, but\nthat such forces are produced by its relative rotation with respect to\nthe mass of the earth and the other celestial bodies. No one is\ncompetent to say how the experiment would turn out if the sides of the\nvessel [were] increased until they were ultimately several leagues\nthick. (1883, 284)\n\n\nThe suggestion here seems to be that the relative rotation in stage\n(i) of the experiment might immediately generate an outward force\n(before any rotation is communicated to the water), if the sides of\nthe bucket were massive enough. (Note that this response could not\nhave been made by Leibniz \u2013 even if he had wanted to defend\nMachian relationism \u2013 because it involves action at a distance\nbetween the water and the parts of the bucket, something he regarded\nas a metaphysical absurdity.)\n\n\n\nMach\u2019s thick-sided bucket\n\n\nMore generally, Mach-heavy involves the view that all inertial effects\nshould be derived from the motions of the body in question relative to\nall other massive bodies in the universe. The water in Newton\u2019s\nbucket feels an outward pull due (mainly) to the relative rotation of\nall the fixed stars around it. Mach-heavy is a speculation that an\neffect something like electromagnetic induction should be built into\ngravity theory. (Such an effect does exist according to the General\nTheory of Relativity, and is called \u2018gravitomagnetic\ninduction\u2019. The Gravity Probe B mission was designed to measure\na gravitomagnetic induction effect on orbiting gyroscopes due to the\nEarth\u2019s rotation.) Its specific form must fall off with distance\nmuch more slowly than \\(1/r^2\\), if the theory is to be empirically\nsimilar to Newtonian physics; but it will certainly predict\nexperimentally testable novel behaviors. A theory that satisfies all\nthe goals of Mach-heavy would appear to be ideal for the vindication\nof strict relationism and the elimination of absolute quantities of\nmotion from mechanics.\n1.2 Implementing Mach-heavy\n\nDirect assault on the problem of satisfying Mach-heavy in a classical\nframework proved unsuccessful for a long time, despite the efforts of\nothers besides Mach \u2013 for example, Friedl\u00e4nder (1896),\nF\u00f6pl (1904), and Reissner (1914, 1915). (Between the late 19th\ncentury and the 1970s, there was of course one extremely important\nattempt to satisfy Mach-heavy: the work of Einstein that led to the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity. Since Einstein\u2019s efforts took\nplace in a non-classical (Lorentz/Einstein/Minkowski) spacetime\nsetting, we discuss them in the next section.) One very influential\napproach to implementing Mach-heavy was promulgated in the work of\nBarbour and Bertotti (1977); this has since developed into the\nresearch programme of \u2018shape dynamics\u2019, and will be\ndiscussed in more detail in section 3 below.\n1.3 Mach-lite versus Mach-heavy\n\nMach-lite, like the relational interpretations of Newtonian physics\nreviewed in the entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n section 5, offers us a way of understanding Newtonian physics without\naccepting absolute position, velocity or acceleration. But it does so\nin a way that lacks theoretical clarity and elegance, since it does\nnot delimit a clear set of cosmological models. We know that Mach-lite\nmakes the same predictions as Newtonian physics for worlds in which\nthere is a static frame associated with the stars and galaxies; but if\nasked about how things will behave in a world with no frame of fixed\nstars, or in which the stars are far from \u2018fixed\u2019, it\nshrugs and refuses to answer. (Recall that Mach-lite simply says:\n\u201cNewton\u2019s laws hold in the frame of reference of the fixed\nstars.\u201d) This is perfectly acceptable according to Mach\u2019s\nphilosophy of science, since the job of mechanics is simply to\nsummarize observable facts in an economical way. But it is\nunsatisfying to those with stronger realist intuitions about laws of\nnature.\n\nIf there is, in fact, a distinguishable privileged frame of reference\nin which the laws of mechanics take on a specially simple form,\nwithout that frame being determined in any way by relation to the\nmatter distribution, a realist will find it hard to resist the\ntemptation to view motions described in that frame as the\n\u2018true\u2019 or \u2018absolute\u2019 motions. If there is a\nfamily of such frames, disagreeing about velocity but all agreeing\nabout acceleration, then the realist will feel a temptation to think\nof at least acceleration as \u2018true\u2019 or\n\u2018absolute\u2019. If such a realist believes motion to be by\nnature a relation rather than a property (and not all philosophers\naccept this; see the entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n section 1) then they will feel obliged to accord some sort of\nexistence or reality to the structure \u2013 e.g., the structure of\nGalilean spacetime \u2013 in relation to which these motions are\ndefined. For philosophers with such realist inclinations, the ideal\nrelational account of motion would therefore be some version of\nMach-heavy.\n2. Einstein\n\nEinstein\u2019s Special Theory of Relativity (STR) is notionally\nbased on a principle of relativity of motion; but that principle is\n\u2018special\u2019 \u2013 meaning, restricted. The relativity\nprinciple built into STR is in fact nothing other than the Galilean\nprinciple of relativity, which is built into Newtonian\n physics.[3]\n In other words, while there is no privileged standard of velocity,\nthere is nevertheless a determinate fact of the matter about whether a\nbody has accelerated or non-accelerated (i.e., inertial) motion. In\nthis regard, the spacetime of STR is exactly like Galilean spacetime\n(discussed in the entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n section 5). In terms of the question of whether all motion can be\nconsidered purely relative, one could argue that there is nothing new\nbrought to the table by the introduction of Einstein\u2019s STR\n\u2013 at least, as far as mechanics is concerned. (See the entry on\n space and time: inertial frames\n for a more detailed discussion.)\n2.1 Relations Determine State of Motion?\n\nIn this subsection we will discuss an interesting sense in which, in\nSTR, the letter (if not the spirit) of classical relationism can be\nconsidered vindicated: the spatio-temporal relations between material\nthings are, on their own, sufficient to fully determine the state of\nmotion of a body. The discussion here presupposes acquaintance with\nSTR and its basic mathematics, and will be hard to follow for readers\nlacking that background; such readers should feel free to skip this\nsubsection, which is not necessary for following the material in the\nrest of section 2.\n\nAs Dorling (1978) first pointed out, there is a sense in which the\nstandard absolutist arguments against \u2018strict\u2019 relationism\nusing rotating objects (buckets or globes) fail in the context of STR.\nMaudlin (1993) used the same considerations to show that there is a\nway of recasting relationism in STR that appears to be successful. STR\nincorporates certain novelties concerning the nature of time and\nspace, and how they mesh together; perhaps the best-known examples are\nthe phenomena of \u2018length contraction\u2019, \u2018time\ndilation\u2019, and the \u2018relativity of\n simultaneity.\u2019[4]\n In STR both spatial distances and time intervals between events\n\u2013 when measured in the standard ways \u2013 are frame-relative\n(observers in different states of motion, i.e. at rest in different\nreference frames, will \u2018disagree\u2019 about their sizes). The\nstandard classical relationist starting point \u2013 the\nconfiguration of relative distances between the existing bodies at\na moment of time \u2013 does not exist, at least not as an\nobjective, observer- or frame-independent set of facts. Because of\nthis, when considering what spatial or temporal relations a\nrelationist should postulate as fundamental, it is arguably most\nnatural to restrict oneself to the frame-invariant spatiotemporal\n\u2018distance\u2019 between events in spacetime. This is given by\nthe interval between two points: \\([\\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2 +\n\\Delta z^2 - \\Delta t^2]\\) \u2013 the four-dimensional analog of the\nPythagorean theorem, for spacetime distances. If one regards the\nspacetime interval relations between point-masses-at-times as\none\u2019s basis, on which spacetime is built up as an ideal entity\n(analogously to how Leibniz thought of 3-d space as an ideal entity\nabstracted from spatial distance relations), then with only mild\ncaveats relationism works: the spacetime interval relations suffice to\nuniquely fix how the material systems can be embedded (up to\nisomorphism) in the \u2018Minkowski\u2019 spacetime of STR. The\nmodern variants of Newton\u2019s bucket and globes arguments no\nlonger stymie the relationist because (for example) the spacetime\ninterval relations among bits of matter in Newton\u2019s bucket at\nrest are quite different from the spacetime interval relations found\namong those same bits of matter after the bucket is rotating. For\nexample, the spacetime interval relation between a bit of\nwater near the side of the bucket, at one time, and itself (say) a\nsecond later is smaller than the interval relation between a\ncenter-bucket bit of water and itself one second later (times referred\nto inertial-frame clocks). The upshot is that, unlike the situation in\nclassical physics, a non-rotating body cannot have all the same\nspatiotemporal relations among its parts as a similar body in\nrotation. We cannot put a body or system into a state of rotation (or\nother acceleration) without thereby changing the spacetime interval\nrelations between the various bits of matter at different moments of\ntime, compared to what they would have been if the body had remained\nnon-accelerated or non-rotated. The facts about rotation and\nacceleration, thus, supervene on spacetime interval\n relations.[5]\n\nIt is worth pausing to consider to what extent this victory for (some\nform of) relationism satisfies the classical \u2018strict\u2019\nrelationism traditionally ascribed to Mach and Leibniz. The\nspatiotemporal relations that save the day against the bucket and\nglobes are, so to speak, mixed spatial and temporal distances. They\nare thus quite different from the spatial-distances-at-a-time\npresupposed by classical relationists; moreover they do not correspond\nto relative velocities (-at-a-time) either. Their oddity is forcefully\ncaptured by noticing that if we choose appropriate bits of matter at\n\u2018times\u2019 eight minutes apart, I-now am at zero\ndistance from the surface of the sun (of eight minutes\n\u2018past\u2019, since it took 8 minutes for light from the sun to\nreach me-now). So we are by no means dealing here with an innocuous,\n\u2018natural\u2019 translation of classical relationist quantities\ninto the STR setting. On the other hand, in light of the relativity of\nsimultaneity (see\n footnote 5),\n it can be argued that the absolute simultaneity presupposed by\nclassical relationists and absolutists alike was, in fact, something\nthat relationists should always have regarded with misgivings. From\nthis perspective, instantaneous relational configurations \u2013\nprecisely what one starts with in the theories of Barbour and Bertotti\ndiscussed below \u2013 would be the things that should be treated\nwith suspicion.\n\nIf we now return to our questions about motions \u2013 about the\nnature of velocities and accelerations \u2013 we find, as noted\nabove, that matters in the interval-relational interpretation of STR\nare much the same as in Newtonian mechanics in Galilean spacetime.\nThere are no well-defined absolute velocities, but there are indeed\nwell-defined absolute accelerations and rotations. In fact, the\ndifference between an accelerating body (e.g., a rocket) and an\ninertially moving body is codified directly in the cross-temporal\ninterval relations of the body with itself. So we are very\nfar from being able to conclude that all motion is relative motion of\na body with respect to other bodies. It is true that the\nabsolute motions are in 1\u20131 correlation with patterns of\nspacetime interval relations, but it is not at all correct to say that\nthey are, for that reason, eliminable in favor of merely relative\nmotions. Rather we should simply say that no absolute acceleration can\nfail to have an effect on the material body or bodies accelerated. But\nthis was already true in classical physics if matter is modeled\nrealistically: the cord connecting the globes does not merely tense,\nbut also stretches; and so does the bucket, even if imperceptibly,\ni.e., the spatial relations change.\n\nMaudlin does not claim this version of relationism to be victorious\nover an absolutist or substantivalist conception of Minkowski\nspacetime, when it comes time to make judgments about the\ntheory\u2019s ontology. There may be more to vindicating relationism\nthan merely establishing a 1\u20131 correlation between absolute\nmotions and patterns of spatiotemporal relations.\n2.2 The Relationist Roots of STR and GTR\n\nThe simple comparison made above between STR and Newtonian physics in\nGalilean spacetime is somewhat deceptive. For one thing, Galilean\nspacetime is a mathematical innovation posterior to\nEinstein\u2019s 1905 theory; before then, Galilean spacetime had not\nbeen conceived, and full acceptance of Newtonian mechanics implied\naccepting absolute velocities and, arguably, absolute positions, just\nas laid down in the Scholium. So Einstein\u2019s elimination\nof absolute velocity was a genuine conceptual advance. Moreover, the\nScholium was not the only reason for supposing that there\nexisted a privileged reference frame of \u2018rest\u2019: the\nworking assumption of almost all physicists in the latter half of the\n19th century was that, in order to understand the wave theory of\nlight, one had to postulate an aetherial medium filling all space,\nwave-like disturbances in which constituted electromagnetic radiation.\nIt was assumed that the aether rest frame would be an inertial\nreference frame; and physicists felt some temptation to equate its\nframe with the absolute rest frame, though this was not necessary.\nRegardless of this equation of the aether with absolute space, it was\nassumed by all 19th century physicists that the equations of\nelectrodynamic theory would have to look different in a reference\nframe moving with respect to the aether than they did in the\naether\u2019s rest frame (where they presumably take their canonical\nform, i.e., Maxwell\u2019s equations and the Lorentz force law). So\nwhile theoreticians labored to find plausible transformation rules for\nthe electrodynamics of moving bodies, experimentalists tried to detect\nthe Earth\u2019s motion in the aether. Experiment and theory played\ncollaborative roles, with experimental results ruling out certain\ntheoretical moves and suggesting new ones, while theoretical advances\ncalled for new experimental tests for their confirmation or \u2013 as\nit happened \u2013 disconfirmation.\n\nAs is well known, attempts to detect the Earth\u2019s velocity in the\naether were unsuccessful. On the theory side, attempts to formulate\nthe transformation laws for electrodynamics in moving frames \u2013\nin such a way as to be compatible with experimental results \u2013\nwere complicated and\n inelegant.[6]\n A simplified way of seeing how Einstein swept away a host of problems\nat a stroke is this: he proposed that the Galilean principle of\nrelativity holds for Maxwell\u2019s theory, not just for mechanics.\nThe canonical (\u2018rest-frame\u2019) form of Maxwell\u2019s\nequations should be their form in any inertial reference\nframe. Since the Maxwell equations dictate the velocity c of\nelectromagnetic radiation (light), this entails that any inertial\nobserver, no matter how fast she is moving, will measure the velocity\nof a light ray as c \u2013 no matter what the relative\nvelocity of its emitter may be. Einstein worked out logically the\nconsequences of this application of the special relativity principle,\nand discovered that space and time must be rather different from how\nNewton described them. STR undermined Newton\u2019s absolute time\njust as decisively as it undermined his absolute space.\n2.3 From Special Relativity to General Relativity\n\nEinstein\u2019s STR was the first clear and empirically successful\nphysical theory to overtly eliminate the concepts of absolute rest and\nabsolute velocity while recovering most of the successes of\nclassical mechanics and 19th century electrodynamics. It therefore\ndeserves to be considered the first highly successful theory to\nexplicitly relativize motion, albeit only partially. But STR only\nrecovered most of the successes of classical physics: crucially, it\nleft out gravity. And there was certainly reason to be concerned that\nNewtonian gravity and STR would prove incompatible: classical gravity\nacted instantaneously at a distance, while STR eliminated the\nprivileged absolute simultaneity that this instantaneous action\npresupposes.\n\nSeveral ways of modifying Newtonian gravity to make it compatible with\nthe spacetime structure of STR suggested themselves to physicists in\nthe years 1905\u20131912, and a number of interesting\nLorentz-covariant theories were proposed (i.e., theories compatible\nwith the spacetime of STR, which is called \u2018Minkowski\nspacetime\u2019 because Hermann Minkowski first revealed the\nspacetime structure that Einstein\u2019s postulates in STR entail).\nEinstein rejected these proposed theories one and all, for violating\neither empirical facts or theoretical desiderata. But Einstein\u2019s\nchief reason for not pursuing the reconciliation of gravitation with\nSTR\u2019s spacetime appears to have been his desire, beginning in\n1907, to replace STR with a theory in which not only velocity could be\nconsidered merely relative, but also acceleration. That is to say,\nEinstein wanted if possible to completely eliminate all absolute\nquantities of motion from physics, thus realizing a theory that\nsatisfies at least one kind of \u2018strict\u2019 relationism.\n(Regarding Einstein\u2019s rejection of Lorentz-covariant gravity\ntheories, see Norton 1992; regarding Einstein\u2019s quest to fully\nrelativize motion, see Hoefer 1994.)\n\nEinstein began to see this complete relativization as possible in\n1907, thanks to his discovery of the Equivalence Principle (cf.\nLehmkuhl forthcoming). Imagine we are far out in space, in a\nrocket ship accelerating at a constant rate \\(g = 9.81 m/s^2.\\) Things\nwill feel just like they do on the surface of the Earth; we will feel\na clear up-down direction, bodies will fall to the floor when\nreleased, etc. Indeed, due to the well-known empirical fact that\ngravity affects all bodies by imparting a force proportional to their\nmatter (and energy) content, independent of their internal\nconstitution, we know that any experiment performed on this rocket\nwill give the same results that the same experiment would give if\nperformed on the Earth. Now, Newtonian theory teaches us to consider\nthe apparent downward, gravity-like forces in the rocket ship as\n\u2018pseudo-forces\u2019 or \u2018inertial forces\u2019, and\ninsists that they are to be explained by the fact that the ship is\naccelerating in absolute space. But Einstein asked whether there is\nany way for the person in the rocket to regard him/herself as being\n\u2018at rest\u2019 rather than in absolute (accelerated) motion?\nAnd the answer he gave is: Yes. The rocket traveler may regard\nhim/herself as being \u2018at rest\u2019 in a homogeneous and\nuniform gravitational field. Such a field would entail an accelerative\nforce \u201cdownward\u201d on every body that is equal in magnitude\nand direction everywhere in space. This is unlike the Earth\u2019s\ngravitational field, which varies depending on distance from the\nEarth\u2019s center and points in different directions at different\nlocations. Positing the existence of such a field will explain all the\nobservational facts just as well as the supposition that he/she is\naccelerating relative to absolute space (or, absolutely accelerating\nin Minkowski spacetime). But is it not clear that the latter is the\ntruth, while the former is a fiction? By no means; if there\nwere a uniform gravitational field filling all space, then it\nwould affect all the other bodies in the world \u2013 the Earth, the\nstars, etc, \u2013 imparting to them a downward acceleration away\nfrom the rocket; and that is exactly what the traveler observes.\n\nIn 1907 Einstein published his first gravitation theory (Einstein\n1907), treating the gravitational field as a scalar field that also\nrepresented the (now variable and frame-dependent) speed of light.\nEinstein viewed the theory as only a first step on the road to\neliminating absolute motion. In the 1907 theory, the theory\u2019s\nequations take the same form in any inertial or uniformly\naccelerating frame of reference. One might say that this theory\nreduces the class of absolute motions, leaving only rotation and other\nnon-uniform accelerations as absolute. But, Einstein reasoned, if\nuniform acceleration can be regarded as equivalent to being at rest in\na constant gravitational field, why should it not be possible also to\nregard inertial effects from these other, non-uniform motions as\nsimilarly equivalent to \u201cbeing at rest in a (variable)\ngravitational field\u201d? Thus Einstein set himself the goal of\nexpanding the principle of equivalence to embrace all forms of\n\u2018accelerated\u2019 motion.\n\nEinstein thought that the key to achieving this aim lay in further\nexpanding the range of reference frames in which the laws of physics\ntake their canonical form, to include frames adapted to any arbitrary\nmotions. More specifically, since the class of all continuous and\ndifferentiable coordinate systems includes as a proper subclass the\ncoordinate systems adapted to any such frame of reference, if he could\nachieve a theory of gravitation, electromagnetism and mechanics that\nwas generally covariant \u2013 its equations taking the same\nform in any coordinate system from this general class \u2013 then the\ncomplete relativity of motion would be achieved. If there are no\nspecial frames of reference in which the laws take on a simpler\ncanonical form, there is no physical reason to consider any particular\nstate or states of motion as privileged, nor deviations from those as\nrepresenting \u2018absolute motion\u2019. (Here we are just laying\nout Einstein\u2019s train of thought; later we will see reasons to\nquestion the last step.) And in 1915, Einstein achieved his aim in the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity (GTR).\n2.4 General Relativity and Relativity of Motion\n\nThere is one key element left out of this success story, however, and\nit is crucial to understanding why most physicists reject\nEinstein\u2019s claim to have eliminated absolute states of motion in\nGTR. Going back to our accelerating rocket, we accepted\nEinstein\u2019s claim that we could regard the ship as hovering at\nrest in a universe-filling gravitational field. But a gravitational\nfield, we usually suppose, is generated by matter. How is this\nuniverse-filling field linked to generating matter? The answer may be\nsupplied by Mach-heavy. Regarding the \u2018accelerating\u2019\nrocket which we decide to regard as \u2018at rest\u2019 in a\ngravitational field, the Machian says: all those stars and galaxies,\netc., jointly accelerating downward (relative to the rocket),\n\u2018produce\u2019 that gravitational field. The mathematical\nspecifics of how this field is generated will have to be different\nfrom Newton\u2019s law of gravity, of course; but it should give\nessentially the same results when applied to low-mass, slow-moving\nproblems such as the orbits of the planets, so as to capture the\nempirical successes of Newtonian gravity. Einstein thought, in 1916 at\nleast, that the field equations of GTR are precisely this mathematical\nreplacement for Newton\u2019s law of gravity, and that they fully\nsatisfied the desiderata of Mach-heavy relationism. But it was not so.\n(See the entry on\n early philosophical interpretations of general relativity.)\n\nIn GTR, spacetime is locally very much like STR\u2019s flat Minkowski\nspacetime. There is no absolute velocity locally, but there are clear\nlocal standards of accelerated vs non-accelerated motion, i.e., local\ninertial frames. In these \u2018freely falling\u2019 frames bodies\nobey the usual rules for non-gravitational physics familiar from STR,\nalbeit only approximately (this is sometimes called the \u2018strong\nequivalence principle\u2019, and is discussed further in section 4\nbelow). But overall spacetime is curved, and local inertial frames may\ntip, bend and twist as we move from one region to another. The\nstructure of curved spacetime is encoded in the metric field tensor\ngab, with the curvature encoding gravity\nat the same time: gravitational forces are so to speak \u2018built\ninto\u2019 the metric field, geometrized away. Since the spacetime\nstructure encodes gravity and inertia, and in a Mach-heavy theory\nthese phenomena should be completely determined by the relational\ndistribution of matter (and relative motions), Einstein wished to see\nthe metric as entirely determined by the distribution of matter and\nenergy. But what the GTR field equations entail is, in general, only a\npartial-determination relation.\n\nWe cannot go into the mathematical details necessary for a full\ndiscussion of the successes and failures of Mach-heavy in the GTR\ncontext. But one can see why the Machian interpretation Einstein hoped\nhe could give to the curved spacetimes of his theory fails to be\nplausible, by considering a few simple \u2018worlds\u2019 permitted\nby GTR. In the first place, for our hovering rocket ship, if we are to\nattribute the gravity field it feels to matter, there has got to\nbe all this other matter in the universe. But if we regard\nthe rocket as a mere \u2018test body\u2019 (not itself substantially\naffecting the gravity present or absent in the universe), then we can\nnote that according to GTR, if we remove all the stars, galaxies,\nplanets etc. from the world, the gravitational field does not\ndisappear. On the contrary, it stays basically the same locally, and\nglobally, in the simplest solution of the field equations, it takes\nthe form of empty Minkowski spacetime \u2013 precisely the\nquasi-absolute structure Einstein was hoping to eliminate. Solutions\nof the GTR field equations for arbitrary realistic configurations of\nmatter (e.g., a rocket ship ejecting a stream of particles to push\nitself forward) are hard to come by, and in fact a realistic two-body\nexact solution has yet to be discovered. But numerical methods can be\napplied for many purposes, and physicists do not doubt that something\nlike our accelerating rocket \u2013 in otherwise empty space \u2013\nis possible according to the\n theory.[7]\n We see clearly, then, that GTR fails to satisfy Einstein\u2019s own\nunderstanding of Mach\u2019s Principle, according to which, in the\nabsence of matter, space itself should not be able to exist.\n\nA second example: GTR allows us to model a single rotating\nobject in an otherwise empty universe (e.g., a neutron star).\nRelationism of the Machian variety says that such rotation is\nimpossible, since it can only be understood as rotation relative to\nsome sort of absolute space. In the case of GTR, this is indeed the\nnatural way to understand such a model: the rotation is best\nunderstood as rotation relative to a \u2018background\u2019\nspacetime that is identical to the Minkowski spacetime of STR, only\n\u2018curved\u2019 by the presence of matter in the region of the\nstar.\n\nOn the other hand, there is one charge of failure-to-relativize-motion\nsometimes leveled at GTR that is unfair. It is sometimes asserted that\nthe simple fact that the metric field (or the connection it\ndetermines) distinguishes, at every location, motions that are\n\u2018absolutely\u2019 accelerated and/or \u2018absolutely\nrotating\u2019 from those that are not, by itself entails that GTR\nfails to embody a folk-Leibniz style general relativity of motion\n(e.g. Earman (1989), ch. 5). We think this is incorrect, and leads to\nunfairly harsh judgments about confusion on Einstein\u2019s part. The\nlocal inertial structure encoded in the metric would not be\n\u2018absolute\u2019 in any meaningful sense, if that structure were\nin some clear sense fully determined by the relationally specified\nmatter-energy distribution. Einstein was not simply confused\nwhen he named his gravity theory. (Just what is to be understood by\n\u201cthe relationally specified matter-energy distribution\u201d is\na further, thorny issue, which we cannot enter into here.)\n\nGTR does not fulfill all the goals of Mach-heavy, at least as\nunderstood by Einstein, and he recognized this fact by 1918 (Einstein\n1918). And yet \u2026 GTR comes tantalizingly close to achieving\nthose goals, in certain striking ways (cf. Hoefer 2014). For one\nthing, GTR does predict Mach-heavy effects, known as\n\u2018frame-dragging\u2019: if we could model Mach\u2019s\nthick-walled bucket in GTR, it seems clear that it would pull the\nwater slightly outward, and give it a slight tendency to begin\nrotating in the same sense as the bucket (even if the big\nbucket\u2019s walls were not actually touching the water). While GTR\ndoes permit us to model a lone rotating object, if we model the object\nas a shell of mass (instead of a solid sphere) and let the size of the\nshell increase (to model the \u2018sphere of the fixed stars\u2019\nwe see around us), then as Brill & Cohen (1966) showed, the\nframe-dragging becomes complete inside the shell. In other words: our\noriginal Minkowski background structure effectively disappears, and\ninertia becomes wholly determined by the shell of matter, just as Mach\nposited was the case. This complete determination of inertia by the\nglobal matter distribution appears to be a feature of other models,\nincluding the Friedman-Lem\u00e2itre-Robertson-Walker Big Bang models\nthat best match observations of our universe.\n\nFinally, it is important to recognize that GTR is generally covariant\nin a very special sense: unlike all other prior theories (and unlike\nmany subsequent quantum theories), it postulates no fixed\n\u2018prior\u2019 or \u2018background\u2019 spacetime structure.\nAs mathematicians and physicists realized early on, other theories,\ne.g., Newtonian mechanics and STR, can be put into a generally\ncovariant form. But when this is done, there are inevitably\nmathematical objects postulated as part of the formalism, whose role\nis to represent absolute elements of spacetime structure (see Friedman\n1983, Pooley 2017). What is unique about GTR is that it was the first,\nand is still the only \u2018core\u2019 physical theory, to have no\nsuch absolute elements in its covariant equations. (Whether these\nclaims are exactly correct is a matter of ongoing debate, relating to\nthe question of the \u2018background independence\u2019 of GTR: for\ndiscussion, see e.g. Belot (2011), Pitts (2006), Read (2016), and\nPooley (2017).) The spacetime structure in GTR, represented by the\nmetric field, is at least partly \u2018shaped\u2019 by the\ndistribution of matter and energy. And in certain models of the\ntheory, such as the Big Bang cosmological models, some authors have\nclaimed that the local standards of inertial motion \u2013 the local\n\u2018gravitational field\u2019 of Einstein\u2019s equivalence\nprinciple \u2013 are entirely fixed by the matter distribution\nthroughout space and time, just as Mach-heavy requires (see, for\nexample, Wheeler and Cuifollini 1995).\n\nAbsolutists and relationists are thus left in a frustrating and\nperplexing quandary by GTR. Considering its anti-Machian models, we\nare inclined to say that motions such as rotation and acceleration\nremain absolute, or nearly-totally-absolute, according to the theory.\nOn the other hand, considering its most Mach-friendly models, which\ninclude all the models taken to be good candidates for representing\nthe actual universe, we may be inclined to say: motion in our\nworld is entirely relative; the inertial effects normally used to\nargue for absolute motion are all understandable as effects of\nrotations and accelerations relative to the cosmic matter, just as\nMach hoped. But even if we agree that motions in our world are in fact\nall relative in this sense, this does not automatically settle the\ntraditional relationist/absolutist debate, much less the\nrelationist/substantivalist debate. Many philosophers (including, we\nsuspect, Nerlich 1994 and Earman 1989) would be happy to acknowledge\nthe Mach-friendly status of our spacetime, and argue nevertheless that\nwe should understand that spacetime as a real thing, more like a\nsubstance than a mere ideal construct of the mind as Leibniz insisted.\nBy contrast, other philosophers (e.g., Rynasiewicz 1995) argue that\ndue to the conceptual and mathematical novelties introduced in GTR,\nthe traditional absolute vs. relational motion debate simply fails to\nmake sense any more (on this question, see also Hoefer 1998).\n3. Shape Dynamics\n\nWe turn now to a modern-day attempt to implement Mach-heavy known as\n\u2018shape dynamics\u2019. (In fact, shape dynamics is just one\ntheory within this tradition, as we will see below.) This approach was\ninitiated \u2013 albeit not under that name \u2013 by Barbour and\nBertotti (1977, 1982). In tackling the problem of implementing\nMach-heavy, rather than formulating a revised law of gravity/inertia\nusing relative quantities, Barbour and Bertotti used the framework of\nLagrangian mechanics, replacing elements of the mathematics referring\nto absolute quantities of motion with new terms invoking only relative\ndistances, velocities, etc. In this section, we presuppose a basic\nfamiliarity with the Lagrangian framework. For a non-technical\nintroduction to shape dynamics, see Barbour (1999); for an up-to-date\nreview of recent work in the field, see Mercati (2018).\n\nIn this section, we survey the results and motivations of the shape\ndynamics research program, focussing first on the above-mentioned\ntheory of Barbour and Bertotti (which recovers a subsection of the\nsolution space of Newtonian particle theory), before turning to the\nMachian alternative to general relativity developed by Barbour and\ncollaborators: it is this latter theory which is shape dynamics\n\u2018proper\u2019. Readers uninterested in the technical details of\nthis work can skip to section 3.5, in which its conceptual upshots are\ndiscussed.\n3.1. Configuration Space\n\nFor a given physical system, define its \u2018configuration\nspace\u2019 to be the space of possible instantaneous states of that\nsystem. (For example, the space of possible distributions of N\nparticles in Euclidean space, according to a Cartesian coordinate\nsystem laid down on that space.) As the system evolves, the point in\nconfiguration space representing the system\u2019s instantaneous\nstate traces out a continuous curve. On this picture, metaphysically\npossible worlds are represented by (rising) curves in the product\nspace formed from configuration space and a one-dimensional space\nrepresenting time. Nomologically possible worlds are represented by\nthose curves that are allowed by the dynamics. For example, in the\nLagrangian formalism, the nomologically possible worlds are\nrepresented by those curves which extremize the action: a particular\nfunctional of such curves.\n\nConsider now, for the sake of concreteness, two Newtonian worlds which\ndiffer by either a static or a kinematic Leibniz shift: that is,\nconstant translations or velocity boosts of the material content of\nthe universe (see the companion entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n for further discussion of such shifts). These two worlds will be\nrepresented by distinct curves in configuration space. However, given\na configuration space, one can construct a \u2018reduced\u2019\nconfiguration space, in which certain such histories are\nmathematically identified, or \u2018quotiented\u2019, such that they\nare mapped to the same unique history in reduced configuration space.\nSpecifically, proponents of this approach define two such reduced\nconfiguration spaces:\n\n\u2018Relative configuration space\u2019, which is configuration\nspace quotiented by rigid translations and rotations. (I.e., curves in\nconfiguration space which represent worlds which differ by rigid\ntranslations or rotations are mathematically identified.)\n\u2018Shape space\u2019, which its configuration space\nquotiented by rigid translations, rotations, and dilatations. (I.e.,\ncurves in configuration space which represent worlds which differ by\nrigid translations, rotations, or dilatations are mathematically\nidentified.)\n\n\n(Two points here. First, recall that a \u2018dilatation\u2019 is a\nscale transformation. Second, in what follows we will refer to the\ngroup which consists of the union of translations, rotations and\ndilatations as the \u2018similarity group\u2019.) If these Machian\ntheorists are able to formulate a dynamics on shape space (i.e., a\ndynamics which identifies the curves in shape space which represent\nnomologically possible worlds), then that dynamics will, in light of\nthe above reduction, not bring with it a meaningful notion of absolute\nposition, or absolute velocity, or absolute scales. Barbour and\ncollaborators take such a dynamics to realize Mach-heavy: the\nundetectable spacetime structure associated with such quantities has\nbeen expunged. Below, we will see how this can be done in the concrete\ncontexts of Newtonian particle dynamics and general relativity.\n3.2. Emergent Temporality\n\nThe Machian ambitions of Barbour and collaborators do not end there,\nfor these authors also seek to excise primitive temporal structure.\nInitially, one might distinguish histories that correspond to a single\ncurve in configuration space being traced out at different rates with\nrespect to the primitive temporal parameter. Those working in this\ntradition, however, view each curve in configuration space as\ncorresponding to exactly one possible history. They therefore elect to\ndispose of the auxiliary one-dimensional space representing a\nprimitive absolute time which was introduced above. Instead, they seek\nto construct an \u2018emergent\u2019 notion of temporality from\ndynamics defined on configuration space alone. By way of a procedure\nknown as \u2018Jacobi\u2019s principle\u2019, the Machian\nrelationist selects a unique temporal parameter which maximally\nsimplifies this dynamics defined on configuration space. For the\ndetails of Jacobi\u2019s principle, see Pooley (2013).\n3.3. Best Matching\n\nIt is all well and good speaking of a dynamics defined on relative\nconfiguration space, or shape space. However, it remains incumbent on\nour Machian theorists to construct explicit dynamics appropriate for\nthese spaces: i.e., dynamics which do not recognise solutions related\nby the action of the similarity group (viz., translations, rotations,\nand dilatations) as being distinct. Given a dynamics on configuration\nspace, one can indeed achieve this task. The procedure which\nimplements this is known as \u2018best matching\u2019, and was\ndeveloped in the seminal work of Barbour and Bertotti (1982), in which\na version of Newtonian particle mechanics with dynamics formulated on\nrelative configuration space was first constructed. The extension to\nshape space was undertaken in (Barbour 2003).\n\nInformally, the goal of best matching is to use the similarity group\nto minimize the intrinsic difference between successive points along a\nhistory in configuration space. To take a simple example drawn from\nBarbour (1999), consider the history of a particular triangle: the\ntriangle may, along that history, rotate, dilate, alter its internal\nangles, and so on. However, at each point best matching allows one to\nact on the triangle with similarity transformations; thereby,\ntriangles which at successive points along a history differ merely by\na translation, rotation or dilatation will be regarded as being\nidentical after best matching. In this way, a \u2018best\nmatched\u2019 history is selected, in which the intrinsic differences\nbetween successive states of the system under consideration (in the\nabove example, the triangle) are minimised. While a metric on\nconfiguration space will in general assign a different length to\nhistories differing by the action of the similarity group, the length\nof the best matched history, constructed via the above procedure, will\ninduce a unique length of paths, and therefore metric, on shape\nspace.\n\nA little more formally, the best matching procedure works as follows.\nConsider a class of paths in configuration space, all corresponding to\nthe same path in shape space (i.e., consider a class of paths in\nconfiguration space related by the action of the similarity group). As\nmentioned above, a given metric on configuration space will in general\nassign to each path in that space a different length; as a result, the\nlength of the associated path in shape space will be underdetermined.\nHowever, starting from any given point p in configuration space, one\ncan use the action of the similarity group on configuration space to\ndefine a unique curve, by shifting the points of any curve through p\nalong the corresponding orbits of the similarity group (think of these\n\u2018orbits\u2019 as contour lines in configuration space, relating\npoints which differ only by the action of the similarity group) so as\nto extremize the length assigned to the curve (relative to the metric\nunder consideration). It is this extremized length which is assigned\nto the unique curve in shape space. With each curve in shape space\nassigned a unique length, one can then, as usual, specify a principle\nwhich selects some such curves as representing nomologically possible\nworlds, based upon their lengths. (Recall again, for example, that in\nLagrangian mechanics it is those curves which extremize an action\nwhich are regarded as being dynamically possible.)\n3.4. Relativistic Best Matching\n\nThe best matching prescription can be applied not only to Newtonian\nparticle theories, but also to other spacetime theories, including\nGTR. (There is no reason why best matching cannot be applied to\nNewtonian field theories, or to special relativistic particle\ndynamics, but these steps are usually skipped by Machian relationists\nfollowing in the tradition of Barbour and Bertotti, who proceed at\nthis stage straight to GTR.)\n\nTo see how best matching works in the case of GTR, first note that a\ncertain subclass of solutions of that theory (namely, those which are\nglobally hyperbolic) can be formulated in terms of the \u20183+1\nformalism\u2019, according to which the state of the universe at a\nparticular time is represented by a determinate 3-manifold with\nassociated Riemannian metric; dynamical equations then determine how\nsuch 3-geometries evolve in time. (For a summary of the 3+1 formalism,\nsee e.g. Gourgoulhon (2012).) The Machian relationists working in the\nshape dynamics research program take this 3+1 approach to GTR as their\nstarting point. They thus assume that instantaneous spaces which are\nthe points in configuration space have the determinate topology of\nsome closed 3-manifold without boundary. Configuration space is the\nspace of Riemannian 3-metrics on that 3-manifold. The natural analogue\nof relative configuration space is, then, this space of Riemannian\n3-metrics quotiented by diffeomorphisms, which are the generalisations\nof Leibniz shifts appropriate to GTR (see the entry on\n the hole argument).\n The analogue of shape space in this case is the space of Riemannian\n3-metrics, but quotiented in addition by local dilatations (by\n\u2018local\u2019, we mean here a transformation which can vary from\npoint to point).\n\nHaving constructed shape space in the relativistic case, one may then\nbest match in order to construct one\u2019s relational theory\nimplementing Mach-heavy (the metric on configuration space is defined\nfrom the 3+1 dynamics of GTR): conceptually, the approach here is the\nsame as that presented in the previous section. Moreover, one can\nagain apply Jacobi\u2019s principle, in order to eliminate a\ncommitment to primitive temporal structure. In this case, the\nresulting theory is known as \u2018shape dynamics\u2019, which\ninvolves a commitment only to primitive conformal structure (i.e.,\nfacts about angles between objects) on the 3-geometries: all other\nabsolute quantities, the claim goes, have been excised. One way to\nunderstand the relationship between GTR and shape dynamics is that one\ntrades the relativity of simultaneity but absoluteness of scales in\nthe former theory, for absolute simultaneity but the relativity of\nscales in the latter.\n3.5. Conceptual Matters\n\nThere are important differences between the relationship between\n\u2018standard\u2019 Newtonian particle mechanics and its\nbest-matched alternative on the one hand, and the relationship between\nGTR and shape dynamics on the other. In the former case, the class of\nsolutions of the best-matched theory is a proper subset of the\nsolutions of Newtonian mechanics: for example, it includes only the\nsector of the solution space of Newtonian mechanics which ascribes\nzero angular momentum to the entire universe. Sometimes, this is\nmarketed as an advantage of the latter theory: the best-matched theory\npredicts what was, in the Newtonian case, an unexplained coincidence.\n(For discussion, see Pooley & Brown 2002.) In the latter case, by\ncontrast, it has been discovered that one can \u2018glue\u2019\nsolutions of shape dynamics to construct new solutions, which are not\nassociated with any particular solution of GTR (in the sense that they\nare not the best matched equivalents of any solution of GTR): see\n(Mercati 2018). Thus, the solution spaces of GTR and shape dynamics\noverlap, but the latter is not a proper subset of the former. Given\nthis, it is no longer clear that shape dynamics can be presented as a\n\u2018more predictive\u2019 alternative to GTR.\n\nA second conceptual point to make regarding the Machian relationism of\nBarbour and collaborators pertains to its motivations. Barbour claims,\nas we have already seen above, that only spatial angles \u2013 and\nnot spatial scales, or a temporal timescale, or absolute velocities or\npositions \u2013 are directly empirically observable. Thus, the\nthought goes that an empiricist of good standing should favour (say)\nshape dynamics over GTR, for the former theory, unlike the latter,\nrenders only such \u2018directly observable\u2019 quantities\nmeaningful; it does not commit to any absolute quantities which are\nnot \u2018directly observable\u2019. There are, however, two central\npoints at which this reasoning could be questioned. First: one could\nrepudiate Barbour\u2019s empiricist motivations. Second: one could\ndeny that only angles are directly observable, or, indeed, that this\nstructure is directly observable at all (see Pooley 2013, p. 47). As\nPooley points out, these are not the strongest grounds on which to\nmotivate Barbour\u2019s project. Rather, a better motivation is this:\nbest-matched theories have the merit of ontological parsimony, as\ncompared with the theories such as Newtonian particle mechanics or\ngeneral relativity, to which the best-matching procedure is applied. A\nsecond motivation has to do with the potential of this research\nprogramme to present new avenues for exploration in the quest for a\nquantum theory of gravity.\n\nOur third and final point is this. Although it is possible to couple\nshape dynamics to matter (see e.g. (Gomes 2012)), in this theory, just\nas in GTR as discussed in the previous section, one also has vacuum\nsolutions, with primitive conformal structure on the 3-geometries.\nGiven the existence of these vacuum solutions, as with GTR, it is far\nfrom clear that the theory makes good on the ambitions of Mach and the\nearly Einstein to construct a theory in which all spatiotemporal\nnotions are reduced to facts about matter. That said, it is worth\nnoting that, unlike in GTR, in shape dynamics one cannot have\na solution consisting of a single rotating body: the overall angular\nmomentum of the universe must vanish.\n4. The Dynamical Approach\n\nSince 2000, a new \u2018dynamical\u2019 approach to spacetime\nstructure has emerged in the works of Robert DiSalle (2006) and\nespecially Oliver Pooley and Harvey Brown (2001, 2006). This approach\nis to be situated against an opposing, supposedly orthodox\n\u2018geometrical\u2019 approach to spacetime structure, as\nencapsulated in the works of e.g. Janssen (2009) and Maudlin (2012).\n(This is not to say that either the dynamical view or the opposing\ngeometrical view is a unified edifice, as we will see below.) The\ndynamical-geometrical debate has many facets, but one can take the\ncentral bone of contention to pertain to the arrow of explanation: is\nit the case that the geometrical structures of spacetime explain why\nmaterial bodies behave as they do (as the geometrical view would have\nit), or is it rather the case that the geometrical structure of\nspacetime is explained by facts about the behaviour of material bodies\n(as the dynamical view would have it)? Although this debate connects\nwith historical debates between substantivalists and relationists, it\nshould be regarded as a distinct dispute, for reasons to which we will\ncome.\n\nWhile it is important to keep in mind the above disagreement regarding\nthe arrow of explanation when one is considering the\ndynamical-geometrical debate, it will be helpful in this article to\nhone in on two more specific claims of the dynamical approach, as\npresented by Brown (2005), consistent with the above claim that it is\nfacts about the dynamics of material bodies which explain facts about\nspatiotemporal structure, rather than vice versa. These two claims are\nthe following (Read 2020a):\n\nFixed background space-time structures, such as the Minkowski\nspace-time of STR, or Newton\u2019s absolute space, are to be\nontologically reduced to the symmetries of the dynamical equations\ngoverning matter fields.\nNo piece of space-time structure, whether fixed or dynamical (in\nthe latter case, as in GTR) is necessarily surveyed by physical\nbodies; rather, in order to ascertain whether this is so, one must\nattend carefully to the details of the dynamics governing the\nparticular matter fields which constitute physical bodies.\n\n\nOn the first of these two points: proponents of the dynamical approach\nmaintain that the spacetime structure of our world is what it is\nbecause of the dynamical laws of nature and their symmetries.\nThat is, the dynamical laws are (at least, relative to spacetime)\nfundamental, and spacetime structure is derivative; in this sense, the\nview is (at least in some cases) a modern-day form of relationism\n(Pooley 2013, \u00a76.3.2) \u2013 albeit of a very different kind\nfrom the relationist approaches considered up to this point. (Note,\nthough, that this relationism is a corollary of the above\nexplanatory contention of the dynamical approach; moreover, it is one\nwhich is applicable only to theories which fixed spacetime structure\nsuch as Newtonian mechanics or STR \u2013 and therefore not\nto theories with dynamical spacetime structure, such as GTR. For this\nreason, as already indicated above, proponents of the dynamical view\nare not to be identified na\u00efvely with relationists.)\n\nOn the second of these two points: the idea \u2013 what Butterfield\n(2007) calls \u2018Brown\u2019s moral\u2019 \u2013 is that one\ncannot simply posit a piece of geometrical structure in one\u2019s\ntheory, e.g. a Minkowski metric field in STR, and know ab\ninitio that material bodies (in particular rods and clocks) will\nread off intervals of that structure; rather, whether this is the case\nor not will depend upon the constitution of, and dynamics governing,\nthose material bodies. We will see below specific theories in which\nany such assumption seems to fail. Note that this second point is\nagain consistent with the explanatory contention taken above to be\ncharacteristic of the dynamical approach: a given piece of structure\ninherits its operational significance as spacetime by dint of the\nbehaviour of material bodies.\n\nBefore addressing the second of these two points, we should consider\nthe first in greater detail. The claim that fixed spatiotemporal\nstructure is to be ontologically reduced to facts about material\nbodies invites many questions, chief among which is perhaps the\nfollowing: to what could this ontological reduction possibly amount?\nIn the following section, we will see one particular metaphysical\nprogramme which promises to make good on this claim.\n4.1 The Dynamical Approach and Regularity Relationism\n\nThere is arguably a tight relationship between the geometrical\nsymmetries of a spacetime and the symmetries of a theory that\ndescribes the physics of matter (in a broad sense, including fields)\nin it. (Theories such as GTR, in which space-time has its own dynamics\nare more complicated, and will be discussed later; for further\ndiscussion of symmetries in physics, see the entry on\n symmetry and symmetry breaking.)\n Each symmetry is a set of transformations, with a rule of\ncomposition: formally a \u2018group\u2019. For instance, the group\nof rotations in the plane has a distinct element for every angle in\nthe range 0\u2013360 degrees; the composition of two rotations is the\nsingle rotation through the sum of their angles. Spacetime symmetries\nare those transformations which leave invariant a piece of spacetime\nstructure (e.g., the symmetries of Minkowski spacetime are\ntranslations, spatial rotations and Lorentz boosts: together, the\nso-called Poincar\u00e9 transformations); dynamical symmetries are\nthose transformations which leave invariant a set of dynamical\nequations (e.g., the symmetries of Maxwell\u2019s equations of\nelectromagnetism are again the Poincar\u00e9 transformations). There\nare good reasons to hold that the symmetry groups of theory and\nspacetime must agree. First, since the theory describes matter, and\nhence (arguably) what is measurable, any theoretical symmetries not\nreflected in the postulated spacetime structure indicate unmeasurable\ngeometry: for instance, if an absolute present were postulated in\nrelativistic physics. While in the other direction, if there were\nextra spacetime symmetries beyond those found in the dynamics, then\nper impossible one could measure nonexistent geometric\nquantities: for instance, a theory that depends on absolute velocities\ncannot be formulated in Galilean spacetime (see the entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories\n for further discussion of these Newtonian spacetime structures).\nFamously, Earman (1989, ch. 3) declares that the matching of\nspace-time and dynamical symmetries is, thus, an \u2018adequacy\ncondition\u2019 on a physical theory.\n\nGiven this \u2018adequacy condition\u2019, a given geometry for\nspacetime formally constrains the allowable theories to those with the\njust the right symmetries: not too many, and not too few. It was an\nassumption of many substantivalists (the views of whom are discussed\nbelow) that this constraint was not merely formal, but ontological:\nthat the geometry is more fundamental than the laws, or that geometry\noffers a \u2018real\u2019 explanation of the form of the laws\n\u2013 such authors would, by the above categorization, qualify as\nproponents of a geometrical view. However, that the symmetries should\nagree does not specify any direction of dependence, and it could be\nreversed, so that the geometric symmetries are ontologically\ndetermined by those of the laws of the theory: hence the geometry\nitself is an expression of the (symmetry properties of the) dynamics\nof matter \u2013 transparently, this is consistent with the first of\nthe two specific commitments of the dynamical view discussed above. In\nthe words of Brown and Pooley (2006) (making these points about STR):\n\u201c\u2026 space-time\u2019s Minkowskian structure cannot be\ntaken to explain the Lorentz covariance of the dynamical laws. From\nour perspective \u2026 the direction of explanation goes the other\nway around. It is the Lorentz covariance of the laws that underwrites\nthe fact that the geometry of space-time is Minkowskian.\u201d\n\nOf the opposing geometrical approach to spacetime, Brown and Pooley\n(2006, p. 84) question the mechanism by which autonomous\nspacetime structure is supposed to explain or constrain the behaviour\nof material bodies. Although we will keep our attention focussed on\nthe dynamical view in this subsection, rather than upon its opponents\n(see the following subsection for more on the explanatory capacities\nof spacetime), one might, however, ask at this point: does the\ndynamical view really do better in this regard? How is it that\ndynamical symmetries are supposed to explain, or account for,\nspacetime structure? In the context of theories with fixed spacetime\nstructure, this question is answered by proponents of the dynamical\nview via an ontological reduction of spatiotemporal structure\nto symmetries of dynamical equations governing matter fields, as\nindicated in (1) above. (In fact, this \u2018reduction\u2019 is\nbetter described as a form of elimination, as we will see.)\nBut this, in turn, invites yet more questions: how, metaphysically, is\nthis ontological reduction operating? Can one in fact state dynamical\nlaws, or understand them as \u201cholding\u201d or\n\u201cgoverning\u201d, without presupposing facts about\nspacetime structure?\n\nTake, for example, Newton\u2019s laws of motion. The 1st law asserts\nthat bodies not acted upon by an external force will move with\nconstant velocity; similarly for the 2nd law and acceleration. These\nlaws seem to presuppose that these are meaningful terms, but in\nspacetime terms their meaning is given by geometric structures: for\ninstance, constant velocity in Galilean spacetime means having a\nstraight spacetime trajectory. And the problem is not restricted to\nNewtonian physics; the same point can be made regarding theories that\npresuppose the Minkowski background spacetime structure, e.g., the\nquantum field theories of the Standard Model.\n\nIt is increasingly well-appreciated that one suitable metaphysical\nprogram to which the dynamical approach can appeal here is\nHuggett\u2019s (2006) regularity relationism: see (Huggett 2009;\nPooley 2013; Stevens 2020). The idea is to consider the dynamical laws\nas regularities that systematize and describe the patterns of events\nconcerning an underlying ontology/ideology that involves or\npresupposes only very limited spatiotemporal features. To illustrate\nhow this approach might go, consider Pooley\u2019s (2013, \u00a76.3)\nproposal that the dynamical approach to STR might postulate only\nR4 topological spatiotemporal structure, which could be\n(for example) attributed to a massive scalar field. Suppose we are\ngiven a full 4D field description of such a field, in terms of some\narbitrary coordinate system. This would describe a simple\n\u2018Humean mosaic\u2019, to use David Lewis\u2019 term for\none\u2019s basic spatiotemporal and material commitments (see article\n David Lewis\n for further discussion). Now, smooth coordinate changes applied to\nsuch a description will generate distinct mathematical representations\nof that Humean mosaic, given using distinct coordinatizations of the\nfield-stuff. It might happen that, among all such representations,\nthere is a subclass of coordinate systems which are such that (i) when\nthe scalar field is described using a member of the class, it turns\nout that its values at spacetime points satisfy some simple/elegant\nmathematical equation; and moreover, (ii) the members of the class are\nrelated by a nicely-specifiable symmetry group. If this is so, then\nthe simple/elegant equation can be taken as expressing a dynamical law\nfor the world of this mosaic (understood as a statement: \u201cThere\nare frames in which \u2026\u201d), and the symmetry group of the\nlaw can be seen as capturing the derivative, not intrinsic,\nspacetime structure of the world. If the symmetry group is the\nPoincar\u00e9 group, for example, then the field behaves \u2018as\nif\u2019 it were embedded in a spacetime with Minkowski geometry. But\nall this means is that the dynamics is representationally equivalent\nto a theory with an autonomous Minkowski geometry. From the point of\nview of the dynamical approach, such a theory is merely an\ninteresting, and perhaps useful, representation of the real facts: and\nit\u2019s a mistake to take every feature of a representation to\ncorrespond to something in reality (Brown & Read 2020,\n\u00a75).\n\nEven granting that this regularity relationist understanding of the\ndynamical approach goes through, three outstanding issues for the\ndynamical approach deserve to be mentioned. First: given that the\nproponent of the view seeks to excise metrical (more generally:\ngeometrical) spacetime structure, one might ask: why stop there? Is\nthere not something unnatural about excising fixed metric structure,\nwhile taking topological structure to be primitive? Such a concern was\nraised by Norton (2008), to which two responses have been offered in\nthe literature: (I) In direct response to Norton, Pooley points out\nthat \u201cthe project was to reduce chronogeometric facts to\nsymmetries, not to recover the entire spatiotemporal nature of the\nworld from no spatiotemporal assumptions whatsoever\u201d (2013, p.\n57). (II) Menon (2019) has argued that the machinery of\n\u2018algebraic fields\u2019 can be deployed in order to reduce\ntopological structure to facts about matter, thereby, if successful,\nmeeting Norton\u2019s challenge head-on. Second: how is one to extend\nthe dynamical approach, understood as a form of Huggett\u2019s\nregularity relationism, to theories of dynamical space-time such as\nGTR? Here, the lack of spacetime symmetries in the theory has posed\nproblems for the successful implementation of any such account\n(Stevens 2014), although arguably initial progress in this regard has\nbeen made by Vassallo and Esfeld (2016). Third: to which symmetries of\nthe laws is the dynamical approach supposed to be sensitive? In the\nphilosophy of physics, it is common to draw a distinction between\n\u2018internal\u2019 and \u2018external\u2019 symmetries: examples\nof the former include U(1) gauge transformations in electromagnetism;\nexamples of the latter are coordinate transformations, such as\nGalilean boosts in Newtonian mechanics. But there are many questions\nhere, such as: (i) how, precisely, is the distinction between internal\nand external symmetries to be drawn? (ii) why should the proponent of\nthe dynamical approach stop at external symmetries? For discussion of\nthese questions, see (Dewar 2020).\n4.2 Space-time and Explanation on the Dynamical Approach\n\nWe have already seen how the dynamical approach, qua\nprogramme of ontological reduction, is supposed to play out in the\ncontext of theories with fixed spacetime structure, including both\nNewtonian theories and STR. We have also witnessed Brown and\nPooley\u2019s concerns about the ability of a substantival spacetime\nto explain facts about the behavior of matter. These concerns are\nmotivated by apparent problem cases, in which the symmetries of a\nsubstantival spacetime seem to come apart from those of the dynamical\nlaws governing matter. Such cases include: (i) Newtonian mechanics set\nin Newtonian spacetime (Read 2020a); (ii) the Jacobson-Mattingly\ntheory (Jacobson & Mattingly 2001), in which dynamical symmetries\nare a subset of spacetime symmetries, as a result of the presence of\nan additional (dynamical) symmetry-breaking vector field (Read, Brown\n& Lehmkuhl 2018).\n\nIt is not obvious that these critiques are fair to proponents of a\ngeometrical view. One might take their position not to be that a\ncertain piece of geometrical structure (e.g., the Minkowski metric of\nSTR) invariably constrains matter, whenever it is present in a theory,\nto manifest its symmetries (a claim which seems to be false, in light\nof the above cases). Instead, one might take their claim to be\nconditional: if one has matter which couples to this piece of\ngeometrical structure in such-and-such a way, then that\ngeometrical structure can explain why the laws have the such-and-such\nsymmetries. In (Read, 2020a), the (arguably) straw man version of a\ngeometrical view critiqued by Brown and Pooley is dubbed the\n\u2018unqualified geometrical approach\u2019, in contrast with this\nmore nuanced and defensible version of the view, which is dubbed the\n\u2018qualified geometrical approach\u2019. (Brown might still\nreject the qualified geometrical approach on the grounds that it makes\nexplanatory appeal to objects which violate the \u2018action-reaction\nprinciple\u2019, which states that every entity physical should both\nact on, and react to, other physical entities (Brown 2005, p. 140). If\nso, that this is the real reason for the rejection deserves to be\nflagged; moreover, it remains open whether the objection succeeds\nagainst the non-substantivalist versions of the geometrical view which\nare discussed below.)\n\nFocussing on the qualified geometrical approach, there are also\nquestions regarding the particular sense in which spacetime structure\ncan be said to be explanatory of dynamical symmetries. One notion of\nexplanation discussed in this literature is that of a\n\u2018constructive explanation\u2019.This is derivative on\nEinstein\u2019s distinction between \u2018principle theories\u2019\nand \u2018constructive theories\u2019 (Einstein 1919): for detailed\ndiscussion, see (Brown 2005, \u00a75.2). In brief, a constructive\nexplanation is one in which phenomenological effects are explained by\nreference to real (but possibly unobservable) physical bodies. (For\nfurther discussion of how to understand constructive theories and\nexplanations, see (Frisch 2011).) With the idea of a constructive\nexplanation in mind, one can say this: if a proponent of a geometrical\nview hypostatizes spacetime, then they can give constructive\nexplanations of certain physical effects by appeal to that spacetime\nstructure; otherwise, they cannot. That said, even if one does not\nhypostatise spacetime, and so concedes that spacetime cannot offer\nconstructive explanations of the behaviour of matter, it is not\nobvious that spacetime cannot still facilitate other kinds of\nexplanation. For discussions of these issues, see (Acu\u00f1a 2016;\nDorato & Felline 2010; Frisch 2011; Read 2020b).\n4.3 The Dynamical Approach and General Relativity\n\nAs we have already seen in section 2, spacetime in GTR is dynamical.\nThis leads Brown to maintain that there is no substantial conceptual\ndistinction between the metric field of GTR and matter fields:\n\u201cGravity is different from the other interactions, but this\ndoesn\u2019t mean that it is categorically distinct from,\nsay, the electromagnetic field\u201d (Brown 2005, p. 159). In this\nsense, Brown is a relationist about GTR, and counts authors such as\n(Rovelli, 1997) as allies. However, much caution is needed concerning\nthis use of the term \u2018relationism\u2019. In particular, in the\ncontext of GTR \u2013 and in significant contrast with his approach\nto theories such as STR \u2013 Brown makes no claim that the metric\nfield should be ontologically reduced to properties of (the laws\ngoverning) matter fields; rather, in light of its dynamical status,\nthe metric field of GTR \u201ccries out for reification\u201d\n(Brown, personal communication). Indeed, even if Brown did not\nmaintain this, we have already registered above that there are\ntechnical problems with attempting to apply the dynamical approach,\nunderstood as a version of regularity relationism, to theories such as\nGTR.\n\nIn light of these issues, when considering GTR, Brown (2005, ch. 9)\nfocuses entirely on thesis (2), presented in the introduction to this\nsection: no piece of geometrical structure has its\n\u2018chronogeometric significance\u2019 of necessity \u2013 that\nis, no piece of geometrical structure is necessarily surveyed by\nphysical bodies; rather, in order to ascertain whether such is the\ncase, one must pay detailed attention to the dynamics of the matter\nfields constituting those physical bodies. This, indeed, should\nalready be evident in light of the examples discussed in the previous\nsubsection, such as the Jacobson-Mattingly theory, in which matter\ndoes not \u2018advert\u2019 to the designated piece of spacetime\nstructure.\n\nThis thesis (2) should be uncontroversial. There are, however,\nconcerns that the thesis is so uncontroversial that any\ndistinction between the dynamical approach and its opponents in the\ncontext of theories such as GTR (and, in particular, without the\nregularity relationist approach to ontological reduction applied in\nthe case of theories with fixed spacetime structure) has been effaced\n(Pooley 2013; Read 2020a). Even setting this aside, there are also\ndisagreements regarding how exactly a piece of structure in a given\ntheory is to acquire its \u2018chronogeometric\nsignificance\u2019 \u2013 that is, for the intervals which it\ndetermines to be accessible operationally to physical bodies and\nmeasuring devices. Brown\u2019s preferred answer to this question\n(Brown 2005, ch. 9) makes appeal to the \u2018strong equivalence\nprinciple\u2019. There are a great many subtleties and technical\ndifficulties which need to be overcome in order to attain a clear\nunderstanding of this principle (Read, Brown & Lehmkuhl 2018;\nWeatherall 2020), but, roughly speaking, it states that, in local\nregions in GTR, matter fields can be understood to obey Lorentz\ncovariant dynamical equations, just as in STR (we have already seen\nsomething of this in section 2 above). Absent further details,\npace Brown, it is not clear why this is sufficient to secure\nthe \u2018chronogeometric significance\u2019 of the metric field in\nGTR. Even setting this aside, there are questions regarding whether\nthe strong equivalence principle is necessary for\nchronogeometric significance. For example, an alternative approach\nmight make appeal to the results of (Ehlers, Pirani & Schild,\n1972), in which the authors demonstrate that the trajectories of\nmassive and massless bodies are sufficient to reconstruct the metric\nfield in GTR (cf. (Malament 2012, \u00a72.1)). These issues are raised\nin (Read 2020a), but much work remains to be done in uncovering the\nfull range of ways in which a given piece of structure might come to\nhave chronogeometric significance.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis entry, and its companion on\n classical theories,\n have been concerned with tracing the history and philosophy of\n\u2018absolute\u2019 and \u2018relative\u2019 theories of space\nand motion. Along the way we have been at pains to introduce some\nclear terminology for various different concepts (e.g.,\n\u2018true\u2019 motion, \u2018substantivalism\u2019,\n\u2018absolute space\u2019), but what we have not really done is say\nwhat the difference between absolute and relative space and\nmotion is: just what is at stake? Rynasiewicz (2000) argued that there\nsimply are no constant issues running through the history from\nantiquity through general relativity theory; that there is no stable\nmeaning for either \u2018absolute motion\u2019 or \u2018relative\nmotion\u2019 (or \u2018substantival space\u2019 vs\n\u2018relational space\u2019). While we agree to a certain extent,\nwe think that nevertheless there are a series of issues that have\nmotivated thinkers again and again. Rynasiewicz is probably right that\nthe issues cannot be expressed in formally precise terms, but that\ndoes not mean that there are no looser philosophical affinities that\nshed useful light on the history and on current theorizing.\n\nOur discussion has revealed several different issues, of which we will\nhighlight three as components of the \u2018absolute-relative\ndebate\u2019. (i) There is the question of whether all motions and\nall possible descriptions of motions are equal, or whether some are\n\u2018real\u2019 \u2013 what we have called, in Seventeenth Century\nparlance, \u2018true\u2019. There is a natural temptation for those\nwho hold that there is \u2018nothing but the relative positions and\nmotions between bodies\u2019 to add \u2018and all such motions are\nequal\u2019, thus denying the existence of true motion. However,\narguably \u2013 perhaps surprisingly \u2013 no one we have discussed\nhas unreservedly held this view (at least not consistently): Descartes\nconsidered motion \u2018properly speaking\u2019 to be privileged,\nLeibniz introduced \u2018active force\u2019 to ground motion\n(arguably in his mechanics as well as metaphysically), and\nMach\u2019s view seems to be that the distribution of matter in the\nuniverse determines a preferred standard of inertial motion. In\ngeneral relativity there is a well-defined distinction between\ninertial and accelerated motion, given by the spacetime metric, but\nEinstein initially hoped that the metric itself would be determined in\nturn by relative locations and motions of the matter distribution in\nspacetime.\n\nThat is, relationists can allow \u2018true\u2019 motions if they\noffer an analysis of them in terms of the relations between bodies.\nGiven this logical point, we are led to the second question: (ii) is\ntrue motion definable in terms of relations or not? (And if one hopes\nto give an affirmative answer, what kinds of relations are acceptable\nto use in the reductive definition?) It seems reasonable to call this\nthe issue of whether motion is absolute or relative.\nDescartes and Mach were relationists about motion in this sense, while\nNewton was an absolutist. In the case of Einstein and GTR we linked\nrelational motion to the satisfaction of Mach\u2019s Principle, just\nas Einstein did in the early years of the theory. Despite some\npromising features displayed by GTR, and certain of its models, we saw\nthat Mach\u2019s Principle is certainly not fully satisfied in GTR as\na whole. We also noted that in the absence of absolute simultaneity,\nit becomes an open question what relations are to be permitted in the\ndefinition (or supervience base) \u2013 spacetime interval relations?\nInstantaneous spatial distances and velocities on a 3-d hypersurface?\nThe shape dynamics program comes at this question from a new\nperspective, starting with momentary slices of space (with or without\nmatter contents) which are given a strongly relational \u2013 as\nopposed to absolute \u2013 interpretation. However, we argued that it\nultimately remains unclear whether this approach vindicates\nMach\u2019s Principle.\n\nThe final issue we have discussed in this article is that of (iii)\nwhether spacetime structures are substantial entities in their own\nright, metaphysically speaking not grounded on facts about dynamical\nlaws, or whether instead it is best to think of the reality of\nspacetime structures as dependent upon, and explained by, facts about\nthe world\u2019s dynamical laws, as advocates of the dynamical\napproach maintain. The debate here is not the same as that between\nclassical relationism and substantivalism, although there are clear\naffinities between the dynamical approach and classical relationism.\nWe explored how this issue takes quite different forms in the context\nof special relativistic (Lorentz covariant) physical theories and in\nthe context of general relativistic theories.\n",
