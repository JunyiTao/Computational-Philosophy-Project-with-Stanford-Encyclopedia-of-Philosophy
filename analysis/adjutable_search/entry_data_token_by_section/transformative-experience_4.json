    "main_text": "Varieties of Transformative Experience || Social Identity\n1.4 Social Identity\n\nAll of us inhabit a place in society that\u2019s determined in part\nby race, gender, sexual orientation, ability, religion, country of\norigin, education, socioeconomic status, political affiliation, and\nmuch more. Due to contingent but very real injustices, our place in\nsociety shapes our experiences. Sometimes, it\u2019s possible to\nchange our place in society (McKinnon 2015 discusses gender\ntransitions and Barnes 2015 offers the fictional case of Pip from\nGreat Expectations), and when we do so, that change is\ntransformative. But the way in which these social changes are\ntransformative underlines some troubling features these social divides\nhave created. First, just as, for instance, Pip, cannot explain to his\npast self what social elevation is like, it is generally extremely\ndifficult for people in one social group to communicate what it is\nlike to be a member of that group to someone who is outside of it.\nThis partially explains the phenomenon of situated knowledge and also\ngives rise to the possibility of testimonial epistemic injustice (see,\ne.g., Fricker 2007). Hermeneutical issues also arise. People\u2019s\nself-conceptions aren\u2019t developed in a vacuum, and shared norms\nand concepts contribute to the way in which one\u2019s\nself-conception can develop, thus influencing the ways in which one\ncan transform. For instance, \u201cbrave inspiration\u201d is a\nreadily available self-conception for disabled people while\n\u201cthriving person in an unconventional body\u201d is\nnot\u2014and this is an unjust state of affairs (Barnes 2015). Social\nidentities and structures contribute an ethically rich dimension to\nthe conversation on transformative experience.\n",
