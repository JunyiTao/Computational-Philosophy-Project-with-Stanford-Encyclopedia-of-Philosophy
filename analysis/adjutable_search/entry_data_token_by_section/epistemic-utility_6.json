    "main_text": "Epistemic Utility Arguments concerning Outright Beliefs || Dominance and Almost Lockean Completeness\n4.3 Dominance and Almost Lockean Completeness\n\nDaniel Rothschild (2021) gives an argument from\n Dominance\n to a norm he calls Almost Lockean Completeness for Belief Sets at a\nthreshold, which says:\n\n\nAlmost Lockean Completeness for Belief Sets with threshold\n\\(t\\) Rationality requires that there there is some\nprobabilistic credence function such that your beliefs satisfy the\nLockean Thesis with threshold \\(t\\) with respect to that credence\nfunction.\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Lockean Thesis and Almost Lockean\nCompleteness for Belief Sets are quite different norms. The first\ngoverns a relationship between your credences and your beliefs; the\nsecond does not even assume you have any credences, and instead\ngoverns only your beliefs\u2014it says that your beliefs should be\nas they would be if you were to have credences and they were\nto be related to your beliefs as the Lockean Thesis says they should\nbe.\n\nHere is Rothschild\u2019s argument. Above, we assumed that the\nepistemic utilities of true beliefs in different propositions are the\nsame, and similarly for false beliefs. But we might score attitudes to\ndifferent propositions differently: \\(R_X\\) for a true belief in\n\\(X\\), \\(-W_X\\) for a false belief in \\(X\\); \\(R_Y\\) for a true belief\nin \\(Y\\), \\(-W_Y\\) for a false belief in \\(Y\\); and so on. For\ninstance, if \\(X\\) concerns the correct fundamental theory of physics,\nI might set \\(R_X = 10, W_X = 20\\), while if \\(Y\\) concerns the number\nof blades of grass in Hyde Park, I might set \\(R_Y = 1, W_Y = 2\\).\nThis might reflect the greater importance of \\(X\\) than \\(Y\\). Now, if\n\\(\\frac{W_X}{R_X} = \\frac{W_Y}{R_Y}\\), for any two propositions \\(X,\nY\\), we say that the epistemic utilities have uniform ratio.\nAnd in that case the Lockean threshold is the same for each\nproposition if we maximize expected utility. But what about\n Dominance?\n Rothschild proves the following result:\n\n\nDominance Theorem for Almost Lockean Completeness for Belief\nSets (Rothschild 2021) A belief set satisfies Almost Lockean\nCompleteness iff there is no set of epistemic utilities with uniform\nratio under which the pair is strongly dominated.\n\n\nI sketch the proof in the\n supplementary materials.\n\nOne issue with this argument: To extract\n Almost Lockean Completeness\n from the\n Dominance Theorem for Almost Lockean Completeness,\n a decision-theoretic norm is needed. It would say that it\u2019s\nirrational to be dominated relative to any set of epistemic\nutilities that have uniform ratio. But this norm is not compelling.\nWhy care about being dominated relative to epistemic utilities that\nare not your own?\n",
