    "main_text": "Synchronic Norms (I): Requirements of Coherence || Countable Additivity\n3.2 Countable Additivity\n\nProbabilism, as stated in\n section 2,\n implies Finite Additivity, the norm that one\u2019s credence in the\ndisjunction of two incompatible disjuncts ought to be equal to the sum\nof the credences in those two disjuncts. Finite Additivity can be\nnaturally strengthened as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCountable Additivity. It ought to be that, for any\npropositions \\(A_1,\\) \\(A_2,\\)\u2026, \\(A_n,\\)\u2026 that are\nmutually exclusive, if one has credences in those propositions and in\ntheir disjunction \\(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\), then one\u2019s\ncredence function \\(\\Cr\\) satisfies the following formula:\n\n\\[\\Cr\\left( \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\right) = \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\Cr\\left(A_n\\right).\\]\n \n\n\n\nCountable Additivity has extensive applications, both in statistics\nand in philosophy of science; for a concise summary and relevant\nreferences, see J. Williamson (1999: sec. 3).\n\nAlthough Countable Additivity is a natural strengthening of Finite\nAdditivity, the former is much more controversial. De Finetti (1970\n[1974]) proposes a counterexample:\n\n\nExample (Infinite Lottery). There is a fair\nlottery with a countable infinity of tickets. Since it is fair, there\nis one and only one winning ticket, and all tickets are equally likely\nto win. For an agent taking all those for granted (i.e., with full\ncredence), what should be her credence in the proposition \\(A_n\\) that\nthe n-th ticket will win?\n\n\n\nThe answer seems to be 0. To see why, note that all those propositions\n\\(A_n\\) should be assigned equal credences \\(c\\), by the fairness of\nthe lottery. Then it is not hard to show that, in order to satisfy\nProbabilism, a positive \\(c\\) is too high and a negative \\(c\\) is too\n low.[4]\n So, by Probabilism, the only alternative is \\(c = 0\\). But this\nresult violates Countable Additivity: by the fairness of the lottery,\nthe left side is \n\\[\\Cr\\left(\\bigcup_{n = 1}^{\\infty} A_n\\right) = 1,\\]\n\n\nbut the right side is \n\\[\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\Cr\\left(A_n\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c = 0.\\]\n\n\nDe Finetti thus concludes that this is a counterexample to Countable\nAdditivity. For closely related worries about Countable Additivity,\nsee Kelly (1996: ch. 13) and Seidenfeld (2001). Also see Bartha (2004:\nsec. 3) for discussions and further references.\n\nDespite the above controversy, attempts have been made to argue for\nCountable Additivity, partly because of the interest in saving its\nextensive applications. For example, J. Williamson (1999) defends the\nidea that there is a good Dutch Book argument for Countable Additivity\neven though the Dutch Book involved has to contain a countable\ninfinity of bets and the agent involved has to be able to accept or\nreject that many bets. Easwaran (2013) provides further defense of the\nDutch Book argument for Countable Additivity (and another argument for\nit). The above two authors also argue that the Infinite Lottery Case\nonly appears to be a counterexample to Countable Additivity and can be\nexplained away.\n\nIt is debatable whether we really need to defend Countable Additivity\nin order to save its extensive applications. Bartha (2004) thinks that\nthe answer is negative. He argues that, even if Countable Additivity\nis abandoned due to the Infinite Lottery Case, this poses no serious\nthreat to its extensive applications.\n\n\n",
