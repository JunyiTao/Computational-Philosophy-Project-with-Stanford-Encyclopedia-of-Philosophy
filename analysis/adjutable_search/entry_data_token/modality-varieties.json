Such claims can come in many forms. Consider:\n\nNo one can be both a bachelor and married. (\u2018Bachelor\u2019\nmeans \u2018unmarried man\u2019.)\nYou could not have been born of different parents.\n(Someone born of different parents wouldn\u2019t be you.)\nNothing can travel faster than light. (It\u2019s a law of\nnature.)\nOne cannot get from London to New York in less than one hour.\n(Planes that fast haven\u2019t been built yet.)\nYou cannot leave the palace. (The doors are locked.)\nYou cannot promise to come and then stay at home. (It\u2019s\nwrong.)\nYou cannot start a job application cover letter with \u201chey\nguys\u201d. (It\u2019s just not done.) \nYou cannot castle if your king is in check. (It\u2019s against\nthe rules.)\nYou cannot deduct your holidays from your taxes. (It\u2019s\nagainst the law.)\nFred cannot be the killer. (The evidence shows that he\u2019s\ninnocent.)\n\n\nEach of these claims appears to have a true reading. But it also seems\nthat \u2018cannot\u2019 needs to be interpreted in different ways to\nmake the different sentences true. For one thing, we can, in the same\nbreath, accept a modal claim in one of the senses illustrated by\n(1)\u2013(10) while rejecting it in another one of these senses, as\nin the following dialogue:\n\nCaesar:\n You\u2019re lucky that I\u2019m still here. The doors were\nunlocked. I could have left the palace.\nCleopatra:\n True. But then again, you couldn\u2019t have left the\npalace. That would have been wrong, given that you promised to meet me\nhere.\n\n\nMoreover, the modal claims (1)\u2013(10) appear to be true for\ncompletely different reasons. For example, it may be held that the\ntruth of (1) is due to the meanings of its constituent expressions;\nthat (2) holds because it lies in your nature to be born of your\nactual parents; that (3) is true because the laws of nature preclude\nsuperluminal motion; that (4) holds because of technological\nlimitations; that (5) owes its truth to the presence of insurmountable\npractical obstacles; that (6)\u2013(9) are made true by the demands\nof morality, etiquette, the rules of chess, and the law respectively;\nand that (10) holds because the known facts prove Fred\u2019s\ninnocence.\n\nIt is one of the tasks of a philosophical theory of modality to give a\nsystematic and unified account of this multiplicity of modal concepts.\nThis article discusses a few of the main issues that need to be\naddressed by anyone pursuing this goal. Sections 1 and 2 concern the\nquestion of what fundamental categories of modal notions there are.\nThe focus will be on two contemporary debates: whether there are\nseparate forms of modality that are tied to the epistemic and the\nmetaphysical domains (section 1), and whether there is a special kind\nof necessity associated with the laws of nature (section 2). Section 3\ndiscusses questions about the relations between different notions of\nnecessity. Can some of them be reduced to other, more fundamental\nones? If so, which concepts of necessity are the most fundamental\nones? And if there are several fundamental kinds of necessity, what do\nthey have in common that makes them all kinds of necessity?\n", "toc": [{"#EpiMetMod": "1.

Epistemic and Metaphysical Modality\n\nThere are many ways the world could have been. You could have gotten\nup later today. Your parents could have failed to meet, so that you\nwere never born. Life could never have developed on earth. The history\nof the universe could even have been completely different from the\nbeginning. And many philosophers believe that the laws of nature could\nhave been different as well (although that has been denied, as\ndiscussed in\n section 2).\n Maximally specific ways the world could have been are commonly called\n\u2018possible worlds.\u2019 The apparatus of possible worlds allows\nus to introduce a set of modal notions: a proposition is necessary\njust in case it is true in all possible worlds, a proposition is\npossible just in case it is true in some possible worlds, and it is\ncontingent just in case it is true in some but not all possible\nworlds. A sentence is necessary (possible, contingent) just\nin case it expresses a necessary (possible, contingent)\nproposition.\n\nThe modal notions considered in the last paragraph are not obviously\nepistemological. On the face it, we are not reporting a fact about\nwhat is or can be known or believed by anyone when we say that life\ncould have failed to develop. But there is also a family of modal\nconcepts that are clearly epistemological. These are the notions we\nemploy when we say things like \u2018Fred must have stolen\nthe book (the evidence shows conclusively that he did it),\u2019 or\n\u2018Mary cannot be in London (she would have called\nme).\u2019 These modal utterances seem to make claims about what the\navailable evidence shows, or about which scenarios can be ruled out on\nthe basis of the evidence. More formally, we can say that a\nproposition \\(P\\) is epistemically necessary for an agent A\njust in case the empirical evidence \\(A\\) possesses and ideal\nreasoning (i.e., reasoning unrestricted by cognitive limitations) are\nsufficient to rule out \\({\\sim}P\\). This notion of epistemic necessity\nis agent-relative: one and the same claim can be epistemically\nnecessary for one agent, but not for another agent with less empirical\nevidence. We obtain a notion of epistemic necessity of particular\nphilosophical interest by focusing on a limiting case, namely that of\na possible agent with no empirical evidence\n whatsoever.[1]\n A proposition \\(P\\) is epistemically necessary for such an agent just\nin case ideal reasoning alone, unaided by empirical evidence, is\nsufficient to rule out \\({\\sim}P\\). A proposition that meets this\ncondition can be called a priori in at least one sense of\nthis term, or we can call it simply epistemically necessary\n(without relativization to an agent). Propositions that are not a\npriori are called a\n posteriori.[2]\n\nIt is an important and controversial question whether the necessary\npropositions are all and only the epistemically necessary (a\npriori) ones, or whether the extensions of the two concepts can\ncome apart. One possible reason for thinking that the notions are\ncoextensive derives from a very natural picture of information and\ninquiry. On this picture, all information about the world is\ninformation about which of all possible worlds is realized (i.e.,\nabout where in the space of all possible worlds the actual world is\nlocated). My total information about the world can be identified with\nthe set of possible worlds that I cannot rule out on the basis of my\nempirical evidence and ideal reasoning. As I gather more and more\nempirical evidence, I can progressively narrow down the range of\npossibilities. Suppose, for example, that I am ignorant of the current\nweather conditions. The worlds compatible with my evidence include\nsome where the weather is good and others where it is bad. A look out\nof the window at the rain provides information about the matter. I can\nnow narrow down the set of possibilities by excluding all possible\nworlds with fine weather. On this account, a proposition \\(P\\) is\nepistemically necessary for \\(A\\) just in case \\(P\\) is true\nin all possible worlds that cannot be ruled out on the basis of\n\\(A\\)\u2019s empirical evidence and ideal reasoning. \\(P\\) is a\npriori just in case it is epistemically necessary for a possible\nagent who has no empirical evidence. Since such an agent cannot rule\nout any possible worlds, a proposition is a priori just in\ncase it is true in all possible worlds. In other words, the a\npriori propositions are all and only the necessary\n propositions.[3]\n\nThis approach is often combined with a certain account of semantic\ncontent. One of the main purposes of language is to transmit\ninformation about the world. Where \\(P\\) is any sentence used for that\npurpose (roughly speaking, a declarative sentence), it seems natural\nto think of \\(P\\)\u2019s content (the proposition expressed by it) as\nthe information that is semantically encoded in it. Combining this\nwith the foregoing account of information, we can think of the content\nof a sentence as a set of possible worlds (namely, the set containing\njust those worlds of which the sentence is true) or, equivalently, as\na function from worlds to truth-values.\n\nThis picture connects the modal, epistemic and semantic realms in a\nsimple and elegant way, and various versions of it have informed the\nwork of numerous contemporary philosophers (including David Lewis,\nRobert Stalnaker, David Chalmers, and Frank Jackson). However, the\napproach has come under pressure from data to be considered in the\nnext section.\n1.1 The Data\n\nThe idea that all and only the a priori truths are necessary\nwas thrown into serious doubt by the work of philosophers including\nHilary Putnam (1972) and Saul Kripke (1980). Kripke distinguishes\nbetween two different kinds of singular terms, rigid and\nnon-rigid ones. A so-called rigid designator is an\nexpression that singles out the same thing in all possible worlds.\nKripke argues that ordinary proper names like \u2018Al Gore\u2019\nare rigid. We can use this name to describe how things actually are,\ne.g., by saying \u2018Al Gore became vice president in 1993.\u2019\nIn such cases, the name picks out Al Gore. But we can equally use the\nname to describe how things stand in other possible worlds, e.g., by\nsaying, \u2018If Bill Clinton had chosen a different running mate, Al\nGore would not have become vice president.\u2019 In this case, we are\ntalking about a non-actualized possibility, and we use the name\n\u2018Al Gore\u2019 to describe this possibility. Moreover, we use\nthe name to say something about how things stand with Al Gore in that\npossibility. In general, when we use the name to describe any possible\nworld, we use it to talk about the same person, Al Gore. Other\nexamples of rigid designators include indexical expressions like the\nfirst-person pronoun \u2018I,\u2019 or the expression\n\u2018now.\u2019 When you use the term \u2018I\u2019 to describe\nany possible world, you are always picking out the same thing:\nyourself. Natural kind terms like \u2018water\u2019 and\n\u2018gold\u2019 can also be regarded as rigid terms, as they single\nout the same kinds in every possible world. Non-rigid singular term,\nby contrast, pick out different entities in different possible\nscenarios. The paradigmatic examples of non-rigid terms are\ndescriptions that are satisfied by different objects in different\npossible worlds. For example, \u2018the most annoying person in the\nhistory of the world\u2019 may pick out Fred in the actual world,\nwhile picking out Cleopatra in some other possible worlds.\n\nSingular terms can be introduced into the language with the help of\ndescriptions. There are two ways in which that can be done. On the one\nhand, we can stipulate that the singular term is to be\nsynonymous with the description, for example by laying down\nthat \u2018the morning star\u2019 is to mean the same as \u2018the\nlast celestial body to be seen in the morning.\u2019 When we use the\nexpression to describe another possible world, the new expression will\nsingle out whatever celestial body is the last one that can be seen in\nthe morning in that world. Since different things meet this condition\nin different worlds, the expression is non-rigid. On the other hand,\nwe may introduce a term with the stipulation that it is to be a rigid\ndesignator referring to whatever object actually satisfies\nthe description. For instance, we may lay it down that\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 is to refer rigidly to the object that is\nactually the last celestial body visible in the morning. Since that\nobject is Venus, the name will pick out Venus, not only when we use it\nto describe the actual world, but also when we (in the actual world)\nuse it to describe other possible worlds, including worlds where Venus\nis not the last planet visible in the morning.When a description is\nused to introduce a singular term in the second way, it merely serves\nto fix the reference of the term, but is not synonymous with it.\n\nNow consider a true identity statement that involves two rigid\ndesignators, such as\n\n(1)\n Mark Twain (if he\nexists) is Samuel Clemens.\n\n\nSince \u2018Mark Twain\u2019 and \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 pick\nout the same entity in every possible world where they pick out\nanything, this identity statement is a necessary truth. (Note that the\nstatement is conditionalized on Mark Twain\u2019s existence, which\nmakes it possible to avoid the question whether (1) is true in worlds\nwhere the two names pick out nothing.) But it is far from immediately\nobvious that (1) expresses something that can be known a\npriori. At least on the face of it, we may think that someone who\nknows her neighbor by the name of \u2018Samuel Clemens,\u2019 who\nhas read several stories by an author named \u2018Mark Twain\u2019\nand who fails to realize that her neighbor and the author are\nidentical may not know that which is expressed by (1). Moreover, it\nmay seem that her ignorance is irremediable by reasoning alone, that\nshe requires empirical evidence to come to know that which is stated\nby (1).\n\nAnother type of apparent counterexample to the thesis that all and\nonly the a priori truths are necessary concerns sentences\nlike\n\n(2)\n If gold exists, then it has atomic number 79.\n\n\nIt seems plausible that it is an essential property of gold to have\natomic number 79: gold could not have (existed but) failed to have\nthat property. (A substance in another possible world that fails to\nhave atomic number 79 simply isn\u2019t gold, no matter how similar\nit may otherwise be to the gold of the actual world.) And yet it seems\nclear that it can only be known empirically that gold has that atomic\nnumber. So, while (2) is a necessary truth, what it says cannot be\nknown a priori. For another illustration of this phenomenon,\nsuppose that I point to the wooden desk in my office and say:\n\n(3)\n If this desk exists, it is made of wood.\n\n\nIt is arguably essential to this desk to be made of wood. A desk in\nanother possible world that isn\u2019t wooden simply can\u2019t be\nthis desk, no matter how similar it may otherwise be to my\ndesk. But it seems that we need empirical evidence to know that the\ndesk is made of wood. So, (3) is another apparent example of a\nnecessary a posteriori truth.\n\nJust as Kripke claims that some truths are necessary without being\na priori, he argues that a truth can be a priori\nwithout being necessary. To use an example of Gareth Evans\u2019s\n(1982), suppose that I introduce the term \u2018Julius\u2019 by\nstipulating that it is to refer rigidly to the person who is in fact\nthe inventor of the zip (if such a person exists). Then it may appear\nthat I don\u2019t need further empirical evidence to know that\n\n(4)\n If Julius exists, then Julius is the inventor of the zip.\n\n\nBut (4) does not seem to be a necessary truth. After all, Julius could\nhave become a salesperson rather than an inventor.\n\nAccording to Kripke, our initial surprise at the divergent extensions\nof a prioricity and necessity should be mitigated on reflection. A\nprioricity (epistemic necessity) is an epistemological\nnotion: it has to do with what can be known. That is not true of the\nconcept of necessity. (2) is necessary because the atomic number of\ngold is an essential feature of it, and on the face of it, that has\nnothing to do with what is known or believed by anyone. This kind of\nnecessity is a metaphysical notion, and we may use the term\n\u2018metaphysical necessity\u2019 to distinguish it more clearly\nfrom epistemic necessity.\n\nKripke\u2019s examples are not the only ones that could be appealed\nto in order to shed doubt on the coextensiveness of necessity and a\nprioricity. Some other problematic cases are listed below (Chalmers\n2002a; cp. Chalmers 2012, ch. 6).\n\nMathematical truths. It is common to hold that all\nmathematical truths are necessary. But on the face of it, there is no\nguarantee that all mathematical truths are knowable a priori\n(or knowable in any way at all). For example, either the continuum\nhypothesis or its negation is true, and whichever of these claims is\ntrue is also necessary. But for all we know, there is no way for us to\nknow that that proposition is true.\nLaws of nature. Some necessitarians about the natural\nlaws (see\n section 2)\n believe that the laws hold in all metaphysically possible worlds. But\nthey are not a priori truths.\nMetaphysical principles. It is often believed that many\nmetaphysical theses are necessary if true, e.g., theses about the\nnature of properties (e.g., about whether they are universals, sets or\ntropes) or ontological principles like the principle of unrestricted\nmereological composition (which says that for any things there is\nsomething that is their sum). But it is not obvious that all truths of\nthis kind are a priori. (For discussion, see Chalmers 2012,\n\u00a7\u00a76.4\u20136.5; Schaffer 2017.)\nPrinciples linking the physical and the mental. Some\nphilosophers hold that all truths about the mental are metaphysically\nnecessitated by the physical truths, but deny that it is possible to\nderive the mental truths from the physical ones by a priori\nreasoning (see Hill & McLaughlin 1999; Yablo 1999; Loar 1999; and\nChalmers 1999 for discussion). On that account, some of the\nconditionals that link physical and mental claims are metaphysically\nnecessary but not a priori.\n\n\nThese examples are controversial. For any given mathematical claim\nwhose truth-value is unknown, one could hold that it is only our\ncognitive limitations that have prevented us from establishing or\nrefuting the statement, and that the question could be decided by\nideal reasoning (so that the truth of the matter is a\npriori). Alternatively, it may be held that the truth-value of\nthe mathematical statement is indeterminate. (Perhaps our practices do\nnot completely determine the references of all the terms used in the\nmathematical claim). The same two options are available in the case of\nmetaphysical principles. Alternatively, one may argue that the\nrelevant metaphysical theses are merely contingent (see, e.g., Cameron\n2007). Necessitarianism about the natural laws is highly controversial\nand may simply be denied. And in response to (iv), one may deny that\nthe physical truths metaphysically necessitate the mental truths\n(Chalmers 1996), or one may hold that the mental truths can be derived\nfrom the physical ones by a priori reasoning (Jackson\n1998).\n\nPhilosophers have paid more attention to the examples given by Kripke\nthan to other possible cases of the necessary a posteriori,\nand for that reason the discussion in the rest of this section will\nmostly focus on Kripke\u2019s cases. Two strategies for explaining\nthese examples can be distinguished. Dualists about metaphysical and\nepistemic modality (dualists, for short) hold that the phenomena\nreflect a deep and fundamental distinction between two kinds of\nmodality. Monists, by contrast, believe that all the data can\nultimately be explained by appeal to a single kind of modality. They\nmay agree that there are cases in which a single sentence is, in some\nsense, both necessary and a posteriori, or both contingent\nand a priori. But they insist that there is no similar\ndistinction at the level of worlds or propositions. Rather, the\nphenomenon arises because a single sentence can be associated with two\ndifferent propositions, one that is necessary and another that is\ncontingent.\n1.2 Dualism\n\nDualists distinguish between two concepts of propositional necessity,\nmetaphysically necessity and epistemic necessity.\nThe two notions are not coextensive. At least some of the sentences in\nKripke\u2019s examples express propositions that possess the one kind\nof necessity but not the\n other.[4]\n\nOnce the existence of a distinctively metaphysical form of\npropositional necessity is accepted, it is natural to wonder whether\nit is possible to say more about its nature. Kit Fine (1994) offers an\naccount of it that appeals to the traditional distinction between\nthose properties of a thing that it possesses by its very nature and\nthose that it has merely accidentally. For example, it lies in the\nnature of water to be composed of hydrogen and oxygen\u2014being\ncomposed in this way is part of what it is to be water\u2014but it is\nmerely accidental to water that we use it to brush our teeth. A\nproposition is metaphysically necessary just in case it is true in\nvirtue of the natures of things. (Also see Kment 2014, chs. 6\u20137,\nand Ditter 2020.) Other philosophers (Rayo 2013, \u00a72.2.1, ch.\n5; Dorr 2016) have discussed the idea that metaphysical necessity can\nbe explained in terms of the idiom \u201cTo be \\(F\\) is to be\n\\(G\\)\u201d (as in \u201cTo be water is to be\nH2O\u201d). Yet another account ties the metaphysical\nnotion of necessity constitutively to causation and explanation (Kment\n2006a,b, 2014, 2015a; also see the exchange between Lange 2015 and\nKment 2015b).\n\nDualism requires us to dismantle the picture of inquiry, information\nand content sketched in the introduction to\n section 1.\n Note that it is natural for a dualist to distinguish the space of\nmetaphysically possible worlds from the space of\nepistemically possible worlds, i.e., from the space of\n(maximally specific) ways the world might be that cannot be ruled out\non the basis of ideal reasoning alone, without empirical evidence\n(Soames 2005, 2011). The range of epistemically possible worlds\noutstrips the range of metaphysically possible worlds: there are some\nways the world couldn\u2019t have been, but which cannot be ruled by\nideal reasoning alone. For example, there is no metaphysically\npossible world where gold has atomic number 78. But prior to carrying\nout the right chemical investigations, we don\u2019t have enough\nevidence to exclude all scenarios where gold has that atomic number,\nso some worlds where gold has atomic number 78 are epistemically\npossible. Empirical evidence is not used only to rule out\n(metaphysical) possibilities, but is sometimes needed to rule out\nmetaphysical impossibilities that are epistemically possible.\nConsequently, we cannot in general identify information with sets of\nmetaphysically possible worlds, since we need to distinguish between\nstates of information in which the available evidence rules out the\nsame metaphysically possible worlds but different metaphysically\nimpossible worlds. By the same token, the information encoded in a\nsentence cannot in general be identified with a set of metaphysically\npossible worlds, since two sentences may be true in all the same\nmetaphysically possible worlds, but not in all the same epistemically\npossible worlds. If we wanted to identify information and sentential\ncontents with sets of worlds, it would seem more promising to use sets\nof epistemically possible worlds. But the dualist may instead reject\nthe possible-worlds account of information and propositions altogether\n(see, e.g., Soames 1987, 2003, 395f.).\n1.3 Monism\n\nAs mentioned above, monists explain the data described by Kripke by\nholding that the sentences that figure in Kripke\u2019s examples are\nassociated with two different propositions, one that is necessary and\nanother that is contingent. This view comes in two main versions.\nAccording to the first version, both propositions are semantically\nexpressed by the sentence. Proponents of this account need to\nformulate a semantic theory that explains how that is possible.\nAccording to the second version, only one of these propositions is\nsemantically expressed by the sentence, while the other is the\nproposition that is communicated by a typical assertoric use of the\nsentence. A philosopher holding this view needs to explain the\npragmatic mechanism by which an utterance of the sentence comes to\ncommunicate the second proposition.\n\nThe first version of monism has been developed by David Chalmers and\nFrank Jackson (Chalmers 1996, 1999, 2002a,b, 2004, 2006a,b; Chalmers\nand Jackson 2001; Jackson 1998, 2004, 2011), who build on earlier work\nby David Kaplan (1989a,b), Gareth Evans (1979) and Martin Davies and\nLloyd Humberstone (1980), and others. On Chalmers\u2019s and\nJackson\u2019s view, what explains the phenomena uncovered by Kripke\nis not a difference between two spaces of possible worlds. There is\nonly a single space of possible worlds: the metaphysically possible\nworlds\u2014the ways the world could have been\u2014just are the\nepistemically possible worlds: the ways the world might be for all we\ncan know independently of empirical evidence. What explains the data\nis a difference between two different ways in which sentences can be\nused to describe the worlds in that space, i.e., between two\ndifferent notions of a sentence\u2019s being true in a world. The\ndistinction can be illustrated by appeal to our example of the proper\nname \u2018Phosphorus.\u2019 Suppose that we have just introduced\nthis name by using the description \u2018the last celestial body\nvisible in the morning\u2019 to fix its reference. Consider a\npossible world \\(w\\) where the description singles out, not Venus (as\nin our world), but Saturn. Assume further that in \\(w\\) (as in the\nactual world), Venus is the second planet from the sun, but Saturn is\nnot. Consider:\n\n(5)\n Phosphorus is the second planet from the sun.\n\n\nIs (5) true in \\(w\\)? There are two different ways of understanding\nthis question. On the one hand, it could mean something roughly like\nthis: if \\(w\\) actually obtains (contrary to what astronomers tell\nus), is Phosphorus the second planet from the sun? The answer to that\nquestion is surely \u2018no.\u2019 \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 refers\nto whatever is actually the last celestial body visible in the\nmorning, and on the assumption that \\(w\\) actually obtains, that\nobject is Saturn, and is therefore not the second planet. As Chalmers\nwould put it, (5) is not true at w considered as\n actual.[5]\n But we can also interpret the question differently: if \\(w\\)\nhad obtained, then would Phosphorus have been the\nsecond planet? In considering that question, we are not hypothetically\nassuming that the object that actually satisfies the reference-fixing\ndescription is Saturn. Instead, we can draw freely on our belief that\nthe object actually fitting the description is Venus, so that the name\npicks out Venus in all possible worlds. Since Venus is the second\nplanet in \\(w\\), it is true to say: if \\(w\\) had obtained, then\nPhosphorus would have been the second planet. In Chalmers\u2019s\nterminology, (5) is true at w considered as\ncounterfactual.\n\nThe distinction between the two concepts of truth in a world can be\nexplained within a theoretical framework known as two-dimensional\nsemantics, which assigns to a sentence like (5) an intension that\nis a function, not from worlds to truth-values, but from\npairs of worlds to truth-values. The intension of (5) is the\nfunction that assigns the true to a pair of worlds \\(\\langle u; w\n\\rangle\\) just in case the object that is the last celestial body\nvisible in the morning in \\(u\\) is the second planet in\n \\(w\\).[6]\n This account makes it easy to define the two notions of truth in a\nworld. A sentence \\(P\\) is true in \\(w\\) considered as actual just in\ncase the two-dimensional function assigns the true to \\(\\langle w;\nw\\rangle\\). \\(P\\) is true in \\(w\\) considered as counterfactual just\nin case, where \\(u\\) is the actual world, the two-dimensional function\nassigns the true to \\(\\langle u; w\\rangle\\). Note that the\ntwo-dimensional intension of (5) determines whether (5) is true at a\nworld \\(w\\) considered as actual. But it does not in general determine\nwhether (5) is true at \\(w\\) considered as counterfactual. That also\ndepends on which world is actual. Knowledge of a sentence\u2019s\ntwo-dimensional intension is therefore not in general sufficient to\nknow whether the sentence is true at \\(w\\) considered as\ncounterfactual. Further empirical evidence may be required.\n\nWhen combined with the conception of a sentence\u2019s content as the\nset of worlds where it is true, the distinction between the two\nconcepts of truth in a world yields a distinction between two\ndifferent propositions expressed by a sentence. The first of these\npropositions is the function that assigns the true to a world \\(w\\)\njust in case the sentence is true in \\(w\\) considered as actual, while\nthe second proposition is the function that assigns the true to a\nworld \\(w\\) just in case the sentence is true in \\(w\\) considered as\ncounterfactual. Jackson calls the former proposition the\nsentence\u2019s \u2018A-intension\u2019 (for \u2018actual\u2019)\nand the latter its \u2018C-intension\u2019 (for\n\u2018counterfactual\u2019), while Chalmers calls the former the\n\u2018primary intension\u2019 and the latter the \u2018secondary\nintension.\u2019 The distinction between the two propositions\nexpressed by a sentence yields a distinction between two notions of\nsentential necessity: primary necessity, which applies to sentences\nwith necessary primary intensions, and secondary necessity, which\napplies to sentences with necessary secondary intensions. If a\nsentence has primary necessity, then that fact, and a\nfortiori the fact that the sentence is true, can be read off its\ntwo-dimensional intension. Therefore, if we know the two-dimensional\nintension, then that is enough to know that the sentence is true. No\nfurther empirical evidence is required. That motivates the thought\nthat the notion of primary necessity captures the idea of a prioricity\nor epistemic necessity. The notion of secondary necessity, on the\nother hand, may be taken to capture the Kripkean idea of metaphysical\nnecessity.\n\nThis account makes it straightforward to explain cases of a\nposteriori necessity: they are simply cases of sentences whose\nsecondary intensions are necessary, but whose primary intensions are\ncontingent. Suppose that \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 were introduced, respectively, by the\nreference-fixing descriptions \u2018the first celestial body visible\nin the evening (if it exists)\u2019 and \u2018the last celestial\nbody visible in the morning (if it exists).\u2019 Since the two\ndescriptions single out the same object in the actual world, the\nsentence \u2018If Hesperus exists, then Hesperus is Phosphorus\u2019\nis true in all worlds considered as counterfactual, and therefore has\na necessary secondary intension. However, in some non-actual worlds,\nthe two descriptions single out different objects. The sentence is\nfalse in such a world considered as actual. The primary intension of\nthe sentence is therefore contingent.\n\nAn analogous account can be given of Kripke\u2019s examples of the\ncontingent a priori: these concern sentences whose primary\nintensions are necessary and whose secondary intensions are\ncontingent. Assume again that the reference of \u2018Julius\u2019 is\nfixed by the description \u2018the inventor of the zip (if such a\nperson exists).\u2019 Then in every world considered as actual, the\nname singles out the person who is the inventor of the zip in that\nworld (if there is such a person) or nothing (if no such person exists\nin the world). The primary intension of (4) is necessary. However,\nwhen we evaluate (4) in a world \\(w\\) considered as counterfactual,\n\u2018Julius\u2019 picks out the individual who is the\nactual inventor of the zip (provided that there actually is\nsuch an individual and that he or she exists in \\(w)\\). And since\nthere are possible worlds where that individual exists but is not the\ninventor of the zip, the secondary intension of (4) is contingent.\n\nChalmers (2002a, 2010) and Jackson (1998) have tried to support their\nmodal monism by arguing that it is gratuitous to postulate two forms\nof modality, given that all the phenomena pointed out by Kripke can be\naccommodated by appeal to a single kind of modality. Dualists may\nreply that the greater simplicity in the view of modality has been\nachieved only by adding complexity to the semantic theory. That\nresponse could be answered by arguing that two-dimensional semantics\ncan be motivated by independent considerations. That, of course, is\ncontroversial, as is the general viability of two-dimensional\nsemantics (see the entry\n two-dimensional semantics\n for detailed discussion).\n\nIn addition, it is not obvious that the view of Chalmers and Jackson\ncan satisfactorily explain all the phenomena discussed in\n section 1.1.\n Some commentators have denied that it can give a viable general\naccount of Kripkean examples (see, e.g., Soames 2005; Vaidya 2008;\nRoca-Royes 2011). In any case, it is clear that the view can only\nexplain how necessity and epistemic necessity can come apart for\nsentences whose primary and secondary intensions differ. That may be\ntrue of the cases considered by Kripke, but it seems doubtful for the\nother examples considered in\n section 1.1\n (mathematical and metaphysical truths, laws, and principles\nconnecting the physical to the mental). In response, Chalmers has\nargued that none of the latter cases are genuine examples of the\nnecessary a posteriori (1999, 2002a).\n\nThe second version of monism allows us to accommodate the\nphenomena considered in\n section 1.1\n while staying much closer to the picture sketched in the introduction\nto\n section 1.\n On this view, the data can be explained by appeal to a single space\nof possible worlds and a single notion of truth in a world. The\nproposition semantically expressed by a sentence containing a proper\nname or natural-kind term is a function from individual worlds to\ntruth-values. The proposition expressed by \u2018Phosphorus\nexists,\u2019 e.g., is a function that assigns the true to those\nworlds where Venus exists and the false to the other worlds. (If the\nreference of \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 was determined by a\nreference-fixing description together with the facts about which\nentity meets the description, then that fact itself is not a\nsemantic fact, but a metasemantic one, i.e., it does\nnot concern the question of what the meaning of the word is, but the\nquestion of how the meaning of the word is determined.) What explains\nthe impression that a sentence like (1) expresses an a\nposteriori claim is the fact that the proposition asserted by a\ntypical utterance of the sentence is not the one that is semantically\nexpressed by it, but a different proposition that is contingent and\ncan only be known empirically.\n\nRobert Stalnaker (1978, 2001) has given a detailed account of the\npragmatic mechanism by which a contingent proposition comes to be\nasserted by the utterance of a sentence that semantically expresses a\nnecessary proposition. On his account, linguistic communication\nevolves in a context characterized by background assumptions that are\nshared between the participants. These assumptions can be represented\nby the set of worlds at which they are jointly true, which Stalnaker\ncalls the \u2018context set.\u2019 The point of assertion is to add\nthe proposition asserted to the set of background assumptions and\nthereby eliminate worlds where it is not true from the context set. To\nachieve this, every assertion needs to conform to the rule that the\nproposition asserted is false in some of the worlds that were in the\ncontext set before the utterance (otherwise there are no worlds to\neliminate) and true in others (since the audience cannot eliminate all\nworlds from the context set). Now consider a context where the shared\nbackground assumptions include the proposition that the references of\n\u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 were fixed by certain\ndescriptions but leave open whether the two descriptions single out\nthe same object. Suppose that someone says \u2018\\(A\\) is\n\\(B\\).\u2019 In every world in the context set, the sentence\nsemantically expresses either a necessary truth (if the two\ndescriptions single out the same object in the world) or a necessary\nfalsehood (if they don\u2019t). If the proposition that the speaker\nintends to assert were the one that is semantically expressed by the\nsentence, the aforementioned rule would be\n violated.[7]\n To avoid attributing this rule violation to the speaker, the audience\nwill construe the utterance as expressing a different proposition, and\nthe most natural candidate is the proposition that the sentence\nuttered semantically expresses a true proposition. (Stalnaker calls\nthis the \u2018diagonal proposition.\u2019) By exploiting this\nmechanism of reinterpretation, a speaker can use the sentence to\nexpress the diagonal proposition. This proposition is true in just\nthose worlds in the context set where the two descriptions single out\nthe same object. It is clearly a contingent proposition, and empirical\nevidence is required to know it. Stalnaker suggests an analogous\nexplanation of Kripke\u2019s proposed cases of contingent a\npriori truth (1978, 83f.).\n\nStalnaker\u2019s account of the necessary a posteriori\nrequires that the proposition semantically expressed by the sentence\nand the proposition that the sentence semantically expresses a truth\nhold in different worlds in the context set. And that seems to require\nthat the assumptions shared between the participants of the\nconversation don\u2019t determine what proposition is semantically\nexpressed by the sentence. It has been argued that that assumption is\nimplausible in some cases of Kripkean a posteriori\nnecessities (Soames 2005, 96\u2013105). Suppose that I point to the\ndesk in my office in broad daylight and say \u2018That desk (if it\nexists) is made of wood.\u2019 Unless the context is highly unusual,\nthe shared assumptions, so the argument goes, uniquely determine what\nproposition is expressed by the sentence.\n2. Metaphysical and Nomic Modality\n\nIt often seems very natural to use modal terminology when talking\nabout the laws of nature. We are inclined to say that nothing\ncan move faster than light to express the fact that the laws\nrule out superluminal motion, and to state Newton\u2019s First Law by\nsaying that an object cannot depart from uniform rectilinear\nmotion unless acted on by an external force. This motivates the\nthought that there is a form of necessity associated with the natural\n laws.[8]\n It is controversial, however, whether that form of necessity is\nsimply metaphysical necessity, or another kind of necessity. The\nformer view is taken by necessitarians (Swoyer 1982;\nShoemaker 1980, 1998; Tweedale 1984; Fales 1993; Ellis 2001; Bird\n2005), who believe that the laws (or the laws conditionalized on the\nexistence of the properties mentioned in them) are metaphysically\nnecessary. Contingentists deny that, but many contingentists\nhold that there is a kind of necessity distinct from metaphysical\nnecessity that is characteristic of the laws (e.g., Fine 2002), and\nwhich may be called natural or nomic necessity. It\nis often assumed that nomic necessity is a weaker form of necessity\nthan metaphysical necessity: it attaches to the laws and to all truths\nthat are metaphysically necessitated by them, so that anything that is\nmetaphysically necessary is also nomically necessary, but not vice\nversa.\n\nNecessitarians have given several arguments for their position. Here\nare two.\n\nThe argument from causal essentialism (e.g., Shoemaker 1980,\n1998). Some philosophers believe that the causal powers that a\nproperty confers on its instances are essential to it. Assuming that\ncausal laws describe the causal powers associated with properties, it\nfollows that these laws (or versions of them that are conditionalized\non the existence of the relevant properties) are necessary truths.\nThis is, in the first instance, only an argument for the necessity of\ncausal laws, but perhaps it can be argued that all laws of\nnature are of this kind. Of course, even if this assumption is\ngranted, the argument is only as strong as the premise that properties\nhave their associated causal powers essentially. To support this view,\nSydney Shoemaker (1980) has given a battery of epistemological\narguments. He points out that our knowledge of the properties that an\nobject possesses can only rest on their effects on us, and must\ntherefore be grounded in the causal powers associated with these\nproperties. But, he goes on to argue that, without a necessary\nconnection between the properties and the associated causal powers, an\nobject\u2019s effects on us could not serve as a source of all the\nknowledge about an object\u2019s properties that we take ourselves to\npossess.\n\nThe argument from counterfactual robustness (Swoyer 1982;\nFales 1990, 1993; also see Lange 2004 for discussion). Natural laws\nare often believed to differ from accidental generalizations by their\ncounterfactual robustness (counterfactual-supporting power).\nSetting aside some minor complications (see Lewis 1979a), we can\ndescribe this feature as follows: if it is a law that all \\(F\\)s\nare \\(G\\), then this generalization would still have been true if\nthere had been more \\(F\\)s than there actually are, or if some \\(F\\)s\nhad found themselves in conditions different from the ones that\nactually obtain. For example, it would still have been true that\nnothing moves faster than light if there had been more objects than\nthere actually are, or if some bodies had been moving in a different\ndirection. Contrast this with No emerald has ever decorated a\nroyal crown. That may be true, but it is not very robust. It\nwould have been false if some rulers of the past had made different\nfashion choices. Some necessitarians have argued that contingentism\nabout the laws cannot provide a plausible explanation of the special\ncounterfactual robustness of the laws. Note that a counterfactual\n\u201cif it had been the case that \\(P\\), then it would have been the\ncase that \\(Q\\)\u201d is usually taken to be true if \\(Q\\) is true in\nthose metaphysically possible \\(P\\)-worlds that are closest to\nactuality. On this view, the special counterfactual robustness of the\nlaw All \\(F\\)s are \\(G\\) amounts, roughly speaking, to this:\nof all the metaphysically possible worlds that contain some additional\n\\(F\\)s, or where some actual \\(F\\)s are in somewhat different\ncircumstances, the ones where the actual law holds are closer than the\nrest. If the laws hold in some metaphysically possible worlds but not\nin others, then the reason why the former are closer than the latter\nmust be that the rules we are using for deciding which worlds count as\nthe closest say so. But which such rules we use is a matter of\nconvention. The counterfactual-supporting power of the laws does not\nseem to be a purely conventional matter, however. Necessitarianism,\nthe argument continues, offers a better explanation: the laws hold in\nthe closest possible worlds simply because they hold in all\nmetaphysically possible worlds. Conventions don\u2019t come into it.\nThe contingentist may reply that, even though the counterfactual\nrobustness of the laws is grounded in a convention, that convention is\nnot arbitrary. Instead, it may have its rationale in\ncertain features of the laws that make them different from accidental\ngeneralizations in an objectively important way (Sidelle 2002),\ne.g., the fact that laws relate to pervasive and conspicuous patterns\nin the history of the world, or the fact that the truth of a law\n(unlike the truth of an accidental generalization) is explanatorily\nindependent of matters of particular fact (Kment 2015b,\n11\u201312).\n\nContingentism has often been defended by pointing out that the laws of\nnature can be known only a posteriori, and that their\nnegations are conceivable (see Sidelle 2002). Necessitarians may reply\nto the first point that Kripke\u2019s work has given us reasons for\nthinking that a posteriori truths can be metaphysically\nnecessary (see\n section 1.1).\n In response to the second point, they may grant that the negation of\na law is conceivable, but deny that conceivability is a good guide to\npossibility (see the entry\n epistemology of modality).\n Alternatively, they may deny that we can really conceive of a\nsituation in which, say, bodies violate the law of gravitation. What\nwe can conceive of is a situation in which objects move in ways that\nappear to violate the law. But that situation cannot be\ncorrectly be described as involving objects with mass.\nRather, the objects in the imagined situation have a different\nproperty that is very similar to mass (call it \u2018schmass\u2019)\nbut which is governed by slightly different laws. Contingentists may\nreply that the non-existence of schmass (or the non-existence of\nobjects that move in the way imagined) is itself a law, so that we\nhave, after all, conceived of a situation where one of the actual laws\nfails (see Fine 2002).\n3. The Structure of the Modal Realm\n\nThe concepts of metaphysical, epistemic, and nomic necessity are only\na few of the modal notions that figure in our thought and discourse\n(as should be clear from the long list of uses of modal terms given in\nthe introduction to this entry). We also speak of\n\n(6)\n Practical necessity\n\nLogical necessity\n\nBiological necessity\n\nMedical necessity\n\nMoral necessity\n\nLegal necessity \n\n\nand of a whole lot more. One would expect that some of these modal\nconcepts can be defined in terms of others. But how can that be done?\nAnd is it possible to single out a small number of fundamental notions\nof necessity in terms of which all the others can be defined?\n\nIt may be helpful in approaching these questions to distinguish\nbetween two salient ways in which one modal property can be defined in\nterms of another (Fine 2002, 254f.).\n\nRestriction. To say that property \\(N\\) can be defined\nfrom kind of necessity \\(N^*\\) by restriction is to say that\na proposition\u2019s having \\(N\\) can be defined as the combination\nof two things: (i) the proposition\u2019s having \\(N^*\\), and (ii)\nits meeting certain additional conditions.\nRelativization / quantifier restriction. To say that a\nproperty \\(N\\) can be defined from a kind of necessity \\(N^*\\) by\nrelativization to a class of propositions \\(S\\) is to say\nthat a proposition\u2019s having \\(N\\) can be defined as its being\n\\(N^*\\)-necessitated by \\(S\\). A closely related way in which a modal\nproperty can be defined in terms of another is by quantifier\nrestriction. Suppose that \\(P^*\\) is a kind of possibility that\nis the dual of \\(N^*\\) (in the sense that it is \\(P^*\\)-possible that\n\\(p\\) just in case it\u2019s not \\(N^*\\)-necessary that not-\\(p)\\),\nand that we have at our disposal the notion of a \\(P^*\\)-possible\nworld (a world that could \\(P^*\\)-possibly have been actualized). To\nsay that the property \\(N\\) can be defined from \\(N^*\\) by quantifier\nrestriction is to say that that a proposition\u2019s having \\(N\\) can\nbe defined as its being true in all \\(P^*\\)-possible worlds that meet\na certain condition \\(C\\). (This is only the simplest way of defining\na modal property from a kind of necessity by quantifier restriction.\nMuch more sophisticated methods have been proposed. See, e.g., Kratzer\n1977, 1991.) Given reasonable assumptions, every definition by\nrelativization corresponds to a definition by quantifier restriction,\nand vice\n versa.[9]\n\n\nRestriction allows us to define narrower modal properties from broader\nones. For example, it seems natural to define a proposition\u2019s\nbeing mathematically necessary as its being both metaphysically\nnecessary and a mathematical truth (Fine 2002, 255), or as its being\nmetaphysically necessary because it is a mathematical\ntruth. Maybe a proposition\u2019s being\nlogically necessary can similarly be defined as its being\nmetaphysically necessary because it is true in virtue of the natures\nof the logical constants (Fine 1994, 9\u201310; 2005, 237).\n(For a very different account that does not define logical necessity\nfrom metaphysical necessity by restriction, see Bacon 2018.)\n\nRelativization and quantifier restriction allow us to define broader\nmodal properties in terms of narrower ones. For example, it may be\nheld that biological necessity can be defined as the property of being\nmetaphysically (or perhaps nomically) necessitated by the basic\nprinciples of biology.\n\nA modal property \\(N\\) is called alethic just in case the\nclaim that a proposition has \\(N\\) entails that the proposition is\ntrue. Metaphysical, epistemic and nomic necessity are all alethic. By\ncontrast, moral and legal necessity are not. It is both morally and\nlegally necessary (i.e., it is required both by morality and by the\nlaw) that no murders are committed, even though murders are in fact\nbeing committed. A modal property defined by restriction from an\nalethic kind of necessity must itself be alethic. By contrast,\nrelativization allows us to define non-alethic modal properties from\nalethic ones, by relativizing to a class of propositions that contains\nsome falsehoods. Similarly, we can define a non-alethic modal property\nfrom an alethic one by restricting the quantifier over possible worlds\nto some class that does not include the actual world. For example,\nlegal necessity can perhaps be defined from metaphysical necessity by\nrestricting the quantifier to worlds where everybody conforms to the\nactual laws.\n\nThe properties listed in (6) can very naturally be called \u2018kinds\nof necessity,\u2019 and in some contexts they are the properties\nexpressed by necessity operators like \u2018must\u2019 and\n\u2018could not have been otherwise.\u2019 But that is not true of\nevery property that can be defined from some kind of necessity by\nrelativization or restriction. For example, we can define a property\nby relativizing metaphysical necessity to the class of truths stated\nin a certain book, but it would not be natural at all to call this\nproperty a kind of necessity. It is not plausible that there is a\nspecial form of necessity that attaches to all and only the\npropositions necessitated by the truths in the book. Similarly, the\nproperty defined by restricting metaphysical necessity to the truths\nabout cheddar cheese cannot naturally be called a kind of necessity.\nThere is no form of necessity that applies to just those necessary\npropositions that deal with cheddar and to none of the others. It is a\ngood question what distinguishes those properties defined by\nrelativization and restriction that we are willing to count as forms\nof necessity from the rest. Perhaps the most natural answer is that\nthe distinction is dictated by our interests and concerns, and does\nnot reflect a deep metaphysical difference.\n\nA more pressing question is whether some of the forms of necessity\ndiscussed in sections\n 1\n and\n 2\n can be defined in terms of the others by relativization or\nrestriction. Consider epistemic and metaphysical necessity first, and\nsuppose for the sake of the argument that dualism is true and the two\nproperties are indeed different forms of necessity. Can one of them be\ndefined in terms of the other by one of the aforementioned methods?\nNot if there are both necessary a posteriori and contingent\na priori propositions, since relativization and restriction\nonly allow us to define one property in terms of another if the\nextension of one is a subclass of that of the other. However, the\nexistence of contingent a priori truths is more controversial\nthan that of necessary a posteriori propositions, and someone\ntrying to define epistemic necessity in terms of metaphysical\nnecessity or vice versa may repudiate the contingent a priori\nand hold that the extension of epistemic necessity is included in that\nof metaphysical necessity. Then such a philosopher could try (a) to\ndefine metaphysical necessity from epistemic necessity by\nrelativization to some suitable class, or (b) to define epistemic\nnecessity from metaphysical necessity by restriction.\n\nSuch a definition may get the extension of the definiendum right. But\na definition may be intended to do much more than that: it may be\nmeant to tell us what it \\(is\\) for something to fall under the\nconcept to be defined. Suppose that someone tried to define the\nproperty of being an equiangular triangle as that of being a triangle\nwhose sides are of equal length. While this is extensionally correct,\nit does not give us the right account of what it is for something to\nbe an equiangular triangle (what it is for something to have that\nproperty has something to do with the sizes of its angles, not with\nthe lengths of its sides). It could be argued that definitions of type\n(a) and (b) face similar difficulties. For example, a definition of\nkind (a) entails that a proposition\u2019s being metaphysically\nnecessary consists in its being epistemically necessitated by a\ncertain class of propositions. But that would make metaphysical\nnecessity an epistemic property, and dualists typically want to resist\nthat idea. Similarly for definitions of type (b). Whether something is\nepistemically necessary (in the sense of being a priori)\nseems to be a purely epistemic matter. A priori propositions\nmay also be metaphysically necessary, but their metaphysical necessity\nisn\u2019t part of what makes them a priori, and\ntherefore shouldn\u2019t be mentioned in a definition of a\nprioricity.\n\nIf this argument is correct, then it is impossible to define epistemic\nmodal properties in terms of non-epistemic ones, or vice versa. But\nwhat about metaphysical and nomic necessity? Suppose for the sake of\nthe argument that there is such a thing as nomic necessity (a form of\nnecessity associated with the laws of nature) but that contingentism\nabout the natural laws is true, so that nomic necessity is indeed\ndistinct from metaphysical necessity. Can we define one of these\nproperties in terms of the other? The most natural way of doing this\nwould be to say that\n\n(7)\n Nomic necessity can be defined as the property of being\nmetaphysically necessitated by the laws of nature.\n\n\nSuch a definition may be extensionally accurate, and many philosophers\nwould not hesitate to endorse it. But others have doubted that it\ncaptures what it \\(is\\) for a proposition to be nomically necessary\n(Fine 2002). Nomic necessity is a special modal status enjoyed by all\nand only the propositions that are metaphysically necessitated by the\nnatural laws. Now, if \\(P\\) is metaphysically necessitated by the laws\nwithout itself being a law, then it may seem plausible to say, in some\nsense, that \\(P\\) has that special modal status because \\(P\\)\nis metaphysically necessitated by the laws. But the reason why being\nmetaphysically necessitated by the laws confers that special modal\nstatus on \\(P\\) is presumably that the laws themselves have that modal\nstatus and that this modal status gets transmitted across metaphysical\nnecessitation. But if we now ask what makes it so that the laws\nthemselves have that special modal status, (7) does not seem to give\nus the correct answer: the special necessity of the laws doesn\u2019t\nconsist in the fact that they are metaphysically necessitated by the\nlaws. Hence, (7) cannot be a correct general account of what\nconstitutes that special modal status.\n\nIt is open to debate which kinds of necessity are fundamental, in the\nsense that all others can be defined in terms of them, while they are\nnot themselves definable in terms of others. The monist view\nconsidered in\n section 1.3,\n when combined with (7), may inspire the hope that we can make do with\na single fundamental kind of necessity. Others have argued that there\nare several kinds of necessity that are not mutually reducible. For\nexample, Fine (2002) suggests (in a discussion that sets aside\nepistemic modality) that there are three fundamental kinds of\nnecessity, which he calls \u2018metaphysical,\u2019\n\u2018nomic\u2019 and \u2018normative\u2019 necessity. (For\nfurther discussion of normative necessity, see Rosen 2020.)\n\nThe reduction of the various kinds of necessity to a small number of\nfundamental ones would be an important step towards the goal of a\nunified account of\n modality.[10]\n But those who believe that there are several different fundamental\nkinds of necessity need to address another question: What is the\ncommon feature of these fundamental kinds of necessity that makes them\nall kinds of necessity? Why do they count as kinds of necessity, while\nother properties don\u2019t?\n\nOne strategy for answering this question, which centers on\nnon-epistemic forms of necessity, starts from a certain conception of\nwhat (non-epistemic) necessity consists in: for a proposition to be\nnecessary is for its truth to be, in a certain sense, particularly\nsecure, unshakable, and unconditional in a wholly objective way.\nA necessary truth could not easily have been false (it could less\neasily have been false than a contingent truth). We may call this\nfeature of a proposition \u2018modal force.\u2019 It is natural to\napply this conception to metaphysical and nomic necessity. Each of\nthese properties may be held to consist in having a certain grade of\nmodal force, though if contingentism is true, the degree of modal\nforce required for nomic necessity is lower than that required for\nmetaphysical necessity. We could then say that a property is one of\nthe fundamental forms of necessity just in case a proposition\n\\(P\\)\u2019s possessing that property consists entirely in\n\\(P\\)\u2019s having a specific grade of modal force. Other kinds of\nnecessity, like those listed in (6) can be defined from the\nfundamental ones by relativization or restriction. Having these\nproperties does not consist simply in having a specific grade\nof modal force (and these properties therefore aren\u2019t among the\nfundamental kinds of necessity). For example, if a property is defined\nby relativizing metaphysical necessity to a class of propositions\n\\(S\\), then the fact that a proposition \\(P\\) has that property\nconsists in the fact that the connection between \\(S\\) and\n\\(P\\) has a certain grade of modal force. But that is not the same\nthing as P itself having a certain grade of modal force.\nSimilarly, if a property is defined from, say, metaphysical necessity\nby restriction, then having that property does not consist\nmerely in possessing such-and-such a grade of modal force,\nbut in the conjunction of that feature with some other property.\n\nThis approach evidently leaves the question of how to understand the\nidea of modal force (of a proposition\u2019s truth being very\nunshakable). Some authors have attempted to explain this notion in\ncounterfactual terms (see Lewis 1973a, \u00a72.5; Lewis 1973b,\n\u00a72.1; McFetridge 1990, 150ff.; Lange 1999, 2004, 2005; Williamson\n2005, 2008; Hill 2006; Kment 2006a; cp. Jackson 1998, Chalmers 2002a):\nthe necessary truths are distinguished from the contingent ones by the\nfact that they are not only true as things actually are, but that they\nwould still have been true if things had been different in various\nways. To capture this idea more precisely, Lange (2005) introduces the\nconcept of \u2018stability\u2019: a deductively closed set \\(S\\) of\ntruths is stable just in case, for any claim \\(P\\) in \\(S\\) and any\nclaim \\(Q\\) consistent with \\(S\\), it is true in any context to say\nthat it would still have been the case that \\(P\\) if it had been the\ncase that \\(Q\\). The different forms of necessity have in common that\ntheir extensions are stable sets.\n\nKment (2006a, 2014, chs. 1\u20132) argues that modal force, and hence\nnecessity and possibility, come in many degrees (cp. Williamson 2016).\nWe often talk about such degrees of possibility when we say things\nlike \u2018Team \\(A\\) could more easily have won than Team\n\\(B\\),\u2019 \u2018Team \\(A\\) could easily have won\u2019 or\n\u2018Team \\(A\\) almost won.\u2019 The first utterance states that\n\\(A\\)\u2019s winning had a greater degree of possibility than\n\\(B\\)\u2019s winning, while the second and third simply ascribe a\nhigh degree of possibility to \\(A\\)\u2019s winning. A\nproposition\u2019s degree of possibility is the higher the less of a\ndeparture from actuality is required for it to be true. Suppose, e.g.,\nthat Team \\(A\\) would have won if one of their players had stood just\nan inch further to the left at a crucial moment during the game. Then\nwe can truly say that the team could easily have won. More formally,\n\\(P\\)\u2019s degree of possibility is the higher the closer the\nclosest \\(P\\)-worlds are to actuality (also see Lewis 1973a,\n\u00a72.5; Lewis 1973b, \u00a72.1; Kratzer 1991). Similarly, a\ntruth\u2019s degree of necessity is measured by the distance from\nactuality to the closest worlds where it is false. What metaphysical\nnecessity, nomic necessity and the other grades of necessity have in\ncommon is that each of them is the property of having a degree of\npossibility that is above a certain threshold. What distinguishes them\nis a difference in their associated thresholds.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Armstrong, D., 1983, <em>What Is a Law of Nature?</em>, Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1991, \u201cWhat Makes Induction\nRational?\u201d, <em>Dialogue</em>, 30: 503\u2013511.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1993, \u201cThe Identification Problem and\nthe Inference Problem\u201d, <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological\nResearch</em>, 53: 421\u2013422.", "Ayer, A.
