    "main_text": "Noseeum Arguments || Individual Case Argument\n3.1 Individual Case Argument\n\nTo understand the first argument, some background in confirmation\ntheory will be useful. On one standard understanding, a claim \\(E\\) is\nevidence against a hypothesis \\(H\\) just in case the probability of\n\\(H,\\) given \\(E,\\) is less than the probability of \\(H\\) on its own.\nMore formally: \\(E\\) is evidence against \\(H\\) just in case \\(Pr(H\\mid\nE) \\lt Pr(H)\\). Furthermore, the lower the difference between\n\\(Pr(H\\mid E)\\) and \\(Pr(H),\\) the stronger \\(E\\) is evidence\nagainst \\(H\\). To determine if \\(E\\) is evidence against \\(H,\\) one\nconsiders two key conditional probabilities: first, the probability of\n\\(E\\) given \\(H,\\) and second, the probability of \\(E\\) given the\ndenial of \\(H\\). More formally, \\(Pr(E\\mid H)\\) and \\(Pr(E\\mid \\neg\nH),\\) respectively. Now if \\(Pr(E\\mid \\neg H)\\) is greater than\n\\(Pr(E\\mid H)\\) then \\(E\\) will be evidence against \\(H\\). And the\ngreater \\(Pr(E\\mid \\neg H)\\) is than \\(Pr(E\\neg H)\\) the stronger\n\\(E\\) will be evidence against \\(H\\).\n\nNext, reconsider:\n\nNo-Known-Goods (NKG)\n\nNo outweighing goods we know of would justify God\u2019s permission\nof the fawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s suffering.\n\n(We\u2019ll ignore the objection of 2.3 and assume\nNKG is true.) NKG is a noseeum\nclaim, since it asserts that we \u201cno see\u201d any outweighing\ngoods that would justify God\u2019s permission of that specific\nsuffering. To determine if NKG is evidence against\ntheism, we need to consider two conditional probabilities: how likely\nis it given the denial of theism and how likely is it given theism.\nRowe (1996: 267\u201370) argues that the probability of\nNKG given atheism is 1. For if there is no God, then\nGod doesn\u2019t permit anything. Thus, if there is no God, then\nnothing justifies God\u2019s permission of anything, since God\ndoesn\u2019t permit anything. Thus, if there is no God, then no\noutweighing good we know of would justify God\u2019s permission of\nanything\u2014including the fawn\u2019s suffering and the\ngirl\u2019s suffering.\n\nIf the probability of NKG given atheism is 1, then\nthe lower probability it has given theism, the stronger the evidence\nNKG is against theism. And one might argue that the\nprobability of NKG given theism is not high\u2014at\nleast below 0.5\u2014because God would not let us suffer in silence.\nThat is, if God permitted the suffering of the fawn and the girl for\nsome outweighing good, then God would at least tell us what those\ngoods are or\u2014if that\u2019s not possible for whatever\nreason\u2014at least offer some kind of comfort for the suffering in\nsome way (cf. Rowe 2006: 86\u20137). So given theism, we\nshouldn\u2019t expect that no good we know of would justify\nGod\u2019s permission of these evils\u2014God would tell us about\nthose goods or at least comfort us.\n\nSkeptical theists object to this argument that the probability of\nNKG, given theism, is not high (cf. Bergmann 2001).\nPresumably, God would not let us suffer in silence because such\nsilence serves no outweighing good. But it is hard to see how one\ncould establish that it serves no outweighing good, if\nST1 and ST2\nare true. After all, even if no good we know of would justify God\nletting us suffer in silence, given ST1\nand ST2, it would not be reasonable to\ninfer that no such good would. So this argument fails to show that\nNKG is not high given theism.\n",
