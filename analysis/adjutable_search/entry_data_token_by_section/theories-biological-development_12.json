    "main_text": "Twentieth-Century Genetics: A New Predeterminism || Waddington\u2019s landscape\n9.1 Waddington\u2019s landscape\n\nIn this context, Waddington\u2019s theoretical approach was\ndistinctive, aiming to integrate genetics and epigenetic development.\nHis main device for doing so was \u201cthe epigenetic\nlandscape\u201d, first articulated in 1939 and iconically diagrammed\nin The Strategy of the Genes (1957). Waddington\u2019s\nlandscape model represents developmental potential as\n\n\na more or less flat, or rather undulating surface, which is tilted so\nthat points representing later states are lower than those\nrepresenting earlier ones \u2026 Then if something, such as a ball,\nwere placed on the surface, it would run down toward some final end\nstate at the bottom edge. (1957: 29).\n\n\nThe model visualizes three \u201cessentially formal\u201d properties\nof development: unidirectionality in time (via the landscape\u2019s\ntilt), multiple discrete termini from a single undifferentiated start\n(via branching tracks), and robustness of developmental processes (via\nsteepness of valley walls).\n\nThese topographic features reflect generalizations about animal\ndevelopment, based mainly on experiments on chick and Drosophila. A\nrolling ball\u2019s path down the incline corresponds to the\ndevelopment of some cell or tissue from an early undifferentiated\nstate to a mature differentiated state.\n\nWhat controls the path taken by a cell or piece of developing\ntissue\u2014a pre-determined genetic program or ongoing orchestration\nof stimuli? Waddington (1939, 1940, 1957) identified genes as the\ndeterminants of epigenetic landscape topography. This is depicted in a\ncompanion diagram showing the landscape\u2019s\n\u201cunderside\u201d as a network of interacting biochemical\nproducts \u201cwhich are ultimately controlled by genes\u201d (1957:\n36). Waddington first articulated the landscape analogy in 1939, as a\ngeneralization of time- and dose-effect curves representing the role\nof genes in producing specific phenotypic effects. The landscape model\nresults from including interactive effects of the entire genome on a\nparticular pathway:\n\n\n[o]ne might roughly say that all these genes correspond to the\ngeological structure which moulds the form of the valley. (1939:\n182)\n\n\nAlthough he featured genetic control, Waddington\u2019s designation\nof the landscape as \u201cepigenetic\u201d suggests a view of\ndevelopment allowing more of a role for epigenesis than more\ngene-focused contemporaries. Scott Gilbert (1991) argues that the\nbranching-track lineage structure unifies development and genetics,\nvisualizing a formal analogy between cellular, genetic, and organismal\ndevelopment. Fagan (2012, 2013a) extends this argument, focusing on\nWaddington\u2019s unification of two complementary landscape images:\nrobust pathways above, and interacting gene products below, with genes\nat the bottom, metaphorically \u201cpulling the strings\u201d.\nNicoglou and Merlin (2017) and Nicoglou (2018) discuss this unifying,\nintegrative feature of Waddington\u2019s landscape model as one\nstrand of twentieth-century epigenetics.\n\nWaddington\u2019s own later theorizing took a mathematical turn,\ninterpreting the notion of a field in terms of spatial relations and\nusing R\u00e9n\u00e9 Thom\u2019s topology to theorize\ndevelopmental pathways as an epigenetic system (1968). This work\nemphasized the concept of \u201cchreod\u201d, a trajectory (directed\npath) of normal development within multidimensional space, with axes\nfor time, three spatial dimensions, and concentrations of chemicals.\nAlthough not fruitful in biology at the time, Waddington\u2019s\nmathematical approach anticipated twenty-first-century alternatives to\nthe idea of genetic control (see\n Section 10).\n In that context, the landscape model has experienced a renaissance.\nThe underside image is replaced by complex gene regulatory networks,\ntopside surfaces explicated in terms of systems biology and/or stem\ncell concepts (Fagan 2012, 2013a). Fusco and colleagues (2014) discuss\nrecent theoretical proposals (e.g., Wang, Wang, & Huang 2010) to\n\u201crehabilitate\u201d Waddington\u2019s landscape as a dynamical\nsystems model, which require significant changes from the original.\nThey conclude that landscape models (updated or not) are good for\nvisualizing cell differentiation but not other important developmental\nprocesses\u2014and so not well-suited for a comprehensive theory of\ndevelopment. As a metaphorical aid to understanding, however,\nWaddington\u2019s landscape remains influential. Jan Baedke (2013)\nexamines its broader impact across the life sciences, extending beyond\norganismal development to developmental psychology and cultural\nanthropology.\n",
