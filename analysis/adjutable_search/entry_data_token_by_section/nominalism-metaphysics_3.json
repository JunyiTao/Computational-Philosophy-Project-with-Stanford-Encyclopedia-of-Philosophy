    "main_text": "Arguments against abstract objects and universals\n3. Arguments against abstract objects and universals\n\n\nAre there general arguments against abstract objects? There are\nsome, although it must be said that some of the most famous deniers of\nabstract objects have not always based their rejection on arguments.\nThis is the case, for instance, of Goodman and Quine who, in their\nSteps toward a Constructive Nominalism, base their rejection\nof mathematical abstract objects on a basic intuition (1947, 105).\n\n\nOne argument against postulating abstract objects is based on\nOckham's razor. According to this principle one should not\nmultiply entities or kinds of entities unnecessarily. Thus if one can\nshow that certain concrete objects can perform the theoretical roles\nusually associated with abstract objects, one should refrain from\npostulating abstract objects. The effectiveness of this kind of appeal\nto Ockham's razor is, of course, conditional upon our having been\nshown that concrete objects can play the theoretical roles associated\nwith abstract objects. But if every theoretical role played by\nabstracta can be played by concreta and vice versa,\nthen one needs a further reason why one should postulate\nconcreta only rather than abstracta only. Sometimes\nthe only evidence for the existence of the abstracta in\nquestion is that they perform the theoretical role in question. In that\ncase one can use the principle that one should not postulate ad\nhoc entities or kinds of entities unnecessarily (Rodriguez-Pereyra\n2002, 210\u201316). That is, one should not postulate, if possible,\nentities for which there is no independent evidence, i.e. entities for\nthe existence of which the only evidence available is that they\nsatisfactorily perform a certain theoretical role.\n\n\nAnother common and widely discussed argument against abstract\nobjects is an epistemological argument. The argument is grounded in the\nthought that given that abstract objects are causally inert, it is\ndifficult to understand how we can have knowledge or reliable belief\nabout them. Sometimes a similar argument is advanced according to which\nthe problem with Platonism is that, given the causal inertness of\nabstract objects, it cannot explain how linguistic or mental reference\nto abstract objects is possible (see Benacerraf 1973 and Field 1989,\n25\u20137). Admittedly these arguments do not conclusively establish\nNominalism but, if they work, they show an explanatory lacuna\nin Platonism. The challenge for the Platonist is to explain how\nknowledge of and reference to abstract objects is possible. Most of the\ndebate with respect to this argument has concentrated on the particular\napplication of the argument to the case of mathematical objects (for\nmore on this debate see the entry on\n Platonism in metaphysics \n and Burgess and Rosen 1997, pp.\n35\u201360.)\n\n\nAnother, now less common, argument against Platonism, is that its\nontology is unintelligible. Sometimes the unintelligibility of abstract\nobjects is linked to their lack of clear and intelligible conditions of\nidentity. But it is not the abstractness of abstract objects that makes\nthem lack clear identity conditions, since some abstract objects, like\nsets, have clear and intelligible conditions of identity. But the\nidentity conditions for sets are intelligible only if the notion of a\nset is intelligible. Some, like Goodman, are apparently unable to\nunderstand how different entities can be composed out of the same\nultimate constituents. But, again, it is not in virtue of being\nabstract, i.e. non-spatiotemporal and causally inert, that sets violate\nGoodman's principle on composition. For there could be\nsimple abstract objects.\n\n\nMany of these arguments and motivations for the rejection of\nabstract objects are also arguments and motivations for rejecting\nnon-spatiotemporal ante rem universals. But Ockham's razor can\nalso be used against universals conceived of as spatiotemporal\nentities, provided it can be shown that particulars can play the\ntheoretical roles normally assigned to in re universals. For even if\nthey are spatiotemporal, universals are nevertheless a distinctive kind\nof entity.\n\n\nThere are other, more specific arguments against universals. One is\nthat postulating such things leads to a vicious infinite regress. For\nsuppose there are universals, both monadic and relational, and that\nwhen an entity instantiates a universal, or a group of entities\ninstantiate a relational universal, they are linked by an instantiation\nrelation. Suppose now that a instantiates the universal\nF. Since there are many things that instantiate many\nuniversals, it is plausible to suppose that instantiation is a\nrelational universal. But if instantiation is a relational universal,\nwhen a instantiates F, a,\nF and the instantiation relation are linked by an instantiation\nrelation. Call this instantiation relation i2 (and suppose\nit, as is plausible, to be distinct from the instantiation relation\n(i1) that links a and F). Then\nsince i2 is also a universal, it looks as\nif a,\nF, i1 and i2\nwill have to be linked by another instantiation\nrelation i3, and so on ad\ninfinitum. (This argument has its source in Bradley 1893,\n27\u20138.)\n\n\nWhether this regress shows some sort of incoherence in realism about\nuniversals or is merely uneconomical is a debatable issue. The realist\nabout universals can, however, maintain that the regress is illusory,\nfor instance by maintaining that although particulars instantiate\nuniversals, this involves no relation between them (Armstrong 1997,\n 118).[7]\n\n\nOther arguments against universals are based on the principles that\nthere cannot be necessary connections between wholly distinct\nexistences and that no two things can be composed of exactly the same\n parts.[8] \n Consider the universal methane. A molecule\ninstantiates methane if and only if it consists of four\nhydrogen atoms bonded to a single carbon atom. Thus, necessarily,\nmethane is instantiated only if carbon is\ninstantiated. But this seems to be a necessary connection between two\nwholly distinct entities, the universals methane and\ncarbon. One answer here is that methane and\ncarbon are not wholly distinct universals since the universal\ncarbon is a component or a part of the universal\nmethane, the other parts being the universal hydrogen\nand the relational universal bonded. The problem here is that\na molecule instantiates butane if and only if it consists of a\nchain of four carbon atoms, with the adjacent ones bonded, and the end\ncarbon atoms are bonded to three hydrogen atoms each, while the middle\ncarbon atoms are bonded to two hydrogen atoms each (thus the formula\nfor butane is\nCH3-CH2-CH2-CH3). So, if\nbutane is not to be necessarily connected to wholly distinct\nuniversals, one should say that carbon, hydrogen and\nbonded are the parts of butane. But then\nmethane and butane are composed of exactly the same\nparts. So it looks as if structural universals (i.e. universals like\nmethane and butane, such that whatever instantiates\nthem must consist of parts instantiating certain universals and\nstanding in certain relations to each other) offend either against the\nprinciple that there are no necessary connections between wholly\ndistinct existences or the principle that no two entities can be\ncomposed of exactly the same parts (see Lewis 1986b for further\ndiscussion).\n\n\nThis, in itself, is not an argument against universals per\nse but only against structural universals. Even so, if a\ntheory of universals must postulate states of affairs, as Armstrong\nthinks it must, then the argument can be made to work against\nuniversals in general. For the state of affairs that Rab\n(where R is any non-symmetrical relation) necessitates that\nb exists, which seems to be a necessary connection between\nwholly distinct existences. And saying that a, b and\nR are parts of the state of affairs that Rab means\ntrouble if one thinks that no two entities can be composed of exactly\nthe same parts, for the distinct state of affairs that Rba\nwould also be composed of a, b and R. There\nare two things the defender of universals can do: (a) to accept simple,\nnon-structural universals but reject both structural universals and\nstates of affairs; (b) to accept that some entities can be composed of\nexactly the same parts (provided they are related in different ways).\n(b) seems to be more popular among realists about universals. (See\nArmstrong 1986, Forrest 1986b and Armstrong 1997, 31\u201338, for\nfurther discussion.)\n",
