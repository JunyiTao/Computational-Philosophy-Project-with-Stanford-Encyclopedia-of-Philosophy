    "main_text": "Ethics || Natural Law\n8.2 Natural Law\n\nAquinas\u2019s moral theory does not offer the sort of brief and\ncomprehensive criterion for rightness and wrongness that draws\nstudents toward\n consequentialism\n or\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.\n What he offers instead is a deep and systematic explanation of where\nmorality comes from, yielding a moral code that is impressively\nresponsive to the changing circumstances of human life.\n\nThe key text for Aquinas\u2019s thinking about the moral law is his\nTreatise on Law (ST 1a2ae 90\u2013108). There he\ndistinguishes between four kinds of law that play a role in guiding\nright human action:\n\neternal law: God\u2019s plan of governance for the world (q.\n93);\nnatural law: the distinctive way rational beings participate in\nthe eternal law (q. 94);\nhuman law: particular developments of natural law worked out by\nhuman reason (qq. 95\u201397);\ndivine law: divinely revealed laws directing human beings to their\nend (qq. 98\u2013108).\n\n\nThe eternal law governs everything, but can serve to guide us only\nwhen it is somehow transmitted to us. One way in which it is\ntransmitted is through divine law, preeminently through the Bible, and\nhere Aquinas distinguishes between the old law of the Hebrew Bible\n(qq. 98\u2013105) and the new law described in the Gospel (qq.\n106\u20138). The other form of transmission, philosophically the most\ninteresting part of his account, is the\n natural law.\n Whereas human law is the contingent result of social and political\norganization, the natural law is innate within us. Since Aquinas\nthinks that God orders everything to its proper end (\u00a78.1), there\nis a sense in which all things follow a natural law by which they\nparticipate in the eternal law. But when Aquinas refers to natural law\nin a moral context, he means the distinctive way in which rational\nagents have been ordered to achieve their proper end; hence he has in\nmind a law that governs the mind. Thus, \u201cthe law of nature is\nnothing other than the light of intellect, placed within us by God,\nthrough which we grasp what is to be done and what is to be\navoided\u201d (On the Ten Commandments [Collationes in\ndecem praeceptis] proem).\n\nSo described, natural law might be nothing more than an innate\ninclination to accept a fixed set of moral laws prescribed by God. In\nfact, however, Aquinas\u2019s theory offers something more complex\nand nuanced, because he thinks the moral law arises not out of brutely\ninnate inclination but out of rational reflection on the good (Finnis\n1998 ch. 3; Rhonheimer 1987 [2000]). Mirroring the way he develops\ntheoretical science out of first principles (\u00a76.3), he thinks\nmoral reasoning also rises out of self-evident first principles, the\ngrasp of which is the defining task of the intellect\u2019s power of\nsynderesis (ST 1a 79.12). The most fundamental such precept\nis this:\n\nThe good should be done and pursued, and the bad should be avoided.\n(ST 1a2ae 94.2c)\n\n\nAquinas takes this to be self-evident, because he accepts\nAristotle\u2019s claim at the start of the Nicomachean\nEthics that the good is what all things desire. By beginning\nhere, Aquinas builds into the ground floor of his account a\nsubstantive story about\n moral motivation.\n The story requires tying the ensuing development of his theory to\nfacts about what human beings actually desire; without that tie, the\ntheory would equivocate on what it means by the good. Aquinas\nexplicitly recognizes as much, remarking that \u201cthe order of the\nprecepts of natural law accords with the order of natural\ninclinations\u201d (ST 1a2ae 94.2c). At this point, Aquinas\ncould appeal to eudaimonism: that all human beings desire happiness as\ntheir ultimate end (\u00a78.1). A very thin conception of natural law\nmight suppose that human beings are given only this much innate\ndirection, and thereafter left to sort out for themselves what will\nmake them happy. But Aquinas\u2019s conception of natural law is much\nthicker, both in the sense that he articulates a rich and substantive\nnotion of the happiness that is our ultimate end (as above), and in\nthe sense that he thinks we have been given various further innate\ninclinations, intended to provide us with specific guidance toward\nthat ultimate end. Among these are inclinations to preserve our own\nlives, toward sexual activity, toward educating the young, toward\nknowing the truth about God, and toward living in society (ST\n1a2ae 94.2c; see also SCG III.129). These innate\ninclinations, combined with the first practical principle (\u201cThe\ngood should be done\u2026\u201d) and Aquinas\u2019s substantive\nconception of happiness, are the foundations from which arises a\ncomprehensive account of the moral law, relying on\n conscience\n as the rational activity of working out what ought to be done from a\nmoral point of view (ST 1a 79.13).\n\nInasmuch as the moral point of view is no different from the point of\nview that seeks our own happiness, Aquinas shares with ancient ethics\nthe conviction that rational self-interest provides an adequate\nfoundation for morality (Irwin 2007: ch. 19). But the weight Aquinas\nputs on our innate inclinations in shaping the moral law gives his\naccount a distinctive character. Among its champions, this approach\nhas been celebrated for the way it grounds traditional values in facts\nabout human nature. To its critics, the view looks intellectually\ndubious twice over: on scientific grounds inasmuch as it makes false\nclaims about the universality of various inclinations (Massey 1999);\nand philosophically inasmuch as it grounds\n normativity in metaethics\n on descriptive facts about human nature. Such criticisms, however,\nmiss the philosophical sophistication of the overarching framework. To\nbe sure, we now understand the diversity of human\ninclinations\u2014for instance, regarding gender and\nsexuality\u2014much better than we did even a century ago.\nAquinas\u2019s theory can survive when we update these assumptions,\nand indeed may generate surprisingly modern results (Oliva 2015). As\nfor the complaint that the theory conflates normativity with nature,\nthat would have real force only supposing that we had some better\naccount of the basis of normative value. As things are, if there is a\nGod, then it seems plausible to suppose that God would want us to be\nhappy and would create our natures to guide us in seeking such\nhappiness. On the other hand, if there is no God, then it is not clear\nwhat foundation for ethics there might be other than facts about the\nnature of human beings and how we best thrive in the world we live in.\n(The literature on the natural law in Aquinas is large and\ncontentious. For a sample see Grisez 1965; Lisska 1996; Murphy 2001;\nJensen 2015; Porter 2018. For an introduction to the variety of recent\nperspectives see Angier 2021. For a sense of the complexity of the\ncontested issues see\n Aquinas\u2019 moral, political, and legal philosophy.)\n",
