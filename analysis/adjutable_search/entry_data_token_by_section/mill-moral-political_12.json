    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Liberalism\n3. Mill\u2019s Liberalism\n\nMill\u2019s On Liberty is the most influential statement of\nhis liberal principles. He begins by distinguishing old and new\nthreats to liberty. The old threat to liberty is found in traditional\nsocieties in which there is rule by one (a monarchy) or a few (an\n aristocracy).[1]\n Though one could be worried about restrictions on liberty by\nbenevolent monarchs or aristocrats, the traditional worry is that when\nrulers are politically unaccountable to the governed they will rule in\ntheir own interests, rather than the interests of the governed. In\nparticular, they will restrict the liberties of their subjects in ways\nthat benefit themselves, rather than the ruled. It was these\ntraditional threats to liberty that the democratic reforms of the\nPhilosophical Radicals were meant to address. But Mill thinks that\nthese traditional threats to liberty are not the only ones to worry\nabout. He makes clear that democracies contain their own threats to\nliberty\u2014this is the tyranny, not of the one or the few, but of\nthe majority (OL I 1\u20135).  Mill sets out to articulate\nthe principles that should regulate how governments and societies,\nwhether democratic or not, can restrict individual liberties (I\n6).\n",
