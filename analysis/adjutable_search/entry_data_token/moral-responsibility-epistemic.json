The\nfirst condition has to do with whether the agent possessed an adequate\ndegree of control or freedom in performing the action, whereas the\nsecond condition is concerned with whether the agent\u2019s epistemic\nor cognitive state was such that she can properly be held accountable\nfor the action and its consequences.

The Epistemic Condition\n1.1 Contents of Awareness\n\nWe can start with this intuitive thought: for an agent to be\npraise-/blameworthy for an action, she must be aware of certain\nthings. Thus, what the EC seems to require, at least initially, is\nawareness. As we will see, the debate revolves around three main\nissues. First, what the content of the requisite awareness\nis, i.e., of which things an agent needs to be aware of. Second, what\nkind of awareness is required, i.e., which mental states are\ninvolved and in what way these mental states must be entertained.\nThird, whether awareness is actually required at all or whether there\ncan be, in Sher\u2019s (2009) phrase, \u201cresponsibility without\nawareness\u201d. For the moment we can bracket the third question and\npursue the intuitive thought that responsibility does require\nawareness. In this subsection we focus on the question about the\ncontent of awareness and in the next one on the question about the\nkind of awareness relevant for moral responsibility.\n\nImagine that John presses a wall button that activates a treadmill in\nwhich Mary is standing still, causing her to fall to the ground and\nbreak an arm. Let\u2019s assume that the action is objectively wrong,\nsince it harmed Mary for no good reason, e.g., to save her from an\nincoming bullet. Now let\u2019s try to determine what it would take\nfor John to be blameworthy for it. Assume first that John satisfies\nall non-epistemic conditions on moral responsibility, like possessing\nwhatever kind of freedom/control is required for blameworthiness. Now\nask: of which things must John be aware at the time of action in order\nto be blameworthy for it and for the ensuing consequences? There are\nfour plausible epistemic requirements involved: awareness of action,\nof moral significance, of consequences, and of alternatives.\nWe\u2019ll take them in turn.\n\nFirst, the requirement of awareness of action (Mele 2010;\nSliwa 2017). To be responsible for his action, John must be aware of\nwhat he is doing. If John falsely believes that the button is a light\nswitch, then he isn\u2019t aware that by pressing it he will start\nthe treadmill and so it seems that he can\u2019t be blamed for\nMary\u2019s fall and for her injuries. Similarly, if John correctly\nbelieves that pressing the button will start the treadmill but\nisn\u2019t aware that Mary is standing on it, it seems that he\nisn\u2019t blameworthy either. These seemings have to be refined, of\ncourse, since John\u2019s ignorance of the button\u2019s function or\nof Mary\u2019s location can itself be blameworthy, in which case\n(most think) it fails to exculpate (Ginet 2000: 271). (For the classic\ndiscussion of what it takes for ignorance to be culpable see Holly\nSmith 1983 and\n sect. 2\n below. For discussions of whether culpable ignorance excuses, see\nHolly Smith 1983 and 2017; Montmarquet 1995.) The lesson, then, is\nthat for an agent to be directly blameworthy for an\naction\u2014that is, blameworthy in a way that doesn\u2019t derive\nfrom previous instances of blameworthiness, such as culpability for\nthe ignorance from which she acts\u2014she must be aware that she is\nperforming the action in question, and be aware of it under an\nappropriate description (Anscombe 1963; Levy 2014: 37). In this case,\nJohn must be aware that by pressing the button he is activating the\ntreadmill with Mary on it or, alternatively, that by pressing the\nbutton and activating the treadmill he is causing Mary to fall to the\nground. (Recall that this is just a first pass on the epistemic\nrequirements on responsibility. We\u2019ll see later on\n (sect. 3.4)\n that many philosophers deny that one must be aware of what one is\ndoing in order to be directly responsible for it.)\n\nSecond, the requirement of awareness of moral significance.\nFor John to be blameworthy, he has to be aware of the action\u2019s\nmoral significance or moral valence. In other words, he must have a\nbelief about the action\u2019s being wrong or, alternatively, a\nbelief about the presence of whatever features make the action wrong\n(its wrong-making features). The first kind of belief amounts to\nde dicto awareness of moral significance, because it involves\nawareness of the action\u2019s wrongness so conceived (Haji\n1997: 543; Zimmerman 2002a; 2008: 191\u20132; 2017: 85; Rosen 2004:\n307; Levy 2011: 141; Sliwa 2017: 131\u20132). The second kind of\nbelief amounts to de re awareness of moral significance,\nbecause it involves awareness of those features of the action that are\nin fact morally significant, regardless of whether the agent\nis also aware of the moral significance they actually have\n(Harman 2011: 465; 2015: 59\u201360, 67; Talbert 2013: 242;\nLittlejohn 2014: 144; Levy 2014: 37). If when John presses the button\nhe entertains the belief that what he is doing is overall morally\nwrong, he has de dicto awareness of the action\u2019s moral\nsignificance. (If, alternatively, he believes that his action is\nmerely pro tanto morally wrong but not wrong\nall-things-considered, he lacks that awareness.) If, on the other\nhand, John lacks the belief about overall wrongness but has other\nbeliefs about the action\u2019s wrong-making features, e.g., that it\nwill harm Mary, he has de re awareness of the action\u2019s\nmoral significance. The position according to which the relevant\nawareness is de dicto awareness entails that moral knowledge\n(or at least moral beliefs) is necessary for responsibility (Sliwa\n2017), whereas the position according to which the relevant awareness\nis de re awareness denies the necessity of moral knowledge\n(Harman 2011 & 2015; Talbert 2013; Weatherson 2019: ch. 5).\nWe\u2019ll see below\n (sect. 3.3)\n that this is a key dispute concerning the epistemic requirements on\npraise-/blameworthiness.\n\nThird, the requirement of awareness of consequences. In a\nnatural description of the case, we would say that John is responsible\nfor Mary\u2019s breaking an arm, that is, that he\u2019s blameworthy\nfor the latter\n event.[2]\n Call this the consequence of John\u2019s action. What kind of\nawareness is required for John to be blameworthy for it? The\nstraightforward response is that he must have a belief about the event\noccurring as a result of his action (Zimmerman 1997: 420). However,\nthere is disagreement about what the content of this belief must be.\nSome philosophers (Zimmerman 1986; Vargas 2005) think that it must be\nvery specific, in the sense that the agent has to believe that an\nevent of exactly the kind that occurred could result from her\naction, whereas others (Fischer & Tognazzini 2009; King 2017: 272;\nNelkin & Rickless 2017a: 126) think that a belief with a more\ngeneral content suffices. According to the former position, for John\nto be blameworthy for the consequence of his action he must have\nentertained the belief that Mary would (or might) break her arm as a\nresult of her fall, whereas according to the latter position a belief\nthat someone would (or might) be harmed is enough. It\u2019s worth\nnoting that the requirement of awareness of consequences is usually\nstated in terms of \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d rather than\nactual foresight (Vargas 2005; Fischer & Tognazzini 2009; Sartorio\n2017; cf. Zimmerman 1986; Nelkin & Rickless 2017a). As will become\npatent later on, the dispute about how to understand this requirement\nis part and parcel of the broader dispute about whether the EC\nrequires occurrent awareness\n (sect. 2)\n or, rather, the capacity to gain the requisite awareness (sects.\n 3.2,\n 3.4).\n\nFourth and finally, the requirement of awareness of\nalternatives. Some philosophers argue that an agent can\u2019t\nbe blameworthy for a wrong action unless she believes that there is at\nleast one alternative (and permissible) course of action open to her.\nFor instance, Levy writes (see also Wieland 2017a: 2; Guerrero 2007:\n89):\n\n\nPerhaps it need not be the case \u2026 that agents need genuine\naccess to alternative possibilities when they choose and act, but they\ndo need epistemic access to a range of alternatives: they can\nonly appropriately be blamed for performing an action if they believed\nthat alternatives were available to them, and understood the\nsignificance of these alternatives. (Levy 2011: 111)\n\n\nApplying this idea to our example, John would be blameworthy only if\nhe believed that he could have pursued an alternative and permissible\ncourse of action, such as refraining from pressing the button.\nHowever, not everyone agrees that this is a genuine epistemic\nrequirement on responsibility. For instance, Sartorio (2017)\nargues\u2014on the basis of a variation on the classic Frankfurt\ncases (Frankfurt 1969)\u2014that an agent can be blameworthy even if\nshe believes, or even knows, that she couldn\u2019t have\ndone otherwise, as long as this belief doesn\u2019t interfere with\nher own deliberation about whether to perform the wrong action.\n\nIn sum, there are four different things awareness of which seems (at\nleast initially) relevant for responsibility: awareness of one\u2019s\naction under an appropriate description, of its moral significance, of\nits potential consequences, and of alternatives to it. Next\nwe\u2019ll consider different positions about what mental states\namount to the requisite awareness.\n1.2 Kinds of Awareness\n\nIn the previous section we identified several plausible epistemic\nrequirements on moral responsibility. They constitute the\ncontent of the awareness that, at least initially, seems to\nbe demanded by the EC. Now we\u2019ll focus on the kind of\nawareness that is in question. We\u2019ll pursue two questions.\nFirst, what mental states must the agent entertain in order\nto possess the relevant awareness? Second, how must the\nmental states in question be entertained (occurrently,\ndispositionally, etc.)?\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the first question. It was pointed out at the\noutset that one of the alternative labels for the EC is\n\u2018knowledge condition\u2019 and this may naturally suggest that\nawareness in this context is nothing but knowledge. Returning to the\nexample, this would mean that John satisfies the EC just in case he\nknew what he was doing and knew about its moral\nsignificance, its potential consequences, etc. However, many\nphilosophers have argued that knowledge proper isn\u2019t required\nfor blameworthiness (Rosen 2008: 596; Haji 2008: 90; Peels 2014:\n493\u20134; Baron 2017: 58\u20139). To see why, consider this case\npresented by Rosen:\n\n\nDorfman poisons Mrs. Dorfman by putting what he takes to be arsenic in\nher tea. The stuff is indeed arsenic and Mrs. Dorfman dies as planned.\nBut Dorfman does not know that the stuff is arsenic (or that\nhis act subjects his victim to an unjustifiable risk of death)\nbecause: The chemist who sold Dorfman the arsenic is a famous liar\n\u2026 [G]iven the chemist\u2019s well-known track record of\nselling sugar as arsenic to would-be poisoners, Dorfman had no\nbusiness believing him. Dorfman\u2019s pertinent beliefs are true,\nbut they do not amount to knowledge because they are based on\ninsufficient evidence. (Rosen 2008: 596)\n\n\nThe key point is that Dorfman\u2019s lack of knowledge about the\nwrong-making features of his action is irrelevant for assessing his\nblameworthiness, for he is as blameworthy as he would be had he knew\nthat the stuff was indeed arsenic. Therefore, whatever mental state\nDorfman was in at the time of carrying out his plan, it must suffice\nfor satisfying the EC. It\u2019s natural to think that the relevant\nmental state is simply true belief (Peels 2014: 493). Dorfman truly\nbelieved that he was pouring arsenic into her wife\u2019s tea and\nthat by doing so she would die, and this seems enough for him to be\nblameworthy (assuming he also satisfied other non-epistemic conditions\non responsibility). Some philosophers think that mere true belief\nisn\u2019t enough, though, and claim that what is needed for\nsatisfying the EC is reasonable or justified belief\ninstead (Timpe 2011: 18; Ginet 2000: 270). This would entail that\nDorfman satisfies the EC only if it was reasonable for him to believe,\nor if he was justified in believing, that what the chemist handed over\nto him was indeed arsenic and thus that he would poison his wife by\npouring the substance in her tea (perhaps it was reasonable and\njustified if Dorfman had never heard about the chemist\u2019s\nreputation as a liar).\n\nHowever, still other philosophers think that not only the belief in\nquestion needn\u2019t be reasonable, but that it needn\u2019t even\nbe true (Zimmerman 2008: 198; Haji 1997: 526; Levy 2014: 36).\nOn this view,\n\n\nblameworthiness is affiliated not with the objective wrongness of an\naction but with whether a person takes herself to be doing wrong in\nperforming an action. (Haji 1997: 526)\n\n\nThis entails that an agent can be blameworthy for performing a morally\nneutral, or even a morally right action (Zimmerman 2008: 201),\nprovided that she acts on the belief that her action is wrong (see the\ncase of Huckleberry Finn in\n sect. 3.3\n below). In defense of this position, it has been argued that there is\na particular kind of culpability that one incurs when one knowingly\ndefies what one takes to be the requirements of morality (Levy 2011:\n142; Zimmerman 2017: 91), regardless of whether one gets them\nright.\n\nAssuming that awareness involves some or another type of belief,\nlet\u2019s turn now to the second question broached above, namely\nhow these beliefs must be entertained for the person to\npossess the relevant awareness. The main dispute here is between those\nphilosophers who think that the pertinent beliefs must be\noccurrently entertained (Zimmerman 1997: 421\u20132; 2017:\n79; Ginet 2000: 270; Rosen 2004: 309; Levy 2011: 141) and those who\nthink that it\u2019s enough if these beliefs are\ndispositionally entertained (Haji 1997: 531; Peels 2011: 580;\nTimpe 2011: 18; Levy 2013: 167; 2014:\n 34).[3]\n According to the \u2018occurrentist\u2019 camp, an agent satisfies\nthe EC only if, at the time of action, she consciously believes that\nher action is right/wrong and consciously contemplates some of its\npossible consequences (Zimmerman 1997: 421). Otherwise, and for the\npurposes of attributions of responsibility, she is ignorant of\nrelevant considerations and so, in principle (recall the possibility\nof culpable ignorance), she has an excuse for her wrongdoing\n(Zimmerman 2017: 79; see\n sect. 3.1\n below for an argument in favor of this position). As we\u2019ll see\nbelow\n (sect. 2),\n the occurrentist interpretation of the EC plays a central role in a\nrevisionist argument against commonsense attributions of\nresponsibility.\n\nBy contrast, the \u2018dispositionalist\u2019 camp argues that the\noccurrentist interpretation of the EC is too strict and would let too\nmany intuitively blameworthy wrongdoers off the hook. For one, if one\nforgets a relevant piece of information and as a consequence does\nsomething wrong\u2014if, say, one forgets about the dietary\nrestrictions of the infant one is babysitting and then feeds her food\nto which she is allergic\u2014one seems to be, absent excusing\nconditions, blameworthy (Peels 2011: 580; see also Husak 2011).\nCrucially, however, lack of occurrent belief concerning the relevant\ninformation doesn\u2019t seem to be one of those excusing conditions\n(Amaya & Doris 2015: 267). Also, if the occurrentist position were\nright, one could shield oneself from blame simply by avoid thinking\nabout the moral status of one\u2019s action, and that\u2019s\nimplausible (Guerrero 2007: 74; Timpe 2011: 23; Robichaud 2014: 150;\nLevy 2014: 31). These considerations lead to the position that tacit,\ndormant, dispositional, or unconscious beliefs can, at least in many\ncases, amount to the kind of awareness that is required for moral\nresponsibility (see\n sect. 3.1\n below for more arguments in favor of this position).\n2. The Epistemic Condition and Revisionism\n\nSo far we have pursued the intuitive idea that responsibility requires\nawareness and reviewed several positions concerning the content and\nkind of awareness that is in question. We\u2019ll now see that this\nintuitive idea, coupled with a particular interpretation of the\ncontent and kind of the requisite awareness, leads to a regress that\nthreatens to undermine attributions of responsibility quite generally.\nThe following argument is originally due to Zimmerman (1997), who\noffered slight variations in his 2008 and 2017. Rosen (2004) and Levy\n(2011: ch. 5) have also advanced versions of it, as well as Ginet\n(2000), although the latter fails to note its revisionist\nimplications. We\u2019ll call the proponents of this argument\n\u2018volitionists\u2019, and the position they espouse concerning\nthe EC \u2018revisionism\u2019. The volitionists\u2019 argument\nsparked a big debate in which the three central questions concerning\nthe EC mentioned at the outset\u2014about the content, kind, and\nnecessity of awareness\u2014have been thoroughly explored. This\nsection presents a reconstruction of the regress argument and the next\none presents the main responses to it.\n\nTo appreciate how the regress is generated, consider the variation of\nour initial example in which John falsely believes that the wall\nbutton is a light switch. Since John isn\u2019t aware that by\npressing the button he is activating the treadmill, he fails to\nsatisfy the requirement of awareness of action under an appropriate\ndescription and, a fortiori, he also fails to satisfy the\nrequirements concerning awareness of moral significance and of\nconsequences. Therefore, since John is unaware that pressing the\nbutton is wrong (or, alternatively, unaware of the action\u2019s\nwrong-making features) and is also unaware of the potential\nconsequences of doing so, we may think that, at least in principle, he\nis blameworthy neither for his action nor for Mary\u2019s injuries.\nJohn\u2019s unawareness or, as it\u2019s often put, John\u2019s\nignorance would play the role of an excuse for his\nwrongdoing, where an excuse is a consideration that blocks the\nattribution of blame to an agent who has performed a wrong action\n(Austin 1957 [1962]; Kelly 2012; Franklin 2013. For detailed\ndiscussions of the ignorance excuse see Rosen 2008; Peels 2014; Baron\n2017). As it was noted above, however, John\u2019s ignorance can\nitself be blameworthy or culpable, and it\u2019s\nwidely\u2014although not universally (cf. Holly Smith 2017; Ross\n1939: 163\u20134)\u2014accepted that culpable ignorance fails to\nexculpate (at least completely). Thus, it if turns out that John is\nculpable for his ignorance of the button\u2019s true function, he\nmight well be blameworthy for unwittingly activating the treadmill and\nfor unwittingly causing Mary\u2019s injuries. Notice that if this\nwere the case, John\u2019s blameworthiness for his unwitting action\nand its consequences would be derivative (or\nindirect) rather than original (or direct):\nit would derive from a prior instance of blameworthiness, namely his\nblameworthiness for his ignorant state (Zimmerman 1997: 414\u20135;\nRosen 2004: 300). (See King 2017 for criticism of the idea that\nblameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing must be explained in terms of\nthe original/derivative distinction, and see Wieland and Robichaud\n2017 for a thorough discussion of different ways of cashing out the\nidea that there is a \u201ctransfer\u201d of blame in these\ncases.)\n\nSo now the crucial question becomes: What would it take for John to be\nblameworthy for his ignorance? John\u2019s ignorance of the fact that\nhis action is wrong is rooted in his mistaken belief that the button\nis a light switch, so it seems that if he is blameworthy for his\nignorance it must be because he is blameworthy for having this belief\nor for lacking the correct belief about the button\u2019s\n function.[4]\n So what would it take for John to be blameworthy for having certain\nbeliefs or lacking others? In answering this question volitionists\nappeal to the thesis of doxastic involuntarism, according to which we\nlack direct control over our beliefs, that is, we can\u2019t decide\nat will what to believe (Williams 1973; Alston 1988; Zimmerman 2002a;\nRosen 2004: 302; Levy 2007; 2011: 128\u201331). So if John is\nblameworthy for having or lacking certain beliefs, this must be\nbecause there was something John did such that: i) he had\ndirect control over it; ii) it caused him to have or lack certain\nbeliefs; iii) doing such a thing is all-things-considered wrong; and\niv) he is blameworthy for having done it. (Notice that, on this view,\nresponsibility for ignorance is also derivative.) The natural\ncandidate that satisfies clauses i to iii is what Holly Smith (1983)\ncalls a \u201cbenighting act\u201d: an action or omission the\nconsequence of which is the lack of a true belief about the\nimpermissibility of one\u2019s conduct. In other words, by performing\na benighting act the agent brings about her own ignorance about the\nwrongness of her subsequent action. In our example we can imagine\nseveral benighting acts John may have performed, such as discarding\n(without reading it first) the operational booklet that was given to\nhim when he was hired at the fitness center, not asking a colleague to\nshow him around before touching anything, not reading the conspicuous\n\u201cCaution: activates treadmill\u201d sign placed above the\nbutton, etc.\n\nAny of these actions and omissions satisfies clauses i to iii above:\ni) John has direct control over keeping (and reading) a booklet or\nreading a sign or asking questions; ii) John\u2019s failure to\nperform at least one of these actions caused him to lack a true belief\nabout the button\u2019s function; and iii) any of these actions and\nomissions is, in the relevant context, all-things-considered wrong,\nsince John was under a \u2018procedural epistemic obligation\u2019\n(Rosen 2004: 301) to inform himself about the functioning of the\nplace. Wrongness, however, isn\u2019t the same as blameworthiness, so\nwe still need to know (clause iv) if John is blameworthy for any of\nthese benighting acts (H. Smith 1983: 548). The natural thought at\nthis point is that culpability for a benighting act requires exactly\nthe same as culpability for any other act (Zimmerman 1997: 416).\nTherefore, if we started from the idea that responsibility requires\nawareness, we\u2019ll conclude that one is blameworthy for a\nbenighting act only if, at the time of performing it, one is aware of\nwhat one is doing, of its moral significance, of its potential\nconsequences, and of alternatives to it. This entails that John is\nblameworthy for any of the benighting acts described above only if\neither he performed any of them in full awareness (including awareness\nof the probable consequence of leaving him ignorant of relevant\nconsiderations) or, if this wasn\u2019t the case, he is in\nturn blameworthy for this further lack of awareness.\n\nIt becomes clear at this point that in trying to establish\nJohn\u2019s blameworthiness for the original action we are facing a\nregress. John would be blameworthy for his unwittingly activating the\ntreadmill and its consequences only if his ignorance of the\nbutton\u2019s function was itself culpable, which in turn requires\nthat such ignorance derives from a culpable action or\nomission (a benighting act). But culpability for a benighting act\nagain seems to require awareness, so if John\u2019s omissions to\ninform himself were also unwitting\u2014if he was also ignorant or\nunaware of the need to read the operational booklet, say\u2014we\nwould need to search for further benighting acts to which we\ncould trace back this extra piece of ignorance. For the regress to\nterminate, the agent\u2019s ignorance must be at some point the\ncausal upshot of an action or omission performed in full awareness of\nall the relevant facts (including the relevant moral facts.\nSee below). As Rosen puts it,\n\n\nHe would have to know the pertinent facts about his contemplated act.\nHe would have to know that it was wrong. And he would have to know\nthat in the circumstances, all things considered, he should not do it.\nHe would then have to act despite this knowledge. (Rosen 2004:\n307)\n\n\nAn action performed in this way would be an akratic action,\nthat is, an action performed while occurrently and de dicto\n(Rosen 2004: 309) believing that it\u2019s all-things-considered\nwrong to do it. It thus follows from the regress argument that\n\u201cthe only possible locus of original responsibility is an\nakratic act\u201d (Rosen 2004: 307), and this entails that every\nblameworthy action must be either itself an akratic action or the\ncausal upshot of one (Zimmerman [2008: 176] calls the second disjunct\n\u2018the Origination Thesis\u2019). This is the \u2018akrasia\nrequirement\u2019 on blameworthiness defended by volitionists. The\nakrasia requirement is a surprising result with troubling revisionist\nimplications, because when we make ordinary judgments of\nblameworthiness we rarely (if ever) check to see whether it is met\n(Zimmerman 2017: 84). According to the argument, however, we should,\nfor if it isn\u2019t met attributions of blame are mistaken. And the\nproblem isn\u2019t merely that the soundness of the argument would\nforce us to take extra steps before blaming others; rather, the\nproblem is that it can be speculated that ignorant wrongdoing very\nrarely has such non-ignorant (or akratic) origins (Zimmerman 1997:\n418; Levy 2011: 131). Moreover, it has been argued that it would be\nvery difficult, or even impossible, for us to ascertain whether the\nakrasia requirement has been met on any particular occasion (Rosen\n2004: 308). In either case, the upshot is that many, perhaps most, of\nour ordinary judgments of blameworthiness for ignorant wrongdoing are\nunwarranted.\n\nAnd indeed things can get worse, for volitionists claim that this\nargument applies to all kinds of ignorance, not just factual\nignorance as in John\u2019s example (Zimmerman 1997: 423; Rosen 2003;\n2004: 304; Levy 2011:\n 118\u201323).[5]\n Consider a variant of the case in which John is aware that pressing\nthe button will activate the treadmill and foresees as well that doing\nso might cause Mary to fall and sustain an injury (and even intends\nthis to be the case). But suppose that John doesn\u2019t believe, and\nso isn\u2019t aware, that harming Mary is wrong, perhaps because he\nwas raised in an extremely sexist society in which it\u2019s widely\nassumed that men are allowed to harm women in response to perceived\nthreats to their manhood (think of the many places in which\n\u2018honor killings\u2019 against women are still considered\nacceptable). In this variant, John acts from moral ignorance,\nnot factual ignorance, and yet volitionists claim that since John is\nunaware that what he\u2019s doing is wrong, the argument applies to\nhim in this variant as well: he is blameworthy for his action only if\nhe is blameworthy for his (moral) ignorance, and he is blameworthy for\nthe latter only if it derives from a blameworthy benighting act, such\nas knowingly refusing to question his sexist beliefs. If these\nconditions aren\u2019t met, volitionists claim that John is excused,\nbecause according to them non-culpable ignorance, be it factual or\nmoral, always exculpate. This is what Rosen (2003) calls the\n\u2018Parity Thesis\u2019. (Husak 2016 offers a book-length defense\nof the idea that legal ignorance also excuses, which has\nseveral points in common with the volitionists\u2019 position. See\nYaffe 2018 for criticism.)\n\nRosen (2004: 305\u20136; see also Levy 2011: 141) even claims that if\nan agent is aware that her contemplated act is morally wrong but fails\nto believe that it\u2019s all-things-considered wrong,\nperhaps because she believes that sometimes self-interest trumps\nmorality, she also acts from ignorance (in this case, ignorance of\n\u2018the rational force of moral considerations\u2019), which means\nthat the regress argument also applies to her. Thus, volitionists\nthink that ignorant wrongdoing is extremely widespread\n(especially because they think that lack of occurrent belief counts as\nignorance), and this is why the regress argument applies to all\nwrongdoers except for akratic ones. Therefore, the argument ultimately\nthreatens to undermine attributions of responsibility quite\n generally.[6]\n\nIt seems to most philosophers that something has gone awry at this\npoint, for (the assumption seems to be) it can\u2019t be the case\nthat the requirements of the EC are so stringent that most ordinary\nwrongdoers, particularly morally ignorant ones (Schnall 2004:\n308), fail to meet them and so turn out to be blameless after all\n(FitzPatrick 2008: 610; Peels 2011: 578; Clarke 2014: 162). The\nchallenge is to articulate what exactly is wrong with the regress\nargument. It will be useful to spell out its four main theses:\n\nDerivative Blameworthiness for Actions. An agent is\nblameworthy for a wrongful action performed out of ignorance only if\n(and because) she is culpable for the ignorance from which she\n acts.[7]\nDerivative Blameworthiness for Ignorance. Ignorance is\nculpable only if it derives from a benighting act performed in full\nawareness.\nAwareness. Relevant awareness (for ordinary actions and\nbenighting acts) involves occurrent and de dicto beliefs\nabout the action\u2019s overall wrongness.\nParity. Theses i and ii apply to all kinds of\nignorance.\n\n\nIn the next section we\u2019ll survey the main responses to the\nregress argument. Each of these responses denies one or more of the\nargument\u2019s main theses and, in so doing, develop alternative\ninterpretations of the EC. (See Wieland 2017a for another presentation\nof the competing positions in this debate.)\n3. Responses to Revisionism\n\nVolitionists argue that the intuitive thought that responsibility\nrequires awareness, pursued to its ultimate consequences, subverts\nordinary judgments of blameworthiness. So, in order to respond to the\nrevisionist interpretation of the EC, that intuitive thought needs to\nbe reexamined. Responses to revisionism vary according to how much\nthey are willing to depart from it. Some philosophers agree that\nresponsibility requires awareness, but argue that the requisite\nawareness doesn\u2019t necessarily involve an occurrent\nbelief concerning the action\u2019s overall wrongness\n (sect. 3.1,\n \u2018Weakened internalism\u2019). Other philosophers claim that,\nwhile awareness of wrongdoing is required for culpability for actions,\nsuch awareness isn\u2019t required when it comes to assessing\nculpability for ignorance itself\n (sect. 3.2,\n \u2018Ignorance and epistemic vices\u2019). A third group maintains\nthat the required awareness concerns only the factual aspects of\none\u2019s action, not the moral ones, at least not conceived in a\nde dicto way\n (sect. 3.3,\n \u2018Quality of will\u2019). Finally, some philosophers contend\nthat in certain cases awareness isn\u2019t required at all: agents\ncan be blameworthy for fully unwitting acts provided that certain\nother conditions are met\n (sect. 3.4,\n \u2018Capacitarianism\u2019). Despite their differences, what these\npositions have in common is the goal of denying the akrasia\nrequirement on blameworthiness.\n3.1 Weakened Internalism\n\nThe most conservative strategy for attacking the revisionist\ninterpretation of the EC accepts the bulk of the regress argument\n(theses i, ii and iv) but denies that occurrent awareness of\nwrongdoing (that is, clear-eyed akrasia) is necessary for\nblameworthiness (thesis iii). According to this position, a weaker\nkind of awareness\u2014constituted by dispositional,\ndormant, tacit, or unconscious beliefs\u2014is all that the EC\nrequires (Haji 1997; Peels 2011; Timpe 2011; Husak 2011; Levy 2013\n& 2014: ch. 2; Nelkin & Rickless 2017a: 127). Other proponents\nof this strategy deny that the content of the requisite\nawareness must involve a belief in the action\u2019s overall\nwrongness and claim that a belief in there being sufficient reasons\nnot to perform the action (Robichaud 2014), a belief in one\u2019s\nacting from morally reproachable reasons (Sartorio 2017), or a belief\nin there being a non-negligible risk that one\u2019s action is wrong\n(Guerrero 2007; Nelkin & Rickless 2017a), can be enough for\nblameworthiness. (See also Levy 2014 [ch. 2] who claims that\nresponsibility requires awareness of the facts that give the\naction its moral valence rather than awareness of moral wrongness. Cf.\nLevy 2011 [ch. 6, esp. 141] and\n fn. 3\n above.) We\u2019ll call this position \u2018weakened\ninternalism\u2019: \u2018internalism\u2019 because, like\nvolitionism, it assumes that what the EC requires is the presence of\ncertain mental states that track the action\u2019s moral valence as\nit appears to the agent (Levy 2009); \u2018weakened\u2019 because,\nunlike volitionism, it allows for the possibility that non-occurrent\nmental states, as well as beliefs that fall short of full-blown\nakrasia, satisfy the EC.\n\nIn defense of the volitionist position, Zimmerman offers this\nargument:\n\n\nif a belief is not occurrent, then one cannot act either with the\nintention to heed the belief or with the intention not to heed it; if\none has no such intention, then one cannot act either deliberately on\nor deliberately despite the belief; if this is so, then the belief\nplays no role in the reason for which one performs one\u2019s action;\nand one incurs culpability for one\u2019s action only if one\u2019s\nbelief concerning wrongdoing plays a role in the reason for which one\nperforms the action. (1997: 421\u20132)\n\n\nIn reply, the weakened internalist argues that it\u2019s false that\nonly occurrent beliefs play a role in the reasons for which one acts,\nand so it\u2019s false that an occurrent belief concerning wrongdoing\nis necessary for knowingly doing wrong (Peels 2011: 581\u20132). Take\na non-moral example first: one can decide to go to the park because\none occurrently believes that a break from work is in order, while\nalso (albeit dispositionally) believing that the park is a nice place,\nthat one\u2019s friends frequently gather at the park, that there are\noften amusing performances taking place there, etc. All these beliefs\ncan play a role in the reasons for which one decides to go to the\npark, even though they are dispositional rather than occurrent.\nSomething similar holds in cases of wrongdoing: returning to our\nexample, suppose that while John is preparing his attack on Mary, the\nonly beliefs he occurrently holds concern various aspects of his plan\nand ways of carrying it out undetected. Still, he may hold the\ndispositional belief that what he is planning to do is wrong and, just\nas in the park example, this belief can play a role in the reasons for\nwhich he does wrong (for instance, John may decide to proceed with\nthis plan despite dispositionally believing it\u2019s wrong to do\nso). It thus seems that John is blameworthy despite his belief about\nwrongdoing not being occurrent (Timpe 2011: 23; Levy 2014: 31). If\nthis is correct, then clear-eyed akrasia isn\u2019t necessary for\nblameworthiness.\n\nThis contention can be bolstered by appealing to cases of\nself-deception (Haji 1997: 537\u20139). Suppose that Susan is\ndeliberating whether to pay her taxes. Lately she has been spending\nsignificant amounts of time with some libertarian (in the political\nsense) friends who try to convince her that she has no obligation to\npay taxes because the government is illegitimate. Susan doesn\u2019t\nfind their arguments very convincing, but her strong desire to fit in\nleads her to form a conscious judgment that she shouldn\u2019t pay\nher taxes. At the same time, however, she has an unconscious or\ndispositional belief that it\u2019s all-things-considered wrong not\nto pay taxes. If Susan ends up not paying taxes, it seems correct to\nsay that she did so despite her (dispositional) belief that\nher omission is all-things-considered wrong. So this belief did play a\nrole in the reasons for which she acted, even though it was merely\ndispositional (recall that, according to Zimmerman, a belief plays a\nrole in one\u2019s reasons if one either acts on the belief\nor despite the belief). Susan was \u201cunconsciously\naware\u201d (Haji 1997: 544) that not paying taxes is wrong and this,\naccording to the weakened internalist, suffices for satisfying the\nrequirement of awareness of moral significance and thus for Susan to\nbe blameworthy. So, once again, clear-eyed akrasia isn\u2019t\nnecessary for blameworthiness. On the further assumption that\ndispositional beliefs about wrongdoing are much more common than\noccurrent ones, the weakened internalist position would have shown\nthat the revisionist consequences of the regress argument aren\u2019t\nas severe as originally thought.\n\nAnother line of argument exploited by weakened internalists denies\nthat the content of the requisite awareness must involve a\nbelief in the action\u2019s overall wrongness. For instance, Guerrero\n(2007: 78) argues that if an agent is unsure whether the action she is\nplanning to undertake is permissible or not, and so admits the\npossibility that it might well be wrong, she can be\nblameworthy for carrying it out even in the absence of clear-eyed\nakrasia and even if her ignorance (which is manifested here as lack of\ncertainty) is blameless. (Thus Guerrero, unlike other weakened\ninternalists, deny thesis i of the regress argument, since in his view\nignorant wrongdoing can be culpable in the absence of culpable\nignorance.) This is because there is an independently plausible moral\nprinciple that urges restraint in the face of uncertainty regarding\nthe potential harms that our actions might bring about (2007: 79).\nSimilarly, Nelkin and Rickless (2017a: 121\u20132) claim that being\naware of doing something that poses a risk of forgetting relevant\ninformation can anchor responsibility for unwitting wrongdoing, even\nin the absence of an akratic decision to assume the risk.\n\nIn turn, Robichaud (2014) claims that a belief in there being\nsufficient (albeit not decisive) reasons to perform an action\nsatisfies the requirement of awareness of moral significance, which\nentails that one can be blameworthy for performing an action one\nbelieves there are sufficient (albeit not decisive) reasons to avoid.\n(Relatedly, Sartorio [2017: 24\u20138] argues that one can be\nblameworthy if one is aware that one is acting from morally\nreproachable reasons, regardless of whether one is also aware that\none\u2019s action is overall morally wrong.) In so arguing, Robichaud\ndenies an important implicit assumption in the regress argument,\nnamely that an agent can rationally comply with an obligation (moral\nor epistemic), and thus can reasonably be expected to do so, only if\nshe believes that she ought to comply with it and therefore believes\nshe has decisive reasons in its favor (Levy 2009). On the contrary,\nRobichaud argues that for a course of action to be rationally open for\nan agent it isn\u2019t necessary that she believes she has decisive\nreasons in its favor; a belief concerning sufficient reasons is enough\n(Robichaud 2014: 142). See Levy 2016 for criticism.\n3.2 Ignorance and Epistemic Vices\n\nThe next position we\u2019ll consider goes a step further in\nrejecting the idea that responsibility requires awareness. According\nto this position, ignorant wrongdoers can be culpable for their\nignorance (and for actions performed out of it) even if the benighting\nacts that produced it were themselves performed out of ignorance of\ntheir wrongness. For this to be the case, it is claimed, is sufficient\nif in performing benighting acts agents exhibit epistemic\nvices that explain why they failed to improve their epistemic\nposition. On this view, then, the regress in the volitionists\u2019\nargument doesn\u2019t necessarily terminate in an episode of\nclear-eyed akrasia; it can also terminate in epistemically vicious\nconduct, regardless of whether the agent conceives it as such\n(Montmarquet 1995 & 1999; FitzPatrick 2008 & 2017). Notice\nthat this position is less conservative than weakened internalism,\nsince in the latter view culpability for ignorance requires awareness\nthat one has sufficient reasons to comply with certain epistemic\nobligations (Robichaud 2014: 145). By contrast, in the position\ncurrently under review no such awareness is required: an agent\u2019s\nepistemic vices might blind her to these reasons, and yet she can be\nblameworthy for ignorance resulting from her failure to comply with\nher epistemic obligations (Montmarquet 1999: 845; FitzPatrick 2008:\n606).\n\nPhilosophers who espouse this position thus deny thesis ii of the\nregress argument (according to which ignorance is culpable only if it\nderives from a benighting act performed in awareness of its wrongness)\nand, consequently, also deny thesis iii (that responsibility requires\noccurrent and de dicto beliefs about the action\u2019s\noverall wrongness), but only regarding benighting acts. So\nthey in effect posit an asymmetry in the epistemic requirements on\nblameworthiness: while blameworthiness for ordinary actions does\nrequire awareness of wrongdoing, blameworthiness for benighting acts\nand subsequent ignorance doesn\u2019t (FitzPatrick 2008: 609; see\nLevy 2009: 741 for criticism of this asymmetry). A further consequence\nis that they accept thesis i (that blameworthiness for actions\nperformed out of ignorance is always derivative) for all actions\nexcept for benighting acts (FitzPatrick 2008: 609 n.37; 2017: 32); and\naccept thesis iv as well (that both factual and moral ignorance can\nexculpate) (FitzPatrick 2008: 602; 2017: 35).\n\nFitzPatrick (2008) illustrates this position with the case of Mr.\nPotter, a powerful businessman who engages in ruthless business\npractices while thinking they are \u201cpermissibly\naggressive\u201d, therefore acting from ignorance of their wrongness.\nFitzPatrick (2008: 601, 609) agrees with volitionists that Mr. Potter\nis blameworthy for his ruthless business behavior only if (and\nbecause) he is blameworthy for the ignorance from which he acts; and\nalso agrees that if it turned out that he\u2019s blameless for the\nlatter, he\u2019d be blameless for the former as well (2008: 602).\nBut FitzPatrick sharply disagrees with volitionists on the conditions\nthat must be satisfied for ignorance to be culpable. In his view,\nignorance is culpable when it results from the violation of epistemic\nobligations regarding which the agent could reasonably have been\nexpected to comply given her cognitive capacities and the\nopportunities provided by her social context, and when such violation\nis due to the agent\u2019s epistemic vices such as\n\u201coverconfidence, arrogance, dismissiveness, laziness, dogmatism,\nincuriosity, self-indulgence, contempt, and so on\u201d (2008: 609).\nAccording to FitzPatrick, when this is the case the agent bears direct\nresponsibility for her ignorance even if her benighting\nacts\u2014i.e., the acts that evinced the epistemic vices just listed\n\u2014were themselves performed out of ignorance of their wrongness.\n(FitzPatrick\u2019s position, according to which culpability for\nunwitting wrongdoing is partially explained by the fact that the\nignorant agent should and could have known better has important\nsimilarities with the capacitarian view discussed in\n sect. 3.4\n below.)\n\nThis conception of culpable ignorance has been criticized on the\ngrounds that it isn\u2019t reasonable to expect epistemically vicious\nagents like Mr. Potter to do anything substantial to avoid or remedy\ntheir ignorance, at least not in the sense of \u2018reasonable\nexpectation\u2019 relevant for attributions of responsibility (Levy\n2009; Talbert 2013: 230\u20133). Levy argues that agents are\nblameworthy only \u201cif it is reasonable to expect them to conform\ntheir behavior to the appropriate normative standards\u201d and this,\nin turn, requires that \u201cconforming their behavior to normative\nstandards is something they can do rationally (and not merely by\nchance or accident)\u201d (2009: 735). However, Levy argues, the\nnotion of rationality relevant here is a \u201cthoroughly internalist\none\u201d, having to do with \u201cwhat I can decide to do as the\nresult of engaging in reasoning\u201d, that is, by deliberating on\nthe reasons I think I have for pursuing different courses of action\n(2009: 735). But in this internalist sense of \u2018rational\u2019,\nit isn\u2019t rational for Mr. Potter to do anything to correct his\nmoral outlook, given that by his lights the challenges to it that he\nencounters can rightly be dismissed as irrelevant. Levy concedes that\nin so thinking Mr. Potter exhibits epistemic vices, \u201cbut because\nhe does not conceive of them as vices, he has no internal\nreason\u201d for mending his ways and so it isn\u2019t reasonable to\nexpect him to do so (2009: 737). (See FitzPatrick 2017 for his\nresponse.)\n\nIn his arguments against the akrasia requirement on culpable\nignorance, Montmarquet goes further than FitzPatrick in that he denies\nthe thesis of doxastic involuntarism that plays an important role in\nthe regress argument. While FitzPatrick\u2019s objective is to\nestablish direct culpability for \u201cepistemically debilitating\nchoices\u201d (2008: 609, italics added),\nMontmarquet\u2019s main claim is that culpability for\nbeliefs themselves can be \u201cfundamental and\nunderived\u201d (1995: 43). This is because, in his view, agents\npossess \u201cdirect (albeit incomplete) control\u201d (1999: 844)\nover the formation of their beliefs. He agrees with volitionists\nthat\n\n\nif an agent is culpably ignorant of some fact, there will always have\nbeen some possible act or omission, but for which this ignorance would\nnot have existed, (1995: 42)\n\n\nbut he thinks that talk of benighting acts distracts us from the true\nsource of culpable ignorance, which is an \u201cintellectually\nirresponsible attitude\u201d and associated beliefs rather than\n\u201cthe acts and omissions to which that attitude and those beliefs\nled [the agent]\u201d (1995: 43).\n\nIn order to support his contention that agents can be directly\nculpable for holding certain beliefs, Montmarquet (1999: 844) argues,\nagainst Zimmerman 1997, that agents can in fact directly control their\nbeliefs by exercising direct control over the degree of care with\nwhich they form them. He offers the analogy of whistling carefully:\none can directly control the care one exerts in whistling, but this\ndoesn\u2019t imply that the whistling itself is only indirectly in\none\u2019s control; on the contrary, one directly controls both. If\nthe analogy holds, given that agents can directly control how careful\nthey are in forming their beliefs, they can also directly control\ntheir beliefs themselves and so it would follow that agents can be\ndirectly blameworthy for forming beliefs carelessly and for the\ncarelessly formed beliefs themselves. In response, Zimmerman (2002a;\n2008: 183\u20139) points out a disanalogy between the cases of\nwhistling carefully and forming beliefs carefully: while whistling is\nitself an action, believing something isn\u2019t an action but a\n(mental) state, which can be the result of the action of\ntaking care in forming beliefs. However, since we don\u2019t have\ndirect control over the results of our non-basic actions (taking care\nin forming beliefs being one of them), Zimmerman concludes that we\nlack direct control over our beliefs and so we can\u2019t be directly\nresponsible for them (2008: 188\u20139).\n3.3 Quality of Will\n\nWe turn now to examine a family of views that resist the regress\nargument by appealing to Strawson\u2019s (1962 [2003]) influential\nidea that praise-/blameworthiness tracks the agent\u2019s quality of\nwill. There are different ways of cashing out what exactly\n\u2018quality of will\u2019 means (Shoemaker 2013), but the basic\nidea is this: an agent is praiseworthy for an action or an attitude\nthat accords with the demands of morality if the performance of the\naction or the holding of the attitude arises from proper regard or\nconcern for another person\u2019s morally significant interests.\nConversely, an agent is blameworthy for an action or attitude that\nconflicts with the demands of morality if the performance of the\naction or the holding of the attitude arises from lack of proper\nregard or concern for those same interests. The key insight that\nquality-of-will theorists bring to bear on the debate over the EC is\nthat an agent need not believe that her action is right/wrong\n(or that she has reasons in favor or against doing it, or that she is\ndoing something morally risky) for the action to express the quality\nof her will and thus for her to be praise-/blameworthy in performing\nit. For example, when an ancient slaveholder beats her slave she\nclearly evinces lack of regard for the slave\u2019s interests, quite\nirrespectively of what her owns views about the permissibility of\nslavery are or whether she has ever paused to consider the issue\n(Rosen 2003: 72). Thus, if an agent\u2019s evinced quality of will is\nall that matters for blameworthiness (something that Rosen denies),\nthe slaveholder is manifestly blameworthy. On this view, then, de\ndicto awareness of the action\u2019s moral significance\nisn\u2019t required for blameworthiness (Fields 1994; Arpaly 2003\n& 2015; Harman 2011 & 2015; Talbert 2013 & 2017a;\nLittlejohn 2014; Mason 2015; Bj\u00f6rnsson 2017b; Weatherson 2019:\nch. 5), and the same goes for praiseworthiness (Arpaly 2003 &\n 2015).[8],\n [9]\n\nWhat kind of awareness is required according to quality-of-will\ntheorists? In their view, when assessing epistemic requirements on\nresponsibility\n\n\nwe should consider what a wrongdoer needs to know in order for her\nactions to express the attitudes and judgments that make blame\nappropriate. (Talbert 2013: 242)\n\n\nQuality-of-will theorists usually agree that for actions to express\nthe relevant attitudes and judgments factual awareness is\nrequired: the agent has to be aware of what she is doing and what the\nprobable consequences of her action are (Talbert 2017a: 47, 53; Harman\n2011: 465; 2015: 67; Arpaly 2015: 151). (Angela Smith 2005 & 2017\ndisagrees, arguing that failures of factual awareness, such as\nforgetting a friend\u2019s birthday, sometimes reveal inadequate\nmoral concern and thus are blameworthy. See also Bj\u00f6rnsson 2017b:\n152. Cf. Holly Smith 2011; Talbert 2017b.) As we just saw, they also\nagree that de dicto moral awareness isn\u2019t required.\nHowever, they disagree on whether de re moral\nawareness\u2014awareness of the action\u2019s right-/wrong-making\nfeatures regardless of whether one conceives them as such\u2014is\nrequired or not. Some think it is (Talbert 2013: 242; 2017a: 53;\nHarman 2011: 465; 2015: 67), while others think it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe clearest advocate of the latter position is Arpaly (2003 &\n2015). In her view, quality of will is essentially related to\nresponsiveness to moral reasons, understood as\n\n\n[wanting] noninstrumentally to take courses of action that have those\nfeatures that are (whether or not [one] describes them this way)\nright-making and not to take courses of action that have those\nfeatures that are (whether or not [one] describes them this way)\nwrong-making features. (Arpaly 2003: 79)\n\n\nThe key claim Arpaly defends is that responding in this sense to moral\nreasons doesn\u2019t require awareness of the features to which one\nis responding. Her central example is the much-discussed case of\nHuckleberry Finn, who helps Jim the runaway slave to escape despite\nbelieving that he is acting wrongly in \u201cstealing\u201d from\nJim\u2019s \u201cowner\u201d. Huck does the right thing and,\naccording to Arpaly, does it for the right reasons, namely in response\nto Jim\u2019s humanity (Arpaly 2003: 77). At the same time, however,\nHuck is unaware that he is helping Jim because he is a person\nlike himself (although he is aware that he is facilitating\nJim\u2019s flight). He \u201cis not capable of bringing to\nconsciousness his nonconscious awareness\u201d of Jim\u2019s\nhumanity (Arpaly 2003: 77), and thus fails to acquire de re\nawareness of the central right-making feature of his action. Since\nHuck seems to be praiseworthy despite lacking moral awareness (both\nde dicto and de re), Arpaly concludes that this kind\nof awareness isn\u2019t required for praiseworthiness, and something\nparallel holds for blameworthiness (Arpaly 2015: 151\u20132).\n\nNot everyone agrees with Arpaly\u2019s verdict on this case, however.\nSliwa (2017) challenges the intuition that Huck is morally\npraiseworthy, arguing that praise is ordinarily bestowed only on those\nagents who intentionally do the right thing. Given that Huck\ndoesn\u2019t know what the right thing to do in his situation is, he\ncan\u2019t do the right thing intentionally (although he\nintentionally performs an action that is in fact right), because\nintentional action incorporates, quite generally, a \u201cknow\nhow\u201d requirement (Sliwa 2017: 128\u201330). Since in the case\nof morally significant actions the required know-how incorporates both\nnon-moral and moral knowledge (2017: 131), this, on Sliwa\u2019s\nview, supports the thesis that praise-/blameworthiness does require\nmoral knowledge (and thus moral awareness). (Zimmerman 2008: 201\nargues that Huck is actually blameworthy, given that he acts\non the belief that his action is overall morally wrong.)\n\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize the extent of the disagreement\nbetween quality-of-will theorists and volitionists. The former\ninitially reject thesis iii of the regress argument, since they deny\nthat de dicto awareness of the action\u2019s moral\nsignificance is necessary for praise-/blameworthiness. But this\nrejection ultimately leads them to deny all four of the\nregress argument\u2019s main theses. Since quality-of-will theorists\nmaintain that moral knowledge isn\u2019t required for\npraise-/blameworthiness, they thus hold that moral ignorance (even if\nblameless) doesn\u2019t stand in the way of either praise or blame,\ntherefore denying thesis iv (the Parity Thesis) (Harman 2011: 465;\n2015: 65; Talbert 2013: 242; Arpaly 2015: 151; Weatherson 2019: ch.\n5). Also, since in their view what matters for blameworthiness is\nwhether the agent exhibits ill will in performing some action,\nblameworthiness for ignorant wrongdoing can be direct\u2014it\nneedn\u2019t derive from culpability for ignorance. This amounts to a\nrejection of thesis i when moral ignorance is at stake (Harman 2011\n& 2015; Talbert 2013; Arpaly 2015; Weatherson 2019: ch. 5).\nFinally, and in opposition to thesis ii, some quality-of-will\ntheorists claim that moral ignorance can be directly blameworthy,\ngiven that one\u2019s mistaken moral beliefs may reveal an inadequate\ndegree of moral concern (Harman 2011: 460; 2015: 68; see also Adams\n1985: 19. Cf. Arpaly 2003: 105\u20136). Thus, after rejecting all the\nbasic theses of the regress argument, quality-of-will theorists\nconclude that culpability for ignorant wrongdoing (and for ignorance\nitself) is much more prevalent than volitionists think.\n\nFor instance, on Talbert\u2019s (2013 & 2017a) account it will\noften be the case that morally ignorant wrongdoers are blameworthy,\nbecause\n\n\n[e]ven if a wrongdoer is ignorant of the fact that her behavior is\nwrong, and even if this ignorance is not her fault, her actions may\nstill express the contemptuous judgment that certain others do not\nmerit consideration, that their interests do not matter, and that\ntheir objections can be overlooked. (Talbert 2013: 234)\n\n\nTalbert concedes that if a wrongdoer\u2019s moral ignorance\nisn\u2019t her fault, it may well be the case that she\u2019s unable\nto rationally do the right thing. But far from showing that\nshe\u2019s thus blameless, what this shows according to Talbert is\nthat \u201chaving subjective rational access to avoiding an action is\nnot a requirement on being properly blamed for that action\u201d\n(Talbert 2013: 239; cf. Bj\u00f6rnsson 2017b: 149). This stands in\nsharp opposition to one of the volitionists\u2019 central\nconvictions\u2014a conviction that grounds their commitment to the\nimportance of de dicto moral awareness\u2014namely that\n\u201cIt is unfair to blame someone for doing something if he\nblamelessly believes that there is no compelling moral reason not to\ndo it\u201d (Rosen 2003: 74; see also Levy 2009: 738). Talbert\nresponds to the charge of unfairness by claiming that there is nothing\nunfair in blaming someone who knowingly (in the factual sense) and\ndeliberately has harmed us, even if we concede that it isn\u2019t\nreasonable to expect her to have avoided her moral ignorance and acted\nrightly (Talbert 2013: 238; 2017a: 53. See also Scanlon 2008:\n186\u20138; Arpaly 2003: 172\u20133; 2015: 155; Harman 2015: 66).\nHowever, by divorcing blameworthiness from reasonable expectations\nabout avoiding wrongdoing, Talbert\u2019s position, and that of other\nquality-of-will theorists, is vulnerable to the charge that it misses\nthe crucial connection between blameworthiness and desert, namely that\nblameworthy agents deserve certain negative reactions and\nadverse treatment partly because, and only if, it was reasonable to\nexpect them to do better (FitzPatrick 2017: 33; Levy 2011:\n194\u20135).\n\nIt becomes apparent at this point that the disagreement between\nquality-of-will theorists and the rest concerning the EC is ultimately\ngrounded on different conceptions of responsibility and\nblameworthiness (Wieland 2017a: 5; see the\n Conclusion\n below). On the one hand, philosophers of different persuasions\nregarding the EC\u2014volitionists, weakened internalists, epistemic\nvice theorists, and capacitarians\u2014appeal to elements associated\nwith responsibility as accountability, such as the relevance\nof the agent\u2019s capacities and opportunities to avoid wrongdoing\nand the concomitant reasonable expectations. (Of course, they disagree\nabout how to characterize these elements, and this disagreement partly\nexplains why they have different conceptions of the EC. See for\ninstance the exchanges between FitzPatrick 2008 & 2017 and Levy\n2009 & 2011: ch. 5; between Clarke 2017a and Levy 2017; and\nbetween Robichaud 2014 and Levy 2016.) On the other hand,\nquality-of-will theorists appeal to elements associated with\nresponsibility as attributability, such as the centrality of\nthe agent\u2019s \u201cmoral orientation\u201d (Talbert 2017a: 48)\nor \u201cdeep self\u201d (Wolf 1987) for blameworthiness and the\ncomparative irrelevance of historical factors about how the agent came\nto have the moral orientation or deep self she has (Arpaly 2003:\n172\u20133; Harman 2011: 462; Talbert 2017b: 19) or whether she could\nhave avoided wrongdoing (Scanlon 2008: 186\u20138; Talbert 2017a:\n48). For the distinction between different types of responsibility see\nWatson 1996, Shoemaker 2011, and Zimmerman 2015.\n3.4 Capacitarianism\n\nThe fourth type of response to the regress argument is the one that\ndeparts more radically from the idea that responsibility requires\nawareness. According to it, agents can be directly blameworthy not\nonly for actions and omissions performed out of moral ignorance, but\nalso for actions and omissions performed out of factual ignorance;\nthat is, for fully unwitting wrongful conduct. (Recall that\nquality-of-will theorists restrict their claims to morally ignorant\nwrongdoing. Again, exceptions are Angela Smith 2005 & 2017 and\nBj\u00f6rnsson 2017b.) Since what all the adherents to this position\nhave in common is the idea that blameworthiness in these cases is\nlargely (though not exclusively) explained by the presence of certain\ncapacities possession of which makes the agent capable of acquiring\nthe relevant awareness, their position can be dubbed\n\u2018capacitarianism\u2019. In their view, the best formulation of\nthe EC is disjunctive (Sher 2009: 87): agents satisfy the epistemic\nrequirements on responsibility either if they are aware of the\nrelevant factual and moral considerations or if they should and\ncould be aware of them given the available evidence, the\nopportunity to adequately process it, and their cognitive capacities.\nCapacitarians differ on what else (if anything) has to be added to the\nsecond disjunct, but they all agree that a central element in the\nexplanation of blameworthiness for ignorant wrongdoing is the fact\nthat the agent should and could have known better than she did\n(FitzPatrick 2008 & 2017; Sher 2009; Clarke 2014 & 2017a, b;\nMurray 2017; Rudy-Hiller 2017; Amaya & Doris 2015; Murray &\nVargas 2018 [Other Internet Resources]; Vargas 2018 [Other Internet\n Resources]).[10]\n\nAn important motivation for this view is to account for cases in which\npeople seem to be blameworthy for unwitting omissions despite the fact\nthat: i) the omissions and attendant failures of awareness\naren\u2019t explicable in terms of ill will; and ii) blameworthiness\ncan\u2019t be traced back to a previous failure to discharge some\nobligation (Sher 2017b). Staple cases of this sort are forgetting\ncases, such as this one (see also Clarke 2014: 164\u20135):\n\n\nHot Dog. Alessandra, a soccer mom, has gone to pick up her\nchildren at their elementary school. As usual, Alessandra is\naccompanied by the family\u2019s border collie, Bathsheba, who rides\nin the back of the van. Although it is very hot, the pick-up has never\ntaken long, so Alessandra leaves Sheba in the van while she goes to\ngather her children. This time, however, Alessandra is greeted by a\ntangled tale of misbehavior, ill-considered punishment, and\nadministrative bungling which requires several hours of indignant\nsorting out. During that time, Sheba languishes, forgotten, in the\nlocked car. When Alessandra and her children finally make it to the\nparking lot, they find Sheba unconscious from heat prostration. (Sher\n2009: 24)\n\n\nIn this example, Alessandra is intuitively blameworthy for omitting to\nlet the dog out of the van. But her wrongful omission is fully\nunwitting: she\u2019s unaware not only of its wrongness but even of\nthe fact that she\u2019s omitting to do something she ought to do in\nthe first place. Importantly, as the case is described there is no\nreason to think that Alessandra\u2019s omission stems from ill will\ntowards the dog or towards those who love the dog, such as her\nchildren (Sher 2009: 37, 91; see also Clarke 2017a: 246; King 2009:\n584\u20135; Amaya & Doris 2015: 266; Murray 2017: 516). Rather,\nwhat explains her failure of awareness isn\u2019t flawed character\ntraits or lack of regard for morally significant interests, but simply\nthe cognitive and emotional load placed upon her by the unusual\nsituation at the school (Sher 2009: 131), which, by assumption,\nwasn\u2019t overwhelming enough to excuse her for her omission (see\nAmaya & Doris 2015: 263). Finally, it\u2019s implausible to try\nto account for Alessandra\u2019s blameworthiness by positing a\nprevious failure to discharge some obligation of due care\u2014like\nsetting the alarm on her phone to remind her of the dog\u2014since\nthe situation was unpredictable (Sher 2009: 35\u20136) and intending\nto let the dog stay in the car for a couple of minutes doesn\u2019t\nseem to be wrong (cf. Nelkin & Rickless 2017a who claim that in\nthis sort of cases there usually is a previous violation of\nan obligation related to preventing the episode of forgetfulness). The\nomission in question is just a regrettable but, according to\ncapacitarians, culpable mistake (Amaya & Doris 2015; Murray 2017:\n516). So if intuitions about responsibility in this sort of cases\naren\u2019t misleading, neither awareness nor ill will are necessary\nfor blameworthiness. (Levy [2017] and Talbert [2017b] offer\nempirically-based error theories according to which intuitions in\nthese cases are misleading because people tend to\nmisattribute lack of moral concern to unwitting wrongdoers based\nsolely on the consequences of their actions, and this mistaken\nattribution is then used as grounds for blaming them. But Murray\net al. [2019] provide contrary empirical evidence suggesting\nthat what drives ordinary people to assign responsibility in\nforgetting cases is mainly the presence of an adequate opportunity to\nremember rather than the level of concern the forgetful agent\ndisplayed toward what she was supposed to do.)\n\nThe challenge for capacitarians is then to explain three things: i)\nwhat norms support the claim that unwitting wrongdoers\nshould have known better; ii) what capacities\njustify the assumption that unwitting wrongdoers could have\nknown better; and iii) why its being true that an unwitting wrongdoer\nshould and could have known better grounds responsibility for\nunwitting\n wrongdoing.[11]\n\nBefore going into the details of how capacitarians answer these\nquestions, let\u2019s see what theses of the regress argument are\ndenied by them. All capacitarians (with the exception of FitzPatrick,\nsee fn. 10) reject theses i and iii, since they are united in the\nbeliefs that blameworthiness for unwitting conduct can be direct and\nneedn\u2019t trace back to culpable ignorance (against thesis i), and\nalso that factual awareness\u2014and a fortiori occurrent\nand de dicto moral awareness\u2014isn\u2019t necessary for\ndirect responsibility (against thesis iii). Since capacitarians\nusually focus on factual rather than on moral ignorance, they usually\nleave thesis iv (Parity) untouched (but see Sher 2017a). However, they\nseem to be committed to accepting it, given that a crucial aspect of\nthe capacitarian view is that agents are excused for their unwitting\nwrongdoing whenever isn\u2019t reasonable to expect them to know\nbetter due to an unfavorable epistemic situation (Sher 2017a; Clarke\n2017a: 242; Murray 2017: 515, 521; Rudy-Hiller 2017: 408). But since\nsometimes a situation is epistemically unfavorable for forming correct\nmoral beliefs (FitzPatrick 2017: 34\u20136), it follows from\nthe capacitarian view that at least in some such circumstances agents\nare excused for not knowing better in moral matters (FitzPatrick 2008:\n602). Finally, there is disagreement among capacitarians whether\nthesis ii (that blameworthiness for ignorance is necessarily\nderivative) is true or not. Clarke (2014: 171, 173; 2017a:\n245\u20136) tentatively accepts it, since he thinks that failures of\nawareness aren\u2019t culpable if they don\u2019t result from a\nculpable benighting action or omission. At the same time, he denies\nthat culpability for ignorant wrongdoing necessitates culpability for\nthe underlying ignorance (Clarke 2017a: 246), thus avoiding the\nregress in the volitionists\u2019 argument. In Clarke\u2019s view,\nthen, an agent can be blameworthy for an unwitting wrongful action\neven if the ignorance from which she acts isn\u2019t culpable, as\nlong as such ignorance is substandard\u2014and therefore faulty\n(Clarke 2017a: 245). (Note that the soundness of this move rests on\nthe defensibility of the distinction between culpable and faulty\nignorance. See Rudy-Hiller [2017: 416] for criticism.) By contrast,\nRudy-Hiller (2017: 413) rejects thesis ii, since he claims that an\nagent is directly blameworthy for her ignorance if she is capable of\ngaining the required awareness and there is no significant impediment\nto the exercise of the relevant cognitive capacities.\n\nLet\u2019s return now to the three central questions capacitarians\nmust answer to give plausibility to their view. The first concerns the\nnature of the norms of awareness supporting the claim that certain\nunwitting wrongdoers should have known better. The central function of\nthese norms is to set a standard against which failures of awareness\nare evaluated to determine which ones are defective and which\ndon\u2019t. When failures of awareness aren\u2019t defective, it\nisn\u2019t the case that the involved agents should have known better\nand thus they are excused for their unwitting wrongdoing.\nCapacitarians agree that norms of awareness are sensitive to the\nagent\u2019s cognitive capacities and circumstances (Sher 2009: 110;\nClarke 2014: 167; Murray 2017: 516; Rudy-Hiller 2017: 413; FitzPatrick\n2017: 37). They also agree that these norms are derivative, in the\nsense that both their content (the considerations agents should be\naware of) and their normative force (their bindingness on agents) come\nfrom another set of norms, namely moral ones. In other words,\nit\u2019s because awareness of certain considerations is necessary\nfor fulfilling moral obligations that such awareness can be demanded\nof agents (Sher 2009: 111\u20132; Murray 2017: 515).\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to note that the norms of awareness capacitarians\nrely on to substantiate should-have-known allegations aren\u2019t\nduties of inquiry. While norms of awareness directly demand awareness\nof relevant considerations, duties of inquiry impose obligations to\nundertake information-gathering actions that contribute to the\noccurrence of such awareness (Rosen 2004: 302; 2008: 600\u20131; H.\nSmith 2014; Wieland 2017a: 6\u20138). In other words, while norms of\nawareness are concerned with agents\u2019 states of mind,\nduties of inquiry are concerned with agents\u2019\n activities.[12]\n This naturally generates the following worry concerning norms of\nawareness: given that \u201cbecoming aware is not something we do but\nsomething that happens to us\u201d (Sher 2009: 112; see also Rosen\n2004: 302; 2008: 600), one might wonder whether the should-have-known\ncriterion can be used to undergird blameworthiness after all. If\nfailures of awareness escape the agent\u2019s direct control, how\ncould it be true that such involuntary failures partly explain direct\nresponsibility for unwitting wrongdoing? (Nelkin 2011: 679\u201380;\nNelkin & Rickless 2015).\n\nCapacitarians have different responses to this worry. Sher (2009:\n147\u20138) ultimately rejects the control condition on moral\nresponsibility in favor of an origination requirement (see below).\nClarke, who holds on to the control condition, denies that norms of\nawareness give rise to moral obligations; in his view, they merely set\na standard for evaluating failures of awareness as faulty or not\n(2014: 167). Rudy-Hiller (2017: 418) advances a notion of control\naccording to which agents do have responsibility-relevant control over\ntheir states of awareness and so they can be morally obligated to\nremember or notice morally significant considerations. Finally, Murray\n(2017) describes, and offers empirical evidence for, a distinctive\n\u2018vigilance\u2019 capacity that enables agents to become aware\nof relevant considerations and which, according to him, affords them\ndirect control over the degree of awareness they display.\n\nThe second central question for capacitarians is which capacities make\nit true that an unwitting wrongdoer could have known better. Clarke\noffers the following characterization of them:\n\n\nSome are capacities to do things that are in a plain sense active: to\nturn one\u2019s attention to, or maintain attention on, some matter;\nto raise a question in one\u2019s mind or pursue some line of\ninquiry; to make a decision about whether to do this or that. Others,\nthough capacities to do things, aren\u2019t capacities whose exercise\nconsists in intentional action. These include capacities to remember,\nto think of relevant considerations, to notice features of one\u2019s\nsituation and appreciate their normative significance, to think at\nappropriate times to do things that need doing. (2017a: 242)\n\n\nCapacitarians then appeal to the idea of unexercised capacities to\nexplain why certain unwitting wrongdoers could have been aware of\nrelevant considerations: it\u2019s because those wrongdoers possess\nthe requisite cognitive capacities, but failed to exercise them\ndespite the absence of significant impediments, that they could have\nknown better (Clarke 2017a: 242; 2017b: 67; Murray 2017: 520;\nRudy-Hiller 2017: 407; Vargas 2018: 15 [Other Internet\nResources]).\n\nSeveral objections can be raised at this point. First, notice that\neven cognitive capacities that issue in intentional actions (such as\nraising a question in one\u2019s mind) don\u2019t provide direct\ncontrol over awareness of relevant considerations but only\nfavor its occurrence, which remains out of one\u2019s\ncontrol (Rosen 2004: 302; Montmarquet 1999: 845). So, under the\nassumption that control is required for responsibility, it remains\nunclear how failures of awareness contribute to explaining direct\nblameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing (Nelkin & Rickless 2015.\nFor a similar objection stated in terms of choice rather than control,\nsee Moore & Hurd 2011: 164). Second, and relatedly, the claim that\npossession of these capacities ground reasonable expectations of the\nsort that are relevant for attributions of responsibility (Clarke\n2017a: 242; 2017b: 67) can be disputed, for since the exercise of some\nof these capacities isn\u2019t under our control, whether they are\ndisplayed or not is a chance occurrence and chance occurrences\ncan\u2019t ground reasonable expectations (Levy 2017: 255. Clarke\n2017a: 249\u201350 offers a brief response to this objection).\n\nThird and finally, it has been doubted whether capacitarians have a\nconvincing story about what it takes to have the relevant unexercised\ncognitive capacities (Levy 2014: 124\u20135; Moore & Hurd 2011:\n160\u20131). Sher, for instance, relies on a counterfactual account\nof capacities, according to which saying that someone was capable of\nnoticing, remembering, thinking of something, etc., \u201cis only to\nsay that he would have remembered [noticed, thought of] in an\nappropriate range of alternative situations\u201d (2009:\n114, italics added). The crucial task is of course to define what the\nappropriate range is, since, intuitively, one doesn\u2019t have a\ncapacity to X if one would only very rarely successfully X in a range\nof relevant scenarios. For instance, it might be argued that\nAlessandra can\u2019t be credited with the possession of the relevant\ncognitive capacity if we assume, plausibly, that she would only very\nrarely remember the dog in a range of similar situations to the one\nshe actually confronted. If one were to respond that it suffices for\nattributing the relevant unexercised capacity that there is a\ncounterfactual scenario in which Alessandra does remember the dog,\nthis would objectionably lower the bar for attributing unexercised\ncapacities, with the consequence that many intuitively blameless\nunwitting wrongdoers would turn out to be blameworthy after all (Levy\n2014: 125). (See Vargas 2013 [ch. 7] and Vargas 2018 [Other Internet\nResources] for a version of the counterfactual account that attempts\nto give more precision to the \u2018appropriate range\u2019\ncriterion for attributing unexercised capacities.)\n\nAlternatively, some capacitarians attribute unexercised capacities by\nappealing not to counterfactual scenarios but to the agent\u2019s\npast performances in similar situations (Clarke 2014: 166; 2017a: 244;\nRudy-Hiller 2017: 407\u20138). This move raises problems of its own,\nhowever, since, on the one hand, an agent might possess a relevant\ncognitive capacity\u2014for instance a quite good capacity to\nremember certain considerations\u2014despite the fact that she often\nfails to exercise it perhaps because she doesn\u2019t care much about\nthose considerations (Nelkin & Rickless 2015; see also Nelkin\n& Rickless 2017a: 112\u20133). On the other hand, an\nagent\u2019s past performances aren\u2019t necessarily a good proxy\nfor attributing her a certain unexercised capacity now, since\ndespite her previous successes she might have lost the relevant\ncapacity in the meantime and so it would be unfair to fault her for\nher current lack of awareness (Sher 2009: 109).\n\nThe third central question for capacitarians is why the truth of the\nshould-and-could-have-known-better clause contributes to explaining\nblameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing and what, if anything, has to\nbe added to the explanation. Sher states the worry in this way:\n\n\nthe reason the agent\u2019s actual awareness seems significant is\nthat it implies that the act\u2019s being wrong or foolish is among\nthe total set of considerations in light of which he chose to perform\nit. To whatever extent his choice was in this way knowing as well as\nwilling, the act, qua instance of wrong or foolish behavior, is in a\nsuitably deep sense his own. However, and in stark contrast, when an\nagent merely should be aware that he is acting wrongly or foolishly,\nthere is no comparably direct connection between the wrongness or\nfoolishness of what he does and his informed will. Hence, where no\nactual awareness is involved, the standard rationale for holding him\nresponsible does not appear to be available. (Sher 2009: 74)\n\n\nAnother way of putting the worry is this: since attributions of\nresponsibility are usually anchored in some morally relevant feature\nof the agent to which awareness contributes, such as choice or\ngood/ill will (Amaya & Doris 2015: 254), an account of\nresponsibility for unwitting wrongdoing in which neither choice nor\nthe agent\u2019s quality of will are implicated runs the risk of\nappearing ad hoc (King 2009: 587). So the challenge for\ncapacitarians is to show that their account isn\u2019t ad\nhoc and, at the same time, to provide a \u201cmorally plausible\ndesert basis for blame\u201d in cases of unwitting wrongdoing (Moore\n& Hurd 2011: 160).\n\nWe\u2019ll focus on Sher\u2019s response to this challenge.\nConcerning the charge of ad hocness, Sher argues that, quite\ngenerally, the crucial morally relevant feature implicated in\nattributions of responsibility isn\u2019t choice, control, or quality\nof will but origination, understood as an appropriate causal\nrelation between the agent and her action\u2019s right-/wrong-making\nfeatures (Sher 2009: 147; 2017b: 9\u201310). So, in Sher\u2019s\nview, in order to appropriately praise or blame an agent for an action\nit must be the case that its relevant moral features are suitably\nconnected to her (Sher 2009: 82). One way in which this suitable\nconnection occurs is when the agent is aware of those features and\nchooses to perform the action in light of them, thus making the action\n\u201cin a suitably deep sense his own\u201d (2009: 74). Another way\n(in the case of wrong\n acts)[13]\n in which the suitable connection occurs is when the agent\u2019s\nunawareness of the action\u2019s wrong-making features is defective\nin the sense indicated above and such unawareness is caused\nby the agent\u2019s constitutive attitudes, dispositions, and traits.\nWhen this is the case, Sher claims, the action\u2019s wrongness is\nsuitably connected to the agent and so\u2014assuming that she\nsatisfies other non-epistemic conditions as well\u2014she can\njustifiably be held responsible for her unwitting wrongdoing (2009:\n86\u20138, 118). For instance, if we assume that Alessandra could\nhave recalled the dog, and also that her failure to do so was caused\nby constitutive features of her psychology such as her solicitousness\nto her children and her anxiety about conflict (2009: 92), she\nsatisfies Sher\u2019s EC and so she\u2019s blameworthy for her\nunwitting omission (assuming, again, that she satisfies other\nnon-epistemic conditions as well). Thus, by appealing to a single\nnotion\u2014origination\u2014that allegedly grounds responsibility\nboth in cases of witting and unwitting wrongdoing, Sher meets the\ncharge of ad hocness.\n\nThis isn\u2019t enough, however, for it still must be shown that this\npurely causal origination relation is a morally plausibly desert basis\nfor blame. Sher (2009) claims that it is, because the psychological\nfeatures he classifies as constitutive of the agent\u2014her cares,\nvalues, beliefs and emotional makeup, but also her patterns of mental\nassociation, \u201cthe speed and accuracy of [her] inferences and\ndecision-making\u201d (2009: 86) and even \u201cthe relevant\nneurophysiological mechanisms\u201d (2009: 122) that produce her\nthoughts and actions\u2014\u201csustain her normal patterns of\nintellectual functioning\u201d (2009: 122) and make her a responsible\nagent (2009: 121), and so in reacting to her failures of awareness\n(and subsequent wrongdoing) caused by those psychological features we\nare reacting to the whole person as the source of those failures\n(2009: 92). Sher (2009: 91; 2017b: 10) emphasizes that the\npsychological features that cause failures of awareness and explain\nthe agent\u2019s blameworthiness needn\u2019t be moral flaws\nthemselves. For instance, Alessandra\u2019s solicitousness to her\nchildren isn\u2019t a moral flaw; it may even be a good\ntrait, and yet it remains true that if it caused Alessandra\u2019s\nunawareness it partially explains her blameworthiness for her\nomission. In sum, Sher\u2019s view is that the origination relation\nexplains why blaming unwitting wrongdoers is appropriate because it\nensures that the whole person was implicated in the wrongdoing for\nwhich she is blamed.\n\nHowever, many authors have found this aspect of Sher\u2019s position\nproblematic. Levy claims that while it\u2019s very plausible that\norigination is a condition on moral responsibility, it\nisn\u2019t plausible to think \u201cthat responsibility\nconsists in origination\u201d (2014: 127). The fact that an\nagent\u2019s failure of awareness causally originates in her\npsychology doesn\u2019t seem to warrant blaming her for the action or\nomission\u2019s wrongness, since the latter isn\u2019t\nlinked to her in a way the shows anything about the quality of her\nwill (Levy 2014: 128; see also Talbert 2017a: 57; Bj\u00f6rnsson\n2017b: 143). Similarly, while agreeing with Sher that agents can\nsometimes be held directly responsible for their failures of awareness\nand subsequent wrongdoing, Angela Smith (2010) argues that this is so\nonly when those failures exhibit a rational connection to the\nagent\u2019s evaluative judgments. By contrast, a purely\ncausal connection of the sort Sher defends \u201ccannot\nestablish the right kind of connection between an agent and\nher wrongdoing\u201d to justify blaming her for it (A. Smith 2010:\n523). Finally, Moore and Hurd (2011: 184) object that while the moral\nrelevance of conscious choice for blameworthiness is intuitively\nclear, it isn\u2019t at all clear how the fact that the agent\u2019s\n\u201cpsychophysical apparatus that characteristically causes her\nchosen actions also caused her on this occasion to do this unchosen\naction\u201d could analogously make blame appropriate. They thus\ndispute Sher\u2019s (2009: 140) contention that conscious choice and\nfailures of awareness (caused in the way he indicates) are equally\ngood ways of satisfying the origination relation and grounding\n blameworthiness.[14],\n [15]\n4. Conclusion\n\nWe have surveyed the five main positions regarding the EC on moral\nresponsibility. Intuitively, being morally responsible for some action\nor event requires awareness of certain things. As we have seen,\nhowever, there is great controversy about how to characterize the kind\nand content of the requisite awareness and, more fundamentally, about\nwhether awareness is actually required at all or not. A natural\nquestion is: how can we adjudicate the dispute among the different\npositions? The structure of the discussion suggests focusing on two\ncriteria (Wieland 2017a: 26): i) what position fits best with our\nintuitions about responsibility in different cases; ii) what position\nmerges best with the right conception of responsibility.\n\nConcerning the first criterion, many philosophers take it as a given\nthat theorizing about moral responsibility must be constrained by our\nordinary judgments and intuitions. So if an account of the EC clashes\nwith those judgments and intuitions, that gives us a pro\ntanto reason to reject it and, conversely, being able to\naccommodate them is a point in its favor (Sher 2009: 17; Clarke 2014:\n162; Schnall 2004: 308; FitzPatrick 2008: 610; Peels 2011: 578;\nMontmarquet 1999: 845; Arpaly 2015: 155). Other philosophers reject\nthis \u201cmethodological conservatism\u201d (Levy 2017) and take\nthe opposite line of giving priority to what they take to be the\ncorrect theory of responsibility, even if it implies that a good many\nof our ordinary judgments and intuitions are misguided (Rosen 2004:\n296; Zimmerman 2008: 205). In order to break the stalemate in the\ntheory vs. intuitions dispute, some have advanced an error theory of\nintuitions of blameworthiness in cases of unwitting wrongdoing which,\nif correct, would entail that failing to accommodate them\nshouldn\u2019t be hold against an account of the EC (Levy 2017;\nTalbert 2017b); while others have offered empirical evidence to\nsupport the very same intuitions (Murray et al. 2019). Yet\nother philosophers have presented empirical evidence concerning\nordinary intuitions of praise-/blameworthiness in cases of moral\nignorance that appears to support the quality-of-will theorists\u2019\nview that moral knowledge isn\u2019t required for either (Faraci\n& Shoemaker 2014). Thus, one way of settling the debate on the EC\nis to pursue this discussion on the preeminence, reliability, and\ncontent of ordinary intuitions about responsibility.\n\nConcerning the second criterion, it was noted at the end of\n section 3.3\n that the disagreement between quality-of-will theorists and the rest\nis partially grounded on competing conceptions of responsibility, and\nthis suggests that settling the debate on the EC partly depends on how\nthis broader dispute is resolved. Some philosophers think that it can\nbe shown that one conception is the only correct one (Levy 2005; A.\nSmith 2012), but the consensus seems to be that the different\nconceptions are all valid, since each of them captures different\naspects of our responsibility practices (Watson 1996; Shoemaker 2011;\nZimmerman 2015). If the latter view is correct, it\u2019s entirely\npossible that certain epistemic requirements apply to some types of\nresponsibility but not to others (Mason 2015; Zimmerman 2017) and,\nconsequently, it might well be the case that there are different EC\ndepending on the type of responsibility we focus on.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, Robert Merrihew, 1985, \u201cInvoluntary Sins\u201d,\n<em>Philosophical Review</em>, 94(1): 3\u201331.\ndoi:10.2307/2184713", "Alexander, Lawrence and Kimberly Kessler Ferzan, 2009, <em>Crime\nand Culpability: A Theory of Criminal Law</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511804595", "Alston, William P., 1988, \u201cThe Deontological Conception of\nEpistemic Justification\u201d, <em>Philosophical Perspectives</em>,\n2: 257\u2013299.
