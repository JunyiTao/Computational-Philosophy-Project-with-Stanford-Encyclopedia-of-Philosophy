    "main_text": "An Anatomy of the Debates || Units of Evolutionary Transition\n4. Conclusion\n\nIt makes no sense to treat different answers as competitors if they\nare answering different questions. We have reviewed a framework of\nfour questions with which the debates appearing under the rubric of\n\u201cunits of selection\u201d can be classified and clarified. The\noriginal discussants of the units of selection problem separated the\nclassic question about the level of selection or interaction (the\ninteractor question) from the issue of how large a chunk of the genome\nfunctions as a replicating unit (the replicator question). The\ninteractor question should also be separated from the question of\nwhich entity should be seen as acquiring adaptations as a result of\nthe selection process (the manifestor-of-adaptation question). In\naddition, there is a crucial ambiguity in the meaning of adaptation\nthat is routinely ignored in these debates: adaptation as a selection\nproduct and adaptation as an engineering design. Finally, we can\ndistinguish the issue of the entity that ultimately benefits from the\nselection process (the beneficiary question) from the other three\nquestions.\n\nThis set of distinctions has been used to analyze leading points of\nview about the units of selection and to clarify precisely the\nquestion or combination of questions with which each of the\nprotagonists is concerned. There are many points in the debates in\nwhich misunderstandings may be avoided by a precise characterization\nof which of the units of selection questions is being addressed.\n",
