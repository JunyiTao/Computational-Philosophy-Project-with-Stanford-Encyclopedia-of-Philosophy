In considering Marx\u2019s attitude to\ncommunism and justice there are really only two viable possibilities:\neither he thought that communism would be a just society or he thought\nthat the concept of justice would not apply: that communism would\ntranscend justice.\n\nCommunism is described by Marx, in the Critique of the Gotha\nProgramme, as a society in which each person should contribute\naccording to their ability and receive according to their need. This\ncertainly sounds like a theory of justice, and could be adopted as\nsuch (Gilabert 2015). However, many will hold that it is truer to\nMarx\u2019s thought to say that this is part of an account in which\ncommunism transcends justice, as Lukes has argued (Lukes 1987).\n\nIf we start with the idea that the point of ideas of justice is to\nresolve disputes, then a society without disputes would have no need\nor place for justice. We can see this by reflecting upon the idea of\nthe circumstances of justice in the work of David Hume\n(1711\u20131776). Hume argued that if there was enormous material\nabundance\u2014if everyone could have whatever they wanted without\ninvading another\u2019s share\u2014we would never have devised rules\nof justice. And, of course, there are suggestions in Marx\u2019s\nwritings that communism would be a society of such abundance. But Hume\nalso suggested that justice would not be needed in other\ncircumstances; if there were complete fellow-feeling between all human\nbeings, there would be no conflict and no need for justice. Of course,\none can argue whether either material abundance or human\nfellow-feeling to this degree would be possible, but the point is that\nboth arguments give a clear sense in which communism transcends\njustice.\n\nNevertheless, we remain with the question of whether Marx thought that\ncommunism could be commended on other moral grounds. On a broad\nunderstanding, in which morality, or perhaps better to say ethics, is\nconcerned with the idea of living well, it seems that communism can be\nassessed favourably in this light. One compelling argument is that\nMarx\u2019s career simply makes no sense unless we can attribute such\na belief to him. But beyond this we can be brief in that the\nconsiderations adduced in\n Section 2\n above apply again. Communism clearly advances human flourishing, in\nMarx\u2019s view. The only reason for denying that, in Marx\u2019s\nvision, it would amount to a good society is a theoretical antipathy\nto the word \u201cgood\u201d. And here the main point is that, in\nMarx\u2019s view, communism would not be brought about by high-minded\nbenefactors of humanity. Quite possibly his determination to retain\nthis point of difference between himself and other socialists led him\nto disparage the importance of morality to a degree that goes beyond\nthe call of theoretical necessity.\n",
