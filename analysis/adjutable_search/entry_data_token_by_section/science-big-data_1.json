Extrapolating Data Patterns: The Role of Statistics and Software\n\nBig data are often associated to the idea of data-driven\nresearch, where learning happens through the accumulation of data and\nthe application of methods to extract meaningful patterns from those\ndata. Within data-driven inquiry, researchers are expected to use data\nas their starting point for inductive inference, without relying on\ntheoretical preconceptions\u2014a situation described by advocates as\n\u201cthe end of theory\u201d, in contrast to theory-driven\napproaches where research consists of testing a hypothesis (Anderson\n2008, Hey et al. 2009). In principle at least, big data constitute the\nlargest pool of data ever assembled and thus a strong starting point\nto search for correlations (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger & Cukier 2013).\nCrucial to the credibility of the data-driven approach is the efficacy\nof the methods used to extrapolate patterns from data and evaluate\nwhether or not such patterns are meaningful, and what\n\u201cmeaning\u201d may involve in the first place. Hence, some\nphilosophers and data scholars have argued that \n\n\nthe most important and distinctive characteristic of Big Data [is] its\nuse of statistical methods and computational means of analysis,\n(Symons & Alvarado 2016: 4) \n\n\nsuch as for instance machine learning tools, deep neural networks and\nother \u201cintelligent\u201d practices of data handling. \n\nThe emphasis on statistics as key adjudicator of validity and\nreliability of patterns extracted from data is not novel. Exponents of\nlogical empiricism looked for logically watertight methods to secure\nand justify inference from data, and their efforts to develop a theory\nof probability proceeded in parallel with the entrenchment of\nstatistical reasoning in the sciences in the first half of the\ntwentieth century (Romeijn 2017). In the early 1960s, Patrick Suppes\noffered a seminal link between statistical methods and the philosophy\nof science through his work on the production and interpretation of\ndata models. As a philosopher deeply embedded in experimental\npractice, Suppes was interested in the means and motivations of key\nstatistical procedures for data analysis such as data reduction and\ncurve fitting. He argued that once data are adequately\nprepared for statistical modelling, all the concerns and\nchoices that motivated data processing become irrelevant to their\nanalysis and interpretation. This inspired him to differentiate\nbetween models of theory, models of experiment and models of data,\nnoting that such different components of inquiry are governed by\ndifferent logics and cannot be compared in a straightforward way. For\ninstance, \n\n\nthe precise definition of models of the data for any given experiment\nrequires that there be a theory of the data in the sense of the\nexperimental procedure, as well as in the ordinary sense of the\nempirical theory of the phenomena being studied. (Suppes 1962: 253)\n\n\n\nSuppes viewed data models as necessarily statistical: that is, as\nobjects \n\n\ndesigned to incorporate all the information about the experiment which\ncan be used in statistical tests of the adequacy of the theory.\n(Suppes 1962: 258) \n\n\nHis formal definition of data models reflects this decision, with\nstatistical requirements such as homogeneity, stationarity and order\nidentified as the ultimate criteria to identify a data model Z and\nevaluate its adequacy: \n\n\nZ is an N-fold model of the data for experiment Y if and\nonly if there is a set Y and a probability measure P on\nsubsets of Y such that \\(Y = \\langle Y, P\\rangle\\) is a model\nof the theory of the experiment, Z is an N-tuple of elements of\nY, and Z satisfies the statistical tests of homogeneity,\nstationarity and order. (1962: 259) \n\n\nThis analysis of data models portrayed statistical methods as key\nconduits between data and theory, and hence as crucial components of\ninferential reasoning.\n\nThe focus on statistics as entry point to discussions of inference\nfrom data was widely promoted in subsequent philosophical work.\nProminent examples include Deborah Mayo, who in her book Error and\nthe Growth of Experimental Knowledge asked: \n\n\nWhat should be included in data models? The overriding constraint is\nthe need for data models that permit the statistical assessment of fit\n(between prediction and actual data); (Mayo 1996: 136) \n\n\nand Bas van Fraassen, who also embraced the idea of data models as\n\u201csummarizing relative frequencies found in data\u201d (Van\nFraassen 2008: 167). Closely related is the emphasis on statistics as\nmeans to detect error within datasets in relation to specific\nhypotheses, most prominently endorsed by the error-statistical\napproach to inference championed by Mayo and Aris Spanos (Mayo &\nSpanos 2009a). This\napproach aligns with the emphasis on computational methods for data\nanalysis within big data research, and supports the idea that the\nbetter the inferential tools and methods, the better the chance to\nextract reliable knowledge from data.\n\nWhen it comes to addressing methodological challenges arising from the\ncomputational analysis of big data, however, statistical expertise\nneeds to be complemented by computational savvy in the training and\napplication of algorithms associated to artificial intelligence,\nincluding machine learning but also other mathematical procedures for\noperating upon data (Bringsjord & Govindarajulu 2018). Consider\nfor instance the problem of overfitting, i.e., the mistaken\nidentification of patterns in a dataset, which can be greatly\namplified by the training techniques employed by machine learning\nalgorithms. There is no guarantee that an algorithm trained to\nsuccessfully extrapolate patterns from a given dataset will be as\nsuccessful when applied to other data. Common approaches to this\nproblem involve the re-ordering and partitioning of both data and\ntraining methods, so that it is possible to compare the application of\nthe same algorithms to different subsets of the data\n(\u201ccross-validation\u201d), combine predictions arising from\ndifferently trained algorithms (\u201censembling\u201d) or use\nhyperparameters (parameters whose value is set prior to data training)\nto prepare the data for analysis.\n\nHandling these issues, in turn, requires \n\n\nfamiliarity with the mathematical operations in question, their\nimplementations in code, and the hardware architectures underlying\nsuch implementations. (Lowrie 2017: 3) \n\n\nFor instance, machine learning \n\n\naims to build programs that develop their own analytic or descriptive\napproaches to a body of data, rather than employing ready-made\nsolutions such as rule-based deduction or the regressions of more\ntraditional statistics. (Lowrie 2017: 4) \n\n\nIn other words, statistics and mathematics need to be complemented by\nexpertise in programming and computer engineering. The ensemble of\nskills thus construed results in a specific epistemological approach\nto research, which is broadly characterised by an emphasis on the\nmeans of inquiry as the most significant driver of research goals and\noutputs. This approach, which Sabina Leonelli characterised as\ndata-centric, involves \u201cfocusing more on the processes\nthrough which research is carried out than on its ultimate\noutcomes\u201d (Leonelli 2016: 170). In this view, procedures,\ntechniques, methods, software and hardware are the prime motors of\ninquiry and the chief influence on its outcomes. Focusing more\nspecifically on computational systems, John Symons and Jack Horner\nargued that much of big data research consists of\nsoftware-intensive science rather than data-driven research:\nthat is, science that depends on software for its design, development,\ndeployment and use, and thus encompasses procedures, types of\nreasoning and errors that are unique to software, such as for example\nthe problems generated by attempts to map real-world quantities to\ndiscrete-state machines, or approximating numerical operations (Symons\n& Horner 2014: 473). Software-intensive science is arguably\nsupported by an algorithmic rationality focused on the\nfeasibility, practicality and efficiency of algorithms, which is\ntypically assessed by reference to concrete situations of inquiry\n(Lowrie 2017). \n",
