    "main_text": "The early Peripatetics: Theophrastus and Eudemus || Wholly Hypothetical Syllogisms\n3.4 Wholly Hypothetical Syllogisms\n\n\nTheophrastus is further credited with the invention of a system of the\nlater so-called \u2018wholly hypothetical syllogisms\u2019\n(Theophrastus fr. 113 Fortenbaugh). These syllogisms were originally\nabbreviated term-logical arguments of the kind\n\n If [something is] A, [it is] B.\n If [something is] B, [it is] C.\n Therefore, if [something is] A, [it is] C.\n \n\n\nand at least some of them were regarded as reducible to Aristotle\u2019s\ncategorical syllogisms, presumably by way of the equivalences to\n\u2018Every A is B\u2019, etc. In parallel to\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistic, Theophrastus distinguished three figures;\neach had sixteen modes. The first eight modes of the first figure are\nobtained by going through all permutations with \u2018not\nX\u2019 instead of \u2018X\u2019 (with X\nfor A, B, C); the second eight modes are\nobtained by using a rule of contraposition on the conclusion:\n\n(CR)\nFrom \u2018if X, Y\u2019 infer\n\u2018if the contradictory of Y then the contradictory of\nX\u2019\n\n\n\nThe sixteen modes of the second figure were obtained by using (CR) on\nthe schema of the first premise of the first figure arguments,\ne.g.\n\n\nIf [something is] not B, [it is] not A.\n If [something is] B, [it is] C.\n Therefore, if [something is] A, [it is] C.\n\n\n\n\nThe sixteen modes of the third figure were obtained by using (CR) on\nthe schema of the second premise of the first figure arguments,\ne.g.\n\n\nIf [something is] A, [it is] B.\n If [something is] not C, [it is] not B.\n Therefore, if [something is] A, [it is] C.\n\n\n\n\nTheophrastus claimed that all second and third figure syllogisms could\nbe reduced to first figure syllogisms. If Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(2nd c. CE Peripatetic) reports faithfully, any use of (CR)\nwhich transforms a syllogism into a first figure syllogism was such a\nreduction. The large number of modes and reductions can be explained\nby the fact that Theophrastus did not have the logical means for\nsubstituting negative for positive components in an argument. In later\nantiquity, after some intermediate stages, and possibly under Stoic\ninfluence, the wholly hypothetical syllogisms were interpreted as\npropositional-logical arguments of the kind\n\n\nIf p, then q.\n If q, then r.\n Therefore, if p, then r.\n\n\n",
