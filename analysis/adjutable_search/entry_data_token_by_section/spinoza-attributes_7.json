    "main_text": "Attributes in the Ethics || The Two Known Attributes\n1.7 The Two Known Attributes\n\nSpinoza famously claims that we, human minds, only know two\nattributes\u2014Thought and Extension. This can be seen as arising\nfrom the axioms in Part Two: 2A2: \u201cMan thinks,\u201d 2A4:\n\u201cWe feel a certain body is affected in many ways,\u201d 2A5:\n\u201cWe neither feel nor perceive any singular things, except bodies\nand modes of thinking,\u201d as well as 2P13: \u201cThe object of\nthe idea constituting the human mind is the body, or\n[sive] a certain mode of extension which actually exists,\nand nothing else\u201d [italics added] (this is true already\nin KV, 1/27). In Letter 64 Spinoza tries to explain why we can only\nperceive these two attributes, and he does so by referring back to\n2P13 and claims in the letter: \u201cTherefore, the mind\u2019s\npower of understanding extends only as far as that which this idea of\nthe body contains within itself, or which follows therefrom. Now this\nidea of the body involves and expresses no other attributes of God\nthan extension and thought.\u201d Although some have found this line\nof argumentation unsatisfying (e.g. Bennett, 1984, 78\u201379) it is\nworth noting that Spinoza here is relying on axioms.\n",
