    "main_text": "What is Time Travel? || Changing the Past\n1.2 Changing the Past\nBefore leaving the question \u2018What is time travel?\u2019 we\nshould note the crucial distinction between changing the past and\nparticipating in (aka affecting or influencing) the\npast.[11] In the\npopular imagination, backwards time travel would allow one to change\nthe past: to right the wrongs of history, to prevent one\u2019s\nyounger self doing things one later regretted, and so on. In a model\nwith a single past, however, this idea is incoherent: the very\ndescription of the case involves a contradiction (e.g. the time\ntraveller burns all her diaries at midnight on her fortieth birthday\nin 1976, and does not burn all her diaries at midnight on her fortieth\nbirthday in 1976). It is not as if there are two versions of the past:\nthe original one, without the time traveller present, and then a\nsecond version, with the time traveller playing a role. There is just\none past\u2014and two perspectives on it: the perspective of\nthe younger self, and the perspective of the older time travelling\nself. If these perspectives are inconsistent (e.g. an event occurs in\none but not the other) then the time travel scenario is\nincoherent.\n\n\nThis means that time travellers can do less than we might have hoped:\nthey cannot right the wrongs of history; they cannot even stir a speck\nof dust on a certain day in the past if, on that day, the speck was in\nfact unmoved. But this does not mean that time travellers\nmust be entirely powerless in the past: while they cannot do anything\nthat did not actually happen, they can (in principle) do\nanything that did happen. Time travellers cannot change the\npast: they cannot make it different from the way it was\u2014but they\ncan participate in it: they can be amongst the people who did make the\npast the way it\n was.[12]\n\n\nWhat about models involving two temporal dimensions, or parallel\nuniverses\u2014do they allow for coherent scenarios in which the past\nis changed?[13] \nThere is certainly no contradiction in saying that the\ntime traveller burns all her diaries at midnight on her fortieth\nbirthday in 1976 in universe 1 (or at\nhypertime A), and does not burn all her diaries at\nmidnight on her fortieth birthday in 1976 in universe 2\n(or at hypertime B). The question is whether\nthis kind of story involves changing the past in the sense\noriginally envisaged: righting the wrongs of history, preventing\nsubsequently regretted actions, and so on. Goddu (2003) and van \nInwagen (2010) argue that it does (in the context of particular\nhypertime models), while Smith\n(1997, 365\u20136; 2015) argues that it does not: that it\ninvolves avoiding the past\u2014leaving it untouched while\ntravelling to a different version of the past in which things proceed\ndifferently.\n",
