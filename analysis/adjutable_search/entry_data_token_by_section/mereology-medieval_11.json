    "main_text": "Parts || Parts of potential wholes\n3.4 Parts of potential wholes\n\nPotential wholes add further complications. Like genera, and unlike\nintegral wholes, it is usually assumed that potential wholes are not\nliterally composed out of their parts. Potential wholes, or at least\nthe subjects underlying them, are items that are fundamentally simple.\nBut, in another respect, the parts of the potential whole behave like\nparts of an integral whole. Different souls can possess only a\nselection of the capacities associated with soul, and so in a sense,\nthere is a construction of a specific soul\u2019s total capacity out\nof many discrete capacities and powers. And no one power by itself\nexhibits or stands in for the whole soul.\n\nThe question thus arises as to how one can distinguish powers as parts\nfrom both subjective and integral parts. Here we will look briefly at\nonly one account. Aquinas separates potential wholes from both\nuniversals and integral wholes by considering two parameters: the\npresence of the whole in the part with respect to the whole\u2019s\nessence, and the presence of the whole in the part with respect to the\nwhole\u2019s power (Summa Theologiae I, q. 77, art. 1, ad\n1). The universal whole \u201cis present to each of its parts in its\nentire essence and power\u201d. It is for this reason that each part\nof the universal is a subjective part. In contrast, the integral whole\nis not in each of its parts either in respect to its entire essence or\nin respect to its power. Hence, the integral whole is not predicable\nof any one of its parts taken singularly. Finally, the potential whole\nis present to each of its parts with respect to its entire essence,\nbut not with respect to its full power. This is why, even though\none\u2019s soul is non-composite and cannot be cut up, the operation\nof thinking does not entail along with it the operation of\nsensing.\n",
