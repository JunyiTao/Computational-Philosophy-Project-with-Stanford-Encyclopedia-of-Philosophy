    "main_text": "Active Intellect, Human Intellect, Immortality, and Prophecy || Prophecy: Overflow, Actualization, Fitness, and the Naturalized Divine\n6.5 Prophecy: Overflow, Actualization, Fitness, and the Naturalized Divine\n\n\nThe active intellect is a divine intermediary. Not only is it a cosmic\noverflow whose ultimate source is God Himself, and not only does it\nstands as governor of sublunar existence and key illuminating source\nin all human intellection, but active intellect is additionally\nidentified as the divine intermediary for prophecy. As Maimonides\nnotes,\n\n\nKnow that the true reality and quiddity of prophecy consists in its\nbeing an overflow overflowing from God, may He be cherished and\nhonored, through the intermediation of the active intellect\u2026 (G\n2.36, P 369)\n\n\n\n\nAnd, drawing upon the epistemological ideas found in his Islamic\nphilosophical milieu, he describes this process further in terms of\nactive intellect's causing the human intellect to \u201cpass from\npotentiality to actuality\u201d (G 2.38, P 377). \n\n\nAt the heart of this epistemology is a notion of human receptivity; in\nline with our discussion of al-Farabian vs. Avicennian epistemology\nabove, we might describe this receptivity in one of three ways: (1)\nthe soul\u2019s receiving an overflow of intelligibles from active\nintellect, (2) the soul\u2019s receiving an overflow of representations of\nintelligibles from active intellect, or (3) the soul\u2019s receiving an\noverflow from active intellect which enables it to abstract\nintelligibles from the sensory world). There emerges additionally a\nnotion of human fitness: human happiness is, as al-Farabi says,\n\u201cgiven to the possible beings capable of receiving it\u201d\n(PR, N1 35). For al-Farabi, human beings possess different natural\ndispositions, leaving some of them unable\u2014by their very\nnature\u2014to ever rise to the level of human perfection:\n\n\n\u2026not every man is equipped by natural disposition to receive\nthe first intelligibles, because individual human being are made by\nnature with unequal powers and different preparations\u2026 (PR, N1\n35)\n\n\n\n\nMaimonides here too appears to follow al-Farabi's treatment. Speaking\nof the overflow from active intellect, Maimonides remarks that it is\nthat \u201cthrough which there is a difference of rank between our\nintellects \u201d (G 2.37, P 373), and speaks too of the\n\u201cnatural disposition\u201d of different people's imaginative\nfaculties (G 2.36, P 369), speaking in various ways throughout the\nGuide of the natural aptitudes of humans and how some people are\nsimply not as disposed towards intellectual apprehension as others:\nsome souls are more fit than others.\n\n\nIt is for the most fit of human souls, then, that we can expect the\nhighest level of conjunction with the active\nintellect.[22]\nIt is precisely this corollary to the theory of human intellection\nwhich lies at the heart of the Islamic philosophical\u2014and with\nit, the Maimonidean\u2014understanding of prophecy. Prophecy is a\nnatural phenomenon, stemming precisely from the cosmological structure\nof reality and the epistemological/psychological structure of human\nminds.  The prophet is, in this context, the person whose ability to\nreceive the overflow from active intellect is especially superb. And,\nfollowing on this naturalized tradition of prophecy, there will be\ndifferent levels of prophecy\u2014as well as different levels of\nprovidence\u2014corresponding to different levels of engagement with\nthe overflow from active \nintellect.[23]\n\n\n\nThe active intellect in these traditions is a natural cosmic mechanism\nat play in human knowledge, but also in prophecy (as well as in\nprovidence and immortality). It is in this sense that such\ntraditions\u2014including Maimonides\u2014are often described as\nholding \u201cnaturalized\u201d theories of prophecy. Following this\nnaturalizing tendency further, we might note the fluid back and forth\nbetween natural and supernatural descriptions of the active intellect\nand other cosmic processes: In this context, the angels (the divine\nemissaries, as it were) are identified with the separate intellects,\nand active intellect in particular emerges as the bearer\u2014or\neven, messenger\u2014of prophecy to the human intellect. In this\nspirit, we find in Maimonides and in his Islamic predecessors\ndescriptions of the active intellect in divine terms. For example,\nreturning to the context in which Maimonides explains the Biblical\nnotion (Genesis 1:26-27) of man's being created in the image of God in\nterms of man's possession of an intellectual faculty, we find the\ndescription of the active intellect\u2014whence man's own intellect\nreceives its power\u2014as a \u201cdivine intellect\u201d:\n\n\n\u2026It was because of this something, I mean because of the divine\nintellect (al-\u2018aql al-il\u0101h\u012b) conjoined\n(al-mutta\u1e63il) with man, that it is said of the latter\nthat he is in the image of God and in His likeness\u2026 (G\n1.1, P 23; Pines' use of italics indicates Maimonides' use of Hebrew\nin his text; for Arabic see Munk 1931, 15).\n\n\n\n\nTurning to al-Farabi we readily see the divine descriptions of this\nnatural cosmic principle at play as well:\n\n\n\u2026of the active intellect it ought to be said that it is the\ntrustworthy spirit and the holy spirit; and it is called by names\nresembling these \ntwo\u2026\u201d[24]\n\n\n\nDescribing active intellect in this same sacred way in another text,\nand identifying it further in this regard as the agent of revelation,\nal-Farabi, in the context of describing the virtuous ruler of the\nvirtuous city in the Book of Religion, speaks of\n\n\n\u2026the spiritual being governing the king who is the first ruler\nof the virtuous city, namely the one set down as the trustworthy\nspirit, and this is the one through which God, may He be exalted,\ncommunicates the revelation to the first ruler of the city\u2026(BR,\nB 111, section 26).\n\n\n\nFollowing on the general association (described above) of the cosmic\nseparate intellects with angels (with the active intellect emerging in\nparticular as the angel Gabriel), here and above, al-Farabi correlates\nthe active intellect to the Trustworthy Spirit of Quran XXVI, 193,\nidentifying the active intellect as the agent of prophetic\nrevelation.\n\n\nIt is in this spirit that we can approach Maimonides' own account of\nactive intellect as a divine overflow responsible for prophecy.\nFollowing al-Farabi's idea above, Maimonides speaks of the perfected\nhuman being as having his intellect in most full contact with the\nactive intellect, speaking in terms of \u201cthe intellect that God\nmade overflow (af\u0101\u1e0da) unto man\u201d (G 1.2, P\n24; Munk 1931, 16). And with al-Farabi, Maimonides too identifies this\nmost perfected human intellectual state as the state of\nprophecy. Speaking of prophecy as active intellect's mediation of\ndivine overflow onto man, Maimonides adds,\n\n\n\u2026This is the highest degree of man and the ultimate term of\nperfection that can exist for his species\u2026 (G 2.36, P 369)\n\n\n\nWhile the mechanics of active intellect point to a naturalizing\ntendency in Maimonides' philosophical treatment of prophecy, we must\nnot lose sight of what at least prima facie appears in 2.32\nto be a more robust role for God in this story. \u201cThe opinions of\npeople concerning prophecy are like their opinion concerning the\neternity of the world or its creation in time\u2026\u201d (G 2.32,\nP 361) After addressing two other views of prophecy (one of which is\ndescribed as the completely naturalized view held by the\nphilosophers), Maimonides goes on to recount the \u201copinion of our\nLaw,\u201d which he contrasts from the completely naturalized view as\nfollows:\n\n\n[This third opinion, viz., \u201cthe opinion of our\nLaw\u201d] is identical with the philosophic opinion except in one\nthing. For we believe that it may happen that one who is fit for\nprophecy and prepared for it should not become a prophet, namely, on\naccount of the divine will. To my mind this is like all the miracles\nand takes the same course as they\u2026 (G 2.32, P 361)\n\n\n\n\nThis view is sometimes described as a \u201cdivine veto\u201d view:\nwhile with the philosophers Maimonides understands prophecy as a\nnatural human encounter with active intellect, he here adds the idea\nthat God has the power to prevent\u2014or\n\u201cveto\u201d\u2014this natural phenomenon from leading to\nprophecy if He were to so desire. It is not at all clear, however, how\nwe ought take this caveat. Together with his view on creation,\nMaimonides' view on the exact mechanics of prophecy\u2014and the\nsupra-natural role, if any, of God in that mechanics\u2014is open to\nscholarly debate.  It is in part difficult to know for certain what\nMaimonides has in mind here since, as above in the case of creation,\nthere are arguably different ways\u2014some more naturalized than\nothers\u2014that one might understand Maimonides' notion of\n\u201cdivine Will,\u201d and hence, arguably different ways that one\nmight understand the import of the above claim from 2.32. There are,\nhence, arguably different ways that one might understand the exact\nmechanics of Maimonidean prophecy and the role that God plays in that\nmechanics at 2.32 and in the Guide more broadly.\n\n\nWe might also note that to the extent that one sees in Maimonides a\nsense that the prophet is able to arrive at truths intuitively and\ndirectly without the ordinary processes of reasoning (as one seems to\nfind in Guide 2.38), one might detect the influence of Avicenna (See\nPines 1969, ci-ciii).
