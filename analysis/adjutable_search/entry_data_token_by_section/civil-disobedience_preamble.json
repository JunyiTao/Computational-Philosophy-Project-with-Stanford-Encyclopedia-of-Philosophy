    "main_text": "\n\nFrom the Boston Tea Party to Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Salt March, and\nfrom suffragists\u2019 illegally casting their ballots to whites-only\nlunch counter sit-ins, civil disobedience has often played a crucial\nrole in bending the proverbial arc of the moral universe toward\njustice. But what, if anything, do these acts, and countless others\nwhich we refer to as civil disobedience have in common? What\ndistinguishes them from other forms of conscientious and political\naction?\n\nOn the most widely accepted account, civil disobedience is a public,\nnon-violent and conscientious breach of law undertaken with the aim of\nbringing about a change in laws or government policies (Rawls 1999,\n320). On this account, people who engage in civil disobedience operate\nat the boundary of fidelity to law, have general respect for their\nregime, and are willing to accept the legal consequences of their\nactions, as evidence of their fidelity to the rule of law. Civil\ndisobedience, given its place at the boundary of fidelity to law, is\nsaid on this view to fall between legal protest, on the one hand, and\nconscientious refusal, uncivil disobedience, militant protest,\norganized forcible resistance, and revolutionary action, on the other\nhand.\n\nThis picture of civil disobedience, and the broader accounts offered\nin response, will be examined in the first section of this entry,\nwhich considers conceptual issues. The second section contrasts civil\ndisobedience, broadly, with other types of protest. The third focuses\non the justification of civil disobedience, examining upstream why\ncivil disobedience needs to be justified, and downstream what is its\nvalue and role in society. The fourth examines states\u2019\nappropriate responses to civil disobedience.\n",
