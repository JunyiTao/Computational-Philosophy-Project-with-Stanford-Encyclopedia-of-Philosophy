    "main_text": "Aristotelian Teleology\n9. Aristotelian Teleology\n\n\n           \nWe may mainly pass over as uncontroversial the suggestion that there\nare efficient causes in favor of the most controversial and difficult\nof Aristotle four causes, the final\n cause.[19] \n We should note before doing so, however, that Aristotle\u2019s commitment\nto efficient causation does receive a defense in Aristotle\u2019s preferred\nterminology; he thus does more than many other philosophers who take\nit as given that causes of an efficient sort are operative. Partly by\nway of criticizing Plato\u2019s theory of Forms, which he regards as\ninadequate because of its inability to account for change and\ngeneration, Aristotle observes that nothing potential can bring itself\ninto actuality without the agency of an actually operative efficient\ncause. Since what is potential is always in potentiality relative to\nsome range of actualities, and nothing becomes actual of its own\naccord\u2014no pile of bricks, for instance, spontaneously organizes\nitself into a house or a wall\u2014an actually operative agent is\nrequired for every instance of change.  This is the efficient\ncause. These sorts of considerations also incline Aristotle to speak\nof the priority of actuality over potentiality: potentialities are\nmade actual by actualities, and indeed are always potentialities for\nsome actuality or other.  The operation of some actuality upon some\npotentiality is an instance of efficient causation.\n\nThat said, most of Aristotle\u2019s readers do not find themselves in need\nof a defense of the existence of efficient causation.  By contrast,\nmost think that Aristotle does need to provide a defense of final\ncausation. It is natural and easy for us to recognize final causal\nactivity in the products of human craft: computers and can-openers are\ndevices dedicated to the execution of certain tasks, and both their\nformal and material features will be explained by appeal to their\nfunctions. Nor is it a mystery where artefacts obtain their functions:\nwe give artefacts their functions. The ends of artefacts are the results of\nthe designing activities of intentional agents. Aristotle recognizes\nthese kinds of final causation, but also, and more problematically,\nenvisages a much greater role for teleology in natural explanation:\nnature exhibits teleology without design. He thinks, for instance,\nthat living organisms not only have parts which require teleological\nexplanation\u2014that, for instance, kidneys are for\npurifying the blood and teeth are for tearing and chewing\nfood\u2014but that whole organisms, human beings and other animals,\nalso have final causes. \n\n\nCrucially, Aristotle denies overtly that the causes operative in\nnature are intention-dependent. He thinks, that is, that\norganisms have final causes, but that they did not come to have them by\ndint of the designing activities of some intentional agent or\nother. He thus denies that a necessary condition of\nx\u2019s having a final cause is x\u2019s being\ndesigned. \n\n\nAlthough he has been persistently criticized for his commitment to\nsuch natural ends, Aristotle is not susceptible to a fair number of\nthe objections standardly made to his view.  Indeed, it is evident\nthat whatever the merits of the most penetrating of such criticisms,\nmuch of the contumely directed at Aristotle is stunningly\n illiterate.[20]  \n To take but one of any number of mind-numbing examples, the famous\nAmerican psychologist B. F. Skinner reveals that \u2018Aristotle\nargued that a falling body accelerated because it grew more jubilant\nas it found itself nearer its home\u2019 (1971, 6). To anyone who has\nactually read Aristotle, it is unsurprising that this ascription comes\nwithout an accompanying textual citation.  For Aristotle, as Skinner\nwould portray him, rocks are conscious beings having end states which\nthey so delight in procuring that they accelerate themselves in\nexaltation as they grow ever closer to attaining them. There is no\nexcuse for this sort of intellectual slovenliness, when already by the\nlate-nineteenth century, the German scholar Zeller was able to say\nwith perfect accuracy that \u2018The most important feature of the\nAristotelian teleology is the fact that it is neither anthropocentric\nnor is it due to the actions of a creator existing outside the world\nor even of a mere arranger of the world, but is always thought of as\nimmanent in nature\u2019 (1883, \u00a748).\n\n\n           \nIndeed, it is hardly necessary to caricature Aristotle\u2019s\nteleological commitments in order to bring them into critical\nfocus. In fact, Aristotle offers two sorts of defenses of\nnon-intentional teleology in nature, the first of which is replete with\ndifficulty. He claims in Physics ii 8:\nFor these [viz. teeth and all other parts of natural\nbeings] and all other natural things come about as they do either\nalways or for the most part, whereas nothing which comes about due to\nchance or spontaneity comes about always or for the most part. \n\u2026 If, then, these are either the result of coincidence or for the\nsake of something, and they cannot be the result of coincidence or\nspontaneity, it follows that they must be for the sake of\nsomething. Moreover, even those making these sorts of claims\n[viz. that everything comes to be by necessity] will agree that such\nthings are natural. Therefore, that for the sake of which is\npresent among things which come to be and exist by nature.\n(Phys. 198b32\u2013199a8)\n\n\nThe argument here, which has been variously formulated\n by\n scholars,[21]\nseems doubly problematic. \n\n\n           \nIn this argument Aristotle seems to introduce as a phainomenon\nthat nature exhibits regularity, so that the parts of nature come about\nin patterned and regular ways.   Thus, for instance, humans\ntend to have teeth arranged in a predictable sort of way, with incisors\nin the front and molars in the back. He then seems to contend, as\nan exhaustive and exclusive disjunction, that things happen either by\nchance or for the sake of something, only to suggest, finally, that\nwhat is \u2018always or for the most part\u2019\u2014what happens in\na patterned and predictable way\u2014is not plausibly thought to be\ndue to chance. Hence, he concludes, whatever happens always or\nfor the most part must happen for the sake of something, and so must\nadmit of a teleological cause. Thus, teeth show up always or for\nthe most part with incisors in the front and molars in the back; since\nthis is a regular and predictable occurrence, it cannot be due to\nchance. Given that whatever is not due to chance has a final\ncause, teeth have a final cause.\n\n\n           \nIf so much captures Aristotle\u2019s dominant argument for teleology, then\nhis view is unmotivated. The argument is problematic in the first\ninstance because it assumes an exhaustive and exclusive disjunction\nbetween what is by chance and what is for the sake of something. But\nthere are obviously other possibilities. Hearts beat not in order to\nmake noise, but they do so always and not by chance.  Second, and this\nis perplexing if we have represented him correctly, Aristotle is\nhimself aware of one sort of counterexample to this view and is indeed\nkeen to point it out himself: although, he insists, bile is regularly\nand predictably yellow, its being yellow is neither due simply to\nchance nor for the sake of anything. Aristotle in fact mentions many\nsuch counterexamples (Part. An. 676b16\u2013677b10,\nGen. An. 778a29\u2013b6). It seems to follow, then, short of\nascribing a straight contradiction to him, either that he is not\ncorrectly represented as we have interpreted this argument or that he\nsimply changed his mind about the grounds of teleology. Taking up\nthe first alternative, one possibility is that Aristotle is not really\ntrying to argue for teleology from the ground up in\nPhysics ii 8, but is taking it as already established that\nthere are teleological causes, and restricting himself to observing\nthat many natural phenomena, namely those which occur always or for the\nmost part, are good candidates for admitting of teleological\nexplanation.\n\n\n           \nThat would leave open the possibility of a broader sort of motivation\nfor teleology, perhaps of the sort Aristotle offers elsewhere in the\nPhysics, when speaking about the impulse to find\nnon-intention-dependent teleological causes at work in nature:\nThis is most obvious in the case of animals other than man:\nthey make things using neither craft nor on the basis of inquiry nor by\ndeliberation. This is in fact a source of puzzlement for those\nwho wonder whether it is by reason or by some other faculty that these\ncreatures work\u2014spiders, ants and the like. Advancing bit by\nbit in this same direction it becomes apparent that even in plants\nfeatures conducive to an end occur\u2014leaves, for example, grow in\norder to provide shade for the fruit. If then it is both by\nnature and for an end that the swallow makes its nest and the spider\nits web, and plants grow leaves for the sake of the fruit and send\ntheir roots down rather than up for the sake of nourishment, it is\nplain that this kind of cause is operative in things which come to be\nand are by nature. And since nature is twofold, as matter and as\nform, the form is the end, and since all other things are for sake of\nthe end, the form must be the cause in the sense of that for the sake\nof which. (Phys. 199a20\u201332)\n\n\nAs Aristotle quite rightly observes in this passage, we find\nourselves regularly and easily speaking in teleological terms when\ncharacterizing non-human animals and plants. It is consistent\nwith our so speaking, of course, that all of our easy language in these\ncontexts is rather too easy: it is in fact lax and careless, because unwarrantedly\nanthropocentric. We might yet demand that all such language be\nassiduously reduced to some non-teleological idiom when we are being\nscientifically strict and empirically serious, though we would first\nneed to survey the explanatory costs and benefits of our attempting to\ndo so. Aristotle considers and rejects some views hostile to\nteleology in Physics ii 8 and Generation and\nCorruption\n i.[22] \n",
