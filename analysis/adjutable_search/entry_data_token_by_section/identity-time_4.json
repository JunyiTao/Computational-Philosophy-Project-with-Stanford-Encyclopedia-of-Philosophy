    "main_text": "Necessary and Determinate Identities\n3. Necessary and Determinate Identities\n\nHere are two examples of identity statements:\n\n(i) The table in the next room is (now) identical with my favorite\ntable.\n\n\n(ii) The table in the next room is identical with the one you\npurchased last year.\n\n\n(i) and (ii) are contingent. Even if the table in the next room is my\nfavorite table, it might not have been. Even if the table in the next\nroom is the one you purchased last year, it might not have been. One\nof the most important discussions of identity is to be found in Saul\nKripke's paper \u2018Identity and Necessity\u2019 and his book\nNaming and Necessity (in Munitz 1971, Kripke 1980). One\nlesson to be learned from Kripke's discussion is that it is\nillegitimate to infer from identity statements such as (i) and (ii)\nhaving their truth value contingently that the relation of identity\ncan hold contingently.\n\nWhy is this inference illegitimate? Compare (i) with:\n\n(iii) The table in the next room is the same size as my favorite\ntable.\n\n\nBeing the same size as is an equivalence relation that holds\ncontingently. What does it take for that relation to hold contingently\nbetween the table in the next room and my favorite table? Thinking in\nterms of possible worlds the table in the next room is contingently\nthe same size as my favorite table just in case the following is so.\nThe table in the next room is the same size as my favorite table, but,\nin some possible world W, something identical to (or a\ncounterpart of) the actual table in the next room is not the same size\nas what is actually my favorite table.\n\nWithout having recourse to possible worlds, what this comes to is that\nthe table in the next room is contingently the same size as my\nfavorite table only if, in addition to (iii), the following is\ntrue:\n\n(iv) (\u2203x)(\u2203y)[(x = the table in the next room)\n& (y = my favorite table) & (possibly, x is\nnot the same size as y)].\n\n\nLikewise the table in the next room is contingently identical with my\nfavorite table only if, in some world W, what is actually my\nfavorite table is not identical with what is actually the table in the\nnext room. That condition need not be satisfied for (i) to be\ncontingently true. All it takes for (i) to be contingently true is\nthat, for example, (i) is true, but in some world W something\nqualifies as my favorite table without also qualifying as the table in\nthe next room. For that to be so nothing need be identical, or\ncounterpart related, across worlds.\n\nKripke and Ruth Barcan Marcus offer an argument to show that there are\nno contingent identities. Here is one version of that argument often\nreferred to as the Modal Argument for the Necessity of Identities:\n\nSuppose:\n\n(1) a=b.\n\n\nBut each thing is necessarily identical with itself. Hence;\n\n(2) \u25a1 (a=a)\n\n\nTaking \u2018[\u03bbx\u00a0\u03a6]\u2019 to mean: being an\nx such that \u03a6 (where \u03a6 is some logical formula in\nwhich \u2018x\u2019 is a free variable), we supposedly\nhave:\n\n(3) [\u03bbx\u00a0\u25a1(x=a)]a\n\n\nSince, by Leibniz's Law, if (1) then a and b share\nall properties in common. Hence (1) and (3) yield:\n\n(4) [\u03bbx\u00a0\u25a1(x=a)]b\n\n\nwhich in turn yields:\n\n(5) \u25a1(a=b).\n\n\nThough widely accepted this type of argument can be contested.\nLeibniz's Law, again understood as ranging over identity properties,\nis used to derive step (4)\u2014b has the property of being\nnecessarily identical with a\u2014from step (3), a\nhas the property of being necessarily identical with a. We\nmight deny that there are any such modal properties. Doing so blocks\nthe argument if the application of LL is restricted to properties.\nAlternatively we might allow that there are such properties as being\nnecessarily identical with a, but deny that (3) follows from\n(2). On one view all that follows from (2) is that a has the\nproperty of being necessarily identical with itself expressed by the\npredicate\n\u2018[\u03bbx\u00a0x=x]\u2019. We need\nto distinguish the property of being necessarily identical with\nitself, which every existent has, from the property of being\nnecessarily identical with a\u2014which only a has\n(Lowe 1982). Finally, we might reject (2) on the following grounds.\nThere is a well entrenched convention that repeated tokens of the same\ntype of name, constant or variable are assigned the same value. From\nthe existence of this convention it follows that \u2018a =\na\u2019 expresses a truth. It does not follow that\n\u2018a = a\u2019 expresses something necessarily\ntrue.\n\nHere is one way of making clear why it does not follow. According to\nwhat we may call the identity convention two tokens of the same name\nstandardly refer to the same thing. So in, for example, the sentence\n\u2018Napoleon admires Napoleon\u2019 we are, unless otherwise\nindicated, to take the second occurrence of \u2018Napoleon\u2019 to\nhave a referent identical with the referent of the first. In the case\nof \u2018Napoleon admires Napoleon\u2019 the relation Napoleon is\nsaid to stand in to himself is different from the relation governing\nthe repeated use of a proper name. In the one case it is the relation\nof admiration. In the other it is identity. But, suppose they were the\nsame relation. Suppose, the repeated use of a proper name were\ngoverned, not by the identity convention, but by what we may call the\nadmiration convention. According to the admiration convention a\nsubsequent occurrence of a proper name in a sentence should be taken\nto refer to something only if it is admired by the referent of the\nfirst occurrence. In the light of this, admittedly bizarre, convention\nwhat should we say about the truth value of \u2018Napoleon admires\nNapoleon\u2019. Well if the second occurrence of\n\u2018Napoleon\u2019 refers, it will refer to someone admired by the\nreferent of the first occurrence. So, if the admiration convention is\nadhered to, \u2018Napoleon admires Napoleon\u2019 will, if it\nexpresses any proposition, will express a true one. Despite that,\n\u2018Napoleon admires Napoleon\u2019 expresses a contingent truth.\nLikewise, \u2018a=a\u2019 expresses a true proposition\nif it expresses any proposition at all, since the relation governing\nthe repeated use of \u2018a\u2019 is the same as the one that\na is said to stand in to a. But, as with \u2018Napoleon admires\nNapoleon\u2019 given the admiration convention, there is no reason to\nsuppose that the truth expressed by \u2018a=a\u2019 is\na necessary one. A like observation applies to \u2018a is\nidentical with itself\u2019.\n\nPhilosophers have appealed to contingent identities to solve identity\npuzzles. They have also appealed to vague or indeterminate identities\nto solve such puzzles. Consider a club that over an extended time\nchanges its rules, membership and location. Is the original club\nidentical with the club having a new location, rules and membership?\nCall the original club the Identity Club, and the club with new rules,\nmembership and location the Constitution Club. Is the following\ntrue?:\n\nC: The Identity Club = The Constitution Club.\n\n\nSome would say that that the identity stated by C is vague or\nindeterminate. What does it mean to say that an identity is vague or\nindeterminate? At least this. C is not determinately true, or\ndeterminately false. If C does lack a determinate truth value, is that\nenough to ensure that the identity of the clubs referred to by C is\nindeterminate?\n\nIn the case of the identity sentence:\n\n(i) The table in the next room is (now) identical with my favorite\ntable.\n\n\nwe saw the need to distinguish between (i) having its truth value\ncontingently, and (i) stating an identity that holds only\ncontingently. We likewise need to distinguish C having an\nindeterminate truth value from C stating an identity that holds only\nindeterminately. C may lack a determinate truth value because one, or\nboth, of the referring expressions \u2018The Identity Club\u2019 and\n\u2018The Constitution Club\u2019 lacks a determinate referent.\nNevertheless for any determinate choice of referents for those\nexpressions C has a determinate truth value.\n\nCan it happen that the referring expressions \u2018a\u2019\nand \u2018b\u2019 refer precisely in the identity sentence\n\u2018a=b\u2019 without that sentence being\ndeterminately true or false? Here is one version of an argument, due\nto Gareth Evans and Nathan Salmon, that is supposed to show that it\ncannot (Evans 1978, Salmon 1981). Let \u2018Ip\u2019 mean:\nit is indeterminate whether p, that is p is neither\ndeterminately true nor determinately false, and let\n\u2018Dp\u2019 mean: it is determinate that p. We\nhave:\n\n(1\u2032) I(a=b).\n\n\nBut:\n\n(2\u2032) D (a=a).\n\n\n(2\u2019) yields:\n\n(3\u2032)\n[\u03bbx\u00a0D(x=a)]a\n\n\nSuppose:\n\n(4\u2032) a=b\n\n\nApplying Leibniz's Law to (3\u2032) and (4\u2032) gives:\n\n(5\u2032)\n[\u03bbx\u00a0D(a=x)]b\n\n\nfrom which it follows that:\n\n(6\u2032) D(a=b),\n\n\nwhich contradicts (1\u2032). Hence (1\u2032) implies:\n\n(7\u2032) \u00ac(a=b)\n\n\nIf (7\u2032) is true then it is not true that a is identical\nwith b. So if (7\u2032) is true, a is determinately\ndistinct from b. (1\u2032) cannot be true.\n\nOf course, defenders of indeterminate identity do not let this pass\nunquestioned. One assumption of the argument is that (7\u2032)\nimplies that a is determinately distinct from b\nrather than just that a is not determinately identical with\nb.\n\nArguments against contingent and indeterminate identities appeal to\nLeibniz's Law. Seen as a principle about the transmission of\nproperties across identity Leibniz's Law has rarely been challenged.\nStill, it has been challenged. One interesting challenge is brought by\nBenjamin Schnieder in Schnieder 2006. Similarly, Evans' argument has\nbeen challenged from a number of directions. A recent challenger is\nElizabeth Barnes who in Barnes 2009 invokes counterpart theory to\ndefuse it.\n",
