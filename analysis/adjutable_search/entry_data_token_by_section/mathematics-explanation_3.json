    "main_text": "Mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences || Mathematical models and idealization\n1.3 Mathematical models and idealization\n\nOne assumption of the Aristotelian tradition that is often\nunquestioned in the work summarized in section 1.2 is that whatever\nprovides the explanation (i.e. the explanans) must be true.\nPhilosophical investigations of scientific models and how these models\nmay explain have convinced many that an explanans need not be true.\nThe argument for this conclusion is straightforward: Scientific models\nexplain and scientific models are not true. So, truth is not required\nfor explanation (Bokulich 2011; see also Cartwright 1983, Morrison\n2015, Rice 2018 and Yablo 2020).\n\nA traditional response to this argument is that even though models are\nnot true, a model can only explain if it generates some truths about\nthe target of explanation (Colyvan 2010, see section 1.4 for more\ndiscussion). That is, a model explains only when it represents its\ntarget to be a certain way. The debate thus turns on the options for\nmaking sense of how models represent, especially when those models are\nmathematical, and if the representational aspects of models are\nsufficient to make sense of model-based explanation. One proposal is\nthat a model explains when the model represents a target system to be\na certain way and also represents something else that explains why the\nsystem is that way. For example, a causal model of outcome \\(E\\) needs\nto represent \\(E\\) and some cause \\(C\\) of \\(E\\). However, there is no\nconsensus on what it takes for a model to represent something.\n\nAs a model is distinct from its target, and the model and target are\noften composed of different materials, it is natural to conclude that\nstructural relations are central to what a model represents. However,\nit is hard to maintain that a model represents a target just in case\nthere is a structural relation between the model and target\n(Su\u00e1rez 2010, 2015). For example, a model is isomorphic to\nitself, and so it stands in a structural relation to itself. But we do\nnot want to say that a model represents itself. There are also\nmodel-target relations that lack any clear structural\ncharacterization. For example, a model may represent the solar system,\nand yet contain only two point particles moving on trajectories that\nfail to stand in any non-trivial structural relation to anything in\nthe actual solar system. So it seems that standing in a structural\nrelation is neither necessary nor sufficient for a model to represent\na target.\n\nOne response to these problems is that a model represents a target\nwhen agents claim that a structural relation obtains between the model\nand the target, where that relation may be quite selective and involve\nreinterpretations of various elements of the model (Pincock 2012, ch.\n2, Frigg & Nguyen 2020). For example, the projection relating a\nmap to some country may be fairly complicated, and involve various\nconventions for what symbols on the map indicate about the country.\nSome authors associate the relations that agents establish between\nmodel and target with inferential principles (Bueno & Colyvan\n2011, Bueno & French 2018). So according to these various\nproposals, a model explains a feature of a target when either some\nrepresentational relationship or inferential licenses from model to\ntarget have been established by agents, and these connections\ngenuinely explain that feature (e.g. they are causes of the feature).\nFor example, a suitably interpreted map can explain the impossibility\nof train travel between two cities by accurately representing the\ntrain network that fails to link those cites.\n\nThe different approaches to explanation surveyed in section 1.2 can\nthen be used to identify explanatory models and what they explain. A\nmechanist about explanation can allow that mathematical models explain\nby representing mechanisms, while difference-making views will require\nan explanatory model to represent difference-making, i.e. how changing\nfactor \\(X\\) will go along with a change in outcome \\(Y\\). All of\nthese proposals will argue that scientific models do not need to be\ntrue in order to explain. All that needs to occur is for the model to\nprovide some truths by representing the right things about the target.\nSo the presence of falsehoods that the model also provides about the\ntarget does not stand in the way of the model\u2019s explanatory\npower.\n\nThis approach to explanatory models and idealization has been called\ninto question by Batterman. One argument from Batterman is that there\nare explanatory models that do not explain in virtue of an element of\nthe model representing some explanatorily relevant factor such as a\ncause or more exotic non-causal difference maker. Instead, in such\ncases, \u201cwhile we have a genuine mathematical explanation of\nphysical phenomena, there is no appeal to the existence of\nmathematical entities or their properties. Instead, the appeal is\nto a mathematical idealization resulting from a limit\noperation that relates one model \u2026 to another\u201d\n(2010, 7\u20138). The case that Batterman is discussing here involves\nan operation (known as taking the thermodynamic limit) that transforms\na \u201cfinite statistical mechanical model\u201d into a\n\u201ccontinuum thermodynamic model\u201d. This is central to the\nexplanation of the universality of some features of phase transitions\nthat include liquid/gas transitions and magnetization. The features\nare universal in the sense that they arise across systems with very\ndifferent microphysical features, and so seem especially puzzling.\n\nOne point that Batterman is making here is that mathematical\noperations that connect models can be significant for a mathematical\nexplanation of an empirical phenomena (see also Batterman & Rice\n2014, Batterman 2019, Batterman 2021). The defenders of traditional\napproaches to model explanation often focus on cases where a single\nmathematical structure is used to explain. However, the basic ideas of\nthe traditional approach can be extended to deal with the explanatory\nsignificance of some mathematical operations. For example, one\nmathematical model may be transformed into another mathematical model\nthrough a mathematical operation. If this operation reflects something\nof explanatory significance, then the two models and the operation\nconnecting them may be central to the explanation. Some idealizations\nare associated with these operations, as in the case where an ocean is\ntreated as infinitely deep or a planet is modeled as a point particle.\nIn such cases, the operations function by changing or removing the\ninterpretation of the elements of the model.\n\nBatterman also develops another point that poses a more significant\nchallenge to traditional approaches to model explanation. This is that\nthe \u201cmathematical idealization\u201d that results from this\noperation, and that is tied to one of these models, is essential to\nthe whole explanation. In the ocean case, there is no temptation to\nsay that the ocean being infinitely deep in one model is explanatorily\nrelevant to the character of the waves on the surface of the actual\nocean. All that this idealization turns on is that the depth is above\nsome threshold. Other cases can be handled using similar\n\u201cGalilean\u201d idealizations that eliminate the falsehood from\nthe genuine explanation (Weisberg 2007). But in Batterman\u2019s\ncases, such as the phase transition case, he is clear that he takes\nthe idealization to be essential to the explanation: \u201cThese\nnontraditional idealizations play essential explanatory roles\ninvolving operations or mathematical processes without\nrepresenting the system(s) in question\u201d (2010, 23). If this\npoint is accepted, then these cases would undermine the scope of the\ntraditional approach.\n\nIn the philosophy of physics there has been an extensive discussion of\nhow essential these idealizations are to the explanations in question\n(Belot 2005, Bokulich 2008, Norton 2012, Lange 2015a, Franklin 2018,\nSullivan 2019, Strevens 2019, Rodriguez 2021. See also Easwaran et al.\n2021). Some critics of Batterman have argued that these cases can be\ndealt with using explanations that avoid these idealizations or that\ntreat these idealizations in the manner that we treated the infinitely\ndeep ocean. Other critics of Batterman have argued that a more\nselective approach to what these models represent allows one to admit\nthat the idealizations are essential to generating the explanation,\nbut that they are not literally to be included in the explanation\nitself. For example, a counterfactual approach to these cases would\nidentify the explanation with some counterfactuals that are generated\nby the model. Batterman and others, in turn, have responded that all\nof these criticisms fail to do justice to the phenomena in question or\nwhat scientists say about their explanations (Morrison 2018, Batterman\n2019, McKenna 2021).\n\nOther alternatives to a traditional approach to mathematical modeling\nand explanation have been developed using other sorts of cases as\ntheir primary motivations (Rizza 2013, Berkovitz 2020, Kasirzadeh\n2021b, McKenna 2022). One theme of this work is a generalization of\nBatterman\u2019s point that scientific explanations often involve\nmany models whose representational relation to the explanatory target\nis more involved than what is usually allowed. For example, Kasirzadeh\nconsiders a case with two mathematical models, with different spatial\nscales, of a process of skin color pattern formation (Kasirzadeh\n2021b). Biologists asked for an explanation of how the two processes\nrelated to one another. Kasirzadeh argues that this explanation\nrequired additional \u201cbridge mathematics\u201d over and above\nthe mathematics found in the original two models. The additional\nmathematics contributed to the explanation by characterizing how the\nmicroscopic processes gave rise to the unexpected macroscopic\nstructures. McKenna goes further and argues for the importance of\ncases where \u201cmodels cannot be stitched together in purely\nmathematical terms\u201d (McKenna 2022). In McKenna\u2019s main case\nvarious models of sea ice permeability are developed for the purposes\nof large-scale climate modeling. No single mathematical model of sea\nice proved to be adequate to supply the right parameters to the\nlarge-scale model. Instead, different models of sea ice were used in\nconjunction with high-resolution empirical data about samples of sea\nice formations. The significance of these cases for the explanations\nthat arise from these modeling techniques is likely to be a subject of\nongoing debate.\n",
