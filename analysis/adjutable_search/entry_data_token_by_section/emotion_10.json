The Motivational Tradition in Affective Science and Its Opponents\n\nThe third tradition in the study of emotions identifies them\nessentially with special kinds of motivational states, where a\nmotivational state broadly understood is an internal cause of\nbehaviors aimed at satisfying a goal. Members of this research\ntradition think that the central problem a theory of emotions needs to\nsolve is explaining how emotions and actions are related, because it\nis ultimately what we do when we emote that produces significant\npersonal and social consequences.\n\nThe Motivational Tradition was anticipated by many theorists of\nemotions in Ancient Greece and throughout the Middle Ages who\nemphasized the constitutive relation between emotions and behavioral\nimpulses (King 2010), but it finds its first modern precursor in Dewey\n(1894, 1895). Dewey was unhappy with the reversal of common sense\nentailed by the Jamesian idea that emotions are feelings that emerge\nin response to proprioceptions. If we truly were angry\nbecause we strike, Dewey countered, anger could not cause the\nstriking, and this would deprive anger, as well as other emotions, of\ntheir explanatory importance.\n\nDewey\u2019s main suggestion was that there is a difference between\nthe feeling of anger and anger itself: an emotion \u201cin its\nentirety\u201d is \u201ca mode of behavior which is purposive\u201d\nand \u201cwhich also reflects itself into feeling\u201d (Dewey 1895:\n15). When we say that someone is angry, Dewey concluded, \u201cwe do\nnot simply, or even chiefly, mean that [such person] has a certain\n\u2018feel\u2019 occupying his consciousness\u201d. Rather,\n\u201c[w]e mean He\u2026has assumed a readiness to act in certain\nways\u201d (Dewey 1895: 16\u201317). The view that emotions are\nessentially either mechanisms that change one\u2019s readiness to act\nor states of action readiness themselves has since been developed in a\nvariety of ways in affective science and in the philosophy of\nemotions. Let us begin from an influential evolutionary variant of the\nMotivational Tradition in affective science.\n",
