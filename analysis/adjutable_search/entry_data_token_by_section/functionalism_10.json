    "main_text": "Varieties of Functionalism || Role-functionalism and Realizer-functionalism\n3.5 Role-functionalism and Realizer-functionalism\n\nTo see the difference between role-functionalism and\nrealizer-functionalism, consider \u2013 once again \u2013 the\n(avowedly simplistic) example of a functional theory of pain\nintroduced in the first section.\n\nPain is the state that tends to be caused by bodily injury,\nto produce the belief that something is wrong with the body and the\ndesire to be out of that state, to produce anxiety, and, in the\nabsence of any stronger, conflicting desires, to cause wincing or\nmoaning. \n\nAs noted earlier, if in humans this functional role is played by\nC-fiber stimulation, then, according to this functionalist theory,\nhumans can be in pain simply by undergoing C-fiber stimulation. But\nthere is a further question to be answered, namely, what is the\nproperty of pain itself? Is it the higher-level relational property of\nbeing in some state or other that plays the \u201cpain role\u201din\nthe theory, or the C-fiber stimulation that actually plays this\nrole?\n\nRole functionalists identify pain with that higher-level relational\nproperty. Realizer functionalists, however, take a functional theory\nmerely to provide definite descriptions of whichever\nlower-level properties satisfy the functional\ncharacterizations. On these views (also called \u201cfunctional\nspecification\u201d theories), if the property that occupies the\ncausal role of pain in human beings is C-fiber stimulation, then pain\n(or at least pain-in-humans) would be C-fiber stimulation,\nrather than the higher-level property of having some lower-level state\nthat plays the relevant role. (This is not to suggest that there is a\ndifference in kind between higher-level \u201crole\u201d properties\nand the lower-level \u201crealizations\u201d of those roles, since\nit may be that, relative to even lower-level descriptions, those\nrealizations can be characterized as functional states themselves\n(Lycan 1987).\n\nSome of the earliest versions of analytic functionalism (Lewis 1966,\nArmstrong 1968 \u2013 but see Lewis 1980, for a modification) were\npresented as functional specification theories, as topic-neutral\n\u201ctranslations\u201d of mental state terms that could pave the\nway for a psycho-physical identity theory by defusing the Distinct\nProperty Argument (see section 3.3). However, if there are differences\nin the physical states that satisfy the functional definitions in\ndifferent (actual or hypothetical) creatures, such theories \u2013\nlike most versions of the identity theory \u2013 would violate a key\nmotivation for functionalism, namely, that creatures with states that\nplay the same role in the production of other mental states and\nbehavior possess, literally, the same mental states.\n\nIt may be that there are some important, more general, physical\nsimilarities between the neural states of seemingly disparate\ncreatures that satisfy a given functional characterization. (This\nissue will be discussed further in Section 6.) However, even if this\nis so, it is unlikely that these similarities hold of all the\ncreatures, including Martians and other hypothetical beings, who could\nshare our functional organization, and thus our theory of mental\nstates would remain, in Block\u2019s (1980) terms, overly\n\u201cchauvinistic\u201d. One could counter the charge of\nchauvinism, of course, by suggesting that all creatures with\nlower-level states that satisfy a given functional characterization\npossess a common (lower-level) disjunctive state or property.\nOr one could suggest that, even if all creatures possessing states\nthat occupy (for example) the pain role are not literally in the same\nmental state, they nonetheless share a closely related higher-level\nproperty (call it, following Lewis 1966 (note 6), \u201cthe attribute\nof having pain\u201d). But neither alternative, for many\nfunctionalists, goes far enough to preserve the basic functionalist\nintuition that functional commonality outweighs physical diversity in\ndetermining whether creatures can possess the same mental states. Thus\nmany functionalists \u2013 both analytic and empirical \u2013\nadvocate role functionalism, which, in addition to avoiding\nchauvinism, permits mental state terms to be rigid designators (Kripke\n1972), denoting the same items \u2013 those higher-level\n\u201crole\u201d properties \u2013 in all possible worlds.\n\nOn the other hand, some functionalists \u2013 here, too, both\nanalytic and empirical \u2013 consider realizer functionalism to be\nin a better position than role functionalism to explain the causal\nefficacy of the mental. If I stub my toe and wince, we believe that my\ntoe stubbing causes my pain, which in turn causes my wincing. But,\nsome have argued (Malcolm 1968; Kim 1989, 1998) that if pain is\nrealized in me by some neural event-type, then insofar as there are\npurely physical law-like generalizations linking events of that type\nwith wincings, one can give a complete causal explanation of my\nwincing by citing the occurrence of that neural event (and the\nproperties by virtue of which it figures in those laws). And thus it\nseems that the higher-level role properties of that event are causally\nirrelevant. This is known as the \u201ccausal exclusion\nproblem\u201d, which is claimed to arise not just for functional role\nproperties, but for dispositional properties in general (Prior,\nPargetter, and Jackson 1982) \u2013 and indeed for any sort of mental\nstates or properties not type-identical to those invoked in physical\nlaws. This problem will be discussed further in Section 5.2.\n",
