    "main_text": "Major Themes in Emerson\u2019s Philosophy || Christianity\n2.4 Christianity\n\nThe son of a Unitarian minister, Emerson attended Harvard Divinity\nSchool and was employed as a minister for almost three years. Yet he\noffers a deeply felt and deeply reaching critique of Christianity in\nthe \u201cDivinity School Address,\u201d flowing from a line of\nargument he establishes in \u201cThe American Scholar.\u201d If the\none thing in the world of value is the active soul, then religious\ninstitutions, no less than educational institutions, must be judged by\nthat standard. Emerson finds that contemporary Christianity deadens\nrather than activates the spirit. It is an \u201cEastern monarchy of\na Christianity\u201d in which Jesus, originally the \u201cfriend of\nman,\u201d is made the enemy and oppressor of man. A Christianity\ntrue to the life and teachings of Jesus should inspire \u201cthe\nreligious sentiment\u201d \u2014 a joyous seeing that is more likely\nto be found in \u201cthe pastures,\u201d or \u201ca boat in the\npond\u201d than in a church. Although Emerson thinks it is a calamity\nfor a nation to suffer the \u201closs of worship\u201d (CW1: 89) he\nfinds it strange that, given the \u201cfamine of our churches\u201d\n(CW1: 85) anyone should attend them. He therefore calls on the\nDivinity School graduates to breathe new life into the old forms of\ntheir religion, to be friends and exemplars to their parishioners, and\nto remember \u201cthat all men have sublime thoughts; that all men\nvalue the few real hours of life; they love to be heard; they love to\nbe caught up into the vision of principles\u201d (CW1: 90).\n",
