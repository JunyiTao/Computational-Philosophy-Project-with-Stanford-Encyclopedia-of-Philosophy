    "main_text": "Terminology\n1. Terminology\n\nThe English word \u201ccharacter\u201d is derived from the Greek\ncharakt\u00ear, which was originally used of a mark\nimpressed upon a coin. Later and more generally,\n\u201ccharacter\u201d came to mean a distinctive mark by which one\nthing was distinguished from others, and then primarily to mean the\nassemblage of qualities that distinguish one individual from another.\nIn modern usage, this emphasis on distinctiveness or individuality\ntends to merge \u201ccharacter\u201d with \u201cpersonality.\u201d\nWe might say, for example, when thinking of a person\u2019s\nidiosyncratic mannerisms, social gestures, or habits of dress, that\n\u201che has personality\u201d or that \u201che\u2019s quite a\ncharacter.\u201d\n\nAs the Introduction above has suggested, however, the philosophical\nuse of the word \u201ccharacter\u201d has a different linguistic\nhistory. At the beginning of Book II of the Nicomachean\nEthics, Aristotle tells us that there are two different kinds of\nhuman excellences, excellences of thought and excellences of\ncharacter. His phrase for excellences of character \u2013\n\u00eathikai aretai \u2013 we usually translate as\n\u201cmoral virtue(s)\u201d or \u201cmoral excellence(s).\u201d\nThe Greek \u00eathikos (ethical) is the adjective cognate\nwith \u00eathos (character). When we speak of a moral virtue\nor an excellence of character, the emphasis is not on mere\ndistinctiveness or individuality, but on the combination of qualities\nthat make an individual the sort of ethically admirable person he\nis.\n\nThis entry will discuss \u201cmoral character\u201d in the Greek\nsense of having or lacking moral virtue. If someone lacks virtue, she\nmay have any of several moral vices, or she may be characterized by a\ncondition somewhere in between virtue and vice, such as continence or\nincontinence.\n",
