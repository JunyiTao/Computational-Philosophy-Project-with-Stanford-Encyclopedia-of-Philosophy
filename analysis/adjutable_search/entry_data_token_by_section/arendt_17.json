    "main_text": "Arendt\u2019s Conception of Citizenship || Citizenship and the Public Sphere\n6.1 Citizenship and the Public Sphere\n\n\nFor Arendt the public sphere comprises two distinct but interrelated\ndimensions. The first is the space of appearance, a space of\npolitical freedom and equality which comes into being whenever\ncitizens act in concert through the medium of speech and\npersuasion. The second is the common world, a shared and\npublic world of human artifacts, institutions and settings which\nseparates us from nature and which provides a relatively permanent and\ndurable context for our activities. Both dimensions are essential to\nthe practice of citizenship, the former providing the spaces where it\ncan flourish, the latter providing the stable background from which\npublic spaces of action and deliberation can arise. For Arendt the\nreactivation of citizenship in the modern world depends upon both the\nrecovery of a common, shared world and the creation of numerous spaces\nof appearance in which individuals can disclose their identities and\nestablish relations of reciprocity and solidarity.\n\n\nThere are three features of the public sphere and of the sphere of\npolitics in general that are central to Arendt\u2019s conception of\ncitizenship. These are, first, its artificial or constructed\nquality; second, its spatial quality; and, third, the\ndistinction between public and private\ninterests.\n\n\nAs regards the first feature, Arendt always stressed the artificiality\nof public life and of political activities in general, the fact that\nthey are man-made and constructed rather than natural or given. She\nregarded this artificiality as something to be celebrated rather than\ndeplored. Politics for her was not the result of some natural\npredisposition, or the realization of the inherent traits of human\nnature. Rather, it was a cultural achievement of the first order,\nenabling individuals to transcend the necessities of life and to\nfashion a world within which free political action and discourse could\nflourish.\n\n\nThe stress on the artificiality of politics has a number of important\nconsequences. For example, Arendt emphasized that the principle of\npolitical equality does not rest on a theory of natural rights or on\nsome natural condition that precedes the constitution of the political\nrealm. Rather, it is an attribute of citizenship which individuals\nacquire upon entering the public realm and which can be secured only by\ndemocratic political institutions.\n\n\nAnother consequence of Arendt\u2019s stress on the artificiality of\npolitical life is evident in her rejection of all neo-romantic appeals\nto the volk and to ethnic identity as the basis for political\ncommunity. She maintained that one\u2019s ethnic, religious, or racial\nidentity was irrelevant to one\u2019s identity as a citizen, and that it\nshould never be made the basis of membership in a political\ncommunity.\n\n\nArendt\u2019s emphasis on the formal qualities of citizenship made her\nposition rather distant from those advocates of participation in the\n1960s who saw it in terms of recapturing a sense of intimacy, of\nwarmth and authenticity. For Arendt political participation was\nimportant because it permitted the establishment of relations of\ncivility and solidarity among citizens. She claimed that the ties of\nintimacy and warmth can never become political since they represent\npsychological substitutes for the loss of the common world.  The only\ntruly political ties are those of civic friendship and solidarity,\nsince they make political demands and preserve reference to the\nworld. For Arendt, therefore, the danger of trying to recapture the\nsense of intimacy and warmth, of authenticity and communal feelings is\nthat one loses the public values of impartiality, civic friendship,\nand solidarity.\n\n\nThe second feature stressed by Arendt has to do with the\nspatial quality of public life, with the fact that political\nactivities are located in a public space where citizens are able to\nmeet one another, exchange their opinions and debate their\ndifferences, and search for some collective solution to their\nproblems. Politics, for Arendt, is a matter of people sharing a common\nworld and a common space of appearance so that public concerns can\nemerge and be articulated from different perspectives. In her view, it\nis not enough to have a collection of private individuals voting\nseparately and anonymously according to their private\nopinions. Rather, these individuals must be able to see and talk to\none another in public, to meet in a public-political space, so that\ntheir differences as well as their commonalities can emerge and become\nthe subject of democratic debate.\n\n\nThis notion of a common public space helps us to understand how\npolitical opinions can be formed which are neither reducible to\nprivate, idiosyncratic preferences, on the one hand, nor to a\nunanimous collective opinion, on the other. Arendt herself distrusted\nthe term \u201cpublic opinion,\u201d since it suggested the mindless\nunanimity of mass society. In her view representative opinions could\narise only when citizens actually confronted one another in a public\nspace, so that they could examine an issue from a number of different\nperspectives, modify their views, and enlarge their standpoint to\nincorporate that of others. Political opinions, she claimed, can never\nbe formed in private; rather, they are formed, tested, and enlarged\nonly within a public context of argumentation and debate.\n\n\nAnother implication of Arendt\u2019s stress on the spatial quality of\npolitics has to do with the question of how a collection of distinct\nindividuals can be united to form a political community. For Arendt\nthe unity that may be achieved in a political community is neither the\nresult of religious or ethnic affinity, not the expression of some\ncommon value system. Rather, the unity in question can be attained by\nsharing a public space and a set of political institutions, and\nengaging in the practices and activities which are characteristic of\nthat space and those institutions.\n\n\nA further implication of Arendt\u2019s conception of the spatial quality of\npolitics is that since politics is a public activity, one cannot be\npart of it without in some sense being present in a public space. To\nbe engaged in politics means actively participating in the various\npublic forums where the decisions affecting one\u2019s community are\ntaken. Arendt\u2019s insistence on the importance of direct participation\nin politics is thus based on the idea that, since politics is\nsomething that needs a worldly location and can only happen in a\npublic space, then if one is not present in such a space one is simply\nnot engaged in politics.\n\n\nThis public or world-centered conception of politics lies also at the\nbasis of the third feature stressed by Arendt, the distinction between\npublic and private interests. According to Arendt,\npolitical activity is not a means to an end, but an end in itself; one\ndoes not engage in political action to promote one\u2019s welfare, but to\nrealize the principles intrinsic to political life, such as freedom,\nequality, justice, and solidarity. In a late essay entitled\n\u201cPublic Rights and Private Interests\u201d (PRPI) Arendt\ndiscusses the difference between one\u2019s life as an individual and one\u2019s\nlife as a citizen, between the life spent on one\u2019s own and the life\nspent in common with others. She argues that our public interest as\ncitizens is quite distinct from our private interest as\nindividuals. The public interest is not the sum of private interests,\nnor their highest common denominator, nor even the total of\nenlightened self-interests. In fact, it has little to do with our\nprivate interests, since it concerns the world that lies beyond the\nself, that was there before our birth and that will be there after our\ndeath, a world that finds embodiment in activities and institutions\nwith their own intrinsic purposes which might often be at odds with\nour short-term and private interests. The public interest refers,\ntherefore, to the interests of a public world which we share as\ncitizens and which we can pursue and enjoy only by going beyond our\nprivate self-interest.\n",
