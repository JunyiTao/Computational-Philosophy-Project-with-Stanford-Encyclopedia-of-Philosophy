    "main_text": "Categories of Rights || Social and Welfare Rights\n3.2 Social and Welfare Rights\n\nIn an influential essay first published in 1950, the British\nsociologist T.H. Marshall posited \u201can evolution of citizenship which\nhas been in continuous progress for some 250 years\u201d (Marshall and\nBottomore 1987: 7). Marshall employed a tripartite distinction that\nwas, in some ways, similar to the traditional distinction found in the\nopinions of the U.S. Supreme Court, but his purpose was very different\nfrom any effort to hierarchically sort citizens into different\ncategories with differing sets of rights. He assumed that the rights\nof citizenship should be the same for all, and his aim was to show\nthat the set of rights had been expanding over the centuries.\n\nMarshall distinguished civil, political, and social rights, and he\nargued that, over the course of several centuries, the idea of\ncitizenship had progressively expanded from encompassing only civil\nrights to including political rights and then, during the\n20th century, to incorporating social rights. His\ndistinction between civil and political rights tracked the line that\nthe U.S. Supreme Court had drawn during the 19th century\nbetween rights to property, contract, due process etc., on the one\nside, and the rights to vote and hold office, on the other. But what\nhe meant by the term \u2019social rights\u2019 was very different\nfrom what the U.S. Supreme Court had in mind.\n\nMarshall explained that \u2019social rights\u2019 referred to \u201cthe\nwhole range [of rights] from the right to a modicum of economic\nwelfare and security to the right to share to the full in the social\nheritage and to live the life of a civilized being according to the\nstandards prevailing in the society\u201d (8). Included were rights to \u201ca\nminimum supply of certain essential goods and services (such as\nmedical attention and supplies, shelter and education) or a minimum\nmoney income available to be spent on essentials\u201d (32).\nMarshall\u2019s social rights were thus radically different from the\nrights that the Supreme Court had invoked in the Civil Rights\nCases: the court\u2019s rights were the rights of persons to\nassociate with others who wanted to associate with them and to exclude\nfrom their circle anyone whom they pleased, while Marshall\u2019s\nwere rights to a share of basic social goods access to which he\nthought was essential to individual well-being, or welfare.\nAccordingly, Marshall was suggesting that what came to be called\n\u201cwelfare rights\u201d were among the rights of free and equal citizens and\nthus were \u201ccivil rights\u201d in the broad sense. \n\nIn many wealthy countries today, but not in the U.S., welfare rights\nare protected as a matter of constitutional principle. For example,\nSection 75 of the Danish Constitution provides that \u201cany person unable\nto support himself or his dependents shall, where no other person is\nresponsible for his or their maintenance, be entitled to receive\npublic assistance.\u201d And the German Federal Constitutional Court has\nfound that the country\u2019s Basic Law establishes a \u201cSozialstaat\u201d\n(reflecting Marshall\u2019s use of \u2019social\u2019) and secures\nfor every member of society an enforceable right to be provided by\ngovernment the \u201cmaterial prerequisites which are indispensable\nfor his or her physical existence and for a minimum of participation\nin social, cultural and political life\u201d (Egidy 2011: 1964).\n",
