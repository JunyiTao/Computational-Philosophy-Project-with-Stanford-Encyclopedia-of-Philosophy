    "main_text": "Introduction: History and Measures of Implicit Social Cognition || Implicit Measures\n1.2 Implicit Measures\n\n\nWhat a person says is not necessarily a good representation of the\nwhole of what she feels and thinks, nor of how she will behave.\nArguably, the central advance of research on implicit social cognition\nis the ability to assess people\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and\nbehavior without having to ask them directly, \u201cwhat do you\nthink/feel about X?\u201d or \u201cwhat would you do in X\nsituation?\u201d \n\n\nImplicit measures, then, might be thought of as instruments that\nassess people\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and behavior indirectly, that\nis, without relying on \u201cself-report.\u201d This is too quick,\nhowever. For example, a survey that asks \u201cwhat do you think of\nblack people\u201d is explicit and direct, in the sense that the\nsubject\u2019s judgment is both explicitly reported and the subject is\nbeing directly asked about the topic of interest to the researchers.\nHowever, a survey that asks \u201cwhat do you think about\nDarnell\u201d (i.e., a person with a stereotypically black name) is\nexplicit and indirect, because the subject\u2019s judgment is\nexplicitly reported but the content of what is being judged (i.e., the\nsubject\u2019s attitudes toward race) is inferred by the researcher.\nThe distinction between direct and indirect measures is also relative\nrather than absolute. Even in some direct measures, such as personality\ninventories, subjects may not be completely aware of what is being\nstudied.\n\n\nIn the literature, \u201cimplicit\u201d is used to refer to at\nleast four distinct things (Gawronski & Brannon 2017): (1) a\ndistinctive psychological construct, such as an \u201cimplicit\nattitude,\u201d which is assessed by a variety of instruments; (2) a\nfamily of instruments, called \u201cimplicit measures,\u201d that\nassess people\u2019s thoughts and feelings in a specific way (e.g., in\na way that minimizes subjects\u2019 reliance on introspection and\ntheir ability to respond strategically); (3) a set of cognitive and\naffective processes\u2014\u201cimplicit processes\u201d\u2014that\naffect responses on a variety of measures; and (4) a kind of evaluative\nbehavior\u2014e.g., a categorization judgment\u2014elicited by\nspecific circumstances, such as cognitive load. In this entry, I\nwill use \u201cimplicit\u201d in the senses of (2) and (4), unless\notherwise noted. One virtue of this approach is that it allows one to\nremain agnostic about the nature of the phenomena implicit\nmeasures\n assess.[4]\nConsider Frank again.\nHis implicit gender bias may be assessed by several different\ninstruments, such as sequential priming or the \u201cImplicit\nAssociation Test\u201d (IAT; Greenwald et al. 1998). The IAT\u2014the\nmost well-known implicit test\u2014is a reaction time measure. In a\nstandard IAT, the subject attempts to sort words or pictures into\ncategories as fast as possible while making as few errors as possible.\nIn the images below, the correct answers would be left, right, left,\nright.\n\n\nImage 1\n\n\n\nImage 2\n\n\n\nImage 3\n\n\n\nImage 4\nAll images are copyright of \nProject Implicit\nand reproduced here with permission.\n\n\n\nAn IAT score is computed by comparing speed and error rates on the\n\u201cblocks\u201d (or trials) in which the pairing of concepts is\nconsistent with common stereotypes (images 1 and 3) to the blocks in\nwhich the pairing of the concepts is inconsistent with common\nstereotypes (images 2 and 4). If he is typical of most subjects, Frank\nwill be faster and make fewer errors on stereotype-consistent trials\nthan stereotype-inconsistent trials. While this\n\u201cgender-career\u201d IAT pairs concepts (e.g.,\n\u201cmale\u201d and \u201ccareer\u201d), other IATs, such as the\n\u201crace-evaluation\u201d IAT, pair a concept to an evaluation\n(e.g., \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d). Other IATs assess\nbody image, age, sexual orientation, and so on. As of 2019,\napproximately 26 million IATs have been taken (although it is unclear\nif this number represents 26 million unique participants or 26 million\ntests taken or started; Lai p.c.). One review (Nosek et al. 2007),\nwhich tested over 700,000 subjects on the race-evaluation IAT, found\nthat over 70% of white participants more easily associated black faces\nwith negative words (e.g., war, bad) and white faces with positive\nwords (e.g., peace, good). The researchers consider this an implicit\npreference for white faces over black\n faces.[5]\n\n\nAlthough the IAT remains the most popular implicit measure, it is\nfar from the only one. Other prominent implicit measures, many of which\nare derivations of sequential priming, are semantic priming (Banaji\n& Hardin 1996) and the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Payne\net al. 2005). Also, a \u201csecond generation\u201d of\ncategorization-based measures (like the IAT) has been developed. For\nexample, the Go/No-go Association Task (GNAT; Nosek & Banaji 2001)\npresents subjects with one target object rather than two in order to\ndetermine whether preferences or aversions are primarily responsible\nfor scores on the standard IAT (i.e., the ease of pairing good words\nwith white faces and bad words with black faces, or the difficulty of\npairing good words with black faces and bad words with white faces;\nBrewer 1999).\n\n\nA notable advance in the psychometrics of implicit bias has been the\nadvent of multinomial (or formal process) models, which identify\ndistinct processes contributing to performance on implicit measures.\nFor example, elderly people tend to show greater bias on the\nrace-evaluation IAT compared with younger people, but this may be due\nto their having stronger preferences for whites or having weaker\ncontrol over their biased responding (Nosek et al. 2011). Multinomial\nmodels, like the Quadruple Process Model (Conrey et al. 2005), are used\nto tease apart these possibilities. The Quad model identifies four\ndistinct processes that contribute to responses: (1) the automatic\nactivation of an association; (2) the subject\u2019s ability to\ndetermine a correct response (i.e., a response that reflects\none\u2019s subjective assessment of truth); (3) the ability to\noverride automatic associations; and (4) general response biases (e.g.,\nfavoring right-handed responses). Multinomial modeling has made\nclear that implicit measures are not \u201cprocess pure,\u201d i.e.,\nthey do not tap into a single unified psychological process.\n\n\nWhile there is not consensus about what implicit measures capture\n(\u00a72), it is clear that they provide at least three kinds of\ninformation (Gawronski & Hahn 2019). The first is information about\ndissociation with more explicit, direct measures. Correlations between\nimplicit and explicit measures tend to be relatively low (r =\n.2\u2013.25; Hofmann et al. 2005; Cameron et al. 2012), although these\nrelations are significantly affected by methodological practices, such\nas comparing non-corresponding implicit and explicit measures (e.g., an\nimplicit measure of gender stereotypes and an explicit \u201cfeelings\nthermometer\u201d toward women). It is important to note the breadth\nof research in this vein; dissociations between implicit and explicit\nmeasures are found in the study of personality (e.g., Vianello et al.\n2010), attitudes toward alcohol (e.g., de Houwer et al. 2004), phobias\n(Teachman & Woody 2003), and more. Second, implicit measures can be\nused as dependent variables in experiments. Theories about the\nformation and change of attitudes, for example, have focused on\ndifferential effects of manipulations, such as counter-attitudinal\ninformation, on implicit and explicit measures (e.g., Gawronski &\nBodenhausen 2006; Petty 2006). Third, implicit measures are used to\npredict behavior. Philosophers have been especially interested in the\nrelationship between implicit bias and discriminatory behavior,\nparticularly when the discriminatory behavior conflicts with a\nperson\u2019s reported beliefs (as in the \u201cFrank\u201d case\nabove). Studies report relationships between implicit bias and behavior\nin a huge variety of social contexts, from hiring to policing to\nmedicine to teaching and more (for an incomplete list see Table 1 in\nJost et al. 2009). There is also voluminous, varied, and on-going\ndiscussion about how well implicit measures predict behavior, along\nwith several related critical assessments of the information implicit\nmeasures provide (\u00a75).\n",
