It has been argued that this is what scientists\ndisplay in papers and textbooks when they present a model (Achinstein\n1968; Black 1962). This view has not been subject to explicit\ncriticism. However, some of the criticisms that have been marshaled\nagainst the so-called syntactic view of theories equally threaten a\nlinguistic understanding of models (for a discussion of this view, see the\nentry on\n the structure of scientific theories).\n First, a standard criticism of the syntactic view is that by\nassociating a theory with a particular formulation, the view\nmisconstrues theory identity because any change in the formulation\nresults in a new theory (Suppe 2000). A view that associates models\nwith descriptions would seem to be open to the same criticism. Second,\nmodels have different properties than descriptions: the Newtonian\nmodel of the solar system consists of orbiting spheres, but it makes\nno sense to say this about its description. Conversely, descriptions\nhave properties that models do not have: a description can be written\nin English and consist of 517 words, but the same cannot be said of a\nmodel. One way around these difficulties is to associate the model\nwith the content of a description rather than with the description\nitself. For a discussion of a position on models that builds on the\ncontent of a description, see Salis (forthcoming).\n\nA contemporary version of descriptivism is Levy\u2019s (2012, 2015)\nand Toon\u2019s (2012) so-called direct-representation view. This\nview shares with the fiction view of models\n (Section 2.2)\n the reliance on Walton\u2019s pretense theory, but uses it in a\ndifferent way. The main difference is that the views discussed earlier\nsee modeling as introducing a vehicle of representation, the model,\nthat is distinct from the target, and they see the problem as\nelucidating what kind of thing the model is. On the\ndirect-representation view there are no models distinct from the\ntarget; there are only model-descriptions and targets, with no models\nin-between them. Modeling, on this view, consists in providing an\nimaginative description of real things. A model-description prescribes\nimaginings about the real system; the ideal pendulum, for instance,\nprescribes model-users to imagine the real spring as perfectly elastic\nand the bob as a point mass. This approach avoids the above problems\nbecause the identity conditions for models are given by the conditions\nfor games of make-believe (and not by the syntax of a description) and\nproperty ascriptions take place in pretense. There are, however,\nquestions about how this account deals with models that have no target\n(like models of the ether or four-sex populations), and about how\nmodels thus understood deal with idealizations. For a discussion of\nthese points, see Frigg and Nguyen (2016), Poznic (2016), and Salis\n(forthcoming).\n\nA closely related approach sees models as equations. This is a version\nof the view that models are descriptions, because equations are\nsyntactic items that describe a mathematical structure. The issues\nthat this view faces are similar to the ones we have already\nencountered: First, one can describe the same situation using\ndifferent kinds of coordinates and as a result obtain different\nequations but without thereby also obtaining a different model.\nSecond, the model and the equation have different properties. A\npendulum contains a massless string, but the equation describing its\nmotion does not; and an equation may be inhomogeneous, but the system\nit describes is not. It is an open question whether these issues can\nbe avoided by appeal to a pretense account.\n",
