    "main_text": "Theory of Abstraction\n11. Theory of Abstraction\n\n\nAccording to Godfrey the agent intellect and the possible intellect\nare distinct powers of the individual human soul. His theory of\nintellectual knowledge is based on the agent intellect\u2019s ability to\nabstract potentially intelligible content from phantasms (images)\nproduced by the imagination, an internal sense. The imagination depends\nupon the external senses for the data preserved in the phantasms. In\nQuodlibet V, q. 10 he makes a studied effort to explain in what the\nprocess of abstraction from phantasms consists as he responds to the\nquestion whether the agent intellect produces any positive disposition\nin the phantasm. One of the functions of the agent intellect is to\nilluminate phantasms so that they can move the possible intellect to\nunderstand. Because the possible intellect is at times only in potency\nwith respect to an intelligible object, and because nothing can reduce\nitself from potency to act, it must be reduced to the act of\nunderstanding by something else. Hence the agent intellect must in some\nway enable phantasms to move or to actualize the possible\nintellect.\n\n\nBut, argues Godfrey, because phantasms exist in the imagination and\nare organic and individuated and therefore incapable of moving a\npurely spiritual power which knows in universal fashion, the agent\nintellect does not introduce any positive disposition into the\nphantasms. Such a disposition would itself be individuated and organic\nand incapable of moving the possible intellect. He concludes,\ntherefore, that the agent intellect operates on the phantasm simply by\nremoving or separating or isolating one factor present\ntherein\u2014the quiddity of the thing, from another\u2014its\nindividuating characteristics. What has been so removed or separated\nor abstracted is thereby rendered universal and capable of moving the\npossible intellect. In what would become a frequently cited\nillustration, he draws an analogy with milk which possesses both color\n(white) and taste (sweet). Without the influence of light, however, it\ncould not manifest itself or be perceived under the species of color\n(as white) without also manifesting itself under the species of taste\n(as sweet). Because of the influence of light one can speak of a kind\nof \u201cabstraction\u201d of the white from the sweet, although not in the\nsense that one would then exist apart from the other.\n So, too, in the order of consideration although not in the order\nof reality, the agent intellect separates or frees the quiddity\npresented in a phantasm from its individuating conditions and thereby\nreduces it from being potentially intelligible to being actually\nintelligible and capable of moving the possible intellect to\nunderstand. This freeing or abstracting process takes place because of\na kind of spiritual contact with the light of the agent intellect\n(Wippel, 1986). And, according to Godfrey the abstracted quiddity or\nintelligible object is really the efficient cause of the possible\nintellect\u2019s actual cognition of that object, just as the object of a\nsense power is the efficient cause of that sense power\u2019s actual\nperception of its object. In both cases this is again because nothing\ncan reduce itself from potency to act (Quodlibet VIII, q. 2, PB\n4.30\u201333; Quodlibet IX, q.19, PB 4.276\u201378; Quodlibet XIII,\nq. 3, PB 5.191\u201394, 200\u2013202; Wippel, 1981,194\u2013200;\nC\u00f4t\u00e9, 2007, especially on Quodlibet XII, q. 1; Hartman, 2014).\n",
