    "main_text": "\n\n\nThomas Samuel Kuhn (1922\u20131996) is one of the most influential\nphilosophers of science of the twentieth century, perhaps the most\ninfluential. His 1962 book The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions is one of the most cited academic books of all\ntime. Kuhn\u2019s contribution to the philosophy of science marked not only\na break with several key positivist doctrines, but also inaugurated a\nnew style of philosophy of science that brought it closer to the\nhistory of science. His account of the development of science held\nthat science enjoys periods of stable growth punctuated by revisionary\nrevolutions. To this thesis, Kuhn added the controversial\n\u2018incommensurability thesis\u2019, that theories from differing\nperiods suffer from certain deep kinds of failure of\ncomparability.\n",
