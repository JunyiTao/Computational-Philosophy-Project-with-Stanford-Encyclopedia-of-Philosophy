    "main_text": "\n\nHenry Sidgwick was one of the most influential ethical philosophers of\nthe Victorian era, and his work continues to exert a powerful\ninfluence on Anglo-American ethical and political theory, with an\nincreasing global impact as well. His masterpiece, The Methods of\nEthics was first published in 1874 (seventh edition: 1907) and in\nmany ways marked the culmination of the classical utilitarian\ntradition\u2014the tradition of Jeremy Bentham and James and John\nStuart Mill\u2014with its emphasis on \u201cthe greatest happiness\nof the greatest number\u201d as the fundamental normative demand.\nSidgwick\u2019s treatment of that position was more comprehensive and\nscholarly than any previous one, and he set the agenda for most of the\ntwentieth-century debates between utilitarians and their critics.\nUtilitarians and consequentialists from G. E. Moore and Bertrand\nRussell to J. J. C. Smart and R. M. Hare down to Derek Parfit, Peter\nSinger, and Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek have acknowledged\nSidgwick\u2019s Methods as a vital source for their\narguments. But in addition to authoritatively formulating\nutilitarianism and inspiring utilitarians and their sympathizers, the\nMethods has also served as a general model for how to do\nethical theory, since it provides a series of systematic, historically\ninformed comparisons between utilitarianism and its leading\nalternatives.\n\nEven such influential critics of utilitarianism as William Frankena,\nMarcus Singer, and John Rawls looked to Sidgwick\u2019s work for\nguidance. C. D. Broad, a later successor to Sidgwick\u2019s Cambridge\nchair, famously went so far as to say \n\n\nSidgwick\u2019s Methods of Ethics seems to me to be on the\nwhole the best treatise on moral theory that has ever been written,\nand to be one of the English philosophical classics. (Broad 1930: 143)\n\n\n\nIn recent years, Broad\u2019s assessment has been endorsed by an\nincreasing number of prominent philosophers (Parfit 2011\u20132017;\nde Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014, 2021; Crisp 2015; Phillips 2022).\nEngaging with Sidgwick\u2019s work remains an excellent way to\ncultivate a serious philosophical interest in ethics, metaethics, and\npractical ethics, not to mention the history of these subjects.\nMoreover, he made important contributions to many other fields,\nincluding economics, political theory, classics, educational theory,\nand parapsychology. His significance as an intellectual and cultural\nfigure has yet to be fully appreciated, but recent years have\nwitnessed an impressive expansion of Sidgwick studies, and he has even\nbeen featured in popular novels (Cohen 2010; Entwistle 2014). What is\nstill relatively rare is serious engagement with Sidgwick\u2019s role\nin advancing liberal imperialism and the ideology of the British\nEmpire (Schultz 2004; Bell 2016). \n",
