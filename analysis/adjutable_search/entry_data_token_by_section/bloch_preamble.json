    "main_text": "\n\nErnst Bloch (1885\u20131977) was a German philosopher and cultural\ncritic who is mostly credited for renewing the interest in utopia and\nfor mediating between the radical philosophy of emancipation,\nnon-dogmatic religious thought, analysis of mass culture, and new\naesthetic forms, notably those of Expressionism. His books, especially\nThe Principle of Hope (1954\u20131959), contributed to a\nparticular form of critical theory and, being written in a peculiar\nessayistic style, made him quite popular both in academic and\nnon-academic circles. Bloch was an important voice among the\nintelligentsia of Weimar Germany and then, for a short period\nafter the Second World war, the leading philosopher of the Eastern\nGermany. However, he quickly became a \u201cdeviator\u201d for the\nMarxist ideologists. Beyond the Eastern bloc, he made a profound\nimpact on utopian studies, theology, and aesthetics of the previous\ncentury, but also, generally, on political philosophy and critical\ntheory. Bloch\u2019s leftist orientation and the optimistic account\nof hope made him a critic of existentialist thought, despite many\ngenealogical and stylistic affinities to it. Basing on Hegel and Marx,\nbut also drawing on many other intellectual traditions, Bloch sought\nto formulate the ontology and political philosophy for uncertain and\nopen-ended world. This was reflected in his \u201cutopian\nhermeneutics\u201d seeking to uncover the unfinishedness, the\n\u201cnot yet\u201d in any phenomenon of nature or culture; in his\nsensitivity to the immediacy of human existence (inspired, in part, by\nthe phenomenological movement) and to the various forms of mass\nculture; and in his attempts to reformulate Marxism as an utopian\nproject of humanization of nature/naturalization of humans. The\nexperience of utopian non-identity is elevated to the level of the\nontological principle: \u201cS is not yet P\u201d, and\nthe human quest for emancipation is grounded in the unfulfilled state\nof being itself.\n",
