    "main_text": "A popular form of the argument: Bohr\u2019s response\n2. A popular form of the argument: Bohr\u2019s response\n\nThe literature surrounding EPR contains yet another version of the\nargument, a popular version that\u2014unlike any of\nEinstein\u2019s\u2014features the\n Criterion of Reality.\n Assume again an interaction between our two systems linking their\npositions and their linear momenta and suppose that the systems are\nfar apart. If we measure the position of Albert\u2019s system, we can infer\nthat Niels\u2019 system has a corresponding position. We can also predict\nit with certainty, given the result of the position measurement of\nAlbert\u2019s system. Hence, in this version, the Criterion of Reality is\ntaken to imply that the position of Niels\u2019 system constitutes an\nelement of reality. Similarly, if we measure the momentum of Albert\u2019s\nsystem, we can conclude that the momentum of Niels\u2019 system is an\nelement of reality. The argument now concludes that since we can\nchoose freely to measure either position or momentum, it\n\u201cfollows\u201d that both must be elements of reality\nsimultaneously.\n\nOf course no such conclusion follows from our freedom of choice. It is\nnot sufficient to be able to choose at will which quantity to measure;\nfor the conclusion to follow from the Criterion alone one would need\nto be able to measure both quantities at once. This is precisely the\npoint that Einstein recognized in his\n 1932 letter to Ehrenfest\n and that EPR addresses by assuming locality and separability. What is\nstriking about this version is that these principles, central to the\noriginal EPR argument and to the dilemma at the heart of Einstein\u2019s\nversions, are obscured here. Instead this version features the\nCriterion and those \u201celements of reality\u201d. Perhaps the\ndifficulties presented by Podolsky\u2019s text contribute to this reading.\nIn any case, in the physics literature this version is commonly taken\nto represent EPR and usually attributed to Einstein. This reading\ncertainly has a prominent source in terms of which one can understand\nits popularity among physicists; it is Niels Bohr himself.\n\nBy the time of the EPR paper many of the early interpretive battles\nover the quantum theory had been settled, at least to the satisfaction\nof working physicists. Bohr had emerged as the\n\u201cphilosopher\u201d of the new theory and the community of\nquantum theorists, busy with the development and extension of the\ntheory, were content to follow Bohr\u2019s leadership when it came to\nexplaining and defending its conceptual underpinnings (Beller 1999,\nChapter 13). Thus in 1935 the burden fell to Bohr to explain what was\nwrong with the EPR \u201cparadox\u201d. The major article that he\nwrote in discharging this burden (Bohr 1935a) became the canon for how\nto respond to EPR. Unfortunately, Bohr\u2019s summary of EPR in that\narticle, which is the version just above, also became the canon for\nwhat EPR contained by way of argument.\n\nBohr\u2019s response to EPR begins, as do many of his treatments of the\nconceptual issues raised by the quantum theory, with a discussion of\nlimitations on the simultaneous determination of position and\nmomentum. As usual, these are drawn from an analysis of the\npossibilities of measurement if one uses an apparatus consisting of a\ndiaphragm connected to a rigid frame. Bohr emphasizes that the\nquestion is to what extent can we trace the interaction between the\nparticle being measured and the measuring instrument. (See Beller\n1999, Chapter 7 for a detailed analysis and discussion of the\n\u201ctwo voices\u201d contained in Bohr\u2019s account. See too\nBacciagaluppi 2015.) Following the summary of EPR, Bohr (1935a, p.\n700) then focuses on the Criterion of Reality which, he says,\n\u201ccontains an ambiguity as regards the meaning of the expression\n\u2018without in any way disturbing a system\u2019.\u201d Bohr\nagrees that in the indirect measurement of Niels\u2019 system achieved when\none makes a measurement of Albert\u2019s system \u201cthere is no question\nof a mechanical disturbance\u201d of Niels\u2019 system. Still, Bohr\nclaims that a measurement on Albert\u2019s system does involve \u201can\ninfluence on the very conditions which define the possible types of\npredictions regarding the future behavior of [Niels\u2019] system.\u201d\nThe meaning of this claim is not at all clear. Indeed, in revisiting\nEPR fifteen years later, Bohr would comment, \n\nRereading these passages, I am deeply aware of the inefficiency of\nexpression which must have made it very difficult to appreciate the\ntrend of the argumentation (Bohr 1949, p. 234).\n\n\nUnfortunately, Bohr takes no notice there of Einstein\u2019s later versions\nof the argument and merely repeats his earlier response to EPR. In\nthat response, however inefficiently, Bohr appears to be directing\nattention to the fact that when we measure, for example, the position\nof Albert\u2019s system conditions are in place for predicting the position\nof Niels\u2019 system but not its momentum. The opposite would be true in\nmeasuring the momentum of Albert\u2019s system. Thus his \u201cpossible\ntypes of predictions\u201d concerning Niels\u2019 system appear to\ncorrespond to which variable we measure on Albert\u2019s system. Bohr\nproposes then to block the EPR Criterion by counting, say, the\nposition measurement of Albert\u2019s system as an \u201cinfluence\u201d\non the distant system of Niels. If we assume it is an influence that\ndisturbs Niels\u2019 system, then the Criterion could not be used, as in\nBohr\u2019s version of the argument, in producing an element of reality for\nNiels\u2019 system that challenges completeness.\n\nThere are two important things to notice about this response. The\nfirst is this. In conceding that Einstein\u2019s indirect method for\ndetermining, say, the position of Niels\u2019 system does not mechanically\ndisturb that system, Bohr departs from his original program of\ncomplementarity, which was to base the uncertainty relations and the\nstatistical character of quantum theory on uncontrollable physical\ninteractions, interactions that were supposed to arise inevitably\nbetween a measuring instrument and the system being measured. Instead\nBohr now distinguishes between a genuine physical interaction (his\n\u201cmechanical disturbance\u201d) and some other sort of\n\u201cinfluence\u201d on the conditions for specifying (or\n\u201cdefining\u201d) sorts of predictions for the future behavior\nof a system. In emphasizing that there is no question of a robust\ninteraction in the EPR situation, Bohr retreats from his earlier,\nphysically grounded conception of complementarity.\n\nThe second important thing to notice is how Bohr\u2019s response needs to\nbe implemented in order to block the argument of EPR and Einstein\u2019s\nlater arguments that pose a dilemma between principles of locality and\ncompleteness. In these arguments the locality principle makes explicit\nreference to the reality of the unmeasured system: the reality\npertaining to Niels\u2019 system does not depend on what measurements (if\nany) are made locally on Albert\u2019s system. Hence Bohr\u2019s suggestion that\nthose measurements influence conditions for specifying types of\npredictions would not affect the argument unless one includes those\nconditions as part of the reality of Niels\u2019 system. This is exactly\nwhat Bohr goes on to say, \u201cthese conditions constitute an\ninherent element of the description of any phenomena to which the term\n\u2018physical reality\u2019 can be properly attached\u201d (Bohr\n1935a, p. 700). So Bohr\u2019s picture is that these\n\u201cinfluences\u201d, operating directly across any spatial\ndistances, result in different physically real states of Niels\u2019 system\ndepending on the type of measurement made on Albert\u2019s. (Recall EPR\nwarning against just this move.) \n\nThe quantum formalism for interacting systems describes how a\nmeasurement on Albert\u2019s system reduces the composite state and\ndistributes quantum states and associated probabilities to the\ncomponent systems. Here Bohr redescribes that formal reduction using\nEPR\u2019s language of influences and reality. He turns ordinary local\nmeasurements into \u201cinfluences\u201d that automatically change\nphysical reality elsewhere, and at any distance whatsoever. This\ngrounds the quantum formalism in a rather magical ontological\nframework, a move quite out of character for the usually pragmatic\nBohr. In his correspondence over EPR, Schr\u00f6dinger compared ideas\nlike that to ritual magic. \n\nThis assumption arises from the standpoint of the savage, who believes\nthat he can harm his enemy by piercing the enemy\u2019s image with a\nneedle. (Letter to Edward Teller, June 14, 1935, quoted in\nBacciagaluppi 2015)\n\n\nIt is as though EPR\u2019s talk of \u201creality\u201d and its elements\nprovoked Bohr to adopt the position of Moliere\u2019s doctor who, pressed\nto explain why opium is a sedative, invents an inherent dormative\nvirtue, \u201cwhich causes the senses to become drowsy.\u201d\nUsually Bohr sharply deflates any attempt like this to get behind the\nformalism, insisting that \u201cthe appropriate physical\ninterpretation of the symbolic quantum-mechanical formalism amounts\nonly to predictions, of determinate or statistical character\u201d\n(Bohr 1949, p. 238).\n\nCould this portrait of nonlocal influences automatically shaping a\ndistant reality be a by-product of Bohr\u2019s \u201cinefficiency of\nexpression\u201d? Despite Bohr\u2019s seeming tolerance for a breakdown of\nlocality in his response here to EPR, in other places Bohr rejects\nnonlocality in the strongest terms. For example in discussing an\nelectron double slit experiment, which is Bohr\u2019s favorite model for\nillustrating the novel conceptual features of quantum theory, and\nwriting only weeks before the publication of EPR, Bohr argues as\nfollows.\n\nIf we only imagine the possibility that without disturbing the\nphenomena we determine through which hole the electron passes, we\nwould truly find ourselves in irrational territory, for this would put\nus in a situation in which an electron, which might be said to pass\nthrough this hole, would be affected by the circumstance of whether\nthis [other] hole was open or closed; but \u2026 it is completely\nincomprehensible that in its later course [the electron] should let\nitself be influenced by this hole down there being open or shut. (Bohr\n1935b)\n\n\nIt is uncanny how closely Bohr\u2019s language mirrors that of EPR. But\nhere Bohr defends locality and regards the very contemplation of\nnonlocality as \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201ccompletely\nincomprehensible\u201d. Since \u201cthe circumstance of whether this\n[other] hole was open or closed\u201d does affect the possible types\nof predictions regarding the electron\u2019s future behavior, if we expand\nthe concept of the electron\u2019s \u201creality\u201d, as he appears to\nsuggest for EPR, by including such information, we do\n\u201cdisturb\u201d the electron around one hole by opening or\nclosing the other hole. That is, if we give to \u201cdisturb\u201d\nand to \u201creality\u201d the very same sense that Bohr appears to\ngive them when responding to EPR, then we are led to an\n\u201cincomprehensible\u201d nonlocality, and into the territory of\nthe irrational (like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s savage).\n\nThere is another way of trying to understand Bohr\u2019s position.\nAccording to one common reading (see\n Copenhagen Interpretation),\n after EPR Bohr embraced a relational (or contextual) account of\nproperty attribution. On this account to speak of the position, say,\nof a system presupposes that one already has put in place an\nappropriate interaction involving an apparatus for measuring position\n(or at least an appropriate frame of reference for the measurement;\nDickson 2004). Thus \u201cthe position\u201d of the system refers to\na relation between the system and the measuring device (or measurement\nframe). (See\n Relational Quantum Mechanics,\n where a similar idea is developed independently of measurements.) In\nthe EPR context this would seem to imply that before one is set up to\nmeasure the position of Albert\u2019s system, talk of the position of\nNiels\u2019 system is out of place; whereas after one measures the position\nof Albert\u2019s system, talk of the position of Niels\u2019 system is\nappropriate and, indeed, we can then say truly that Niels\u2019 system\n\u201chas\u201d a position. Similar considerations govern momentum\nmeasurements. It follows, then, that local manipulations carried out\non Albert\u2019s system, in a place we may assume to be far removed from\nNiels\u2019 system, can directly affect what is meaningful to say about, as\nwell as factually true of, Niels\u2019 system. Similarly, in the double\nslit arrangement, it would follow that what can be said meaningfully\nand said truly about the position of the electron around the top hole\nwould depend on the context of whether the bottom hole is open or\nshut. One might suggest that such relational actions-at-a-distance are\nharmless ones, perhaps merely \u201csemantic\u201d; like becoming\nthe \u201cbest\u201d at a task when your only competitor\u2014who\nmight be miles away\u2014fails. Note, however, that in the case of\nordinary relational predicates it is not inappropriate (or\n\u201cmeaningless\u201d) to talk about the situation in the absence\nof complete information about the relata. So you might be the best at\na task even if your competitor has not yet tried it, and you are\ndefinitely not an aunt (or uncle) until one of your siblings gives\nbirth. But should we say that an electron is nowhere at all until we\nare set up to measure its position, or would it be inappropriate\n(meaningless?) even to ask? \n\nIf quantum predicates are relational, they are different from many\nordinary relations in that the conditions for the relata are taken as\ncriterial for the application of the term. In this regard one might\ncontrast the relativity of simultaneity with the proposed relativity\nof position. In relativistic physics specifying a world-line fixes a\nframe of reference for attributions of simultaneity to events\nregardless of whether any temporal measurements are being made or\ncontemplated. But in the quantum case, on this proposal, specifying a\nframe of reference for position (say, the laboratory frame) does not\nentitle one to attribute position to a system, unless that frame is\nassociated with actually preparing or completing a measurement of\nposition for that system. To be sure, analyzing predicates in terms of\noccurrent measurement or observation is familiar from neopositivist\napproaches to the language of science; for example, in Percy\nBridgman\u2019s operational analysis of physical terms, where the actual\napplications of test-response pairs constitute criteria for any\nmeaningful use of a term (see\n Theory and Observation in Science ).\n Rudolph Carnap\u2019s later introduction of reduction sentences (see the\nentry on the\n Vienna Circle)\n has a similar character. Still, this positivist reading entails just\nthe sort of nonlocality that Bohr seemed to abhor.\n\nIn the light of all this it is difficult to know whether a coherent\nresponse can be attributed to Bohr reliably that would derail EPR. (In\ndifferent ways, Dickson 2004 and Halvorson and Clifton 2004 make an\nattempt on Bohr\u2019s behalf. These are examined in Whitaker 2004 and Fine\n2007. See also the essays in Faye and Folse 2017.) Bohr may well have\nbeen aware of the difficulty in framing the appropriate concepts\nclearly when, a few years after EPR, he wrote,\n\nThe unaccustomed features of the situation with which we are\nconfronted in quantum theory necessitate the greatest caution as\nregard all questions of terminology. Speaking, as it is often done of\ndisturbing a phenomenon by observation, or even of creating physical\nattributes to objects by measuring processes is liable to be\nconfusing, since all such sentences imply a departure from conventions\nof basic language which even though it can be practical for the sake\nof brevity, can never be unambiguous.
