Views Opposing the Independence Dimension (I): Semantic Realism\n\nExamples of challenges to the existence dimension of realism have been\ndescribed in previous sections. In this section some forms of\nnon-realism that are neither error-theoretic nor expressivist will be\nbriefly introduced. The forms of non-realism view the sentences of the\nrelevant area as (against the expressivist) truth-apt, and (against\nthe error-theorist) at least sometimes true. The existence dimension\nof realism is thus left intact. What is challenged is the independence\ndimension of realism, the claim that the objects distinctive of the\narea exist, or that the properties distinctive of the area are\ninstantiated, independently of anyone\u2019s beliefs, linguistic\npractices, conceptual schemes, and so on.\n\nClassically, opposition to the independence dimension of realism about\nthe everyday world of macroscopic objects took the form of\nidealism, the view that the objects of the everyday world of\nmacroscopic objects are in some sense mental. As Berkeley\nfamously claimed, tables, chairs, cats, the moons of Jupiter and so\non, are nothing but ideas in the minds of spirits:\n\nAll the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth, in a word all\nthose bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world, have not any\nsubsistence without a mind (Berkeley 1710: \u00a76).\n\n\nIdealism has long been out of favour in contemporary philosophy\n(though see Goldschmidt & Pearce 2017 for some recent discussion),\nbut those who doubt the independence dimension of realism have sought\nmore sophisticated ways of opposing it. One such philosopher, Michael\nDummett, has suggested that in some cases it may be appropriate to\nreject the independence dimension of realism via the rejection of\nsemantic realism about the area in question (see Dummett 1978 and\n1993). This section contains a brief explanation of semantic realism,\nas characterised by Dummett, Dummett\u2019s views on the relationship\nbetween semantic realism and realism construed as a metaphysical\nthesis, and an outline of some of the arguments in the philosophy of\nlanguage that Dummett has suggested might be wielded against semantic\nrealism.\n\nIt is easiest to characterise semantic realism for a mathematical\ndomain. It is a feature of arithmetic that there are some arithmetical\nsentences for which the following holds true: we know of no method\nthat will guarantee us a proof of the sentence, and we know of no\nmethod that will guarantee us a disproof or a counterexample either.\nOne such is Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture:\n\n(G) Every even number is the sum of two primes. \n\nIt is possible that we may come across a proof, or a counterexample,\nbut the key point is that we do not know a method, or methods, the\napplication of which is guaranteed to yield one or the other. A\nsemantic realist, in Dummett\u2019s sense, is one who holds that our\nunderstanding of a sentence like (G) consists in knowledge of its\ntruth-condition, where the notion of truth involved is potentially\nrecognition-transcendent or bivalent. To say that the\nnotion of truth involved is potentially recognition-transcendent is to\nsay that (G) may be true (or false) even though there is no guarantee\nthat we will be able, in principle, to recognise that that is so. To\nsay that the notion of truth involved is bivalent is to accept the\nunrestricted applicability of the law of bivalence, that every\nmeaningful sentence is determinately either true or false. Thus the\nsemantic realist is prepared to assert that (G) is determinately\neither true or false, regardless of the fact that we have no\nguaranteed method of ascertaining which. (Note that the precise\nrelationship between the characterisation in terms of bivalence and\nthat in terms of potentially recognition-transcendent truth is a\ndelicate matter that will not concern us here. See the Introduction to\nWright 1993 for some excellent discussion. It is also important to\nnote that in introducing the idea that a speaker\u2019s understanding\nof a sentence consists in her knowledge of its truth-condition,\nDummett is packing more into the notion of truth than the\ndisquotational properties made use of in \u00a71 above. See\nDummett\u2019s essay \u2018Truth\u2019, in his 1978).\n\nDummett makes two main claims about semantic realism. First, there is\nwhat Devitt (1991a) has termed the metaphor thesis: This\ndenies that we can even have a literal, austerely\nmetaphysical characterisation of realism of the sort attempted above\nwith Generic Realism. Dummett writes, of the attempt to give an\naustere metaphysical characterisation of realism about mathematics\n(platonic realism) and what stands opposed to it (intuitionism):\n\nHow [are] we to decide this dispute over the ontological status of\nmathematical objects[?] As I have remarked, we have here two\nmetaphors: the platonist compares the mathematician with the\nastronomer, the geographer or the explorer, the intuitionist compares\nhim with the sculptor or the imaginative writer; and neither\ncomparison seems very apt. The disagreement evidently relates to the\namount of freedom that the mathematician has. Put this way, however,\nboth seem partly right and partly wrong: the mathematician has great\nfreedom in devising the concepts he introduces and in delineating the\nstructure he chooses to study, but he cannot prove just whatever he\ndecides it would be attractive to prove. How are we to make the\ndisagreement into a definite one, and how can we then resolve it?\n(1978: xxv).\n\n\nAccording to the constitution thesis, the literal content of\nrealism consists in the content of semantic realism. Thus,\nthe literal content of realism about the external world is constituted\nby the claim that our understanding of at least some sentences\nconcerning the external world consists in our grasp of their\npotentially recognition-transcendent truth-conditions. The spurious\n\u2018debate\u2019 in metaphysics between realism and non-realism\ncan thus become a genuine debate within the theory of\nmeaning: should we characterise speakers\u2019 understanding in terms\nof grasp of potentially recognition-transcendent truth-conditions? As\nDummett puts it:\n\nThe dispute [between realism and its opponents] concerns the notion of\ntruth appropriate for statements of the disputed class; and this means\nthat it is a dispute concerning the kind of meaning which\nthese statements have (1978: 146).\n\n\nFew have been convinced by either the metaphor thesis or the\nconstitution thesis. Consider Generic Realism in the case of the world\nof everyday macroscopic objects and properties:\n\n(GR1) Tables, rocks, mountains, seas, and so on exist, and the fact\nthat they exist and have properties such as mass, size, shape, colour,\nand so on, is (apart from mundane empirical dependencies of the sort\nsometimes encountered in everyday life) independent of anyone\u2019s\nbeliefs, linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, and so on. \n\nDummett may well call for some non-metaphorical characterisation of\nthe independence claim which this involves, but it is relatively easy\nto provide one such characterisation by utilising Dummett\u2019s own\nnotion of recognition-transcendence:\n\n(GR2) Tables, rocks, mountains, seas, and so on exist, and the fact\nthat they exist and have properties such as mass, size, shape,colour,\nand so on, is (apart from mundane empirical dependencies of the sort\nsometimes encountered in everyday life) independent of anyone\u2019s\nbeliefs, linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, and so on. Tables,\nrocks, mountains, seas, and so on exist, and in general there is no\nguarantee that we will be able, even in principle, to recognise the\nfact that they exist and have properties such as mass, size, shape,\ncolour, and so on.\n\nOn the face of it, there is nothing metaphorical in (GR2) or, at least\nif there is, some argument from Dummett to that effect is required.\nThis throws some doubt on the metaphor thesis. Moreover there is\nnothing distinctively semantic about (GR2), and this throws some doubt\non the constitution thesis. Whereas for Dummett, the essential realist\nthesis is the meaning-theoretic claim that our understanding of a\nsentence like (G) consists in knowledge of its potentially\nrecognition-transcendent truth-condition, for Devitt:\n\nWhat has truth to do with Realism? On the face of it, nothing at all.\nIndeed, Realism says nothing semantic at all beyond \u2026\nmaking the negative point that our semantic capacities do not\nconstitute the world. (1991a: 39)\n\n\nDevitt\u2019s main criticism of the constitution thesis is this: the\nliteral content of realism about the external world is not given by\nsemantic realism, since semantic realism is consistent with an\nidealist metaphysics of the external world. He writes:\n\nDoes [semantic realism] entail Realism? It does not. Realism \u2026\nrequires the objective independent existence of common-sense physical\nentities. Semantic Realism concerns physical statements and\nhas no such requirement: it says nothing about the nature of the\nreality that makes those statements true or false, except that it\nis [at least in part potentially beyond the reach of our best\ninvestigative efforts]. An idealist who believed in the \u2026\nexistence of a purely mental realm of sense-data could subscribe to\n[semantic realism]. He could believe that physical statements are true\nor false according as they do or do not correspond to the realm of\nsense-data, whatever anyone\u2019s opinion on the matter: we have no\n\u2018incorrigible knowledge\u2019 of sense-data. \u2026 In sum,\nmere talk of truth will not yield any particular ontology. (1983: 77)\n\n\nSuppose that Dummett\u2019s metaphor and constitution theses are both\nimplausible. Would it follow that the arguments Dummett develops\nagainst semantic realism have no relevance to debates about the\nplausibility of realism about everyday macroscopic objects (say),\nconstrued as a purely metaphysical thesis as in (GR2)? It can be\nargued that Dummett\u2019s arguments can retain their relevance to a\nmetaphysical debate even if the metaphor and constitution theses are\nfalse, and, indeed, even if Dummett\u2019s view (1973: 669) that the\ntheory of meaning is the foundation of all philosophy is rejected. For\na full development of this line of argument, see Miller 2003a and\n2006.\n\nDummett\u2019s main line of argument against semantic realism is the\nmanifestation argument. Here is the argument (See Dummett\n1978 and the summary in Miller 2018, chapter 9):\n\nSuppose that we are considering region of discourse D.\nThen:\n\nWe understand the sentences of D.\n\nSuppose, for reductio, that\n\nThe sentences of D have recognition-transcendent\ntruth-conditions.\n\nNow, given\n\nTo understand a sentence is to know its truth-conditions (Frege\n1892, cf. Miller 2018 chapters 1 and 2).\n\nWe can conclude\n\nWe know the (recognition-transcendent) truth-conditions of the\nsentences of D.\n\nWe then add the following premise, which stems from the\nWittgensteinian insight that understanding does not consist in the\npossession of an inner state, but rather in the possession of some\npractical ability (see Wittgenstein 1958):\n\nTo understand a sentence is to manifest the practical abilities\nthat constitute our understanding of that sentence\n\nFor example, in the case of a simple language consisting of\ndemonstratives and taste predicates (such as \u201cbitter\u201d and\n\u201csweet\u201d), applied to foodstuffs within reach of the\nspeaker, a speaker\u2019s understanding consists in his ability to\ndetermine whether \u201cthis is bitter\u201d is true, by putting the\nrelevant foodstuff in his mouth and tasting it (Wright 1993).\n\nIt now follows that:\n\nTo know the truth-conditions of a sentence is to manifest the\npractical abilities that constitute our understanding of that\nsentence.\n\nSo:\n\nOur knowledge of the (recognition-transcendent) truth-conditions\nof the sentences of D is manifested in our exercise of the\npractical abilities that constitute our understanding of the sentences\nof D. \n\nSince\n\nKnowledge of recognition-transcendent truth-conditions is never\nmanifested in the exercise of practical abilities\n\nIt follows that\n\nKnowledge of the (recognition-transcendent) truth-conditions of\nthe sentences of D is never manifested in the exercise of\npractical abilities.\n\nSo\n\nWe cannot exercise practical abilities that constitute our\nunderstanding of D.\n\nSo\n\n(11) We do not understand the sentences of D.\n\nThis yields a contradiction with (1), whence, by reductio, we\nreject (2) to obtain:\n\nThe sentences of D do not have recognition-transcendent\ntruth-conditions, so that semantic realism about the subject matter of\nD must be rejected. \n\nThe key claim here is (8). So far as an account of speakers\u2019\nunderstanding goes, the ascription of knowledge of\nrecognition-transcendent truth-conditions is simply\nredundant: there is no good reason for ascribing it. Consider\none of the sentences introduced earlier as a candidate for possessing\nrecognition-transcendent truth-conditions \u2018Every even number\ngreater than two is the sum of two primes\u2019. The semantic realist\nviews our understanding of sentences like this as consisting in our\nknowledge of a potentially recognition-transcendent truth-condition.\nBut:\n\nHow can that account be viewed as a description of any\npractical ability of use? No doubt someone who understands\nsuch a statement can be expected to have many relevant practical\nabilities. He will be able to appraise evidence for or against it,\nshould any be available, or to recognize that no information in his\npossession bears on it. He will be able to recognize at least some of\nits logical consequences, and to identify beliefs from which\ncommitment to it would follow. And he will, presumably, show himself\nsensitive to conditions under which it is appropriate to ascribe\npropositional attitudes embedding the statement to himself and to\nothers, and sensitive to the explanatory significance of such\nascriptions. In short: in these and perhaps other important respects,\nhe will show himself competent to use the sentence. But the headings\nunder which his practical abilities fall so far involve no mention of\nevidence-transcendent truth-conditions (Wright 1993: 17).\n\nThis establishes (8), and the conclusion (12) follows\nstraightforwardly.\n\nA detailed assessment of the plausibility of Dummett\u2019s arguments\nis impossible here. For a full response to the manifestation argument,\nsee Miller 2002. See also Byrne 2005. For Dummett\u2019s other\nargument, the acquisition argument, see Miller 2003b. Wright develops\na couple of additional arguments against semantic realism. For\nthese\u2014the argument from rule-following and the argument from\nnormativity\u2014see the Introduction to Wright 1993.
