But in a way it has also been a practice\nthroughout the history of philosophy. Throughout the history of\nphilosophy, at times more often than others, natural language has been\nused as method for clarifying intuitions, that is, states of\nintellectual seeming that contrast, very roughly, with inferential\nbelief, reasoning or reflection and that have been considered the\nprimary evidence in philosophy (see entry on\n intuition).\n In particular, natural language has played an important role in\nclarifying intuitions that bear on metaphysical issues.\n\nNatural language has been used, for example, by Fine (2003) to\nelucidate the intuitive distinction between an object and the material\nconstituting it While the statue may seem a distinct entity from the\nalloy that constitutes it, the distinction becomes particularly\nconvincing when paying attention to ranges of predicates that are or\naren\u2019t meaningfully applicable to the statue and the alloy. The\nstatue can be said to be \u201cdefective\u201d, \u201cwell\nmade\u201d, \u201cvaluable\u201d, \u201cugly\u201d,\n\u201cRomanesque\u201d, \u201cinsured\u201d, or\n\u201cadmired\u201d, even though the alloy which makes it up is not.\nSome predicates may not hold of the alloy; others cannot even be\napplied meaningfully to it, e.g., Romanesque. A philosopher\nthat denies an ontological distinction between an object and the\nmatter constituting it faces the considerable challenge of explaining\nthose differences in the applicability of predicates.\n\nAnother ontological distinction that has been elucidated significantly\nusing natural language is the distinction between objects and events.\nWhile some philosophers take objects and events to be of the same\ncategory and identify both with the material content of space-time\nregions, others distinguish them in the way they persist through time\n(endurance and perdurance, see entry on\n identity over time).\n Natural language gives significant support for the view that objects\nand events relate to time and space differently. The difference is\nreflected in the choice of existence predicates: exist\napplies to objects, but occur, take place, happen to events\n(* The palace existed / ??? happened, The murder\nhappened / ??? existed)); it also reflected in the\napplicability of spatial modifiers to the respective existence\npredicates (The party took place in the garden, ??? The\nflowers existed in the garden) (Hacker 1982; Cresswell 1986; Fine\n2006; Moltmann 2020b).\n\nPhilosophers when making use of natural language in such ways to\nclarify metaphysical intuitions practice natural language ontology\n(even if no distinction is made yet between what is reflected in such\nintuitions and what there really is, which is discussed in the next\nsection). They thereby generally presuppose that metaphysical\nintuitions do not show interpersonal inconsistencies (see entry on\n intuitions)\n and in their linguistic manifestation, cross-linguistic differences\n (\u00a74.2).\n\nAppeals to natural language of this kind can be found within different\napproaches to metaphysics, as long as the philosophers in questions\ntake metaphysical intuitions to be a basis for developing\nphilosophical views. They can be found, for example, in Aristotle and\nvery explicitly in medieval metaphysics (Aquinas, Buridan, Ockham),\nwhere the use of natural language examples was a common practice. It\ncan be found in the phenomenological tradition (Bolzano, Brentano,\nHusserl, Meinong), and, again quite explicitly, in early analytic\nphilosophy (Frege, Twardowski, Strawson, Austin, Vendler, Ryle).\nDrawing on natural language as a method of clarifying metaphysical\nintuitions is also common among many contemporary philosophers that do\nnot explicitly engage in natural language ontology as an emerging\ndiscipline, but just take a descriptive approach to metaphysics\n (\u00a71.6).\n \n",
