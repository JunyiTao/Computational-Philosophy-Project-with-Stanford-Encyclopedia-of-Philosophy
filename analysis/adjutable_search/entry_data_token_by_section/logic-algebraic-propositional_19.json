    "main_text": "Beyond protoalgebraic logics\n12. Beyond protoalgebraic logics\n\nNot all interesting logics are protoalgebraic. In this section we will\nbriefly discuss four examples of non-protoalgebraic logics: the logic\nof conjunction and disjunction, positive modal logic, the strict\nimplication fragment of \\(\\blK\\) and Visser\u2019s subintuitionistic\nlogic. All of them are selfextensional. In the next section, we will\nexpound the semantics of abstract logics and generalized matrices that\nserves to develop a really general theory of the algebraization of\nlogic systems. As we will see, the perspective changes in an important\nrespect from the perspective taken in logical matrix model theory.\n",
