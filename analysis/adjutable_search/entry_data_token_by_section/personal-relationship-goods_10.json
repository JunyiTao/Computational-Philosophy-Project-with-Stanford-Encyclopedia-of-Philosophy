    "main_text": "The Value of Personal Relationship Goods || Primary Goods as All-Purpose Goods\n3.5 Primary Goods as All-Purpose Goods\n\nSeveral arguments support the conclusion that certain personal\nrelationship goods are akin to primary goods in the sense that John\nRawls gives to this term: that is, goods whose distribution is a\nconcern of justice. A first reason is that some personal relationship\ngoods are all-purpose: whatever else one may want, one will need these\ngoods in order to pursue one\u2019s conception of a worthwhile life\n(Kittay 1999; Brake 2017; Cordelli 2015a, 2015b).\n\nAs Elizabeth Brake (2017) notes, not all goods that are necessary for\nthe pursuit of any life plan are properly conceived of as primary\ngoods:\n\n\nbeing normally needed for the pursuit of plans of life and the\ndevelopment and exercise of the moral powers are necessary, not\nsufficient conditions, for inclusion on the list of primary goods.\nAfter all, oxygen, water, and food are ineliminable to survival, but\nthey are not included on the list of primary goods. (p. 138)\n\n\nHowever, as she further notes, while individuals can buy various care\nservices, especially those concerning the meeting of material needs,\nthey cannot buy caring relationships. This means that the\nimplementation of just distributions of other goods cannot ensure that\nall individuals will have proper access to personal relationship\ngoods. Brake\u2019s example is that of elderly individuals living\nalone, with little mobility and without any social relations, for whom\nno level of material wealth alone can provide adequate conditions for\nforging caring relationships. If we cannot obtain (opportunities to\nenjoy) personal relationship goods in exchange for money, and if these\ngoods are all-purpose goods, then there is a Rawlsian case for\nincluding them on the agenda of justice (Brake 2017). (Note that,\nunder certain conditions, this could also qualify oxygen and clean\nwater as primary goods.)\n",
