Throughout the middle decades of the\ntwentieth century he exercised considerable influence on a number of\nareas of philosophical inquiry: especially on epistemology, the\nphilosophy of religion, and political theory.\n\nThe influence of Kant over Jaspers is widely acknowledged in the\nliterature, to the extent that he has been depicted as \u201cThe\nfirst and the last Kantian\u201d (Heinrich Barth, quoted in Ehrlich\n1975, 211). Usually this evaluation is based on his reliance on the\nsubjective-experiential transformation of Kantian philosophy, which\nreconstructs Kantian transcendentalism as a doctrine of particular\nexperience and spontaneous freedom, and emphasizes the constitutive\nimportance of lived existence for authentic knowledge. However,\ncurrent commentators of his philosophy have started questioning this\nview. Jaspers obtained his widest influence, not through his\nphilosophy, but through his writings on governmental conditions in\nGermany, and after the collapse of National Socialist regime he\nemerged as a powerful spokesperson for moral-democratic education and\nreorientation in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nDespite his importance in the evolution of both philosophy and\npolitical theory in twentieth-century Germany, today Jaspers is to a\nlarge extent a neglected thinker. The explanations that are given for\nthis are various. In the first place, it is argued that he did not\nfound a particular philosophical school. For him, philosophy is a way\nof thought, which uses expert knowledge while going beyond it. He\nbelieved that by means of devoting oneself to philosophy, individuals\ndo not cognize objects but explicate and actualize their being as\nthinkers and thus become themselves. Consequently, he did not attract\na cohort of apostles, and, outside Germany at least, his works are not\noften the subject of high philosophical discussion. This is partly the\nresult of the fact that the philosophers who now enjoy undisputed\ndominance in modern German philosophical history, especially Martin\nHeidegger, Georg Luk\u00e1cs and Theodor W. Adorno, wrote\ndisparagingly about Jaspers, and they were often unwilling to take his\nwork entirely seriously. Another explanation for Jaspers\u2019s\nrelative marginality relates to problematic nature of the English\ntranslations of his writings that render his thinking rather\nincommunicable to readers from English speaking countries. To be sure,\nhe was extremely fortunate with his many translators, the most\nprominent of whom are Ralph Manheim and E.B. Ashton. But the\ntranslations often use misleading expression, choose different words\nto express the very same word in the original German, and thus confuse\nthe readers. Also, unindicated omissions and other problems that\nresult from favouring aesthetic considerations over accuracy all\ncontribute to falsifying the original. It has been argued that Jaspers\ncould not appeal to the English-speaking philosophical mind due to\nbeing too speculative and metaphysical or simply beyond the reach of\nthe Anglo-American cultural horizons. To all these factors, one might\nadd the fact of Jaspers\u2019s association with the more prosaic\nperiods of German political life, and of his name being tarred with an\naura of staid bourgeois common sense. Nonetheless, Jaspers\u2019s\nwork set the parameters for a number of different philosophical\ndebates, the consequences of which remain deeply influential in\ncontemporary philosophy, and in recent years there have been signs\nthat a more favourable reconstructive approach to his work is\nbeginning to prevail.\n", "toc": [{"#Biog": "1.

Biography\n\nKarl Theodor Jaspers was born on 23rd February 1883 in the\nNorth German town of Oldenburg near the North Sea, where his ancestors\nhad lived for generations. He was the son of a banker and a\nrepresentative of the parliament (Landtagesabgeordneten), Carl Wilhelm\nJaspers (1850\u20131940) and Henriette Tantzen (1862\u20131941), who\nalso came from a family that was involved in local parliament.\nJaspers\u2019s family milieu was strongly influenced by the political\nculture of North German liberalism, and he often referred to the\nclimate of early liberal democratic thought as a formative aspect of\nhis education. Moreover, although he claimed not to have been\ninfluenced by any specifically ecclesiastical faith, his thought was\nalso formed by the spirit of North German Protestantism, and his\nphilosophical outlook can in many respects be placed in the\nreligiously inflected tradition of Kant and Kierkegaard.\n\nJaspers was a pupil at the Altes Gymnasium in Oldenburg.\nSince his early childhood, Jaspers suffered from chronic\nbronchiectasis that impaired his physical capabilities and awareness\nof his physical disabilities shaped his routine throughout his adult\nlife and formed his sensitivity to psychological issues, including\nhuman suffering. Jaspers attributed his ability to conduct a normative\nroutine and to devote his life to his creative work to his strict\ndiscipline regarding his health.\n\nIn 1910 he married Gertrud Mayer (1879\u20131974), who came from a\npious German-Jewish merchant family. At the time, she was working as\nan assistant in the sanatorium of the neurologist and psychiatrist\nOskar Kohnstamms (1871\u20131917) and was the sister of his close\nfriends Gustav Mayer and the philosopher Ernest Mayer. Only thanks to\nher marriage to the already known philosopher Karl Jaspers was Gertrud\nMayer able to stay in Germany during the Nazi period.\n2. Career\n\nJaspers received an extremely diverse and broad-ranging education. He\ninitially enrolled as a student of law at the University of Heidelberg\nfor three semesters (1901\u20131902). Despite his already vivid interest in\nphilosophy, which he explored through Spinoza\u2019s Ethics\n(1677) and Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason\n(1781),  he decided for medicine was based on his belief that\nit best illuminated life itself and the challenges of human existence.\nJaspers began his medicine studies in Berlin (1902/1903), then moved\nto Gottingen (1903\u20131906), and eventually finished them in Heidelberg\n(1906\u20131908). He submitted his dissertation, Heimweh und\nVerbrechen in 1908 and graduated M.D. in 1909. He was a research\nassistant in the psychiatric clinic of the university of Heidelberg\nfrom 1909\u20131915, where he worked with some of the most famous\npsychiatrists in Germany, including Nissl, Wilmanned, Gruhle, and\nMayer-Gross. Due to his illness with bronchiectasis, he was incapable\nof carrying out heavy duties in the clinic. The director of the\npsychiatric clinic of the university of Heidelberg, Franz Nissl,\npermitted him to spend the majority of his time at the library rather\nthan in the clinic and the laboratory. Indeed, his extraordinary\nskills of critical thinking and abstract observation on human\nsituations were evident already then. From 1913 onward, Jaspers read\nphilosophy systematically. In 1913 he published his Allgemeine\nPsychopathologie (General Psychopathology) which already\nmade apparent the viewpoints and methods that belong to the world of\nthe humanities and social studies that were regarded by him as\nconverging into psychopathology. In the same year, he obtained his\nsecond doctorate (Habilitation) in psychology from the\nPhilosophy Faculty at the University of Heidelberg, supervised by\nWilhelm Windelband. He was a lecturer and later an Associate Professor\nof Psychology (Privatdozent) from 1913 to 1921. During this\nperiod, in 1919, he published his Psychologie der\nWeltanschauungen (Psychology of World Views). This work\nis considered as a transitional work, in which his psychological\nmethod was clearly shaped by philosophical influences and objectives,\nand was already evolving into a consistent philosophical doctrine and\nacquiring some of the main issues that were to be explored later\nwithin his philosophy of existence. Then, in 1922, he took over the\nfull professorial chair of philosophy in the University of Heidelberg\n(after Heinrich Maier), a position from which he was dismissed in 1937\nby the Nazis. To a large extent, the two first major publications were\nworks of psychology that contain many elements, albeit in inchoate\nform, of his later philosophy. Following his nomination as professor,\nhe wrote nothing for ten years, except for two small works\u2014a\npatholography Stirnberg and van Gogh in 1922 and Die Idee\nder Universit\u00e4t (The Idea of the University) in 1923.\n\nWhile he was working as a psychiatrist in Heidelberg, Jaspers came\ninto contact with Max Weber, and also with the other intellectuals who\nwere grouped around Weber, including Ernst Bloch, Emil Lask, Georg\nSimmel, and Luk\u00e1cs. His intellectual formation was marked in a\nnumber of ways by this intellectual milieu. At a political level, he\nintegrated aspects of Weber\u2019s enthusiasm for heroic liberalism,\nresponsible nationalism and elite democracy into his own thought and\nattitudes. At a more theoretical level, his ideas were determined by\nthe increasingly critical responses to neo-Kantian philosophy, which\ndominated methodological discussions around Weber and Luk\u00e1cs,\nand which subsequently coloured the intellectual horizon during World\nWar I and throughout the Weimar Republic. This period witnessed the\ndethroning of neo-Kantianism as the philosophical orthodoxy in the\nGerman academic establishment, and it was marked by a proliferation of\nphilosophical models which rejected Kantian formalism and sought to\nintegrate experiential, historical and even sociological elements into\nphilosophical discourse. The attempt to rescue Kantian philosophy from\nthe legalistic formalism of the South West German School of\nneo-Kantian philosophy, centred around Heinrich Rickert and Wilhelm\nWindelband, became one of the central features of Jaspers\u2019s\nwork, and in many ways his entire philosophical evolution was\nmotivated by the desire to reconstruct Kantian thought, not as a\nformalist doctrine of self-legislation, but as an account of\nmetaphysical experience, spontaneously decisive freedom, and authentic\ninner life. His early career as professor of philosophy was also\ndeeply (and adversely) affected by neo-Kantian hostility to his work.\nIndeed, both neo-Kantians and phenomenological philosophers subjected\nhis work to trenchant criticism in the early stages of his\nphilosophical trajectory, and members of both these camps, especially\nRickert and Edmund Husserl, accused him of importing anthropological\nand experiential questions into philosophy and thus of contaminating\nphilosophical analysis with contents properly pertaining to other\ndisciplines.\n\nIf Weber was the first decisive personal influence and Kant was the\nfirst decisive philosophical influence on Jaspers, in the early 1920s\nhe encountered a further figure who assumed a decisive role in his\nformation: that is, Martin Heidegger. It cannot be claimed without\nqualification that Heidegger directly determined the conceptual\nstructure or underlying preconditions of Jaspers\u2019s work, nor\nthat Heidegger assimilated aspects of Jaspers\u2019s thought into his\nown philosophy. Throughout their theoretical trajectories, the\ndifferences between Heidegger and Jaspers were in many ways greater\nthan the similarities. Indeed, the theoretical controversies between\nthem eventually culminated in an embittered personal and political\naltercation, caused by Heidegger\u2019s publicly declared sympathy\nfor the National Socialists in 1933. Jaspers felt himself personally\nthreatened by Heidegger\u2019s infamous decision to support the\nNazis, as he was married to a Jewish woman, and he had previously\nattached himself to eminent liberal politicians and philosophers, most\nnotably Weber, who were now vilified by Heidegger and other\nintellectuals attached to the NSDAP. In 1933, Jaspers himself was\nbriefly tempted into making certain incautiously optimistic statements\nabout the Hitler regime. Indeed, these were remarks were not entirely\nout of keeping with his other publications of the early 1930s. In the\nlast years of the Weimar Republic he published a controversial\npolitical work, Die geistige Situation der Zeit (The\nSpiritual Condition of the Age, 1931), which\u2014to his later\nacute embarrassment\u2014contained a carefully worded critique of\nparliamentary democracy. Throughout this period, he also stressed the\nrelevance of Weberian ideas of strong leadership for the preservation\nof political order in Germany. The souring of his relations with\nHeidegger, however, seems to have hardened his mind into a strict and\nsustained opposition to National Socialism, and, unlike Heidegger, his\nworks of the 1930s avoided political themes and were largely\nconcentrated on elaborating the interior or religious aspects of his\nphilosophy. In 1932, he published his trilogy Philosophie,\nconsisting of three separate volumes, each based on its own object of\ntranscending: Weltorientierung (Orientation of the World),\nExistenzerhellung (Illumination of Existence) and\nMetaphysik (Metaphysics). This book is generally considered\nas his magnum opus and he testified in retrospect that is was\nthe closest work to his heart. The choice not to grant the book the\nexpected title of \u201cExistential Philosophy\u201d, despite the\nextensive use of the term Existenzphilosophie, reflects his\ndiscontent about its narrowing his guiding ideal of Philosophia\nPerennis. Later in his Vernunft und Widervernunft in unserer\nZeit (Reason and Anti-Reason in Our Time), from 1950 he would\nexpress his preference for the expression \u2018philosophy of\nreason\u2019.\n\nDespite the at times envenomed relations between them, however,\nHeidegger and Jaspers are usually associated with each other as the\ntwo founding fathers of existential philosophy in Germany. This\ninterpretation of their philosophical status and relationship is at\nleast questionable. Heidegger resented being described as an\nexistentialist, and Jaspers, at least after 1933, resented being\nidentified with Heidegger. Even during their early friendship\nHeidegger was very critical of Jaspers\u2019s philosophy; he wrote a\ncommentary on Psychology of World Views, in which he claimed\nthat Jaspers\u2019s methodological approach remained ensnared in the\nfalsehoods of subjectivist metaphysics and Cartesian ontology, and\nthat it illegitimately introduced the categories of Weberian sociology\ninto philosophical analysis. Similarly, throughout his life Jaspers\nkept a book of critical notes on Heidegger, and he routinely described\nHeidegger\u2019s fundamental ontology in a tone of moral-humanistic\ndisapprobation. Nonetheless, there remains a residue of validity in\nthe common association of Heidegger and Jaspers, and, although it\nrequires qualification, this association is not in every respect\nmisleading. Existentialism was, and remains, a highly diffuse\ntheoretical movement, and it cannot be expected that two philosophers\nconnected with this movement should hold similar views in all\nrespects. However, existentialism had certain unifying features, and\nmany of these were common to both Jaspers and Heidegger. In the early\nstages of its evolution, therefore, existentialism might be described\nas a theoretical stance which: a) moved philosophical discourse away\nfrom Kantian formalism and emphasized the belief that the content of\nthought must reside in particular experiences and decisions; b)\nfollowed Kierkegaard in defining philosophy as a passionate and deeply\nengaged activity, in which the integrity and the authenticity of the\nhuman being are decisively implicated; c) sought to overcome the\nantinomies (reason/experience; theory/praxis; transcendence/immanence;\npure reason/practical reason) which determine the classical\nmetaphysical tradition by incorporating all aspects (cognitive,\npractical and sensory) of human life in an encompassing account of\nrational and experiential existence. If this definition of\nexistentialism is accepted, then the suggestion of a family connection\nbetween Jaspers and Heidegger cannot be entirely repudiated, for both\ncontributed to the reorganization of philosophical questioning in the\n1920s in a manner which conforms to this definition. Ultimately,\nhowever, relations between Heidegger and Jaspers degenerated to a\nterminal impasse, and after World War II Jaspers refused to explain or\nexonerate Heidegger\u2019s political actions during the Nazi years\nand he even recommended to a de-Nazification committee that Heidegger\nshould be suspended from his university teaching responsibilities.\n\nDuring the Nazi period from 1933 onwards, Jaspers was excluded from\nany co-operation in the administration of the university until he was\ndismissed from his chair as a professor in 1937 and was subject to a\npublication ban (Publikationsverbot). During the war, he and\nhis wife were in no physical danger. Yet he felt himself a marked man\nuntil the end of World War II. Jaspers once heard indirectly that\nthere was a plan to deport him and his wife to a concentration camp in\nthe middle of April 1945. Fortunately, the American troops arrived in\nHeidelberg two weeks earlier, on April 1st 1945. However,\nafter 1945, his fortunes changed dramatically, and he figured\nprominently on the White List of the US-American occupying forces:\nthat is, on the list of politicians and intellectuals who were deemed\nuntarnished by any association with the NSDAP, and who were allowed to\nplay a public role in the process of German political re-foundation.\nFrom this time on Jaspers defined himself primarily as a popular\nphilosopher and educator. In the first role, he contributed extensive\nedifying commentaries on questions of political orientation and civic\nmorality\u2014first, in the interim state of 1945\u20131949, and\nthen, after 1949, in the early years of the Federal Republic of\nGermany. In the second role, as one of the professors responsible for\nreopening the University of Heidelberg, to which he was appointed by\nthe American Army of Occupation as a contemporary rector, he wrote at\nlength on the necessity of university reforms, he emphasized the role\nof liberal humanistic education as a means of disseminating democratic\nideas throughout Germany, and he took a firm line against the\nrehabilitation of professors with a history of Nazi affiliation. In\n1946, The Idea of the University was published in an\nessentially different form from the book with the same title from\n1923. The later work presents the university as a free community of\nscholars and students engaged in the task of seeking truth. As such,\nthe university and the scholars that populate it can and should play a\ndecisive role in rehabilitation of Europe based on the noblest ideas\nof the enlightenment. At that time and still, Jaspers is one of few\nwho can justly speak for value and the need for such a stance against\nthe threats upon freedom and humanity. The acknowledgment of\nJaspers\u2019s noble humanism in the first years after the war is\napparent in the numerous honors granted to him, including the Goethe\nPrize in 1947, the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1958, the\nErasmus Prize in 1959, and the Prize of the Foundation of Oldenburg\nfor Honorary Citizens.\n\nOf his post-1945 publications, therefore, Jaspers\u2019s political\ncontributions are perhaps the most significant. His contribution to\nthe promotion of a democratic civic culture in West Germany at this\ntime was of great importance, and his writings and radio broadcasts\nshaped, in part, the gradually evolving democratic consensus of the\nearly Federal Republic. In Die Schuldfrage (The Question\nof German Guilt, 1946), published at the time of the\nN\u00fcrnberg trials, he argued that, although not all Germans could\nbe legitimately brought to trial for war crimes, all Germans should\naccept an implicit complicity in the holocaust and only the critical\nself-reflection of all Germans could lead to cultural and political\nrenewal. In the 1950s, he supported the main policies of the\nliberal-conservative governments led by Konrad Adenauer\n(1949\u20131963), and he particularly endorsed the formation of the\nWestern Alliance, which he saw as a means of protecting the cultural\nresources of Western European culture from their colonization by the\nSoviet Union. Throughout this time, however, the cautiously\nconservative tenor of Jaspers\u2019s political thought was\nprogressively modified by his frequent and at times intense\nintellectual exchanges with Hannah Arendt, who might well be seen as\nthe fourth great influence on his work. Jaspers had been\nArendt\u2019s tutor and supervisor before she emigrated from Germany\nin the 1930s, but the period after 1945 saw something of a role\nreversal in this relationship, which Jaspers seems to have accepted\nquite graciously. Influenced by Arendt\u2019s agonistic\nrepublicanism, he gradually turned against the relatively complacent\nspirit of political and intellectual restoration in the early Federal\nRepublic, and he finally devoted himself to elaborating models of\ncitizenship founded in constitutional rights and legally enshrined\nidentities. In this respect, he can be viewed as an important\nprecursor of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, and his works contain an early\nconception of the doctrine later known as constitutional\npatriotism. His views on German re-unification were also\nparticularly influential; he opposed the dominant outlooks of the time\nby claiming that the demand for re-unification meant that German\npolitics remained infected with the damaging traces of old\ngeo-political ideas and ambitions, and it prevented the fundamental\nredirection of German political life. Finally, then, in symbolic\ndemonstration of disgust at the persistence of pernicious political\nattitudes in Germany he relinquished his German citizenship, and,\nhaving earlier moved across the border to University of Basel in 1948,\nhe became a Swiss national. In his last works, he placed himself\ncloser to the political left, and he even argued that only a legal\nrevolution could ensure that the German state was organized on the\nbasis of a morally decisive constitution. He died of a stroke in\nBasel, Switzerland on February 26 1969 at the age of 86. His wife,\nGertrud Jaspers, who served as his amanuensis throughout his entire\nlife as a scholar, died in Basel on May 25 1974 at the age of 95.\n3. Early Psychiatric Writings\n\nLess well-known, at least among the world of English-speaking\npsychiatry, is Jaspers\u2019s lasting contribution to the field of\npsychiatry that preceded his philosophical work, and in retrospect\ntranspires as not wholly unrelated it, at least in its common guiding\nspirit. During his distinguished career as a psychiatrist, Jaspers\nachieved an outstanding contribution to psychiatric thinking, later\ncalled \u2018The Heidelberg School\u2019 and led by Kurt Schneider.\nAs a young man, he authored a number of scientific articles on\nhomesickness and crime, on intelligence tests, on hallucinations\n\u2013 all illustrated with detailed case histories. Also, Jaspers\npublished reports of the mental pathology of Van Gogh and Stirnberg.\nAmong these, of special importance are his outstanding article from\n1910, in which he introduced his method and fundamental principles\nregarding \u2018mental processes\u2019 and \u2018personality\ndevelopment\u2019, and an article on the phenomenological method in\npsychiatry from 1912, which established his pioneer status as a first\ncommentator on the phenomenological study of subjective experiences at\nthe conscious level. At the age of barely thirty, in 1913, while he\nwas working as a physician in the psychiatric hospital at Heidelberg,\nJaspers published his Allgemeine Psychopathologie: Ein Leitfaden\nf\u00fcr Studierenden, \u00c4rzte und Psychologen (General\nPsychopathology: A Guide for Students, Physicians and Psychologists).\nThe aims of this book were to provide the framework of the scientific\nfield of psychopathology and its related facts and approaches, not\nonly for practitioners in this filed but also for interested\nintellectuals. This framework covers the problems and methods that\ncapture the body of knowledge of the field rather than empirical\nevidence or a system based on a theory. Instead of deciding between\nthe different existing approaches of his time, he stressed their\npeculiarity that entails the inherent justifications and the way they\nmight complement each other and together portray the many sides of the\npsychopathological science. The hint of the spirit of his existential\nphilosophy, yet to become expressed, is apparent in his declaration in\nthe preface of the book, according to which \u201cin psychopathology\nit is dangerous merely to learn the matter, our task is not to\n\u2018learn psychopathology\u2019 but to learn to observe, ask\nquestions, analyze, and think in psychopathological terms\u201d.\nHowever, despite the very impressive of the achievement of the\nmentioned book, which within the German speaking world was recognized\nby leading psychiatrists as a monumental achievement in the field, it\nmarked the culmination of Jaspers\u2019s psychiatric productivity.\nJust two years later, Jaspers moved away forever from psychiatric\npractice and medicine in general, first towards psychology and then\nphilosophy. Interestingly, though, Jaspers saw fit to revise and\nexpand the text in a few of its several editions. The first edition is\nthe shortest. In the second and third editions, there were minor\nchanges. The most considerably revised and expanded edition is the\nfourth, which appeared in 1942. To a large extent, the integration of\nmany ideas from his then already mature existential philosophy from\nthe thirties onwards, which more than doubled the scope of the text,\nin fact amount to a new version of the book. Now, the subtitle that\nappeared in the earlier versions was removed and in the preface\nJaspers indicates its high aim of satisfying the demand for knowledge,\nnot only for physicians but for all who make mankind their theme. In\nthis enlarged version of the book, the imprint of Husserl\u2019s\ndescriptive psychology is apparent in the attempt to address the inner\nmental experiences of mentally ill people (mainly schizophrenic\npatients) and regard them as indicative of the general phenomena of\nhuman consciousness, i.e.: delusions, modes of ego-consciousness, and\nmodes of emotions. At the same time, the imprint of Wilhelm Dilthey\n(1833\u20131911) was perceptible in the centrality given to the\ndistinction between \u2018understanding psychology\u2019\n(Verstehende Psychologie), which relates to meaningful and\ncomprehensible connections that are inherent in one\u2019s\npersonality and biography, and \u2018explaining psychology\u2019\n(Erkl\u00e4rende Psychologie), which focuses on causal\nconnections that are mainly rooted in\n biology.1]\n\nJaspers\u2019s declared conviction that the methodological principles\nremain largely unaffected by the increased materials supported his\nefforts to add entire sections to the new versions of the book \u2013\nsections that aptly reveal his philosophical view on the pertinent\nconsiderations in curing mental illness. Notwithstanding this, Jaspers\nopposed the attempts to address existentialist ideas for the sake of\nunderstanding mental illness. For him it is not possible that a human\nbeing as a whole falls ill or alternatively that illness of any kind\ncan cover one\u2019s entire being, rather there are always parts that\nremain uninfected with illness or healthy.\n\nIt is worth noting that the appearance of the fourth edition of\nGeneral Psychopathology was enabled despite the publication\nban to which Jaspers was subject since 1938 for his outspoken and\nuncompromising resistance to the Nazis regime and his persistent\nloyalty to his Jewish wife. Probably the same title from 1913 and the\nscientific character, which covered the fact of incorporation of the\nof considerable sections which where imprinted with his philosophical\nthinking, were helpful in this regard. Despite ceasing practicing\npsychiatry, Jaspers retain his interest in psychopathology and was\nfully aware of the developments in the field, in particular regarding\nthe neurological and somatic aspects of mental illness. However, after\nthe fourth edition appeared, five more were printed in the same format\nas the fourth, the latest appearing in 1973. An English translation\nexists for the seventh edition only and was published in 1963 by J.\nHoenig and Miriam Hamilton. For various reasons\u2014starting from\nnot considering the \u2018real causes\u2019 of mental illness,\ncontinuing with its loaded style of writing and argumentation, its\nsevere (though inconsistent) criticism of psychoanalysis, which at\nthat time was regarded as indispensable in any consideration of\npsychopathology, and other reasons\u2014the reception of General\nPsychopathology in the English-speaking countries was far from\nenthusiastic, except for the most respectful, and was sometimes even\nhostile.\n4. The Philosophical Writings\n\nJaspers\u2019s first intervention in philosophical debate,\nPsychology of World Views, constructed a typology of mental\nattitudes, which, close to Weber\u2019s model of ideal types, was\nintended to provide an interpretive account of basic psychological\ndispositions. The underlying argument in this work is that the\nconstitutive fact of human mental life is the division between subject\nand object (Subjekt-Objekt-Spaltung). Human psychological\nforms\u2014or world views\u2014are positioned as antinomical moments\nwithin this founding antinomy, and they give distinct paradigmatic\nexpression to the relation between human subjective inclinations and\nfreedoms and the objective phenomena which the subject encounters.\nUnlike Weber, however, Jaspers argued that the construction of world\nviews is not a merely neutral process, to be judged in non-evaluative\nmanner. Instead, all world views contain an element of pathology; they\nincorporate strategies of defensiveness, suppression and subterfuge,\nand they are concentrated around false certainties or spuriously\nobjectivized modes of rationality, into which the human mind withdraws\nin order to obtain security amongst the frighteningly limitless\npossibilities of human existence. World views, in consequence,\ncommonly take the form of objectivized cages (Geh\u00e4use),\nin which existence hardens itself against contents and experiences\nwhich threaten to transcend or unbalance the defensive restrictions\nwhich it has placed upon its operations. Although some world views\npossess an unconditioned component, most world views exist as the\nlimits of a formed mental apparatus. It is the task of\npsychological intervention, Jaspers thus argued, to guide human\nexistence beyond the restricted antinomies around which it stabilizes\nitself, and to allow it decisively to confront the more authentic\npossibilities, of subjective and objective life, which it effaces\nthrough its normal rational dispositions and attitudes.\n\nIn addition to this psychological typology, Jaspers\u2019s analysis\nof world views also contains a wider critique of human rationality.\nMost modes of rationality, he suggested, are conveniently instrumental\nor ideological forms, which serve distinct subjective and objective\nfunctions, and they habitually stand in the way of genuine knowledge.\nAt the same time, however, he also claimed that rationality possesses\ncapacities of communicative integrity and phenomenological\nself-overcoming, and, if authentically exercised, it is able to escape\nits narrowly functional form, to expose itself to new contents beyond\nits limits and antinomies, and to elaborate new and more cognitively\nunified conceptual structures. He therefore indicated that\nformal-epistemological concepts of rationality must be expanded to\nrecognize that experience and committed actions are formative of\nauthentic knowledge, and that reason cannot, in Cartesian manner, be\nmonadically dislocated from its historical, sensory, experiential and\nvoluntaristic foundations. From the outset, therefore, Jaspers\u2019s\nwork, although methodologically marked by Weber, was also indelibly\nstamped by Hegel\u2019s philosophy, and it sought to integrate the\npreconditions of Hegel\u2019s phenomenology into a systematic\npsychological doctrine. Indeed, at this early stage in his development\nJaspers\u2019s thought hinged on an existential\u2014or\nKierkegaardian\u2014alteration of Hegelian philosophy. In this, he\ntransposed the dialectical process through which Hegel accounted for\nthe overcoming of cognitive antinomies in the emergence of\nself-consciousness into an analysis of cognitive formation which sees\nthe resolution of reason\u2019s antinomies as effected through vital\nexperiences, decisive acts of self-confrontation, or communicative\ntranscendence.\n\nIn this early work, Jaspers introduced several concepts which assumed\ngreat importance for all his work. Most importantly, this work\ncontains a theory of the limit (Grenze). This term designates\nboth the habitual forms and attitudes of the human mental apparatus,\nand the experiences of the mind as it recognizes these attitudes as\nfalsely objectivized moments within its antinomical structure, and as\nit transcends these limits by disposing itself in new ways towards\nitself and its objects. In his early philosophy Jaspers thus ascribed\ncentral status to \u2018limit situations\u2019\n(Grenzsituationen). Limit situations are moments, usually\naccompanied by experiences of dread, guilt or acute anxiety, in which\nthe human mind confronts the restrictions and pathological narrowness\nof its existing forms, and allows itself to abandon the securities of\nits limitedness, and so to enter new realm of self-consciousness. In\nconjunction with this, then, this work also contains a theory of the\nunconditioned (das Unbedingte). In this theory,\nJaspers argued that limit situations are unconditioned moments of\nhuman existence, in which reason is drawn by intense impulses or\nimperatives, which impel it to expose itself to the limits of its\nconsciousness and to seek higher or more reflected modes of knowledge.\nThe unconditioned, a term transported from Kantian doctrines of\nsynthetic regress, is thus proposed by Jaspers as a vital impetus in\nreason, in which reason encounters its form as conditioned or limited\nand desires to transcend the limits of this form. In relation to this,\nthen, Jaspers\u2019s early psychological work also introduced, albeit\ninchoately, the concept of existential communication. In\nthis, he argued that the freedom of consciousness to overcome its\nlimits and antinomies can only be elaborated through speech: that is,\nas a process in which consciousness is elevated beyond its limits\nthrough intensely engaged communication with other persons, and in\nwhich committed communication helps to suspend the prejudices and\nfixed attitudes of consciousness. Existentially open consciousness is\ntherefore always communicative, and it is only where it abandons its\nmonological structure that consciousness can fully elaborate its\nexistential possibilities. In this early doctrine of communication,\nJaspers helped to shape a wider communicative and intersubjective\nshift in German philosophy; indeed, the resonances of his existential\nhermeneutics remained palpable in the much later works of Hans-Georg\nGadamer and Paul Ricoeur. Less obviously, however, in this doctrine he\nalso guided early existential thinking away from its original\nassociation with Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and, although assimilating\nKierkegaardian elements of decisiveness and impassioned commitment, he\nclaimed that Kierkegaard\u2019s cult of interiority, centred in the\nspeechlessness of inner life, was a miscarried attempt to envision the\nconditions of human authenticity. The decision for authentic\nself-overcoming and cognitive unity can only occur, he argued, through\nshared participation in dialogue.\n\nThe major publication of Jaspers\u2019s earlier period, and probably\nof his entire career, is the three-volume work: Philosophy\n(1932). In this work, he retained the partly Hegelian focus of his\nearlier publications, and he followed the spirit of Hegelian\nphenomenology in providing an account of the formation of human\nconsciousness, which grasps consciousness as proceeding from the level\nof immediate knowledge and progressing through a sequence of\nantinomies towards a level of truthfully unified reflection and\nself-knowledge. In this, Jaspers again accentuated the claim that the\nantinomies which reason encounters and resolves in its unfolding as\ntruth are at once both cognitive and experiential antinomies, and that\nthe lived moments of human existence are always of cognitively\nconstitutive relevance for the formation of consciousness. These ideas\nin fact remained central to Jaspers\u2019s philosophy throughout its\nsubsequent evolution. In his later philosophical works, especially\nVon der Wahrheit (Of Truth, 1947), he continued to\ngive prominence to cognitive models derived from Hegelian\nphenomenology, and he proposed a concept of the encompassing\n(das Umgreifende) to determine the phenomenological\ngradations of thought and being. However, in addition to its concern\nwith Hegelian themes, Philosophy also contains a fundamental\nreconstruction of Kantian themes, it has its foundation in a critical\nreconstruction of Kant\u2019s doctrine of transcendental ideas, and\nit is built around an endeavour to explain the elements of Kantian\nidealism as a systematic doctrine of subjective-metaphysical\nexperience.\n\nThe three volumes of Philosophy bear the titles\nPhilosophical World Orientation (volume I), The\nIllumination of Existence (volume II), and Metaphysics\n(volume III). It was written during the 1920s after Jaspers obtained\nthe full professorship at Heidelberg University. Each volume of this\nbook thus describes a particular way of being: orientation,\nexistence and metaphysical transcendence are the\nthree essential existential modalities of human life. At the same\ntime, each volume also describes a particular way of knowing, which is\ncorrelated with a way of being: orientation is cognitively determined\nby objectively verifiable knowledge or by positive or scientific\nproof-forms, existence is determined by subjective/existential\nself-reflection, and transcendence is determined by the symbolic\ninterpretation of metaphysical contents. Together, the three volumes\nof Philosophy are designed to show how human existence and\nhuman knowledge necessarily progress from one level of being and one\nlevel of knowledge to another, and how consciousness gradually\nevolves, through confrontation with its own antinomies, from an\nimmediate and unformed state towards a condition of unity and integral\nself-experience. The three volumes are consequently bound together by\nthe argument that at the level of immediate objective\nknowledge\u2014of orientation in the world\u2014human consciousness\nraises subjective-existential questions about itself and the grounds\nof its truth which it cannot resolve at this level of consciousness,\nand it encounters antinomies which call it to reflect existentially\nupon itself and to elevate it to the level of existence or\nexistentially committed self-reflection. At this higher level of\nconsciousness, then, existence raises metaphysical questions about\nitself and its origin which it cannot begin to answer without an\nawareness that existence is, at an originary or authentic level,\ntranscendent, and that its truth is metaphysical.\n\nEach level of being in Jaspers\u2019s Philosophy corresponds\nto one of the Kantian transcendental ideas, and the modes of thinking\nand knowing defining each level of existence elucidate the\nintellectual content of Kant\u2019s ideas. The level of orientation\nin the world corresponds to the idea of the unity of the world; the\nlevel of existence corresponds to the idea of the soul\u2019s\nimmortality; the level of transcendence corresponds to the idea of\nGod\u2019s necessary existence. However, whereas Kant saw\ntranscendental ideas as the formal-regulative ideas of reason,\nserving, at most, to confer systematic organization on reason\u2019s\nimmanent operations, Jaspers viewed transcendental ideas as realms of\nlived knowledge, through which consciousness passes and by whose\nexperienced antinomies it is formed and guided to a knowledge of\nitself as transcendent. Jaspers thus attributed to\ntranscendental ideas a substantial and experiential content. Ideas do\nnot, as for Kant, simply mark the formal limits of knowledge, marking\nout the bounds of sense against speculative or metaphysical questions.\nInstead, ideas provide a constant impulsion for reason to overcome its\nlimits, and to seek an ever more transcendent knowledge of itself, its\ncontents and its possibilities. In his mature philosophy, therefore,\nJaspers transformed the Kantian transcendental ideas into ideas of\ntranscendence, in which consciousness apprehends and elaborates\nthe possibility of substantial or metaphysical knowledge and\nself-knowledge. Central to this adjustment to Kant\u2019s conception\nof ideas was also an implied, yet quite fundamental critique of the\nkey Kantian distinction between the transcendent and the\ntranscendental. In contrast to contemporary neo-Kantian readings of\nKant, which were prepared to acknowledge the ideal element in Kantian\nidealism only, at most, as a regulative framework, generated by\nreason\u2019s own autonomous functions, Jaspers argued that Kantian\nphilosophy always at once contains and suppresses a vision of\nexperienced transcendence, and that the Kantian ideas should be viewed\nas challenges to reason to think beyond the limits of its autonomy,\ntowards new and more authentic contents, self-experiences and\nfreedoms.\n\nIn replacing the transcendental with the transcendent, however,\nJaspers did not argue that transcendent contents are obtainable as\npositive elements of human knowledge. On the contrary, he argued that\nconsciousness only acquires knowledge of its transcendence by\ncontemplating the evanescent ciphers of transcendence, which\nsignify the absolute limits of human consciousness. These ciphers\nmight be encountered in nature, in art, in religious symbolism, or in\nmetaphysical philosophy. But it is characteristic of all ciphers that,\nin alluding to transcendence, they also withhold transcendent\nknowledge from consciousness, and that they can only act as indices of\nthe impossibility of such knowledge. The attitude of consciousness\nwhich apprehends its limits and its possible transcendence can\ntherefore only be an attitude of foundering or failing\n(Scheitern), and transcendence can intrude in human\nconsciousness only as an experience of the absolute insufficiency of\nthis consciousness for interpreting its originary or metaphysical\ncharacter. At this level, then, although opposing the formality and\nexperiential vacuity of neo-Kantianism, Jaspers also accepted the\noriginal Kantian prohibition on positive transcendent or metaphysical\nknowledge. He argued that consciousness always has a metaphysical\norientation to be other than, or transcendent to, its existing forms,\nbut he also claimed that this orientation can only factually culminate\nin a crisis of transcendence, or in a crisis of metaphysics. Although\nreconsolidating the metaphysical aspects of Kantian philosophy,\ntherefore, Jaspers\u2019s own metaphysics is always a post-Kantian\nmetaphysics: it is a negative metaphysics, which resists all\nsuggestion that human reason might give itself an account of\nmetaphysical essences, which defines the realm of human meaning as\nformed by its difference against positive metaphysical knowledge, but\nwhich nonetheless sees reason, in Kierkegaardian manner, as driven by\na despairing desire for metaphysical transcendence.\n\nJaspers\u2019s metaphysical reconstruction of Kantian idealism has\nbeen denounced by other philosophers, most notably those in the broad\nmilieu of the Frankfurt School, as a stage in a wider course of\ncognitive degeneration, which falsely translates absolute metaphysical\ncontents into moments of human inner experience. Despite this, there\nare good grounds for arguing that Jaspers\u2019s metaphysics is an\nimportant critique of the fully autonomist accounts of rationality\nproposed by neo-Kantianism, and it even coincides with the critiques\nof Kantian formalism which underpinned the philosophies widely\nassociated with the Frankfurt School. Jaspers intuited that Kantian\ntranscendentalism suppressed a deep-lying impulse for transcendence,\nand this aspect of Kant\u2019s thought was badly neglected by\ninterpreters who saw Kant\u2019s philosophy as a doctrine of pure\nimmanence or autonomy. Adorno\u2019s later argument that Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism always contains a lament over the closure of\nreason against transcendence was thus anticipated by Jaspers, albeit\nin subjectivist terms, and Jaspers and Adorno\u2014for all their\npolitical differences\u2014can be placed close together as thinkers\nwho endeavoured to revitalize the metaphysical traces in idealism. In\nany case, Jaspers\u2019s insistence, contra Kant and the\nneo-Kantians, that reason itself is not the sole source of knowledge,\nand that the task of reason is not proscriptively to circumscribe the\nsphere of its validity against transcendence, but to overcome its\ncognitive limits and to envision contents which cannot be generated by\nits own autonomous functions, deserves to be rehabilitated as an\nabidingly significant contribution to modern debates on metaphysics\nand epistemology.\n5. Philosophy and Religion\n\nThe influences of Weber, Kant, Hegel and Kierkegaard are not difficult\nto discern in Jaspers\u2019s work. Similarly, it is also not\ndifficult to identify the ways in which his work was influenced by\nNietzsche. Jaspers borrowed from Nietzsche a psychologistic approach\nto philosophical perspectives, and, like Nietzsche, he tended to view\nphilosophical claims, not as formally verifiable postulates, but as\nexpressions of underlying mental dispositions. For this reason, he\nalso borrowed from Nietzsche a dismissive approach to absolutized\nclaims to truthful knowledge, and a resultant rejection of all\nrational purism. Most especially, however, like Heidegger, he took\nfrom Nietzsche a critical approach to the residues of metaphysics in\nEuropean philosophy, and he denied the existence of essences which are\nexternal or indifferent to human experience. At the same time,\nhowever, Jaspers also clearly positioned his philosophy against many\nelements of the Nietzschean legacy. He was clearly opposed to the\nnaturalistic vitalism evolving from Nietzsche\u2019s work, and his\nemphasis on human subjectivity as a locus of truthful transcendence\nmeant that Kierkegaard, rather than Nietzsche, was the existential\nprototype for his work.\n\nOne further important formative influence on Jaspers\u2019s\nphilosophy, however, was Schelling. Although he was at times critical\nof the simple mysticism and the metaphysics of natural process in\nSchelling\u2019s religious works, his metaphysical reconstruction of\nKantian idealism rearticulated some elements of the positive\nphilosophy of the later Schelling, and it mirrored his attempt to\naccount for truthful knowledge as a cognitive experience in which\nreason is transfigured by its encounter with contents other than its\nown form. In this respect, Jaspers adopted from Schelling a\nnon-identitarian model of cognitive life, which views true (or\ntruthful) knowledge as obtained through acts of positive\ninterpretation and revelation at the limits of rational consciousness.\nUnlike Schelling, he always rejected claims to absolute positive\nknowledge; to this extent, he remained\u2014in the ultimate\nanalysis\u2014a Kantian philosopher. However, he was clearly\nsympathetic to Schelling\u2019s critique of formal epistemological\nnegativism. Indeed, through his hermeneutical transformation of\nidealism into a metaphysics of symbolic interpretation, he might be\nseen, like both Schelling and Johann Georg Hamann before him, as a\nphilosopher who was intent on re-invoking the truth of revelation, as\nan absolute and non-identical content of knowledge, against the\nrational evidences of epistemology, and so on elaborating an\ninterpretive methodology adapted to a conception of truth as disclosed\nor revealed.\n\nThe discrete but important influence of Schelling on Jaspers\u2019s\nphilosophy also provides a clue to understanding Jaspers\u2019s\nphilosophy of religion. At one level, Jaspers was philosophically\ncommitted to a sympathetic retrieval of religious contents. He was\ninsistent that truth can only be interpreted as an element of radical\nalterity in reason, or as reason\u2019s experience of its own limits.\nSimilarly, he was insistent that the conditions of human freedom are\nnot generated by human reason alone, but are experienced as incursions\nof transcendence in rational thought. For these reasons, his\nphilosophy is sympathetic towards the primary implications of\nrevelation theology, and it cautiously upholds the essential\nphilosophical claim of revelation: namely, that truth is a disclosure\nof otherness (transcendence) to reason, or at least an interpreted\nmoment of otherness in reason. At the same time, however, Jaspers\ncannot in any obvious way be described as a religious philosopher. In\nfact, he was very critical of revelation theology, and of orthodox\nreligions more generally, on a number of quite separate counts. First,\nhe argued that the centre of religion is always formed by a falsely\nobjectivized or absolutized claim to truth, which fails to recognize\nthat transcendence occurs in many ways, and that transcendent truths\ncannot be made concrete as a set of factual statements or narratives.\nReligious world views are therefore examples of limited mental\nattitudes, which seek a hold in uniform doctrine in order to evade a\nconfrontation with the uncertainty and instability of transcendence.\nIn positing transcendence as a realized element of revelation,\nreligion in fact obstructs the capacity for transcendence which all\npeople possess; religion claims to offer transcendence, but it\nactually obstructs it. Second, then, as the foundations of dogma and\ndoctrinal orthodoxy, revealed truth-claims eliminate the self-critical\nand communicative aspect of human reason, and they undermine the\ndialogical preconditions of transcendence and existential\nself-knowledge. Jaspers thus viewed orthodox religion as an\nobstruction to communication, which places dogmatic limits on the\ncommon human capacity for truthfulness and transcendence. Nonetheless,\nas a philosopher of transcendence, he was also clear that human\ntruthfulness, or humanity more generally, cannot be conceived without\na recuperation of religious interpretive approaches and without a\nrecognition of the fact that the founding contents of philosophy are\ntranscendent. Much of his work, in consequence, might be construed as\nan attempt to free the contents of religious thinking from the\ndogmatic orthodoxies imposed upon these contents in the name of\norganized religion.\n\nThe central idea in Jaspers\u2019s philosophy of religion is the\nconcept of philosophical faith, set out most extensively in\nDer Philosophische Glaube (Philosophical Faith,\n1948) and Der Philophische Glaube angesichts der christlichen\nOffenbarung (Philosophical Faith in face of Christian\nRevelation, 1962). This notoriously difficult concept contains a\nnumber of quite distinct meanings. First, it means that true\nphilosophy must be guided by a faith in the originary transcendence of\nhuman existence, and that philosophy which negatively excludes or\nignores its transcendent origin falls short of the highest tasks of\nphilosophy. Second, however, it also means that true philosophy cannot\nsimply abandon philosophical rationality for positively disclosed\ntruth-contents or dogma, and that the critical function of rationality\nhas a constitutive role in the formation of absolute knowledge. In\nthis respect, Jaspers revisited some of the controversies concerning\nthe relation between religion and philosophy which shaped the\nphilosophy of the Young Hegelians in the 1830s. Like the Young\nHegelians, he insisted that faith needs philosophy, and faith devalues\nits contents wherever these are dogmatically or positively proclaimed.\nThird, then, this concept also indicates that the evidences of faith\nare always paradoxical and uncertain and that those who pursue\nknowledge of these contents must accept an attitude of philosophical\nrelativism and discursive exchange: if faith results in dogmatism, it\nimmediately undermines its claims to offer transcendent knowledge. The\nconcept of philosophical faith is thus proposed, not as a doctrine of\nfactual revelation or accomplished transcendence, but as a guide to\ntranscendent communication, which balances the element of disclosure\nin faith with a critical philosophical veto on the absolutism of\nreligious claims, and which consequently insists that transcendent\nknowledge must be accepted as relative and incomplete. In this regard,\nJaspers held the religious aspects of his philosophy on a fine\ndialectic between theological and anthropological assertions. He\nimplied, at one level, that purely secularist accounts of human life\nocclude existence against its originary transcendent possibilities and\nfreedoms. At the same time, however, he also suggested that pure\ntheological analysis closes humanity against the relativity and\nprecariousness of its truths, and against the communicative processes\nthrough which these truths are disclosed. Only philosophy which can at\nonce embrace and relativize secularism and embrace and relativize\nreligion is able to undertake adequate existential inquiry, and\nphilosophy which, in either direction, abandons the dialectical edge\nbetween these two commitments ceases to be genuine philosophy.\n\nThis critical-recuperative attitude towards religious inquiry was\nfundamental to many of the public controversies in which Jaspers\nengaged. The religious elements of his work came under attack from the\nCalvinist theologian, Karl Barth, who denounced the lack of objective\nreligious content in his concept of transcendence. More significantly,\nthough, Jaspers also entered into a lengthy and influential\ncontroversy with Rudolf Bultmann, the resonances of which still impact\non liberal theological debate. At the centre of this debate was\nJaspers\u2019s critique of Bultmann\u2019s strategy of scriptural\nde-mythologization: that is, his attempt to clarify the\ntruth-contents of the scriptures by eliminating the historical or\nmythological elements of the New Testament, and by concentrating, in\nan existentially intonated exegesis, on the perennially valid and\npresent aspects of the Bible. At the time when Bultmann first proposed\nthis de-mythologizing approach Jaspers was widely (although\nerroneously) identified with the liberal wing of Protestant theology,\nand it was perhaps expected that he might declare sympathy for\nBultmann\u2019s hermeneutical approach. Jaspers, however, turned\nsharply on Bultmann. He accused him, first, of propagating a false\nrationalism in religious debate; second, of arbitrarily dismissing the\nmanifestations, embedded in myth, of the spiritual experiences of\nthose living in earlier historical \u00e9poques; and, third, of\naligning all transcendent experiences to a standard scheme of relative\nvalue, and so of imposing a new system of orthodoxy in theology and\nundermining the manifold possibilities of transcendence. In opposition\nto Bultmann, therefore, Jaspers concluded that only a religious\nhermeneutic based in absolute liberality, excluding all\northodoxy, could be appropriate to the task of interpreting the\ntranscendent contents of human life. Interpretive methods which efface\nthe traces of historical contingency from transcendence and reduce\ntranscendence to one predetermined religious truth, he suggested, fail\nto reflect on the plural and various forms in which transcendence can\nbe interpreted, they erroneously presuppose that transcendence can be\nencased in the categories of one exclusive doctrine, and they\nundervalue the constitutive historical variability of transcendence.\nAs a consequence, Jaspers argued implicitly for the importance of\nmythical or symbolic forms in religious inquiry, and he indicated that\nboth myth and religion contain, in similar measure, the interpreted\nresidues of transcendence. His analysis of religion culminated in a\ndiscussion of Trinitarian theology which, echoing Ludwig\nFeuerbach\u2019s anthropological analysis, asserted that the three\nparts of the trinity should be interpreted, not as factual elements of\ndeity, but as symbolic ciphers of human possibility. In this, he\nascribed particular significance to the second person of the Trinity,\nJesus Christ, as a cipher for the human existential possibility of\ninner change, reversal and transformation. Wherever this cipher is\nhypostatically defined as mere positive fact of belief, he concluded\nhowever, the freedom of transcendence obtained through the sympathetic\ninterpretation and recuperation of this cipher is obstructed.\n\nUnderlying Jaspers\u2019s interest in religion was a determination to\nconvert the elements of religious doctrine into an account of human\npossibilities and freedoms. Indeed, the ambition behind his work on\nreligion and myth was no less than to liberate transcendence from\ntheology, and to permit an interpretive transformation of religiously\nconceived essences into the free moments of human self-interpretation.\nIf his thought can truly be placed in the terrain of theological\ndiscourse, therefore, his approach to religion is one of extreme\nliberalism and latitudinarianism, which dismisses the claim that\ntranscendence is exclusively or even predominantly disclosed by\nreligion. The truth of religion, he intimated, only becomes true if it\nis interpreted as a human truth, not as a truth originally external or\nprior to humanity. In its orthodox form, however, religion normally\nprevents the knowledge of transcendence which it purports to\noffer.\n6. Later Works: The Politics of Humanism\n\nThese humanistic reflections on the philosophy of religion are not\nisolated components of Jaspers\u2019s work. In fact, his criticism of\nreligious dogmatism evolved in conjunction with a wider doctrine of\nhumanism, which ultimately became the defining component of his later\nwork. Arguably, Jaspers was always a humanist; certainly, if humanism\nis defined as a doctrine which seeks to account for the specificity,\nuniqueness and dignity of human life his work can, from the outset, be\nseen as a variant on philosophical humanism. The argument runs through\nall his early works that human beings are distinguished by the fact\nthat they have authentic attributes of existence and\ntranscendence\u2014that is, by their ability to raise questions about\nthemselves and their freedoms which cannot be posed in material or\nscientific terms, and by their resultant capacity for decisive\nreversal, self-transformation and transcendence. True humanity is thus\na condition of free self-possession and transcendent authenticity. In\ngeneral terms, existentialism can be divided between philosophers,\nsuch as Jean-Paul Sartre, who defined existentialism as a humanism,\nand those, such as Heidegger, who saw the organization of philosophy\naround the analysis of human determinacy as a metaphysical corruption\nof philosophy. Jaspers clearly belonged to the first category of\nexistential philosophers.\n\nIn his writings after 1945, most especially in Vom\nUrsprung und Ziel der Geschichte (The Origin and Goal of\nHistory, 1949) and Die Atombombe und die Zukunft des\nMenschen (The Atom Bomb and the Future of Mankind,\n1961), Jaspers structured his work quite explicitly as a humanist\ndoctrine. From this time on, moreover, he attached greater importance\nto the social and collective conditions of human integrity and he\ntended to tone down his earlier construction of interiority as the\nplace of human freedom. In fact, even the term Existenz\nbecame increasingly scarce in his post-1945 publications, and it was\nreplaced, to a large extent, by ideas of shared humanity, founded, not\nin the decisive experiences of inner transformation, but in the\nresources of culture, tradition and ethically modulated political\nlife. Central to these later works, consequently, was not only a turn\ntowards humanistic reflection, but also an inquiry into the politics\nof humanism and the distinctively human preconditions of political\nexistence.\n\nBroadly reconstructed, in his later political work he argued that the\nemergence of European totalitarianism\u2014exemplified by both\nNational Socialism and Communism\u2014was the result of a decline in\npolitical humanity and of an increasing primacy of modes of technical\nor instrumental rationality, which erode the authentic resources of\nhuman life. He therefore sought to offer an account of a human polity,\nable to provide an enduring bastion against totalitarian inhumanity.\nFirst, he argued, the human polity must be sustained by an integral\ncultural tradition, so that human beings can interpret the ciphers of\ntheir integrity in the ethical contents of a national culture. The\npolitical betrayal of humanity, he suggested, is usually flanked by,\nand in fact presupposes, a cultural betrayal of humanity, and\ntotalitarian governance normally arises from the erosion or\ninstrumental subjection of culture. In the nineteenth century Marx had\nargued that the reactionary malaise of German politics was caused by\nthe fact that German society habitually allowed culture to stand in\nfor politics and defined the relatively de-politicized educated\nbourgeois elite [Bildungsb\u00fcrgertum] as the pillar of\nsocial order and the arbiter of progress. Jaspers responded to this\ncharacterization of Germany by claiming that societies which undermine\nthe cultural role of the bourgeois elite are inherently unstable, and\nthat the educated bourgeoisie has a primary role to play in upholding\nthe preconditions of democratic culture. Second, he argued that the\nhuman polity must be based in free communication between citizens:\ncommunicative freedom is a prerequisite of public virtue. The human\npolity, he thus implied, is likely to be some kind of democracy, based\nin some degree of publicly formed consensus. Like Arendt, in fact, he\nconcluded that social atomization creates cultures in which\ntotalitarianism is likely to flourish, and that only unregulated\ndebate in the public sphere can offset this latent pathology of mass\nsociety. Third, he argued that the resources of technological,\nscientific and economic planning employed by the political system\nshould be kept at a minimum, and that the existence of an unplanned\nsphere of human interaction is necessary for the maintenance of a\nhuman political order. In this respect, he fervently opposed all\ntendencies towards technocratic governance, which he identified both\nin the Communist bloc in Eastern Europe, and in the rapidly expanding\nwelfare state of the Federal Republic under Adenauer. Technocracy, he\nasserted, is the objective form of the instrumental tendencies in\nhuman reason, and if it is not counterbalanced by the integrally human\nresources of cultural or rational communication it is likely to result\nin oppressive government. In this respect, he moved close to quite\nstandard variants on political liberalism, and he endorsed limited\ngovernment, relative cultural and economic freedom, and protection for\nsociety from unaccountable political direction. Fourth, he also argued\nthat a human polity requires a constitutional apparatus, enshrining\nbasic rights, imposing moral-legal order on the operations of the\nstate, and restricting the prerogative powers of the political\napparatus. Like Kant, therefore, he advocated the institution of an\ninternational federation of states, with shared constitutions, laws\nand international courts. Fifth, however, he also retained aspects of\nthe elite-democratic outlook which he had first inherited from Weber,\nand he continued to argue that the human polity must be supported and\nguided by reasonable persons or responsible elites.\n\nAfter the traumas of National Socialism and the war, however, it is\nfair to say that Jaspers\u2019s political philosophy never moved\nfinally beyond a sceptical attitude towards pure democracy, and his\npolitical writings never fully renounced the sense that German society\nwas not sufficiently evolved to support a democracy, and Germans\nrequired education and guidance for democracy to take hold. Even in\nhis last writings of the 1960s, in which he declared tentative support\nfor the activities of the student movement around 1968, there remain\ntraces of elite-democratic sympathy. For all his importance in modern\nGerman politics, therefore, his philosophy of politics was always\nslightly anachronistic, and his position remained embedded in the\npersonalistic ideals of statehood which characterized the old-liberal\npolitical culture of Imperial Germany and persisted in the\nconservative-liberal fringes of the Weimar Republic.\n\nJaspers left unfinished Die Gro\u00dfen Philosophen, whose\ndeclared aim was \u201cpromoting the happiness that comes of meeting\ngreat men and sharing in their thoughts\u201d, and employed his\npersonal method of constant questioning and struggle. This is a\nmonumental project of universal history of philosophy, whose creators\nwere the outstanding philosophers who inspired the human thought.\nJaspers, who believed that only through communication with others can\nwe come to ourselves and to wisdom, regarded the philosophers he\ndiscusses in this book as his \u201ceternal contemporaries\u201d and\n\u201cthe disturbers\u201d in the sense of thinkers for whom doubt\nand despair loomed large. The first two volumes of this work appeared\nin 1958, while the third and fourth have been gathered from the vast\nmaterial of his posthumous papers. The editors Ermarth and Ehrlich\nhave, however, been able to stitch together a coherent book that, in\naccordance with Jaspers\u2019s plan, primarily covers the\nphilosophers whom he termed \u201cthe disturbers\u201d: thinkers for\nwhom doubt and despair loomed large. The English translations were by\nRalf Manheim and edited by Hannah Arendt, and appeared in parts until\n1994.\n7. Commentary and Edition of the complete works (KJG)\n\nThe Heidelberg Academy (\u201cHeidelberger Forum Edition\u201d) and\nthe academy of sciences in G\u00f6ttingen initiated a project of\ngathering in one standard edition the unconnected variety of\ndistinguished editions, commentaries, and translations of the writings\nof Karl Jaspers. The project is chaired by Otfried H\u00f6ffe,\ntogether with the editors Thomas Fuchs, Jens Halfwassen, and Reinhard\nSchulz, with the cooperation of Anton H\u00fcgli, Kurt Salamun, und\nHans Saner. The planned project consists of three major divisions,\naltogether comprising 50 volumes: works (I. 1\u201327), estate (II.\n1\u201311), and letters (III. 1\u201312). While the first division\ncovers all the works that were printed and published during\nJaspers\u2019s lifetime, the second and the third encompass\nselections from the vast material of his posthumous papers, some\nalready published and others that have never appeared. The set\u2019s\ngeneral objective is reviving the investigation of the philosophical,\ncontemporary, and cultural preconditions for Jaspers\u2019s thinking,\nand also tracing the history of his impact. The work on this edition\nat the Universities of Heidelberg and Oldenburg is projected to take\n18 years and is the fruit of cooperation with the Karl Jaspers\nFoundation in Basel. The editors will have recourse to the unpublished\nwritings kept at the German Literary Archives in Marbach and the\n11,000 volumes of the Jaspers Research Library in the future Karl\nJaspers House in Oldenburg. Over and above the commentary itself, the\nedition is designed to provide new impulses for research on the\nphilosopher and to enable the debates on present-day cultural and\npolitical issues to profit from a species of thinking that can be\ndescribed as interdisciplinary and cosmopolitan in the best sense of\nthose terms.
