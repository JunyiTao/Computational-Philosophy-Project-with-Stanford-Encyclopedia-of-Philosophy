    "main_text": "The Fathers of the Church\n3. The Fathers of the Church\n\nThe Christian theologians of late antiquity are referred to as the\nFathers of the\n Church.[7]\n The most influential of them in medieval Europe was Augustine; others\nincluded Cyprian, Ambrose and Gregory. The Greek Fathers (Origen,\nChrysostom, etc.) were not so influential at first, but during the\nscholastic period many of their writings were translated into\n Latin.[8]\n The Fathers were influential partly through their originalia\n(i.e., their original writings in their complete text), but perhaps\nmore through extracts included in \u201cglosses\u201d on the Bible\nand in anthologies and through extensive quotations made by later\nwriters. Many of the Fathers were influenced by the Platonism and\n Stoicism\n that every educated person became acquainted with in the ancient\nworld. Augustine was particularly influenced by Platonism, in the\nversion modern scholars call\n Neoplatonism,\n and by\n Plotinus\n especially.\n\nThe Fathers passed down to the middle ages the idea that certain key\nsocial institutions were not part of God\u2019s original plan for\nmankind, namely the institutions of coercive government, slavery and\nproperty. The idea found in\n Seneca\n and other ancient Stoics of a Golden Age had a parallel in Christian\nthinking, namely the age of innocence in the Garden of Eden, from\nwhich mankind were expelled because of the sin of Adam and Eve (the\n \u201cFall\u201d).[9]\n Just as Seneca ([c. 60 CE] 1917\u201325: vol. II, 397,\nLetter 90) held that originally there would have been no need\nfor coercion, since human beings would voluntarily have accepted the\nguidance of the wise, and no need for property, since no one would\nhave sought to control more resources than they needed to support a\ntemperate way of life, and no slavery, since a slave is a human being\ntreated as property, so, according to the Fathers, these institutions\nwould not have existed if Adam had not sinned. But because of sin they\ndo exist, both as a result of sinfulness (the power-hungry and greedy\namass coercive power and property), and as a necessary and justified\nremedy for sin\u2014ideally, governments should use coercion to\nrepress wrongdoing, with slavery used only as a punishment, milder\nthan execution, for wrongdoing, and property should be of moderate\nextent, its purpose being to protect possession of necessities from\nthe greed of those who would otherwise try to control everything.\n\nThe common opinion on coercive government and slavery was expressed by\nAugustine. God \n\n\ndid not intend that \u2026[man] should have lordship over any but\nirrational creatures: not man over man, but man over the beasts.\nHence, the first just men were established as shepherds of flocks,\nrather than as kings of men. (City of God, XIX.15, p. 942;\npage references are to the translation by Dyson [1998]) \n\n\nHe goes on to say that slavery is a just punishment for sin, and that\nservi are so called because \u201cthose who might [justly]\nhave been slain under the laws of war were sometimes spared\u201d\n[servabantur].\n\nOn property, Gratian\u2019s Decretum (c. 1140) included a\npassage from Ambrose: \n\n\nBut he says, \u2018Why is it unjust if I diligently look after my own\nthings as long as I do not seize other people\u2019s? O impudent\nwords! \u2026 No one should say \u2018my own\u2019 of what is\ncommon; if more than what suffices is taken, it is obtained with\nviolence. Who is as unjust and as avaricious, as he who makes the food\n[alimenta] of the multitude not for his own use, but for his\nabundance and luxuries? The bread which you hold back belongs to the\nneedy. (D. 47 c. 8; Tierney 1959: 34) \n\n\nThus even now that property exists, things are in some sense\n\u201ccommon\u201d, and the amount of property individuals may\nlegitimately keep for their own use is limited.\n",
