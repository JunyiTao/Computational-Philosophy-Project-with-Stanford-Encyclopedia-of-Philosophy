    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Dewey (1859\u20131952) lived from the Civil War to the Cold War,\na period of extraordinary social, economic, demographic, political and\ntechnological change. During his lifetime the United States changed\nfrom a rural to an urban society, from an agricultural to an\nindustrial economy, from a regional to a world power. It absorbed\nmillions of immigrants from Europe and Asia, but faced wrenching\nconflicts between capital and labor as they were integrated into the\nurban industrial economy. As the face-to-face communal life of small\nvillages and towns waned, it confronted the need to create new forms\nof community life capable of sustaining democracy on urban and\nnational scales. Dewey believed that neither traditional moral norms\nnor traditional philosophical ethics were able to cope with the\nproblems raised by these dramatic transformations. Traditional\nmorality was adapted to conditions that no longer existed. Hidebound\nand unreflective, it was incapable of changing to address the problems\nraised by new circumstances. Traditional philosophical ethics sought\nto discover and justify fixed moral goals and principles by dogmatic\nmethods. Its preoccupation with reducing the diverse sources of moral\ninsight to a single fixed principle subordinated practical service to\nordinary people to the futile search for certainty, stability, and\nsimplicity. In practice, both traditional morality and philosophical\nethics served the interests of elites at the expense of most people.\nTo address the problems raised by social change, moral practice needed\nto acquire the disposition to respond intelligently to new\ncircumstances. Dewey saw his reconstruction of philosophical ethics as\na means to effect this practical reconstruction.\n\nDewey\u2019s ethics replaces the goal of identifying an ultimate end\nor supreme ethical principle with the goal of identifying a method for\nimproving our value judgments. Dewey argued that ethical inquiry is\nthe use of reflective intelligence to revise our judgments in light of\nthe consequences of acting on them. Value judgments are tools for\nsatisfactorily redirecting conduct when habits fail. As tools, they\ncan be evaluated instrumentally. We test our value judgments by\nputting them into practice and seeing whether the results are\nsatisfactory \u2014 whether they solve our problems with acceptable\nside-effects, whether they enable successful responses to novel\nproblems, whether living in accordance with alternative value\njudgments yields more satisfactory results. We make moral progress by\nadopting habits of reflectively revising our value judgments in\nresponse to the widest consequences for everyone of following them.\nThe conditions of warrant for value judgments lie in human conduct,\nnot in any a priori fixed reference point outside of conduct,\nsuch as God\u2019s commands, Platonic Forms, pure reason, or nature.\nDewey offers a naturalistic metaethic of value judgments, grounded in\ndevelopmental and social psychology.\n",
