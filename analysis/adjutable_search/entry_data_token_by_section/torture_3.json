    "main_text": "The Moral Justification for One-off Acts of Torture in Emergencies || Case Study \u2013 The Beating\n3.1 Case Study \u2013 The Beating\n\nConsider the following case study:\n\n\n\nHeight of the antipodean summer, Mercury at the century-mark; the\nnoonday sun softened the bitumen beneath the tyres of her little\nHyundai sedan to the consistency of putty. Her three year old son,\nquiet at last, snuffled in his sleep on the back seat. He had a summer\ncold and wailed like a banshee in the supermarket, forcing her to cut\nshort her shopping. Her car needed petrol. Her tot was asleep on the\nback seat. She poured twenty litres into the tank; thumbing notes from\nher purse, harried and distracted, her keys dangled from the\nignition.\n\nWhilst she was in the service station a man drove off in her car.\nPolice wound back the service station\u2019s closed-circuit TV\ncamera, saw what appeared to be a heavy set Pacific Islander with a\nblonde-streaked Afro entering her car. \u201cDon\u2019t\npanic\u201d, a police constable advised the mother, \u201cas soon as\nhe sees your little boy in the back he will abandon the car.\u201d He\ndid; police arrived at the railway station before the car thief did\nand arrested him after a struggle when he vaulted over the station\nbarrier.\n\nIn the police truck on the way to the police station: \u201cWhere did\nyou leave the Hyundai?\u201d Denial instead of dissimulation:\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d It was \u2013 property stolen from\nthe car was found in his pockets. In the detectives\u2019 office:\n\u201cIt\u2019s been twenty minutes since you took the\ncar \u2013 little tin box like that car \u2013 It will heat up like an\noven under this sun. Another twenty minutes and the child\u2019s dead\nor brain damaged. Where did you dump the car?\u201d Again: \u201cIt\nwasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\nAppeals to decency, to reason, to self-interest: \u201cIt\u2019s not\ntoo late; tell us where you left the car and you will only be charged\nwith Take-and-Use. That\u2019s just a six month extension of your\nrecognizance.\u201d Threats: \u201cIf the child dies I will charge\nyou with Manslaughter!\u201d Sneering, defiant and belligerent; he\nmade no secret of his contempt for the police. Part-way through his\numpteenth, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me\u201d, a questioner clipped him\nacross the ear as if he were a child, an insult calculated to bring\nthe Islander to his feet to fight, there a body-punch elicited a roar\nof pain, but he fought back until he lapsed into semi-consciousness\nunder a rain of blows. He quite enjoyed handing out a bit of biffo,\nbut now, kneeling on hands and knees in his own urine, in pain he had\nnever known, he finally realised the beating would go on until he told\nthe police where he had abandoned the child and the car.\n\nThe police officers\u2019 statements in the prosecution brief made no\nmention of the beating; the location of the stolen vehicle and the\ninfant inside it was portrayed as having been volunteered by the\ndefendant. The defendant\u2019s counsel availed himself of this\nfalsehood in his plea in mitigation. When found, the stolen child was\ndehydrated, too weak to cry; there were ice packs and dehydration in\nthe casualty ward but no long-time prognosis on brain damage.\n\n(Case Study provided by John Blackler, a former New South Wales police\nofficer.)\n\n\nIn this case study torture of the car thief can be provided with a\nsubstantial moral justification, even if it does not convince\neveryone. Consider the following points: (1) The police reasonably\nbelieve that torturing the car thief will probably save an innocent\nlife; (2) the police know that there is no other way to save the life;\n(3) the threat to life is more or less imminent; (4) the baby is\ninnocent; (5) the car thief is known not to be an innocent \u2013 his\naction is known to have caused the threat to the baby, and he is\nrefusing to allow the baby\u2019s life to be saved.\n\nThe classic, indeed clich\u00e9, example used to justify torture is\nthat of the so-called \u2018ticking\n bomb\u2019.[13]\n (See Bufacchi & Arrigo 2006, Kleinig 2006, Hill 2007, Kaufman\n2008, Segev 2008, Wisnewski 2009 and Steinhoff 2013.)
