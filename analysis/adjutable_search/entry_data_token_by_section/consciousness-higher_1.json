    "main_text": "The Motivation for a Higher-Order Approach\n2. The Motivation for a Higher-Order Approach\n\nHigher-order theories, like cognitive/representational theories in\ngeneral, assume that the right level at which to seek an\nexplanation of phenomenal consciousness is a cognitive one, providing\nan explanation in terms of some combination of causal role\nand intentional content. All such theories claim that\nphenomenal consciousness consists in a certain kind of intentional or\nrepresentational content (analog or\n\u2018fine-grained\u2019 in comparison with any concepts we possess)\nfiguring in a certain distinctive position in the causal architecture\nof the mind. They must therefore maintain that these latter sorts of\nmental property don\u2019t already implicate or presuppose phenomenal\nconsciousness. In fact, all cognitive accounts are united in rejecting\nthe thesis that the very properties of mind or\nmentality already presuppose phenomenal consciousness, as\nproposed by Searle (1992, 1997) for example. The higher-order approach\ndoes not attempt to reduce consciousness directly to neurophysiology\nbut rather its reduction is in mentalistic terms, that is, by using\nsuch notions as thoughts and awareness.\n\nThe major divide amongst representational theories of phenomenal\nconsciousness in general, is between accounts that are provided in\npurely first-order terms and those that implicate higher-order\nrepresentations of one sort or another (see below). These higher-order\ntheorists will allow that first-order accounts\u2014of the sort\ndefended by Dretske (1995) and Tye (1995), for example\u2014can\nalready make some progress with the problem of consciousness.\nAccording to first-order views, phenomenal consciousness consists in\nanalog or fine-grained contents that are available to the first-order\nprocesses that guide thought and action. So a phenomenally-conscious\npercept of red, for example, consists in a state with the analog\ncontent red which is tokened in such a way as to feed into\nthoughts about red, or into actions that are in one way or another\nguided by redness. Now, the point to note in favor of such an account\nis that it can explain the natural temptation to think that phenomenal\nconsciousness is in some sense ineffable, or\nindescribable. This will be because such states have\nfine-grained contents that can slip through the mesh of any conceptual\nnet. We can always distinguish many more shades of red than we have\nconcepts for, or could describe in language (other than\nindexically\u2014e.g., \u2018That shade\u2019).\n\nThe main motivation behind higher-order theories of consciousness, in\ncontrast, derives from the belief that all (or at least most)\nmental-state types admit of both conscious and unconscious varieties.\nAlmost everyone now accepts, for example, (post-Freud) that beliefs\nand desires can be activated unconsciously. (Think, here, of the way\nin which problems can apparently become resolved during sleep, or\nwhile one\u2019s attention is directed to other tasks. Notice, too, that\nappeals to unconscious intentional states are now routine in cognitive\nscience.) And then if we ask what makes the difference between a\nconscious and an unconscious mental state, one natural answer is that\nconscious states are states that we are aware of. And if\nawareness is thought to be a form of creature-consciousness\n(see section 1 above), then this will translate into the view that\nconscious states are states of which the subject is aware, or\nstates of which the subject is creature-conscious. That is to say,\nthese are states that are the objects of some sort of higher-order\nrepresentation\u2014whether a higher-order perception or experience,\nor a higher-order thought. This is similar to the widely referenced\nTransitivity Principle (TP) which says that a conscious state is a\nstate whose subject is, in some way, aware of being in it. On the\nother hand, a mental state of which a subject is\ncompletely unaware is clearly an unconscious state. (See also\nLycan\u2019s (2001b)\u2018related simple argument\u2019 for a\nhigher-order representation account of consciousness.)\n\nOne crucial question, then, is whether perceptual states as well as\nintentional states admit of both conscious and unconscious varieties. Can there\nbe, for example, such a thing as an unconscious visual perceptual\nstate? Higher-order theorists are united in thinking that there can.\nArmstrong (1968) uses the example of absent-minded driving to make the\npoint. Most of us at some time have had the rather unnerving\nexperience of \u2018coming to\u2019 after having been driving on\n\u2018automatic pilot\u2019 while our attention was directed\nelsewhere\u2014perhaps having been day-dreaming or engaged in intense\nconversation with a passenger. We were apparently not consciously\naware of much of the route we have recently taken, nor of any of the\nobstacles we avoided on the way. Yet we must surely have been\nseeing, or we would have crashed the car. Others have used\nthe example of blindsight (Carruthers 1989, 1996). This is a condition\nin which subjects have had a portion of their primary visual cortex\ndestroyed, and apparently become blind in a region of their visual\nfield as a result. But it has now been known for some time that if\nsubjects are asked to guess at the properties of their\n\u2018blind\u2019 field (e.g. whether it contains a horizontal or\nvertical grating, or whether it contains an \u2018X\u2019 or an\n\u2018O\u2019), they prove remarkably accurate. Subjects can also\nreach out and grasp objects in their \u2018blind\u2019 field with\nsomething like 80% or more of normal accuracy, and can catch a ball\nthrown from their \u2018blind\u2019 side, all without conscious\nawareness. (See Weiskrantz 1986, 1997, for details and\ndiscussion.)\n\nA powerful case for the existence of unconscious visual\nexperience has also been generated by the two-systems theory of\nvision proposed and defended by Milner and Goodale (1995; see also\nJacob and Jeannerod 2003; Glover 2004). They review a wide variety of\nkinds of neurological and neuro-psychological evidence for the\nsubstantial independence of two distinct visual systems, instantiated\nin the temporal and parietal lobes respectively. They conclude that\nthe parietal lobes provide a set of specialized semi-independent\nmodules for the on-line visual control of action; whereas the temporal\nlobes are primarily concerned with more off-line functions such as\nvisual learning and object recognition. And only the perceptions\ngenerated by the temporal-lobe system are phenomenally conscious, on\ntheir account. (Note that this isn\u2019t the familiar distinction between what\nand where visual systems, but is rather a successor to it.\nFor the temporal-lobe system is supposed to have access both to\nproperty information and to spatial information. Instead, it is a\ndistinction between a combined what-where system located in\nthe temporal lobes and a how-to or action-guiding system\nlocated in the parietal lobes.)\n\nTo get the flavor of Milner and Goodale\u2019s hypothesis, consider just\none strand from the wealth of evidence that they provide. This is a\nneurological syndrome called visual form agnosia, which\nresults from damage localized to both temporal lobes, leaving primary\nvisual cortex and the parietal lobes intact. (Visual form agnosia is\nnormally caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, for reasons that are\nlittle understood.) Such patients cannot recognize objects or shapes,\nand may be capable of little conscious visual experience; but their\nsensorimotor abilities remain largely intact.\n\nOne particular patient\u2014D.F.\u2014has now been examined in\nconsiderable detail. While D.F. is severely agnosic, she isn\u2019t\ncompletely lacking in conscious visual experience. Her capacities to\nperceive colors and textures are almost completely preserved. (Why\njust these sub-modules in her temporal cortex should have been spared\nisn\u2019t known.) As a result, she can sometimes guess the identity of a\npresented object\u2014recognizing a banana, say, from its yellow\ncolor and the distinctive texture of its surface. But she is unable to\nperceive the shape of the banana (whether straight or curved, say);\nnor its orientation (upright or horizontal; pointing towards her or\nacross). Yet many of her sensorimotor abilities are close to\nnormal\u2014she would be able to reach out and grasp the banana,\norienting her hand and wrist appropriately for its position and\norientation, and using a normal and appropriate finger grip. Under\nexperimental conditions it turns out that although D.F. is at chance\nwhen identifying the orientation of a broad line or letter-box, she is\nalmost normal when posting a letter through a similarly-shaped slot\noriented at random angles. In the same way, although she is at chance\nwhen trying to discriminate between rectangular blocks of very\ndifferent sizes, her reaching and grasping behaviors when asked to\npick up such a block are virtually indistinguishable from those of\nnormal controls. It is very hard to make sense of these data without\nsupposing that the sensorimotor perceptual system is functionally and\nanatomically distinct from the object-recognition/conscious\nsystem.\n\nBut what implications does this have for phenomenal consciousness?\nMust these unconscious percepts also be lacking in phenomenal\nproperties? Most people think so. While it may be possible to get\noneself to believe that the perceptions of the absent-minded car\ndriver can remain phenomenally conscious (perhaps lying outside of the\nfocus of attention, or being instantly forgotten), it is very hard to\nbelieve that either blindsight percepts or D.F.\u2019s sensorimotor\nperceptual states might be phenomenally conscious ones. For these\nperceptions are ones to which the subjects of those states are\nblind, and of which they cannot be aware. And the\nquestion, then, is what makes the relevant difference? What is it\nabout a conscious perception that renders it phenomenal, that\na blindsight perceptual state would correspondingly lack? Higher-order\ntheorists are united in thinking that the relevant difference consists\nin the presence of something higher-order in the first case\nthat is absent in the second. The same would go for the difference\nbetween unconscious and conscious desires, emotions, pains, and so\non. The core intuition, again, is that a phenomenally conscious state\nwill be a state of which the subject is aware.\n\nWhat options does a first-order theorist have to resist this\nconclusion? One is to deny that the data are as problematic as they\nappear (as does Dretske 1995). It can be said that the unconscious\nstates in question lack the kind of fineness of grain and richness of\ncontent necessary to count as genuinely perceptual states. On\nthis view, the contrast discussed above isn\u2019t really a difference\nbetween conscious and unconscious perceptions, but rather between\nconscious perceptions, on the one hand, and unconscious belief-like\nstates, on the other. Another option is to accept the distinction\nbetween conscious and unconscious perceptions, and then to explain\nthat distinction in first-order terms. It might be said, for example,\nthat conscious perceptions are those that are available to\nbelief and thought, whereas unconscious ones are\nthose that are available to guide movement (Kirk 1994). A\nfinal option is to bite the bullet, and insist that blindsight and\nsensorimotor perceptual states are indeed phenomenally conscious while\nnot being access-conscious. (See Block 1995; Tye 1995; and\nNelkin 1996; all of whom defend versions of this view.) On this\naccount, blindsight percepts are phenomenally conscious states to\nwhich the subjects of those states are blind. Higher-order theorists\nwill argue, of course, that none of these alternatives is acceptable\n(see, e.g., Carruthers 2000; Rosenthal 2005).\n\nFurther, Lau and Rosenthal (2011) survey the empirical evidence\npertaining to the difference between higher-order theories and\nfirst-order ones. While much is equivocal, and many questions are left\nunanswered, they point to a pair of studies that support a\nhigher-order account. One is Lau and Passingham (2006), who are able\nto demonstrate using carefully controlled stimuli that there are\ncircumstances in which people\u2019s subjective reports of visual\nexperience are impaired while their first-order discrimination\nabilities remain fully intact. They also find that visual\nconsciousness in these conditions is specifically associated with\nactivity in a region of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Then in a\nfollow-up study Rounis et al. (2010) find that transcranial magnetic\nstimulation directed at this region of cortex, thereby disrupting its\nactivity, also has a significant impact on people\u2019s meta-visual\nawareness, but again without impairing first-order task\nperformance. The degree to which the prefrontal cortex\nis required for having a conscious state and the view that\nthe prefrontal cortex is the likely site of all higher-order\nthoughts are also the subject of vigorous continuing debate (Block\n1995; Gennaro 2012, chapter nine; Kozuch 2014; Odegaard, Knight, and\nLau 2017). \n\nMost generally, then, higher-order theories of phenomenal consciousness\nclaim the following:\n\nHigher Order Theory (In General):\n\nA phenomenally conscious mental state is a mental state (of a certain\nsort\u2014see below) that either is, or is disposed to be, the object\nof a higher-order representation of a certain sort (see below).\n\n\nHigher-order theorists do agree that one must normally become aware of\nthe lower-order state non-inferentially since mental states\ncan sometimes become targets of higher-order representation via\nconscious inference without being phenomenally conscious. For example,\nif I become aware of my unconscious desire to kill my boss because I\nhave consciously inferred it from a session with my psychiatrist, then\nthe characteristic phenomenal feel of such a conscious desire may be\nabsent. \n\nStill, there are then two main dimensions along which higher-order\ntheorists disagree amongst themselves. One concerns whether the\nhigher-order states in question are perception-like, on the one hand,\nor thought-like, on the other. A thought is composed of or constituted\nby concepts. Those taking the former option are\nhigher-order perception (often called\n\u2018inner-sense\u2019) theorists, and those taking the latter\noption are higher-order thought theorists. The two theories\nare therefore often abbreviated as HOP (higher-order perception) and\nHOT (higher-order thought) theory. The other general disagreement is\ninternal to higher-order thought approaches, and concerns whether the\nrelevant relation between the first-order state and the higher-order\nthought is one of availability or not.  That is, the question\nis whether a state is conscious by virtue of being disposed\nto give rise to a higher-order thought, or rather by virtue of being\nthe actual target of such a thought. These are the three main\noptions that will now concern us. (A fourth will be considered in\nsection 6.)\n",
