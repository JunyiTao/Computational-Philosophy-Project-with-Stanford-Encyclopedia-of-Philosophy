    "main_text": "The Limits of Cognitive Success || Responses to the Defeasibility Argument\n6.5 Responses to the Epistemic Possibility Argument\n\nThe most common reply to\n BEPA\n is either to deny premise (1), or to deny that we are justified in\nbelieving that premise (1) is true. Most writers would deny premise\n(1), and would do so on whatever grounds they have for thinking that I\ncan know that I\u2019m not a BIV: knowing that something is not the\ncase excludes that thing\u2019s being epistemically possible for\n you.[66]\n\nBut a couple of influential writers\u2014most notably Rogers\nAlbritton and Thompson Clarke (see Albritton 2011 and Clarke\n1972)\u2014do not claim that premise (1) is false. Rather, they deny\nthat we are justified in believing that premise (1) is true. According\nto these writers, what normally justifies us in believing that\nsomething or other is epistemically possible is that we can conceive\nof discovering that it is true. For instance, what justifies\nme in believing, say, that it\u2019s possible that Donald Trump has\nresigned is that I can clearly conceive of discovering that\nDonald Trump has resigned. But if I attempt to conceive of discovering\nthat I\u2019m a BIV, it\u2019s not clear that I can succeed in this\nattempt. I may conceive of coming upon some evidence that I\u2019m a\nBIV\u2014but, insofar as this evidence tells in favor of the\nhypothesis that I\u2019m a BIV, doesn\u2019t it also undermine its\nown credibility? In such a case, is there anything at all that would\ncount as \u201cmy evidence\u201d? (see Neta forthcoming for an\nelaboration of this point). Without being able to answer this question\nin the affirmative, it\u2019s not clear that I can conceive of\nanything that would amount to discovering that I\u2019m a BIV. Of\ncourse, from the fact that I cannot conceive of anything that would\namount to discovering that I\u2019m a BIV, it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat I\u2019m not a BIV\u2014and so it doesn\u2019t even follow\nthat it\u2019s not possible that I\u2019m a BIV. But, whether or not\nit is possible that I\u2019m a BIV, I can\u2019t be\njustified in thinking that it is. And that\u2019s to say that I\ncan\u2019t be justified in accepting premise (1) of BEPA.\n",
