    "main_text": "Preliminaries || The School and its History\n1.1 The School and its History\n\nThe Stoic school was founded around 300 BCE by Zeno of Citium, a\nvoracious reader of Socratic dialogues, who also studied under the\nCynic Crates and was influenced by the teachings of Plato\u2019s\nAcademy and the Megarian School. The Stoa competed with the school\nfounded only a little before in Athens by Epicurus, and Stoic and\nEpicurean views are often compared and contrasted. Zeno was succeeded\nin the leadership of the Stoa first by Cleanthes of Assos and then by\nChrysippus of Soli, who headed the school from around 230 until 206\nBCE and was by all accounts its foremost theorist and systematizer.\nFollowing Chrysippus, the position of \u201cscholarch\u201d passed\nto his former students, the last of which being Diogenes of Babylon in\nthe middle of the 2nd century BCE.\n\nSome scholars see this moment as marking a shift in the Stoic school,\nfrom the so-called \u201cOld Stoa\u201d to \u201cMiddle\nStoicism\u201d, though the relevance and accuracy of this\nnomenclature is debated (see Inwood 2022). The latter term is\nnonetheless frequently used to encompass the work of Stoic\nphilosophers in the second and first centuries BCE. A significant\nfeature of the second century is the sharp and powerful attacks\nagainst Stoic views formulated by the Academic\n Carneades,\n to which Antipater of Tarsus, Diogenes\u2019 successor, responded at\nlength. Diogenes and Antipater also heralded increased engagement with\nPlatonic (Sedley 2003; Reydams-Schils 1999) and possibly Aristotelian\ndoctrine, arguably peaking with Panaetius in the second half of 2nd\ncentury BCE and his student Posidonius in the first century BCE. For\ndevelopments from Antipater onwards, see Inwood 2022; for the\ncontributions of Panaetius and Posidonius and their relation to\nprevious thinkers, see Tieleman 2007.\n\nStoicism became particularly fashionable in the Roman period. Although\nnever identifying as a Stoic himself,\n Cicero,\n who studied philosophy in Athens and endeavored to popularize it at\nRome, engaged extensively with Stoic theory in his philosophical works\nand modeled his On Proper Functions (De Officiis) on\nPanaetius\u2019 treatise of the same name. During the Imperial era,\nseveral prominent public figures were associated with the Stoic\nschool. Appointed to the court of Emperor Augustus in the late 1st\ncentury BCE was the Stoic philosopher Arius Didymus, and a generation\nlater\n Seneca\n served as advisor to Nero.\n Epictetus,\n a former slave, was expelled from Rome by Domitian along with other\nphilosophers in 93 CE, and his works, recorded by his student Arrian,\nheavily influenced\n Marcus Aurelius,\n Roman Emperor from 161\u2013180 CE. Also active in the second\ncentury CE was the Stoic philosopher Hierocles, whose detailed\ntreatise on psychology and ethical theory, The Elements of\nEthics, is partially extant (see Ramelli 2009).\n\nOver this remarkable span of time during which the Stoic school\noperated in some form or another, evolutions in views and shifts in\nfocus unsurprisingly took place. The nature and extent of these\nintra-school developments and disagreements \u2013 some of which we\nwill consider below \u2013 remains the subject of ongoing scholarly\ndebate.\n",
