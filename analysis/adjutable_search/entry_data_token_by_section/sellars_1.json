The Philosophical Enterprise and the Images of Humanity-in-the-World\nIn \u201cPhilosophy and the Scientific Image of Man\u201d [PSIM],\nSellars lays out his view of philosophy and its current situation.\n\u201cThe aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand\nhow things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in\nthe broadest possible sense of the term\u201d (PSIM, in SPR:1; in\nISR: 369).  \u201cTo achieve success in philosophy would be, to use a\ncontemporary turn of phrase, to \u2018know one\u2019s way\naround\u2019 \u2026, not in that unreflective way in which the\ncentipede of the story knew its way around before it faced the\nquestion, \u2018how do I walk?\u2019, but in that reflective way\nwhich means that no intellectual holds are barred\u201d\n(loc. cit.). Thus, philosophy is a reflectively conducted higher-order\ninquiry that is continuous with but distinguishable from any of the\nspecial disciplines, and the understanding it aims at must\nhave practical force, guiding our activities, both theoretical\nand practical.\nPSIM describes what Sellars sees as the major problem confronting\nphilosophy today.  This is the \u201cclash\u201d between \u201cthe\n\u2018manifest\u2019 image of man-in-the-world\u201d and \u201cthe\nscientific image.\u201d These two \u2018images\u2019 are\nidealizations of distinct conceptual frameworks in terms of which\nhumans conceive of the world and their place in it.  Sellars\ncharacterizes the manifest image as \u201cthe framework in terms of\nwhich man came to be aware of himself as man-in-the-world\u201d\n(PSIM, in SPR: 6; in ISR: 374), but it is, more broadly, the framework\nin terms of which we ordinarily observe and explain our world.  The\nfundamental objects of the manifest image are persons and things, with\nemphasis on persons, which puts normativity and reason at\ncenter stage.  According to the manifest image, people think\nand they do things for reasons, and both of these \u201ccan occur\nonly within a framework of conceptual thinking in terms of which\n[they] can be criticized, supported, refuted, in short,\nevaluated\u201d (PSIM, in SPR: 6; in ISR: 374).  In the manifest\nimage persons are very different from mere things; things do not act rationally, in accordance with normative rules, but only in accord with laws or perhaps habits. How and why\nnormative concepts and assessments apply to things is an important and contentious\nquestion within the framework. \nThe manifest image is not fixed or static; it can be refined both\nempirically and categorically.  Empirical refinement by\ncorrelational induction results in ever better observation-level\ngeneralizations about the world.  Categorial refinement consists in\nadding, subtracting, or reconceptualizing the basic objects recognized\nin the image, e.g., worrying about whether persons are best thought of\nin hylomorphic or dualistic categories or how things differ from\npersons.  Thus, the manifest image is neither unscientific nor\nanti-scientific.  It is, however, methodologically more promiscuous\nand often less rigorous than institutionalized science. Traditional\nphilosophy, philosophia perennis, endorses the manifest image\nas real and attempts to understand its structure. \nOne kind of categorial change, however, is excluded from the\nmanifest image by stipulation: the addition to the framework of new\nconcepts of basic objects by means of theoretical postulation.  This\nis the move Sellars stipulates to be definitive of the scientific\nimage.  Science, by postulating new kinds of basic entities (e.g.,\nsubatomic particles, fields, collapsing packets of probability waves),\nslowly constructs a new framework that claims to be a\ncomplete description and explanation of the world and its processes.\nThe scientific image grows out of and is methodologically posterior to\nthe manifest image, which provides the initial framework in which\nscience is nurtured, but Sellars claims that \u201cthe scientific\nimage presents itself as a rival image.  From its point of view\nthe manifest image on which it rests is an \u2018inadequate\u2019\nbut pragmatically useful likeness of a reality which first finds its\nadequate (in principle) likeness in the scientific image\u201d (PSIM,\nin SPR: 20; in ISR: 388). \nIs it possible to reconcile these two images?  Could manifest\nobjects reduce to systems of imperceptible scientific objects?\nAre manifest objects ultimately real, scientific objects merely\nabstract constructions valuable for the prediction and control of\nmanifest objects?  Or are manifest objects appearances to human minds\nof a reality constituted by systems of imperceptible particles or something even more basic, such as absolute processes (see FMPP)?\nSellars opts for the third alternative.  The manifest image is, in his\nview, a phenomenal realm \u00e0 la Kant, but science, at its\nPeircean ideal conclusion, reveals things as they are in themselves.\nDespite what Sellars calls \u201cthe primacy of the\nscientific image\u201d (PSIM, in SPR: 32; in ISR: 400), he ultimately\nargues for a \u201csynoptic vision\u201d in which the descriptive\nand explanatory resources of the scientific image are united with the\n\u201clanguage of community and individual intentions,\u201d which\n\u201cprovide[s] the ambience of principles and standards (above all,\nthose which make meaningful discourse and rationality itself possible)\nwithin which we live our own individual lives\u201d (PSIM, in SPR:\n40; in ISR: 408). \nNorms are not reduced away in Sellars\u2019s naturalism; he\naccommodates normativity, not as a basic, ontologically independent\nfeature of the world, but rather as a conceptually irreducible,\nindispensable aspect of distinctively human activity grounded in the\ncollective institution of principles and standards.  We will return to\nthe question of norms later in this article.\nSellars boldly proclaims that \u201cin the dimension of describing\nand explaining the world, science is the measure of all things, of\nwhat is that it is, and of what is not that it is not\u201d (EPM\n\u00a741; in SPR: 173; in KMG: 253).  But understood in the context of\nhis system, this is not the proclamation of a harsh, reductive\nscientific realism, for (1) he does not believe that describing and\nexplaining are the only significant dimensions of human activity.  In\nparticular, he recognizes that prescription\nand proscription are (a) different from description and (b)\nindispensable to human activity.  And (2), his conception of ontology\nis object-oriented; the presence of normative truths does not\nbelie his fundamental naturalistic nominalism.  To begin to unpack\nthese claims, we need to look at Sellars\u2019s philosophy of\nlanguage and his ontology.\n",
