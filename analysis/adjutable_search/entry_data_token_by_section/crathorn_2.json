    "main_text": "Epistemology\n3. Epistemology\n\nThe problem of knowledge is at the very heart of Crathorn\u2019s\nthought. Going back to Roger Bacon, he held that the only way the\nhuman mind is able to know the external world is through\nspecies that resemble it (I Sent. q. 1, concl. 4).\nBacon\u2019s theory of the multiplication of species\n(multiplicatio specierum) was developed to explain causality\nusing the model of optics. A thing c has an effect on another\nthing e through the multiplication of species s from\nc towards e, just as light is multiplied through the\nair when it illuminates an object. According to Bacon, the species\ns is a representative of c but with a lesser mode of\nbeing. Thus, the species is multiplied through the medium of air again\nand again until it arrives at e. The causal power of\nc is in this way conserved through the medium until it acts\non e. The species is therefore both the cause (i.e., the same\nthing as the cause but with a diminished mode of being) and a likeness\nof that cause. Applying Bacon\u2019s theory to epistemology, Crathorn\nasserts that we have no direct access to things in the external world\nand that we immediately perceive only their mental likenesses or\nrepresentations, i.e., their species. These mental entities, whether\nwe call them \u2018species\u201c or \u2018concepts\u201d (the\nterms are equivalent for Crathorn), have the same nature as the things\nthey resemble (ibid. concl. 8). Contrary to Bacon, the\nDominican considers that the species has the same mode of being\n\u2014 i.e., material being \u2014 outside and inside the mind. As a\nconsequence, all the species we have in the mind belong to the\ncategory of quality, for no real substance or quantity can exist\nmaterially in the human soul. Since concepts can only belong to the\ncategory of quality according to Crathorn, they must be mental\nqualities having the same nature as non-mental qualities and they must\nexist subjectively in the mind, which is to say that they exist in\nsome part of the brain (Pasnau 1997). Crathorn writes, \u201cthe word\n\u2018cognition\u2019 (cognitio) stands for the idea\n(verbum) of the thing known, and that idea is the quality\nexisting subjectively (subiective existens) in the mind or in\nsome part of the brain\u201d (I Sent. q. 1, concl. 1).\nTherefore, cognition is nothing but the species itself or the part of\nthe soul where it is received and stored. From an ontological point of\nview, nothing distinguishes sensible cognition, imagination and\nintellection except the distinct part of the soul where the species is\nreceived. There is no difference between sensible and intelligible\nspecies.\n\nCrathorn goes on to describe the different parts of the brain and\ntheir functions. As the canonical medieval topology of the brain\nsuggests, there are three main lobes (cellulae) connected by\nnerves through which the information conveyed by the species can be\ntransferred from one lobe to another. The first lobe corresponds to\nsensitive imagination (cellula fantastica), the second to\nconceptualization and discourse (cellula syllogistica) and\nthe third to memory (cellula memoriale) (I Sent. q.\n2, concl. 4).\n\nCrathorn thus had to emend Ockham\u2019s theory of evident knowledge,\nbecause intuitive cognition is no more the guarantee of any certitude\nregarding the existence of extramental things. In addition, the\ncognition of the terms of a proposition \u2014 even a per se\nnota proposition \u2014 is not sufficient, according to\nCrathorn, to ensure the causal mechanism that leads to evidence and\ncertitude. Indeed, as we shall see below, Crathorn refuses to treat\nthe species or cognitions as linguistic elements of thought. All\nlanguages are conventional by nature. Therefore, it is possible to\ncognize some terms the signification of which remains unknown to the\ncognizing subject. As a result, although empirical knowledge of the\nthings signified by the terms is usually needed, it is necessary to\nargue beyond simple and intuitive cognitions, via syllogisms and\ndemonstrations, to consolidate one\u2019s certitude that not only\nrepresentations exist. Crathorn thus suggests that we substitute for\nthe Ockhamist definition of evident cognition his own definition:\nevident cognition is a manifest, clear, and not obscure cognition (q.\n1, p. 69\u201370: notitia evidens est notitia manifesta, clara et\nnon obscura), be it simple or complex, intuitive or\nabstractive.\n\nIncredibly, Crathorn affirms that whenever one is thinking of a white\nthing, the mind of that person actually becomes white. His notion of\nsimilarity is strict and uncompromising. Mental concepts cannot\nresemble substances but only qualities of substances (I\nSent., q. 1, concl. 7) because the species of substance would\nhave to be a substance itself and our minds would turn into a new\nsubstance if we thought of it. It also cannot be a pure quantity\nbecause in thinking of infinite magnitudes, our minds would become\ninfinite, and the same is true for the other categories besides\nquality. According to Crathorn, our ability to conceptualize is\ntherefore limited to natural concepts of qualities, which in being\nconceived become qualities of the soul.\n\nCrathorn had to face up to the skeptical consequences of this odd\nepistemology. How can we know what is real if our only access to\nreality is via representations of its qualitative features? His answer\nto this question is quite radical: we cannot be naturally and directly\ncertain that reality exists as we conceive it since it is not possible\nto distinguish qualities inside and outside the mind: as qualities,\nthey would have precisely the same nature (ibid. concl.\n10\u201313). The only solution to skeptical doubt here is the\nprinciple, which he claims is known per se, that God does not\nproduce an effect supernaturally in order to lie or to lead people\ninto error (ibid. q. 1, concl. 14), a principle more famously\nused in connection with Descartes\u2019 thought experiment of a\nDieu trompeur several centuries later.\n\nCrathorn endeavored elsewhere to gather at least a few certitudes,\nsince one could doubt whether the a priori principle that God would\nnever deceive us is itself certain. To rebut the skeptic, he turns\nback to Augustine\u2019s version of the cogito-argument to\nprove that we can at least be certain of our own mental activity, for\nif one were to doubt a proposition such as \u2018I am\u2019, it\nwould follow that he exists, since he who does not exist does not\ndoubt. Hence, no one can be in doubt concerning the proposition,\n\u2018I am\u2019 (I Sent., q. 1, concl. 14; translated in\nTachau 1988, p. 273).\n",
