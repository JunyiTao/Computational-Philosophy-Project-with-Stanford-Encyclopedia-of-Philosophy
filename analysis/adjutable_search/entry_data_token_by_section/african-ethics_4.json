The Humanistic Foundations of African Morality\n\n\nObservations have been made by a number of scholars that Africans\nare a very\u2014even a notoriously\u2014religious people, that religion so\ndeeply permeates all spheres of their lives that it cannot be\ndistinguished from nonreligious aspects of life, that in the African\ntraditional life there are no atheists, and that the African cultural\nheritage is intensely and pervasively religious. Historical evidence\nindicates that many colonial administrators in their dispatches to\ntheir colonial metropolis used to refer to Africans as \u2018this\nincurably religious people.\u2019 Assertions about the religiosity of\nthe African people have led some scholars to maintain that there is a\nconnection between religion and morality in African ethics. That some\nconnection may exist between religion and morality is conceivable in an\nenvironment that is widely alleged to be pervasively religious. But the\nnature of the connection needs to be fully clarified.\n\n\nThe connection has been taken by most scholars to mean that African\nmoral values and principles derive from religion, implying that\nAfrican morality is, thus, a religious morality (Opoku, 1978: 152),\nDanquah (1944: 3), Sarpong (1972: 41), Busia (1967: 16), Parrinder\n(1969: 28\u20139), Idowu (1962: 146). The claim implies in turn that\nthe moral beliefs and principles of the African people derive from\nthose of religion, that religion provides the necessary justification\nfor moral values and beliefs, and that moral concepts, such as good,\nbad, right and wrong, are defined (or, must be defined) in terms of\nreligious prescriptions or commands. However, there are other\nscholars, such as Godfrey Wilson, Monica Wilson, Maquet, Wiredu, who\ndeny the religious basis of the moral systems of the societies they\nstudied. Kwasi Wiredu observed that \u201cthe Akan moral outlook is\nthus logically independent of religion\u201d (Kwasi Wiredu in\nH. Odera Oruka and D. A. Masolo, 1983: 13). Godfrey Wilson wrote that\n\u201cAmong the Nyakyusa the ideas of social behaviour are not\nconnected with religion, nonetheless they exist\u201d and, after\nmentioning the moral virtues of the Nyakyusa, he added that \u201cBut\nthe positive, ideal statement of these virtues is not made in\nreligious terms\u201d (Godfrey Wilson in Ottenberg and Ottenberg\neds., 1960: 348). On the morality of the Rwanda, Maquet wrote that\n\u2018Thus the ethics of the Banyarwanda are not integrated on a\nreligious basis such as the will of God' (J. J. Maquet in Forde,\n1954:184). In Mende ethics, \u201cWrongbehavior is regarded as a\nbreaking of some specific rule of conduct, not as the flouting of some\ndivine or absolute law of the universe\u201d (Kenneth Little, in\nForde, 1954:134). These are unambiguous statements of the nonreligious\nfoundation of the morality of at least some African societies.\n\n\nThe claim, made by many scholars, that African morality is founded\non, or derives from, religion cannot, in my opinion, be upheld, if by\nmorality we are referring to social principles and norms that guide the\nconduct of people in a society. One reason is that, unlike Islam or\nChristianity, the traditional, that is, indigenous, African religion is\nnot a revealed religion whereby divine truth is revealed to a single\nindividual who becomes the founder. It is true that African religious\nexperience certainly features mystical or highly spiritual encounters\nbetween human beings (that is, priests, priestesses, diviners, etc.)\nand spiritual beings. Such encounters occur in divinations, spirit\nmediums, communication with the dead, and other forms of the mystical\nexperience. But, it may be noted, such mystical or spiritual encounters\nor contacts take place in an atmosphere that was already\nreligious; they are some of the manifestations of African religion, of\nAfrican spirituality.\n\n\nI define spirituality as a heightened form of religiosity\nreached by certain individuals in the community who have, or claim to\nhave, mystical contacts with the supernatural, the divine. It would be\ncorrect to assert, however, that the encounters are the\nresults, rather than the sources, of religion in Africa in the\ntraditional setting. And, even though \u2018spiritual messages\u2019\nmay be received by the practitioners of traditional African religion\nthrough those mystical encounters part of which\n(\u2018messages\u2019) may relate to moral conduct, nevertheless such\nmessages appear to be too few and far between to constitute an adequate\nbasis for a coherent ethical system. Moreover, the .moral character of\nsuch \u2018messages\u2019 would, in a non-revealed religious context,\nhave to be judged by the people themselves on the basis of their own\nmoral insights. This is a telling point that implies the independence\n(autonomy) of the moral attitudes of the people with regard to the\nconduct of the spiritual beings. This is the reason why an eminent\nGhanaian sociologist observed that \u201cThe gods are treated with\nrespect if they deliver the goods, and with contempt if they\nfail\u2026.Attitudes to [the gods] depend on their success [i.e., the\nsuccess of the gods], and vary from healthy respect to sneering\ncontempt\u201d (K. A. Busia in Forde, 1954: 205). The moral\ndisapprobation of the people with regard to the actions\u2014particularly\nthe unsuccessful actions\u2014of the deities constitutes the ground for the\nextinction of some of the deities from the Akan, possibly the African,\npantheon. The fact that the behavior of a supernatural being is thus\nsubject to human censure implies that it is possible for a\ndeity to issue commands that can be considered unethical by the\npractitioners of traditional religion. All this implies, surely, that\nit would be correct to assert that, rather than regarding African ethics\nas religious (or, religious-based), it would be more correct to regard\nAfrican religion as ethical.\n\n\nIn a revealed religion, what is revealed is generally\nelaborate and can be conceived to include moral principles and ideals\nas part of the will of God thus revealed. A morality that is founded on\nreligion is thus a necessary concomitant of a revealed religion. Since\nthe indigenous African religion is not a revealed religion, there is no\nway by which the people would have access to the will of God that\ncontains elaborate moral principles upon which a coherent moral system\ncan be erected. In the context of a non-revealed religion, then, to\nmake divine or supernatural commands the source of moral values and\nprinciples would be conceptually impossible.\n\n\nNow, how are the moral concepts of good, evil, right and wrong\nunderstood or defined in African ethics? When put to traditional\nsages (thinkers) of some Akan communities in Ghana the question, how do\nwe come to know that \u2018this action\u2019 is good and \u2018that\naction\u2019 is evil? no one responded that an action is good or evil\nbecause God (Onyame) had said so or that Onyame had\ntold us so. Thus, what is morally good or right is not that which is\ncommanded by God or pleasing to God or any spiritual being, or that\nwhich is in accordance with the will of a spiritual being. The\nresponses revealed, on the contrary, an undoubted conviction of a\nhumanistic\u2014a non-supernatural\u2014origin of moral values and\nprinciples, a conviction that provided insight into the Akan conception\nof the criterion of moral value. According to the ethics of the\nBanyarwanda, \u201cThat is good (or evil) which tradition has defined\nas good (or evil)\u201d (J. J. Maquet, loc. cit). In light of\nthe non-revealed nature of traditional African religion, it can be said\nthat the view regarding the non-religious (non-supernatural) origin of\nmoral principles and values would resonate on the moral terrains of\nmost other African communities. The sources of African morality in the\ntraditional setting, then, must be held as independent of religious\nprescriptions or supernatural powers.\n\n\nThe views of the traditional thinkers indicate that what is\ngood is constituted by the deeds, habits, and behavior patterns\nconsidered by the society as worthwhile because of their consequences\nfor human welfare. The goods would include such things as generosity,\nhonesty, faithfulness, truthfulness, compassion, hospitality,\nhappiness, that which brings peace, justice, respect, and so on. Each\nof these actions or patterns of behavior is supposed or known to bring\nabout social well-being. In Akan moral system (or African moral system\ngenerally), good or moral value is determined in terms of its\nconsequences for humankind and human society. All this can be\ninterpreted to mean that African morality originates from\nconsiderations of human welfare and interests, not from divine\npronouncements. Actions that promote human welfare or interest are\ngood, while those that detract from human welfare are bad. It is, thus,\npretty clear that African ethics is a humanistic ethics, a moral system\nthat is preoccupied with human welfare. Referring to African morality\ngenerally, Monica Wilson observed that \u201cThe basis of morality was\nfulfillment of obligation to kinsmen and neighbors, and living in amity\nwith them\u201d (1971: 98).\n\nIn African conceptions moral values originate from the\nbasic existential conditions in which human beings organize and conduct\ntheir lives. McVeigh made the following observation:\n\nTherefore, it is important to inquire concerning the African standard\nof judgment, what makes some things good and others bad. [Edwin] Smith\nreplies that the norm of right and wrong is custom; that is, the good\nis that which receives the community's approval; the bad is that\nwhich is disapproved. The right builds up society; the wrong tears it\ndown. One is social; the other anti-social (Malcolm J. McVeigh, 1974:\n84).\n\n\nIn the ethics of the Lovedu, a South Bantu ethnic group of the\nTransvaal:\n\n Right conduct is relative always to the human situation and\nmorality is oriented not from any absolute standards of honesty or\ntruth but from the social good in each situation. Conduct\nthat promotes smooth relationships, that upholds the social structure,\nis good; conduct that runs counter to smooth social relationships is\nbad (J. D. and E. J. Krige in Forde, 1954: 78). \n\n\nAnd, regarding the basis of Bantu morality, Molema remarked:\n\n The greatest happiness and good of the tribe was the end and aim of\neach member of the tribe. Now, utility forms part of the basis of\nperhaps all moral codes. With the Bantu, it formed the basis of\nmorality\u2026it was utilitarian.  This was the standard of\ngoodness, and in harmony with, and conformity to, this end must the\nmoral conduct be moulded. The effect of this, of course, was\naltruism (S.  M. Molema, 1920: 116). \n\n\nStatements and references made in the immediately foregoing\nparagraphs indicate the nonreligious foundation of African ethics. Now,\nhaving removed African ethics from its alleged religious moorings,\nwhere do we moor it? The answer, based on the foregoing references, is\nthat we moor it to the preoccupations of the African society with human\nwelfare and social harmony, to reflections on the existential\nconditions in which human beings function.\n\n\nNot being a revealed religion, traditional African religion can be\ncharacterized as a natural religion, a religion that derives from the\npeoples' own reflections on this complex world and their\nexperiences in it. The African metaphysic, to be sure, is a theistic\nmetaphysic; yet it does not nurture a theistic or supernatural ethic.\nJust as it was their own reflections that led to the creation of a\nnatural religion, so it was their own reflections on living a\nharmonious and cooperative life in a human society that led to the\ncreation of a \u2018natural\u2019 (a humanistic) ethic. Thus, side by\nside with Africa's natural religion (or, theology) is a\n\u2018natural\u2019 ethic grounded in human experiences in living\ntogether, a society-oriented morality that, thus, arises from the\nexistential conditions in which people conduct their lives. And so it\nis, that the moral values of the African people have a social and\nhumanistic, rather than a religious, basis and are fashioned according\nto the people's own understanding of the nature of human society,\nhuman relations, human goals, and the meaning of human life with its\nemotional features.\n\n\nWith all this said, however, it cannot be denied that religion plays\nsome role in the moral lives of people, such as African people, who\nare said to be \u201cincurably religious\u201d. Because God is held\nby the African people not only to be the overlord of the human society\nbut also to have a superbly moral character, and because the ancestors\n(ancestral spirits) are also supposed to be interested in the welfare\nof the society (they left behind), including the moral life of the\nindividual, religion constitutes part of the sanctions that are in\nplay in matters of moral practice. Thus, religion cannot be\ntotally banished from the domain of moral practice, notwithstanding\nthe fact that the moral values and principles of the African society\ndo not derive from religion.\n\n\nHumanism\u2014the doctrine that takes human welfare, interests, and\nneeds as fundamental\u2014constitutes the foundation of African ethics. It\nis the warp and woof the African moral life and thought. Indeed,\nAfrican prayers and other acts of worship are brimful of, or\ncharacterized by, requests to the supernatural beings for material\ncomforts, such as prosperity, health, and riches. And, even though the\nAfrican people do not consider God and other supernatural beings as the\nsources of their moral values and principles, nevertheless, they are\never aware of the powers of the supernatural beings and are ever ready\nto exploit their munificence for the promotion of human welfare,\nprosperity, and happiness.\n",
