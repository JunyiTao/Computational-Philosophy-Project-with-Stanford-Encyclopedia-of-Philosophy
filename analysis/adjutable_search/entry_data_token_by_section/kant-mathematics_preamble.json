    "main_text": "\n\nKant was a student and a teacher of mathematics throughout his career,\nand his reflections on mathematics and mathematical practice had a\nprofound impact on his philosophical thought (Martin 1985; Moretto\n2015). He developed considered philosophical views on the status of\nmathematical judgment, the nature of mathematical concepts,\ndefinitions, axioms and proof, and the relation between pure\nmathematics and the natural world. Moreover, his approach to the\ngeneral question \u201chow are synthetic judgments a priori\npossible?\u201d was shaped by his conception of mathematics and its\nachievements as a well-grounded science.\n\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics is of interest to a variety of\nscholars for multiple reasons. First, his thoughts on mathematics are\na crucial and central component of his critical philosophical system,\nand so they are illuminating to the historian of philosophy working on\nany aspect of Kant\u2019s corpus. Additionally, issues of\ncontemporary interest and relevance arise from Kant\u2019s\nreflections on the most fundamental and elementary mathematical\ndisciplines, issues that continue to inform important questions in the\nmetaphysics and epistemology of mathematics. Finally, disagreements\nabout how to interpret Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics have\ngenerated a fertile area of current research and debate.\n",
