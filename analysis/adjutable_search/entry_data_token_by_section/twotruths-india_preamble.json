    "main_text": "\n\nThe theory of the two truths has a twenty-five century long history\nbehind it. It has its origin in the sixth century\n BCE[1]\n India with the emergence of the Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama. It is said,\naccording to the Pit\u0101p\u016btrasam\u0101gama-s\u016btra,\nSiddh\u0101rtha became a buddha \u201cawakened one\u201d because he\nfully understood the meaning of the two truths\u2014conventional\ntruth (sa\u1e41v\u1e5bti-satya) and ultimate truth\n(param\u0101rtha-satya)\u2014and that the reality of all the objects\nof knowledge, the text says, is exhaustively comprised of the two\ntruths (Sde Dge, dkon brtsegs nga, 60b). The theory of the\ntwo truths, according to the\nSam\u0101dhir\u0101ja-s\u016btra, is a unique contribution\nmade by the Buddha towards Indian philosophy. This text states:\n\u201cthe knower of the world, without hearing it from others, taught\nthat there are the two truths\u201d (Sde dge, mdo-sde da\n174b\u2013210b). N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, in his\nM\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101 [MMK], attributes the two\ntruths to the Buddha as follows: \u201cthe Dharma taught by the\nbuddhas is precisely based on the two truths: a truth of mundane\nconventions and a truth of the ultimate\u201d ([MMK] 24:8).\n\nThe Madhyamaka philosophers claim the theory of the two truths is the\nheart of the Buddha\u2019s philosophy. According to them, it serves as the\nmirror reflecting the core message of the Buddha\u2019s teachings and the\nmassive philosophical literature it inspired. At the heart of the\ntheory of the two truths is the Buddha\u2019s ever poignant existential and\nsoteriological concerns about the reality of things and of life.\nNirv\u0101\u1e47 ultimate freedom from the suffering conditioned by\ndesires, is only ever achieved, according to the theory of the two\ntruths, from a correct understanding of two truths. Knowledge of the\nconventional truth informs us how things are conventional, from the\nordinary commonsense perspective and thus grounds our epistemic\npractice in its proper linguistic and conceptual conventional\nframework. Knowledge of the ultimate truth informs us of how things\nreally are ultimate, from the ultimate analytical perspective and so\ntakes our minds beyond the bounds of conceptual and linguistic\nconventions.\n\nIn the theory of the two truths, as we know it today, maybe unknown to\nthe earliest start of Buddhist thought in India. Contemporary\nscholarship suggests that the Buddha himself may not have made any\nexplicit reference to the two truths. The early textual materials such\nas Pali Nik\u0101yas and \u0101gamas ascribe to the Buddha does not\nmake explicit mention of the distinction of the two truths. Recent\nstudies also suggest that the two truths distinction is an innovation\non the part of the Abhidhamma which came into prominence originally as\na heuristic device, useful for later interpreters to reconcile\napparent inconsistent statements in the Buddha\u2019s teachings\n(Karunadasa, 2006: 1; 1996: 25\u20136 and n.139, The Cowherds, 2011; 5).\nThis distinction is however not entirely disconnected from the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings. The antecedent hermeneutic distinctions drawn in\nthe A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya (AN II.60) between two linguistic\nconcepts (pa\u00f1\u00f1atti) \u2013 nitattha (Skt.\nnit\u0101rtha) and neyyatta (Skt. ney\u0101rtha)\n\u2013 provides us with a useful insight into the rationale basis\nfrom which later develops the formulation of the two truths\ndistinction. This latter pair of terms deals with the hermeneutic\nstrategies explaining the purported meaning of the Buddhist scriptural\nstatements. Nitattha is a statement the meaning of which is\n\u201cdrawn out\u201d (nita-attha), definitive and explicit,\ntaken as its stands, and neyyattha is a statement the meaning of which\nis \u201cto be drawn out\u201d (neyya-attha) and interpretive\n(Karunadasa, 1996: 25). The commentary (A\u1e45guttaranik\u0101ya\nA\u1e6d\u1e6dhakatah II.118) on the A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya\nII.60 explores nitattha/neyyattha distinction\u2019s connection with the\nsammuti/paramattha distinction. This simple heuristic device however\nstimulated rich philosophical exchanges amongst the Buddhist\nphilosophers and practitioners, not to mention the exchanges with\ntraditional Hindu thinkers. The exchange of different ideas and views\nof the two truths between the early Buddhists, among other factors,\ngave birth to Buddhism as the philosophy we know today. The\ntransformation of the two truths theory from a simple hermeneutic\nstrategy to a complex system of thought with highly sophisticated\nontological, epistemological and semantic theories blurring a clear\nmethodological distinction between \u201creality\u201d and\n\u201ctruth\u201d. As always two terms \u2013 reality and truth\n\u2013 are expressed with one Sanskrit term satya; often\nreality/truth is seen as having an interchangeable usage and meaning.\nThis philosophical development is perhaps the most significant\ncontribution resulting from the schisms the Buddhism experienced after\nthe Buddha passed away (ca. 380 BCE). Various schools with varying\ninterpretations of the Buddha\u2019s words soon appeared in Buddhism, which\nresulted in a rich and vibrant philosophical and hermeneutic\natmosphere.\n\nIn later years, Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din (Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika) and\nSautr\u0101ntika, Madhyamaka (from the first century CE onwards) and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra (ca. sixth century CE onwards) became the dominant\nschools. Our investigation of the theory of the two truths will\nbriefly focus on how these schools have received, interpreted and\nunderstood it. Although all these schools regard the theory of two\ntruths as the centrepiece of the Buddha\u2019s philosophy, all have\nnevertheless adopted very different approaches to the theory. As we\nshall see each understood and interpreted the two truths in different\nways, and are often fundamentally and radically opposed to each\nother.\n",
