    "main_text": "The Varieties of Religious Experience\n6. Late Writings\nPragmatism (1907)\n\nJames first announced his commitment to pragmatism in a lecture at\nBerkeley in 1898, entitled \u201cPhilosophical Conceptions and\nPractical Results.\u201d Later sources for Pragmatism were\nlectures at Wellesley College in 1905, and at the Lowell Institute and\nColumbia University in 1906 and 1907. Pragmatism emerges in\nJames\u2019s book as six things: a philosophical temperament, a\ntheory of truth, a theory of meaning, a holistic account of knowledge,\na metaphysical view, and a method of resolving philosophical\ndisputes.\n\nThe pragmatic temperament appears in the book\u2019s opening chapter,\nwhere (following a method he first set out in \u201cRemarks on\nSpencer\u2019s Definition of Mind as Correspondence\u201d) James\nclassifies philosophers according to their temperaments: in this case\n\u201ctough-minded\u201d or \u201ctender-minded.\u201d The\npragmatist is the mediator between these extremes, someone, like James\nhimself, with \u201cscientific loyalty to facts,\u201d but also\n\u201cthe old confidence in human values and the resultant\nspontaneity, whether of the religious or romantic type\u201d (P 17).\nThe method of resolving disputes and the theory of meaning are on\ndisplay in James\u2019s discussion of an argument about whether a man\nchasing a squirrel around a tree goes around the squirrel too. Taking\nmeaning as the  \u201cconceivable effects of a practical kind\nthe object may involve,\u201d the pragmatist philosopher finds that\ntwo \u201cpractical\u201d meanings of \u201cgo around\u201d are in\nplay: either the man goes North, East, South, and West of the\nsquirrel, or he faces first the squirrel\u2019s head, then one of his\nsides, then his tail, then his other side. \u201cMake the\ndistinction,\u201d James writes, \u201cand there is no occasion for\nany further dispute.\u201d\n\nThe pragmatic theory of truth is the subject of the book\u2019s sixth\n(and to some degree its second) chapter. Truth, James holds, is\n\u201ca species of the good,\u201d like health. Truths are goods\nbecause we can \u201cride\u201d on them into the future without\nbeing unpleasantly surprised. They \u201clead us into useful verbal\nand conceptual quarters as well as directly up to useful sensible\ntermini. They lead to consistency, stability and flowing human\nintercourse.  They lead away from excentricity and isolation,\nfrom foiled and barren thinking\u201d (103). Although James holds\nthat truths are \u201cmade\u201d (104) in the course of\nhuman experience, and that for the most part they live \u201con a\ncredit system\u201d in that they are not currently being verified, he\nalso holds the empiricistic view that \u201cbeliefs verified\nconcretely by somebody are the posts of the whole\nsuperstructure\u201d (P 100).\n\nJames\u2019s chapter on \u201cPragmatism and Humanism\u201d sets\nout his voluntaristic epistemology. \u201cWe carve out\neverything,\u201d James states, \u201cjust as we carve out\nconstellations, to serve our human purposes\u201d (P 100).\nNevertheless, he recognizes \u201cresisting factors in every\nexperience of truth-making\u201d (P 117), including not only our\npresent sensations or experiences but the whole body of our prior\nbeliefs. James holds neither that we create our truths out of nothing,\nnor that truth is entirely independent of humanity. He embraces\n\u201cthe humanistic principle: you can\u2019t weed out the human\ncontribution\u201d (P 122). He also embraces a metaphysics of\nprocess in the claim that \u201cfor pragmatism [reality] is still in\nthe making,\u201d whereas for \u201crationalism reality is\nready-made and complete from all eternity\u201d (P 123).\nPragmatism\u2019s final chapter on \u201cPragmatism and\nReligion\u201d follows James\u2019s line in Varieties in\nattacking \u201ctranscendental absolutism\u201d for its unverifiable\naccount of God, and in defending a \u201cpluralistic and moralistic\nreligion\u201d (144) based on human experience. \u201cOn\npragmatistic principles,\u201d James writes, \u201cif the hypothesis\nof God works satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, it is\ntrue\u201d (143).\nA Pluralistic Universe (1909)\n\nOriginally delivered in Oxford as a set of lectures \u201cOn the\nPresent Situation in Philosophy,\u201d James begins his book, as he\nhad begun Pragmatism, with a discussion of the temperamental\ndetermination of philosophical theories, which, James states,\n\u201care just so many visions, modes of feeling the whole push\n\u2026 forced on one by one\u2019s total character and experience,\nand on the whole preferred\u2014there is no other truthful\nword\u2014as one\u2019s best working attitude\u201d (PU 15).\nMaintaining that a philosopher\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d is\n\u201cthe important thing\u201d about him (PU 3), James condemns the\n\u201cover-technicality and consequent dreariness of the younger\ndisciples at our American universities\u2026\u201d (PU 13).\n\nJames passes from critical discussions of Josiah Royce\u2019s\nidealism and the \u201cvicious intellectualism\u201d of Hegel to\nphilosophers whose visions he admires: Gustav Fechner and Henri\nBergson. He praises Fechner for holding that \u201cthe whole universe\nin its different spans and wave-lengths, exclusions and developments,\nis everywhere alive and conscious\u201d (PU, 70), and he seeks to\nrefine and justify Fechner\u2019s idea that separate human, animal\nand vegetable consciousnesses meet or merge in a \u201cconsciousness\nof still wider scope\u201d (PU 72). James employs Henri\nBergson\u2019s critique of \u201cintellectualism\u201d to argue\nthat the \u201cconcrete pulses of experience appear pent in by no\nsuch definite limits as our conceptual substitutes are confined by.\nThey run into one another continuously and seem to\ninterpenetrate\u201d (PU 127). James concludes by embracing a\nposition that he had more tentatively set forth in The Varieties\nof Religious Experience: that religious experiences \u201cpoint\nwith reasonable probability to the continuity of our consciousness\nwith a wider spiritual environment from which the ordinary prudential\nman (who is the only man that scientific psychology, so called, takes\ncognizance of) is shut off\u201d (PU 135). Whereas in\nPragmatism James subsumes the religious within the pragmatic\n(as yet another way of successfully making one\u2019s way through the\nworld), in A Pluralistic Universe he suggests that the\nreligious offers a superior relation to the universe.\nEssays in Radical Empiricism (1912)\n\nThis posthumous collection includes James\u2019s groundbreaking\nessays on \u201cpure experience,\u201d originally published in\n1904\u20135. James\u2019s fundamental idea is that mind and matter\nare both aspects of, or structures formed from, a more fundamental\nstuff\u2014pure experience\u2014that (despite being called\n\u201cexperience\u201d) is neither mental nor physical. Pure\nexperience, James explains, is \u201cthe immediate flux of life which\nfurnishes the material to our later reflection with its conceptual\ncategories\u2026 a that which is not yet any definite \nwhat, tho\u2019 ready to be all sorts of whats\u2026\u201d\n(ERE 46). That \u201cwhats\u201d pure experience may be are minds\nand bodies, people and material objects, but this depends not on a\nfundamental ontological difference among these \u201cpure\nexperiences,\u201d but on the relations into which they\nenter. Certain sequences of pure experiences constitute physical\nobjects, and others constitute persons; but one pure experience (say\nthe perception of a chair) may be part both of the sequence\nconstituting the chair and of the sequence constituting a person.\nIndeed, one pure experience might be part of two distinct minds, as\nJames explains in a chapter entitled \u201cHow Two Minds Can Know One\nThing.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019s \u201cradical empiricism\u201d is distinct from his\n\u201cpure experience\u201d metaphysics. It is never precisely\ndefined in the Essays, and is best explicated by a passage\nfrom The Meaning of Truth where James states that radical\nempiricism consists of a postulate, a statement of fact, and a\nconclusion. The postulate is that \u201cthe only things that shall be\ndebatable among philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn\nfrom experience,\u201d the  fact is that relations are just as\ndirectly experienced as the things they relate, and the conclusion is\nthat \u201cthe parts of experience hold together from next to next by\nrelations that are themselves parts of experience\u201d (MT,\n6\u20137).\n\nJames was still working on objections to his \u201cpure\nexperience\u201d doctrine, replying to critics of\nPragmatism, and writing an introduction to philosophical\nproblems when he died in 1910. His legacy extends into psychology and\nthe study of religion, and in philosophy not only throughout the\npragmatist tradition that he founded (along with Charles Peirce), but\ninto phenomenology and analytic philosophy. Edmund Husserl\nincorporated James\u2019s notions of the \u201cfringe\u201d and\n\u201chalo\u201d into his phenomenology (Moran, pp. 276\u201380),\nBertrand Russell\u2019s The Analysis of Mind is indebted to\nJames\u2019s doctrine of \u201cpure experience,\u201d (Russell,\n1921, pp. 22\u20136), Ludwig Wittgenstein learned about \u201cthe\nabsence of the will act\u201d from James\u2019s Psychology\n(Goodman, Wittgenstein and William James, p. 81), and the\nversions of \u201cneopragmatism\u201d set out by Nelson Goodman,\nRichard Rorty and Hilary Putnam are saturated with James\u2019s\nideas. In physics, James\u2019s humanistic pragmatism, and his\nsuggestion that \u201cnew being come[s] in local spots and\npatches\u201d (P 138; Fuchs 2017, p.  33) have inspired the version\nof quantum theory known as QBism (see Healey). James is one of the\nmost attractive and endearing of philosophers: for his vision of a\n\u201cwild,\u201d \u201copen\u201d universe that is nevertheless\nshaped by our human powers and answers to some of our deepest needs,\nbut also, as Russell observed in his obituary, because of the\n\u201clarge tolerance and \u2026 humanity\u201d with which he sets\nthat vision out.
