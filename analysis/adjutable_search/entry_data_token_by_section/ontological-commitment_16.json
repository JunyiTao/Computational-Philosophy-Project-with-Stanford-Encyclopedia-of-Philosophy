    "main_text": "Frege and Neo-Fregeanism || Frege\n5.1 Frege \nAlthough explicit discussion of ontological commitment postdates\nFrege's writings, an account of ontological commitment can be garnered\nfrom his defense of arithmetical platonism in The Foundations of\nArithmetic (Frege 1884). That account is embedded in the\nfollowing argument for the claim that numbers exist as\n\u201cself-subsistent objects\u201d (see Wright (1990), who calls\nthe argument \u201cdeceptively simple\u201d). The semantic role of\nsingular terms (Frege's proper names) is to refer to\nobjects. When singular terms occur in true sentences of an appropriate\nkind\u00ad\u2014extensional sentences generally, and identity\nsentences in particular\u2014they cannot help but to refer; for that\nis their contribution to the truth of the sentence. Appropriate\nsentences involving numerical singular terms are sometimes true;\nwitness \u2018the number of planets is nine\u2019 and\n\u20181+1=2\u2019. Therefore, these singular terms refer to\nobjects. Moreover, the argument may be continued, since some of these\nsingular terms\u2014those of the form \u2018the number\nof Fs\u2019\u2014figure in the identity condition\ndefinitive of the concept of number (Hume's Principle, see below), the\nobjects referred to are properly called\n\u201cnumbers\u201d. Therefore, numbers exist.\nThis argument might be challenged in two different ways.  First,\none might deny that sentences containing numerical singular terms are\n(literally) true; one might, for example, endorse a fictionalist\naccount of mathematics (Field 1980). For our purposes, we can sidestep\nthis objection and focus on the other premise of the argument, that\nextensional sentences containing numerical singular terms, if true,\nrefer to numbers\u2014which is to say, in other words, that such\nsentences, whether true or not, are ontologically committed\nto numbers. If this is to serve as a criterion of ontological\ncommitment, there must be some purely syntactic way of\ndetermining which expressions are genuine singular terms; if genuine\nsingular terms are characterized semantically\u2014for\nexample, as expressions that refer to objects when they occur in true\nextensional sentences\u2014then the account of ontological commitment\ngoes in a circle. Thus, Fregean accounts are committed to\na syntactic priority thesis: ontology depends on ontological\ncommitment plus truth; and ontological commitment in turn depends on\nsyntax (see Wright 1983 for extended discussion).\nIn various scattered remarks, Frege appears to endorse the\nsyntactic priority thesis. For example, he writes (1884: \u00a757):\n\u201cwe say \u2018the [number] 1\u2019, and by means of the\ndefinite article, set up 1 as an object\u201d. And he notes that\nnumerals occur, not only attributively, for example, in \u2018Jupiter\nhas four moons\u2019, but also in identity statements, such as\n\u2018the number of Jupiter's moons is four\u2019; and the sense of\nsuch an identity statement is just that \u201cthe expression\n\u2018the number of Jupiter's moons\u2019 denotes the same object as\nthe word \u2018four\u2019\u201d. The difficulty of identifying the\nappropriate use of the definite article, or when \u2018is\u2019\nsignals a genuine identity statement, was, perhaps, not sufficiently\nappreciated by Frege. But recent work (especially Dummett (1973) and\nHale (1996)) has given some reason to think that genuine singular\nterms in English can be recognized syntactically in terms of their\ninferential role.\nSuppose that the task of providing syntactic criteria for\nidentifying genuine singular terms can be accomplished. Suppose,\nmoreover, that there are syntactic criteria for saying when a genuine\nsingular term purports to refer to objects of kind K.  Then\nthe Fregean can put forth the following sufficient condition for\nontological commitment: \n\nFregean Account.  Suppose that t is a singular\nterm purporting to refer to objects of kind K.  Then, any\nextensional theory containing the term t is ontologically\ncommitted to Ks.\n\nNote that, unlike the criteria for ontological commitment\nconsidered heretofore, this is intended only as a sufficient\ncondition for ontological commitment. For one thing, just as Frege\ntook singular terms to be a vehicle for commitment\nto objects, he took incomplete expressions to be a vehicle of\ncommitment to concepts and (more\ngenerally) functions. Unlike Quine, Frege treated all\nmeaningful expressions on a par with respect to ontological\ncommitment. But even if we restrict our attention to ontological\ncommitment to objects, there is no reason to think that Frege's\ncriterion is necessary as well as sufficient. Frege could well have\nallowed existentially quantified sentences to be ontologically\ncommitted to objects, whether or not they were equivalent to\ndisjunctions of sentences containing singular terms.\nIn one important respect, Frege's approach to ontological\ncommitment is in agreement with Quine's. Both hold that the smallest\nunit of ontological commitment is the complete sentence.  For Frege,\nthis can be seen as an uncontroversial application of his\nfamous Context Principle: \u201cit is only in the context of\na proposition that words have any meaning\u201d (Frege 1884:\n\u00a762). It follows that attribution of ontological commitment to\npersons always goes by way of the theories (sentences) that they\naccept. This approach to ontological commitment is common to all\nmainstream views in contemporary analytic philosophy. It could be\ndenied, however, by a philosopher who holds that we stand in\nintentional relations, not only to propositions, but also to\nobjects. For such a philosopher, plausibly, a person is ontologically\ncommitted to the objects of her thought, and the kinds they exemplify,\nindependently of what propositions she takes to be true of those\nobjects, or even whether there are any such propositions.\nThe Fregean approach to ontological commitment differs from\northodox Quinean approaches most obviously in its emphasis on singular\nterms as opposed to quantifiers and variables. But this may reflect\nmore a difference in their accounts of singular terms than a\nsubstantial difference in their accounts of ontological commitment;\nboth approaches, after all, focus on the referential\napparatus of the language. Quine eliminated all singular\nterms prior to assessing ontological commitment: definite\ndescriptions were eliminated via Russell's theory of descriptions;\nnames were eliminated in favor of predicates satisfied by at most one\nthing.  This allowed Quine to sidestep issues arising from ostensibly\nempty names (see \u00a71.2 above). Frege, on\nthe other hand, took singular terms to be the locus of commitment to\nobjects. In Frege 1892, he writes: \u201cwhen we say \u2018the\nmoon\u2019 \u2026 we presuppose a reference\u201d. Singular terms,\nthen, are ontologically committing in this sense: they presuppose\nreference to objects. This applies no less to empty names that in fact\nfail to refer. Frege writes:\n\n anyone who seriously took the sentence\n[\u201cOdysseus \u2026\u201d] to be true or false would ascribe to\nthe name \u201cOdysseus\u201d a reference.\n\nThis has a couple of awkward consequences. For one, it follows that\ndenials of existence cannot be made with empty names: \u201cOdysseus\nnever existed\u201d is neither true nor false. But perhaps these\ndenials won't much be missed, since we can always say instead that the\nname \u2018Odysseus\u2019 doesn't refer. For another, sentences with\nfictional names are always ontologically committing. But, ultimately,\nit is the ontological commitment of persons that we care about, not\nsentences. A person may use a sentence containing a singular\nterm\u2014for example, an actor on the stage\u2014without inheriting\nthe sentence's ontological commitments. Only when a person judges the\nsentence to be true is she committed to an object as referent of the\nsingular term, and to the kinds of entity to which the object\nbelongs.\nAnother difference between Frege and Quine (but not all Quineans)\nis that Frege's account of ontological commitment applies directly to\nsentences of ordinary language. Quine's account applies only\nindirectly to sentences of ordinary language via the method of\nparaphrase, or, in what seems to be his \u201cofficial\u201d view,\nnot at all. This difference leads to different, and more onerous,\ndemands being placed on the Fregean. As already noted, the Fregean\nmust discover syntactic criteria for identifying genuine singular\nterms in ordinary language. Quine never engaged in the corresponding\nproject: finding syntactic criteria for identifying objectual\nquantifiers in ordinary language. As we saw\nin \u00a74.2, that task is none too easy, and\nthere is substantial disagreement even over basic\ncases. But, contra Quine, it is a task that must be carried\nout if quantifier approaches to ontological commitment are to have\nphilosophical application.  Philosophers, after all, do not often\nspeak or write in Quine's target language: first-order predicate\nlogic. Quinean approaches\u2014if they are to provide a\ntheory-neutral criterion of ontological commitment applicable to\nordinary language\u2014are no less beholden to the syntactic priority\nthesis than Fregean approaches.\n",
