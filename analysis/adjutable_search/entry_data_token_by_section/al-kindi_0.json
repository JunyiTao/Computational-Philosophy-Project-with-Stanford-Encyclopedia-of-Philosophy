    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\n\nAl-Kindi was a member of the Arab tribe of Kinda, which had played an\nimportant role in the early history of Islam. His lineage earned him\nthe title \u201cphilosopher of the Arabs\u201d among later writers.\nWe know that al-Kindi died after 866 CE, and his death date is usually\nput in the early 870s. His birth date is harder to pin down, but he\nis said to have served as a scholar under the caliph al-Ma\u2019mun,\nwhose reign ended in 833, and he was certainly associated with the\ncourt of the next caliph, al-Mu\u2018tasim (reigned\n833\u2013842). He is thus usually reckoned to have been born around\n800 CE. He was born in Basra and educated in Baghdad. His\nphilosophical career peaked under al-Mu\u2018tasim, to whom al-Kindi\ndedicated his most famous work, On First Philosophy, and\nwhose son Ahmad was tutored by al-Kindi.\n\n\nAl-Kindi\u2019s philosophical activities centered around the\ntranslation movement that had been initiated and supported by the\n\u2018Abbasid caliphs since prior to al-Kindi\u2019s birth (on this\nsee Endress 1987/1992, Gutas 1998). Al-Kindi oversaw one of the two\nmain groups of translators in the ninth century (the other group was\nled by Hunayn ibn Ishaq). The \u201cKindi circle\u201d (see Endress\n1997) translated numerous works of philosophy and science from Greek\ninto Arabic. (On the output of the circle see below, 2.1.) Al-Kindi\nseems to have been a mediator between the patrons of these translators\nand the scholars who actually did the translating, many of whom were\nSyrian Christians or of Syrian extraction. His own writings might be\nthought of as a sustained public relations campaign intended to display\nand advertise the value of Greek thought for a contemporary ninth\ncentury Muslim audience.\n",
