    "main_text": "Quantum Non-Individuality\n2. Quantum Non-Individuality\n\n\nThe argument for the above conclusion \u2013 that the fundamental\nobjects of physics cannot be regarded as individuals \u2013 can be\nsummed up as follows: First of all, both \u2018classical\u2019 and\n\u2018quantal\u2019 objects of the same kind (e.g. electrons) can be\nregarded as indistinguishable in the sense of possessing the same\nintrinsic properties, such as rest mass, charge, spin etc. Consider now\nthe distribution of two such indistinguishable particles over two\nboxes, or two states in general: \n\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\nFigure\n\n\n\nIn classical physics, (3) is given a weight of twice that of (1) or\n(2), corresponding to the two ways the former can be achieved by\npermuting the particles. This gives us four combinations or complexions\nin total and hence we can conclude that the probability of finding one\nparticle in each state, for example, is 1/2. (Note that it is assumed\nthat none of the four combinations is regarded as privileged in any\nway, so each is just as likely to occur.) This is an example of the\nwell-known \u2018Maxwell-Boltzmann\u2019 statistics to which, it is\nclaimed, thermodynamics was reduced at the turn of the twentieth century. \n\n\nIn quantum statistical mechanics, however, we have two\n\u2018standard\u2019 forms: one for which there are three possible\narrangements in the above situation (both particles in one box, both\nparticles in the other, and one in each box), giving\n\u2018Bose-Einstein\u2019 statistics; and one for which there is\nonly one arrangement (one particle in each box), giving\n\u2018Fermi-Dirac\u2019 statistics (which underpins the Pauli\nExclusion Principle and all that entails). Setting aside the\ndifferences between these two kinds of quantum statistics, the\nimportant point for the present discussion is that in the quantum\ncase, a permutation of the particles is not regarded as giving rise to\na new arrangement. This result lies at the very heart of quantum\nphysics; putting things slightly more formally, it is expressed by the\nso-called \u2018Indistinguishability Postulate\u2019:\nIf a particle permutation P is applied to any\nstate function for an assembly of particles, then there is no way of\ndistinguishing the resulting permuted state function from the original\nunpermuted one by means of any observation at any time.\n\n\n(The state function of quantum mechanics determines the probability of\nmeasurement results. Hence what the Indistinguishability Postulate\nexpresses is that a particle permutation does not lead to any\ndifference in the probabilities for measurement outcomes.) \n\n\nThe argument then continues as follows: that a permutation of the\nparticles is counted as giving a different arrangement in classical\nstatistical mechanics implies that, although they are\nindistinguishable, such particles can be regarded as individuals\n(indeed, Boltzmann himself made this explicit in the first axiom of\nhis \u2018Lectures on Mechanics\u2019, couched in terms of the\nimpenetrability assumption noted above). Since this individuality\nresides in something over and above the intrinsic properties of the\nparticles in terms of which they can be regarded as indistinguishable,\nit has been called \u2018Transcendental Individuality\u2019 by Post\n(1963).  This notion can be cashed out in various well-known ways, as\nindicated in the Introduction above: in terms of some kind of\nunderlying Lockean substance, for example, or in terms\nof primitive thisness. More generally, one might\napproach it in modal fashion, through the doctrine of haecceitism:\nthis asserts that two possible worlds may describe some individual in\nqualitatively the same way (that is, as possessing the same set of\nproperties), yet represent that individual differently by ascribing a\ndifferent haecceity or thisness in each world, or more generally, by\nascribing some non-qualitative aspect to the individual (Lewis 1986;\nHuggett 1999a).\n\n\nConversely, it is argued, if such permutations are not counted in\nquantum statistics, it follows that quantum objects cannot be\nregarded as individuals in any of these senses (Post 1963). In\nother words, they are very different from most everyday\nobjects in that they are \u2018non-individuals\u2019, in some\nsense.\n\n\nThis radical metaphysical conclusion can be traced back to the\nreflections of Born and Heisenberg themselves and was further\nelaborated in the very earliest discussions of the foundations of\nquantum physics. As Weyl put it in his classic text on group theory\nand quantum mechanics:\n\u2026 the possibility that one of the identical twins\nMike and Ike is in the quantum state E1 and the other in the quantum\nstate E2 does not include two differentiable cases which are permuted\non permuting Mike and Ike; it is impossible for either of these\nindividuals to retain his identity so that one of them will always be\nable to say \u2018I\u2019m Mike\u2019 and the other \u2018I\u2019m Ike.\u2019\nEven in principle one cannot demand an alibi of an electron! (Weyl\n1931)\n\n\nRecalling the discussion sketched in the Introduction, if we were to\ncreate a twin using some kind of Star trek replicator, say, then in the\nclassical domain such a twin could insist that \u2018I\u2019m here and\nshe\u2019s there\u2019 or, more generally, \u2018I\u2019m in this state and\nshe\u2019s in that one\u2019 and \u2018swapping us over makes a\ndifference\u2019. In the classical domain each (indistinguishable)\ntwin has a metaphysical \u2018alibi\u2019 grounded in their\nindividuality. Weyl\u2019s point is that in quantum mechanics, they do not. \n",
