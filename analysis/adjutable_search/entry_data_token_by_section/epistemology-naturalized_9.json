    "main_text": "Epistemology as \u201cThoroughly Empirical\u201d || Epistemic Normativity\n4.2 Epistemic Normativity\n\nWhile Kornblith thus denies that epistemology is to be replaced by\nsome other discipline(s) (replacement NE), it is perhaps less clear\nwhat becomes of the normativity of epistemology on\nhis view. Unlike Quine as he is standardly\ninterpreted\u2014but as appears to be Quine\u2019s view in\nlater writings\u2014Kornblith is \u201cquite sympathetic with the\nsuggestion that the normative dimension of epistemological inquiry is\nessential to it\u201d (Kornblith 1995: 250). And Kornblith, like\nreliabilists generally, portrays truth (true belief) as the epistemic\ngoal\u2014much as Quine, in describing his view of the normative\ndimension of epistemology\n (Section 3),\n presumes that truth (or prediction) is \u201cthe terminal\nparameter\u201d. But how is that fact established, such that a\n\u201cthoroughly empirical\u201d (1995: 250) epistemology can, after\nall, retain the normative dimension of TE?\n\nOne response to this question is that epistemic norms have a\n\u201cpractical grounding\u201d (Kornblith 1993b, 2002). While it is\ncompatible with the possible intrinsic value of true belief (Kornblith\n2002: 161, 373), such an account features its instrumental value.\nImportantly, however, the argument is not cast (just) in terms of the\ninstrumental value of individual true beliefs; the central claim,\nrather, is that everyone \u201chas pragmatic reasons to favor a\ncognitive system which is effective in generating truths\u201d (2002:\n156). This point can perhaps be best illustrated by considering an\nalternative naturalistic account of the source of epistemic\nnormativity\u2014the \u201cpragmatist\u201d account favored by\nStephen Stich (1990, 1993).\n\nAccording to Stich, there is nothing special about truth, and no\nreason to take it to be the epistemic goal. In fact, for pragmatists,\nthere are no special cognitive or epistemological values at\nall\u2014\u201c[t]here are just values\u201d (1993: 9). Good\nreasoning is a matter of effectively promoting your goals (what\nyou value), whatever they are. Stich says that, \u201cthe\npragmatist project for assessing reasoning\u201d proceeds by\ndetermining one\u2019s goals\u2014what one wants to\nachieve\u2014and then identifying the reasoning strategies that\nothers have successfully employed in achieving those same goals\n(ibid: 9\u201310). However, it is hard to see how this is to\nbe done unless one has some reliable cognitive systems or strategies\nin place. That is, even if happiness, say, rather than true belief, is\nwhat one really values, in order to effectively pursue that goal one\nwill need some way of determining how best to achieve it. One will\nneed, that is, a (reasonably) reliable cognitive system\u2014or, to\nput it in more traditional terms, one will need some reliable\nfaculties. Further,\n\n\n[p]recisely because our cognitive systems are required to perform\nevaluations relative to our many concerns, and to perform these\nevaluations accurately, the standards by which we evaluate these\ncognitive systems themselves must remain insulated from most of what\nwe intrinsically value, whatever we may value. (Kornblith 2002:\n158)\n\n\nSo, whatever else one cares about, one has an interest in\u2014one\nshould care about\u2014having a cognitive system (or systems) that\nproduces true beliefs reliably; and one has an interest in\u2014a reason\nto care about\u2014evaluating, not just individual beliefs, but our\nvarious systems and methods for producing them, in terms of their\nreliability. \u201cAnd this\u201d, as Kornblith says, \u201cis\nprecisely what epistemic evaluation is all about. Truth plays a\npre-eminent role here\u201d (2002: 158).\n\nWhether one finds the preceding account of the grounding of epistemic\nnormativity satisfactory will depend largely upon how one conceives of\nepistemic normativity, even normativity generally, to begin with. For\nexample, the above argument seems to rely upon the instrumental or\nmeans-end norm. Speaking of his own view, which is in this respect\nsimilar to Kornblith\u2019s, Maffie says: \n\n\nepistemology is normative only within the framework of instrumental\nreason and\u2026its normativity is parasitic upon that of the\nlatter. (1990b: 333) \n\n\nThere is debate, however, about the nature and status of instrumental\nreason, as well as about whether a reliance upon it should be acceptable\nto a naturalist. (See, e.g., Hampton 1992, Dreier 2001, Siegel\n 1990;[17]\n for general discussion, see Wallace 2014.) So too, some philosophers\nregard epistemic norms as categorical\u2014as binding on any rational\nagent, regardless of the goals or desires which s/he happens to have\n(Kelly 2003: 616, 621). Now, there are no specific goals or\ndesires that one must have in order to be so bound, according to\nKornblith: his argument requires only that one have some\ngoals. Since this condition is fulfilled in all normal humans the\nhypothetical norm\u2014\u201cIf you have some desire or goal you\nwish to satisfy or attain, seek the truth\u201d\u2014is in\neffect a categorical one (it is \u201cuniversal\u201d, as\nKornblith puts it; 2002: 161). However, some may find even this still\ntoo contingent a ground upon which to base epistemic norms. (Compare\nHusserl\u2019s and Frege\u2019s concerns about the intrusion of\npsychology into logic and mathematics;\n Section 1.3.)\n Others, on the other hand, may doubt whether TE itself has ever been\nable to provide any entirely unconditional recommendations (e.g.,\nGrandy 1994: 345). And Kornblith, like other naturalists, is bound to\nquestion whether attempting to understand epistemic normativity while\nsetting aside such obvious and inescapable facts as that we do have\ngoals and desires is likely to yield any useful insight into our\nactual epistemic situation (see, e.g., Kornblith 1995: 251, and Wrenn\n2006: 73, commenting on Goldman 1986).[18]\n",
