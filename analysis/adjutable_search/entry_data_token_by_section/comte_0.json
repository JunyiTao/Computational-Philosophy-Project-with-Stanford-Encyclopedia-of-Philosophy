Introduction\n\nIt is difficult today to appreciate the interest Comte\u2019s thought\nenjoyed a century ago, for it has received almost no notice during the\nlast five decades. Before the First World War, Comte\u2019s movement\nwas active nearly everywhere in the world (Pl\u00e9 1996; Simon\n1963). The best known case is that of Latin America: Brazil, which\nowes the motto on its flag \u2018Ordem e Progresso\u2019 (Order and\nProgress) to Comte (Trindade 2003), and Mexico (Hale 1989) are two\nprominent examples. The positivists, i.e., the followers of Comte,\nwere equally active in England (Wright 1986), the United States\n(Cashdollars 1989; Harp 1994) and India (Forbes 1975). And in the case\nof Turkey, its modern secular character can be traced to Comte\u2019s\ninfluence on the Young Turks.\n\nNone of this activity survived the First World War. The new balance of\npower created by the Russian Revolution left no room for positive\npolity, and Comtean positivism was taken over by neo-positivism in\nphilosophy of science. The term \u2018post-positivism\u2019, used in\nthe second half of the 20th century, demonstrates the complete\ndisappearance of what one might call, in retrospect,\n\u201cpaleo-positivism\u201d. As a matter of fact, post-positivism\nis a kind of \u201cpost-neo-positivism\u201d, since the well-known\ncriticisms launched by Kuhn and Feyerabend were directed at\nCarnap\u2019s neopositivism, not Comte\u2019s positivism, about\nwhich they seem to have known very little. This shows that their use\nof \u201cpositivism\u201d forgets totally Comte, who is nevertheless\nthe man who coined the term. Moreover, in a number of cases, the\npost-positivists simply rediscovered points that were well established\nin paleo-positivism (such as the need to take into account the context\nof justification and the social dimension of science) but subsequently\nforgotten.\n\nThis unexpected agreement between the paleo- and post-positivists\nshows that there is some enduring substance to Comte\u2019s original\nthinking and partially explains why Comtean studies have seen a strong\nrevival of late (Bourdeau 2018, Schmaus 2021). Philosophers and\nsociologists have begun to draw attention to the interesting views\ndefended over a century and a half ago by the founder of positivism.\nIt thus seems that the eclipse of the original positivism is nearing\nits end.\n\nOne quickly notices the gap between the meaning that\n\u2018positivism\u2019 had for Comte in the 19th century and the\nmeaning that it has come to have in our times. Thus, contrary to what\nis usually thought, Comte\u2019s positivism is not a philosophy of\nscience but a political philosophy. Or, if one prefers, Comte\u2019s\npositivism is a remarkable philosophy that doesn\u2019t separate\nphilosophy of science from political philosophy. The title of what\nComte always regarded as his seminal work (written in 1822 when he was\nonly 24 years old) leaves no doubt as to the bond between science and\npolitics: it is Plan for the Scientific Work Necessary to\nReorganize Society, also called First System of Positive\nPolity. Its goal is the reorganization of society. Science gets\ninvolved only after politics, when Comte suggests calling in\nscientists to achieve that goal. So, while science plays a central\nrole in positive polity, positivism is anything but a blind admiration\nfor science. From 1847, positivism is placed under the\n\u2018continuous dominance of the heart\u2019 (la\npr\u00e9ponderance continue du coeur), and the motto\n\u2018Order and Progress\u2019 becomes \u2018Love as principle,\norder as basis, progress as end\u2019 (L\u2019amour pour\nprincipe, l\u2019ordre pour base et le progr\u00e8s pour but).\nThis turn, unexpected for many of his contemporaries, was in fact well\nmotivated and is characteristic of the very dynamics of Comte\u2019s\nthought.\n\nThe \u2018complete positivism\u2019 of what Comte himself called his\n\u2018second career\u2019 has on the whole been judged severely.\nVery quickly, the most famous admirers of the early Course of\nPositive Philosophy (1830\u20131842), such as Mill and\nLittr\u00e9, disavowed the author of the later System of\nPositive Polity (1851\u20131854), thereby giving substance to\nthe idea that there is a good and a bad Comte. Nevertheless, if his\nearly writings call for a revision of the standard interpretation of\npositivism, this is even more the case for the works of his\n\u2018second career\u2019.\n\nFrom these introductory remarks, some of the main threads of what\nfollows can already be seen. First, whatever the exact worth of the\ntwo groups of writings that surround it may be, the Course of\nPositive Philosophy (hereafter Course) remains\nComte\u2019s major contribution. Second, an interpretation of the\nwhole of Comte\u2019s work is confronted with two problems. The first\nproblem concerns the unity of Comte\u2019s thought: do the first and\nthe second career form a continuum, or is there a break? The second\nproblem concerns Comte\u2019s relationship to Saint-Simon (see below\n3.2.): is the founder of positivism merely one Saint-Simonian among\nothers, as Durkheim maintained, or should one, as Gouhier (1933)\nproposed, follow Comte himself, who on this matter spoke of a\n\u2018disastrous contact\u2019 that had, at best, merely hindered\nhis \u2018spontaneous development\u2019 (1830 (56), v. 2,\n 466)?[1].\n\nAs an approach to Comte\u2019s philosophy, the chronological order\nseems the most appropriate guide. After a quick review of some\nbiographical facts, we will deal first with the Saint-Simonian period\nand the early writings, and then with the two great works that stand\nout: the Course of Positive Philosophy (six volumes,\n1830\u20131842), and the System of Positive Polity (four\nvolumes, 1851\u20131854).\n",
