    "main_text": "Critical reactions to Lewis\n4. Critical reactions to Lewis\n\n\nMost subsequent discussions take Lewis\u2019s analysis as a starting point,\nif only as a foil for motivating some alternative. Many philosophers\nsimply help themselves to Lewis\u2019s account without modifying it. On the\nother hand, virtually every element of Lewis\u2019s account has attracted\ncriticism during the past few decades. For instance, Ken Binmore\n(2008) and Richard Moore (2013) attack the \u201ccommon\nknowledge\u201d condition in Lewis\u2019s analysis. In this section, we\nwill review some prominent criticisms of Lewis\u2019s account.\n",
