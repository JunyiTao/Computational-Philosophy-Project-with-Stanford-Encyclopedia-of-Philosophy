    "main_text": "Life and work\n1. Life and work\n\nHusserl was born in Prossnitz (Moravia) on April 8th, 1859.\nHis parents were non-orthodox Jews; Husserl himself and his wife would\nlater convert to Protestantism. They had three children, one of whom\ndied in World War I. In the years 1876\u201378 Husserl studied\nastronomy in Leipzig, where he also attended courses of lectures in\nmathematics, physics and philosophy. Among other things, he heard\nWilhelm Wundt\u2019s lectures on philosophy. (Wundt was the\noriginator of the first institute for experimental psychology.)\nHusserl\u2019s mentor was Thomas Masaryk, a former student of\nBrentano\u2019s, who was later to become the first president of\nCzechoslovakia. In 1878\u201381 Husserl continued his studies in\nmathematics, physics and philosophy in Berlin. His mathematics\nteachers there included Leopold Kronecker and Karl Weierstrass, whose\nscientific ethos Husserl was particularly impressed with. However, he\ntook his PhD in mathematics in Vienna (January 1883), with a thesis on\nthe theory of variations (Variationstheorie). After that he\nreturned to Berlin, to become Weierstrass\u2019 assistant. When\nWeierstrass got seriously ill, Masaryk suggested that Husserl go back\nto Vienna, to study philosophy with Franz Brentano, the author of\nPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874). After a brief\nmilitary service in Vienna, Husserl followed Masaryk\u2019s advice\nand studied with Brentano from 1884\u201386. Brentano\u2019s\nlectures on psychology and logic had a lasting impact on Husserl, as\nhad his general vision of a strictly scientific philosophy. Brentano\nthen recommended Husserl to his pupil Carl Stumpf in Halle, who is\nperhaps best known for his Psychology of Tone (two volumes,\n1883/90). This recommendation enabled Husserl to prepare and submit\nhis habilitation dissertation On the Concept of Number (1887)\nwith Stumpf.\n\nThat thesis was later integrated into Husserl\u2019s first published\nmonograph, Philosophy of Arithmetic, which appeared in 1891.\nIn this work, Husserl combined his mathematical, psychological and\nphilosophical competencies to attempt a psychological foundation of\narithmetic (see Willard 1984, pp. 38\u2013118; Bell 1990, pp.\n31\u201384). The book was, however, criticized for its underlying\npsychologism in a review by Gottlob Frege. It seems that Husserl took\nthat criticism very seriously (see F\u00f8llesdal 1958), although it\nis far from clear that the author of Philosophy of Arithmetic\nregards logic as a branch of psychology, as \u201cstrong\npsychologism\u201d (Mohanty 1982, p. 20) has it. In any case, Husserl\nsharply attacked that kind of psychologism (raising about eighteen\nobjections in total; see Soldati 1994, pp. 117 ff) and developed the\nphilosophical method he is nowadays famous for: phenomenology.\n\nIn 1900/01 his first phenomenological work was published in two\nvolumes, titled Logical Investigations. The first volume\ncontains a forceful attack against psychologism, whereas the (much\nlarger) second volume consists of six\n\u201cdescriptive-psychological\u201d and\n\u201cepistemological\u201d investigations into (I) expression and\nmeaning, (II) universals, (III) the formal ontology of parts and\nwholes (mereology), (IV) the \u201csyntactical\u201d and\nmereological structure of meaning, (V) the nature and structure of\nintentionality as well as (VI) the interrelation of truth, intuition\nand cognition. Husserl now adheres to a version of platonism that he\nderived from ideas of Hermann Lotze and especially Bernard Bolzano,\nwhere he embeds platonism about meaning and mental content in a theory\nof intentional consciousness (see Beyer 1996).\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, Husserl\nconsiderably refined and modified his method into what he called\n\u201ctranscendental phenomenology\u201d. This method has us focus\non the essential structures that allow the objects naively taken for\ngranted in the \u201cnatural attitude\u201d (which is characteristic\nof both our everyday life and ordinary science) to \u201cconstitute\nthemselves\u201d in consciousness. (Among those who influenced him in\nthis regard are Descartes, Hume and Kant.) As Husserl explains in\ndetail in his second major work, Ideas (1913), the resulting\nperspective on the realm of intentional consciousness is supposed to\nenable the phenomenologist to develop a radically unprejudiced\njustification of his (or her) basic views on the world and himself and\nexplore their rational interconnections.\n\nHusserl developed these ideas in G\u00f6ttingen, where\u2014thanks to\nhis Logical Investigations and the support by Wilhelm\nDilthey, who admired that work and recommended Husserl to the Prussian\nministry of culture\u2014he received an associate professorship\n(\u201cExtraordinariat\u201d, later turned into a\n\u201cPers\u00f6nliches Ordinariat\u201d) in 1901. From 1910/11 and\n1913, respectively, he served as founding (co-)editor of\nLogos (in the first issue of which his programmatic article\n\u201cPhilosophy as a Rigorous Science\u201d appeared, containing a\ncritique of naturalism) and of the Yearbook for Phenomenology and\nPhenomenological Research (opening with his Ideas Pertaining\nto a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy).\nHusserl stayed in G\u00f6ttingen until 1916. It is here that he made\nhis most important philosophical discoveries (cf. Mohanty 1995), such\nas the transcendental-phenomenological method, the phenomenological\nstructure of time-consciousness, the fundamental role of the notion of\nintersubjectivity in our conceptual system, the horizon-structure of\nour singular empirical thought, and more. In later works\u2014most\nnotably in On the Phenomenology of the Consciousness of Internal\nTime (1928), Formal and Transcendental Logic (1929),\nCartesian Meditations (1931), The Crisis of European\nSciences and Transcendental Phenomenology (1954) and\nExperience and Judgement (1939)\u2014these results were\ndeveloped further and put into new contexts, such as the path-breaking\nproject of linking the basic notions of science back to their\nconceptual roots in the pre-scientific (regions of the)\n\u201clifeworld\u201d (Crisis).\n\nIn the year 1916 Husserl became Heinrich Rickert\u2019s successor as\nfull professor (\u201cOrdinarius\u201d) in Freiburg/Breisgau, where\n(among many other things) he worked on passive synthesis (cf.\nHusserliana, vol. XI, XXXI). He gave four lectures on\nPhenomenological Method and Phenomenological Philosophy at\nUniversity College, London, in 1922 (cf. Husserliana, vol.\nXXXV). In 1923 he received a call to Berlin, which he rejected.\nHusserl retired in 1928, his successor being his (and Rickert\u2019s)\nformer assistant Martin Heidegger (whose major work Being and\nTime had been published in Husserl\u2019s Yearbook in\n1927). In 1929 he accepted an invitation to Paris. His lectures there\nwere published as Cartesian Meditations in 1931. In the same\nyear, Husserl gave a number of talks on \u201cPhenomenology and\nAnthropology\u201d, in which he criticized his two\n\u201cantipodes\u201d, Heidegger and Max Scheler (cf. Husserl 1997).\nIn 1933 Hitler took over in Germany. Husserl received a call to Los\nAngeles but rejected. Because of his Jewish ancestors, he became more\nand more humiliated and isolated. In 1935 he gave a series of invited\nlectures in Prague, resulting in his last major work, The Crisis\nof European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology.\n\nEdmund Husserl died on April 27, 1938 in Freiburg. His manuscripts\n(more than 40000 pages in total) were rescued by the Franciscan Herman\nLeo Van Breda, who brought them to Leuven (Belgium), where the first\nHusserl archive was founded in 1939. (Today, there are further\narchives in Freiburg, Cologne, Paris, New York and Pittsburgh.) Since\n1950 the Husserl archives are editing Husserl\u2019s collected works,\nHusserliana.\n",
