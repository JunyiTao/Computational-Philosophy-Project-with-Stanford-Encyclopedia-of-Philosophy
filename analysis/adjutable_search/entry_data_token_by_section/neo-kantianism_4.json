    "main_text": "The Marburg School || Philosophy of Natural Science\n2.3 Philosophy of Natural Science\n\nThe Marburg philosophers wrote several works that engaged in a\ndetailed way with the natural science, especially physics, of their\nday. In his Forward and Introduction to the sixth edition of\nLange\u2019s History of Materialism, first published in\n1898, Cohen gives a philosophical interpretation of work on\nelectromagnetism since Faraday, and defends Hertz\u2019s\nPrinciples of Mechanics (Hertz 1894). In two works both\npublished in 1910 (Natorp 1910: Ch.7; Cassirer 1910: Ch.4) Natorp and\nCassirer discuss foundational issues in physics: the principles of\nmechanics and thermodynamics; the nature of mass, energy, space, and\ntime; atomism and its critics. (Cassirer also addresses foundational\nissues in chemistry: 1910: Ch.4, section 8). The culmination of this\nwork is Cassirer\u2019s Einstein\u2019s Theory of\nRelativity, published in 1921.\n\nThere are three themes that run through Marburg work in the philosophy\nof natural science: they argue that contemporary natural science\nsupports philosophical idealism; they highlight radical conceptual\nchanges in physics; and they philosophically interpret physics in the\nlight of their conception of objective validity. Each of\nthese themes is discussed in the rest of the section.\nIdealism in Natural Science\n\nOne of Cohen\u2019s chief goals in Cohen 1898 is to show that recent\nwork in electromagnetism undermines \u201csensualism\u201d or\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d, and supports \u201cidealism\u201d, by\ntransforming our conception of physical reality away from the\n\u201csensible\u201d and \u201cmaterial\u201d to the\n\u201cideal\u201d. The physical world, according to the\n\u201csensible\u201d conception of reality\u2014the way the world\nappears to us to be through our senses\u2014is composed of matter,\nconceived on the model of the roughly medium sized dry goods that our\nsenses reveal to us. Physicists working in\nelectromagnetism\u2014Cohen points to Faraday\nespecially\u2014demonstrated the physical reality of electromagnetic\nfields. Following Faraday, Cohen applauds efforts to treat\nelectromagnetic fields and forces as independent entities in their own\nright, not dependent on a \u201cmaterial\u201d ether. Pure field\ntheories thus vindicate idealism, by showing that our conception of\nthe objects of physics should not be constrained by the picture of the\nworld supplied by our senses; our conception of the world can only be\nsupplied by thought, and not by the senses.\n\nGiven Cohen\u2019s opposition to ether theories, it is not surprising\nthat he feels vindicated by Einstein\u2019s special theory of\nrelativity (Cohen 1898: 134; the passage appears in 1914\u20135\nedition). In fact, Cassirer claims (1921: Ch.4) that Einstein\u2019s\ngeneral theory, which departs further from the \u201csensible\u201d\nconception of matter by not separating matter from space and time, is\na natural continuation of the idealism Cohen first articulated. \nRadical Conceptual Change in Natural Science\n\nAccording to the Marburg transcendental method\n (section 2.1),\n the \u201cfact\u201d of science is not static, but dynamic. In\nadvocating this method, the Marburg Neo-Kantians are thus claiming\nthat the principles that are a priori for science will evolve as\ntheories change, and the concepts that function as categories will be\nradically reconceived as science progresses. There is then a new task,\nto identify the principles that are a priori in a given physical\ntheory, and to investigate how the categories\u2014space, time,\nsubstance, magnitude\u2014are being reconceived in our current best\nphysical theories. The Marburgers are thus committed to a view of\nscientific progress that emphasizes conceptual shifts in science.\nScientists don\u2019t just discover new facts: they also develop new\nconcepts, and radically revise their fundamental concepts.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Marburg conception of objectivity and\nobjecthood, objecthood\u2014what it is to be an object\u2014is\nconceptually dependent on objectivity, which is explained in terms of\nlaws. The upshot of this is that our notion of a physical object is\ndetermined by the most fundamental laws of our science. Marburg\nNeo-Kantianism therefore highlights the fact that scientific progress\nrequires fundamental shifts in science\u2019s ontology\u2014its\nconception of what there is.\n\nThese themes are apparent already in Cohen\u2019s introduction to\nLange (Cohen 1898). Following Hertz, Cohen surveys three different\nproposals for the principles of mechanics: Newton\u2019s view (which\ntakes as fundamental space, time, mass, and force); an alternative\nthat replaces the notion of force with energy; and Hertz\u2019s own\nradical view, which uses only the notions of space, time, and mass.\nCohen argues for Hertz\u2019s view, emphasizing how it fundamentally\nreconceptualizes the traditional notion of \u201cmass\u201d (Cohen\n1898: 128ff.). This same tendency is even more apparent in\nCassirer\u2019s writings on Einstein. He argues that Einstein\nintroduces new a priori principles: the constancy of the speed of\nlight (in the special theory), and the principles of general\ncovariance and the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass (in\nthe general theory) (1921: 415, 428). And he emphasizes the\ntransformations in the notions of substance, space, and time that the\ngeneral theory requires (1921: Chs.\n 3\u20135).[13]\nObjective Validity of Natural Science\n\nFor Marburg Neo-Kantianism, objectivity and objecthood are explained\nin terms of the unity of knowledge. Explaining the unity of scientific\nknowledge over time becomes especially pressing for them given their\nemphasis on radical conceptual change in natural science. If even the\ncategories are shifting over time, in what sense is there unity to our\nknowledge?\n\nThis problem is made more pressing in conjunction with the Marburg\nattack on the given. (After all, if there were something given in\nexperience, then the given in experience would determine which\nconceptual changes are necessary in science, and the objectivity of\nour scientific knowledge could be explained.) In the philosophy of\nscience, the attack on the given amounts to an attack on the\npossibility of crucial experiments\u2014experiments that would, in a\ntheory neutral way, establish the truth of a scientific theory.\nMarburg philosophers emphasized that even the most primitive\nexperimental results\u2014measurements\u2014presuppose a good amount\nof \u201ctheoretical\u201d machinery: not only mathematics, but even\nphysical laws. Cassirer cited Duhem in support (1910: Ch.4). Duhemian\nunderdetermination of scientific theory by experience showed, Cassirer\nbelieved, that there is no given: no autonomous layer of\nself-authenticating experiences.\n\nMarburg philosophy of science thus includes the claim that there could\nbe rival scientific theories, each of which is empirically\n adequate.[14]\n Given this, in what sense is science objective? How is there unity in\nscience, when there are no theory-neutral experiments that would\nprevent different scientists from adopting different theories?\nCassirer (1910) in particular proposed an intricate answer to this\nquestion (Heis 2014). He argued that there is a common set of demands\non theories that will constrain the choice of theory. These demands\nare a priori, in a regulative sense, and partially constitute what he\ncalls the \u201cform\u201d of a scientific theory. These demands\ninclude that a theory be simple and of wide\n scope.[15]\n He also argues that even in the face of radical conceptual changes\nand shifts in ontology, some features of scientific theories are\nmaintained\u2014for instance the approximate mathematical structure\nof the theory.\n\nFor further discussion of the philosophy of mathematics, see the\nSupplement,\n Philosophy of Mathematics in the Marburg School.\n",
