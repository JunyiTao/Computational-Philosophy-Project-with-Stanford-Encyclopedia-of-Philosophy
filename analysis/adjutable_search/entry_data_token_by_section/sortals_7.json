    "main_text": "Substance sortals\n4. Substance sortals\n\nThe sortals that Wiggins regards as crucial, the substance sortals,\nare a proper subset of the ones Strawson is concerned with.\nSubstance sortals contrast with phase sortals; the\nlatter typically only apply to some temporal segment of an object.\nKitten is a phase sortal because when a cat matures it ceases to be a\nkitten but it does not go out of existence. Substance sortals are also\ncontrasted with restricted sortals, e.g., \u201cred table\u201d.\nWiggins has a detailed theory of the structure of substance sortals,\narguing that if any two substance sortals overlap, then either one is\na restriction of the other or both are restrictions of some other\nsortal.\n\nThis seems problematic because it is plausible that plant and animal\nare both substance sortals. While they do not overlap, another\ncandidate for being a substance sortal carnivore overlaps\nboth. This would probably not disturb Wiggins, since he already denies\nthat \u201canimal\u201d is a substance sortal.\n\n\nIt is not to be denied that the words \u201cthis animal\u201d\nsuffice to express a rough and ready identification in ordinary\ncontexts of what things are. But this is because \u201canimal\u201d\nso easily takes on an individuative force from a context and/or some\nother sortal predicate that is ready to hand. But the designation\n\u201cthis animal\u201d is complemented in all sorts of\ndifferent ways. In itself it determines no single principle\nof individuation. (2001: 129)\n\n\nWe said earlier that in contrast with Strawson, Wiggins is concerned\nprimarily with the narrower class of substance sortals. Yet if we read\nhis account carefully, it emerges that in the end individuation rests\nwith an even smaller class which he calls\n\u201cultimate\u201d sortals:\n\n\nBy an ultimate sortal I mean a sortal which either itself restricts no\nother sortal or else has a sense which both yields necessary and\nsufficient conditions of persistence for the kind it defines and is\nsuch that this sense can be clearly fixed and fully explained without\nreference to any other sortal which restricts it. (1967: 32)\n\n\u2026I shall call x\u2019s ultimate sortal concept\n\u2026 the sortal concept which is individuative of x and\nrestricts no other sortal concept. (1980: 65)\n\n\nThe idea is that \u201ccat\u201d and \u201cdog\u201d may both be\nindividuated by the same criterion, so the fundamental criterion is\nnot only associated with them but with other substance sortals that\nfall under the same ultimate sortal. We know from Wiggins\u2019s\nremarks that \u201canimal\u201d is not a sortal, so the ultimate\nsortal for \u201ccat\u201d and \u201cdog\u201d is somewhere in the\nhierarchy above those concepts but below \u201canimal\u201d.\nSurprisingly, given the centrality of this notion, Wiggins nowhere\ngives an example of what he regards as an ultimate sortal. (At 1980:\n123 he does speculate inconclusively that \u201cman\u201d might be\nthe ultimate sortal for Julius Caesar.)\n\nWithout more specificity about when principles of individuation are\nthe same and different, the foundation of Wiggins\u2019s account is\nmurky. For example, we don\u2019t have enough information to\ndetermine whether some middle level term such as \u201cmammal\u201d\nis an ultimate sortal or not.\n\nThere are also other problems. Wiggins recognizes that his account of\nindividuation of biological kinds in terms of \u201ccharacteristic\nforms of activity\u201d does not transfer well to prototypical\nartifacts. He tries to meet this concern by giving an analysis in\nterms of function for artifacts such as clocks. However, he seems to\nassume that there are not problematic intermediate cases between\nnatural kinds and pure artifacts. Many kinds of things, e.g., rivers\nand lakes, can be either natural or artificial. They can also be\npartly artificial, as when a river is dredged or a lake enlarged. Nevertheless, Wiggins (2016, chap. 16, sec. 16\u201317, and chap. 12) might provide criteria for deciding upon these cases. (See Carrara & Vermass (2009), Baker (2004, 2008), and Losonsky (1990), for critical discussions on Wiggins\u2019 view on artifacts; see also the entry  on artifacts for more general discussions of this notion in diverse areas of philosophy.)\n\nMoreover, in his own favorite cases of biology, he remarks:\n\n\nAlmost everything that has been said so far has been mainly directed\nat words standing for the various species of natural substances. The\naccount could be extended and adapted without overwhelming difficulty\nto predicates of genera, wherever these were still determinate enough\nto be autonomously individuative. (2001: 86)\n\n\nUnfortunately, his own favorite examples, \u201celm\u201d borrowed\nfrom Putnam (1975) and \u201cfrog\u201d are not terms for species.\n\u201cElm\u201d is a genus and \u201cfrog\u201d an order. In fact,\na quick consultation with a good dictionary will reveal that most\ncommonly used biological terms are expressions for some classification\nabove the level of species. Since Wiggins is cautious about extending\nhis account to genera, he may have very few substance sortals by his\naccount.\n\nYet another problem for species as the model of sortals is that most\nphilosophers of biology now agree that species don\u2019t have\nessences, though there is disagreement among them about the best way\nto characterize species (for details, see the entry on species). A rejection of species essentialism doesn\u2019t necessarily carry a rejection of the essentialism Wiggins has advocated. His is individual essentialism, i.e., the view that an individual is essentially a member of the species it belongs to (Wiggins 2001, chap. 4). Thus, a given whale, for example, is essentially a member of the species whales; this even in the case where there is no essential property such a species possesses. Moreover, there are attempts by Wiggins to argue that species don\u2019t have essences. He states, for example, that species is an:\n\n\n\u2026insecure concept in plant-taxonomy, and threatened even in\nzoology by such phenomena as ring-species and the imperfect\ntransitivity of the relation interbreeds in the wild with\u2014the\noperational test of identity of species. (1967: 62)\n\n\nThere is no incoherence here on Wiggins\u2019 part because species essentialism is logically independent of individual essentialism. Nevertheless, Wiggins\u2019 essentialism is, like species essentialism, also subject to criticism based on contemporary results from the philosophy of biology (Laporte 1997 and Okasha 2000). But see Ferner (2016) for a sympathetic discussion of Wiggins\u2019 doctrines from the perspective of biology, and Devitt (2018) for a recent defense of individual essentialism, which considers the views and criticism in question.\n",
