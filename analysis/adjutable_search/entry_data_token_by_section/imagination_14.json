    "main_text": "Roles of Imagination || Engagement with the Arts\n3.4 Engagement with the Arts\n\nThere is an entrenched historical connection between imagination and\nthe arts. David Hume and Immanuel Kant both invoke imagination\ncentrally in their exploration of aesthetic phenomena (albeit in\nradically different ways; see entries on\n Hume\u2019s aesthetics\n and\n Kant\u2019s aesthetics).\n R.G. Collingwood (1938) defines art as the imaginative expression of\nfeeling (Wiltsher 2018; see entry on\n Collingwood\u2019s aesthetics).\n Roger Scruton (1974) develops a Wittgensteinian account of\nimagination and accords it a central role in aesthetic experience and\naesthetic judgment.\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, the most prominent theory of\nimagination\u2019s role in engagement with the arts is presented in\nKendall Walton\u2019s Mimesis as Make-Believe (1990).\n(Although Walton uses \u201cfictions\u201d as a technical term to\nrefer to artworks, his conception of the arts is broad enough to\ninclude both high-brow and low-brow; popular and obscure; a variety of\nspecific arts such as poetry and videogames; and\u2014as Stacie\nFriend (2008) clarifies\u2014both fictive and non-fictive works.)\nWalton\u2019s core insight is that engagement with the arts is\nfundamentally similar to children\u2019s games of make-believe. When\none engages with an artwork, one uses it as a prop in a make-believe\ngame. As props, artworks generate prescriptions for imaginings. These\nprescriptions also determine the representational contents of artworks\n(that is, \u201cfictionality\u201d, or what is true in a fictional\nworld). When one correctly engages with an artwork, then, one imagines\nthe representational contents as prescribed.\n\nOut of all the arts, it is the engagement with narratives that\nphilosophers have explored most closely in conjunction with\nimagination (see Stock 2013 for an overview). Gregory Currie (1990)\noffers an influential account of imagination and fiction, and Peter\nLamarque and Stein Haugom Olsen (1996) discuss literature\nspecifically. Indeed, this research program\u2014despite many\ncriticisms of Walton\u2019s specific theory\u2014remains lively\ntoday (see, for example, papers in Nichols (ed.) 2006b). For example, Kathleen Stock (2017) argues that a specific kind of propositional imagination is essential for engagement with fictions. In dissent, Derek Matravers (2014) argues that, contra Walton, imagination is not essential for engagement with fictions. \n\nPhilosophers have also done much to articulate the connection between\nimagination and engagement with music (see the entry on\n philosophy of music;\n see also Trivedi 2011). Some philosophers focus on commonalities\nbetween engagement with narratives and engagement with music. For\nexample, even though Walton (1990, 1994a, 1999) acknowledges that\nfictional worlds of music are much more indeterminate than fictional\nworlds of narratives, he maintains that the same kind of imagining\nused in experiencing narratives is also used in experiencing various\nelements of music, such as imagining continuity between movements and\nimagining feeling musical tension. Similarly, Andrew Kania (2015)\nargues that experiencing musical space and movement is imaginative\nlike our experience of fictional narratives. Other philosophers draw\nparallels between engagement with music and other imaginative\nactivities, namely as understanding other minds\n (section 3.1)\n and interpreting metaphor\n (section 3.7).\n As an example of the former, Jerrold Levinson (1996) argues that the\nbest explanation of musical expressiveness requires listeners to\nexperience music imaginatively\u2014specifically, imagining a persona\nexpressing emotions through the music. As an example of the latter,\nScruton (1997) argues that musical experience is informed by spatial\nconcepts applied metaphorically, and so imaginative perception is\nnecessary for musical understanding (but see Budd 2003 for a\ncriticism; see also De Clercq 2007 and Kania 2015). Stephen Davies\n(2005, 2011) and Peter Kivy (2002) notably criticize the imaginative\naccounts of engagement with music on empirical and theoretical\ngrounds.\n\nOther imaginative accounts of engagement with the arts can be found in entries on\n philosophy of film\n and\n philosophy of dance. \nIndeed, imagination\u2019s aesthetic significance extends beyond the\narts; philosophical aestheticians have recognized the role of\nimagination in appreciating nature (Brady 1998) and in appreciating\nmundane objects, events, and activities (see the entry\non aesthetics of the everyday).\n\nPhilosophers have sought to clarify the role of imagination in\nengagement with the arts by focusing on a number of puzzles and\nparadoxes in the vicinity. The puzzle of imaginative\nresistance explores apparent limitations on what can be imagined\nduring engagements with the arts and, relatedly, what can be made\nfictional in artworks. The paradox of emotional response to\nfictions (widely known as \u201cparadox of fiction\u201d)\nexamines psychological and normative similarities between affective\nresponses prompted by imaginings versus affective responses by\nreality-directed attitudes. The paradox of tragedy and the\nparadox of horror examine psychological and normative\ndifferences between affective responses prompted by imaginings versus\naffective responses by reality-directed attitudes. Finally, the\npuzzle of moral persuasion is concerned with real-world\noutputs of imaginative engagements with artworks; specifically,\nwhether and how artworks can morally educate or corrupt. For more\ndetail on each of these artistic phenomena, see the\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts.\n \n",
