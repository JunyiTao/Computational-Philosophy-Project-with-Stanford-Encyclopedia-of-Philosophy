    "main_text": "Ancient Empiricism || Aristotle\u2019s Empiricism\n3.2 Aristotle\u2019s Empiricism\n\nAristotle discussed a variety of ways in which human beings can\nachieve a grasp of reality. In particular, he mentions five ways in\nwhich \u201cthe soul possesses the truth by way of affirmation or\ndenial\u201d (EN 1139b15\u201317): art or craft\n(techn\u0113), scientific knowledge\n(epist\u0113m\u0113), practical wisdom\n(phron\u0113sis), philosophical wisdom (sophia), and\ncomprehension (nous). These are, however, varieties of\nknowledge; this remark does not tell us about the origins of what we\nknow. So was Aristotle an empiricist? Answering this question is not a\nstraightforward task. While Aristotle does offer us a description of\n\u201csystematic theoretical knowledge\u201d (Pasnau 2013:\n992)\u2014namely, the Posterior Analytics\u2014he offers us\nno analysis of knowledge in general (Taylor 1990: 117).\n\nWe do know, however, that Aristotle believed the senses to be\nreliable, and that we must rely on their deliverances for our\nknowledge of factual matters. Although he insisted that \u201cnot\neverything that appears is true (ou pan to phainomenon\nal\u0113thes)\u201d (Met. 1010b2\u20133), he regarded\nthings as they appear (ta phainomena) as the starting point\nof any inquiry and conformity with them the indication of its success.\nAlthough he uses the phrase ta phainomena broadly\u2014it\nembraces endoxa, \u201creputable opinions\u201d as well as\nwhat is immediately evident to the senses (Owen 1986:\n240)\u2014Aristotle regarded sensation (aith\u0113sis) as\nparticularly trustworthy. Each of the senses has its own proper\nobjects (such as color, in the case of sight) and our grasp of these\nis \u201cis true or [at least] admits the lowest degree of\nfalsehood\u201d (DA 428b18\u201319; cf. 418a11). Not only\nis sensation, at this lowest level, trustworthy, but it is our only\nsource of knowledge when it comes to contingent matters of fact. As\nAristotle writes, \u201cno one can learn anything at all in the\nabsence of sense\u201d and that even when we are not actively\nperceiving, our thinking remains dependent on sensory images\n(DA 432a7\u20139). Insofar as Aristotle\u2019s view of\nknowledge insists on both the reliability of the senses and their\nessential role in the gaining of knowledge, it can be thought of as\nbroadly empiricist.\n\nTo gain a better understand of the nature and limits of\nAristotle\u2019s empiricism, we must once again make some\ndistinctions. Aristotle can be classed as a genetic\nempiricist, for he rejects the claim that we have innate ideas or\nprinciples of reasoning. He is also, arguably, an explanatory\nempiricist, although in a different sense from that found among\nHellenistic medical writers and Sceptics\n (sect. 3.3).\n We can regard him as a modest kind of justificatory\nempiricist, who believes that scientific theorizing is answerable to\nwhat can be observed. But what is contested is whether he can be said\nto be a cognitive empiricist, given the role of intellectual\ninsight in his account of scientific explanation.\n\nWith regard to genetic empiricism, Aristotle rejects the doctrine of\ninnate ideas found in the work of Plato (427\u2013347 BCE). He\nstrongly denies, for instance, that we have innate knowledge of the\nprinciples of scientific demonstration (APo. 100a;\nMet. 993a). This aspect of Aristotle\u2019s empiricism can\nbe illustrated by his attitude to mathematics. For Plato, mathematical\nobjects resemble the Forms\u2014some may in fact be Forms (Shapiro\n2000: 54\u201355)\u2014which occupy a timeless realm distinct from\nthat of the objects of sensation (Rep. 510c1\u2013511b2).\nThey are known, therefore, either by recollection\n(anamn\u0113sis) or by a kind of direct intellectual\nintuition. Along with his rejection of innate ideas, Aristotle also\nrejects this conception of mathematical objects. What the\nmathematician grasps are real features of perceptible objects, but\nregarded in a particular way (Lear 1982: 168, 184). They are regarded\nmerely \u201cas\u201d (h\u0113i) having quantity and being\ncontinuous or as objects of enumeration (Phys.\n193b22\u2013194a10; Met. 1061a28\u20131061b3,\n1077b19\u20131078a4, 1078a22\u201328).\n\nIs Aristotle an explanatory empiricist? Aristotle does accept the need\nfor inferences from what can be observed to facts that are not\nimmediately evident (Asmis 1984: 212\u201317). As he writes,\n\u201cto gain light on things imperceptible we must use the evidence\nof perceptible things\u201d (EN 1104a13\u201314). It\nfollows that something perceived can serve as a sign of something that\nwe would not otherwise know. Roughness of the tongue, for example, is\na sign (s\u0113meion) of fever (DS 462b26\u201332);\nthe large size of hailstones is a sign (s\u0113meion) they\nhave been formed close to the earth (Meteor.\n348a33\u201336). But while knowledge of signs constitutes evidence,\nit does not, in itself, represent scientific knowledge. Scientific\nknowledge is knowledge not just of facts, but of their causes. Even if\nthe association between sign and signified is without exception, so\nthat one can infer the latter from the former, such an inference is\nnot the same as offering an explanation. It may be, for instance, that\nfever is a reliable sign of illness (Rhet. 1357b18\u201319):\nall those with fever have an underlying medical condition. But this\ndoes not yet constitute an explanation, for it does not yet show that\nthe fever is a necessary consequence of the illness. A sign, in other\nwords, can establish only what Aristotle calls \u201cthe fact\u201d\n(to hoti); showing a correlation between sign and signified\ndoes not, in itself, establish the \u201creasoned fact\u201d (to\ndioti) (Madden 1952: 372; cf. APo. 78a23).\n\nSo when it comes to establishing the \u201creasoned\nfact\u201d\u2014the process of scientific explanation\u2014is\nAristotle an explanatory empiricist? Would he deny the legitimacy of\ninferences from observed facts to unobserved (or, perhaps,\nunobservable) causes? Aristotle is cautious regarding our ability to\nknow about matters that cannot be directly observed. As he writes,\nwhen it comes to \u201cmatters inaccessible to the senses,\u201d it\nis sufficient if our investigation arrives at a possible cause\n(Meteor. 344a5\u20137). Insofar as he allows inferences of\nthis kind, Aristotle is not an explanatory empiricist. But the phrase\n\u201cexplanatory empiricism\u201d does not quite fit the shape of\nAristotle\u2019s natural philosophy. Firstly, explanatory empiricism\nstands in an epistemological tradition whose central question is\n\u201cWhat are we justified in believing?\u201d That tradition has\nits origins in later, Hellenistic philosophy\n (sect. 3.3);\n its concerns are not Aristotle\u2019s (Burnyeat 1981: 136). Second,\nwhat Aristotelian explanations appeal to are the \u201ccauses and\nprinciples (aitia kai archai)\u201d\u2014terms Aristotle\nuses interchangeably (Witt 1989: 18)\u2014by which phenomena are made\nintelligible. Some of these \u201cgenerative factors\u201d\n(Moravcsik 1975: 622) are inherent in (enuparchousai) the\nthings to be explained, while others are outside (ektos)\n(Met. 1013a19\u201320; APo. 93a6\u20137). Only the\ngenerative factors that lie outside the fact to be explained (in the\nsense of being distinct from it) could be thought of as unobservable\nentities. The generative factors that are inherent in things are not\nunobservable in the same sense as atoms (for instance) would be. They\nmay still be \u201cnot evident\u201d but in a different sense: it is\nnot always evident that a class of entities share a common nature.\nEstablishing this fact requires \u201cinduction\u201d\n(epag\u014dg\u0113), to which I shall return in a moment.\n\nWhat about justificatory empiricism? It seems that no ancient or\nmedieval thinker would have endorsed a strong form of justificatory\nempiricism, which holds that the origins of a theory are irrelevant to\nits epistemic status. But many did insist that all scientific\ntheorizing was answerable to experience. Aristotle certainly did so.\nAs he remarks, \u201cwe should accept what is evident to the senses\nrather than [mere] reasoning,\u201d and reasoning only if it agrees\nwith the observed facts (GA 760b29\u201333). He had little\nsympathy with the idea that the natural world could be explained in an\nentirely a priori fashion, as Plato sometimes suggests (e.g.\nRep. 530b7\u20138, 531c1\u20135). He criticizes, for\ninstance, the Pythagoreans for forcing their observations of the\nheavens to accord with theory, rather than seeking theories that\naccount for what can be seen to occur (DC 293a25\u201327).\nAristotle is particularly dismissive of the Eleatic philosophers, who\nin their reasoning \u201ctranscended sense perception and disregarded\nit on the grounds of following the argument.\u201d He notes that\nwhile their opinions are supported by reason, it would be\n\u201calmost madness to believe them, when one considers the\nfacts\u201d (GC 325a18\u201320). The facts in question are\nthose revealed by the senses.\n\nIf there is a feature of Aristotle\u2019s thought that may appear to\ncast doubt on his empiricism, it is the account of scientific\nexplanation found in his Posterior Analytics. (I am assuming\nthis is an account of scientific explanation, rather than an account\nof how we form everyday concepts [Scott 1995: 109\u201316].)\nAristotle\u2019s conception of scientific explanation is deductive:\nit involves a derivation of the fact to be explained from first\nprinciples, the latter being \u201ctrue, primary, immediate, better\nknown than and prior to the conclusion, the latter being related to\nthem as effect to cause\u201d (APo. 71b20\u201324). There\nhas been much debate regarding the role of such demonstrations. A\nwidely-held view is that they are not, for Aristotle, a means of\nmaking scientific discoveries. Rather, they are the way in which such\ndiscoveries should be presented (Barnes 1994, xii). Indeed Aristotle\nexpressly denies we can discover explanatory principles by way of\ndemonstration, holding that such demonstrations serve merely to make\nthem clear (APo. 93b16\u201318). This view seems consistent\nwith Aristotle\u2019s practice in his own scientific writings, as\nwell as the methodological remarks found in his biological works. He\nargues, for instance, that when studying animals \u201cwe ought first\nto take the phenomena that are observed in each group, and then go on\nto state their causes\u201d (PA 640a15). While we should not\nconfuse Aristotle\u2019s empiricism with that of Francis Bacon\n(Harari 2004: 35), even his theorizing can be said to begin with what\nis observed.\n\nIt remains true, however, that Aristotle\u2019s ideal presentation of\na scientific explanation is that of a demonstration from first\nprinciples. Only such a demonstration, he believes, would make clear\nthe necessary connection that constitutes a causal relation. While\nthis ideal is not always attainable (Pasnau 2013: 993), it remains a\ndesideratum. So how does one arrive at those principles? It\nis at this point that one might question whether Aristotle truly is an\nempiricist. The principles to which scientific demonstrations appeal\nare universals: they are properties common to all beings of a\nparticular kind which constitute them as beings of that kind.\nAristotle rejects the Platonic idea that such universal properties\nexist extra rem, independently of the individuals that embody\nthem. So in order to arrive at the principles of scientific\nexplanation we need to recognize the identity of kind among the forms\nof particular objects and thus the universal that is embodied in each\nof them (Owens 1966: 168). The process by which we come to grasp the\nuniversals required for scientific explanations is known as\nepag\u014dg\u0113 (APo. 99b15\u2013100b15), a term\ncommonly translated as \u201cinduction.\u201d\n\nWhat Aristotle means by induction (epag\u014dg\u0113) is\nnotoriously unclear (Ross 1949: 50; Harari 2004: 33\u201334), but\nAristotle customarily distinguishes induction from syllogistic\nreasoning, in the sense of demonstration. As he writes in one place,\n\u201call our beliefs come either through demonstration [dia\nsullogismou] or from induction [ex\nepag\u014dg\u0113s]\u201d (APr. 68b13). The general\ncontrast here is that while \u201cdemonstration proceeds from\nuniversals to particulars,\u201d induction takes one \u201cfrom\nparticulars to universals\u201d (Ross 1949: 47; cf. Top.\n195a13\u201314). It is sensation (sense-perception:\naisth\u0113sis) that gives us knowledge of particulars\n(APo. 81b6\u20137), while knowledge of universals is\nrequired for scientific knowledge (epist\u0113m\u0113). So\nwhat is epag\u014dg\u0113, process by which we move from\nperceived particulars to known universals?\n\nAristotle denies (as we have seen) that the universals that form the\nprinciples of a scientific demonstration are themselves to be reached\nby way of demonstration (APo. 72b19\u201320;\n93b16\u201318). But a demonstration (sullogismos) is a\nstrong form of argument, in which conclusions follow necessarily from\nthe premises (APr. 24b18\u201320). So one might think that\nsome weaker form of reasoning could be involved, such as\n\u201cinduction\u201d in our modern sense: a generalization over a\ncollection of particulars. The latter gives rise to the notorious\n\u201cproblem of induction\u201d\n (sect. 4.2),\n of which Aristotle shows some awareness (Top.\n131b19\u201336): how can any limited range of observations justify a\nuniversal claim? But even leaving this problem aside, there is a\nserious objection to understanding Aristotle\u2019s\nepag\u014dg\u0113 in this way. The most such a generalization\ncould show that all individuals of a certain class have certain\ncharacteristics (APo. 92a37\u201392b2): that all swans are\nwhite, for instance. It could not tell us that this characteristic is\nessential, one of the features that constitutes a swan as a swan. In\nany case, Aristotle also suggests that each of the principles of\nscientific explanation is in some sense self-evident: it\n\u201ccommands belief of itself\u201d (kath\u2019heaut\u0113n\neinai pist\u0113n) (Top. 100b19\u201322). This seems to\nexclude the idea that these principles are reached by a process of\nreasoning.\n\nIf we reject the idea that Aristotelian epag\u014dg\u0113 is\na form of enumerative induction, we might be tempted to think of it as\na kind of \u201cimmediate apprehension of essences or forms\u201d\n(Harari 2004: 34), one that occurs in the very process of perceiving\nparticular individuals of a given kind. (This interpretation often\ngoes along with a conception of nous as a faculty of\nintuition [Kahn 1981: 369], rather than a state of understanding\n[Barnes 1994: 267\u201369].) But if epag\u014dg\u0113\ninvolves a process of intellectual intuition that goes beyond what\nsense-perception delivers, it would undercut the claim that Aristotle\nis a genetic (and, perhaps, justificatory) empiricist. Experience\nwould provide nothing more than the occasion on which the necessary\nintuitive insight is gained.\n\nSo is there a way of understanding epag\u014dg\u0113 that\nallows Aristotle to be thought of as an empiricist? One possible\nsolution begins with Aristotle\u2019s puzzling claim that while\n\u201cit is the particular that we sense (aisthanetai men to\nkath\u2019hekaston), sensation is of the universal (h\u0113\nd\u2019aisth\u0113sis tou katholou estin)\u201d (APo.\n100a17\u2013b1). Why is this puzzling? It is puzzling since Aristotle\nelsewhere states that sensation gives us knowledge of particulars, not\nuniversals (APo. 81b6\u20137). So in what sense can\nsensation also be \u201cof the universal\u201d? Various solutions to\nthis question have been offered (Hasker & Yurdin 2014:\n127\u2013130). One solution starts from a remark found at the\nbeginning of the Physics, where Aristotle writes that the\nthings that are immediately apparent to us (and thus the starting\npoint of inquiry) are \u201crather confused\u201d (mallon\nsunkechumena) (Phys. 184a22). Those rather confused\nthings are apparently general facts, for he goes on to remark that\n\u201cit is the whole that is better known to sensation\u201d (Phys.\n184a24\u201325). This suggests that \u201cwe begin by responding\nperceptually to undifferentiated \u2018wholes\u2019\u201d\n(Gasser-Wingate 2021: 149). Only later, by way of analysis\n(Phys. 184a22\u201323), do we come \u201cto recognize the\nspecific nature of that whose generic nature alone is at first\nrecognized\u201d (Ross 1936: 458). On this view, experience\n(empeiria) already gives us a knowledge of universals, but\none that is not yet precise. The \u201cmerely experienced\u201d\nperson is responding reliably to the features that unite entities of a\nkind, but has not yet understood what those features are.\n\nDoes this interpretation solve the problems created by an empiricist\nunderstanding of Aristotle\u2019s idea of science? One objection is\nthat on an Aristotelian view the principles of scientific\nunderstanding must be not merely properties that objects happen to\nhave; they must be properties that objects of this kind necessarily\npossess (Kahn 1981: 389). Can we explain our ability to grasp such\nnecessary properties without invoking some purely intellectual power\nof intuition? Some commentators deny that we can. (See, for instance,\nGaukroger 1978: 124.) One interesting suggestion is that our grasp of\nnecessary properties could arise from our interaction with things,\nthrough our experience of the constraints that the world imposes on\nthat interaction (De Groot 2014: 69). But it is unclear if even this\nkind of experience can yield the strong sense of necessity that an\nAristotelian conception of science demands.\n",
