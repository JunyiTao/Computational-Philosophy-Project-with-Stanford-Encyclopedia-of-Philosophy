    "main_text": "Interpretation and Understanding\n10. Interpretation and Understanding\n\nFrom his \u2018debut\u2019 work, Socratic Memorabilia,\nHamann began to promulgate a particular view of what it means to\nunderstand something. From the beginning of that essay he emphasized\nthe importance of passion and commitment in interpretation;\nundermining the more conventional assumption that objectivity and\ndetachment are prerequisites of philosophical reflection and\nunderstanding. In Aesthetica in Nuce, wearing the authorial\nmask of the \u2018kabbalistic philologian\u2019, he provocatively\nmaintained that initiation into orgies were necessary before the\ninterpreter could safely begin the hermeneutical act. The idea that\none must rid oneself of presuppositions, prejudices, and predilections\nin order to do justice to the subject matter he characterizes as\n\u2018monastic rules\u2019\u2014i.e. an excessive asceticism and\nabstinence. He goes so far as to compare such individuals to\nself-castrating eunuchs (N II, 207:10\u201320).\n\nHamann\u2019s skepticism about neutrality and objectivity does not\nmake him a \u2018subjectivist\u2019, however. The stance and\ndisposition of the interpreter is integral, helpful, indeed,\nindispensable and must be acknowledged; but limitless subjectivity\narouses Hamann\u2019s scorn. Those who \u2018flood the text\u2019\nwith glosses and marginalia, \u201cdreaming up one\u2019s own\ninspiration and interpretation,\u201d Hamann likens to the blind\nleading the blind (N II, 208:3ff).\n\nThe constraints which Hamann places on the interpreter\u2019s\nsubjectivity are not those usually advocated, therefore: an avoidance\nof prejudice and pre-conceptions; an amnesia for one\u2019s own\nhistory, tradition and culture; an obedience to exegetical rules. The\nfirst restraint on subjective distortion is the interpreter\u2019s\nown common sense; the last is the reaction of the text itself:\n\u201cwhat are you trying to make of me?\u201d The\ninterpreter\u2019s freedom is inextricable from the\ninterpreter\u2019s respect and responsibility, in Hamann\u2019s\nview.\n\nThe responsible interpreter is conscious of standing within something\nlarger than oneself: a tradition. The wise interpreter is a kabbalist,\none who interprets an ancient text, and a rhapsodist\u2014the\noriginal meaning of the latter being one who stitches something\ntogether from pre-existing materials. (In Ancient Greece the\n\u2018rhapsodist\u2019 was one who recited poems cobbled together\nfrom prior sources, usually bits of Homer.) In creating\ninterpretations, the interpreter enjoys the freedom to create anew, as\nHamann created his characteristic prose from pre-existing texts, while\ncreating a new meaningful piece. Hamann\u2019s use of this genre\nitself makes the point: the demand that only one meaning may exist for\na text arises from an impoverished notion of meaning and creativity;\none that misunderstands the nature of composition and the nature of\ninterpretation alike.\n\nHamann\u2019s rejected both exegetical \u2018materialism\u2019 and\n\u2018idealism\u2019, as he called them \u2014 literalism and\nexcessive flights of fancy. In thus insisting on the integrity of\n\u2018the letter and the spirit\u2019, he means to preserve\nthe place of author, text and reader alike. Both meaning and\ninterpretation rest in a three-way relationship.\n\nFor Hamann, the depth and meaning of a text go beyond the\nauthor\u2019s own contribution, and are the responsibility of the\ninterpreter: \u201cFew authors understand themselves, and a proper\nreader must not only understand his author but also be able\nto see beyond him\u201d (ZH 6, 22:10\u201312). And yet this\nrecognition that the author\u2019s opinions and intentions do not\nexhaust the possibilities of the text does not annihilate the place of\nthe author. At the very least, the \u2018beyond\u2019 of the text\nincludes a territory which, if unknown to the author, is not\nunrelated: that is, the author\u2019s own unconscious workings and\nmeanings. It is not accidental that Hamann observes not that\nfew authors understand their own text, but that few authors\nunderstand themselves. This suggests a picture of creation in\nwhich more of the author is expressed in a text and entrusted to the\ninterpreter than the author\u2019s conscious intentions and opinions.\nThis in turn suggests a picture of interpretation\u2014of\n\u201cunderstanding one\u2019s hero\u201d as Hamann put it when\nwriting about Socrates\u2014in which greater sensitivity, insight,\nand fidelity is demanded of the interpreter than would otherwise be\nthe case. Above all, the interpreter must have the courage to be a\nkabbalist; that is, to say more than the text does, not to express\noneself but to say what the author left unsaid. The fruits of such\nfaithful creativity may be impossible to \u2018justify\u2019 or\n\u2018verify\u2019 to the demands of the objectivist, however.\n\nFundamentally, for Hamann hermeneutics consists in perceiving the\nunderlying relationship beneath the phenomenon in question; at the\nleast, of course, the relationship between the author and the\ninterpreter which requires such fidelity. Given Hamann\u2019s\nreligious views, this at once introduces a theological dimension.\nUltimately, this means that for Hamann proper hermeneutics rests on\none thing: perceiving God revealed within the phenomenon, whether that\nbe nature or history (cf. Socratic Memorabilia and\nAesthetica in Nuce for examples). Even the interpretation of\nourselves is a revelation of God; a recognition of whose image solves\nall the most complicated knots and riddles of our nature (N II,\n206:32\u2013207:2; 198:3\u20135).\n",
