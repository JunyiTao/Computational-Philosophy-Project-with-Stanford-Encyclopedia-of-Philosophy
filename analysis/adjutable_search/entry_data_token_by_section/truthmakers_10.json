    "main_text": "Which range of truths are eligible to be made true (if any are)? || Humean Scepticism\n2.4 Humean Scepticism\n\nLewis has anyway argued that the doctrine that truth supervenes upon\nbeing\u2014and, by implication, optimalism\u2014are an uncomfortable\nhalfway house. He began by trying to persuade us that the retreat from\nmaximalism was already mandated. He pointed out how deeply\ncounterintuitive it is to suppose that negative existentials are true\nbecause their truth-makers exist. It seems, offhand, that they are\ntrue not because some things do exist but because some don\u2019t.\n\u201cWhy defy this first impression?\u201d (1992: 204). But, more\nimportantly, Lewis pointed out that maximalism was incompatible with\nwhat he took to be the master principle governing our thought about\nmodality: Hume\u2019s denial of necessary connection between distinct\nexistences. It is a consequence of this principle that anything can\nco-exist with anything else that\u2019s distinct. But it is the\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre of any truth-maker for the negative\nexistential truth that there are no unicorns\u2014if there is one and\nwhatever else it is like\u2014that even though it is distinct from\nall unicorns it cannot co-exist with any of them, else it would make\nit true that there are no unicorns even in circumstances where\nunicorns existed. Similarly it is the raison\nd\u2019\u00eatre of any truth-maker for a general truth that\nsuch-and-such are all the facts there are that it refuses to co-exist\nwith any other facts even though it is distinct from them. So if\nwe\u2019re to hang onto Hume\u2019s denial of necessary connexions,\nwe\u2019d better give up the demand for truth-makers for negative and\ngeneral truths, i.e., maximalism (Lewis 1992: 205, 2001:\n610\u201311).\n\nLewis also argues that we can\u2019t stop here\u2014just giving up\nmaximalism for optimalism\u2014because even the truth-makers for\natomic statements conflict with Humeanism. Suppose that the statement\nthat Dog Harry is golden is atomic. Also suppose that Harry is only\naccidentally golden, so the statement is contingent. What is its\ntruth-maker? It can\u2019t be Harry because it\u2019s possible for\nhim to exist even in circumstances where the statement is false, i.e.,\nwhen he has a different coloured coat. But it can\u2019t be the\nproperty of being golden either since there are possible\ncircumstances in which plenty of things are golden but not Harry. It\ncan\u2019t even be the mereological fusion Harry + being\ngolden because it\u2019s a feature of fusions that they exist\neven in circumstances where their parts are otherwise\nunrelated\u2014e.g., when Harry is black whilst Harriet is golden.\nFor this reason, many maximalists make common cause with optimalists\nto posit another fundamental kind of thing to perform the truth-making\nrole in the case of contingent (atomic) predications: facts that\nconsist in objects, properties and relations bound together; in this\ncase the fact Harry\u2019s being golden (Armstrong 1989a:\n41\u20132, 1997: 115\u20136; Mellor 1995: 24). Now facts in general\nand Harry\u2019s being golden in particular cannot be built\nup mereologically from Harry and being golden; otherwise\nHarry\u2019s being golden would be no more fit a candidate\nfor making the statement that Harry is golden true than the fusion\nHarry + being golden. Since Harry\u2019s being\ngolden isn\u2019t built up mereologically from Harry and\nbeing golden, they cannot be parts of it. But if they\naren\u2019t parts of it they must be entirely distinct from this\nstate of affairs. This is where Lewis pounced. Even though\nHarry\u2019s being golden is entirely distinct from its\n\u201cconstituents\u201d it cannot obtain without Harry and\nbeing golden existing. More generally, the obtaining of a\nfact necessitates the existence of its constituents even though the\nfact and its constituents are entirely distinct. So we cannot posit\nfacts as truth-makers for contingent (atomic) statements without going\nagainst Humeanism (Lewis 1992: 200, 1998: 215\u20136, 2001: 611).\n\nOther maximalists and optimalists, often those wary of facts, posit\n(non-transferrable) tropes as truth-makers for contingent predications\n(Martin 1980; Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 295\u2013304, Lowe\n2006: 186\u20137, 204\u20135) Tropes, in the non-transferrable\nsense, are particular instances of properties that are existentially\ndependent upon their bearers. For example, the particular golden\ncolour g of Harry\u2019s coat is a non-transferrable trope\nbecause g could not have existed except as the colour of\nhis coat. Since g is non-transferrable, this trope\nonly exists in circumstances where Harry\u2019s coat is golden; hence\ng\u2019s eligibility to be a truth-maker for the statement\nthat Harry is golden. (If g was transferrable, then\ng could have existed in circumstances where whilst borne by\nHarriet, Harry bore another black trope d; so if g\nis transferrable it isn\u2019t eligible to be a truth-maker for the\nstatement that Harry is golden.) But Lewis\u2019 reasoning can be\neasily extended to show that non-transferrable tropes cannot serve as\nthe truth-makers for contingent statements without contradicting\nHumeanism. If trope g is a property that Harry bears rather\nthan a part of him, then g is wholly distinct from Harry.\nNevertheless, the existence of g necessitates the existence\nof Harry even though they are distinct (MacBride 2005: 121).\nAlternatively if g is a part of the bundle of tropes that\nconstitute Harry, if g is non-transferrable, then the\nexistence of g necessitates the existence of some other\ndistinct tropes that are also parts of this bundle. So Humeanism is\nviolated either way.\n2.4.1 Subject Matter\n\nIn order to avoid contradicting Humeanism, Lewis recommended a further\nweakening of (Truth Supervenes upon Being). According to\nLewis, the kernel of truth in truth-making is the idea that\npropositions have a subject matter. They are about\nthings so whether they are true or false depends on how those things\nstand. This led Lewis to endorse (2003: 25):\n\n(Subject matter) \nAny proposition has a subject matter, on which its truth value\nsupervenes.\n\n\nEquivalently, there cannot be a difference in the truth-value of a\nproposition without a difference in its subject matter. This\nmight consist in (1) an increase or decrease in the population of\nthings that fall within the subject matter; or (2) a shift in the\npattern of fundamental properties and relations those things exhibit\n(Lewis 2001: 612). Now the truth value of \u201cHarry is\ngolden\u201d supervenes upon its subject matter without there needing\nto be any existing thing distinct from Harry or being golden\nthat necessitates their existence; it is enough that the statement\nwould have been false if Harry had lost his hair or been dyed. So we\ncan avoid contradicting Humeanism by abandoning optimalism in favour\nof (Subject matter).\n\nIn an intriguing twist to the plot, Lewis subsequently appeared to\nwithdraw his doubts about truth-makers (2003: 30, Lewis & Rosen\n2003: 39). When building the case for (Subject Matter) Lewis\nhad deliberately remained neutral about the metaphysics of modality\n(2001: 605). But Lewis recognised that if he gave up his neutrality\nand availed himself of counterpart theory then he could supply\ntruth-makers aplenty whilst still adhering to his Humeanism.\n\nAccording to Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory, \u201ca is\nessentially F just in case all of a\u2019s\ncounterparts (including a itself) are F\u201d\n(2003: 27). Counterparts of x are objects that are similar to\nx in certain salient respects. Different conversational\ncontexts make different respects salient. This means that the truth\n(or falsity) of essentialist judgements is always relative to the\ncounterpart relation conversational cues select; so it will often be\nthe case that whilst something is essentially F with respect\nto one counterpart relation it won\u2019t be with respect to another\n(Lewis 1968). In a conversation that makes it salient to think about\nHarry under the counterpart relation of being a golden\nLabrador then every relevant counterpart of him will be golden.\nSo relative to this counterpart relation he is essentially golden. But\nin a different conversation that selects the counterpart relation of\nbeing a dog because then whilst all of his counterparts will\nbe dogs Harry won\u2019t be essentially golden because some of his\ncounterparts will be other colours. What\u2019s important is that\nit\u2019s one and the same thing, our beloved Harry, that\u2019s\nessentially golden with respect to the former counterpart relation but\nonly accidentally so with respect to the latter. To make these\nessentialist judgements count as true in the right contexts we\ndon\u2019t need one dog that\u2019s essentially golden, and another\nthat\u2019s only accidentally so; we just need to think about Harry\nin two different (but compatible) ways.\n\nAccording to (Necessitarian-T) and other related views, the\nproperty a truth-maker x has of making a given proposition\nP true is an essential feature of it. Why so? Because\nx is supposed to be something the mere existence of which\nsuffices for the truth of P; it couldn\u2019t have existed\nwithout P being true (Armstrong 1997: 115). But Lewis\u2019\nproposal is to treat essentialist attributions about truth-making in\nthe same relativistic spirit that counterpart theory treats every\nother modal attribution (2003: 27\u201332). Think of Harry\nqua golden Labrador, i.e., under the counterpart relation of\nbeing a golden Labrador. All his counterparts selected by this\nrelation are golden. So every world in which Harry or one of the\ncounterparts exists is a world in which \u201cHarry is golden\u201d\nis true. In other words, Harry qua golden is truth-maker for\nthe proposition that Harry is golden. But this doesn\u2019t commit us\nto necessary connexions between distinct existences\u2014to a dog\nthat couldn\u2019t have failed to be golden. In another context it\nwill be just as legitimate to talk about Harry in a different way, as\nHarry qua dog. In that context his counterparts will include\ndogs that aren\u2019t golden. So Harry qua dog will be the\ntruth-maker for the statement that Harry is a dog, but not the\nstatement that he is golden.\n\nIn the same way that ordinary objects like Harry can serve as\ntruth-makers for contingent predications, Lewis & Rosen (2003)\nsuggest that the entire world\u2014\u201cthe totality of everything\nthere actually is\u201d\u2014can serve as the truth-maker for\nnegative existentials. Take the world qua unaccompanied by\nunicorns. In the conversational context just set up, the world has no\ncounterparts that are inhabited by unicorns. So the world qua\nunaccompanied by unicorns is essentially lacking in unicorns and\ntherefore qualifies as a truth-maker for the statement that there are\nno unicorns.\n\nHas Lewis shown how it is possible to garner truth-makers for\ncontingent predications and negative existentials without positing\ntotality facts or tropes that ensnare us in a web of necessary\nconnections? Indeed has he shown how we can get by using only ordinary\nobjects and collections of them to serve as truth-makers? We need to\nbe clear about what Lewis is trying to do in this paper. He\nisn\u2019t reporting upon a damascene conversion, belatedly\nrecognising what he had previously denied, that the truth-making role\nis genuine, but then ingeniously coming up with the idea that\nqua-versions of things perform this role just as effectively\nas states of affairs, only without necessary connections between\ndistinct existences. Rather, Lewis\u2019 aim in this paper is to damn\nthe very idea of truth-makers with faint praise. By showing how\nqua versions of things performed the truth-making role just\nas effectively as facts or tropes Lewis aimed to show how\nexplanatorily bankrupt the truth-making role truly was (MacBride 2005:\n134\u20136, Bricker 2015: 180\u20133).\n\nThere are various criticisms of detail that might be made. MacBride\n(2005: 130\u20132) points out that Lewis failed to provide any\naccount of the truthmakers for relational predications and argues that\nit is very difficult to see how the lacuna can be filled when the\nclass of eligible truthmakers is restricted by Lewis to the class of\nordinary things and only intrinsic counterpart relations can be\nevoked. Lewis considers a relaxation of the latter requirement when it\ncame to negative existentials (qua unaccompanied by unicorns\ndoes not express an intrinsic counterpart relation). But MacBride\nargues removing the latter requirement risks trivialising\nLewis\u2019s account because for any object a such that\np is true, for any true p, a satisfies the\ndescription F: \u201cinhabiting a world where p is\ntrue\u201d, hence a qua F makes it true that p.\nBricker (2015: 179\u201380) argues that Lewis can provide for\nrelational predications by allowing sequences to be truthmakers, i.e.\nnot just ordinary things as Lewis required. But Bricker finds this\nsolution ultimately unattractive because it conflicts with another\ntruthmaking principle he finds plausible: that distinct atomic truths\nhave distinct truthmakers.\n\nOne might also object to Lewis\u2019 controversial modal metaphysical\nassumptions of counterpart theory more generally (Rodriguez-Pereyra\n2006b: 193; Dodd 2007: 385). More broadly, one might question whether\nLewis was right to place so much weight upon Hume\u2019s denial of\nnecessary connections between distinct existences or question whether\nLewis had interpreted it correctly (Daly 2000: 97\u20138; MacBride\n2005: 123\u20137; Hoffman 2006; Cameron 2008b). It\u2019s one thing\nto say that we shouldn\u2019t multiply necessities without necessity\nbut it\u2019s another thing to demand that we purge our world-view of\nthem altogether. What about dispositions, chances, laws etc?\nHume relied upon an empiricist theory of content to underpin his\nrejection of necessary connections. But Lewis certainly didn\u2019t\nadvocate such a view. One is left wondering therefore whether\nHume\u2019s denial of necessary connexions should be abandoned along\nwith the theory of content that inspired it, an antiquated relic. If\nso, then we have yet to be given a reason to retreat from either\noptimalism or (Truth Supervenes Upon Being) to (Subject\nMatter)(MacBride 2005: 126\u20137).\n",
