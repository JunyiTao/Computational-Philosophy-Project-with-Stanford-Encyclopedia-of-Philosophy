At first, the problem is experienced as uneasiness and hesitation.\nReflection is needed to articulate what experience signals as a\nproblem. A complete description of the problem to be solved is\nsimultaneously the articulation of a complete solution, a unified\ncourse of action identifying a series of steps (means) resulting in an\nend, which the judger predicts will be found valuable as a\ncomplete package. A person is walking to a lake but stops upon\nreaching a deep ditch. She entertains possible courses of action,\nwhich are simultaneously preliminary descriptions of problems and\nsolutions. (\u201cI need to jump across\u201d; \u201cI need to\nbuild a bridge\u201d). These incomplete descriptions prompt the\ngathering of new data to articulate them further (\u201cCan I jump\nthat far?\u201d \u201cIs there a log around?\u201d). A complete\ninvestigation yields a joint description of the problem and its\nsolution (\u201cI need to drag this log across here, the narrowest\npart of the ditch, and walk across.\u201d) (HWT 200\u20136).\n\nThe value of the end depends on the costs and benefits of the means,\nand the costs and benefits of the further consequences to which the\nend is judged as a means or cause. In the preceding example, it might\nappear that a certain final end \u2014 getting to the lake \u2014 is\ngoverning deliberation. But this is so only provisionally. A full\ninquiry into the means needed to achieve the end may lead to a\nre-evaluation of the end itself. (\u201cThe only log able to bridge\nthe ditch is narrow at the end; I have bad balance; I would be\nseriously injured if I fell off the log. Getting to the lake\nisn\u2019t so attractive after all \u2026.\u201d). Furthermore,\nreaching the end has anticipated consequences of its own (\u201cThat\nbear on the other side of the ditch looks hungry\u2026.\u201d) that\nmay modify the valuation of the end (\u201cIt\u2019s better if I\nstay on this side.\u201d). It is irrational to take one\u2019s end\nas fixed before investigating the costs of the means and the\nconsequences of achieving the end (TV 214). Thus, the standard model\nof instrumental reasoning, which takes ends as fixed and inquires\nsolely into the means needed to satisfy them, is inadequate. The point\nof inquiring into means, and into ends considered as means or causes\nof further consequences, is not merely to determine how to achieve an\nend, but to appraise the value of the end itself (TV 210\u201319; VEK\n4\u20137).\n",
