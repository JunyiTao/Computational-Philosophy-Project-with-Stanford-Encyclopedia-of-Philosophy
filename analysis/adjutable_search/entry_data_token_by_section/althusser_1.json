Early Work (1946\u201360)\n\nDespite its being anthologized and translated during the mid 1990s,\nthere has until recently been relatively little critical attention\npaid to Althusser\u2019s writings prior to 1961. Certainly, in terms\nof method, style, and inspiration, the Althusser found in these works\ndiffers significantly from the Althusser of For Marx and\nReading Capital. In his writings from the 1940s, for\ninstance, his method and conclusions resemble those of the Marxist\nHumanists of whom he would later be so critical, while texts from the\n1950s deploy without irony the Stalinist shibboleths he would later\nsubject to such castigation. Nonetheless, as these texts announce many\nof Althusser\u2019s perennial themes and because some of the\ncontradictions these works possess are shared with his classic texts\nand are repeated again in his late work, these early essays, books,\nand translations are worthy of examination\n",
