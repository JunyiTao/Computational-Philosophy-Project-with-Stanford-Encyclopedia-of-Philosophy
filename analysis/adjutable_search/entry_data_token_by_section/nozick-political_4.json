    "main_text": "Moral Rights and Side-Constraints || Rights as Side Constraints\n2.3 Rights as Side Constraints\n\nFor Nozick, a paradigmatic natural moral right is the right not to be\nsubjected to (unprovoked) killing. Correlative to this right is the\nmoral side constraint to which all individuals are naturally subject\nnot to engage in the (unprovoked) killing of others. As Nozick\nunderstands this right, it forbids A\u2019s (unprovoked)\nkilling of B even if A can prevent W from\nkilling X, Y, and Z only by killing\nB. Although it may in some sense be less\nbad for B to be killed than for X, Y,\nand Z to be killed, A remains bound not to kill\nB. A may not prevent the wrong that W will\ndo in killing X, Y, and Z by killing\nB. For Nozick, rights express the moral inviolability of\nindividuals; and B would not be morally inviolable\u2014nor\nwould any of us be\u2014were B open to use by A\neven for the purpose of preventing the violation of the rights of\nX, Y, and Z. Not even the minimization of\nthe violation of the right against being killed can justify the\nviolation of that right.\n\nAccording to Nozick, our core reason for abstaining from murder is not\nthat abstention advances the goal of minimizing murders. Indeed, if\nthat were our reason to eschew murder, A should not eschew\nmurdering B if that is the only way that he can prevent\nW from murdering X, Y, and Z.\nRather, Nozick\u2019s deontological claim is that the status that\neach individual has as an end-in-himself morally constrains each other\nagent\u2019s conduct toward those individuals. Both A and\nW are morally precluded from the (unprovoked) killing of\nB, X, Y, and Z (and of each\nother). W triply violates this side constraint when he kills\nX, Y, and Z; but A abides\nby this constraint only if he abstains from killing\nB\u2014even if A\u2019s killing of B\nwould (somehow) prevent W\u2019s killing of X,\nY, and Z.\n\nIt is often thought that there is something paradoxical about\ndeontological propositions like the assertion that everyone is bound\nto abstain from the (unprovoked) killing of\n others.[9]\n This thought rests on two standard consequentialist ideas. The first\nis that the wrongness of a given sort of action\u2014e.g.,\n(unprovoked) killing\u2014must derive from the badness of the\n(typical) consequences of actions of that sort. The second is that the\nbadness of the consequences of multiple actions of a given sort can be\naggregated so that (typically) the total badness of the results of a\nbunch of wrongful actions of that sort will be greater than the\nbadness of the results of one action of that sort. For example, the\ntotal badness associated with W\u2019s (unprovoked) killings\nof X, Y, and Z will (typically) be greater\nthan the badness associated with A\u2019s (unprovoked)\nkilling of B. It follows that it will (typically) be wrong\nfor A to abstain from killing B if that is the only\nway to prevent W\u2019s (unprovoked) killings of X,\nY, and Z. The supposed paradox is that the\nwrongfulness of (unprovoked) killing must rest on the badness of the\n(typical) results of such killings; but recourse to the badness of\nresults in the assessment of actions (typically) leads to the\nendorsement of (unprovoked) killings in precisely those cases in which\nthe advocate of deontic constraints wants to insist upon their\nwrongfulness. However, the construction of this paradox of deontology\nrests firmly upon ideas that, as we have seen, Nozick has rejected on\nhis way to asserting deontic side constraints.\n\nNozick also provides a further and seemingly more conventional\ndiscussion of the bases for moral constraints in which various lofty\ncapacities that human beings (usually) possess or are thought to\npossess are cited. He mentions being\n\n\n[S]entient and self-conscious; rational (capable of using abstract\nconcepts, not tied to responses to immediate stimuli); possessing free\nwill; being a moral agent capable of guiding its behavior by moral\nprinciples and capable of engaging in mutual limitation of conduct;\nhaving a soul. (48)\n\n\nTo these he adds \u201cthe ability to regulate and guide its life in\naccordance with some overall conception it chooses to accept\u201d\n(49). But, does the presence of these non-moral features underwrite\nmoral constraints against preventing individuals from exercising these\ncapacities in their own chosen ways? Nozick seeks to bolster the\nsignificance of these features by contending that a person can give\nmeaning to his life only by exercising these capacities in accordance\nwith some overall plan of his own (50). The suggestion is that it is\nnot meaningfulness at large that is crucial for each individual but,\nrather the meaningfulness for him of the life that arises through his\nexercise of an overall plan for his\n life.[10]\n However, Nozick then asks\n\n\nwhy not replace \u2018happiness\u2019 with\n\u2018meaningfulness\u2019 within utilitarian theory, and maximize\nthe total \u2018meaningfulness\u2019 score of the persons in the\nworld? (50)\n\n\nThis is surprising. For one would expect that, in accord with his\nseparateness of persons argument, Nozick would say that the import of\neach individual having a meaningful life as his end is not a\nutilitarianism of meaningful lives but, rather, side constraints on\ninterference with each individual\u2019s pursuit of a meaningful life\nof his own. As Bader points out, for Nozick,\n\nIt is not the case that living a meaningful life is the goal that is\nto be achieved and that rights are the means that permit us to attain\nthis goal. Rather, it is in virtue of the fact that human beings are\nagents whose lives can have meaning that we need to respect their\nchoices, that we have to let them decide how to live their lives.\n(Bader 79\u201380)\n\n",
