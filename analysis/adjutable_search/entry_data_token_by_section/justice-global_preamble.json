    "main_text": "\n\nOn common accounts, we have a state of justice when everyone has their\ndue. The study of justice has been concerned with what we owe one\nanother, what obligations we might have to treat each other fairly in\na range of domains, including over distributive and recognitional\nmatters. Contemporary political philosophers had focused their\ntheorizing about justice almost exclusively within the state, but the\nlast twenty-five years or so has seen a marked extension to the global\nsphere, with a huge expansion in the array of topics covered. While\nsome, such as matters of just conduct in war, have long been of\nconcern, others are more recent and arise especially in the context of\ncontemporary phenomena like intensified globalization, economic\nintegration, and potentially catastrophic pandemics and anthropogenic\nclimate change.\n\nJohn Rawls\u2019s seminal book The Law of Peoples initiated\nmany debates about global justice (Rawls 1999). Several questions soon\nbecame prominent in discussions including: What principles should\nguide international action? What responsibilities do we have to the\nglobal poor? Should global inequality be morally troubling? Are there\ntypes of non-liberal people who should be tolerated? What kind of\nforeign policy is consistent with liberal values? Is a\n\u201crealistic utopia\u201d possible in the global domain? How\nmight we transition effectively towards a less unjust world?\n\nContemporary events also played an enormous role in prompting\nphilosophical inquiries. Prominent cases of genocide, ethnic\ncleansing, forms of terrorism uncommon prior to 2001, intensified\ninterest in immigration to affluent countries, increased dependence on\nthe labor of those from low-income countries, and enormous threats to\nwell-being, security and the environment became common catalysts for\nfurther work. Philosophers began to reflect on questions such as: Is\nit ever permissible to engage in coercive military action for\nhumanitarian purposes, such as to halt genocide or prevent large-scale\nviolations of human rights? Can terrorism ever be justified? Should\naffluent countries open their borders more generously than they\ncurrently do to those from low-income countries who would like to\nimmigrate to them? Are our current global economic arrangements fair\nones and if not, how should they be transformed? What responsibilities\ndo we have to one another in a globalized, post-Westphalian world\norder? How should we allocate responsibilities for reducing global\ninjustice in our world, such as in the case of distributing costs\nassociated with addressing climate change?\n\nIncreased interest concerning issues of global justice also coincided\nwith enhanced interest in the place and value of nationalism. These\nexplorations tracked events such as nationalist clashes which spilled\nover into widespread suffering (notably in the former Yugoslavia and\nRwanda), increased calls for national self-determination to carry\nconsiderable weight, such as in state recognition for Palestinians or\nTibetans, and also in the case of secession (prominently, Quebec). In\nthis area global justice theorists have been concerned with a range of\nimportant questions such as: Under what conditions should claims to\nnational self-determination be granted substantial weight? When should\nself-determination yield to concern for protecting human rights? Are\ncommitments to nationalism and global justice compatible? Is genuine\ndemocracy only possible at the state level or are there robust forms\nof democracy that are possible in more international fora? How are\nideals of democracy best incorporated into defensible global\ninstitutional arrangements? Is world justice possible without a world\nstate? In recent years reflection on existential threats like climate\nchange, war, and pandemics and how perspectives of the oppressed might\ninform the future of the sub-discipline, have contributed new\ndimensions to answering core questions along with adding central\nquestions within the field.\n\nThe primary purpose of this article is to give an orientation to the\nenormous and rapidly expanding field of global justice. There are\nseveral entries in this encyclopedia that already cover some of the\ncore topics well and these will be cross-referenced. But there are\nstill many important gaps, along with some missing context as to how\nsome topics fit together. This entry aims primarily to address these\nneeds.\n",
