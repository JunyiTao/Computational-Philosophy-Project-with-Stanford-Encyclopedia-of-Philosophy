Perhaps Julie was \nchoosing among vacation options, and b was a week\u2019s vacation\nin Paris, while a was a week\u2019s vacation in Peoria. In any \nevent, Julie evidently took the overall merits of b to \noutweigh those of a, even if b was inferior from a \nfinancial standpoint.\n\n(2)\n\nJimmy opted for d over c, despite his judging\nc to be a healthier choice than d.\n\n\n\nAgain, we find Jimmy\u2019s decision unremarkable. Perhaps c and \nd were competing dessert options: c, let us \nsuppose, was a dish of dry Wheaties, rich in fiber and whole grain, \nwhereas d was a gossamer-light yet oh-so-rich Valrhona \nchocolate mousse. Jimmy obviously (and reasonably!) assessed \nd as the better dessert option all things considered, even \nthough he knew d was less good for his health than \nc would be. Nothing puzzling about that.\n\n(3)\n\nJoseph did f rather than e, even though he was\nconvinced that e was the better thing to do all things\nconsidered.\n\n\n\nHere, by contrast, we have a genuinely puzzling case, one we cannot \nmake sense of in the same way. Why would Joseph do f when he\nassessed e as the superior course of action all things \nconsidered? Joseph\u2019s choice sounds so inexplicable that we might\neven query whether the case has been accurately described. If Joseph \nis really freely choosing f over e, we might think \nit questionable that he does genuinely assess e as better \nall things considered. Perhaps he actually takes f to be \nsuperior (for him, under the circumstances), although he thinks most \npeople would opt for e or would say e was a better \nchoice.\n\n\nOur divergent reactions to these three examples point to something \ndistinctive about the judgment that one course of action is better \nthan another. (Better overall, or better all things \nconsidered, that is\u2014not simply better in some respect.) Such \njudgments appear to enjoy a special connection to the agent\u2019s actions\nwhich other judgments do not possess. We are puzzled by Joseph\u2019s \nchoice precisely because we expect people\u2019s actions\u2014at least \nwhen freely undertaken\u2014to reflect their overall assessment of \nthe merits of the alternative courses of action before them. We \nexpect their actions, in other words, to reflect that special \njudgment. And Joseph\u2019s\u2014at least as reported \nabove\u2014doesn\u2019t. When judgment and action are said to have \ndiverged in this way, we are often sceptical: we question whether the\nagent really held the course of action not taken to be better. And \neven when we accept the description of the case, we find such action \nsomehow puzzling, defective, or dubiously intelligible, in a way that\naction contrary to one\u2019s judgments of financial wisdom (for example) \nis not. We can conclude that the particular judgment contrary to \nwhich Joseph acts\u2014the judgment that one course of action is \nbetter than another\u2014has what we can vaguely term a special \ncharacter, in comparison with other judgments such as that one course\nof action is healthier than another.\n\n\nLet us give a name to the assessment of his options contrary to which\nJoseph acts. Let us call his judgment that e is a better \nthing to do all things considered Joseph\u2019s better judgment. \n(\u201cBetter judgment\u201d does not mean \u201csuperior \njudgment\u201d; it simply means a judgment as to which option is \noverall better.) Joseph, then, appears to have acted, freely and \nintentionally, contrary to his better judgment. And this is precisely\nthe phenomenon the philosophical tradition calls \u201cweakness of \n will.\u201d[1]\n Philosophers have been perplexed by or dubious about such action for \na very long \n time.[2]\n Indeed, Plato\u2019s Socrates famously denied its possibility in the \nProtagoras. \u201cNo one,\u201d he declared, \u201cwho \neither knows or believes that there is another possible course of \naction, better than the one he is following, will ever continue on \nhis present course\u201d (Protagoras 358b\u2013c). And \nphilosophers have been wrestling with the issue ever since. It is not\nsurprising that weakness of will has such a long and distinguished \npedigree as a topic of philosophical discussion: it is both an \nintrinsically interesting phenomenon and a topic rich in implications\nfor our broader theories of action, practical reasoning, rationality,\nevaluative judgment, and the interrelations among these.\n", "toc": [{"#HareImpoWeakWill": "1.

Hare on the Impossibility of Weakness of Will\n\n\nLet us commence our examination of contemporary discussions of this \nissue in appropriately Socratic vein, with an account that gives \nexpression to and builds on many of the intuitions that lead us to be\nsceptical about reports like (3) above. For the moral philosopher \nR. M. Hare\u2014as for Socrates\u2014it is impossible for\na person to do one thing if he genuinely and in the fullest sense \nholds that he ought instead to do something else. (If, that \nis\u2014to echo the earlier quote from Socrates\u2014he \n\u201cbelieves that there is another possible course of action, \nbetter than the one he is following.\u201d) This certainly seems to \nconstitute a denial of the possibility of akratic or weak-willed \naction. In Hare\u2019s case it is a consequence of the general account of \nthe nature of evaluative judgments which he defends (Hare 1952; \nsee also Hare 1963).\n\n\nHare is much impressed by what we vaguely referred to above as the \n\u201cspecial character\u201d of evaluative judgments: judgments, \nthat is, such as that one course of action is better than \nanother, or that one ought to do a certain thing. Such \nevaluative judgments seem to have properties that differentiate them \nfrom merely \u201cdescriptive\u201d judgments such as that one \nthing is more expensive than another, or rounder than another \n(Hare 1952, p. 111). Evaluative judgments seem, in \nparticular, to bear a special connection to action which no \npurely descriptive judgment possesses. Hare\u2019s analysis, then, takes \noff from something like the data we rehearsed earlier. Hare goes on \nto develop these data in the following way. He begins by identifying,\nas the fundamental distinctive feature of evaluative \njudgments\u2014that which lends them a special character\u2014that \nevaluative judgments are intended to guide conduct. (See, \ne.g., Hare 1952, p. 1; p. 29; p. 46; p. 125;\np. 127; p. 142, pp. 171\u20132; Hare 1963, \np. 67; p. 70.) The special function of evaluative judgments\nis to be action-guiding: that is, if you will, what evaluative \njudgments are for. Hare then puts a more precise gloss on \nwhat it is for a judgment to \u201cguide conduct\u201d: an \naction-guiding judgment is one which entails an answer to the \npractical question \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d (Hare 1952, \np. 29; see Hare 1963, p. 54 for the terminology \u201cpractical \n question\u201d).[3]\n What is it that an action-guiding judgment must entail? That is, what\nconstitutes an answer to the question \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d \nHare holds that no (descriptive) statement can constitute an answer \nto such a question (Hare 1952, p. 46). Rather, such a \nquestion is answered by a first-person command or \nimperative (Hare 1952, p. 79), which could be \nverbally expressed as \u201cLet me do a\u201d \n(Hare 1963, p. 55).\n\n\nTo recap the argument thus far: it is the function of evaluative \njudgments like \u201cI ought to do a\u201d to guide \nconduct. Guiding conduct means entailing an answer to the question \n\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d An answer to that question will take \nthe form \u201cLet me do a,\u201d where this is a \nfirst-person command or imperative. Therefore evaluative judgments \nentail such first-person imperatives (Hare 1952, p. 192). \nNow in general, if judgment J1 entails judgment \nJ2, then assenting to J1 must\ninvolve assenting to J2: someone who professed to\nassent to J1 but who disclaimed \nJ2 would be held not to have spoken correctly \nwhen he claimed to assent to J1 (Hare 1952, \np. 172). So assenting to an evaluative judgment like \u201cI \nought to do a\u201d involves assenting to the first-person \ncommand \u201cLet me do a\u201d (Hare 1952, \npp. 168\u20139). We should inquire, then, what exactly is \ninvolved in sincerely assenting to a first-person command or \nimperative of this type. Just as sincere assent to a statement \ninvolves believing that statement, sincere assent to an \nimperative addressed to ourselves involves doing the thing \nin question:\n\n  It is a tautology to say that we cannot sincerely assent to a\n  \u2026 command addressed to ourselves, and at the same\n  time not perform it, if now is the occasion for performing it\n  and it is in our (physical and psychological) power to do so.\n  (Hare 1952, p. 20)\n\n\n\nSo: provided it is within my power to do a now, if I do not \ndo a now it follows that I do not genuinely judge that I \nought to do a now. Thus, as Hare states at the very opening \nof his book, a person\u2019s evaluative judgments are infallibly revealed \nby his actions and choices:\n\n  If we were to ask of a person \u2018What are his moral\n  principles?\u2019 the way in which we could be most sure of a true\n  answer would be by studying what he did\u2026. It would\n  be when \u2026 he was faced with choices or decisions between\n  alternative courses of action, between alternative answers to the\n  question \u2018What shall I do?\u2019, that he would reveal in\n  what principles of conduct he really believed. (Hare 1952,\n  p. 1)\n\n\n\nNote that Hare is not simply saying that a person\u2019s actions are the \nmost reliable source of evidence as to his evaluative judgments, or \nthat if a person did b the most likely hypothesis is that he\njudged b to be the best thing to do. Hare is saying, rather,\nthat it follows from a person\u2019s having done b that \nhe judged b best from among the options open to him at the \ntime. On this view, then, akratic or weak-willed actions as we have \nunderstood them are impossible. There could not be a case in which \nsomeone genuinely and in the fullest sense held that he ought to do \na now (where a was within his power) and yet did \nb. On Hare\u2019s view, \u201cit becomes analytic to say that \neveryone always does what he thinks he ought to [if physically and \npsychologically able]\u201d (Hare 1952, p. 169).\n\n\nBut does everyone always do what he thinks he ought to, when\nhe is physically and psychologically able? It may seem that this is \nsimply not always the case (even if it is usually the case).\nHave you, dear reader, never failed to get up off the couch \nand turn off the TV when you judged it was really time to start \ngrading those papers? Have you never had one or two more \ndrinks than you thought best on balance? Have you never \ndeliberately pursued a sexual liaison which you viewed as an overall \nbad idea? In short, have you never acted in a way which \ndeparted from your overall evaluation of your options? If so, let me \nbe the first to congratulate you on your fortitude. While weak-willed\naction does seem somehow puzzling, or defective in some important \nway, it does nonetheless seem to happen.\n\n\nFor Hare, however, any apparent case of akrasia must in fact\nbe one in which the agent is actually unable to do \na, or one in which the agent does not genuinely evaluate \na as better\u2014even if he says he \n does.[4]\n As an example of the first kind of case Hare cites Medea \n(Hare 1963, pp. 78\u20139), who (he contends) is powerless,\nliterally helpless, in the face of the strong emotions and desires \nroiling her: she is truly unable (psychologically) to resist\nthe temptations besieging her. A typical example of the second kind \nof case, on the other hand, would be one in which the agent is \nactually using the evaluative term \u201cgood\u201d or \n\u201cought\u201d only in what Hare calls an \n\u201cinverted-commas\u201d sense (Hare 1952, p. 120; \npp. 124\u20136; pp. 164\u20135; pp. 167\u2013171). \nIn such cases, when the agent says (while doing b) \u201cI \nknow I really ought to do a,\u201d he means only that most \npeople\u2014or, at any rate, the people whose opinions on such \nmatters are generally regarded as authoritative\u2014would say he \nought to do a. As Hare notes (Hare 1952, p. 124), \nto believe this is not to make an evaluative judgment oneself; \nrather, it is to allude to the value-judgments of other people. Such \nan agent does not himself assess the course of action he fails to \nfollow as better than the one he selects, even if other people \nwould.\n\n\nNo doubt there are cases of the two types Hare describes; but they do\nnot seem to exhaust the field. We can grant that there is the odd \nmurderer, overcome by irresistible homicidal urges but horrified at \nwhat she is doing. But surely not every case that we might be tempted\nto describe as one of acting contrary to one\u2019s better judgment \ninvolves irresistible psychic forces. Consider, for example, the \nfollowing case memorably put by J. L. Austin:\n\n  I am very partial to ice cream, and a bombe is served divided into\n  segments corresponding one to one with the persons at High Table: I\n  am tempted to help myself to two segments and do so, thus succumbing\n  to temptation and even conceivably (but why necessarily?) going\n  against my principles. But do I lose control of myself? Do I raven,\n  do I snatch the morsels from the dish and wolf them down, impervious\n  to the consternation of my colleagues? Not a bit of it. We often\n  succumb to temptation with calm and even with finesse.\n  (Austin 1956/7, p. 198)\n\n\n\n(I might add that it also seems doubtful that irresistible psychic \nforces kept you on the couch watching TV while those papers were \nwaiting.) As for the \u201cinverted-commas\u201d case, this too \nsurely happens: people do sometimes pay lip service to conventional \nstandards which they themselves do not really accept. But again, it \nseems highly doubtful that this is true of all seeming cases of \nweak-willed action. It seems depressingly possible to select and \nimplement one course of action while genuinely believing \nthat it is an overall worse choice than some other option open to \nyou.\n\n\nHas something gone wrong? We started with the \nunexceptionable-sounding thought that moral and evaluative judgments \nare intended to guide conduct; we arrived at a blanket denial of the \npossibility of akratic action which fits ill with observed facts. But\nif we are disinclined to follow Hare this far we should ask what the \nalternative is, for it may be even worse. For Hare, the answer is \nclear: our only other option is to repudiate the idea that moral and \nother evaluative judgments have a special character or nature, namely\nthat of being action-guiding. For we should recall that Hare presents\nall his subsequent conclusions as simply following, through a series \nof steps, from that initial thought. \u201cThe reason why actions \nare in a peculiar way revelatory of moral principles is that the \nfunction of moral principles is to guide conduct,\u201d Hare \ncontinues in the passage quoted earlier (Hare 1952, p. 1). For \nHare, then, the only way to escape his \u201cSocratic\u201d \nconclusion about weakness of will would be to give up the idea that \nevaluative judgments are intended to guide conduct, or to \u201chave\n[a] bearing upon our actions\u201d (Hare 1963, p. 169; see\nalso Hare 1952, p. 46; p. 143; p. 163; \npp. 171\u20132; and Hare 1963, p. 70; p. 99).\n\n\nThe choices before us, then, as presented by Hare, are Hare\u2019s own \nview, or one which assigns no distinctive role in action or practical\nthought to evaluative judgments, treating them as just like any other\njudgment. We might call the first of these an extreme version of \n(judgment) internalism. (I use this polysemous label to \nrefer, here, to the idea that certain judgments have an internal or \nnecessary connection to motivation and to action.) By extension, we \nmight usefully follow Michael Bratman in calling the second type of \nview \u201cextreme externalism\u201d (Bratman 1979, \npp. 158\u20139).\n\n\nExtreme externalism also seems unsatisfactory, however. First, it \nseems unable to explain why there should be anything perplexing or \nproblematical about action contrary to one\u2019s better judgment, why \nthere should be any philosophical problem about its possibility or \nits analysis. On this kind of view, it seems, Joseph\u2019s choice ((3) \nabove) should strike us as no more puzzling than Julie\u2019s or Jimmy\u2019s \n((1) or (2)). As Hare puts it:\n\n  On the view that we are considering, there is nothing odder about\n  thinking something the best thing to do in the circumstances, but\n  not doing it, than there is about thinking a stone the roundest\n  stone in the vicinity and not picking it up, but picking up some\n  other stone instead\u2026. There will be nothing that requires\n  explanation if I choose to do what I think to be, say, the worst\n  possible thing to do and leave undone what I think the best thing to\n  do. (Hare 1963, pp. 68\u20139)\n\n\n\nBut our reactions to (1), (2), and (3) show that we do think\nthere is something peculiar about action contrary to one\u2019s better \njudgment which renders such action hard to understand, or perhaps \neven impossible. An extreme externalist view thus seems to \nmischaracterize the status of akratic actions.\n\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, however, extreme externalism has \ndramatic implications for our understanding of intentional action in \ngeneral\u2014not just weak-willed action. For such a view implies \nthat\n\n  deliberation about what it would be best to do has no closer\n  relation to practical reasoning than, say, deliberation about what\n  it would be chic to do. If one happens to care about what it would\n  be chic to do, then a consideration of this matter may play an\n  important role in one\u2019s practical reasoning. If one does not care,\n  it will be irrelevant. The case is the same with reasoning about\n  what it would be best to do. (Bratman 1979, p. 158)\n\n\n\nTo adopt a general doctrine of this sort seems an awfully precipitous\nresponse to the possibility of akrasia. For it seems \nextremely plausible to assign to our overall evaluations of our \noptions an important role in our choices. Man is a rational animal, \nthe saying goes; that is\u2014to offer one gloss on this \nidea\u2014we act on reasons, and in the light of our assessments of \nthe overall balance of reasons. When we engage in deliberation or \nreasoning about what to do, we often proceed by thinking about the \nreasons which favor our various options, and then bringing these \ntogether into an overall assessment which is, precisely, intended to \nguide our choice.\n\n\nOr, as Bratman puts it, we very often reason about what it is \nbest to do as a way of settling the question of what \nto do. (He calls this \u201cevaluative practical \nreasoning\u201d: Bratman 1979, p. 156.) \u201cOne\u2019s \nevaluations [thus] play a crucial role in the reasoning underlying \nfull-blown action,\u201d Bratman holds (p. 170), and to be \nforced to deny this would be in his view \u201ctoo high a price to \npay\u201d (p. 159). As Alfred Mele similarly puts it, \n\u201cthere is a real danger that in attempting to make causal and \nconceptual space for full-fledged akratic action one might commit \noneself to the rejection of genuine ties between evaluative judgment \nand action\u201d (1991, p. 34). But that would be to throw the \nbaby out with the bathwater. If we want to resist Hare\u2019s conclusions,\nwe must do so in a way which steers clear of the danger to which Mele\nalerts us. We must navigate between the Scylla of extreme internalism\nand the Charybdis of extreme externalism.\n2. Davidson on the Possibility of Weakness of Will\n\n\nThis is just what Donald Davidson set out to do in a rich, elegant, \nand incisive paper published in 1970 which has had a towering \ninfluence on the subsequent literature. Davidson\u2019s treatment aims to \nvindicate the possibility of weakness of will; to offer a novel \nanalysis of its nature; to clarify its status as a marginal, somehow \ndefective instance of agency which we rightly find dubiously \nintelligible; and to do all this within the contours of a general \nview of practical reasoning and intentional action which assigns a \ncentral and special role to our evaluative judgments. Let us see how \nhe proposes to do these things.\n\n\nFirst, Davidson offers the following general characterization of \nweak-willed or incontinent \n action:[5]\n\n\n  In doing b an agent acts incontinently if and only\n  if: (a) the agent does b intentionally;\n  (b) the agent believes there is an alternative action\n  a open to him; and (c) the agent judges that, all things\n  considered, it would be better to do a than to do\n  b.\n\n\n\nWe initially described weak-willed action as free, intentional action\ncontrary to the agent\u2019s better judgment; it may be useful to see how\nDavidson\u2019s more precise definition matches up with that initial\ncharacterization. Davidson\u2019s condition (a) requires that the action in\nquestion be intentional.[6] Condition (b) seems intended to ensure that\nthe action in question is\n\n free.[7]\n Part (c) of Davidson\u2019s definition represents what we have called the \nagent\u2019s \u201cbetter judgment,\u201d that is, the overall \nevaluation of his options contrary to which the incontinent agent \nacts.\n\n\nDavidson notes that \u201cthere is no proving such actions exist; \nbut it seems to me absolutely certain that they do\u201d \n(p. 29). Why, then, is there a persistent tendency, both in \nphilosophy and in ordinary thought, to deny that such actions are \npossible? Davidson\u2019s diagnosis is that two plausible principles which\n\u201cderive their force from a very persuasive view of the nature \nof intentional action and practical reasoning\u201d (p. 31) \nappear to entail that incontinence is impossible. He articulates \nthose two principles as follows (p. 23):\n\nP1. If an agent wants to do a more than he wants to\n  do b and he believes himself free to do either a\n  or b, then he will intentionally do a if he does\n  either a or b intentionally.\n\nP2. If an agent judges that it would be better to do\n  a than to do b, then he wants to do a\n  more than he wants to do b.\n\n\n\nP2, Davidson observes, \u201cconnects judgements of what it is \nbetter to do with motivation or wanting\u201d (p. 23); he adds \nlater that it \u201cstates a mild form of internalism\u201d \n(p. 26). Davidson is proposing, contra the extreme \nexternalist position, that our evaluative judgments about the merits \nof the options we deem open to us are not motivationally inert. While\nhe admits that one could quibble or tinker with the formulation of P1\nand P2 (pp. 23\u20134; p. 27; p. 31), he is confident\nthat they or something like them give expression to a powerfully \nattractive picture of practical reasoning and intentional action, one\nwhich assigns an important motivational role to the agent\u2019s \nevaluative \n judgments.[8]\n\n\n\nThe difficulty is, though, that P1 and P2\u2014however \nattractive\u2014together imply that an agent never intentionally \ndoes b when he judges that it would be better to do \na (if he takes himself to be free to do either). And this \ncertainly looks like a denial of the possibility of incontinent \naction. No wonder, then, that so many have been tempted to say that \nakratic action is impossible! Looking carefully, however, we can see \nthat P1 and P2 do not imply the impossibility of incontinent\nactions as Davidson has defined them. For Davidson \ncharacterizes the agent who incontinently does b as holding,\nnot that it would be better to do a than to do b, \nbut that it would be better, all things considered, to do \na than to do b. Is the \u201call things \nconsidered\u201d just a rhetorical flourish? Or does it mark a \ngenuine difference between these two judgments? If these are two \ndifferent judgments, and one can hold the latter without holding the \nformer, then incontinent action is possible even if P1 and P2 are\ntrue.\n\n\nIn the rest of his paper Davidson sets out to vindicate that very \npossibility. The phrase \u201call things considered\u201d is not, \nas it might seem, merely a minor difference in wording that allows \nweakness of will to get off on a technicality. Rather, that phrase \nmarks an important contrast in logical form to which we would need to\nattend in any case in order properly to understand the structure of \npractical reasoning. For that phrase indicates a judgment that is \nconditional or relational rather than \nall-out or unconditional in form; and that \ndifference is \n crucial.[9]\n We can better see the relational character of an \nall-things-considered judgment if we first look at evaluative \njudgments that play an important role in an earlier phase of \npractical reasoning, the phase where we consider what reasons or \nconsiderations favor doing a and what reasons or \nconsiderations favor doing b. (For simplicity, imagine a \ncase in which an agent is choosing between only two mutually \nincompatible options, a and b.) These  prima\nfacie judgments, as Davidson terms them, take the form:\n\nPF: In light of r, a is prima\n  facie better than b.\n\n\n\nIn this schema r refers to a consideration, say that \na would be relaxing, while b would be stressful. A \nPF judgment of this kind thus identifies one respect in which \na is deemed superior to b, one perspective from \nwhich a comes out on top.\n\n\nWe should pause to note three things about PF judgments. (a) A PF \njudgment is not itself a conclusion in favor of the overall \nsuperiority of a. Such \u201call-out\u201d evaluative \njudgments have a simpler logical form, namely:\n\nAO: a is better than b.\n\n\n\n(b) Indeed, no conclusion of the form AO follows logically from any \nPF judgment. (c) More strongly: the fact, taken by itself, that \nsomeone has made a certain PF judgment does not even supply her with \nsufficient grounds to draw the corresponding AO conclusion. For even \nif she makes one PF judgment which favors a over b,\nas in the case we imagined, she may also make other\nPF judgments which favor b over a (say, when \nr is the consideration that b would be lucrative, \nwhile a would be expensive). We do not want to say in that \ncase that she has sufficient grounds to draw each of two incompatible\nconclusions (that a is better than b, and that \nb is better than a; these are incompatible provided\nthe better-than relation is asymmetric, assumed here).\n\n\nWe have contrasted PF judgments with AO or \u201call-out\u201d \nevaluative judgments. PF judgments are relational in character: they \npoint out a relation which holds between the consideration \nr and doing a. (We could call that relation the \n\u201cfavoring\u201d relation.) That relation is not such as to \npermit us to \u201cdetach\u201d (as Davidson puts it, p. 37) \nan unconditional evaluative conclusion in favor of doing a \nfrom PF and the supposition that r obtains. That is, we are \nnot to understand PF judgments as having the form of a material \nconditional.\n\n\nDavidson\u2019s innovative suggestion is that judgments with this PF \nlogical form are an appropriate way to model what happens in the \nearly stages of practical reasoning, where we rehearse reasons for \nand against the options we are considering. And his stressing that no\nsuch PF judgment commits the agent to an overall evaluative \nconclusion in favor of a or b is useful in thinking\nabout a case like Julie\u2019s ((1) above). We described Julie as knowing \n(and therefore believing) that b was more expensive than \na, but opting for b nonetheless. We can imagine, \nthen, that among the ingredients of Julie\u2019s practical reasoning was a\nPF judgment like this:\n\n  In light of the fact that b is more expensive than a,\n  a is prima facie better than b.\n\n\n\nBut this PF judgment alone, as we have seen, does not commit her to \nthe overall judgment that a is better than b. For \nshe may also have made other PF judgments, such as\n\n  In light of the fact that b would be much more\n  gastronomically exciting than a, b is prima\n    facie better than a.\n\n\n\nBut we would not then want to say Julie has sufficient grounds to \nconclude that a is better than b and to conclude \nthat b is better than a. She does not have \nsufficient grounds to embrace a contradiction; her premises all seem \nconsistent. So her various PF judgments, when considered separately, \nmust not each commit her to a corresponding overall \nconclusion in favor of a or b.\n\n\nPractical reasoning, Davidson suggests, starts from judgments like \nthese, each identifying one respect in which one of the options is \nsuperior. But in order to make progress in our practical reasoning we\nshall eventually need to consider how a compares to \nb not just with respect to one consideration, but \nin the light of several considerations taken together. That is, Julie\nwill eventually need to consider how to fill in the blanks in a PF \njudgment like this:\n\n  In light of the fact that b is more expensive\n  than a and the fact that b would be much\n  more gastronomically exciting than a, \u2026 is prima\n  facie better than \u2026.\n\n\n\nThis PF judgment is more comprehensive than the ones we \nattributed to Julie a moment ago, as it takes into account a broader \nrange of considerations. (I take the label \n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d from Lazar 1999.) Now in Julie\u2019s case we \ncan surmise how she filled in those blanks: with \u201cb is\nprima facie better than a.\u201d Julie\u2019s filling \nin the blanks in that way can naturally be taken as expressing the \nview that the much greater gastronomic excitement promised by \nb outweighs or overrides b\u2019s \ninferiority to a from a strictly financial standpoint.\n\n\nWe can generalize our schema for PF judgments to account for the \npossibility of relativizing our comparative assessment of a \nand b not just to a single consideration, but to multiple \nconsiderations taken together or as a body:\n\nPFN: In light of \u27e8r1, \u2026,\n  rn\u27e9, a is prima facie\n  better than b.\n\n\n\nNotice that PFN judgments are still relational in form: they assert \nthat a relation (the \u201cfavoring\u201d relation) holds between \nthe set of considerations \u27e8r1, \n\u2026, rn\u27e9 and doing a. Indeed, \nthe relational character of a PFN judgment remains even if we make it\nas comprehensive as we can: if we expand the set \n\u27e8r1, \u2026, rn\u27e9\nto incorporate all the considerations the agent deems \nrelevant to her decision. Following Davidson (p. 38), let us \ngive the label e to that set. So even the following \njudgment:\n\nATC: In light of e, a is prima\n  facie better than b.\n\n\n\nis a relational or conditional judgment and not an all-out conclusion\nin favor of doing a. To make a judgment of the form ATC is \nnot to draw an overall conclusion in favor of doing \na.\n\n\nWe may be better able to see this by considering an analogy from \ntheoretical reason. Suppose Hercule Poirot has been called in to \ninvestigate a murder. We can imagine him assessing bits of evidence \nas he encounters them:\n\nIn light of the fact that the murder weapon belongs to Colonel\n  Mustard, Mustard looks guilty;\nIn light of his having an alibi for the time of the murder, Mustard\n  looks not guilty;\n\n\n\nand so on. These are theoretical analogues of the PF judgments \nrelativized to single considerations which we looked at earlier. \nHowever, Poirot will eventually need to consider how these various \nbits of evidence add up; that is, he will eventually need to fill in \nthe blanks in a more comprehensive PFN judgment like this:\n\n  In light of\n  \u27e8e1, \u2026, en\u27e9,\n  \u2026 looks to be the guilty party,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\u27e8e1, \u2026, en\u27e9\nis a set of bits of pertinent evidence. Notice, though, that no such \nPFN judgment actually constitutes settling on a particular person as \nthe culprit. For even if we put in a maximally large \n\u27e8e1, \u2026, en\u27e9\nconsisting of all the evidence Poirot has seen, and imagine \nhim thinking\n\n  All the evidence I have seen points toward Colonel Mustard as the\n  guilty party,\n\n\n\nto make this observation is manifestly not to conclude that \nMustard is guilty.\n\n\nIn the same way, an ATC or all-things-considered judgment, although\ncomprehensive, is still relational in nature, and therefore distinct\nfrom an AO judgment in favor of a. That is, it is possible to\nmake an ATC judgment in favor of a without making the\ncorresponding AO judgment in favor of a. (This is the\nanalogue of Poirot\u2019s position.)  And this is the key to Davidson\u2019s\nsolution to the problem of how weakness of will is possible. For ATC\nis, precisely, the agent\u2019s better judgment as Davidson\nconstrues it in his definition of incontinent action. P1 and P2\ntogether imply that an agent who reaches an AO conclusion in favor\nof a will not intentionally do b. But the\nincontinent agent never reaches such an AO conclusion. With respect\nto a, he remains stuck at the Hercule Poirot stage: he sees\nthat the considerations he has rehearsed, taken as a body,\nfavor a, but he is unwilling or unable to make a commitment\nto a as the thing to do.[10] He makes only a relational ATC judgment\nin favor of a, contrary to which he then acts.\n\n\nWhat should we say about an agent who does this? Returning to the \nthree features of prima facie or PF judgments which we noted\nearlier, features (a) and (b) hold even of the special \nsubclass of PF judgments which are ATC judgments. Such judgments \nneither are equivalent to, nor logically imply, any AO judgment. So \nthe incontinent agent who fails to draw the AO conclusion which \ncorresponds to his ATC conclusion, and to perform the corresponding \naction, is not committing \u201ca simple logical blunder\u201d \n(p. 40). Notably, he does not contradict himself. He does, \nhowever, exhibit a defect in rationality, on Davidson\u2019s account. For \nfeature (c) of PF judgments in general does not hold of the \nspecial subclass of such judgments which are ATC judgments. Drawing \nan ATC conclusion in favor of a does give \none sufficient grounds to conclude that a is better sans\nphrase and, indeed, to do \na. For Davidson proposes that the transition from an ATC \njudgment in favor of a to the corresponding AO judgment, and\nto doing a, is enjoined by a substantive principle of \nrationality which he dubs \u201cthe principle of continence.\u201d \nThat principle tells us to \u201cperform the action judged best on \nthe basis of all available relevant reasons\u201d (p. 41); and \nthe incontinent agent violates this injunction. The principle of \ncontinence thus substantiates the idea that \u201cwhat is wrong is \nthat the incontinent man acts, and judges, irrationally, for this is \nsurely what we must say of a man who goes against his own best \njudgement\u201d (p. 41). He acts irrationally in virtue of \nviolating this substantive principle, obedience to which is a \nnecessary condition for rationality.\n\n\nWe must put this point about the irrationality of incontinence with \nsome care, however. For recall that an incontinent action must itself\nbe intentional, that is, done for a reason. The weak-willed agent, \nthen, has a reason for doing b, and does b for that\nreason. What he lacks\u2014and lacks by his own lights\u2014is a \nsufficient reason to do b, given all the \nconsiderations that he takes to favor a. As Davidson puts \nit, if we ask \u201cwhat is the agent\u2019s reason for doing \n[b] when he believes it would be better, all things \nconsidered, to do another thing, then the answer must be: for this, \nthe agent has no reason\u201d (p. 42). And this is so even \nthough he does have a reason for doing b (p. 42, \nn. 25). Because the agent has, by his own lights, no adequate \nreason for doing b, he cannot make sense of his own action: \n\u201che recognizes, in his own intentional behaviour, something \nessentially surd\u201d (p. 42). So akratic action, while \npossible on Davidson\u2019s account, is nonetheless necessarily \nirrational; this is the sense in which it is a defective and\nnot fully intelligible instance of agency, despite being a very real \nphenomenon.\n3. The Debate After Davidson\n3.1 Internalist and Externalist Strands\n\n\nDavidson has certainly presented an arresting theory of practical \nreasoning. But has he shown how weakness of the will is possible? \nMost philosophers writing after him, while acknowledging his \npathbreaking work on the issue, think he has not. One principal \ndifficulty which subsequent theorists have seized on is that \nDavidson\u2019s view can account for the possibility of action contrary to\none\u2019s better judgment only if one\u2019s better judgment is \nconstrued merely as a conditional or prima facie judgment. \nDavidson\u2019s P1 and P2 in fact rule out the possibility of free \nintentional action contrary to an all-out or unconditional evaluative\n judgment.[11]\n But it seems that such cases exist. Michael Bratman, for instance, \nintroduces us to Sam, who, in a depressed state, is deep into a \nbottle of wine, despite his acknowledged need for an early wake-up \nand a clear head tomorrow (1979, p. 156). Sam\u2019s friend, stopping \nby, says:\n\n  Look here. Your reasons for abstaining seem clearly stronger than\n  your reasons for drinking. So how can you have thought that it would\n  be best to drink?\n\nTo which Sam replies:\n\n  I don\u2019t think it would be best to drink. Do you think\n  I\u2019m stupid enough to think that, given how strong my reasons\n  for abstaining are? I think it would be best to abstain. Still,\n  I\u2019m drinking. \n\n\n\nSam\u2019s case certainly seems possible as described. Davidson\u2019s view, \nthough, must reject it as impossible. Given his conduct, Sam can\u2019t \nthink it best to abstain; at most, he thinks it all-things-considered\nbest to abstain, a very different kettle of fish. But this seems \nfalse of Sam: there is no evidence that he has remained stuck at the \nHercule Poirot stage with respect to the superiority of abstaining. \nHe seems to have gone all the way to a judgment sans phrase \nthat abstaining would be better; and yet he drinks.\n\n\nIronically, this complaint makes Davidson out to be a bit like Hare. \nLike Hare, Davidson subscribes to an internalist principle (P2) which\nconnects evaluative judgments with motivation and hence with action. \n(Indeed, in light of the difficulty raised here, one might wonder if \nDavidson is entitled to consider P2 a \u201cmild\u201d form of \ninternalism (p. 26).) As with Hare, this internalist commitment \nrules out as impossible certain kinds of action contrary to one\u2019s \nevaluative judgment. Now Davidson, like Hare, does accept the \npossibility of certain phenomena in this neighborhood; but\u2014as \nwith Hare\u2014critics think the cases permitted by his analysis \nsimply do not exhaust the range of actual cases of weakness of will. \nThe phenomenon seems to run one step ahead of our attempts to make \nroom for it.\n\n\nThose writing after Davidson have tended to focus, then, on the \nquestion of the possibility and rational status of action contrary to\none\u2019s unconditional better \n judgment.[12]\nNaturally, different theorists have plotted different courses through\nthese shoals. Some tack more to the internalist side, wishing to\npreserve a strong internal connection between evaluation and action\neven at the risk of denying or seeming to deny the possibility of\nakratic action (or at least some understandings of it). Examples of\nsome post-Davidson treatments which share a broadly internalist\nemphasis, even if they feature different flavors of internalism, are\nthose of Bratman (1979), Buss (1997), Tenenbaum (1999; see also 2007,\nch. 7), and Stroud (2003). The main danger for such approaches is that\nin seeking to preserve and defend a certain picture of the primordial\nrole of evaluative thought in rational action\u2014a picture critics\nare likely to dismiss as too rationalistic\u2014such theorists may be\nled to reject common phenomena which ought properly to have\nconstrained their more abstract theories. (See the opening of Wiggins\n1979 for a forceful articulation of this criticism.)\n\n\nOther theorists, by contrast, are more drawn toward the externalist \nshoreline. They emphasize the motivational importance of factors \nother than the agent\u2019s evaluative judgment and the divergences that \ncan result between an agent\u2019s evaluation of her options and her \nmotivation to act. They are thus disinclined to posit any strong, \nnecessary link between evaluative judgment and action. Michael \nStocker, for instance, argues that the philosophical tradition has \nbeen led astray in assuming that evaluation dictates motivation. \n\u201cMotivation and evaluation do not stand in a simple and direct \nrelation to each other, as so often supposed,\u201d he writes. \nRather, \u201ctheir interrelations are mediated by large arrays of \ncomplex psychic structures, such as mood, energy, and interest\u201d\n(1979, pp. 738\u20139). Similarly, Alfred Mele proposes as a \nfundamental and general truth\u2014and one that underlies the \npossibility of akrasia\u2014that \u201cthe motivational \nforce of a want may be out of line with the agent\u2019s evaluation of the\nobject of that want\u201d (1987, p. 37). Mele goes on to offer \nseveral different reasons why the two can come apart: for example, \nrewards perceived as proximate can exert a motivational \ninfluence disproportionate to the value the agent reflectively \nattaches to them (1987, ch. 6). Such wants may function as \nstrong causes even if the agent takes them to constitute \nweak reasons.\n\n With respect to these questions, the challenge sketched at the end of\nSection 1 above remains in full force. What is required is a view\nwhich successfully navigates between the Scylla of an extreme\ninternalism about evaluative judgment which would preclude the\npossibility of weakness of will, and the Charybdis of an extreme\nexternalism which would deny any privileged role to evaluative\njudgment in practical reasoning or rational action. For one\u2019s\nverdict about akrasia will in general be closely connected to\none\u2019s more general views of action, practical reasoning,\nrationality, and evaluative judgment\u2014as was certainly true of\nDavidson.\n\n\nViews that downplay the role of evaluative judgment in action and \nhence tack more toward the externalist side of the channel may more \neasily be able to accept the possibility and indeed the actuality of \nweakness of will. But they are subject to their own challenges. For \nexample, suppose we follow Mele\u2019s image of akrasia and posit\nthat a certain agent is caused to do x by motivation to do \nx which is dramatically out of kilter with her assessment of\nthe merits of doing x. In what sense, then, is her doing \nx free, intentional, and uncompelled? Such an agent might \nseem rather to be at the mercy of a motivational force which is, from\nher point of view, utterly alien. Thus, worries about distinguishing \nakrasia from compulsion come back in full force in \nconnection with proposals like these. (See \n fn. 7\n above for relevant references; Buss and Tenenbaum press these worries\nagainst accounts like Mele\u2019s in particular.) Moreover, there is the \ndanger, for accounts of this more externalist stripe, of taking too \nmuch of the mystery out of weakness of will. Even if akratic action \nis possible and indeed actual, it remains a puzzling, marginal, \nsomehow defective instance of agency, one that we rightly find not \nfully intelligible. Views that do not assign a privileged place in \nrational deliberation and action to the agent\u2019s overall assessment of\nher options risk making akratic action seem no more problematic than \nJulie\u2019s or Jimmy\u2019s decisions, or Hare\u2019s agent who fails to pick up \nthe roundest stone in the vicinity.\n3.2 Weakness of Will as Potentially Rational\n\n\nThe \u201cexternalist turn\u201d toward downplaying the role of an \nagent\u2019s better judgment and emphasizing other psychic factors instead\nis connected to a second way in which some theorists writing after \nDavidson have dissented from his analysis. Davidson, as we saw, \nviewed akratic action as possible, but irrational. The weak-willed \nagent acts contrary to what she herself takes to be the balance of \nreasons; her choice is thus unreasonable by her own lights. On this \npicture, incontinent action is a paradigm case of practical \nirrationality. Many other theorists have agreed with Davidson on this\nscore and have taken akrasia to be perhaps the clearest \nexample of practical irrationality. But some writers (notably Audi \n1990, McIntyre 1990, and Arpaly 2000) have questioned whether akratic\naction is necessarily irrational. Perhaps we ought to leave \nroom, not just for the possibility of akratic action, but \nfor the potential rationality of akratic action.\n\n\nThe irrationality which is held necessarily to attach to akratic \naction derives from the discrepancy between what the agent judges to \nbe the best (or better) thing to do, and what she does. That is, her \naction is faulted as irrational in virtue of not conforming to her \nbetter judgment. But\u2014ask these critics\u2014what if her better\njudgment is itself faulty? There is nothing magical about an agent\u2019s \nbetter judgment that ensures that it is correct, or even warranted; \nlike any other judgment, it can be in error, or even unjustified. \n(Recall that by \u201cbetter judgment\u201d we meant, all along, \nonly \u201ca judgment as to which course of action is better,\u201d\nnot \u201ca superior judgment.\u201d) Where the agent\u2019s \nbetter judgment is itself defective, in doing what she deems herself \nto have insufficient reason to do, the agent may actually be doing \nwhat she has most reason to do. \u201cEven though the akratic agent \ndoes not believe that she is doing what she has most reason to do, it\nmay nevertheless be the case that the course of action that she is \npursuing is the one that she has \u2026 most reason to \npursue\u201d (McIntyre 1990, p. 385). In that sense the \nakratic agent may be wiser than her own better judgment.\n\n\nHow, concretely, could an agent\u2019s better judgment go astray in \nthis way? Perhaps her survey of what she took to be the relevant \nconsiderations did not include, or did not attach sufficient weight \nto, what were in fact significant reasons in favor of one of the \npossible courses of action. She may have overlooked these, or \n(wrongly) deemed them not to be reasons, or failed to appreciate \ntheir full force; and in that case her judgment of what it is best to\ndo will be incorrect. Consider, for example, Jonathan Bennett\u2019s \nHuckleberry Finn (Bennett 1974, discussed in \nMcIntyre 1990), who akratically fails to turn in his slave \nfriend Jim to the authorities. Huck\u2019s judgment that he ought to do \nso, however, was based primarily on what he took to be the force of \nMiss Watson\u2019s property rights; it ignored his powerful feelings of \nfriendship and affection for Jim, as well as other highly relevant \nfactors. His \u201cbetter judgment\u201d was thus not in fact a \nvery comprehensive judgment; it did not take into account the full \nrange of relevant considerations.\n\n\nOr consider Emily, who has always thought it best that she pursue a \nPh.D. in chemistry (Arpaly 2000, p. 504). When she revisits\nthe issue, as she does periodically, she discounts her increasing \nfeelings of restlessness, sadness, and lack of motivation as she \nproceeds in the program, and concludes that she ought to persevere. \nBut in fact she has very good reasons to quit the program\u2014her \ntalents are not well suited to a career in chemistry, and the people \nwho are thriving in the program are very different from her. If she \nimpulsively, akratically quits the program, purely on the basis of \nher feelings, Emily is in fact doing just what she ought to \n do.[13]\n That her action conflicts with her better judgment does not \nsignificantly impugn its rationality, given all the considerations \nthat do support her quitting the program. \u201cA theory of\nrationality should not assume that there is something special about \nan agent\u2019s best judgment. An agent\u2019s best judgment is just another \nbelief\u201d (Arpaly 2000, p. 512). Emily\u2019s action \nconflicts, then, with one belief she has; but it coheres with many \nmore of her beliefs and desires overall. So even though she may find \nher own action inexplicable or \u201csurd,\u201d she is in fact \nacting rationally, although she does not know it. Contra \nDavidson, \u201cwe can \u2026 act rationally just when we cannot \nmake any sense of our actions\u201d (Arpaly 2000, p. 513).\n\n\nIt is unclear, however, whether these arguments and examples are \nlikely to sway those who take akrasia to be a paradigm of \npractical irrationality. These dissenters stress the substantive \nmerits of the course of action the akratic agent follows. But \ntraditionalists may say that is beside the point: however well things\nturn out, the practical thinking of the akratic agent still exhibits \na procedural defect. Someone who flouts her own conclusion \nabout where the balance of reasons lies is ipso facto not \nreasoning well. Even if the action she performs is in fact supported \nby the balance of reasons, she does not think it is, and that is \nenough to show her practical reasoning to be faulty. The defenders of\nthe traditional conception of akrasia as irrational thus \nwish to grant special rational authority (in this procedural sense) \nto the agent\u2019s better judgment, even if they admit that such a \njudgment can be substantively incorrect. By contrast, the dissenters \n\u201c[do] not believe best judgments have any privileged \nrole\u201d (Arpaly 2000, p. 513). We see again the \ncontrast between \u201cinternalist\u201d and \n\u201cexternalist\u201d tendencies in the debates over weakness of \nwill.\n3.3 Changing the Subject\n\n\nA final revisionist strand now emerging in the literature takes the\nagent\u2019s better judgment even farther out of the picture. In an\noutstandingly lucid and stimulating essay published in 1999 (see also\nhis 2009, ch. 4), Richard Holton argued that weakness of will is not\naction contrary to one\u2019s better judgment at all. The literature has\ngone astray in understanding weakness of will in this way; weakness of\nwill is actually quite a different phenomenon, in which the agent\u2019s\nbetter judgment plays no\n role.[14]\n For Holton, when ordinary people speak of weakness of will they have \nin mind a certain kind of failure to act on one\u2019s \nintentions. What matters for weakness of will, then, is not whether\nyou deem another course of action superior at the time of action. It \nis whether you are abandoning an intention you previously formed. \nWeakness of will as the untutored understand it is not \nakrasia (if we reserve that term for action contrary to \none\u2019s better judgment), but rather a certain kind of failure to stick to \none\u2019s plans.[15] \nThis understanding of weakness of will changes the \nsubject in two ways. First, the state of the agent with which the \nweak-willed action is in conflict is not an evaluative judgment (as \nin akrasia) but a different kind of state, namely an \nintention. Second, it is not essential that there be \nsynchronic conflict, as akrasia demands. You must \nact contrary to your present better judgment in order to \nexhibit akrasia; conflict with a previous better \njudgment does not indicate akrasia, but merely a change of \nmind. However, you can exhibit weakness of will as Holton understands\nit simply by abandoning a previously formed intention.\n\n\nOf course not all cases of abandoning or failing to act on a \npreviously formed intention count as weakness of will. I intend \nto run five miles tomorrow evening. If I break my leg tomorrow \nmorning and fail to run five miles tomorrow evening, I will not have \nexhibited weakness of will. How can we characterize \nwhich failures to act on a previously formed intention count\nas weakness of will? Holton\u2019s answer has two parts. First, he says, \nthere is an irreducible normative dimension to the question whether \nsomeone\u2019s abandoning of an intention constituted weakness of will \n(Holton 1999, \n p. 259).[16] \nThat is, there is no purely \ndescriptive criterion (such as whether her action conflicted with her\nbetter judgment) which is sufficient for weakness of will; in order \nto decide whether a given case was an instance of weakness of will we\nmust consider normative questions, such as whether it was \nreasonable for the agent to have abandoned or revised that \nintention, or whether she should have done so. In the case \nof my broken leg, for instance, it was clearly reasonable for me to \nabandon my intention; that is why I could not be charged with \nweakness of will in that case.\n\n\nSecond, says Holton, we need to attend to an important subclass of \nour intentions to do something at a future time, namely \ncontrary-inclination-defeating intentions, or, as he\nlater terms them (Holton 2003), resolutions. \nResolutions are intentions that are formed precisely in order to \ninsulate one against contrary inclinations one expects to feel when \nthe time comes. Thus one reason I might form an intention on Monday \nto run five miles on Tuesday\u2014as opposed to leaving the issue \nopen until Tuesday, for decision then\u2014is to reduce the effect \nof feelings of lassitude to which I fear I may be subject when \nTuesday rolls around. Then suppose Tuesday rolls around; I am indeed \nprey to feelings of lassitude; and I decide as a result not to run. \nNow I can be charged with weakness of will. Weakness of will\ninvolves, specifically, a failure to act on a resolution; \nthis is sufficient to differentiate weakness of will from mere change\nof mind and even from caprice (which is a different species \nof unreasonable intention revision, according to Holton).\n\n\nAs a later paper by Alison McIntyre shows (McIntyre 2006), \nunderstanding weakness of will in this way casts a fresh light on the\nissue of its rational status. The weak-willed agent abandons a \nresolution because of a contrary inclination of exactly the type \nwhich the resolution was expressly designed to defeat. Therefore, as \nMcIntyre underlines, weak-willed action always involves a procedural \nrational \n defect:[17]\n a technique of self-management has been deployed but has failed \n(McIntyre 2006, p. 296). To that extent we have grounds to \ncriticize weak-willed action simply in virtue of the second of the \nways in which Holton wishes to distinguish weakness of will from a \nmere change of mind, without even resolving the potentially murky \nissue of whether the agent was reasonable in abandoning her \nintention.\n\n\nMcIntyre holds, however, that it would be overstating the case to say\nthat because weakness of will involves this procedural defect, it is \nalways irrational (McIntyre 2006, p. 290; \npp. 298\u20139; p. 302). She proposes rather that \npractical rationality has multiple facets and aims, and that failure \nin one respect or along one dimension does not automatically justify \nthe especially severe form of rational criticism which we intend by \nthe term \u201cirrational.\u201d For example, consider an agent who\nsuccumbs to contrary inclination of exactly the type expected when \nthe time comes to act on a truly stupid resolution. (Holton \ngives the example of resolving to go without water for two days just \nto see what it feels like: Holton 2003, p. 42.) There will \nindeed be a blemish on this agent\u2019s rational scorecard if he \neventually gives in and drinks: he will have failed in his attempt at\nself-management. But wouldn\u2019t it be rationally far worse for\nhim to stick to his silly resolution no matter what the cost?\n\n\nWe can also re-examine the issue of the rationality of \nakrasia in light of this analysis of weakness of will; for \nwe can distinguish between akratic and non-akratic cases of the \nlatter. As McIntyre points out, resolutions typically rest on \njudgments about what it is best that one do at a (future) time \nt. If an agent fails to act on a previously formed \nresolution to do a at t, thus exhibiting weakness \nof will, we can distinguish the case in which he still endorses at \nt the judgment that it is best that he do a at \nt (even though he does not do it) from the case in which he \nabandons that judgment as well as his resolution. In the latter, \nnon-akratic type of case, the agent in effect rationalizes his \nfailure to live up to his resolution by deciding that it is not after\nall best that he do a at t. McIntyre points out \nthat the traditional view that akrasia is always irrational \nseems to give us a perverse incentive to rationalize, since in that \ncase we escape the grave charge of practical irrationality, being \nleft only with the procedural practical defect present in all cases \nof weakness of will (McIntyre 2006, p. 291). But this seems\nimplausible: are the two sub-cases so radically different in their \nrational status? Indeed, she argues, if anything, akratic weakness of\nwill is typically rationally preferable to rationalizing \nweakness of will (McIntyre 2006, p. 287; pp. 309ff.). \n\u201cIn the presence of powerful contrary inclinations that bring \nabout a failure to be resolute,\u201d she writes, \u201cresisting \nrationalization and remaining clearheaded about one\u2019s reasons to act \ncan constitute a modest accomplishment\u201d (McIntyre 2006, \np. 311). Have we witnessed the transformation of \nakrasia from impossible, to irrational, to downright \nadmirable?\n3.4 Recent Developments\n3.4.1 Epistemic Akrasia\n\nOne focus of renewed attention in recent years has been (so-called)\nepistemic akrasia. An epistemically akratic agent holds beliefs of the\nform \u201cP, but my evidence doesn\u2019t support P.\u201d In an\ninfluential discussion, Sophie Horowitz posits an analogy between\nepistemic akrasia and practical akrasia: \u201cJust as an akratic\nagent acts in a way she believes she ought not act, an epistemically\nakratic agent believes something that she believes is unsupported by\nher evidence\u201d (Horowitz 2014, p. 718).\n\nIs epistemic akrasia possible? Some philosophers who are happy to\ncountenance practical akrasia have answered in the negative with\nrespect to its putative doxastic analogue (these include Hurley 1989,\nAdler 2002, and Owens 2002). One argument for this denial focuses on\nthe notion of doxastic control. David Owens argues that we lack the\nrequisite sort of doxastic control required for our beliefs to be\nformed freely and deliberately, \u201ceither in accordance with our\njudgement about what we should believe or against those\njudgements\u201d (Owens 2002, p. 395). But such control, Owens\nargues, would be necessary in order for epistemic akrasia to be\npossible.\n\nA second argument for the impossibility of epistemic akrasia\n(discussed in Adler 2002) turns on what is seen as an important\ndisanalogy between epistemic and practical reasoning. Conflict between\ntwo incompatible beliefs weakens one or both beliefs (since both\ncan\u2019t be true), whereas conflict between two desires that\ncan\u2019t both be satisfied need not weaken either desire. A\npractically akratic agent who has formed an all things considered\njudgment about what to do may thus still be in the grip of a desire to\ndo something else. But this, Adler says, has no analogue in the\nepistemic realm: one can\u2019t remain in the grip of a belief if one\nviews the evidence for an opposing belief as decisive. Thus, practical\nakrasia is \u201cmotivationally intelligible\u201d in a way that\nepistemic akrasia is not (Adler 2002, p. 8). Neil Levy responds to\nthis concern by arguing that while beliefs in some domains fit this\nmodel, the disanalogy Adler points to does not hold in domains where\nthere is room for \u201congoing, rational controversy,\u201d\nincluding philosophy (Levy 2004, p. 156). One may form a belief in\nfavor of a philosophical view while nonetheless feeling the pull of\nincompatible views, just as one may retain a desire that one judges\nall things considered one shouldn\u2019t satisfy. Though Levy only\nclaims that Adler\u2019s impossibility argument fails, Ribeiro (2011)\nuses similar considerations to motivate the claim that epistemic\nakrasia is not only possible, but actual.\n\nSome philosophers who think there could be an epistemic version of\nakrasia have raised questions about how closely it would parallel\npractical akrasia. Daniel Greco (2014), for instance, argues that\nwhile a divergence between one\u2019s moral emotions and one\u2019s\nurges might play an important role in understanding some cases of\npractical akrasia, there are no corresponding epistemic emotions that\nwould help to illuminate epistemic akrasia (Greco 2014,\np. 207). Practical and epistemic varieties of akrasia nonetheless have\nin common that they involve a kind of fragmentation or inner conflict;\nGreco uses this characterization to support the idea that both\nepistemic and practical akrasia are always irrational. (Feldman 2005\nalso sees epistemic akrasia as a paradigm of irrationality.)\n\nJust as the rational status of practical akrasia has become contested\n(see section 3.2 above), however, some theorists have now argued that\nepistemic akrasia could in fact be rational. For example, Coates\n(2012), Weatherson (2019), Wedgwood (2011), and Lasonen-Aarnio (2014)\nhave argued for the rational permissibility of some beliefs of the\ncharacteristic akratic form \u201cP, but my evidence doesn\u2019t\nsupport P.\u201d This discussion has been shaped by a growing\ninterest in higher-order evidence\u2014that is, evidence about what\none\u2019s evidence supports. The notion of higher-order evidence\ncomplicates the picture of belief at work in arguments like\nAdler\u2019s (2002) above. Defenders of the rationality of epistemic\nakrasia have argued that beliefs of the form \u201cP, but my evidence\ndoesn\u2019t support P\u201d can be rationally permissible when one\nhas misleading higher-order evidence. In such cases, they contend, a\nperson could have good grounds both for believing that P and for\nbelieving that her evidence doesn\u2019t support the conclusion that\nP.\n\nFor instance, Horowitz describes a case of epistemic akrasia involving\na detective, Sam, who stays up all night trying to identify a\nthief. He knows the evidence he is working with is good, and concludes\non the basis of this evidence that the thief was Lucy. He calls his\npartner and tells her that he\u2019s cracked the case, only to have\nher remind him that his reasoning while sleepy is often poor. Sam\nhadn\u2019t thought about his previous track record, but he believes\nhis partner that he\u2019s often wrong about what his evidence\nsupports when he\u2019s tired. (Horowitz 2014, p. 719).\n\nDefenders would say that Sam could be rational in believing both that\nLucy was the thief, and in believing that his evidence doesn\u2019t\nsupport that claim. Against this view, Horowitz (2014) maintains that\nhigher-order evidence should affect our first-order attitudes whenever\nwe expect our evidence to be truth-guiding (which rationally we almost\nalways should); the conjunction involved in an akratic belief is thus\nrationally unstable (Horowitz 2014, p. 740). (See also Lasonen-Aarnio\n2020 for the argument that epistemically akratic subjects, while\nsometimes rational, nonetheless manifest bad dispositions).\n3.4.2 Addiction as Akrasia?\n\n\nThere has also been growing interest in the question of whether\naddiction is perhaps best understood as a form of akrasia.\nBuilding on the arguments of Mele (2002), Nick Heather (2016) contends\nthat addiction shares the core features of akratic action and should be\nunderstood as a special kind of akrasia, one in which agents\nconsistently act against both their present judgments and their prior\nresolutions (Heather 2016 p. 133\u20134). Heather thus accepts\nHolton\u2019s (1999) distinction between akrasia and weakness\nof will, but argues that addiction paradigmatically involves both\nhalves of this distinction.\n\n\nIn contrast, Edmund Henden (2016) argues against classifying\naddiction as a form of weakness of will. He thinks that the\nphenomenology of addiction tells against such an assimilation.\nAddiction often involves habitual behavior, and relapses are often\ntriggered by environmental cues that the addict is not conscious of at\nthe time of action. Addicts may continue to take drugs even when they\ndon\u2019t find it pleasurable to do so, and while retaining a strong\nsense of the disvalue of this course of action (Henden 2016, p. 122).\nIn these respects, Henden contends that addiction is unlike giving into\ntemptation, as paradigm examples of akrasia are often\ndescribed.\n\n\nHenden also notes that weakness of will seems rationally\ncriticizable in a way that addiction does not, which suggests they\ncan\u2019t be the same phenomenon. Many addicts sincerely try very\nhard to abstain from using drugs. Though their effort may be\ninsufficient for them to succeed in abstaining, it may nonetheless be\nsufficient relative to ordinary standards. That is, if someone who was\nnot an addict made the same effort with respect to similar endeavors,\nit would be reasonable to expect her to succeed. The challenges that\nface addicts thus seem much more demanding than the challenges that\nface the average practical agent, including those prone to\nakrasia (Henden 2016, p. 123\u20134).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adler, J.
