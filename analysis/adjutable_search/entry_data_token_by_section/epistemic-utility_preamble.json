    "main_text": "\n\nIf I believe George Eliot wrote more than six novels and also believe\nshe wrote fewer than four, you will no doubt judge my beliefs\nirrational. After all, if she did write more than six, she\ndidn\u2019t write fewer than four. And similarly, if my degree of\nbelief that Eliot wrote more than six novels is greater than my degree\nof belief that she wrote more than five, then again you will think me\nirrational. After all, if she did write more than six, she also wrote\nmore than five. In both cases, there is a general norm I fail to\nsatisfy. In the first, it might be this:\n\n\nConsistency\\(_2\\) If two propositions cannot both be\ntrue together, you should not believe both.\n\n\nIn the second case, it might be this:\n\n\nNo Drop If one proposition entails another, then your\ndegree of belief in the first should not exceed your degree of belief\nin the second.\n\n\nThis entry is concerned with norms like these. More specifically, it\nis concerned with how we might establish these norms. More\nspecifically still, it is concerned with what epistemologists have\ncome to call epistemic utility arguments in their favor. The\nnorms we seek to establish primarily govern epistemic states;\nthat is, they say what rationality requires of your beliefs, degrees\nof belief, and any other attitudes whose role it is to represent the\nway the world is. But, as we will see, they also govern the activities\nby which we acquire those states, such as gathering and responding to\nevidence.\n\nEpistemic utility arguments are inspired by traditional utility-based\narguments in decision theory, so let\u2019s begin with a quick\nsummary of those. Traditional decision theory explores a particular\nstrategy for establishing the norms that govern which choices it is\nrational for an individual to make in a particular situation (see\nentry on\n normative theories of rational choice: expected utility).\n Given such a situation, the framework for the theory includes:\nstates of the world described in as much detail as required;\nactions that are available to the individual in the\nsituation, and the individual\u2019s utility function, which\ntakes a state of the world and an action and returns a measure of the\nextent to which she values the outcome of performing that action at\nthat world. We call this measure the utility of the outcome\nat the world. For example, there might be just two relevant states of\nthe world: one in which it rains and one in which it doesn\u2019t.\nAnd there might be just two relevant actions from which to choose:\ntake an umbrella when you leave the house or don\u2019t. Then your\nutility function will measure how much you value the outcomes of each\naction at each state of the world: that is, it will give the value of\nbeing in the rain without an umbrella, being in the rain with an\numbrella, being with an umbrella when there is no rain, and being\nwithout an umbrella when there is no rain. With this framework in\nhand, we can state certain very general norms of action in terms of\nit. For instance, if one action has strictly greater utility than\nanother in every possible state of the world, we say the first\nstrongly dominates the second, and the norm of Dominance says\nthat you should not choose a strongly dominated action.\n\nIn epistemic utility theory, the states of the world remain the same,\nbut the possible actions an individual might perform are replaced by\nthe possible epistemic states she might be in, and the\nutility function is replaced by an epistemic utility\nfunction, which takes a state of the world and an epistemic state\nand returns a measure of the purely epistemic value of that epistemic\nstate at that state of the world. So, in epistemic utility theory, we\nappeal to epistemic utility to ask which of a range of possible\nepistemic states it is rational to be in, just as in traditional\nutility theory we appeal to non-epistemic, pragmatic utility to ask\nwhich of a range of possible actions it is rational to perform. (In\nfact, we will often talk of epistemic disutility rather than\nepistemic utility in this entry. But it is easy to translate between\nthem: the negative of an epistemic utility function is an epistemic\ndisutility function, and vice versa.)\n\nAgain, certain very general norms may be stated, such as the obvious\nanalogue of Dominance from above: if one epistemic state has greater\nepistemic utility than another in every possible state of the world,\nthen it is irrational to be in the latter. And we might use them to\nestablish norms for epistemic states. For instance, consider\nConsistency\\(_2\\) from the introduction. Let\u2019s say the epistemic\nutility of believing a truth is some positive number \\(R\\), while the\nepistemic utility of believing a falsehood is some negative number\n\\(-W\\) (\\(R\\) for Right, \\(W\\) for Wrong). And\nlet\u2019s say the epistemic utility of a set of beliefs is just the\nsum of the epistemic utilities of the individual beliefs that belong\nto it, so that if you believe two truths and a falsehood, for\ninstance, your epistemic utility is \\(2R - W\\). Now suppose that \\(W\\)\nis greater than \\(R\\); that is, the badness of believing falsely is\ngreater than the goodness of believing truly; that is, we more\nstrongly wish to avoid false belief than we want to achieve true\nbelief; that is, our epistemic utilities encode a sort of epistemic\nconservatism. Then, if I believe each of two propositions that cannot\nboth be true together, my total epistemic utility is either \\(R-W\\),\nif one is true and the other false, or \\(-2W\\) if neither is true. And\neach of these is less than zero. So suspending judgment on both is\nguaranteed to be better than believing both. And so, by Dominance,\nbelieving both is irrational and we have an epistemic utility argument\nfor Consistency\\(_2\\). This is the style of argument we will consider\nin this entry. As we\u2019ll see in\n Section 5.2,\n there is an argument from Dominance to No Drop as well.\n\nBecause we appeal to the purely epistemic utility of the\nepistemic states we consider, rather than the pragmatic or\npractical utility of the outcomes of the choices they lead us\nto make, the arguments of epistemic utility theory are different from\nbetting arguments or dutch book arguments for epistemic norms (Ramsey\n1926 [1931]; de Finetti 1937 [1980]; see entry on\n dutch book arguments).\n They are also different from the sort of axiomatic justification\nexemplified by Cox's theorem (Cox 1946, 1961; Paris 1994) as well as\nthe sort of structural justification given by R. I. G. Hughes and Bas\nvan Fraassen (1984) and Hannes Leitgeb (2021).\n",
