    "main_text": "\n\nFoundationalism is a view about the structure of (epistemic)\njustification or knowledge. The foundationalist\u2019s thesis in\nshort is that (a) there are some \u201cbasic\u201d or\n\u201cfoundational\u201d beliefs that have a positive epistemic\nstatus\u2014e.g., they count as justified or as\nknowledge\u2014without depending on any other beliefs for this\nstatus, and (b) any other beliefs with a positive epistemic status\nmust depend, ultimately, on foundational beliefs for this status. \n\nMany interesting and difficult questions can be raised about the\nrelation between justification and knowledge, including whether\nknowledge should be analyzed in terms of justification, as\nepistemologists traditionally seem to have thought, or whether\nknowledge is prior to or independent of\n justification.[1]\n In what follows we will concentrate on foundationalism about\njustification, though much of what we say also applies to\nfoundationalism about knowledge.\n\nA little reflection suggests that the vast majority of the\npropositions that we know or are justified in believing have that\nstatus only because we know or are justified in believing other\npropositions. So, for example, I am justified in believing that there\nis at least one dog in our neighborhood, because I am justified in\nbelieving that my next door neighbor has a dog; I am justified in\nbelieving that our garbage will get picked up tomorrow, because I am\njustified in believing that tomorrow is Tuesday and that our garbage\ngets picked up every Tuesday; and I am justified in believing that\nthere is going to be at least some rain in the next week, because I am\njustified in believing that the forecast calls for a good deal of\nrain, and that forecasts are almost always right when it comes to\nsimilar short-term forecasts in this area. And the dependence seems to\nbe inferential in nature: in each case, I am justified in believing\nthe former only because I have inferred it, or at least am able to\ninfer it, from the latter. Foundationalists about justification want\nto contrast my foundationally justified belief (knowledge) with a kind\nof justified belief (knowledge) that doesn\u2019t involve the having\nof other justified beliefs (knowledge). There is no standard\nterminology for what we shall henceforth refer to as foundational\njustification\n (knowledge).[2]\n\nWe just noted that the epistemic dependence of one belief on another\nin the above examples seems to be a kind of inferential\ndependence. Epistemologists do tend to assume that all epistemic\ndependence between beliefs is inferential. But perhaps not all\nrelations of epistemic or justificatory dependence between beliefs are\ninferential. When I form an introspective belief about a conscious or\noccurrent belief of mine -- e.g., my belief that I believe it\u2019s\nraining outside -- perhaps (on some views) my second-order\nbelief\u2019s justification depends on my having the conscious belief\nthat it is raining. Many would take such introspective beliefs to be\n\u201cfoundational\u201d, akin to my justification for beliefs about\nmy own present experiences. One way to make sense of this is that even\nif such beliefs depend for their justification on the first-order\nbeliefs, they are foundational in the sense of not depending\npositively on the epistemic or justificatory status of other\nbeliefs. (Notice that my belief that I believe that it is raining\noutside doesn\u2019t depend for its justification on whether I\u2019m\njustified in believing that it\u2019s raining outside.) This suggests\nthat we understand foundational beliefs as those that do not depend on\nthe epistemic status of other beliefs, and non-foundational beliefs as\nbeliefs that do so depend. And if we think that any dependence of a\nbelief on the epistemic status of another belief must be\ninferential, we get the neat result that foundational beliefs\ndo not, but non-foundational beliefs do, depend for their\njustification on inferential relations to other beliefs. But is it\npossible for a belief to depend on the epistemic status of other\nbeliefs, but in a non-inferential way? We will briefly illustrate how\nsome accounts might accept the possibility of non-inferential\nepistemic dependence between beliefs further below, when we discuss\ncoherentism and reliabilism. However, aside from such cases, we will\ntreat \u201cfoundational/nonfoundational\u201d justification and the\n\u201cnoninferential/inferential\u201d justification as\ninterchangeable.\n\nEpistemologists commonly distinguish between doxastic and\npropositional justification. Very roughly, one has\npropositional justification when one has justification (e.g.,\nsome reason or evidence) for belief in a proposition. One has doxastic\njustification when one not only has justification to believe a\nproposition but also believes the proposition and believes it\non the basis of the justification one has. This distinction\napplies to foundational and non-foundational beliefs: being\nfoundationally/non-foundationally justified in believing that P\nrequires having some foundational/non-foundational justification for\nP, and believing that P on the basis of this justification. (While\nthis is to understand doxastic justification in terms of propositional\njustification, some prefer to go the other way round, and understand\nhaving justification in terms of being in a position to acquire\ndoxastic justification. For a helpful discussion, see Turri 2010.) For\nease of exposition, much of our discussion is put in terms that most\nnaturally refer to doxastic justification\u2014e.g., \u201cjustified\nbelief\u201d, \u201cbeing justified in believing\u201d. However,\neven when we use such terms, we focus on propositional justification\n(which is required for doxastic justification) and assume that the\nother conditions involved in believing on a proper basis are\nsatisfied. (For more on the basing requirement, see the entry on\n the epistemic basing relation.)\n",
