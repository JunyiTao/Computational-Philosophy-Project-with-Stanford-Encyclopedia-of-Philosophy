    "main_text": "Substance Dualism\n3. Substance Dualism\n\nLa Forge was among the first commentators to attribute to Descartes\nan unambiguous dualism of mind and body. He defined a substance as\n\u2018a thing in which some property, quality or attribute (of which\nwe have a real idea in ourselves) resides immediately as in a subject\nand by which it exists\u2019 (H preface \u00f93). His\nRemarks were designed to extend the explanatory scope of the\nmachine model of the body to include all the actions of non-human\nanimals and, in the case of the human body, to explain how ideas arise\nin the brain, how they are stored in memory, and how they are\nre-activated in the imagination. Accordingly, he initially used the\nword \u2018idea\u2019, as Descartes had done, to refer to the\nbrain-states that are associated with the occurrence of thoughts in the\nmind (H 262), and he defined memory as the physical capacity\nof the brain to facilitate the repeated occurrence of such traces.\nSince the relevant brain-events were understood as patterns in the flow\nof animal spirits, memory was explained as an acquired disposition of\nthe paths through which animal spirits flowed to re-open on subsequent\noccasions when appropriately stimulated (Sutton 1998).\n\n Memory,\nwhich consists in nothing else, when considered from the perspective of\nthe body, than the facility which remains in the pores [of the brain]\nwhich had been opened previously to re-open subsequently.\n(H 304; cf. T 280\u201381: THM 178)\n\n\nThis Cartesian use of the term \u2018idea\u2019 was ambiguous,\nsince it referred to thoughts in the mind and the brain-states that\naccompany them. For that reason, La Forge decided in the\nTreatise to restrict the use of the term to thoughts, and to\nrename physical ideas in the brain as \u2018corporeal species\u2019\n(T 158, 256; THM 77, 159).\n\nAccording to this theory, the delicate fluid material called\n\u2018animal spirits\u2019 functions in a quasi-hydraulic machine\n(T 279; THM 177). Impressions on the external senses\nare transmitted to the \u2018common sense\u2019 in the brain, and the\npatterns in which animal spirits emerge from the brain in response to\nexternal stimuli are corporeal species. All voluntary or involuntary\nbodily actions, such as walking or blinking, are explained by the\nmotion of animal spirits from the brain to the muscles, while internal\nsensations (such as hunger or thirst) are likewise experienced by the\nsubject as a result of associated motions of animal spirits in the\nopposite direction, from other parts of the body to the brain. Even the\npassions or emotions are triggered by similar mechanisms. Thus\neverything that occurs in a human body may be explained by the motion\nof various kinds of matter in its various parts (e.g., the brain,\nnervous system, or the veins and arteries). The only exception in human\nnature to this type of physiological explanation, i.e., thought, was\nreserved exclusively to the mind.\n\nLa Forge began the Trait\u00e9 (1666) with a lengthy\npreface in which he compared Descartes\u2019 theory of the human mind with\nthat of Augustine, from whom he quoted extensively to show\nthat the mind is a distinct substance that is immaterial and survives\nthe death of the body. This immaterial substance has two characteristic\nproperties, by which alone it is known: understanding and willing. The\nunderstanding can generate ideas or conceptions of realities that have\nnever been observed or imagined, and to that extent it is independent\nof the human body. Pure understanding \u2018is a faculty which is\nindependent of the body in the same way as the will is\u2019\n(T 292; THM 188).\n\nThus ideas originate in the mind in two distinct ways: in one case,\nthey are triggered by sensations, and in the other they arise without\nany corresponding bodily stimulus. However, La Forge also repeated\nDescartes\u2019 theory of the origin of ideas, according to which all\nideas are innate (in some sense) in the mind. He identified the \u2018principal and effective\u2019 cause of ideas as the mind, while bodily\nsensations were described as the \u2018remote and occasional\u2019 causes of some ideas. The\nargument here seemed to depend on the dissimilarity between the body and\nthe mind:\n\n\nAlthough one could say that the bodies that surround our bodies\n\u2026 are in some sense the cause of the ideas we then have \u2026\nbecause these are material substances, the action of which does not\nextend to the soul insofar as it is simply a thing which thinks\n\u2026 they cannot be more than their remote and occasional causes\nwhich, by the union of mind and body, cause our faculty to think and\ndetermines it to produce ideas of which the faculty of thinking itself\nis the principal and effective cause. (T 176; THM\n92)\n\n\nThe mind is thus an active cause of all its own ideas, including\nthose that it generates on the occasion of being stimulated by the\nsenses. In that sense, all ideas are innate because the mind is their\nprincipal and effective cause.\n\nThe will is equally active; it is an\n\n active power \u2026 of\nchoosing or determining ourselves from within ourselves to everything\nto which we determine ourselves. (T 182; THM\n97)\n\n La Forge argued that, in addition to understanding and willing,\nthe human mind must have an intellectual memory; since it can reason\nabout purely spiritual realities, and since reasoning involves moving\nfrom one step to another and remembering those on which one relies for\nprogress, the human mind must be capable of remembering purely\nspiritual concepts of which it has had no corresponding corporeal\nspecies (T 291; THM 187). La Forge concludes in\nChapter xxv that the human mind is immortal; since its essence is to\nthink, the mind continues to think constantly for eternity and may also\nremember things that do not presuppose the presence of a body.\n\nThe stark definition of the human mind and body as distinct, simple\nsubstances did not prevent La Forge from describing their union in\nhuman nature as a \u2018composite subject\u2019 (T 112;\nTHM 39) and as \u2018a unity of composition and\nassociation\u2019 (T 98; THM 28). It is known from\nexperience that there is some kind of union involved here, which\nDescartes had struggled to describe in terms of an intermingling of two\nsubstances. La Forge describes it more analytically in causal terms; it\nconsists in\n\n a mutual and reciprocal dependence of thoughts of\none of them on the movements of the other, and in the mutual\ninteraction of their actions and passions. (T 210;\nTHM 122)\n\n\nLa Forge frequently describes this interaction in causal terms,\napparently without qualification or reservation. Accordingly, external\nbodies that interact with our sensory organs \u2018cause\u2019\nsensations in us; the motions of external stimuli are the \u2018true\ncauses\u2019 of our sensory perceptions (T 165, 326;\nTHM 83, 215). The interaction of mind and body is reciprocal,\n\n\nfor not only can the body stimulate (exciter) various\nthoughts in the mind, but the mind can also cause (causer)\nvarious movements in the body. (T 215; THM\n126)\n\n In general, the link between the human mind and body\n\n must\nconsist in the relation or concurrence of the actions and passions of\nthe mind and body. (T 212; THM 124)\n\n\nCritics of substance dualism claimed, or assumed without argument,\nthat it concealed an explanatory gap, since it failed to explain how\ntwo substances that were so dissimilar could interact causally with\neach other. La Forge addressed that issue in Chapter XVI of the\nTrait\u00e9.\n",
