    "main_text": "Problems of reduction || Reduction relation between theories\n4.1 Reduction relation between theories\n\nPart of the structuralistic program is the definition of various\nintertheoretic relations. Here we will concentrate on the relation(s)\nof \u201creduction\u201d, which play an important r\u00f4le in the\nphilosophical discourse as well as in the work of the physicists,\nalbeit not under this name. Consider a theory \\(T\\) which is\nsuperseded by a better theory \\(T'\\). One could use \\(T'\\) in order to\nunderstand some of the successes and failures of \\(T\\). If there is\nsome systematic way of deriving \\(T\\) as an approximation within\n\\(T'\\), then \\(T\\) is \u201creduced\u201d to or by \\(T'\\). In this\ncase, \\(T\\) is successful where it is a good approximation to \\(T'\\)\nand \\(T'\\) is successful. On the other hand, in situations where\n\\(T'\\) is still successful but \\(T\\) is a poor approximation to\n\\(T'\\), \\(T\\) will fail. For example, classical mechanics should be\nobtained as the limiting case of relativistic mechanics for velocities\nsmall compared with the velocity of light. This would explain why\nclassical mechanics was, and is still, successfully applied in the\ncase of small velocities but fails for large (relative)\nvelocities.\n\nAs mentioned, the investigation of such reduction relations between\ndifferent theories is part of the every-day work of theoretical\nphysicists, but usually they do not adopt a general concept of\nreduction. Rather they intuitively decide what has to be shown or to\nbe calculated, depending on the case under consideration. Here the\nwork of the structuralists could lead to a more systematic approach\nwithin physics, although there does not yet exist a generally\naccepted, unique concept of reduction.\n",
