    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Pythagoras || The Pythagorean Way of Life\n5. Was Pythagoras a Mathematician or Cosmologist?\n\n\nIn the modern world Pythagoras is most of all famous as a\nmathematician, because of the theorem named after him, and secondarily\nas a cosmologist, because of the striking view of a universe ascribed\nto him in the later tradition, in which the heavenly bodies produce\n\u201cthe music of the spheres\u201d by their movements. It should\nbe clear from the discussion above that, while the early evidence\nshows that Pythagoras was indeed one of the most famous early Greek\nthinkers, there is no indication in that evidence that his fame was\nprimarily based on mathematics or cosmology. Neither Plato nor\nAristotle treats Pythagoras as having contributed to the development\nof Presocratic cosmology, although Aristotle in particular discusses\nthe topic in some detail in the first book of the Metaphysics\nand elsewhere. Aristotle evidently knows of no cosmology of Pythagoras\nthat antedates the cosmological system of the \u201cso-called\nPythagoreans,\u201d which he dates to the middle of the fifth\ncentury, and which is found in the fragments of Philolaus. There is\nalso no mention of Pythagoras\u2019 work in geometry or of the Pythagorean\ntheorem in the early evidence. Dicaearchus comments that \u201cwhat\nhe said to his associates no one can say reliably,\u201d but then\nidentifies four doctrines that became well known: 1) that the soul is\nimmortal; 2) that it transmigrates into other kinds of animals; 3)\nthat after certain intervals the things that have happened once happen\nagain, so that nothing is completely new; 4) that all animate beings\nbelong to the same family (Porphyry, VP 19). Thus, for\nDicaearchus too, it is not as a mathematician or Presocratic writer on\nnature that Pythagoras is famous. It might not be too surprising that\nPlato, Aristotle and Dicaearchus do not mention Pythagoras\u2019 work in\nmathematics, because they are not primarily dealing with the history\nof mathematics. On the other hand, Aristotle\u2019s pupil Eudemus did write\na history of geometry in the fourth century and what we find in\nEudemus is very significant. A substantial part of Eudemus\u2019 overview\nof the early history of Greek geometry is preserved in the prologue to\nProclus\u2019 commentary on Book One of Euclid\u2019s Elements (p. 65,\n12 ff.), which was written much later, in the fifth century CE.  At\nfirst sight, it appears that Eudemus did assign Pythagoras a\nsignificant place in the history of geometry. Eudemus is reported as\nbeginning with Thales and an obscure figure named Mamercus, but the\nthird person mentioned by Proclus in this report is Pythagoras,\nimmediately before Anaxagoras. There is no mention of the Pythagorean\ntheorem, but Pythagoras is said to have transformed the philosophy of\ngeometry into a form of liberal education, to have investigated its\ntheorems in an immaterial and intellectual way and specifically to\nhave discovered the study of irrational magnitudes and the\nconstruction of the five regular solids. Unfortunately close\nexamination of the section on Pythagoras in Proclus\u2019 prologue reveals\nnumerous difficulties and shows that it comes not from Eudemus but\nfrom Iamblichus with some additions by Proclus himself (Burkert 1972a,\n409 ff.). The first clause is taken word for word from Iamblichus\u2019\nOn Common Mathematical Science (p. 70.1 Festa). Proclus\nelsewhere quotes long passages from Iamblichus and is doing the same\nhere. As Burkert points out, however, as soon as we recognize that\nProclus has inserted a passage from Iamblichus into Eudemus\u2019 history,\nwe must also recognize that Proclus was driven to do so by the lack of\nany mention of Pythagoras in Eudemus. Even those who want to assign\nPythagoras a larger role in early Greek mathematics recognize that\nmost of what Proclus says here cannot go back to Eudemus (Zhmud 2012a,\n263\u2013266). Thus, not only is Pythagoras not commonly known as a\ngeometer in the time of Plato and Aristotle, but also the most\nauthoritative history of early Greek geometry assigns him no role in\nthe history of geometry in the overview preserved in\nProclus. According to Proclus, Eudemus did report that two\npropositions, which are later found in Euclid\u2019s Elements,\nwere discoveries of the Pythagoreans (Proclus 379 and 419). Eudemus\ndoes not assign the discoveries to any specific Pythagorean, and they\nare hard to date. The discoveries might be as early as Hippasus in the\nmiddle of the fifth century, who is associated with a group of\nPythagoreans known as the\nmathematici, who arose after Pythagoras\u2019 death (see\nbelow). The crucial point to note is that Eudemus does not assign\nthese discoveries to Pythagoras himself. The first Pythagorean whom we\ncan confidently identify as an accomplished mathematician is Archytas\nin the late fifth and the first half of the fourth century.\n\n\nAre we to conclude, then, that Pythagoras had nothing to do with\nmathematics or cosmology? The evidence is not quite that simple. The\ntradition regarding Pythagoras\u2019 connection to the Pythagorean theorem\nreveals the complexity of the problem. None of the early sources,\nincluding Plato, Aristotle and their pupils shows any knowledge of\nPythagoras\u2019 connection to the theorem.  Almost a thousand years later,\nin the fifth century CE, Proclus, in his commentary on Euclid\u2019s proof\nof the theorem (Elements I. 47), gives the following report:\n\u201cIf we listen to those who wish to investigate ancient history,\nit is possible to find them referring this theorem back to Pythagoras\nand saying that he sacrificed an ox upon its discovery\u201d\n(426.6). Proclus gives no indication of his source, but a number of\nother late reports (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 12; Athenaeus 418f;\nPlutarch, Moralia 1094b) show that it ultimately relied on\ntwo lines of verse whose context is unknown: \u201cWhen Pythagoras\nfound that famous diagram, in honor of which he offered a glorious\nsacrifice of oxen...\u201d The author of these verses is variously\nidentified as Apollodorus the calculator or Apollodorus the\narithmetician. This Apollodorus probably dates before Cicero, who\nalludes to the story (On the Nature of the Gods III. 88),\nand, if he can be identified with Apollodorus of Cyzicus, the follower\nof Democritus, the story would go back to the fourth century BCE\n(Burkert 1972a, 428). Two lines of poetry of indeterminate date are\nobviously a very slender support upon which to base Pythagoras\u2019\nreputation as a geometer, but they cannot be simply ignored. Several\nthings need to be noted about this tradition, however, in order to\nunderstand its true significance.  First, Proclus does not ascribe a\nproof of the theorem to Pythagoras but rather goes on to contrast\nPythagoras as one of those \u201cknowing the truth of the\ntheorem\u201d with Euclid who not only gave the proof found in\nElements I.47 but also a more general proof in\nVI. 31. Although a number of modern scholars have speculated on what\nsort of proof Pythagoras might have used (e.g., Heath 1956, 352 ff.),\nit is important to note that there is not a jot of evidence for a\nproof by Pythagoras; what we know of the history of Greek geometry\nmakes such a proof by Pythagoras improbable, since the first work on\nthe elements of geometry, upon which a rigorous proof would be based,\nis not attested until Hippocrates of Chios, who was active after\nPythagoras in the latter part of the fifth century (Proclus, A\nCommentary on the First Book of Euclid\u2019s Elements, 66). All that\nthis tradition ascribes to Pythagoras, then, is discovery of the truth\ncontained in the theorem. The truth may not have been in general form\nbut rather focused on the simplest such triangle (with sides 3, 4 and\n5), pointing out that such a triangle and all others like it will have\na right angle. Modern scholarship has shown, moreover, that long\nbefore Pythagoras the Babylonians were aware of the basic Pythagorean\nrule and could generate Pythagorean triples (integers that satisfy the\nPythagorean rule such as 3, 4 and 5), although they never formulated\nthe theorem in explicit form or proved it (H\u00f8yrup 1999, 401\u20132, 405;\ncf. Robson 2001). Thus, it is likely that Pythagoras and other Greeks\nfirst encountered the truth of the theorem as a Babylonian\narithmetical technique (H\u00f8yrup 1999, 402; Burkert 1972a,429). It is\npossible, then, that Pythagoras just passed on to the Greeks a truth\nthat he learned from the East. The emphasis in the two lines of verse\nis not just on Pythagoras\u2019 discovery of the truth of the theorem, it\nis as much or more on his sacrifice of oxen in honor of the\ndiscovery. We are probably supposed to imagine that the sacrifice was\nnot of a single ox; Apollodorus describes it as \u201ca famous\nsacrifice of oxen\u201d and Diogenes Laertius paraphrases this as a\nhecatomb, which need not be, as it literally says, a hundred\noxen, but still suggests a large number. Some have wanted to doubt the\nwhole story, including the discovery of the theorem, because it\nconflicts with Pythagoras\u2019 supposed vegetarianism, but it is far from\nclear to what extent he was a vegetarian (see above). If the story is\nto have any force and if it dates to the fourth century, it shows that\nPythagoras was famous for a connection to a certain piece of\ngeometrical knowledge, but it also shows that he was famous for his\nenthusiastic response to that knowledge, as evidenced in his sacrifice\nof oxen, not for any geometric proof. What emerges from this evidence,\nthen, is not Pythagoras as the master geometer, who provides rigorous\nproofs, but rather Pythagoras as someone who recognizes and celebrates\ncertain geometrical relationships as of high importance.\n\n\nIt is striking that a very similar picture of Pythagoras emerges from\nthe evidence for his cosmology. A famous discovery is attributed to\nPythagoras in the later tradition, i.e., that the central musical\nconcords (the octave, fifth and fourth) correspond to the whole number\nratios 2 : 1, 3 : 2 and 4 : 3 respectively (e.g., Nicomachus,\nHandbook 6 = Iamblichus, On the Pythagorean Life\n115). The only early source to associate Pythagoras with the whole\nnumber ratios that govern the concords is Xenocrates (Fr. 9) in the\nearly Academy, but the early Academy is precisely one source of the\nlater exaggerated tradition about Pythagoras (see above). One story\nhas it that Pythagoras passed by a blacksmith\u2019s shop and heard the\nconcords in the sounds of the hammers striking the anvil and then\ndiscovered that the sounds made by hammers whose weights are in the\nratio 2 : 1 will be an octave apart, etc. Unfortunately, the stories\nof Pythagoras\u2019 discovery of these relationships are clearly false,\nsince none of the techniques for the discovery ascribed to him would,\nin fact, work (e.g., the pitch of sounds produced by hammers is not\ndirectly proportional to their weight: see Burkert 1972a, 375). An\nexperiment ascribed to Hippasus, who was active in the first half of\nthe fifth century, after Pythagoras\u2019 death, would have worked, and\nthus we can trace the scientific verification of the discovery at\nleast to Hippasus; knowledge of the relation between whole number\nratios and the concords is clearly found in the fragments of Philolaus\n(Fr. 6a, Huffman), in the second half of the fifth century. There is\nsome evidence that the truth of the relationship was already known to\nPythagoras\u2019 contemporary, Lasus, who was not a Pythagorean (Burkert\n1972a, 377). It may be once again that Pythagoras knew of the\nrelationship without either having discovered it or having\ndemonstrated it scientifically.  The relationship was probably first\ndiscovered by instrument makers, and specifically makers of wind\ninstruments rather than stringed instruments (Barker 2014,\n202). The acusmata reported by Aristotle, which may go back\nto Pythagoras, report the following question and answer \u201cWhat is\nthe oracle at Delphi? The tetraktys, which is the harmony in\nwhich the Sirens sing\u201d (Iamblichus, On the Pythagorean\nLife, 82, probably derived from Aristotle). The\ntetraktys, literally \u201cthe four,\u201d refers to the\nfirst four numbers, which when added together equal the number ten,\nwhich was regarded as the perfect number in fifth-century\nPythagoreanism. Here in the acusmata, these four numbers are\nidentified with one of the primary sources of wisdom in the Greek\nworld, the Delphic oracle.  In the later tradition the\ntetraktys is treated as the summary of all Pythagorean\nwisdom, since the Pythagoreans swore oaths by Pythagoras as \u201cthe\none who handed down the tetraktys to our generation.\u201d\nThe tetraktys can be connected to the music which the Sirens\nsing in that all of the ratios that correspond to the basic concords\nin music (octave, fifth and fourth) can be expressed as whole number\nratios of the first four numbers. This acusma thus seems to\nbe based on the knowledge of the relationship between the concords and\nthe whole number ratios. The picture of Pythagoras that emerges from\nthe evidence is thus not of a mathematician, who offered rigorous\nproofs, or of a scientist, who carried out experiments to discover the\nnature of the natural world, but rather of someone who sees special\nsignificance in and assigns special prominence to mathematical\nrelationships that were in general circulation. This is the context in\nwhich to understand Aristoxenus\u2019 remark that \u201cPythagoras most of\nall seems to have honored and advanced the study concerned with\nnumbers, having taken it away from the use of merchants and likening\nall things to numbers\u201d (Fr. 23, Wehrli). Some might suppose that\nthis is a reference to a rigorous treatment of arithmetic, such as\nthat hypothesized by Becker (1936), who argued that Euclid\nIX. 21\u201334 was a self-contained unit that represented a deductive\ntheory of odd and even numbers developed by the Pythagoreans (see\nMueller 1997, 296 ff. and Burkert 1972a, 434 ff.). It is crucial to\nrecognize, however, that Becker\u2019s reconstruction is rejected in some\nrecent scholarship (e.g., Netz 2014, 179) and no ancient source\nassigns it even to the Pythagoreans, let alone to Pythagoras\nhimself. There is, moreover, no talk of mathematical proof or a\ndeductive system in the passage from Aristoxenus just quoted.\nPythagoras is known for the honor he gives to number and for\nremoving it from the practical realm of trade and instead pointing to\ncorrespondences between the behavior of number and the behavior of\nthings. Such correspondences were highlighted in Aristotle\u2019s book on\nthe Pythagoreans, e.g., the female is likened to the number two and\nthe male to the number three and their sum, five, is likened to\nmarriage (Aristotle, Fr. 203).\n\n\nWhat then was the nature of Pythagoras\u2019 cosmos?  The doxographical\ntradition reports that Pythagoras discovered the sphericity of the\nearth, the five celestial zones and the identity of the evening and\nmorning star (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 48, Aetius III.14.1, Diogenes\nLaertius IX. 23). In each case, however, Burkert has shown that these\nreports seem to be false and the result of the glorification of\nPythagoras in the later tradition, since the earliest and most\nreliable evidence assigns these same discoveries to someone else\n(1972a, 303 ff.). Thus, Theophrastus, who is the primary basis of the\ndoxographical tradition, says that it was Parmenides who discovered\nthe sphericity of the earth (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 48). Parmenides\nis also identified as the discoverer of the identity of the morning\nand evening star (Diogenes Laertius IX. 23), and Pythagoras\u2019 claim\nappears to be based on a poem forged in his name, which was rejected\nalready by Callimachus in the third century BCE (Burkert 1972a, 307).\nThe identification of the five celestial zones depends on the\ndiscovery of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and some of the doxography\nduly assigns this discovery to Pythagoras as well and claims that\nOenopides stole it from Pythagoras (Aetius II.12.2); the history of\nastronomy by Aristotle\u2019s pupil Eudemus, our most reliable source,\nseems to attribute the discovery to Oenopides (there are problems with\nthe text), however (Eudemus, Fr. 145 Wehrli). It thus appears that the\nlater tradition, finding no evidence for Pythagoras\u2019 cosmology in the\nearly evidence, assigned the discoveries of Parmenides back to\nPythagoras, encouraged by traditions which made Parmenides the pupil\nof Pythagoras. In the end, there is no evidence for Pythagoras\u2019\ncosmology in the early evidence, beyond what can be reconstructed\nfrom acusmata. As was shown above, Pythagoras saw the cosmos\nas structured according to number insofar as the tetraktys is\nthe source of all wisdom. His cosmos was also imbued with a moral\nsignificance, which is in accordance with his beliefs about\nreincarnation and the fate of the soul (West 1971, 215\u2013216; Huffman\n2013, 60\u201368). Thus, in answer to the question \u201cWhat are the\nIsles of the Blest?\u201d (where we might hope to go, if we lived a\ngood life), the answer is \u201cthe sun and the moon.\u201d Again\n\u201cthe planets are the hounds of Persephone,\u201d i.e., the\nplanets are agents of vengeance for wrong done (Aristotle in\nPorphyry VP 41). Aristotle similarly reports that for the\nPythagoreans thunder \u201cis a threat to those in Tartarus, so that\nthey will be afraid\u201d (Posterior Analytics 94b) and\nanother acusma says that \u201can earthquake is nothing\nother than a meeting of the dead\u201d (Aelian, Historical\nMiscellany, IV. 17). Zhmud calls these\ncosmological acusmata into question (2012a, 329\u2013330), noting\nthat some only appear in Porphyry, but Porphyry explicitly identifies\nAristotle as his source and we have no reason to doubt him\n(VP 41). Pythagoras\u2019 cosmos embodied mathematical\nrelationships that had a basis in fact and combined them with moral\nideas tied to the fate of the soul. The best analogy for the type of\naccount of the cosmos which Pythagoras gave might be some of the myths\nwhich appear at the end of Platonic dialogues such as\nthe Phaedo,\nGorgias or Republic, where cosmology has a primarily\nmoral purpose.  Should the doctrine of the harmony of the spheres be\nassigned to Pythagoras? Certainly the acusma which talks of\nthe sirens singing in the harmony represented by the\ntetraktys suggests that there might have been a cosmic music\nand that Pythagoras may well have thought that the heavenly bodies,\nwhich we see move across the sky at night, made music by their\nmotions. On the other hand, there is no evidence for \u201cthe\nspheres,\u201d if we mean by that a cosmic model according to which\neach of the heavenly bodies is associated with a series of concentric\ncircular orbits, a model which is at least in part designed to explain\ncelestical phenomena. The first such cosmic model in the Pythagorean\ntradition is that of Philolaus in the second half of the fifth\ncentury, a model which still shows traces of the connection to the\nmoral cosmos of Pythagoras in its account of the counter-earth and the\ncentral fire (see Philolaus).\n\n\nIf Pythagoras was primarily a figure of religious and ethical\nsignificance, who left behind an influential way of life and for whom\nnumber and cosmology primarily had significance in this religious and\nmoral context, how are we to explain the prominence of rigorous\nmathematics and mathematical cosmology in later Pythagoreans such as\nPhilolaus and Archytas? It is important to note that this is not just\na question asked by modern scholars but was already a central question\nin the fourth century BCE. What is the connection between Pythagoras\nand fifth-century Pythagoreans? The question is implicit in\nAristotle\u2019s description of the fifth-century Pythagoreans such as\nPhilolaus as \u201cthe so-called Pythagoreans.\u201d This expression\nis most easily understood as expressing Aristotle\u2019s recognition that\nthese people were called Pythagoreans and at the same time his\npuzzlement as to what connection there could be between the\nwonder-worker who promulgated the acusmata, which his\nresearches show Pythagoras to have been, and the philosophy of\nlimiters and unlimiteds put forth in fifth-century Pythagoreanism. The\ntradition of a split between two groups of Pythagoreans in the fifth\ncentury, the mathematici and the acusmatici, points\nto the same puzzlement. The evidence for this split is quite confused\nin the later tradition, but Burkert (1972a, 192 ff.) has shown that\nthe original and most objective account of the split is found in a\npassage of Aristotle\u2019s book on the Pythagoreans, which is preserved in\nIamblichus (On Common Mathematical Science, 76.19 ff). The\nacusmatici, who are clearly connected by their name to the\nacusmata, are recognized by the other group, the\nmathematici, as genuine Pythagoreans, but the\nacusmatici do not regard the philosophy of the\nmathematici as deriving from Pythagoras but rather from\nHippasus. The mathematici appear to have argued that, while\nthe acusmatici were indeed Pythagoreans, it was the\nmathematici who were the true Pythagoreans; Pythagoras gave\nthe acusmata to those who did not have the time to study the\nmathematical sciences, so that they would at least have moral\nguidance, while to those who had the time to fully devote themselves\nto Pythagoreanism he gave training in the mathematical sciences, which\nexplained the reasons for this guidance. This tradition thus shows\nthat all agreed that the acusmata represented the teaching of\nPythagoras, but that some regarded the mathematical work associated\nwith the mathematici as not deriving from Pythagoras himself,\nbut rather from Hippasus (on the controversy about the evidence for\nthis split into two groups of Pythagoreans see the fifth paragraph of\nsection 4.3 above). For fourth-century Greeks as for modern scholars,\nthe question is whether the mathematical and scientific side of later\nPythagoreanism derived from Pythagoras or not. If there were no\nintelligible way to understand how later Pythagoreanism could have\narisen out of the Pythagoreanism of the acusmata, the puzzle\nof Pythagoras\u2019 relation to the later tradition would be insoluble. The\ncosmos of the acusmata, however, clearly shows a belief in a\nworld structured according to mathematics, and some of the evidence\nfor this belief may have been drawn from genuine mathematical truths\nsuch as those embodied in the \u201cPythagorean\u201d theorem and\nthe relation of whole number ratios to musical concords. Even if\nPythagoras\u2019 cosmos was of primarily moral and symbolic significance,\nthese strands of mathematical truth, which were woven into it, would\nprovide the seeds from which later Pythagoreanism grew. Philolaus\u2019\ncosmos and his metaphysical system, in which all things arise from\nlimiters and unlimiteds and are known through numbers, are not stolen\nfrom Pythagoras. They embody a conception of mathematics, which owes\nmuch to the more rigorous mathematics of Hippocrates of Chios in the\nmiddle of the fifth century; the contrast between limiter and\nunlimited makes most sense after Parmenides\u2019 emphasis on the role of\nlimit in the first part of the fifth century. Philolaus\u2019 system is\nnonetheless an intelligible development of the reverence for\nmathematical truth found in Pythagoras\u2019 own cosmological scheme, which\nis embodied in the acusmata.\n\n\nThe picture of Pythagoras presented above is inevitably based on\ncrucial decisions about sources and has been recently challenged in a\nsearching critique (Zhmud 2012a). Zhmud argues that the consensus view\nof Pythagoras\u2019 cosmos as presented above is based on the faulty\nassumption that there was a progression from myth and religion to\nreason and science in Pythagoreanism. In many cases, he argues, the\nevidence suggests that early Pythagoreanism was more scientific and\nthat religious and mythic elements only gained in importance in the\nlater tradition. The consensus picture of Pythagoras\u2019 cosmos assigns\nnumber symbolism a central role and treats the tetraktys, the\nfirst four numbers, which total to the perfect number ten, as a\ncentral concept. Zhmud argues that the tetraktys and the\nimportance of the number ten do not go back to Pythagoras but flourish\nin the Neopythagorean tradition, while having roots in number\nspeculation in the Academy associated with such figures as Plato\u2019s\nsuccessor Speusippus. One of the central pieces of evidence for this\nview is that the tetraktys does not first appear until late\nin the tradition, in Aetius in the first century CE (DK\n1.3.8). However, the tetraktys does appear in one of\nthe acusmata in a section (82) of Iamblichus\u2019 On the\nPythagorean Life that is commonly regarded as deriving from\nAristotle. Zhmud himself agrees that sections 82\u201386 of On the\nPythagorean Life as a whole go back to Aristotle but suggests\nthat the acusma about the tetraktys was a post-Aristotelian\naddition (2012a, 300\u2013303). Once again source criticism is crucial. If\nthe acusma in question goes back to Aristotle then there is\ngood evidence for the tetraktys in early Pythagoreanism. If\nwe regard it as a later insertion into Aristotelian material, the\nearly Pythagorean credentials of the tetraktys are less\nclear.  \n\n\nZhmud supports Pythagoras\u2019 position as genuine mathematician rather\nthan someone interested only in number symbolism by pointing to gaps\nin the development of early Greek mathematics. Although there is no\nexplicit evidence, Pythagoras is the most likely candidate to fill\nthese gaps. Thus between Thales, whom Eudemus identifies as the first\ngeometer, and Hippocrates of Chios, who produced the\nfirst Elements, someone turned geometry into a deductive\nscience (Zhmud 2012a, 256). Similarly, Hippasus\u2019 experiment with\nbronze disks to show that the concordant intervals of the octave,\nfifth and fourth were governed by whole number ratios is too complex\nto be a first attempt so that once again someone must have discovered\nthe ratios in a simpler way earlier (Zhmud 2012a, 291). In each case\nZhmud suggests that Pythagoras is that someone. Finally, the study of\nproportion ties together airthmetic, geometry and harmonics and Zhmud\nargues that, although there is no explicit fourth-century evidence,\nlater reports which assign Pythagoras the discovery of the first three\nproportions (Iamblichus, Commentary on Nicomachus\u2019 Introduction to\nArithmetic 100.19\u2013101.11) are likely to go back to Eudemus\n(2012a, 265\u2013266). Such speculations have some plausibility but they\nhighlight even more the puzzle as to why, if Pythagoras played this\ncentral role in early Greek mathematics, no early source explicitly\nascribes it to him. Of course, some scholars argue that the majority\nhave overlooked key passages that do assign mathematical achievements\nto Pythagoras. In order to gain a rounded view of the Pythagorean\nquestion it is thus appropriate to look at the most controversial of\nthese passages.\n\n\nSome scholars who regard Pythagoras as a mathematician and rational\ncosmologist, such as Guthrie, admit that the earliest evidence does\nnot support this view (Lloyd 2014, 25), but maintain that the\nprominence of Pythagoras the mathematician in the late tradition must\nbe based on something early. Others maintain that there is evidence in\nthe sixth- and fifth-century BCE for Pythagoras as a mathematician and\ncosmologist. They argue that Herodotus\u2019 reference to Pythagoras as a\nwise man (sophist\u00eas) and Heraclitus\u2019 description of him\nas pursuing inquiry (histori\u00ea), show that he was\nregarded as practicing rational cosmology (Kahn 2002, 16\u201317;\nZhmud 2012a, 33\u201343). The concept of a wise man in Herodotus\u2019\ntime was very broad, however, and includes poets and sages as well as\nIonian cosmologists; the same is true of the concept of\ninquiry. Histori\u00ea peri physeos (inquiry concerning\nnature) is later used to refer specifically to the inquiry into nature\npracticed by the Presocratic cosmologists, but Herodotus\u2019 usage shows\nthat at Heraclitus\u2019 time histori\u00ea referred to inquiry\nin a quite general sense and has no specific reference to the\ncosmological inquiry of the Presocratics (Huffman 2008b). In one\ninstance in Herodotus it refers to inquiry into the stories of\nMenelaus\u2019 and Helen\u2019s adventures in Egypt (II. 118). Heraclitus may be\nthinking of Pythagoras\u2019 inquiry into and collection of the mythical\nand religious lore that is found in the acusmata (Huffman\n2008b; see also Gemelli Marciano 2002, 96\u2013103). Thus the\ndescription of Pythagoras as a wise man who practiced inquiry is\nsimply too general to aid in deciding what sort of figure Herodotus\nand Heraclitus saw him as being. It is certainly true that Empedocles\nshows that the roles of rational cosmologist and wonder-working\nreligious teacher could be combined in one figure, but this\ndoes not prove these roles were combined in Pythagoras\u2019 case. The only\nthing that could prove this in Pythagoras\u2019 case is reliable early\nevidence for a rational cosmology and that is precisely what is\nlacking.\n\n\nThere is more controversy about the fourth-century evidence. Zhmud\nargues that Isocrates regards Pythagoras as a philosopher and\nmathematician (2012a, 50). However, it is hard to see how the passage\nin question (Busiris 28\u201329) supports this view. Nowhere in it\ndoes Isocrates ascribe mathematical work or a rational cosmology to\nPythagoras. He reports in general terms that Pythagoras brought\n\u201c other philosophy\u201d to Greece from Egypt but what he\nemphasizes is that Pythagoras was \u201cmore clearly interested than\nothers in sacrificial rites and temple rituals.\u201d It is true that\nearlier, in a passage that does not mention Pythagoras\n(Busiris 22\u201323), Isocrates had said that some of the Egyptian\npriests studied mathematics but if Isocrates thought Pythagoras also\nbrought mathematical learning from Egypt he has chosen not to say so\nexplicitly. What Isocrates emphasizes about Pythagoras is what the\nrest of the early tradition emphasizes, his interest in religious\nrites. Fr. 191 from Aristotle\u2019s lost work on the Pythagoreans reports\nthat Pythagoras \u201cdedicated himself to the study of mathematical\nsciences, especially numbers\u201d and Fragment 20 from\nAristotle\u2019s Proptrepticus says that Pythagoras said that\nhuman beings were born to contemplate the heavens and described\nhimself as an observor of nature (Zhmud 2012a, 56 and\n259\u2013260). Unfortunately, in neither case are the words in question\nlikely to be Aristotle\u2019s. Fr. 191 comes from a book on marvels by\nApollonius (2nd BCE?). The words in question come before Apollonius\nmentions Aristotle and, as Burkert pointed out (1972a, 412), are\noverwhelming likely to be by Apollonius himself, since they serve as\nthe transition sentence between Apollonius\u2019 account of Pherecydes and\nhis account of Pythagoras. In the face of the huge extant corpus of\nAristotle\u2019s works in which he never ascribes any mathematical work to\nPythagoras, a single sentence that is not ascribed directly to\nAristotle and that, in terms of function, appears to be the work of\nApollonius and not Aristotle cannot with any confidence be used as\nevidence that Aristotle regarded Pythagoras as a mathematician. The\nsame situation arises with Fr. 20 of the Protrepticus. If the\nwords in question were by Aristotle they would be his sole statement\nthat Pythagoras was a natural philosopher. The case of Fr. 20 is even\nmore tenuous than that of Fr. 191. Fr. 20 comes from\nIamblichus\u2019 Protrepticus, large parts of which are likely to\nderive from Aristotle\u2019s lost Protrepticus but, as is his\npractice, Iamblichus does not make any explicit reference to\nAristotle. The further problem with Fr. 20, as Burkert noted (1960,\n166\u2013168), is that the same story is told first about Pythagoras and\nthen immediately afterwards about Anaxagoras: both are asked why human\nbeings were born and both answer \u201cto contemplate the\nheavens\u201d (Iamblichus, Protrepticus 51.8\u201315). This\nawkward repetition of the same story about two different people\nimmediately suggests that only one story was in the original and the\nother was added in the later tradition. This suggestion is strikingly\nconfirmed by the fact that Aristotle does tell this story about\nAnaxagoras in his extant works (Eudemian Ethics 1216a11\u201316)\nbut not about Pythagoras. Thus, if the passage in\nIamblichus\u2019 Protrepticus is, in fact, from Aristotle, it is\nvery likely that only Anaxagoras appeared in Aristotle\u2019s version and\nthat Pythagoras was added in the later tradition, perhaps by\nIamblichus himself. Since these two passages are unlikely to be from\nAristotle, there are no references to Pythagoras as a mathematician or\nas a natural philosopher either in Aristotle\u2019s extant works or in the\nfragments of his works. Aristotle only knows Pythagoras as a wonder\nworking sage and teacher of a way of life (Fr. 191). Aristotle\u2019s\nattitude is similar to his predecessors in the earlier fourth century:\nPlato\u2019s sole reference to Pythagoras is as the founder of a way of\nlife and Isocrates emphasizes both the way of life and the interest in\nreligious ritual.\n\n\nWhat about the pupils of Plato and Aristotle? As discussed in the\nsecond paragraph of section 5 above, Eudemus, who wrote a series of\nhistories of mathematics never mentions Pythagoras by name. Arguments\nfrom silence are perilous but, when the most well-informed source of\nthe fourth-century fails to mention Pythagoras in works explicitly\ndirected towards the history of mathematics, the silence means\nsomething. There are only two passages in which Pythagoras is\nexplicitly associated with anything mathematical or scientific by\npupils of Plato and Aristotle. First, Aristotle\u2019s pupil Aristoxenus\nreports that Pythagoras \u201cmost of all valued the pursuit\n(pragmateia) of number and brought it forward, taking it away\nfrom the use of traders, by likening all things to numbers\u201d\n(Fr. 23). Zhmud translates  pragmateia as\n\u201cscience\u201d (2012a, 216) so that he has Aristoxenus\nattributing the invention of the science of number to Pythagoras but,\nwhile Aristoxenus does use pragmateia to mean science in some\ncontexts, it more commonly simply means \u201cpursuit\u201d (Huffman\n2014b, 292). Here surely it must mean \u201cpursuit,\u201d because\nPythagoras is presented as taking it away from the traders and we can\nhardly suppose that the traders were engaged in the theoretical\nscience of arithmetic. Moreover, Aristoxenus explains what he means in\nthe final participial phrase. He is not ascribing rigorous mathematics\nwith proofs to Pythagoras but rather says that Pythagoras was\n\u201clikening all things to numbers\u201d. This is consistent with\nthe moralized cosmos of Pythagoras sketched above in which numbers\nhave symbolic significance. The second important passage is Plato\u2019s\npupil Xenocrates\u2019 assertion that Pythagoras \u201cdiscovered that the\nintervals in music, too, do not arise in separation from number\u201d\n(Fr. 9). Xenocrates is being quoted here in a fragment of a work by a\nHeraclides (Barker 1989, 235\u2013236), perhaps Heraclides of Pontus. There\nis controversy whether the quotation of Xenocrates is limited just to\nwhat has been quoted in the previous sentence or whether the whole\nfragment of Heraclides is a quotation of Xenocrates. Burkert (1972a,\n381) and Barker (1989, 235) argue that it is probably just the first\nsentence that Heraclides ascribes to Xenocrates, while Zhmud would\ninclude at least a second sentence in which Heraclides presents\nPythagoras as pursuing a program of research into \u201cthe\nconditions under which concordant and discordant intervals\narise\u201d (Zhmud 2012a, 258). If the second sentence is accepted\nthen Xenocrates clearly presents Pythagoras as an acoustic\nscientist. It seems most reasonable, however, to accept only the first\nsentence as belonging to Xenocrates. If the quotation from Xenocrates\ndoes not break off at that point, there is no other obvious breaking\npoint in the fragment and the whole two pages of text must be ascribed\nto Xenocrates. The problem with ascribing it all to Xenocrates is that\nPorphyry introduces the passage as a quotation from Heraclides, which\nwould be strange if everything quoted, in fact, belongs to\nXenocrates. If just the first sentence comes from Xenocrates, then all\nhe is ascribing to Pythagoras is the recognition that the concordant\nintervals are connected to numbers. It is easy to assume, as Zhmud\ndoes, that Xenocrates is saying that Pythagoras was the first\nto discover that the concordant intervals are governed by whole number\nratios but Xenocrates\u2019 remarks need not mean this. Xenocrates\u2019\ncomments might well come from a context like that in the fragment of\nAristoxenus, above, i.e., a context in which Pythagoras is presented\nas likening all things to numbers and arguing that numbers in some\nsense explain or control things. In such a context Xenocrates would\nnot be making the point that Pythagoras discovered the whole number\nratios but rather that he found out that concords arose in accordance\nwith whole number ratios, perhaps from musicians (who discovered them\nfirst not being the issue), and used this fact as another illustration\nof how things are like numbers. Thus, the fragments of Aristoxenus and\nXeoncrates show that Pythagoras likened things to numbers and took the\nconcordant musical intervals as a central example, but do not suggest\nthat he founded arithmetic as a rigorous mathematical discipline or\ncarried out a program of scientific research in harmonics.\n\n\nControversy concerning Pythagoras\u2019 role as a scientist and\nmathematician will continue. Indeed, Hahn has recently endorsed many\nof Zhmud\u2019s arguments and argues that Pythagoras was a rational\ncosmologist, who was further developing a project begun by Thales to\ncontruct the cosmos out of right triangles. Hahn admits, however, that\nhis thesis is \u201cspeculative\u201d and \u201ca circumstantial\ncase at best\u201d (2017:xi). It should now be clear that decisions\nabout sources are crucial in addressing the question of whether\nPythagoras was a mathematician and scientist. The view of\nPythagoras\u2019 cosmos sketched in the first five paragraphs of this\nsection, according to which he was neither a mathematician nor a\nscientist, remains the consensus. \n",
