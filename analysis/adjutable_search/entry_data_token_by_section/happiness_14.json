This is fundamentally an empirical question, but\nthere are some in-principle issues that philosophical reflection might\ninform. One oft-heard claim, commonly called the \u201cparadox of\nhedonism,\u201d is that the pursuit of happiness is self-defeating;\nto be happy, don\u2019t pursue happiness. It is not clear how to\ninterpret this dictum, however, so that it is both interesting and\ntrue. It is plainly imprudent to make happiness one\u2019s focus at\nevery moment, but doubtful that this has often been denied. Yet never\nconsidering happiness also seems an improbable strategy for becoming\nhappier. If you are choosing among several equally worthwhile\noccupations, and have good evidence that some of them will make you\nmiserable, while one of them is likely to be highly fulfilling, it\nwould not seem imprudent to take that information into account. Yet to\ndo so just is to pursue happiness. The so-called paradox of hedonism\nis perhaps best seen as a vague caution against focusing too much on\nmaking oneself happy, not a blanket dismissal of the prospects for\nexpressly seeking happiness\u2014and for this modest point there is\ngood empirical evidence (Schooler, Ariely et al. 2003,\nLyubomirsky 2007).\n\nThat happiness is sometimes worth seeking does not mean we will always\ndo a good job of it (Haybron 2008b). In recent decades a massive body\nof empirical evidence has gathered on various ways in which people\nseem systematically prone to make mistakes in the pursuit of their\ninterests, including happiness. Such tendencies have been suggested in\nseveral domains relating to the pursuit of happiness, including (with\nrecent surveys cited):\n\nAssessing how happy we are, or were in the past (Haybron 2007)\nPredicting (\u201cforecasting\u201d) what will make us happy\n(Gilbert 2006)\nChoosing rationally (Kahneman and Tversky 2000, Gilovitch, Griffin\net al. 2002, Hsee and Hastie 2006)\n\n\nA related body of literature explores the costs and benefits of\n(ostensibly) making it easier to pursue happiness by increasing\npeople\u2019s options; it turns out that having more choices might\noften make people less happy, for instance by increasing the\nburdens of deliberation or the likelihood of regret (Schwartz 2004).\nLess discussed in this context, but highly relevant, is the large body\nof research indicating that human psychology and behavior are\nremarkably prone to unconscious social and other situational\ninfluences, most infamously reported in the Milgram obedience\nexperiments (Doris 2002, 2015, Haybron 2014). Human\nfunctioning, and the pursuit of happiness, may be more profoundly\nsocial than many commentators have \n assumed.[31] \n\nTaken together, this research bears heavily on two central questions\nin the philosophical literature: first, the broad character of human\nnature (e.g., in what sense are we rational animals? How should we\nconceive of human autonomy?); second, the philosophical ideals of the\ngood society and good government.\n",
