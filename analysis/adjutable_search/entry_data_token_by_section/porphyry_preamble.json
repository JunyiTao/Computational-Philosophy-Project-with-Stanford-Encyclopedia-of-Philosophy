    "main_text": "\n\nPorphyry (234?\u2013305? C.E.) was a Neoplatonist philosopher born in\nTyre in Phoenicia. He studied with Longinus in Athens and then with\nPlotinus in Rome from 263\u2013269 C.E. and became a follower of the\nlatter\u2019s version of Platonism. Porphyry wrote in just about\nevery branch of learning practiced at the time but only a portion of\nhis large output is extant. Porphyry was an influential thinker. He\napplied Neoplatonism to pagan religion and other spheres and is, as\nsuch, a key figure in the promulgation of Neoplatonic thought. His\nwritings on Aristotle\u2019s logical works, preserved in part and\ninfluential in the Latin West through Boethius\u2019 translations,\ncontain attempts to harmonize Aristotle\u2019s logical writings with\nPlatonism. Such reconciliatory attitude towards Aristotle\ncharacterizes much of his philosophy.\n",
