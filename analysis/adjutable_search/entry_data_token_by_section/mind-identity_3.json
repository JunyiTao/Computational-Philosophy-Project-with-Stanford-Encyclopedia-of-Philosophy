Lewis's 1966 was a particularly clear headed\npresentation of the identity theory in which he says (I here refer to\nthe reprint in Lewis 1983, p. 100): \nMy argument is this: The definitive characteristic of any\n(sort of) experience as such is its causal role, its syndrome of most\ntypical causes and effects. But we materialists believe that these\ncausal roles which belong by analytic necessity to experiences belong\nin fact to certain physical states. Since these physical states possess\nthe definitive character of experiences, they must be\nexperiences.\n\n\nSimilarly, Robert Kirk (1999) has argued for the impossibility of\nzombies. If the supposed zombie has all the behavioural and neural\nproperties ascribed to it by those who argue from the possibility of\nzombies against materialism, then the zombie is conscious and so not a\nzombie.\n\n\nThus there is no need for explicit use of Ockham's Razor as in Smart\n(1959) though not in Place (1956). (See Place 1960.) Lewis's paper was\nextremely valuable and already there are hints of a marriage between\nthe identity theory of mind and so-called \u2018functionalist\u2019\nideas that are explicit in Lewis 1972 and 1994. In his 1972\n(\u2018Psychophysical and Theoretical Identifications\u2019) he\napplies ideas in his more formal paper \u2018How to Define Theoretical\nTerms\u2019 (1970). Folk psychology contains words such as\n\u2018sensation\u2019, \u2018perceive\u2019, \u2018belief,\n\u2018desire\u2019, \u2018emotion\u2019, etc. which we recognise as\npsychological. Words for colours, smells, sounds, tastes and so on also\noccur. One can regard common sense platitudes containing both these\nsorts of these words as constituting a theory and we can take them as\ntheoretical terms of common sense psychology and thus as denoting\nwhatever entities or sorts of entities uniquely realise the theory.\nThen if certain neural states do so too (as we believe) then the mental\nstates must be these neural states. In his 1994 he allows for tact in\nextracting a consistent theory from common sense. One cannot\nuncritically collect platitudes, just as in producing a grammar,\nimplicit in our speech patterns, one must allow for departures from\nwhat on our best theory would constitute grammaticality.\n\n\nA great advantage of this approach over the early identity theory is\nits holism. Two features of this holism should be noted. One is that\nthe approach is able to allow for the causal interactions between brain\nstates and processes themselves, as well as in the case of external\nstimuli and responses. Another is the ability to draw on the notion of\nRamseyfication of a theory. F.P. Ramsey had shown how to replace the\ntheoretical terms of a theory such as \u2018the property of being an\nelectron\u2019 by \u2018the property X such that...\u2019. so that\nwhen this is done for all the theoretical terms, we are left only with\n\u2018property X such that\u2019, \u2018property Y such that\u2019\netc. Take the terms describing behaviour as the observation terms and\npsychological terms as the theoretical ones of folk psychology. Then\nRamseyfication shows that folk psychology is compatible with\nmaterialism. This seems right, though perhaps the earlier identity\ntheory deals more directly with reports of immediate experience.\n\n\nThe causal approach was also characteristic of D.M. Armstrong's\ncareful conceptual analysis of mental states and processes, such as\nperception and the secondary qualities, sensation, consciousness,\nbelief, desire, emotion, voluntary action, in his A Materialist\nTheory of the Mind (1968a) with a second edition (1993) containing\na valuable new preface. Parts I and II of this book are concerned with\nconceptual analysis, paving the way for a contingent identification of\nmental states and processes with material ones. As had Brian Medlin, in\nan impressive critique of Ryle and defence of materialism (Medlin\n1967), Armstrong preferred to describe the identity theory as\n\u2018Central State Materialism\u2019. Independently of Armstrong and\nLewis, Medlin's central state materialism depended, as theirs did, on a\ncausal analysis of concepts of mental states and processes. See Medlin\n1967, and 1969 (including endnote 1).\n\n\nMention should particularly be made here of two of Armstrong's other\nbooks, one on perception (1961), and one on bodily sensations, (1962).\nArmstrong thought of perception as coming to believe by means of\nthe senses (compare also Pitcher 1971). This combines the\nadvantages of Direct Realism with hospitality towards the scientific\ncausal story which had been thought to have supported the earlier\nrepresentative theory of perception. Armstrong regarded bodily\nsensations as perceptions of states of our body. Of course the latter\nmay be mixed up with emotional states, as an itch may include a\npropensity to scratch, and contrariwise in exceptional circumstances\npain may be felt without distress. However, Armstrong sees the central\nnotion here as that of perception. This suggests a terminological\nproblem. Smart had talked of visual sensations. These were not\nperceptions but something which occurred in perception. So in\nthis sense of \u2018sensation\u2019 there should be bodily\nsensation sensations. The ambiguity could perhaps be resolved by using\nthe word \u2018sensing\u2019 in the context of \u2018visual\u2019,\n\u2018auditory\u2019, \u2018tactile\u2019 and \u2018bodily\u2019,\nso that bodily sensations would be perceivings which involved\nintrospectible \u2018sensings\u2019. These bodily sensations are\nperceptions and there can be misperceptions as when a person with his\nfoot amputated can think that he has a pain in the foot. He has a\nsensing \u2018having a pain in the foot\u2019 but the world does not\ncontain a pain in the foot, just as it does not contain sense data or\nimages but does contain havings of sense data and of images.\n\n\nArmstrong's central state materialism involved identifying beliefs\nand desires with states of the brain (1968a). Smart came to agree with\nthis. On the other hand Place resisted the proposal to extend the\nidentity theory to dispositional states such as beliefs and desires. He\nstressed that we do not have privileged access to our beliefs and\ndesires. Like Ryle he thought of beliefs and desires as to be\nelucidated by means of hypothetical statements about behaviour and gave\nthe analogy of the horsepower of a car (Place 1967). However he held\nthat the dispute here is not so much about the neural basis of mental\nstates as about the nature of dispositions. His views on dispositions\nare argued at length in his debate with Armstrong and Martin\n(Armstrong, Martin and Place, T. Crane (ed.) 1996). Perhaps we can be\nrelaxed about whether mental states such as beliefs and desires are\ndispositions or are topic neutrally described neurophysiological states\nand return to what seems to be the more difficult issue of\nconsciousness. Causal identity theories are closely related to\nFunctionalism, to be discussed in the next section. Smart had been wary\nof the notion of causality in metaphysics believing that it had no\nplace in theoretical physics. However even so he should have admitted\nit in folk psychology and also in scientific psychology and biology\ngenerally, in which physics and chemistry are applied to explain\ngeneralisations rather than strict laws. If folk psychology uses the\nnotion of causality, it is no matter if it is what Quine has called\nsecond grade discourse, involving the very contextual notions of\nmodality.\n",
