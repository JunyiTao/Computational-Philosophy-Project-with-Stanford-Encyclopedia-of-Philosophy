    "main_text": "The challenge of globalisation || Citizenship and borders\n3.1 Citizenship and borders\n\nDoes the state have the moral right to decide who can become a citizen\nor is there a fundamental right to free movement? The philosophical\ndebate has largely focused on two issues: first, on the nature of\nobligations that wealthy states have towards people from impoverished\ncountries who seek better lives for themselves and their families;\nsecondly, on the moral status of political communities and their\nsupposed right to protect their integrity by excluding\nnon-members.\n\nOne way of characterizing one\u2019s obligations towards strangers is\nto insist that, absent any relations of cooperation, common humanity\nis our only bond. Only a weak, imperfect or conditional duty of\nassistance, it is argued, can be inferred from this premise. This duty\nlimits the basic right of a political community to distribute\nmembership as it wishes without, in any way, displacing it.\nIndividuals have a duty to assist strangers in urgent need if they can\nhelp without exposing themselves to significant risk or cost. At a\ncollective level, the implications are more considerable as political\ncommunities have greater resources and can consider a broader range of\nbenevolent actions at comparably negligible cost. The principle of\nmutual aid may justify redistribution of membership, territory, wealth\nand resources to the extent that certain states have more than they\ncan reasonably be said to need (Walzer 1983, 47). However, in this\nframework redistributive policies remain entirely dependent on\nwealthier countries\u2019 understanding of their needs and of the\nurgency of a stranger\u2019s situation. There is no obligation to\ngive equal weight to the interests of non-members.\n\nInstitutionally, this position supports what the Geneva Convention on\nthe Status of Refugees (United Nations 1951) calls the principle of\n\u201cnon refoulement\u201d: signatory states are not to\ndeport refugees and asylum seekers to their countries of origin if\nthis threatens their lives and freedom. It can also support claims in\nfavour of increasing the number of immigrants admitted into richer\ncountries, depending on how the latter evaluate the potential effects\non their own interests.\n\nCritics contend that obligations towards migrants and asylum-seekers\ngo well beyond this and call for a policy of open borders and/or deny\nthe state\u2019s right to decide alone who exactly, and how many\npeople, may enter its territory. Three basic strategies are employed:\nthe first consists of arguing that freedom of movement is a\nfundamental human right. For example, some have argued that any theory\nrecognizing the equal moral value of individuals and giving them moral\nprimacy over communities cannot justify rejecting aliens\u2019 claims\nto admission and citizenship. As Carens demonstrated in an early\narticle, this argument applies to the three main strands of\ncontemporary liberal theory: libertarianism (\u00e0 la\nNozick), Rawlsianism and utilitarianism (Carens 1987). If the\nprinciple of moral equality is given its full extension, the\ndistinction between citizen and alien appears as morally arbitrary,\njustified neither by nature nor achievement. When evaluating border\nand immigration policies, the equal consideration of the interests of\nall affected (be they aliens or citizens) is required. Political\ncommunities cannot decide whether they can afford to accept refugee\nclaimants or prospective immigrants simply according to their\nunderstanding of their own situation, needs and interests.\nConsideration of consequences (e.g. in terms of public order, the\nsustainability of welfare policies, the potential effects of a brain\ndrain in developing countries, etc.) is not prohibited; what changes\nradically is how we are to evaluate them. Institutionally, this would\ndoubtless lead to substantial changes in the immigration and refugee\npolicies of most Western democracies.\n\nA second strategy advocated by Arash Abizadeh (2008) relies on the\nprinciple of democratic legitimacy, holding that the exercise of\ncoercive power is legitimate \u201conly insofar as it is actually\njustified by and to the very people over whom it is\nexercised\u201d (41). Since a regime of border control subjects both\ncitizens and non-citizens to the state\u2019s coercive use of power,\n\u201cthe justification for a particular regime of border control is\nowed not just to those whom the boundary marks as members, but to\nnonmembers as well\u201d\n (45)[13].\n The argument\u2019s upshot is that no democratic state has the right\nto unilaterally control its own borders, but must either allow freedom\nof movement or, at the very least, give voice to prospective\nimmigrants when formulating border policy. The latter condition would\nitself lead to significant changes in immigration policies in the\nWestern world, since jointly controlled borders would presumably be\nmore porous as well.\n\nThe third strategy is less direct. To the extent that states do not\nsatisfy their moral obligations to guarantee the universal human right\nto security and subsistence through international redistributive\npolicies, they have a moral obligation to admit those wishing to\nenter. Here the idea of open borders is an instrumental, rather than\nintrinsic, moral principle: it is a means towards achieving global\ndistributive justice (Bader 1997). The advantage of this line of\nargument is that it closely reflects a central motivation for open\nborders: the outrage provoked by the huge inequalities between North\nand South and rich countries\u2019 role in perpetuating this\nsituation. This strategy, if successful, would establish specific\nrights for people from poorer countries towards the North, rather than\na broadly framed right to free movement, to be \u2018equally\u2019\nenjoyed by individuals of rich and poor countries alike.\n\nTo be convincing the argument must show: first, that severe global\npoverty requires immediate action; second, that it is a matter of\njustice, not charity. To that effect, it is crucial to show that the\nextreme poverty of some countries is not simply the result of\nendogenous factors (e.g. bad governance; corrupt political culture,\netc.), but is linked to a global political and economic order that\nsystematically produces an unjust distribution of resources and\npolitical power, which rich northern countries, as its main\nbeneficiaries, are in no hurry to\n reform.[14]\n The third step in this argument purportedly shows that justifications\nof restrictive immigration policies premised on ethico-political\nclaims lose much of their force in the context of profound\ninternational inequalities and injustice. Proponents claim that\nregulating immigration to preserve the integrity of the political\ncommunity is a legitimate goal only if duties of international\ndistributive justice are satisfied (Tan 2004, 126, referring to Tamir\n1992, 161). The argument\u2019s upshot is that \u201c[r]ich Northern\nstates have a double moral obligation to seriously fight global\npoverty and to let more people in\u201d (Bader 1997, 31).\n\nMost supporters and critics of (more) open borders agree that liberal\ndemocratic states have a moral status and are worth\n preserving.[15]\n They disagree over what exactly is worthy of protection and how much\nweight should be given to securing their integrity (however it is\ndefined) relative to duties of international justice.\n\nThe division of the world into states is arguably justifiable on\nfunctional grounds, to the extent that states appear as \u201cfirst\napproximations of optimal units for allocating and producing the\nworld\u2019s resources\u201d (Coleman and Harding 1995, 38). If we\nthink that states matter simply as local units of efficient production\nand distribution, then this would be the main consideration when\nevaluating immigration policies. Public order arguments would still\nmatter, likewise claims pertaining to a society\u2019s basic capacity\nto secure its material reproduction, but not arguments relating to its\ncultural integrity or way of life. Unless, of course, the capacity of\nstates to act as efficient units of production and distribution is\nlinked to their being distinctive political communities with a\nparticular culture of shared meanings worth preserving.\n\nSome forty years ago, Michael Walzer defended this view, based on the\nidea that \u201cdistributive justice presupposes a bounded world\nwithin which distribution takes place\u201d (Walzer 1983, 31). Since\nthe goods to be divided, exchanged and shared among individuals have\nsocial meanings that are specific to particular communities, it is\nonly within their boundaries that conflict can be resolved and\ndistributive schemes judged either just or unjust. The crucial\nassumption here is that the \u201cpolitical community is probably the\nclosest we can come to a world of common meanings. Language, history,\nand culture come together [\u2026] to produce a collective\nconsciousness\u201d (Walzer 1983, 28). Politics itself, moreover, as\na set of practices and institutions that shape the form and outcome\nthat distributive conflicts take, \u201cestablishes its own bonds of\ncommonality\u201d (Walzer 1983, 29). To reject political\ncommunities\u2019 right to distribute the good of membership is to\nundermine their capacity to preserve their integrity as\n\u201ccommunities of character\u201d. It is to condemn them to\nbecome nothing more than neighbourhoods, random associations lacking\nany legally enforceable admissions policies. The probable result of\nthe free movement of individuals would be \u201ccasual\naggregates\u201d devoid of any internal cohesion and incapable of\nbeing a source of patriotic sentiments and solidarity. In a world of\nneighbourhoods, membership would become meaningless. The upshot is\nthat the political community\u2019s right to regulate admission\nshould be recognized to secure its cultural, economic and political\nintegrity.\n\nWalzer\u2019s position, notably his choice of analogies, has been\nextensively\n discussed.[16]\n His assumption that sovereign states constitute communities of shared\nmeanings appears particularly shaky. Most often, existing states\nincorporate various political communities that are themselves\ninternally pluralistic: linguistically, culturally and ideologically.\nOne would be hard pressed to identify the community whose integrity is\nat stake. Indeed, few states correspond to the picture Walzer\nenvisages as the appropriate context for distributive justice.\n\nBecause it is premised on a thinner conception of the political\ncommunity, liberal nationalists may be able to offer a similar account\nof the state\u2019s right to control its borders that may be less\nvulnerable to this kind of criticism. David Miller, for instance,\nargues that liberal democratic states \u201crequire a common public\nculture that in part constitutes the political identity of their\nmembers, and that serves valuable functions in supporting democracy\nand other social goals\u201d (Miller 2014, 369). A society\u2019s\npublic culture provides its citizens, their diverse identities and\nways of life notwithstanding (i.e. what Miller calls their private\nculture), with shared reference points (e.g. an overlapping set of\nbeliefs about the kind of political system they want to live in,\nsocial norms about how to behave in the public space, etc.) that\nenable them to confront their society\u2019s challenges. The public\nculture also acts as a bridge between the society\u2019s past, its\npresent, and its future. It plays a key role in securing the kind of\ntrust between citizens and towards political institutions that is\nessential for the provision of public goods and for supporting\npolicies involving economic redistribution. \u201cWhere trust is\nlacking\u201d, writes Miller, \u201cdeliberation is likely to be\nreplaced by self-interested bargaining on the part of each group,\nwhere the outcome reflects the balance of power between them\u201d\n(Miller 2016, 64). Citizens of liberal democratic states have a\nlegitimate interest in preserving their public culture. This includes\nthe capacity to decide the scale and type of immigration allowed in\nthe country in order to regulate the changes that the common public\nculture may experience because of new arrivals. According to Miller,\nthe concern here is not about diversity, but \u201cabout areas in\nwhich private culture and public culture intersect \u2013 in which it\nbecomes harder to reach agreement on public matters because people\napproach them on the basis of conflicting and privately held beliefs\nand values\u201d (Miller 2016, 68).\n\nMiller\u2019s argument has been widely discussed over the years\n(Carens 2013; Stilz 2022; Wellman 2008, 2022). His account of the\ncommon public culture has been described as unstable and unrealistic.\nAnna Stilz claims, for instance, that the internal diversity of\nliberal states is such \u201cthat it may be impossible to pick out\nany single \u2018common public culture\u2019, a[ny] set of\nunderstandings about how their collective life should be led\u201d\n(Stilz 2022, 13).\n\nSome theorists try to defend the state\u2019s right to\nself-determination \u2013 including the right to restrict immigration\n\u2013 without making any reference to the (common public) culture of\nthe political community. Chritopher Heath Wellman has argued that this\ncan be done by focusing on freedom of association as an integral part\nof self-determination (Wellman 2008, 2012; see also Ferracioli 2022).\nSince \u201cfreedom of association includes a right to reject a\npotential association and (often) a right to dissociate\u201d\n(Wellman 2008, 110), liberal democratic states \u2013 or legitimate\nstates \u2013 have a presumptive right to exclude immigrants:\n\u201cit does not matter how culturally diverse or homogeneous a\ncountry\u2019s citizens are; if they are collectively able and\nwilling to perform the requisite political function of adequately\nprotecting and preserving human rights, then they are entitled to\npolitical self-determination\u201d (Wellman 2012, 52). The\npresumptive right to exclude does not cancel duties of international\ndistributive justice. It means that \u201cwhatever duties of\ndistributive justice wealthy states have to those abroad, they need\nnot be paid in the currency of open borders\u201d (Wellman 2012,\n 66).[17]\n\nNone of the authors involved in this debate consider that the current\nlevels of global inequality are morally acceptable or that prosperous\nliberal democratic states are doing enough to discharge their duties\nof international justice. Those who defend the state\u2019s right to\nexclude, like Wellman, recognize that \u201caffluent societies must\ndramatically relax their severe limits on immigration if they are\nunwilling to provide sufficient assistance in other ways\u201d\n(Wellman 2012, 77; see also Miller 2014, 368). As Kok-Chor Tan has\nremarked, \u201cthe national projects of well-off nations lose their\nlegitimacy if these nations are not also doing their fair share as\ndetermined by their duties of justice\u201d (Tan 2004, 129; see also\nBrock\n 2020).[18]\n Whether liberals should concentrate on reforming the international\nsystem or fight for both greater international distributive justice\nand more open borders remains open for debate. The two prescriptions\nare by no means incompatible: insisting on the illegitimacy of\nrestrictive immigration policies under current conditions is also a\nway of putting rich countries on the spot and of prodding them to\naccept their moral responsibilities towards the world\u2019s poor\n(Goodin 1992, 8).\n",
