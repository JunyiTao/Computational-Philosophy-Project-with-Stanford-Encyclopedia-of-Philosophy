    "main_text": "\n\nBehind the various Christian ideas about heaven and hell lies the more\nbasic belief that our lives extend beyond the grave (see the entry on\n afterlife).\n For suppose that our lives do not extend beyond the grave. In\naddition to excluding a variety of ideas about reincarnation and\nkarma, this would also preclude the very possibility of future\ncompensation of any kind for those who experience horrendous\nevil during their earthly lives. Indeed, despite their profound\ndifferences, many Christians (though perhaps not all) and many\natheists can presumably agree on one thing at least. If a young girl\nshould be brutally raped and murdered and this should be the end of\nthe story for the child, then a supremely powerful, benevolent, and\njust God would not exist. An atheist may seriously doubt whether\nany future compensation would suffice to justify a supreme\nbeing\u2019s decision to permit such an evil in the first place. But\nthe point is that even many Christians would concede that, apart from\nan afterlife, such an evil would constitute overwhelming evidence\nagainst the existence of God; some might even concede that such an\nevil would be logically (or metaphysically) inconsistent with\nGod\u2019s existence as well.\n\nIt is hardly surprising, then, that a belief in an afterlife should be\nan important part of the Christian tradition. Even if our lives do\nextend beyond the grave, however, the question remains concerning the\nnature of the future in store for us on the other side, and the\nvarious Christian views about heaven and hell are proposed answers to\nthis question. According to a relatively common view in the wider\nChristian culture, heaven and hell are essentially deserved\ncompensations for the kind of earthly lives we live. Good people go to\nheaven as a deserved reward for a virtuous life, and bad people go to\nhell as a just punishment for an immoral life; in that way, the scales\nof justice are sometimes thought to balance. But virtually all\nChristian theologians regard such a view, however common it may be in\nthe popular culture, as overly simplistic and unsophisticated; the\nbiblical perspective, as they see it, is far more subtly nuanced than\nthat.\n\nWhen we turn to the theological and philosophical literature in the\nChristian tradition, we encounter, as we would in any of the other\ngreat religious traditions as well, a bewildering variety of different\n(and often inconsistent) theological views. The views about hell in\nparticular include very different conceptions of divine love, divine\njustice, and divine grace, very different ideas about free will and\nits role (if any) in determining a person\u2019s ultimate destiny,\nvery different understandings of moral evil and the purpose of\npunishment, and very different views about the nature of moral\nresponsibility and the possibility of inherited guilt. There is also\nthis further complication: in the Abrahamic family of monotheistic\nreligions to which Christianity belongs (along with Judaism and\nIslam), theological reflection often includes an interpretation of\nvarious texts thought to be both sacred and authoritative. But the\nmeaning of these texts, particularly when read in their original\nlanguages, is rarely transparent to all reasonable interpreters; that\nis, not even all who regard a relevant text as authoritative seem able\nto agree on its correct interpretation. Still, despite this\nbewildering diversity of theological opinion, there may be a\nrelatively easy way to identify three primary eschatological views\nwithin the Christian religion and thus to organize the various ideas\nabout heaven and hell around these three primary views.\n",
