    "main_text": "The Principle of Non-Contradiction and Proximity to the Truth or the Truth-Like\n7. The Principle of Non-Contradiction and Proximity to the Truth or the Truth-Like\n\nAt the end of chapter 4, Aristotle says that however much things\n\u201care so and not so\u201d, there \u201cis a more and a less in\nthe nature of things\u201d, for someone who thinks that four things\nare five is less wrong than someone who thinks that they are a\nthousand, and so there must be some truth to which the more true is\nnearer. He adds that even if there is not some truth to which the more\ntrue is nearer, \u201cstill there is already something firmer and\nliker the truth, and we shall have got rid of the unqualified doctrine\nwhich would prevent us from having anything definite in our\nthought\u201d (Metaph IV 4 1009a2\u20135). He first points\nout that we can make comparative judgments, even if we do not make\nabsolute judgments, and that comparative judgments presuppose some\nabsolute standard. But even if there is no absolute standard,\nsomething truth-like is presupposed and so we will not be prevented\nfrom having anything definite in our thought.\n\nOne might wonder how much of a concession these points are to\nAristotle\u2019s opponent. A modern scientific realist would insist\nthat our views merely approximate the truth. But would it be enough\nthat there be something \u201cliker the truth\u201d? It would be\ninteresting to work out the implications of these ideas for\nAristotle\u2019s essentialism. Would Aristotle be sympathetic to\n\u201cfuzzy essentialism\u201d or \u201cfuzzy realism\u201d? How\nmuch vagueness can Aristotelian realism allow? These are issues about\nrealism that later Hellenistic philosophers and modern philosophers\nconsider in more detail.\n",
