    "main_text": "Holist Underdetermination and Challenges to Scientific Rationality || Challenging the Rationality of Science\n2.2 Challenging the Rationality of Science\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that such holist underdetermination has\nbeen taken to pose a threat to the fundamental rationality of the\nscientific enterprise. The claim that the empirical evidence alone\nunderdetermines our response to failed predictions or recalcitrant\nexperience might even seem to invite the suggestion that what\nsystematically steps into the breach to do the further work of\nsingling out just one or a few candidate responses to disconfirming\nevidence is something irrational or at least arational in character.\nImre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend each suggested that because of\nunderdetermination, the difference between empirically successful and\nunsuccessful theories or research programs is largely a function of\nthe differences in talent, creativity, resolve, and resources of those\nwho advocate them. And at least since the influential work of Thomas\nKuhn, one important line of thinking about science has held that it is\nultimately the social and political interests (in a suitably broad\nsense) of scientists themselves which serve to determine their\nresponses to disconfirming evidence and therefore the further\nempirical, methodological, and other commitments of any given\nscientist or scientific community. Mary Hesse suggests that Quinean\nunderdetermination showed why certain \u201cnon-logical\u201d and\n\u201cextra-empirical\u201d considerations must play a role in\ntheory choice, and claims that \u201cit is only a short step from\nthis philosophy of science to the suggestion that adoption of such\ncriteria, that can be seen to be different for different groups and at\ndifferent periods, should be explicable by social rather than logical\nfactors\u201d (1980, 33). Perhaps the most prominent modern day\ndefenders of this line of thinking are those scholars in the sociology\nof scientific knowledge (SSK) movement and in feminist science studies\nwho argue that it is typically the career interests, political\naffiliations, intellectual allegiances, gender biases, and/or pursuit\nof power and influence by scientists themselves which play a crucial\nor even decisive role in determining precisely which beliefs are\nabandoned or retained when faced with conflicting evidence (classic\nworks in SSK include Bloor 1991, Collins 1992, and Shapin and Schaffer\n1985; in feminist science studies, see Longino, 1990, 2002, and for a\nrecent review, Nelson 2022). The shared argumentative schema here is\none on which holist underdetermination ensures that the evidence alone\ncannot do the work of picking out a unique response to failed\npredictions or recalcitrant experience, thus something else must step\nin to do the job, and sociologists of scientific knowledge, feminist\ncritics of science, and other interest-driven theorists of science\neach have their favored suggestions close to hand. (For useful further\ndiscussion, see Okasha 2000. Note that historians of science have also\nappealed to underdetermination in presenting \u201ccounterfactual\nhistories\u201d exploring the ways in which important historical\ndevelopments in science might have turned out quite differently than\nthey actually did; see, for example, Radick 2023.) \n\nIn response to this line of argument, Larry Laudan (1990) argues that\nthe significance of such underdetermination has been greatly\nexaggerated. Underdetermination actually comes in a wide variety of\nstrengths, he insists, depending on precisely what is being asserted\nabout the character, the availability, and (most importantly) the\nrational defensibility of the various competing hypotheses or\nways of revising our beliefs that the evidence supposedly leaves us\nfree to accept. Laudan usefully distinguishes a number of different\ndimensions along which claims of underdetermination vary in strength,\nand he goes on to insist that those who attribute dramatic\nsignificance to the thesis that our scientific theories are\nunderdetermined by the evidence defend only the weaker versions of\nthat thesis, yet draw dire consequences and shocking morals regarding\nthe character and status of the scientific enterprise from much\nstronger versions. He suggests, for instance, that Quine\u2019s\nfamous claim that any hypothesis can be preserved \u201ccome what\nmay\u201d in the way of evidence can be defended simply as a\ndescription of what it is psychologically possible for human\nbeings to do, but Laudan insists that in this form the thesis is\nsimply bereft of interesting or important consequences for\nepistemology\u2014 the study of knowledge. Along this\ndimension of variation, the strong version of the thesis asserts that\nit is always normatively or rationally defensible to retain\nany hypothesis in the light of any evidence whatsoever, but this\nlatter, stronger version of the claim, Laudan suggests, is one for\nwhich no convincing evidence or argument has ever been offered. More\ngenerally, Lauden argues, arguments for underdetermination turn on\nimplausibly treating all logically possible responses to the evidence\nas equally justified or rationally defensible. For example, Laudan\nsuggests that we might reasonably hold the resources of deductive\nlogic to be insufficient to single out just one acceptable\nresponse to disconfirming evidence, but not that deductive logic\nplus the sorts of ampliative principles of good reasoning\ntypically deployed in scientific contexts are insufficient to do\nso. Similarly, defenders of underdetermination might assert the\nnonuniqueness claim that for any given theory or web of\nbeliefs, either there is at least one alternative that can also be\nreconciled with the available evidence, or the much stronger claim\nthat all of the contraries of any given theory can be\nreconciled with the available evidence equally well. And the claim of\nsuch \u201creconciliation\u201d itself disguises a wide range of\nfurther alternative possibilities: that our theories can be made\nlogically compatible with any amount of disconfirming\nevidence (perhaps by the simple expedient of removing any claim(s)\nwith which the evidence is in conflict), that any theory may be\nreformulated or revised so as to entail any piece of\npreviously disconfirming evidence, or so as to explain\npreviously disconfirming evidence, or that any theory can be made to\nbe as well supported empirically by any collection of\nevidence as any other theory. And in all of these respects,\nLaudan claims, partisans have defended only the weaker forms of\nunderdetermination while founding their further claims about and\nconceptions of the scientific enterprise on versions much stronger\nthan those they have managed or even attempted to defend.\n\nLaudan is certainly right to distinguish these various versions of\nholist underdetermination, and he is equally right to suggest that\nmany of the thinkers he confronts have derived grand morals concerning\nthe scientific enterprise from much stronger versions of\nunderdetermination than they are able to defend, but the underlying\nsituation is somewhat more complex than he suggests. Laudan\u2019s\noverarching claim is that champions of holist underdetermination show\nonly that a wide variety of responses to disconfirming evidence are\nlogically possible (or even just psychologically possible), rather\nthan that these are all rationally defensible or equally\nwell-supported by the evidence. But his straightforward appeal to\nfurther epistemic resources like ampliative principles of belief\nrevision that are supposed to help narrow the merely logical\npossibilities down to those which are reasonable or rationally\ndefensible is itself problematic, at least as part of any attempt to\nrespond to Quine. This is because on Quine\u2019s holist picture of\nknowledge such further ampliative principles governing legitimate\nbelief revision are themselves simply part of the web of our\nbeliefs, and are therefore open to revision in response to\nrecalcitrant experience as well. Indeed, this is true even for the\nprinciples of deductive logic and the (consequent) demand for\nparticular forms of logical consistency between parts of the web\nitself! So while it is true that the ampliative principles we\ncurrently embrace do not leave all logically or even psychologically\npossible responses to the evidence open to us (or leave us free to\npreserve any hypothesis \u201ccome what may\u201d), our continued\nadherence to these very principles, rather than being willing\nto revise the web of belief so as to abandon them, is part of the\nphenomenon to which Quine is using underdetermination to draw our\nattention, and so cannot be taken for granted without begging the\nquestion. Put another way, Quine does not simply ignore the further\nprinciples that function to ensure that we revise the web of belief in\none way rather than others, but it follows from his account that such\nprinciples are themselves part of the web and therefore candidates for\nrevision in our efforts to bring the web of beliefs into conformity\n(by the resulting web\u2019s own lights) with sensory experience.\nThis recognition makes clear why it will be extremely difficult to say\nhow the shift to an alternative web of belief (with alternative\nampliative or even deductive principles of belief revision) should or\neven can be evaluated for its rational defensibility. Each proposed\nrevision is likely to be maximally rational by the lights of the\nprinciples it itself\n sanctions.[5]\n Of course we can rightly say that many candidate revisions would\nviolate our presently accepted ampliative principles of\nrational belief revision, but the preference we have for those rather\nthan the alternatives is itself simply generated by their position in\nthe web of belief we have inherited, and the role that they themselves\nplay in guiding the revisions we are inclined to make to that web in\nlight of ongoing experience.\n\nThus, if we accept Quine\u2019s general picture of knowledge, it\nbecomes quite difficult to disentangle normative from descriptive\nissues, or questions about the psychology of human belief revision\nfrom questions about the justifiability or rational defensibility of\nsuch revisions. It is in part for this reason that Quine famously\nsuggests (1969, 82; see also p 75\u201376) that epistemology itself\n\u201cfalls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of\nnatural science.\u201d His point is not that epistemology should\nsimply be abandoned in favor of psychology, but instead that there is\nultimately no way to draw a meaningful distinction between the two.\n(James Woodward, in comments on an earlier draft of this entry,\npointed out that this makes it all the harder to assess the\nsignificance of Quinean underdetermination in light of Laudan\u2019s\ncomplaint or even know the rules for doing so, but in an important way\nthis difficulty was Quine\u2019s point all along!) Quine\u2019s\nclaim is that \u201c[e]ach man is given a scientific heritage plus a\ncontinuing barrage of sensory stimulation; and the considerations\nwhich guide him in warping his scientific heritage to fit his\ncontinuing sensory promptings are, where rational, pragmatic\u201d\n(1951, 46), but the role of these pragmatic considerations or\nprinciples in selecting just one of the many possible revisions of the\nweb of belief in response to recalcitrant experience is not to be\ncontrasted with those same principles having rational or epistemic\njustification. Far from conflicting with or even being orthogonal to\nthe search for truth and our efforts to render our beliefs maximally\nresponsive to the evidence, Quine insists, revising our beliefs in\naccordance with such pragmatic principles \u201cat bottom, is what\nevidence is\u201d (1955, 251). Whether or not this strongly\nnaturalistic conception of epistemology can ultimately be defended, it\nis misleading for Laudan to suggest that the thesis of\nunderdetermination becomes trivial or obviously insupportable the\nmoment we inquire into the rational defensibility rather than the mere\nlogical or psychological possibility of alternative revisions to the\nholist\u2019s web of belief.\n\nIn fact, there is an important connection between this lacuna in\nLaudan\u2019s discussion and the further uses made of the thesis of\nunderdetermination by sociologists of scientific knowledge, feminist\nepistemologists, and other vocal champions of holist\nunderdetermination. When faced with the invocation of further\nampliative standards or principles that supposedly rule out some\nresponses to disconfirmation as irrational or unreasonable, these\nthinkers typically respond by insisting that the embrace of such\nfurther standards or principles (or perhaps their application to\nparticular cases) is itself underdetermined, historically\ncontingent, and/or subject to ongoing social negotiation. For this\nreason, they suggest, such appeals (and their success or failure in\nconvincing the members of a given community) should be explained by\nreference to the same broadly social and political interests that they\nclaim are at the root of theory choice and belief change in science\nmore generally (see, e.g., Shapin and Schaffer, 1985). On both\naccounts, then, our response to recalcitrant evidence or a failed\nprediction is constrained in important ways by features of the\nexisting web of beliefs. But for Quine, the continuing force of these\nconstraints is ultimately imposed by the fundamental principles of\nhuman psychology (such as our preference for minimal mutilation of the\nweb, or the pragmatic virtues of simplicity, fecundity, etc.), while\nfor constructivist theorists of science such as Shapin and Schaffer,\nthe continuing force of any such constraints is limited only by the\nongoing negotiated agreement of the communities of scientists who\nrespect them.\n\nAs this last contrast makes clear, recognizing the limitations of\nLaudan\u2019s critique of Quine and the fact that we cannot dismiss\nholist underdetermination with any straightforward appeal to\nampliative principles of good reasoning by itself does nothing to\nestablish the further positive claims about belief revision\nadvanced by interest-driven theorists of science. Conceding that\ntheory choice or belief revision in science is underdetermined by the\nevidence in just the ways that Duhem and/or Quine suggested leaves\nentirely open whether it is instead the (suitably broad) social or\npolitical interests of scientists themselves that do the further work\nof singling out the particular beliefs or responses to falsifying\nevidence that any particular scientist or scientific community will\nactually adopt or find compelling. Even many of those philosophers of\nscience who are most strongly convinced of the general significance of\nvarious forms of underdetermination remain deeply skeptical of this\nlatter thesis and thoroughly unconvinced by the empirical evidence\nthat has been offered in support of it (usually in the form of case\nstudies of particular historical episodes in science).\n\nAppeals to underdetermination have also loomed large in recent\nphilosophical debates concerning the place of values in science, with\na number of authors arguing that the underdetermination of theory by\ndata is among the central reasons that values (or\n\u201cnon-epistemic\u201d values) do and perhaps must play a central\nrole in scientific inquiry. Feminist philosophers of science have\nsometimes suggested that it is such underdetermination which creates\nroom not only for unwarranted androcentric values or assumptions to\nplay central roles in the embrace of particular theoretical\npossibilities, but also for the critical and alternative approaches\nfavored by feminists themselves (e.g. Nelson 2022). But appeals to\nunderdetermination also feature prominently in more general arguments\nagainst the possibility or desirability of value-free science. Perhaps\nmost influentially, Helen Longino\u2019s \u201ccontextual\nempiricism\u201d suggests that a wide variety of non-epistemic values\nplay important roles in determining our scientific beliefs in part\nbecause underdetermination prevents data or evidence alone from doing\nso. For this and other reasons she concludes that objectivity in\nscience is therefore best served by a diverse set of participants who\nbring a variety of different values or value-laden assumptions to the\nenterprise (Longino 1990, 2002).\n",
