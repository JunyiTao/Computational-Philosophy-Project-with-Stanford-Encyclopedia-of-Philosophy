    "main_text": "Atomism in the Seventeenth Century || Seventeenth-Century Eclecticism\n2.4 Seventeenth-Century Eclecticism\n Atomic theories became common in the seventeenth century. The\nemerging emphasis on experiment led the proponents of those theories\nto become less concerned with philosophical systems and more concerned\nwith the explanation of specific phenomena such as condensation and\nrarefaction, evaporation, the strength of materials and chemical\nchange. There was an increasing tendency for atomists to borrow in an\nopportunist way from both the mechanical and natural minima traditions\nas well as from the alchemical tradition which employed atomistic\ntheories of its own as Newman (1991, 143\u2013190 and 1994,\n92\u2013114) has documented. Thus an Aristotelian proponent of the\nnatural minima tradition, Daniel Sennert, whose main interest was in\nchemistry in medical contexts, drew on the work of the alchemists as\nwell as that of the minima theorists, employed minima in physical as\nwell as chemical contexts, and insisted that his atomism had much in\ncommon with that of Democritus (Clericuzio, 2000, 23\u201329 and\nMelsen, 1952, 81\u201389). Boyle referred to his mechanical atoms as\nnatural minima and his first account of atomism involved attributing\nto an atom properties distinctive of the substance it was a least part\nof (Newman, 2006, 162ff, Clericuzio, 2000, 166ff) and in fact borrowed\nheavily from Sennert (Newman, 1996). In subsequent writings he made it\nclear that in his view least parts of substances are composed of more\nelementary particles possessing only shape, size and a degree of\nmotion. Whether, according to Boyle, properties other than primary\nmechanical ones emerge at the level of least parts or at the\nmacroscopic level is an issue on which contemporary commentators\ndisagree (Chalmers, 2009, 155\u2013161), Chalmers, 2010, 8\u20139,\nClericuzio, 2000, 103\u2013148, Newman, 2006, 179\u2013189). The\ntheories of a number of atomists, such as Sebastien Basso, Etienne de\nClave and Thomas Digges, were an eclectic mixture of ingredients drawn\nfrom mechanical atomism, minima theory and alchemy. (Clericuzio, 2000,\nMelsen, 1952, Newman, 2006)\n\n\nThe seventeenth-century certainly witnessed the growth of a range of\nexperimental sciences, an occurrence of considerable epistemological\nsignificance. However, the experimental basis for seventeenth-century\natomism remained extremely weak and none of the various versions of it\ncan be said to have productively informed experiment or to have been\nconfirmed by it, a claim that has been documented by Meinel (1988) in\nhis survey of the experimental basis for atomism in the seventeenth\ncentury and is argued in detail in Chalmers (2009). Appeal to atoms to\nexplain the gradual wearing away of a stone, the evaporation of a\nliquid, the passage of a solution through a filter paper folded\nmultiple times and so on dated back at least as far as Lucretius and\nwere hardly sufficiently powerful to convince anyone disinclined to\naccept the reality of atoms. Experimental knowledge of the combination\nand recovery of reacting chemicals, which certainly experienced marked\ngrowth in the course of the seventeenth century, did not of itself\nwarrant the assumption that atoms were involved. Evidence revealed by\nthe microscope was new to the seventeenth century, of course, and did\nreveal a microscopic world previously unknown. But the properties of\nmicroscopic systems were not qualitatively distinct from macroscopic\nones in a way that aided the demonstration of the emergence of the\nproperties of observable systems, whether microscopic or macroscopic,\nfrom the properties of atoms.\n\nSuggested Readings: Clericuzio (2000) is a detailed survey of\nseventeenth-century atomic theories. Stewart (1979) is a collection of\nBoyle's philosophical papers related to his mechanical\natomism. Boyle's atomism is detailed in Newman(2006) and Chalmers\n(2009). Debates concerning the nature and status of it are in\nChalmers(1993), Chalmers (2002), Chalmers (2009), Chalmers (2010),\nNewman (2006), Newman (2010), Anstey (2002) and Pyle (2002).\n",
