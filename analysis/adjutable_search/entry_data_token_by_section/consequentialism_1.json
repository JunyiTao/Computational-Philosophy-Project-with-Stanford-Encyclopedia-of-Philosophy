    "main_text": "What is Consequentialism?\n2. What is Consequentialism?\n\nThis array of alternatives raises the question of which moral theories\ncount as consequentialist (as opposed to deontological) and why. In\nactual usage, the term \u201cconsequentialism\u201d seems to be used\nas a family resemblance term to refer to any descendant of classic\nutilitarianism that remains close enough to its ancestor in the\nimportant respects. Of course, different philosophers see different\nrespects as the important ones (Portmore 2020). Hence, there is no\nagreement on which theories count as consequentialist under this\ndefinition.\n\nTo resolve this vagueness, we need to determine which of the various\nclaims of classic utilitarianism are essential to consequentialism.\nOne claim seems clearly necessary. Any consequentialist theory must\naccept the claim that I labeled \u201cconsequentialism\u201d,\nnamely, that certain normative properties depend only on consequences.\nIf that claim is dropped, the theory ceases to be\nconsequentialist.\n\nIt is less clear whether that claim by itself is sufficient to make a\ntheory consequentialist. Several philosophers assert that a moral\ntheory should not be classified as consequentialist unless it is\nagent-neutral (McNaughton and Rawling 1991, Howard-Snyder 1994, Pettit\n1997). This narrower definition is motivated by the fact that many\nself-styled critics of consequentialism argue against\nagent-neutrality.\n\nOther philosophers prefer a broader definition that does not require a\nmoral theory to be agent-neutral in order to be consequentialist\n(Bennett 1989; Broome 1991, 5\u20136; and Skorupski 1995). Criticisms\nof agent-neutrality can then be understood as directed against one\npart of classic utilitarianism that need not be adopted by every moral\ntheory that is consequentialist. Moreover, according to those who\nprefer a broader definition of consequentialism, the narrower\ndefinition conflates independent claims and obscures a crucial\ncommonality between agent-neutral consequentialism and other moral\ntheories that focus exclusively on consequences, such as moral egoism\nand recent self-styled consequentialists who allow agent-relativity\ninto their theories of value (Sen 1982, Broome 1991, Portmore 2001,\n2003, 2011).\n\nA definition solely in terms of consequences might seem too broad,\nbecause it includes absurd theories such as the theory that an act is\nmorally right if it increases the number of goats in Texas. Of course,\nsuch theories are implausible. Still, it is not implausible to call\nthem consequentialist, since they do look only at consequences. The\nimplausibility of one version of consequentialism does not make\nconsequentialism implausible in general, since other versions of\nconsequentialism still might be plausible.\n\nBesides, anyone who wants to pick out a smaller set of moral theories\nthat excludes this absurd theory may talk about evaluative\nconsequentialism, which is the claim that moral rightness depends only\non the value of the consequences. Then those who want to talk about\nthe even smaller group of moral theories that accepts both evaluative\nconsequentialism and agent-neutrality may describe them as\nagent-neutral evaluative consequentialism. If anyone still insists on\ncalling these smaller groups of theories by the simple name,\n\u2018consequentialism\u2019, this narrower word usage will not\naffect any substantive issue.\n\nStill, if the definition of consequentialism becomes too broad, it\nmight seem to lose force. Some philosophers have argued that any moral\ntheory, or at least any plausible moral theory, could be represented\nas a version of consequentialism (Sosa 1993, Portmore 2009, Dreier\n1993 and 2011; but see Brown 2011). If so, then it means little to\nlabel a theory as consequentialist. The real content comes only by\ncontrasting theories that are not consequentialist.\n\nIn the end, what matters is only that we get clear about which\ntheories a particular commentator counts as consequentialist or not\nand which claims are supposed to make them consequentialist or not.\nOnly then can we know which claims are at stake when this commentator\nsupports or criticizes what they call \u201cconsequentialism\u201d.\nThen we can ask whether each objection really refutes that particular\nclaim.\n",
