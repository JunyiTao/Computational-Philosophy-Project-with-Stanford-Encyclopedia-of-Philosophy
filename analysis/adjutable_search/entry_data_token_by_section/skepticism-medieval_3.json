    "main_text": "Skepticism in Pre-Scholastic Christian Philosophy || Augustine\n2.1 Augustine\n\nAugustine of Hippo (354\u2013430) was a classically trained\nrhetorician who explored many different schools of thought (Platonism,\nManicheanism, and Skepticism) before converting to Christianity. After\nhis conversion, he began to write philosophical and theological works\naddressing some of the views from these schools. The most important\nanti-skeptical work was his Contra Academicos (Against\nthe Academicians), which has been discussed by Matthews (1977 and\n1992), Burnyeat (1982), King (1995), Curley (1997), O\u2019Daly\n(2001), Bolyard (2006), and Dutton (2016).\n\nIn Contra Academicos, Augustine targets a few key Academic\nclaims: (a) that appealing to truthlikeness or plausibility is\ncoherent; (b) that skeptics are wise; (c) that nothing can be known;\nand finally (d) that skepticism leads to tranquility.\n\nAccording to Augustine, three of the four claims can be relatively\nquickly dispatched. The first claim, concerning truthlikeness, cannot\nfunction alone as a standard, since one cannot know that something is\nlike the truth without also knowing the truth itself. Second,\nskeptics cannot be wise, since wisdom requires knowledge of some sort.\nThird, skepticism leads away from tranquility, rather than towards it,\nsince it puts one at odds with the morals of the rest of society,\nwhich in turn is likely to lead to strife.\n\nThe most important claim for the epistemological history of the\nproblem is the third: that nothing whatsoever can be known. Augustine\ntreats of it in some detail.\n\nHe casts the issue as follows. The skeptic argues that a wise man must\nretreat to skepticism since nothing can be known. This inability is\ndue to the fact that knowledge of a truth\u2014at least as understood\nby certain Stoics\u2014is only possible if that truth could not\npossibly be caused to appear mentally by something different than what\nit is in fact caused by. For example, if an internal mental image or\nconcept of a tree\u2019s being beside a house could be\ncaused by a dream, then the tree\u2019s being beside the house cannot\nbe known, even if the tree is in fact beside the house. With\nthese stringent causal requirements, it is unsurprising to find that\nAcademic Skeptics take the line they do: since no appearance meets\nthis strict standard, they argue, it follows that nothing at all can\nbe known.\n\nAugustine thinks this standard can be met, however, at least in some\ncases. Augustine aims to uncover propositions about which doubt is an\nutter impossibility. He soon finds the following four disjunctive\nstatements:\n\nI still know something about physics. For I am certain that (1) there\nis either one world or not. And (2) if there is not just one, the\nnumber of them is either finite or infinite\u2026 In the same way, I\nknow that (3) our world is disposed as it is either by the nature of\nbodies or by some plan. And I know that (4) (a) either it always did\nexist and always will, or (b) it started to exist and will never stop,\nor (c) it did not start in time but will have an end, or (d) it\nstarted and will not last forever\u2026These truths are [logical]\ndisjunctions, and no one can confuse a likeness of something false\nwith them. (Contra Academicos 3.10.23)\n\n\nIn short, Augustine challenges the skeptic to convince him that such\nexhaustive, disjunctive propositions can be confused with, or have a\nlikeness of, what is false.\n\nAt this point that the skeptic counters with external world\nskepticism: \u201cHow do you know this world exists\u2026if the\nsenses are fallible?\u201d In other words, the skeptic argues, these\ndisjunctive statements about the external, physical world all assume\nthe existence of an external world, and thus they cannot be known to\nbe true if the external world itself cannot be known to exist. If\nexternal world skepticism can be maintained, it follows that\nAugustine\u2019s disjunctions can be mistaken for what is\nfalse, and thus this particular argument against global skepticism\nwill fail.\n\nAugustine\u2019s primary response to the external-world skeptic is\nAugustine\u2019s claim that things \u201cseem\u201d to him, and\nthat these seemings constitute the world. He supports this view by\narguing that seemings are required in order for error to\noccur\u2014otherwise, what would we be mistaken about? And since the\npossibility of error is the main impetus for skeptical doubt,\nskepticism requires the admission that things seem. In other words,\nfor Augustine, one cannot doubt that one has mental content, even if\none might have doubt about whether this content corresponds to\nanything external to the mind.\n\nAugustine gives further, more central arguments against global\nskepticism as Contra Academicos continues, claiming\nmathematical truths (e.g., \u201c2 + 3 = 5\u201d) and logical truths\n(e.g., \u201cnothing both is and is not\u201d) to be undoubtedly\ntrue. As with the physical disjunctions, such truths can be known\nwithout knowing external objects with any determinacy.\n\nBeyond his discussions in the Contra Academicos, Augustine\nfrequently tackles epistemological topics in other works. Most\nfamously, Augustine makes proto-Cartesian moves frequently, arguing\nthat the mere fact that he doubts and has various other mental\nhappenings proves his own existence:\n\n\u2026who would doubt that he lives, remembers, understands, wills,\nthinks, knows, and judges? For even if he doubts, he lives; if he\ndoubts, he remembers why he doubts; if he doubts, he understands that\nhe doubts; if he doubts, he wishes to be certain; if he doubts, he\nthinks; if he doubts, he knows that he does not know; if he doubts, he\njudges that he ought not to consent rashly. Whoever then doubts about\nanything else ought never to doubt about all of these\u2026 (On\nthe Trinity 10.10.14)\n\n\nLater, Augustine will draw on his theory of illumination to provide\nthe grounds for certainty. According to this theory, God\u2019s\nDivine Ideas serve as the guarantors of certainty, and they function\nin much the way that Plato\u2019s Forms do. Augustine first presents\nthis view in De Magistro (On the Teacher), and he\nmakes other references to it in later works. Augustinian Illumination\nhas been widely discussed in the secondary literature, and Nash (1969)\nstill remains one of the best introductions to the position.\n",
