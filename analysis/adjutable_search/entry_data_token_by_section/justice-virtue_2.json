    "main_text": "Social Psychology and Justice\n2. Social Psychology and Justice\n\n20th-century developmental psychology drew deeply on the Kantian\nlegacy. Piaget (1932/1948) treated moral development as principally\ninvolving increasing cognitive sophistication. More particularly,\nPiaget saw that sophistication as a matter of taking more and more\ngeneral or universal views of moral issues, and endorsed the Kantian\nand rationalist idea that morality rests on and can be justified in\nterms of considerations of justice. Piaget saw a \u201claw of\nevolution\u201d in moral development, from an understanding of rules\n(including moral rules) as being \u201cheteronomous\u201d\nimpositions of authority, to which one is objectively responsible, to\na grounding in mutual respect, accompanied by subjective\nresponsibility to others (Piaget 1932/1948, p. 225). This transition\nis fostered through social interaction, and attention to norms of\nequality and reciprocity replace those of mere obedience.\n\nEducational psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg was inspired by Piaget to\npropose a conception of moral development that postulated six stages\nof human moral development. In his earliest work, Kohlberg identified\nthe highest stage of such development with a concern for justice and\nhuman rights based on universal principles. Concern for relationships\nand for individual human well-being was embedded in a framework of\nconformity to social norms, at lower stages of the process. Moreover,\nhe saw the ordering of the different stages in Piagetian fashion as\nbasically reflecting differences in rational understanding: those\nwhose moral thinking involved the invoking of universal principles of\njustice and rights were thought to show a more advanced cognitive\ndevelopment than those whose moral thought appeals primarily to the\nimportance of relationships and of human well-being or suffering. The\nparadigm of moral development involves judgments that are\n\u201creversible,\u201d in the sense that each party to the issue\ncan accept the correct judgment by reversing his or her perspective\nand taking up the viewpoint of the other (Kohlberg 1981). The\nsophisticated moral reasoner will engage in a process of \u201cmoral\nmusical chairs,\u201d taking up the positions of the parties to the\nconflict successively. It is, on this version of Kohlberg\u2019s\nthought, that formal feature of the deliberative process that is\ncharacteristic of greatest moral development. As his research and\nthought progressed, however, Kohlberg increasingly acknowledged that\nthese formal features were less characteristic of overall moral\ndevelopment and thought than of the deployment of specifically\njustice-based concepts. In fact, Kohlberg was impressed by the work of\nRawls, and thought that the nature of Rawls\u2019 \u201coriginal\nposition of equality\u201d exemplified the kind of reversibility that\nis paradigmatic of the highest form of moral thought (Kohlberg 1981,\np. 204). However, his approach treats utilitarianism as less\ncognitively advanced (more primitive) than rationalist views like\nKant\u2019s, and utilitarians (like R.M. Hare) naturally called into\nquestion the objectivity and intellectual fairness of Kohlberg\u2019s\naccount. \n\nMore significantly, perhaps, the evidence for Kohlberg\u2019s stage\nsequence was drawn from studies of boys, and when one applies the\nsequence to the study of young girls, it turns out that girls on\naverage end up at a less advanced stage of moral development than boys\ndo. In her 1982 book In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory\nand Women\u2019s Development, Carol Gilligan responded to\nKohlberg\u2019s views by questioning whether a theory of moral\ndevelopment based solely on a sample of males could reasonably be used\nto draw conclusions about the inferior moral development of women.\nGilligan argued that her own studies of women\u2019s development\nindicated that the moral development of girls and women proceeds and\nends in a different fashion from that of boys and men, but that that\nproves nothing about inferiority or superiority: it is merely a fact\nof difference. In particular, Gilligan claimed that women tend to\nthink morally in terms of connection to others (relationships) and in\nterms of caring about (responsibility for) those with whom they are\nconnected; men, by contrast and in line with Kohlberg\u2019s studies,\ntend to think more in terms of general principles of justice and of\nindividual rights against (or individual autonomy from) other people.\nBut Jean Hampton, among others, responded that Gilligan\u2019s\ncritique was itself a distortion, and that concerns for justice and\nindividual rights are as significant for and in the moral lives of\nwomen as for men (Hampton 1993).\n\nIn recent years, a variety of social sciences have intensified\ninvestigation into aspects of our natures that are plausibly important\nfor a virtue of justice. For example, Widlok 2018 surveys\ncross-cultural anthropological work examining the development of\n\u201cethical skill\u201d in rightful and just sharing practices.\n",
