    "main_text": "Monism || Token Identity\n5.1 Token Identity\n\nThe structure of Davidson\u2019s derivation of the token-identity of\ncausally interacting mental events with physical events appears to be\nstraightforward: causally interacting mental events (the interaction\nprinciple) must instantiate some strict law property (the cause-law\nprinciple) but mental properties are not suitable for inclusion in\nstrict laws (the anomalism principle). So mental events must\ninstantiate some other property, which is suitable for such inclusion.\nGiven Davidson\u2019s invocation of the causal closure of the\nphysical domain, according to which every physical event has a\nphysical explanation, he moves rather quickly to the conclusion that\nthis other property must be physical, since closure entails that\nphysical properties have a privileged status, which suggests that they\nhold out the promise of strict laws. (Davidson also has a tendency\nsimply to identify as \u2018physical\u2019 those properties that\nfigure in strict laws (Davidson 1970, 224; 1995a, 266), but this would\nof course beg the question of mental anomalism.) Consequently,\ncausally interacting mental events must be token-identical with\nphysical events, ruling out Cartesian as well as other forms of\ndualism.\n\nThere are serious problems with the assumption of causal closure of\nthe physical in Davidson\u2019s framework (for discussion, see the\nsupplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical in the Argument for Anomalous Monism).\n It is difficult, however, to see how Davidson can move from the claim\nthat mental events must instantiate non-mental, strict law properties\nto the claim that these properties must be physical without assuming\nclosure. Why assume that only \u2018physical\u2019 properties are\nnomic? This raises interesting issues about the nomic status of other\nspecial sciences\u2014the relevant ones here being biology and\nchemistry\u2014but there do not appear to be explicit, conclusive\nresources in Davidson\u2019s own thinking for addressing this.\nYalowitz 1998a has, however, provided an interpretation of Anomalous\nMonism stressing Davidson\u2019s views on causality and the nomic\nstatus of dispositions (see\n 4.3)\n in which causal closure is derived from the\ncause-law principle, token-identity and the anomalism of causally\ndefined properties. On this interpretation, the strict law properties\nthat mental events must instantiate turn out to be physical because\nonly physical properties are non-causally individuated\u2014all\nspecial science properties are causally individuated, and all such\nproperties are anomic.\n\nDavidson\u2019s token-identity theory is dramatically different than\nprevious identity theories of mind, in both it\u2019s a\npriori status as well as its stance towards the role of laws in\njustifying monism. Previous theories had argued that claims concerning\nthe identity of particular mental and physical events depended upon\nthe discovery of lawlike relations between mental and physical\nproperties. These theories thus held that empirical evidence\nsupporting such laws was required for particular identity claims.\nAccording to Anomalous Monism, however, it is precisely\nbecause there can be no such strict laws that causally\ninteracting mental events must be identical to some physical\nevent. The token-identity thesis thus requires no empirical evidence\nand depends on there being no lawlike relations. It in effect\njustifies the token-identity of mental and physical events through\narguing for the impossibility of type-identities between mental and\nphysical properties or kinds (Davidson 1970, 209, 212\u201313; see\nJohnston 1985).\n\nAn important point to recognize in Davidson\u2019s version of\ntoken-identity is that he is not simply deriving the conclusion that\nmental events bear some property that we would intuitively acknowledge\nas \u2018physical\u2019 (such as spatial location). As pointed out\nin\n 2.1,\n the relevant \u2018physical\u2019 properties would more likely have\nto resemble the sorts of properties currently invoked in physics, our\nmost mature science and the one closest to issuing in strict laws.\nThis point has generated numerous objections to Davidson\u2019s\ntoken-identity theory, but it also has been overlooked by some\nobjectors (see below). Davidson\u2019s central claim is that what\nmakes a mental event identical to a physical event is that the mental\nevent has a physical description. In Davidson\u2019s original\nformulation, monism entailed that every mental event can be\nuniquely singled out using only physical concepts (1970,\n215). It is this position that became the target of some\nDavidson\u2019s critics\n (5.2).\n However, Davidson eventually came to explicitly deny that his monism\ncommits him to the possibility of providing descriptions of mental\nevents or actions in physical terms suitable for strict laws (Davidson\n1999d, 639; 1999b, 653\u20134). He noted that strict laws will say\nsomething to the effect that \u201cwhenever there is a certain\ndistribution of forces and matter in a field of a certain size at time\nt, it will be followed by a certain distribution of forces\nand matter in a field of a certain size at time\nt\u2032\u201d (Davidson 1999d, 639). And he claimed that\nboth the antecedents and consequents of such laws, when covering\nparticular mental events and actions, will cover much larger regions\nof space than merely the agent or her action. Why? Because while\nsingular causal statements are singular, and therefore select\nfrom a complete set of causal factors those that are salient or in\nline with our particular explanatory interests, strict laws\ndon\u2019t themselves select\u2014\u201cthat\u2019s what makes\nthem strict\u201d (Davidson 1999d, 640; see Yalowitz 1998a for an\nextended discussion of this issue and its bearing on the argument for\nboth mental anomalism as well as monism). Davidson soft-pedals how\nthis view bears on the uniqueness claim in the official statement of\nAnomalous Monism, parsing away that claim in favor of the blander idea\nthat \u201csome physical description applies to each mental\nevent\u201d (Davidson 1999b, 654). As subtle as it seems, this\nappears to be a fundamental shift in Davidson\u2019s thinking about\nmonism, though it goes unexplored in his later work and has failed to\nattract the attention of his critics.\n\nIn any case, Anomalous Monism thus does not inherit the problem of how\nto justify specific identifications between mental and physical\nevents, because the claim that there is a physical description for\neach mental event is established purely a priori. And the\nphysical descriptions are not (indeed, cannot be) specifiable in\nprecise and uniquely identifying spatial and temporal terms. As we are\nabout to see\n (5.2),\n each of these points is overlooked by many of Davidson\u2019s\ncritics. That the latter is overlooked is understandable, given its\nlate appearance. However, the former point has always been\nfundamental, and critics\u2019 failure to appreciate it is\ncurious.\n\nDavidson additionally claims that the relation between the mental and\nphysical properties is not merely haphazard or coincidental. A\nrelationship of supervenience obtains between the two (Davidson 1970,\n214; 1973a, 253; 1993; 1995a, 266). (Davidson never argues for\nsupervenience. For discussion, see the supplement on\n Supervenience and the Explanatory Primacy of the Physical.)\n A working statement of this relationship is that if two events fail\nto share a mental property, they will fail to share at least one\nphysical property (Davidson 1995a, 266)\u2014or, equivalently, if two\nevents share all of their physical properties, they will share all of\ntheir mental properties. It is meant to articulate a kind of\ndependency of the mental on the physical, and correlatively a kind of\nexplanatory primacy to the physical, but without claiming any kind of\nreductive relation between the mental and the physical. The working\nstatement\u2019s truth depends, it seems, on the thought that the\ndistribution of physical properties somehow explains the\ndistribution of mental properties\u2014failure to share a mental\nproperty depends upon/is explained by failure to share at\nleast one physical property. The supervenience relation is usually\nunderstood to issue in generalizations of the following kind:\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\n\u2018P2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\netc. (where antecedent and consequent occur at the same time). This\nallows for the empirical possibility that a number of different\nphysical state kinds underlie the same mental state kind (for more on\nthis, see the supplement on\n Related Issues\n (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism)). However, it also\nappears to suggest the existence of lawlike relations between physical\nand mental properties, and so to be in tension with mental anomalism.\nThis issue will be explored in\n 5.3.\n",
