    "main_text": "Situationism in Philosophy\n1. Situationism in Philosophy\n\nIn the late 1960s and 70s, what became the situationist movement in\npsychology took center stage. An intense \u2018person-situation\ndebate\u2019 ensued which called into question the existence of\ntraditional personality traits and even the need for the discipline of\npersonality psychology. Writers describing this era called it\n\u201ctraumatic\u201d and \u201cintense\u201d, involving\n\u201cwarfare\u201d and \u201cheated but futile battles\u201d\n(Mischel 2009: 283, 1999b: 39). By the 1980s, though, many\npsychologists parted ways with the situationist movement, and today\nvery few would subscribe to the claims that were advanced at that\ntime.\n",
