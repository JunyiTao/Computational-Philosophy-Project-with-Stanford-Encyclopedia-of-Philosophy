    "main_text": "Perception, Concepts and Sense-Object Relations || Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Criticisms and New Definition\n7.3 Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Criticisms and New Definition\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba criticises Principle 1 on three grounds: (a) it\nentails that every awareness is perceptual since every awareness is\nproduced by the instrumentality of the \u2018inner\u2019 sense\nfaculty or manas; (b) it fails to include divine perception,\nwhich involves no sensory connection; and (c) there is no one type of\nsensory connection, nor anything obviously in common to the ad hoc\nlist of six types. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba therefore offers a new\ndefinition:\n\nPrinciple 3: A perceptual experience is a cognition\nwhich has no other non-mnemonic cognition as its \u2018special\u2019\ninstrumental cause (kara\u1e47a).\n\n\nTwo objections to this definition are countered. Objection 1: Since\nevery qualificative cognition is produced by a prior awareness of the\nqualifier, the definition under-extends. Reply: No. The awareness of\nthe qualifier is merely an auxiliary causal factor, the\n\u2018special\u2019 instrumental cause is a sense-object contact.\nObjection 2: Since recognition, which is a type of perception, does\nhave the prior awareness of the qualifier as its \u2018special\u2019\ninstrumental cause, the definition under-extends. Reply: No. The\n\u2018special\u2019 causal factor is the memory of the qualifier\ntriggered by the dispositional trace produced by the prior awareness,\nnot the prior awareness itself.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s definition has the virtue of capturing the\nsense in which perceptual experience is more \u2018immediate\u2019\nthan other types of experience, and is also applicable both to human\nand to divine perception. Restricted to human perception, it turns\ninto the previous definition (Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba says that the\n\u2018inner\u2019 sense should not be regarded as perceptual after\nall).\n",
