Ideas and the Vision in God\n\nIn a section of the third book of the Recherche devoted to\n\u201cthe nature of ideas,\u201d Malebranche argues for his famous\ndoctrine of the vision in God. More precisely, the thesis in this\nsection is that we see external objects by means of ideas in God. The\nargument for this thesis begins with the claim at the beginning of\nthis section that \u201ceveryone agrees that we do not perceive\nobjects external to us by themselves\u201d since it can hardly be the\ncase that \u201cthe soul should leave the body to stroll about the\nheavens to see the objects present there\u201d (Malebranche [OC],\n1:413). Arnauld later took exception to this starting point,\ncountering that \u201cideas, taken in the sense of representative\nbeings, distinct from perceptions, are not needed by our soul in order\nto see bodies\u201d (Arnauld 1683, 18). His main objection is that\nMalebranche stacked the deck in favor of his doctrine that we see\nideas of bodies in God by assuming from the start that these ideas are\ndistinct from our own perceptions.\n\nIn developing his own position, Arnauld appeals to Descartes\u2019\ndistinction in \u201cMeditation III\u201d between the formal reality\nof an idea as a perceptual modification of mind and its objective\nreality as something that represents an object. Arnauld insists that a\nrepresentative idea is simply the objective reality of a perception,\nand thus not something distinct from that perception. However, it is\nimportant to note that Malebranche\u2019s definition of an idea does\nnot rule out such a position from the start. As he himself insists to\nArnauld, the claim that we must perceive external objects through\nideas leaves open the question of whether an idea is \u201ca\nmodality of the soul, according to the opinion of M. Arnauld; an\nexpress species, according to certain philosophers, or an\nentity created with the soul, according to others; or finally\nintelligible extension rendered sensible by color or light,\naccording to my opinion\u201d (Malebranche [OC], 6:95).\n\nMalebranche\u2019s description of his own opinion goes beyond what\ncan be found in the original edition of the Recherche.\nHowever, his description of the other alternatives is drawn directly\nfrom this text. In particular, Malebranche had argued there that there\nare only four alternatives to the conclusion that we see bodies\nthrough ideas in God: (1) Bodies transmit resembling species to the\nsoul; (2) Our soul has the power to produce ideas when triggered by\nnon-resembling bodily impression; (3) Ideas are created with the soul\nor produced in it successively by God; and (4) Our soul sees both the\nessence and the existence of bodies by considering its own\nperfections. Malebranche told Arnauld that since this list constitutes\n\u201can exact division \u2026 of all the ways in which we can see\nobjects\u201d and since each of the alternative accounts yields\n\u201cmanifest contradictions,\u201d his argument from elimination\nserves to demonstrate the doctrine of the vision in God (Malebranche\n[OC], 6:198\u201399).\n\nIt is difficult to determine from the Recherche the precise\nsource of the enumeration. However, Connell (1967) has established\nthat Malebranche\u2019s argument was drawn from the account of\nangelic knowledge in the work of the Spanish scholastic, Francisco\nSu\u00e1rez (1548\u20131617). Particularly crucial for\nMalebranche\u2019s enumeration is Su\u00e1rez\u2019s claim that\nangels must know material objects through species that God adds to\ntheir mind given that God alone can know them through His own\nsubstance. In light of this claim, we can take Malebranche\u2019s\nfirst three hypotheses to cover the various ways in which we could\nperceive bodies through immaterial species \u201csuperadded\u201d to\nour soul, and his fourth hypothesis to cover the possibility that we\nperceive bodies in the perfections of our own soul. In arguing against\nthe last hypothesis, Malebranche notes that since a finite being can\nsee in itself neither the infinite nor an infinite number of beings\n(as Su\u00e1rez had argued in the case of angels), and since we in\nfact perceive both the infinite and infinity in external objects, it\nmust be that we see these objects by means of perfections contained in\nthe only being that can possess an infinity of ideas, namely, God\nHimself.\n\nMalebranche takes the conclusion here to confirm the view in \u201can\ninfinity of passages\u201d in Augustine that \u201cwe see God\u201d\nin knowing eternal truths. This appeal to the Augustinian theory of\ndivine illumination provides the basis for an argument for the vision\nin God that bypasses the unusual enumeration in the\nRecherche. This more direct argument is introduced in\n\u201cEclaircissement X,\u201d where Malebranche urges that the\nideas we perceive must exist in an \u201cimmutable and necessary\nReason\u201d since they are themselves immutable and necessary\n(Malebranche [OC], 3:129f). Malebranche emphasizes that the\nAugustinian view that eternal truths derive from uncreated features of\nthe divine intellect conflicts directly with the voluntarist\nconclusion in Descartes that these truths derive rather from\nGod\u2019s free and indifferent will. Particularly in his exchanges\nwith Arnauld, Malebranche attempts to present his doctrine of the\nvision in God as a natural consequence of Descartes\u2019 account of\nideas. However, his Augustinian argument serves to show that Descartes\nhimself could not have accepted this doctrine. Moreover, such an\nargument reveals the most fundamental reason for Malebranche\u2019s\nrejection of Arnauld\u2019s Cartesian identification of ideas with\nour own perceptions. Since Malebranche identifies these ideas with\nnecessary and immutable essences, and since he holds that these ideas\nderive their necessity and immutability from the divine intellect, he\nconcludes that Arnauld\u2019s position can only result in a radical\nsubjectivism that renders impossible any sort of a priori knowledge of\nthe material world.\n\n\u201cEclaircissement X\u201d also introduces the notion of\n\u201cintelligible extension\u201d mentioned in Malebranche\u2019s\nclaim to Arnauld quoted above concerning his own opinion. According to\nthis Eclaircissement, God has a single ideal extension that serves to\nrepresent particular bodies to Him. Arnauld objects that this position\ninvolves a retraction of the claim in the Recherche that we\nperceive bodies by means of distinct ideas in God. In response,\nMalebranche insists that his view all along was that God represents\nparticular bodies by means of His own simple \u201cabsolute\nbeing.\u201d For Arnauld, however, the view that God contains\nextension in this way is objectionable since it is connected to the\nheretical view in the work of the Dutch thinker Benedict Spinoza that\nGod is extended substance. The charge of Spinozism reappears in\nMalebranche\u2019s 1713\u201314 correspondence with one of his\nformer students, J.J. Dortous de Mairan (1678\u20131771), who later\nbecame the Secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences. As in the\ncase of Arnauld, so in this correspondence Malebranche vigorously\ndenies this charge. In both cases, he responds by emphasizing that the\ninfinite and indivisible ideal extension that exists in God differs\nfrom the finite and divisible extension in the material world. (For\nmore on Malebranche\u2019s notion of intelligible extension, see Reid\n2003; cf. the different interpretation of this notion in Nolan\n2012.)\n\nA final feature of Malebranche\u2019s doctrine of the vision in God\nis connected to the notion in his writings of the \u201cefficacious\nidea\u201d (id\u00e9e efficace). As first noted in Robinet\n(1965), this notion became entrenched in Malebranche\u2019s system\naround 1695, after his encounter with his Cartesian critic\nR\u00e9gis. In his Syst\u00eame de philosophie,\nR\u00e9gis had challenged the claim in the preface to the\nRecherche that our mind is united to God in a manner that\n\u201craises the mind above all things\u201d and is the source of\n\u201cits life, its light, and its entire felicity\u201d\n(Malebranche [OC], 1:9). While he grants the commonplace claim that\nGod must create and conserve our soul, R\u00e9gis denies that we are\nenlightened by means of a union with ideas of bodies in God. Rather,\nhe insists that God conserves in us ideas that derive directly from\nthe bodies they represent. In the 1693 R\u00e9ponse \u00e0\nR\u00e9gis (Response to R\u00e9gis), Malebranche\nemphasizes his Augustinian position that we can be instructed as to\nthe nature of bodies only through a union with God. However, he puts a\nnew spin on this position when he notes that the union with God\ninvolves an \u201caffecting\u201d or \u201ctouching\u201d of our\nmind by God\u2019s idea of extension.\n\nAlready in the 1688 Entretiens sur la m\u00e9taphysique,\nMalebranche had suggested that the union with God can be explicated in\nterms of a causal relation between God\u2019s ideas and our mind.\nAfter 1695, he develops this suggestion by introducing the notion of\n\u201cpure\u201d or non-sensory intellectual perceptions that are\nproduced by God\u2019s efficacious idea of extension. Yet he also\nstresses in this later period that such an idea is the causal source\nof our sensations. One advantage of this extension of the doctrine of\nefficacious ideas to sensations is that it yields a fairly clear\nexplanation of Malebranche\u2019s claim to Arnauld that an idea is\n\u201cintelligible extension rendered sensible by color or\nlight.\u201d Prior to 1695, Malebranche explained how intelligible\nextension is so rendered by appealing somewhat obscurely to the fact\nthat the soul \u201cattaches\u201d colors to a non-sensory idea.\nHowever, the theory of efficacious ideas allowed him to say that this\nidea is rendered sensible by causing in us the appropriate sensations\nof color and light. The claim that we see ideas in God is thus\ntransformed into the claim that our soul has intellectual and sensory\nperceptions that yield an understanding of the truth concerning bodies\nin virtue of their causal relation to God\u2019s idea of extension.\nDrawing on Robinet\u2019s results, one scholar has concluded that\nwhile Malebranche started with the vision in God, he ended\nwith a vision by God (Alqui\u00e9 1974, 209).\n",
