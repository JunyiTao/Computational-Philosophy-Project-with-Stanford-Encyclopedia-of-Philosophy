    "main_text": "Mathematical Tools: Models and Proofs || The proof-theoretic account of logical consequence\n3.2 The proof-theoretic account of logical consequence\n\nOn the proof-centered approach to logical consequence, the\nvalidity of an argument amounts to there being a proof of the\nconclusions from the premises. Exactly what proofs are is a\nbig issue but the idea is fairly plain (at least if you have been\nexposed to some proof system or other). Proofs are made up of small\nsteps, the primitive inference principles of the proof system. The\n20th Century has seen very many different kinds of proof systems, from\nso-called Hilbert proofs, with simple rules and complex axioms, to\nnatural deduction systems, with few (or even no) axioms and very many\nrules.\n\nThe proof-centered approach highlights epistemic aspects of logical\nconsequence. A proof does not merely attest to the validity of the\nargument: it provides the steps by which we can establish this\nvalidity. And so, if a reasoner has grounds for the premises of an\nargument, and they infer the conclusion via a series of applications\nof valid inference rules, they thereby obtain grounds for the\nconclusion (see Prawitz 2012). One can go further and subscribe to\ninferentialism, the view by which the meaning of expressions\nis determined by their role in inference. The idea is that our use of\na linguistic expression is regulated by rules, and mastering the rules\nsuffices for understanding the expression. This gives us a preliminary\nrestriction on what semantic values of expressions can be: they cannot\nmake any distinctions not accounted for by the rules. One can then go\neven further, and reject any kind of meaning that goes beyond the\nrules\u2014adopting the later Wittgensteinian slogan \u201cmeaning\nis use\u201d. This view is favored by anti-realists about meaning,\nsince meaning on this view is fully explained by what is knowable.\n\n\nThe condition of necessity on logical consequence obtains a new\ninterpretation in the proof-centered approach. The condition can be\nreformulated thus: in a valid argument, the truth of the conclusion\nfollows from the truth of the premises by necessity of thought\n(Prawitz 2005). Let us parse this formulation. Truth is\nunderstood constructively: sentences are true in virtue of\npotential evidence for them, and the facts described by true\nsentences are thus conceived as constructed in terms of potential\nevidence. (Note that one can completely forgo reference to truth, and\ninstead speak of assertibility or acceptance of sentences.) Now, the\nnecessity of thought by which an argument is valid is explained by the\nmeaning of the terms involved, which compels us to accept the truth of\nthe conclusion given the truth of the premises. Meanings of\nexpressions, in turn, are understood through the rules governing their\nuse: the usual truth conditions give their way to proof\nconditions of formulas containing an expression.\n\nOne can thus provide a proof-theoretic semantics for a\nlanguage (Schroeder-Heister 1991). When presenting his system of\nnatural deduction, Gentzen remarked that the introduction rules for\nthe logical expressions represent their \u201cdefinitions,\u201d and\nthe elimination rules are consequences of those definitions (Gentzen\n1933). For example, the introduction rule for conjunction dictates\nthat a conjunction \\(A \\amp B\\) may be inferred from both\nconjuncts \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and this rule captures the\nmeaning of the connective. Conversely, the elimination rule for\nconjunction says that from \\(A \\amp B\\) one may infer both\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The universal quantifier rules tell us that\nfrom the universally quantified claim \\(\\forall xFx\\) we can\ninfer any instance \\(Fa\\), and we can infer \\(\\forall xFx\\)\nfrom the instance \\(Fa\\), provided that no other assumption has\nbeen made involving the name \\(a\\). Under certain requirements,\none can show that the elimination rule is validated by the\nintroduction rule.\n\nOne of the main challenges for the proof-centered approach is that of\ndistinguishing between rules that are genuinely meaning-determining\nand those that are not. Some rules for connectives, if added to a\nsystem, would lead to triviality. Prior (1960) offered the following\nrules for a connective \u201c\\(\\tonk\\)\u201d. Its introduction rule says\nthat from \\(A\\) one can infer \\(A \\tonk B\\), and its\nelimination rule says that from \\(A \\tonk B\\) one can infer\n\\(B\\). With the introduction of these rules, the system becomes\ntrivial so long as at least one thing is provable, since from any\nassumption \\(A\\) one can derive any conclusion \\(B\\). Some\nconstraints have to posed on inference rules, and much of subsequent\nliterature has been concerned with these constraints (Belnap 1962,\nDummett 1991, Prawitz 1974).\n\nTo render the notions of proof and validity more systematized, Prawitz\nhas introduced the notion of a canonical proof. A sentence\nmight be proved in several different ways, but it is the direct, or\ncanonical proof that is constitutive of its meaning. A canonical proof\nis a proof whose last step is an application of an introduction rule,\nand its immediate subproofs are canonical (unless they have free\nvariables or undischarged assumptions\u2014for details see Prawitz\n2005). A canonical proof is conceived as giving direct evidence for\nthe sentence proved, as it establishes the truth of the sentence by\nthe rule constitutive of the meaning of its connectives. For more on\ncanonical proofs and the ways other proofs can be reduced to them, see\nthe entry on\n proof-theoretic semantics.\n\nWe have indicated how the condition of necessity can be interpreted in\nthe proof-centered approach. The condition of formality can be\naccounted for as well. Note that on the present perspective as well,\nthere is a division of the vocabulary into logical and nonlogical.\nThis division can be used to define substitutions of an\nargument. A substitution of an argument is an argument obtained from\nthe original one by replacing the nonlogical terms with terms of the\nsame syntactic category in a uniform manner. A definition of validity\nthat respects the condition of formality will entail that an argument\nis valid if and only if all its substitutions are valid, and in the\npresent context, this is a requirement that there is a proof of all\nits substitutions. This condition is satisfied in any proof system\nwhere rules are given only for the logical vocabulary. Of course, in\nthe proof-centered approach as well, there is a question of\ndistinguishing the logical vocabulary (see the entry on\n logical constants).\n\nFinally, it should be noted that a proof theoretic semantics can be\ngiven for classical logic as well as a variety of non-classical\nlogics. However, due to the epistemic anti-realist attitude that lies\nat the basis of the proof-centered approach, its proponents have\ntypically advocated\n intuitionistic logic\n (see Dummett 1991).\n\nFor more on the proof-centered perspective and on proof-theoretic\nsemantics, see the entry on\n proof-theoretic semantics.\n",
