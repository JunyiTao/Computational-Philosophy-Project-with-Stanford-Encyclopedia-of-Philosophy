    "main_text": "Justice and the Greenhouse Gas Budget || Equality\n6.2 Equality\n\nMany, that is, have endorsed what we might call the \u201cequal\nper capita\u201d view. This holds that rights to emit\ngreenhouse gases should be distributed equally. An important and\ninfluential statement of this position was affirmed by Anil Agarwal\nand Sunita Narain in Global Warming in an Unequal World\n(1991). They start from the premise that the atmosphere is part of the\n\u201cglobal commons\u201d (see also Shiva 2016). They infer from\nthis that it should be divided equally among all human beings. As they\nput it:\n\n\nThe question is how should this global common\u2014the global carbon\ndioxide and methane sinks\u2014be shared amongst the people of the\nworld? \u2026 [I]n a world that aspires to such lofty ideals like\nglobal justice, equity and sustainability, this vital global common\nshould be shared equally on a per capita basis. (Agarwal\n& Narain 1991: 9) \n\n\nSimilar positions have been taken by Dale Jamieson (2010:\n272\u2013273), and Steve Vanderheiden (2008: 107\u2013109 &\nchapter 7 [esp. 226\u2013227]). Peter Singer (2002: 43\u201344) has\nalso argued for it for partly moral and partly pragmatic reasons.\n\nBefore noting objections, it is worth observing that that the\n\u201cequal per capita view\u201d encompasses a family of\nviews and that one might distinguish between many different versions\nof this view. For example, one version holds that countries\nshould be ascribed rights to emit greenhouse gases and that the size of their quota should vary in line with the number of people in their society\n(Agarwal & Narain 1991: 9\u201310). However, one might interpret\nit in a more individualistic way, and ascribe equal rights to emit to each\nindividual.\n\nIn addition to this, there are different ways of treating past (and\ncurrent) emissions. Some, for example, hold that countries have\nemission rights and that a country\u2019s past emissions should be\ndebited from its quota (Neumayer 2000: esp. 186). Others suggest\ndisregarding past emissions and favour applying the equal per\ncapita emissions approach to the remaining budget (Singer 2002:\n43\u201344; Vanderheiden 2008: 229\u2013230). Still others argue\nthat we should phase in the equal per capita view gradually\nover time, and hence high emitters now will have more-than-equal\nemission rights at the start of the transition period, with their\nshare decreasing until it reaches equality (A. Meyer 2000).\n\nA number of different objections might be levelled against the equal\nper capita view (in all versions). First, some query why it\nis appropriate to treat this good in isolation. The equal per\ncapita view is a paradigm case of an isolationist position.\nHowever, theories of distributive justice tend to focus on the fair\ndistribution of a total package of goods (Bell 2008: esp. 250; Caney\n2012: 265\u2013271; Miller 2008: 142\u2013143). Of course,\nsometimes, in special cases, we do treat goods (e.g., rights to vote)\nin isolation, but it is not at all clear why that reasoning should\napply to this case and it is arguable that in these other cases they\nare grounded in a more general integrationist theory.\n\nSecond, it is worth asking why we should care about emissions at all.\nIn themselves they do not matter to the people who generate them or\nwho enjoy the goods and services whose production involves greenhouse\ngas emissions. They matter because they are a by-product of activities\nthat people engage in to serve important human interests. More\nspecifically they largely arise because of energy use (for building,\nheating, cooling, transporting, manufacturing, lighting and so on) and\nbecause of agriculture and land use change. Given this it makes sense\nto focus on protecting and promoting these interests (bearing in mind,\nof course, limits to emissions) not the distribution of emissions\nin themselves. Suppose, for example, that we compare two people, and\nlet us suppose that both enjoy whatever one takes to be the fair\ndistribution of goods overall. Suppose, for simplicity\u2019s sake,\nthat that is an equal standard of living. Suppose, however, that one\nmeets her interests through fossil fuels and the other through solar\nenergy, it is hard to see why that is necessarily unfair to the second\nperson. True they emit less. But that is irrelevant given that they\nenjoy what is, ex hypothesi, the fair standard of living\n(Hayward 2007: 432\u2013433 & 440\u2013444; Caney 2012:\n285\u2013291). In short: to care about emissions is not to care about\nwhat really matters from the point of view of justice.\n\nIt is worth noting that this objection tells not only against\nthe equal per capita view. It has force against all theories of distributive justice that\ntreat the right to emit as a distribuendum. It would, for example,\nbe an objection to the \u201csubsistence emissions\u201d approach\noriginally pioneered by Shue (Hayward 2007).\n\nThere is a third problem with treating emissions as an appropriate\ndistribuendum. The problem is that a dilemma arises when we\nconsider our responsibilities to future generations. There seem to be\nseveral options. Option 1 would be to deny that there are duties of\njustice to future generations to ensure that they too have rights to\nemit greenhouse gases. Perhaps someone might hold that there are no\nduties of justice at all to them (1a). Or they might hold that there\nare but that they do not include leaving them rights to emit (1b).\n(1a) seems implausible in light of the points made in\n Section 3;\n and (1b) adopts a discriminatory attitude to future people that\nstands in need of moral justification.\n\nA second option is to think that future people have rights and hence\nthat, on the view under consideration, they too have an equal right to\nemit greenhouse gases. If, however, one thinks that all current and\nfuture persons are entitled to equal per capita emissions\nthen we face two severe problems. (i) It will be exceptionally\ndifficult, if not impossible, to calculate how much everyone is\nentitled to. Furthermore, (ii), given the number of future and present\npeople included the equal per capita share would surely be\nclose to zero.\n\nIn light of these problems a better way forward would be not\nto focus on emissions per se, but rather to focus on meeting\npeople\u2019s interests in food and energy and so on, and to draw on\nother safe sources to meet these needs. What is imperative is to\ntransition away from a carbon-based economy towards one not dependent\non fossil fuels. Only in this way we can avoid the dilemma set out\nabove.\n",
