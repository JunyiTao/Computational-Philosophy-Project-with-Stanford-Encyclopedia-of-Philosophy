Introduction\n1.1 History\n\nBelief revision (belief change, belief dynamics) has been recognized\nas a subject of its own since the middle of the 1980s. It grew out of\ntwo converging research traditions.\n\nOne of these emerged in computer science. Since the beginning of\ncomputing, programmers have developed procedures by which databases\ncan be updated. The development of Artificial Intelligence inspired\ncomputer scientists to construct more sophisticated models of database\nupdating. The truth maintenance systems developed by Jon Doyle (1979)\nwere important in this development. One of the most significant\ntheoretical contributions was a 1983 paper by Ronald Fagin, Jeffrey\nUllman and Moshe Vardi, in which they introduced the notion of\ndatabase priorities. \n\nThe second of these two research traditions is philosophical. In a\nwide sense, belief change has been a subject of philosophical\nreflection since antiquity. In the twentieth century, philosophers\nhave discussed the mechanisms by which scientific theories develop,\nand they have proposed criteria of rationality for revisions of\nprobability assignments. Beginning in the 1970s, a more focused\ndiscussion has taken place on the requirements of rational belief\nchange. Two milestones can be pointed out. The first was a series of\nstudies conducted by Isaac Levi in the 1970s (Levi 1977, 1980). Levi\nposed many of the problems that have since then been major concerns in\nthis field of research. He also provided much of the basic formal\nframework. William Harper\u2019s (1977) work from the same period has\nalso had a lasting influence. \n\nThe next milestone was the AGM model, so called after its three\noriginators, Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n, Peter G\u00e4rdenfors, and\nDavid Makinson (1985). Alchourr\u00f3n and Makinson had previously\ncooperated in studies of changes in legal codes (Alchourr\u00f3n and\nMakinson 1981, 1982). G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s early work was concerned\nwith the connections between belief change and conditional sentences\n(G\u00e4rdenfors 1978, 1981). With combined forces the three wrote a\npaper that provided a new, much more general and versatile formal\nframework for studies of belief change. (On the history of their joint\nwork, see Makinson 2003 and G\u00e4rdenfors 2011.) Since the paper was\npublished in the Journal of Symbolic Logic in 1985, its major\nconcepts and constructions have been the subject of significant\nelaboration and development. The AGM model and developments that have\ngrown out of it still form the core of belief revision theory.\n1.2 The representation of beliefs and changes\n\nIn the AGM model and most other models of belief change, beliefs are\nrepresented by sentences in some formal language. Sentences do not\ncapture all aspects of belief, but they are the best general-purpose\nrepresentation that is presently available.\n\nThe beliefs held by an agent are represented by a set of such\nbelief-representing sentences. It is usually assumed that this set is\nclosed under logical consequence, i.e., every sentence that follows\nlogically from this set is already in the set. This is clearly an\nunrealistic idealization, since it means that the agent is taken to be\n\u201clogically omniscient\u201d, i.e. a perfect logical reasoner.\nHowever, it is a useful idealization since it simplifies the logical\ntreatment; indeed, it seems difficult to obtain an interesting formal\ntreatment without it. In logic, logically closed sets are called\n\u201ctheories\u201d. In formal epistemology they are also called\n\u201ccorpora\u201d, \u201cknowledge sets\u201d, or (more\ncommonly) \u201cbelief sets\u201d.\n\nIsaac Levi (1991) has clarified the nature of this idealization by\npointing out that a belief set consists of the sentences that someone\nis committed to believe, not those that she actually\nbelieves in. According to Levi, we are doxastically committed to\nbelieve in all the logical consequences of our beliefs, but typically\nour performance does not live up to this commitment. The belief set is\nthe set of the agent\u2019s epistemic commitments, and therefore\nlarger than the set of her actually held beliefs.\n\nIn the AGM framework, there are three types of belief change. In\ncontraction, a specified sentence \\(p\\) is removed, i.e., a\nbelief set \\(K\\) is superseded by another belief set \\(K\\div p\\) that\nis a subset of \\(K\\) not containing \\(p\\). In expansion a\nsentence \\(p\\) is added to \\(K\\), and nothing is removed, i.e. \\(K\\)\nis replaced by a set \\(K+p\\) that is the smallest logically closed set\nthat contains both \\(K\\) and \\(p\\). In revision a sentence\n\\(p\\) is added to \\(K\\), and at the same time other sentences are\nremoved if this is needed to ensure that the resulting belief set \\(K*\np\\) is consistent.\n\nIt is important to note the specific character of these models. They\nare input-assimilating. This means that the object of change,\nthe belief set, is exposed to an input, and is changed as a result of\nthis. No explicit representation of time is included. Instead, the\ncharacteristic mathematical constituent is a function that, to each\npair of a belief set and an input, assigns a new belief set.\n1.3 Formal preliminaries\n\nThe belief-representing sentences form a language. (As is usual in\nlogic, the language is identified with the set of all sentences it\ncontains.) Sentences, i.e. elements of this language, will be\nrepresented by lowercase letters \\((p, q\\ldots)\\) and sets of\nsentences by capital letters. This language contains the usual\ntruth-functional connectives: negation \\((\\neg)\\), conjunction\n\\((\\amp)\\), disjunction \\((\\vee)\\), implication \\((\\rightarrow)\\), and\nequivalence (\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)). \\(\\smbot\\) denotes an arbitrary\ncontradiction (\u201cfalsum\u201d), and \\(\\smtop\\) an arbitrary\ntautology.\n\nTo express the logic, a Tarskian consequence operator will be\nused. Intuitively speaking, for any set \\(A\\) of sentences, \\(\\Cn(A)\\)\nis the set of logical consequences of \\(A\\). More formally, a\nconsequence operation on a given language is a function \\(\\Cn\\) from\nsets of sentences to sets of sentences. It satisfies the following\nthree conditions:\n\nInclusion:\n\n\\(A\\subseteq \\Cn(A)\\)\n\nMonotony:\n\nIf \\(A\\subseteq B\\), then \\(\\Cn(A) \\subseteq \\Cn(B)\\)\n\nIteration:\n\n\\(\\Cn(A) = \\Cn(\\Cn(A))\\)\n\n\\(\\Cn\\) is assumed to be supraclassical, i.e. if \\(p\\) can be derived\nfrom \\(A\\) by classical truth-functional logic, then \\(p \\in \\Cn(A)\\).\n\\(A\\) is a belief set if and only if \\(A = \\Cn(A)\\). In what follows,\n\\(K\\) will denote a belief set. \\(X \\vdash p\\) is an alternative\nnotation for \\(p \\in \\Cn(X)\\), and \\(X \\not\\vdash p\\) for \\(p \\not\\in\n\\Cn(X)\\). \\(\\Cn(\\varnothing)\\) is the set of tautologies.\n\nThe expansion of \\(K\\) by a sentence \\(p\\), i.e. the operation that\njust adds \\(p\\) and removes nothing, is denoted \\(K+p\\) and defined as\nfollows: \\(K+p = \\Cn(K\\cup \\{p\\})\\).\n2. Contraction\n2.1 Partial meet contraction\n\nThe outcome of contracting \\(K\\) by \\(p\\) should be a subset of \\(K\\)\nthat does not imply \\(p\\), but from which no elements of \\(K\\) have\nbeen unnecessarily removed. Therefore, it is of interest to consider\nthe inclusion-maximal subsets of \\(K\\) that do not imply \\(p\\).\n\nFor any set \\(A\\) and sentence \\(p\\) the remainder set\n\\(A\\bot p\\) (\u201c\\(A\\) remainder \\(p\\)\u201d) is the set of\ninclusion-maximal subsets of \\(A\\) that do not imply \\(p\\). In other\nwords, a set \\(B\\) is an element of \\(A\\bot p\\) if and only if it it\nis a subset of \\(A\\) that does not imply \\(p\\), and there is no set\n\\(B'\\) not implying \\(p\\) such that \\(B\\subset B'\\subseteq A\\). The\nelements of \\(A\\bot p\\) are called \u201cremainders\u201d.\n\nIf the operation of contraction uncompromisingly minimizes information\nloss, then \\(K\\div p\\) will be one of the remainders. However, this\nconstruction can be shown to have implausible properties. A more\nreasonable recipe for contraction is to let \\(K\\div p\\) be the\nintersection of some of the remainders. This is partial meet\ncontraction, the major innovation in the classic 1985 paper by\nCarlos Alchourr\u00f3n, Peter G\u00e4rdenfors and David Makinson. An\noperation of partial meet contraction employs a selection\nfunction that selects the \u201cbest\u201d elements of \\(K\\bot\np\\). More precisely, a selection function for \\(K\\) is a function\n\\(\\gamma\\) such that if \\(K\\bot p\\) is non-empty, then \\(\\gamma(K\\bot\np)\\) is a non-empty subset of \\(K\\bot p\\). In the limiting case when\n\\(K\\bot p\\) is empty, then \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p)\\) is defined to be equal\nto \\(\\{K\\}\\).\n\nThe outcome of the partial meet contraction is equal to the\nintersection of the set of selected elements of \\(K\\bot p\\), i.e.\n\\(K\\div p = \\bigcap \\gamma(K\\bot p)\\).\n\nThe limiting case when for all sentences \\(p\\), \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p)\\)\nhas exactly one element is called maxichoice contraction. The\nother limiting case in which \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) = K\\bot p\\) whenever\n\\(K\\bot p\\) is non-empty is called full meet contraction.\nBoth limiting cases are technically useful, but they also both have\nhighly unrealistic properties.\n\nPartial meet contraction of a belief set satisfies six postulates that\nare called the basic G\u00e4rdenfors postulates (or basic AGM\npostulates). To begin with, when a belief set \\(K\\) is contracted by a\nsentence \\(p\\), the outcome should be logically closed.\n\nClosure:\n\n\\(K\\div p = \\Cn(K\\div p)\\) \n\nContraction should be successful, i.e., \\(K\\div p\\) should not imply\n\\(p\\) (or not contain \\(p\\), which is the same thing if Closure is\nsatisfied). However, it would be too much to require that \\(p \\not\\in\n\\Cn(K\\div p)\\) for all sentences \\(p\\), since it cannot hold if \\(p\\)\nis a tautology. The success postulate has to be conditional on \\(p\\)\nnot being logically true.\n\nSuccess:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K\\div p)\\).\n\n\nThe Success postulate has been put in doubt since there may be\nsentences other than tautologies that an epistemic agent may refuse to\nwithdraw. (On operations that do not satisfy Success, see Section\n6.5.)\n\nThe contracted set is assumed to be a subset of the original one:\n\nInclusion:\n\n\\(K\\div p \\subseteq K\\) \n\nInclusion is usually considered to be a constitutive property of\ncontraction. However, it has also been questioned with the argument\nthat when the epistemic agent ceases to believe in \\(p\\), then this is\nusually because she receives some new information that contradicts\n\\(p\\). Arguably, that information should be included in \\(K\\div p\\).\n\n\nIf the sentence to be contracted is not included in the original\nbelief set, then contraction by that sentence involves no change at\nall. Such contractions are idle (vacuous) operations, and they should\nleave the original set unchanged.\n\nVacuity:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K)\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\). \n\nLogically equivalent sentences should be treated alike in\ncontraction:\n\nExtensionality:\n\nIf \\(p\\leftrightarrow q \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\div\nq\\). \n\nExtensionality guarantees that the logic of contraction is extensional\nin the sense of allowing logically equivalent sentences to be freely\nsubstituted for each other.\n\nBelief contraction should not only be successful, it should also be\nminimal in the sense of leading to the loss of as few\nprevious beliefs as possible. The epistemic agent should give up\nbeliefs only when forced to do so, and should then give up as few of\nthem as possible. This is ensured by the following postulate:\n\nRecovery:\n\n\\(K \\subseteq (K\\div p)+p\\) \n\nAccording to Recovery, so much is retained after \\(p\\) has been\nremoved that everything will be recovered by reinclusion (through\nexpansion) of \\(p\\).\n\nOne of the central results about the AGM model is a representation\ntheorem for partial meet contraction. According to this theorem, an\noperation \\(\\div\\) is a partial meet contraction for a belief set\n\\(K\\) if and only if it satisfies the six above-mentioned postulates,\nnamely Closure, Success, Inclusion, Vacuity, Extensionality, and\nRecovery.\n\nA selection function for a belief set \\(K\\) should, for all sentences\n\\(p\\), select those elements of \\(K\\bot p\\) that are\n\u201cbest\u201d, or most worth retaining. However, the definition\nof a selection function is very general, and allows for quite\ndisorderly selection patterns. An orderly selection function should\nalways choose the best element(s) of the remainder set according to\nsome well-behaved preference relation. A selection function \\(\\gamma\\)\nfor a belief set \\(K\\) is relational if and only if there is\na binary relation \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) such that for all sentences \\(p\\), if\n\\(K\\bot p\\) is non-empty, then \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) = \\{B \\in K\\bot p\n\\mid C\\mathbf{R}B\\) for all \\(C \\in K\\bot p\\}\\). Furthermore, if\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is transitive (i.e., it satisfies: If \\(A\\mathbf{R}B\\)\nand \\(B\\mathbf{R}C\\), then \\(A\\mathbf{R}C)\\), then \\(\\gamma\\) and the\npartial meet contraction that it gives rise to are transitively\nrelational.\n\nIn order to characterize transitively relational partial meet\ncontraction, postulates are needed that refer to contraction by\nconjunctions.\n\nIn order to give up a conjunction \\(p \\amp q\\), the agent must\nrelinquish either her belief in \\(p\\) or her belief in \\(q\\) (or\nboth). Suppose that contracting by \\(p \\amp q\\) leads to loss of the\nbelief in \\(p\\), i.e., that \\(p \\not\\in K\\div(p \\amp q)\\). It can be\nexpected that in this case contraction by \\(p \\amp q\\) should lead to\nthe loss of all beliefs that would have been lost in order to contract\nby \\(p\\). Another way to express this is that everything that is\nretained in \\(K\\div(p \\amp q)\\) is also retained in \\(K\\div p\\):\n\nConjunctive inclusion:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in K\\div(p \\amp q)\\), then \\(K\\div(p \\amp q) \\subseteq\nK\\div p\\). \n\nAnother fairly reasonable principle for contraction by conjunctions is\nthat whatever can withstand both contraction by \\(p\\) and contraction\nby \\(q\\) can also withstand contraction by \\(p \\amp q\\). In other\nwords, whatever is an element of both \\(K\\div p\\) and \\(K\\div q\\) is\nalso an element of \\(K\\div(p \\amp q)\\).\n\nConjunctive overlap:\n\n\\((K\\div p) \\cap (K\\div q) \\subseteq K\\div(p \\amp q)\\) \n\nConjunctive overlap and Conjunctive inclusion are commonly called\nG\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s supplementary postulates for belief\ncontraction. An operation \\(\\div\\) for \\(K\\) is a transitively\nrelational partial meet contraction if and only if it satisfies the\nsix basic postulates and in addition both Conjunctive overlap and\nConjunctive inclusion.\n2.2 Entrenchment-based contraction\n\nWhen forced to give up previous beliefs, the epistemic agent should\ngive up beliefs that have as little explanatory power and overall\ninformational value as possible. As an example of this, in the choice\nbetween giving up beliefs in natural laws and beliefs in single\nfactual statements, beliefs in the natural laws, that have much higher\nexplanatory power, should in general be retained. This was the basic\nidea behind Peter G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s proposal that contraction of\nbeliefs should be ruled by a binary relation, epistemic\nentrenchment. (G\u00e4rdenfors 1988, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson\n1988) To say of two elements \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) of the belief set that\n\u201c\\(q\\) is more entrenched than \\(p\\)\u201d means that \\(q\\) is\nmore useful in inquiry or deliberation, or has more \u201cepistemic\nvalue\u201d than \\(p\\). In belief contraction, the beliefs with the\nlowest entrenchment should be the ones that are most readily given\nup.\n\nThe following symbols will be used for epistemic entrenchment:\n\n\n\\(p\\le q : p\\) is at most as entrenched as \\(q\\).\n\n\\(p\\lt q : p\\) is less entrenched than \\(q\\). \\(((p\\le q) \\amp\n\\neg(q\\le p)))\\)\n\n\\(p\\equiv q : p\\) and \\(q\\) are equally entrenched. \\(((p\\le q)\n\\amp(q\\le p))\\)\n\n\nG\u00e4rdenfors has proposed the following five postulates for\nepistemic entrenchment. They are often referred to as the standard\npostulates for entrenchment:\n\n\nTransitivity:\n\nIf \\(p\\le q\\) and \\(q\\le r\\), then \\(p\\le r\\).\n\nDominance:\n\nIf \\(p \\vdash q\\), then \\(p\\le q\\).\n\nConjunctiveness:\n\nEither \\(p\\le(p \\amp q)\\) or \\(q\\le(p \\amp q)\\).\n\nMinimality:\n\nIf the belief set \\(K\\) is consistent, then \\(p \\not\\in K\\) if and\nonly if \\(p\\le q\\) for all \\(q\\).\n\nMaximality:\n\nIf \\(q\\le p\\) for all \\(q\\), then \\(p \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\).\n\n\nIt follows from the first three of these postulates that an\nentrenchment relation satisfies connectivity (completeness), i.e. it\nholds for all \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) that either \\(p\\le q\\) or \\(q\\le\np\\).\n\nAn entrenchment relation \\(\\le\\) gives rise to an operation \\(\\div\\)\nof entrenchment-based contraction according to the following\ndefinition:\n\n\\(q \\in K\\div p\\) if and only if \\(q \\in K\\) and either \\(p \\lt(p \\vee\nq)\\) or \\(p \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\). \n\nEntrenchment-based contraction has been shown to coincide exactly with\ntransitively relational partial meet contraction. For a thorough\ndiscussion and more results on entrenchment relations, see Rott\n2001.\n2.3 Recovery and its avoidance\n\nRecovery is the most debated postulate of belief change. It is easy to\nfind examples that seem to validate Recovery. A person who first loses\nand then regains her belief that she has a dollar in her pocket seems\nto return to her previous state of belief. However, other examples can\nalso be presented, in which Recovery yields implausible results. The\nfollowing are two of the examples that have been offered to show that\nRecovery does not hold in general:\n\n\n\nI have read in a book about Cleopatra that she had both a son and a\ndaughter. My set of beliefs therefore contains both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\),\nwhere \\(p\\) denotes that Cleopatra had a son and \\(q\\) that she had a\ndaughter. I then learn from a knowledgeable friend that the book is in\nfact a historical novel. After that I contract \\(p\\vee q\\) from my set\nof beliefs, i.e., I do not any longer believe that Cleopatra had a\nchild. Soon after that, however, I learn from a reliable source that\nCleopatra had a child. It seems perfectly reasonable for me to then\nadd \\(p\\vee q\\) to my set of beliefs without also reintroducing either\n\\(p\\) or \\(q\\). This contradicts Recovery.\n\n\nI previously entertained the two beliefs \u201cGeorge is a\ncriminal\u201d \\((p)\\) and \u201cGeorge is a mass murderer\u201d\n\\((q)\\). When I received information that induced me to give up the\nfirst of these beliefs \\((p)\\), the second \\((q)\\) had to go as well\n(since \\(p\\) would otherwise follow from \\(q)\\).\n\nI then received new information that made me accept the belief\n\u201cGeorge is a shoplifter\u201d \\((r)\\). The resulting new belief\nset is the expansion of \\(K\\div p\\) by \\(r\\), \\((K\\div p)+r.\\) Since\n\\(p\\) follows from \\(r\\), \\((K\\div p)+p\\) is a subset of \\((K\\div\np)+r\\). By recovery, \\((K\\div p)+p\\) includes \\(q\\), from which\nfollows that \\((K\\div p)+r\\) includes \\(q\\).\n\nThus, since I previously believed George to be a mass murderer, it\nfollows from Recovery that I cannot after that believe him to be a\nshoplifter without believing him to be a mass murderer.\n\n\nDue to the problematic nature of this postulate, it should be\ninteresting to find intuitively less controversial postulates that\nprevent unnecessary losses in contraction. The following is an attempt\nto do that:\n\nCore-retainment:\n\nIf \\(q \\in K\\) and \\(q \\not\\in K\\div p\\), then there is a belief set\n\\(K'\\) such that \\(K' \\subseteq K\\) and that \\(p \\not\\in K'\\) but \\(p\n\\in K'+q\\). \n\nCore-retainment requires of an excluded sentence \\(q\\) that it in some\nway contributes to the fact that \\(K\\) implies \\(p\\). It gives the\nimpression of being weaker and more plausible than Recovery. However,\nit has been shown that if an operator \\(\\div\\) for a belief set \\(K\\)\nsatisfies Core-retainment, then it satisfies Recovery.\n\nAttempts have been made to construct operations of contraction on\nbelief sets that do not satisfy Recovery. Arguably, the most plausible\nof these constructions is the operation of severe withdrawal\nthat has been thoroughly investigated by Hans Rott and Maurice\nPagnucco (2000). It can be constructed from an operation of epistemic\nentrenchment by modifying the definition as follows:\n\n\\(q \\in K\\div p\\) if and only if \\(q \\in K\\) and either \\(p \\lt q\\) or\n\\(p \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\). \n\nSevere withdrawal has interesting features, but it also has the\nfollowing property:\n\nExpulsiveness:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\) and \\(q \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\)\nthen either \\(p \\not\\in K\\div q\\) or \\(q \\not\\in K\\div p\\). \n\nThis is a highly implausible property of belief contraction, since it\ndoes not allow unrelated beliefs to be undisturbed by each\nother\u2019s contraction. Consider a scholar who believes that her\ncar is parked in front of the house. She also believes that\nShakespeare wrote the Tempest. It should be possible for her to give\nup the first of these beliefs while retaining the second. She should\nalso be able to give up the second without giving up the first.\nExpulsiveness does not allow this. The construction of a plausible\noperation of contraction for belief sets that does not satisfy\nRecovery is still an open issue.\n3. Revision\n\nThe two major tasks of an operation \\(*\\) of revision are (1) to add\nthe new belief \\(p\\) to the belief set \\(K\\), and (2) to ensure that\nthe resulting belief set \\(K* p\\) is consistent (unless \\(p\\) is\ninconsistent). The first task can be accomplished by expansion by\n\\(p\\). The second can be accomplished by prior contraction by its\nnegation \\(\\neg p\\). If a belief set does not imply \\(\\neg p\\), then\n\\(p\\) can be added to it without loss of consistency. This composition\nof suboperations gives rise to the following definition of revision\n(G\u00e4rdenfors 1981, Levi 1977):\n\nLevi identity:\n\n\\(K* p = (K\\div \\neg p)+p\\). \n\nIf \\(\\div\\) is a partial meet contraction, then the operation \\(*\\)\nthat is defined in this way is a partial meet revision. This\nis the standard construction of revision in the AGM model.\n\nPartial meet revision has been axiomatically characterized. An\noperation \\(*\\) is a partial meet revision if and only if it satisfies\nthe following six postulates:\n\n\nClosure:\n\n\\(K* p = \\Cn(K* p)\\)\n\nSuccess:\n\n\\(p \\in K* p\\)\n\nInclusion:\n\n\\(K* p \\subseteq K+p\\)\n\nVacuity:\n\nIf \\(\\neg p \\not\\in K\\), then \\(K* p = K+p\\).\n\nConsistency:\n\n\\(K* p\\) is consistent if \\(p\\) is consistent.\n\nExtensionality:\n\nIf \\((p \\leftrightarrow q) \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(K* p = K*\nq\\).\n\n\nThese six postulates are commonly called the basic G\u00e4rdenfors\npostulates for revision. The most controversial of them is\nSuccess. It implies that in response to an inconsistent input\nsentence, the epistemic agent will acquire an inconsistent belief set,\naccording to which she holds all sentences to be true. Even for\nconsistent input sentences, Success is contestable. It is not\nimplausible for an epistemic agent to consider some statements to be\nso implausible that nothing can make her believe in them. For belief\nrevision models that do not satisfy Success, see section 6.3. and\n6.4.\n\nThe following two supplementary postulates are parts of the standard\nrepertoire:\n\n\nSuperexpansion:\n\n\\(K* (p \\amp q) \\subseteq(K* p)+q\\)\n\nSubexpansion:\n\nIf \\(\\neg q \\not\\in \\Cn(K* p)\\), then \\((K* p)+q \\subseteq K* (p \\amp\nq)\\).\n\n\nThese postulates are closely related to the supplementary postulates\nfor contraction. Let \\(*\\) be the partial meet revision defined from\nthe partial meet contraction \\(\\div\\) via the Levi identity. Then\n\\(*\\) satisfies superexpansion if and only if \\(\\div\\) satisfies\nconjunctive overlap. Furthermore, \\(*\\) satisfies subexpansion if and\nonly if \\(\\div\\) satisfies conjunctive inclusion.\n\nThe following postulate was introduced by Hans Rott:\n\n\nDisjunctive factoring:\n\n\\(K* (p\\vee q) \\) is equal to one of \\(K* p\\), \\(K* q\\), and \\(K*\np\\cap K* q\\).\n\n\nRott showed that in the presence of the six basic AGM postulates, the\ntwo supplementary AGM postulates, Superexpansion and Subexpansion,\nboth hold if and only if Disjunctive factoring holds.\n4. Possible world modelling\n\nAlternative models of belief states can be constructed out of sets of\npossible worlds (Grove 1988). In logical parlance, by a possible\nworld is meant a maximal consistent subset of the language. By a\nproposition is meant a set of possible worlds. There is a\none-to-one correspondence between propositions and belief sets. Each\nbelief set can be represented by the proposition (set of possible\nworlds) that consists of those possible worlds that contain the belief\nset in question.\n\nFor any set \\(A\\) of sentences, let \\([A]\\) denote the set of possible\nworlds that contain \\(A\\) as a subset, and similarly for any sentence\n\\(p\\) let \\([p]\\) be the set of possible worlds that contain \\(p\\) as\nan element. If \\(A\\) is inconsistent, then \\([A] = \\varnothing\\).\nOtherwise, \\([A]\\) is a non-empty set of possible worlds. (It is\nassumed that \\(\\bigcap \\varnothing\\) is equal to the whole language.)\nIf \\(K\\) is a belief set, then \\(\\bigcap[K] = K\\).\n\nThe propositional account provides an intuitively clear picture of\nsome aspects of belief change. It is convenient to use a geometrical\nsurface to represent the set of possible worlds. In Diagram\n1, every point on the rectangle\u2019s surface represents a\npossible world. The circle marked \\([K]\\) represents those possible\nworlds in which all sentences in \\(K\\) are true, i.e., the set \\([K]\\)\nof possible worlds. The area marked \\([p]\\) represents those possible\nworlds in which the sentence \\(p\\) is true.\n\n\n\nDiagram 1. Revision of \\(K\\) by\n\\(p\\).\n\n\nIn Diagram 1, \\([K]\\) and \\([p]\\) have a non-empty\nintersection, which means that \\(K\\) is compatible with \\(p\\). The\nrevision of \\(K\\) by \\(p\\) is therefore not belief-contravening. Its\noutcome is obtained by giving up those elements of \\([K]\\) that are\nincompatible with \\(p\\). In other words, the result of revising\n\\([K]\\) by \\([p]\\) should be equal to \\([K]\\cap[p]\\).\n\nIf \\([K]\\) and \\([p]\\) do not intersect, then the outcome of the\nrevision must be sought outside of \\([K]\\), but it should nevertheless\nbe a subset of \\([p]\\). In general:\n\n\nThe outcome of revising \\([K]\\) by \\([p]\\) is a subset of \\([p]\\) that\nis\n\nnon-empty if \\([p]\\) is non-empty\nequal to \\([K]\\cap[p]\\) if \\([K]\\cap[p]\\) is non-empty\n\n\n\nThis simple rule for revision can be shown to correspond exactly\nto partial meet revision.\n\nThe revised belief state should not differ more from the original\nbelief state \\([K]\\) than what is motivated by \\([p]\\). This can be\nachieved by requiring that the outcome of revising \\([K]\\) by \\([p]\\)\nconsists of those elements of \\([p]\\) that are as close as possible to\n\\([K]\\). For that purpose, \\([K]\\) can be thought of as surrounded by\na system of concentric spheres (just as in David Lewis\u2019s account\nof counterfactual conditionals). Each sphere represents a degree of\ncloseness or similarity to \\([K]\\).\n\nIn this model, the outcome of revising \\([K]\\) by \\([p]\\) should be\nthe intersection of \\([p]\\) with the narrowest sphere around \\([K]\\)\nthat has a non-empty intersection with \\([p]\\), as in Diagram\n2. This construction was invented by Adam Grove (1988), who also\nproved that such sphere-based revision corresponds exactly to\ntransitively relational partial meet revision. It follows that it\nalso corresponds exactly to entrenchment-based revision.\n\n\n\nDiagram 2. Sphere-based revision of\n\\(K\\) by \\(p\\).\n\n\nPossible world models can also be used for contraction. In\ncontraction, a restriction on what worlds are \u201cpossible\u201d\n(compatible with the agent\u2019s beliefs) is removed. Thus, the set\nof possibilities is enlarged, so that the contraction of \\([K]\\) by\n\\([p]\\) will result in a superset of \\([K]\\). Furthermore, the new\npossibilities should be worlds in which \\(p\\) does not hold, i.e.,\nthey should be worlds in which \\(\\neg p\\) holds. In the limiting case\nwhen \\([K]\\) and \\([\\neg p]\\) have a non-empty intersection, no\nenlargement of \\([K]\\) is necessary to make \\(\\neg p\\) possible, and\nthe original belief state will therefore be unchanged. In summary,\ncontraction should be performed according to the following rule:\n\n\nThe outcome of contracting \\([K]\\) by \\([p]\\) is the union of \\([K]\\)\nand a subset of \\([\\neg p]\\) that is\n\nnon-empty if \\([\\neg p]\\) is non-empty\nequal to \\([K]\\cap[\\neg p]\\) if \\([K]\\cap[\\neg p]\\) is\nnon-empty\n\n\n\nBelief-contravening contraction is illustrated in Diagram 3.\nContraction performed according to this rule can be shown to\ncorrespond exactly to partial meet contraction. Furthermore,\nthe special case when the whole of \\([\\neg p]\\) is added to \\([K]\\)\ncorresponds exactly to full meet contraction. The other\nextreme case, when only one element of \\([\\neg p]\\) (a\n\u201cpoint\u201d on the surface) is added to \\([K]\\)\ncorresponds exactly to maxichoice contraction. Thus, in\nmaxichoice contraction by \\(p\\) only one possible way in which \\(p\\)\ncan be false \\((\\neg p\\) can be true) is added.\n\n\n\nDiagram 3. Contraction of \\(K\\) by\n\\(p\\).\n\n\nGrove\u2019s sphere systems can also be used for contraction. In\nsphere-based contraction by \\(p\\), those elements of \\([\\neg p]\\) are\nadded that belong to the closest sphere around \\([K]\\) that has a\nnon-empty intersection with \\([\\neg p]\\). The procedure is shown in\nDiagram 4. Sphere-based contraction corresponds exactly\nto transitively relational partial meet contraction.\n\n\n\nDiagram 4. Sphere-based contraction of\n\\(K\\) by \\(p\\).\n\n5. Belief bases\n5.1 Increased expressive power\n\nIn the approaches discussed above, all beliefs in the belief set are\ntreated equally in the sense that they are all taken seriously as\nbeliefs in their own right. However, due to logical closure the belief\nset contains many elements that are not really worth to be taken\nseriously. Hence, suppose that the belief set contains the sentence\n\\(p\\), \u201cShakespeare wrote Hamlet\u201d. Due to logical closure\nit then also contains the sentence \\(p \\vee q\\), \u201cEither\nShakespeare wrote Hamlet or Charles Dickens wrote Hamlet\u201d. The\nlatter sentence is a \u201cmere logical consequence\u201d that\nshould have no standing of its own.\n\nBelief bases have been introduced to capture this feature of the\nstructure of human beliefs. A belief base is a set of sentences that\nis not (except as a limiting case) closed under logical consequence.\nIts elements represent beliefs that are held independently of any\nother belief or set of beliefs. Those elements of the belief set that\nare not in the belief base are \u201cmerely derived\u201d, i.e.,\nthey have no independent standing. In this way, models employing\nbelief bases can be said to achieve a somewhat higher degree of\naffinity to natural-language doxastic reasoning than what seems to be\nachievable in models such as AGM that use belief sets as\nrepresentations of belief sets. (A still higher degree of affinity to\nnatural language can be obtained in models employing hyperintensional\nlogic; see Berto 2019.)\n\nIn belief base models, changes are performed on the belief base, which\nis not logically closed. The underlying intuition is that the merely\nderived beliefs are not worth retaining for their own sake. If one of\nthem loses the support that it had in basic beliefs, then it will be\nautomatically discarded.\n\nFor every belief base \\(A\\), there is a belief set \\(\\Cn(A)\\) that\nrepresents the beliefs held according to \\(A\\). On the other hand, one\nand the same belief set can be represented by different belief bases.\nIn this sense, belief bases have more expressive power than belief\nsets. As an example, the two belief bases \\(\\{p, q\\}\\) and \\(\\{p, p\n\\leftrightarrow q\\}\\) have the same logical closure. They are\ntherefore statically equivalent, in the sense of representing\nthe same beliefs. On the other hand, the following example shows that\nthey are not dynamically equivalent in the sense of behaving\nin the same way under operations of change. They can be taken to\nrepresent different ways of holding the same beliefs.\n\n\nLet \\(p\\) denote that the Liberal Party will support the proposal to\nsubsidize the steel industry, and let \\(q\\) denote that Ms. Smith, who\nis a liberal MP, will vote in favour of that proposal.\n\nAbe has the basic beliefs \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), whereas Bob has the basic\nbeliefs \\(p\\) and \\(p \\leftrightarrow q.\\) Thus, their beliefs (on the\nbelief set level) with respect to \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the same.\n\nBoth Abe and Bob receive and accept the information that \\(p\\) is\nwrong, and they both revise their belief states to include the new\nbelief that \\(\\neg p\\). After that, Abe has the basic beliefs \\(\\neg\np\\) and \\(q\\), whereas Bob has the basic beliefs \\(\\neg p\\) and \\(p\n\\leftrightarrow q\\). Now, their belief sets are no longer the same.\nAbe believes that \\(q\\) whereas Bob believes that \\(\\neg q\\).\n\n\n(In belief set models, cases like these are taken care of by assuming\nthat although Abe\u2019s and Bob\u2019s belief states are\nrepresented by the same belief set, this belief set is associated with\ndifferent selection mechanisms in the two cases. Abe has a selection\nmechanism that gives priority to \\(q\\) over \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\),\nwhereas Bob\u2019s selection mechanism has the opposite\npriorities.)\n\nThere is only one inconsistent belief set (logically closed\ninconsistent set), namely the whole language. On the other hand there\nare, in any non-trivial logic, many different inconsistent belief\nbases. Therefore, belief bases make it possible to distinguish between\ndifferent inconsistent belief states.\n\nIn belief revision theory it has mostly been taken for granted that\nbelief sets correspond to a coherentist epistemology, whereas belief\nbases represent foundationalism. However, the logical relationships\namong the elements of a logically closed set do not adequately\nrepresent epistemic coherence. Although coherentists typically claim\nthat all beliefs contribute to the justification of other\nbeliefs, they hardly mean this to apply to merely derived beliefs such\nas \u201ceither Paris or Rome is the capital of France\u201d, that\none believes only because one believes Paris to be the capital of\nFrance. Therefore, the distinction between operations on belief bases\nand operations on belief sets should not be equated with that between\nfoundationalism and coherentism.\n5.2 Belief base contraction\n\nPartial meet contraction, as defined in Section 2.1, is equally\napplicable to belief bases. Note that \\(A\\bot p\\) is the set of\nmaximal subsets of \\(A\\) that do not imply \\(p\\); it is not sufficient\nthat they do not contain \\(p\\). Hence  \n\n\\[\n\\{p, p \\amp q, p \\vee q, p \\leftrightarrow q\\} \\bot p = \\{\\{p \\vee q\\}, \\{p \\leftrightarrow q\\}\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nMost of the basic postulates for partial meet contraction on belief\nsets hold for belief bases as well. However, Recovery does not hold\nfor partial meet contraction of belief bases. This can be seen from\nthe following example (that is adopted from Isaac Levi (2004) who used\nit for other purposes:\n\n\nLet the belief set \\(K\\) include both a belief that the coin was\ntossed \\((c)\\) and a belief that it landed heads \\((h)\\). The\nepistemic agent wishes to consider whether, on the supposition that\nthe coin had been tossed, it would have landed heads. In order to do\nthat, it would seem reasonable to remove \\(c\\) from the belief set and\nthen reinsert it, i.e. to perform the series of operations \\(K\\div\nc+c\\).\n\n(1) If partial meet contraction is performed directly on the belief\nset, then it follows from Recovery that \\(h \\in K\\div c+c\\), i.e.\n\\(h\\) comes back with \\(c\\). This is contrary to reasonable\nintuitions.\n\n(2) If partial meet contraction is instead performed on a belief base\nfor \\(K\\), then recovery can be avoided. Let the belief base be\n\\(\\{p_1 ,\\ldots ,p_n, c, h\\}\\), where the background beliefs \\(p_1\n,\\ldots ,p_n\\) are unrelated to \\(c\\) and \\(h\\), whereas \\(h\\)\nlogically implies \\(c\\). Then \\(K = \\Cn(\\{p_1 ,\\ldots ,p_n, c, h\\})\\).\nSince \\(h\\) implies \\(c\\), it will have to go when \\(c\\) is removed,\nso that \\(K\\div c = \\Cn(\\{p_1 ,\\ldots ,p_n\\})\\). When \\(c\\) is\nreinserted, the outcome is \\((K\\div c)+c = \\Cn(\\{p_1 ,\\ldots ,p_n,\nc\\})\\) that does not contain \\(h\\), as desired.\n\n\nThe following representation theorem has been obtained for partial\nmeet contraction on belief bases (Hansson 1999). An operation \\(\\div\\)\nis a partial meet contraction for a set \\(A\\) if and only if it\nsatisfies the following four postulates:\n\n\nSuccess:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(A\\div\np)\\).\n\nInclusion:\n\n\\(A\\div p \\subseteq A\\)\n\nRelevance:\n\nIf \\(q \\in A\\) and \\(q \\not\\in A\\div p\\), then there is a set \\(A'\\)\nsuch that \\(A\\div p \\subseteq A' \\subseteq A\\) and that \\(p \\not\\in\n\\Cn(A')\\) but \\(p \\in \\Cn(A'\\cup \\{q\\})\\).\n\nUniformity:\n\nIf it holds for all subsets \\(A'\\) of \\(A\\) that \\(p \\in \\Cn(A')\\) if\nand only if \\(q \\in \\Cn(A')\\), then \\(A\\div p = A\\div q\\).\n\n\nThe Relevance postulate has much the same function as Recovery has for\nbelief sets, namely to prevent unnecessary losses of beliefs.\n\nAn alternative approach to contraction of belief bases has been\nproposed under the name kernel contraction. For any sentence\n\\(p\\), a \\(p\\)-kernel is a minimal \\(p\\)-implying set, i.e. a set that\nimplies \\(p\\) but has no proper subset that implies \\(p\\). A\ncontraction operation \\(\\div\\) can be based on the simple principle\nthat no \\(p\\)-kernel should be included in \\(A\\div p\\). This can be\nobtained with an incision function, a function that selects at least\none element from each \\(p\\)-kernel for removal. An operation that\nremoves exactly those elements that are selected for removal by an\nincision function is called a kernel contraction. It turns out that\nall partial meet contractions on belief bases are kernel contractions,\nbut some kernel contractions are not partial meet contractions. In\nother words, kernel contraction is a generalization of partial meet\ncontraction.\n5.3 Belief base revision\n\nThe operation of expansion for belief sets, \\(K+p = \\Cn(K\\cup\n\\{p\\})\\), was constructed to ensure that the outcome is logically\nclosed. This is not desirable for belief bases, and therefore\nexpansion on belief bases must be different from expansion on belief\nsets. For any belief base \\(A\\) and sentence \\(p,\\) \\(A +' p\\), the\n(non-closing) expansion of \\(A\\) by \\(p\\), is the\nset \\(A\\cup \\{p\\}\\).\n\nJust like the corresponding operations for belief sets, revision\noperations for belief bases can be constructed out of two\nsuboperations: expansion by \\(p\\) and contraction by \\(\\neg p\\).\nAccording to the Levi identity, \\((A* p = (A\\div \\neg p) +' p)\\), the\ncontractive suboperation should take place first. Alternatively, the\ntwo suboperations may take place in reverse order, \\(A* p = (A+'p)\n\\div \\neg p\\). This latter possibility does not exist for belief sets.\nIf \\(K\\cup \\{p\\}\\) is inconsistent, then \\(K+p\\) is always the same,\nnamely identical to the whole language, independently of the identity\nof \\(K\\) and of \\(p\\), so that all distinctions are lost. For belief\nbases, this limitation is not present, and thus there are two distinct\nways to obtain revision from contraction and expansion:\n\nInternal revision:\n\n\\(A * p = (A \\div \\neg p) +' p\\)\n\nExternal revision:\n\n\\(A * p = (A +' p) \\div \\neg p\\)\n\nIntuitively, external revision by \\(p\\) is revision with an\nintermediate inconsistent state in which both \\(p\\) and\n\\(\\neg p\\) are believed, whereas internal revision has an\nintermediate non-committed state in which neither \\(p\\) nor\n\\(\\neg p\\) is believed. External and internal revision differ in their\nlogical properties, and neither of them can be subsumed under the\nother.\n5.4 Connections between belief bases and belief sets\n\nA contraction on a belief base gives rise to a contraction on its\ncorresponding belief set. Let \\(A\\) be a belief base and \\(K =\n\\Cn(A)\\) its corresponding belief set. Furthermore, let \\(-\\) be a\ncontraction on \\(A\\). It gives rise to an operation \\(\\div\\) of\nbase-generated contraction on \\(K\\), such that for all\nsentences \\(p: K\\div p = \\Cn(A-p)\\). Base-generated contraction has\nbeen axiomatically characterized. An operation \\(\\div\\) on a\nconsistent belief set \\(K\\) is generated by an operation of partial\nmeet contraction for some finite base for \\(K\\) if and only if it\nsatisfies the following eight postulates:\n\nClosure:\n\n\\(K\\div p = \\Cn(K\\div p)\\)\n\nSuccess:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K\\div\np)\\).\n\nInclusion:\n\n\\(K\\div p \\subseteq K\\)\n\nVacuity:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K)\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\).\n\nExtensionality:\n\nIf \\(p\\leftrightarrow q \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\div\nq\\).\n\nFinitude:\n\nThere is a finite set \\(X\\) such that for every sentence \\(p\\),\n\\(K\\div p = \\Cn(X')\\) for some \\(X' \\subseteq X\\).\n\nSymmetry:\n\nIf it holds for all \\(r\\) that \\(K\\div r \\vdash p\\) if and only if\n\\(K\\div r \\vdash q\\), then \\(K\\div p = K\\div q\\).\n\nConservativity:\n\nIf \\(K\\div q\\) is not a subset of \\(K\\div p\\), then there is some\n\\(r\\) such that \\(K\\div p \\subseteq K\\div r \\not\\vdash p\\) and \\(K\\div\nr \\cup K\\div q \\vdash p\\).\n\nOperations of revision on a belief set can be base-generated in the\nsame sense as operations of contraction.\n6. Other operations\n\nThe AGM framework has been extended in many ways. Some of these\nextensions have introduced new types of operations in addition to the\nthree standard types in AGM, namely contraction, expansion, and\nrevision.\n6.1 Update\n\nThere are two types of reasons why the epistemic agent may wish to add\nnew information to the belief set. One is that she has received new\ninformation about the world, the other that the world has changed. It\nis common to reserve the term \u201crevision\u201d for the first of\nthese types, and use the term \u201cupdating\u201d for the second.\nThe logic of updating differs from that of revision. This can be seen\nfrom the following example:\n\n\nTo begin with, the agent knows that there is either a book on the\ntable \\((p)\\) or a magazine on the table \\((q)\\), but not both.\n\nCase 1: The agent is told that there is a book on the table. She\nconcludes that there is no magazine on the table. This is\nrevision.\n\nCase 2: The agent is told that after the first information was given,\na book has been put on the table. In this case she should not conclude\nthat there is no magazine on the table. This is updating.\n\n\nOne useful approach to updating is to assign time indices to the\nsentences, as proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992). Then the\nbelief set will not consist of sentences \\(p\\) but of pairs \\(\\langle\np,t_1\\rangle\\) of a sentence \\(p\\) and a point in time \\(t_1\\),\nsignifying that \\(p\\) holds at \\(t_1\\). In the book-and-magazine\nexample, let \\(t_1\\) denote the point in time that the first statement\nrefers to, and \\(t_2\\) the moment when the second information was\ngiven in Case 2. The original belief set contained the pair \\(\\langle\n\\neg(p\\leftrightarrow q),t_1\\rangle\\). (\\(\\neg(p\\leftrightarrow q)\\)\nis the exclusive disjunction of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).) Revision by \\(p\\)\ncan be represented by the incorporation of \\(\\langle p,t_1\\rangle\\),\nand updating by \\(p\\) by the incorporation of \\(\\langle p,t_2\\rangle\\)\ninto the belief set. It follows quite naturally that \\(\\langle \\neg\nq,t_1\\rangle\\) is implied by the revised belief set but not by the\nupdated belief set.\n6.2 Consolidation\n\nIf a belief base is inconsistent, then it can be made consistent by\nremoving enough of its more dispensable elements. This operation is\ncalled consolidation. The consolidation of a belief base \\(A\\) is\ndenoted \\(A!\\). A plausible way to perform consolidation is to\ncontract by falsum (contradiction), i.e. \\(A! = A\\div\\smbot\\).\n\nUnfortunately, this recipe for consolidation of inconsistent belief\nbases does not have a plausible counterpart for inconsistent belief\nsets. The reason is that since belief revision operates within\nclassical logic, there is only one inconsistent belief set. Once an\ninconsistent belief set has been obtained, all distinctions have been\nlost, and consolidation cannot restore them.\n6.3 Semi-revision\n\nBy non-prioritized belief change is meant a process in which new\ninformation is received, and weighed against old information, with no\nspecial priority assigned to the new information due to its novelty. A\n(modified) revision operation that operates in this way is called a\nsemi-revision. Semi-revision of \\(K\\) by a sentence \\(p\\) can be\ndenoted \\(K?p\\). A sentence \\(p\\) that contradicts previous beliefs is\naccepted only if it has more epistemic value than the original beliefs\nthat contradict it. In that case, enough of the previous sentences are\ndeleted to make the resulting set consistent. Otherwise, the input is\nitself rejected.\n\nOne way to construct semi-revision on a belief base \\(A\\) is to let it\nconsist of two suboperations:\n\n Expand \\(A\\) by \\(p\\).\n Restore consistency by giving up either \\(p\\) or some original\nbelief(s).\n\n\nThis amounts to defining semi-revision in terms of expansion and\nconsolidation: \n\n\\[\nA?p = (A +' p)!\n\\]\n\n\nThis identity cannot be used for belief sets. Since all inconsistent\nbelief sets are identical, an operation ? such that \\(K?p = (K+p)!\\)\nwill have the extremely implausible property that if \\(\\neg p_1 \\in\nK_1\\) and \\(\\neg p_2 \\in K_2\\), then \\(K_1 ?p_1 = K_2 ?p_2\\). However,\nother ways to perform semirevision on belief sets have been proposed,\nin particular, the following two-step process:\n\nDecide whether the input \\(p\\) should be accepted or\nrejected.\nIf \\(p\\) was accepted, revise by \\(p\\).\n\n\nA simple way to apply this recipe is David Makinson\u2019s (1997)\nscreened revision, in which there is a set \\(X\\) of potential\ncore beliefs that are immune to revision. The belief set \\(K\\) should\nbe revised by the input sentence \\(p\\) if \\(p\\) is consistent with the\nset \\(X\\cap K\\) of actual core beliefs, otherwise not. The second step\nof screened revision is a revision of \\(K\\) by \\(p\\), but with the\nrestriction that no element of \\(X\\cap K\\) is allowed to be\nremoved.\n\nAnother variant of the same recipe is called credibility-limited\nrevision. It is based on the assumption that some inputs are\naccepted, others not. Those that are accepted form the set C of\ncredible sentences. If \\(p \\in\\) C, then \\(K?p = K* p\\). Otherwise,\n\\(K?p = K\\). This construction can be further specified by choosing an\noperation of revision and assigning properties to the set C. A variety\nof such constructions have been investigated (Hansson et al.\n2001).\n6.4 Selective revision\n\nSelective revision is a generalization of semi-revision. In\nsemi-revision, the input information is either rejected or fully\naccepted. In selective revision, it is possible for only a part of the\ninput information to be accepted. An operation \\(\\circ\\) of selective\nrevision can be constructed from a standard revision operation \\(*\\)\nand a transformation function \\(f\\) from and to sentences:\n\n\\[\nK \\circ p = K * f(p)\n\\]\n\n\nIn the intended cases, \\(f(p)\\) does not contain any information that\nis not contained in \\(p\\). This is ensured if \\(f(p)\\) is a logical\nconsequence of \\(p\\). By adding further conditions on \\(f\\), various\nadditional properties can be obtained for the operation of selective\nrevision.\n6.5 Shielded contraction\n\nThe Success postulate of contraction requires that all\nnon-tautological beliefs are retractable. This is not a fully\nrealistic requirement, since actual agents are known to have beliefs\nof a non-logical nature that nothing can bring them to give up. In\nshielded contraction, some non-tautological beliefs cannot be given\nup; they are shielded from contraction. Shielded contraction can be\nbased on an ordinary contraction \\(\\div\\) and a set \\(R\\) of\nretractable sentences. If \\(p \\in R\\), then \\(K-p = K\\div p\\).\nOtherwise, \\(K-p = K\\).\n\nThis construction can be further specified by adding various\nrequirements on the structure of \\(R\\). Close connections have been\nshown to hold between shielded contraction and semi-revision.\n(Ferm\u00e9 and Hansson 2001)\n6.6 Replacement\n\nBy replacement is meant an operation that replaces one sentence by\nanother in a belief set. It is an operation with two variables, such\nthat \\([p/q]\\) replaces \\(p\\) by \\(q\\). Hence, \\(K[p/q]\\) is a belief\nset that contains \\(q\\) but not \\(p\\).\n\nReplacement aims both at the removal of a sentence \\(p\\) and the\naddition of a sentence \\(q\\). This amounts to two success conditions,\n\\(p \\not\\in K[p/q]\\) and \\(q \\in K[p/q]\\). However, these two\nconditions cannot both be satisfied without exception. First, just as\nfor belief contraction, an exception must be made from the first of\nthem in the case when \\(p\\) is a tautology and so cannot be removed.\nSecondly, the two conditions are not compatible in cases when \\(q\\)\nlogically implies \\(p\\). This can be dealt with by extending the\nexception that is provided for in the Success postulate for\ncontraction from cases when \\(p \\in \\Cn(\\varnothing)\\) to cases when\n\\(p \\in \\Cn(\\{q\\})\\). This gives rise to the following two success\nconditions:\n\n\nContractive success:\n\nIf \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(\\{q\\})\\), then \\(p \\not\\in \\Cn(K[p/q]\\)).\n\nRevision success:\n\n\\(q \\in K[p/q]\\)\n\n\nReplacement can be used as a kind of \u201cSheffer stroke\u201d for\nbelief revision, i.e. as an operation in terms of which the other\noperations can be defined. Contraction by \\(p\\) can be defined as\n\\(K[p/\\smtop]\\) and revision by \\(p\\) as \\(K[\\smbot/p]\\), where\n\\(\\smbot\\) is falsum and \\(\\smtop\\) is tautology. Provided that the\nunperformable suboperation of removing the tautology \\(\\smtop\\) is\ntreated as an empty suboperation, expansion by \\(p\\) can be defined as\n\\(K[\\smtop/p]\\).\n6.7 Merge\n\nIf the belief set \\(K\\) has a finite base, then it can be represented\nby a single sentence, namely the conjunction \\(k\\) of all the elements\nof its base. This means that the revision \\(K* p\\) of a belief set\n\\(K\\) by a sentence \\(p\\) can be replaced by a revision \\(k* p\\) of a\nsentence by another sentence. If this revision is non-prioritized, we\nmay treat \\(k\\) and \\(p\\) equally, so that \\(k* p = p* k\\). Such an\noperation can be described as the merging of two belief\nrepresentations. It can represent a process of conflict resolution\nthrough selective combination of information from two agents or\nsources. This operation can also be generalized to the merge of\nseveral elements, representing efforts to combine information from\nseveral agents or sources (Konieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez 2011).\n6.8 Multiple contraction and revision\n\nBy multiple contraction is meant the simultaneous contraction of more\nthan one sentence. Similarly, multiple revision is revision by more\nthan one sentence.\n\nThere are two major types of multiple contraction. In package\ncontraction, all elements of the input set are retracted: they\nhave to go in a package. In choice contraction it suffices to\nremove at least one of them. Hence, the success conditions for the two\ntypes of multiple contraction are as follows:\n\nPackage success:\n\nIf \\(B\\cap \\Cn(\\varnothing) = \\varnothing\\) then \\(B\\cap \\Cn(A\\div B)\n= \\varnothing\\)\n\nChoice success:\n\nIf \\(B\\) is not a subset of \\(\\Cn(\\varnothing)\\), then \\(B\\) is not a\nsubset of \\(\\Cn(A\\div B)\\).\n\nPartial meet contraction and kernel contraction can both be\ngeneralized fairly straight-forwardly to both package and choice\nvariants of multiple contraction.\n\nThe construction of package revision gives rise to an interesting\nextension of the notion of negation. The reason why contraction by\n\\(\\neg p\\) is performed as a suboperation of revision by \\(p\\) is that\n\\(p\\) can be consistently added to a set if and only if it does not\nimply \\(\\neg p\\). It turns out that (in a logic satisfying\ncompactness) a set \\(B\\) can be consistently added to another set if\nand only if this other set does not imply any element of the set\n\\(\\neg B\\), that is defined as follows:\n\nNegation of a set:\n\n\\(p \\in \\neg B\\) if and only if \\(p\\) is either a negation of an\nelement of \\(B\\cup \\{\\smtop\\}\\) or a disjunction of negations of\nelements of \\(B\\cup \\{\\smtop\\}\\). \n\nTherefore multiple revision can be defined from (package) multiple\ncontraction and expansion via a generalized Levi identity:\n\n\\[\n K* B = (K\\div \\neg B)+B\n\\]\n\n\nMost of the major AGM-related contraction operations have been\ngeneralized to multiple contraction: multiple partial meet contraction\n(Hansson 1989, Fuhrmann and Hansson 1994, Li 1998), multiple kernel\ncontraction (Ferm\u00e9 et al. 2003), multiple specified\nmeet contraction (Hansson 2010), and a multiple version of\nGrove\u2019s sphere system (Reis and Ferm\u00e9 2011, Ferm\u00e9\nand Reis 2012).\n6.9 Indeterministic belief change\n\nMost models of belief change are deterministic in the sense\nthat given a belief set and an input, the resulting belief set is\nwell-determined. There is no scope for chance in selecting the new\nbelief set. Clearly, this is not a realistic feature, but it makes the\nmodels much simpler and easier to handle, not least from a\ncomputational point of view. In indeterministic belief\nchange, the subjection of a specified belief set to a specified input\nhas more than one admissible outcome.\n\nIndeterministic operations can be constructed as sets of deterministic\noperations. Hence, given three revision operations \\(* , * '\\) and \\(*\n''\\) the set \\(\\{*\\), \\(* '\\), \\(*\n''\\)\\(\\}\\) can be used as an indeterministic\noperation. The success condition is simply: \n\n\\[\nK\\{* , * ', * ''\\}p \\in \\{K* p, K* 'p, K* ''p\\}\n\\]\n\n\nLindstr\u00f6m and Rabinowicz (1991) constructed indeterministic\ncontraction by giving up the assumption that epistemic entrenchment\nsatisfies connectedness. This resulted in Grove\u2019s sphere systems\nwith \u201cfallbacks\u201d that are not linearly ordered but still\nall include the original belief set. Fazio and Baldi (2021) have used\nindeterministic contraction in an investigation of algebraic\ncounterparts to both the AGM model and some closely related models of\nbelief change.\n6.10 Operations for an extended language\n\nBelief revision theory has been almost exclusively developed within\nthe framework of classical sentential (truth-functional) logic. The\ninclusion of non-truthfunctional expressions into the language has\ninteresting and indeed drastic effects. In particular, this applies to\nconditional sentences.\n\nMany types of conditional sentences, such as counterfactual\nconditionals, cannot be adequately expressed with truth-functional\nimplication (material implication). Several formal interpretations of\nconditional sentences have been proposed. One of them, namely the\nRamsey test, is particularly well suited to the formal\nframework of belief revision. It is based on a suggestion by F. P.\nRamsey that has been further developed by Robert Stalnaker and others\n(Stalnaker 1968). The basic idea is that \u201cif \\(p\\) then\n\\(q\\)\u201d is taken to be believed if and only if \\(q\\) would be\nbelieved after revising the present belief state by \\(p\\). Let\n\\(p\\Rightarrow q\\) denote \u201cif \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)\u201d, or more\nprecisely: \u201cif \\(p\\) were the case, then \\(q\\) would be the\ncase\u201d. In order to treat conditional statements on par with\nstatements about actual facts, they will have to be included in the\nbelief set, thus:\n\nThe Ramsey test:\n\n\\((p\\Rightarrow q) \\in K\\) if and only if \\(q \\in K* p\\). \n\nHowever, inclusion in the belief set of conditionals that satisfy the\nRamsey test will require radical changes in the logic of belief\nchange. As one example of this, contraction cannot then satisfy the\ninclusion postulate \\((K\\div p \\subseteq K)\\). The reason for this is\nthat contraction typically provides support for conditional sentences\nthat were not supported by the original belief state. This can be seen\nfrom the following example:\n\nIf I give up my belief that John is mentally retarded, then I gain\nsupport for the conditional sentence \u201cIf John has lived 30 years\nin London, then John understands the English language.\u201d \n\nA famous impossibility theorem by Peter G\u00e4rdenfors (1986, 1987)\nshows that the Ramsey test is incompatible with a set of plausible\npostulates for revision. Several solutions to the impossibility\ntheorem have been put forward. One option is to reject the Ramsey test\nas a criterion for the validity of conditional sentences (Rott 1986).\nAnother, proposed by Isaac Levi, is to accept the test as a criterion\nof validity but deny that such conditional sentences should be\nincluded in the belief set when they are valid (Levi 1988.\nArl\u00f3-Costa 1995. Arl\u00f3-Costa and Levi 1996). Several\nother proposals have been put forward. However, it is fair to say that\noperations of AGM-style belief change have not yet been constructed\nthat are generally recognized as able to deal adequately with\nconditional or modal sentences.\n6.11 Resource-bounded belief change\n\nThe AGM model and most related models of belief change assume highly\nidealized reasoners who have unlimited cognitive capacities. Harman\n(1986) developed a set of rationality principles for resource-bounded\nepistemic agents. Wassermann (1999), Alechina (2006), Doyle (2013) and\nothers have developed models of belief change for agents with limited\ncognitive capacities. The use of finite belief bases (section 5) can\nbe seen as a way to avoid the operations on infinite belief sets that\nare standard in AGM. Operations on infinite sets can require infinite\nresources, which makes such operations impossible for agents with\nfinite resources.\n6.12 Changes in the strength of beliefs\n\nAn operation of change can raise or lower the position of a sentence\nin the ordering without affecting the belief set (but affecting how\nthe belief state responds to new inputs). An operation of\nimprovement, as proposed by Konieczny and P\u00e9rez (2008)\nincreases the plausibility of a non-believed sentence \\(p\\) by moving\nsome of the \\(p\\)-worlds to a higher position in the preference\nordering of worlds. Even if such a change does not lead to \\(p\\)\nbecoming a belief, its acceptance in later, additional operations can\nbe facilitated. \n\nAn operation of change can be so constructed that it adjusts the\nposition of the input sentence in an ordering to be the same as that\nof a reference sentence. This means that two sentences have to be\nspecified in the input: the (input) sentence to be moved and the\n(reference) sentence indicating its new position. Hans Rott (2007,\nOther Internet Resources) called such operators two-dimensional. John\nCantwell (1997) classified them as raising or\nlowering, depending on the direction of change. (See also\nFerm\u00e9 and Rott 2004 and Rott 2009.)\n6.13 Changes in norms and preferences\n\nThere are close parallels between changes in norms and changes in\nbeliefs. In order to apply a norm system with conflicting norms to a\nparticular situation, some of the norms may have to be ignored. The\nproblem how to prioritize among conflicting norms is similar to the\nselection of sentences for removal in belief contraction (Hansson and\nMakinson 1997). The AGM model was in fact partly the outcome of\nattempts to formalize changes in norms rather than beliefs\n(Alchourr\u00f3n and Makinson 1981). In spite of this, authors who\napply the AGM model to norms have found it in need of rather extensive\nmodifications to make it suitable for that purpose. Hence, in their\nmodel of changes in legislation, Governatori and Rotolo (2010)\nintroduced an explicit representation of time in order to account for\nphenomena such as retroactivity.\n\nA model of changes in preferences can be obtained by replacing the\nstandard AGM language by sentences of the form \\(p \\ge q\\)\n(\u201c\\(p\\) is at least as good as \\(q\\)\u201d) and their\ntruth-functional combinations. The adoption of a new preference can\nthen take the form of revision by such a preference sentence. Partial\nmeet contraction can be used, but some modifications of the AGM model\nseem to be necessary in applications to preferences (Hansson 1995,\nLang and van der Torre 2008, Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff and Hansson 2009).\n7. Iterated change\n\nThe preceding sections have only dealt with changes of one and the\nsame belief set or belief base. This is clearly a severe limitation. A\nrealistic model of belief change should allow for repeated (iterated)\nchanges, such as \\(K\\div p\\div q* r* s\\div t\\ldots\\) In other words,\noperations are needed that can contract or revise any belief set\n(belief base) by any sentence. Such operations are called\nglobal, in contrast to local operations that are\ndefined only for a single specified set.\n\nAn obvious way to obtain a global operation of partial meet\ncontraction would be to use the same selection function for all\nsets to be contracted. However, with the standard way to obtain a\npartial meet contraction from a selection function, this is not\npossible, due to the way selection functions treat the empty set. The\nway selection functions have traditionally been defined, if \\(A\\bot p\n= \\varnothing\\), then \\(\\gamma(A\\bot p ) = \\{A\\}\\). As a consequence\nof this, if \\(\\gamma\\) is a selection function for \\(A\\), and \\(A \\ne\nB\\), then \\(\\gamma\\) is not a selection function for \\(B\\). For let\n\\(A\\bot p = B\\bot p = \\varnothing\\). For \\(\\gamma\\) to be a function\nit must be the case that \\(\\gamma(A\\bot p) = \\gamma(B\\bot p)\\). For\n\\(\\gamma\\) to be a selection function for \\(A\\) it must be case that\n\\(\\gamma(A\\bot p) = \\{A\\}\\), and in order for it to be a selection\nfunction for \\(B\\) it must be the case that \\(\\gamma(B\\bot p) =\n\\{B\\}\\). Since \\(A \\ne B\\), this is impossible.\n\nThis can be solved if we rewrite the definition of partial meet\ncontraction as follows:\n\n\nAlternative definition of partial meet contraction:\n\n\\((1')\\) \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) \\subseteq K\\bot p\\), and if \\(K\\bot p \\ne\n\\varnothing\\), then \\(\\gamma(K\\bot p) \\ne \\varnothing\\).\n\n\\((2')\\) \\(K\\div p = \\bigcap \\gamma(K\\bot p)\\), unless \\(\\gamma(K\\bot\np) = \\varnothing\\), in which case \\(K\\div p = K\\).\n\n\nAs applied to a single belief set \\(K\\), this definition is equivalent\nwith the original definition. Notably, it yields the same result as\nthe original definition even in the limiting case when \\(p\\) is a\ntautology, but it avoids using the selection function in this limiting\ncase. With this, slightly adjusted, definition, one and the same\nselection function can be used for all belief sets, and consequently\nwe can construct iterated change using only one, AGM-style, selection\nfunction. Since partial meet revision is definable from partial meet\ncontraction via the Levi identity, this means that we have global\noperations for both contraction and revision. This construction is so\ngeneral that it does not impose any new properties on contraction or\nrevision, i.e. no properties in addition to the usual AGM postulates\n(Hansson 2012). \n\nHowever, most of the discussion on iterated change has been based on\nthe assumption that such additional properties are plausible and\nindeed desirable. The so-called Darwiche-Pearl postulates for revision\nhave had a central role in these discussions (Darwiche and Pearl\n1997):\n\n\nIf \\(q \\vdash p\\), then \\((K * p) * q = K * q\\). (DP1)\n\nIf \\(q \\vdash \\neg p\\), then \\((K * p) * q = K * q\\). (DP2)\n\nIf \\(K * q \\vdash p\\), then \\((K * p) * q \\vdash p\\). (DP3)\n\nIf \\(K * q\\) \u22ac \\(\\neg p\\), then \\((K * p) * q\\) \u22ac \\(\\neg\np\\) (DP4) \n\n\nThe Darwiche-Pearl postulates express an intuition about the epistemic\nordering of possible worlds, namely that when we revise by a sentence\n\\(p\\), then the ordering among \\(p\\)-worlds should be unchanged, and\nso should the ordering among \\(\\neg p\\)-worlds. The change takes the\nform of a shift of the relative positions of these two parts of the\noriginal ordering of worlds. A large number of proposals for such\nshifts have been put forward, but opinions differ widely on the\nadequacy of these proposals.\n\nAbhaya Nayak (1994) has proposed a model of iterated belief change in\nwhich both the belief states and the inputs are binary relations that\nsatisfy the standard entrenchment postulates except Minimality. Inputs\nof this type may be seen as \u201cfragments\u201d of belief states,\nto be incorporated into the previous belief state. In the same vein,\nEduardo Ferm\u00e9 and Hans Rott (2004) have investigated belief\nrevision with inputs of the more general form: \u201caccept \\(q\\)\nwith a degree of plausibility that at least equals that of\n\\(p\\)\u201d. They call this revision by comparison. Belief\nstates are represented by entrenchment orderings. Hence, from an\nentrenchment ordering \\(\\le\\) and such a generalized input a new\nentrenchment ordering \\(\\le '\\) is obtained that contains the\ninformation needed to construct the new belief set. \n8. Alternative accounts\n\nIn spite of the dominant position of the AGM model and its close\nvariants, several other formal models of belief changes have been\nproposed.\n8.1 Learning theory\n\nIn belief revision theory, the focus is on consistency rather than\ntruthfulness. In contrast, learning theory is devoted to induction and\nthe attainment of true beliefs. A research question is represented as\na partition of the set of possible worlds, i.e. a distribution of all\npossible worlds into non-overlapping sets. The research question has\nbeen fully answered when it is known which of these partitions\ncontains the actual world. Information received by the agent\nsuccessively narrows down the set of partitions that may contain it.\nThe central issue is how to construct an inductive strategy, i.e. a\nstrategy for which investigations to perform and in what order, and\nhow to interpret them (Kelly 1999). Although this problem has\nconnections with belief revision, operations not satisfying the\nstandard AGM postulates have usually played a prominent role in the\ndiscussion. (Genin and Kelly 2019)\n8.2 Dynamic logics of belief change\n\nDynamic doxastic logic (DDL) was introduced by Krister Segerberg to\nrepresent an agent who has opinions about the external world and\nchanges these opinions upon receipt of new information. DDL makes use\nof epistemic modal operators of the type introduced by Hintikka\n(1962). The sentence \\(B_i p\\) denotes that the individual \\(i\\)\nbelieves that \\(p\\). When only one agent is under consideration, the\nsubscript can be deleted, and the operator \\(B\\) can be read \u201cit\nis believed that\u201d or \u201cthe agent believes that\u201d\n(Segerberg 1995, p. 536). \n\nThe formula \\(Bp\\) in DDL differs from the expression \\(p \\in K\\) of\nAGM in being a sentence in the same language as \\(p\\). This makes it\npossible to express in the object language that a sentence is\nbelieved. In this way, Segerberg attempted to develop belief revision\n\u201cas a generalization of ordinary Hintikka type doxastic\nlogic\u201d, whereas in contrast \u201cAGM is not really logic; it\nis a theory about theories\u201d (Segerberg 1999, p. 136). In the DDL\nframework it is possible to express beliefs about beliefs. The\nsentence \u201c\\(i\\) believes that \\(i\\) does not believe that\n\\(p\\)\u201d can be expressed as \\(B_i \\neg B_i p\\), whereas there is\nno way to express it in the AGM framework. \\(((p \\not\\in K_i) \\in\nK_i\\) is not a well-formed formula.)\n\nIn DDL, belief revision operations (expansion, revision, and\ncontraction) are expressed with dynamic modal operators, similar to\nthose used for program execution. (This element of DDL was present\nalso in previous publications by several authors. See Fuhrmann 1991;\nde Rijke 1994; van Benthem 1989 and 1995.) Segerberg used the\nfollowing notation:\n\n\n\\([\\div p]q\\)\n(\\(q\\) holds after contraction by \\(p)\\) \n\n\\([* p]q\\)\n(\\(q\\) holds after revision by \\(p)\\) \n\n\\([+ p]q\\)\n(\\(q\\) holds after expansion by \\(p)\\) \n\n\nThe combination of these two elements, belief operators and dynamic\noperators, results in a framework that differs from AGM in important\nways. (Leitgeb and Segerberg 2007, 169)\n\nLargely similar systems have been developed under the name of Dynamic\nEpistemic Logic, DEL (Plaza 1989; Baltag et al. 1998; van Ditmarsch et\nal. 2007; see the entry on\n dynamic-epistemic logic).\n A major difference between DDL and DEL is that the latter has mostly\nbeen studied in multiagent contexts. The most studied dynamics is that\nof the public announcement of some sentence (van Ditmarsch et al.\n2007). \n8.3 Descriptor revision\n\nDescriptor revision (Hansson 2017) is based on two major formal\nconstructions. One of them is a metalinguistic belief predicate\n\\(\\mathfrak{B}\\) that is applied to sentences of the object language.\n\\(\\mathfrak{B}p\\) denotes that the sentence \\(p\\) is believed, \\(\\neg\n\\mathfrak{B}p\\) that it is not believed, and \\(\\mathfrak{B}p\\vee\n\\mathfrak{B}q\\) that either \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) is believed. Such sentences\ncan be used to express the success conditions of belief change\noperations. Thus \\(\\mathfrak{B}p\\) is the success condition of\nrevision by \\(p\\), \\(\\neg \\mathfrak{B}p\\) that of contraction by \\(p\\)\nand \\(\\{\\neg \\mathfrak{B}p,\\neg \\mathfrak{B}q\\}\\) that of multiple\ncontraction by \\(\\{p,q\\}\\). Due to the versatility of descriptors we\nonly need one operation, denoted \\(\\circ\\). Hence, \\(K\\circ\n\\mathfrak{B}p\\) represents revision by \\(p\\) and \\(K \\circ \\neg\n\\mathfrak{B}p\\) contraction by \\(p\\). \n\nThe other major formal construction is a choice function (selection\nfunction) that operates directly on the set of potential outcomes of\nan operation. Hence, the operation \\(K \\circ \\mathfrak{B}p\\) is\nperformed by choosing one among the potential belief sets that contain\n\\(p\\) (presumably that which is most choiceworthy, or closest at\nhand). Operations based on these principles have been axiomatically\ncharacterized. Notably, the recovery postulate that creates problems\nin the AGM framework does not hold in the descriptor revision\nframework. The application of a choice function to potential belief\noutcomes is arguably more plausible than its application to possible\nworlds or remainders, since the latter two entities are logically\ninfinite (if the language is so), and therefore cognitively\ninaccessible.\n\nDescriptor revision makes it possible to investigate operations of\nchange more generally, and to discuss properties that can hold for\noperations with different types of the success conditions. Let \\(\n\\Psi\\) and \\( \\Xi\\) be descriptors, i.e. sets of sentences containing\nthe \\( \\mathfrak{B}\\) operator. Let \\(K \u22a9\\Psi\\) denote that\n\\(K\\) satisfies all the conditions in \\(\\Psi\\). Some examples of such\ngeneral properties of descriptor revision are:\n\nClosure:\n\n\\(K \\circ \\Psi = \\Cn(K \\circ \\Psi)\\)\n\nRelative success:\n\n\\(K \\circ \\Psi \u22a9 \\Psi\\) or \\( K \\circ \\Psi=K\\)\n\nRegularity:\n\nIf \\(K \\circ \\Xi \u22a9 \\Psi\\), then \\(K \\circ \\Psi \u22a9\n\\Psi\\)\n\nConfirmation:\n\nIf \\(K \u22a9\\Psi\\), then \\(K \\circ \\Psi=K)\\)\n\nCumulativity:\n\nIf \\(K \\circ \\Psi \u22a9\\Xi\\), then \\(K \\circ \\Psi = K \\circ\n(\\Psi\\cup\\Xi) \\)\n8.4 Bayesian models\n\nThe AGM model and other logical frameworks for belief revision are\nbased on a dichotomous approach to belief: either something is\nbelieved or it is not, in either case without any gradations. Beliefs\ncan be be more or less easily given up, and non-beliefs can be more or\nless easily turned into beliefs, but the very act of believing does\nnot admit of degrees. In contrast, probabilistic models of belief,\nusually based on some form of subjective Bayesianism, admit all\ndegrees between the strongest belief and the strongest disbelief.\nDichotomous and probabilistic models represent different features of\nbelief systems. It has proved to be difficult to construct a\nreasonably manageable model that covers both the logic-related and the\nprobabilistic properties of belief change. These difficulties are\nclosely connected with the lottery and preface paradoxes (Kyburg 1961;\nMakinson 1965).\n\nHowever, belief revision theory has turned out to be useful in dealing\nwith the problematic limiting case of conditional probabilities with a\ncondition that has probability zero. Insights from belief revision\ntheory have been used in the construction of non-standard models of\nprobabilities in which conditionalization can be performed also in\nthis limiting case (Makinson 2011). \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alchourr\u00f3n, C.E., P.
