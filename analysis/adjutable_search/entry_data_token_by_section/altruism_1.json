    "main_text": "What is altruism? || Mixed motives and pure altruism\n1.1 Mixed motives and pure altruism\n\nAltruistic acts include not only those undertaken in order to do good\nto others, but also those undertaken in order to avoid or prevent harm\nto them. Suppose, for example, someone drives her car extra cautiously\nbecause she sees that she is in an area where children are playing, and\nshe wants to insure that she injures no one. It would be appropriate to\nsay that her caution is altruistically motivated. She is not trying to\nmake those children better off, but she is being careful not to make\nthem worse off. She does this because she genuinely cares about them for\ntheir sake.\n\nFurthermore, altruistic acts need not involve self-sacrifice, and they\nremain altruistic even when they are performed from a mixture of\nmotives, some of which are self-interested. The driver in the\npreceding example may have plenty of time to get where she is going;\nslowing down and paying extra attention may not be contrary to her own\ngood. Even so, her act counts as altruistic if one of her\nmotives for being cautious is her concern for the children for their\nsake. She may also be aware that if she injures a child, she could be\npunished for reckless driving, which she of course wants to avoid for\nself-interested reasons. So, her caution is both altruistic and\nself-interested; it is not motivated by only one kind of reason. We\nshould not be confused by the fact that \u201cself-interested\u201d\nand \u201caltruistic\u201d are opposites. A single motive\ncannot be characterized in both ways; but a single act can be\nundertaken from both motives.\n\nIf someone performs an act entirely from altruistic motives\u2014if,\nthat is, self-interested motives are entirely absent\u2014we can\ndescribe her act as a case of \u201cpure\u201d altruism. We should\nbe careful to distinguish purely altruistic behavior from\nself-sacrificing behavior: the former involves no gain for oneself,\nwhereas the latter involves some loss. If someone has a theater ticket\nthat he cannot use because he is ill, and he calls the box office so\nthat the ticket can be used by someone else, that is a case of pure\naltruism, but it involves no sacrifice.\n",
