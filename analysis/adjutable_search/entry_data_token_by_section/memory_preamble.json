    "main_text": "\n\nMemory plays important roles in many areas of philosophy. It is vital\nto our knowledge of the world in general and of the personal past in\nparticular. It underwrites our identities as individuals and our ties\nto other people. Philosophical interest in memory thus dates back to\nantiquity and has remained prominent throughout the history of\nphilosophy (Aho 2014; Bloch 2014; Burnham 1888; Herrmann\n& Chaffinn 1988; Nikulin 2015). More recently,\nmemory has come to be recognized as a topic of major philosophical\nimportance in its own right, with the emergence of the philosophy of\nmemory as a distinct field of research (Bernecker &\nMichaelian 2017).\n\nMuch of the impetus for the emergence of the field was due to a trend,\nbeginning in the late 1990s, towards increased interdisciplinarity\namong philosophers working on memory (Hoerl &\nMcCormack 2001; Sutton 1998), a trend which reinvigorated and transformed\nolder philosophical debates by bringing them into contact with empirical and\ntheoretical developments in psychology and the sciences of memory more\nbroadly. To cite just two examples among the many discussed below,\nempirical research on the constructive character of remembering has\nintensified philosophical debates over the viability of the\ninfluential causal theory of memory (Robins 2016b) and the associated\nconcept of memory traces (De Brigard 2014b), while theoretical\nframeworks which situate remembering as a form of imaginative mental\ntime travel have lent new urgency to longstanding debates over the\nrelationship between memory and imagination (Debus 2014; Perrin\n& Michaelian 2017).\n\nThe interdisciplinary character of the field notwithstanding, the\nconcerns of philosophers of memory remain distinct from those of\nmemory researchers in other disciplines, and, while this entry\ndiscusses the latter where they are of direct philosophical relevance,\nits focus is squarely on the former. Given the roles played by memory\nin other areas, the philosophy of memory inevitably overlaps with many\nother fields of research. Three core areas of activity can\nnevertheless be discerned, with most researchers approaching memory\nfrom the perspectives of philosophy of mind, epistemology, or ethics.\nThe bulk of this entry\u2014sections\n2\u20138\u2014focuses on research\non memory from the perspective of philosophy of mind, often referred to\nas the metaphysics of memory (Bernecker 2008). There is\na separate entry on the \n  epistemology of memory, \nso this area is discussed only briefly here,\nin section 9. Key issues in the ethics of memory are reviewed in\nsection 10.\n",
