However, we need\nfurther clarification of what this claim amounts to, for there is an\nunderstanding of this claim that it may be open to a non-disjunctivist\nto accept as well. For example, the non-disjunctivist can accept that\nthe terms \u2018veridical perception\u2019 and\n\u2018hallucination\u2019 mark useful distinctions between\nperceptual experiences that may, in certain contexts, be of\nexplanatory significance. So the non-disjunctivist may agree that\nthere is a sense in which veridical perceptions and hallucinations can\nbe thought of as perceptual experiences of different kinds. For\nsimilar reasons the disjunctivist can agree that there is a sense in\nwhich veridical perceptions and hallucinations can be thought of as\nexperiences of the same kind. For disjunctivists do not in general\ndeny that veridical perceptions and hallucinations can\nhave anything in common.\n\n\nOne formulation of disjunctivism invokes the notion of a\nfundamental kind. (This formulation is principally due to\nMartin, but see also Snowdon 2005a, p. 136. For discussion of this\nformulation, see Logue 2013). According to this formulation, the\ndisjunctivist is committed to denying that veridical perceptions,\nillusions and hallucinations are conscious events of the same\nfundamental kind. The assumption here is that for mental\nevents, there is a most specific answer to the question, \u2018What is\nit?\u2019 that tells us what essentially the mental event is,\nand thereby specifies its fundamental kind. On this\nformulation, the disjunctivist is committed to denying that whatever\nfundamental kind of conscious event occurs when one is veridically\nperceiving the world, that kind of event can occur whether or not one\nis veridically perceiving. Let us call a view of this sort\nfundamental kind disjunctivism.\n\n\nWhile those who advocate this form of disjunctivism reject a common\nkind claim, namely the claim that veridical perceptions and\nhallucinations are mental events of the same fundamental kind,\nthey may allow that veridical perceptions and hallucinations have\nsomething in common. So they may allow that there is a kind K that\nveridical perceptions and hallucinations can both instantiate. However, what\nthey deny is that such a kind K is the fundamental kind of\nconscious event occurring when a subject veridically perceives the\nworld.\n\n\nNot all accept the metaphysical assumption that mental events (or\nstates) have a \u2018fundamental\u2019 kind. A disjunctive theory of\nperception is often adopted in defence of a particular account of\nveridical perception, such as na\u00efve realism, and Byrne and Logue\n(2008) question whether any controversial claim about fundamental kinds\nis needed in order to defend a na\u00efve realist view of veridical\nperception. They suggest that one may hold a na\u00efve realist view\naccording to which mind-independent objects, such as tables and trees,\nare constituents of the experience one has when one veridically\nperceives the world, without being committed to a further claim about\nwhat the essence of such episodes consists in. They also note\nthat na\u00efve realism is often motivated by phenomenological\nconsiderations, and they question whether introspective reflection on\nthe phenomenology of the experience one has when one veridically\nperceives the world puts one in a position to learn anything about the\nessence of the experience one is having.\n2.1.2 The \u2018Distinct Mental Feature\u2019 Formulation\n\n\nThose who reject the metaphysical assumption that mental events (or\nstates) have a \u2018fundamental\u2019 kind may instead formulate\ntheir disjunctivist stance in terms of the claim that the differences\nbetween the kind of mental event that occurs when one veridically\nperceives the world and the kind of mental event that occurs when one\nhallucinates are due to differences in mental features of\nthe events in question. The thought here is that the fact that there\nis a respect in which two mental events (or states) are different may\nnot be due to the fact that they differ in some mental respect, and\nwhile we might type mental events and states in a variety of different\nways, for a variety of different purposes, we can distinguish a way of\nclassifying such events and states that focuses solely on their mental\nfeatures. For example, although there may be a context in which it\nsuits our purposes to group together the beliefs of a subject that are\ntrue, it is not generally thought that a belief\u2019s being true is a\nmental feature of that state.\n\n\nAccording to this alternative way of formulating disjunctivism, the\ndisjunctivist holds that veridical perceptions and hallucinations\ndiffer mentally in some significant respect\u2014i.e., there are\ncertain mental features that veridical perceptions have that\nhallucinations cannot have. So the disjunctivist rejects the claim\nthat the differences between a case of veridical perception and a case\nof hallucination can simply be due to differences in the extra-mental\nstates of affairs that obtain in those situations. Note, however, that\nthis formulation of the disjunctivist commitment leaves open the\npossibility that veridical perceptions and hallucinations can have at\nleast some mental features in common. (See Logue 2012a, 2013,\nand 2014.) There is a sense, then, in which it thereby leaves open the\npossibility that there can be a common mental element to veridical\nperception and hallucination.\n2.1.3 The \u2018No-Common-Mental-Element\u2019 Formulation\n\n\nByrne and Logue (2008) propose that the label \u2018metaphysical\ndisjunctivism\u2019 be reserved for an account of perceptual\nexperience that commits to the claim there is\nno common mental element to veridical perception and\nhallucination. According to Byrne and Logue, those who deny that veridical\nperceptions and hallucinations are mental events of the same\nfundamental kind (see section 2.1) are not thereby\ncommitted to \u2018metaphysical disjunctivism\u2019, as\nByrne and Logue use this label. For as they point out, those who reject\nthe claim that veridical perceptions and hallucinations are mental\nevents of the same fundamental kind need not deny that there is a\ncommon mental element to veridical perception and hallucination. So it\nis worth bearing in mind the particular use to which Byrne and Logue\nput the label \u2018metaphysical disjunctivism\u2019, as others would\nnaturally characterise fundamental kind disjunctivism as a metaphysical\ndisjunctivist thesis.\n\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, the issue of how precisely to formulate a\ndistinctively disjunctivist commitment is not\nuncontroversial.  For now we can at least say that the minimal\ncommitment of a view that can be labelled a disjunctivist theory of\nperception is that veridical perceptions and hallucinations differ\nmentally in some significant respect\u2014i.e., there are certain\nmental features that veridical perceptions have that hallucinations\ncannot have. So we can mark some of the differences between views that\nfall under the disjunctivist label by invoking the notion of\n\u2018disjunctivism about X\u2019, where X is the\nrelevant mental feature that it is claimed differs in cases of\nveridical perception and hallucination. This procedure is adopted in\nthe following two sections. If the disjunctivist about X\nmakes the additional claim that the particular mental\nfeature, X, that is unique to the case of veridical\nperception is essential to the fundamental kind of mental event it is,\nthen they will also be a fundamental kind disjunctivist. Furthermore,\nif they deny that there is a common mental element to veridical\nperception and hallucination they will satisfy the\n\u2018no-common-mental-element\u2019 formulation of disjunctivism.\n",
