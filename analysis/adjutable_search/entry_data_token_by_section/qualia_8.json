    "main_text": "Relational Theories of Qualia\n9. Relational Theories of Qualia\n\nRelational theories of qualia typically begin with the naive realist\nthesis that in normal circumstances perceivers are directly aware of\nthe objects around them and various properties that they have. It is\nthen proposed that since perceivers are also directly aware of what\ntheir experiences are like, the phenomenal character of their\nexperiences in such cases is to be understood in terms of the relevant\nobjects and their properties along with the viewpoint from which they\nare being observed. More precisely, it is urged that the phenomenal\ncharacter is constituted by the objects that the perceiver sees, some\nof their properties and how they are arranged relative to the\nviewer.(Campbell 2002) \n\nIn later work, Campbell (2009) allows that the viewer\u2019s\n\u2018standpoint\u2019 needs to be factored into phenomenal\ncharacter too. The standpoint a perceiver occupies includes much more\nthan just the egocentric frame of the perceiver. It includes the sense\nmodality used to perceive, the time and place of the perceiving as\nwell as the distance from the perceived object, the orientation of the\nperceiver relative to the object, and the temporal dynamics of the\nexperience. Consciousness of an object, for Campbell, now consists in\na three-place relation between a perceiver, an object, and a\nstandpoint. With what exactly phenomenal character itself is to be\nidentified, on this proposal, is unclear. \n\nBill Brewer (2011) agrees with Campbell that a third relatum is needed\nin na\u00efve realist accounts of perceptual experience, where the\nthird relatum includes the sense modality of the experience, the\nspatio-temporal point of view, and other relevant circumstances of\nperception but he does not specify what exactly these circumstances\nare. William Fish (2009) takes a similar position, arguing that the\nthird element should include idiosyncracies of the perceiver\u2019s\nvisual system as well as attentional facts about the perceiver since\ntwo ordinary perceivers viewing the same object from the same position\nmay nonetheless differ in the character of their visual experiences,\ndepending upon how good their eyesight is (for example) and how they\ndistribute their attention.\n\nOf course, when one is (completely) hallucinating, there are no\nobjects that one sees. So, relationism cannot allow that the\nphenomenal character in this case is the same as in the veridical\ncase. Accordingly, relationists reject what was called in the last\nsection \u201cthe common kind assumption\u201d. One possible view\nconsistent with relationism is that in hallucinatory cases the\nphenomenal character is a matter of the representational content of\nthe experience, as is claimed on some versions of representationalism.\nAnother view, held by some relationists, is that there is nothing more\nto the phenomenal character of a hallucinatory experience \u2014 for\nexample, an experience of a red triangle \u2014 than its being\nindiscriminable or indistinguishable from a veridical experience of a\nred triangle (Martin 2004, Fish 2009). On this view, in giving a\nmental characterization of a hallucinatory experience, there is\nnothing more to be said than that it has a certain relational and\nepistemological property, namely that of being indiscriminable from\nthe relevant perceptual experience.\n\nSometimes relationists try to motivate their view by arguing that\nsince the seen objects are constituents of veridical visual\nexperiences and they are not in the case of hallucinatory experiences,\nthe experiences in the two cases must themselves be different.\nHowever, even if this is correct, it does not follow that they cannot\nshare the same phenomenal character. What follows is rather that if\nthey do share a common phenomenal character, then the conscious\nexperiences are not to be individuated (solely) by that phenomenal\ncharacter.\n\nOne problem facing Martin\u2019s relational account of hallucinatory\nphenomenal character is that of cognitively unsophisticated\nperceivers. Dogs can hallucinate but they lack the cognitive\nwherewithal to judge that their hallucinatory experiences of bones are\nthe same or different from their veridical experiences of squirrels.\nIn at least one clear sense of \u2018indiscriminable\u2019, then,\ntheir hallucinatory experiences of bones are indiscriminable to them\nfrom their veridical experiences of squirrels. But the phenomenal\ncharacter of these experiences is certainly different. (For a\ndiscussion of this problem and a response to it, see Martin 2004. For\ncriticisms, see Siegel 2009.)\n\nAnother problem for the relational view is that it cannot easily\nhandle cases of normal misperception, for example, the Muller-Lyer\nillusion. Campbell tells us that idiosyncrasies of the perceiver may\naffect phenomenal character, but he has no account to offer of cases\nin which something looks other than it is even to normal observers in\nnormal circumstances. Here the scene before the eyes fails to capture\nthe phenomenology. Brewer says that illusions are to be accounted for\nin terms of visually relevant similarities to paradigms of a kind of\nwhich the perceived object is not an instance. In the case of the\nMuller-Lyer, the paradigm is a pair of lines one longer and more\ndistant than its plane, the other shorter and less distant. This\nproposal encounters various potential difficulties (Pautz 2010). For\nexample, in the waterfall illusion, the water appears to be moving and\nnot moving at the same time. Here there are no suitable paradigms in\nthe real world. (See the entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception.)\n \n",
