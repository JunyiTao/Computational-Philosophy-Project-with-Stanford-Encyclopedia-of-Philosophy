    "main_text": "William James\u2019s Will to Believe Argument\n3. William James\u2019s Will to Believe Argument\n\nThe argument presented by William James (1842\u20131910) in his 1896\nessay, \u201cThe Will to Believe\u201d, extends far beyond the issue\nof the rationality of theistic belief to include various philosophical\nissues (for instance, whether to embrace determinism or\nindeterminism), and even matters of practical life. James\u2019s\nargument, in its attack on the agnostic imperative (withhold belief\nwhenever the evidence is insufficient), makes the general\nepistemological point that:\n\na rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent me from\nacknowledging certain kinds of truth if those kinds of truth were\nreally there, would be an irrational rule. (James 1896, 28)\n\n\nWe might understand the agnostic imperative more fully as follows:\n\nfor all persons S and propositions p, if S\nbelieves that p is just as likely as not-p, then it\nis impermissible for S to believe either p or\nnot-p.\n\n\nIf James is correct, then the agnostic imperative is false.\n\nThe foil of James\u2019s essay was W.K. Clifford (1845\u201379).\nClifford argued that:\n\n\u2026if I let myself believe anything on insufficient evidence,\nthere may be no great harm done by the mere belief; it may be true\nafter all, or I may never have occasion to exhibit it in outward acts.\nBut I cannot help doing this great wrong towards Man, that I make\nmyself credulous. The danger to society is not merely that it should\nbelieve wrong things, though that is great enough; but that it should\nbecome credulous, and lose the habit of testing things and inquiring\ninto them; for then it must sink back into savagery. (Clifford 1879,\n185\u20136)\n\n\nClifford presented evidentialism as a rule of morality: \u201cit is\nwrong always, everywhere, and for any one, to believe anything upon\ninsufficient evidence\u201d (Clifford 1879, 186). If Clifford\u2019s\nRule of morality is correct, then any one who believes a proposition\nthat she does not take to be more likely than not, is, thereby,\nimmoral. It may be worthwhile to note that Clifford\u2019s argument\nhere is itself a moral pragmatic argument.\n\nJames has two main\u00a0concerns in the \u201cWill To Believe\u201d\nessay. The first is to argue that Clifford\u2019s Rule is irrational\n(James 1896: 28). The second is that a theistic commitment is\npermissible.\u00a0James contends that Clifford\u2019s Rule is but one\nintellectual strategy open to us. A proponent of Clifford\u2019s Rule\nadvises, in effect, that one should avoid error at all costs, and\nthereby risk the loss of certain truths. But another strategy is to\nseek truth by any means available, even at the risk of error. James\nchampions the latter via the main argument of the \u201cWill to\nBelieve\u201d essay. To facilitate matters eight definitions employed\nby James are paraphrased:\n\nHypothesis: something that may be believed.\nOption: a decision between two hypotheses.\nLiving option: a decision between two live\nhypotheses.\nLive hypothesis: something that is a real candidate for\nbelief. A hypothesis is live, we might say, for a person just in case\nthat person lacks compelling evidence disconfirming that hypothesis,\nand the hypothesis has an intuitive appeal for that person.\nMomentous option: the option may never again present\nitself, or the decision cannot be easily reversed, or something of\nimportance hangs on the choice. It is not a trivial matter.\nForced option: the decision cannot be avoided.\nGenuine option: one that\u2019s living, momentous, and\nforced.\nIntellectually open: neither the evidence nor arguments\nconclusively decide the issue.\n\n\nThe first main argument might be sketched as follows:\n\nTwo alternative intellectual strategies are available:\n\n\nStrategy A: Risk a loss of truth and a loss of a vital good for\nthe certainty of avoiding error.\nStrategy B: Risk error for a chance at truth and a vital\ngood.\n \nClifford\u2019s Rule embodies Strategy A. But,\nStrategy B is preferable to Strategy A because Strategy A would\ndeny us access to certain possible kinds of truth. And,\nAny intellectual strategy that denies access to possible truths is\nan inadequate strategy. Therefore,\nClifford\u2019s Rule is unacceptable.\n\n\nJames asserts that \u201cthere are\u2026cases where a fact cannot\ncome at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming\u201d\n(James 1896, 25). Among other examples James provides of this\nparticular kind of truth is that of social cooperation:\n\na social organism of any sort whatever, large or small, is what it is\nbecause each member proceeds to his own duty with a trust that the\nother members will simultaneously do theirs. Wherever a desired result\nis achieved by the co-operation of many independent persons, its\nexistence as a fact is a pure consequence of the precursive faith in\none another of those immediately concerned. (James 1896, 24)\n\n\nAnd if James is right that there is a kind of proposition that has as\na truth-maker its being believed, what we might call \u201cdependent\ntruths,\u201d then proposition (9) looks well supported.\n\nOf course, accepting proposition (11), and advancing an alternative\nstrategy of seeking truth by any available means, even at the risk of\nerror, does not entail that anything goes. And an important part of\nJames\u2019s essay restricts what legitimately might be believed in\nthe absence of adequate evidence. Among the requirements suggested by\nJames the most important is:\n\nOnly genuine options that are intellectually open are decidable on\npassional grounds.\n\n\nJames is not arguing against conforming one\u2019s belief to the\nevidence, whenever there\u2019s a preponderance of evidence. Nor is\nhe arguing against the importance of evidence. His is an argument\ncontra the prohibition of believing whenever the evidence is silent, a\nprohibition implied by Clifford\u2019s Rule.\n\nThe requirement that an option is intellectually open may be\nredundant. If the evidence were compelling, or even strongly\nsupportive of, say, hypothesis a, and you recognized this, it\nmay be that you would find only a alive. Since you\u2019re\naware that the evidence strongly supports it, you would not find\nnot-a living. In other words, to say that an option is living\nmay imply that it is intellectually open. Nonetheless, let\u2019s\nproceed as if aliveness and openness are logically distinct notions.\nAdditionally, we might ask whether the property of intellectual\nopenness is to be understood as the evidence is lacking, or as the\nevidence is in principle lacking. That is, is an option intellectually\nopen when the evidence is indeterminate, or when it is essentially\nindeterminate? James\u2019s argument requires only the former. The\nlack of adequate evidence is sufficient to render an option\nintellectually open. If more evidence appears so that one hypothesis\nis supported by a preponderance of the evidence, then a commitment to\nabide by the evidence is triggered.\n\nThe relevance of all of this to theistic belief, according to James,\nis that:\n\nReligion says essentially two things. \u2026the best things are the\nmore eternal things, the overlapping things, the things in the\nuniverse that throw the last stone, so to speak, and say the final\nword\u2026. The second affirmation of religion is that we are better\noff even now if we believe [religion\u2019s] first affirmation to be\ntrue\u2026 The more perfect and more eternal aspect of the universe\nis represented in our religions as having personal form. The universe\nis no longer a mere It to us, but a Thou\u2026. We\nfeel, too, as if the appeal of religion to us were made to our own\nactive good-will, as if evidence might be forever withheld from us\nunless we met the hypothesis half-way. (James 1896, 25\u20137)\n\n\nJames asserts that there are two affirmations of religion. By\naffirmation James means something like an abstract claim, devoid of\nmuch doctrinal content, and found in the major religions. The first\naffirmation is that the best things are the more eternal things, while\nthe second is that we are better off even now if we believe the first\naffirmation. The first affirmation is particularly puzzling, since\nJames does not assert that the best things are the eternal things; he\nsays that the best things are the more eternal things. He\nexplicates this affirmation with three metaphors and a slogan:\n\u201cthe overlapping things, the things in the universe that throw\nthe last stone, so to speak, and say the final word. \u2018Perfection\nis eternal,\u2019 \u2013 this phrase of Charles Secr\u00e9tan seems\na good way of putting this first affirmation of religion\u201d (James\n1896, 25). Two ideas are suggested by James\u2019s explication:\nsovereignty and perfection. If we understand \u201cmore\neternal\u201d as a kind of necessity, or non-contingency, then\nperhaps the first affirmation may be understood as asserting that the\nbest things are those things that cannot fail to be sovereign and\nperfect. This interpretation resolves much of the first\naffirmation\u2019s puzzle. The plurality though is still puzzling. We\ncan resolve this puzzle by recognizing that, although he does not\nexplicitly call it a third affirmation, James asserts that \u201cthe\nmore perfect and more eternal aspect of the universe is represented in\nour religions as having personal form. The universe is no longer a\nmere It to us, but a Thou\u201d (James 1896, 26).\nIf we take this as a third affirmation of religion (perhaps at the\nrisk a charge of theistic parochialism), the possibility that the more\neternal things are plural is foreclosed. Monotheism, in other words,\nand not polytheism is established by the third affirmation. Taken\ntogether, then, the first and the third affirmations of religion\nsuggest that the supreme good in the universe is the existence of a\npersonal being that is essentially perfect and sovereign. The second\naffirmation is that we are better off now by believing in the\nexistence of this perfect being. At least in part, we would be better\noff now by believing the first affirmation because by doing so the\npossibility of a relationship with this being is established.\n\nAccording to James, just as one is not likely to make friends if one\nis aloof, likewise one is not likely to become acquainted with the\nperfect being, if there is such, if one seeks that acquaintance only\nafter sufficient evidence has been gathered. There are possible\ntruths, James claims, belief of which is a necessary condition of\nobtaining evidence for them. Let\u2019s call the class of\npropositions whose evidence is restricted to those who first believe\n\u201crestricted propositions.\u201d Dependent propositions and\nrestricted propositions are James\u2019s counterexamples to\nClifford\u2019s Rule. They are two examples of the kinds of truths\nthat Clifford\u2019s Rule would keep one from acknowledging. That is,\nClifford\u2019s Rule is problematic because following it would\npreclude access to restricted propositions and dependent propositions.\nThe Cliffordian may be forever cut off from certain kinds of\ntruth.\n\nOne might object that James has at best shown that theistic belief is\nmomentous only if God exists. If God does not exist, and, as a\nconsequence, the vital good of eternal life does not obtain, then no\nvital good is at stake. To answer this objection a Jamesian might\nfocus on what James calls the second affirmation of religion \u2013 we\nare better off even now if we believe \u2013 and take that affirmation\nto include benefits that are available, via pro-belief, even if God\ndoes not exist. In The Varieties of Religious Experience\nJames suggests that religious belief produces certain psychological\nbenefits:\n\nA new zest which adds itself like a gift to life, and takes the form\neither of lyrical enchantment or of appeal to earnestness and\nheroism\u2026. An assurance of safety and a temper of peace, and, in\nrelation to others, a preponderance of loving affections. (James 1902,\n475)\n\n\nIn any case, given that theism is intellectually open and that\nit\u2019s part of a genuine option, and given that there are vital\ngoods attached to theistic belief, James says, the hope that it is\ntrue is a sufficient reason to believe. In addition this objection is\neasily evaded if we revise the notion of a genuine option by removing\nthe requirement that an option is genuine only if momentous, although\nJames himself may have been loath to drop that requirement.\n\nJames\u2019s second main argument proceeds:\n\nThe decision whether to accept theism is a genuine option.\nAnd,\nTheism is intellectually open. And,\nThere are vital goods at stake in accepting theism. And,\nNo one is irrational or immoral in risking error for a chance at\ntruth and a vital good. So,\nOne may accept theism.\n\n\nWith this argument, James seeks to support the second of his two\nprimary concerns of his essay, that a religious commitment is\npermissible.\n\nAn objection commonly leveled against James\u2019s argument is that\n\u201cit constitutes an unrestricted license for wishful\nthinking\u2026 if our aim is to believe what is true, and not\nnecessarily what we like, James\u2019s universal permissiveness will\nnot help us\u201d (Hick 1990, 60). That is, hoping that a\nproposition is true is no reason to think that it is. A\nJamesian might contend that this objection is unfair. As we have\nnoted, James does not hold that the falsity of Clifford\u2019s Rule\nimplies that anything goes. Restricting the relevant permissibility\nclass to propositions that are intellectually open and part of a\ngenuine option provides ample protection against wishful thinking.\n\nA more significant objection contends that James\u2019s argument\nfails \u201cto show that one can have a sufficient moral reason for\nself-inducing an epistemically unsupported belief\u201d (Gale 1990,\n283). This objection contends that there is a weighty moral duty to\nproportion one\u2019s beliefs to the evidence, and that this duty\nflows from moral personhood \u2013 to be a morally responsible person\nrequires that one have good reasons for each of one\u2019s beliefs.\nBut to believe an epistemically unsupported proposition is to violate\nthis duty and is thus, in effect, a denial of one\u2019s own\n personhood.[5]\n Or think of it another way, as intellectual beings, we have the dual\ngoal of maximizing our stock of (significant) true beliefs and\nminimizing our stock of false ones. Clifford\u2019s Rule derives its\nmoral validity, one might contend, from that intellectual goal. And\nfrom Clifford\u2019s Rule flows our duty to believe only those\npropositions that enjoy adequate evidential support. James\u2019s\nargument would, if operative, thwart our intellectual goal by\npermitting us to violate Clifford\u2019s Rule. Can a morally and\nintellectually responsible person ever have a moral duty to believe a\nproposition that lacks adequate evidence, a duty that outweighs the\nalleged Cliffordian duty of believing only those propositions that\nenjoy adequate support? To answer this, let\u2019s employ what we\nmight call the \u201cET\u201d thought experiment. Suppose Clifford\nis abducted by very powerful and very smart extraterrestrials, which\noffer him a single chance of salvation for humankind \u2013 that he\nacquire and maintain belief in a proposition that lacks adequate\nevidential support, otherwise the destruction of humankind will\nresult. Clifford adroitly points out that no one can just will belief.\nThe ETs, devilish in their anticipation as well as their technology,\nprovide Clifford with a supply of doxastic-producing pills, which when\ningested produce the requisite belief for 24 hours. It\u2019s obvious\nthat Clifford would do no wrong by swallowing the pills and bringing\nabout a belief lacking adequate evidential\n support.[6]\n Moreover, since one is never irrational in doing one\u2019s moral\nduty, not only would Clifford not be immoral, he would not even be\nirrational in bringing about and maintaining belief in a proposition\nlacking adequate evidential support. As we mentioned earlier, given\nthe distinction between (A) having reason to think a certain\nproposition is true, and (B) having reason to induce a belief in that\nproposition, it may be that a particular proposition lacks sufficient\nevidential support, but that forming a belief in that proposition is\nthe rational action to perform.\n\nA very interesting objection to James\u2019s argument is that it\nfalls prey to the very principle it invokes against Clifford:\n\nJames writes: \u201cA rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent\nme from acknowledging certain kinds of truth if those kinds of truth\nwere really there would be an irrational rule\u201d. This may sound\nlike sweet reason itself, but a moment\u2019s reflection should\nconvince us that it is nothing of the kind. Any rule whatever that\nrestricts belief in any way might conceivably shut us off from some\ntruths. (Wood 2002, 24)\n\n\nAccording to James, Clifford\u2019s Rule is problematic because, if\nfollowed, it would preclude access to restricted propositions and\ndependent propositions. According to this objection, this alleged flaw\nof Clifford\u2019s Rule is true of any epistemic principle. Every\nepistemic principle that divides beliefs into those that are\npermissible and those that are not runs the risk of shutting off\naccess to certain possible kinds of truth. James\u2019s restriction\nof the permissible use of the passional nature only to when one faces\na genuine option that\u2019s intellectually open is just as guilty of\nthe alleged flaw as is Clifford\u2019s Rule. But an alleged flaw\nfound in every possibility is no flaw. Hence, James\u2019s objection\nto Clifford fails.\n\nThis objection is interesting since it is in one sense true.\nIt\u2019s obvious that any rule that restricts belief in any way\nmight shut us off from certain truths. Still, while interesting, this\nobjection is irrelevant. James\u2019s argument is not predicated on\nthe abstract proposition that \u201cany rule whatever that restricts\nbelief in any way might conceivably shut us off from some\ntruths.\u201d It is predicated on the principle that there are\ndependent propositions, and there are restricted propositions. His\nexamples of social trust, and acquiring friends, and of social\ncooperation are intended to make that clear. If theism were true, then\nit is very likely that there would be dependent propositions and\nrestricted propositions in that realm as well. Clifford\u2019s Rule\nwould preclude access to any restricted or dependent proposition,\nwhether religious or not. James is not arguing against conforming\none\u2019s belief to the evidence, whenever there\u2019s a\npreponderance of evidence. He is arguing against the prohibition of\nbelieving whenever the evidence is silent. Since James\u2019s\nargument specifies the irrationality of Clifford\u2019s Rule\u2019s\nexclusion of dependent and restricted propositions, and not just the\nabstract possibility of some kind of true belief or other being\nexcluded, it escapes this objection.\n\nWilliam Wainwright has argued that James\u2019s argument properly\nfits within an old Christian tradition, which asserts that:\n\nMature religious belief can, and perhaps should, be based on evidence\nbut\u2026 the evidence can be accurately assessed only by men and\nwomen who possess the proper moral and spiritual qualifications. This\nview was once a Christian commonplace; reason is capable of knowing\nGod on the basis of evidence \u2013 but only when one\u2019s cognitive\nfaculties are rightly disposed. (Wainwright 1995, 3).\n\n\nIf Wainwright is correct, then James\u2019s argument is not just a\npragmatic argument, but also an epistemic argument, since he is\narguing that one of the pragmatic benefits is a more reliable access\nto reality (see also the explication of James\u2019 argument via\ncontemporary epistemic utility theory in Pettigrew 2016). So, the\nchasm between the epistemic and the pragmatic is not unbridgeable,\nsince James\u2019s Will to Believe argument spans the gulf between\nthe pragmatic and the epistemic. Importantly, we should keep in mind\nthat whatever else it is, James\u2019s argument is, at least in part,\na pragmatic argument, and, moreover, James probably saw his argument\nas having a similar status as Pascal\u2019s Wager, since he offers a\npositive evaluation of the Wager, very often overlooked by\ncommentators, \u201cPascal\u2019s argument, instead of being\npowerless, then seems a regular clincher, and is the last stroke\nneeded to make our faith\u2026complete\u201d (James 1896, 11).\n",
