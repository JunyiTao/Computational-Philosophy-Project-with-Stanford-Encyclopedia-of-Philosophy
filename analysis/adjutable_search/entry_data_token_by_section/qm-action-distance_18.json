    "main_text": "The analysis of factorizability: implications for quantum non-locality || Non-separability, holism and action at a distance\n8.1 Non-separability, holism and action at a distance\n\n\nIt is frequently argued or maintained that violations of OI involve\nstate non-separability and/or some type of holism, whereas violations\nof PI involve action at a distance. For notable examples, Howard\n(1989) argues that spatiotemporal separability (see section 4.3)\nimplies OI, and accordingly a violation of it implies spatiotemporal\nnon-separability; Teller (1989) argues that particularism (see section\n4.3) implies OI, and thus a violation of it implies relational holism;\nand Jarrett (1984, 1989) argues that a violation of PI involves some\ntype of action at a distance. These views are controversial,\nhowever.\n\n\nFirst, as we have seen in section 5, in quantum theories the\nviolation of either of these conditions involves some type of\nnon-separability and/or holism.\n\n\nSecond, the explicit attempts to derive OI from separability or\nparticularism seem to rely (implicitly) on some locality conditions.\nMaudlin (1998, p. 98) and Berkovitz (1998a, section 6.1) argue that\nHoward's precise formulation of spatiotemporal separability embodies\nboth separability and locality conditions, and Berkovitz (1998a,\nsection 6.2) argues that Teller's derivation of OI from particularism\nimplicitly relies on locality conditions. Thus, the violation of OI\nper se does not imply non-separability or holism.\n\n\nThird, a factorizable model, i.e., model that satisfies OI, may be\nnon-separable (Berkovitz 1995b, section 6.5). Thus, OI cannot be simply\nidentified with separability.\n\n\nFourth, Howard's spatiotemporal separability condition (see section\n4.3) requires that states of composite systems be determined by the\nstates of their subsystems. In particular, spatiotemporal separability\nrequires that joint probabilities of outcomes be determined as some\nfunction of the single probabilities of these outcomes. Winsberg and\nFine (2003) object that as a separability condition, OI arbitrarily\nrestricts this function to be a product function. And they argue that\non a weakened formalization of separability, a violation of OI is\ncompatible with separability. Fogel (2004) agrees that Winsberg and\nFine's weakened formalization of separability is correct, but argues\nthat, when supplemented by a certain \u2018isotropy\u2019 condition,\nOI implies this weakened separability condition. Fogel believes that\nhis suggested \u2018isotropy\u2019 condition is very plausible, but,\nas he acknowledges, this condition involves a nontrivial measurement\n context-independence.[33]\n\n\nFifth, as the analysis in section 5 demonstrates, violations of OI\nmight involve action at a distance. Also, while the minimal Bohm\ntheory violates PI and arguably some modal interpretations do not, the\ntype of action at a distance they postulate, namely action* at a\ndistance (see section 5.2), is similar: In both cases, an earlier\nspin-measurement in (say) the L-wing does not induce any immediate\nchange in the intrinsic properties of the R-particle. The\nL-measurement only causes an immediate change in the dispositions of\nthe R-particle\u2014a change that may influence the behavior of the\nR-particle in future spin-measurements in the R-wing. But, this change\nof dispositions does not involve any change of local properties in the\nR-wing, as these dispositions are relational (rather than intrinsic)\nproperties of the R-particle. Furthermore, the action at a distance\npredicated by the minimal Bohm theory is weaker than the one\npredicated by orthodox collapse quantum mechanics and the GRW/Pearle\ncollapse models; for in contrast to the minimal Bohm theory, in these\ntheories the measurement on the L-particle induces a change in the\nintrinsic properties of the R-particle, independently of whether or\nnot the R-particle undergoes a measurement. Thus, if the R-particle\ncomes to possess (momentarily) a definite position, the EPR/B\nexperiment as described by these theories involves action at a\ndistance \u2014 a stronger kind of action than the action* at a\ndistance predicated by the minimal Bohm theory.\n",
