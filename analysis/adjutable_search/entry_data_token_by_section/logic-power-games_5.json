    "main_text": "Analyzing Power || Cooperative Games and Their Logic\n3.1 Cooperative Games and Their Logic\n\nThe description of the game given in a relational structure of the\nform \\((\\mathcal{N}, W, \\succeq, E)\\) is not enough to understand\nwhich exact outcome will be chosen in the end. For that we\nneed a solution concept, i.e., a mapping that associates to a game a\nset of outcomes of that game (Abdou & Keiding 1991). We here\nconsider the general setting of cooperative or\ncoalitional games, where \\(E: W \\rightarrow (2^N \\rightarrow\n2^{2^W})\\)is a (not necessarily playable) dynamic effectivity function\n(again, strictly speaking a dynamic effectivity function assigns a\ncoalitional game to each state/outcome).\n\nA number of solution concepts have been introduced for coalitional\ngames (see for instance Osborne & Rubinstein 1994, and Apt 2009\n(Other Internet Resources)). For the present purposes we are only\ngoing to discuss what is possibly the best-known: the core. The core\nis a collection of stable outcomes, i.e., outcomes for which no\ncoalition exists whose members are both able and willing to deviate\nfrom it. It can be seen as the set of outcomes to which there is\nno effective opposition (Abdou & Keiding 1991).\n\nFormally, given a relational structure \\(F=(\\mathcal{N}, W, \\succeq,\nE)\\), an outcome \\(w\\in W\\) is said to be stable (in\n\\(v\\)) if there is no coalition \\(C\\) and set of outcomes \\(X\\subseteq\nW\\) such that both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n\\(X \\in E_v(C)\\)\n\\(y \\in X\\) and \\(i\\in C\\) implies that \\(y \\succ_i w\\)\n\n\nIn words, an outcome is stable if there is no group of individuals\nthat can achieve an alternative that they all strictly prefer.\n\nThe core is the collection of all stable\noutcomes.\n\nExample 6. Consider the outcome 1M, which is the only\noutcome that Germany reckons acceptable. Germany, as already observed,\nhave an effectivity function of \\(E(\\{\\textrm{Germany}\\})=\\{W\\}\\) so,\non their own, are not able to turn their preference into an outcome.\nHowever, together with other Countries, they are able to do so.\nSuppose their allies are Belgium, France and The Netherlands. Is 1M\nthen a good outcome? If we look at the preferences of the\nother players in the coalition, i.e., Belgium, France, The\nNetherlands, we observe the following. Belgium had rather an outcome\nbetween 4M and 5M, France and The Netherlands exactly 5M. These\nCountries could get together and select 5M, which is an outcome that\nis acceptable to them. However the effectivity function of\n\\(\\{\\)Belgium, France, The Netherlands\\(\\}\\) is \\(E(\\{\\)Belgium,\nFrance, The Netherlands\\(\\})=\\{W\\}\\), which means that the three\nCountries are not enough to pass the 5M bill. But the coalition made\nby Belgium, France, Italy and The Netherlands would be. Notice\nmoreover that 5M is one of Italy\u2019s preferred outcomes. 5M is in\nfact the only stable outcome of the game: there is no coalition that\nis together willing and capable of deviating from it.\n\nModal logic can be used to represent the core, with\n\\(E_w(C)\\)interpreting \\([C]\\)as before. Consider first the\nformula \n\\[p \\rightarrow \\bigvee_{C\\subseteq N} [C]\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)\\]\n\n\nThis says that if \\(p\\) is true then members of some coalition can\nimprove upon some \\(p\\) world, which does not seem the right\nformula to express stability in logic. However we can prove the\nfollowing results, which utilizes the correspondence between the\nformula and a specific class of frames.\n\nLet \\(E\\) be an (outcome monotonic) effectivity function and let\n\\(\\succeq_i\\) be a weak linear order. Then: \n\\[(F,V'), w \\models p \\rightarrow \\bigvee_{C\\subseteq N} [C]\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)\\]\n\n\nholds at \\(w\\) for every \\(V'\\) if and only there exists a\n\\(C\\subseteq N\\) and \\(X \\in E_w(C)\\) such that, for all \\(i\\in C\\),\n\\(x\\in X\\) we have that \\(x \\succ_i w\\).\n\nSo the formula holds at \\(w\\) for every valuation if and only if \\(w\\)\ndoes not belong to the core. Clearly, if the formula is false at an\noutcome and some valuation, then this means that the outcome does\nbelong to the core.\n\nNotice that, since effectivity functions are outcome monotonic, if we\nhave that if \\(X \\in E_w(C)\\) and \n\\[X \\subseteq \\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C} \\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)^{(F,V')},\\]\n\n\nthen \n\\[\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C} \\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)^{(F,V')} \\in E_w(C).\\]\n\n\nAlso notice that the result above allows for the case of\n\n\\[\\emptyset=\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)^{M} \\in E_w(C),\\]\n\n\nwhich might be counterintuitive. Requiring \\(E\\) to have liveness\ntakes care of this.\n\nNotice also how we had to impose a universal quantification on the set\nof valuations. Without this explicit quantification, the formula would\nonly hold for one specific model, which would not be an appropriate\nsolution. If instead we are only interested in knowing whether\nthere exists some outcome that is stable or, conversely,\nwhether the core is empty, it is sufficient to require the formula\nabove to be valid. This would amount to say that no outcome\nis stable, i.e., that the core is empty.\n\n\nProposition 10. Let \\(F\\) be a frame with \\(E_w =\nE_v\\)for every \\(w,v \\in W\\). We have that \n\\[\\models_F p \\rightarrow \\bigvee_{C\\subseteq N} [C]\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)\\]\n\n\nif and only if no outcome in \\(F\\) belongs to the core.\n\n\nAgain, liveness would take care of the trivial case in which\n\n\\[\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i p\\right)^{(F,V)}=\\emptyset.\\]\n\n\nAn alternative approach is to identify each outcome with a name (or,\nin the language of hybrid logic, a nominal) in the language.\nThen we have the following.\n\n\nProposition 11. Let \\(w_k\\) an atomic proposition be\ntrue at outcome \\(w_k\\) and only at outcome \\(w_k\\). \n\\[(F,V), w_k \\models w_k \\rightarrow \\bigvee_{C\\subseteq N} [C]\\left(\\bigwedge_{i\\in C}\\Diamond^\\succ_i w_k\\right)\\]\n\n\nif and only if \\(w_k\\) does not belong to the core.\n\n\nYet another alternative is to have atoms for coalitional power\n(\u00c5gotnes, van der Hoek and Wooldridge 2009): \\((F,V), w \\models\np_C\\) iff \\(w \\in E_w(C)\\). Then:\n\n\nProposition 12. Let \\(w_k\\) an atomic proposition be\ntrue at outcome \\(w_k\\) and only at outcome \\(w_k\\). \n\\[((F,V), w \\models \\bigvee_{C \\subseteq N} \\diamond^\\succ p_C\\]\n\n\nif and only if \\(w\\) does not belong to the core in \\(E_w\\).\n\n\nEmptyness of the core of \\(E_w\\)can then furthermore be expressed\nusing the universal modality \\(A\\) from Section 2.1: \\((F,V), w\n\\models A(\\bigvee_{C \\subseteq N} \\diamond^\\succ p_C)\\).\n\nSo depending on the properties we are interested in, different\nextensions of basic modal logic combined with different forms of\nvalidity (at a world vs model vs frame) are best-suited to express\nthem.\n",
