What (Linguistic) Ambiguity Isn\u2019t\n\n\u2018Ambiguity\u2019, as used by philosophers of language and\nlinguists, refers to a more specific phenomenon than that of multiple permissible interpretations. Distinguishing\nambiguity from these related phenomenon can be a difficult and\ntendentious (and sometimes tedious!) affair. We will discuss testing for ambiguity below: for\nnow, we will try to isolate ambiguity by separating it from other\ntypical cases with which ambiguity is easily conflated.\n",
