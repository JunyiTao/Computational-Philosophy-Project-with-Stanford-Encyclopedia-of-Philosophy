    "main_text": "Introduction\n2. Introduction\n\n\nHannah Arendt was one of the seminal political thinkers of the\ntwentieth century. The power and originality of her thinking was\nevident in works such as The Origins of Totalitarianism,\nThe Human Condition, On Revolution and The Life\nof the Mind. In these works and in numerous essays she grappled\nwith the most crucial political events of her time, trying to grasp\ntheir meaning and historical import, and showing how they affected our\ncategories of moral and political judgment. What was required, in her\nview, was a new framework that could enable us to come to terms with\nthe twin horrors of the twentieth century, Nazism and Stalinism. She\nprovided such framework in her book on totalitarianism, and went on to\ndevelop a new set of philosophical categories that could illuminate\nthe human condition and provide a fresh perspective on the nature of\npolitical life.\n\n\nAlthough some of her works now belong to the classics of the Western\ntradition of political thought, she has always remained difficult to\nclassify. Her political philosophy cannot be characterized in terms of\nthe traditional categories of conservatism, liberalism, and socialism.\nNor can her thinking be assimilated to the recent revival of\ncommunitarian political thought, to be found, for example, in the\nwritings of A. MacIntyre, M. Sandel, C. Taylor and M. Walzer. Her name\nhas been invoked by a number of critics of the liberal tradition, on\nthe grounds that she presented a vision of politics that stood in\nopposition some key liberal principles. There are many strands of\nArendt\u2019s thought that could justify such a claim, in particular, her\ncritique of representative democracy, her stress on civic engagement\nand political deliberation, her separation of morality from politics,\nand her praise of the revolutionary tradition. However, it would be a\nmistake to view Arendt as an anti-liberal thinker. Arendt was in fact\na stern defender of constitutionalism and the rule of law, an advocate\nof fundamental human rights (among which she included not only the\nright to life, liberty, and freedom of expression, but also the right\nto action and to opinion), and a critic of all forms of political\ncommunity based on traditional ties and customs, as well as those\nbased on religious, ethnic, or racial identity.\n\n\nArendt\u2019s political thought cannot, in this sense, be identified either\nwith the liberal tradition or with the claims advanced by a number of\nits critics. Arendt did not conceive of politics as a means for the\nsatisfaction of individual preferences, nor as a way to integrate\nindividuals around a shared conception of the good. Her conception of\npolitics is based instead on the idea of active citizenship, that is,\non the value and importance of civic engagement and collective\ndeliberation about all matters affecting the political community. If\nthere is a tradition of thought with which Arendt can be identified,\nit is the classical tradition of civic republicanism originating in\nAristotle and embodied in the writings of Machiavelli, Montesquieu,\nJefferson, and Tocqueville. According to this tradition politics finds\nits authentic expression whenever citizens gather together in a public\nspace to deliberate and decide about matters of collective\nconcern. Political activity is valued not because it may lead to\nagreement or to a shared conception of the good, but because it\nenables each citizen to exercise his or her powers of agency, to\ndevelop the capacities for judgment and to attain by concerted action\nsome measure of political efficacy.\n\n\nIn what follows, we reconstruct Arendt\u2019s political philosophy\nalong four major themes: (1) her conception of modernity, (2) her\ntheory of action, (3) her theory of judgment, and (4) her conception\nof citizenship.\n",
