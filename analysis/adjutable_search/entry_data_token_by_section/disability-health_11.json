    "main_text": "Personal Relations, Family, and Disability || Peer Relationships: Friendship and Love\n3.2 Peer Relationships: Friendship and Love\n\nAt the heart of the negative portrayal of disability\u2019s impact on\ninterpersonal relationships is the presumed inequality imposed on the\nrelationship when one participant has a disability but others do not.\nThe type of inequality and its explanation are not always made\nexplicit. Does it result from the (perceived) inability of people with\ndisabilities to participate in activities that are important to some,\nmost, or all friendships? Or does it arise from the (perceived) need\non the part of the person with a disability for technological or human\nassistance to manage typical life tasks? Does it stem from a belief\nthat the person with a disability does not possess the social or\npsychological resources to prove a stimulating and rewarding friend?\n\n\nThe influence of a dichotomous conception of disability, that is, of a\nconception of disability as a personal attribute one either has or\nlacks, is evident even in the way questions about disability and\npersonal relationships are framed. In asking questions like \u201cAre\nrelationships between disabled and nondisabled people necessarily\nunequal?\u201d we tend to assume that disability is a categorical\ncharacteristic: that there is a distinct subset of the population that\nis disabled and everyone else is nondisabled. If, instead, we adopted\nthe human variation model of disability (see\n SEP entry on disability: definitions, models, experience),\n we could reframe such questions. That model conceives of an\nimpairment as an arbitrary range on the continuum of variation for a\nhuman attribute. Moreover, the model sees disability as an interaction\nbetween atypical functioning or embodiment and an unaccommodating\nenvironment. Consequently, it emphasizes that most people are\n\u201cdisabled\u201d in some particular physical or social context,\ninsofar as they have some atypical characteristic which fits poorly in\nthat context. The model also suggests that a disability, like an\nimpairment, ought to be considered as a graduated characteristic: just\nas there are degrees of functioning, there are degrees of fit between\nfunctioning-embodiment and social environment. \n\nOn this view, the question \u201cAre relationships between disabled\nand nondisabled people problematically unequal?\u201d would be better\nreformulated as \n\nIs there a positive correlation between the degree to which the\nparties to a relationship differ in overall level of disability, on\nthe one hand, and the degree of problematic interpersonal inequality,\non the other? \n\nAlthough this is largely an empirical question and cannot be answered\nby philosophical reflection alone, philosophy can clarify the concepts\nthat figure in the question: what is it to have a disability, what\nsorts of equality matter in valuable interpersonal relationships, and\nis there a reason, given what disability is and what sorts of equality\nmatter, to think ex ante that such a correlation would\nexist?\n\nOne reason having or acquiring a physical, intellectual, or emotional\ndisability lessens the chances that relationships will move beyond\nacquaintanceship is that the disability looms so large in the minds of\nthe nondisabled person (and perhaps the disabled person as well) that\nit obscures or eclipses other features on which an intimate\nrelationship can be solidly grounded. Most people do not yet see\ndisability as one among many characteristics with respect to which\nhumans can vary. In this way, one aspect of a person comes to dominate\nthe whole, an aspect of stigmatization that elsewhere we have\ndescribed as \u201csynecdoche\u201d (Asch and Wasserman 2005).\n",
