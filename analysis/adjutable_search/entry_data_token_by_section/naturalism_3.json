    "main_text": "Ontological Naturalism || Reductive and Non-Reductive Physicalism\n1.4 Reductive and Non-Reductive Physicalism\nIt will be worth being explicit about the way the causal closure\nprinciple supports physicalism. First we assume that mental causes\n(biological, social, \u2026) have physical effects. Then the causal\nclosure principle tells us that those physical effects have physical\ncauses. So, in order to avoid an unacceptable proliferation of causes\nfor those physical effects (no \u201csystematic\noverdetermination\u201d), we need to conclude that the mental\n(biological, social, \u2026) causes of those effects are not\nontologically separate from their physical causes.\nHowever, even if this general line of argument is accepted, there\nis room for differing views about exactly what its denial of\nontological separateness requires. Let us agree that causes are\n\u201cevents\u201d (or \u201cfacts\u201d) that involve\ninstantiations of \nproperties.[6]\n So, if some special cause is not\nontologically separate from some physical cause, the property\ninstantiations that it involves cannot themselves be ontologically\nseparate from the property instantiations involved in the physical\ncause. At this point, however, there are divergent views about how\ntight a constraint this imposes.\nOne school holds that it requires type-identity, the strict\nidentity of the relevant special properties with physical\nproperties. On the other side stand \u201cnon-reductive\u201d\nphysicalists, who hold that the causal efficacy of special causes will\nbe respected as long as the properties they involve are\n\u201crealized by\u201d physical properties, even if they are not\nreductively identified with them.\nType-identity is the most obvious way to ensure the\nnon-separateness of special and physical causes: if exactly the same\nproperties comprise the special and physical cause, the two causes\nwill themselves be fully identical. Still, type-identity is a very\nstrong doctrine. Type identity about thoughts, for example, would\nimply that the property of thinking about the square root of two is\nidentical with some physical property. And this seems highly\nimplausible. Even if all human beings with this thought must be\ndistinguished by some common physical property of their\nbrains\u2014which itself seems unlikely\u2014there remains the\nargument that other life-forms, or intelligent androids, will also be\nable to think about the square root of two, even though their brains\nmay share no significant physical properties with ours (Fodor 1974,\nBickle 2013).\nThis \u201cvariable realization\u201d argument has led many\nphilosophers to seek an alternative way of reconciling the efficacy of\nmental and other special causes with the causal closure thesis, one\nwhich does not require the strict identity of non-physical and\nphysical properties. The general idea of this \u201cnon-reductive\nphysicalism\u201d is to allow that instantiations of a given special\nproperty will always be grounded in or metaphysically determined by\ninstantiations of physical properties, but to add that these\n\u201crealizing\u201d physical properties might be different in\ndifferent cases. So, for example, any being who thinks about the\nsquare root of two will do so in virtue of instantiating some physical\nproperties, but these can be different physical properties in\ndifferent cases\u2014in one human being it may be one set of neural\narrangements, in another a different set, and in other life forms it\nmight involve nothing like neural properties at all.\nThere are various more detailed ways of filling out this idea of\nnon-reductive physicalism. A common feature is the requirement that\nspecial properties should metaphysically supervene on physical\nproperties, in the sense that any two beings who share the realizing\nphysical properties will necessarily share the same special\nproperties, even though the physical properties which so realize the\nspecial ones can be different in different beings. This arguably\nensures that nothing more is required for any specific instantiation\nof a special property than its physical realization\u2014even God\ncould not have created your brain states without thereby creating your\nfeelings\u2014yet avoids any reductive identification of special\nproperties with physical ones. (This is a rough sketch of the\nsupervenience formulation of physicalism. For more see Stoljar\n2015.)\nSome philosophers object that non-reductive physicalism does not in\nfact satisfy the original motivation for physicalism, on the grounds\nthat it does not really reconcile the efficacy of mental and other\nspecial causes with the causal closure thesis (Kim 1998, Robb and Heil\n2014: Section 6). According to non-reductive physicalism, special\nproperties are not type-identical with any strictly physical\nproperties, even though they supervene on them. And this then seems to\nimply that any given special cause will be distinct from the\nphysical cause that realizes it, since it involves the\ninstantiation of a different property. (The property of thinking about\nthe square root of two is definitely a different property from the\nneural property that realizes it in me, say, since another being could\nshare the former property without sharing the latter.)\nThe opponents of non-reductive physicalism then insist that this\ngives us an unacceptable proliferation of causes for the physical\neffects of special causes after all\u2014both the physical cause\nimplied by the causal closure thesis and the distinct special\ncause. In response, advocates of non-reductive physicalism respond\nthat there is nothing wrong with such an apparent duplication of\ncauses if it is also specified that the latter metaphysically\nsupervene on the former.\nThe issue here hinges on the acceptability of different kinds of\nsystematic overdetermination (Bennett 2003). All can agree that it\nwould be absurd if the physical effects of special causes always had\ntwo metaphysically independent causes. Plugging this into the causal\nclosure argument for physicalism, we can conclude that there can be\nno metaphysically independent non-physical causes (such as Cartesian\ndualist mental causes) for effects that already have full physical\ncauses. However, even if \u201cstrong overdetermination\u201d by\ntwo ontologically independent causes is so ruled out, this does not\nnecessarily preclude \u201cweak overdetermination\u201d by both a\nphysical cause and a metaphysically supervenient special cause.\nAdvocates of non-reductive physicalism argue that this kind of\noverdetermination is benign and consistent with the causal\nargument\u2019s denial of strong overdetermination, since now the\ntwo causes are not metaphysically distinct\u2014the special cause\nisn\u2019t genuinely additional to the physical cause (nothing more\nis needed for your feelings than your brain states).\n",
