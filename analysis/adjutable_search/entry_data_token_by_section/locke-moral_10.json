    "main_text": "Moral motivation 2: the righteousness of morality || Locke\u2019s ethics of belief\n4.1 Locke\u2019s ethics of belief\n\nLocke\u2019s emphasis can be explained by turning our attention to a view\nof human nature that lies at the root of Locke\u2019s account. Locke tends\nto be fairly pessimistic about the degree to which most humans\nappreciate the inherent righteousness of morality. In fact, Locke\nmaintains a fairly low opinion of the willingness of most people to\nactually take the time to appreciate the righteousness natural law.\nIf, he writes,\n\nwe will not in Civility allow too much Sincerity to the Professions of\nmost Men, but think their Actions to be Interpreters of their\nThoughts, we shall find, that they have no such internal\nVeneration for these Rules, nor so full a Perswasion of their\nCertainty and obligation. (Essay, 1.3.7)\n\n\nHumans are flawed in two respects, according to Locke: we can fail to\nacknowledge our obligations to natural law, and we can fail to comply\neven when these obligations are acknowledged.\n\nLocke\u2019s views regarding reason and intellectual duty can be\ncharacterized as an ethics of belief, according to which our rational\nabilities place a responsibility on each of us to examine the beliefs\nwe hold, and to be accountable for those things to which we assent.\nThis is particularly the case with respect to moral rules, themselves,\nwhich are the ultimate guidelines for a good human life. As Locke sees\nit, our capacities as rational agents are insufficiently realized in\nmany, if not most, cases. While the law of nature is knowable by\nreason for Locke, it is not innately known\u2014Locke does not mean\nto suggest, as many theologians of his day believed, that it\n\u201clies open in our hearts\u201d (Locke 1663\u201364, 89). This\nwould, he grants, be:\n\nan easy and very convenient way of knowing, and the human race would\nbe very well off if men were so fully informed and so endowed by\nnature that from birth they were in no doubt as to what is fitting and\nwhat is less so. (Locke 1663\u201364, 90)\n\n\nFor Locke, however, this is just not the case. It is clear, to him,\nthat most people do not understand their moral duty in any deep or\nrobust way. To really know one\u2019s moral duty is to be a moral agent,\nfor Locke\u2014moral knowledge is something gained, by the\nindividual, through rational discovery. Moral truths are attainable\nwith the proper use of reason:\n\nthere is some sort of truth to the knowledge of which man can attain\nby himself and without help of another, if he makes proper use of the\nfaculties he is endowed with by nature. (Locke 1693\u201394, 89)\n\n\nFor Locke, knowledge, properly-speaking, requires that the individual\nherself perceives the truth or falsity of any claim to which she\ngrants or withholds assent. An individual agent must perform the\nintellectual analysis and demonstration herself in order to truly know\nher moral duty. As it turns out, however, the greatest number of\npeople (particularly in Locke\u2019s day), are, he acknowledges\n\ngiven up to Labour, and enslaved to the Necessity of their mean\nCondition; whose lives are worn out, only in the Provisions of Living.\n(Essay, 4.20.2)\n\n\nFor these people, the opportunity for gaining a clear perception of\ntheir moral duty is very narrow. Worse than this, there are people who\nhave the means and the leisure, but \u201csatisfy themselves with a\nlazy ignorance\u201d (Essay, 4.20.6). These latter, Locke\nasserts, have a \u201clow Opinion of their Souls\u201d\n(Essay, 4.20.6). But, in neither case are people entirely off\nthe hook, according to Locke, who argues that no matter how busy one\nis, there should always be time for thinking about our souls and\nmatters of religion. If one fails to do this, then one is relying for\none\u2019s salvation and self-realization upon the mere current of opinion\nor the untrustworthy word of others. Locke asks if this can\nprovide\n\nsufficient Evidence and Security to every Man, to venture his greatest\nConcernments on; nay, his everlasting Happiness, or Misery.\n(Essay, 4.20.3)\n\n\nThe failure to do so is a kind of moral failing for Locke, one that\ngains its normative force from the teleogical imperative attending our\nrational natures:\n\nGod has furnished Men with Faculties sufficient to direct them in the\nWay they should take, if they will but seriously employ them that Way,\nwhen their ordinary Vocations allow them the Leisure. (Essay,\n4.20.3)\n\n\nAgain, Locke is not suggesting that we do this from considerations of\nrewards and punishments, but because it is the fulfillment of our\ndivinely-created natures. Despite failures to comply, the normative\nforce of morality is undeniable, for Locke, on these teleogical\ngrounds. Though Locke seems to believe that our failings with regards\nto moral knowledge result from a failure to engage our minds in the\nright direction, he does however acknowledge that the discovery of\nmoral truths is difficult and laborious. And this is where sanctions\ncome into play.\n",
