    "main_text": "\n\n\nMohism was an influential philosophical, social, and religious\nmovement that flourished during the Warring States era (479\u2013221\nBCE) in ancient China. Mohism originates in the teachings of Mo Di, or\n\u201cMozi\u201d (\u201cMaster Mo,\u201d fl. ca. 430 BCE), from\nwhom it takes its name.  Mozi and his followers initiated\nphilosophical argumentation and debate in China. They were the first\nin the tradition to engage, like Socrates in ancient Greece, in an\nexplicit, reflective search for objective moral standards and to give\nstep-by-step, tightly reasoned arguments for their views, though their\nreasoning is sometimes simplistic or rests on doubtful\nassumptions. They formulated China\u2019s first explicit ethical and\npolitical theories and advanced the world\u2019s earliest form of\nconsequentialism, a remarkably sophisticated version based on a\nplurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of collective human welfare.\nThe Mohists applied a pragmatic, non-representational theory of\nlanguage and knowledge and developed a rudimentary theory of\nanalogical argumentation. They played a key role in articulating and\nshaping many of the central concepts, assumptions, and issues of\nclassical Chinese philosophical discourse.\n\n\nA later branch of the school (see the entry on\n Mohist Canons)\n formulated a sophisticated semantic theory, epistemology,\nconsequentialist ethics, theory of analogical reasoning, and mereological\nontology and undertook inquiries in such diverse fields as geometry,\nmechanics, optics, and economics. They addressed technical problems\nraised by their semantics and consequentialist ethics and produced a\ncollection of terse, rigorous arguments that develop Mohist doctrines,\ndefend them against criticisms, and rebut opponents\u2019 views.\n\n\nCentral elements of Mohist thought include advocacy of a unified\nethical and political order grounded in a consequentialist ethic emphasizing\nimpartial concern for all; active opposition to military aggression and\ninjury to others; devotion to utility and frugality and condemnation of\nwaste and luxury; support for a centralized, authoritarian state led by\na virtuous, benevolent sovereign and managed by a hierarchical,\nmerit-based bureaucracy; and reverence for and obedience to Heaven\n(Tian, literally the sky) and the ghosts worshiped in\ntraditional folk religion. Mohist ethics and epistemology are\ncharacterized by a concern with finding objective standards that will\nguide judgment and action reliably and impartially so as to produce\nbeneficial, morally right consequences. The Mohists assume that people\nare naturally motivated to do what they believe is right, and thus with\nproper moral education will generally tend to conform to the correct\nethical norms. They believe strongly in the power of discussion and\npersuasion to solve ethical problems and motivate action, and they are\nconfident that moral and political questions have objective answers\nthat can be discovered and defended by inquiry.\n",
