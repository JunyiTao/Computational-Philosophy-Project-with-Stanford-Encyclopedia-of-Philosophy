Thermodynamics, the least action principle, and free energies: 1881\u20131887\n\nIn 1880, Helmholtz became the director of the Institute of Physics in\nBerlin. Between 1881 and 1884, Helmholtz attacked the question of how\nto integrate energy conservation and Maupertuis\u2019s principle of\nleast action to describe thermodynamic and chemical processes.\n\nOver the 19th century, the application of the least action principle\ndominated the approach of analytical dynamics to physical problems.\nLagrangian mechanics seeks to determine the trajectory of a system of\nparticles over time by solving Lagrangian equations for the system.\nThese equations are formulated using the least action principle. In\nthe Lagrangian formalism, a system of particles follows a path that\nminimizes the action over time. Lagrange\u2019s equations can be\napplied easily to systems of polar coordinates and of Cartesian\ncoordinates alike, a reason that the Lagrangian formalism was adopted\npreferentially over the 19th century.\n\nWhile the Lagrangian formalism is well adapted to evaluating\nmechanical systems of particles, it is not as well suited to\nevaluating some transfers of energy, which involve calculations over a\nvast multitude of molecules. The Hamiltonian formalism is better\nsuited to this task. The Hamiltonian equations also evaluate the\naction in a system, but use an integral sum of the momenta of the\nelements of the system. In the simplest case, the Lagrangian deals\nwith the velocity of a particle and the Hamiltonian with the momenta\nof the particle. The Hamiltonian gives a minimum value for a function\nover any path given the initial and end states of the action. Thus,\nthe Hamiltonian formalism yields the same result, namely the\nmathematical determination of the path taken by a system.\n\nThe Hamiltonian expression of the momenta of the system can be derived\nfrom the Lagrangian, and vice versa, using a Legendre transform. In\nfact, the Hamiltonian just is the Legendre transform of the\nLagrangian for any given system. The formalisms are equivalent, but\nthere are some situations, including evaluating heat transfer, in\nwhich the Hamiltonian is preferred.\n\nIn 1882, Helmholtz gave an address, \u201cThe Thermodynamics of\nChemical Processes,\u201d at the Berlin Academy. Up until\nHelmholtz\u2019s address, chemical reactions had been explained by\n\u201cchemical forces\u201d or \u201caffinities\u201d between\nchemical substances, measured quantitatively by the heat developed\nduring a chemical reaction. Gustave Coriolis had clarified the notion\nof work as the product of force over distance in 1821, and this notion\nwas in common use by the late 19th century. In his address, Helmholtz\n\u201cproved that affinity was not given by the heat evolved in a\nchemical reaction but rather by the maximum work produced when the\nreaction was carried out reversibly\u201d (Kragh 1993, 405). However,\nwhile kinetic and mechanical energy can be converted into heat in\nevery case, only in restricted cases can heat be converted into\nkinetic and mechanical energy. Hence, the equations describing\nchemical processes involving heat could not always be reversed. These\nare the conditions under which the Legendre transform could not be\napplied, and thus the Hamiltonian could not be determined for that\nsystem.\n\nIn particular, the equations for a system containing heat as a\nvariable contain entropy as a variable quantity. Entropy is an\ninconvenient variable, difficult to control for and hold constant as\none can hold temperature, pressure, and volume constant. The Legendre\ntransform allows a researcher to convert equations containing entropy\ninto equations expressed only in terms of temperature, pressure, and\nvolume. The Legendre transform can be applied correctly only under\ncertain conditions, which must be specified.\n\nHelmholtz proposed the notion of a \u201cfree energy\u201d to\naccount for cases involving heat and entropy. The Helmholtz free\nenergy is defined as F \u21d4 E \u2212 TS,\nwhere E is energy, T is temperature, and S\nis entropy. The free energy equation yields a quantity, F,\nthat is independent of heat and entropy. Many equations involving\nF and not T or S are fully reversible, and\nso Helmholtz\u2019s work allowed for the application of the\nHamiltonian to many chemical processes. Hence while \u201cHelmholtz\nwas neither the sole nor the most important contributor\u201d to\ntheoretical chemistry, \u201chis thermodynamic theory of\n1882\u20131883 was the pioneering work on which much of the new\ntheoretical chemistry rested\u201d (Kragh 1993, 406).\n\nFor discussions of the philosophical and scientific implications of\nHelmholtz\u2019s work in thermodynamics, see Kragh 1993 and Campisi\n2005.\n",
