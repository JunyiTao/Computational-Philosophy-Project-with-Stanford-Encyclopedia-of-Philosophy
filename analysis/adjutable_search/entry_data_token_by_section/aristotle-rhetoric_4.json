    "main_text": "The Nature and Purpose of Rhetoric || The Definition of Rhetoric\n4.1 The Definition of Rhetoric\n\nAssuming that Aristotle\u2019s Poetics gives instructions\nfor how to compose good tragedies, shouldn\u2019t we expect, then,\nthat Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is similarly meant to give\ninstructions for how to compose good speeches? And does this, by the\nsame token, render the art of rhetoric a sort of productive knowledge\naiming at the fabrication of a speech (similar to the way the art of\nshoemaking aims at the fabrication of shoes)? This sounds plausible,\nas far as it goes (for a discussion of this issue see Leff 1993), and\nin a few passages (especially in Rhet. III: e.g. 1415b35,\n1417a2, 1417a34f. and 36, 1418a10 and 12 and 39, 1420b1) Aristotle\nactually seems to directly address and instruct a speechwriter in the\nsecond person. However, these are rather exceptions to a broader\ntendency and it is striking that Aristotle never defines the art of\nrhetoric through the supposed product, the speech, nor the full\ncommand of the art of rhetoric through the perfection of the product,\ni.e. the excellent speech. Instead, Aristotle defines the rhetorician\nas someone who is always able to see what is persuasive\n(Topics VI.12, 149b25); correspondingly, rhetoric is defined\nas the ability to see what is possibly persuasive in every given case\n(Rhet. I.2, 1355b26f.). Indeed there are passages\n(Rhet. I.1, 1355b15\u201317) in which the persuasive plays\nthe same role in rhetoric as the conclusive plays in dialectic or\nlogic. This is not to say that it is the defining function\n(ergon) of rhetoric to persuade, for the rhetoricians (the\nones who possess the art of rhetoric) will not be able to convince\npeople under all circumstances (Rhet. I.1, 1355b10\u201314).\nRather they are in a situation similar to that of physicians: the\nlatter have a complete grasp of their art if and only if they neglect\nnothing that might heal their patients, although they are not expected\nto heal each and every patient. Similarly, rhetoricians have\na complete grasp of their method, if and only if they are capable of\nseeing the available means of persuasion, although they are certainly\nnot able to convince each and every audience \u2014 owing to\nfactors that the art of rhetoric cannot alter (e.g. biases,\npartisanship, stubbornness or corruption of the audience). In light of\nthis definition, it seems that the art (techn\u00ea) of\nrhetoric is primarily concerned with the nature and the ingredients of\npersuasiveness and that the book Rhetoric is primarily\nconcerned with elaborating the various ingredients of this art. It\ngoes without saying that possessing such an art is useful for the\ncomposition of speeches, but might also be useful for other purposes,\ne.g. for assessing other people\u2019s speeches, for analysing the\npersuasive potential of competing cases, etc.\n",
