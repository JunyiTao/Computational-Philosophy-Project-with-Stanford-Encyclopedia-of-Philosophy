    "main_text": "\n\nThough not all scholars agree on the meaning of the term,\n\u201cneoliberalism\u201d is now generally thought to label the\nphilosophical view that a society\u2019s political and economic\ninstitutions should be robustly liberal and capitalist, but\nsupplemented by a constitutionally limited democracy and a modest\nwelfare state. Recent work on neoliberalism, thus understood, shows\nthis to be a coherent and distinctive political philosophy. This entry\nexplicates neoliberalism by examining the political concepts,\nprinciples, and policies shared by F. A. Hayek, Milton Friedman, and\nJames Buchanan, all of whom play leading roles in the new historical\nresearch on neoliberalism, and all of whom wrote in political\nphilosophy as well as political economy. Identifying common themes in\ntheir work provides an illuminating picture of neoliberalism as a\ncoherent political doctrine.\n\nAfter outlining some inadequate characterizations of neoliberalism,\nthis entry critically discusses neoliberal attitudes towards\nliberalism, capitalism, democracy, and the welfare state, and ends\nwith a discussion of common criticisms.\n",
