    "main_text": "Definitions of Disability || Philosophical Definitions of Disability\n2.2 Philosophical Definitions of Disability\n\nOutside of legal and policy interpretation, philosophers have made a\nnumber of claims about the definition of\n\u201cdisability\u201d\u2014at first, mostly only in passing,\nduring discussion of other matters, like \u201cdisease\u201d and\n\u201chealth\u201d; later as an increasingly important philosophical\ntopic in its own right.\n2.2.1 Normal-Function Views\n\nGiven the pervasiveness of medical models of disability in the\nculture, one would think that at least some recent philosophers would\ndefend a view of disability on which it is defined in terms of\npathology or departure from normal functioning (see entry on\n concepts of health and disease).\n So far we can tell, however, no one has done so explicitly, in print.\nChristopher Boorse, perhaps, comes closest, when he says:\n\n\nat first sight, one expects disability [\u2026] to consist\nof a pathological condition severe enough to have certain morally and\nlegally important effects. (Boorse 2010: 60\u201361)\n\n\nThough Boorse only broaches the possibility of such a definition,\nwithout defending, his broader views about health and disease may seem\nto support this approach. If, as Boorse argues there is a good\nnaturalistic sense of \u201cpathology\u201d as (statistically)\ndownward departure from species-typical functioning, then that notion\ncan be inputted into our moral and political thinking to produce a\ndefinition of disability on the following pattern:\n\n\nS is disabled, in a context C, iff\n\nS has a pathology\u2014that is, some part of their body\nperforms its normal function at statistically subtypical levels,\nIn C, that pathology causes effects that make a\ndifference, of kind D, to how S ought legally or\nmorally to be treated\n\n\n\nTo fully develop this view, of course, one would need to say what sort\nof moral/legal difference pathology is supposed to make\u2014not just\nany difference will do, since it would not follow from the fact, say,\nthat everyone has a legal or moral right to treatment for transient\ninjuries or diseases that all these conditions are disabilities. Note\nalso that, though this view mentions the medical concept of pathology,\nas a definition of disability it does not entail a medical\nmodel, or indeed even the denial of the affirmational model. The\nmedical/social debate will turn on the extent to which it is pathology\nitself that makes a moral difference, rather than pathology\nin combination with social factors. The affirmational model debate\nwill turn on just which effects are definitive of disability; if these\nare all negative or harmful, it will be harder to understand\ndisability as something to be proud of. But the bare fact that\ndisability arises from pathology, on this definition, does not\nnecessarily preclude pride in it, given Boorse\u2019s normatively\nneutral definition of pathology.\n\nThat said, few philosophers seem inclined to defend this way of\ndefining disability. Many philosophers are skeptical of the analytic\ndivision between facts about bodily function and social and ethical\nnorms, arguing that there is no way to define disease or pathology\nindependent of \u201cnormative\u201d considerations (Wakefield 1992;\nKingma 2007; entry on\n concepts of health and disease).\n Those sympathetic to the claims of the disability may have more\nspecific qualms, as well. Those attracted to the \u201chuman\nvariation\u201d version of the social model may be skeptical that all\nof the bodily difference that make for disability are statistically\natypical in the required way, e.g., very common or universal\nconditions like age-related hearing loss or atherosclerosis. Those who\ntend more to a \u201cminority group\u201d model will tend to see the\nbodily differences that matter to disability as perceived or\nrepresented difference, rather than actual difference. And anyone with\nany sympathy to the social model at all will tend to think that,\nas-so-far stated, this definition puts its philosophical precision in\nthe wrong place: that it is at least as important to understand what\nsocial, moral, and legal effects characterize disability as to\nunderstand which sorts of causes these effects must have to count as\n\u201cdisabling\u201d.\n2.2.2 The Welfarist View\n\nKahane and Savulescu (2009; Savulescu & Kahane 2011) propose a\nreforming definition of disability that promises to avoid potentially\nproblematic references to pathology. Their basic idea is that a\ndisability is a (broadly) bodily condition that makes its bearer worse\noff. To wit:\n\n\n\u201cdisability\u201d should refer to any stable physical or\npsychological property of subject S that leads to a\nsignificant reduction of S\u2019s level of wellbeing in\ncircumstances C, excluding the effect that this\ncondition has on wellbeing that is due to prejudice against S\nby members of S\u2019s society. (Savulescu & Kahane\n2011: 45.)\n\n\nThis view adopts certain insights of the social model: in particular\nin holding that disability is relative to circumstance and in\ndownplaying the role of pathology or biological abnormality in\ndefining disability (note there is no reference to\n\u201cimpairment\u201d, not even records or appearance of\nimpairment).\n\nIn other ways, however, it seems to be significantly out of step with\nboth the letter and the spirit of social models of disability. On this\ndefinition, a condition which is only harmful in virtue of\nsocial prejudice would not be a disability. Even the softer social\nmodel implicit in the Americans with Disabilities Act allows that\nsome people are disabled solely in virtue of being\n\u201cregarded as\u201d impaired; those in that group who experience\ndiscrimination as a result would still not be \u201cdisabled\u201d\non Kahane and Savulescu\u2019s view. Just how out of step this\njudgment is with the usual commitments of the social model, may depend\non the relative importance it places on prejudice as compared to other\nfactors in producing disability disadvantage. A social model that\ncleaves closely to a \u201cminority group\u201d understanding of\nableist injustice may find that this definition excludes the paradigm\ncases of disability, people who experience gross or net reductions in\nadvantage due to prejudicial phenomenon like stigma and intentional\nexclusion. A \u201chuman variation\u201d account of most disability\ndisadvantage would see more possibility for people to be disadvantaged\nby non-prejudicial mismatches between atypical bodies and societies\nbuilt for typicality, since this account will say that many of the\nwelfare costs experienced by people with atypical bodies are not a\nresult of prejudicial attitudes per se, even if they often\nreflect structurally unjust failures of inclusion.\n\nIt should be even more clear that the affirmational model of\ndisability is in substantial tension with this harm-requiring\ndefinition of disability. Granted, affirmation of disability may not\nbe formally inconsistent with defining it in terms of harm, since it\nis possible in principle to take pride in or otherwise be glad about\nsomething that leads to a reduction in our well-being (since there are\nthings in life that matter, besides our own well-being). But\naffirmational models generally hold that being disabled is not always\nor in general a cost to our well-being (Swain & French 2000;\nBarnes 2016). This would be a conceptual falsehood, on the welfarist\nview: something which is not a cost to well-being in some\ncontext is simply not a disability.\n\nAre these decisive problems for defining disability in terms of\nwelfare? Much depends here on what we intend to do with definitions of\ndisability. If the goal is to capture ordinary usage, a welfarist view\nmay be on the right track. It might account, for instance, for the\nbroad appeal of slogans like \u201cdeafness is not a\ndisability\u201d and euphemisms like \u201cdifferently abled\u201d;\nthese expressions, on this view, would be ways of emphasizing some of\nthe substantive evaluative intuitions behind the affirmative model,\nthat most conditions we call disabilities are not so bad absent\nprejudice. That said, disability scholars and activists have tended to\nbe skeptical of such expressions, on the grounds that they undermine\nefforts to see disabled people as a politically salient group with\nsimilar experience of ableism and strong reason to work together for\njustice, rather than to simply commiserate. If a definition of\ndisability should advocate in favor of usages that produce a better or\nmore just world, this might be a reason to reject Kahane and\nSavulescu\u2019s view, in favor of one that allows people to be\ndisabled due to prejudice and/or in the absence of harms to\nwell-being. Or at least, this will be so if the social and/or\naffirmational models of disability have the moral and political\nadvantages proponents advertise for them.\n2.2.3 Social Constructionisms\n\nMost philosophers who have considered the definition of disability in\nrecent years have written in sympathy with either or both of the\nsocial or affirmational model of disability.\n\nElizabeth Barnes\u2019s critique of definitional claims implicit in\nthe social model has been a signal moment in the recent debate. Barnes\nis concerned that thinking of disability as a stigmatizing,\noppressive, and exclusionary response to bodily difference does not\ndistinguish disability from other properties grounded in responses to\nthe body, like (on many accounts) race, gender, and sexual orientation\nidentities.\n\nBarnes develops an alternative view which still defines disability as\na social property\u2014but in a way that fits the affirmational model\nbetter than the definitions suggested by classic social models, doing\naway with the distinction between disability and impairment and making\nno direct reference whatsoever to injustice or disadvantage. Barnes\n(2016) proposes to define disability in terms of the judgments of\ndisabled people themselves, not society as a whole. To wit, S\nis (physically) disabled if and only if:\n\nS is in some bodily state x; [such that]\nThe rules for making judgments about solidarity employed by the\ndisability rights movement classify x in context C\nas among the physical conditions that they are seeking to promote\njustice for.\n\n\nThis makes who is disabled a social construction\u2014dependent on\nthe attitudes and commitments of a particular, self-identified group\nof people in contemporary society, the \u201cdisability rights\nmovement\u201d, composed of self-identified disabled and nondisabled\nmembers. It thus raises the concern that a disability movement might\nseek justice for the wrong people. Couldn\u2019t some of those people\ncomplain that they should be included in the aims of that movement,\nprecisely, because they are disabled? Barnes responds in two ways. The\nfirst is to note that she appeals to the rules for\njudgment-making, rather than judgments themselves; some people might\nnot actually be included in the disability rights\nmovement\u2014say, because of internal prejudices on the part of\nthose within the movement\u2014but if this is inconsistent with the\nreasons for including others, then the excluded people will count as\ndisabled too, on Barnes\u2019 account. Still one might ask, what if\nthe rules themselves were bad rules, wrongly but consistently\nexcluding some people form the ambit of the struggle against ableism?\nBarnes, in response to this, rigidifies, insisting that we judge\ndisability relative to the rules of the actual disability\nmovement, even when we are imagining situations where that movement\nshould use different rules than it actually does.\n\nSome are not convinced by this last reply. For it can seem to give too\nmuch weight to judgments of the actual disability rights movement. As\nJenkins and Webster point out, \u201crigidifying\u201d to the actual\nworld in this way means that imagining a world with a different\ndisability rights movement isn\u2019t imagining a world with\ndifferent disabled people. But what if the disability rights movement\nis different there because social conditions are different, warranting\na different set of rules for determining which people with\npathologized bodily difference to seek justice for? And indeed\nisn\u2019t there a sense in which \u201cthere\u201d could be\n\u201chere\u201d? That is, couldn\u2019t the disability right\nmovement as it actually is, use rules that even when consistently\napplied lead it to seek justice for the wrong people (Wasserman 2018;\nHoward & Aas 2018; Lim 2018)?\n\nThis last concern can be generalized. Chong-min Lim, responding to\nBarnes, questions why the disability movement alone should have the\nauthority to constitute disability. Where, we might ask, does this\nleave the experience of disabled people not part of the movement, or\nof those caregivers and/or non-disabled loved ones who advocate for\nthem? And couldn\u2019t the disability movement be overinclusive too,\nin principle, attempting to expand solidarity beyond what makes sense\nmorally or politically. To address this problem (and in the process,\nexpand the account to cover cognitive and other\n\u201cnon-physical\u201d disabilities), Lim proposes that we make\nthe following modification to Barnes\u2019 account:\n\n\nS, is disabled in context, C, if and only if:\n\nS is in some state, x;\nx is constitutive, in C, of some constraint on\nS\u2019s legitimate interests;\nx is regarded, in C, as the subject of\nlegitimate medical interest;\nthe rules employed by the disability rights movement classify\nx in C as among the traits that they are seeking to\npromote progress and change for. (Lim 2018: 987)\n\n\n\nRelative to Barnes, II and III are new restrictions, while IV is a\nsubstantially broadened version of the main clause of Barnes\u2019\napproach\u2014in effect, broadening the relevant goals to include any\nimprovement in the lives of putatively disabled people, whether that\ncomes from social change or bodily transformation. Relatedly, III\nseems to bring back in medicalization\u2014though now constrained by\nthe requirement that the medical interest in question be\n\u201clegitimate\u201d, meaning, not apt in the traditional\nsense (not, concerned with pathology) but rather\njust or right; morally legitimate in light of\nwhatever morally appropriate role medicine has to play in our society.\nLim introduces these conditions to reflect the fact that expert\ncommunities outside of the disability rights movement have expertise\nrelevant to constituting the disability population; parents or\ncaregivers, even those not part of the movement itself, may have\ninsight into whether and how a condition affects legitimate interests,\nwhile physicians will have important (though not exclusive) knowledge\nof which limitations on function are legitimately subject to medical\ninterest.\n\nThe (intended) effect of Lim\u2019s modifications, then, would be to\nlimit the authority of the particular political judgments of the\nactual disability rights movement in determining who is disabled. This\npoints to what may be a deeper problem for Barnes\u2019 account, and\nthe parts of Lim\u2019s that follow her in making recognition by the\nrules that guide the disability movement determinative of disability.\nIf the disability movement ought to adopt rules that pick out a\ncertain group, isn\u2019t that precisely because that group shares\nsome other property, that makes that choice reasonable? That is,\nisn\u2019t there something that those the disability rights movement\nshare, that explains why they ought to seek justice in solidarity\ntogether? Wouldn\u2019t that thing, whatever it is, make a better\ncandidate definition of disability? To put the question for\nLim\u2019s account in particular: why would we want to deny that a\ncondition is a disability, it if were a medically interesting\nconstraint on legitimate interests, but not recognized as such by the\nrules of the disability rights movement?\n\nHoward and Aas (2018) respond to Barnes in a different way, developing\na definition that harkens back to the classic social model of\ndisability. Building on the work of Sally Haslanger (2000) on gender\nand race, they define disability classically as a certain sort of\nsocial response to impairment. On their view, person S is\ndisabled in a context C, iff\n\nS is in some bodily or psychological state x\n[such that]\nx is regularly assumed in the ideology in C to\ninvolve an impairment: a dysfunctional bodily state that limits a\nmajor life activity, and\nin the dominant ideology of C, that someone in x\nhas an impairment explains why they can be appropriately pitied,\nstigmatized, and excluded from socially valued activities and\nstatuses.\nThe fact that S is in this state plays a role in\nS\u2019s systemic disadvantage: that is, (i)\u2013(iii)\nactually explains why S is involuntarily excluded from\ncertain valued activities or relegated to a marginal status along some\nsignificant social dimension. (2018: 1128\u20131129)\n\n\nImpairment is critical on this analysis. Disability is distinct from\nother bodily-based social categories on this definition precisely\nbecause it is a response, of a certain distinctive sort, to social\nperception about bodily properties, namely impairment. Race,\ngender, and orientation identity would be different (thought possibly\noverlapping) responses to different (again, possibly overlapping)\nbodily properties. Howard and Aas do not, however, defend the\nbiological reality of impairment; it suffices for their account that\nsociety itself employs some notion of biological abnormality or\ninsufficiency, saying with the classic social model that disability is\na matter of being classified as impaired, and excluded on that\nbasis.\n\nBarnes (2018) responds that, because of this last feature, this\naccount does not after all give sufficiently central place to bodily\ndifference. In particular, she thinks it makes it hard to see how the\nbodily differences characteristic of disability could be, as the\naffirmation model has it, something to be proud of. They are,\nafter all, picked out negatively, by reference to disadvantage and\nsocial exclusion. Bodily features picked out for their role in the\nstruggle for disability justice seem to be a better candidate source\nof joy, identification, and pride. The success of Barnes\u2019\nresponse depends on how exactly disability pride is supposed to work,\nand on how exactly definitions like these are supposed to serve the\ninterests of the struggle against injustice. Among other things,\nreflection on related cases involving racialized body features\nsuggests that it is possible to take pride in something that others\nrespond to in oppressive and stigmatizing ways. On this understanding,\nthe pride is not in the oppression, but in the oppression-triggering\nfeature itself or in a skillful or solidaristic response to\noppression.\n\nJenkins and Webster (2021) propose a different sort of\nsocial-construct definition of disability\u2014or actually, three\ndifferent but closely related definitions. Like Barnes, Howard, and\nAas, they are interested in understanding what bodily differences are\ncentrally relevant to disability. But they cleave closer to the human\nvariation model than the minority group model in understanding these\ndifferences. Their key notion is what they call marginalized\nfunctioning: having a body that does not work in the way that\nour socially constructed world expects. Each of their three\ndefinitions of disability presuppose this notion; to wit:\n\n\nMF1: A subject S is [physically] disabled if\nthey have marginalized functioning relative to a context, C,\nwhere this is the case iff:\n\nthere is a set of social norms N, comprising \\(n_1,\\)\n\\(n_2,\\) \u2026\\(n_n,\\) each of which serves as a default for the\npurposes of constructing common social environments and structuring\ncommon social interactions in C; and\nthere is some norm in N, \\(n_x,\\) such that S\ncannot physically function in a way that satisfies it. (2021: 8)\n\n\n\nIt might seem that this account, and indeed Howard and Aas\u2019s,\nimplies that there could be no disability in a just society. Though\nthis is a classic claim of the traditional British social model of\ndisability (UPIAS 1976), some find it implausible. Note, however, that\nneither of these views in fact implies the impossibility of disability\nin a just society (even if their language sometimes suggests it). For\nneither view, in itself, implies that the social responses that\nconstitute most disabled people as such are necessarily\nunjust (though surely all four authors would agree that in the actual\nworld, they usually are). If it is morally legitimate to set society\nup in a way that is designed for the functioning of most but not all\nits members\u2014and it may well be, given how costly it would be to\nget anywhere near complete and comprehensive inclusion (Barclay\n2018)\u2014then some forms of functioning could be marginalized or be\na source of disadvantage, even in a just society. And, thus, those\nthat function in those marginalized ways, could be disabled.\n\nA more significant prima facie concern for MF1 is that it\nseems to include amongst the disabled people with merely transitory\nmismatch between body and society\u2014say, someone who broke one or\nboth arms, and therefore cannot open doors or otherwise do what\nsociety expects people to be, physically, able to do. These people do\nnot normally identify and are not normally identified as disabled. To\ncapture this, Jenkins and Webster propose that we might move, simply,\nto:\n\n\nMF2: someone is disabled in a context if and only if\nthey have lasting marginalized functioning in that context; OR\n\nMF3: someone is disabled in a context if and only if\nthey experience disability-characteristic oppression because they have\nmarginalized functioning in that context\n\n\nMF2 solves the problem of temporary conditions by stipulation. This\nmay or may not be good enough here, depending on whether we think\ntemporary conditions (e.g., post-concussion syndrome or pregnancy) can\nbe disabilities. MF3 faces some of the same problems as other\nsocial-model-inspired definitions\u2014particularly, that it seems to\ndefine disability in terms of a kind of oppression, and therefore in\nterms of something bad, something that is therefore (arguably)\ndifficult to be proud of or happy about. Further, by requiring that\noppression be caused by functioning that actually fails to\nfit going norms and expectations, it does not clearly classify as\ndisabled people who are disadvantaged by false perceptions\nregarding their bodily differences\u2014again, failing to follow the\nADA in its well-considered inclusion of people \u201cregarded\nas\u201d, but not, impaired, in its definition of disability (Francis\n2018). It remains to be seen whether the advantages of this definition\nare great enough to justify excluding such \u201cregarded\u201d as\npeople as disabled.\n2.2.4 Inability Views\n\nIn their influential book From Chance to Choice, Buchanan,\nBrock, Daniels, and Wikler (2000) propose the following definition,\nmeant as an explication of the legal and policy decisions considered\nabove.\n\n\nTo have a disability is to be unable to perform some significant range\nof tasks or functions that individuals in someone\u2019s reference\ngroup (e.g., adults) are ordinarily able to do, at least under\nfavorable conditions, where the inability is not due to simple and\neasily corrigible ignorance or to lack of the tools or means\nordinarily available for performing such tasks or functions. (2000:\n286)\n\n\nThis defines disability colloquially, in terms of ability; disability\nis, roughly, an unusual inability. Barnes and others object, however,\nthat this definition is too broad. It seems to make it the case, for\ninstance, that someone who cannot \u201croll their tongue\u201d or\ndo mental subtraction is disabled; since most people can do this under\nfavorable conditions. Conversely, this sort of view also seems to\nundergenerate disabilities, since some (fibromyalgia or depression for\ninstance), only make it more difficult to do things, without making\nany particular task or function straightforwardly unachievable. And it\nis not entirely clear how this account avoids the obviously\nproblematic implication that identity categories like race, gender,\nand sexual orientation imply disability; someone subject to social\nprejudice in virtue of their gender or the color of their skin might\nbe, for that reason, unable to do things others can do.\n\nAlex Gregory (2020) takes a different approach to defining disability\nin terms of inability:\n\n\nThe Inability Theory: To be disabled is to be less able to do\nsomething than is typical, where this degree of inability is partly\nexplained by features of your body that are atypical. (2020: 26)\n\n\nThis definition of disability brings the body into the definition, but\nit is meant to be neutral between more-medical and more-social ways of\nseeing disability. \u201cAtypical\u201d features need not be\n\u201cabnormal\u201d in a medicalizing sense; they are simply\ndifferent, not necessarily worse. To say that an inability that comes\nto disability must be at least partly explained by bodily features is\nconsistent, both, with saying that it is entirely explained by them (a\nla the medical model) and that it is also partly explained by social\nfactors. This in itself rejects the medical model as a general claim,\nas well as the less nuanced statements of the social model, that would\ndefinitionally exclude non-social inabilities from the ambit of\n\u201cdisability\u201d.\n\nThe initial statement of the Inability Theory would still seem to be\noverinclusive; someone who cannot get a good job because of the color\nof their skin, or marry the person they love because of their sexual\norientation, has an atypical inability explained by an atypical bodily\nfeature. To rule these cases out, Gregory moves to:\n\n\nThe Final Inability Theory: To be disabled is to be less able to do\nsomething than is typical, where this degree of inability (1) is\npartly explained by features of your body that are atypical, and (2)\nis not explained by anyone\u2019s attitudes toward those bodily\nfeatures. (2020: 33)\n\n\nThis does plausibly avoid the problem of classifying sexual and\nracialized minorities at least as disabled; any inability engendered\nby color of skin is explained entirely by prejudicial attitudes. (Or\nso it may seem; more below). But in the process it also raises a\nrecurring problem\u2014where an atypical feature is only\ninability-generating because of attitudes specifically about\nwhether it is inability-generating. If people think that people\nwith, say, Down syndrome, cannot benefit from education, they will not\nbe educated; when they do not develop the skills they could have\ndeveloped, that lack of skill is, then, explained by a combination of\natypical bodily features and attitudes towards those features. It can\nseem plausible to say, with the ADA, that discrimination rooted in a\npathologized understanding of a trait is a kind of disability\ndiscrimination.\n\nMoreover, this analysis also raises some of the same concerns as those\nBarnes and others pressed against Buchanan et alia\u2019s\nexplication of disability as biologically abnormal limitation. For\nhere even more than there it seemed like not every limitation on\nability, not even every one explained by atypicality or abnormality,\nis a disability properly-so-called. Gregory, however, has a novel\nresponse here\u2014insisting that these are, really, disabilities,\nbut just not normally worth calling attention to as\n\u201cdisabilities\u201d, since the aptness of this ascription in\nconversational context depends on the significance of the abilities at\nissue.\n\nThis proposal raises other problems, however.. Recall race and sexual\norientation. A person with light-colored skin cannot work in even\nrelatively moderate sun all day without getting a sunburn. Someone\nwith exclusively same-sex orientation cannot have procreative sex with\nsomeone for whom they have romantic and sexual feelings. These are\ninabilities explained by bodily difference, not by attitudes, and they\nare not insignificant or trivial ones: yet it seems they are not\ndisabilities, not even a little bit.\n\nWhy not? The social constructionist views considered above would give\none kind of answer\u2014pointing to the facts that (depending on the\nview):\n\nthe disability rights movement is rationally unconcerned with\nproperties like race and orientation; or\nthat race and orientation are not targeted by ableist\nideology for exclusion and stigmatization; or\nthat our actual social norms do not marginalize these\nconfigurations of bodily function, in the way they marginalize\nparadigm impairments.\n\n\nAn alternative, more positive approach, which remains focused squarely\non ability, would hold that these inabilities, like the minor\ninabilities considered above, are not relevant to disability because\ntheir absence does not place claims on others, in justice. To wit,\nJessica Begon (2021)\n\n\nThus, I define disability as the restriction in the ability to perform\nthose tasks human beings are entitled to be able to perform as a\nmatter of justice, as the result of the interaction between an\nindividual\u2019s impairment, their social and political context, and\nthe resources they have available to them. (2021: 936\u2013937)\n\n\nIt turns out that by impairment Begon simply means \u201catypical or\nunusual functioning\u201d, not pathological or life-limiting\nfunctioning; so, this account is actually structurally more similar to\nGregory\u2019s than to Buchanan et alia. The difference is that the\nspecific absence of ability that constitutes a disability is the\natypicality-caused absence of abilities we ought to have, or\nanyway that our societies ought to provide for us.\n\nThis account has a natural response to the problems of non-disability\ninabilities. No one is entitled to roll their tongue (at least in any\nsocial environment remotely like our own); thus, nobody is disabled\nbecause they cannot do so. Nor, in most circumstances, are we entitled\nto sit unprotected all day in the sun without paying the consequences.\nWe might be entitled to protection by sunscreen, or to the opportunity\nto escape the sun, but we are not entitled to have the ability to\nwithstand the sun if we choose to forgo these protections. Similarly,\nit seems plausible to deny that anyone is entitled to procreate\nsexually with their romantic partner; there may be entitlements to\nbecome a parent, perhaps even a genetic parent, but they need not be\nrealized in this way. Thus, Begon\u2019s account appears at first\nglance not to overgenerate disabilities, as other inability-based\naccounts seem to.\n\nThat said, the account still faces some of the problems we see with\nother ability-limitation-based accounts. The non-pathologizing sense\nof impairment as \u201cfunctional difference\u201d may not in the\nend be specific enough to distinguish disability from other kinds of\nunjust absence of ability. Begon addresses this in the case of sex\ndifference, arguing\u2014in effect, with Boorse\u2014that\ndifferences in the \u201creference class\u201d or appropriate\nfunctional norms applying to males and females of the species make for\ndifferences in what counts as an impairment between males and females.\nSo, for instance, an inability to get a good-paying job resulting from\npossession of the capacity to menstruate is not a disability, because\nthat capacity is not atypical for female human beings. Such a\nway to address the problem may not cover all forms of oppression since\nmuch oppression seems to be evoked by differences that are functional\nin some sense\u2014sexual orientation relates to the function of our\ndispositions to sexual attraction; absence of athletic ability (within\nthe normal range) to the function of the musculature; even\npigmentation, to the function of the epidermis in protecting the\norganism from the environment.\n\nBegon\u2019s view could avoid classifying inabilities down to these\ndifferences by further multiplication of \u201creference\nclass\u201d, so that, say, being unable to get a job because you are\ngay is not a disability because gay people function typically\n\u201cfor gay people\u201d. But as Elselijn Kingma has argued, in\nresponse to similar maneuvers in the health literature, this kind of\nspecificity seems problematically arbitrary\u2014in the limit,\nthreatening to trivialize the relevant notion of \u201cfunctional\ntypicality\u201d (Kingma 2007). These concerns seem to press back in\nthe direction of Lim\u2019s restriction of disability to responses to\n\u201cmedically significant interests\u201d, or Howard and\nAas\u2019s definition in terms of traits perceived or\nrepresented as functional deficits in the reigning biomedical\nideology.\n\nThere are also questions about how we are to understand the set of\nentitlements relevant to determining when the absence of ability is\nunjust. Begon discusses these issues only briefly (2021: 954, n30); a\nmore fully developed version of the view would have to do more. It\nseems important to abstract from resource constraints, since we would\nnot want to say that someone is only disabled if habilitating them is\ncost-effective relative to other priorities justice gives us, given\nwhat resources we happen to have. But this abstraction threatens to\nmake too many of us disabled, since justice might, absent resource\nconstraints, give us powerful reasons to enable one another to do all\nsorts of things\u2014to give those of below-average height the\nability to dunk a basketball, say; or to give women well-past\nchildbearing age the ability to conceive and gestate children. Perhaps\nwe should do these things in response to these functional\natypicalities; that does not make people disabled, until we are rich\nenough to do them.\n2.2.5 Skepticism about Defining Disabilities\n\nTwo sorts of skeptical responses have greeted the effort to define\ndisabilities as individual traits, conditions, or functions, selected\nby some set of rules or criteria. The first critique is inspired by\nthe work of Michael Foucault on biopower as a form of control\nexercised by modern states over the bodies of their populations\n(Tremain 2017). This critique argues that to focus on individual\ncharacteristics in defining disability is to miss the forest for the\ntrees. \u201cDisability\u201d refers not to a set of individual\ncharacteristics, or to a concept that encompasses such a set, but to a\nmechanism that identifies various types of individual characteristics\nfor the purpose of social control. Notably, Shelley Tremain analyzes\ndisability as a mechanism constructed and maintained by laws, informal\nnorms, cultural understandings and other exercises of biopower.\nImpairments and disabilities only exist within this culturally and\nhistorically contingent apparatus that arose in part as a means for\npeople who saw themselves as \u201cnormal\u201d to regulate those\nthey labeled as \u201cdeviants\u201d.\n\n\n[D]isability is not a metaphysical substrate, a natural, biological\ncategory, or a characteristic that only certain individuals embody or\npossess, but rather is a historically contingent network of force\nrelations in which everyone is implicated and entangled and in\nrelation to which everyone occupies a position. That is, to be\ndisabled or non-disabled is to occupy a certain subject position\nwithin the productive constraints of the apparatus of\ndisability\u2026. (2017: 22).\n\n\nAt first glance, Tremain\u2019s Foucauldian claim can seem to be\ntalking past the interlocutors considered above; no more a distinctive\nanalysis of disability to compete with the foregoing than was\nFoucault\u2019s famous claim that \u201cknowledge is power\u201d a\ncompetitor to Plato\u2019s or Goldman\u2019s or Sosa\u2019s\nanalytic definitions of knowledge (see entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n As in that case, however, a recognition of the role the concept of\ndisability plays in reproducing unjust social conditions can cast\ndoubt on reliability of the commonsense judgments and linguistic\nintuitions appealed to by rival analytic definitions. Such judgments\nand intuitions are, so the Foucauldian could argue, products of the\napparatus, not an independent basis for assessing or understanding its\nassignment of positions. However, several of the analytic accounts\ndiscussed in the preceding action were developed with awareness of and\ndue skepticism towards the ideological roots of prevailing convictions\nabout disability and do not explain disability as a natural,\nbiological category. It is unclear then, if a Foucauldian challenge\ncould undermine the evidence used to develop these accounts.\n\nThe second critique, rather than dismiss the value of philosophical\ndefinitions, emphasizes their multiplicity, maintaining that different\ndefinitions are appropriate in different contexts and for different\npurposes. On this view, the problem with these definitions is that\nthey see themselves as competitors in pursuing a goal that is both\nunattainable and undesirable: a single unified or core definition of\ndisability:\n\n\nMany philosophical disagreements about disability simply overlook the\nfact that the disputants are talking about different phenomena\n(impairment vs. oppression; care vs. justice; legal vs. extra-legal\nobligations, etc.). Some of those disagreements are more productively\narticulated as disagreements on how to handle the polysemy of\ndisability. (Beaudry 2020: 5; see also Beaudry 2016).\n\n\nThough certain ethical or political contexts might call for specifying\nor stipulating a definition, this view holds that we have little\nreason to think we can find, or should seek, a definition of\n\u201cdisability\u201d as a general matter. We are unlikely to find\none because these different definitions will have conceptual and\npractical advantages in different contexts; we should not seek one\nbecause adopting a canonical definition would foreclose our\nrecognition of other characteristics and phenomena with moral and\npractical affinities to what we have decided to call\n\u201cdisabilities\u201d. An open-ended approach, in contrast,\n\u201ccan create avenues for new kinds of emancipatory\nself-understandings\u201d (Beaudry 2020: 13).\n\nBeaudry acknowledges that even open-ended approaches have evidentiary\nconstraints, but these constraints are far looser than any which a\nsingle definition, however nuanced and complex, would impose:\n\n\nDisability remains a term that at least denotes or connotes\n\u201cabnormal embodiments\u201d, including phenomena entirely\nexternal to the bodies of \u201cdisabled persons\u201d (such as\nprejudices directed at imagined abnormal embodiments or strictly\ncultural artifacts). It is a useful commonality between a\nconstellation of discourses that relate to objects that are at least\nunited by this family resemblance and may overlap or interact with\neach other, even though it is unlikely that a \u201cmaster\ntheory\u201d would neatly choreograph all such interactions. (Beaudry\n2020: 17)\n\n\nThis deflationary pluralism, however, arguably overlooks the value of\ncontinuing to seek a single unified or core definition of disability,\nhowever unlikely we are to agree on one. Most philosophers who have\ntaken this tack do so not on the supposition that\n\u201cdisability\u201d or even \u201cimpairment\u201d are natural\nkinds\u2014objective properties that legal and regulatory definitions\nought to track. Rather, they are largely motivated by a belief that\nthere is a set of personal experiences and social responses that\npeople with disabilities have in common, and that ways of precisifying\nthe meaning of \u201cdisability\u201d and \u201cimpairment\u201d\nare likely to work better than others for purposes of framing policies\nand building political movements to address the needs and claims of\nindividuals those sharing such personal experiences and aimed at\naddressing the moral and political of this group.\n\nWhether and to what extent the practical aims these various models of\ndisability seek to serve are best accomplished by many separate\ncontextual definitions, or one sophisticated one is, in the final\nanalysis itself likely to be a difficult ethical, even political,\nquestion. Proponents of social constructionist, ameliorative views of\ndisability, like proponents of similar views of race and gender, have\ntended to think that there are good practical reasons to define these\nnotions broadly, to draw attention to forms of injustice that many\nexperience, together, as a means for building larger and thus more\npowerful coalition to push for positive change. And they have, or\nanyway could, argue that the flexibility and inclusiveness pluralist\ncall for can be accommodated by an open-minded and sensitive debate\nover just what this one solidaristic definition should or should not\ninclude. They might be right, or they might be wrong, but if they are\nwrong, it is not because the philosophical and political project of\noffering a unifying definition is a priori misguided.",
