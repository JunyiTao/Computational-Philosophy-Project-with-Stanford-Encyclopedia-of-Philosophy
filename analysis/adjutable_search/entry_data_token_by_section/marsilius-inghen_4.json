    "main_text": "Teachings || Theology\n2.4 Theology\n\nMarsilius expressed his theological views in a voluminous commentary\non the Sentences. He quoted and often adopted views that were\nput forward by fourteenth-century theologians such as Adam Wodeham and\nGregory of Rimini, but was also influenced by earlier thinkers such as\nThomas Aquinas and Bonaventure. He has serious reservations about the\nuse of logic in theology.\n2.4.1 Attributes and Ideas\n\nIn his discussion of the divine attributes he followed mainly the\nteachings of Adam Wodeham. God is perfectly one. Divine wisdom and all\nother perfections attributed to God are in reality as identical to the\ndivine essence as the divine essence is identical to itself. In the\ndivine essence itself there is no distinction or non-identity\nwhatsoever between the attributes of God. Any distinctions between\ndivine attributes are necessarily of a rational (rather than real)\nnature and are made by\n us.[28]\n\nA similarly radical stance on the unity of God was assumed in his\ntreatment of divine ideas. Ideas are not formally distinct in God, as\nsome Scotists would argue, but only extrinsically and objectively\ndistinct. Their distinction is a consequence of the differences\nbetween the creatures produced by God (which is why Marsilius spoke of\nextrinsic distinction), and of the fact that they are known by God as\ndifferent (which accounts for their objective distinction). God knows\nthat he is the cause of infinitely many differences between creatures.\nThat is why his mind contains infinitely many different\n ideas.[29]\n\nMarsilius criticized Ockham\u2019s view that God\u2019s idea\ncoincides with creation. If this were true, Marsilius argued, the idea\nof producing a stone must be identical with either the stone itself,\nor the stone insofar as it is known by God. If the former, then God\nmust look outside of himself in his idea, which contradicts the\nposition of Augustine, who is quoted by Ockham. If the latter, then\nthe idea of its production is not the stone itself, but rather\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge of the\n stone.[30]\n2.4.2 Theology and Logic\n\nMarsilius advanced his criticism of the use of logic in theology in\nhis discussion of the position of Robert Holcot. Holcot had argued\nthat logically, God can be called the cause of evil. If God is the\ncause of every thing (entitas) and moral evil (malum\nculpae) is a thing, then God is the cause of evil. Marsilius\nacknowledged that the argument is based on true premises, yet the\nconclusion should not be defended as true because it contradicts faith\nand therefore might cause confusion among believers. Theologians\nshould not flaunt their personal skills in logic, but always write out\nof reverence for the divine. Their writings should not erode the\nbeliefs of ordinary people, who are not skilled in logic, but rather\naim to strengthen them\n spiritually.[31]\n\nMarsilius was anxious, however, to avoid the implication that\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge is somehow dependent upon human beings. In\nhis discussion of Adam Wodeham on the causality of the human will, he\ncomplained that Adam had not been emphatic enough on this point, since\nhe allowed the following argument: if an event E will happen\nin the future, then God knows E from eternity; but if\nnot-E will happen, then God knows not-E form\neternity; since man is free, he can choose between E and\nnot-E; therefore, he can change God\u2019s foreknowledge.\nThis argument is logically sound, Marsilius argued, but it easily\nleads to the false conclusion that God\u2019s knowledge depends on\nthe free will of man, which is absurd. The eternal cannot fall under\nthe power of that which is created by it. Therefore, this argument\nshould not be used. It is better to remain on the safe side by\nmaintaining what has always been maintained, namely that God through\nhis absolute omniscience knows the future activities of human beings,\nbut without being dependent on\n them.[32]\n\nAlso in his discussion of trinitarian and Christological issues he\nwarns theologians not to naively follow the rules of logic without\nbearing possible misunderstandings in mind. Although the sentence\n\u2018Christ is only God\u2019 is logically true because Christ is\nGod and no other person born on earth but Christ is God, it is\ndangerous to accept this sentence without further qualifications,\nMarsilius argues, because it seems to confirm the view of those\nheretics who claim that Christ was without a human nature, as the word\n\u2018only\u2019 can be understood to exclude humanity when added to\nthe word\n \u2018God\u2019.[33]\n2.4.3 The Sacraments\n\nIn his treatment of the sacraments at the end of his commentary on the\nSentences, Marsilius drew heavily on the writings of Thomas\nAquinas and Bonaventure. He defended Thomas\u2019s view that the word\n\u2018this\u2019 pronounced by Christ at the Last Supper in uttering\n\u2018This is my body\u2019 (Mk. 14:22) refers to what the bread and\nbody have in common. Thomas of Strasbourg had attacked this view, but\nMarsilius showed that the earlier Thomas was right and the later\n wrong.[34]\n\nIn his discussion of the causality of the sacraments, Marsilius\nfollowed the exposition of Bonaventure, according to whom the\nsacraments have no causality of their own. It is God who acts whenever\nthe sacraments are administered correctly. Only in a broad sense is it\ntrue to say that the sacraments have the power to\n act.[35]\n",
