    "main_text": "Idealist Ethics || Self-Realization and Freedom\n3.4 Self-Realization and Freedom\n\nFreedom is not a concept that looms large in Green\u2019s\nperfectionism in the Prolegomena. However, Green focuses on\nfreedom in the posthumously published essay \u201cOn the Different\nSenses of \u2018Freedom\u2019 as Applied to Will and the Moral\nProgress of Man\u201d (Works II), where he defends a\ntripartite conception of freedom.\n\nJuridical Freedom\nMoral Freedom\nReal or Perfect Freedom\n\n\nJuridical freedom is the absence of compulsion or restraint\nby others. This is freedom as non-interference prized by Locke and\nother liberals. Moral freedom is the sort of freedom required\nfor responsibility, which is manifested in both praiseworthy and\nblameworthy conduct. Moral freedom, Green believes, requires the\ncapacity for reasons-responsiveness. This is the kind of freedom he\nproposes as a response to the problem Sidgwick identifies for Kant.\nReal or perfect freedom exists insofar as an agent exercises\nher moral freedom properly, pursuing her own personal good and its\nconstitutive commitment to the common good. This sort of freedom just\nis self-realization or the perfection of one\u2019s agency.\n\nThough each form of freedom is valuable, both juridical and moral\nfreedom are subordinate to real and perfect freedom (Works II\n308\u201309). Real freedom is the regulative ideal of agency and\ncannot be achieved without juridical and moral freedom, but neither\nare sufficient to produce real freedom (Works II 324). Green\nends up endorsing a version of the Hegelian view that freedom is a\nmatter of degree, and moral progress can be understood as the\nprogressively more perfect realization of real freedom (Works\nII\n 324\u201330).[7]\n\nIn \u201cTwo Concepts of Liberty\u201d Isaiah Berlin famously\ndistinguishes between negative and positive liberty\nand criticizes various conceptions of positive freedom, including\nGreen\u2019s (1958: 132\u201333, 141\u201354). Negative liberty,\nfor Berlin, is focused exclusively on the absence of external\ncompulsion by other individuals or the state. By contrast, positive\nfreedom involves self-determination in which the rational part of\none\u2019s soul is controlling. The rational self is the true self,\nand the true self is realized in the perfection of one\u2019s\nrational nature (1958: 131\u201334, 141\u201353). Berlin thinks that\npositive freedom is pernicious, because true freedom is negative\nfreedom and because positive freedoms smuggle other alleged moral\ngoods in under the guise of freedom, leading us to ignore the costs to\nfreedom that pursuit of these goods involves.\n\nBut Berlin\u2019s criticisms misunderstand Green\u2019s claims about\nfreedom. For Green, negative liberty as noninterference is embodied in\njuridical freedom, and juridical freedom is an important and\nlegitimate part of freedom. But juridical freedom does not exhaust\nfreedom for Green, as it does for Berlin. He puts the point this way\nin \u201cLiberal Legislation\u201d\n\n\nThus, though of course there can be no freedom among men who act not\nwillingly but under compulsion, yet on the other hand the mere removal\nof compulsion , the mere enabling a man to do as he likes, is in\nitself no contribution to true freedom. (Works III 371)\n\n\nGreen also recognizes moral freedom and real or perfect freedom. Moral\nfreedom is the capacity for reasons-responsive conduct, and real or\nperfect freedom is the proper exercise of this capacity, resulting in\nself-realization and its commitment to the common good. These forms of\nfreedom involve positive freedom.\n\nGreen believes that juridical freedom, moral freedom, and real or\nperfect freedom all involve aspects of self-determination\n(\u201cFreedom,\u201d Works II 315\u201316). Both\njuridical freedom and moral freedom are essential to responsibility.\nResponsibility depends on an agent\u2019s normative capacities and\nher opportunity to exercise them free from undue interference with\nothers. We can see this because significant impairment of either the\nagent\u2019s capacities or her opportunities is excusing. Whereas\njuridical freedom depends on the agent\u2019s opportunities, moral\nfreedom depends on her capacities. If so, then self-determination as\nresponsibility requires both juridical and moral freedoms.\n\nIf self-determination involves determination by my rational self, then\nit requires self-realization and real freedom. Here, we should\nremember Green\u2019s Kantian claim that rational nature provides not\nonly the ground of duty but also its content. Moral personality and\nfreedom involve a will that has reasons-responsive capacities. But\nthen self-determination should be expressed in activities that reflect\nand realize these rational capacities (PE \u00a7\u00a7175,\n180, 199, 234, 238\u201339, 247, 283). Full or complete\nself-determination requires not just the capacity to be guided by\nreasons but this aretaic sense of self-determination. On Green\u2019s\nview, this kind of self-determination and self-realization involve a\nconstitutive commitment to a cosmopolitan concern for the common\ngood.\n",
