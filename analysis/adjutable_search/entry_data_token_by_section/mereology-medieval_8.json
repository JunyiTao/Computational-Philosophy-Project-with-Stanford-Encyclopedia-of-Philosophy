His body is composed out of flesh,\nbone, and blood. And the flesh, bone, and blood in turn are ultimately\ncreated by combining the four basic elements, Earth, Air, Fire, and\nWater. All these components of Socrates can be considered integral\nparts of Socrates.\n\nSocrates is divisible into a number of other parts. We can cut\nSocrates in half, and thereby create the top half of Socrates and the\nbottom half of Socrates. We can also divide Socrates into his hands,\nfeet, torso, heart, and so forth. All these products of the divisions\nof Socrates can be considered integral parts of Socrates as well.\n\nMedieval philosophers separate this plethora of integral parts into a\nnumber of distinct categories. The top and bottom halves of Socrates\nare often called quantitative parts, since they divide Socrates solely\nwith respect to a quantity, or measure. Flesh, bone, and blood, as\nwell as the elements that compose these components also are often\ncalled quantitative parts, for they comprise Socrates\u2019 matter,\nand matter is often associated with quantity.\n\nNot all medieval philosophers think that the elements are parts of\nSocrates. Abelard, for example, believes that the elements are\ningredients, but not every ingredient is a part. Strictly speaking,\nonly those items that compose some whole and remain in that whole\nafter composition are parts of the whole (Dialectica\n575.18\u201336). Hence, even though the flour is an ingredient of the\nbread, the flour is not a part of the bread. The flour has been\naltered by a chemical change, and so it does not remain once the bread\nis baked. Likewise, while the elements combine into a chemical mixture\nthat becomes flesh, the earth and water that make up flesh are no\nlonger present. Only the crumbs and flesh are properly parts of the\nbread and Socrates respectively.\n\nMany later medieval thinkers effectively agree with Abelard on this\npoint. The elements that compose my body only exist in actuality when\nmy body has been dissolved back into elemental matter (see Ward 2014,\n125\u201344). While I am alive, these elements only exist\n\u201cvirtually\u201d or \u201cpotentially\u201d in me. Some\nmedieval philosophers went so far as to suggest that most or even all\nthe parts of a substance exist only in potency when the substance is\nactual (see Pasnau 2011, 606\u201329).\n\nMedieval philosophers also like to draw a distinction between the\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous parts of Socrates\u2019 body.\nHeterogeneous parts are such that, if they are themselves divided,\ntheir constituents are not of the same type as the original. For\nexample, a hand is composed out of fingers, knuckles, and a palm. It\nis also, from another viewpoint, composed out of muscles, skin, and\nsinews. No part of the hand is a hand. However, some of the\nhand\u2019s parts are homogeneous. Muscle, skin, and blood are each\nhomogeneous, since every bit of muscle is muscle, every bit of blood\nis itself blood, and every bit of skin is also skin.\n\nThe distinction between heterogeneous and homogeneous parts is\nbequeathed to medieval philosophers by Aristotle and Boethius.\nAristotle imposes a loose hierarchy on these types of parts, claiming\nthat the heterogeneous parts are composed out of homogeneous parts\n(History of Animals 486a13\u201314). This in turn suggests\nthat the division of a whole into its parts is best initiated by\ndividing it into its heterogeneous parts, and only then into its\nhomogeneous parts. Boethius is less explicit, suggesting that there\nmay be many equally acceptable ways to begin to divide up a thing into\nits parts (On Division 888a\u2013b).\n\nMany of the heterogeneous parts of Socrates are best defined in terms\nof their function, not their measure. For example, hands are\ndiscriminated from feet based on what functions they perform for an\nanimal. Many medieval philosophers believe that these functions are\nprovided either by the form or the soul of the animal. For this\nreason, many medieval philosophers call functionally defined parts\n\u201cformal parts\u201d, or parts secundum formam, but in\norder to avoid any confusion, I will refer to parts of this sort as\nfunctional parts. The fourteenth-century philosopher Walter\nBurley tells us that the functional parts \u201cremain the same so\nlong as the whole remains the same and complete\u201d (De toto et\nparte, 301). In other words, so long as Socrates\u2019 soul\noccupies his body, and provided the hand is not cut off,\nSocrates\u2019 hand remains a hand. Burley contrasts functional parts\nwith material parts, and he places homogeneous parts such as flesh,\nbone, and blood under this category. Socrates\u2019 material parts\nare in constant flux; Socrates is constantly losing and replacing bits\nof flesh and blood.\n\nIn addition to the functional parts, Socrates\u2019 substantial form\n(or forms) and his matter (either his prime matter or his proximate\nmatter en masse) can be considered parts of Socrates. But\nhere there is some question as to whether form and matter are\nintegral parts of Socrates. What Boethius says is\nambiguous.\n\nThere is also a division of the whole into matter and form. For in one\nmanner the statue is constructed out of its parts, and in another\nmanner out of matter and form\u2014i.e. out of bronze and its shape\n(species). (On Division 888b [Magee 1998, 40])\n\n\nIt is striking to learn that the form and the matter of the statue are\nnot \u201cparts\u201d, especially since they are products of a\ndivision. Moreover, if a core meaning of \u201cpart of\nx\u201d is \u201cthat out of which x comes to\nbe\u201d (cf. Boethius\u2019 On the Trinity 2), then the\nform and the matter of a thing ought to be the primary parts of that\nthing. Bronze without its form is merely bronze, not a statue;\nSocrates\u2019 matter without Socrates\u2019 substantial form is not\na human. Clearly, then, Boethius cannot mean that form and matter are\nnot parts in any sense.\n\nThe task, then, is to determine what kind of parts form and matter\nare, and especially what kind of parts substantial form and matter\nare. Aquinas routinely distinguishes between the\n\u201cquantitative\u201d parts of a thing and the form and the\nmatter, which he calls \u201cparts of the essence\u201d (Summa\nTheologiae I, q. 8, a. 2, ad 3; I, q. 76, art. 8; III, q. 90, a.\n2). However, he does not provide a clear answer to the question\nwhether the part of an essence is a type of integral part, or whether\nit is a distinct kind of part. Other philosophers present a less\nambiguous line: only parts that make up some quantity can be integral\nparts (see, e.g., Lambert of Auxerre Logica 126; Peter of\nSpain Tractatus V.14 (2014, 212\u20134); Albert of Saxony\nSophismata 45). Accordingly, many medieval thinkers will\npropose that in addition to potential, subjective, and integral parts,\nthere is a fourth kind of part, which I will call a\nsubstantial\n part.[4]\n\nThere are other good reasons why medieval philosophers might be\nmotivated to distinguish the integral parts of a thing from the\nsubstantial parts of the same thing. Firstly, the form does not behave\nlike the integral parts of the thing, since for many Aristotelians\n(and especially, as we saw above, for Aquinas and other unitarians)\nthe form has the unique capacity to be present \u201cas a\nwhole\u201d in each material part of the thing. Integral parts, by\ncontrast, are thought to be unable to be present in more than one\nplace at the same time, and for this reason, the integral parts of a\nthing are said to sit side-by-side, or \u201cpart outside of\npart\u201d (pars extra partem). Secondly, substantial parts\nrequire something else to perfect them (see Albert of Saxony\nSophismata 49). Matter by itself is incomplete; it is only\npotentially this or that thing. Matter needs a form in order to\nactually be this or that thing. Form, too, is in a sense an incomplete\nsubstance. A dog\u2019s form, for instance, is in need of some matter\nin order to be the form of this dog. But more fundamentally, given the\nAristotelian critique of Platonic forms\u2013specifically, the\ncritique of the notion that a form can exist independently of\nmatter\u2013many medieval thinkers will insist that a form is\nincomplete in the sense that it cannot exist unless it is\npart of a substantial composite. Finally, distinguishing between\nsubstantial parts and integral parts captures an important intuition\nabout substances: Socrates can lose and gain matter without\ncompromising his existence. But if Socrates were to lose either his\nmatter in total or his substantial form, he would cease to exist.\n\nIf one draws a sharp distinction between integral parts and\nsubstantial parts, the next natural thought would be to distinguish\nbetween integral and substantial wholes. The trouble is that in many\ncases the same thing seems to be both an integral whole and a\nsubstantial whole. Socrates, for example, has a quantity, and he is\nsurely divisible into smaller quantities. It seems to follow that\nSocrates is an integral whole. But Socrates is also composed of matter\nand substantial form. So, he is a substantial whole. One could reject\nthe notion that Socrates is an integral whole. But, then, what is it\nthat has Socrates\u2019s size? Socrates\u2019 size is supposed to be\nan accident of Socrates, not of a part of Socrates. It is\nperhaps for this reason that some medieval philosophers try a\ndifferent approach. As we already noted, Walter Burley draws a\ndistinction between material parts and parts secundum formam\n(which we called \u201cfunctional\u201d parts, above). Related to\nthis, Burley also draws a distinction between the whole considered in\nrelation to its matter (secundum materiam) and the whole\nconsidered in relation to its form (secundum formam) (De\ntoto et parte, 301). Socrates considered formally\u2014i.e. as a\nunity of this form with some matter\u2014persists through time and\nchange. Socrates considered materially is constantly in flux. That is,\nSocrates on Monday is not the same whole materially as Socrates on\nFriday, because the sum of material parts belonging to Socrates on\nMonday is not identical to the sum of material parts on Friday. The\ndistinction between the whole considered formally and the whole\nconsidered materially will play a role in some medieval theories of\npersistence, and we will pursue this use of the distinction in short\norder (see\n Section 4.2).\n But, first, we must consider the parts of universals and the special\nproblems that the parts of universals entail.\n",
