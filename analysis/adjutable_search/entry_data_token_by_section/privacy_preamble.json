    "main_text": "\n\nEarly debates on privacy began at the end of the nineteenth century,\nwhen the potential intrusion of photography and the (tabloid) press\nwas first recognized. When contrasted with the concerns that we face\ntoday due to the smart devices surrounding us, collecting data, and\ninfluencing our opinions and behavior, the old worries look quite\ninnocent. Recent technology has led to previously unimagined ways of\nobtaining information about people, for observing them, listening in\non their conversations, monitoring their activities and locating their\nwhereabouts. These are not simply \u201cnew technologies\u201d: they\nfundamentally change the social practices in which they are embedded.\nFurthermore, the problem is not simply that having a smartphone\nenables companies to collect huge amounts of personal data, but that\nthis data is used to create profiles of users that can be exploited\nfor political and commercial purposes.\n\nYet there are also social changes of an entirely different sort that\nhave, in various ways, produced constant shifts in the boundaries\nseparating the private and the public realms. These\nchanges include, for example, the fact that women can no longer simply\nbe assigned to the realm of domestic and family labor but are\nincreasingly playing\u2014and wanting to play\u2014an equal role in\ngainful employment and the public sphere. Another social\nchange is that ever since the 1960s, intimacy and sexuality are no\nlonger banished to the private domain but are now openly portrayed and\ndisplayed in a whole range of (social) media.\n\nAn analysis of these changes in the societal meanings of the private\nand the public shows that interest in re-conceptualizing\nprivacy\u2014which is embedded in a broader political and legal\nendeavor of finding and creating appropriate privacy\nprotections\u2014is due to three distinct social-historical\nprocesses. Firstly, recent developments in information technology\nthreaten the protection of personal privacy in fundamentally new\nways; secondly, there have been radical changes in the relation\nbetween the sexes, prompting a concomitant reconfiguration of the\nprivate sphere; and thirdly, there has been an intrusion of intimacy\ninto the public realm through previously private themes that have\nturned public, accompanied by shifts in notions of individuality,\nsubjectivity, and authenticity. These developments suggest that there\nis not one history of the concept of privacy, but that the\nrules that protect privacy today (and the reflection that has gone\nalong with those rules) have been driven by developments and concerns\nin different political and social areas. The history of privacy may\ntherefore include more than what counts as \u201cprivate\u201d at\nany particular time (Westin 1967; Elshtain 1981; Benn & Gaus 1983;\nB. Moore 1984; Ari\u00e8s & Duby 1987; Weintraub & Kumar 1997;\nMcKeon 2007; Vincent 2016; Igo 2018). Finally, these developments\nbring to light the thoroughly conventional nature of the\nseparation between public and private life.\n\nAgainst this background, we can see that there is no single\ndefinition, analysis or meaning of the term \u201cprivacy\u201d,\neither in ordinary language or in philosophical, political and legal\ndiscourse. The concept of privacy has broad historical roots in legal,\nethical, sociological and anthropological discourses. In this article,\nwe will first focus on the histories of privacy in various discourses\nand spheres of life. We will also discuss the history of legislating\nprivacy protections in different times and (legal) cultures. In the\nsecond part, we will consider a range of critiques of\nprivacy\u2014both domestic privacy and the right to privacy\u2014and\nall the relevant arguments and counterarguments forming those\ndebates.\n\nThe third part of this article is devoted to substantial discussions\nof privacy in the literature. This literature distinguishes between\ndescriptive accounts of the meaning of privacy (which\ndescribe what is in fact protected as private), and normative\naccounts of privacy. We will also review discussions that treat\nprivacy as an interest with moral value, and those that refer\nto it as a moral or legal right that ought to be protected\nonly by social conventions or also by the law. As a starting point, we\nwill look more precisely at the various meanings of\n\u201cprivacy\u201d. We will present the semantics of the\nconcept, which some authors claim to be not unifiable, only possessing\na Wittgensteinian sense of family likeness (Solove 2008). The\ndescription of what is in fact protected as private is followed by\nnormative accounts of privacy defending its value,\nand the extent to which it should be protected. The question of\nwhether privacy has to be protected as a conventional interest, a\nmoral right, or a legal right, has been contested for a long time.\n\nThe final section of this article is the longest and most extensive.\nThere, contemporary debates on privacy in public discourse will be\nconsidered, as well as a range of philosophical, legal, and\nanthropological theories, from privacy and health to group privacy,\nthe social dimensions of privacy, and the relationship between privacy\nand power. In the end, it will be concluded that the many debates\nregarding privacy, across very different fields of society, show that\nthe problem of privacy determines to a large degree the personal,\nsocial and political lives of citizens. A free, autonomous life of\nwell-lived relations\u2014intimate, social, and political\u2014is\nbecoming increasingly endangered. Debates about privacy are therefore\nbecoming more and more important, not just in academia, but in the\nsocietal public sphere as well.\n",
