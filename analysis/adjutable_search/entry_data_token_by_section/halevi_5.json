Qualifications for the Attainment of Prophecy and Prophetic Knowledge\n\n\nIt remains, then, to identify what prerequisites must be\nsatisfied if a member of the divine order, understood as dispensation,\nis to attain prophecy and with it receive knowledge of hidden things.\nNotwithstanding Halevi's generally critical stance towards\nphilosophy and the philosopher's opening statement, he does not\nrefrain from appropriating from the philosopher's presentation\nthose elements that he believes to be correct and which might serve,\nwhen fully explained, to advance his general argument on behalf of the\nJews and Judaism. Accordingly, he, too, highlights the influence of (1)\nparents and relatives, (2) geographic environment, as well as (3)\neducation and training as indispensable for realizing as fully as\npossible whatever capacity members of the divine order possess to\nbecome prophets or, at the very least, pious friends of God, just as\nthe philosopher identifies these same factors in the formation of the\nperfect individual who allegedly attains union with the Active\nIntellect.\n\n\nRegarding the first prerequisite, superior lineage, Halevi\ndoes not state explicitly whether the influence of parents and\nrelatives should be construed in biological or psychological terms, or\nperhaps both. Interpreters have tended to understand it as being\nbiological or at least quasi-biological, insofar as it is the means by\nwhich qualified individuals are endowed with or\ninherit a divine faculty that comes after the\nintellect and facilitates contact with God as well as knowledge of\ntruths with only the slightest reflection. (K 1: 95) According to the\nsage, Adam, who was God's own creation and perfectly made, was\nendowed with it. However, he did not succeed in transmitting this\nfaculty to all or even most of his offspring. On the contrary, for\ngenerations it manifested itself only in unique individuals like Abel,\nSeth, Enosh, Noah and others on through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, each\nof whom was the choicest offspring of his father. Sometimes it even\nskipped over a generation. Ultimately, however, all of Jacob's\nsons proved fit for the divine order, and eventually all of their\noffspring, both male and female, came to be endowed with it. It is\nnoteworthy that the presence or absence of this faculty is not\nattributed to a divine choice, but rather to the fitness or unfitness\nof the potential recipients. Still, this unusual pattern of\ntransmission does not make a strictly biological explanation\nparticularly compelling. Further, when it is recalled that the Khazar\nking originally spoke of the secret character of the divine order in\nconjunction with the secret character of certain\nsouls, (K 1:4) a psychological or\neven cultural mode of transmission becomes more plausible. This is\nespecially so when the sage later speaks of the divine faculty or\ncapacity as \u201cthe eye of prophecy,\u201d (K 2:24) and later still\nas the \u201cinner eye\u201d which is \u201calmost\u201d the same\nas \u201cthe imaginative faculty as long as it serves the intellectual\nfaculty.\u201d (K 4:3) All of these remarks all suggest that he is\nprobably referring to either an exceptionally powerful internal sense\nor to a distinctive way of seeing or interpreting what is seen, which\nmight help to explain the link between familial ties and experiencing\nprophecy. Yet even here, Halevi's language is sufficiently\nequivocal to allow for a wide range of interpretations.\n\n\nThe second prerequisite stipulates that one must dwell\nwithin the geographic environment that uniquely fosters the attainment\nof prophecy or for the sake of which it occurs. That turns out to be\nthe region variously identified as Syro-Palestine or the Land of\nIsrael. Halevi explains the region's special standing in terms of\nits ideal configuration of temperate climate, its placement at the\ncenter of the inhabited world (as then known), and its location on the\naxis mundi that historically links heaven and\nearth through prophecy, as depicted in Jacob's dream. For all\nthese reasons, it represents the optimal location not only for the\nattainment of prophecy by qualified members of the divine order, but\nalso for living out the \u201cway of life characteristic of\nGod's kingdom\u201d (K 5: 20, 4th premise) mandated\nby the revealed Law and intended for all who participate in that order,\nwhether by birth or by choice. Indeed, God is portrayed as\ntransplanting \u201chis people\u201d to \u201chis land,\u201d in\norder to realize his purpose for the land itself\u2014to guide the\nentire inhabited world in the right path. (K 1: 95; 2: 9\u201324; 5:\n22\u201328)\n\n\nThe third and final prerequisite identifies exactly what the\ninstruction and training mentioned in the philosopher's speech\nconsists in, if it is to culminate in the experience of prophecy. Here,\nabstract principles, general guidelines, and ad hoc\njudgments, no matter how intelligent or astute, do not suffice\nto produce the desired result. Only adherence to the specific\ncommandments and prohibitions embodied in the Written and Oral Law from\nGod can do so. That is because the specifics in their totality and due\nproportion constitute a regimen that imparts to human souls both the\nconduct and the disposition of the angels. Indeed, Halevi claims that\nperseverance in performing acts mandated by the Law raises one to the\nlevel of revelation, which is the human level closest to the divine. (K\n1: 87, 98; 2:48, 50; 3: 7, 11, 53; 4:19; 5:20, 4th\npremise)\n\n\nWhat ties together these three prerequisites is\nHalevi's attempt to give both actual and specific content to what\nthe philosopher sketched out only in broad outline. His emphasis on\nspecific ancestry and lineage was surely intended to call attention to\nactual people whose lives were characterized by special relationships\nthat could affect the course of history and, as a result, to reconnect\none's own life with theirs. His emphasis on a particular\ngeographical environment was plainly intended to renew and strengthen\nhis people's sense of connection to and love for their ancestral\nhome and, given both the dialogue's ending and Halevi's own\nchoice, a willingness to return it. His emphasis, finally, on the\ncommandments as the clearest embodiments of what is pleasing to God was\nclearly meant to nourish not only respect for the nobility of\nIsrael's ancestral way of life, but also to encourage renewed\ncommitment to that life as defined by worthy deeds and self-mastery\nover and above pleasing intentions and intellectually respectable\nopinions. By the same token, his elaboration of these prerequisites\nover the course of the dialogue may also be intended as a critique of\nphilosophy in the sense that it is by its very nature unable to provide\nmore than general principles and guidelines in the realm of action. Its\npreoccupation with the search for universals inevitably finds claims\nabout special qualities, places, relationships and actions to be, more\noften than not, problematic or na\u00efve, and what Halevi would regard\nas appropriate concern with matters of detail, outside its\npurview.\n",
