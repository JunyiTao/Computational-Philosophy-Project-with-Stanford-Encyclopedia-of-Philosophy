    "main_text": "Epistemology\n4. Epistemology\n\n\nThe Mohists apply several closely interrelated conceptions of\nknowledge, of which the central one is a form of recognition, or\n\u201cknowledge-of.\u201d Knowledge-of is manifested as a practical ability to\ncorrectly distinguish the referent(s) of the word, or \u201cname\u201d\n(ming), that denotes the object of knowledge. It is thus\ninterrelated with and dependent on a kind of practical knowing-how.\nThis knowing-how provides a behavioral criterion by which knowledge is\nassessed: to qualify as having knowledge of x, an agent must\nbe able to reliably pick out the sorts of things denoted by the word\n \u2018x\u2019.[8]\n\n\nThe Mohist conception of knowledge is thus fundamentally practical,\nnot representational or theoretical. Having knowledge is not a matter\nof having a correct representation in one\u2019s mind or being able to give\na theoretical description of some state of affairs, but of being able\nto do something correctly in practice \u2014 specifically, being\nable to distinguish various kinds (lei) of things from one\nanother. Propositional knowledge, to the limited extent that it is\naddressed, is implicitly explained terms of the ability to distinguish\nkinds properly: To know that a is F is to know to\ndistinguish a as the kind of thing denoted by the term\n\u2018F\u2019.\n\n\nThe object of knowledge is typically regarded as a kind of object or\nevent, denoted by a term, rather than a proposition, expressed by a\nsentence. (Grammatically, the verb zhi (to know) most often\ntakes a noun or noun phrase as its object.) Also, since to know a thing\nis to know how to distinguish it from other kinds of things, the object\nof knowledge is sometimes taken to be a distinction, as when the\nMohists speak of \u201cknowing the distinction between righteous and unrighteous\u201d\n(Book 17, \u201cCondemning Aggression\u201d).\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 primary conception of knowledge is illustrated in\nfollowing passage, which emphasizes that knowledge lies not in the\nability to make correct statements, but the ability to \u201cselect\u201d the\nthings denoted by a word, or \u201cname.\u201d\nOur Master Mozi said, \u201cNow the blind say,\n\u2018What\u2019s bright is white, and what\u2019s dark is black.\u2019 Even\nthe clear-sighted have no grounds for changing this. But collect white\nand black things together and make the blind select from among them,\nand they cannot know. So as to my saying the blind don\u2019t know white\nand black, it\u2019s not by their naming, it\u2019s by their selecting.\u201d\n(Book 47, \u201cValuing Duty\u201d)\n\n\nThe passage depicts the knowledge the blind possess of the colors\nwhite and black as, what we would characterize as, propositional\nknowledge. Yet the text\u2019s central claim is that the blind do\nnot qualify as \u201cknowing white and black,\u201d because they are\nunable to identify them in practice. For the Mohists, the key\ncriterion of knowledge is not the mere ability to make correct\nstatements \u2014 as when the blind \u201cuse the names\n\u2018white\u2019 and \u2018black\u2019 in strings the same way\u201d\nas the sighted \u2014 but the ability to \u201cdistinguish the things\u201d\ndenoted by these words (Book 19, \u201cCondemning Aggression\u201d).\n\n\nA natural response here would be to point out that the Mohists\u2019 own\nview implicitly recognizes that knowledge of words, or \u201cnames,\u201d\nconstitutes a separate type of knowledge, distinct from knowledge of\nhow to \u201cselect\u201d things. The Mohists ought to categorize knowledge more\nfinely, the response would run, by distinguishing between knowing how\nto use names and knowing how to distinguish the referents of\nnames. (Full mastery of a concept would presumably require both\nabilities.) The later Mohist texts do precisely this, presenting a\nfourfold categorization of knowledge that includes knowledge of names,\nknowledge of things, knowledge of relations between names and things,\nand knowledge of how to act (see the separate entry for \u201cMohist\nCanons\u201d). Nevertheless, in this earlier text, no value is attached to\nknowledge of names. What counts as genuine knowledge is the reliable\nability to distinguish things in practice.\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 view of knowledge thus illustrates the practical\norientation of early Chinese thought, as sketched in the discussion of\nfa (models) in the previous section. For the Mohists, knowing\nx does not require knowing the definition, the essence, the\nmeaning, the Platonic Form, nor a description of x. It\nrequires only the practical ability to distinguish x from\nnot-x. This pragmatic view of knowledge contrasts with the\nsemantic orientation of the Greek tradition, as epitomized by\n Plato.[9]\n We find Plato asking What is justice? and\nseeking to answer this question by determining the single essential\nform shared by all just things. By contrast, the Mohists never ask what\nthe essence or definition of yi (righteousness) is. They are\nconcerned only with the problem of how to reliably distinguish\nyi from not-yi. This problem can be solved, they\nassume, by finding appropriate models for drawing the distinction and\nteaching everyone to apply or emulate them. Such models may have a\nutilitarian, empirical basis; they may rest on independent moral\ngrounds; or they may be based simply on the conviction that the actions\nof exemplary moral agents, such as Tian (Heaven) and the\nancient sage-kings, cannot be wrong.\n\n\nThe Mohist conception of knowledge includes no explicit element\ncorresponding to the justification component in the traditional Western\nanalysis of knowledge as justified true belief. Instead, the Mohists\nseem to treat knowledge simply as correct judgment, which they\nunderstand as correct distinction drawing. Justification is not\nidentified as a distinct requirement for knowledge, probably because\nthe Mohists\u2019 conception of \u201ccorrect\u201d distinction drawing implicitly\nincorporates an element of reliability. Knowledge is not merely drawing\na distinction correctly in one case or another, but a reliable ability\nor disposition to draw distinctions correctly in a variety of cases\nover time.\nNow suppose there is a person here, who, seeing a little\nblack, says \u201cBlack,\u201d but seeing much black, says\n\u201cWhite.\u201d Then surely we\u2019d take this person to not know the\ndistinction between white and black. Tasting a little of something\nbitter, he says \u201cBitter,\u201d but tasting much of something\nbitter, he says, \u201cSweet.\u201d Then surely we\u2019d take this\nperson to not know the distinction between sweet and bitter. (Book 17,\n\u201cCondemning Aggression\u201d)\n\n\nA plausible account of the purpose of the justification component in\nthe traditional tripartite analysis of knowledge is that it\ndisqualifies accidentally true beliefs \u2014 beliefs that happen to be\ntrue, but are based on no good reason \u2014 from counting as knowledge.\nThe Mohists handle this issue implicitly, by acknowledging only\nreliably correct distinction drawing as knowledge. Here again, their\nconception of knowledge reflects their overall focus on practical\nperformance. Fundamentally, for them knowledge is not a correspondence\nbetween a mental state and the world, but an ability to perform certain\nskills reliably and correctly.\n\n\nAccordingly, cognitive error \u2014 false assertion or belief \u2014\nis not explained as inaccurate representation, as a lack of\ncorrespondence between assertion or belief and reality, or as a\nfailure to grasp the unchanging reality behind shifting sensory\nappearances. (The distinction between appearance and reality plays no\nrole in Mohist thought and probably none in early Chinese thought as a\nwhole.) Instead, error is understood as \u201cdisorder\u201d (luan) or\n\u201cconfusion\u201d (huo) in drawing distinctions, in effect a\nfailure to perform a skill correctly. Immorality is due to a failure\nto know how to distinguish right from wrong. Those who perpetrate\nunprovoked military aggression, for example, are criticized for the\n\u201cdisorder\u201d in how they distinguish righteous (yi) from unrighteous\n(Book 17, \u201cCondemning Aggression\u201d).\nThe Three Fa (Models) and the Problem of Justification\n\n\nThe discussion of Mohist epistemology presented so far has been based\non an interpretation of the conception of knowledge implicit in the\nMohists\u2019 remarks in a variety of contexts. Since, unlike the Mohist\nCanons, early Mohist texts do not treat the concept of knowledge\nexplicitly, this interpretation is necessarily conjectural and\nincomplete. When we turn to the issue of justifying claims to\nknowledge, on the other hand, we are on firmer ground, for the Mohists\npresent an explicit, though sketchy, theory based on the concept of\n fa (models, standards).  In outline, the\ntheory is this. To make a judgment is to distinguish what is\n\u201cthis\u201d or \u201cright\u201d (shi, or\n\u201cshr\u201d) in some context from what is \u201cnot\u201d or\n\u201cwrong\u201d (fei, \u201cfey\u201d). The process of\nevaluating whether some statement or action is correct is thus one of\nevaluating whether the distinction on which it is based is has been\ndrawn properly. To guide us in getting the distinctions right, the\nMohists propose that we should establish fa as standards or\ncriteria: What matches the fa is \u201cthis,\u201d and thus\ncorrect; what doesn\u2019t is \u201cnot.\u201d The fa can thus\nbe applied to justify or check knowledge claims. Conformity to\nthe fa provides good grounds for accepting a claim,\nnon-conformity for rejecting it. \n\n\nThe Mohists propose three fa for \u201cstatements\u201d or\n\u201csayings\u201d (yan), by which \u201cthe distinctions\nbetween \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018not\u2019 and benefit and\nharm...can be clearly known\u201d (Book 35, \u201cCondemning\nFatalism\u201d). Three slightly different versions of this doctrine\nare found in the Mozi, one in each of the three denunciations\nof fatalism (books 35\u201337). For brevity, we will discuss only the\nfirst\n version.[10]\n\n\nThe three fa are that statements must have a root,\na source, and a use. The \u201croot\u201d is the\nhistorical precedent and evidence provided by the deeds of the ancient\nsage kings, moral exemplars who reliably distinguished right from\nwrong correctly and whose way we thus seek to follow. The\n\u201csource\u201d is that statements must have an empirical basis;\nthey must be checked against what people see and hear. The\n\u201cuse\u201d is that when adopted as a basis for punishment and\ngovernment administration, the statement must produce benefit\n(l\u00ec) for the state, clan, and people.\n\n\nThe Mohists regularly appeal to these three criteria when\njustifying their core doctrines. When questions of existence are at\nstake, as when arguing for the existence of ghosts or the nonexistence\nof fate, they apply all three standards. In arguing against fatalism,\nfor example, they contend that (1) historical examples show that\nsecurity and order depend on government policy, not fate: the ancient\nsage kings achieved peace and security under the same social conditions\nin which the tyrants brought turmoil and danger. (2) No one has ever\nactually seen or heard fate. (3) Fatalism has detrimental social\nconsequences: If people listen to the fatalists, they will devote no\neffort to being virtuous or industrious. (Oddly, the Mohists overlook\nthe obvious fatalist rejoinders that the tyrants\u2019 failure and sages\u2019\nsuccess were predestined, that fate is not a physical object, and that\nsome people are fated to be diligent, others not.) Similarly, in\narguing for the existence of ghosts and spirits who reward the good and\npunish the wicked, the Mohists point out that (1) the sage kings all\nvenerated the ghosts and spirits; (2) countless well-known stories\nreport cases in which ghosts have been seen and heard; and (3) the\nteaching that ghosts and spirits reward the worthy and punish the\nwicked has beneficial social consequences, as fear of punishment will\ndeter people from wrongdoing.\n\n\nIn contexts where empirical support is irrelevant, only the first\nand third standards are applied. In condemning elaborate musical shows,\nfor instance, the writers contend that levying taxes to pay for\nexpensive musical instruments contradicts the deeds of the sage-kings, who\nwould tax the people only to pay for practical items such as boats and\ncarts, which benefit everyone. Grand concerts and feasts are pleasant,\nbut on balance they do not benefit the populace, since they interfere\nwith work and waste resources that could otherwise be devoted to food\nand clothing.\n\n\nHow are the three fa themselves justified? The texts that\npresent the theory do not say, but the Mohists probably view the third\nstandard, benefit to society, as an application of their moral theory,\nwhich they justify by appeal to the model of Heaven, or nature. That\nappeal they might justify in turn by independent moral criteria such\nas impartiality, benevolence, and reliability, as we suggested briefly\nin the section on\n objective standards.\n Critics who reject the Mohist normative theory thus may find\nthis fa objectionable as well. As to the second standard,\nwhat people see and hear, the Mohists offer no defense. They may have\nan inchoate theory of sense perception that explains why the second\nstandard is reliable, but there is little or no discussion of such\nissues in early Mohist texts.  The first standard reflects a shared\npattern, in the Mohists\u2019 intellectual milieu, of appealing to ancient\nsage-kings or culture heroes for authority. This habit was grounded in\nthe assumption that the ancient sage-kings were dependable ethical\nexemplars and, in some cases, that they were the originators of the\nrelevant normative practices. Such appeals are to some extent\ndefensible, as they can be thought of as an appeal to experience\n\u2014 to norms and practices that were found ethically and\npractically satisfactory by wise, fair leaders in the past. Still,\nlater Warring States thinkers will rightly question whether policies\ndeveloped under ancient social conditions remain applicable today and\nwhether we can even be sure what those policies were.\n\n\nConcerns can be raised about the vagueness of the three standards,\nthe potential for disagreement about their interpretation and\napplication, and the extent to which the Mohists apply them fairly and\nrigorously (does belief in ghosts really satisfy the second and third\nstandards?). Moreover, the Mohists seem to overlook the possibility of\nconflicts between the three, such as the likelihood that certain\npractices of the ancient sage-kings might not benefit society today.\nThe third standard probably takes priority over the others, since the\nfirst stipulates only that we find some \u201croot\u201d in the (presumably\nbenevolent) deeds of the sages, not that we imitate them slavishly, and\nsince, in a remarkable passage in Book 31 (\u201cElucidating Ghosts\u201d), Mozi\nis depicted as arguing that even if there really are no ghosts and\nspirits, we should still behave as if there are, because of the social\nbenefit that ensues.\n\n\nThe priority of the third standard is a striking feature of the Mohist\ntheory, for it entails that in at least some circumstances, they\nadvocate applying a utilitarian criterion to resolve not only\nnormative questions but descriptive ones as well. One explanation for\nthis extraordinary view is that they see all judgments \u2014\ndescriptive, prescriptive, or otherwise \u2014 as a matter of\ndistinguishing \u201cthis\u201d (shi) from\n\u201cnot\u201d (fei). They use this pair of pronouns to\nrefer to right and wrong in an extremely general sense, without\ndistinguishing between different notions of correctness and error as\nthey bear on describing, ordering, recommending, permitting, or\nchoosing, or on issues that to us fall into areas as diverse as\nscience, politics, ethics, prudence, and etiquette. We might say that\nthe Mohists are applying a very basic, primitive conception of\ncorrectness, of which truth, obligation, permissibility, and other\nnotions are species. The crucial point is probably that their main\ntheoretical focus is not descriptive truth, but the\nproper dao (way) by which to guide social and personal\nlife. This focus on dao leads them to run together the\nempirical question of whether ghosts exist with the normative question\nof whether we should act on and promulgate the teaching that they\ndo. The doctrine of the three models thus reflects the pragmatic\norientation of their thought, in particular the assumption, common to\nmany early Chinese thinkers, that the primary purpose of language and\njudgment is to guide action appropriately, rather than to describe\nfacts.\n\n\nThis pragmatic orientation led Hansen (1985, 1992) to propose that we\nshould not treat the Mohists (or other early Chinese theorists) as\naddressing the semantic issue of whether a claim is true, but the\npragmatic or normative one of whether a certain way of using words is\nappropriate. Thus the first standard, the deeds of the sage-kings,\nserves as a historical precedent of normatively correct usage, which\ncomplements the straightforwardly normative appeal to utility in the\nthird standard. Hansen suggests that in general we should avoid\ninterpreting early Chinese discussions about the proper way to\ndistinguish shi from fei as concerned with issues of\ntruth. (Hansen\u2019s view has been criticized by Graham 1989 and\nHarbsmeier 1998, among others. See Fraser 2020a for a critical discussion of both sides\u2019 positions.) Construed as the claim that the\nMohists are wholly unconcerned with or lack a concept corresponding to\nsemantic truth, Hansen\u2019s thesis is unconvincing, for classical Chinese\nnotions such as \u201cthis\u201d (shi), \u201cfitting\u201d\n(dang), and especially \u201cso\u201d (ran) play\nconceptual roles that overlap enough with that of semantic truth that\nearly Chinese thinkers cannot defensibly be said not to be\nconcerned with truth. Moreover, in recognizing the possibility that\nthere may really be no ghosts\u2014even when the statement that\nthere are purportedly satisfies the three standards\u2014the Mohists\nimplicitly recognize that a claim that is useful or satisfies our\ncriteria of correctness may yet be mistaken in the sense of falling\nshort of the \u201cfacts\u201d or \u201creality\u201d\n(qing). Arguably, they thus acknowledge a distinction between\nutility or social norms and semantic truth (though their discussion\nhere uses no word interpretable as \u201ctruth\u201d). Yet they\ncontend that even if ghosts really do not exist, the\nproper dao (way) is nevertheless to affirm that they\ndo\u2014a position that tends to support Hansen\u2019s view that they are\narguing primarily that we should promulgate and act on the teaching\nthat ghosts exist. Again, it\nis unlikely that early Mohist texts fully distinguish questions of\ndescriptive truth as a category separate from normative ethical or\npolitical questions. Their theoretical orientation tends to merge the\ntwo under the broader rubric of the proper dao by which to\ndiscriminate shi from fei. \n\n\nInterestingly, one could argue on the Mohists\u2019 own grounds that they\nshould give priority to the second standard over the other\ntwo\u2014or that they should explicitly distinguish descriptive from\nnormative issues\u2014since doing so would probably be more\nbeneficial in the long run. As rule of thumb, we probably benefit more\nby distinguishing shi from fei on empirical grounds,\nwhen relevant, rather than on the basis of historical precedent or\nshort-term utility. If ghosts and spirits indeed do not accord with\npeople\u2019s experience, for instance, then in the long run relying on\nfear of their wrath to deter crime will probably be less beneficial\nthan developing a reliable system of moral education and law\nenforcement. Also, in practice, it is unlikely that the alleged social\nbenefits could motivate doubters to sincerely act as if ghosts exist\nor to follow a moral code based partly on the existence of things they\ncannot experience.\n",
