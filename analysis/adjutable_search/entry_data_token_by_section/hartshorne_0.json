    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nCharles Hartshorne was born in the nineteenth century and lived to\nphilosophize in the twenty-first. He was born in Kittanning,\nPennsylvania (U.S.A.) on June 5, 1897. He was, like Alfred North\nWhitehead, the son of an Anglican minister, although many of his\nancestors were Quakers. After attending Haverford College he served in\nWorld War One in France as a medic, taking a box of philosophy books\nwith him to the front. After the war Hartshorne received his\nbachelor\u2019s degree and doctorate in philosophy at Harvard, and there he\nmet Whitehead. Most of the major elements of Hartshorne\u2019s\nphilosophy were already apparent by the time he became familiar with\nWhitehead\u2019s thought, contrary to a popular misconception. From\n1923\u20131925 a postdoctoral fellowship took him to Germany, where\nhe had classes with both Husserl and Heidegger. But neither of these\nthinkers influenced his philosophy as much as C.S. Peirce, whose\ncollected papers he edited with Paul Weiss. In addition to many\nvisiting appointments, Hartshorne spent his teaching career at three\ninstitutions. From 1928\u20131955 he taught at the University of\nChicago, where he was a dominant intellectual force in the School of\nDivinity, despite the fact that he was housed in the Philosophy\nDepartment, where he was not nearly as influential. He was at Emory\nUniversity from 1955 until 1962, when he moved to the University of\nTexas at Austin. Hartshorne eventually became a long-term emeritus\nprofessor at Austin and lived there until his death on October 9,\n2000. His wife, Dorothy, was as colorful as her husband and was\nmentioned often in his writings. Hartshorne never owned an automobile,\nnor did he smoke or drink alcohol or caffeine; he had a passion for\nbirdsong and became an internationally known expert in the field.\n",
