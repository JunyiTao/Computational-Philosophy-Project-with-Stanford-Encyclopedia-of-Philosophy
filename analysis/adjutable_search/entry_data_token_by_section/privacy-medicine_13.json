    "main_text": "Decisional Privacy\n5. Decisional Privacy\n\nIn medical contexts, \u201cprivacy\u201d is commonly used to denote\nautonomy, liberty or choice in health-related decision-making (Allen\n2014; DeCew 1997; Feinberg 1983). Patients\u2019 active participation\nin health-related decisions and control of their bodies\u2014without\nundue interference of government or unauthorized persons\u2014is a\ndecisional variant of the concept of privacy. Women are often ascribed\na \u201cprivacy right\u201d to use medically prescribed birth\ncontrol and to elect medically safe abortions. Men and women are\nascribed a \u201cprivacy right\u201d to utilize in vitro\nfertilization, surrogate gestators, and other reproductive\ntechnologies. Men and women with terminal illnesses or in vegetative\ncomas are ascribed a \u201cprivacy right\u201d to refuse\nlife-sustaining nutrition, respirators, and medical care (Beauchamp\n2000). Decisional privacy was problematically implicated in decisions\nwhether to self-isolate or wear a facial covering to avert the spread\nof COVID-19, and has come up in relation to other health-impacting\nlife-style decisions. \n\nDecisional uses of \u201cprivacy\u201d featured in this section are\ndisfavored by some philosophers. They view the term\n\u201cprivacy\u201d as more clearly and properly suited to\ninformational and physical uses, which they view as central,\nparadigmatic or core. On the other hand, the decisional use of privacy\nhas bona fide conceptual roots in Greek and Roman\nantiquity\u2019s public/private distinction, marking a boundary\nbetween affairs of politics and government (res publicae) and\naffairs of the household (re privatae). \n",
