    "main_text": "Governance || Institutional vs. Character-Centered Theories of Governance\n6.2 Institutional vs. Character-Centered Theories of Governance\n\nConfucian political thinkers in the Song-Ming period were preoccupied\nwith many other contentious issues in the affairs of state and often\nargued vehemently over the powers and responsibilities of specific\noffices, famine relief policies, state rituals, laws and punishments,\ntax and lending policies, and military and foreign affairs\n(JSL 8\u201310; MYDFL; ZZYL 108\u201314;\nZhu 2019: 56\u201371). Still, sometimes their disagreements about\nthese issues stemmed from deeper disagreements about the role of\nvirtue, talent, and institutional rules and incentives in effecting\ngood governance. When the Confucians turned to consider these issues\nexplicitly they often presented them as part of a debate about the\nrelative importance of \u201cinstitutional rules\u201d (fa\n\u6cd5) as compared with \u201cpeople\u201d (ren\n\u4eba) in good governance. In a well-known essay attributed to the\nclassical Confucian Xunzi, the author framed this question in exactly\nthose terms, arguing that good governance depends largely and more\nfundamentally on getting the right people, by which he meant people of\ntalent and virtue. The chapter sums up this position in the succinct\nand memorable claim that \u201cthere are people who create order but\nno rules that create order\u201d (Xunzi 12/57/3 [117]).\n\nMost of the explicit debate about this issue was taken up after a\nseries of attempts at dramatic reform at the tail end of the Northern\nSong associated with Wang Anshi and his successors. However\nwell-conceived those reforms may have been in their own right, they\ncoincided with a disastrous famine resulting in widespread debt and\ndislocation, and the last round of major reforms took place shortly\nbefore the Northern Song fell to Jurchen invaders. With that national\nanguish and humiliation serving as historical background for a great\ndeal of political thought in the subsequent Southern Song, many\npolitical thinkers blamed the very attempt to improve governance\nthrough mere reform (rather than concomitant improvements in\ncharacter) for the Northern Song\u2019s downfall. Accordingly, most\npolitical thinkers were attracted to Xunzi\u2019s position on the\nquestion of the relative importance of people (of good character)\nversus institutional rules. Zhu Xi articulates a version of this\nconsensus position in some recorded remarks to his students:\n\n\nThis age suffers from two defects: defects in its institutional rules\n(fa) and defects in the current political situation. The\ndefects in the rules can all be altered at once quite easily, but the\ndefects in the current political situation all reside in people. How\ncan they be changed when people go about their business with a selfish\nheartmind! The rules of the last eight years of Emperor\nRenzong\u2019s reign can be considered defective. Wang Anshi changed\nthem all soon after [becoming the emperor\u2019s prime minister], but\nthis only gave rise to numerous new defects. This is because people\nare hard to change. (ZZYL 108:2688; translation slightly\nmodified from Zhu 2019: 62)\n\n\nThe view propounded by Zhu Xi and other character-centered theorists\nlike Hu Hong seemed to allow that both decent institutional rules and\nvirtuous state officials were required for good governance. But once\nthe rules were decent, Zhu suggested, one could not expect to make\nfurther progress without improvements in character to ensure better\nimplementation. Both Zhu Xi and Hu Hong also seemed to be struck by\nthe idea that institutional rules have little causal responsibility in\ntheir own right and that it is much more to the credit and good\njudgment of virtuous people that they are used to good effect (Tiwald\n2019).\n\nAlthough the more character-centered view was generally more widely\naccepted by the most influential Song-Ming Confucians, there were some\nnotable defenders of the position that institutional reforms alone\ncould make improvements in governance. Two of these were the famous\nYongjia Confucians noted in\n section 2.5,\n Chen Liang and Ye Shi. These two sought ways of improving the\noutcomes of policy and institutional changes without requiring more\naltruistic motives of people, and to some extent sought to redefine\ntraditional virtues so that they could be more compatible with\nself-interest (Niu 1998; Tillman 1982). Another was the daring\npolitical reformer Huang Zongxi, who argued for institutional\npractices that continued to call for relatively good leaders but also\ncreated incentives to do some of the work that otherwise depended on\nthe exceptional good will and conscientiousness of the emperor or\nstate officials (Tiwald 2019: 86\u201392). Among other things, he\nproposed a stronger and more independent office of the prime minister\nor grand councilor, a rotational draft system for lower-level\nofficials, and a requirement that the emperor attend academy debates\nin which local representatives could express their opinions relatively\nfreely (MYDFL).\n",
