    "main_text": "Deceptionism vs. Non-Deceptionism About Lying || Complex Deceptionism\n2.2 Complex Deceptionism\n\n\nComplex Deceptionists hold that, in addition to requiring an intention\nto deceive, lying requires the making of an untruthful\nassertion, as well as (or which therefore entails) a\nbreach of trust or faith. Roderick Chisholm and\nThomas Feehan hold that one is only making an assertion to another\nperson if one makes a statement to another person and one believes\nthat the conditions are such that the other person is\njustified in believing both that one believes\none\u2019s statement to be true and that one intends that\nthe other person believe that one believes one\u2019s\nstatement to be true: \u201cx asserts p to y\n=df x states p to y and does so under\nconditions which, he believes, justify y in believing that he,\nx, not only accepts p, but also intends to contribute\ncausally to y\u2019s believing that he, x, accepts\np\u201d (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 152).\n \n\n\nA lie is an untruthful assertion, that is, the speaker believes the\nstatement that is made is not true, or is false:\n\nx lies to y =df There is a proposition\np such that (i) either x believes that p is\nnot true or x believes that p is false and (ii)\nx asserts p to y. (Chisholm and Feehan\n1977, 152)\nIn the case of a lie, the speaker is attempting to get the hearer\nto believe a falsehood. Note, however, that this falsehood is not\n(normally) what the speaker is stating. Rather, the falsehood that the\nspeaker is attempting to get the hearer to believe is that the\nspeaker believes the statement to be true. This is the intention\nto deceive in lying (although, strictly speaking, deception is\nforeseen and not intended (\u201cEssentially, under\nthis definition, you are only lying if you expect that you will be\nsuccessful in deceiving someone about what you believe\u201d (Fallis\n2009, 45)).\n\n\nThe speaker is also attempting to get the hearer to have this false\nbelief about what the speaker believes \u201cin a special\nway\u2014by getting his victim to place his faith in him\u201d\n(Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 149). This is the breach of trust or breach of faith\nin lying: \u201cLying, unlike the other types of deception, is\nessentially a breach of faith\u201d (Chisholm and Feehan 1977,\n153). Their complete definition of a lie may be stated as follows:\n\n(L6)\nTo lie =df to (i) make a believed-false or\nbelieved-not-true statement to another person; (ii) believe that the\nconditions are such that the other person is justified in believing\nthat the statement is believed to be true by the person making the\nstatement; (iii) believe that the conditions are such that the other\nperson is justified in believing that the person making the statement\nintends to contribute causally to the other person believing that the\nstatement is believed to be true by the person making the statement.\n(Chisholm and Feehan 1977; cf. Guenin 2005)\n\n\n\nAccording to L6 it not possible to lie if the speaker believes that\nthe conditions are such that the hearer is not justified in\nbelieving that the speaker is making a truthful statement. Kant\nprovides an example in which a thief grabs a victim by the throat and\nasks him where he keeps his money. If the victim were to make the\nuntruthful statement, \u201cI have no money,\u201d Kant says that\nthis is not a lie, \u201cfor the other knows that\u2026 he\nalso has no right whatever to demand the truth from me\u201d (Kant\n1997, 203; but see Mahon 2009). Chisholm and Feehan hold that the\nvictim is not making an assertion, and hence, is not lying, given that\nthe victim believes that the thief is not justified in believing that\nthe victim is being truthful (Chisholm and Feehan 1977, 154\u2013155; but\nsee Strudler 2009 (cf. Strudler 2005; 2010), for the argument that the\nthief can believe that the victim is credible, even if not trustworthy,\nbecause he is motivated by the threat of violence). \n\n\nCharles Fried also holds that lying requires an assertion and a\nbreach of faith, but he rejects L6, arguing that it is possible for the\nvictim to lie to the thief in Kant\u2019s example (Fried 1978, 55 n1).\nAccording to him, making an assertion involves making a statement and\nintending to cause belief in the truth of that statement by giving an\nimplicit \u201cwarranty\u201dor an implicit \u201cpromise\nor assurance that the statement is true\u201d (Fried 1978, 57). When\none asserts, one intends to \u201cinvite belief, and not belief based\non the evidence of the statement so much as on the\nfaith of the statement\u201d (Fried 1978, 56). A lie is an\nuntruthful assertion. The speaker intends to cause belief in the truth\nof a statement that the speaker believes to be false. Hence, a lie\ninvolves an intention to deceive. The speaker also implicitly assures or\npromises the hearer that the statement that is made is true. Hence, the\nspeaker is giving an insincere assurance, or breaking a promise\u2014\n\u201cin lying the promise is made and broken at the same\nmoment\u201d\u2014 and every lie involves a\n\u201cbreach of trust\u201d (Fried 1978, 67).\n\n\nFried\u2019s definition of lying may be stated as follows (modified\nto include cases in which speakers only intend to deceive about their\nbeliefs):\n\n(L7)\nTo lie =df to (i) make a believed-false statement to\nanother person; (ii) intend that that other person believe that the\nstatement is true [and that the statement is believed to be true] [or\nintend that the other person believe that the statement is believed to\nbe true]; (iii) implicitly assure the other person that the statement\nis true; (iv) intend that that other person believe that the statement\nis true [and that the statement is believed to be true] [or intend that\nthe other person believe that the statement is believed to be true]\non the basis of this implicit assurance. (Fried\n1978)\n\n\n\nDavid Simpson also holds that lying requires an assertion and a\nbreach of faith. In asserting \u201cwe present ourselves as believing\nsomething while and through invoking (although not necessarily gaining)\nthe trust of the one\u201d to whom we assert (Simpson 1992, 625). This\n\u201cinvocation of trust occurs through an act of \u2018open\nsincerity\u2019\u201d according to which \u201cwe attempt to\nestablish\u2026 both that we believe some proposition and that we\nintend them to realize that we believe it\u201d (Simpson 1992, 625).\nLying is \u201cinsincere assertion\u201d in the sense that \u201cthe\nasserter\u2019s requisite belief is missing\u201d (Simpson 1992,\n625). This entails that someone who lies aims to deceive in three ways.\nFirst, \u201cwe have the intention that someone be in error regarding\nsome matter, as we see the fact of the matter\u201d (Simpson 1992,\n624). This is the \u201cprimary deceptive intention\u201d (Simpson\n1992, 624). Second, we intend to deceive the other person\n\u201cregarding our belief regarding that matter\u2026 We\ndon\u2019t lie about this belief, but we intend to deceive\nregarding it\u201d (Simpson 1992, 624). We intend that they\nbe deceived, about whatever matter it is, on the basis of their being\ndeceived about our belief in this matter. Finally, someone who lies\n\u201cinsincerely invokes trust\u201d (Simpson 1992, 625). We intend\nthat they be deceived about our belief in this matter on the basis of\nthis insincere invocation of trust. Other forms of intended deception\nthat are not lies do not attempt to deceive \u201cby way of a trust\ninvoked through an open sincerity\u201d (Simpson 1992, 626). This is\nwhat makes lies special: \u201cit involves a certain sort of\nbetrayal\u201d (Simpson 1992, 626). \n\n\nSince it is possible to lie without having the primary deceptive\nintention, Simpson\u2019s definition needs to be modified\naccordingly:\n\n(L8)\nTo lie =df to: (i) make a statement to another\nperson; (ii) lack belief in the truth of the statement; (iii) intend\nthat the other person believe: (a) that the statement is true and that\nthe statement is believed to be true [or (b) that the statement is\nbelieved to be true]; (iv) intend that the other person believe: (c)\nthat it is intended that the other person believe that the statement is\ntrue; (d) that it is intended that the other person believe that the\nstatement is believed to be true; (v) invoke trust in the other person\nthat the statement is believed to be true by means of an act of\n\u2018open sincerity\u2019; (vi) intend that the other person\nbelieve (a), or (b), on the basis of (v). (Simpson 1992)\n\n\n\nPaul Faulkner holds that lying necessarily involves telling someone\nsomething, which necessarily involves invoking trust. He distinguishes\nbetween telling and making an assertion, and argues that in certain\ncases the implication of my assertion \u201cis sufficiently clear\nthat I can be said to have told you this\u201d (Faulkner 2013, 3102)\neven if I did not assert this. He defines telling as\nfollows: \u201cx tells y that p if and only if\n(i) x intends that y believe that p, and\n(ii) x intends that y believe that p\nbecause y recognizes that (i)\u201d (Faulkner 2013, 3103). In\ntelling another person something, the speaker intends that the hearer\nbelieve what she is stating or implying, but she intends that the\nhearer believe what she is stating or implying for the reason\nthat \u201cy [the hearer] believes x [the\nspeaker]\u201d (Faulkner 2013, 3102). It follows that tellings\n\u201coperate by invoking an audience\u2019s trust\u201d (Faulkner\n2013, 3103). In lying, the speaker intends that the hearer believe\nwhat she is stating or implying on the basis of trust: \u201cIn\nlying, a speaker does not intend his audience accept his lie because\nof independent evidence but intends his audience accept his\nlie because of his telling it. The motivation for presenting\nhis assertion as sincere is to thereby ensure that an audience treats\nhis intention that the audience believe that p as a reason for\nbelieving that p\u201d (Faulkner, 2007, 527) A lie is\nan untruthful telling. The speaker believes that what she asserts or\nimplies is false, she intends that the hearer believe that what she\nstates or implies is true, she intends that the hearer believe that\nshe intends this, and she intends that this be the reason\nthat the hearer believes that what she states or implies is true:\n\u201cx\u2019s utterance U to y is a lie if and\nonly if (i) in uttering U, x tells y\nthat p, and (ii) x believes that p is\nfalse\u201d (Faulkner 2013, 3103).\n\n\nFaulkner\u2019s definition of lying also needs to be modified to\ninclude cases in which speakers only intend to deceive about their\nbeliefs:\n\n(L9)\nTo lie =df to (i) utter some proposition to another\nperson; (ii) believe that the proposition is false; (iii) intend that\nthe other person believe that the proposition is true and is believed\nto be true [or intend that the other person believe that the\nproposition is believed to be true]; (iv) intend that the other person\nbelieve that it is intended that the other person believe that the\nproposition is true; (v) intend that the other person believe that the\nproposition is true and is believed to be true [or intend that the\nother person believe that the proposition is believed to be true] for\nthe reason that it is intended that the other person believe that the\nproposition is true. (Faulkner 2007; 2013)\n\n It is an implication of Complex Deceptionist definitions of lying\nthat certain cases of putative lies are not lies because no assertion\nis made. Consider the following case of an (attempted) confidence\ntrick double bluff (Newey 1997, 98). Sarah, with collaborator Charlie,\nwants to play a confidence trick on Andrew. She wants Andrew to buy\nshares in Cadbury.  She decides to deceive Andrew into thinking that\nKraft is planning a takeover bid for Cadbury. Sarah knows that Andrew\ndistrusts her. If she tells him that Kraft is planning a takeover bid\nfor Cadbury, he will not believe her. If she tells him that there is\nno takeover bid, in an (attempted) double bluff, he might believe the\nopposite of what she says, and so be deceived. But this simple double\nbluff is too risky on its own. So Sarah gets Charlie, whom Andrew\ntrusts, to lie to him that Kraft is about to launch a takeover bid for\nCadbury. She also gets Charlie to tell Andrew that she believes that\nit is false that Kraft is about to launch a takeover bid for\nCadbury. Sarah then goes to Andrew, and tells him, \u201cKraft is\nabout to launch a takeover bid for Cadbury.\u201d She does not intend\nthat Andrew believe that she believes that Kraft is about to launch a\ntakeover bid for Cadbury.  However, she intends that he believe that\nshe is mistaken, and that in fact Kraft is about to launch a takeover\nbid for Cadbury. As a result, he will be deceived.\n\n\nAccording to L6, L7, L8, and L9, Sarah is not lying, because she is\nnot asserting anything. According to Simpson, for example, Sarah would\nonly be \u201cpretending to invoke trust\u201d (Simpson\n1992, 628), and would not be invoking trust. In such a case, the\nspeaker intends to represent himself as \u201cintending to\nrepresent himself as believing what he does not\u201d (Simpson\n1992, 628). In order to lie, \u201cone must pretend sincerity, but\nalso act on an intention that this sincerity be\naccepted\u2014otherwise one is pretending to lie, and not\nlying\u201d (Simpson 1992, 629). Sarah would be merely pretending to\nlie to Andrew, in order to deceive him.\n\n\nAnother case of a putative lie that is not a lie according to Complex\nDeceptionist definitions of lying is a triple bluff\n(cf. Faulkner 2007, 527). Imagine an even more devious Pavel, from the\nexample above, telling an openly distrustful Trofim, in response to\nTrofim's question, that he is going to \u201cPinsk.\u201d He is\nactually going to Minsk, but he answers\u201cPinsk\u201d in order to\nhave Trofim believe that he is attempting a double bluff. If it works,\nTrofim will respond by telling him \u201cLiar! You say you are going\nto Pinsk in order to make me believe you are going to Minsk. But I\nknow you are going to Pinsk.\u201d According to L6, L7, L8, and L9,\nPavel is not lying to Trofim. He is pretending to attempt to deceive\nhim with a double bluff, in order to actually attempt to deceive him\nwith a triple bluff. At no point is he invoking trust, and breaching\nthat trust.\n",
