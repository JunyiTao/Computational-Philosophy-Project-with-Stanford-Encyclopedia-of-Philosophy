    "main_text": "Current Issues || Generalizing Expected Utility\n3.5 Generalizing Expected Utility\n\nProblems such as Pascal\u2019s Wager and the St. Petersburg paradox\nsuggest that decision theory needs a means of handling infinite\nutilities and expected utilities. Suppose that an option\u2019s\npossible outcomes all have finite utilities. Nonetheless, if those\nutilities are infinitely many and unbounded, then the option\u2019s\nexpected utility may be infinite. Alan H\u00e1jek and Harris Nover\n(2006) also show that the option may have no expected utility. The\norder of possible outcomes, which is arbitrary, may affect convergence\nof their utilities\u2019 probability-weighted average and the value\nto which the average converges if it does converge. Causal decision\ntheory should generalize its principle of expected-utility\nmaximization to handle such cases.\n\nAlso, common principles of causal decision theory advance standards of\nrationality that are too demanding to apply to humans. They are\nstandards for ideal agents in ideal circumstances (a precise\nformulation of the idealizations may vary from theorist to theorist).\nMaking causal decision theory realistic requires relaxing\nidealizations that its principles assume. A generalization of the\nprinciple of expected-utility maximization, for example, may relax\nidealizations to accommodate limited cognitive abilities. Weirich\n(2004) and Pollock (2006) take steps in this direction. Appropriate\ngeneralizations distinguish taking maximization of expected utility as\na procedure for making a decision and taking it as a standard for\nevaluating a decision even after the decision has been made.\n",
