    "main_text": "Bolzano\u2019s logic of variation || Relations among several propositions with variable parts\n6.3 Relations among several propositions with variable parts\n\nIn contemporary treatments of logic, logical relations between\nformulas of a formal language are sometimes defined in terms of\nrelations between sets of interpretations of the language. For\nexample, a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) might be said to imply\na formula \\(\\alpha\\) iff the set of interpretations making all members\nof \\(\\Gamma\\) true is a subset of the set of interpretations\nmaking \\(\\alpha\\) true, while \\(\\Gamma\\) itself might be said to be\nsatisfiable iff the set of interpretations making all its\nmembers true is non-empty.\n\nBolzano\u2019s system of extensional relations between propositions\nwith variable ideas is motivated by similar thoughts, though it is\ncast in terms of the extensions of ideas, propositions, and variable\nideas within them. The key notion is that of a collection of ideas\n\\(i\u2019, j\u2019, k\u2019, \\ldots\\) which, when substituted for\nthe variable ideas \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) in propositions \\(A, B, C,\n\\ldots\\), results in a collection of propositions all of which are\ntrue. (More loosely, Bolzano speaks of \u201ccollections of ideas\nwhose substitution for \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\), makes all of \\(A, B, C,\n\\ldots\\) true\u201d (TS II: \u00a7155, 114, 122, and\n\u00a7156, 133).) We will call such collections of ideas \\(i\u2019,\nj\u2019, k\u2019, \\ldots\\) verifying ideas for \\(A, B, C,\n\\ldots\\) relative to the variable ideas \\(i, j, k, \\ldots.\\)\n\nIn a crucial passage, Bolzano sets up the correspondence he needs to\ncarry out his plan:\n\n\nWith ideas, the crucial question was whether or not a certain object\nis indeed represented by them; the corresponding question for\npropositions is whether or not they are true. Just as I have called\nideas compatible or incompatible with each other, depending on whether\nor not they have certain objects in common, so I call propositions\ncompatible or incompatible, depending on whether or not there are\ncertain ideas which make all of them true. (TS II: \u00a7154,\n101; Bolzano 1973: 198\u2013199)\n\n\nThat is, just as ideas \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are said to be\ncompatible iff at least one object stands under each of \\(A,\nB, C, \\ldots\\), so too we can say that propositions \\(A, B,\nC, \\ldots\\) are compatible with respect to variable ideas \\(i, j, k,\n\\ldots\\) iff there is at least one collection of ideas \\(i\u2019,\nj\u2019, k\u2019, \\ldots\\) which are verifying ideas for each of\n\\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\). Equivalently, \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are compatible\nrelative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) iff the ideas [verifying\nideas for \\(A\\) relative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)], [verifying ideas for\n\\(B\\) relative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)], [verifying ideas for \\(C\\)\nrelative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)] are compatible in the previously\ndefined sense; otherwise, they are said to be incompatible.\n\nFor example, the propositions [Wellington predeceased Napoleon] and\n[Napoleon predeceased Wellington] are incompatible when all\noccurrences of [Napoleon] and [Wellington] are considered uniformly\nvariable, but compatible when [predeceased] is varied in both\npropositions, since the substitution [fought] for [predeceased]\nproduces two true propositions. (Here, we have to do with the forms\n\u2018 \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) predeceased \\(\\mathbf{B}\\)\u2019 and \u2018\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) predeceased \\(\\mathbf{A}\\)\u2019 in the first case,\nand \u2018Napoleon R Wellington\u2019 and \u2018Wellington\nR Napoleon\u2019 in the second.)\n\nNext, propositions \\(M, N, O, \\ldots\\) are said to be\ndeducible from propositions \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) with respect\nto variable ideas \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) iff \\(A, B, C, \\ldots, M, N, O,\n\\ldots\\) are compatible with respect to variable ideas \\(i, j, k,\n\\ldots\\) and the idea [verifying ideas for \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\)\nrelative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)] is included in the idea [verifying\nideas for \\(M, N, O, \\ldots\\) relative to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)] in the\npreviously defined sense, i.e., iff the extension of the former is a\nsubset of the extension of the latter (TS, \u00a7 155). \n\nIn the shorter version of his logic, Bolzano states this definition as\nfollows:\n\n\nIf one or more propositions \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are compatible with\none or more others \\(M, N, \\ldots\\) with respect to the components\n\\(i, j, \\ldots\\), then there must be, as just said, at least some\nideas that, when put in the places of \\(i, j, \\ldots\\) make all of\n\\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) as well as all of \\(M, N, \\ldots\\) true. One\nespecially noteworthy case occurs, however, if not just some, but\nall of the ideas that, when substituted for \\(i, j, \\ldots\\)\nin \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) make all these true, also make all of \\(M, N,\n\\ldots\\) true. In this case I say that the propositions \\(M, N,\n\\ldots\\) stand in the relation of deducibility to the\npropositions \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) with respect to the variable parts\n\\(i, j, \\ldots\\) (Bolzano 2004a: 54), \n\n\n\u2014giving the following examples: [All \\(i\\) are \\(k\\)] is\ndeducible from [All \\(i\\) are \\(j\\)] and [All \\(j\\) are \\(k\\)] , and\n[\\(\\angle ijk = \\angle ikj\\)] is deducible from [\\(i, j, k\\) are the\nthree vertices of a triangle] and [\\(\\overline{ij}\\) =\n\\(\\overline{ik}\\)], in both cases with respect to \\(i, j, k\\).\n\nProceeding in this way through his table of relations among ideas,\nBolzano obtains at one stroke a complete system of extensional\nrelations between propositions, relative to certain of their parts\nconsidered variable (in other words, between propositional\nforms in the sense of classes of propositions). The\nresult is a genealogical tree whose fundamental structure is exactly\nthe same as the structure of the tree representing the relations\nbetween ideas. In most cases, he uses the same terms, speaking of\ncompatibility, deducibility (inclusion), subordination (unilateral\ndeducibility), equivalence (mutual deducibility), overlapping,\ncontrariety, and contradiction among propositions. \n\nTo obtain a clearer overview of these relations, let us introduce some\nnotation and once again use the language of set theory. We will use\nbold letters to symbolize sets of items (propositions or variable\nideas). Thus, for instance, \u2018\\(\\mathbf{A(i)}\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(\\mathbf{M(i)}\\)\u2019 will be used to represent sets of\npropositions \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\{A, B, C, \\ldots\\}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{M}=\\{M,\nN, O, \\ldots\\}\\) in which the ideas \\(\\mathbf{i}=i, j, k, \\ldots\\) are\nconsidered variable. Let \\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))}\\) represent the set of\nverifying ideas for \\(\\mathbf{A(i)}\\). Finally, let \\(\\mathbf{\\neg\nA}\\) represent \\(\\{\\neg A, \\neg B, \\neg C, \\ldots\\}\\). We then\nhave:\n\n\nA is compatible with M with respect\nto variable ideas i:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))} \\cap \\mathbf{V(M(i))} \\not= \\emptyset\\)\n\nA is incompatible with M with\nrespect to i:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))} \\cap \\mathbf{V(M(i))} = \\emptyset\\)\n\nM is deducible [ableitbar] from\nA with respect to i:\n\nA and M are compatible with respect\nto i and \\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))} \\subseteq\n\\mathbf{V(M(i))}\\).\n\nA is equivalent to M with respect to\ni:\n\nA is deducible from M and\nM is deducible from A, both with\nrespect to i, i.e., \\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))} \\not=\n\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\mathbf{V(A(i))} = \\mathbf{V(M(i))}\\).\n\nM is unilaterally deducible from A\nwith respect to i:\n\nM is deducible from but not equivalent to\nA with respect to i.\n\nA and M are contradictory with\nrespect to i:\n\n\\(\\neg\\mathbf{A}\\) is equivalent to M and\nA equivalent to \\(\\neg\\mathbf{M}\\), both with respect\nto i.\n\nA and M are contrary with respect to\ni:\n\nA and M are incompatible but not\ncontradictory with respect to i.\n Bolzano states and proves a substantial collection of theorems\nabout his relations, including the following:\n\n\nIf \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are incompatible with respect to\ni then any collection of propositions that contains\n\\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) is also incompatible with respect to\ni (TS,\u00a7154, no. 10).\nIf A is compatible with respect to \\(i, j,\n\\ldots\\), then it is also compatible w.r.t. any collection of variands\nthat contains \\(i, j, \\ldots \\) (\u00a7154, no. 11).\nIf \\(M\\) is deducible from \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) with respect to\n\\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) then \\(M\\) is also deducible from \\(A, B, C,\n\\ldots\\) relative to any sub-collection of \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\),\nprovided that \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are compatible relative to the\nsub-collection (\u00a7155, no. 19). \n\\(\\neg M\\) is deducible from A, a class of\ncompatible premises, iff A is incompatible with\nM (\u00a7155, nos. 14, 15).\nIf M is deducible from A, \\(X\\)\nas well as from A, \\(\\neg X\\), then\nM is deducible from A alone\n(\u00a7155, no. 17).\nIf all propositions deducible from the premises A\nare true, A is true (\u00a7155, no. 6).\n\n\nIf M is deducible from A, and\nX from M, R (both\nwith respect to \\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\)), then X is\ndeducible from A, R with respect to\n\\(i, j, k, \\ldots\\) (\u00a7155, no. 24).\n \n\n\n(\u00a7224, no. 2) If the inference: \\( \\begin{array}{l} A, B, C,\nD, E, F, G, \\ldots \\\\ \\hline M, N, O\\\\ \\end{array} \\)\n\n\nis valid, then so is: \\( \\begin{array}{l} A, B, C, D, \\ldots\\\\\n\\hline \\text{If } E, F, G, \\text{ are true, then so are } M, N, O\n\\ldots\\\\ \\end{array} \\) \n\n",
