    "main_text": "Philosophical Approaches || Foucauldian Analyses\n3.1 Foucauldian Analyses\n\nThe work of French philosopher Michel Foucault, especially its\npurchase in historicizing concepts and analyzing power, is trenchant\nin critical disability theory. This sub-section provides key examples\nof Foucauldian approaches in critical disability theory.\n\nFor example, Shelley Tremain\u2019s edited collection, Foucault\nand the Government of Disability (2005), brings together\ninterdisciplinary, international work on disability from a variety of\ntheorists who use Foucauldian approaches. In the introduction to that\nvolume, Tremain writes, \n\n\nThe collection is a response to Foucault\u2019s call to question what\nhas been regarded as natural, inevitable, ethical, and liberating;\nhence, contributions to this collection draw on Foucault in order to\nscrutinize a range of widely endorsed practices and ideas surrounding\ndisability, including rehabilitation, community care, impairment,\nnormality and abnormality, inclusion, prevention, genetic counseling,\naccommodation, and special education. (2005: 2\u20133). \n\n\nTremain argues that Foucault\u2019s concepts of biopower and the\nsubject are \u201cindispensable\u201d in the analysis of disability,\nwhich in turn relate to his central concepts of government, or the\nconduct of conduct, and liberalism. This implies that disability is\ncentral to both of these concepts (2005: 7).\n\nA Foucauldian approach follows through on efforts in critical\ndisability theory to challenge the distinction between impairment and\ndisability. Tremain argues that the social model, embedded in\ntraditional disability studies and in the thinking of U.K. activists,\nfails because it strongly distinguishes between impairment and\ndisability (2005: 9). For Tremain, impairment is not natural,\nvalue-neutral, and objective but rather is \u201chistorically\nspecific and performative\u201d (2017: 115, cf. 2005: 11). Along\nthese lines, Tremain works to undermine, defamiliarize, and\ndenaturalize terminology like \u201cpeople with disabilities\u201d,\nhierarchies of \u201cseverity\u201d among impairments, the\nterminology of impairment itself, and type or kind distinctions among\ndisabilities (e.g., physical or intellectual, among other similar\nterms) (2017). For her, impairment, like disability, is the product of\npower relations. Just as Judith Butler claims that sex is\nperformatively constituted through gender, Tremain leverages Foucault\nto make the same claim about the relationship between disability and\nimpairment (2017: 115, cf. Tremain 2001). She writes,\n\u201cimpairment has been disability\u2014or rather, an element of\nthe apparatus of disability\u2014all along\u201d (2017: 93). Indeed,\naccording to Tremain, we should not be surprised that impairment\nitself is historical as \u201cthe shifting limits and borders of the\nclassification of impairment demonstrate its historicity and cultural\nspecificity\u201d (2017: 93).\n\nTremain uses Foucault\u2019s theoretical approach to articulate a\nfeminist philosophy of disability. On this view disability is both\nrelative and historical (2017). Among other innovations, Tremain\nintroduces the concept of ableist exceptionism, which marks off\ndisability as a-political, even while philosophers and other theorists\nof all stripes thoroughly politicize and problematize other identity\ncategories (2017: 33\u201334). Along these lines, she analyzes work\nin feminist philosophy, philosophy, and the milieu of higher education\nfor its exclusions, which replicate the idea that disability is an\nindividual, biological matter (2017: 30).\n\nUse of Foucault varies within critical disability theory, and so there\nare other key Foucauldian contributions to thinking about disability.\nLicia Carlson uses a Foucauldian genealogy to construct a history of\nintellectual disability, demonstrating that intellectual disability is\ncontingent and constructed, and challenging long-standing beliefs in\nphilosophy and ethics about its meaning and implications (2009, see\nalso Carlson 2001). Nirmala Erevelles uses Foucault\u2019s treatment\nof Pierre Riviere to frame debate over facilitated communication used\nby autistic students; using this comparison, she leverages Foucault to\nsuggest that the human subject is fictional, therefore disrupting the\nquestion of whether or not a person considered mentally disabled can\nself-represent (2002). Aimi Hamraie, whose feminist work in critical\ndisability theory focuses on access, technology, and universal design\n(e.g., 2017), employs Foucault to outline a historical epistemological\napproach to disability (2015). Joshua St. Pierre, whose critical work\nfocuses on speech disabilities (2013, 2015a, 2015b), uses Foucault to\nsituate Speech-Language Pathology as a governing discourse intended to\nbring speech under biopower (St. Pierre & St. Pierre 2018). The use of Foucault in these contexts does not go without critique. For example, Bill Hughes argues against the use of Foucauldian analysis in disability theory\n(2005).\n\nCritical thinkers frequently use Foucault to assess, analyze, and\nreconsider topics in bio-medical ethics tightly connected to\ndisability. Catherine Mills critically intervenes in bioethics using a\nlargely Foucauldian approach, tackling topics such as reproduction,\ngenetic screening, and selective termination (2008, 2011, 2013,\n2015). Melinda C. Hall uses Foucault\u2019s genealogical and\nbiopolitical frameworks, including his concept of vile sovereignty, to\nreframe bioethical debate over human enhancement (2013, 2016). She\nargues that disability, the refusal of disabled futures, and the\nreduction of political and social questions to biological registers\nundergirds transhumanist desires to achieve posthumanity\n(2016). Marilou Gagnon, in the field of nursing, critically assesses\nseclusion rooms, public health campaigns, HIV, and telecare using\nFoucault\u2019s theoretical structure of sovereign power and\ngovernance (Gagnon, Jacob, & Holmes 2010; Gagnon & Stuart\n2008; Guta, Gagon, & Jacob 2012; and Jacob, Gagnon, Perron, &\nHolmes 2009).\n\nEllen Feder regularly employs a Foucauldian approach, especially using\nFoucault\u2019s concept of biopower, to intervene in bioethics\ndiscourse and make progress in analyzing the family, gender identity,\nintersex issues, race, and shame surrounding the body, all of which\nare of serious interest in critical disability theory (1997, 2000,\n2007, 2009, and 2014). Catherine Clune-Taylor uses Foucault to\ncritically examine and treat evolving understandings of intersex and\nsex development, intervening upon treatment protocols, conversion\ntherapy, and reductive understandings of evolution and gender (2010;\nsee also Clune-Taylor 2016). Alice Dreger, too, has employed Foucault\nto theorize intersex (1998). Feder has also used concepts derived from\nother Continental philosophers, including Bourdieu\u2019s habitus, to\nconsider the impact of normalization on parent-child relationships in\ncases where children present atypical genitalia (2006). Feder argues\nthat representations of sexual difference structure reality and become\npart of shared ideology, rendering it difficult to recognize evidence\nthat complicates common understandings of sexual difference (2006:\n191).\n\nFoucault\u2019s work, and so Foucauldian approaches, are a popular\nobject of the kind of critique Vehmas and Watson (2014) use to target\ncritical disability theory as a whole. Critics commonly suppose that\nFoucault lacks the necessary ground to make normative claims, as he\nrefuses to distinguish normatively among various forms of power (e.g.,\nFraser 1989: 31 and 33). Hall responds to this frequent critique,\nwriting, \n\n\nFoucault\u2019s refusal to engage in normative theorizing has\nnormative implications; it allows one to see what has been\nobfuscated\u2014for example, power\u2019s productive\nfunctions\u2014and thus reframe ethics by overthrowing previous\nnormative presuppositions. (M. Hall 2015: 162) \n\n\nIndeed, Foucault directly described his work as moral. In an\ninterview, Foucault said, \n\n\nIn a sense, I am a moralist, insofar as I believe that one of the\ntasks, one of the meanings of human existence\u2014the source of\nhuman freedom\u2014is never to accept anything as definitive,\nuntouchable, obvious or immobile. (Foucault 1988: 1, as quoted in M.\nHall 2015: 162)\n\n",
