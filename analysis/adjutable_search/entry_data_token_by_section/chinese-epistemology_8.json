    "main_text": "Classical Approaches || Neglecting Linguistic Positivism\n3.2 Neglecting Linguistic Positivism\n\nThe second basic approach can be seen as derived from the negation of\nthe two positions we have just described, or their common features\nand, in fact, denied the positivistic functions of language. This\napproach also contained two different epistemological currents: the\nfirst was pre-linguistic and had its main representative in Laozi (ca\n6th century BC), while the second current, which found its\nmost famous exponent in the Confucian Mengzi, argued that language was\nnot necessarily innate (Mengzi CTP: Gongsun Chou\nshang, 2.8, also see Hansen 1989: 110\u2013111). Their moral\nepistemology was equally based solely upon introspection.\n\nHowever, while Laozi represented a current that could be defined as\npre-linguistic, and though the Daoist school differed from many of the\nbasic premises of Mengzi\u2019s teachings, Laozi\u2019s negation of\nlanguage closely resembles that of Mengzi. While Laozi suggests that\nthe natural behavior generated by our natural constitution requires\nthe abandonment of language, it is hardly coincidental that the\ndeclarative Confucian, Mengzi never mentions the Proper names\ndiscourse, which occupies such an important position in the\nAnalects. They both accept the action or behavior generated\nby the natural human constitution. Although they disagree on how rich\nand extensive these natural dispositions are, both scholars share the\ncommon belief that behavior should primarily be guided through their\nuse (Hansen 1989: 110\u2013111).\n\nWhile Laozi\u2019s dao cannot be contained or inscribed within any\nkind of linguistic structure, it still represents the basic cosmic and\nmoral force, creating and immanently governing everything that exists.\nHe viewed knowledge (in the sense of learning virtues) as a kind of\nsocial pressure which impeded our natural spontaneity (Laozi CTP: 18).\nIn Laozi\u2019s view, every linguistic concept is determined by time\nand space, and can therefore represent only a partial, incomplete\nexpression of reality, which he saw as integral, dynamic and\nholistically structured. Consequently, in order to preserve the\nnaturalness of our existence, we must withdraw from all conventions,\nincluding that of language itself. Laozi thus sought a radically\ndifferent process of comprehension: one of non-linguistic\nintrospection (Laozi CTP: 47).\n\nMengzi believed that the inborn qualities of human beings\n(xing \u6027) are naturally disposed towards the good. If\nindividuals are in touch with their true nature, their actions will\ninevitably tend towards the good (Allinson 1989: 17) without needing\nto rely on linguistic maxims. In this sense, he formulated the first\nanti-linguistic version of Confucian epistemology (Mengzi CTP: Wan\nzhang shang, 5; Jin xin shang, 1, 5, 15; Liang Hui wang shang, 6).\nWith this approach, he wanted both to refute one of the central tenets\nof Mohist theory, while also resolving (or avoiding) the central\nproblem of Confucian epistemology, i.e., the insertion of moral\nprinciples into behavior patterns through linguistic interpretations\n(Hansen 1989: 110).\n\nAccording to Chad Hansen (1989: 111), Mengzi did not view language as\nbeing an innate system which contained the essence of proper social\nnorms, and instead believed that all traditional Confucian conventions\nwere \u2018wired\u2019 into the human heart-mind (xin).\nHowever, this view has been challenged by other sinologists (e.g.,\nShun 1997; Van Norden 2000; Ivanhoe 2002), who have pointed out that\nonly the four \u2018sprouts\u2019 (si duan\n\u56db\u7aef) of essential moral qualities (Ivanhoe 2002: 43) were\ninnate to heart-mind, and that these had to be properly cultivated in\norder to enable human beings to comprehend the world and act in\naccordance with moral virtues (Lee 2018: 36\u20139). But given that proper\nnames (zheng ming) did not represent a system of (moral)\nrecognition for Mengzi, such cultivation was not based on a shared\nlinguistic system or consensus (Mengzi CTP: Jinxin shang,\n15). This position allowed him to formulate a series of well-grounded\narguments against the challenges presented by the Mohist school.\n",
