    "main_text": "The Significance of Past Wrongdoing || Carrying Out Acts of Symbolic Compensation in Fulfilling a Surviving Duty Towards the Dead Victims\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nArguments as developed in the ongoing debates on (the foundations of)\nintergenerational justice can help to justify several obligations of\ncurrently living people vis-\u00e0-vis future people and towards\npast people. Currently living people are obliged (i) not to violate\nthe rights of future generations\n (\u00a72)\n and (ii) (at least some presently living people might well be\n obliged)[23]\n to provide compensation to contemporaries with respect to harms\nvictims in the past suffered at the hands of past perpetrators\n (\u00a75).\n\nBy employing a threshold notion of harm which may be understood as a\ncentral element of a sufficientarian conception of intergenerational\njustice\n (\u00a74.4),\n but could also be an element of other substantive understandings of\nintergenerational justice\n (\u00a74.2\n and\n \u00a74.3),\n we can justify conclusions about both types of present\ngenerations\u2019 duties. Basic needs or central capabilities are\nplausible currencies of a sufficientarian interpretation of\nintergenerational justice that relies on the threshold notion of harm\n (\u00a74.1).\n The threshold notion of harm can be understood as a constitutive\nelement of a complex understanding of harm (disjunctive notion)\n (\u00a73,\n and, in particular,\n \u00a73.2).\n\nThe special features of our relations to (remote) future\npeople\u2014especially the lack of particular knowledge, the\nimpossibility of cooperation, and the permanent asymmetry of influence\n (\u00a71)\u2014do\n not stand in the way of attributing rights to them that ground\ncorresponding duties owed by us\n (\u00a72\n and\n \u00a73).\n The fact that past wrongs are among the necessary conditions for the\nexistence and identity of people currently alive is compatible with\nthe view that these persons have rights to compensation owing to the\nimpact of these past wrongs on their well-being, and that these rights\ncan ground corresponding duties owed by their contemporaries\n(forward-looking understanding of the significance of past injustices)\n (\u00a75.1).\n However, the Non-Identity Problem is not relevant for many indirect\nvictims\u2019 claims to compensation owing to past and historical\ninjustices\n (\u00a75.2).\n Even when we allow for the possibility of the ongoing impact of past\ninjustices to be just today, namely owing to changes of relevant\ncircumstances, we will have to investigate the extent to which the\nconditions for such a supersession of historical claims are met for\neach case. If supersession of historical claims occurs it might well\nbe partial and and for the time being, and not full and final\n (\u00a75.3).\n\nRights-based considerations of intergenerational justice bear not only\nupon \u201csame people choices\u201d but also upon both types of\n\u201cdifferent people choices\u201d that Parfit distinguishes,\nincluding what he calls \u201cdifferent number choices\u201d\n (\u00a72\n and\n \u00a73).\n However, widely shared concerns for the continuation of human life\nand at a high level of well-being cannot be accounted for solely by\nrights-based considerations\n (\u00a74.6).\n Also, the moral significance of past wrongs should not be interpreted\nsolely in terms of the impact of these injustices on present and\nfuture people\u2019s well-being. If we allow that intergenerational\nrelations are not exclusively governed by duties with correlative\nrights, the notion that we can stand under surviving duties towards\ndead people who cannot be bearers of rights vis-\u00e0-vis present\npeople\n (\u00a7\u00a75.4\u20135)\n is compatible with the forward-looking understanding of the\nsignificance of historical injustice. Also, the notion that we stand\nunder an obligation towards future people to which no rights of future\npeople correspond\u2014namely, under the obligation not to destroy\nwillfully the goods inherited from our predecessors and the conditions\nthat are constitutive of persons\u2019 pursuit of future-oriented\nprojects\n (\u00a74.6)\u2014is\n compatible with the view that we do stand under some obligations of\nintergenerational justice to which the rights of future people\ncorrespond.\n",
