    "main_text": "\n\nSimplicius of Cilicia (ca. 480\u2013560 CE), roughly a contemporary\nof John Philoponus, is without doubt the most important Neoplatonic\ncommentator on Aristotle and one of the two most influential exegetes\nwithin the Aristotelian tradition, along with Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(around 200 CE). Simplicius\u2019 works are an unmatched source for\nthe intellectual traditions that preceded him: Presocratic, Platonic,\nand especially the Peripatetic tradition. He is also an independent\nthinker in his own right, with a coherent philosophical agenda. Best\nknown for his tendency to harmonise Plato and Aristotle, he\nnevertheless criticised Aristotle on several occasions and considered\nhimself a loyal follower of Plato. Writing in an age when Christianity\nwas the dominant religious and political view, Simplicius aimed to\nshow that the Hellenic tradition is not only much older, but also more\nvenerable and more coherent than the Christian tradition. Unimpressed\nby charges of alleged contradictions among Greek philosophers,\nSimplicius repeatedly proclaimed that \u201cthe ancient wisdom\n(palaia philosophia) remains unrefuted\u201d (In\nPhys. 77.11). It is also noteworthy that, like Proclus and other\nNeoplatonists, Simplicius presents himself as a thinker for whom\nphilosophy and theology form a complete unity. As has frequently been\nobserved, Simplicius\u2019 works, despite their scholarly outlook,\nhave an important spiritual dimension (see\n \u00a75).\n\nSimplicius\u2019 commentaries have only recently been studied with an\neye to his own philosophical views. He was long considered a mere\nsource for Greek philosophy, and, as noted by Baltussen (2010: 714),\n\n\n\nSimplicius\u2019 importance as a source for ancient Greek philosophy\nand science has long overshadowed his contributions as an independent\nthinker. \n\n\nNineteenth-century Quellenforschung was especially interested\nin his Commentary on the Physics, which was edited in two\nvolumes (Simplicii in Aristotelis Physicorum libros quattuor\npriores/quattuor posteriores, comprising almost 1500 pages) by\nHermann Diels; this commentary served as the basis for Diels\u2019\nedition of the Doxographi Graeci (Greek\nDoxographers), which includes the main doctrines on natural\nphilosophy according to ancient doxographical compendia.\n\nOne of the aims of this entry is to emphasise that Simplicius\u2019\nwritings have much more to offer than a mere doxography of his\npredecessors\u2014but always bearing in mind that it is only possible\nto appreciate how Simplicius arranges and interprets the material at\nhis disposal by duly attending to his Neoplatonic agenda.\n",
