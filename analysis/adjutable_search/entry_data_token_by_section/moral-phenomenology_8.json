    "main_text": "Moral Phenomenology and Metaethics || Moral agency\n2.5 Moral agency\n\nOne Phenomenological view of the nature of moral agency derives from\nHusserl (1908\u20139/1911/1914 [1988: 107]) who calls the (implicit\nor explicit) volitional intention that initiates and governs an action\nthe fiat, the \u201clet it be done\u201d. The transition\nfrom the evaluation of the envisioned end as (apparently) good to the\nfiat is mediated by desire. The envisioned good disclosed by\nthe feeling or emotional apprehension is taken as desirable, and the\nfiat directs the agent to that desirable good as something to\nbe realized through a bodily performance. The fiat, in other\nwords, intends the envisioned good as realizable and is inseparable\nfrom the action that realizes (or attempts to realize) it (Melle 1997:\n180). At every moment of the action the volitional intention maintains\nitself both as a partially unfulfilled intention that is at the same\ntime partially fulfilled (Melle 1997: 181), and the action ordered\ntoward the satisfaction of the desire continues just so long as the\nfiat is operative.\n\nWilling is founded on and inseparable from desire, but it is not\nreducible to desire. Desiring is not willing insofar as it is not\nconstrained by practical modalities (e.g., possibility versus\nimpossibility) and it is not a determination to undertake an action. I\ncan wish for the impossible or for what is past (or both, as in\n\u201cI wish I did not have that second piece of pie at dinner last\nnight\u201d), and I can desire some future good but not wish to do\nwhat is required to obtain that good. Moreover, once one chooses to do\nA, and nothing interferes, one does A. We do not\nresist performing an action once we have willed it, but we do\nregularly resist some desires (Husserl 1908\u20139/1911/1914 [1988:\n103, 221\u2013224]; Melle 1997: 179; see also Bratman 2012: 73). The\nwishing that is relevant for the will and for action is a wishing for\nwhat is practically possible, what is realizable in action. This\nwishing takes the form of desire, and the volitional\nintention\u2014the fiat\u2014determines us to act.\n\nThe progressive completion of a volitional intention that initiates\nand controls a physical performance aimed at a desired end is a\nvoluntary action. On Ricoeur\u2019s view, the decision indicates a\npresent or future voluntary action which depends on me and which is\nwithin my power. But, as seen above, Ricoeur\u2019s position adopts a\nmeans-end conception of deliberation and action, and this masks an\nimportant distinction introduced by Husserl between two kinds of\nvolition, namely, the distinction between action-will\n[Handlungswille] and decision-will\n[Entschlu\u00dfwille]. Actions executing an action-will are\ninitiated by a desire for an end that is not explicitly\nintended in the willing. They involve no prior choice and manifest\nthemselves in the very performance of the\n action.[19]\n We shall call these voluntary actions. Actions executing a\ndecision-will, that is a prior choice or intention, are initiated by a\nchoice in the light of an end that is explicitly intended in\nthe\n willing.[20]\n We shall call these chosen actions. Chosen actions differ from\nvoluntary actions, then, in that they not only aim at a\ndesired end but are explicitly undertaken in the light of\nthat end. I might eat a chocolate sundae because, as a matter of\ndesire, I like sundaes, but I might choose to snack on a piece of\nfruit (rather than the sundae) for the sake of my health.\nEating the fruit is chosen as conducive to the end\n(Sokolowski 1985: 11; Drummond 2020a). In chosen action the agent\nwills that the action be done as conducing to an articulated\nend, whereas in merely voluntary action the agent wills that the\nobject of desire be realized by acting. While the outcome of\na merely voluntary action aiming at a particular end and that of a\nchosen action aiming at the same end might be the same, the\nintentional structures of the two volitional experiences and the\nactions undertaken to fulfill them differ.\n\nAlthough the early Husserl inherited an idealized utilitarianism from\nFranz Brentano, later in his career he favored a view that\n\u201cabsolute loves\u201d generate \u201cabsolute oughts\u201d\n(Husserl 1919\u201320 [2012: 146]; 1916\u201335 [2014:\n391\u2013392]). For example, a mother\u2019s love for her child\ndemands that she protect her child from harm even when sacrificing her\nchild is a lesser good for the aggregate and even when saving her\nchild leads to harm for others. The central idea is that an objective\nvalue can become an \u201cindividual, subjective value of\nlove\u201d, i.e., that \u201cthe same value can be infinitely more\n\u2018significant\u2019 for one person than another\u201d (Husserl\n1919\u201320 [2012: 146n.]). Such absolute loves\u2014we can also\nthink of them as commitments\u2014unconditionally bind that subject\nto honor those commitments regardless of what any purely objective,\nconsequentialist calculation might require (Husserl 1916\u201335\n[2014: 391\u2013392]). These commitments motivate an agent to adopt\nan ethical life-project and to undertake the actions necessary to\nrealize that project, a project that is \u201cthe deepest ground of\n[her] personal identity and individuality\u201d (Melle 1991: 131;\n2002:\n 243\u2013244).[21]\n This view is consistent with and an extension of \u201cweak\u201d\nvalue-realism. The \u201cabsoluteness\u201d of the imperative is\nrelative to the committed subject; the imperative, in Kantian terms,\nis a hypothetical imperative binding only on those who satisfy the\ncondition of being so committed (Drummond 2018b: 141\u201342).\n\nWhat we have called \u201cstrong\u201d value realism, by contrast,\npoints to universal imperatives tied, for example, to the hierarchy of\nvalues mentioned above: sensuous values; vital values; spiritual\nvalues; and the values of the holy and unholy. This list notably\nincludes no moral values. Scheler distinguishes between the purely\nideal ought-to-be (the value) and the moral ought-to-do (Scheler\n1913/1916 [1973: 203ff.], cf. Blosser 1987). Moral values, then,\nattach to actions that realize the values named in the hierarchy.\nHartmann is committed to a similar view regarding imperatives. Ideal\nvalues are experienced as demands, and the gravity of the violation of\na demand and the merit derived from fulfilling a demand are measured\nby the value\u2019s strength and height. Hartmann acknowledges,\nhowever, that these categorical demands are problematic. Personal and\nuniversal values conflict in ways that can never be fully resolved. To\ndo what everyone should do in the same circumstances is, in effect, to\nsay an agent is replaceable by anyone, and this, for Hartmann, is to\ndeny the agent\u2019s individuality as a person (1926 [1963: 357]).\nAppeals to universal principles depend upon a typicality among the\nsituations in which we are called upon to act, but any maxim of action\nmust be tied to a particular situation and to a particular agent in\nthat situation. Hence, on Hartmann\u2019s view, the universality of a\nprinciple undercuts its applicability to a particular situation that,\nowing to the uniqueness of persons and their interests and\ncommitments, is itself unique (Hartmann 1926 [1963: 358\u2013360]).\nUniversal principles, in a paradoxical way, just insofar as they fail\nto heed the individual personalities of agents, do not, and cannot,\noffer moral guidance. This conclusion pushes back in the direction of\nthe Husserlian position on axiological approaches to the phenomenology\nof action.\n\nNot all Phenomenologists adopt the axiological approach to moral\ntheory. Heidegger (1927 [2010: 97]), for example, was dismissive of\nthen-prevalent theories of value, and he turns instead to freedom and\n\u201cauthenticity\u201d to characterize ethical subjectivity. By\n\u201cauthenticity\u201d, he means a subject\u2019s taking\nresponsibility for and ownership over the choices she makes that give\nmeaning and value to her life. She thereby lifts herself out of the\nmoral complacency that characterizes agents who passively accept\ntraditional and cultural conceptions of what \u201cone\u201d does\n(Loidolt 2018: 703\u2013704). It is disputed whether Heidegger thus\ncommits himself to a \u201cdecisionism\u201d\u2014that is, the view\nthat a subject chooses who she will be without recourse to reasons or\nevaluative standards (cf., e.g., Tugendhat 1979, Okrent 1999)\u2014or\na \u201cdeep deliberation\u201d\u2014the view that the subject\nchooses who she will be in a critical reflection on her own identity\n(see Crowell 2007, 2013; Burch 2010).\n\nIf Heidegger is read in the direction of decisionism, however, he\nforeshadows those Phenomenologists who offer a constructivist account\nof value centered on the notion of freedom (e.g., Sartre 1943,\nBeauvoir 1947, and Merleau-Ponty 1945; also see the entry on\nconstructivism in metaethics). They believe that values are created\n(\u201cconstituted\u201d or \u201cconstructed\u201d) in the\nexercise of human freedom. The Phenomenologists who take a\nconstructivist approach to value and who claim that values are created\nin the exercise of human freedom adopt somewhat differing accounts of\nfreedom. The most radical view (e.g., Sartre 1943) claims that the\nexercise of the freedom definitive of human beings constitutes the\nreality of values in consciously and actively transcending the\nagent\u2019s situation, and that this exercise lacks transcendent\nvalues to justify it. Freedom, although itself unconstrained,\nnevertheless in its exercise, encounters factical obstacles, including\nmost importantly the presence of other autonomous agents. A weaker\nversion (e.g., Beauvoir 1947) also places freedom and transcendence at\nthe center of her ethical life while recognizing the obstacles freedom\nfaces. The goal at which freedom aims \u201cis not fixed once and for\nall\u201d but rather \u201cis defined all along the road which leads\nto it\u201d (Beauvoir 1947 [1948: 153]). For Beauvoir, this\nfundamental ambiguity characterizes human existence. Against the\nstronger view, however, Beauvoir believes that the other\u2019s\nfreedom cannot be viewed simply as an obstacle to one\u2019s own\nexercise of freedom. Rather, one\u2019s own freedom and the\nrealization of one\u2019s projects requires the cooperative freedom\nof others.\n\nA third constructivist alternative (see Merleau-Ponty 1945) frames the\nideas of freedom, transcendence, and ambiguity as analogous to\nartistic expression. Freedom seeks to create value within the\nlimitations of a given situation. On this view, the significance and\nvalue of things is not constituted in the free choices of agents, even\nwhen unconscious and non-deliberated; instead persons are born into a\nworld already permeated with meaning, and freedom is exercised in this\ncontext. Moral agents take the world as a task to be completed, a task\nof instituting meaning and value wherever and whenever possible\nthrough action. To create value consists in actively taking up our\nsituations of chance, making something out of contingency,\nestablishing communicative relationships, and creating and recreating\nvalues by actively changing the world.\n\nYet other Phenomenologists adopt a deontic viewpoint and challenge the\naxiological and constructivist approaches on the ground that values\nare often experienced as prescriptions, norms, imperatives,\nobligations, demands, and requirements. Since values are experienced\nin relation to feelings and emotions, the objection goes, it would\nseem that we are always free to value and choose otherwise, precisely\nbecause our feelings, interests, and choices can vary. Because of\nthat, it is difficult to understand in what sense the values we\nencounter can be thought to impose unconditional obligations.\n\nOne response would be to ascribe a strict necessity and universality\nto at least some moral values such that anyone recognizing those\nvalues would recognize the duty to realize the value in action.\nScheler (1913/1916 [1973: 203ff.]), for example, claims that insight\ninto the purely ideal ought-to-be (the value) serves as the basis for\nwilling and realizing the moral ought-to-do. But there is no clear\naccount in Scheler of the transition from the insight into ideal\nvalue-possibilities to the experience of moral imperatives, and it is\nnot clear that the experience of obligation would arise were one not\nto recognize the value. Von Hildebrand, by contrast, thinking that\nScheler\u2019s view entails that the spontaneous love of value\nmotivates action only hypothetically, insists that moral obligation\nhas categorical force. The \u201cimportance\u201d\n(Bedeutsamkeit) of an object enables it to awaken a\nperson\u2019s interest or motivate her action. Value is the kind of\nimportance that a thing has in itself (von Hildebrand 1916), and von\nHildebrand isolates a group of values that are good per se\napart from any relation to a subject\u2019s interests, needs, and\nwants. In making this move, however, if he gains a ground of\nobligation, he does so at the expense of divorcing these values and\ntheir attendant demands on us from their importance to the\nagent and thereby their character as motivating the subject to\nact.\n\nSimilarly, the deontic Phenomenologists argue that, since the\nconstructivist believes that values are created in the exercise of\nhuman autonomy, it is difficult to understand how an agent\u2019s\nchoices, while self-binding (at least for the moment), can legislate\nuniversal obligations that an agent would experience as a duty.\nLacking the view of practical reason found, for example, in Kant,\nconstructivism cannot underwrite moral normativity, in particular, the\nexperience of universal obligation.\n\nThe deontic Phenomenologists seek to ground the notion of obligation\nindependently of any notion of value or volition. On their view, the\nexperience of obligation is prior to all acts of evaluation, all\nchoices, all projects, and all dictates of reason, and it reveals\nitself in the experience of other persons (the Other). The deontic\nview grounds ethics in intersubjectivity, adopting a\n\u201csecond-person perspective\u201d in which encountering the\n\u201cface\u201d of the Other is the ground of obligation (Levinas\n1961; 1974; L\u00f8gstrup 1956; cf. Darwall 2006; see the entry on\n Emmanuel Levinas).\n The subject encounters an ethical transcendence in\nencountering the face of the Other insofar as the face is expressive\n(Levinas 1961 [1969: 51])\u2014the \u201crevelation\u201d (1961\n[1969: 73]) or \u201cepiphany\u201d (1961 [1969: 194])\u2014of the\nOther. My original ethical access to the Other disrupts my\nsubjectivity; the Other \u201cspeaks\u201d to me and calls me out of\nmy subjectivity. The Other, in short, is encountered as a summons and\na command, and the only appropriate form of encountering the Other,\ntherefore, is to respond. Only to the extent that I acknowledge this\nsummons and command do I live in a world with the Other and thereby\nbecome a person\u2014a moral agent\u2014myself. The Other and I\nexist in an asymmetrical relation wherein the Other\u2019s ethical\nsuperiority outweighs my egoism, unsettles my conscious\nintentionality, and contests my freedom in such a way that I must\nrespond. On this view, moral agency begins with neither my feelings\nand their correlative values nor my (constructive) freedom, but with\nthe recognition that my freedom is arbitrarily limited by my\nresponsibility to the Other. The experience of the Other is thus from\nthe beginning an experience of obligation.\n",
