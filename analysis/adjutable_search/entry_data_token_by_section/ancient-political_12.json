    "main_text": "Aristotle || Ethics and Politics by Way of Law\n4.2 Ethics and Politics by Way of Law\n\nIn considering practical reason to be the domain of both ethics and\npolitics, Aristotle follows Plato in drawing no sharp line between\nthose two domains (see on this point for ancient testimonies and\nmodern arguments respectively, Bod\u00e9\u00fcs 1993: 22\u201324\nand 59\u201363, and Vander Waerdt 1991, though for a contrary\nargument, see Duvall and Dotson 1998). In fact he closes his\nNicomachean Ethics by remarking that for most people, the\npractice of ethics can only be ensured by their being governed by law,\nwhich combines necessity (compulsion) with reason and habituates\npeople toward virtuous action (Nicomachean Ethics\n1179b32\u20131180a5) (Duke 2020). Because, for most people, the ethical\nlife presupposes government by law, the student of ethics must become\na student of political science, studying the science of legislation in\nlight of the collection of constitutions assembled by Aristotle and\nhis school in the Lyceum. All but part of one of the over one hundred\nitems in this collection reported in antiquity have been lost: a\nconsiderable part of the analysis of the \u201cConstitution of\nAthens\u201d was recovered from a papyrus discovered in the\nnineteenth century. Aristotle\u2019s theoretical claims about the\nnature of politics in the Politics must be understood against\nthis backdrop. The legislator (whose standpoint is adopted in the\nPolitics, see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s political theory)\n needs to have a grasp of the nature of politics as such (pursued\nespecially in Books I and III); an understanding of the major\nfaultlines in the interpretation and practice of politics (pursued\nespecially in Books II and IV\u2013VI); and a grip on the structure\nand characteristics of the specific city for which he aims to\nlegislate (pursued also in Book II for existing constitutions and\nconstitutional models; Books IV\u2013VI for types of flawed\nconstitutions; and Books VII\u2013VIII for the \u201cbest\nconstitution\u201d (1323a14).\n\nAt the beginning of Book IV (1288b1\u201339), Aristotle offers a\nfourfold account of what the expertise regarding constitutions must\nencompass. As glossed by Eugene Garver (2011: 107), and drawing on\nstandard Aristotelian terminology distinguishing formal from material\ncauses, these include: \u201cThe first, \u2018that which is best in\nthe abstract\u2019...orients politics around the end of politics, the\nbest life. The second, the best relative to circumstances, starts with\nthe material cause and organizes political inquiry around the best\nthat can be made out of given material. The third, the best on a\nhypothesis, starts not from the true end of politics, but any posited\nend, and so looks for means and devices that will preserve any given\nconstitution. The final inquiry, the search for \u2018the form of\nconstitution which is best suited to states in general,\u2019\narticulates a formal cause that can organize almost any material, any\nkind of people.\u201d These four elements of expertise regarding\nconstitution are not tidily segregated in different parts of the text;\nthey are pursued variously, sometimes in combination, and draw on\nwider discussions of the nature of politics and the human good that\nare threaded throughout.\n",
