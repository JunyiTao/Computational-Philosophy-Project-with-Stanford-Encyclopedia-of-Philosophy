Transformational Grammar\n\nEven given restricted quantifiers (and acceptance of second-order\nlogical forms), the subject/predicate structure of \u2018Juliet /\nlikes every doctor\u2019 diverges from the corresponding formula\nbelow.\n\n\\[\\forall y{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y) [\\textrm{Likes}(\\textrm{Juliet}, y)]\n\\]\n\n\nWe can rewrite \u2018\\(\\textrm{Likes}(\\textrm{Juliet}, y)\\)\u2019 as\n\u2018\\([\\textrm{Likes}(y)](\\textrm{Juliet})\\)\u2019, to reflect the\nfact that \u2018likes\u2019 combines with a direct object to form a\nphrase, which in turn combines with a subject. But this does not\naffect the main point: \u2018every\u2019 seems to be a grammatical\nconstituent of the verb phrase \u2018likes every doctor\u2019; yet\nit also seems to indicate the main quantifier of the expressed\nproposition. In natural language, \u2018likes\u2019 and \u2018every\ndoctor\u2019 form a phrase. But with respect to logical form, it is\nas if \u2018likes\u2019 combines with \u2018Juliet\u2019 and a\nvariable to form a complex predicate that is in turn an external\nargument of the higher-order predicate \u2018every\u2019. Similar\nremarks apply to \u2018Some boy likes every doctor\u2019 and\n\n\\[\\lsquo[\\exists x{:}\\textrm{Boy}(x)][\\forall y{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y)]\\{\\textrm{Likes}(x,y)\\}\\rsquo.\\]\n\n\nSo it\nseems that mismatches remain in the very places that troubled medieval\nlogicians\u2014viz., quantificational direct objects and other\nexamples of complex predicates with quantificational constituents.\n\nMontague (1970, 1974) showed that these mismatches do not preclude\nsystematic connections of natural language sentences with the\ncorresponding propositional structures. Abstracting from the technical\ndetails, one can specify an algorithm that pairs each natural language\nsentence that contains one or more quantificational expressions like\n\u2018every doctor\u2019 with one or more Fregean logical forms.\nThis was a significant advance. Together with subsequent developments,\nMontague\u2019s work showed that Frege\u2019s logic was compatible\nwith the idea that quantificational constructions in natural language\nhave a systematic semantics. Indeed, one can use Frege\u2019s formal\napparatus to study such constructions. Montague maintained that the\nsyntax of natural language was, nonetheless, misleading for purposes\nof (what he took to be) real semantics. On this view, the study of\nvalid inference still suggests that grammar disguises the structure of\npropositional thought. But in thinking about the relation of logic to\ngrammar, one should not assume a naive conception of the latter.\n\nFor example, the grammatical form of a sentence need not be determined\nby the linear order of its words. Using brackets to disambiguate, we\ncan distinguish the sentence \u2018Mary [saw [the [boy [with\nbinoculars]]]]\u2019\u2014whose direct object is \u2018the boy with\nbinoculars\u2019\u2014from the homophonous sentence \u2018Mary\n[[saw [the boy]] [with binoculars]]\u2019, in which \u2018saw the\nboy\u2019 is modified by an adverbial phrase. The first implies that\nthe boy had binoculars, while the second implies that Mary used\nbinoculars to see the boy. Even if this distinction is not audibly\nmarked, there is a significant difference between modifying a noun\n(like \u2018boy\u2019) with a prepositional phrase and modifying a\nverb phrase (\u2018saw the boy\u2019). More generally, grammatical\nstructure need not be obvious. Just as it may take work to discover\nthe kind(s) of structure that propositions exhibit, so it may take\nwork to discover the kind(s) of structure that sentences exhibit. And\nmany studies of natural language suggest a rich conception of\ngrammatical form that diverges from traditional views; see especially\nChomsky (1957, 1964, 1965, 1981, 1986, 1995). So we need to ask how\nlogical forms are related to actual grammatical forms, which linguists\ntry to discover, since these may differ importantly from any\nhypothesized grammatical forms that may be suggested by casual\nreflection on spoken language. Appearances may be misleading with\nrespect to both grammatical and logical form, leaving room for the\npossibility that these notions of structure are not so different after\nall.\n\nA leading idea of modern linguistics is that at least some grammatical\nstructures are transformations of others. Put another way, linguistic\nexpressions often appear to be displaced from positions canonically\nassociated with certain grammatical relations that the expressions\nexhibit. For example, the word \u2018who\u2019 in (17) is apparently\nassociated with the internal (direct object) argument position of the\nverb \u2018saw\u2019.\n\n(17)\nMary wondered who John saw\n\n\nCorrespondingly, (17) can be glossed as \u2018Mary wondered which\nperson is such that John saw that person\u2019. This invites the\nhypothesis that (17) reflects a transformation of the \u201cDeep\nStructure\u201d (17D) into the \u201cSurface Structure\u201d (17S);\nwhere the subscripts indicate that \u2018who\u2019 bears a certain\ngrammatical relation, often called \u201cmovement,\u201d to the\ncoindexed position.\n\n(17D)\n{Mary [wondered {John [saw who]}]}\n(17S)\n{Mary [wondered [whoi {John [saw\n( \u2026 )i ]}]]}\n\n\nThe idea is that the embedded clause in (17D) has the same form as\n\u2018John saw Bill\u2019, but in (17S), \u2018who\u2019 has been\ndisplaced from its original argument position. Similar remarks apply\nto the question \u2018Who did John see\u2019 and other\nquestion-words like \u2018why\u2019, \u2018what\u2019,\n\u2018when\u2019, and \u2018how\u2019.\n\nOne might also try to explain the synonymy of (18) and (19) by\npositing a common deep structure, (18D).\n\n(18)\nJohn seems to like Mary\n(19)\nIt seems John likes Mary\n(18D)\n[Seems{John [likes Mary]}]\n(18S)\n{Johni [seems { ( _ )i [to like Mary]}]}\n\n\nIf every English sentence needs a subject of some kind, (18D) must be\nmodified: either by displacing \u2018John\u2019, as in (18S); or by\ninserting a pleonastic subject, as in (19). Note that in (19),\n\u2018It\u2019 does not indicate an argument; compare\n\u2018There\u2019 in \u2018There is something in the garden\u2019.\nAppeal to displacement also lets one distinguish the superficially\nparallel sentences (20) and (21).\n\n(20)\nJohn is easy to please\n(21)\nJohn is eager to please\n\n\nIf (20) is true, John is easily pleased. In which case, it is easy\n(for someone) to please John; and here, \u2018it\u2019 is\npleonastic. But if (21) is true, John is eager that he please someone\nor other. This asymmetry is effaced by representations like\n\u2018Easy-to-please(John)\u2019 and\n\u2018Eager-to-please(John)\u2019. The contrast is made manifest,\nhowever, with (20S) and (21S); where \u2018e\u2019 indicates an\nunpronounced argument position.\n\n(20S)\n{Johni [is easy { e [to please (\n_ )i ]}]}\n(21S)\n{Johni [is eager { ( _\n)i [to please e ]}]}\n\n\nIt may be that in (21S), which does not mean that it is eager for John\nto please someone, \u2018John\u2019 is grammatically linked to the\ncoindexed position without being displaced from that position. But\nwhatever the details, the \u201csurface subject\u201d of a sentence\ncan be the object of a verb embedded within the main predicate, as in\n(20S). Of course, such hypotheses about grammatical structure require\ndefense. But Chomsky and others have long argued that such hypotheses\nare needed to account for various facts concerning human linguistic\ncapacities; see, e.g., Berwick et.al. (2011). As an illustration of\nthe kind of data that is relevant, note that while (22\u201324) are\nperfectly fine as expressions of English, (25) is not.\n\n(22)\nThe boy who sang was happy\n(23)\nWas the boy who sang happy\n(24)\nThe boy who was happy sang\n(25)\n*Was the boy who happy sang\n\n\nThis suggests that the auxiliary verb \u2018was\u2019 can be\ndisplaced from some positions but not others. That is, while (23S) is\na permissible transformation of (22D), (25S) is not a permissible\ntransformation of (24D).\n\n(22D)\n{[The [boy [who sang]]] [was happy]}\n(23S)\nWasi {[the [boy [who sang]]] [\n( _ )i happy]}\n(24D)\n{[The [boy [who [was happy]]]] sang}\n(25S)\n*Wasi {[the [boy [who [ ( _\n)i happy]]]] sang}\n\n\nIn (25), the asterisk indicates intuitive deviance; in (25S), it\nindicates the hypothesized source of this deviance\u2014viz., that\nthe auxiliary verb cannot be displaced from the embedded relative\nclause. The ill-formedness of (25S) is striking, since one can\nsensibly ask whether or not the boy who was happy sang. One can also\nask whether or not (26) is true. But (27) is not the yes/no question\ncorresponding to (26).\n\n(26)\nThe boy who was lost kept crying\n(27)\nWas the boy who lost kept crying\n\n\nRather, (27) is the yes/no question corresponding to \u2018The boy\nwho lost was kept crying\u2019, which has an unexpected meaning. So\nwe want some account of why (27) cannot have the interpretation\ncorresponding to (26). But this \u201cnegative fact\u201d concerning\n(27) is precisely what one would expect if \u2018was\u2019 cannot be\ndisplaced from its position in (26), as in the following logically\npossible but grammatically illicit structure: *Wasi\n{[the [boy [who [( _ )i lost]]]] [kept crying]}.\n\nBy contrast, if we merely specify an algorithm that associates (27)\nwith its actual meaning\u2014or if we merely hypothesize that (27) is\nthe English translation of a certain mental sentence\u2014we have not\nyet explained why (27) cannot also be used to ask whether or not (26)\nis true. Explanations of such facts appeal to nonobvious grammatical\nstructure, and constraints on natural language transformations. (For\nexample, an auxiliary verb in a relative clause cannot be\n\u201cfronted;\u201d though of course, theorists try to find deeper\nexplanations for such constraints.)\n\nThe idea was that a sentence has both a deep structure (DS), which\nreflects semantically relevant relations between verbs and their\narguments, and a surface structure (SS) that may include displaced (or\npleonastic) elements. In some cases, pronunciation might depend on\nfurther transformations of SS, resulting in a distinct\n\u201cphonological form\u201d (PF). Linguists posited various\nconstraints on these levels of grammatical structure, and the\ntransformations that relate them. But as the theory was elaborated and\nrefined under empirical pressure, various facts that apparently called\nfor explanation in these terms still went unexplained. This suggested\nanother level of grammatical structure, obtained by a different kind\nof transformation on SS. The hypothesized level was called\n\u2018LF\u2019, intimating \u2018Logical Form\u2019; and the\nhypothesized transformation\u2014called \u2018Quantifier\nRaising\u2019 because it targeted the kinds of expressions that\nindicate (restricted) quantifiers\u2014mapped structures like (28S)\nonto structures like (28L).\n\n(28S)\n{Juliet [likes [every doctor]]}\n(28L)\n{[every doctor]i {Juliet [\nlikes ( _ )i ]}}\n\n\nClearly, (28L) does not reflect the pronounced word order in English.\nBut the idea was that PF determines pronunciation, while LF was said\nto be the level at which the scope of a natural language quantifier is\ndetermined; see May (1985). If we think about \u2018every\u2019 as a\nkind of second-order transitive predicate, which can combine with two\npredicates like \u2018doctor\u2019 and \u2018Juliet likes ( _\n)i\u2019 to form a complete sentence, we should\nexpect that at some level of analysis, the sentence \u2018Juliet\nlikes every doctor\u2019 has the structure indicated in (28L). And\nmapping (28L) to the Fregean logical\nform\n\n\\[\\lsquo [\\forall x{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(x)]\\{\\textrm{Likes}(\\textrm{Juliet},\nx)\\}\\rsquo\\]\n\n\nis trivial.  Similarly, consider the following:\n\n(29S)\n{[some boy] [likes [every doctor]]}\n(29L)\n{[some boy]i {[every\ndoctor]jj {( _ )i [likes ( _\n)j ]}}\n(29L\u2032)\n{[every doctor]j {[some\nboy]i { ( _ )i [likes ( _\n)j ]}}}\n\nIf the surface structure\n(29S) can be mapped onto either (29L) or (29L\u2032), then (29S) can\nbe easily mapped onto the Fregean logical\nforms\n\n\\[\\lsquo[\\exists x{:}\\textrm{Boy}(x)][\\forall\ny{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y)]\\{\\textrm{Likes}(x,y)\\}\\rsquo\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\lsquo [\\forall y{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y)][\\exists x{:} \\textrm{Boy}(x)]\\{\\textrm{Likes}(x,y)\\}\\rsquo .\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis assimilates quantifier scope ambiguity to the structural\nambiguity of examples like \u2018Juliet saw the boy with\nbinoculars\u2019. More generally, many apparent examples of\ngrammar/logic mismatches were rediagnosed as mismatches between\ndifferent aspects of grammatical structure\u2014between those aspects\nthat determine pronunciation, and those that determine interpretation.\nIn one sense, this is fully in keeping with the idea that in natural\nlanguage, \u201csurface appearances\u201d are often misleading with\nregard to propositional structure. But it also makes room for the idea\nthat grammatical structure and logical structure converge, in ways\nthat can be discovered through investigation, once we move beyond\ntraditional subject-predicate conceptions of structure with regard to\nboth logic and grammar.\n\nThere is independent evidence for \u201ccovert\u201d\ntransformations\u2014displacement of expressions from their audible\npositions, as in (28L); see Huang (1995), Hornstein (1995). Consider\n\u2018Jean a vu qui\u2019, which is the French translation of\n\u2018Who did John see\u2019. If we assume that \u2018qui\u2019\n(\u2018who\u2019) is displaced at LF, then we can explain why the\nquestion-word is understood in both French and English like a\nquantifier binding a variable: which person \\(x\\) is such that John saw \\(x\\)?\nSimilarly, example (30) from Chinese is transliterated as in (31).\n\n(30)\nZhangsan zhidao Lisi mai-te sheme\n(31)\nZhangsan know Lisi bought what\n\n\nBut (30) is ambiguous, between the interrogative (31a) and the complex\ndeclarative (31b).\n\n(31a)\nWhich thing is such that Zhangsan knows Lisi bought\nit\n(31b)\nZhangsan knows which thing (is such that) Lisi\nbought (it)\n\n\nThis suggests covert displacement of the quantificational\nquestion-word in Chinese; see Huang (1982, 1995). Chomsky (1981) also\nargued that the constraints on such displacement can help explain\ncontrasts like the one illustrated with (32) and (33).\n\n(32)\nWho said he has the best smile\n(33)\nWho did he say has the best smile\n\n\nIn (32), the pronoun \u2018he\u2019 can have a bound-variable\nreading: which person \\(x\\) is such that \\(x\\) said that \\(x\\) has the best smile.\nThis suggests that the following grammatical structure is possible:\nWhoi {[( )i said\n[hei has the best smile]]}. But (33) cannot be used\nto ask this question, suggesting that some linguistic constraint rules\nout the following logically possible structure:\n*Whoi [did {[hei say [(\n)i has the best smile]]]. And there cannot be\nconstraints on transformations without transformations. So if English\novertly displaces question-words that are covertly displaced in other\nlanguages, we should not be too surprised if English covertly\ndisplaces other quantificational expressions like \u2018every\ndoctor\u2019. Likewise, (34) has the reading indicated in (34a) but\nnot the reading indicated in (34b).\n\n(34)\nIt is false that Juliet likes every doctor\n(34a)\n\\(\\neg \\forall x{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(x) [\\textrm{Likes}(\\textrm{Juliet}, x)]\\)\n(34b)\n\\(\\forall x{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(x) \\neg [\\textrm{Likes}(\\textrm{Juliet}, x)]\\)\n\n\nThis suggests that \u2018every doctor\u2019 gets displaced, but only\nso far. Similarly, (13) cannot mean that every doctor is such that no\npatient who saw that doctor is healthy.\n\n(13)\nNo patient who saw every doctor is healthy\n\n\nAs we have already seen, English seems to abhor fronting certain\nelements from within an embedded relative clause. This invites the\nhypothesis that Quantifier Raising is subject to a similar constraint,\nand hence, that many quantificational expressions get displaced in\nEnglish. This hypothesis is not uncontroversial; see, e.g., Jacobson\n(1999). But many linguists (following Chomsky [1995, 2000]) would now\nposit only two levels of grammatical structure, corresponding to PF\nand LF\u2014the thought being that constraints on DS and SS can be\neschewed in favor of a simpler theory that only posits constraints on\nhow expressions can be combined in the course of constructing complex\nexpressions that can be pronounced and interpreted. If this\ndevelopment of earlier theories proves correct, then the only\nsemantically relevant level of grammatical structure often reflects\ncovert displacement of audible expressions; see, e.g., Hornstein\n(1995). In any case, there is a large body of work suggesting that\nmany logical properties of quantifiers, names, and pronouns are\nreflected in properties of LF.\n\nFor example, if (35) is true, it follows that some doctor treated some\ndoctor; whereas (36) does not have this consequence:\n\n(35)\nEvery boy saw the doctor who treated himself\n(36)\nEvery boy saw the doctor who treated him\n\n\nThe meanings of (35) and (36) seem to be roughly as indicated in (35a)\nand (36a); where \u2018\\(!\\)\u2019 indicates the contribution of\n\u2018the\u2019.\n\n(35a)\n\\([\\forall x{:}\\textrm{Boy}(x)][!y{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y) \\land \\textrm{Treated}(y,y)] \\{\\textrm{Saw}(x,y)\\}\\)\n(36a)\n\\([\\forall x{:}\\textrm{Boy}(x)][!y{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y) \\land \\textrm{Treated}(y,x)] \\{\\textrm{Saw}(x,y)\\}\\)\n\n\nThis suggests that \u2018himself\u2019 is behaving like a variable\nbound by \u2018the doctor\u2019, while \u2018every boy\u2019 can\nbind \u2018him\u2019. And there are independent grammatical reasons\nfor saying that \u2018himself\u2019 must be linked to \u2018the\ndoctor\u2019, while \u2018him\u2019 must not be so linked. Note\nthat in \u2018Pat thinks Chris treated himself/him\u2019, the\nantecedent of \u2018himself\u2019 must be the subject of\n\u2018treated\u2019, while the antecedent of \u2018him\u2019 must\nnot be; see Chomsky (1981).\n\nWe still need to enforce the conceptual distinction between LF and the\ntraditional notion of logical form. There is no guarantee that\nstructural features of natural language sentences will mirror the\nlogical features of propositions; cp. Stanley (2000), King (2007). But\nthis leaves room for the empirical hypothesis that LF reflects at\nleast a great deal of propositional structure; see Harman (1972),\nHigginbotham (1986), Segal (1989), Larson and Ludlow (1993), and the\nessay on\n structured propositions.\n Moreover, even if the LF of a sentence S underdetermines the logical\nform of the proposition a speaker expresses with S (on a given\noccasion of use), the LF may provide a \u201cscaffolding\u201d that\ncan be elaborated in particular contexts, with little or no mismatch\nbetween grammatical and propositional architecture. If some such view\nis correct, it might avoid certain (unpleasant) questions prompted by\nearlier Fregean views: how can a sentence be used to express a\nproposition with a radically different structure; and if grammar is\ndeeply misleading, why think that our intuitions concerning\nimpeccability provide reliable evidence about which propositions\nfollow from which? These are, however, issues that remain\nunsettled.\n",
