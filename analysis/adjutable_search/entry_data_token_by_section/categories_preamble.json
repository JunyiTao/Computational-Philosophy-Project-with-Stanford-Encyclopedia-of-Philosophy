    "main_text": "\n\nA system of categories is a complete list of highest kinds or genera.\nTraditionally, following Aristotle, these have been thought of as\nhighest genera of entities (in the widest sense of the term), so that\na system of categories undertaken in this realist spirit would ideally\nprovide an inventory of everything there is, thus answering the most\nbasic of metaphysical questions: \u201cWhat is there?\u201d\nSkepticism about our ability to discern a unique system of basic\ncategories of \u2018reality itself\u2019 has led others to approach\ncategory systems not with the aim of cataloging the highest kinds in\nthe world itself, but rather with the aim of elucidating the\ncategories of our conceptual system or language. Thus Kant makes the\nshift to a conceptualist approach by drawing out the categories that\nare a priori necessary for any possible cognition of objects.\nSince such categories are guaranteed to apply to any possible object\nof cognition, they retain a certain sort of ontological import,\nalthough this application is limited to phenomena, not the thing in\nitself. After Kant, it has been common to approach the project of\ncategories in a neutral spirit that Brian Carr (1987, 7) calls\n\u201ccategorial descriptivism\u201d, as describing the categorial\nstructure that the world would have according to our thought,\nexperience, or language, while refraining from making commitments\nabout whether or not these categories are occupied, or are ontically\nfundamental. Edmund Husserl approaches categories in something like\nthis way, since he begins by laying out categories of\nmeanings, which may then be used to draw out\nontological categories (categories of possible objects meant)\nas the correlates of the meaning categories, without concern for any\nempirical matter about whether or not there really are objects of the\nvarious ontological categories discerned.\n\nA system of ontological categories drawn out in any of these modes has\nthe potential for a great many uses in philosophy, but those who would\noffer such systems of categories also face a variety of difficulties.\nThey must address the issue of what the proper methods are by means of\nwhich categories are to be distinguished, how many categories there\nare and what they are, whether or not there is a single summum\ngenus subsuming all other categories, and whether we should\ndistinguish a single system of categories or multiple dimensions of\ncategories \u2013 issues on which there has been little\nagreement.\n\nOver the past hundred years, skepticism about the possibility of\noffering a uniquely true and complete system of ontological categories\nhas led discussion of categories to shift from attempts to offer\ncomplete systems of categories to attempts merely to draw particular\ndistinctions, especially among our conceptual or linguistic\ncategories. Work on category differences, unlike that on category\nsystems, does not generally purport to answer deep metaphysical\nquestions about what things or kinds of things exist; instead,\ncategory differences are typically articulated as a way of diagnosing\nand avoiding various philosophical problems and confusions.\nNonetheless, even those who merely argue for category differences owe\nan account of the conditions under which two concepts, terms, or\nobjects belong to different categories.\n",
