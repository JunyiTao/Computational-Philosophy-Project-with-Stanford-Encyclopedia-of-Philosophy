The Nature of Memory\n\nThe epistemology of memory has been the epistemology of human memory.\nIt\u2019s the sort of memory we are most familiar with. Perhaps this\neveryday familiarity is informative enough for our epistemological\ntheorizing. We can do well without looking closely at how human memory\nworks, and the psychology and philosophy here can have a crisp and\nlittle-trafficked border. The epistemology of memory up through the\ntwentieth century often carried on as if this were so. But more\nrecently epistemologists have favored an empirically-informed\napproach.\n1.1 Human Memory\n\nHuman memory is not one but several things or systems (Michaelian\n2011c). The systems play different roles, most of which we might call\n\u201cremembering\u201d, even though the remembering may vary\nnotably from one system to the next. Some memory systems also help us\nimagine possibilities or think about the future, however. As the entry\non\n memory\n already taxonomizes human memory systems in detail, this entry will\nnot. It will, however, briefly overview some of them. Psychologists\nand philosophers often distinguish declarative from non-declarative\nmemory, which may roughly differentiate memory for accessible\ninformation from memory for everything else. Declarative memory\nincludes episodic and semantic memory (Tulving 1972). How best to\ndivide episodic and semantic memory turns out to be delicate and\ncontroversial. But they at least superficially differ in many ways,\nincluding in their characteristic content. To simplify: the content of\nsemantic memory is propositional, while the content of episodic memory\nis (a representation of) an event from the rememberer\u2019s past.\nYour friend might remember that a strange event took place\nrecently, because you told her so. But despite your telling, she is in\nno position to remember the event. Here, she is the\nrememberer, and the event was in your personal past, not hers.\n\nThe epistemology of memory has focused on declarative memory, perhaps\nto no one\u2019s surprise. Epistemology is the philosophical study of\nknowledge and of what makes believing reasonable. The epistemology of\nmemory examines memory\u2019s role in this. Epistemology covers most\noften the kinds of knowledge and reasonable believing that pertain to\naccessible information. Declarative memory seems more relevant here\nthan non-declarative. Moreover, since epistemology covers most often\nthe kinds of knowledge and reasonable believing that have\npropositional content, semantic memory seems more relevant here than\nepisodic. The line from remembering that p to knowing that\np makes fewer corkscrews than the line from remembering some\nevent concerning p to knowing that p. Consequently,\nsemantic memory has dominated the epistemology of memory. But in the\nlast few decades, episodic memory has stolen the show in the broader\nphilosophy of memory. It\u2019s safe to bet that a renaissance in the\nepistemology of episodic memory is not far off.\n\nRecent, empirically-minded epistemology of memory has been sensitive\nto a key feature that at least some of our memory systems seem to\nbear: they are constructive. It is most clearly the case that episodic\nmemory in particular is constructive (for the case laid out for a\ngeneral audience, see Schacter 1996, 2001). Remembering events is not\nthe straightforward affair we might have supposed. We might have\nsupposed that memory functions like an archive for the records of what\nwe have experienced; to learn is to deposit into the archive, to\nremember is to withdraw an unchanged deposit, and to forget is for the\narchive to malfunction. The prevailing view now, however, is that\nmemory is constructive, and not just occasionally but normally\n(Michaelian 2011b, 2016). Remembering is not (simply) reproducing a\nrecord, but generating new content.\n\nThis may seem to suggest that memory\u2019s role in our knowing and\nreasonably believing is more limited than we\u2019d thought. New\ncontent from memory is suspicious\u2014likely inaccurate or\nunsupported\u2014particularly if memory is supposed to\nfunction like an archive. But the evidence to support this suspicion\nis wanting (Michaelian 2011b, 2016). Episodic memory is generative,\nbut not in general at the cost of truth. Puddifoot and Bortolotti\n(2019) argue, for instance, that the cognitive mechanisms responsible\nfor certain false memory beliefs are indeed \u201cepistemically\ninnocent\u201d , as they overall increase a subject\u2019s chances\nof having other true beliefs or knowledge (see also Bortolotti and\nSullivan-Bissett 2018). Episodic memory\u2019s epistemic credentials\nare not clearly comprised.\n Section 2.4\n below further explores the significance of memory construction in\nepistemology.\n1.2 Theories of memory\n\nA theory of memory is roughly a theory of how memory works or of what\nremembering consists in. Almost no theories of memory are essentially\nepistemological. Almost none require any discussion of epistemology.\nFor that reason, this entry will say little about theories of memory\n(but see entry on\n memory).\n One unique theory of memory, however, merits coverage here: the\nepistemic theory of memory. Why? For one, it is essentially\nepistemological. And for another, it stands apart from what most of\nthis entry will focus on.\n Section 2\n covers theories that, in a way, use memory to illuminate\nepistemology, and epistemology to illuminate memory\u2019s\nepistemic power. The theories comment on the conditions in\nwhich memory provides or cannot provide some epistemic good, and why.\nThe epistemic theory of memory, however, uses epistemology to\nilluminate the memory\u2019s nature. Rather than explain\nknowing in terms of remembering, the epistemic theory explains\nremembering in terms of knowing.\n\nThe epistemic theory places an epistemic necessary condition on\nremembering. More specifically, propositional remembering requires\nknowing (Anscombe 1981; Ayer 1956; Audi 2002; Locke 1971; Malcolm\n1963; Moon 2013; Owens 2000; Pappas 1980; Williamson 2000). Any\nsubject who remembers that p knows that p. This\ntheory can lift a lantern to the nature of remembering, as it implies\nthat every necessary condition for knowing is also one for\nremembering. If knowing requires believing, remembering requires it\ntoo. If knowing requires truth, so does remembering. And so on.\n\nStronger versions of the epistemic theory say that remembering at a\nmoment requires knowing not only then but also previously. They add,\nmoreover, that that earlier knowing explains, or bears some other\nspecial connection to, the later knowing. Any subject who remembers\nthat p at a moment knows that p then because she\nknew that p before.\n\nThe epistemic theory faces more than one danger. To begin, it is worth\nnoting that the different versions of the epistemic theory generally\nwill not be complete theories of remembering. They state just\nnecessary conditions on remembering, not sufficient conditions. They\nmight be correct, but they do not say all that remembering is. Indeed,\nthey often could say much more. Suppose remembering requires knowing\nbecause of past knowing. The \u201cbecause\u201d here masks an\nomission. How does one know at one time because of knowing at\nan earlier time? The most natural answer is: by memory. But we should\nhesitate to accept that answer here. The epistemic theory is supposed\nto be clarifying what remembering is. Paired with the natural answer,\nthe epistemic theory says roughly that to remember requires memory to\nconnect knowing with earlier knowing. The explanation of remembering\ncritically involves some residual, opaque memory activity. An\nexplanation minimally citing memory, or one further elucidating its\nactivity, might be more insightful.\n\nA more common criticism of the epistemic theory is that knowledge\nrequires something that remembering does not (Bernecker 2010; see also\nAudi 1995; Lai 2022). One form of the criticism goes as follows.\nKnowledge roughly requires good and undiminished reason to believe.\nSuppose you remember that p\u2014you\u2019ve come to know\nthat p and therefore have reason good enough for knowing that\np. Later you gain reason to doubt that p (see\ndiscussion of defeaters in\n Section 2.2.3).\n Your reason to believe that p is no longer good enough for\nknowing that p. But can you now remember that p? The\nepistemic theory must say, perhaps unintuitively, you cannot. Perhaps\neven worse, the epistemic theory seems to imply that you remembered\nthat p up until you gained the reason to doubt. So you\nrecently remembered that p, but can remember no longer, and\nnot because of any forgetting. It\u2019s because of some\nlearning\u2014your gaining reason to doubt. It may instead be more\nplausible to suppose the epistemic theory is mistaken. Remembering\ndoes not require good and undiminished reason to believe, in which\ncase it does not require knowing.\n\nAlso, if the epistemic theory is correct, there is no remembering\nfalsely. Knowledge requires truth. Remembering, if it requires\nknowing, also requires truth. Propositional misremembering,\nthen, isn\u2019t remembering at all. At best it\u2019s mere apparent\nremembering. It\u2019s not memory\u2019s doing. In other words,\nwhether a subject is remembering that p is not settled by the\nmechanisms that produce p as an output for the subject and by\nthe functions of those mechanisms. Instead, the accuracy of p\nalso matters for whether the subject counts as remembering. The\nepistemic theory is only as plausible as this consequence (cf. De\nBrigard 2014).\n\nFinally, the epistemic theory\u2019s prospects may depend on the\nempirical matter of whether and how memory is generative. Perhaps\nresearch in neuroscience and cognitive psychology could make it\nplausible that propositional remembering is in some cases generative.\nThis would doom at least the stronger versions of the epistemic\ntheory. Knowing that p in the past would be unnecessary for\nremembering that p now, if memory can generate p as\nthe content of some propositional remembering.\n\nDefenses of the epistemic theory tend to suggest that its alternatives\nare themselves flawed (Adams 2011; James 2017) or that the alleged\ncounterexamples to it are insufficiently clear (Moon 2013; Sakuragi\n2013).\n2. Memory and Justification\n\nWe seem to have epistemic justification for much of what we believe.\nAnd memory seems to play some role in our having this justification.\nSuppose appearances are correct here. Just what is memory\u2019s\nrole? What can memory do, what can\u2019t it do, and why? There are\nmany theories about the nature of epistemic justification, and they\nmight shed light on memory\u2019s role. Or things might work the\nother way around\u2014our intuitive judgments about memory\u2019s\nrole could shed light on which theories of justification are correct,\nand which we should abandon. This section begins to explore\nmemory\u2019s relationship with justification.\n2.1 Foundationalism and Coherentism\n\nOne way to illuminate memory\u2019s justificatory role is to turn the\nspotlight to the structure of justification. Some of what we\njustifiedly believe helps us justifiedly believe other things. But,\naccording to foundationalism, not all that justifies stands in need of\njustification itself. There are foundations for our justification,\nplaces where we need look for no further support. If there is\nfoundational justification, memory might provide some of it. Perhaps\nmemory is not relevantly different from perception, which is a good\ncandidate for being a basic source of justification. Visual perception\nprovides justification for believing how spatially distant things are.\nMemory simply provides justification for believing how temporally\ndistant things are (Taylor 1956).\n\nOr memory might not provide foundational support. Instead all support\nit gives might come from other justifiers; it does not sit at the\nbottom of the structure. Most contemporary epistemology accepts\nfoundationalism (see entry on\n foundationalist theories of justification).\n So, several sections below help locate memory in the foundationalist\nstructure. But there are alternatives to foundationalism.\n\nOne alternative is coherentism, according to which, roughly, a belief\nis justified if and only if it coheres with other beliefs (see entry\non\n coherentist theories of justification).\n Beliefs that fit together well are mutually supporting, or supporting\nas a set. Coherentism is not as popular as it once was, but still has\nsome advocates (Poston 2014). But even if coherentism is false,\ncoherence relations may still matter for justification. Coherence\nmight not create justification, but it may increase any already\npresent (Lewis 1946). Thanks to memory you might have several beliefs\nthat all fit together. If these beliefs are already justified, their\nfitting together could boost their justification. And even if\ncoherence does not help, incoherence may hurt (Audi 1995; Olsson\n2017). A poor fit among recollections might eliminate justification\nthat memory would otherwise help provide.\n2.2 Internalism and Externalism\n\nLearning can be understood as gaining evidence. And we seem to keep\nsome evidence over time. Presumably it is memory that does this\nkeeping. A natural way of understanding how memory helps us have\njustification centers on the evidence we have thanks to memory. This\nfits well with internalism about epistemic justification. Internalism\nsays a subject\u2019s justification is settled by her mental life.\nMentally identical subjects will be equally justified in having the\nsame doxastic attitudes toward the same propositions. Memory is part\nof the mental life. We needn\u2019t look beyond the evidence memory\nprovides to see how it helps us have justification.\n\nContrast internalism with externalism about epistemic justification,\nwhich says non-mental factors can result in differences in\njustification, even among mentally identical subjects (see entry on\n internalist vs. externalist conceptions of epistemic justification).\n According to externalism, something contingent that makes no\ndifference to a subject\u2019s mental life can make a difference to\nher justification. Her memory may tend to err, for example. This\ntendency has to do with facts external to the mind\u2014facts about\nhow for instance the past was. Perhaps if memory is to provide\njustification, it will tend to get these facts right.\n2.2.1 The Problem of Forgotten Evidence\n\nA few apparent epistemological problems of memory may favor\nexternalism over internalism. One of these is the problem of forgotten\nevidence (Goldman 1999; Harman 1986; Owens 1999; Pappas 1980; see also\nFrise 2015\n [Other Internet Resources];\n Huemer 1999; Madison 2017; McCain 2015). We tend to use evidence when\nforming justified beliefs. But we also tend to forget this evidence,\neven while continuing to believe. Pappas (1983: 266 n.1) thinks\n\u201cone typically loses one\u2019s original justification\u201d.\nWhen the originally justified belief is kept but the original evidence\nfor it is not, its justification might be replaced by other\njustification, or lost and not replaced, or not lost at all. In many\ncases it is intuitive that the kept belief is still justified one way\nor another. The problem of forgotten evidence is that of explaining\nhow this could be.\n\nSome externalist theories seem to have an explanation readily\navailable. One such theory is process reliabilism (see entry on\n reliabilist epistemology).\n Very roughly, it says a belief\u2019s justification depends on the\nreliability of the process that forms or keeps the belief. Memory\nseems relevantly reliable. Even if a subject forgets her original\nevidence for a belief that was originally justified and that she\nkeeps, she may keep the belief due to a reliable memory process.\nReliabilism appears able to explain how the belief is still\njustified\u2014it\u2019s because of the memory process\u2019s\nreliability.\n\nBut internalist theories have other resources. A subject may have\nforgotten her original evidence, but memory could still provide her\nwith something that justifies a belief she has kept and that was\noriginally justified: seeming recollection. A subject who seems to\nrecollect that p has prima facie justification for believing\nthat p (Pollock 1986). (Prima facie justification is an\nepistemic good that suffices for overall justification, as long as the\nsubject has no reason to doubt the belief or its justification). If\nthat\u2019s right, seeming recollection could provide justification\neven in a case of forgotten evidence. This recollection is a part of\nthe mental life, so internalism can appeal to it in solving the\nproblem of forgotten evidence.\n\nThere are different accounts of why seeming recollection justifies.\nThe phenomenology of a recollective experience may account for it\n(Feldman & Conee 2001; Madison 2014). Or the persistence of\nseeming recollection, even in the face of evidence of its inaccuracy,\nmay account for the justification (Brogaard 2017). Or, seeming\nrecollection that p may justify believing that p\nbecause it justifies believing something else that is relevant,\nnamely, that one justifiedly believed that p in that past\n(Schroer 2008).\n\nThere might be no relevant difference between, on the one hand,\nseeming to recollect or seeming to remember or\nseeming to recall and, on the other, recollecting or\nremembering or recalling. Seeming to recollect may be sufficient for\nremembering. But it is insufficient for knowing. (One might, after\nall, seem to recollect a falsehood, but one cannot know a falsehood.)\nIf seeming recollection suffices for remembering, then the epistemic\ntheory of memory appears mistaken. The epistemic theory, again, says\nthat a subject who remembers that p knows that p,\nperhaps because of her past knowing that p. But some seeming\nrecollection would allow remembering without knowing.\n2.2.2 The Problem of Stored Beliefs\n\nEven if seeming recollection solves one problem, it is a resource of\nlimited use. It does not obviously account for all the justification\nmemory provides. It is plausible that at any given time, thanks to\nmemory, we have a vast number of beliefs. But we are not seemingly\nrecollecting the content of all these beliefs. Indeed, at best we\nrecollect the content of few at any particular time. The beliefs we\nare not recollecting are sometimes called \u201cstored\u201d or\n\u201cdispositional\u201d or \u201cnonoccurrent\u201d. Some of\nthese beliefs are justified. The problem of stored beliefs is that of\naccounting for this justification. (Pappas 1980 discusses a\nknowledge-version of the problem).\n\nIf internalism is true, something mental other than seeming\nrecollection accounts for this justification. But it\u2019s at least\ninitially difficult to see what that might be (Goldman 1999; Senor\n1993; Moon 2012a presents internalism with a knowledge-version of the\nproblem). Externalist theories like reliabilism, however, can still\nsay the reliability of the memory process responsible for these stored\nbeliefs helps justify them.\n\nSeeming recollection apparently does not solve the problem of stored\nbeliefs. But something closely related might help. It\u2019s not just\nrecollecting, but being disposed to recollect, that helps\njustify (Audi 1995; Conee & Feldman 2011; Ginet 1975; McCain 2014;\nsee also Feldman 1988; Piazza 2009). Having a disposition to recollect\np provides justification for believing p. Typically,\na justified stored belief is one the subject is disposed to recall.\nThis disposition makes sense of the stored belief\u2019s\njustification. Or perhaps a seeming to recollect can itself have a\ndispositional status, just as a belief can have this status, and so\nseemings do justify the right stored beliefs after all (Madison\n2014).\n\nIt is controversial whether recollective dispositions justify. McGrath\n(2007) argues they do not, for if they do, it follows there is\njustification in some cases of forgetting where intuitively there is\nno justification. Kelly (2016) argues that what matters for\njustification is not a recollective disposition, but instead\nremembering, and not all remembering involves a recollective\ndisposition. Frise (2017a) argues that it is insufficiently clear just\nwhen a subject has a recollective disposition, and also that in some\ncases in which a subject is disposed to recall that p, the\njustified attitude for her toward p is nonetheless suspending\njudgment rather than believing. McGrath (2016) and Senor (1993) press\na more basic question: exactly why is a disposition to recollect\njustifying evidence?\n\nNot all attempts to solve the problem of stored beliefs appeal to\nrecollective dispositions or even to the reliability of the processes\nthat keep stored beliefs. One potential way out is neutral between\ninternalism and externalism. It denies there are stored beliefs at\nall, so there is no justification of stored beliefs to account for.\nFrise (2018a) argues that if representationalism\u2014a leading\ntheory on the nature of belief\u2014is true, then we have no stored\nbeliefs. This is because human memory turns out not to function in the\nways required for storing beliefs. According to representationalism,\nbelieving that p requires bearing a special relation to a\nmental representation that p (see entry on\n belief).\n Frise argues human memory does not store many representations, and\nthat our relation to stored representations is generally\nunderdetermined. Representationalism may be false. But if true, the\nproblem of stored beliefs is illusory.\n2.2.3 The Problem of Forgotten Defeat\n\nSeeming recollection seems to help solve the problem of forgotten\nevidence, but to help little with the problem of stored beliefs. And\nthere may be a further concern about whether seeming recollection\nhelps even with the first problem. The concern has to do with a\ndifferent sort of forgetting. A subject might form a belief without\njustification, and then keep the belief while forgetting how it came\nabout. Or, the subject might have some reason to believe that\np and some reason to doubt that p, and go on to\nbelieve that p and eventually forget the reason to doubt. A\nreason to doubt or not believe is sometimes called a\n\u201cdefeater\u201d . Forgetting a defeater, which here includes\nforgetting that a belief arose in the absence of justification, might\nmatter for overall justification. It might matter even for prima facie\njustification. The problem of forgotten defeat is that of accounting\nsatisfactorily for justification in cases of forgotten defeat.\n\nForgetting defeat is not pivotal if seeming recollection justifies.\nSuppose a subject who seems to recollect that p has prima\nfacie justification for believing that p. A subject might\nhave formed a belief that p without reason, kept the belief\nbut forgotten how it came about, and now seems to recollect that\np. The seeming recollection results in prima facie and\noverall justification, even though this is a case of forgotten defeat.\nIntuitions about whether there can be either sort of justification in\na case of forgotten defeat, then, bear on whether seeming recollection\njustifies. These intuitions, then, bear on whether the seeming\nrecollection solution to the problem of forgotten evidence is\nviable.\n\nMany deny that forgetting a defeater can result in an increase in\njustification (Annis 1980; Goldman 1999; 2009; Greco 2005; Huemer\n1999; Jackson 2011; Senor 2010, 2017; Teroni 2018). According to Senor\n(2010), a belief should not \u201cbecome justified simply on the\nbasis of being retained\u201d. But it appears this could occur when a\ndefeater is forgotten. According to Teroni (2018), a belief that\np with defeated justification has, when the defeater is\nforgotten, bad etiology. Seeming to recollect that p in a\ncase of forgotten defeat explains why the subject is inclined to judge\nthat p is true, but does not explain why this judging is\njustified. Jackson (2011: 569) puts it simplest: \u201cgarbage in,\ngarbage out\u201d. What memory delivers is no better than what it\noriginally received, regardless of any forgetting in the meantime.\nSenor (2007) offers further reason to deny forgotten defeat can\nincrease justification: there should be a kind of parity in the\npositive and negative effects of what we forget. Just as there is no\ndecrease in justification when we forget supporting evidence, there\nshould be no increase in justification when we forget reason to\ndoubt.\n\nAccording to others, forgetting a defeater can result in an increase\nin justification (Bernecker 2010; Feldman & Conee 2001; Dogramaci\n2015; Feldman 2005; Lackey 2005, 2007; McGrath 2007). For Feldman\n(2005) and McGrath (2007), one reason to suppose there is an increase\nin justification is that the subject might have lost reason to doubt.\nThe subject may then be left only with reason to believe, or at least\nwith no reason to stop believing. Believing looks like the best\noption. Feldman and Conee (2001) and Lackey (2007) argue that a\nsubject who knows herself to be a generally careful believer has\nsupport for a memory belief of uncertain origin, even when a defeater\nfor the belief has been forgotten. Lackey (2007) notes that forgetting\nevidence and forgetting defeaters can indeed have asymmetrical effects\non justification, so intuitions about cases of forgetting evidence can\nbe uninformative about cases of forgotten defeaters. Dogramaci (2015)\nargues that the pragmatic function of critical language is to promote\ntrustworthy testimony. But criticism will not promote that in normal\ncases of forgotten defeat. This is because the subject has forgotten\nwhy she originally formed her belief. So it is mistaken to identify\nthe forgetter\u2019s belief as unjustified.\n2.3 Time-slice and Historical Theories\n\nThe problems of forgotten evidence and forgotten defeat have to do\nwith the justification a subject has at one time, given what the\nsubject has forgotten since an earlier time. If these problems\naren\u2019t just superficial, the subject\u2019s past matters for\nher present justification in a nontrivial way. A trivial way\nthat it could matter is as follows: a subject had some justifying\nevidence at an earlier time, and her memory causes her to have this\nevidence now, and this evidence justifies her beliefs now. There is a\ntrivial connection here between the subject\u2019s present\njustification and her past, in that the subject\u2019s past only\nindirectly affects her present justification. It affects her present\njustification just by affecting what evidence she has in the present.\nBut ultimately it is just her evidence now that determines what\njustification she has now.\n\nIn short, some of the problems above draw attention to how a state of\naffairs at a time might directly matter for justification at another\ntime. If a subject can have justification for believing that\np now even if she has forgotten her original evidence for\np and has no other support for p now, it appears her\npast can directly affect her present justification. It is because she\nhad justification or justifying evidence that she\nhas justification. Similarly, if a subject who seems to\nrecall that p can fail to have justification for believing\nthat p now because she has forgotten a defeater for\np, her past seems to directly affect her present\njustification.\n\nIt is not obvious just how time and justification connect, and the\nrole memory plays in this connection. The basic options are few. Here\nare some: it could be that all that directly matters for justification\nat a time is how things are at that time. Call a theory that implies\nthis a time-slice theory of justification. Or, it could be\nthat past states of affairs also directly matter for justification at\nthat time. Call a theory that implies this a historical\ntheory of justification. (See Kelly 2016 and Moss 2015 for further\ndiscussion). A less explored possibility is that future states of\naffairs directly matter for justification at a time\u2014but since\ntime-slice and historical theories are the two most popular\ncandidates, this entry focuses on them. To include memory in these\noptions, and to center on the present: perhaps memory affects a\nsubject\u2019s justification now only by way of how her memory\ncurrently is or is active\u2014for example what a subject now recalls\nor is disposed to recall or otherwise has tucked away in memory. Or,\nperhaps what was once a part of a subject\u2019s memory also matters\nfor her justification now even if it is not in her memory now. Or\nperhaps what she will later remember matters for her justification\nnow.\n\nNote that the time-slice and historical distinction crosscuts the\ninternalism and externalism distinction. Wherever a theory of\njustification lands in one distinction, it could land anywhere in the\nother. For example, an internalist theory of justification can state\nthat just the way a subject is now, including the way her memory is\nnow, directly matters for her justification now (Feldman & Conee\n2001). Or it could state that elements of her past, including its\ninfluence on a subject\u2019s memory, directly matter for her\njustification now (Huemer 1999; McGrath 2007, 2016). Some combinations\nare more common and perhaps more plausible than others. Internalists\nmore often favor time-slice views, while externalists more often favor\nhistorical views. Goldman\u2019s (2009) reliabilism is a paradigm\nexternalist, historical view: a memory belief\u2019s current\njustificatory status is chiefly a matter of memory preserving the\nbelief\u2019s past status, and that the past status is partially\ndetermined by factors external to the subject, such as the reliability\nof the process that originally formed the belief. An externalist\ntheory could be time-slice, but that is less common.\n\nTime-slice theories have some assets. For one, they are relatively\nsimple. On a time-slice theory, what explains a subject\u2019s\njustification at a time is just the way things are then. It is more\ncomplicated to identify the way things are at other times as also\nbeing relevant. Moreover, the way things are at a time might fully\nexplain a subject\u2019s justification then. For example, a\nsubject\u2019s recollective dispositions and what she seems to\nrecollect at a time might account for all her justification from\nmemory then. Appealing to the past seems unnecessary. And it\u2019s\nplausible that a simpler explanation, all else being equal, is better.\nSo time-slice theories, all else being equal, appear better than\nhistorical theories, since the latter cite the past as also directly\nmattering for a subject\u2019s present justification. Another asset\nof time-slice theories may be this. Two subjects can have different\npasts but be identical in the present. They at the moment have all the\nsame beliefs, memories, experiences, and so on. Because they are the\nsame now, it might seem that they are the same with respect to what\nthey are justified in believing, disbelieving, and suspending judgment\nin now. But if that\u2019s right, their differing pasts don\u2019t\nmatter (Moon 2012b). If the differences in their pasts don\u2019t\nmatter, it appears their pasts don\u2019t matter at all. And if\nsubject\u2019s past doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s hard to see what\nelse about the past could matter. Justification in the present is\nsettled just by how things are. Similarly, it might seem that a past\nthat a subject currently has no memory of shouldn\u2019t matter for\nher present justification (Feldman & Conee 2001).\n\nBut historical theories might have their own merits. For example, the\ncausal history of a belief appears relevant to its justification in\nthe present (Goldman 1979). It is not just the immediate cause of a\nbelief that counts. How a belief originated and has since been kept in\nmemory, and what justificatory status it has had along the way, might\nseem to directly bear on its justificatory status now. An historical\ntheory of justification can accommodate these intuitions, while a\ntime-slice theory must deny that the causal history of a belief\nmatters as such. For the time-slice theory, this history could matter\nfor justification in the present only indirectly, insofar as it\naffects the world in the present. The past, including past memory,\ndoesn\u2019t matter for justification, except insofar as it affects\nthe present, which does matter for justification.\n\nHistorical theories may have an easier time explaining how reasoning\nis able to provide justification. Most reasoning is temporally\nextended. It takes place over time. Burge (1993: 463) says that\n\u201cAny reasoning in time must rely on memory\u201d. To reason to\na supported conclusion, presumably all steps of reasoning along the\nway need to be supported too. Burge (2003: 300) thinks that it is\nmemory that holds any support for past steps constant during later\nsteps of the reasoning. When arriving at a supported conclusion, the\nsubject might not be thinking about evidence for the earlier steps in\nthe reasoning or doing anything else that would support these steps.\nThe subject must be inheriting support for these steps from the past\nvia memory. The subject\u2019s current step of reasoning\ncouldn\u2019t itself fully support the conclusion. We must cite the\nsupport that memory ushers in from the past for previous reasoning\nsteps.\n\nBuoying historical theories further, Kelly (2016) looks at a case of\nextended reasoning that involves a nontrivial error. At the end this\nreasoning the subject may end up mentally identical to a subject who\nreasoned without error. (The rest of the world at that time may be\nidentical too.) It\u2019s plausible that the subjects are unequal in\ntheir justification, since one of them reasoned erroneously and the\nother didn\u2019t. But because the subjects are identical mentally at\nthe later time, a time-slice theory must say the subjects are\nidentical in their justification then.\n\nAnnis (1980) thinks historical theories are better at accounting for\nthe justification that children have. A child\u2019s current mind may\nnot yet be sophisticated enough to explain how some of her current\njustified beliefs in memory are indeed justified. Rather, what\njustifies these beliefs now must be found in the past. Annis also\nargues time-slice theories flounder on the problems of forgotten\nevidence and forgotten defeat.\n\nOne historical theory of particular note is epistemic conservatism\n(Harman 1986; McCain 2008, 2019; McGrath 2007, 2016; Poston 2014).\nAccording to epistemic conservatism, a subject who believes a\nproposition has some prima facie reason to continue believing it.\nUnless a subject has reason to drop her belief, she has some\njustification for keeping it. This theory is historical because it\nsays having a belief at one time directly results in having\njustification for it later. Past believing matters for justification\nin the present. Notably, this theory is also friendly toward\ninternalism, and it is internalists rather than externalists who tend\nto be friendly toward it. It identifies elements of the past that\naffect the subject\u2019s present justification, but these elements\nare all mental, namely, the subject\u2019s past beliefs. McGrath\n(2007) brings epistemic conservatism to bear on a range of\nepistemological problems of memory. He (2007: 14) thinks it solves the\nproblem of forgotten evidence. A subject may have forgotten her\noriginal evidence for her belief that p, and yet it might be\nintuitive that this belief is still justified. Epistemic conservatism\ncan explain why: the subject had already believed that p, and\nthis past believing, in the absence of a defeater, is enough for her\nbelief to be justified now. McGrath (2007: 21) also thinks epistemic\nconservatism solves the problem of stored beliefs. A justified belief\nthat is stored in memory is presumably one that was believed a moment\nago too. Believing then explains why the belief is justified now.\n\nThis solution to the problem of stored beliefs faces challenges (Frise\n2017a). A subject, Ric, may have justified stored beliefs. An evil\ndemon could bring about another subject, Vic, who is mentally\nidentical to Ric. When Vic comes about, he too has stored beliefs. But\nhe had no beliefs prior to existing. Epistemic conservatism does not\nexplain how any of his stored beliefs could be justified at the moment\nof his creation. And there is reason to think some are justified\nthen\u2014Vic is Ric\u2019s mental twin, and Ric\u2019s has\njustified stored beliefs then. What\u2019s more, Vic might not change\nat all mentally from the moment of his creation to the next moment.\nBut because Vic has beliefs at this first moment, according to\nepistemic conservatism, he has prima facie justification for them at\nthe second moment. Epistemic conservatism explains the justification\nof his stored beliefs at the second time but not the first, even\nthough he is his own mental duplicate at these times.\n\nEpistemic conservatism may also solve the problem of forgotten defeat\n(McGrath 2016). When a subject has forgotten all defeaters, she has no\nreason to abandon belief. For her to change from believing to not\nbelieving for no reason looks unreasonable. Keeping the belief looks\nreasonable. Epistemic conservatism explains this, as it says in the\nabsence of defeat the past believing results in justification for\ncontinuing to believe. Beliefs in memory that aren\u2019t based on\nother beliefs are \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d (McGrath\n2016: 80).\n\nEpistemic conservatism and certain other historical theories may face\na problem specifically concerning memory. Suppose a subject\njustifiedly forms a belief that p. Later, she remembers that\np. The remembering might justify believing that p.\nBut historical theories like epistemic conservatism say that past\nbelieving or past justified believing confers justification via\nmemory. So it looks like the remembering subject now has two sources\nof justification for the belief that p: the remembering and\nthe past believing. If having these two sources increases\njustification, it appears that memory is boosting the\njustification. Remembering can ratchet up justification. But that\nseems incorrect (Bernecker 2008; Huemer 1999).\n\nThere may not be a boost in justification in this sort of case,\nhowever, but rather an overdetermination of belief (McGrath 2007).\nThere are two justifying causes for the belief. It doesn\u2019t\nfollow that the belief has more justification than if it had one\njustifying cause. One nuanced version of epistemic conservatism offers\nanother response. On it, belief that p confers justification\nfor continuing to believe that p only if the subject has no\nevidence for or against p (Poston 2014). If remembering that\np is evidence for p, then the past believing is not\njustifying the subject in continuing to believe that p. On\nthis response, then, the case of remembering while retaining past\nbelief involves only one source of justification. So there\u2019s no\nboost upon remembering.\n\nA variation of the boost objection is that a subject might retain her\noriginal justifying evidence for p, and might thanks to\nmemory believe that p. It might appear that on epistemic\nconservatism, the subject again has two sources of justification. But\nthe subject should not have any degree of justification beyond what\nthe original evidence confers. One reply to this boost objection is\nthat believing while retaining the original evidence here may not\nresult in a greater degree of justification, but simply result in\njustification that is more difficult to defeat (McGrath 2016: 81).\n\nThe most popular and influential historical theory of justification is\nprocess reliabilism. As noted, it links the justification of a belief\nwith the reliability of the process that yields the belief. One\nsufficient condition it states for justified belief puts memory and\nthe past in the forefront. A process that yields beliefs could have a\nrange of types of inputs. Some of these inputs could themselves be\nbeliefs. An inferential process, for example, takes beliefs as inputs\nand yields a belief. Reliabilism says that if these input beliefs are\njustified, and the process has a certain kind of reliability (namely,\nit tends to yield true belief when the belief inputs are true), then\nthe resulting belief is justified (Goldman 1979). This helps explain\nhow memory can justify, and how the past directly matters for present\njustification. Some memory processes are reliable in the relevant way.\nAnd a memory process can take a past justified belief that p\nas an input and yield belief that p as an output later.\n(Continuously believing that p via memory may be due to a\nmemory process feeding the belief that p into itself.) The\noutput belief is, according to reliabilism, therefore justified.\n\nReliabilism might solve several epistemological problems of memory\n(Goldman 2009, 2011; Senor 1993, 2010). Consider the problem of\nforgotten evidence. On reliabilism, forgetting the original evidence\nfor a belief need not compromise its justification. If the belief was\njustified and has been kept by a suitably reliable process, it is\njustified now. And consider the problem of stored beliefs. On\nreliabilism a belief that is stored in memory can be justified in the\nsame way as in cases of forgotten evidence, even if nothing in the\nsubject\u2019s current mental life is justifying evidence for the\nbelief. Finally, consider the problem of forgotten defeat. Suppose a\nsubject had a defeater that eliminated all her justification for a\nbelief. The belief that enters memory is unjustified. The belief may\nbe an input to a suitably reliable memory process, but because the\ninput belief itself is unjustified not all inputs to the process are\njustified. So even if the defeater is forgotten, reliabilism is not\nimplying here that the output of this memory process is justified; the\nsufficient condition for justification has not been met. Reliabilism\ncan deliver the result that there is no justification in a case of\nforgotten defeat, and maybe that result is correct. Reliabilism faces\nmany criticisms (BonJour 1980; Cohen 1984; Conee & Feldman 1998;\nFrise 2018d). But many think it fares well in the epistemology of\nmemory.\n2.4 Preservationism and Generativism\n\nReliabilism and epistemic conservatism differ considerably. Still,\nthere is common ground, and not just because both are historical\ntheories. They agree that the past matters for present justification\nin a specific way; they each imply a thesis sometimes called\n\u201cpreservationism\u201d. More than one thesis in the\nepistemology of memory bears this name, however (Frise\u00a02015\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n It is important to see how they are distinct.\n\nOne thesis called \u201cpreservationism\u201d has to do with how\nmemory is not or does not function like a traditional foundational\nsource of justification, such as perception. The thesis, roughly, is\nthat memory can at best preserve justification from other sources of\njustification, but memory cannot generate justification. At its core\nthis thesis is about a limit to memory\u2019s justificatory power.\nMemory does not generate justification. It might preserve\njustification, but perhaps it fails at even that. Strictly speaking,\nthis preservationism itself has no implications about whether the past\ndirectly matters for justification in the present. In other words, the\nthesis need not be historical, though it usually is bundled together\nwith historical views.\n\nA distinct thesis called \u201cpreservationism\u201d has to do with\nmemory\u2019s justificatory power, not a limit to its power. It\nstates, roughly, that a belief entering memory with justification\nkeeps it. Memory sustains justification when sustaining a belief that\nhad justification. This thesis itself says nothing about whether\nmemory can or cannot generate justification. When stated carefully\nthis preservationism is typically an historical theory of\njustification. Memory delivers justification in the present to a\nbelief that it keeps and that had justification in the past. Like the\nother thesis called \u201cpreservationism\u201d, this thesis is also\noften bundled together with other views, and sometimes the two\npreservationisms are endorsed at once, which can obscure that they are\nseparable.\n\nThe second preservationism is the common ground between reliabilism\nand epistemic conservatism, at least if memory is relevantly reliable\n(Frise 2017b). Suppose a reliable memory process receives as an input\nonly a justified belief that p, and yields belief that\np as an output. Reliabilism implies that the output belief is\njustified. Memory is delivering justification to a belief it held onto\nand that had justification. And epistemic conservatism says even mere\nbelieving provides justification for retaining belief. Justified\nbelieving must be able to do as much.\n2.4.1 Preservationism as Anti-generativism\n\nBecause these preservationist theses are distinct they merit separate\ndiscussion. The lion\u2019s share of the literature on\npreservationism is on the first thesis: memory can at best preserve\njustification, but cannot generate it. Preservationism of this stripe\nis popular (Annis 1980; Goldman 2009, 2011; Jackson 2011; Naylor 2015;\nOwens 2000; Senor 2007, 2010). While there are arguments for this\nview, it sometimes is treated as though it has a default status. It\nhas borne the crown since it was born. Arguments for it are\nunnecessary. Opposing views, rather, are what require arguments.\nPerhaps preservationism has attained this status because it seems\nintuitive or simply common sense to many. And it is not hard to see\nwhy it seems like common sense, given our common sense understanding\nof how memory works: memory accumulates and keeps information from\nother sources. It\u2019s not adding information. It\u2019s only\nnatural that memory would at best accumulate and keep justification\nfrom these sources. It\u2019s not adding justification.\n\nThe main view that denies this preservationism says, roughly, that\nmemory can generate justification. Aptly enough, this view is called\n\u201cgenerativism\u201d (or \u201cgenerationism\u201d; Michaelian\n2011b). If memory can generate justification, one plausible way it\nmight do so is by way of remembering or seeming to recollect. As\nnoted, some responses to the problems of forgotten evidence and stored\nbeliefs are that seeming recollection, or perhaps also a disposition\nto recollect, can justify. If a subject\u2019s seeming to recollect\nthat p results in her having justification for believing\np that she did not previously have, memory appears to be\ngenerating this justification. Unsurprisingly, generativism is popular\namong those who think seeming recollection justifies. Because\npreservationism and generativism deny each other, and generativism is\nthe positive thesis and preservationism the negative, preservationism\nis sometimes called \u201canti-generativism\u201d (Frise 2015\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nIn favor of preservationism over generativism, Senor (2010) says\nmemory\u2019s job is preservative, both with respect to\nbelief and the justificatory status of belief. Naylor (2015) and Senor\n(2017) think preservationism helps explain what happens with stored\nbeliefs, in a way that might help solve the problem of stored beliefs.\nPresumably, the justification of stored beliefs does not increase\nsimply by the beliefs being stored in memory. And this is what\npreservationism predicts. Preservationism also seems to help with the\nproblem of forgotten defeat. In a case of forgotten defeat, a subject\nforgets a defeater for the justification of a belief. Goldman (2009)\nand Jackson (2011) find it plausible that memory will not increase the\njustification of that belief. And preservationism seems to predict\njust this too. Senor (2017) adds that, even if memory can generate\njustification, this is rare. More often, memory inherits justification\nfrom other sources.\n\nNuanced versions of and arguments for generativism abound. In favor of\ngenerativism over preservationism, Owens (1996) and Lackey (2005,\n2007) cite cases of recalled but previously unattended to information.\nA subject may witness an event, and store in memory certain details\nabout it that she does not notice until later. Only well after the\nevent does she remember the details and form a belief about them. The\nbelief seems justified, and memory is generating this justification.\nMichaelian (2011b) notes that in this sort of case, however, memory\nhad stored information and then generated new justified belief in it.\nBut the information was not new. Bernecker (2010) notes that\nthe justification from memory in this sort of case is merely doxastic,\nnot propositional (it is the justification of an attitude, not\njustification for having the attitude). The propositional\njustification for the believing the remembered details originated from\nperception at the time of witnessing the event, not from memory.\n\nMichaelian (2011b) argues that memory can do more. It can generate new\ncontent and, on reliabilism, new justification for belief in it,\nbecause memory is reliable. (Similarly, Huemer 1999 argues that\nseeming to remember can generate new justification for belief in new\ncontent.) Fern\u00e1ndez argues (2016) that memory can generate new\njustification for belief in specific new content. He argues\nthat an episodic memory contains information about how the memory\nitself originates from earlier perception of the way the world was.\nThis information about the memory\u2019s origin is new\u2014it was\nnot part of content of the earlier perception of the world. Memory\ngenerates this new content and, because memory is reliable, it can\ngenerate justification for believing the new content.\n\nLackey (2005) and Bernecker (2010) identify another sort of case in\nfavor of generativism. A subject may have a misleading defeater for\nthe justification for her belief that p. The defeater can\nthen be lost (perhaps due to forgetting). Thanks to memory the subject\nstill has the original justification for believing that p. So\nit looks like the subject\u2019s belief that p, thanks to\nmemory, is now justified. Senor (2007) points out that the\njustification in this sort of case is overall, but not prima facie.\nMemory is not generating new support, but is instead preserving\npreviously defeated support that then ceases to be defeated.\n\nBernecker and Grundmann (2019), in support of generativism, cite cases\nof incomplete remembering. Here, memory pares down the content of a\nbelief that may not have been acquired well. Incomplete remembering\ncan make up for the initial poor belief formation, perhaps by\nsimplifying the believed information and thus making it more likely\ntrue. The original belief may not have been reliably formed. But\nincomplete remembering reliably forms a new belief, and so the belief\nis justified. This justification originates from memory.\n\nFrise (2021) argues an extreme form of generativism follows from\nreliabilism. The extreme form says memory can generate justification\neven for an otherwise unjustified belief. On reliabilism, memory does\nthis by overdetermining belief. Memory might preserve a\nsubject\u2019s belief that p that had been formed without\njustification. Independently of her already believing that p,\nthe subject might now reconstructively recollect that p. For\nthat reason also she believes that p. This recollection is\nreliable. On reliabilism, the belief is now justified. But if\nthat\u2019s right, then reliabilism is less historical of a theory\nthan it had seemed. Memory does not always preserve a belief\u2019s\npast justificatory status. If the case of overdetermined belief counts\nas a case of forgotten defeat, then even reliabilism allows for\njustification in cases of forgotten defeat.\n\nGenerativism and preservationism may be able to broker an uneasy\ntruce. Perhaps certain types of memory (such as episodic memory) can\ngenerate justification but others (such as semantic memory) only\npreserve it (Teroni 2014). Perhaps memory can generate justification\nfor new beliefs but not for unjustified beliefs it simply stores\n(Huemer 1999; Senor 2017). Or perhaps memory can generate\njustification, but not knowledge (Audi 2002).\n2.4.2 Preservationism as an Historical Theory\n\nThe other thesis called \u201cpreservationism\u201d says, again,\nthat a belief in memory keeps its justification over time. If a\nsubject believes that p with justification at one time, and\nher belief that p stays in memory later, then her belief that\np is prima facie justified at the later time. There is less\ndiscussion of this preservationist thesis than the other. But it is at\nleast as popular as the other. Its proponents are numerous (Annis\n1980; Bernecker 2008; Burge 1997; Goldman 2009, 2011; Harman 1986;\nHuemer 1999; McGrath 2007; Naylor 2012; Owens 1999; Pappas 1980; Senor\n2010). A knowledge version of this preservationism thesis is also\npopular (Locke 1971; Malcolm 1963; Martin 2001; Shoemaker 1967).\n\nPreservationism is attractive in part because it may help with a kind\nof skepticism (Shoemaker 1967). We find ourselves with many beliefs,\nand many of them seem justified. What accounts for their\njustification? Our present support for those beliefs may not fully\nexplain their justification. But if beliefs inherit justification from\nthe past, that might explain the justification of many in the present.\nSimilarly, preservationism seems to help with the problems of\nforgotten evidence and stored beliefs (Goldman 2009, 2011). Even if a\nsubject forgets the original justifying evidence for her belief,\nmemory hangs on to the past justifiedness of the belief in the\npresent. If a subject has a belief stored in memory that had been\njustified, memory hangs on to its justification, even if nothing in\nthe subject\u2019s current mental life justifies the belief.\nPreservationism also fits with a natural understanding of\nmemory\u2019s main function, namely, that it is preservative. Memory\nstores information and attitudes toward information. It\u2019s\nplausible that memory also stores the justificatory status of these\nattitudes.\n\nNote that this version of preservationism is compatible with\ngenerativism; this helps illustrate how the two versions of\npreservationism are distinct. On this version of preservationism,\nmemory keeps justification in certain cases. But this version says\nnothing about the limits to memory\u2019s justificatory\npower. It could be that memory also generates justification in some\nother cases, as generativism says it can. This version of\npreservationism is incompatible, however, with time-slice theories of\njustification. Preservationism here allows a subject to have\njustification at one time because she had it at another time. The way\nthe subject or world is now does not fully explain why the\nsubject has justification now. Rather, the way the subject or world\nwas directly affects her justification now. But on a\ntime-slice theory of justification, nothing outside a time directly\nmatters for justification at that time.\n\nWhile this preservationism is a standard view, problems for it have\nbubbled to the surface. Three problems concern preservationism\u2019s\nconsequences for the degree of justification that memory\nallegedly preserves. Justification may not simply be binary (fully\npresent or absent), but instead come in a range of greater and lesser\nstrengths. If preservationism has implications about the degree to\nwhich memory preserves justification, the most natural view is that\nthe degree of justification stays the same. But according to Huemer\n(1999: 354) \u201cThe passage of time introduces new possibilities of\nerror; therefore, it lowers one\u2019s justification for believing a\nproposition\u201d. The idea is that as time goes on memory could be\nerring, and so this possibility diminishes justification over time.\nYet preservationism seems to say the degree of justification stays\nfixed.\n\nIt is not entirely clear which possible errors this problem centers\non, nor whether the mere passage of time matters. Suppose just a\nmoment has passed\u2014must justification decrease? Perhaps only\nlonger intervals of time matter. But suppose two subjects start out\nthe same mentally, and end up the same again mentally, but only after\nnotably unequal amounts of time (e.g., it takes one subject a year to\nend up mentally as the other subject is after just an hour). Perhaps\nnot even a longer interval itself results in less justification.\n\nHere is a second problem for preservationism that has to do with\ndegrees of justification (Frise 2017b). Suppose a subject formed a\njustified belief that p in the past and still believes that\np, and has no relevant defeaters. The subject now wonders\nwhether p is true, but does not recall. Does this failure to\nrecall lower the subject\u2019s justification for believing\np? If so, it is hard to explain this lowering of\njustification in a way that is friendly to preservationism; rival\ntheories offer simpler explanations. If not, preservationism has\nstrange results. In a case of retrieval failure it allows a\nsubject\u2019s belief that p to be as justified as it would\nbe if she had successfully recalled that p. But had the\nsubject only dimly recalled that p, presumably her\njustification would be lower than if she had successfully recalled\nthat p. It then follows that dimly recalling is worse than\ntrying and not recalling at all. Dim recollection results in less\njustification than failed recollection does, on preservationism.\n\nA final problem concerning preservationism and degrees of\njustification has to do with forgetting (BonJour 2016; Kelly 2016). A\nsubject might forget evidence that had justified her belief that\np to a very high degree. It\u2019s plausible that forgetting\nthis evidence should at least somewhat affect the degree of\njustification she has for p. But preservationism runs afoul\nof this if it implies that the high degree of justification remains.\nThe level of justification might decay over time in cases of forgotten\nevidence. Still, perhaps it never fully decays. If it does not, a\nversion of preservationism without implications about degrees of\njustification still stands (Goldman 2016).\n\nBut this version of preservationism still has other troubles. For one,\nit is at best an incomplete account of our justification from memory\n(Salvaggio 2018). Memory appears to be reconstructive, generating new\ncontent. And we often believe this new content. If any belief from\nmemory in new content is justified, preservationism doesn\u2019t say\nhow. It only explains how a preexisting belief can be justified.\nAnother trouble is this. Preservationism allows that a belief that\np can be justified now for a subject who has forgotten her\noriginal justifying evidence for p, and who has no other\nsupport for p. But suppose the subject learns something that\ndiscredits her original but forgotten evidence (Frise 2017b). Is her\nbelief that p still justified? If so, then preservationism\nallows an odd grandfathering of past justification; recently\ndefeated evidence can\u2019t justify now, but old justification from\nrecently defeated evidence remains. But if her belief that p\nis no longer justified, then preserved justification can disappear\nfrom seemingly arbitrary learning. A subject can lose justification\nfor her belief that p by learning something unimportant to\np or to her evidence for p.\n3. Justification and Beyond\n\nThis section continues to explore memory\u2019s relationship to\njustification and other epistemic goods. It does so by touching on\nmemory\u2019s relationship to testimony, the extended mind,\nmetacognition, knowledge-how, forgetting, and skepticism.\n3.1 Testimony and Memory\n\nMemory may have a special connection to testimony (see entry on\n epistemological problems of testimony).\n There is debate about whether the two have similar epistemic\nfunctions (Burge 1993; Lackey 2005; Malmgren 2006). Supposing they do,\nit is a further question what those functions are. Perhaps neither\ngenerates knowledge or certain other epistemic goods (Audi 1997). It\ncould be that a speaker\u2019s testimony can pass on knowledge to a\nhearer, but cannot create knowledge for the hearer when the speaker\nlacks it. In a way, testimony is not a foundational source of\nknowledge or justification. If preservationism (as anti-generativism)\nis true, memory is not a source either. Or, perhaps both can generate\nknowledge. Or, perhaps memory and testimony simply have distinct\nepistemic functions.\n\nAnother possible connection: memory is a kind of testimony.\nSpecifically, memory may merely be testimony to your current self from\nyour past self. Remembering is like reading your own diary. Your\njustification for believing what you seem to remember depends on your\nbackground justification for trusting your prior judgments and\ntrusting memory to indicate these judgments. This parallels a simple\nview about justification from testimony. Your justification for\nbelieving someone\u2019s testimony depends on your background\njustification for trusting what the testifier believes and trusting\nthis person\u2019s testimony to indicate her beliefs.\n\nThe diary view of memory may be wrong. It fits poorly with cases in\nwhich a subject recalls two beliefs that originally were unequal in\njustification but does not recall her original reasons for these\nbeliefs. The diary view of memory here counts the beliefs as equally\njustified. So it must contend that the reasons for the beliefs have\nchanged, even when it is stipulated that the subject has neither\nlearned nor forgotten anything relevant. The diary view incorrectly\ntreats some testimony from your former self equally (Barnett 2015).\nHere\u2019s another reason to doubt that memory is a kind of\ntestimony. When memory reports p, this is evidence that\np, rather than evidence about what memory reports (Weatherson\n2015). But when a testifier reports p, this isn\u2019t\nevidence that p, but rather evidence about what the testifier\nreports.\n\nIt could be that memory has a special connection to testimony, but one\nthat is problematic. Sometimes a subject experiences an event, and\nafterwards hears misleading testimony about the event. The subject may\nlater incorporate the content of that testimony when constructively\nrecollecting the event, and for that reason form a false belief about\nthe event. This is the much-discussed \u201cmisinformation\neffect\u201d (Loftus 1979 [1996]). Less discussed is the\n\u201cinformation effect\u201d. Here, the subject hears accurate\ntestimony about an event she has witnessed, and that testimony shapes\nhow she later reconstructively recollects the event, leading to a true\nbelief. Although the belief is accurate, it\u2019s accuracy may be\ndue to a kind of luck that prevents knowledge; at best this is a\n\u201cGettier case\u201d (see entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n Michaelian (2013) argues that when the information effect occurs, not\nonly does memory\u2019s reliability increase, but knowledge is also\nstill possible. The information effect does not involve\nproblematic luck. According to Shanton (2011), constructive\nrecollection in general is unreliable and leads to false belief in a\nnearby possible world. But she suggests it is more plausible that this\nrecollection can still yield knowledge, than that knowledge requires\neither reliability or no false belief in close worlds.\n3.2 Extended Mind\n\nCognitive processing may not be limited to biological\nbrain-processing. It may extend also to artifacts inside the skull, or\neven outside. A subject\u2019s notebook, for example, may be a part\nof his cognitive processing, in the way his memory is part of his\ncognitive processing (Clark & Chalmers 1998). Information stored\nin the notebook can be part of the subject\u2019s dispositional\nmemory knowledge (Carter & Kallestrup 2016). The subject does not\ninstead merely relearn the information upon accessing it. Knowledge\nmay not only extend to memory technology, but this knowledge may in\nways be better than knowledge from biomemory (Carter 2018; Heersmink\n& Carter 2020). It may for example be more stable and less\neffortful to maintain. Michaelian (2012a), however, argues that an\nimportant case for the extended cognition hypothesis fails. The case\nhighlights functional similarity between biomemory and alleged memory\nthat is external to the subject\u2019s body. The case specifically\nhas to do with their similar, purely preservative functioning. But,\nMichaelian argues, biomemory lacks this function, so alleged external\nmemory is not relevantly similar to biomemory after all. Notably, the\nview that biomemory has a purely preservative function has in part\nmotivated views about its epistemic powers, such as both versions of\npreservationism.\n3.3 Metacognition\n\nWe are not only cognitively active creatures, but we also monitor and\ncontrol our own cognitive activity, typically unreflectively. This\nmonitoring and controlling is metacognition. Memory involves\nmetacognition (Arango-Mu\u00f1oz 2013, 2014; Arango-Mu\u00f1oz\n& Michaelian 2014; Michaelian 2012b; Proust 2013). Thanks to\nmemory we retrieve information, but then we also evaluate it and our\nown retrieval of it. For example the information may not indicate its\norigin, and we use heuristics to determine a probable\none\u2014experience as opposed to, say, imagination. We also monitor\nhow quickly or slowly we retrieve the information, and our epistemic\nfeelings toward it (such as, say, a feeling of knowing). An\nendorsement mechanism controls for example whether we continue or\ncease to seek from memory the desired information.\n\nMichaelian (2012b) argues that the metacognitive endorsement mechanism\nis reliable and justifying despite its relying on sources of\ninformation that do not always deliver accurate information.\nMichaelian (2012c) argues that metacognitive monitoring helps\none\u2019s own memory to function reliably, yet that monitoring\ntestifiers for untrustworthiness is unimportant to testimony\u2019s\nreliability. Proust (2013) thinks metacognition helps us have\njustification, but contends that internalism about epistemic\njustification struggles to explain how this is so. Frise (2018c)\nargues that metacognition in memory supports a kind of internalism\nabout epistemic justification over process reliabilism.\n3.4 Knowledge-How\n\nThis entry has discussed memory and knowledge, but only one type of\nknowledge. The type is knowledge-that, or propositional knowledge.\nWhat is known here is, or has the form of, a proposition. Maria knows\nthat the 49ers should have won Super Bowl LIV, and this is\npropositional knowledge, or knowledge-that. Another type of knowledge\nis knowledge-how (see entry on\n knowledge how).\n Maria knows how to throw a football. This is knowledge-how.\n\nThere is much discussion of how these two types of knowledge relate. A\nstandard view is that they are importantly distinct types. A\ncontroversial view, however, is that knowledge-how consists in or\nrequires knowledge-that. This view is intellectualism. The\nphilosophy and psychology of memory might shed light on how the two\ntypes of knowledge relate. There is evidence that the two types rely\non distinct memory systems (Michaelian 2011c). Not all knowledge-how\ninvolves knowledge-that. Thus, intellectualism appears false.\nAdditionally, memory for how to execute physical actions, or\nremembering-how, appears closely related to knowledge-how.\nRemembering-how can endure longer than related propositional\nknowledge, allowing individuals with dementia to retain certain skills\n(Sutton & Williamson 2014). If remembering-how suffices for\nknowledge-how, this may be further evidence against intellectualism.\nThe subject has lost the knowledge-that while keeping the relevant\nknowledge-how.\n3.5 Forgetting\n\nForgetting is normatively significant. Not only does some of it invite\nmoral blame (Bernecker 2018), but it is essential to the\nepistemological problems of forgotten evidence and forgotten defeat.\nBut it is not entirely clear what forgetting is. And surprisingly\nlittle work addresses the nature of forgetting. Some forgetting is a\nprocess, other forgetting is a mental state; forgetting might have\ndifferent types of content (e.g., a proposition or an event or an\nexperience); forgetting involves some characteristic relation to its\ncontent that distinguishes it from other processes or states with the\nsame content; forgetting has some scale, either binary or a further\ngraded range (Frise 2018b).\n\nIt might seem commonsensical that forgetting, whatever it is exactly,\nis incompatible with knowing. What you forget, you no longer know. But\nperhaps sometimes a subject forgets what she still knows (Moon 2012b;\nPappas 1983, 1987). The forgetting may involve trying but failing to\nmentally access previously learned information. The information may be\nmentally accessible to the subject via her memory. The subject fails\nto access it, however. She still dispositionally knows what\nshe\u2019s forgetting. Other ways of forgetting are harder to square\nwith knowing. For example, some forgetting involves information being\nlost. And it\u2019s plausible that a subject does not still know\ninformation that she has lost.\n\nForgetting appears to be an epistemic defect, in part because some\nforgetting appears incompatible with knowing. It would be better not\nto forget, because not forgetting would allow for more\nknowing.\u00a0However forgetting might be a feature of a virtuously\nfunctioning memory system (Michaelian 2011a). Not forgetting, or too\nlittle forgetting, would be a problem. The problem wouldn\u2019t be\nthat human memory would run out of storage space, hampering further\nlearning. Rather, human memory works better by clearing out clutter,\nsuch as learned information we don\u2019t care about. Forgetting\nallows faster, more reliable recall, and perhaps a greater ratio of\nrecall for what we do care about.\n3.6 Skepticism\n\nMemory fails at times, as we have each experienced. As a result, we\nmight be inclined to inquire into memory\u2019s trustworthiness.\nInquiring may be unnecessary for our having justification. Perhaps\nmemory could provide it as long as there\u2019s no reason to doubt\nits trustworthiness (Moon 2017). Memory is trustworthy, and finding\nthis out is additional evidence in favor of what we believe via\nmemory. But memory still generates or preserves justification prior to\nour inquiry.\n\nOr perhaps if memory is to provide justification for a subject, she\nmust have reason to suppose her memory is trustworthy. It is not\nimmediately obvious what the relevant trustworthiness consists in. It\nmay be a matter of memory functioning in a certain way. And this could\nbe a matter of memory in general being reliable, tending to yield more\ntrue beliefs than false beliefs. A potential reason to suppose memory\nis reliable is that to suggest otherwise is, in a way, self-defeating\n(Locke 1971). To show memory is unreliable, we\u2019d presumably need\nto cite evidence of its failures. But this evidence comes from memory.\nSo if we show memory is unreliable, it is because memory supported\nbelieving something, namely, its own unreliability. So even if it is\nplausible that memory is unreliable, memory supports some\nbelieving.\n\nIt might not matter whether memory in general is reliable.\nPerhaps it just matters whether memory is reliable in the right\ncircumstances or for a certain range of beliefs, or whether a given\nmemory system is reliable, or whether a given memory is likely\ncorrect. An inference to the best explanation argument supports the\nlatter: a given memory, if accurate, can make better sense of why a\nsubject now experiences what that memory predicts she would experience\n(Hasan 2021).\n\nIf memory is to justify certain beliefs it might need to be\ntrustworthy in a different way. It might need to be\nconditionally reliable. Mere reliability is a matter of a\nprocess tending to yield more true beliefs than false beliefs.\nConditional reliability is a process tending to do this when all\nbelief inputs are true. Memory processing could be unreliable, yet\nconditionally reliable. It tends to yield false beliefs, but not when\nthe inputs to it (such as past beliefs) are all true. If, as per one\nsort of preservationism, memory cannot generate justification, it does\nnot seem to matter whether memory is reliable simpliciter. It just\nmatters whether memory is conditionally reliable. Its conditional\nreliability would allow memory to preserve the justification of a past\nbelief, according process reliabilism. Reliability simpliciter does\nnot matter for whether memory preserves justification. Reliability\nsimpliciter does matter for whether memory generates new\njustification, but preservationism (as anti-generativism) denies\nmemory can do this.\n\nInference to the best explanation may also support memory\u2019s\nconditional reliability. That memory is conditionally reliable is part\nof the best explanation of our having doxastic attitudes at all (Frise\n& McCain 2021). Suppose memory functions in a way where it\nsupplies us with doxastic attitudes, such as beliefs. If memory is not\ncreating all these attitudes anew, it is taking some attitudes as\ninputs and later on yielding attitudes as outputs. On the simpler and\nbetter accounts of how memory does this, it minimally changes the\ninput along the way. If there is no or little relevant change, the\nbelief output will have the same truth-value as the input, as it might\neven have the same content. So when all belief inputs to memory are\ntrue, memory tends to yield true beliefs rather than false beliefs. It\nis conditionally reliable.\n\nHowever, even if memory is trustworthy in all ways that matter, the\ntypical person may have an importantly flawed view of how some memory\nsystems work, such that the typical person fails to know via those\nmemory systems (Frise 2022). For instance, our folk understanding of\nepisodic memory fails to appreciate its constructive nature. Leaning\non this folk understanding may imperil knowledge of past events from\nepisodic memory, as it is plausible that a subject cannot know that\np if her justification for believing that p\nessentially depends on a falsehood.\n\nInstead of focusing on memory\u2019s trustworthiness, we might focus\non whether a given belief about the past is correct. Russell (1921)\npoints out that all or nearly all our beliefs about the past could be\nfalse. We might seem to remember various events and facts about what\nhas occurred. But we might have come to exist just five minutes ago.\nThe apparent past is misleading. Russell\u2019s skeptical hypothesis\nis similar to skeptical hypotheses concerning other alleged sources of\nknowledge and justification, such as perception. It is no surprise,\nthen, that many responses to Russell\u2019s skeptical hypothesis\nparallel responses to skepticism of other sorts (see entry on\n skepticism).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": []}, "raw_text": "<div id=\"bibliography\">\n<h2 id=\"Bib\">Bibliography</h2>\n</div>"}, "related_entries": {"entry_list": ["belief", "justification, epistemic: coherentist theories of", "justification, epistemic: foundationalist theories of", "justification, epistemic: internalist vs. externalist conceptions of", "knowledge: analysis of", "knowledge how", "memory", "reliabilist epistemology", "skepticism", "testimony: epistemological problems of"], "entry_link": [{"../belief/": "belief"}, {"../justep-coherence/": "justification, epistemic: coherentist theories of"}, {"../justep-foundational/": "justification, epistemic: foundationalist theories of"}, {"../justep-intext/": "justification, epistemic: internalist vs. externalist conceptions of"}, {"../knowledge-analysis/": "knowledge: analysis of"}, {"../knowledge-how/": "knowledge how"}, {"../memory/": "memory"}, {"../reliabilism/": "reliabilist epistemology"}, {"../skepticism/": "skepticism"}, {"../testimony-episprob/": "testimony: epistemological problems of"}]}, "academic_tools": {"listed_text": ["<img alt=\"sep man icon\" src=\"../../symbols/sepman-icon.jpg\"/>", "<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=memory-episprob\" target=\"other\">How to cite this entry</a>.", "<img alt=\"sep man icon\" src=\"../../symbols/sepman-icon.jpg\"/>", "<a href=\"https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/preview/memory-episprob/\" target=\"other\">Preview the PDF version of this entry</a> at the\n <a href=\"https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/\" target=\"other\">Friends of the SEP Society</a>.", "<img alt=\"inpho icon\" src=\"../../symbols/inpho.png\"/>", "<a href=\"https://www.inphoproject.org/entity?sep=memory-episprob&amp;redirect=True\" target=\"other\">Look up topics and thinkers related to this entry</a>\n at the Internet Philosophy Ontology Project (InPhO).", "<img alt=\"phil papers icon\" src=\"../../symbols/pp.gif\"/>", "<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/sep/memory-episprob/\" target=\"other\">Enhanced bibliography for this entry</a>\nat <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/\" target=\"other\">PhilPapers</a>, with links to its database."], "listed_links": [{"https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=memory-episprob": "How to cite this entry"}, {"https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/preview/memory-episprob/": "Preview the PDF version of this entry"}, {"https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/": "Friends of the SEP Society"}, {"https://www.inphoproject.org/entity?sep=memory-episprob&redirect=True": "Look up topics and thinkers related to this entry"}, {"https://philpapers.org/sep/memory-episprob/": "Enhanced bibliography for this entry"}, {"https://philpapers.org/": "PhilPapers"}]}, "other_internet_resources": {"listed_text": ["Frise, Matthew J., 2015,\n <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/epis-mem/\" target=\"other\">Epistemology of Memory</a>,\n in J.
