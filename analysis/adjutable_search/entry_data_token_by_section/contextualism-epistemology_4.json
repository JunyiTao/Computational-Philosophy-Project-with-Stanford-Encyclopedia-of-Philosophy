    "main_text": "Support for EC: Apparently Inconsistent Knowledge Claims, Skeptical and Everyday || The General Form of the Contextualist Solution\n3.2 The General Form of the Contextualist Solution\nAt first blush, it might seem that there are just three possible responses to SA:\n\nwe can accept the skeptical conclusion;\nwe can reject P2 and the closure principle upon which it trades; or\nwe can reject P1.\n\nEssential to EC is the idea that these three options do not exhaust the possible responses to SA. And, according to proponents of EC, that is a good thing, since they generally hold that skepticism is unacceptable, that the closure principle is extremely plausible, but also that it is hard to see how P1 could be false.[7] But if none of (i)-(iii) make for an attractive response to SA, what is left to deny?\nWe could conclude (iv) that our concept of knowledge is deeply incoherent, and that epistemological paradoxes such as SA are for this reason irresolvable (Schiffer 1996, 2004). But that strikes many as no more satisfactory than embracing skepticism. Like (i), (iv) is a result to be avoided if at all possible.\nFortunately, according to EC, there is another way out: (v) we can deny that SA\u2019s conclusion threatens our intuitive anti-skepticism. According to EC, recall, the proposition expressed by a tokened \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentence depends on context. Thus, if in general a utterance of \u2018S knows that p\u2019 is true just in case the subject has a true belief and is in a strong epistemic position, there are variable standards governing just how strong the subject\u2019s epistemic position must be in order for the tokened sentence to express a truth.\nIn general form, the contextualist\u2019s solution to SA involves claiming that there is something about SA which effects or reflects a change in context. During the course of the reasoning there is a dramatic upwards shift in the standards governing what it takes for a tokening of \u2018S knows that p\u2019 to express a truth. In this way, an utterance of SA\u2019s conclusion expresses a truth only because, owing to the introduction of a high-standards context, what it expresses is that the subject does not stand in an extraordinarily strong epistemic position with regard to the proposition that she has hands. But that, of course, is compatible with her meeting less demanding standards, such as those in play in ordinary contexts. Thus, DeRose says:\n\u2026our ordinary claims to know [are] safeguarded from the apparently powerful attacks of the skeptic, while, at the same time, the persuasiveness of the skeptical arguments is explained. (DeRose 1992, 917)\nOf course, the latter is explained only if we also have an explanation of why we thought that the skeptical argument threatened our ordinary claims to \u201cknow\u201d. The contextualist seeks to explain this by claiming that competent speakers can fail to be aware of the context-sensitivity of sentences involving \u2018know\u2019:\nThis misleads them into thinking that certain knowledge ascriptions conflict, when they are in fact compatible. Contextualism thus combines a contextualist semantics for knowledge ascriptions with a kind of error theory\u2014a claim that competent speakers are systematically misled by the contextualist semantics. (Cohen 1999, 77; see too: Cohen 2014, 72; DeRose 1995, 40\u201341; 1999, 194; 2004b, 37; 2009, 159).\n",
