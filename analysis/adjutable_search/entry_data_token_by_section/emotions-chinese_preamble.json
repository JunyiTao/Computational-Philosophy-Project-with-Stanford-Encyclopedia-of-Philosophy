    "main_text": "\n\nIn many schools of Western philosophy and psychology, emotions are\nunderstood as inner subjective feelings that are sharply contrasted\nwith the intellectual faculties of the mind. In Chinese philosophy,\nhowever, emotions are not fully explained by inner subjective feelings\nor inexplicable passions. Rather, they are understood as interactive,\nresponsive, and holistic affectivity that plays broad psychological,\ncognitive, and moral roles in one\u2019s understanding of the world\n(its objective reality, nature of things, and their situations and\ncircumstances) and one\u2019s dispositions and reactions to external\nstimulation. The present essay discusses the diverse conceptual\ndimensions, psychological orientations and moral significance of\nemotions discussed in major philosophical texts of ancient China from\nthe early sixth to the late first centuries BCE. Specifically, it\nfocuses on how early Chinese philosophers explained the nature of\nemotions and how they identified and categorized emotions. The essay\nconsists of the following sections. First, general philosophical\norientations of Chinese philosophy will be compared and contrasted\nwith Western approaches to emotions. Second, early Chinese notions of\nemotions will be identified through the lens of qing (\u60c5), a\nunique Chinese notion of affectivity (or onto-affectivity) that\nincludes such semantic elements as essence, nature, reality,\ndisposition, desire, and feelings. Third, the philosophical\ninterpretations and the semantic dimensions of qing in early\nChinese philosophy will be discussed. Fourth, terms and lists of\nemotions in early Chinese texts will be analyzed to illustrate how\nChinese philosophers categorized and individuated emotions. Fifth,\nearly Chinese philosophical texts and their theories of emotions will\nbe surveyed to explain how emotions and the broad domains of the\naffective mind (such as innate dispositions, psychological\ninclinations, subjective feelings, and desires) are discussed in\nancient Chinese texts.\n",
