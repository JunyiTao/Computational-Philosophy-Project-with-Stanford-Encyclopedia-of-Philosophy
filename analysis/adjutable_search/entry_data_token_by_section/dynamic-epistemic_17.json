This\n\u201cbefore-after\u201d reading suggests, naturally enough, that\ntime passes as actions occur. The semantics of action models supports\nthis suggestion: determining the truth of an action model formula\n\\([A,e]F\\) in a model\u2014the model \u201cbefore\u201d the\naction\u2014requires us to apply the model-transforming operation\ninduced by the action \\((A,e)\\) and then see whether F holds in\nthe model that results \u201cafter\u201d the action. Channeling\nParikh and Ramanujam (2003) some DEL authors further this suggestion\nby using the temporally charged word \u201chistory\u201d to refer to\na sequence of pointed Kripke models brought about by the occurrence of\na sequence of model-transforming operations. All of this seems to\npoint to the existence of a direct relationship between the occurrence\nof model-transforming actions and the passage of time: time passes as\nthese actions occur. However, the formal languages introduced so far\ndo not have a built-in means for directly expressing the passage of\ntime, and so, as a consequence, the axiomatic theories developed above\nare silent on the relationship between the flow of time and the\noccurrence of model-changing actions. This leaves open the possibility\nthat, within the context of these theories, the passage of time and\nthe occurrence of actions need not necessarily relate as we might\notherwise suspect. \n\nFor more on this, we refer the interested reader to\n Appendix N,\n which mentions a number of studies that bring some method of\ntime-keeping within the scope of the Dynamic Epistemic Logic approach:\nthe work of Sack (2007, 2008, 2010), Yap (2006, 2011), Hoshi (2009),\nHoshi and Yap (2009), van Benthem, Gerbrandy, and Pacuit (2007), van\nBenthem et al. (2009a), D\u00e9gremont, Lo\u0308we, and Witzel\n(2011), and Renne, Sack, and Yap (2009, 2015). \n",
