    "main_text": "Limiting loyalty\n6.1 Whistle blowing\n\nThe issue of loyalty\u2019s limits is usefully illustrated by the\nphenomenon of what is sometimes distinguished as external\n\u201cwhistle blowing.\u201d Although there is some debate about its\nscope, whistle blowing can be helpfully (if not fully) characterized\nas the activity of an employee within an organization\u2014public or\nprivate\u2014who alerts a wider group to setbacks to their interests\nas a result of waste, corruption, fraud, or profit-seeking (Westin,\n1981; Bowman, 1990; Miethe, 1999). Because such employees are\ngenerally considered disloyal, it has been common to characterize them\nas traitors, snitches, weasels, squealers, or rats. \u201cWhistle\nblower\u201d offers a more neutral way of referring to such people,\nand permits an inquiry into the proper limits of employee loyalty.\n\nThe normative background to whistle blowing is a belief that employees\nowe loyalty to their employing organizations. Such loyalty will\ninclude an expectation that employees not jeopardize their\norganization\u2019s interests by revealing certain kinds of\ninformation to people outside it. If employees have grievances, they\nshould be dealt with within the organization (\u201cwe wash our own\nlaundry\u201d). The case for whistle blowing, then, is driven by the\nrecognition, first of all, that internal mechanisms often fail to deal\nadequately with an organization\u2019s failures, and second, that\nbecause the interests jeopardized by those failures often include\nthose outside the organization, a wider group has a prima facie right\nto know of the costs that it faces or that have been imposed on\nit.\n\nBlowing the whistle frequently creates significant disruption within\nan organization\u2014it may lose control of its affairs as it is\nsubjected to external inquiries and constraints; it may find itself\ncrippled by costs or other restrictions; and many within it who are\nlittle more than innocent bystanders may suffer from the repercussions\nof an externally mounted investigation. Because whistle blowing\njeopardizes the organization\u2019s interests (at least as they are\nunderstood within the organization), whistle blowing is therefore seen\nas a significant act of disloyalty. Whistle blowers themselves will\noften argue that owed loyalty has been forfeited (or at least\noverridden), so that no (condemnable) disloyalty has been perpetrated.\nOccasionally they will argue that whistle blowing can be an act of\nloyalty.\n\nA resolution to such conflicting assessments must address the issue of\nloyalty\u2019s limits and, in the case of whistle blowing, it must\ntake cognizance of several considerations: (i) Because of the\ndisruption it threatens, the whistle should be blown only as a matter\nof last resort. (ii) For the same reason the organizational\nwrongdoing should be sufficiently serious. (iii) The public\ncomplaint should be well-grounded\u2014the reasons that\nsupport it should be strong enough to be publicly defensible. (iv) A\npotential whistleblower should consider whether he or she has a\nspecial role-related obligation to take some action. Although\nany member of an organization might have some responsibility for what\nis done in its name, some members will be better placed to make\nappropriate assessments of seriousness and may be more responsible for\nthe way in which the organization conducts its activities. (v) Because\nthe purpose of blowing the whistle is to bring about change, the\npotential for the whistle blowing to be effective ought to be\nconsidered. (vi) It is sometimes argued that the act of whistle\nblowing needs to be appropriately motivated\u2014it must at\nleast be done out of concern for those whose interests are being\njeopardized. This last consideration, however, may have more to do\nwith the whistle blower\u2019s praiseworthiness than with the\njustifiability of blowing the whistle. A morally compromised\nwhistleblower, however, may find his or her credibility undermined and\nthe expos\u00e9 rendered ineffective.\n\nEven if the foregoing considerations are satisfactorily addressed,\nthere remains a question whether blowing the whistle is obligatory or\nmerely permissible. As omissions, failures to blow the whistle must\nengage with debates about the moral obligatoriness of our acting to\nprevent harm. Even if it is morally obligatory, though, there may be\nreasons for not making whistle blowing legally mandatory. In addition,\nthe potential costs to a whistleblower may excuse even legally\nmandated reporting of organizational wrongdoing (Glazer & Glazer,\n1989; Martin, 1992). Although legal protections for whistle blowers\nhave been instituted in some jurisdictions, they have often proved\ninadequate (Glazer & Glazer, 1989).\n\nAnonymous whistle blowing represents a possible solution; it opens the\ndoor, however, to disruptive whistles being blown for the wrong\nreasons or after careless investigation (cf. Elliston, 1982; Coulson,\n1982).\n\nIn sum, the case of whistle blowing illustrates not only the\nimportance of loyalty to many organizations but also the care that\nneeds to be exercised when it is claimed that obligations of loyalty\nare justifiably overridden or forfeited.\n",
