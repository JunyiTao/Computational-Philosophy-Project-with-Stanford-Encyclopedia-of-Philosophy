Philosophical and methodological motivations for combining logics\n\nDavid Hume generated a popular controversy with his famous passages of\n\u201cA Treatise of Human Nature\u201d (see Hume 2000: Book 3, Part\n1, Section 1, paragraph 27) where he noted that sometimes people draw\nconclusions involving prescriptive statements of the form \u2018ought\nto be\u2019 on the basis of descriptive statements of the form\n\u2018what is\u2019. Hume thinks that logic used in this way\ninvolves a dangerous change of subject matter. So, whether or not\n\u2018ought\u2019 can be derived from \u2018is\u2019 has become\none of the central questions of ethical theory, and the majority of\ninterpreters hold that, for Hume, such a derivation is impossible.\n\nWith our point of view concerning combinations of logics, it is\nnecessary to investigate the properties of combining deontic and\nalethic logics: in order to perform such a jump from \u2018is\u2019\nto \u2018ought\u2019 some authors propose (see e.g., Schurz 1997)\nthat what is necessary is an explicit \u201cbridge principle\u201d\nwhich specifically connects \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019.\nAn axiom schema \\(X\\), following Schurz (1991), is a bridge principle\niff \\(X\\) contains at least one schematic letter which has at least\none occurrence within the scope of an \\(\\obcirc\\) (the deontic\n\u201cobligation\u201d operator) and at least one occurrence outside\nthe scope of any \\(\\obcirc\\). Thus, for instance, \n\n\\[p \\rightarrow \\obcirc p\\]\n\n is a\nbridge principle representing \u2018is-ought\u2019 that which would\nappease Hume\u2019s criticism. On the other hand, the much discussed\nmoral principle \u2018ought-implies-can\u2019 (controversially\nattributed to I. Kant, see Baumgardt 1946) can be formalized through\nanother bridge principle: \n\n\\[\\obcirc p \\rightarrow \\lozenge p,\\]\n\n where \\(\\lozenge\\) denotes the\nalethic \u201cpossibility\u201d operator.\n\nClearly, bridge principles do not solve any philosophical questions\nsuch as the \u2018is-ought problem\u2019; nonetheless, they\ncontribute to clarify the problem and to uncover hidden assumptions.\nThe idea of combining logics lend clarification to questions of this\nkind by making clear that, for instance, \u2018is\u2019 and\n\u2018ought\u2019 are indeed independent notions. This is elucidated\nthrough a formal analysis of the composition of the logics involved\n(in this case, alethic and deontic) or by decomposition of the complex\nlogic (in this case, bimodal) into simpler ones. In such\ncircumstances, combining logics can be perceived as a tool for\nsimplifying problems involving heterogeneous reasoning.\n\nThe fact that \u2018ought\u2019 is not conveyed as a predicate, but\nas a modal operator ranging over actions or states of affairs, was\nresponsible for the delay of formal treatments of this centuries-old\nquestion.\n\nSuch a treatment was only possible after the development of general\nmodal logic. Indeed, what we are dealing with here is a bimodal logic,\nwhich is properly treated only after a deeper understanding of the\nsemantical subtleties of mixing alethic and deontic logics. Moreover,\naccording to some philosophers who have argued that it is not possible\nto link \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019 (that is, who defend\nHume\u2019s thesis that no non-trivial \u2018is-ought\u2019\ndeductions are possible), it is mandatory to use combinations of\nfirst-order, alethic and deontic logics (see e.g., Stuhlmann-Laeisz\n1983 and Schurz 1997).\n\nA. Prior (1960), using the apparatus of contemporary modal logic,\ntried to characterize the distinction between normative and\nnon-normative sentences in formal terms, which enabled him to\ndefine senses of \u2018descriptive content\u2019 versus\n\u2018normative content\u2019. A problem, however, occurs with mixed\nsentences, which have both descriptive and normative components, and\nPrior comes up with a paradox: wherever we draw the distinction\nbetween non-normative and normative sentences, unexpected inferences\nfrom non-normative premises to normative conclusions may appear by a\nmere use of laws of classical propositional logic. Consider, for\ninstance, the following two inferences:\n\n (1) \u201cTea-drinking\nis common in England. Therefore:\nEither tea-drinking is common in England or all New Zealanders ought to learn to speak Latin\u201d, \n\n\nformalized as:\n\n (1\u2032) \\(\\texttt{d}\n\\,\\vdash\\, \\texttt{d} \\vee \\obcirc\n\\texttt{s} \\). \n\n\nand\n\n (2) \u201cTea-drinking\nis common in England, or all New\nZealanders ought to learn to speak Latin. Tea-drinking is not common in England.\nTherefore, all New Zealanders ought to learn to speak Latin\u201d, \n\n\nformalized as:\n\n (2\u2032) \n\\(\\texttt{d} \\vee \\obcirc \\texttt{s},\\, \\neg \\texttt{d} \\,\\vdash\\,\n\\obcirc \\texttt{s}\\). \n\n\nIf the mixed sentence \\(\\texttt{d} \\vee \\obcirc \\texttt{s}\\) is\nconsidered to be normative, then (1) is an example of an\n\u2018is-ought\u2019 inference, and if it is considered to be\nnon-normative, then (2) is an example of an \u2018is-ought\u2019\ninference. So, one of them dichotomically represents a violation of\nHume\u2019s thesis in Prior\u2019s terms. Prior concluded from this\nparadox that Hume\u2019s \u2018is-ought thesis\u2019 is simply\nfalse (see Prior 1960: 206): one can simply derive\nconclusions which are ethical starting from premises which have no\nethical character.\n\nPrior recognized however that the inferences involved in the paradox\nare ethically irrelevant or trivial, but neither he nor later authors\ncould find a suitable definition of what it would mean by\n\u201cethical irrelevance\u201d or \u201cethical triviality\u201d\nattached to an inference.\n\nUsing the semantics of modal logics, objections against this\nconclusion can be raised, as for example in Karmo 1988, in the sense\nof separating statements between evaluative in some possible worlds\nand descriptive in others (while keeping their meaning).\n\nBy using concepts of combinations of languages and combinations of\nlogics, G. Schurz (see Schurz 1991; see also Schurz 1997) was able to\nstate a generalized Hume\u2019s thesis (GH); as\nobserved in\n subsection 4.1,\n this treatment is in fact a fusion of two modal logics. In\n(GH) a mixed sentence \\(\\varphi\\) is derived from a set of\npurely descriptive sentences (i.e., sentences free of \\(\\obcirc\\))\nonly if \\(\\varphi\\) is completely \\(\\obcirc\\)-irrelevant (that is,\npredicates in \\(\\varphi\\) within the scope of \\(\\obcirc\\) can be\nreplaced by other predicates salva valididate). Moreover, it\nis proven that (GH) holds in an alethic-deontic first-order\nlogic \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) if, and only if, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) can be\naxiomatized without bridge principles.\n\nThe notion of bridge principle lies in the scope of combination of\nlanguages. In general, many bridge principles can be made explicit\nwithin modal logic, and will be relevant for analyzing relationships\namong diverse modalities. For example, if we take necessity\n\\(\\square\\) and possibility \\(\\lozenge\\) as primitive operators, then\n\n\\[\\lozenge p \\to \\neg\\square\\neg p\\]\n\n is an intuitionistically acceptable bridge principle,\nwhile the converse is not.\n\nBesides Hume\u2019s problem, another example of bimodal logic with\nintrinsic philosophical interest where bridge principles intervene is\nthe logic of physical and alethic modalities. In this logic, the\nlanguage permits the expression of two different notions of necessity:\nthe logical necessity, symbolized by \\(\\square\\), and the physical\nnecessity, symbolized by \\(\\boxdot\\).\n\nThe simplest connection between physical necessity and logical\nnecessity that comprises an acceptable philosophical meaning is given\nby the following bridge axiom: \n\n\\[\\quad\\square p\\to\\boxdot p\\]\n\n meaning that logical\nnecessity is stronger than physical necessity: anything that is\nlogically necessary is physically necessary.\n\nThe resulting logic KT\\(^{\\boxdot}\\) is axiomatized\nby the well-known axioms and rules of KT for both\nmodalities in addition to the bridge axiom above, and is semantically\ncharacterized by Kripke frames with two accessibility relations,\nrequiring that the accessibility relation for physical necessity is\nincluded in the other.\n\nNot only bimodal, but multimodal (also called polymodal) logics, are\nstandard in the literature: a typical case is the logic of knowledge\n(or epistemic logic), usually endowed with modal operators\n\\(K_{1},K_{2},\\ldots,K_{m}\\) representing the knowledge of \\(m\\)\nagents (or \u201cknowers\u201d). The formula \\(K_{i}\\alpha\\) means\n\u201cagent \\(i\\) knows \\(\\alpha\\)\u201d, and the language is able\nto express, for instance, \u201c\\(i\\) knows that \\(j\\) does not know\nthat \\(i\\) knows \\(p\\)\u201d by means of \\(K_{i}\\neg K_{j}K_{i}p\\).\nNo additional mixing principles are mandatory for the combined logic\nof many agents, but bridge axioms may, of course, be added.\n\nThe interest of studying combinations of logics may thus be seen as a\nreflex of the pluralist view of contemporary logical research. Indeed,\nthis kind of bridge axioms can, in principle, connect completely\ndistinct logics. Van Benthem (2006) suggests that combining logics may\nlead to the emergence of new phenomena, depending on the mode of\ncombination, and moreover, it may work as an inspiration (and perhaps\nas a model) for the study of combining epistemic notions. He even\nsuggests that the compartmentalization of logic into subfields as\n\u2018modal\u2019, \u2018temporal\u2019, \u2018epistemic\u2019,\n\u2018doxastic\u2019, \u2018erotetic\u2019 or\n\u2018deontic\u2019 logic has been harmful to Philosophical\nLogic.\n\nCombinations of logics go in the opposite direction of such a\ncompartmentalization: considering that almost any conceptual task to\nbe analyzed involves immediate reasoning concerning necessity,\nobligation, action, time, verbal tense, knowledge, belief, etc.; from\na philosophical point of view, logical combinations may be the right\nway to look at philosophical issues within the theory of causation, of\naction, and so on.\n\nThe idea of looking at logic as an entirety avoiding fragmentation is\nnot new, and philosophers and logicians from Ram\u00f3n Lull to\nGottfried W. Leibniz have thought of building schemes where different\nlogics or logic-like mechanisms could interact and cooperate instead\nof competing. In contemporary terms, the first methods for combining\nlogics were products of logics (introduced by K. Segerberg\n(1973) and independently by V. \u0160ehtman (1978)), fusion\n(introduced by R. Thomason (1984)) and fibring (introduced by\nD. Gabbay (1996a)), all of them dedicated to combining only modal\nlogics. It is worth noting that M. Fitting (1969) gave early examples\nof fusion of modal logics, anticipating the notion of fusion.\n\nOther combination mechanisms followed, such as parameterization and\ntemporalization, which were more on the side of software\nspecification.\n\nMost of these methods have been encompassed in the algebraic\nfibring introduced by A. Sernadas, C. Sernadas and C. Caleiro\n(1999), which notoriously improved the versatility of these techniques\nby means of (universal) categorial constructions, in this way making\nit possible to combine wider classes of logics besides modal\nlogics.\n\nOn the other hand, making heavy use of the language of category\ntheory, J. Goguen and R. Burstall introduced the notion of\ninstitutions as a kind of abstract model theory devoted to\napplications in Computer Science (see Goguen and Burstall 1984, 1992).\nInstitutions are also used as a mechanism for combining logics.\n\nHowever, combining logics does not only mean synthesizing or composing\nlogics, but can also yield interesting examples that go in the\nopposite direction of decomposing logics (see\n section 2).\n A paradigmatic methodology for decomposition is the\npossible-translations semantics, a notion proposed in\nCarnielli 1990 designed to help solve the problem of assigning\nsemantic interpretations to non-classical logics. Examples of\npossible-translations semantics illustrate how a complex logic can be\nanalyzed into less complex factors. Other techniques such as direct union of matrices and plain\nfibring (see Coniglio and Fern\u00e1ndez 2005) can be\nconsidered to be methods for both composing and decomposing.\n\nAll of these methods open the way for a new subject in the realm of\ncombinations of logics: is it possible to decompose a given logic into\nelementary ones? In other words, are there prime logics\nwhich, combined in an appropriate way, may produce all (or part of)\nthe familiar logic systems? This question will be retaken in  \nsection 5\n\nResults on combinations of logics may quickly become too technical\nwhen we turn to the combination of higher-order, modal, relevance\nlogics or non-truth-functional logics, and thus refinements of the\nnotion of algebraic fibring such as modulated fibring (see C.\nSernadas et al. 2002b) or cryptofibring (see Caleiro and\nRamos 2007) may be necessary to solve, for example, some collapsing\nproblems within combinations of logics (see\n section 5).\n This naturally leads to the use of category theory as a universal\nlanguage and as a tool to deal with such problems. But the fact is\nthat combinations of logics do not necessarily depend upon any highly\ntechnical methodology, and even some relatively simple examples can be\nreally expressive. There is a recognized intersection and interaction\nbetween Philosophy and theoretical Computer Science, and techniques\nfor combining logics are also revealed to be very apt tools for\nhandling and thus better understanding Kripke models. Having been\nintroduced in the domain of Philosophical Logic, Kripke models are\nessential in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence as semantic\nstructures for logics of belief, knowledge, temporal logics, logics\nfor actions, etc. Knowledge representation and reasoning may require\ncombining several reasoning formalisms, including combinations of\ntemporal reasoning, reasoning in description logic, reasoning about\nspace and distance, and so on. Logics, combining temporal and modal\ndimensions, are also becoming a relevant tool in agent-oriented\nprogramming languages. Other applications of combinations of logics\ninclude software specification, knowledge representation,\narchitectures for intelligent computing and quantum computing,\nsecurity protocols and authentication, secure computation and\nzero-knowledge proof systems, besides their connections to formal\nethics and game semantics.\n\nThe Belief-Desire-Intention model of agents (BDI) is concerned with\nthe formal representation of practical reasoning involving action,\nintention, belief, will, deliberation, goal-driven modeling, etc. This\nkind of reasoning is essential for planning (especially for artificial\nagents). It is then just natural to think about combining simple modal\nlogics for knowledge, belief, obligation, capability, opportunity,\netc., so as to define more robust BDI logics. Governatori et al. 2002\ninvestigates the relationships between BDI logics and a particular\ncase of Gabbay\u2019s fibring semantics (see\n subsection 4.2)\n called dovetailing, showing that a (general) logical account\nof BDI can be handled by means of dovetailing multimodal logics.\n\nBut combinations of logics also work from another perspective: instead\nof directly combining logic systems and looking for the interpretation\nof the resulting system, one can start from a purely mathematical\nperspective. In van Benthem et al. 2006, for instance, the authors\nintroduce the notion of horizontal and vertical topologies on the\nproduct of topological spaces, and show that the modal logic of\nproducts of topological spaces with horizontal and vertical topologies\ncoincides with the fusion of S4 with itself. The resulting\ncompleteness proof has deep connections with some topological\nproperties of the real and of the rational numbers.\n",
