    "main_text": "Objections || Incompleteness\n7.4 Incompleteness\n\nOne of the most important objections pressed against the idea of\npublic reason concerns its capacity to provide solutions to all, or\nalmost all, of the important moral and political questions we face,\nthat is, the question of whether public reason is complete\n(Rawls 1996, 244\u2013246; Rawls 1999b, 585\u2013586). A number of\ncritics argue that public reason lacks the resources to offer\nsolutions to many important moral or political questions because the\nanswers to these questions depend on appeal to controversial moral,\nreligious, or metaphysical claims of the sort over which reasonable\npeople disagree and that are excluded from many conceptions of public\nreason, particularly those conceptions that adopt a consensus approach\nto the structure of public reason (Horton 2003: Kramer 2017, 92\u2013155;\nde Marneffe 1994; Reidy 2000: Sandel 1998).\n\nThere are two ways in which public reason might be incomplete (Gaus\n1996, 151\u2013158: Schwartzman 2004). First, public reason might be\nindeterminate, that is, it may be unable to deliver any clear\nconclusions about a particular question. In these cases, it is\nsometimes said that public reason \u201cruns out\u201d: its content\nsimply proves insufficient to yield an answer to the question posed.\nSecond, public reason might be inconclusive with regard to\nsome question, that is, a plurality of different answers might be\napparently justified by appeal to public reason, and public reason\nalone cannot clearly tell us which answer is correct or the most\nreasonable alternative.\n\nIndeterminacy is the more serious charge, but critics maintain that\neven if public reason was only inconclusive with regard to many\nquestions, this would also be a serious, perhaps fatal, objection to\npublic reason. Some of the topics with regard to which critics allege\npublic reason is either inconclusive or indeterminate include:\nabortion, stem-cell research, gay marriage, prostitution, justice for\nfuture generations, the treatment of animals, and other issues where\ncritics allege getting the right moral or political answer depends\nupon religious or metaphysical claims about personhood, or else on\ncontroversial claims about human flourishing or the good life. Some\ncritics believe that virtually all moral or political questions\ndepend, to a certain extent, on truths about personhood, metaphysics,\nor human flourishing, and so these critics are likely to see the\ncharge of incompleteness as a deep and pervasive problem for public\nreason.\n\nWhat responses are available to the proponent of public reason? With\nregard to the charge of inconclusiveness, most advocates of public\nreason are inclined to accept the charge, but deny that it represents\nan objection (Freeman 2007, 242\u2013243; Gaus 2011, 303\u2013333;\nQuong 2011, 204\u2013212, 285\u2013287; Rawls 1996, 240\u2013241;\nSchwartzman 2004; A. Williams 2000). If, for a given moral or\npolitical question, public reason seems to yield a number of equally\nreasonable answers, we should find an appropriate way to choose\nbetween these competing answers. If we do so, the idea of public\nreason is upheld, rather than undermined. On this view, the critics\nwrongly suppose that the point of public reason is to deliver a unique\nanswer to each question we face; the point is rather to ensure that\nthe rules or principles that we adopt can be reasonably justified to\nall. Showing that some rule we currently apply is not the only rule\nthat can meet the test of public reason is no objection, provided the\nmechanism by which different public justifiable rules are selected can\nitself be reasonably justified. The charge of indeterminacy seems more\nserious: if public reason can provide no answer to a given moral or\npolitical question, we are apparently left with no alternative but to\nrely on nonpublic forms of reasoning. In response to this objection,\nthere are two main strategies. One is to insist that public reason is\nunlikely to be indeterminate in many cases, or at least to rebut\nspecific attempts by critics to show that public reason is\nindeterminate with regard to a particular question (Bell 2002; Freeman\n2007, 241\u2013251; Schwartzman 2004, 205\u2013208; A. Williams\n2000, 205\u2013208). The second strategy is to insist that, even if\npublic reason is indeterminate with regard to a given question, this\ndoes not suffice to establish that it is permissible to resort to\nnonpublic forms of reasoning. Alternative solutions\u2014deferring\ndecisions if possible, finding forms of mutual accommodation, or\nrandom decision-making procedures\u2014may be preferable to resorting\nto nonpublic reasoning (Schwartzman 2004, 209\u2013214; A. Williams\n2000, 209\u2013211).\n",
