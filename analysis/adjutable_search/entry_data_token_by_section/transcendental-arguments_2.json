Objections to Transcendental Arguments\n\nJust as the rise in interest in transcendental arguments within\ntwentieth-century philosophy can largely be traced back to the work of\nStrawson, so too the subsequent disillusionment can largely be traced\nback to the work of one person, namely Barry Stroud, in his\ninfluential 1968 article (Stroud 1968). In that paper, Stroud focused\non the nature of the transcendental claim that the truth of some\nproposition S is a necessary condition for the possibility of\nlanguage, but then argued that \u2018the sceptic can always very\nplausibly insist that it is enough to make language possible if we\nbelieve that S is true, or that it looks for all the\nworld as if it is, but that S needn\u2019t actually be\ntrue\u2019 (Stroud 1968 [2000b: 24]). Moreover, the general problem\nthis raises is that if such a response by the sceptic is plausible in\nthe case of language, perhaps it is also plausible in the case of\nother starting-points too? Thus, for example, when it comes to\nscepticism about the existence of the external world or other minds,\nmaybe no argument can be constructed to show there must actually\nbe such a world or minds as a condition for inner experience\nor the having of thoughts, but just that we must believe them to\nexist, or that they must seem to us to do so\u2014which hardly looks\nlike enough to quash sceptical doubts on these matters.\n\nNow, in the 1968 paper, Stroud appears to get to his conclusion by\narguing from an analysis of specific cases (viz. arguments proposed by\nStrawson and Shoemaker in Strawson 1959 and Shoemaker 1963\nrespectively). But then, this may seem to leave open the hope that\neven if these arguments fall to his critique, others may not. However,\nin subsequent work, Stroud has said more to substantiate his objection\nand make it seem more likely to hold across the board. For, while he\nallows that we might reasonably be able to make modal claims about\n\u2018how our thinking in certain ways necessarily requires that we\nalso think in certain other ways\u2019, he believes it is puzzling\n\u2018how\u2026truths about the world which appear to say or imply\nnothing about human thought or experience\u2019 (for example, that\nthings exist outside us in space and time, or that there are other\nminds) \u2018[can] be shown to be genuinely necessary conditions of\nsuch psychological facts as that we think and experience things in\ncertain ways, from which the proofs begin\u2019. Stroud goes on:\n\u2018It would seem that we must find, and cross, a bridge of\nnecessity from the one to the other. That would be a truly remarkable\nfeat, and some convincing explanation would surely be needed of how\nthe whole thing is possible\u2019 (Stroud 1994 [2000b: 158\u20139;\ncf. also 212]). Thus, Stroud is prepared to allow \u2018that we can\ncome to see how our thinking in certain ways necessarily requires that\nwe also think in certain other ways, and so perhaps in certain other\nways as well, and we can appreciate how rich and complicated the\nrelations between those ways of thinking must be\u2019 (Stroud 1994\n[2000b: 158\u20139]); but he believes that anything more than this,\nwhich asserts that \u2018non-psychological facts\u2019 about the\nworld outside us constitute necessary conditions for our thinking, is\nproblematic.\n\nThen, having apparently established that the strongest defensible\ntranscendental claims concern merely how things must appear to us or\nwhat we must believe, the second stage of Stroud\u2019s argument is\nthat in order to bridge the gap that this has opened up, and to get to\na conclusion about how things actually are, one must opt\neither for verificationism or idealism. The former holds that in order\nto be meaningful, a sentence must say something that we can determine\nto be true or false. If so, then we cannot be left in the limbo of\nsceptical doubt behind a veil of appearances wondering where the truth\nlies. The latter sees no gap between how the world is and how we think\nthings are or merely appear to us. However, aside from the potentially\nproblematic nature of both these positions, an appeal to either\nverificationism or idealism is also dialectically unsatisfactory, as\nany such appeal would appear to render the transcendental argument\nitself redundant\u2014for each on its own is powerful enough to\ndisarm sceptical worries, without the transcendental manoeuvre now\nbeing required (cf. Stroud 1968 [2000b: 24\u20135]). In this way,\nStroud has convinced many that the proponent of transcendental\narguments faces an unattractive dilemma: either to dispense with\nverificationism or idealism, but fall short of the anti-sceptical\nconclusion concerning how things are; or to accept verificationism or\nidealism, but then make the transcendental argument itself\nsuperfluous.\n\nThe problem that Stroud has highlighted may be briefly illustrated by\nreturning to the exemplars of transcendental arguments that we\nconsidered in\n Section 1.\n Thus, when it comes to Kant\u2019s Refutation of Idealism, it can be\nsaid that the most that Kant really establishes is that we have\nexperience as of things outside us in space, while all that\nStrawson\u2019s objectivity argument shows is that we must\napply the is/seems distinction to our experience, and so\nbelieve that things exist without us experiencing them, but that this\ndoesn\u2019t do enough to show that this distinction is really a\nvalid one (cf. Wilkerson 1976: 57, Brueckner 1989). Likewise, against\nPutnam it is argued that the sceptic can challenge his externalist\ntheory of reference, where on a more internalist view, you could then\nthink about being in a vat even if you were in one, as the meaning of\n\u2018vat\u2019 no longer depends on your relations to the world;\nor, if Putnam insists on his externalism, it could be claimed that\nthis is already a position that rules out scepticism because\nit assumes that the mind and world are linked in important ways,\nmaking it unnecessary to make appeal to the specific transcendental\nargument that Putnam rests upon it (cf. McCulloch 1999). Similarly,\nagainst Davidson it can be argued that thought would be possible, even\nif the \u2018others\u2019 with which one \u2018triangulated\u2019\nwere nothing but robots or automata; or again, if this is ruled out by\nappeal to some form of semantic externalism, this then renders the\ntranscendental argument redundant. In all these cases, therefore, it\nmay appear that Stroudian objections can be used to damaging\neffect.\n\nThus, applying Stroud\u2019s concerns to a range of arguments in this\nway may seem to support the view that the transcendental arguments so\nfar produced succumb to his dilemma (although, of course, attempts to\nbolster the arguments can also be made). Nonetheless, it might be felt\nthat unless Stroud can substantiate his more principled objection to\nthe very possibility of crossing the \u2018bridge of necessity\u2019\nthat is required by any sort of world-directed transcendental claim,\nhe has still not yet established conclusively that no transcendental\nargument can be made to work, and must always either fall short or end\nup being superfluous. So the question arises: how powerful is his\nsuggestion that a \u2018truly remarkable feat\u2019 is required\nhere, one that we have good reason to think cannot feasibly be\naccomplished?\n\nPerhaps one difficulty that can be raised for Stroud, is that while he\nthinks there is something inherently problematic in making a claim\nabout how the world must be as a condition for our thought or\nexperience, he does not think that there is anything particularly\nproblematic about claiming that our thought or experience is a\nnecessary condition for some other aspect of our thought or\nexperience\u2014indeed, he exploits such claims himself in his own\narguments against the sceptic (cf. Stroud 1994 [2000b:\n165\u201376]). But how can claims of necessary connections between\nsome thoughts or experience and some others be defended more cogently\nthan claims of necessary connections between some thoughts or\nexperience and the world? Why are such \u2018bridges\u2019 or modal\nconnections easier to make \u2018within thought\u2019 than between\nhow we think and how the world must be to make that thought possible?\nNow, one might take this symmetry between the two to be reason to be\nsuspicious of claims of necessary connections both between some\nthoughts and the world and between some thoughts and other thoughts\nabout the world: but as we have seen, Stroud himself seems to think\nthey are viable between \u2018psychological facts\u2019 (cf. Stroud\n2000a [2000b: 224\u201344]). If so, it could be argued, he needs to\ngive us some account of why they are less problematic here than\nbetween our thought and the world; but in fact he just seems to take\nit to be obvious, and so provides no such account (cf. Cassam 1987:\n356\u20137; Glock 2003: 38\u20139).\n\nHowever, even if Stroud\u2019s position is indeed weaker than it may\nat first appear, this does not mean that transcendental arguments are\nin the clear when it comes to the world-directed transcendental claims\nthey embody. For, a different worry to the same effect can also be\nurged against them, which in this case relates to the dialectics of\nour engagements with scepticism (cf. Stern 2007). The central thought\nis this: On the one hand, the sceptic is often conceived as grounding\nher doubts on the fallibility of our ordinary belief-forming\nprocesses, such as perception and memory. On the other hand, the\nproponent of a transcendental argument hopes to answer her doubts by\nadvancing the claim that X is a necessary condition for the\npossibility of Y and so deduce the former from the latter.\nBut the dialectical concern this raises is this: why, if the sceptic\nis dubious about cognitive methods like perception and memory, should\nshe be any more sanguine about the methods we have used (whatever\nthese are) to arrive at the modal claims embodied in the\ntranscendental argument?\n\nNow, one line of response might be to say that the doubts the sceptic\nraises over our modal knowledge here can themselves be blocked or\nshown to be spurious, for example, by providing evidence for the\nreliability of our methods in the modal case, or questioning the right\nof the sceptic to use the mere possibility of error against such\nknowledge. But then, it seems likely that similar claims could\nalso be used to bolster the credentials of our\nnon-transcendental bases for knowledge, such as perception\nand memory, in a way that would then render the transcendental\nargument redundant.\n\nThus, even if Stroud\u2019s own critique of transcendental arguments\nis found wanting, it seems that another along these lines can be put\nin its place, leading to a similar dilemma: either transcendental\narguments are offered to try to establish what the sceptic questions,\nbut are then vulnerable to sceptical doubts concerning the truth of\nthe modal claims they employ; or they can successfully respond to\nthose doubts, but in ways that then seem likely to render our\nnon-transcendental grounds for knowledge legitimate too, so that our\nconviction concerning such knowledge no longer seems to need to make\nany appeal to a transcendental argument.\n\nOne further thought is that perhaps the main problem is a consequence\nof mistakenly supposing that transcendental arguments should be\ndeductively valid. Note that Kant himself used the corresponding\nGerman phrase of \u2018deduction\u2019 in a different sense (see the\nentry on Kant\u2019s Transcendental Arguments). One possibility is\nthat such arguments should be taken as abductive ones,\ninvolving inference to the best explanation (Hoffmann 2019, Allen\n2021, Reynolds 2022): the idea is that although one cannot deductively\ninfer X from the possibility of Y, one can claim\nthat X is the best explanation of Y\u2019s being\npossible. In making such an inference, one needs to list various\ncandidate explanations and give good reason to think that the\none being favored is indeed the best explanation. If this path is\ntaken, it might engender worries about the distinctness and power of\ntranscendental arguments. In the next section we will see more\nresponses to the above objections.\n",
