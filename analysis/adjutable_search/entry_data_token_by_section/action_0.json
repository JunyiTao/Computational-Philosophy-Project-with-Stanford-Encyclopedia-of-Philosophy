    "main_text": "About the Question: What is an Action?\n1. About the Question: What is an Action?\n\nThe central question in philosophy of action is standardly taken to\nbe: \u201cWhat makes something an action?\u201d However, we obtain\ndifferent versions of the question depending on what we take as the\ncontrast class from which actions are to be differentiated. The\ndifferent questions in turn encode important presuppositions. First,\nwe may understand the question as asking us to differentiate between\nintentional action and the notions of acting and activity considered\nabove (cf. Hyman 2015). Most commonly, however, the question is taken\nin terms of Wittgenstein\u2019s classic formulation: \u201cWhat is\nleft over if I subtract the fact that my arm goes up from the fact\nthat I raise my arm?\u201d (1953 [2010], \u00a7621). A common, though\ncontested, reading of this passage is this: there are certain events\nof an arm\u2019s going up that are actions, and some that are not\n(e.g. if someone tickles me in my sleep). What further factor does the\naction have that the event resulting from tickling lacks?\n\nMany historical as well as contemporary thinkers hope to answer just\nthis question. A simple answer, common in the early modern period\n(e.g. Descartes 1641 AT VII 57; Hobbes 1651/1668, i.6; Hume 1739\u20131740\nT II.3.iii; SB 413\u201318), is that what distinguishes actions from other\nevents is that they are the causal outcomes of desires, volitions, or\nacts of will. A modern version of this view, considered below, appeals\ninstead to intentions, regarded as distinctive mental states. Despite\nthe intuitiveness of these \u201cstandard\u201d answers, there have\nbeen increasing worries that they are based on disputable assumptions.\nFirst, there is an assumption about the metaphysical category to which\nactions belong. Although it is natural to take them as events, some\nphilosophers have argued that there are good reasons to group them\nunder a different category. Second, the common reading of\nWittgenstein\u2019s question presupposes what has been called\n\u201cadditive\u201d or \u201cdecompositional\u201d conceptions of\naction (Ford 2011; Lavin 2015, 2013; cf. Boyle 2016): it is assumed\nthat an account of action can be given in terms of distinct, and\nsimpler components. However, a number of authors have argued that this\nreductive project is bound to fail (Anscombe 1995; Vogler 2001;\nO\u2019Brien 2012; Levy 2013; Horst 2015; Valaris 2015; Della Rocca\n2020, ch.4).\n\nIt has also been contended that philosophers who offer the standard\nanswers make important methodological assumptions. These philosophers\napproach questions about agency as though they were on par with\nscientific questions to this extent: they seek mechanistic, or causal\nexplanations of agency, explanations that can be grasped from an\nobjective perspective. However, drawing inspiration from Kant, some\nphilosophers contend that philosophy of action should be done from the\nagential perspective (Nagel 1989; Korsgaard 2009; Bilgrami 2012;\nSchapiro 2021); and other philosophers drawing from Aristotle and\nFrege have argued for similar views (Thompson 2008; Lavin 2013; Ford\n2017). From a different standpoint, the standard methodology has been\ncriticized as not being scientific enough. It has been argued that\ncertain empirical results disprove some of the basic assumptions\nbehind these answers. For example, Libet\u2019s experiments have been\ntaken to suggest that intentions are causally ineffective, and that to\nunderstand the true causes of action we would have to focus on neural\nprocesses (\u2018action potentials\u2019) about which we could only\nlearn through standard scientific methods (Libet 1985; Libet et al.\n1993). Although these radical views are now widely held to be based on\nfaulty conceptual and empirical grounds (e.g. Mele. 2010; Levy 2005;\nBrass, Furstenberg, and Mele 2019), surprising scientific results\ncontinue to challenge commonly held views in philosophy of action (see\ne.g. Wegner 2002 and Nahmias 2014 for critical discussion of recent\nfindings).\n\nIn this entry we draw from the work of philosophers working through\ndifferent methodological paradigms. We will not bring up these\ndifferences again, but they may be worth keeping in mind as we\nconsider the various debates below.\n",
