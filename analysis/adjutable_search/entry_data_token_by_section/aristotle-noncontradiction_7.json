    "main_text": "The Argument from Conflicting Appearances\n8. The Argument from Conflicting Appearances\n\nIn chapter 5, Aristotle distinguishes two types of opponent, those who\nclaim to reject PNC for the sake of argument, and those Pre-Socratics\nwho are genuinely perplexed. He now addresses the second type.\nAnaxagoras and Democritus are led to say that contradictions are true\nat the same time, because they are confused by change. They see\ncontraries coming into existence out of the same thing, and infer that\nthe same thing must have had contrary properties. Aristotle introduces\nhis distinction between the potential and the actual to dispel their\nconfusion. An object can be potentially F and potentially not\nF, but it cannot be actually F and actually not\nF at the same time.\n\nOther philosophers are led by the argument from conflicting\nappearances to accept conclusions that violate PNC or lead to general\nscepticism. Aristotle presents the argument as follows:\n\nThere are three sorts of cases of conflicting appearances:\n\n\nThings appear different to different members of the same species,\ne.g., the same thing is thought bitter by some and sweet by others\n(Metaph IV 5 1009b2\u20133).\nThings appear different to members of different species (e.g., to\nother animals and to us) (Metaph IV 5 1009b7\u20138).\nThings do not always appear the same even to the senses of the\nsame individual (Metaph IV 5 1009b8\u20139).\n \nIt is not clear which appearances are true and which false\n(Metaph IV 5 1009b10).\nConclusions:\n\n\nNothing is true (Democritus in dogmatic mood, Metaph IV 5\n1009b11\u201312).\n(If something is true) it is not clear to us (Democritus in\nskeptical mood, Metaph IV 5 1009b12).\nEverything is just as true as everything else. (This is mentioned\nas an explanation of premiss 2 at Metaph IV 5\n1009b10\u201311. It is Protagoras\u2019s view, as described at the\nbeginning of the chapter.)\n \n\n\nIn response to this argument, Aristotle concedes most of the first\npremise. He agrees that things do appear different to different\nmembers of different species, to different members of the same\nspecies, and even to the same individual, although he denies that the\nsame thing can appear differently to the same sense of the same\nindividual at the same time (Metaph IV 5 1010b18).\n\nUnlike modern philosophers, Aristotle does not attack the inference\nfrom premises 1 and 2 to the conclusions in 3. Instead, he attacks\npremise 2. If the attack is successful, he will have knocked down all\nthree conclusions at the same time. Aristotle\u2019s attack on\npremise 2 does not rest on accepting a majority verdict. Aristotle\nappears to accept his opponents\u2019 argument that, in cases like\n1a, where things appear different to different members of the same\nspecies, majority decision is not an appropriate criterion for truth,\nbecause if the majority were ill or mad, the minority would be thought\nto be in that condition. He argues instead that people are not really\nconfused as to whether magnitudes and colors are such as appear to\nthose at a distance or those nearby, or whether what appears to the\nweak or strong is heavier or whether what appears to one asleep or\nawake is true. Once awake, a person in Libya is not confused about\nwhether his dreams of Athens or his waking experiences are true; he\ndoes not start out for the odeon. Therefore, according to Aristotle,\npeople do not really find it unclear which appearances to take as\ntrue.\n\nAristotle extends his discussion to opinions, arguing that not all\nopinions are equally authoritative. Aristotle points out that when it\ncomes to questions about our future health, the opinion of the\nphysician is not on a par with a lay person. Nor are our senses\nequally authoritative on the same subject matter. Each sense is\nauthoritative about its own special objects. For example, sight, and\nnot taste, is the authority on color, but taste, and not sight, is the\nauthority on flavor (Metaph IV 5 1010b11\u201317). According\nto Aristotle, then, it is far from unclear which appearances, or whose\nopinions, are to be trusted in cases of conflict. Those who profess to\ndeny this, show, by their own actions, presumably by trusting only\ntheir waking appearances when they are awake, and by consulting a\nphysician when they are ill and so on, that they believe quite the\nreverse. Therefore, according to Aristotle, the second premise of the\nargument from conflicting appearances is false, and so the argument\nfails.\n\nAristotle has not had the last word. The skeptics of Hellenistic times\nmade much of arguments from conflicting appearances, and modern\nphilosophers continue to discuss their efficacy, especially in the\nfield of ethics.\n9. Protagoras, Heraclitus, and Plato\u2019s Theaetetus\n\nAt the beginning of Metaphysics IV 5, Aristotle says that PNC\nstands and falls with the doctrine of Protagoras, that each individual\nhuman being is the measure of all things. In his Theaetetus\n151\u2013183, Plato argues that Theaetetus, who holds that knowledge\nis nothing but perception, is committed to Protagoras\u2019s view via\nan argument from conflicting appearances. If the wind appears cold to\nyou but hot to me and knowledge is nothing but perception, then we\nmust both be correct, as Protagoras says.\n\nPlato goes on to argue that Protagoras is committed to the view that\nnothing is anything in itself (otherwise one might be wrong about how\nit really is) and to a \u201csecret\u201d Heraclitean doctrine of\nflux. In order to accommodate more and more conflicting appearances,\nand to avoid violating PNC, more and more flux is needed, until we\nreach a radical version of Heraclitus\u2019s doctrine according to\nwhich everything is \u201cso and not so\u201d (Tht 183),\nwith accompanying difficulties for ordinary language. The extended\nargument also contains a mini-argument, a\n\u201cself-refutation\u201d, where Plato draws the\n\u201cexquisite\u201d conclusion that Protagoras refutes himself if\nhe agrees that other people disagree with his own view (Tht\n171A-D). If they are right, then he must be wrong!\n\nThe details of Plato\u2019s argument, the fairness and the success of\nhis strategy against Theaetetus and Protagoras are matters of some\ncontroversy. A recent point of contention is whether Plato\u2019s\nProtagoras is committed to a view of \u201crelative truth\u201d\ninstead of flux, and how far Aristotle\u2019s Protagoras is similar.\nWhat is less controversial is that elements of Plato\u2019s\ndiscussion re-surface in Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics IV.\nAristotle\u2019s opponents are said to believe that knowledge is\nperception because they think that what they perceive is all that\nexists, and they are also said to be impressed by arguments from\nconflicting appearances. The thesis that knowledge is perception and\nan argument from conflicting appearances lead to Protagoras\u2019s\nview in Plato\u2019s Theaetetus. In Metaphysics IV\n5, Aristotle agrees with Plato that Protagoras\u2019s view and the\nsuggestion that everything is \u201cso and not so\u201d (an\nexpression echoed by Aristotle earlier at Metaph IV 4\n1006a30\u201331) go hand in hand. The Protagoras of Plato\u2019s\nTheaetetus and the PNC-opponent in Metaphysics IV 4\nare said to be committed to the thesis that nothing is anything in\nitself, understood by Aristotle to mean that everything is\naccidental.\n\nWhile Aristotle does not saddle Heraclitus himself with the rejection\nof PNC, he notes that Heraclitus\u2019s followers thought that there\nis so much change in the world that it is impossible to say anything\ntrue, and so Cratylus, one of their number, was reduced to wagging his\nfinger. Cratylus was mistaken, according to Aristotle, because there\nis no radical flux. When things change, something persists, and even\nif the quantity of a thing is not constant, we know each thing by what\nsort of thing it is. Presumably, even if its water is constantly\nflowing, we can still identify a river. Aristotle points out that if\nthere were radical flux, this would be tantamount to everything being\nat rest, so the idea of radical flux is contradictory.\n\nOne way to think of Aristotle\u2019s strategy in Metaphysics\nIV is as the reverse of Plato\u2019s. If the PNC-opponent says\nsomething significant, for example, the beginning of\nProtagoras\u2019s doctrine of the measure, \u201chuman being\u201d,\nthen she is committed to denying the thesis that nothing is anything\nin itself, and to accepting a non-Protagorean view. On this\ninterpretation of Aristotle\u2019s strategy, at least two puzzling\nfeatures in Aristotle\u2019s discussion are resolved, why he appears\nto be addressing someone who claims the contrary, and not the\ncontradictory of PNC, and how Aristotle can argue from the second\nversion of the principle of non-contradiction to the first. Since\nPlato\u2019s Protagorean is forced to reject PNC across the board,\nAristotle\u2019s Protagorean PNC-skeptic would be an opponent who\nclaims the contrary, not merely the contradictory, of PNC. In\naddition, a Protagorean PNC-skeptic, who accepts that \u201cas things\nappear to one, so they are\u201d would have to be impressed by an\nargument that shows that things cannot appear to him in a way that\nwould violate PNC. On his own view, showing that PNC is indubitable\nwould also show that it is true.\n\nAt this point, one might wonder if Protagoras can turn the tables on\nAristotle. Certainly, to a Protagorean, showing that PNC is\nindubitable would show that it is true, but it also assumes his own\nview, that how things appear is how they are! Does Aristotle or\nProtagoras win? The same can be asked of the \u201cexquisite\u201d\nargument of Plato\u2019s Theaetetus. Is Protagoras\u2019s\nview refuted or confirmed? The Stoic Chrysippus apparently wrote a\nwhole book, now lost, on such table-turning arguments.\n\nA further question surrounds the formulation of Protagoras\u2019s own\nview. In Metaphysics IV 6, Aristotle explains how a\nProtagorean PNC-skeptic ought to present his view so as to avoid\nviolating PNC: \u201cthose who seek to be compelled by argument, and\nat the same time demand to be called to account for their views, must\nguard themselves by saying that the truth is not that what appears\nexists, but that what appears exists for him to whom it appears, and\nwhen, and to the senses to which, and under the conditions under which\nit appears.\u201d Otherwise, they will find themselves contradicting\nthemselves (Metaph IV 6 1011a20\u201325). However, Aristotle\nstill finds fault with this view because it makes everything relative\nto perception, including the perceiver. Not everything can be relative\nto perception, according to Aristotle. As he explains at the end of\nthe previous chapter, there is something beyond perception that causes\nthe perception and is prior. Aristotle uses his discussion of PNC and\nProtagoras to stake out a realist position.\n10. Aristotle\u2019s Conclusion and Implications for Ethics and Politics\n\nAt the end of chapter 6, Aristotle concludes, \u201cLet this, then\nsuffice to show (1) that the firmest belief is that opposite\nassertions are not true at the same time, (2) what happens to those\nwho speak in this way and (3) why people do speak in this way\u201d\n(Metaph IV 6 1011b13\u201315).\n\nOn the first point, as we saw, it is controversial whether\nAristotle\u2019s conclusion that the firmest belief is a belief in\nPNC carries with it the presupposition that PNC is true, a\npresupposition that is needed for his own project of first philosophy.\nOn the third point, Aristotle discusses views about perception and\nchange that lead people to say that they reject PNC. On the second\npoint, Aristotle shows that those who say that they reject\nPNC do not really do so, or, if they do, they will be giving up\nintelligible discourse and action. It is controversial how much of an\nessentialist or indeed realist view one must accept if one accepts\nPNC, but it is clear that PNC is essential for the project of an\nAristotelian science.\n\nWithout PNC, Aristotle notes, beginners in philosophy who are\ninterested in the truth would be off on a wild goose chase\n(Metaph IV 5 1009b36\u20138). This applies to both\nmetaphysics and science, and to ethics and politics. Without PNC, and\nwithout the truth, we would be living in a world of mere sophistry\nand, although Aristotle fails to spell this out, power.\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of PNC, then, has broader ethical and\npolitical implications.\n11. Dialetheism, Paraconsistency, and Aristotle\n\nAristotle\u2019s account of the PNC has been challenged anew by\nmodern-day dialetheists, who hold that there are some true\ncontradictions, and that Aristotle\u2019s discussion fails to show\notherwise. One approach is to argue that some of Aristotle\u2019s\ndiscussion of PNC begs the question in favor of PNC. (Of course,\nAristotle would agree that any argument in favor of PNC must beg the\nquestion.) Another approach is for dialetheists to refuse to let the\nAristotelian reformulate their supposed counterexamples to PNC by\nadding qualifications so that these supposed counterexamples do not\nviolate PNC after all. The Aristotelian can counter that without those\nqualifications the dialetheist has not said anything meaningful at\nall. Finally, the dialetheist may ask how Aristotle would deal with\nthe liar\u2019s paradoxical sentence \u201cI am lying\u201d. Why is\nthis not both true and false at the same time as the dialetheist\ncontends?\n\nBesides dialetheists, some modern logicians, who need not be\ndialetheists, think that logic can be paraconsistent, i.e., that,\ncontrary to classical logic, one contradiction need not lead to an\nexplosion where anything goes. While Aristotle is obviously not a\ndialetheist, it is not clear where he stands on the issue of\nparaconsistency in Metaph IV. Although Aristotle does claim\nthat if his opponent rejects PNC across the board, she is committed to\na world in which anything goes, he never argues that if (per\nimpossibile) his opponent is committed to one contradiction, she\nis committed to anything, and he even considers that the\nopponent\u2019s view might apply to some statements but not to others\n(Metaph IV 4 1008a10\u201312). However one understands these\npassages, in the Prior Analytics, Aristotle does commit\nhimself to the view that syllogistic is paraconsistent (APr.\nII 15 64a15).\n12. Posterior Analytics I 11\n\nThis is an intriguing and relatively neglected text. At first sight it\nlooks as if Aristotle is presenting a valid argument that includes\ncontradictions as some of the premises, which would be surprising\ngiven his account of PNC in Metaphysics IV. However, the text\nis even more obscure than usual.\n\nThere are two basic interpretations. According to one interpretation,\nAristotle does indeed include contradictions, but these are idle and\nplay no real logical role in the argument he presents. According to\nthe other interpretation, following Aquinas\u2019s commentary\n(lecture 20), Aristotle is not claiming that Callias both is and is\nnot Callias or that he is and is not a human being, for example, but\nthat the term \u201canimal\u201dcovers Callias and those who are not\nCallias and not human beings, as Aristotle himself explains when he\nsays that the major term (\u201canimal\u201d) is more extensive than\nthe middle term (\u201chuman\u201d). (In the syllogism All\nAs are Bs; All Bs are Cs;\ntherefore All As are Cs, \u201cA\u201d is the\nmajor term and \u201cB\u201d is the middle term.)\n\nThere are difficulties with both interpretations. Aristotle starts by\nsaying that no demonstration assumes PNC unless it concludes that\nx is F and not not-F. According to the\nfirst interpretation, Aristotle\u2019s explanation about the major\nand middle term is unnecessary. However, according to the second\ninterpretation, the relationship between Aristotle\u2019s main point\nand his comments about PNC is obscure. The text invites further\nelucidation.",
