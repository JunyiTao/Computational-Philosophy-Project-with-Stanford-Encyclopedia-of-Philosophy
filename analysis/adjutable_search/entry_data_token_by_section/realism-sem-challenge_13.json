    "main_text": "Realism and Anti-Realism in Meta-Ontology\n6. Summary\n\nWe have considered a number of challenges to realism, the thesis that\nthe objects and properties that the world contains, its nature and\nstructure, exist independently of our conception or perception of\nthem. Historically, these challenges came from two camps: (1)\nneo-verificationists led by Dummett who assimilate belief in\nmind-independent world to a belief in a verification-transcendent\nconception of truth which they profess to find unintelligible, and (2)\npragmatists and pluralists led by Putnam who also question the\nintelligibility of the realist\u2019s mind-independent world but for\nreasons independent of any commitment to verificationism. While\nneo-verificationism today claims few adherents, within the ranks of\nanalytic ontologists, pluralism and Carnap\u2019s version of it in\nparticular, has enjoyed something of a revival. Today, the most active\nand engaging debates about realism are meta-ontological ones that\ninvolve neo-Carnapian pluralists and their ontological realist\nopponents. \n\nBoth the historical debate between realists and their anti-realist\nopponents and the meta-ontological debate are still very much open. If\nrealists could provide a plausible theory about how correspondences\nbetween mental symbols and the items in the world to which they refer\nmight be set up, many of these challenges could be met. Alternatively,\nif they could explain how, consistently with our knowledge of a\nmind-independent world, no such correspondences are required to begin\nwith, many of the anti-realist objections would fall away as\nirrelevant. In the absence of such explanations it is still entirely\nreasonable for realists to believe that the correspondences are in\nplace, however, and there can, indeed, be very good evidence for\nbelieving this. Ignorance of Nature\u2019s reference-fixing mechanism\nis no reason for denying it exists.\n",
