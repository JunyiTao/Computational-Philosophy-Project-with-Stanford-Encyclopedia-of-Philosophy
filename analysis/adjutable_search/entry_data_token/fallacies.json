These we\nmay distinguish as the belief and argument conceptions of fallacies.\nAcademic writers who have given the most attention to the subject of\nfallacies insist on, or at least prefer, the argument conception of\nfallacies, but the belief conception is prevalent in popular and\nnon-scholarly discourse. As we shall see, there are yet other\nconceptions of what fallacies are, but the present inquiry focuses on\nthe argument conception of fallacies.\n\nBeing able to detect and avoid fallacies has been viewed as a\nsupplement to criteria of good reasoning. The knowledge of fallacies\nis needed to arm us against the most enticing missteps we might take\nwith arguments\u2014so thought not only Aristotle but also the early\nnineteenth century logicians Richard Whately and John Stuart Mill. But\nas the course of logical theory from the late nineteenth-century\nforward turned more and more to axiomatic systems and formal\nlanguages, the study of reasoning and natural language argumentation\nreceived much less attention, and hence developments in the study of\nfallacies almost came to a standstill. Until well past the middle of\nthe twentieth century, discussions of fallacies were for the most part\nrelegated to introductory level textbooks. It was only when\nphilosophers realized the ill fit between formal logic, on the one\nhand, and natural language reasoning and argumentation, on the other,\nthat the interest in fallacies has returned. Since the 1970s the\nutility of knowing about fallacies has been acknowledged (Johnson and\nBlair 1993), and the way in which fallacies are incorporated into\ntheories of argumentation has been taken as a sign of a theory\u2019s\nlevel of adequacy (Biro and Siegel 2007, van Eemeren 2010).\n\nIn modern fallacy studies it is common to distinguish formal and\ninformal fallacies. Formal fallacies are those readily seen to be\ninstances of identifiable invalid logical forms such as undistributed\nmiddle and denying the antecedent. Although many of the informal\nfallacies are also invalid arguments, it is generally thought to be\nmore profitable, from the points of view of both recognition and\nunderstanding, to bring their weaknesses to light through analyses\nthat do not involve appeal to formal languages. For this reason it has\nbecome the practice to eschew the symbolic language of formal logic in\nthe analysis of these fallacies; hence the term \u2018informal\nfallacy\u2019 has gained wide currency. In the following essay, which\nis in four parts, it is what is considered the informal-fallacy\nliterature that will be reviewed. Part 1 is an introduction to the\ncore fallacies as brought to us by the tradition of the textbooks.\nPart 2 reviews the history of the development of the conceptions of\nfallacies as it is found from Aristotle to Copi. Part 3 surveys some\nof the most recent innovative research on fallacies, and Part 4\nconsiders some of the current research topics in fallacy theory.\n", "toc": [{"#CorFal": "1.

The core fallacies\n\nIrving Copi\u2019s 1961 Introduction to Logic gives a brief\nexplanation of eighteen informal fallacies. Although there is some\nvariation in competing textbooks, Copi\u2019s selection captured what\nfor many was the traditional central, core\n fallacies.[1]\n In the main, these fallacies spring from two fountainheads:\nAristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations and John\nLocke\u2019s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690).\nBy way of introduction, a brief review of the core fallacies,\nespecially as they appear in introductory level textbooks, will be\ngiven. Only very general definitions and illustrations of the\nfallacies can be given. This proviso is necessary first, because, the\ndefinitions (or identity conditions) of each of the fallacies is often\na matter of contention and so no complete or final definition can be\ngiven in an introductory survey; secondly, some researchers wish that\nonly plausible and realistic instances of each fallacy be used for\nillustration. This also is not possible at this stage. The advantage\nof the stock examples of fallacies is that they are designed to\nhighlight what the mistake associated with each kind of fallacy is\nsupposed to be. Additional details about some of the fallacies are\nfound in Sections 2 and 3. As an initial working definition of the\nsubject matter, we may take a fallacy to be an argument that seems to\nbe better than it really is.\n\n1. The fallacy of  equivocation is an argument which exploits\nthe ambiguity of a term or phrase which has occurred at least twice in\nan argument, such that on the first occurrence it has one meaning and\non the second another meaning. A familiar example is:\n\nThe end of life is death.\n\nHappiness is the end of life.\n\nSo, death is happiness.\n\n\u2018The end of life\u2019 first means ceasing to live, then it\nmeans purpose. That the same set of words is used twice conceals the\nfact that the two distinct meanings undermine the continuity of the\nreasoning, resulting in a non-sequitur.\n\n2. The fallacy of amphiboly is, like the fallacy of\nequivocation, a fallacy of ambiguity; but here the ambiguity is due to\nindeterminate syntactic structure. In the argument:\n\nThe police were told to stop drinking on campus after midnight.\n\nSo, now they are able to respond to emergencies much better than\nbefore\n\nthere are several interpretations that can be given to the premise\nbecause it is grammatically ambiguous. On one reading it can be taken\nto mean that it is the police who have been drinking and are now to\nstop it; this makes for a plausible argument. On another reading what\nis meant is that the police were told to stop others (e.g., students)\nfrom drinking after midnight. If that is the sense in which the\npremise is intended, then the argument can be said to be a fallacy\nbecause despite initial appearances, it affords no support for the\nconclusion.\n\n3 & 4. The fallacies of composition and division\noccur when the properties of parts and composites are mistakenly\nthought to be transferable from one to the other. Consider the two\nsentences:\n\nEvery member of the investigative team was an excellent\nresearcher.\nIt was an excellent investigative team.\n\n\nHere it is \u2018excellence\u2019 that is the property in question.\nThe fallacy of composition is the inference from (a) to (b) but it\nneed not hold if members of the team cannot work cooperatively with\neach other. The reverse inference from (b) to (a)\u2014the fallacy of\ndivision\u2014may also fail if some essential members of the team\nhave a supportive or administrative role rather than a research\nrole.\n\n5. The fallacy of begging the question (petitio principii)\ncan occur in a number of ways.  One of them is nicely illustrated with\nWhately\u2019s (1875 III \u00a713) example: \u201cto allow everyman\nan unbounded freedom of speech must always be, on the whole,\nadvantageous to the State; for it is highly conducive to the interest\nof the Community, that each individual should enjoy a liberty\nperfectly unlimited, of expressing his sentiments.\u201d This argument begs\nthe question because the premise and conclusion are the very same\nproposition, albeit expressed in different words. It is a disguised\ninstance of repetition which gives no reason for its apparent\nconclusion.\n\nAnother version of begging the question can occur in contexts of\nargumentation where there are unsettled questions about key terms.\nSuppose, for example, that everyone agrees that to murder someone\nrequires doing something that is wrong, but not everyone agrees that\ncapital punishment is a form of \u2018murder\u2019; some think it is\njustified killing.  Then, should an arguer gives this argument:\n\n  Capital punishment requires an act of murdering human beings.\n  So, capital punishment is wrong.\n\none could say that this is question-begging because in this context of\nargumentation, the arguer is smuggling in as settled a question that\nremains open.  That is, if the premise is accepted without further\njustification, the arguer is assuming the answer to a controversial\nquestion without argument.\n\nNeither of these versions of begging the question are faulted for\ntheir invalidity, so they are not charged with being non-sequitors\nlike most of the core fallacies; they are, however, attempted proofs\nthat do not transparently display their weakness. This consideration,\nplus its ancient lineage back to Aristotle, might explain begging the\nquestion\u2019s persistent inclusion among fallacies.  But, given our\nallegiance to the modern conception of logic as being solely concerned\nwith the following-from relation, forms of begging the question should\nbe thought of as epistemic rather than logical fallacies.\n\nSome versions of begging the question are more involved and are called\ncircular reasoning. They include more than one inference. Descartes\nillustrated this kind of fallacy with the example of our belief in the\nBible being justified because it is the word of God, and our belief in\nGod\u2019s existence being justified because it is written in the \nBible.[2]\n The two propositions lead back and forth to each other, in a circle,\neach having only the support of the other.\n\n6. The fallacy known as complex question or many\nquestions is usually explained as a fallacy associated with\nquestioning. For example, in a context where a Yes or No answer must\nbe given, the question, \u201cAre you still a member of the Ku Klux\nKlan?\u201d is a fallacy because either response implies that one has\nin the past been a member of the Klan, a proposition that may not have\nbeen established as true. Some say that this kind of mistake is not\nreally a fallacy because to ask a question is not to make an\nargument.\n\n7. There are a number of fallacies associated with causation, the most\nfrequently discussed is post hoc ergo propter hoc, (after\nthis, therefore because of this). This fallacy ascribes a causal\nrelationship between two states or events on the basis of temporal\nsuccession. For example,\n\nUnemployment decreased in the fourth quarter because the government\neliminated the gasoline tax in the second quarter.\n\nThe decrease in unemployment that took place after the elimination of\nthe tax may have been due to other causes; perhaps new industrial\nmachinery or increased international demand for products. Other\nfallacies involve confusing the cause and the effect, and overlooking\nthe possibility that two events are not directly related to each other\nbut are both the effect of a third factor, a common cause. These\nfallacies are perhaps better understood as faults of explanation than\nfaults of arguments.\n\n8. The fallacy of ignoratio elenchi, or irrelevant\nconclusion, is indicative of misdirection in argumentation rather than\na weak inference. The claim that Calgary is the fastest growing city\nin Canada, for example, is not defeated by a sound argument showing\nthat it is not the biggest city in Canada. A variation of\nignoratio elenchi, known under the name of the straw man\nfallacy, occurs when an opponent\u2019s point of view is distorted in\norder to make it easier to refute. For example, in opposition to a\nproponent\u2019s view that (a) industrialization is the cause of\nglobal warming, an opponent might substitute the proposition that (b)\nall ills that beset mankind are due to industrialization and then,\nhaving easily shown that (b) is false, leave the impression that (a),\ntoo, is false. Two things went wrong: the proponent does not hold (b),\nand even if she did, the falsity of (b) does not imply the falsity of\n(a).\n\nThere are a number of common fallacies that begin with the Latin\nprefix \u2018ad\u2019 (\u2018to\u2019 or\n\u2018toward\u2019) and the most common of these will be described\nnext.\n\n9. The ad verecundiam fallacy concerns appeals to authority\nor expertise. Fundamentally, the fallacy involves accepting as\nevidence for a proposition the pronouncement of someone who is taken\nto be an authority but is not really an authority. This can happen\nwhen non-experts parade as experts in fields in which they have no\nspecial competence\u2014when, for example, celebrities endorse\ncommercial products or social movements. Similarly, when there is\ncontroversy, and authorities are divided, it is an error to base\none\u2019s view on the authority of just some of them. (See also 2.4\nbelow.)\n\n10. The fallacy ad populum is similar to the ad\nverecundiam, the difference being that the source appealed to is\npopular opinion, or common knowledge, rather than a specified\nauthority. So, for example:\n\nThese days everyone (except you) has a car and knows how to drive;\n\nSo, you too should have a car and know how to drive.\n\nOften in arguments like this the premises aren\u2019t true, but even\nif they are generally true they may provide only scant support for\ntheir conclusions because that something is widely practised or\nbelieved is not compelling evidence that it is true or that it should\nbe done. There are few subjects on which the general public can be\nsaid to hold authoritative opinions. Another version of the ad\npopulum fallacy is known as \u201cplaying to the gallery\u201d\nin which a speaker seeks acceptance for his view by arousing relevant\nprejudices and emotions in his audience in lieu of presenting it with\ngood evidence.\n\n11. The ad baculum fallacy is one of the most controversial\nbecause it is hard to see that it is a fallacy or even that it\ninvolves bad reasoning. Ad baculum means \u201cappeal to the\nstick\u201d and is generally taken to involve a threat of injury of\nharm to the person addressed. So, for example,\n\nIf you don\u2019t join our demonstration against the expansion of the\npark, we will evict you from your apartment;\n\nSo, you should join our demonstration against the expansion of the\npark.\n\nSuch threats do give us reasons to act and, unpleasant as the\ninterlocutor may be, there seems to be no fallacy here. In labour\ndisputes, and perhaps in international relations, using threats such\nas going on strike, or cutting off trade routes, are not normally\nconsidered fallacies, even though they do involve intimidation and the\nthreat of harm. However, if we change to doxastic considerations, then\nthe argument that you should believe that candidate \\(X\\) is\nthe one best suited for public office because if you do not believe\nthis you will be evicted from your apartment, certainly is a good\ninstance of irrelevant evidence.\n\n12. The fallacy ad misericordiam is a companion to the ad\nbaculum fallacy: it occurs not when threats are out of place but\nwhen appeals for sympathy or pity are mistakenly thought to be\nevidence. To what extent our sympathy for others should influence our\nactions depends on many factors, including circumstances and our\nethical views. However, sympathy alone is generally not evidence for\nbelieving any proposition. Hence,\n\nYou should believe that he is not guilty of embezzling those\npaintings; think of how much his family suffered during the\nDepression.\n\nAd misericordiam arguments, like ad baculum\narguments, have their natural home in practical reasoning; it is when\nthey are used in theoretical (doxastic) argumentation that the\npossibility of fallacy is more likely.\n\n13. The ad hominem fallacy involves bringing negative aspects\nof an arguer, or their situation, to bear on the view they are\nadvancing. There are three commonly recognized versions of the\nfallacy. The abusive ad hominem fallacy involves saying that\nsomeone\u2019s view should not be accepted because they have some\nunfavorable property.\n\nThompson\u2019s proposal for the wetlands may safely be rejected\nbecause last year she was arrested for hunting without a license.\n\nThe hunter Thompson, although she broke the law, may nevertheless have\na very good plan for the wetlands.\n\nAnother, more subtle version of the fallacy is the circumstantial\nad hominem in which, given the circumstances in which the\narguer finds him or herself, it is alleged that their position is\nsupported by self-interest rather than by good evidence. Hence, the\nscientific studies produced by industrialists to show that the levels\nof pollution at their factories are within the law may be undeservedly\nrejected because they are thought to be self-serving. Yet it is\npossible that the studies are sound: just because what someone says is\nin their self-interest, does not mean it should be rejected.\n\nThe third version of the ad hominem fallacy is the tu\nquoque. It involves not accepting a view or a recommendation\nbecause the espouser him- or herself does not follow it. Thus, if our\nneighbor advises us to exercise regularly and we reject her advice on\nthe basis that she does not exercise regularly, we commit the tu\nquoque fallacy: the value of advice is not wholly dependent on\nthe integrity of the advisor.\n\nWe may finish our survey of the core fallacies by considering just two\nmore.\n\n14. The fallacy of faulty analogy occurs when analogies are\nused as arguments or explanations and the similarities between the two\nthings compared are too remote to support the conclusion.\n\nIf a child gets a new toy he or she will want to play with it;\n\nSo, if a nation gets new weapons, it will want to use them.\n\nIn this example (due to Churchill 1986, 349) there is a great\ndifference between using (playing with) toys and using (discharging)\nweapons. The former is done for amusement, the latter is done to\ninflict harm on others. Playing with toys is a benign activity that\nrequires little justification; using weapons against others nations is\nsomething that is usually only done after extensive deliberation and\nas a last resort. Hence, there is too much of a difference between\nusing toys and using weapons to conclude that a nation, if it acquires\nweapons, will want to use them as readily as children will want to\nplay with their toys.\n\n15. The fallacy of the slippery slope generally takes the\nform that from a given starting point one can by a series of\nincremental inferences arrive at an undesirable conclusion, and\nbecause of this unwanted result, the initial starting point should be\nrejected. The kinds of inferences involved in the step-by-step\nargument can be causal, as in:\n\nYou have decided not to go to college;\n\nIf you don\u2019t go to college, you won\u2019t get a degree;\n\nIf you don\u2019t get a degree, you won\u2019t get a good job;\n\nIf you don\u2019t get a good job, you won\u2019t be able to enjoy\nlife;\n\nBut you should be able to enjoy life;\n\nSo, you should go to college.\n\nThe weakness in this argument, the reason why it is a fallacy, lies in\nthe second and third causal claims. The series of small steps that\nlead from an acceptable starting point to an unacceptable conclusion\nmay also depend on vague terms rather than causal relations. Lack of\nclear boundaries is what enables the puzzling slippery slope arguments\nknown as \u201cthe beard\u201d and \u201cthe heap.\u201d In the\nformer, a person with a full beard eventually becomes beardless as\nhairs of the beard are removed one-by-one; but because the term\n\u2018beard\u2019 is vague it is unclear at which intermediate point\nwe are to say that the man is now beardless. Hence, at each step in\nthe argument until the final hair-plucking, we should continue to\nconclude that the man is bearded. In the second case, because\n\u2018heap\u2019 is vague, it is unclear at what point piling\nscattered stones together makes them a heap of stones: if it is not a\nheap to begin with, adding one more stone will not make it a heap,\netc. In both these cases apparently good reasoning leads to a false\nconclusion.\n\nMany other fallacies have been named and discussed, some of them quite\ndifferent from the ones mentioned above, others interesting and novel\nvariations of the above. Some of these will be mentioned in the review\nof historical and contemporary sources that follows.\n2. History of Fallacy Theory\n2.1 Aristotle\n\nThe history of the study of fallacies begins with Aristotle\u2019s\nwork, On Sophistical Refutations. It is among his earlier\nwritings and the work appears to be a continuation of the\nTopics, his treatise on dialectical argumentation. Although\nhis most extensive and theoretically detailed discussion of fallacies\nis in the Sophistical Refutations, Aristotle also discusses\nfallacies in the Prior Analytics and On Rhetoric.\nHere we will concentrate on summarizing the account given in the\nSophistical Refutations. In that work, four things are worth\nnoting: (a) the different conceptions of fallacy; (b) the basic\nconcepts used to explain fallacies; (c) Aristotle\u2019s explanation\nof why fallacies can be deceptive; and (d) his enumeration and\nclassification of fallacies.\n2.1.1 Definitions\n\nAt the beginning of Topics (I, i), Aristotle distinguishes\nseveral kinds of deductions (syllogisms). They are distinguished first\non the basis of the status of their premises. (1) Those that begin\nfrom true and primary premises, or are owed to such, are\ndemonstrations. (2) Those which have dialectical\npremises\u2014propositions acceptable to most people, or to the\nwise\u2014are dialectical deductions. (3) Deductions that start from\npremises which only appear to be dialectical, are fallacious\ndeductions because of their starting points, as are (4) those\n\u201cdeductions\u201d that do have dialectical premises but do not\nreally necessitate their conclusions. Other fallacies mentioned and\nassociated with demonstrations are (5) those which only appear to\nstart from what is true and primary (Top., I, i 101a5). What\nthis classification leaves out are (6) the arguments that do start\nfrom true and primary premises but then fail to necessitate their\nconclusions; two of these, begging the question and non-cause are\ndiscussed in Prior Analytics (II, 16, 17). It is the\n\u201cfallacious deductions\u201d characterized in (4), however,\nthat come closest to the focus of the Sophistical\nRefutations. Nevertheless, in many of the examples given what\nstands out is that the premises are given as answers in dialogue and\nare to be maintained by the answerer, not necessarily that they are\ndialectical in the sense of being common opinions. This variation on\ndialectical deductions Aristotle calls examination arguments\n(SR 2 165b4).\n2.1.2 The basic concepts\n\nThere are three closely related concepts needed to understand\nsophistical refutations. By a deduction (a\n syllogism[3])\n Aristotle meant an argument which satisfies three conditions: it\n\u201cis based on certain statements made in such a way as\nnecessarily to cause the assertion of things other than those\nstatements and as a result of those statements\u201d (SR 1\n165a1\u20132). Thus an argument may fail to be a syllogism in three\ndifferent ways. The premises may fail to necessitate the conclusion,\nthe conclusion may be the same as one of the premises, and the\nconclusion may not be caused by (grounded in) the premises. The\nconcept of a proof underlying Sophistical\nRefutations is similar to what is demanded of demonstrative\nknowledge in Posterior Analytics (I ii 71b20), viz., that the\npremises must be \u201ctrue, primary, immediate, better known than,\nprior to, and causative of the conclusion,\u201d except that the\nfirst three conditions do not apply to deductions in which the\npremises are obtained through questioning. A refutation,\nAristotle says, is \u201ca proof of the contradictory\u201d\n(SR 6, 168a37)\u2014a proof of the proposition which is the\ncontradictory of the thesis maintained by the answerer. In a context\nof someone, S, maintaining a thesis, T, a\ndialectical refutation will consist in asking questions of S,\nand then taking S\u2019s answers and using them as the\npremises of a proof via a deduction of not-T: this will be a\nrefutation of T relative to the answerer (SR 8\n170a13). The concept of contradiction can be found in\nCategories: it is those contraries which are related such\nthat \u201cone opposite needs must be true, while the other must\nalways be false\u201d (13b2\u20133). A refutation will be\nsophistical if either the proof is only an apparent proof or the\ncontradiction is only an apparent contradiction. Either way, according\nto Aristotle, there is a fallacy. Hence, the opening of his treatise:\n\u201cLet us now treat of sophistical refutations, that is, arguments\nwhich appear to be refutations but are really fallacies and not\nrefutations\u201d (SR 1 164a20).\n2.1.3 The appearance condition\n\nAristotle observed that \u201creasoning and refutation are sometimes\nreal and sometimes not, but appear to be real owing to men\u2019s\ninexperience; for the inexperienced are like those who view things\nfrom a distance\u201d (SR, 1 164b25). The ideas here are\nfirst that there are arguments that appear to be better than they\nreally are; and second that people inexperienced in arguments may\nmistake the appearance for the reality and thus be taken in by a bad\nargument or refutation. Apparent refutations are primarily explained\nin terms of apparent deductions: thus, with one exception,\nAristotle\u2019s fallacies are in the main a catalogue of bad\ndeductions that appear to be good deductions. The exception is\nignoratio elenchi in which, in one of its guises, the\ndeduction contains no fallacy but the conclusion proved only appears\nto contradict the answerer\u2019s thesis.\n\nAristotle devotes considerable space to explaining how the appearance\ncondition may arise. At the outset he mentions the argument that turns\nupon names (SR 1 165a6), saying that it is the most prolific\nand usual explanation: because there are more things than names, some\nnames will have to denote more than one thing, thereby creating the\npossibility of ambiguous terms and expressions. That the ambiguous use\nof a term goes unnoticed allows the illusion that an argument is a\nreal deduction. The explanation of how the false appearance can arise\nis in the similarity of words or expressions with different meanings,\nand the smallness of differences in meaning between some expressions\n(SR 7 169a23\u2013169b17).\n2.1.4 List and classification\n\nAristotle discusses thirteen ways in which refutations can be\nsophistical and divides them into two groups. The first group,\nintroduced in Chapter 4 of On Sophistical Refutations,\nincludes those Aristotle considers dependent on language (in\ndictione), and the second group, introduced in Chapter 5,\nincludes those characterized as not being dependent on language\n(extra dictionem). Chapter 6 reviews all the fallacies from\nthe view point of failed refutations, and Chapter 7 explains how the\nappearance of correctness is made possible for each fallacy. Chapters\n19\u201330 advise answerers on how to avoid being taken in by\nsophistical refutations.\n\nThe fallacies dependent on language are equivocation, amphiboly,\ncombination of words, division of words, accent and form of\nexpression. Of these the first two have survived pretty much as\nAristotle thought of them. Equivocation results from the exploitation\nof a term\u2019s ambiguity and amphiboly comes about through\nindefinite grammatical structure. The one has to do with semantical\nambiguity, the other with syntactical ambiguity. However, the way that\nAristotle thought of the combination and division fallacies differs\nsignificantly from modern treatments of composition and division.\nAristotle\u2019s fallacies are the combinations and divisions of\nwords which alter meanings, e.g., \u201cwalk while sitting\u201d vs.\n\u201cwalk-while-sitting,\u201d (i.e., to have the ability to walk\nwhile seated vs. being able to walk and sit at the same time). For\ndivision, Aristotle gives the example of the number 5: it is 2 and 3.\nBut 2 is even and 3 is odd, so 5 is even and odd. Double meaning is\nalso possible with those words whose meanings depend on how they are\npronounced, this is the fallacy of accent, but there were no accents\nin written Greek in Aristotle\u2019s day; accordingly, this fallacy\nwould be more likely in written work. What Aristotle had in mind is\nsomething similar to the double meanings that can be given to\n\u2018unionized\u2019 and \u2018invalid\u2019 depending on how\nthey are pronounced. Finally, the fallacy that Aristotle calls form of\nexpression exploits the kind of ambiguity made possible by what we\nhave come to call category mistakes, in this case, fitting words to\nthe wrong categories. Aristotle\u2019s example is the word\n\u2018flourishing\u2019 which may appear to be a verb because of its\n\u2018ing\u2019 ending (as in \u2018cutting\u2019 or\n\u2018running\u2019) and so belongs to the category of actions,\nwhereas it really belongs in the category of quality. Category\nconfusion was, for Aristotle, the key cause of metaphysical\nmistakes.\n\nThere are seven kinds of sophistical refutation that can occur in the\ncategory of refutations not dependent on language: accident,\nsecundum quid, consequent, non-cause, begging the question,\nignoratio elenchi and many questions.\n\nThe fallacy of accident is the most elusive of the fallacies on\nAristotle\u2019s list. It turns on his distinction between two kinds\nof predication, unique properties and accidents (Top. I 5).\nThe fallacy is defined as occurring when \u201cit is claimed that\nsome attribute belongs similarly to the thing and to its\naccident\u201d (SR 5 166b28). What belongs to a thing are\nits unique properties which are counterpredicable (Smith 1997, 60),\ni.e., if \\(A\\) is an attribute of \\(B\\), \\(B\\) is an attribute of\n\\(A\\). However, attributes that are accidents are not\ncounterpredicates and to treat them as such is false reasoning, and\ncan lead to paradoxical results; for example, if it is a property of\ntriangles that they are equal to two right angles, and a triangle is\naccidentally a first principle, it does not follow that all first\nprinciples have two right angles (see Schreiber 2001, ch. 7).\n\nAristotle considers the fallacy of consequent to be a special case of\nthe fallacy of accident, observing that consequence is not\nconvertible, i.e., \u201cif \\(A\\) is, \\(B\\) necessarily is, men also\nfancy that, if \\(B\\) is, \\(A\\) necessarily is\u201d (SR 5\n169b3). One of Aristotle\u2019s examples is that it does not follow\nthat \u201ca man who is hot must be in a fever because a man who is\nin a fever is hot\u201d (SR 5 169b19). This fallacy is\nsometimes claimed as being an early statement of the formal fallacy of\naffirming the consequent.\n\nThe fallacy of secundum quid comes about from failing to\nappreciate the distinction between using words absolutely and using\nthem with qualification. Spruce trees, for example, are green with\nrespect to their foliage (they are \u2018green\u2019 with\nqualification); it would be a mistake to infer that they are green\nabsolutely because they have brown trunks and branches. It is because\nthe difference between using words absolutely and with qualification\ncan be minute that this fallacy is possible, thinks Aristotle.\n\nBegging the question is explained as asking for the answer (the\nproposition) which one is supposed to prove, in order to avoid having\nto make a proof of it. Some subtlety is needed to bring about this\nfallacy such as a clever use of synonymy or an intermixing of\nparticular and universal propositions (Top. VIII, 13). If the\nfallacy succeeds the result is that there will be no deduction:\nbegging the question and non-cause are directly prohibited by the\nsecond and third conditions respectively of being a deduction\n(SR 6 168b23).\n\nThe fallacy of non-cause occurs in contexts of ad impossibile\narguments when one of the assumed premises is superfluous for deducing\nthe conclusion. The superfluous premise will then not be a factor in\ndeducing the conclusion and it will be a mistake to infer that it is\nfalse since it is a non-cause of the impossibility. This is not the\nsame fallacy mentioned by Aristotle in the Rhetoric (II 24)\nwhich is more akin to a fallacy of empirical causation and is better\ncalled false cause (see Woods and Hansen 2001).\n\nAristotle\u2019s fallacy of many questions occurs when two questions\nare asked as if they are one proposition. A proposition is \u201ca\nsingle predication about a single subject\u201d (SR 6\n169a8). Thus with a single answer to two questions one has two\npremises for a refutation , and one of them may turn out to be idle,\nthus invalidating the deduction (it becomes a non-cause fallacy). Also\npossible is that extra-linguistic part-whole mistakes may happen when,\nfor example, given that something is partly good and partly not-good,\nthe double question is asked whether it is all good or all not-good?\nEither answer will lead to a contradiction (see Schreiber 2000,\n156\u201359). Despite its name, this fallacy consists in the ensuing\ndeduction, not in the question which merely triggers the fallacy.\n\nOn one interpretation ignoratio elenchi is considered to be\nAristotle\u2019s thirteenth fallacy, in which an otherwise successful\ndeduction fails to end with the required contradictory of the\nanswerer\u2019s thesis. Seen this way, ignoratio elenchi is\nunlike all the other fallacies in that it is not an argument that\nfails to meet one of the criteria of a good deduction, but a genuine\ndeduction that turns out to be irrelevant to the point at issue. On\nanother reading, ignoratio elenchi is not a separate fallacy\nbut an alternative to the language dependent / language independent\nway of classifying the other twelve fallacies: they all fail to meet,\nin one way or another, the requirements of a sound refutation.\n\n[A] refutation is a contradiction of one and the same predicate, not\nof a name but of a thing, and not of a synonymous name but of an\nidentical name, based on the given premises and following necessarily\nfrom them (the original point at issue not being included) in the same\nrespect, manner and time. (SR 5 167a23\u201327)\n\n\nEach of the other twelve fallacies is analysed as failing to meet one\nof the conditions in this definition of refutation (SR 6).\nAristotle seems to favour this second reading, but it leaves the\nproblem of explaining how refutations that miss their mark can seem\nlike successful refutations. A possible explanation is that a failure\nto contradict a given thesis can be made explicit by adding the\nnegation of the thesis as a last step of the deduction, thereby\ninsuring the contradiction of the thesis, but only at the cost (by the\nlast step) of introducing one of the other twelve fallacies in the\ndeduction.\n2.1.5 Different interpretations\n\nI have given only the briefest possible explanation of\nAristotle\u2019s fallacies. To really understand them a much longer\nengagement with the original text and the secondary sources is\nnecessary. The second chapter of Hamblin\u2019s (1970) book is a\nuseful introduction to the Sophistical Refutations, and a\ndefence of the dialectical nature of the fallacies. Hamblin thinks\nthat a dialectical framework is indispensable for an understanding of\nAristotle\u2019s fallacies and that part of the poverty of\ncontemporary accounts of fallacies is due to a failure to understand\ntheir assumed dialectical setting. This approach to the fallacies is\ncontinued in contemporary research by some argumentation theorists,\nmost notably Douglas Walton (1995) who also follows Aristotle in\nrecognizing a number of different kinds of dialogues in which\nargumentation can occur; Frans van Eemeren and Rob Grootendorst (2004)\nwho combine dialectical and pragmatic insights with an ideal model of\na critical discussion; and Jaakko Hintikka who analyses the\nAristotelian fallacies as mistakes in question-dialogues (Hintikka\n1987; Bachman 1995.) According to Hintikka (1997) it is an outright\nmistake to think of Aristotle\u2019s fallacies primarily as mistaken\ninferences, either deductive or inductive. A non-dialogue oriented\ninterpretation of Aristotle fallacies is found in Woods and Hansen\n(1997 and 2001) who argue that the fallacies (apparent deductions) are\nbasic to apparent refutations, and that Aristotle\u2019s interest in\nthe fallacies extended beyond dialectical contests, as is shown by his\ninterest in them in the Prior Analytics and the\nRhetoric (II 24). What gives unity to Aristotle\u2019s\ndifferent fallacies on this view is not a dialogue structure but\nrather their dependence on the concepts of deduction and proof. The\nmost thorough recent study of these questions is in Schreiber (2003),\nwho emphasizes Aristotle\u2019s concern with resolving (exposing)\nfallacies and argues that it is Aristotelian epistemology and\nmetaphysics that is needed for a full understanding of the fallacies\nin the Sophistical Refutations.\n2.2 Bacon\n\nFrancis Bacon deserves a brief mention in the history of fallacy\ntheory, not because he made any direct contribution to our knowledge\nof the fallacies but because of his attention to prejudice and bias in\nscientific investigation, and the effect they could have on our\nbeliefs. He spoke of false idols (1620, aphorisms 40\u201344) as\nhaving the same relation to the interpretation of nature that\nfallacies have to logic. The idol of the tribe is human nature which\ndistorts our view of the natural world (it is a false mirror). The\nidol of the cave is the peculiarity of each individual man, our\ndifferent abilities and education that affect how we interpret nature.\nThe idols of the theatre are the acquired false philosophies, systems\nand methods, both new and ancient, that rule men\u2019s minds. These\nthree idols all fall into the category of explanations of why we may\nmisperceive the world. A fourth of Bacon\u2019s idols, the idol of\nthe market place, is the one that comes closest to the Aristotelian\ntradition as it points to language as the source of our mistaken\nideas: \u201cwords plainly force and overrule the understanding, and\nthrow all into confusion, and lead men away into numberless empty\ncontroversies and idle fancies\u201d (1620, aphorism 43). Although\nBacon identifies no particular fallacies in Aristotle\u2019s sense,\nhe opens the door to the possibility that there may be false\nassumptions associated with the investigation of the natural world.\nThe view of The New Organon is that just as logic is the cure\nfor fallacies, so will the true method of induction be a cure for the\nfalse idols.\n2.3 Arnauld and Nicole\n\nAntoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole were the authors of Logic, or\nthe Art of Thinking (1662), commonly known as the Port-Royal\nLogic. According to Benson Mates (1965, 214) it \u201cis an\noutstanding early example of the \u2018how to think straight\u2019\ngenre.\u201d The work includes chapters on sophisms, with the\njustification that \u201cexamples of mistakes to be avoided are often\nmore striking than the examples to be imitated\u201d (Bk. III, xix).\nThe Port-Royal Logic does not continue Aristotle\u2019s distinction\nbetween fallacies that are dependent on language and those that are\nnot; instead there is a division between sophisms associated with\nscientific subjects (ibid.)\u2014these are nearly all from the\nSophistical Refutations\u2014and those committed in everyday\nlife and ordinary discourse (Bk III, xx). The division is not\nexclusive, with some of the sophisms fitting both classes.\n\nThe Port-Royal Logic includes eight of Aristotle\u2019s original\nthirteen fallacies, several of them modified to fit the bent to\nnatural philosophy rather than dialectical argumentation. Several\nkinds of causal errors are considered under the broad heading, non\ncausa pro causa and they are illustrated with reference to\nscientific explanations that have assigned false causes for empirical\nphenomena. Also identified as a common fallacy of the human mind is\npost hoc, ergo propter hoc: \u201cThis happened following a\ncertain thing, hence that thing must be its cause\u201d (Bk. III, xix\n3). Begging the questions is included and illustrated, interestingly,\nwith examples drawn from Aristotelian science. Two new sophisms are\nincluded: one is imperfect enumeration, the error of overlooking an\nalternative, the other is a faulty (incomplete) induction, what we\nmight call hasty generalization. Although the discussions here are\nbrief, they mark the entry of inductive fallacies into the pool of\npresent day recognized fallacies. Ignoratio elenchi retains\nits dialogical setting but is extended beyond the mere failure to\ncontradict a thesis, \u201cto attribut[ing] to our adversaries\nsomething remote from their views to gain an advantage over them, or\nto impute to them consequences we imagine can be drawn from their\ndoctrines, although they disavow and deny them\u201d (Bk. III, xix\n1). The other Aristotelian fallacies included are accident,\ncombination and division, secundum quid and ambiguity.\n\nThe sophisms of everyday life and ordinary discourse are eight in\nnumber and two of them, the sophisms of authority and manner, should\nbe noticed. In these sophisms, external marks of speakers contribute\nto the persuasiveness of their arguments. Although authority is not to\nbe doubted in church doctrines, in matters that God has left to the\ndiscernment of humans we can be led away from the truth by being too\ndeferential. Here we find one of the earliest statements of the modern\nappeal to false authority: people are often persuaded by certain\nqualities that are irrelevant to the truth of the issue being\ndiscussed. Thus there are a number of people who unquestioningly\nbelieve those who are the oldest and most experienced, even in matters\nthat depend neither on age nor experience, but only on mental insight\n(Bk. III, xx 6). To age and experience Arnauld and Nicole add noble\nbirth as an unwarranted source of deference in matters intellectual\n(Bk. III, xx 7), and towards the end of their discussion they add the\nsophism of manner, cautioning that \u201cgrace, fluency, seriousness,\nmoderation and gentleness\u201d is not necessarily a mark of truth\n(Bk. III, xx 8). The authors seem to have the rhetorical flourishes of\nroyal courtiers especially in mind.\n2.4 Locke\n\nIt is John Locke who is credited with intentionally creating a class\nof ad-arguments, and inadvertently giving birth to the class\nof ad-fallacies. In An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1690), he identified three kinds of arguments, the\nad verecundiam, ad ignorantiam, and ad\nhominem arguments, each of which he contrasted with ad\njudicium arguments which are arguments based on \u201cthe\nfoundations of knowledge and probability\u201d and are reliable\nroutes to truth and knowledge. Locke did not speak of\nad-arguments as fallacies\u2014that was left to others to do\nlater\u2014but rather as kinds of arguments \u201cthat men, in their\nreasoning with others, do ordinarily make use of to prevail on their\nassent; or at least so to awe them as to silence their\nopposition.\u201d (Bk IV, xvii, 19\u201322).\n\nTwo of the ad arguments have developed beyond how Locke\noriginally conceived them. His characterization of the ad\nverecundiam is considered the locus classicus of\nappeal-to-authority arguments. When it is a fallacy it is either on\nthe ground that authorities (experts) are fallible or for the reason\nthat appealing to authority is an abandonment of an individual\u2019s\nepistemic responsibility. It seems unlikely, however, that Locke\nthought we should never rely on the expertise and superior knowledge\nof others when engaged in knowledge-gathering and argumentation. This\nleads us to consider what kind of authority Locke might have had in\nmind. In addition to epistemic and legal (command) authority there is\nalso what might be called social authority, demanding respect and\ndeference from others due to one\u2019s higher social standing,\nsomething much more a part of seventeenth-century society than it is a\npart of ours. The language that Locke used in connection with the\nad verecundiam, words like \u2018eminency\u2019,\n\u2018dignity\u2019, \u2018breach of modesty\u2019, and\n\u2018having too much pride\u2019 suggests that what he had in mind\nwas the kind of authority that demands respect for the social standing\nof sources rather than for their expertise; hence, by this kind of\nauthority a person could be led to accept a conclusion because of\ntheir modesty or shame, more so than for the value of the argument\n(see Goodwin 1998, Hansen 2006). Hence, we understand Locke better\nwhen we translate ad verecundiam literally, as \u201cappeal\nto modesty.\u201d\n\nThe argumentum ad hominem, as Locke defined it, has\nsubsequently developed into three different fallacies. His original\ndescription was that it was a way \u201cto press a man with\nconsequences drawn from his own principles or concessions.\u201d That\nis, to argue that an opponent\u2019s view is inconsistent, logically\nor pragmatically, with other things he has said or to which he is\ncommitted. Locke\u2019s observation was that such arguments do not\nadvance us towards truth, but that they can serve to promote agreement\nor stall disagreement. To argue that way is not a fallacy but an\nacceptable mode of argumentation. Henry Johnstone (1952) thought it\ncaptured the essential character of philosophical argumentation. The\nmodern descendants of the Lockean ad hominem are the abusive\nad hominem which is an argument to the effect that a position\nshould not be accepted because of some telling negative property of\nits espouser; the circumstantial ad hominem, an argument to\nthe effect that someone\u2019s position should be rejected because\ncircumstances suggest that their view is the result of self-interested\nbias; and finally, the tu quoque ad hominem argument which\nattempts to deflect a criticism by pointing out that it applies\nequally to the accuser. Recent scholarship suggests that these\npost-Lockean kinds of ad hominem arguments are sometimes used\nfairly, and sometimes fallaciously; but none of them is what Locke\ndescribed as the argumentum ad hominem.\n\nAd ignorantiam translates as \u201cappeal to\nignorance.\u201d Locke\u2019s characterization of this kind of\nargument is that it demands \u201cthe adversary to admit what they\nallege as a proof, or to assign a better.\u201d The ignorance in\nquestion is comparative, it is not that the opponent has no evidence,\nit is that s/he has no better evidence. However, the inability of an\nopponent to produce a better argument is not sufficient reason to\nthink the proponent\u2019s argument must be accepted. Modern versions\nof this kind of argument take it as a fallacy to infer a proposition\nto be true because there is no evidence against it (see Krabbe,\n1995).\n\nThe introduction and discussion of the ad-arguments appears\nalmost as an afterthought in Locke\u2019s Essay. It is found\nat the end of the chapter, \u201cOf Reason,\u201d in which Locke\ndevotes considerable effort to criticizing syllogistic logic.\nReasoning by syllogisms, he maintained, was neither necessary nor\nuseful for knowledge. Locke clearly thought that the three\nad-arguments were inferior to ad judicium arguments,\nbut he never used the term \u2018fallacy\u2019 in connection with\nthem, although he did use it in connection with errors of syllogistic\nreasoning.\n\nWas Locke the first to discuss these kinds of arguments? Hamblin\n(1970, 161\u201362) and Nuchelmans (1993) trace the idea of ad\nhominem arguments back to Aristotle, and Locke\u2019s remark\nthat the name argumentum ad hominem was already known has\nbeen investigated by Finocchiaro (1974) who finds the term and the\nargument kind in Galileo\u2019s writings more than a half-century\nbefore the Essay Concerning Human Understanding. And Arnauld\nand Nicole\u2019s discussion of the sophism of authority, that\n\u201cpeople speak the truth because they are of noble birth or\nwealthy or in high office,\u201d which seems to be part of\nLocke\u2019s ad verecundiam, was most likely known to him.\nSubsequently more ad-arguments were added to the four that\nLocke identified (see Watts, and Copi, below).\n2.5 Watts\n\nIsaac Watts in his Logick; or, The Right Use of Reason\n(1724), furthered the ad-argument tradition by adding three\nmore arguments: argumentum ad fidem (appeal to faith),\nargumentum ad passiones (appeal to passion), and\nargumentum ad populum (a public appeal to passions). Like\nLocke, Watts does not consider these arguments as fallacies but as\nkinds of arguments. However, the Logick does consider\nsophisms and introduces \u201cfalse cause\u201d as an alternative\nname for non causa pro causa which here, as in the Port-Royal\nLogic, is understood as a fallacy associated with empirical causation.\nAccording to Watts it occurs whenever anyone assigns \u201cthe\nreasons of natural appearances, without sufficient experiments to\nprove them\u201d (1796, Pt. III, 3 i 4). Another sophism included by\nWatts is imperfect enumeration or false induction, the mistake of\ngeneralizing on insufficient evidence. Also, the term \u2018strawman\nfallacy\u2019 may have its origins in Watts\u2019s discussion of\nignoratio elenchi: after having dressed up the opinions and\nsentiments of their adversaries as they please to make \u201cimages\nof straw\u201d, disputers \u201ctriumph over their adversary as\nthough they had utterly confuted his opinions\u201d (1796, Pt. III 3\ni 1).\n2.6 Bentham\n\nJeremy Bentham\u2019s Handbook of Political Fallacies (1824)\nwas written in the years leading up to the first Reform Bill (1832).\nHis interest was in political argumentation, particularly in exposing\nthe different means used by parliamentarians and law makers to defeat\nor delay reform legislation. Hence, it was not philosophy or science\nthat interested him, but political debate. Fallacies he took to be\narguments or topics that would through the use of deception produce\nerroneous beliefs in people (1824, 3). These tactics he (or his\neditor) divided into four classes: fallacies of authority, danger,\ndelay and confusion. Bentham was aware of the developing\nad-fallacies tradition since each of the thirty or so\nfallacies he described is also labelled as belonging either to the\nkind ad verecundiam (appeal to shame or modesty), ad\nodium (appeal to hate or contempt),  ad metum (appeal to\nfear or threats), ad quietem (appeal to rest or inaction),\nad judicium, and ad socordiam (appeal to\npostponement or delay). Most of Bentham\u2019s fallacies have not\nbecome staples of fallacy theory but many of them show interesting\ninsights into the motives and techniques of debaters (see e.g.,\nRudanko\u2019s (2005, 2009) analyses of the ad\nsocordiam).\n\nBentham\u2019s Handbook has not taken a central place in the\nhistory of fallacy studies (Hamblin 1970, 165\u201369); nevertheless,\nit is historically interesting in several respects. It discusses\nauthority at length, identifying four conditions for reliable appeals\nto authority and maintaining that the failure of any one of them\ncancels the strength of the appeal. Fallacies of authority in\npolitical debate occur when authority \u201cis employed in the place\nof such relevant arguments as might have been brought forward\u201d\n(1824, 25). Bentham\u2019s fear is that debaters will resort to\n\u201cthe authority\u201d of traditional beliefs and principles\ninstead of considering the advantages of the reform measures under\ndiscussion.\n\nUnder the heading \u201cfallacies of danger\u201d Bentham named a\nnumber of what he called vituperative fallacies\u2014imputations of\nbad character, bad motive, inconsistency, and suspicious\nconnections\u2014which have as their common characteristic,\n\u201cthe endeavour to draw aside attention from the measure\nto the man, in such a way as to cause the latter\u2019s\nbadness to be imputed to the measure he supports, or his goodness to\nhis opposition\u201d (1824, 83). This characterization fits well with\nthe way we have come to think of the ad hominem fallacy as a\nview disparaged by putting forth a negative characterization of its\nsupporter or his circumstances.\n\nBentham places the fallacies in the immediate context of debate,\nidentifying ways in which arguers frustrate the eventual resolution of\ndisagreements by using insinuations of danger, delaying tactics,\nappeals to questionable authorities and, generally, confusing issues.\nModern argumentation theorists who hold that any impediment to the\nsuccessful completion of dialogical discussions is a fallacy, may find\nthat their most immediate precursor was Bentham (see Grootendorst\n1997).\n2.7 Whately\n\nBook III of Richard Whately\u2019s Elements of Logic (1826)\nis devoted to giving an account of fallacies based on \u201clogical\nprinciples,\u201d. Whately was instrumental in the revival of\ninterest in logic at the beginning of the nineteenth century and,\nbeing committed to deductivism, he maintained that only valid\ndeductive inferences counted as reasoning. Thus, he took every fallacy\nto belong to either the class of deductive failures (logical\nfallacies) or the class of non-logical failures (material\nfallacies).\n\nBy \u2018fallacy\u2019 Whately meant \u201cany unsound mode of\narguing, which appears to demand our conviction, and to be decisive of\nthe question at hand, when in fairness it is not\u201d\u2019 (Bk.\nIII, intro.). The logical fallacies divide into the purely logical and\nthe semi-logical fallacies. The purely logical fallacies are plain\nviolations of syllogistic rules like undistributed middle and illicit\nprocess. The semi-logical fallacies mostly trade on ambiguous middle\nterms and are therefore also logical fallacies, but their detection\nrequires extra-logical knowledge including that of the senses of\n terms[4]\n and knowledge of the subject matter (Bk. III, \u00a72); they include,\namong others, the fallacies of ambiguity, and division and\ncomposition. The non-logical, material fallacies are also divided into\ntwo classes: fallacies with premises \u2018unduly assumed,\u2019 and\nfallacies of irrelevant conclusions. Begging the question fits under\nthe heading of a non-logical, material fallacy in which a premise has\nbeen unduly assumed, and ignoratio elenchi is a non-logical,\nmaterial fallacy in which an irrelevant conclusion has been reached.\nThe ad-arguments are all placed under the last division as\nvariants of ignoratio elenchi, but they are said to be\nfallacies only when they are used unfairly. Whately\u2019s version of\nthe ad hominem argument resembles Locke\u2019s in that it is\nan ex concessis kind of argument: one that depends on the\nconcessions of the person with whom one is arguing. From the\nconcessions, one might prove that one\u2019s opponent is\n\u2018committed to p,\u2019 but an attempt to make it seem\nas if this constitutes a proof of the absolute (non-relative)\nproposition \u2018p\u2019 would be a fallacy. This kind of\nad hominem fallacy can be seen as falling under the broader\nignoratio elenchi category because what is proved is not what\nis needed.\n\nThe creation of the category of non-logical fallacies was not really a\nbreak with Aristotle as much as it was a break with what had become\nthe Aristotelian tradition. Aristotle thought that some fallacies were\ndue to unacceptable premises although these are not elaborated in\nSophistical Refutations (see section 2.1.1 above).\nWhately\u2019s creation of the category of non-logical fallacies\nsolved the problem of what to do with begging the question which is\nnot an invalid form of argument, and it also created a place in\nfallacy taxonomy for the ad-fallacies.\n2.8 Mill\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s contribution to the study of fallacies is\nfound in Book V of his comprehensive A System of Logic,\nRatiocinative and Inductive, first published in 1843. It stands\nout most strikingly for placing the study of fallacies within his\nframework of inductive reasoning, a direct rejection of\nWhately\u2019s deductivist approach to reasoning and fallacies. Mill\nheld that only inductive reasoning counts as inferring and accordingly\nhe introduces new categories as well as a new classification scheme\nfor fallacies.\n\nMill drew a division between the moral and the intellectual causes of\nfallacies. The former are aspects of human nature such as biases and\nindifference to truth which incline us to make intellectual mistakes.\nThese dispositions are not themselves fallacies. It is the\nintellectual errors, the actual taking of insufficient evidence as\nsufficient, that are fallacious. The various ways in which this can\nhappen are what Mill took as the basis for classifying fallacies.\n\u201cA catalogue of the varieties of evidence which are not real\nevidence,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis an enumeration of\nfallacies\u201d (1891, Bk.V iii \u00a71).\n\nMill divided the broad category of argument fallacies into two groups:\nthose in which the evidence is distinctly conceived and those in which\nit is indistinctly conceived. Fallacies falling under evidence\nindistinctly conceived (Bk. V, vii) were further described as\nfallacies of confusion. These result from an indistinct conception of\nthe evidence leading to a mistaking of its significance and thereby to\nan unsupported conclusion. Some of the traditional Aristotelian\nfallacies such as ambiguity, composition and division, petitio\nprincipii, and ignoratio elenchi, are placed in this\ncategory. Although Mill followed Whately closely in his exposition of\nthe fallacies of confusion, he does not mention any\nad-arguments in connection with ignoratio\nelenchi.\n\nAs for the category of fallacies of evidence distinctly conceived, it\ntoo is divided. The two sub-classes are fallacies of ratiocination\n(deduction) and fallacies of induction. The deductive fallacies (Bk.V,\nvi) are those that explicitly break a rule of the syllogism, such as\nthe three-term rule. But also included are the conversion of universal\naffirmatives and particular negatives (\u201cAll PS\u201d does not\nfollow from \u201cAll SP,\u201d and \u201cSome P not S\u201d does\nnot follow from \u201cSome S not P\u201d). Also included in this\ncategory is the secundum quid fallacy.\n\nThe other sub-class of fallacies distinctly conceived bring out what\nis distinctive about Mill\u2019s work on the fallacies: that it is\nthe first extensive attempt to deal with fallacies of induction. He\ndivided inductive fallacies into two further groups: fallacies of\nobservation (V, iv) and fallacies of generalization (Bk. V, v).\nFallacies of observation can occur either negatively or positively.\nTheir negative occurrence consists in non-observation in which one has\noverlooked negatively relevant evidence. This is similar to what the\nPort-Royal Logic considered a faulty enumeration, and one of\nMill\u2019s examples is the continued faith that farmers put in the\nweather forecasts found in almanacs despite their long history of\nfalse predictions. Observation fallacies occur positively when the\nmistake is based on something that is seen wrongly, i.e., taken to be\nsomething that it is not. Such mal-observations occur when we mistake\nour inferences for facts, as in our inference that the sun rises and\nsets (Bk. V, iv, 5).\n\nFallacies of generalization, the other branch of inductive fallacies,\nresult from mistakes in the inductive process which can happen in\nseveral ways. As one example, Mill pointed to making generalizations\nabout what lies beyond our experience: we cannot infer that the laws\nthat operate in remote parts of the universe are the same as those in\nour solar system (Bk. V, v, 2). Another example is mistaking empirical\nlaws stating regularities for causal laws\u2014his example was\nbecause women as a class have not hitherto equalled men as a class,\nthey will never be able to do so (Bk. V, v, 4). Also placed in the\ncategory of fallacies of generalization is post hoc ergo propter\nhoc, which tends to single out a single cause when there are in\nreality many contributing causes (Bk. V, v, 5). Analogical arguments\nare identified as a false basis for generalizations; they are\n\u201cat best only admissible as an inconclusive presumption, where\nreal proof is unattainable\u201d (Bk. V, v, 6).\n\nMill also included what he calls fallacies of inspection, or a\npriori fallacies (Bk. V, iii) in his survey of fallacies. These\nconsist of non-inferentially held beliefs, so they fit the belief\nconception of fallacies rather than the argument conception. Among\nMill\u2019s examples of a priori fallacies are metaphysical\nassumptions such as that distinctions of language correspond to\ndistinctions in nature, and that objects cannot affect each other at a\ndistance. Even the belief in souls or ghosts is considered an a\npriori fallacy. Such beliefs will not withstand scrutiny, thought\nMill, by the inductive method strictly applied.\n\nA System of Logic is the most extensive work on fallacies\nsince Aristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations. Mill\u2019s\nexamples are taken from a wide range of examples in science, politics,\neconomics, religion and philosophy. His classificatory scheme is\noriginal and comprehensive. Frederick Rosen (2006) argues that\nMill\u2019s pre-occupation with the detection and prevention of\nfallacies is part of what motivates the celebrated second chapter of\nOn Liberty. Despite these considerations, the Logic\nis not much referenced by fallacy theorists.\n2.9 Copi\n\nIrving Copi\u2019s Introduction to Logic\u2014an\ninfluential text book from the mid-twentieth century\u2014defines a\nfallacy as \u201ca form of argument that seems to be correct but\nwhich proves, upon examination, not to be so.\u201d (1961, 52) The\nterm \u2018correct\u2019 is sufficiently broad to allow for both\ndeductive invalidity, inductive weakness, as well as some other kinds\nof argument failure. Of the eighteen informal fallacies Copi\ndiscusses, eleven can be traced back to the Aristotelian tradition,\nand the other seven to the burgeoning post-Lockean ad-fallacy\ntradition.\n\nThe first division in Copi\u2019s classification is between formal\nand informal fallacies. Formal fallacies are invalid inferences which\n\u201cbear a superficial resemblance\u201d to valid forms of\ninference, so these we may think of as deductive fallacies. They\ninclude affirming the consequent, denying the antecedent, the fallacy\nof four terms, undistributed middle, and illicit major. Informal\nfallacies are not characterized as resembling formally valid\narguments; they gain their allure some other way. One division of\ninformal fallacies is the fallacies of relevance which are\n\u201cerrors in reasoning into which we may fall because of\ncarelessness and inattention to our subject matter\u201d (1961, 53).\nThis large class of fallacies includes accident, converse accident,\nfalse cause, petitio principii, complex question,\nignoratio elenchi, ad baculum, ad hominem\nabusive, ad hominem circumstantial, ad ignorantiam,\nad misericordiam, ad populum, and ad\nverecundiam. The other division of informal fallacies is called\nfallacies of ambiguity and it includes equivocation, amphiboly,\naccent, composition and division.\n\nIt seems that Copi took Whately\u2019s category of semi-logical\nfallacies and moved them under a new heading of \u2018informal\nfallacies,\u2019 presumably for the reason that extra-logical\nknowledge is needed to uncover their invalidity. This has the result\nthat the new wide category of informal fallacies is a mixed bag: some\nof them are at bottom logical failures (equivocation, composition,\nad misericordiam) and some are logically correct but\nfrustrate proof (begging the question, ignoratio\n elenchi).[5]\n Copi\u2019s classification, unlike Whately\u2019s which sought to\nmake a distinction on logical grounds, may be seen as based on three\nways that fallacies resemble good arguments: formal fallacies have\ninvalid forms that resemble valid forms, fallacies of ambiguity\nresemble good arguments through the ambiguity of terms, and fallacies\nof relevance exploit psychological (non-logical) associations. Hence,\nwe may think of Copi\u2019s divisions as between logical, semantic\nand psychological fallacies.\n\nCopi\u2019s treatment of the fallacies is a fair overview of the\ntraditional list of fallacies, albeit he did not pretend to do any\nmore than give an introduction to existing fallacy-lore for beginning\nlogic students. Hamblin (1970, ch. 1) criticized Copi\u2019s work,\nalong with that of several others, and gave it the pejorative name,\n\u201cthe standard treatment of fallacies.\u201d His criticisms rang\ntrue with many of his readers, thereby provoking contempt for the\ntraditional treatment of fallacies as well as stimulating research in\nwhat we may call the new, or post-Hamblin, era, of fallacy studies.\nLet us next consider some of these developments.\n3. New approaches to fallacies\n3.1 Renewed interest\n\nA common complaint since Whately\u2019s Elements of Logic is\nthat our theory and teaching of fallacies are in want of\nimprovement\u2014he thought they should be put on a more logical\nfooting to overcome the loose and vague treatments others had\nproffered.\n\nIt is on Logical principles therefore that I propose to discuss the\nsubject of Fallacies. \u2026 the generality of Logical writers have\nusually followed so opposite a plan. Whenever they have to treat of\nanything that is beyond the mere elements of Logic, they totally lay\naside all reference to the principles they have been occupied in\nestablishing and explaining, and have recourse to a loose, vague, and\npopular kind of language \u2026 [which is] \u2026 strangely\nincongruous in a professional Logical treatise. (1875, III, intro.)\n\n\nCharles Hamblin\u2019s 1970 book, Fallacies, revives\nWhately\u2019s complaint. We may view Fallacies as the\ndividing line between traditional approaches to the study of fallacies\nand new, contemporary approaches. At the time of its publication it\nwas the first book-length work devoted to fallacies in modern times.\nThe work opens with a critique of the standard treatment of fallacies\nas it was found in mid-twentieth century textbooks; then, in\nsubsequent chapters, it takes a historical turn reviewing\nAristotle\u2019s approach to fallacies and exploring the tradition it\nfostered (as in the previous section of this entry). Other\nhistorically-oriented chapters include one on the Indian tradition,\nand one on formal fallacies. Hamblin\u2019s more positive\ncontributions to fallacy studies are concentrated in the book\u2019s\nlater chapters on the concept of argument, formal dialectics, and\nequivocation.\n\nWhat Hamblin meant by \u201cthe standard treatment of\nfallacies\u201d was:\n\nThe typical or average account as it appears in the typical short\nchapter or appendix of the average modern textbook. And what we find\nin most cases, I think it should be admitted, is as debased, worn-out\nand dogmatic a treatment as could be imagined\u2014incredibly\ntradition bound, yet lacking in logic and in historical sense alike,\nand almost without connection to anything else in modern Logic at all.\n(1970, 12)\n\n\nLet us consider what came before Hamblin as the traditional approach\nto fallacies and what comes after him as new approaches. The new\napproaches (since the 1970\u2019s) show a concern to overcome\nHamblin\u2019s criticisms, and they also vie with each to produce the\nmost defensible alternative to the traditional approach. One thing\nthat nearly all the new approaches have in common is that they reject\nwhat Hamblin presents as the nearly universally accepted definition of\n\u201cfallacy\u201d as an argument \u201cthat seems to be\nvalid but is not so\u201d (1970, 12). Although this\ndefinition of fallacy is not nearly as widely accepted as Hamblin\nintimated (see Hansen 2002), others have taken to calling it\n\u201cthe standard definition of fallacies\u201d and for convenience\nwe can refer to it as SDF. SDF has three necessary conditions: a\nfallacy (i) is an argument, (ii) that is invalid, and (iii) appears to\nbe valid. These can be thought of as the argument condition, the\ninvalidity condition and the appearance condition. All three\nconditions have been brought into question.\n3.2 Doubts about fallacies\n\nMaurice Finocchiaro continued Hamblin\u2019s criticism of the modern\ntextbook treatment of fallacies, observing that they contain very few\nexamples of actual fallacies, leading him to doubt the validity of\n\u2018fallacy\u2019 as a genuine logical category. Although he\nallows that errors in reasoning are common in real life, he thinks\nthat \u201ctypes of logically incorrect\narguments\u201d\u2014fallacies\u2014are probably not common (1981,\n113). For that reason Finocchiaro prefers to speak of fallacious\narguments\u2014by which he means arguments in which the\nconclusion fails to follow from the premises\u2014rather than\nfallacies (1987, 133). He further distances himself from SDF\nby not considering the appearance condition.\n\nFinocchiaro distinguishes six ways in which arguments can be\nfallacious. (1) Formal fallaciousness is simply the case\nwhere the conclusion does not follow validly from the premises; this\ntype of error can be demonstrated by producing a suitable analogous\ncounter-example in which the premises are true and the conclusion is\nfalse. (2) Explanatory fallaciousness occurs when a specified\nconclusion follows with no more certainty from the given premises than\ndoes a rival conclusion; it occurs most often in the context of\nproposing explanatory hypotheses. (3) Presuppositional\nfallaciousness occurs in those cases where an argument depends on\na false presupposition; this kind of fallaciousness is demonstrated by\nmaking a sound argument showing the presupposition to be false. (4)\nPositive fallaciousness occurs when the given premises,\ncomplemented by other propositions taken as true, are shown to support\na conclusion inconsistent with the given conclusion. (5)\nSemantical fallaciousness results from the ambiguity of\nterms; the conclusion will follow if the sense given to the term in\nthe premises makes the premises false, but if the other sense is\nascribed to the term, making the premises true, the conclusion does\nnot follow (it becomes an instance of formal fallaciousness). (6)\nFinally, Finocchiaro singles out persuasive fallaciousness,\nin which the conclusion does not follow from the premises because it\nis the same as one of the premises. As a test of completeness of this\nsix-fold division of fallaciousness, Finocchiaro (1987) observes that\nit is adequate to classify all the kinds of errors which Galileo found\nin the arguments of the defenders of the geocentric view of the solar\nsystem.\n\nGerald Massey (1981) has voiced a strong objection to fallacy theory\nand the teaching of fallacies. He argues that there is no theory of\ninvalidity\u2014no systematic way to show that an argument is invalid\nother than to show that it has true premises and a false conclusion\n(1981, 164). Hence, there is an asymmetry between proving arguments\nvalid and proving them invalid: they are valid if they can be shown to\nbe an instance of a valid form, but they are not proved invalid by\nshowing that they are an instance of an invalid form, because both\nvalid and invalid arguments instantiate invalid forms. Thus, showing\nthat a natural language argument is an instance of an invalid form\ndoes not preclude the possibility that it is also an instance of a\nvalid form, and therefore valid. Since upholders of SDF maintain that\nfallacies are invalid arguments, Massey\u2019s asymmetry thesis has\nthe consequence that no argument can be convicted of being a fallacy\non logical\n grounds.[6]\n3.3 The informal logic approach to fallacies\n\nThe informal logic approach to fallacies is taken in Johnson and\nBlair\u2019s Logical Self-Defence, a textbook first\npublished in 1977. It was prompted in part by Hamblin\u2019s\nindictment of the standard treatment and it further develops an\ninitiative taken by Kahane (1971) to develop university courses that\nwere geared to everyday reasoning. Johnson and Blair\u2019s emphasis\nis on arming students to defend themselves against fallacies in\neveryday discourse, and a fundamental innovation is in their\nconception of a good argument. In place of a sound argument\u2014a\ndeductively valid argument with true premises\u2014Johnson and Blair\nposit an alternative ideal of a cogent argument, one whose\npremises are acceptable, relevant to and sufficient for its\nconclusion. Acceptability replaces truth as a premise requirement, and\nthe validity condition is split in to two different conditions,\npremise relevance and premise sufficiency. Acceptability is defined\nrelative to audiences\u2014the ones for whom arguments are\nintended\u2014but the other basic concepts, relevance and\nsufficiency, although illustrated by examples, remain as intuitive,\nundefined concepts (see Tindale, 2007). Premise sufficiency (strength)\nis akin to probability in that it is a matter of degree but Johnson\nand Blair do not pursue giving it numerical expression.\n\nThe three criteria of a cogent argument, individually necessary and\njointly sufficient, lead to a conception of fallacy as \u201cany\nargument that violates one of the criteria of good argument \u2026\nand is committed frequently in argumentative discourse\u201d (1993,\n317\u201318). This shares only one condition with SDF: that a fallacy\nis an argument. (Deductive) validity is replaced with the broader\nconcept sufficiency, and the appearance condition is not included.\nJohnson (1987) argued that the appearance condition makes the\noccurrence of fallacies too subjective since how things appear may\nvary from perceiver to perceiver, and it should therefore be replaced\nby a frequency requirement. To be a fallacy, a mistake must occur with\nsufficient frequency to be worth our attention.\n\nThe adoption of the concept of a cogent argument as an ideal has\nseveral consequences. The category of fallacies with problematic\npremises (reminiscent of Whately\u2019s \u201cpremises unduly\nassumed\u201d) shows a concern with argument evaluation over and\nbeyond logical or inference evaluation, drawing the informal logic\napproach away from purely logical concerns towards an epistemic\nconception of fallacies. Having both sufficiency and relevance as\ncriteria (instead of the single validity criterion) has the benefit of\nallowing the making of nuanced judgments about the level of premise\nsupport: for example, we might say that an argument\u2019s premises,\nalthough insufficient, are nevertheless positively relevant to the\nconclusion. Irrelevant premise fallacies are those with no premise\nsupport at all, whereas insufficient premise fallacies are those in\nwhich there is some support, but not enough of it. The informal\nlogicians\u2019 conception of fallacies is meant to be broader and\nmore suitable to natural language argumentation than would be a\nconception tied only to deductive invalidity.\n\nJohnson and Blair concern themselves exclusively with\ninformal fallacies. Many of the familiar Aristotelian\nfallacies that are part of the standard treatment are missing from\ntheir inventory (e.g., accident, composition and division) and the\nones retained find themselves in new categories: begging the question\nand ambiguity are together under the heading of Problematic Premise;\nappeals to authority and popularity are placed under the heading of\nHasty Conclusion fallacies; ad hominem is among the fallacies\nthat belong in the third category, Fallacies of Irrelevant Reason.\nThis new list of fallacies has a different bent than many earlier\nlists, being more geared to deal with arguments in popular, everyday\ncommunication than philosophical or scientific discourse; this is\nevident both by the omission of some of the traditional fallacies as\nwell as by the introduction of new ones, such as dubious assumption,\ntwo wrongs, slippery slope, and faulty analogy.\n\nThe kinds of mistakes one can make in reasoning are generally thought\nto be beyond enumeration and, hence, it has been maintained that there\ncan be no complete stock of fallacies that will guard against every\nkind of mistake. Johnson and Blair\u2019s approach is responsive to\nthis problem in that it allows the names of the classes of fallacies\n\u2014 \u2018unacceptable premise,\u2019 \u2018irrelevant\nreason\u2019 and \u2018hasty conclusion\u2019 \u2014 to stand for\nfallacies themselves, fallacies broad-in-scope; i.e., to serve\n\u201cboth as general principles of organization, and as back-ups to\nfill in any gaps between specific labels belonging within each\ngenus\u201d (1993, 52). Hence, any violation of one of the criteria\nof a cogent argument can be considered a fallacy.\n\nIn addition to this alternative theoretical approach to fallacies\nbuilt on the three criteria of a cogent argument\u2014an approach\nalso taken up by\n others[7]\u2014informal\n logic\u2019s contribution to fallacy studies lies in its attempts to\nprovide better analyses of fallacies, a programme pursued by a large\nnumber of researchers, including Govier (1982) on the slippery slope,\nWreen (1989) on the ad baculum, Walton (1991) on begging the\nquestion, Brinton (1995) on the ad hominem, Freeman (1995) on\nthe appeal to popularity, and Pinto (1995) on post hoc ergo\npropter hoc.\n3.4 The formal approach to informal fallacies\n\nJohn Woods also despairs of the standard treatment but he sees in it\nsomething of importance; namely that the fallacies most often reviewed\nin introductory level logic textbooks \u201care a kind of caricature\nof their associated improprieties, which lie deeply imbedded in human\npractice\u201d (Woods 1992, 25). The fallacies are then behavioural\nsymptoms of kinds of irrationality to which humans are highly\nsusceptible, and that makes them an important subject for study\nbecause they say something about human nature. Therefore, the problem\nwith the standard treatment, according to Woods, is not that it is a\nmisdirected research programme, but rather that it has been poorly\ncarried out, partly because logicians have failed to appreciate that a\nmulti-logical approach is necessary to understand the variety of\nfallacies. This idea, pursued jointly by Woods and Douglas Walton\n(1989), is that, for many of the fallacies standard formal logic is\ninadequate to uncover the unique kind of logical mistakes in\nquestion\u2014it is too coarse conceptually to reveal the unique\ncharacter of many of the fallacies. To get a satisfactory analysis of\neach of the fallacies they must be matched with a fitting logical\nsystem, one that has the facility to uncover the particular logical\nweakness in question. Inductive logic can be employed for analysis of\nhasty generalization and post hoc ergo propter hoc;\nrelatedness logic is appropriate for ignoratio elenchi;\nplausible reasoning theory for the ad verecundiam, and\ndialectical game theory for begging the question and many questions.\nWoods (1992, 43) refers to this approach to studying the fallacies as\nmethodological pluralism. Thus, like the informal logicians, there is\nhere an interest in getting the analyses of each of the fallacies\nright, but the Woods and Walton approach involves embracing formal\nmethods, not putting them aside.\n\nWoods (2013) has continued his research on fallacies, most recently\nconsidering them in the context of what he calls a naturalized logic\n(modelled on Quine\u2019s naturalized epistemology). The main point\nof this naturalizing move is that a theory of reasoning should take\ninto account the abilities and motivations of reasoners. Past work on\nthe fallacies has identified them as failing to satisfy the rules of\neither deductive or inductive logic, but Woods now wants to consider\nthe core fallacies in light of what he calls third-way reasoning\n(comparable to non-monotonic reasoning), an account of the cognitive\npractices that closely resemble our common inferential practices. From\nthe perspective of third-way reasoning the \u201crules\u201d implicit in the\nfallacies present themselves as heuristic directives to reasoners\nrather than as fallacies; hence, it may be that learning from feedback\n(having errors corrected) is less trouble than learning the rules to\navoid fallacies in the first place (Woods 2013, p. 215). Woods\nillustrates his point by recalling many of the fallacies he originally\nidentified in his 1992 paper, and subjecting them to this revised\nmodel of analysis thereby overturning the view that these types of\nargument are always to be spurned.\n3.5 The epistemic approach to fallacies\n\nSDF may be seen as closely tied to the logical approach to\nfallacies\u2014the fault in arguments it singles out is their\ndeductive invalidity. But this conception of fallacies turns out to be\ninadequate to cover the variety of the core fallacies in two ways: it\nis too narrow because it excludes begging the question which is not\ninvalid, and it is too wide because it condemns good but non-deductive\narguments as fallacies (given that they also satisfy the appearance\ncondition) because they are invalid. Even if we replace the invalidity\ncondition in SDF with some less stringent standard of logical weakness\nwhich could overcome the \u201ctoo wide\u201d problem, it would\nstill leave the difficulty of accounting for the fallacy of begging\nthe question unsolved.\n\nSiegel and Biro (1992, 1995) hold an epistemic account of fallacies,\ncontrasting their view with dialectical/rhetorical approaches, because\nmatters extraneous to arguments, such as being a practice that leads\nto false beliefs or not being persuasive, are not in their view a\nsufficient condition to make an argument a fallacy. They take the\nposition that \u201cit is a conceptual truth about arguments that\ntheir central \u2026 purpose is to provide a bridge from known\ntruths or justified beliefs to as yet unknown \u2026 truths or as\nyet unjustified beliefs\u201d (1992, 92). Only arguments that are\n\u201cepistemically serious\u201d can accomplish this; that is, only\narguments that satisfy the extra-formal requirement that premises are\nknowable independently of their conclusions, and are more acceptable\nepistemically than their conclusions, can fulfill this function. A\npurely logical approach to argument will not capture this requirement\nbecause arguments of the same valid form, but with different contents,\nmay or may not be epistemically serious, depending on whether the\npremises are epistemically acceptable relative to the conclusion.\n\nModifying Biro\u2019s (1977, 265\u201366) examples we can\ndemonstrate how the requirement of epistemic seriousness plays out\nwith begging the question. Consider these two arguments:\n\n\nAll men are mortal;\n\nObama is a man;\n\nSo, Obama is mortal.\n\nAll members of the committee are old Etonians;\n\nFortesque is a member of the committee;\n\nFortesque is an old Etonian.\n\n\nIn the first argument the premises are knowable independently of the\nconclusion. The major premise can be deduced from other universal\npremises about animals, and the minor premise, unlike the conclusion\nwhich must be inferred, can be known by observation. Hence, this\nargument does not beg the question. However, in the second argument\n(due to Biro, 1977) given the minor premise, the major cannot be known\nto be true unless the conclusion is known to be true. Consequently, on\nthe epistemic approach to fallacies taken by Biro and Siegel, the\nsecond argument, despite the fact that it is valid, is non-serious, it\nbegs the question, and it is a fallacy. If there was some independent\nway of knowing whether the major premise was true, such as that it was\na bylaw that only old Etonians could be committee members, the\nargument would be a serious one, and not beg the question.\n\nBiro and Siegel\u2019s epistemic account of fallacies is\ndistinguishable in at least three ways. First, it insists that the\nfunction of arguments is epistemic, and therefore anything that counts\nas a fallacy must be an epistemic fault, a breaking of a rule of\nepistemic justification. But since logical faults are also epistemic\nfaults, the epistemic approach to fallacies will include logical\nfallacies, although these must also be explicable in terms of\nepistemic seriousness. Second, since the epistemological approach does\nnot insist that all justification must be deductive, it allows the\npossibility of their being fallacies (as well as good arguments) by\nnon-deductive standards, something precluded by SDF. Finally, we\nnotice that the appearance condition is not considered a factor in\nthis discussion of fallacies.\n\nUlrike Hahn and Mike Oaksford (2006a, 2006b) see themselves as\ncontributing to the epistemic approach to fallacy analysis by\ndeveloping a probabilistic analysis of the fallacies. It is part of\ntheir programme for a normative theory of natural language\nargumentation. They are motivated by what they perceive as the\nshortcomings in other approaches. The logical (deductive) approach\nfalls short in that it simply divides arguments into valid and invalid\narguments thereby failing to appreciate that natural language\narguments come in various degrees of strength. The alternative\napproaches to fallacies, given by procedural (dialectical) and\nconsensual accounts, they criticize on the basis that they fail to\naddress the central problem raised by the fallacies: that of the\nstrength of the reason-claim complex. In Hahn and Oaksford\u2019s\nview the strength or weakness of the classical fallacies (they are\nconcerned mostly with the post-Aristotelian ones) is not a result of\ntheir structure or their context of use. It is instead a matter of the\nrelationship between the evidence and the claim (the contents of the\npremises and the conclusion). Evaluation of this relationship is\nthought to be best captured by a probabilistic Bayesian account;\naccordingly, they adapt Bayes\u2019 theorem to arguments evaluation\nwith the proviso that the probabilities are subjective degrees of\nbelief, not frequencies. \u201cAn argument\u2019s strength,\u201d\nthey write, \u201cis a function of an individual\u2019s initial\nlevel of belief in the claim, the availability and observation of\nconfirmatory (or disconfirmatory) evidence, and the existence and\nperceived strength of competing hypotheses\u201d (Corner, et al.\n1145). With Korb (2003) they view a fallacy as an argument with a low\nprobability on the Bayesian model.\n\nSince the variance in input probabilities will result in a range of\noutputs in argument strength, this probabilistic approach has the\npotential to assign argument strengths anywhere between 0 and 1,\nthereby allowing that different tokens of one argument type can vary\ngreatly in strength, i.e., some will be fallacies and others not.\nAlso, and this seems to concur with our experience, different arguers\nmay disagree on the strength of the same arguments since they can\ndiffer in the assignments of the initial probabilities. Hahn and\nOaksford also claim as advantages for their normative theory that it\ngives guidance for persuasion since it takes into account the initial\nbeliefs of audiences. Moreover, their approach contributes to the\nstudy of belief change; that is, to what extent our confidence in the\nconclusion changes with the availability of new evidence. \n3.6 Dialectical/dialogical approaches to fallacies\n\nSome of the most active new researchers on fallacies take a\ndialectical and/or dialogical approach. This can be traced back to\nHamblin (1970, ch. 8) and Lorenzen\u2019s (1969) dialogue theory. The\npanacea for fallacies that Whately recommended was more logic;\nHamblin, however, proposed a shift from the logical to the dialectical\nperspective.\n\n[W]e need to extend the bounds of Formal Logic; to include features of\ndialectical contexts within which arguments are put forward. To begin\nwith, there are criteria of validity of argument that are additional\nto formal ones: for example, those that serve to proscribe\nquestion-begging. To go on with, there are prevalent but false\nconceptions of the rules of dialogue, which are capable of making\ncertain argumentative moves seem satisfactory and unobjectionable\nwhen, in fact, they conceal and facilitate dialectical malpractice.\n(Hamblin 1970, 254)\n\n\nThe proposal here is to shift the study of fallacies from the contexts\nof arguments to the contexts of dialogues (argumentation), formulate\nrules for reasonable dialogue activity, and then connect fallacies to\nfailures of rule-following. Barth and Martens\u2019s paper (1977),\nwhich studied the argumentum ad hominem by extending\nLorenzen\u2019s dialogue tableaux method to include the definitions\nof the concepts \u201cline of attack\u201d and \u201cwinning\nstrategy,\u201d leads to a conception of fallacies as either failures\nto meet one of the necessary conditions of rational dialogical\nargumentation, or failures to satisfy sufficient conditions as\nspecified by production rules of the dialogical method (1977, 96).\n\nThe Barth and Martens paper is a bridge between the earlier (quasi-)\nformal and subsequent informal dialectical theories, and is explicitly\nacknowledged as a major influence by the Pragma-dialectical theory,\nthe brainchild of Frans van Eemeren and Rob Grootendorst (1984).\nRather than beginning from a logical or epistemological perspective\nthey start with the role of argumentation in overcoming interpersonal\ndisagreements. The Pragma-dialecticians propose that inter-personal\nargumentation can be analysed as two-party-discussions having four\nanalytical stages: a confrontation stage in which the participants\nbecome aware of the content of their disagreement; an opening stage in\nwhich the parties agree (most likely implicitly) to shared starting\npoints and a set of rules to govern the ensuing discussion; an\nargumentation stage wherein arguments and doubts about arguments are\nexpressed and recognized; and a final stage in which a decision about\nthe initial disagreement is made, if possible, based on what happened\nin the argumentation stage.\n\nThe Pragma-dialectical theory stipulates a normative ideal of a\ncritical discussion which serves both as a guide to the\nreconstruction of natural language argumentation, as well as a\nstandard for the evaluation of the analysed product of reconstruction.\nA set of ten rules has been proposed as constitutive of the\ncritical-discussion ideal, and the proponents of the theory believe\nthat rational arguers would accept them. If followed by both parties\nto the disagreement, the rules constrain the argumentation decision\nprocedure such that any resolution reached will be deemed reasonable,\nand \u201cevery violation of any of the rules of the discussion\nprocedure for conducting a critical discussion\u201d will be a\nfallacy (2004, 175). The rules range over all the four stages of\nargumentation: at the confrontation stage there is a rule which says\none may not prevent the other party from expressing their view; for\nthe argumentation stage there is a rule which requires argumentation\nto be logically strong and in accord with one or another of three\ngeneral argumentation schemes; at the closing stage there is a rule\nthat the participants themselves are to decide which party was\nsuccessful based on the quality of the argumentation they have made:\nif the proponent carries the day, the opponent should acknowledge it,\nand vice versa.\n\nThe Pragma-dialectical theory proposes that each of the core fallacies\ncan be assigned a place as a violation of one of the rules of a\ncritical discussion. For example, the ad baculum fallacy is a\nform of intimidation that violates the rule that one may not attempt\nto prevent one\u2019s discussion partner from expressing their views;\nequivocation is a violation of the rule that formulations in arguments\nmust be clear and unambiguous; post hoc ergo propter hoc\nviolates the rule that arguments must be instances of schemes\ncorrectly applied. Moreover, on this theory, since any rule violation\nis to count as a fallacy this allows for the possibility that there\nmay be hitherto unrecognized \u201cnew fallacies.\u201d Among those\nproposed are declaring a standpoint sacrosanct because that\nbreaks the rule against the freedom to criticize points of view, and\nevading the burden of proof which breaks the rule that you\nmust defend your standpoint if asked to do so (see van Eemeren 2010,\n194).\n\nClearly not all the rules of critical discussions apply directly to\narguments. Some govern other goal-frustrating moves which arguers can\nmake in the course of settling a difference of opinion, such as\nmis-allocating the burden of proof, asking irrelevant questions,\nsuppressing a point of view, or failing to clarify the meaning of\none\u2019s argumentation. In short, the Pragma-dialectical rules of a\ncritical discussion are not just rules of logic or epistemology, but\nrules of conduct for rational discussants, making the theory more like\na moral code than a set of logical principles. Accordingly, this\napproach to fallacies rejects all three of the necessary conditions of\nSDF: a fallacy need not be an argument, thus the invalidity condition\nwill not apply either, and the appearance condition is excluded\nbecause of its subjective character (Van Eemeren and Grootendorst\n2004, 175).\n\nThe Pragma-dialectical analysis of fallacies as rule-breakings in a\nprocedure for overcoming disagreements has recently been expanded to\ntake account of the rhetorical dimension of argumentation.\nPragma-dialectics takes the rhetorical dimension to stem from an\narguer\u2019s wish to have their view accepted which leads dialoguers\nto engage in strategic maneuvering vis-\u00e0-vis their dialogue\npartners. However, this desire must be put in balance with the\ndialectical requirement of being reasonable; that is, staying within\nthe bounds of the normative demands of critical discussions. The ways\nof strategic maneuvering identified are basically three: topic\nselection, audience orientation, and the selection of presentational\ndevices, and these can be effectively deployed at each stage of\nargumentation (Van Eemeren 2010, 94). \u201cAll derailments of\nstrategic maneuvering are fallacies,\u201d writes van Eemeren (2010,\n198), \u201cin the sense that they violate one or more of the rules\nfor critical discussion and all fallacies can be viewed as derailments\nof strategic maneuvering.\u201d This means that all fallacies are\nultimately attributable to the rhetorical dimension of argumentation\nsince, in this model, strategic maneuvering is the entry of rhetoric\ninto argumentation discussions. \u201cBecause each fallacy has, in\nprinciple, sound counterparts that are manifestations of the same mode\nof strategic maneuvering\u201d it may not appear to be a fallacy and\nit \u201cmay pass unnoticed\u201d (Van Eemeren 2010, 199).\nNevertheless, Pragma-dialectics prefers to keep the appearance\ncondition outside the definition of \u2018fallacy\u2019, treating\nthe seeming goodness of fallacies as a sometime co-incidental\nproperty, rather than an essential one.\n\nArgumentation evaluation on the Pragma-dialectical approach is done\nwith an eye to a single ideal model of argumentation. This approach\nhas been challenged by Douglas Walton who has written more about\nfallacies and fallacy theory than anyone else. He has published\nindividual monographs on many of the well-known fallacies, among them,\nBegging the Question (1991), Slippery Slope\nArguments (1992), Ad Hominem Arguments (1998), and a\ncomprehensive work on fallacy theory, A Pragmatic Theory of\nFallacy (1995). Over the years his views have evolved. He has\nreferred to his theory as \u201cthe Pragmatic theory,\u201d and like\nthe Pragma-dialectical theory it has a dialectical/dialogical basis;\nhowever, Walton envisions a number of distinct normative dialectical\nframeworks (persuasion dialogue, inquiry dialogue, negotiation\ndialogue, etc.) rather than the single model of a critical discussion\nproposed by Pragma-dialectics. Postulating different kinds of\ndialogues with different starting points and different goals, thinks\nWalton, will bring argumentation into closer contact with\nargumentation reality. At one point Walton had the idea that fallacies\nhappened when there was an illicit shift from one kind of a dialogue\nto another (1995, 118\u201323), for example, using arguments\nappropriate for a negotiation dialogue in a persuasion dialogue, but\nmore recently he has turned to other ways of explicating\nfallacies.\n\nAlthough Walton recognizes the class of formal fallacies, his main\ninterest is in informal fallacies, especially the ones associated with\nargumentation schemes. The idea of an argumentation scheme is central\nto Walton\u2019s theory. Schemes are patterns of commonly used kinds\nof defeasible reasoning/argumentation such as appeals to expert\nopinion and ad hominem arguments. Schemes do not identify\nfallacies but rather argument kinds that are sometimes used fairly,\nand, other times, fallaciously. With each kind of scheme is associated\na set of critical questions which guide us in deciding whether a given\nuse of an argument is correct, weak or fallacious. So, if we\nconsider:\n\n\\(E\\) is an expert in subject area \\(S\\);\n\n\\(E\\) asserts \\(p\\) based on \\(E\\)\u2019s knowledge of \\(S\\);\n\nSo, \\(p\\).\n\nto be the scheme for the appeal-to-expertise kind of\n argument,[8]\n then there will be a question for each premise: Is \\(E\\) really an\nexpert in \\(S\\)? Did \\(E\\) say \\(p\\) when s/he was acting in her/his\nprofessional capacity? (\u2026 or did s/he blurt it out while drunk\nat an association party?). If the answer to both questions is Yes,\nthen the argument creates a presumption for the conclusion\u2014but\nnot a guarantee, for the reasoning is defeasible: other information\nmay come to light that will override the presumption. If one of the\nquestions cannot be answered clearly this is an indication that the\nargument is weak, and answering No to either of the two questions\ncancels the presumption for the conclusion, i.e., makes the argument\ninto a bad argument from expert opinion. If the bad argument has\n\u201ca semblance of correctness about it in [the] context, and poses\na serious obstacle to the realization of the goal of the\ndialog,\u201d then it is a fallacy (2011,\n 380).[9]\n\nThe definition of fallacy Walton proposes (1995, 255) has five parts.\nA fallacy:\n\nan argument (or at least something that purports to be an\nargument) that\nfalls short of some standard of correctness;\nis used in a context of dialogue;\nhas a semblance of correctness about it; and\nposes a serious problem to the realization of the goal of the\ndialogue.\n\n\nHere we find that Walton has relaxed two of the necessary conditions\nof SDF. Purporting to be an argument is enough (it doesn\u2019t\nreally have to be an argument), while falling short of a standard (one\nthat will vary with the kind of dialogue under consideration) replaces\nthe invalidity condition. However, the appearance condition, here\nexpressed as fallacies having a semblance of correctness about them,\nremains in full force. The two extra conditions added to fallacy are\nthat they occur only in contexts of dialogue and that they frustrate\nthe realization of the goal of the kind of dialogue in which they\noccur. In insisting on this dialogical dimension, Walton is in full\nsympathy with those who think that fallacies can only be rightly\nanalysed within a dialectical framework similar to the ones Aristotle\noriginally studied, and later better defined by Hamblin and Lorenzen.\nWalton volunteers a shorter version of the definition of a fallacy as\n\u201ca deceptively bad argument that impedes the progress of a\ndialogue\u201d (1995, 256).\n\nWalton divides fallacies into two kinds: paralogisms and sophisms. A\nparalogism is \u201cthe type of fallacy in which an error of\nreasoning is typically committed by failing to meet some necessary\nrequirement of an argumentation scheme\u201d whereas \u201cthe\nsophism type of fallacy is a sophistical tactic used to try to\nunfairly get the best of a speech partner in an exchange of\narguments\u201d (2010, 171; see also 1995, 254). Paralogisms are\ninstances of identifiable argumentation schemes, but sophisms are not.\nThe latter are associated more with infringing a reasonable\nexpectation of dialogue than with failing some standard of argument,\n(2011, 385; 2010, 175). A further distinction is drawn between\narguments used intentionally to deceive and arguments that merely\nbreak a maxim of argumentation unintentionally. The former count as\nfallacies; the latter, less condemnable, are blunders (1995, 235).\n\nAmong the informal paralogisms Walton includes: ad hominem,\nad populum, ad misericordiam, ad\nignorantiam, ad verecundiam, slippery slope, false\ncause, straw man, argument from consequences, faulty analogy,\ncomposition and division. In the category of sophisms he places ad\nbaculum, complex question, begging the question, hasty\ngeneralization, ignoratio elenchi, equivocation, amphiboly,\naccent, and secundum quid. He also has a class of formal\nfallacies very much the same as those identified by Whately and Copi.\nThe largest class in Walton\u2019s classification is the one\nassociated with argumentation schemes and ad-arguments, and\nthese are the ones that he considers to be the most central fallacies.\nNearly all the Aristotelian fallacies included find themselves\nrelegated to the less studied categories of sophisms. Taking a long\nlook at the history of fallacies, then, we find that the Aristotelian\nfallacies are no longer of central importance. They have been replaced\nby the fallacies associated with the ad-arguments.\n\nAnother recent approach comes from virtue argumentation theory\n(modelled on virtue epistemology). Virtue argumentation theory is\ncharacterized by a distinct set of virtues thought to be essential to\ngood argumentation: willingness to engage in argumentation,\nwillingness to listen to others and willingness to modify one\u2019s\nown position (see, e.g., Cohen 2009). These may be supplemented with\nepistemic virtues and even in some cases moral virtues. Although\nvirtues and vices are dispositions of arguers and fallacies are\narguments, it is claimed that good argumentation generally results\nfrom the influence of argumentation virtues and bad argumentation\n(including the fallacies) arise because of the vices of arguers. \n\nTaking the Aristotelian view that virtues are a mean between opposite\nkinds of vices, fallacious arguments can be seen as resulting from\narguers moving in one or another direction away from a mean of good\nargumentation. Aberdein (2013, 2016) especially has developed this\nmodel for understanding many of the fallacies. We can illustrate the\nview by considering appeals to expertise: the associated vices might\nbe too little respect for reliable authorities at one extreme and too\nmuch deference to authorities at the other extreme. Aberdein develops\nthe fallacies-as-argumentation-vices analysis in some detail for other\nof the ad-arguments and sketches how it might be applied to the other\ncore fallacies, suggesting it can profitably be extended to all of\nthem. \n\nAll the fallacies, it is claimed, can be fitted in somewhere in the\nclassification of argumentational vices, but the converse is not true\nalthough it is possible to bring to light other shortcomings to which\nwe may fall prey in argumentation. Another aspect of the theory is\nthat it distributes argumentation vices among both senders and\naudiences. Speakers may infect their arguments with vices when they\nare, for example, closed minded or lack respect for persons, and\naudiences can contribute to fallaciousness by letting their\nreceptivity be influenced by na\u00efvety, an over-reliance on common\nsense, or an unfounded bias against a speaker. Perhaps the development\nof the virtue argumentation theory approach to fallacies provides a\nsupplement to Mill\u2019s theory of fallacies. He distinguished\n(1891, V, i, 3) what he called the moral (dispositional) and\nintellectual causes of fallacy. The study of the argumentative vices\nenvisioned above seems best included under the moral study of\nfallacies as the vices can be taken to be the presdisposing causes to\ncommit intellectual mistakes, i.e., misevaluations of the weight of\nevidence. \n4. Current issues in fallacy theory\n4.1 The nature of fallacies\n\nA question that continues to dog fallacy theory is how we are to\nconceive of fallacies. There would be advantages to having a unified\ntheory of fallacies. It would give us a systematic way of demarcating\nfallacies and other kinds of mistakes; it would give us a framework\nfor justifying fallacy judgments, and it would give us a sense of the\nplace of fallacies in our larger conceptual schemes. Some general\ndefinition of \u2018fallacy\u2019 is wanted but the desire is\nfrustrated because there is disagreement about the identity of\nfallacies. Are they inferential, logical, epistemic or dialectical\nmistakes? Some authors insist that they are all of one kind: Biro and\nSiegel, for example, that they are epistemic, and Pragma-dialectics\nthat they are dialectical. There are reasons to think that all\nfallacies do not easily fit into one category.\n\nTogether the Sophistical Refutations and Locke\u2019s\nEssay are the dual sources of our inheritance of fallacies.\nHowever, for four reasons they make for uneasy bedfellows. First, the\nad fallacies seem to have a built-in dialectical character,\nwhich, it can be argued, Aristotle\u2019s fallacies do not have (they\nare not sophistical refutations but are in sophistical\nrefutations). Second, Aristotle\u2019s fallacies are logical\nmistakes: they have no appropriate employment outside eristic\nargumentation whereas the ad-fallacies are instances of\nad-arguments, often appropriately used in dialogues. Third,\nthe appearance condition is part of the Aristotelian inheritance but\nit is not intimately connected with the ad-fallacies\ntradition. A fourth reason that contributes to the tension between the\nAristotelian and Lockean traditions in fallacies is that the former\ngrew out of philosophical problems, largely what are logical and\nmetaphysical puzzles (consider the many examples in Sophistical\nRefutations), whereas the ad-fallacies are more geared\nto social and political topics of popular concern, the subject matter\nthat most intrigues modern researchers on fallacy theory.\n\nAs we look back over our survey we cannot help but observe that\nfallacies have been identified in relation to some ideal or model of\ngood arguments, good argumentation, or rationality. Aristotle\u2019s\nfallacies are shortcomings of his ideal of deduction and proof,\nextended to contexts of refutation. The fallacies listed by Mill are\nerrors of reasoning in a comprehensive model that includes both\ndeduction and induction. Those who have defended SDF as the correct\ndefinition of\n \u2018fallacy\u2019[10]\n take logic simpliciter or deductive validity as the ideal of\nrationality. Informal logicians view fallacies as failures to satisfy\nthe criteria of what they consider to be a cogent argument. Defenders\nof the epistemic approach to fallacies see them as shortfalls of the\nstandards of knowledge-generating arguments. Finally, those who are\nconcerned with how we are to overcome our disagreements in a\nreasonable way will see fallacies as failures in relation to ideals of\ndebate or critical discussions.\n\nThe standard treatment of the core fallacies has not emerged from a\nsingle conception of good argument or reasonableness but rather, like\nmuch of our unsystematic knowledge, has grown as a hodgepodge\ncollection of items, proposed at various time and from different\nperspectives, that continues to draw our attention, even as the\nstandards that originally brought a given fallacy to light are\nabandoned or absorbed into newer models of rationality. Hence, there\nis no single conception of good argument or argumentation to be\ndiscovered behind the core fallacies, and any attempt to force them\nall into a single framework, must take efforts to avoid distorting the\ncharacter originally attributed to each of them.\n4.2 The appearance condition\n\nFrom Aristotle to Mill the appearance condition was an essential part\nof the conception of fallacies. However, some of the new,\npost-Hamblin, scholars have either ignored it (Finocchiaro, Biro and\nSiegel) or rejected it because appearances can vary from person to\nperson, thus making the same argument a fallacy for the one who is\ntaken in by the appearance, and not a fallacy for the one who sees\npast the appearances. This is unsatisfactory for those who think that\narguments are either fallacies or not. Appearances, it is also argued,\nhave no place in logical or scientific theories because they belong to\npsychology (van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 2004). But Walton (e.g.,\n2010) continues to consider appearances an essential part of fallacies\nas does Powers (1995, 300) who insists that fallacies must \u201chave\nan appearance, however quickly seen through, of being valid.\u201d If\nthe mistake in an argument is not masked by an ambiguity that makes it\nappear to be a better argument than it really is, Powers denies it is\na fallacy.\n\nThe appearance condition of fallacies serves at least two purposes.\nFirst, it can be part of explanations of why reasonable people make\nmistakes in arguments or argumentation: it may be due in part to an\nargument\u2019s appearing to be better than it really is. Second, it\nserves to divide mistakes into two groups: those which are trivial or\nthe result of carelessness (for which there is no cure other than\npaying better attention), and those which we need to learn to detect\nthrough an increased awareness of their seductive nature. Without the\nappearance condition, it can be argued, no division can be made\nbetween these two kinds of errors: either there are no fallacies or\nall mistakes in argument and/or argumentation are fallacies; a\nconclusion that some are willing to accept, but which runs contrary to\ntradition. One can also respond that there is an alternative to using\nthe appearance condition as the demarcation property between fallacies\nand casual mistakes, namely, frequency. Fallacies are those mistakes\nwe must learn to guard against because they occur with noticeable\nfrequency. To this it may be answered that \u2018noticeable\nfrequency\u2019 is vague, and is perhaps best explained by the\nappearance condition.\n4.3 Teaching\n\nOn the more practical level, there continues to be discussion about\nthe value of teaching the fallacies to students. Is it an effective\nway for them to learn to reason well and to avoid bad arguments? One\nreason to think that it is not effective is that the list of fallacies\nis not complete, and that even if the group of core fallacies was\nextended to incorporate other fallacies we thought worth including, we\ncould still not be sure that we had a complete prophylactic against\nbad arguments. Hence, we are better off teaching the positive criteria\nfor good arguments/ argumentation which give us a fuller set of\nguidelines for good reasoning. But some (Pragma-dialectics and Johnson\nand Blair) do think that their stock of fallacies is a complete guard\nagainst errors because they have specified a full set of necessary\nconditions for good arguments/argumentation and they hold that\nfallacies are just failures to meet one of these conditions.\n\nAnother consideration about the value of the fallacies approach to\nteaching good reasoning is that it tends to make students overly\ncritical and lead them to see fallacies where there are not any;\nhence, it is maintained we could better advance the instilling of\ncritical thinking skills by teaching the positive criteria of good\nreasoning and arguments (Hitchcock, 1995). In response to this view,\nit is argued that, if the fallacies are taught in a non-perfunctory\nway which includes the explanations of why they are\nfallacies\u2014which normative standards they transgress\u2014then a\ncourse taught around the core fallacies can be effective in instilling\ngood reasoning skills (Blair 1995).\n4.4 Biases\n\nRecently there has been renewed interest in how biases are related to\nfallacies. Correia (2011) has taken Mill\u2019s insight that biases\nare predisposing causes of fallacies a step further by connecting\nidentifiable biases with particular fallacies. Biases can influence\nthe unintentional committing of fallacies even where there is no\nintent to be deceptive, he observes. Taking biases to be\n\u201csystematic errors that invariably distort the subject\u2019s\nreasoning and judgment,\u201d the picture drawn is that particular\nbiases are activated by desires and emotions (motivated reasoning) and\nonce they are in play, they negatively affect the fair evaluation of\nevidence. Thus, for example, the \u201cfocussing illusion\u201d bias\ninclines a person to focus on just a part of the evidence available,\nignoring or denying evidence that might lead in another direction.\nCorreia (2011, 118) links this bias to the fallacies of hasty\ngeneralization and straw man, suggesting that it is our desire to be\nright that activates the bias to focus more on positive or negative\nevidence, as the case may be. Other biases he links to other\nfallacies.\n\nThagard (2011) is more concerned to stress the differences between\nfallacies and biases than to find connections between them. He claims\nthat the model of reasoning articulated by informal logic is not a\ngood fit with the way that people actually reason and that only a few\nof the fallacies are relevant to the kinds of mistakes people actually\nmake. Thagard\u2019s argument depends on his distinction between\nargument and inference. Arguments, and fallacies, he takes to be\nserial and linguistic, but inferences are brain activities and are\ncharacterized as parallel and multi-modal. By \u201cparallel\u201d\nis meant that the brain carries out different processes\nsimultaneously, and by \u201cmulti-modal\u201d that the brain uses\nnon-linguistic and emotional, as well as linguistic representations in\ninferring. Biases (inferential error tendencies) can unconsciously\naffect inferring. \u201cMotivated inference,\u201d for example,\n\u201cinvolves selective recruitment and assessment of evidence based\non unconscious processes that are driven by emotional considerations\nof goals rather than purely cognitive reasoning\u201d (2011, 156).\nThagard volunteers a list of more than fifty of these inferential\nerror tendencies. Because motivated inferences result from unconscious\nmental processes rather than explicit reasoning, the errors in\ninferences cannot be exposed simply by identifying a fallacy in a\nreconstructed argument. Dealing with biases requires identification of\nboth conscious and unconscious goals of arguers, goals that can figure\nin explanations of why they incline to particular biases.\n\u201cOvercoming people\u2019s motivated inferences,\u201d Thagard\nconcludes, \u201cis therefore more akin to psychotherapy than\ninformal logic\u201d (157), and the importance of fallacies is\naccordingly marginalized.\n\nIn response to these findings, one can admit their relevance to the\npedagogy of critical thinking but still recall the distinction between\nwhat causes mistakes and what the mistakes are. The analysis of\nfallacies belongs to the normative study of arguments and\nargumentation, and to give an account of what the fallacy in a given\nargument is will involve making reference to some norm of\nargumentation. It will be an explanation of what the mistake in the\nargument is. Biases are relevant to understanding why people commit\nfallacies, and how we are to help them get past them, but they do not\nhelp us understand what the fallacy-mistakes are in the first\nplace\u2014this is not a question of psychology. Continued research\nat this intersection of interests will hopefully shed more light on\nboth biases and fallacies.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aberdein, A., 2013, \u201cFallacy and argumentational\nvice,\u201d <em>Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation</em>\n(OSSA Conference Archive: OSSA 10),\n <a href=\"https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1973&amp;context=ossaarchive\" target=\"other\">available online</a>.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2016, \u201cThe vices of argument,\u201d\n<em>Topoi</em>, 25: 413\u201322.", "Aristotle, <em>Categories</em>, H.P.
