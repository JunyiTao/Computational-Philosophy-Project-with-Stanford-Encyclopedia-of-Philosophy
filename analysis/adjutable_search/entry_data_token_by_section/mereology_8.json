Mereologically, an atom (or \u201csimple\u201d)\nis an entity with no proper parts, regardless of whether it is\npoint-like or has spatial (and/or temporal) extension:\n\n\n(32)\nAtom\n\nAx =df \u00ac\u2203yPPyx.\n\n\n\nBy definition of \u2018PP\u2019, all atoms are pairwise disjoint and\ncan only overlap things of which they are part. Are there any such\nentities? And, if there are, is everything entirely made up of atoms?\nIs everything comprised of at least some atoms? Or is everything made\nup of atomless \u201cgunk\u201d\u2014as Lewis (1991: 20) calls\nit\u2014that divides forever into smaller and smaller parts? These\nare deep and difficult questions, which have been the focus of\nphilosophical investigation since the early days of philosophy and\nthroughout the medieval and modern debate on anti-divisibilism, up to\nKant's antinomies in the Critique of Pure Reason (see the\nentries on\n ancient atomism\n and\n atomism from the 17th to the 20th century).\n Along with nuclear physics, they made their way into contemporary\nmereology mainly through Nicod's (1924) \u201cgeometry of the\nsensible world\u201d, Tarski's (1929) \u201cgeometry of\nsolids\u201d, and Whitehead's (1929) theory of \u201cextensive\nconnection\u201d mentioned in Section 3.1, and are now center stage\nin many mereological disputes at the intersection between metaphysics\nand the philosophy of space and time (see, for example, Sider 1993,\nForrest 1996a, Zimmerman 1996, Markosian 1998a, Schaffer 2003,\nMcDaniel 2006, Hudson 2007a, Arntzenius 2008, and J. Russell 2008, and\nthe papers collected in Hudson 2004; see also Soboci\u0144ski 1971 and\nEberle 1967 for some early treatments of these questions in the spirit\nof Le\u015bniewski's Mereology and of Leonard and Goodman's\nCalculus of Individuals, respectively). Here we shall confine\nourselves to a brief examination.\n\nThe two main options, to the effect that everything is ultimately made\nup of atoms, or that there are no atoms at all, are typically\nexpressed by the following postulates, respectively:\n\n\n(P.7)\nAtomicity\n\n\u2203y(Ay \u2227 Pyx) \n\n(P.8)\nAtomlessness\n\n\u2203yPPyx.  \n\n\n(See e.g. Simons 1987: 42.) These postulates are mutually\nincompatible, but taken in isolation they can consistently be added to\nany standard mereological theory X considered here.\nAdding (P.7) yields a corresponding Atomistic version,\nAX; adding (P.8) yields an Atomless version,\n\u00c3X. Since finitude together with the\nantisymmetry of parthood (P.3) jointly imply that mereological\ndecomposition must eventually come to an end, it is clear that any\nfinite model of M\u2014and a fortiori of\nany extension of M\u2014must be atomistic.\nAccordingly, an atomless mereology \u00c3X admits\nonly models of infinite cardinality. An example of such a model,\nestablishing the consistency of the atomless versions of most standard\nmereologies considered in this survey, is provided by the regular open\nsets of a Euclidean space, with \u2018P\u2019 interpreted as\nset-inclusion (Tarski 1935). On the other hand, the consistency of an\natomistic theory is typically guaranteed by the trivial one-element\nmodel (with \u2018P\u2019 interpreted as identity), though one can\nalso have models of atomistic theories that allow for infinite\ndomains. A case in point is provided by the closed intervals on the\nreal line, or the closed sets of a Euclidean space (Eberle 1970). In\nfact, it turns out that even when X is as strong as\nthe full calculus of individuals, corresponding to the theory\nGEM of Section 4.4, there is no purely\nmereological formula that says whether there are finitely or\ninfinitely many atoms, i.e., that is true in every finite model of\nAX but in no infinite model (Hodges and Lewis\n1968).\n\nConcerning Atomicity, it is also worth noting that (P.7) does not\nquite say that everything is ultimately made up of atoms; it\nmerely says that everything has atomic\n parts.[16]\n As such it rules out gunky worlds, but one may wonder whether it\nfully captures the atomistic intuition. In a way, the answer is in the\naffirmative. For, assuming Reflexivity and Transitivity, (P.7) is\nequivalent to the following\n\n\n(33)\nPzx \u2192 \u2203y(Ay \u2227\nPyx \u2227 Oyz),  \n\n\nwhich is logically equivalent to\n\n\n(34)\n((Ay \u2227 Pyx) \u2192 Pyx) \u2227\n(Pzx \u2192 \u2203y(Ay \u2227 Pyx\n\u2227 Oyz))  \n\n\n(adding a tautological conjunct), which is an instance of the general\nschema\n\n\n(35)\n(\u03c6y \u2192 Pyx) \u2227 (Pzx \u2192\n\u2203y(\u03c6y \u2227 Oyz)).  \n\n\nAnd (35) is the closest we can get to saying that x is\ncomposed of the \u03c6s, i.e., all and only those entities that satisfy\nthe given condition \u03c6 (in the present case: being an atomic part\nof x): every \u03c6 is part of x, and any part of\nx overlaps some \u03c6. Indeed, provided the \u03c6s are\npairwise disjoint, this is the standard definition of what it means\nfor something x to be composed of the \u03c6s (van Inwagen\n1990: 29), and surely enough, if the \u03c6s are all atomic, then they\nare pairwise disjoint. Thus, although (P.7) does not say that\neverything is ultimately composed of atoms, it implies it\u2014at\nleast in the presence of (P.1) and (P.2). (Of course, non-standard\nmereologies in which either postulates is rejected may not warrant the\ninitial equivalence, so in such theories (33) would perhaps be a\nbetter way to express the assumption of atomism.) In another way,\nhowever, (34) may still not be enough. For if the domain is infinite,\n(P.7) admits of models that seem to run afoul of the atomistic\ndoctrine. A simple example is a descending chain of decomposition that\nnever \u201cbottoms out\u201d, as in Figure 6: here x is\nultimately composed of atoms, but the pattern of decomposition that\ngoes down the right branch \u201clooks\u201d awfully similar to a\ngunky precipice. For a concrete example (from Eberle 1970: 75),\nconsider the set of all subsets of the natural numbers, with parthood\nmodeled by the subset relation. In such a universe, each singleton\n{n} will count as an atom and each infinite set {m:\nm > n} will be \u201cmade up\u201d of atoms.\nYet the set of all such infinite sets will be infinitely descending.\nModels of this sort do not violate the idea that everything is\nultimately composed of atoms. However, they violate the idea that\neverything can be decomposed into its ultimate constituents.\nAnd this may be found problematic if atomism is meant to carry the\nweight of metaphysical grounding: as J. Schaffer puts it, the\natomist's ontology seems to drain away \u201cdown a bottomless\npit\u201d (2007: 184); being is \u201cinfinitely deferred, never\nachieved\u201d (2010: 62). Are there any ways available to the\natomist to avoid this charge? One option would simply be to require\nthat every model be finite, or that it involve only a finite set of\natoms. Yet such requirements, besides being philosophically harsh and\ncontroversial even among atomists, cannot be formally implemented in\nfirst-order mereology, the former for well-known model-theoretic\nreasons and the latter in view of the above-mentioned result by Hodges\nand Lewis (1968). The only reasonable option would seem to be a\ngenuine strengthening of Atomicity in the spirit of what Cotnoir\n(2013c) calls \u201csuperatomism\u201d. Given any object x,\n(P.7) guarantees the existence of some parthood chain that\nbottoms out at an atom. Superatomicity would require that\nevery parthood chain of x bottoms out\u2014a\nproperty that fails in the model of Figure 6. At the moment, such ways\nof strengthening (P.7) have not been explored. However, in view of the\nconnection between classical mereology and Boolean algebras (see\nbelow, Section 4.4), mathematical models for superatomistic\nmereologies may be recovered from the work on superatomic Boolean\nalgebras initiated by Mostowski and Tarski (1939) and eventually\nsystematized in Day (1960). (A Boolean algebra is superatomic if and\nonly if every subalgebra is atomic, as with the algebra generated by\nthe finite subsets of a given set; see Day 1967 for an overview.) See\nalso Shiver (2015) for ways of strengthening (P.7) in the context of\nstronger mereologies such as GEM (Section 4.4), or\nwithin theories formulated in languages enriched with set variables or\nplural quantification.\n\n\nFigure 6. An infinitely descending atomistic model.\n(The ellipsis indicates repetition of the branching pattern.)\n\n\nAnother thing to notice is that, independently of their philosophical\nmotivations and formal limitations, atomistic mereologies admit of\nsignificant simplifications in the axioms. For instance,\nAEM can be simplified by replacing (P.5) and (P.7)\nwith\n\n\n(P.5\u2032)\nAtomistic Supplementation\n\n\u00acPxy \u2192 \u2203z(Az \u2227\nPzx \u2227 \u00acPzy), \n\n\nwhich in turns implies the following atomistic variant of the\nextensionality thesis (27):\n\n\n(27\u2032)\nx=y \u2194 \u2200z(Az\n\u2192 (Pzx \u2194 Pzy)).  \n\n\nThus, any atomistic extensional mereology is truly\n\u201chyperextensional\u201d in Goodman's (1958) sense: things built\nup from exactly the same atoms are identical. In particular, if the\ndomain of an AEM-model has only finitely many atoms,\nthe domain itself is bound to be finite. An interesting question,\ndiscussed at some length in the late 1960's (Yoes 1967, Eberle 1968,\nSchuldenfrei 1969) and taken up more recently by Simons (1987: 44f)\nand Engel and Yoes (1996), is whether there are atomless analogues of\n(27\u2032). Is there any predicate that can play the role of\n\u2018A\u2019 in an atomless mereology? Such a predicate would\nidentify the \u201cbase\u201d (in the topological sense) of the\nsystem and would therefore enable mereology to cash out Goodman's\nhyperextensional intuitions even in the absence of atoms. The question\nis therefore significant especially from a nominalistic perspective,\nbut it has deep ramifications also in other fields (e.g., in\nconnection with a Whiteheadian conception of space according to which\nspace itself contains no parts of lower dimensions such as points or\nboundary elements; see Forrest 1996a, Roeper 1997, and Cohn and Varzi\n2003). In special cases there is no difficulty in providing a positive\nanswer. For example, in the \u00c3EM model\nconsisting of the open regular subsets of the real line, the open\nintervals with rational end points form a base in the relevant sense.\nIt is unclear, however, whether a general answer can be given that\napplies to any sort of domain. If not, then the only option would\nappear to be an account where the notion of a \u201cbase\u201d is\nrelativized to entities of a given sort. In Simons's terminology, we\ncould say that the \u03c8-ers form a base for the \u03c6-ers if and only\nif the following variants of (P.5\u2032) and (P.7) are satisfied:\n\n\n(P.5\u03c6/\u03c8)\nRelative Supplementation\n\n(\u03c6x \u2227 \u03c6y) \u2192 (\u00acPxy\n\u2192 \u2203z(\u03c8z \u2227 Pzx \u2227\n\u00acPzy)) \n\n(P.7\u03c6/\u03c8)\nRelative Atomicity\n\n\u03c6x \u2192 \u2203y(\u03c8y \u2227\nPyx). \n\n\nAn atomistic mereology would then correspond to the limit case where\n\u2018\u03c8\u2019 is identified with the predicate \u2018A\u2019\nfor every choice of \u2018\u03c6\u2019. In an atomless mereology, by\ncontrast, the choice of the base would depend each time on the level\nof \u201cgranularity\u201d set by the relevant specification of\n\u2018\u03c6\u2019.\n\nConcerning atomless mereologies, one more remark is in order. For just\nas (P.7) is too weak to rule out unpleasant atomistic models, so too\nthe formulation of (P.8) may be found too weak to capture the intended\nidea of a gunky world. For one thing, as it stands (P.8) presupposes\nAntisymmetry. Absent (P.3), the symmetric two-element pattern in\nFigure 3, left, would qualify as atomless. To rule out such models\nindependently of (P.3), one should understand (P.8) in terms of the\nstronger notion of \u2018PP\u2019 given in (20\u2032), i.e., \n\n\n(P.8\u2032)\nProper Atomlessness\n\n\u2203y(Pyx \u2227 \u00acPxy). \n\n\nLikewise, note that the pattern in Figure 2, middle, will qualify as a\nmodel of (P.8) unless Supplementation is assumed, though again such a\npattern does not quite correspond to what philosophers ordinarily have\nin mind when they talk about gunk. It is indeed an interesting\nquestion whether Supplementation (or perhaps Quasi-supplementation, as\nsuggested by Gilmore 2016) is in some sense presupposed by the\nordinary concept of gunk. To the extent that it is, however, then\nagain one may want to be explicit, in which case the relevant\naxiomatization may be simplified. For instance,\n\u00c3MM can be simplified by merging (P.4) and\n(P.8) into a single axiom:\n\n\n(P.4\u2032\u2032)\nAtomless Supplementation\n\nPxy \u2192 \u2203z(PPzy \u2227\n(Ozx \u2192 x=y)). \n\n\nThere is, in addition, another, more important sense in which (P.8)\nmay seem too week. After all, infinite divisibility is loose talk.\nGiven (P.8) (and also given (P.8\u2032)), gunk may have denumerably\nmany, possibly continuum-many parts; but can it have more? Is there an\nupper bound on the cardinality on the number of pieces of gunk? Should\nit be allowed that for every cardinal number there may be\nmore than that many pieces of gunk? (P.8) is silent on these\nquestions. Yet these are certainly aspects of atomless mereology that\ndeserve scrutiny. It may even be thought that the world is not mere\ngunk but \u201chypergunk\u201d, as Nolan (2004: 305) calls\nit\u2014gunk such that, for any set of its parts, there is a set of\nstrictly greater cardinality containing only its parts. It is not\nknown whether such a theory is consistent (though Nolan conjectured\nthat a model can be constructed using the resources of standard set\ntheory with Choice and urelements together with some inaccessible\ncardinal axioms), and even if it were, some philosophers would\npresumably be inclined to regard hypergunk as a mere logical\npossibility (Hazen 2004). Nonetheless the question is indicative of\nthe sort of leeway that (P.8) leaves, and that one might want to\nregiment.\n\nSo much for the two main options, corresponding to atomicity and\natomlessness. What about theories that lie somewhere between these two\nextremes? Surely it may be held that there are atoms, though not\neverything need be made up of atoms; or it may be held that there is\natomless gunk, though not everything need be gunky. (The latter\nposition is defended e.g. by Zimmerman 1996.) Formally, these\npossibilities can be put again in terms of suitable restrictions on\n(P.7) and (P.8), by requiring that the relevant conditions hold\nexclusively of certain entities: \n\n\n(P.7\u03c6)\n\u03c6-Atomicity\n\n\u03c6x \u2192 \u2200y(Pyx \u2192\n\u2203z(Az \u2227 Pzy)) \n\n(P.8\u03c6)\n\u03c6-Atomlessness\n\n\u03c6x \u2192 \u2200y(Pyx \u2192\n\u2203zPPzy).  \n\n\nAnd the options in question would correspond to endorsing\n(P.7\u03c6) or (P.8\u03c6) for specific values of\n\u2018\u03c6\u2019. At present, no thorough formal investigation has\nbeen pursued in this spirit (though see Masolo and Vieu 1999 and\nHudson 2007b). Yet the issue is particularly pressing when it comes to\nthe mereology of the spatio-temporal world. For example, it is a\nplausible thought that while the question of atomism may be left open\nwith regard to the mereological structure of material objects (pending\nempirical findings from physics), one might be able to settle it\n(independently) with regard to the structure of space-time itself.\nThis would amount to endorsing a version of either\n(P.7\u03c6) or (P.8\u03c6) in which\n\u2018\u03c6\u2019 is understood as a condition that is satisfied\nexclusively by regions of space-time. Some may find it hard to\nconceive of a world in which an atomistic space-time is inhabited by\nentities that can be decomposed indefinitely (pace McDaniel\n2006), in which case accepting (P.7\u03c6) for regions would\nentail the stronger principle (P.7). However, (P.8\u03c6)\nwould be genuinely independent of (P.8) unless it is assumed that\nevery mereologically atomic entity should be spatially unextended, an\nassumption that is not part of definition (32) and that has been\nchallenged by van Inwagen (1981) and Lewis (1991: 32) (and extensively\ndiscussed in recent literature; see e.g. MacBride 1998, Markosian\n1998a, Scala 2002, J. Parsons 2004, Simons 2004, Tognazzini 2006,\nBraddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006, Hudson 2006a, McDaniel 2007, Sider\n2007, Spencer 2010). More generally, such issues depend on the broader\nquestion of whether the mereological structure of a thing should\nalways \u201cmirror\u201d or be in perfect \u201charmony\u201d\nwith that of its spatial or spatio-temporal receptacle, a question\naddressed in J. Parsons (2007) and Varzi (2007: \u00a73.3) and further\ndiscussed in Schaffer (2009), Uzquiano (2011) and Saucedo (2011). (For\nmore on this, see the entry\n location and mereology.)\n\nSimilar considerations apply to other decomposition principles that\nmay come to mind at this point. For example, one may consider a\nrequirement to the effect that \u2018PP\u2019 forms a dense\nordering, as already Whitehead (1919) had it:\n\n\n(P.9)\nDensity\n\nPPxy \u2192 \u2203z(PPxz \u2227\nPPzy). \n\n\nAs a general decomposition principle, (P.9) might be deemed too\nstrong, especially in an atomistic setting. (Whitehead's own theory\nassumes Atomlessness.) However, it is plausible to suppose that (P.9)\nshould hold at least with respect to the domain of spatio-temporal\nregions, regardless of whether these are construed as atomless gunk or\nas aggregates of spatio-temporal atoms. For more on this, see\nEschenbach and Heydrich (1995) and Varzi (2007: \u00a73.2).\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that if one assumed the existence of a\n\u201cnull item\u201d that is part of everything, corresponding to\nthe postulate\n\n\n(P.10)\nBottom\n\n\u2203x\u2200yPxy, \n\n\nthen such an entity would perforce be an atom. Accordingly, no\natomless mereology is compatible with this assumption. But it bears\nemphasis that (P.10) is at odds with a host of other theories as well.\nFor, given (P.10), the Antisymmetry axiom (P.3) will immediately\nentail that the atom in question is unique, while the Reflexivity\naxiom (P.1) will entail that it overlaps everything, hence that\neverything overlaps everything. This means that under such axioms the\nSupplementation principle (P.4) cannot be satisfied except in models\nwhose domain includes a single element. Indeed, this is also true of\nthe weaker Quasi-supplementation principle, (P.4d). It\nfollows, therefore, that the result of adding (P.10) to any theory at\nleast as strong as (P.1) + (P.3) + (P.4d), and a fortiori\nto MM and any extension thereof, will immediately\ncollapse to triviality in view of the following corollary:\n\n\n(36)\n\u2203x\u2200y x=y. \n\n\n\u2018Triviality\u2019 may strike one as the wrong word here. After\nall, there have been and continue to be philosophers who hold\nradically monistic ontologies\u2014from the Eleatics (Rea 2001) to\nSpinoza (J. Bennett 1984) all the way to contemporary authors such as\nHorgan and Potr\u010d (2000), whose comparative ontological parsimony\nresults in the thesis that the whole cosmos is but one huge extended\natom, an enormously complex but partless \u201cblobject\u201d. For\nall we know, it may even be that the best ontology for quantum\nmechanics, if not for Newtonian mechanics, consists in a lonely atom\nspeeding through configuration-space (Albert 1996). None of this is\ntrivial. However, none of this corresponds to fully endorsing (36),\neither. For such philosophical theories do not, strictly speaking,\nassert the existence of one single entity\u2014which is what\n(36) says\u2014but only the existence of a single material substance\nalong with entities of other kinds, such as properties or\nspatio-temporal regions. In other words, they only endorse a sortally\nrestricted version of (36). In its full generality, (36) is much\nstronger and harder to swallow, and most mereologists would rather\navoid it. The bottom line, therefore, is that theories endorsing\n(P.10) are likely to be highly non-standard, pace Carnap's\npersuasion that the null item would be a \u201cnatural and convenient\nchoice\u201d for certain purposes (such as providing a referent for\nall defective descriptions; see 1947: 37). A few authors have indeed\ngone that way, beginning with Martin (1943, 1965), who rejects\nunrestricted Reflexivity and characterizes the null item as\n\u201cthat which is not part of itself\u201d. Other notable\nexceptions include Bunt (1985) and Meixner (1997) and, more recently,\nHudson (2006) and Segal (2014), both of whom express sympathy for the\nnull individual at the cost of foregoing unrestricted\n(Quasi-)Supplementation. See also Priest (2014a and 2014b: \u00a76.13)\nand Cotnoir and Weber (2014), who avoid (36) through a paraconsistent\nrecasting of the underlying logic. Still another option would be to\ntreat the null item as a mere algebraic \u201cfiction\u201d and to\namend the entire mereological machinery accordingly, carefully\ndistinguishing between trivial cases of parthood and overlap (those\nthat involve the infectious null item) and genuine, non-trivial\nones:\n\n\n(37)\nGenuine Parthood\n\nGPxy =df Pxy \u2227\n\u2203z\u00acPxz \n\n(38)\nGenuine Overlap\n\nGOxy =df \u2203z(GPzx \u2227\nGPzy). \n\n\nThe basic M-axioms need not be affected by this\ndistinction. But stronger principles such as Supplementation could\ngive way to their \u201cgenuine\u201d counterparts, as in\n\n\n(P.4G)\nGenuine Supplementation\n\nPPxy \u2192 \u2203z(GPzy \u2227\n\u00acGOzx), \n\n\nand this would suffice to block the inference to (36) while keeping\nwith the spirit of standard mereology. This strategy is not uncommon,\nespecially in the mathematically oriented literature (see e.g. Mormann\n2000, Forrest 2002, Pontow and Schubert 2006), and we shall briefly\nreturn to it in Section 4.4 below. In general, however, mereologists\ntend to side with traditional wisdom and steer clear of (P.10)\naltogether.\n",
