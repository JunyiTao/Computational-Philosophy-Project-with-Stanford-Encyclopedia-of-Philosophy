    "main_text": "The Distinctiveness of Self-Knowledge || Special method\n1.2 Special method\n\nMost philosophers accept that there is some method of grasping\none\u2019s own mental states that is special in the sense\nthat it is available exclusively to the subject. Traditionally, this\nspecial method was construed as a kind of \u201cinward\u201d gaze,\ndirected at the mental state to be grasped.\n\nThe term \u201cintrospection\u201d\u2019\u2014literally,\n\u201clooking within\u201d\u2014captures a traditional way of\nconceiving how we grasp our own mental states. This term uses a\nspatial metaphor to express a divide between the \u201cinner\u201d\nworld of thought and the \u201cexternal\u201d world. The term\n\u201cintrospection\u201d is used in various ways in the\nself-knowledge literature. Perhaps the most common usage is that\nsuggested by the term\u2019s literal meaning: on this usage,\nintrospection is inner observation\u2014or \u201cinwardly directed\nattention\u201d (Goldman 2006: 246)\u2014that, when successful,\nyields awareness of a mental state. The notion that inner observation\nis the special method by which we achieve self-knowledge is central to\nthe acquaintance and inner sense accounts (see\n 3.1\n and\n 3.2\n below).\n\nWhile the term \u201cintrospection\u201d connotes a looking within,\na view that has recently gained prominence envisions the method unique\nto self-knowledge as requiring precisely the opposite. On this view,\nwe ascertain our own thoughts by looking outward, to the states of the\nworld they represent. This is known as the transparency\nmethod, in that self-knowledge is achieved by \u201clooking\nthrough\u201d the (transparent) mental state, directly to the state\nof the world it represents. This view is associated with a famous\npassage from Evans.\n\n\n[I]n making a self-ascription of belief, one\u2019s eyes are, so to\nspeak, or occasionally literally, directed outward\u2014upon the\nworld. If someone asks me \u201cDo you think there is going to be a\nthird world war?\u201d, I must attend, in answering him, to precisely\nthe same outward phenomena as I would attend to if I were answering\nthe question \u201cWill there be a third world war?\u201d (Evans\n1982: 225)\n\n\nThe idea that the special method by which we achieve self-knowledge\ninvolves transparency is central to empiricist transparency\naccounts (see\n 3.4)\n and to some agentialist accounts (see\n 3.7).\n",
