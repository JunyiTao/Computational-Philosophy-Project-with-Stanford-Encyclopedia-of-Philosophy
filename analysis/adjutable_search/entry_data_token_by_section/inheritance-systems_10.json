    "main_text": "Classification of Inheritance Systems || Inheritance Channels\n3.1 Inheritance Channels\n\nAn important distinction between inheritance channels and\ninheritance systems should be made before classifying\ninheritance systems. This distinction plays a central role in\ncontroversies over classifying and delimiting inheritance systems.\nSimply put, inheritance channels refer to \u201croutes across\ngenerations\u201d (in the words of Sterelny et al. (Sterelny et al.\n1996: 390)) through which hereditary resources or information pass\nfrom parent to offspring. The notion of inheritance system, in\ncontrast, as used by Jablonka and Lamb in particular, is meant to\nclassify inheritance factors, mechanisms, and processes, and the ways\nin which they store and carry hereditary information (Jablonka 2001;\nJablonka & Lamb 2005).\n\nMultiple inheritance channels may be involved in the reconstruction of\nthe phenotype. For example, as noted in the discussion of cellular\nheredity, inheritance of organelles during cell division is required\nfor the survival of daughter cells in addition to the inheritance of\nthe nuclear genome. The role of multiple channels is particularly\napparent in cases where phenotypes depend on symbiotic associations\nand thus on the transmission of symbionts. Examples of transmission of\nsymbionts include: (1) The transmission of gut bacteria, which are\nrequired for digestion and for normal intestinal development, from\nmother to offspring. (2) Fungus-growing ants depend on the cultivation\nof fungus for food in underground gardens. When new queens leave their\nparent colonies, they carry a fragment of the fungus with them to the\nsite of the new colony. (3) Various species of aphids, clams, and\nsponges allow some bacteria to pass through the oocytes from parent to\noffspring, leading to vertical transmission parallel to genetic\ntransmission. As a final example of multiple channels of inheritance\nnote that cultural transmission in humans and animals, which is\nrequired for the reconstruction of behavioral phenotypes such as bird\nsongs, food preferences, and other cultural traditions (Avital &\nJablonka 2000), may also be considered to constitute supplementary\ninheritance channels.\n\nThe same inheritance system may be used in multiple inheritance\nchannels. For example, the genetic inheritance system as defined by\nJablonka and Lamb is responsible for the inheritance of the\ninformation in the DNA in the eukaryotic nucleus and in the DNA of\nmitochondria. Horizontal gene transfer more generally is considered by\nJablonka and Lamb to belong to the genetic system (Jablonka & Lamb\n2005:. 233), though it typically involves additional vectors or\ntransmission channels. Conversely, a single inheritance channel may\ninvolve multiple inheritance systems, in the sense used by Jablonka\nand Lamb. For example, DNA methylation, an epigenetic mark, copied in\ncellular epigentic inheritance, is tied to the copying and\ntransmission of DNA. This arguably constitutes a single channel.\nEpigenetic mechanisms and heredity play a role in various properties\nof the genetic system, affecting things such as mutation and\nrecombination rates and hence genetic variation. Perhaps more\nfundamentally, epigenetic mechanisms are part of the mechanisms\n\u2018operating\u2019 the genetic channel. The inheritance of the\ngenome, when a cell divides, involves recreation of the mother\ncell\u2019s epigenetic state, a process that goes beyond copying\n(Lamm 2011, 2014; Lamm & Jablonka 2008).\n\nWhile many interesting cases involve identifying new inheritance\nchannels which are based on new inheritance systems, and discussions\nare often ambiguous as to which of the two notions they refer to, the\nstudy of inheritance systems is a separate endeavor from the analysis\nof the inheritance channels affecting individual organisms or traits.\nThe holistic view about inheritance, found in Developmental Systems\nTheory, rejects both the analysis of inheritance in terms of multiple\nsystems and in terms of multiple channels, arguing that both\ndistinctions are at most convenient idealizations (Griffiths &\nGray 2001), and it is not unusual for debates about holism to conflate\nthe discussion of the two issues. DST proponents argue that some\ndevelopmental resources are not easily represented as channels,\nespecially persistent resources, that holism is more heuristically\nproductive, and that channels are not statistically independent\ninformation carriers (Griffiths & Gray 2001; see also the useful\ndiscussion by Griesemer et al. (2005: 526)).\n\nIn response to the DST rejection of multiple channel accounts of\ninheritance, Griesemer et al. (2005) note the multiple ways in which\nchannels can be independent from one another. Channels may be\nindividuated as separate channels physically, chemically, or\nbiologically, regardless of whether they are statistically independent\ninformation channels. Additionally, causal independence should not be\nrequired for individuating inheritance channels. While Jablonka and\nLamb use a notion of biological information to characterize\ninheritance systems, they are not individuated based on statistical\nindependence, but rather mechanistically (or, more accurately,\nmechanismically, that is by identifying classes of inheritance\nmechanisms) and by biological function.\n",
