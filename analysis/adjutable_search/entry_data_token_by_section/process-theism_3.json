Dual Transcendence in Whitehead and Hartshorne\n\nThe dominant theological position in the West, which we have been\nreferring to as classical theism, denies all relativity to God. One\nmight suppose that the Christian doctrines of the Trinity and the\nIncarnation of God in Christ would temper disbelief in divine\nrelativity. The trend, however, was to argue that these doctrines do\nnot conflict with the denial of real relations in God. Claims of\nrevealed truth aside, the core doctrine has been that God, to be God,\nmust be in all respects absolute and in no respects relative. As goes\nthe contrast between absolute and relative, so go other metaphysical\ncontrasts. Theists traditionally held that God is in all\nrespects creator, active, infinite, eternal, necessary,\nindependent, immutable, and impassible and in no respects\ncreated, passive, finite, temporal, contingent, dependent, mutable, or\npassible. This view can be interpreted either as a doctrine about the\nnature of God or as a thesis about the parameters of responsible\ndiscourse about God (in the latter case it is called the via\nnegativa, or negative path). Hartshorne complains that, on\neither interpretation, traditional theology is guilty of a\n\u201cmonopolar prejudice,\u201d placing God (or talk about God) on\none side of polar contrasts and the world on the other. It is\nmonopolar insofar as deity is characterized by only one side\nof each pair of contrasts; it is prejudicial insofar as it\nholds to the invidious nature of the contrasts. As Hartshorne notes,\n\u201cOne pole of each contrary is regarded as more excellent than\nthe other, so that the supremely excellent being cannot be described\nby the other and inferior pole\u201d (Hartshorne and Reese 1953 [2000,\n2]).\n\nClassical theists certainly made provisions for speaking of God in\nways that suggested divine passion and even mutability. As Paul\nGavrilyuk argues, for the Church Fathers, divine impassibility was\nless a denial of God\u2019s emotional life than it was a qualifier\nthat ruled out \u201cpassions and experiences that were unbecoming of\nthe divine nature\u201d (Gavrilyuk 2004, 16). In a similar vein,\nMichael Dodds emphasizes that Aquinas did not construe divine\nimmutability as an attribute of God nor did he think that it implies\ninertness or stagnation. Nevertheless, Dodds, interpreting Aquinas,\nmaintains that immutability \u201cseems to signify divine being\n(esse) more appropriately [than mutability] since it more\nclearly indicates its distinction from all other things and its\ntranscendence of all human thought and language\u201d (Dodds 2008,\n157\u2013158).\n\nProcess theists also emphasize our limitations in knowing the reality\nof God, but they are not persuaded that it is best signified by only\none pair of the metaphysical contraries. If one is willing to concede\nthat God should not be conceived as immutable in the bad ways that\ncreatures are unchanging, why may not God be conceived as changeable\nin the good ways that creatures are, with the proviso that God\u2019s\nexcellence necessarily surpasses all else? Hartshorne notes that\nordinary language provides scanty support for and abundant evidence\nagainst the superiority of one pole over the other. We have already\nseen that process theism finds positive value in God\u2019s love\nbeing active as well as passive; it is as important that God wills the\ngood of the creatures as that God is affected by their joy and\nsuffering. Here is another of Hartshorne\u2019s many examples,\nexpressed with some humor:\n\nThe venerable dogma, \u2018agent is superior to patient\u2019, is\nnot derived from the study of knowledge. Indeed, it is not derived\nfrom any careful examination of ordinary cases. To speak is to be\nagent, to listen is to be patient, and those who want to show their\nsuperiority by speaking without listening are not trustworthy\nauthorities in the theory of value. (Hartshorne 1970, 231\u201332)\n\n\nHartshorne\u2019s larger point is that the pairs of metaphysical\ncontraries are not related as superior to inferior, but that\nthere are admirable and deficient manifestations of both sides. He\nsums this up in the principle of the non-invidiousness of the\nmetaphysical contraries (Hartshorne 1970, 268). If this principle\nis correct, and if God is conceived as the eminent embodiment of value\nand supremely worshipful being, then God must be conceived not in\nmonopolar terms but as dipolar, exemplifying the admirable forms of\nboth pairs of metaphysical contrasts. For example, rather than saying\nthat God is in all respects active and in no respects passive, the\nalternative is to say that God is active in some respects and passive\nin other respects, each in uniquely excellent ways. This is one\nmeaning of the expression \u201cdipolar theism\u201d; in light of\nother meanings to be given to \u201cdipolar\u201d in discussions of\nprocess theism, it is perhaps clearer to use Hartshorne\u2019s\nexpression for this idea: dual transcendence, that is to say,\nGod as the supreme embodiment of each pair of metaphysical\ncontraries.\n\nThe most elegant statement of dual transcendence is in the closing\npages of Process and Reality, a line of which we have already\nquoted. The complete quotation reads like a litany:\n\n\nIt is as true to say that God is permanent and the world fluent, as\nthat the World is permanent and God is fluent.\n\nIt is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the\nWorld is one and God many.\n\nIt is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual\neminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual\neminently.\n\nIt is as true to say that the World is immanent in God, as that God is\nimmanent in the World.\n\nIt is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World\ntranscends God.\n\nIt is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World\ncreates God. (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 348])\n\n\nWe saw above in the discussion of divine creativity that Whitehead\nindulges in poetic expression and that understanding his meaning\nrequires looking more closely at his metaphysical categories. Above\nall, however, what is required is a way of making principled\ndistinctions between different aspects of God so that the doctrine of\ndual transcendence does not collapse into contradiction. Let us\nexamine the different ways in which Whitehead and Hartshorne attempt\nto save the doctrine of dual transcendence from incoherence.\n",
