Hume had famously said in Section 7 of his\nEnquiry Concerning Human Understanding: \u201cWe may define\na cause to be an object followed by another, and where all the\nobjects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the\nsecond.\u201d Causal connections are said to consist in\ncontingent regularities established by observation. What the\nabove-cited passage from the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikasvav\u1e5btti suggests,\nhowever, is that for Dharmak\u012brti such mere regularities are\nsomehow not enough and that something stronger is at stake: there are\nfeatures \u201cin\u201d the causal relata themselves. Indeed his\ncausal theory of properties allows him to assert that fire, being what\nit is, must cause smoke under the right conditions and that smoke,\nbeing smoke, must be caused by fire. That being said, there\nare also very important passages in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s works\nwhere he does speak of establishing causality because one observes an\neffect when there is a particular cause and does not observe it when\nthat cause is absent. As in the case of Hume, this too is an\nobservation of regularities and would seem to be fallible, subject to\nexceptions. It is the Indian method of observing successive\nco-presence (anvaya) and co-absence (vyatireka) and\nis a type of induction used throughout Indian philosophy to establish\nconnections between two types of things. Dharmak\u012brti relies on a\nmulti-step procedure that is sometimes explained in terms of a\nthreefold combination of observations (upalabdhi) and\nnon-observations (anupalabdhi) and sometimes in terms of\nfive. Thus we have the so-called \u201ctriple\u201d or\n\u201cfivefold examination\u201d\n(trikapa\u00f1cakacint\u0101) of causality that is\ndeveloped by later Buddhist writers, such as Dharmottara,\nJ\u00f1\u0101na\u015br\u012bmitra and\n Mok\u1e63\u0101karagupta.[27]\n Other provisos are also added in an attempt to rule out certain bogus\ncircumstances that would vitiate the procedure (see e.g., Lasic 1999).\nThe details and problems cannot be taken up here. This method of\nanvaya and vyatireka has been profitably compared\nwith J.S. Mill\u2019s \u201cMethod of Agreement and Difference\u201d to\nestablish causation (see Matilal 1998,17; cf. Tillemans 2004,\n265\u2013269).\n\nSo how are these passages in Dharmak\u012brti and the commentarial\nliterature to be taken? How do his two positions hang together? One\ninterpretation might be to say that Dharmak\u012brti, somewhat\nna\u00efvely, thought he could arrive at a thoroughly\ninfallible inductive procedure by ever more adroit qualifications of\nthe observations and non-observations. Gillon (1991) is an attempt to\nshow that Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophy, in attempting to come up with\nsuch a watertight procedure, ran up against a problem of induction\nthat wouldn\u2019t go away. A more charitable exegesis is to say that his\nphilosophy recognizes that the way we find out through a\nposteriori methods whether or not x and y are\ncausally related is a quite different matter from what causality\nis\u2014the latter, as we had remarked, involves causal\nproperties of things that make them what they are. Thus we might have\nto discover empirically that fire will burn fuel under such and such\nconditions, but nonetheless that property is not one that it could do\nwithout and still be fire. The more sophisticated interpretation of\nDharmak\u012brti would then be that causality between things is a\nmore-than-contingent connection due to the constitutive properties of\nthings in this world, but nonetheless one that is established a\nposteriori. To take a modern analogy in a Kripkean vein, while\nwater must be H2O and whales must be mammals, we discover those facts,\nwhich in some sense could not be otherwise, through empirical\nmethods and fallibly  .\n",
