Race and Global Justice\n\nDiscussion of how histories of imperialism and racial discrimination\nhave shaped current patterns of global injustice have become more\nprominent in Anglo-American discussions of global justice. In\nparticular, concerns arise about how colonial histories affect\ncontinued oppression and exploitation of racial minority groups on a\nglobal scale (Mills 1997; Bell 2019; Boxill 2009; Okeja 2019; Buckinx,\nTrejo-Mathys, and Waligore 2015a; Lu 2017). Shining a light on how\ncolonialists often embraced beliefs about racial inferiority and\nsuperiority, theorists argue that white supremacy has played an\nimportant role in structuring ways of thinking about global justice.\nKey questions that emerge from such analysis include: Have debates\nabout global justice been inclined to ignore imperial histories\n(especially of racial domination) and if so, how should that be taken\ninto account now? Are egalitarian cosmopolitan accounts effectively\ntrying to promote liberal imperialism or can such discourse\neffectively combat it? What alternative resources can we find in other\ntraditions of political thought and practice for theorizing global\njustice in insightful ways? While some argue that liberalism and\nimperialism are inextricable (Mehta 1999), others are more optimistic\nabout liberalism\u2019s prospects. Yet others believe that sometimes\nimperial-like solutions are necessary to solve especially challenging\nproblems (Ignatieff 2003). (For a good range of views see Bell\n2019).\n\nReflecting on the philosophical field of global justice, it is notable\nthat until more recently, race is often absent from some of the most\nprominent discussions of global justice. Charles Mills was an\nespecially important figure in drawing attention to these omissions.\nIn his view, this means that theoretical debates have largely ignored\nor misunderstood \u201csome of the principal sources and sites of\ninjustice\u201d (2019). These omissions can often be traced to\ndominant methods in Anglo-American philosophy in which ideal\ntheorizing (in a Rawlsian fashion in particular) brackets out certain\nissues in a conscious way. But putting to the side issues of (say)\nracial domination means we will be blind to core histories and\npractices, such as slavery, imperialism, and racism that structure our\ncontemporary world.\n\nDiscussion of race and empire have not been completely ignored by\nglobal justice theorists. For instance, there is an important\nliterature on historical injustice and reparations (Butt 2008; Tan\n2007; Lu 2016; Barry and Goodin 2009), and another on trying to\nidentify how to describe the wrongs of colonialism (Ypi 2013b; Stilz\n2015; Valentini 2015). Margaret Moore draws attention to the ways in\nwhich the dispossession of land and racial domination are particularly\nimportant features in identifying the wrongs of settler colonialism\n(2016). And yet, the concerns Mills raises still resonate. What would\nglobal justice theorizing look like if it placed histories and\ncontemporary practices of racial domination at its core? How can we\nbetter integrate histories of colonialism and racial domination into\nour thinking about current problems of global justice?\n\nFor some, this means we must reject theoretical frameworks and\nvocabularies currently on offer by most political philosophers; others\ndo not believe wholesale rejection is needed. (For a good review of\npositions see Bell 2019). Charles Mills exemplifies the first\napproach. For Mills, global justice theorists have failed to take\nseriously global white supremacy and its legacy and this is especially\nnoteworthy given its role in understanding current patterns of global\ninequality, poverty and violence (1997, 2019). We need to consider\nthis history and make race a central site of investigation for global\njustice theorizing, which requires rejecting Rawlsian-style ideal\ntheorizing. It would also involve giving a more prominent role to\nissues of corrective justice and seeking compensation for the\nwide-scale massive injustices perpetrated through structures of global\nwhite supremacy. Similar views can be found in the work of\nOl\u00faf\u00e9\u0323mi T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 who writes:\n\u201cInjustice and oppression are global in scale\u2026 [b]ecause\nTrans-Atlantic slavery and colonialism built the world we live in, and\nslavery and colonialism were unjust and oppressive\u201d, reparations\nrequire remaking the \u201cworld system\u201d\n(T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 2022, 1). On his account, reparations\nrequire, among other things, reconciliation and eliminating\ninstitutional racism (T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 2022, 4).\n\nAnother very important literature has emerged concerning the many\nalternative understandings of justice that can be found in places\nformerly dominated by colonial occupation. Indigenous philosophies\nhave many important insights to offer (Lauer 2017; Metz 2017; Watene\n2022). In particular, scholars often consider the prospects for\nindigenous perspectives to promote global environmental justice (Whyte\n2014; Watene 2022). Locally embedded frameworks often support, but\nalso provide new alternatives to, traditional approaches to human\nneeds, rights, international development and justice issues more\ngenerally (Lauer 2017; Menkiti 2017; Metz 2017).\n\nInes Valdez (2019) argues we should substitute discourse centered on\nobligations and duties with one centered on power, coalition-building\nand contestation. Kimberley Hutchings (2019) emphasizes that in\ndecolonizing our theorizing about global justice, we have to change\nthe way we see the practice of global justice theorizing. We need to\nthink of the latter less as a way to arrive at answers to global\njustice questions and more as a way to live with others without\nsubsuming them into a particular world. Rather, opening up the\nconversation to sharing different perspectives we embark on a\ncollaborative approach to experiments in living and being with others.\nIt is not about finding new answers to what we mean by justice but\nrather \u201cabout finding new ways of relating to ourselves and to\neach other in our pursuit of whatever we may think of as\njustice\u201d (2019, 121). Adopting such perspectives may reduce some\nnoted tensions in being part of a world community and others that are\nsmaller, drawn along racial, ethnic or other identity lines (Appiah\n2007).\n\nFor more on these topics see the entries on\n colonialism,\n race,\n black reparations,\n reconciliation,\n transitional justice,\n and\n critical philosophy of race.\n",
