    "main_text": "\n\nThe causes and effects of corruption, and how to combat corruption,\nare issues that have been very much on the national and international\nagendas of politicians and other policymakers in recent decades\n(Heidenheimer and Johnston 2002; Heywood 2018). Moreover, various\nhistorically influential philosophers, notably Plato (The\nRepublic), Aristotle (The Politics), Machiavelli\n(The Prince and The Discourses), Hobbes (The\nLeviathan) and Montesquieu (The Spirit of the Laws),\nhave concerned themselves with political corruption in particular,\nalbeit in somewhat general terms (Sparling 2019; Blau 2009). For these\nphilosophers corruption consisted in large part in rulers governing in\nthe service of their own individual or collective\u2014or other\nfactional\u2014self-interest, rather than for the common good and in\naccordance with the law or, at least, in accordance with legally\nenshrined moral principles. They also emphasized the importance of\nvirtues, where it was understood that the appropriate virtues for\nrulers might differ somewhat from the appropriate virtues for\ncitizens. Indeed, Machiavelli, in particular, famously or, perhaps,\ninfamously argued in The Prince that the rulers might need to\ncultivate dispositions, such as ruthlessness, that are inconsistent\nwith common\n morality.[1]\n And Plato doubted that the majority of people were even capable of\npossessing the requisite moral and intellectual virtues required to\nplay an important role in political institutions; hence his rejection\nin The Republic of democracy in favor of rule by\nphilosopher-kings. Moreover, these historically important political\nphilosophers were concerned about the corruption of the citizenry: the\ncorrosion of the civic virtues. This theme of a corrupt citizenry, as\nopposed to a corrupt leadership or institution, has been notably\nabsent in contemporary philosophical discussion of the corruption of\npolitical institutions until quite recently. However, recently the\ncorruption of political institutions and of the citizenry as a\nconsequence of the proliferation of disinformation, propaganda,\nconspiracy theories and hate speech on social media, in particular\n(Woolley and Howard 2019), has become an important phenomenon which\nphilosophers have begun to address (Lynch 2017; Cocking and van den\nHoven 2018; Miller and Bossomaier 2023: Ch. 4). Social media bots are\nused inter alia to automatically generate disinformation (as well as\ninformation), propagate ideologies (as well as non-ideologically based\nopinions), and function as fake accounts to inflate the followings of\nother accounts and to gain followers. The upshot is that the moral\nright of freedom to communicate has frequently not been exercised\nresponsibly; moral obligations to seek and communicate truths rather\nthan falsehoods have not been discharged, resulting in large-scale\nsocial, political and, in some cases, physical harm. One key set of\nethical issues here pertains to an important form of institutional\ncorruption: corruption of the democratic process. For instance,\nrevelations concerning the data firm Cambridge Analytica\u2019s\nillegitimate use of the data of millions of Facebook users to\ninfluence elections in the U.S. and elsewhere highlighted the ethical\nissues arising from the use of machine learning techniques for\npolitical purposes by malevolent foreign actors. The problem here is\ncompounded by home-grown corruption of democratic institutions by\npeople who wilfully undermine electoral and other institutional\nprocesses in the service of their own political and personal goals.\nFor instance, Donald Trump consistently claimed, and continues to\nclaim, that the 2020 U.S. presidential election which he demonstrably\nlost involved massive voter fraud. The problem has also been\ngraphically illustrated in the U.S. by the rise of home-grown\nextremist political groups fed via social media on a diet of\ndisinformation, conspiracy theories, hate speech, and propaganda; a\nprocess which led to the violent attack in January 2021 on the Capitol\nbuilding which houses the U.S. Congress.\n\nIn the modern period, in addition to the corruption of political\ninstitutions, the corruption of other kinds of institutions, notably\nmarket-based institutions, has been recognised. For example, the World\nBank (1997) some time back came around to the view that the health of\neconomic institutions and progress in economic development is closely\nlinked to corruption reduction. In this connection there have been\nnumerous anti-corruption initiatives in multiple jurisdictions, albeit\nthis is sometimes presented as politically motivated. Moreover, the\nGlobal Financial Crisis and its aftermath have revealed financial\ncorruption, including financial benchmark manipulation, and spurred\nregulators to consider various anti-corruption measures by way of\nresponse (Dobos, Pogge and Barry 2011). And in recent decades there\nhave been ongoing efforts to analyze and devise means to combat\ncorruption in in police organizations, in the professions, in the\nmedia, and even in universities and other research-focused\ninstitutions.\n\nWhile contemporary philosophers, with some exceptions, have been slow\nto focus on corruption, the philosophical literature is increasing,\nespecially in relation to political corruption (Thompson 1995; Dobel\n2002; Warren 2006; Lessig 2011; Newhouse 2014; Philp and David-Barrett\n2015; Miller 2017; Schmidtz 2018; Blau 2018; Philp 2018; Thompson\n2018; Sparling 2019; Ceva & Ferretti 2021). For instance, until\nrelatively recently the concept of corruption had not\nreceived much attention, and much of the conceptual work on corruption\nhad consisted in little more than the presentation of brief\ndefinitions of corruption as a preliminary to extended accounts of the\ncauses and effects of corruption and the ways to combat it. Moreover,\nmost, but not all, of these definitions of corruption were\nunsatisfactory in fairly obvious ways. However, recently a number of\nmore theoretically sophisticated definitions of corruption and related\nnotions, such as bribery, have been provided by philosophers. Indeed,\nphilosophers have also started to turn their minds to issues of\nanti-corruption, e.g., anti-corruption systems (often referred to as\n\u201cintegrity systems\u201d), and in doing so theorizing the\nsources of corruption and the means to combat it.\n",
