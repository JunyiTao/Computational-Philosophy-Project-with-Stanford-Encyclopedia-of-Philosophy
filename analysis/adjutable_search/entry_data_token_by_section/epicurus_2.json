    "main_text": "Physical Theory\n3. Physical Theory\n\nEpicurus held that the elementary constituents of nature are\nundifferentiated matter, in the form of discrete, solid and\nindivisible particles (\u201catoms\u201d) below the threshold of\nperception, plus empty space, that is, the complement of matter or\nwhere matter is not (Inwood 1981, Konstan 2014; contra Sedley 1982,\nwho argues that space, for Epicurus, is a continuous matrix extending\nuniformly throughout the universe, and is either occupied by matter or\nempty). In its broad outline, Epicurus inherited this scheme from the\nearlier atomists, above all Democritus. But Democritus\u2019 version\nhad been the object of critiques by later thinkers, especially\nAristotle, in part for incoherencies in the notion of an infinite\nvoid, in part for problems attaching to his idea of minima, or\nentities of the smallest conceivable size (see especially\nPhysics Book 6). First, freestanding entities of minimal size\ncould have no edges, and so no shapes, or rather would be all edge:\nthus, if two minima touched, they would wholly overlap. (The same\nargument applies to points in a line, which is why a line contains\npoints but is not composed of them, according to Aristotle.) Further,\nif atoms really are conceptually indivisible, and not just physically\nunsplittable, then when two atoms pass by each other it is impossible\nthat they should at any time be only partway past, for this would\nimply a point partway along the length of the atom, which contradicts\nthe premise that it is a minimum. Although Aristotle does not state\nthe argument precisely in this form, it is apparent that a strict\nconception of minimal-sized atoms entails that motion too must consist\nof discontinuous quanta; and if motion, then time. Atoms must, then,\nAristotle inferred, move in discrete hops (kin\u00eamata),\neach one occupying a single temporal minimum \u2014 and hence, all\natoms must move at a uniform speed. An infinite void, with atoms\ndistributed throughout it, led to problems of its own, for it permits\nno intrinsic spatial orientation and hence no account of why things\nfall, as they are observed to do.\n\nThe problem for Epicurus was to find a way of explaining the natural\nphenomena of bodily movement while responding to the challenges posed\nby Aristotle\u2019s criticisms of Democritus\u2019 theory. Epicurus\nrose to the challenge, although one cannot be certain that he was\nresponding directly to Aristotle\u2019s critique. (It is unclear\nwhether or how much philosophers of Epicurus\u2019 generation who\nwere not members of Aristotle\u2019s own school had access to\nAristotle\u2019s treatises.)\n\nFirst, he distinguished between the atom, which by its nature cannot\nbe broken apart, and the minimum conceivable expanse of matter: atoms\nhave such minima as parts, but are not minima themselves \u2014 there\ncan be no free-standing entity one minimum expanse in size. This\nresolves the problem of atomic edges, and also that of how atoms can\ncome in different shapes and sizes (though never large enough to be\nseen): to have the hooks and crevices needed to form compounds, they\ncan scarcely be theoretically partless. Second, Epicurus agreed that\ntime too is discontinuous, as is motion: Simplicius (p.\n934.23\u201330 Diels; translation in Konstan 1989) quotes him as\naffirming that it is untrue to say that an atom is moving over a\nminimum interval, but only that it has moved (some scholars maintain\nthat this is a later innovation in the school; see especially Verde\n2013). What is more, as Aristotle had argued must be the case, atoms\nall move at the same velocity (the principle of isotakheia).\nThis last claim entailed difficulties of its own, such as how atoms\never overtake each other, if they are moving in the same direction.\n(Lucretius invoked the idea of a random swerve to solve this one; see\nbelow.) But it also provided a solution to another problem, that of\nentropy: for since atoms can never slow down, the universe can never\ncome to a halt (in modern terms, there is no loss of energy). As for\ngravity, Epicurus may have had a solution to this too, and in a novel\nform. If an atom just on its own cannot slow down or alter its\ndirection of motion, then an atom that is rising or moving in an\noblique direction cannot at some point begin to tilt or fall, unless\nsomething blocks its progress and forces it to do so. If, however,\nafter a collision atoms tended to emerge in a statistically favored\ndirection \u2014 that is, if the motions of all atoms after\ncollisions did not cancel each other out but on average produced a\nvector, however small, in a given direction, then that direction would\nby definition be down. The absence of a global orientation in the\nuniverse was thus immaterial. Due to this vector, any given world\nwill, like our own, be similarly oriented in respect to the direction\n\u201cdown.\u201d (Given the infinite expanse of the universe on\nEpicurean theory \u2014 see below \u2014 we must expect there to be\na plurality of worlds, some like ours, some \u2014 within limits\n\u2014 different.)\n\nMacroscopic objects, of course, do not move at a uniform and very\ngreat speed; the atoms within them do, but their motions are\nrestricted and deflected by neighboring atoms, and so they vibrate. In\nthe case of compound objects that are completely at rest, the\nresultant of internal atomic motions is zero, relative, at least, to\nthe earth, which may have an average motion of its own. If so, and if\nfor some reason the earth\u2019s motion is slower in a downward\ndirection than that of objects on or near its surface \u2014 because,\nsay, the earth is disk-shaped, as Epicurus held, and hence sinks more\nslowly in the surrounding atomic medium, like a falling leaf \u2014\nthen Epicurus could explain as well why things like stones tend to\nfall to the earth\u2019s surface when let go.\n\nEpicurus operated with a highly limited number of elementary\nprinciples in nature \u2014 he did not know the concept of force, for\nexample, or the associated ideas of attraction and repulsion among\natoms, not to mention more arcane properties \u2014 and for all his\nefforts to account for all the physical features of the world on the\nbasis of this theory, paradoxes remained. An excellent one is posed by\nSextus Empiricus (Against the Physicists = M\n10.144\u201348), which at the same time gives an idea of how\nEpicurean atoms were understood to behave (at least in Sextus\u2019\ntime, late 2nd century C.E.). Sextus imagined two atoms\nseparated by a distance of nine minima, traveling at the same speed\n(as atoms must) toward each other; after four temporal minima, the\natoms would be one spatial minimum apart. Then what? They cannot meet\nin the middle of the remaining distance, by the very concept of a\nminimum. Nor can one cross the interval before the other, without\nviolating the rule of equal velocity. But how, then, can they meet at\nall? We do not know an Epicurean reply to this conundrum. Perhaps\natoms are always an even number of minimal spaces apart from one\nanother. Or else, minima are always bundled in such large quantities\nthat it is meaningless to speak of an odd or even number of minima\nbetween atoms; the Stoics, at all events, held that whether the number\nof stars, for example, is odd or even is absolutely or naturally\nnon-evident (kathapax adela, Sextus Empiricus Outline of\nPyrrhonism = PH 2.97, M 8.147; physei\nadela, M 8.317\u201318). But Epicurus believed that\nmotion at the atomic level obeyed different laws from those that\nappear to operate at the level of macroscopic objects (that atomic\nmotion is discontinuous is an example). Perhaps, then, motions over\nsmall numbers of minima were in some sense indiscernible. Finally, it\nis possible that he discounted such a puzzle as a purely mathematical\nparadox, since it is recorded that he had little interest in\nmathematics as a separate science from physics and believed it to be\nirrelevant to the proper study of physics.\n\nFascinating as these questions are in their own right, Epicurus\nhimself does not proceed by creating an abstract model, exploring its\ninternal coherence, and determining its applicability to phenomena, in\nthe ideal manner of modern science. Rather, he begins with the\ntestimony of the senses, which he thinks are always reliable. These\nprovide a basis on which to draw conclusions either with respect to\nthings that still await confirmation or those that are by nature\nimperceptible (Letter to Herodotus = LH 38). Thus,\nin beginning his account of the physical world in this Letter, he\nargues that things cannot arise out of nothing, since otherwise there\nwould be no need of specific seeds for specific plants and animals,\nand anything whatsoever could be generated out of just any types of\nmaterial elements. Since this is not seen to happen, but reproduction\nin things we can observe with our senses is in fact orderly and\ndeterminate, spontaneous generation at any level is ruled out. The\nlogic is what Epicurus calls counterwitnessing: a hypothetical premise\n(here, that things sometimes arise out of nothing) is eliminated\nbecause experience tells against its conclusion (here, that the coming\ninto being of visible objects does not require determinate seeds or\nmaterials). More simply, if A then B; but not\nB, hence not A. One might, of course, challenge the\nimplication: something might arise from nothing, even if there are no\ncases of chickens giving birth to horses. The important point,\nhowever, is that Epicurus invokes the data of perception to testify\nfor or against the nature of elementary phenomena; he assumes a\ncertain uniformity of nature at all levels. So too with his next\npostulate: things are not destroyed into what is not, since in that\ncase everything would cease to exist (and would have ceased to exist\nbefore now, given infinite past time \u2014 recall that nothing is\ncreated out of nothing); but things do exist, hence the premise is\nfalse.\n\nAs for bodies (note the plural: Epicurus does not typically speak of\nmatter per se) and void as the basic physical principles, the senses,\nEpicurus affirms, testify to the existence of bodies, and by\ncalculation on the basis of the senses we infer the nature of what is\ninvisible, for example the atoms (LH 39). Here the reasoning\nis based on analogy: what is evident to our senses must be true on the\nmicroscopic level as well, at least in some respects. Void must exist,\nin turn, if bodies are to be able to move, as they are seen to do.\nThus motion is the counterwitness to the non-existence of void \u2014\nan indirect argument is required since one cannot perceive empty\nspace. What is more, since bodies, being \u201cfull,\u201d offer\nresistance and void, being empty, offers no resistance, they\ncomplement each other and exhaust the possibilities; hence it is\nimpossible to conceive of anything besides these two principles, apart\nfrom things that are accidents of them \u2014 accidents that arise\nfrom unions of elementary bodies in the void. (Inconceivability is\nanother tool in Epicurus\u2019 method of demonstration.) These\nelementary bodies, then, are the atoms, which are indivisible and\ninalterable, if things are not to dissolve into nothingness. The\nLetter to Herodotus is an epitome of Epicurean doctrine, and\nthe arguments are crisp and abbreviated, but the reasoning is clear,\nand is confirmed by the more detailed treatment in Lucretius, which\nalmost certainly follows Epicurus\u2019 On Nature (see Leone\n2012). Epicurus appeals to some elementary intuitions concerning\nbodies and their movement through space in order to establish the\nstructure of imperceptibly small things; he concludes that these must\nbe inalterable if nature is not to dissolve into nothing (creation\nback out of nothing having already been eliminated by the argument\ncited above from regularity in generation); and the basic features of\nthe atomic system are then in place. A similar appeal to the senses\nestablishes the infinity of the universe, since what is finite must\nhave an edge, and an edge is conceived in reference to something\nbeyond it. But the universe \u2014 in Greek, the \u201call\u201d\n\u2014 contains everything, and so there is nothing outside it by\nwhich to conceive an edge. Hence, it is infinite. And if the all is\ninfinite, so is the void and the number of atoms as well, for\notherwise atoms would be too widely dispersed ever to meet\n(LH 41\u201342).\n\nEpicurus now has in place the fundamental constituents of his natural\nworld, and he might have stopped here, with atoms and void and the\ndenial, on the grounds of inconceivability, of any other kind of basic\nphysical principle. All secondary properties, such as color and taste,\nwill be explained as epiphenomena of atomic combinations, and\nperception of things at a distance by the continual emission of\ninfinitesimally thin laminas from objects, which maintain the relevant\nfeatures of the source (in the case of vision, for example, the\nlaminas will preserve the atomic patterns specific to the color and\nshape of the object) and directly stimulate the relevant sense organ.\nThis is a tricky thesis, and again posed puzzles: how do the lamina or\nsimulacra, as Lucretius called them, of a mountain enter the eye, for\nexample? In fragments? By somehow shrinking? We do not know the answer\nto this one, but there are some plausible hypotheses (see Leone 2012;\nKonstan 2020). A few more concepts fill in the picture of the natural\nworld: thus, Epicurus denies that there can be infinitely many kinds\nof atoms, for then all shapes (which define the kinds) at any given\nmagnitude would be exhausted and atoms would have to reach visible\nproportions, which we know that they do not (this argument depends on\nthe idea of minima, discussed further below); instead, the number of\nkinds (i.e., shapes of various microscopic sizes) is inconceivably\nlarge but \u201cnot strictly infinite,\u201d whereas the number of\neach kind of atom is simply infinite (LH 55\u201356). This\ncondition is also invoked to explain why there is a limit on possible\ntypes of combinations of atoms, and hence on the number of viable\nspecies of things in the perceptible world: if there were infinitely\nmany kinds of atoms, Epicurus believed, they could combine to generate\nabsolutely anything \u2014 an infinity of different sorts of\nthing.\n\nBut an infinite number of solid and therefore indivisible atoms of\nfinitely many kinds, such as Epicurus\u2019 theory provides, are\nenough to avoid the possibility of the universe crumbling into\nnothing. Why did Epicurus complicate matters still further with the\ndoctrine that atoms themselves consist of still smaller parts in the\nform of mathematically minimal expanses, as we saw above that he does?\nFinite bodies, according to Epicurus, had to be composed of smaller\nexpanses, and if there were no lower limit in size to such expanses,\none would have to imagine traversing such a body in an infinite number\nof moves \u2014 but then, however small these infinitesimals might\nbe, the object that contained them, Epicurus reasoned, would have to\nbe infinitely large (LH 56\u201357). What are such minima\nlike? Epicurus asks us to think of the smallest perceptible thing. It\ndiffers from larger visible entities in that it has no sub-parts to be\ntraversed with the eye: if you do attempt to visualize such sub-parts,\nthey simply coincide with the original perceptible minimum. Since such\nminimal visible entities have no parts, they do not touch edge to edge\n(edges are parts), and yet they measure out the body that contains\nthem, larger bodies having more such minima. By analogy with the\nvisible, then, we conceive of the smallest part of an atom\n(LH 58\u201359). This conception resembles the way points\nexist in a line, according to Aristotle, since they too do not touch,\nnor can they exist independently. But Epicurean minima differ from\npoints in that they are physical expanses and so have extension. This\nlooks like a contradictory state of affairs: can we imagine, for\nexample, an atom consisting of just two minima? Or ten? It would be\nlike counting up the least visible bits of a perceptible object.\nGeometrical problems arise as well, since it was known that the side\nand diagonal of a cube, for example, were incommensurable, yet both\nmust, it would appear, be composed of finite and hence commensurable\nnumbers of minima. On the assumption that Epicurus was aware of and\ncared about such puzzles, it has been suggested that he thought any\natom consists of a not strictly infinite, but inconceivably large\n\u2014 and so \u201cnot strictly finite\u201d \u2014 number of\nminima (see Konstan 1989a): thus, the minimum may be imagined as the\ninverse of the number of kinds of atoms postulated by Epicurus, a\nquantity that takes on a quasi-technical status as a special order of\nmagnitude. But sufficient evidence for this hypothesis is lacking.\n",
