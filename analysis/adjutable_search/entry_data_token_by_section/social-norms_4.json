Game-Theoretic Accounts\n\nThe traditional rational choice model of compliance depicts the\nindividual as facing a decision problem in isolation: if there are\nsanctions for non-compliance, the individual will calculate the\nbenefit of transgression against the cost of norm compliance, and\neventually choose so as to maximize her expected utility. Individuals,\nhowever, seldom choose in isolation: they know the outcome of their\nchoice will depend on the actions and beliefs of other individuals.\nGame theory provides a formal framework for modeling strategic\ninteractions.\n\nThomas Schelling (1960), David Lewis (1969), Edna Ullmann-Margalit\n(1977), Robert Sugden (1986) and, more recently, Peyton Young (1993),\nCristina Bicchieri (1993), and Peter Vanderschraaf (1995) have\nproposed a game-theoretic account according to which a norm is broadly\ndefined as an equilibrium of a strategic interaction. In\nparticular, a Nash equilibrium is a combination of strategies (one for\neach individual), such that each individual\u2019s strategy is a best\nreply to the others\u2019 strategies. Since it is an equilibrium, a\nnorm is supported by self-fulfilling expectations in the sense that\nplayers\u2019 beliefs are consistent, and thus the actions that\nfollow from players\u2019 beliefs will validate those very beliefs.\nCharacterizing social norms as equilibria has the advantage of\nemphasizing the role that expectations play in upholding norms. On the\nother hand, this interpretation of social norms does not prima\nfacie explain why people prefer to conform if they expect others\nto conform.\n\nTake for example conventions such as putting the fork to the\nleft of the plate, adopting a dress code, or using a particular sign\nlanguage. In all these cases, my choice to follow a certain rule is\nconditional upon expecting most other people to follow it. Once my\nexpectation is met, I have every reason to adopt the rule in question.\nIn fact, if I do not use the sign language everybody else uses, I will\nnot be able to communicate. It is in my immediate interest to follow\nthe convention, since my main goal is to coordinate with other people.\nIn the case of conventions, there is a continuity between the\nindividual\u2019s self-interest and the interests of the community\nthat supports the convention. This is the reason why David Lewis\nmodels conventions as equilibria of coordination games. Such\ngames have multiple equilibria, but once one of them has been\nestablished, players will have every incentive to keep playing it (as\nany deviation will be costly).\n\nTake instead a norm of cooperation. In this case, the expectation that\nalmost everyone abides by it may not be sufficient to induce\ncompliance. If everyone is expected to cooperate one may be tempted,\nif unmonitored, to behave in the opposite way. The point is that\nconforming to social norms, as opposed to conventions, is\nalmost never in the immediate interest of the individual. Often there\nis a discontinuity between the individual\u2019s self-interest and\nthe interests of the community that supports the social norm.\n\nThe typical game in which following a norm would provide a better\nsolution (than the one attained by self-centered agents) is a\nmixed-motive game such as the prisoner\u2019s dilemma or the\ntrust game. In such games the unique Nash equilibrium represents a\nsuboptimal outcome. It should be stressed that\u2014whereas a\nconvention is one among several equilibria of a coordination\ngame\u2014a social norm can never be an equilibrium of a mixed-motive\ngame. However, Bicchieri (2006) has argued that when a norm exists it\ntransforms the original mixed-motive game into a coordination\none. As an example, consider the following prisoner\u2019s dilemma\ngame\n (Figure 1),\n where the payoffs are B=Best, S=Second, T=Third, and W=Worst. Clearly\nthe only Nash equilibrium is to defect (D), in which case both players\nget (T,T), a suboptimal outcome. Suppose, however, that society has\ndeveloped a norm of cooperation; that is, whenever a social dilemma\noccurs, it is commonly understood that the parties should privilege a\ncooperative attitude. Should, however, does not imply\n\u201cwill\u201d, therefore the new game generated by the existence\nof the cooperative norm has two equilibria: either both players defect\nor both cooperate.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nNote that, in the new coordination game (which was created by the\nexistence of the cooperative norm), the payoffs are quite different\nfrom those of the original prisoner\u2019s dilemma. Thus there are\ntwo equilibria: if both players follow the cooperative norm they will\nplay an optimal equilibrium and get (B,B), whereas if they both choose\nto defect they will get the suboptimal outcome (S,S). Players\u2019\npayoffs in the new coordination game differ from the original payoffs\nbecause their preferences and beliefs will reflect the existence of\nthe norm. More specifically, if a player knows that a cooperative norm\nexists and has the right kind of expectations, then she will have a\npreference to conform to the norm in a situation in which she can\nchoose to cooperate or to defect. In the new game generated by the\nnorm\u2019s existence, choosing to defect when others cooperate is\nnot a good choice anymore (T,W). To understand why, let us look more\nclosely to the preferences and expectations that underlie the\nconditional choice to conform to a social norm.\n\nBicchieri (2006) defines the expectations that underlie norm\ncompliance, as follows:\n\n(a)\nEmpirical expectations: individuals believe that a\nsufficiently large subset of the relevant group/population conforms to\nthe norm in situations of type S and either\n(b)\nNormative expectations: individuals believe that a\nsufficiently large subset of the relevant group/population expects\nthem to conform to the norm in situations of\ntype S;\n\n\nor\n\n(b\u2032)\nNormative expectations with sanctions: individuals\nbelieve that a sufficiently large subset of the relevant\ngroup/population expects them to conform to the norm in situations of\ntype S, prefers them to conform and may sanction\nbehavior.\n\n\nNote that universal compliance is not usually needed for a norm to\nexist. However, how much deviance is socially tolerable will depend on\nthe norm in question. Group norms and well-entrenched social norms\nwill typically be followed by almost all members of a group or\npopulation, whereas greater deviance is usually accepted when norms\nare new or they are not deemed to be socially important. Furthermore,\nas it is usually unclear how many people follow a norm, different\nindividuals may have different beliefs about the size of the group of\nfollowers, and may also have different thresholds for what\n\u201csufficiently large\u201d means. What matters to conformity is\nthat an individual believes that her threshold has been reached or\nsurpassed. For a critical assessment of the above definition of\nnorm-driven preferences, see Hausman (2008).\n\nBrennan et al. (2013) also argue that norms of all kinds share in an\nessential structure. Norms are clusters of normative attitudes in a\ngroup, combined with the knowledge that such a cluster of attitudes\nexists. On their account, \u201cA normative principle P is a\nnorm within a group G if and only if:\n\nA significant proportion of the members of G\nhave P-corresponding normative attitudes; and\nA significant proportion of the members of G\nknow that a significant proportion of the members of G have\nP-corresponding attitudes\u201d (Brennan et al. 2013:\n29)\n\n\nOn this account, a \u201cP-corresponding normative\nattitude\u201d is understood to be a judgment, emotional state,\nexpectation, or other properly first personal normative belief that\nsupports the principle P (e.g., Alice thinking most people\nshould P would count as a normative attitude).\n Condition (i)\n is meant to reflect genuine first personal normative commitments,\nattitudes or beliefs.\n Condition (ii)\n is meant to capture those cases where individuals know that a large\npart of their group also shares in those attitudes. Putting conditions\n(i) and (ii) together offers a picture that the authors argue allows\nfor explanatory work to be done on a social-level normative concept\nwhile remaining grounded in individual-level attitudes.\n\nConsider again the new coordination game of\n Figure 1:\n for players to obey the norm, and thus choose C, it must be the case\nthat each expects the other to follow it. In the original\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma, empirical beliefs would not be sufficient to\ninduce cooperative behavior. When a norm exists, however, players also\nbelieve that others believe they should obey the norm, and may even\npunish them if they do not. The combined force of empirical and\nnormative expectations makes norm conformity a compelling choice, be\nit because punishment may follow or just because one recognizes the\nlegitimacy of others\u2019 expectations (Sugden 2000).\n\nIt is important to understand that conformity to a social norm is\nalways conditional on the expectations of what the relevant other/s\nwill do. We prefer to comply with the norm as we have certain\nexpectations. To make this point clear, think of the player who is\nfacing a typical one-shot prisoner\u2019s dilemma with an unknown\nopponent. Suppose the player knows a norm of cooperation exists and is\ngenerally followed, but she is uncertain as to whether the opponent is\na norm-follower. In this case the player is facing the following\nsituation\n (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nWith probability p, the opponent is a norm-following type,\nand with probability \\(1 - p\\) she is not. According to Bicchieri,\nconditional preferences imply that having a reason to be fair,\nreciprocate or cooperate in a given situation does not entail\nhaving any general motive or disposition to be fair, reciprocate or\ncooperate as such. Having conditional preferences means that one may\nfollow a norm in the presence of the relevant expectations, but\ndisregard it in its absence. Whether a norm is followed at a given\ntime depends on the actual proportion of followers, on the\nexpectations of conditional followers about such proportion, and on\nthe combination of individual thresholds.\n\nAs an example, consider a community that abides by strict norms of\nhonesty. A person who, upon entering the community, systematically\nviolates these norms will certainly be met with hostility, if not\nutterly excluded from the group. But suppose that a large group of\nthieves makes its way into this community. In due time, people would\ncease to expect honesty on the part of others, and would find no\nreason to be honest themselves in a world overtaken by crime. In this\ncase, probably norms of honesty would cease to exist, as the strength\nof a norm lies in its being followed by many of the members of the\nrelevant group (which in turn reinforces people\u2019s expectations\nof conformity).\n\nWhat we have discussed is a \u201crational reconstruction\u201d of\nwhat a social norm is. Such a reconstruction is meant to capture some\nessential features of norm-driven behavior; also, this analysis helps\nus distinguish social norms from other constructs such as conventions\nor personal norms. A limit of this account, however, is that it does\nnot indicate how such equilibria are attained or, in other terms, how\nexpectations become self-fulfilling.\n\nWhile neoclassical economics and game theory traditionally conceived\nof institutions as exogenous constraints, research in political\neconomy has generated new insights into the study of endogenous\ninstitutions. Specifically, endogenous norms have been shown to\nrestrict the individual\u2019s action set and drive preferences over\naction profiles (Bowles 1998; Ostrom 2000). As a result, the\n\u201cstandard\u201d economic framework positing exogenous (and in\nparticular self-centered) preferences has come under scrutiny. Widely\ndocumented deviations from the predictions of models with\nself-centered agents have informed alternative accounts of individual\nchoice (for one of the first models of \u201cinterdependent\npreferences\u201d, see Stigler & Becker 1977).\n\nSome alternative accounts have helped reconcile insights about\nnorm-driven behavior with instrumental rationality (Elster 1989b).\nMoreover, they have contributed to informing the design of laboratory\nexperiments on non-standard preferences (for a survey of early\nexperiments, see Ledyard 1995; more recent experiments are reviewed by\nFehr & Schmidt 2006 and Kagel & Roth 2016). In turn,\nexperimental findings have inspired the formulation of a wide range of\nmodels aiming to rationalize the behavior observed in the lab (Camerer\n2003; Dhami 2016).\n\nIt has been argued that the upholding of social norms could simply be\nmodeled as the optimization of a utility function that includes the\nothers\u2019 welfare as an argument. For instance, consider some of\nthe early \u201csocial preference\u201d theories, such as Bolton and\nOckenfels\u2019 (2000) or Fehr and Schmidt\u2019s (1999) models of\ninequity aversion. These frameworks can explain a good wealth of\nevidence on preferences for equitable income distributions; they\ncannot however account for conditional preferences like those\nreflecting principles of reciprocity (e.g., I will keep the common\nbathroom clean, if I believe my roommates do the same). As noted\nabove, the approach to social norms taken by philosophically-inclined\nscholars has emphasized the importance of conditional preferences in\nsupporting social norms. In this connection, we note that some of the\nsocial preference theories do account for motivations conditional on\nempirical beliefs, whereby a player upholds a principle of\n\u201cfair\u201d behavior if she believes her co-players will uphold\nit too (Rabin 1993; Dufwenberg & Kirchsteiger 2004; Falk &\nFischbacher 2006; Charness & Rabin 2002). These theories\npresuppose that players are hardwired with a notion of fair or kind\nbehavior, as exogenously defined by the theorist. Since they\nimplicitly assume that all players have internalized a\nunique\u2014exogenous\u2014normative standpoint (as reflected in\nsome notion of fairness or kindness), these theories do not explicitly\nmodel normative expectations. Hence, players\u2019\npreferences are assumed to be conditional solely on their empirical\nbeliefs; that is, preferences are conditional on whether others will\nbehave fairly (according to an exogenous principle) or not.\n\nThat said, we stress that social preferences should not be conflated\nwith social norms. Social preferences capture stable\ndispositions toward an exogenously defined principle of conduct\n(Binmore 2010). By contrast, social norms are better studied as\ngroup-specific solutions to strategic problems (Sugden 1986;\nBicchieri 1993; Young 1998b). Such solutions are brought about by a\nparticular class of preferences (\u201cnorm-driven\npreferences\u201d), conditional on the relevant set of empirical\nbeliefs and normative expectations. In fact, we stress that\n\u201cwhat constitutes fair or appropriate behavior\u201d often\nvaries with cultural or situational factors (Henrich et al. 2001;\nCappelen et al. 2007; Ellingsen et al. 2012). Accounting for\nendogenous expectations is therefore key to a full understanding of\nsocial norms.\n\nRelatedly, Guala (2016) offers a game-theoretic account of\ninstitutions, arguing that institutions are sets of rules in\nequilibrium. Guala\u2019s view incorporates insights from two\ncompeting accounts of institutions: institutions-as-rules (perhaps\nbest rendered by North 1990), and institutions-as-equilibria. From the\nfirst account, he captures the idea that institutions create rules\nthat help to guide our behaviors and reduce uncertainty. With rules in\nplace, we more or less know what to do, even in new situations. From\nthe second, he captures the idea that institutions are solutions to\ncoordination problems that arise from our normal interactions. The\ninstitutions give us reasons to follow them. The function of the\nrules, then, is to point to actions that promote coordination and\ncooperation. Because of the equilibrium nature of the rules, each\nindividual has an incentive to choose those actions, provided others\ndo too. Guala relies on a correlated equilibrium concept to unite the\nrules and equilibria accounts. On this picture, an institution is\nsimply a correlated equilibrium in a game, where other correlated\nequilibria would have been possible.\n\nThrasher (2018) offers a comparative-functional analysis of norms that\nbroadly aligns with the Bicchieri (2006) framework to help understand\nthe durability of \u201cbad norms.\u201d Abbink et al. (2017) use\npublic goods-like experiments to show how peer punishment can hold\ninefficient norms in place. This general framework can be helpful to\nunderstand why duels and honor killings can become stable (e.g.\nThrasher and Handfield 2018, Handfield and Thrasher 2019). This work\nexplores the signaling function of socially costly norms.\n\nAn alternative class of models explains norm compliance in terms of\nsocial image or self-image concerns (e.g., Andreoni and Bernheim 2009;\nB\u00e9nabou and Tirole 2006, 2011). These models assume that one\ntries to signal (to others or to one\u2019s future self) that one has\ngood \u201cpersonal traits\u201d, with such type-specific traits\nbeing imperfectly observed. More precisely, B\u00e9nabou and Tirole\n(2006) model the individual\u2019s utility from contributing to a\npublic good as a function of (i) material payoffs, (ii) intrinsic\nrewards from behaving altruistically, and (iii) reputational returns;\nin particular, the authors assume that reputational returns depend on\nthe observers\u2019 posterior expectations of the individual\u2019s\ntype. B\u00e9nabou and Tirole then consider (a refinement of)\nsignaling equilibria, thereby allowing for multiple solutions to occur\nas a result of the interplay of individual motivations and of the\nlevel of observability of the actions. While models with reputational\nconcerns do not explicitly define normative expectations, they\ngenerally posit that players care about their reputation under the\nassumption that acting altruistically is good or appropriate. Looking\nahead, there is still work to do to fully formalize the interplay of\n(endogenous) normative expectations and empirical beliefs within a\ngeneral model that is applicable to any game setting. Such a\nmodel should probably build on the \u201cpsychological game\ntheory\u201d framework (for discussion, see Battigalli and Dufwenberg\n2022, p. 857; see also Bicchieri and Sontuoso 2015).\n",
