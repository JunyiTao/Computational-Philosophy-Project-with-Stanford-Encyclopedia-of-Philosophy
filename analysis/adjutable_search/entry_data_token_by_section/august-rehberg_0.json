    "main_text": "Life, Reputation, and Influences\n1. Life, Reputation, and Influences\n\n In the few cases Rehberg has been recognized, his reputation has not\nbeen fairly assessed.  He has been described as \u201cnext to\nFriedrich Gentz, the ablest literary opponent of the French Revolution\nin\n Germany\u201d.[6]\n But such a tribute does not do him full\njustice, for the comparison should really be to the advantage of\nRehberg, who was politically wiser and philosophically deeper than\nGentz.  To some scholars, Rehberg has seemed a pale German imitation\nof Edmund Burke, whose Reflections on the Revolution in\nFrance became extremely popular in Germany in the early\n 1790s.[7]\n It has been indeed customary to stress the\nindebtedness of the Hannoverians to Burke, as if they were all his\nmere\n epigones.[8]\n Here again, though, Rehberg has been done\nan injustice.  He wrote his critique of the Revolution before Burke,\nand it is superior to Burke's in its philosophical content.  Although\nRehberg's writing has none of the rhetoric of Burke's, it makes up for\nits lack of style with greater substance.  Unlike Burke, Rehberg\nrealized that it was pointless to indulge in diatribe, no matter how\nflashy or brilliant, and that what was needed amid the passion and\npartisanship of revolutionary politics was sober and solid argument.\n\n Rehberg's early articles on the French Revolution, which were\npublished in the Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung, the most\nprominent journal of the day, quickly won him a national reputation.\nIn the early 1790s, when pro-revolutionary sentiment swept through\nGermany, Rehberg stood out as an articulate spokesman for the\nconservative cause.  He seemed to show that a case could be made for\nconservatism, that it was intellectually respectable to honor the\nhistorical traditions of the old German states.  Apart from the\nimmediate effect of his early articles, Rehberg's critique of the\nRevolution had a more lasting influence, and in two basic respects.\nFirst, by criticizing the abstract idealism of the radicals, and by\nstressing the importance of historical continuity for social and\npolitical stability, Rehberg made himself an important figure in the\ndevelopment of historicism.  Second, as the close friend of Karl von\nStein, the leader of the Prussian Reform movement, Rehberg's thinking\nhad a direct effect on the politics of his age.  Though Stein and\nRehberg later fell out, Stein always acknowledged his great debts to\n Rehberg.[9] \n\n Rehberg was born in 1757 into a middle class Protestant family.  His\nfather was a secretary for the estates of Calenberg, one of the\nduchies of Hannover.  Although Rehberg aspired to an academic career,\nhe was foiled in his ambitions.  A plan to get him a teaching post at\nthe Berlin Ritterakademie was thwarted by no less than\nFrederick the Great, who turned him down on the grounds that royal\npractice was to hire only cooks from Hannover.  After a humiliating\nfour years teaching German to Englishmen, he became in 1783 the\nsecretary to the Duke of York, who was then bishop of Osnabr\u00fcck.\nSo impressed was the Duke with Rehberg's abilities that he made him in\n1786 a secretary to the Hannoverian Geheime Ratskollegium (the\nsecret counsel).  The Ratskollegium consisted in aristocrats,\nthough its affairs were usually conducted by bourgeois secretaries\nlike Rehberg, who were denied any vote.  It was one of the tragedies\nof Rehberg's career that his onerous duties gave him little time for\nphilosophy. Hence his writings are scattered and occasional, and\nsometimes lack precision and polish.  For the same reason, he never\ngave a systematic exposition of his philosophy.  \n\n It was a striking curiosity of Rehberg's cultural milieu that his\nfather was a close friend of Johann Adolf Schlegel, the father of\nAugust Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel, two founding spirits of\nRomanticism.  The families would often meet, and so the little Rehberg\nwould often romp with the Schlegel kids.  As it happened, Rehberg's\nyounger sister Caroline became the first love of Friedrich Schlegel,\nwho immortalized her as Luise in his Lucinde. During one of\nthe family outings, Caroline sketched a drawing of the young Friedrich\nSchlegel, which now introduces the critical edition of his\n works.[10]\n If the Rehbergs inspired the Schlegels, the\nSchlegels did little for Rehberg.  Known for his dry, sober and\npuritanical temperament, Rehberg distrusted the self-indulgence and\nlibertinism of Romanticism.  He always kept his critical distance from\nRomanticism when it spread throughout Germany in the early 1800s.  The\nbest indicator of his attitude toward Romanticism is his review of\nsome of Adam M\u00fcller's writings, in which he deplored their\nmysticism and\n obscurantanism.[11] \n\n Rehberg's early interests were in philosophy and literature rather\nthan politics.  Intellectually precocious, he learned to read Greek,\nLatin, Italian, Spanish, French and English before he was fifteen.\nFrom 1774 to 1777 he attended the University of G\u00f6ttingen, then\none of the main centers of intellectual life in Germany.  Finding\nlittle inspiration from the Popularphilosophie then prevalent\nin G\u00f6ttingen, Rehberg resolved to educate himself, and did so by\nstudying Leibniz and Spinoza on his own.  One hallmark of Rehberg's\nintellectual character\u2014central for his philosophy and politics\u2014was\nhis skepticism, which he formed in his earliest years.  When he was\nonly fourteen, he had doubts about Christianity, and soon became an\nunbeliever, which he remained for the rest of his life.  His\nskepticism soon extended to metaphysics itself.  He had his doubts\nabout Leibniz and Spinoza, because their systems rested upon\nquestionable and indemonstrable first principles.  In 1779 he wrote an\nessay for a competition organized by the Berlin Academy, where he took\na skeptical position regarding metaphysics in\n general.[12]\n\nAlthough he argued that Leibniz's system was the best defense against\nSpinozism and skepticism, he also strongly suggested that it was by no\nmeans an adequate defense.  The only reason he defended Leibniz, he\nlater confessed, is that the Berlin Academy was dominated by\nLeibnizians, who would never have awarded a prize critical of their\n founder.[13]\n His real convictions were that Spinoza's\nsystem is the epitome of abstract thinking, though it suffers from\nirresolvable problems that demonstrate the inadequacies of all\n metaphysics.[14]\n\n\n Three philosophers had a formative influence on Rehberg's\nintellectual development. He greatly admired Hume, a favourite author\namong Hannoverian circles, for his\n skepticism.[15]\n It was\nfrom Hume that Rehberg most probably learned how skepticism could\nserve the cause of political conservatism.  Another crucial influence\nwas Justus M\u00f6ser, so-called advocatus patriae, famed\ndefender of the Kleinstaat and seminal influence on\nhistoricism.  When Rehberg did his apprenticeship as an Hannoverian\nbureaucrat, he was sent to Osnabr\u00fcck, where he met M\u00f6ser,\nwho soon became his \u201cfatherly friend\u201d.  It was M\u00f6ser\nwho taught him to appreciate the traditions and workings of the\nKleinstaat, \u201cthe basic principles of [German] civil\nsociety as they prevailed before the French\n Revolution\u201d.[16]\n Last but not least, Rehberg's\nskepticism was greatly abetted and strengthened by his study of Kant.\nAlthough his skepticism was already ripening in the late 1770s, before\nthe publication of the first Kritik, Kant greatly assisted\nRehberg in formulating his own\n skepticism.[17]\n He fully\nendorsed Kant's critique of rationalist metaphysics, accepted his\naccount of the limits of human knowledge, and greatly admired his\nmoral philosophy.  However, for reasons we shall soon see, he took\nissue with Kant's attempt to extend his moral philosophy into the\npolitical world.  \n",
