    "main_text": "Moral Disagreement and the Semantics (and Metasemantics) of Moral Language\n5. Moral Disagreement and the Semantics (and Metasemantics) of Moral Language\n\n\nThe previous sections address potential epistemological and\nmetaphysical implications of moral disagreement. However, it is also\nthought to be relevant to the fields of moral semantics and moral\nmetasemantics (which focus on questions about the meanings and\nfunctions of moral sentences and about the nature and contents of moral\nconvictions). Moral disagreements manifest themselves in disputes over\nsentences that involve terms such as \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cright\u201d and in differences regarding when and on what basis\nthose terms are to be applied. Since such patterns of language use\nbelong to the phenomena semantical and metasemantical theories seek to\naccount for, the disagreement has been taken to have relevance also in\nthose areas.\n\n\nMuch of that discussion focuses on a certain challenge against moral\nrealism, according to which it generates implausible implications about\nwhen people are in a genuine moral disagreement. Realism is supposed to\nhave those implications because of its commitment to cognitivism and\nabsolutism, and the challenge is accordingly offered of in support of\nnon-cognitivist or relativist views. However, the implications do not\nfollow from cognitivism or absolutism alone, but only given certain\nmetasemantical assumptions about how the truth conditions of moral\nsentences and the contents of moral beliefs are determined. So, an\nimportant question is if there are plausible assumptions of that kind\nwith which realists can combine their theory to avoid the\nimplications.\n",
