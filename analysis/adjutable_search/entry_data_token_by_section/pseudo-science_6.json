    "main_text": "The \u201cpseudo\u201d of pseudoscience || The objects of demarcation\n3.5 The objects of demarcation\n\nVarious proposals have been put forward on exactly what elements in\nscience or pseudoscience criteria of demarcation should be applied to.\nProposals include that the demarcation should refer to a research\nprogram (Lakatos 1974a, 248\u2013249), an epistemic field or\ncognitive discipline, i.e. a group of people with common knowledge\naims, and their practices (Bunge 1982, 2001; Mahner 2007), a theory\n(Popper 1962, 1974), a practice (Lugg 1992; Morris 1987), a scientific\nproblem or question (Siitonen 1984), and a particular inquiry (Kuhn\n1974; Mayo 1996). It is probably fair to say that demarcation criteria\ncan be meaningfully applied on each of these levels of description. A\nmuch more difficult problem is whether one of these levels is the\nfundamental level to which assessments on the other levels are\nreducible. However, it should be noted that appraisals on different\nlevels may be interdefinable. For instance, it is not an unreasonable\nassumption that a pseudoscientific doctrine is one that contains\npseudoscientific statements as its core or defining\nclaims. Conversely, a pseudoscientific statement may be characterized\nin terms of being endorsed by a pseudoscientific doctrine but not by\nlegitimate scientific accounts of the same subject area.\n\nDerksen (1993) differs from most other writers on the subject in\nplacing the emphasis in demarcation on the pseudoscientist, i.e. the\nindividual person conducting pseudoscience. His major argument for\nthis is that pseudoscience has scientific pretensions, and such\npretensions are associated with a person, not a theory, practice or\nentire field. However, as was noted by Settle (1971), it is the\nrationality and critical attitude built into institutions, rather than\nthe personal intellectual traits of individuals, that distinguishes\nscience from non-scientific practices such as magic. The individual\npractitioner of magic in a pre-literate society is not necessarily\nless rational than the individual scientist in modern Western society.\nWhat she lacks is an intellectual environment of collective\nrationality and mutual criticism. \u201cIt is almost a fallacy of\ndivision to insist on each individual scientist being\ncritically-minded\u201d (Settle 1971, 174).\n",
