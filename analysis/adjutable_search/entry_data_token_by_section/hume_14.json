    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy\n7. Moral Philosophy\n\nHume\u2019s explanation of morality is an important part of his\nefforts to reform philosophy. He takes his primary task to be an\ninvestigation into the origin of the basic moral ideas, which he\nassumes are the ideas of moral goodness and badness. As with the idea\nof cause and necessary connection, he wants to explain moral ideas as\neconomically as possible in terms of their \u201csimplest and fewest\ncauses\u201d. Determining their causes will determine what their\ncontent is\u2014what we mean by them. His secondary concern is to\nestablish what character traits and motives are morally good and\nbad.\n\nHume follows his sentimentalist predecessor, Francis Hutcheson\n(1694\u20131746), in building his moral theory around the idea of a\nspectator who approves or disapproves of people\u2019s character\ntraits and motives. The sentiments of approval and disapproval are the\nsource of our moral ideas of goodness and badness. To evaluate a\ncharacter trait as morally good is to evaluate it as virtuous; to\nevaluate it as morally bad is to evaluate it as vicious.\n\nAs he did in the causation debate, Hume steps into an ongoing debate\nabout ethics, often called the British Moralists debate, which began\nin the mid-seventeenth century and continued until the end of the\neighteenth. He uses the same method here as he did in the causation\ndebate: there is a critical phase in which he argues against\nhis opponents, and a constructive phase in which he develops\nhis version of sentimentalism. Hume has two sets of opponents: the\nself-love theorists and the moral rationalists. He became the most\nfamous proponent of sentimentalism.\n\nThomas Hobbes\u2019 (1588\u20131679) radical attempt to derive moral\nand political obligation from motives of self-interest initiated the\nBritish Moralists debate. Hobbes, as his contemporaries understood\nhim, characterizes us as naturally self-centered and power-hungry,\nconcerned above all with our own preservation. In the state of nature,\na pre-moral and pre-legal condition, we seek to preserve ourselves by\ntrying to dominate others. Since we are all sufficiently\n\u201cequal\u201d in power, this results in a state of \u201cwar of\nall against all\u201d in which life is \u201cnasty, brutish, and\nshort\u201d (Leviathan, Ch. 13). The way out is to make a\ncompact with one another. We agree to hand over our power and freedom\nto a sovereign, who makes the laws necessary for us to live together\npeacefully and has the power to enforce them. While acting morally\nrequires that we comply with the laws the sovereign establishes, the\nbasis of morality is self-interest.\n\nBernard Mandeville\u2019s (1670\u20131733) The Fable of the\nBees served to reinforce this reading of Hobbes during the early\n18th century. According to Mandeville, human beings are\nnaturally selfish, headstrong, and unruly. Some clever politicians,\nrecognizing that we would be better off living together in a civilized\nsociety, took up the task of domesticating us. Realizing that we are\nproud creatures, highly susceptible to flattery, they were able to\ndupe many of us to live up to the ideal of virtue\u2014conquering our\nselfish passions and helping others\u2014by dispensing praise and\nblame. Moral concepts are just tools clever politicians used to tame\nus.\n\nTwo kinds of moral theories developed in reaction first to Hobbes and\nthen to Mandeville\u2014rationalism and sentimentalism. The\nrationalists oppose Hobbes\u2019 claim that there is no right or\nwrong in the state of nature, that rightness or wrongness is\ndetermined by the sovereign\u2019s will, and that morality requires\nsanctions to motivate us. The sentimentalists object to Hobbes\u2019\nand Mandeville\u2019s \u201cselfish\u201d conceptions of human\nnature and morality. By the mid\u2013eighteenth century, rationalists\nand sentimentalists were arguing not only against Hobbes and\nMandeville, but also with each other.\n\nHume opposes both selfish and rationalist accounts of morality, but he\ncriticizes them in different works. In the Treatise, Hume\nassumes that Hobbes\u2019 theory is no longer a viable option, so\nthat there are only two possibilities to consider. Either moral\nconcepts spring from reason, in which case rationalism is correct, or\nfrom sentiment, in which case sentimentalism is correct. If one falls,\nthe other stands. In the second Enquiry, Hume continues to\noppose moral rationalism, but his arguments against them\nappear in an appendix. More importantly, he drops the assumption he\nmade in the Treatise and takes the selfish theories of Hobbes\nand Mandeville as his primary target. Once again, he thinks there are\nonly two possibilities. Either our approval is based in self-interest\nor it has a disinterested basis. The refutation of one is proof of the\nother.\n",
