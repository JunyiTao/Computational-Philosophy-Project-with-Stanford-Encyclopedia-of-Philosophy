    "main_text": "Contemporary Relevance || Philosophy of Health and Illness\n7.7 A New Generation\n\nBeyond its ascendency in the healing arts, its myriad cultural\ninfluences, and its wide-ranging impact on the humanities and social\nsciences, the enduring legacy of existentialism is perhaps most visible\nin the classroom. Existentialist-themed courses are often among the\nmost popular in the philosophy curriculum as young students confront,\nfor the first time, the unsettling questions of freedom and the meaning\nof their own existence. And these questions have never been more\npressing as they develop against the backdrop of anthropogenic climate\nchange, species extinction, global pandemics, and the reemergence of\nauthoritarian and fascist politics. Amidst these planetary emergencies,\na new generation is facing the predicament of nihilism and the death of\nGod and owning up to the uncanny truth of the human condition: that\nexistence precedes essence.\n",
