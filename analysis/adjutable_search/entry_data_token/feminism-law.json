It also considers problems at\nthe intersection of sexuality and law and develops reforms to correct\ngender injustice, exploitation, or restriction. To these ends,\nfeminist philosophy of law applies insights from feminist\nepistemology, relational metaphysics and progressive social ontology,\nfeminist political theory, and other developments in feminist\nphilosophy to understand how legal institutions enforce dominant\ngendered and masculinist norms. Contemporary feminist philosophy of\nlaw also draws from diverse scholarly perspectives such as\ninternational human rights theory, postcolonial theory, critical legal\nstudies, critical race theory, queer theory, and disability\nstudies.\n\nAddressing the goals of feminist philosophy of law requires theory\ndevelopment, conceptual analysis, and conceptual revision. Promoting\nfreedom and equality for women reflects a profound shift in basic\nassumptions about the nature of women and their proper place in the\nworld: a shift from inequality to equality of the sexes, along with\nre-examination of what equality itself requires. It also requires\nre-examination of the understanding of sex, gender, and gender roles.\nGiven the scope and detail of this change, feminist legal theory\nproceeds on multiple levels, from the pragmatic, concrete, and\nparticular to the conceptual and ultimately visionary. Some of this\nwriting appears in philosophy journals and monographs, but much also\nappears in journals in gender studies and feminism, generalist law\nreviews, and the many specialist law journals devoted to issues of\ngender and justice. This article begins with a brief overview of\nfundamental themes of feminist legal theory, followed by discussion of\nthe evolution of views about needed institutional changes in several\nsubstantive areas of law:  political equality, immigration, and\ncitizenship; marriage, reproductive rights, and commodification of the\nbody; protection from violence; and economic rights.\n", "toc": [{"#FunTheFemLeg": "1.

Fundamental Themes in Feminist Legal Philosophy\n\nIn philosophy of law, as in feminist theory more generally, methods,\npresumptions, and approaches vary considerably. Radical, socialist and\nMarxist, postcolonial, transnational, relational, cultural,\npostmodern, dominance, difference, pragmatist, liberal, and neoliberal\napproaches to feminism are all represented in and provide differing\ncontributions to feminist legal philosophy. Moreover, feminist legal\ntheory has developed over time, with concerns such as equality,\nliberty, dominance and difference, and diversity and globalization\nprevailing at different points (Chamallas 2003).\n\nDespite all these differences of focus, emphasis, or approach, certain\nthemes are common. Normative assumptions include the equal moral worth\nof all human beings (and perhaps of some non-human animals as well)\nand the entitlement of beings of such moral worth to equal treatment\nunder the law, however this might be understood. Feminist philosophers\nof law also share certain basic criticisms of traditional views of the\nnature of law and legal reasoning, of patriarchal assumptions as\nreflected in law, and of the problems that women have in securing\nequal justice under law (Smith, 1993, ch. 6). They are attuned to the\nways that power in society is shaped by the shortcomings of various\nlegal systems as well as to the complexities of improving these\nsystems, including how to decide the meaning of equal treatment under\nlaw and how it might be achieved. For example, feminist philosophers\nof law may disagree about the extent to which law should attempt to\nprevent dominance within intimate relationships and is complicit in\noppression if it does not. Neoliberal views emphasize liberty and\nconsent; criticisms of neoliberalism include the practical\ndifficulties of choice under circumstances of patriarchy or economic\nconstraints. To take another example, difference feminists and liberal\nfeminists struggle with the meaning of equality under law and whether\nachieving equality might in some circumstances require different\ntreatment.\n1.1 The Rule of Law\n\nMany standard accounts of the nature of law hold that law presumes and\nreflects a world-view in which the goal is to achieve a set of\npresumptively coherent and stable propositions.  Whether this aim\nis understood as \u201cthe rule of law\u201d (see, e.g., the entry\non\n Friedrich Hayek),\n as the \u201cinternal morality of law\u201d (see, e.g., the\ndiscussion of Fuller in the entry on\n natural law theories),\n or as \u201cthe soundest theory of the settled law\u201d (see,\ne.g., the discussion of Dworkin in the entry on\n interpretation and coherence in legal reasoning),\n or in other similar terms, legal systems embody comprehensive and\ngenerally long-standing conceptual systems. The coherence of any\nparticular legal system can always be challenged, but on this approach\nan aspiration of any legal system is coherence. And (at a minimum) the\nappearance or illusion of coherence is maintained by requirements of\nconsistency, including following precedent, treating like cases alike,\nand maintaining judicial impartiality.\n\nFeminist critics point out that conceptualizing the rule of law in\nterms of coherence and consistency tends to reinforce and legitimate\nthe status quo and existing power relationships (Scales 2006;\nMacKinnon 1989). Indeed, one primary purpose of law as traditionally\nunderstood is to promote stability and order by reinforcing adherence\nto predominant norms, representing them not only as the official\nvalues of a society, but even as universal, natural, and inevitable.\nLaw is thus seen as setting the official standard of evaluation for\nwhat is normal and accepted\u2014what is required, prohibited,\nprotected, enabled, or permitted. It is accordingly represented as\nobjective\u2014for example, as compelled by precedent and not just a\nmatter of opinion (see, e.g., MacKinnon 2006, 1989; Smith 2005, 1993;\nRhode 1997; Minow 1991). Violations, wrongs, injustices, harms, or\ninfractions are by definition deviations from law, and typically also\ndeviations from the status quo. The status quo is the invisible\ndefault standard of law. From these observations, feminist\nphilosophers of law have concluded that law makes systemic bias (as\nopposed to personal biases of particular individuals) invisible,\nnormal, entrenched, and thus difficult to identify and to oppose\n(Minow 1991; Rhode 1989; MacKinnon 1989). Such systemic bias may be\naccepted not only by actors within the legal system such as judges but\nalso by its victims as well as its beneficiaries. Primary tasks of\nfeminist philosophy of law are to identify such bias wherever it\noccurs within the legal system, through methodologies such as\ngenealogical analysis, conceptual analysis, or normative critique\n(e.g., Bartlett 1990; MacKinnon 1989).\n\nFeminist philosophers of law judge the status quo thus enforced as\npatriarchal, reflecting ancient and almost universal presumptions of\ngender inequality. This is not a conceptual necessity; law need not be\npatriarchal. Law does, however, reflect power relationships within\nsocieties. Throughout history, and in virtually every society, men and\nwomen have been viewed not only as different, but also as unequal in\nstatus and in power. Women were typically cast as opposites to men\nwithin an overarching set of dichotomies: men considered rational,\naggressive, competitive, political, dominating leaders; and women seen\nas emotional, passive, nurturing, domestic, subordinate followers.\nVersions of this set of assumptions have been widely and pervasively\nincorporated in long-standing institutions from politics and economic\narrangements to educational and religious institutions, to aesthetic\nstandards and personal relations\u2014and law is no exception\n(MacKinnon 2006, 1989; Smith 2005, 1993; Olsen 1983).\n1.2 Equality and Difference\n\nA central task of feminist philosophy of law is articulating what\nequality requires against this background of patriarchy; however,\nfeminists take differing approaches to this problem. For liberal\nfeminists, a primary task is achieving the principle of procedural\nequality articulated by Aristotle that like cases should be treated\nalike and different cases differently in proportion to their\ndifferences. For other feminists, this focus on procedural justice\nraises the question of whether there are differences between men and\nwomen that the law may justifiably take into account. For many\ncenturies men and women have been viewed as significantly different,\nand since they are different it has been thought appropriate and\njustified to treat them differently in law. Indeed, one of the reasons\nfor the entrenchment of sexual inequality is precisely the observation\nthat some differences between men and women are real: only women can\nbecome pregnant and bear children. Historically, feminists contend in\na variety of ways, such differences were greatly exaggerated, as was\ntheir significance and the extent to which they could be attributed to\nbiology rather than being socially constructed.\n\nFor feminist philosophers of law, an ongoing set of issues has\nconcerned which differences, if any, law may take into account\nconsistently with equal treatment. There are biological differences,\nsuch as pregnancy and birth. There are statistical differences: \nmen are taller and stronger; women have longer life expectancies.\nThere are historical differences:  women but not men have been\nsystematically subordinated because of their sex\u2014unable to vote,\nto own property, or to enter into legal contracts. Women are much more\nat risk to be raped. Women are much more likely to be responsible for\ncaregiving in the family. Women are likely to earn less for the same\nwork, and likely to be segregated in jobs that pay less than work that\nis male dominated. The feminist challenge is whether and how to\nacknowledge certain differences without entrenching stereotypes,\nreinforcing detrimental customs, promoting sexist socialization, or\nincurring backlash (Rhode 1997; Minow 1991)\u2014and without\ncompromising equality.\n\nThis challenge identifies \u201cdilemmas of difference\u201d (Minow\n1991), which occur when a decision is based on unstated norms that\npresume the status quo as universal and inevitable when in fact these\nnorms reflect a particular point of view. The structure of a\ndifference dilemma is this:  there is a difference, such as that\nonly women become pregnant or that an employer has a history of\nrefusing to promote women. Taking this difference into account seems\nrequired for equal treatment: otherwise, women will face disadvantages\nthat men will not. But taking this difference into account also seems\nto instantiate unequal treatment, giving women special benefits (time\noff work, fast-track promotions) men do not have. So it seems there is\nno way to achieve equality in the face of differences such as\nthese.\n\nCountering a difference dilemma requires undermining the way the issue\nwas initially formulated (more accurately, mal-formulated). \nFeminist critics of the view that pregnancy leave is a special\nbenefit, for example, point out that the only way these benefits can\nbe judged special is if the norm against which they are being\nevaluated is male. If the standard was female, or even human, such\nbenefits could not be considered special (or even unusual) since they\nare far more commonly needed than, say, benefits for a broken leg, or\nprostate cancer (neither of which are considered special benefits).\nThe underlying male standard is invisible because it is traditional\nfor most workplaces, and pregnancy leave would require a change to\nthese norms; but in the view of feminist critics, this underlying\nstandard needs to be exposed as male because in fact it is not equal.\n(Rhode 1997; Minow 1991)  Once male norms are recognized as only\nthat\u2014male norms\u2014the presumption of difference must be\ncorrected. If the need for correction is taken seriously, then legal\nrecognition of difference cannot by itself imply unequal treatment. An\nassertion of difference is a factual assessment. Equality is a\npolitical (or moral) standard. One does not automatically follow from\nthe other. Thus formulation of the debate in terms of sameness or\ndifference must be transcended by understanding equality. (Smith 2005;\nRhode 1997; Minow 1991).\n1.3 Reasonableness in Law\n\nLegal standards of reasonableness are another area where feminist\nphilosophers of law strive to reveal male norms. In areas of the law\nfrom criminal law (would a reasonable person believe that the threat\nof harm was sufficient to require the use of force in self-defense?)\nto tort law (did the defendant exercise reasonable care?) to contract\nlaw (what are reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing?) to\nemployment discrimination (was she reasonably offended by the conduct\nof others at work?), reasonableness standards play a major role in\nlaw. Traditionally, the standard was that of the average reasonable\nman, a formulation that overtly indicated its gendered nature. Today,\nthe standard is more likely to be formulated as that of a reasonable\nperson, but feminists continue to demonstrate how this standard\nreflects male norms. A particular area of current controversy is\ninteractions with the police, where feminists join with many others\nsuch as the Black Lives Matter movement or disability rights groups to\nreveal the biases in what is judged reasonable for police to do and\nwhat responses to police conduct are thought to be reasonable (Cuevas\nand Jacobi 2016). Feminists have also proposed the standard of an\naverage reasonable woman, which achieved one success in court,\n Ellison v. Brady,\n 924 F.2d 872 (9th Cir. 1991). However, the presence of a\nseparate legal standard may be criticized as unfair or as fragmenting\nthe law into a variety of subjective perspectives\u2014although this\nconclusion is also subject to critique as an illustration of the\ndifference dilemma. More recent feminist attention has been directed\ntowards de-legitimating masculinist perspectives of reasonableness and\nachieving equality in the understanding of reasonableness (Chamallas\n2010). Areas of law such as tort (Chamallas and Wriggins 2010) and\ncontract (Threedy 2010) have been reassessed as reflecting bias in\ntheir structure, the types of claims they recognize, their\nunderstanding of injury, and the compensation they provide. To\nsummarize, a persistent theme in feminist philosophy of law is\nuncovering how masculinist, ableist, or white norms are reflected in\nlaw.\n1.4 Public and Private\n\nAnother central theme in feminist philosophy of law is the viability\nof the public/private distinction. For liberals, including liberal\nfeminists, there remains a domain of private life that should be\nreserved for individual choice.  Radical feminists raise the\nconcerns that patriarchy and sexual dominance pervade private\nrelationships and there are no clear lines to be drawn between actions\nthat primarily affect the individual and actions that affect others\nmore broadly. Legal structures that permit or reinforce dominance\nwithin intimate relationships are thus deeply problematic and must be\noverturned. One area where this debate has taken shape among feminists\nis the law of prostitution (see the discussion in the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex markets);\n some liberals claim that when prostitution is fully voluntary, it\nshould be legally permitted, and the role of law is to prohibit\ncoercive forms of the practice. Other feminists argue that legalized\nprostitution simply allows sex trafficking to flourish in its shadow\n(Dempsey 2010) or more comprehensively that paid sex can never be\nfully voluntary (Miriam 2005). Other continuing areas of theoretical\nexploration among feminists are the weight and scope to be given to\nany distinction between the public and the private in reproduction,\nfamily structures, work arrangements, sexual relationships, domestic\nviolence, and the like; these issues are discussed further in later\nsections of this essay. \n1.5 Human Rights\n\nHuman rights theory is another central area of concern for feminist\nphilosophers of law. By the end of the 20th century many\nsocieties had officially rejected sexual inequality in law, at least\nas a matter of basic human rights. Human rights are now said to apply\nequally to women and equal protection of the law is seen as applying\nequally to men and women (United Nations Convention on the Elimination\nof All Forms of Discrimination Against Women [CEDAW] 1979). Feminists\nhail these developments but remain concerned that in many societies\ncommitments to human rights are shallow and laws reflecting\npatriarchal environments and cultures continue to thrive and flourish.\n\n\nIn addition, some feminists are directly critical of the role of\nrights. Feminists associated with the critical legal studies movement,\nfor example, see rights as potentially masking underlying\nrelationships of power and domination (Scales 1986). Other feminists,\nsuch as those associated with critical race theory, voice concerns\nthat dominance feminists assume an essentialism that silences the\nvoices of African-American women (Harris 1990) and that rights may\nprovide crucial protection to victims of discrimination and oppression\n(Williams 1992). Similar debates concern rights in international law\nwith liberal feminists defending the gains achieved through the\ninternational recognition of human rights and critical theorists\njoining with some third world feminists to decry the structural bias\nof international law and the role of rights in continuing to mask\noppression (Engle 2005; Otto 2005). \n1.6 Multiple Methodologies\n\nMethodologically, feminist philosophy of law draws a great deal from\nfeminist work in other areas of philosophy and has broken new ground\nas well. Feminist\n epistemological accounts\n of epistemic injustice and the social nature of knowledge are\nespecially salient to many questions about and within law (McKinnon\n2016). Trials, after all, depend on testimony. Fricker (2007)\nconsiders both testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice.\nTestimonial injustice occurs when people are discounted as credible\nbecause of stereotypes such as those rooted in sex or race; it may\nalso occur when people are assessed as overly credible for similar\nreasons, likely to the detriment of the credibility accorded others\n(Medina 2013). For example, a woman\u2019s testimony may be\ndiscounted in allegations of rape in the face of her assailant\u2019s\nclaim of consent. To take another example, claims of asylum seekers\nabout threats they face in their home countries may be disbelieved.\nHermeneutical injustice occurs when others do not even have the\nconcepts to understand what someone is saying, as when a victim of sex\ntrafficking claims she was coerced but police or immigration\nauthorities can only visualize her as an economic migrant. Work of\nAfrican-American feminists such as Dotson (2011) present especially\npowerful accounts of race-based epistemic injustice. An additional\nillustration of the importance of feminist epistemology is the\ndevelopment of understanding of first person standpoints. This work\nhas informed discussions of victim protection, for example (Schroeder\n1991).\n\nWork in relational metaphysics has helped in analysis of how legal\ninstitutions should reflect connections among people, including care\nrelationships (McClain 1992; West 1988). Many feminist writers in this\ntradition have taken pains to distance themselves from simplistic\nessentialist assumptions about the way women think or the role of\nwomen as caregivers, emphasizing instead the importance of context to\nunderstanding. Feminist theory has inspired and deployed new forms of\nlegal realism\u2014the view that law reflects its social\ncontext\u2014to criticize the frequent formalism of approaches to law\nin terms of economic relationships and rational choice (Nourse &\nShaffer 2009). Feminist scholarship on human rights\u2014viewed in\nthe abstract as universal\u2014has also emphasized the importance of\nlived experiences in context (Halley et al. 2006). Debate about\nwhether all forms of prostitution should be prohibited, or whether\nthere is room for a liberal view that would distinguish coerced\ntrafficking from voluntary sex work, is but one illustration of such\nscholarship. Legal archaeology, understood as exploration of cases in\ntheir full context, is a method developed by Threedy (2010) and others\nfor criticizing the formalism of much legal analysis and revealing the\nextent to which gendered norms permeate legal doctrines such as\ndefenses in contract law. Feminists interested in criticizing\nparadigms of rationality and breaking down supposed divisions between\nreason and emotion have questioned whether there is a too-ready\nwillingness to reject emotions in supposedly non-gendered contexts\nsuch as the law of evidence where the rules are constructed to\neliminate appeals to emotion as irrelevant\u2014but a too-ready\nacceptance of emotion in contexts where women are stereotyped and\ndisadvantaged, as with the Supreme Court\u2019s assertion that the\nstate has an interest in protecting women from partial birth abortion\nbecause they might later come to regret their decisions (Abrams &\nKeren 2010).\n\nIntersectionality theory is an especially important recent development\nin feminist methodology of relevance to philosophy of law. Feminists\nusing an analysis of intersections between race, sex, and other\nidentity categories discern essentialist tendencies that gloss the\ncomplexities of identity in the work of both radical and liberal\nfeminists (Crenshaw 2012, Harris 1990). Intersectionality theorizes\nhow locations in multiple socially constructed categories such as\ngender, race, class, or disability affect how people live (Jones 2013,\nHaslanger 2012). Theorizing without intersectionality made women of\ncolor and other multiply oppressed people invisible; keeping\ncategories such as race and sex separate made it more difficult to\nachieve justice for persons who were multiply oppressed.\nIntersectionality creates interlocking and superimposed axes of\nprivilege or disadvantage (Haslanger 2012). An illustration can be\nfound in ways that prison violence arguably tracks intersections\nbetween vulnerability and identity categories, with images of female\nvulnerability both reinforcing sexist thinking and contributing to the\noppression inflicted by the racist carceral state (Gilson 2016). \n2. Formal Equality and Equal Citizenship\n\nThe mid-twentieth century women\u2019s movement\u2014so-called\nsecond wave feminism\u2014began as a liberation movement (see the\nentry on\n feminist political philosophy).\n The idea was that women are entitled to be free and equal\ncitizens\u2014as free as men to participate in their societies, to\npursue their ambitions and determine their own lives. A starting place\nfor achieving equal citizenship was political equality. Despite the\nfacts that political equality had been defended by the Seneca Falls\nConvention in 1848 and by and\n Harriet Taylor Mill\n in the \u201cEnfranchisement of Women\u201d in 1851, and that\nwomen\u2019s suffrage had been achieved in the United States and in\nmany other countries by the early 20th century, at\nmid-century political equality remained a radical idea that led to\nsome radical legal reform. And it remains a deeply contested concept\nnearly 75 years later.\n\nWhile the basic right to political equality is taken for granted in\nmany societies today and is explicit in the norms of international law\n(CEDAW 1979), in some cultures women are still not equal citizens.\nSome are unable to vote, hold office, attend school, engage in\nbusiness, or travel about freely. Some do not control their own\nreproductive lives, access to their bodies, the opportunity to pursue\nany life ambition other than marriage, or who their marriage partner\nwill be. Some women have little control over any major decisions about\ntheir lives. In some societies they are banned by law from making all\nor some such decisions, and thereby are rendered dependent on those\nwho can. \n\nOne of the most fundamental goals of global feminist jurisprudence is\nto oppose and reform barriers to women\u2019s participation in the\npublic sphere. The basic premise is that unequal citizenship\nconstitutes second-class status that cannot be justified. Equal\ncitizenship is a presumptive value in the modern world.\nProblematically, in law the burden of justification typically lies\nwith the reformer and precedent favors the status quo (MacKinnon\n2006).\n\nInternational recognition of human rights has been particularly\nimportant as a means to achieve equal citizenship. Feminist legal\nscholars have been pursuing issues of women\u2019s human rights\ninternationally for many years, at least since the United Nations was\nofficially formed in 1945. CEDAW, adopted in 1979, sets the\ninternational human rights standard against gender discrimination.\nEspecially since the 1980s, these efforts have been aided by mass\ncommunication, international travel, and the Internet (Rhode &\nSanger, 2004). International conferences have promoted dialogue and\nexchange of ideas on issues ranging from honor killing to labor law.\nSome international groups (both NGOs and government-sponsored) are\nspecifically focused on (what are often called) women\u2019s issues,\nsuch as violence against women and girls, women\u2019s economic\nviability, or women\u2019s health and reproductive issues (see, e.g.,\nthe links in the Other Internet Resources Section to CRLP, Futures\nwithout Violence, Gendercide Watch, Human Rights Watch, National\nNetwork to End Domestic Violence, Wild for Human Rights, and\nWomenWatch). The collection of data by social scientists is more\naccurate and inclusive than ever in history, thus providing better\nfoundations for analysis. Finally, collaborative research and\ncomparative analysis of diverse legal systems and social customs have\nbeen increasing for at least thirty years, and in virtually every\nsociety more women are available to engage in these efforts and more\nmen have become interested in them (see Jain 2005; Rhode & Sanger\n2005; Stark 2004; Sen 1995; Peters & Wolper 1995)\n\nBeyond equal citizenship, feminist jurisprudence also criticizes legal\nor political structures that would put disproportionate burdens on\nwomen or children seeking to live or to become citizens in countries\nother than their country of origin. Here, feminists reveal how asylum\nor refugee policies may be based on male models of what constitutes\npersecutions, discounting forms of structural injustice that\ndisproportionately burden women (e.g. Parekh 2012; Freedman 2008).\n\nThe cumulative result of these efforts has been to globalize both the\nissues and the approaches to them. Providing a global perspective\nencourages conditions favorable to the conceptual revision needed for\nlegal reform. As nations join and sign international conventions and\ntreaties that increasingly include rights for women, feminists are\nsupplied with a foundation from which to argue that local laws must\ncomply with these international commitments. For example, signing the\nDeclaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women implies that\na nation is committed to enacting and enforcing laws against violence\ntoward women. Ratifying the U.N. Declaration of Political and Civil\nRights implies that a nation is committed at a minimum to universal\nsuffrage and more generally to equal citizenship. Becoming a state\nparty to CEDAW affirms support for equal human rights and for\nelimination of all forms of discrimination against women. Although a\nnumber of states expressed reservations in their acceptance of CEDAW,\nthe US did not. Thus, international law and treaty commitments can be\nused to argue for national or local legal reform (Schneider 2004;\nPeters & Wolper 1995).\n\nYet even if the goal of stated legal equality is achieved, law\nprovides no protection unless it is enforced. Feminist legal critics\nhave argued that laws and treaties that exist on paper frequently are\nignored in fact when they apply to women and contradict local customs\nand beliefs (Husseini 2007; MacKinnon 2006). An additional concern is\nthat formal acceptance of treaties may mask failures to implement\ntreaty requirements (Hathaway 2005)\n\nMoreover, the meaning of equal citizenship beyond equal political\nparticipation remains contested. An initial liberal feminist approach\nwas to argue strictly for formal equality, that is, to deny that any\nsexual difference was ever relevant to legal doctrine. This strategy,\noften called the assimilation model, was an effective strategy for\nchallenging overt legal restrictions on women and legally enforced\nexclusion (Taub & Williams 1993; Smith 1993; Bartlett &\nKennedy 1991). For example, in the US feminist lawyers argued\nsuccessfully that statutes treating women differently for purposes\nsuch as estate administration or age of majority violated\nconstitutional equal protection, following the initial lead of Ruth\nBader Ginsburg as director of the ACLU Women\u2019s Rights Project in\n Reed v. Reed\n (404 U.S. 71 (1971)). At its most comprehensive, this was the\napproach of US feminists seeking passage of the unsuccessful Equal\nRights Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution, an amendment that would\nhave put sex on the same fundamental legal footing as race.\n\nAchievement of equal citizenship viewed as the removal of explicit\nlegal barriers leaves open whether equality requires more. Even in the\nUnited States, much legal room remains for continuing controversy. The\neffort to establish full constitutional equal protection through the\nERA foundered on assertions that differences matter to issues as\ndiverse as military service, child support, or bathroom utilization\n(Mayeri 2011; Frug 1992).   This argument fueled\nconservative opposition to the ERA, but these issues were raised in\ndifferent forms for feminists as well.  Feminists emphasizing\nclass differences and labor rights were concerned that hard-won\nbenefits for women could be jeopardized. Critical race theorists were\nconcerned that formal equality for women failed to understand the\ncomplex intersectionality of discrimination against women of color\n(Mayeri 2011). Critics of patriarchy insisted that histories of\ndiscrimination were central to understanding the functioning of male\nnorms in social institutions from the family to employment to\npolitical structures. At present, in US constitutional law what equal\nprotection requires when sex is a category has not been modeled on the\nstrict scrutiny accorded race as a category; sexual differences\nconcretized in law must only pass a level of heightened scrutiny as to\ntheir rationale to garner constitutional acceptance.\n\nAcross the globe, there are similar debates about what more is\nrequired beyond formal equality of citizenship. CEDAW\u2019s (1979)\nrequirement for the elimination of \u201call forms\u201d of\ndiscrimination against women has been a framework for these debates\n(IWRAW-AP 2012). These debates are complicated, however, by concerns\nthat at least certain ways of understanding human rights norms\nincorporate so-called western values and are incompatible with\nlegitimate cultural differences. Whether theories of rights can be\nformulated in a manner that accommodates cultural differences has been\ngiven considerable attention by feminist political philosophers\n(Mookherjee 2009; Ackerly 2008) and is centrally relevant to the\nunderstanding of international human rights norms and their role in\nlaw.\n3. Marriage, Reproductive Rights, and Commodification of the Body\n\nNowhere than in marriage is the legal bias towards the status quo more\napparent. Yet in many jurisdictions across the globe, same sex\nmarriage is now legally recognized. The U.S. Supreme Court held in\n Obergefell v. Hodges\n that prohibitions of same sex marriage violate constitutional\nguarantees of due process and equal protection (576 U.S. ___ (2015)).\nLiberal feminists and many others have hailed this decision as a\nsignificant victory. Nonetheless, concerns remain about the\ndecision\u2019s scope. In many jurisdictions, a couple\u2019s\nmarriage may be protected but they will not be protected against\ndecisions of their employer to fire them or of their landlord to evict\nthem. It is also unclear whether people will be able to refuse them\nservices on religious grounds; the Supreme Court will decide this\nissue during its 2017-2018 term.\n\nStill further critics argue that extension of marriage to same sex\ncouples merely entrenches a fundamentally inegalitarian relationship.\nThe view that equality requires extending the institution of marriage\nto same-sex partners, if it is to be available to opposite-sex\npartners, is a liberal view. In the eyes of critics of liberal\nmarriage, marriage itself must be rethought, if gendered inequalities\nare to be overcome (Brake 2014). Valorizing marriage also potentially\nharms those whose relationships take other, less valued forms, such as\nasexual relationships, polyamorous relationships, or care networks\n(Brake 2014). To the extent that marriage institutionalizes\nproblematic forms of dominance, it would seem a mistake to extend it\nat all\u2014or at least to extend it without significant substantive\nchanges in the institution (Kim 2010). Assimilationist paradigms both\nrecognize the pain of exclusion but fail to problematize the role\nmarriage plays in institutionalizing inequality (Robson 2002).\n\nReproductive autonomy is another particularly telling example of the\nongoing force of gender norms. Feminists plausibly contend that women\ncannot be free and equal citizens if they do not control their own\nbodies. Much feminist research has detailed the history and debated\nthe implications of current laws and policies that have allowed or\nconstrained women\u2019s reproductive freedom (see, e.g., Peach 2002;\nRhode 1997). Paternalistic attitudes towards women have been\nidentified as shaping the structure of the Supreme Court\u2019s\n Roe v. Wade\n (410 U.S. 113 (1973)) decision and subsequent efforts by states to\nregulate or restrict abortion in the name of protecting women\u2019s\nhealth (Appleton 2011; Laufer-Ukeles 2011). Even feminists who\npersonally oppose abortion, or who are critical of some abortions\n(e.g., those evidencing disability discrimination) typically argue\nthat abortion should still be legal. Some argue that controlling\none\u2019s own body is a necessary condition for any other freedom\n(see, e.g., Peach 2002; Estrich 2001; Rhode 1997; Olsen 1993). Yet\ntogether with paternalistic attitudes about the need to protect women\nfrom their emotionality and irrationality in the reproductive process,\ntraditional views of women\u2019s reproductive roles have shaped law\nand policy. Laws permitting abortion remain under attack; many U.S.\njurisdictions now have laws targeting abortion providers (TRAP laws),\nalthough in\n Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt\n (579 U.S. ___ (2016)) the U.S. Supreme Court struck down\nTexas\u2019s TRAP laws as impermissibly burdening women\u2019s\nrights without providing corresponding benefit for women\u2019s\nhealth. Feminists point out that analyses of whether such statutes\nplace undue burdens on women\u2019s rights in terms of formal legal\nbarriers manifest legal formalism that conceals the reality of ongoing\noppression or inequality of opportunity. The Hellerstedt\ndecision rejected such formalism in favor of an analysis of the actual\nbenefits and burdens of the Texas laws by a slim 5\u20133 majority\nafter Justice Scalia\u2019s death, but with the addition of Justice\nGorsuch one further appointment to the Court could tip this\nbalance.\n\nThe abortion issue also raises questions about how law should deal\nwith issues of deep moral disagreement within society. In the United\nStates, the protection of women\u2019s reproductive freedom from\nrestriction by government was initially based on the right to privacy\nand is now understood in terms of liberty. First applied to\nreproduction in the 1965 case of\n Griswold v. Connecticut\n (381 US 479 (1965)), the constitutional right to privacy was\nunderstood to protect individuals from state interference with certain\ndecisions affecting their private lives, particularly decisions about\nmarriage, family, sexual intimacy, and procreation. Griswold\nwas jurisprudentially controversial because the right to privacy is\nnot explicitly stated in the Constitution. Feminists have argued that\noriginalist approaches to constitutional interpretation that would\nrestrict constitutional meaning to the understandings in place at the\ntime constitutional provisions were adopted are jurisprudentially\nproblematic in their entrenchment of the norms of the patriarchy of\nthe day (e.g. Case 2014) More recent decisions about abortion rights\nhave been framed in terms of fundamental liberties that may not be\nunduly burdened (e.g.,\n Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey\n (505 U.S. 833 (1992))).\n\nOn the other side of the abortion debate from women\u2019s\nreproductive liberty is the question of the fetus. Roe v.\nWade\u2019s extension of the right to privacy to a woman\u2019s\ndecision to terminate a pregnancy by elective abortion set off a\nfirestorm of protest and debate that remains robust over forty years\nlater. Even the language used to state the issues is contested.\nLabeling the fetus a \u201cpre-born infant\u201d or a\n\u201cperson\u201d\u2014as some of the attempts to pass so-called\npersonhood amendments have tried to do\u2014begs exactly the question\nof what if any moral claims the fetus might have (e.g. Francis, ed.\n2017, part IV). Many feminists hold nuanced views on these questions.\nFor example, disability rights feminists may argue that while abortion\nrights should be protected, abortion decisions that are based on\ninadequate or biased information about disabilities are problematic.\nBlack feminists may interrogate whether abortion policies or support\nfor women and families are racially biased, implicitly or even\nexplicitly. Many feminists also agree that the state has an interest\nin protecting the fetus to the extent that it will be born\nalive\u2014that is, that the state has an interest in protecting\ncontinuing pregnancies against fetal harm, including harm inflicted by\nthe pregnant woman herself\u2014although feminists also recognize\nthat this interest must not be seen to legitimize problematic coercive\nor paternalistic interferences with pregnant women\u2019s\nliberty.\n\nIn its more recent cases the US Supreme Court has held that the state\ninterest in protecting potential life may begin at the moment of\nconception even though the mother\u2019s interest outweighs it\n (Planned Parenthood v. Casey,\n 505 US 833 (1992)). The Court\u2019s continuing jurisprudence bears\nout initial feminist concerns that saw this formulation as the tip of\na wedge (e.g. Peach 2002). For example, the 2007 decision of\n Gonzales v. Carhart\n (550 U.S. 124 (2007)) upheld the constitutionality of the Partial\nBirth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. The Act bans what it terms partial\nbirth abortion\u2014language freighted with the imagery of a\nlive-born person\u2014except when necessary to save the life of the\nmother. In the decision, the Court weighed substantial state interests\nin protecting the health of the mother and in preserving fetal life as\ninterests present all along during pregnancy against the burden placed\non the woman\u2019s right of reproductive liberty. Opponents of the\nAct claimed that its partial birth label concealed the extent of its\nrestriction on pre-viability abortion choices. The decision has\nspurred state efforts to enact the TRAP laws described above. These\nstate statutes have placed increasing burdens on abortion providers;\nmany have closed and abortion is practically unavailable for women in\nmany areas of the United States despite the Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. \n\nFeminists also criticize the US Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in\nsupport of the state interest in protecting potential life. One\nconcern is the scope of the supposed interest, such as whether it\nextends to the sale or distribution of contraceptive devices that\nprevent implantation after fertilization, or that even are claimed to\ndo so in rare cases. Another concern is how any interest in protecting\nfetal life from the moment of conception can be supported in a\nsecular, liberal state. If the answer is that there is some special\nstatus accorded to the human embryo or fertilized egg that requires\nits protection from the moment it is fertilized, feminists argue, this\nis best characterized as a religious view. If so, religious beliefs\nare being imported into state laws and the US Constitution that have a\ndisproportionate impact upon women. The vague references to protecting\npotential life, so central to all the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions\non this complex issue, obscure these critical implications and are\nproblematic on many grounds. Even in a modern, secular, liberal state\nthat is explicitly committed to individual freedom, women\u2019s\nfundamental liberties can be obscured and mystified by language and\naction that uphold and impose longstanding restrictive modes of\nthought and custom that may not always be recognized as religious in\norigin but that have no other plausible explanation. Such restrictions\nare often expressed in and defended by the use of religious language\n(such as sacred-ness or sanctity) that is applied to controversial\nreligious doctrines as though they were settled, basic and\nuncontroversial. \n\nSome societies explicitly incorporate religious law into their legal\nsystems, operate dual systems, or are expressly theocratic. Others are\nsecular but faced with strong customary elements. To some extent all\nsocieties face the problem of customary resistance to reform, as\nillustrated by the abortion debates in the United States. In nations\nwith strong religious or customary influences on law, feminists may\nface difficult issues of how to interpret religious law into language\nmore favorable to women\u2019s freedom, how to call upon\ninternational human rights norms, and/or how to interpret the language\nof customary law in a way that enables it to absorb feminist reforms\nover time (Quriashi 2011). This is a special case of the general\nproblem of entrenchment. It may involve several different ways of\nchallenging the religious establishment on matters of interpretation\nthat are (traditionally) considered settled or fundamental. Some\ncustomary doctrines arguably have no particular basis in religious\ntexts, although they are treated as though they do (e.g., when life\nbegins). Furthermore, some doctrines have a very general religious\nbasis (e.g., women should be modest) but are interpreted to require\nfar more severe or detailed customs (e.g., women must be entirely\ncovered whenever they are in public). A further strategy points out\nthat all religious interpretation is selective, so it must be\ndetermined whether a passage of text should be considered basic and\neternal, or whether it was simply a reflection of particular customs\nor attitudes relevant to a particular time in history (e.g., adultery\nand blasphemy are capital offenses). Some innovative work has been\ndone on these issues, for example, by exploring the distinction\nbetween shari\u2019a (eternal) law and fiqh (custom\nor jurisprudence) in Islam, and by considering the interplay of dual\nsystems (Quriashi 2011; Mir-Hosseini 2005; Reed & Pollitt 2002;\nJeffrey & Basu 1998). These approaches emphasize interpretive\nmethods; a further approach calls on the separation between law and\nmorality endorsed by legal positivism to disentangle traditionalist\nmoral beliefs from the requirements of law.\n\nSince the adoption under the Affordable Care Act of the requirement\nthat contraception methods approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration be included in group health plans without cost-sharing,\nmany have voiced religious objections to providing this coverage.\nFeminists argue that contraceptive use declines with costs and that\nready access to contraception is an important part of women\u2019s\nability to control their bodies. They also point out how the burdens\nof contraception and contraceptive failure fall on women rather than\nmen. Objectors contend that contraception should be a matter of\nprivate choice rather than a government requirement, that at least\nsome contraceptives are problematic as abortifacients (although this\ncontention is contested for contraceptive methods such as the\nintrauterine device), and that rights of conscientious objection\nshould be respected. Here, too, philosophy of law considers the role\nof law in resolving these disputes.\n\nCommodification of the body especially in reproduction is a topic of\nextensive discussion among feminist philosophers of law. As\nreproductive technologies have become increasingly sophisticated,\npressures for women to sell their oocytes or to be paid to bear\nchildren for others have mounted. Some liberal theorists urge that if\npaid sex, paid surrogacy, paid gamete donation, and the like can be\nachieved voluntarily, these are legitimate forms of economic\nopportunity. To prohibit them is to deprive some\npeople\u2014primarily women\u2014of opportunities that might be of\nvalue to them and to deprive the biologically and the socially\ninfertile of the ability to form families. Indeed, if all forms of\nsexuality, including marriage, were viewed on the model of economic\nrelationships, some argue, equality for women would be furthered \n(Ertman 2001).  Feminists critical of this liberal position argue\nthat commodification may misperceive the nature of the body in human\nlife by understanding it as the subject of property\u2014despite the\nall-too-apparent reality that alternatives to commodification may be\nworse (Radin 1996). Relatedly, some contend that commodification of\nthe body in practices such as paid surrogacy is inherently\nexploitative (Dickenson 2007).\n\nMany liberal feminists, too, are opposed to a variety of\ncommodification practices. Some argue that abolition of even voluntary\nprostitution is necessary to protect victims of sex trafficking, as\nlegalized prostitution may mask continued flourishing of trafficking\nin its shadow (Dempsey 2010). Others are concerned about the\npossibility of genuinely voluntary consent in circumstances of poverty\nor limited opportunities for many women. Several countries that have\nlegalized prostitution, such as the Netherlands and Germany, have\nengaged in vigorous debates about whether legal prostitution is a\nvoluntarily chosen occupation for many, whether legalization has\nbettered the circumstances for prostitutes, and whether legalization\nhas been coupled with enhanced enforcement of laws against sex\ntrafficking or other sex crimes. Other countries, such as Sweden, have\nbanned prostitution altogether, spurred by feminist critique of the\npractice. \n\nRelated to the concerns about commodification of the body are\ncriticisms of what are seen as questionable technological imperatives,\neven apart from the economic incentives that may be driving them. Some\nfeminists contend that practices such as pre-implantation genetic\ndiagnosis, transplants of mitochondrial DNA, or gene editing are far\nriskier both physiologically and ethically than proponents admit (e.g.\nDe Melo-Martin 2016). These feminists point out that long-term\nevidence of safety is lacking and that there may be unanticipated\ndeleterious consequences of these techniques. These practices may\nportend far-reaching changes in our understanding of individual\nidentity and what it is to be human. Whether law in the form of\nprohibitions or regulations should be imposed on these practices, or\nwhether they are a matter for individuals to decide for themselves, is\ndeeply contested. Some liberal feminists, for example, argue that\nindividual\u2019s choices about the reproductive risks they are\nwilling to take should be respected, especially when they are striving\nto avoid disease in their potential offspring.\n\nAn ongoing theme in all these debates about marriage, reproduction,\nand the body has been the extent to which these issues should be\nunderstood in terms of protecting liberty, and how much they should be\nunderstood in terms of achieving equality. For liberal feminists, the\nextent to which women may exercise uncoerced choice over their bodies\nand their private lives is key. If women choose marriages in which\nthey are dependent economically, make choices about how many children\nthey will have, and elect to spend their lives in uncompensated\ndomestic labor, those decisions should be respected as long as they\nare not coerced. For other feminists, what is critical is the extent\nto which even apparently free choices are exercised against a backdrop\nof economic inequality or patriarchal dominance. For these feminists,\neconomic dependency and norms of dominance call into question the\npossibility of genuinely free choice.\n4. Violence Against Women\n\nNo individual is entitled to inflict gratuitous harm upon another and\nno one should have to live in fear. These are among the few\nuncontroversial principles accepted in all moral systems and form the\ncore of the criminal law in every society. Keeping peace and order has\nlong been considered a fundamental justification for the very\nexistence of the state or legal authority. Many philosophers have\nexplicitly supported this idea, even those who argue for limitations\non the state.\n J.S. Mill,\n for example, argued that the only legitimate reason for interference\nby the state in the affairs of individuals is to prevent one person\nfrom harming another. Thomas Hobbes argued that peace (i.e., personal\nsecurity) is the ultimate political value for which a rational\nindividual would sign on to the social contract justifying state power\nto protect the security of every man from the potential threat of\nevery other (see the entry on\n Hobbes\u2019 moral and political philosophy).\n And\n Montesquieu\n defined political liberty as the tranquility of mind that comes from\nnot being subject to fear for one\u2019s safety. To achieve such\ntranquility of mind he proposed the separation of (governmental)\npowers to retard the abuse of power that could so threaten the\nsecurity of citizens. From\n Confucius\n and Lao Tzu to Mohammed or Gandhi, and from the Ten Commandments to\nthe Code of Hammurabi, personal security\u2014freedom from\nfear\u2014is a value that the state is expected to secure and\nmaintain.\n\nUntil the 20th century, however, these commitments did not\nprotect women from a frequent source of danger, their intimates: \nhusbands, lovers, relatives, friends, or employers. Indeed, for much\nof history these common threats to the personal security of women were\nnot recognized as harms at all that it was the business of the state\nto address. Instead, they were frequently taken to be inevitable, a\nmatter of right, or justifiable. Not surprisingly, a great deal of\nfeminist legal scholarly attention and reform effort has been directed\nto revealing and changing the many ways in which law fails to protect\nwomen and girls against forms of violence such as rape (including date\nrape and marital rape), domestic abuse, sexual harassment, and other\ntypes of abuse. Although some countries do not collect official data\nand the nature and incidence of such violence varies widely by\nculture, many studies indicate that no society is exempt from these\nforms of violence. The 2012\n United Nations Millennium Development Goals Report\n observed that although equal numbers of boys and girls are now\nattending school across the globe, violence against women continues to\nundermine progress towards all goals. \n\nIn legal theory about gendered violence, the possibility of separating\nthe public from the private sphere is critical. Historically law did\nnot address injuries inflicted by intimates. So, while the single\ngreatest civil purpose of law has been to keep men from violating one\nanother (the only greater being to repel foreign invasion), much\nviolation of women by men has been considered as a private matter\nbeyond the purview of law. Domestic chastisement was once considered\nlegitimate discipline of one\u2019s wife and marital rape was\nexcluded from the definition of rape in many criminal law statutes.\nFeminists criticized the presumption that such behavior among\nintimates was beyond the purview of the criminal law and these\nlimitations have largely been overcome, at least in the United States\nand Europe.\n\nMany other problematic aspects of rape law have also been revised in\nlight of feminist critiques. Historically, rape by an acquaintance was\nnot seen as \u201creal rape\u201d (Estrich 1987) but as more likely\nconsensual sex. Acquaintance rape was made virtually impossible to\nprove by strict corroboration requirements and other rules of\nevidence. Another hurdle to proof of rape presented by the rules of\nevidence was the requirement of active resistance: victims who did not\nactively resist\u2014including those who were most terrorized or who\nfeared harm from resistance\u2014were judged to have consented to\nwhatever happened to them, or at least to have reasonably appeared to\ntheir attackers as consenting (McGregor 2007). Victims also were\ndiscouraged from pursuing complaints by evidence rules that permitted\nthem to be examined about past sexual histories, thus forcing them to\nreveal intimate private matters and subjecting them to judgment as\nimmoral themselves. Victims who delayed reporting alleged rapes,\nperhaps out of shame or fear, were considered not to have made a fresh\ncomplaint and thus to be less credible. Many of these rules have been\nformally overturned but it is less clear whether as a practical matter\nthey continue to infect decisions such as whether to prosecute, how to\nexamine witnesses, or how to assess the credibility of witnesses.\n\nContemporary discussions of the definition and proof of rape continue\nto struggle with questions such as what consent to sex really means.\nSome feminists have argued that there is a domain of wrongful sex that\nis different from rape; Cahill (2016), for example, argues that sex\nthat occurs within context of structural injustice is unjust sex that\nmay be within a gray area of ambiguity. She distinguishes cases in\nwhich the woman is less than fully willing, cases in which the\nwoman\u2019s will is clearly overcome, and cases in which the victim\ncannot fully consent due to incapacity. What distinguishes these types\nof cases, Cahill says, is how the victim\u2019s sexual agency is\ndeployed. She characterizes as unjust sex in the gray area in which\nthe woman\u2019s sexual agency is actively sought but undermined for\nexample in circumstances in which her consent is simply expected or in\nwhich it is difficult for her to express unwillingness. Subtle\ndiscussions such as this illuminate why some rape cases are so\ndifficult for law to handle, as law deals in bright line\ndeterminations such as whether conduct was criminal. Allegations of\nrape in contexts in which one of the parties is under the influence of\ndrugs or alcohol also place pressure on the idea of agency in the\ncontext of sex. Heyes (2016) explores the phenomenology of agency and\nthe harms of assaults involving victims who are semiconscious or\nunconscious.\n\nDifficulties about consent and proof attend other forms of violence\nagainst women as wll. Incest, like rape, was always illegal but rarely\nadmitted, let alone prosecuted. Prosecutors were all too willing to\ndrop charges when women chose not to press them, potentially confusing\nrespect for the victim\u2019s choices with her fear of embarrassment\nor coercion. And sexual harassment (like sex discrimination) simply\ndid not exist as legal claims until the 1960s or later (MacKinnon\n& Siegel 2004; MacKinnon 1979). So it is clear not only that equal\nprotection of law for women was not recognized until recently, but\nalso that the force of law was used to back male dominance. If a man\nwere attacked on the street he could pursue his attacker in the courts\nof law. If a woman were attacked in her home she had no legal cause of\naction as it was considered a private matter. Many feminist critics\ncontend that in important respects such domestic violence amnesia\ncontinues to characterize how law functions (Dempsey 2009). This is\ntrue in both criminal law and the law of private damages, according to\nthese critics (Chamallas & Wriggins 2010).\n\nOver the past 30 years or so, many jurisdictions across the globe have\nenacted major improvements in formal legal protections against\nviolence once considered private. Rape laws have been reformed to\nvarying degrees in many societies, although even the best arguably\nstill have far to go (McGregor 2005; Estrich 2001; Taslitz 1999;\nSchulhofer 1998). For example, most western nations no longer require\ncorroboration of rape by witnesses. In many jurisdictions, consent is\nno longer presumed from the absence of resistance and far stricter\nrequirements for the relevance of evidence are in place. Feminist\nlawyers have worked hard to secure these legal reforms and they\nrepresent important achievements. International law too has recognized\nthe rape of women in war as a crime against humanity (see the United\nNations International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia page on\n Crimes of Sexual Violence),\n and prosecutions for this crime have recently taken place for the\nfirst time in history. Sexual harassment and sex discrimination are\nnow rather widely recognized as wrongful behavior and legal causes of\naction in a variety of forms.\n\nDespite this significant progress in formal law, crime statistics\ncontinue to verify that violence against women remains a problem of\nmajor proportions. Reporting rates are low. Conviction rates in no\nsense reflect a full commitment to punishing these crimes on a par\nwith punishment of other crimes (Estrich 2001; Schulhofer 1998). The\nresult of such enforcement failure, feminists contend, is that in\npractice men have almost the same powers over women that were\nhistorically enshrined in law. A woman may no longer be legally\nrequired to remain with a husband who beats her, but if she has\nnowhere to go, no income or employment opportunities but children to\nsupport, then her restriction is in practice the same as it was in the\npast (see Gendercide Watch;\n WomenWatch).\n Given long-standing customs of subordination, the traditional\ndisparity of power, and the typical difference in size and strength\nbetween men and women, the threat of physical harm and the\ndifferential exercise of economic and political power are sufficient\nto maintain male dominance unless the law intercedes to counteract\nthese forces (Husseini 2007; Manderson 2003; Schneider 2000; Rhode\n1997). Both in the US and elsewhere, immigrant or undocumented women\nmay be particularly vulnerable both to their partners and to\nenforcement failures.\n\nSo, why hasn\u2019t the law interceded more successfully? Feminist\ntheorists give different answers to this question. Liberal feminists\nmay focus on biased attitudes of police officers, prosecutors, and\njudges, the majority of whom are male. Other feminists point to\npersistent economic inequality between women and men, with resulting\ndependency that makes it difficult for women to leave abusive\nrelationships or to resist harassment. For example, Schultz (2003)\nargues that opposition to sexual harassment should not be identified\nwith opposition to sex in the workplace but instead with opposition to\npractices that tend to exclude women from jobs and with a vision of\ngenuine equality at work.\n\nDominance feminists offer the more radical critique that the\npervasiveness, seriousness, and tenacity of male threats and the\ninadequacy of official responses reflect the patriarchal construction\nof gender itself on a model of dominance and submission. That is, the\nlaw reflects a way of thinking on which masculinity means strength,\nforcefulness, aggressiveness, and domination and femininity means\ndelicacy, resistance, submission, and subordination. The distinction\nbetween persuasion and force appears as a fine line that is easy to\ncross. If the distinction between normal sexual behavior and rape\nturns on a last minute decision by a woman to stop resisting and\nsubmit, then it will hardly be surprising if rape turns out to be both\nvery pervasive and widely denied (McGregor 2005; MacKinnon 1989).\nFurthermore, if the very concept of masculinity is not just strength\nbut domination, then resorting to violence to enforce female\nsubordination is a clear correlate of the model. If standards of\nreasonableness\u2014what it is reasonable to expect partners to\nunderstand, to ask, and to do\u2014are male, the boundaries of\nacceptable behavior will look very different than if judgments of\nreasonableness are understood to be gendered\u2014and, largely, male.\nFinally, if the natural relation between the sexes is taken to be both\nhierarchical and adversarial, then a male dominated legal system\nformulated by men from a male perspective is bound to protect the\ninterests of men at the expense of women whenever the two conflict or\nare perceived to conflict. Thus, the patriarchal construction of\ngender makes domination the model of masculinity and rape (or at least\npower and submission) the model of sex (MacKinnon & Siegel 2004;\nEstrich 2001, 1987; Schneider 2000; Schulhofer 1998; MacKinnon\n1989).\n\nThis dominance critique has been widely misunderstood, however.\nCritics of the dominance approach characterize it as condemning all\nsex and indicting all men as rapists, but this criticism is to some\nextent unfair. A few exaggerated claims made by some feminists, highly\npublicized in the early 1970s, did condemn all sex. But in a more\nenduring sense the dominance critique relies on several observations\nthat illustrate the truth of feminist claims about the entrenchment of\npatriarchy as the status quo and the domination model of sexuality.\nMany feminists claim that the use of sex to dominate is pervasive,\naffecting how people think and interact in all cultures (Schneider\n2000; MacKinnon 1989). Critics interpret this observation as a claim\nthat every sexual act is an act of domination (or rape), an inference\nthat does not follow from the general observation about the role of\nsex in oppression. Part of the reason for reinterpretation is that\nonce again feminists are arguing against the norm. If feminists are\ncorrect that domination is the patriarchal model of sexuality and\npatriarchy is the status quo, then it is not surprising if they appear\nto be arguing against all sex itself, at least according to anyone who\ncannot envision an alternative model of sex.\n\nInitially, feminists were divided in how to address the dominance\nmodel of sexuality in law and society. Focusing on causes or\ninfluences, some feminists attempted to challenge media stereotypes,\nan approach for which they were criticized as censors. Some challenged\nthe fashion and beauty industry with minuscule impact while suffering\nconsiderable personal ridicule for their efforts. Some focused on\nopposing pornography (especially violent pornography) as the symbol of\nthe dominance model and developed model anti-pornography statutes for\njurisdictions to enact (see the entry on\n pornography and censorship).\n When one jurisdiction\u2014Indianapolis\u2014did enact a statute\nproviding injunctive relief and a damages remedy for violent\npornography, it was quickly held to be an unconstitutional violation\nof free speech\n (American Booksellers v. Hudnut,\n (771 F.2d 323 (7th Cir. 1985)).  That the feminist message of\nopposing female subordination was criticized as a Victorian\ncondemnation of immoral sex, some feminists contended, illustrated the\ndeep entrenchment of the domination model. Instead, feminists\nsuggested developing better models of masculinity (MacKinnon &\nSiegel 2004; Estrich 2001; Rhode 1997). More recently, many feminists\nhave explored the role of structural injustice in maintaining gender\noppression (e.g. Parekh 2011))\n\nConflicts continue to this day over the permissible limits on free\nspeech, both where sex is involved and more generally. The development\nof video and robotic technologies that allow highly realistic\nsimulations of degrading or violent sexual acts have placed additional\nchallenges to regulatory efforts, as these depictions do not require\nhuman performance and thus do not directly harm individuals creating\nthe depictions. Some argue that viewing these materials should be\ncriminalized because this conduct is wrongful and it can be the proper\nobject of the criminal law to punish wrongdoing even when it does not\nharm others directly (Danaher 2017). Feminists have pointed out that\ndrawing the line for state intervention at direct harm to others hews\nclosely to problematic distinctions between the public and the private\ndrawn by Millian liberals. Bracewell (2016) observes in addition that\nthe earlier ordinances advocated by MacKinnon and others proposed\ndamage remedies and injunctive relief rather than criminalization; the\ncarceral turn against violent speech is more readily aligned with\nliberalism\u2019s delineation of the proper role of the state as\nharm-prevention. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down\nCalifornia\u2019s statute imposing civil fines for the sale of\nviolent video games to minors rested on the liberal view that\ncontent-based regulation of speech is impermissible,\n Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association,\n 564 U.S. 786 (2011).\n\nFinally, feminist legal scholars have proposed legislation and trial\npractice procedures that would treat domestic violence as part of a\nsystematic cultural environment that discriminates against women\n(Schneider 2000). These proposals are regularly undermined by (well\nmeaning) therapeutic models that treat domestic violence as individual\npsychological problems of anger management or substance abuse or the\nlike, rather than as part of a widespread social problem. Medical\napproaches often depersonalize the issue as family dysfunction. The\nmale perpetrator seems to disappear and responsibility fades as though\nthe harm were caused by a disease rather than by a violent man, a\nresponsible human agent. Clearly countering entrenched acceptance of\nmale violence against women will take long-term, concerted effort.\nImpressive gains have been made, but much more is needed (MacKinnon\n2006; Husseini 2007; Manderson 2003; Schneider 2000; Hassan 1998).\n5. Equality in Social and Economic Life\n\nUnequal treatment in social and economic life\u2014in schools, public\naccommodations, employment, housing, insurance, pensions, investment,\nsports, the environment, and more\u2014has been another target of\nfeminist legal critique. Here, too, the question has been what equal\ntreatment under law requires in the face of differences, including\nsupposed biological differences, histories of discrimination, and\nentrenched social institutions. The law has developed from the removal\nof outright barriers\u2014male-only public universities, for\nexample\u2014to non-discrimination, to consideration of what\nconditions and practices adversely affect women to the extent of\ngenerating inequalities that ought to be addressed in law.\n\nIn the US from the 1940s on, courts gradually began to enforce the\nEqual Protection clause of the 14th Amendment to apply\nstrict scrutiny to state-imposed categorizations based on race; later\non, constitutional law began to address whether race and sex could be\nanalogized or even coupled for purposes of analysis (Mayeri 2011). In\n1963, the US Congress passed the Equal Pay Act, amending the Fair\nLabor Standards Act to prohibit unequal pay on the basis of sex for\n\u201cequal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal\nskill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under\nsimilar working conditions,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7206(d) (2012).\n(Congress, in a dispute about comparable worth, left open the\ninterpretive question of whether this statute requires the same pay\nfor the same work or equal pay for substantially equivalent jobs, a\ncomparable worth standard.) The Civil Rights Act of 1964 followed the\nnext year, explicitly establishing rights not to be discriminated\nagainst on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin in\nareas that included employment (Title VII), education (Title IX) and\ngovernmental benefits. Many nations have similar laws (phrased in\nvarying language) and these have been or could be of considerable\nbenefit to women, especially where bias is overt and provable.\n\nUnfortunately, in much of the world today discrimination is far from\novert, but no less effective for its increased subtlety. In some ways\nprogress toward equality has been substantial in many parts of the\nworld. But in other respects advances have been slow, even in\nprogressive nations. Enshrining equality in law is a far different\nmatter from implementing it in practice. Women have been active\nparticipants in the public sphere in large numbers in many societies\nfor thirty years or more. Yet the great majority of women remain\nclustered in the bottom or middle ranks in otherwise male dominated\nprofessions, or segregated into traditionally female fields. Politics\nremain strongly male dominated. And the top echelons of business are\nstill a male preserve: the so-called glass ceiling (Kellerman &\nRhode 2007; Fineman & Dougherty 2005; Estrich 2001). Despite\nincreased educational, political and employment opportunities for\nwomen, the feminization of poverty (Pearce 1978) continues to increase\nwhile equality of power remains elusive. Changes in divorce law and\nthe law of alimony and child support have been factors in\npoverty\u2019s feminization (Smock, Manning & Gupta 1999),\nraising questions for feminist theory about whether equality requires\nre-institution of protectionist laws. In employment, women\nconsistently earn less for comparable work in the same field, and\nfemale dominated occupations are consistently paid less than male\ndominated ones, even when the male occupations require less education\nand involve less responsibility (Kellerman & Rhode 2007; Allen\n2005; Fineman & Dougherty 2005; Roberts 2002; Estrich 2001;\nWilliams 2001; Rhode 1997). For feminist legal scholars, the\noverarching question is what roles the law should play in\nresponse.\n\nOne set of issues concerns the effects of bias that cannot be\ndemonstrated to be intentional discrimination: bias that is\nunrecognized or implicit but that is bias nonetheless. In employment\nand other areas of social and economic life, supposedly objective\nrules may be applied differently to men and women. For example, a\nwoman may be told the company does not allow part time work, but a man\nmay be allowed to cut back in order to pursue some valued activity,\nsuch as holding political office. And women are often graded or\nevaluated lower on the basis of gender alone, without the recognition\nthat this is what is taking place. Symphony orchestras famously\ndiscovered that the number of women musicians selected rose\ndramatically when applicants auditioned anonymously from behind a\nscreen (Goldin & Rouse 2000). One use of statistical evidence in\nantidiscrimination law in the US is to raise inferences of\nunrecognized bias, hence discrimination, in situations such as\nthis.\n\nA further set of issues concerns how law should address the disparate\nimpact of apparently sex-neutral policies. Even without explicit or\nimplicit bias, many longstanding policies may affect men and women\ndifferently. Policies discouraging or prohibiting part time work, when\nconsistently applied to both men and women, may still have quite\ndifferent consequences for parents with primary responsibility for\nchild care, thus disadvantaging women disproportionately. As Williams\n(2010) points out, the US continues to have a workplace structured on\nthe basis of the norms of the 1950s, assuming a breadwinner husband\nand a wife at home taking care of the children. Flexible work\nschedules, predictable shifts, consistent start and stop times, day\ntime work, or part time work at hourly rates or with benefits\nproportionately equivalent to those of full time workers simply are\nnot available to much of the workforce in the US or elsewhere.\nMoreover, the US, unlike other advanced industrial societies, has no\ngeneral statutory requirement for paid family leave.\n\nThese many policies pose classic dilemmas of difference and can be\ndeconstructed by understanding the male norms they assume, as\ndiscussed in Section 1. Employment policies concerning pregnancy are\nnotorious examples warranting separate mention. At one point, the U.S.\nSupreme Court concluded that failure to cover pregnancy under state or\nemployer disability insurance programs was not discrimination on the\nbasis of sex, as it differentiated between pregnant persons and\nnon-pregnant persons.\n (Geduldig v. Aiello,\n 417 U.S. 484 (1974);\n General Electric Co. v. Gilbert,\n 429 U.S. 125 (1976)). Since pregnancy did not affect all women,\ndenying pregnancy benefits did not discriminate against women on the\nbasis of sex, or so the reasoning went, although these policies would\ncertainly have different impacts on women than on men. Men and women\nwere being treated the same: neither received pregnancy benefits. So\nmen did not receive any benefits that women did not receive. And women\ndid not receive any benefits that men did not receive. The logical\nimplication was that requiring a benefits program to include pregnancy\nbenefits for women would entitle them not to equal rights, but to\nspecial rights; not to equal treatment but to special treatment (Olsen\n1995; Smith 1993; Bartlett & Kennedy 1991). Feminists were stunned\nby this argument\u2014after all, only women can become\npregnant\u2014and the US Congress enacted the Pregnancy\nDiscrimination Act several years later.  The most recent\nbattleground over apparently neutral rules has been the recognition of\nexceptions for employers with religious objections from providing\ncontraceptive coverage for their employees.\n\nIn addition, some policies that differentiate based on sex may be\nperceived as just or as beneficial to women. Affirmative action\npolicies designed to root out the lingering effects of prior\ndiscrimination are an example of policies differentiating on the basis\nof sex that may be regarded as just. Other policies have been seen\njustified on a variety of grounds, including benefits to society,\nbenefits to women, or distributive justice. In the US, these have\nincluded excluding women from jury duty based on their supposed\nresponsibilities in the home, giving survivor\u2019s benefits to\nwidows but not to widowers, and creating single-sex schools. To some\ncritics, all of these policies violate formal equality. To feminists,\nunderlying issues for achieving equality include determining whether\nany of these policies enforce stereotypes, entrench prejudice, or\ntreat anyone unfairly\u2014and whether law should be used to\nchallenge them as a result.\n\nMoreover, sex is not the only ground of legally actionable\ndiscrimination. Some critical race theorists, queer theorists,\ndisability theorists, and other feminist legal philosophers have both\nclarified and complicated the issue of equality and difference by\npointing to discrimination based on race, class, ethnicity, sexual\norientation, disability and age (Mayeri 2011; Nussbaum 2006; Allen\n2005; Crenshaw 1996, 1989; Valdes 1995; Matsuda 1987). As discussed\nabove, the scholarship on intersectionality creates complex pictures\nof identity and the structure of discrimination. For example,\nemployment discrimination against women of color may not be simply a\nmatter of race-plus or sex-plus, but a phenomenon of interaction\nbetween these and possibly other categories. Some feminists have\npointed out as a problem in particular of liberal feminism that much\nof its focus is directed to the concerns of white, middle class,\nprofessional women (Williams 2011, 1997, 1992; Roberts 2002; Crenshaw\net al. 1996). \n\nFor all these reasons, women remain at a serious disadvantage both at\nwork and at home (Williams 2010; Fineman & Dougherty 2005; Roberts\n2002; Okin 1995). In the workplace it has been noted that despite the\nmany forms of discrimination described above, many women are able to\nprogress quite well as long as they function as perfect workers (i.e.\nas men). These women also have the greatest legal resources to combat\ndiscrimination, which shows that the workplace has changed little and\nthat the standard of evaluation is still male (Williams 2010; Fineman\n2004; Estrich 2001). This precludes women from being mothers and still\nbeing treated as equals in the workplace. Many instances of\ndiscrimination appear to start when a woman becomes a mother, even if\nher work product has not changed. And many women find themselves in\nthe double bind of being disliked and disapproved of as bad mothers or\ndiscounted and disrespected as uncommitted workers. This has been\nidentified as discrimination and is often legally actionable. Joan\nWilliams (2001) has called this additional barrier the \u201cmaternal\nwall\u201d and adds it to the glass ceiling as a form of illegal\ndiscrimination. But it remains difficult to prove and difficult to\ncounteract. Feminist philosophers of law have offered a variety of\nproposals for counteracting it (Allen 2005; Fineman 2004; Estrich\n2001; Williams 2001; Rhode 1997). Some societies handle the\ncoordination of family and work better than others, and some progress\nhas been made in some places; but the burdens of domestic labor in the\nprivate sphere remain greatly undervalued and largely invisible, and\nthe stereotype of the domestic and nurturing mother is deeply\nentrenched.\n\nThe economic disadvantages of women at work are reinforced by domestic\ndisadvantages, either as a formal matter of family law or in the\nimplicit biases in how apparently neutral rules are applied. While\nmost societies idealize the role of the mother, her domestic work is\nconsistently undervalued or unpaid. As a result, often when mothers\nseek divorce, child custody, and property settlements they are gravely\ndisadvantaged (Fineman 2004; Williams 2001; Weitzman 1992, 1987). In\nsome societies the de-valued status of wives and daughters leaves them\nwithout inheritance, property, or even without adequate food, health\ncare, or education (Carr et al. 1996; Okin 1995; Sen 1995; Chen\n1995,1983). Many feminist legal scholars have offered proposals for\nrevising some family laws with some modest success. Some have\nsuggested pay scales for traditional domestic duties and alternative\nmodels for custody suits and property settlements (Williams 2001; Jain\n1995; Olsen 1983). And some feminists have analyzed the domestic ideal\nitself, suggesting an alternative legal model of the family. Martha\nFineman (2004, 1995) has argued that the state has no reason to\nreinforce and privilege the sexual family\u2014the sexual relation\nbetween a man and a woman that is the traditional basis of marriage as\na legal institution. Rather, the care-giving relation is what should\nbe encouraged and supported by the state. One problem with the\ncare-giving role is that it makes the care-giver dependent on another\nsource of income, typically and traditionally a breadwinner. It is\nthis dependent status of the care-giver that needs to be addressed in\nlaw and public policy, assuming that care-giving is a positive and\nindeed a crucial role in human life. According to this view, the myth\nof autonomy is an unfortunate side effect of a male perspective that\ntends to make the private domestic sphere both invisible and de-valued\n(Fineman 2004, 1995). And this issue is further complicated by the\nintersection of gender with race and class (Roberts 2002).\n\nThis de-valuation and invisibility has contributed directly to the\nfeminization of poverty, which is now a problem of global proportions.\nGlobal poverty is getting worse, and increasingly women bear the brunt\nof it. Two billion people (about one out of three) live in extreme\npoverty on less than two dollars a day. About 800 million go to bed\nhungry every night, and eight million die from poverty related causes\neach year. More than seventy per cent of them (nearly three fourths)\nare female. So serious are the effects of extreme poverty on women\n(and girls) that the World Health Organization has named it a disease\n(\u201cextreme poverty,\u201d coded Z59.5) and called it \u201cthe\nworld\u2019s most ruthless killer\u201d (Jain 2005, p. 138).\n\nThe reasons for the feminization of poverty are complex and differ in\nimportant respects by culture. Some women are poor because their\nsociety is poor\u2014devastated by natural disasters or war and\nsocial turmoil, or sapped by corrupt officials or colonial powers.\nSome are refugees, and some are sick, old, or disabled. Many of the\npoor are children. It has been noted that extreme poverty for both men\nand women is attributable to a variety of entrenched traditional\nstructures such as class or caste hierarchies, ethnic or religious\ndiscrimination and unequal land distribution (Carr, Chen &\nJhabvala 1996). And often these long term structural problems are\naggravated by globalization, world markets, economic restructuring and\nsuch recent trends in the world economy. Women\u2019s poverty results\nfrom all these factors: being part of a poor family, village, or\nregion, but is compounded by the subordination of women within the\nfamily, community or social structure at large. When poverty is bad it\nis worse for women. When food and medicine are short the most deprived\nare women and girls. Norms of seclusion\u2014exclusion from\ninheritance, lack of credit, lack of training and education\u2014all\ndisadvantage women and girls. In all societies the poorest women carry\ncompounded burdens of discrimination by race, class, caste or religion\nas well as sex discrimination (Roberts 1995; Chen 1995; Crenshaw 1989;\nMatsuda 1987).\n\nMany programs have been proposed and initiated to alleviate this\nproblem. Women\u2019s unions and cooperative associations have been\nformed. New models of credit and lending are being tested. The UN,\nvarious NGOs and Women\u2019s Organizations, as well as national and\nlocal organizations, have been working to increase opportunities for\nliteracy and employment for women and girls (Jain, 2005; Carr, Chen\n& Jhabvala 1996; Nussbaum & Glover 1995). Pioneers of\nmicro-lending Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank received the Nobel\nPeace Prize in 2006. Yet poverty and polarization are increasing in\nmany societies. Many feminists are now of the view that reform of\neconomic and social institutions is critical to the well being of\nwomen. The sharp distinction between public and private labor needs to\nbe recognized as an artificial one (Fineman and Dougherty 2005). As\nnoted by Chen, \u201cso long as policy-makers make the artificial\ndistinction between the farm and the household, between paid work and\nunpaid work, between productive and domestic work, women will continue\nto be overlooked\u201d (1983, p. 220). Thus, the interaction between\nprivate labor and the public good must be, and is beginning to be,\nacknowledged. For example, Chen (2011) argues, contributions of unpaid\nlabor should be included in estimates of GDPs; contributions of work\nin the informal sector (which tends to be dominated by women and low\nincome men) is increasingly being included in national and\ninstitutional studies potentially affecting economic policy; and\nunpaid domestic labor is now sometimes considered as having monetary\nvalue in court cases.\n\nSome feminists have concluded that, like the dominance model of\nsexuality, the domestic model of women\u2019s unpaid labor may not be\naddressed by denouncing it directly. It may also require incremental\nerosion by addressing its causes and effects. That is, it must\ngradually be replaced with a better model. According to Chen (1995,\n1983), for example, (ideological) arguments for the equality of women\nin rural India and Bangladesh were met with great resistance, but when\nthe approach was revised to provide pragmatic assistance for economic\ndevelopment to poor women that substantially improved their lives (and\nthus the lives of their families) resistance substantially decreased.\nDreze and Sen (1989, p. 58) have noted \u201cconsiderable evidence\nthat greater involvement in outside work does tend to go with less\nanti-female bias in intra-family distribution.\u201d Respect for\nwomen arguably increases as their independence increases.\n\nCommunist societies that purported to institute equality for women\nfrom the top down, so to speak, failed to accomplish their goal\nprecisely by overlooking the obvious conflict between the perfect\nmother and the perfect worker. For example, commentators such as Li\n(1995) contend that in China the Communist model of equality\nsuperimposed a thin veneer of equal gender relations over 5,000 year\nold patriarchal customs that strongly socialized women to the roles of\nobedient and deferential wife and daughter. Combining these norms with\nCommunist women\u2019s equal obligations as workers created double\nobligations for women without any real recognition of the double role\nas a double burden (Li 1995). Some feminists have noted that the\nSoviet Communist idea of gender equality and its post-communist\ndevelopment created a triple burden, as women were expected to\nfunction in three roles: wife and mother; good worker or professional;\nand social activist (Petrova 1993). And today, as women enter the\npublic sphere around the globe, they carry the burdens of the private\nsphere with them, because the institutional structure has not been\nchanged to accommodate social and economic evolution or to recognize\nthe value of traditional women\u2019s work (Fineman 2004, 1995).\n\nMany feminists have concluded at this point that it is critical to\nmainstream women into the public sphere, thereby increasing their\nvisibility as economic contributors and, thus, their control over\ntheir own lives. It is crucial to weaken the public/private\ndistinction to make the general work environment more hospitable to\nparents and caregivers in general. And it is imperative to continue to\nraise feminist consciousness: to identify the bias of male norms, and\nyet to attend to the contextual surroundings necessary for an accurate\nassessment of complex human relations, as well as pragmatic solutions\nto longstanding entrenched inequality. Law is a critical tool in this\neffort (Stark 2004; Williams 2000; Okin 1995).\n6. Conclusion\n\nLaw furthers social stability but may entrench norms of oppression.\nLaw can also be a necessary means for reform.  Law can be an\nanchor to the past or an engine for the future. Each function has its\nplace. Feminist legal philosophy is an effort to examine and\nreformulate legal doctrine to overcome entrenched bias and enforced\ninequality of the past as it structures human concepts and\ninstitutions for the future.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abrams, K. and H.
