    "main_text": "Problem of Evil\n7. Bayle Enigma\n\nThere are few authors in the early modern period whose works are more\ndifficult than those of Bayle to interpret on even the most basic\nlevel. What is the ultimate conclusion of any particular work by\nBayle? What are the main arguments? When is Bayle writing in his own\nvoice and when is he writing in the voice of an imagined character?\nWhat are the appropriate contexts in which to read Bayle\u2019s\nworks? Who were the intended audiences? These can be straightforward\nquestions to answer when reading philosophical authors; most authors\nanswer the questions themselves in a Preface. However, Bayle usually\nwrote books anonymously for fictional audiences with explicit aims\nthat were often mere pretences for the real purpose behind his books.\nIf there is any single, overarching thesis of any of his works, it is\nburied very deeply indeed. Taking Bayle\u2019s oeuvre as a\nwhole, the interpretive difficulties are even more challenging. Thomas\nLennon gives the most memorable statement of this problem that is\nknown as the \u201cBayle Enigma\u201d:\n\n\nTo take just the twentieth-century literature, the suggestions are\nthat Bayle was fundamentally a positivist, an atheist, a deist, a\nskeptic, a fideist, a Socinian, a liberal Calvinist, a conservative\nCalvinist, a libertine, a Judaizing Christian, a Judaeo-Christian, or\neven a secret Jew, a Manichean, an existentialist\u2026to the point\nthat it is tempting to conclude that these commentators cannot have\nbeen talking about the same author, or at least that they have not\nused the same texts. There can be overlap among these classifications,\nso that not all of the interpretations entirely exclude one another.\nImplausible as it may seem, moreover, all of these suggestions have at\nleast some plausibility. (Lennon 1999: 15)\n\n\n\u201cThe Bayle Enigma\u201d is the term used to denote the\ndifficulty one faces when trying to label or to categorize or to\ninterpret Bayle\u2019s works as a whole or individually. The\ndifficulty arises from the fact that numerous labels seem to fit\nBayle\u2019s writings, but some of these labels are mutually\nexclusive. It is tempting to dismiss the Enigma on the basis that all\ngreat authors are complex and write works with multiple layers of\nmeaning: why do we need to label authors anyway? But in the case of\nBayle, the problem is that his works are not just complex, but\nseemingly self-contradictory. In one and the same book, and even in\none and the same argument, Bayle might be advocating faith in God or\nhe might be undermining belief in the existence of God\u2014it\ndepends how you read him. Some engagement with the Bayle Enigma is\ntherefore necessary just to enter into Bayle\u2019s works on the most\nelementary level.\n\nFour global interpretations of Bayle\u2019s works have recurred since\nhis death over three centuries ago: the atheist reading, the skeptical\nreading, the Christian-fideist reading, and the Rationalist reading.\nThese are by no means the only possible interpretations of\nBayle\u2019s writings; they are just the most common readings because\nthey are the most plausible. Bayle\u2019s enemy Jurieu was the first\nto launch the accusation of atheism against Bayle in his own lifetime,\nmaking his case largely on the basis of the Various Thoughts on a\nComet with its elaborate defences of the virtuous atheist and the\nSociety of Atheists. The most recent and influential interpreter to\nfind a commitment to atheism in Bayle\u2019s works is Gianluca Mori,\nwhose 1999 Bayle philosophe argues that \u201c[a]ll the\nroads of the philosophical reflection of Bayle lead to atheism\u201d\n(Mori 1999 [2020: 189]). The main evidence of Bayle\u2019s atheism,\naccording to Mori, is his obsession with the problem of evil\nthroughout his life, and in particular his contention that there is no\nsystem of Christian thought that can resolve this problem. The\neveryday experience of every human being, no matter how privileged\nthey are, provides ample evidence that the universe is not the work of\nan infinitely good creator. Any theodicy that attempts to reconcile\nthe experiences of pain and sin with the existence of an infinitely\ngood creator will have to limit that creator in some way, either in\nits power, its knowledge, or its uniqueness, to the point that the\ncreator will cease to resemble anything worthy of the name\n\u201cGod\u201d. According to Mori, the simplest way to read\nBayle\u2019s hundreds of thousands of published words devoted to the\nproblem of evil is to read them as an argument that God does not\nexist.\n\nMori\u2019s interpretation of Bayle is compelling, especially today\nwhen the problem of evil is routinely viewed not only as an argument,\nbut as the most powerful argument, against the existence of the\nAbrahamic God. However, there are at least two problems with\nMori\u2019s interpretation taken broadly. The first is that Bayle was\nconsistent and adamant throughout his career that the conclusion of\nhis reflection on the problem of evil is not that God does not exist,\nbut that reason is too weak to reconcile the existence of a perfect\nGod with the human experience of evil. This conclusion is, on the\nsurface at least, skeptical rather than atheistic. For Bayle, the\nproblem of evil is just another example of human reason\u2019s\nincapacity to resolve problems involving the concepts of infinity and\nunity. Intractable difficulties relating to infinite divisibility,\nlike Zeno\u2019s paradoxes, and persistent problems in explaining the\nunion of mind and body in a single human person are non-theological\nexamples in Bayle\u2019s thought of the failure of reason in matters\nrelating to infinity and unity. The problem of evil, on the skeptical\nreading of Bayle, is just Bayle\u2019s favorite theological argument\nfor the limits of reason.\n\nAccording to the Christian-fideist reading, the problem of evil is\nBayle\u2019s main tool for displaying to readers the need for faith\nin addition to reason. Calvin and Jurieu were two thinkers whose\ncommitments to Christianity were never questioned and who, prior to\nBayle, argued in print that human reason could not resolve all the\ndifficulties relating to evil. Seen in this context, Bayle\u2019s\nwritings on evil are not original attacks on theism, as Mori reads\nthem, but rather traditional Calvinist attacks on reason with the aim\nof pointing the way to faith. Elisabeth Labrousse (1964) and Walter\nRex (1965) demonstrate the ways in which all of Bayle\u2019s writings\ncan be illuminated by reading them in the context of Christian\npolemics, mainly between Calvinists and Catholics. According to\nLabrousse and Rex, Bayle was an opponent not of Christianity in\ngeneral, but only of one branch of Christianity\u2014Roman\nCatholicism.\n\nAnother clarifying context for understanding much of Bayle\u2019s\nphilosophical reflection is Rationalism. Todd Ryan (2009) and Antony\nMcKenna (2015) have shown that Bayle was not skeptical of all\nphilosophical dogmas. He remained committed, in Ryan\u2019s view, to\na variety of specific Cartesian metaphysical doctrines, like mind-body\ndualism, the ontology of substance, and matter as extension,\nthroughout his career. In McKenna\u2019s view, Bayle remained\ncommitted to the rational certainty of \u201ccommon notions\u201d of\nreason, especially in the domains of metaphysics and morality. These\nare first principles that form the basis of all other reasoning,\nincluding theological reasoning; without these principles, human\nreason is not only weak but entirely silent. Bayle was, therefore, a\nRationalist on this reading.\n\nWhat do we make of an author who might have been an atheist or a\nChristian, depending on how you read him; or who might have been a\nskeptic or a Rationalist, depending on your perspective? This is the\nmain outstanding problem in the Bayle literature. One compelling\nsolution is provided by Lennon\u2019s 1999 Reading Bayle.\nLennon, following the pioneering work of Jos\u00e9 R. Maia Neto\n(1999), interprets Bayle\u2019s oeuvre in the light of a\ncommitment to Academic integrity as it was expressed by Cicero in his\nwritings on the Academic skeptics. The goal of this integrity is to\nkeep one\u2019s power of judgment untrammelled; it is to keep an open\nmind. The method the Academics used to achieve this kind of\nintellectual freedom was the rigorous presentation of both sides of a\ndebate; to express competing positions not as a lawyer would do, with\nthe goal of making one side look weaker than the other, but as a\nreporter would do, allowing each side to make its best case in its own\nwords. Lennon finds a commitment to these goals and methods especially\nin the Dictionary, where Bayle quotes like a reporter far\nmore than he argues like a lawyer. The power of this Academic reading\nof Bayle is that it explains why Bayle appears to contradict himself.\nThe problem arises because readers of Bayle fail to recognize that\nBayle did not personally believe everything he wrote; sometimes he was\nmerely laying out somebody else\u2019s position for the sake of\nbalancing arguments and promoting Academic freedom of judgment. Just\nas God, the author of creation, allows creatures to conflict with each\nother and even to oppose God\u2019s owns plans for creation, so too\nBayle, the author of a vast oeuvre, allows the characters and\nphilosophical theses in his works to conflict with each other and even\nto oppose Bayle\u2019s own stated aims in his works. The Bayle\nenigma, just like Bayle\u2019s beloved problem of evil, may well be\ninsoluble because of the role played in each by the conflict between\nauthorial design and human freedom.\n",
