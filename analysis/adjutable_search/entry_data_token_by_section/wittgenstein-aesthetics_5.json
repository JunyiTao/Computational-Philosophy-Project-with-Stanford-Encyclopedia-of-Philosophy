    "main_text": "The Critique of Scientism || Aesthetic Reactions\n2.1 Aesthetic Reactions\n\n\nThe true aesthetic reaction\u2014itself rarely described in\nsitu in terms of a proximate cause (\u201cIn these cases the\nword \u2018cause\u2019 is hardly ever used at all\u201d\n[Wittgenstein 1966, 14]) is far more immediate, and far more\nintertwined with, and related to, what we see\n in[4]\n the work of art in question. \u201cIt is a reaction analogous to my\ntaking my hand away from a hot plate\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966).  He\nthus says:\n\n\nTo say: \u201cI feel discomfort and know the cause\u201d, is\nentirely misleading because \u201cknow the cause\u201d normally\nmeans something quite different. How misleading it is depends on\nwhether when you said: \u201cI know the cause\u201d, you meant it to\nbe an explanation or not. \u201cI feel discomfort and know the\ncause\u201d makes it sound as if there were two things going on in my\nsoul\u2014discomfort and knowing the cause (Wittgenstein 1966,\n14).\n\n\n\n\nBut there is, as he next says, a \u201cWhy?\u201d to such a case of\naesthetic discomfort, if not a cause (on the conventional scientific\nmodel). But both the question and its multiform answers will take,\nindeed, very different forms in different cases. Again, if what he\nsuggested before concerning the significance of context for meaning is\nright, the very meaning of the \u201cWhy?\u201d-question\nwill vary case to case. This is not a weaker thesis concerning\nvariation on the level of inflection, where the underlying structure\nof the \u201cWhy?\u201d-question is causal. No, here again that\nunifying, model-imposing manner of proceeding would leave out a\nconsideration of the nuances that give the \u201cWhy?\u201d-question\nits determinate sense in the first place.\n\n\n But again, Wittgenstein's fundamental concern here is to point out\nthe great conceptual gulf that separates aesthetic perplexities from\nthe methodology of empirical psychology. To run studies of quantified\nresponses to controlled and isolated aesthetic stimuli, where emergent\npatterns of preference, response, and judgment are recorded within a\ngiven population's sample, is to pass by the true character of the\naesthetic issue\u2014the actual puzzlement, such as we feel it, will\nbe conceptual, not empirical. And here again we see a direct link to\nhis work in the philosophy of psychology: the penultimate passage of\nPart II of Philosophical Investigations (1958, sec. xiv), was\n\u201cThe existence of the experimental method makes us think we have\nthe means of solving the problems which trouble us; though problem and\nmethod pass one another by\u201d (Wittgenstein 1958, II, iv, 232).\nHe says, near the close of this part of his lectures on aesthetics,\n\u201cAesthetic questions have nothing to do with psychological\nexperiments, but are answered in an entirely different way\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 17).  A stimulus-response model adapted from\nscientific psychology\u2014what we might now call the naturalizing of\naesthetics\u2014falsifies the genuine complexities of aesthetic\npsychology through a methodologically enforced reduction to one narrow\nand unitary conception of aesthetic engagement. For Wittgenstein\ncomplexity, and not reduction to unitary essence, is the route to\nconceptual clarification. Reduction to a simplified model, by\ncontrast, yields only the illusion of clarification in the form of\nconceptual incarceration (\u201ca picture held us\n captive\u201d).[5]\n",
