    "main_text": "From \u2018Model of Democracy\u2019 to \u2018Values of Democratization\u2019 || Examples in the Literature\n3.2 Examples in the Literature\n\n\nThere are many ways to think about pursuing values of democratization\nin world politics. One prominent example comes from recent\ninternational political theory and the work of Adrian Little and Kate\nMacdonald (2013). These authors argue that the notion of\n\u2018democratic practice\u2019 should guide global reform. This\napproach frees itself from \u2018institutionally-specific\u2019\ngoals and rather seeks \u201ca progressive process of\ndemocratization\u201d (Little and Macdonald 2013, 749). These authors\nidentify political control and popular equality as requisite values\nthat should be employed to guide social critique and\ntransformation. To the extent that individuals have more equitable\ncontrol over how transnational political power is exercised, global\ndemocratization is enhanced. A similar approach is employed by Terry\nMacdonald and Kate Macdonald (2006) in their work on democratizing\nsupply chain governance. These authors argue that global politics can\nbe democratized through a series of decentralized, non-electoral\nmechanisms that help reassert public control over decision-making.\n\n\nValues of democratization have also been promoted by international\nlawyers (Cohen and Sabel 2006). Gr\u00e1inne de B\u00farca, in a\n2008 article, advocates a \u2018democracy striving approach\u2019\nwhich highlights the dynamic and inchoateness of democracy. The basic\nidea is to identify the core principles (or \u2018building\nblocks\u2019) of democracy and strive for those values beyond the\nstate. De B\u00farca (2008, 129\u201336) identifies political\nequality, participation, and representation as key values. Nico\nKrisch, in a book from 2010, has argued that international law can be\ndemocratized by seeking accountability, deliberation, and contestation\nin different issue spaces. Krisch suggests that the heterarchical and\nuneven terrain of global legal orders actually allow these values to\ncome to the fore, and underscores this argument through case study\nanalysis of the European Human Rights regime, UN Security Council\nrulings on terrorism, and genetically modified food governance.\n\n\nFinally, several IR scholars have also contended that global affairs\ncan be democratized by pursuing democratic values in different ways.\nKarin B\u00e4ckstrand (2006), for instance, suggests that global\nclimate governance could be democratized through a stakeholder model\nwhich blends deliberation, participation, and accountability. Jonathan\nKuyper (2014) argues that different issue areas of world politics can\nlikewise be democratized by pursuing values of equal participation,\naccountability, and revisability. This argument is tested and\ndeveloped in the issue space of intellectual property rights\ngovernance.  Magdalena Bexell and her co-authors (2010) focus on the\nvalues of participation and accountability in global governance and\ndocument how non-state actors help induce (or undercut) these\ndesiderata.\n\n\nOverall, the notion that world politics can be democratized by myriad\nagents pursuing different democratic values in diverse fora has\nemerged as a nascent way to think about reducing the global democratic\ndeficit. While this approach has clear benefits, it also comes with\ncomplications. First, the lack of an institutional blueprint makes the\ndesign process much more opaque than several of the models offered\npreviously. Second, it is not immediately clear why we should seek\nsome values over others and what we should do when values conflict\nwith one another. Finally, this approach might unnecessarily reify the\nstatus quo. Without systematic and comparative analysis, proponents\nrisk \u2018cherry picking\u2019 good examples that highlight how\ndemocratic values can be attained while failing to elaborate how\nreally difficult situations can be transformed. This all indicates\nthat this turn in the literature requires much further research.\n",
