    "main_text": "The Positions || Conservatism\n1.1 Conservatism\n\nWe find ourselves naturally inclined to make certain judgments about\nwhich objects are before us in various situations. Looking at a pool\ntable just before the break, we are naturally inclined to judge there\nto be sixteen pool balls on the table, perhaps various parts of the\nindividual balls (their top and bottom halves), and no other\nmacroscopic objects. Looking at my nightstand, I am naturally inclined\nto judge there to be an alarm clock, a lamp, their various parts\n(lampshade, buttons, cords), and nothing else.\n\nConservative views are those according to which these sorts of\njudgments are by and large correct. Giving a precise characterization\nof conservatism, or of ordinary objects, is no easy task. Very\nroughly, ordinary objects are objects belonging to kinds that we are\nnaturally inclined to regard as having instances on the basis of our\nperceptual experiences: dog, tree, table,\nand so forth. Extraordinary objects, by contrast, are macroscopic\nobjects belonging to kinds that we are not ordinarily inclined to\nregard as having instances. (More on these in\n \u00a71.3.)\n And conservatism is roughly the view that there are just the ordinary\nobjects and none of the extraordinary\n objects.[1]\n\nRevisionary views about which objects there are are those that depart\nin one way or another from conservatism. These include both\neliminative views, on which there are fewer ordinary objects than are\nrecognized by conservatives, and permissive views, on which there are\nextraordinary objects that conservatives do not recognize. There is,\nhowever, some controversy about whether these departures from\nconservatism actually deserve to be called \u2018revisionary\u2019.\nAs we shall see in\n \u00a73.1,\n many eliminativists and permissivists take their views to be entirely\ncompatible with common sense and ordinary belief.\n\nOur target question\u2014namely, which macroscopic objects\nexist\u2014may be distinguished from related but independent\nquestions concerning the nature of ordinary objects. Some\nviews about the natures of objects may seem to be at odds with common\nsense, for instance, the view that ordinary objects can\u2019t\nsurvive the loss of any of their parts, or that ordinary objects are\nall mind-dependent. But these views are entirely compatible with\nconservatism, as characterized above, because they do not (or at least\nneed not) have any revisionary implications regarding which\nobjects there are at a given place and time. That said, questions\nabout the nature of ordinary objects are intimately connected with\nquestions about which objects exist, insofar as certain views about\nthe nature of these objects (including those just mentioned) provide\nthe resources for addressing some of the puzzles and arguments that\nmotivate revisionary conceptions.\n\nA few terminological preliminaries. \u2018Object\u2019 is used in\nits narrow sense, which applies only to individual material objects\nand not to other sorts of entities like numbers or events.\n\u2018Part\u2019 is used in its ordinary sense, on which it is not\ntrue\u2014or at least not trivially true\u2014that things are parts\nof themselves. And when the entry notes that some objects compose\nsomething, or that they have a fusion, what is meant is that there is\nsomething that has each of them as parts and every part of which\noverlaps at least one of them. The entry avoids the word\n\u2018sum\u2019, but newcomers to this literature should bear in\nmind that it gets used in different ways: \u2018sum of x and y\u2019\nis sometimes used to mean object that is composed of x and y\nand is other times used to mean object that is composed of x and y\nand that has all of its parts\n essentially.[2]\n1.2. Eliminativism\n\nEliminative views are those that deny the existence of some wide range\nof ordinary objects. (Denying merely that ordinary objects are\nfundamental is not by itself enough to qualify as an eliminativist;\nsee\n \u00a74\n below.)\n\nSome eliminativists accept nihilism, the thesis that no objects ever\ncompose anything. In other words, every object is mereologically\nsimple (i.e., partless). Together with the plausible assumption that\nordinary objects (if they exist) are all composite objects, nihilism\nentails that there are no ordinary objects. Nihilists typically accept\nthat there are countless microscopic objects: although there are\n\u201csimples arranged dogwise\u201d and \u201csimples arranged\nstatuewise\u201d, there are no dogs or statues. But nihilism is also\ncompatible with existence monism\u2014the thesis that there is a\nsingle, all-encompassing simple (the cosmos, a.k.a. \u201cthe\nblobject\u201d)\u2014as well as the extreme nihilist thesis that\nthere are no objects\n whatsoever.[3]\n\nSince many of the arguments for eliminativism actually fall short of\nestablishing that composition never occurs, it is also open to\neliminativists to reject nihilism and accept certain classes of\ncomposites. Many eliminativists make an exception for persons and\nother organisms. Some, for instance, accept organicism, the thesis\nthat some objects compose something just in case the activities of\nthose objects constitute a life. In other words, organisms are the\nonly composite\n objects.[4]\n\nThe motivations for making an exception for organisms vary. Van\nInwagen (1990: Ch. 12) accepts organicism on the grounds that it\nyields the best answer to the special composition question\n(\u201cunder what conditions do some objects compose\nsomething?\u201d), one that allows for one\u2019s own existence and\nphysicality, while at the same time escaping various problems that\narise for competing answers. Merricks (2001: Ch. 4) argues that\npersons and some other composites must be recognized on account of\ntheir nonredundant causal powers. Making such exceptions naturally\ngives rise to concerns about the stability of the resulting positions,\neither because the reasoning behind allowing the exceptions threatens\nto generalize to all ordinary objects or because the arguments for\neliminating ordinary objects threaten to generalize to the objects one\nwishes to\n permit.[5]\n\nIt is also open to eliminativists to adopt non-nihilistic views that\nare fairly liberal about composition, allowing that composition occurs\nat least as often as we ordinarily suppose (if not more so). Peter\nUnger is one such non-nihilistic eliminativist:\n\nThere is nothing in these arguments [for eliminativism] to deny the\nidea, common enough, that there are physical objects with a diameter\ngreater than four feet and less than five. Indeed, the exhibited\n[arguments] allow us still to maintain that there are physical objects\nof a variety of shapes and sizes, and with various particular spatial\nrelations and velocities with respect to each other. It is simply that\nno such objects will be ordinary things; none are stones or planets or\npieces of furniture. (1979b: 150)\n\n\nWhile Unger does use the label \u2018nihilism\u2019 for his view, he\nis not a nihilist in our sense because he affirms that there is a\nhighly visible composite object occupying the exact location where we\ntake the table to be. He is, however, an eliminativist insofar as he\ndenies that that object is a\n table.[6]\n1.3 Permissivism\n\nPermissive views are those according to which there are wide swathes\nof extraordinary objects.\n\nUniversalism is the permissivist thesis that composition is\nunrestricted: for any objects, there is a single object that is\ncomposed of those objects. What universalism does not tell us is which\nkinds of objects there are. Whenever there are some atoms\narranged turkeywise, universalism entails that there is some\nobject that they compose. But it remains open to universalists (like\nthe aforementioned non-nihilistic eliminativists) to deny that this\ncomposite is a turkey. However, assuming that there are such objects\nas turkeys, trout, and their front and back halves, universalism will\nentail that there are trout-turkeys, where a trout-turkey is a single\nobject composed of the undetached front half of a trout and the\nundetached back half of a turkey. These are objects that have both\nfins and feathers and whose finned parts may be a good distance from\ntheir feathered\n parts.[7]\n\nDiachronic universalism is the permissivist thesis that, for any times\nand any function from those times to sets of objects that exist at\nthose times, there is an object that exists at just those times and\nhas exactly those parts at those times. Roughly: there is an object\ncorresponding to every filled region of spacetime. So, assuming that\nyour kitchen table and living room table both exist, there also exists\na klable: an object that\u2019s entirely made up of your kitchen\ntable every day from midnight till noon and is entirely made up of\nyour living room table from noon till midnight. This is an object\nthat, twice a day, instantly and imperceptibly shifts its\n location.[8]\n\nSome accept even more plenitudinous forms of permissivism.\nFormulations vary, but the rough idea is that, so long as the\nempirical facts don\u2019t rule out there being an object with a\ngiven modal property in a given location, then there is an object in\nthat location with that modal property. When there is a red car parked\nin the garage, the empirical facts (e.g., that there is nothing blue\nthere) do rule out there being an object in the exact location of the\ncar that is necessarily blue. But they do not rule out there being an\nobject colocated with the car that is inside the garage as a matter of\nmetaphysical necessity (an \u201cincar\u201d) and that would cease to exist if\nthe car were to leave the\n garage.[9]\n\nOne further way of being a permissivist is by permitting a multitude\nof parts of ordinary objects that we do not naturally judge\nthem to have. For instance, one might hold that, in addition to\nordinary parts like arms and legs, you have extraordinary parts like\nleg complements, where your left-leg complement is an object made up\nof all of you except for your left leg. Together with some natural\nassumptions (e.g., about regions of space), leg complements and a\nlegion of other extraordinary parts will be delivered by the doctrine\nof arbitrary undetached parts\u2014or DAUP\u2014the thesis that for\nany material object o, if r is the region of space occupied by o, and\nif r\u2032 is an occupiable sub-region of r, then there exists a\nmaterial object that exactly occupies r\u2032 and which is part of o.\n(Roughly: for every region of space within the boundaries of a given a\nobject, that object has a part that exactly fills that\n region.)[10]\n2. Against Conservative Ontologies\n2.1 Sorites Arguments\n\nSorites arguments proceed from a premise to the effect that minute\ndifferences cannot make a difference with respect to whether some\nproperty F (or kind K) is instantiated to the conclusion that nothing\n(or everything) is F (or a K). Here is a sorites argument for the\nelimination of stones:\n\n(SR1)\nEvery stone is composed of a finite number of atoms.\n(SR2)\nIt is impossible for something composed of fewer than two atoms to\nbe a stone.\n(SR3)\nFor any number n, if it is impossible for an object composed of n\natoms to be a stone, then it is impossible for an object composed of\nn+1 atoms to be a stone.\n(SR4)\nSo, there are no stones.\n\n\nPremises SR2 and SR3 together entail that, for any finite number of\natoms, nothing made up of that many atoms is a stone. But this,\ntogether with SR1, entails that there are no\n stones.[11]\n\n\nSimilar arguments may be given for the elimination of individual\nordinary objects. One can construct a sorites series of contiguous\nbits of matter, running from a bit of matter, mk, at the\npeak of Kilimanjaro to a bit of matter, mp, in the\nsurrounding plains. From the sorites premise that a bit of matter\nthat\u2019s n inches along the path from mp to\nmk is part of Kilimanjaro iff a bit of matter that\u2019s\nn+1 inches along the path is part of Kilimanjaro (for any number n),\ntogether with the fact that mp is not part of Kilimanjaro,\nwe reach the absurd conclusion that mk isn\u2019t part of\nKilimanjaro. So, by reductio, we may conclude that Kilimanjaro does\nnot\n exist.[12]\n\n\nWhy accept SR3? Imagine a series of cases, beginning with a case\ninvolving a single atom and terminating with a case involving what\nwould seem to be a paradigm stone, where each case differs from the\npreceding case only by the addition of a single atom. It seems highly\nimplausible that there should be adjacent cases in any such series\nwhere there is a stone in one case but not in the other. Rejecting SR3\nwould look to commit one to just such a sharp cut-off.\n\nBut one can deny that SR3 is true without accepting that there is a\nsharp transition from stones to non-stones in such series, that is,\nwithout accepting that there is some specific object in the series\nthat definitely is a stone and whose successor definitely is not a\nstone. For one may instead hold that there is a range of cases in\nwhich it is vague whether the object in question is a\n stone.[13]\n\n\nHere is an illustration of how that sort of strategy might go. Let S\nbe some object in the series that clearly seems to be a stone, let NS\nbe an object that clearly seems to be a non-stone, and let BS be an\nobject that seems to be a borderline case of being a stone. One might\nsuggest that \u2018stone\u2019 is vague as a result of there being a\nrange of candidate precise meanings (or\n\u201cprecisifications\u201d) for the word \u2018stone\u2019,\n\n(i)\n all of which apply to S,\n (ii)\n none of which apply to NS,\n (iii)\n some but not all of which apply to BS, and\n (iv)\n none of which is definitely the meaning of\n\u2018stone\u2019.\n\n\n\u2018S is a stone\u2019 is true because S falls under all of these\nprecisifications of \u2018stone\u2019. \u2018NS is a stone\u2019\nis false because NS doesn\u2019t fall under any of them. And\n\u2018BS is a stone\u2019 is neither true nor false because BS falls\nunder some but not all of the precisifications. And then SR3 itself\nturns out to be false: on every precisification of\n\u2018stone\u2019, there is some object in the series such that it\nbut not its successor falls under that precisification. (This is\nsometimes known as a \u201csupervaluationist\u201d account.)\n\nDefenders of sorites arguments often complain that this line of\nresponse still commits one to some \u201csharp status\ntransition\u201d, for instance, a sharp transition from a case in\nwhich \u2018there is a stone\u2019 is true to a case in which it is\nneither true nor\n false.[14]\n2.2 The Argument from Vagueness\n\nIt is natural to suppose that objects sometimes do, and other times do\nnot, compose a further object. When a hammer head is firmly affixed to\na handle, they compose something, namely, a hammer. When they\u2019re\non opposite ends of the room, they don\u2019t compose anything. The\nfollowing argument\u2014known as \u201cthe argument from\nvagueness\u201d\u2014purports to show that this natural assumption\nis mistaken.\n\n(AV1)\nIf some pluralities of objects compose something and others do\nnot, then it is possible for there to be a sorites series for\ncomposition.\n(AV2)\nAny such sorites series must contain either an exact cut-off or\nborderline cases of composition.\n(AV3)\nThere cannot be exact cut-offs in such sorites series.\n(AV4)\nThere cannot be borderline cases of composition.\n(AV5)\nSo, either every plurality of objects composes something or none\ndo.\n\n\nIf the argument is sound then either universalism or nihilism must be\ncorrect, though which of them is correct would have to be decided on\nindependent\n grounds.[15]\n\n\nA sorites series for composition is a series of cases running from a\ncase in which composition doesn\u2019t occur to a case in which\ncomposition does occur, where adjacent cases are extremely similar in\nall of the respects that one would ordinarily take to be relevant to\nwhether composition occurs (e.g., the spatial and causal relations\namong the objects in question). Understood in this way, AV1 should be\nunobjectionable. If it\u2019s true that the handle and head compose\nsomething only once the hammer is assembled, then a moment-by-moment\nseries of cases running from the beginning to the end of the assembly\nof the hammer would be just such a series. Premise AV2 looks trivial:\nany such series obviously must contain some transition from\ncomposition not occurring to composition occurring, and there either\nwill or won\u2019t be a determinate fact of the matter about where\nexactly that transition occurs in any given series.\n\nAV3 is plausible as well. If composition occurs in one case but not in\nanother, then surely there must be some explanation for why that is.\nIn other words, the facts about composition are not\n\u201cbrute\u201d. Yet the sorts of differences that one finds among\nadjacent cases in a sorites series for composition\u2014for instance,\nthat the handle and head are a fraction of a centimeter closer\ntogether in the one than in the other\u2014can\u2019t plausibly\nexplain why composition occurs in one case but not in the\n other.[16]\n\nCertain sorts of eliminativists are well positioned to resist AV3\nwithout having to accept that compositional facts are brute. Suppose,\nfor instance, that one accepts a view on which conscious beings are\nthe only composite objects. Such eliminativists will deny that there\nis a sorites series for composition running from the beginning to the\nend of the assembly process, since they will deny that anything is\ncomposed of the handle and head (or that there are a handle\nand head) even at the end of the series. Every sorites series for\ncomposition, by their lights, will have to run from a case involving a\nconscious being to one that doesn\u2019t. And assuming that that\nthere can\u2019t be borderline cases of consciousness, every such\nseries will contain a sharp cut-off with respect to the presence of\nthe additional subject of consciousness. This, in turn, is poised to\nexplain why composition occurs in the one case but not the\n other.[17]\n\n\nWhy, though, should anyone accept AV4? On the face of it, it seems\njust as clear that there can be borderline cases of composition (e.g.,\nwhen the hammer head is just beginning to be affixed to the handle) as\nit is that there can be borderline cases of redness and baldness. This\nis not, however, \u201cjust another sorites,\u201d to be blocked in\nwhichever way one blocks the sorites arguments in \u00a72.1.\nThat\u2019s because questions about when composition occurs look to\nbe intimately bound up with questions about how many objects exist.\nThis suggests the following line of argument in defense of AV4, no\nanalogue of which is available for other sorts of sorites\n arguments.[18]\n\n(AV6)\n If there can be borderline cases of composition, then it can be\nindeterminate how many objects exist.\n(AV7)\nIt cannot be indeterminate how many objects exist.\n(AV4)\nSo, there cannot be borderline cases of composition.\n\n\nTo see the motivation for AV6, notice that if the handle and head do\ncompose something then there are three things: the handle, the head,\nand a hammer. If they don\u2019t, then there are only two things: the\nhandle and head. And if it is vague whether they do, then it will be\nvague whether there are two things or three. As for AV7, notice that\none can specify how many objects there are using what would seem to be\nentirely precise vocabulary. For any finite number, one can produce a\n\u201cnumerical sentence\u201d saying that there are exactly that\nmany concrete objects. Here, for instance, is the numerical sentence\nfor two: \u2018\u2203x\u2203y(x\u2260y & Cx & Cy &\n\u2200z(Cz\u2192(x=z \u2228 y=z)))\u2019. (The restriction to\nconcreta ensures that numerical sentences aren\u2019t trivially false\nsimply on account of there being infinitely many numbers, sets, and so\nforth.) And since these numerical sentences contain no vague\nvocabulary, it would seem to follow that it cannot be indeterminate\nhow many objects there are.\n\nAV6 can be resisted by denying that composition affects the number of\nobjects in the way suggested. For instance, one might contend that\neven before the handle and head definitely come to compose something,\nthere exists an object\u2014a\n\u201cproto-hammer\u201d\u2014located in the region that the two of\nthem jointly occupy. The proto-hammer definitely exists, but it is a\nborderline case of composition: it is indeterminate whether the handle\nand head compose the proto-hammer or whether they instead compose\nnothing at all (in which case the proto-hammer has no\n parts).[19]\n\nAlternatively, one might resist AV7 by pinning the vagueness on the\nquantifiers in the numerical sentence. After all, what seems to be\nvague is whether the handle and head are everything that\nthere is and whether there is something other than\nthe handle and head. But it is difficult to see how the quantifiers\ncan be vague and, in particular, how their vagueness could be\naccounted for on the sort of standard, precisificational account of\nvagueness discussed in\n \u00a72.1.[20]\n\n2.3 Material Constitution\n\nOrdinary objects are constituted by, or made up out of, aggregates of\nmatter. A gold ring is constituted by a certain piece of gold. Clay\nstatues are constituted by pieces of clay. We are naturally inclined\nto regard the statue and the piece of clay as being one and the same\nobject, an object that simply belongs to multiple kinds\n(statue and piece of clay).\n\nThe puzzles of material constitution put pressure on this natural\ninclination. Here is one such puzzle. Let \u2018Athena\u2019 name a\ncertain clay statue and let \u2018Piece\u2019 name the piece of clay\nthat constitutes it. What is puzzling is that all of the following\nseem true:\n\n(MC1)\nAthena exists and Piece exists.\n(MC2)\nIf Athena exists and Piece exists, then Athena = Piece.\n(MC3)\nAthena has different properties from Piece.\n(MC4)\nIf Athena has different properties from Piece, then Athena \u2260\nPiece.\n\n\nThe motivation behind MC2 is that Athena seemingly has exactly the\nsame location and exactly the same parts as Piece. So\n\u2018Athena\u2019 and \u2018Piece\u2019 are plausibly just\ndifferent names for the same thing. The motivation behind MC3 is that\nPiece and Athena seem to have different modal properties: Piece is\nable to survive being flattened and Athena isn\u2019t. MC4 follows\nfrom the Principle of the Indiscernibility of Identicals (a.k.a.\nLeibniz\u2019s Law): \u2200x\u2200y(x=y \u2192 \u2200P(Px iff\nPy)). In other words, if x and y are identical, then they had better\nhave all the same properties. After all, if they are identical, then\nthere is only one thing there to have or lack any given\n property.[21]\n\n\nThe puzzles are sometimes taken to motivate eliminativism, since\neliminativists can simply deny MC1: there are no statues (and perhaps\nno pieces of clay\n either).[22]\n\n\nMore often, however, the puzzles are taken to motivate constitutional\npluralism, the thesis that ordinary objects are typically, if not\nalways, distinct from the aggregates of matter that constitute them.\n(\u2018Typically\u2019 because, in rare cases in which the ordinary\nobject and the aggregate come into existence at the same time and\ncease to exist at the same time, some pluralists will take the\nordinary object to be identical to the aggregate.) Pluralists reject\nMC2: clay statues are not identical to the pieces of clay that\nconstitute them. Pluralists may deny that having the same parts at a\ngiven time suffices for identity, or they may instead deny that the\nstatue and the piece of clay have all of the same\n parts.[23]\n\n\nOne of the main problems facing the pluralist solution is the\ngrounding problem: the modal differences between Athena and Piece\n(e.g., that the one but not the other can survive being flattened)\nseem to stand in need of explanation and yet there seems to be no\nfurther difference between them that is poised to explain, or ground,\nthese\n differences.[24]\n\nDefenders of the pluralist response to these puzzles may, by similar\nreasoning, be led to accept that, in special cases, two objects of the\nsame kind can coincide. Suppose, for instance, that we have a\nfantastically big net (Thin) with very thin netting. We then roll it\nup into a long rope, and we weave that rope into a smaller net (Thick)\nwith a thicker weave. Since the nets intuitively have different modal\nproperties\u2014Thin, but not Thick, can survive the unraveling of\nthe thicker net\u2014the same sort of reasoning that leads one to\nreject MC2 underwrites an argument that the nets are not identical. In\nother words, there are two exactly colocated objects, both of which\nare\n nets.[25]\n\nConstitutional monists, according to whom Athena is identical to\nPiece, will deny MC3. There are various ways of developing the monist\nresponse. First, one might insist that both Athena and Piece (which,\non this view, are identical) can survive flattening: upon flattening,\nAthena ceases to be a statue, but does not cease to exist. We can call\nthose who opt for this approach \u2018phasalists\u2019, since they\ntake being a statue to be a temporary phase that Piece (i.e.,\nAthena) is passing\n through.[26]\n\nAlternatively, monists might deny that Piece (i.e., Athena) can\nsurvive being flattened. When Piece is flattened, Piece ceases to\nexist, at which point an entirely new piece of clay (composed of the\nsame atoms) comes into existence. This strategy is sometimes called\n\u201cthe doctrine of dominant kinds\u201d, since the idea is that\nwhen an object belongs to multiple kinds, the object has the\npersistence conditions associated with whichever of the kinds\n\u201cdominates\u201d the others. Because statue dominates\npiece, Piece is a statue essentially, and therefore cannot\nsurvive ceasing to be\n statue-shaped.[27]\n\nFinally, monists might agree that Piece is able to survive being\nflattened and that Athena is not able to survive being flattened, and\nyet deny that Athena and Piece have different properties. How can that\nbe? On one version of this approach (often associated with counterpart\ntheory), the idea is that \u2018is able to survive being\nflattened\u2019 is context-sensitive, expressing one property when\naffixed to \u2018Athena\u2019 and another when affixed to\n\u2018Piece\u2019. On another, the idea is that \u2018is able to\nsurvive being flattened\u2019 does not express a property at all.\nEither way, we do not end up with any one property that Piece has but\nAthena\n lacks.[28]\n\n2.4 Indeterminate Identity\n\nA wooden ship is constructed and christened \u2018Theseus II\u2019.\nAs planks come loose over the years, they are discarded and replaced.\nAfter three hundred years, the last of the original planks is\nreplaced. Call the resulting ship \u2018the mended ship\u2019. The\ndescendants of the original owners have been collecting the discarded\noriginal planks, and\u2014three hundred years after the\nchristening\u2014they obtain the last of them and construct a ship\nthat is indistinguishable from the original. Call the resulting ship\n\u2018the reconstructed ship\u2019. Which, if either, of these two\nships is identical to Theseus II? It is natural to suppose that there\nis no fact of the matter: it is indeterminate which of the two ships\nis Theseus II.\n\nHowever, there arguably can never be indeterminate cases of\nidentity:\n\n(ST1)\nSuppose that it is indeterminate whether Theseus II = the mended\nship.\n(ST2)\nIf so, then Theseus II has the property of being indeterminately\nidentical to the mended ship.\n(ST3)\nThe mended ship does not have the property of being\nindeterminately identical to the mended ship.\n(ST4)\nIf Theseus II has this property and the mended ship lacks this\nproperty, then Theseus II \u2260 the mended ship.\n(ST5)\nIf Theseus II \u2260 the mended ship, then it isn\u2019t\nindeterminate whether Theseus II = the mended ship.\n(ST6)\nSo (by reductio), it isn\u2019t indeterminate whether Theseus II\n= the mended ship.\n\n\nST2 relies on two seemingly innocuous inferences: (a) from its being\nindeterminate whether Theseus II is identical to the mended ship to\nTheseus II\u2019s being indeterminately identical to the mended ship\nand (b) from there to Theseus II\u2019s having the property of being\nindeterminately identical to the mended ship. ST3 seems trivial as\nwell: the mended ship is definitely self-identical, so it does not\nitself have this property. ST4 looks to be an immediate consequence of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law: if Theseus II and the mended ship differ with\nrespect to even one property, then they are distinct. ST5 is trivial:\nif they\u2019re not identical, then it isn\u2019t indeterminate\nwhether they are\n identical.[29]\n\n\nEliminativists may go on to argue from ST6 to the conclusion that\nthere are no ships, as follows. If indeed it isn\u2019t indeterminate\nwhether Theseus II is the mended ship, then there would seem to be\nfive options:\n\n(i)\nTheseus II is identical only to the mended ship.\n (ii)\nTheseus II is identical only to the reconstructed ship.\n (iii)\n Theseus II is identical both to the mended ship and to the\nreconstructed ship.\n (iv)\nTheseus II is neither ship; it has ceased to exist.\n(v)\nTheseus II never existed in the first place; there are no\nships.\n\n\nOptions (i) and (ii) seem intolerably arbitrary, since the mended ship\nand reconstructed ship seem to have equal claim to being Theseus II.\nOption (iii) is out as well. If Theseus II is identical to both ships,\nthen (by the transitivity of identity) they must be identical to one\nanother; but they cannot be identical because they have different\nproperties (e.g., the one but not the other is composed of the\noriginal planks). Option (iv) is problematic as well. The history of\nmaintenance by itself would have sufficed for the persistence of\nTheseus II; the preservation and reassembly of the original parts by\nitself would likewise have sufficed for the persistence of Theseus II;\nand here we have managed to secure both. As Parfit (1971: 5) would\nsay, \u201cHow could a double success be a failure?\u201d Thus, we\nget (v) from argument by elimination.\n Fitting.[30]\n\nSome respond to the argument by maintaining that it is indeterminate\nwhich of various objects \u2018Theseus II\u2019 picks out. If\nthat\u2019s right, then ST2 is arguably false. One cannot infer the\nexistence of an individual who is indeterminately identical to Sue\nfrom the fact that it is indeterminate whether Sue (or rather Morgan)\nis Harry\u2019s best friend. Analogously, one cannot infer the\nexistence of an individual that is indeterminately identical to the\nmended ship from the fact that it is indeterminate whether Theseus II\nis the mended\n ship.[31]\n\n\nThe prima facie problem with this response is that there do not seem\nto be multiple objects such that it\u2019s indeterminate which one\n\u2018Theseus II\u2019 picks out. After all, when \u2018Theseus\nII\u2019 was first introduced, there was only one ship around to\nreceive the name! One can address this problem by maintaining that,\ndespite appearances, two ships were present at the christening: one\nthat would later be composed of entirely different planks and another\nthat would later be reassembled from a pile of discarded planks. What\nis indeterminate is which of these two temporarily colocated ships was\nchristened \u2018Theseus\n II\u2019.[32]\n\nOther responses are available. One might deny ST2 on the grounds that\nthere is no such property as the property of being indeterminately\nidentical to Theseus II. One might deny ST3, affirming that the mended\nship is indeterminately identical to the mended ship. One might deny\nST4 by denying that the distinctness of Theseus II and the mended ship\ncan be inferred from the fact that they do not share the indicated\nproperty. Or one might embrace option (iv), on the (stage-theoretic)\ngrounds that the ship that existed at the time of the christening is\nnot identical to any ship that exists at any earlier or later time.\n [33]\n2.5 Arbitrariness Arguments\n\nArguments from arbitrariness turn on the observation that there would\nseem to be no ontologically significant difference between certain\nordinary and extraordinary objects, that is, no difference between\nthem that can account for why there would be things of the one kind\nbut not the other. Here is an example (drawn from Hawthorne 2006:\nvii):\n\n(AR1)\nThere are islands.\n(AR2)\nThere is no ontologically significant difference between islands\nand incars.\n(AR3)\nIf there is no ontologically significant difference between\nislands and incars, then: if there are islands then there are\nincars.\n(AR4)\nSo, there are incars.\n\n\nThe idea behind AR2 is that islands and incars (see\n \u00a71.3)\n would seem to be objects of broadly the same sort, namely, objects\nthat go out of existence simply by virtue of changing their\norientation with respect to some other thing (the water level in the\none case, the garage in the other), without their constitutive matter\nundergoing any intrinsic change. The idea behind AR3 is that, if there\ntruly are islands but no incars, then this is something that would\nseem to stand in need of explanation: there would have to be something\nin virtue of which it\u2019s the case. To think otherwise would be to\ntake the facts about what exists to be arbitrary in a way that they\nplausibly are not.\n\nSimilar arguments may be used to establish the existence of leg\ncomplements (on the grounds that there\u2019s no ontologically\nsignificant difference between them and legs) and trout-turkeys (on\nthe grounds that there\u2019s no ontologically significant difference\nbetween them and scattered objects like solar\n systems).[34]\n\n\nEliminativists may of course resist the argument by denying\n AR1.[35]\n\n\nThe argument may also be resisted by denying AR2 and identifying some\nontologically significant difference between islands and incars. For\ninstance, a certain sort of anti-realist will say that which objects\nthere are is largely determined by which objects we take there to be.\nAccordingly, the very fact that we take there to be islands but not\nincars marks an ontologically significant difference between them.\nAlternatively, one may attempt to identify an ontologically\nsignificant difference between the ordinary and extraordinary objects\nwithout endorsing anti-realism. In the case at hand, one might resist\nAR2 by insisting that islands have importantly different persistence\nconditions from incars. Incars are meant to cease to exist when their\nmatter ceases to be inside a garage. But islands, contra hypothesis,\ndo not cease to exist when they are completely submerged; they merely\ncease to be\n islands.[36]\n\nHow about AR3? Part of why it seems arbitrary to countenance islands\nbut not incars is that one would seem to be privileging islands over\nincars by virtue of taking them to exist. For this reason, proponents\nof certain deflationary ontological views are well positioned to deny\nAR3. Relativists, for instance, may maintain that islands exist and\nincars do not exist\u2014relative to our conceptual scheme, that is.\nRelative to other, equally good schemes, incars exist and islands do\nnot. Quantifier variantists, who maintain that there are counterparts\nof our quantifiers that are on a par with ours and that range over\nthings that do not exist\u2014but rather exist*\u2014may maintain\nthat islands exist but do not exist* while incars exist* but do not\nexist. On such views, islands and incars receive a uniform treatment\nat bottom; islands are not getting any sort of \u201cspecial\ntreatment\u201d that cries out for\n explanation.[37]\n\n2.6 Debunking Arguments\n\nWe encounter some atoms arranged treewise and some atoms arranged\ndogwise, and we naturally take there to be a dog and a tree. But there\nare different ways we might have carved up such a situation into\nobjects. Instead of taking there to be a tree there, we might instead\nhave taken there to be a trog: a partly furry, partly wooden object\ncomposed of the dog and the tree-trunk.\n\nWhy, though, do we naturally take there to trees rather than trogs?\nPlausibly, this is largely the result of various biological and\ncultural contingencies. If so, then there arguably is little reason to\nexpect that our beliefs about which objects there are would be even\napproximately correct. This realization, in turn, is meant to debunk\nour beliefs about which objects there are:\n\n(DK1)\nThere is no explanatory connection between how we believe the\nworld to be divided up into objects the how the world actually is\ndivided up into objects.\n(DK2)\nIf so, then it would be a coincidence if our object beliefs turned\nout to be correct.\n(DK3)\nIf it would be a coincidence if our object beliefs turned out to\nbe correct, then we shouldn\u2019t believe that there are trees.\n(DK4)\nSo, we shouldn\u2019t believe that there are trees.\n\n\nThe idea behind DK1 is that we are inclined to believe in trees rather\nthan trogs largely because prevailing conventions in the communities\nwe were born into generally prohibit treating some things as the parts\nof a single object unless they are connected or in some other way\nunified. These conventions themselves likely trace back to an innate\ntendency to perceive only certain arrays of qualities as being borne\nby a single object and its being adaptive for creatures like us to so\nperceive the world. But the facts about which distributions of atoms\ndo compose something, or about which arrays of qualities truly are\nborne by a single object, have no role to play in explaining why this\nis adaptive. Thus, it would seem that we divide up the world into\nobjects the way that we do for reasons having nothing at all to do\nwith how the world actually is divided up.\n\nThe idea behind DK2 is that if there truly is this sort of disconnect\nbetween the object facts and the factors that lead us to our object\nbeliefs, then it could only be a lucky coincidence if those factors\nled us to beliefs that lined up with the object facts. And the idea\nbehind DK3 is that since we have no rational grounds for believing\nthat we got lucky, we shouldn\u2019t believe that we did, in which\ncase we should suspend our beliefs about which objects there are and,\nin particular, our belief that there are\n trees.[38]\n\n\nSuch debunking arguments fall short of establishing that eliminativism\nis true or that conservatism is false. But, if successful, they do\nlend powerful support to eliminativism, by effectively neutralizing\nany reasons we might take ourselves to have for accepting conservatism\nor for wanting to resist the arguments for\n eliminativism.[39]\n\nThe arguments also lend indirect support to permissivism, insofar as\npermissivists are well positioned to deny DK2. By permissivist lights,\nhaving accurate beliefs about which kinds of objects there are is a\ntrivial accomplishment (not a coincidence), since there are objects\nanswering to virtually every way that we might have perceptually and\nconceptually divided up a situation into objects. The ordinary and\nextraordinary objects are all already out there waiting to be noticed;\nall that our conventions do is determine which ones are selected for\n attention.[40]\n\nDeflationists also seem well positioned to deny DK2. Relativists will\nsay that, while we could easily have divided up the world differently,\nwe could not easily had divided up the world incorrectly. For had we\ndivided the world into trogs rather than trees, we would then have had\na different conceptual scheme, and we would have correctly believed\nthat trogs exist-relative-to-that-scheme. Quantifier variantists will\nsay that, had we divided the world into trogs but not trees, we would\nthen have correctly believed that trogs\n exist*.[41]\n\nAlternatively, one might try to resist DK1 by identifying an\nexplanatory connection between the way the world is divided up and our\nbeliefs about how it is divided up. For instance, one might say that\nwe have the object beliefs that we do as a result of intelligent\ndesign: God, wanting us to have largely accurate beliefs, arranged for\nus to have experiences that represent trees and not trogs. Or one\nmight take a rationalist line, according to which, through some\ncapacity for rational insight, we intellectually apprehend relevant\nfacts about which objects together compose something. Or one might opt\nfor an anti-realist line and insist that there is a mind-to-world\nexplanatory connection: object beliefs determine the object facts and\nare therefore an excellent guide to which kinds\n exist.[42]\n2.7 Overdetermination Arguments\n\nOverdetermination arguments aim to establish that ordinary objects of\nvarious kinds do not exist, by way of showing that there is no\ndistinctive causal work for them to do. Here is one such argument:\n\n(OD1)\nEvery event caused by a baseball is caused by atoms arranged\nbaseballwise.\n(OD2)\nNo event caused by atoms arranged baseballwise is caused by a\nbaseball.\n(OD3)\nSo, no events are caused by baseballs.\n(OD4)\nIf no events are caused by baseballs, then baseballs do not\nexist.\n(OD5)\nSo, baseballs do not\n exist.[43]\n\n\nFor the purposes of this argument, \u2018atoms\u2019 may be\nunderstood as a placeholder for whichever microscopic objects or stuff\nfeature in the best microphysical explanations of observable reality.\nThese may turn out to be the composite atoms of chemistry, they may be\nmereological simples, or they may even be a nonparticulate\n\u201cquantum froth\u201d.\n\nOne could resist OD1 by maintaining that some things that are caused\nby baseballs are not also caused by their atoms. On one way of\ndeveloping this line of response, baseballs \u201ctrump\u201d their\natoms: atoms arranged baseballwise can\u2019t collectively cause\nanything to happen so long as they\u2019re parts of the baseball. On\nanother, there is a division of causal labor: baseballs cause events\ninvolving macroscopic items like the shattering of windows, while\ntheir atoms cause events involving microscopic items like the\nscatterings of atoms arranged windowwise. Both strategies, however,\nlook to be in tension with the plausible claim that there is a\ncomplete causal explanation for every physical event wholly in terms\nof microphysical items. Moreover, this line of response would seem to\nrequire that baseballs have emergent properties\u2014causally\nefficacious properties that cannot be accounted for in terms of the\nproperties of their atomic parts\u2014which seems\n implausible.[44]\n\nOD2 can be motivated as follows:\n\n(OD6)\nIf an event is caused by a baseball and by atoms arranged\nbaseballwise, then the event is overdetermined by the baseball and\natoms arranged baseballwise.\n(OD7)\nNo event is overdetermined by a baseball and atoms arranged\nbaseballwise.\n(OD2)\nSo, no event caused by atoms arranged baseballwise is caused by a\nbaseball.\n\n\nLet us say that an event e is overdetermined by o1 and\no2 just in case:\n\n(i)\n o1 causes e,\n (ii)\n o2 causes e,\n (iii)\n o1 is not causally relevant to\no2\u2019s causing e, \n (iv)\n o2 is not causally relevant to\no1\u2019s causing e, and\n (v)\n o1\u2260 o2.\n\n\nThis can be taken as a stipulation about how\n\u2018overdetermined\u2019 is to be understood in the argument, thus\npreempting nebulous debates about whether satisfying these five\nconditions suffices for \u201creal\u201d or \u201cgenuine\u201d\noverdetermination. To say that o1 is causally relevant to\no2\u2019s causing e is to say that o1 enters\ninto the explanation of how o2 causes e to occur in one of\nthe following ways: by causing o2 to cause e, by being\ncaused by o2 to cause e, by jointly causing e together with\no2, or\u2014where o2 is a plurality of\nobjects\u2014by being one of\n them.[45]\n\n\nCan OD6 be resisted? The idea would have to be that, although some\nevents are caused both by atoms and by baseballs composed of those\natoms, those events are not overdetermined (in the indicated sense).\nBut if they are not overdetermined, then which of the five conditions\nfor overdetermination do the baseball and the atoms fail to meet? This\nline of response takes for granted that (i) and (ii) are satisfied.\nAnd it is extremely plausible that (iii) and (iv) would be satisfied\nas well. However it is that baseballs \u201cget in on the\naction\u201d, it isn\u2019t by entering into the causal explanation\nof how the atoms manage to cause things. Baseballs\ndon\u2019t cause their atoms to shatter windows, nor do their atoms\ncause them to shatter windows. So those who would deny OD6 will need\nto deny that condition (v) is satisfied, by taking the baseball to be\nidentical to the atoms. See\n \u00a73.3\n below for discussion of the thesis that objects are identical to\ntheir various parts.\n\nWhy accept OD7? In certain cases, overdetermination strikes us as an\novert violation of Ockham\u2019s Razor: do not multiply entities\nbeyond necessity. But given the intimate connection between baseballs\nand their atoms, it is natural to feel that even if these do count as\ncases of overdetermination (in the indicated sense), this isn\u2019t\nan especially objectionable sort of overdetermination. One may then\nattempt to resist OD7 by articulating a further condition which\ndistinguishes problematic from unproblematic cases of\noverdetermination. For instance, one might hold that overdetermination\nby o1 and o2 is unproblematic so long as\no1 and o2 aren\u2019t entirely\n independent.[46]\n\nEven supposing, however, that the line between objectionable and\nunobjectionable sorts of overdetermination can be drawn in some\nsatisfactory way, there would still be pressure to accept OD7. We\nshould accept that something other than the atoms shatters the window\nonly if we have good reason to believe in this something. But there is\nno explanatory need to posit baseballs, since there is a\ncomplete causal explanation for all of the relevant events wholly in\nterms of the activities of the atoms. And the debunking arguments in\n \u00a72.6\n purport to show that our ordinary perceptual reasons for believing in\nbaseballs are no good. So we would seem to have no good reason at all\nto accept that there are baseballs, in which case we ought to accept\n OD7.[47]\n\n\nPremise OD4 can be motivated in much the same way as OD7. If baseballs\ndon\u2019t cause anything to happen, then we have no good reason to\nbelieve in them, in which case we should accept OD4. One might also\ngive a more direct defense of OD4 by appealing to the controversial\nEleatic Principle (a.k.a. Alexander\u2019s Dictum), according to\nwhich everything that exists has causal powers. Together with the\nplausible assumption that if baseballs don\u2019t cause anything\nit\u2019s because they can\u2019t cause anything, the\nEleatic Principle entails\n OD4.[48]\n2.8 The Problem of the Many\n\nThe office appears to contain a single wooden desk. The desk is\nconstituted by a single hunk of wood whose surface forms a sharp\nboundary with the environment, without even a single cellulose\nmolecule coming loose from the others. Call this hunk of wood\n\u2018Woodrow\u2019. Now consider the object consisting of all of\nWoodrow\u2019s parts except for a single cellulose molecule,\n\u2018Molly\u2019, making up part of Woodrow\u2019s surface. Call\nthis ever-so-slightly smaller hunk of wood\n\u2018Woodrow-minus\u2019. Because Woodrow-minus is extraordinarily\nsimilar to Woodrow, there is considerable pressure to accept that\nWoodrow-minus is a desk as well. This, in short, is the problem of the\nmany.\n\n(PM1)\nWoodrow is a desk iff Woodrow-minus is a desk.\n(PM2)\nIf so, then it is not the case that there is exactly one desk in\nthe office.\n(PM3)\nThere is exactly one desk in the office.\n\n\nPM1 and PM2 straightforwardly entail that PM3 is false; one of these\nclaims has to\n go.[49]\n\nPM1 is plausible. Woodrow-minus seems to have everything that it takes\nto be a desk: it looks like a desk, it\u2019s shaped like a desk,\nit\u2019s got a flat writing surface, and so forth. Accordingly, it\nseems arbitrary to suppose that Woodrow but not Woodrow-minus is a\ndesk. Moreover, if Molly were removed, Woodrow-minus would certainly\nthen be a desk. But since Woodrow-minus doesn\u2019t itself undergo\nany interesting change when Molly is removed (after all, Molly\nisn\u2019t even part of Woodrow-minus), it stands to reason\nthat Woodrow-minus must likewise be a desk even while Molly is\nattached to it.\n\nOne might deny PM1 on the grounds that being a desk is a\n\u201cmaximal\u201d property, that is, a property of an object that\ncannot be shared by large parts of that object. Since Woodrow is a\ndesk, and since Woodrow-minus is a large part of Woodrow,\nWoodrow-minus is not a\n desk.[50]\n\n\nBut this style of response can be rendered unavailable by introducing\nan element of vagueness into our story. Suppose now that Molly has\nbegun to come loose from the other molecules, in such a way that it is\nnaturally described as being a borderline part of the desk in the\noffice. Let Woodrow-plus be the aggregate of cellulose molecules that\ndefinitely has Molly as a part. PM1 can then be replaced with\nPM1\u2032:\n\n(PM1\u2032)\nWoodrow-plus is a desk iff Woodrow-minus is a desk.\n\n\nWoodrow-plus and Woodrow-minus each seem to have everything that it\ntakes to be a desk, and neither seems to be a better candidate than\nthe other for being a desk. PM2 would then be replaced with\nPM2\u2032:\n\n(PM2\u2032)\nIf Woodrow-plus is a desk iff Woodrow-minus is a desk, then: it is\nnot the case that there is exactly one desk in the\n office.[51]\n\n\nPM1\u2032 can be resisted by proponents of the supervaluationist\nstrategy sketched in\n \u00a72.1\n above. The vague term \u2018desk\u2019 has multiple\nprecisifications, some of which apply to Woodrow-plus, some of which\napply to Woodrow-minus, but none of which applies to both.\nAccordingly, PM1\u2032 is false on some precisifications, and\ntherefore is not true\n simpliciter.[52]\n\n\nConstitutional pluralists can deny both PM2 and PM2\u2032. Regarding\nthe original story, they may insist that neither Woodrow nor\nWoodrow-minus is a desk. Each is a mere hunk of wood, and no mere hunk\nof wood is a desk. Rather, there is exactly one desk, it is\nconstituted by Woodrow, and while Woodrow-minus would constitute that\ndesk if Molly were removed, as things stand it constitutes nothing at\nall. Regarding the revised story, pluralists may again say that there\nis exactly one desk, neither Woodrow-plus nor Woodrow-minus is a desk,\nand it is simply indeterminate whether it is Woodrow-plus or\nWoodrow-minus that constitutes that desk. In that case, PM2\u2032 is\nfalse. It\u2019s true that each is a desk iff the other\nis\u2014since neither is a desk\u2014but it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat there\u2019s more than one or fewer than one\n desk.[53]\n\n\nFinally, one might deny PM3, either by accepting an eliminative view\non which there is no desk in the office or by accepting a permissive\nview on which there is more than one desk in the office. Proponents of\nthe latter response will end up committed to far more than two desks,\nhowever. By parity of reason, there will also be a desk composed of\nall of the cellulose molecules except Nelly (\u2260 Molly). Likewise for\nOllie. And so on. So there will be at least as many desks as there are\ncellulose molecules on the surface of the\n desk.[54]\n\n3. Against Revisionary Ontologies\n3.1 Arguments from Counterexamples\n\nUniversalism seems to conflict with our intuitive judgment that the\nfront halves of trout and the back halves of turkeys do not compose\nanything. Put another way, universalism seems to be open to fairly\nobvious counterexamples. Here is an argument from counterexamples\nagainst universalism:\n\n(CX1)\nIf universalism is true, then there are trout-turkeys.\n(CX2)\n There are no trout-turkeys.\n(CX3)\n So universalism is false.\n\n\nSimilar arguments may be lodged against other revisionary theses. The\nvarious forms of eliminativism wrongly imply that there are no\nstatues; plenitudinism wrongly implies that there are incars; the\ndoctrine of arbitrary undetached parts wrongly implies that there are\nleg complements; and so\n forth.[55]\n\nCompatibilist accounts of the apparent counterexamples take the\ntargeted revisionary views to be entirely compatible with the\nintuitions or beliefs that are meant to motivate CX2. Such accounts\noften take the form of assimilating recalcitrant ordinary utterances\nto some familiar linguistic phenomenon that is known to be potentially\nmisleading. For instance, when an ordinary speaker looks in the fridge\nand says \u2018there\u2019s no beer\u2019, she obviously\ndoesn\u2019t mean to be saying that there is no beer anywhere in the\nuniverse. Rather, she is tacitly restricting her quantifier to things\nthat are in the fridge. Universalists often suggest that something\nsimilar is going on when ordinary speakers say \u2018there are no\ntrout-turkeys\u2019 (or \u2018there\u2019s nothing that has both\nfins and feathers\u2019). Speakers are tacitly restricting their\nquantifiers to ordinary objects, and what they are saying is entirely\ncompatible with there being non-ordinary finned-and-feathered\nthings like trout-turkeys. Universalists may then hold that the\nargument from counterexamples rests on an equivocation. If the\nquantifiers are meant to be restricted to ordinary objects, then CX2\nis true, but CX1 is false: universalism does not entail that any\nordinary things are trout-turkeys. If on the other hand the\nquantifiers are meant to be entirely unrestricted then CX2 is false;\nbut in denying CX2 (so understood), one is not running afoul of\nanything we are inclined to say or believe or\n intuit.[56]\n\n\nThis is just one of many compatibilist strategies that have been\ndeployed in defense of revisionary views. Universalists have also\ninvoked an ambiguity in \u2018object\u2019 to explain the appeal of\n\u2018there is no object that has both fins and feathers\u2019.\nEliminativists have claimed that ordinary utterances of \u2018there\nare statues\u2019 are instances of \u201cloose talk\u201d, or that\nthey are context-sensitive, or that quantifiers are being used in a\nspecial technical sense in the \u201contology\n room\u201d.[57]\n\nOne common complaint about compatibilist accounts is that these\nproposals about what we are saying and what we believe are\nlinguistically or psychologically implausible. For instance, when\nordinary speakers are speaking loosely or restricting their\nquantifiers, they will typically balk when their remarks are taken at\nface value. (\u201cThere\u2019s no beer anywhere in the\nworld?\u201d) But this sort of evidence seems just to be missing in\nthe cases at hand. (\u201cYou think there literally are\nstatues?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing at all with both\nfins and feathers?\u201d) Others have criticized compatibilist\nstrategies by pointing to limitations of their recipes for\nparaphrasing ordinary utterances. For instance, Uzquiano (2004:\n434\u2013435) argues that the standard eliminativist strategy of\nparaphrasing constructions of the form \u2018there are Fs\u2019 in\nterms of there being atoms arranged Fwise cannot be adapted to handle\nconstructions like \u2018some Fs are touching each\n other\u2019.[58]\n\n\nRevisionaries may instead wish to give incompatibilist accounts of the\nputative counterexamples, conceding that the revisionary views they\ndefend are incompatible with ordinary belief (ordinary discourse,\ncommon sense, intuition, etc.), but maintaining that the mistakes can\nbe explained or excused. For instance, revisionaries may contend that\nthe mistaken beliefs are nevertheless justified, so long as one is not\naware of the defeaters that undercut our usual justification (e.g.,\nthose mentioned in\n \u00a72.6).\n Or they may contend that ordinary speakers are not especially\ncommitted to these beliefs, which may in turn suggest that they do not\ndeserve to be treated as data for purposes of philosophical inquiry.\nOr they may call attention to some respect in which the ordinary\nutterances and beliefs are \u201cnearly as good as\n true\u201d.[59]\n\n3.2 Arguments from Charity\n\nOne way of approaching the question of whether there are statues is by\nasking whether the correct interpretation of the English language is\none according to which ordinary utterances of \u2018there are\nstatues\u2019 come out true. The interpretation of populations of\nspeakers is plausibly governed by a principle of charity that\nprohibits the gratuitous ascription of false beliefs and utterances to\npopulations of speakers. Such a principle\u2014which is independently\nmotivated by reflection on how it is that utterances come to have the\nmeanings that they do\u2014can be put to work in arguments for the\nexistence of ordinary objects and for the nonexistence of\nextraordinary objects. Here is one such argument from charity:\n\n(CH1)\nThe most charitable interpretation of English is one on which\nordinary utterances of \u2018there are statues\u2019 comes out\ntrue.\n(CH2)\nIf so, then ordinary utterances of \u2018there are statues\u2019\nare true.\n(CH3)\nIf ordinary utterances of \u2018there are statues\u2019 are\ntrue, then there are statues.\n(CH4)\nSo, there are statues.\n\n\nTo see the idea behind CH1, notice that both eliminativists and\nconservatives can agree that there are atoms arranged statuewise. The\nquestion is whether the English sentence \u2018there are\nstatues\u2019 should be interpreted in such a way that the existence\nof such atoms suffices for it to come out true. Let us call\ninterpretations of \u2018there are statues\u2019 on which the\nexistence of atoms arranged statuewise suffices for its truth\nliberal, and interpretations on which that does not suffice\nfor its truth demanding. The idea then is that, given the\navailability of both liberal and demanding interpretations, the former\nwould clearly be more charitable. CH2 is motivated by the thought that\nthere are no other content-determining factors that favor a demanding\ninterpretation over a liberal interpretation, in which case charity\nwins out and \u2018there are statues\u2019 is true. CH3 looks to be\na straightforward application of a plausible disquotation principle:\nif sentence S says that p, and S is true, then\n p.[60]\n\nOne might challenge CH1 on the grounds that charitable interpretation\nis a holistic matter, and, while the liberal interpretations are\ncharitable in some respects, they are uncharitable in others. After\nall, the puzzles and arguments discussed in\n \u00a72\n seem to show that no interpretation can secure the truth of\neverything that we are inclined to say about ordinary\nobjects. For instance, the liberal interpretations on which MC1 comes\nout true (\u2018Athena and Piece exist\u2019) must, on pain of\ncontradiction, make at least one of MC2 through MC4 come out false.\nBut then some other intuitively true claim\u2014perhaps,\n\u2018Athena and Piece (if they exist) are\nidentical\u2019\u2014will come out false. The demanding\ninterpretations on which MC1 comes out false do better than the\nliberal interpretations on this score, since they can make\nall of MC2 through MC4 come out true. This gain in charity\nmight then be held to counterbalance the loss in charity from\nrendering MC1\n false.[61]\n\n\nOne might also challenge CH1 on the grounds that the principle of\ncharity, properly understood, demands only that the utterances and\nbeliefs of ordinary speakers be reasonable, not that they be true.\nSince it looks to ordinary speakers as if there are statues,\nand since they have no reason to believe that appearances are\nmisleading (having never encountered the arguments for eliminativism),\ntheir utterances and beliefs would be reasonable even if false. The\nprinciple of charity, so understood, would not favor liberal\ninterpretations over demanding\n interpretations.[62]\n\n\nAnother strategy involves resisting the argument at CH2, by\nmaintaining that there are constraints beyond charity that favor the\ndemanding interpretations. Charity, after all, is not the only factor\ninvolved in determining the meanings of our utterances. Certain\npuzzles about content determination have been thought to show that the\ncontent of an expression or utterance cannot be determined solely by\nwhich sentences we are inclined to regard as true; it is also partly a\nmatter of the relative \u201cnaturalness\u201d or\n\u201celigibility\u201d of candidate contents. One who accepts this\nsort of account may maintain that the demanding interpretations,\nalthough less charitable, nevertheless assign more natural contents to\nEnglish sentences than the liberal interpretations, for instance by\nassigning a more natural meaning to the\n quantifiers.[63]\n\n\nFinally, CH3 may be resisted by compatibilists, according to whom what\nordinary speakers are saying is compatible with the\neliminativist\u2019s claim that statues do not exist. Since\nontological discussions (like this one) are not carried out in\nordinary English or ordinary contexts, one cannot infer that there are\nstatues from the fact that ordinary speakers can truly say\n\u2018there are statues\u2019, any more than I can infer that I am\non the moon from the fact that an astronaut truly utters \u2018I am\non the\n moon\u2019.[64]\n3.3 Arguments from Entailment\n\nArguments from entailment purport to establish that eliminativism is\nself-defeating, insofar as certain things that eliminativists affirm\nentail the existence of the very ordinary objects that they wish to\neliminate. Here is a representative argument from entailment: \n\n(ET1)\n There are atoms arranged statuewise.\n(ET2)\n If there are atoms arranged statuewise, then there are\nstatues.\n(ET3)\n So, there are statues.\n\n\nNow consider two arguments for ET2: the argument from identity and the\nargument from application conditions.\n\nThe argument from identity proceeds from the assumption that ordinary\nobjects are identical to the smaller objects of which they are\ncomposed. The statue, for instance, is identical to its atomic parts.\nAccordingly, by affirming that there are atoms arranged statuewise,\neliminativists let into their ontology the very things that they had\nintended to\n exclude.[65]\n\n\nHowever, the view that composites are identical to their parts is\nhighly controversial. One common objection is that the identity\nrelation simply isn\u2019t the sort of relation that can hold between\na single thing and many things. Another common objection is that\nordinary objects have different persistence conditions from their\nparts. For instance, the atoms arranged statuewise, unlike the statue,\nwill still exist if the statue disintegrates and the atoms disperse.\nIt would then seem to follow by Leibniz\u2019s Law that the atoms are\nnot identical to the\n statue.[66]\n\n\nThe argument from application conditions arises out of some general\nconsiderations about how it is that kind terms refer to what they do.\nSuppose an archaeologist uncovers an unfamiliar artifact, gestures\ntowards it, and introduces the name \u2018woodpick\u2019 for things\nof that kind. Yet there are numerous things before her: the woodpick,\nthe woodpick\u2019s handle, the facing surface of the woodpick, etc.\nFurthermore, the woodpick itself belongs to numerous kinds:\nwoodpick, tool, artifact, etc. So how is it\nthat \u2018woodpick\u2019 came to denote woodpicks rather than\nsomething else? (This is an instance of what is known as the\nqua problem.) It must be because the speaker associates\ncertain application conditions and perhaps other descriptive\ninformation with the term \u2018woodpick\u2019, which single out\nwoodpicks\u2014rather than all tools or just the facing surfaces of\nwoodpicks\u2014as the denotation of the term. And the same is\nplausibly so for already-entrenched kind terms like\n\u2018statue\u2019: their reference is largely determined by the\napplication conditions that speakers associate with\n them.[67]\n\n\nArmed with this account of reference determination, one might then\nargue for ET2 as follows. The application conditions that competent\nspeakers associate with \u2018statue\u2019\u2014together with facts\nabout the distribution of atoms\u2014determine whether it applies to\nsomething. But these applications conditions are fairly undemanding:\nnothing further is required for their satisfaction than that there be\natoms arranged statuewise. Accordingly, so long as there are atoms\narranged statuewise, \u2018statue\u2019 does apply to something,\nfrom which it trivially follows that there are\n statues.[68]\n\nThis argument may be resisted on the grounds that the application\nconditions that ordinary speakers associate with \u2018statue\u2019\naren\u2019t quite so undemanding. It\u2019s not enough simply that\nthere be atoms arranged statuewise. Rather, there must be an object\nthat is composed of the atoms\u2014and (eliminativists might go on to\ninsist) there are no such objects. However, those who are moved by the\nqua problem might respond that \u2018object\u2019 itself must be\nassociated with application conditions, which are likewise\nsufficiently undemanding as to be satisfied so long as there are atoms\narranged\n statuewise.[69]\n3.4 Arguments from Coincidence\n\nThe material constitution puzzles from\n \u00a72.3\n can be repurposed as arguments against two forms of permissivism:\nuniversalism and the doctrine of arbitrary undetached parts (DAUP).\nThe basic idea behind both arguments is that permissivists end up\ncommitted to objects that are distinct and yet share all of their\nparts, which is\n impossible.[70]\n\nHere is a coincidence argument against universalism. Let the ks be the\natoms that presently compose my kitchen table, K, and let us suppose\nthat there is some time, t, long before the table itself was made, at\nwhich the ks all existed.\n\n(CU1)\nIf universalism is true, then there is some object, F, that the ks\ncomposed at t.\n(CU2)\nIf the ks composed F at t, then F exists now.\n(CU3)\nIf F exists now, then F = K.\n(CU4)\nIf F = K, then K existed at t.\n(CU5)\nK did not exist at t.\n(CU6)\nSo, universalism is false.\n\n\nCU1 looks to be a consequence of universalism, given our assumption\nthat the ks all existed at t. The idea behind CU2 is that there would\nseem to be only two nonarbitrary accounts of the persistence\nconditions of the widely scattered fusion F: (i) that F exists for as\nlong as the ks are in precisely the arrangement that they enjoy at t\nor (ii) that F exists for as long as the ks exist. Option (i) imposes\nan implausibly severe constraint on the sorts of changes an object can\nsurvive, which leaves us with option (ii)\u2014from which it follows\nthat, since the ks exist now, so does F. The idea behind CU3 is that\nthere cannot be distinct objects which (like F and K) have exactly the\nsame parts and exactly the same location. CU4 is a straightforward\nconsequence of Leibniz\u2019s Law: F by hypothesis existed at t, so\nif F = K then K must also have existed at t. As for CU5, tables\nplausibly are essentially tables, in which case K could not have\nexisted before the table was made.\n\nHere are some options for resisting the argument (some mirroring\nresponses to the puzzles of material constitution). One can deny CU2\non the grounds that table is the \u201cdominant kind\u201d,\nand once K comes into existence, it takes F\u2019s place and F is\nannihilated. Constitutional pluralists can deny CU3 and affirm that F\n\u2260 K, perhaps granting that distinct objects can have exactly the\nsame parts and location, or insisting that F and K have different\n(e.g., temporal) parts. Or one can deny CU5, insisting that K is only\ncontingently a table and (like F) was once a scattered\n fusion.[71]\n\nNow for the coincidence argument against DAUP. Take the example of\nWoodrow and Woodrow-minus from\n \u00a72.8.\n At t1, Molly the cellulose molecule is a part of Woodrow\nand at t2 Molly is removed and destroyed. Let\nWoodrow1 be that (if anything) which \u2018Woodrow\u2019\npicks out at t1; Woodrow2, that (if anything)\nwhich \u2018Woodrow\u2019 picks out at t2; and mutatis\nmutandis for Woodrow-minus1 and Woodrow-minus2.\nHere is the argument:\n\n(CD1)\nIf DAUP is true, then Woodrow-minus1 exists.\n(CD2)\nIf Woodrow-minus1 exists, then\nWoodrow-minus2 exists.\n(CD3)\nIf Woodrow-minus2 exists, then\nWoodrow-minus2 = Woodrow2.\n(CD4)\nIf Woodrow-minus2 = Woodrow2, then\nWoodrow-minus1 = Woodrow1.\n(CD5)\nWoodrow-minus1 \u2260 Woodrow1.\n(CD6)\nSo, DAUP is false.\n\n\nCD1 looks trivial: DAUP guarantees that there is an arbitrary\nundetached part of Woodrow composed of all of its parts other than\nMolly. The idea behind CD2 is that Woodrow-minus doesn\u2019t undergo\nany change between t1 and t2 that could threaten\nits existence; all that happens is that it is separated from something\n(Molly) that was not even a part of it. CD3, like CU3, is motivated by\nthe intuition that objects with the same parts and same location must\nbe identical. CD4 is an application of the transitivity of identity:\nWoodrow-minus1 = Woodrow-minus2, so if\nWoodrow-minus2 = Woodrow2, then (by\ntransitivity) Woodrow-minus1 = Woodrow2; and\nsince Woodrow2 = Woodrow1, it follows (by\ntransitivity) that Woodrow-minus1 = Woodrow1.\nFinally, CD5 is a straightforward consequence of Leibniz\u2019s Law:\nWoodrow-minus1 and Woodrow1 have different parts\nand thus cannot be identical.\n\nAs with the argument against universalism, one can resist this\nargument by denying CD2 and insisting that once Molly is removed,\nWoodrow-minus is \u201cdominated\u201d by Woodrow and ceases to\nexist. Or one can deny CD3 and insist that Woodrow and Woodrow-minus\nare distinct at t2 despite having all the same material\nparts at t2. Or one can deny CD4 by insisting that Woodrow\nhas all of its parts essentially, in which case Woodrow1\n\u2260\n Woodrow2.[72]\n3.5 Arguments from Gunk and Junk\n\nA \u201cgunky\u201d object is a composite object all of whose parts\nthemselves have parts. The mere possibility of gunky objects\nunderwrites an argument against the nihilist thesis that (actually)\nthere are no composite objects.\n\n(GK1)\nIt is possible for there to be gunky objects.\n(GK2)\nIf gunky objects are possible, then nihilism isn\u2019t\nnecessarily true.\n(GK3)\nIf nihilism isn\u2019t necessarily true, then nihilism\nisn\u2019t actually true.\n(GK4)\nSo, nihilism is false.\n\n\nGK1 is plausible. It seems easy enough to imagine gunky objects, for\ninstance by imagining an object with a right and left half, each of\nwhich itself has a right and left half, which themselves have right\nand left halves \u2026 \u201call the way down\u201d, and never\nterminating in simple parts. Moreover, it may even be that\nactually all objects are gunky. GK2 is trivial: if there are\ngunky objects in world w, then there is something with parts in w, in\nwhich case there are composites in w and nihilism is false in w. GK3\nis plausible as well: the actual world contains what would seem to be\nparadigm cases of composites (trees, etc.), so if composition occurs\nanywhere, it surely occurs here. Moreover, nihilism is meant to be an\nanswer to the special composition question, and one would expect such\nan answer to be giving necessary and sufficient conditions for\ncomposition\u2014in which case one would expect proponents of\nnihilism to regard it as a necessary\n truth.[73]\n\nSome will deny GK1. What does seem obviously possible (and easily\nimaginable) for there to be certain kinds of infinite descent. But\ninfinite descent need not be mereological. For instance, it does seem\npossible for there to be objects that can be divided into two halves,\nand whose halves can in turn be divided into two halves, and so on.\nBut it is controversial whether the fact that o can be\ndivided into two halves, h1 and h2, entails that\no is not simple. One might deny that h1 and h2\nexist at all before the division: they are brought into existence when\no is divided and, a fortiori, are not parts of o prior to division. Or\none might concede that, prior to division, h1 and\nh2 exist and are partially colocated with o, but deny that\nthey are thereby parts of\n o.[74]\n\nOne might instead reject GK3 on the grounds that it runs afoul of\n\u201cHume\u2019s Dictum\u201d, according to which there can be no\nnecessary connections among distinct existences. There is some\ncontroversy about how best to understand Hume\u2019s Dictum and, in\nparticular, whether it prohibits necessary connections even between\noverlapping items (which typically are thought not to be\n\u201cdistinct\u201d in the relevant sense). But assuming that it\ndoes, then it will rule out any principle of composition according to\nwhich simples in certain arrangements cannot fail to compose\nsomething\u2014for this would be to impose a necessary connection\nbetween simples being in that arrangement and the existence of a\n(numerically distinct) whole that they compose. And if we cannot in\ngeneral expect theories of composition to be necessary if true, we\nshould not expect nihilism to be necessary if\n true.[75]\n\nJust as the possibility of infinite descent can be wielded against\nnihilism, the possibility of infinite ascent can be wielded against\nuniversalism. Let us say that a world is \u201cjunky\u201d iff every\nobject in that world is a part of some further object.\n\n(JK1)\nJunky worlds are possible.\n(JK2)\nIf junky worlds are possible, then universalism isn\u2019t\nnecessarily true.\n(JK3)\nIf universalism isn\u2019t necessarily true, then universalism\nisn\u2019t actually true.\n(JK4)\nSo, universalism is false.\n\n\nThe idea behind JK1 is supposed to be that, just as there is no\nlogical or conceptual barrier to an infinite descent of parts, there\nis no logical or conceptual barrier to an infinite ascent of wholes.\n(Though not everyone finds themselves able to conceive of junky\nworlds.) The idea behind JK2 runs as follows. According to\nuniversalism, every plurality of objects has a fusion, and, in\nparticular, the plurality consisting of all things has a fusion. But\nthere can be no fusion of all things in a junky world. For that fusion\nwould have to be a part of something (since the world is junky); but\nif it already has everything as a part, there is nothing left for it\nto be a part of. JK3 can be motivated in much the same way as GK3:\nuniversalism is meant to be an answer to the special composition\nquestion, and thus will presumably be necessary if true. The\nstrategies considered above for resisting the gunk argument seem to\napply equally to the junk argument\u2014one can, for instance, deny\nthat we are imagining what we think we are, or one can invoke\nHume\u2019s Dictum and deny that universalism is necessary if\n true.[76]\n4. Fundamental Existents\n\nAs we have seen, there are some who deny that ordinary composite\nobjects exist, and we have examined some of their reasons for\nembracing one or another form of eliminativism. But there are also\nsome who grant that ordinary objects exist but deny that they exist\nfundamentally. This is an importantly different claim, which\ncan be spelled out in either of two importantly different\n ways.[77]\n\nFirst, one might deny that any ordinary composite objects are\nfundamental, that is, one can insist that there is something in which\nthey are grounded. Even those who think that ordinary objects exist\nwill likely find it natural to suppose that no ordinary composites are\nfundamental: all ordinary composites are ultimately going to be\ngrounded in their simple microscopic\n parts.[78]\n\nOn the second understanding of the claim that ordinary objects do not\nexist fundamentally, the idea is that they are not in the domain of a\nfundamental quantifier, where the fundamental quantifiers are the\nquantifiers that appear in the best correct and complete theory of the\nworld. To help see how the two understandings of \u201cexists\nfundamentally\u201d can come apart, notice that the identity relation\nis plausibly fundamental (appearing in the best theory of the world),\ndespite the fact that it relates every object\u2014including\nnonfundamental objects\u2014to itself. A relation can be fundamental\nwithout dragging everything in its extension into the fundamental\nlevel with it. Similarly, even if the ordinary existential quantifier\nis a fundamental quantifier, that does not obviously entail that\neverything in its domain (namely: everything) is fundamental as\n well.[79]\n\nEven so, one might deny that the ordinary existential quantifier is a\nfundamental quantifier on grounds of parsimony. Explanations involving\nquantifiers whose domains include nonfundamental objects (the idea\ngoes) will be less parsimonious than explanations involving\nquantifiers whose domains include only fundamental objects. And since\nthe ordinary existential quantifier includes nonfundamental objects\n(e.g., ordinary composites), it will be less fundamental than\nrestricted quantifiers ranging only over fundamental\n objects.[80]\n\nHow do these stances on fundamentality\u2014that ordinary objects are\nnot fundamental or are not in the domain of fundamental\nquantifiers\u2014compare to the eliminativist theses discussed above?\nAlthough there is a superficial resemblance, the differences are\nmanifest when we consider how the views interact with the arguments\nagainst conservatism in\n \u00a72.\n Eliminativists, who say that ordinary objects do not exist, can\naccept AV5, DK4, OD5, SR4, and ST8 and can reject AR1, MC1, and PM3 in\nthe arguments above, since the latter affirm, and the former deny, the\nexistence of ordinary objects. But those who are willing to deny only\nthat ordinary objects exist fundamentally (in one or the\nother sense) must find some other way of addressing the arguments.",
