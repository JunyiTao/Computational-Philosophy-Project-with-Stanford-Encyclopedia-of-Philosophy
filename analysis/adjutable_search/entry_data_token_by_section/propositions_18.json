    "main_text": "The Nature and Status of Propositions || Easy Arguments: Mind-Independence and Abstractness\n7.1 Easy Arguments: Mind-Independence and Abstractness\n\nReflection on the proposition role leads many propositionalists to\nrather dramatic answers to questions about the nature and status of\npropositions. Below is one standard line of argument, versions of\nwhich can be found in Bealer (1998) and Schiffer (2003). (See also\nCartwright (1962) and Soames (1999).)\n\nThe proposition that there are rocks, which we denote \\(\\ltb\\)there\nare rocks\\(\\gtb\\), does not entail the existence of any beings that\nhave or are capable of having mental states. It entails this neither\nin a strictly or broadly logical sense. That is, it is\npossible in the broadest sense for \\(\\ltb\\)there are\nrocks\\(\\gtb\\) to be true in the absence of all mental states. But now,\nif this proposition is possibly true in the absence of mental states,\nthen it possibly exists in the absence of all mental states, and so is\nmind-independent. This is an easy argument for the mind-independence\nof at least some propositions.\n\nA parallel \u201ceasy argument\u201d can be given for the\nabstractness of at least some propositions. \\(\\ltb 2+2=4\\gtb\\) does\nnot entail the existence of concrete entities. So it is possible for\nit to be true (and so to exist) in the absence of concrete entities.\nThus, it is possibly abstract. Assuming, contra Linksy and Zalta\n(1996), that abstractness is, necessarily, an essential feature of\nabstract entities, then it follows that \\(\\ltb 2+2=4\\gtb\\) is in fact\nabstract. One might want to extend such arguments to contingent\npropositions. Consider \\(\\ltb\\)there are trees\\(\\gtb\\). This\nproposition is false in a world without concrete entities. But if it\nis false in such a world, it must exist in that world, and so is\npossibly, and so actually abstract.\n\nSimilar arguments can be constructed for properties. If properties are\nwhat we assert of objects and what is true/false of\nobjects, then there are simple arguments for the conclusion that at\nmany properties are mind-independent and abstract.\n\nIt is dangerous to generalize these sorts of \u201cEasy\nArguments\u201d to all propositions (particularly singular\npropositions). But even if they cannot be fully generalized, they\nthreaten to show that propositions would be mind-independent abstract\nentities. Now, given that propositions de jure are sharable\nobjects of attitudes, it is antecedently unlikely that they should\nturn out to be, say, token utterances. But one might have thought that\npropositions could be identified with natural language sentence types\n(as in Quine 1960), or with sentence types in the language of thought.\nBut if the Easy Arguments succeed, it seems that to accept\npropositions, we must accept Platonism. Conceptualism about\npropositions seems ruled out.\n\nMany philosophers deny that there are propositions precisely because\nthey accept the validity of these Easy Arguments (and the truth of\ncertain attitude ascriptions). There are familiar problems besetting\nthe believer in abstract entities. The two \u201cBenacerraf\nproblems,\u201d in particular have received much attention in the\nliterature: the epistemological problem and identification problem.\nThe epistemological problem for abstract propositions, roughly, is\nthis: how can we know about abstract propositions, given that we\ncannot causally interact with them? The identification problem\nrequires a bit more explanation. If propositions are abstract, then\nthere will be many distinct candidates for propositions which seem to\nplay the proposition role equally well. If certain entities, the\n\\(F\\)s, are candidates for being propositions, why won\u2019t the\nentities consisting of an \\(F\\) paired with the number 1 count as\nadequate candidates as well, so long as we reconstrue predicates for\npropositions in such a way as to make the number 1 irrelevant? But\npropositions cannot be both \\(F\\)s and these new entities, because\nthese new entities are not \\(F\\)s. Is it simply indeterminate what\npropositions are? See the entry on\n platonism in metaphysics.\n (See also J. Moore 1999.)\n\nThe Easy Arguments can appear suspicious. How can the seemingly\nobvious acknowledgement that there are propositions\u2014i.e., that\nbeliefs have sharable objects which bear truth-values\u2014commit us\nto there being mind-independent abstract entities? We will discuss two\nsorts of reply found in the literature. Both are objections to the\ninference from there being propositions to the claim that\npropositions have the surprising features. We are putting aside\nobjections to the claim that there are propositions.\n",
