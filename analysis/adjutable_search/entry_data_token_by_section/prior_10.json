They\nplanned to sleep out, but with winter fading into spring they soon\ntired of it, and moved into a small apartment in the village of\nRoquebrune, on the south coast. They ended up staying several months.\nArthur liked France, saying \u2018It\u2019s the Reddest country\nwe\u2019ve been in so far\u2019. Clare worked as a baker in a cake\nshop while Arthur translated essays by the French philosopher Georges\nSorel. They swelled their meagre income by gambling at nearby Monte\nCarlo. \u2018[W]e play very cautiously\u2019, Arthur\nsaid\u2014\u2018we\u2019re a few hundred francs up\u2019.\n\n\nA short visit across the border to Hitler\u2019s Germany left Prior\naghast. \u2018We got out of the place as fast as we could\u2019, he\nsaid: \u2018the general mental atmosphere is just one big Hell\u2019.\nAt Roquebrune he met a young German backpacker, a Lutheran, pleasant\nand mild of manner, according to Prior, but pro-Hitler and virulently\nanti-Jewish\u2014the German responded with \u2018a queer look\u2019\nwhen Prior \u2018told him that if I was in Germany I would be a member\nof the Bekenntniskirche\u2019, the anti-Hitler, Barth-inclined German\nConfessional Church. The Priors also visited Austria, not long after\nthe March 1938 Anschluss (union) with Germany. Horrified by\nthe rampant anti-semitism they found there, they wrote an article about\nthe plight of the Austrian Jews for the Otago Daily Times,\nunder Clare\u2019s nom de plume \u2018John Everdean\u2019. They\nreported that posters bearing slogans like \u2018You will never get\nclean milk if you get it from Jews\u2019 were ruining Jewish\nbusinesses, and Jewish shops had a \u2018dirty yellow placard pasted\nacross the door\u2019, warning customers away (Everdean 1938).\n\n\nPrior anticipated his arrival in England with mixed feelings. He had\nexperienced the English at close quarters aboard the Ormonde:\nthey \u2018stink with Race Prejudice\u2019, he wrote. His experiences\non the boat had he said taught him that he liked \u2018Americans\nbetter than Englishmen\u2019\u2014and \u2018Australians better than\nNew Zealanders\u2019. It was in the early summer of 1938 that the\ncouple crossed the English Channel and settled in London. Whether the\nreality was better or worse than Prior\u2019s expectations is hard to\nsay. He certainly found \u2018abominable race-prejudice\u2019, and\npolitically there was also \u2018plenty to disgust us\u2019\u2014as\nwell as \u2018the extraordinary backwardness of England as compared\nwith N.Z.\u2019.\n\n\n\u2018England\u2019s a country that fills one with a kind of\nimpotent and maddening despair\u2019, he said. But he also emphasized\nthat \u2018London is the place to meet worth-while\npeople\u2019, saying not very long after he arrived, \u2018We have so\nfar been much more \u201csuccessful\u201d in London than we ever\nexpected\u2019. There was also a disappointment awaiting him: the SCM\nPress had declined a book manuscript on theologian Karl Barth he had\nsent to them just before leaving New Zealand. Next he tried T. & T.\nClark, but the book never did see the light of day.\n\n\nPrior was soon contributing reviews to a handful of magazines,\nincluding The Student Movement and the left-wing feminist\nweekly Time and Tide. The snag was that his work was usually\nunpaid\u2014but he was allowed to keep the books he reviewed and he\nsold them at half-price. Things looked up when T. S. Eliot gave him a\n\u2018decent payment\u2019 for two reviews in the literary magazine\nThe Criterion. (Prior found Eliot \u2018decidedly on the old\nside\u2019 and \u2018very shy & quiet\u2019.) But money was\nalways tight. Eventually Clare started taking in typing and Arthur\nfound temporary clerical work in the Examinations Department of London\nUniversity (Prior 1941).\n",
