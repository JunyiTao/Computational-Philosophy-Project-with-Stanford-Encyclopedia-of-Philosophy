    "main_text": "Arguments for Compositionality || Methodology\n3.3 Methodology\n\nBy far the most popular reason for believing in compositionality is\nthat it works. Linguists have adopted various versions of the\nprinciple as a working hypothesis and developed semantic theories on\ntheir basis. These theories have provided intuitively satisfactory\nexplanations for certain data, such as the validity or invalidity of\ninferences or contrasts in acceptability between minimal pairs.\nMoreover, whenever it was suggested that certain phenomena require\nabandonment of the principle, it was subsequently shown that this is\nnot so: reasonably elegant and comparatively natural compositional\ntheories were just around the corner; cf.\n section 4.2.\n \n\nDespite its popularity, this is not a very good reason to believe in\ncompositionality. The fact that compositional semantic theories can\nexplain certain things does not show that they explain those things\nbecause they are compositional. Do we have reason to think\nthat without assuming compositionality we would not be able to explain\nthe same things? It seems to me that we have no such reason:\nsemanticists have focused on whether they can hold on to\ncompositionality while providing satisfactory explanations, not on\nwhether they have to embrace compositionality in order to\nprovide satisfactory explanations. We are not entitled to assume that\nadopting compositionality as a working hypothesis has in any way\ncontributed to explanatory success in semantics. \n\nA much more promising methodological argument for compositionality\ngoes as follows. The fact that we are able to communicate in real time\nmakes it overwhelmingly likely that the computational complexity of\nthe interpretation algorithm we employ is relatively low. In fact, it\nseems reasonable to think that semantic theories with minimal\ncomplexity are, other things being equal, preferable. And there are\ncertain results that show that, under certain conditions, semantics\ntheories that conform to a certain strengthening of\n (C)\n will be minimally complex; cf. Pagin (2012). Alas, the conditions in\nquestion tend to be unrealistic for natural languages. Nonetheless, we\ncan think of them as idealizations, which makes adoption of\ncompositionality as a working hypothesis still a reasonable one. \n",
