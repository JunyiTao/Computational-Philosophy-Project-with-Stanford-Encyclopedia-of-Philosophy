    "main_text": "Cognate Phenomena || Condonation\n2.3 Condonation\n\nThere are many ways to respond to wrongdoers who are blameworthy for\ntheir conduct. One such way is to condone their conduct\n(Hughes 1995). \u201cBroadly speaking, to condone\u201d, writes\nCharles Griswold, \u201cis to collaborate in the lack of censure of\nan action, and perhaps to enable further wrong-doing by the\noffender\u201d (2007: 46). What is it to collaborate in the lack of\ncensure of an action? Griswold makes two suggestions: \n\n\nOne may condone in the sense of accepting while not disapproving (by\nnot holding the wrong-doing against its author), or in the sense of\ntolerating while disapproving (a sort of \u201clook the other\nway\u201d or \u201cputting up with\u201d strategy). (2007:\n46\u20137) \n\n\nWe can call the first kind of condoning\u2014the one that involves\naccepting and not disapproving of\nconduct\u2014A-condonation. We can call the second kind of\ncondonation\u2014the kind that involves disapproving of but\ntolerating conduct\u2014D-condonation. A brief discussion can\nhelp us to see how each differs from forgiveness.\n\nAccording to Garrard and McNaughton, when \n\n\nwe condone an action, we say in effect that it wasn\u2019t really\nsuch a bad thing to do [\u2026] Condoning an action amounts to\nsaying (correctly or incorrectly) that the action wasn\u2019t really\nwrong. (2010: 85) \n\n\nJean Hampton also seems to have something like A-condonation in\nmind:\n\n\nI will define \u2018condonation\u2019 as the acceptance, without\nmoral protest (either inward or outward), of an action which ought to\nwarrant such protest, made possible, first, by ridding oneself of the\njudgement that the action is wrong, so that its performer cannot be a\nwrongdoer, and, second, by ridding oneself of any of attendant\nfeelings (such as those which are involved in resentment) which\nsignify one\u2019s protest of the action. (Murphy & Hampton 1988:\n40)\n\n\nIn order to forgive, however, the victim must represent the putative\nrecipient of forgiveness as one who did something morally wrong (or\nbad or vicious).\n\nD-condonation occurs when an agent disapproves of someone\u2019s\nconduct, but tolerates it. Griswold characterizes it as a sort of\n\u201clook the other way\u201d or \u201cputting up with\u201d\nstrategy (2007). The forgiver, by contrast, does not paper over\nwrongdoing\u2014she is prepared to blame, but forgoes it.\n\nTwo other considerations help distinguish condoning from forgiving.\nFirst, under typical circumstances, we can condone actions that are\nnot wrongs against us (Haber 1991: 59\u201360). We cannot, however,\nat least in typical circumstances, forgive others for their wrongs\nagainst others. Second, while we forgive agents for their\nconduct (or perhaps their characters), when we condone, we condone\nthe conduct (or the character). It is infelicitous to say,\n\u201cI condone you for lying to me\u201d whereas it makes perfect\nsense to say, \u201cI forgive you for lying to me\u201d.\n",
