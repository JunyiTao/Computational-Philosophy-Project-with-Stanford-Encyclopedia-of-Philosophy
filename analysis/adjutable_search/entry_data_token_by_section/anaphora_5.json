    "main_text": "Recent Theories of Problematic Anaphora || Descriptive Approaches\n3.3 Descriptive Approaches\n\nThere have been many accounts of the semantics of anaphora according\nto which anaphoric pronouns in some sense function like definite\ndescriptions. Though there are important differences between such\ntheories, examples of theories of this sort include Evans (1977),\nParsons (1978, Other Internet Resources), Davies (1981), Neale (1990),\nHeim (1990) and Elbourne (2005). Theories of this sort are often\ncalled E-Type or\nD-type approaches. Though it is beyond the scope of this\narticle to compare all the different accounts, some of the main\ndifferences in types of accounts are as follows. E-type accounts are\nsometimes distinguished as ones in which a definite description fixes\nthe referent of an anaphoric pronoun, whereas D-type accounts are\nones in which the pronoun itself has the semantics of a definite\ndescription. However, it is common to describe the latter as 'E-type' as well. These are further sub-divided into those that treat\npronouns as definite descriptions merely at the level of semantics and\nthose that also treat them as descriptions at the level of syntax.\nFinally, accounts differ in how the descriptive material is recovered.\nSome accounts hold that the descriptive material has to be recovered\nlinguistically, from prior discourse. Others hold that it can be any\ncontextually salient description.\n\nWe will discuss two of the best known versions of the view, Neale\n(1990) and Elbourne (2005). We should add that though Neale developed\nthe view in question in greater detail, Davies (1981) had earlier\ndefended essentially the same view in all crucial\n respects.[23]\n Thus, the view we go on to describe should probably be called the\nDavies-Neale view. But since we shall focus on Neale\u2019s\npresentation of the view, we shall talk of Neale\u2019s view.\n\nOn Neale\u2019s view, in all instances of problematic anaphora,\nanaphoric pronouns \u201cgo proxy for\u201d definite descriptions\nunderstood as quantifiers along roughly Russellian lines. First,\nconsider discourse anaphora. Neale\u2019s view is that in a discourse\nsuch as:\n\n(37)\n John\nbought a donkey. Harry vaccinated it.\n\n\nthe pronoun \u201cit\u201d \u201cgoes proxy for\u201d the definite\ndescription \u201cthe donkey John bought.\u201d Hence the second\nsentence of such a discourse is equivalent to the sentence\n\u201cHarry vaccinated the donkey John bought\u201d with the\ndescription understood in the standard Russellian fashion. Within a\ngeneralized quantifier type framework, where \u201cthe\u201d is\ntreated as a determiner that, like other determiners, combines with a\nset term to form a quantified NP, the evaluation clause for sentences\ncontaining a singular description (with wide scope) can be given as\nfollows\n\n(38)\n\n\u201c[The \\(x:Fx](Gx)\\)\u201d is true iff \\(|\\mathbf{F}|=1\\) and\n\\(|\\mathbf{F-G}|=0\\)\n\n\nSo the second sentence of (37) is true iff Harry vaccinated the unique\ndonkey John bought. Thus far, then, the view is that pronouns\nanaphoric on singular indefinites are interpreted as Russellian\ndefinite descriptions.\n\nThere is, however, a further complication in Neale\u2019s theory that\nis invoked in the explanation of donkey anaphora. In particular, Neale\nintroduces what he calls a \u201cnumberless description\u201d: a\ndescription that, unlike semantically singular descriptions, puts no\ncardinality constraint on the denotation of the set term that combines\nwith the determiner to form the quantified NP (other than that it must\nbe nonempty\u2014note above how in the singular case \\(|\\mathbf{F}|\\)\nis constrained to equal one.) Following Neale, let \u201cwhe\u201d\nbe the determiner (corresponding to \u201cthe\u201d) used to form\n\u201cnumberless descriptions.\u201d Then the evaluation clause for\nsentences containing numberless descriptions, analogous to (38) above,\nwould be\n\n(39)\n\n\u201c[whe \\(x: Fx](Gx)\\)\u201d is true iff \\(|\\mathbf{F}| \\ge 1\\)\nand \\(|\\mathbf{F-G}|=0\\)\n\n\nThus numberless descriptions are in effect universal quantifiers.\n\nIn addition to going proxy for Russellian singular descriptions in the\nway we have seen, Neale claims that anaphoric pronouns sometimes go\nproxy for numberless descriptions. In particular, Neale holds that\npronouns anaphoric on singular existential quantifiers (but outside of\ntheir scope) can be interpreted either as standard Russellian\ndescriptions or as numberless descriptions. Now if the\npronouns in our conditional and relative clause donkey sentences\n(repeated here)\n\n(25)\n\nIf Sarah owns a donkey, she beats it.\n(26)\nEvery woman who owns a donkey beats it.\n\n\nare interpreted as a numberless description, (25) asserts that if\nSarah owns a donkey, she beats all the donkeys she owns and (26)\nasserts that every donkey owning woman beats every donkey she owns.\nThus, Neale\u2019s account of donkey anaphora requires the pronouns\nhere to be interpreted as numberless descriptions.\n\nHaving seen how Neale\u2019s theory handles discourse anaphora and\ndonkey anaphora, we turn to difficulties with the account. An obvious\nquestion concerning an account like this that allows pronouns\nanaphoric on singular existential quantifiers to go proxy for both\nRussellian and numberless descriptions is: what determines\nwhether such a pronoun is going proxy for a Russellian, as opposed to\na numberless, description? This question is pressing for Neale\u2019s\naccount, since there will be a substantial difference in the truth\nconditions of a pronoun-containing sentence depending on whether the\npronoun receives a numberless or Russellian interpretation. In his\nmost explicit statement about the matter (1990: 237) Neale makes clear\nthat it is primarily whether the utterer had a particular individual\nin mind in uttering the indefinite description that determines whether\na pronoun anaphoric on it receives a Russellian or a numberless\n interpretation.[24]\n\nIf this is correct, then discourses of the form\n\n(40)\n A(n)\nF is G. He/she/it is H.\n\n\ngenerally ought to display both readings (in the suitable contexts),\ndepending on whether the utterer of the discourse had a particular\nindividual in mind in uttering \u201cA(n) F\u201d. So the\nsecond sentences of discourses of the form of (40) ought to have\nreadings on which they mean the unique F that is G is\nH (Russellian) and on which they mean every F\nthat is G is H (numberless). But this does not seem to\nbe the case. In particular, such discourses do not have readings\ncorresponding to the numberless interpretation of the pronoun.\nConsider the discourse anaphora analogue of the donkey conditional\n(25):\n\n(25a)\n Sarah\nowns a donkey. She beats it.\n\n\nIt seems clear that this discourse has no reading on which the second\nsentence means that Sarah beats every donkey she owns, even if we\nimagine that the utterer of the discourse had no particular donkey in\nmind when she uttered the first sentence. Suppose, for example, that\nthe Homeland Security and Donkey Care Bureau comes to town and wants\ninformation about local donkey ownership and beating. The speaker\ntells them that she really don\u2019t know how many donkeys anybody\nowns, and has never seen or had any other contact with particular\nlocal donkeys. But she tells them that she has received some\ninformation from reliable sources and it has been deemed\n\u201ccredible\u201d. Asked what she has heard, she responds:\n\u201cSarah owns a donkey and she beats it\u201d.\n\nEven though she has no particular donkey in mind in uttering these\nsentences, we simply don\u2019t get a numberless reading here. If\nSarah beats some donkey she owns, the speaker has spoken truly even if\nshe owns others she fails to beat. Or again, suppose we are debating\nwhether anybody has an eight track tape player anymore, and one of us\nsays \u201cI\u2019ll bet the following is true: some guy with a\n\u201868 Camaro owns an eight track player and he still uses\nit.\u201d Again, there is no numberless reading for the pronoun in\nthe second sentence, even though the speaker clearly has no particular\neight-track player in mind. If some \u201868 Camaro driving guy owns\nand uses an eight-track player, the sentence is true even if he owns\nother eight track players that aren\u2019t\n used.[25]\n\nSo it appears that Neale\u2019s account has no explanation of why the\npronouns in discourses like (25a) never have numberless readings.\nNeale\u2019s account has similar problems with sentences like:\n\n(41)\n Some\nwoman who owns a donkey beats it.\n\n\nHere again, Neale\u2019s theory predicts that this sentence has a\nreading on which its truth requires that some woman beats every donkey\nshe owns. And again, even if we imagine the sentence being uttered\nwithout any particular woman or donkey in mind, we don\u2019t get\nthis reading of the sentence predicted by Neale\u2019s theory, (say\nwe are discussing women\u2019s tendencies towards animals they own,\nand one of us utters (41) simply thinking it is statistically likely\nto be true). So Neale\u2019s account has no explanation as to why the\nsecond sentence of discourse (25a) and sentence (41) lack the relevant\nreadings assigned to those sentences by his theory.[26]\n\nElbourne (2005) proposes a different D-type theory. The main thesis of\nthe book is that pronouns of all types, proper names, and definite\ndescriptions have a unified syntax and semantics: they are all of type\n\\(\\langle s, e\\rangle\\) (functions from situations to individuals) and\nare syntactically comprised of a definite determiner that takes two\narguments: an index and an NP (noun phrase). \n\nHis theory of unbound pronouns is NP-deletion theory.\nNP-deletion is when an NP at the level of syntax is (felicitously)\nunpronounced at the surface level as in:\n\n(42)\n I like\nBill\u2019s wine, but Max\u2019s is even better.\n\n\nOn Elbourne\u2019s theory, pronouns undergo obligatory\nNP-deletion. That is, a sentence like\n (25),\n at the level of syntax is actually (25b):\n\n(25)\n If Sarah owns a\ndonkey, she beats it.\n(25b)\n If Sarah owns a donkey, she beats [it donkey].\n\n\nFollowing Elbourne, we\u2019ll suppress mention of the index, since\nit doesn\u2019t do any work here (anaphoric pronouns have a null\nindex on his view, though he does provide arguments for why this null\nindex is present\u2014see Elbourne (2005: 118\u2013126)). Pronouns\nhave the same semantics as the determiner \u201cthe\u201d\n(abstracting away from the phi-features of pronouns) so that (25b) has\nthe same semantics as (25c):\n\n(25c)\n If\nSarah owns a donkey, she beats the donkey.\n\n\nThis is motivated by the insight that pronouns pattern with\nminimal definite descriptions rather than long ones, as other\nD-type theories have it. For example, a theory like Neale\u2019s\npredicts that (43a) has the semantics of (43b):\n\n(43a)\n A man\nmurdered Smith, but John does not believe that he murdered\nSmith.\n(43b)\n A man murdered Smith, but John does not believe that the man who\nmurdered Smith murdered Smith.\n\n\nBut this is problematic, because (43a) clearly has a salient, true\nreading, whereas (43b) does not. However, Elbourne observes that (43c)\nhas the same salient true reading as (43a):\n\n(43c) A man\nmurdered Smith, but John does not believe that the man murdered\nSmith.\n\n\nTreating pronouns as determiners is motivated more generally by Postal\n(1966)\u2019s arguments\nthat they at least sometimes have the same semantics as determiners\nbased on examples such as:\n\n(44)\n You\ntroops will embark but the other troops will remain.\n\n\nFinally, positing an NP-deletion theory provides an elegant solution\nto the problem of the formal link, which is that any good account of\nanaphora has to explain why (45a) is felicitous but (46b) is not:\n\n(45a)\n Every\nman who has a wife is sitting next to her.\n(46b)\n #Every\nmarried man is sitting next to her. (Heim 1982, 1990)\n\n\nSince NP-deletion generally requires a linguistic antecedent, if\npronouns are determiners that have undergone NP-deletion, this\nexplains the contrast. \n\nAs mentioned above, pronouns have the semantics of determiners.\nSpecifically, Elbourne proposes a situation semantics\n (situations in natural language semantics),\n where the semantics of pronouns (and determiners) are treated in a\nFregean way, as follows: \n\n\\[\n[[\\mbox{it}]]^g = \\lambda_{\\langle\\langle s,e\\rangle\\langle s,t\\rangle\\rangle}. \\lambda s: \\exists!x(\\lambda s'. x)(s) \n= 1. \\iota x\\ f(\\lambda s'. x)(s)\n= 1\n\\]\n\n\nThat is to say, pronouns come with presuppositions that there is a\nunique individual in each situation that satisfies the predicate, and\n(when that presupposition is satisfied), they refer to that individual\n(in that situation). Conditional donkey anaphora works as follows. A\nsentence like (47) has the structure at LF of (48):\n\n(47)\n If a man\nowns a donkey, he beats it.\n(48)\n [[always\n[if [[a man] [\\(\\lambda\\)6 [[a donkey][ \\(\\lambda\\)2 [t6 owns\nt2]]]]]]][[he man] beats [it donkey]]] (Elbourne 2005:\n 52)[27]\n\n\nThe semantics of \u201calways\u201d is crucial to getting the truth\nconditions right:\n\n\n\\([[\\mbox{always}]]^g = \\lambda p_{\\langle s,t\\rangle}. \\lambda\nq_{\\langle s,t\\rangle}. \\lambda s\\). for every minimal situation\n\\(s'\\) such that \\(s' \\le s\\) and \\(p(s') = 1\\), there is a situation\n\\(s''\\) such that \\(s'' \\le s\\) and \\(s''\\) is a minimal situation\nsuch that \\(s' \\le s''\\) and \\(q(s'') = 1\\) \n\n\nBasically, \u201calways\u201d takes two sentences, and returns true\niff every minimal situation that satisfies the first sentence has a\nminimal extension that satisfies the second sentence. A minimal\nsituation is one that contains one or more thin\nparticulars\u2014an individual abstracted away from its\nproperties\u2014and one or more properties or relations that the thin\nparticular(s) instantiate(s). An extension of a minimal situation\nincludes all those same particulars and properties and relations, with\n(possibly) some more particulars, properties, or relations in\naddition. On Elbourne\u2019s account \u201cif\u201d doesn\u2019t\nplay any role in contributing to the truth conditions of a donkey\nconditional; it is semantically vacuous. It is the (sometimes silent)\nadverb of quantification along with the semantics of the antecedent\nand consequent that do the work in yielding the truth conditions. The\nfollowing are the truth conditions for (47) on Elbourne\u2019s\naccount. (We won\u2019t go through the derivation for relative clause\ndonkey anaphora, but it works similarly. See Elbourne 2005: 53.)\n\n\n\\(\\lambda s_1\\).  For every minimal situation \\(s_4\\) such that\n\n\\(s_4 \\le s_1\\) and there is\nan individual y and a situation \\(s_7\\) such that \\(s_7\\) is a\nminimal situation such that \\(s_7\\le s_4\\) and y is a man in\n\\(s_7\\), such that there is a situation \\(s_9\\) such that \\(s_9\\le\ns_4\\) and \\(s_9\\) is a minimal situation such that\n\n \\(s_7\\le s_9\\) and\nthere is an individual x and a situation \\(s_2\\) such that\n\\(s_2\\) is a minimal situation such that \\(s_2\\le s_9\\) and x\nis a donkey in \\(s_2\\), such that there is a situation \\(s_3\\) such\nthat \\(s_3\\le s_9\\) and \\(s_3\\) is a minimal situation such that \\(s_2\n\\le s_3\\) and y owns x in \\(s_3\\),\n\n there is a situation \\(s_5\\) such that\n\n \\(s_5\\le s_1\\) and \\(s_5\\) is a minimal situation\nsuch that \\(s_4\\le s_5\\) and \\(\\iota x\\ x\\) is a man in \\(s_5\\) beats\n in \\(s_5\\) \\(\\iota x\\ x\\) is a donkey in \\(s_5\\). (2005: 52)\n \n\n\n\nThus on Elbourne\u2019s account (47) is true iff each donkey-owning\nman beats every donkey he owns.\n\nElbourne surprisingly never goes through a derivation of a case of\ncross-sentential anaphora as in:\n\n(49)\n A woman\nwalked in. She sat down.\n\n\nHis view is that this has the same semantics as (49a):\n\n(49a)\n A\nwoman walked in. The woman sat down.\n\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t provide an account of how this works, neither in\ndescription nor detailed derivation. One worry about this is that in\nthe conditional and relative clause donkey sentences, the fact that\nthe pronoun(s) co-varies with its antecedent is accounted for by\n\u201calways\u201d and \u201cevery\u201d. These expressions\nquantify over situations in a way that guarantees that the man who\nbeats the donkey is the same man who owns that same donkey,\neffectively acting as (semantic) binding. But there is no such\nmechanism in place to guarantee that \u201cthe woman\u201d in (the\nsituation in) the second sentence of (49) in any sense co-varies with\nthe woman (in the situation) in the first. It is not clear how\nElbourne\u2019s view can accomplish this without employing either a\ndynamic notion of binding or a more traditional d-type account with\ncomplete descriptions.\n\nHowever, Elbourne\u2019s account doesn\u2019t encounter the same\nproblem as Neale\u2019s in predicting numberless readings where there\nare none, as he doesn\u2019t posit a numberless interpretation of the\npronoun at all. This highlights a difference between the way that\nNeale\u2019s theory approaches the truth conditions of conditional\ndonkey sentences and the way DRT, dynamic semantics, the CDQ theory\n(discussed in the next section) and other D-type theories like\nElbourne\u2019s and Heim (1990)\u2019s do (Heim 1990 also employs a\nsituation semantics to account for conditional donkey anaphora). In\nthese other theories, the requirement that all the donkey-owning men\nbeat all the donkeys they own for (47) to be true arises due to the\ninteraction of the semantic of indefinites, the semantics of anaphoric\npronouns and the semantics of\n conditionals.[28]\n Indeed, it is the latter that is primarily implicated in (47)\u2019s\ntruth requiring that all donkeys owned by donkey-owning men\nbe beaten (since the theories posit some sort of universal\nquantification in the semantics of conditionals). By contrast, on\nNeale\u2019s view, the requirement that the men beat all the donkeys\nthey own for (47) to be true (on one of its readings) essentially\nfalls out of the semantics of the anaphoric pronoun alone, since on\none of its readings, it expresses universal quantification over\ndonkeys Sarah owns (the numberless description reading).\n\nOne problem that D-type theories face is that pronouns come with a uniqueness requirement (either as a presupposition or part of the asserted content). But it has been observed that pronouns anaphoric on indefinites do not have a uniqueness requirement; it seems that the truth conditions for such sentences are existential. This observation is nicely captures by Discourse Representation Theory, File Change Semantics, dynamic semantics, and the Context Dependent Quantifier approach (discussed in the next section).  For example, consider (49) again.  This seems true even if many women walked into the contextually salient place at the contextually salient time, and regardless of whether they sat down or not, so long as at least one woman walked in and sat down. Mandelkern & Rothschild (2020) call this phenomenon \"definiteness filtering\" and Lewis (forthcoming) calls it \"the problem of non-uniqueness\".  Both of the cited works argue that there is evidence of uniqueness requirements on definites more generally, and the non-uniqueness is specific to the kind of constructions in (49). Mandelkern & Rothschild tentatively propose a D-type theory that employs situation semantics, while Lewis (forthcoming) argues for a D-type theory that takes definite descriptions to be ambiguous between presupposing worldly uniqueness and discourse uniqueness.[29]\n\n\nAnother problem that all D-type theories must address is the problem of\nindistinguishable participants. Since on D-type theories,\npronouns in one way or another have the semantics of definite\ndescriptions, they come with uniqueness presuppositions. When it comes\nto conditional donkey anaphora, the way to meet these uniqueness\npresuppositions is by employing minimal situations\u2014the definite\ndescription then picks out the unique object satisfying the\ndescription in the minimal situation. (With the exception of\nNeale\u2019s theory: since he employs numberless pronouns, the\npronouns have no uniqueness presupposition.) Thus uniqueness is\nsatisfied within the situation, even if it can\u2019t be satisfied in\nthe larger world. But in examples of indistinguishable participants,\nuniqueness cannot even be satisfied within a minimal situation.\nConsider the typical example, (50):\n\n(50)\n If a\nbishop meets a bishop, he blesses him.\n\n\nIn the minimal situation that satisfies the antecedent, there are\ntwo bishops that have the same property (meeting another\nbishop). Thus descriptions like \u201cthe bishop\u201d or\n\u201cthe bishop who meets a bishop\u201d do not denote uniquely.\nDRT and dynamic theories don\u2019t have any problem at all with\nthese examples because pronouns are treated as dynamically bound\nvariables, not definite descriptions, and each instance of \u201ca\nbishop\u201d in the antecedent of (50) is associated with a different\nvariable, which prescribe the anaphoric links to the two pronouns in\nthe consequent. For D-type solutions to this puzzle see Heim(1990),\nLudlow (1994), Elbourne (2005, 2016), Lewis (forthcoming).\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that there are some who propose\nmixed approaches, wherein some pronouns are treated as\ndynamically bound variables whereas others are treated as D-type (see\nChierchia 1995; Kurafuji 1998, 1999). On these views, some pronouns\nare ambiguous between the two readings, while others have only the\ndynamically bound variable or D-type reading. This type of theory\navoids many of the problems raised for each type of account, since\nthey use dynamic semantics for the examples most amenable to a dynamic\nexplanation and d-type pronouns for example most amenable to that sort\nof explanation. However, the theory comes at a considerable\ntheoretical cost in that it predicts a systematic ambiguity in\npronouns that is (arguably) not explicitly marked in any language.\n(See Elbourne 2005 for further criticisms of these views.)\n",
