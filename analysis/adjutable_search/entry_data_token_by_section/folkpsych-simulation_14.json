    "main_text": "The Role of Mental Simulation in Mindreading || Summary\n4.5 Summary\n\nIn sections 2, 3, and 4 we dwelt upon the \u201cinternal\u201d\ndisagreements among Simulation Theorists. It goes without saying that\nsuch disagreements are both wide and deep. In fact, different\nSimulation Theorists give different answers to such fundamental\nquestions as: \u201cWhat is mental simulation?\u201d, \u201cHow\ndoes mental simulation contribute to mindreading?, \u2018What is the\nrole of introspection in mindreading?\u201d In light of such\ndifferences of opinion in the simulationist camp, one might conclude\nthat, after all, Stich and Nichols (1997) were right when saying that\nthere is no such thing as the Simulation Theory. However, if\none considers what is shared among Simulation Theorists, one will\nrealize that there is unity amidst this diversity. A good way to\nreveal the commonalities among different versions of ST is by\ncontrasting ST with its arch-enemy, i.e., the Theory-Theory of\nmindreading. This is what we do in the next section.\n",
