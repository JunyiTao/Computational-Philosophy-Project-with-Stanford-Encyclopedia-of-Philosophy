    "main_text": "Answering the Evaluation Question || Other Suggestions\n3.5 Other Suggestions\n\nAlthough harm, autonomy, and treating persons as things are the most\nprominent suggestions about what makes manipulation wrong when it is\nwrong, one can find other suggestions in the literature. For example,\nMarcia Baron\u2019s virtue-theoretic account of manipulativeness\nsuggests that we might account for what is wrong about manipulation in\nterms of the character of the manipulator (Baron 2003). Patricia\nGreenspan suggests that when manipulation is immoral, it is because it\nviolates the terms of the relationship between the manipulator and his\ntarget\u2014terms that will vary according to the nature of the\nrelationship between them (Greenspan 2003). Such a view\nsuggests\u2014plausibly\u2014that the moral status of a given\ninstance of manipulation will depend at least in part on the nature of\nthe relationship between the influencer and the target of the\ninfluence.\n",
