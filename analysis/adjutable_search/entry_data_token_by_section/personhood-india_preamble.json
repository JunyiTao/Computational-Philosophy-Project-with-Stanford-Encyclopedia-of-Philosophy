    "main_text": "\n\nSelves and persons are often used as synonyms in contemporary\nphilosophy, and sometimes also in the history of Western philosophy.\nThis is almost never the case in classical Indian philosophical\ntraditions. The Sanskrit term \u2018\u0101tman\u2019\nproperly translated as self stands for whatever it is that is the\nessence of individual humans (manu\u1e63ya) or the\npsychophysical complex (pudgala) which includes the mind,\nbody and sense organs. There is disagreement among the philosophical\nschools about whether the essence is a substantial soul or pure\nconsciousness and whether there is such an essence at all. The\nBuddhist no-self theorists and the C\u0101rv\u0101ka materialists deny\nthat there is any such essence, the psychophysical complex is all\nthere is. Finding an equivalent term across the classical Indian\nphilosophical schools that properly can be translated as person is a\nbit more challenging. The concept of \u2018pudgala\u2019\nused to signify the psychophysical complex as whole in Buddhist\nphilosophy is properly translated as person. But\n\u2018pudgala\u2019 is not used with this strict meaning\nacross the philosophical spectrum. The Jaina philosophers use it as an\nequivalent for matter or material object. There are several terms in\nSanskrit, for example, \u2018j\u012bva-\u0101tma\u2019,\n\u2018puru\u1e63a\u2019,\n\u2018manu\u1e63ya\u2019 which are often used to indicate\npersons, but these terms have wider meanings and do not apply strictly\nto persons. The lack of an exact equivalent in Sanskrit does not,\nhowever, mean that the concept of personhood was not central to\nclassical Indian philosophies other than Buddhism.\n\nA primary concern that motivated most philosophers in ancient India\nwas to find the best way forward in an individual person\u2019s quest\nfor liberation from suffering. All living beings are trapped in the\ncycle of birth and rebirth (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra) which\naccording to most classical Indian philosophers, is characterised by\nsuffering. The highest goal of life is liberation\n(mok\u1e63a or nirv\u0101\u1e47a). Except the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka materialists who believed that death is the end and\nthere is nothing like rebirth or liberation, all other philosophical\nschools believed in the possibility of liberation in this life or in\nfuture lifetimes. The ultimate aim of the classical Indian philosophy\nteachings is thus to help individual persons attain liberation or at\nleast a better life in this life and future lifetimes. Most classical\nIndian philosophers agreed that our ignorance about \u201cwho we\nreally are\u201d is the source and the means to bringing an end to\nsuffering. Thus, metaphysical debates about the nature of individual\npersons and the universe and our place in it are central to the\nclassical Indian philosophical traditions. These debates, however,\ntended to focus on the essence of persons, the self\n(\u0101tman) or the soul substance.\n\nThis is in contrast with contemporary Western philosophy where\nquestions about personal identity and its normative significance are\nat the forefront at least since Parfit (1984). In Section 2, we turn\nbriefly to the contemporary debates about personal identity and\nreflect on how they might benefit from paying attention to the\ndiscussions of personhood in classical Indian philosophy. But before\nwe attempt that, in Sections 1 and 2, we describe the different\nconceptions of personhood in classical Indian philosophy. As I said,\nthere is not much explicit discussion of personhood, so most of the\ntime I draw out the conceptions of persons from other discussions that\nimplicitly refers to persons.\n",
