    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in Thought || Immunity to Error Through Misidentification\n2.3 Immunity to Error Through Misidentification\n\nIn The Blue and Brown Books, Wittgenstein distinguishes\nbetween two uses of the term \u201cI\u201d which he calls the\n\u201cuse as subject\u201d and the \u201cuse as object\u201d\n(1958: 66\u201370; Garrett 1998: ch. 8; cf. James\u2019 distinction\nbetween the I, or pure ego, and the me, or empirical\nself (1890: vol. 1, ch. X)). As Wittgenstein describes the difference,\nthere is a certain kind of error in thought that is possible when\n\u201cI\u201d is used as object but not when \u201cI\u201d is used\nas subject. Wittgenstein notes that if I find myself in a tangle of\nbodies, I may wrongly take another\u2019s visibly broken arm to be my\nown, mistakenly judging \u201cI have a broken arm\u201d. Upon seeing\na broken arm, then, it can make sense to wonder whether or not it is\nmine. If, however, I feel a pain in the arm, and on that basis judge\n\u201cI have a pain\u201d, then it makes no sense at all for me to\nwonder whether the pain of which I am aware is mine. That is, it is\nnot possible for me to be aware, in the ordinary way, of a pain in an\narm but mistakenly judge it to be my own arm that hurts. On this\npicture, self-ascriptions of pain, at least when based on the usual\nintrospective grounds, involve the use of \u201cI\u201d as\nsubject and so are immune to this sort of error of\nmisidentification.\n\nImmunity to this sort of error should not be conflated with another\nsort of epistemic security that is often discussed under the heading\nof self-knowledge (see entry on\n self-knowledge).\n Some philosophers have held that, for a range of mental states, one\ncannot be mistaken about whether one is in them. Thus, for example, if\none sincerely judges that one has a pain, or that one believes that P,\nthen it cannot turn out that one is not in pain, or that one does not\nso believe. That the kind of immunity to error described by\nWittgenstein differs from this sort of epistemic security follows from\nthe fact that one may be sceptical of the latter while accepting the\nformer. That is, one may reject the claim that sincere judgements that\none has a pain cannot be mistaken (perhaps it is possible to mistake a\nsensation of coldness for one of pain), whilst nevertheless\nmaintaining that if one is introspectively aware of a pain, then that\npain must be one\u2019s own. Immunity to errors of this sort has been\ntaken, by a number of philosophers, to be importantly connected to\nself-consciousness.\n\nUnder the influence of Shoemaker (1968) this phenomenon has become\nknown as immunity to error through misidentification relative to the\nfirst-person pronoun, or IEM. On Shoemaker\u2019s formulation, an\nerror of misidentification occurs when one knows some particular\nthing, a, to be F and judges that b is F\non the grounds that one mistakenly believes that a is identical\nto b. To this it is important to add that IEM is not a feature\nthat judgements possess in virtue of their content alone but only\nrelative to certain grounds (perception, testimony,\n introspection,\n memory, etc.). Thus, the judgement that I \nam jealous of a\nmight be IEM when grounded in introspection, but not when grounded in\nthe overheard testimony of my analyst. For I may have misinterpreted\nmy analyst\u2019s words, wrongly taking his use of\n\u201cSmith\u201d in \u201cSmith is Jealous of a\u201d to\nrefer to me (\u201cSmith\u201d after all is a common name). IEM is\nalways relative, then, to the grounds on which a judgement is based.\nWhich grounds might give rise to first-person judgements that are IEM\nis a contested matter, see the supplement:\n The Scope of Immunity to Error Through Misidentification.\n\nOn this account, first-person thoughts will be IEM relative to certain\ngrounds just in case errors of misidentification are not possible with\nrespect to them. That is, they will be IEM relative to grounds\nG if and only if it is not possible that one knows,\nvia G, some particular thing, a, to be F\nand judges oneself to be F in virtue of mistakenly believing\nthat a is identical to oneself. Whilst precise formulations\ndiffer in various ways, this can reasonably be thought of as the\nstandard account of IEM (see, for example, Shoemaker 1968, 1970, 1986,\n2012; Brewer 1995; Berm\u00fadez 1998: \u00a71.2; Peacocke 1999: ch.\n6; 2008: \u00a73.2; 2014: \u00a75.1; Coliva 2006; Recanati 2007: part\n6; Perry 2012; most of the papers in Prosser & Recanati 2012;\nMusholt 2015: ch. 1).\n\nAn alternative way of formulating IEM can be found in the work of\nvariety of philosophers. On this view, a judgement \u201ca is\nF\u201d is IEM if and only if it is not possible to undercut\none\u2019s evidence for judging that a is F without\nthereby undercutting one\u2019s evidence that someone is\nF (for variations on this idea, see Hamilton 1995; Wright 1998;\nPryor 1999; Campbell 1999a; 2002: ch. 5; for discussion see Coliva\n2006; Joel Smith 2006a; McGlynn 2016). As Wright puts it, a claim \n\n\nmade on a certain kind of ground involves immunity to error through\nmisidentification just when its defeat is not consistent with\nretention of grounds for existential generalization. (1998: 19) \n\n\nThe idea is that, for a wide range of judgements it is possible that\none knows that something is F but wrongly supposes that\na is F. That is, one has misidentified which thing is F.\nFor other judgements, perhaps including the introspection based\njudgement that one has a headache, this sort of identification error\nis not possible. After Pryor\u2019s (1999) influential discussion,\nthis is typically known as immunity to\nwhich-misidentification, or wh-IEM.\n\nThat wh-IEM is a distinct phenomenon from IEM as it is standardly\nformulated is shown by the fact one may consistently claim that a form\nof experience, for example memory, does not put one in a position to\nthink, of some a distinct from oneself, that a was\nF, yet nevertheless does put one in a position to think that\nsomeone was F. That is, it might give rise to\njudgements that are IEM but not wh-IEM. The converse,\nhowever, is not possible. For since \u201ca was\nF\u201d entails \u201csomeone was F\u201d,\nit will not be possible for a judgement, relative to some grounds, to\nbe wh-IEM without it also being IEM. If a judgement is based\non an identification, it will be subject to errors of\nwh-misidentification. For this reason, wh-IEM might\nlegitimately be considered the more fundamental notion (as it is by\nPryor 1999).\n\nWhat is the philosophical significance of IEM? First, consider what it\nwould take for a form of experience to ground thoughts that are IEM.\nSuppose that a form of experience, introspection for example, itself\nhas first-personal content. That is, suppose that the content of\nintrospective awareness is not adequately conceptualised as\npain but rather requires the first-personal form, my\npain. If so, then there would be no need for an identification of\nsome object as oneself, for the identity of the subject of pain is\nalready given as oneself. On this way of thinking, to determine which\nforms of experience ground judgements that are IEM would be to\ndetermine which forms of experience have first-personal content. And\nthat, according to some philosophers, is to determine which forms of\nexperience are themselves forms of self-consciousness (see, for\nexample, Berm\u00fadez 1998: 144). This issue is further discussed\nin\n \u00a73.\n\nSecond, Wittgenstein suggests that the phenomenon of IEM is\nresponsible for the (in his view, mistaken) opinion that the use of\n\u201cI\u201d as subject refers to an immaterial soul (1958: 66).\nThis is for the reason that one may be tempted to suppose that if\nintrospectively based self-ascriptions of psychological predicates do\nnot rely on an identification of a bodily entity, they must rely on\nthe identification of a non-bodily entity (1958: 70; for related\ndiscussion, see Peacocke 1999: ch. 6; Coliva 2012).\nWittgenstein\u2019s view, of course, is that they rely on no\nidentification at all. As Evans puts it, they are identification-free.\nEssentially the same point is made by Strawson in his diagnosis of\n\u201cthe fact that lies at the root of the Cartesian\nillusion\u201d, which is that \u201ccriterionless\u201d\nself-ascription gives rise to the idea of a \u201cpurely inner and\nyet subject-referring use for \u2018I\u2019\u201d (P.F. Strawson\n1966: 164\u2013166). In short, the fact that a certain class of\nfirst-person thoughts depend for their reference on no identification\nof myself as some publicly presented object (they are\nidentification-free) gives rise to the idea that they pick out a\nprivate object, a soul. There is a clear connection between this idea\nand Anscombe\u2019s (1975) argument for the non-referential character\nof \u201cI\u201d. \n",
