    "main_text": "What are the Proper Limits of Health Care? || Normal Function Accounts\n2.2 Normal Function Accounts\nThere is another approach to interpreting the treatment/enhancement\ndistinction that seeks to provide a firmer theoretical foundation for\ndelimiting legitimate health care needs. On this approach, to be\nhealthy is to be able to do all that appropriately matched members of\none\u2019s own species can do, in our case what human beings of\nsimilar age and gender can do. Legitimate health care needs or\n\u201chealth problems\u201d or \u201cdiseases\u201d or\n\u201cmaladies\u201d are all characterized by a fall from that level\nof functional capacity. All proper health care services, therefore,\nshould be aimed at getting people back to \u201cnormal\u201d, e.g.,\nrestoring an individual\u2019s functional capability to the\nspecies-typical range for their reference class, and within that range\nto the particular capability level which was the patient\u2019s\ngenetic birthright. Interventions which take people to the top of\ntheir personal potential (like athletic training) or beyond their own\nbirth range (like growth hormone), or to the top of the range of their\nreference class, or to the top of the species-typical range, or beyond\n(!), are all to be counted as enhancements and fall successively\nfurther beyond the responsibility of medicine or health care.\nThe advantage of the normal function account is that it provides a\nsingle (relatively) unified goal for health care, towards which the\nburdens and benefits of various interventions can be relatively\nobjectively titrated, balanced, and integrated. Normal functionalists\ncan use physiology to determine when they\u2019ve achieved the\nspecies typical range and clinical histories to determine when\nthey\u2019ve brought a patient up to the baseline of his or her\npersonal capability range.\nSome critics of the normal function approach take issue with its\nfocus on the \u201cspecies-typical range\u201d, arguing that it is\ninsensitive to the diversity of ways in which human beings can\nflourish in life. They point out that those born with disabilities may\nbe wary of biomedicine\u2019s \u201cfatal attraction to\nnormalizing\u201d.( Silvers, 1998; Asch and Block, 2011) Moreover,\neven when no amount of treatment can give someone \u201cspecies\ntypical\u201d functioning, there may be compensatory technologies\nthat can actually expand their range of opportunities beyond the norm\n(Silvers 1998). Should powered wheelchairs be designed to slow and\nstop at the same distance that walking humans would succumb to\nfatigue, in order to keep them from \u201cenhancing\u201d their\nusers\u2019 abilities? By the same token, the naturally gifted may\nfind that they have no claim to treatment for injuries or accidents\nthat merely bring them down into the \u201cnormal range\u201d. If\nour champion thinkers, athletes and saints can legitimately claim\ntreatment for problems that impair their species-optimal functioning,\nbringing the rest of us up to their levels should count as proper\nhealth care as well. But that leaves only the most extreme\nimprovements on the other side of the \u201cenhancement\u201d\nboundary: if our species champions are the benchmark, only\ninterventions that create capacities no human has had before would\nfall beyond medicine\u2019s proper domain.  Individualizing the\noptimal functional range to individual genomic potentials will not\nresolve this problem, of course, to the extent that our genomes\nthemselves become biomedically malleable. Establishing the\n\u201cspecies-typical norm\u201d for a particular human function is\na difficult enough task, even where descriptive statistics can\nhelp. But when the boundary is \u201coptimal\u201d not\n\u201cnormal\u201d functioning, the evidentiary foundations of the\napproach begin to come apart (Sculley and Rehman-Sutter 2008).\nThe second serious problem for the normal function approach is the\nchallenge of prevention. While some efforts at health promotion, such\nas exercise, straddle the border of medical responsibility, many\npreventive interventions (i.e., vaccines) are widely accepted as\nlegitimate parts of medicine\u2019s mission and are located squarely\non the treatment side of the enhancement boundary. One of the ways to\nprevent disease is to strengthen the body\u2019s ability to resist\npathological changes before any diagnosable problem appears. But to the\nextent that prevention attempts to elevate bodily functions above the\nnormal range for the individual (and, in some cases, even the species\ntypical range), it seems to slide into what the normal function\napproach would call enhancement. If the normal function account is\ntaken seriously as a biomedical boundary marker, how does one defend\nthis kind of prevention? Conversely, if preventive interventions like\nthese are acceptable in medicine, what can it mean to claim that\nresearchers and clinicians should be \u201cdrawing the line\u201d at\nenhancement?\n",
