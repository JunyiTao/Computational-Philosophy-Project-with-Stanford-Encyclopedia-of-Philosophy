    "main_text": "The Case for the Church-Turing Thesis || Turing on the status of the thesis\n4.6 Turing on the status of the thesis\n\nAs\n Section 3.4\n mentioned, Dershowitz and Gurevich have also argued that the\nChurch-Turing thesis is susceptible to mathematical proof (Dershowitz\n& Gurevich 2008). They offer \u201ca proof of Church\u2019s\nThesis, as G\u00f6del and others suggested may be possible\u201d\n(2008: 299), and they add:\n\n\nIn a similar way, but with a different set of basic operations, one\ncan prove Turing\u2019s Thesis, \u2026 . (Dershowitz & Gurevich\n2008: 299)\n\n\nYet Turing\u2019s own view of the status of his thesis is very\ndifferent from that expressed by Kripke, Dershowitz and Gurevich.\nAccording to Turing, his thesis is not susceptible to mathematical\nproof. He did not consider either argument I or argument II to be a\nmathematical demonstration of his thesis: he asserted that I and II,\nand indeed \u201c[a]ll arguments which can be given\u201d for the\nthesis, are\n\n\nfundamentally, appeals to intuition, and for this reason rather\nunsatisfactory mathematically. (Turing 1936 [2004: 74])\n\n\nIndeed, Turing might have regarded \u201cHilbert\u2019s\nthesis\u201d as itself an example of a proposition that can be\njustified only by appeals to intuition.\n\nTuring discussed a thesis closely related to Turing\u2019s thesis,\nnamely for every systematic method there is a corresponding\nsubstitution-puzzle (where \u201csubstitution-puzzle\u201d,\nlike \u201ccomputable by Turing machine\u201d, is a rigorously\ndefined concept). He said:\n\n\nThe statement is \u2026 one which one does not attempt to prove.\nPropaganda is more appropriate to it than proof, for its status is\nsomething between a theorem and a definition. (Turing 1954 [2004:\n588])\n\n\nProbably Turing would have taken this remark to apply equally to the\nthesis (Turing\u2019s thesis) that for every systematic method\nthere is a corresponding Turing machine.\n\nTuring also said (in handwritten material published in 2004) that the\nphrase \u201csystematic method\u201d\n\n\nis a phrase which, like many others e.g., \u201cvegetable\u201d one\nunderstands well enough in the ordinary way. But one can have\ndifficulties when speaking to greengrocers or microbiologists or when\nplaying \u201ctwenty questions\u201d. Are rhubarb and tomatoes\nvegetables or fruits? Is coal vegetable or mineral? What about coal\ngas, marrow, fossilised trees, streptococci, viruses? Has the lettuce\nI ate at lunch yet become animal? \u2026 The same sort of difficulty\narises about question c) above [Is there a systematic method by\nwhich I can answer such-and-such questions?]. An ordinary sort of\nacquaintance with the meaning of the phrase \u201csystematic\nmethod\u201d won\u2019t do, because one has got to be able to say\nquite clearly about any kind of method that might be proposed whether\nit is allowable or not. (Turing in Copeland 2004: 590)\n\n\nHere Turing is emphasizing that the term \u201csystematic\nmethod\u201d is not exact, and so in that respect is like the term\n\u201cvegetable\u201d, and unlike mathematically precise terms such\nas \u201c\u03bb-definable\u201d, \u201cTuring-machine\ncomputable\u201d, and \u201csubstitution-puzzle\u201d. Kleene\nclaimed that, since terms like \u201csystematic method\u201d and\n\u201ceffectively calculable\u201d are not exact, theses involving\nthem cannot be proved (op. cit.). Turing however did not voice a\nsimilar argument (perhaps because he saw a difficulty). The fact that\nthe term \u201csystematic method\u201d is inexact is not\nenough to show that there could be no mathematically acceptable proof\nof a thesis involving the term. Mendelson gave a graphic statement of\nthis point, writing about what is called above \u201cthe converse\nof Church\u2019s thesis\u201d\n (Section 1.5):\n\n\nThe assumption that a proof connecting intuitive and precise\nmathematical notions is impossible is patently false. In fact, half of\nCT (the \u201ceasier\u201d half), the assertion that all\npartial-recursive functions are effectively computable, is\nacknowledged to be obvious in all textbooks in recursion theory. A\nstraightforward argument can be given for it\u2026. This simple\nargument is as clear a proof as I have seen in mathematics, and it is\na proof in spite of the fact that it involves the intuitive notion of\neffective computability. (Mendelson 1990: 232\u2013233)\n\n\nYet the point that the \u201cintuitive\u201d nature of some of its\nterms does not rule out the thesis\u2019s being provable is not to\nsay that the thesis is provable. If the status of the\nChurch-Turing thesis is \u201csomething between a theorem and a\ndefinition\u201d, then the definition is presumably Church\u2019s\nproposal to \u201cdefine the notion \u2026 of an effectively\ncalculable function\u201d\n (Section 1.5)\n and the theorem is Turing\u2019s computation theorem\n (Section 4.3.5),\n i.e., that given Turing\u2019s account of the essential features of\nhuman computation, Turing\u2019s thesis is true. This theorem is\ndemonstrable, but to prove the thesis itself from the theorem, it\nwould be necessary to show, with mathematical certainty, that\nTuring\u2019s account of the essential features of human computation\nis correct. So far, no one has done this. Propaganda does seem more\nappropriate than proof.\n",
