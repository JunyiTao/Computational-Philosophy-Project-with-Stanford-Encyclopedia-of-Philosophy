    "main_text": "\n\nIndividual autonomy is an idea that is generally understood to refer\nto the capacity to be one\u2019s own person, to live one\u2019s life\naccording to reasons and motives that are taken as one\u2019s own and\nnot the product of manipulative or distorting external forces, to be\nin this way independent. It is a central value in the Kantian\ntradition of moral philosophy but it is also given fundamental status\nin John Stuart Mill\u2019s version of utilitarian liberalism (Kant\n1785/1983, Mill 1859/1975, ch. III). Examination of the concept of\nautonomy also figures centrally in debates over education policy,\nbiomedical ethics, various legal freedoms and rights (such as freedom\nof speech and the right to privacy), as well as moral and political\ntheory more broadly. In the realm of moral theory, seeing autonomy as\na central value can be contrasted with alternative frameworks such an\nethic of care, utilitarianism of some kinds, and an ethic of virtue.\nAutonomy has traditionally been thought to connote independence and\nhence to reflect assumptions of individualism in both moral thinking\nand designations of political status. For this reason, certain\nphilosophical movements, such as certain strains of feminism, have\nresisted seeing autonomy as a value (Jaggar 1983, chap. 3). However,\nin recent decades, theorists have increasingly tried to structure the\nconcept so as to sever its ties to this brand of individualism. \n\nIn all such discussions the concept of autonomy is the focus of much\ncontroversy and debate, disputes which focus attention on the\nfundamentals of moral and political philosophy and the Enlightenment\nconception of the person more generally.\n",
