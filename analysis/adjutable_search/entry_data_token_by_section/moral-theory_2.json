This is the topic of works such as\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics, in which the aim of\nhuman beings is to exemplify human excellence of character. The sense\nin which we understand it here is that ethics is broader than morality,\nand includes considerations of personal development of oneself and\nloved ones. This personal development is important to a life well\nlived, intuitively, since our very identities are centered on projects\nthat we find important. Bernard Williams and others refer to\nthese projects as \u201cground projects\u201d. These are the\nsources of many of our reasons for acting. For Williams, if\nan agent seeks to adopt moral considerations, or be guided by\nthem, then important ethical considerations are neglected,\nsuch as personal integrity and authenticity (Williams 1977; Wolf\n1982). However, Williams has a very narrow view of what he\nfamously termed \u201cthe morality system\u201d (Williams 1985).\n\nWilliams lists a variety of objectionable features of the morality\nsystem, including the inescapability of moral obligations, the\noverridingness of moral obligation, impartiality, and\nthe fact that in the morality system there is a push towards\ngeneralization.\n\nThere has been considerable discussion of each of these features of\nthe morality system, and since Williams, a great deal of work on the\npart of standard moral theorists on how each theory addresses the\nconsiderations he raised. Williams\u2019 critique of the\nmorality system was part of a general criticism of moral theory in the\n1980s on the grounds of its uselessness, harmfulness, and even its\nimpossibility (Clarke 1987). This anti-theory trend was prompted\nby the same dissatisfaction with consequentialism and deontology that\nled to the resurgence of Virtue Ethics.\n\nA major criticism of this view is that it has a very narrow view of\nwhat counts as a moral theory. Thus, some of these approaches\nsimply rejected some features of William\u2019s characterization of\nthe morality system, such as impartiality. Others, however,\nWilliams\u2019 included, attacked the very project of moral\ntheory. This is the \u2018anti-theory\u2019 attack on moral\ntheorizing. For example, Annette Baier argued that\nmorality cannot be captured in a system of rules, and this was a very\npopular theme amongst early virtue ethicists. On this view, moral\ntheory which systematizes and states the moral principles that ought to\nguide actions is simply impossible: \u201cNorms in the form of\nvirtues may be essentially imprecise in some crucial ways, may be\nmutually referential, but not hierarchically orderable, may be\nessentially self-referential\u201d (Baier 220). \n\nRobert Louden even argued that the best construal of virtue ethics\nis not as an ethical theory, but as anti-theory that should not be\nevaluated as attempting to theorize morality at all. (Louden\n1990). According to Louden, moral theories are formulated\nto a variety of reasons, including to provide solutions to problems,\nformulas for action, universal principles, etc. Louden notes that this\ncharacterization is very narrow and many would object to it, but he\nviews anti-theory not so much as a position against any kind\nof moral theorizing, but simply the kind that he viewed as predominant\nprior to the advent of Virtue Ethics. This is a much less severe\nversion of anti-theory as it, for example, doesn\u2019t seem to regard\nweightiness or importance of moral reasons as a problem.\n\nSome of the problems that Williams and other anti-theorists have\nposed for morality, based on the above characteristics, are:\n\nMorality is too demanding and pervasive: that is, the view that\nmoral reasons are weighty indicates that we should be giving them\npriority over other sorts of reasons. Further, they leach into\nall aspects of our lives, leaving very little morally neutral.\nMorality is alienating. There are a variety of ways in which\nmorality can be alienating. As Adrian Piper notes, morality might\nalienate the agent from herself or might alienate the agent from others\n\u2013 impartiality and universality might lead to this, for example\n(Piper 1987; Stocker 1976). Another way we can understand\nalienation is that the agent is alienated from the true justifications\nof her own actions \u2013 this is one way to hold that theories which\nopt for indirection can lead to alienation (see section 4 below).\nMorality, because it is impartial, makes no room for special\nobligations. That is, if the right action is the one that is impartial\nbetween persons, then it does not favor the near and dear. On this\npicture it is difficult to account for the moral requirements that\nparents have towards their own children, and friends have towards each\nother. These requirements are, by their nature, not\nimpartial.\nMorality is committed to providing guides for action that can\nbe captured in a set of rules or general principles. That is, morality\nis codifiable and the rules of morality are general. \n\n\nMorality requires too much. The basic worry is that the morality\nsystem is voracious and is creeping into all aspects of our lives, to\nthe detriment of other important values. The worry expressed by 4 takes\na variety of forms. For example, some take issue with a\npresupposition of 4, arguing that there are no moral principles at all if we\nthink of these principles as guiding action. Some argue\nthat there are no moral principles that are complete, because morality\nis not something that is codifiable. And, even if\nmorality was codifiable, the \u2018principles\u2019 would be\nextremely specific, and not qualify as principles at all.\n\nSince Williams\u2019 work, philosophers have tried to respond to\nthe alienation worry by, for example, providing accounts of the ways in\nwhich a person\u2019s reasons can guide without forming an explicit\npart of practical deliberation. Peter Railton, for example,\nargues in favor of a form of objective consequentialism,\nSophisticated Consequentialism, in which the rightness of an\naction is a function of its actual consequences (Railton 1984). \nOn Railton\u2019s view, one can be a good consequentialist without\nbeing alienated from loved ones. Though not attempting to defend moral\ntheory per se, other writers have also provided accounts of\nhow agents can act on the basis of reasons \u2013 and thus perform\nmorally worthy actions, even though these reasons are not explicitly\narticulated in their practical deliberations (Arpaly 2002; Markovits\n2014). Deontologists have argued that autonomous action needn\u2019t\ninvolve explicit invocation of, for example, the Categorical Imperative\n(Herman 1985). Generally, what characterizes these moves is the\nidea that the justifying reasons are present in some form in the\nagent\u2019s psychology \u2013 they are recoverable from the\nagent\u2019s psychology \u2013 but need not be explicitly articulated\nor invoked by the agent in acting rightly. \n\nOne way to elaborate on this strategy is to argue that the morally\ngood agent is one who responds to the right sorts of reasons, even\nthough the agent can\u2019t articulate the nature of the response\n(Arpaly 2002). This strategy makes no appeal to codifiable principles,\nand is compatible with a wide variety of approaches to developing a\nmoral theory. It relies heavily on the concept, of course, of\n\u201creason\u201d and \u201cmoral reason,\u201d which many writers\non moral issues take to be fundamental or basic in any case.\n\nThere has also been debate concerning the proper scope of morality,\nand how moral theories can address problems relating to\nimpartiality. Kant and the classical utilitarians believed that moral\nreasons are impartial, what others have termed agent-neutral. Indeed,\nthis is one point of criticism that virtue ethics has made of these\ntwo theories. One might argue that moral reasons are impartial, but\nthat there are other reasons that successfully compete with them\n\u2013 reasons relating to the near and dear, for example, or\none\u2019s own ground projects. Or, one could hold that morality\nincludes special reasons, arising from special obligations, that also\nmorally justify our actions.\n\nThe first strategy has been pursued by Bernard Williams and other\n\u201canti-theorists\u201d. Again, Williams argues that\nmorality is a special system that we would be better off without\n(Williams 1985). In the morality system we see a special sense of\n\u201cobligation\u201d \u2013 moral obligation \u2013 which\npossesses certain features. For example, moral obligation is\ninescapable according to the morality system. A theory\nsuch as Kant\u2019s, for example, holds that we must act in\naccordance with the Categorical Imperative. It is not\noptional. This is because morality is represented as having\nauthority over us in ways that even demand sacrifice of our personal\nprojects, of the very things that make our lives go well for us. \nThis seems especially clear for Utilitarianism, which holds that we\nmust maximize the good, and falling short of maximization is\nwrong. A Kantian will try to avoid this problem by\nappealing to obligations that are less demanding, the imperfect ones.\nBut, as Williams points out, these are still obligations, and\nas such can only be overridden by other obligations. Thus, the\ntheories also tend to present morality as pervasive in that\nmorality creeps into every aspect of our lives, making no room for\nneutral decisions. For example, even decisions about what shoes\nto wear to work becomes a moral one:\n\nOnce the journey into more general obligations has started, we may\nbegin to get into trouble \u2013 not just philosophical trouble, but\nthe conscience trouble \u2013 with finding room for morally\nindifferent actions. I have already mentioned the possible moral\nconclusion that one may take some particular course of action. \nThat means that there is nothing else I am obliged to do. But if we have\naccepted general and indeterminate obligations to further various moral\nobjectives\u2026they will be waiting to provide work for idle\nhands\u2026 (Williams 1985, 181)\n\nHe goes on to write that in order to get out of this problem,\n\u201c\u2026I shall need one of those fraudulent items, a duty to\nmyself\u201d (Williams 1985, 182). Kantian Ethics does supply\nthis. Many find this counterintuitive, since the self/other\nasymmetry seems to capture the prudence/morality distinction, but\nKantians such as Tom Hill, jr. have made strong cases for at least\nsome moral duties to the self. In any case, for writers such\nas Williams, so much the worse for morality.\n\nOther writers, also concerned about the problems that Williams has\nraised argue, instead, that morality does make room for our partial\nconcerns and projects, such as the norms governing our relationships,\nand our meaningful projects. Virtue ethicists, for example, are\noften comfortable pointing out that morality is not thoroughly\nimpartial because there are virtues of partiality. Being a good\nmother involves having a preference for the well-being of one\u2019s\nown children. The mother who really is impartial would be a very\nbad mother, lacking in the appropriate virtues. \n\nAnother option is to hold that there are partial norms, but those\npartial norms are themselves justified on impartial grounds. This\ncan be spelled out in a variety of different ways. Consider\nMarcia Baron\u2019s defense of impartiality, where she notes that\ncritics of impartiality are mistaken because they confuse\nlevels of justification: \u201cCritics suppose that\nimpartialists insisting on impartiality at the level of rules or\nprinciples are committed to insisting on impartiality at the level of\ndeciding what to do in one\u2019s day-to-day activities\u201d (Baron\n1991). This is a mistake because impartialists can justify\npartial norms by appealing to impartial rules or principles. She\nis correct about this. Even Jeremy Bentham believed, for example,\nthat the principle of utility ought not be applied in every case,\nthough he mainly appealed to efficiency costs of using the principle\nall the time. But one can appeal to other considerations. \nFrank Jackson uses an analogy with predators to argue that partial\nnorms are strategies for maximizing the good, they offer the best\nchance of actually doing so given our limitations (Jackson 1991). \nSimilarly, a Kantian such as Tom Hill, jr., as Baron notes, can argue\nthat impartiality is part of an ideal, and ought not govern our\nday-to-day lives (Hill 1987). Does this alienate people from\nothers? The typical mother shows the right amount of preference\nfor her child, let\u2019s say, but doesn\u2019t herself think that\nthis is justified on the basis of promoting the good, for\nexample. A friend visits another in the hospital and also does\nnot view the partiality as justified by any further principles. \nBut this is no more alienating than someone being able to make good\narguments and criticize bad ones without a knowledge of inference\nrules. Maybe it is better to have an awareness of the underlying\njustification, but for some theories even that is debatable. For\nan objective theorist (see below) it may be that knowing the underlying\njustification can interfere with doing the right thing, in which case\nit is better not to know. For some theorists, however, such as\nneo-Aristotelian virtue ethicists, a person is not truly virtuous\nwithout such knowledge and understanding, though Rosalind Hursthouse\n(1999) does not make this a requirement of right action.\n\nRecently consequentialists have been approaching this issue through\nthe theory of value itself, arguing that there are agent-relative forms\nof value. This approach is able to explain the intuitions that\nsupport partial moral norms while retaining the general structure of\nconsequentialism (Sen 2000). Douglas Portmore, for example,\nargues for a form of consequentialism that he terms \u201ccommonsense\nconsequentialism\u201d as it is able to accommodate many of our\neveryday moral intuitions (Portmore 2011). He does so by arguing\nthat (1) the deontic status of an act, whether it is right or wrong, is\ndetermined by what reasons the agent has for performing it \u2013 if\nan agent has a decisive reason to perform the act in question, then it\nis morally required. Combined with (2) a teleological view of\npractical reasons in which our reasons for performing an action are a\nfunction of what we have reason to prefer or desire we are led to a\nform of act-consequentialism but one which is open to accepting that we\nhave reason to prefer or desire the well-being of the near and dear\nover others.\n\nThough much of this is controversial, there is general agreement\nthat moral reasons are weighty, are not egoistic\n\u2013 that is, to be contrasted with prudential reasons, and are\nconcerned with issues of value [duty, fittingness].\n1.2.2. Morality and Aesthetics\n\nMoral modes of evaluation are distinct from the aesthetic in terms\nof their content, but also in terms of their authority. So, for\nexample, works of art are evaluated as \u201cbeautiful\u201d or\n\u201cugly\u201d, and those evaluations are not generally considered\nas universal or as objective as moral evaluations. These\ndistinctions between moral evaluation and aesthetic evaluation have\nbeen challenged, and are the subject of some interesting debates in\nmetaethics on the nature of both moral and aesthetic norms and the\ntruth-conditions of moral and aesthetic claims. But, considered\nintuitively, aesthetics seems at least less objective than\nmorality.\n\nA number of writers have noted that we need to be cognizant of the\ndistinction between moral norms and the norms specific to other\nnormative areas in order to avoid fallacies of evaluation, and much\ndiscussion has centered on a problem in aesthetics termed the\n\u201cMoralistic Fallacy\u201d (D\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2000).\n\nOne challenge that the anti-theorists have raised for morality was\nto note that in a person\u2019s life there will be certain norm\nclashes \u2013 including clashes between types of norms such\nas the moral and the aesthetic. It is giving too much prominence\nto the moral that judges a person\u2019s life as going well relative\nto the fulfillment or respect of those norms. Can\u2019t a\nhuman life go well, even when that life sacrifices morality for\naesthetics?\n\nThis sort of debate has a long history in moral theory. For\nexample, it arose as a form of criticism of G. E. Moore\u2019s Ideal\nUtilitarianism, which treated beauty as an intrinsic good, and\nrendering trade-offs between behaving well towards others and creating\nbeauty at least in principle justified morally (Moore\n1903). But the anti-theorists do not pursue this method of\naccommodating the aesthetic, instead arguing that it is a separate\nnormative realm which has its own weight and significance in human\nflourishing.\n",
