Bargaining theory, as it was developed by John Nash (1950)\nand John Harsanyi (1977) is a rigorous approach to modeling how\nrational individuals would agree to divide some good or surplus. In\nits most general form, the bargaining model of agreement specifies\nsome set of individuals who have individual utility functions that can\nbe represented in relation to one other without requiring\ninterpersonal comparisons of utility directly. Some surplus is\nspecified and if the individuals involved can agree on how to divide\nthe good in question, they will get that division. If, however, they\ncannot agree they will instead get their disagreement result. This may\nbe what they brought to the table or it could be some other specified\namount. One example is a simple demand game where two people must\nwrite down how much of given pot of money they want. If the two\n\u201cbids\u201d amount to equal or less than the pot, each will get\nwhat he or she wrote down, otherwise each will get nothing.\n\nAs Rawls recognized in his 1958 essay \u201cJustice as\nFairness\u201d one way for parties to resolve their disagreements is\nto employ bargaining solutions, such as that proposed by R.B.\nBraithwaite (1955). Rawls himself rejected bargaining solutions to the\nsocial contract since, in his opinion, such solutions rely on\n\u201cthreat advantage\u201d (i.e., disagreement result) and\n\u201cto each according to his threat advantage is hardly a principle\nof fairness\u201d (Rawls 1958, 58n). In addition to Rawls\u2019s\nconcern about threat advantage, a drawback of all such approaches is\nthe multiplicity of bargaining solutions, which can significantly\ndiffer. Although the Nash solution is most favored today, it can have\ncounter-intuitive implications. Furthermore, there are many who argue\nthat bargaining solutions are inherently indeterminate and so the only\nway to achieve determinacy is to introduce unrealistic or\ncontroversial assumptions (Sugden, 1990, 1991; Thrasher 2014). Similar\nproblems also exist for equilibrium selection in games (see\nVanderschraaf 2005 and Harsanyi and Selten 1988).\n\nGauthier famously pursued the bargaining approach, building his Morals\nby Agreement on his bargaining solution, minimax relative concession,\nwhich is equivalent to the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution in\nthe two-person case (see also Gaus 1990, Ch. IX). Binmore (2005) has\nrecently advanced a version of social contract theory that relies on\nthe Nash bargaining solution, as does Ryan Muldoon (2017) while\nMoehler (2018) relies on a \u201cstabilized\u201d Nash bargaining\nsolution. In later work, Gauthier (1993) shifted from minimax relative\nconcession to the Nash solution. Gauthier has since adopted a less\nformal approach to bargaining that is, nevertheless, closer to his\noriginal solution than to the Nash Solution (2013).\n\nMany of the recent developments in bargaining theory and the social\ncontract have adopted dynamic (Muldoon 2017, Vanderschraaf 2018) or\neven evolutionary approaches to modeling bargaining (Alexander and\nSkyrms 1999, Skyrms 2014). This highlights a general divide in\nbargaining models between what we can call axiomatic and\nprocess models. The traditional, axiomatic, approach to the\nbargaining problem going back to John Nash, codified by John Harsanyi,\nand popularized by R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa (1957). Out of\nthis tradition has come several core bargaining solutions. Each uses a\nslightly different set of axioms to generate a unique and generally\napplicable way to divide a surplus. These include, most notably, the\negalitarian (Raiffa 1953), the Nash (1950), the stabilized Nash\n(Moehler 2010), the Kalai-Smorodinsky (1975), and Gauthier\u2019s\nminimax relative concession (1986). The main point of contention among\nthese theories is whether to employ Nash\u2019s independence axiom or\nto use a monotonicity axiom (as the egalitarian, Kalai-Smorodinsky,\nand minimax relative concession do), although, to one degree or\nanother all of the axioms have been contested.\n\nThe other approach is what we can call a process model.\nInstead of using various axioms to generate a uniquely rational\nsolution, these theorists rely on some procedure that will generate a\ndeterminate, though not always unique result. Process approaches use\nsome mechanism to generate agreement. An example is an auction. There\nare many types of auctions (e.g., English, Dutch, Vickrey, etc.), each\nhas a way of generating bids on some good and then deciding on a\nprice. Posted price selling, like one often sees in consumer markets,\nare also a kind of bargain, though an extremely asymmetric one where\nthe seller has offered a \u201ctake or leave it\u201d ask.\nDouble-auctions are more symmetrical and have a clearer link to the\ninitial bargaining model. Although auctions are not typically used to\nsolve pure division problems, there are some examples of auction\nmechanisms being used to solve public goods problems in interesting\nways that guarantee unanimity (Smith 1977). Dworkin also uses a kind\nof auction mechanism in his work on equality, though he doesn\u2019t\ndevelop his approach for more general application (Dworkin 1981, Heath\n2004). Despite its promise, however, auction theory and its potential\napplication to social contract theory have largely gone\nunexploited.\n\nThe main process approach to bargaining derives from the influential\nwork of Rubinstein (1982) and his proof that it is possible to show\nthat an alternating offer bargaining process will generate the same\nresult as Nash\u2019s axiomatic solution in certain cases. This\nresult added life to Nash\u2019s (1950) early observation that\nbargaining and the rules of bargaining must be the result of some\nnon-cooperative game, with the idea being that it might be possible to\nunify bargaining theory and game theory. This approach, called the\nNash Program, is most notably championed by Binmore (1998), whose\nevolutionary approach to the social contract relies on biological\nevolution (the game of life) to generate the background conditions of\nbargaining (the game of morals). Both can be modeled as\nnon-cooperative games and the later can be modeled as a bargaining\nproblem. By using this approach, Binmore (1998, 2005) claims to be\nable to show, in a robust and non-question-begging way, that something\nvery much like Rawls\u2019s \u201cjustice as fairness\u201d will be\nthe result of this evolutionary bargaining process.\n\nA more empirically minded approach follows Schelling\u2019s (1960)\nearly work on bargaining and game theory by looking at the way actual\npeople bargain and reach agreement. The pioneers of experimental\neconomics used laboratory experiments to look at how subjects behaved\nin division problems (Hoffman et. al. 2000, Smith 2003). Some of the\nmost interesting results came, perhaps surprisingly, from asymmetric\nbargaining games like the ultimatum game (Smith 1982). Since these\nearly experiments, considerable experimental work has been done on\nbargaining problems and cooperative agreement in economics. Much of\nthe most philosophically relevant work involves the importance of\nsocial norms and conventions in determining the result (Bicchieri\n2016, Vanderschraaf 2018).\n\nAlthough appealing to a bargaining solution can give determinacy to a\nsocial contract, it does so at the cost of appealing to a\ncontroversial commensuration mechanism in the case of axiomatic\nbargaining or of moving to process approaches that must ultimately\nrely on the empirically contingent outcome of social and biological\nevolution. Although the importance of bargaining in the social\ncontract has been moribund for some time, recent work is changing that\n(see Alexander 2007, Thrasher 2014, Thoma 2015, Muldoon 2017, Moehler\n2018, Vanderschraaf 2018, Bruner 2020).\n",
