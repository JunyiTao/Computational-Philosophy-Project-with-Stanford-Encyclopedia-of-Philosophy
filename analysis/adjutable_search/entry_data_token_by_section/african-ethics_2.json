The Notion of Character as Central to African  Ethics\n\n\nThere are of course other moral concepts in the African moral\nlanguage and thought. The concepts of good, bad (or, evil), right and\nwrong feature prominently in African moral thought, as they do in the\nmoral systems of other peoples and cultures. In Akan, for instance,\npa or papa means good and bone means bad or\nevil (see below). Thus, the expression onipa bone means a bad\nperson. A bad person is said to be a person with a bad character,\nsuban bone. When a person is known to be honest or generous or\ncompassionate, he would be judged by the Akan as a good person, by\nwhich they mean that he has a good character (suban). A person would\nbe judged as having a bad character if he is considered\ndishonest, wicked, or cruel. In most moral evaluations reference is\nmade to the character of a person; thus, character is basic\u2014the\ncrucial element\u2014in Akan, as it is in African, ethics generally.\nIwa (character) is, for the Yoruba, \u201cperhaps the most\nimportant moral concept. A person is morally evaluated according to\nhis/her iwa\u2014whether good or bad\u201d (Gbadegesin, 1991:\n79). African ethics is, thus, a character-based ethics that maintains\nthat the quality of the individual's character is most\nfundamental in our moral life.\n\n\nGood character is the essence of the African moral system, the\nlinchpin of the moral wheel. The justification for a character-based\nethics is not far to seek. For, all that a society can do, regarding\nmoral conduct, is to impart moral knowledge to its members, making\nthem aware of the moral values and principles of that society. In\ngeneral, society satisfactorily fulfills this duty of imparting moral\nknowledge to its members through moral education of various forms,\nincluding, as in African societies, telling morally-freighted proverbs\nand folktales to its younger members. But, having moral\nknowledge\u2014being made aware of the moral principles and rules of\nthe society\u2014is one thing; being able to lead a life consonant\nwith the moral principles is quite another. An individual may know and\nmay even accept a moral rule, such as, say, it is wrong to cheat the\ncustoms. But he may fail to apply this rule to a particular situation;\nhe is, thus, not able to effect the transition from knowledge to\naction, to carry out the implications of his moral belief.\n\n\nIn the Akan and other African moral systems such a moral failure\nwould be put down to the lack of a good character (suban pa).\nIn other words, the ability to act in accord with the moral principles\nand rules of the society requires the possession of a good character.\nThus, in the context of the activities of the moral life\u2014in our\ndecisions to obey moral rules, in the struggle to do the right thing\nand to avoid the wrong conduct, in one's intention to carry out a\nmoral duty, the quality of a person's character is of ultimate\nconsequence. It is from a person's character that all his or her\nactions\u2014good or bad\u2014radiate: the performance of good or bad acts\ndepends on the state of one's character. Wrong-doing is put down\nto a person's bad character. Thus, the Yoruba maxim (proverb):\n\u2018Good character is a person's guard.\u2019\n\n\nAfrican maxims are explicit about the formation of character:\ncharacter is acquired. A person is therefore responsible for the state\nof his or her character, for character results from the habitual\nactions of a person. An Akan maxim has it that \u201cone is not born\nwith a bad \u2018head\u2019, but one takes it on from the\nearth.\u201d The maxim means, among other things, that a bad habit is\nnot an inborn characteristic; it is one that is acquired. It would be\nworthless to embark on moral instruction through moral proverbs and\nfolktales, as it is done in African societies, if our character or\nhabits were inborn. But the belief is that the moral narratives would\nhelp the young people to acquire and internalize the moral values of\nthe society, including specific moral virtues, embedded in those\nethical narratives. The appropriate responses to moral instruction are\nexpected to lead to the acquisition of appropriate habits and their\ncorresponding characters. And, because character is acquired through\nour actions, habits, and expected responses to moral instructions, it\ncan, according to African moral systems, be changed or\nreformed.\n\n\nCharacter is defined by the Akan thinkers in terms of habits, which\nresult from a person's deeds or actions: \u2018character comes\nfrom your actions\u2019 (or deeds: nneyee), says an Akan\ntraditional thinker. Persistent performance of a particular action will\nproduce a certain habit and, thus, a corresponding character. To\nacquire virtue, a person must perform good actions, that is, morally\nacceptable actions so that they become habitual. The action or deed\nthat led to the acquisition of a newly good habit must be persistently\nperformed in order to strengthen that habit; in this way,virtue (or,\ngood character) is acquired. Over time such an acquired virtue becomes\na habit. This is the position of Akan ethics on the development and\nacquisition of a good (or, bad) character, for this is what the Akan\npeople mean when they say aka ne ho, \u201cit has remained\nwith him,\u201d \u201cit has become part of him,\u201d \u201cit has\nbecome his habit.\u201d Character is, thus, a behavior pattern formed\nas a result of past persistent actions. Thus, moral virtues\n(excellences of character) or vices arise through habituation.\n\n\nThe logic of the acquisition of our character or habits is that the\noriginal nature of the human being was morally neutral, neither good\nnor bad. A person's original moral neutrality will in the course\nof his life come to be affected, in one direction (the good) or the\nother direction (the bad) by his actions and responses to moral\ninstruction, advice and persuasion. The original moral neutrality of a\nhuman being constitutes the foundation of our conception of the moral\nperson, for it makes for\u2014allows room for\u2014choice, that is, moral\nchoice. Consequently, what a person does or does not do is most crucial\nto the formation and development of his or her character, and, thus, to\nbecoming moral or immoral.\n",
