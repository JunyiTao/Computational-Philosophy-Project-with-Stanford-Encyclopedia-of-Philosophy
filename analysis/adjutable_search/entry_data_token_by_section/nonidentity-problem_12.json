    "main_text": "Proposed solutions to the nonidentity problem || Act is wrong in virtue of agent\u2019s reasons, attitudes and intentions\n4. Further challenges to the person-based intuition \n\nPart of the reason the person-based intuition has been so attractive\nis its good fit with what Jeff McMahan calls the Asymmetry\n(McMahan 1981; 2009). According to the Asymmetry, it is wrong (and\nmakes an outcome morally worse) to bring a miserable child\n\u2013 a child whose life is less than worth living \u2013\ninto existence but it is perfectly permissible (and does not make an\noutcome worse) to leave the happy child out of existence.\nWhile (arguably) leaving the happy child out of existence makes things\nworse for that child, the person-based intuition requires for\nwrongdoing not that things be made worse for a person who\nnever exists but rather that things be made worse for a\nperson who does or will exist.\n\nJan Narveson was an early advocate of both the person-based intuition\nand the Asymmetry. His defense of the Asymmetry, however, has been\nsubject to criticism by McMahan, Persson, Singer and Parfit. At this\njuncture, conceptual concerns about the Asymmetry have been just as\nimportant in leading philosophers to question the person-based\nintuition as the nonidentity problem has been.\n\nThe conceptual concerns arise when attempts are made to explain the\nAsymmetry by reference to principles that assign a special moral\nstatus to actual people (or people who will exist if the act under\nscrutiny is performed; or people who will exist independently of\nwhether that act is performed) that they do not also assign to merely\npossible people (or to never existing people; or to people whose\nexistence depends on that act being performed) (McMahan 1981; 2009;\nPersson 2009; Singer 2011, 114; Parfit 2011 vol. 2, 224\u2013225).\nSimilar concerns arise in connection with cases involving cycling, e.g., Parfit\u2019s Tom, Dick and Harry case. See Parfit 2017, 140\u2013146. See also Hare 2007, 503\u2013507 (discussion of double wrongful life; discussion of the Asymmetry).\n\nAn alternate defense of the Asymmetry avoids the claim that there is a\ncritical moral distinction to be drawn between classes of people\n(between, e.g., actual and merely possible people, or between people\nwho do or will exist at the world at which the act under scrutiny is\nperformed and people who will never exist at that world). On that\ndefense, we should instead distinguish, for any given person p\nin any such class, between p\u2019s being made worse off at a\ngiven world (compared to how well p fares at any alternate\nworld) where p does or will exist and p\u2019s\nbeing made worse off at one world (compared, again, to how well\np fares at any alternate world) where p never\nexists. And we should say that p\u2019s being made worse\noff in the former scenario has full moral significance while\np\u2019s being worse off in the latter has no moral\nsignificance at all. Then, even conceding that leaving the happy child\nout of existence makes that child worse off than that child might have\nbeen \u2013 even conceding, that is, that the happy child sustains a\n\u201closs\u201d or \u201charm\u201d when left out of existence\n\u2013 we can say that that loss does not count against the\nchoice to leave the happy child out of existence or in favor\nof the choice to bring that child into existence. In contrast,\nbringing the miserable child into an existence that is less than worth\nhaving has full moral significance. It counts, that is, against the\nchoice to bring that child into existence and in favor of the choice\nto leave that child out of existence. Why? Because the miserable child\nexists at the world where he or she sustains that loss (Roberts 2010,\n2011a, 2011b).\n",
