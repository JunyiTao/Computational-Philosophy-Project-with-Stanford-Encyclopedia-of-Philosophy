    "main_text": "Introduction || The Scriptural and Commentarial Tradition\n1.1 The Scriptural and Commentarial Tradition\n\nThe Pure Land teachings are often regarded as popularized, devotional\nextensions of a more philosophically demanding contemplative tradition\nbased on a core doctrine of emptiness or voidness. In fact, the\nconcepts of multitudes of celestial buddhas and their buddha-fields\nthroughout the cosmos are already in evidence in the earliest strata\nof extant texts produced by the Mahayana movement, and sutras\nexpounding distant buddha-fields, such as that of Ak\u1e63obhya\nBuddha in the east, are among the first to be translated into Chinese\nalready in the second century CE, with sutras teaching Amida Buddha\nsoon to follow. Thus, sutras teaching methods of achieving liberation\nfrom samsaric existence through attaining birth in buddha-fields in\nother regions of the cosmos\u2014particularly Amida Buddha\u2019s\nPure Land\u2014were among the earliest Buddhist scriptures\ntransmitted to China. Further, the teaching of birth into\nAmida\u2019s buddha-field became the focus of a continuous\ncommentarial tradition that began among such major Indian Mahayana\nthinkers as N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (c. 150\u2013250) and Vasubandhu (c.\n320\u2013400) in India, was transmitted to China as early as the\nthird century CE, and is maintained today in Japan. Thus, it may be\nsaid that Pure Land concepts and ideas emerged directly out of\nelemental strains of Mahayana Buddhist thought at an early stage and\nunderwent continual development in East Asia.\n\nThe Pure Land path based on Amida is expounded in the Larger\nand Smaller Sutras of the Adornments of [the Buddha-field\nNamed] Bliss\n(Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha-s\u016btra), which trace their\norigins back to northwestern India in about the first century CE, the\nperiod of the redaction of the\nPraj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 in 8000 Lines,\nGarland, Lotus, Vimalak\u012brti, and other\nmajor Mahayana sutras. These two sutras, along with the later\nSutra of Contemplation on the Buddha of Immeasurable Life\n(Jp. Kanmury\u014djuky\u014d), form the foundation for the\nEast Asian Pure Land tradition.\n\nThe Larger Sutra is the only extant sutra that relates the\nnarrative of how the bodhisattva Dharma-Storehouse (Dharm\u0101kara)\nestablished and fulfilled vows to become Amida (\u201cimmeasurable\n[light and life]\u201d), the buddha of compassion who leads all\nbeings to enlightenment by enabling them to be born into his\nbuddha-field. It was first translated into Chinese in the third\ncentury and was reputedly retranslated eleven more times over the\nfollowing seven hundred years, attesting to its enduring importance in\nChinese Buddhist tradition. The Pure Land tradition developed for over\na thousand years in China, accumulating an extensive body of\nscriptural and commentarial writings, before undergoing the radical\nreinterpretation in Japan that Suzuki refers to.\n\nThus, the Pure Land Buddhist heritage in Japan stands today upon the\nselective use of a continuous textual tradition stretching back nearly\ntwo millennia. Terms from the Chinese of the sutras in their various\nrenditions and evolving commentaries on the Pure Land path became the\nstandard medium of Pure Land Buddhist discourse in Japan, so that a\nfull grasp of the Japanese tradition requires familiarity with these\nterms, their relationship to the broader Buddhist tradition, and the\nhistorical changes in their understandings and emphases in the course\nof their long development in various cultural spheres and sectarian\nsettings. Japanese Buddhists have been, throughout their history,\nfully aware of their geographical position at the easternmost reach of\nthe spread of Buddhism in Asia and of their indebtedness to the\ntransmission of Buddhist tradition across the various ethnic locales\nand political boundaries of the Asian continent.\n",
