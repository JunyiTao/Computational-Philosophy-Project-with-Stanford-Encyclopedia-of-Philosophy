    "main_text": "Knowledge and Belief || The \u2018Third Dogma\u2019 of Empiricism\n4.3 The \u2018Third Dogma\u2019 of Empiricism\n\nDavidson\u2019s rejection of the idea of an untranslatable language\n(and the associated idea, also common to many forms of conceptual\nrelativism, of a radically different, and so\n\u2018incommensurable\u2019 system of belief) is part of a more\ngeneral argument that he advances (notably in \u2018On the Very Idea\nof a Conceptual Scheme\u2019) against the so-called \u2018third\ndogma\u2019 of empiricism. The first two dogmas are those famously\nidentified by Quine in \u2018Two Dogmas of Empiricism\u2019 (first\npublished in the Philosophical Review, in 1951). The first is\nthat of reductionism (the idea that, for any meaningful statement, it\ncan be recast in the language of pure sensory experience, or, at\nleast, in terms of a set of confirmatory instances), while the second\nis the analytic-synthetic distinction (the idea that, with respect to\nall meaningful statements, one can distinguish between statements that\nare true in virtue of their meaning and those that are true in virtue\nof both their meanings and some fact or facts about the world). The\nrejection of both these dogmas can be seen as an important element\nthroughout Davidson\u2019s thinking. The third dogma, which Davidson\nclaims can still be discerned in Quine\u2019s work (and so can\nsurvive the rejection even of the analytic-synthetic distinction),\nconsists in the idea that one can distinguish within knowledge or\nexperience between a conceptual component (the \u2018conceptual\nscheme\u2019) and an empirical component (the \u2018empirical\ncontent\u2019) \u2013 the former is often taken to derive from\nlanguage and the later from experience, nature or some form of\n\u2018sensory input\u2019. While there are difficulties in even\narriving at a clear formulation of this distinction (particularly so\nfar as the nature of the relation between the two components is\nconcerned), such a distinction depends on being able to distinguish,\nat some basic level, between a \u2018subjective\u2019 contribution\nto knowledge that comes from us and an \u2018objective\u2019\ncontribution that comes from the world. What the Davidsonian account\nof knowledge and interpretation demonstrates, however, is that no such\ndistinction can be drawn. Attitudes are already interconnected with\nobjects and events in the world (causally, semantically and\nepistemically), whilst knowledge of self and others already\npresupposes knowledge of the world. The very idea of a conceptual\nscheme is thus rejected by Davidson along with the idea of any strong\nform of conceptual relativism. To possess attitudes and be capable of\nspeech is already to be capable of interpreting others and to be open\nto interpretation by them.\n",
