Why did creatures with qualia survive rather than\nthose creatures\u2019 zombie counterparts? If zombies could have\nsurvived, what\u2019s the use of consciousness? Owen Flanagan and\nThomas Polger have used the apparent possibility of zombies to support\nthe claim that \u2018There are as yet no credible stories about why\nsubjects of experience emerged, why they might have won \u2014 or\nshould have been expected to win \u2014 an evolutionary battle\nagainst very intelligent zombie-like information-sensitive\norganisms\u2019 (1995, 321): a problem not faced by those who reject\nthe possibility of zombies. One response on behalf of those who do\naccept it is to suggest that there might be fundamental laws linking\nthe phenomenal to the physical. Such laws would not depend on whether\nconscious creatures ever happened to evolve, in which case, arguably,\nevolution raises no special problem (Chalmers 1996, 171) \u2014\nalthough the existence of such laws would pose its own problems.\n",
