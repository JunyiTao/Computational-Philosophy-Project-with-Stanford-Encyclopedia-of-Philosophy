    "main_text": "\n\nHerbert Feigl was an Austrian-born logical empiricist philosopher who\npublished the main part of his writings after his emigration to the\nUnited States in 1931. To a large extent inspired by the writings of\nhis academic teacher Moritz Schlick, Feigl delivered important\ncontributions to the philosophical analysis of probability, to the\ndebate over scientific realism, and to the analysis of the mind-body\nproblem. His overarching aim was to inform established philosophical\nanalysis by what he called the \u201cscientific attitude.\u201d\n",
