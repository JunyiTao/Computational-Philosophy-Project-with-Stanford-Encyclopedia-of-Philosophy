    "main_text": "The Human Good and the Function Argument\n2. The Human Good and the Function Argument\n\nThe principal idea with which Aristotle begins is that there are\ndifferences of opinion about what is best for human beings, and that\nto profit from ethical inquiry we must resolve this disagreement. He\ninsists that ethics is not a theoretical discipline: we are asking\nwhat the good for human beings is not simply because we want to have\nknowledge, but because we will be better able to achieve our good if\nwe develop a fuller understanding of what it is to flourish. In\nraising this question\u2014what is the good?\u2014Aristotle is not\nlooking for a list of items that are good. He assumes that such a list\ncan be compiled rather easily; most would agree, for example, that it\nis good to have friends, to experience pleasure, to be healthy, to be\nhonored, and to have such virtues as courage at least to some degree.\nThe difficult and controversial question arises when we ask whether\ncertain of these goods are more desirable than others.\nAristotle\u2019s search for the good is a search for the\nhighest good, and he assumes that the highest good, whatever\nit turns out to be, has three characteristics: it is desirable for\nitself, it is not desirable for the sake of some other good, and all\nother goods are desirable for its sake.\n\nAristotle thinks everyone will agree that the terms\n\u201ceudaimonia\u201d (\u201chappiness\u201d) and\n\u201ceu z\u00ean\u201d (\u201cliving well\u201d)\ndesignate such an end. The Greek term \u201ceudaimon\u201d\nis composed of two parts: \u201ceu\u201d means\n\u201cwell\u201d and \u201cdaimon\u201d means\n\u201cdivinity\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d. To be\neudaimon is therefore to be living in a way that is\nwell-favored by a god. But Aristotle never calls attention to this\netymology in his ethical writings, and it seems to have little\ninfluence on his thinking. He regards \u201ceudaimon\u201d\nas a mere substitute for eu z\u00ean (\u201cliving\nwell\u201d). These terms play an evaluative role, and are not simply\ndescriptions of someone\u2019s state of mind.\n\nNo one tries to live well for the sake of some further goal; rather,\nbeing eudaimon is the highest end, and all\nsubordinate goals\u2014health, wealth, and other such\nresources\u2014are sought because they promote well-being, not\nbecause they are what well-being consists in. But unless we can\ndetermine which good or goods happiness consists in, it is of little\nuse to acknowledge that it is the highest end. To resolve this issue,\nAristotle asks what the ergon (\u201cfunction\u201d,\n\u201ctask\u201d, \u201cwork\u201d) of a human being is, and\nargues that it consists in activity of the rational part of the soul\nin accordance with virtue (1097b22\u20131098a20). One important\ncomponent of this argument is expressed in terms of distinctions he\nmakes in his psychological and biological works. The soul is analyzed\ninto a connected series of capacities: the nutritive soul is\nresponsible for growth and reproduction, the locomotive soul for\nmotion, the perceptive soul for perception, and so on. The biological\nfact Aristotle makes use of is that human beings are the only species\nthat has not only these lower capacities but a rational soul as well.\nThe good of a human being must have something to do with being human;\nand what sets humanity off from other species, giving us the potential\nto live a better life, is our capacity to guide ourselves by using\nreason. If we use reason well, we live well as human beings; or, to be\nmore precise, using reason well over the course of a full life is what\nhappiness consists in. Doing anything well requires virtue or\nexcellence, and therefore living well consists in activities caused by\nthe rational soul in accordance with virtue or excellence.\n\nAristotle\u2019s conclusion about the nature of happiness is in a\nsense uniquely his own. No other writer or thinker had said precisely\nwhat he says about what it is to live well. But at the same time his\nview is not too distant from a common idea. As he himself points out,\none traditional conception of happiness identifies it with virtue\n(1098b30\u20131). Aristotle\u2019s theory should be construed as a\nrefinement of this position. He says, not that happiness is virtue,\nbut that it is virtuous activity. Living well consists in\ndoing something, not just being in a certain state or condition. It\nconsists in those lifelong activities that actualize the virtues of\nthe rational part of the soul.\n\nAt the same time, Aristotle makes it clear that in order to be happy\none must possess others goods as well\u2014such goods as friends,\nwealth, and power. And one\u2019s happiness is endangered if one is\nseverely lacking in certain advantages\u2014if, for example, one is\nextremely ugly, or has lost children or good friends through death\n(1099a31\u2013b6). But why so? If one\u2019s ultimate end should\nsimply be virtuous activity, then why should it make any difference to\none\u2019s happiness whether one has or lacks these other types of\ngood? Aristotle\u2019s reply is that one\u2019s virtuous activity\nwill be to some extent diminished or defective, if one lacks an\nadequate supply of other goods (1153b17\u201319). Someone who is\nfriendless, childless, powerless, weak, and ugly will simply not be\nable to find many opportunities for virtuous activity over a long\nperiod of time, and what little he can accomplish will not be of great\nmerit. To some extent, then, living well requires good fortune;\nhappenstance can rob even the most excellent human beings of\nhappiness. Nonetheless, Aristotle insists, the highest good, virtuous\nactivity, is not something that comes to us by chance. Although we\nmust be fortunate enough to have parents and fellow citizens who help\nus become virtuous, we ourselves share much of the responsibility for\nacquiring and exercising the virtues.\n",
