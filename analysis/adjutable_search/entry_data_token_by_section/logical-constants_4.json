    "main_text": "Permutation invariance\n5. Permutation invariance\n\n\nA number of philosophers have suggested that what is distinctive of\nlogical constants is their insensitivity to the particular identities\nof objects, or, more precisely, their invariance under\narbitrary permutations of the domain of objects (Mautner 1946;\nMostowski 1957, 13; Scott 1970, 160\u2013161; McCarthy 1981, 1987; Tarski\n1986; van Benthem 1989; Sher 1991, 1996; McGee 1996).\n\n\nLet us unpack that phrase a bit. A permutation of a\ncollection of objects is a one-one mapping from that collection onto\nitself. Each object gets mapped to an object in the collection\n(possibly itself), and no two objects are mapped to the same object.\nFor example, the following mapping is a permutation of the first five\nletters of the alphabet:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\textrm{A} &\\Rightarrow \\textrm{C} \\\\\n\\textrm{B} &\\Rightarrow \\textrm{B} \\\\\n\\textrm{C} &\\Rightarrow \\textrm{E} \\\\\n\\textrm{D} &\\Rightarrow \\textrm{A} \\\\\n\\textrm{E} &\\Rightarrow \\textrm{D} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nAnd the function \\(f(x) = x + 1\\) is a\npermutation of the set of integers onto itself. (Note, however, that a\npermutation need not be specifiable either by enumeration, as in our\nfirst example, or by a rule, as in our second.)\n\nThe extension of a predicate is invariant under a permutation of the domain if\nreplacing each of its members with the object to\nwhich the permutation maps it leaves us with the same set we\nstarted with.  Thus, for example, the extension of \u201cis a\nletter between \\(\\textrm{A}\\) and \\(\\textrm{E}\\)\u201d is invariant under the permutation of\nletters described above. By contrast, the\nextension of \u201cis a vowel between \\(\\textrm{A}\\) and \\(\\textrm{E}\\)\u201d,\nthe set \\(\\{\\textrm{A}, \\textrm{E}\\}\\),\nis not invariant under this permutation, which transforms it\nto a different set, \\(\\{\\textrm{C}, \\textrm{D}\\}\\).\n\n\nWe can make the notion of permutation invariance more precise\nas follows. Given a permutation \\(p\\) of objects on a domain \\(D\\),\nwe define a transformation \\(p^*\\) of\narbitrary types in the hierarchy:\n\nif \\(x\\) is an object in \\(D\\), \\(p^*(x) = p(x)\\).\nif \\(x\\) is a set, then \\(p^*(x) =\n\\{ y : \\exists z (z \\in x \\and y = p^*(z))\\}\\)\n(that is, the set of objects to which\n\\(p^*\\) maps members of \\(x\\)).\nif \\(x\\) is an ordered \\(n\\)-tuple\n\\(\\langle x_1, \\dots, x_n \\rangle\\), then\n\\(p^*(x) = \\langle p^*(x_1), \\dots, p^*(x_n) \\rangle\\)\n(that is, the \\(n\\)-tuple of objects to which \\(p^*\\) maps\n\\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\)).[9]\n\n\n\nThese clauses can be applied recursively to define\ntransformations of sets of ordered tuples in \\(D\\) (the extensions\nof two-place predicates), sets\nof sets of objects in \\(D\\) (the extensions of unary first-order quantifiers),\nand so on. (For an introduction to\nthe type theoretic hierachy, see\nthe entry on Type Theory.) Where \\(x\\) is an\nitem in this hierarchy, we say that \\(x\\) is invariant\nunder a permutation \\(p\\) just in case \\(p^*(x) = x\\).\nTo return to our example above, the set \n\\(\\{\\textrm{A}, \\textrm{B}, \\textrm{C}, \\textrm{D}, \\textrm{E}\\}\\) is\ninvariant under all permutations of the letters \\(\\textrm{A}\\) through \\(\\textrm{E}\\):\nno matter how we switch these letters around, we end up with the same\nset.  But it is not invariant under all permutations of the entire\nalphabet.  For example, the permutation that switches the letters \\(\\textrm{A}\\)\nand \\(\\textrm{Z}\\), mapping all the other letters to themselves, transforms \n\\(\\{\\textrm{A}, \\textrm{B}, \\textrm{C}, \\textrm{D}, \\textrm{E}\\}\\) to \n\\(\\{\\textrm{Z}, \\textrm{B}, \\textrm{C}, \\textrm{D}, \\textrm{E}\\}\\).  The set containing all the letters,\nhowever, is invariant under all permutations of letters.  So is\nthe set of all sets containing at least two letters, and the relation\nof identity, which holds between each letter and itself.\n\n\nSo far we have defined permutation invariance for objects, tuples,\nand sets, but not for predicates, quantifiers, or other linguistic\nexpressions. But it is the latter, not the former, that we need to sort\ninto logical and nonlogical constants. The natural thought is that an\nexpression should count as permutation-invariant just in case its\nextension on each domain of objects is invariant under all permutations\nof that domain. (As usual, the extension of a name on a domain is the\nobject it denotes, the extension of a monadic predicate is the set of\nobjects in the domain to which it applies, and the extension of an\n\\(n\\)-adic predicate is the set of \\(n\\)-tuples of objects in\nthe domain to which it applies.) As it stands, this definition does not\napply to sentential connectives, which do not have\nextensions in the usual\n sense,[10]\n but it can be extended to cover them in a natural way (following\nMcGee 1996, 569). We can think of the semantic value of an \\(n\\)-ary\nquantifier or sentential connective \\(C\\) on a domain \\(D\\)\nas a function from \\(n\\)-tuples of sets of assignments (of values\nfrom \\(D\\) to the language\u2019s variables) to sets of\nassignments. Where the input to the function is the \\(n\\)-tuple\nof sets of assignments that satisfy \\(\\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_n\\),\nits output is the set of assignments\nthat satisfies \\(C\\phi_1 \\dots \\phi_n\\).\n(Check your understanding by thinking about how this works for\nthe unary connective \\(\\exists x\\).)\nWe can then define permutation\ninvariance for these semantic values as follows. Where \\(A\\) is a\nset of assignments and \\(p\\) is a permutation of a domain \\(D\\), let\n\\(p^\\dagger(A) = \\{ p \\circ a : a \\in\nA\\}\\).[11]\n Then if \\(e\\) is the semantic value of an \\(n\\)-place\nconnective or quantifier (in the sense defined above), \\(e\\) is\ninvariant under a permutation \\(p\\) just in case for any\n\\(n\\)-tuple \\(\\langle A_1, \\dots, A_n \\rangle\\) of\nsets of assignments, \\(p^\\dagger (e(\\langle A_1, \\dots, A_n\\rangle)) =\ne(\\langle p^\\dagger (A_1), \\dots, p^\\dagger (A_n)\\rangle\\)).\nAnd a connective or quantifier\nis permutation-invariant just in case its semantic value on each domain of\nobjects is invariant under all permutations of that domain.\n\n\nIt turns out that this condition does not quite suffice to weed out\nall sensitivity to particular features of objects, for it\nallows that a permutation-invariant constant might behave differently\non domains containing different kinds of objects. McGee (1996, 575)\ngives the delightful example of wombat disjunction, which\nbehaves like disjunction if the domain contains wombats and like\nconjunction otherwise. Sher\u2019s fix, and McGee\u2019s, is to consider not just\npermutations\u2014bijections of the domain onto itself\u2014but\narbitrary bijections of the domain onto another domain of equal\n cardinality.[12]\n For simplicity, we will ignore this\ncomplication in what follows and continue to talk of permutations.\n\n\nWhich expressions get counted as logical constants, on this\ncriterion? The monadic predicates \u201cis a thing\u201d (which applies to\neverything) and \u201cis not anything\u201d (which applies to nothing), the\nidentity predicate, the truth-functional connectives, and the standard\nexistential and universal quantifiers all pass the test. So do the\nstandard first-order binary quantifiers like \u201cmost\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d (see\n the entry on \n descriptions).\n Indeed, because cardinality is permutation-invariant, every\ncardinality quantifier is included, including \u201cthere are infinitely\nmany\u201d, \u201cthere are uncountably many\u201d, and others that are not\nfirst-order definable. Moreover, the second-order quantifiers count as\nlogical (at least on the standard semantics, in which they range over\narbitrary subsets of the domain), as do all higher-order\nquantifiers. On the other hand, all proper names are excluded, as are\nthe predicates \u201cred\u201d, \u201chorse\u201d, \u201cis a successor of\u201d, and \u201cis a member\nof\u201d, as well as the quantifiers \u201csome dogs\u201d and \u201cexactly two natural\nnumbers\u201d. So the invariance criterion seems to accord at least\npartially with common intuitions about logicality or topic neutrality,\nand with our logical practice. Two technical results allow us to be a\nbit more precise about the extent of this accord: Lindenbaum and\nTarski (1934\u20135) show that all of the relations definable in the\nlanguage of Principia Mathematica are\npermutation-invariant. Moving in the other direction, McGee (1996)\nshows that every permutation-invariant operation can be defined in\nterms of operations with an intuitively logical character (identity,\nsubstitution of variables, finite or infinite disjunction, negation,\nand finite or infinite existential quantification). He also\ngeneralizes the Lindenbaum-Tarski result by showing that every\noperation so definable is permutation invariant.\n\n\nAs Tarski and others have pointed out, the permutation invariance\ncriterion for logical constants can be seen as a natural generalization\nof Felix Klein\u2019s (1893) idea that different geometries can be\ndistinguished by the groups of transformations under which their basic\nnotions are invariant. Thus, for example, the notions of Euclidean\ngeometry are invariant under similarity transformations, those of\naffine geometry under affine transformations, and those of topology\nunder bicontinuous transformations. In the same way, Tarski suggests\n(1986, 149), the logical notions are just those that are\ninvariant under the widest possible group of transformations: the group\nof permutations of the elements in the domain. Seen in this\nway, the logical notions are the end point of a chain of progressively\nmore abstract, \u201cformal,\u201d or topic-neutral notions defined by their\ninvariance under progressively wider groups of transformations of a\ndomain.[13]\n\n\nAs an account of the distinctive generality of logic, then,\npermutation invariance has much to recommend it. It is philosophically\nwell-motivated and mathematically precise, it yields results that\naccord with common practice, and it gives determinate rulings about\nsome borderline cases (for example, set-theoretic membership). Best of\nall, it offers hope for a sharp and principled demarcation of logic\nthat avoids cloudy epistemic and semantic terms like \u201cabout\u201d,\n\u201canalytic\u201d, and \u201ca\n priori\u201d.[14]\n\n\nA limitation of the permutation invariance criterion (as it has been\nstated so far) is that it applies only to extensional operators and\nconnectives. It is therefore of no help in deciding, for instance,\nwhether the necessity operator in S4 modal logic or the H\noperator (\u201cit has\nalways been the case that\u201d) in temporal logic are bona\nfide logical constants, and these are among the questions that we\nwanted a criterion to resolve. However, the invariance criterion can be\nextended in a natural way to intensional operators. The usual strategy\nfor handling such operators semantically is to relativize truth not\njust to an assignment of values to variables, but also to a possible\nworld and a time. In such a framework, one might demand that logical\nconstants be insensitive not just to permutations of the domain of\nobjects, but to permutations of the domain of possible worlds and the\ndomain of times (see Scott 1970, 161, McCarthy 1981, 511\u201313, van\nBenthem 1989, 334). The resulting criterion is fairly stringent: it\ncounts the S5 necessity operator as a logical constant, but not the S4\nnecessity operator or the H operator in temporal logic.\nThe reason is that the latter two operators are sensitive to\nstructure on the domains of worlds and\ntimes\u2014the \u201caccessibility relation\u201d in the former case, the\nrelation of temporal ordering in the latter\u2014and this structure is\nnot preserved by all permutations of these\n domains.[15]\n (See the entries on \n modal logic\n and\n temporal logic.)\n\n\nOne might avoid this consequence by requiring only invariance under\npermutations that preserve the relevant structure on these domains\n(accessibility relations, temporal ordering). But one would then be\nfaced with the task of explaining why this structure deserves\nspecial treatment (cf. van Benthem 1989, 334). And if we are allowed to\nkeep some structure on the domain of worlds or times fixed, the\nquestion immediately arises why we should not also keep some structure\non the domain of objects fixed: for example, the set-theoretic\nmembership relation, the mereological part/whole relation, or the\ndistinction between existent and nonexistent objects (see the\nentry on free logics).\nWhatever resources we appeal to in answering this question\nwill be doing at least as much work as permutation invariance in the\nresulting demarcation of logical constants.\n\n\nIt may seem that the only principled position is to demand\ninvariance under all permutations. But even that position\nneeds justification, especially when one sees that it is possible to\nformulate even stricter invariance conditions. Feferman (1999) defines\na \u201csimilarity invariance\u201d criterion that counts the truth-functional\noperators and first-order existential and universal quantifiers as\nlogical constants, but not identity, the first-order cardinality\nquantifiers, or the second-order quantifiers. Feferman\u2019s criterion\ndraws the line between logic and mathematics much closer to the\ntraditional boundary than the permutation invariance criterion does.\nIndeed, one of Feferman\u2019s criticisms of the permutation invariance\ncriterion is that it allows too many properly mathematical notions to\nbe expressed in purely logical terms.  Bonnay (2008) argues for\na different criterion, invariance under potential isomorphism, which\ncounts finite cardinality quantifiers and the notion of finiteness as\nlogical, while excluding the higher cardinality\nquantifiers\u2014thus \u201c[setting] the boundary between\nlogic and mathematics somewhere between arithmetic and set theory\u201d\n(37; see Feferman 2010, \u00a76, for further discussion).\nFeferman (2010) suggests that instead of relying solely\non invariance, we might combine invariance under permutations\nwith a separate absoluteness requirement, which captures the\ninsensitivity of logic to controversial set-theoretic theses like\naxioms of infinity.  He shows that the logical operations that\nare both permutation-invariant and absolutely definable\nwith respect to Kripke\u2013Platek set theory without an\naxiom of infinity are just those definable in first-order logic.\n\n\n\nThere is another problem that afflicts any attempt to demarcate the\nlogical constants by appeal to mathematical properties like invariance.\nAs McCarthy puts it: \u201cthe logical status of an expression is not\nsettled by the functions it introduces, independently of how these\nfunctions are specified\u201d (1981, 516). Consider a two-place\npredicate \\(\\dq{\\approx}\\), whose meaning is given by the following\ndefinition:\n\n\\[\n\\cq{\\alpha \\approx \\beta }\\text{ is true on an\nassignment } a \\text{ just in case }\\\\\na(\\alpha) \\text{ and } a(\\beta) \\text{ have exactly the same mass.}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAccording to the invariance criterion, \\(\\dq{\\approx}\\) is a logical\nconstant just in case its extension on every domain is invariant under\nevery permutation of that domain. On a domain \\(D\\) containing no\ntwo objects with exactly the same mass, \\(\\dq{\\approx}\\) has the same\nextension as \\(\\dq{=}\\)\u2014the set \\(\\{ \\langle x, x \\rangle :\nx \\in D\\}\\)\u2014and as we have seen, this extension\nis invariant under every permutation of the domain. Hence, if there is\nno domain containing two objects with exactly the same mass,\n\\(\\dq{\\approx}\\) counts as a logical constant, and\n\\(\\dq{\\forall x (x \\approx x)}\\) as a logical\ntruth.[16]\nBut it\nseems odd that the logical status of \\(\\dq{\\approx}\\) and\n\\(\\dq{\\forall x (x \\approx x)}\\) should depend on a matter of\ncontingent fact: whether there are distinct objects with identical\nmass. Do we really want to say that if we lived in a world in which no\ntwo objects had the same mass, \\(\\dq{\\approx}\\) would be a logical\n constant?[17]\n\n\nA natural response to this kind of objection would be to require\nthat the extension of a logical constant on every possible\ndomain of objects be invariant under every permutation of that domain,\nor, more generally, that a logical constant satisfy the permutation\ninvariance criterion as a matter of necessity. But this would\nnot get to the root of the problem. For consider the unary connective\n\\(\\dq{\\#}\\), defined by the clause\n\n\\[\n\\cq{\\#\\phi}~\\text{is true on an assignment } a \\text{ just in case }\\\\\n\\phi \\text{ is not true on } a \\text { and water is } H_{2}O.\n\\]\n\n\nAssuming that Kripke (1971; 1980) is right that water is necessarily\nH2O,\n\\(\\dq{\\#}\\) has the same extension as\n\\(\\dq{\\neg}\\) in every possible world, and so satisfies the permutation\ninvariance criterion as a matter of necessity (McGee 1996, 578). But intuitively, it does\nnot seem that \\(\\dq{\\#}\\) should be counted a logical\n constant.[18]\n\n\nOne might evade this counterexample by appealing to an\nepistemic modality instead of a metaphysical one. This is\nMcCarthy\u2019s strategy (1987, 439). Even if it is metaphysically necessary\nthat water is H2O, there are\npresumably epistemically possible worlds, or information states, in\nwhich water is not H2O. So if we\nrequire that a logical constant be permutation invariant as a matter of\nepistemic necessity (or a priori), \\(\\dq{\\#}\\) does not count as a\nlogical constant. But even on this version of the criterion, a\nconnective like \\(\\dq{\\%}\\), defined by\n\n\\[\n\\cq{\\%\\phi}~\\text{is true on an assignment } a \\text{ just in case }\\\\\n\\phi \\text { is not true on } a \\text{ and there are no male widows.}\n\\]\n\n\nwould count as a logical constant (G\u00f3mez-Torrente\n2002, 21), assuming that it is epistemically necessary that there are\nno male widows. It may be tempting to solve this problem by\nappealing to a distinctively logical modality\u2014requiring,\nfor example, that logical constants have permutation-invariant\nextensions as a matter of logical necessity. But we would then\nbe explicating the notion of a logical constant in terms of an obscure\nprimitive notion of logical necessity which we could not, on pain of\ncircularity, explicate by reference to logical constants. (McCarthy\n1998, \u00a73 appeals explicitly to logical possibility and notices the\nthreat of circularity here.)\n\n\nMcGee\u2019s strategy is to invoke semantic notions instead of modal\nones: he suggests that \u201c[a] connective is a logical connective if and\nonly if it follows from the meaning of the connective that it is\ninvariant under arbitrary bijections\u201d (McGee 1996, 578). But this\napproach, like McCarthy\u2019s, seems to count \\(\\dq{\\%}\\) as a logical constant.\nAnd, like McCarthy\u2019s, it requires appeal to a notion that does not seem\nany clearer than the notion of a logical constant: the notion of\nfollowing (logically?) from the meaning of the connective.\n\n\nSher\u2019s response to the objection is radically different from McGee\u2019s\nor McCarthy\u2019s. She suggests that \u201clogical terms are identified with\ntheir (actual) extensions,\u201d so that \\(\\dq{\\#}\\), \\(\\dq{\\%}\\),\nand \\(\\dq{\\neg}\\) are just\ndifferent notations for the same term. More precisely: if these\nexpressions are used the way a logical constant must be used\u2014as\nrigid\n designators[19]\n of their semantic values\u2014then they can be identified with the\noperation of Boolean negation and hence with each other. \u201cQua\nquantifiers, \u2018the number of planets\u2019 and \u20189\u2019 are\nindistinguishable\u201d (Sher 1991, 64). But it is not clear what Sher can\nmean when she says that logical terms can be identified with their\nextensions. We normally individuate connectives\nintentionally, by the conditions for grasping them or the\nrules for their use, and not by the truth functions they express. For\nexample, we recognize a difference between \\(\\dq{\\and}\\), defined by\n\n\n\\[\n\\cq{\\phi \\and \\psi } \\text{ is true on an assignment \\(a\\) just in case}\\\\\n\\phi \\text{ is true on \\(a\\) and \\(\\psi\\) is true on \\(a\\)},\n\\]\n\nand \\(\\dq{@}\\), defined by\n\n\\[\n\\cq{\\phi\\ @\\ \\psi } \\text{ is true on an assignment \\(a\\) just in case}\\\\\n\\text{it is not the case either that \\(\\phi\\) is not true on \\(a\\)}\\\\\n\\text{or that \\(\\psi\\) is not true on \\(a\\)},\n\\]\n\n\neven though they express the same truth function. The distinction\nbetween these terms is not erased, as Sher seems to suggest, if we use\nthem as rigid designators for the truth functions they express. (That\n\u201cHesperus\u201d, \u201cPhosphorus\u201d, and \u201cthe planet\nI actually saw near the horizon on the morning of November 1, 2004\u201d\nall rigidly designate Venus\ndoes not entail that they have the same meaning.)\nThus Sher\u2019s proposal can only be\nunderstood as a stipulation that if one of a pair of\ncoreferential rigid designators counts as a logical constant, the other\ndoes too. But it is not clear why we should accept this stipulation. It\ncertainly has some counterintuitive consequences: for example, that\n\\(\\dq{P \\vee \\#P}\\) is a logical\ntruth, at least when \\(\\dq{\\#}\\) is used rigidly (see G\u00f3mez-Torrente\n2002, 19, and the response in Sher 2003).\n\n\nIt is hard not to conclude from these discussions that the\npermutation invariance criterion gives at best a necessary condition\nfor logical constancy. Its main shortcoming is that it operates at the\nlevel of reference rather than the level of sense; it looks at the\nlogical operations expressed by the constants, but not at their\nmeanings. An adequate criterion, one might therefore expect, would\noperate at the level of sense, perhaps attending to the way we\ngrasp the meanings of logical constants.\n",
