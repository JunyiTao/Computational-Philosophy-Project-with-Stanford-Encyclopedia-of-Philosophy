    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || Du Bois\u2019s Political Thought After The Souls of Black Folk\n4.2 Du Bois\u2019s Political Thought After The Souls of Black Folk\n\nAs Lawrie Balfour has argued, Du Bois wrote \u201cprolifically\u201d\non a broad array of topics, so that his writings can usefully be read\nas an extended series of essayistic, experimental efforts to address\nthe various issues that engaged him (2011, 17\u201318). The reception\nof Du Bois by contemporary political theorists attests to the\nextraordinary, topical scope of his political thought, especially as\nit evolved after the publication of Souls.\n4.2.1 Du Bois\u2019s Elitism\n\nIn several post-Souls writings, Du Bois returns to the theme\nof black political leadership. In Dusk of Dawn, for example,\nhe reaffirms his belief that \u201cthe Talented Tenth\u201d should\ndetermine \u201cthe present field and demand for racial action and\nthe method by which the masses may be guided along this line\u201d\n(1940, 159). And several years later, after critically reflecting on\nhis earlier thinking about group leadership, he proposes a \u201cnew\nidea for a Talented Tenth\u201d (1948, 168). Whether or not Du Bois\nultimately rejected his earlier conception of elite black leadership\n(Du Bois, 1903b) is an issue of scholarly dispute. Joy James holds\nthat Du Bois eventually repudiates the idea of a black intelligentsia\nvanguard (James, 1997). Cornel West contends that Du Bois\u2019s\nlater revisions of his concept of the talented tenth were\n\u201cpiecemeal\u201d (West, 1996, 71). Adolph Reed, by way of a\nmeticulous reading of Du Bois\u2019s later writings and speeches,\nargues that Du Bois advanced an elite-centered notion of black\npolitics throughout his intellectual and activist career (Reed, 1997).\nTommie Shelby and Paul Taylor provide especially nuanced\nreconstructions of Du Bois\u2019s evolving understanding of black\npolitical leadership (Shelby, 2007, chapter 2; Taylor, 2010,\n907\u2013910.). More recently, Arash Davari has thoughtfully taken\nissue with both Reed and Gooding-Williams, arguing that, already in\nSouls and The Philadelphia Negro (1899), Du Bois\nestablishes the basis for non-elitist conception of democratic\npolitical leadership (Davari, 2018).\n4.2.2 Marx, Du Bois, and Black Radicalism\n\nAn important and still underappreciated strand of Du Bois\u2019s\npost-Souls political thought is his engagement with Marxist\nsocial and political theory. The key text here is Black\nReconstruction (1935), Du Bois\u2019s monumental critique of the\nDunning School\u2019s interpretation of\n Reconstruction.[38]\n Like Joel Olson (2004; see 2.2.4.3 above), Cedric Robinson (1983) and\nAnthony Bogues (2003) have argued that Black Reconstruction\nshould be read as historical and political theory, not simply as\nrevisionist historiography. On Robinson\u2019s reading, Du Bois\ndeveloped \u201ca theory of history, which by its emphasis on mass\naction was both a critique of the ideologies of American socialist\nmovements and a revision of Marx\u2019s theory of revolution and\nclass struggle\u201d (Robinson, 277). Bogues agrees that Du Bois\nbreaks with Marx and Marxist orthodoxy, and adds that, like other\nblack radical theorists, Du Bois reorients the radical critique of\nmodernity away from \u201cissues of political obligation, sovereign\nself and citizenship\u2026to questions of domination, oppression,\nand politics as a practice of freedom\u201d (Bogues, 93). Building on\nDu Bois and on Robinson\u2019s engagement with Du Bois, the\nhistorian, Walter Johnson (2016) has argued that the history of\nslavery and racial capitalism provides a standpoint from which\n\u201cto rethink our idea of justice\u201d (Johnson, 29). Although\nhe gives scant attention to Black Reconstruction in\npartiular, Charles Mills has made a strong case for categorizing Du\nBois as a \u201cblack radical liberal,\u201d where black radical\nliberalism \u201cis a liberalism informed by the realities of\nracial capitalism and self-consciously oriented accordingly\nby the need to rethink white liberal theory in the light\u201d\n(Mills, 2018, 32).\n\nThe most illuminating recent discussions of Black\nReconstruction\u2019s theoretical engagement with the Marxist\ntradition focus on particular chapters of Du Bois\u2019s magnum\nopus, including Gayatri Spivak\u2019s consideration of Du\nBois\u2019s idea of the general strike in connection to \u201cthe\nEuropean phenomenon of the general strike and its use by\nMarxism\u201d (Spivak, 2014, pp.9, 13; Du Bois, 1935, chapter 4);\nAllison Power\u2019s argument that Du Bois adapts Marx\u2019s\nnotions of transsubstantiation and commodity fetishism to analyze the\ntragedy of the life of Andrew Johnson as well as regressive\ninterpretations of the American Constitution as embodying eternal,\nimmutable law (Powers, 2014; Du Bois, 1935, chapters 8 and 9); and,\nfinally, Andrew Douglas\u2019s proposal that Du Bois develops a\npolitical theory of racial capitalism that prioritizes\npolitics over both economics and ethics (Douglas, 2019; Du Bois, 1935,\nchapters 7 and 14).\n4.2.3 Feminist Theory and Du Bois\n\nFeminist theorists\u2019 appraisals of Du Bois\u2019s political\nthought have been mixed, ranging from criticisms of his masculinist\nfailure to regard black women as intellectuals and race leaders (e.g.\nCarby, 1998 and James, 1997) to praise for his advocacy of\nwomen\u2019s equality and his contributions to our understanding of\nthe oppression of black women (e.g., James, 1997 and Griffin,\n2000).\n\nFeminist theorists\u2019 commentary on Du Bois\u2019s political\nthought has tended to concentrate on chapter 7 of Darkwater\n(1920), \u201cThe Damnation of Women.\u201d Women are damned, Du\nBois proposes, for \u201conly at the sacrifice of intelligence and\nthe chance to do their best work can the majority of women bear\nchildren\u201d (1920, 78\u201379). While Farah Griffin interprets\n\u201cDamnation\u201d in the perspective of a still persistent\n\u201cpolitics of protection\u201d that threatens the autonomy of\nblack women, arguing that Du Bois recognized the limits of that\npolitics (2000, 34\u201336), Lawrie Balfour reads the essay as\ncontributing to a \u201cfeminist theory of citizenship\u201d (2011,\n99\u2013100). Taking issue with Balfour, Shatema Threadcraft argues\nthat \u201cDamnation\u201d reprises and elaborates\nSouls\u2019 masculinist treatment of manliness as an\nappropriate norm of citizenship (2017, 92\u201394). Considering Du\nBois\u2019 depiction of black women in The Philadelphia\nNegro, as well as in \u201cThe Damnation of Women,\u201d\nSaidiya Hartman relies on free indirect discourse and critical\nfabulation to put into question the validity of the objectifying\nsociological perspective from which Du Bois characterizes young black\nwomen\u2019s lives (Hartman, 2019).\n\nConsidering Du Bois in light of black feminist and more general forms\nof contemporary intersectionality theory (which considers\nintersections between race, gender and class), Ange-Marie\nHancock examines Souls, Darkwater, and Dusk of\nDawn to identify insights in Du Bois\u2019s thinking that link\n\u201chis political theory with that of today\u2019s\nintersectionality theorists\u201d (2005, 82). It would be\nanachronistic to describe Du Bois as an intersectionality theorist,\nHancock admits, but she still claims that Du Bois anticipates recent\nintersectionality theory in arguing \u201cthat more than one category\nof difference should be attacked simultaneously, and, more\nimportantly, that the structures of society operate such that these\ncategories mutually reinforce social stratification for its least\nempowered inhabitants\u201d (2005, 79). \n4.2.4 Democratic Theory and Du Bois\n\nHow did Du Bois conceptualize democracy?\n\nDu Bois mentions democracy just once in Souls, where he\nstates that the \u201csoul of democracy and the safeguard of modern\nsociety\u201d is \u201c[h]onest and earnest criticism from those\nwhose interests are most nearly touched,\u2014criticism of writers by\nreaders, of government by those governed, of leaders by those\nled\u201d (1903a, 23). Du Bois defines democracy in terms of\ncriticism when he attacks Booker T. Washington for \u201chushing\ncriticism\u201d (1903a, 23). In exploring the implications of Du\nBois\u2019s statement for the picture of black politics he defends in\nSouls, Gooding-Williams raises a question as to whether elite\nleadership of backwards, black masses not competent to criticize their\nleaders could both satisfy Du Bois\u2019s definition of democracy and\nsuccessfully promote an uplift agenda (Gooding-Williams, 2009,\nchapters 1 and 4.) More recently, Nick Bromell has persuasively argued\nthat, throughout his career, Du Bois relies on the idea of\n\u201chonest and earnest criticism\u201d as a \u201cmodel of\ndemocratic reasoning,\u201d especially in addressing \u201can\nimagined polity of blacks and whites\u201d with the aim, Brommell\nargues, of reimagining and reconstructing American democracy (Bromell,\n2018, 160, 168).\n\nDu Bois\u2019s most thoroughgoing and sustained contributions to\ndemocratic theory can be found in \u201cThe African Roots of\nWar\u201d (1915), \u201cOf The Ruling of Men\u201d (chapter 6 of\nDarkwater), and Black Reconstruction. \n\nIn \u201cThe African Roots of War,\u201d Du Bois advances a theory\nof \u201cdemocratic despotism,\u201d which he presents as the\nsolution to a philosophical paradox. \u201cMost philosophers,\u201d\nhe writes, \u201csee the ship of state launched on the broad,\nirresistible tide of democracy, with only delaying eddies here and\nthere.\u201d \u201cOthers,\u201d however, \u201clooking closer,\nare more disturbed. Are we, they ask, reverting to aristocracy and\ndespotism \u2013 the rule of might?\u201d The paradox is not simply\nconceptual, but readily observable in the world, for it has\n\u201creconciled the Imperialists and captains of industry to any\namount of \u2018Democracy\u2019,\u201d while allowing \u201cin\nAmerica the most rapid advance of democracy to go hand in\nhand\u2026with increased aristocracy and hatred toward darker\nraces.\u201d Du Bois\u2019s solution is straightforward: \u201cThe\nparadox is easily explained,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe white\nworkingman has been asked to share the spoil of exploiting\n\u2018chinks and niggers.\u2019\u201d For Du Bois, the paradox of\nmodern democracy is explained by the circumstance that democratic\nprogress within Europe and America for white laborers has entailed the\ndespotic exploitation in America and elsewhere of \u201cchinks\u2019\nand \u2018niggers\u2019\u201d (Du Bois, 1915, pp.....)\n\nDu Bois\u2019s theory of democratic despotism is a theory of\ndemocracy as it actually exists in Europe and the United\nStates--more exactly, of western democracies\u2019s entanglement with\nempire. Scholars of Du Bois\u2019s \u201cinternational\nthought\u201d have given particular attention to his theory of\ndemocratic despotism, arguing that it marks an important shift in his\nthinking. According to Ines Valdez, for example, the theory of\ndemocratic despotism completes Du Bois\u2019s move away from a\n\u201ccivilizationist\u201d and \u201cdevelopmentalist\u201d\nunderstanding of the international order, thus initiating his\narticulation of a \u201ctransnational cosmopolitanism\u201d that\nrevises Kantian as well as recent neo-Kantian accounts of cosmopoitan\nhospitality. (Valdez, 2019, chapter 3). According to Adom Getchew and\nJennifer Pitts, Du Bois\u2019s theory transforms his account of the\nglobal color line making clear that western imperialism was a\n\u201ccolaborative and shared Euro-American enterprise\u201d and\nthat practices of subordinated inclusion, as well as racialized\nexclusion, helped to secure the stability of empire (Getachew and\nPitts, 2022, xx-xxxi).\n\nIn \u201cOf the Ruling of Men\u201d, Du Bois defends the ideal\nof universal suffrage. In addition, he engages familiar,\nTocquevillian worries about the tyranny of the majority; envisions\ndemocratic decision making in deliberative democratic terms; and\ndefends not only a broadly inclusive form of political democracy, but\nthe idea that modern industry should be subject to democratic decision\nmaking\u2014in essence, the idea of democratic socialism. Du\nBois\u2019s argument for inclusiveness, for extending the right of\ndemocratic participation to women and blacks, for example, is\nessentially epistemic: \u201conly the sufferer knows his\nsuffering and\u2026no state can be strong which excludes from its\nexpressed wisdom the knowledge possessed by mothers, wives, and\ndaughters\u2026The same arguments apply to other excluded\ngroups\u201d (1920, 69; for detailed discussion of Du Bois\u2019s\nepistemic defense of democracy, see, also, Bright, 2017, 14\u201315,\nDarby, 2020, and Gooding-Williams, 2023). For a consideration of Du\nBois\u2019s essay in the perspective of Classical political thought,\nsee Fertik (2019).\n\nIn Black Reconstruction, no less than in \u201cOf the Ruling\nof Men,\u201d Du Bois characterizes democracy in economic as well as\npolitical terms; that is, as the legitimate transfer of political and\neconomic power from the ruling classes to the working masses. Cornel\nWest interprets Black Reconstruction as promoting a Deweyan\nnotion of creative democracy (West, 1988). Gooding-Williams (1991)\ndisputes that interpretation, arguing that it obscures the\nconnotations of class struggle that attach to Du Bois\u2019s account\nof black workers\u2019 efforts to reconstruct democracy. In Color\nand Democracy (1946), which Du Bois published just a little more\nthan a decade after Black Reconstruction, he writes that\n\u201c[m]ore important than political democracy is industrial\ndemocracy; that is, the voice which the actual worker, whether his\nwork be manual or mental, has in the organization and conduct of\nindustry\u201d (1946,\n 300).[39]\n\nFor the purposes of democratic theory, Black\nReconstruction\u2019s most important idea is the idea of\nabolition democracy. For Du Bois, \u2018abolition democracy\u2019\nnames both a political movement and the ideal that the movement failed\nto realize. Du Bois argues that realizing the ideal of abolition\ndemocracy required more than the satisfaction of the moral demand to\nemancipate the slaves, but, in Angela Davis\u2019s words, the\nestablishment of \u201cnew institutions\u201d\u2014specifically,\ninstitutions that provided the former slaves with the the economic,\npolitical, and educations means that were needed fully to\n\u201cincorporate black people into the social order.\u201d Drawing\non Hegel\u2019s concept of objective spirit, especially as he\ndevelops it in The Philosophy of Right, Elvira Basevich\nsimilarly argues that Du Bois saw the freedman and their allies as\nadvancing a conception of democracy that called for the transformation\nof American Sittlichkeit (Ethical Life) through the\n\u201creconstitution of the black family, civil society, and the\nfederal state\u201d (see Du Bois, 98, 151, 169; Davis, 2005,\n95\u201396; and Basevich, 2021, chapter 5).\n\nThe ongoing importance of Du Bois\u2019s contributions to democratic\ntheory has been well established by the recent work of Lawrie Balfour\nand Tommie Shelby.\n\nIn her essays on Darkwater, Dusk of Dawn, and other writings,\nfor example, Balfour subtly brings Du Bois\u2019s political thought\ninto conversation with the work of contemporary political theorists.\nTo reorient democratic theory in dark times, Balfour argues, we would\ndo well to think politically with Du Bois. To that end, she examines\nthe political-theoretical ramifications of Du Bois\u2019s literary\nchoices; his use of history to highlight the implication of\nAmerica\u2019s slave past in its post-Civil Rights present; his\ndepiction of African American lives as exemplary representatives of\ndemocratic possibility; and his globally expansive political\nimagination, which, Balfour argues, reveals the racial politics of\nrecent defenses of cosmopolitanism and civic nationalism (Balfour,\n2010,\n 2011).[40]\n\nIn Shelby\u2019s view, Du Bois took African-Americans to be the\nbearers of a world-historical mission to perfect the ideals of\nAmerican democracy. Du Bois endorsed black political solidarity,\nShelby argues, as a temporary and, possibly, long-term strategy for\nestablishing a multiracial, culturally pluralist American polity that\nembodied those ideals. Shelby follows Du Bois in maintaining that\nblack political solidarity in the pursuit of a racial justice that is\nconsonant with American democratic and liberal ideals requires a\nmotivational foundation that unites self-interest, moral principle,\nand racial identification (Shelby, 2007, 6\u20137, 67, 87).\n4.2.5 Freud, Du Bois, and the Long Siege\n\nIn chapter 1 of Dusk of Dawn, Du Bois describes his thought\nregarding the causes of the oppression of the darker races as evolving\nthrough three stages\u2014roughly, from thinking that racial\noppression was caused by ignorance; to thinking that it was caused by\nignorance and ill-will; to thinking that it was caused by\nignorance and ill-will and a conjunction of economic\nmotives and unconscious, irrational acts and reactions. Corresponding\nto each stage, Du Bois tells us, was an increasingly complex account\nof the political strategies the darker races require to upend racial\noppression. Where ignorance is the problem, science and education is\nneeded to fight racial injustice; where ill-will is the issue, the\nblack world must fight for its freedom, relying on truth, boycott,\npropaganda and mob frenzy as instruments of sudden and immediate\nassault. Where, finally, economic interest and/or unconscious,\nirrational motive sustain racial oppression, \u201cnot sudden assault\nbut long siege was indicated; careful planning and subtle campaign\nwith the education of growing generations and propaganda\u201d (1940,\n2\u20133).\n\nPrior to 1940, some consideration of each of these causes of\noppression and related strategies of resistance is evident in Du\nBois\u2019s writings. Still, Dusk of Dawn is remarkable for\nthe prominence it gives to the role of unconscious and irrational\npsychological forces in accounting for the existence and perpetuation\nof racial oppression. Du Bois attributes this new emphasis to the\n\u201cnew psychology\u201d of the \u201cFreudian era.\u201d His\n\u201cstudy of psychology under William James\u201d had prepared him\nfor the Freudian turn, he remarks, and its \u201cmeaning and\nimplications\u2026had begun slowly to penetrate his thought\u201d\n(1940, 148).\n\nContemporary political theorists have, for the most part, tended to\nignore Du Bois\u2019s Freud-inspired account of racial oppression. An\nexception is Shannon Sullivan, for whom Du Bois suggests \u201ca\npowerful psychoanalytic-pragmatist model for surveying the unconscious\noperations of white domination\u201d (Sullivan, 2006, 23). A second\nexception is Ella Myers, who has begun to build on Du Bois\u2019s\narguments to reflect on the visceral and affective registers of\nantiblack racism (Myers,\n 2017).[41]\n Robert Gooding-Williams (2011) has adapted Du Bois\u2019s idea of a\n\u201clong siege\u201d against racial oppression\u2014against what\nDu Bois also calls \u201cthe strongholds of color\ncaste\u201d\u2014to a critical analysis of some recent discussions\nof racial politics (1940, 148).\n",
