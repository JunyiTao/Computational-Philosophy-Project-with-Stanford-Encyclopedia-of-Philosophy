    "main_text": "Bottom-up and Top-Down Approaches to Aesthetics\n2. Bottom-up and Top-Down Approaches to Aesthetics\n\nA good deal of empirical work on the aesthetic, while not deriving\nfrom hostility to philosophical ideas, adopts a \u201cbottom\nup\u201d approach, focusing on the immediate reactions of untutored\nsubjects to simple stimuli. We have seen that, by contrast,\nphilosophical aesthetics is much concerned with normative issues of\njudgement and value, and with the claimed dependence of these things\non training, knowledge and what is sometimes called\n\u201ctaste\u201d, But these empirical studies are not\nphilosophically irrelevant; we should not assume that the aesthetic\nresponses of experts are discontinuous with those of na\u00efve\nsubjects (though for a discussion of the burden of proof here see\nWilliamson 2011), nor that expert judgements are sensitive only to the\nfactors that experts themselves endorse. It is important to ask\nwhether there are baseline aesthetic responses, perhaps invariant\nacross cultures, from which the great variety of aesthetic traditions\nemerge, and which may impose limits on those traditions and their\nproducts (for a defence of this \u201cbottom up\u201d approach to\nexperiments in aesthetic see McManus 2011). W\u00f6lfflin, a founder\nof modern art history, had an interest in questions framed in this\nway: he claimed, for example, that there is a general tendency to\nprefer a rightward placement of a significant object within an image\n(1928). Subsequent research suggests a more complex picture, with\npreference dependent on physical and cultural factors: handedness, and\nwhether one reads/writes left-to-right or right-to-left (see Palmer,\nGardner, & Wickens 2008 for references and discussion; Chahboun et\nal. 2017 found some limited support for the idea that placement\npreference depends on the subject\u2019s direction of\nreading/writing). Other studies have shown robust preferences for\ncertain colours (Palmer & Schloss 2010), shapes, positioning of\nobjects within a frame (Palmer, Gardner, & Wickens 2008) and size\n(Linsen, Leyssen, Sammartino, & Palmer 2011). These preferences\noften turn out to be ecologically driven; for example, people tend to\nlike the colours of liked objects, with strong and culturally\ninvariant liking of saturated blue and invariant hostility to colours\nassociated with faeces and vomit. There are cultural variations; for\nexample Japanese subjects appear to be unusual in their lack of\nenthusiasm for dark red (Palmer & Schloss 2010). Some colour\npreferences are very culturally specific, as with the preferences of\ncollege students for colours associated with their schools (Schloss,\nPoggesi, & Palmer 2011).\n\nStudies such as these may be thought valuable in their capacity to\nexplain persistent features of aesthetic artefact-making but are\nunlikely to provide more than a general background against which\naesthetic preferences and judgements, debates and disagreements\nconcerning particular artefacts are played out. Saturated blue will be\nthe right colour in a certain context, while muddy brown will be right\nin another. We cannot say that the presence of saturated blue in a\npicture is in general a reason, even a pro tanto reason, for\nadmiring it or preferring it to a picture without that colour. When it\ncomes to aesthetic reasons and judgements rather than unreflective\npreferences\u2014when, that is, we consider top-down\neffects\u2014cognitive science so far offers little to help us. This\nmay to some extent be due to the nature of human cognition itself.\nAesthetic reasons, in so far as we have them at all, are highly\nresistant to formulation in general terms (Sibley 1959), and once we\nabandon the view that aesthetic qualities supervene on an\nobject\u2019s appearance narrowly described (colour, shape and size\nin the case of visual art), there is no obvious way to limit the\nfactors that legitimately impact on such judgements. This suggests a\ndomain where, roughly speaking, everything is relevant to everything:\nthe isotropy that is crucial to Fodor\u2019s (1983) scepticism about\na cognitive science of thinking. One recent study does attempt a\nunification of top-down and bottom-up approaches. Bullot and Reber\n(2013) develop a \u201cpsycho-historical\u201d process that begins\nwith a perceptual confrontation with the work, and culminates in\nartistic understanding, mediated by the viewer\u2019s adoption of the\ndesign stance which involves reconstructing the genealogy of the work.\nThis approach encounters two difficulties. First is their assumption\nthat progress between stages is able to be done largely by the\nextraction of information from the perceptual signal. In fact the\nwork\u2019s appearance is often ambiguous or misleading as to its\nhistory\u2014as when a work is carefully constructed to look\nhaphazard in its construction (Levinson 2013; Ross 2013). The model\nneeds to recognise the importance of art-historical knowledge gained\nfrom such sources as lectures and text books, knowledge which will\noften precede and inform the first stage. The second objection\nconcerns the role of presumed essentialist assumptions in\npeople\u2019s approach to art works. Bullot and Reber argue that the\nhistorical nature of appreciation is explained by our commitment to\npsychological essentialism which makes us look beyond a things\nappearance to investigate its essence (2013: 132). But an inclination\nto look beyond appearances need not depend on essentialism; it might\nbe that the interest or value of a thing sometimes resides in its\nrelational and contingent properties (Korsgaard 1983). Valuing a work\non account of its history of making no more implies an essential\nconnection between the work and its history than valuing an object\nbecause it was a gift from a loved one implies an essential connection\nbetween the object and the giver.\n",
