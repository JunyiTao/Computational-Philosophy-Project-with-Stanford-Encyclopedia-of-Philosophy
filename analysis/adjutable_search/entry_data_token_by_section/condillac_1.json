The Metaphysics of Condillac\u2019s Sensationism\n\nCondillac\u2019s account of the development of our cognitive\ncapacities was informed by a particular conception of the nature of\nthe mind and the sensations it is originally given. He argued that the\nmind must be an unextended or immaterial substance (Essay\nI.i.1\n \u00a76).[1]\n When it senses, nothing actually passes into it from the outside\nworld or the body. Instead the action of external objects on the sense\norgans brings about changes in the body and these changes serve as the\nmerely occasional cause of the production of sensations in the mind.\n\n\nSensations are modifications of our being. To understand them as\nimages of something distinct from us is to treat them as\n\u201cideas\u201d rather than simply as \u201csensations,\u201d\nand that is an operation that is so far from being automatic that it\nexceeds the capacities of animals. However, unlike Reid, who was later\nto argue for a rigorous distinction between sensations, considered as\nstates of feeling experienced by the mind, and perceptions, considered\nas acts of thinking something about an object, Condillac maintained\nthat sensations do lend themselves to being treated as ideas. He\ndenied that sensations are \u201csomething that only occurs aside\nfrom thoughts and modifies them\u201d and insisted that they are\n\u201cas representative\u201d as any other thought experienced by\nthe mind (Essay I.ii.2 \u00a79).\n",
