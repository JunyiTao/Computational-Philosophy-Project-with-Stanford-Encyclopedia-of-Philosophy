    "main_text": "Some related terms || Bullshit\n6.4 Bullshit\n\nThe term \u201cbullshit\u201d was introduced into philosophy by\nHarry Frankfurt, who first discussed it in a 1986 essay (Raritan\nQuarterly Review) and developed the discussion into a book\n(2005). Frankfurt used the term to describe a type of falsehood that does\nnot amount to lying. A person who lies deliberately chooses not to\ntell the truth, whereas a person who utters bullshit is not interested\nin whether what (s)he says is true or false, only in its suitability\nfor his or her purpose. Moberger (2020) has proposed that\npseudoscience should be seen as a special case of bullshit, understood\nas \u201ca culpable lack of epistemic conscientiousness\u201d. \n",
