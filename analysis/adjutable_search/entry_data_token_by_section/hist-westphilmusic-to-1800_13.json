On the one hand, the budding\nscientific outlook favored the extension of the experimental method to\nthe realm of sound, an operation that obviously included mathematical\nmodeling. Thus, rather than giving up on mathematical descriptions of\nmusic altogether, early modern theorists abandoned the abstract\nframework in which these descriptions had been formulated. On the\nother hand, accounts of music in mathematical terms continued to\nsurvive in the metaphysical speculations of music theorists and\nphilosophers.\n\nExemplary of these tendencies is the French mathematician Marin\nMersenne (1588\u20131648), who was interested in a number of\nquestions connected to the mathematical nature of music. While he\nunderstood the importance of empirical verification, Mersenne was also\nconvinced of a fundamental harmony between the mathematical order of\nmusic and that of the whole cosmos, as evident from the title of his\nmost important work, Harmonie Universelle (1636).\n\nA particularly interesting theme in this sprawling treatise is the\ncontrast between the rational structure of music and its sensuous\nappearance, best illustrated through Mersenne\u2019s discussion of\nconsonance. Having defined consonance in terms of coincidence in air\nvibrations, Mersenne had to explain why consonance and sensory\nagreeableness do not always go hand in hand. For instance, the major\nthird is more agreeable than the fourth, although this is more\nconsonant. Mersenne had an interesting correspondence with Descartes\non the matter, in which the former manifests his wish to provide a\ndefinition of agreeableness that is as objective as that of\nconsonance, while the latter expresses skepticism about the project,\nand claims that agreeableness is dependent on variation in taste, as\nwell as in musical context (see Jorgensen 2012).\n\nEarly in his life, Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) devoted a\ntreatise to music, the Compendium Musicae (written in 1618\nand published posthumously in 1650). This work is dominated by\nscientific concerns rather than philosophical ones, but the very start\nof the treatise is characteristic of its age, as Descartes states that\nmusic\u2019s goal is \u201cto please and to arouse various\nAffections in us\u201d (Descartes 1650). But Descartes\u2019s most\nimportant impact on philosophy of music is actually due to his\ntreatise on emotions, The Passions of the Soul (1649). In\nthis work, Descartes defines emotions as the result of the action\nproduced by external objects on the animal spirits, a thin air-like\nsubstance that stirs our passions whenever it is set in motion.\nDescartes also distinguishes six basic emotions: wonder, love, hatred,\ndesire, joy, and sadness.\n\nThis taxonomy of emotions and the mechanistic description of their\nfunctioning will prove important to the so-called\nAffektenlehre, or doctrine of the affections, the eighteenth\ncentury view that a piece of music should arouse a specific emotion in\nthe listener. Affektenlehre theorists believed that this goal\ncould be achieved through the use of specific musical devices, each\nassociated with a given emotion. The German composer Johann Mattheson\nmay be considered the most prominent representative of this tradition.\nHe explicitly endorses Descartes\u2019 theory of emotions in his\ntreatise Der vollkommene Capellmeister (Mattheson 1739: I,\niii, \u00a751).\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716), philosopher and\nmathematician, devoted to music only scattered observations. Yet, his\nview of music\u2019s value is of particular interest, as it is\nindicative of the attempt to reconcile rational and sensuous elements\nin our appreciation of music (see Fubini 1991: 149). Leibniz accepts\nthat the main goal of music is to move us. In fact, he notes that,\nwhile music is obviously so apt to do so, \u201cthis main purpose is\nnot usually sufficiently noticed or sought after\u201d (Leibniz,\nOn Wisdom). However, Leibniz also specifies that this\nsensuous pleasure is the result of the automatic and unconscious\napprehension through music of the rational structure of the universe.\nHe writes:\n\n\nMusic charms us, although its beauty consists only in the agreement of\nnumbers and in the counting, which we do not perceive but which the\nsoul nevertheless continues to carry out, of the beats or vibrations\nof sounding bodies which coincide at certain intervals.
