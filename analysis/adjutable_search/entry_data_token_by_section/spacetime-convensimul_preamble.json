    "main_text": "\n\n\nIn his first paper on the special theory of relativity, Einstein\nindicated that the question of whether or not two spatially separated\nevents were simultaneous did not necessarily have a definite answer,\nbut instead depended on the adoption of a convention for its\nresolution. Some later writers have argued that Einstein\u2019s choice of a\nconvention is, in fact, the only possible choice within the framework\nof special relativistic physics, while others have maintained that\nalternative choices, although perhaps less convenient, are indeed\npossible.\n",
