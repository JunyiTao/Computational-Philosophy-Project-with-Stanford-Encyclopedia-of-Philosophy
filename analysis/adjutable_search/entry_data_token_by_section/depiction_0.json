    "main_text": "Resemblance Theories of Depiction || Resemblance and its Critics\n1.1 Resemblance and its Critics\n\nResemblance theories of depiction are commonly traced to\nRepublic, book X, where Plato suggests that a painting of an\nobject is a mimesis (imitation or representation) of its\nshape and colour. The idea is intuitively plausible, and it provides\nthe basis for a variety of attempts by philosophers to define or\nanalyse the concept of a picture, or to explain how pictures\nrepresent. It is true that pictures represent things that do not have\nshapes or colours, such as God and Justice, but they do so by\ndepicting things that do have shapes and colours, such as bearded men\nand blindfolded women carrying scales. Accordingly, the basic thought\nthat underlies resemblance theories of depiction is that pictures are\ncomposed of shapes and colours that resemble the shapes and colours of\nthe visible objects they depict. But even if this provides an adequate\nstarting-point, a convincing theory of depiction needs to be\nelaborated with care, as Nelson Goodman (1968) showed. The simplistic\nclaim that A depicts B if and only if A\nappreciably resembles B is demonstrably false. According to\nGoodman \u201cmore error could hardly be compressed into so short a\nformula\u201d (1968: 3\u20134).\n\nAs a matter of fact, the simplistic formula Goodman attacks was never\nproposed by Charles Sanders Peirce or his followers, such as Suzanne\nLanger (1942) and John Hospers (1947), whose semiotic theories were\nGoodman\u2019s immediate target, or by any other philosopher or\ntheorist of art. Peirce described pictures as iconic signs,\ni.e., signs that signify objects by resembling them, and he contrasted\niconic signs with indices, which signify objects by standing in\nspatial, temporal or causal relations to them, and with\nsymbols, which signify objects by means of conventions\n(Peirce 1982, Vol. 2: 53\u201356). But this classification depends on\nthe basic idea of signification, which Peirce holds is a three-termed\nrelation between a sign, its object, and an\n\u201cinterpretant\u201d, i.e., a thought of the object or a\ntranslation of the sign. Moreover, Peirce acknowledges that these\nthree categories of sign are not mutually exclusive, and that the\nsignification of a picture can also depend on iconographic\nconventions, and on its context of use.\n\nHence, Peirce\u2019s conception of depiction is not captured by the\nformula Goodman criticizes. But arguably the formula has some\nheuristic value, because it draws attention to some of the challenges\na theory that explains depiction in terms of resemblance will need to\naddress. Thus, according to Goodman, resemblance is a reflexive and\nsymmetric relation, whereas representation is neither: an object\nresembles itself to the maximum degree but does not normally represent\nitself, and the object that a picture represents does not represent\nthe picture, although it resembles the picture to exactly the same\ndegree and in exactly the same respects as the picture resembles it.\nFurthermore, many pictures resemble other pictures, such as copies of\nthem, more closely than they resemble their objects, but they do not\nrepresent those pictures. \u201cPlainly\u201d Goodman concludes\n\u201cresemblance in any degree is no sufficient condition for\nrepresentation\u201d(1968: 4).\n\nAs we have indicated, Goodman\u2019s initial challenge to resemblance\ntheories of depiction does not show that the approach is wrong. For\naccording to philosophers who favour the approach, the idea of\nresemblance is used to explain what makes a pictorial representation\nspecifically pictorial, rather than what makes it generically\nrepresentational. The depictive relation between a portrait and its\nsubject is indeed neither reflexive nor symmetric. But resemblance\nremains a candidate for explaining what makes a representation\npictorial or figurative, and therefore how a portrait of an individual\ndiffers from a text describing her appearance. For comparison, the\nreferential relation between the indexical \u201cnow\u201d and the\ntime it refers to is neither reflexive nor symmetric, but this does\nnot prevent us from explaining how \u201cnow\u201d refers to a\nspecific time in terms of simultaneity (between the use of the word\nand the time referred to), which is both.\n\nHowever, the example of a portrait brings us to another objection to\nresemblance theories of depiction, which Goodman mentions in passing\n(1968: 25), and others have accorded greater weight (Hopkins 1998b;\nAbell 2009). For if resemblance is a relation, and if the relata of a\nrelation must be existing particulars, then it appears that pictures\nthat represent fictional individuals (Zeus, Pegasus), and genre\npictures, which represent kinds of objects without representing any\nparticular instances of them, cannot resemble what they represent.\nHence, even if it is plausible that a resemblance theory can explain\nhow a portrait represents a sitter, it cannot provide a general\nexplanation of depiction.\n\nOne response to this argument is to claim that fictional characters\nare abstract entities that actually exist (Kripke 2013: 73). Another\nis to claim that a fictional character can be a genuine relatum of a\nrelation without existing: it is sufficient that it is capable of\nbeing identified, referred to, and described, and meeting these\nconditions does not require existence (Rundle 1979: 249; Sainsbury\n2005: ch. 6). But even if one of these responses is correct, and the\nobjection therefore fails to show that the concept of resemblance is\nunsuited to explaining how pictures represent fictional characters,\nthe problem of genre pictures remains. However, John Hyman (2012:\n129\u2013132) has argued that the verb \u201cresemble\u201d\nsometimes expresses a relation and sometimes does not. For instance,\nin the sentence \u201cDarwin resembles Socrates\u201d,\n\u201cresembles\u201d expresses a relation, whereas in the sentence\n\u201cSocrates resembles a satyr\u201d, it is a copular (linking)\nverb. Thus, according to Hyman, \u201cresembles\u201d, \u201clooks\nlike\u201d, \u201cis like\u201d, etc. have the same kind of dual\nuse as \u201cis\u201d, which can either express identity or have a\ncopular function (Russell 1914: 48). If this is right, the objection\nalso fails to show that the concept of resemblance is unsuited to\nexplaining generic depiction (cf. Blumson 2014).\n\nGoodman places more weight on a third objection to resemblance\ntheories of depiction. A theory of this kind, he maintains, would need\nto specify the visible aspect or aspects of its object that a picture\nimitates or copies. But every object can be seen in many ways,\ndepending on the experience, interests, and attitudes of the viewer:\n\u201cthe object before me is a man, a swarm of atoms, a complex of\ncells, a fiddler, a friend, a fool and much more\u201d (1968: 8).\nSince the artist cannot copy all of these aspects at once, all of the\nways the object is or looks, one might assume that her aim is to strip\naway the varnish of perceptual habit, prejudice or interpretation, and\ncapture the object as seen \u201cunder aseptic conditions by the free\nand innocent eye\u201d. But, Goodman claims, following Ernst Gombrich\n(1960), \u201cthere is no innocent eye\u201d: the idea that we can\naccess some raw visual data by means of \u201cpurification rites or\nby methodical disinterpretation\u201d is a myth. Both \u201cthe way\nwe see and the way we depict depends upon and varies with experience,\npractice, interests, and attitudes\u201d (Goodman 1968: 10).\n\nAccording to Goodman and Gombrich, resemblance theories of depiction\ndepend on the mistaken assumption that visual perceptions result from\na process of interpreting two-dimensional patterns of raw colour,\nwithout any intrinsic meaning, which artists are trained to observe\nand record. Psychologists such as Hermann von Helmholtz, artists such\nas Claude Monet, and art theorists such as John Ruskin embraced a\ntheory of painting of this kind. For instance, the passage by Ruskin\nfrom which Gombrich took the phrase \u201cinnocent eye\u201d reads\nas follows:\n\n\nThe whole technical power of painting depends on our recovery of what\nmay be called the innocence of the eye; that is to say, of a\nsort of childish perception of these flat stains of colour, merely, as\nsuch, without consciousness of what they signify. (Gombrich 1960: 296;\nquoting Ruskin 1857: 6, note 1)\n\n\nGoodman and Gombrich associate this conception of painting with\nresemblance theories of depiction. But it is not an essential part of\nsuch a theory. If the depiction of an object depends on the imitation\nof its form and colour, it follows that an artist must be able to\nperceive these properties and reproduce them, but it does not follow\nthat we need to conceive of painting in the way Ruskin recommends.\n",
