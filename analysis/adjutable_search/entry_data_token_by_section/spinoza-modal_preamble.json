    "main_text": "\n\nSpinoza\u2019s views on necessity and possibility, which he claimed\nwere the \u201cprincipal foundation\u201d of his Ethics\n(Ep75), have been less than well received by his readers, to put it\nmildly. From Spinoza\u2019s contemporaries to our own, readers of the\nEthics have denounced Spinoza\u2019s views on modality as\nmetaphysically confused at best, ethically nihilistic at\n worst.[1]\n However, expressing matters this way implies that there is a\nconsensus about Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics of modality, with\ninterpreters differing only to the extent to which they distance\nthemselves from his outrageous position. A cursory reading of certain\npassages of the Ethics supports the belief that, if Spinoza\nis clear anywhere, it is surely in his views of necessity and\ncontingency. After all, this is the philosopher who claims that\n\u201cin nature there is nothing contingent, but all things have been\ndetermined from the necessity of the divine nature to exist and\nproduce an effect in a certain way\u201d (Ip29) and that\n\u201cthings could have been produced by God in no other way, and in\nno other order than they have been produced\u201d (Ip33). Passages\nsuch as these suggest that Spinoza was a necessitarian, according to\nwhom falsity and impossibility are co-extensive. The actual world, we\nmight now say, is the only possible world. Events could not,\nin the strongest sense of that expression, have gone any differently\nthan they in fact have gone.\n\nAnd yet, such a picture of the interpretive landscape would be quite\nmisleading. Spinoza studies have seen a renaissance of interest in his\nviews on modality, spawning in recent years many articles and chapters\ndevoted to his modal views. From this boon of research and interest\n(relative to Spinoza studies), considerable disagreement has emerged\nabout Spinoza\u2019s modal commitments. Much of this disagreement\nstems from larger interpretive disagreements about Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysics. By examining Spinoza\u2019s views on modality, we will\nalso explore several of his most central metaphysical views.\n\nAfter a brief introduction, this entry begins with Spinoza\u2019s\nviews on the distribution of modal properties (section 2). With\nrespect to substances (2.1), Spinoza claims that every\npossible substance necessarily exists. Spinoza\u2019s argument for\nthis conclusion is part of his larger argument for substance\nmonism\u2014the view that only one substance exists, God.\nSpinoza\u2019s view about the modal status of modes, his\nother main ontological category, is far more controversial (2.2).\nExplaining this controversy leads into the heart of Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysics and involves his views on causation, inherence, God,\nontological plenitude and the principle of sufficient reason. Although\nthe question of whether Spinoza was a necessitarian is the predominant\ntopic of discussion in the recent secondary literature on\nSpinoza\u2019s modal views, Spinoza also sketches interesting\naccounts of the nature of modality (section 3) and the ground of\nmodality (section 4) that shed fresh light on his modal commitments.\nThough understudied by recent interpreters, these topics were of\ninterest to Spinoza\u2019s peers and remain vibrant research\nquestions in contemporary metaphysics of modality.\n",
