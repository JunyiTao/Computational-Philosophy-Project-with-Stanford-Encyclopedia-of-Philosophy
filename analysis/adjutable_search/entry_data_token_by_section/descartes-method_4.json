    "main_text": "The Method in the Rules || From Deduction to Enumeration\n2.4 From Deduction to Enumeration\n\nWhen deductions are simple, they are wholly reducible to intuition:\n\n\n\nFor if we have deduced one fact from another immediately, then\nprovided the inference is evident, it already comes under the heading\nof true intuition. (AT 10: 389, CSM 1: 26) \n\n\nHowever, when deductions are \u201ccomplex and involved\u201d (AT\n10: 408, CSM 1: 37) and \u201cwe infer a proposition from many\ndisconnected propositions\u201d, then \u201cour intellectual\ncapacity is often insufficient to enable us to encompass them all in a\nsingle intuition\u201d (AT 10: 389, CSM 1: 26). Fortunately, the\nscope of intuition can be expanded by means of an operation Descartes\nterms \u201cenumeration\u201d. Since some deductions require\n\u201csuch a long chain of inferences\u201d that it is not\n\u201ceasy to recall the entire route which led us to\u201d the\nconclusion, \u201ca continuous movement of thought is needed to make\ngood on any weakness of memory\u201d (AT 10: 387, CSM 1: 25). This\ninvolves \n\n\nsimultaneously intuiting one relation and passing on to the next,\nuntil I have learnt to pass from the first to the last so swiftly that\nmemory is left with practically no role to play, and I seem to intuit\nthe whole thing at once. (AT 10: 287\u2013388, CSM 1: 25) \n\n\nNevertheless, there is a limit to how many relations I can encompass\nin a single act of intuition. Were I to continue the series\nindefinitely, I would eventually lose track of some of the inferences\nin the deductive chain, no matter how many times I traverse the\nseries. Enumeration is a normative ideal that cannot always be\nrealized in practice.\n\nEnumeration plays many roles in Descartes\u2019 method, and most of\nthem are not related to the reduction of the role played by memory in\nlong or complex deductions (see Beck 1952: 111\u2013134; Weber 1964:\n48\u201357; Marion 1975: 103\u2013113; Smith 2010: 67\u2013113).\nOne can distinguish between five senses of enumeration in the\nRules. Enumeration1 is \u201ca verification of\nthe logical steps already traversed in a deductive process\u201d\n(Beck 1952: 143; based on Rule 7, AT 10: 387\u2013388, 14\u201325,\n1\u201317, CSM 1: 25). Enumeration1 has already been\ndiscussed above.\n\nEnumeration2 is \u201ca preliminary\nsurvey or setting out of the grounds of a demonstration\u201d (Beck\n1952: 143; based on Rule 7, AT 10: 388\u2013392, CSM 1: 25\u201328).\nHere, enumeration precedes both intuition and deduction.\nEnumeration2 determines (a) whatever simpler problems are\ncontained in a complex problem, and (b) the order in which each of\nthese problems must be solved, beginning with the simplest problem of\nall (for an example, see\n Section 3).\n\nEnumeration3 is \u201ca form of deduction based on the\nenumeration of all possible alternatives or analogous instances\u201d\n(Beck 1952: 143; based on Rule 7, AT 10: 388\u2013389, 29\u201330,\n1\u20137, CSM 1: 26 and Rule 8, AT 10: 394\u2013395, CSM 1: 29). For\nexample, \n\n\nif I wish to show [\u2026] that the rational soul is not corporeal\n[\u2026] it will be sufficient if I group all bodies together into\nseveral classes so as to demonstrate that the rational soul cannot be\nassigned to any of these. (AT 10: 390, CSM 1: 26\u201327) \n\n\nHere, enumeration is itself a form of deduction: I construct classes\nin order to deduce a conclusion. Other examples of\nenumeration3 include Descartes\u2019 enumeration of his\ndubitable opinions in Meditations I, which leads to his\ndiscovery in Meditations II that he cannot place the\nproposition \u201cI am, I exist\u201d in any of these classes (see\n Section 9).\n\nEnumeration4 is \u201c[a]kin to the actual deduction\nitself when the implicatory sequence is grounded on a complex and\ndisjointed set of data\u201d (Beck 1952: 143; based on Rule 7, AT 10:\n389, 17\u201320, CSM 1: 26) (see Beck 1952: 143).\nEnumeration4 is a deduction of a conclusion, not from a\nseries of interconnected inferences, but rather from a variety of\ndifferent inferential chains that. For example, Descartes\u2019 demonstration that the mind\nand body are two really distinct substances in Meditations VI\ndepends on a wide variety of considerations drawn from\nMeditations I\u2013V (see AT 7: 13, CSM 2: 9; letter to\nMersenne, 24 December 1640, AT 3: 266, CSM 3: 163. For an\ninterpretation along these lines, see Dubouclez 2013. For a contrary\ninterpretation, see Gueroult 1984).\n\nFinally, enumeration5 is an operation Descartes also calls\n\u201cinduction\u201d, and consists in an inference from a series of\nparticular cases satisfying a definite condition to all cases\nsatisfying the same condition, as when one infers that \u201cthe area\nof a circle is greater than the area of any other geometrical figure\nwhose perimeter is the same length as the circle\u2019s\u201d from\nthe fact \u201cthis [\u2026] holds for some particular\nfigures\u201d (AT 10: 390, CSM 1: 27).\n",
