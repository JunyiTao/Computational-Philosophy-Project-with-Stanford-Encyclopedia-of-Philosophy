    "main_text": "Kotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s Reism\n2. Kotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s Reism\n\n\nAlthough Kotarbi\u0144ski was a philosophical grandson of Brentano\n(via K. Twardowski, a student of the latter), he developed\nhis version of reism independently (Wole\u0144ski 1996, 357). This\ntook place in the 1920s. The most extensive treatment of\nKotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s reism is to be found in his\nbook Elementy, published in 1929 (in Polish). In general,\nKotarbi\u0144ski followed Brentano\u2019s criticism of abstract\nobjects.  Kotarbi\u0144ski worked with a simplified table of\nontological categories proposed by W. Wundt at the end of the\n19th century. This table includes: things, states of\naffairs, relations and properties. Accordingly, Kotarbi\u0144ski\nstated reism by two theses:\n\n(R1)\n Any object is a thing.\n\n\n(R2)\n No object is a state of affairs, relation or property.\n\n\n\n\nThe thesis (R1) was supplemented by a closer characterization of\nthings given by\n\n(R3)\n a is thing = a is a resistant and\nextended object (a material body).\n\n\n\nKotarbi\u0144ski called (R3) \u201cthe thesis of pansomatism\u201d\n(pansomatism is derived from the Greek term soma which means\n\u2018body\u2019; hence, pansomatism claims that every object is a\nbody, assuming that bodies are material). It indicates that reism\ndefined by (R1)\u2013(R3) is a kind of materialism. Kotarbi\u0144ski\nsometimes used the terms \u2018reism\u2019, \u2018pansomatism\u2019\nand \u2018concretism\u2019 as equivalents.\n\n\nThe theses (R1)\u2013(R3) concern an ontological dimension of reism\nor ontological reism. However, Kotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s reism, like\nBrentano\u2019s version of this view, also has a semantic dimension.\nSemantic reism is a theory of language. In particular, it is a theory\nof names. According to this account, names occurring in ordinary\nparlance can be divided into two categories: genuine names and\nnon-genuine names (i.e., apparent names, onomatoids). The former\ncategory is reduced to names of things in the sense of (R1) and\n(R3). Now, onomatoids seem to refer to abstract objects, but that is a\nmistake, because such objects do not exist by standards of\nreism. Kotarbi\u0144ski supplemented this distinction with a theory of\nsense. Only sentences with genuine names (and logical constants) have\na literal meaning (sense). If a sentence with onomatoids is\nreplaceable by a sentence with genuine names only (call such sentences\n\u201creistic\u201d), it is meaningful, if not it is\nmeaningless. Consider:\n\n(5)\n Wisdom is a property of some people.\n\n\n\nIt contains two apparent names, namely \u2018wisdom\u2019 and\n\u2018property\u2019. Now, according to Kotarbi\u0144ski, the content\nof (5) can be fully expressed by:\n\n(6)\n Some people are wise.\n\n\n\nThis sentence does not have any apparent name. On the other hand,\nthe sentence:\n\n(7)\n States of affairs are abstract objects.\n\n\n\nis not replaceable by any sentence in which onomatoids are replaced\nby genuine names. At first glance, onomatoids are similar to empty\nnames. Yet there is an important difference between them because\nsentences with empty names are meaningful. For example,\n\n(8)\n Centaurs are horses,\n\n\n\ndoes not need to be replaced by a reistic sentence because it is\nitself reistic. Kotarbi\u0144ski believes that (8) is meaningful,\nunlike (7), and that this shows that sentences with empty names are\nalready reistic, unlike sentences with onomatoids, which are\nmeaningless.  Sentences with apparent names have either\nmeanings via reistic translations or they are meaningless\nstrings of words. Onomatoids are dangerous, because they are sources\nof hypostatisation, which consists in committing abstract objects as\nreally existing, although their existence is apparent only. In\nparticular, hypostatisation is very common in philosophy (see the\nsentence (7) above) and leads, according to Kotarbi\u0144ski, to\npointless speculations about abstract objects, their kinds, etc.\nTherefore, reism provides a weapon against involving philosophy in\nunending pseudocontroversies. In particular, reism accuses all kinds\nof Platonism to be the source of the hopeless problems and discussions\nthat stem from admitting the existence of beings, like Platonic\nforms.\n\n\nSome points of Kotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s reism can be illuminated by\npointing out its connections with Le\u015bniewski\u2019s calculus of names\n(the Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Ontology, LO, for brevity). According to LO, a\nname is an expression which can stand for the variable b in\nthe sentence:\n\n(9)\n a is b.\n\n\n\n(Le\u015bniewski wanted to have names in the predicative position).\nIt is assumed that the copula \u2018is\u2019 has so-called\nfundamental meaning. It is established by the axiom of LO, which is,\nthe conjuction of three following sentences:\n\nThere is some x, such that x is a.\nFor any x, if x is a, then\nx is b.\nFor any x and y, if x is a\nand y is a, then x is y.\n\n\n\n\nThis axiom implies that, in order to be true, any sentence of the form (9) must\nhave a singular name (that is, a name denoting exactly one object) at\nthe place a. Furthermore, the copula \u2018is\u2019 is\ndevoid of any temporal or spatial connotations. Any sentence with an\nempty name in the position of a or b is false; thus,\n(8) is false. The sentence, \n\n(10)\n a is a thing,\n\nwhich is crucial for reism, is true only if the term a is\na name of a particular. Thus, the logical basis of reism implies that\nnames of things are singular. LO justifies also Kotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s\naccount of common nouns (general names, according to traditional\nlogic) as genuine names. Consider the sentence:\n\n(11)\n John is a sportsman,\n\n\n\nwhere \u2018John\u2019 is a proper name, that is, referring to an\nindividual person. The expression \u2018sportsman\u2019 should be\ninterpreted as \u2018one of the sportsmen\u2019, that is, it refers\nto any individual belonging to the class of sportsmen. It enables the\nreader to see a connection between \u2018John\u2019 and\n\u2018sportsman\u2019 as expressed by:\n\n(12)\n If a person is denoted by \u2018John\u2019, it is\nalso denoted by \u2018sportsman\u2019.\n\n\n\nA further possible step consists in appealing to mereology (i.e.,\nthe theory of parts and wholes) and interpreting the class of sportsmen\nas a collective (mereological) set. On the other hand, LO does not\nmotivate the division of names into genuine names and onomatoids. In\nparticular, Le\u015bniewski himself was not a reist.\n\n\nKotarbi\u0144ski argued for reism mostly pragmatically. One of his\narguments (concerning the dangers of hypostatization) has been pointed\nout already. Moreover, Kotarbi\u0144ski saw reism as a very natural\ninterpretation of natural language. He stressed that concrete terms\nprecede abstract nouns in language acquisition and that only bodies (as\ndefined by (R2), that is, pansomatically) are beings which we encounter\nin our everyday experience. Kotarbi\u0144ski himself considered the\nabove arguments for reism as sufficient, but he was perfectly conscious\nthat they provide an inductive and partial support for the reistic\nstandpoint.\n",
