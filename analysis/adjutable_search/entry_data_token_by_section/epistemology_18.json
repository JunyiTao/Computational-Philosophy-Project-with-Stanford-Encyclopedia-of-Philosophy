    "main_text": "The Structure of Knowledge and Justification || Why Coherentism?\n4.4 Why Coherentism?\n\nCoherentism is typically defended by attacking foundationalism as a\nviable alternative. To argue against privilege foundationalism,\ncoherentists pick an epistemic privilege they think is essential to\nfoundationalism, and then argue that either no beliefs, or too few\nbeliefs, enjoy such a privilege. Against experiential foundationalism,\ndifferent objections have been advanced. One line of criticism is that\nperceptual experiences don\u2019t have propositional content.\nTherefore, the relation between a perceptual belief and the perceptual\nexperience that gives rise to it can only be causal. But it is not\nclear that this is correct. When you see the hat and it looks blue to\nyou, doesn\u2019t your visual experience\u2014its looking blue to\nyou\u2014have the propositional content that the hat is\nblue? If it does, then why not allow that your perceptual\nexperience can play a justificatory\n role?[52]\n\nAnother line of thought is that, if perceptual experiences have\npropositional content, they cannot stop the justificatory regress\nbecause they would then be in need of justification themselves. That,\nhowever, is a strange thought. In our actual epistemic practice, we\nnever demand of others to justify the way things appear to them in\ntheir perceptual experiences. Indeed, such a demand would seem absurd.\nSuppose I ask you: \u201cWhy do you think that the hat is\nblue?\u201d You answer: \u201cBecause it looks blue to me\u201d.\nThere are sensible further questions I might ask at that point. For\ninstance, I might ask: \u201cWhy do you think its looking blue to you\ngives you a reason for believing it is blue?\u201d Or I might ask:\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you be mistaken in believing it looks blue to\nyou?\u201d But now suppose I ask you: \u201cWhy do you suppose the\nperceptual experience in which the hat looks blue to you is\njustified?\u201d In response to that question, you should accuse me\nof misusing the word \u201cjustification\u201d. I might as well ask\nyou what it is that justifies your headache when you have one, or what\njustifies the itch in your nose when you have one. The latter\nquestions, you should reply, would be as absurd as my request for\nstating a justifying reason for your perceptual\n experience.[53]\n\nExperiential foundationalism, then, is not easily dislodged. On what\ngrounds could coherentists object to it? To raise problems for\nexperiential foundationalism, coherentists could press the J-question:\nWhy are perceptual experiences a source of justification? If\nfoundationalists answer the J-question appealing to evidence that\nwarrants the attribution of reliability to perceptual experiences,\nexperiential foundationalism morphs into dependence coherentism. To\navoid this outcome, foundationalists would have to give an alternative\nanswer. One way of doing this would be to adopt the epistemic\nconception of basicality, and view it as a matter of brute necessity\nthat perception is a source of justification. It remains to be seen\nwhether such a view is sustainable.\n",
