    "main_text": "\n\nThe value of knowledge has always been a central topic within\nepistemology. Going all the way back to Plato\u2019s Meno,\nphilosophers have asked, why is knowledge more valuable than mere true\nbelief? Interest in this question has grown in recent years, with\ntheorists proposing a range of answers. But some reject the premise of\nthe question and claim that the value of knowledge is\n\u2018swamped\u2019 by the value of true belief. And others argue\nthat statuses other than knowledge, such as justification or\nunderstanding, are distinctively valuable. We will call the general\nquestion of why knowledge is valuable the value problem.\n",
