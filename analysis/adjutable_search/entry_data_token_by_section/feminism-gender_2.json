    "main_text": "The sex/gender distinction. || Gender terminology\n1.2 Gender terminology\n\nIn order to distinguish biological differences from\nsocial/psychological ones and to talk about the latter, feminists\nappropriated the term \u2018gender\u2019. Psychologists writing on\ntranssexuality were the first to employ gender terminology in this\nsense. Until the 1960s, \u2018gender\u2019 was often used to refer\nto masculine and feminine words, like le and la in\nFrench. However, in order to explain why some people felt that they\nwere \u2018trapped in the wrong bodies\u2019, the psychologist\nRobert Stoller (1968) began using the terms \u2018sex\u2019 to pick\nout biological traits and \u2018gender\u2019 to pick out the amount\nof femininity and masculinity a person exhibited. Although (by and\nlarge) a person\u2019s sex and gender complemented each other,\nseparating out these terms seemed to make theoretical sense allowing\nStoller to explain the phenomenon of transsexuality:\ntranssexuals\u2019 sex and gender simply don\u2019t match.\n\nAlong with psychologists like Stoller, feminists found it useful to\ndistinguish sex and gender. This enabled them to argue that many\ndifferences between women and men were socially produced and,\ntherefore, changeable. Gayle Rubin (for instance) uses the phrase\n\u2018sex/gender system\u2019 in order to describe \u201ca set of\narrangements by which the biological raw material of human sex and\nprocreation is shaped by human, social intervention\u201d (1975,\n165). Rubin employed this system to articulate that \u201cpart of\nsocial life which is the locus of the oppression of women\u201d\n(1975, 159) describing gender as the \u201csocially imposed division\nof the sexes\u201d (1975, 179). Rubin\u2019s thought was that\nalthough biological differences are fixed, gender differences are the\noppressive results of social interventions that dictate how women and\nmen should behave. Women are oppressed as women and \u201cby\nhaving to be women\u201d (Rubin 1975, 204). However, since\ngender is social, it is thought to be mutable and alterable by\npolitical and social reform that would ultimately bring an end to\nwomen\u2019s subordination. Feminism should aim to create a\n\u201cgenderless (though not sexless) society, in which one\u2019s\nsexual anatomy is irrelevant to who one is, what one does, and with\nwhom one makes love\u201d (Rubin 1975, 204).\n\nIn some earlier interpretations, like Rubin\u2019s, sex and gender\nwere thought to complement one another. The slogan \u2018Gender is\nthe social interpretation of sex\u2019 captures this view. Nicholson\ncalls this \u2018the coat-rack view\u2019 of gender: our sexed\nbodies are like coat racks and \u201cprovide the site upon which\ngender [is] constructed\u201d (1994, 81). Gender conceived of as\nmasculinity and femininity is superimposed upon the\n\u2018coat-rack\u2019 of sex as each society imposes on sexed bodies\ntheir cultural conceptions of how males and females should behave.\nThis socially constructs gender differences \u2013 or the amount of\nfemininity/masculinity of a person \u2013 upon our sexed bodies. That\nis, according to this interpretation, all humans are either male or\nfemale; their sex is fixed. But cultures interpret sexed bodies\ndifferently and project different norms on those bodies thereby\ncreating feminine and masculine persons. Distinguishing sex and\ngender, however, also enables the two to come apart: they are\nseparable in that one can be sexed male and yet be gendered a woman,\nor vice versa (Haslanger 2000b; Stoljar 1995).\n\nSo, this group of feminist arguments against biological determinism\nsuggested that gender differences result from cultural practices and\nsocial expectations. Nowadays it is more common to denote this by\nsaying that gender is socially constructed. This means that genders\n(women and men) and gendered traits (like being nurturing or\nambitious) are the \u201cintended or unintended product[s] of a\nsocial practice\u201d (Haslanger 1995, 97). But which social\npractices construct gender, what social construction is and what being\nof a certain gender amounts to are major feminist controversies. There\nis no consensus on these issues.
