    "main_text": "Early Idealistic Pantheism\n2. Early Idealistic Pantheism\n\nIn an essay published in 1835, Heinrich Heine observed that pantheism\nhad by this time become \u201cthe secret religion of\n Germany\u201d.[10]\n That Feuerbach is generally remembered as an atheist and a\nmaterialist has tended to obscure the fact that he began his\nphilosophical career as an enthusiastic adherent of this philosophical\nreligion, one early expression of which can be found in the Greek\nwords \u201cHen kai Pan\u201d (One and All) inscribed in\n1791 by H\u00f6lderlin in Hegel\u2019s student album from\nT\u00fcbingen (cf. Pinkard 2000:\n 32).[11]\n This inscription is an allusion to words uttered by Lessing after\nreading Goethe\u2019s poem-fragment, \u201cPrometheus\u201d, and\nresponding enthusiastically by declaring himself a Spinozist,\naccording to the account contained in Jacobi\u2019s famous\nLetters on the Doctrine of Spinoza (1785; cf. Jacobi [MPW]:\n187). It was the publication of these letters that set off the\noriginal Pantheism Controversy, and had the unintended effect of\nleading more than one generation of young German poets and thinkers to\nregard Spinoza no longer as a \u201cdead dog\u201d and a godless\natheist, but rather as the God-intoxicated sage of a pantheistic creed\nin which those who, like Lessing, could no longer\n\u201cstomach\u201d orthodox conceptions of the divinity that make a\nstrict distinction between creator and creation, could seek to satisfy\ntheir spiritual aspirations. Feuerbach included several verses of the\nPrometheus-fragment as an epigram to his first book, in which he used\nthe tools of Hegelian logic to develop a conception of the divinity as\nOne and All along lines laid out by Spinoza, Giordano Bruno and Jacob\nBoehme. These three he hailed as \u2018pious God-inspired\nsages\u2019 (GTU 241/48) who set the table for the \u2018feast of\nreconciliation\u2019 (GTU 463/214) between nature and spirit that it\nis that task of the modern age to celebrate. But this reconciliation,\nhe argued, cannot occur as long as God continues to be thought of as\nan individual person existing independently of the world.\n\nThat Feuerbach, unlike Strauss, never accepted Hegel\u2019s\ncharacterization of Christianity as the consummate religion is clear\nfrom the contents of a letter he sent to Hegel along with his\ndissertation in\n 1828.[12]\n In this letter he identified the historical task remaining in the\nwake of Hegel\u2019s philosophical achievement to be the\nestablishment of the \u201csole sovereignty of reason\u201d in a\n\u201ckingdom of the Idea\u201d that would inaugurate a new\nspiritual dispensation. Foreshadowing arguments put forward in his\nfirst book, Feuerbach went on in this letter to emphasize the need for\n\u201cthe I, the self in general, which especially since the\nbeginning of the Christian era, has ruled the world and has thought of\nitself as the only spirit that exists at all [to be] cast down from\nits royal throne\u201d (GW v. 17, Briefwechsel I\n(1817\u20131839), 103\u201308). This, he proposed, would require\nprevailing ways of thinking about time, death, this world and the\nbeyond, individuality, personhood and God to be radically transformed\nwithin and beyond the walls of academia.\n\nFeuerbach made his first attempt to challenge prevailing ways of\nthinking about individuality in his inaugural dissertation, where he\npresented himself as a defender of speculative philosophy against\nthose critics who claim that human reason is restricted to certain\nlimits beyond which all inquiry is futile, and who accuse speculative\nphilosophers of having transgressed these. This criticism, he argued,\npresupposes a conception of reason is a cognitive faculty of the\nindividual thinking subject that is employed as an instrument for\napprehending truths. He aimed to show that this view of the nature of\nreason is mistaken, that reason is one and the same in all thinking\nsubjects, that it is universal and infinite, and that thinking\n(Denken) is not an activity performed by the individual, but\nrather by \u201cthe species\u201d acting through the individual.\n\u201cIn thinking\u201d, Feuerbach wrote, \u201cI am bound together\nwith, or rather, I am one with\u2014indeed, I myself am\u2014all\nhuman beings\u201d (GW I:18).\n\nIn the introduction to Thoughts Feuerbach assumes the role of\ndiagnostician of a spiritual malady by which he claims that modern\nmoral subjects are afflicted. This malady, which he does not name but\nmight have called either individualism or egoism, he takes to be the\ndefining feature of the modern age insofar as this age conceives of\n\u201cthe single human individual for himself in his individuality\n[\u2026] as divine and infinite\u201d (GTU 189/10). The\nprincipal symptom of this malady is the loss of \u201cthe perception\n[Anschauung] of the true totality, of oneness and life in one\nunity\u201d (GTU 264/66). This loss Feuerbach finds\nreflected in three general tendencies of the modern age: 1) the\ntendency to regard human history solely as the history of the opinions\nand actions of individual human subjects, and not as the history of\nhumanity conceived as a single collective agent; 2) the tendency to\nregard nature as a mere aggregate of \u201ccountless single stars,\nstones, plants, animals, elements and things\u201d (GTU\n195/14) whose relations to one another are entirely external and\nmechanical, rather than as an organic whole the internal dynamics of\nwhich are animated by a single all-encompassing vital principle; and\n3) the tendency to conceive of God as a personal agent whose\ninscrutable will, through which the world came into being from nothing\nand is continually directed, is unconstrained by rational\nnecessity.\n\nFeuerbach\u2019s basic objection to the theistic conception of God\nand his relation to creation is that, on it, both are conceived as\nequally spiritless. Rather than consisting of lifeless matter to which\nmotion is first imparted by the purposeful action of an external\nagent, Feuerbach argues that nature contains within itself the\nprinciple of its own development. It exercises \u201cunlimited\ncreative power\u201d by ceaselessly dividing and distinguishing its\nindividual parts from one another. But the immeasurable multiplicity\nof systems within systems that results from this activity constitutes\na single organic totality.\n\n\nNature is ground and principle of itself, or\u2014what is the same\nthing, it exists out of necessity, out of the soul, the essence of\nGod, in which he is one with nature. (GTU 291/86)\n\n\nGod, on this view, is not a skilled mechanic who acts upon the world,\nbut a prolific artist who lives in and through it.\n\nIn Thoughts, Feuerbach further argues that the death of\nfinite individuals is not merely an empirical fact, but also an a\npriori truth that follows from a proper understanding of the\nrelations between the infinite and the finite, and between essence and\nexistence. Nature is the totality of finite individuals existing in\ndistinction from one another in time and space. Since to be a finite\nindividual is not to be any number of other individuals from which one\nis distinct, non-being is not only the condition of individuals before\nthey have begun to exist and after they have ceased to do so, but also\na condition in which they participate by being the determinate\nentities that they are. Thus, being and non-being, or life and death,\nare equally constitutive of the existence of finite entities\nthroughout the entire course of their generation and destruction.\n\nEverything that exists has an essence that is distinct from its\nexistence. Although individuals exist in time and space, their\nessences do not. Essence in general is timeless and unextended.\nFeuerbach nevertheless regards it as a kind of cognitive space in\nwhich individual essences are conceptually contained. Real or\nthree-dimensional space, within which individual things and people\nexist in distinction from one another and in temporal succession, he\nthinks of as essence \u201cin the determination of its\nbeing-outside-of-itself\u201d (GTU 250/55). In his\nbeing-one, Feuerbach argues, God is everything-as-one, and is, as\nsuch, the universal essence in which all finite essences are\n\u201cgrounded, contained and comprehended\n[begriffen]\u201d (GTU 241/48).\n\nIt is by means of Empfindung or sense experience that\nsentient beings are able to distinguish individuals from one another,\nincluding, in some instances, individuals that share the same essence.\nThe form of experience is temporality, which is to say that whatever\nis directly experienced occurs \u201cnow\u201d, or at the moment in\ntime to which we refer as \u201cthe present\u201d. Experience, in\nother words, is essentially transitory, and its contents are\nincommunicable. What we experience are the perceivable features of\nindividual objects. It is through the act of thinking that we are able\nto identify those features through the possession of which different\nindividuals belong to the same species, with the other members of\nwhich they share these essential features in common.\n\nUnlike sense experience, thought is essentially communicable. Thinking\nis not an activity performed by the individual person qua\nindividual. It is the activity of spirit, to which Hegel famously\nreferred in the Phenomenology as \u201c\u2018I\u2019 that\nis \u2018We\u2019 and \u2018We\u2019 that is\n\u2018I\u2019\u201d (Hegel [1807] 1977: 110). Pure spirit is\nnothing but this thinking activity, in which the individual thinker\nparticipates without himself (or herself) being the principal thinking\nagent. That thoughts present themselves to the consciousness of\nindividual thinking subjects in temporal succession is due not to the\nnature of thought itself, but to the nature of individuality, and to\nthe fact that individual thinking subjects, while able to participate\nin the life of spirit, do not cease in doing so to exist as\ncorporeally distinct entities who remain part of nature, and are thus\nnot pure spirit.\n\nA biological species is both identical with, and distinct from, the\nindividual organisms of which it is composed. The species has no\nexistence apart form these individual organisms, and yet the\nperpetuation of the species involves the perpetual generation and\ndestruction of these particular individuals. Similarly,\nSpirit has no existence apart from the existence of individual\nself-conscious persons in whom Spirit becomes conscious of itself\n(i.e., constitutes itself as Spirit). Just as the life of a biological\nspecies only appears in the generation and destruction of individual\norganisms, so the life of Spirit involves the generation and\ndestruction of these individual persons. Viewed in this light,\nFeuerbach maintains, the death of the individual is necessitated by\nthe life of infinite Spirit.\n\n\nDeath is just the withdrawal and departure of your objectivity from\nyour subjectivity, which is eternally living activity and therefore\neverlasting and immortal. (GTU 323/111)\n\n\nArguing thus, he urges his readers to acknowledge and accept the\nirreversibility of their individual mortality so that, in doing so,\nthey might come to an awareness of the immortality of their\nspecies-essence, and thus to knowledge of their true self, which is\nnot the individual person with whom they are accustomed to identifying\nthemselves. They will then be in a position to recognize that, while\n\u201cthe shell of death is hard, its kernel is sweet\u201d\n(GTU 205/20), and that the true belief in immortality is\n\n\na belief in the infinity of Spirit and in the everlasting youth of\nhumanity, in the inexhaustible love and creative power of Spirit, in\nits eternally unfolding itself into new individuals out of the womb of\nits plenitude and granting new beings for the glorification,\nenjoyment, and contemplation of itself. (GTU 357/137)\n\n\nIn light of the emphasis placed in his later works on the pressing\nexistential needs of the embodied individual subject, it should be\nnoted that, during his early idealistic phase, Feuerbach was strongly\ncommitted to a theoretical ideal of philosophy according to which\ncontemplation of, and submersion in, God is the highest\nethical act of which human beings are capable. Whereas, in\nhis later works, Feuerbach would seek to compel philosophy\n\n\nto come down from its divine and self-sufficient blissfulness in\nthought and open its eyes to human misery, (GPZ\n264/3)\n\n\nhere he spoke instead of\n\n\nthe painful whimpering of the sick and the last moans of the dying as\nvictory songs of the species [in which it] celebrates its reality and\nvictorious lordship over the single phenomenon.
