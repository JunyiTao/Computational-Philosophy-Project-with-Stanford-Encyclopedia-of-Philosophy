    "main_text": "Intuitionism || The Creating Subject\n2.2 The Creating Subject\n\nThe two acts of intuitionism do not in themselves exclude a\npsychological interpretation of mathematics. Although Brouwer only\noccasionally addressed this point, it is clear from his writings that\nhe did consider intuitionism to be independent of psychology.\nBrouwer\u2019s introduction of the Creating Subject (Brouwer\n1948) as an idealized mind in which mathematics takes place already\nabstracts away from inessential aspects of human reasoning such as\nlimitations of space and time and the possibility of faulty arguments.\nThus the intersubjectivity problem, which asks for an explanation of\nthe fact that human beings are able to communicate, ceases to exist,\nas there exists only one Creating Subject. In the literature, also the\nname Creative Subject is used for Creating Subject, but here\nBrouwer\u2019s terminology is used. In (Niekus 2010), it is argued\nthat Brouwer\u2019s Creating Subject does not involve an idealized\nmathematician. For a phenomenological analysis of the Creating Subject\nas a transcendental subject in the sense of Husserl see (van Atten\n2007). \n\nBrouwer used arguments that involve the Creating Subject to construct\ncounterexamples to certain intuitionistically unacceptable statements.\nWhere the weak counterexamples, to be discussed below, only show that\ncertain statements cannot, at present, be accepted intuitionistically,\nthe notion of the idealized mind proves certain classical principles\nto be false. An example is given in Section 5.4 on the formalization\nof the notion of the Creating Subject. There it is also explained that\nthe following principle, known as Kripke\u2019s Schema, can\nbe argued for in terms of the Creating Subject:  \n\n\\[\\tag{\\({\\bf KS}\\)}\n\\exists \\alpha(A \\leftrightarrow \\exists n\\, \\alpha(n) = 1). \n\\]\n\n\nIn KS, \\(A\\) ranges over formulas and \\( \\alpha\\) ranges over\nchoice sequences, which are sequences of natural numbers produced by\nthe Creating Subject, who chooses their elements one-by-one. Choice\nsequences and Kripke\u2019s Schema are discussed further in Section\n3.4.\n\nIn most philosophies of mathematics, for example in Platonism,\nmathematical statements are tenseless. In intuitionism truth and\nfalsity have a temporal aspect; an established fact will remain so,\nbut a statement that becomes proven at a certain point in time lacks a\ntruth-value before that point. In said formalization of the notion of\nCreating Subject, which was not formulated by Brouwer but only later\nby others, the temporal aspect of intuitionism is conspicuously\npresent. \n\nImportant as the arguments using the notion of Creating Subject might\nbe for the further understanding of intuitionism as a philosophy of\nmathematics, its role in the development of the field has been less\ninfluential than that of the two acts of intuitionism, which directly\nlead to the mathematical truths Brouwer and those coming after him\nwere willing to accept.\n",
