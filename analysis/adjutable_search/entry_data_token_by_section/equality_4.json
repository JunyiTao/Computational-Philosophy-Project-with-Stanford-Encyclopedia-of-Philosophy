    "main_text": "Principles of Equality and Justice || Moral Equality\n2.3 Moral Equality\n\nUntil the eighteenth century, it was assumed that human beings are\nunequal by nature. This postulate collapsed with the advent of the\nidea of natural right, which assumed a natural order in which all\nhuman beings were equal. Against Plato and Aristotle, the classical\nformula for justice according to which an action is just when it\noffers each individual his or her due took on a substantively\negalitarian meaning in the course of time: everyone deserved the same\ndignity and respect. This is now the widely held conception of\nsubstantive, universal, moral equality. It developed among the Stoics,\nwho emphasized the natural equality of all rational beings, and in\nearly New Testament Christianity, which envisioned that all humans\nwere equal before God, although this principle was not always adhered\nto in the later history of the church. This important idea was also\ntaken up both in the Talmud and in Islam, where it was grounded in\nboth Greek and Hebraic elements. In the modern period, starting in the\nseventeenth century, the dominant idea was of natural equality in the\ntradition of natural law and social contract theory. Hobbes (1651)\npostulated that in their natural condition, individuals possess equal\nrights, because over time they have the same capacity to do each other\nharm. Locke (1690) argued that all human beings have the same natural\nright to both (self-)ownership and freedom. Rousseau (1755) declared\nsocial inequality to be the result of a decline from the natural\nequality that characterized our harmonious state of nature, a decline\ncatalyzed by the human urge for perfection, property and possessions\n(Dahrendorf 1962). For Rousseau (1755, 1762), the resulting inequality\nand rule of violence can only be overcome by binding individual\nsubjectivity to a common civil existence and popular sovereignty. In\nKant\u2019s moral philosophy (1785), the categorical imperative formulates\nthe equality postulate of universal human worth. His transcendental\nand philosophical reflections on autonomy and self-legislation lead to\na recognition of the same freedom for all rational beings as the sole\nprinciple of human rights (Kant 1797, p. 230). Such Enlightenment\nideas stimulated the great modern social movements and revolutions,\nand were taken up in modern constitutions and declarations of human\nrights. During the French Revolution, equality, along with freedom and\nfraternity, became a basis of the D\u00e9claration des droits de\nl\u2019homme et du citoyen of 1789.\n\nThe principle that holds that human beings, despite their differences,\nare to be regarded as one another\u2019s equals, is often also called\n\u2018human equality\u2019 or \u2018basic equality\u2019 or\n\u2018equal worth\u2019 or \u2018human dignity\u2019 (William\n1962, Vlastos 1962, Kateb 2014, Waldron 2017, Rosen 2018). Whether\nthese terms are synonyms is a matter of interpretation, but\n\u201cthey cluster together to form a powerful body of\nprinciple\u201d (Waldron 2017, p. 3).\n\nThis fundamental idea of equal respect for all persons and of the\nequal worth or equal dignity of all human beings (Vlastos 1962) is\nwidely accepted (Carter 2011, but see also Steinhoff 2015). In a\nperiod in which there is not agreement across the members of a complex\nsociety to any one metaphysical, religious, or traditional view\n(Habermas 1983, p. 53, 1992, pp. 39\u201344), it appears impossible to\npeacefully reach a general agreement on common political aims without\naccepting that persons must be treated as equals. As a result, moral\nequality constitutes the \u2018egalitarian plateau\u2019 for all\ncontemporary political theories (Kymlicka 1990, p. 5).\n\nFundamental equality means that persons are alike in important\nrelevant and specified respects alone, and not that they are all\ngenerally the same or can be treated in the same way (Nagel 1991). In\na now commonly posed distinction, stemming from Dworkin (1977, p.\n227), moral equality can be understood as prescribing treatment of\npersons as equals, i.e., with equal concern and respect, and not the\noften implausible principle of providing all persons with equal\ntreatment. Recognizing that human beings are all equally individual\ndoes not mean treating them uniformly in any respects other than those\nin which they clearly have a moral claim to be treated alike.\n\nDisputes arise, of course, concerning what these claims amount to and\nhow they should be resolved. Philosophical debates are concerned with\nthe kind of equal treatment normatively required when we mutually\nconsider ourselves persons with equal dignity. The principle of moral\nequality is too abstract and needs to be made concrete if we are to\narrive at a clear moral standard. Nevertheless, no conception of just\nequality can be deduced from the notion of moral equality. Rather, we\nfind competing philosophical conceptions of equal treatment serving as\ninterpretations of moral equality. These need to be assessed according\nto their degree of fidelity to the deeper ideal of moral equality\n(Kymlicka 1990, p. 44).\n",
