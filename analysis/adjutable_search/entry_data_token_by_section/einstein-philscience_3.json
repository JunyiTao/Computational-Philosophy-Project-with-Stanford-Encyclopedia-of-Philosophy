Univocalness in the Theoretical Representation of Nature\n\nIn the physics and philosophy of science literature of the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the principle according to\nwhich scientific theorizing should strive for a univocal\nrepresentation of nature was widely and well known under the name that\nit was given in the title of a widely-cited essay by Joseph Petzoldt,\n\u201cThe Law of Univocalness\u201d [\u201cDas Gesetz der\nEindeutigkeit\u201d] (Petzoldt 1895). An indication that the map of\nphilosophical positions was drawn then in a manner very different from\ntoday is to found in the fact that this principle found favor among\nboth anti-metaphysical logical empiricists, such as Carnap, and\nneo-Kantians, such as Cassirer. It played a major role in debates over\nthe ontology of general relativity and was an important part of the\nbackground to the development of the modern concept of categoricity in\nformal semantics (for more on the history, influence, and demise of\nthe principle of univocalness, see Howard 1992 and 1996). One can find\nno more ardent and consistent champion of the principle than\nEinstein.\n\nThe principle of univocalness should not be mistaken for a denial of\nthe underdetermination thesis. The latter asserts that a multiplicity\nof theories can equally well account for a given body of empirical\nevidence, perhaps even the infinity of all possible evidence in the\nextreme, Quinean version of the thesis. The principle of univocalness\nasserts (in a somewhat anachronistic formulation) that any one theory,\neven any one among a set of empirically equivalent theories, should\nprovide a univocal representation of nature by determining for itself\nan isomorphic set of models. The unambiguous determination of theory\nchoice by evidence is not the same thing as the univocal determination\nof a class of models by a theory.\n\nThe principle of univocalness played a central role in Einstein\u2019s\nstruggles to formulate the general theory of relativity. When, in\n1913, Einstein wrongly rejected a fully generally covariant theory of\ngravitation, he did so in part because he thought, wrongly, that\ngenerally covariant field equations failed the test of univocalness.\nMore specifically, he reasoned wrongly that for a region of spacetime\ndevoid of matter and energy\u2014a \u201chole\u201d\u2014generally\ncovariant field equations permit the construction of two different\nsolutions, different in the sense that, in general, for spacetime\npoints inside the hole, they assign different values of the metric\ntensor to one and the same point (for more on the history of this\nepisode, see Stachel 1980 and Norton 1984). But Einstein\u2019s \u201chole\nargument\u201d is wrong, and his own diagnosis of the error in 1915\nrests again, ironically, on a deployment of the principle of\nunivocalness. What Einstein realized in 1915 was that, in 1913, he was\nwrongly assuming that a coordinate chart sufficed to fix the identity\nof spacetime manifold points. The application of a coordinate chart\ncannot suffice to individuate manifold points precisely because a\ncoordinate chart is not an invariant labeling scheme, whereas\nunivocalness in the representation of nature requires such invariance\n(see Howard and Norton 1993 and Howard 1999 for further\ndiscussion).\n\nHere is how Einstein explained his change of perspective in a letter\nto Paul Ehrenfest of 26 December 1915, just a few weeks after the\npublication of the final, generally covariant formulation of the\ngeneral theory of relativity:\n\nIn \u00a712 of my work of last year, everything is correct (in the\nfirst three paragraphs) up to that which is printed with emphasis at\nthe end of the third paragraph. From the fact that the two systems\n\\(G(x)\\) and \\(G'(x)\\), referred to\nthe same reference system, satisfy the conditions of the grav. field,\nno contradiction follows with the univocalness of events. That which\nwas apparently compelling in these reflections founders immediately,\nif one considers that\n\n\nthe reference system signifies nothing real\nthat the (simultaneous) realization of two different\n\\(g\\)-systems (or better, two different grav. fields) in the same\nregion of the continuum is impossible according to the nature of the\ntheory.\n\n\nIn place of \u00a712, the following reflections must appear. The\nphysically real in the universe of events (in contrast to that which\nis dependent upon the choice of a reference system) consists in\nspatiotemporal coincidences.* [Footnote *: and in nothing\nelse!] Real are, e.g., the intersections of two different world lines,\nor the statement that they do not intersect. Those statements\nthat refer to the physically real therefore do not founder on any\nunivocal coordinate transformation. If two systems of the\n\\(g_{\\mu v}\\) (or in\ngeneral the variables employed in the description of the world) are so\ncreated that one can obtain the second from the first through mere\nspacetime transformation, then they are completely equivalent. For\nthey have all spatiotemporal point coincidences in common, i.e.,\neverything that is observable.\n\nThese reflections show at the same time how natural the demand for\ngeneral covariance is. (CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc. 173)\n\n\nEinstein\u2019s new point of view, according to which the physically real\nconsists exclusively in that which can be constructed on the basis of\nspacetime coincidences, spacetime points, for example, being regarded\nas intersections of world lines, is now known as the\n\u201cpoint-coincidence argument.\u201d Einstein might have been\ninspired by a paper by the young mathematician Erich Kretschmann\n(Howard and Norton 1993; cf. Giovanelli 2013) or possibly by a\nconversation with Schlick (Engler and Renn, 2017). Spacetime\ncoincidences play this privileged ontic role because they are\ninvariant and, thus, univocally determined. Spacetime\ncoordinates lack such invariance, a circumstance that\nEinstein thereafter repeatedly formulated as the claim that space and\ntime \u201cthereby lose the last vestige of physical reality\u201d\n(see, for example, Einstein to Ehrenfest, 5 January 1916, CPAE, Vol. 8,\nDoc. 180).\n\nOne telling measure of the philosophical importance of Einstein\u2019s new\nperspective on the ontology of spacetime is the fact that Schlick\ndevoted his first book, Raum und Zeit in den gegenw\u00e4rtigen\nPhysik (1917), a book for which Einstein had high praise (see\nHoward 1984 and 1999). But what most interested Einstein was Schlick\u2019s\ndiscussion of the reality concept. Schlick argued that Mach was wrong\nto regard only the elements of sensation as real. Spacetime events,\nindividuated invariantly as spacetime coincidences, have as much or\nmore right to be taken as real, precisely because of the univocal\nmanner of their determination. Einstein wholeheartedly agreed, though\nhe ventured the above-quoted suggestion that one should distinguish\nthe two kinds of reality\u2014that of the elements and that of the\nspacetime events\u2014on the ground that if \u201ctwo different\npeoples\u201d pursued physics independently of one another they were\nfated to agree about the elements but would almost surely produce\ndifferent theoretical constructions at the level of the spacetime\nevent ontology. Note, again, that underdetermination is not a failure\nof univocalness. Different though they will be, each people\u2019s\ntheoretical construction of an event ontology would be expected to be\nunivocal.\n\nSchlick, of course, went on to become the founder of the Vienna\nCircle, a leading figure in the development of logical empiricism, a\nchampion of verificationism. That being so, an important question\narises about Schlick\u2019s interpretation of Einstein on the univocal\ndetermination of spacetime events as spacetime coincidences. The\nquestion is this: Do such univocal coincidences play such a privileged\nrole because of their reality or because of their observability.\nClearly the former\u2014the reality of that which is univocally\ndetermined\u2014is important. But are univocal spacetime coincidences\nreal because, thanks to their invariance, they are observable? Or is\ntheir observability consequent upon their invariant reality? Einstein,\nhimself, repeatedly stressed the observable character of spacetime\ncoincidences, as in the 26 December 1915 letter to Ehrenfest quoted\nabove (for additional references and a fuller discussion, see Howard\n 1999).[2]\n\nSchlick, still a self-described realist in 1917, was clear about the\nrelationship between observability and reality. He distinguished\nmacroscopic coincidences in the field of our sense experience, to\nwhich he does accord a privileged and foundational epistemic status,\nfrom the microscopic point coincidences that define an ontology of\nspacetime manifold points. Mapping the former onto the latter is, for\nSchlick, an important part of the business of confirmation, but the\nreality of the spacetime manifold points is in no way consequent upon\ntheir observability. Indeed, how, strictly speaking, can one even talk\nof the observation of infinitesimal spacetime coincidences of\nthe kind encountered in the intersection of two world lines? In fact,\nthe order of implication goes the other way: Spacetime events\nindividuated as spacetime coincidences are real because they are\ninvariant, and such observability as they might possess is consequent\nupon their status as invariant bits of physical reality. For Einstein,\nand for Schlick in 1917, understanding the latter\u2014physical\nreality\u2014is the goal of physical theory.\n",
