    "main_text": "The Minimal State versus Individualist Anarchism || The Challenge of Individualist Anarchism\n3.1 The Challenge of Individualist Anarchism\n\nNozick expects that it will take a considerable effort to answer the\nindividualist anarchist precisely because this form of anti-statism is\nitself rooted in the moral rights that Nozick proclaims. Indeed,\nimmediately following his ascription to individuals of pre-political,\npre-contractual, negative moral rights Nozick tells us that these\nrights may so extensively limit the permissible use of force that no\nroom is left for a morally acceptable state.\n\n\nSo strong and far-reaching are these rights that they raise the\nquestion of what, if anything the state and its officials may do. How\nmuch room do individual rights leave for the state? (ix)\n\n\nTo be clear about Nozick\u2019s response, we first need to be clear\nabout what alternative structure for the protection of rights is\nenvisioned by the individualist anarchist. Second, we need to clearly\nidentify the precise challenge that Nozick needs to overcome.\n\nFirst, then, Nozick and the individualist anarchist agree that it is\none thing for individuals to have rights and another thing for them to\nhave rights to the protection of their rights. It is one thing to have\na right against others that they not aggress against one; it is\nanother thing to have rights against others that they protect one\nagainst aggression. Being a positive right, the right to protection\nagainst violations of one\u2019s rights must arise through some\nspecial interaction between the agent who acquires the right and the\nagent who acquires the correlative obligation. The most common kind of\nspecial interaction that gives rise to one agent having a positive\nright against another is contract. However, the individualist\nanarchist and Nozick agree that there has never been any general\nsocial contract whereby individuals at large acquire from one another\npositive rights to the protection of their pre-contractual rights.\nAnd, \u201c\u2026 tacit consent isn\u2019t worth the paper\nit\u2019s not written on\u201d (287). Hence, if people are to\nacquire rights to have their rights protected, they must (at least for\nthe most part) go shopping for them.\n\nMoreover, the individualist anarchist asserts\u2014and Nozick is\nstrongly disposed to agree\u2014that shoppers for any sort of service\nwill do best when there is a competitive market in the supply of that\nsort of service. Competition among good-willed providers of the\nservice of rights protection will induce lower prices and/or higher\nquality rights protection\u2014including protection against\n\u201coutlaw\u201d agencies that seek to assist or protect rights\nviolators. The interest of good-willed purchasers of rights protection\nin non-violent dispute resolution will press competing suppliers of\nrights protection to join in agreements that more sharply define the\nboundaries of their clients and establish procedures for resolving\ndisputes among them. Any protective agency that is not part of a\nnetwork of established conflict diminishing agreements and resolution\nprocedures will be at a huge competitive disadvantage. Nozick refers\nto the resulting network as the dominant protective association; and\nhe treats the question of whether the minimal state can arise without\nviolating rights as a matter of whether such a dominant protective\nassociation can develop into a minimal state without violating\nrights.\n\nSecond, anarchists like Rothbard assert that the creation and\nmaintenance of even the minimal state will violate rights in two\nfundamental ways. First, even the minimal state will arise through and\nsustain itself through imposed taxation. Second, even the minimal\nstate will arise through and sustain itself through the coercive\nsuppression or control of competing protective agencies. However, the\nminimal state that Nozick seeks to defend is simply not subject to the\nfirst of these challenges. For, despite some ill-chosen language that\nsuggests the contrary (26\u20137), Nozick\u2019s minimal state does\nnot impose taxation\u2014even to fund its rights protective\n activities.[17]\n Nozick\u2019s minimal state does prohibit individuals who interact\nwith its clients from becoming clients of competing agencies (that are\nnot subject to supervision and constraint by the minimal state).\nHowever, it does not require anyone to subscribe to its services.\nPrincipled anarchists and even individuals who hope to free-ride on\nthe minimal state\u2019s overall suppression of rights\n violations[18]\n are morally at liberty to take their chances.\n\nHowever, to be a state\u2014even a minimal state\u2014an\ninstitution has to have some sort of monopoly on the use of coercive\nforce over a sufficiently large territory or set of people. To rise to\nstatehood within a given territory or with respect to a set of people,\na protective agency must fairly successfully fulfill its aspiration to\nbe the suppressor of other actors who seek to engage in rights\nviolating force and (at least) to be the controller of other actors\nwho seek to engage in rights protecting force. Hence, to rise to\nstatehood, a protective agency must either shut down or exercise\nsubstantial control over other non-outlaw agencies. In short,\nit seems that it must act toward its non-outlaw competitors in ways\nthat Nozick would declare to be impermissible among competitors in the\ndelivery of any other sort of service. Nozick must attempt to meet the\nanarchist\u2019s second challenge by arguing that the dominant\nprotective agency\u2019s establishment of a monopoly in protective\nservices differs markedly from the standard suppression or control of\ncompetitors.\n",
