    "main_text": "Motion\n3. Motion\n\nAgain the proper subject matter of physics is body inasmuch as it is\nmovable. We have just looked at Avicenna\u2019s conception of body\nand associated issues. I now turn to his theory of motion, followed by\ndiscussions of some of the conditions necessary for motion, like time\nand place. Avicenna\u2019s theory of motion is best understood\nagainst the background of Aristotle\u2019s account of motion and\ndevelopments surrounding that account that emerged in the later Greek\nworld. (For detailed discussions of Avicenna\u2019s theory of motion\nsee Hasnawi 2001; McGinnis 2006a; and Ahmed 2016).\n",
