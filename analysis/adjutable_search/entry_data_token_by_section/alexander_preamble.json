    "main_text": "\n\nAustralian-born philosopher Samuel Alexander (1859\u20131938) was a\nprominent figure in early twentieth-century British philosophy. He is\nbest known for advancing \u201cBritish Emergentism\u201d, a movement\nthat held mind \u201cemerges\u201d from matter. Alexander rejected\nidealism, and accordingly can be labelled a \u201cnew\nrealist\u201d alongside the likes of Bertrand Russell; however,\nunlike other new realists, Alexander maintained close ties with\nBritish idealism throughout his career, and his ontology arguably\nbears similarities to the Absolute Idealism of F. H.\nBradley. Alexander\u2019s mature metaphysical system is set out in\nhis greatest work Space, Time, and Deity (1920). Alexander\nconceives the world as a hierarchy of levels: space and time sit at\nthe lowest level, and through a process of emergence give rise to the\nlevels of matter, life, mind, and deity. These levels are pervaded by\n\u201ccategorial\u201d features of reality, such as substance,\nuniversals, and causality. Although Alexander is primarily known as a\nmetaphysician, he wrote extensively on many other philosophical\ntopics, including the history of philosophy, ethics, aesthetics, and\nthe philosophy of religion. Alexander spent most of his professional\ncareer at the University of Manchester, where he supported various\nmoves in education and feminism. On his death, Alexander left his\nphilosophical papers and correspondence to the John Rylands Library at\nManchester, and this collection constitutes an important philosophic\narchive of the period.\n\nAlexander\u2019s work was widely celebrated during his lifetime. J. H.\nMuirhead (1939: 3) wrote that, after Bradley\u2019s death in 1924,\nAlexander was \u201cthe leading figure in British philosophy, and whom\nall schools, whatever their differences, were delighted to\nhonour as their chief\u201d. John Laird (1939: 61\u20135)\ndescribed Space, Time, and Deity as \u201cthe boldest\nadventure in detailed speculative metaphysics\u201d since\nHobbes. Although he never founded a school of philosophy,\nAlexander is credited with having an influence on figures as diverse\nas new realists Laird, C. D. Broad, and Edwin B. Holt; the\nprocess philosopher A. N. Whitehead; John Anderson, \u201cfather\nof Australian philosophy\u201d, and his school at Sydney; British\nidealists May Sinclair and Hilda Oakeley; and philosopher of\nhistory R. G. Collingwood. A number of studies were produced on\nAlexander\u2019s work in the mid-twentieth century, but it then saw a\nperiod of neglect. Over the last decade or so, interest has increased,\nas indicated by Fisher\u2019s (2021) collection Marking the\nCentenary of Samuel Alexander\u2019s Space, Time and Deity.\n",
