    "main_text": "Conceptions of Distributive Equality: Equality of What? || Responsibility and Luck-Egalitarianism\n3.6 Responsibility and Luck-Egalitarianism\n\nOnly some egalitarians hold inequality to be bad per se. Most of\ntoday\u2019s egalitarians are pluralistic, recognizing other values besides\nequality. So called luck-egalitarians regard the moral significance of\nchoice and responsibility as one of the most important values besides\nequality (for an overview over the debate see Lippert-Rasmussen 2015).\nThey hold that it is bad \u2013 unjust or unfair \u2013 for some to\nbe worse off than others through no fault or choice of their own\n(Temkin 1993, 13) and therefore strive to eliminate involuntary\ndisadvantages, for which the sufferer cannot be held responsible\n(Cohen 1989, 916).\n\nThe principle of responsibility provides a central normative vantage\npoint for deciding on which grounds one might justify which\ninequality. The positive formulation of the responsibility\nprinciple requires an assumption of personal responsibility and holds\nthat inequalities which are the result of self-chosen options are\njust. (See above all Dworkin, 1981b, p. 311; contra: Anderson, 1999.)\nUnequal portions of social goods are thus fair when they result from\nthe decisions and intentional actions of those concerned. Individuals\nmust accept responsibility for the costs of their decisions. Persons\nare themselves responsible for certain inequalities that result from\ntheir voluntary decisions, and they deserve no compensation for such\ninequalities, aside from minimal provisions in cases of dire need (see\nbelow). In its negative formulation, the responsibility\nprinciple holds that inequalities which are not the result of\nself-chosen options are to be rejected as unjust; persons\ndisadvantaged in this way deserve compensation. That which one can do\nnothing about, or for which one is not responsible, cannot constitute\na relevant criterion. Still, the initial assumption remains an\nascription of responsibility, and each individual case requires close\nscrutiny: one is responsible and accountable unless there is an\nadequate reason for being considered otherwise (but cf. Stemplowska\n2013 for a different interpretation)..\n\nIf advantages or disadvantages that are due to arbitrary and unearned\ndifferences are unfair, this holds for social circumstances as well as\nnatural endowments. The reasons favoring an exclusion of features like\nskin-color, size, sex, and place of origin as primarily discriminative\napply equally to other natural human qualities, like intelligence,\nappearance, physical strength, and so forth. The kind and the extent\nof one\u2019s natural abilities are due to a lottery of nature; considered\nfrom a moral standpoint, their distribution is purely arbitrary\n(Rawls, 1971, \u00a7 48). To sum up: natural and social endowment must\nnot count, and personal intentions and voluntary decisions should\ncount. Thus, a given social order is just when it equalizes as much as\npossible, and in a normatively tenable way, all personal disadvantages\nfor which an individual is not responsible, and accords individuals\nthe capacity to bear the consequences of their decisions and actions,\nas befits their capacity for autonomy.\n\nObjections to all versions of \u201cbrute-luck egalitarianism\u201d\ncome from two sides. Some authors criticize its in their view\nunjustified or excessively radical rejection of merit: The\nluck-egalitarian thesis of desert only being justifiably acknowledged\nif it involves desert \u201call the way down\u201d (Nozick 1974, p.\n225) not only destroys the classical, everyday principle of desert,\nsince everything has a basis that we ourselves have not created. In\nthe eyes of such critics, along with the merit-principle this argument\nalso destroys our personal identity, since we can no longer accredit\nourselves with our own capacities and accomplishments. (Cf. the texts\nin Pojman & McLeod 1998, Olsaretti 2003.) Other authors consider\nthe criterion for responsibility to be too strong, indeed inhuman (or\n\u201charsh\u201d) in its consequences, since human beings\nresponsible for their own misery would (supposedly) be left alone with\ntheir misery (Anderson 1999, also MacLeod 1998, Scheffler 2003, Wolff\n1998, Fleurbaey 1995, Voigt 2007, Eyal 2017, Olsaretti 2009,\nStemplowska 2009). However, pluralistic egalitarians should be able\nto argue that there are special cases, in which people are so badly\noff that they should be helped, even if they got into the miserable\nsituation through their own fault. But even when people are in\nterrible situations, which did not arise through their own fault\n(\u2018bad brute luck\u2019) \u2013 for instance, when they are\ndisabled from birth \u2013 and egalitarians therefore have reasons to\nhelp them, these reasons are supposedly stigmatizing, since in these\ncases the principles of distribution would be based on pity. In these\ncases, political institutions have to take certain decisions \u2013\nfor example, in which category a particular case of distress should be\nplaced \u2013 and gather relevant information on their\ncitizens. Against such a procedure, one could object that it subjects\nthe citizens to the tutelage of the state and harms their private\nsphere (Anderson 1999, also Hayek 1960: 85\u2013102).\n",
