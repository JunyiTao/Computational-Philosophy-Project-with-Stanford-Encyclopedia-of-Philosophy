    "main_text": "Conceptions of Authenticity || Kierkegaard and Heidegger\n3.1 Kierkegaard and Heidegger\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s work on authenticity and his suggestion that each\nof us is to \u201cbecome what one is\u201d (1992 [1846]: 130), is\nbest seen as linked to his critical stance towards a certain social\nreality and a certain essentialist trend in philosophical and\nscientific thought. On the one hand, he (1962 [1846]) condemned\naspects of his contemporary social world, claiming that many people\nhave come to function as merely place-holders in a society that\nconstantly levels down possibilities to the lowest common denominator.\nIn more contemporary terms, we can say that Kierkegaard provides a\ncriticism of modern society as causing \u201cinauthenticity\u201d.\nLiving in a society characterized by such \u201cmassification\u201d\nlead to what he refers to as widespread \u201cdespair\u201d that\ncomes to the fore as spiritlessness, denial, and defiance. On the\nother hand, he rejected the view that a human being should be regarded\nas an object, as a substance with certain essential attributes. Rather\nthan being an item among others, Kierkegaard proposes to understand\nthe self in relational terms: \u201cThe self is a relation that\nrelates itself to itself\u2026\u201d (Kierkegaard 1980 [1849]:13).\nThis relation consists in the unfolding project of taking what we find\nourselves with as beings in the world and imparting some meaning or\nconcrete identity to our own life course. Thus, the self is defined by\nconcrete expressions through which one manifests oneself in\nthe world and thereby constitutes one\u2019s identity over time. In\nKierkegaard\u2019s view, \u201cbecoming what one is\u201d and\nevading despair and hollowness is not a matter of solitary\nintrospection, but rather a matter of passionate commitment to a\nrelation to something outside oneself that bestows one\u2019s life\nwith meaning. For Kierkegaard, as a religious thinker, this ultimate\ncommitment was his defining relation to God. The idea is that\npassionate care about something outside ourselves gives diachronic\ncoherence in our lives and provides the basis for the narrative unity\nof the self (Davenport 2012).\n\nThe most familiar conception of \u201cauthenticity\u201d comes to us\nmainly from Heidegger\u2019s Being and Time of 1927. The\nword we translate as \u2018authenticity\u2019 is actually a\nneologism invented by Heidegger, the word Eigentlichkeit,\nwhich comes from an ordinary term, eigentlich, meaning\n\u2018really\u2019 or \u2018truly\u2019, but is built on the stem\neigen, meaning \u2018own\u2019 or \u2018proper\u2019. So\nthe word might be more literally translated as\n\u2018ownedness\u2019, or \u2018being owned\u2019, or even\n\u2018being one\u2019s own\u2019, implying the idea of owning up to\nand owning what one is and does (for a stimulating recent\ninterpretation, see McManus 2019). Nevertheless, the word\n\u2018authenticity\u2019 has become closely associated with\nHeidegger as a result of early translations of Being and Time\ninto English, and was adopted by Sartre and Beauvoir as well as by\nexistentialist therapists and cultural theorists who followed\n them.[1]\n\nHeidegger\u2019s conception of ownedness as the most fully realized\nhuman form of life emerges from his view of what it is to be a human\nbeing. This conception of human Dasein echoes\nKierkegaard\u2019s description of a \u201cself\u201d. On\nHeidegger\u2019s account, Dasein is not a type of object among others\nin the totality of what is on hand in the universe. Instead, human\nbeing is a \u201crelation of being\u201d, a relation that\nobtains between what one is at any moment (the immediacy of the\nconcrete present as it has evolved) and what one can and will be as\nthe temporally extended unfolding or happening of life into\nan open realm of possibilities. To say that human being is a relation\nis to say that, in living out our lives, we always care about\nwho and what we are. Heidegger expresses this by saying that, for each\nof us, our being (what our lives will amount to overall) is always\nat issue. This \u201cbeing at stake\u201d or \u201cbeing\nin question for oneself\u201d is made concrete in the specific stands\nwe take\u2014that is, in the roles we enact\u2014over the course of\nour lives. It is because our being (our identity) is in question for\nus that we are always taking a stand on who we are. Since the German\nword for \u2018understanding\u2019, Verstehen, is\netymologically derived from the idea of \u2018taking a stand\u2019,\nHeidegger can call the projection into the future by which we shape\nour identity \u2018understanding\u2019. And because any stand one\ntakes is inescapably \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d, understanding\ncarries with it some degree of competence in coping with the world\naround us. An understanding of being in general is therefore built\ninto human agency.\n\nTo the extent that all our actions contribute to realizing an\noverarching project or set of projects, our active lives can be seen\nas embodying a life-project of some sort. On Heidegger\u2019s view,\nwe exist for the sake of ourselves: enacting roles and\nexpressing character traits contribute to realizing some image of what\nit is to be human in our own cases. Existence has a directedness or\npurposiveness that imparts a degree of connection to our life stories.\nFor the most part, having such a life-plan requires very little\nconscious formulation of goals or deliberation about means. It results\nfrom our competence in being members of a historical culture that we\nhave mastered to a great extent in growing up into a shared world.\nThis tacit \u201cpre-understanding\u201d makes possible our familiar\ndwelling with things and others in the familiar, everyday world.\n\nHeidegger holds that all possibilities of concrete understanding and\naction are made possible by a background of shared practices opened up\nby the social context in which we find ourselves, by what he calls the\n\u2018They\u2019 (das Man). Far from it being the case that\nsocial existence is something alien to and opposed to our humanity,\nHeidegger holds that we are always essentially and inescapably social\nbeings. As he says,\n\n\nThey itself prescribes that way of interpreting the world that lies\nclosest. Dasein is for the sake of the They in an everyday\nmanner\u2026 In terms of the They, and as the They, I am\n\u2018given\u2019 proximally to \u2018myself\u2019\u2026. (1962\n[1927]: 167, translation modified)\n\n\nTo be a teacher, for instance, I must adopt (and perhaps blend) some\nset of the ready-made styles of classroom presentation and of dealing\nwith students laid out in advance by existing norms and conventions of\nprofessional conduct.\n\nTo say that we are always the They is not to say we are automata,\nhowever. Heidegger suggests that even in the bland conformism of\n\u201caverage everydayness\u201d we are constantly making choices\nthat reflect our understanding of who we are. Nevertheless, in average\neverydayness, we are as a rule adrift, acting as one of the\n\u201cherd\u201d or \u201ccrowd\u201d\u2014a form of life\nHeidegger calls \u201cfalling\u201d (Verfallen). Heidegger\n(1962 [1927]: 220) emphasizes that calling this way of living\n\u201cfalling\u201d does not imply that it is \u201ca bad or\ndeplorable ontical property of which, perhaps, more advanced stages of\nhuman culture might be able to rid themselves\u201d (1962 [1927]:\n220). On the contrary, since there is no exit from the social\nworld\u2014since it is the \u201conly game in town\u201d\u2014it\nplays a positive role in creating the background of shared\nintelligibility that lets us be fully human in the first place.\nNevertheless, Heidegger is aware that there is something deeply\nproblematic about this falling mode of existence. In \u201cdoing what\none does\u201d, he suggests, we fail to own up to who we are. We do\nnot take over our own choices as our own and, as a result, we are not\nreally the authors of our own lives. To the extent that our lives are\nunowned or disowned, existence is inauthentic (uneigentlich),\nnot our own (eigen).\n\nOur condition as They-selves is one of dispersal, distraction and\nforgetfulness. But this \u201cdownward plunge\u201d captures only\none aspect of Dasein, Heidegger says. In order to be able to realize\nthe capacity for authenticity, one must undergo a personal\ntransformation, one that tears us away from falling. This is possible\nonly given certain fundamental insights arising in a life. The first\nmajor shift can occur when one experiences an intense bout of anxiety.\nIn anxiety, the familiar world that seemed to assure one\u2019s\nsecurity suddenly breaks down, and in this world-collapse one finds\nthat the significance of things is \u201ccompletely lacking\u201d\n(1962 [1927]: 186). One finds oneself alone, with no worldly supports\nfor one\u2019s existence. In anxiety, Dasein encounters itself as an\nindividual, ultimately alone. In Heidegger\u2019s words,\n\u201cAnxiety individualizes Dasein and thus discloses it as\n\u2018solus ipse\u2019\u201d (1962 [1927]: 188). The\nsecond transformative event is the encounter with one\u2019s\n\u201cownmost\u201d possibility, the possibility of death as the\npossible loss of all possibilities. In facing our own finitude, we\nfind that we are always future-directed happenings or projects, where\nwhat is crucial to that ongoing forward movement is not its\nactualization of possibilities, but the \u201cHow\u201d with which\none undertakes one\u2019s life. Heidegger tries to envision a way of\nlife he calls anticipatory running-forward\n(Vorlaufen) as a life that clear-sightedly and intensely\ncarries out its projects, no matter what they may be. The third\ntransformative event is hearing the call of conscience. What\nconscience calls out to us is the fact that we are\n\u201cguilty\u201d in the German sense of that word, which means\nthat we have a debt (Schuld) and are responsible for\nourselves. Conscience tells us that we are falling short of what we\ncan be, and that we are obliged to take up the task of living with\nresoluteness and full engagement. Such resoluteness is seen clearly in\nthe case of vocational commitments, where one has heard a calling and\nfeels pulled toward pursuing that\n calling.[2]\n\nThe three \u201cexistentialia\u201d that structure Dasein\u2019s\nBeing-in-the-world make up the \u201cformal existential totality of\nDasein\u2019s structural whole\u201d, what Heidegger calls\ncare. To be Dasein, an entity must have some sense of what it\nis \u201ccoming toward\u201d (Zu-kunft, the German for\n\u201cfuture\u201d), what has \u201ccome before\u201d (what is\n\u201cpassed\u201d, Vorbei), and what one is dealing with\nin one\u2019s current situation (\u201cmaking present\u201d). The\ndefining characteristics of Dasein\u2019s potentiality-for-Being are\ndisplayed in the transformative events that lead to the possibility of\nbeing authentic (eigentlich, as we saw, from the stem meaning\n\u201cproper\u201d or \u201cown\u201d). When Dasein confronts and\ngrasps its authentic possibility of being, it becomes possible to see\nthe whole of Dasein, including both its being as a They-self\nand as authentic being-one\u2019s-self. \u201cDasein is\nauthentically itself in [its] primordial\nindividualization\u201d, where the \u201cconstancy\n[St\u00e4ndigkeit] of the Self \u2026 gets\nclarified\u201d (1962 [1927]: 322). What defines the wholeness and\nunity of Dasein is determined not by an underlying substance (e.g.,\nthe sub-ject, that which underlies), but by the \u201csteadiness and\nsteadfastness\u201d (best\u00e4ndigen Standfestigkeit, ibid)\nof authenticity.\n\nThe key to understanding authenticity lies, as we have seen, in the\ncharacterization of Dasein\u2019s being as a relation\nbetween two aspects or dimensions making up human existence. On the\none hand, we find ourselves thrown into a world and a\nsituation not of our own making, already disposed by moods and\nparticular commitments, with a past behind us that constrains our\nchoices. With respect to this dimension of human life, we are\ngenerally absorbed in practical affairs, taking care of business,\nstriving to get things done as they crop up from time to time. This\n\u201cbeing-in-a-situation\u201d naturally inclines us to everyday\nfalling as Heidegger describes it.\n\nAt the same time, however, to be human is to be underway toward\nachieving ends that are understood as integral to one\u2019s\noverarching life-project. My actions at any moment, though typically\naimed at accomplishing tasks laid out by the demands of circumstances,\nare also cumulatively creating me as a person of a particular sort. In\nthis sense, my futural projection as \u201cunderstanding\u201d has\nthe structure of being a projection onto one\u2019s ownmost\npossibility of being. So, for example, when I attend a boring\nparent/teacher conference, I do so as part of handling my current\nduties. But this act is also part of being a parent insofar\nas it contributes to determining \u201cthat for the sake of\nwhich\u201d I understand myself as existing. Given this distinction\nbetween current means/ends strategic actions and long-range\nlife-defining undertakings, it is possible to see that there are two\nsenses of freedom in play in Heidegger\u2019s account of human\nexistence. There is freedom in the humdrum sense of doing what I\nchoose to do under ordinary conditions, a freedom Heidegger presumably\ninterprets in an agent-libertarian way. But there is also freedom in\nan ethically more robust sense. In addition to choosing courses of\naction among options, Dasein is capable of \u201cchoosing to choose a\nkind of being-one\u2019s-self\u201d (1962 [1927]: 314) through its\nongoing constitution of that identity for the sake of which it exists.\nThus, I attend the parent/teacher conference and behave in a\nparticular way because I care about being a parent and a citizen of a\nparticular sort. I understand this stance as having repercussions for\nmy life as a whole, and I grasp the need for resoluteness in\nholding steady to undertakings of this sort if I am to shape my\nidentity in the way I can care about. For Heidegger, the resolute\ncommitment that is made concrete and defined in one\u2019s day-to-day\nactions is what imparts steadiness and steadfastness\nto a life. It is also the condition for being responsible for\none\u2019s own existence: \u201cOnly so can [one] be\nresponsible [verantwortlich]\u201d, Heidegger says (1962\n[1927]: 334, translation modified). Authenticity, defined as standing\nup for and standing behind what one does\u2014as owning and\nowning up to one\u2019s deeds as an agent in the\nworld\u2014becomes possible in this sort of resolute commitment to\nthe \u201cfor the sake of which\u201d of one\u2019s existence.\n\nIt should be obvious that this conception of authenticity has very\nlittle to do with the older idea of being true to one\u2019s own\npregiven feelings and desires. But there is still a clear respect in\nwhich the idea of \u201cbeing true to oneself\u201d has a role to\nplay here. What distinguishes this conception from the conceptions of\npop psychology and romantic views of authenticity is the fact that the\n\u201ctrue self\u201d to which we are to be true is not some\npre-given set of substantive feelings, opinions and desires to be\nconsulted through inward-turning or introspection. On the contrary,\nthe \u201ctrue self\u201d alluded to here is an on-going narrative\nconstruction: the composition of one\u2019s own autobiography through\none\u2019s concrete ways of acting over the course of a life as a\nwhole. Feelings and desires are, of course, profoundly important, as\nare the features of one\u2019s situation and one\u2019s concrete\nconnections to others. Heidegger wants to recover a firm sense of the\nwholeness of the existing individual. But this wholeness is found in\nthe connectedness of what Heidegger calls the \u201chappening\u201d\nor \u201cmovement\u201d of a life\u2014that is, in the unfolding\nand constantly \u201cin-progress\u201d storyizing that continues\nuntil death. What is at stake in the ideal of authenticity is not\nbeing true to some antecedently given nature, then, but being\na person of a particular sort. Heidegger emphasizes that being\nauthentic presupposes that one instantiate such virtues as\nperseverance, integrity, clear-sightedness, flexibility, openness, and\nso forth. It should be obvious that such a life is not necessarily\nopposed to an ethical and socially engaged existence. On the contrary,\nauthenticity seems to be regarded as a \u201cexecutive virtue\u201d\nthat provides the condition for the possibility of being a moral agent\nin any meaningful sense whatsoever.\n\nOthers argue that Heidegger uses authenticity in both\nevaluative-normative and purely descriptive senses. In the descriptive\nuse of the term, inauthenticity is simply the default condition of\neveryday life, in which our self-relations are mediated by others. In\nthis sense, authenticity involves no judgment about which mode of\nbeing is superior for Dasein. But sometimes Heidegger\u2019s language\nturns normative (Carman 2003), and the seemingly neutral inauthentic\nform of relating transforms into something negative. Inauthentic\nDasein is now \u201cnot itself\u201d, loses itself\n(Selbstverlorenheit), and becomes self-alienated. At this point, it is\nargued that when introducing the normative-evaluative sense, Heidegger\npresents three modes of life:\nauthentic\u2014average(ness)\u2014inauthentic, where the authentic\nand inauthentic modes are existential modifications of average\neverydayness (Blattner 2006: 130; Dreyfus 1991). In this picture, an\nauthentic way of life is owned, an inauthentic disowned, and the\nmiddle one\u2014which is how we live much of the time\u2014is simply\none that is unowned. Dasein and authenticity emerge in contrast to\nthis background and out of this background, so that the primordially\nindifferent mode is the condition of possibility for authenticity or\ninauthenticity. In addition, Carman (2003: 295) argues that\nHeidegger\u2019s notion of conscience can help us further illustrate\nhis account of authenticity and shows how the \u201ccall of\nconscience\u201d may be interpreted as expressive responsiveness to\none\u2019s own particularity.\n",
