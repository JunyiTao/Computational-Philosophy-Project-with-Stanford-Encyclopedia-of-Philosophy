    "main_text": "The unity of theoretical and practical reason\n3. The unity of theoretical and practical reason\n\nWe have seen one link between theoretical and practical reason. In\nanswer to the question, \u201cWhat may I hope?\u201d Kant claims\nthat practical reason has \u201cprimacy.\u201d Theoretical reason\nmay accept the postulates of God, freedom and immortality \u201cas a\nforeign possession handed over to it\u201d (5:120). Theoretical\nreason can only show that these things are not impossible. Our\npractical interests\u2014at root, our moral obligations\u2014demand\nthat we believe in them. To cite Kant\u2019s famous words again:\n\u201cI had to deny knowledge in order to make room for\nfaith\u201d (Bxxx).\n\nKant\u2019s arguments for freedom are more extensive and compelling.\nHis arguments for God and immortality find little favor among\ncontemporary authors. Perhaps the strongest support comes from Jens\nTimmermann, who claims: \u201cthe principle that unifies the spheres\nof theoretical and practical reason\u2026 is the assumption of a\nwise and benevolent God who has created a teleological world that\ncoheres with morality\u201d (2009: 197). (On teleology in the\nCritique of the Power of Judgment, see Guyer 1989, Freudiger\n1996;\n Kant\u2019s aesthetics and teleology,\n \u00a73. Outside that work, see also Wood 1970, Kleingeld 1998b.)\n\nEven if Kant did believe this\u2014in his weaker moments,\n perhaps[26]\u2014such\n a position lacks wider philosophical resonance. Most contemporary\nphilosophers assume that the world does not \u201charmonize\nwith\u201d morality in this way\u2014or at any rate, that it is a\nhuman task to foster such harmony, for example, by building decent\nsocieties and just institutions. Reath 1988 argues that Kant sometimes\ndeploys a more defensible, \u201csecular\u201d or this-worldly,\nnotion of the highest good. Kleingeld 1995 and Guyer 2000a & 2000b\nalso offer interesting discussions.\n\nOnora O\u2019Neill has made the leading attempt to uncover the unity\nof Kantian reason and to relate it to contemporary philosophical\nconcerns (1989 and subsequent essays). This section will focus on her\ncentral claim concerning the unifying role of the Categorical\nImperative, and the main bases for this claim in Kant\u2019s texts.\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s interpretation of Kantian reason enjoys\nconsiderable respect among Kant scholars, although there are\nrelatively few critical responses to her work. Engstrom 1992 and Wood\n1992 offer early reviews; Westphal 2011 and Cohen 2014, 2018 take up\nher account, as does Bagnoli 2022: Ch. 4; see further\n constructivism in metaethics,\n \u00a72 (especially\n \u00a72.3).[27]\n",
