    "main_text": "What is an Abstract Object? || Eliminativism\n3.8 Eliminativism\n\nWe come finally to proposals that reject the abstract/concrete\ndistinction. We can consider three cases. First, there are the\nnominalists who both reject abstract entities and reject the\ndistinction as illegitimate. They focus on arguing against the\nformulations of the distinction proposed in the literature. A second\ngroup of eliminativists reject real objects of any kind, thereby\ndismissing the distinction as irrelevant; these are the ontological\nnihilists. A final group of eliminativists agree that there are\nprototypical cases of concrete objects and abstract objects, but\nconclude that a rigorous philosophical distinction can\u2019t be made\nclearly enough to have any explanatory power (see Sider 2013, 287).\nThis recalls Lewis\u2019 pessimism (1986a, 81\u201386) about the\npossibility of establishing a distinction that is sufficiently clear\nto be theoretically interesting.\n",
