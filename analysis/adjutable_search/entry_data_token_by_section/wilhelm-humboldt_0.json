    "main_text": "Humboldt\u2019s Life || Education and Early Writings\n1.1 Education and Early Writings\n\nHumboldt\u2019s father was of German middle class background whose family\nhad been granted the status of nobility with the title of\n\u201cFreiherr\u201d (Baron) in 1738 whereas his mother (maiden name\nde Colomb) was of middle class, mainly French Huguenot and\nGerman-Scottish extraction. Neither Wilhelm nor his younger brother\nAlexander (1769\u20131859) ever attended a public primary or\nsecondary school. Instead their father, and after his untimely death\nin 1779, their mother employed private tutors at the family estate in\nTegel who were recruited from among the leading figures of the Berlin\nEnlightenment scene. Among them were Joachim Heinrich Campe,\nwell-known educational writer, Ernst Ferdinand Klein and Christian von\nDohm, two leading political thinkers who brought enlightenment\norientation and ideas to the areas of constitutional law and public\npolicy. Johann Jakob Engel, the renowned philosopher and writer,\nintroduced the young Humboldt to modern and contemporary European\nphilosophy in the areas of logic, aesthetics, metaphysics and\nlanguage.\n\nWith Engel, Humboldt read and discussed works by Leibniz, Hume, Locke,\nHarris, Herder, Condillac and Rousseau. Yet at the same time both\nHumboldt brothers were deeply immersed in the study of the Greeks.\nWilhelm\u2019s first publication (at the age of 19) dealt with Socrates and\nPlato\u2019s idea of divinity (\u201cSocrates und Plato \u00fcber die\nGottheit\u201d) in which he defended the enlightenment ideal of\nnatural religion. As adolescents the two brothers began frequenting\nthe literary salon of Markus and Henriette Herz in Berlin where they\ncame into contact with intellectual luminaries of the city. It was\nhere that Wilhelm first met Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s eldest daughter\nBrendel Veit, the subsequent Dorothea Schlegel, Schiller\u2019s future\nspouse Charlotte von Lengefeld and his own bride-to-be, Karoline von\nDacher\u00f6den. After only one disappointing semester at the narrow\nand provincial Prussian University at Frankurt-on-Oder, the Humboldt\nbrothers transferred to the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1788,\narguably the most distinguished University in all the German-speaking\nterritories at the time. Besides jurisprudence, Wilhelm studied\nclassical philology with Christian Gottlieb Heyne, natural science\nwith Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (who counted him \u201camong the\nbrightest intellects\u201d he had ever met), and immersed himself\ndeeply in the study of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. In\nG\u00f6ttingen he met and became friends with August Wilhelm Schlegel,\nGeorge Forster and the philosopher Friedrich Jacobi. In August 1789\nshortly after the outbreak of the French Revolution and accompanied by\nhis former teacher Campe, Wilhelm visited Paris, the Rhineland and\nSwitzerland and captured his observations in a travel journal that he\nkept (GS Vol 14: 76\u2013236). In response to the challenge of the\nencounters with Forster and Jakobi, Humboldt was lead to articulating\nhis own philosophical position in \u201cOn Religion\u201d\n(\u201c\u00dcber Religion\u201d, GS Vol 1: 45\u201376), his first\nimportant writing.\n\nAfter having successfully passed his examinations in jurisprudence, he\nentered the Prussian civil service in Berlin in January of 1790 and\nwas appointed councillor (Legationsrat) soon afterwards. But\nhe found the position and the prospects it entailed uninspiring and\nboring and already in May 1791 decided to take leave from the service.\nIn June he married Karoline von Dacher\u00f6den and spent the\nfollowing years on his wife\u2019s family estates in Thuringia in the\nvicinity of Jena devoting his entire time and energy to his scholarly\nand philosophical pursuits while at the same time establishing\nlife-long personal and intellectual ties with the poets Johann\nWolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. He also befriended the\nfamed Homeric scholar Friedrich August Wolf, author of the\nProlegomena ad Homerum, and debated politics and political\nphilosophy with the statesman and Archbishop-Elector of Mainz, Karl\nTheodor von Dalberg. In 1792 he spelled out his views on key issues of\nthe social and political philosophy of the period in a series of\narticles for the Berlinische Monatsschrift and for Schiller\u2019s\njournal Neue Thalia. Among these were the \u201cIdeas\nconcerning constitutions occasioned by the new French\nConstitution\u201d and the programmatic \u201cWhat should be the\nLimits of the Government\u2019s Concern for the Well Being of its\nCitizens?\u201d\n\nThese writings formed part of a book-length manuscript that, because\nof the fear of censorship for its radical liberal position, was\npublished only posthumously in 1851 under the title Versuch die\nGrenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staates zu bestimmen (Engl. transl.,\n1854: The Spheres and Duties of Government). It represents\nthe classical statement of the liberal humanist tradition in German\npolitical thought which, however, seems to have found a more\nappreciative readership in nineteenth century England (Matthew Arnold,\nJohn Stuart Mill), than in Humboldt\u2019s native Germany. The Marxists\n(Lasalle) and conservative nationalists (Treitschke) alike rejected\nhis ideas and his staunch defense of the rights of the individual.\nJohn Stuart Mill, on the other hand, used a quote from Humboldt\u2019s text\nas motto for his own treatise On Liberty.\n",
