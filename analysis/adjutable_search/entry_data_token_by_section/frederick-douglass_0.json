    "main_text": "Slavery\n1. Slavery\n\nIn his narratives, speeches, and articles leading up to the U.S. Civil\nWar, Douglass vigorously argued against slavery. He sought to\ndemonstrate that it was cruel, unnatural, ungodly, immoral, and\nunjust. Douglass laid out his arguments, first in his speeches while\nallied with William Lloyd Garrison\u2019s American Anti-Slavery\nSociety, and then in his first autobiography, the Narrative.\nAs the U.S. Civil War drew closer, he expanded his arguments in many\nspeeches, editorials, and his second autobiography, My Bondage and\nMy\n Freedom.[7]\n\nHis definition of slavery identified its immorality and injustice by\npinpointing its core wrong in the brutalization and the literal\ncommodification of another human being and the stripping of them of\ntheir natural rights:\n\n\nSlavery in the United States is the granting of that power by which on\nman exercises and enforces a right of property in the body and soul of\nanother. The condition of a slave is simply that of the brute\nbeast. He is a piece of property\u2014a marketable\ncommodity in the language of the law, to be bought and sold at\nthe will and caprice of the master who claims him to be his property;\nhe is spoken of, thought of, and treated as property. His own good,\nhis conscience, his intellect, his affections are all set aside by the\nmaster. The will and the wishes of the master are the law of the\nslave. He is as much a piece of property as a horse. (1846 [SFD: 23];\nmy\n emphasis)[8]\n\n\nIn his own words, he worked to pour out \u201cscorching irony\u201d\nto expose the evil of slavery (1852 [SFD: 71]). His rebellion against\nslavery began, as he recounted, while he was enslaved. In his\nnarratives, the depiction of his early recognition and general\nrecognition among blacks and some whites of the injustice,\nunnaturalness, and cruelty of slavery was a significant element of his\nargument. It marks his first argument against slavery. Some of the\napologists for slavery claimed that blacks were beasts, subhuman, or\nat least a degenerated form of the human species, drawing on a racial\nideology that went back to at least the fifteenth century and that was\ncommon in the British American Colonies and then the United\n States.[9]\n Thomas Jefferson, for example, infamously intimates this racist view\nin his Notes on the State of Virginia (1785: Query 14).\nAgainst such racist ideology, Douglass argued that blacks were human,\nrational, and capable of the full range of human emotions and\nsensitivity. He mocked slavery\u2019s apologists for their\nhypocrisies and contradictions when they claimed otherwise. In\n\u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d, he is derisive\nof the idea that he would even need to argue this point (1852 [SFD:\n 55\u201392]).[10]\n\nAgainst the claim that blacks were beasts, he argued that instead,\nslavery had brutalized them. He pointed to the obviousness of\nblacks\u2019 humanity and mocked the hypocrisy of slavery\u2019s\napologists. He rhetorically asked: Why should there be special laws\nprohibiting the free actions of blacks, such as rebelling against\nslave masters, or any other white person, if slaves were merely\nbestial and incapable of independent, responsible behavior? Indeed,\nwhy had slave masters encouraged their slaves\u2019 Christianization\nand then forbade their religious gatherings? Along with this\nhypocrisy, American slaveholders feared and banned the education of\nblacks while demanding and profiting from their learning and\ndevelopment in the skilled trades. Thus, Douglass argued the\naccusation that blacks were beasts was predicated on the guilty\nknowledge that they were humans. Additionally, it subverted not only\nthe natural goodness of blacks by brutalizing them, but it also did so\nto white slaveholders and those otherwise innocent whites affected by\nthis wicked institution. Slavery, Douglass pointed out, consistent\nwith Jefferson\u2019s anxieties in Query 18 of the Notes on the\nState of Virginia (1785), was a poison in the body of the\nrepublic.\n\nSecond, since blacks were humans, Douglass argued they were entitled\nto the natural rights that natural law mandated\n (\u00a72\n and\n \u00a73)\n and that the United States recognized in the Declaration of\nIndependence and Constitution\n (\u00a74).\n Slavery subverted the natural rights of blacks by subjugating and\nbrutalizing them: taking men and turning them, against God\u2019s\nwill and nature, into beasts. Third, as an affront to natural law,\nslavery contradicted God\u2019s laws and corresponding moral duties\nto others. As a witness and participant of the second Great Awakening,\nhe took the politicized rhetoric of Christian\nredemption\u2014personal and social liberation from\nsin\u2014seriously. Douglass viewed redemption as intrinsically\nwrapped up with freedom from slavery and national liberation like\nother abolitionists. Fourth, he argued that slavery was inconsistent\nwith the idea of America, with its national narrative and highest\nideals, and not just with its founding documents. Fifth, drawing on\ntheories of providential historical development (echoing common\nAmerican views of manifest destiny), he argued that slavery was\ninconsistent with moral, political, economic, and social progress.\nInsofar as it propagated and protected slave power, America was on the\nwrong side of history on the question of slavery.\n\nThe apologists of slavery drew on the same ideological vein of\nhistorical progress to offer the defense that slavery was a benevolent\nand paternal system for the mutual benefit of whites and blacks.\nDouglass countered that calumny by drawing on his experiences, and the\nexperiences of other enslaved black Americans, that American slavery\nwas in no way benevolent. It brutalized black people. Slavery\nsubjected them to debilitating, murderous violence, sexual violence\nand exploitation, split up families, denied them education, exploited\ntheir labor, and denied their natural property rights. Slavery, as\nDouglass\u2019s relentlessly argued, was a deep and enduring\ninjustice and evil. Enslaved black people were not happy slaves\nbenefiting from the largess of kind, gentile white masters. Neither\nwere they lacking in agency, self-esteem, self-respect, or a sense of\ndignity. They were moral beings, fully aware of the rights and\ncapabilities they were unjustly deprived of. As Douglass proclaimed to\nthe nation and world, black Americans wanted freedom, independence,\nthe recognition of their full personhood, moral equality, and their\nrights as U.S. citizens (McGary and Lawson,\n 1992).[11]\n",
