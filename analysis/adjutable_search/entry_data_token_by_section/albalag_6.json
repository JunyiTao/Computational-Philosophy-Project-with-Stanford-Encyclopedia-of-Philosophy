    "main_text": "God-world Relationship || The Origin of the World\n5.1 The Origin of the World\n\nOn scientific grounds, Albalag dismisses the doctrine of temporal\norigination as \u201cdefective\u201d and accepts the eternal\nexistence of the universe as an indisputable truth (we will see below\nthat he accepts the former on the authority of Scripture). Albalag,\nhowever, attempts to present the Aristotelian theory of eternity and\nits fundamental premises in a theologically appealing fashion. Thus,\nhe introduces the theory of \u201ceternal origination\u201d\n(\u1e25id\u016bsh ne\u1e63a\u1e25i) which maintains that\n\u201cthere was no moment at which the universe was not\noriginated\u201d (Tiqqun n.30: 30; cf. Tah\u0101fut\nal-Tah\u0101fut, Third Discussion). That the universe has no\ntemporal beginning is a premise that Albalag accepts based on\nAristotle\u2019s demonstration of the eternal existence of spheres\nand celestial motion (see for instance Tiqqun, n.30: 30,\n60:84\u201397; cf. De Caelo I: 2\u20133). What remains is\nto show that the universe is not self-sufficient. This procedure is\nnecessary in order to avoid confusing the philosophical doctrine of\neternity with that of Epicurus which maintains that \u201cthe\nuniverse has no cause\u201d (Tiqqun n.30: 45).  More\nspecifically, it shows that the philosophical conception of eternal\ncausation is not heretical and does by no means eliminate the idea of\norigination.\n\nFor this purpose, Albalag engages in a philosophical discussion in\nwhich he sets out to demonstrate the consistency of the theory of\neternal origination\u2014in addition, he offers interpretive notes to\nshow that the doctrine of eternal origination is not offensive to\nScripture (for the interpretive notes see Feldman 2000: 19\u201330).\nHis discussion indirectly links to some elements of al-Ghazali\u2019s\nrefutation of philosophers in Tah\u0101fut al-Fal\u0101sifah\nconcerning their conceptions of God and the universe.\nAl-Ghazali\u2019s central point of contention is that the\nphilosophers\u2019 exposition of the relation of God to the universe\ndwells on two premises that form an oxymoron, namely that the universe\nis eternal and that it has an Agent and Maker (see Tah\u0101fut\nal-Fal\u0101sifah third and tenth discussions). Contrary to\nal-Ghazali, Albalag holds these premises to be absolutely consistent.\nWhat is more, he introduces the theory of eternal origination as a\nmore adequate way for articulating the universe and divine causation\nthan the doctrine of temporal origination, the \u201cdefective\u201d\ndoctrine of the multitude which confines divine causation to\ntemporality. If perfection indicates absoluteness, then the term\n\u201cperfect\u201d (shalem) applies to both \u201cthe\nabsolute\u201d (mu\u1e25la\u1e6d) universe, which\neternally and immutably exists, and \u201cthe absolute\u201d Creator\nwhose act of creation is free from temporal or circumstantial\nlimitations.\n\nThe doctrine of eternal origination rests on a conception of the\nuniverse as a moving entity in which the cause-effect relationship is\na relation between a mover and a moved object (see Tiqqun\nn.30: 29; cf. Tah\u0101fut al-Tah\u0101fut:  third discussion,\n101). In the natural realm, all processes of generation and corruption\nconsist in motion\u2014for instance the movement from potential to\nactual existence\u2014and occurs through motion. All natural changes\ndepend on the movements of the celestial spheres, which in turn depend\non the Mover of the outermost sphere, the Prime Mover (Tiqqun\nn.30: 29,  n.39: 62).\n\nBeyond this well-known Aristotelian conception of the Prime Mover as\nthe ultimate cause of motion in the universe, Albalag seeks to prove\nthat the very act of producing motion is sufficient to make the Prime\nMover a cause/creator of the universe. To this end, he differentiates\nbetween two classes of existents in terms of their dependence on\nmotion: \n\nexistents whose subsistence requires motion, and \n existents whose subsistence do not require motion; only\ntheir coming-to-be requires motion. \n\n\nThings belonging to the latter class continue to exist after their\ncauses perish\u2014for instance, a house continues to exist after the\ndeath of its builder. By contrast, things belonging to the former\nclass perish as soon as motion ceases\u2014for instance wind does not\ncontinue to exist as soon as the motion of air ceases (Tiqqun\n30: 30; cf. Averroes Tah\u0101fut al-Tah\u0101fut, fourth\ndiscussion: 156\u20138). These things are said to be more in need of\na cause than things belonging to the former class are, for should the\ncause disappear from existence \u201cfor a twinkling of an\neye\u201d, they would necessarily perish (Tiqqun n.30: 30).\nThe universe as a whole belongs to this class. Both the natural and\ncelestial realms subsist because their constituent \u201cparts are\neternally originated\u201d through the motion produced by the Prime\nMover; the parts of the natural and celestial realms referring to\nsublunary existents and the \u201csuccessive\u201d stages of\ncelestial motion respectively (Tiqqun, n.30: 30). \n",
