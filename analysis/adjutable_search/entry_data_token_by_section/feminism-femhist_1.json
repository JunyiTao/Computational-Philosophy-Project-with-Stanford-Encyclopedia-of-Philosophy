For example,\nto cite Cynthia Freeland's catalogue: \u201cAristotle says that the courage\nof a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter\nyearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the\nbeautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an\nincomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity': which contributes only\nmatter and not form to the generation of offspring; that in general 'a\nwoman is perhaps an inferior being'; that female characters in a\ntragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or too\nclever\u201d(Freeland 1994: 145\u201346). However dispiriting or annoying this\nlitany is, and whatever problems it presents to a woman studying or\nteaching Aristotle, it can be argued that Aristotle simply held a\nmistaken view about women and their capacities (as did most Athenians\nof his time). But, if this is so, then Aristotle's theories, or most of\nthem, are not tarnished by his statements about women, and we can\nignore them, since they are false. \n\n\nHere Aristotle is the chosen example, but similar feminist\ncritiques are available chronicling the explicit misogyny of other\ncanonical figures like Plato and Kant. Feminist criticisms of Plato's\ntheories stress dialogues (like the Timaeus and Laws)\nthat characterize women as inferior to men rather than the egalitarian\nRepublic. Kant's writings, like Aristotle's, provide the ideal\ntarget for feminist criticism because they contain both overt\nstatements of sexism and racism, and a theoretical framework that can\nbe interpreted along gender lines.[2]\n",
