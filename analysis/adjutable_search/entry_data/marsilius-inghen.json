    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nMarsilius of Inghen was born around 1340 in Nijmegen, a city in the\neastern part of the Low Countries\n (Netherlands).[1]\n In the older literature it is often said that he came from one of the\nvillages in the vicinity of Nijmegen (Inghen), but this view is\nmistaken. It was based on a confused reading of the Oratio\nFunebris held in 1396 by Nicholas Prowin at the funeral of\nMarsilius and published in 1499 at\n Mainz.[2]\n From 1362 on, Marsilius was master at the Faculty of Arts at the\nUniversity of Paris, where he was also rector (1367 and 1371), and a\nstudent of theology. As a teacher at Paris, Marsilius was much\nesteemed and his lectures drew large audiences. Among his students\nwere many compatriots, some of whom came from Nijmegen and surrounding\nvillages. In 1378, Marsilius found himself the University\u2019s\ndelegate at the court of Pope Urban VI in Tivoli. In 1379, he\ninstructed one of his colleagues, Hugh of Hervort, to look after his\ninterests in Paris. After 1379, Marsilius\u2019s name is no longer\nmentioned in the acts of the University of Paris. He probably turned\naway from Paris because of the imbroglio surrounding the Great Schism\nof 1378. Meanwhile, he kept in touch with his native city. In 1382 the\ntown council of Nijmegen treated him to a banquet. From 1386 on,\nMarsilius was master at the University of Heidelberg. There, as in\nParis, he held a number of administrative offices. He was one of the\nfounders of the University of Heidelberg, of which he was rector no\nfewer than nine times, from 1386\u20131392 and also in 1396. In\n1389\u20131390, as the University\u2019s nuncio together\nwith Conrad of Soltau, he was responsible for transferring the\nUniversity register to Rome (Boniface IX). At the beginning of the\n1390s, Marsilius again took up the study of theology. The masters who\ntaught theology were by then Conrad of Soltau (since 1387) and Matthew\nof Krakow (since 1394), both from the University of Prague. In\n1395/1396 Marsilius finished his lectures on the Sentences\nand so became the first theologian to obtain the doctorate at\nHeidelberg. He died a short time later, on August 20, 1396.\n\nMarsilius was a prolific writer. His work was the fruit of his\nteachings in Paris and Heidelberg. Many of his writings have been\npreserved in manuscripts or early printed editions, although recently\nsome have appeared in modern critical editions. His most important\nwritings\n include:[3]\n\nWorks on Logic and Epistemology\n\nExposition of the Old Logic\nVarious Questions on the Old and New Logic\nSummary [Abbreviationes] of the Old and New\nLogic\nTreatises on the Properties of Terms: On Supposition,\nAmpliation, Appellation, Restriction, Obligation, Insolubles, and\nConsequences.\n Works on Natural Philosophy and Metaphysics\n\nSummary [Abbreviationes] of Aristotle\u2019s\n\u2018Physics\u2019\nQuestions on Aristotle\u2019s \u2018On Generation and\nCorruption\u2019\nQuestions on Aristotle\u2019s \u2018De\nanima\u2019\nQuestions on Aristotle\u2019s\n\u2018Metaphysics\u2019\n Works on Ethics\n\nQuestions on Aristotle\u2019s \u2018Nicomachean\nEthics\u2019\n Works on Theology\n\nQuestions on the \u2018Sentences\u2019 of Peter\nLombard\n\n\n2. Teachings\n2.1 Logic and Epistemology\n\nIn his logic and epistemology, Marsilius followed the nominalist\ntradition of the fourteenth century as exemplified by William of\nOckham and John Buridan. Yet Marsilius never qualified himself as a\nnominalist or follower of Ockham. He was an independent thinker who\nsometimes went back to the older tradition of the thirteenth century\n(e.g., in Peter of Spain), or advocated theories which were more in\nline with ordinary speech, as against the highly specialized views of\nhis contemporaries. Marsilius employed logical methods and discussed\nlogical and epistemological issues in almost all of his writings,\nincluding his commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard,\nwhich, in addition to his works specifically dedicated to logic, were\nalso used as a source for late medieval and early modern treatises on\nlogic.\n\nMarsilius\u2019s nominalism comes to the fore in his views on the\nobject of scientific knowledge, the nature of universals, and the\nlogical doctrine of supposition. His basic assumption is that there\nare only individuals and no universals outside the human mind.\n2.1.1 The Object of Scientific Knowledge\n\nAccording to the Aristotelian standard accepted by Marsilius, the\nobject of scientific knowledge must be universal and necessarily true.\nThis is not the case with individual things in the external world,\nsince they are subject to change. Only the conclusion of a true and\nnecessary syllogism can meet the standard. Hence, for Marsilius, the\nobject of scientific knowledge is not anything outside the mind, but\nthe mental proposition which refers to individual things and their\nqualities. More specifically, the proper object of scientific\nknowledge is a proposition in the form of a conclusion that has been\ndeduced from necessary\n premises.[4]\n2.1.2 Universals\n\nMarsilius argued that universal concepts such as\n\u2018humanity\u2019 do not refer to real universals outside the\nhuman mind. Accordingly, there is no universal essence in singular\nindividuals. Individuals of one genus or species do resemble each\nother, however, and this resemblance is the foundation of universal\nconcepts in the human mind. The generation of universal concepts is a\nnatural process, which Marsilius described as follows: suppose\nindividual A of species S evokes concept X\nin the human mind. This concept is similar to concept Y which\nhas been evoked by B of the same species S. By\nabstracting from all the differences between X and\nY, the human mind is able to produce another concept,\nZ, which stands for both A and B.\nUniversality is then taken to be a quality of concept Z, the\nproduct of the epistemological operation of abstraction on concepts\nX and Y by the human\n mind.[5]\n2.1.3 Supposition\n\nIn line with his account of the nature of universals, Marsilius\nrejected simple supposition. Logicians such as Peter of Spain had used\nthe notion to indicate that a term stood not for an individual but for\na universal or common nature in the external world, like the term\n\u2018man\u2019 in the proposition, \u2018Man is a species\u2019.\nSince Marsilius rejected the idea of universals existing outside the\nmind, he eliminated simple supposition from the list of different\ntypes of supposition. He was critical of some of his contemporaries\n(e.g., Albert of Saxony) who likewise dismissed the concept of real\nuniversals, yet kept on using the notion of simple supposition. They\nhad changed the meaning of the term, he said, by claiming that a\nwritten or spoken term had simple supposition if it was used to refer\nto a concept in the human mind. Marsilius wondered whether young\nstudents would be able to understand this new meaning of simple\nsupposition, since they would hardly know what concepts are. To avoid\nconfusion, Marsilius decided not to deal with simple supposition at\nall in his\n logic.[6]\n2.1.4 Categories\n\nIn his commentary on the Categories, Marsilius\nadheres to William of Ockham\u2019s and John Buridan\u2019s view\nthat the ten Aristotelian categories are distinguished by the way they\nrefer to things in extra-mental reality. The emphasis here is on the\n\u2018way they refer to\u2019 things, i.e., their modus\nsignificandi, and not on the things themselves, he argues, since\ndistinct categories like \u2018quantity\u2019 and\n\u2018quality\u2019, while doing so in different manners, may still\nrefer to one and the same individual thing in the outside world, e.g.,\nSocrates. Different categories, therefore, do not represent different\nthings but stand for distinct and unique ways of signifying\n things.[7]\n Together, the ten categories cover all possible ways of speaking\nabout things. Like Buridan, however, Marsilius emphasizes that it is\nimpossible to prove that their precise number is and must be ten, as\nsome philosophers like Albert the Great had claimed. It is only\nlengthy experience that has led philosophers to acknowledge their\nnumber to be\n ten.[8]\n If an additional mode of signifying things was discovered in the\nfuture, Marsilius states, he would readily accept there to be more\nthan ten Aristotelian categories, even though he does not consider\nsuch a discovery to be very\n likely.[9]\n\n\nAccording to Marsilius, the ten Aristotelian categories refer to\nthings in reality which themselves are not signs of other things.\nThese categories are names or concepts of primary intention, as he\ncalls them. However, since there are also names which are used to\nrefer to signs or to names of things and not to things themselves\n\u2014 such as the terms \u2018genus\u2019 and\n\u2018species\u2019, which are called names of secondary intention\n\u2014 there needs to be an additional category of secondary\nintention, beside the ten Aristotelian categories of primary\nintention. This category may be called the \u2018category of\nsigns\u2019 (praedicamentum signi) or the \u2018category of\nterms\u2019 (praedicamentum termini), Marsilius\n says.[10]\n The existence of such a category does not refute the traditional\nnumber of ten categories, since the traditional categories, even\nthough they are names or concepts themselves, do not refer to names or\nconcepts, but to things in reality. In claiming such a category,\nMarsilius goes beyond John Buridan, who does not recognize it, and\nfurther elaborates a position already mentioned by Duns Scotus.\nAccordingly, for the metaphysician who considers \u2018being as\nbeing\u2019 (ens inquantum ens) there are only ten\ncategories, whereas for the logician who deals with \u2018concepts as\nconcepts\u2019 (intentiones per se ) there are more than\nten. In the late Middle Ages, philosophers like John Eck attributed\nthe view that there is an additional category called\npraedicamentum signi to Marsilius of Inghen and his\nfollowers, among whom was the Nominalist John\n Parreut.[11]\n2.1.5 Some Specific Views\n\nMarsilius was his own person when it came to assessing the views of\nothers. In his analysis of the proposition \u2018Socrates is not a\nchimera\u2019 he followed what he called \u2018the Parisian\nmethod\u2019, according to which the proposition is false because the\nterm \u2018chimera\u2019 supposits for nothing, there being no real\nchimeras to which it can refer. Others, however, considered the\nproposition to be\n true.[12]\n\nElsewhere, he departed from the opinions of the Parisian School\n(scola Parisiensis) and opted for the perspective of ordinary\nlanguage or common way of speaking (communis modus loquendi).\nThis was the case with his analysis of the proposition \u2018The\nAntichrist is not, but he will be\u2019. According to the Parisian\nSchool, the term \u2018he\u2019 refers to the thing referred to by\nthe term \u2018Antichrist\u2019. Since there is no Antichrist,\nneither term has reference. But in ordinary language it is different,\nfor there the term \u2018he\u2019 is meant to refer to the future\nAntichrist. Marsilius accepted the latter analysis as sound, despite\nthe authority of the\n former.[13]\n\nIn the definition of ampliation, Marsilius went back to logicians of\nthe thirteenth century such as Peter of Spain, who had defined\nampliation as an extension of supposition, whereas fourteenth-century\nlogicians such as Albert of Saxony did not consider ampliation to be a\nkind of supposition. Marsilius reinterpreted their definition so that\nit fit better with the older tradition. Such efforts to harmonize\nolder and newer positions were typical of the late fourteenth\n century.[14]\n\nRegarding the theory of consequences, Marsilius was in line with John\nBuridan and Albert of Saxony. However, unlike them, he considers the\nconsequence as an oratio, not as a hypothetical proposition,\nproperly speaking. As such, consequences also include statements that\nhave no truth value. Crucial for a consequence is the so-called\nnota illationis, which signifies the necessary connection\nbetween the antecedent and the consequent. This connection is\nunderstood as a relationship of semantic entailment. Similar to Albert\nof Saxony but unlike Buridan, for Marsilius there are no invalid\nconsequences. A consequence is either valid or it is no\n consequence.[15]\n\nIn the context is his theory of consequence, Marsilius treats the\nwell-known issue of coming to be (incipit) and passing away\n(desinit). Here he likewise follows John Buridan, although once\nagain in an independent way. His logical point of view, intentionally\nignoring specific features of physical reality, is striking. For\nexample, he considers the physical distinction between permanent and\nsuccessive things irrelevant to the validity of consequences that\nimply notions of coming to be and passing away. Also, in dealing with\nsuch consequences, he accepts indivisible instances of time for\nmethodological reasons, though physically speaking time is infinitely\ndivisible for him. Here, he joins Albert of\n Saxony.[16]\n\nFinally, Marsilius\u2019s understanding of per se predication\nprovides a similar picture. His point of departure again is Buridan.\nYet, he includes some remarkable new elements. For example, he defines\nper se predication not as a necessary predication, as Buridan\nand most contemporary authors do, but as a predication which excludes\nany contingency. Thus per se predication covers both necessary\npropositions like \u2018Man is a living being\u2019 and impossible\nones such as \u2018Man is a donkey\u2019. Also, he widens the realm\nof per se predications by allowing not only the traditional\ncategorical affirmative per se predication, but also\nhypothetical and negative ones, like \u2018If there are humans, all\nhumans are living beings, and \u2018Man is not a donkey\u2019. Here,\nhis probable sources of inspiration were William of Ockham and Albert\nof\n Saxony.[17]\n2.2 Natural Philosophy and Metaphysics\n\nIn natural philosophy and metaphysics Marsilius was an empiricist,\nmeaning that he thought all scientific knowledge must be based on\neither sense data or self-evident propositions, i.e., propositions in\nwhich the meaning of the predicate is included in the subject.\nEveryone who knows the meaning of the terms of such propositions\njudges them to be evidently\n true.[18]\n This has far-reaching consequences for the relationship between\nphilosophy and theology. Since the philosopher uses only sense data\nand self-evident propositions, his inquiry may come to different\nconclusion than that of the theologian, who has additional knowledge\nfrom Scripture. The philosopher makes judgments about the world from a\nlimited human perspective, whereas the theologian is helped by divine\n revelation.[19]\n Yet Marsilius took the task of the philosopher seriously because he\nthought the human mind has a natural tendency to search for truth,\nwhich is satisfied (although not ultimately satisfied) in natural\nphilosophy and\n metaphysics.[20]\n2.2.1 Creation\n\nAccording to the principles of natural philosophy, creation from\nnothing is impossible. The senses show that things always come from\nother things. Because there is no serious reason to doubt the\ninformation given by the senses, the human mind legitimately jumps to\nthe universal principle that nothing can come from nothing, driven by\nthe natural tendency to search for truth. Consequently, for the human\nmind creation from nothing is impossible. It contradicts the universal\nprinciple that nothing comes from nothing. That God has created the\nworld from nothing is therefore only a matter of faith (sola fide\nest creditum). Revelation shows that human knowledge of creation\nis limited, but it cannot be aided by natural philosophy at this\n point.[21]\n2.2.2 Theory of the Human Soul\n\nIn the later Middle Ages the study of the soul was part of natural\nphilosophy. Marsilius treated the human soul in his commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s De anima, in which he followed the Parisian\ntradition of Buridan and Oresme concerning the particular questions\naddressed. Following Buridan, he argued that there is no natural proof\nof the immortality of the human soul. For the human natural mind,\nunaided by revelation, the theory of Alexander of Aphrodisias that the\nhuman soul is corruptible is the most probable. That Alexander of\nAphrodisias is mistaken and that the soul continues to exist after the\ndeath of the body is known through revelation alone. Faith has more\nauthority than human reason and must be accepted in all cases where\nthe two conflict since the things we believe on faith come from God,\nwho cannot\n err.[22]\n2.3 Metaphysics\n\nAlthough metaphysics cannot surpass the limits of human knowledge,\nMarsilius considered it to be the entry point to theology. Natural\nreason is capable of forming some adequate and true concepts of God,\nand also of forming true propositions about God. It is able to prove\nthat God exists and possesses knowledge and will. But it cannot\ndemonstrate that God has free will or infinite power. This, Marsilius\nclaimed, was also true for philosophers such as Aristotle, whose\nteachings equal those of natural reason\n itself.[23]\n\nFrom Buridan, Marsilius took the idea that God according to Aristotle\nand Averroes is not only the final cause of the heavens and separate\nsubstances, but also their efficient cause. On this point Buridan and\nMarsilius were following the view of Scotus and Ockham against that of\nJohn of Jandun, Johannes Baconis, and Gregory of Rimini. It is worth\nnoting in this connection that in the Puncta super libros\nMetaphysicae (i.e., brief abstracts of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics for teaching purposes) attributed to Johannes de\nSlupcza and written in Krakow in 1433, some of the views that\nMarsilius adopted from Buridan, including the one just mentioned, are\nattributed to Marsilius instead of Buridan \u2014 notwithstanding the\nfact that the author was familiar with both Marsilius\u2019s and\nBuridan\u2019s commentaries. This illustrates the strong influence\nMarsilius\u2019s work exerted on fifteenth-century students and\n commentators.[24]\n\nOn other points, however, Marsilius was critical of Buridan. For\nexample, Marsilius considered Buridan\u2019s solution to the problem\nof the possible separation of accidents from their substance as not in\naccordance with the teachings of Aristotle, and therefore not truly\nmetaphysical (metaphysicaliter), but rather in line with\ntheological concerns. Only miraculously could God take over the\nsupporting power of the substance, thus separating the accident from\nits natural bearer. According to Marsilius, however, such possible\ndivine intervention should not be taken into account in metaphysics,\nwhere the philosopher must use natural reason\n alone.[25]\n\nMarsilius was the first rector of the University of Heidelberg.\nAccording to the oldest Statutes of the Arts Faculty of this\nuniversity, every master must inform the students that whenever\nAristotle contradicts faith, e.g. in his claim that the world is\neternal, he is following natural reason and although his arguments in\nthese cases are wrong and faith must be accepted, natural reason\ncannot help but follow Aristotle and therefore cannot prove the\nconclusions of\n faith.[26]\n This paragraph clearly echos Marsilius\u2019s view on the issue.\nOther contemporary universities, like that of Vienna, were less\nrigorous and prescribed a more harmonious procedure, stipulating that\nwhenever there was a conflict with faith, the masters had to argue in\nfavor of faith against Aristotle to the best of their\n possibilities.[27]\n2.4 Theology\n\nMarsilius expressed his theological views in a voluminous commentary\non the Sentences. He quoted and often adopted views that were\nput forward by fourteenth-century theologians such as Adam Wodeham and\nGregory of Rimini, but was also influenced by earlier thinkers such as\nThomas Aquinas and Bonaventure. He has serious reservations about the\nuse of logic in theology.\n2.4.1 Attributes and Ideas\n\nIn his discussion of the divine attributes he followed mainly the\nteachings of Adam Wodeham. God is perfectly one. Divine wisdom and all\nother perfections attributed to God are in reality as identical to the\ndivine essence as the divine essence is identical to itself. In the\ndivine essence itself there is no distinction or non-identity\nwhatsoever between the attributes of God. Any distinctions between\ndivine attributes are necessarily of a rational (rather than real)\nnature and are made by\n us.[28]\n\nA similarly radical stance on the unity of God was assumed in his\ntreatment of divine ideas. Ideas are not formally distinct in God, as\nsome Scotists would argue, but only extrinsically and objectively\ndistinct. Their distinction is a consequence of the differences\nbetween the creatures produced by God (which is why Marsilius spoke of\nextrinsic distinction), and of the fact that they are known by God as\ndifferent (which accounts for their objective distinction). God knows\nthat he is the cause of infinitely many differences between creatures.\nThat is why his mind contains infinitely many different\n ideas.[29]\n\nMarsilius criticized Ockham\u2019s view that God\u2019s idea\ncoincides with creation. If this were true, Marsilius argued, the idea\nof producing a stone must be identical with either the stone itself,\nor the stone insofar as it is known by God. If the former, then God\nmust look outside of himself in his idea, which contradicts the\nposition of Augustine, who is quoted by Ockham. If the latter, then\nthe idea of its production is not the stone itself, but rather\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge of the\n stone.[30]\n2.4.2 Theology and Logic\n\nMarsilius advanced his criticism of the use of logic in theology in\nhis discussion of the position of Robert Holcot. Holcot had argued\nthat logically, God can be called the cause of evil. If God is the\ncause of every thing (entitas) and moral evil (malum\nculpae) is a thing, then God is the cause of evil. Marsilius\nacknowledged that the argument is based on true premises, yet the\nconclusion should not be defended as true because it contradicts faith\nand therefore might cause confusion among believers. Theologians\nshould not flaunt their personal skills in logic, but always write out\nof reverence for the divine. Their writings should not erode the\nbeliefs of ordinary people, who are not skilled in logic, but rather\naim to strengthen them\n spiritually.[31]\n\nMarsilius was anxious, however, to avoid the implication that\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge is somehow dependent upon human beings. In\nhis discussion of Adam Wodeham on the causality of the human will, he\ncomplained that Adam had not been emphatic enough on this point, since\nhe allowed the following argument: if an event E will happen\nin the future, then God knows E from eternity; but if\nnot-E will happen, then God knows not-E form\neternity; since man is free, he can choose between E and\nnot-E; therefore, he can change God\u2019s foreknowledge.\nThis argument is logically sound, Marsilius argued, but it easily\nleads to the false conclusion that God\u2019s knowledge depends on\nthe free will of man, which is absurd. The eternal cannot fall under\nthe power of that which is created by it. Therefore, this argument\nshould not be used. It is better to remain on the safe side by\nmaintaining what has always been maintained, namely that God through\nhis absolute omniscience knows the future activities of human beings,\nbut without being dependent on\n them.[32]\n\nAlso in his discussion of trinitarian and Christological issues he\nwarns theologians not to naively follow the rules of logic without\nbearing possible misunderstandings in mind. Although the sentence\n\u2018Christ is only God\u2019 is logically true because Christ is\nGod and no other person born on earth but Christ is God, it is\ndangerous to accept this sentence without further qualifications,\nMarsilius argues, because it seems to confirm the view of those\nheretics who claim that Christ was without a human nature, as the word\n\u2018only\u2019 can be understood to exclude humanity when added to\nthe word\n \u2018God\u2019.[33]\n2.4.3 The Sacraments\n\nIn his treatment of the sacraments at the end of his commentary on the\nSentences, Marsilius drew heavily on the writings of Thomas\nAquinas and Bonaventure. He defended Thomas\u2019s view that the word\n\u2018this\u2019 pronounced by Christ at the Last Supper in uttering\n\u2018This is my body\u2019 (Mk. 14:22) refers to what the bread and\nbody have in common. Thomas of Strasbourg had attacked this view, but\nMarsilius showed that the earlier Thomas was right and the later\n wrong.[34]\n\nIn his discussion of the causality of the sacraments, Marsilius\nfollowed the exposition of Bonaventure, according to whom the\nsacraments have no causality of their own. It is God who acts whenever\nthe sacraments are administered correctly. Only in a broad sense is it\ntrue to say that the sacraments have the power to\n act.[35]\n3. Influence\n\nThe influence of Marsilius has been considerable, particularly through\nhis logical works and commentaries on Aristotle. This may be gathered\nnot only from the large number of manuscripts that have been\npreserved, but also from several other\n considerations.[36]\n Marsilius\u2019s commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Prior\nanalytics was used in Prague in the 1380s. His logical works,\nincluding the Obligationes and the Consequentiae,\nwere used as textbooks in Vienna in the 1390s. His commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics and Physics were read\nin Krakow during the first sixty years of the fifteenth century. At\nthe universities of Heidelberg, Erfurt, Basle, and Freiburg, his works\nwere studied throughout the fifteenth century, in particular as part\nof the university curriculum. In 1499, the doctors and masters of the\nVia Moderna at the University of Heidelberg published a\nvolume that included epigrams on Marsilius by well-known humanists\nsuch as Jacob Wimpfeling, as well as a defense of Nominalism in the\nstyle of Marsilius (Via Marsiliana). Praise in the form of\nepigrams can also be found in the 1501 Strasbourg edition of\nMarsilius\u2019s commentary on the Sentences. The\nObligationes, printed in 1489 under the name of Peter of\nAilly, were used by Thomas Bricot, John Major, and Domingo de Soto.\nThe commentary on the Prior Analytics was quoted by Agostino\nNifo. Jodocus Trutvetter and Bartholomew of Usingen, who consolidated\nnominalism in Erfurt, repeatedly mentioned Marsilius in their works.\nBoth Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei referred to\nMarsilius\u2019s commentary on De Generatione et\nCorruptione.\n\nThe theological views of Marsilius appear to have had some circulation\nas well. His commentary on the Sentences was known in Krakow\nin the first half of the fifteenth century, and was used by Thomas de\nStrampino in his Principia (1441\u20131442). The University\nof Salamanca had a theological chair (C\u00e1tedra de Nominales) for\ncommentary on the works of Marsilius of Inghen and Gabriel Biel. His\ncommentary on the Sentences was quoted by Spanish theologians\nsuch as Francisco de Vitoria, Domingo de Soto, Luis de Molina, and\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez, usually in connection with questions about\ndivine foreknowledge and grace.\n\nThere are nine extant manuscripts of Marsilius\u2019s commentary on\nthe Sentences. Among the former owners of these manuscripts\nwere two libraries for preachers (Ansbach and Isny), and two libraries\nof faculties of arts (Erfurt and Leipzig). The education in Erfurt and\nLeipzig included the reading of nominalist authors. In all\nprobability, the artists became interested in Marsilius\u2019s\ntheological work after studying his writings on logic and physics. The\npresence of Marsilius\u2019s commentary on the Sentences in\npreachers\u2019 libraries bears witness to the fact that the impact\nof his work was felt beyond university\n circles.[37]\n",
