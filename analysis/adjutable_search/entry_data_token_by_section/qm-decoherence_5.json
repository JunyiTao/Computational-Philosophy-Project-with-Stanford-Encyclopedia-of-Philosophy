    "main_text": "Decoherence and the Measurement Problem || Solving the measurement problem?\n2.1 Solving the measurement problem?\n\nThe fact that interference is typically very well suppressed between\nlocalised states of macroscopic objects suggests that it is at least\nrelevant to why macroscopic objects in fact appear to us to be in\nlocalised states. In the special case of measuring apparatuses, it\nwould then be relevant to why we never observe an apparatus pointing,\nsay, to two different results. Does modelling measurements\nincluding the decoherence interactions with the environment\nallow one to derive that measurements always have results? This is\nsomewhat part of the \u2018folklore\u2019 of decoherence, but as\npointed out by many physicists and philosophers alike (e.g. Pearle\n1997; Bub 1997, Chapter 8; Adler 2003; Zeh 2003a, pp. 14\u201315), it\nis not the case: while decoherence does explain why we do\nnot observe superpositions of measurement results, it does\nnot explain why we do observe measurement results in the\nfirst place.\n\nIndeed, what happens if we include decoherence in the description?\nDecoherence tells us, among other things, that plenty of interactions\nare taking place all the time in which differently localised states of\nthe apparatus registering, say, different \\(x\\)-spin values of an\nelectron couple to different states of the environment. But now, by\nthe same arguments as above, the composite of electron,\napparatus and environment will be a superposition of (i) a state\ncorresponding to the environment coupling to the apparatus coupling in\nturn to the value \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\) for the spin, and of (ii) a state corresponding\nto the environment coupling to the apparatus coupling in turn to the\nvalue \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) for the spin. We are thus left with the following choice,\nwhether or not we include decoherence: either the composite\nsystem is not described by such a superposition, because the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation actually breaks down and needs to be\nmodified, or it is described by such a superposition, but then we need\nto either to supplement quantum mechanics with appropriate hidden\nvariables, or to give an appropriate interpretation of the\nsuperposition.\n\nTherefore, decoherence as such does not provide a solution to the\nmeasurement problem, at least not unless it is combined with an\nappropriate foundational approach to the theory \u2013 whether this\nbe one that attempts to solve the measurement problem, such as\nBohm, Everett or GRW; or one that attempts to dissolve it, such\nas various versions of the Copenhagen interpretation.
