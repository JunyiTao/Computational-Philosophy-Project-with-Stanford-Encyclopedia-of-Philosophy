    "main_text": "Classification Schemes in the Epistemology of Modality || Necessity-First vs. Possibility-First\n2.2 Necessity-First vs. Possibility-First\n\nHale (2002) draws an important distinction between two different\narchitectures one can use in building an epistemology of modality.\nNecessity-first accounts hold that we first acquire knowledge\nof necessity and then arrive at knowledge of possibility by inferring\nwhat is consistent with what we know to be necessary.\nPossibility-first accounts, by contrast, hold that we first\nacquire knowledge of possibility from which we then generalize to\nknowledge of necessity. Most conceivability-based accounts\n (\u00a74.1)\n implement a possibility-first approach. So do dispositionalist\napproaches as well as Roca-Royes\u2019 similarity-based account, as\nthey all prioritize possibilities\n (\u00a77).\n Counterfactual-based accounts such as Williamson\u2019s\n (\u00a74.2)\n seem instead more neutral concerning the distinction. Finally,\nessence-based accounts\n (\u00a75)\n are usually necessity-first. (For discussion see: Hale (2013),\nRoca-Royes (2017), and Fischer (2017)).\n",
