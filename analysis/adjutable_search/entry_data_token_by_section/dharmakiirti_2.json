    "main_text": "Metaphysics || A causal theory of properties\n1.4 A causal theory of properties\n\nWe seem to have in Dharmak\u012brti what would nowadays be termed a\ntype of \u201ccausal theory of\n properties.\u201d[18]\n Particulars have causal properties, that is, powers\n(\u015bakti) or \u201cfitness\u201d (yogyat\u0101)\nto produce such and such results, in that they will produce those\nresults when the right \u201ccomplete collections\u201d\n(s\u0101magr\u012b) of circumstances and other properties are\nunited. And what makes any property what it is consists in the\ncontribution it makes to the potential causal behaviour of what has\nit.\n\nThe question then arises in what way particulars have properties or\npowers. It is important to emphasize that for Dharmak\u012brti and\nmany other Buddhists particulars are not separate entities that\nown or have separately existing properties/powers.\nMuch of the argument here in Buddhist Epistemology (and in other\nschools of Buddhism) is essentially an appeal to perceptual evidence\nand common sense: particulars are real and must be objects of\nperception; nobody perceives a particular without its properties, and\nindeed nobody can see a difference between the bearer of the\nproperties and the properties themselves; hence any such distinction\nis unreal. These reasons are also fleshed out into a fundamental\nposition, initially strongly advocated by Dign\u0101ga, that\nsubject-predicate differences in language do not mirror a\ncorresponding difference between substances and properties in reality\n(see\n section 2.2).\n Bare particulars that somehow have properties, or in which properties\nare instantiated, would thus be ruled\n out.[19]\n\nAre the powers themselves particulars or universals? It can be argued\nthat Dharmak\u012brti and his fellow Buddhists are best understood as\ntrope theorists: the powers/properties that make up\nparticulars are themselves particular entities, differing according to\neach location in space and time (see\n section 2.2.2).\n Charles Goodman and others have made a persuasive case that\nproperties (dharma) for \u0100bhidharmika Buddhists are\nindeed tropes, i.e., properties that are particular\u2014a blueness,\na heat, or a hardness specific to one place-time and not common to\nseveral. The Epistemologists\u2019 version of dharmas would be no\nexception in that respect of being particulars rather than\n universals.[20]\n The causal theory, however, does make for some significant\ndifferences from \u0100bhidharmikas. Many important\n\u0100bhidharmikas, i.e., those of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school,\nregarded dharmas from a complex double perspective: a) their\nintrinsic natures (svabh\u0101va), i.e., what they\nare, and b) their present causal activity\n(k\u0101ritra) along with their capabilities\n(s\u0101marthya) to lead to effects when the appropriate\ncircumstances obtain. The intrinsic natures of dharmas are\ngiven in terms of categorical properties\u2014being blue, being\nsquare, being hard, etc\u2014and are treated like quiddities, what\ndharmas simply are in themselves. The activities and\ncapabilities, on the other hand, are presented in causal terms, e.g.,\ngiving rise to perceptions of blue and square, producing subsequent\nsimilar things, etc. Not surprisingly, there are involved Abhidharma\ndebates on the relationship between the intrinsic natures and causal\nactivities/capabilities, a rather typically evasive\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101din response (i.e., that of Sa\u1e45ghabhadra)\nbeing that they are neither the same nor\n different.[21]\n The most radical way out of this problem of the relationship between\nthe intrinsic and the causal is to say, as do N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and\nhis M\u0101dhyamika followers, that there cannot really be any\nintrinsic natures at all: if anything had a quiddity intrinsically, as\n\u0100bhidharmikas and others hold, it would absurdly need to have it\ncompletely acausally\u2014nothing could ever cause a thing to be what\nit is intrinsically. A less radical strategy is a causal theory that\nmakes no separation at all between what something is and what\nit does. That is the strategy that Dharmak\u012brti ably\n pursued.[22]\n\nLet us grant that for Dharmak\u012brti particulars are somehow\nidentified with appropriate causal powers. Is it then an essential or\nan accidental feature of a thing x that it will produce\ny under the appropriate conditions, and is it essential or\naccidental to y that it is caused by x? In a causal\ntheory of properties these features are generally taken to be\nessential. To what degree does Dharmak\u012brti subscribe to that? The\npoint needs analysis. On the one hand, Dharmak\u012brti does very\nstrongly advocate a type of connection that seems to be more than an\naccidental feature of things. This is the so-called \u201cconnection\nby essential natures\u201d (svabh\u0101va\u00adpratibandha)\n [23]\n between cause and effect, and this connection will guarantee that\nthere is a \u201cnexus where [the effect] will not be without [the\ncause]\u201d (avin\u0101bh\u0101vaniyama). Arguments\ninvoking this nexus can, for example, be seen in the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikasvav\u1e5btti\u2019s discussion of\nI.34\u201347. He begins by introducing verse 34 as follows:\n\n\nWell, if observation and non-observation were no basis for knowing the\nco-presence and co-absence [of smoke and fire], how then does one know\nthat smoke does not deviate (na vyabhicarati) from\n fire?[24]\n\n\nDharmak\u012brti then argues that whatever is smoke must have\noriginated from fire in order for it to be smoke\u2014otherwise it\u2019s\njust a smoke-like thing, a pseudo-smoke. And he also says that if\nsomething like a \u201ctermite tower\u201d\n(\u015bakram\u016brdhan) did actually have the causal\nproperties of fire\u2014i.e., the fitness (yogyat\u0101) to\nproduce real smoke\u2014then it indeed would be on fire (see\nDunne 2004, 335\u2013338).\n\nThat said, on the other hand, there certainly is no development of a\nmodal logic of necessity and possibility and talk of possible worlds\nin Dharmak\u012brti, nor in Indian philosophy generally for that\n matter.[25]\n Although Buddhist Epistemologists do often talk of non-existent\nthings, like rabbit\u2019s horns\n(\u015ba\u015bavi\u1e63\u0101\u1e47a), it is far from clear\nthat they would predicate positive properties (say, sharpness) of them\nin such and such possible situations or \u201cworlds.\u201d What\nthen is the force of the \u201cmust\u201d in the smoke-fire cases,\nand more generally when terms have a \u201cnexus\u201d so that one\nwill not be without the other? Words that are typically used in these\nkind of Dharmak\u012brtian discussions are ni\u015bcaya\n(certainty) and avyabhic\u0101ra (not-deviating). Many modern\ninterpreters have used the term \u201cnecessity\u201d in\ninterpreting these and related terms (See e.g., Dunne 2004, ch. 3;\nIwata 2004); this might lead one to think that when F and\nG have a nexus, it is a necessary truth (i.e., true in all\npossible worlds) that for all x, if x is F\nthen x is G. A more likely interpretation, however,\nis that Dharmak\u012brti is dealing with the actual world and that\nthese key terms are to be interpreted epistemically in terms of\njustification: given such and such natural connections between\nF and G, we can be sure that for all\nx, if x is F then x is G.\nTaking ni\u015bcaya in this way, his point would not be about\nmetaphysical necessity throughout worlds but more about justified very\nstrong confidence that a universally quantified material implication\nholds without exception in the actual world because of natures in this\n world.[26]\n",
