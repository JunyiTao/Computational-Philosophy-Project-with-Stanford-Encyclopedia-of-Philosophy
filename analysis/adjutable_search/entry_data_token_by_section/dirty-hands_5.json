    "main_text": "The Dirty Hands of Citizens\n6. The Dirty Hands of Citizens\n\nMost of the discussion of dirty hands concentrates upon the situation\nof the individual political leader who must dirty his or her hands,\nbut another interesting question concerns the dirt on the hands of\ncitizens themselves when their leaders act thus on their behalf. This\nis particularly acute for democratic citizens to whom representative\ntheory applies more plausibly than to citizens of an autocracy. In\nWalzer\u2019s original discussion, he insists that part of the\ntension, even agony, of the dirty hands problem arises from the fact\nthat we, the governed, want our leaders to be virtuous, but also want\nthem to have the sort of character that can act against deep moral\nprinciple when the supreme emergency arises. Of the politician who\ndirties his hands in a good cause but realises he is acting immorally,\nWalzer writes: \u201cBecause he has scruples of this sort we know him\nto be a good man. But we\u2026hope that he will overcome his\nscruples\u2026We know he is doing right when he makes the deal\nbecause he knows he is doing wrong\u201d (Walzer 1973, 166; 1974,\n68). But if so, our endorsement would seem to have some implication\nfor our own hands. This is not an implication that Walzer fully\nexplores, though he does say in the last sentence of his original\narticle when discussing the need to penalise dirty hands that we\ncan\u2019t punish the dirty hands of the principal agents\n\u201cwithout getting our own hands dirty, and then we must find some\nway of paying the price ourselves\u201d (Walzer 1973, 180; 1974,\n82).\n\nVarious other writers have however explored the implication, either\ndirectly or as part of the discussion of the supposed need to\n\u201cpunish\u201d dirty hands (for this topic see below). Most\nrecently David Archard complains that \u201c\u2026there has been\nlittle discussion of the putative complicity, and thus also dirtying\nof hands, of a democratic public that authorizes politicians to act in\nits name\u201d (Archard 2013, 777). Here he echoes an earlier\nposition taken by Martin Hollis and also similar claims made by Dennis\nThompson. As Hollis puts it: \u201cPolitical actors, duly appointed\nwithin a legitimate state, have an authority deriving finally from the\nPeople. Currently that means from you and me.\u2026 When their hands\nget dirty, so do ours\u201d (Hollis 1996, 146\u20137). Like Walzer\nthey assume that somehow the ruled require the rulers to dirty their\nhands, and this opens the way to distribute some degree of\nresponsibility or \u201cdirt\u201d to them.\n\nTaking Walzer\u2019s claim first, it is not at all obvious that\n\u201cwe\u201d want or hope that our leaders will violate deep moral\nprohibitions where they judge it necessary to achieve important\npolitical ends or avoid very bad outcomes, even if they remain\nconscious of their wrongdoing. No doubt some of us do and some of us\ndon\u2019t, but the issue is not really one of counting the\npreponderance of desire in the community; it is rather whether there\nis something inherent in the relation of the democratic citizenry to\nits leadership that authorizes the leaders to dirty their hands in the\nrelevant way. Archard explicitly argues for such an authorization,\nclaiming that it is this authorization that gives the citizens a share\nin the taint of dirty hands. Hollis, Dennis Thompson, Neil Levy and\nJanna Thompson rely upon some similar link.\n\nBut what exactly is this the nature of this authorization? It must be\nmore than simply giving certain people the authority to govern on our\nbehalf since that seems compatible with implicit or explicit\nrestrictions upon what they can or cannot do. Clearly, Archard needs\nsome strengthening of what the authorization allows; he tries to\nachieve this by using the idea of a division of labor. Specifically,\nhe argues that there is a both a political and a moral division of\nlabor (Archard 2013, 782). The political is relatively\nuncontroversial: it is the thesis that efficiency is best served by\nthe legitimate, multiple tasks required in a community being divided\nand the task of governing is one of them. This makes no further\nnormative claims about restrictions or entitlements related to the\nexercise of those tasks, and is compatible with most forms of\ngovernment. The moral division asserts that the different roles in\nsociety carry with them different moral prerogatives and duties\nappropriate to the different roles. But whatever the merits of such\nrole morality, it is not clear that it permits rulers to do anything\nat all that they believe will fulfill the purposes of their role.\nCombining the idea of role with that of authorization cannot show that\nthe authorized role player is entitled to use whatever means he or she\njudges the only effective way of achieving the role\u2019s purposes.\nIf it did, then authorizing a debt collector would seem to imply that\nthe agent may torture the debtor if that is the only way to collect a\nsignificant debt.\n\nIt might be conceded that this is ludicrous in the debt-collecting\nexample, but that the political role is different because of the very\nhigh stakes, not only for the politicians, but for the democratic\ncitizens. Yet we have already seen that it is hard to contain the\ndirty hands story within the realm of the political, and very few\npolitical decisions are momentous enough to give politics a status\nsufficiently privileged to exempt its practitioners, through that\nrole, from those deep moral constraints that restrict the\ndebt-collector or other agents in non-political life. Indeed,\nconsciousness of these facts helps explain why Walzer has\nprogressively tightened the conditions in which dirty hands apply. So\nthe question about authorization must focus on whether\n\u201cwe\u201d can plausibly be said to have authorized violations\nof deep moral principle in supreme emergency situations. Dennis\nThompson insists we do when he says that the dirty hands politician\nacts \u201cnot only for us, but with our consent\u2014not only in\nour name but on our principles\u201d (Thompson 1987, 18).\n\nThis confident answer to the question is not however supported by\nargument or even survey, and seems to assume unanimity amongst the\n\u201cwe\u201d of a pluralistic, democratic community that is\nunlikely to obtain. Dennis Thompson relies upon the legitimacy of the\ndemocratic process and citizens\u2019 assent to its outcomes, but,\naside from any general problems with consent theory, the ruler\u2019s\ndirty hands acts are often enough illegal or unconstitutional, as in\nthe case of torture, or in violation of declared policies that got the\nruler elected. Moreover, what we want of our political leaders will\npresumably depend upon who \u201cwe\u201d are and what moral and\npolitical principles \u201cwe\u201d hold. Suppose a dirty hands\ndecision has been made by the leaders to torture an innocent child in\norder to extract information from the child\u2019s radical parent\nabout a \u201cticking bomb\u201d (and suppose that this is a genuine\ndirty hands decision and not one flawed by lack of knowledge or\nignoring of preferable alternatives) then it is plausible to hold that\nthose citizens who think that the moral politician should violate his\n(and their) deep moral objections to torture in such circumstances\nmust share in the guilt or shame that should attach to the politician.\nBut there will surely be many citizens who either think that the moral\nviolation should not have occurred, even in these circumstances, or\nwho think that the prohibition is not as deep as commonly supposed and\nhence that the politician\u2019s decision is right but not immoral.\nIt is implausible to hold that both these groups are implicated in\ndirty hands in the way Archard and others suggest that all democratic\ncitizens, merely by being citizens, are.\n\nMoreover there is a further question underlying the question of\nconsent or authorization or expectation, namely that concerning what\nwe ought to want, expect or authorize and what principles we ought to\nhave. This is the question whether politicians ought to get their\nhands dirty, in any sense of \u201cought\u201d that carries ultimate\nweight. If the politicians are right (in certain, presumably extreme,\ncircumstances) to dirty their hands and they are right to do it on our\nbehalf, then at least those of us who agree that it is right are\ninvolved in what they do and have some responsibility for it. Indeed,\nwe are more than tainted, we are complicit.\n\nEmphasizing the shared guilt of citizens has implications for a\nfurther issue, concerned with how the dirty hands perpetrator should\nbe treated after the event. Walzer argues that the politician\u2019s\ngenuine guilt means that she should suffer a penalty or a shaming for\nhaving done what \u201cwe\u201d want her to do (Walzer 1973,\n177\u20138; 1974 79\u201380). Others have taken a similar line\nthough the position has been criticized by, for example, Tamar Meisels\nand Neil Levy (Meisels 2008a, 227 and Levy 2007 throughout). There are\nserious problems about moral responsibility in claiming that a dirty\nhands agent who does what is morally wrong because he must should be\npunished or publicly disgraced. After all, if the freedom to act is a\nprecondition of moral responsibility and therefore blame, then the\ndirty hand agent who does what is (all-things-considered) necessary\nand somehow right seems immune to the criticism involved in blame.\n(For further elaboration of this and related objections see Levy 2007;\nalso Meisels 2008a, 226\u201327.) The point here, however, is that,\neven if it is proper to blame and shame for dirty hands, then, on the\nsupposition that all citizens share in the taint, selecting only one\nto shame seems distinctly unjust, indeed massively hypocritical. While\nthe rest of us rejoice and celebrate the happy consequences of our\nagent\u2019s necessary misdeed, she is shunned or worse. As already\nnoticed, Walzer does think that punishing the dirty hands conduct of\nthe principal agents makes our own hands dirty (though he\ndoesn\u2019t seem to think that our original authorization of the\nconduct does this). He doesn\u2019t elaborate the point, but it opens\nup intriguing prospects since presumably we dirty \u201cour\u201d\nhands in punishing these agents precisely because, in some sense, they\nare \u201cinnocent\u201d or at least do not deserve punishment\nbecause they have acted \u201crightly\u201d. This opens up bizarre\npossibilities of regress since \u201cwe\u201d now should have to pay\na further price for inflicting a price on ourselves when we have done\nthe right (but immoral) thing in punishing ourselves, and so on and\non. It seems the spreading of responsibility for dirty hands to the\ngoverned community merely adds to worries about the coherence of the\nconcept.\n\nClaims of shared guilt or taint raise further questions about the\nresponsibility that democratic citizens as well as their leadership\nhave for remedying the evil done to the victims of the dirty hands\ndecision. Stephen de Wijze (de Wijze, 2018) argues that not only must\nthe leadership try to justify their decision to their constituents,\nbut they and all their democratic citizens are liable to make\nrestitution to victims for the \u201cnecessary\u201d harm done by\nthe dirty hands decision. Admittedly, he thinks that that although the\ncitizens are complicit their \u201cmoral pollution\u201d is\ngenerally less than the leadership. Even so, they are obliged to make\namends to the victims of the decision. All citizens, he argues, even\nthose dissenting from the decision, must \u201cshare in the moral\nburden, and contribute to the appropriate restitution\u201d (de\nWijze, 2018, 144). So they must pay \u201csome penalty\u201d perhaps\nin the form to increased taxation to effect reparations.\n\nThe claim that all democratic citizens are so obliged needs some\nunpacking since there is clearly a difference in liability for those\nwho enthusiastically supported or were indifferent to the dirty hands\ntactic and those who opposed it. There is some plausibility in the\nclaim that even strongly dissenting democratic citizens incur some\nrestorative and other moral obligations as a result of their\nleaders\u2019 dirty hands behaviour, but support for this claim need\nnot resort to dubious extensions of the idea of collective guilt or\nmoral taint. Membership in a democratic political community (or even\nin some non-democratic ones) creates a set of relationships that\ninvolve forms of identification such that a degree of pride can be\ntaken in good decisions by the leadership and by fellow citizens and a\ndegree of shame or alienation at bad ones. None of this means that the\ndissenting citizen is in any way morally responsible for those\ndecisions, but what it may mean is that the dissenting citizen has\nsome special moral responsibility to criticise those decisions,\nincluding the dirty hands ones that she rejects, and to do what is\npossible, in spite of her lack of pollution or guilt, to repair the\nbad effects. Responsibility for bad acts should be distinguished from\nresponsibility to remedy or compensate for them, though it is a\ncomplex matter how to sketch the lineaments of this distinction.\n",
