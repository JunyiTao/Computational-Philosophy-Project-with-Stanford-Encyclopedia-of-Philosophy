    "main_text": "Analyzing Play || Further Directions\n4.4 Further Directions\n\nBelief revision and learning theory Belief revision\nin repeated games bears natural resemblance to limit learning of\n formal learning theory\n (Kelly 1996). Baltag,\nGierasimczuk, and Smets (2011) analyze\nlearning in terms of initial epistemic-doxastic models over which\nfinite histories of signals trigger the learner to revise beliefs,\nrepresented as changes in epistemic accessibility or plausibility\norder. It turns out that both iterated public announcement and\niterated radical upgrade as discussed above are universal learning\nmethods, though only the latter maintains this property in the\npresence of (finitely many) errors in the input stream.\n\nGoal dynamics and intentions While preferences and\ngoals have so far been assumed fixed and universally known, this is by\nno means necessary. van Otterloo (2005)\npresents a dynamic logic of strategic powers, where information about\nplayers\u2019 intentions and preferences can be announced during\nplay. Roy (2008) uses announcements of\nintentions to obtain simplified solution procedures for strategic\ngames. More concrete scenarios of extraneous information flow are\nfound in Parikh, Ta\u015fdem\u0131\u0307r, and\nWitzel (2013), where agents manipulate the knowledge of others\nduring play.\n\nGame change In many real life scenarios, players do\nnot know the full game tree they are playing. Even if they did, it\nmight change during play. Or, at least, players may attempt to change\nthe game. A concrete example is provided by the game tree in\n Section 4.1.1.\n There, the inefficient Backward induction outcome \\((1, 0)\\) could be\navoided by E promising not to go left. When made binding (for\ninstance through imposing a fine) this announcement eliminates\nhistories and, consequentially, a new backward Induction outcome of\n\\((2,2)\\) results. Hence, both players can be made better off by\nrestricting the freedom of one. Game theory has sophisticated analyses\nof such scenarios, including an analysis of \u2018cheap talk\u2019\n(Osborne & Rubinstein 1994), asking\nwhen such announcements are credible. On the logical side, this\nsuggests an analysis of signaling games (van\nRooy 2004). We are not aware of any logical work done in this\ndirection.\n\nReal games The discrepancy between specification of a\ngame and the realities of play is especially striking in real game\nplay, either of the \u2018natural kind\u2019 in common parlor games\n(van Ditmarsch & Kooi 2015), or of\nthe artificial kind found in the laboratory experiments of\nexperimental game theory (Camerer 2003).\nLittle work has been done by logicians in this realm, though there is\na broad tradition of computational analysis of games (Schaeffer\n& van der Herik 2002; Kurzen\n2011). Any adequate logical analysis would clearly need to\nincorporate the considerations on bounded agency discussed in\n Section 3.\n\nMathematical foundations Logic of play as discussed\nhere raises issues of how to interfaces local with global dynamics.\nThis shows in particular with logical limit behavior, where\nobservations and assertions are made repeatedly. Limit models of\npublic announcement, as described earlier, can be\n\u2018self-fulfilling\u2019 or \u2019self-refuting\u2019. In the\nfirst case, the property asserted becomes common knowledge among all\nagents, whereas in the second it eventually becomes false at the\nactual world. With soft update on plausibility models, a third option\narises, namely, infinite oscillation, or even divergence (Baltag\n& Smets 2009). To date, there is\nno general logical theory of these phenomena, but see van\nBenthem (2011) on the use of fixed-point\nlogics for limit models, Miller and Moss\n(2005) on the high complexity of public announcement logic with\nfinitely iterated announcements, and Klein and\nRendsvig (2017) on limit behavior of product updates.\n\nThe topic of limit behavior also raises the issue of how local dynamic\nlogics of agency relate to the global temporal logics discussed in\n Section 4.2.4.\n Towards clarifying the connection, van\nBenthem, Gerbrandy, Hoshi, and Pacuit (2009), show how\ndynamic-epistemic logics can be seen as decidable fragments of more\nexpressive temporal logics. Baltag, Smets, and\nZvesper (2009) discuss the related theme of how dynamic\nrepresentations can decrease complexity by shifting information from\nthe temporal universe to dynamic events.\n\n\n\n",
