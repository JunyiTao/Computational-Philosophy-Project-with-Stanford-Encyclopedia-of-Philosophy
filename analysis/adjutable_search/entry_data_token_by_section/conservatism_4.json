    "main_text": "The Nature of Conservatism || Conservatism and liberalism: the standpoint of freedom vs. standpoint of paternalism\n1.5 Conservatism and liberalism: the standpoint of freedom vs. standpoint of paternalism\n\nConservatism can be further elucidated by contrasting it with\nliberalism. Both liberalism and socialism are more theoretically\ncomplex than conservatism, for two reasons: conservatism\nself-consciously rejects philosophical theorising; and, since\nacademics tend towards the left, conservatism as a political\nphilosophy continues to be neglected. (For instance, Scruton describes\nhis book The Meaning of Conservatism (1980) as\n\u201cdogmatics\u201d rather than philosophy.) There could be no\nconservative theory of distributive justice to rival Rawls\u2019,\nsince, for conservatives, the problems that Rawls addresses do not\nexist. For them, politics does not concern the theoretically complex\njustification of ends, but rather facilitates the enjoyment of\n\u201cnon-political\u201d ends such as \u201ccountry\u201d,\n\u201cfamily\u201d and \u201creligion\u201d (Ashford 1990:\n40\u20131).\n\nIt is often argued that modern political philosophy is animated by the\nidea of freedom, while ancient political philosophy rests on a natural\norder discernible by reason to which humans must conform (Franco 1999:\n2). But conservatism is a modern standpoint whose commitment to\nfreedom is contested; it can be argued that the liberal standpoint of\nfreedom is opposed by the conservative standpoint of paternalism or\nauthority. The dividing line between ancient and modern may be\nRousseau, for whom the purpose of the state is not merely security of\nlife and property, as Hobbes, Locke and conservatives maintain;\nrather, it is freedom itself (Franco 1999: 9). Rousseau\u2019s works\nwere held to influence the French revolutionaries, and late 18th and\nearly 19th century thinkers were convinced that the Revolution was\ncaused by philosophers\u2019 ideas of equality, democracy, freedom\n(Israel, 2002). (In fact, Rousseau regarded the revolutionary cure as\nworse than the disease, and was pessimistic about political progress.)\nIn expressing the standpoint of freedom, philosophical liberalism\nembraces ethical individualism\u2014that all value and right reduces\nto value of or for individuals, and the rights of\nindividuals\u2014respect for persons, and freedom of thought and\ndiscussion, based on individual autonomy (Skorupski 2015). For\nclassical liberals, liberty thrives only when traditional sources of\nauthority\u2014monarchical, aristocratic, religious\u2014are\nrejected. \n\nIt is often said that liberals prioritise rights over duties, while\nconservatives prioritise duties over rights. Conservative thinking\nexpresses the standpoint of paternalism:\n\n\n\u2026the value of individual liberty is not absolute, but stands\nsubject to\u2026the authority of established government\u2026the\nconservative will seek to uphold all those practices and institutions\nthrough which habits of allegiance are acquired. (Scruton 1980: 19,\n30)\n\n\nObedience, for Scruton, is the principal virtue of political subjects,\nwithout which societies atomise and crumble; real freedom is not in\nconflict with obedience, but is its other side (Scruton, 1980). For\nOakeshott, there is no freedom without authority. For Beiser,\npaternalism holds that\n\n\nthe purpose of the state is to promote the welfare, religion and\nmorality of its subjects, and not only to protect their rights.\n(Beiser 1992: 282)\n\n\nBurke was \u201cless concerned with protecting the individual from\nthe potential tyranny of the State, and more to protect the property\nof the few from the folly and rapacity of the many\u201d (Lock 2006:\n321\u20132). \n\nThe contrast with liberalism and its standpoint of freedom should be\nqualified, however \u2013 the contrast is not an absolute one, but a\nmatter of balance and tone. For instance, the visceral opposition of\nWestern conservatives to the Soviet Union was motivated by a\ncommitment to freedom. Burke himself wanted to enhance freedom, but\nheld that it is realised imperfectly in our institutions; pursuit of\nan abstract ideal may lose us what freedom we have. Both conservatives\nand classical liberals advocate limited government; it is\nparticularist scepticism and an associated pessimism that define\nconservatism. Liberals concurred with Burke\u2019s limits on\ngovernment, concern for private property, and judicious reform (Kirk\n1954: 162). However, although Burke agreed that government originates\nfrom the need to protect property, he disavowed many of Locke\u2019s\nprinciples (Kirk 1954: 14). \n\nConservatives reject the liberal\u2019s concept of abstract,\nahistorical and universal rights, derived from the nature of human\nagency and autonomy, and possessed even when unrecognised, for\ninstance by slaves in Ancient Greece (on abstract rights, see for\ninstance Gewirth 1983). For conservatives, a priori claims\nsuch as L.T. Hobhouse\u2019s \u201cThe proper end of government is\nthe uncovering of civil liberties\u201d, are doubly mistaken\n(Hobhouse 1964 [1911]: 19); government does not have such ends, and\n\u201cuncovering civil liberties\u201d is particularly disruptive.\nHowever, while Hobhouse, Rawls and Dworkin defend abstract and\nuniversal rights, liberals such as Mill are more\nhistorically-sensitive\u2014through the influence of Coleridge, he\ndrew on aspects of conservative thought. Mill\u2019s abstract utility\nprinciple becomes conservative in operation, through his emphasis on\nthe malleability and educability of character; our preferences,\ndesires, and tastes arise from existing institutions, and so any\nabstract institutional blueprint fails to maximise utility. For Mill,\na nation\u2019s history and society decide the best apparatus of\ngovernment, and he locates Coleridgean \u201cIdeas\u201d in\n\u201corganic\u201d historical institutions\u2014their original\npurpose and meaning. However, Mill\u2019s perfectionism contrasts\nwith conservative pessimism about human nature, and he rejected what\nhe called \u201cintuitionism\u201d, which fosters conservatism by\nassuring people that anything they believe deeply enough must be true;\nrather, he holds that inveterate beliefs must be justified by reason\n(Mill, Autobiography, CW, I: 233; Skorupski 2010: 24). Despite\nthe influence of Coleridge, therefore, Mill remained a liberal and not\na conservative, who valued reason above Burkean prejudice.\n\nConservatives are not legal positivists, and allow some idealisation\nof rights; indeed, even legal positivists Bentham, Austen and Hart, in\nconceding that there are moral constraints, allow that there are bad\nlaws. Burke held that the Stuart monarchs abrogated the rights of\nfree-born Englishmen; under the Stuarts, therefore, the latter had\nrights that were not simply those that prevailed. Indeed, Burke does\nnot entirely reject the concept of natural rights. Though sceptical of\nappealing to rights that are beyond positive law, in his writings on\nIndia, he acknowledged that when deprived of positive legal resources,\none can appeal to natural law though not natural right (Bourke 2014;\nthough see Stanlis 1953, and Canavan 1960). \n\nThis section has focused mainly on Burkean conservatism, treated as\nscepticism about the role of reason in politics. The next section\nanalyses the historical development of Burkean conservatism,\ncontrasting it with more rationalist traditions of conservatism, and\nalso looking at North American traditions, and modern conservatism.\n\n",
