    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy\n5. Evaluation\n\nValla\u2019s contributions to historical, classical, and biblical\nscholarship are beyond doubt, and helped to pave the way for the\ncritical textual philology of Poliziano, Erasmus, and later\ngenerations of humanists. Valla grasped the important\ninsight\u2014which was not unknown to medieval philosophers and\ntheologians\u2014that the meaning of a text can be understood only\nwhen it is seen as the product of its original historical and cultural\ncontext. Yet his attempt to reform or transform the scholastic study\nof language and argumentation\u2014and, indeed, their entire mode of\ndoing philosophy\u2014is likely to be met with skepticism or even\nhostility by the historian of medieval philosophy who is dedicated to\nthe argumentative rigor and conceptual analysis which are the\nhallmarks of scholastic thought. Nevertheless, while it may be true\nthat Valla\u2019s individual arguments are sometimes weak,\nsuperficial, and unfair, his critique as a whole does have an\nimportant philosophical and historical significance. The following two\npoints, in particular, should be mentioned.\n\nFirst, the humanist study of Stoicism, Epicureanism, skepticism, and\nNeoplatonism widened the philosophical horizon and eroded faith in the\nuniversal truth of Aristotelian philosophy\u2014an essential\npreparatory stage for the rise of early modern thought. In\nValla\u2019s day, Aristotle was still \u201cthe Philosopher,\u201d\nand scholastics put considerable effort into explaining his words.\nValla attacks what he sees as the ipse dixit attitude of the\nscholastics. For him, a true philosopher does not follow a single\nmaster but instead says whatever he thinks. Referring to\nPythagoras\u2019 modest claim that he was a not a wise man but a\nlover of wisdom (Repastinatio, 1:1; DD 1:2), Valla\nmaintains that he does not belong to any sect (including that of the\nskeptics) and wants to retain his independence as critical thinker.\nWhat the scholastics forget, he thinks, is that there were many\nalternatives in antiquity to the supposedly great master, many sects,\nand many other types of philosopher. In criticizing Aristotle\u2019s\nnatural philosophy, for instance, he gave vent to a sentiment which\nultimately eroded faith in the Aristotelian system. This does not,\nhowever, mean that he was developing a non-Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy; his rejection of Aristotle\u2019s account of nature was\nprimarily motivated by religious and linguistic considerations.\nIndeed, Valla\u2019s insistence on common linguistic usage, combined\nwith his appeal to common sense and his religious fervor, seems at\ntimes to foster a fideism that is at odds with an exploratory attitude\ntowards the natural world. But with hindsight we can say that\nany undermining of the faith in the exclusiveness of the\nscholastic-Aristotelian worldview contributed to its demise and,\nultimately, to its replacement by a different, mechanistic one. And\nalthough the humanist polemic was only one factor among many others,\nits role in this process was by no means negligible. Likewise, in\nattacking Peripatetic moral philosophy, Valla showed that there were\nalternatives to the Aristotelian paradigm, even though his use of\nEpicureanism and Stoicism was rhetorical rather than historical.\n\nThe second point relates to the previous one. In placing himself in\nopposition to what he regarded as the Aristotelian paradigm, Valla\noften interprets certain doctrines\u2014the syllogism, hypothetical\nsyllogism, modal propositions, and the square of contraries\u2014in\nways they were not designed for. In such cases, we can see Valla\nstarting, as it were, from the inside of the Aristotelian paradigm,\nfrom some basic assumptions and ideas of his opponents, in order to\nrefute them by using a kind of reductio ad absurdum or\nsubmitting them to his own criteria, which are external to the\nparadigm. This moving inside and outside of the Aristotelian paradigm\ncan explain (and perhaps excuse) Valla\u2019s inconsistency, for it\nis an inconsistency which is closely tied to his tactics and his\nagenda. He does not want to be consistent if this means merely obeying\nthe rules of the scholastics, which in his view amounted to rigorously\ndefining one\u2019s terms and pressing these into the straightjacket\nof a syllogistic argument, no matter what common sense and linguistic\ncustom teach us. Behind this inconsistency, therefore, lies a\nconsistent program of replacing philosophical speculation and\ntheorizing with an approach based on common linguistic practice and\ncommon sense. But arguably it has also philosophical relevance; for\nthroughout the history of philosophy a warning can be heard against\nabstraction, speculation, and formalization. One need not endorse this\ncautionary note in order to see that philosophy thrives on the\ncreative tension between, on the one hand, a tendency to abstract,\nspeculate, and formalize, and, on the other, a concern that the object\nof philosophical analysis should not be lost from sight, that\nphilosophy should not become a game of its own\u2014an abstract and\ntheoretical affair that leaves the world it purports to analyze and\nexplain far behind, using a language that can be understood only by\nits own practitioners.\n",
