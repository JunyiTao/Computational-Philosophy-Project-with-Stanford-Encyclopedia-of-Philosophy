    "main_text": "Varieties of Content || Russellian Content\n3.1 Russellian Contents\n\nSome philosophers of language defend the view that an utterance of the\nform \u2018N is F\u2019, where\n\u2018N\u2019 is an ordinary proper name, expresses a\nstructured propositional content consisting of the referent of the\nname \u2018N\u2019 and the property expressed by the\npredicate \u2018F\u2019. For instance, if the sentence\nuttered is \u2018Frida is cold\u2019, then the associated content\nwould consist in Frida herself and the property of being cold.\nContents consisting of referents of singular terms and properties\nexpressed by predicates are known as Russellian, because at\none time Russell advocated the view that singular terms contribute\nonly their referents to the proposition expressed by sentences in\nwhich they occur (or utterances of such sentences). Our example uses\nthe ordinary proper name \u2018Frida\u2019; but Russell himself\nthought that such names were not genuine singular terms, and denied\nthat public objects ever got into Russellian contents. In contemporary\ndiscussions, such contents are also called singular contents,\nbecause they include the referent of a singular term itself rather\nthan a description that picks out different objects depending on which\nthing in the world satisfies it.\n\nOne of the simplest theories of the contents of experiences says that\nexperiences have contents that are Russellian, and that these contents\nconsist of the very things that appear to have certain properties and\nthe very properties that they appear to have. For instance, if one has\na visual experience representing a red cube, the contents of\nexperience on this view would be the structured proposition containing\nthe object one sees that looks like a red cube and the property of\nbeing a red cube. This content would have the form\n[o,P], where o is the very object one is\nperceiving in having the experience, and P is the property\nthat o appears to have. Note that this is a view both about\nthe nature of the contents themselves, and about the conditions under\nwhich such experiences have them: an experience has such contents when\nthe subject is seeing an individual that appears to have the\nproperty that occurs in the content.\n\nThe strongest Russellian contents include both objects and properties.\nIn practice, the Russellian content of a complex visual experience\nmight involve a number of different objects having a conjunction of\ndifferent properties: location properties, shape properties, color\nproperties, and so on.\n\nInstead of strongly Russellian contents just described, one could\ndefine weaker Russellian contents that involve the very properties\nthings appear to have, but don\u2019t involve the very objects that\nappear to have them. These weaker Russellian contents are said to be\nexistentially quantified contents, which would be naturally\nexpressed by saying something of the form \u2018There is a red cube\nat location L\u2019. Most philosophers who defend the view\nthat experiences have Russellian contents hold that these contents are\nweaker Russellian contents. (For general discussion, see Chalmers\n2004; for discussion of the case of color, see Thau 2002, Shoemaker\n1990, 1994, 2005, Holman 2002, Maund 1995, Wright 2003.) One reason\nfor weakening contents is this way is to respect the ideas that two\nexperiences can represent the world as being the same way, even if\nthey are experiences of perceiving numerically different objects, such\nas twins. Another reason sometimes given for positing weak as opposed\nto strong Russellian contents is that two experiences can represent\nthe world as being the same way, even if one is a hallucination in\nwhich no object is perceived at all. (see e.g., Tye 1995, chapter 5,\nand Tye 2000, chapter 3). Here, though, it is important to distinguish\nthe view that contents are individuated by the objects they comprise,\nfrom the view that an experience has a Russellian content that\nincludes the object o only if the subject is perceiving the o. This\nlatter view is an optional extra (built in to the simple Russellian\nview discussed above), not entailed by the claim that experience has\nRussellian content. (Logical space has room for the view that\nhallucinations can sometimes have strong Russellian contents, as when\none hallucinates one\u2019s father, or some other particular person.\nFor discussion of this issue see McLaughlin 1989, Smith 2002, ch. 7\nand Johnston 2004).\n\nSome philosophers have argued that experiences can\u2019t have\ncolor-involving Russellian contents and can\u2019t have\nlocation-involving contents on the grounds that this would allow\nphenomenally different experiences of colors and locations to have the\nsame Russellian contents. These criticisms illustrate the appeal to\nthe phenomenal adequacy constraint on contents. More exactly, they\nappeal to a way of specifying that constraint by holding that when two\nexperiences are phenomenally the same, or are phenomenally the same in\na respect, there should be some contents that they have in common.\nThese criticisms are discussed in\n Section 4.1\n (color) and\n Section 4.2\n (location).\n",
