    "main_text": "The Domain of Intellectual Property || Copyright\n2.1 Copyright\n\nThe domain of copyright protection is original works of authorship\nfixed in any tangible medium of expression (17 U.S.C. \u00a7102\n(1988)). Works that may be copyrighted include literary, musical,\nartistic, photographic, architectural, and cinematographic works;\nmaps; and computer software. First, for something to be protected, it\nmust be fixed in a permanent or tangible medium of expression.\n For example, an expression could be chiseled into stone,\nprinted in a book, or saved on a hard drive. Second, the work\nmust be \u201coriginal\u201d\u2014the work must be the\nauthor\u2019s own production; it cannot be the result of copying\n(Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239\n(1903)). Third, copyright does not extend to short phrases, titles, or\nnames as these to do not contain the minimum amount of authorship\nrequired by copyright. A fourth requirement that limits the\ndomain of what can be copyrighted is that the expression must be\n\u201cnon-utilitarian\u201d or \u201cnon-functional\u201d in\nnature. Utilitarian products, or products that are useful for work,\nfall, if they fall anywhere, within the domain of patents. Finally,\nrights only extend over the actual concrete expression and the\nderivatives of the expression\u2014not to the abstract ideas\nthemselves. For example, Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, as\nexpressed in various articles and publications, is not protected under\ncopyright law. Someone else may read these publications and express\nthe theory in her own words and even receive a copyright for her\nparticular expression. Some may find this troubling, but such rights\nare outside the domain of copyright law. The individual who copies\nabstract theories or ideas and expresses them in her own words may be\nguilty of plagiarism, but she cannot be held liable for copyright\ninfringement.\n\nThere are five exclusive rights that copyright owners enjoy, and three\nmajor restrictions on the bundle. The five rights are: the right to\nreproduce the work, the right to adapt it or derive other works from\nit, the right to distribute copies of the work, the right to display\nthe work publicly, and the right to perform it publicly. Under U.S.\ncopyright law, each of these rights may be individually parsed out and\nsold separately by the copyright owner. All five rights lapse after\nthe lifetime of the author plus 70 years\u2014or in the case of works\nfor hire, the term is set at 95 years from publication or 120 years\nfrom creation, whichever comes first. Aside from limited duration (17\nU.S.C. \u00a7302), the rules of fair use (17 U.S.C. \u00a7107) and\nfirst sale (17 U.S.C. \u00a7109(a)) also restrict the rights of\ncopyright owners. Although the notion of \u201cfair use\u201d is\nnotoriously hard to spell out, it is a generally recognized principle\nof Anglo-American copyright law that allows anyone to make limited use\nof another\u2019s copyrighted work for such purposes as criticism,\ncomment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. For\nexample, fair use would cover a student using short quotes of\ncopyrighted material for academic purposes. The \u201cfirst\nsale\u201d rule prevents a copyright holder who has sold copies of a\nprotected work from later interfering with the subsequent sale of\nthose copies. For example, a copyright holder could not place, as a\ncondition of sale, that the work in question never be given to a\nlibrary or thrift shop. In short, the owners of copies can do\nwhat they like with their property, short of violating the copyrights\nmentioned above.\n\nAdditionally, copyright does not preclude independent creation (unlike\npatents). For example, if Smith creates a short poem and\nJones independently creates the exact same poem. Both could\nobtain copyrights to their original expressions.\n",
