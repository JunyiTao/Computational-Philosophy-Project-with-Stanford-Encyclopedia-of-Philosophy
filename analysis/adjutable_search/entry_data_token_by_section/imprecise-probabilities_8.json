    "main_text": "Motivations || Unknown correlations\n2.5 Unknown correlations\nHaenni et al. (2011) motivate\nimprecise probabilities by showing how they can arise from precise\nprobability judgements. That is, if you have a precise probability\nfor \\(X\\) and a precise probability\nfor \\(Y\\), then you can put bounds\non \\(p(X\\cap Y)\\) and \\(p(X\n\\cup Y)\\), even if you don\u2019t know\nhow \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nare related. These bounds give you intervals of possible probability\nvalues for the compound events.\nFor example, you know that \\(p(X \\cap Y)\\) is bounded above by\n\\(p(X)\\) and by \\(p(Y)\\) and thus by \\(\\min\\{p(X),p(Y)\\}\\). If\n\\(p(X) \\gt 0.5\\) and \\(p(Y) \\gt 0.5\\) then \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) must\noverlap. So \\(p(X\\cap Y)\\) is bounded below by \\(p(X)+p(Y)-1\\). But,\nby definition, \\(p(X \\cap Y)\\) is also bounded below by \\(0\\). So we\nhave the following result: if you know \\(p(X)\\) and you know \\(p(Y)\\),\nthen, you know\n\n\\[\n\\max\\{0,p(X)+p(Y)-1\\} \\le p(X \\cap Y) \\le \\min\\{p(X),p(Y)\\}.\n\\]\n\nLikewise, bounds can be put on \\(p(X \\cup Y)\\). \\(p(X\\cup Y)\\)\ncan\u2019t be bigger than when \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are disjoint, so it is\nbounded above by \\(p(X)+p(Y)\\). It is also bounded above by \\(1\\), and\nthus by the minimum of those expressions. It is also bounded below by\n\\(p(X)\\) and by \\(p(Y)\\) and thus by their maximum. Putting this\ntogether,\n\n\\[\\max\\{p(X),p(Y)\\} \\le p(X\\cup Y) \\le \\min\\{p(X)+p(Y),1\\}.\\]\n\n\n\nThese constraints are effectively what you get from de Finetti\u2019s\nFundamental Theorem of Prevision (de Finetti\n1990 [1974]: 112; Schervish, Seidenfeld, and Kadane 2008).\nSo if your evidence constrains your belief\nin \\(X\\) and in \\(Y\\),\nbut is silent on their interaction, then you will only be able to pin\ndown these compound events to certain intervals. Any choice of a\nparticular probability function will go beyond the evidence in\nassuming some particular evidential relationship\nbetween \\(X\\)\nand \\(Y\\). That\nis, \\(p(X)\\) and \\(p(X\\mid\nY)\\) will differ in a way that has no grounding in your\nevidence.\n",
