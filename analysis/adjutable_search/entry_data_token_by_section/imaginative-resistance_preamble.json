    "main_text": "\n\nThe phenomenon of \u201cimaginative resistance\u201d refers to\npsychological difficulties otherwise competent imaginers experience\nwhen engaging in particular imaginative activities prompted by works\nof fiction. Usually, we seem to have no trouble engaging with\ntime-travel or space-exploration stories, superhero movies, or talking\nnon-human animal fables. At other times, we do not seem to be able to\nplay along that easily; for instance, when we are presented with an\nalternative Macbeth where\n\n\nthe facts of [Duncan\u2019s] murder remain as they are in fact\npresented in the play, but it is prescribed in this alternate fiction\nthat this was unfortunate only for having interfered with\nMacbeth\u2019s sleep. (Moran 1994: 95)\n\n\nThe imaginative resistance debate came about as an attempt to unpack\nwhat\u2019s going on in these special, puzzling cases. It is no\nsurprise that Tamar Szab\u00f3 Gendler referred to the phenomenon as\n\u201cthe puzzle of imaginative resistance\u201d (2000). Since the\nphenomenon seems to be relatively narrow, the driving force behind\nscholars\u2019 interest in it has been the possibility of drawing\ninsights from analyses of this relatively insulated phenomenon for\nbroader, hard-to-pin-down issues, such as the ethics-aesthetics\nrelation, the nature of fiction and imagination, the functional role\nof imagination, and how imagination relates to belief and other\nstates. (See Gendler and Liao 2016: 412\u201315, for a detailed\nsurvey of various accounts that use imaginative resistance related\ninsights for solving a range of different philosophical problems.)\nHowever, as with any new and rapidly growing area of research, there\nhas been much disagreement and confusion among scholars as to the\nprecise nature of the phenomenon. Indeed, scholars disagree on\n\nwhether such a phenomenon exists;\nwhether it is really puzzling;\nwhether it is puzzling for various reasons, and if so, whether\nthese reasons are reducible to others;\nwhether we resist imagining only moral deviations or whether the\nphenomenon is broader than that;\nwhether the resistance to engaging in the imaginative activity is\na result of the subject\u2019s inability to engage in the prompted\nactivity or the subject\u2019s unwillingness to do so; and\nwhether imaginative resistance cases put constraints on our\ncognitive imagination or conative imagination, or whether they have\nnothing to do with imagination at all.\n\n\nAs Kendall Walton puts it, the only thing that has been uncontested is\nthe word \u201cof\u201d in \u201cthe puzzle of imaginative\nresistance\u201d (2006: 146).\n\nThis entry is an attempt to get clear on the central issues\nsurrounding imaginative resistance and examines the proposed solutions\nto the puzzle(s).\n",
