    "main_text": "Aesthetics || Aesthetic experience\n4.2 Aesthetic experience\n\nAesthetic responses, for Shaftesbury, involve some kind of affective\nreaction, but there is interpretative disagreement about the extent to\nwhich that affective reaction is immediate or reflective. In some\npassages, Shaftesbury seems to suggest that our sense of beauty\noperates immediately, like our sensations of color.\n\n\nNo sooner the Eye opens upon Figures, the Ear to\nSounds, than straight the Beautiful results, and\nGrace and Harmony are known and acknowledg\u2019d.\n(C 2.414)\n\nThe Shapes, Motions, Colours, and Proportions of [Bodys, or\nthe common Subjects of Sense] being presented to our Eye;\nthere necessarily results a Beauty or Deformity, according to the\ndifferent Measure, Arrangement and Disposition of their several Parts.\n(C 2.28\u20139; see also 2.285)\n\n\nStolnitz takes these passages to show that for Shaftesbury\n\u201cAesthetic response is \u2018immediate,\u2019 in the sense\nthat it takes place without discursive reflection\u201d (Stolnitz\n1961b: 198; see also 1961a: 112). In other passages, however,\nShaftesbury emphasizes the need for extensive cultivation and\nreflection in order to pass accurate aesthetic judgment (see Glauser\n2002: 45).\n\n\nTaste or Judgment \u2026 can hardly\ncome ready form\u2019d with us into the World\u2026 Use, Practice\nand Culture must precede the Understanding and Wit\nof such an advanc\u2019d Size and Growth as this. A legitimate and\njust Taste can neither be begotten, made,\nconceiv\u2019d, or produc\u2019d, without the antecedent\nLabour and Pains of Criticism.\n(C 3.164)\n\n\nShaftesbury goes on to offer an extensive defense of critics,\nmaintaining that the kind of discursive attention they give to art is\nnecessary for artistic improvement and full appreciation (C\n3.165\u20139). Such passages have led other commentators to conclude\nthat correct aesthetic taste for Shaftesbury requires well-cultivated\nreflective, discursive abilities (Rivers 2000a: 126\u20139; Darwall\n1995: 186; Townsend 1982: 210\u201312).\n\nShaftesbury clearly distinguishes between a person\u2019s\nappreciating the beauty of an object and a person\u2019s appreciating\nthe benefits an object can produce for him or herself. He writes, for\ninstance, of the obvious difference between the enjoyment of the\nbeauty of an ocean or landscape, on the one hand, and the desire to\ncommand these things and gain advantage from them, on the other (C\n2.396\u20137). He also contends that the pleasure we experience when\ncoming to appreciate beauty is\n\n\nof a kind which relates not in the least to any private\nInterest\u2026, nor has for its Object any Self-good or Advantage of\nthe private System. The Admiration, Joy, or Love, turns wholly upon\nwhat is exterior, and foreign to our-selves. (C 2.104)\n\n\nA person who is truly responding to beauty does not consider the\ndesirable consequences that may be associated with a beautiful object\nbut rather responds favorably to the object \u201cfor its own\nsake\u201d (C 2.59), based purely on \u201cthe Excellence of the\nObject\u201d (C 2.273). Such a person\u2019s response is not\nsensitive to external circumstances but results merely from\n\u201cseeing and admiring\u201d (C 2.43).\n\nOn the basis of these passages, Stolnitz argues that Shaftesbury lays\nthe groundwork for the idea that aesthetic responses are essentially\n\u201cdisinterested\u201d (Stolnitz 1961a and b; see also Glauser\n2002 and Savile 2002.) Shaftesbury, according to Stolnitz, was the\nfirst to develop this concept, which \u201cis nowhere to be found in\nclassical and medieval aesthetics. It is Shaftesbury who claims the\ndistinction of being the first thinker to bring the phenomenon of\ndisinterestedness to light and analyzing it\u201d (Stolnitz 1961a:\n100). Appreciation of beauty, on this view, has nothing to do with\nthoughts about any instrumental purpose a work of art may serve, not\nto do with the promotion of ends of any kind. Someone might value an\nartwork because it will improve morals, or make money, or teach\nhistory, or inspire religious adoration. But its aesthetic value is\nutterly distinct from any of those. \u201cAesthetic perception looks\nto no consequences ulterior to itself\u201d (Stolnitz 1961a: 108).\nAccording to this idea, which Stolnitz takes to be the defining\nfeature of modern aesthetic theory, an aesthetic response is a\nresponse solely to the intrinsic features of an object, independent of\nany other type of consideration, such as the object\u2019s utility to\nthe perceiver or to society, its moral value, or its capacity to\nincrease knowledge. Aesthetics, on this view, is autonomous,\nself-contained, impersonal, non-instrumental. Stolnitz is careful (in\na way that some of his critics have failed to note) not to claim that\nShaftesbury himself held exactly this aesthetic view. What Stolnitz\nclaims, rather, is that Shaftesbury\u2019s distinguishing of\nperceptions of beauty and judgments of self-interest was a crucial\ninfluence on the disinterested aesthetic views that would come later,\neven if Shaftesbury himself also held views that did not fit with\nthose later views (Stolnitz 1961a: 100 and 108).\n\nNumerous commentators have argued against the view that Shaftesbury\nadvances the notion of aesthetic disinterestedness (see Townsend 1982;\nRind 2002; Mortensen 1995; Arregui and Arnan 1994; White 1973;\nAxelsson 2019: 180\u20134). In contrast, they take Shaftesbury to\nhold that the value of aesthetic beauty is entirely instrumental. On\nthis anti-Stolnitzian view, Shaftesbury intends to contrast an\nappreciation of an object\u2019s beauty only with certain vicious or\nselfish concerns, not with all non-aesthetic considerations\nwhatsoever. An appreciation of beauty, on this reading of Shaftesbury,\nis \u201cnot to be identified with luxury, covetousness, avarice,\nostentation, and similar \u2026 immoral qualities\u201d (Mortensen\n1994: 637; see also Rind 2002: 72\u20133). But an appreciation of\nbeauty can and should involve consideration of virtue and the\nimprovement of moral character. Townsend says that Shaftesbury does\nnot ever truly give \u201cdisinterestedness a special significance.\nIt is not really proposed as any kind of test, nor does it\ncharacterize a special class of perceptions or judgments. It is much\nmore important to Shaftesbury to determine what our true interests\nare\u201d (Townsend 1982: 211). The editors of the Standard\nEdition write in their preface to the volume on\nShaftesbury\u2019s aesthetics, \u201cfor Shaftesbury the enjoyment\nof art was never to be an end in itself, but had always to serve a\nmoral purpose (Second Characters: 18). Derhmann says that\nShaftesbury believed that \u201dArt is merely the means to a further\nend,\u201c where that end is moral improvement\u201d (2014: 48). In\nexplicit attack on Stolnitz, Mortensen writes, \u201cOn the contrary,\nShaftesbury\u2019s aim was to situate the contemplation of art\nwithin a morality acceptable to his contemporaries\u201d (1994:\n631). According to Mortensen, Shaftesbury\u2019s goal was to give a\n\u201cmoral defense of the appreciation of art,\u201d according to\nwhich art appreciation is justified by its capacity to improve moral\ncharacter.\n\nStolnitz paints Shaftesbury as facing forward, toward the modern view\nof art for art\u2019s sake.\u201c[T]he work of art must be evaluated\nin respect of its intrinsic structure and significance, not as a moral\nvehicle\u201d; when we are in the aesthetic realm, \u201cthe ethical\nquestion withdraws\u201d (Stolnitz 1961a: 99 and 107). According to\nthese other commentators, Shaftesbury affirms the intrinsic value of\nvirtue; art has only the instrumental value of promoting virtue. They\npaint Shaftesbury as looking backward, to Stoicism. (See Tiffany 1923;\nDehrmann 2014; for discussion, see Axelsson 2019.\n\nShaftesbury contends that all appreciation of beauty is appreciation\nof mind. When we respond positively to beautiful objects, what we are\nreally responding to is the mind that designed them, not the physical\nstuff itself. \u201c[T]here is no Principle of Beauty in\nBody,\u201d he says. \u201c[T]he Beautifying, not the\nBeautify\u2019d, is the really Beautiful\u201d (C\n2.404\u20135; see also 2.426). Shaftesbury also places all beauty in\na three-part hierarchy. The lowest order of beauty belongs to\n\u201cthe dead Forms\u201d\u2014physical things such as\nmanmade works of art and natural objects (C 2.406). The second order\nof beauty belongs to human minds, or \u201cthe Forms which\nform, that is, which have intelligence, action, and\noperation\u201d (C 2.406). The third order of beauty belongs to that\n\u201cwhich forms not only such as we call mere Forms, but even\nthe Forms which form\u201d (C 2.408). This highest, most supreme\nand sovereign beauty, belongs to God, who has created everything in\nthe world, including human minds (see Kivy 2003: 12, Den Uyl 1998:\n294). With his hierarchy, Shaftesbury expresses the idea that the\nbeauty of human minds is superior to the beauty of physical objects,\nand that the beauty of God\u2019s mind is superior to the beauty of\nhuman minds, although his reasons underlying this idea are not\nperfectly clear.\n\nAdherents of the instrumentalist interpretation take\nShaftesbury\u2019s points about beauty of mind and the hierarchy as\nevidence that Shaftesbury thinks physical objects are not really\nbeautiful at all, and that we should aspire to care only about the\nbeauty of minds (see especially Tiffany 1923). On this view, the\nbeauty of objects (including all art) is merely an early stage of\nappreciation of beauty that the wise person eventually leaves behind.\nAgainst this interpretation, however, Glauser argues that\nShaftesbury\u2019s notion of beauty-as-unity implies that material\nthings can truly be beautiful, even if Shaftesbury\u2019s characters\nsometimes seem to suggest otherwise. According to Glauser\u2019s\ninterpretation of Shaftesbury, because a material thing really can\npossess a unified form, a material thing really can have the property\nof beauty. It may be a less significant kind of beauty than the beauty\nof a mind, but it can be beauty nonetheless. Because works of art\n\u201care temporarily beautified by their respective principles, they\ndo have beauty, although in some lesser measure\u201d (Glauser 2002:\n30). Glauser thinks that in the passages that seem to assert that\nmaterial things cannot possess beauty the character of Theocles has\nbeen \u201ccarried away by his own rhetoric.\u201d Other times,\nShaftesbury rightly affirms that physical things can be beautiful,\nsuch as when he has Theocles say that that \u201cwhich is\nbeautify\u2019d, is beautiful only by the accession of something\nbeautifying\u201d (C 2.404) and that what we admire is \u201cMind,\nor the Effect of Mind\u201d (C 2.405).\n\nWhatever the best interpretation may be of Shaftesbury\u2019s view of\naesthetic responses, Mortensen (1994) does marshal plentiful evidence\nthat one of Shaftesbury\u2019s chief goals was to advance a concept\nof good \u201ctaste\u201d that would improve the moral character of\nBritish gentlemen. Klein (1994) expands on this idea, showing how\nShaftesbury sought to develop the concepts of taste, manners, and\npoliteness in such a way as to provide a moral foundation for British\nlife that would supplant the outdated and unsatisfactory institutional\nsupports of church and court. Den Uyl (1998) also explicates\nShaftesbury view of the moralizing effects of the perception of\nbeauty, pointing to Shaftesbury\u2019s claims that\n\n\nto be a Virtuoso \u2026 is a higher step towards the\nbecoming a Man of Virtue and good Sense, than the being what in his\nAge we call a Scholar (C 1.333)\n\n\nand\n\n\nThus are the Arts and Virtues mutually Friends; and\nthus the Science of Virtuoso\u2019s and that of\nVirtue it-self, become, in a manner, one and the same.
