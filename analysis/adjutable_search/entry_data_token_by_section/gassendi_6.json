    "main_text": "Materialism, Libertinism, and Ethics\n7. Materialism, Libertinism, and Ethics\n\n\nThe thoroughgoing nature of Gassendi's atomism has led numerous\ncommentators from Descartes to Marx to view him as taking all worldly\nstructures and behaviors to be explicable by the interaction of\nmaterial bodies.  According to this picture, Gassendi leaves little if\nany room for the existence of non-material substance or its relevance\nto metaphysical or natural accounts. One piece of putative evidence\nfor materialism in Gassendi's corpus is his extension of atomist\nexplanation, from all physical phenomena to a large range of\nnon-physical phenomena, including aspects of the mental, social, and\nethical. This is not entirely compelling, as we have seen that the\nmaterial underpinnings of our mental apparatuses is relevant to only\nsome portion of his psychology.\n\n\nA second piece of suggestive evidence for Gassendi's materialism is\nhistoriographical and rhetorical in character. Epicurus and Lucretius\nwere the great ancient materialists, Gassendi is their great early\nmodern exponent, hence Gassendi too was a materialist\u2014his\nChurch-oriented misgivings notwithstanding. This thesis requires\nthinking of Gassendi as holding closeted views relative to the Church\nand Holy Writ, and indeed many of his views are highly nuanced in this\nregard (q.v. his stance on Galileo). It is not clear, however, that\nGassendi intends anything other than a carefully delimited set of\naccounts of materialist ilk, within what he considers to be the proper\nrealm of the physical. Strictly speaking, though, materialism is not a\ndoctrine by degrees, and that Gassendi's proposed realm of the\nmaterial extends beyond the reach of other, competing views of his\ntime does not make him a materialist in the pure sense.\n\n\nA third piece of suggestive evidence was Gassendi's membership in the\ngroup known as the libertins \u00e9rudits.  Other\nmembers of this diverse group, on a broad construal, included Guy\nPatin, Pierre Charron, Fran\u00e7ois Le Vayer La Mothe, Gabriel\nNaud\u00e9, Th\u00e9ophile de Viau, and Cyrano de Bergerac.\nMoli\u00e8re is also sometimes considered to have belonged to the\nlibertins, and he is thought to have studied under Gassendi's\ninformal tutelage (Sortais 1922). Gassendi's ties to the\nlibertins also brought him in contact with a range of other\nintellectuals and artists\u2014the latter including, most notably,\nNicolas Poussin. The libertins, constituting more of a\nliterary salon than the philosophically- and scientifically-oriented\nMersenne circle, promoted a morality determined by reason, stripped of\ntheological considerations, and defined on an individualist basis. In\ntheir commitment to intellectual liberty, they professed a diverse mix\nof metaphysical and epistemic views, especially materialism,\nskepticism, rationalism, deism, and Epicureanism\u2014each party to\nthe group offering a different mix.  They were politically and\nsocially savvy enough to promote their libertine views in a manner and\nstyle that verges on the secretive.  Such secrecy as a guiding\nstylistic force can be seen in aspects of Gassendi's writing and\nrhetorical style, as he frequently makes allusions likely to be\nunderstood only by his friends or the equally erudite, constantly\ndraws on expressions from ancient sources to make his own points, and\noffers a variety of quasi-coded rhetorical elements, most famously\nincluding his somewhat hesitant and qualified endorsement of the\nCopernican model.\n\n\nOwing to their largely individualist conception of ethics\u2014and in\nkeeping with late Renaissance tradition, the libertins tended\nto avoid political theory and larger social issues, focusing instead\non self-governance and morality understood in terms of\ncharacter. Gassendi generally follows this conception in his ethics\n(Sarasohn 1996), though he also outlines a broader political theory\n(Paganini, 1989-1990). Aside from elements of his ethics and rhetoric,\nit is an open question as to how much effect Gassendi's association\nwith the libertins had on his views\u2014or for that matter,\nhow much influence he may have had on them. In one area in\nparticular\u2014obeisance to the Church and its teachings\u2014he\ndiverges significantly from his libertin counterparts.\nGassendi routinely emphasizes the sacred nature of Holy Writ and the\nnecessity (as well as benefits) of amending Epicurean thought to meet\nstrictures of accepted dogma. This adherence suggests that Gassendi's\ninterests in personal responsibility, empirical investigation, and the\nunderlying nature of matter did not signal a consummate atheistic\nhumanism, denial of spiritual activity, or materialism. If anything,\none might suppose that his innovative ethics, scientific method, and\nphysics were artificially constrained by his canonical beliefs. A more\naccurate reading is that he trod a line between Church orthodoxies\nand the most radical alternatives associated with the mechanical\nphilosophy and early modern ethics, such as we find in\nHobbes. Gassendi was a moderate modern thinker, promoting the new\nagainst a background of opposition the potential of which he knew\nquite well.\n\n\nThough we lack grounds for calling Gassendi a complete materialist\nmoralist, a broad look at his ethics may suggest strong links to his\nphysics, in a Hobbesian manner (Sarasohn 1996). This parallel should\nnot be taken too far: Gassendi and Hobbes diverge in their views of\nhuman agency and disagree about our unfettered, non-physically\ndetermined capacity for moral deliberation. However, they each accept\nthat pleasure in some way motivates moral choice (though Gassendi also\nmakes allowance for the role of irrational appetite).\n\n\nIndeed, insofar as Gassendi considers pleasure to be a\nmaterially-realized phenomenon, he shares Hobbes's view of the morally\ncorrect as something that can be defined in physical terms.  However,\naccording to Gassendi and the lessons he draws from his Epicurean and\nStoic sources, any spirtually-related pleasure trumps any\nmaterially-related one (O II 710a-b). The truest pleasures\u2014hence\ngoods\u2014are defined along the lines of Epicurean ataraxia\n(attainment of tranquility) and Christian virtues, including in\nparticular love of God, and friendship and good will among\npersons. The guarantee of our ability to seek tranquility or fulfill\nthese virtues is our free intellectual judgment\n(libertas). Such a freedom consists in the ability of our\nintellects to choose between good and evil, and this is turn yields\nour capacity for volition, or free will (O II 821b-822b).\n\n\nFree will and the ability to exercise conscience are also key concepts\nunderlying Gassendi's views on society and the body politic. Gassendi\nagrees with Hobbes (and shares a Lucretian inspiration (Sarasohn\n1996)) that individuals in a pre-social setting are motivated by fear\nand desire for betterment, which leads them to join in a commonwealth\nand concede at least some rights. For Hobbes, this motivation is\ndriven mechanically, and the commonwealth entails foregoing individual\nrights in return for security. For Gassendi, on the other hand, the\nmotivation is driven by irreducible reasoned consideration, in favor\nof the stability of social convention. Further, this social contract\nleaves intact at least those freedoms and liberties which, to begin\nwith, figured in rational choice of the contract over the state of\nindividual insecurity. Gassendi veers from a strict physicalism,\nproposing that societies are organized by social agreements chosen\nthrough operations of the immaterial animus (O II 795a).\n",
