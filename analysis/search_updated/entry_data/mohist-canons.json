    "preamble": "\n\nThe Mohist Canons are a set of brief statements on a variety\nof philosophical and other topics by anonymous members of the\n Mohist school,\n an influential philosophical, social, and religious movement of\nChina\u2019s Warring States period (479\u2013221\n B.C.).[1]\n Written and compiled most likely between the late 4th and mid 3rd\ncentury B.C., the Canons are often referred to as the\n\u201clater Mohist\u201d or \u201cNeo-Mohist\u201d canons, since\nthey seem chronologically later than the Mohist\n \u201ctriads,\u201d\n the two dozen essays that constitute the bulk of the Mohist writings,\nwhich probably date from the mid-5th to the late 4th century. The\nCanons present philosophical ideas distinct from the older\ntexts, though clearly closely related to or evolved from them. The\nlater Mohists are also associated with the\n \u201cSchool of Names,\u201d\n a general label for ancient Chinese thinkers who were interested in\nlanguage and argumentation. Early sources link the Mohists with the\nSchool of Names through a shared interest in disputation over the\n\u201chard and white\u201d and the \u201csame and different\u201d\n(Zhuangzi, Book 33).\n\nThe Canons, their accompanying Explanations, and\nother later Mohist writings are among the most important texts in the\nhistory of Chinese ethics, philosophy of language, epistemology,\nlogic, and science. They present elements of a sophisticated semantic\ntheory, epistemology, consequentialist ethics, and theory of\nanalogical argumentation, along with intriguing discussions of\ncausality, space and time, and mereological ontology. Also recorded\nare inquiries in such diverse fields as geometry, mechanics, optics,\nand economics. The writers put forward terse, rigorous arguments that\ndevelop and defend Mohist ideas and rebut opponents\u2019 views. The\ntexts yield a rich taste of an approach to language, mind, and\nknowledge distinct from those dominant in the Western philosophical\ntradition. At the same time, by shedding light on technical notions\nemployed in other ancient writings, they confirm that a grasp of early\ntheories of language, knowledge, and argumentation is essential to a\nfull understanding of classical Chinese thought. Indeed, the later\nMohists decisively refute the once widespread view that ancient\nChinese thinkers were concerned exclusively with ethics, moral\npsychology, and nature mysticism and uninterested in language,\nepistemology, and logic. \n\nGiven the breadth and richness of later Mohist thought, this article\ncan present only a narrow sample. We will focus on a handful of core\nideas and issues in ethics, philosophy of language, epistemology,\nontology, and disputation.  (For a rough guide to the pronunciation of\nsome of the Chinese terms used in this article, see the  supplementary\n document\n Pronunciation Guide.)\n\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Background and Overview\n\nThe\n early Mohists\n hoped to develop\n objective moral standards\n by which to unify society and achieve social order. Part of their\nsolution was to develop a theory of\n f\u01ce \u6cd5 (models, standards)\n that explained how to judge distinctions (bi\u00e0n\n\u8faf) between sh\u00ec \u662f (this, right) and\nf\u0113i \u975e (not-this, wrong). The core idea was to\nidentify clear, objective f\u01ce (models) to serve as\nparadigms for pattern recognition or analogical extension. Things\nrelevantly similar to, or \u201cmatching\u201d\n(zh\u00f2ng \u4e2d), the f\u01ce would be\nsh\u00ec (right, this); anything not relevantly similar\nwould be f\u0113i (wrong, not-this). The theory of\nf\u01ce applied not only to ethics but to other areas of\nthought as well. In epistemology, for instance, it could be applied to\nexplain what it is to know something: it is knowing how to correctly\ndistinguish what does or does not match the f\u01ce for that\nsort of thing. To determine whether some claim \u2018A is\nB\u2019 should be accepted, we compare A to the\nf\u01ce for B to see whether they are similar. To\ndetermine whether some doctrine is right, we can compare it to the\n \u201cthree models\u201d\u2014the\n deeds of the sage-kings, perceptual experience, and practical\nbenefit. In logic, the theory yields a model of analogical\nargumentation. For the Mohists, an assertion is the application of a\nterm to something. To support an assertion, we cite a f\u01ce\nfor the term we are asserting and then show that the thing we are\nasserting it of is relevantly similar to the f\u01ce. In\nphilosophy of language\u2014though early Mohist texts do not\nexplicitly take this step\u2014the theory could be applied to explain\nwhy words denote the things they do. The extensions of terms are\ndetermined by social practices in which we associate f\u01ce\nwith terms and distinguish what things do or do not match the\nf\u01ce. Everything that does is thereby properly referred to\nby the term in question. \n\nAccounts can be given at several levels to explain the correctness of\nsh\u00ec/f\u0113i \u662f\u975e judgments. Most\nimmediately, sh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinctions seem to rest on\nsocial norms for distinguishing various kinds of things. This view is\nsuggested by how the Mohists describe the process by which we learn to\njudge sh\u00ec and f\u0113i: through conformity to\nthe model set by social superiors. According to the theory of the\n \u201cthree models,\u201d\n these norms for drawing distinctions rest in turn on three\nfundamental standards: the precedent set by wise leaders of the past,\nperceptual experience, and benefit to society. To some extent, then,\nthe norms have a real basis in perceptual experience and in whatever\nstrategies actually work, in practice, to promote\n\u201cbenefit,\u201d which the early Mohists understood as wealth,\npopulation, and social order. The Mohists also seem to have thought\nthey could ground at least some of these norms\u2014specifically,\nethical norms\u2014in the patterns of action exemplified by\nti\u0101n \u5929 (Heaven, nature) itself. The third of the\n\u201cthree models\u201d is also grounded in the norms that\nti\u0101n follows, specifically the norm of promoting benefit\nto all. So sh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinctions based on benefit\nare also, at least in an indirect sense, underwritten by\nti\u0101n. \n\nThe later Mohist texts present a more detailed and sophisticated\nversion of the same basic approach, grounded in the core notions of\nf\u01ce \u6cd5 (models), zh\u00f2ng \u4e2d\n(matching), sh\u00ec/f\u0113i (this/not-this)\n\u662f\u975e, and bi\u00e0n \u8faf (distinguishing).\nThey continue the search for objective standards of\nsh\u00ec/f\u0113i by which to guide action and judgment,\nand they explore numerous philosophical issues arising along the way.\nFor instance, every sh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinction divides\nthe world into what is and is not a certain thing or kind of thing.\nBut why divide things up one way rather than another? What is it about\nparticular things that makes them fall on one side of a distinction\nrather than the other? In practice, how do we make the similarity\njudgment needed to determine which side a particular thing belongs on?\nSh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinctions are associated with\n\u201cnames\u201d (m\u00edng \u540d) and thus with\nlanguage. How do these distinctions underpin language and explain\ncommunication? What is their relation to knowledge? \n\nOne important difference from earlier Mohism is that the later texts\nseem to abandon the idea of grounding ethics or social norms in\n \u201cHeaven\u2019s intention\u201d\n (ti\u0101n zh\u00ec \u5929\u5fd7), or at least they\nsay nothing about it. This move would might seem to push Mohist ethics\ntoward a form of pragmatic consequentialism: the proper standards for\nsh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinctions would be whatever tends to\npromote human welfare. Extending this idea to language and\nepistemology, we might expect the Mohists to adopt some form of\npragmatism or conventionalism, on which similarity distinctions\nbetween things are determined at least partly by human interests,\npractices, or conventions, presumably as they interact with\nhuman-independent features of the world. (One might argue that the\nearlier Mohists already held such a position concerning\nsh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinctions other than the fundamental\nethical sh\u00ec/f\u0113i identified by Heaven\u2019s\nintentions.) Yet, as Hansen suggests (1992, 242\u2013243), in a few\npassages, their position seems to lean toward a brand of realism, here\nunderstood as the view that the world in itself, independently of\nhuman activity, fixes the similarities by which things are divided\ninto kinds. It is unclear just how strong these realist tendencies\nare, however. The texts may be compatible with a view that allows some\nlatitude in the kind distinctions we recognize, provided they rest on\nat least some objective basis for distinguishing similarities and\ndifferences. \n2. The Texts\n\nOur knowledge of later Mohist thought comes from six texts, which form\nBooks 40 through 45 of the Mozi: two books of terse\n\u201ccanons\u201d (j\u012bng \u7d93), generally just a\nsentence or two in length; two of slightly longer\n\u201cexplanations\u201d (j\u012bng shu\u014d\n\u7d93\u8aaa), keyed to the canons, which provide explanations of\nor arguments for the statements in them; the \u201cGreater\nSelection\u201d (D\u00e0 Q\u01d4 \u5927\u53d6), a\ncollection of fragments on ethics, semantics, and logic, apparently\nincluding the remnants of two or more essays; and the \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d (Xi\u01ceo Q\u01d4 \u5c0f\u53d6), which\nappears to be either a coherent essay or a pair of essays. (The origin\nof the titles \u201cGreater Selection\u201d and \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d is unknown. Possibly these were two selections, one\nlonger and one shorter, from the remnants of damaged bamboo scrolls.)\nThe six books as a whole are conventionally known as the M\u00f2\nBi\u00e0n \u58a8\u8faf, or \u201cMohist\n Dialectics.\u201d[2]\n The Canons begin with 87 explications of or equivalence\nformulae for important philosophical, scientific, and mathematical\nterms. Some of these are in effect nominal definitions; others present\nsubstantive views. After a short, textually corrupt section, these are\nfollowed by 86 theses on a variety of subjects. \n\nThe content of the texts is roughly coherent but not tightly so. The\nconcepts and theories presented generally fit together well, with\nvariations in terminology. But the organization of the texts is\nunsystematic. There is no statement of their overall purpose, no clear\norganizational scheme, nor any headings indicating the themes of\ndifferent\n parts.[3]\n The canons do tend to fall into thematic groups, such as series on\nknowledge, the virtues, geometry, or argumentation, but the sequence\nof topics displays no clear pattern. Concepts are introduced only to\nnever be mentioned again, and central terms sometimes go unexplained.\nLike early Chinese mathematicians, the Mohists had no conception of an\naxiomatic system, and the canons do not clearly identify anything\ncorresponding to axioms, definitions, or theorems. Nor are they\narranged as if to explore a specified set of themes or prove some\ndistinct set of conclusions. As a result, interpretation of later\nMohist doctrines can be testing. They must be reconstructed from\nterse, incomplete statements scattered about different parts of the\ncorpus, and on some issues there is insufficient textual evidence to\nreach any firm\n conclusions.[4]\n\n\nFor a brief overview of the fascinating history of the texts and the\nphilological problems associated with them, see the following\nsupplementary document:\n\nTextual History and Philological Issues\n\n3. Ethics \n\nThe ethical theory of the Dialectics is probably a form of\nindirect consequentialism. Such a theory would be a natural\ncontinuation of earlier Mohist ethics, and it would explain why the\ntexts link morality (y\u00ec \u7fa9) to benefit\n(l\u00ec \u5229) while also specifying norms of conduct\nthat do not directly aim at benefit. This interpretation is\nnecessarily partly conjectural, however. The Dialectics\nsketch a normative theory without presenting a fundamental\njustification for it, thus leaving some uncertainty as to the nature\nof the theory\u2019s\n foundation.[5]\n The fragmentary, unsystematic nature of the texts does not allow us\nto rule out the possibility that the later Mohists held a mixed\ntheory, incorporating both consequentialist and deontological\nelements. Moreover, we should emphasize that the \u201cGreater\nSelection,\u201d in which much of the material on ethics is\ncollected, has suffered severe textual damage, hindering our efforts\nto understand details of the theory and rendering much of the\nfollowing summary tentative. \n\nAs in early\n Mohist thought,\n the core of the later Mohist ethical theory is a cluster of four\ninterrelated concepts: \u201cMorality\u201d (y\u00ec\n\u7fa9, also \u201cduty\u201d or \u201cright\u201d),\n\u201cbenefit\u201d (l\u00ec \u5229, perhaps also\n\u201cwelfare\u201d), \u201cbenevolence\u201d (r\u00e9n\n\u4ec1, also \u201ckindness\u201d or \u201chumaneness\u201d),\nand \u201ccare\u201d (\u00e0i \u611b). These notions\nare explicated more precisely than in the earlier texts, and they are\nfleshed out in ways that seem intended to rectify weaknesses in\nearlier Mohist ethics. \n\nThe texts remain committed to the Mohist doctrine of\n \u201cinclusive care\u201d\n (ji\u0101n \u00e0i \u517c\u611b), or impartial moral\nconcern for everyone, though they give no arguments to justify either\nit or the underlying consequentialist theory. Instead, they treat\ninclusive care as justified and address technical objections, such as\nwhether the notion of all-inclusive caring is logically problematic.\nFor an example of such a technical objection and the Mohists\u2019\nreply, see this supplement: \n\nCanon B73.\n \n\nCompared with early Mohist ethics, the Dialectics specify\nmore precisely what is meant by \u201cinclusive\u201d care,\nindicating that we are to have an equal degree of care for all, using\nthe same phrase that in Mohist geometry refers to two equal lengths:\n\u201cInclusive care is equal; care for each one is equal\u201d\n(EC13). At the same time, the texts clarify that the practice of\ninclusive care does not entail having equal obligations toward all or\ntreating everyone alike. The degree to which we are to seek to promote\nothers\u2019 welfare depends on our relationship to them. \n\nBesides these clarifications, later Mohist ethics introduces four\nmajor innovations. First, the texts no longer appeal to\nti\u0101n \u5929 (Heaven) as a criterion and justification\nof ethical norms. Second, they explicate benefit (l\u00ec\n\u5229) and harm (h\u00e0i \u5bb3) in terms of the\nhappiness or dislike that results from obtaining something, instead of\nthe goods of wealth, population, and order. Third, they introduce an\nexplicit code under which individuals\u2019 obligations to each other\nvary with their relationship. Fourth, they consider how benefit and\nharm are to be weighed in order to guide action in particular\ncontexts. The following subsections will discuss these four points.\n\n3.1 Heaven\n\nUnlike early Mohist texts, the Dialectics nowhere appeals to\nHeaven as a justification or epistemic criterion for moral judgment.\nHowever, it is unclear whether or not the later Mohists actually\nabandoned the doctrine of\n \u201cHeaven\u2019s intention\u201d\n (ti\u0101n zh\u00ec \u5929\u5fd7). One possibility is\nthat they set aside the doctrine after noticing the epistemic problems\ninvolved in contending that Heaven supports one set of ethical norms\nrather than another. One isolated passage seems to recognize that the\nmoral appeal to Heaven\u2019s intention as a standard of morality is\neffectively empty, as it could be twisted by a criminal to claim that\nsince Heaven (ti\u0101n \u5929, also \u201cnature\u201d)\nhas given him a criminal disposition, it is right for him to engage in\nselfish behavior (EC1). However, the passage in question is so obscure\nand corrupt that it cannot be interpreted with confidence. Another\npossibility is that the writers merely omitted the doctrine of\n\u201cHeaven\u2019s intention\u201d without actually rejecting it,\nsince their texts treat only the content of the ethical theory, not\nits foundations. Another, similarly late book of the Mozi,\n\u201cModels and Standards\u201d (Book 4), continues to appeal to\nHeaven as an ethical model, though that text may be the work of a\ndifferent branch of Mohists. \n3.2 Benefit and Happiness\n\nAs in early Mohism, \u201cbenefit\u201d (l\u00ec\n\u5229) is the fundamental standard of what is moral or right\n(y\u00ec \u7fa9), which underlies moral duties and\nvirtues: \u201cMorality is benefit\u201d (A8, B76). Benevolence\n(r\u00e9n \u4ec1, also kindness) is \u201ccaring about\nindividuals\u201d (A7). \u201cCare\u201d (\u00e0i\n\u611b) is left unexplained, though the texts indicate that the\nmorally good care constitutive of benevolence (r\u00e9n)\ninvolves caring about others for their own sake, and not as a means to\nan end (A7), and that a characteristic feature of care is desiring\nbenefit for and disliking harm to a person (EC7). \n\nEarlier Mohist texts give no simple, unified definition of benefit\n(l\u00ec \u5229), instead characterizing it loosely as an objective list of material and social goods, specifically\nwealth, population, and social order, this last good \n comprising a list of virtues and patterns of conduct. \n By contrast, the Canons\ntake happiness or delight (x\u01d0 \u559c) as a criterion\nof benefit (l\u00ec) and thus of what is morally right\n(y\u00ec): \u201cBenefit is what we get and are\nhappy\u201d (A26). Accordingly, \u201cdislike\u201d is a criterion\nof harm and thus of what is wrong: \u201cHarm is what we get and\ndislike\u201d (A27). This characterization of benefit and harm in\nterms of psychological attitudes is a remarkable shift from earlier\nMohism. The new account can probably explain the older one, insofar as\nthe Mohists might claim that wealth, population, and social order are\nbasic needs whose satisfaction makes all people happy. But the new\naccount opens up conceptual room to revise and expand Mohist ethics.\nSince what makes people happy is likely to vary in different\ncircumstances, the content of the social d\u00e0o \u9053\nmay change over time, and wealth, population, and social order may not\nbe the only goods that it aims to promote. \n\nThe Mohist appeal to happiness and dislike is interestingly different\nfrom that of classical utilitarianism in the West. Utilitarians such\nas Bentham and Mill held a hedonistic theory of value, on which\nhappiness is the fundamental good. Moral value for them lies in\nmaximizing happiness. For the Mohists, by contrast, happiness is not a\nfundamental good, but a criterion by which to identify the goods that\nconstitute benefit. Their theory thus sidesteps a well-known criticism\nof hedonistic theories of value, namely that happiness is an\nunconvincing explanation of or basis for moral value, since it\ngenerally is not a fundamental good but a byproduct of our achieving\nother goods. \n\nOn the other hand, the Mohists seem to assume without discussion that\nwhat is genuinely to our benefit will make us happy and that what\nmakes us happy will be beneficial and morally right. Both of these\npoints are open to question. A critic might object, for instance, that\nthere may be goods that produce benefit without delighting us or\nthings that produce delight without genuinely benefiting us (heroin\nuse being a standard example). In the Mohists\u2019 defense, one\nmight argue that all goods at least produce some general feeling of\nsatisfaction, if not delight, and that things that do not genuinely\nbenefit us produce at best only a transient, unstable, or otherwise\ndeficient form of satisfaction or delight. Under critical scrutiny,\nthen, the Mohists\u2019 explanation of benefit seems\npromising\u2014there may well be a connection, perhaps even a\nnecessary one, between benefit and some form of psychological\nsatisfactoriness\u2014but it probably needs to be revised or\ndeveloped further. \n\nWhose benefit counts in determining what morality (y\u00ec\n\u7fa9) is, and what are the scope of our moral duties? The Mohists\nhold that everyone\u2019s benefit counts equally in determining what\nconduct or practices are right or wrong. As individuals, though, we\nmay not each have a duty to treat everyone equally. In our basic\nmotivations or intentions (zh\u00ec \u5fd7), we are to\ntake \u201call under Heaven\u201d\u2014the world of living\nthings\u2014as our \u201cportion\u201d (f\u00e8n\n\u4efd), or scope of responsibility, whose benefit we are committed\nto promoting (A8). But provided we are committed to the benefit of all\nand capable of acting on our commitment when the chance arises, we\nneed not actually benefit everyone. Individuals\u2019 moral worth is\ndetermined not by how much they actually benefit the world, which may\nbe beyond their control (they may die young, for instance (EC3)), but\nby their intentions and abilities, which are largely within their\ncontrol. (The Mohists may recognize an exception to this rule in the\ncase of moral heroes, such as the ancient sage king Yu, whose moral\nworth surpasses other people\u2019s.) Unless we hold high political\noffice or are responding to an emergency, most of us will not have the\nchance to benefit the whole world directly and need not try to do\nso.\n\nInstead, the extent to which we should seek to benefit others will\nnormally depend on our relationship to them. The Mohists propose that\nour conduct toward others be guided by a code of responsibilities\nassociated with various relationships, which they plausibly would have\nregarded as justified by its efficacy in promoting the welfare of all.\nThis code is an articulation of the earlier Mohists\u2019 commitment\nto the virtues associated with the paradigm social relations of ruler,\nsubject, father, son, and brother. It may also have been a response to\nthe criticism that impartial care for all undermines special personal\nrelationships, which most of us agree are of great value. The Mohists\noften expressed their doctrine of all-inclusive care as \u201ccaring\nabout others\u2019 as one cares about one\u2019s own,\u201d a\nformulation open to the uncharitable construal that, for instance, one\nshould treat everyone else\u2019s father as having a status identical\nto one\u2019s own. As the Mohists\u2019 critics were quick to point\nout, the result would be that we fail to treat our father as our\nfather, rather than simply as one male elder among others. On\nthese grounds, Mencius, one of the Mohists\u2019 Confucian opponents,\nclaimed that the Mohist doctrine was tantamount to denying one\u2019s\nfather. The Mohists themselves clearly did not consider this a\nconsequence of their position, which they repeatedly indicated was\ncompatible with filial devotion (xi\u00e0o \u5b5d). But\nto settle the issue, an explicit account was needed of the role of\nspecial personal relationships in their ethics.\n3.3 Relation Ranking\n\nPerhaps partly to answer such critics, the later Mohists developed a\ndoctrine they called \u201crelation ranking\u201d (l\u00fan\nli\u00e8 \u502b\u5217). This is a code according to which\nwe are to care for everyone while benefiting some people more and\nothers less, in proportion to their relation to us. Our different\nobligations to people are determined by general standards of morality\n(y\u00ec)\u2014most likely, by conforming to the social\nd\u00e0o (conventional practices) that best promotes the benefit of all.\n\u201cDoing more for those whom morality (y\u00ec\n\u7fa9) permits doing more for and less for those whom morality\npermits doing less for is called \u2018relation\nranking.\u2019\u2026If the kinship is close, do more; if the\nkinship is distant, do less\u201d (EC9). Those for whom we are to do\nmore include the sovereign, government officers, elders, and relatives\n(EC9). Inclusive care thus does not entail equal treatment of or\nobligations to others. In practice, the later Mohist view would\nprobably coincide roughly with the view attributed to a Mohist named\nYi Zhi in a dialogue in the Mencius (3A5): \u201cIn care, no\ndegrees; in practice, begin from one\u2019s parents.\u201d \n\nAnother fragment indicates that we ourselves are among those for whom\nwe are to do more: \u201cCaring about [other] people does not exclude\noneself; oneself is among those one cares about\u2026. Caring about\noneself according to relation ranking is \u2018caring about\npeople\u2019\u201d (EC10). So the Mohists were not committed to\nselfless altruism. As long as we do not exceed the degree stipulated\nby morality (y\u00ec), doing more for ourselves and our\ncircle than for outsiders does not count as selfishness, but as\nconformity with the moral norm of all-inclusive care for all. On the\nother hand, benefiting some people more and others less without\nconforming to \u201crelation ranking\u201d is acting \u201cfor the\nsake of oneself\u201d (EC10) rather than on behalf of all, as\nmorality requires. \n\nThe texts provide enough detail about \u201crelation ranking\u201d\nfor us to speculate that later Mohist ethics is consequentialist at\nthe foundational level. Given the statements that morality\n(y\u00ec) is benefit (l\u00ec) (A8), that in our\ncommitments, we are to take all the world as our\n\u201cportion,\u201d or object of responsibility (A8), and that care\nfor all is to be equal (EC13), the most explanatorily powerful\nhypothesis for the empirical content of those texts is that the theory\nis foundationally consequentialist. \u201cRelation ranking\u201d was\nthus probably justified as a code of conduct on the grounds that its\npractice best promoted the welfare of all, making later Mohist ethics\na form of indirect social-practice consequentialism. The Mohist\nposition would have been that in practice the welfare of all is best\nsecured by having everyone follow conventional relationship-roles\nwhere the whole social system leads to more universal well-being that\nan alternate set of social practices. So doing more for closer\nrelations and less for distant would still be moral where everyone\nfollowed that convention, e.g. the elderly would generally have been\nmore effectively cared for by their children, who loved them and\nbetter understood their needs, than by strangers. So equal concern for\nthe welfare of all would have justified a code in which individuals\nprovided primarily for their own elderly parents, not others\u2019.\nThis social d\u00e0o could have been expected to meet the needs of most\nelderly, so it would have been unnecessary for everyone to provide\nequal benefits for other people\u2019s parents. Outside of the\nfamily, generally only orphans and the childless elderly would have\nrequired help. The Mohists probably expected the burden of caring for\nthem to be split across society, with the relatively well-off\ncontributing from their surplus resources. \n\n\u201cRelation ranking\u201d would thus have generated a system of\npractices and duties based on social relations that was largely\ncongruent with the role-based duties recognized by the Ru\n(\u201cerudites,\u201d or Confucians), the Mohists\u2019 main\nopponents. The major difference would have been in how the two schools\ngrounded their views. Confucian ethics starts with a conception of the\nconduct appropriate to persons standing in various types of\nrelationships and works outward, proposing an ideal by which persons\nextend concern for their in-group to embrace outsiders. Mohist ethics\nstarts from the conviction that the only objectively or impartially\njustified f\u01ce (model or standard) of conduct is to\npromote the welfare of all. It then works downward, proposing a code\nof practices associated with particular social relations that, if\ngenerally followed, would best promote everyone\u2019s welfare. The\ngeneral f\u01ce (model) of promoting the welfare of all and\nthe practices it grounds function as reasons for action analogous to\nmoral principles. In the structure of the Mohist theory, however, they\nare conceptualized not as universal principles, applied by deductive\nreasoning, but as models or exemplars, applied by pattern recognition\nand analogical reasoning, against which we compare social practices or\nindividual conduct to determine what is sh\u00ec (right)\nand f\u0113i (wrong). \n\nOn this interpretation, then, the later Mohist ethical theory is a\nplausible form of indirect consequentialism, though its formal\nstructure is distinct from familiar forms of rule consequentialism in\nfocusing on models and social practices rather than rules or\nprinciples. However, one of the\n problems\n with early Mohist ethics arises again in the later, more\nsophisticated theory. According to \u201crelation ranking,\u201d we\nare to do more to benefit those closest to us. But, consistent with\nearlier statements of the doctrine of inclusive care, the later\nMohists also hold that we should care equally for all of humanity. Our\ntreatment of others is to vary with their relation to us, but our\ndegree of care for them is not. For example, though we are to devote\nmore resources to ourselves than to distant strangers, there is to be\nno difference in the strength of our care (ai) for ourselves\nand for them (EC10). We are to be as concerned for others\u2019\nparents as for our own (EC12). Inclusive care is equal for all, and\ncare about each person should be equal (EC13); the degree of\n\u201ccare about others\u201d that we direct toward one individual\nis to be the same as that we direct toward any other (EC2). Indeed,\nwere the whole world to be harmed by the death of one individual, we\nwould expend vastly more effort looking after that person, but our\ndegree of moral care would not increase\n (EC4).[6]\n On the other hand, concern for an individual cannot be abandoned,\neven if the world were to benefit (EC2). \n\nA critic might charge that this doctrine commits the Mohists to a\ncounterintuitive split between the level of treatment we provide to\nothers and the degree to which we care about their welfare. A more\nnatural approach, the critic might argue, would be to allow the degree\nof care to vary with the closeness of the relationship, with the\nproviso that even distant strangers be the object of at least a\nminimal degree of care. This approach might allow individuals to\nperform the social roles of government official, subject, parent,\nchild, and so forth more effectively, thus promoting the welfare of\nall. One might also question whether the costs of training everyone to\nmaintain an equal degree of care for everyone else would not be too\nhigh, and whether it would even be psychologically feasible for us to\ndevote more time, attention, and assistance to those closest to us\nwithout also caring more about them. In the Mohists\u2019 defense,\nhowever, we might argue that by \u201ccare\u201d (\u00e0i\n\u611b) they seem to be referring primarily to a social attitude of\nmoral regard or consideration, not one of individual, affective\nconcern or attachment. For they see equal care as compatible with\nfilial devotion (xi\u00e0o \u5b5d) and parental\ncompassion (c\u00ed \u6148), virtues normally associated\nwith special affective concern for one\u2019s parents or children,\nand they tie the absence of care to utter disregard for others\n(Mozi, Books 14\u201316). If in fact \u201ccare\u201d here\ncorresponds to moral consideration, then the Mohists may be on firm\nground in advocating equal care for all. On the other hand, if\n\u201ccare\u201d does refer primarily to an affective attitude, the\ndoctrine of \u201crelation ranking\u201d could easily be modified to\nallow different degrees of care on the same consequentialist grounds\nthat justify different degrees of benefit: doing so would better\npromote the welfare of all. Alternatively, the Mohists could recast\nthe doctrine of equal care as a doctrine about moral justification:\nInstitutions and practices are to be justified on the grounds that\nthey reflect equal concern for the welfare of all. Educating people to\nthink of justification in this way would probably be feasible; indeed,\nit might correspond largely to what we think of as commonsense moral\neducation. \n\nThough the Mohists advocate concern for all, it is unclear to what\nextent they endorse respect for the life or dignity of individuals. On\nthe one hand, care about an individual cannot be abandoned, even if\nthe world were to benefit (EC2). But one fragment in the\nDialectics states, \u201cCaring about them equally, select\nand execute one person among them,\u201d and \u201cif the benefit to\nthe world is equal, then there\u2019s no choosing between them. If\nthe benefit of death and life are as one, then there\u2019s no\nchoosing between them\u201d (EC6). Given their lack of context, any\ninterpretation of these remarks must be tentative. But they might be\ntaken to suggest that the only fundamental consideration in Mohist\nethics is the greater benefit of all the world, not respect for\nindividuals\u2019 dignity or the intrinsic value of their lives.\nThese remarks might seem to permit sacrificing an individual to\nincrease overall welfare, or even just as long as there is no net\ndecrease in welfare. However, the same fragment continues,\n\u201cKilling a person to save the world, it\u2019s not that we kill\na person to benefit the world; killing oneself to save the world,\nit\u2019s that one kills oneself to benefit the world.\u201d This\nseems to indicate that even in the extreme case in which we can save\nthe world by sacrificing another\u2019s life, we do so not merely on\nthe grounds of the net benefit to the world, since adopting such\ngrounds might suggest that we could routinely sacrifice individuals\nfor the benefit of society in less extreme cases as well. Rather, we\ndo so because of the massive discrepancy between the harm we inflict\nand that we prevent\u2014the loss of a single life versus loss of the\nwhole world. If the life to be given up is our own, on the other hand,\nthe fragment seems to imply that we should make the sacrifice on the\ngrounds of benefiting the world, though only if the consequences are\nsuitably weighty.\n3.4 Practical Reasoning\n\nThe fourth area of novelty in the ethics of the Dialectics\nconcerns an aspect of practical reasoning that the Mohists call\n\u201cweighing\u201d (qu\u00e1n\n \u6b0a).[7]\n \u201cWeighing\u201d typically involves judging which of several\nalternative ends or courses of action is of greater benefit and lesser\nharm, and thus should determine how we act. The discussion of\n\u201cweighing\u201d is a response to two sorts of issues. One is\nhow to handle conflicts between competing ends or values. The other is\nhow to choose the best means of dealing with situations in which no\ncourse of action open to us is prima facie beneficial or\nright. Early Mohist texts contain no discussion of how benefit is to\nbe aggregated or maximized\u2014how the different elements of benefit\nare to be weighed against each other and combined so as to best\npromote the benefit of all. The later Mohist discussion of weighing\ncan be seen as addressing this issue on the basis of the principle of\nfavoring the greater part of a whole and thus choosing the greater of\ntwo benefits or the lesser of two harms.\n\nThe Mohists identify two forms of \u201cweighing.\u201d The first\nappears to be weighing of ends or things for which we act (the phrase\nin the text is \u201cthings treated as units\u201d) (EC8). This sort\nof judgment is what the text calls weighing proper\n(qu\u00e1n). The second appears to be weighing of means\n(the phrase reads \u201caffairs and action\u201d). The text deems\nthis process \u201cseeking\u201d (qi\u00fa \u6c42), a\nterm used elsewhere to explicate deliberation (see the section on\n epistemology\n below). It seems to refer to deliberation or planning about the\ncourse of action that would best achieve some end. \n\nIn principle, most action requires practical judgment, since general\nethical standards alone are usually insufficient to guide action in\nconcrete situations. But the cases that draw the Mohists\u2019 (and\nother ancient Chinese writers\u2019) attention are those in which\ndifferent values or ethical standards conflict, pulling the agent in\ndifferent directions, along with those in which one is forced to act\nwhen none of the available alternatives would normally justify or\nmotivate action. The Mohists were particularly concerned to explain\nhow their fundamental standard of benefit (l\u00ec) could\nguide action even when by normal standards none of the choices\navailable are beneficial. \n\nAccording to the Mohists, the ends for which we act may be\ndistinguished as sh\u00ec (right) or f\u0113i\n(wrong) in two ways, either \u201cdirectly\u201d or by\n\u201cweighing\u201d (EC8). In a particular instance, for example,\nwe might directly judge that something we normally take to be\nf\u0113i is indeed f\u0113i, or we might weigh the\nfeatures of the situation and conclude that in this special case\nsomething normally f\u0113i is actually sh\u00ec.\nSimilarly, desires and aversions may form in two ways. We may desire\nor dislike something directly or after weighing the benefits and harms\nof the available alternatives (A84). An example of the latter sort of\ndesire is a desire for the lesser of two harms, which one might form\nafter \u201cweighing benefit.\u201d The Mohists consider the case of\na traveler captured by robbers who force him to choose between\nsacrificing his finger, his arm, or his life (EC8). Clearly, the\ntraveler will sacrifice his finger, not his arm or his life. In\nabsolute terms, he is choosing something harmful. But as the Mohists\nsee it, selecting the lesser among harms counts as selecting benefit,\nnot harm. They point out that the agent\u2019s choices are not fully\nwithin his control. Forced to choose among harms, he selects the least\nharmful option. When compelled to give up something we possess, we\nchoose the least harmful alternative. When free to select something we\ndo not yet possess, we choose the most beneficial alternative. Either\nway, we still count as selecting benefit, not harm (EC8). \n\nThe decision-making procedure depicted in the discussion of\n\u201cweighing\u201d is tantamount to act consequentialism. However,\nas we have seen, later Mohist ethics overall seems to be a version of\nindirect consequentialism, in which actions are guided and justified\nby practices that are in turn justified by appeal to their beneficial\nconsequences. The basic standard for\n\u201cweighing\u201d\u2014\u201camong benefits, select the\ngreatest; among harms, select the smallest\u201d (EC8)\u2014appears\nto be a rule for resolving conflicts between standards or goods or for\nguiding action in exigent cases not covered by familiar moral norms.\n\n4. Philosophy of Language\n\nThe later Mohists develop a sophisticated naturalistic semantic theory\nthat explains reference, and thus communication, by appeal to\nspeakers\u2019 shared capacity to learn to distinguish different\nkinds of things on the basis of their characteristic features. As in\nthe Analects, the other parts of the Mozi, and the\nXunzi, theoretical attention focuses on the issue of applying\nnames or terms to things correctly, and not on the structure or truth\nof sentences. (The \u201cLesser Selection\u201d moves on to consider\n\u201cexpressions\u201d (c\u00ed \u8fad) formed of\nstrings of words, but these are treated along the same lines as\nterms.) Unlike traditional Western theories of language, such as\nLockean conceptualism, the Mohists do not explain the relation between\nlanguage and the world by appeal to mental ideas or meanings that\nwords stand for. Instead, speakers are understood to communicate by\nmastering practices for distinguishing (bi\u00e0n \u8faf)\nthe referents of names for various kinds of things. By virtue of these\npractices, members of the same language community know that each\ngeneral term stands for all similar things of a certain kind\n(l\u00e8i \u985e). \n4.1 Names and Stuff\n\nThe Mohists regard all words as various types of \u201cnames\u201d\n(m\u00edng \u540d). They draw no distinction between\ndifferent parts of speech, probably because classical Chinese words\nhave no obvious morphological features to indicate their different\ngrammatical functions. They do identify three types of names,\naccording to the scope of their denotation (A78):\n\u201call-reaching\u201d names, such as \u2018thing\u2019\n(w\u00f9 \u7269), \u201creach to\u201d or denote\nanything. \u201cKind\u201d (l\u00e8i \u985e) names,\nsuch as \u2018horse\u2019, consistently \u201cproceed to\u201d\n(x\u00edng \u884c, go on to be consistently predicable of) all things relevantly similar to each\nother. \u201cPersonal\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d\nnames, such as the proper noun \u2018Jack\u2019,\n\u201cstop\u201d in one thing only, the individual that bears the\nname. Kind names are in effect general terms. They are established by\ndubbing things of a certain kind by that name. Having named something\n\u201chorse,\u201d for example, we are committed to applying the\nsame name to all similar things (A78). (As we will see in section 6, the Mohists also seem to recognize how some general terms might refer to things grouped together on grounds other than being members of the same kind.) \n\nNames are used to talk about various sh\u00ed \u5be6\n(stuff, things, objects, reality). \u2018Sh\u00ed\u2019\ncan be interpreted as roughly \u201cstuff\u201d or\n\u201csolid\u201d and has the connotation of \u201creal\u201d and\n\u201cfull.\u201d Sh\u00ed has a semantic range similar\nto, but broader than, the English \u2018thing\u2019,\n\u2018object\u2019, or \u2018stuff\u2019. It may refer to physical\nobjects, conduct, events, or situations. It is also used to refer to\n\u201cthe facts,\u201d the reality or genuine character of\nsomething, and the actual conduct or ability that matches or warrants\na\n reputation.[8]\n According to ancient Chinese beliefs about nature, everything in the\ncosmos consists of a dynamic, flowing elemental stuff called\nq\u00ec \u6c23 (breath or vapor). When used to refer to\nobjects, sh\u00ed in effect refers to regions where\nq\u00ec has condensed and thickened to fill out space and\nform a solid. The use to refer to \u201creality\u201d or \u201cthe\nfacts\u201d seems to be an extension of this use; in both cases,\nsh\u00ed refers to what is really, solidly there. \n\nAs an object or what is real or factual, sh\u00ed contrasts\nnot with \u201csubject\u201d or \u201csubjective,\u201d but with\nx\u016b \u865b (empty, hollow, insubstantial,\nindeterminate) or with m\u00edng \u540d (name), the\nlinguistic label for the thing referred to. Nor is sh\u00ed\n\u201csubstance,\u201d as contrasted with a set of properties that\nare in, possessed by, or realized by it. What we think of as the\nproperties of a sh\u00ed are all just inherent parts of it.\nInstead of positing an essence or a set of essential properities\ninstantiated by all things of a kind, the Mohists take it as a brute\nfact that sh\u00ed may be similar or different in various\nrespects, and they seek criteria by which to divide them into kinds\nbased on these similarities and differences. As we will discuss when\nwe consider the notions of\n \u201csame\u201d and\n  \u201cdifferent,\u201d\n features they cite as such criteria include \u201cshape and\nlook\u201d (x\u00edng m\u00e0o \u5f62\u8c8c),\n\u201cresidence and migration\u201d (j\u016b y\u00f9n\n\u5c45\u904b), and \u201camount and number\u201d\n(li\u00e0ng sh\u00f9 \u91cf\u6578) (NO2). Whether a\nparticular thing falls within a certain kind, and thus takes a certain\nname, such as \u2018horse\u2019, is determined by comparing it with\na f\u01ce \u6cd5 (model, exemplar) of that kind to see\nwhether they are similar (A70). A particular horse counts a horse\nbecause its \u201clook\u201d or \u201ccharacteristics\u201d\n(m\u00e0o \u8c8c) are \u201clike the model\u201d (A71).\nAs we will see, in some places, the writers of the Canons\nseem to assume that such similarity relations are fixed by nature,\nthough they do not give an explicit defense of this stance. \n\nThe Mohists identify three kinds of \u201ccalling\u201d\n(w\u00e8i \u8b02) (A79), or the speech act of uttering\nnames. The first, \u201cdesignating,\u201d refers to\n\u201clinking\u201d (l\u00ec \u7051/\u5137) two or\nmore names together, as when we say \u201cdogs are hounds.\u201d The\ntext leaves it unclear whether it is referring to predication in\ngeneral, noun predication, or merely introducing a new name for\nsomething, since other passages indicate that \u2018dog\u2019 and\n\u2018hound\u2019 were considered coextensive. Probably the writers\ndo not distinguish clearly between these different cases, and it is\nlikely they are referring generally to all instances of noun\npredication, if not also verbal predication. A second kind of\n\u201ccalling,\u201d \u201capplying\u201d or\n\u201cattaching\u201d (ji\u0101 \u52a0), is illustrated\nby scolding a dog. Other passages in the Mozi suggest that\n\u201capplying\u201d refers to using a term of approval or\ndisapproval of someone in order to praise or reproach the person. One\npossibility, though speculative, is that \u201capplying\u201d might\nrefer to adjectival predication. The third type of speech act is\n\u201cpresenting\u201d (j\u01d4 \u8209, also\n\u201cbringing up\u201d or \u201craising\u201d), which is\nusing a name to talk about something. For instance, uttering the word\n\u2018dog\u2019 or \u2018hound\u2019 is \u201cpresenting\u201d\ndogs or hounds.\n4.2 \u201cPresenting\u201d and Communication\n\nSpeaking or \u201cstating\u201d (y\u00e1n \u8a00) in\ngeneral consists of a series of \u201cpresentings\u201d (A32).\n\u201cPresenting\u201d something is explained as a form of\n\u201cemulating\u201d or \u201cpresenting a model for\u201d it\n(A31). The Mohist view seems to be that names function as models of\ntheir referents, in effect \u201cshowing\u201d others what the\nspeaker is talking about (B53). Using a name of something is\n\u201cdescribing\u201d or \u201ccharacterizing\u201d\n(m\u00e0o \u8c8c) it, just as if we drew a picture of it\n(A32). (This idea might be motivated by the pictographic roots of\nChinese writing.) If we \u201cpresent\u201d our friend as an example\nof a rich merchant, then we are using our friend\u2019s name to show\nwhat a rich merchant is (B53). \n\n\u201cPresenting\u201d (j\u01d4 \u8209) is related to but\ndistinct from the contemporary concept of reference or denotation.\nWords can refer to or denote objects, but names cannot\n\u201cpresent\u201d sh\u00ed (objects, reality). Rather,\nspeakers use names to \u201cpresent\u201d\nsh\u00ed \u5be6. English concepts similar to\nj\u01d4 \u8209 include \u201craise\u201d and \u201cbring\nup,\u201d as in sentences such as \u201cMary raised a question\u201d\nnd \u201cMary brought up a possible candidate for the job.\u201d\nIn contexts where we might speak of a word or a speaker\nreferring to an object, early Chinese texts typically use the\nexpressions zh\u01d0 \u6307 (point, indicate)\nor w\u00e8i \u8b02 (call) instead of\nj\u01d4 \u8209 (present, bring up). \n\nThe Mohists\u2019 theory that using names to talk about things is a\nmatter of modeling them can be seen as one version of the commonsense\nidea that words represent or signify things. But the Mohist notion of\n\u201cemulating\u201d (n\u01d0 \u64ec) goes beyond this\nbasic idea. It is part of a broader theory that names of\nkinds\u2014general terms\u2014enable us to communicate by appeal to\nshared practices for distinguishing similar from different kinds of\nthings. On the Mohist view, words can represent things because they\nshow us what the thing the speaker \u201cpresents\u201d is \u201cthe same\nas\u201d (t\u00f3ng \u540c). They show us this because\nwe have previously learned to distinguish the similar kind\n(l\u00e8i \u985e) of thing denoted by that name. Given\nthis background learning, language tells us what something is\n\u201clike\u201d (ru\u00f2 \u82e5) and thus enables us\nto know (zh\u012b \u77e5) the thing (B70). When someone\nuses a word to present something, we know that thing is \u201cthe\nsame\u201d as other things denoted by that word. Hence using words is\na process of \u201cusing what people understand to rectify what they\ndon\u2019t know\u201d (B70). The Mohists compare this to using a\nmeasuring tool. We can use a ruler to measure length because we know\nthe length of the marks on the ruler and we see that the thing\nmeasured is the same length as one of the marks. Analogously, through\nlanguage, we can use what listeners are familiar with to inform them\nabout what they don\u2019t know. By using a name of something, we\nindicate that the thing is relevantly similar to the other things\nconventionally referred to by that name. When we say something is\n\u201cwhite,\u201d we are indicating that it is the same color as\nthe other things we call \u201cwhite.\u201d By grasping the\nreference of each other\u2019s words in this way, we are able to\n\u201cconnect thoughts\u201d (t\u014dng y\u00ec\n\u901a\u610f) (B41) and thus to communicate. \n\nAs this conception of communication as \u201cconnecting\nthoughts\u201d suggests, the Mohists see language as enabling\nspeakers to express their y\u00ec \u610f (thought,\nintention, point) (A92), a view shared by other early Chinese theories\nof language, including those of the Xunzi and The Annals\nof Lu Buwei. However, the role of \u201cthought\u201d or\n\u201cintention\u201d (y\u00ec \u610f) in these ancient\nChinese theories is distinct from that of ideas, meanings, or\nintensions in certain familiar Western views. In Western folk\ntheory\u2014what we might call the Idea Theory or a\n \u201cdog-legged\u201d[9]\n theory of language\u2014a word\u2019s meaning is the mental idea it\nstands for, which in turn represents some object in the world. The\ncontent of the idea explains why the word is used as it is, such as\nwhy it refers to certain things and not others. A well-known\ndifficulty with this view is that it merely moves the explanandum back\na step, since the content and function of ideas, a set of inner,\nprivate symbols, is just as much in need of explication as the content\nand function of language, a set of outer, public ones. The Mohist\ntheory makes no detour through ideas or other mental entities to\nexplain semantic content. Instead, the reference of words is explained\nby similarity relations and by practices for distinguishing the kind\nof thing designated by each word. The thought (y\u00ec\n\u610f) expressed by language does not explain why words are used as\nthey are. Rather, the way words are used explains how it is that they\ncan express thoughts. \u201cExpressing thoughts\u201d (sh\u016b\ny\u00ec \u6292\u610f) (NO11) or \u201cconnecting\nthoughts\u201d (t\u014dng y\u00ec \u901a\u610f) (B41)\nis communication, the aim or result of using language, not an\nexplanation of why terms refer to the things they do. One canon (B41)\ndepicts a scenario in which we come to understand the thought\n(y\u00ec \u610f) of a speaker who uses an unfamiliar word\nby asking to what the word refers. The point is that if we can\ndetermine reference, we can communicate. There is no need to consider\nmeanings or \u201cideas\u201d corresponding to words, and indeed\nintensional concepts play no role in the Mohist theory. \n\nAccordingly, y\u00ec \u610f (thought) is typically\nassociated not with words (m\u00edng \u540d, names), as\none would expect if Chinese thinkers held an Idea Theory of meaning,\nbut with \u201cstatements\u201d (y\u00e1n \u8a00) and\n\u201cexpressions\u201d (c\u00ed \u8fad). (An\n\u201cexpression,\u201d in ancient Chinese philosophy of language,\nis any string of two or more words used to communicate a thought.)\nUnderstanding the y\u00ec (thought) expressed by an\nassertion or command is in effect \u201cgetting the point.\u201d For\nthis reason, in some contexts y\u00ec (thought) plays a\nconceptual role resembling that of \u201cspeaker\u2019s\n meaning.\u201d[10]\n However, other passages suggest that it is not a semantic notion at\nall, but more akin to \u201cwhat one is thinking\u201d or\none\u2019s intentions. One canon tells us that \u201ctrustworthiness\nis statements agreeing with y\u00ec (thought)\u201d (A14),\na remark that is difficult to understand if y\u00ec is\ninterpreted as a semantic concept. For if y\u00ec (thought)\nwere speaker\u2019s meaning, then what speakers say could not fail to\nagree with their y\u00ec, and if it were literal meaning,\nthen failing to conform to it would show only that the speakers use\nwords incorrectly, not that they are untrustworthy. People are\ntrustworthy when what they say genuinely reflects what they have in\nmind, particularly what they intend to do. The best interpretation of\ny\u00ec in contexts concerning language, then, seems to be\nas a general notion of \u201cthought\u201d or a more specific notion\nof \u201cintention,\u201d and not as semantic\n meaning.[11]\n\n\nTo sum up, the Dialectics presents a theory of language on\nwhich reference is explained by speakers\u2019 associating\n\u201cnames\u201d with kinds of similar objects, events, or\nsituations (sh\u00ed \u5be6). Communication is explained\nby language users\u2019 familiarity with the kinds of similar things\nreferred to by \u201cnames.\u201d The relation between language and\nthe world is not explained by appeal to meanings, ideas, or concepts\nin the mind, nor abstract essences of things, but by practices for\ndistinguishing different kinds of similar objects. This naturalistic\ntheory seems highly plausible, as far as it goes. But it raises\nseveral crucial questions: How should things be divided into kinds?\nWhat makes things belong to one kind or another? What justifies\nrecognizing certain kinds rather than others? As we will see, a\nweakness in later Mohist thought is that they leave these questions\npartly unanswered. Their texts make it clear that they recognize the\nissues. Yet they lack an explicit, principled explanation of what\nsimilarities and differences should count in distinguishing kinds of\nthings and why. \n\nThese questions pertain not only to the Mohists\u2019 philosophy of\nlanguage, but to their epistemology. So before addressing them, we\nwill survey later Mohist epistemology and its relation to semantic\ntheory. \n5. Epistemology\n\nAs in early\n Mohist thought,\n the focus of later Mohist epistemology is not on the justification or\ntruth of beliefs, or propositional attitudes, but on knowing how to\ndistinguish which things or situations are sh\u00ec\n\u662f (this) for some term and which are f\u0113i \u975e\n(not-this). As in the earlier texts, the core expression of knowledge\nis knowing how to apply terms to things correctly. However, the\nDialectics identifies new aspects of knowledge to explain\ncases such as when someone is able to make a correct assertion about\nsomething but not to identify it perceptually or when someone can\nrecognize a thing under one name but not another. \n\nThe core of later Mohist epistemology is presented in two places, a\ngroup of canons describing basic cognitive functions (A3\u20136) and\nanother canon listing sources and types of knowledge (A80). It is not\nentirely clear how, or whether, the doctrines presented in the two\nplaces fit together as a system. (The texts make no attempt to link\nthe two, and Canon A80 treats aspects of knowledge that do not mesh\ndirectly with the account in A3\u2013A6.) But they do give a\nreasonably informative picture of the later Mohists\u2019 approach to\nknowledge. \n5.1 Awareness, Knowing, and Understanding\n\nHumans who are alive and awake have a capacity or resource\n(c\u00e1i \u6750) called \u201cthe knowing\u201d\n(zh\u012b \u77e5) (A3, A22), roughly akin to the capacity\nor disposition to have conscious states and perform cognitive\nfunctions. (\u201cThe knowing\u201d is thus comparable in different\nrespects to our notions of consciousness and of \u201cthe\nunderstanding.\u201d) \u201cThe knowing\u201d is inactive in\ndreamless sleep (A23), and it is what has desires and aversions (A25).\nIt is the capacity by which we are aware and have knowledge of things,\nand, provided we are awake, it cannot fail to be aware of something.\nThe text compares it to eyesight: sighted people who open their eyes\nalways see something, in the sense of having some visual experience,\neven if what they see is only pitch black darkness or their perception\nis mistaken. The functions the Mohists ascribe to \u201cthe\nknowing\u201d overlap with those other early texts ascribe to the\nheart-mind (x\u012bn \u5fc3), a concept that plays no role\nin later Mohist thought. \n\nOne function of \u201cthe knowing\u201d is deliberation or\nforethought (lv\u0300 \u616e), which is described as a\nprocess of mentally \u201cseeking\u201d something. This may involve\nvisualizing various courses of action and identifying their benefits\nand harms, which can then be \u201cweighed\u201d\n(qu\u00e1n \u6b0a) to reach a decision on how to act. An\ninteresting difference from prominent views in the Western tradition\nis that deliberation is understood as seeking various features by\nwhich to draw a distinction between sh\u00ec \u662f and\nf\u0113i \u975e or benefit and harm. It is not conceived of\nas, for instance, running through the steps of a practical syllogism\nin one\u2019s head. Rather, extending the vision analogy, the texts\nsuggest that whereas \u201cthe knowing\u201d is comparable to\neyesight, deliberation is analogous to peering this way or that while\ntrying to spot something. \n\nAnother function of \u201cthe knowing\u201d is to know or recognize\n(zh\u012b \u77e5) things, which is explained as\n\u201ccontacting\u201d them (A5). Here the analogy is to the\neyesight veridically seeing something. The text explains this sense of\nknowledge as \u201cto know is, by means of \u2018the knowing\u2019,\npassing by something and being able to describe it.\u201d\nInterestingly, knowing is here characterized as the practical ability\n(n\u00e9ng \u80fd) to \u201cdescribe\u201d\n(m\u00e0o \u8c8c) something encountered, probably by\napplying a term to it. It is not regarded as an inner mental state\nthat represents the world accurately, nor as an attitude toward a\nsentence or proposition. Technically, the ability to correctly apply a\nterm to something (such as by saying, \u201cThis is a dog\u201d or\nby pointing at a dog and declaring, \u201cDog!\u201d) can be\nunderstood as an expression of propositional knowledge. But the text\nexplains such knowledge in terms of an ability or know-how. \n\nThis passage seems to characterize knowing (zh\u012b\n\u77e5) quite narrowly, as the ability to recognize something\nencountered in perceptual experience. Elsewhere the Canons\nand Explanations use the word \u2018know\u2019\n(zh\u012b \u77e5) with a broader scope, so that it includes\ncases other than perceptual knowledge, or at least other than\nknowledge of things the knower has personally experienced. One passage\nexplains that though the senses are the source of perceptual\nknowledge, once we know something, we need not rely on the senses in\norder to continue to know it (B46). Our knowledge of\nsomething\u2014that is, our ability to describe it\u2014can remain\neven after we no longer perceive it. We can also come to know\nsomething by having it reported or explained to us without having\nperceived it ourselves (A80, B9). \n\nA third function or capacity of \u201cthe knowing\u201d is\ndiscursive knowledge, here equated with understanding (A6). This form\nof knowledge is explained as \u201cby means of \u2018the\nknowing,\u2019 sorting things [into kinds] in such a way that\none\u2019s knowing [correctly recognizing] them is obvious.\u201d\nWhereas knowing in the sense of recognition is analogous to seeing\nsomething, knowledge or understanding in the sense explained here is\nanalogous to being clear-sighted. The two are closely interrelated,\nthough the text does not make the details of the relationship entirely\n explicit.[12]\n One reasonable interpretation is that zh\u012b, or \u201cto\nknow,\u201d as described in Canon A5 is primarily a verb that refers\nto recognizing or knowing of some particular thing or another, while\nknowledge or understanding as characterized in A6 is a noun referring\nto the underlying, systematic ability to recognize and sort\n(l\u00f9n \u8ad6) or classify various things. Knowledge\n(in the sense of A6) may be the underlying skill or ability that\nenables one to know or recognize things (in the sense of A5) in\nvarious contexts. Knowing (A5) would then be an application of\nknowledge (A6). At the same time, however, knowing (A5) is in effect a\ncomponent of knowledge (A6), since the text says that the latter lies\nin being able to sort things in a way that shows one knows them,\npresumably in the sense of A5. Another passage tells us that\nknowing\u2014again, presumably in the sense of A5\u2014is the means\nby which one sorts things (B34), which is the sign of knowledge in the\nsense of A6. \n\nKnowledge or understanding (A6) seems to be the Mohist analogue to\nwhat we might call discursive or theoretical knowledge, systematic\nknowledge of various things and relations between them. But there are\ninteresting differences between the Mohist conception of such\nknowledge and conceptions prevalent in the Western tradition. The\nMohists regard the structure of such knowledge as a system of\nclassifications\u2014of relations and distinctions among various\nkinds (l\u00e8i \u985e)\u2014and not, for example, as a\ndeductive system. They do not see knowledge as having a sentential or\npropositional structure. Knowing is not a matter of the\nsubject\u2019s standing in a certain relation to a true proposition;\nindeed, their account makes no mention of beliefs, propositions, or\ntruth. Rather, knowledge or understanding is explained as a kind of\nability or know-how: the ability to use \u2018the knowing\u2019 to\n\u201csort\u201d things, which is to distinguish them into kinds and\napply the appropriate names to them. This know-how corresponds\nfunctionally to propositional knowledge, in that it will typically be\nexpressed in statements of the form \u201cA is\nB\u201d\u2014such as \u201coxen are\nanimals\u201d\u2014which by our lights express facts or true\npropositions. But the Mohists\u2019 explanation is that such a\nstatement manifests the skill or ability to \u201csort\u201d or\n\u201cdistinguish\u201d oxen as falling within the kind\nanimal.\n5.2 Sources and Objects of Knowledge\n\nCanon A80 gives a categorization of three sources and four objects of\nknowledge. The sources of knowledge are hearsay, or testimony;\n\u201cexplanation,\u201d or inference; and \u201cin person,\u201d\nor observation. Hearsay or testimony (w\u00e9n \u805e) is\nexplained as \u201creceiving it as passed along.\u201d Elsewhere,\n\u201cpassing along\u201d is glossed as \u201csomeone reports\nit\u201d (A81), and \u201creporting\u201d (g\u00e0o\n\u544a, also \u201cinforming\u201d) is itself explained as\n\u201cmaking someone know\u201d (B9). Explanation\n(shu\u014d \u8aaa) is illustrated by the example\n\u201csquares do not rotate.\u201d Other passages explain it as\n\u201cthat by which one understands\u201d (A72) and as a process of\nciting reasons or causes (NO11). \u201cIn person\u201d or\n\u201cpersonal\u201d (q\u012bn \u89aa) is explained as\n\u201cobserving it there oneself.\u201d This notion is probably the\nclosest the Mohists come to articulating a conception of experience.\nHowever, since they do not, in fact, use any term interpretable as\nexpressing an explicit concept of experience, we should stick closely\nto their terminology and characterize \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d\n(q\u012bn zh\u012b \u89aa\u77e5, B70) as knowledge by\nobservation (gu\u0101n \u89c0). \n\nInterestingly, in discussing \u201cpersonal knowledge,\u201d the\nMohists do not posit any sort of intermediary, such as the British\nEmpiricists\u2019 ideas or impressions, that stands between objects\nand the mind. Rather, we perceive things by means of the sense organs\n(B46), which allow perceived features to enter directly into\n\u201cthe knowing\u201d (A98). \u201cPersonal knowledge\u201d\ncontrasts with \u201cknowledge by explanation\u201d (shu\u014d\nzh\u012b  \u8aaa\u77e5, B70), which is in effect knowledge\nobtained by inference or reasoning. The Mohists probably understand\nexplanation (shu\u014d \u8aaa, also \u201caccount\u201d\nor \u201cdoctrine\u201d) as a process of giving reasons\n(g\u00f9 \u6545) to support or explain some claim (NO11,\nB66). Explanation enables us to obtain knowledge that goes beyond\ndirect personal observation, such as by drawing inferences from\ninformation provided by others. Having been told that an object hidden\nin a room is the same color as a white object before us, we know\n\u201cby explanation,\u201d without observation, that the hidden\nobject is white (B70). In a debate, or bi\u00e0n \u8faf,\nhaving an explanation allows us to assert more than merely that\nsomething does or does not match an agreed-upon model. We can assert,\nfor instance, that a circle is nowhere straight (A98). However,\nknowledge by explanation probably does not reflect a conception of\nreason in itself as a distinct source of knowledge, an idea familiar\nfrom Western rationalism. For the clearest example the Mohists give of\nit is not knowledge of an a priori proposition, but knowledge obtained\nby analogical inference from information provided by an informant\n (B70).[13]\n So \u201cknowledge by explanation\u201d seems a catch-all term for\nknowledge obtained by inference, whether deductive, inductive,\nabductive, or analogical. \n\nIn comparison with the Western tradition, it is notable that the\nMohists privilege neither observation nor explanation\u2014and by\nextension, neither experience nor reason\u2014as a more fundamental\nsource of knowledge. Both are given equal weight. Nor do they\nemphasize a distinction between the type or quality of knowledge\nderived from the two sources, such as that one is more certain than\nthe\n other.[14]\n Moreover, they take observation and explanation to be on a par with a\nthird source of knowledge, \u201chearsay,\u201d or the reports of\nother people. They thus explicitly recognize the social aspects of\nknowledge, a topic that has recently attracted much interest in\ncontemporary epistemology. \n\nThe four objects of knowledge (A80) are names (m\u00edng\n\u540d, words), stuff (sh\u00ed \u5be6, including\nobjects, events, and situations), \u201cmatching\u201d\n(h\u00e9 \u5408), and acting (w\u00e9i\n\u70ba). The first two are explained by their role in language.\nNames are \u201cthat by which we call\u201d (what we use to talk).\nStuff (sh\u00ed) is \u201cwhat we call\u201d (what we\ntalk about). The next two concern the correctness of assertion and\naction. \u201cMatching\u201d is when name and thing fit together\nproperly. \u201cActing\u201d is intentional conduct. \n\nThe first two kinds of knowledge concern acquaintance or\nfamiliarity\u2014what we might call \u201cknowing-of.\u201d\nKnowledge of names probably refers to knowing words, without\nnecessarily knowing how to correctly distinguish what\nsh\u00ed (stuff, objects) they refer to. An example would\nprobably be the\n blind man\n who can use the words \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 in\nstatements such as \u201cBright things are white and dark things are\nblack\u201d but cannot identify black or white objects when presented\nwith them. Presumably the criterion for knowing a name is knowing how\nto use it in at least some contexts.\n\nKnowing stuff probably refers to recognizing objects, events, or\nsituations under some name\u2014at the very least, under the\n\u201call-reaching\u201d or \u201cuniversal\u201d name\n\u2018thing\u2019, which applies to everything\u2014without\nnecessarily knowing the correct name for them. For example, sometimes\nthe same kind of object may have two names, such as \u2018dog\u2019\nand \u2018hound\u2019 (B39). Someone might know of this kind of\nobject and know to call it \u201cdog,\u201d without also knowing to\ncall it \u201chound.\u201d Then the person would know the stuff\nreferred to by \u2018hound\u2019 but not the name\n\u2018hound\u2019. \n\nKnowledge of \u201cmatching\u201d is knowing how to correctly\ndistinguish, or identify, the kind of thing to which a name refers.\nThis is the sort of practical know-how that the blind man lacks. Early\nMohist epistemology seems to have focused on this form of knowledge to\nthe exclusion of the preceding two. The later Mohists also seem to\nhave taken this as their primary focus, since as we saw above they\nexplain both perceptual knowledge and understanding as an ability to\nmatch names with things by describing them (A5) or sorting them into\nkinds (A6). (Clearly, though, a person could learn a good deal about\nsorting into kinds merely on the basis of knowing names.) The fourth\ntype of knowledge, knowledge of acting, is knowing how to act\ncorrectly\u2014probably, given the context, knowing how to respond\nappropriately to the sort of thing denoted by a particular name or\nterm. That this is included in a categorization of the objects of\nzh\u012b (knowledge) underscores the theoretical unity of\nknowledge and action for the Mohists. Cognition and practical wisdom,\nor knowing what to do and when to do it, are both considered aspects\nor forms of zh\u012b (knowledge). \n\nAnother, unfortunately obscure canon identifies four sources of doubt,\nor potential causes of erroneous judgment (B10): accidental\ncircumstances, inconclusive evidence, causal overdetermination, and\ntransience. The first of these seems to refer to error due to atypical\ncircumstances. In a dense fog, for instance, someone might mistake a\nman for an ox. Unseasonable weather might cause a person who has moved\nto a light hut in summer to unexpectedly feel cold. The possibility of\nerror in such difficult or unexpected circumstances can provide a\nreason to doubt a judgment. The second source of doubt is insufficient\nevidence. We have reason to doubt that someone who lifts a load of\nfeathers is strong or that someone who shaves wood along the grain is\nskilled woodworker, because these tasks are too easy to be firm\nevidence of strength or skill. The third source is the presence of\nmultiple causes that could explain something. The cause of a\nfighter\u2019s collapse might have been that he was drinking alcohol\nbefore the match or that he was overcome by the heat of the noonday\nsun. Since we cannot know which factor was decisive, we have grounds\nto doubt any claim that one or the other was. The fourth source refers\nto situations in which the object of knowledge may change, such that\nwhat we know ceases to be the case. An obvious example\u2014the\nMohists do not give one\u2014is knowing the status of the weather. We\nknew it was raining when we ran in from the storm, but after some time\nwe may have grounds to doubt whether it is still raining.\n\nInterestingly, particularly in comparison with the Western tradition,\nthe Mohists do not regard the fallibility of perceptual or cognitive\nprocesses as grounds for doubt. In their view, the sources of doubt\nlie not in the nature of the cognitive subject, but in contingent\nfeatures of particular circumstances\u2014that they are potentially\nconfusing, atypical, causally overdetermined, transient, or simply\nprovide inadequate evidence. With the exception of causal\noverdetermination, in most cases doubt can be resolved by further\ninvestigation. Nor is reality considered inherently unknowable,\nbecause of incessant phenomenal change or because appearances mislead\nus as to how things actually are. Accordingly, ancient Chinese\nskepticism\u2014as expressed in the Zhuangzi, for\nexample\u2014is not concerned with the unreliability of sense\nperception or a gap between appearance and reality, but with the\nproblem of grounding the norms by which we draw distinctions between\nthings. \n\nAn interesting consequence of the Mohists\u2019 account of knowledge\nas grounded in know-how, or practical ability, is that they do not\ntreat justification as a component that must be added to a state\ncorresponding to belief in order to produce knowledge. (Reasons\n(g\u00f9 \u6545) have a role in the later Mohist theory\nof dialectics or argumentation, but not in the canons on knowledge.)\nThe text recognizes a contrast between knowing and \u201ctaking to be\nso\u201d (A24, B10), an attitude corresponding to belief, but this\nattitude is not treated as a constituent of knowledge, to which\nsomething must be added to yield knowledge. Instead, perceptual\nknowledge and discursive knowledge seem to lie primarily in the\nability to recognize and respond to things appropriately, mainly by\nnaming and sorting them correctly. Probably no role is assigned to\njustification because the Mohist conception of knowledge is just a\ntype of reliable capacity. The role of justification in the account of\nknowledge as justified true belief is mainly to exclude accidentally\ntrue beliefs, such as lucky guesses, from counting as knowledge. The\nMohists handle this point by taking only correct naming and sorting\nthat issues from a reliable skill or ability to be knowledge. A\nreliability component is obvious in the case of the discursive\nknowledge characterized in Canon A6, which is a comprehensive,\nsystematic ability to sort things into kinds. But reliability may also\nbe part of the Mohist conception of perceptual knowledge, a\nprerequisite for which is the reliable ability to recognize and name\nthings correctly. The Mohists\u2019 account of knowledge converges in\nplaces with themes in contemporary virtue epistemology, in particular\nwith a position that we might call \u201cability reliabilism.\u201d\nThe relationship between the Mohist view of mind and knowledge and\ncontemporary epistemology is an area that deserves further research.\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 conception of knowledge and understanding as\ngrounded in the ability to name and sort things correctly leads us\nback to the questions we raised in response to their theory of\nlanguage. What determines kind distinctions? What makes it correct to\ndistinguish a particular thing as part of one kind or another? In\npractice, how do we determine to which kinds things belong? These\nquestions must be answered before we can determine whether we actually\nhave knowledge in particular cases. For the later Mohists\u2019\nanswers to these questions, we need to look to their account of the\nnotions of \u201csameness\u201d and \u201cdifference\u201d and\ntheir theory of argumentation. \n6. \u201cSame\u201d and \u201cDifferent\u201d\n\nThe notions of \u201csame\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d\n(t\u00f3ng \u540c) and \u201cdifferent\u201d\n(y\u00ec \u7570) lie at the heart of later Mohist\nthought. As we have seen, they are a core part of the explanation of\nhow words refer to things and how we use language to communicate. They\ndetermine what counts as correct \u201cdescribing,\u201d\n\u201csorting,\u201d and \u201cmatching\u201d of names and things\nand thus what knowledge is. The issues of how to distinguish the\n\u201csame\u201d from \u201cdifferent\u201d kinds of things and\nhow to identify particular individuals as belonging to one kind or\nanother are central issues in Mohist semantics and epistemology, and\nthrough them, in the Mohist theory of argumentation as well. \n\nThe Dialectics explore aspects of \u201csameness\u201d\n(t\u00f3ng \u540c) and \u201cdifference\u201d\n(y\u00ec \u7570) in several places. Fragments collected\nin the \u201cGreater Selection\u201d indicate that the writers were\ndeveloping a detailed classification of types of\n\u201csameness,\u201d and one canon (A88) appears to explore a\ncontrast between relative and absolute sameness or difference. Textual\nproblems make it impractical to discuss these passages here, but one\npair of canons presents a clear, intelligible taxonomy of four types\nof sameness and difference (A86\u201387): \n\nSameness in being identical or coextensive, as when two names\nrefer to the same sh\u00ed \u5be6 (object, event,\nsituation). This sort of sameness contrasts with difference in the\nsense of being two different sh\u00ed.\nSameness in being parts of the same unit (t\u01d0\n\u9ad4), as when things are included within a single whole\n(ji\u0101n \u517c). This contrasts with difference in the\nsense of not being connected or attached. The concept of a\n\u201cwhole\u201d here corresponds roughly to a mereological whole\nor fusion and includes functional wholes, such as the body. It may\ncover sets as well, although the textual evidence suggests that the\nMohists probably assimilated set-member relations to part-whole\n relations.[15]\n\nSameness in being together or united, as when things share the\nsame location. This contrasts with difference in the sense of not\nbeing in the same place. One suggestion is that this sense of\nsameness might refer to the relation between the hard and the white\nfeatures of a hard, white stone (B37), the body and \u201cthe\nknowing\u201d of a living thing (A22), or the length and breadth of\nan object (B4) (Graham 2003: 335). Different aspects or features of a single thing might be\nconsidered \u201cthe same\u201d in this sense. Another plausible hypothesis is that this type of sameness refers to things being grouped together on the basis of location or other extrinsic facts about them, such as how they are used. All the items in my desk drawer or all draft animals could be considered \u201cthe same\u201d in this sense and thereby take the same general \u201cname\u201d (Fraser forthcoming). Such groupings of things contrast with groupings on the basis of intrinsic similarity, the fourth type of \u201csameness.\u201d\nSameness in being \u201cof a kind\u201d (l\u00e8i\n\u985e), explained here as \u201chaving a respect in which they are\nthe same.\u201d This contrasts with difference in being \u201cnot of\na kind,\u201d which is \u201cnot the same in any respect.\u201d\nUnlike the first three types of sameness, being \u201cof a\nkind\u201d entails that things are intrinsically similar\n(ru\u00f2 \u82e5) in some respect other than that defined\nby these notions of \u201csameness.\u201d Being \u201cof a\nkind\u201d explains why things are referred to by the same \u201ckind name,\u201d or general term for things of that kind. As we saw in the section on\n language,\n the names of kinds apply to all the similar things that are members of the\nkind (A78). \n\n\nThis list invites an intriguing observation. The writers take the\ngeneral notion of \u201csameness\u201d (t\u00f3ng\n\u540c) to express (at least) four different types of relations: identity or\ncoextension; part-whole relations; being constituent\nfeatures of something or, alternatively, being grouped together on some extrinsic grounds; and sharing some intrinsic similarity and thereby being\n\u201cof a kind.\u201d These relations correspond roughly to those of identity, part versus\nwhole, constitution, set membership, and kind relations, which in European languages are all typically expressed using the verb to be, or the copula.\nWe can say, for example, that Cicero is Tully, in that he is\nidentical with Tully; that Cicero\u2019s finger is Cicero, in that it is part of the whole that is Cicero; that Cicero is his\nbody, in that he is constituted by his body; that Cicero is a magistrate, in that he was a Roman public official; and that Cicero\nis human, in that he is a member of the kind human.\n\n\nThis parallel between the forms of \u201csameness\u201d\n(t\u00f3ng) the Mohists identify and our use of to\nbe strongly suggests that the concept of \u201csameness\u201d\nplays a theoretical role for classical Chinese thinkers comparable to\nthat of to be or the copula in European languages. It is\nlikely that the Mohists and other early Chinese thinkers implicitly\nunderstood an assertion we would translate into the form\n\u2018A is B\u2019 as claiming that A and\nB are \u201cthe same,\u201d in one of the several senses\nspecified above. Evaluating the truth of such an assertion would be\nunderstood as evaluating whether A and B are indeed\n\u201cthe same\u201d in the relevant way. More generally, early\nChinese theorists probably regarded assertion, judgment, and reasoning\nall as processes of distinguishing whether things are \u201cthe\nsame\u201d or not. Stating a fact about the world would have been\nseen as a matter of identifying a sameness or difference, in one of\nfour (or more) senses of\n \u201csameness.\u201d[16]\n \u201cWhite horses are horses\u201d would be interpreted as in\neffect claiming that white horses and horses are \u201cthe\nsame,\u201d and \u201cOxen are not horses\u201d as claiming that\noxen and horses are \u201cdifferent.\u201d If these interpretive\nhypotheses are correct, then it is no exaggeration to say that\ndistinguishing same and different\u2014in effect, pattern recognition\nor analogical extension\u2014is the core explanatory notion\nunderlying classical Chinese philosophy of language, epistemology, and\nlogic.\n6.1 The Basis for Distinguishing Kinds\n\nThe explanation of sameness in being \u201cof a kind\u201d bears on\nthe questions raised at the end of section 4 about the grounds for recognizing some\nkinds and not others and the explanation of why particular things count as members of one kind or another. The Mohists\u2019 explanation of being\n\u201cof a kind\u201d\u2014\u201chaving a respect in which\nthey\u2019re the same\u201d\u2014might at first glance seem to allow\nthat any group of things with anything in common could be considered a\nkind. Could the collection of items in your desk drawer then\nconstitute a kind by virtue of their similarity in being in the\ndrawer? A view that allows an affirmative answer might make\nidentification of kinds highly arbitrary, leading to an extreme\nrelativist or conventionalist view on which almost any group of things\ncould count as a kind. However, the Mohists would probably reject such\nan extreme view. A collection of things in a drawer might be\n\u201cthe same\u201d in being united, or grouped together, the third of the four types of\nsameness above, but presumably it would not be \u201cthe same\u201d in being\n\u201cof a kind.\u201d Rather, the Mohists seem to hold that to be\nof the same kind, things must possess one or more shared, intrinsically\nsimilar features, such as their visible characteristics (m\u00e0o \u8c8c)\nor shape (x\u00edng \u5f62) (Robins 2012). Nevertheless, since there\nare indefinitely many respects in which things might have similar\nobservable features, the Mohist stance could still be quite liberal,\nallowing things to be divided up into various kind distinctions\ndepending on which features a speech community happens to attend to. \n\nThe Mohists specify three sorts of general criteria for naming things,\nas we mentioned briefly in the section on\n language. (There may originally have been\nfurther criteria, as only a series of fragments remain of the text or\ntexts that treated these issues.) Some general names refer to objects that share the same \u201cshape and looks\u201d (x\u00edng\nm\u00e0o \u5f62\u8c8c, visible form and observable\nfeatures). Examples include mountains, hills, houses,\nshrines, swords, humans, and parts of the body (NO1\u20132, 7).\nSuch names are likely regarded as denoting kinds, since their use is based on features regarded as intrinsically similar. Other general names distinguish things on the basis of \u201cresidence and\nmigration\u201d (j\u016b y\u00f9n \u5c45\u904b). These\ninclude anything named after a place, such as a Qin horse, or anything\nlocated in a place. Instead of picking out things that count as kinds in the sense of sharing some intrinsic similarity, this criterion seems to identify things that are \u201cthe same\u201d by virtue of being \u201cunited\u201d in some way, such as by being in the same location. A third set of criteria are \u201camount and\nnumber\u201d (li\u00e0ng sh\u00f9 \u91cf\u6578)\n(NO2). Perhaps an example of a kind based on such criteria\nmight be \u201cquadruped.\u201d\n\nThese general criteria are hardly enough to resolve all of our\nquestions about the basis for kind distinctions, however. Kinds are\ndiscriminated from other things by citing or\n \u201cpresenting\u201d\n (j\u01d4 \u8209) distinctive features shared by their members. These features must be selected carefully. If we\nchoose features that are not genuinely relevant or comparable, then\nthe distinctions we draw will be specious (B76). If we cite features\nshared by individuals of more than one kind, we will fail to\ndistinguish the kinds correctly and reliably. The Mohists call the use\nof such specious or unreliable criteria \u201cwild\npresenting\u201d (ku\u00e1ng j\u01d4 \u72c2\u8209,\nciting features \u201ccrazily\u201d or \u201carbitrarily\u201d).\nAs canon B66 explains, we cannot recognize the differences between\nkinds of things correctly if we cite features that different kinds\nboth have (as oxen and horses both have teeth and tails) or features\nthat only some but not all of one kind have (as some but not all\ncattle have horns). \n\nThe specific issue framed in B66 is how, assuming that oxen and horses\nare indeed different kinds, we can specify distinguishing features to\ndifferentiate them\n reliably.[17]\n But the Mohists\u2019 rejection of \u201cwild\npresenting\u201d raises a more general issue. What determines the\ndistinctions between kinds, such that citing some features is\n\u201cwild\u201d and others not? Instead of distinguishing oxen\nfrom horses, could we instead group hornless oxen and horses together\nas a kind? The Mohists\u2019 implicit view seems to be\u2014though\nthe textual evidence is sparse and open to competing\ninterpretations\u2014that the difference between kinds such as oxen\nand horses lies in distinctive similarities shared by members of each\nkind that are inherent in their sh\u00ed \u5be6 (stuff),\nobtaining independently of human activity. Hence kind relations are determined by the\nnatural world, not by human attitudes or conventions. Which kind\ndistinctions we attend to and employ may be up to us, but that some\ngroup of things forms a kind is not. In seeking to distinguish kinds,\nthen, our task is to identify features that allow us to recognize the\ninherent differences between them reliably.\n\nThis view seems implied by canon B1, which depicts two parties to a\ndebate discussing how to \u201csettle\u201d (zh\u01d0\n\u6b62) what kind (l\u00e8i \u985e) they are referring\nto by considering in turn whether the presence or absence of various\nfeatures in one or more individual exemplars generalizes to the entire\nkind. The scenario depicted seems to presuppose that the particular\nexemplar (a horse, suppose) is inherently a member of a predetermined\nkind (horses). (This implicit assumption is reflected in the\ntext\u2019s referring to the exemplar as \u201cthis/these\nhere\u201d [c\u01d0 \u6b64] and to the kind it is\nunderstood to belong to as \u201cthis (kind)\u201d\n[sh\u00ec \u662f].) The debaters\u2019 task is not to\nagree on features by which to establish or institute the kind, but to\nfind features that reliably distinguish a collection of inherently\nsimilar things from other, non-similar things. They cannot simply\nstipulate what the features of the kind will be, just as they cannot\nsimply stipulate that oxen are distinguished from horses by having\nhorns. The similarity relation between the exemplar horse and other\nhorses that constitutes being \u201cof a kind\u201d is intrinsic to them and does not depend on our deeming them similar. Hence it seems\nappropriate to characterize the Mohist stance as \u201crealist,\u201d specifically in the sense that the \u201csameness\u201d relations that determine kinds are inherent in things and not a product of human attitudes or practices.\n\n\nThis implicitly realist view of similarity relations and kind\ndistinctions seems operative as well in canon B2, which indicates that\nwe can be mistaken in how we project kind relations, since features of\nindividual exemplars may not generalise to all members of their kind.\nThe canon again seems to assume that the kind relation between an\nexemplar and others of its kind exists independently of our\nidentifying it, and so questions can arise as to whether we are\nextending kinds properly. If kind relations were not independent in\nthis way, the features by which we distinguish and name the exemplar\ncould simply define what features are \u201cso\u201d of the kind.\n\n\nOn this line of interpretation, then, we find the Mohists contending\nin canons B8 and B72 that although we can \u201cborrow\u201d the\nname of one kind and use it of another thing\u2014their examples are\nthat we might name a dog \u201cCrane\u201d or a family might be\nsurnamed \u201cCrane\u201d\u2014it is impermissible to claim things\njust are whatever we call them. The dog is not actually a water bird.\nWhether or not something is the sort of thing designated by a name is\ndetermined not by our happening to deem it so, but by whether it is in fact\nrelevantly similar to other things that take that name. \nGeneral terms must \u201cproceed\u201d (x\u00edng \u884c), or be projectible to, their extensions in regular, predictable ways. Names of kinds must \u201cproceed\u201d on the basis of inherent similarities. \nCanon B72 is\nin effect attacking the stance, associated with the\n \u201cSchool of Names\u201d\n and discussed in certain Zhuangzi passages, that anything\ncan arbitrarily be deemed \u201cso\u201d with respect to some\n kind.[18]\n\n\nThe issues at stake here matter not only for the Mohists. They are\namong the central questions in classical Chinese philosophy, addressed\nin different ways by Mohists, Daoists, Confucians, and others. For\nwhat scheme of kind distinctions we adopt was seen as determining\nvalues, norms of action, and even the organization of society. In the\nWestern tradition, views on similar issues have tended to fall into\none of three general categories: realism, conceptualism, or\n nominalism.[19]\n This taxonomy is unhelpful in understanding classical Chinese\nthought, however, for the various positions in the Chinese discourse\nall tend to fall roughly under the label of nominalism, appealing\nneither to universals nor to concepts to explain the relation between\na thing and its kind. The range of Chinese positions can more usefully\nbe plotted along a spectrum from a form of realism to various forms of\nconventionalism or\n relativism,[20]\n representing the extent to which they treat distinctions between\nkinds as fixed and independent of human activity, on the one hand, or\nas relative to our (potentially plural and variable) attitudes,\npractices, context, or point of view, on the other. On one end of this\nspectrum would be monistic realism, the view that kind distinctions\nare determined by a single, uniquely correct pattern of similarity\nrelations fixed by the world itself, such that exactly one set of kind\ndistinctions are the correct ones. Next might come a weaker form of\nrealism, on which kind distinctions rest on similarity relations fixed\nby the world, but different speech communities might employ kind names\nthat pick out some or other of these distinctions depending on their\ninterests or customs. Further in the relativist direction would be\n Xunzi\u2019s\n pragmatic conventionalism, which holds that the similarity relations\nthat underwrite kind distinctions are not inherent in things\nthemselves but are determined by social conventions based on our\nnatural biological disposition to classify certain things similarly,\nour cultural traditions, political decisions, and practical efficacy\nin securing socioeconomic order. Still further in the relativist\ndirection would be the positions of the \u201cDiscourse on Evening\nThings Out\u201d and \u201cAutumn Waters\u201d essays in the\n Zhuangzi,\n both of which hold that, though the schemes of kind distinctions we\nemploy are grounded in similarities between things, these similarities\nthemselves are determined by our perspective, practices, or context.\nAt the extreme relativist end of the spectrum would be the view that\nkind distinctions are entirely arbitrary, fixed only by the contingent\nwhims of the person doing the classifying. It is unclear whether any\nearly Chinese thinker actually held such a view, though ideas\nassociated with\n Hui Shi\n and\n Gongsun Long\n suggest that they might have. \n\nThe later Mohists most likely fall on the realist side of\nthis spectrum, although their account of the grounds for kind distinctions is so sketchy that any interpretation of their position is partly conjectural. Their stance seems to be that whether we recognize some kind by dubbing its exemplars with a name\u2014as when we dub horses\n\u201chorse\u201d\u2014is determined by our practices, but that whether a group of objects, such as horses, form a kind is determined by whether the objects are intrinsically similar, independently of our practices (A78, A86). \n\n\nThe texts do not clearly indicate whether, for example, the aggregate oxen-and-horses\u2014that\nis, draft animals\u2014could conventionally be deemed a kind (cf. B67).\nPerhaps the Mohists would instead hold that, as draft animals, oxen and horses are \u201cthe same\u201d in being \u201cunited\u201d by their function in pulling carts (that is, by the third of the four types of \u201csameness\u201d). Canon B66 seems to imply that hornless oxen and horses cannot form a kind, probably because no feature distinguishes just this grouping of hornless animals from all others. By contrast, perhaps hornless quadrupeds could constitute a kind, because their inherent similarity in having four legs but lacking horns distinguishes them from all other creatures. In the end, later Mohist texts offer no explicit, detailed explanation of exactly which similarities between things constitute the basis for kinds. On this point, their treatment contrasts with that of, for example, Xunzi, who clearly indicates that the relevant \u201csamenesses\u201d are constituted through social practices. [21]\n\n7. Argumentation and Logic\n\nAs we have seen, Mohist semantics and epistemology are grounded in the\nnotion of distinguishing things as \u201cthe same\u201d\n(t\u00f3ng \u540c) or \u201cdifferent\u201d\n(y\u00ec \u7570). To predicate a general term of\nsomething is to distinguish it as similar to, or of a kind\n(l\u00e8i \u985e) with, other things denoted by that\nterm. Knowledge and understanding are explained in terms of the\nability to distinguish and name things correctly. In this theoretical\nframework, judgment amounts to the act of either grouping things\ntogether as \u201csimilar\u201d or \u201cthe same\u201d or\ndistinguishing them as \u201cdifferent.\u201d An assertion is in\neffect a claim that something is or is not \u201cthe same\u201d or\n\u201cof a kind\u201d with something else. Thus argumentation or\ndisputation\u2014the process of supporting an assertion by citing\nother, established claims\u2014is typically seen as a process of\ndistinguishing whether two things are or are not \u201cthe\nsame\u201d or whether something belongs to a certain kind. \n\nAs might be expected, given this background, the Mohists\u2019\nlogical investigations focus on analogical reasoning, and indeed they\ntend to treat all argumentation as fundamentally analogical in nature.\nThey do not investigate formal logic or deductive inference, nor\nformulate an explicit notion of logical consequence. They do apply\nversions of the laws of excluded middle and non-contradiction, along\nwith concepts of logical \u201cpermissibility\u201d\n(k\u011b \u53ef) and \u201cperversity\u201d\n(b\u00e8i \u6096, \u8a96) that are intertwined with a\nrough notion of logical\n consistency.[22]\n They also employ a rigorous system of quantifiers and conjunctions of\nimplication. Still, none of these logical notions is addressed as an\nexplicit topic of investigation, nor are they organized and presented\nin a systematic way. The Mohists\u2019 discussion focuses on\nsemantics and analogical argumentation.\n\nThe Mohists refer to the field of activity in which we support,\nevaluate, and argue over assertions as bi\u00e0n \u8faf,\na word interpretable as \u201cdialectics,\u201d \u201cdistinction\ndrawing,\u201d \u201cdiscriminating,\u201d or\n\u201cdisputation.\u201d (For convenience, we will translate it as\n\u201cdisputation,\u201d though, as we will see, Chinese thinkers\nunderstand it very literally as a process of\n\u201cdiscriminating,\u201d or drawing distinctions.) Early Chinese\ntexts describe disputation at several levels of\n generality.[23]\n In its broadest sense, disputation is extensive in scope, covering\naspects of semantics, argumentation, logic, and rhetoric. It is\ncomparable to the Greek notion of dialectics, considered loosely as\ndebate or reasoning aimed at knowledge. The Mohists\u2019\n\u201cLesser Selection\u201d (Xi\u01ceo Q\u01d4) depicts it\nas a general process of reasoning and judgment that covers virtually\nall cognitive activity, including topics corresponding to politics,\nsemantics, natural science, and ethics. \n\nDisputation (bi\u00e0n \u8faf), by it we clarify\ndivisions between this (sh\u00ec \u662f) and not-this\n(f\u0113i \u975e) to examine the guidelines of order and\ndisorder; clarify points of sameness and difference to discern the\npatterns of names (m\u00edng \u540d) and stuff\n(sh\u00ed \u5be6); and settle benefit and harm to resolve\nuncertainty and doubt. Only then can we lay out what is so of the\nmyriad things and sort out parallels in groups of statements. (NO6)\n\n\nOther texts portray disputation as a competitive, argumentative\nactivity, a kind of public debate or dispute. The narrowest, most\nspecific descriptions depict it as a process of arguing over whether,\nwith respect to some name or term (m\u00edng), something is\nsh\u00ec (this) or f\u0113i (not-this), part of\nthe extension of the term or not. Any two or more things that are\nsh\u00ec (this) are thereby \u201cthe same\u201d in some\nway. So disputation is in effect a process of distinguishing what is\nor is not \u201cthe same.\u201d At each level of generality, it is\nsaid to involve distinguishing sh\u00ec/f\u0113i\n\u662f\u975e (this/not-this) and t\u00f3ng/y\u00ec\n\u540c\u7570 (same/different). Disputation in the narrow sense of\narguing over whether a term can properly be predicated of a thing is\nprobably the basic component activity of disputation in the wider\nsenses. Disputation in the broadest sense of \u201cdebate\u201d or\n\u201cdialectics\u201d is in effect an extended process of\ndisputation in the narrow\n sense.[24]\n\n\nCanons A73\u201374 give a precise explication of disputation in its\nmost concrete sense. It is contending over which of two complementary\nterms, such as \u2018ox\u2019 and \u2018non-ox\u2019,\n\u201cfits\u201d (d\u00e0ng \u7576) a thing\n(sh\u00ed) (A74). Such pairs of terms divide everything in\nthe world into two mutually exclusive categories: any one thing is\neither ox or non-ox. In disputation, one side calls a thing\n\u201cox,\u201d the other \u201cnon-ox\u201d; the side whose claim\nfits the thing wins. The text cites a version of the law of excluded\nmiddle (A73) to show that at least one of the pair of terms must fit\nand a version of the law of non-contradiction (A74) to show that at\nleast one must fail to\n fit.[25]\n The speech act of calling the thing \u201cox\u201d or\n\u201cnon-ox\u201d has the pragmatic significance of an assertion,\nand so disputation can be understood by our lights as a debate over\nwhich of two contradictory assertions is true. But the Mohists do not\nview it this way. They see it as contending over whether the\nsh\u00ed (stuff, thing) at hand is of the kind ox\nor not. Equivalently, they see it as debating whether, with respect to\nthe term \u2018ox\u2019, the thing at hand is \u201cthis\u201d\n(sh\u00ec) or \u201cnot-this\u201d\n(f\u0113i)\u2014whether the term \u201cfits\u201d it or\nnot. \n\nHow do we determine whether something is \u201cthis\u201d or not? As\nexplained in\n section 4.1,\n we cite a\n model or paradigm (f\u01ce \u6cd5)\n of the kind in question and try to show that the thing is or is not\nrelevantly similar to it. A thing is \u201cso\u201d\n(r\u00e1n \u7136) when its \u201clooks\u201d\n(m\u00e0o \u8c8c, observable features) are similar\n(ru\u00f2 \u82e5) to the model (f\u01ce)\n(A70\u201371). Models may include a thought of the thing, measuring\ntools or other devices for identifying it, or concrete examples.\nThings can \u201cmatch\u201d (h\u00e9 \u5408) the model\n\u201cexactly,\u201d as when a circle is exactly the same shape as\nthe model, or by what is \u201cappropriate,\u201d as when we deem a\nman \u201cswarthy\u201d by the color of his skin, not his hair or\neyes (A83, A96). The overall process of citing a model, explaining the\nreasons for distinguishing something as \u201cthis\u201d or\n\u201cnot-this,\u201d and thus achieving understanding is called\n\u201cexplanation\u201d or \u201cpersuasion\u201d\n(shu\u014d \u8aaa) (A72, NO11). \u201cExplanation\u201d\n(shu\u014d) is the analogue, in the Chinese context, of\ngiving an argument for a claim. However, an \u201cexplanation\u201d\nhas no particular formal structure. Nor is it regarded as proving a\nconclusion; the Mohists develop no conception of deductive proof. It\nis simply the process of explaining the grounds (g\u00f9\n\u6545) for distinguishing something as \u201cthis\u201d or\n\u201cnot-this.\u201d \n\nA series of canons following those just discussed describe detailed\nprocedures for disputation, but textual and interpretive problems\nplace them beyond the scope of this article. Several other\ncanons\u2014equally obscure, but worth summarizing briefly\nhere\u2014identify potential problems in disputation. These have two\nmain sources: the inherently fallible nature of analogical extension\nand the Mohists\u2019 discovery that similar grammatical structure\nneed not reliably reflect similar semantics. \n7.1 \u201cThe Difficulty of Extending Kinds\u201d\n\nIn a typical disputation (bi\u00e0n \u8faf), we compare\nsomething to a model or exemplar of the kind (l\u00e8i\n\u985e) of thing denoted by some term and judge whether or not they\nare \u201cthe same.\u201d In the narrowest sort of case, we might\ndispute whether a particular individual is of a certain kind, such as\noxen. At a higher level of generality, we might dispute\nwhether or not one kind of thing, A, is also of another kind,\nB. For instance, we might dispute whether or not oxen are of\nthe kind four-footed animals. In either sort of case, we are\nconsidering whether to \u201cextend\u201d our judgment about what is\nof a kind to include something new. In classical Chinese thought,\njudging that some new thing falls within a recognized kind is called\n\u201canalogical extension\u201d or \u201cextending kinds\u201d\n(tu\u012b l\u00e8i \u63a8\u985e).\n\nSuch judgments will typically be based on comparison with selected\nfeatures of a limited set of exemplars. We will usually proceed by\nidentifying a few distinguishing features of a handful of\nrepresentatives of the kind, a process the Mohists call\n\u201csettling the kind\u201d (B1). Yet things of the same kind may\nbe dissimilar in some respects, while things of different kinds may\nnevertheless share some similarities. So problems can arise in\nidentifying distinguishing features and differentiating kinds. The\nMohists call this the \u201cdifficulty of extending kinds\u201d\n(B2). The canon that presents the problem is corrupt and obscure, but\nwe can make an educated conjecture as to its gist. It identifies two\nsources of difficulty: first, some features, but not all, are shared\nby every member of a kind; second, because kinds may be larger or\nsmaller in scope, two things may be similar in both falling under one\nkind without being similar in falling under another. All quadrupeds\nare alike in having four feet, but not all are alike in being oxen,\nhorses, or deer. Birds and all other animals are alike in being living\ncreatures, but not all animals are birds. One cannot invariably\ngeneralize from features of an exemplar to claims about an entire\nkind, because\u2014with the exception of special cases such as being\nfour-footed\u2014it is not obvious from the exemplar which features\nare shared by all members of the kind. Thus in disputation the process\nof identifying features of individual exemplars that are indeed\nrepresentative of their kind will always be fallible. \n\nOther problems concerned the semantics of compound terms, or phrases.\nThe simplest early Chinese model of language\u2014probably the\ndefault starting point for the Mohists\u2019 and other ancient\nChinese thinkers\u2019 reflections\u2014is what we might call the\none-name-one-thing model (cf. Hansen 1983). On this view, names or\nwords (m\u00edng \u540d) are taken to stand in a\none-to-one correspondence with kinds of sh\u00ed \u5be6\n(stuff, things, events, situations). When the Mohists moved on to\nconsider phrases or expressions (c\u00ed \u8fad) formed\nby combining two or more words, they discovered that the\nlanguage-world relation is more complex than this naive model\nsuggests. Linguistic structure does not always directly reflect the\nstructure of things in the world. When two names are strung together,\nthe reference of the resulting phrase may change in unpredictable\nways. Combining \u2018oxen\u2019 and \u2018horses\u2019 gives\n\u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019 (ni\u00fa m\u01ce\n\u725b\u99ac), a phrase denoting the sum of all oxen and horses\n(B12). But combining \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 does\nnot produce a phrase denoting the sum of all hard things and white\nthings. It forms one denoting things that are both hard and white in\nthe same place at the same time (A66, B37). Everything hard-and-white\n(ji\u0101n b\u00e1i \u5805\u767d) is white. But not\neverything falling within the extension of\n\u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019 is oxen. In fact, a dispute over whether\noxen-and-horses are oxen or not is undecidable, since if we claim that\nthey are, on the grounds that part of the sum is oxen, our opponent\ncan claim in response that they are not, on exactly parallel grounds\n(B67) (Fraser 2007b). \u2018White horse\u2019 and \u2018blind\nhorse\u2019 have the same grammatical structure. But whereas a white\nhorse is white all over, a blind horse is not \u201cblind all\nover\u201d; only its eyes are blind (B3). Deeming someone\n\u201cf\u016b \u592b\u201d (husband) but combining the\nword with \u2018y\u00f3ng \u52c7\u2019 (brave) to form\nthe phrase \u2018y\u00f3ng f\u016b \u52c7\u592b\u2019\n(\u201cbrave man\u201d) is not deeming him a husband. But deeming a\npair of things \u201cshoes\u201d while combining the word with\n\u2018buying clothes\u2019 (\u201cbuying clothes and shoes\u201d)\nis still deeming them shoes (B3). \n\nObservations about such formally similar but semantically dissimilar\nphrases led the Mohists to doubt that complex linguistic structures\nhave any regular or reliable relation to the patterns of similarity\nand difference that ground their correct use. Formal parallels between\nthe words and phrases we use to talk about things can guide us in\ndiscriminating kinds only up to a point, because linguistic\nsimilarities may not reflect actual similarities in things. In\nclassical Chinese, \u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019 (ni\u00fa\nm\u01ce \u725b\u99ac) and \u2018white horse\u2019\n(b\u00e1i m\u01ce \u767d\u99ac) have a similar formal\nstructure, but the first denotes the sum of two kinds of things, the\nsecond a portion of one kind of thing. Formal similarities in\nlinguistic structure are thus an unreliable guide to distinguishing\nkinds. To discriminate kinds properly, we need to examine the semantic\ncriteria (y\u012bn \u56e0) or grounds (g\u00f9\n\u6545) that determine the proper use of the words or phrases that\ndenote them, and not rely only on structural similarities to other\nwords or phrases. In some cases, we may need to point out that\nstructurally similar expressions in fact have very different\nsemantics. This is a key theme of the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d\n(Xi\u01ceo Q\u01d4), a brief summary and illustration of\nMohist dialectics that is probably the most important text in the\nhistory of Chinese logic. \n7.2 Methods of Argumentation in the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d\n\nWe quoted the opening paragraph of the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d\n above:[26]\n The text depicts disputation as the general method of achieving\nunderstanding in virtually all areas of inquiry. Specifically, it is\nthe means by which we can determine \u201cwhat is so\u201d of\nthings\u2014what terms are predicable of them, and thus what claims\nare correct\u2014and \u201csort out parallels\u201d between various\ntypes of statements, thus determining what relations between\nstatements might provide good grounds for accepting one statement on\nthe basis of another. The text continues by introducing basic concepts\nand principles of disputation: \n\nBy names (m\u00edng \u540d), present stuff\n(sh\u00ed \u5be6); by expressions (c\u00ed\n\u8fad), put across thoughts (y\u00ec \u610f); by\nexplanations (shu\u014d \u8aaa), bring out reasons\n(g\u00f9 \u6545). Accept and propose on the basis of\nkinds (l\u00e8i \u985e). Having it in our case, we do not\nreject it in the other\u2019s; lacking it in our case, we do not\ndemand it in the other\u2019s.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of comparative philosophy, this statement is of\nfar-reaching significance. Here, in an explicit, systematic\npresentation of their theory of dialectics, the most logically\ninclined thinkers in the Chinese tradition tell us directly that\nassertions are put forth and accepted or rejected on the basis of\nanalogical extension, by deeming things to be of the same kind or not.\nThey add a principle of fairness, stipulating that the same grounds or\ndemands be applied whether evaluating our own claims or the\nopponent\u2019s. They thus indicate that their dialectics is\nprimarily not the study of deductive logic, or formally valid\ninference. It is the study of fair or unbiased analogical persuasion.\nInterestingly, this is an instance of the explicit study of logic in a\nculture reflecting prevailing patterns of reasoning across other\nfields. Early Chinese mathematics and science are likewise based on\nanalogical reasoning and taxonomy, rather than on the model of the\ndeductive system that dominates ancient Greek thought. \n\nThe passage is also significant for what it tells us about the\ncomponents and structure of disputation. Three sorts of linguistic\nunits are mentioned, all of them explained in terms of function, not\nstructure. \u201cNames,\u201d or words, are used to\n\u201cpresent\u201d or talk about things. \u201cExpressions\u201d\nare used to express thoughts and thus to make assertions.\n\u201cExpressions\u201d overlap functionally with what we would\nidentify as sentences. However, a sentence is a grammatical unit,\ncomposed of a subject and a predicate. The Mohists do not characterize\nexpressions as grammatical units, nor as comprising a subject and\npredicate. They see them simply as strings of names that enable us to\nexpress thoughts. Since in classical Chinese a predicate term standing\nalone can express a thought, presumably such a term can also be an\n\u201cexpression.\u201d \u201cExplanations\u201d are used to\nelucidate the reasons for drawing distinctions one way or another.\nFunctionally, an \u201cexplanation\u201d is roughly analogous to an\nargument, or, more precisely, to the premises of an argument, in that\nit serves to support an assertion by giving reasons. However, an\nexplanation is not described as having any particular structure, nor\nany particular logical relation to an assertion other than giving\nreasons for it. \n\nThe text next introduces several further notions, including that of\n\u201cemulation,\u201d or the use of models to distinguish\nsh\u00ec/f\u0113i, before explaining four standard\nrhetorical techniques used in disputation. The four techniques and the\ntext\u2019s explanation of them are as\n follows:[27]\n\n\n\nAnalogy (p\u00ec \u8b6c): \u201cPresenting other\nthings and using them to clarify it.\u201d \n\u201cParalleling\u201d (m\u00f3u \u4f94):\n\u201cPlacing expressions side by side and jointly proceeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cPulling\u201d (yu\u00e1n \u63f4):\n\u201cSaying, \u2018You are so, how is it that I alone cannot be\nso?\u2019\u201d \n\u201cPushing\u201d (tu\u012b \u63a8): \u201cOn the\ngrounds that what they don\u2019t accept is the same as what they do\naccept, propose it.\u201d \n\n\n\nScholars have debated the relationship between these four techniques,\nsome suggesting that they are a sequence of steps employed in the\nprocess of establishing a claim, others that they are inference\nprocedures. It is unlikely they form a fixed sequence of steps, since\nrhetorically in many cases giving an analogy might make presenting\nparallel claims unnecessary, or \u201cpulling\u201d (appealing to\nthe opponent\u2019s precedent) alone might be sufficient to establish\none\u2019s point. Probably there is no fixed relation between the\nfour, and disputers may apply one or more of them as needed to make\ntheir case. Frequently, using just one may be sufficient. \n\nA key point to note about the four techniques, relating back to the\nprinciple that we \u201caccept and propose on the basis of\nkinds,\u201d is that all are specifically procedures for analogical\nargumentation, aimed at distinguishing similarities and differences\nbetween kinds of things and assertions about them. This point is\nunderscored by the next line of the text, which describes the two\nstandard responses to the four rhetorical moves: \u201c\u2018This is\nlike what\u2019s been said\u2019 is \u2018the same.\u2019\n\u2018How can I call it that?\u2019 is\n\u2018different.\u2019\u201d However, the four techniques apply\nanalogical judgment and reasoning in different ways. A concise way of\ncapturing the differences between them is that analogy is grounded in\nsimilarities between things, \u201cparalleling\u201d in similarities\nin phrasing, and \u201cpulling\u201d and \u201cpushing\u201d in\nsimilarities between the discursive commitments of the two\nopponents\u2014between claims one side has previously accepted and\nanalogous claims the other side now seeks to\n establish.[28]\n\nA further point is that these techniques\u2014along with the general\nMohist practice of citing models or exemplars to support one\u2019s\nclaims\u2014are not the proprietary methods of the Mohist school. As\nany reader of the ancient literature will notice, three of them, at\nleast, are standard rhetorical moves employed by classical Chinese\nthinkers and debaters of all stripes. (\u201cParalleling\u201d seems\nto be used less frequently, but examples can be found nonetheless.)\nThe Mozi contains numerous arguments matching these\ndescriptions. But so too do the scores of essays and anecdotes\ncollected in The Annals of L\u00fc Buwei (L\u00fcshi\nChunqiu), for instance.\n Mencius,\n not a thinker one normally associates with the study of logic, is\ndepicted as using them regularly (though not always correctly or\nintelligibly; see Mencius 6A:3). The four moves are thus\nprobably representative of the art of disputation as generally\npracticed in the 3rd century B.C.E. \n\nAnalogy (p\u00ec \u8b6c) is the easiest of the four to\nexplain. It refers to drawing an analogy between one case and another,\nmore familiar or easily understood one, in order to clarify the case\nat hand and presumably to establish a claim about it. It is based on\nan analogical inference from a similarity between selected features of\nthe analogue and features of the case at hand to some further\nsimilarity between the two. Analogies are used regularly in\nargumentation throughout the Mozi and in the \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d as well. \n\nTwo of the techniques, \u201cpulling\u201d and\n\u201cpushing,\u201d are technically forms of argument ad\nhominem, in that the immediate basis for an assertion is the\nopponent\u2019s commitment to a similar assertion concerning what we\ntake to be a similar case. Rhetorically, these two moves attempt to\nsupport a claim not directly by appeal to features of the thing we are\ntalking about, nor its similarity to something else, as in analogy,\nbut by appeal to a claim the opponent has already accepted.\n\u201cPulling\u201d refers to citing the opponent\u2019s precedent\nin accepting an assertion about something and challenging the opponent\nto explain how the precedent is distinct from the case at hand. It is\ntypically signaled by a rhetorical question asking how the present\ncase is any different from the precedent. If no explanation is\nforthcoming, a similar assertion about the case at hand stands.\n\u201cPulling\u201d thus amounts to shifting the burden of argument\nto the other side and inviting them to try to block an implicit\nanalogical inference from the precedent to the case at hand by showing\nhow the two are actually dissimilar. \u201cPushing\u201d refers to\nproposing a claim about something on the basis of similarity to\nanother claim the opponent has already accepted. In early Chinese\nthought, the term for \u201cpushing,\u201d tu\u012b\n\u63a8, is typically used to refer to analogical extension, and\n\u201cpushing\u201d indeed involves an extension from one claim to a\nnew one on grounds that the cases are similar. \n\nSince \u201cpulling\u201d and \u201cpushing\u201d are primarily\nad hominem techniques used in face-to-face debate, not in\nargumentative writing, they appear in early Chinese texts mainly in\ncontexts depicting speakers engaged in debate (bi\u00e0n\n\u8faf) or attempting to persuade each other of something. The\n\u201cLesser Selection\u201d itself contains two examples of\n\u201cpushing,\u201d one of which is presented in\n section 7.3.\n Clear-cut examples of \u201cpulling\u201d in the Mozi are\ndifficult to find. What we generally see instead are instances in\nwhich Mozi challenges the audience to explain how a case under\ndiscussion is any different from a simpler, analogous case. For\ninstance, in the third \u201cHeaven\u2019s Intention\u201d essay,\nMozi cites the case of people who \u201cdo not know the difference\nbetween black and white,\u201d for on seeing a small amount of black,\nthey say it is \u201cblack,\u201d while on seeing a large amount,\nthey say it is \u201cwhite.\u201d He compares this to the case of\nwarlike rulers who forbid murder\u2014the killing of a single\nperson\u2014yet deem it right for their soldiers to kill as many\npeople of a neighboring state as possible. Of this way of\ndistinguishing right from wrong, he asks, \u201cHow is this any\ndifferent from confusing the difference between white and\n black?\u201d[29]\n\n\nA more unambiguous example of \u201cpulling\u201d comes from the\nfamous dialogue between Mencius and King Xuan in section 1A7 of the\nMencius. Mencius argues that the king has the ability to be a\ngenuine king\u2014and not merely a king in name only\u2014because of\nthe compassion he displayed in sparing a frightened ox from\nsacrificial slaughter. He offers two examples of people who claim to\nbe able to perform a difficult feat but not an easy, related task: a\nperson who claims to be able to lift a heavy weight but not a feather\nand one who claims to be able to see the tip of an autumn hair but not\na cartload of firewood. The king agrees that such claims would be\nunacceptable. Mencius then points out that the king\u2019s\nbenevolence is sufficient to reach animals\u2014a\n\u201cdifficult\u201d feat, he thinks, insofar as feeling compassion\nfor an ox comes less naturally to us than feeling it for other\nhumans\u2014yet the benefits of this benevolence do not reach his\npeople\u2014an \u201ceasy\u201d task, since being moved to help\nother people should be easier for us than being moved to help animals.\nHe then asks how the king\u2019s case is any different from the\npreceding examples. The implicit conclusion is that the claim that the\nKing is unable to benefit his people is as unacceptable as a strong\nman saying he cannot lift a feather. Thus the king\u2019s failure is\nnot due to a lack of ability. \n\nThe remaining technique, \u201cparalleling\u201d\n(m\u00f3u \u4f94), or presenting parallel, syntactically\nanalogous utterances, is the most intriguing of the four and the most\ndifficult and controversial to interpret. A variety of accounts have\nbeen\n proposed.[30]\n The interpretive difficulty is due partly to the unfamiliarity of the\ntechnique, which has no obvious counterpart in other logical\ntraditions, partly to the absence of any clearly specified examples in\nthe text, and partly to the terminology the Mohists use to explain it.\nTo paraphrase the text, \u201cparalleling\u201d is lining up\nexpressions side-by-side and jointly proceeding with them all\n(b\u01d0 c\u00ed \u00e9r j\u00f9 x\u00edng\n\u6bd4\u8fad\u800c\u4ff1\u884c). This description is\nextremely general, telling us little more than that paralleling\ninvolves some form of linguistic comparison in which strings of\nutterances are extended or developed in some parallel or analogous\nway. What exactly is referred to by \u201cexpressions\u201d\n(c\u00ed \u8fad) is vague, since, as we saw above, the\nonly explanation the Mohists give is functional, that\n\u201cexpressions\u201d are used to express thoughts.\n\u201cExpressions\u201d could conceivably refer to anything from a\nphrase to a sentence to several sentences. \u201cProceeding\u201d\n(x\u00edng \u884c) is also ambiguous.\n\u201cProceed\u201d is used in relation to semantics in two other\nplaces in the Dialectics, Canons B1 and B72. In both, it\nseems to refer to \u201cproceeding\u201d to using a general term\nconsistently of similar kinds of things. So \u201cproceeding\u201d\nin the present context could refer to going on to make consistent,\nunproblematic utterances. But perhaps it might refer to drawing\ninferences or simply to uttering strings of interrelated\n\u201cexpressions.\u201d Even the conjunction \u201cand\u201d\n(er \u800c) here is open to different interpretations, as\nit could refer to a two-step process of first comparing expressions\nand then jointly proceeding with them or, more likely, to a single\nstep of jointly proceeding with them in parallel. \n\nLet me tentatively suggest that the following, relatively simple\ninterpretation may have the greatest explanatory\n value:[31]\n \u201cparalleling\u201d (m\u00f3u \u4f94) refers very\ngenerally to presenting a series of syntactically parallel utterances,\none or more of which are used to argue by analogy that one or more\nothers should be accepted. The formal similarity between the structure\nor phrasing of the utterances is supposed to lead us to also see an\nanalogical relation between the things or situations described, such\nthat if we accept some of the parallels, we should accept them all.\nThe following is one example of paralleling: \n\nWhite horses are horses; riding white horses is riding horses.\n\nBlack horses are horses; riding black horses is riding horses.\n\n\nOn the proposed interpretation, the first utterance above could be\ntaken as grounds for asserting the second. Alternatively, both\nutterances together could be taken as grounds for asserting a further\nparallel utterance: \n\nBrown horses are horses; riding brown horses is riding horses.\n\n\n\nAs the Mohists understand paralleling, these examples could also\nsupport utterances unrelated to riding horses, such as the following:\n\n\nYellow dogs are dogs; feeding yellow dogs is feeding dogs.\n\nOxen are animals; feeding oxen is feeding animals.\n\n\n\nThe point of paralleling is to employ similarity in syntax or phrasing\nto persuade us to accept new, parallel utterances. The formal\nparallelism is intended to guide us to recognize that the cases in the\nutterances about brown horses, yellow dogs, and oxen are analogous to\nthose in the ones about white and black horses.\n\nThe form of the above examples is \u201cx is y,\nFx is Fy,\u201d where \u201cF\u201d is a\npredicate applied to both x and y. Paralleling is\nnot limited to utterances of this form,\n however.[32]\n On the basis of the Mohists\u2019 discussion in the \u201cLesser\nSelection,\u201d paralleling can be used with a variety of structural\npatterns, including the following, for\n example:[33]\n\n\n\nReading books isn\u2019t books; liking reading books is liking books.\n\nCockfights aren\u2019t gamecocks; liking cockfighting is liking\ngamecocks.\n\nBeing about to fall into a well isn\u2019t falling into a well;\nstopping someone about to fall into a well is stopping someone from\nfalling into a well.\n\nBeing about to go out the door isn\u2019t going out the door;\nstopping someone about to go out the door is stopping someone from\ngoing out the door.\n\n\nBy analogy to this list of parallel utterances, the Mohists contend we\nshould also accept the following:\n\n\nBeing about to die young isn\u2019t dying young; stopping someone\nfrom being about to die young is stopping someone from dying young.\n\nHolding there is fate isn\u2019t fate; rejecting holding there is\nfate is rejecting fate.\n\n\nThe litany of parallel examples is intended to prime us to accept the\nnew, parallel utterances and to see them as identifying further cases\nin which, although x is not y, Fx is\nFy. \n\nThe latter half of the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d presents a\ntaxonomy of cases in which the Mohists contend that syntactic\nparallels between utterances can indeed help justify similar, parallel\nutterances, along with examples of cases in which they cannot. One of\nthe text\u2019s central claims is that parallelism\u2014and indeed\nall four of the rhetorical techniques introduced\u2014is potentially\nmisleading and can be used only with meticulous attention to the\nsemantic grounds underlying the correct use of names and expressions.\nThis claim underscores the nature of the logical inquiries in the\n\u201cLesser Selection.\u201d The text is not exploring formally\nvalid, truth-functional inference procedures, but examining ways in\nwhich analogical inferences\u2014in particular those based on\nsyntactic parallelism\u2014do or do not yield what the writers\nconsider semantically correct utterances. When they do not, the\nMohists reject the results by appeal to what they take to be basic\nnorms governing the semantics of names and expressions, which they see\nas more fundamental than syntactical or formal features. As this\ncharacterization suggests, although their observations about the\nmisleading nature of syntactic parallels may have helped point them\naway from any significant study of formal, truth-functional logic,\ntheir inquiries were oriented in a different direction from the start.\n\n7.3 Limitations of the Methods\n\nDespite the Mohists\u2019 general optimism about the power of\ndisputation (bi\u00e0n \u8faf) to resolve scientific,\nethical, and political problems, an important aim of the \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d is to warn against blindly relying on its formal\nmethods. Unlike a valid deductive argument, analogical\ndistinction-drawing is not invariably reliable. According to the\nMohists\u2019 characterization of the four techniques, a typical\npiece of disputation might involve giving an analogy to support an\nassertion; presenting pairs or series of syntactically parallel\nstatements and contending that since we accept some, we should accept\nothers; appealing to an opponent\u2019s precedent and challenging the\nopponent to explain how the case at hand is different; or asserting a\nstatement on grounds we take to be similar to those for one our\nopponent has already accepted. The Mohists see four sorts of problems\nthat may arise in drawing distinctions and thus making assertions on\nthese grounds, one for each of the four procedures. (1) Analogies are\nnot always reliable, because things similar in some respects may be\nimportantly different in others. (2) Formal parallels hold only up to\na point. (3) The grounds by which an opponent\u2019s precedent and\nour own assertion are \u201cso\u201d (correct) or not may be quite\ndifferent. (4) Likewise, an opponent\u2019s reasons for accepting\nsome assertion may be different from ours. The \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d explains: \n\nThings have respects in which they are similar, yet it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that they are completely similar. Parallels between expressions\nare correct only up to a point. When things are \u201cso,\u201d\nthere is that by which they are \u201cso.\u201d Their being\n\u201cso\u201d is the same, but that by which they are\n\u201cso\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily the same. When people accept\nthings, there is that by which they accept them. Their accepting them\nis the same, but that by which they accept them isn\u2019t\nnecessarily the same. Hence expressions in analogies, paralleling,\n\u201cpulling,\u201d and \u201cpushing\u201d become different as\nthey proceed, become dangerous as they change direction, fail when\ntaken too far, and leave their roots as they flow, and so one cannot\nfail to be cautious and cannot invariably use them. Thus statements\nhave many methods, separate kinds have different reasons, and so one\ncannot look at only one side.\n\n\nWhether something is \u201cso\u201d (r\u00e1n\n\u7136)\u2014that is, whether some term is correctly predicable of\nit\u2014depends on \u201cthat which makes it so,\u201d in effect\nthe satisfaction conditions for the term. Things may be similar in\nsome respects without fulfilling the satisfaction conditions for the\nsame term. Linguistic expressions may be similar in structure while\nhaving dissimilar satisfaction conditions. Hence we must be cautious\nin using the techniques of disputation. Any guidance provided by\nsimilarities between things or parallels between expressions must\nalways be checked against our know-how concerning the\n\u201creasons\u201d (g\u00f9 \u6545, the grounds or\ncriteria) for using various expressions.\n\nThe Mohists appear to have been particularly concerned about\npotentially misleading formal parallels. We can illustrate their\nworries by considering a series of examples that contrast parallels\nthey accept with others they reject. Recall that they affirm the\nparallel utterances \u201cwhite horses are horses, riding white\nhorses is riding horses\u201d and \u201cblack horses are horses,\nriding black horses is riding horses.\u201d As they see it, this sort\nof parallel could provide analogical grounds for also affirming\n\u201cJane is a person, caring about Jane is caring about\npeople\u201d and presumably also \u201cneighbors are people, helping\nneighbors is helping people.\u201d This category of cases the Mohists\ncall \u201cthis and so,\u201d (sh\u00ec \u00e9r\nr\u00e1n \u662f\u800c\u7136) because the first part of\nthe utterance correctly states that something is \u201cthis\u201d\n(sh\u00ec \u662f) with respect to some kind name (as\nwhite or black horses are \u201cthis\u201d with respect to\n\u2018horse\u2019), while the second part correctly states that some\naction is \u201cso\u201d (r\u00e1n \u7136) with respect\nto some predicate (as riding white or black horses satisfies the\npredicate \u2018riding horses\u2019). Cases of the \u201cthis and\nso\u201d kind (l\u00e8i \u985e) can be offered as\nanalogical parallels to support other \u201cthis and so\u201d\nutterances on the grounds that they present the same kind of case.\n\n\nNow consider the utterance \u201ccarts are wood, riding carts is\nriding wood.\u201d Structurally, this is parallel to the examples\nabout horses. Yet the Mohists reject this utterance, presumably\nbecause they think the predicate \u201criding wood\u201d is a\nnonsense phrase that is never \u201cso,\u201d since nothing\nsatisfies it. The correct utterance to make in this case is\n\u201ccarts are wood, riding carts is not riding\nwood.\u201d Rather than \u201cthis and so,\u201d then, the cart\nexample is of the kind \u201cthis but not so\u201d (sh\u00ec\n\u00e9r b\u00f9 r\u00e1n \u662f\u800c\u4e0d\u7136).\nAs with \u201cthis and so,\u201d parallels between \u201cthis but\nnot so\u201d utterances can be drawn to support further \u201cthis\nbut not so\u201d utterances. For example, \u201ccarts are wood,\nriding carts isn\u2019t riding wood\u201d might be cited as a\nparallel to support \u201cboats are wood, getting in boats\nisn\u2019t getting in wood\u201d and \u201chouses are brick, living\nin houses isn\u2019t living in brick.\u201d Since paralleling\nreliably guides utterances only when used in cases of the same kind,\nhowever, dialecticians must carefully distinguish between cases\nproperly treated as \u201cthis and so\u201d and those properly\ntreated as \u201cthis but not so.\u201d Otherwise, they may draw\nfaulty parallels, such as thinking that, since helping neighbors is\nhelping people, living in houses is living in brick. \n\nThe underlying aim of the second half of the \u201cLesser\nSelection\u201d is to clear up such confusion and by so doing lay the\ngroundwork for defending Mohist positions. (Two positions mentioned\nspecifically are those on capital punishment for bandits and on the\nrejection of\n fatalism.)\n Toward this end, the text identifies five kinds of cases in which\n\u201cexpressions\u201d (c\u00ed \u8fad) are used\ndifferently. The first two are \u201cthis and so\u201d and\n\u201cthis but not so\u201d; the others are \u201cnot this but\nso,\u201d \u201cone universal and one not,\u201d and \u201cone\nthis and one not this.\u201d An effective way to illustrate the\nMohists\u2019 approach here is to consider their defense of capital\npunishment, which turns on the distinction between the first two kinds\nof cases. Mohist communities prohibited murder, punishing it by\n death.[34]\n They also apparently advocated capital punishment for, or at least\nlethal self-defense against, the roving gangs of robbers who\nterrorized small communities and traveling merchants. The\n\u201cLesser Selection\u201d implies that they were accused of\ninconsistency for these positions. Robbers are people, so killing\nrobbers is killing people. If killing people is wrong, isn\u2019t\nkilling robbers wrong? Moreover, Mohist ethics advocates caring\ninclusively about all people. Since robbers are people, caring about\nrobbers is caring about people. Killing them seems inconsistent with\ncaring about them. \n\nIn response, the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d contends that the\ncritics are mistaken to claim that killing robbers is killing people\nand caring about robbers is caring about people. In the Mohists\u2019\nview, these are in fact cases of the kind \u201cthis but not\nso\u201d: robbers are people, but killing robbers is not\nkilling people, and caring about robbers is not caring about\npeople. The \u201cLesser Selection\u201d employs paralleling\n(m\u00f3u \u4f94) to give the following explanation of\nthe Mohist stance: \n\n\nJill\u2019s parents are people; [but] Jill\u2019s serving her\nparents isn\u2019t serving people [it is not being employed as a\nservant].\n\nHer brother is a handsome man; [but] caring about her brother\nisn\u2019t caring about a handsome man [it is not sexual attraction].\n\nCarts are wood; [but] riding carts isn\u2019t riding wood.\n\nBoats are wood; [but] getting in boats isn\u2019t getting in wood.\n\nRobber-people are people; [but] there being many robbers isn\u2019t\nthere being many people;\n\nthere being no robbers isn\u2019t there being no people. \n\nHow do we clarify it?\n\nDetesting there being many robbers isn\u2019t detesting there being\nmany people;\n\ndesiring there be no robbers isn\u2019t desiring there be no people.\n\n\nAll the world accompany each other in together deeming these right\n(sh\u00ec \u662f). If it is like this, then although\nrobber-people are people,\n\ncaring about robbers isn\u2019t caring about people [it is not\npracticing inclusive care];\n\nnot caring about robbers isn\u2019t not caring about people [it is\nnot failing to practice inclusive care];\n\nkilling robber-people isn\u2019t killing people.\n\nThere\u2019s no difficulty in this. These cases and those previous\nones [the preceding, purportedly uncontroversial examples] are the\nsame kind. The world accepts those without condemning themselves; the\nMohists accept these but the world condemns them.\u2026These are\ncases of \u201cthis but not so.\u201d\n\n\nOn the grounds of parallelism with (supposedly) uncontroversial\nutterances that \u201call the world\u201d purportedly agree are\nright, we are expected to affirm that killing robbers is not killing\npeople and that not caring about robbers\u2014being unconcerned for\ntheir benefit\u2014is not failing to care about people. Since we\nacknowledge other, parallel \u201cthis but not so\u201d cases, the\ntext asserts, we should accept these as well. Just as lacking robbers\nisn\u2019t lacking people, working on behalf of one\u2019s parents\nisn\u2019t working as a servant, and riding carts isn\u2019t riding\nwood, executing robbers isn\u2019t murdering people and not caring\nabout them isn\u2019t failing to practice inclusive care. \n\nIn contemporary terms, of course, we could reconstruct the passage as\noffering a somewhat bizarre analogical argument for the conclusion\nthat \u201ckilling robber-people isn\u2019t killing people.\u201d\nThe Mohists themselves do not understand it that way, however. They do\nnot see the passage as presenting a series of premises for the\none-sentence conclusion \u201ckilling robber-people isn\u2019t\nkilling people.\u201d They see it as laying out a series of\nsyntactically parallel utterances to illustrate that utterances like\n\u201crobber-people are people, [but] killing robber-people\nisn\u2019t killing people\u201d and \u201crobber-people are people,\n[but] caring about robbers isn\u2019t caring about people\u201d fit\ninto an accepted pattern of statements describing a familiar kind of\nsituation in which, although x is y, Fx is\nnot deemed an act of the kind Fy. \n\nThe text gives no further, substantive explanation of this stance. The\nMohists simply declare that the robbers case is \u201cthis but not\nso,\u201d rather than \u201cthis and so,\u201d and thus despite the\nobvious formal similarity between \u201criding black horses is riding\nhorses\u201d and \u201ckilling robber-people is killing\npeople,\u201d drawing parallels (m\u00f3u \u4f94)\nbetween them is misleading. Previously, of course, the text explained\nthat expressions of different kinds rest on different grounds\n(g\u00f9 \u6545, reasons). On the Mohists\u2019 behalf,\nthen, we can conjecture that the grounds (g\u00f9) that\njustify applying the predicate \u2018killing robbers\u2019 diverge\nfrom those for \u2018killing people\u2019, such that when\n\u2018killing robbers\u2019 is \u201cso,\u201d \u2018killing\npeople\u2019 is \u201cnot so.\u201d Killing people is murder, the\nunjustified killing of innocents; killing robbers is the morally\njustified, legally sanctioned execution of guilty criminals. Similar\nconsiderations would apply to the predicates \u2018caring about\npeople\u2019 and \u2018caring about robbers\u2019. For example, to\nthe Mohists, caring about people entails concern for all\npeople\u2019s benefit; perhaps they hold that since robbers harm\nothers, caring about them is incompatible with concern for all\npeople\u2019s benefit.\n\nStill, what makes killing robbers a case of \u201cthis but not\nso\u201d rather than \u201cthis and so\u201d? Indeed, what is the\nbasis for the entire fivefold taxonomy of cases? The Mohists answer\nneither question\n explicitly.[35]\n Nor do they offer a principled or systematic diagnosis of the\nfailures of syntactic parallelism. They simply stipulate that killing\nrobbers belongs with the other examples under \u201cthis but not\nso.\u201d A critic might respond that the entire \u201cthis but not\nso\u201d group looks suspiciously ad hoc. Why isn\u2019t\nJill\u2019s caring about her good-looking brother an instance of\ncaring about a handsome man? Granted that sibling affection is\ndifferent from sexual attraction, it is still care, in this case\ndirected at a man who happens to be handsome. Similarly, granted that\nexecuting criminals is different from murder, it is still an event in\nwhich people are killed. The Mohists could probably have found a more\ncompelling way to do justice to the distinctions at stake than by\ninsisting on the apparently paradoxical claim\u2014later attacked by\nXunzi\u2014that although robbers are people, killing robbers\nisn\u2019t killing people. One promising alternative consistent with\ntheir program might have been to distinguish between different kinds\nof killing. They could have pointed out that \u2018killing\npeople\u2019 refers generally to all kinds of actions in which one\nperson causes another to die. These include a range of more specific\nkinds of actions, among them intentional, morally wrong killing of the\ninnocent (murder) and community-sanctioned, morally justified killing\nof criminals (execution). Thus killing robbers could be an action of\nthe kind killing people without being of the kind morally\nwrong killing. \n\nThis is roughly the approach that\n Xunzi\n adopts in handling a related issue. He contends that a general term,\nsuch as \u2018honor\u2019 or \u2018disgrace\u2019, can have two or\nmore distinct uses, grounded in different bases or \u201cstarting\npoints\u201d (du\u0101n \u7aef). The different uses can be\nspecified by compounding (ji\u0101n \u517c) names in a way\nthat narrows their extension. He argues, for instance, that there are\ntwo kinds of honor and disgrace, \u201cmoral honor and\ndisgrace\u201d and \u201cstatus honor and disgrace.\u201d A person\ncould be honored with high status while in fact being morally\ndisgraceful or held in disgrace while in fact being morally\n honorable.[36]\n The Mohists could similarly distinguish two kinds of killing people,\n\u201cmoral killing\u201d and \u201cimmoral killing.\u201d\n\nWhy don\u2019t they? Part of the explanation, of course, may be\nsimply that this route didn\u2019t occur to them. Writing after the\nMohists and probably building on their work, Xunzi (or his\nghostwriter) seems to have improved on their semantic theory in this\n respect.[37]\n Unlike the Mohists, who as we saw distinguish only\n three sorts\n of names\u2014reaching, kind, and personal\u2014Xunzi distinguishes\nmany possible levels of general terms (g\u00f2ng\nm\u00edng \u5171\u540d), specifically explaining that,\namong general terms, a \u201ccompound\u201d name (such as\n\u2018moral killing\u2019) and a \u201csingle\u201d name (such as\n\u2018killing\u2019) can both refer to the same thing, the single\nname being more general. Xunzi\u2019s approach might help to resolve\nsome of the Mohists\u2019 concerns about name compounding.\n\nBut there may be another, deeper explanation as well. The Mohists seem\nnever to have moved fully beyond the one-name-one-thing view. The idea\nthat each unit of language should denote some discrete kind\n(l\u00e8i \u985e), or part of reality, lingers in their\ntreatment of the robbers example. Their study of name compounding\nshowed that the extension of most phrases is not determined merely by\nsumming the extensions of their component words. Unlike the case of\n\u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019, \u2018white horse\u2019 does not\ndenote the sum of all white things and all horses. The semantics of\nphrases or \u201cexpressions\u201d (c\u00ed \u8fad)\nrequires a separate explanation of its own, beyond our explanation of\nthe semantics of names (m\u00edng \u540d). Yet the\nrobbers example shows the Mohists treating phrases the same way they\nhandle names, attempting to pin down a one-to-one referential relation\nbetween \u2018killing robbers\u2019 or \u2018caring about handsome\nmen\u2019 and distinct kinds of sh\u00ed \u5be6 (stuff,\nsituations). They still seem to assume that the key to distinguishing\nkinds correctly and reliably lies in specifying the discrete kind of\nsh\u00ed denoted by each expression. Specifying one-to-one\nreference relations in this way, so as to eliminate uncertainty or\nambiguity in distinguishing the things denoted by each name, is\nprecisely what texts such as the\n Analects,\n Xunzi, and The Annals of L\u00fc Buwei call\n\u201crectifying names\u201d (zh\u00e8ng m\u00edng\n\u6b63\u540d). So, as Hansen observes (1992, 251), in the\n\u201cLesser Selection\u201d the Mohists are in effect aiming to\nrectify phrases, instead of only names. They stipulate, for instance,\nthat \u2018killing people\u2019 be used to refer only to a certain\nkind of sh\u00ed (stuff, event, situation), distinct from\nthat denoted by \u2018killing robbers\u2019. The simple\none-name-one-thing view has no room for referential ambiguity or for\nterms of different scope, some of whose extensions fall within others.\nIt holds that the extensions of different phrases must be\ndistinct\u2014as, on a commonsense interpretation, those of\n\u2018killing robbers\u2019 and \u2018killing people\u2019 are\nnot\u2014or confusion and error will result. But this view has\ncounterintuitive consequences, and there are more compelling\nalternatives, as we have seen. To more fully exploit the resources\nprovided by their approach to semantics, the Mohists needed to break\nwith the one-name-one-thing model more decisively. \n8. Concluding Remarks\n\nIn later Mohist philosophy, we see ancient Chinese thinkers making\nremarkable advances in ethics, philosophy of language, epistemology,\nand informal logic. In each of these areas, the Mohists develop\ncredible, even brilliant theories and discover philosophical problems\nthat they grapple with vigorously, if not always fully successfully.\nTheir ethical theory is a tremendous achievement: history\u2019s\nfirst explicit form of indirect consequentialism, grounded in a\nconception of benefit or welfare as what produces happiness. Their\nnaturalistic semantic theory and epistemology offer an intriguing,\nnon-mentalistic approach to language, mind, and knowledge, one that\ndeserves further attention today. They pioneer the study of logic in\nChina and develop an interesting theory of analogical argumentation,\nthough making only limited progress in exploring cogency in analogical\nextension. And this is not to mention their investigations in\nmetaphysics, mechanics, optics, and geometry. Regrettably, the\nMohists\u2019 multifaceted inquiries came to an end as their movement\nfaded away during the first century of the former Han dynasty (206\nB.C.E.\u20138 C.E.). Interest in issues inspired by language arose\nagain among a few intellectuals during the later Han (25\u2013220\nC.E.) and the Wei-Jin period (220\u2013589 C.E.), but in ethical\ntheory, language, logic, and epistemology, later Chinese thinkers\nnever surpassed the achievements of their classical forebears.\n",
