    "main_text": "Emotions in Early Chinese Philosophical Texts || The Mencius\n5.3 The Mencius\n\nBy following Confucius\u2019s views on the genuineness of emotion in\nmoral virtues, Mencius (372\u2013289 BCE) develops a\nmoral-psychological explanation of the heart-mind (xin\n\u5fc3) and its innate moral foundations with spontaneous arousal\nand motivational purity. He puts moral emotions at the center of his\nphilosophy and argues that the affective genuineness of Confucian\nvirtues emerges from innately given affective inclinations. His four\nmoral sprouts (siduan \u56db\u7aef, the four\nmoral-psychological foundations of Confucian virtues) are the\nheart-mind of pity and compassion (\u60fb\u96b1), shame and\ndislike (\u7f9e\uf9b9), modesty and compliance (\u8fad\u8b93),\nand approve and disapprove (\u662f\u975e) (Mencius, 2A6,\n6A6). For example, one cannot bear to see the suffering of others and\nquickly develops empathic concern for them.  This naturally aroused\naffective inclination is the foundation of the Confucian virtue of\nbenevolence (ren) (Mencius, 2A6). He often compares\nthe cultivation of the moral sprouts to an agricultural process: the\nsprouts can grow naturally because of their inborn nature under the\nparticular external conditions (such as water, soil, and nutrition)\nfor their full maturation. From this onto-generative and innate\nviewpoint of moral emotions, one can see the moral-psychological\nconnection between qing and emotions.  Even though no\nexplicit connection between qing and emotions is made in\nthe Mencius, the genuineness of the human mind in Confucian\nvirtues such as ren (\u4ec1 benevolence), yi\n(\u7fa9 righteousness), li (\uf9b6 ritual propriety), and\nzhi (\u667a wisdom) is traced back to the inborn nature or\nessence, (i.e, qing) of humanity that manifests itself in\nsuch emotional reactions as buren (\uf967\u5fcd not bearing to see\nothers\u2019 suffering) or ceyin (\u60fb\u96b1 pity and\ncompassion).\n\n\nWhen I say that all men have the mind which cannot bear to see the\nsuffering of others, my meaning may be illustrated thus: Now, when men\nsuddenly see a child about to fall into a well, they all have a\nfeeling of alarm and distress, not to gain friendship with the\nchild\u2019s parents, not to seek the praise of their neighbors and\nfriends, nor because they dislike the reputation [of lack of humanity\nif they did not rescue the child]. From such a case, we see that a man\nwithout the feeling of commiseration is not a man; a man without the\nfeeling of shame and dislike is not a man; a man without the feeling\nof deference and compliance is not a man; and a man without the\nfeeling of right or wrong is not a man. (Mencius, 2A6; Chan\n1963: 65)\n\n\nAs one can see in Mencius\u2019s discussion of the four moral sprouts\nin this passage, Mencius\u2019s moral psychology of the heart-mind\nfocuses on the psychological and ontological foundation of moral\nemotions. According to him, Confucian virtues derive from the innate\nfoundations (siduan) and these foundations are naturally\ngiven affective moral inclinations. As Confucius stresses the\nsignificance of sincere emotions in the cultivation of virtues,\nMencius highlights their innate emotional foundations. However, these\nare not just psychological foundations. They are ontological\nfoundations, too. He (2A6) states, for example, lacking the heart-mind\nof ceyin means lacking the essence of humanity. This\nfoundational and ontological approach in Mencius\u2019s moral\nphilosophy provides a stimulating opportunity to connect emotions\n(affective inclinations) and qing (genuine nature) in the\ncontext of the four moral sprouts.\n\nAccording to Mencius, certain emotions are aroused by innately given\npsychological orientations of the mind that flow spontaneously from\nthe original nature of human beings. The four moral sprouts\n(siduan) are such emotions that deserve careful cultivation\nbecause their genuineness derives from human nature. Mencius (2A6,\n6A6) believes that emotions, like living organisms, have roots and\nfoundations, grows and expands, and reaches out to realize their\nnatural potential. They begin and grow like a fire that starts to\nspark and a spring that breaks out (2A6). They should not be\nobstructed or stopped. They should be developed and cultivated to\nrealize their full potential. This is Mencius\u2019s\nmoral-psychological nativism that highlights the affective and\ngenerative moral sprouts at the foundation of the heart-mind and human\nnature (Seok 2008).\n\nFlanagan (2014) characterizes Mencius\u2019s moral psychology of the\nfour moral sprouts as natural teleology because the moral emotions\nhave deep foundations in human nature with the designated endpoints,\ni.e., Confucian virtues. This ontological and teleological approach to\nemotions shows why emotions are important in Confucian philosophy and\nhow emotions and qing can relate to each other. For example,\nqing appears four times (3A4, 4B46, 6A6, 6A8) in the\nMencius and they mean nature/essence or situation/reality.\nGenerally, the semantic content of qing in the\nMencius follows that of the Analects: qing\nis not directly related to inner subjective feelings. Wu\nzhi qing (\u7269\u4e4b\u60c5) means nature of things (3A4)\nand ren zhi qing (\u4eba\u4e4b\u60c5) means the nature\nor natural disposition of human beings (6A8). In 6A6,\nhowever, qing is used to explain the goodness of human nature\nin the context of affective feelings, i.e., the four moral sprouts. He\nstates that \u201cFrom the feelings [qing] proper to it\n[nature], it is constituted for the practice of what is good\u201d\n(6A6; Legge 1960b: 402). In this passage, qing refers to the\nfoundation or root of the moral emotions. Mencius explains that all\nhumans, despite their individual differences, have the same foundation\nof goodness such as the four moral sprouts which are basically moral\nfeelings. These feelings are the foundational essences (qing)\nof humanity that can become virtuous through the process of\ncultivation and learning. Although\nqing in this passage does not refer to inner subjective\nstates of the mind, it means genuine and truthful dispositions of\nhuman beings such as the affective orientations of the mind that can\nbe observed in the four moral sprouts. In this passage, qing\n(nature/essence) comes close to emotions and feelings, not just random\nfeelings but certain feelings with specific innate inclinations that\nreflect underlying nature of human beings. Here, Mencius opens the\ndoor to emotional qing in his discussion of how human beings\ncan become virtuous through the innately given affective sprouts of\nmorality.\n\nOther than the four moral sprouts and their foundational nature,\nMencius discusses emotions and subjective feelings of love, concern,\nand sadness. For example, he discusses king Shun\u2019s (\u821c)\nemotions such as sorrow and love to his parents and brother and\nexplains true filial piety (5A1). Shun\u2019s parents and brother\ntried to kill him but he kept his sincere feelings for them. Like\nConfucius, Mencius believes that genuine emotions are critical\ncomponent of ideal moral virtues. He also points out how emotions\nchange our sense of appropriateness and motivate to adopt certain\nnorms. He states that\n\n\nAnciently, there was no rule for the size of either the inner or the\nouter coffin. In middle antiquity, the inner coffin was made seven\ninches thick, and the outer one the same. This was done by all, from\nthe sovereign to the common people, and not simply for the beauty of\nthe appearance, but because they thus satisfied the natural feelings\nof their hearts [ren xin \u4eba\u5fc3]. (Mencius, 2B16;\nLegge 1960b: 221)\n\n\nIt seems that the thickness of coffin has little to do with emotions\nor feelings but Mencius explains that our feelings for deceased people\nis the reason why the inner coffin has certain thickness. It is not\nbecause of an aesthetic consideration, a universal principle, or a\nsense of duty but because of an affective sense for others that\nmotivated the decision to adopt the particular thickness. From this\nperspective, one can easily understand Mencius\u2019s criticism (3B9)\nof Yang Zhu\u2019s and Mo Di\u2019s views (Yangism and Mohism).\nYang\u2019s view is egoism that promotes one\u2019s self-interest\nbut does not acknowledge the authority of one\u2019s ruler.\nMo\u2019s view is impartial caring that supports the benefit of\nothers but does not recognize one\u2019s feelings and respect for\none\u2019s parents. Mencius states that \u201cto acknowledge neither\nking nor father is to be in the state of a beast\u201d (3B9; Legge\n1960b: 282). It is important to note that what Mencius criticizes here\nis not simply their rejection of the authority of ruler and father.\nRather it is their denial of the caring heart at the center of\nmorality that renders humanity little more than bests. Mencius\nexplains why feelings and emotions for others, specifically for our\nparents, is important and why Yangism and Mohism fail: they propose\nuncaring ways of life. This is clearly presented in Mencius\u2019s\ncomment on Mohist thinker Yi Zhi\u2019s (\u5937\u5b50) view. Mencius\ndiscusses the following example.\n\n\nIn great antiquity there were some who did not bury their parents.\nWhen their parents died, they took them up and threw them into a\nditch. Later when they passed by them and saw foxes and wild cats\neating them and flies and gnats eating them, their perspiration\nstarted out upon their foreheads, they looked askance and could not\nbear to look straight. Now the perspiration was not for the sake of\nother people. It was something at the bottom of their hearts that\nshowed in their expressions. Their immediately went home and returned\nwith baskets and spades and covered the bodies. If it was indeed right\nto cover them, then there must be certain moral principles which made\nfilial sons and men of humanity inter their parents.\n(Mencius, 3A5; Chan 1963: 71)\n\n\nIn this passage, Mencius clearly states that the physical changes in\nthe body are not caused by one\u2019s deliberation or consideration\nof reputation and reward. They simply come out from the bottom of the\nheart (zhong xin \u4e2d\u5fc3\u2014the center or core of the\nheart-mind) in their feelings for others. He believes that Yangism and\nMohism miss this critical element of the affective moral mind.\nAccording to him, we are moral creatures because of the feelings and\nemotions that flow from our genuine nature in its caring heart-mind\nfor others.\n",
