It might be argued that just as\nequality of opportunity to become a flourishing individual is a matter\nof justice, so too is equality of opportunity to develop civic skills,\nand to participate effectively in political deliberations.\n\nThe structure and appropriate content of civic education is debated\nextensively. While some argue that citizenship education can be\nnarrowly construed so as to not encroach upon individuals\u2019\nprivate commitments, others claim it is a far more demanding\neducational endeavor. A key part of this debate is the extent to which\neducation requires the cultivation of autonomy, and if does, the\nnature of the autonomy that is required. Some claim that since some\ngroups in pluralistic democracies reject the idea of an autonomous\nlife, education for autonomy cannot be imposed upon them even for\ncivic purposes, and so education should not entail the cultivation of\nindividual autonomy (Galston 1989). Rawls\u2019 own solution to the\npotential clash between civic education for autonomy and\nindividuals\u2019 private commitments is to advocate only a limited\nform of autonomy, political autonomy, which \u201cleaves untouched\nall kinds of doctrines\u2014religious, metaphysical, and moral\u201d\nand yields a relatively thin civic education (Rawls 2005: 375). Others\ntake issue with this view, arguing that civic education requires an\nencompassing form of autonomy that has unavoidable spillover effects\ninto the private sphere of individuals\u2019 lives, and that may\nclash with some religious convictions (Callan 1997; Gutmann 1995; see\nalso Arneson & Shapiro 1996, for a discussion of Wisconsin v.\nYoder (1972), a U.S. Supreme Court case about religious\nexemptions from compulsory education).\n\nAnother dimension of ongoing debates about equality in the realm of\ncivic education concerns the scope of the community for which we are\neducating students to become members. Is the right unit of analysis a\nparticular nation state or the global community? If it is a particular\nnation state, how can we cultivate in students a sense of their\nnational identity and the disposition to respect their state\u2019s\ninstitutions and laws (and to advocate reform when needed), while also\nmaking them sensitive to what they owe non-citizens as a matter of\njustice? A key component of this debate is whether students should\nreceive a patriotic civic education\u2014that is, one that\nprioritizes shoring up their allegiance to their state over their\ncapacity to reflect critically upon its potential shortcomings.\nGalston (1989) has notably argued that students need a civic education\nthat is more rhetorical than rational, while a number of liberal\ntheorists have criticized his view on grounds of democratic\nlegitimacy, its status-quo bias, and the related possibility of\nossifying existing inequalities (e.g., Brighouse 1998; Callan 1997;\nsee also the related entry on\n civic education).\n On the other hand, if we instead have a cosmopolitan view of civic\neducation and aim to cultivate \u201ccitizens of the world\u201d\n(e.g., Nussbaum & Cohen 1996), what are the relevant capacities\nthat need to be made effective? There is no world state for students\nto participate in.\n\nWhatever one believes about the appropriate scope and content of civic\neducation, a pressing issue is students\u2019 extremely uneven access\nto educational opportunities that prepare them for participatory\ncitizenship. Meira Levinson\u2019s work on the \u201ccivic\nachievement gap\u201d highlights this corollary to the much-more\ndiscussed achievement gap and underscores vast inequalities across\nstudent groups in terms of what youth know about how government works,\nand their ability to participate effectively in civic life (Levinson\n2012). These low rates of participation and engagement also have\nconsequences for how the interests of the poor are treated. Indeed,\neven if one rejects equality of opportunity in this domain, there is\nample evidence that many societies are not doing enough to enable\ntheir poorer and less educated citizens to effectively and competently\nparticipate in public life.\n",
