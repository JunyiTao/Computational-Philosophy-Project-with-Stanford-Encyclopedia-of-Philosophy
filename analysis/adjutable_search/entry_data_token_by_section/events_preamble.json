    "main_text": "\n\nSmiles, walks, dances, weddings, explosions, hiccups, hand-waves,\narrivals and departures, births and deaths, thunder and lightning: the\nvariety of the world seems to lie not only in the assortment of its\nordinary citizens\u2014animals, physical objects, social creatures of\nvarious kinds\u2014but also in the sort of things that happen to or\nare performed by them. In contemporary philosophy, this view has been\na focus of considerable debate, with implications reaching far into\nthe concern of other disciplines as well, above all linguistics and\nthe cognitive sciences. Indeed, there is little question that human\nperception, action, language, and thought manifest at least a\nprima facie commitment to entities of this sort:\n\nPre-linguistic infants appear to be able to discriminate and\n\u201ccount\u201d events, and the content of adult perception,\nespecially in the auditory realm, endorses the discrimination and\nrecognition as events of some aspects of the perceived\nscene.\nHumans (and, presumably, other animals) appear to form intentions\nto plan and execute actions, and to bring about events in the external\nworld.\nDedicated linguistic devices (such as verb tenses and aspects,\nnominalization of some verbs, certain proper names) are tuned to\nevents and event structures, as opposed to entities and structures of\nother sorts.\nThinking about the temporal and causal aspects of the world seems\nto require parsing those aspects in terms of events and their\ndescriptions.\n\n\nIt is, however, unclear to what extent such prima facie\ncommitments add up to an integrated phenomenon, as opposed to\nseparate, independent dispositions. Moreover, even among those who\nfavor a realist attitude towards the ontological status of events,\nthere is significant disagreement concerning the precise nature of\nsuch entities. (Their broad characterization as \u2018things that\nhappen\u2019, though commonly found in dictionaries, merely shifts\nthe burden to the task of clarifying the meaning of\n\u2018happen\u2019.) One useful approach is to set them against\nentities belonging to other, philosophically more familiar,\nmetaphysical categories. In the following we review the main contrasts\nbetween events and those categories that in the literature have been\nput forward explicitly as their ontological competitors, or at least\nas categories exhibiting significant differences with the category of\nevents. Along the way, we shall also review the main conceptual tools\nthat metaphysicians and other philosophers have adopted in their\nattempts to deal with events, either from a realist or from a\nnon-realist perspective.\n",
