    "main_text": "Observation and data || Data and phenomena\n2.3 Data and phenomena\n\nDeposing observation from its traditional perch in empiricist\nepistemologies of science need not estrange philosophers from\nscientific practice. Terms like \u2018observation\u2019 and\n\u2018observation reports\u2019 do not occur nearly as much in\nscientific as in philosophical writings. In their place, working\nscientists tend to talk about data. Philosophers who adopt\nthis usage are free to think about standard examples of observation as\nmembers of a large, diverse, and growing family of data production\nmethods. Instead of trying to decide which methods to classify as\nobservational and which things qualify as observables, philosophers\ncan then concentrate on the epistemic influence of the factors that\ndifferentiate members of the family. In particular, they can focus\ntheir attention on what questions data produced by a given method can\nbe used to answer, what must be done to use that data fruitfully, and\nthe credibility of the answers they afford (Bogen 2016).\n\nSatisfactorily answering such questions warrants further philosophical\nwork. As Bogen and Woodward (1988) have argued, there is often a long\nroad between obtaining a particular dataset replete with\nidiosyncrasies born of unspecified causal nuances to any claim about\nthe phenomenon ultimately of interest to the researchers. Empirical\ndata are typically produced in ways that make it impossible to predict\nthem from the generalizations they are used to test, or to derive\ninstances of those generalizations from data and non ad hoc auxiliary\nhypotheses. Indeed, it is unusual for many members of a set of\nreasonably precise quantitative data to agree with one another, let\nalone with a quantitative prediction. That is because precise,\npublicly accessible data typically cannot be produced except through\nprocesses whose results reflect the influence of causal factors that\nare too numerous, too different in kind, and too irregular in behavior\nfor any single theory to account for them. When Bernard Katz recorded\nelectrical activity in nerve fiber preparations, the numerical values\nof his data were influenced by factors peculiar to the operation of\nhis galvanometers and other pieces of equipment, variations among the\npositions of the stimulating and recording electrodes that had to be\ninserted into the nerve, the physiological effects of their insertion,\nand changes in the condition of the nerve as it deteriorated during\nthe course of the experiment. There were variations in the\ninvestigators\u2019 handling of the equipment. Vibrations shook the\nequipment in response to a variety of irregularly occurring causes\nranging from random error sources to the heavy tread of Katz\u2019s\nteacher, A.V. Hill, walking up and down the stairs outside of the\nlaboratory. That\u2019s a short list. To make matters worse, many of\nthese factors influenced the data as parts of irregularly occurring,\ntransient, and shifting assemblies of causal influences.\n\nThe effects of systematic and random sources of error are typically\nsuch that considerable analysis and interpretation are required to\ntake investigators from data sets to conclusions that can be used to\nevaluate theoretical claims. Interestingly, this applies as much to\nclear cases of perceptual data as to machine produced records. When\n19th and early 20th century astronomers looked\nthrough telescopes and pushed buttons to record the time at which they\nsaw a star pass a crosshair, the values of their data points depended,\nnot only upon light from that star, but also upon features of\nperceptual processes, reaction times, and other psychological factors\nthat varied from observer to observer. No astronomical theory has the\nresources to take such things into account.\n\nInstead of testing theoretical claims by direct comparison to the data\ninitially collected, investigators use data to infer facts about\nphenomena, i.e., events, regularities, processes, etc. whose instances\nare uniform and uncomplicated enough to make them susceptible to\nsystematic prediction and explanation (Bogen and Woodward 1988, 317).\nThe fact that lead melts at temperatures at or close to 327.5 C is an\nexample of a phenomenon, as are widespread regularities among\nelectrical quantities involved in the action potential, the motions of\nastronomical bodies, etc. Theories that cannot be expected to predict\nor explain such things as individual temperature readings can\nnevertheless be evaluated on the basis of how useful they are in\npredicting or explaining phenomena. The same\nholds for the action potential as opposed to the electrical data from\nwhich its features are calculated, and the motions of astronomical\nbodies in contrast to the data of observational astronomy. It is\nreasonable to ask a genetic theory how probable it is (given similar\nupbringings in similar environments) that the offspring of a parent or\nparents diagnosed with alcohol use disorder will develop one or more\nsymptoms the DSM classifies as indicative of alcohol use disorder. But\nit would be quite unreasonable to ask the genetic theory to predict or\nexplain one patient\u2019s numerical score on one trial of a\nparticular diagnostic test, or why a diagnostician wrote a particular\nentry in her report of an interview with an offspring of one of such\nparents (see Bogen and Woodward, 1988,\n319\u2013326).\n\nLeonelli has challenged Bogen and Woodward\u2019s (1988) claim that\ndata are, as she puts it, \u201cunavoidably embedded in one\nexperimental context\u201d (2009, 738). She argues that when data are\nsuitably packaged, they can travel to new epistemic contexts and\nretain epistemic utility\u2014it is not just claims about\nthe phenomena that can travel, data travel too. Preparing data for\nsafe travel involves work, and by tracing data \u2018journeys,\u2019\nphilosophers can learn about how the careful labor of researchers,\ndata archivists, and database curators can facilitate useful data\nmobility. While Leonelli\u2019s own work has often focused on data in\nbiology, Leonelli and Tempini (2020) contains many diverse case\nstudies of data journeys from a variety of scientific disciplines that\nwill be of value to philosophers interested in the methodology and\nepistemology of science in practice.\n\nThe fact that theories typically predict and explain features of\nphenomena rather than idiosyncratic data should not be interpreted as\na failing. For many purposes, this is the more useful and illuminating\ncapacity. Suppose you could choose between a theory that predicted or\nexplained the way in which neurotransmitter release relates to\nneuronal spiking (e.g., the fact that on average, transmitters are\nreleased roughly once for every 10 spikes) and a theory which\nexplained or predicted the numbers displayed on the relevant\nexperimental equipment in one, or a few single cases. For most\npurposes, the former theory would be preferable to the latter at the\nvery least because it applies to so many more cases. And similarly for\ntheories that predict or explain something about the probability of\nalcohol use disorder conditional on some genetic factor or a theory\nthat predicted or explained the probability of faulty diagnoses of\nalcohol use disorder conditional on facts about the training that\npsychiatrists receive. For most purposes, these would be preferable to\na theory that predicted specific descriptions in a single particular\ncase history.\n\nHowever, there are circumstances in which scientists do want to\nexplain data. In empirical research it is often crucial to getting a\nuseful signal that scientists deal with sources of background noise\nand confounding signals. This is part of the long road from newly\ncollected data to useful empirical results. An important step on the\nway to eliminating unwanted noise or confounds is to determine their\nsources. Different sources of noise can have different characteristics\nthat can be derived from and explained by theory. Consider the\ndifference between \u2018shot noise\u2019 and \u2018thermal\nnoise,\u2019 two ubiquitous sources of noise in precision electronics\n(Schottky 1918; Nyquist 1928; Horowitz and Hill 2015). \u2018Shot\nnoise\u2019 arises in virtue of the discrete nature of a signal. For\ninstance, light collected by a detector does not arrive all at once or\nin perfectly continuous fashion. Photons rain onto a detector shot by\nshot on account of being quanta. Imagine building up an image one\nphoton at a time\u2014at first the structure of the image\nis barely recognizable, but after the arrival of many photons, the\nimage eventually fills in. In fact, the contribution of noise of this\ntype goes as the square root of the signal. By contrast, thermal noise\nis due to non-zero temperature\u2014thermal fluctuations\ncause a small current to flow in any circuit. If you cool your\ninstrument (which very many precision experiments in physics do) then\nyou can decrease thermal noise. Cooling the detector is not going to\nchange the quantum nature of photons though. Simply collecting more\nphotons will improve the signal to noise ratio with respect to shot\nnoise. Thus, determining what kind of noise is affecting one\u2019s\ndata, i.e. explaining features of the data themselves that are\nidiosyncratic to the particular instruments and conditions prevailing\nduring a specific instance of data collection, can be critical to\neventually generating a dataset that can be used to answer questions\nabout phenomena of interest. In using data that require statistical\nanalysis, it is particularly clear that \u201cempirical assumptions\nabout the factors influencing the measurement results may be used to\nmotivate the assumption of a particular error distribution\u201d,\nwhich can be crucial for justifying the application of methods of\nanalysis (Woodward 2011, 173).\n\nThere are also circumstances in which scientists want to provide a\nsubstantive, detailed explanation for a particular idiosyncratic\ndatum, and even circumstances in which procuring such explanations is\nepistemically imperative. Ignoring outliers without good epistemic\nreasons is just cherry-picking data, one of the canonical\n\u2018questionable research practices.\u2019 Allan Franklin has described Robert\nMillikan\u2019s convenient exclusion of data he collected from\nobserving the second oil drop in his experiments of April 16, 1912\n(1986, 231). When Millikan initially recorded the data for this drop,\nhis notebooks indicate that he was satisfied his apparatus was working\nproperly and that the experiment was running well\u2014he\nwrote \u201cPublish\u201d next to the data in his lab notebook.\nHowever, after he had later calculated the value for the fundamental\nelectric charge that these data yielded, and found it aberrant with\nrespect to the values he calculated using data collected from other\ngood observing sessions, he changed his mind, writing\n\u201cWon\u2019t work\u201d next to the calculation (ibid., see\nalso Woodward 2010, 794). Millikan not only never published this\nresult, he never published why he failed to publish it. When data are\nexcluded from analysis, there ought to be some explanation justifying\ntheir omission over and above lack of agreement with the\nexperimenters\u2019 expectations. Precisely because they are\noutliers, some data require specific, detailed, idiosyncratic causal\nexplanations. Indeed, it is often in virtue of those very explanations\nthat outliers can be responsibly rejected. Some explanation of data\nrejected as \u2018spurious\u2019 is required. Otherwise, scientists\nrisk biasing their own work.\n\nThus, while in transforming data as collected into something useful\nfor learning about phenomena, scientists often account for features of\nthe data such as different types of noise contributions, and sometimes\neven explain the odd outlying data point or artifact, they simply do\nnot explain every individual teensy tiny causal contribution to the\nexact character of a data set or datum in full detail. This is because\nscientists can neither discover such causal minutia nor would their\ninvocation be necessary for typical research questions. The fact that\nit may sometimes be important for scientists to provide detailed\nexplanations of data, and not just claims about phenomena inferred\nfrom data, should not be confused with the dubious claim that\nscientists could \u2018in principle\u2019 detail every causal quirk\nthat contributed to some data (Woodward 2010; 2011).\n\nIn view of all of this, together with the fact that a great many\ntheoretical claims can only be tested directly against facts about\nphenomena, it behooves epistemologists to think about how data are\nused to answer questions about phenomena. Lacking space for a detailed\ndiscussion, the most this entry can do is to mention two main kinds of\nthings investigators do in order to draw conclusions from data. The\nfirst is causal analysis carried out with or without the use of\nstatistical techniques. The second is non-causal statistical\nanalysis.\n\nFirst, investigators must distinguish features of the data that are\nindicative of facts about the phenomenon of interest from those which\ncan safely be ignored, and those which must be corrected for.\nSometimes background knowledge makes this easy. Under normal\ncircumstances investigators know that their thermometers are sensitive\nto temperature, and their pressure gauges, to pressure. An astronomer\nor a chemist who knows what spectrographic equipment does, and what\nshe has applied it to will know what her data indicate. Sometimes it\nis less obvious. When Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal looked through his\nmicroscope at a thin slice of stained nerve tissue, he had to figure\nout which, if any, of the fibers he could see at one focal length\nconnected to or extended from things he could see only at another\nfocal length, or in another slice. Analogous considerations apply to\nquantitative data. It was easy for Katz to tell when his equipment was\nresponding more to Hill\u2019s footfalls on the stairs than to the\nelectrical quantities it was set up to measure. It can be harder to\ntell whether an abrupt jump in the amplitude of a high frequency EEG\noscillation was due to a feature of the subjects brain activity or an\nartifact of extraneous electrical activity in the laboratory or\noperating room where the measurements were made. The answers to\nquestions about which features of numerical and non-numerical data are\nindicative of a phenomenon of interest typically depend at least in\npart on what is known about the causes that conspire to produce the\ndata.\n\nStatistical arguments are often used to deal with questions about the\ninfluence of epistemically relevant causal factors. For example, when\nit is known that similar data can be produced by factors that have\nnothing to do with the phenomenon of interest, Monte Carlo\nsimulations, regression analyses of sample data, and a variety of\nother statistical techniques sometimes provide investigators with\ntheir best chance of deciding how seriously to take a putatively\nilluminating feature of their data.\n\nBut statistical techniques are also required for purposes other than\ncausal analysis. To calculate the magnitude of a quantity like the\nmelting point of lead from a scatter of numerical data, investigators\nthrow out outliers, calculate the mean and the standard deviation,\netc., and establish confidence and significance levels. Regression and\nother techniques are applied to the results to estimate how far from\nthe mean the magnitude of interest can be expected to fall in the\npopulation of interest (e.g., the range of temperatures at which pure\nsamples of lead can be expected to melt).\n\nThe fact that little can be learned from data without causal,\nstatistical, and related argumentation has interesting consequences\nfor received ideas about how the use of observational evidence\ndistinguishes science from pseudoscience, religion, and other\nnon-scientific cognitive endeavors. First, scientists are not the only\nones who use observational evidence to support their claims;\nastrologers and medical quacks use them too. To find epistemically\nsignificant differences, one must carefully consider what sorts of\ndata they use, where it comes from, and how it is employed. The\nvirtues of scientific as opposed to non-scientific theory evaluations\ndepend not only on its reliance on empirical data, but also on how the\ndata are produced, analyzed and interpreted to draw conclusions\nagainst which theories can be evaluated. Secondly, it does not take\nmany examples to refute the notion that adherence to a single,\nuniversally applicable \u2018scientific method\u2019 differentiates\nthe sciences from the non-sciences. Data are produced, and used in far\ntoo many different ways to treat informatively as instances of any\nsingle method. Thirdly, it is usually, if not always, impossible for\ninvestigators to draw conclusions to test theories against\nobservational data without explicit or implicit reliance on\ntheoretical resources.\n\nBokulich (2020) has helpfully outlined a taxonomy of various ways in\nwhich data can be model-laden to increase their epistemic utility. She\nfocuses on seven categories: data conversion, data correction, data\ninterpolation, data scaling, data fusion, data assimilation, and\nsynthetic data. Of these categories, conversion and correction are\nperhaps the most familiar. Bokulich reminds us that even in the case\nof reading a temperature from an ordinary mercury thermometer, we are\n\u2018converting\u2019 the data as measured, which in this case is\nthe height of the column of mercury, to a temperature (ibid., 795). In\nmore complicated cases, such as processing the arrival times of\nacoustic signals in seismic reflection measurements to yield values\nfor subsurface depth, data conversion may involve models (ibid.). In\nthis example, models of the composition and geometry of the subsurface\nare needed in order to account for differences in the speed of sound\nin different materials. Data \u2018correction\u2019 involves common\npractices we have already discussed like modeling and mathematically\nsubtracting background noise contributions from one\u2019s dataset\n(ibid., 796). Bokulich rightly points out that involving models in\nthese ways routinely improves the epistemic uses to which data can be\nput. Data interpolation, scaling, and \u2018fusion\u2019 are also\nrelatively widespread practices that deserve further philosophical\nanalysis. Interpolation involves filling in missing data in a patchy\ndata set, under the guidance of models. Data are scaled when they have\nbeen generated in a particular scale (temporal, spatial, energy) and\nmodeling assumptions are recruited to transform them to apply at\nanother scale. Data are \u2018fused,\u2019 in Bokulich\u2019s\nterminology, when data collected in diverse contexts, using diverse\nmethods are combined, or integrated together. For instance, when data\nfrom ice cores, tree rings, and the historical logbooks of sea\ncaptains are merged into a joint climate dataset. Scientists must take\ncare in combining data of diverse provenance, and model new\nuncertainties arising from the very amalgamation of datasets (ibid.,\n800).\n\nBokulich contrasts \u2018synthetic data\u2019 with what she calls\n\u2018real data\u2019 (ibid., 801\u2013802). Synthetic data are virtual,\nor simulated data, and are not produced by physical interaction with\nworldly research targets. Bokulich emphasizes the role that simulated\ndata can usefully play in testing and troubleshooting aspects of data\nprocessing that are to eventually be deployed on empirical data\n(ibid., 802). It can be incredibly useful for developing and\nstress-testing a data processing pipeline to have fake datasets whose\ncharacteristics are already known in virtue of having been produced by\nthe researchers, and being available for their inspection at will.\nWhen the characteristics of a dataset are known, or indeed can be\ntailored according to need, the effects of new processing methods can\nbe more readily traced than without. In this way, researchers can\nfamiliarize themselves with the effects of a data processing pipeline,\nand make adjustments to that pipeline in light of what they learn by\nfeeding fake data through it, before attempting to use that pipeline\non actual science data. Such investigations can be critical to\neventually arguing for the credibility of the final empirical results\nand their appropriate interpretation and use.\n\nData assimilation is perhaps a less widely appreciated aspect of\nmodel-based data processing among philosophers of science, excepting\nParker (2016; 2017). Bokulich characterizes this method as \u201cthe\noptimal integration of data with dynamical model estimates to provide\na more accurate \u2018assimilation estimate\u2019 of the\nquantity\u201d (2020, 800). Thus, data assimilation involves\nbalancing the contributions of empirical data and the output of models\nin an integrated estimate, according to the uncertainties associated\nwith these contributions.\n\nBokulich argues that the involvement of models in these various\naspects of data processing does not necessarily lead to better\nepistemic outcomes. Done wrong, integrating models and data can\nintroduce artifacts and make the processed data unreliable for the\npurpose at hand (ibid., 804). Indeed, she notes that \u201c[t]here is\nmuch work for methodologically reflective scientists and philosophers\nof science to do in string out cases in which model-data symbiosis may\nbe problematic or circular\u201d (ibid.)\n",
