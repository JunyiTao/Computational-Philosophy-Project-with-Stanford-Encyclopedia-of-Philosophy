    "main_text": "Attempts to Defend Mentalism\n10. A Case for the Deontological Concept\n\nThe deontological concept of justification has not been supported by\nextensive argumentation, unlike the other internalist positions. But\nsome support for this concept can be provided, particularly from a\nclose examination of cases in which a person does not live up to\nsomething we regard as a norm, and with the result that justification\nis lacking. A striking example of just this sort concerns a\nclairvoyant named Maud.\n\nMaud believes herself to have the power of clairvoyance, though she\nhas no reasons for this belief. She maintains her belief despite being\ninundated by her embarrassed friends and relatives with massive\nquantities of apparently cogent scientific evidence that no such power\nis possible. One day Maud comes to believe, for no apparent reason,\nthat the President is in New York City, and she maintains this belief,\ndespite the lack of any independent evidence, appealing to her alleged\nclairvoyant power. Now in fact the President is in New York City, and\nMaud does, under the conditions then satisfied, have completely\nreliable clairvoyant power. Moreover, her belief about the President\ndid result from the operation of that power. (Bonjour 1980, 61)\n\n\nThe original aim in presenting this case, and other similar ones, is\nto criticize a reliabilist account of justification and knowledge. For\npresent purposes, interest in this example centers on a diagnosis of\nwhat has gone wrong with Maud's belief. The example indicates that\nMaud is being both irrational and irresponsible in maintaining belief\nin her clairvoyance when she has such powerful evidence to the\ncontrary. What Maud has done is to disregard evidence that she has on\nhand and that she either is or can easily be aware of, and it is this\nfact that leads us to the intuitively supported conviction that Maud's\nbelief about the President's whereabouts is not justified. It fails to\nbe justified precisely because Maud has been intellectually\nirresponsible in her belief formation.\n\nThis important example, and another concerning an individual,\nSamantha, who is also clairvoyant but who disregards a lot of evidence\nthat she has on hand to the effect that the President is not in New\nYork City (BonJour 1980), makes a strong case for the idea that there\nis some deontological component to the concept of epistemic\njustification. This deontological component may not be all there is to\nthe concept of justification, as defenders of the deontological\nconcept sometimes allege; but, these and related examples do strongly\nsupport the view that there is some deontological ingredient\nin our concept of justification.\n\nWe have seen that externalism is generally the denial of some\ninternalist position, typically regarding accessibility or mentalism\nas accounts of justifiers. It is not surprising, then, that major\narguments for externalism are, first, the failure or weakness in\narguments for either accessibility internalism or for mentalism.\nExternalism fares best on this count in regard to accessibility\ninternalism, since the arguments for that doctrine that we have\nconsidered are hardly compelling. Arguments for mentalism are in\nsomewhat better shape, for in many contexts it does appear that a\ndifference in mental states best explains a difference in the degree\nof justification for a belief. The support provided to mentalism by\nthis explanatory argument is limited, mainly because explaining a\ndifference in degree of justification falls short of\nestablishing that it is plausible to hold that all justifiers are\nmental items. But it cannot be denied that the explanatory argument\nconsidered earlier goes some way in this direction.\n\nExternalism is also supported to varying degrees by any cogent\ncriticisms that have been devised against internalism. On this score,\ntoo, it is accessibility internalism that is especially vulnerable,\nparticularly in the face of the perceptual examples already considered\nin which many justified beliefs are received either simultaneously or\nin rapid order.Further, there is the dilemma argument which poses a\nparticularly forceful challenge to access internalism. Mentalism is\nonly marginally better off in this regard, because as we noted\nearlier, the evidential support relations that obtain between\njustifiers and resulting beliefs seem themselves to be justifiers\nthough they are not mental states. Even if we allow that in simple\ncases one's justification for a belief that follows immediately from\none's understanding of simple premises from which the believed\nproposition follows, this sort of strategy will only work in a small\nclass of cases. Wherever the evidential support relations are more\ncomplex, mere understanding of the propositional content of the\njustifiers will not suffice to issue in justification for a resulting\nbelief. In other words, the above-discussed criticism of the mentalist\nposition concerning probabilistic relations, while perhaps not wholly\neffective, nonetheless has force against all but the simplest of\ncases, and to that extent the case for externalism is strengthened by\nthe weakening of the support for mentalism.\n\nExternalism is also supported by any general defense of theories which\nincorporate or imply it, such as the reliable process theory. This\nsort of defense of externalism, of course, is quite independent of\ncriticisms of accessibility internalism and of mentalism, and also\nindependent of critical attacks on arguments that support those\ninternalist positions.\n\nThere is, further, an important general argument for externalism\n(Goldman 2009). There is general agreement that certain epistemic\nprinciples concerning perception are correct. One such principle might\nbe,\n\nIf it seems to a subject S that she sees object O, then\nS is prima facie justified in believing that she sees O.\n\n\nWe then ask: Why do so many examples of noninferential J-principles\n(justification principles) center on perceptual experience...? Because\nthese are cases in which beliefs formed in accordance with these\nexperiences are usually true (Goldman 2009, 335). This\nperception-based principle is just one among many, such as those we\nmight adduce concerning memory, for example. In all of these cases,\nGoldman says, \u201cI claim that the underlying appeal of these\nJ-principles is a tacit recognition that they are truth conducive\n\u2026\u201d (ibid.). If this is correct, we are tacitly\nrecognizing a close connection between justification and truth\nconduciveness, which is a central tenet of the reliable process theory\nof justified belief. That theory thus provides a good explanation of\nwhy we regard such J-principles as correct, and this fact amounts to a\npositive argument in favor of the reliable process theory. That, in\nturn, is a positive argument in favor of externalism regarding\njustification. This line of argument, especially when extended to\ncases of inferentially justified beliefs, is of special significance,\nthen, because it is independent of arguments that criticize either\naccess internalism or mentalism. Externalism regarding justification,\nthus, need not be thought of as a perspective one \u201cbacks\ninto\u201d once one recognizes the shortcomings of internalist\npositions, but can be seen to stand on its own.\n",
