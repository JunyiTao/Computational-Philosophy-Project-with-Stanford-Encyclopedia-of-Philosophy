    "main_text": "The Debate About the Comprehensiveness of Liberalism || Liberal Theories of Value\n3.3 Liberal Theories of Value\n\nTurning from rightness to goodness, we can identify three main\ncandidates for a liberal theory of value. We have already encountered\nthe first: perfectionism. Insofar as perfectionism is a theory of\nright action, it can be understood as an account of morality.\nObviously, however, it is an account of rightness that presupposes a\ntheory of value or the good: the ultimate human value is developed\npersonality or an autonomous life. Competing with this objectivist\ntheory of value are two other liberal accounts: pluralism and\nsubjectivism.\n\nIn his famous defence of negative liberty, Berlin insisted that values\nor ends are plural, and further, the pursuit of one end necessarily\nimplies that other ends will not be achieved. In this sense ends\ncollide. In economic terms, the pursuit of one end entails opportunity\ncosts: foregone pursuits which cannot be impersonally shown to be less\nworthy. There is no interpersonally justifiable way to rank the ends,\nand no way to achieve them all. Each person must devote herself to\nsome ends at the cost of ignoring others. For the pluralist, then,\nautonomy, perfection or development are not necessarily ranked higher\nthan hedonistic pleasures, environmental preservation or economic\nequality. All compete for our allegiance, but because they are\nincommensurable, no choice can be interpersonally justified.\n\nThe pluralist is not a subjectivist: that values are many, competing\nand incommensurable does not imply that they are somehow dependent on\nsubjective experiences. But the claim that what a person values rests\non experiences that vary from person to person has long been a part of\nthe liberal tradition. To Hobbes, what one values depends on what one\ndesires (1948 [1651]: 48). Locke advances a \u2018taste theory of\nvalue\u2019:\n\nThe Mind has a different relish, as well as the Palate; and you will\nas fruitlessly endeavour to delight all Man with Riches or Glory,\n(which yet some Men place their Happiness in,) as you would satisfy\nall men\u2019s Hunger with Cheese or Lobsters; which, though very\nagreeable and delicious fare to some, are to others extremely nauseous\nand offensive: And many People would with reason preferr [sic] the\ngriping of an hungry Belly, to those Dishes, which are a Feast to\nothers. Hence it was, I think, that the Philosophers of old did in\nvain enquire, whether the Summum bonum consisted in Riches,\nor bodily Delights, or Virtue, or Contemplation: And they might have\nas reasonably disputed, whether the best Relish were to be found in\nApples, Plumbs or Nuts; and have divided themselves into Sects upon\nit. For\u2026pleasant Tastes depend not on the things themselves,\nbut their agreeableness to this or that particulare Palate, wherein\nthere is great variety\u2026(1975 [1706]: 269).\n\n\nThe perfectionist, the pluralist and the subjectivist concur on the\ncrucial point: the nature of value is such that reasonable people\npursue different ways of living. To the perfectionist, this is because\neach person has unique capacities, the development of which confers\nvalue on her life; to the pluralist, it is because values are many and\nconflicting, and no one life can include them all, or make the\ninterpersonally correct choice among them; and to the subjectivist, it\nis because our ideas about what is valuable stem from our desires or\ntastes, and these differ from one individual to another. All three\nviews, then, defend the basic liberal idea that people rationally\nfollow different ways of living. But in themselves, such notions of\nthe good are not full-fledged liberal ethics, for an additional\nargument is required linking liberal value with norms of equal\nliberty, and to the idea that other people command a certain respect\nand a certain deference simply by virtue of having values of their\nown. To be sure, Berlin seems to believe this is a very quick\nargument: the inherent plurality of ends points to the\npolitical preeminence of liberty (see, for example, Gray:\n2006). Guaranteeing each a measure of negative liberty is, Berlin\nargues, the most humane ideal, as it recognizes that \u2018human\ngoals are many\u2019, and no one can make a choice that is right for\nall people (1969: 171). It is here that subjectivists and pluralists\nalike sometimes rely on versions of moral contractualism. Those who\ninsist that liberalism is ultimately nihilistic can be interpreted as\narguing that this transition cannot be made successfully: liberals, on\ntheir view, are stuck with a subjectivistic or pluralistic theory of\nvalue, and no account of the right emerges from it.\n",
