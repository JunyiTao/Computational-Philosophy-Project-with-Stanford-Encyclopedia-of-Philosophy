So, for example, I might know myself by\nacquaintance, but I know the tallest man in Iowa only under a\ndescription.\n\nLudlow (2002) argued that the Cartesianism in Russell\u2019s\npsychology and epistemology led him into difficulties here. The\nproblem is that we can be in error as to whether we are directly\nacquainted with someone (did I really have lunch with a colleague or\nwas that a sophisticated hologram?) and this concern (coupled with the\nCartesianism that Russell held at that point in his career) propelled\nRussell to radically minimize the class of cases where we have\nacquaintance\u2014down to what he called \u201cegocentric\nparticulars,\u201d which is basically to say I\u2019m only\nacquainted with myself and sense data. This in turn led Russell to\nextend the theory of descriptions to almost all uses of\nnames\u2014treating them as definite descriptions in disguise.\n\nRussell could have saved himself from some of the more troubling\nconsequences of his view if he had jettisoned the Cartesianism and\nopted for a more liberal notion of acquaintance. Alternatively, if\nHawthorne and Manley (2012) are correct, the true mistake would have\ncome in at the beginning\u2014with the linking of acquaintance and\nreference. In their view a case can be made that reference comes much\ncheaper than Russell imagined. It would follow that descriptions need\nnot be relied upon as heavily as he imagined\n",
