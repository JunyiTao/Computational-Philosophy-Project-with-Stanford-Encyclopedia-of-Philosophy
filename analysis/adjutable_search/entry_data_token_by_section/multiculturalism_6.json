If we take these ideas seriously and\naccept both ontological and ethical individualism as discussed above,\nthen we are led to defend not special protections for groups but the\nindividual\u2019s right to form and leave associations. As\nChandran Kukathas (1995, 2003) argues, there are no group rights, only\nindividual rights. By granting cultural groups special protections and\nrights, the state oversteps its role, which is to secure civility, and\nrisks undermining individual rights of association. States should not\npursue \u201ccultural integration\u201d or \u201ccultural\nengineering\u201d but rather a \u201cpolitics of indifference\u201d\ntoward minority groups (2003, 15).\n\nOne limitation of such a laissez-faire approach is that\ngroups that do not themselves value toleration and freedom of\nassociation, including the right to dissociate or exit a group, may\npractice internal discrimination against group members, and the state\nwould have little authority to interfere in such associations. A\npolitics of indifference would permit the abuse of vulnerable members\nof groups (discussed below in 3.6), tolerating, in Kukathas\u2019s words,\n\u201ccommunities which bring up children unschooled and illiterate;\nwhich enforce arranged marriages; which deny conventional medical care\nto their members (including children); and which inflict cruel and\n\u2018unusual\u2019 punishment\u201d (Kukathas 2003, 134). To\nembrace such a state of affairs would be to abandon the values of\nautonomy and equality, values that many liberals take to be\nfundamental to any liberalism worth its name.\n",
