    "main_text": "History of the Rule of Law || Fuller\n3.6 Fuller\n\nLon Fuller believed that government in accordance with the forms and\nprocedures of law had a distinctive value that could help close the\ngap of separation between positive law, on the one hand, and morality\nand justice on the other. The conventional wisdom of the legal\npositivists held that laws could be impeccably drafted and\neven-handedly administered and still be hideously unjust: antebellum\nslave law in the United States and apartheid law in South Africa were\noften cited as examples. But Fuller believed, as a matter of political\npsychology, that there would be reluctance to use the forms of\nlaw\u2014general and public norms\u2014to embody and inscribe\ninjustice. He believed that \u201ccoherence and goodness [had] more\naffinity than coherence and evil\u201d, he thought bad things\nhappened in the dark as opposed to the sunlight of legality, and he\nmaintained that \u201ceven in the most perverted regimes there is a\ncertain hesitancy about writing cruelties, intolerances, and\ninhumanities into law\u201d (Fuller 1958: 636\u20137). \n\nFuller acknowledged that this link between legality and justice was\ntentative. It was certainly controversial. But whether this connection\nheld or not, he also wanted to insist that the complete absence of\nrespect for formal criteria of legality might deprive a system of\npower of its status as law:\n\n\nWhen a system calling itself law is predicated upon a general\ndisregard by judges of the terms of the laws they purport to enforce,\nwhen this system habitually cures its legal irregularities, even the\ngrossest, by retroactive statutes, when it has only to resort to\nforays of terror in the streets, which no one dares challenge, in\norder to escape even those scant restraints imposed by the pretense of\nlegality\u2014when all these things have become true of a\ndictatorship, it is not hard for me, at least, to deny to it the name\nof law. (Fuller 1958: 660)\n\n\nIn his 1964 book The Morality of Law, Fuller formulated\nprinciples of what he called \u201cthe inner morality of\nlaw\u201d\u2014principles requiring that laws be general, public,\nprospective, coherent, clear, stable, and practicable\u2014and he\nargued that these were indispensable to law-making. Reviewing\nFuller\u2019s book, H.L.A. Hart (1965) asked in what sense these\nprinciples could be called a \u201cmorality\u201d. They seemed to be\nmore like instrumental principles for effective legislation, and on\nHart\u2019s view, they were only as moral as the enterprise they made\npossible. \n\nFuller responded by denying that the significance of his eight\nprinciples was purely instrumental. They also constituted a morality\nof respect for the freedom and dignity of the agents addressed by the\nlaw: what they made possible was a mode of governance that worked\nthrough ordinary human agency rather than short-circuiting it through\nmanipulation or terror. This thesis was separate from the connection\nbetween law and morality intimated in Fuller 1958. But the two\naccounts of the moral significance of law were connected in a way that\nJohn Finnis explained:\n\n\nA tyranny devoted to pernicious ends has no self-sufficient reason to\nsubmit itself to the discipline of operating consistently through the\ndemanding processes of law, granted that the rational point of such\nself-discipline is the very value of reciprocity, fairness, and\nrespect for persons which the tyrant, ex hypothesis, holds in\ncontempt. (1980: 273)\n\n\nFuller\u2019s work on the Rule of Law had one last nuance. He\nunderstood that law constituted a distinct kind of governance that\nmight not be relevant for every task of the state. He contrasted it\nnot just with a Nazi-style reign of terror, but with the sort of\nmanagerial administration that might be necessary for allocative\ndecision-making in a mixed economy like the United States in the\n1960s. In modern political economy, said Fuller, we face problems of\ninstitutional design \u201cunprecedented in scope and\nimportance\u201d. Focusing more on the procedural side of the Rule of\nLaw, Fuller insisted that we lawyers acknowledge that although\n\u201c[a]djudication is a process with which we are familiar and\nwhich enables us to show to advantage our special talents\u201d,\nstill it may be \u201can ineffective instrument for economic\nmanagement\u201d (Fuller 1964: 176).\n",
