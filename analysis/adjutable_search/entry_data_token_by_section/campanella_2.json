The Sense of Things and Natural Magic\n\nOne aspect of Campanella\u2019s keen interest in natural philosophy was\nnatural magic, described with particular effectiveness in the fourth\nbook of his Del senso delle cose e della magia naturale\n(On the Sense of Things and On Natural Magic). The original\ndraft of this work goes back to the young friar\u2019s first stay in\nNaples, from 1590 to 1592. He came into contact there with\nGiambattista della Porta, one of the most celebrated Renaissance\nproponents of natural magic. The treatise was rewritten in the\nfollowing years and was published for the first time in Frankfurt in\n1620 in a Latin translation that was reprinted in Paris in 1636 and\n1637. The work had a notable European diffusion, provoking discussions\nand contrasting opinions. In this treatise Campanella set out his\nvision of the natural world as a living organism, whose individual\ncomponents partook of life, vitality and sensibility.\n\nThe central notion in the treatise is that of sensus (sense),\nwhich is directly connected to the principle of self-preservation.\nEvery being displays a tendency toward the conservation of its own\nlife and for this purpose is endowed, in varying proportions, with\nsense. This consists of the capacity to distinguish that which is\npositive and conducive to its life, and is consequently to be pursued\nand sought after, from that which is perceived as negative and\ndestructive, and consequently to be shunned and avoided. Some entities\nsuch as celestial bodies and light possess a sense that is much\nsharper and purer than that of animals. Others such as minerals and\nmetals have a sense that is more obtuse and obscure, due to the\nheaviness of matter. In animal organisms vital and cognitive functions\ndepend on the spiritus. Hot, mobile and passive, it is\nidentified with the organic soul. Rejecting the distinctions made by\nGalen between various abstract faculties, Campanella states that the\nspiritus is singular and has its seat in the brain, from\nwhere, flowing through very subtle nerve channels, it accomplishes its\nmultiple functions, both vital and cognitive. By means of the sense\norgans, it comes into contact with external reality; all passions and\ncognition derive from the modifications that it undergoes. Every\nsensation is a form of \u201ccontact\u201d on the part of the\nspiritus, that enters into a relation, via various sense\norgans, with the exhalations, motions and light coming from external\nobjects. The sensations that the spiritus experiences are the\nsource of all cognition: memory, imagination, reason and the intellect\nitself, which is nothing but weakened and distilled sense. There is no\nneed to postulate different and specific faculties for such\noperations, since they are all functions of the same sentient soul,\nthat is capable of preserving the modifications and impressions it\nreceives and of reviving and re-using them when similar situations\narise.\n\nWhen dealing with animals and human beings, Campanella underlies\naffinities as well as differences. He takes delight in producing\nevidence of the extraordinary capacities of animals. Furnished with\nsense organs that in some cases are superior to those of humans,\nanimals are able to achieve wondrous and ingenious things; they adopt\nforms of collective organization; they know how to make use of medical\nand military arts; moreover, they are endowed with a form of\nreasoning, of language, of natural prophecy and even of religion.\nThese analogies should not, however, obscure or cast doubt on the\nexcellence of the human condition. Humans are furnished with a\nspiritus that is far more refined and pure than that of\nanimals; it is able to move with agility within more spacious brain\ncells, enabling humans to develop more complex chains of argument. The\nauthentic and radical difference between animals and humans, however,\nconsists in the fact that the latter are endowed, not only with a\nspiritus, but also with an immaterial mens (mind) of\ndivine origin, that constitutes and is the basis of their specific\nmakeup. Humans do not exhaust all their capacities within the frame of\nthe natural world. They can project themselves by means of thought and\ndesire toward the infinite. They are able to go beyond the limits of\nnatural self-preservation and turn themselves toward higher goods and\nends. Above all, humans are free. In contrast to what happens to\nanimals, who are unable to disengage themselves from the demands of\nthe senses, humans can repel the compulsion of the passions in order\nto make choices that go beyond simple practical advantage and the\nimmediate satisfaction of needs. Humans can resist the siren song, as\ndid Ulysses who tied himself to the stake of reason.\n\nThe fourth book of Del senso delle cose is devoted to natural\nmagic. Approaching the theme of magic, Campanella begins by deploring\nthe vile and decadent condition into which this very noble science has\nfallen. In modern times, the name magician is given to\n\u201csuperstitious friends of demons\u201d who, instead of\ndedicating themselves to the patient study of nature, prefer to take a\n\u201cshort cut\u201d by asking demons for things that they cannot\nprovide but that they promise and pretend to be able to do. Della\nPorta\u2019s attempt to restore this doctrine was entirely praiseworthy but\nremained insufficient, because he restricted himself to speaking about\nthese arguments solely in a descriptive and empirical manner without\nsupplying philosophical explanations of phenomena. In listing the most\nbizarre occult properties of minerals, plants and animals in the\nmagical tradition, della Porta maintained that it was not possible to\noffer a rational explanation of the relations of sympathy and\nantipathy, of affinity and repulsion, that exist between natural\nentities and limited himself to delighting in the spectacle and\nentertainment provided by nature. Campanella, however, took it on\nhimself to reinterpret this tradition in light of his doctrine of the\nsense of things and of the spiritus. As Pliny the Elder had\nnoted (Natural History, XXX.i-ii), magic, an ancient form of\nwisdom of Persian origin, is constructed from the convergence of three\ndoctrines: religion, that purifies the soul and imprints faith, honor\nand reverence on the souls of those toward whom the magical operation\nis directed; medicine, that makes it possible to understand the powers\nof herbs, stones and metals; and, finally, astrology, a knowledge of\nwhich is indispensable for producing well-timed actions by selecting\nthe most favorable disposition of the stars. Magic is a wisdom that is\nat the same time speculative and practical, that applies its own body\nof knowledge to works that are useful to humankind. It can be divided\ninto three types: divine, natural, deceitful and diabolical. Essential\nboth for divine and natural magic is a genuine faith, which requires\npurity of heart and an intrinsic adherence on the part of the soul to\nthe divinity. Such faith, which renders human beings divine, confers\non them the capacity to perform operations on things and transform\nthem according to their own desires (Del senso delle cose,\npp. 221\u201322, 226\u201329). At the opposite pole to divine magic is the type\nthat is playful and deceitful, thanks to which charlatans skillfully\nproduce effects that stupefy ignorant people. These swindlers cause a\nleg to burst into flames, though in truth the leg is artificial; they\nplace a nail in their eye and another in their mouth, pretending that\nit has passed from one to the other; they seem to be pierced by fake\ndaggers and swords; and, using the laws of optics, they make it\npossible to see distant images.\n\nBeyond these deceits, that are believed to be genuine solely by the\nmasses and that turn out to be \u201cuseless fictions\u201d, the\nnucleus of the book is natural magic. On the one hand, it is connected\nto the arts and sciences: all wondrous inventions appear at first to\nbe the result of magical operations, until their true causes are\ndiscovered. On the other hand, its particular sphere is the knowledge\nof unusual and arcane events. Natural magic, by means of its body of\nknowledge, is able to produce specific alterations in the mobile and\ntenuous spiritus, which is capable of submitting to and\nreceiving any impression. The basic passions are pain and joy, love\nand hate, hope and fear. The magician is someone who has the ability\nto act on these passions by employing herbs, phrases, actions and\nanything else that might be suitable. This person will know how to\nincrease bodily powers, suggesting foods, drinks, climates, sounds,\nherbal and animal remedies that aid and strengthen vital energies and\ncounseling against anything that has to do with putrefaction and\ndeath.\n\nThe durability of sense in entities and in the air in latent\nforms\u2014as if asleep, waiting to be reawakened on specific\noccasions\u2014explains facts that are only apparently miraculous,\nsuch as the bleeding of a corpse in the presence of the murder: the\nvictim, if alerted through the air to the proximity of his killer, is\nagain agitated by anger and fear, discharging blood. Also linked to\nthe durability of affects and sense is the efficacy of the weapon\nsalve, attributed to Paracelsus, by means of which a wound can be\nhealed by putting ointment on the weapon that caused it, as if the\nspiritus enclosed in the wound acquires confidence by feeling\nthe cure via the air and experiences \u201calmost the joy of\nrevenge\u201d. It is also possible to explain a celebrated example\nfound in every book on magic: a drum made of sheep skin falls to\npieces when a drum made of wolf skin is sounded, reawakening its\nformer fear (Del senso delle cose, pp. 253\u201359).\n\nThe profound alterations that animal spirits can undergo explain the\ntrue and proper transformations that occur in someone who has been\nbitten by a rabid dog or in peasants from Puglia attacked by\ntarantulas. Campanella gives a very precise description of what\nhappens to those bitten by tarantulas, based on eye-witness accounts\nof the phenomenon: they become weak, dancing and jumping to the sound\nof various musical instruments, until they collapse in exhaustion. In\nboth cases acrid spirits introduced into the wound produce an\nalteration of the temperament and the imagination of the unfortunate\nvictims, in whose bodies the animal spirits of the creatures that have\nattacked them take the upper hand in a manner that is at variance with\nthose already there. By means of dancing and sweating, those bitten by\ntarantulas endeavor to expel the infected vapors. Usually, however,\nthe symptoms remain as long as the cause that produced them persists;\nand only the death of the spider that stung them will bring a true\nremission of their suffering. The connection between general and\nparticular causes is confirmed again by the odd case of the medical\nschool of Tropea in southern Italy, in which a nose was grafted onto a\nman who had lost his due to a wound. The doctors reconstructed the new\nnose from flesh taken from the arm of a servant. The new nose took\nroot and lived; but when the servant died, it putrefied, demonstrating\nthat the life that it had received from the new organism in which it\nwas inserted did not annihilate its original and deep-rooted\nconnection to the life of the servant.\n",
