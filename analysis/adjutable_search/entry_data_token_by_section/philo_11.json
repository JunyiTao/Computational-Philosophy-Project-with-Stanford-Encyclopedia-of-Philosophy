    "main_text": "Major Philosophical Themes and Methods in Philo || Powers of God and logos\n4.3 Powers of God and logos\n\nOne of the main Philonian concepts, power, is all the more complex\ngiven the varieties in Philo\u2019s prose when discussing it (Termini\n2000). These variations were probably a means to avoid the implication\nthat these powers had an ontological autonomy. Their nature, rather,\nis merely linguistic and functionalist. The number of God\u2019s\npower is not fixed and their relation to the logos is evoked\nvaguely or not at all. From a philosophical point of view, the\ngenealogy of dunamis is incredibly rich since each great\nGreek philosopher used it with his own semantic specificity. In the\nBible, God is omnipotent but there is no systematic presentation of\nHis powers. Just before the apparition of Middle Platonism,\ndunamis was present in Stoic doctrine, but with a more\nreduced range of meaning. The question of Philo\u2019s source(s) on\nthis point is very controversial, but the general structure is quite\nclear. His two main powers are the \u201ccreative power\u201d\n(theos) and \u201cregal power\u201d (kyrios)\n(Cher. 27\u20138). The beneficent and the legislative powers\nare subordinated to them, but in Spec. 1.45, Philo uses a\nPlatonic metaphor to assert that God is surrounded by a great number\nof powers who are like His bodyguards. Before trying to specify the\nrelation between these powers and the logos, it is necessary\nto add that dunamis is not only a metaphysical term. It bears\na psychological meaning as well, for example at Opif. 67 when\nPhilo evokes the division of the soul in a context both Aristotelian\nand Stoic. In Leg. 1.11, the division is more clearly Stoic,\nwith its seven traditional parts (the five senses, reproduction and\nspeech) but at the same time, Philo seems to adopt a dualistic\nposition, distinguishing a rational and irrational part of the soul.\nThe main problem, in human psychology as with the divine powers, lies\nin their relation to the logos.\n\nIt seems that Philo did his utmost to make the relation between God\nand the logos as complex as possible (Calabi 2008). As an\nexample of these difficulties, in Leg. 2.86, God is said to\nbe the supreme genus and His logos the second one.\nOther things, Philo adds, only exist in speech and sometimes amount to\nmere nothingness. In the third book of the same treatise\n(Leg. 3.175\u20136), the logos is defined as the\n\u201cti\u201d, i.e., the all-encompassing genus in the\nStoic system. To explain this definition, Philo specifies that\nGod\u2019s logos is the supreme genus of everything that was\nborn. From a philosophical point of view, if somebody remains in the\nworld of immanence, he can refer to the universal logos, and\nonly to him. But to see the logos as the ultimate expression\nof the absolute is for Philo an absolute impiety. In fact, the\nlogos is only God\u2019s shadow, His image, the instrument\nby which He created the world, or in a more anthropomorphic way, His\n\u201cfirst-born son\u201d or His deputy (Agr. 51). In\nFug. 109, the logos is said to be \u201cthe Son of\nGod and Sophia\u201d. The Pythagorean-Platonic model of Creation\nacting on undefined matter is thus both preserved and richly\ntransformed.\n\nGod is unity, and only unity. It is the logos which carries\nin itself the principle of contraries, mixing good and evil. This\nleads in turn to a distinction between ontology and methodology.\nAnyone who divinizes the world, seeing it as the most perfect\nexpression of the logos, is deeply wrong, since he omits God,\nthe truly supreme genus and the only one not to have been created. At\nthe same time, the exegete of God\u2019s word can occasionally lead\nto his commentary focusing on the logos, creating a false\nresemblance to Stoicism. However, the theologian is, mutatis\nmutandis, like the biologist who today chooses some cells to\nplace under his microscope. This act, of course, does not imply that\nthe biologist forgets the tissue of which these cells are a part.\nSimilarly, Philo\u2019s focus on logos should never suggest\nthat he feels a temptation toward Stoicism. Themes and language of\nimmanence are for him only a means to better understand the world\ncreated by God. When he praises the philosophers who recommend\n\u201cliving according to nature\u201d, he uses a famous Stoic\nformula, but immediately after explains that this means \u201cto\nfollow God\u201d (Migr. 128). For a Stoic, the two formulae\nwere strictly synonymous. In Philo\u2019s thought, the former is\nvalid only if it is followed by a reference to God, who is\ntranscendent by definition.\n\nThe intermediary status of the logos and the many nuances in\nthe expression of its nature do not prevent Philo from providing a\nmore or less systematic framework.\n\nThe logos, God\u2019s organon in the creation of\nthe world, is described in Opif. 20 as \u201cthe place of\nthe Ideas\u201d, a metaphoric expression since for Philo the\nintelligible world could not be contained in a place. While the\ndemiurge contemplates the Ideas in order to create the World in the\nTimaeus, in the De opificio, God not only creates\nthe Ideas but organizes them into an intelligible world. In\nHer. 119, the divine logos is said to be both sower\nand creator. The former word refers to a Stoic concept, that of\nspermatikoi logoi, defined as the rational patterns inherent\nin the principles of organization of the world, but which Philo\npreferred not to use with precision. The Quis heres is\nprobably the treatise in which Philo\u2019s reflection on the\nlogos\u2019 way of action is most complete, through the\nconcept of logos divider (tomeus). In Stoicism, one\nof the main functions of the logos is to establish the\nprinciple of the idi\u00f4s poion, that is to say, the\nabsolute specificity of each being in the world. In the Quis\nheres, perhaps under the influence of a Stoicized interpretation\nof the Timaeus, Philo explains how God created the four\nelements from undifferentiated matter, then individual beings, by\nmixing these elements together.\n\nAs was said rightly by Radice, the \n\n\nphilosophical doctrine of the powers\u2026 allowed Philo to maintain\nboth the oneness of God despite His many names and epithets, and the\ntranscendence of God despite His action on the world.
