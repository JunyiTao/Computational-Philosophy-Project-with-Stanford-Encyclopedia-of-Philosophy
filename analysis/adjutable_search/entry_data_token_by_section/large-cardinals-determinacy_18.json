    "main_text": "The Case for Definable Determinacy || Overlapping Consensus\n4.5  Overlapping Consensus\n\nWe have discussed two recovery results for\nADL(\u211d). First, ADL(\u211d)\nis implied by its structural consequences (Theorem 4.2). Second,\nADL(\u211d) is recovered by the generic\nabsoluteness that follows from large cardinals that imply\nADL(\u211d) (Theorem 4.11). \n\n These recovery results are not isolated occurrences. The technique\nused to establish them is known as the core model\ninduction. This technique has been used to show that many other\nstrong theories imply ADL(\u211d). This even holds\nfor theories that are incompatible with one another. For\nexample, consider the following: \n\n Theorem 4.12.  (Woodin) Assume ZFC + there is an \u03c91-dense ideal on \u03c91. Then ADL(\u211d).  \n\n\n Theorem 4.13.  (Steel) Assume ZFC + PFA. Then ADL(\u211d).  \n\n\nThese two theories are incompatible. There are many other\nexamples. In fact, the examples are so ubiquitous and the technique is\nso general that there is reason to believe that\nADL(\u211d) lies in the overlapping\nconsensus of all sufficiently strong, natural theories. \n\n Summary: ADL(\u211d) lies in the overlapping\nconsensus of numerous strong theories and so it inherits the\nconsiderations of each. Moreover, there is reason to believe that\nADL(\u211d) lies in the overlapping consensus\nof all sufficiently strong, \u201cnatural\u201d\ntheories. \n",
