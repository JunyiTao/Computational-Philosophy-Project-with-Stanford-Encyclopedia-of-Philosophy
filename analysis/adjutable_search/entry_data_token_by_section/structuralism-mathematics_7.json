    "main_text": "Category-Theoretic Structuralism || Categorical Foundations and Debates About Them\n3.2 Categorical Foundations and Debates About Them\n\nAs has been argued repeatedly in the literature along the lines just\nsummarized, category theory provides a more natural framework than\ntraditional set theory for mathematical or methodological\nstructuralism in mathematics. But what about its prospects as a form\nof philosophical structuralism, i.e., an alternative to the theories\nof Resnik, Shapiro, Hellman, etc.?  We already mentioned that Awodey\n(1996) also presents it as such; but this has led to ongoing\ncontroversies.  Hellmann (2003) contains a first critical discussion\nof philosophical claims such as Awodey\u2019s. That is to say,\nHellman\u2019s article raises several objections against the view\nthat category theory provides an adequate framework for a\nstructuralist account of mathematics in the philosophical sense. As we\nwill see, these objections are closely related to the status of\ncategory theory as a foundational discipline.\n\nRecently there has been much debate on which criteria a theory has to\nmeet in order to serve as a proper \u201cfoundation\u201d for\nmathematics. According to a helpful proposal in Tsementzis (2017), a\nfoundational system has to consist of three items, namely: \n\n a formal language; \n an axiomatic theory expressed in that language; and \n a rich universe of objects, described by the theory, in which all\nmathematical structures can be located, represented, or encoded. \n\n\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory clearly represents a foundational system\nin this sense.  The axioms of ZFC are usually formulated in a formal\nfirst-order language; and they describe a comprehensive universe, the\ncumulative hierarchy of sets, in which mathematical objects such as\nnumber systems, groups, rings, topological spaces, etc. can be\nrepresented.\n\nIn research on category theory from the 1960s onward, several\naxiomatizations of specific categories have been proposed as\nalternative foundations for mathematics.  This includes the axiom\nsystems describing the category of sets and functions, on the one\nhand, and the category of categories, on the other hand, as first\npresented in Lawvere (1964, 1966). Both were explicitly introduced as\nfoundational systems, and thus, as alternatives to Zermelo-Fraenkel\nset theory. More recently, elementary topos theory has been developed\nas a form of categorical set theory that can serve as a foundational\nsystem in the above sense (cf.  Landry & Marquis 2005, Marquis\n2013).\n\nThis puts us in a position to return to Hellman\u2019s 2003\nchallenge. The question of whether category theory can be used to\nformulate a version of philosophical structuralism is, in his view,\ndirectly related to the presumed autonomy of these new approaches from\ntraditional set theory. Building on Feferman (1977), he formulates two\ngeneral objections. Following Linnebo & Pettigrew (2011), we can\ncall the first the \u201clogical dependence\u201d objection. Its\ncore is the argument that category theory, general topos theory,\netc. are not autonomous of set theory in the end. The reason is that\nthe axiomatic specification of categories and topoi presupposes the\nprimitive concepts of operation, collection, and function, and the\nlatter need to be defined in a set theory such as ZFC. Categorical\nfoundations are therefore dependent on non-structural set theory.\n\nThe second argument against the autonomy of categorical foundations\nhas been called the \u201cmismatch objection\u201d.  It concerns the\ngeneral status of category theory or topos theory; and it is based on\nthe distinction between two ways of understanding mathematical axioms,\nnamely as \u201cstructural\u201d, \u201calgebraic\u201d,\n\u201cschematic\u201d or \u201cHilbertian\u201d, on the one hand,\nand as \u201cassertoric\u201d or \u201cFregean\u201d, on the other\nhand. As Hellman argues, foundational systems such as classical set\ntheory need to be assertoric in character, in the sense that their\naxioms describe a comprehensive universe of objects used for the\ncodification of other mathematical structures. Zermelo-Fraenkel set\ntheory is an assertoric, \u201ccontentual\u201d theory in this\nsense. Its axioms (e.g., the power set axiom or the axiom of choice)\nmake general existence claims regarding the objects in the universe of\nsets.\n\nIn contrast, category theory represents a branch of abstract algebra,\nas its origin reveals. Thus it is, by its very nature, non-assertoric\nin character; it lacks existence axioms conceived as truths about an\nintended universe. For example, the Eilenberg-Mac Lane axioms of\ncategory theory are not \u201cbasic truths simpliciter\u201d, but\n\u201cschematic\u201d or \u201cstructural\u201d in character.\nThey function as implicit definitions of algebraic structures, similar\nto the way in which the axioms of group theory or ring theory are\n\u201cdefining conditions on types of structures\u201d. This point\nis related to another argument against the autonomy of category theory\nthat Hellmann calls the \u201cproblem of the \u2018home\naddress\u2019: where do categories come from and where do they\nlive?\u201d (2003: 136).  Given the \u201calgebraic-structuralist\nperspective\u201d underlying category theory and general topos\ntheory, its axioms make no assertions that particular categories or\ntopoi actually exist. Classical set theories, such as ZFC with its\nstrong existence axioms, have to step in again in order to secure the\nexistence of such objects.\n\nHellman\u2019s and Feferman\u2019s arguments against the\nfoundational character of category theory have been examined from\nvarious angles in the subsequent literature. One can distinguish\nbetween two main types of responses, namely:\n\n by proponents of \u201ccategorical \nfoundations\u201d, who aim\nto defend the autonomous character of category theory relative to\nclassical set theory; and\n by \u201cnon-foundationalists\u201d, \nwho call into question that category theory should be viewed as a foundational \ndiscipline.\n\n\nA series of articles by McLarty represent the first line of response\nwell (e.g., McLarty 2004, 2011, 2012). Roughly speaking, his reply to\nHellman is the following: Whereas category theory and general topos\ntheory did originate as algebraic theories and are, thus, not feasible\nas foundational systems, certain theories of particular categories and\ntoposes have been introduced as alternative\nfoundations. McLarty\u2019s central examples are Lawvere\u2019s\naxiomatizations of the category of categories and his\n\u201cElementary Theory of the Category of Sets\u201d (ETCS).\n\nAccording to McLarty, these theories should be understood as\nassertoric in Hellman\u2019s sense. That is to say, their axioms are\nnot merely implicit definitions, but general existential claims about\ncategories, sets, and functions. ETCS, for instance, presents a\nfunction-based set theory, where sets and mappings between them form a\ntopos. In contrast to ZFC, with its primitive membership relation, in\nETCS a set is not specified in terms of its internal composition, but\nrather in terms of its mapping properties with respect to other sets,\nwhich are formulated independently of ZFC. McLarty\u2019s response to\nthe two objections mentioned above is then that categorical set\ntheories such as ETCS do provide a foundation for mathematics that is\nlogically autonomous from traditional, non-structural set\ntheories. Moreover, given that mathematical structures can only be\nencoded in ETCS as objects up to isomorphism, such categorical set\ntheories provide a more adequate foundation for modern structural\nmathematics than ZFC.  (We will return to this point below.)\n\nThe second, quite different line of response to Hellman\u2019s\nobjections is represented in Awodey (2004; cf. Landry 1999). In that\narticle, Awodey outlines a category-theoretic form of structuralism\nthat is decidedly anti-foundationalist.  He holds, in agreement with\nHellman and McLarty, that both the Eilenberg-Mac Lane axioms for\ncategory theory and the axioms of general topos theory are schematic.\nBut he then argues that category theory in general does not, and\nshould not be taken to, provide a foundation for mathematics, either\nin a logical or ontological sense. Rather, it presents a general and\nunifying framework or language for structural mathematics.  He thus\nrejects Hellman\u2019s assumption that the success of categorical\nstructuralism is in any form dependent on whether category theory is\nusable as a foundational enterprise or not.\n\nIn fact, according to Awodey the central motivation for a\ncategory-theoretic approach to mathematics is to sidestep foundational\nissues concerning the nature of mathematical objects or the study of a\nsingle comprehensive universe in which all structures can be\nrepresented. While topos theory, say, might well serve as a structural\nfoundation for mathematics, for Awodey such a foundational approach\nruns against the structuralist perspective embodied in\ncategory-theory. In his own words, \u201cthe idea of \u2018doing\nmathematics categorically\u2019 involves a different point of view\nfrom the customary foundational one\u201d (Awodey 2004: 55). In light\nof such fundamental, ongoing debates about categorical foundations for\nmathematics, what are the implications for categorical structuralism\nin the philosophical sense, along Awodey\u2019s lines and more\ngenerally?  This is what we turn to next.\n",
