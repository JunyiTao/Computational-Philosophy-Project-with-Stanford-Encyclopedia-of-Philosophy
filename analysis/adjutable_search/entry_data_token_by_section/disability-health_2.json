    "main_text": "Disability and Well-Being || Disabilities and Objective Lists\n1.2 Disabilities and Objective Lists\n\nDerek Parfit has coined the term \u201cobjective list theories\u201d\nto refer to accounts that assess well-being in terms of a set of goods\nand activities that are objectively good for people (Parfit 1984:\n493ff). Some of the more contentious questions about the relationship\nbetween disability and individual well-being concern what objective\ngoods are indispensable for a good life and at what level of\ngenerality they should be described. Although \u201cobjective list\ntheories\u201d may suggest a simple checklist, they are better seen\nas recognizing (i) that there is an irreducible plurality in the goods\nof life and (ii) that their contribution to well-being cannot be\nexpressed in terms of a common metric, like utility. Both (i) and (ii)\ndistinguish objective list theories as a special case of objective or\nsubstantive-good theories of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, an\ninfluential objective list theorist, includes the following among her\nvaluable capabilities and functionings: health, nourishment, shelter,\nsex, mobility; the ability to use one\u2019s senses and to imagine,\nthink, and reason; family and other relationships, attachments and\nlove; living a life one has thought about and in some way chosen;\nlaughter, play, and living in contact with the natural world (Nussbaum\n1998: 135\u2013156). It is difficult to see what unifies all these\ndifferent categories, but item by item there would probably be\nwidespread agreement on their value and importance for individual\nwell-being. \n\nGiven that several of the items on Nussbaum\u2019s \u201998 list\ncannot be enjoyed by many people with disabilities, it follows that if\nhigh levels of well-being cannot be attained by someone who cannot\nenjoy all of the items on the list, then high levels of well-being are\nnot attainable by many people with disabilities. If that implication\nis false, then the list must be changed. For example, even if it is\nnecessary to include substantive goods or normative ideals in an\naccount of individual well-being, it is not clear that all of\nthe categories in Nussbaum\u2019s list, for example, are\nnecessary for high levels of well-being. As Jerome Segal\n(1998) points out, most of us would agree that a life can go very well\nwithout one or more of the capabilities Nussbaum regards as essential.\nIndeed, the most successful of lives of people lacking a single\ncapability may go as well as the most successful lives of people with\na standard complement of sensory and motor functions. Although a life\ncould hardly go well without at least some of these capacities, we\nhave no clear basis for establishing a minimum set.\n\nIn understanding how disability may be compatible with high levels of\nwell-being, understood in objective terms, it is helpful to\ndistinguish intrinsic from instrumental value. An activity may\nvaluable for itself, e.g., seeing as a rich sensory experience; or\ninstrumentally, for what it achieves or contributes to, e.g., seeing\nas a means of finding an object. As intuitive as the distinction\nseems, it is difficult to make clearly. First, there is deep\ndisagreement about what is of ultimate value. Second, it is possible\nto parse many activities and conditions indefinitely into\ninstrumentally valuable means and intrinsically valuable ends, e.g.,\nmaking money or friends can be seen as an end in itself, or as a means\nto obtaining comfort and security (see\n SEP entry on intrinsic vs. extrinsic value).\n\nThe social model of disability encourages us to recognize that many of\nthe activities precluded by certain disabilities can be seen\ninstrumentally, as means to valuable ends\u2014ends that can be\nachieved by other means that are not precluded by those disabilities.\nAs Asch contends (2003),\n\n\nThose who maintain that disability forecloses opportunity, and that\nany foreclosed opportunity diminishes life, focus too narrowly on the\nactivity and do not see it as a means to an end, e.g., \u2026\nwalking instead of mobilizing or exploring; talking instead of\ncommunicating.\n\n\nAs Asch suggests, much of what we value in seeing, talking, and\nwalking is instrumental. We value them as ways of achieving\ncommunication with other people, reading, and moving from place to\nplace, are themselves be bearers of intrinsic value. (Of course, we\nalso recognize that these activities have instrumental value as well,\ne.g., for finding social partners and business opportunities). None of\nthese valuable activities, however, is precluded by deafness,\nblindness, or paraplegia. Each can be achieved in alternative ways, by\nsigning, reading braille, or operating a wheelchair. If these\nconsiderations are on the right track, they show that the instrumental\nvalue of species-typical functioning is exaggerated, because its ends\ncan frequently be achieved in multiple ways, many of which are\navailable to people with fewer, impaired, or atypical functions.\n\nDisability scholars do not deny that typical sensory and motor\nfunctions can have great intrinsic as well as instrumental value, but\nthey argue that their intrinsic value is often understood too\nnarrowly. If, for example, we see the intrinsic value in sight not\nspecifically in visual experience, but in sensory and aesthetic\nexperience, then that value is not precluded by blindness.\n\nIt may be true that someone who cannot see or hear lacks experiences\nof great intrinsic value that are available to someone who can see or\nhear. However, the broad characterization favored by disability\nscholars seems most appropriate for assessing the role of intrinsic\nvalue in how well our lives go. For example, one obvious source of\nintrinsic value for standard sensory functions and activities is\naesthetic\u2014the beauty, richness, and complexity of the\nexperiences they enable. But we do not regard color-blindness,\ntone-deafness, or impairments of smell or taste as inimical to\nwell-being, although they preclude vast ranges of rich aesthetic\nexperience. There is no reason to doubt that someone who has never\nhad, or has long lost, those sensory functions (as opposed, say, to an\nvisual artist or food critic who relies on them for her vocation) can\nlead a life as rich and rewarding aesthetically as someone who has\nthose functions, despite lacking admittedly valuable experiences. This\nsuggests that we cannot infer from the fact that there is great value\nin a function that those who lack it have lives that go significantly\nless well. It is only plausible to claim that a good life needs to\ncontain certain kinds of valuable experiences and activities if those\nkinds of experience and activity are characterized very broadly. We\nwill have more to say about this below, in reviewing the debate over\nwhether disabilities can be seen as \u201cneutral\u201d\ncharacteristics.\n\nFinally, even granting the significance of objective goods for\nwell-being, it is not only their possession that makes a life go well.\nAlso relevant is how a life seems to the person living it, and this\nreintroduces subjective elements. Common sense supports the view that\nindividual well-being must have a subjective as well as an objective\naspect; \u201ctwo strands\u201d, as Jonathan Glover puts it (Glover\n2006: Chapter 3). Roughly speaking, well-being consists partly in\nhaving certain substantive goods and partly in being happy with (or\nbeing content with, or enjoying, or taking pleasure in) one\u2019s\nlife. But these strands may not be readily separable: the positive\nvaluation of objective goods may be necessary for the possession of\nthose goods to count towards well-being, or for their absence to count\nagainst it. Moreover, any plausible objective list must include\nenjoyment or pleasure, either as a free-standing good or as an aspect\nof valued states, activities or relationships.\n",
