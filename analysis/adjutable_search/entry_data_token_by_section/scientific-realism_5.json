    "main_text": "Considerations in Favor of Scientific Realism (and Responses) || Selective Optimism/Skepticism\n2.3 Selective Optimism/Skepticism\n\nIn\n section 1.3,\n the notion of selectivity was introduced as a general strategy for\nmaximizing the plausibility of realism, particularly with respect to\nscientific unobservables. This strategy is adopted in part to square\nrealism with the widely accepted view that most if not all of even our\nbest theories are false, strictly speaking. If, nevertheless, there\nare aspects of these theories that are true (or close to the truth)\nand one is able to identify these aspects, one might then plausibly\ncast one\u2019s realism in terms of an epistemically positive\nattitude toward those aspects of theories that are most worthy of\nepistemic commitment. The most important variants of realism to\nimplement this strategy are explanationism, entity realism, and\nstructural realism. (For related work pertaining to the notion of\nselectivity more generally, see R. Miller 1987: chs. 8\u201310; Fine\n1991; Jones 1991; Musgrave 1992; Harker 2013; and Peters 2014.)\n\nExplanationists hold that a realist attitude can be justified in\nconnection with unobservables described by our best theories precisely\nwhen appealing to those unobservables is indispensable or otherwise\nimportant to explaining why these theories are successful. For\nexample, if one takes successful novel prediction to be a hallmark of\ntheories worthy of realist commitment generally, then explanationism\nsuggests that, more specifically, those aspects of the theory that are\nessential to the derivation of such novel predictions are the parts of\nthe theory most worthy of realist commitment. In this vein, Kitcher\n(1993: 140\u2013149) draws a distinction between the\n\u201cpresuppositional posits\u201d or \u201cidle parts\u201d of\ntheories, and the \u201cworking posits\u201d to which realists\nshould commit. Psillos (1999: chs. 5\u20136) argues that realism can\nbe defended by demonstrating that the success of past theories did not\ndepend on their false components: \n\n\nit is enough to show that the theoretical laws and mechanisms which\ngenerated the successes of past theories have been retained in our\ncurrent scientific image. (1999: 108) \n\n\nThe immediate challenge to explanationism is to furnish a method with\nwhich to identify precisely those aspects of theories that are\nrequired for their success, in a way that is objective or principled\nenough to withstand the charge that realists are merely rationalizing\npost hoc, identifying the explanatorily crucial parts of past\ntheories with aspects that have been retained in our current best\ntheories. (For discussions, see Chang 2003; Stanford 2003a,b; Elsamahi\n2005; Saatsi 2005a; Lyons 2006; Harker 2010; Cordero 2011; Votsis\n2011; and Vickers 2013.)\n\nAnother version of realism that adopts the strategy of selectivity is\nentity realism. On this view, realist commitment is based on a\nputative ability to causally manipulate unobservable entities (like\nelectrons or gene sequences) to a high degree\u2014for example, to\nsuch a degree that one is able to intervene in other phenomena so as\nto bring about certain effects. The greater the ability to exploit\none\u2019s apparent causal knowledge of something so as to bring\nabout (often extraordinarily precise) outcomes, the greater the\nwarrant for belief (Hacking 1982, 1983; cf. B. Miller 2016; Cartwright\n1983: ch. 5; Giere 1988: ch. 5; on causal warrant more generally, see Egg 2012). Belief\nin scientific unobservables thus described is here partnered with a\ndegree of skepticism about scientific theories more generally, and\nthis raises questions about whether believing in entities while\nwithholding belief with respect to the theories that describe them is\na coherent or practicable combination (Morrison 1990; Elsamahi 1994;\nResnik 1994; Chakravartty 1998; Clarke 2001; Massimi 2004). Entity\nrealism is especially compatible with and nicely facilitated by the\ncausal theory of reference associated with Kripke (1980) and Putnam\n([1975b] 1985: ch. 12), according to which one can successfully refer\nto an entity despite significant or even radical changes in\ntheoretical descriptions of its properties; this allows for stability\nof epistemic commitment when theories change over time. Whether the\ncausal theory of reference can be applied successfully in this\ncontext, however, is a matter of dispute (see Hardin & Rosenberg\n1982; Laudan 1984; Psillos 1999: ch. 12; McLeish 2005, 2006; Chakravartty 2007a:\n52\u201356; and Landig 2014; see Weber 2014 for a case study on\ngenes).\n\nStructural realism is another view promoting selectivity, but in this\ncase it is the natures of unobservable entities that are viewed\nskeptically, with realism reserved for the structure of the\nunobservable realm, as represented by certain relations described by\nour best theories. All of the many versions of this position fall into\none of two camps: the first emphasizes an epistemic distinction\nbetween notions of structure and nature; the second emphasizes an\nontological thesis. The epistemic view holds that our best theories\nlikely do not correctly describe the natures of unobservable entities,\nbut do successfully describe certain relations between them. The ontic\nview suggests that the reason realists should aspire only to knowledge\nof structure is that the traditional concept of entities that stand in\nrelations is metaphysically problematic\u2014there are, in fact, no\nsuch things, or if there are such things, they are in some sense\nemergent from or dependent on their relations. One challenge facing\nthe epistemic version is that of articulating a concept of structure\nthat makes knowledge of it effectively distinct from that of the\nnatures of entities. The ontological version faces the challenge of\nclarifying the relevant notions of emergence and/or dependence. (On\nepistemic structural realism, see Worrall 1989; Psillos 1995, 2006;\nVotsis 2003; and Morganti 2004; regarding ontic structural realism,\nsee French 1998, 2006, 2014; Ladyman 1998; Psillos 2001, 2006; Ladyman\n& Ross 2007; and Chakravartty 2007a: ch. 3.
