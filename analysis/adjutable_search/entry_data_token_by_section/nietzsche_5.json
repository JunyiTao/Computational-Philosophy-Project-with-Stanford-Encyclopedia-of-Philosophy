    "main_text": "The Self and Self-fashioning\n4. The Self and Self-fashioning\n\nA probing investigation into the psyche was a leading preoccupation\nfor Nietzsche throughout his career, and this aspect of his thought\nhas rightly been accorded central importance across a long stretch of\nthe reception, all the way from Kaufmann (1950) to recent work by\nPippin (2010), Katsafanas (2016), Leiter (2019), Riccardi (2021), and\nothers. Some of Nietzsche\u2019s own programmatic reflections\nhighlight the centrality of this enterprise: perhaps most famously, he\ncloses an extended treatment of the shortcomings of previous\nphilosophy (in Part I of Beyond Good and Evil) with a\ndemand\n\n\nthat psychology be recognized again as the queen of the sciences, for\nwhose service and preparation the other sciences exist. For psychology\nis once again on the path to the fundamental problems. (BGE\n23)\n\n\nIn\n section 2,\n we saw that Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality rests crucially on\npsychological analyses that purport to expose the self-destructive\neffects of moral attitudes like guilt and ascetic self-denial, as well\nas the corrosive mismatch between the official claims of altruistic\nmorality and its underlying motivation in ressentiment. On\nthe positive side, Nietzsche is equally keen to detail the\npsychological conditions he thinks would be healthier for both\nindividuals and cultures (see, e.g., GS Pref. and 382;\nBGE 212; TI V, 3 and VIII, 6\u20137). Thus,\nNietzsche\u2019s psychology is central to his evaluative agenda and\nto his projects as a cultural critic. Aside from its instrumental\nsupport for these other projects, Nietzsche pursues psychological\ninquiry for its own sake, and also for the sake of the self-knowledge\nthat it intrinsically involves (GM III, 9; GS Pref.,\n3 and 324; but cf. GM Pref., 1). Still, despite widespread\nappreciation of Nietzsche\u2019s psychological acumen\u2014and\ndespite the centrality of psychology to his philosophical method, core\nquestions, and evaluative aims\u2014even the most basic outlines of\nhis substantive psychology remain a matter of controversy. Debate\nbegins with the object of psychology itself, the psyche, self, or\nsoul.\n\nA significant body of Nietzschean texts express extreme skepticism\nthat there is any such thing as a \u201cself\u201d, or\n\u201csoul\u201d, as well as doubts about the traditional faculties\nof the soul and the basic capacities they were supposed to exercise\n(thinking, willing, feeling). This passage from the notebooks is\ntypical\u2014\u201cTo indulge the fable of \u2018unity,\u2019\n\u2018soul,\u2019 \u2018person,\u2019 this we have forbidden: with\nsuch hypotheses one only covers up the problem\u201d (KSA\n37[4] 11: 577)\u2014and there are many, probably hundreds, like it\n(see D 109; GS 333; BGE 12, 17, 19, 54;\nGM I, 13; TI III, 5 and VI, 3). At the same time,\nNietzsche\u2019s own psychological analyses make free appeal not only\nto the self, but even to some of the traditional faculties (e.g., the\nwill) of which he is most skeptical elsewhere: for example, the\n\u201csovereign individual\u201d of GM II, 1\u20133 is\ndistinctive for developing a \u201cmemory of the will\u201d that\nunderwrites his capacity to keep promises and \u201cvouch for himself\nas future\u201d (GM I, 13); or again, Nietzsche\u2019s\nfavored strategy of deploying a multiplicity of perspectives in\nknowledge (see\n section 3.2.6)\n assumes the existence of a cognitive self that stands back from\nparticular drives and affects, and so has \u201cthe ability to\ncontrol one\u2019s Pro and Con and dispose of them\u201d in\nsupport of the larger cognitive project (GM III, 12, see also\nBGE 284).\n\nThis apparent conflict in the texts has encouraged competing\ninterpretations, with commentators emphasizing the strands in\nNietzsche to which they have more philosophical sympathy. For example,\nstrongly naturalist interpreters like Brian Leiter (2007, 2015, 2019)\nand Matthias Risse (2007) focus on Nietzsche\u2019s skepticism about\nthe will and the pure soul to reject any Kantian-style source of\nagency that can stand apart from and direct the person\u2019s basic\ndrives or fundamental nature. Somewhat similarly, readers attracted by\na Cartesian conception of consciousness as the essence of the mental,\nbut repelled by Cartesian dualism, highlight Nietzsche\u2019s\nemphasis on the importance of the body (GM III, 16;\nZ I, 4) to suggest that his apparent claims about psychology\nshould be heard instead as a kind of physiology of drives\nthat rejects mental psychology altogether (for different\nversions, see Poellner 1995: 216\u201329, 174; Haar [1993] 1996: 90,\net passim). Riccardi (2018, 2021) argues for a more nuanced\nview, in which the conscious self runs in parallel to the more\nfundamental bodily self. Attacking unity rather than mentality, a\ngroup of readers interested in Nietzsche\u2019s agonistic conception\nof politics tends to emphasize his similarly agonistic, internally\ncontested, conception of the self (Hatab 1995, 2018; Acampora 2013).\nIn a diametrically opposed direction from those first three, Sebastian\nGardner (2009) insists that, while Nietzsche was sometimes tempted by\nskepticism about a self which can stand back from the solicitations of\ninclination and control them, his own doctrines about the creation of\nvalue and self-overcoming in fact commit him to something like a\nKantian transcendental ego, despite his protestations to the\ncontrary.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s actual psychological explanations rely heavily on\nappeals to sub-personal psychological attitudes. As Janaway (2009: 52)\nobserves, a great many different kinds of attitude enter these\naccounts (including not only the standard beliefs and desires of\ncurrent-day moral psychology, but also \u201cwills\u201d, feelings,\nsensations, moods, imaginings, memories, valuations, convictions, and\nmore), but arguably the core attitudes that do the most work for him\nare drives and affects. These attitude types have\nbeen intensively studied in recent work (see esp. Richardson 1996,\n2020; Katsafanas 2011b, 2013, 2016; Alfano 2019; Leiter 2019; and\nRiccardi 2021; see also Anderson 2012a, Clark and Dudrick 2015, Creasy\n2020). While much remains controversial, it is helpful to think of\ndrives as dispositions toward general patterns of activity; they aim\nat activity of the relevant sort (e.g., an eating drive, a drive for\npower), and they also represent some more specific object or occasion\nof the activity in a particular case (e.g., this ice cream, or\novercoming a particular problem in the course of writing a paper).\nAffects are emotional states that combine a receptive and felt\nresponsiveness to the world with a tendency toward a distinctive\npattern of reaction\u2014states like love, hate, anger, fear, joy,\netc. Typically, the sub-personal attitudes postulated in\nNietzsche\u2019s psychological explanations represent the world in\none way or another. Since he endorses Leibniz\u2019s thought that\nrepresentation, not consciousness, is the decisive mark of the mental\n(GS 354; see Simmons 2001, for discussion), it is reasonable\nto treat these attitudes as distinctively psychological, whether they\nare conscious or not.\n\nBut what about a personal-level self to serve as the owner of such\nattitudes? It seems that Nietzsche\u2019s postulated drives and\naffects could not coherently be counted as psychological (and\nsub-personal) without such a self, and yet, the skeptical\npassages canvassed above seem to rule out any such thing. This remains\na controversial problem, but it is clear at least that\nNietzsche\u2019s own proposal was to develop a radically reformed\nconception of the psyche, rather than to reject the self, or soul,\naltogether (see Riccardi 2021). BGE 12 provides some\nprovocative ideas about what such a reformed conception might involve:\nthere, Nietzsche insists that we should \u201cgive the finishing\nstroke\u201d to what he calls \u201cthe soul\natomism\u201d, which he goes on to explain as\n\n\nthe belief which regards the soul as something indestructible,\neternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon:\u2026\nBetween ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of \u201cthe\nsoul\u201d at the same time, and thus to renounce one of the most\nancient and venerable hypotheses\u2014as happens frequently to clumsy\nnaturalists who can hardly touch on \u201cthe soul\u201d without\nimmediately losing it. But the way is now open for new versions and\nrefinements of the soul hypothesis, [including] \u201cmortal\nsoul\u201d, \u201csoul as subjective multiplicity\u201d, and\n\u201csoul as social structure of the drives and\naffects\u201d\u2026 (BGE 12)\n\n\nHere Nietzsche alludes to traditional rational psychology, and its\nbasic inference from the pure unity of consciousness to the\nsimplicity of the soul, and thence to its indivisibility and\nimmortality. As he notes, these moves treat the soul as an indivisible\n(hence incorruptible) atom, or monad. Nietzsche\u2019s alternative\nproposal takes its shape from the rejection of such atomism\u2014the\nsoul as he understands it will be internally complex, rather than\nsimple, and therefore subject to disintegration. That idea informs\nNietzsche\u2019s striking slogans about the soul\u2019s\n\u201cmortality\u201d, \u201cmultiplicity\u201d, and internal\n\u201csocial structure\u201d. The \u201cdrives and affects\u201d\nare evidently supposed to serve as the constituents comprising this\nmultiplicity. Nietzsche thus construes the psyche, or self, as an\nemergent structure arising from such sub-personal constituents (when\nthose stand in the appropriate relations), thereby reversing the\ntraditional account, which treats sub-personal attitudes as mere\nmodes, or ways of being, proper to a preexisting unitary mental\nsubstance\u2014(see Anderson 2012a for an attempt to flesh out the\npicture; see also Gemes 2001; Hales and Welshon 2000: 157\u201382;\nRiccardi 2021; Anderson 2021). But however vulnerable, mortal, and\nsubject to inner division the soul is supposed to be on the reformed\nconception, it nevertheless remains (as Nietzsche\u2019s rejection of\nreductive naturalism makes clear) a genuinely psychological\nentity over and above its constituent drives and affects. Moreover,\nsince the drives and affects that constitute it are individuated\nlargely in terms of what (and how) they represent, the\npsychology needed to investigate the soul must be an interpretive, and\nnot merely and strictly a causal, form of inquiry (see Pippin 2010;\nRidley 2018).\n\nIn these respects, Nietzsche\u2019s psychology treats the self as\nsomething that has to be achieved or constructed, rather than\nas something fundamentally given as part of the basic\nmetaphysical equipment with which a person enters the world. This idea\nof the self as achieved rather than given was noticed already by\nSchacht (1983), and was elevated into a central theme in\nNehamas\u2019s (1985) influential Nietzsche interpretation. On that\nreading, the project of individual self-fashioning, or self-creation,\nis located at the heart of Nietzsche\u2019s philosophical agenda (see\nesp. GS 290, 335; TI IX, 49). Highlighting\nNietzsche\u2019s commitments to the values of artistry and\nindividuality, the interpretation claims that the main goal of\nNietzsche\u2019s new philosophers would be to construct novel,\ninteresting, and culturally resonant individual lives, whose overall\nshape they could affirm (despite whatever setbacks they involve) on\nthe strength of the (broadly) aesthetic value they instantiate. In\nNehamas\u2019s version, this agenda was closely bound up with\nNietzsche\u2019s project as a writer; he is supposed to have created\nhimself, in the relevant sense, as an authorial persona through\nwriting such distinctive books (Nehamas 1985; see esp. 233\u20134).\nWhile this suggestion, and even the very idea of self-creation, has\nremained controversial both textually and philosophically (see, e.g.,\nPippin 2010: 109\u201311), it has led to much further work\u2014some\ndirectly influenced by Nehamas (1985), some developed in partial or\nentire opposition to it\u2014yielding real insights about the nature\nof Nietzschean selfhood, and the relations among the key ideas of\nself-creation, the creation of value, individuality, and Nietzschean\nfreedom (see, e.g., Gerhardt 1992; Nehamas 1998: 128\u201356; Leiter\n1998; May 1999: 107\u201326; Anderson and Landy 2001; Reginster 2003;\nAnderson 2005, 2009, 2012a. 2021; Ridley 2007a, 2007b, 2018; Gardner\n2009; Gemes 2009a, 2019; Pippin 2009, 2010; Poellner 2009; Richardson\n2009, 2020; Acampora 2013; Katsafanas 2016: 164\u201396,\n220\u201356; Anderson and Cristy 2017; Rutherford 2018).\n\nOne especially sustained alternative to Nehamas (1985) is developed by\nElijah Millgram (2007, 2020, 2023). He argues that, so far from using his\nauthorship to fashion a unified character for himself, Nietzsche was\n(on the contrary) a disunified, or even disintegrating,\nagent. On Millgram\u2019s construal, Nietzsche\u2019s books develop\na strategy for constructing a meaningful life that is suitable for\npeople of that sort. This represents an interesting kind of limit case\nfor the project of self-fashioning, which mounts a sustained critique\nagainst the widespread assumption in modern philosophy that unity of\nagency is always desirable or valuable.\n",
