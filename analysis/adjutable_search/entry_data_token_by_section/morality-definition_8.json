Without an explicit definition, it may be easier to ignore\nthe fact that act-consequentialist theories are not particularly\nconcerned with interpersonal interactions, but typically apply just as\nwell to desert island scenarios as to individuals who live in\nsocieties. In any case, it has been recognized that in order to combat\nconsequentialism, it would be helpful to have something like a\nplausible definition of morality that made it clear that the subject\nmatter of morality is something different from simply the goodness and\nbadness of consequences. T.M. Scanlon (1982, 1998), applying this\nstrategy, suggests that the subject matter of morality\u2014what we\nare talking about, when we talk about morality\u2014is a system of\nrules for the regulation of behavior that is not reasonably rejectable\nbased on a desire for informed unforced general agreement.\n\nScanlon\u2019s suggestion regarding the subject matter of morality\ncan easily be seen as an instance of the general schema given above.\nHis \u201csystem of rules\u201d is a specific kind of informal\npublic system; he understands endorsement by all rational people as\nnon-rejection by all reasonable people; and he offers a specific\naccount of the conditions under which moral agents would reach the\nrelevant agreement. But Scanlon also places very heavy emphasis on the\nfact that if he is right about the subject matter of morality, then\nwhat compliance with moral norms allows us to do is to justify our\nbehavior to others in ways that they cannot reasonably reject. Indeed,\nthe ability to justify ourselves to reasonable people is a primary\nsource of moral motivation for Scanlon (see also Sprigge 1964: 319).\nThis might seem to suggest a somewhat different definitional claim\nabout morality: that morality consists in the most basic norms in\nterms of which we justify ourselves to others. But it is plausible\nthat this purportedly definitional claim is better thought of as a\ncorollary of Scanlon\u2019s particular version of the general schema,\nwith endorsement understood as non-rejection. For, if morality is the\nsystem of norms that would be endorsed in this way, we can justify our\nactions to others by pointing out that even they, were they\nreasonable, would have endorsed rules that allowed our behavior.\n\nStephen Darwall\u2019s (2006) moral view can also be seen as flowing\nfrom a version of the general schema, and yielding claims about\njustifiability to others. Darwall claims that morality is a matter of equal accountability among free and rational beings. On his view, I\nbehave morally towards you to the degree that I respect the claims you\nhave authority to make on me. Darwall also holds that I will respect\nthose claims if I acknowledge certain assumptions to which I am\ncommitted simply in virtue of being a rational, deliberating agent. As\na result, his view is that morality\u2014or at least the morality of\nobligation\u2014is a \u201cscheme of accountability\u201d (a\ncertain sort of informal public system) that all rational people will\nendorse. Unlike Scanlon\u2019s view, however, Darwall\u2019s view\nmakes use of a stronger sense of endorsement than non-rejection.\nSpecifically, it includes the recognition of the reasons provided by\nthe authoritative demands of other people. And that recognition is\npositively motivational.\n\nBoth Scanlon\u2019s and Darwall\u2019s views emphasize the social\nnature of morality, taken in the normative sense: Scanlon, by\nreference to justification to others; Darwall, by appeal to the\nrelevance of second-personal reasons. But Darwall builds a\nresponsiveness to second-personal reasons into the relevant notion of\nrationality, while Scanlon simply makes the empirical claim that many\npeople are motivated by a desire to justify themselves to others, and\nnotes that his definition of morality will yield rules that will allow\none to do this, if one follows them. The sort of definition described\nin\n section 5.1\n also makes the social nature of morality essential to it, since it\ncentrally features the notion of a response to the behavior of others.\nThe definitions described in sections\n 5.2\n and\n 5.3\n do not entail the social nature of morality, since it is\npossible to accept, and even to advocate, a code that concerns only\nself-regarding behavior. But on any plausible account of rationality a\ncode that would be advocated by all moral agents will govern\ninterpersonal interactions, and will include rules that prohibit\ncausing harm without sufficient reason. Only the definition offered in\n section 5.3\n therefore can be taken as realistically compatible with an egoistic\nmorality.\n",
